{"ori_id":"76704480af32a57c3b72444e2fbe5cf855df37e8","title":"Testimony of the Evangelists","context":"Testimony of the Evangelists\n Greenleaf begins his book by arguing for the need to suspend prejudices and to be open to conviction, \"to follow the truth wherever it may lead us\" (p.\u00a01). He cites Bishop Daniel Wilson's Evidences by stating that Christianity does not \"bring irresistible evidence\" but offers sufficient evidences for \"the serious inquirer\" (p.\u00a02). He limits the scope of his book to an inquiry \"to the testimony of the Four Evangelists, bringing their narratives to the tests to which other evidence is subjected in human tribunals\" (p.\u00a02). His specific inquiry is concerned with testing \"the veracity of these witnesses by the same rules and means\" employed in human tribunals (p.\u00a03). Greenleaf argues the case by first inquiring as to the genuineness of the four gospels as ancient writings. Here he applies what is known in law as the ancient documents rule, stating that \"Every document, apparently ancient, coming from the proper repository or custody, and bearing on its face no evident marks of forgery, the law presumes to be genuine, and devolves on the opposing party the burden of proving it to be otherwise\" (p.\u00a07). Greenleaf maintains that the Four Gospels do not bear any marks of being forgeries and the oldest extant copies may be received into court as genuine documents.\nGreenleaf proceeds to argue that \"In matters of public and general interest, all persons must be presumed to be conversant, on the principle that individuals are presumed to be conversant with their own affairs\" (p.\u00a09). On the basis of this legal rule, Greenleaf briefly profiles those traditionally attributed as authors of the Four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, concerning (in the case of John and Matthew) their firsthand knowledge of the life of Jesus of Nazareth and (in the case of Mark and Luke) their intimate personal links with Jesus' original band of disciples.\nGreenleaf then builds a cumulative case by claiming to cross-examine the oral testimony of the evangelists in their accounts of the death and resurrection of Jesus. Greenleaf develops his case on the basis of the following tests:\n\"The credit due to the testimony of witnesses depends upon, firstly, their honesty; secondly, their ability; thirdly, their number and the consistency of their testimony; fourthly, the conformity of their testimony with experience; and fifthly, the coincidence of their testimony with collateral circumstances\" (p. 28).\nGreenleaf then argues that the gospel writers can be shown to be honest in their character and do not show any motives to falsify their testimony (pp.\u00a028\u201331). He claims that keen observations and meticulous details are related by Matthew and Luke, and he concludes this demonstrates their ability (pp.\u00a031\u201332). Greenleaf notes that there are parallel accounts from the evangelists concerning the central events of Jesus' life and that these accounts are not verbally identical. He maintains that discrepancies in their accounts are evidence that the writers are not guilty of collusion, and that the discrepancies in their respective accounts can be resolved or harmonized upon careful cross-examination and comparison of the details (pp 32\u201335). Greenleaf argues against the scepticism of the Scottish empirical philosopher David Hume concerning reports of miracles. He finds fault with Hume's position about \"immutable laws from the uniform course of human experience\" (p.\u00a036), and goes on to assert that it is a fallacy because \"it excludes all knowledge derived by inference or deduction from facts, confining us to what we derive from experience alone\" (pp.\u00a037\u201338). Greenleaf takes as his own assumption that as God exists then such a being is capable of performing miracles. He then argues that the various miracles reported in Jesus' ministry occurred in open or public contexts where friend and foe alike were witnesses (pp 39\u201342). Lastly, Greenleaf examines the problem of uniform testimony among false and genuine witnesses, and finds there is sufficient circumstantial evidence to support the accounts of the Four Evangelists.\nGreenleaf sums up his argument with the following plea:\n\"All that Christianity asks of men on this subject, is, that they would be consistent with themselves; that they would treat its evidences as they treat the evidence of other things; and that they would try and judge its actors and witnesses, as they deal with their fellow men, when testifying to human affairs and actions, in human tribunals. Let the witnesses be compared with themselves, with each other, and with the surrounding facts and circumstances; and let their testimony be sifted, as if it were given in a court of justice, on the side of the adverse party, the witnesses being subjected to a rigorous cross-examination. The result, it is confidently believed, will be an undoubting conviction of their integrity, ability and truth ... Either the men of Galilee were men of superlative wisdom, and extensive knowledge and experience, and of deeper skill in the arts of deception, than any and all others, before or after them, or they have truly stated the astonishing things which they saw and heard\" (pp. 46 & 53).\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of An Examination of the Testimony of the Four\nEvangelists by Simon Greenleaf, LL.D.\n\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost no\nrestrictions whatsoever.

Among these advocates of Divine\nRevelation, the profound lawyer, Professor Greenleaf, holds a most\nhonourable and distinguished place; and his work may justly be regarded as\ncombining sound and practical knowledge with well-directed zeal and piety.\nIts character has been very fairly appreciated in two leading North\nAmerican journals, from which the following extracts are made, as\nindicative of its contents, and also of the high estimation in which its\nlearned author is deservedly held in his own country.\n\n\n    EXTRACT OF A NOTICE OF PROFESSOR GREENLEAF ON THE FOUR GOSPELS,\n    OCTOBER 24, 1846, IN \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHE NEW YORK OBSERVER.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    The Author is a lawyer, very learned in his profession, acute,\n    critical and used to raising and meeting practical doubts. Author\n    of a treatise on the law of evidence, which has already become a\n    classic in the hands of the profession which he adorns, and\n    teaches in one of the Law Seminaries which do honour to our\n    country in the eyes of Europe, he brings rare qualifications for\n    the task he assumes. That he should, with the understanding and\n    from the heart, accept the Gospel as the truth, avow it as his\n    Hope, and seek to discharge a duty to his fellow-men by laying\n    before them the grounds on which he founds this acceptance and\n    this hope, are cheering circumstances to the Christian, and\n    present strong appeals to the indifferent.\n\n    To his profession, to the lawyers of the country, however, this\n    work makes a strong appeal. They are a very secular profession.\n    Their business is almost wholly conversant with material\n    interests. Their time is absorbed in controversies, of passion, or\n    of interest. Acute, critical, and disputatious, they apparently\n    present a field unpropitious for the acceptance of a religion,\n    spiritual, disinterested, and insisting on perfect holiness.\n    Still, they necessarily need to know and must enforce the rules of\n    finding truth and justice; the principles for ascertaining truth\n    and dispensing justice are the great subjects of all their\n    discussions, so far as they are discussions of any general\n    principle. From this cause it is, that this profession has\n    numbered among its members, in every age, Christians of great\n    eminence, and in our own day and country, we cannot turn to the\n    eminent men of this profession in any large community, without the\n    satisfaction of finding our Faith embraced by those whose habits\n    of practical as well as speculative investigation render them\n    evidently the best able to appreciate its claims and to detect any\n    imperfections in its proof.\n\n    So we trust it always may be; and we are assured that the best\n    models of the mode of investigating matters of legal controversy\n    as the proof of facts, are writings on the evidences. Paley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n    treatise and that of Chalmers, on the oral testimony in favour of\n    Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mission, Paley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examination of the writings of the\n    apostle Paul, are, we are assured, the best models extant for\n    forming the habit of examining oral and documentary evidence.\n    These are subjects on which it is of vital importance, in a\n    secular view, that a lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s habits should be right: in a\n    spiritual view the importance is unspeakable. Mr. Greenleaf has\n    doubtless felt this truth, and has also felt that his position\n    would give to his labours some authority with his brethren and\n    with the public. He has given himself honourably to the labour,\n    and spread its results before the world.\n\n    It is long since Infidelity has found its advocates among the\n    truly learned. Among the guesses and speculations of a small\n    portion of unsanctified medical men, she still finds now and then\n    a champion. Historians and philosophers have long since discussed\n    her pretensions. And now from the Jurists and Lawyers, the\n    practical masters of this kind of investigation, works are\n    appearing, whereby not only an earnest reception of the Gospel is\n    manifested, but the mode and means of action and of credit by\n    which all human affairs are governed.\n\n    We lose in respect to our own investigations on this subject by\n    its very sacredness. We have an idle dread, that it is not open to\n    free investigation: to severe practical tests. We need to be\n    invited, to be pressed to examine this subject freely. Dr.\n    Chalmers in one department of this inquiry has led the way. Mr.\n    Greenleaf in another has also presented an example. And it will\n    not be competent, after these men have thus investigated and\n    taught the rules and laws of investigation, for any man who is not\n    willing to arrogate superior claims to learning and ability, to\n    turn aside superciliously from an examination of the Gospels.\n\n    Such are our views of this work, which we commend to all: to the\n    legal profession, from the character of its topics and the rank of\n    its author: to men desirous of knowledge, in every rank in life,\n    because of its presenting this subject under such a treatment as\n    every-day practical questions are treated with. It does not touch\n    the intrinsic evidences of the Gospel: those which to the believer\n    are, after all, the highest proofs. But it is to be remembered,\n    that these are proofs which are not satisfactory until an\n    examination of the outward evidences has led men to the\n    conviction, that the Gospels cannot be false.\n\n    FROM THE \u00e2\u0080\u009cNORTH AMERICAN REVIEW.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n    _Professor Greenleaf on the Gospels, and Strauss\u00e2\u0080\u0099 __\u00e2\u0080\u009c__Life of\n    Jesus.__\u00e2\u0080\u009d_\u00e2\u0080\u0094Of course we place the titles of these two books\n    together only by way of contrast. They relate, it is true, to the\n    same general subject; but it is hard to conceive of two works more\n    unlike in their scope, character, and purpose. The object of the\n    one is to prove, and of the other to disprove, the Christian\n    religion. The one is the production of an able and profound\n    lawyer, a man who has grown grey in the halls of justice and the\n    schools of jurisprudence,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a writer of the highest authority on\n    legal subjects, whose life has been spent in weighing testimony\n    and sifting evidence, and whose published opinions on the rules of\n    evidence are received as authoritative in all the English and\n    American tribunals,\u00e2\u0080\u0094for fourteen years the highly respected\n    colleague of the late Mr. Justice Story, and now the honoured head\n    of the most distinguished and prosperous school of English law in\n    the world. The other is the work of a German professor and\n    speculatist, also profoundly learned in his way,\u00e2\u0080\u0094an ingenious and\n    erring framer of theories of the most striking character, almost\n    unheard of till his brain either conceived them or gave them\n    currency, though relating to topics with which men have been\n    familiar for eighteen centuries,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a subtle controversialist, whose\n    work, as he himself avows, is deeply tinged with the most strongly\n    marked peculiarities of the philosophy and theology of his\n    countrymen. We presume the most ardent admirer of Dr. Strauss will\n    not object to our characterising the two works as excellent\n    specimens, the one of clear and shrewd English common sense, the\n    other of German erudition, laborious diligence, and fertility in\n    original speculation. And if the subject of inquiry were one that\n    involved his own temporal and immediate interests, and it were\n    necessary to determine which of these two writers would give the\n    wiser and safer counsel, or the more trustworthy opinion, we\n    suppose the same person would agree with us in making the choice.\n\n\nOn the publishers announcing to Professor Greenleaf their wish to\nintroduce his Harmony to the notice of the British Public, he with equal\npromptitude and kindness communicated to them some important additions to\nhis Introduction, and also numerous valuable notes, more particularly\nadapted to the use of Theological Students. These are now printed for the\nfirst time: and at the suggestion of a very eminent and learned clergyman\nof the Established Church, the publishers have added in an Appendix an\naccurate and elegant translation of the late learned French Advocate, A.\nM. J. J. Dupin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Refutation of the eminent Jewish writer, Joseph\nSalvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrial and Condemnation of Jesus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d executed by the late\ndistinguished American Lawyer and Statesman, JOHN PICKERING, LL.D.,\nCounsellor at Law, and President of the American Academy of Arts and\nSciences (sometime Secretary to the American Embassy in this country); who\nhas most truly characterised M. Dupin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examination of Salvador, as being\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cconducted with an ability, learning, animation, and interest, that leave\nnothing to be desired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION.\n\n\nGENTLEMEN,\n\nThe subject of the following work I hope will not be deemed so foreign to\nour professional pursuits, as to render it improper for me to dedicate it,\nas I now respectfully do, to you. If a close examination of the evidences\nof Christianity may be expected of one class of men more than another, it\nwould seem incumbent on us, who make the law of evidence one of our\npeculiar studies. Our profession leads us to explore the mazes of\nfalsehood, to detect its artifices, to pierce its thickest veils, to\nfollow and expose its sophistries, to compare the statements of different\nwitnesses with severity, to discover truth and separate it from error. Our\nfellow-men are well aware of this; and probably they act upon this\nknowledge more generally, and with a more profound repose, than we are in\nthe habit of considering. The influence, too, of the legal profession upon\nthe community is unquestionably great; conversant, as it daily is, with\nall classes and grades of men, in their domestic and social relations, and\nin all the affairs of life, from the cradle to the grave. This influence\nwe are constantly exerting for good or ill; and hence, to refuse to\nacquaint ourselves with the evidences of the Christian religion, or to act\nas though, having fully examined, we lightly esteemed them, is to assume\nan appalling amount of responsibility.\n\nThe things related by the Evangelists are certainly of the most momentous\ncharacter, affecting the principles of our conduct here, and our happiness\nfor ever. The religion of Jesus Christ aims at nothing less than the utter\noverthrow of all other systems of religion in the world; denouncing them\nas inadequate to the wants of man, false in their foundations, and\ndangerous in their tendency. It not only solicits the grave attention of\nall, to whom its doctrines are presented, but it demands their cordial\nbelief, as a matter of vital concernment. These are no ordinary claims;\nand it seems hardly possible for a rational being to regard them with even\na subdued interest; much less to treat them with mere indifference and\ncontempt. If not true, they are little else than the pretensions of a bold\nimposture, which, not satisfied with having already enslaved millions of\nthe human race, seeks to continue its encroachments upon human liberty,\nuntil all nations shall be subjugated under its iron rule. But if they are\nwell founded and just, they can be no less than the high requirements of\nHeaven, addressed by the voice of God to the reason and understanding of\nman, concerning things deeply affecting his relations to his sovereign,\nand essential to the formation of his character and of course to his\ndestiny, both for this life and for the life to come. Such was the\nestimate taken of religion, even the religion of pagan Rome, by one of the\ngreatest lawyers of antiquity, when he argued that it was either nothing\nat all, or was everything. _Aut undique religionem tolle, aut usquequaque\nconserva._(1)\n\nWith this view of the importance of the subject, and in the hope that the\npresent work may in some degree aid or at least incite others to a more\nsuccessful pursuit of this interesting study, it is submitted to your kind\nregard, by\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSIMON GREENLEAF.\n\nHARVARD UNIVERSITY,\nDANE HALL, _May 1, 1846_.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS AND SYNOPSIS OF THE HARMONY.\n\n\n_The figures in the first column refer to the corresponding Sections in_\nNEWCOME\u00e2\u0080\u0099S HARMONY. _Those in the second column to the Sections in this\nWork._\n\nSect.

But by comparing his order with that of Archbishop\nNewcome, as shown in contiguous columns in the Table of Contents and\nSynopsis of the Harmony, it will be found that they differ only in a very\nfew unimportant particulars, not at all affecting the general scheme or\nstructure of the Harmony, or the purposes of this examination. I have,\nhowever, in several places omitted their transposition of the verses of\nthe text, occurring within the limits of a section; it being more\nconvenient to insert them in the order in which they were written by the\nEvangelists.\n\nThe preliminary Dissertation has been revised and enlarged, and some\nfurther notes added to the text, which is printed conformably to the\ncommon octavo edition of the American Bible Society, except in a few\nplaces, where the article a was accidentally printed instead of _an_, in\nthe words _an house_, &c.\n\nCambridge, Massachusetts,\n_March_ 1, 1847.\n\n\n\n\n\nAN EXAMINATION, ETC.\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1. In examining the evidences of the Christian religion, it is essential\nto the discovery of truth that we bring to the investigation a mind freed,\nas far as possible, from existing prejudice and open to conviction. There\nshould be a readiness, on our part, to investigate with candour, to follow\nthe truth wherever it may lead us, and to submit, without reserve or\nobjection, to all the teachings of this religion, if it be found to be of\ndivine origin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no other entrance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Lord Bacon, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto the\nkingdom of man, which is founded in the sciences, than to the kingdom of\nheaven, into which no one can enter but in the character of a little\nchild.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(2) The docility which true philosophy requires of her disciples is\nnot a spirit of servility, or the surrender of the reason and judgment to\nwhatsoever the teacher may inculcate; but it is a mind free from all pride\nof opinion, not hostile to the truth sought for, willing to pursue the\ninquiry and impartially to weigh the arguments and evidence, and to\nacquiesce in the judgment of right reason. The investigation, moreover,\nshould be pursued with the serious earnestness which becomes the greatness\nof the subject\u00e2\u0080\u0094a subject fraught with such momentous consequences to man.\nIt should be pursued as in the presence of God, and under the solemn\nsanctions created by a lively sense of his omniscience, and of our\naccountability to him for the right use of the faculties which he has\nbestowed.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2. In requiring this candour and simplicity of mind in those who would\ninvestigate the truth of our religion, Christianity demands nothing more\nthan is readily conceded to every branch of human science. All these have\ntheir data, and their axioms; and Christianity, too, has her first\nprinciples, the admission of which is essential to any real progress in\nknowledge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cChristianity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Bishop Wilson, \u00e2\u0080\u009cinscribes on the portal of\nher dominions, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little\nchild, shall in nowise enter therein.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Christianity does not profess to\nconvince the perverse and headstrong, to bring irresistible evidence to\nthe daring and profane, to vanquish the proud scorner, and afford\nevidences from which the careless and perverse cannot possibly escape.\nThis might go to destroy man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility. All that Christianity\nprofesses, is to propose such evidences as may satisfy the meek, the\ntractable, the candid, the serious inquirer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(3)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3. The present design, however, is not to enter upon any general\nexamination of the evidences of Christianity, but to confine the inquiry\nto the testimony of the Four Evangelists, bringing their narratives to the\ntests to which other evidence is subjected in human tribunals. The\nfoundation of our religion is a basis of fact\u00e2\u0080\u0094the fact of the birth,\nministry, miracles, death, resurrection, and ascension of Jesus Christ.\nThese are related by the Evangelists as having actually occurred, within\ntheir own personal knowledge. Our religion, then, rests on the credit due\nto these witnesses. Are they worthy of implicit belief, in the matters\nwhich they relate? This is the question, in all human tribunals, in regard\nto persons testifying before them; and we propose to test the veracity of\nthese witnesses, by the same rules and means which are there employed. The\nimportance of the facts testified, and their relations to the affairs of\nthe soul, and the life to come, can make no difference in the principles\nor the mode of weighing the evidence. It is still the evidence of matters\nof fact, capable of being seen and known and related, as well by one man\nas by another. And if the testimony of the Evangelist, supposing it to be\nrelevant and material to the issue in a question of property or of\npersonal right, between man and man, in a court of justice, ought to be\nbelieved and have weight; then, upon the like principles, it ought to\nreceive our entire credit here. But if, on the other hand, we should be\njustified in rejecting it, if there testified on oath, then, supposing our\nrules of evidence to be sound, we may be excused if we hesitate elsewhere\nto give it credence.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4. The proof that God has revealed himself to man by special and express\ncommunications, and that Christianity constitutes that revelation, is no\npart of these inquiries. This has already been shown, in the most\nsatisfactory manner, by others, who have written expressly upon this\nsubject.(4) Referring therefore to their writings for the arguments and\nproofs, the fact will here be assumed as true. That man is a religious\nbeing, is universally conceded, for it has been seen to be universally\ntrue. He is everywhere a worshipper. In every age and country, and in\nevery stage, from the highest intellectual culture to the darkest\nstupidity, he bows with homage to a superior Being. Be it the rude-carved\nidol of his own fabrication, or the unseen divinity that stirs within him,\nit is still the object of his adoration. This trait in the character of\nman is so uniform, that it may safely be assumed, either as one of the\noriginal attributes of his nature, or as necessarily resulting from the\naction of one or more of those attributes.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5. The object of man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worship, whatever it be, will naturally be his\nstandard of perfection. He clothes it with every attribute, belonging, in\nhis view, to a perfect character; and this character he himself endeavours\nto attain. He may not, directly and consciously, aim to acquire every\nvirtue of his deity, and to avoid the opposite vices; but still this will\nbe the inevitable consequence of sincere and constant worship. As in human\nsociety men become assimilated, both in manners and in moral principles,\nto their chosen associates, so in the worship of whatever deity men adore,\nthey \u00e2\u0080\u009cform to his the relish of their souls.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To suppose, then, that God\nmade man capable of religion, and requiring it in order to the development\nof the highest part of his nature, without communicating with him, as a\nfather, in those revelations which alone could perfect that nature, would\nbe a reproach upon God, and a contradiction.(5)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6. How it came to pass that man, originally taught, as we doubt not he\nwas, to know and to worship the true Jehovah, is found, at so early a\nperiod of his history, a worshipper of baser objects, it is foreign to our\npresent purpose to inquire. But the fact is lamentably true, that he soon\nbecame an idolater, a worshipper of moral abominations. The Scythians and\nNorthmen adored the impersonations of heroic valour and of bloodthirsty\nand cruel revenge. The mythology of Greece and of Rome, though it\nexhibited a few examples of virtue and goodness, abounded in others of\ngross licentiousness and vice. The gods of Egypt were reptiles, and beasts\nand birds. The religion of Central and Eastern Asia was polluted with lust\nand cruelty, and smeared with blood, rioting, in deadly triumph, over all\nthe tender affections of the human heart and all the convictions of the\nhuman understanding. Western and Southern Africa and Polynesia are, to\nthis day, the abodes of frightful idolatry, cannibalism, and cruelty; and\nthe aborigines of both the Americas are examples of the depths of\nsuperstition to which the human mind may be debased. In every quarter of\nthe world, however, there is a striking uniformity seen, in all the\nfeatures of paganism. The ruling principle of her religion is terror, and\nher deity is lewd and cruel. Whatever of purity the earlier forms of\npaganism may have possessed, it is evident from history that it was of\nbrief duration. Every form, which history has preserved, grew rapidly and\nsteadily worse and more corrupt, until the entire heathen world, before\nthe coming of Christ, was infected with that loathsome leprosy of\npollution, described with revolting vividness by St. Paul, in the\nbeginning of his Epistle to the Romans.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7. So general and decided was this proclivity to the worship of strange\ngods, that, at the time of the deluge, only one family remained faithful\nto Jehovah; and this was a family which had been favoured with his special\nrevelation. Indeed it is evident that nothing but a revelation from God\ncould raise men from the degradation of pagan idolatry, because nothing\nelse has ever had that effect. If man could achieve his own freedom from\nthis bondage, he would long since have been free. But instead of this, the\nincrease of light and civilization and refinement in the pagan world has\nbut multiplied the objects of his worship, added voluptuous refinements to\nits ritual, and thus increased the number and weight of his chains. In\nthis respect there is no difference in their moral condition, between the\nbarbarous Scythian and the learned Egyptian or Roman of ancient times, nor\nbetween the ignorant African and the polished Hindu of our own day. The\nonly method, which has been successfully employed to deliver man from\nidolatry, is that of presenting to the eye of his soul an object of\nworship perfectly holy and pure, directly opposite, in moral character, to\nthe gods he had formerly adored. He could not transfer to his deities a\nbetter character than he himself possessed. He must for ever remain\nenslaved to his idols, unless a new and pure object of worship were\nrevealed to him, with a display of superior power sufficient to overcome\nhis former faith and his present fears, to detach his affections from\ngrosser objects, and to fix them upon that which alone is worthy.(6) This\nis precisely what God, as stated in the Holy Scriptures, has done. He\nrescued one family from idolatry in the Old World, by the revelation of\nhimself to Noah; he called a distinct branch of this family to the\nknowledge of himself, in the person of Abraham and his sons; He extended\nthis favour to a whole nation, through the ministry of Moses; but it was\nthrough that of Jesus Christ alone that it was communicated to the whole\nworld. In Egypt, by the destruction of all the objects of the popular\nworship, God taught the Israelites that he alone was the self-existent\nAlmighty. At the Red Sea, he emphatically showed them that He was the\nProtector and Saviour of his people. At Sinai, he revealed himself as the\nrighteous Governor who required implicit obedience for men, and taught\nthem, by the strongly marked distinctions of the ceremonial law, that he\nwas a holy Being, of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that could not\nlook upon iniquity. The demerit of sin was inculcated by the solemn\ninfliction of death upon every animal, offered as a propitiatory\nsacrifice. And when, by this system of instruction, he had prepared a\npeople to receive the perfect revelation of the character of God, of the\nnature of his worship, and of the way of restoration to his image and\nfavour, this also was expressly revealed by the mission of his Son.(7)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8. That the books of the Old Testament, as we now have them, are\ngenuine; that they existed in the time of our Saviour, and were commonly\nreceived and referred to among the Jews, as the sacred books of their\nreligion;(8) and that the text of the Four Evangelists has been handed\ndown to us in the state in which it was originally written, that is,\nwithout having been materially corrupted or falsified, either by heretics\nor Christians; are facts which we are entitled to assume as true, until\nthe contrary is shown.\n\nThe genuineness of these writings really admits of as little doubt, and is\nsusceptible of as ready proof, as that of any ancient writings whatever.\nThe rule of municipal law on this subject is familiar, and applies with\nequal force to all ancient writing, whether documentary or otherwise; and\nas it comes first in order, in the prosecution of these inquiries, it may,\nfor the sake of mere convenience, be designated as our first rule.\n\n\n    _Every document, apparently ancient, coming from the proper\n    repository or custody, and bearing on its face no evident marks of\n    forgery, the law presumes to be genuine, and devolves on the\n    opposing party the burden of proving it to be otherwise._\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 9. An ancient document, offered in evidence in our courts, is said to\ncome from the proper repository, when it is found in the place where, and\nunder the care of persons with whom, such writings might naturally and\nreasonably be expected to be found; for it is this custody which gives\nauthenticity to documents found within it.(9) If they come from such a\nplace, and bear no evident marks of forgery, the law presumes that they\nare genuine, and they are permitted to be read in evidence, unless the\nopposing party is able successfully to impeach them.(10) The burden of\nshowing them to be false and unworthy of credit, is devolved on the party\nwho makes that objection. The presumption of law is the judgment of\ncharity. It presumes that every man is innocent until he is proven guilty;\nthat everything has been done fairly and legally, until it is proved to\nhave been otherwise; and that every document, found in its proper\nrepository, and not bearing marks of forgery, is genuine. Now this is\nprecisely the case with the Sacred Writings. They have been used in the\nchurch from time immemorial, and thus are found in the place where alone\nthey ought to be looked for. They come to us, and challenge our reception\nof them as genuine writings, precisely as Domesday Book, the Ancient\nStatutes of Wales, or any other of the ancient documents which have\nrecently been published under the British Record Commission, are received.\nThey are found in familiar use in all the churches of Christendom, as the\nsacred books to which all denominations of Christians refer, as the\nstandard of their faith. There is no pretence that they were engraven on\nplates of gold and discovered in a cave, nor that they were brought from\nheaven by angels; but they are received as the plain narratives and\nwritings of the men whose names they respectively bear, made public at the\ntime they were written; and though there are some slight discrepancies\namong the copies subsequently made, there is no pretence that the\noriginals were anywhere corrupted. If it be objected that the originals\nare lost, and that copies alone are now produced, the principles of the\nmunicipal law here also afford a satisfactory answer. For the\nmultiplication of copies was a public fact, in the faithfulness of which\nall the Christian community had an interest, and it is a rule of law,\nthat, _in matters of public and general interest, all persons must be\npresumed to be conversant, on the principle that individuals are presumed\nto be conversant with their own affairs_. Therefore it is that, in such\nmatters, the prevailing current of assertion is resorted to as evidence,\nfor it is to this that every member of the community is supposed to be\nprivy.(11) The persons, moreover, who multiplied these copies, may be\nregarded, in some manner, as the agents of the Christian public, for whose\nuse and benefit the copies were made; and on the ground of the credit due\nto such agents, and of the public nature of the facts themselves, the\ncopies thus made are entitled to an extraordinary degree of confidence,\nand, as in the case of official registers and other public books, it is\nnot necessary that they should be confirmed and sanctioned by the ordinary\ntests of truth.(12) If any ancient document concerning our public rights\nwere lost, copies which had been as universally received and acted upon as\nthe Four Gospels have been, would have been received in evidence in any of\nour courts of justice, without the slightest hesitation. The entire text\nof the Corpus Juris Civilis is received as authority in all the courts of\ncontinental Europe, upon much weaker evidence of its genuineness; for the\nintegrity of the Sacred Text has been preserved by the jealousy of\nopposing sects, beyond any moral possibility of corruption; while that of\nthe Roman Civil Law has been preserved only by tacit consent, without the\ninterest of any opposing school, to watch over and preserve it from\nalteration.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 10. These copies of the Holy Scriptures having thus been in familiar use\nin the churches, from the time when the text was committed to writing;\nhaving been watched with vigilance by so many sects, opposed to each other\nin doctrine, yet all appealing to these Scriptures for the correctness of\ntheir faith; and having in all ages, down to this day, been respected as\nthe authoritative source of all ecclesiastical power and government, and\nsubmitted to, and acted under in regard to so many claims of right, on the\none hand, and so many obligations of duty, on the other; it is quite\nerroneous to suppose that the Christian is bound to offer any further\nproof of their genuineness or authenticity. It is for the objector to show\nthem spurious; for on him, by the plainest rules of law, lies the burden\nof proof.(13) If it were the case of a claim to a franchise, and a copy of\nan ancient deed or charter were produced in support of the title, under\nparallel circumstances on which to presume its genuineness, no lawyer, it\nis believed, would venture to deny either its admissibility in evidence,\nor the satisfactory character of the proof. In a recent case in the House\nof Lords, precisely such a document, being an old manuscript copy,\npurporting to have been extracted from ancient Journals of the House,\nwhich were lost, and to have been made by an officer whose duty it was to\nprepare lists of the Peers, was held admissible in a claim of peerage.(14)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 11. Supposing, therefore, that it is not irrational, nor inconsistent\nwith sound philosophy, to believe that God has made a special and express\nrevelation of his character and will to man, and that the sacred books of\nour religion are genuine, as we now have them; we proceed to examine and\ncompare the testimony of the Four Evangelists, as witnesses to the life\nand doctrines of Jesus Christ; in order to determine the degree of credit,\nto which, by the rules of evidence applied in human tribunals, they are\njustly entitled. Our attention will naturally be first directed to the\nwitnesses themselves, to see who and what manner of men they were, and we\nshall take them in the order of their writings; stating the prominent\ntraits only in their lives and characters, as they are handed down to us\nby credible historians.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 12. MATTHEW, called also LEVI, was a Jew of Galilee, but of what city is\nuncertain. He held the place of publican, or tax-gatherer, under the Roman\ngovernment, and his office seems to have consisted in collecting the taxes\nwithin his district, as well as the duties and customs levied on goods and\npersons, passing in and out of his district or province, across the lake\nof Genesareth. While engaged in this business, at the office or usual\nplace of collection, he was required by Jesus to follow him, as one of his\ndisciples; a command which he immediately obeyed. Soon afterwards, he\nappears to have given a great entertainment to his fellow-publicans and\nfriends, at which Jesus was present; intending probably both to celebrate\nhis own change of profession, and to give them an opportunity to profit by\nthe teaching of his new Master.(15) He was constituted one of the twelve\napostles, and constantly attended the person of Jesus as a faithful\nfollower, until the crucifixion; and after the ascension of his Master he\npreached the gospel for some time, with the other apostles, in Judea, and\nafterwards in Ethiopia, where he died.\n\nHe is generally allowed to have written first, of all the evangelists; but\nwhether in the Hebrew or the Greek language, or in both, the learned are\nnot agreed, nor is it material to our purpose to inquire; the genuineness\nof our present Greek gospel being sustained by satisfactory evidence.(16)\nThe precise time when he wrote is also uncertain, the several dates given\nto it among learned men, varying from A.D. 37 to A.D. 64. The earlier\ndate, however, is argued with greater force, from the improbability that\nthe Christians would be left for several years without a general and\nauthentic history of our Saviour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ministry; from the evident allusions\nwhich it contains to a state of persecution in the church at the time it\nwas written; from the titles of sanctity ascribed to Jerusalem, and a\nhigher veneration testified for the temple than is found in the other and\nlater evangelists; from the comparative gentleness with which Herod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncharacter and conduct are dealt with, that bad prince probably being still\nin power; and from the frequent mention of Pilate, as still governor of\nJudea.(17)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 13. That Matthew was himself a native Jew, familiar with the opinions,\nceremonies, and customs of his countrymen; that he was conversant with the\nSacred Writings, and habituated to their idiom; a man of plain sense, but\nof little learning, except what he derived from the Scriptures of the Old\nTestament; that he wrote seriously and from conviction, and had, on most\noccasions, been present, and attended closely, to the transactions which\nhe relates, and relates, too, without any view of applause to himself; are\nfacts which we may consider established by internal evidence, as strong as\nthe nature of the case will admit. It is deemed equally well proved, both\nby internal evidence and the aid of history, that he wrote for the use of\nhis countrymen the Jews. Every circumstance is noticed which might\nconciliate their belief, and every unnecessary expression is avoided which\nmight obstruct it. They looked for the Messiah, of the lineage of David,\nand born in Bethlehem, in the circumstances of whose life the prophecies\nshould find fulfilment, a matter, in their estimation, of peculiar value;\nand to all these this evangelist has directed their especial\nattention.(18)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 14. Allusion has been already made to his employment as a collector of\ntaxes and customs; but the subject is too important to be passed over\nwithout further notice. The tribute imposed by the Romans upon countries\nconquered by their arms was enormous. In the time of Pompey, the sums\nannually exacted from their Asiatic provinces, of which Judea was one,\namounted to about four millions and a half sterling, or about twenty-two\nmillions of dollars. These exactions were made in the usual forms of\ndirect and indirect taxation; the rate of the customs on merchandise\nvarying from an eighth to a fortieth part of the value of the commodity;\nand the tariff including all the principal articles of the commerce of the\nEast, much of which, as is well known, still found its way to Italy\nthrough Palestine, as well as by the way of Damascus and of Egypt. The\ndirect taxes consisted of a capitation-tax and a land-tax, assessed upon a\nvaluation or census, periodically taken, under the oath of the individual,\nwith heavy penal sanctions.(19) It is natural to suppose that these taxes\nwere not voluntarily paid, especially since they were imposed by the\nconqueror upon a conquered people, and by a heathen, too, upon the people\nof the house of Israel. The increase of taxes has generally been found to\nmultiply discontents, evasions and frauds on the one hand, and, on the\nother, to increase vigilance, suspicion, close scrutiny, and severity of\nexaction. The penal code, as revised by Theodosius, will give us some\nnotion of the difficulties in the way of the revenue officers, in the\nearlier times of which we are speaking. These difficulties must have been\nincreased by the fact that, at this period, a considerable portion of the\ncommerce of that part of the world was carried on by the Greeks, whose\ningenuity and want of faith were proverbial. It was to such an employment\nand under such circumstances, that Matthew was educated; an employment\nwhich must have made him acquainted with the Greek language, and\nextensively conversant with the public affairs and the men of business of\nhis time; thus entitling him to our confidence, as an experienced and\nintelligent observer of events passing before him. And if the men of that\nday were, as in truth they appear to have been, as much disposed as those\nof the present time, to evade the payment of public taxes and duties, and\nto elude, by all possible means, the vigilance of the revenue officers,\nMatthew must have been familiar with a great variety of the forms of\nfraud, imposture, cunning, and deception, and must have become habitually\ndistrustful, scrutinizing, and cautious; and, of course, much less likely\nto have been deceived in regard to many of the facts in our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nministry, extraordinary as they were, which fell under his observation.\nThis circumstance shows both the sincerity and the wisdom of Jesus, in\nselecting him for an eye-witness of his conduct, and adds great weight to\nthe value of the testimony of this evangelist.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 15. MARK was the son of a pious sister of Barnabas, named Mary, who\ndwelt at Jerusalem, and at whose home the early Christians often\nassembled. His Hebrew name was John; the surname of Mark having been\nadopted, as is supposed, when he left Judea to preach the gospel in\nforeign countries; a practice not unusual among the Jews of that age, who\nfrequently, upon such occasions, assumed a name more familiar than their\nown to the people whom they visited. He is supposed to have been converted\nto the Christian faith by the ministry of Peter. He travelled from\nJerusalem to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, and afterwards accompanied\nthem elsewhere. When they landed at Perga in Pamphylia, he left them and\nreturned to Jerusalem; for which reason, when he afterwards would have\ngone with them, Paul refused to take him. Upon this, a difference of\nopinion arose between the two apostles, and they separated, Barnabas\ntaking Mark with him to Cyprus. Subsequently he accompanied Timothy to\nRome, at the express desire of Paul. From this city he probably went into\nAsia, where he found Peter, with whom he returned to Rome, in which city\nhe is supposed to have written and published his Gospel. Such is the\noutline of his history, as it is furnished by the New Testament.(20) The\nearly historians add, that after this he went into Egypt and planted a\nchurch in Alexandria, where he died.(21)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 16. It is agreed that Mark wrote his Gospel for the use of Gentile\nconverts; an opinion deriving great force from the explanations introduced\ninto it, which would have been useless to a Jew;(22) and that it was\ncomposed for those at Rome, is believed, not only from the numerous\nLatinisms it contains, but from the unanimous testimony of ancient\nwriters, and from the internal evidence afforded by the Gospel itself.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 17. Some have entertained the opinion that Mark compiled his account\nfrom that of Matthew, of which they supposed it an abridgment. But this\nnotion has been refuted by Koppe, and others,(23) and is now generally\nregarded as untenable. For Mark frequently deviates from Matthew in the\norder of time, in his arrangement of facts; and he adds many things not\nrelated by the other evangelists; neither of which a mere epitomizer would\nprobably have done. He also omits several things related by Matthew, and\nimperfectly describes others, especially the transactions of Christ with\nthe apostles after the resurrection; giving no account whatever of his\nappearance in Galilee; omissions irreconcilable with any previous\nknowledge of the Gospel according to Matthew. To these proofs we may add,\nthat in several places there are discrepancies between the accounts of\nMatthew and Mark, not, indeed, irreconcilable, but sufficient to destroy\nthe probability that the latter copied from the former.(24) The striking\ncoincidences between them, in style, words, and things, in other places,\nmay be accounted for by considering that Peter, who is supposed to have\ndictated this Gospel to Mark, was quite as intimately acquainted as\nMatthew with the miracles and discourses of our Lord; which, therefore, he\nwould naturally recite in his preaching; and that the same things might\nvery naturally be related in the same manner, by men who sought not after\nexcellency of speech. Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agency in the narrative of Mark is asserted\nby all ancient writers, and is confirmed by the fact, that his humility is\nconspicuous in every part of it, where anything is or might be related of\nhim; his weaknesses and fall being fully exposed, while things which might\nredound to his honour, are either omitted or but slightly mentioned; that\nscarcely any transaction of Jesus is related, at which Peter was not\npresent, and that all are related with that circumstantial minuteness\nwhich belongs to the testimony of an eye-witness.(25) We may, therefore,\nregard the Gospel of Mark as an original composition, written at the\ndictation of Peter, and consequently as another original narrative of the\nlife, miracles, and doctrines of our Lord.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 18. LUKE, according to Eusebius, was a native of Antioch, by profession\na physician, and for a considerable period a companion of the apostle\nPaul. From the casual notices of him in the Scriptures, and from the early\nChristian writers, it has been collected, that his parents were Gentiles,\nbut that he in his youth embraced Judaism, from which he was converted to\nChristianity. The first mention of him is that he was with Paul at\nTroas;(26) whence he appears to have attended him to Jerusalem; continued\nwith him in all his troubles in Judea; and sailed with him when he was\nsent a prisoner from C\u00c3\u00a6sarea to Rome, where he remained with him during\nhis two years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 confinement. As none of the ancient fathers have mentioned\nhis having suffered martyrdom, it is generally supposed that he died a\nnatural death.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 19. That he wrote his Gospel for the benefit of Gentile converts is\naffirmed by the unanimous voice of Christian antiquity; and it may also be\ninferred from its dedication to a Gentile. He is particularly careful to\nspecify various circumstances conducive to the information of strangers,\nbut not so to the Jews; he gives the lineage of Jesus upwards, after the\nmanner of the Gentiles, instead of downwards, as Matthew had done; tracing\nit up to Adam, and thus showing that Jesus was the promised seed of the\nwoman; and he marks the eras of his birth, and of the ministry of John, by\nthe reigns of the Roman emperors. He also has introduced several things,\nnot mentioned by the other evangelists, but highly encouraging to the\nGentiles to turn to God in the hope of pardon and acceptance; of which\ndescription are the parables of the publican and pharisee, in the temple;\nthe lost piece of silver; and the prodigal son; and the fact of Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nvisit to Zaccheus the publican, and the pardon of the penitent thief.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 20. That Luke was a physician, appears not only from the testimony of\nPaul,(27) but from the internal marks in his Gospel, showing that he was\nboth an acute observer, and had given particular and even professional\nattention to all our Saviour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s miracles of healing. Thus, the man whom\nMatthew and Mark describe simply as a leper, Luke describes as _full_ of\nleprosy;(28) he, whom they mention as having a withered hand, Luke says\nhad his _right_ hand withered;(29) and of the maid, of whom the others say\nthat Jesus took her by the hand and she arose, he adds, that _her spirit\ncame to her again_.(30) He alone, with professional accuracy of\nobservation, says that _virtue went out_ of Jesus, and healed the\nsick;(31) he alone states the fact that the sleep of the disciples in\nGethsemane was _induced by extreme sorrow_; and mentions the blood-like\nsweat of Jesus, as occasioned by the _intensity of his agony_; and he\nalone relates the miraculous healing of Malchus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ear.(32) That he was\nalso a man of a liberal education, the comparative elegance of his\nwritings sufficiently show.(33)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 21. The design of Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gospel was to supersede the defective and\ninaccurate narratives then in circulation, and to deliver to Theophilus,\nto whom it is addressed, a full and authentic account of the life,\ndoctrines, miracles, death and resurrection of our Saviour. Who Theophilus\nwas, the learned are not perfectly agreed; but the most probable opinion\nis that of Dr. Lardner, now generally adopted, that, as Luke wrote his\nGospel in Greece, Theophilus was a man of rank in that country.(34) Either\nthe relations subsisting between him and Luke, or the dignity and power of\nhis rank, or both, induced the evangelist, who himself also \u00e2\u0080\u009chad perfect\nunderstanding of all things from the first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to devote the utmost care to\nthe drawing up of a complete and authentic narrative of these great\nevents. He does not affirm himself to have been an eye-witness; though his\npersonal knowledge of some of the transactions may well be inferred from\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009cperfect understanding\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he says he possessed. Some of the\nlearned seem to have drawn this inference as to them all, and to have\nplaced him in the class of original witnesses; but this opinion, though\nmaintained on strong and plausible grounds, is not generally adopted. If,\nthen, he did not write from his own personal knowledge, the question is,\nwhat is the legal character of his testimony?\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 22. If it were \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe result of inquiries, made under competent public\nauthority, concerning matters in which the public are concerned\u00e2\u0080\u009d(35) it\nwould possess every legal attribute of an inquisition, and, as such, would\nbe legally admissible in evidence, in a court of justice. To entitle such\nresults, however, to our full confidence, it is not necessary that they\nshould be obtained under a legal commission; it is sufficient if the\ninquiry is gravely undertaken and pursued, by a person of competent\nintelligence, sagacity and integrity. The request of a person in\nauthority, or a desire to serve the public, are, to all moral intents, as\nsufficient a motive as a legal commission.(36) Thus, we know that when\ncomplaint is made to the head of a department, of official misconduct or\nabuse, existing in some remote quarter, nothing is more common than to\nsend some confidential person to the spot, to ascertain the facts and\nreport them to the department; and this report is confidently adopted as\nthe basis of its discretionary action, in the correction of the abuse, or\nthe removal of the offender. Indeed, the result of any grave inquiry is\nequally certain to receive our confidence, though it may have been\nvoluntarily undertaken, if the party making it had access to the means of\ncomplete and satisfactory information upon the subject.(37) If, therefore,\nLuke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Gospel were to be regarded only as the work of a contemporary\nhistorian, it would be entitled to our confidence. But it is more than\nthis. It is the result of careful inquiry and examination, made by a\nperson of science, intelligence and education, concerning subjects which\nhe was perfectly competent to investigate, and as to many of which he was\npeculiarly skilled, they being cases of the cure of maladies; subjects,\ntoo, of which he already had the perfect knowledge of a contemporary, and\nperhaps an eye-witness, but beyond doubt, familiar with the parties\nconcerned in the transactions, and belonging to the community in which the\nevents transpired, which were in the mouths of all; and the narrative,\nmoreover, drawn up for the especial use, and probably at the request, of a\nman of distinction, whom it would not be for the interest nor safety of\nthe writer to deceive or mislead. Such a document certainly possesses all\nthe moral attributes of an inquest of office, or of any other official\ninvestigation of facts; and as such is entitled, _in foro conscienti\u00c3\u00a6_, to\nbe adduced as original, competent and satisfactory evidence of the matters\nit contains.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 23. JOHN, the last of the evangelists, was the son of Zebedee, a\nfisherman of the town of Bethsaida, on the sea of Galilee. His father\nappears to have been a respectable man in his calling, owning his vessel\nand having hired servants.(38) His mother, too, was among those who\nfollowed Jesus and \u00e2\u0080\u009cministered unto him(39);\u00e2\u0080\u009d and to John himself, Jesus,\nwhen on the cross, confided the care and support of his own mother.(40)\nThis disciple also seems to have been favourably known to the high priest,\nand to have influence in his family; by means of which he had the\nprivilege of being present in his palace at the examination of his Master,\nand of introducing also Peter, his friend.(41) He was the youngest of the\napostles, was eminently the object of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regard and confidence;\nwas on various occasions admitted to free and intimate intercourse with\nhim; and is described as \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe disciple whom Jesus loved.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(42) Hence he was\npresent at several scenes, to which most of the others were not admitted.\nHe alone, in company with Peter and James, was present at the resurrection\nof Jairus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter, at the transfiguration on the mount, and at the\nagony of our Saviour in the garden of Gethsemane.(43) He was the only\napostle who followed Jesus to the cross, he was the first of them at the\nsepulchre, and he was present at the several appearances of our Lord after\nhis resurrection. These circumstances, together with his intimate\nfriendship with the mother of Jesus, especially qualify him to give a\ncircumstantial and authentic account of the life of his Master. After the\nascension of Christ, and the effusion of the Holy Spirit on the day of\nPentecost, John became one of the chief apostles of the circumcision,\nexercising his ministry in and near Jerusalem. From ecclesiastical history\nwe learn that, after the death of Mary the mother of Jesus, he proceeded\nto Asia Minor, where he founded and presided over seven churches, in as\nmany cities, but resided chiefly at Ephesus. Thence he was banished, in\nDomitian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reign, to the isle of Patmos, where he wrote his Revelation. On\nthe accession of Nerva he was freed from exile, and returned to Ephesus,\nwhere he wrote his Gospel and Epistles, and died at the age of one hundred\nyears, about A.D. 100, in the third year of the emperor Trajan.(44)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 24. The learned are not agreed as to the time when the Gospel of John\nwas written, some dating it as early as the year 68, others as late as the\nyear 98; but it is generally conceded to have been written after all the\nothers. That it could not have been the work of some Platonic Christian of\na subsequent age, as some have without evidence asserted, is manifest from\nreferences to it by some of the early fathers, and from the concurring\ntestimony of many other writers of the ancient Christian church.(45)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 25. That it was written either with especial reference to the Gentiles,\nor at a period when very many of them had become converts to Christianity,\nis inferred from the various explanations it contains, beyond the other\nGospels, which could have been necessary only to persons unacquainted with\nJewish names and customs.(46) And that it was written after all the\nothers, and to supply their omissions, is concluded, not only from the\nuniform tradition and belief in the church, but from his studied omission\nof most of the transactions noticed by the others, and from his care to\nmention several incidents which they have not recorded. That their\nnarratives were known to him, is too evident to admit of doubt; while his\nomission to repeat what they had already stated, or, where he does mention\nthe same things, his relating them in a brief and cursory manner, affords\nincidental but strong testimony that he regarded their accounts as\nfaithful and true.(47)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 26. Such are the brief histories of the men, whose narratives we are to\nexamine and compare; conducting the examination and weighing the testimony\nby the same rules and principles which govern our tribunals of justice in\nsimilar cases. These tribunals are in such cases governed by the following\nfundamental rule:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n    _In trials of fact, by oral testimony, the proper inquiry is not\n    whether it is possible that the testimony may be false, but\n    whether there is sufficient probability that it is true._\n\n\nIt should be observed that the subject of inquiry is matter of fact, and\nnot of abstract mathematical truth. The latter alone is susceptible of\nthat high degree of proof, usually termed demonstration, which excludes\nthe possibility of error, and which therefore may reasonably be required\nin support of every mathematical deduction. But the proof of matters of\nfact rests upon moral evidence alone; by which is meant not merely that\nspecies of evidence which is employed in cases respecting moral conduct,\nbut all the evidence which we do not obtain either from our own senses,\nfrom intuition, or from demonstration. In the ordinary affairs of life we\ndo not require nor expect demonstrative evidence, because it is\ninconsistent with the nature of matters of fact, and to insist on its\nproduction would be unreasonable and absurd. And it makes no difference,\nwhether the facts to be proved relate to this life or to the next, the\nnature of the evidence required being in both cases the same. The error of\nthe sceptic consists in pretending or supposing that there is a difference\nin the nature of the evidence, where there is no difference in the nature\nof the things to be proved; and in demanding demonstrative evidence\nconcerning things which are not susceptible of any other than moral\nevidence alone, and of which the utmost that can be said is that there is\nno reasonable doubt of their truth.(48)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 27. In proceeding to weigh the evidence of any proposition of fact, the\nprevious question to be determined is, _when_ may it be said to be proved?\nThe answer to this question is furnished by another rule of municipal law,\nwhich may be thus stated:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\n    _A proposition of fact is proved, when its truth is established by\n    competent and satisfactory evidence._\n\n\nBy competent evidence, is meant such as the nature of the thing to be\nproved requires; and by satisfactory evidence, is meant that amount of\nproof, which ordinarily satisfies an unprejudiced mind, beyond any\nreasonable doubt. The circumstances which will amount to this degree of\nproof can never be previously defined; the only legal test to which they\ncan be subjected is, their sufficiency to satisfy the mind and conscience\nof a man of common prudence and discretion, and so to convince him, that\nhe would venture to act upon that conviction in matters of the highest\nconcern and importance to his own interest.(49) If, therefore, the subject\nis a problem in mathematics, its truth is to be shown by the certainty of\ndemonstrative evidence. But if it is a question of fact in human affairs,\nnothing more than moral evidence can be required, for this is the best\nevidence which, from the nature of the case, is attainable. Now as the\nfacts, stated in Scripture History, are not of the former kind, but are\ncognizable by the senses, they may be said to be proved when they are\nestablished by that kind and degree of evidence which, as we have just\nobserved, would, in the affairs of human life, satisfy the mind and\nconscience of a common man. When we have this degree of evidence, it is\nunreasonable to require more. A juror would violate his oath, if he should\nrefuse to acquit or condemn a person charged with an offence, where this\nmeasure of proof was adduced.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 28. Proceeding further, to inquire whether the facts related by the Four\nEvangelists are proved by competent and satisfactory evidence, we are led,\nfirst, to consider on which side lies the burden of establishing the\ncredibility of the witnesses. On this point the municipal law furnishes a\nrule, which is of constant application in all trials by jury, and is\nindeed the dictate of that charity which thinketh no evil.\n\n\n    _In the absence of circumstances which generate suspicion, every\n    witness is to be presumed credible, until the contrary is shown;\n    the burden of impeaching his credibility lying on the\n    objector._(_50_)\n\n\nThis rule serves to show the injustice with which the writers of the\nGospels have ever been treated by infidels; an injustice silently\nacquiesced in even by Christians; in requiring the Christian\naffirmatively, and by positive evidence, _aliunde_, to establish the\ncredibility of his witnesses above all others, before their testimony is\nentitled to be considered, and in permitting the testimony of a single\nprofane writer, alone and uncorroborated, to outweigh that of any single\nChristian. This is not the course in courts of chancery, where the\ntestimony of a single witness is never permitted to outweigh the oath even\nof the defendant himself, interested as he is in the cause; but, on the\ncontrary, if the plaintiff, after having required the oath of his\nadversary, cannot overthrow it by something more than the oath of one\nwitness, however credible, it must stand as evidence against him. But the\nChristian writer seems, by the usual course of the argument, to have been\ndeprived of the common presumption of charity in his favour; and reversing\nthe ordinary rule of administering justice in human tribunals, his\ntestimony is unjustly presumed to be false, until it is proved to be true.\nThis treatment moreover, has been applied to them all in a body; and,\nwithout due regard to the fact, that, being independent historians,\nwriting at different periods, they are entitled to the support of each\nother: they have been treated, in the argument, almost as if the New\nTestament were the entire production, at once, of a body of men,\nconspiring by a joint fabrication, to impose a false religion upon the\nworld. It is time that this injustice should cease, that the testimony of\nthe evangelists should be admitted to be true, until it can be disproved\nby those who would impugn it; that the silence of one sacred writer on any\npoint, should no more detract from his own veracity or that of the other\nhistorians, than the like circumstance is permitted to do among profane\nwriters; and that the Four Evangelists should be admitted in corroboration\nof each other, as readily as Josephus and Tacitus, or Polybius and\nLivy.(51)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 29. But if the burden of establishing the credibility of the evangelists\nwere devolved on those who affirm the truth of their narratives, it is\nstill capable of a ready moral demonstration, when we consider the nature\nand character of the testimony, and the essential marks of difference\nbetween true narratives of facts and the creations of falsehood. It is\nuniversally admitted that the credit to be given to witnesses depends\nchiefly on their ability to discern and comprehend what was before them,\ntheir opportunities for observation, the degree of accuracy with which\nthey are accustomed to mark passing events, and their integrity in\nrelating them. The rule of municipal law on this subject embraces all\nthese particulars, and is thus stated by a legal text-writer of the\nhighest repute.\n\n\n    _The credit due to the testimony of witnesses depends upon,\n    firstly, their honesty; secondly, their ability; thirdly, their\n    number and the consistency of their testimony; fourthly, the\n    conformity of their testimony with experience; and fifthly, the\n    coincidence of their testimony with collateral circumstances._(52)\n\n\nLet the evangelists be tried by these tests.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 30. And _first_, as to their _honesty_. Here they are entitled to the\nbenefit of the general course of human experience, that men ordinarily\nspeak the truth, when they have no prevailing motive or inducement to the\ncontrary. This presumption, to which we have before alluded, is applied in\ncourts of justice, even to witnesses whose integrity is not wholly free\nfrom suspicion; much more is it applicable to the evangelists, whose\ntestimony went against all their worldly interests. The great truths which\nthe apostles declared, were, that Christ had risen from the dead, and that\nonly through repentance from sin, and faith in him, could men hope for\nsalvation. This doctrine they asserted with one voice, everywhere, not\nonly under the greatest discouragements, but in the face of the most\nappalling terrors that can be presented to the mind of man. Their master\nhad recently perished as a malefactor, by the sentence of a public\ntribunal. His religion sought to overthrow the religions of the whole\nworld. The laws of every country were against the teachings of his\ndisciples. The interests and passions of all the rulers and great men in\nthe world were against them. The fashion of the world was against them.\nPropagating this new faith, even in the most inoffensive and peaceful\nmanner, they could expect nothing but contempt, opposition, revilings,\nbitter persecutions, stripes, imprisonments, torments and cruel deaths.\nYet this faith they zealously did propagate; and all these miseries they\nendured undismayed, nay, rejoicing. As one after another was put to a\nmiserable death, the survivors only prosecuted their work with increased\nvigour and resolution. The annals of military warfare afford scarcely an\nexample of the like heroic constancy, patience and unblenching courage.\nThey had every possible motive to review carefully the grounds of their\nfaith, and the evidences of the great facts and truths which they\nasserted; and these motives were pressed upon their attention with the\nmost melancholy and terrific frequency. It was therefore impossible that\nthey could have persisted in affirming the truths they have narrated, had\nnot Jesus actually risen from the dead, and had they not known this fact\nas certainly as they knew any other fact.(53) If it were morally possible\nfor them to have been deceived in this matter, every human motive operated\nto lead them to discover and avow their error. To have persisted in so\ngross a falsehood, after it was known to them, was not only to encounter,\nfor life, all the evils which man could inflict, from without, but to\nendure also the pangs of inward and conscious guilt, with no hope of\nfuture peace, no testimony of a good conscience, no expectation of honour\nor esteem among men, no hope of happiness in this life, or in the world to\ncome.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 31. Such conduct in the apostles would moreover have been utterly\nirreconcilable with the fact, that they possessed the ordinary\nconstitution of our common nature. Yet their lives do show them to have\nbeen men like all others of our race; swayed by the same motives, animated\nby the same hopes, affected by the same joys, subdued by the same sorrows,\nagitated by the same fears, and subject to the same passions, temptations\nand infirmities, as ourselves. And their writings show them to have been\nmen of vigorous understandings. If then their testimony was not true,\nthere was no possible motive for its fabrication.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 32. It would also have been irreconcilable with the fact that they were\ngood men. But it is impossible to read their writings, and not feel that\nwe are conversing with men eminently holy, and of tender consciences, with\nmen acting under an abiding sense of the presence and omniscience of God,\nand of their accountability to him, living in his fear, and walking in his\nways. Now, though, in a single instance, a good man may fall, when under\nstrong temptations, yet he is not found persisting, for years, in\ndeliberate falsehood, asserted with the most solemn appeals to God,\nwithout the slightest temptation or motive, and against all the opposing\ninterests which reign in the human breast. If, on the contrary, they are\nsupposed to have been bad men, it is incredible that such men should have\nchosen this form of imposture; enjoining, as it does, unfeigned\nrepentance, the utter forsaking and abhorrence of all falsehood and of\nevery other sin, the practice of daily self-denial, self-abasement and\nself-sacrifice, the crucifixion of the flesh with all its earthly\nappetites and desires, indifference to the honours, and hearty contempt of\nthe vanities of the world; and inculcating perfect purity of heart and\nlife, and intercourse of the soul with heaven. It is incredible, that bad\nmen should invent falsehoods, to promote the religion of the God of truth.\nThe supposition is suicidal. If they did believe in a future state of\nretribution, a heaven and a hell hereafter, they took the most certain\ncourse, if false witnesses, to secure the latter for their portion. And\nif, still being bad men, they did not believe in future punishment, how\ncame they to invent falsehoods, the direct and certain tendency of which\nwas to destroy all their prospects of worldly honour and happiness, and to\nensure their misery in this life? From these absurdities there is no\nescape, but in the perfect conviction and admission that they were good\nmen, testifying to that which they had carefully observed and considered,\nand well knew to be true.(54)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 33. In the _second_ place, as to their _ability_. The text writer before\ncited observes, that the ability of a witness to speak the truth, depends\non the opportunities which he has had for observing the fact, the accuracy\nof his powers of discerning, and the faithfulness of his memory in\nretaining the facts, once observed and known.(55) Of the latter trait, in\nthese witnesses, we of course know nothing; nor have we any traditionary\ninformation in regard to the accuracy of their powers of discerning. But\nwe may well suppose that in these respects they were like the generality\nof their countrymen, until the contrary is shown by an objector. It is\nalways to be presumed that men are honest, and of sound mind, and of the\naverage and ordinary degree of intelligence. This is not the judgment of\nmere charity; it is also the uniform presumption of the law of the land; a\npresumption which is always allowed freely and fully to operate, until the\nfact is shown to be otherwise, by the party who denies the applicability\nof this presumption to the particular case in question. Whenever an\nobjection is raised in opposition to the ordinary presumptions of law, or\nto the ordinary experience of mankind, the burden of proof is devolved on\nthe objector, by the common and ordinary rules of evidence, and of\npractice in courts. No lawyer is permitted to argue in disparagement of\nthe intelligence or integrity of a witness, against whom the case itself\nafforded no particle of testimony. This is sufficient for our purpose, in\nregard to these witnesses. But more than this is evident, from the\nminuteness of their narratives, and from their history. Matthew was\ntrained, by his calling, to habits of severe investigation and suspicious\nscrutiny; and Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profession demanded an exactness of observation\nequally close and searching. The other two evangelists, it has been well\nremarked, were as much too unlearned to forge the story of their Master\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlife, as these were too learned and acute to be deceived by imposture.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 34. In the _third_ place, as to their _number_ and the _consistency_ of\ntheir testimony. The character of their narratives is like that of all\nother true witnesses, containing, as Dr. Paley observes, substantial\ntruth, under circumstantial variety. There is enough of discrepancy to\nshow that there could have been no previous concert among them; and at the\nsame time such substantial agreement as to show that they all were\nindependent narrators of the same great transaction, as the events\nactually occurred. That they conspired to impose falsehood upon the world\nis, moreover, utterly inconsistent with the supposition that they were\nhonest men; a fact, to the proofs of which we have already adverted. But\nif they were bad men, still the idea of any conspiracy among them is\nnegatived, not only by the discrepancies alluded to, but by many other\ncircumstances which will be mentioned hereafter; from all which, it is\nmanifest that if they concerted a false story, they sought its\naccomplishment by a mode quite the opposite to that which all others are\nfound to pursue, to attain the same end. On this point the profound remark\nof an eminent writer is to our purpose; that \u00e2\u0080\u009cin a number of concurrent\ntestimonies, where there has been no previous concert, there is a\nprobability distinct from that which may be termed the sum of the\nprobabilities resulting from the testimonies of the witnesses, a\nprobability which would remain, even though the witnesses were of such a\ncharacter as to merit no faith at all. This probability arises from the\nconcurrence itself. That such a concurrence should spring from chance, is\nas one to infinite; that is, in other words, morally impossible. If\ntherefore concert be excluded, there remains no cause but the reality of\nthe fact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(56)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 35. The discrepancies between the narratives of the several evangelists,\nwhen carefully examined, will not be found sufficient to invalidate their\ntestimony. Many seeming contradictions will prove, upon closer scrutiny,\nto be in substantial agreement; and it may be confidently asserted that\nthere are none that will not yield, under fair and just criticism. If\nthese different accounts of the same transactions were in strict verbal\nconformity with each other, the argument against their credibility would\nbe much stronger. All that is asked for these witnesses is, that their\ntestimony may be regarded as we regard the testimony of men in the\nordinary affairs of life. This they are justly entitled to; and this no\nhonourable adversary can refuse. We might, indeed, take higher ground than\nthis, and confidently claim for them the severest scrutiny; but our\npresent purpose is merely to try their veracity by the ordinary tests of\ntruth, admitted in human tribunals.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 36. If the evidence of the evangelists is to be rejected because of a\nfew discrepancies among them, we shall be obliged to discard that of many\nof the contemporaneous histories on which we are accustomed to rely. Dr.\nPaley has noticed the contradiction between Lord Clarendon and Burnett and\nothers in regard to Lord Strafford\u00e2\u0080\u0099s execution; the former stating that he\nwas condemned to be hanged, which was done on the same day; and the latter\nall relating that on a Saturday he was sentenced to the block, and was\nbeheaded on the following Monday. Another striking instance of discrepancy\nhas since occurred, in the narratives of the different members of the\nroyal family of France, of their flight from Paris to Varennes, in 1792.\nThese narratives, ten in number, and by eye-witnesses and personal actors\nin the transactions they relate, contradict each other, some on trivial\nand some on more essential points, but in every case in a wonderful and\ninexplicable manner.(57) Yet these contradictions do not, in the general\npublic estimation, detract from the integrity of the narrators, nor from\nthe credibility of their relations. In the points in which they agree, and\nwhich constitute the great body of their narratives, their testimony is of\ncourse not doubted; where they differ, we reconcile them as well as we\nmay; and where this cannot be done at all, we follow that light which\nseems to us the clearest. Upon the principles of the sceptic, we should be\nbound utterly to disbelieve them all. On the contrary, we apply to such\ncases the rules which, in daily experience, our judges instruct juries to\napply, in weighing and reconciling the testimony of different witnesses;\nand which the courts themselves observe, in comparing and reconciling\ndifferent and sometimes discordant reports of the same decisions. This\nremark applies especially to some alleged discrepancies in the reports\nwhich the several evangelists have given of the same discourses of our\nLord.(58)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 37. In the _fourth_ place, as to the _conformity of their testimony with\nexperience_. The title of the evangelists to full credit for veracity\nwould be readily conceded by the objector, if the facts they relate were\nsuch as ordinarily occur in human experience. But they also relate events\nwhich were miraculous, or out of the ordinary course of human experience,\nand on this circumstance an argument is founded against their credibility.\nMiracles, say the objectors, are impossible; and therefore the evangelists\nwere either deceivers or deceived; and in either case their narratives are\nunworthy of belief. Spinosa\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument against the possibility of\nmiracles, was founded on the broad and bold assumption that all things are\ngoverned by immutable laws, or fixed modes of motion and relation, termed\nthe laws of nature, by which God himself is of necessity bound. This\nerroneous assumption is the tortoise, on which stands the elephant that\nupholds his system of atheism. He does not inform us who made these\nimmutable laws, nor whence they derive their binding force and\nirresistible operation. The argument supposes that the creator of all\nthings first made a code of laws, and then put it out of his own power to\nchange them. The scheme of Mr. Hume is but another form of the same error.\nHe deduces the existence of such immutable laws from the uniform course of\nhuman experience. This, he affirms, is our only guide in reasoning\nconcerning matters of fact; and whatever is contrary to human experience,\nhe pronounces incredible.(59) Without stopping to examine the correctness\nof this doctrine, as a fundamental principle in the law of evidence, it is\nsufficient in this place to remark, that is contains this fallacy; it\nexcludes all knowledge derived by inference or deduction from facts,\nconfining us to what we derive from experience alone, and thus depriving\nus of any knowledge, or even rational belief, of the existence or\ncharacter of God. Nay more, it goes to prove that successive generations\nof men can make no advancement in knowledge, but each must begin _de\nnovo_, and be limited to the results of its own experience. But if we may\ninfer, from what we see and know, that there is a Supreme Being, by whom\nthis world was created, we may certainly, and with equal reason, believe\nhim capable of works which _we_ have never yet known him to perform. We\nmay fairly conclude that the power which was originally put forth to\ncreate the world is still constantly and without ceasing exerted to\nsustain it; and that the experienced connexion between cause and effect is\nbut the uniform and constantly active operation of the finger of God.\nWhether this uniformity of operation extends to things beyond the limits\nof our observation, is a point we cannot certainly know. Its existence in\nall things that ordinarily concern us may be supposed to be ordained as\nconducive to our happiness; and if the belief in a revelation of peace and\nmercy from God is conducive to the happiness of man, it is not irrational\nto suppose that he would depart from his ordinary course of action, in\norder to give it such attestations as should tend to secure that belief.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA miracle is improbable, when we can perceive no sufficient cause, in\nreference to his creatures, why the Deity should vary his modes of\noperation; it ceases to be so, when such cause is assigned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(60)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 38. But the full discussion of the subject of miracles forms no part of\nthe present design. Their credibility has been fully established, and the\nobjections of sceptics most satisfactorily met and overthrown, by the\nablest writers of our own day, whose works are easily accessible.(61) Thus\nmuch, however, may here be remarked; that in almost every miracle related\nby the evangelists, the facts, separately taken, were plain, intelligible,\ntranspiring in public, and about which no person of ordinary observation\nwould be likely to mistake. Persons blind or crippled, who applied to\nJesus for relief, were known to have been crippled or blind for many\nyears; they came to be cured; he spake to them; they went away whole.\nLazarus had been dead and buried four days; Jesus called him to come forth\nfrom the grave; he immediately came forth, and was seen alive for a long\ntime afterwards. In every case of healing, the previous condition of the\nsufferer was known to all; all saw his instantaneous restoration, and all\nwitnessed the act of Jesus in touching him, and heard his words.(62) All\nthese, separately considered, were facts, plain and simple in their\nnature, easily seen and fully comprehended by persons of common capacity\nand observation. If they were separately testified to, by different\nwitnesses of ordinary intelligence and integrity, in any court of justice,\nthe jury would be bound to believe them; and a verdict, rendered contrary\nto the uncontradicted testimony of credible witnesses to any one of these\nplain facts, separately taken, would be liable to be set aside, as a\nverdict against evidence. If one credible witness testified to the fact,\nthat Bartimeus was blind, according to the uniform course of administering\njustice, this fact would be taken as satisfactorily proved. So also, if\nhis subsequent restoration to sight were the sole fact in question, this\nalso would be deemed established, by the like evidence. Nor would the rule\nof evidence be at all different, if the fact to be proved were the\ndeclaration of Jesus, immediately preceding his restoration to sight, that\nhis faith had made him whole. In each of these cases, each isolated fact\nwas capable of being accurately observed, and certainly known; and the\nevidence demands our assent, precisely as the like evidence upon any other\nindifferent subject. The connexion of the word or the act of Jesus with\nthe restoration of the blind, lame and dead, to sight, and health, and\nlife, as cause and effect, is a conclusion which our reason is compelled\nto admit, from the uniformity of their concurrence, in such a multitude of\ninstances, as well as from the universal conviction of all, whether\nfriends or foes, who beheld the miracles which he wrought. Indeed, if the\ntruth of one of the miracles is satisfactorily established, our belief\ncannot reasonably be withheld from them all. This is the issue proposed by\nDr. Paley, in regard to the evidence of the death of Jesus upon the cross,\nand his subsequent resurrection, the truth of which he has established in\nan argument, incapable of refutation.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 39. In the _fifth_ place, as to _the coincidence of their testimony with\ncollateral and contemporaneous facts and circumstances_. After a witness\nis dead, and his moral character is forgotten, we can ascertain it only by\na close inspection of his narrative, comparing its details with each\nother, and with contemporary accounts and collateral facts. This test is\nmuch more accurate than may at first be supposed. Every event which\nactually transpires, has its appropriate relation and place in the vast\ncomplication of circumstances, of which the affairs of men consist; it\nowes its origin to the events which have preceded it, is intimately\nconnected with all others which occur at the same time and place, and\noften with those of remote regions, and in its turn gives birth to\nnumberless others which succeed. In all this almost inconceivable\ncontexture, and seeming discord, there is perfect harmony; and while the\nfact, which really happened, tallies exactly with every other\ncontemporaneous incident, related to it in the remotest degree, it is not\npossible for the wit of man to invent a story, which, if closely compared\nwith the actual occurrences of the same time and place, may not be shown\nto be false.(63) Hence it is, that a false witness will not willingly\ndetail any circumstances, in which his testimony will be open to\ncontradiction, nor multiply them where there is danger of his being\ndetected by a comparison of them with other accounts, equally\ncircumstantial. He will rather deal in general statements and broad\nassertions, and if he finds it necessary for his purpose to employ names\nand particular circumstances in his story, he will endeavor to invent such\nas shall be out of the reach of all opposing proof; and will be the most\nforward and minute in details, where he knows that any danger of\ncontradiction is least to be apprehended.(64) Therefore it is, that\nvariety and minuteness of detail are usually regarded as certain tests of\nsincerity, if the story, in the circumstances related, is of a nature\ncapable of easy refutation if it were false.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 40. The difference, in the detail of circumstances, between artful or\nfalse witnesses and those who testify the truth, is worthy of especial\nobservation. The former are often copious and even profuse in their\nstatements, as far as these may have been previously fabricated, and in\nrelation to the principal matter; but beyond this, all will be reserved\nand meagre, from the fear of detection. Every lawyer knows how lightly the\nevidence of a _non-mi-recordo_ witness is esteemed. The testimony of false\nwitnesses will not be uniform in its texture, but will be unequal,\nunnatural, and inconsistent. On the contrary, in the testimony of true\nwitnesses there is a visible and striking naturalness of manner, and an\nunaffected readiness and copiousness in the detail of circumstances, as\nwell in one part of the narrative as another, and evidently without the\nleast regard either to the facility or difficulty of verification or\ndetection.(65) It is easier, therefore, to make out the proof of any fact,\nif proof it may be called, by suborning one or more false witnesses, to\ntestify directly to the matter in question, than to procure an equal\nnumber to testify falsely to such collateral and separate circumstances as\nwill, without greater danger of detection, lead to the same false result.\nThe increased number of witnesses to circumstances, and the increased\nnumber of the circumstances themselves, all tend to increase the\nprobability of detection if the witnesses are false, because thereby the\npoints are multiplied in which their statements may be compared with each\nother, as well as with the truth itself, and in the same proportion is\nincreased the danger of variance and inconsistency.(66) Thus the force of\ncircumstantial evidence is found to depend on the number of particulars\ninvolved in the narrative; the difficulty of fabricating them all, if\nfalse, and the great facility of detection; the nature of the\ncircumstances to be compared, and from which the dates and other facts are\nto be collected; the intricacy of the comparison; the number of the\nintermediate steps in the process of deduction; and the circuity of the\ninvestigation. The more largely the narrative partakes of these\ncharacters, the further it will be found removed from all suspicion of\ncontrivance or design, and the more profoundly the mind will repose on the\nconviction of its truth.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 41. The narratives of the sacred writers, both Jewish and Christian,\nabound in examples of this kind of evidence, the value of which is hardly\ncapable of being properly estimated. It does not, as has been already\nremarked, amount to mathematical demonstration; nor is this degree of\nproof justly demandable in any question of moral conduct. In all human\ntransactions, the highest degree of assurance to which we can arrive,\nshort of the evidence of our own senses, is that of probability. The most\nthat can be asserted is, that the narrative is more likely to be true than\nfalse; and it may be in the highest degree more likely, but still be short\nof absolute mathematical certainty. Yet this very probability may be so\ngreat as to satisfy the mind of the most cautious, and enforce the assent\nof the most reluctant and unbelieving. If it is such as usually satisfies\nreasonable men, in matters of ordinary transaction, it is all which the\ngreatest sceptic has a right to require; for it is by such evidence alone\nthat our rights are determined, in the civil tribunals; and on no other\nevidence do they proceed, even in capital cases. Thus, where a house had\nbeen feloniously broken open with a knife, the blade of which was broken\nand left in the window, and the mutilated knife itself, the parts\nperfectly agreeing, was found in the pocket of the accused, who gave no\nsatisfactory explanation of the fact, no reasonable doubt remained of his\nparticipation in the crime. And where a murder had been committed by\nshooting with a pistol, and the prisoner was connected with the\ntransaction by proof that the wadding of the pistol was part of a letter\naddressed to him, the remainder of which was found upon his person, no\njuror\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conscience could have reproached him for assenting to the verdict\nof condemnation.(67) Yet the evidence, in both cases, is but the evidence\nof circumstances; amounting, it is true, to the highest degree of\nprobability, but yet not utterly inconsistent with the innocence of the\naccused. The evidence which we have of the great facts of the Bible\nhistory belongs to this class, that is, it is moral evidence; sufficient\nto satisfy any rational mind, by carrying it to the highest degree of\nmoral certainty. If such evidence will justify the taking away of human\nlife or liberty, in the one case, surely it ought to be deemed sufficient\nto determine our faith in the other.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 42. All that Christianity asks of men on this subject, is, that they\nwould be consistent with themselves; that they would treat its evidences\nas they treat the evidence of other things; and that they would try and\njudge its actors and witnesses, as they deal with their fellow-men, when\ntestifying to human affairs and actions, in human tribunals. Let the\nwitnesses be compared with themselves, with each other, and with\nsurrounding facts and circumstances; and let their testimony be sifted, as\nif it were given in a court of justice, on the side of the adverse party,\nthe witnesses being subjected to a rigorous cross-examination. The result,\nit is confidently believed, will be an undoubting conviction of their\nintegrity, ability, and truth. In the course of such an examination, the\nundesigned coincidences will multiply upon us at every step in our\nprogress; the probability of the veracity of the witnesses and of the\nreality of the occurrences which they relate will increase, until it\nacquires, for all practical purposes, the value and force of\ndemonstration.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 43. It should be remembered, that very little of the literature of their\ntimes and country has come down to us; and that the collateral sources and\nmeans of corroborating and explaining their writings are proportionally\nlimited. The contemporary writings and works of art which have reached us,\nhave invariably been found to confirm their accounts, to reconcile what\nwas apparently contradictory, and supply what seemed defective or\nimperfect. We ought therefore to conclude, that if we had more of the same\nlight, all other similar difficulties and imperfections would vanish.\nIndeed they have been gradually vanishing, and rapidly too, before the\nlight of modern research, conducted by men of science in our own times.\nAnd it is worthy of remark, that of all the investigations and discoveries\nof travellers and men of letters, since the overthrow of the Roman empire,\nnot a vestige of antiquity has been found, impeaching, in the slightest\ndegree, the credibility of the sacred writers; but, on the contrary, every\nresult has tended to confirm it.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 44. The essential marks of difference between true narratives of facts\nand the creations of fiction, have already been adverted to. It may here\nbe added that these attributes of truth are strikingly apparent throughout\nthe gospel histories, and that the absence of all the others is equally\nremarkable. The writers allude, for example, to the existing manners and\ncustoms, and to the circumstances of the times and of their country, with\nthe utmost minuteness of reference. And these references are never\nformally made, nor with preface and explanation, never multiplied and\nheaped on each other, nor brought together, as though introduced by\ndesign; but they are scattered broad-cast and singly over every part of\nthe story, and so connect themselves with every incident related, as to\nrender the detection of falsehood inevitable. This minuteness, too, is not\npeculiar to any one of the historians, but is common to them all. Though\nthey wrote at different periods, and without mutual concert, they all\nalike refer incidentally to the same state of affairs, and to the same\ncontemporary and collateral circumstances. Their testimony, in this view,\nstands on the same ground with that of four witnesses, separately examined\nbefore different commissioners, upon the same interrogatories, and all\nadverting incidentally to the same circumstances as surrounding and\naccompanying the principal transaction, to which alone their attention is\ndirected. And it is worthy of observation that these circumstances were at\nthat time of a peculiar character. Hardly a state or kingdom in the world\never experienced so many vicissitudes in its government and political\nrelations, as did Judea, during the period of the gospel history. It was\nsuccessively under the government of Herod the Great, of Archelaus, and of\na Roman magistrate; it was a kingdom, a tetrarchate, and a province; and\nits affairs, its laws, and the administration of justice, were all\ninvolved in the confusion and uncertainty naturally to be expected from\nrecent conquest. It would be difficult to select any place or period in\nthe history of nations, for the time and scene of a fictitious history or\nan imposture, which would combine so many difficulties for the fabricator\nto surmount, so many contemporary writers to confront him with, and so\nmany facilities for the detection of falsehood.(68)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 45. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHad the evangelists been false historians,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Dr. Chalmers,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey would not have committed themselves upon so many particulars. They\nwould not have furnished the vigilant inquirers of that period with such\nan effectual instrument for bringing them into discredit with the people;\nnor foolishly supplied, in every page of their narrative, so many\nmaterials for a cross-examination, which would infallibly have disgraced\nthem. Now, we of this age can institute the same cross-examination. We can\ncompare the evangelical writers with contemporary authors, and verify a\nnumber of circumstances in the history, and government, and peculiar\neconomy of the Jewish people. We therefore have it in our power to\ninstitute a cross-examination upon the writers of the New Testament; and\nthe freedom and frequency of their allusions to these circumstances supply\nus with ample materials for it. The fact, that they are borne out in their\nminute and incidental allusions by the testimony of other historians,\ngives a strong weight of what has been called circumstantial evidence in\ntheir favour. As a specimen of the argument, let us confine our\nobservations to the history of our Saviour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trial, and execution, and\nburial. They brought him to Pontius Pilate. We know both from Tacitus and\nJosephus, that he was at that time governor of Judea. A sentence from him\nwas necessary before they could proceed to the execution of Jesus; and we\nknow that the power of life and death was usually vested in the Roman\ngovernor. Our Saviour was treated with derision; and this we know to have\nbeen a customary practice at that time, previous to the execution of\ncriminals, and during the time of it. Pilate scourged Jesus before he gave\nhim up to be crucified. We know from ancient authors, that this was a very\nusual practice among the Romans. The accounts of an execution generally\nrun in this form: he was stripped, whipped, and beheaded or executed.\nAccording to the evangelists, his accusation was written on the top of the\ncross; and we learn from Suetonius and others, that the crime of the\nperson to be executed was affixed to the instrument of his punishment.\nAccording to the evangelists, this accusation was written in three\ndifferent languages; and we know from Josephus that it was quite common in\nJerusalem to have all public advertisements written in this manner.\nAccording to the evangelists, Jesus had to bear his cross; and we know\nfrom other sources of information, that this was the constant practice of\nthese times. According to the evangelists, the body of Jesus was given up\nto be buried at the request of friends. We know that, unless the criminal\nwas infamous, this was the law or the custom with all Roman\ngovernors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(69)\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 46. There is also a striking naturalness in the characters exhibited in\nthe sacred historians, rarely if ever found in works of fiction, and\nprobably nowhere else to be collected in a similar manner from fragmentary\nand incidental allusions and expressions, in the writings of different\npersons. Take, for example, that of Peter, as it may be gathered from the\nevangelists, and it will be hardly possible to conceive that four persons,\nwriting at different times, could have concurred in the delineation of\nsuch a character, if it were not real; a character too, we must observe,\nwhich is nowhere expressly drawn, but is shown only here and there,\ncasually, in the subordinate parts of the main narrative. Thus disclosed,\nit is that of a confident, sanguine, and zealous man; sudden and\nimpulsive, yet humble and ready to retract; honest and direct in his\npurposes; ardently loving his master, yet deficient in fortitude and\nfirmness in his cause.(70) When Jesus put any question to the apostles, it\nwas Peter who was foremost to reply;(71) and if they would inquire of\nJesus, it was Peter who was readiest to speak.(72) He had the impetuous\ncourage to cut off the ear of the High Priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s servant, who came to\narrest his master; and the weakness to dissemble before the Jews, in the\nmatter of eating with Gentile converts.(73) It was he who ran with John to\nthe sepulchre, on the first intelligence of the resurrection of Jesus, and\nwith characteristic zeal rushed in, while John paused without the\ndoor.(74) He had the ardour to desire and the faith to attempt to walk on\nthe water, at the command of his Lord, but as soon as he saw the wind\nboisterous, he was afraid.(75) He was the first to propose the election of\nanother apostle in the place of Judas;(76) and he it was who courageously\ndefended them all, on the day of Pentecost, when the multitude charged\nthem with being filled with new wine.(77) He was forward to acknowledge\nJesus to be the Messiah;(78) yet having afterwards endangered his own life\nby wounding the servant of the High Priest, he suddenly consulted his own\nsafety by denying the same Master, for whom, but a few hours before, he\nhad declared himself ready to die.(79) We may safely affirm that the\nannals of fiction afford no example of a similar but not uncommon\ncharacter, thus incidentally delineated.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 47. There are other internal marks of truth in the narratives of the\nevangelists, which, however, need here be only alluded to, as they have\nbeen treated with great fulness and force by able writers, whose works are\nfamiliar to all.(80) Among these may be mentioned the nakedness of the\nnarratives; the absence of all parade by the writers about their own\nintegrity, of all anxiety to be believed, or to impress others with a good\nopinion of themselves or their cause, of all marks of wonder, or of desire\nto excite astonishment at the greatness of the events they record, and of\nall appearance of design to exalt their Master. On the contrary, there is\napparently the most perfect indifference on their part, whether they are\nbelieved or not; or rather, the evident consciousness that they were\nrecording events well known to all, in their own country and times, and\nundoubtedly to be believed, like any other matter of public history, by\nreaders in all other countries and ages. It is worthy, too, of especial\nobservation, that though the evangelists record the unparalleled\nsufferings and cruel death of their beloved Lord, and this too, by the\nhands and with the consenting voices of those on whom he had conferred the\ngreatest benefits, and their own persecutions and dangers, yet they have\nbestowed no epithets of harshness or even of just censure on the authors\nof all this wickedness, but have everywhere left the plain and\nunincumbered narrative to speak for itself, and the reader to pronounce\nhis own sentence of condemnation; like true witnesses, who have nothing to\ngain or to lose by the event of the cause, they state the facts, and leave\nthem to their fate. Their simplicity and artlessness, also, should not\npass unnoticed, in readily stating even those things most disparaging to\nthemselves. Their want of faith in their Master, their dulness of\napprehension of his teachings, their strifes for pre\u00c3\u00abminence, their\ninclination to call fire from heaven upon their enemies, their desertion\nof their Lord in his hour of extreme peril; these, and many other\nincidents tending directly to their own dishonour, are nevertheless set\ndown with all the directness and sincerity of truth, as by men writing\nunder the deepest sense of responsibility to God. Some of the more\nprominent instances of this class of proofs will be noticed hereafter, in\ntheir proper places, in the narratives themselves.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 48. Lastly, the great character they have portrayed is perfect. It is\nthe character of a sinless Being; of one supremely wise and supremely\ngood. It exhibits no error, no sinister intention, no imprudence, no\nignorance, no evil passion, no impatience; in a word, no fault; but all is\nperfect uprightness, innocence, wisdom, goodness and truth. The mind of\nman has never conceived the idea of such a character, even for his gods;\nnor has history nor poetry shadowed it forth. The doctrines and precepts\nof Jesus are in strict accordance with the attributes of God, agreeably to\nthe most exalted idea which we can form of them, either from reason or\nfrom revelation. They are strikingly adapted to the capacity of mankind,\nand yet are delivered with a simplicity and majesty wholly divine. He\nspake as never man spake. He spake with authority; yet addressed himself\nto the reason and the understanding of men; and he spake with wisdom,\nwhich men could neither gainsay nor resist. In his private life, he\nexhibits a character not merely of strict justice, but of overflowing\nbenignity. He is temperate, without austerity; his meekness and humility\nare signal; his patience is invincible; truth and sincerity illustrate his\nwhole conduct; every one of his virtues is regulated by consummate\nprudence; and he both wins the love of his friends, and extorts the wonder\nand admiration of his enemies(81). He is represented in every variety of\nsituation in life, from the height of worldly grandeur, amid the\nacclamations of an admiring multitude, to the deepest abyss of human\ndegradation and woe, apparently deserted of God and man. Yet everywhere he\nis the same; displaying a character of unearthly perfection, symmetrical\nin all its proportions, and encircled with splendour more than human.\nEither the men of Galilee were men of superlative wisdom, of extensive\nknowledge and experience, and of deeper skill in the arts of deception,\nthan any and all others, before or after them, or they have truly stated\nthe astonishing things which they saw and heard.\n\nThe narratives of the evangelists are now submitted to the reader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nperusal and examination, upon the principles and by the rules already\nstated. For this purpose, and for the sake of more ready and close\ncomparison, they are arranged in juxtaposition, after the general order of\nthe latest and most approved harmonies. The question is not upon the\nstrict propriety of the arrangement, but upon the veracity of the\nwitnesses and the credibility of their narratives. With the relative\nmerits of modern harmonists, and with points of controversy among\ntheologians, the writer has no concern. His business is that of a lawyer,\nexamining the testimony of witnesses by the rules of his own profession,\nin order to ascertain whether, if they had thus testified on oath, in a\ncourt of justice, they would be entitled to credit; and whether their\nnarratives, as we now have them, would be received as ancient documents,\ncoming from the proper custody. If so, then it is believed that every\nhonest and impartial man will act consistently with that result, by\nreceiving their testimony in all the extent of its import. To write out a\nfull commentary or argument upon the text, would be a useless addition to\nthe bulk of the volume; but a few notes have been added for illustration\nof the narratives, and for the clearing up of apparent discrepancies, as\nbeing all that members of the legal profession would desire.\n\n\n\n\n\nHARMONY OF THE GOSPELS.\n\n\n\n\nPart I.

I. 1-8.\nIn those days came John the      The beginning of the gospel of\nBaptist, preaching in the        Jesus Christ the Son of God:\nwilderness of Judea,\n2 And saying, Repent ye; for     As it is written in the\nthe kingdom of heaven is at      prophets,(102) Behold, I send\nhand.                            my messenger before thy face,\n                                 which shall prepare thy way\n                                 before thee;\n3 For this is he that was        3 The voice of one crying in\nspoken of by the prophet         the wilderness, Prepare ye the\nEsaias, saying, The voice of     way of the Lord, make his\none crying in the wilderness,    paths straight.\nPrepare ye the way of the\nLord, make his paths straight.\n4 And the same John had his      4 John did baptize in the\nraiment of camel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair, and a   wilderness, and preach the\nleathern girdle about his        baptism of repentance, for the\nloins; and his meat was          remission of sins.\nlocusts and wild honey.\n5 Then went out to him           5 And there went out unto him\nJerusalem, and all Judea, and    all the land of Judea, and\nall the region round about       they of Jerusalem, and were\nJordan.                          all baptized of him in the\n                                 river of Jordan, confessing\n                                 their sins.\n6 And were baptized of him in    6 And John was clothed with\nJordan, confessing their sins.   camel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hair, and with a\n                                 girdle of a skin about his\n                                 loins; and he did eat locusts\n                                 and wild honey;\n7 But when he saw many of the    7 And preached, saying, There\nPharisees and Sadducees come     cometh one mightier than I\nto his baptism, he said unto     after me, the latchet of whose\nthem, O generation of vipers,    shoes I am not worthy to stoop\nwho hath warned you to flee      down and unloose.\nfrom the wrath to come?\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits   8 I indeed have baptized you\nmeet for repentance:             with water: but he shall\n                                 baptize you with the Holy\n                                 Ghost.\n9 And think not to say within\nyourselves, We have Abraham to\nour father: for I say unto\nyou, that God is able of these\nstones to raise up children\nunto Abraham.\n10 And now also the axe is\nlaid unto the root of the\ntrees: therefore every tree\nwhich bringeth not forth good\nfruit is hewn down, and cast\ninto the fire.\n11 I indeed baptize you with\nwater unto repentance: but he\nthat cometh after me is\nmightier than I, whose shoes I\nam not worthy to bear: he\nshall baptize you with the\nHoly Ghost, and _with_ fire:\n12 Whose fan _is_ in his hand,\nand he will thoroughly purge\nhis floor, and gather his\nwheat into the garner; but he\nwill burn up the chaff with\nunquenchable fire.\n\nLuke.\nCH. III. 1-18.\nNow in the fifteenth year of\nthe reign of Tiberius Cesar,\nPontius Pilate being governor\nof Judea, and Herod being\ntetrarch of Galilee, and his\nbrother Philip tetrarch of\nIturea and of the region of\nTrachonitis, and Lysanias the\ntetrarch of Abilene.\n2 Annas and Caiaphas being the\nhigh priests,(103) the word of\nGod came unto John the son of\nZacharias in the wilderness.\n3 And he came into all the\ncountry about Jordan,\npreaching the baptism of\nrepentance, for the remission\nof sins;\n4 As it is written in the book\nof the words of Esaias the\nprophet, saying,(104) The\nvoice of one crying in the\nwilderness, Prepare ye the way\nof the Lord, make his paths\nstraight.\n5 Every valley shall be\nfilled, and every mountain and\nhill shall be brought low; and\nthe crooked shall be made\nstraight, and the rough ways\nshall be made smooth;\n6 And all flesh shall see the\nsalvation of God.\n7 Then said he to the\nmultitude that came forth to\nbe baptized of him, O\ngeneration of vipers, who hath\nwarned you to flee from the\nwrath to come?\n8 Bring forth therefore fruits\nworthy of repentance, and\nbegin not to say within\nyourselves, We have Abraham to\n_our_ father: for I say unto\nyou, That God is able of these\nstones to raise up children\nunto Abraham.\n9 And now also the axe is laid\nunto the root of the trees:\nevery tree therefore which\nbringeth not forth good fruit,\nis hewn down, and cast into\nthe fire.\n10 And the people asked him,\nsaying, What shall we do then?\n11 He answereth and saith unto\nthem, He that hath two coats,\nlet him impart to him that\nhath none; and he that hath\nmeat, let him do likewise.\n12 Then came also publicans to\nbe baptized, and said unto\nhim, Master, what shall we do?\n13 And he said unto them,\nExact no more than that which\nis appointed you.\n14 And the soldiers likewise\ndemanded of him, saying, And\nwhat shall we do? And he said\nunto them, Do violence to no\nman, neither accuse _any_\nfalsely; and be content with\nyour wages.\n15 And as the people were in\nexpectation, and all men mused\nin their hearts of John,\nwhether he were the Christ, or\nnot;\n16 John answered, saying unto\n_them_ all, I indeed baptize\nyou with water; but one\nmightier than I cometh, the\nlatchet of whose shoes I am\nnot worthy to unloose: he\nshall baptize you with the\nHoly Ghost, and with fire:\n17 Whose fan _is_ in his hand,\nand he will thoroughly purge\nhis floor, and will gather the\nwheat into his garner; but the\nchaff he will burn with fire\nunquenchable.\n18 And many other things in\nhis exhortation preached he\nunto the people.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 15. The Baptism of Jesus. _The Jordan._\n\n\nMatthew.                         Mark.\nCH. III. 13-17.                  CH. I. 9-11.\n13 Then cometh Jesus from        9 And it came to pass in those\nGalilee to Jordan unto John,     days, that Jesus came from\nto be baptized of him.           Nazareth of Galilee, and was\n                                 baptized of John in Jordan.\n14 But John forbade him,         10 And straightway coming up\nsaying, I have need to be        out of the water, he saw the\nbaptized of thee, and comest     heavens opened, and the Spirit\nthou to me?                      like a dove descending upon\n                                 him.\n15 And Jesus answering said      11 And there came a voice from\nunto him, Suffer _it to be so_   heaven _saying_, Thou art my\nnow: for thus it becometh us     beloved Son, in whom I am well\nto fulfil all righteousness.     pleased.\nThen he suffered him.\n16 And Jesus, when he was\nbaptized, when up straightway\nout of the water: and lo, the\nheavens were opened unto him,\nand he saw the Spirit of God\ndescending like a dove, and\nlighting upon him:\n17 And lo, a voice from\nheaven, saying, This is my\nbeloved Son, in whom I am well\npleased.\n\nLuke.\nCH. III. 21-23.\n21 Now, when all the people\nwere baptized, it came to\npass, that Jesus also being\nbaptized, and praying, the\nheaven was opened,\n22 And the Holy Ghost\ndescended in a bodily shape\nlike a dove upon him, and a\nvoice came from heaven, which\nsaid, Thou art my beloved Son;\nin thee I am well pleased.\n23 And Jesus himself began to\nbe about thirty years of age.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 16.

I. 12-13.\nThen was Jesus led up of the     12 And immediately the Spirit\nSpirit into the wilderness to    driveth him into the\nbe tempted of the devil.         wilderness.\n2 And when he had fasted forty   13 And he was there in the\ndays and forty nights, he was    wilderness forty days tempted\nafterward an hungered.           of Satan; and was with the\n                                 wild beasts; and the angels\n                                 ministered unto him.\n3 And when the tempter came to\nhim, he said, If thou be the\nSon of God, command that these\nstones be made bread.\n4 But he answered and said, It\nis written(105) Man shall not\nlive by bread alone, but by\nevery word that proceedeth out\nof the mouth of God.\n5 Then the devil taketh him up\ninto the holy city, and\nsetteth him on a pinnacle of\nthe temple,\n6 And saith unto him, If thou\nbe the Son of God cast thyself\ndown, for it is written(106)\nHe shall give his angels\ncharge concerning thee: and in\n_their_ hands they shall bear\nthee up, lest at any time thou\ndash thy foot against a stone.\n7 Jesus said unto him, It is\nwritten again,(107) Thou shalt\nnot tempt the Lord thy God.\n8 Again, the devil taketh him\nup into an exceeding high\nmountain and sheweth him all\nthe kingdoms of the world, and\nthe glory of them:\n9 And saith unto him, All\nthese things will I give thee,\nif thou wilt fall down and\nworship me.\n10 Then saith Jesus unto him,\nGet thee hence, Satan: for it\nis written,(108) Thou shalt\nworship the Lord thy God, and\nhim only shalt thou serve.\n11 Then the devil leaveth him,\nand behold, angels came and\nministered unto him.\n\nLuke.\nCH.

And in those days\nhe did eat nothing: and when\nthey were ended, he afterward\nhungered.\n3 And the devil said unto him,\nIf thou be the Son of God,\ncommand this stone that it be\nmade bread.\n4 And Jesus answered him,\nsaying, It is written, That\nman shall not live by bread\nalone, but by every word of\nGod.\n9 And he brought him to\nJerusalem, and set him on a\npinnacle of the temple, and\nsaid unto him, If thou be the\nSon of God, cast thyself down\nfrom hence:\n10 For it is written, He shall\ngive his angels charge over\nthee, to keep thee:\n11 And in _their_ hands they\nshall bear thee up, lest at\nany time thou dash thy foot\nagainst a stone.\n12 And Jesus answering, said\nunto him, It is said, Thou\nshalt not tempt the Lord thy\nGod.\n5 And the devil, taking him up\ninto a high mountain, shewed\nunto him, all the kingdoms of\nthe world in a moment of time.\n6 And the devil said unto him,\nAll this power will I give\nthee, and the glory of them:\nfor that is delivered unto me,\nand to whomsoever I will, I\ngive it.\n7 If thou therefore wilt\nworship me, all shall be\nthine.\n8 And Jesus answered and said\nunto him, Get thee behind me,\nSatan: for it is written, Thou\nshalt worship the Lord thy\nGod, and him only shalt thou\nserve.\n13 And when the devil had\nended all the temptation, he\ndeparted from him for a\nseason.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 17.

He that\nhonoureth not the Son,\nhonoureth not the Father which\nhas sent him.\n24 Verily, verily, I say unto\nyou, He that heareth my word,\nand believeth on him that sent\nme, hath everlasting life, and\nshall not come into\ncondemnation; but is passed\nfrom death into life.\n25 Verily, verily, I say unto\nyou, The hour is coming, and\nnow is, when the dead shall\nhear the voice of the Son of\nGod: and they that hear shall\nlive.\n26 For as the Father hath life\nin himself, so hath he given\nto the Son to have life in\nhimself;\n27 And hath given him\nauthority to execute judgment\nalso, because he is the Son of\nman.\n28 Marvel not at this: for the\nhour is coming, in the which\nall that are in the graves\nshall hear his voice,\n29 And shall come forth; they\nthat have done good, unto the\nresurrection of life; and they\nthat have done evil, unto the\nresurrection of damnation.\n30 I can of mine own self do\nnothing: as I hear, I judge:\nand my judgment is just;\nbecause I seek not mine own\nwill, but the will of the\nFather which hath sent me.\n31 If I bear witness of\nmyself, my witness is not\ntrue.\n32 There is another that\nbeareth witness of me, and I\nknow that the witness which he\nwitnesseth of me is true.\n33 Ye sent unto John, and he\nbare witness unto the truth.\n34 But I receive not testimony\nfrom man: but these things I\nsay, that ye might be saved.\n35 He was a burning and a\nshining light: and ye were\nwilling for a season to\nrejoice in his light.\n36. But I have greater witness\nthan that of John: for the\nworks which the Father hath\ngiven me to finish, the same\nworks that I do, bear witness\nof me, that the Father hath\nsent me.\n37 And the Father himself\nwhich hath sent me, hath borne\nwitness of me. Ye have neither\nheard his voice(133) at any\ntime, nor seen his shape.\n38 And ye have not his word\nabiding in you: for whom he\nhath sent, him ye believe not.\n39 Search the scriptures; for\nin them ye think ye have\neternal life: And they are\nthey which testify of me.\n40 And ye will not come to me,\nthat ye might have life.\n41 I receive not honour from\nmen.\n42 But I know you, that ye\nhave not the love of God in\nyou.\n43 I am come in my Father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nname, and ye receive me not:\nif another shall come in his\nown name, him ye will receive.\n44 How can ye believe, which\nreceive honour one of another,\nand seek not the honour that\n_cometh_ from God only?\n45 Do not think that I will\naccuse you to the Father:\nthere is _one_ that accuseth\nyou, _even Moses_, in whom ye\ntrust.\n46 For had ye believed Moses,\nye would have believed me: for\nhe wrote of me.\n47 But if ye believe not his\nwritings, how shall ye believe\nmy words?\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 37.

A city that is set on a\nhill cannot be hid.\n15 Neither do men light a\ncandle, and put it under a\nbushel, but on a candlestick:\nand it giveth light unto all\nthat are in the house.\n16 let your light so shine\nbefore men, that they may see\nyour good works, and glorify\nyour Father which is in\nheaven.\n17 Think not that I am come to\ndestroy the law, or the\nprophets: I am not come to\ndestroy, but to fulfil.\n18 For verily, I say unto you,\nTill heaven and earth pass,\none jot or one tittle shall in\nno wise pass from the law,\ntill all be fulfilled.\n19 Whosoever therefore shall\nbreak one of these least\ncommandments, and shall teach\nmen so, he shall be called the\nleast in the kingdom of\nheaven: but whosoever shall\ndo, and teach _them_, the same\nshall be called great in the\nkingdom of heaven.\n20 For I say unto you, That\nexcept your righteousness\nshall exceed _the\nrighteousness_ of the scribes\nand Pharisees, ye shall in no\ncase enter into the kingdom of\nheaven.\n21 Ye have heard that it was\nsaid by them of old time, Thou\nshalt not kill;

lest at any time\nthe adversary deliver thee to\nthe judge, and the judge\ndeliver thee to the officer,\nand thou be cast into prison.\n26 Verily, I say unto thee,\nThou shall by no means come\nout thence, till thou hast\npaid the uttermost farthing.\n27 Ye have heard that it was\nsaid by them of old time, Thou\nshalt not commit adultery:\n28 But I say unto you, That\nwhosoever looketh on a woman\nto lust after her, hath\ncommitted adultery with her\nalready in his heart.\n29 And if thy right eye offend\nthee, pluck it out, and cast\n_it_ from thee: for it is\nprofitable for thee that one\nof thy members should perish,\nand not _that_ thy whole body\nshould be cast into hell.\n30 And if thy right hand\noffend thee, cut it off, and\ncast _it_ from thee: for it is\nprofitable for thee that one\nof thy members should perish,\nand not _that_ thy whole body\nshould be cast into hell.\n31 It hath been said,\nWhosoever shall put away his\nwife, let him give her a\nwriting of divorcement:\n32 But I say unto you, That\nwhosoever shall put away his\nwife, saving for the cause of\nfornication, causeth her to\ncommit adultery: and whosoever\nshall marry her that is\ndivorced, committeth adultery.\n33 Again, ye have heard that\nit hath been said by them of\nold time, Thou shalt not\nforswear thyself, but shalt\nperform unto the Lord thine\noaths:\n34 But I say unto you, Swear\nnot at all: neither by heaven;\nfor it is God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s throne:\n35 Nor by the earth; for it is\nhis footstool: neither by\nJerusalem; for it is the city\nof the great King:\n36 Neither shalt thou swear by\nthy head; because thou canst\nnot make one hair white or\nblack.\n37 But let your communication\nbe, Yea, yea;

VI.\n\nTake heed that ye do not your\nalms before men, to be seen of\nthem: otherwise ye have no\nreward of your Father which is\nin heaven.\n2 Therefore, when thou doest\n_thine_ alms, do not sound a\ntrumpet before thee, as the\nhypocrites do, in the\nsynagogues, and in the\nstreets, that they may have\nglory of men. Verily, I say\nunto you, They have their\nreward.\n3 But when thou doest alms,\nlet not thy left hand know\nwhat thy right hand doeth;\n4 That thine alms may be in\nsecret: and thy Father which\nseeth in secret, himself shall\nreward thee openly.\n5 And when thou prayest, thou\nshalt not be as the hypocrites\n_are_; for they love to pray\nstanding in the synagogues,\nand in the corners of the\nstreets, that they may be seen\nof men. Verily, I say unto\nyou, They have their reward.\n6 But thou, when thou prayest,\nenter into thy closet, and\nwhen thou hast shut thy door,\npray to thy Father which is in\nsecret; and thy Father, which\nseeth in secret, shall reward\nthee openly.\n7 But when ye pray, use not\nvain repetitions, as the\nheathen do: for they think\nthat they shall be heard for\ntheir much speaking.\n8 Be not yet therefore like\nunto them: for your Father\nknoweth what things ye have\nneed of before ye ask him.\n9 After this manner therefore\npray ye: Our Father which art\nin heaven, Hallowed be thy\nname.\n10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will\nbe done in earth as _it is_ in\nheaven.\n11 Give us this day our daily\nbread.\n12 And forgive us our debts,\nas we forgive our debtors.\n13 And lead us not into\ntemptation, but deliver us\nfrom evil. For thine is the\nkingdom, and the power, and\nthe glory, for ever. Amen.\n14 For, if ye forgive men\ntheir trespasses, your\nheavenly Father will also\nforgive you:\n15 But, if ye forgive not men\ntheir trespasses, neither will\nyour Father forgive your\ntrespasses.\n16 Moreover, when ye fast, be\nnot as the hypocrites, of a\nsad countenance: for they\ndisfigure their faces, that\nthey may appear unto men to\nfast. Verily, I say unto you,\nThey have their reward.\n17 But thou, when thou\nfastest, anoint thy head, and\nwash thy face;\n18 That thou appear not unto\nmen to fast, but unto thy\nFather, which is in secret:\nand thy Father, which seeth in\nsecret, shall reward thee\nopenly.\n19 Lay not up for yourselves\ntreasures upon earth, where\nmoth and rust doth corrupt,\nand where thieves break\nthrough and steal:\n20 But lay up for yourselves\ntreasures in heaven, where\nneither moth nor rust doth\ncorrupt, and where thieves do\nnot break through nor steal.\n21 For where your treasure is,\nthere will your heart be also.\n22 The light of the body is\nthe eye: if therefore thine\neye be single, thy whole body\nshall be full of light.\n23 But if thine eye be evil,\nthy whole body shall be full\nof darkness. If therefore the\nlight that is in thee be\ndarkness, how great _is_ that\ndarkness!\n24 No man can serve two\nmasters: for either he will\nhate the one, and love the\nother; or else he will hold to\nthe one, and despise the\nother. Ye cannot serve God and\nmammon.\n25 Therefore I say unto you,\nTake no thought for your life,\nwhat ye shall eat, or what ye\nshall drink; nor yet for your\nbody, what ye shall put on.

And he said unto\nhim, Thou hast rightly judged.\n44 And he turned to the woman,\nand said unto Simon, Seest\nthou this woman? I entered\ninto thine house, thou gavest\nme no water for my feet: but\nshe hath washed my feet with\ntears, and wiped _them_ with\nthe hairs of her head.\n45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but\nthis woman, since the time I\ncame in, hath not ceased to\nkiss my feet.\n46 My head with oil thou didst\nnot anoint: but this woman\nhath anointed my feet with\nointment.\n47 Wherefore I say unto thee,\nHer sins which are many, are\nforgiven; for she loved much:\nbut to whom little is\nforgiven, _the same_ loveth\nlittle.\n48 And he said unto her, Thy\nsins are forgiven.\n49 And they that sat at meat\nwith him, began to say within\nthemselves, Who is this that\nforgiveth sins also?\n50 And he said to the woman,\nThy faith hath saved thee; go\nin peace.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 47.

How much more\nare ye better than the fowls?\n25 And which of you with\ntaking thought can add to his\nstature one cubit?\n26 If ye then be not able to\ndo that thing which is least,\nwhy take ye thought for the\nrest?\n27 Consider the lilies how\nthey grow: they toil not, they\nspin not; and yet I say unto\nyou, that Solomon in all his\nglory was not arrayed like one\nof these.\n28 If then God so clothe the\ngrass, which is to-day in the\nfield, and to-morrow is cast\ninto the oven; how much more\n_will he clothe_ you, O ye of\nlittle faith?\n29 And seek not ye what ye\nshall eat, or what ye shall\ndrink, neither be ye of\ndoubtful mind.\n30 For all these things do the\nnations of the world seek\nafter: and your Father knoweth\nthat ye have need of these\nthings.\n31 But rather seek ye the\nkingdom of God, and all these\nthings shall be added unto\nyou.\n32 Fear not, little flock; for\nit is your Father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good\npleasure to give you the\nkingdom.\n33 Sell that ye have, and give\nalms: provide yourselves bags\nwhich wax not old, a treasure\nin the heavens that faileth\nnot, where no thief\napproacheth, neither moth\ncorrupteth.\n34 For where your treasure is,\nthere will your heart be also.\n35 Let your loins be girded\nabout, and _your_ lights\nburning;\n36 And ye yourselves like unto\nmen that wait for their lord,\nwhen he will return from the\nwedding; that, when he cometh\nand knocketh, they may open\nunto him immediately.\n37 Blessed _are_ those\nservants, whom the lord when\nhe cometh shall find watching:\nverily, I say unto you, that\nhe shall gird himself, and\nmake them to sit down to meat,\nand will come forth and serve\nthem.\n38 And if he shall come in the\nsecond watch, or come in the\nthird watch, and find _them_\nso, blessed are those\nservants.\n39 And this know, that if the\ngood man of the house had\nknown what hour the thief\nwould come, he would have\nwatched, and not have suffered\nhis house to be broken\nthrough.\n40 Be ye therefore ready also:\nfor the Son of man cometh at\nan hour when ye think not.\n41 Then Peter said unto him,\nLord, speakest thou this\nparable unto us, or even to\nall?\n42 And the Lord said, Who then\nis that faithful and wise\nsteward, whom his lord shall\nmake ruler over his household,\nto give _them their_ portion\nof meat in due season?\n43 Blessed _is_ that servant,\nwhom his lord when he cometh\nshall find so doing.\n44 Of a truth I say unto you,\nThat he will make him ruler\nover all that he hath.\n45 But and if that servant say\nin his heart, My lord delayeth\nhis coming; and shall begin to\nbeat the men-servants, and\nmaidens, and to eat and drink,\nand to be drunken;\n46 The lord of that servant\nwill come in a day when he\nlooketh not for _him_, and at\nan hour when he is not aware,\nand will cut him in sunder,\nand will appoint him his\nportion with the unbelievers.\n47 And that servant which knew\nhis lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s will, and prepared\nnot _himself_, neither did\naccording to his will, shall\nbe beaten with many _stripes_.\n48 But he that knew not, and\ndid commit things worthy of\nstripes, shall be beaten with\nfew _stripes_. For unto\nwhomsoever much is given, of\nhim shall much be required;\nand to whom men have committed\nmuch, of him they will ask the\nmore.\n49 I am come to send fire on\nthe earth, and what will I, if\nit be already kindled?\n50 But I have a baptism to be\nbaptized with; and how am I\nstraitened till it be\naccomplished!\n51 Suppose ye that I am come\nto give peace on earth?

This is he\nwhich received seed by the\nway-side.\n                                 15 And these are they by the\n                                 way-side, where the word is\n                                 sown; but when they have\n                                 heard, Satan cometh\n                                 immediately, and taketh away\n                                 the word that was sown in\n                                 their hearts.\n20 But he that received the      16 And these are they likewise\nseed into stony places, the      which are sown on stony\nsame is he that heareth the      ground; who, when they have\nword, and anon with joy          heard the word, immediately\nreceiveth it;                    receive it with gladness;\n21 Yet hath he not root in       17 And have no root in\nhimself, but dureth for a        themselves, and so endure but\nwhile: for when tribulation or   for a time: afterward, when\npersecution ariseth because of   affliction or persecution\nthe word, by and by he is        ariseth for the word\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake,\noffended.                        immediately they are offended.\n22 He also that received seed    18 and these are they which\namong the thorns is he that      are sown among thorns; such as\nheareth the word; and the care   hear the word,\nof this world, and the\ndeceitfulness of riches, choke\nthe word, and he becometh\nunfruitful.\n                                 19 And the cares of this\n                                 world, and the deceitfulness\n                                 of riches, and the lusts of\n                                 other things entering in,\n                                 choke the word, and it\n                                 becometh unfruitful.\n23 But he that received seed     20 And these are they which\ninto the good ground is he       are sown on good ground; such\nthat heareth the word, and       as hear the word, and receive\nunderstandeth _it_; which also   it, and bring forth fruit,\nbeareth fruit, and bringeth      some thirty-fold, some sixty,\nforth, some a hundred-fold,      and some a hundred.\nsome sixty, some thirty.\n                                 21 And he said unto them, Is a\n                                 candle brought to be put under\n                                 a bushel, or under a bed? and\n                                 not to be set on a\n                                 candlestick?\n                                 22 For there is nothing hid,\n                                 which shall not be manifested;\n                                 neither was any thing kept\n                                 secret, but that it should\n                                 come abroad.\n                                 23 If any man have ears to\n                                 hear, let him hear.\n                                 24 And he said unto them, Take\n                                 heed what ye hear: With what\n                                 measure ye mete, it shall be\n                                 measured to you: and unto you\n                                 that hear shall more be given.\n                                 25 For he that hath, to him\n                                 shall be given: and he that\n                                 hath not, from him shall be\n                                 taken even that which he hath.\n\nLuke.\nCH. VIII. 4-18.\n4 And when much people were\ngathered together, and were\ncome to him out of every city,\nhe spake by a parable:\n5 A sower went out to sow his\nseed: and as he sowed, some\nfell by the way-side; and it\nwas trodden down, and the\nfowls of the air devoured it.\n6 And some fell upon a rock;\nand as soon as it was sprung\nup, it withered away, because\nit lacked moisture.\n7 And some fell among thorns;\nand the thorns sprang up with\nit, and choked it.\n8 And other fell on good\nground, and sprang up, and\nbare fruit a hundred-fold. And\nwhen he had said these things,\nhe cried, He that hath ears to\nhear, let him hear.\n9 And his disciples asked him,\nsaying, What might this\nparable be?\n10 And he said, Unto you it is\ngiven to know the mysteries of\nthe kingdom of God: but to\nothers in parables; that\nseeing they might not see, and\nhearing they might not\nunderstand.\n11 Now the parable is this:\nThe seed is the word of God.\n12 Those by the way-side, are\nthey that hear: then cometh\nthe devil, and taketh away the\nword out of their hearts, lest\nthey should believe and be\nsaved.\n13 They on the rock _are\nthey_, which, when they hear,\nreceive the word with joy; and\nthese have no root, which for\na while believe, and in times\nof temptation fall away.\n14 And that which fell among\nthorns, are they, which, when\nthey have heard, go forth, and\nare choked with cares, and\nriches, and pleasures of\n_this_ life, and bring no\nfruit to perfection.\n15 But that on the good ground\nare they, which, in an honest\nand good heart, having heard\nthe word, keep _it_, and bring\nforth fruit with patience.\n16 No man, when he hath\nlighted a candle, covereth it\nwith a vessel, or putteth _it_\nunder a bed; but setteth _it_\non a candlestick, that they\nwhich enter in may see the\nlight.\n17 For nothing is secret, that\nshall not be made manifest;\nneither _anything_ hid, that\nshall not be known, and come\nabroad.\n18 Take heed therefore how ye\nhear: for whosoever hath, to\nhim shall be given: and\nwhosoever hath not, from him\nshall be taken even that which\nhe seemeth to have.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 55.

IV. 26-34.\n24 Another parable put he\nforth unto them, saying, The\nkingdom of heaven is likened\nunto a man which sowed good\nseed in his field:\n25 But while men slept, his\nenemy came and sowed tares\namong the wheat, and went his\nway.\n26 But when the blade was\nsprung up, and brought forth\nfruit, then appeared the tares\nalso.\n27 So the servants of the\nhouseholder came and said unto\nhim, Sir, didst not thou sow\ngood seed in thy field? from\nwhence then hath it tares?\n28 He said unto them, An enemy   26 And he said, So is the\nhath done this. The servant      kingdom of God, as if a man\nsaid unto him, Wilt thou then    should cast seed into the\nthat we go and gather them up?   ground;\n29 But he said, Nay; lest        27 And should sleep, and rise\nwhile ye gather up the tares,    night and day, and the seed\nye root up also the wheat with   should spring and grow up, he\nthem.                            knoweth not how.\n30 Let both grow together        28 For the earth bringeth\nuntil the harvest: and in the    forth fruit of herself; first\ntime of harvest I will say to    the blade, then the ear, after\nthe reapers, Gather ye           that the full corn in the ear.\ntogether first the tares, and\nbind them in bundles to burn\nthem: but gather the wheat\ninto my barn.\n                                 29 But when the fruit is\n                                 brought forth, immediately he\n                                 putteth in the sickle, because\n                                 the harvest is come.\n31 Another parable put he        30 And he said, Whereunto\nforth unto them, saying, The     shall we liken the kingdom of\nkingdom of heaven is like to a   God? or with what comparison\ngrain of mustard-seed, which a   shall we compare it?\nman took, and sowed in his\nfield:\n32 Which indeed is the least     31 It _is_ like a grain of\nof all seeds: but when it is     mustard-seed, which when it is\ngrown, it is the greatest        sown in the earth, in less\namong herbs, and becometh a      than all the seeds that be in\ntree, so that the birds of the   the earth:\nair come and lodge in the\nbranches thereof.\n33 Another parable spake he      32 But when it is sown, it\nunto them; The kingdom of        groweth up, and becometh\nheaven is like unto leaven,      greater than all herbs, and\nwhich a woman took, and hid in   shooteth out great branches;\nthree measures of meal, till     so that the fowls of the air\nthe whole was leavened.          may lodge under the shadow of\n                                 it.\n34 All these things spake        33 And with many such parables\nJesus unto the multitude in      spake he the word unto them,\nparables; and without a          as they were able to hear\nparable spake he not unto        _it_.\nthem:\n35 That it might be fulfilled    34 But without a parable spake\nwhich was spoken by the          he not unto them: and when\nprophet,(161) saying, I will     they were alone, he expounded\nopen my mouth in parables; I     all things to his disciples.\nwill utter things which have\nbeen kept secret from the\nfoundation of the world.\n36 Then Jesus sent the\nmultitude away, and went into\nthe house: and his disciples\ncame unto him, saying, Declare\nunto us the parable of the\ntares of the field.\n37 He answered and said unto\nthem, He that soweth the good\nseed is the Son of man;\n38 The field is the world; the\ngood seed are the children of\nthe kingdom; but the tares are\nthe children of the wicked\n_one_;\n39 The enemy that sowed them\nis the devil; the harvest is\nthe end of the world; and the\nreapers are the angels.\n40 As therefore the tares are\ngathered and burned in the\nfire; so shall it be in the\nend of this world.\n41 The Son of man shall send\nforth his angels, and they\nshall gather out of his\nkingdom all things that\noffend, and them which do\niniquity;\n42 And shall cast them into a\nfurnace of fire; there shall\nbe wailing and gnashing of\nteeth.\n43 Then shall the righteous\nshine forth as the sun in the\nkingdom of their Father. Who\nhath ears to hear, let him\nhear.\n44 Again, The kingdom of\nheaven is like unto treasure\nhid in a field; the which when\na man hath found, he hideth,\nand for joy thereof goeth and\nselleth all that he hath, and\nbuyeth that field.\n45 Again, The kingdom of\nheaven is like unto a\nmerchant-man seeking goodly\npearls:\n46 Who, when he had found one\npearl of great price, went and\nsold all that he had, and\nbought it.\n47 Again, The kingdom of\nheaven is like unto a net,\nthat was cast into the sea,\nand gathered of every kind:\n48 Which, when it was full,\nthey drew to shore, and sat\ndown, and gathered the good\ninto vessels, but cast the bad\naway.\n49 So shall it be at the end\nof the world: the angels shall\ncome forth, and sever the\nwicked from among the just,\n50 And shall cast them into\nthe furnace of fire: there\nshall be wailing and gnashing\nof teeth.\n51 Jesus saith unto them, Have\nye understood all these\nthings? They say unto him,\nYea, Lord.\n52 Then said he unto them,\nTherefore every scribe _which\nis_ instructed unto the\nkingdom of heaven, is like\nunto a man _that is_ a\nhouseholder, which bringeth\nforth out of his treasure\n_things_ new and old.\n53 And it came to pass, _that_\nwhen Jesus had finished these\nparables, he departed thence.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 56.

Then he arose, and        sea, Peace, be still: and the\nrebuked the winds and the sea;   wind ceased, and there was a\nand there was a great calm.      great calm.\n                                 40 And he said unto them, Why\n                                 are ye so fearful? how is that\n                                 ye have no faith?\n27 But the men marvelled,        41 And they feared\nsaying, What manner of man is    exceedingly, and said one to\nthis, that even the winds and    another, What manner of man is\nthe sea obey him!                this, that even the wind and\n                                 the sea obey him?\n\nLuke.\nCH.

and one of\nthem shall not fall on the\nground without your Father.\n30 But the very hairs of your\nhead are all numbered.\n31 Fear ye not therefore, ye\nare of more value than many\nsparrows.\n32 Whosoever therefore shall\nconfess me before men, him\nwill I confess also before my\nFather which is in heaven.\n33 But whosoever shall deny me\nbefore men, him will I also\ndeny before my Father which is\nin heaven.\n34 Think not that I am come to\nsend peace on earth; I came\nnot to send peace, but a\nsword.\n35 For I am come to set a man\nat variance against his\nfather, and the daughter\nagainst her mother, and the\ndaughter-in-law against her\nmother-in-law.\n36 And a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foes _shall be_\nthey of his own\nhousehold.(171)\n37 He that loveth father or\nmother more than me, is not\nworthy of me: and he that\nloveth son or daughter more\nthan me, is not worthy of me.\n38 And he that taketh not his\ncross, and followeth after me,\nis not worthy of me.\n39 He that findeth his life\nshall lose it: and he that\nloseth his life for my sake,\nshall find it.\n40 He that receiveth you,\nreceiveth me; and he that\nreceiveth me, receiveth him\nthat sent me.\n41 He that receiveth a prophet\nin the name of a prophet,\nshall receive a prophet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreward; and he that receiveth\na righteous man in the name of\na righteous man, shall receive\na righteous man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reward.\n42 And whosoever shall give to\ndrink unto one of these little\nones, a cup of cold _water_\nonly, in the name of a\ndisciple, verily, I say unto\nyou, he shall in no wise lose\nhis reward.\nCH.

Every\nman therefore that hath heard,\nand hath learned of the\nFather, cometh unto me.\n46 Not that any man hath seen\nthe Father, save he which is\nof God, he hath seen the\nFather.\n47 Verily, verily, I say unto\nyou, He that believeth on me\nhath everlasting life.\n48 I am that bread of\nlife.(180)\n49 Your fathers did eat manna\nin the wilderness, and are\ndead.\n50 This is the bread which\ncometh down from heaven, that\na man may eat therof, and not\ndie.\n51 I am the living bread which\ncame down from heaven: if any\nman eat of this bread, he\nshall live for ever: and the\nbread that I will give is my\nflesh, which I will give for\nthe life of the world.\n52 The Jews therefore strove\namong themselves, saying, How\ncan this man give us _his_\nflesh to eat?\n53 Then Jesus said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto\nyou, Except ye eat the flesh\nof the Son of man, and drink\nhis blood, ye have no life in\nyou.\n54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and\ndrinketh my blood, hath\neternal life; and I will raise\nhim up at the last day.\n55 For my flesh is meat\nindeed, and my blood is drink\nindeed.\n56 He that eateth my flesh,\nand drinketh my blood,\ndwelleth in me, and I in him.\n57 As the living Father hath\nsent me, and I live by the\nFather: so he that eateth me,\neven he shall live by me.\n58 This is that bread which\ncame down from heaven: not as\nyour fathers did eat manna,\nand are dead: he that eateth\nof this bread shall live for\never.\n59 These things said he in the\nsynagogue, as he taught in\nCapernaum.\n60 Many therefore of his\ndisciples, when they had heard\n_this_, said, This is a hard\nsaying; who can hear it?\n61 When Jesus knew in himself\nthat his disciples murmured at\nit, he said unto them, Doth\nthis offend you?\n62 _What_ and if ye shall see\nthe Son of man ascend up where\nhe was before?\n63 It is the Spirit that\nquickeneth; the flesh\nprofiteth nothing: the words\nthat I speak unto you, _they_\nare spirit, and _they_ are\nlife.\n64 But there are some of you\nthat believe not. For Jesus\nknew from the beginning who\nthey were that believe not,\nand who should betray him.\n65 And he said, Therefore said\nI unto you, that no man can\ncome unto me, except it were\ngiven unto him of my Father.\n66 From that _time_ many of\nhis disciples went back,(181)\nand walked no more with him.\n67 Then said Jesus unto the\ntwelve, Will ye also go away?\n68 Then Simon Peter answered\nhim, Lord, to whom shall we\ngo? thou hast the words of\neternal life.\n69 And we believe, and are\nsure that thou art that\nChrist, the Son of the living\nGod.\n70 Jesus answered them, Have\nnot I chosen you twelve, and\none of you is a devil?(182)\n71 He spake of Judas Iscariot\n_the son_ of Simon: for he it\nwas that should betray him,\nbeing one of the twelve.\nCH.

VIII. 1.\n11 Then the Jews sought him at\nthe feast, and said, Where is\nhe?\n12 And there was much\nmurmuring among the people\nconcerning him: for some said,\nHe is a good man: others said,\nNay; but he deceiveth the\npeople.\n13 Howbeit, no man spake\nopenly of him, for fear of the\nJews.\n14 Now, about the midst of the\nfeast, Jesus went up into the\ntemple and taught.\n15 And the Jews marvelled,\nsaying, How knoweth this man\nletters, having never learned?\n16 Jesus answered them, and\nsaid, My doctrine is not mine,\nbut his that sent me.\n17 If any man will do his\nwill, he shall know of the\ndoctrine, whether it be of\nGod, or _whether_ I speak of\nmyself.\n18 He that speaketh of\nhimself, seeketh his own\nglory: but he that seeketh his\nglory that sent him, the same\nis true, and no\nunrighteousness is in him.\n19 Did not Moses give you the\nlaw, and _yet_ none of you\nkeepeth the law? Why go ye\nabout to kill me?\n20 The people answered and\nsaid, Thou hast a devil: who\ngoeth about to kill thee?\n21 Jesus answered and said\nunto them, I have done one\nwork, and ye all marvel.\n22 Moses therefore gave unto\nyou circumcision, (not because\nit is of Moses, but of the\nfathers;) and ye on the\nsabbath-day circumcise a\nman.(199)\n23 If a man on the sabbath-day\nreceive circumcision, that the\nlaw of Moses should not be\nbroken; are ye angry at me,\nbecause I have made a man\nevery whit whole on the\nsabbath-day?\n24 Judge not according to the\nappearance, but judge\nrighteous judgement.\n25 Then said some of them of\nJerusalem, Is not this he whom\nthey seek to kill?\n26 But lo, he speaketh boldly,\nand they say nothing unto him.\nDo the rulers know indeed that\nthis is the very Christ?\n27 Howbeit, we know this man,\nwhence he is: but when Christ\ncometh, no man knoweth whence\nhe is.\n28 Then cried Jesus in the\ntemple, as he taught, saying,\nYe both know me, and ye know\nwhence I am: and I am not come\nof myself, but he that sent me\nis true, whom ye know not.\n29 But I know him; for I am\nfrom him, and he hath sent me.\n30 Then they sought to take\nhim: but no man laid hands on\nhim, because his hour was not\nyet come.\n31 And many of the people\nbelieved on him, and said,\nWhen Christ cometh, will he do\nmore miracles than these which\nthis _man_ hath done?\n32 The Pharisees heard that\nthe people murmured such\nthings concerning him: and the\nPharisees and the chief\npriests sent officers to take\nhim.\n33 Then said Jesus unto them,\nYet a little while am I with\nyou, and _then_ I go unto him\nthat sent me.\n34 Ye shall seek me, and shall\nnot find _me_: and where I am,\n_thither_ ye cannot come.\n35 Then said the Jews among\nthemselves, Whither will he\ngo, that we shall not find\nhim? will he go unto the\ndispersed among the Gentiles,\nand teach the Gentiles?\n36 What _manner_ of saying is\nthis that he said, Ye shall\nseek me, and shall not find\n_me_, and where I am,\n_thither_ ye cannot come;\n37 In the last day, that great\n_day_ of the feast,(200) Jesus\nstood and cried, saying, If\nany man thirst, let him come\nunto me, and drink.\n38 He that believeth on me, as\nthe scripture hath said,(201)\nout of his belly shall flow\nrivers of living water.\n39 (But this spake he of the\nSpirit, which they that\nbelieve on him should receive,\nfor the Holy Ghost was not yet\n_given_, because that Jesus\nwas not yet glorified.)\n40 Many of the people\ntherefore, when they heard\nthis saying, said, Of a truth\nthis is the Prophet.\n41 Others said, This is the\nChrist. But some said, Shall\nChrist come out of Galilee?\n42 Hath not the scripture\nsaid,(202) That Christ cometh\nof the seed of David, and out\nof the town of Bethlehem,\nwhere David was?\n43 So there was a division\namong the people because of\nhim.\n44 And some of them would have\ntaken him; but no man laid\nhands on him.\n45 Then came the officers to\nthe chief priests and\nPharisees; and they said unto\nthem, Why have ye not brought\nhim?\n46 The officers answered,\nNever man spake like this man.\n47 Then answered them the\nPharisees, Are ye also\ndeceived?\n48 Have any of the rulers, or\nof the Pharisees believed on\nhim?\n49 But this people who knoweth\nnot the law are cursed.\n50 Nicodemus saith unto them,\n(he that came to Jesus by\nnight, being one of them,)\n51 Doth our law judge _any_\nman before it hear him, and\nknow what he doeth?\n52 They answered and said unto\nhim, Art thou also of Galilee:\nSearch, and look: for out of\nGalilee ariseth no prophet.\n53 And every man went unto his\nown house.\nCH.

But Jesus stooped\ndown, and with his finger\nwrote on the ground, _as\nthough he heard them not_.\n7 So when they continued\nasking him, he lifted up\nhimself, and said unto them,\nHe that is without sin among\nyou, let him first cast a\nstone(206) at her.\n8 And again he stooped down,\nand wrote on the ground.\n9 And they which heard _it_,\nbeing convicted by their _own_\nconscience, went out one by\none, beginning at the eldest,\n_even_ unto the last: and\nJesus was left alone, and the\nwoman standing in the midst.\n10 When Jesus had lifted up\nhimself, and saw none but the\nwoman, he said unto her,\nWoman, where are those thine\naccusers? hath no man\ncondemned thee?\n11 She said, No man, Lord. And\nJesus said unto her, Neither\ndo I condemn thee: go, and sin\nno more.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 85. Further public teaching of our Lord.

Jesus\nanswered, Ye neither know me,\nnor my Father: if ye had known\nme, ye should have known my\nFather also.\n20 These words spake Jesus in\nthe treasury, as he taught in\nthe temple: and no man laid\nhands on him, for his hour was\nnot yet come.\n21 Then said Jesus again unto\nthem, I go my way, and ye\nshall seek me, and shall die\nin your sins: whither I go, ye\ncannot come.\n22 Then said the Jews, Will he\nkill himself? because he\nsaith, Whither I go, ye cannot\ncome.\n23 And he said unto them, Ye\nare from beneath; I am from\nabove: ye are of this world; I\nam not of this world.\n24 I said therefore unto you,\nthat ye shall die in your\nsins: for if ye believe not\nthat I am _he_, ye shall die\nin your sins.\n25 Then said they unto him,\nWho art thou? And Jesus saith\nunto them, Even _the same_\nthat I said unto you from the\nbeginning.\n26 I have many things to say,\nand to judge of you: but he\nthat sent me, is true; and I\nspeak to the world those\nthings which I have heard of\nhim.\n27 They understood not that he\nspake to them of the Father.\n28 Then said Jesus unto them,\nWhen ye have lifted up the Son\nof man, then shall ye know\nthat I am _he_, and _that_ I\ndo nothing of myself; but as\nmy Father hath taught me, I\nspeak these things.\n29 And he that sent me is with\nme: the Father hath not left\nme alone; for I do always\nthose things that please him.\n30 As he spake these words,\nmany believed on him.(209)\n31 Then said Jesus to those\nJews which believed on him, If\nye continue in my word, _then_\nare ye my disciples indeed;\n32 And ye shall know the\ntruth, and the truth shall\nmake you free.\n33 They answered him, We be\nAbraham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seed, and were never\nin bondage to any man: how\nsayest thou, Ye shall be made\nfree?\n34 Jesus answered them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto\nyou, Whosoever committeth sin,\nis the servant of sin.\n35 And the servant abideth not\nin the house for ever, _but_\nthe Son abideth ever.\n36 If the Son therefore shall\nmake you free, ye shall be\nfree indeed.\n37 I know that ye are\nAbraham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seed; but ye seek to\nkill me, because my word hath\nno place in you.\n38 I speak that which I have\nseen with my Father: and ye do\nthat which ye have seen with\nyour father.\n39 They answered and said unto\nhim, Abraham is our father.\nJesus saith unto them, If ye\nwere Abraham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children, ye\nwould do the works of Abraham.\n40 But now ye seek to kill me,\na man that hath told you the\ntruth, which I have heard of\nGod: this did not Abraham.\n41 Ye do the deeds of your\nfather. Then said they to him,\nWe be not born of fornication;\nwe have one Father, _even_\nGod.\n42 Jesus said unto them, If\nGod were your Father, ye would\nlove me: for I proceeded forth\nand came from God; neither\ncame I of myself, but he sent\nme.\n43 Why do ye not understand my\nspeech? even because ye cannot\nhear my word.\n44 Ye are of _your_ father the\ndevil, and the lusts of your\nfather ye will do: he was a\nmurderer from the beginning,\nand abode not in the truth;\nbecause there is no truth in\nhim. When he speaketh a lie,\nhe speaketh of his own: for he\nis a liar, and the father of\nit.\n45 And because I tell you the\ntruth, ye believe me not.\n46 Which of you convinceth me\nof sin? And if I say the\ntruth, why do ye not believe\nme?\n47 He that is of God, heareth\nGod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words: ye therefore hear\n_them_ not, because ye are not\nof God.\n48 Then answered the Jews, and\nsaid unto him, Say we not well\nthat thou art a Samaritan, and\nhast a devil?\n49 Jesus answered, I have not\na devil: but I honour my\nFather, and ye do dishonour\nme.\n50 And I seek not mine own\nglory: there is one that\nseeketh and judgeth.\n51 Verily, verily, I say unto\nyou, If a man keep my saying,\nhe shall never see death.\n52 Then said the Jews unto\nhim, Now we know that thou\nhast a devil. Abraham is dead,\nand the prophets; and thou\nsayest, If a man keep my\nsaying, he shall never taste\nof death.\n53 Art thou greater than our\nfather Abraham, which is dead!\nand the prophets are dead:\nwhom makest thou thyself?\n54 Jesus answered, If I honour\nmyself, my honour is nothing:\nit is my Father that honoureth\nme, of whom ye say, that he is\nyour God.\n55 Yet ye have not known him;\nbut I know him: and if I\nshould say, I know him not, I\nshall be a liar like unto you:\nbut I know him, and keep his\nsaying.\n56 Your father Abraham\nrejoiced to see my day: and he\nsaw _it_, and was glad.\n57 Then said the Jews unto\nhim, Thou art not yet fifty\nyears old, and hast thou seen\nAbraham?\n58 Jesus said unto them,\nVerily, verily, I say unto\nyou, Before Abraham was, I am.\n59 Then took they up stones to\ncast at him: but Jesus hid\nhimself, and went out of the\ntemple, going through the\nmidst of them, and so passed\nby.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 86.

He said, I know\nnot.\n13 They brought to the\nPharisees him that aforetime\nwas blind.\n14 And it was the sabbath-day\nwhen Jesus made the clay, and\nopened his eyes.\n15 Then again the Pharisees\nalso asked him how he had\nreceived his sight. He said\nunto them, He put clay upon\nmine eyes, and I washed, and\ndo see.\n16 Therefore said some of the\nPharisees, This man is not of\nGod, because he keepeth not\nthe sabbath-day. Others said,\nHow can a man that is a sinner\ndo such miracles? And there\nwas a division among them.\n17 They say unto the blind man\nagain, What sayest thou of\nhim, that he hath opened thine\neyes? He said, He is a\nprophet.\n18 But the Jews did not\nbelieve concerning him, that\nhe had been blind, and\nreceived his sight, until they\ncalled the parents of him that\nhad received his sight.\n19 And they asked them,\nsaying, Is this your son, who\nye say was born blind? How\nthen doth he now see?\n20 His parents answered them\nand said, We know that this is\nour son, and that he was born\nblind:\n21 But by what means he now\nseeth, we know not; or who\nhath opened his eyes, we know\nnot: he is of age; ask him: he\nshall speak for himself.\n22 These _words_ spake his\nparents, because they feared\nthe Jews: for the Jews had\nagreed already, that if any\nman did confess that he was\nChrist, he should be put out\nof the synagogue.\n23 Therefore said his parents,\nHe is of age; ask him.\n24 Then again called they the\nman that was blind, and said\nunto him, Give God the praise:\nwe know that this man is a\nsinner.\n25 He answered and said,\nWhether he be a sinner _or\nno_, I know not: one thing I\nknow, that, whereas I was\nblind, now I see.\n26 Then said they to him\nagain, What did he to thee?\nhow opened he thine eyes?\n27 He answered them, I have\ntold you already, and ye did\nnot hear: wherefore would ye\nhear _it_ again? will ye also\nbe his disciples?\n28 Then they reviled him, and\nsaid, Thou art his disciple,\nbut we are Moses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disciples.\n29 We know that God spake unto\nMoses; _as for_ this _fellow_,\nwe know not from whence he is.\n30 The man answered and said\nunto them, Why, herein is a\nmarvellous thing, that ye know\nnot from whence he is, and\n_yet_ he hath opened mine\neyes.\n31 Now we know that God\nheareth not sinners; but if\nany man be a worshipper of\nGod, and doeth his will, him\nhe heareth.\n32 Since the world began was\nit not heard that any man\nopened the eyes of one that\nwas born blind.\n33 If this man were not of\nGod, he could do nothing.\n34 They answered and said unto\nhim, Thou wast altogether born\nin sins, and dost thou teach\nus? And they cast him out.\n35 Jesus heard that they had\ncast him out: and when he had\nfound him, he said unto him,\nDost thou believe on the Son\nof God?\n36 He answered and said, Who\nis he, Lord, that I might\nbelieve on him?\n37 And Jesus said unto him,\nThou hast both seen him, and\nit is he that talketh with\nthee.\n38 And he said, Lord, I\nbelieve. And he worshipped\nhim.\n39 And Jesus said, For\njudgment I am come into this\nworld; that they which see not\nmight see; and that they which\nsee might be made blind.\n40 And _some_ of the Pharisees\nwhich were with him heard\nthese words, and said unto\nhim, Are we blind also?\n41 Jesus said unto them, If ye\nwere blind, ye should have no\nsin: but now ye say, We see;\ntherefore your sin remaineth.\nCH. X.\nVerily, verily, I say unto\nyou, He that entereth not by\nthe door into the sheepfold,\nbut climbeth up some other\nway, the same is a thief and a\nrobber.\n2 But he that entereth in by\nthe door is the shepherd of\nthe sheep.\n3 To him the porter openeth;\nand the sheep hear his voice:\nand he calleth his own sheep\nby name, and leadeth them out.\n4 And when he putteth forth\nhis own sheep, he goeth before\nthem, and the sheep follow\nhim: for they know his voice.\n5 And a stranger will they not\nfollow, but will flee from\nhim: for they know not the\nvoice of strangers.\n6 This parable spake Jesus\nunto them: but they understood\nnot what things they were\nwhich he spake unto them.\n7 Then said Jesus unto them\nagain, Verily, verily, I say\nunto you, I am the door of the\nsheep.\n8 All that ever came before me\nare thieves and robbers: but\nthe sheep did not hear them.\n9 I am the door: by me if any\nman enter in, he shall be\nsaved, and shall go in and\nout, and find pasture.\n10 The thief cometh not, but\nfor to steal, and to kill, and\nto destroy: I am come that\nthey might have life, and that\nthey might have it more\nabundantly.\n11 I am the good shepherd: the\ngood shepherd giveth his life\nfor the sheep.\n12 But he that is a hireling,\nand not the shepherd, whose\nown the sheep are not, seeth\nthe wolf coming, and leaveth\nthe sheep, and fleeth; and the\nwolf catcheth them, and\nscattereth the sheep.\n13 The hireling fleeth,\nbecause he is a hireling, and\ncareth not for the sheep.\n14 I am the good shepherd, and\nknow my _sheep_, and am known\nof mine.\n15 As the Father knoweth me,\neven so know I the Father: and\nI lay down my life for the\nsheep.\n6 And other sheep I have,\nwhich are not of this fold:\nthem also I must bring, and\nthey shall hear my voice; and\nthere shall be one fold, _and_\none shepherd.\n17 Therefore doth my Father\nlove me, because I lay down my\nlife, that I might take it\nagain.\n18 No man taketh it from me,\nbut I lay it down of myself. I\nhave power to lay it down, and\nI have power to take it again.\nThis commandment have I\nreceived of my Father.\n19 There was a division\ntherefore again among the Jews\nfor these sayings.\n20 And many of them said, He\nhath a devil, and is mad; why\nhear ye him?\n21 Others said, These are not\nthe words of him that hath a\ndevil. Can a devil open the\neyes of the blind?\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 91. Jesus at Jerusalem at the feast of dedication. He retires beyond\nJordan. _Jerusalem. Bethany beyond Jordan_.\n\n\nJohn.\nCH. X. 22-42.\n22 And it was at Jerusalem the\nfeast of the dedication, and\nit was winter.\n23 And Jesus walked in the\ntemple in Solomon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s porch.\n24 Then came the Jews round\nabout him, and said unto him,\nHow long dost thou make us to\ndoubt? If thou be the Christ,\ntell us plainly.\n25 Jesus answered them, I told\nyou, and ye believed not: the\nworks that I do in my Father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nname, they bear witness of me.\n28 But ye believe not, because\nye are not of my sheep, as I\nsaid unto you.\n27 My sheep hear my voice, and\nI know them, and they follow\nme:\n28 And I give unto them\neternal life; and they shall\nnever perish, neither shall\nany pluck them out of my hand.\n29 My Father, which gave\n_them_ me, is greater than\nall; and none is able to pluck\n_them_ out of my Father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand.\n30 I and _my_ Father are one.\n31 Then the Jews took up\nstones again to stone him.\n32 Jesus answered them, Many\ngood works have I shewed you\nfrom my Father; for which of\nthose works do ye stone me?\n33 The Jews answered him,\nsaying, For a good work we\nstone thee not; but for\nblasphemy, and because that\nthou, being a man, makest\nthyself God.\n34 Jesus answered them, Is it\nnot written in your law, I\nsaid, Ye are gods?(214)\n35 If he called them gods,\nunto whom the word of God\ncame, and the scripture cannot\nbe broken;\n36 Say ye of him whom the\nFather hath sanctified, and\nsent into the world, Thou\nblasphemest; because I said, I\nam the Son of God?\n37 If I do not the works of my\nFather, believe me not.\n38 But if I do, though ye\nbelieve not me, believe the\nworks: that ye may know and\nbelieve that the Father _is_\nin me, and I in him.\n39 Therefore they sought again\nto take him; but he escaped\nout of their hand,\n40 And went away again beyond\nJordan, into the place where\nJohn at first baptized; and\nthere he abode.\n41 And many resorted unto him,\nand said, John did no miracle;\nbut all things that John spake\nof this man were true.\n42 And many believed on him\nthere.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 92. The raising of Lazarus. _Bethany_.\n\n\nJohn.\nCH. XI. 1-46.\nNow a certain man was sick,\nnamed Lazarus, of Bethany, the\ntown of Mary and her sister\nMartha.\n2 (It was _that_ Mary which\nanointed the Lord with\nointment, and wiped his feet\nwith her hair, whose brother\nLazarus was sick.)\n3 Therefore his sisters sent\nunto him, saying, Lord,\nbehold, he whom thou lovest is\nsick.\n4 When Jesus heard _that_, he\nsaid, This sickness is not\nunto death, but for the glory\nof God, that the Son of God\nmight be glorified thereby.\n5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and\nher sister, and Lazarus.\n6 When he had heard therefore\nthat he was sick, he abode two\ndays still in the same place\nwhere he was.\n7 Then after that saith he to\n_his_ disciples, Let us go\ninto Judea again.\n8 _His_ disciples say unto\nhim, Master, the Jews of late\nsought to stone thee; and\ngoest thou thither again?\n9 Jesus answered, Are there\nnot twelve hours in the day?\nIf any man walk in the day, he\nstumbleth not, because he\nseeth the light of this world.\n10 But if a man walk in the\nnight, he stumbleth, because\nthere is no light in him.\n11 These things said he: and\nafter that he saith unto them,\nOur friend Lazarus sleepeth;\nbut I go that I may awake him\nout of sleep.\n12 Then said his disciples,\nLord, if he sleep, he shall do\nwell.\n13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his\ndeath: but they thought that\nhe had spoken of taking of\nrest in sleep.\n14 Then said Jesus unto them\nplainly, Lazarus is dead.\n15 And I am glad for your\nsakes that I was not there, to\nthe intent ye may believe;\nnevertheless, let us go unto\nhim.\n16 Then said Thomas, which is\ncalled Didymus, unto his\nfellow-disciples, Let us also\ngo, that we may die with him.\n17 Then when Jesus came, he\nfound that he had _lain_ in\nthe grave four days already.\n18 (Now Bethany was nigh unto\nJerusalem, about fifteen\nfurlongs off:)\n19 And many of the Jews came\nto Martha and Mary, to comfort\nthem concerning their brother.\n20 Then Martha, as soon as she\nheard that Jesus was coming,\nwent and met him: but Mary sat\n_still_ in the house.\n21 Then said Martha unto\nJesus, Lord, if thou hadst\nbeen here, my brother had not\ndied.\n22 But I know that even now,\nwhatsoever thou wilt ask of\nGod, God will give _it_ thee.\n23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy\nbrother shall rise again.\n24 Martha saith unto him, I\nknow that he shall rise again\nin the resurrection at the\nlast day.\n25 Jesus said unto her, I am\nthe resurrection, and the\nlife: he that believeth in me,\nthough he were dead, yet shall\nhe live:\n26 And whosoever liveth, and\nbelieveth in me, shall never\ndie. Believest thou this?\n27 She saith unto him, Yea,\nLord: I believe that thou art\nthe Christ, the Son of God,\nwhich should come into the\nworld.\n28 And when she had so said,\nshe went her way, and called\nMary her sister secretly,\nsaying, The master is come,\nand calleth for thee.\n29 As soon as she heard\n_that_, she arose quickly, and\ncame unto him.\n30 Now Jesus was not yet come\ninto the town, but was in that\nplace where Martha met him.\n31 The Jews then which were\nwith her in the house, and\ncomforted her, when they saw\nMary that she rose up hastily,\nand went out, followed her,\nsaying, She goeth unto the\ngrave to weep there.\n32 Then when Mary was come\nwhere Jesus was, and saw him,\nshe fell down at his feet,\nsaying unto him, Lord, if thou\nhadst been here, my brother\nhad not died.\n33 When Jesus therefore saw\nher weeping, and the Jews also\nweeping which came with her,\nhe groaned in the spirit, and\nwas troubled,\n34 And said, Where have ye\nlaid him? They say unto him,\nLord, come and see.\n36 Jesus wept.\n36 Then said the Jews, Behold\nhow he loved him!\n37 And some of them said,\nCould not this man, which\nopened the eyes of the blind,\nhave caused that even this man\nshould not have died?\n38 Jesus therefore again\ngroaning in himself, cometh to\nthe grave. It was a cave, and\na stone lay upon it.\n39 Jesus said, Take ye away\nthe stone. Martha, the sister\nof him that was dead, saith\nunto him, Lord, by this time\nhe stinketh: for he hath been\n_dead_ four days.\n40 Jesus saith unto her, Said\nI not unto thee, that if thou\nwouldest believe, thou\nshouldest see the glory of\nGod?\n41 Then they took away the\nstone _from the place_ where\nthe dead was laid. And Jesus\nlifted up _his_ eyes, and\nsaid, Father, I thank thee\nthat thou hast heard me.\n42 And I knew that thou\nhearest me always: but because\nof the people which stand by,\nI said _it_, that they may\nbelieve that thou hast sent\nme.\n43 And when he thus had\nspoken, he cried with a loud\nvoice, Lazarus, come forth.\n44 And he that was dead came\nforth, bound hand and foot\nwith graveclothes: and his\nface was bound about with a\nnapkin. Jesus saith unto them,\nLoose him, and let him go.\n45 Then many of the Jews which\ncame to Mary, and had seen the\nthings which Jesus did,\nbelieved on him.\n46 But some of them went their\nways to the Pharisees, and\ntold them what things Jesus\nhad done.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 93.

XI. 47-54.\n47 Then gathered the chief\npriests and the Pharisees a\ncouncil, and said, What do we?\nfor this man doeth many\nmiracles.\n48 If we let him thus alone,\nall _men_ will believe on him:\nand the Romans shall come, and\ntake away both our place and\nnation.\n49 And one of them, _named_\nCaiaphas, being the high\npriest that same year, said\nunto them, Ye know nothing at\nall,\n50 Nor consider that it is\nexpedient for us, that one man\nshould die for the people, and\nthat the whole nation perish\nnot.\n51 And this spake he not of\nhimself: but being high priest\nthat year, he prophesied that\nJesus should die for that\nnation;\n52 And not for that nation\nonly, but that also he should\ngather together in one the\nchildren of God that were\nscattered abroad.\n53 Then from that day forth\nthey took counsel together for\nto put him to death.\n54 Jesus therefore walked no\nmore openly among the Jews;\nbut went thence unto a country\nnear to the wilderness, into a\ncity called Ephraim, and there\ncontinued with his disciples.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 94.

XIII. 10-21.\n10 And he was teaching in one\nof the synagogues on the\nsabbath.\n11 And behold, there was a\nwoman which had a spirit of\ninfirmity eighteen years, and\nwas bowed together, and could\nin no wise lift up _herself_.\n12 And when Jesus saw her, he\ncalled _her to him_, and said\nunto her, Woman, thou art\nloosed from thine infirmity.\n13 And he laid _his_ hands on\nher: and immediately she was\nmade straight, and glorified\nGod.\n14 And the ruler of the\nsynagogue answered with\nindignation, because that\nJesus had healed on the\nsabbath-day, and said unto the\npeople, There are six days in\nwhich men ought to work: in\nthem therefore come and be\nhealed, and not on the\nsabbath-day.\n15 The Lord then answered him,\nand said, _Thou_ hypocrite,\ndoth not each one of you on\nthe sabbath loose his ox or\n_his_ ass from the stall, and\nlead _him_ away to watering?\n16 And ought not this woman,\nbeing a daughter of Abraham,\nwhom Satan hath bound, lo,\nthese eighteen years, be\nloosed from this bond on the\nsabbath-day?\n17 And when he had said these\nthings, all his adversaries\nwere ashamed: and all the\npeople rejoiced for all the\nglorious things that were done\nby him.\n18 Then said he, Unto what is\nthe kingdom of God like? and\nwhereunto shall I resemble it?\n19 It is like a grain of\nmustard-seed which a man took,\nand cast into his garden, and\nit grew, and waxed a great\ntree; and the fowls of the air\nlodged in the branches of it.\n20 And again he said,\nWhereunto shall I liken the\nkingdom of God?\n21 It is like leaven, which a\nwoman took and hid in three\nmeasures of meal, till the\nwhole was leavened.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 95.

And he\ndivided unto them _his_\nliving.\n13 And not many days after,\nthe younger son gathered all\ntogether, and took his journey\ninto a far country, and there\nwasted his substance with\nriotous living.\n14 And when he had spent all,\nthere arose a mighty famine in\nthat land; and he began to be\nin want.\n15 And he went and joined\nhimself to a citizen of that\ncountry; and he sent him into\nhis fields to feed swine.\n16 And he would fain have\nfilled his belly with the\nhusks that the swine did eat;\nand no man gave unto him.\n17 And when he came to\nhimself, he said, How many\nhired servants of my father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhave bread enough and to\nspare, and I perish with\nhunger!\n18 I will arise and go to my\nfather, and will say unto him,\nFather, I have sinned against\nheaven, and before thee,\n19 And am no more worthy to be\ncalled thy son: make me as one\nof thy hired servants.\n20 And he arose, and came to\nhis father. But when he was\nyet a great way off, his\nfather saw him, and had\ncompassion, and ran, and fell\non his neck, and kissed him.\n21 And the son said unto him,\nFather, I have sinned against\nheaven, and in thy sight, and\nam no more worthy to be called\nthy son.\n22 But the father said to his\nservants, Bring forth the best\nrobe, and put it on him; and\nput a ring on his hand, and\nshoes on _his_ feet:\n23 And bring hither the fatted\ncalf, and kill _it_; and let\nus eat, and be merry:\n24 For this my son was dead,\nand is alive again; he _was_\nlost, and is found. And they\nbegan to be merry.\n25 Now his elder son was in\nthe field: and as he came and\ndrew nigh to the house, he\nheard music and dancing.\n26 And he called one of the\nservants, and asked what these\nthings meant.\n27 And he said unto him, Thy\nbrother is come; and thy\nfather hath killed the fatted\ncalf, because he hath received\nhim safe and sound.\n28 And he was angry, and would\nnot go in; therefore came his\nfather out, and entreated him.\n29 And he, answering, said to\n_his_ father, Lo, these many\nyears do I serve thee, neither\ntransgressed I at any time thy\ncommandment; and yet thou\nnever gavest me a kid, that I\nmight make merry with my\nfriends:\n30 But as soon as this thy son\nwas came, which hath devoured\nthy living with harlots, thou\nhast killed for him the fatted\ncalf.\n31 And he said unto him, Son,\nthou art ever with me; and all\nthat I have is thine.\n32 It was meet that we should\nmake merry, and be glad: for\nthis thy brother was dead, and\nis alive again; and was lost,\nand is found.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 99.

And he said\nunto him, Take thy bill, and\nsit down quickly, and write\nfifty.\n7 Then said he to another, And\nhow much owest thou? And he\nsaid, A hundred measures of\nwheat. And he said unto him,\nTake thy bill, and write\nfour-score.\n8 And the lord commended the\nunjust steward, because he had\ndone wisely: for the children\nof this world are in their\ngeneration wiser than the\nchildren of light.\n9 And I say unto you, Make to\nyourselves friends of the\nmammon of unrighteousness;\nthat when ye fail, they may\nreceive you into everlasting\nhabitations.\n10 He that is faithful in that\nwhich is least, is faithful\nalso in much; and he that is\nunjust in the least, is unjust\nalso in much.\n11 If therefore ye have not\nbeen faithful in the\nunrighteous mammon, who will\ncommit to your trust the true\n_riches_?\n12 And if ye have not been\nfaithful in that which is\nanother man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, who shall give\nyou that which is your own?\n13 No servant can serve two\nmasters: for either he will\nhate the one, and love the\nother; or else he will hold to\nthe one, and despise the\nother.

Now when Simon\n                                 Peter heard that it was the\n                                 Lord, he girt _his_ fisher\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n                                 coat _unto him_, (for he was\n                                 naked) and did cast himself\n                                 into the sea.\n                                 8 And the other disciples came\n                                 in a little ship (for they\n                                 were not far from land, but as\n                                 it were two hundred cubits)\n                                 dragging the net with fishes.\n                                 9 As soon then as they were\n                                 come to land, they saw a fire\n                                 of coals there, and fish laid\n                                 thereon, and bread.\n                                 10 Jesus saith unto them,\n                                 bring of the fish which ye\n                                 have now caught.\n                                 11 Simon Peter went up, and\n                                 drew the net to land full of\n                                 great fishes, an hundred and\n                                 fifty and three: and for all\n                                 there were so many, yet was\n                                 not the net broken.\n                                 12 Jesus saith unto them, Come\n                                 _and_ dine. And none of the\n                                 disciples durst ask him, Who\n                                 art thou? knowing that it was\n                                 the Lord.\n                                 13 Jesus then cometh, and\n                                 taketh bread, and giveth them,\n                                 and fish likewise.\n                                 14 This is now the third time\n                                 that Jesus shewed himself to\n                                 his disciples, after that he\n                                 was risen from the dead.\n                                 15 So when they had dined,\n                                 Jesus saith to Simon Peter,\n                                 Simon, _son_ of Jonas, lovest\n                                 thou me more than these? He\n                                 saith unto him, Yea, Lord:\n                                 thou knowest that I love thee.\n                                 He saith unto him, Feed my\n                                 lambs.\n                                 16 He saith to him again the\n                                 second time, Simon, _son_ of\n                                 Jonas, lovest thou me? He\n                                 saith unto him, Yea, Lord:\n                                 thou knowest that I love thee.\n                                 He saith unto him, Feed my\n                                 sheep.\n                                 17 He saith unto him the third\n                                 time, Simon, _son_ of Jonas,\n                                 lovest thou me? Peter was\n                                 grieved because he said unto\n                                 him the third time, Lovest\n                                 thou me? And he said unto him,\n                                 Lord, thou knowest all things;\n                                 thou knowest that I love thee.\n                                 Jesus saith unto him, Feed my\n                                 sheep.\n                                 18 Verily, verily, I say unto\n                                 thee, When thou wast young,\n                                 thou girdest thyself, and\n                                 walkedst whither thou\n                                 wouldest: but when thou shalt\n                                 be old, thou shalt stretch\n                                 forth thy hands, and another\n                                 shall gird thee, and carry\n                                 _thee_ whither thou wouldest\n                                 not.\n                                 19 This spake he, signifying\n                                 by what death he should\n                                 glorify God. And when he had\n                                 spoken this, he saith unto\n                                 him, Follow me.\n                                 20 Then Peter, turning about,\n                                 seeth the disciple whom Jesus\n                                 loved, following; (which also\n                                 leaned on his breast at\n                                 supper, and said, Lord, which\n                                 is he that betrayeth thee?)\n                                 21 Peter seeing him, saith to\n                                 Jesus, Lord, and what _shall_\n                                 this man _do_?\n                                 22 Jesus saith unto him, if I\n                                 will that he tarry till I\n                                 come, what _is that_ to thee?\n                                 Follow thou me.\n                                 23 Then went this saying\n                                 abroad among the brethren,\n                                 that that disciple should not\n                                 die: yet Jesus said not unto\n                                 him, He shall not die; but, if\n                                 I will that he tarry till I\n                                 come, what _is that_ to thee?\n                                 24 This is the disciple which\n                                 testifieth of these things,\n                                 and wrote these things: and we\n                                 know that his testimony is\n                                 true.\n\n\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 170.

As the\nbest service the present writer could do to the English reader, he has\ntherefore here abridged that article, by omitting the introduction, and\nsuch parts as relate to the Greek text, and a few other passages, which it\nseemed might be spared without injury to the narrative itself.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 1. _The Time of the Resurrection._\n\nMatt. 26: 1, 2.  Mark 16: 1, 2, 9.  Luke 24: 1.  John 20: 1.\n\nThat the resurrection of our Lord took place before full daylight, on the\nfirst day of the week, follows from the unanimous testimony of the\nEvangelists respecting the visit of the women to the sepulchre. But the\nexact time at which he rose is nowhere specified. According to the Jewish\nmode of reckoning, the Sabbath ended and the next day began at sunset; so\nthat had the resurrection occurred even before midnight, it would still\nhave been upon the first day of the week, and the third day after our\nLord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burial. The earthquake had taken place and the stone had been\nrolled away before the arrival of the women; and so far as the immediate\nnarrative is concerned, there is nothing to show that all this might not\nhave happened some hours earlier. Yet the words of Mark in another place\nrender it certain, that there could have been no great interval between\nthese events and the arrival of the women; since he affirms in v. 9, that\nJesus \u00e2\u0080\u009chad risen _early_, the first day of the week;\u00e2\u0080\u009d while in v. 2, he\nstates that the women went out \u00e2\u0080\u009c_very early_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A like inference may be\ndrawn from the fact, that the affrighted guards first went to inform the\nchief priests of these events, when the women returned to the city (Matt.\n28: 11); for it is hardly to be supposed, that after having been thus\nterrified by the earthquake and the appearance of an angel, they would\nhave waited any very long time before sending information to their\nemployers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The body of Jesus had therefore probably lain in the tomb not\nless than about thirty-six hours.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 2. _The Visit of the Women to the Sepulchre._\n\nMatt. 28: 1-8. Mark 16: 1-8. Luke 24: 1-11. John 20: 1, 2.\n\nThe first notices we have of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resurrection, are connected with\nthe visit of the women to the sepulchre, on the morning of the first day\nof the week. According to Luke, the women who had stood by the cross, went\nhome and rested during the sabbath (23:56); and Mark adds that after the\nsabbath was ended, that is, after sunset, and during the evening, they\nprepared spices in order to go and embalm our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body. They were\neither not aware of the previous embalming by Joseph and Nicodemus; or\nelse they also wished to testify their respect and affection to their\nLord, by completing, more perfectly, what before had been done in haste;\nJohn 19: 40-42.\n\nIt is in just this portion of the history, which relates to the visit of\nthe women to the tomb and the appearance of Jesus to them, that most of\nthe alleged difficulties and discrepancies in this part of the Gospel\nnarratives are found. We will therefore take up the chief of them in their\norder.\n\nI. _The Time_. All the Evangelists agree in saying that the women went out\n_very early_ to the sepulchre. Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expression is, _as the day was\ndawning_. Mark\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words are, _very early_: which indeed are less definite,\nbut are appropriate to denote the same point of time. Luke has the more\npoetic term: _deep morning_, i. e. early dawn. John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s language is likewise\ndefinite: _early, while it was yet dark_. All these expressions go to fix\nthe time at what we call _early dawn_, or _early twilight_; after the\nbreak of day, but while the light is yet struggling with darkness.\n\nThus far there is no difficulty; and none would ever arise, had not Mark\nadded the phrase, _the sun being risen_; or, as the English version has\nit, _at the rising of the sun_. These words seem, at first, to be at\ndirect variance both with the _very early_ of Mark himself, and with the\nlanguage of the other Evangelists. To harmonise this apparent discrepancy,\nwe may premise, that since Mark himself first specifies the point of time\nby a phrase sufficiently definite in itself, and supported by all the\nother Evangelists, we must conclude that when he adds, _at the rising of\nthe sun_, he did not mean to contradict himself, but used this latter\nphrase in a broader and less definite sense. As the sun is the source of\nlight and of the day, and as his earliest rays produce the contrast\nbetween darkness and light, between night and dawn, so the term sunrising\nmight easily come in popular language, by a metonymy of cause for effect,\nto be put for all that earlier interval, when his rays, still struggling\nwith darkness, do nevertheless usher in the day.\n\nAccordingly, we find such a popular usage prevailing among the Hebrews;\nand several instances of it occur in the Old Testament. Thus in Judg. 9:\n33, the message of Zebul to Abimelech, after directing him to lie in wait\nwith his people in the field during the night, goes on as follows: \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it\nshall be, in the morning, as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early\nand set upon the city;\u00e2\u0080\u009d yet we cannot for a moment suppose that Abimelech\nwith his ambuscade was to wait until the sun actually appeared above the\nhorizon, before he made his onset. So the Psalmist (104: 22), speaking of\nthe young lions that by night roar after their prey, goes on to say: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe\nsun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their\ndens.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But wild animals do not wait for the actual appearance of the sun\nere they shrink away to their lairs; the break of day, the dawning light,\nis the signal for their retreat. See also Sept. 2 K. 3:22. 2 Sam. 23:4. In\nall these passages the language is entirely parallel to that of Mark; and\nthey serve fully to illustrate the principle, that the rising of the sun\nis here used in a popular sense as equivalent to the _rising of the day_\nor early dawn.\n\nII. _The Number of the Women._ Matthew mentions Mary Magdalene and the\nother Mary; v. 1. Mark enumerates Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of\nJames, and Salome; v. 1. Luke has Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother\nof James, and others with them; v. 10. John speaks of Mary Magdalene\nalone, and says nothing of any other. The first three Evangelists accord\nthen in respect to the two Marys, but no further; while John differs from\nthem all. Is there here a real discrepancy?\n\nWe may at once answer, No; because, according to the sound canon of Le\nClerc:(312) \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Qui plura narrat, pauciora complectitur; qui pauciora\nmemorat, plura non negat._\u00e2\u0080\u009d Because John, in narrating circumstances with\nwhich he was personally connected, sees fit to mention only Mary\nMagdalene, it does not at all follow that others were not present. Because\nMatthew, perhaps for like reasons, speaks only of the two Marys, he by no\nmeans excludes the presence of others. Indeed, the very words which John\nputs into the mouth of Mary Magdalene, (v. 2), presupposes the fact, that\nothers had gone with her to the sepulchre. That there was something in\nrespect to Mary Magdalene, which gave her a peculiar prominence in these\ntransactions, may be inferred from the fact, that not only John mentions\nher alone, but likewise all the other Evangelists name her first, as if\nholding the most conspicuous place.\n\nThe instance here under consideration is parallel to that of the demoniacs\nof Gadara, and the blind men at Jericho; where, in both cases, Matthew\nspeaks of two persons, while Mark and Luke mention only one.(313)\nSomething peculiar in the station or character of one of the persons,\nrendered him in each case more prominent, and led the two latter\nEvangelists to speak of him particularly. But there, as here, their\nlanguage is not exclusive; nor is there in it anything that contradicts\nthe statements of Matthew.\n\nIII. _The Arrival at the Sepulchre._ According to Mark, Luke, and John,\nthe women on reaching the sepulchre found the great stone, with which it\nhad been closed, already rolled away. Matthew, on the other hand, after\nnarrating that the women went out to see the sepulchre, proceeds to\nmention the earthquake, the descent of the angel, his rolling away the\nstone and sitting upon it, and the terror of the watch, as if all these\nthings took place in the presence of the women. The angel too (in v. 5)\naddresses the women, as if still sitting upon the stone he had rolled\naway.\n\nThe apparent discrepancy, if any, here arises simply from Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbrevity in omitting to state in full what his own narrative presupposes.\nAccording to v. 6, Christ was already risen; and therefore the earthquake\nand its accompaniments must have taken place at an earlier point of time,\nto which the sacred writer returns back in his narration. And although\nMatthew does not represent the women as entering the sepulchre, yet in v.\n8, he speaks of them as going out of it; so that of course their interview\nwith the angel took place, not outside of the sepulchre, but in it, as\nnarrated by the other Evangelists. When therefore the angel says to them\nin v. 6, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, see the place where the Lord lay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d this is not said\nwithout the tomb to induce them to enter, as Strauss avers; but within the\nsepulchre, just as in Mark v. 6.\n\nIV. _The Vision of Angels in the Sepulchre._ Of this John says nothing.\nMatthew and Mark speak of one angel; Luke of two. Mark says he was\nsitting; Luke speaks of them as standing. This difference in respect to\nnumbers is parallel to the case of the women, which we have just\nconsidered; and requires therefore no further illustration.\n\nThere is likewise some diversity in the language addressed to the women by\nthe angels. In Matthew and Mark, the prominent object is the charge to the\ndisciples to depart into Galilee. In Luke this is not referred to; but the\nwomen are reminded of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own previous declaration, that he would\nrise again on the third day. Neither of the Evangelists here professes to\nreport _all_ that was said by the angels; and of course there is no room\nfor contradiction.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 3. _The return of the Women to the city, and the first appearance of our\nLord._\n\nMatt. 28: 7-10. Mark 16: 8. Luke 24: 9-11. John 20: 1, 2.\n\nJohn, speaking of Mary Magdalene alone, says that having seen that the\nstone was taken away from the sepulchre, she went in haste (ran) to tell\nPeter and John. He says nothing of her having seen the angels, nor of her\nhaving entered the sepulchre at all. The other Evangelists, speaking of\nthe women generally, relate that they entered the tomb, saw the angels and\nthen returned into the city. On their way Jesus meets them. They recognize\nhim; fall at and embrace his feet; and receive his charge to the\ndisciples.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Was Mary Magdalene now with the other women? Or did she enter\nthe city by another way? Or had she left the sepulchre before the rest?\n\nIt is evident that Mary Magdalene was not with the other women when Jesus\nthus met them. Her language to Peter and John forbids the supposition,\nthat she had already seen the Lord: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey have taken away the Lord out of\nthe sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She therefore\nmust have entered the city by another path and gate; or else have left the\nsepulchre before the rest; or possibly both these positions may be true.\nShe bore her tidings expressly to Peter and John, who would seem to have\nlodged by themselves in a different quarter of the city; while the other\nwomen went apparently to the rest of the disciples. But this supposition\nof a different route is essential, only in connection with the view, that\nshe left the tomb with the other women. That, however, she actually\ndeparted from the sepulchre before her companions, would seem most\nprobable; inasmuch as she speaks to Peter and John only of the absence of\nthe Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body; says nothing in this connection of a vision of angels;\nand when, after returning again to the tomb, she sees the angels, it is\nevidently for the first time; and she repeats to them as the cause of her\ngrief her complaint as to the disappearance of the body; John 20: 12, 13.\nShe may have turned back from the tomb without entering it at all, so soon\nas she saw that it was open; inferring from the removal of the stone, that\nthe sepulchre had been rifled. Or, she may first have entered with the\nrest, when, according to Luke, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey found not the body of the Lord\nJesus,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cwere much perplexed thereabout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d before the angels became\nvisible to them. The latter supposition seems best to meet the exigencies\nof the case.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs the other women went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,\nsaying, All hail. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worshipped\nhim. Then Jesus said unto them, Be not afraid; go, tell my brethren, that\nthey go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The women had left the\nsepulchre \u00e2\u0080\u009cwith fear and great joy\u00e2\u0080\u009d after the declaration of the angels\nthat Christ was risen; or, as Mark has it, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey trembled and were\namazed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jesus meets them with words of gentleness to quiet their terrors;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBe not afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He permits them to approach, and embrace his feet, and\ntestify their joy and homage. He reiterates to them the message of the\nangels to his \u00e2\u0080\u009cbrethren,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the eleven disciples; see v. 16.\n\nThis appearance and interview is narrated only by Matthew; none of the\nother Evangelists give any hint of it. Matthew here stops short. Mark\nsimply relates that the women fled from the tomb; \u00e2\u0080\u009cneither said they\nanything to any one, for they were afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This of course can only mean,\nthat they spoke of what they had thus seen to no one while on their way to\nthe city; for the very charge of the angels, which they went to fulfil,\nwas, that they should \u00e2\u0080\u009cgo their way and tell his disciples;\u00e2\u0080\u009d v. 7. Luke\nnarrates more fully, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey returned from the sepulchre, and told all\nthese things unto the eleven, and to all the rest.\u00e2\u0080\u0094And their words seemed\nto them as idle tales, and they believed them not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d We may perhaps see in\nthis language one reason why the other Evangelists have omitted to mention\nthis appearance of our Lord. The disciples _disbelieved the report of the\nwomen_, that they had seen Jesus. In like manner they afterwards\ndisbelieved the report of Mary Magdalene to the same effect; Mark 16: 11.\nThey were ready, it would seem, to admit the testimony of the women to the\nabsence of the body, and to the vision of angels; but not to the\nresurrection of Jesus and his appearance to them; Luke 24: 21-24. And\nafterwards, when the eleven had become convinced by the testimony of their\nown senses, those first two appearances to the women became of less\nimportance and were less regarded. Hence the silence of three Evangelists\nas to the one; of two as to the other; and of Paul as to both; 1 Cor. 15:\n5, 6.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 4. _Peter and John visit the Sepulchre. Jesus appears to Mary\nMagdalene._\n\nJohn 20: 3-18. Luke 24: 12. Mark 16: 9-11.\n\nThe full account of these two events is given solely by John. Matthew has\nnot a word of either; Luke merely mentions, in general, that Peter, on the\nreport of the women, went to the sepulchre; while Mark speaks only of our\nLord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance to Mary Magdalene, which he seems to represent as his\n_first_ appearance.\n\nAccording to John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account, Peter and the beloved disciple, excited by\nthe tidings of Mary Magdalene that the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body had been taken away,\nhasten to the sepulchre. They run; John outruns Peter, comes first to the\ntomb, and stooping down, sees the grave-clothes lying, but he does not\nenter. The other women are no longer at the tomb; nor have the disciples\nmet them on the way. Peter now comes up; he enters the the tomb, and sees\nthe grave-clothes lying, and the napkin that was about his head not lying\nwith the rest, but wrapped together in a place by itself. John too now\nenters the sepulchre; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand he saw and believed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhat was it that John thus believed? The mere report of Mary Magdalene,\nthat the body had been removed? So much he must have believed when he\nstooped down and looked into the sepulchre. For this, there was no need\nthat he should enter the tomb. His belief must have been of something more\nand greater. The grave-clothes lying orderly in their place, and the\nnapkin folded together by itself, made it evident that the sepulchre had\nnot been rifled nor the body stolen by violent hands; for these garments\nand spices would have been of more value to thieves, than merely a naked\ncorpse; at least, they would not have taken the trouble thus to fold them\ntogether. The same circumstances showed also that the body had not been\nremoved by friends; for they would not thus have left the grave-clothes\nbehind. All these considerations produce in the mind of John the germ of a\nbelief that Jesus was risen from the dead. He believed _because_ he saw;\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_for_ as yet they knew not the Scripture;\u00e2\u0080\u009d (v. 9). He now began more\nfully to recall and understand our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s repeated declaration, that he\nwas to rise again on the third day;(314) a declaration on which the Jews\nhad already acted in setting a watch.(315) In this way, the difficulty\nwhich is sometimes urged of an apparent want of connection between verses\n8 and 9, disappears.\n\nThe two disciples went their way, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwondering in themselves at what was\ncome to pass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mary Magdalene who had followed them back to the sepulchre,\nremained before it weeping. While she thus wept, she too, like John,\nstooped down and looked in, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand seeth two angels, in white, sitting, the\none at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had\nlain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To their inquiry why she wept, her reply was the same report which\nshe had before borne to the two disciples: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause they have taken away\nmy Lord, and I know not where they have laid him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d v. 13. Of the angels we\nlearn nothing further. The whole character of this representation seems to\nshow clearly, that Mary had not before seen the angels; and also that she\nhad not before been told, that Jesus was risen. We must otherwise regard\nher as having been in a most unaccountably obtuse and unbelieving frame of\nmind; the very contrary of which seems to have been the fact. If also she\nhad before informed the two disciples of a vision of angels and of\nChrist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resurrection, it is difficult to see, why John should omit to\nmention this circumstance, so important and so personal to himself.\n\nAfter replying to the angels, Mary turns herself about, and sees a person\nstanding near, whom, from his being present there, she takes to be the\nkeeper of the garden. He too inquires, why she weeps. Her reply is the\nsame as before; except that she, not unnaturally, supposes him to have\nbeen engaged in removing the body, which she desires to recover. He simply\nutters in reply, in well-known tones, the name Mary! and the whole truth\nflashes upon her soul; doubt is dispelled, and faith triumphs. She\nexclaims: \u00e2\u0080\u009cRabboni!\u00e2\u0080\u009d as much as to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy dearest Master!\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\napparently, like the other women,(316) falls at his feet in order to\nembrace and worship him. This Jesus forbids her to do, in these remarkable\nwords: \u00e2\u0080\u009cTouch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my\nbrethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and\nto my God and your God;\u00e2\u0080\u009d v. 17.\n\nThere remains to be considered the circumstance, that Mark, in v. 9, seems\nto represent this appearance of Jesus at the sepulchre to Mary Magdalene,\nas his first appearance: \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, being risen early the first of the week, he\nappeared _first_ to Mary Magdalene.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In attempting to harmonize this with\nMatthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance to the other women on their\nreturn from the sepulchre, several methods have been adopted; but the most\nto the purpose is the view which regards the word _first_, in Mark v. 9,\nas put not absolutely, but relatively. That is to say, Mark narrates\nthree, and only three, appearances of our Lord; _of these three_, that to\nMary Magdalene takes place _first_, and that to the assembled disciples\nthe same evening occurs _last_, v. 14. A similar example occurs in 1 Cor.\n15: 5-8, where Paul enumerates those to whom the Lord showed himself after\nhis resurrection, viz. to Peter, to the twelve, to five hundred brethren,\nto James, to all the apostles, and _last of all_ to Paul also. Now had\nPaul written here, as with strict propriety he might have done, \u00e2\u0080\u009che was\nseen _first_ of Cephas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d assuredly no one would ever have understood him\nas intending to assert that the appearance to Peter was the first\nabsolutely; that is, as implying that Jesus was seen of Peter before he\nappeared to Mary Magdalene and the other women. In like manner when John\ndeclares (21: 14) that Jesus showed himself to his disciples by the lake\nof Galilee for the _third_ time after he was risen from the dead; this is\nsaid relatively to the two previous appearances to the assembled apostles;\nand does by no means exclude the four still earlier appearances, viz. to\nPeter, to the two at Emmaus, to Mary Magdalene, and to the other\nwomen,\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of which John himself relates in full.\n\nIn this way the old difficulty in the case before us disappears; and the\ncomplex and cumbrous machinery of earlier commentators becomes\nsuperfluous.\n\nAfter her interview with Jesus, Mary Magdalene returns to the city, and\ntells the disciples that she had seen the Lord and that he had spoken\nthese things unto her. According to Mark (vs. 10, 11), the disciples were\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cmourning and weeping;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and when the heard that Jesus was alive and had\nbeen seen of her, they believed not.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 5. _Jesus appears to two disciples on the way to Emmaus. Also to Peter._\n\nLuke 24: 13-35. Mark 16: 12, 13. 1 Cor. 15: 5.\n\nThis appearance on the way to Emmaus is related in full only by Luke. Mark\nmerely notes the fact; while the other two Evangelists and Paul (1 Cor.\n15: 5) make no mention of it.\n\nOn the afternoon of the same day on which our Lord arose, two of his\ndisciples, one of them named Cleopas, were on their way on foot to a\nvillage called Emmaus, sixty stadia or seven and a half Roman miles\ndistant from Jerusalem,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a walk of some two or two and a half hours. They\nhad heard and credited the tidings brought by the women, and also by Peter\nand John, that the sepulchre was open and empty; and that the women had\nalso seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive. They had most\nprobably likewise heard the reports of Mary Magdalene and the other women,\nthat Jesus himself had appeared to them; but these they did not regard,\nand do not mention them (v. 24); because they, like the other disciples,\nhad looked upon them \u00e2\u0080\u009cas idle tales, and they believed them not;\u00e2\u0080\u009d v. 11.\nAs they went, they were sad, and talked together of all these things which\nhad happened. After some time Jesus himself drew near and went with them.\nBut they knew him not. Mark says he was in another form; Luke affirms that\n\u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir eyes were holden, that they should not know him;\u00e2\u0080\u009d v. 16. Was there\nin this anything miraculous? The \u00e2\u0080\u009canother form\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Mark, Doddridge\nexplains by \u00e2\u0080\u009ca different habit from what he ordinarily wore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His\ngarments, of course, were not his former ones; and this was probably one\nreason why Mary Magdalene had before taken him for the keeper of the\ngarden.(317) It may be, too, that these two disciples had not been\nintimately acquainted with the Lord. He had arrived at Jerusalem only six\ndays before his crucifixion; and these might possibly have been recent\nconverts, who had not before seen him. To such, the change of garments,\nand the unexpectedness of the meeting, would render a recognition more\ndifficult; nor could it be regarded as surprising, that under such\ncircumstances they should not know him. Still, all this is hypothesis; and\nthe averment of Luke, that \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir eyes were holden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the manner of our\nLord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parting from them afterwards, seem more naturally to imply that the\nidea of a supernatural agency, affecting not Jesus himself, but the eyes\nor minds of the two disciples, was in the mind of the sacred writer.\n\nJesus inquires the cause of their sadness; chides them for their slowness\nof heart to believe what the prophets had spoken; and then proceeds to\nexpound unto them \u00e2\u0080\u009cin all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThey feel the power of his words; and their hearts burn within them. By\nthis time they drew nigh to the village whither they went; it was toward\nevening, and the day was far spent. Their journey was ended; and Jesus was\nabout to depart from them. In accordance with oriental hospitality they\nconstrained him to remain with them. He consents; and as he sat at meat\nwith them, he took bread, and blessed and brake, and gave unto them. At\nthis time, and in connection with this act, their eyes were opened; they\nknew him; and he vanished away from them. Here too the question is raised,\nwhether the language necessarily implies anything miraculous? Our English\ntranslators have rendered this passage in the margin, \u00e2\u0080\u009che ceased to be\nseen of them;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and have referred to Luke 4: 30, and John 8: 59, as\nillustrating this idea. They might also have referred to Acts 8: 39.\nStill, the language is doubtless such as the sacred writers would most\nnaturally have employed in order directly to express the idea of\nsupernatural agency.\n\nFull of wonder and joy, the two disciples set off the same hour and return\nto Jerusalem. They find the eleven and other disciples assembled; and as\nthey enter, they are met with the joyful exclamation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Lord is risen\nindeed, and hath appeared unto Simon;\u00e2\u0080\u009d v. 34.  They then rehearse what had\nhappened to themselves; but, according to Mark, the rest believed them\nnot. As in the case of the women, so here, there would seem to have been\nsomething in the position or character of these two disciples, which led\nthe others to give less credit to their testimony, than to that of Peter,\none of the leading apostles.\n\nThis appearance to Peter is mentioned by no other Evangelist; and we know\nnothing of the particular time, nor of the attending circumstances. It\nwould seem to have taken place either not long before, or else shortly\nafter, that to the two disciples. It had not happened when they left\nJerusalem for Emmaus; or, at least, they had not heard of it. It had\noccurred when they returned; and that long enough before to have been\nfully reported to all the disciples and believed by them. It may perhaps\nhave happened about the time when the two disciples set off, or shortly\nafterwards.\n\nPaul, in enumerating those by whom the Lord was seen after his\nresurrection (1 Cor. 15: 5), mentions Peter first; passing over the\nappearances to the women, and also that to the two disciples; probably\nbecause they did not belong among the apostles.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 6. _Jesus appears to the Apostles in the absence of Thomas; and\nafterwards when Thomas is present._\n\nMark 16: 14-18. Luke 24: 36-48. John 20: 19-29. 1 Cor. 15: 5.\n\nThe narrative of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first appearance to the apostles is most fully\ngiven by Luke: John adds a few circumstances; and Mark, as well as Luke,\nhas preserved the first charge thus privately given to the apostles, to\npreach the Gospel in all the world,\u00e2\u0080\u0094a charge afterwards repeated in a more\npublic and solemn manner on the mountain in Galilee. When Paul says the\nLord appeared to _the twelve_, he obviously employs this number as being\nthe usual designation of the apostles; and very probably includes both the\noccasion narrated in this section. Mark and Luke speak in like manner of\n_the eleven_; and yet we know from John, that Thomas was not at first\namong them; so that of course only _ten_ were actually present.\n\nAccording to Mark, the disciples were at their evening meal; which implies\na not very late hour. John says the doors were shut, for fear of the Jews.\nWhile the two who had returned from Emmaus were still recounting what had\nhappened unto them, Jesus himself \u00e2\u0080\u009ccame and stood in the midst of them,\nand saith unto them, Peace be unto you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The question here again is\nraised, whether this entrance of our Lord was miraculous? That it might\nhave been so, there is no reason to doubt. He who in the days of his flesh\nwalked upon the waters, and before whose angel the iron gate of the prison\nopened of its own accord so that Peter might pass out; he who was himself\njust risen from the dead; might well in same miraculous way present\nhimself to his followers in spite of bolts and bars. But does the language\nhere necessarily imply a miracle? The doors indeed were shut; but the word\nused does not of itself signify that they were bolted or fastened. The\nobject no doubt was, to prevent access to spies from the Jews; or also to\nguard themselves from the danger of being arrested; and both these objects\nmight perhaps have been as effectually accomplished by a watch at or\nbefore the door. Nor do the words used of our Lord strictly indicate\nanything miraculous. We do not find here a form of the word commonly\nemployed to express the sudden appearance of angels; but, \u00e2\u0080\u009che _came_ and\nstood in the midst of them;\u00e2\u0080\u009d implying _per se_ nothing more than the\nordinary mode of approach. There is, in fact, nothing in the whole account\nto suggest a miracle, except the remark of John respecting the doors; and\nas this circumstance is not mentioned either by Mark or Luke, it may be\ndoubtful whether we are necessarily compelled by the language to regard\nthe mode of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance as miraculous.\n\nAt this interview Thomas was not present. On his return the other\ndisciples relate to him the circumstances. But Thomas now disbelieved the\nothers; as they before had disbelieved the women. His reply was, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept I\nshall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the\nprint of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nOur Lord had compassion upon his perverseness. Eight days afterwards, when\nthe disciples were again assembled and Thomas with them, our Lord came as\nbefore, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you! He permits to\nThomas the test he had demanded; and charges him to be not faithless, but\nbelieving. Thomas, convinced and abashed, exclaims in the fulness of faith\nand joy, My Lord and my God! recognising and acknowledging thereby the\ndivine nature thus manifested in the flesh. The reply of our Lord to\nThomas is strikingly impressive and condemnatory of his want of faith:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are they\nthat have not seen, and yet have believed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He and the other disciples,\nwho were to be the heralds of the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resurrection to the world as the\nfoundation of the hope of the Gospel, refused to believe except upon the\nevidence of their own senses; while all who after them have borne the\nChristian Name, have believed this great fact of the Gospel solely upon\ntheir testimony. God has overruled their unbelief for good, in making it a\npowerful argument for the truth of their testimony in behalf of this great\nfact, which they themselves were so slow to believe. Blessed, indeed, are\nthey who have received their testimony.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 7. _Our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Appearance in Galilee._\n\nJohn 21: 1-24. Matt. 28: 16-20. 1 Cor. 15: 6.\n\nIt appears from the narrative of Matthew, that while the disciples were\nyet in Jerusalem, our Lord had appointed a time, when he would meet them\nin Galilee, upon a certain mountain.(318) They therefore left Jerusalem\nafter the passover, probably soon after the interview at which Thomas was\npresent, and returned to Galilee, their home. While waiting for the\nappointed time, they engaged in their usual occupation of fishermen. On a\ncertain day, as John relates, towards evening, seven of them being\ntogether, including Peter, Thomas, and the sons of Zebedee, they put out\nupon the lake with their nets in a fishing boat; but during the whole\nnight they caught nothing. At early dawn Jesus stood upon the shore, from\nwhich they were not far off, and directed them to cast the net upon the\nright side of the boat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey cast therefore, and now they were not able\nto draw it for the multitude of the fishes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Recognising in this miracle\ntheir risen Lord, they pressed around him. Peter, with his characteristic\nardour, threw himself into the water in order to reach him the sooner. At\ntheir Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command they prepared a meal from the fish they had thus\ntaken. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus then cometh and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish\nlikewise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This was his third appearance to the eleven; or rather to a\nlarge number of them together. It was on this occasion, and after their\nmeal, that our Lord put to Peter the touching and thrice repeated\nquestion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cLovest thou me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt length the set time arrived; and the eleven disciples went away into\nthe mountain \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhere Jesus had appointed them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It would seem most\nprobable, that this time and place had been appointed of our Lord for a\nsolemn and more public interview, not only with the eleven, whom he had\nalready met, but with all his disciples in Galilee; and that therefore it\nwas on this same occasion, when, according to Paul, \u00e2\u0080\u009che was seen of above\nfive hundred brethren at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(319) That the interview was not confined\nto the eleven alone, would seem evident from the fact that \u00e2\u0080\u009csome doubted;\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nfor this could hardly be supposed true of any of the eleven, after what\nhad already happened to them in Jerusalem and Galilee, and after having\nbeen appointed to meet their risen Lord at this very time and place. The\nappearance of the five hundred must at any rate be referred to Galilee;\nfor even after our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ascension, the number of the names in Jerusalem\nwere together only about an hundred and twenty.(320) I do not hesitate,\ntherefore, to hold with Flatt, Olshausen, Hengstenberg, and others, that\nthe appearances thus described by Matthew and Paul, were identical. It was\na great and solemn occasion. Our Lord had directed that the eleven and all\nhis disciples in Galilee should thus be convened upon the mountain. It was\nthe closing scene of his ministry in Galilee. Here his life had been\nspent. Here most of his mighty works had been done and his discourses\nheld. Here his followers were as yet most numerous. He therefore here\ntakes leave on earth of those among whom he had lived and laboured\nlongest; and repeats to all his disciples in public the solemn charge,\nwhich he had already given in private to the apostles: \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo ye therefore\nand teach all nations:\u00e2\u0080\u0094and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of\nthe world.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was doubtless his last interview with his disciples in that\nregion,\u00e2\u0080\u0094his last great act in Galilee.\n\n\u00c2\u00a7 8. _Our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s further Appearances at Jerusalem, and his Ascension._\n\n1 Cor. 15: 7. Acts 1: 3-12. Luke 24: 49-53. Mark 16: 19, 20.\n\nLuke relates, in Acts 1: 3, that Jesus showed himself alive to his\napostles, \u00e2\u0080\u009cafter his passion, by many infallible proofs, being seen of\nthem forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of\nGod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This would seem to imply interviews and communications, as to which\nwe have little more than this very general notice. One of these may have\nbeen the appearance to James, mentioned by Paul alone (1 Cor. 15: 7), as\nsubsequent to that to the five hundred brethren. It may be referred with\nmost probability to Jerusalem, after the return of the Apostles from\nGalilee. That this return took place by the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction, there can be\nno doubt; although none of the Evangelists have given us the slightest\nhint as to any such direction. Indeed, it is this very brevity,\u00e2\u0080\u0094this\nomission to place on record the minor details which might serve to connect\nthe great facts and events of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last forty days on earth, that\nhas occasioned all the doubt and difficulty with which this portion of the\nwritten history of these events has been encompassed.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The James here\nintended was probably our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother; who was of high consideration in\nthe church, and is often, in the latter books, simply so named without any\nspecial designation.(321) At the time when Paul wrote, the other James,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe brother of John,\u00e2\u0080\u009d as he is called, was already dead.(322)\n\nAfter thus appearing to James, our Lord, according to Paul, was seen \u00e2\u0080\u009cof\nall the apostles.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This, too, was apparently an appointed meeting; and was\ndoubtless the same of which Luke speaks, as occurring in Jerusalem\nimmediately preceding the ascension. It was, of course, the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last\ninterview with his apostles. He repeats to them the promise of the baptism\nwith the Holy Spirit as soon to take place; and charges them not to depart\nfrom Jerusalem until this should be accomplished.(323) Strange as it may\nappear, the twelve, in this last solemn moment, put to him the question,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d How, indeed,\nwere they to believe! Their gross and darkened minds, not yet enlightened\nby the baptism of the Spirit, clung still to the idea of a temporal Prince\nand Saviour, who should deliver his people, not from their sins, but from\nthe galling yoke of Roman dominion. Our Lord deals gently with their\nignorance and want of faith: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not for you to know the times and\nseasons;\u00e2\u0080\u0094but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you;\nand ye shall be witnesses unto me\u00e2\u0080\u0094unto the uttermost part of the earth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDuring this discourse, or in immediate connection with it, our Lord leads\nthem out _as far as to_ Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them;\nLuke 24: 50. This act of blessing must be understood, by all the laws of\nlanguage, as having taken place at or near Bethany. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it came to pass,\n_while_ he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into\nheaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ascension, then, took place at or near Bethany.\nIndeed, the sacred writer could hardly have found words to express this\nfact more definitely and fully; and a doubt on this point could never have\nsuggested itself to the mind of any reader, but for the language of the\nsame writer, in Acts 1: 12, where he relates that after the ascension the\ndisciples \u00e2\u0080\u009creturned unto Jerusalem by the mount called Olivet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke\nobviously did not mean to contradict himself; and the most that his\nexpression can be made to imply, is, that from Bethany, where their Lord\nhad ascended, which lies on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, a\nmile or more below the summit of the ridge, the disciples returned to\nJerusalem by a path across the mount.\n\nAs these disciples stood gazing and wondering, while a cloud received\ntheir Lord out of their sight, two angels stood by them in white apparel,\nannouncing unto them, that this same Jesus, who was thus taken up from\nthem into heaven, shall again so come, in like manner as they had seen him\ngo into heaven. With this annunciation closes the written history of our\nLord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resurrection and ascension.\n\n\n\n\n\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL OF JESUS.\n\n\nThe death of Jesus is universally regarded among Christians as a cruel\nmurder, perpetrated under the pretence of a legal sentence, after a trial,\nin which the forms of law were essentially and grossly violated. The Jews\nto this day maintain, that, whatever were the merits of the case, the\ntrial was at least regular, and the sentence legally just; that he was\naccused of blasphemy, and convicted of that offence by legal evidence. The\nquestion between them involves two distinct points of inquiry, namely,\nfirst, whether he was guilty of blasphemy; and, secondly, whether the\narraignment and trial were conducted in the ordinary forms of law. But\nthere will still remain a third question, namely, whether, admitting that,\nas a mere man, he had violated the law against blasphemy, he could legally\nbe put to death for that cause; and if not, then whether he was justly\ncondemned upon the new and supplemental accusation of treason or of\nsedition, which was vehemently urged against him. The first and last of\nthese inquiries it is proposed briefly to pursue; but it will be necessary\npreviously to understand the light in which he was regarded by the Jewish\nrulers and people, the state of their criminal jurisprudence and course of\nproceeding, and especially the nature and extent of the law concerning\nblasphemy, upon which he was indicted.\n\nIn the early period of the ministry of Jesus, he does not appear to have\nexcited among the Pharisees any emotion but wonder and astonishment, and\nan intense interest respecting the nature of his mission. But the people\nheard him with increasing avidity, and followed him in countless throngs.\nHe taught a purer religion than the Scribes and Pharisees, whose pride and\ncorruption he boldly denounced. He preached charity and humility, and\nperfect holiness of heart and life, as essential to the favour of God,\nwhose laws he expounded in all the depth of their spirituality, in\nopposition to the traditions of the elders, and the false glosses of the\nScribes and Pharisees. These sects he boldly charged with making void and\nrejecting the law of God, and enslaving men by their traditions; he\naccused them of hypocrisy, covetousness, oppression, and lust of power and\npopularity; and denounced them as hinderers of the salvation of others, as\na generation of serpents and vipers, doomed to final perdition. It was\nnatural that these terrific denunciations, from such a personage,\nsupported by his growing power and the increasing acclamations of the\npeople, should alarm the partisans of the ancient theocracy, and lead them\nto desire his destruction. This alarm evidently increased with the\nprogress of his ministry; and was greatly heightened by the raising of\nLazarus from the dead, on which occasion the death of Jesus was\ndefinitively resolved on;(324) but no active measures against him seem to\nhave been attempted, until the time when, under the parable of the wicked\nhusbandmen who cast the heir out of the vineyard and slew him, he declared\nthat the kingdom of God should be taken from them, and given to others\nmore worthy. Perceiving that he spake this parable against them, from that\nhour they sought to lay hands on him, and were restrained only by fear of\nthe popular indignation.(325)\n\nHaving thus determined to destroy Jesus at all events, as a person whose\nvery existence was fatal to their own power, and perhaps, in their view,\nto the safety of their nation, the first step was to render him odious to\nthe people; without which the design would undoubtedly recoil on the heads\nof its contrivers, his popularity being unbounded. Countless numbers had\nreceived the benefit of his miraculous gifts; and it was therefore deemed\na vain attempt to found an accusation, at that time, on any past\ntransaction of his life. A new occasion was accordingly sought, by\nendeavouring to \u00e2\u0080\u009centangle him in his talk;\u00e2\u0080\u009d a measure, planned and\nconducted with consummate cunning and skill. The Jews were divided into\ntwo political parties. One of these consisted of the Pharisees, who held\nit unlawful to acknowledge or pay tribute to the Roman emperor, because\nthey were forbidden, by the law of Moses,(326) to set a king over them who\nwas a stranger, and not one of their own countrymen. The other party was\ncomposed of the partisans of Herod, who understood this law to forbid only\nthe voluntary election of a stranger, and therefore esteemed it not\nunlawful to submit and pay tribute to a conqueror. These two parties,\nthough bitterly opposed to each other, united in the attempt to entrap\nJesus, by the question,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it lawful to give tribute to C\u00c3\u00a6sar, or\nnot?\u00e2\u0080\u009d(327) If he answered in the negative, the Herodians were to accuse\nhim to Pilate, for treason; if in the affirmative, the Pharisees would\ndenounce him to the people, as an enemy to their liberties.(328) This\ninsidious design was signally frustrated by the wisdom of his reply, when,\nreferring to C\u00c3\u00a6sar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s image and legend, on the coins which they all\nreceived as legally current, he showed the inconsistency of withholding\nthe honour due to one thus implicitly acknowledged by both parties to be\ntheir lawful sovereign.\n\nDefeated in this attempt to commit him politically, their next endeavour\nwas to render him obnoxious to one or the other of the two great religious\nsects, which were divided upon the doctrine of the resurrection, the\nPharisees affirming, and the Sadducees denying, that the dead would rise\nagain. The latter he easily silenced, by a striking exposition of their\nown law. They asked him which, of several husbands, would be entitled in\nthe next world to the wife whom they successively had married in this; and\nin reply, he showed them that in heaven the relation of husband and wife\nwas unknown.(329)\n\nTheir last trial was made by a lawyer, who sought to entrap him into an\nassertion that one commandment in the law was greater than another; a\ndesign rendered abortive by his reply that they were all of equal\nobligation.(330)\n\nIt being apparent, from these successive defeats, that any farther attempt\nto find new matter of accusation would result only in disgrace to\nthemselves, the enemies of Jesus seem to have come to the determination to\nsecure his person secretly, and afterwards to put him to death, in any\nmanner that would not render them odious to the people. In execution of\nthis design, they first bribed Judas to betray him by night into their\nhands. This object being attained, the next step was to destroy his\nreputation, and if possible to render him so vile in the public\nestimation, as that his destruction would be regarded with complacency.\nNow no charge could so surely produce this effect, and none could so\nplausibly be preferred against him, as that of blasphemy; a crime which\nthe Jews regarded with peculiar horror. Even their veneration of Jesus,\nand the awe which his presence inspired, had not been sufficient to\nrestrain their rising indignation on several occasions, when they regarded\nhis language as the blasphemous arrogation of a divine character and power\nto himself; and could they now be brought to believe him a blasphemer, and\nsee him legally convicted of this atrocious crime, his destruction might\neasily be brought about, without any very scrupulous regard to the form,\nand even with honour to those by whom it might be accomplished.\n\nIt will now be necessary to consider more particularly the nature of the\ncrime of blasphemy, in its larger signification, as it may be deduced from\nthe law of God. That the spirit of this law requires from all men,\neverywhere, and at all times, the profoundest veneration of the Supreme\nBeing, and the most submissive acknowledgment of Him as their rightful\nSovereign, is too plain to require argument. If proof were wanted, it is\nabundantly furnished in the Decalogue,(331) which is admitted among\nChristians to be of universal obligation. At the time when the Jewish\nTheocracy was established, idolatry had become generally prevalent, and\nmen had nearly lost all just notions of the nature and attributes of their\nCreator. It is therefore supposed that the design of Jehovah, in forming\nthe Jewish constitution and code of laws, was to preserve the knowledge of\nhimself as the true God, and to retain that people in the strictest\npossible allegiance to him alone; totally excluding every acknowledgment\nof any other being, either as an object of worship or a source of power.\nHence the severity with which he required that sorceries, divinations,\nwitchcrafts and false prophecies, as well as open idolatries, should be\npunished, they being alike acts of treason, or, as we might say, of\n_pr\u00c3\u00a6munire_, amounting to the open acknowledgment of a power independent\nof Jehovah. Hence, too, the great veneration in which he commanded that\nhis name and attributes should be held, even in ordinary conversation. It\nis the breach of this last law, to which the term _blasphemy_, in its more\nrestricted sense, has usually been applied;(332) but originally the\ncommand evidently extended to every word or act, directly in derogation of\nthe sovereignty of Jehovah, such as speaking in the name of another\ngod,(333) or omitting, on any occasion that required it, to give to\nJehovah the honour due to his own name.(334) Thus, when Moses and Aaron,\nat the command of God, smote the rock in Kadesh, that from it waters might\nflow to refresh the famishing multitude, but neglected to honour him as\nthe source of the miraculous energy, and arrogated it to themselves,\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHear now, ye rebels, must _we_ bring you water out of this\nrock?\u00e2\u0080\u009d(335) this omission drew on them his severe displeasure. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the\nLord spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify\n_me_ in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore _ye_ shall not bring\nthis congregation into the land which I have given them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Accordingly,\nboth Moses and Aaron died before the Israelites entered into the promised\nland.(336) No other deity was permitted to be invoked; no miracle must be\nwrought, but in the name of God alone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Jehovah; that is my name; and\nmy glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven\nimages.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(337) This was ever a cardinal principle of his law, neither newly\nannounced by Isaiah, nor by Moses. Its promulgation on Mount Sinai was\nmerely declaratory of what had been well understood at the beginning,\nnamely, that God alone was the Lord of all power and might, and would be\nexpressly acknowledged as such, in every exertion of superhuman energy or\nwisdom. Thus Joseph, when required to interpret the dream of Pharaoh,\nreplied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of\npeace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(338) And Moses, in all the miracles previously wrought by him in\nEgypt, expressly denounced them as the judgments of God, by whose hand\nalone they were inflicted.(339) After the solemn re-enactment of this law\non Mount Sinai, its signal violation by Moses and Aaron deserved to be\nmade as signal an example of warning; and this judgment of Jehovah may be\nsaid to constitute the leading case under this article of the law; forming\na rule of action and of judgment for all cases of miracles which might be\nwrought in all coming time. The same principle was afterwards expressly\nextended to prophesying. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe prophet\u00e2\u0080\u0094that shall speak in the name of\nother gods, even that prophet shall die.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(340) His character of prophet,\nand even his inspiration, shall not authorize him to prophesy but in the\nname of the Lord. He shall not exercise his office in his own name, nor in\nany name but that of Jehovah, from whom his power was derived.\n\nThat such was understood to be the true meaning of this law of God, is\nfurther evident from the practice of the prophets, in later times, to whom\nwas given the power of working miracles. These they always wrought in his\nname, expressly acknowledged at the time. Thus, the miracle of thunder and\nrain in the season of the wheat-harvest, called for by Samuel, he\nexpressly attributed to the Lord.(341) So did Elijah, when he called fire\nfrom heaven to consume his sacrifice, in refutation of the claims of\nBaal.(342) So did Elisha, when he divided the waters of Jordan, by smiting\nthem with the mantle of Elijah;(343) and again, when he miraculously\nmultiplied the loaves of bread, for the people that were with him;(344)\nand again, when he caused the young man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes to be opened, that he might\nbehold the hosts of the Lord around him, and smote his enemies with\nblindness.(345) And even the angel Gabriel, when sent to interpret to\nDaniel the things which should befall his people in the latter days,\nexplicitly announced himself as speaking in Jehovah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name.(346)\n\nThe same view of the sinfulness of exercising superhuman power without an\nexpress acknowledgment of God as its author, and of any usurpation of his\nauthority, continued to prevail, down to the time of our Saviour. Thus,\nwhen he said to the sick of the palsy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSon, be of good cheer, thy sins be\nforgiven thee,\u00e2\u0080\u009d certain of the Scribes said within themselves, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis man\nblasphemeth. Who can forgive sins, but God alone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d(347) And again, when\nthe Jews, on another occasion, took up stones to stone him, and Jesus,\nappealing to his good works done among them, asked for which of them he\nwas to be stoned; they replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor a good work we stone thee not, but\nfor blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself\nGod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(348) Yet Jesus had on no occasion mentioned the _name_ of Jehovah,\nbut with profound reverence.\n\nThus it appears that the law of blasphemy, as it was understood among the\nJews, extended not only to the offence of impiously using the name of the\nSupreme Being, but to every usurpation of his authority, or arrogation, by\na created being, of the honour and power belonging to him alone.(349) Like\nthe crime of treason among men, its essence consisted in acknowledging or\nsetting up the authority of another sovereign than one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own, or invading\nthe powers pertaining exclusively to him; an offence, of which the case of\nMoses, before cited, is a prominent instance, both in its circumstances\nand in its punishment. Whether a false god was acknowledged or the true\none denied, and whether the denial was in express terms, or by\nimplication, in assuming to do, by underived power, and in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own name,\nthat which God only could perform, the offence was essentially the same.\nAnd in such horror was it held by the Israelites, that in token of it\nevery one was obliged, by an early and universal custom, to rend his\ngarments, whenever it was committed or related in his presence.(350) This\nsentiment was deeply felt by the whole people, as a part of their\nreligion.\n\nSuch being the general scope and spirit of the law, it would seem to have\nbeen easy to prove that Jesus had repeatedly incurred its penalties. He\nhad performed many miracles, but never in any other name than his own. In\nhis own name, and without the recognition of any higher power, he had\nmiraculously healed the sick, restored sight to the blind and strength to\nthe lame, cast out devils, rebuked the winds, calmed the sea, and raised\nthe dead. In his own name, also, and with no allusion to the Omniscient,\nno \u00e2\u0080\u009cThus saith the Lord,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he had prophesied of things to come. He had by\nhis own authority forgiven sins, and promised, by his own power, not only\nto raise the dead, but to resume his own life, after he should, as he\npredicted, be put to death. Finally, he had expressly claimed for himself\na divine origin and character, and the power to judge both the quick and\nthe dead(351). Considered as a man, he had usurped the attributes of God.\nThat he was not arrested at an earlier period, is to be attributed to his\ngreat popularity, and the astounding effect of his miracles. His whole\ncareer had been resplendent with beneficence to the thousands who\nsurrounded him. His eloquence surpassed all that had been uttered by man.\nThe people were amazed, bewildered, and fascinated, by the resistless\npower of his life. It was not until his last triumphal visit to Jerusalem,\nafter he had openly raised Lazarus from the dead, when the chief priests\nand elders perceived that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe world was gone after him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that they were\nstricken with dismay and apprehension for their safety, and under this\npanic resolved upon the perilous measure of his destruction.\n\nThe only safe method in which this could be accomplished, was under the\nsanction of a legal trial and sentence. Jesus, therefore, upon his\napprehension, was first brought before the great tribunal of the\nSanhedrim, and charged with the crime of blasphemy. What were the\nspecifications under this general charge, or whether any were necessary,\nwe are not informed. But that this was the offence charged, is manifest\nboth from the evidence adduced and from the judgment of conviction.(352)\nSuch was the estimation in which he was held, that it was with great\ndifficulty that witnesses could be found to testify against him; and the\ntwo who at last were procured, testified falsely, in applying his words to\nthe temple of Solomon, which he spake of the temple of his body. When,\nupon the occasion of his scourging the money-changers out of the temple,\nthe Jews demanded by what authority he did this, Jesus replied, alluding\nto his own person, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDestroy _this_ temple, and in three days I will raise\nit up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(353) But though the witnesses swore falsely in testifying that he\nspake of the Jewish temple, yet his words, in either sense, amounted to a\nclaim of the power of working miracles, and so brought him within the law.\nThe high priest, however, still desirous of new evidence, which might\njustify his condemnation in the eyes of the people, proceeded to\ninterrogate Jesus concerning his character and mission. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI adjure thee, by\nthe living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of\nGod. Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless, I say unto you,\nhereafter ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power,\nand coming in the clouds of heaven. Then the high priest _rent his\nclothes_, saying He hath _spoken blasphemy_; what _further_ need have we\nof witnesses? Behold, now _ye have heard his blasphemy_. What think ye?\nThey answered and said, _He is guilty of death_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(354) We may suppose the\nmultitude standing without the hall of judgment, able, through its avenues\nand windows, to see, but not to hear, all that was transacting within. It\nbecame important, therefore, to obtain some reason upon which the high\npriest might rend his clothes in their sight, thus giving to the people,\nby this expressive and awful sign, the highest evidence of blasphemy,\nuttered by Jesus in the presence of that august assembly. This act turned\nthe tide of popular indignation against him, whose name, but a short time\nbefore, had been the theme of their loudest hosannas. There was now no\nneed to go into the past transactions of his ministry, for matter of\naccusation. His friends might claim for him on that score all that the\nwarmest gratitude and love could inspire; and all this could be safely\nconceded. But here, his accusers might say, was a new and shocking crime,\njust perpetrated in the presence of the most sacred tribunal; a crime so\nshocking, and so boldly committed, that the high priest rent his clothes\nwith horror, in the very judgment seat, in the presence of all the members\nof the Sanhedrim, who, with one accord, upon that evidence alone,\nimmediately convicted the offender and sentenced him to death.\n\nIf we regard Jesus simply as a Jewish citizen, and with no higher\ncharacter, this conviction seems substantially right in point of law,\nthough the trial were not legal in all its forms. For, whether the\naccusation were founded on the first or second commands in the decalogue,\nor on the law, laid down in the thirteenth chapter of Deuteronomy, or on\nthat in the eighteenth chapter and twentieth verse, he had violated them\nall, by assuming to himself powers belonging alone to Jehovah. And even if\nhe were recognized as a prophet of the Lord, he was still obnoxious to\npunishment, under the decision in the case of Moses and Aaron, before\ncited. It is not easy to perceive on what ground his conduct could have\nbeen defended before any tribunal, unless upon that of his superhuman\ncharacter. No lawyer, it is conceived, would think of placing his defence\nupon any other basis.\n\nThe great object of exciting the people against Jesus being thus\nsuccessfully accomplished, the next step was to obtain legal authority to\nput him to death. For though the Sanhedrim had condemned him, they had not\nthe power to pass a capital sentence; this being a right which had passed\nfrom the Jews by the conquest of their country, and now belonged to the\nRomans alone. They were merely citizens of a Roman province; they were\nleft in the enjoyment of their civil laws, the public exercise of their\nreligion, and many other things relating to their police and municipal\nregulations; but they had not the power of life and death. This was a\nprincipal attribute of sovereignty, which the Romans always took care to\nreserve to themselves in order to be able to reach those individuals who\nmight become impatient of the yoke, whatever else might be neglected.\n_Apud quos (Romanos), vis imperii valet; inania transmittuntur_.(355) The\njurisdiction of capital cases belonged ordinarily to the governor general\nor _Pr\u00c3\u00a6ses_ of a province, the _Procurator_ having for his principal duty\nonly the charge of the revenue and the cognizance of revenue causes. But\nthe right of taking cognizance of capital crimes was, in some cases, given\nto certain _Procurators_, who were sent into small provinces, to fill the\nplaces of governors, (_Vice Pr\u00c3\u00a6sides_,) as clearly appears from the Roman\nlaws. The government of all Syria was at this time under a governor\ngeneral, or _Pr\u00c3\u00a6ses_; of which Judea was one of the lesser dependencies,\nunder the charge of Pilate as _Vice Pr\u00c3\u00a6ses_, with capital\njurisdiction.(356)\n\nIt could not be expected that Pilate would trouble himself with the\ncognizance of any matter, not pertaining to the Roman law; much less with\nan alleged offence against the God of the Jews, who was neither\nacknowledged nor even respected by their conquerors. Of this the chief\npriests and elders were fully aware; and therefore they prepared a second\naccusation against Jesus, founded on the Roman law; as likely to succeed\nwith Pilate, as the former had done with the people. They charged him with\nattempting to restore the kingdom of Israel, under his own dominion as\nking of the Jews. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe found this fellow, said they, perverting the nation,\nand forbidding to give tribute to C\u00c3\u00a6sar, saying, That he himself is\nChrist, a king.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(357)\n\nIt was a charge of high treason against the Roman state and emperor; a\ncharge which was clearly within Pilate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cognizance, and which, as they\nwell knew, no officer of Tiberius would venture lightly to regard. Pilate\naccordingly forthwith arraigned Jesus, and called upon him to answer this\naccusation. It is worthy of note, that from the moment when he was accused\nof treason before Pilate, no further allusion was made to the previous\ncharge of blasphemy; the Roman governor being engaged solely with the\ncharge newly preferred before himself. The answer of Jesus to this charge\nsatisfied Pilate that it was groundless, the kingdom which he set up\nappearing plainly to be not a kingdom of this world, but his spiritual\nreign in righteousness and holiness and peace, in the hearts of men.\nPilate therefore acquitted him of the offence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe went out again unto the\nJews, and saith unto them, _I find in him no fault at all_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(358) Here was\na sentence of acquittal, judicially pronounced, and irreversible, except\nby a higher power, upon appeal; and it was the duty of Pilate thereupon to\nhave discharged him. But the multitude, headed now by the priests and\nelders, grew clamorous for his execution; adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stirreth up the\npeople, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this\nplace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(359) Hearing this reference to Galilee, Pilate seized the\nopportunity, thus offered, of escaping from the responsibility of a\njudgment, either of acquittal or of condemnation, by treating the case as\nout of his jurisdiction, and within that of Herod, tetrarch of Galilee,\nwho was then in Jerusalem on a visit. He therefore sent Jesus and his\naccusers to Herod; before whom the charge was vehemently renewed and\nurged. But Herod, too, perceived that it was utterly groundless, and\naccordingly treated it with derision, arraying Jesus in mock habiliments\nof royalty, and remanding him to Pilate.(360) The cause was then solemnly\nre-examined by the Roman governor, and a second judgment of acquittal\npronounced. For \u00e2\u0080\u009cPilate, when he had called together the chief priests and\nthe rulers, and the people, said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto\nme, as one that perverteth the people; and behold, I having examined him\nbefore you, have found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof\nye accuse him: No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and lo, nothing\nworthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chastise him and\nrelease him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(361)\n\nIt may seem strange to us that after a judgment of acquittal thus solemnly\npronounced, any judge, in a civilized country, should venture to reverse\nit, upon the same evidence, and without the pretence of mistake or error\nin the proceedings. Probably, in the settled jurisprudence of the city of\nRome, it could not have been done. But this was in a remote province of\nthe empire, under the administration not of a jurist, but a soldier; and\nhe, too, irresolute and vacillating; fearful for his office, and even for\nhis life, for he served the \u00e2\u0080\u009cdark and unrelenting Tiberius.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As soon as he\nproposed to release Jesus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this\nman go, thou art not C\u00c3\u00a6sar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend. Whosoever maketh himself a king,\nspeaketh against C\u00c3\u00a6sar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(362) Whereupon \u00e2\u0080\u009cPilate gave sentence that it\nshould be as they required.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(363) That Jesus was executed under the\npretence of treason, and that alone, is manifest from the tenor of the\nwriting placed over his head, stating that he was king of the Jews; such\nbeing the invariable custom among the Romans, in order that the public\nmight know for what crime the party had been condemned.(364) The remaining\nact in this tragedy is sufficiently known.\n\nIn the preceding remarks, the case has been considered only upon its\ngeneral merits, and with no reference to the manner in which the\nproceedings were conducted. But M. Dupin, in his tract on the Trial of\nJesus before the Sanhedrim, in reply to Mr. Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s account of it, has\nsatisfactorily shown that throughout the whole course of that trial the\nrules of the Jewish law of procedure were grossly violated, and that the\naccused was deprived of rights, belonging even to the meanest citizen. He\nwas arrested in the night, bound as a malefactor, beaten before his\narraignment, and struck in open court during the trial; he was tried on a\nfeast day, and before sunrise; he was compelled to criminate himself, and\nthis, under an oath or solemn judicial adjuration; and he was sentenced on\nthe same day of the conviction. In all these particulars the law was\nwholly disregarded.(365)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE JEWISH ACCOUNT OF THE TRIAL OF JESUS. BY MR. SALVADOR.\n\n\nMR. JOSEPH SALVADOR, a physician and a learned Jew, a few years ago\npublished at Paris, a work, entitled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistoire des Institutions de Mo\u00c3\u00afse\net du Peuple H\u00c3\u00a9breu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in which, among other things, he gives an account of\ntheir course of criminal procedure, in a chapter on \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Administration of\nJustice;\u00e2\u0080\u009d which he illustrates, in a succeeding chapter, by an account of\nthe trial of Jesus. As this is the recent work of a man of learning,\nhimself a Jew, it may be regarded as an authentic statement of what is\nunderstood and held by the most intelligent and best informed Jews,\nrespecting the claims of our Lord, the tenor of his doctrines, the nature\nof the charge laid against him before the Sanhedrim, and the grounds on\nwhich they condemned him. The following translation of the last-mentioned\nchapter will therefore not be unacceptable to the reader. It will be found\nin Book IV. chapter iii., entitled, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trial and Condemnation of Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe reader will bear in his mind, that it is the language of an enemy of\nour Saviour, and in justification of his murderers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAccording to this exposition of judicial proceedings,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the Jew, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nshall follow out the application of them in the most memorable tried in\nhistory, that of Jesus Christ. I have already explained the motives which\nhave directed me, and the point of view in which I have considered the\nsubject; I have already shown, that among the Jews no title was a shelter\nagainst a prosecution and sentence. Whether the law or its forms were good\nor bad, is not the object of my present investigation; neither is it to\nascertain whether we ought to pity the blindness of the Hebrews in not\ndiscovering a Deity in Jesus, or to be astonished that a God personified\ncould not make himself comprehended when he desired it. But since they\nregarded him only as a citizen, did they not try him according to their\nlaw and its existing forms? This is my question, which can admit of no\nequivocation. I shall draw all my facts from the Evangelists themselves,\nwithout inquiring whether all this history was developed after the event,\nto serve as a form to a new doctrine, or to an old one which had received\na fresh impulse.\n\nJesus was born of a family of small fortune; Joseph, his supposed father,\nperceived that his wife was big before they had come together. If he had\nbrought her to trial, in the ordinary course of things, Mary, according to\nthe 23rd verse of the 22nd chapter of Deuteronomy, would have been\ncondemned, and Jesus, having been declared illegitimate, could never,\naccording to the 2nd verse of the 23rd chapter, have been admitted to a\nseat in the Sanhedrim.(366) But Joseph, who, to save his wife from\ndisgrace, had taken the resolution of sending her away privately, soon had\na dream which consoled him.(367)\n\nAfter having been circumcised, Jesus grew like other men, attended the\nsolemn feasts, and early displayed surprising wisdom and sagacity. In the\nassembly on the Sabbath, the Jews, eager for the disputes to which the\ninterpretation of the law gave rise, loved to hear him. But he soon\ndevoted himself to more important labours; he pronounced censures against\nwhole towns, Capernaum, Chorazin and Bethsaida.(368) Recalling the times\nof Isaiah and Jeremiah, he thundered against the chiefs of the people with\na vehemence which would in our day be terrific.(369) The people then\nregarded him as a prophet;(370) they heard him preach in towns and country\nwithout opposition; they saw him surrounded with disciples according to\nthe custom of the learned men of the age; whatever may have been the\nresentment of the chief men, they were silent as long as he confined\nhimself to the law.\n\nBut Jesus, in presenting new theories, and in giving new forms to those\nalready promulgated, speaks of himself as God; his disciples repeat it;\nand the subsequent events prove in the most satisfactory manner, that they\nthus understood him.(371) This was shocking blasphemy in the eyes of the\ncitizens: the law commands them to follow Jehovah alone, the only true\nGod; not to believe in gods of flesh and bone, resembling men or women;\nneither to spare nor listen to a prophet who, even doing miracles, should\nproclaim a new god, a god whom neither they nor their fathers had\nknown.(372)\n\nJesus having said to them one day: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have come down from heaven to do\nthese things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the Jews, who till then had listened to him, murmured and\ncried: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs not this Jesus, the son of Joseph and of Mary? we know his\nfather, his mother, and his brethren; why then does he say that he has\ncome down from heaven?\u00e2\u0080\u009d(373) On another day, the Jews, irritated from the\nsame cause, took stones and threatened him. Jesus said unto them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\ndone good works in your eyes by the power of my Father, for which of these\nworks would you stone me? It is for no good work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the Jews, who\nstated the whole process in few words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut because of thy blasphemy; for\nbeing a man,(374) thou makest thyself God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(375)\n\nHis language was not always clear. Often his disciples themselves did not\ncomprehend him. Among his maxims, some of which showed the greatest\nmildness, there were some which the Hebrews, who were touched only through\ntheir natural sense, thought criminal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThink not that I am come to send\npeace on earth; I came not to send peace, but a sword. For I am come to\nset a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her\nmother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfoes shall be they of his own household. He that loveth father or mother\nmore than me, is not worthy of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(376) Finally, if he wrought miracles\nbefore certain of the people, his replies to the questions of the doctors\nwere generally evasive.(377)\n\nIn regard to political relations, he caused dissensions.(378) A great\nnumber of disorderly persons whom he had the design of reclaiming, but who\ninspired dread in the national council, attached themselves to him;(379)\nhis discourse flattered them inasmuch as he pronounced anathemas against\nriches. \u00e2\u0080\u009cKnow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat it is easier for a camel to go through the\neye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(380)\nIn this state of affairs, the council deliberates; some are of opinion\nthat he should be regarded as a madman,(381) others say that he seeks to\nseduce the people.(382) Caiaphas, the high priest, whose dignity compels\nhim to defend the letter of the law, observes that these dissensions would\nfurnish an excuse to the Romans for overwhelming Judea, and that the\ninterests of the whole nation must outweigh those of a single individual;\nhe constitutes himself the accuser of Jesus.(383)\n\nThe order is given to seize him. But let us pause here upon a fact of the\nhighest importance. The senate did not begin by actually seizing Jesus, as\nis now the practice; they begin by giving, after some debate, an order\nthat he should be seized.(384) This decree is made public; it is known to\nall, especially to Jesus. No opposition is offered to his passing the\nfrontier: his liberty depends entirely upon himself. This is not all; the\norder for his arrest was preceded by a decree of admonition. One day,\nJesus having entered the temple, took upon himself authority contrary to\nthe common law; then he preached to the people, and said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat those who\nshould believe in him should be able to do all things, so that if they\nshould say to a mountain, remove thyself and cast thyself into the sea, it\nwould obey.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then the chief priest and senators went to find him and said\nto him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy what authority doest thou these things? who gave thee this\npower?\u00e2\u0080\u009d(385)\n\nMeanwhile a traitor discloses the place whither the accused had retired;\nthe guards, authorized by the high priest and by the elders,(386) hasten\nto seize him. One of his disciples, breaking into open rebellion, with a\nstroke of his sword cuts off the ear of one of them, and brings upon\nhimself the reproof of his master.(387) As soon as Jesus is arrested, the\nzeal of the apostles is extinguished; all forsake him.(388) He is brought\nbefore the grand council, where the priests sustain the accusation. The\nwitnesses testify, and they are numerous; for the deeds of which he is\naccused were done in the presence of all the people. The two witnesses\nwhom St. Matthew and St. Mark accuse of perjury, relate a discourse which\nSt. John declares to be true, with regard to the power which Jesus\narrogates to himself.(389) Finally, the high priest addresses the accused,\nand says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it true that thou art Christ, that thou art the Son of God?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am he,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replies Jesus; \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou shall see me hereafter at the right hand of\nthe majesty of God, who shall come upon the clouds of heaven.\u00e2\u0080\u009d At these\nwords, Caiaphas rent his garments in token of horror.(390) \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have heard\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They deliberate.\n\nThe question already raised among the people was this: Has Jesus become\nGod? But the senate having adjudged that Jesus, son of Joseph, born at\nBethlehem, had profaned the name of God by usurping it to himself, a mere\ncitizen, applied to him the law of blasphemy, and the law in the 13th\nchapter of Deuteronomy, and the 20th verse in chapter 18, according to\nwhich every prophet, even he who works miracles, must be punished, when he\nspeaks of a god unknown to the Jews and their fathers:(391) the capital\nsentence was pronounced. As to the ill-treatment which followed the\nsentence, it was contrary to the spirit of the Jewish law; and it is not\nin the course of nature, that a senate composed of the most respectable\nmen of a nation, who, however they might have been deceived, yet intended\nto act legally, should have permitted such outrages against him whose life\nwas at their disposal. The writers who have transmitted to us these\ndetails, not having been present at the trial, have been disposed to\nexaggerate the picture, either on account of their prejudices, or to throw\ngreater obloquy on the judges.\n\nOne thing is certain, that the council met again on the morning of the\nnext day or the day following that,(392) as the law requires, to confirm\nor to annul the sentence: it was confirmed. Jesus was brought before\nPilate, the procurator that the Romans had placed over the Jews. They had\nretained the power of trying according to their own laws, but the\nexecutive power was in the hands of the procurator alone: no criminal\ncould be executed without his consent: this was in order that the Senate\nshould not have the means of reaching men who were sold to\nforeigners.(393) Pilate, the Roman, signed the decree. His soldiers, an\nimpure mixture of diverse nations, were charged with the punishment. These\nare they who brought Jesus to the judgment hall, who stripped him before\nthe whole cohort, who placed upon his head a crown of thorns, and a reed\nin his hand, who showed all the barbarity to which the populace in all\nages is disposed; who finally caused him to undergo a punishment common at\nRome, and which was not in use among the Jews.(394) But before the\nexecution, the governor had granted to the condemned an appeal to the\npeople, who, respecting the judgment of their own council, would not\npermit this favour, couching their refusal in these terms: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a law;\nand by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of\nGod.\u00e2\u0080\u009d(395) Then Pilate left them the choice of saving Jesus, or a man\naccused of murder in a sedition; the people declared for the latter;\nsaying that the other would scatter the seeds of discord in the bosom of\nthe nation, at a time when union was most necessary.(396)\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus was put to death. The priests and elders went to the place of\npunishment; and as the sentence was founded upon this fact, that he had\nunlawfully arrogated to himself the title of Son of God, God himself, they\nappealed to him thus: \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thou wouldst save others; thyself thou canst not\nsave. If thou art indeed the king of Israel, come down into the midst of\nus, and we will believe in thee, since thou hast said, I am the Son of\nGod, let that God who loves thee come now to thine aid.\u00e2\u0080\u0099(397) According to\nthe Evangelist, these words were a mockery; but the character of the\npersons who pronounced them, their dignity, their age, the order which\nthey had observed in the trial, prove their good faith. Would not a\nmiracle at this time have been decisive?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE TRIAL OF JESUS BEFORE CAIAPHAS AND PILATE.\n\n\n   Being A Refutation Of Mr. Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chapter Entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trial And\n Condemnation Of Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By M. Dupin. Translated From The French by John\n                             Pickering, LL.D.\n\n\n\n\nPreface.\n\n\nA few years ago, Mr. Joseph Salvador, a physician\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a descendant of one\nof those Jewish families, whom the intolerance of Ferdinand the Catholic\nexpelled, in a body, from Spain, about the year 1492\u00e2\u0080\u0094published at Paris a\nlearned work, entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cHistoire des Institutions de Mo\u00c3\u00afse et du Peuple\nH\u00c3\u00a9breu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or History of the Institutions of Moses and the Hebrew People;\nand in one chapter of his work he gives an account of the _Administration\nof Justice_ among the Hebrews. To that chapter he has subjoined an account\nof the \u00e2\u0080\u009cTrial and Condemnation of Jesus;\u00e2\u0080\u009d in the course of which he\nexpresses his opinion, that the trial, considered merely _as a legal\nproceeding_, was conformable to the Jewish laws.\n\nThe author of the following little work, M. Dupin, who is one of the most\neminent lawyers of the French Bar, immediately called in question the\ncorrectness of Mr. Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion, and entered upon an analysis of\nthis portion of his work, with a view to examine its soundness, and the\npresent volume contains the result of that examination, conducted with\ngreat legal skill and extensive learning.\n\nIt appears, that he had, many years before, in a little work, entitled\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_The Free_ Defence of Accused Persons,\u00e2\u0080\u009d published in 1815, taken the same\nviews of this great trial; which, as he observes, has been justly called\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe _Passion_ or _Suffering_ of our Saviour; for he did in truth\n_suffer_, and had not a trial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe author\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention, however, had been withdrawn from this subject for\nseveral years, when it was again brought under his notice by the work of\nMr. Salvador, a copy of which was sent to him by that writer, with a\nrequest that M. Dupin would give some account of it. Accordingly, says the\nlatter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is in compliance with _his request_, and not from a spirit of\nhostility, that I have made this examination of his work;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he gives\nample proof of his good feeling towards Mr. Salvador, with whom, he says,\nhe is personally acquainted and for whose talents he has a great respect.\n\nWith this friendly spirit he enters upon his examination; which is\nconducted with an ability, learning, animation, and interest, that leave\nnothing to be desired. As an argument, his work is unanswerable,\u00e2\u0080\u0094he has\ndemolished that of his adversary; and, for intense interest, we do not\nknow any publication of the present day to be compared with it.\n\nThe introductory _Analysis_ of Mr. Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chapter on the\nAdministration of Justice according to the Jewish Law will be highly\ninstructive and interesting; and those persons, who have not been\naccustomed to read the Bible with particular reference to the _Law_, will\nfind many new and striking views of that portion of the Scriptures. They\ncannot fail to be particularly struck with the extraordinary care taken to\nsecure by law the personal liberty and rights of the citizen.\n\nAccording to Mr. Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s view, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe fundamental division into _castes_\nis the principal basis of the oriental theocracies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moses, on the\ncontrary, took for his basis the _unity_ of the people. In his system of\nlegislation the people are every thing; and the author shows us, that\nevery thing, eventually, is done for them, by them, and with them. The\ntribe of Levi was established, only to supply a secondary want; and that\ntribe was very far from obtaining all the powers which we are apt to\nattribute to it; it did not make, nor develope the laws; it did not judge\nor govern; all its members, even the high priest himself, were subject to\nthe control of the Elders of the nation, or of a Senate legally assembled.\n\nIntimately connected with these rights of the people was the _liberty of\nspeech_; and Mr. Salvador, in his chapter on the _Public Orators and\nProphets_, maintains, and in the opinion of M. Dupin, proves clearly, that\nin no nation was the liberty of speech ever so unlimited, as among the\nHebrews. Accordingly he observes\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an additional difference was this\nbetween the Israelites and the Egyptians! Among the latter, the mass of\nthe people did not dare, without incurring the hazard of the most terrible\npunishment, to utter a word on affairs of state; it was Harpocrates, the\ngod of silence with his finger on his closed lips, who was their God; in\nIsrael, it was _the right of speech_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut we forbear any further reflections, and submit this remarkable\nperformance to our readers. Those, who are familiar with the animated tone\nof French writers, will perhaps discover in this translation some loss of\nthe fire and intensity of the original; but the translator\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose will\nbe effected, if his version shall be found to be a faithful one.\n\nSeptember 3, 1839.\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis Of The Chapter Of Mr. Salvador, Entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Administration Of\nJustice\u00e2\u0080\u009d Among The Jews.(398)\n\n\nMr. Salvador has discussed with particular care whatever relates to the\n_administration of justice_ among the Jewish people. We shall dwell upon\nthis chapter, which undoubtedly will most interest our readers.\n\n_Judicare_ and _judicari_, to judge and to be judged, express the rights\nof every Hebrew citizen; that is, no one could be condemned without a\njudgment, and every one might, in his turn, be called upon to sit in\njudgment upon others. Some exceptions to this principle are explained; but\nthey do not affect the rule. In matters of mere interest each party chose\na judge, and these two chose a third person. If a discussion arose as to\n_the interpretation of a law_, they carried it to the lower council of\nElders, and from thence to the Great council at Jerusalem. Each town of\nmore than one hundred and twenty families was to have its lower council,\nconsisting of twenty-three members; and these had jurisdiction in criminal\ncases.\n\nThe expressions, _he shall die, he shall be cut off from the people_,\nwhich are so often used in the Mosaic law, embrace three very different\nsignifications, which we are accustomed to confound. They indicate the\nsuffering of death as a punishment, civil death, and that premature death,\nwith which an individual is naturally threatened, who departs from those\nrules which are useful to the nation and to the individual himself. Civil\ndeath is the last degree of _separation_, or _excommunication_; it is\npronounced, as a judicial punishment, by the assembly of the judges.\n\nThere were three kinds of separation; which Mr. Salvador compares to the\nthree degrees of civil excommunication provided for in the French Penal\nCode, and which condemn the criminal to hard labour either for life or for\na term of years, or to certain correctional punishments. But the Hebrew\nexcommunication had this advantage, that the party _never lost all hope of\nregaining his original standing_.\n\nThe Hebrew lawyers, in relation to the punishment of death, maintained\nopinions, which deserve to be quoted:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA tribunal, which condemns to death _once in seven years_, may be called\n_sanguinary_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt deserves this appellation, says doctor Eliezer, when it\npronounces a like sentence once in seventy years.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we had been members\nof the high court, say the doctors Tyrphon and Akiba, we should never have\ncondemned a man to death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, replied\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould not\nthat be an abuse? Would you not have been afraid of multiplying crimes in\nIsrael?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mr. Salvador answers\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, certainly; far from lessening their\nnumber, the severity of the punishment increases it, by giving a more\nresolute character to the men who are able to brave it; and, at the\npresent day, how many intelligent minds range themselves on the side of\nAkiba and Tyrphon! How many consciences refuse to participate, in any\nmanner, in the death of a man! The flowing of blood, the multitude excited\nby an unbecoming curiosity, the victim dragged in triumph to the horrible\naltar, the impossibility of repairing a mistake, (from which human wisdom\nis never exempt), the dread of one day seeing a departed shade rising up\nand saying, \u00e2\u0080\u0098_I was innocent_,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the facility which modern nations have of\nexpelling from among them the man whose presence pollutes them\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\ninfluence of general depravity on the production of crimes\u00e2\u0080\u0094and finally the\nabsurd contrast of the whole of society, while in possession of strength,\nintelligence, and arms, opposing itself to an individual wretch (who has\nbeen drawn on by want, by passion, or by ignorance) and yet finding no\nother means of redress than by exceeding him in cruelty\u00e2\u0080\u0094all these things,\nand many others, have so deeply penetrated the minds of all ranks of\npeople, that there will one day proceed from them the most striking proof\nof the power of morals over the laws; for the law will be changed by the\nsimple fact, that we shall not find any person who will consent to apply\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI feel honoured in having maintained the same opinion in my _Observations\non Criminal Legislation_; but I solicit those, who wish to see this\nquestion discussed in its whole extent, to read the profound reflections\nwhich the Duke de Broglie has just published on the subject, in the last\nnumber of the _Revue Fran\u00c3\u00a7aise_ (for October, 1828.)\n\nThe whole criminal procedure in the Pentateuch rests upon three\nprinciples, which may be thus expressed; publicity of the trial, entire\nliberty of defence allowed to the accused; and a guaranty against the\ndangers of testimony. According to the Hebrew text _one_ witness is no\nwitness; there must be at least two or three who know the fact. The\nwitness, who testifies against a man, must swear that he speaks the truth;\nthe judges then proceed to take exact information of the matter; and, if\nit is found that the witness has sworn falsely, they compel him to undergo\nthe punishment to which he would have exposed his neighbour. The\ndiscussion between the accuser and the accused is conducted before the\nwhole assembly of the people. When a man is condemned to death, those\nwitnesses whose evidence decided the sentence inflict the first blows, in\norder to add the last degree of certainty to their evidence. Hence the\nexpression\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Let him among you, who is without sin, cast the first stone_.\n\nIf we pursue their application of these fundamental rules in practice, we\nshall find that a trial proceeded in the following manner.\n\nOn the day of the trial, the executive officers of justice caused the\naccused person to make his appearance. At the feet of the Elders were\nplaced men who, under the name of _auditors_, or _candidates_, followed\nregularly the sittings of the Council. The papers in the case were read;\nand the witnesses were called in succession. The president addressed this\nexhortation to each of them: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not conjectures, or whatever public\nrumour has brought to thee, that we ask of thee; consider that a great\nresponsibility rests upon thee: that we are not occupied by an affair,\nlike a case of pecuniary interest, in which the injury may be repaired. If\nthou causest the condemnation of a person unjustly accused, his blood, and\nthe blood of all the posterity of him, of whom thou wilt have deprived the\nearth, will fall upon thee; God will demand of thee an account, as he\ndemanded of Cain an account of the blood of Abel. Speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA woman could not be a witness, because she would not have the courage to\ngive the first blow to the condemned person; nor could a child, that is\nirresponsible, nor a slave, nor a man of bad character, nor one whose\ninfirmities prevent the full enjoyment of his physical and moral\nfaculties. _The simple confession of an individual against himself_, or\nthe declaration of a prophet, however renowned, would not decide a\ncondemnation. The Doctors say\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe hold it as fundamental, that _no one\nshall prejudice himself_. If a man accuses himself before a tribunal, we\nmust not believe him, unless the fact is attested by two other witnesses;\nand it is proper to remark, that the punishment of death inflicted upon\nAchan, in the time of Joshua(399) was an exception, occasioned by the\nnature of the circumstances; for our law does not condemn upon the simple\nconfession of the accused, nor upon the declaration of one prophet alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe witnesses were to attest to the identity of the party, and to depose\nto the month, day, hour, and circumstances of the crime. After an\nexamination of the proofs, those judges who believed the party innocent\nstated their reasons; those who believed him guilty spoke afterwards, and\n_with the greatest moderation_. If one of the _auditors_, or _candidates_,\nwas entrusted by the accused with his defence, or if he wished in his own\nname to present any elucidations in favour of innocence, he was admitted\nto the seat, from which he addressed the judges and the people. But this\nliberty was not granted to him, if his opinion was in favour of\ncondemning. Lastly; when the accused person himself wished to speak, they\ngave the most profound attention. When the discussion was finished, one of\nthe judges recapitulated the case; they removed all the spectators; two\nscribes took down the votes of the judges; one of them noted those which\nwere in favour of the accused, and the other, those which condemned him.\nEleven votes, out of twenty-three, were sufficient to acquit; but it\nrequired thirteen to convict. If any of the judges stated that they were\nnot sufficiently informed, there were added two more Elders, and then two\nothers in succession, till they formed a council of sixty-two, which was\nthe number of the Grand Council. If a majority of votes acquitted, the\naccused was discharged _instantly_; if he was to be punished, the judges\npostponed pronouncing sentence till the third day; during the intermediate\nday they could not be occupied with anything but the cause, and they\nabstained from eating freely, and from wine, liquors, and everything which\nmight render their minds less capable of reflection.\n\nOn the morning of the third day they returned to the judgment seat. Each\njudge, who had not changed his opinion, said, _I continue of the same\nopinion and condemn_; any one, who at first condemned, might at this\nsitting acquit; but he who had once acquitted was not allowed to condemn.\nIf a majority condemned, two _magistrates_ immediately accompanied the\ncondemned person to the place of punishment. The Elders did not descend\nfrom their seats; they placed at the entrance of the judgment hall an\nofficer of justice with a small flag in his hand; a second officer, on\nhorseback, followed the prisoner, and constantly kept looking back to the\nplace of departure. During this interval, if any person came to announce\nto the Elders any new evidence favourable to the prisoner, the first\nofficer waved his flag, and the second one, as soon as he perceived it,\nbrought back the prisoner. If the prisoner declared to the _magistrates_,\nthat he recollected some reasons which had escaped him, they brought him\nbefore the _judges_ no less than five times. If no incident occurred, the\nprocession advanced slowly, preceded by a herald who, in a loud voice,\naddressed the people thus: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis man (stating his name and surname) is led\nto punishment for such a crime; the witnesses who have sworn against him\nare such and such persons; if any one has evidence to give in his favour,\nlet him come forth quickly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was in consequence of this rule that the youthful Daniel caused the\nprocession to go back, which was leading Susanna to punishment, and he\nhimself ascended the seat of justice to put some new questions to the\nwitnesses.\n\nAt some distance from the place of punishment, they urged the prisoner to\nconfess his crime, and they made him drink a stupefying beverage, in order\nto render the approach of death less terrible.(400)\n\nBy this mere analysis of a part of Mr. Salvador\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work we may judge of the\nextreme interest of the whole. His principal object has been, to make\napparent the mutual aids which history, philosophy, and legislation afford\nin explaining the institutions of the Jewish people. His book is a\nscientific work, and at the same time a work of taste. His notes indicate\nvast reading; and in the choice of his citations he gives proofs of his\ncritical skill and discrimination. Mr. Salvador belongs, by his age, to\nthat new generation, which is distinguished as much by its application to\nsolid studies, as by elevation and generosity of sentiment.\n\n\n\n\nTrial Of Jesus.\n\n\n    Refutation Of The Chapter Of Mr. Salvador, Entitled \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Trial And\n                         Condemnation Of Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe chapter, in which Mr. Salvador treats of _the Administration of\nJustice among the Hebrews_, is altogether theoretical. He makes an\nexposition of the law\u00e2\u0080\u0094that things, in order to be _conformable to rule_,\nmust be transacted in a certain mode. In all this I have not contradicted\nhim, but have let him speak for himself.\n\nIn the subsequent chapter the author announces: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat according to this\n_exposition of judicial proceedings_ he is going to follow out the\napplication of them to the most memorable trial in all history, that of\nJesus Christ.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Accordingly the chapter is entitled: _The Trial and\nCondemnation of Jesus_.\n\nThe author first takes care to inform us under what point of view he\nintends to give an account of that accusation: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat we ought to lament\nthe blindness of the Hebrews for not having recognised a God in Jesus, is\na point which I do not examine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (There is another thing also, which he\nsays he shall not examine.) \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, when they discovered in him _only a\ncitizen_, did they try him _according to existing laws and formalities_?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe question being thus stated, Mr. Salvador goes over all the various\naspects of the accusation; and his conclusion is, that the procedure was\nperfectly regular, and the condemnation perfectly appropriate to the act\ncommitted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, (p. 87,) \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Senate, having adjudged that\nJesus, the son of Joseph, born in Bethlehem, had profaned the name of God\nby usurping it himself, though a simple citizen, applied to him the law\nagainst blasphemy, the law in the 13th chapter of Deuteronomy, and verse\n20, chapter 18th, conformably to which every prophet, even one that\nperforms miracles, is to be punished when he speaks of a God unknown to\nthe Hebrews or their fathers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis conclusion is formed to please the followers of the Jewish law; it is\nwholly for their benefit, and the evident object is, to justify them from\nthe reproach of _de\u00c3\u00afcide_.\n\nWe will, however, avoid treating this grave subject in a theological point\nof view. As to myself, Jesus Christ is the _Man-God_; but it is not with\narguments drawn from my religion and my creed, that I intend to combat the\nstatement and the conclusion of Mr. Salvador. The present age would charge\nme with being intolerant; and this is a reproach which I will never incur.\nBesides, I do not wish to give to the enemies of Christianity the\nadvantage of making the outcry, that we are afraid to enter into a\ndiscussion with them, and that we wish to crush rather than to convince\nthem. Having thus contented myself with declaring my own faith, as Mr.\nSalvador has let us clearly understand his, I shall also examine the\nquestion under a merely _human_ point of view, and proceed to inquire,\nwith him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether Jesus Christ, considered _as a simple citizen_, was\ntried according to the existing laws and formalities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe catholic religion itself warrants me in this; it is not a mere\nfiction; for God willed, that Jesus should be clothed in the forms of\nhumanity (_et homo factus est_), and that he should undergo the lot and\nsufferings of humanity. The _son of God_, as to his moral state and his\nholy spirit, he was also, in reality, the _Son of Man_, for the purpose of\naccomplishing the mission which he came upon earth to fulfil.\n\nThis being the state of the question, then, I enter upon my subject; and I\ndo not hesitate to affirm, because I will prove it, that, upon examining\nall the circumstances of this great trial, we shall be very far from\ndiscovering in it the application of those legal maxims, which are the\nsafeguard of the rights of accused persons, and of which Mr. Salvador, in\nhis chapter _On the Administration of Justice_, has made a seductive\nexposition.\n\nThe accusation of Jesus, instigated by the hatred of the priests and the\nPharisees, and presented at first as a charge of _sacrilege_, but\nafterwards converted into a _political_ crime and _an offence against the\nstate_, was marked, in all its aspects, with the foulest acts of violence\nand perfidy. It was not so much _a trial_ environed with legal forms, as a\nreal _passion_, or prolonged suffering, in which the imperturbable\ngentleness of the victim displays more strongly the unrelenting ferocity\nof his persecutors.\n\nWhen Jesus appeared among the Jews, that people was but the shadow of\nitself. Broken down by more than one subjugation, divided by factions and\nirreconcilable sects, they had in the last resort been obliged to succumb\nto the Roman power and surrender their own sovereignty. Jerusalem, having\nbecome a mere appendage to the province of Syria, saw within its walls an\nimperial garrison; Pilate commanded there, in the name of C\u00c3\u00a6sar; and the\nlate people of God were groaning under the double tyranny of a conqueror,\nwhose power they abhorred and whose idolatry they detested, and of a\npriesthood that exerted itself to keep them under the rigorous bonds of a\nreligious fanaticism.\n\nJesus Christ deplored the misfortunes of his country. How often did he\nweep for Jerusalem! Read in Bossuet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Politics drawn from the Holy\nScriptures_, the admirable chapter entitled, _Jesus Christ the good\ncitizen_. He recommended to his countrymen _union_, which constitutes the\nstrength of states. \u00e2\u0080\u009cO Jerusalem, Jerusalem, (said he,) thou that killest\nthe prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I\nhave gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens\nunder her wings, and ye would not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was supposed to be not favorable to the Romans; but he only loved his\nown countrymen more. Witness the address of the Jews, who, in order to\ninduce him to restore to the centurion a sick servant that was dear to\nhim, used as the most powerful argument these words\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he was worthy for\nwhom he should do this, for he loveth our nation. And Jesus went with\nthem. Luke vii. 4, 5.\n\nTouched with the distresses of the nation, Jesus comforted them by holding\nup to them the hope of another life; he alarmed the great, the rich, and\nthe haughty, by the prospect of a final judgment, at which every man would\nbe judged not according to his rank, but his works. He was desirous of\nagain bringing back man to his original dignity; he spoke to him of his\n_duties_, but at the same time of his _rights_. The people heard him with\navidity, and followed him with eagerness; his words affected them; his\nhand healed their diseases, and his moral teaching instructed them; he\npreached, and practised one virtue till then unknown, and which belongs to\nhim alone\u00e2\u0080\u0094_charity_. This celebrity, however, and these wonders excited\nenvy. The partisans of the _ancient theocracy_ were alarmed at the _new\ndoctrine_; the chief priests felt that their power was threatened; the\npride of the Pharisees was humbled; the scribes came in as their\nauxiliaries, and the destruction of Jesus was resolved upon.\n\nNow, if his conduct was reprehensible, if it afforded grounds for a _legal\naccusation_, why was not that course taken openly? Why not try him for the\nacts committed by him, and for his public discourses? Why employ against\nhim subterfuges, artifice, perfidy, and violence? for such was the mode of\nproceeding against Jesus.\n\nLet us now take up the subject, and look at the narratives which have come\ndown to us. Let us, with Mr. Salvador, open the books of the Gospels; for\nhe does not object to that testimony; nay, he relies upon it: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is by\nthe Gospels themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I shall establish _all the\nfacts_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn truth, how can we (except by contrary evidence, of which there is none)\nrefuse to place confidence in an historian, who tells us, as Saint John\ndoes, with affecting simplicity: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe that saw it bare record, and his\nrecord is true, and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJohn xix. 35.\n\nSection I.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SPIES, OR INFORMERS.\n\nWho will not be surprised to find in this case the odious practice of\nemploying hired informers? Branded with infamy, as they are in modern\ntimes, they will be still more so when we carry back their origin to the\ntrial of Christ. It will be seen presently, whether I have not properly\ncharacterized by the name of hired informers those emissaries, whom the\nchief priests sent out to be about Jesus.\n\nWe read in the evangelist Luke, chap. xx. 20: _Et observantes miserunt\ninsidiatores, qui se justos simularent, ut caperent eum in sermone, et\ntraderent illum principatui et potestati pr\u00c3\u00a6sidis_. I will not translate\nthis text myself, but will take the language of a translator whose\naccuracy is well known, Mr. De Sacy: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs they only sought occasions for\nhis destruction, they sent to him _apostate persons who feigned themselves\njust men_, in order to _take hold_ of his words, that they might deliver\nhim unto magistrate and into the power of the governor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Mr. De Sacy\nadds\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cif there should escape from him the least word against the public\nauthorities.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis first artifice has escaped the sagacity of Mr. Salvador.\n\nSection II.\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE CORRUPTION AND TREACHERY OF JUDAS.\n\nAccording to Mr. Salvador, the senate, as he calls it, did not commence\ntheir proceedings by arresting Jesus, as would be done at the present day;\nbut they began by passing a preliminary decree, that he should be\narrested; and he cites, in proof of his assertion, St. John xi. 53, 54,\nand St. Matthew xxvi. 4, 5.\n\nBut St. John says nothing of this pretended decree. He speaks, too, not of\na public sitting, but of a consultation held by the chief priests and the\n_Pharisees_, who did not, to my knowledge, constitute a judicial tribunal\namong the Jews. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a\ncouncil, and said, What do we? for this man _doeth many miracles_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John\nxi. 47. They add: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we let him thus alone, all men will believe on\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094which imported also, in their minds, _and they will no longer\nbelieve in us_. Now, in this, I can readily perceive the fear of seeing\nthe morals and doctrines of Jesus prevail; but where is the preliminary\n_judgment_, or decree? I cannot discover it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year,\nsaid unto them, Ye know nothing at all, nor consider, that it is expedient\nfor us, that one man should die for the people ... and he _prophesied_,\nthat Jesus should die for the nation of the Jews.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But to _prophesy_ is\nnot to _pass judgment_; and the individual opinion of Caiaphas, who was\nonly one among them, was not the opinion of all, nor a _judgment of the\nsenate_. We, therefore, still find a _judgment_ wanting; and we only\nobserve, that the priests and Pharisees are stimulated by a violent hatred\nof Jesus, and that \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom that day forth they took counsel together for _to\nput him to death; ut interficerent eum_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xi. 53.\n\nThe authority of St. John, then, is directly in contradiction of the\nassertion, that there was an _order of arrest_ previously passed by a\nregular tribunal.\n\nSt. Matthew, in relating the same facts, says, that the chief priests\nassembled at the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas, and\nthere held counsel together. But what counsel? and what was the result of\nit? Was it to issue an _order of arrest_ against Jesus, that they might\nhear him and then pass sentence? Not at all; but they held counsel\ntogether, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat they might take Jesus _by subtilty_, or _fraud_, and _kill\nhim_\u00e2\u0080\u009d; _concilium fecerunt_, _ut Jesum_ DOLO _tenerent et_ OCCIDERENT.\nMatt. xxvi. 5. Now in the Latin language, a language perfectly well\nconstituted in everything relating to terms of the law, the words\n_occidere_ and _interficere_ were never employed to express the act of\npassing _sentence_, or _judgment of death_, but simply to signify _murder_\nor _assassination_.(401)\n\nThis _fraud_, by the aid of which they were to get Jesus into their power,\nwas nothing but the bargain made between the chief priests and Judas.\n\nJudas, one of the twelve, goes to find the chief priests, and says to\nthem, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? Matt. xxvi.\n14, 15. And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver! Jesus,\nwho foresaw his treachery, warned him of it mildly, in the midst of the\nLast Supper, where the voice of his master, in the presence of his\nbrethren, should have touched him and awakened his reflections! But not\nso; wholly absorbed in his reward, Judas placed himself at the head of a\ngang of servants, to whom he was to point out Jesus; and, then, by a\n_kiss_ consummated his treachery!(402)\n\nIs it thus that a _judicial decree was to be executed_, if there had\nreally been one made for the arrest of Jesus?\n\nSection III.\u00e2\u0080\u0094PERSONAL LIBERTY.\u00e2\u0080\u0094RESISTANCE TO AN ARMED FORCE.\n\nThe act was done in the night time. After having celebrated the Supper,\nJesus had conducted his disciples to the Mount of Olives. He prayed\nfervently; but they fell asleep.\n\nJesus awakes them, with a gentle reproof for their weakness, and warns\nthem that the moment is approaching. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRise, let us be going; behold he is\nat hand that doth betray me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt. xxvi. 46.\n\nJudas was not alone; in his suite there was a kind of ruffian band, almost\nentirely composed of servants of the high priest, but whom Mr. Salvador\nhonours with the title of the _legal soldiery_. If in the crowd there were\nany Roman _soldiers_, they were there as spectators, and without having\nbeen legally called on duty; for the Roman commanding officer, Pilate, had\nnot yet heard the affair spoken of.\n\nThis personal seizure of Jesus had so much the appearance of a forcible\narrest, an illegal act of violence, that his disciples made preparation to\nrepel force by force.\n\nMalchus, the insolent servant of the high priest, having shown himself the\nmost eager to rush upon Jesus, Peter, not less zealous for his own master,\ncut off the servant\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right ear.\n\nThis resistance might have been continued with success, if Jesus had not\nimmediately interfered. But what proves that Peter, even while causing\nbloodshed, was not resisting a _legal order_, a _legal judgment_ or\ndecree, (which would have made his resistance an act of _rebellion by an\narmed force against a judicial order_,) is this\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he was not arrested,\neither at the moment or afterwards, at the house of the high priest, to\nwhich he followed Jesus, and where he was most distinctly recognised by\nthe maid servant of the high priest, and even by a relative of Malchus.\n\nJesus alone was arrested; and although he had not individually offered any\nactive resistance, and had even restrained that of his disciples, they\nbound him as a malefactor; which was a criminal degree of rigour, since\nfor the purpose of securing a single man by a numerous band of persons\narmed with swords and staves it was not necessary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe ye come out as\nagainst a thief with swords and staves?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke xxii. 52.\n\nSection IV.\u00e2\u0080\u0094OTHER IRREGULARITIES IN THE ARREST.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SEIZURE OF THE PERSON.\n\nThey dragged Jesus along with them; and, instead of taking him directly to\nthe proper magistrate, they carried him before Annas, who had no other\ncharacter than that of being _father-in-law to the high priest_. John\nxviii. 13. Now, if this was only for the purpose of letting him be seen by\nhim, such a curiosity was not to be gratified; it was a vexatious\nproceeding, an irregularity.\n\nFrom the house of Annas they led him to that of the high priest; all this\ntime being _bound_. John xviii. 24. They placed him in the court yard; it\nwas cold, and they made a fire; it was in the night time, but by the light\nof the fire Peter was recognised by the people of the palace.\n\nNow the Jewish law prohibited _all proceedings by night_; here, therefore,\nthere was another infraction of the law.\n\nUnder this state of things, his person being forcibly seized and detained\nin a private house, and delivered into the hands of servants, in the midst\nof a court, how was Jesus treated? St. Luke says, the men that held Jesus\n_mocked_ him and _smote_ him; and when they had blindfolded him, they\nstruck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that\nsmote thee? And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.\nLuke xxii. 63, 64, 65.\n\nWill it be said, as Mr. Salvador does, that all this took place out of the\npresence of the senate? Let us wait, in this instance, till the senate\nshall be called up, and we shall see how far they protected the accused\nperson.\n\nSection V.\u00e2\u0080\u0094CAPTIOUS INTERROGATORIES.\u00e2\u0080\u0094ACTS OF VIOLENCE TOWARDS JESUS.\n\nAlready had the cock crowed! But it was not yet day. The elders of the\npeople and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and, having\ncaused Jesus to appear before their council, they proceeded to interrogate\nhim. Luke xxii. 66.\n\nNow, in the outset, it should be observed, that if they had been less\ncarried away by their hatred, they should, as it was the _night time_, not\nonly have postponed, but put a stop to the proceedings, because it was\n_the feast of the Passover_, the most solemn of all festivals; and\naccording to their law no _judicial procedure_ could take place on a\nfeast-day, under the penalty of being null.(403) Nevertheless, let us see\nwho proceeded to interrogate Jesus. This was that same Caiaphas, who, if\nhe had intended to remain a _judge_, was evidently liable to objection;\nfor in the preceding assemblage he had made himself the _accuser_ of\nJesus.(404) Even before he had seen or heard him, he declared him to be\n_deserving of death_. He said to his colleagues, that \u00e2\u0080\u009cit was _expedient_\nthat one man should die for all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii. 14. Such being the opinion\nof Caiaphas, we shall not be surprised, if he shows partiality.\n\nInstead of interrogating Jesus respecting _positive acts done_, with their\ncircumstances, and respecting _facts personal to himself_, Caiaphas\ninterrogates him respecting _general facts_, respecting his disciples\n(whom it would have been much more simple to have called as witnesses),\nand respecting his _doctrine_, which was a mere abstraction so long as no\nexternal acts were the consequence of it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe high priest then asked\nJesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii. 19.\n\nJesus answered with dignity: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI spake openly to the world; I ever taught\nin the synagogue and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in\nsecret have I said nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 20.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy askest thou me? Ask them which heard me, _what I have said unto\nthem_; behold, they know what I said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 21.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck\nJesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest\nso?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 22.\n\nWill it here be still said, that this violence was the individual act of\nthe person who thus struck the accused? I answer, that on this occasion\nthe fact took place in the presence and under the eyes of the whole\ncouncil; and, as the high priest who presided did not restrain the author\nof it, I come to the conclusion, that he became an accomplice, especially\nwhen this violence was committed under the pretence of avenging the\nalleged affront to his dignity.\n\nBut in what respect could the answer of Jesus appear offensive? \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I have\nspoken evil,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jesus, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbear witness of the evil; but if well, why\nsmitest thou me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d(405) John xviii. 23.\n\nThere remained no mode of escaping from this dilemma. They accused Jesus;\nit was for those, who accused, to prove their accusation. An accused\nperson is not obliged to criminate himself. He should have been convicted\nby proofs; he himself called for them. Let us see what witnesses were\nproduced against him.\n\nSection VI.\u00e2\u0080\u0094WITNESSES.\u00e2\u0080\u0094NEW INTERROGATORIES.\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE JUDGE IN A PASSION.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against\nJesus to put him to death; and found none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mark xiv. 55.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor many bare _false witness_ against him, but their witness agreed not\ntogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 56.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd there arose certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, We\nheard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and\nwithin three days I will build another made without hands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 57, 58.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut (to the same point still) neither so did their witness agree\ntogether.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 59.\n\nMr. Salvador, on this subject, says, p. 87: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe two witnesses, whom St.\nMatthew and St. Mark charge with _falsehood_, narrate a discourse which\nSt. John declares to be _true_, so far as respects the power which Jesus\nChrist attributed to himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis alleged contradiction among the Evangelists does not exist. In the\nfirst place, St. Matthew does not say that the discourse was had by Jesus.\nIn chapter xxvi. 61, he states the depositions of the witnesses, but\nsaying at the same time that they were _false witnesses_; and in chapter\nxxvii. 40, he puts the same declaration into the mouth of those who\ninsulted Jesus at the foot of the cross; but he does not put it into the\nmouth of Christ. He is in accordance with St. Mark.\n\nSt. John, chapter ii. 19, makes Jesus speak in these words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cJesus\nanswered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will\nraise it up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And St. John adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe spake of the temple of his body.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus Jesus did not say in an affirmative and somewhat menacing manner, _I\nwill destroy this temple_, as the witnesses _falsely_ assumed; he only\nsaid, hypothetically, _Destroy this temple_, that is to say, suppose this\ntemple should be destroyed, I will raise it up in three days. Besides,\nthey could not dissemble, that he referred to a temple altogether\ndifferent from theirs, because he said, I will raise up another in three\ndays, _which will not be made by the hands of man_.\n\nIt hence results, at least, that the Jews did not understand him, for they\ncried out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cForty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou\nrear it up in three days?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThus, then, the witnesses did not agree together, and their declarations\nhad nothing conclusive. Mark xiv. 59. We must, therefore, look for other\nproofs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen the high priest, (we must not forget, that he is still the accuser,)\nthe high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, saying, Answerest\nthou nothing? what is it, which these witness against thee? But he held\nhis peace, and answered nothing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mark xiv. 60. In truth, since the\nquestion was not concerning the temple of the Jews, but an ideal temple,\nnot made by the hand of man, and which was alone in the thoughts of Jesus,\nthe explanation was to be found in the very evidence itself.\n\nThe high priest continued: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI adjure thee, by the living God, that thou\ntell us, whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt. xxvi. 63. I\nadjure thee, I call upon thee on oath! a gross infraction of that rule of\nmorals and jurisprudence, which forbids our placing an accused person\nbetween the danger of perjury and the fear of inculpating himself, and\nthus making his situation more hazardous. The high priest, however,\npersists, and says to him: Art thou the Christ, the Son of God?(406) Jesus\nanswered, _Thou hast said_. Matthew xxvi. 64; _I am_. Mark xiv. 62.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen the high priest rent his clothes, saying, _He hath spoken blasphemy;\nwhat further need have we of witnesses_? behold, now _ye have heard his\nblasphemy_. What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMatt. xxvi. 66.\n\nLet us now compare this scene of violence with the mild deduction of\nprinciples, which we find in the chapter of Mr. Salvador _On the\nAdministration of Justice_; and let us ask ourselves, if, as he alleges,\nwe find a just _application_ of them in the proceedings against Christ?\n\nDo we discover here that _respect_ of the Hebrew judge towards the party\naccused, when we see that Caiaphas permitted him to be struck, in his\npresence, _with impunity_?\n\nWhat was this Caiaphas, at once an accuser and judge?(407) A passionate\nman, and too much resembling the odious portrait which the historian\nJosephus has given us of him!(408) A judge, who was irritated to such a\ndegree, that he rent his clothes; who imposed upon the accused a most\nsolemn oath, and who gave to his answers the criminal character, that _he\nhad spoken_ blasphemy! And, from that moment, he wanted no more witnesses,\nnotwithstanding the law required them. He would not have an inquiry, which\nhe perceived would be insufficient; he attempts to supply it by captious\nquestions. He is desirous of having him condemned _upon his own\ndeclaration alone_, (interpreted, too, as he chooses to understand it,)\nthough that was forbidden by the laws of the Hebrews! And, in the midst of\na most violent transport of passion, this accuser himself, a high priest,\nwho means to speak in the name of the living God, is the first to pass\nsentence of death, and carries with him the opinions of the rest!\n\nIn this hideous picture I cannot recognise that justice of the Hebrews, of\nwhich Mr. Salvador has given so fine a view in _his theory_!\n\nSection VII.\u00e2\u0080\u0094SUBSEQUENT ACTS OF VIOLENCE.\n\nImmediately after this kind of sacerdotal verdict rendered against Jesus,\nthe acts of violence and insults recommenced with increased strength; the\nfury of the judge must have communicated itself to the bystanders. St.\nMatthew says: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and\nothers smote him with the palms of their hands, saying, Prophesy unto us,\nthou Christ; who is he that smote thee?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt. xxvi. 67, 68.\n\nMr. Salvador does not contest the truth of this ill treatment. In page 88\nhe says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was contrary to the spirit of the Hebrew law, and that it was\nnot according to the order of nature, that a senate composed of the most\nrespectable men of a nation,\u00e2\u0080\u0094that a senate, which might perhaps be\nmistaken, but which thought it was acting mildly, should have permitted\nsuch outrages against him whose life it held in its own hands. The writers\nwho have transmitted these details to us, not having been present\nthemselves at the trial, were disposed to overcharge the picture, either\non account of their own feelings, or to throw upon their judges a greater\nodium.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI repeat; this ill treatment was entirely contrary to the spirit of the\nlaw. And what do I want more, since my object is to make prominent _all\nthe violations of law_.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not in nature to see a body, which respects itself, authorize such\nattempts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But of what consequence is that, when the fact is established?\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe historians, it is said, were not present at the trial.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But was Mr.\nSalvador there present himself, so that he could give a flat denial of\ntheir statements? And when even an able writer, who was not an\neye-witness, relates the same events after the lapse of more than eighteen\ncenturies, he ought at least to bring opposing evidence, if he would\nimpeach that of contemporaries; who, if they were not in the very hall of\nthe council, were certainly on the spot, in the vicinity, perhaps in the\ncourt yard, inquiring anxiously of every thing that was happening to the\nman whose disciples they were.(409) Besides, the learned author whom I am\ncombating says, in the outset (p. 81), \u00e2\u0080\u009cit is from the Gospels themselves\nthat he will take all his facts.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He must then take the whole together, as\nwell those which go to condemn, as those which are in palliation or\nexcuse.\n\nThose gross insults, those inhuman acts of violence, even if they are to\nbe cast upon the servants of the high priest and the persons in his train,\ndo not excuse those individuals, who, when they took upon themselves the\nauthority of judges, were bound at the same time to throw around him all\nthe protection of the law. Caiaphas, too, was culpable as the master of\nthe house (for every thing took place in his house), even if he should not\nbe responsible as high priest and president of the council for having\npermitted excesses, which, indeed were but too much in accordance with the\nrage he had himself displayed upon the bench.\n\nThese outrages, which would be inexcusable even towards a man irrevocably\ncondemned to punishment, were the more criminal towards Jesus, because,\nlegally and judicially speaking, there had not yet been any sentence\nproperly passed against him according to the public law of the country; as\nwe shall see in the following section, which will deserve the undivided\nattention of the reader.\n\nSection VIII.\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE POSITION OF THE JEWS IN RESPECT TO THE ROMANS.\n\nWe must not forget, _that Judea was a conquered country_. After the death\nof Herod\u00e2\u0080\u0094most inappropriately surnamed _the Great_\u00e2\u0080\u0094Augustus had confirmed\nhis last will, by which that king of the Jews had arranged the division of\nhis dominions between _his_ two sons: but Augustus did not continue their\ntitle of _king_, which their father had borne.\n\nArchel\u00c3\u00a4us, on whom Judea devolved, having been recalled on account of his\ncruelties, the territory, which was at first intrusted to his command, was\nunited to the province of Syria. (_Josephus_, Antiq. Jud. lib. 17, cap.\n15.)\n\nAugustus then appointed particular officers for Judea. Tiberius did the\nsame; and at the time of which we are speaking, Pilate was one of those\nofficers. (_Josephus_, lib. 18, cap. 3 & 8.)\n\nSome have considered Pilate as governor, by title, and have given him the\nLatin appellation, _Pr\u00c3\u00a6ses_, president or governor. But they have mistaken\nthe force of the word. Pilate was one of those public officers, who were\ncalled by the Romans, _procuratores C\u00c3\u00a6saris_, Imperial procurators. With\nthis title of _procurator_, he was placed under the superior authority of\nthe governor of Syria, the true _pr\u00c3\u00a6ses_, or governor of that province, of\nwhich Judea was then only one of the dependencies.\n\nTo the governor (_pr\u00c3\u00a6ses_) peculiarly belonged the right of taking\ncognizance of _capital_ cases.(410) The _procurator_, on the contrary,\nhad, for his principal duty, nothing but the collection of the revenue,\nand the trial of revenue causes. But the right of taking cognizance of\n_capital_ cases did, in some instances, belong to certain _procurators_,\nwho were sent into small provinces to fill the places of governors (_vice\npr\u00c3\u00a6sides_), as appears clearly from the Roman laws.(411) Such was _Pilate_\nat Jerusalem.(412)\n\nThe Jews, placed in this political position\u00e2\u0080\u0094notwithstanding they were left\nin the enjoyment of their civil laws, the public exercise of their\nreligion, and many things merely relating to their police and municipal\nregulations\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Jews, I say, had not the _power of life and death_; this\nwas a principal attribute of sovereignty, which the Romans always took\ngreat care to reserve to themselves, even if they neglected other things.\n_Apud Romanos, jus valet gladii; c\u00c3\u00a6tera transmittuntur_. TACIT.\n\nWhat then was the right of the Jewish authorities in regard to Jesus?\nWithout doubt the scribes, and their friends the Pharisees, might well\nhave been alarmed, as a body and individually, at the preaching and\nsuccess of Jesus; they might be concerned for their worship; and they\nmight have interrogated the man respecting his creed and his\ndoctrines,\u00e2\u0080\u0094they might have made a kind of preparatory proceeding,\u00e2\u0080\u0094they\nmight have declared, in point of fact, that those doctrines, which\nthreatened their own, were contrary to their law, as understood by\nthemselves.\n\nBut that law, although it had not undergone any alteration as to the\naffairs of religion, had no longer any coercive power as to the external\nor civil regulations of society. In vain would they have undertaken to\npronounce sentence of death under the circumstances of the case of Jesus;\nthe council of the Jews had not the power to pass a _sentence of death_;\nit only would have had power to make _an accusation_ against him before\nthe governor, or his deputy, and then deliver him over to be tried by him.\n\nLet us distinctly establish this point; for here I entirely differ in\nopinion from Mr. Salvador. According to him, (p. 88), \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Jews had\n_reserved the power of trying, according to their law_; but it was in the\nhands of the _procurator_ alone, that the executive power was vested;\nevery culprit must be put to death by _his_ consent, in order that the\nsenate should not have the means of reaching persons that were sold to\nforeigners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo; the Jews had not reserved _the right of passing sentence of death_.\nThis right had been transferred to the Romans by the very act of conquest;\nand this was not merely that the senate should not have the means of\nreaching persons who were sold to foreign countries; but it was done, in\norder that the conqueror might be able to reach those individuals who\nshould become _impatient of the yoke_; it was, in short, for the equal\nprotection of all, as all had become Roman subjects; and to Rome alone\nbelonged the highest judicial power, which is the principal attribute of\nsovereignty. Pilate, as the representative of C\u00c3\u00a6sar in Judea, was not\nmerely an agent of the _executive authority_, which would have left the\n_judiciary_ and _legislative_ power in the hands of the conquered\npeople\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was not simply an officer appointed to give an _exequatur_ or\nmere approval (_visa_) to sentences passed by _another authority_, the\n_authority of the Jews_. When the matter in question was a _capital_ case,\nthe Roman authorities not only ordered the _execution_ of a sentence, but\nalso took cognizance (_cognitio_) of the crime; it had the right of\njurisdiction _\u00c3\u00a0 priori_, and that of _passing judgment in the last\nresort_. If Pilate himself had not had this power by special delegation,\n_vice pr\u00c3\u00a6sidis_, it was vested in the governor, within whose territorial\njurisdiction the case occurred; but in any event we hold it to be clear,\nthat the Jews had lost the right of _condemning to death_ any person\nwhatever, not only so far as respects the _execution_ but the _passing_ of\nthe sentence. This is one of the best settled points in the provincial law\nof the Romans.\n\nThe Jews were not ignorant of this; for when they went before Pilate, to\nask of him the condemnation of Jesus, they themselves declared, that it\nwas not permitted to them to put any person to death: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not lawful\nfor us to put any man to death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii. 31.\n\nHere I am happy to be able to support myself by the opinion of a very\nrespectable authority, the celebrated Loiseau, in his treatise on\n_Seigneuries_, in the chapter on the administration of _justice belonging\nto cities_. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says he, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is some evidence, that the\n_police_, in which the people had the sole interest, was administered by\nofficers of the people; but I know not upon what were founded the\nconcessions of power to some cities of France to exercise criminal\njurisdiction; nor why the Ordinance of Moulins left that to them rather\nthan civil cases; for the criminal jurisdiction is the _right of the\nsword_, the _merum imperium_, or absolute sovereignty. Accordingly, by the\nRoman law, the administration of justice was so far prohibited to the\nofficers of cities, that they could not punish even by a simple fine.\n_Thus it is doubtless that we must understand_ that passage of the Gospel,\nwhere the Jews say to Pilate, _It is not lawful for us to put any man to\ndeath_; for, after they were subjected to the Romans, they had not\njurisdiction of crimes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLet us now follow Jesus to the presence of Pilate.\n\nSection IX.\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE ACCUSATION MADE BEFORE PILATE.\n\nAt this point I must entreat the particular attention of the reader. The\nirregularities and acts of violence, which I have hitherto remarked upon,\nare nothing in comparison with the unbridled fury, which is about to\ndisplay itself before the _Roman Judge_, in order to extort from him,\nagainst his own conviction, a sentence of death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with\nthe elders, and scribes, and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and\ncarried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mark xv. 1.\n\n_As soon as the morning was come_; for, as I have observed already, every\nthing which had been done thus far against Jesus was done _during the\nnight_.\n\nThey then led Jesus from Caiaphas unto the Hall of Judgment of\nPilate.(413) It was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment\nhall, lest _they should be defiled_; but that they might eat the passover.\nJohn xviii. 28.\n\nSingular scrupulousness! and truly worthy of the Pharisees! They were\nafraid of _defiling themselves on the day of the passover_ by entering\n_the house of_ a heathen! And yet, the same day, only some hours before\npresenting themselves to Pilate, they had, in contempt of their own law,\ncommitted the outrage of _holding a council_ and deliberating upon _an\naccusation of a capital crime_.\n\nAs they would not enter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPilate went out to them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii. 29. Now\nobserve his language. He did not say to them, _Where is the sentence you\nhave passed_; as he must have done, if he was only to give them his simple\n_exequatur_, or permission to execute the sentence; but he takes up the\nmatter from the beginning, as would be done by one who had _plenary\njurisdiction_; and he says to them: What accusation bring ye against this\nman?\n\nThey answered, with their accustomed haughtiness: If he were not _a\nmalefactor_ we would not have delivered him up to thee. John xviii. 30.\nThey wished to have it understood, that, being a question of _blasphemy_,\nit was the _cause of their religion_, which they could appreciate better\nthan any others could. Pilate, then, would have been under the necessity\nof believing them _on their word_. But this Roman, indignant at their\nproposed course of proceeding, which would have restricted his\njurisdiction by making him the passive instrument of the wishes of the\nJews, answered them in an ironical manner: Well, since you say he has\nsinned against your law, take him yourselves and judge him according to\nyour law. John xviii. 31. This was an absolute mystification to them, for\nthey knew their own want of power to condemn him to death. But they were\nobliged to yield the point, and to submit to Pilate himself their\n_articles of accusation_.\n\nNow what were the grounds of this accusation? Were they _the same_ which\nhad hitherto been alleged against Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0094the charge of _blasphemy_\u00e2\u0080\u0094which\nwas the only one brought forward by Caiaphas before the council of the\nJews? Not at all; despairing of obtaining from the Roman judge a sentence\nof _death_ for a _religious_ quarrel, which was of no interest to the\nRomans,(414) they suddenly changed their plan; they abandoned their first\naccusation, the charge of blasphemy, and substituted for it a _political_\naccusation, an _offence against the state_.\n\nHere we have the very crisis, or essential incident, of the passion; and\nthat which makes the heaviest accusation of guilt on the part of the\ninformers against Jesus. For, being fully bent on destroying him in any\nmanner whatever, they no longer exhibited themselves as the avengers of\n_their religion_, which was alleged to have been outraged, or of their\nworship, which it was pretended was threatened; but, ceasing to appear as\nJews, in order to affect sentiments belonging to a foreign nation, those\nhypocrites held out the appearance of being concerned for the interests of\n_Rome_; they accused their own countryman of an intention to restore the\nkingdom of Jerusalem, to make himself _king_ of the _Jews_, and to make an\ninsurrection of the people against their conquerors. Let us hear them\nspeak for themselves:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd they began to _accuse_ him, saying, We found this fellow perverting\nthe nation, and forbidding to give tribute to C\u00c3\u00a6sar, saying, that he\nhimself is Christ a _king_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke xxiii. 2.\n\nWhat a calumny! Jesus forbidding to give tribute to C\u00c3\u00a6sar! when he had\nanswered the Pharisees themselves, in presence of the whole people, by\nshowing them the image of C\u00c3\u00a6sar upon a Roman piece of money, and saying,\nGive unto C\u00c3\u00a6sar the things which are C\u00c3\u00a6sar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. But this accusation was one\nmode of interesting Pilate in respect to his jurisdiction; for, as an\nimperial _procurator_, he was specially to superintend the collection of\nthe revenue. The second branch of the accusation still more directly\naffected the sovereignty of the Romans: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe holds himself up for a\n_king_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe accusation having thus assumed a character purely _political_, Pilate\nthought he must pay attention to it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen Pilate entered into the\njudgment hall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (the place where justice was administered,) and having\n_summoned Jesus to appear_ before him, he proceeds to his Examination, and\nsays to him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cArt thou the king of the Jews?\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii. 33.\n\nThis question, so different from those which had been addressed to him at\nthe house of the high priest, appears to have excited the astonishment of\nJesus; and, in his turn, he asked Pilate: \u00e2\u0080\u009cSayest thou this thing of\nthyself, or did others tell it thee of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 24. In reality, Jesus was\ndesirous of knowing, first of all, the authors of this new accusation\u00e2\u0080\u0094Is\nthis an accusation brought against me by the _Romans_ or by the _Jews_?\n\nPilate replied to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests\nhave delivered thee unto me; what hast thou done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib. 35.\n\nAll the particulars of this procedure are important; I cannot too often\nrepeat the remark, that in no part of the transactions before Pilate is\nthere any question at all respecting a previous sentence, a judgment\nalready passed\u00e2\u0080\u0094a judgment, the execution of which was the only subject of\nconsideration; it was a case of a capital accusation; but an accusation\nwhich was then just beginning; they were about the preliminary\n_interrogatories_ put to the accused, and Pilate says to him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat hast\nthou done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJesus, seeing by the explanation what was the source of the _prejudging_\nof his case, and knowing the secret thoughts which predominated in making\nthe accusation, and that his enemies wanted to arrive at the same end by\nan artifice, answered Pilate\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c_My kingdom is not of this world_; if my\nkingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should\nnot be delivered to the Jews;\u00e2\u0080\u009d (we see, in fact, that Jesus had forbidden\nhis people to resist) but, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cnow is my kingdom not from hence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nJohn xviii. 36.\n\nThis answer of Jesus is very remarkable; it became the foundation of his\nreligion, and the pledge of its universality, because it detached it from\nthe interests of all governments. It rests not merely in assertion, in\ndoctrine; it was given in _justification_, in _defence_ against the\naccusation of intending to make himself _King of the Jews_. Indeed, if\nJesus had affected a _temporal_ royal authority, if there had been the\nleast attempt, on his part, to usurp _the power of C\u00c3\u00a6sar_, he would have\nbeen guilty of treason in the eyes of the magistrate. But, by answering\ntwice, _my kingdom is not of this world_, my kingdom _is not from hence_,\nhis justification was complete.\n\nPilate, however, persisted and said to him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cArt thou a king then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jesus\nreplied, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for\nthis cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the\ntruth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice. John xviii. 37.\n\nPilate then said to him: _What is the truth?_\n\nThis question proves, that Pilate had not a very clear idea of what Jesus\ncalled _the truth_. He perceived nothing in it but _ideology_; and,\nsatisfied with having said (less in the manner of a question than of an\nexclamation) \u00e2\u0080\u009c_What is the truth_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he went on to the Jews (who remained\noutside) and said to them, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_I find in him no fault at all_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii.\n38.\n\nHere, then, we see Jesus absolved from the accusation by the declaration\nof the Roman judge himself.\n\nBut the accusers, persisting still farther, added\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c_He stirreth up the\npeople, teaching_ throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this\nplace.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke xxiii. 5.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stirreth up the people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a charge of sedition; and for Pilate.\nBut observe, it was _by the doctrine which he teaches_; these words\ncomprehend the real complaint of the Jews. To them it was equivalent to\nsaying\u00e2\u0080\u0094He _teaches_ the people, he instructs them, he enlightens them; he\npreaches _new doctrines_ which are not _ours_. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe stirs up the people!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThis, in their months signified\u00e2\u0080\u0094the people hear him willingly; the people\nfollow and become attached to him; for he preaches a doctrine that is\nfriendly and consolatory to the people; he unmasks our pride, our avarice,\nour insatiable spirit of domination!\n\nPilate, however, does not appear to have attached much importance to this\nnew turn given to the accusation; but he here betrays a weakness. He heard\nthe word _Galilee_; and he makes that the occasion of shifting off the\nresponsibility upon another public officer, and seizes the occasion with\navidity. He says to Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0094you are a _Galilean_ then? and, upon the answer\nbeing in the affirmative, considering Jesus as belonging to the\njurisdiction of Herod-Antipas, who, by the good pleasure of C\u00c3\u00a6sar, was\nthen tetrarch of Galilee, he sent him to Herod. Luke xxiii. 6, 7.\n\nBut Herod, who, as St. Luke says, had been long desirous of _seeing Jesus_\nand had hoped to see some  miracle  done by him, after satisfying an idle\ncuriosity and putting several questions to him, which Jesus did not deign\nto answer,\u00e2\u0080\u0094Herod, notwithstanding the presence of the priests, (who had\nnot yet gone off, but stood there with their scribes,) and notwithstanding\nthe pertinacity with which they continued to accuse Jesus, perceiving\nnothing but what was merely chimerical in the _accusation of being a\nking_, made a mockery of the affair, and sent Jesus back to Pilate, _after\nhaving arrayed him in a gorgeous robe_, in order to show that he thought\nthis pretended royalty was a subject of ridicule rather than of\napprehensions. Luke xxiii. 8, &c., and De Sacy. Ib.\n\nSection X.\u00e2\u0080\u0094THE LAST EFFORTS BEFORE PILATE.\n\nNo person, then, was willing to condemn Jesus; neither Herod, who only\nmade the case a subject of mockery, nor Pilate, who had openly declared\nthat he found nothing criminal in him.\n\nBut the hatred of the priests was not disarmed\u00e2\u0080\u0094so far from it, that the\nchief priests, with a numerous train of their partisans, returned to\nPilate with a determination to force him to a decision.\n\nThe unfortunate Pilate, reviewing his proceedings in their presence, said\nto them again: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYe have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth\nthe people\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, behold, I, having examined him before you, _have found no\nfault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him_: No, nor\nyet Herod; for I sent you to him, and lo, _nothing worthy of death is done\nunto him_. I will therefore chastise him and release him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke xxiii. 14,\n15.\n\nAfter \u00e2\u0080\u009cchastising\u00e2\u0080\u009d him! And was not this a piece of cruelty, when he\nconsidered him to be innocent?(415) But this was an act of condescension\nby which Pilate hoped to quiet the rage with which he saw they were\nagitated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xix. 1. And,\nsupposing that he had done enough to disarm their fury, he exhibited him\nto them in that pitiable condition; saying to them at the same time,\nBehold the man! _Ecce homo_. John xix. 5.\n\nNow, in my turn, I say, here is indeed a decree of Pilate, and an unjust\ndecree; but it is not the pretended decree alleged to have been made by\nthe Jews. It is a decision wholly different; an unjust decision, it is\ntrue; but sufficient to avail as _a legal bar_ to any new proceedings\nagainst Jesus for the same act. _Non bis in idem_, no man shall be put\ntwice in jeopardy, &c. is a maxim, which has come down to us from the\nRomans.\n\nAccordingly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom thenceforth Pilate sought to _release_ Jesus.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John\nxix. 12.\n\nHere, now, observe the deep perfidy of his accusers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf thou let this man\ngo, thou art not C\u00c3\u00a6sar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend; whosoever maketh himself a _king_\nspeaketh against C\u00c3\u00a6sar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ib.\n\nIt does not appear that Pilate was malignant; we see all the efforts he\nhad made at different times to save Jesus. But he was a _public officer_,\nand was attached to _his office_; he was intimidated by the outcry which\ncalled in question his _fidelity to the emperor_; he was afraid of a\n_dismissal_: and he yielded. He immediately reascended the judgment-seat;\n(Matt. xxvii. 19), and, as new light had thus come upon him, he proceeded\nto make a second decree!\n\nBut being for a moment stopped by the voice of his own conscience, and by\nthe advice which his terrified wife sent to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009c_Have thou nothing to do\nwith that just man_\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094(Matt. xxvii. 19)\u00e2\u0080\u0094he made his last effort, by\nattempting to influence the populace to accept of Barabbas instead of\nJesus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather\nrelease Barabbas unto them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mark xv. 11. Barabbas! a murderer! an\nassassin!\n\nPilate spoke to them again: _What will ye then, that I should do with\nJesus?_ And they cried out, _Away with him, crucify him_. Pilate still\npersisted: _Shall I crucify your king?_ thus using terms of raillery, in\norder to disarm them. But here showing themselves to be more truly Roman\nthan Pilate himself, the chief priests hypocritically answered: _We have\nno king but C\u00c3\u00a6sar._ John xix. 15.\n\nThe outcry was renewed\u00e2\u0080\u0094Crucify him, crucify him! And the clamour became\nmore and more threatening; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand the voices of them and of the chief\npriests prevailed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke xxiii. 23.\n\nAt length Pilate, _being desirous of pleasing the multitude_, proceeds to\nspeak. But can we call it a legal adjudication, a _judgment_, that he is\nabout to pronounce? Is he, at the moment, in that free state of mind which\nis necessary for a judge, who is about to pass a _sentence of death_? What\nnew witnesses, what proofs have been brought forward to change his\nconviction and opinion, which had been so energetically declared, of the\ninnocence of Jesus?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult\nwas made, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying,\n_I am innocent of the blood of this just person_; see ye to it. Matt.\nxxvii. 24. And Pilate gave sentence, that it should be as they required.\nLuke xxiii. 24. And he delivered him to them to be crucified.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matt.\nxxvii. 26.\n\nWell mayest thou wash thy hands, Pilate, stained as they are with innocent\nblood! Thou hast authorised the act in thy weakness; thou art not less\nculpable, than if thou hadst sacrificed him through wickedness! All\ngenerations, down to our own time, have repeated that the _Just One_\nsuffered _under Pontius Pilate_. Thy name has remained in history, to\nserve for the instruction of all public men, all pusillanimous judges, in\norder to hold up to them the shame of _yielding contrary to one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own\nconvictions_. The populace, in its fury, made an outcry at the foot of thy\njudgment-seat, where, perhaps, thou thyself didst not sit securely! But of\nwhat importance was that? Thy _duty_ spoke out; and in such a case, better\nwould it be to suffer death, than to inflict it on another.(416)\n\nWe will now come to a conclusion.\n\nThe _proof_ that Jesus was not, as Mr. Salvador maintains, put to death\nfor the crime of blasphemy or sacrilege, and for having preached a new\nreligious worship in contravention of the Mosaic law, results from _the\nvery sentence_ pronounced by Pilate; a sentence, in pursuance of which he\nwas led to execution by Roman soldiers.\n\nThere was among the Romans a custom, which we borrowed from their\njurisprudence, and which is still followed, of placing over the head of a\ncondemned criminal a writing containing _an extract from his sentence_, in\norder that the public might know _for what crime_ he was condemned. This\nwas the reason why Pilate put on the cross a label, on which he had\nwritten these words: _Jesus Nazarenus Rex Jud\u00c3\u00a6orum_, (Jesus of Nazareth,\nKing of the Jews), which has since been denoted by the initials J. N. R.\nJ. This was the alleged cause of his condemnation. St. Mark says\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the\nsuperscription of his _accusation_ was written over\u00e2\u0080\u0094_The King of the\nJews_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mark xv. 26.\n\nThis inscription was first in _Latin_, which was the legal language of the\n_Roman_ judge; and it was repeated in _Hebrew_ and _Greek_, in order to be\nunderstood by the people of the nation and by foreigners.\n\nThe chief priests, whose indefatigable hatred did not overlook the most\nminute details, being apprehensive that people would take it to be\nliterally a fact affirmed, that Jesus _was the King of the Jews_, said to\nPilate: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWrite not _King of the Jews_, but that _he said_ I am king of the\nJews.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But Pilate answered: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I have written I have written.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John\nxix. 21, 22.\n\nThis is a conclusive answer to one of the last assertions of Mr. Salvador,\n(p. 88,) that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe Roman Pilate signed the sentence;\u00e2\u0080\u009d by which he always\nmeans that Pilate did nothing but sign a sentence, which he supposes to\nhave been passed by the Sanhedrim; but in this he is mistaken. Pilate did\nnot merely _sign_ the sentence, or decree, but _drew it up_; and, when his\ndraft was objected to by the priests, he still adhered to it, saying, what\nI have written shall remain as written.\n\nHere then we see the true cause of the condemnation of Jesus! Here we have\nthe \u00e2\u0080\u009c_judicial and legal proof_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jesus was the victim of a _political_\naccusation! He was put to death for the imaginary crime of having aimed at\nthe power of C\u00c3\u00a6sar, by calling himself _King of the Jews_! Absurd\naccusation; which Pilate never believed, and which the chief priests and\nthe Pharisees themselves did not believe. For they were not authorized to\narrest Jesus on that account; it was a new, and totally different,\naccusation from that which they first planned\u00e2\u0080\u0094a sudden accusation of the\nmoment, when they saw that Pilate was but little affected by their\n_religious_ zeal, and they found it necessary to arouse _his zeal for_\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c_If thou let this man go, thou art not C\u00c3\u00a6sar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s friend!_\u00e2\u0080\u009d This alarming\nlanguage has too often, since that time, reverberated in the ears of timid\njudges, who, like Pilate, have rendered themselves criminal by delivering\nup victims through want of firmness, whom they would never have condemned,\nif they had listened to the voice of their own consciences.\n\nLet us now recapitulate the case, as I have considered it from the\nbeginning.\n\nIs it not evident, contrary to the conclusion of Mr. Salvador, that Jesus,\nconsidered merely as _a simple citizen_, was not tried and sentenced\neither _according to law_, or _agreeably to the forms of legal proceedings\nthen existing_?\n\nGod, according to his eternal design, might permit the just to suffer by\nthe malice of men; but he also intended, that this should at least happen\nby a disregard of all laws, and by a violation of all established rules,\nin order that the entire contempt of forms should stand as the first\nwarning of the violation of law.\n\nLet us not be surprised then, that in another part of his work, Mr.\nSalvador (who, it is gratifying to observe, discusses his subject\ndispassionately) expresses some regret in speaking of the \u00e2\u0080\u009c_unfortunate\nsentence against Jesus_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Vol. i. p. 59. He has wished to excuse the\nHebrews; but, one of that nation, in giving utterance to the feelings of\nhis heart, still says\u00e2\u0080\u0094in language which I took from his own mouth, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\nshould be very cautious of condemning him at this day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nI pass over the excesses which followed the order of Pilate; as, the\nviolence shown to Simon, the Cyrenian, who was made in some degree a\nsharer in the punishment, by being compelled to carry the cross; the\ninjurious treatment which attended the victim to the place of the\nsacrifice, and even to the cross, where Jesus still prayed for his\nbrethren and his executioners!\n\nTo the heathen themselves I would say\u00e2\u0080\u0094You, who have gloried in the death\nof Socrates, how much must you be struck with wonder at that of Jesus! Ye,\ncensors of the Areopagus, how could you undertake to excuse the Synagogue,\nand justify the sentence of the Hall of Judgment? Philosophy herself has\nnot hesitated to proclaim, and we may repeat with her\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, if the life\nand death of _Socrates_ were those of a sage, the life and death of\n_Jesus_ were those of a divinity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n\n    1 Cicero, Philip.

Evid. pp. 16, 480, 521.\n\n   51 This subject has been treated by Dr. Chalmers, in his Evidences of\n      the Christian Revelation, chapter iii. The following extract from\n      his observations will not be unacceptable to the reader. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn other\n      cases, when we compare the narratives of contemporary historians, it\n      is not expected that all the circumstances alluded to by one will be\n      taken notice of by the rest; and it often happens that an event or a\n      custom is admitted upon the faith of a single historian; and the\n      silence of all other writers is not suffered to attach suspicion or\n      discredit to his testimony. It is an allowed principle, that a\n      scrupulous resemblance betwixt two histories is very far from\n      necessary to their being held consistent with one another. And what\n      is more, it sometimes happens that, with contemporary historians,\n      there may be an apparent contradiction, and the credit of both\n      parties remain as entire and unsuspicious as before. Posterity is,\n      in these cases, disposed to make the most liberal allowances.\n      Instead of calling it a contradiction, they often call it a\n      difficulty. They are sensible that, in many instances a seeming\n      variety of statement has, upon a more extensive knowledge of ancient\n      history, admitted of a perfect reconciliation. Instead, then, of\n      referring the difficulty in question to the inaccuracy or bad faith\n      of any of the parties, they, with more justness and more modesty,\n      refer it to their own ignorance, and to that obscurity which\n      necessarily hangs over the history of every remote age. These\n      principles are suffered to have great influence in every secular\n      investigation; but so soon as, instead of a secular, it becomes a\n      sacred investigation, every ordinary principle is abandoned, and the\n      suspicion annexed to the teachers of religion is carried to the\n      dereliction of all that candour and liberality with which every\n      other document of antiquity is judged of and appreciated. How does\n      it happen that the authority of Josephus should be acquiesced in as\n      a first principle, while every step, in the narrative of the\n      evangelists, must have foreign testimony to confirm and support it?\n      How comes it, that the silence of Josephus should be construed into\n      an impeachment of the testimony of the evangelists, while it is\n      never admitted, for a single moment, that the silence of the\n      evangelists can impart the slightest blemish to the testimony of\n      Josephus? How comes it, that the supposition of two Philips in one\n      family should throw a damp of scepticism over the Gospel narrative,\n      while the only circumstance which renders that supposition necessary\n      is the single testimony of Josephus; in which very testimony it is\n      necessarily implied that there are two Herods in that same family?\n      How comes it, that the evangelists, with as much internal, and a\n      vast deal more of external evidence in their favour, should be made\n      to stand before Josephus, like so many prisoners at the bar of\n      justice? In any other case, we are convinced that this would be\n      looked upon as _rough handling_. But we are not sorry for it. It has\n      given more triumph and confidence to the argument. And it is no\n      small addition to our faith, that its first teachers have survived\n      an examination, which, in point of rigour and severity, we believe\n      to be quite unexampled in the annals of criticism.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See Chalmers\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      Evidences, pp. 72-74.\n\n   52 See 1 Stark. Evid. pp. 480, 545.\n\n   53 If the witnesses could be supposed to have been biassed, this would\n      destroy their testimony to matters of fact; it would only detract\n      from the weight of their judgment in matters of opinion. The rule of\n      law on this subject has been thus stated by Dr. Lushington: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen\n      you examine the testimony of witnesses nearly connected with the\n      parties, and there is nothing very peculiar tending to destroy their\n      credit, when they depose to mere facts, their testimony is to be\n      believed; when they depose as to matter of opinion, it is to be\n      received with suspicion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dillon _v._ Dillon, 3 Curteis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Eccl. Rep.\n      pp. 96, 102.\n\n   54 This subject has been so fully treated by Dr. Paley, in his view of\n      the Evidences of Christianity, Part I., Prop. I., that is it\n      unnecessary to pursue it farther in this place.\n\n   55 1 Stark. Evid., pp. 483, 548.\n\n   56 Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Philosophy of Rhetoric, c. v. b. 1.

These narrators were,\n      the Duchess D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Angoul\u00c3\u00aame herself, the two Messrs. De Bouill\u00c3\u00a8, the Duc\n      De Choiseul, his servant, James Brissac, Messrs. De Damas and\n      Deslons, two of the officers commanding detachments on the road,\n      Messrs. De Moustier and Valori, the garde du corps who accompanied\n      the king, and finally M. de Fontanges, archbishop of Toulouse, who\n      though not himself a party to the transaction, is supposed to have\n      written from the information of the queen. An earlier instance of\n      similar discrepancy is mentioned by Sully. After the battle of\n      Aumale, in which Henry IV. was wounded, when the officers were\n      around the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bed, conversing upon the events of the day, there\n      were not two who agreed in the recital of the most particular\n      circumstances of the action. D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Aubign\u00c3\u00a9, a contemporary writer, does\n      not even mention the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wound, though it was the only one he\n      ever received in his life. See Memoirs of Sully, vol. i. p. 245. If\n      we treated these narratives as sceptics would have us treat these of\n      the sacred writers, what evidence should we have of any battle at\n      Aumale, or of any flight to Varennes?\n\n   58 Far greater discrepancies can be found in the different reports of\n      the same case, given by the reporters of legal judgments than are\n      shown among the evangelists; and yet we do not consider them as\n      detracting from the credit of the reporters, to whom we still resort\n      with confidence, as to good authority. Some of these discrepancies\n      seem utterly irreconcilable. Thus, in a case, 45 Edw. III. 19, where\n      the question was upon a gift of lands to J. de C. with Joan, the\n      sister of the donor, and to their heirs, Fitzherbert (tit. _Tail_,\n      14) says it was adjudged fee simple, and not frankmarriage; Statham\n      (tit. _Tail_) says it was adjudged a gift in frankmarriage; while\n      Brook (tit. _Frankmarriage_) says it was not decided. (Vid. 10 Co.\n      118.) Others are irreconcilable, until the aid of a third reporter\n      is invoked. Thus, in the case of Cooper v. Franklin, Croke says it\n      was not decided, but adjourned; (Cro. Jac. 100); Godbolt says it was\n      decided in a certain way, which he mentions; (Godb. 269); Moor also\n      reports it as decided, but gives a different account of the question\n      raised; (Moor, 848); while Bulstrode gives a still different report\n      of the judgment of the court, which he says was delivered by Croke\n      himself. But by his account it further appears, that the case was\n      previously twice argued; and thus it at length results that the\n      other reporters relate only what fell from the court on each of the\n      previous occasions. Other similar examples may be found in 1 Dougl.\n      6, n. compared with 5 East, 475, n. in the case of Galbraith _v_.\n      Neville; and in that of Stoughton _v_. Reynolds, reported by\n      Fortescue, Strange, and in Cases temp. Hardwicke. (See 3 Barnw. &\n      Ald. 247, 248.) Indeed, the books abound in such instances. Other\n      discrepancies are found in the names of the same litigating parties,\n      as differently given by reporters; such as, Putt _v_. Roster, (2\n      Mod. 318); Foot _v_. Rastall, (Skin. 49), and Putt _v_. Royston, (2\n      Show. 211); also, Hosdell _v_. Harris, (2 Keb. 462); Hodson _v_.\n      Harwich, (Ib. 533), and Hodsden _v_. Harridge, (2 Saund. 64), and a\n      multitude of others, which are universally admitted to mean the same\n      cases, even when they are not precisely within the rule of _idem\n      sonans_. These diversities, it is well known, have never detracted\n      in the slightest degree from the estimation in which the reporters\n      are all deservedly held, as authors of merit, enjoying, to this day,\n      the confidence of the profession. Admitting now, for the sake of\n      argument, (what is not conceded in fact,) that diversities equally\n      great exist among the sacred writers; how can we consistently, and\n      as lawyers, raise any serious objection against them on that\n      account, or treat them in any manner different from that which we\n      observe towards our own reporters?\n\n   59 Mr. Hume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument is thus refuted by Lord Brougham. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHere are two\n      answers, to which the doctrine proposed by Mr. Hume is exposed, and\n      either appears sufficient to shake it.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c_First_\u00e2\u0080\u0094Our belief in the uniformity of the laws of nature rests\n      not altogether upon our own experience. We believe no man ever was\n      raised from the dead,\u00e2\u0080\u0094not merely because we ourselves never saw it,\n      for indeed that would be a very limited ground of deduction; and our\n      belief was fixed on the subject long before we had any considerable\n      experience,\u00e2\u0080\u0094fixed chiefly by authority,\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, by deference to\n      other men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience. We found our confident belief in this\n      negative position partly, perhaps chiefly, upon the testimony of\n      others; and at all events, our belief that in times before our own\n      the same position held good, must of necessity be drawn from our\n      trusting relations of other men\u00e2\u0080\u0094that is, it depends upon the\n      evidence of testimony. If, then, the existence of the law of nature\n      is proved, in great part at least, by such evidence, can we wholly\n      reject the like evidence when it comes to prove an exception to the\n      rule\u00e2\u0080\u0094a deviation from the law? The more numerous are the cases of\n      the law being kept\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more rare those of its being broken\u00e2\u0080\u0094the more\n      scrupulous certainly ought we to be in admitting the proofs of the\n      breach. But that testimony is capable of making good the proof there\n      seems no doubt. In truth, the degree of excellence and of strength\n      to which testimony may arise seems almost indefinite. There is\n      hardly any cogency which it is not capable by possible supposition\n      of attaining. The endless multiplication of witnesses,\u00e2\u0080\u0094the unbounded\n      variety of their habits of thinking, their prejudices, their\n      interests,\u00e2\u0080\u0094afford the means of conceiving the force of their\n      testimony, augmented _ad infinitum_, because these circumstances\n      afford the means of diminishing indefinitely the chances of their\n      being mistaken, all misled, or all combining to deceive us. Let any\n      man try to calculate the chances of a thousand persons who come from\n      different quarters, and never saw each other before, and who all\n      vary in their habits, stations, opinions, interests,\u00e2\u0080\u0094being mistaken\n      or combining to deceive us, when they give the same account of an\n      event as having happened before their eyes,\u00e2\u0080\u0094these chances are many\n      hundreds of thousands to one. And yet we can conceive them\n      multiplied indefinitely; for one hundred thousand such witnesses may\n      in all like manner bear the same testimony; and they may all tell us\n      their story within twenty-four hours after the transaction, and in\n      the next parish. And yet, according to Mr. Hume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument, we are\n      bound to disbelieve them all, because they speak to a thing contrary\n      to our own experience, and to the accounts which other witnesses had\n      formerly given us of the law of nature, and which our forefathers\n      had handed down to us as derived from witnesses who lived in the old\n      time before them. It is unnecessary to add that no testimony of the\n      witnesses, whom we are supposing to concur in their relation,\n      contradicts any testimony of our own senses. If it did, the argument\n      would resemble Archbishop Tillotson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s upon the Real Presence, and\n      our disbelief would be at once warranted.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c_Secondly_\u00e2\u0080\u0094This leads us to the next objection to which Mr. Hume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      argument is liable, and which we have in part anticipated while\n      illustrating the first. He requires us to withhold our belief in\n      circumstances which would force every man of common understanding to\n      lend his assent, and to act upon the supposition of the story told\n      being true. For, suppose either such numbers of various witnesses as\n      we have spoken of; or, what is perhaps stronger, suppose a miracle\n      reported to us, first by a number of relators, and then by three or\n      four of the very soundest judges and most incorruptibly honest men\n      we know,\u00e2\u0080\u0094men noted for their difficult belief of wonders, and, above\n      all, steady unbelievers in miracles, without any bias in favour of\n      religion, but rather accustomed to doubt, if not disbelieve,\u00e2\u0080\u0094most\n      people would lend an easy belief to any miracles thus vouched. But\n      let us add this circumstance, that a friend on his death-bed had\n      been attended by us, and that we had told him a fact known only to\n      ourselves,\u00e2\u0080\u0094something that we had secretly done the very moment\n      before we told it to the dying man, and which to no other being we\n      had ever revealed,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and that the credible witnesses we are supposing,\n      informed us that the deceased appeared to them, conversed with them,\n      remained with them a day or two, accompanying them, and to avouch\n      the fact of his reappearance on this earth, communicated to them the\n      secret of which we had made him the sole depository the moment\n      before his death;\u00e2\u0080\u0094according to Mr. Hume, we are bound rather to\n      believe, not only that those credible witnesses deceive us, or that\n      those sound and unprejudiced men were themselves deceived, and\n      fancied things without real existence, but further, that they all\n      hit by chance upon the discovery of a real secret, known only to\n      ourselves and the dead man. Mr. Hume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument requires us to\n      believe this as the lesser improbability of the two\u00e2\u0080\u0094as less unlikely\n      than the rising of one from the dead; and yet every one must feel\n      convinced, that were he placed in the situation we have been\n      figuring, he would not only lend his belief to the relation, but if\n      the relators accompanied it with a special warning from the deceased\n      person to avoid a certain contemplated act, he would, acting upon\n      the belief of their story, take the warning, and avoid doing the\n      forbidden deed. Mr. Hume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument makes no exception. This is its\n      scope; and whether he chooses to push it thus far or no, all\n      miracles are of necessity denied by it, without the least regard to\n      the kind or the quantity of the proof on which they are rested; and\n      the testimony which we have supposed, accompanied by the test or\n      check we have supposed, would fall within the grasp of the argument\n      just as much and as clearly as any other miracle avouched by more\n      ordinary combinations of evidence.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe use of Mr. Hume\u00e2\u0080\u0099s argument is this, and it is an important and\n      a valuable one. It teaches us to sift closely and rigorously the\n      evidence for miraculous events. It bids us remember that the\n      probabilities are always, and must always be incomparably greater\n      against, than for, the truth of these relations, because it is\n      always far more likely that the testimony should be mistaken or\n      false, than that the general laws of nature should be suspended.\n      Further than this the doctrine cannot in soundness of reason be\n      carried. It does not go the length of proving that those general\n      laws cannot, by the force of human testimony, be shown to have been,\n      in a particular instance, and with a particular purpose, suspended.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      See his Discourse of Natural Theology, Note 5, p. 210-214. (Ed.\n      1835.)\n\n      Laplace, in his Essai sur les Probabilit\u00c3\u00a9s, maintains that, the more\n      extraordinary the fact attested, the greater the probability of\n      error or falsehood in the attestor. Simple good sense, he says,\n      suggests this; and the calculation of probabilities confirms its\n      suggestion. There are some things, he adds, so extraordinary, that\n      nothing can balance their improbability. The position here laid down\n      is, that the probability of error, or of the falsehood of testimony,\n      becomes in _proportion_ greater, as the fact which is attested is\n      more extraordinary. And hence a fact extraordinary in the highest\n      possible degree, becomes in the highest possible degree improbable;\n      or so much so, that nothing can counterbalance its improbability.\n\n      This argument has been made much use of, to discredit the evidence\n      of miracles, and the truth of that divine religion which is attested\n      by them. But however sound it may be, in one sense, this application\n      of it is fallacious. The fallacy lies in the meaning affixed to the\n      term \u00e2\u0080\u009cextraordinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Laplace means a fact extraordinary _under_\n      its existing circumstances and relations, that is, a fact remaining\n      extraordinary, notwithstanding all its circumstances, the position\n      need not here to be controverted. But if the term means\n      extraordinary _in the abstract_, it is far from being universally\n      true, or affording a correct test of truth, or rule of evidence.\n      Thus, it is extraordinary that a man should leap fifteen feet at a\n      bound; but not extraordinary that a strong and active man should do\n      it, under a sudden impulse to save his life. The former is\n      improbable in the abstract; the latter is rendered probable by the\n      circumstances. So, things extraordinary, and therefore improbable\n      under one hypothesis, become the reverse under another. Thus, the\n      occurrence of a violent storm at sea, and the utterance by Jesus of\n      the the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cPeace, be still,\u00e2\u0080\u009d succeeded instantly by a perfect\n      calm, are facts which, taken separately from each other, are not in\n      themselves extraordinary. The connexion between the command of Jesus\n      and the ensuing calm, as cause and effect, would be extraordinary\n      and improbable if he were a mere man; but it becomes perfectly\n      natural and probable, when his divine power is considered. Each of\n      those facts is in its nature so simple and obvious, that the most\n      ignorant person is capable of observing it. There is nothing\n      extraordinary in the facts themselves; and the extraordinary\n      coincidence, in which the miracle consists, becomes both\n      intelligible and probable upon the hypothesis of the Christian. (See\n      the Christian Observer for Oct. 1838, p. 617.) The theory of Laplace\n      may, with the same propriety, be applied to the creation of the\n      world. That matter was created out of nothing is extremely\n      improbable, in the abstract, that is, if there is no God; and\n      therefore it is not to be believed. But if the existence of a\n      Supreme Being is conceded, the fact is perfectly credible.\n\n      Laplace was so fascinated with his theory, that he thought the\n      calculus of probabilities might be usefully employed in discovering\n      the value of the different methods resorted to, in those sciences\n      which are in a great measure conjectural, as medicine, agriculture,\n      and political economy. And he proposed that there should be kept, in\n      every branch of the administration, an exact register of the trials\n      made of different measures, and of the results, whether good or bad,\n      to which they have led. (See the Edinburgh Review, vol. xxiii. pp\n      335, 336.) Napoleon, who appointed him Minister of the Interior, has\n      thus described him: \u00e2\u0080\u009cA geometrician of the first class, he did not\n      reach mediocrity as a statesman. He never viewed any subject in its\n      true light; he was always occupied with subtleties; his notions were\n      all problematic; and he carried into the administration the spirit\n      of the _infinitely_ small.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See the Encyclopedia Britannica, art.\n      Laplace, vol. xiii. p. 101. Memoires Ecrits \u00c3\u00a0 Ste. Helena, i. 3. The\n      injurious effect of deductive reasoning, upon the minds of those who\n      addict themselves to this method alone, to the exclusion of all\n      other modes of arriving at the knowledge of truth in fact, is shown\n      with great clearness and success, by Mr. Whewel in the ninth of the\n      Bridgewater Treatises, book 3, ch. 6. The calculus of probabilities\n      has been applied by some writers, to judicial evidence; but its very\n      slight value as a test, is clearly shown in an able article on\n      Presumptive Evidence, in the Law Magazine, vol. i. pp. 28-32 (New\n      Series.)\n\n   60 See Mr. Norton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cDiscourse on the latest form of Infidelity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d p.\n      18.\n\n   61 The arguments on this subject are stated in a condensed form, by Mr.\n      Horne, in his Introduction to the Study of the Holy Scriptures, vol.\n      i. ch. 4, sec. 2; in which he refers, among others, to Doctor\n      Gregory\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Letters on the Evidences of the Christian Revelation; Dr.\n      Campbell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Dissertation on Miracles; Vince\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sermons on the\n      Credibility of Miracles; Bishop Marsh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Lectures, part 6, lect. 30;\n      Dr. Adam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Treatise in reply to Mr. Hume; Bishop Gleig\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      Dissertation on Miracles, (in the third volume of his edition of\n      Stackhouse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s History of the Bible, p. 240, &c.); Dr. Key\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Norissian\n      Lectures, vol. i.

There was commonly an interval of ten or twelve months,\n      between the making of the contract of marriage and the time of its\n      celebration. _Gen_. xxiv. 55; _Judg_. xiv. 8. During this period,\n      though there was no intercourse between the bride and bridegroom,\n      not even so much as an interchange of conversation, yet they were\n      considered and spoken of as husband and wife. If, at the end of this\n      probationary period, the bridegroom was unwilling to solemnize his\n      engagements by the marriage of the bride, he was bound to give her a\n      bill of divorce, as if she had been his wife. And if she, during the\n      same period, had illicit intercourse with another man, she was\n      liable to punishment, as an adulteress.

This decree was issued eleven years before\n      it was carried into effect, the delay having been procured by Herod.\n      This fact reconciles the evangelist with the Roman historians, from\n      whom it appears that Cyrenius was not governor when the decree was\n      issued, though he held that office when the census was taken and the\n      tax assessed.

According to Josephus, Herod was\n      always in fear for the stability of his throne, and anxious to pry\n      into futurity to discover whether it was likely to endure. Thus,\n      when advanced to regal power, he sent for Manahem, an Essene, who\n      had predicted of him when a boy that he would be a king, to inquire\n      of him how long he should reign.

The naked statement of this fact,\n      without explanation, is a mark of the sincerity of the evangelist,\n      for the value of which we are indebted to Josephus, who relates,\n      (Ant. b. 17, ch. 9, \u00c2\u00a7 3,) an instance of savage cruelty in\n      Archelaus, immediately on his coming to the throne, in causing three\n      thousand persons to be butchered in cold blood, at the first\n      passover after Herod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. Such an act, committed under such\n      circumstances, must have been rapidly made known abroad, and\n      inspired all persons with horror. Well, therefore, might Joseph fear\n      to return. But Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s incidental allusion to the cause, is\n      characteristic of a man intent only upon the statement of the main\n      facts, and regardless of appearances or explanations.

Jewish children were not obliged to\n      the observances of the ceremonial law, until they attained to years\n      of discretion, which, in males, was fixed by common consent at\n      twelve years. On arriving at this age, they were taken to Jerusalem\n      at the passover, of which they thenceforth participated, as \u00e2\u0080\u009csons of\n      commandment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d being fully initiated into the doctrines and\n      ceremonies of the Jewish church, probably after examination by the\n      doctors. This accounts for the circumstance of his being found among\n      them, both hearing, and asking them questions. STACKHOUSE, Hist. N.\n      T. ch. i.; BLOOMFIELD, _in loc_.\n\n  100 Luke ii. 44; _in the company_. All who came, not only from the same\n      city, but from the same canton or district, made one company. They\n      carried necessaries along with them, and tents for their lodging at\n      night. Such companies they now call _caravans_, and in several\n      places have houses fitted up for their reception, called\n      _caravanseries_. This account of their manner of travelling\n      furnishes a ready answer to the question, How could Joseph and Mary\n      make a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey, without discovering, before night, that Jesus\n      was not in the company? In the day-time, we may reasonably presume,\n      the travellers would mingle with different parties of their friends\n      and acquaintance; but in the evening, when they were about to\n      encamp, every one would join the family to which he belonged.\n      CAMPBELL, _in loc_.\n\n  101 The Genealogy of Jesus, as given by Luke, is here inverted for the\n      sake of more convenient comparison with that given by Matthew.\n\n      The apparent discrepancies in these accounts are reconciled by Dr.\n      Robinson, in the following manner:\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cI. In the genealogy given by Matthew, considered by itself, some\n      difficulties present themselves.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c1. There is some diversity among commentators in making out the\n      three divisions, each of fourteen generations, v. 17. It is,\n      however, obvious, that the first division begins with Abraham and\n      ends with David. But does the second begin with David, or with\n      Solomon? Assuredly with the former; because, just as the first\n      begins _apo Abraham_, so the second also is said to begin _apo\n      David_. The first extends _heos David_, and includes him; the second\n      extends to an epoch and not to a person; and therefore the persons\n      who are mentioned as coeval with this epoch are not reckoned before\n      it. After the epoch the enumeration begins again with Jechoniah, and\n      ends with Jesus. In this way the three divisions are made out thus:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n      1. Abraham.\n      2. Isaac.\n      3. Jacob.\n      4. Judah.\n      5. Phares.\n      6. Esrom.\n      7. Aram.\n      8. Aminadab.\n      9. Naasson.\n      10. Salmon.\n      11. Boaz.\n      12. Obed.\n      13. Jesse.\n      14. David.\n\n      1. David.\n      2. Solomon.\n      3. Roboam.\n      4. Abiah.\n      5. Asa.\n      6. Josaphat.\n      7. Joram.\n      8. Uzziah (Ozias).\n      9. Jotham.\n      10. Ahaz.\n      11. Hezekiah.\n      12. Manasseh.\n      13. Amon.\n      14. Josiah.\n\n      1. Jechoniah.\n      2. Salathiel.\n      3. Zorobabel.\n      4. Abiud.\n      5. Eliakim.\n      6. Azor.\n      7. Sadoc.\n      8. Achim.\n      9. Eliud.\n      10. Eleazar.\n      11. Matthan.\n      12. Jacob.\n      13. Joseph.\n      14. Jesus.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c2. Another difficulty arises from the fact, that between Joram and\n      Ozias, in v. 8, three names of Jewish kings are omitted, viz.\n      Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah; see 2 K. 8, 25 and Chr. 22, 1. 2 K. 11,\n      2. 21 and 2 Chr. 22, 11. 2 K. 12, 21. 14, 1 and 2 Chr. 24, 27.\n      Further, between Josiah and Jechoniah in v. 11, the name of\n      Jehoiakim is also omitted; 2 K. 23, 34. 2 Chr. 36, 4. comp. 1 Chr.\n      3, 15, 16. If these four names are to be reckoned, then the second\n      division, instead of fourteen generations, will contain eighteen, in\n      contradiction to v. 17. To avoid this difficulty, Newcome and some\n      others have regarded v. 17 as a mere gloss, \u00e2\u0080\u0098a marginal note taken\n      into the text.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 This indeed is in itself possible; yet all the\n      external testimony of manuscripts and versions is in favour of the\n      genuineness of that verse. It is better therefore to regard these\n      names as having been customarily omitted in the current genealogical\n      tables, from which Matthew copied. Such omissions of particular\n      generations did sometimes actually occur, \u00e2\u0080\u0098propteres quod mal\u00c3\u00a6\n      essent et impi\u00c3\u00a6,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 according to R. Sal. Jarchi; Lightfoot, Hor. Heb.\n      in Matth. 1, 8. A striking example of an omission of this kind,\n      apparently without any such reason, is found in Ezra 7, 1-5,\n      compared with 1 Chr. 6, 3-15. This latter passage contains the\n      lineal descent of the high-priests from Aaron to the captivity;\n      while Ezra, in the place cited, in tracing back his own genealogy\n      through the very same line of descent, omits at least six\n      generations. A similar omission is necessarily implied in the\n      genealogy of David, as given Ruth 4, 20-22. 1 Chr. 2, 10-12. Matth.\n      1, 5, 6. Salmon was contemporary with the capture of Jericho by\n      Joshua, and married Rahab. But from that time until David, an\n      interval of at least four hundred and fifty years (Acts 13, 20,)\n      there intervened, according to the list, only four generations,\n      averaging of course more than one hundred years to each. But the\n      highest average in point of fact is _three_ generations to a\n      century; and if reckoned by the eldest sons they are usually\n      shorter, or three generations for every seventy-five or eighty\n      years. See Sir I. Newton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chronol. p. 53. Lond. 1728.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe may therefore rest in the necessary conclusion, that as our\n      Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regular descent from David was always asserted, and was never\n      denied even by the Jews; so Matthew, in tracing this admitted\n      descent, appealed to genealogical tables, which were public and\n      acknowledged in the family and tribe from which Christ sprang. He\n      could not indeed do otherwise. How much stress was laid by the Jews\n      upon lineage in general, and how much care and attention were\n      bestowed upon such tables, is well known. See Lightfoot, Hor. Heb.\n      in Matth. 1, 1. Comp. Phil. 3, 4, 5.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cII. Other questions of some difficulty present themselves, when we\n      compare together the two genealogies.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c1. Both tables at first view purport to give the lineage of our\n      Lord through Joseph. But Joseph cannot have been the son by natural\n      descent of both Joseph and Heli (Eli), Matth. 1, 16. Luke 3, 23.\n      Only one of the tables therefore can give his true lineage by\n      generation. This is done apparently in that of Matthew; because,\n      beginning at Abraham, it proceeds by natural descent, as we know\n      from history, until after the exile; and then continues on in the\n      same mode of expression until Joseph. Here the phrase is changed;\n      and it is no longer Joseph who \u00e2\u0080\u0099begat\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Jesus, but Joseph \u00e2\u0080\u0098the\n      husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called the Christ.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n      See Augustine, de Consensu Evangel. II. 5.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c2. To whom then does the genealogy in Luke chiefly relate? If in\n      any way to Joseph, as the language purports, then it must be because\n      he in some way bore the legal relation of son to Heli, either by\n      adoption or by marriage. If the former simply, it is difficult to\n      comprehend why, along with his true personal lineage as traced by\n      Matthew up through the royal line of Jewish kings to David, there\n      should be given also another subordinate genealogy, not personally\n      his own, and running back through a different and inferior line to\n      the same great ancestor. If, on the other hand, as is most probable,\n      this relation to Heli came by marriage with his daughter, so that\n      Joseph was truly his _son-in-law_ (comp. Ruth 1, 8. 11. 12); then it\n      follows, that the genealogy in Luke is in fact that of Mary the\n      mother of Jesus. This being so, we can perceive a sufficient reason\n      why this genealogy should be thus given, viz. in order to show\n      definitely, that Jesus was in the most full and perfect sense a\n      descendant of David: not only by law in the royal line of kings,\n      through his reputed father, but also in fact by direct personal\n      descent through his mother.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat Mary, like Joseph, was a descendant of David, is not indeed\n      elsewhere expressly said in the New Testament. Yet a very strong\n      presumption to that effect is to be drawn from the address of the\n      angel in Luke 1, 32; as also from the language of Luke 2, 5, where\n      Joseph, as one of the posterity of David, is said to have gone up to\n      Bethlehem, to _enroll himself with Mary his espoused wife_. The\n      ground and circumstances of Mary\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enrolment must obviously have\n      been the same as in the case of Joseph himself. Whether all this\n      arose from her having been an only child and heiress, as some\n      suppose, so that she was espoused to Joseph in accordance with Num.\n      36, 8, 9, it is not necessary here to inquire. See Michaelis\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0098Commentaries on the Laws of Moses,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Part II. \u00c2\u00a7 78.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is indeed objected, that it was not customary among the Jews to\n      trace back descent through the female line, that is, on the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      side. There are, however, examples to show that this was sometimes\n      done; and in the case of Jesus, as we have seen, there was a\n      sufficient reason for it. Thus in 1 Chr. 2, 22, Jair is enumerated\n      among the posterity of Judah by regular descent. But the grandfather\n      of Jair had married the daughter of Machir, one of the heads of\n      Manasseh, 1 Chr. 2, 21. 7, 14; and therefore in Num. 32, 40. 41,\n      Jair is called the son (descendant) of Manasseh. In like manner, in\n      Ezra, 2, 61, and Neh. 7, 63, a certain family is spoken of as \u00e2\u0080\u0098the\n      children of Barzillai;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because their ancestor \u00e2\u0080\u0098took a wife of the\n      daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their\n      name.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009c3. A question is raised as to the identity, in the two genealogies,\n      of the Salathiel and Zorobabel named as father and son, Matth. 1,\n      12. Luke 3, 27. The Zorobabel of Matthew is no doubt the chief, who\n      led back the first band of captives from Babylon, and rebuilt the\n      temple, Ezra c. 2-6. He is also called the son of Salathiel in Ezra\n      3, 2. Neb. 12, 1. Hagg. 1, 1. 2, 2. 23. Were then the Salathiel and\n      Zorobabel of Luke the same persons? Those who assume this, must rest\n      solely on the identity of the names; for there is no other possible\n      evidence to prove, either that they were contemporary, or that they\n      were not different persons. On the other hand, there are one or two\n      considerations, of some force, which go to show that they were\n      probably not the same persons.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst, if Salathiel and Zorobabel are indeed the same in both\n      genealogies, then Salathiel who, according to Matthew, was the son\n      of Jechoniah by natural descent, must have been called the son of\n      Neri in Luke either from adoption or marriage. In that case, his\n      connection with David through Nathan, as given by Luke, was not his\n      own personal genealogy. It is difficult, therefore, to see Luke,\n      after tracing back the descent of Jesus to Salathiel, should abandon\n      the true personal lineage in the royal line of kings, and turn aside\n      again to a merely collateral and humbler line. If the mother of\n      Jesus was in fact descended from the Zorobabel and Salathiel of\n      Matthew, she, like them, was descended also from David through the\n      royal line. Why rob her of this dignity, and ascribe to her only a\n      descent through an inferior lineage? See Spanheim Dubia Evangel. I.\n      p. 108, sq.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cAgain, the mere identity of names under these circumstances,\n      affords no proof; for nothing is more common even among\n      contemporaries. Thus we have two Ezras; one in Neh. 12, 1. 13, 33;\n      from whom Ezra the scribe is expressly distinguished in v. 36. We\n      have likewise two Nehemiahs; one who went up with Zorobabel, Ezra 2,\n      2; and the other the governor who went later to Jerusalem, Neh. 2,\n      9, sq. So too, as contemporaries, Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel,\n      and Joram (Jehoram,) son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah; 2 K. 8, 16,\n      coll. v. 23, 24. Also Joash king of Judah, and Joash king of Israel;\n      2 K. 13, 9, 10. Further, we find in succession among the descendants\n      of Cain the following names: Enoch, Irad, Mehujael, Methusael,\n      Lamech, Gen. 4, 17, 18; and later among the descendants of Seth\n      these similar ones: Enoch, Methusalah, Lamech, Gen. 5, 21-25.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See\n      Dr. Robinson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Greek Harmony of the Gospels, pp. 183-187.\n\n  102 Mal. iii. 1; Is. xl. 3.\n\n  103 In the New Testament, the same word is used for _the high priests_,\n      and the chief priests, who were the heads of the twenty-four\n      courses. So that the two persons whom the Roman governor considered\n      as the chief of the priests, and whose names stood as such in those\n      public registers which seem here referred to, may be intended. An\n      irregularity had arisen out of the confusion of the times: and the\n      ruler or prince under the Romans, though a chief priest, was a\n      distinct person from the high priest: Annas being the one, and\n      Caiaphas the other.

NEWCOME.\n\n  110 John means that he was not really Elias risen from the dead. But\n      when Jesus says, (Matth. xvii. 12, and xi. 14,) that Elias was come\n      already, he means that John had appeared _in the spirit and power of\n      Elias_. Luke i. 17. Thus likewise, John here denies that he is one\n      of the ancient prophets again appearing on earth: see Luke ix 19;\n      with which our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assertion that he was an eminent prophet, Luke\n      vii. 28, seems perfectly consistent.

CAMPBELL, _in loc_.\n\n  120 The service of the synagogue consisted of reading the scriptures,\n      prayer, and preaching. The posture in which the latter was\n      performed, whether in the synagogue or elsewhere, (see _Matth_. v.\n      1; _Luke_ v. 3,) was sitting. Accordingly when our Saviour had read\n      the portion of scripture, in the synagogue at Nazareth, of which he\n      was a member, having been brought up in that city, and then, instead\n      of retiring to his place, _sat down_ in the desk or pulpit, it is\n      said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe eyes of all that were present were fastened upon him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n      because they perceived, by this posture, that he was about to preach\n      to them. See also Acts xiii. 14, 15. JENNINGS, Ant. 375.\n\n  121 1 Kings xvii. 1, 9.\n\n  122 2 Kings v. 14.\n\n  123 The accuracy of this description is attested by travellers, to this\n      day. See ROBINSON\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Travels in Palestine, vol. iii., pp. 186, 187.\n\n  124 Matthew says that the disciples were called by Christ while walking\n      by the sea, because that calling followed the walk by the sea. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\n      say that a thing was done by one walking in this or that place,\n      because he took such a walk, whether he who did the act was then\n      walking, or sitting or standing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spanb. dub. lxxii. v. 2. This\n      remark reconciles \u00e2\u0080\u009c_walking_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matth. iv. 18 with \u00e2\u0080\u009c_stood_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke v.\n      1. A like remark may be made with respect to the passages placed\n      parallel to Luke v. 6. Jesus is concisely represented as if he had\n      at first seen Peter and Andrew casting a net into the sea, because\n      they were employed thus in consequence of the interview.\n\n      Luke does not deny that more than Simon were seen, nor does he\n      affirm that Simon was seen. Indeed our Lord is said to have seen two\n      ships by the lake. The calling of others beside Simon not only is\n      not denied by Luke, but is sufficiently indicated in v. 11. The\n      words of Matthew (v. 21) \u00e2\u0080\u009cgoing on from thence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d are not to be\n      understood as implying a great distance, but as relating to the\n      neighbouring shore. Matthew relates the principal fact, the calling\n      and the following; Luke has the accompanying circumstances. And\n      there is a remarkable harmony between them. Matthew records the\n      repairing of their nets by the fishermen; Luke shows how they became\n      broken,\u00e2\u0080\u0094by the great draught they had taken. What is related by\n      Luke, is not denied by Matthew, but omitted only. Nothing, indeed,\n      is more common than to find the omission of some supplied by the\n      other Evangelists. NEWCOME.\n\n  125 The death of Zebedee is nowhere mentioned in the gospels; yet an\n      undesigned coincidence, and proof of the veracity of the\n      Evangelists, is evident by comparing this place with others, in\n      which his death is tacitly alluded to. Thus, in Chap. viii. 21, it\n      is related that \u00e2\u0080\u009canother of his _disciples_ said unto him, Lord,\n      suffer me first to go and _bury my father_;\u00e2\u0080\u009d and in Chap. xx. 20, it\n      is said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen came to him the _mother of Zebedee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s children_ with\n      her sons, worshipping him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d &c.

The word translated _torn_, signifies to move, agitate,\n      convulse. It occurs only twice in the Septuagint. In 2. Sam. xxii.\n      8, the Hebrew signifies to be shaken, _ut in terr\u00c3\u00a6 motu_. In Jer.\n      iv. 19, it is applied to commotion of mind.

NEWCOME. For the consequences of a premature full\n      manifestation of himself as the Messiah, by awakening the jealousy\n      of the Roman government, might, humanly speaking, have impeded his\n      ministry. Yet there was great propriety in the private exhibition,\n      to the priesthood, of full proof that he was the Messiah; after\n      which, their obstinacy in rejecting him was inexcusable. In this,\n      and divers other instances, our Lord manifested his intent not to be\n      generally known to the Jews as their Messiah, till the consummation\n      of his ministry. A general announcement of his divine character at\n      the outset would have been productive of no good; on the contrary it\n      would have excited the malice of the Scribes, Pharisees and\n      Herodians against him; would have favoured the conceit of the Jews\n      that he was to be their temporal king; would have awakened the\n      jealousy of the Roman government; and in the natural course of\n      things, would have prevented him from giving the many miraculous\n      proofs which he gave of his ministry, and thus laying solid\n      foundations for faith in his divine mission; would have exposed him\n      and his religion to the charge of ostentation, vanity, and love of\n      power and display; and would have deprived the world of that example\n      which he gave, of meekness, humility and patient suffering and\n      self-denial. According to human experience, an early assumption of\n      regal splendour, supported by the miracles he wrought, would have\n      been successful, and carried him to the throne instead of the cross;\n      but it would have deprived the world of the great object of his\n      mission. A sufficient number were enlightened to attest his miracles\n      and proclaim his religion, and enough were left in their ignorance,\n      to condemn and crucify him. See A. CLARKE, and SCOTT, _in loc_.\n\n  130 Lev. xiv. 2, seq.\n\n  131 When a Jew became a Roman citizen, he usually assumed a Roman name.\n      It is therefore supposed that Levi was the original Hebrew, and\n      Matthew the assumed Roman name of this evangelist.

Not one of these, the prophet seems to\n      intimate, should go away without redress; he will certainly remove\n      the cause of their complaints, and render truth and justice\n      victorious over falsehood and oppression. 3 CALM. 394.\n\n  142 It appears from Mark vi. 7, that the apostles were sent forth by\n      _two and two_ to preach; and this accounts for their being here and\n      in the parallel places named in couples. Luke mentions Matthew\n      first, as being regarded as the senior of Thomas, his companion; but\n      Matthew modestly places his own name last. Mark is less observant of\n      the order of the names, but he alone states that they were thus\n      associated. The others give the names in couples, but state no\n      reason for it. This is not the method of false witnesses; such\n      incidental corroborations belong only to the narratives of truth.\n\n  143 Thaddeus, Theudas and Judas (or Jude) are probably names of the same\n      signification, the Greek termination being added to different forms\n      of a Hebrew verb. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Canaanite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Matth. x. 4, is the same with\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cZelotes\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Luke. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCognomen erat Chald. quod Lucas reddidit\n      Zelotem.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Wetstein. Thus, Thomas is rendered Didymus, or, the twin;\n      Cephas, Peter; and Silas, Tertius. Some suppose that this name had\n      been given to Simon on account of his religious zeal; or, because he\n      had been of a Jewish sect called Zealots, who were addicted to the\n      Pharisees, and justified themselves by the example of Phinehas, for\n      punishing offenders without waiting for the sentence of the\n      magistrate. NEWCOME.\n\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween Matthew (x. 2,) and Mark (iii. 16,) we observe a strict\n      correspondence, but the catalogue in St. Luke (vi. 14,) differs from\n      both the first-mentioned writers, in two particulars. 1, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Simon the\n      Canaanite,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Matthew and Mark is introduced as \u00e2\u0080\u0098Simon called\n      Zelotes.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Now if any difference was admitted in this place, we might\n      expect it to extend no farther than to the order of the names, or\n      the addition of a surname; as, for instance, Matthew calls the\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0098Thaddeus\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Mark also \u00e2\u0080\u0098Lebbeus;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but here we have one surname\n      changed for another. It is indeed easy to conceive, that Simon might\n      have been commonly distinguished by either appellative, but this we\n      can only conjecture; neither Evangelist adds a word to explain the\n      point. 2, The other discrepancy, however, appears more serious. The\n      Lebbeus or Thaddeus of St. Matthew and Mark, is entirely omitted in\n      the list of St. Luke, who substitutes \u00e2\u0080\u0098Judas the brother of James.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n      Here is certainly a marked difference, for it would not seem very\n      probable, that the Apostle in question passed by three distinct\n      names. Nor could this be a mere oversight in St. Luke, for, in Acts\n      i. 13, where a catalogue of the eleven is inserted, he mentioned\n      this individual in exactly the same manner. Are we to suppose then\n      that the Evangelist commits a deliberate error in this particular?\n      We have distinct and satisfactory witnesses to prove that there\n      really was an Apostle, besides Iscariot, who bore the name of Judas.\n      Both Matthew (xiii. 55,) and Mark (vi. 3,) concur in speaking of\n      James and Jude as the near relations of Christ, and part of this\n      statement is incidentally confirmed by St. Paul, who calls James\n      \u00e2\u0080\u0098the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 (Gal. i. 19.) But farther, St. John (xiv. 22,)\n      presents us with a remark made by \u00e2\u0080\u0098Judas not Iscariot;\u00e2\u0080\u0099 evidently\n      one of the Apostles; and St. Jude himself, in the first verse of his\n      Epistle, styles himself \u00e2\u0080\u0098the brother of James.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 There is thus amply\n      sufficient evidence, that all the Gospel writers acknowledge an\n      Apostle of this name, though St. Matthew, with his usual simplicity,\n      familiarly mentions him by two of his appellations, omitting that of\n      Judas, and St. Mark sees no occasion to depart from his language, in\n      a matter of such general notoriety. Luke, on the other hand, usually\n      studious of accuracy, distinguishes this Apostle by the name\n      generally current in the Church, when his Gospel was written. This\n      variation then may, upon the whole, convince us how undesignedly the\n      writers of Scripture confirm each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statements; yet can this\n      only be the result of a minute examination upon our part, and upon\n      the probability of this, a cautious writer would hardly stake his\n      reputation for truth or exactness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See ROBERTS\u00e2\u0080\u0099S \u00e2\u0080\u009cLight shining out\n      of Darkness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pp. 91-93.\n\n  144 It may be objected that Matthew, in saying that this discourse was\n      delivered sitting on a mountain, is contradicted by Luke, who says,\n      that Jesus was standing on a plain. Luke vi. 17. But Dr. Clarke, on\n      this latter place, has suggested that Jesus \u00e2\u0080\u009cbeing pressed with\n      great multitudes of people, might retire from them again to the top\n      of the hill.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Dr. Priestley observes that \u00e2\u0080\u009cMatthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s saying that\n      Jesus was _sat down_ after he had gone up the mountain, and Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      saying that he stood on the plain, when he healed the sick before\n      the discourse, are no inconsistencies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harm. p. 83.\n\n      The whole picture is striking. Jesus ascends a mountain, employs the\n      night in prayer, and having thus solemnly invoked the divine\n      blessing, authoritatively separates the twelve apostles from the\n      mass of his disciples. He descends, and heals, in the plain, all\n      among a great multitude, collected from various parts by the fame of\n      his miraculous power. Having thus created attention, he satisfies\n      the desire of the people to hear his doctrine; and retiring first to\n      the mountain whence he came, that his attentive hearers might follow\n      him, and might better arrange themselves before him. Sacro digna\n      silentio Mirantur _omnes_ dicere. _Hor_. NEWCOME.\n\n      The different accounts of the Sermon on the Mount may be reconciled,\n      by considering that Mathew wrote chiefly for the Hebrew Christians;\n      and it was therefore important for him to bring out, in full, the\n      manner in which our Lord enforced the spiritual nature of his\n      dispensation and doctrine, in opposition to the mere letter of the\n      Jewish law, and the teaching and practice of Scribes and Pharisees;\n      which he does particularly and with many examples; while Luke, on\n      the contrary, wrote chiefly for Gentile Christians, to whom the\n      contrast with the Jewish law was of less interest; and therefore he\n      omits those parts of the discourse, and dwells only upon those which\n      were of practical importance to all. ROBINSON. NEWCOME.\n\n  145 The Greek word here employed is said to be derived from the\n      Persians, among whom the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s messengers or posts were called\n      _Angari_. These had the royal authority for pressing horses, ships,\n      and even men, to assist them in the business on which they were\n      sent. The word therefore signifies, to be compelled by violence to\n      do any particular service, especially of the public kind, by the\n      king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority. And the sentiment is a lesson of patience and\n      gentleness under severe exactions from man. _Lightfoot, apud_ A.\n      CLARKE, _in loc_. SIR J. CHARDIN\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Travels, Vol. i. p. 238, 257.\n\n  146 Calvin says that Matthew, being more brief, introduces the centurion\n      himself as speaking; and that Luke expresses more at large his\n      sending by his friends; but that the sense of both is the same.\n      _Harm_. p. 124.\n\n      (Toinard quotes Exod. xviii. 6, where the words related as spoken by\n      Jethro, were evidently a message sent by him to Moses. _Harm_. 147.)\n      Considering then the sameness of the scene, of the person, of the\n      words, and of the transaction, I cannot but conclude with Grotius,\n      that the miracle is one and the same, related in general by Matthew,\n      and with greater accuracy by Luke. NEWCOME.\n\n  147 The nature of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ministry, as it now appeared, so unlike\n      what John as a Jew expected, may have surprised and perplexed him.\n      And his own misfortune, coming upon this disappointment and\n      perplexity, would increase his doubt and embarrassment. His faith\n      was shaken;\u00e2\u0080\u0094the question implies no more;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he sent that his\n      doubts might be removed, and his faith confirmed. Jesus therefore\n      merely referred John to the miracles he was doing, and the\n      prophecies which spake of him, and which were fulfilled by those\n      miracles. Bp. SUMNER, in loc.\n\n  148 Is. xxxv. 5, seq.\n\n  149 Mal. iii. 1.\n\n  150 Mal. iv. 5.\n\n  151 We here learn that the demoniac was both blind and dumb. St. Luke\n      omits the former circumstance, but does not contradict it. NEWCOME.\n\n  152 An accurate reader will observe that Matt. xii. 22, and Luke xi. 14,\n      show the general occasion of the blasphemy against Jesus; and that\n      Matt. xii. 23, shews the particular occasion of it, the multitude\n      alarming the Jewish rulers by their question whether Jesus were the\n      Christ. No cause for the absurd and impious insinuation of the\n      Scribes and Pharisees is assigned by St. Mark: however, he suggests\n      an important circumstance, that they came from Jerusalem to watch\n      the conduct of Jesus. The latter part of Luke viii. 19, shows that\n      his relations were not able to enter the house on account of the\n      press. Thus one Evangelist is wonderfully supplemental to another by\n      notations of time, place, and other circumstances; and the strictest\n      propriety and agreement result from diligently comparing them.\n      NEWCOME.\n\n  153 The writer of a false narrative would either have omitted to mention\n      the request for a sign, or would have related that it was complied\n      with. He would never have exposed his Master to the suspicion of a\n      want of power. See also, Matt. xvi. 1.\n\n  154 Jonah i. 17.\n\n  155 Jonah iii. 4, 5.\n\n  156 1 Kings x. 1 seq.\n\n  157 This omission may seem inconsistent with the character of Jesus, who\n      appears to have generally complied with all the innocent usages of\n      his countrymen; and of course it may be adduced as an objection\n      against the veracity of the Evangelist. Luke simply records the\n      fact, however it may seem to make against the character of his\n      Master, or his own veracity. But Mark, vii. 3-9, in a manner equally\n      incidental and without design, discloses the truth that this washing\n      was superstitious, and connected with the dangerous error of placing\n      the traditions of the elders on equal footing with the commands of\n      God. Where there was danger of his practice being misinterpreted,\n      our Lord withheld his compliance, even in things indifferent. See\n      Bp.

The\n      incidental allusion here made to that fact, would hardly have been\n      made by a writer of fiction.\n\n  160 Is. vi. 9, 10.\n\n  161 Ps. lxxviii. 2.\n\n  162 This is made consistent with the other Evangelists, by reading\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cGadarenes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If Gergasa was subordinate to Gadara, the metropolis of\n      Perea, as Cellarius and Reland judge, and St. Mark did not write in\n      Judea, what wonder that he chose the more general name, which was\n      best known in the world?  But Cellarius from Eusebius takes notice\n      that some esteemed Gergasi, so Eusebius writes it, and Gadara two\n      names of the same city; and this he thinks was the sentiment of the\n      Syriac translator. To this Sir Richard Ellis most inclines, in his\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cFortuita Sacra.\u00e2\u0080\u009d TOWNSON, p. 72.\n\n      In Matthew mention is made of two demoniacs; in Mark and Luke of one\n      only. Here Le Clerc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maxim is undoubtedly true: Qui plura narrat,\n      pauciora complectitur: qui pauciora memorat, plura non negat.\n      _Harm_. p. 524.\n\n      We may collect a reason from the Gospels themselves, why Mark and\n      Luke mention only one demoniac; because, one only being grateful for\n      the miracle, his cure only was recorded by the two Evangelists, who\n      mention this gratitude, and who are more intent on inculcating the\n      moral, than on magnifying our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power. NEWCOME.\n\n  163 There is no contradiction here between Matth. and Mark. The\n      demoniacs met Jesus on the shore, as he came out of the ship. Luke\n      viii. 27. The swine were within sight, on the ascending ground, Luke\n      viii. 32, at the side of the mountain, Mark v. 11, which was at some\n      distance from the shore where they stood. Matth. viii. 30.\n\n  164 Since swine were held in abhorrence by the Jews, how happened a herd\n      of them to be feeding by the sea of Tiberias? The answer shows the\n      accuracy of the Evangelist and his intimate knowledge of the local\n      circumstances of Judea; for it appears from Josephus, Antiq. xvii.\n      11, 4, that _Gadara_ was a _Grecian city_, the inhabitants of which,\n      therefore, were not Jews. BLUNT, Veracity, &c. sect. ii. 6.\n\n  165 Here is a reference to an Eastern custom, which affords internal\n      evidence of the truth of the narrative. The master sat on a higher\n      seat, and the scholars sat at his feet. Sitting at the feet, was the\n      posture of a learner; and indicated the reverence and submission due\n      to the teacher. Thus Moses says of the people, to whom God gave the\n      law from Mount Sinai,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cthey sat down at thy feet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Deut. xxxiii. 3.\n      Isaiah, speaking of Abraham, who was taught of God, says \u00e2\u0080\u009che called\n      him to his foot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Is. xli. 2. Mary \u00e2\u0080\u009csat at Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet and heard\n      his words.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Luke x. 39. Paul was brought up \u00e2\u0080\u009cat the feet of\n      Gamaliel;\u00e2\u0080\u009d Acts xxii. 3; studied law with him. And the restored\n      maniac sat down at Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feet, in the posture of a humble learner,\n      desiring no other wisdom than to be taught of him.\n\n  166 Both Mark and Luke state that this was in Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own house; and\n      Luke calls it a great feast, made in honour of Jesus. The omission\n      of this fact by Matthew, not only shows his modesty and humility,\n      but adds much to the weight of evidence in his favour, both as a\n      man, and as a witness.  See BLUNT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Veracity of the Gospels, sect.\n      i. 4.\n\n  167 Hos. vi. 6; 1 Sam. xv. 22.\n\n  168 Neither of the Evangelists expressly mentions the death of Joseph;\n      yet from all four of them it may indirectly be inferred to have\n      happened while Jesus was yet alive. Comp. Luke viii. 19, John ii.\n      12, and xix. 25-27. Such harmony as this could not have been the\n      effect of concert. See BLUNT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Veracity, &c. sect. i. 7.\n\n  169 Commentators have noted two inconsistent circumstances in this\n      section. In Matthew, _shoes are_ forbidden; in Mark the Apostles are\n      commanded to be shod with _sandals_. But the true solution seems to\n      be this, that the Apostles should not furnish themselves with spare\n      garments, and should wear the simplest covering for their feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNon\n      vult ullis rebus studiose comparatis onerari.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Beza.

JENNINGS, Ant. p. 376. Such an allusion as this would not be\n      likely to have been found in a work of fiction.\n\n  171 Mic. vii. 6.\n\n  172 Matth. xiv. 2, _unto his servants_. Matthew alone mentions, and\n      without any apparent reason for such minuteness, that Herod\n      addressed his remark to his _servants_ it. Luke, in the parallel\n      passage, says he _heard of all that was done by him_; but by\n      referring to Luke viii. 3, and to Acts xiii. 1, we find that Christ\n      had followers from among the household of the very prince, with whom\n      Herod was likely to converse on a subject in which they were better\n      informed than himself. BLUNT, Veracity, &c., sec. i. 8.\n\n  173 Here is a very natural passing allusion to what we learn from\n      Josephus was a settled custom in the family of Herod; namely, the\n      making of a feast on his birth-day, at which the officers of his\n      government were guests. JOSEPHUS, Ant. xix. vii. \u00c2\u00a7 1.\n\n  174 Mark incidentally mentions the great multitude coming and going, and\n      the purpose of Jesus to withdraw _awhile_. The occasion of this\n      great multitude of _travellers_ is stated in the like incidental\n      manner by John, vi. 4, that the _passover_ was nigh at hand; and\n      hence, if Jesus withdrew awhile, the throng would be drawn off\n      towards Jerusalem. These undesigned coincidences tend to verify both\n      the narratives. Blunt, Veracity, &c. sect. i. 13.\n\n  175 Why Jesus addressed this question to Philip, and why John mentioned\n      so unimportant a fact, is not here explained. Nor does Luke indicate\n      any reason for his own statement of the place where this miracle was\n      wrought, namely, near Bethsaida. But John, in another place, (ch. i.\n      44,) with apparently as little reason, gratuitously states that\n      Philip was of Bethsaida; and this fact renders both the others\n      intelligible and significant. Jesus, intending to furnish bread for\n      the multitude by a miracle, first asked Philip, who belonged to the\n      city and was perfectly acquainted with the neighbourhood, whether\n      bread could be procured there. His answer amounts to saying that it\n      was not possible. These slight circumstances, thus collected\n      together, constitute very cogent evidence of the veracity of the\n      narrative, and evince the reality of the miracle itself. See Blunt,\n      Veracity, &c. sect. i. 13.\n\n  176 In Luke, Jesus commands that the people should be made to sit down\n      by _fifties_. In Mark it is said that they sat down _by hundreds and\n      by fifties_. Piscator, and Pearce, in a dissertation at the end of\n      his comment on St. Paul\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Epistles, say that they sat an hundred in\n      front, and fifty deep; which very satisfactorily solves the seeming\n      variation. NEWCOME.\n\n  177 This seemingly idle inquiry becomes important as a note of veracity\n      in the narrator, when compared with the account of Matthew. John\n      indeed tells us, v. 18, that the wind blew a gale, but he does not\n      state from what quarter. He also says that there were boats from\n      Tiberias, near the place where the miracle of bread was wrought, v.\n      23, but this does not at all explain the inquiry of the people how\n      Jesus came to Capernaum. But Matthew states that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe wind was\n      contrary,\u00e2\u0080\u009d that is, west, Matth. xiv. 22. This fact, and the\n      geographical position of the places, explains the whole. The miracle\n      was wrought near Bethsaida, on the east side of the lake. The people\n      saw the disciples take the only boat which was there, and depart for\n      Capernaum, which was on the west side of the lake, and saw that\n      Jesus was not with them. In the night it blew a tempest from the\n      west. In the morning, the storm being over, the people crossed over\n      to Capernaum and found Jesus already there. Well might they ask him,\n      with astonishment, how he came thither. For though there were boats\n      over from Tiberias, which was also on the west side of the lake, yet\n      he could not have returned in one of them, for the wind would not\n      have permitted them to cross the lake.

It showed that Jesus was willing to throw open his most\n      secret actions, discourses, and views not merely to his devoted\n      friends, but to a sagacious and hardened enemy. If Judas had ever\n      discovered the least fault in the character or conduct of Jesus, he\n      certainly would have disclosed it;\u00e2\u0080\u0094he would not have publicly\n      confessed that he had betrayed innocent blood, and have sunk down in\n      insupportable anguish and despair. See TAPPIN\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Lect. on Eccl. Hist.\n      ii.\n\n  183 The traditions of the elders were unwritten ordinances of indefinite\n      antiquity, the principal of which, as the Pharisees alleged, were\n      delivered to Moses in the mount, and all of which were transmitted\n      through the High Priests and Prophets, down to the members of the\n      great Sanhedrim in their own times; and from these, as the Jews say,\n      they were handed down to Gamaliel, and ultimately to Rabbi Jehudah,\n      by whom they were digested and committed to writing, toward the\n      close of the second century. This collection is termed the Mishna;\n      and in many cases it is esteemed among the Jews as of higher\n      authority than the law itself. In like manner, there are said to be\n      many Christians, at the present day, who receive ancient\n      traditionary usages and opinions as authoritative exponents of\n      Christian doctrine. They say that the preached gospel was before the\n      written gospel; and that the testimony of those who heard it is\n      entitled to equal credit with the written evidence of the\n      Evangelists; especially as the latter is but a brief record, while\n      the oral preaching was a more full and copious announcement of the\n      glad tidings.\n\n      These traditions, both of the Jewish and the Christian Church, seem\n      to stand _in pari ratione_, the arguments in favour of the\n      admissibility and effect of the one, applying with the same force,\n      in favour of the other. All these arguments may be resolved into two\n      grounds, namely, contemporaneous practice subsequently and uniformly\n      continued; and contemporaneous declarations, as part of the _res\n      gest\u00c3\u00a6_, faithfully transmitted to succeeding times. It is alleged\n      that those to whom the law of God was first announced, best knew its\n      precise import and meaning, and that therefore their interpretation\n      and practice, coming down concurrently with the law itself, is\n      equally obligatory.\n\n      But this argument assumes what cannot be admitted; for it still\n      remains to be shown that those who first heard the law, when orally\n      announced, had any better means of understanding it than those to\n      whom the same words were afterwards read. The Ten Commandments were\n      spoken in the hearing of Aaron and all the congregation of Israel;\n      immediately after which they made and worshipped a golden calf.\n      Surely this will not be adduced as a valid contemporaneous\n      exposition of the second commandment. The error of the argument lies\n      in the nature of the subject. The human doctrine of contemporaneous\n      exposition is applicable only to human laws and the transactions of\n      men, as equals, and not to the laws of God. Among men, when _their\n      own_ language is doubtful and ambiguous, _their own_ practice is\n      admissible, to expound it; because both the language and the\n      practice are but the outward and visible signs of the meaning and\n      intention of one and the same mind and will, which inward meaning\n      and intention is the thing sought after. It is on the same ground,\n      that, where a statute, capable of divers interpretations, has\n      uniformly been acted upon in a certain way, this is held a\n      sufficient exposition of its true intent. In both cases it is the\n      conduct of _the parties_ themselves which is admitted to interpret\n      their own language; expressed, in cases of contract, by themselves\n      in person, and in statutes, through the medium of the legislators,\n      who were their agents and representatives; and in both cases, it is\n      merely the interpretation of what a man says, by what he does. But\n      this rule has never been applied, in the law, to the language of any\n      other person than the party himself; never, to the command or\n      direction of his superior or employer. And even the language of the\n      _parties_, when it is contained in a sealed instrument, is at this\n      day held incapable of being expounded by their actions, on account\n      of the greater solemnity of the instrument. See Baynham _v_. Guy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      Hospital, 3 Vesey\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Rep. 295. Eaton _v_. Lyon, Ibid. 690, 694. The\n      practice of men, therefore, can be no just exponent of the law of\n      God. If they have mistaken the meaning of his command from the\n      beginning, the act of contravention remains a sin in the last\n      transgressor, as well as the first; for the word of God cannot be\n      changed or affected by the gloss of human interpretation.\n\n      The other ground, namely, that the testimony of those who heard\n      Jesus and his apostles preach, is of equal authority with the\n      Scriptures, being contemporaneous declarations, and parts of the\n      _res gestae_, and therefore admissible in aid of the exposition of\n      the written word, is equally inconsistent with the sound and settled\n      rules of law respecting writings. When a party has deliberately\n      committed his intention and meaning to writing, the law regards the\n      writing as the sole repository of his mind and intention, and does\n      not admit any oral testimony to alter, add to, or otherwise affect\n      it. The reasons for this rule are two; first, because the writing is\n      the more solemn act, by the party himself, designed to prevent\n      mistake, and to remain as the perpetual memorial of his intention;\n      and, secondly, because of the great uncertainty and weakness of any\n      secondary evidence. For no one can tell whether the by-standers\n      heard precisely what was said, nor whether they heard it all, nor\n      whether they continued to remember it with accuracy until the time\n      when they wrote it down, or communicated it to those who wrote it;\n      to say nothing of the danger of their mixing up the language of the\n      speaker with what was said by others, or with their own favourite\n      theories. And where the witnesses were not the original auditors of\n      what was said, no one knows how much the truth may have suffered\n      from the many channels through which it has passed, in coming from\n      the first speaker to the last write or witness. On all these\n      accounts, the law rejects oral testimony of what the parties said,\n      in regard to anything that has already been solemnly committed to\n      writing by the parties themselves, and rejects the secondary\n      evidence of hearsay, when evidence of a higher degree, as, for\n      example, a written declaration of the party, can be obtained.\n\n      Now, inasmuch as the writings of the Evangelists and Apostles were\n      penned under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, why should not the\n      documentary evidence of the Gospel, thus drawn up by them, be\n      treated with at least as much respect as other written documents? If\n      they were inspired to write down those great truths for a perpetual\n      memorial to after ages, then this record is the primary evidence of\n      those truths. It is the word of God, penned by his own dictation,\n      and sealed, as it were, with his own seal. If it were a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word\n      and will, thus solemnly written, no verbal or secondary evidence\n      could be admitted, by the common law, to explain, add to, or vary\n      it; nothing could be engrafted upon it; nor could any person be\n      admitted to testify what he heard the party say, in regard to what\n      was written. The courts would at once reject all such attempts, and\n      confine themselves strictly to the writing before them, the only\n      inquiry being as to the meaning of the language contained in that\n      document, and not as to what the party may elsewhere have spoken.\n      The law presumes that the writing alone is the source to which he\n      intended that resort should be had, in order to ascertain his\n      meaning. But by calling in the fathers, with their traditions, to\n      prove what Christ and his Apostles taught, beyond what is solemnly\n      recorded in the Scriptures, the principle of this plain and sound\n      rule of law is violated; resort is had to secondary evidence of the\n      truths of our religion, when the primary evidence is already at\n      hand; and the pure fountain is deserted for the muddy stream.\n\n  184 Matthew was not only a Jew himself, but it is evident, from the\n      whole structure of his Gospel, especially from his numerous\n      references to the Old Testament, that he wrote for Jewish\n      readers.\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Paley_. But the explanation here given by Mark is an\n      additional evidence of the fact asserted by Jerome and Clement of\n      Alexandria, that he wrote at Rome, for the benefit chiefly of the\n      converts of that nation.\n\n  185 Ex. xxii 12. Ex. xxi. 17. Deut. v. 16.\n\n  186 Is. xxix. 13.\n\n  187 Mark designates the woman by the country where she dwelt; Matthew\n      calls her a woman of Canaan, because of the people to whom she\n      belonged. Thus they do not contradict each other. The treatment of\n      this woman by our Lord has been the subject of remark, as evasive\n      and insincere. But it was far otherwise. He had a twofold object; to\n      call the attention of his disciples to the fact of her being a\n      foreigner, in order to show them that his ministry, though primarily\n      and chiefly to the Jews, was in truth designed for the benefit of\n      the Gentiles also; and to draw out, as it were, the great faith of\n      the woman, in order to teach them the effect of faithful and\n      persevering supplication. To attain these objects, he took the\n      direct and most obvious method. In this instance also, as in those\n      of the centurion, (Matth. viii. 5-13,) and of the Samaritan leper,\n      (Luke xvii. 16-18,) he indicated that the gospel would be more\n      readily received by the Gentiles than by the Jews. See A. CLARKE,\n      _in loc_. NEWCOME, Obs. on our Lord. p. 165. Bp. Horsley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Sermons\n      on this subject, Serm. xxxvii. and xxxviii. p. 444-464.\n\n  188 Cellarius and Lightfoot think that Dalmanutha and Magdala were\n      neighbouring towns. See Calmet, voc. Dalmanutha. It is probable that\n      Dalmanutha and Magdala were in Gaulanitis, towards the south-east\n      part of the lake. See Matth. xv. 21; Mark vii. 24. NEWCOME.\n\n  189 Our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, Matth. xvi. 8, 10, and Mark viii. 17, 20, are the\n      same in substance, though differently modified. The evangelists are\n      not scrupulous in adhering to the precise words used by Christ. They\n      often record them in a general manner, non numerantes, sed tanquem\n      appendentes; regarding their purport, and not superstitiously\n      detailing them. However, in this place, after uttering what Matthew\n      relates, Jesus may have asked the questions recorded by Mark.\n      NEWCOME.\n\n  190 The notice of this circumstance affords a proof of the veracity of\n      the evangelist; for he barely states a fact having no apparent\n      connexion with any other in his narrative. The reason of it is found\n      in facts stated by the other evangelists. The people of Bethsaida\n      had already witnessed the miracles of our Lord, but these only\n      served to increase their rage against him; and they were therefore\n      abandoned to the consequences of their of their unbelief. Matth. xi.\n      21.\n\n  191 The phrase _three days and three nights_ is equivalent to _three\n      days_, three natural days of twenty-four hours. Gen. i. 5; Dan.\n      viii. 14. Comp. Gen. vii. 4. 17.\n\n      (It is a received rule among the Jews, _that a part of a day is put\n      for the whole_; so that whatsoever is done in any part of the day,\n      is properly said to be done that day. 1 Kings xx. 29; Esth. iv. 16.\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen eight days were accomplished for the circumcision of the\n      child,\u00e2\u0080\u009d &c.

Grotius establishes this way of reckoning the _parts_ of the\n      first and third days for _two days_, by Aben Ezra on Lev. xii. 3.\n\n      (In proof that the phrase \u00e2\u0080\u009c_after three days,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d is sometimes\n      equivalent to \u00e2\u0080\u009c_on the third day,_\u00e2\u0080\u009d compare Deut. xiv. 28 with xxvi.\n      12; 1 Sam. xx. 12 with v. 19; 2 Chron. x. 5 with v. 12; Matth. xxvi.\n      2 with xxvii. 63, 64; Luke ii. 21 with i. 59.)\n\n      St. Luke omits our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sharp reproof of Peter, and the occasion\n      of it; though he records the discourse in consequence of it. Le\n      Clerc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 12th canon is \u00e2\u0080\u009cQui pauciora habet, non negat plura dicta aut\n      facta; modo ne ulla sit exclusionis nota.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Perhaps the disciple and\n      companion of that apostle who had withstood Peter to his face, Gal.\n      ii. 11, willingly made this omission, as he omits some aggravating\n      circumstances in Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denial of Christ, Luke xxii. 60, though he\n      carefully records the greatness of his sorrow, v. 62. NEWCOME.\n\n  192 It has been shown, \u00c2\u00a7 74, that \u00e2\u0080\u009c_after six days_\u00e2\u0080\u009d may signify on the\n      sixth day. But we are not hence to conclude that the phrase has\n      _always_ such a signification. Here it means six days complete,\n      after the discourse recorded in \u00c2\u00a7 74. The eight days mentioned by\n      St. Luke include that of Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproof and of the transfiguration;\n      which two days Matthew and Mark exclude. Macknight furnishes us with\n      the following apposite reference to Tacitus: Hist. i. 29. Piso says,\n      _Sextus dies agitur\u00e2\u0080\u0094ex quo\u00e2\u0080\u0094C\u00c3\u00a6sar adscitus sum;_ and yet, \u00c2\u00a7 48 of the\n      same book, Tacitus speaks of Piso as _quatriduo C\u00c3\u00a6sar_.\n\n      Grotius on Matth. xvii. 1, has another solution; Quod Lucas dicit,\n      tale est quale cum vulg\u00c3\u00b2 dicimus _post septimanam circiter. Nam\n      Jud\u00c3\u00a6os octo dies_ appellasse id quod ab uno sabbato est ad alterum\n      apparet, Joan. 20, 26, &c. NEWCOME.\n\n  193 It is remarkable that Luke assigns no reason for this extraordinary\n      silence; leaving his narrative in this place imperfect and obscure,\n      which an impostor would not have done. It is explained by the\n      command of Jesus, related by Matthew and Mark.\n\n  194 The original word is _didrachma_, denoting, not tribute or tax in\n      general, but a specific and particular offering which every Jew paid\n      to God. See Josephus, Ant. xviii. x. \u00c2\u00a7 1. This minute accuracy of\n      the evangelist is worthy of note, as an indication of veracity.\n\n  195 The twelve apostles and the seventy disciples were commissioned and\n      sent forth at different times. Hence the person here alluded to may,\n      for aught that appears, have been one of the seventy, not personally\n      known to John and to those who were with him. _Letters on Evil\n      Spirits_, p. 39.\n\n  196 Here Jesus says, He that is not against us is for us; but in Matth.\n      xii. 30, he says, He that is not with me is against me. Grotius\n      regards both as proverbial sayings;\u00e2\u0080\u0094Proverbia in utramque partem\n      usurpata, veritatem suam habent pro materia cui aptantur;\u00e2\u0080\u0094and\n      alludes to similar forms in Prov. xxvi. 4, 5. NEWCOME.\n\n  197 2 Kings iv. 29.\n\n  198 This was near the passover; when Jesus, going to celebrate it at\n      Jerusalem, plainly indicated that men ought to worship _there_;\n      contrary to the practice of the Samaritans, who, in opposition to\n      the Holy City, had set up a temple at Gerazim. Hence the cause of\n      their hostility to him as well as to all others travelling in that\n      direction _at that season_. This account perfectly harmonizes with\n      the respectful deportment of the Samaritans towards him at the time\n      of his interview with the woman at Jacob\u00e2\u0080\u0099s well, John iv. 1-42; for\n      he was then coming _from_ Judea, and it was not the season of\n      resorting thither for any purposes of devotion.

Yet it is\n      nowhere directly asserted; and the manner in which it is slightly\n      mentioned or alluded to by the sacred writers, is worthy of\n      particular notice, as a proof of their veracity, never met with, in\n      works of fiction. Compare Matth. xxiv. 3, and xxvi. 30; Mark xiii.\n      3, and xiv. 26; Luke vi. 12, and xxi. 37, 38, and xxii. 39; John\n      viii. 1, 2, and xviii. 1.\n\n  204 Lev. xx. 10.

The lawyer sought to learn from Jesus the terms of the\n      condition on which eternal life could be attained; and was made to\n      answer for himself that, by the law, it was attainable by nothing\n      short of the highest degree of love, to God and to his neighbour.\n      The lawyer thus was reminded, out of his  own code, that, this being\n      a condition precedent, he could have no title to that which was\n      promised, unless he fully performed every part of the condition; and\n      that in this sense, whosoever offended in one point, or was\n      deficient in performing any part of the condition, was guilty of\n      all\u00e2\u0080\u0094lost the benefit of all. If he murmured at the hardship of\n      losing the reward of all the good deeds he had done, merely for the\n      omission to do a little more; the well-known rule of law and of\n      reason would teach him that nothing is to be allowed for acts of\n      past performance of a condition precedent, unless they are\n      beneficial to the party for whom they are performed.\n\n  212 A note of minute accuracy in the historian, Jericho being situated\n      in the plain or valley of Jordan, and Jerusalem being among the\n      mountains of Judea.\n\n  213 An incidental and very natural allusion to the well-known custom of\n      that country.

Thus Matt. v. 9, reduces to a\n      plain assertion, what Mark informs us was a reply to an inquiry made\n      by the disciples apart. Or, we may suppose with Le Clerc, that this\n      assertion was first advanced to the Pharisees, and then repeated to\n      the disciples.

NEWCOME.\n\n  226 According to St. Mark, Jesus comes to Jericho; by which may be meant\n      that he is a temporary inhabitant of that city. See Mark vi. 1, and\n      viii. 22. Jesus therefore may be represented, (Matt. xx. 29; Mark x.\n      46,) not as _finally leaving_ Jericho for Jerusalem, but as\n      _occasionally going out_ of Jericho; in which city he had made some\n      abode, it matters not for how few days. See Mark xi. 19. Jericho was\n      a very considerable city; and we do not read that it was visited by\n      our Lord at any other time. We may therefore suppose that Jesus,\n      accompanied by his disciples and the multitude, and intent on his\n      great work of propagating the gospel, went out of this city, knowing\n      that a fit occasion of working a miracle would present itself; and\n      that on his return, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, (Luke xviii. 35,)\n      he restored the blind men to sight. It is likewise probable that\n      Jesus, having given this proof of his divine mission, or foreseeing\n      that so great a miracle would create too much attention in the\n      people, prudently and humbly passed through Jericho on his return to\n      it, (Luke xix. 1,) and continued his journey to Jerusalem.\n\n      As to the remaining difficulty, that Matthew mentions two blind men,\n      and the other Evangelists only one, I must refer to Le Clerc\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      maxim, before quoted; (see \u00c2\u00a7 57, note): adding that Bartimeus may\n      have been the more remarkable of the two, and the more eminent for\n      his faith in Jesus. NEWCOME.\n\n  227 Here is a fine allusion to historical facts, first observed by Le\n      Clerc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThus Herod the Great solicited the kingdom of Judea at Rome,\n      (Jos. Antiq. Jud. XIV. xiv. 4, 5; XV. vi. 6, 7,) and was appointed\n      king by the interest of Anthony with the senate; and afterwards he\n      sailed to Rhodes, divested himself of his diadem, and received it\n      again from Augustus. In like manner his sons Archelaus and Antipas\n      repaired to the imperial city, that they might obtain the kingdom on\n      their father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death; and we read, (Jos. Antiq. Jud.

This law was\n      imposed as a standing mark of distinction between them and other\n      nations; and a trial of prince and people, whether they had\n      confidence in God their deliverer, who wanted neither horses nor\n      footmen to fight his battles. It was observed for near four hundred\n      years, until some time in the reign of Solomon; for David himself\n      rode on a mule; as did Solomon also on the day of his coronation. 1\n      Kings i. 33, 34. See Judges x. 4, and xii. 14; 1 Saml. xxv. 20.\n      Subsequently the kings of Israel and Judah violated this command, by\n      copying the example of the neighbouring princes in the establishment\n      of their cavalry. The displeasure of God for this offence is\n      indicated by several of the prophets: Isaiah ii. 6, 7, and xxxi. 1;\n      Hosea xiv. 3, and i. 7; Micah v. 10, 11.\u00e2\u0080\u0094In opposition to the\n      character of these warlike and disobedient princes, it was predicted\n      that Messiah would come as a just king, having salvation;\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\n      deliverer\u00e2\u0080\u0094riding upon an ass, after the manner of the ancient\n      deliverers of Israel, who came only in the strength and power of the\n      Lord.

Dr. Lardner says, Serm. v. 2, p. 316, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is well\n      known to be very common with all writers, to use the plural number\n      when one person only is intended. Nor is it impossible that others\n      might have some uneasiness about it, though they were far from being\n      so disgusted at it as Judas was. And their concern for the poor was\n      sincere; his was self-interested, and mere pretence.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also\n      Grotius _in loc_.

Both actions are consistent; and St. John, in\n      his supplemental history, may very well have added the respectful\n      conduct of Mary, that, after having anointed Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, she\n      proceeded to anoint his feet, and even to wipe them with her hair.\n      Newcome.\n\n  259 The other Evangelists mention that indignation was caused by the\n      supposed waste of the ointment: John fixes it upon Judas. That Judas\n      went to the High Priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the evening or night of our Wednesday,\n      may be collected from Matth. xxvi. 14, 17, and the parallel places;\n      and he seems to have acted partly from disgust at what had passed.\n      The story has a remarkably apt connection with the preceding and\n      subsequent history. The Jewish rulers consult how they may take\n      Jesus by craft, and without raising a tumult among the people. An\n      incident happens, which offends one of Jesus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s familiar attendants,\n      who immediately repairs to the enemies of Jesus, and receives from\n      them a bribe to betray him in the absence of the multitude. Newcome.\n\n  260 Here is a very natural, yet incidental recognition of a rule,\n      universally respected among the Jews, that this feast was to be\n      celebrated not alone, but by companies of not less than ten persons.\n      See JOSEPHUS, Bell.

When\n      _gallicinium (cock-crowing)_ stands alone, it means this latter\n      time, which is referred to, Aristoph. Eccles. 390, Juv. Sat. ix.\n      107. The four Evangelists therefore denote the same time,\u00e2\u0080\u0094sc.\n      galliciniis secundis, as Ammianus expresses it, 1. 22; and any part\n      of the period thus marked out may be understood.

NEWCOME.\n\n  264 In the animated language of the prophets, their predictions are\n      often announced under the form of commands. The prophet Isaiah, in\n      the sublime prediction he has given us of the fate of the king of\n      Babylon, thus foretells the destruction of his family:\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Prepare\n      slaughter for his children_, &c. Isa. xiv. 21. The prophet Jeremiah\n      in like manner foretells the approaching destruction of the children\n      of Zion: _Call for the mourning women, that they may come: and send\n      for cunning women; and let them make haste, and take up a wailing_,\n      &c. Jer. ix. 17, 18. There, matter of sorrow is predicted, by\n      commanding the common attendants on mourning and lamentation to be\n      gotten in readiness; here, warning is given of the most imminent\n      dangers, by orders to make the customary preparation against\n      violence, and to account a weapon more necessary than a garment.\n      CAMPBELL, _in loc_.\n\n  265 Isa. liii. 12.\n\n  266 This account of the institution of the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supper is corroborated\n      by that of Paul, in 1 Cor. xi. 23-25, which is usually inserted by\n      Harmonists in this place as parallel testimony; but as the plan of\n      this work leads me to deal with the four Gospels alone, the\n      insertion of other parts of Scripture in the text, here and\n      elsewhere, is omitted.\n\n  267 The Evangelists have determined, by some general expressions, the\n      order of the following events between the sitting down to the\n      paschal supper, and the going to Gethsemane. Before the eating of\n      the paschal lamb, Jesus rises from supper to wash the disciples\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n      feet. John xiii. 1, 4. While they are eating, a declaration is made\n      of Judas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treachery, and the bread is instituted, Matt. xxvi. 21,\n      26. See also Mark. After, the cup is instituted, Luke xxii. 20; 1\n      Cor. xi. 25. But as to the particular and precise order of the facts\n      and discourses during this period, Pilkington\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words relating to\n      one of them are applicable to all. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is observable that St. Luke\n      mentions the institution of the communion before the declaration of\n      Judas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s treachery; whereas the other Evangelists place these in a\n      different order. But it is a liberty I think very allowable in any\n      historian, to neglect taking notice of the exact order of all the\n      facts, when he is only giving a general account of what was done at\n      a certain time. And if so, whichsoever was the true successive\n      order, there can be no just imputation upon any of the Evangelists\n      for neglecting to observe it in the narration.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Harm. p. 52.\n      NEWCOME.\n\n  268 The use of the word _testament_, (_diatheke_,) in a sense involving\n      also the idea of a _covenant_, and in connexion with the\n      circumstances of a compact, has greatly perplexed many English\n      readers of the Bible. The difficulty occurs in Matt. 26, 28, and the\n      parallel places, where our Lord employs the word _testament_, or\n      last will, in connexion with the sacrificial shedding of his own\n      blood; a ceremony which, by means of a suitable animal, usually was\n      adopted among the ancients, upon the making of the most solemn\n      engagements; and instead of which, the mutual partaking of the\n      sacrament of the Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Supper, by the contracting parties, was\n      substituted among Christians in later times. The same embarrassment\n      occurs, perhaps in a greater degree, in the exposition of several\n      passages in the eighth and ninth chapters of the Epistle to the\n      Hebrews, (manifestly written by a profound lawyer, be he Paul or\n      Apollos), where he uses language applicable indifferently both to a\n      covenant _inter vivos_ and a last will. For with us, a testament is\n      simply a declaration of the last will of the testator, in regard to\n      the disposition of his property after his decease, irrespective of\n      any consent, or even knowledge, at the time, on the part of him to\n      whom the estate is given; while a covenant requires the mutual\n      consent of both parties, as essential to its existence. The one is\n      simply the _ultima voluntas_ of an individual, the other is the\n      _aggregatio mentium_ of both or all.\n\n      The solution of this difficulty belongs rather to theologians, whose\n      province it is by no means intended here to invade; but perhaps a\n      reference to the laws and usages in force in Judea in the times of\n      our Saviour and his Apostles may furnish some aid, which a lawyer\n      might contribute without transgressing the limit of his profession.\n\n      It is first to be observed that the municipal laws of Greece and\n      Rome were strikingly similar; those of Greece having been freely\n      imported into the Roman jurisprudence. In like manner, the\n      similarity of the Grecian laws and usages with those extant in Asia\n      Minor, indicated a common origin; and thus, what Greece derived from\n      Egypt and the states of Asia Minor, these states, after many ages,\n      received again as the laws of their Roman masters. It should also be\n      remembered that Palestine had been reduced to a Roman province some\n      years before the time of our Saviour; long enough, indeed, to have\n      become familiar with Roman laws and usages, even had they been\n      previously unknown; and that Paul, to whom the Epistle to the\n      Hebrews is generally attributed, was himself a thorough-bred lawyer,\n      well versed in the customs of his country, whether ancient or\n      modern. Among those nations, the civil magistrate often exercised\n      the functions of the priesthood, these dignities being in some\n      respects identical; and thus, whatever was transacted before the\n      magistrate, might naturally seem to partake of the character of an\n      act of religion. Covenants were always made with particular\n      formalities, and to those of graver nature, religious solemnities\n      were often superadded. They were frequently confirmed by an oath,\n      the most solemn form of which was taken standing before the altar;\n      and whosoever swore by the altar, swore by the sacrifice thereon,\n      and was held as firmly bound as though he had passed between the\n      dismembered parts of the victim. Of the latter kind was the oath, by\n      which God confirmed his covenant with Abraham (Gen. xv.) when the\n      visible light of his presence passed between the pieces which the\n      patriarch had divided and laid \u00e2\u0080\u009ceach piece one against another.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n      With these things in view, we may now look at some of the modes of\n      transferring property, practised by the nations alluded to.\n\n      Among the methods of alienation or sale of property by the owner, in\n      his lifetime, was that which in the Roman law was termed\n      _mancipatio_; a mode by which the vendor conveyed property to the\n      purchaser, each party being present, either in person or by his\n      agent, representative, or factor. Five witnesses were requisite, one\n      of whom was called _libripens_, or the balance-holder. This form had\n      its origin in the sale of goods by weight, but was gradually\n      extended to all sales; and the practice was for the buyer to strike\n      the balance with a piece of money called a _sestertius_, which was\n      immediately paid over to the vendor as part of the price; and hence\n      the expression _per \u00c3\u00a6s et libram vendere_.\n\n      Wills or testaments were made with great solemnity. One method among\n      the Romans, probably common, in its principal traits, to the other\n      nations before mentioned, was termed the testament _per \u00c3\u00a6s et\n      libram_, it being effected in the form of a sale. This mode seems to\n      have been resorted to whenever the estate was given to a stranger,\n      (_h\u00c3\u00a6res extraneus_,) to the exclusion of the _h\u00c3\u00a6res suus_, or\n      _necessarius_, or, as we should say, the heir at law; and it was\n      founded on the purchase of the estate by the adopted heir, who\n      succeeded to the privileges of the child. The forms of a sale by\n      _mancipatio_ were therefore scrupulously observed; the presence and\n      agreement of the purchaser, either in person or by his\n      representative or negotiator, being necessary to its validity. The\n      reason for requiring this form was because it _involved a covenant_\n      on the part of the adopted heir or legatee, by which he became bound\n      to pay all the debts of the testator. Having entered into this\n      covenant, he had the best possible title in law to the inheritance,\n      namely, that of a purchaser for a valuable consideration. Among the\n      Greeks, and probably among the Romans also, this was transacted in\n      the presence of a magistrate, who sanctioned it by his sentence of\n      approval. This was the most ancient form of a will; and it does not\n      seem to have been abrogated until the time of Constantine.\n\n      Now, when our Saviour speaks of the _new testament in his blood_, or\n      of his _blood of the new testament_, and when Paul uses similar\n      forms of expression may not the figure have reference to the custom\n      above stated? And if so, may not this custom guide us to the true\n      meaning of the words? Does it intimate to us that the promised\n      inheritance was first given to man, as it were by a testament in\n      this ancient form, upon a covenant of _his own perfect obedience_ to\n      every part of the law of God; that having broken this covenant, his\n      title became forfeited; that the inheritance was afterwards\n      promised, in the same manner, to every one, Jew or Gentile, upon a\n      new covenant and condition, namely of a true _faith_ in Christ; a\n      faith evinced in the fruits of a holy life; that this inheritance by\n      a new testament and covenant was negociated, as it were, and\n      obtained for man by the mediation of Jesus Christ, (\u00e2\u0080\u009cthe mediator of\n      the new testament,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Heb. 9. 15,) as the representative of all who\n      should accept it by such faith, and their surety for the performance\n      of its conditions; that it was purchased by _his_ obedience and\n      solemnized by the sacrifice of himself as the victim?\n\n      This solution is suggested with much diffidence. That it carries\n      these passages clear of all difficulty is not pretended. The very\n      nature of the subject renders it difficult of illustration by any\n      reference to human affairs; and the embarrassment is proportionally\n      increased, whenever the simile is pressed beyond its principal point\n      of resemblance.\n\n      See Ayliffe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Pandect, pp. 349, 393, 367-369.

But learned men have related instances of mental agony so\n      great as to force the blood through the pores; and if this has ever\n      occurred, it may well be believed to have occurred in the present\n      case. See _Bloomfield_ and _A. Clarke_, in loc. It should be\n      observed, however, that Luke does not directly affirm that it was\n      blood. He only _compares_ the sweat to that of blood, using a term\n      of similitude, (_quasi_ grumi sanguinis\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Beza_; _tanquam_\n      demissiones sanguinis\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Tremellius_; sicut gutt\u00c3\u00a6 sanguinis\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Vulg_.\n      and _Molinaus_;) which may signify no more than that the drops of\n      sweat were as large as drops of blood, which, from its viscidity,\n      are very large.\n\n  272 No other Evangelist mentions the cause of their slumber, except\n      Luke, who ascribes it to their sorrow. It is observable, that Luke\n      was a physician, (Col. iv. 14,) and therefore well knew that deep\n      mental distress frequently induced sleep. To this cause may perhaps\n      be referred the fact, that persons condemned to die are often waked\n      from sound sleep by the executioner. The internal evidence here\n      afforded of the truth of Luke\u00e2\u0080\u0099s narrative, is corroborated by his\n      notice of the bloody sweat, ver. 44, and of the miraculous healing\n      of the ear of Malchus, ver. 51; facts which are not related by any\n      other Evangelist, but which would naturally attract the attention of\n      a physician.\n\n  273 Gen. ix. 6.\n\n  274 In the order of events, Jesus first voluntarily discriminates\n      himself; after which Judas gives the agreed sign to his enemies.\n      Newcome.\n\n  275 Lenfant and Bp. Pearce think that Peter was named by John, because\n      he was then dead; and that he was not named by the other Evangelists\n      because when they wrote he was living, and the action might have\n      subjected him to public justice, or at least to reproach. NEWCOME.\n\n  276 Here is a minute indication of veracity, which would have been lost\n      upon us but for the narrative of John. Matthew only states the fact\n      that the maid in the porch recognized Peter as one of the disciples\n      of Jesus; but John (xviii. 16,) informs us how she knew him to be\n      so; namely, because he was brought in by John, who was a frequent\n      guest at the house of her master the high priest. BLUNT, Veracity\n      &c., Sect. i. 12, 18.\n\n  277 Probably by way of compliment to the past high priest who was also\n      the father-in-law of Caiaphas. If this circumstance never happened,\n      it is difficult to discover how the introduction of it could serve\n      the purposes of fiction. See Roberts, Light Shining, &c. pp. 171,\n      172.\n\n  278 The seeming contradiction between Luke, who relates that it _was a\n      man_ who charged Peter with being a follower of Jesus, and Matthew\n      and Mark who state that he was accused by _a maid_, is reconciled by\n      attending to the narrative of John, (xviii. 25,) who writes, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_They\n      said_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Whence it appears that there were several who spake on this\n      occasion, and that each Evangelist refers to the accusation which\n      made the deepest impression on his own mind. See MICHAELIS and Bp.\n      MIDDLETON, cited in 4 HORNE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S _Introd_. p. 258, note 1.\n\n  279 Matthew and Mark relate Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denials of Christ after his\n      condemnation, and the insults consequent upon it. It is plain that\n      they happened while the High Priest and council were sitting in\n      judgment. But instances of recurring in this manner to what had been\n      omitted in its proper place are common in the Gospels; and in this\n      place the thread of the narration is preserved unbroken.\n\n      It having been expressly mentioned by each Evangelist, that Peter\n      would _thrice_ deny Jesus, we may conclude that each has related the\n      _three_ denials which Jesus foretold.\n\n      _Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first denial_. Peter was _without_, or _beneath_, in the\n      hall of Caiaphas\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. Dr. Scott, on Matth. xxvi. 3, observes\n      that _aule_ signifies an house, (Luke xi. 21,) and that emphatically\n      it signifies the king\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house, or palace. But in Luke xxii. 55, it\n      seems to signify a spacious apartment, probably the High Priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      judgment-hall. It was the place in which Jesus stood before the High\n      Priest, (Luke xxii. 61,) and had an _atrium_ or _vestibulum_ at its\n      entrance. This was an unfit place for the tribunal of the High\n      Priest at such an hour, (John xviii. 18.) Sir John Chardin says, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn\n      the lower Asia the day is always hot; and in the height of summer\n      the nights are as cold as at Paris in the month of March.\u00e2\u0080\u009d It\n      remains therefore that we understand it of a spacious chamber, such\n      as Shaw mentions, Travels, 4to. pp. 207, 8.\n\n      Peter was not in the _higher_ part, where Jesus stood before the\n      High Priest; but _without_ that division of the hall, and in the\n      _lower_ part, with the servants and officers. The damsel, who kept\n      the door, had entered into the hall when she charged Peter.\n\n      _Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second denial_. Peter, having once denied Jesus, naturally\n      retired from the place where his accuser was, to the vestibule of\n      the hall, (Matt. xxvi. 71); and it was the time of the first\n      cock-crowing, or soon after midnight. After remaining here a short\n      time, perhaps near an hour, another damsel sees him, and says to\n      those who were standing by in the vestibule, that he was one of\n      them. Peter, to avoid this charge, withdraws into the hall, and\n      stands and warms himself, (John xviii. 25.) The damsel, and those to\n      whom she had spoken, follow him; the communication between the\n      places being immediate. Here a _man_ enforces the charge of the\n      damsel, according to Luke; and _others_ urge it according to John,\n      (though by him the plural may be used for the singular,) and Peter\n      denies Jesus vehemently.\n\n      _Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s third denial_. Peter was now in the hall. Observe Matt.\n      xxvi. 75, and Luke xxii. 62. He was also within sight of Jesus,\n      though at such a distance from him that Jesus could know what passed\n      only in a supernatural way. About an hour after his second denial,\n      those who stood by founded a charge against him on his being a\n      Galilean, which, Luke says, one in particular strongly affirmed,\n      (though here Matthew and Mark may use the plural for the singular,)\n      and which, according to John, was supported by one of Malchus\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      relations. This occasioned a more vehement denial than before; and\n      immediately the cock crew the second time. The first denial may have\n      been between our twelve and one; and the second between our two and\n      three. We must further observe, that Matt. xxvi. 57, lays the scene\n      of Peter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s denials in the house of Caiaphas; whereas the\n      transactions of John xviii. 15-23 seem to have passed in the house\n      of Annas. But John xviii. 24 is here transposed to its regular\n      place, with Le Clerc. NEWCOME.\n\n  280 Matthew alone states this fact; and he states nothing in explanation\n      of it. The other Evangelists add another fact, which shows that the\n      Jews were quite consistent in asking him to designate who struck\n      him, namely, that they had previously \u00e2\u0080\u009cblindfolded him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now the\n      omissions of particulars are characteristic of one to whom it never\n      occurs that they are wanted to make his statement credible, but who,\n      conscious of his own integrity, states his facts and leaves them to\n      their fate; and they cannot fairly be accounted for, upon any other\n      supposition than the truth of the narrative. BLUNT, Veracity, &c.,\n      _sec_. i. 10.\n\n  281 Jesus seems here almost to have challenged inquiry into the assault\n      so lately committed by Peter upon the servant of the high priest.\n      St. Luke, however, states a fact which accounts for their not making\n      such inquiry, ch. xxii. 51. _He touched his ear and healed him_. An\n      inquiry into the truth would have frustrated the malicious purpose\n      of the enemies of Jesus, by proving his own compassionate nature,\n      his submission to the laws, and his miraculous powers. Blunt,\n      Veracity, &c., sect. i. 19.\n\n  282 Here is an obscure intimation that neither Pilate nor Herod were\n      residents of Jerusalem; and the manner of the insinuation deserves\n      notice, as a mark of conscious veracity in the narrator. Now it\n      appears from Josephus, that this Herod was the very opposite of his\n      successor, Herod Agrippa; the former being partial to the Greeks,\n      and a hater of the Jews; while the latter so loved the Jews that he\n      took pleasure in constantly dwelling at Jerusalem. It is therefore\n      evident that Herod\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence at Jerusalem at this time was merely\n      casual; as that of Pilate certainly was, the Roman governors\n      residing at C\u00c3\u00a6sarea. See Josephus, Ant. xviii. iv. \u00c2\u00a7 1.-xix. vii. \u00c2\u00a7\n      3.-xx. iv. \u00c2\u00a7 4. BLUNT, Veracity, &c., sect. II. 11.\n\n  283 The accuracy of Luke, as a man of education, is observable in this\n      statement of the formal judgment pronounced by Pilate, which is only\n      implied in the narratives of the other Evangelists.\n\n  284 The apparent contradiction between John and Mark, (ch. xv. 25,) who\n      mentions the third hour, is reconciled by Dr. Campbell, in a\n      critical note upon the force of the expressions in the original,\n      which he interprets as equivalent to saying, in the one case, that\n      it was past _three_, and in the other, that it was _towards six_.\n      See CAMPBELL, _in loc_.\n\n  285 The passage here quoted is found in the prophecy of Zechariah, and\n      not in Jeremiah. Dr. Lightfoot says, that anciently among the Jews\n      the Old Testament was divided into three parts. The first, beginning\n      with the law, was called _The Law_. The second, beginning with\n      Psalms, was called _The Psalms_. The third, beginning with the\n      prophecy of Jeremiah, which anciently stood first, was called\n      _Jeremiah_, under which name all quotations from the prophets were\n      made. See A. CLARKE, _in loc._ JENNINGS, Jewish Antiq. pp. 594, 595.\n      Others account for the apparent error in Matthew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quotation, by\n      supposing that he omitted the name of the prophet, as he frequently\n      did in his citations of scripture, and that the name of Jeremiah was\n      inserted by a subsequent copyist. 1 HORNE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S _Introd_. p. 582.\n\n  286 Zech. xi. 12, seq.  Jer. xxxii. 6, seq.\n\n  287 Clement of Alexandria and Jerome both relate that Mark wrote this\n      Gospel at _Rome_, and we find in Romans xiv. 13, that a disciple\n      named Rufus, of considerable note, resided in that city. Admitting\n      that both Mark and Paul speak of the same person, which is highly\n      probable, as they refer to the same period of time and to a disciple\n      of distinction, there is an evident consciousness of veracity in the\n      Evangelist, in making this reference to Rufus, then living among\n      them, since he could not but have known the particulars of the\n      crucifixion, in which his own father was so intimately concerned.\n      BLUNT\u00e2\u0080\u0099S Veracity, &c., sect. i. 14.

It is enough that the Evangelists agree as to the main\n      article, \u00e2\u0080\u009c_the King of the Jews_,\u00e2\u0080\u009d referred to, John xix. 21. That\n      their manner is to regard the sense, rather than the words, appears\n      from many places. Compare Matt. iii. 17, and ix. 11, and xv. 27, and\n      xvi. 6, 9, and xix. 18, and xx. 33, and xxi. 9, and xxvi. 39, 64,\n      70, and xxviii. 5, 6, with the parallel verses in this Harmony.\n      Compare also John xi. 40, with ver. 23, 25. One of the most solemn\n      and awful of our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s discourses is, in some parts, variously\n      expressed. See Matt. xxvi. 28, Mark xiv. 24, Luke xxii. 20, 1 Cor.\n      xi. 25. Now as each of these writers has, beyond all doubt,\n      faithfully represented the meaning of Christ, we see that it might\n      be truly done in different words, or in a different form of the same\n      words. His sentences also, sometimes admitted a difference of\n      arrangement; for the order in which two sentences, or the several\n      members of the same sentence, are disposed by St. Matthew, is, in\n      several places, inverted by St. Mark. And with regard to his\n      actions, though the most material parts of whatever they were going\n      to relate must command their attention, yet there was no such\n      superior attraction in one specific number and order of secondary\n      circumstances, as could turn their thoughts absolutely and\n      exclusively to them. This is plain from instances to the contrary.\n      One Evangelist is sometimes distinct, while another is concise; and\n      describes what the other passes over. TOWNSON, pp. 60-1.\n\n      We may reasonably suppose St. Matthew to have cited the Hebrew,\u00e2\u0080\u0094St.\n      John the Greek,\u00e2\u0080\u0094and St. Mark the Latin, which was the shortest, and\n      without mixture of foreign words. St. Mark is followed by St. Luke;\n      only that he has brought down \u00e2\u0080\u009cTHIS IS\u00e2\u0080\u009d from above, as having a\n      common reference to what stood under it. NEWCOME.\n\n  292 Is. liii. 12.\n\n  293 We have here an incidental allusion to a practice well known at that\n      time. The malefactor about to be crucified, having borne his own\n      cross to the place of execution, was stripped, and made to drink a\n      stupefying potion; the cross was then laid on the ground, the\n      sufferer distended upon it, and four soldiers, two on each side,\n      were employed in driving four large nails through his hands and\n      feet. For this service they had a right to his clothes as a\n      perquisite. See Dr. Harwood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Introd., cited in Horne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _Introd_.,\n      vol. i. pp. 94, 95.\n\n  294 Ps. xxii. 7, 8.\n\n  295 Here the common drink of the Roman soldiers is offered by them to\n      Jesus on the cross, while they are deriding him; which is a\n      different act from that in Matt. xxvii. 34, 48, as appears by the\n      place assigned to it. NEWCOME\n\n  296 What was true of only one of the malefactors is attributed to both\n      in the concise relations of Matthew and Mark; the plural being often\n      used in the Gospels for the singular. This the Evangelists\n      themselves show in some instances. Compare Mark vii. 17, and Matt.\n      xv. 15; Mark v. 31, and Luke viii. 45; Matt. xiv. 17, and Mark vi.\n      38, Luke ix. 13, John vi. 8, 9; Matt. xxvi. 8, and Mark xiv. 4, John\n      xii. 4; Matt. xxiv. 1, and Mark xiii. 1; Matt. xxvii. 37, and John\n      xix. 19; Matt. xxvii. 48, and Mark xv. 36, John xix. 29. See also\n      Luke xxii. 67. In the following places, the plural is used, while\n      the sense shows that one is spoken of. John xi. 8, Luke xx. 21, 39,\n      and xxiv. 5, Matt. xv. 1, 12.\u00e2\u0080\u0094The Evangelists, therefore, when from\n      attention to brevity they avoid particularizing, often attribute to\n      many what is said or done by single persons; nor does any striking\n      peculiarity in the case omitted, lead them to deviate from their\n      manner; for instance, the case of Judas, Matth. xxvi. 8, and the\n      parallel places. NEWCOME\n\n  297 Ps. xxii. 1.\n\n_  298 Hil_ or _Hila_ was the old Syriac for _vinegar_. Hence one of the\n      bystanders, hearing our Saviour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exclamation on the cross, thought\n      he wanted vinegar to alleviate his thirst, and straightway filled a\n      spunge. See BUCHANAN\u00e2\u0080\u0099S _Researches_, p. 153.\n\n  299 The Jews gave a literal interpretation to Mal. iv. 5, expecting\n      Elijah to appear in person, as the forerunner of the Messiah; and\n      hence they, on this occasion, sneeringly adverted to the want of\n      this testimony to the mission of Christ. JONES, _Lect_. 147. This\n      incidental allusion to the popular opinion, by Matthew and Mark, may\n      be noticed as additional evidence of their veracity.\n\n  300 The objection urged by infidels, upon this passage, against the\n      veracity of the Evangelists, from the silence of profane writers\n      concerning so remarkable an event, is met and answered by Bp. Watson\n      in his Reply to Gibbon, Let. 5. See also HORNE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S _Introd_. Vol. 1.\n      p. 210-216. The word translated _earth_, in Luke, is the same which\n      is rendered _land_, in the others, and applies equally to both.\n      Taken in the latter sense, it may limit the darkness to Judea. But\n      the Evangelists do not mention the degree of darkness; if therefore\n      it was slight, though it extended over the whole globe, the\n      objection of its not being recorded by Pliny or Seneca vanishes at\n      once.\n\n  301 Ps. lxix. 22.\n\n  302 This and the parallel verses are reconciled with John xix. 25, by\n      the following observation in Wall\u00e2\u0080\u0099s critical notes, p. 116. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMary\n      stood as yet, (John xix. 25,) so nigh the cross as to hear what\n      Christ said. But at the time of his departure, Matthew, Mark and\n      Luke say, the women stood afar off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d See also Watson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Reply to\n      Gibbon, Let. 5, (Evangelical Family Library, Vol. xiv. pp. 276,\n      277.) It is natural to suppose that our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relations and\n      friends, mentioned in John xix. 25, were too much struck with\n      commiseration and grief to remain long near the cross; and that they\n      would retire from the horror of the concluding scene. NEWCOME.\n\n  303 Here is another of those incidental allusions to existing customs,\n      which show the naturalness and veracity of the narrative. Those who\n      were crucified by the Romans are said to have been usually exposed\n      to the birds of prey; and a guard was set to prevent their friends\n      from burying the bodies. The body of Jesus therefore could not be\n      obtained for burial, without leave from Pilate; which the\n      Evangelists relate was applied for, but without explaining the\n      cause.\n\n  304 Ex. xxii. 46. Ps. xxiv. 20.\n\n  305 Zech. xii. 10.\n\n  306 We must not understand this word of the morning light. The Jewish\n      sabbath began at six in the morning, before which time our Lord\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\n      body was deposited in the tomb. NEWCOME.\n\n  307 The mention of this circumstance by Matthew, and not by the other\n      Evangelists, is in perfect keeping with his previous occupation;\n      which led him to watch for fraud, in all places where it might be\n      perpetrated.\n\n  308 This appearance of Jesus is not alluded to by any other Evangelist;\n      but it was a fact well known among the disciples, and is expressly\n      stated by Paul, in 1 Cor. xv. 5,\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cand that he was seen of Cephas,\n      then of the twelve.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n  309 This appearance of Jesus is also affirmed by Paul, in 1 Cor. xv. 5.\n\n  310 Many and perhaps most Harmonists and Commentators refer 1 Cor. xv.\n      6, to this place, where it is related that Jesus was seen of above\n      five hundred brethren at once. Such is the opinion of Dr. Robinson\n      and Bishop J. B. Sumner, and such seems to have been the opinion of\n      Abp. Newcome, Dr. Macknight, and Dr. Pilkington. See NEWCOME, in\n      loc. The fact is deemed by some to have an important bearing upon\n      the extent of the commission then given or repeated by our Lord; but\n      the plan of this work does not require any further notice of the\n      question.\n\n  311 This is perfectly consistent with the statement of Luke in Acts i.\n      12, as Bethany was not only the name of a town, but of a district of\n      Mount Olivet, adjoining the town.

And God spake all these words, saying, I am the Lord\n      thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of\n      the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou\n      shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness _of any\n      thing_ that _is_ in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath,\n      or that _is_ in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down\n      thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous\n      God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the\n      third and fourth _generation_ of them that hate me; And shewing\n      mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.\n      Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the\n      Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.\n\n  332 Lev. xxiv. 11-16. And the Israelitish woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son blasphemed the\n      name _of the Lord_, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses (and\n      his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe\n      of Dan): And they put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might\n      be shewed them. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Bring forth\n      him that hath cursed without the camp, and let all that heard _him_\n      lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone\n      him. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,\n      Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin. And he that\n      blasphemeth the name of the Lord, he shall surely be put to death,\n      _and_ all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the\n      stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the\n      name _of the Lord_, shall be put to death. See A. Clarke on Matt.\n      ix. 3.\n\n  333 Deut. xiii. 6-10. If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son,\n      or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is\n      as thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve\n      other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy fathers;\n      _Namely_, of the gods of the people which _are_ round about you,\n      nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the _one_ end of the\n      earth even unto the _other_ end of the earth; Thou shalt not consent\n      unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him,\n      neither shalt thou spare, neither shalt thou conceal him: But thou\n      shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon him to death,\n      and afterwards the hand of all the people. And thou shalt stone him\n      with _stones_ that he die; because he hath sought to thrust thee\n      away from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of\n      Egypt from the house of bondage. Deut. xviii. 20. But the prophet,\n      which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not\n      commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other\n      gods, even that prophet shall die.\n\n  334 It is true that in the Mishna it is written\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlasphemus non tenetur,\n      nisi expressit Nomen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mishna, Pars iv. p. 242. Tractatus de\n      Synedriis, cap. 7, \u00c2\u00a7 5. But these traditions were not written until\n      150 years after the time of our Saviour; and the passage, moreover,\n      seems properly to refer to that form of blasphemy which consists in\n      evil speaking of the Supreme Being, in a direct manner, rather than\n      to the other forms in which this offence, in its larger acceptation,\n      might be committed.

In some other places, where there is\n      no express reference to the power of God, the omission may be\n      attributed to the brevity of the narrative; but even in those cases,\n      such reference is plainly implied.\n\n  346 Dan. ix. 21, 23, and x. 11, 12.

Luke v. 20, 21.\n\n  348 John x. 31-33.\n\n  349 This view of the Jewish law may seem opposed to that of Dr.\n      Campbell, in his Preliminary Dissertation on the Gospels, (Vol. 2,\n      Diss. ix. Part 2); but it is evident, on examination, that he is\n      discussing the _word blasphemy_, and the propriety of its\n      application, taken in its more restricted sense of intentional and\n      direct malediction of Jehovah; and not whether the assumption of his\n      attributes and authority was or was not a violation of his law. That\n      this assumption was a heinous transgression, seems universally\n      agreed. The question, therefore, is reduced to this\u00e2\u0080\u0094whether the\n      offence was properly _termed_ blasphemy. For the _act_, by whatever\n      name it were called, was a capital crime. The Jewish judges of that\n      day held it to amount to blasphemy; and in so doing, they do not\n      appear to have given to their law a construction more expanded and\n      comprehensive than has been given by judges in our own times, to the\n      law of treason, or of sedition.\n\n  350 This was judicially and solemnly done by the members of the\n      Sanhedrim, rising from their seats, when the crime was testified to.\n      Only one witness was permitted to repeat the words; the others\n      simply stating that they heard the same which he had related. The\n      practice is thus described in the Mishna: \u00e2\u0080\u009cExactis omnibus,\n      interrogant vetustissimum testium, dicendo,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Edissere, quodcumque\n      audivisti expresse_. Tum ille hoc refert. Judices autem stant\n      erecti, vestesque discerpunt, non resarciendas. Dein secundus\n      tertiusque ait,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Ego idem, quod ille audivi_.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mishna, Pars 4.\n      Tractat. de Synedriis, cap. 7, \u00c2\u00a7 5. Upon which, Cocceius\n      remarks:\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u009cAssurgunt reverenti\u00c3\u00a6 caus\u00c3\u00a2. Mos discendarum vestium\n      probatur ex 2do Regum, xviii. 37. Hinc nata est regula,\u00e2\u0080\u0094_Qui\n      blasphemiam audit, vel ab ipso auctore vel ex alio, tenetur vestem\n      discerpere_. Ratio est, ut semper ob oculos et animum versetur\n      m\u00c3\u00a6roris aut indignationis mnemosynon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Coccej. in loc. \u00c2\u00a7 11, 12. The\n      custom is fully explained, with particular reference to the high\n      priest at the trial of Jesus, by Hedenus, _De Scissione Vestium_,\n      38, 42. (In Ugolini Thesauro, tom. xxix, fol. 1025. &c.)\n\n  351 That the Jews understood Jesus to make himself equal with God, is\n      maintained by Mr. Salvador, himself a Jew, in his Histoire des\n      Institutions de Mo\u00c3\u00afse et du Peuple H\u00c3\u00a9breu, Liv. iv. ch. 3, p. 81, of\n      which chapter a translation is given at the end of this article. Mr.\n      Noah, also a Jew, seems to be of opinion, that Jesus was brought to\n      trial under the law in Deut. xiii. 1-11. See his Discourse on the\n      Restoration of the Jews, p. 19. But whether he was charged with a\n      blasphemous usurpation of the attributes of Deity, or with sedition,\n      in inciting the people to serve another god, meaning himself, the\n      difference is of no importance; the essence of the offence in both\n      cases being the same.\n\n  352 Matt. xxvi. 60-65. This view of the nature of the offence with which\n      Jesus was charged, is confirmed by the learned jurist, Chr.\n      Thomasius, in his Dissertatio de injusto Pilati judicio, \u00c2\u00a7 11, 12,\n      and by the authors whom he there cites. Dissert. Thomasii. vol. 1,\n      p. 5.\n\n  353 John ii. 13-22.\n\n  354 Matt. xxvi. 63-66.\n\n  355 Tacit. Annal. xv. 31. See M. Dupin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trial of Jesus, p. 57-59,\n      (Amer. Ed.) Chr. Thomasius, Dissertatio de injusto Pilati judicio, \u00c2\u00a7\n      12, 60. The want of this power was admitted by the Jews, in their\n      reply to Pilate, when he required them to judge Jesus according to\n      their own law, and they replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is not lawful for us to put any\n      man to  death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d John xviii. 31.\n\n      This point has been held in different ways by learned men. Some are\n      of opinion that the Sanhedrim had power to inflict death for\n      offences touching religion, though not for political offences; and\n      that it was with reference to the charge of treason that they said\n      to Pilate what has just been cited from St. John. They say that,\n      though the Sanhedrim had convicted Jesus of blasphemy, yet they\n      dared not execute that sentence, for fear of a sedition of the\n      people:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that they therefore craftily determined to throw on Pilate\n      the odium of his destruction, by accusing him of treason; and hence,\n      after condemning him, they consulted further, as stated in Matt.\n      xxvii. 1, 2. Mark xv. 1, how to effect this design:\u00e2\u0080\u0094that when Pilate\n      found no fault in him, and directed them to take and crucify him,\n      some replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have a law, and by our law he ought to die,\u00e2\u0080\u009d (John\n      xix. 7,) to intimate to Pilate that Jesus was guilty of death by the\n      Jewish law also, as well as the Roman, and that therefore he would\n      not lose any popularity by condemning him. See Zorrius, Hist. Fisci\n      Judaici, ch. 2, \u00c2\u00a7 2, (in Ugolini Thesaur. tom. 26, col. 1001-1003.)\n      The same view is taken by Deylingius, De Jud\u00c3\u00a6orum Jure Gladii, \u00c2\u00a7 10,\n      11, 12, (in Ugolin. Thesaur. tom. 29, col. 1189-1192.) But he\n      concludes that in all capital cases, there was an appeal from the\n      Sanhedrim to the Pr\u00c3\u00a6tor; and that without the approval of the\n      latter, the sentence of the Sanhedrim could not be executed. Ibid. \u00c2\u00a7\n      15, col. 1196. Molin\u00c3\u00a6us understood the Jewish law in the same\n      manner. See his Harmony of the Gospels, note on John xviii. 31. C.\n      Molin\u00c3\u00a6i Opera, tom. 5. pp. 603, 604. But this opinion is refuted by\n      what is said by M. Dupin, Trial, &c., \u00c2\u00a7 8, and by Thomasius, above\n      cited.\n\n  356 See M. Dupin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Trial of Jesus, pp. 55-62. His authorities are\n      Loiseau, Godefroy, and Cujas, the two latter of whom he cites as\n      follows:\u00e2\u0080\u0094Procurator C\u00c3\u00a6saris _fungens vice pr\u00c3\u00a6sidis_ potest\n      cognoscere _de causis criminalibus_. Godefroy, in his note (letter\n      S) upon the 3rd law of the code, _Ibi caus\u00c3\u00a6 fiscales_, &c. And he\n      cites several others, which I have verified, and which are most\n      precise to the same effect. See particularly the 4th law of the\n      Code, _Ad. leg. fab. de plag._, and the 2nd law of the Code, _De\n      P\u00c5\u0093nis_.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Procuratoribus C\u00c3\u00a6saris data est jurisdictio in causis\n      fiscalibus pecuniariis, non in criminalibus, nisi quum fungebantur\n      _vice pr\u00c3\u00a6sidum_; ut Pontius Pilatus fuit procurator C\u00c3\u00a6saris _vice\n      pr\u00c3\u00a6sidis_ in Syria.

I regard this judgement as conclusive\n      evidence of the innocence of the accused. Pilate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strenuous\n      endeavour to release him instead of Barabbas, and his solemn washing\n      his own hands of the guilt of his blood, though they show the\n      strength of his own convictions, yet add no legal force to the\n      judgement itself.\n\n  362 John xix. 12.\n\n  363 Luke xxiii. 24.\n\n  364 See M.

It was not in this\n      sense that Jesus Christ used it; for in that case it would have\n      occasioned no great sensation.  Besides, if we should assume, in\n      order to make it a subject of accusation against these Jews, that\n      Jesus did not expressly declare himself to be God, we should be\n      exposed to this rejoinder: Why then do you believe in him?\n\n  372 See Deut. iv. 15, and xiii. per tot.\n\n  373 John vi. 39-42. Matt. xiii. 55.\n\n  374 This fact is clearly established as possible; and we must observe\n      that till then there had been neither opposition nor enmity in the\n      minds of this people, since they had listened to him with the\n      greatest attention, and did not hesitate to acknowledge in him all\n      that public law permitted them to do, viz., a prophet, a highly\n      inspired man.\n\n  375 John x. 30-33.\n\n  376 Matt. x. 34.

At this time the high priest presided\n      over the senate, so that the guards of the high priest, of the\n      elders and the temple, were no other than the legal militia.\n\n  387 John xviii. 10, 11.\n\n  388 Mark xiv. 50.  Matt. xxvi. 56.\n\n  389 Matt. xxvi. 60, 61. And the last came two false witnesses, and said,\n      this fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to\n      build it in three days. Mark xiv. 57, 58. And there arose certain\n      and bare false witness against him, saying, We heard him say, I will\n      destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I\n      will build another made without hands. John ii. 19, 21, 22. Jesus\n      answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days\n      I will raise it up.  But he spake of the temple of his body. When,\n      therefore, he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that\n      he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the\n      word which Jesus had said.\n\n  390 I repeat that the expression _son of God_, includes here the idea of\n      God himself; the fact is already established, and all the subsequent\n      events confirm it. Observe, also, that I quote the narrative of only\n      one of the parties to this great proceeding.\n\n  391 Deut. xxviii. 20. But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a\n      word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that\n      shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.\n\n  392 Matt. xxvii. 1. Mark xv. 1.\n\n  393 The duties of Pilate were to inform himself whether the sentences\n      given did or did not affect the interests of Rome; there his part\n      ended.  Thus it is not astonishing that this procurator, doubtless\n      little acquainted with the Jewish laws, signed the decree for the\n      arrest of Jesus, although he did not find him guilty.  We shall see\n      hereafter that there were then many parties among the Jews, among\n      whom were the Herodians or serviles, partisans of the house of\n      Herod, and devoted to the foreign interests.  These are they who\n      speak continually of C\u00c3\u00a6sar, of rendering to C\u00c3\u00a6sar the tribute due to\n      C\u00c3\u00a6sar; they also insist that Jesus called himself _king of the\n      Jews_, but this charge was reckoned as nothing before the senate,\n      and was not of a nature alone to merit capital punishment.\n\n  394 See Matt. xxvii. 27. Mark xv. 16. John xix. 2.\n\n  395 John xix. 7.\n\n  396 The sending back of Jesus to Herod, which, according to the Gospel\n      of St. Luke, Pilate would have done, is not stated by the other\n      Evangelists, and does not at all change the judicial question.\n      Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee, and of Perea, had no authority\n      in Jerusalem.  Upon his visit to this city, Pilate, according to St.\n      Luke, would, out of respect, have caused Jesus to appear before this\n      ally of the Romans, because Jesus was surnamed the Galilean, though\n      originally from Judea.  But to whatever tribe he belonged, the\n      nature of the accusation would still have required, according to the\n      Hebrew law, that he should be judged by the senate of Jerusalem.\n\n  397 Matt. xvii. 42, 43.\n\n  398 This Analysis first appeared in the _Gazette des Tribunaux_.\n\n  399 Joshua vii. 19, &c.\n\n  400 By this, says Father Lamy, we may understand what the mixture of\n      wine and myrrh was, which they presented to Jesus on the cross, and\n      which he would not drink. _Introd. to the reading of the Holy\n      Scriptures_, chap. vi.

Judaic. lib. 18, cap. 3 & 6.\n\n  409 Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest\u00e2\u0080\u0099s palace, and went\n      in and sat with the servants to see the end. Matt. xxvi. 58. So also\n      the young man spoken of by St. Mark, xiv. 51: And there followed him\n      a certain young man, &c.\n\n_  410 De Crimine_ pr\u00c3\u00a6sidis cognitio est. Cujas, xix.

See particularly the 4th law of the Code, _Ad leg. fab.\n      de plag._, and the 2nd law of the Code, _De P\u00c5\u0093nis_.\n\n  412 Procuratoribus C\u00c3\u00a6saris data est jurisdictio in causis fiscalibus\n      pecuniariis, non in criminalibus, nisi quum fungebantur _vice\n      pr\u00c3\u00a6sidum_; ut Pontius Pilatus fuit procurator C\u00c3\u00a6saris _vice\n      pr\u00c3\u00a6sidis_ in Syria.

Acts xxiii. 29.\n\n  415 Gerhard makes the following unanswerable dilemma upon this point.\n      \u00e2\u0080\u009cBe consistent with thyself, Pilate; for, if Christ is innocent, why\n      dost thou not send him away acquitted? And if thou believest him\n      deserving of chastisement with rods, why dost thou proclaim him to\n      be innocent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d _Gerh.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\nrequirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\nwith offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\nand addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including\nchecks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please\nvisit: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.\n\n\n      General Information About Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 electronic works.\n\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\nwith any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eBook\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\n(zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n\n    http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2, including how\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***FINIS***\n\f","id":506,"split":"train"}
