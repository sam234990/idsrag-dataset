Frollo is torn between his obsessive lust for Esmeralda and the rules of the Notre Dame Cathedral. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but the hunchback is captured by Phoebus and his guards, who save Esmeralda.\nThe following day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be flogged and turned on the pillory for one hour, followed by another hour's public exposure. He calls for water. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, approaches the public stocks and offers him a drink of water. It saves him, and she captures his heart.\nLater, Esmeralda is arrested and charged with the attempted murder of Phoebus, whom Frollo actually attempted to kill in jealousy after seeing him trying to seduce Esmeralda. She is sentenced to death by hanging. As she is being led to the gallows, Quasimodo swings down by the bell rope of Notre Dame and carries her off to the cathedral under the law of sanctuary, temporarily protecting her from arrest.\nFrollo later informs Gringoire that the Court of Parlement has voted to remove Esmeralda's right to sanctuary so she can no longer seek shelter in the cathedral and will be taken away to be killed. Clopin, the leader of the Gypsies, hears the news from Gringoire and rallies the citizens of Paris to charge the cathedral and rescue Esmeralda.\nWhen Quasimodo sees the Gypsies, he assumes they are there to hurt Esmeralda, so he drives them off. Likewise, he thinks the King's men want to rescue her, and tries to help them find her. She is rescued by Frollo and her phony husband Gringoire. But after yet another failed attempt to win her love, Frollo betrays Esmeralda by handing her to the troops and watches while she is being hanged.\nWhen Frollo laughs during Esmeralda's hanging, Quasimodo pushes him from the heights of Notre Dame to his death. Quasimodo later goes to Montfaucon, a huge graveyard in Paris where the bodies of the condemned are dumped, where he stays with Esmeralda's dead body and dies of starvation. About eighteen months later, the tomb is opened, and the skeletons are found. As someone tries to separate them, they crumble to dust.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Notre-Dame de Paris, by Victor Hugo\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Hapgood\n\n\n\n\nPREFACE.\n\nA few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Notre-Dame,\nthe author of this book found, in an obscure nook of one of the towers,\nthe following word, engraved by hand upon the wall:--\n\n       _ANANKE_.\n\n\nThese Greek capitals, black with age, and quite deeply graven in\nthe stone, with I know not what signs peculiar to Gothic caligraphy\nimprinted upon their forms and upon their attitudes, as though with the\npurpose of revealing that it had been a hand of the Middle Ages which\nhad inscribed them there, and especially the fatal and melancholy\nmeaning contained in them, struck the author deeply.\n\nHe questioned himself; he sought to divine who could have been that soul\nin torment which had not been willing to quit this world without leaving\nthis stigma of crime or unhappiness upon the brow of the ancient church.\n\nAfterwards, the wall was whitewashed or scraped down, I know not which,\nand the inscription disappeared. For it is thus that people have been in\nthe habit of proceeding with the marvellous churches of the Middle Ages\nfor the last two hundred years. Mutilations come to them from every\nquarter, from within as well as from without. The priest whitewashes\nthem, the archdeacon scrapes them down; then the populace arrives and\ndemolishes them.\n\nThus, with the exception of the fragile memory which the author of this\nbook here consecrates to it, there remains to-day nothing whatever\nof the mysterious word engraved within the gloomy tower of\nNotre-Dame,--nothing of the destiny which it so sadly summed up. The\nman who wrote that word upon the wall disappeared from the midst of the\ngenerations of man many centuries ago; the word, in its turn, has been\neffaced from the wall of the church; the church will, perhaps, itself\nsoon disappear from the face of the earth.\n\nIt is upon this word that this book is founded.\n\nMarch, 1831.\n\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME I.\n\n     BOOK FIRST.\n\n     I.

THE GRAND HALL.\n\n\n\nThree hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago\nto-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple\ncircuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.\n\nThe sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has\npreserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which\nthus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early\nmorning. It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians,\nnor a hunt led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town\nof Laas, nor an entry of \"our much dread lord, monsieur the king,\" nor\neven a pretty hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris.\nNeither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of\nsome plumed and bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last\ncavalcade of that nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with\nconcluding the marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders,\nhad made its entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal\nde Bourbon, who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged\nto assume an amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish\nburgomasters, and to regale them at his H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Bourbon, with a very\n\"pretty morality, allegorical satire, and farce,\" while a driving rain\ndrenched the magnificent tapestries at his door.\n\nWhat put the \"whole population of Paris in commotion,\" as Jehan de\nTroyes expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity,\nunited from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools.\n\nOn that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, a maypole\nat the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. It\nhad been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at\nall the cross roads, by the provost's men, clad in handsome, short,\nsleeveless coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their\nbreasts.\n\nSo the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses\nand shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some\none of the three spots designated.\n\nEach had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole;\nanother, the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense\nof the loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed\ntheir steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards\nthe mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the\nPalais de Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled;\nand that the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver\nall alone beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of\nBraque.\n\nThe populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular,\nbecause they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days\npreviously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery,\nand at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take\nplace in the grand hall.\n\nIt was no easy matter on that day, to force one's way into that grand\nhall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure\nin the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall\nof the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people,\noffered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into\nwhich five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged\nevery moment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented\nincessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected\nhere and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of\nthe place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the palace, the\ngrand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current,\nwhich, after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad\nwaves along its lateral slopes,--the grand staircase, I say, trickled\nincessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the\nlaughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great\nnoise and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor\nredoubled; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase\nflowed backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced\nby the buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost's\nsergeants, which kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which\nthe provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to\nthe _mar\u00c3\u00a9chauss\u00c3\u00a9e_, the _mar\u00c3\u00a9chauss\u00c3\u00a9e_ to our _gendarmeri_ of Paris.\n\n\n     *  The word Gothic, in the sense in which it is generally employed,\nis wholly unsuitable, but wholly consecrated. Hence we accept it and\nwe adopt it, like all the rest of the world, to characterize the\narchitecture of the second half of the Middle Ages, where the ogive is\nthe principle which succeeds the architecture of the first period, of\nwhich the semi-circle is the father.\n\n\nThousands of good, calm, bourgeois faces thronged the windows, the\ndoors, the dormer windows, the roofs, gazing at the palace, gazing\nat the populace, and asking nothing more; for many Parisians content\nthemselves with the spectacle of the spectators, and a wall behind which\nsomething is going on becomes at once, for us, a very curious thing\nindeed.\n\nIf it could be granted to us, the men of 1830, to mingle in thought\nwith those Parisians of the fifteenth century, and to enter with them,\njostled, elbowed, pulled about, into that immense hall of the palace,\nwhich was so cramped on that sixth of January, 1482, the spectacle would\nnot be devoid of either interest or charm, and we should have about us\nonly things that were so old that they would seem new.\n\nWith the reader's consent, we will endeavor to retrace in thought,\nthe impression which he would have experienced in company with us\non crossing the threshold of that grand hall, in the midst of that\ntumultuous crowd in surcoats, short, sleeveless jackets, and doublets.\n\nAnd, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement in\nthe eyes. Above our heads is a double ogive vault, panelled with wood\ncarving, painted azure, and sown with golden fleurs-de-lis; beneath\nour feet a pavement of black and white marble, alternating. A few paces\ndistant, an enormous pillar, then another, then another; seven pillars\nin all, down the length of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches\nof the double vault, in the centre of its width. Around four of the\npillars, stalls of merchants, all sparkling with glass and tinsel;\naround the last three, benches of oak, worn and polished by the trunk\nhose of the litigants, and the robes of the attorneys. Around the hall,\nalong the lofty wall, between the doors, between the windows, between\nthe pillars, the interminable row of all the kings of France, from\nPharamond down: the lazy kings, with pendent arms and downcast eyes;\nthe valiant and combative kings, with heads and arms raised boldly\nheavenward. Then in the long, pointed windows, glass of a thousand hues;\nat the wide entrances to the hall, rich doors, finely sculptured; and\nall, the vaults, pillars, walls, jambs, panelling, doors, statues,\ncovered from top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumination,\nwhich, a trifle tarnished at the epoch when we behold it, had almost\nentirely disappeared beneath dust and spiders in the year of grace,\n1549, when du Breul still admired it from tradition.\n\nLet the reader picture to himself now, this immense, oblong hall,\nilluminated by the pallid light of a January day, invaded by a motley\nand noisy throng which drifts along the walls, and eddies round the\nseven pillars, and he will have a confused idea of the whole effect of\nthe picture, whose curious details we shall make an effort to indicate\nwith more precision.\n\nIt is certain, that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henri IV., there\nwould have been no documents in the trial of Ravaillac deposited in the\nclerk's office of the Palais de Justice, no accomplices interested in\ncausing the said documents to disappear; hence, no incendiaries obliged,\nfor lack of better means, to burn the clerk's office in order to burn\nthe documents, and to burn the Palais de Justice in order to burn the\nclerk's office; consequently, in short, no conflagration in 1618. The\nold Palais would be standing still, with its ancient grand hall; I\nshould be able to say to the reader, \"Go and look at it,\" and we should\nthus both escape the necessity,--I of making, and he of reading, a\ndescription of it, such as it is. Which demonstrates a new truth: that\ngreat events have incalculable results.\n\nIt is true that it may be quite possible, in the first place, that\nRavaillac had no accomplices; and in the second, that if he had any,\nthey were in no way connected with the fire of 1618. Two other very\nplausible explanations exist: First, the great flaming star, a foot\nbroad, and a cubit high, which fell from heaven, as every one knows,\nupon the law courts, after midnight on the seventh of March; second,\nTh\u00c3\u00a9ophile's quatrain,--\n\n\n    \"Sure, 'twas but a sorry game\n    When at Paris, Dame Justice,\n    Through having eaten too much spice,\n    Set the palace all aflame.\"\n\n\nWhatever may be thought of this triple explanation, political, physical,\nand poetical, of the burning of the law courts in 1618, the unfortunate\nfact of the fire is certain. Very little to-day remains, thanks to this\ncatastrophe,--thanks, above all, to the successive restorations which\nhave completed what it spared,--very little remains of that first\ndwelling of the kings of France,--of that elder palace of the Louvre,\nalready so old in the time of Philip the Handsome, that they sought\nthere for the traces of the magnificent buildings erected by King Robert\nand described by Helgaldus. Nearly everything has disappeared. What has\nbecome of the chamber of the chancellery, where Saint Louis consummated\nhis marriage? the garden where he administered justice, \"clad in a\ncoat of camelot, a surcoat of linsey-woolsey, without sleeves, and a\nsur-mantle of black sandal, as he lay upon the carpet with Joinville?\"\nWhere is the chamber of the Emperor Sigismond? and that of Charles IV.?\nthat of Jean the Landless? Where is the staircase, from which Charles\nVI. promulgated his edict of pardon? the slab where Marcel cut the\nthroats of Robert de Clermont and the Marshal of Champagne, in the\npresence of the dauphin? the wicket where the bulls of Pope Benedict\nwere torn, and whence those who had brought them departed decked out, in\nderision, in copes and mitres, and making an apology through all Paris?\nand the grand hall, with its gilding, its azure, its statues, its\npointed arches, its pillars, its immense vault, all fretted with\ncarvings? and the gilded chamber? and the stone lion, which stood at the\ndoor, with lowered head and tail between his legs, like the lions on the\nthrone of Solomon, in the humiliated attitude which befits force in the\npresence of justice? and the beautiful doors? and the stained glass?\nand the chased ironwork, which drove Biscornette to despair? and the\ndelicate woodwork of Hancy? What has time, what have men done with these\nmarvels? What have they given us in return for all this Gallic history,\nfor all this Gothic art? The heavy flattened arches of M. de Brosse,\nthat awkward architect of the Saint-Gervais portal. So much for art;\nand, as for history, we have the gossiping reminiscences of the great\npillar, still ringing with the tattle of the Patru.\n\nIt is not much. Let us return to the veritable grand hall of the\nveritable old palace. The two extremities of this gigantic parallelogram\nwere occupied, the one by the famous marble table, so long, so broad,\nand so thick that, as the ancient land rolls--in a style that would have\ngiven Gargantua an appetite--say, \"such a slice of marble as was never\nbeheld in the world\"; the other by the chapel where Louis XI. had\nhimself sculptured on his knees before the Virgin, and whither he caused\nto be brought, without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of\nroyal statues, the statues of Charlemagne and of Saint Louis, two saints\nwhom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven, as kings of France.\nThis chapel, quite new, having been built only six years, was entirely\nin that charming taste of delicate architecture, of marvellous\nsculpture, of fine and deep chasing, which marks with us the end of\nthe Gothic era, and which is perpetuated to about the middle of the\nsixteenth century in the fairylike fancies of the Renaissance. The\nlittle open-work rose window, pierced above the portal, was, in\nparticular, a masterpiece of lightness and grace; one would have\npronounced it a star of lace.\n\nIn the middle of the hall, opposite the great door, a platform of gold\nbrocade, placed against the wall, a special entrance to which had been\neffected through a window in the corridor of the gold chamber, had\nbeen erected for the Flemish emissaries and the other great personages\ninvited to the presentation of the mystery play.\n\nIt was upon the marble table that the mystery was to be enacted, as\nusual. It had been arranged for the purpose, early in the morning;\nits rich slabs of marble, all scratched by the heels of law clerks,\nsupported a cage of carpenter's work of considerable height, the upper\nsurface of which, within view of the whole hall, was to serve as the\ntheatre, and whose interior, masked by tapestries, was to take the place\nof dressing-rooms for the personages of the piece. A ladder, naively\nplaced on the outside, was to serve as means of communication between\nthe dressing-room and the stage, and lend its rude rungs to entrances as\nwell as to exits. There was no personage, however unexpected, no sudden\nchange, no theatrical effect, which was not obliged to mount that\nladder. Innocent and venerable infancy of art and contrivances!\n\nFour of the bailiff of the palace's sergeants, perfunctory guardians of\nall the pleasures of the people, on days of festival as well as on days\nof execution, stood at the four corners of the marble table.\n\nThe piece was only to begin with the twelfth stroke of the great palace\nclock sounding midday. It was very late, no doubt, for a theatrical\nrepresentation, but they had been obliged to fix the hour to suit the\nconvenience of the ambassadors.\n\nNow, this whole multitude had been waiting since morning. A goodly\nnumber of curious, good people had been shivering since daybreak before\nthe grand staircase of the palace; some even affirmed that they had\npassed the night across the threshold of the great door, in order to\nmake sure that they should be the first to pass in. The crowd grew more\ndense every moment, and, like water, which rises above its normal level,\nbegan to mount along the walls, to swell around the pillars, to spread\nout on the entablatures, on the cornices, on the window-sills, on\nall the salient points of the architecture, on all the reliefs of the\nsculpture. Hence, discomfort, impatience, weariness, the liberty of a\nday of cynicism and folly, the quarrels which break forth for all sorts\nof causes--a pointed elbow, an iron-shod shoe, the fatigue of long\nwaiting--had already, long before the hour appointed for the arrival\nof the ambassadors, imparted a harsh and bitter accent to the clamor of\nthese people who were shut in, fitted into each other, pressed, trampled\nupon, stifled. Nothing was to be heard but imprecations on the Flemish,\nthe provost of the merchants, the Cardinal de Bourbon, the bailiff of\nthe courts, Madame Marguerite of Austria, the sergeants with their rods,\nthe cold, the heat, the bad weather, the Bishop of Paris, the Pope of\nthe Fools, the pillars, the statues, that closed door, that open window;\nall to the vast amusement of a band of scholars and lackeys scattered\nthrough the mass, who mingled with all this discontent their teasing\nremarks, and their malicious suggestions, and pricked the general bad\ntemper with a pin, so to speak.\n\nAmong the rest there was a group of those merry imps, who, after\nsmashing the glass in a window, had seated themselves hardily on\nthe entablature, and from that point despatched their gaze and their\nrailleries both within and without, upon the throng in the hall, and the\nthrong upon the Place. It was easy to see, from their parodied gestures,\ntheir ringing laughter, the bantering appeals which they exchanged with\ntheir comrades, from one end of the hall to the other, that these\nyoung clerks did not share the weariness and fatigue of the rest of the\nspectators, and that they understood very well the art of extracting,\nfor their own private diversion from that which they had under their\neyes, a spectacle which made them await the other with patience.\n\n\"Upon my soul, so it's you, 'Joannes Frollo de Molendino!'\" cried one\nof them, to a sort of little, light-haired imp, with a well-favored and\nmalign countenance, clinging to the acanthus leaves of a capital; \"you\nare well named John of the Mill, for your two arms and your two legs\nhave the air of four wings fluttering on the breeze. How long have you\nbeen here?\"\n\n\"By the mercy of the devil,\" retorted Joannes Frollo, \"these four\nhours and more; and I hope that they will be reckoned to my credit in\npurgatory. I heard the eight singers of the King of Sicily intone the\nfirst verse of seven o'clock mass in the Sainte-Chapelle.\"\n\n\"Fine singers!\" replied the other, \"with voices even more pointed than\ntheir caps! Before founding a mass for Monsieur Saint John, the king\nshould have inquired whether Monsieur Saint John likes Latin droned out\nin a Proven\u00c3\u00a7al accent.\"\n\n\"He did it for the sake of employing those accursed singers of the King\nof Sicily!\" cried an old woman sharply from among the crowd beneath the\nwindow. \"I just put it to you! A thousand _livres parisi_ for a mass!\nand out of the tax on sea fish in the markets of Paris, to boot!\"\n\n\"Peace, old crone,\" said a tall, grave person, stopping up his nose on\nthe side towards the fishwife; \"a mass had to be founded. Would you wish\nthe king to fall ill again?\"\n\n\"Bravely spoken, Sire Gilles Lecornu, master furrier of king's robes!\"\ncried the little student, clinging to the capital.\n\nA shout of laughter from all the students greeted the unlucky name of\nthe poor furrier of the king's robes.\n\n\"Lecornu! Gilles Lecornu!\" said some.\n\n\"_Cornutus et hirsutus_, horned and hairy,\" another went on.\n\n\"He! of course,\" continued the small imp on the capital, \"What are they\nlaughing at? An honorable man is Gilles Lecornu, brother of Master Jehan\nLecornu, provost of the king's house, son of Master Mahiet Lecornu,\nfirst porter of the Bois de Vincennes,--all bourgeois of Paris, all\nmarried, from father to son.\"\n\nThe gayety redoubled. The big furrier, without uttering a word in reply,\ntried to escape all the eyes riveted upon him from all sides; but\nhe perspired and panted in vain; like a wedge entering the wood, his\nefforts served only to bury still more deeply in the shoulders of his\nneighbors, his large, apoplectic face, purple with spite and rage.\n\nAt length one of these, as fat, short, and venerable as himself, came to\nhis rescue.\n\n\"Abomination! scholars addressing a bourgeois in that fashion in my day\nwould have been flogged with a fagot, which would have afterwards been\nused to burn them.\"\n\nThe whole band burst into laughter.\n\n\"Hol\u00c3\u00a0 h\u00c3\u00a9! who is scolding so? Who is that screech owl of evil fortune?\"\n\n\"Hold, I know him\" said one of them; \"'tis Master Andry Musnier.\"\n\n\"Because he is one of the four sworn booksellers of the university!\"\nsaid the other.\n\n\"Everything goes by fours in that shop,\" cried a third; \"the four\nnations, the four faculties, the four feasts, the four procurators, the\nfour electors, the four booksellers.\"\n\n\"Well,\" began Jean Frollo once more, \"we must play the devil with\nthem.\"*\n\n\n     *  _Faire le diable a quatre_.\n\n\n\"Musnier, we'll burn your books.\"\n\n\"Musnier, we'll beat your lackeys.\"\n\n\"Musnier, we'll kiss your wife.\"\n\n\"That fine, big Mademoiselle Oudarde.\"\n\n\"Who is as fresh and as gay as though she were a widow.\"\n\n\"Devil take you!\" growled Master Andry Musnier.\n\n\"Master Andry,\" pursued Jean Jehan, still clinging to his capital, \"hold\nyour tongue, or I'll drop on your head!\"\n\nMaster Andry raised his eyes, seemed to measure in an instant the height\nof the pillar, the weight of the scamp, mentally multiplied that weight\nby the square of the velocity and remained silent.\n\nJehan, master of the field of battle, pursued triumphantly:\n\n\"That's what I'll do, even if I am the brother of an archdeacon!\"\n\n\"Fine gentry are our people of the university, not to have caused our\nprivileges to be respected on such a day as this! However, there is a\nmaypole and a bonfire in the town; a mystery, Pope of the Fools, and\nFlemish ambassadors in the city; and, at the university, nothing!\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, the Place Maubert is sufficiently large!\" interposed one\nof the clerks established on the window-sill.\n\n\"Down with the rector, the electors, and the procurators!\" cried\nJoannes.\n\n\"We must have a bonfire this evening in the Champ-Gaillard,\" went on the\nother, \"made of Master Andry's books.\"\n\n\"And the desks of the scribes!\" added his neighbor.\n\n\"And the beadles' wands!\"\n\n\"And the spittoons of the deans!\"\n\n\"And the cupboards of the procurators!\"\n\n\"And the hutches of the electors!\"\n\n\"And the stools of the rector!\"\n\n\"Down with them!\" put in little Jehan, as counterpoint; \"down with\nMaster Andry, the beadles and the scribes; the theologians, the doctors\nand the decretists; the procurators, the electors and the rector!\"\n\n\"The end of the world has come!,' muttered Master Andry, stopping up his\nears.\n\n\"By the way, there's the rector! see, he is passing through the Place,\"\ncried one of those in the window.\n\nEach rivalled his neighbor in his haste to turn towards the Place.\n\n\"Is it really our venerable rector, Master Thibaut?\" demanded Jehan\nFrollo du Moulin, who, as he was clinging to one of the inner pillars,\ncould not see what was going on outside.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" replied all the others, \"it is really he, Master Thibaut,\nthe rector.\"\n\nIt was, in fact, the rector and all the dignitaries of the university,\nwho were marching in procession in front of the embassy, and at that\nmoment traversing the Place. The students crowded into the window,\nsaluted them as they passed with sarcasms and ironical applause. The\nrector, who was walking at the head of his company, had to support the\nfirst broadside; it was severe.\n\n\"Good day, monsieur le recteur! Hol\u00c3\u00a0 h\u00c3\u00a9! good day there!\"\n\n\"How does he manage to be here, the old gambler?

No one has ever\nbeheld such outbreaks among the students! It is the accursed inventions\nof this century that are ruining everything,--artilleries, bombards,\nand, above all, printing, that other German pest. No more manuscripts,\nno more books! printing will kill bookselling. It is the end of the\nworld that is drawing nigh.\"\n\n\"I see that plainly, from the progress of velvet stuffs,\" said the\nfur-merchant.\n\nAt this moment, midday sounded.\n\n\"Ha!\" exclaimed the entire crowd, in one voice.\n\nThe scholars held their peace. Then a great hurly-burly ensued; a vast\nmovement of feet, hands, and heads; a general outbreak of coughs and\nhandkerchiefs; each one arranged himself, assumed his post, raised\nhimself up, and grouped himself. Then came a great silence; all necks\nremained outstretched, all mouths remained open, all glances were\ndirected towards the marble table. Nothing made its appearance there.\nThe bailiff's four sergeants were still there, stiff, motionless, as\npainted statues. All eyes turned to the estrade reserved for the Flemish\nenvoys. The door remained closed, the platform empty. This crowd had\nbeen waiting since daybreak for three things: noonday, the embassy from\nFlanders, the mystery play. Noonday alone had arrived on time.\n\nOn this occasion, it was too much.\n\nThey waited one, two, three, five minutes, a quarter of an hour; nothing\ncame. The dais remained empty, the theatre dumb. In the meantime, wrath\nhad succeeded to impatience. Irritated words circulated in a low tone,\nstill, it is true. \"The mystery! the mystery!\" they murmured, in hollow\nvoices. Heads began to ferment. A tempest, which was only rumbling in\nthe distance as yet, was floating on the surface of this crowd. It was\nJehan du Moulin who struck the first spark from it.\n\n\"The mystery, and to the devil with the Flemings!\" he exclaimed at the\nfull force of his lungs, twining like a serpent around his pillar.\n\nThe crowd clapped their hands.\n\n\"The mystery!\" it repeated, \"and may all the devils take Flanders!\"\n\n\"We must have the mystery instantly,\" resumed the student; \"or else,\nmy advice is that we should hang the bailiff of the courts, by way of a\nmorality and a comedy.\"\n\n\"Well said,\" cried the people, \"and let us begin the hanging with his\nsergeants.\"\n\nA grand acclamation followed. The four poor fellows began to turn pale,\nand to exchange glances. The crowd hurled itself towards them, and they\nalready beheld the frail wooden railing, which separated them from it,\ngiving way and bending before the pressure of the throng.\n\nIt was a critical moment.\n\n\"To the sack, to the sack!\" rose the cry on all sides.\n\nAt that moment, the tapestry of the dressing-room, which we have\ndescribed above, was raised, and afforded passage to a personage, the\nmere sight of whom suddenly stopped the crowd, and changed its wrath\ninto curiosity as by enchantment.\n\n\"Silence! silence!\"\n\nThe personage, but little reassured, and trembling in every limb,\nadvanced to the edge of the marble table with a vast amount of bows,\nwhich, in proportion as he drew nearer, more and more resembled\ngenuflections.\n\nIn the meanwhile, tranquillity had gradually been restored. All that\nremained was that slight murmur which always rises above the silence of\na crowd.\n\n\"Messieurs the bourgeois,\" said he, \"and mesdemoiselles the\n_bourgeoises_, we shall have the honor of declaiming and representing,\nbefore his eminence, monsieur the cardinal, a very beautiful morality\nwhich has for its title, 'The Good Judgment of Madame the Virgin Mary.'\nI am to play Jupiter. His eminence is, at this moment, escorting the\nvery honorable embassy of the Duke of Austria; which is detained,\nat present, listening to the harangue of monsieur the rector of the\nuniversity, at the gate Baudets. As soon as his illustrious eminence,\nthe cardinal, arrives, we will begin.\"\n\nIt is certain, that nothing less than the intervention of Jupiter was\nrequired to save the four unfortunate sergeants of the bailiff of the\ncourts. If we had the happiness of having invented this very veracious\ntale, and of being, in consequence, responsible for it before our Lady\nCriticism, it is not against us that the classic precept, _Nec deus\nintersit_, could be invoked. Moreover, the costume of Seigneur Jupiter,\nwas very handsome, and contributed not a little towards calming the\ncrowd, by attracting all its attention. Jupiter was clad in a coat of\nmail, covered with black velvet, with gilt nails; and had it not been\nfor the rouge, and the huge red beard, each of which covered one-half of\nhis face,--had it not been for the roll of gilded cardboard, spangled,\nand all bristling with strips of tinsel, which he held in his hand, and\nin which the eyes of the initiated easily recognized thunderbolts,--had\nnot his feet been flesh-colored, and banded with ribbons in Greek\nfashion, he might have borne comparison, so far as the severity of his\nmien was concerned, with a Breton archer from the guard of Monsieur de\nBerry.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. PIERRE GRINGOIRE.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration\nunanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and\nwhen he reached that untoward conclusion: \"As soon as his illustrious\neminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,\" his voice was drowned\nin a thunder of hooting.\n\n\"Begin instantly! The mystery! the mystery immediately!\" shrieked the\npeople. And above all the voices, that of Johannes de Molendino\nwas audible, piercing the uproar like the fife's derisive serenade:\n\"Commence instantly!\" yelped the scholar.\n\n\"Down with Jupiter and the Cardinal de Bourbon!\" vociferated Robin\nPoussepain and the other clerks perched in the window.\n\n\"The morality this very instant!\" repeated the crowd; \"this very\ninstant! the sack and the rope for the comedians, and the cardinal!\"\n\nPoor Jupiter, haggard, frightened, pale beneath his rouge, dropped his\nthunderbolt, took his cap in his hand; then he bowed and trembled\nand stammered: \"His eminence--the ambassadors--Madame Marguerite of\nFlanders--.\" He did not know what to say. In truth, he was afraid of\nbeing hung.\n\nHung by the populace for waiting, hung by the cardinal for not having\nwaited, he saw between the two dilemmas only an abyss; that is to say, a\ngallows.\n\nLuckily, some one came to rescue him from his embarrassment, and assume\nthe responsibility.\n\nAn individual who was standing beyond the railing, in the free space\naround the marble table, and whom no one had yet caught sight of, since\nhis long, thin body was completely sheltered from every visual ray\nby the diameter of the pillar against which he was leaning; this\nindividual, we say, tall, gaunt, pallid, blond, still young, although\nalready wrinkled about the brow and cheeks, with brilliant eyes and a\nsmiling mouth, clad in garments of black serge, worn and shining with\nage, approached the marble table, and made a sign to the poor sufferer.\nBut the other was so confused that he did not see him. The new comer\nadvanced another step.\n\n\"Jupiter,\" said he, \"my dear Jupiter!\"\n\nThe other did not hear.\n\nAt last, the tall blond, driven out of patience, shrieked almost in his\nface,--\n\n\"Michel Giborne!\"\n\n\"Who calls me?\" said Jupiter, as though awakened with a start.\n\n\"I,\" replied the person clad in black.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Jupiter.\n\n\"Begin at once,\" went on the other. \"Satisfy the populace; I undertake\nto appease the bailiff, who will appease monsieur the cardinal.\"\n\nJupiter breathed once more.\n\n\"Messeigneurs the bourgeois,\" he cried, at the top of his lungs to the\ncrowd, which continued to hoot him, \"we are going to begin at once.\"\n\n\"_Evoe Jupiter! Plaudite cives_! All hail, Jupiter! Applaud, citizens!\"\nshouted the scholars.\n\n\"Noel! Noel! good, good,\" shouted the people.\n\nThe hand clapping was deafening, and Jupiter had already withdrawn under\nhis tapestry, while the hall still trembled with acclamations.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the personage who had so magically turned the tempest\ninto dead calm, as our old and dear Corneille puts it, had modestly\nretreated to the half-shadow of his pillar, and would, no doubt, have\nremained invisible there, motionless, and mute as before, had he not\nbeen plucked by the sleeve by two young women, who, standing in the\nfront row of the spectators, had noticed his colloquy with Michel\nGiborne-Jupiter.\n\n\"Master,\" said one of them, making him a sign to approach. \"Hold your\ntongue, my dear Li\u00c3\u00a9narde,\" said her neighbor, pretty, fresh, and very\nbrave, in consequence of being dressed up in her best attire. \"He is not\na clerk, he is a layman; you must not say master to him, but messire.\"\n\n\"Messire,\" said Li\u00c3\u00a9narde.\n\nThe stranger approached the railing.\n\n\"What would you have of me, damsels?\" he asked, with alacrity.\n\n\"Oh! nothing,\" replied Li\u00c3\u00a9narde, in great confusion; \"it is my neighbor,\nGisquette la Gencienne, who wishes to speak with you.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" replied Gisquette, blushing; \"it was Li\u00c3\u00a9narde who called you\nmaster; I only told her to say messire.\"\n\nThe two young girls dropped their eyes. The man, who asked nothing\nbetter than to enter into conversation, looked at them with a smile.\n\n\"So you have nothing to say to me, damsels?\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing at all,\" replied Gisquette.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Li\u00c3\u00a9narde.\n\nThe tall, light-haired young man retreated a step; but the two curious\nmaidens had no mind to let slip their prize.\n\n\"Messire,\" said Gisquette, with the impetuosity of an open sluice, or\nof a woman who has made up her mind, \"do you know that soldier who is to\nplay the part of Madame the Virgin in the mystery?\"\n\n\"You mean the part of Jupiter?\" replied the stranger.\n\n\"H\u00c3\u00a9! yes,\" said Li\u00c3\u00a9narde, \"isn't she stupid? So you know Jupiter?\"\n\n\"Michel Giborne?\" replied the unknown; \"yes, madam.\"\n\n\"He has a fine beard!\" said Li\u00c3\u00a9narde.\n\n\"Will what they are about to say here be fine?\" inquired Gisquette,\ntimidly.\n\n\"Very fine, mademoiselle,\" replied the unknown, without the slightest\nhesitation.\n\n\"What is it to be?\" said Li\u00c3\u00a9narde.\n\n\"'The Good Judgment of Madame the Virgin,'--a morality, if you please,\ndamsel.\"\n\n\"Ah! that makes a difference,\" responded Li\u00c3\u00a9narde.\n\nA brief silence ensued--broken by the stranger.\n\n\"It is a perfectly new morality, and one which has never yet been\nplayed.\"\n\n\"Then it is not the same one,\" said Gisquette, \"that was given two years\nago, on the day of the entrance of monsieur the legate, and where three\nhandsome maids played the parts--\"\n\n\"Of sirens,\" said Li\u00c3\u00a9narde.\n\n\"And all naked,\" added the young man.\n\nLi\u00c3\u00a9narde lowered her eyes modestly. Gisquette glanced at her and did the\nsame. He continued, with a smile,--\n\n\"It was a very pleasant thing to see. To-day it is a morality made\nexpressly for Madame the Demoiselle of Flanders.\"\n\n\"Will they sing shepherd songs?\" inquired Gisquette.\n\n\"Fie!\" said the stranger, \"in a morality? you must not confound styles.\nIf it were a farce, well and good.\"\n\n\"That is a pity,\" resumed Gisquette. \"That day, at the Ponceau Fountain,\nthere were wild men and women, who fought and assumed many aspects, as\nthey sang little motets and bergerettes.\"\n\n\"That which is suitable for a legate,\" returned the stranger, with a\ngood deal of dryness, \"is not suitable for a princess.\"\n\n\"And beside them,\" resumed Li\u00c3\u00a9narde, \"played many brass instruments,\nmaking great melodies.\"\n\n\"And for the refreshment of the passers-by,\" continued Gisquette, \"the\nfountain spouted through three mouths, wine, milk, and hippocrass, of\nwhich every one drank who wished.\"\n\n\"And a little below the Ponceau, at the Trinity,\" pursued Li\u00c3\u00a9narde,\n\"there was a passion performed, and without any speaking.\"\n\n\"How well I remember that!\" exclaimed Gisquette; \"God on the cross,\nand the two thieves on the right and the left.\" Here the young gossips,\ngrowing warm at the memory of the entrance of monsieur the legate, both\nbegan to talk at once.\n\n\"And, further on, at the Painters' Gate, there were other personages,\nvery richly clad.\"\n\n\"And at the fountain of Saint-Innocent, that huntsman, who was chasing a\nhind with great clamor of dogs and hunting-horns.\"\n\n\"And, at the Paris slaughter-houses, stages, representing the fortress\nof Dieppe!\"\n\n\"And when the legate passed, you remember, Gisquette? they made the\nassault, and the English all had their throats cut.\"\n\n\"And against the gate of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, there were very fine personages!\"\n\n\"And on the Port au Change, which was all draped above!\"\n\n\"And when the legate passed, they let fly on the bridge more than two\nhundred sorts of birds; wasn't it beautiful, Li\u00c3\u00a9narde?\"\n\n\"It will be better to-day,\" finally resumed their interlocutor, who\nseemed to listen to them with impatience.\n\n\"Do you promise us that this mystery will be fine?\" said Gisquette.\n\n\"Without doubt,\" he replied; then he added, with a certain emphasis,--\"I\nam the author of it, damsels.\"\n\n\"Truly?\" said the young girls, quite taken aback.\n\n\"Truly!\" replied the poet, bridling a little; \"that is, to say, there\nare two of us; Jehan Marchand, who has sawed the planks and erected\nthe framework of the theatre and the woodwork; and I, who have made the\npiece. My name is Pierre Gringoire.\"\n\nThe author of the \"Cid\" could not have said \"Pierre Corneille\" with more\npride.\n\nOur readers have been able to observe, that a certain amount of time\nmust have already elapsed from the moment when Jupiter had retired\nbeneath the tapestry to the instant when the author of the new morality\nhad thus abruptly revealed himself to the innocent admiration of\nGisquette and Li\u00c3\u00a9narde. Remarkable fact: that whole crowd, so tumultuous\nbut a few moments before, now waited amiably on the word of the\ncomedian; which proves the eternal truth, still experienced every day in\nour theatres, that the best means of making the public wait patiently is\nto assure them that one is about to begin instantly.\n\nHowever, scholar Johannes had not fallen asleep.\n\n\"Hol\u00c3\u00a0 h\u00c3\u00a9!\" he shouted suddenly, in the midst of the peaceable waiting\nwhich had followed the tumult. \"Jupiter, Madame the Virgin, buffoons of\nthe devil! are you jeering at us? The piece! the piece! commence or we\nwill commence again!\"\n\nThis was all that was needed.\n\nThe music of high and low instruments immediately became audible from\nthe interior of the stage; the tapestry was raised; four personages,\nin motley attire and painted faces, emerged from it, climbed the steep\nladder of the theatre, and, arrived upon the upper platform, arranged\nthemselves in a line before the public, whom they saluted with profound\nreverences; then the symphony ceased.\n\nThe mystery was about to begin.\n\nThe four personages, after having reaped a rich reward of applause for\ntheir reverences, began, in the midst of profound silence, a prologue,\nwhich we gladly spare the reader. Moreover, as happens in our own day,\nthe public was more occupied with the costumes that the actors wore than\nwith the roles that they were enacting; and, in truth, they were right.\nAll four were dressed in parti-colored robes of yellow and white, which\nwere distinguished from each other only by the nature of the stuff; the\nfirst was of gold and silver brocade; the second, of silk; the third, of\nwool; the fourth, of linen. The first of these personages carried in his\nright hand a sword; the second, two golden keys; the third, a pair of\nscales; the fourth, a spade: and, in order to aid sluggish minds\nwhich would not have seen clearly through the transparency of these\nattributes, there was to be read, in large, black letters, on the hem of\nthe robe of brocade, MY NAME IS NOBILITY; on the hem of the silken\nrobe, MY NAME IS CLERGY; on the hem of the woolen robe, MY NAME IS\nMERCHANDISE; on the hem of the linen robe, MY NAME IS LABOR. The sex\nof the two male characters was briefly indicated to every judicious\nspectator, by their shorter robes, and by the cap which they wore on\ntheir heads; while the two female characters, less briefly clad, were\ncovered with hoods.\n\nMuch ill-will would also have been required, not to comprehend, through\nthe medium of the poetry of the prologue, that Labor was wedded to\nMerchandise, and Clergy to Nobility, and that the two happy couples\npossessed in common a magnificent golden dolphin, which they desired\nto adjudge to the fairest only. So they were roaming about the world\nseeking and searching for this beauty, and, after having successively\nrejected the Queen of Golconda, the Princess of Trebizonde, the daughter\nof the Grand Khan of Tartary, etc., Labor and Clergy, Nobility and\nMerchandise, had come to rest upon the marble table of the Palais de\nJustice, and to utter, in the presence of the honest audience, as many\nsentences and maxims as could then be dispensed at the Faculty of Arts,\nat examinations, sophisms, determinances, figures, and acts, where the\nmasters took their degrees.\n\nAll this was, in fact, very fine.\n\nNevertheless, in that throng, upon which the four allegories vied with\neach other in pouring out floods of metaphors, there was no ear more\nattentive, no heart that palpitated more, not an eye was more haggard,\nno neck more outstretched, than the eye, the ear, the neck, and the\nheart of the author, of the poet, of that brave Pierre Gringoire, who\nhad not been able to resist, a moment before, the joy of telling his\nname to two pretty girls. He had retreated a few paces from them, behind\nhis pillar, and there he listened, looked, enjoyed. The amiable applause\nwhich had greeted the beginning of his prologue was still echoing in\nhis bosom, and he was completely absorbed in that species of ecstatic\ncontemplation with which an author beholds his ideas fall, one by one,\nfrom the mouth of the actor into the vast silence of the audience.\nWorthy Pierre Gringoire!\n\nIt pains us to say it, but this first ecstasy was speedily disturbed.\nHardly had Gringoire raised this intoxicating cup of joy and triumph to\nhis lips, when a drop of bitterness was mingled with it.\n\nA tattered mendicant, who could not collect any coins, lost as he was\nin the midst of the crowd, and who had not probably found sufficient\nindemnity in the pockets of his neighbors, had hit upon the idea of\nperching himself upon some conspicuous point, in order to attract looks\nand alms. He had, accordingly, hoisted himself, during the first verses\nof the prologue, with the aid of the pillars of the reserve gallery, to\nthe cornice which ran round the balustrade at its lower edge; and there\nhe had seated himself, soliciting the attention and the pity of the\nmultitude, with his rags and a hideous sore which covered his right arm.\nHowever, he uttered not a word.\n\nThe silence which he preserved allowed the prologue to proceed without\nhindrance, and no perceptible disorder would have ensued, if ill-luck\nhad not willed that the scholar Joannes should catch sight, from the\nheights of his pillar, of the mendicant and his grimaces. A wild fit of\nlaughter took possession of the young scamp, who, without caring that he\nwas interrupting the spectacle, and disturbing the universal composure,\nshouted boldly,--\n\n\"Look! see that sickly creature asking alms!\"\n\nAny one who has thrown a stone into a frog pond, or fired a shot into\na covey of birds, can form an idea of the effect produced by these\nincongruous words, in the midst of the general attention. It made\nGringoire shudder as though it had been an electric shock. The prologue\nstopped short, and all heads turned tumultuously towards the beggar,\nwho, far from being disconcerted by this, saw, in this incident, a good\nopportunity for reaping his harvest, and who began to whine in a doleful\nway, half closing his eyes the while,--\"Charity, please!\"\n\n\"Well--upon my soul,\" resumed Joannes, \"it's Clopin Trouillefou! Hol\u00c3\u00a0\nhe, my friend, did your sore bother you on the leg, that you have\ntransferred it to your arm?\" So saying, with the dexterity of a monkey,\nhe flung a bit of silver into the gray felt hat which the beggar held\nin his ailing arm. The mendicant received both the alms and the sarcasm\nwithout wincing, and continued, in lamentable tones,--\n\n\"Charity, please!\"\n\nThis episode considerably distracted the attention of the audience; and\na goodly number of spectators, among them Robin Poussepain, and all the\nclerks at their head, gayly applauded this eccentric duet, which the\nscholar, with his shrill voice, and the mendicant had just improvised in\nthe middle of the prologue.\n\nGringoire was highly displeased. On recovering from his first\nstupefaction, he bestirred himself to shout, to the four personages on\nthe stage, \"Go on! What the devil!--go on!\"--without even deigning to\ncast a glance of disdain upon the two interrupters.\n\nAt that moment, he felt some one pluck at the hem of his surtout;\nhe turned round, and not without ill-humor, and found considerable\ndifficulty in smiling; but he was obliged to do so, nevertheless. It\nwas the pretty arm of Gisquette la Gencienne, which, passed through the\nrailing, was soliciting his attention in this manner.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the young girl, \"are they going to continue?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied Gringoire, a good deal shocked by the question.\n\n\"In that case, messire,\" she resumed, \"would you have the courtesy to\nexplain to me--\"\n\n\"What they are about to say?\" interrupted Gringoire. \"Well, listen.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gisquette, \"but what they have said so far.\"\n\nGringoire started, like a man whose wound has been probed to the quick.\n\n\"A plague on the stupid and dull-witted little girl!\" he muttered,\nbetween his teeth.\n\nFrom that moment forth, Gisquette was nothing to him.\n\nIn the meantime, the actors had obeyed his injunction, and the public,\nseeing that they were beginning to speak again, began once more to\nlisten, not without having lost many beauties in the sort of soldered\njoint which was formed between the two portions of the piece thus\nabruptly cut short. Gringoire commented on it bitterly to himself.\nNevertheless, tranquillity was gradually restored, the scholar held his\npeace, the mendicant counted over some coins in his hat, and the piece\nresumed the upper hand.\n\nIt was, in fact, a very fine work, and one which, as it seems to us,\nmight be put to use to-day, by the aid of a little rearrangement. The\nexposition, rather long and rather empty, that is to say, according to\nthe rules, was simple; and Gringoire, in the candid sanctuary of his own\nconscience, admired its clearness. As the reader may surmise, the four\nallegorical personages were somewhat weary with having traversed the\nthree sections of the world, without having found suitable opportunity\nfor getting rid of their golden dolphin. Thereupon a eulogy of the\nmarvellous fish, with a thousand delicate allusions to the young\nbetrothed of Marguerite of Flanders, then sadly cloistered in at\nAmboise, and without a suspicion that Labor and Clergy, Nobility and\nMerchandise had just made the circuit of the world in his behalf. The\nsaid dauphin was then young, was handsome, was stout, and, above all\n(magnificent origin of all royal virtues), he was the son of the Lion\nof France. I declare that this bold metaphor is admirable, and that the\nnatural history of the theatre, on a day of allegory and royal marriage\nsongs, is not in the least startled by a dolphin who is the son of a\nlion. It is precisely these rare and Pindaric mixtures which prove the\npoet's enthusiasm. Nevertheless, in order to play the part of critic\nalso, the poet might have developed this beautiful idea in something\nless than two hundred lines. It is true that the mystery was to last\nfrom noon until four o'clock, in accordance with the orders of monsieur\nthe provost, and that it was necessary to say something. Besides, the\npeople listened patiently.\n\nAll at once, in the very middle of a quarrel between Mademoiselle\nMerchandise and Madame Nobility, at the moment when Monsieur Labor was\ngiving utterance to this wonderful line,--\n\n    In forest ne'er was seen a more triumphant beast;\n\nthe door of the reserved gallery which had hitherto remained so\ninopportunely closed, opened still more inopportunely; and the ringing\nvoice of the usher announced abruptly, \"His eminence, Monseigneur the\nCardinal de Bourbon.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. MONSIEUR THE CARDINAL.\n\n\n\nPoor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the\nSaint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the\ndetonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which,\nduring the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September,\n1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the\npowder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less\nrudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which\nfell from the lips of the usher, \"His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal\nde Bourbon.\"\n\nIt is not that Pierre Gringoire either feared or disdained monsieur the\ncardinal. He had neither the weakness nor the audacity for that. A true\neclectic, as it would be expressed nowadays, Gringoire was one of those\nfirm and lofty, moderate and calm spirits, which always know how to bear\nthemselves amid all circumstances (_stare in dimidio rerum_), and who\nare full of reason and of liberal philosophy, while still setting\nstore by cardinals. A rare, precious, and never interrupted race of\nphilosophers to whom wisdom, like another Ariadne, seems to have given\na clew of thread which they have been walking along unwinding since\nthe beginning of the world, through the labyrinth of human affairs. One\nfinds them in all ages, ever the same; that is to say, always according\nto all times. And, without reckoning our Pierre Gringoire, who may\nrepresent them in the fifteenth century if we succeed in bestowing upon\nhim the distinction which he deserves, it certainly was their spirit\nwhich animated Father du Breul, when he wrote, in the sixteenth, these\nnaively sublime words, worthy of all centuries: \"I am a Parisian by\nnation, and a Parrhisian in language, for _parrhisia_ in Greek signifies\nliberty of speech; of which I have made use even towards messeigneurs\nthe cardinals, uncle and brother to Monsieur the Prince de Conty, always\nwith respect to their greatness, and without offending any one of their\nsuite, which is much to say.\"\n\nThere was then neither hatred for the cardinal, nor disdain for his\npresence, in the disagreeable impression produced upon Pierre Gringoire.\nQuite the contrary; our poet had too much good sense and too threadbare\na coat, not to attach particular importance to having the numerous\nallusions in his prologue, and, in particular, the glorification of the\ndauphin, son of the Lion of France, fall upon the most eminent ear. But\nit is not interest which predominates in the noble nature of poets. I\nsuppose that the entity of the poet may be represented by the number\nten; it is certain that a chemist on analyzing and pharmacopolizing it,\nas Rabelais says, would find it composed of one part interest to nine\nparts of self-esteem.\n\nNow, at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal, the\nnine parts of self-esteem in Gringoire, swollen and expanded by\nthe breath of popular admiration, were in a state of prodigious\naugmentation, beneath which disappeared, as though stifled, that\nimperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the\nconstitution of poets; a precious ingredient, by the way, a ballast\nof reality and humanity, without which they would not touch the earth.\nGringoire enjoyed seeing, feeling, fingering, so to speak an entire\nassembly (of knaves, it is true, but what matters that?) stupefied,\npetrified, and as though asphyxiated in the presence of the\nincommensurable tirades which welled up every instant from all parts\nof his bridal song. I affirm that he shared the general beatitude, and\nthat, quite the reverse of La Fontaine, who, at the presentation of his\ncomedy of the \"Florentine,\" asked, \"Who is the ill-bred lout who made\nthat rhapsody?\" Gringoire would gladly have inquired of his neighbor,\n\"Whose masterpiece is this?\"\n\nThe reader can now judge of the effect produced upon him by the abrupt\nand unseasonable arrival of the cardinal.\n\nThat which he had to fear was only too fully realized. The entrance of\nhis eminence upset the audience. All heads turned towards the gallery.\nIt was no longer possible to hear one's self. \"The cardinal! The\ncardinal!\" repeated all mouths. The unhappy prologue stopped short for\nthe second time.\n\nThe cardinal halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade. While\nhe was sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the\ntumult redoubled. Each person wished to get a better view of him.\nEach man vied with the other in thrusting his head over his neighbor's\nshoulder.\n\nHe was, in fact, an exalted personage, the sight of whom was well worth\nany other comedy. Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, Archbishop and Comte of\nLyon, Primate of the Gauls, was allied both to Louis XI., through his\nbrother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king's eldest\ndaughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of Burgundy.\nNow, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the\ncharacter of the Primate of the Gauls, was the spirit of the courtier,\nand devotion to the powers that be. The reader can form an idea of the\nnumberless embarrassments which this double relationship had caused him,\nand of all the temporal reefs among which his spiritual bark had been\nforced to tack, in order not to suffer shipwreck on either Louis or\nCharles, that Scylla and that Charybdis which had devoured the Duc de\nNemours and the Constable de Saint-Pol. Thanks to Heaven's mercy, he had\nmade the voyage successfully, and had reached home without hindrance.\nBut although he was in port, and precisely because he was in port, he\nnever recalled without disquiet the varied haps of his political career,\nso long uneasy and laborious. Thus, he was in the habit of saying that\nthe year 1476 had been \"white and black\" for him--meaning thereby, that\nin the course of that year he had lost his mother, the Duchesse de la\nBourbonnais, and his cousin, the Duke of Burgundy, and that one grief\nhad consoled him for the other.\n\nNevertheless, he was a fine man; he led a joyous cardinal's life, liked\nto enliven himself with the royal vintage of Challuau, did not hate\nRicharde la Garmoise and Thomasse la Saillarde, bestowed alms on pretty\ngirls rather than on old women,--and for all these reasons was very\nagreeable to the populace of Paris. He never went about otherwise\nthan surrounded by a small court of bishops and abb\u00c3\u00a9s of high lineage,\ngallant, jovial, and given to carousing on occasion; and more than once\nthe good and devout women of Saint Germain d' Auxerre, when passing\nat night beneath the brightly illuminated windows of Bourbon, had been\nscandalized to hear the same voices which had intoned vespers for\nthem during the day carolling, to the clinking of glasses, the bacchic\nproverb of Benedict XII., that pope who had added a third crown to the\nTiara--_Bibamus papaliter_.\n\nIt was this justly acquired popularity, no doubt, which preserved him on\nhis entrance from any bad reception at the hands of the mob, which had\nbeen so displeased but a moment before, and very little disposed to\nrespect a cardinal on the very day when it was to elect a pope. But the\nParisians cherish little rancor; and then, having forced the beginning\nof the play by their authority, the good bourgeois had got the upper\nhand of the cardinal, and this triumph was sufficient for them.\nMoreover, the Cardinal de Bourbon was a handsome man,--he wore a fine\nscarlet robe, which he carried off very well,--that is to say, he had\nall the women on his side, and, consequently, the best half of the\naudience. Assuredly, it would be injustice and bad taste to hoot a\ncardinal for having come late to the spectacle, when he is a handsome\nman, and when he wears his scarlet robe well.\n\nHe entered, then, bowed to those present with the hereditary smile of\nthe great for the people, and directed his course slowly towards his\nscarlet velvet arm-chair, with the air of thinking of something quite\ndifferent. His cortege--what we should nowadays call his staff--of\nbishops and abb\u00c3\u00a9s invaded the estrade in his train, not without causing\nredoubled tumult and curiosity among the audience. Each man vied with\nhis neighbor in pointing them out and naming them, in seeing who should\nrecognize at least one of them: this one, the Bishop of Marseilles\n(Alaudet, if my memory serves me right);--this one, the primicier of\nSaint-Denis;--this one, Robert de Lespinasse, Abb\u00c3\u00a9 of Saint-Germain des\nPr\u00c3\u00a9s, that libertine brother of a mistress of Louis XI.; all with many\nerrors and absurdities. As for the scholars, they swore. This was their\nday, their feast of fools, their saturnalia, the annual orgy of the\ncorporation of Law clerks and of the school. There was no turpitude\nwhich was not sacred on that day. And then there were gay gossips in the\ncrowd--Simone Quatrelivres, Agnes la Gadine, and Rabine Pi\u00c3\u00a9debou. Was\nit not the least that one could do to swear at one's ease and revile\nthe name of God a little, on so fine a day, in such good company as\ndignitaries of the church and loose women? So they did not abstain; and,\nin the midst of the uproar, there was a frightful concert of blasphemies\nand enormities of all the unbridled tongues, the tongues of clerks and\nstudents restrained during the rest of the year, by the fear of the hot\niron of Saint Louis. Poor Saint Louis! how they set him at defiance in\nhis own court of law! Each one of them selected from the new-comers on\nthe platform, a black, gray, white, or violet cassock as his target.\nJoannes Frollo de Molendin, in his quality of brother to an archdeacon,\nboldly attacked the scarlet; he sang in deafening tones, with his\nimpudent eyes fastened on the cardinal, \"_Cappa repleta mero_!\"\n\nAll these details which we here lay bare for the edification of the\nreader, were so covered by the general uproar, that they were lost in it\nbefore reaching the reserved platforms; moreover, they would have\nmoved the cardinal but little, so much a part of the customs were the\nliberties of that day. Moreover, he had another cause for solicitude,\nand his mien as wholly preoccupied with it, which entered the estrade\nthe same time as himself; this was the embassy from Flanders.\n\nNot that he was a profound politician, nor was he borrowing trouble\nabout the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin Marguerite\nde Bourgoyne to his cousin Charles, Dauphin de Vienne; nor as to how\nlong the good understanding which had been patched up between the\nDuke of Austria and the King of France would last; nor how the King of\nEngland would take this disdain of his daughter. All that troubled him\nbut little; and he gave a warm reception every evening to the wine of\nthe royal vintage of Chaillot, without a suspicion that several flasks\nof that same wine (somewhat revised and corrected, it is true, by Doctor\nCoictier), cordially offered to Edward IV. by Louis XI., would, some\nfine morning, rid Louis XI. of Edward IV. \"The much honored embassy of\nMonsieur the Duke of Austria,\" brought the cardinal none of these cares,\nbut it troubled him in another direction. It was, in fact, somewhat\nhard, and we have already hinted at it on the second page of this\nbook,--for him, Charles de Bourbon, to be obliged to feast and receive\ncordially no one knows what bourgeois;--for him, a cardinal, to receive\naldermen;--for him, a Frenchman, and a jolly companion, to receive\nFlemish beer-drinkers,--and that in public! This was, certainly, one\nof the most irksome grimaces that he had ever executed for the good\npleasure of the king.\n\nSo he turned toward the door, and with the best grace in the world\n(so well had he trained himself to it), when the usher announced, in a\nsonorous voice, \"Messieurs the Envoys of Monsieur the Duke of Austria.\"\nIt is useless to add that the whole hall did the same.\n\nThen arrived, two by two, with a gravity which made a contrast in the\nmidst of the frisky ecclesiastical escort of Charles de Bourbon, the\neight and forty ambassadors of Maximilian of Austria, having at\ntheir head the reverend Father in God, Jehan, Abbot of Saint-Bertin,\nChancellor of the Golden Fleece, and Jacques de Goy, Sieur Dauby, Grand\nBailiff of Ghent. A deep silence settled over the assembly, accompanied\nby stifled laughter at the preposterous names and all the bourgeois\ndesignations which each of these personages transmitted with\nimperturbable gravity to the usher, who then tossed names and titles\npell-mell and mutilated to the crowd below. There were Master Loys\nRoelof, alderman of the city of Louvain; Messire Clays d'Etuelde,\nalderman of Brussels; Messire Paul de Baeust, Sieur de Voirmizelle,\nPresident of Flanders; Master Jehan Coleghens, burgomaster of the city\nof Antwerp; Master George de la Moere, first alderman of the kuere of\nthe city of Ghent; Master Gheldolf van der Hage, first alderman of the\n_parchous_ of the said town; and the Sieur de Bierbecque, and Jehan\nPinnock, and Jehan Dymaerzelle, etc., etc., etc.; bailiffs, aldermen,\nburgomasters; burgomasters, aldermen, bailiffs--all stiff, affectedly\ngrave, formal, dressed out in velvet and damask, hooded with caps of\nblack velvet, with great tufts of Cyprus gold thread; good Flemish\nheads, after all, severe and worthy faces, of the family which Rembrandt\nmakes to stand out so strong and grave from the black background of his\n\"Night Patrol \"; personages all of whom bore, written on their brows,\nthat Maximilian of Austria had done well in \"trusting implicitly,\" as\nthe manifest ran, \"in their sense, valor, experience, loyalty, and good\nwisdom.\"\n\nThere was one exception, however. It was a subtle, intelligent,\ncrafty-looking face, a sort of combined monkey and diplomat phiz, before\nwhom the cardinal made three steps and a profound bow, and whose name,\nnevertheless, was only, \"Guillaume Rym, counsellor and pensioner of the\nCity of Ghent.\"\n\nFew persons were then aware who Guillaume Rym was. A rare genius who\nin a time of revolution would have made a brilliant appearance on the\nsurface of events, but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to\ncavernous intrigues, and to \"living in mines,\" as the Duc de Saint-Simon\nexpresses it. Nevertheless, he was appreciated by the \"miner\" of Europe;\nhe plotted familiarly with Louis XI., and often lent a hand to the\nking's secret jobs. All which things were quite unknown to that throng,\nwho were amazed at the cardinal's politeness to that frail figure of a\nFlemish bailiff.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. MASTER JACQUES COPPENOLE.\n\n\n\nWhile the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low\nbows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with\na large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter\nabreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by\nthe side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on\nthe velvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some\ngroom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.\n\n\"Hold, my friend, you cannot pass!\"\n\nThe man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.\n\n\"What does this knave want with me?\" said he, in stentorian tones, which\nrendered the entire hall attentive to this strange colloquy. \"Don't you\nsee that I am one of them?\"\n\n\"Your name?\" demanded the usher.\n\n\"Jacques Coppenole.\"\n\n\"Your titles?\"\n\n\"Hosier at the sign of the 'Three Little Chains,' of Ghent.\"\n\nThe usher recoiled. One might bring one's self to announce aldermen and\nburgomasters, but a hosier was too much. The cardinal was on thorns.\nAll the people were staring and listening. For two days his eminence had\nbeen exerting his utmost efforts to lick these Flemish bears into shape,\nand to render them a little more presentable to the public, and this\nfreak was startling. But Guillaume Rym, with his polished smile,\napproached the usher.\n\n\"Announce Master Jacques Coppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the city of\nGhent,\" he whispered, very low.\n\n\"Usher,\" interposed the cardinal, aloud, \"announce Master Jacques\nCoppenole, clerk of the aldermen of the illustrious city of Ghent.\"\n\nThis was a mistake. Guillaume Rym alone might have conjured away the\ndifficulty, but Coppenole had heard the cardinal.\n\n\"No, cross of God?\" he exclaimed, in his voice of thunder, \"Jacques\nCoppenole, hosier. Do you hear, usher? Nothing more, nothing less. Cross\nof God! hosier; that's fine enough. Monsieur the Archduke has more than\nonce sought his _gant_* in my hose.\"\n\n\n     *  Got the first idea of a timing.\n\n\nLaughter and applause burst forth. A jest is always understood in Paris,\nand, consequently, always applauded.\n\nLet us add that Coppenole was of the people, and that the auditors which\nsurrounded him were also of the people. Thus the communication between\nhim and them had been prompt, electric, and, so to speak, on a level.\nThe haughty air of the Flemish hosier, by humiliating the courtiers,\nhad touched in all these plebeian souls that latent sentiment of dignity\nstill vague and indistinct in the fifteenth century.\n\nThis hosier was an equal, who had just held his own before monsieur the\ncardinal. A very sweet reflection to poor fellows habituated to respect\nand obedience towards the underlings of the sergeants of the bailiff of\nSainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve, the cardinal's train-bearer.\n\nCoppenole proudly saluted his eminence, who returned the salute of the\nall-powerful bourgeois feared by Louis XI. Then, while Guillaume Rym, a\n\"sage and malicious man,\" as Philippe de Comines puts it, watched them\nboth with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place,\nthe cardinal quite abashed and troubled, Coppenole tranquil and haughty,\nand thinking, no doubt, that his title of hosier was as good as any\nother, after all, and that Marie of Burgundy, mother to that Marguerite\nwhom Coppenole was to-day bestowing in marriage, would have been less\nafraid of the cardinal than of the hosier; for it is not a cardinal\nwho would have stirred up a revolt among the men of Ghent against the\nfavorites of the daughter of Charles the Bold; it is not a cardinal\nwho could have fortified the populace with a word against her tears\nand prayers, when the Maid of Flanders came to supplicate her people in\ntheir behalf, even at the very foot of the scaffold; while the hosier\nhad only to raise his leather elbow, in order to cause to fall your\ntwo heads, most illustrious seigneurs, Guy d'Hymbercourt and Chancellor\nGuillaume Hugonet.\n\nNevertheless, all was over for the poor cardinal, and he was obliged to\nquaff to the dregs the bitter cup of being in such b\u0016ad company.\n\nThe reader has, probably, not forgotten the impudent beggar who had been\nclinging fast to the fringes of the cardinal's gallery ever since the\nbeginning of the prologue. The arrival of the illustrious guests had\nby no means caused him to relax his hold, and, while the prelates\nand ambassadors were packing themselves into the stalls--like genuine\nFlemish herrings--he settled himself at his ease, and boldly crossed\nhis legs on the architrave. The insolence of this proceeding was\nextraordinary, yet no one noticed it at first, the attention of all\nbeing directed elsewhere. He, on his side, perceived nothing that\nwas going on in the hall; he wagged his head with the unconcern of a\nNeapolitan, repeating from time to time, amid the clamor, as from a\nmechanical habit, \"Charity, please!\" And, assuredly, he was, out of all\nthose present, the only one who had not deigned to turn his head at the\naltercation between Coppenole and the usher. Now, chance ordained that\nthe master hosier of Ghent, with whom the people were already in lively\nsympathy, and upon whom all eyes were riveted--should come and seat\nhimself in the front row of the gallery, directly above the mendicant;\nand people were not a little amazed to see the Flemish ambassador, on\nconcluding his inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes,\nbestow a friendly tap on that ragged shoulder. The beggar turned round;\nthere was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two countenances,\nand so forth; then, without paying the slightest heed in the world to\nthe spectators, the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a\nlow tone, holding each other's hands, in the meantime, while the rags\nof Clopin Trouillefou, spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais,\nproduced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange.\n\nThe novelty of this singular scene excited such a murmur of mirth and\ngayety in the hall, that the cardinal was not slow to perceive it; he\nhalf bent forward, and, as from the point where he was placed he could\ncatch only an imperfect view of Trouillerfou's ignominious doublet,\nhe very naturally imagined that the mendicant was asking alms, and,\ndisgusted with his audacity, he exclaimed: \"Bailiff of the Courts, toss\nme that knave into the river!\"\n\n\"Cross of God! monseigneur the cardinal,\" said Coppenole, without\nquitting Clopin's hand, \"he's a friend of mine.\"\n\n\"Good! good!\" shouted the populace. From that moment, Master Coppenole\nenjoyed in Paris as in Ghent, \"great favor with the people; for men of\nthat sort do enjoy it,\" says Philippe de Comines, \"when they are thus\ndisorderly.\" The cardinal bit his lips. He bent towards his neighbor,\nthe Abb\u00c3\u00a9 of Saint Genevi\u00c3\u00a9ve, and said to him in a low tone,--\"Fine\nambassadors monsieur the archduke sends here, to announce to us Madame\nMarguerite!\"\n\n\"Your eminence,\" replied the abb\u00c3\u00a9, \"wastes your politeness on these\nFlemish swine. _Margaritas ante porcos_, pearls before swine.\"\n\n\"Say rather,\" retorted the cardinal, with a smile, \"_Porcos ante\nMargaritam_, swine before the pearl.\"\n\nThe whole little court in cassocks went into ecstacies over this play\nupon words. The cardinal felt a little relieved; he was quits with\nCoppenole, he also had had his jest applauded.\n\nNow, will those of our readers who possess the power of generalizing an\nimage or an idea, as the expression runs in the style of to-day, permit\nus to ask them if they have formed a very clear conception of the\nspectacle presented at this moment, upon which we have arrested their\nattention, by the vast parallelogram of the grand hall of the palace.\n\nIn the middle of the hall, backed against the western wall, a large\nand magnificent gallery draped with cloth of gold, into which enter in\nprocession, through a small, arched door, grave personages, announced\nsuccessively by the shrill voice of an usher. On the front benches were\nalready a number of venerable figures, muffled in ermine, velvet, and\nscarlet. Around the dais--which remains silent and dignified--below,\nopposite, everywhere, a great crowd and a great murmur. Thousands of\nglances directed by the people on each face upon the dais, a thousand\nwhispers over each name. Certainly, the spectacle is curious, and well\ndeserves the attention of the spectators. But yonder, quite at the end,\nwhat is that sort of trestle work with four motley puppets upon it, and\nmore below? Who is that man beside the trestle, with a black doublet\nand a pale face? Alas! my dear reader, it is Pierre Gringoire and his\nprologue.\n\nWe have all forgotten him completely.\n\nThis is precisely what he feared.\n\nFrom the moment of the cardinal's entrance, Gringoire had never ceased\nto tremble for the safety of his prologue. At first he had enjoined the\nactors, who had stopped in suspense, to continue, and to raise their\nvoices; then, perceiving that no one was listening, he had stopped them;\nand, during the entire quarter of an hour that the interruption lasted,\nhe had not ceased to stamp, to flounce about, to appeal to Gisquette and\nLi\u00c3\u00a9narde, and to urge his neighbors to the continuance of the prologue;\nall in vain. No one quitted the cardinal, the embassy, and the\ngallery--sole centre of this vast circle of visual rays. We must also\nbelieve, and we say it with regret, that the prologue had begun slightly\nto weary the audience at the moment when his eminence had arrived, and\ncreated a diversion in so terrible a fashion. After all, on the gallery\nas well as on the marble table, the spectacle was the same: the conflict\nof Labor and Clergy, of Nobility and Merchandise. And many people\npreferred to see them alive, breathing, moving, elbowing each other in\nflesh and blood, in this Flemish embassy, in this Episcopal court, under\nthe cardinal's robe, under Coppenole's jerkin, than painted, decked\nout, talking in verse, and, so to speak, stuffed beneath the yellow amid\nwhite tunics in which Gringoire had so ridiculously clothed them.\n\nNevertheless, when our poet beheld quiet reestablished to some extent,\nhe devised a stratagem which might have redeemed all.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" he said, turning towards one of his neighbors, a fine, big\nman, with a patient face, \"suppose we begin again.\"\n\n\"What?\" said his neighbor.\n\n\"H\u00c3\u00a9! the Mystery,\" said Gringoire.\n\n\"As you like,\" returned his neighbor.\n\nThis semi-approbation sufficed for Gringoire, and, conducting his own\naffairs, he began to shout, confounding himself with the crowd as much\nas possible: \"Begin the mystery again! begin again!\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said Joannes de Molendino, \"what are they jabbering down\nyonder, at the end of the hall?\" (for Gringoire was making noise enough\nfor four.) \"Say, comrades, isn't that mystery finished? They want to\nbegin it all over again. That's not fair!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" shouted all the scholars. \"Down with the mystery! Down with\nit!\"\n\nBut Gringoire had multiplied himself, and only shouted the more\nvigorously: \"Begin again! begin again!\"\n\nThese clamors attracted the attention of the cardinal.\n\n\"Monsieur Bailiff of the Courts,\" said he to a tall, black man, placed a\nfew paces from him, \"are those knaves in a holy-water vessel, that they\nmake such a hellish noise?\"\n\nThe bailiff of the courts was a sort of amphibious magistrate, a sort\nof bat of the judicial order, related to both the rat and the bird, the\njudge and the soldier.\n\nHe approached his eminence, and not without a good deal of fear of\nthe latter's displeasure, he awkwardly explained to him the seeming\ndisrespect of the audience: that noonday had arrived before his\neminence, and that the comedians had been forced to begin without\nwaiting for his eminence.\n\nThe cardinal burst into a laugh.\n\n\"On my faith, the rector of the university ought to have done the same.\nWhat say you, Master Guillaume Rym?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" replied Guillaume Rym, \"let us be content with having\nescaped half of the comedy. There is at least that much gained.\"\n\n\"Can these rascals continue their farce?\" asked the bailiff.\n\n\"Continue, continue,\" said the cardinal, \"it's all the same to me. I'll\nread my breviary in the meantime.\"\n\nThe bailiff advanced to the edge of the estrade, and cried, after having\ninvoked silence by a wave of the hand,--\n\n\"Bourgeois, rustics, and citizens, in order to satisfy those who wish\nthe play to begin again, and those who wish it to end, his eminence\norders that it be continued.\"\n\nBoth parties were forced to resign themselves. But the public and the\nauthor long cherished a grudge against the cardinal.\n\nSo the personages on the stage took up their parts, and Gringoire hoped\nthat the rest of his work, at least, would be listened to. This hope was\nspeedily dispelled like his other illusions; silence had indeed,\nbeen restored in the audience, after a fashion; but Gringoire had\nnot observed that at the moment when the cardinal gave the order to\ncontinue, the gallery was far from full, and that after the Flemish\nenvoys there had arrived new personages forming part of the cortege,\nwhose names and ranks, shouted out in the midst of his dialogue by the\nintermittent cry of the usher, produced considerable ravages in it. Let\nthe reader imagine the effect in the midst of a theatrical piece, of the\nyelping of an usher, flinging in between two rhymes, and often in the\nmiddle of a line, parentheses like the following,--\n\n\"Master Jacques Charmolue, procurator to the king in the Ecclesiastical\nCourts!\"\n\n\"Jehan de Harlay, equerry guardian of the office of chevalier of the\nnight watch of the city of Paris!\"\n\n\"Messire Galiot de Genoilhac, chevalier, seigneur de Brussac, master of\nthe king's artillery!\"\n\n\"Master Dreux-Raguier, surveyor of the woods and forests of the king our\nsovereign, in the land of France, Champagne and Brie!\"\n\n\"Messire Louis de Graville, chevalier, councillor, and chamberlain of\nthe king, admiral of France, keeper of the Forest of Vincennes!\"\n\n\"Master Denis le Mercier, guardian of the house of the blind at Paris!\"\netc., etc., etc.\n\nThis was becoming unbearable.\n\nThis strange accompaniment, which rendered it difficult to follow\nthe piece, made Gringoire all the more indignant because he could\nnot conceal from himself the fact that the interest was continually\nincreasing, and that all his work required was a chance of being heard.\n\nIt was, in fact, difficult to imagine a more ingenious and more\ndramatic composition. The four personages of the prologue were bewailing\nthemselves in their mortal embarrassment, when Venus in person, (_vera\nincessa patuit dea_) presented herself to them, clad in a fine robe\nbearing the heraldic device of the ship of the city of Paris. She\nhad come herself to claim the dolphin promised to the most beautiful.\nJupiter, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing-room,\nsupported her claim, and Venus was on the point of carrying it\noff,--that is to say, without allegory, of marrying monsieur the\ndauphin, when a young child clad in white damask, and holding in her\nhand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite\nof Flanders) came to contest it with Venus.\n\nTheatrical effect and change.\n\nAfter a dispute, Venus, Marguerite, and the assistants agreed to submit\nto the good judgment of time holy Virgin. There was another good part,\nthat of the king of Mesopotamia; but through so many interruptions,\nit was difficult to make out what end he served. All these persons had\nascended by the ladder to the stage.\n\nBut all was over; none of these beauties had been felt nor understood.\nOn the entrance of the cardinal, one would have said that an invisible\nmagic thread had suddenly drawn all glances from the marble table to the\ngallery, from the southern to the western extremity of the hall. Nothing\ncould disenchant the audience; all eyes remained fixed there, and\nthe new-comers and their accursed names, and their faces, and their\ncostumes, afforded a continual diversion. This was very distressing.\nWith the exception of Gisquette and Li\u00c3\u00a9narde, who turned round from time\nto time when Gringoire plucked them by the sleeve; with the exception of\nthe big, patient neighbor, no one listened, no one looked at the poor,\ndeserted morality full face. Gringoire saw only profiles.\n\nWith what bitterness did he behold his whole erection of glory and of\npoetry crumble away bit by bit! And to think that these people had\nbeen upon the point of instituting a revolt against the bailiff through\nimpatience to hear his work! now that they had it they did not care for\nit. This same representation which had been begun amid so unanimous an\nacclamation! Eternal flood and ebb of popular favor! To think that they\nhad been on the point of hanging the bailiff's sergeant! What would he\nnot have given to be still at that hour of honey!\n\nBut the usher's brutal monologue came to an end; every one had arrived,\nand Gringoire breathed freely once more; the actors continued bravely.\nBut Master Coppenole, the hosier, must needs rise of a sudden, and\nGringoire was forced to listen to him deliver, amid universal attention,\nthe following abominable harangue.\n\n\"Messieurs the bourgeois and squires of Paris, I don't know, cross of\nGod! what we are doing here. I certainly do see yonder in the corner on\nthat stage, some people who appear to be fighting. I don't know whether\nthat is what you call a \"mystery,\" but it is not amusing; they quarrel\nwith their tongues and nothing more. I have been waiting for the first\nblow this quarter of an hour; nothing comes; they are cowards who only\nscratch each other with insults. You ought to send for the fighters of\nLondon or Rotterdam; and, I can tell you! you would have had blows of\nthe fist that could be heard in the Place; but these men excite our\npity. They ought at least, to give us a moorish dance, or some other\nmummer! That is not what was told me; I was promised a feast of fools,\nwith the election of a pope. We have our pope of fools at Ghent also;\nwe're not behindhand in that, cross of God! But this is the way we\nmanage it; we collect a crowd like this one here, then each person in\nturn passes his head through a hole, and makes a grimace at the rest;\ntime one who makes the ugliest, is elected pope by general acclamation;\nthat's the way it is. It is very diverting. Would you like to make your\npope after the fashion of my country? At all events, it will be less\nwearisome than to listen to chatterers. If they wish to come and make\ntheir grimaces through the hole, they can join the game. What say you,\nMessieurs les bourgeois? You have here enough grotesque specimens of\nboth sexes, to allow of laughing in Flemish fashion, and there are\nenough of us ugly in countenance to hope for a fine grinning match.\"\n\nGringoire would have liked to retort; stupefaction, rage, indignation,\ndeprived him of words. Moreover, the suggestion of the popular hosier\nwas received with such enthusiasm by these bourgeois who were flattered\nat being called \"squires,\" that all resistance was useless. There was\nnothing to be done but to allow one's self to drift with the torrent.\nGringoire hid his face between his two hands, not being so fortunate\nas to have a mantle with which to veil his head, like Agamemnon of\nTimantis.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. QUASIMODO.\n\n\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole's idea.\nBourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel\nsituated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the\ngrinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the\ndoor, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the\ncompetitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only\nnecessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced\nfrom I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.\nIt was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to\nchoose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of\nhis grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in\nthe chapel until the moment of his appearance. In less than an instant,\nthe chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then\nclosed.\n\nCoppenole, from his post, ordered all, directed all, arranged all.\nDuring the uproar, the cardinal, no less abashed than Gringoire, had\nretired with all his suite, under the pretext of business and vespers,\nwithout the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the\nleast moved by his departure. Guillaume Rym was the only one who noticed\nhis eminence's discomfiture. The attention of the populace, like the\nsun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall,\nand halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end.\nThe marble table, the brocaded gallery had each had their day; it was\nnow the turn of the chapel of Louis XI. Henceforth, the field was open\nto all folly. There was no one there now, but the Flemings and the\nrabble.\n\nThe grimaces began. The first face which appeared at the aperture,\nwith eyelids turned up to the reds, a mouth open like a maw, and a\nbrow wrinkled like our hussar boots of the Empire, evoked such an\ninextinguishable peal of laughter that Homer would have taken all these\nlouts for gods. Nevertheless, the grand hall was anything but Olympus,\nand Gringoire's poor Jupiter knew it better than any one else. A second\nand third grimace followed, then another and another; and the laughter\nand transports of delight went on increasing. There was in this\nspectacle, a peculiar power of intoxication and fascination, of which it\nwould be difficult to convey to the reader of our day and our salons any\nidea.\n\nLet the reader picture to himself a series of visages presenting\nsuccessively all geometrical forms, from the triangle to the trapezium,\nfrom the cone to the polyhedron; all human expressions, from wrath\nto lewdness; all ages, from the wrinkles of the new-born babe to the\nwrinkles of the aged and dying; all religious phantasmagories, from Faun\nto Beelzebub; all animal profiles, from the maw to the beak, from the\njowl to the muzzle. Let the reader imagine all these grotesque figures\nof the Pont Neuf, those nightmares petrified beneath the hand of Germain\nPilon, assuming life and breath, and coming in turn to stare you in the\nface with burning eyes; all the masks of the Carnival of Venice passing\nin succession before your glass,--in a word, a human kaleidoscope.\n\nThe orgy grew more and more Flemish. Teniers could have given but a very\nimperfect idea of it. Let the reader picture to himself in bacchanal\nform, Salvator Rosa's battle. There were no longer either scholars or\nambassadors or bourgeois or men or women; there was no longer any Clopin\nTrouillefou, nor Gilles Lecornu, nor Marie Quatrelivres, nor Robin\nPoussepain. All was universal license. The grand hall was no longer\nanything but a vast furnace of effrontry and joviality, where every\nmouth was a cry, every individual a posture; everything shouted and\nhowled. The strange visages which came, in turn, to gnash their teeth\nin the rose window, were like so many brands cast into the brazier;\nand from the whole of this effervescing crowd, there escaped, as from a\nfurnace, a sharp, piercing, stinging noise, hissing like the wings of a\ngnat.\n\n\"Ho h\u00c3\u00a9! curse it!\"\n\n\"Just look at that face!\"\n\n\"It's not good for anything.\"\n\n\"Guillemette Maugerepuis, just look at that bull's muzzle; it only lacks\nthe horns. It can't be your husband.\"\n\n\"Another!\"\n\n\"Belly of the pope! what sort of a grimace is that?\"\n\n\"Hola h\u00c3\u00a9! that's cheating. One must show only one's face.\"\n\n\"That damned Perrette Callebotte! she's capable of that!\"\n\n\"Good! Good!\"\n\n\"I'm stifling!\"\n\n\"There's a fellow whose ears won't go through!\" Etc., etc.\n\nBut we must do justice to our friend Jehan. In the midst of this\nwitches' sabbath, he was still to be seen on the top of his pillar, like\nthe cabin-boy on the topmast. He floundered about with incredible fury.\nHis mouth was wide open, and from it there escaped a cry which no one\nheard, not that it was covered by the general clamor, great as that\nwas but because it attained, no doubt, the limit of perceptible sharp\nsounds, the thousand vibrations of Sauveur, or the eight thousand of\nBiot.\n\nAs for Gringoire, the first moment of depression having passed, he\nhad regained his composure. He had hardened himself against\nadversity.---\"Continue!\" he had said for the third time, to his\ncomedians, speaking machines; then as he was marching with great strides\nin front of the marble table, a fancy seized him to go and appear in\nhis turn at the aperture of the chapel, were it only for the pleasure of\nmaking a grimace at that ungrateful populace.--\"But no, that would\nnot be worthy of us; no, vengeance! let us combat until the end,\" he\nrepeated to himself; \"the power of poetry over people is great; I will\nbring them back. We shall see which will carry the day, grimaces or\npolite literature.\"\n\nAlas! he had been left the sole spectator of his piece. It was far worse\nthan it had been a little while before. He no longer beheld anything but\nbacks.\n\nI am mistaken. The big, patient man, whom he had already consulted in a\ncritical moment, had remained with his face turned towards the stage. As\nfor Gisquette and Li\u00c3\u00a9narde, they had deserted him long ago.\n\nGringoire was touched to the heart by the fidelity of his only\nspectator. He approached him and addressed him, shaking his arm\nslightly; for the good man was leaning on the balustrade and dozing a\nlittle.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Gringoire, \"I thank you!\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the big man with a yawn, \"for what?\"\n\n\"I see what wearies you,\" resumed the poet; \"'tis all this noise which\nprevents your hearing comfortably. But be at ease! your name shall\ndescend to posterity! Your name, if you please?\"\n\n\"Renauld Chateau, guardian of the seals of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet of Paris, at\nyour service.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, you are the only representative of the muses here,\" said\nGringoire.\n\n\"You are too kind, sir,\" said the guardian of the seals at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet.\n\n\"You are the only one,\" resumed Gringoire, \"who has listened to the\npiece decorously. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"He! he!\" replied the fat magistrate, half aroused, \"it's tolerably\njolly, that's a fact.\"\n\nGringoire was forced to content himself with this eulogy; for a\nthunder of applause, mingled with a prodigious acclamation, cut their\nconversation short. The Pope of the Fools had been elected.\n\n\"Noel! Noel! Noel!\"* shouted the people on all sides. That was, in\nfact, a marvellous grimace which was beaming at that moment through the\naperture in the rose window. After all the pentagonal, hexagonal, and\nwhimsical faces, which had succeeded each other at that hole without\nrealizing the ideal of the grotesque which their imaginations, excited\nby the orgy, had constructed, nothing less was needed to win their\nsuffrages than the sublime grimace which had just dazzled the assembly.\nMaster Coppenole himself applauded, and Clopin Trouillefou, who had\nbeen among the competitors (and God knows what intensity of ugliness his\nvisage could attain), confessed himself conquered: We will do the same.\nWe shall not try to give the reader an idea of that tetrahedral nose,\nthat horseshoe mouth; that little left eye obstructed with a red, bushy,\nbristling eyebrow, while the right eye disappeared entirely beneath an\nenormous wart; of those teeth in disarray, broken here and there, like\nthe embattled parapet of a fortress; of that callous lip, upon which one\nof these teeth encroached, like the tusk of an elephant; of that forked\nchin; and above all, of the expression spread over the whole; of that\nmixture of malice, amazement, and sadness. Let the reader dream of this\nwhole, if he can.\n\n\n     *  The ancient French hurrah.\n\n\nThe acclamation was unanimous; people rushed towards the chapel. They\nmade the lucky Pope of the Fools come forth in triumph. But it was then\nthat surprise and admiration attained their highest pitch; the grimace\nwas his face.\n\nOr rather, his whole person was a grimace. A huge head, bristling\nwith red hair; between his shoulders an enormous hump, a counterpart\nperceptible in front; a system of thighs and legs so strangely astray\nthat they could touch each other only at the knees, and, viewed from\nthe front, resembled the crescents of two scythes joined by the\nhandles; large feet, monstrous hands; and, with all this deformity,\nan indescribable and redoubtable air of vigor, agility, and\ncourage,--strange exception to the eternal rule which wills that force\nas well as beauty shall be the result of harmony. Such was the pope whom\nthe fools had just chosen for themselves.\n\nOne would have pronounced him a giant who had been broken and badly put\ntogether again.\n\nWhen this species of cyclops appeared on the threshold of the chapel,\nmotionless, squat, and almost as broad as he was tall; squared on the\nbase, as a great man says; with his doublet half red, half violet, sown\nwith silver bells, and, above all, in the perfection of his ugliness,\nthe populace recognized him on the instant, and shouted with one\nvoice,--\n\n\"'Tis Quasimodo, the bellringer! 'tis Quasimodo, the hunchback of\nNotre-Dame! Quasimodo, the one-eyed! Quasimodo, the bandy-legged! Noel!\nNoel!\"\n\nIt will be seen that the poor fellow had a choice of surnames.\n\n\"Let the women with child beware!\" shouted the scholars.\n\n\"Or those who wish to be,\" resumed Joannes.\n\nThe women did, in fact, hide their faces.\n\n\"Oh! the horrible monkey!\" said one of them.\n\n\"As wicked as he is ugly,\" retorted another.\n\n\"He's the devil,\" added a third.\n\n\"I have the misfortune to live near Notre-Dame; I hear him prowling\nround the eaves by night.\"\n\n\"With the cats.\"\n\n\"He's always on our roofs.\"\n\n\"He throws spells down our chimneys.\"\n\n\"The other evening, he came and made a grimace at me through my attic\nwindow. I thought that it was a man. Such a fright as I had!\"\n\n\"I'm sure that he goes to the witches' sabbath. Once he left a broom on\nmy leads.\"\n\n\"Oh! what a displeasing hunchback's face!\"\n\n\"Oh! what an ill-favored soul!\"\n\n\"Whew!\"\n\nThe men, on the contrary, were delighted and applauded. Quasimodo, the\nobject of the tumult, still stood on the threshold of the chapel, sombre\nand grave, and allowed them to admire him.\n\nOne scholar (Robin Poussepain, I think), came and laughed in his face,\nand too close. Quasimodo contented himself with taking him by the\ngirdle, and hurling him ten paces off amid the crowd; all without\nuttering a word.\n\nMaster Coppenole, in amazement, approached him.\n\n\"Cross of God! Holy Father! you possess the handsomest ugliness that I\nhave ever beheld in my life. You would deserve to be pope at Rome, as\nwell as at Paris.\"\n\nSo saying, he placed his hand gayly on his shoulder. Quasimodo did not\nstir. Coppenole went on,--\n\n\"You are a rogue with whom I have a fancy for carousing, were it to cost\nme a new dozen of twelve livres of Tours. How does it strike you?\"\n\nQuasimodo made no reply.\n\n\"Cross of God!\" said the hosier, \"are you deaf?\"\n\nHe was, in truth, deaf.\n\nNevertheless, he began to grow impatient with Coppenole's behavior, and\nsuddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth, that\nthe Flemish giant recoiled, like a bull-dog before a cat.\n\nThen there was created around that strange personage, a circle of terror\nand respect, whose radius was at least fifteen geometrical feet. An old\nwoman explained to Coppenole that Quasimodo was deaf.\n\n\"Deaf!\" said the hosier, with his great Flemish laugh. \"Cross of God!\nHe's a perfect pope!\"\n\n\"He! I recognize him,\" exclaimed Jehan, who had, at last, descended from\nhis capital, in order to see Quasimodo at closer quarters, \"he's the\nbellringer of my brother, the archdeacon. Good-day, Quasimodo!\"\n\n\"What a devil of a man!\" said Robin Poussepain still all bruised\nwith his fall. \"He shows himself; he's a hunchback. He walks; he's\nbandy-legged. He looks at you; he's one-eyed. You speak to him; he's\ndeaf. And what does this Polyphemus do with his tongue?\"\n\n\"He speaks when he chooses,\" said the old woman; \"he became deaf through\nringing the bells. He is not dumb.\"\n\n\"That he lacks,\" remarks Jehan.\n\n\"And he has one eye too many,\" added Robin Poussepain.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Jehan wisely. \"A one-eyed man is far less complete\nthan a blind man. He knows what he lacks.\"\n\nIn the meantime, all the beggars, all the lackeys, all the cutpurses,\njoined with the scholars, had gone in procession to seek, in the\ncupboard of the law clerks' company, the cardboard tiara, and the\nderisive robe of the Pope of the Fools. Quasimodo allowed them to array\nhim in them without wincing, and with a sort of proud docility. Then\nthey made him seat himself on a motley litter. Twelve officers of the\nfraternity of fools raised him on their shoulders; and a sort of bitter\nand disdainful joy lighted up the morose face of the cyclops, when he\nbeheld beneath his deformed feet all those heads of handsome, straight,\nwell-made men. Then the ragged and howling procession set out on its\nmarch, according to custom, around the inner galleries of the Courts,\nbefore making the circuit of the streets and squares.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. ESMERALDA.\n\n\n\nWe are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole\nof this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors,\nspurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not\nceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and\nwas determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return\nof attention on the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired\nfresh life, when he saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort\nof the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar.\nThe throng rushed eagerly after them. \"Good,\" he said to himself, \"there\ngo all the mischief-makers.\" Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers\nconstituted the entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand\nhall was empty.\n\nTo tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered,\nothers in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children,\nwho had had enough of the uproar and tumult. Some scholars were still\nperched astride of the window-sills, engaged in gazing into the Place.\n\n\"Well,\" thought Gringoire, \"here are still as many as are required to\nhear the end of my mystery. They are few in number, but it is a choice\naudience, a lettered audience.\"\n\nAn instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the\ngreatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking. Gringoire\nperceived that his music had been carried off by the procession of the\nPope of the Fools. \"Skip it,\" said he, stoically.\n\nHe approached a group of bourgeois, who seemed to him to be discussing\nhis piece. This is the fragment of conversation which he caught,--\n\n\"You know, Master Cheneteau, the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Navarre, which belonged to\nMonsieur de Nemours?\"\n\n\"Yes, opposite the Chapelle de Braque.\"\n\n\"Well, the treasury has just let it to Guillaume Alixandre, historian,\nfor six hivres, eight sols, parisian, a year.\"\n\n\"How rents are going up!\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Gringoire to himself, with a sigh, \"the others are\nlistening.\"\n\n\"Comrades,\" suddenly shouted one of the young scamps from the window,\n\"La Esmeralda! La Esmeralda in the Place!\"\n\nThis word produced a magical effect. Every one who was left in the hall\nflew to the windows, climbing the walls in order to see, and repeating,\n\"La Esmeralda! La Esmeralda?\" At the same time, a great sound of\napplause was heard from without.\n\n\"What's the meaning of this, of the Esmeralda?\" said Gringoire, wringing\nhis hands in despair. \"Ah, good heavens! it seems to be the turn of the\nwindows now.\"\n\nHe returned towards the marble table, and saw that the representation\nhad been interrupted. It was precisely at the instant when Jupiter\nshould have appeared with his thunder. But Jupiter was standing\nmotionless at the foot of the stage.\n\n\"Michel Giborne!\" cried the irritated poet, \"what are you doing there?\nIs that your part? Come up!\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Jupiter, \"a scholar has just seized the ladder.\"\n\nGringoire looked. It was but too true. All communication between his\nplot and its solution was intercepted.\n\n\"The rascal,\" he murmured. \"And why did he take that ladder?\"\n\n\"In order to go and see the Esmeralda,\" replied Jupiter piteously. \"He\nsaid, 'Come, here's a ladder that's of no use!' and he took it.\"\n\nThis was the last blow. Gringoire received it with resignation.\n\n\"May the devil fly away with you!\" he said to the comedian, \"and if I\nget my pay, you shall receive yours.\"\n\nThen he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field,\nlike a general who has fought well.\n\nAnd as he descended the winding stairs of the courts: \"A fine rabble of\nasses and dolts these Parisians!\" he muttered between his teeth; \"they\ncome to hear a mystery and don't listen to it at all! They are engrossed\nby every one, by Chopin Trouillefou, by the cardinal, by Coppenole, by\nQuasimodo, by the devil! but by Madame the Virgin Mary, not at all. If\nI had known, I'd have given you Virgin Mary; you ninnies! And I! to\ncome to see faces and behold only backs! to be a poet, and to reap the\nsuccess of an apothecary! It is true that Homerus begged through the\nGreek towns, and that Naso died in exile among the Muscovites. But may\nthe devil flay me if I understand what they mean with their Esmeralda!\nWhat is that word, in the first place?--'tis Egyptian!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SECOND.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. FROM CHARYBDIS TO SCYLLA.\n\n\nNight comes on early in January. The streets were already dark when\nGringoire issued forth from the Courts. This gloom pleased him; he was\nin haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley, in order there to\nmeditate at his ease, and in order that the philosopher might place the\nfirst dressing upon the wound of the poet. Philosophy, moreover, was his\nsole refuge, for he did not know where he was to lodge for the night.\nAfter the brilliant failure of his first theatrical venture, he\ndared not return to the lodging which he occupied in the Rue\nGrenier-sur-l'Eau, opposite to the Port-au-Foin, having depended\nupon receiving from monsieur the provost for his epithalamium, the\nwherewithal to pay Master Guillaume Doulx-Sire, farmer of the taxes on\ncloven-footed animals in Paris, the rent which he owed him, that is\nto say, twelve sols parisian; twelve times the value of all that he\npossessed in the world, including his trunk-hose, his shirt, and his\ncap. After reflecting a moment, temporarily sheltered beneath the little\nwicket of the prison of the treasurer of the Sainte-Chappelle, as to the\nshelter which he would select for the night, having all the pavements of\nParis to choose from, he remembered to have noticed the week previously\nin the Rue de la Savaterie, at the door of a councillor of the\nparliament, a stepping stone for mounting a mule, and to have said to\nhimself that that stone would furnish, on occasion, a very excellent\npillow for a mendicant or a poet. He thanked Providence for having sent\nthis happy idea to him; but, as he was preparing to cross the Place,\nin order to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city, where meander\nall those old sister streets, the Rues de la Barillerie, de la\nVielle-Draperie, de la Savaterie, de la Juiverie, etc., still extant\nto-day, with their nine-story houses, he saw the procession of the Pope\nof the Fools, which was also emerging from the court house, and rushing\nacross the courtyard, with great cries, a great flashing of torches, and\nthe music which belonged to him, Gringoire. This sight revived the\npain of his self-love; he fled. In the bitterness of his dramatic\nmisadventure, everything which reminded him of the festival of that day\nirritated his wound and made it bleed.\n\n58\n\nHe was on the point of turning to the Pont Saint-Michel; children were\nrunning about here and there with fire lances and rockets.\n\n\"Pest on firework candles!\" said Gringoire; and he fell back on the Pont\nau Change. To the house at the head of the bridge there had been affixed\nthree small banners, representing the king, the dauphin, and Marguerite\nof Flanders, and six little pennons on which were portrayed the Duke of\nAustria, the Cardinal de Bourbon, M. de Beaujeu, and Madame Jeanne de\nFrance, and Monsieur the Bastard of Bourbon, and I know not whom else;\nall being illuminated with torches. The rabble were admiring.\n\n\"Happy painter, Jehan Fourbault!\" said Gringoire with a deep sigh;\nand he turned his back upon the bannerets and pennons. A street opened\nbefore him; he thought it so dark and deserted that he hoped to there\nescape from all the rumors as well as from all the gleams of the\nfestival. At the end of a few moments his foot came in contact with an\nobstacle; he stumbled and fell. It was the May truss, which the clerks\nof the clerks' law court had deposited that morning at the door of\na president of the parliament, in honor of the solemnity of the day.\nGringoire bore this new disaster heroically; he picked himself up, and\nreached the water's edge. After leaving behind him the civic Tournelle*\nand the criminal tower, and skirted the great walls of the king's\ngarden, on that unpaved strand where the mud reached to his ankles, he\nreached the western point of the city, and considered for some time\nthe islet of the Passeur-aux-Vaches, which has disappeared beneath the\nbronze horse of the Pont Neuf. The islet appeared to him in the shadow\nlike a black mass, beyond the narrow strip of whitish water which\nseparated him from it. One could divine by the ray of a tiny light the\nsort of hut in the form of a beehive where the ferryman of cows took\nrefuge at night.\n\n\n     *  A chamber of the ancient parliament of Paris.\n\n\n\"Happy ferryman!\" thought Gringoire; \"you do not dream of glory, and\nyou do not make marriage songs! What matters it to you, if kings and\nDuchesses of Burgundy marry? You know no other daisies (_marguerites_)\nthan those which your April greensward gives your cows to browse upon;\nwhile I, a poet, am hooted, and shiver, and owe twelve sous, and the\nsoles of my shoes are so transparent, that they might serve as glasses\nfor your lantern! Thanks, ferryman, your cabin rests my eyes, and makes\nme forget Paris!\"\n\nHe was roused from his almost lyric ecstacy, by a big double Saint-Jean\ncracker, which suddenly went off from the happy cabin. It was the cow\nferryman, who was taking his part in the rejoicings of the day, and\nletting off fireworks.\n\nThis cracker made Gringoire's skin bristle up all over.\n\n\"Accursed festival!\" he exclaimed, \"wilt thou pursue me everywhere? Oh!\ngood God! even to the ferryman's!\"\n\nThen he looked at the Seine at his feet, and a horrible temptation took\npossession of him:\n\n\"Oh!\" said he, \"I would gladly drown myself, were the water not so\ncold!\"\n\nThen a desperate resolution occurred to him. It was, since he could not\nescape from the Pope of the Fools, from Jehan Fourbault's bannerets,\nfrom May trusses, from squibs and crackers, to go to the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\n\"At least,\" he said to himself, \"I shall there have a firebrand of joy\nwherewith to warm myself, and I can sup on some crumbs of the three\ngreat armorial bearings of royal sugar which have been erected on the\npublic refreshment-stall of the city.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE PLACE DE GREVE.\n\n\n\nThere remains to-day but a very imperceptible vestige of the Place\nde Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, such as it existed then; it consists in the charming little\nturret, which occupies the angle north of the Place, and which, already\nenshrouded in the ignoble plaster which fills with paste the delicate\nlines of its sculpture, would soon have disappeared, perhaps submerged\nby that flood of new houses which so rapidly devours all the ancient\nfa\u00c3\u00a7ades of Paris.\n\nThe persons who, like ourselves, never cross the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve without\ncasting a glance of pity and sympathy on that poor turret strangled\nbetween two hovels of the time of Louis XV., can easily reconstruct in\ntheir minds the aggregate of edifices to which it belonged, and find\nagain entire in it the ancient Gothic place of the fifteenth century.\n\nIt was then, as it is to-day, an irregular trapezoid, bordered on one\nside by the quay, and on the other three by a series of lofty, narrow,\nand gloomy houses. By day, one could admire the variety of its edifices,\nall sculptured in stone or wood, and already presenting complete\nspecimens of the different domestic architectures of the Middle Ages,\nrunning back from the fifteenth to the eleventh century, from the\ncasement which had begun to dethrone the arch, to the Roman semicircle,\nwhich had been supplanted by the ogive, and which still occupies, below\nit, the first story of that ancient house de la Tour Roland, at the\ncorner of the Place upon the Seine, on the side of the street with the\nTannerie. At night, one could distinguish nothing of all that mass of\nbuildings, except the black indentation of the roofs, unrolling\ntheir chain of acute angles round the place; for one of the radical\ndifferences between the cities of that time, and the cities of the\npresent day, lay in the fa\u00c3\u00a7ades which looked upon the places and\nstreets, and which were then gables. For the last two centuries the\nhouses have been turned round.\n\nIn the centre of the eastern side of the Place, rose a heavy and hybrid\nconstruction, formed of three buildings placed in juxtaposition. It was\ncalled by three names which explain its history, its destination, and\nits architecture: \"The House of the Dauphin,\" because Charles V., when\nDauphin, had inhabited it; \"The Marchandise,\" because it had served as\ntown hall; and \"The Pillared House\" (_domus ad piloria_), because of\na series of large pillars which sustained the three stories. The city\nfound there all that is required for a city like Paris; a chapel in\nwhich to pray to God; a _plaidoyer_, or pleading room, in which to hold\nhearings, and to repel, at need, the King's people; and under the roof,\nan _arsenac_ full of artillery. For the bourgeois of Paris were aware\nthat it is not sufficient to pray in every conjuncture, and to plead\nfor the franchises of the city, and they had always in reserve, in the\ngarret of the town hall, a few good rusty arquebuses. The Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve had then\nthat sinister aspect which it preserves to-day from the execrable ideas\nwhich it awakens, and from the sombre town hall of Dominique Bocador,\nwhich has replaced the Pillared House. It must be admitted that a\npermanent gibbet and a pillory, \"a justice and a ladder,\" as they were\ncalled in that day, erected side by side in the centre of the pavement,\ncontributed not a little to cause eyes to be turned away from that\nfatal place, where so many beings full of life and health have agonized;\nwhere, fifty years later, that fever of Saint Vallier was destined to\nhave its birth, that terror of the scaffold, the most monstrous of all\nmaladies because it comes not from God, but from man.\n\nIt is a consoling idea (let us remark in passing), to think that the\ndeath penalty, which three hundred years ago still encumbered with its\niron wheels, its stone gibbets, and all its paraphernalia of torture,\npermanent and riveted to the pavement, the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, the Halles, the Place\nDauphine, the Cross du Trahoir, the March\u00c3\u00a9 aux Pourceaux, that hideous\nMontfau\u00c3\u00a7on, the barrier des Sergents, the Place aux Chats, the Porte\nSaint-Denis, Champeaux, the Porte Baudets, the Porte Saint Jacques,\nwithout reckoning the innumerable ladders of the provosts, the bishop of\nthe chapters, of the abbots, of the priors, who had the decree of life\nand death,--without reckoning the judicial drownings in the river Seine;\nit is consoling to-day, after having lost successively all the pieces of\nits armor, its luxury of torment, its penalty of imagination and fancy,\nits torture for which it reconstructed every five years a leather bed\nat the Grand Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, that ancient suzerain of feudal society almost\nexpunged from our laws and our cities, hunted from code to code, chased\nfrom place to place, has no longer, in our immense Paris, any more than\na dishonored corner of the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve,--than a miserable guillotine, furtive,\nuneasy, shameful, which seems always afraid of being caught in the act,\nso quickly does it disappear after having dealt its blow.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. KISSES FOR BLOWS.\n\n\n\nWhen Pierre Gringoire arrived on the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, he was paralyzed.\nHe had directed his course across the Pont aux Meuniers, in order\nto avoid the rabble on the Pont au Change, and the pennons of Jehan\nFourbault; but the wheels of all the bishop's mills had splashed him as\nhe passed, and his doublet was drenched; it seemed to him besides, that\nthe failure of his piece had rendered him still more sensible to cold\nthan usual. Hence he made haste to draw near the bonfire, which was\nburning magnificently in the middle of the Place. But a considerable\ncrowd formed a circle around it.\n\n\"Accursed Parisians!\" he said to himself (for Gringoire, like a true\ndramatic poet, was subject to monologues) \"there they are obstructing my\nfire! Nevertheless, I am greatly in need of a chimney corner; my shoes\ndrink in the water, and all those cursed mills wept upon me! That devil\nof a Bishop of Paris, with his mills! I'd just like to know what use a\nbishop can make of a mill! Does he expect to become a miller instead of\na bishop? If only my malediction is needed for that, I bestow it upon\nhim! and his cathedral, and his mills! Just see if those boobies will\nput themselves out! Move aside! I'd like to know what they are doing\nthere! They are warming themselves, much pleasure may it give them! They\nare watching a hundred fagots burn; a fine spectacle!\"\n\nOn looking more closely, he perceived that the circle was much larger\nthan was required simply for the purpose of getting warm at the king's\nfire, and that this concourse of people had not been attracted solely by\nthe beauty of the hundred fagots which were burning.\n\nIn a vast space left free between the crowd and the fire, a young girl\nwas dancing.\n\nWhether this young girl was a human being, a fairy, or an angel, is what\nGringoire, sceptical philosopher and ironical poet that he was, could\nnot decide at the first moment, so fascinated was he by this dazzling\nvision.\n\nShe was not tall, though she seemed so, so boldly did her slender form\ndart about. She was swarthy of complexion, but one divined that, by day,\nher skin must possess that beautiful golden tone of the Andalusians and\nthe Roman women. Her little foot, too, was Andalusian, for it was both\npinched and at ease in its graceful shoe. She danced, she turned, she\nwhirled rapidly about on an old Persian rug, spread negligently under\nher feet; and each time that her radiant face passed before you, as she\nwhirled, her great black eyes darted a flash of lightning at you.\n\nAll around her, all glances were riveted, all mouths open; and, in fact,\nwhen she danced thus, to the humming of the Basque tambourine, which\nher two pure, rounded arms raised above her head, slender, frail and\nvivacious as a wasp, with her corsage of gold without a fold, her\nvariegated gown puffing out, her bare shoulders, her delicate limbs,\nwhich her petticoat revealed at times, her black hair, her eyes of\nflame, she was a supernatural creature.\n\n\"In truth,\" said Gringoire to himself, \"she is a salamander, she is a\nnymph, she is a goddess, she is a bacchante of the Menelean Mount!\"\n\nAt that moment, one of the salamander's braids of hair became\nunfastened, and a piece of yellow copper which was attached to it,\nrolled to the ground.\n\n\"H\u00c3\u00a9, no!\" said he, \"she is a gypsy!\"\n\nAll illusions had disappeared.\n\nShe began her dance once more; she took from the ground two swords,\nwhose points she rested against her brow, and which she made to turn\nin one direction, while she turned in the other; it was a purely gypsy\neffect. But, disenchanted though Gringoire was, the whole effect of\nthis picture was not without its charm and its magic; the bonfire\nilluminated, with a red flaring light, which trembled, all alive, over\nthe circle of faces in the crowd, on the brow of the young girl, and at\nthe background of the Place cast a pallid reflection, on one side upon\nthe ancient, black, and wrinkled fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the House of Pillars, on the\nother, upon the old stone gibbet.\n\nAmong the thousands of visages which that light tinged with scarlet,\nthere was one which seemed, even more than all the others, absorbed in\ncontemplation of the dancer. It was the face of a man, austere, calm,\nand sombre. This man, whose costume was concealed by the crowd which\nsurrounded him, did not appear to be more than five and thirty years of\nage; nevertheless, he was bald; he had merely a few tufts of thin, gray\nhair on his temples; his broad, high forehead had begun to be furrowed\nwith wrinkles, but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary\nyouthfulness, an ardent life, a profound passion. He kept them fixed\nincessantly on the gypsy, and, while the giddy young girl of sixteen\ndanced and whirled, for the pleasure of all, his revery seemed to become\nmore and more sombre. From time to time, a smile and a sigh met upon his\nlips, but the smile was more melancholy than the sigh.\n\nThe young girl, stopped at length, breathless, and the people applauded\nher lovingly.\n\n\"Djali!\" said the gypsy.\n\nThen Gringoire saw come up to her, a pretty little white goat, alert,\nwide-awake, glossy, with gilded horns, gilded hoofs, and gilded collar,\nwhich he had not hitherto perceived, and which had remained lying curled\nup on one corner of the carpet watching his mistress dance.\n\n\"Djali!\" said the dancer, \"it is your turn.\"\n\nAnd, seating herself, she gracefully presented her tambourine to the\ngoat.\n\n\"Djali,\" she continued, \"what month is this?\"\n\nThe goat lifted its fore foot, and struck one blow upon the tambourine.\nIt was the first month in the year, in fact.\n\n\"Djali,\" pursued the young girl, turning her tambourine round, \"what day\nof the month is this?\"\n\nDjali raised his little gilt hoof, and struck six blows on the\ntambourine.\n\n\"Djali,\" pursued the Egyptian, with still another movement of the\ntambourine, \"what hour of the day is it?\"\n\nDjali struck seven blows. At that moment, the clock of the Pillar House\nrang out seven.\n\nThe people were amazed.\n\n\"There's sorcery at the bottom of it,\" said a sinister voice in the\ncrowd. It was that of the bald man, who never removed his eyes from the\ngypsy.\n\nShe shuddered and turned round; but applause broke forth and drowned the\nmorose exclamation.\n\nIt even effaced it so completely from her mind, that she continued to\nquestion her goat.\n\n\"Djali, what does Master Guichard Grand-Remy, captain of the pistoliers\nof the town do, at the procession of Candlemas?\"\n\nDjali reared himself on his hind legs, and began to bleat, marching\nalong with so much dainty gravity, that the entire circle of spectators\nburst into a laugh at this parody of the interested devoutness of the\ncaptain of pistoliers.\n\n\"Djali,\" resumed the young girl, emboldened by her growing success,\n\"how preaches Master Jacques Charmolue, procurator to the king in the\necclesiastical court?\"\n\nThe goat seated himself on his hind quarters, and began to bleat, waving\nhis fore feet in so strange a manner, that, with the exception of\nthe bad French, and worse Latin, Jacques Charmolue was there\ncomplete,--gesture, accent, and attitude.\n\nAnd the crowd applauded louder than ever.\n\n\"Sacrilege! profanation!\" resumed the voice of the bald man.\n\nThe gypsy turned round once more.\n\n\"Ah!\" said she, \"'tis that villanous man!\" Then, thrusting her under\nlip out beyond the upper, she made a little pout, which appeared to\nbe familiar to her, executed a pirouette on her heel, and set about\ncollecting in her tambourine the gifts of the multitude.\n\nBig blanks, little blanks, targes* and eagle liards showered into it.\n\n\n     *  A blank: an old French coin; six blanks were worth two sous\nand a half; targe, an ancient coin of Burgundy, a farthing.\n\n\nAll at once, she passed in front of Gringoire. Gringoire put his hand so\nrecklessly into his pocket that she halted. \"The devil!\" said the poet,\nfinding at the bottom of his pocket the reality, that is, to say, a\nvoid. In the meantime, the pretty girl stood there, gazing at him\nwith her big eyes, and holding out her tambourine to him and waiting.\nGringoire broke into a violent perspiration.\n\nIf he had all Peru in his pocket, he would certainly have given it to\nthe dancer; but Gringoire had not Peru, and, moreover, America had not\nyet been discovered.\n\nHappily, an unexpected incident came to his rescue.\n\n\"Will you take yourself off, you Egyptian grasshopper?\" cried a sharp\nvoice, which proceeded from the darkest corner of the Place.\n\nThe young girl turned round in affright. It was no longer the voice of\nthe bald man; it was the voice of a woman, bigoted and malicious.\n\nHowever, this cry, which alarmed the gypsy, delighted a troop of\nchildren who were prowling about there.\n\n\"It is the recluse of the Tour-Roland,\" they exclaimed, with wild\nlaughter, \"it is the sacked nun who is scolding! Hasn't she supped?\nLet's carry her the remains of the city refreshments!\"\n\nAll rushed towards the Pillar House.\n\nIn the meanwhile, Gringoire had taken advantage of the dancer's\nembarrassment, to disappear. The children's shouts had reminded him that\nhe, also, had not supped, so he ran to the public buffet. But the little\nrascals had better legs than he; when he arrived, they had stripped the\ntable. There remained not so much as a miserable _camichon_ at five sous\nthe pound. Nothing remained upon the wall but slender fleurs-de-lis,\nmingled with rose bushes, painted in 1434 by Mathieu Biterne. It was a\nmeagre supper.\n\nIt is an unpleasant thing to go to bed without supper, it is a still\nless pleasant thing not to sup and not to know where one is to sleep.\nThat was Gringoire's condition. No supper, no shelter; he saw himself\npressed on all sides by necessity, and he found necessity very crabbed.\nHe had long ago discovered the truth, that Jupiter created men during a\nfit of misanthropy, and that during a wise man's whole life, his destiny\nholds his philosophy in a state of siege. As for himself, he had never\nseen the blockade so complete; he heard his stomach sounding a parley,\nand he considered it very much out of place that evil destiny should\ncapture his philosophy by famine.\n\nThis melancholy revery was absorbing him more and more, when a song,\nquaint but full of sweetness, suddenly tore him from it. It was the\nyoung gypsy who was singing.\n\nHer voice was like her dancing, like her beauty. It was indefinable\nand charming; something pure and sonorous, aerial, winged, so to speak.\nThere were continual outbursts, melodies, unexpected cadences, then\nsimple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes; then floods of\nscales which would have put a nightingale to rout, but in which harmony\nwas always present; then soft modulations of octaves which rose and\nfell, like the bosom of the young singer. Her beautiful face followed,\nwith singular mobility, all the caprices of her song, from the wildest\ninspiration to the chastest dignity. One would have pronounced her now a\nmad creature, now a queen.\n\nThe words which she sang were in a tongue unknown to Gringoire, and\nwhich seemed to him to be unknown to herself, so little relation did\nthe expression which she imparted to her song bear to the sense of the\nwords. Thus, these four lines, in her mouth, were madly gay,--\n\n\n  _Un cofre de gran riqueza\n    Hallaron dentro un pilar,\n  Dentro del, nuevas banderas\n   Con figuras de espantar_.*\n\n\n     *  A coffer of great richness\n    In a pillar's heart they found,\n   Within it lay new banners,\n    With figures to astound.\n\n\nAnd an instant afterwards, at the accents which she imparted to this\nstanza,--\n\n\n  _Alarabes de cavallo\n   Sin poderse menear,\n  Con espadas, y los cuellos,\n   Ballestas de buen echar_,\n\n\nGringoire felt the tears start to his eyes. Nevertheless, her song\nbreathed joy, most of all, and she seemed to sing like a bird, from\nserenity and heedlessness.\n\nThe gypsy's song had disturbed Gringoire's revery as the swan disturbs\nthe water. He listened in a sort of rapture, and forgetfulness of\neverything. It was the first moment in the course of many hours when he\ndid not feel that he suffered.\n\nThe moment was brief.\n\nThe same woman's voice, which had interrupted the gypsy's dance,\ninterrupted her song.\n\n\"Will you hold your tongue, you cricket of hell?\" it cried, still from\nthe same obscure corner of the place.\n\nThe poor \"cricket\" stopped short. Gringoire covered up his ears.\n\n\"Oh!\" he exclaimed, \"accursed saw with missing teeth, which comes to\nbreak the lyre!\"\n\nMeanwhile, the other spectators murmured like himself; \"To the devil\nwith the sacked nun!\" said some of them. And the old invisible kill-joy\nmight have had occasion to repent of her aggressions against the gypsy\nhad their attention not been diverted at this moment by the procession\nof the Pope of the Fools, which, after having traversed many streets and\nsquares, debouched on the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, with all its torches and all\nits uproar.\n\nThis procession, which our readers have seen set out from the Palais\nde Justice, had organized on the way, and had been recruited by all\nthe knaves, idle thieves, and unemployed vagabonds in Paris; so that it\npresented a very respectable aspect when it arrived at the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\nFirst came Egypt. The Duke of Egypt headed it, on horseback, with his\ncounts on foot holding his bridle and stirrups for him; behind them, the\nmale and female Egyptians, pell-mell, with their little children\ncrying on their shoulders; all--duke, counts, and populace--in rags and\ntatters. Then came the Kingdom of Argot; that is to say, all the thieves\nof France, arranged according to the order of their dignity; the minor\npeople walking first. Thus defiled by fours, with the divers insignia of\ntheir grades, in that strange faculty, most of them lame, some\ncripples, others one-armed, shop clerks, pilgrim, _hubins_, bootblacks,\nthimble-riggers, street arabs, beggars, the blear-eyed beggars, thieves,\nthe weakly, vagabonds, merchants, sham soldiers, goldsmiths, passed\nmasters of pickpockets, isolated thieves. A catalogue that would\nweary Homer. In the centre of the conclave of the passed masters of\npickpockets, one had some difficulty in distinguishing the King of\nArgot, the grand co\u00c3\u00absre, so called, crouching in a little cart drawn\nby two big dogs. After the kingdom of the Argotiers, came the Empire of\nGalilee. Guillaume Rousseau, Emperor of the Empire of Galilee, marched\nmajestically in his robe of purple, spotted with wine, preceded by\nbuffoons wrestling and executing military dances; surrounded by his\nmacebearers, his pickpockets and clerks of the chamber of accounts. Last\nof all came the corporation of law clerks, with its maypoles crowned\nwith flowers, its black robes, its music worthy of the orgy, and its\nlarge candles of yellow wax. In the centre of this crowd, the grand\nofficers of the Brotherhood of Fools bore on their shoulders a litter\nmore loaded down with candles than the reliquary of Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve in\ntime of pest; and on this litter shone resplendent, with crosier, cope,\nand mitre, the new Pope of the Fools, the bellringer of Notre-Dame,\nQuasimodo the hunchback.\n\nEach section of this grotesque procession had its own music. The\nEgyptians made their drums and African tambourines resound. The slang\nmen, not a very musical race, still clung to the goat's horn trumpet and\nthe Gothic rubebbe of the twelfth century. The Empire of Galilee was not\nmuch more advanced; among its music one could hardly distinguish some\nmiserable rebec, from the infancy of the art, still imprisoned in the\n_re-la-mi_. But it was around the Pope of the Fools that all the musical\nriches of the epoch were displayed in a magnificent discord. It was\nnothing but soprano rebecs, counter-tenor rebecs, and tenor rebecs,\nnot to reckon the flutes and brass instruments. Alas! our readers will\nremember that this was Gringoire's orchestra.\n\nIt is difficult to convey an idea of the degree of proud and blissful\nexpansion to which the sad and hideous visage of Quasimodo had attained\nduring the transit from the Palais de Justice, to the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. It\nwas the first enjoyment of self-love that he had ever experienced. Down\nto that day, he had known only humiliation, disdain for his condition,\ndisgust for his person. Hence, deaf though he was, he enjoyed, like a\nveritable pope, the acclamations of that throng, which he hated because\nhe felt that he was hated by it. What mattered it that his people\nconsisted of a pack of fools, cripples, thieves, and beggars? it was\nstill a people and he was its sovereign. And he accepted seriously all\nthis ironical applause, all this derisive respect, with which the crowd\nmingled, it must be admitted, a good deal of very real fear. For the\nhunchback was robust; for the bandy-legged fellow was agile; for the\ndeaf man was malicious: three qualities which temper ridicule.\n\nWe are far from believing, however, that the new Pope of the Fools\nunderstood both the sentiments which he felt and the sentiments which\nhe inspired. The spirit which was lodged in this failure of a body had,\nnecessarily, something incomplete and deaf about it. Thus, what he felt\nat the moment was to him, absolutely vague, indistinct, and confused.\nOnly joy made itself felt, only pride dominated. Around that sombre and\nunhappy face, there hung a radiance.\n\nIt was, then, not without surprise and alarm, that at the very moment\nwhen Quasimodo was passing the Pillar House, in that semi-intoxicated\nstate, a man was seen to dart from the crowd, and to tear from his\nhands, with a gesture of anger, his crosier of gilded wood, the emblem\nof his mock popeship.\n\nThis man, this rash individual, was the man with the bald brow, who,\na moment earlier, standing with the gypsy's group had chilled the\npoor girl with his words of menace and of hatred. He was dressed in\nan ecclesiastical costume. At the moment when he stood forth from the\ncrowd, Gringoire, who had not noticed him up to that time, recognized\nhim: \"Hold!\" he said, with an exclamation of astonishment. \"Eh! 'tis my\nmaster in Hermes, Dom Claude Frollo, the archdeacon! What the devil does\nhe want of that old one-eyed fellow? He'll get himself devoured!\"\n\nA cry of terror arose, in fact. The formidable Quasimodo had hurled\nhimself from the litter, and the women turned aside their eyes in order\nnot to see him tear the archdeacon asunder.\n\nHe made one bound as far as the priest, looked at him, and fell upon his\nknees.\n\nThe priest tore off his tiara, broke his crozier, and rent his tinsel\ncope.\n\nQuasimodo remained on his knees, with head bent and hands clasped.\nThen there was established between them a strange dialogue of signs\nand gestures, for neither of them spoke. The priest, erect on his\nfeet, irritated, threatening, imperious; Quasimodo, prostrate, humble,\nsuppliant. And, nevertheless, it is certain that Quasimodo could have\ncrushed the priest with his thumb.\n\nAt length the archdeacon, giving Quasimodo's powerful shoulder a rough\nshake, made him a sign to rise and follow him.\n\nQuasimodo rose.\n\nThen the Brotherhood of Fools, their first stupor having passed off,\nwished to defend their pope, so abruptly dethroned. The Egyptians, the\nmen of slang, and all the fraternity of law clerks, gathered howling\nround the priest.\n\nQuasimodo placed himself in front of the priest, set in play the muscles\nof his athletic fists, and glared upon the assailants with the snarl of\nan angry tiger.\n\nThe priest resumed his sombre gravity, made a sign to Quasimodo, and\nretired in silence.\n\nQuasimodo walked in front of him, scattering the crowd as he passed.\n\nWhen they had traversed the populace and the Place, the cloud of curious\nand idle were minded to follow them. Quasimodo then constituted himself\nthe rearguard, and followed the archdeacon, walking backwards, squat,\nsurly, monstrous, bristling, gathering up his limbs, licking his boar's\ntusks, growling like a wild beast, and imparting to the crowd immense\nvibrations, with a look or a gesture.\n\nBoth were allowed to plunge into a dark and narrow street, where no\none dared to venture after them; so thoroughly did the mere chimera of\nQuasimodo gnashing his teeth bar the entrance.\n\n\"Here's a marvellous thing,\" said Gringoire; \"but where the deuce shall\nI find some supper?\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE INCONVENIENCES OF FOLLOWING A PRETTY WOMAN THROUGH THE\nSTREETS IN THE EVENING.\n\n\n\nGringoire set out to follow the gypsy at all hazards. He had seen her,\naccompanied by her goat, take to the Rue de la Coutellerie; he took the\nRue de la Coutellerie.\n\n\"Why not?\" he said to himself.\n\nGringoire, a practical philosopher of the streets of Paris, had noticed\nthat nothing is more propitious to revery than following a pretty\nwoman without knowing whither she is going. There was in this voluntary\nabdication of his freewill, in this fancy submitting itself to another\nfancy, which suspects it not, a mixture of fantastic independence and\nblind obedience, something indescribable, intermediate between slavery\nand liberty, which pleased Gringoire,--a spirit essentially compound,\nundecided, and complex, holding the extremities of all extremes,\nincessantly suspended between all human propensities, and neutralizing\none by the other. He was fond of comparing himself to Mahomet's coffin,\nattracted in two different directions by two loadstones, and hesitating\neternally between the heights and the depths, between the vault and the\npavement, between fall and ascent, between zenith and nadir.\n\nIf Gringoire had lived in our day, what a fine middle course he would\nhold between classicism and romanticism!\n\nBut he was not sufficiently primitive to live three hundred years,\nand 'tis a pity. His absence is a void which is but too sensibly felt\nto-day.\n\nMoreover, for the purpose of thus following passers-by (and especially\nfemale passers-by) in the streets, which Gringoire was fond of doing,\nthere is no better disposition than ignorance of where one is going to\nsleep.\n\nSo he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who\nhastened her pace and made her goat trot as she saw the bourgeois\nreturning home and the taverns--the only shops which had been open that\nday--closing.\n\n\"After all,\" he half thought to himself, \"she must lodge somewhere;\ngypsies have kindly hearts. Who knows?--\"\n\nAnd in the points of suspense which he placed after this reticence in\nhis mind, there lay I know not what flattering ideas.\n\nMeanwhile, from time to time, as he passed the last groups of bourgeois\nclosing their doors, he caught some scraps of their conversation, which\nbroke the thread of his pleasant hypotheses.\n\nNow it was two old men accosting each other.\n\n\"Do you know that it is cold, Master Thibaut Fernicle?\" (Gringoire had\nbeen aware of this since the beginning of the winter.)\n\n\"Yes, indeed, Master Boniface Disome! Are we going to have a winter\nsuch as we had three years ago, in '80, when wood cost eight sous the\nmeasure?\"\n\n\"Bah! that's nothing, Master Thibaut, compared with the winter of 1407,\nwhen it froze from St. Martin's Day until Candlemas! and so cold that\nthe pen of the registrar of the parliament froze every three words, in\nthe Grand Chamber! which interrupted the registration of justice.\"\n\nFurther on there were two female neighbors at their windows, holding\ncandles, which the fog caused to sputter.\n\n\"Has your husband told you about the mishap, Mademoiselle la Boudraque?\"\n\n\"No. What is it, Mademoiselle Turquant?\"\n\n\"The horse of M. Gilles Godin, the notary at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, took fright\nat the Flemings and their procession, and overturned Master Philippe\nAvrillot, lay monk of the C\u00c3\u00a9lestins.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Actually.\"\n\n\"A bourgeois horse! 'tis rather too much! If it had been a cavalry\nhorse, well and good!\"\n\nAnd the windows were closed. But Gringoire had lost the thread of his\nideas, nevertheless.\n\nFortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together\nwithout difficulty, thanks to the gypsy, thanks to Djali, who still\nwalked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures,\nwhose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in\nadmiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them\nto be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship;\nregarding them both as goats,--so far as the lightness, agility, and\ndexterity of their walk were concerned.\n\nBut the streets were becoming blacker and more deserted every moment.\nThe curfew had sounded long ago, and it was only at rare intervals\nnow that they encountered a passer-by in the street, or a light in the\nwindows. Gringoire had become involved, in his pursuit of the gypsy, in\nthat inextricable labyrinth of alleys, squares, and closed courts\nwhich surround the ancient sepulchre of the Saints-Innocents, and which\nresembles a ball of thread tangled by a cat. \"Here are streets which\npossess but little logic!\" said Gringoire, lost in the thousands of\ncircuits which returned upon themselves incessantly, but where the young\ngirl pursued a road which seemed familiar to her, without hesitation and\nwith a step which became ever more rapid. As for him, he would have been\nutterly ignorant of his situation had he not espied, in passing, at the\nturn of a street, the octagonal mass of the pillory of the fish markets,\nthe open-work summit of which threw its black, fretted outlines clearly\nupon a window which was still lighted in the Rue Verdelet.\n\nThe young girl's attention had been attracted to him for the last few\nmoments; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness;\nshe had even once come to a standstill, and taking advantage of a ray of\nlight which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently, from\nhead to foot, then, having cast this glance, Gringoire had seen her make\nthat little pout which he had already noticed, after which she passed\non.\n\nThis little pout had furnished Gringoire with food for thought. There\nwas certainly both disdain and mockery in that graceful grimace. So he\ndropped his head, began to count the paving-stones, and to follow the\nyoung girl at a little greater distance, when, at the turn of a street,\nwhich had caused him to lose sight of her, he heard her utter a piercing\ncry.\n\nHe hastened his steps.\n\nThe street was full of shadows. Nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in\noil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the Holy Virgin at the street\ncorner, permitted Gringoire to make out the gypsy struggling in the arms\nof two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries. The poor little\ngoat, in great alarm, lowered his horns and bleated.\n\n\"Help! gentlemen of the watch!\" shouted Gringoire, and advanced bravely.\nOne of the men who held the young girl turned towards him. It was the\nformidable visage of Quasimodo.\n\nGringoire did not take to flight, but neither did he advance another\nstep.\n\nQuasimodo came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement\nwith a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom,\nbearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf. His\ncompanion followed him, and the poor goat ran after them all, bleating\nplaintively.\n\n\"Murder! murder!\" shrieked the unhappy gypsy.\n\n\"Halt, rascals, and yield me that wench!\" suddenly shouted in a voice of\nthunder, a cavalier who appeared suddenly from a neighboring square.\n\nIt was a captain of the king's archers, armed from head to foot, with\nhis sword in his hand.\n\nHe tore the gypsy from the arms of the dazed Quasimodo, threw her across\nhis saddle, and at the moment when the terrible hunchback, recovering\nfrom his surprise, rushed upon him to regain his prey, fifteen or\nsixteen archers, who followed their captain closely, made their\nappearance, with their two-edged swords in their fists. It was a squad\nof the king's police, which was making the rounds, by order of Messire\nRobert d'Estouteville, guard of the provostship of Paris.\n\nQuasimodo was surrounded, seized, garroted; he roared, he foamed at the\nmouth, he bit; and had it been broad daylight, there is no doubt that\nhis face alone, rendered more hideous by wrath, would have put the\nentire squad to flight. But by night he was deprived of his most\nformidable weapon, his ugliness.\n\nHis companion had disappeared during the struggle.\n\nThe gypsy gracefully raised herself upright upon the officer's saddle,\nplaced both hands upon the young man's shoulders, and gazed fixedly at\nhim for several seconds, as though enchanted with his good looks and\nwith the aid which he had just rendered her. Then breaking silence\nfirst, she said to him, making her sweet voice still sweeter than\nusual,--\n\n\"What is your name, monsieur le gendarme?\"\n\n\"Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers, at your service, my beauty!\" replied\nthe officer, drawing himself up.\n\n\"Thanks,\" said she.\n\nAnd while Captain Phoebus was turning up his moustache in Burgundian\nfashion, she slipped from the horse, like an arrow falling to earth, and\nfled.\n\nA flash of lightning would have vanished less quickly.\n\n\"Nombrill of the Pope!\" said the captain, causing Quasimodo's straps to\nbe drawn tighter, \"I should have preferred to keep the wench.\"\n\n\"What would you have, captain?\" said one gendarme. \"The warbler has\nfled, and the bat remains.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. RESULT OF THE DANGERS.\n\n\nGringoire, thoroughly stunned by his fall, remained on the pavement\nin front of the Holy Virgin at the street corner. Little by little, he\nregained his senses; at first, for several minutes, he was floating in a\nsort of half-somnolent revery, which was not without its charm, in which\naeriel figures of the gypsy and her goat were coupled with Quasimodo's\nheavy fist. This state lasted but a short time. A decidedly vivid\nsensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the\npavement, suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the\nsurface.\n\n\"Whence comes this chill?\" he said abruptly, to himself. He then\nperceived that he was lying half in the middle of the gutter.\n\n\"That devil of a hunchbacked cyclops!\" he muttered between his teeth;\nand he tried to rise. But he was too much dazed and bruised; he was\nforced to remain where he was. Moreover, his hand was tolerably free; he\nstopped up his nose and resigned himself.\n\n\"The mud of Paris,\" he said to himself--for decidedly he thought that he\nwas sure that the gutter would prove his refuge for the night; and what\ncan one do in a refuge, except dream?--\"the mud of Paris is particularly\nstinking; it must contain a great deal of volatile and nitric salts.\nThat, moreover, is the opinion of Master Nicholas Flamel, and of the\nalchemists--\"\n\nThe word \"alchemists\" suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of\nArchdeacon Claude Frollo. He recalled the violent scene which he had\njust witnessed in part; that the gypsy was struggling with two men,\nthat Quasimodo had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of\nthe archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory. \"That would be\nstrange!\" he said to himself. And on that fact and that basis he began\nto construct a fantastic edifice of hypothesis, that card-castle of\nphilosophers; then, suddenly returning once more to reality, \"Come! I'm\nfreezing!\" he ejaculated.\n\nThe place was, in fact, becoming less and less tenable. Each molecule\nof the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire's\nloins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the\ntemperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion.\n\nQuite a different annoyance suddenly assailed him. A group of children,\nthose little bare-footed savages who have always roamed the pavements\nof Paris under the eternal name of _gamins_, and who, when we were also\nchildren ourselves, threw stones at all of us in the afternoon, when we\ncame out of school, because our trousers were not torn--a swarm of these\nyoung scamps rushed towards the square where Gringoire lay, with shouts\nand laughter which seemed to pay but little heed to the sleep of the\nneighbors. They were dragging after them some sort of hideous sack;\nand the noise of their wooden shoes alone would have roused the dead.\nGringoire who was not quite dead yet, half raised himself.\n\n\"Oh\u00c3\u00a9, Hennequin Dand\u00c3\u00a9che! Oh\u00c3\u00a8, Jehan Pincebourde!\" they shouted in\ndeafening tones, \"old Eustache Moubon, the merchant at the corner, has\njust died. We've got his straw pallet, we're going to have a bonfire out\nof it. It's the turn of the Flemish to-day!\"\n\nAnd behold, they flung the pallet directly upon Gringoire, beside whom\nthey had arrived, without espying him. At the same time, one of them\ntook a handful of straw and set off to light it at the wick of the good\nVirgin.\n\n\"S'death!\" growled Gringoire, \"am I going to be too warm now?\"\n\nIt was a critical moment. He was caught between fire and water; he made\na superhuman effort, the effort of a counterfeiter of money who is on\nthe point of being boiled, and who seeks to escape. He rose to his feet,\nflung aside the straw pallet upon the street urchins, and fled.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" shrieked the children; \"'tis the merchant's ghost!\"\n\nAnd they fled in their turn.\n\nThe straw mattress remained master of the field. Belleforet, Father\nLe Juge, and Corrozet affirm that it was picked up on the morrow, with\ngreat pomp, by the clergy of the quarter, and borne to the treasury\nof the church of Saint Opportune, where the sacristan, even as late as\n1789, earned a tolerably handsome revenue out of the great miracle of\nthe Statue of the Virgin at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, which\nhad, by its mere presence, on the memorable night between the sixth and\nseventh of January, 1482, exorcised the defunct Eustache Moubon, who,\nin order to play a trick on the devil, had at his death maliciously\nconcealed his soul in his straw pallet.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE BROKEN JUG.\n\n\n\nAfter having run for some time at the top of his speed, without knowing\nwhither, knocking his head against many a street corner, leaping many a\ngutter, traversing many an alley, many a court, many a square, seeking\nflight and passage through all the meanderings of the ancient passages\nof the Halles, exploring in his panic terror what the fine Latin of the\nmaps calls _tota via, cheminum et viaria_, our poet suddenly halted for\nlack of breath in the first place, and in the second, because he had\nbeen collared, after a fashion, by a dilemma which had just occurred to\nhis mind. \"It strikes me, Master Pierre Gringoire,\" he said to himself,\nplacing his finger to his brow, \"that you are running like a madman. The\nlittle scamps are no less afraid of you than you are of them. It strikes\nme, I say, that you heard the clatter of their wooden shoes fleeing\nsouthward, while you were fleeing northward. Now, one of two things,\neither they have taken flight, and the pallet, which they must have\nforgotten in their terror, is precisely that hospitable bed in search\nof which you have been running ever since morning, and which madame the\nVirgin miraculously sends you, in order to recompense you for having\nmade a morality in her honor, accompanied by triumphs and mummeries; or\nthe children have not taken flight, and in that case they have put the\nbrand to the pallet, and that is precisely the good fire which you need\nto cheer, dry, and warm you. In either case, good fire or good bed, that\nstraw pallet is a gift from heaven. The blessed Virgin Marie who stands\nat the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, could only have made Eustache\nMoubon die for that express purpose; and it is folly on your part to\nflee thus zigzag, like a Picard before a Frenchman, leaving behind you\nwhat you seek before you; and you are a fool!\"\n\nThen he retraced his steps, and feeling his way and searching, with his\nnose to the wind and his ears on the alert, he tried to find the\nblessed pallet again, but in vain. There was nothing to be found but\nintersections of houses, closed courts, and crossings of streets, in\nthe midst of which he hesitated and doubted incessantly, being more\nperplexed and entangled in this medley of streets than he would have\nbeen even in the labyrinth of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel des Tournelles. At length he\nlost patience, and exclaimed solemnly: \"Cursed be cross roads! 'tis the\ndevil who has made them in the shape of his pitchfork!\"\n\nThis exclamation afforded him a little solace, and a sort of reddish\nreflection which he caught sight of at that moment, at the extremity of\na long and narrow lane, completed the elevation of his moral tone. \"God\nbe praised!\" said he, \"There it is yonder! There is my pallet burning.\"\nAnd comparing himself to the pilot who suffers shipwreck by night,\n\"_Salve_,\" he added piously, \"_salve, maris stella_!\"\n\nDid he address this fragment of litany to the Holy Virgin, or to the\npallet? We are utterly unable to say.\n\nHe had taken but a few steps in the long street, which sloped downwards,\nwas unpaved, and more and more muddy and steep, when he noticed a very\nsingular thing. It was not deserted; here and there along its extent\ncrawled certain vague and formless masses, all directing their course\ntowards the light which flickered at the end of the street, like those\nheavy insects which drag along by night, from blade to blade of grass,\ntowards the shepherd's fire.\n\nNothing renders one so adventurous as not being able to feel the place\nwhere one's pocket is situated. Gringoire continued to advance, and had\nsoon joined that one of the forms which dragged along most indolently,\nbehind the others. On drawing near, he perceived that it was nothing\nelse than a wretched legless cripple in a bowl, who was hopping along on\nhis two hands like a wounded field-spider which has but two legs left.\nAt the moment when he passed close to this species of spider with a\nhuman countenance, it raised towards him a lamentable voice: \"_La buona\nmancia, signor! la buona mancia_!\"*\n\n\n     *  Alms.\n\n\n\"Deuce take you,\" said Gringoire, \"and me with you, if I know what you\nmean!\"\n\nAnd he passed on.\n\nHe overtook another of these itinerant masses, and examined it. It was\nan impotent man, both halt and crippled, and halt and crippled to such\na degree that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which\nsustained him, gave him the air of a mason's scaffolding on the march.\nGringoire, who liked noble and classical comparisons, compared him in\nthought to the living tripod of Vulcan.\n\nThis living tripod saluted him as he passed, but stopping his hat on a\nlevel with Gringoire's chin, like a shaving dish, while he shouted in\nthe latter's ears: \"_Senor cabellero, para comprar un pedaso de pan_!\"*\n\n\n     *  Give me the means to buy a bit of bread, sir.\n\n\n\"It appears,\" said Gringoire, \"that this one can also talk; but 'tis a\nrude language, and he is more fortunate than I if he understands it.\"\nThen, smiting his brow, in a sudden transition of ideas: \"By the way,\nwhat the deuce did they mean this morning with their Esmeralda?\"\n\nHe was minded to augment his pace, but for the third time something\nbarred his way. This something or, rather, some one was a blind man, a\nlittle blind fellow with a bearded, Jewish face, who, rowing away in the\nspace about him with a stick, and towed by a large dog, droned through\nhis nose with a Hungarian accent: \"_Facitote caritatem_!\"\n\n\"Well, now,\" said Gringoire, \"here's one at last who speaks a Christian\ntongue. I must have a very charitable aspect, since they ask alms of\nme in the present lean condition of my purse. My friend,\" and he turned\ntowards the blind man, \"I sold my last shirt last week; that is to say,\nsince you understand only the language of Cicero: _Vendidi hebdomade\nnuper transita meam ultimam chemisan_.\"\n\nThat said, he turned his back upon the blind man, and pursued his way.\nBut the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time; and,\nbehold! the cripple and the legless man, in his bowl, came up on their\nside in great haste, and with great clamor of bowl and crutches, upon\nthe pavement. Then all three, jostling each other at poor Gringoire's\nheels, began to sing their song to him,--\n\n\"_Caritatem_!\" chanted the blind man.\n\n\"_La buona mancia_!\" chanted the cripple in the bowl.\n\nAnd the lame man took up the musical phrase by repeating: \"_Un pedaso de\npan_!\"\n\nGringoire stopped up his ears. \"Oh, tower of Babel!\" he exclaimed.\n\nHe set out to run. The blind man ran! The lame man ran! The cripple in\nthe bowl ran!\n\nAnd then, in proportion as he plunged deeper into the street, cripples\nin bowls, blind men and lame men, swarmed about him, and men with one\narm, and with one eye, and the leprous with their sores, some emerging\nfrom little streets adjacent, some from the air-holes of cellars,\nhowling, bellowing, yelping, all limping and halting, all flinging\nthemselves towards the light, and humped up in the mire, like snails\nafter a shower.\n\nGringoire, still followed by his three persecutors, and not knowing\nvery well what was to become of him, marched along in terror among them,\nturning out for the lame, stepping over the cripples in bowls, with his\nfeet imbedded in that ant-hill of lame men, like the English captain who\ngot caught in the quicksand of a swarm of crabs.\n\nThe idea occurred to him of making an effort to retrace his steps. But\nit was too late. This whole legion had closed in behind him, and his\nthree beggars held him fast. So he proceeded, impelled both by this\nirresistible flood, by fear, and by a vertigo which converted all this\ninto a sort of horrible dream.\n\nAt last he reached the end of the street. It opened upon an immense\nplace, where a thousand scattered lights flickered in the confused mists\nof night. Gringoire flew thither, hoping to escape, by the swiftness of\nhis legs, from the three infirm spectres who had clutched him.\n\n\"_Onde vas, hombre_?\" (Where are you going, my man?) cried the cripple,\nflinging away his crutches, and running after him with the best legs\nthat ever traced a geometrical step upon the pavements of Paris.\n\nIn the meantime the legless man, erect upon his feet, crowned Gringoire\nwith his heavy iron bowl, and the blind man glared in his face with\nflaming eyes!\n\n\"Where am I?\" said the terrified poet.\n\n\"In the Court of Miracles,\" replied a fourth spectre, who had accosted\nthem.\n\n\"Upon my soul,\" resumed Gringoire, \"I certainly do behold the blind who\nsee, and the lame who walk, but where is the Saviour?\"\n\nThey replied by a burst of sinister laughter.\n\nThe poor poet cast his eyes about him. It was, in truth, that\nredoubtable Cour des Miracles, whither an honest man had never\npenetrated at such an hour; the magic circle where the officers of the\nCh\u00c3\u00a2telet and the sergeants of the provostship, who ventured thither,\ndisappeared in morsels; a city of thieves, a hideous wart on the face of\nParis; a sewer, from which escaped every morning, and whither returned\nevery night to crouch, that stream of vices, of mendicancy and\nvagabondage which always overflows in the streets of capitals; a\nmonstrous hive, to which returned at nightfall, with their booty, all\nthe drones of the social order; a lying hospital where the bohemian, the\ndisfrocked monk, the ruined scholar, the ne'er-do-wells of all nations,\nSpaniards, Italians, Germans,--of all religions, Jews, Christians,\nMahometans, idolaters, covered with painted sores, beggars by day, were\ntransformed by night into brigands; an immense dressing-room, in a word,\nwhere, at that epoch, the actors of that eternal comedy, which theft,\nprostitution, and murder play upon the pavements of Paris, dressed and\nundressed.\n\nIt was a vast place, irregular and badly paved, like all the squares of\nParis at that date. Fires, around which swarmed strange groups, blazed\nhere and there. Every one was going, coming, and shouting. Shrill\nlaughter was to be heard, the wailing of children, the voices of\nwomen. The hands and heads of this throng, black against the luminous\nbackground, outlined against it a thousand eccentric gestures. At times,\nupon the ground, where trembled the light of the fires, mingled with\nlarge, indefinite shadows, one could behold a dog passing, which\nresembled a man, a man who resembled a dog. The limits of races and\nspecies seemed effaced in this city, as in a pandemonium. Men, women,\nbeasts, age, sex, health, maladies, all seemed to be in common among\nthese people; all went together, they mingled, confounded, superposed;\neach one there participated in all.\n\nThe poor and flickering flames of the fire permitted Gringoire to\ndistinguish, amid his trouble, all around the immense place, a hideous\nframe of ancient houses, whose wormeaten, shrivelled, stunted fa\u00c3\u00a7ades,\neach pierced with one or two lighted attic windows, seemed to him, in\nthe darkness, like enormous heads of old women, ranged in a circle,\nmonstrous and crabbed, winking as they looked on at the Witches'\nSabbath.\n\nIt was like a new world, unknown, unheard of, misshapen, creeping,\nswarming, fantastic.\n\nGringoire, more and more terrified, clutched by the three beggars as by\nthree pairs of tongs, dazed by a throng of other faces which frothed and\nyelped around him, unhappy Gringoire endeavored to summon his presence\nof mind, in order to recall whether it was a Saturday. But his efforts\nwere vain; the thread of his memory and of his thought was broken; and,\ndoubting everything, wavering between what he saw and what he felt, he\nput to himself this unanswerable question,--\n\n\"If I exist, does this exist? if this exists, do I exist?\"\n\nAt that moment, a distinct cry arose in the buzzing throng which\nsurrounded him, \"Let's take him to the king! let's take him to the\nking!\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" murmured Gringoire, \"the king here must be a ram.\"\n\n\"To the king! to the king!\" repeated all voices.\n\nThey dragged him off. Each vied with the other in laying his claws upon\nhim. But the three beggars did not loose their hold and tore him from\nthe rest, howling, \"He belongs to us!\"\n\nThe poet's already sickly doublet yielded its last sigh in this\nstruggle.\n\nWhile traversing the horrible place, his vertigo vanished. After taking\na few steps, the sentiment of reality returned to him. He began to\nbecome accustomed to the atmosphere of the place. At the first moment\nthere had arisen from his poet's head, or, simply and prosaically,\nfrom his empty stomach, a mist, a vapor, so to speak, which, spreading\nbetween objects and himself, permitted him to catch a glimpse of them\nonly in the incoherent fog of nightmare,--in those shadows of dreams\nwhich distort every outline, agglomerating objects into unwieldy groups,\ndilating things into chimeras, and men into phantoms. Little by little,\nthis hallucination was succeeded by a less bewildered and exaggerating\nview. Reality made its way to the light around him, struck his eyes,\nstruck his feet, and demolished, bit by bit, all that frightful poetry\nwith which he had, at first, believed himself to be surrounded. He was\nforced to perceive that he was not walking in the Styx, but in mud, that\nhe was elbowed not by demons, but by thieves; that it was not his soul\nwhich was in question, but his life (since he lacked that precious\nconciliator, which places itself so effectually between the bandit and\nthe honest man--a purse). In short, on examining the orgy more closely,\nand with more coolness, he fell from the witches' sabbath to the\ndram-shop.\n\nThe Cour des Miracles was, in fact, merely a dram-shop; but a brigand's\ndram-shop, reddened quite as much with blood as with wine.\n\nThe spectacle which presented itself to his eyes, when his ragged escort\nfinally deposited him at the end of his trip, was not fitted to bear him\nback to poetry, even to the poetry of hell. It was more than ever the\nprosaic and brutal reality of the tavern. Were we not in the fifteenth\ncentury, we would say that Gringoire had descended from Michael Angelo\nto Callot.\n\nAround a great fire which burned on a large, circular flagstone, the\nflames of which had heated red-hot the legs of a tripod, which was\nempty for the moment, some wormeaten tables were placed, here and there,\nhaphazard, no lackey of a geometrical turn having deigned to adjust\ntheir parallelism, or to see to it that they did not make too unusual\nangles. Upon these tables gleamed several dripping pots of wine and\nbeer, and round these pots were grouped many bacchic visages, purple\nwith the fire and the wine. There was a man with a huge belly and a\njovial face, noisily kissing a woman of the town, thickset and brawny.\nThere was a sort of sham soldier, a \"naquois,\" as the slang expression\nruns, who was whistling as he undid the bandages from his fictitious\nwound, and removing the numbness from his sound and vigorous knee, which\nhad been swathed since morning in a thousand ligatures. On the other\nhand, there was a wretched fellow, preparing with celandine and beef's\nblood, his \"leg of God,\" for the next day. Two tables further on, a\npalmer, with his pilgrim's costume complete, was practising the lament\nof the Holy Queen, not forgetting the drone and the nasal drawl. Further\non, a young scamp was taking a lesson in epilepsy from an old pretender,\nwho was instructing him in the art of foaming at the mouth, by chewing a\nmorsel of soap. Beside him, a man with the dropsy was getting rid of his\nswelling, and making four or five female thieves, who were disputing\nat the same table, over a child who had been stolen that evening, hold\ntheir noses. All circumstances which, two centuries later, \"seemed so\nridiculous to the court,\" as Sauval says, \"that they served as a pastime\nto the king, and as an introduction to the royal ballet of Night,\ndivided into four parts and danced on the theatre of the Petit-Bourbon.\"\n\"Never,\" adds an eye witness of 1653, \"have the sudden metamorphoses of\nthe Court of Miracles been more happily presented. Benserade prepared us\nfor it by some very gallant verses.\"\n\nLoud laughter everywhere, and obscene songs. Each one held his own\ncourse, carping and swearing, without listening to his neighbor. Pots\nclinked, and quarrels sprang up at the shock of the pots, and the broken\npots made rents in the rags.\n\nA big dog, seated on his tail, gazed at the fire. Some children were\nmingled in this orgy. The stolen child wept and cried. Another, a big\nboy four years of age, seated with legs dangling, upon a bench that was\ntoo high for him, before a table that reached to his chin, and uttering\nnot a word. A third, gravely spreading out upon the table with his\nfinger, the melted tallow which dripped from a candle. Last of all, a\nlittle fellow crouching in the mud, almost lost in a cauldron, which\nhe was scraping with a tile, and from which he was evoking a sound that\nwould have made Stradivarius swoon.\n\nNear the fire was a hogshead, and on the hogshead a beggar. This was the\nking on his throne.\n\nThe three who had Gringoire in their clutches led him in front of this\nhogshead, and the entire bacchanal rout fell silent for a moment, with\nthe exception of the cauldron inhabited by the child.\n\nGringoire dared neither breathe nor raise his eyes.\n\n\"_Hombre, quita tu sombrero_!\" said one of the three knaves, in whose\ngrasp he was, and, before he had comprehended the meaning, the other had\nsnatched his hat--a wretched headgear, it is true, but still good on a\nsunny day or when there was but little rain. Gringoire sighed.\n\nMeanwhile the king addressed him, from the summit of his cask,--\n\n\"Who is this rogue?\"\n\nGringoire shuddered. That voice, although accentuated by menace,\nrecalled to him another voice, which, that very morning, had dealt the\ndeathblow to his mystery, by drawling, nasally, in the midst of the\naudience, \"Charity, please!\" He raised his head. It was indeed Clopin\nTrouillefou.\n\nClopin Trouillefou, arrayed in his royal insignia, wore neither one rag\nmore nor one rag less. The sore upon his arm had already disappeared.\nHe held in his hand one of those whips made of thongs of white leather,\nwhich police sergeants then used to repress the crowd, and which were\ncalled _boullayes_. On his head he wore a sort of headgear, bound round\nand closed at the top. But it was difficult to make out whether it was\na child's cap or a king's crown, the two things bore so strong a\nresemblance to each other.\n\nMeanwhile Gringoire, without knowing why, had regained some hope, on\nrecognizing in the King of the Cour des Miracles his accursed mendicant\nof the Grand Hall.\n\n\"Master,\" stammered he; \"monseigneur--sire--how ought I to address\nyou?\" he said at length, having reached the culminating point of his\ncrescendo, and knowing neither how to mount higher, nor to descend\nagain.\n\n\"Monseigneur, his majesty, or comrade, call me what you please. But make\nhaste. What have you to say in your own defence?\"\n\n\"In your own defence?\" thought Gringoire, \"that displeases me.\" He\nresumed, stuttering, \"I am he, who this morning--\"\n\n\"By the devil's claws!\" interrupted Clopin, \"your name, knave, and\nnothing more. Listen. You are in the presence of three powerful\nsovereigns: myself, Clopin Trouillefou, King of Thunes, successor to the\nGrand Co\u00c3\u00absre, supreme suzerain of the Realm of Argot; Mathias Hunyadi\nSpicali, Duke of Egypt and of Bohemia, the old yellow fellow whom\nyou see yonder, with a dish clout round his head; Guillaume Rousseau,\nEmperor of Galilee, that fat fellow who is not listening to us but\ncaressing a wench. We are your judges. You have entered the Kingdom of\nArgot, without being an _argotier_; you have violated the privileges of\nour city. You must be punished unless you are a _capon_, a _franc-mitou_\nor a _rifod\u00c3\u00a9_; that is to say, in the slang of honest folks,--a thief, a\nbeggar, or a vagabond. Are you anything of that sort? Justify yourself;\nannounce your titles.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Gringoire, \"I have not that honor. I am the author--\"\n\n\"That is sufficient,\" resumed Trouillefou, without permitting him\nto finish. \"You are going to be hanged. 'Tis a very simple matter,\ngentlemen and honest bourgeois! as you treat our people in your abode,\nso we treat you in ours! The law which you apply to vagabonds, vagabonds\napply to you. 'Tis your fault if it is harsh. One really must behold\nthe grimace of an honest man above the hempen collar now and then; that\nrenders the thing honorable. Come, friend, divide your rags gayly among\nthese damsels. I am going to have you hanged to amuse the vagabonds, and\nyou are to give them your purse to drink your health. If you have any\nmummery to go through with, there's a very good God the Father in that\nmortar yonder, in stone, which we stole from Saint-Pierre aux Boeufs.\nYou have four minutes in which to fling your soul at his head.\"\n\nThe harangue was formidable.\n\n\"Well said, upon my soul! Clopin Trouillefou preaches like the Holy\nFather the Pope!\" exclaimed the Emperor of Galilee, smashing his pot in\norder to prop up his table.\n\n\"Messeigneurs, emperors, and kings,\" said Gringoire coolly (for I know\nnot how, firmness had returned to him, and he spoke with resolution),\n\"don't think of such a thing; my name is Pierre Gringoire. I am the\npoet whose morality was presented this morning in the grand hall of the\nCourts.\"\n\n\"Ah! so it was you, master!\" said Clopin. \"I was there, _x\u00c3\u00aate Dieu_!\nWell! comrade, is that any reason, because you bored us to death this\nmorning, that you should not be hung this evening?\"\n\n\"I shall find difficulty in getting out of it,\" said Gringoire to\nhimself. Nevertheless, he made one more effort: \"I don't see why poets\nare not classed with vagabonds,\" said he. \"Vagabond, Aesopus certainly\nwas; Homerus was a beggar; Mercurius was a thief--\"\n\nClopin interrupted him: \"I believe that you are trying to blarney us\nwith your jargon. Zounds! let yourself be hung, and don't kick up such a\nrow over it!\"\n\n\"Pardon me, monseigneur, the King of Thunes,\" replied Gringoire,\ndisputing the ground foot by foot. \"It is worth trouble--One\nmoment!--Listen to me--You are not going to condemn me without having\nheard me\"--\n\nHis unlucky voice was, in fact, drowned in the uproar which rose around\nhim. The little boy scraped away at his cauldron with more spirit than\never; and, to crown all, an old woman had just placed on the tripod a\nfrying-pan of grease, which hissed away on the fire with a noise similar\nto the cry of a troop of children in pursuit of a masker.\n\nIn the meantime, Clopin Trouillefou appeared to hold a momentary\nconference with the Duke of Egypt, and the Emperor of Galilee, who\nwas completely drunk. Then he shouted shrilly: \"Silence!\" and, as the\ncauldron and the frying-pan did not heed him, and continued their duet,\nhe jumped down from his hogshead, gave a kick to the boiler, which\nrolled ten paces away bearing the child with it, a kick to the\nfrying-pan, which upset in the fire with all its grease, and gravely\nremounted his throne, without troubling himself about the stifled\ntears of the child, or the grumbling of the old woman, whose supper was\nwasting away in a fine white flame.\n\nTrouillefou made a sign, and the duke, the emperor, and the passed\nmasters of pickpockets, and the isolated robbers, came and ranged\nthemselves around him in a horseshoe, of which Gringoire, still roughly\nheld by the body, formed the centre. It was a semicircle of rags,\ntatters, tinsel, pitchforks, axes, legs staggering with intoxication,\nhuge, bare arms, faces sordid, dull, and stupid. In the midst of this\nRound Table of beggary, Clopin Trouillefou,--as the doge of this senate,\nas the king of this peerage, as the pope of this conclave,--dominated;\nfirst by virtue of the height of his hogshead, and next by virtue of\nan indescribable, haughty, fierce, and formidable air, which caused his\neyes to flash, and corrected in his savage profile the bestial type of\nthe race of vagabonds. One would have pronounced him a boar amid a herd\nof swine.\n\n\"Listen,\" said he to Gringoire, fondling his misshapen chin with his\nhorny hand; \"I don't see why you should not be hung. It is true that\nit appears to be repugnant to you; and it is very natural, for you\nbourgeois are not accustomed to it. You form for yourselves a great idea\nof the thing. After all, we don't wish you any harm. Here is a means\nof extricating yourself from your predicament for the moment. Will you\nbecome one of us?\"\n\nThe reader can judge of the effect which this proposition produced upon\nGringoire, who beheld life slipping away from him, and who was beginning\nto lose his hold upon it. He clutched at it again with energy.\n\n\"Certainly I will, and right heartily,\" said he.\n\n\"Do you consent,\" resumed Clopin, \"to enroll yourself among the people\nof the knife?\"\n\n\"Of the knife, precisely,\" responded Gringoire.\n\n\"You recognize yourself as a member of the free bourgeoisie?\"* added the\nKing of Thunes.\n\n\n     *  A high-toned sharper.\n\n\n\"Of the free bourgeoisie.\"\n\n\"Subject of the Kingdom of Argot?\"\n\n\"Of the Kingdom of Argot*.\"\n\n\n     *  Thieves.\n\n\n\"A vagabond?\"\n\n\"A vagabond.\"\n\n\"In your soul?\"\n\n\"In my soul.\"\n\n\"I must call your attention to the fact,\" continued the king, \"that you\nwill be hung all the same.\"\n\n\"The devil!\" said the poet.\n\n\"Only,\" continued Clopin imperturbably, \"you will be hung later on, with\nmore ceremony, at the expense of the good city of Paris, on a handsome\nstone gibbet, and by honest men. That is a consolation.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" responded Gringoire.\n\n\"There are other advantages. In your quality of a high-toned sharper,\nyou will not have to pay the taxes on mud, or the poor, or lanterns, to\nwhich the bourgeois of Paris are subject.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said the poet. \"I agree. I am a vagabond, a thief, a\nsharper, a man of the knife, anything you please; and I am all that\nalready, monsieur, King of Thunes, for I am a philosopher; _et omnia in\nphilosophia, omnes in philosopho continentur_,--all things are contained\nin philosophy, all men in the philosopher, as you know.\"\n\nThe King of Thunes scowled.\n\n\"What do you take me for, my friend? What Hungarian Jew patter are you\njabbering at us? I don't know Hebrew. One isn't a Jew because one is\na bandit. I don't even steal any longer. I'm above that; I kill.\nCut-throat, yes; cutpurse, no.\"\n\nGringoire tried to slip in some excuse between these curt words, which\nwrath rendered more and more jerky.\n\n\"I ask your pardon, monseigneur. It is not Hebrew; 'tis Latin.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" resumed Clopin angrily, \"that I'm not a Jew, and that I'll\nhave you hung, belly of the synagogue, like that little shopkeeper of\nJudea, who is by your side, and whom I entertain strong hopes of seeing\nnailed to a counter one of these days, like the counterfeit coin that he\nis!\"\n\nSo saying, he pointed his finger at the little, bearded Hungarian Jew\nwho had accosted Gringoire with his _facitote caritatem_, and who,\nunderstanding no other language beheld with surprise the King of\nThunes's ill-humor overflow upon him.\n\nAt length Monsieur Clopin calmed down.\n\n\"So you will be a vagabond, you knave?\" he said to our poet.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the poet.\n\n\"Willing is not all,\" said the surly Clopin; \"good will doesn't put one\nonion the more into the soup, and 'tis good for nothing except to go\nto Paradise with; now, Paradise and the thieves' band are two different\nthings. In order to be received among the thieves,* you must prove that\nyou are good for something, and for that purpose, you must search the\nmanikin.\"\n\n\n     * L'argot.\n\n\n\"I'll search anything you like,\" said Gringoire.\n\nClopin made a sign. Several thieves detached themselves from the circle,\nand returned a moment later. They brought two thick posts, terminated\nat their lower extremities in spreading timber supports, which made them\nstand readily upon the ground; to the upper extremity of the two posts\nthey fitted a cross-beam, and the whole constituted a very pretty\nportable gibbet, which Gringoire had the satisfaction of beholding rise\nbefore him, in a twinkling. Nothing was lacking, not even the rope,\nwhich swung gracefully over the cross-beam.\n\n\"What are they going to do?\" Gringoire asked himself with some\nuneasiness. A sound of bells, which he heard at that moment, put an\nend to his anxiety; it was a stuffed manikin, which the vagabonds were\nsuspending by the neck from the rope, a sort of scarecrow dressed in\nred, and so hung with mule-bells and larger bells, that one might have\ntricked out thirty Castilian mules with them. These thousand tiny bells\nquivered for some time with the vibration of the rope, then gradually\ndied away, and finally became silent when the manikin had been brought\ninto a state of immobility by that law of the pendulum which has\ndethroned the water clock and the hour-glass. Then Clopin, pointing out\nto Gringoire a rickety old stool placed beneath the manikin,--\"Climb up\nthere.\"\n\n\"Death of the devil!\" objected Gringoire; \"I shall break my neck. Your\nstool limps like one of Martial's distiches; it has one hexameter leg\nand one pentameter leg.\"\n\n\"Climb!\" repeated Clopin.\n\nGringoire mounted the stool, and succeeded, not without some\noscillations of head and arms, in regaining his centre of gravity.\n\n\"Now,\" went on the King of Thunes, \"twist your right foot round your\nleft leg, and rise on the tip of your left foot.\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Gringoire, \"so you absolutely insist on my breaking\nsome one of my limbs?\"\n\nClopin tossed his head.\n\n\"Hark ye, my friend, you talk too much. Here's the gist of the matter\nin two words: you are to rise on tiptoe, as I tell you; in that way you\nwill be able to reach the pocket of the manikin, you will rummage it,\nyou will pull out the purse that is there,--and if you do all this\nwithout our hearing the sound of a bell, all is well: you shall be a\nvagabond. All we shall then have to do, will be to thrash you soundly\nfor the space of a week.\"\n\n\"_Ventre-Dieu_! I will be careful,\" said Gringoire. \"And suppose I do\nmake the bells sound?\"\n\n\"Then you will be hanged. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"I don't understand at all,\" replied Gringoire.\n\n\"Listen, once more. You are to search the manikin, and take away its\npurse; if a single bell stirs during the operation, you will be hung. Do\nyou understand that?\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Gringoire; \"I understand that. And then?\"\n\n\"If you succeed in removing the purse without our hearing the bells, you\nare a vagabond, and you will be thrashed for eight consecutive days. You\nunderstand now, no doubt?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur; I no longer understand. Where is the advantage to me?\nhanged in one case, cudgelled in the other?\"\n\n\"And a vagabond,\" resumed Clopin, \"and a vagabond; is that nothing? It\nis for your interest that we should beat you, in order to harden you to\nblows.\"\n\n\"Many thanks,\" replied the poet.\n\n\"Come, make haste,\" said the king, stamping upon his cask, which\nresounded like a huge drum! \"Search the manikin, and let there be an end\nto this! I warn you for the last time, that if I hear a single bell, you\nwill take the place of the manikin.\"\n\nThe band of thieves applauded Clopin's words, and arranged themselves\nin a circle round the gibbet, with a laugh so pitiless that Gringoire\nperceived that he amused them too much not to have everything to fear\nfrom them. No hope was left for him, accordingly, unless it were the\nslight chance of succeeding in the formidable operation which was\nimposed upon him; he decided to risk it, but it was not without first\nhaving addressed a fervent prayer to the manikin he was about to\nplunder, and who would have been easier to move to pity than the\nvagabonds. These myriad bells, with their little copper tongues, seemed\nto him like the mouths of so many asps, open and ready to sting and to\nhiss.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said, in a very low voice, \"is it possible that my life depends\non the slightest vibration of the least of these bells? Oh!\" he added,\nwith clasped hands, \"bells, do not ring, hand-bells do not clang,\nmule-bells do not quiver!\"\n\nHe made one more attempt upon Trouillefou.\n\n\"And if there should come a gust of wind?\"\n\n\"You will be hanged,\" replied the other, without hesitation.\n\nPerceiving that no respite, nor reprieve, nor subterfuge was possible,\nhe bravely decided upon his course of action; he wound his right foot\nround his left leg, raised himself on his left foot, and stretched out\nhis arm: but at the moment when his hand touched the manikin, his body,\nwhich was now supported upon one leg only, wavered on the stool which\nhad but three; he made an involuntary effort to support himself by the\nmanikin, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened\nby the fatal vibration of the thousand bells of the manikin, which,\nyielding to the impulse imparted by his hand, described first a rotary\nmotion, and then swayed majestically between the two posts.\n\n\"Malediction!\" he cried as he fell, and remained as though dead, with\nhis face to the earth.\n\nMeanwhile, he heard the dreadful peal above his head, the diabolical\nlaughter of the vagabonds, and the voice of Trouillefou saying,--\n\n\"Pick me up that knave, and hang him without ceremony.\" He rose. They\nhad already detached the manikin to make room for him.\n\nThe thieves made him mount the stool, Clopin came to him, passed the\nrope about his neck, and, tapping him on the shoulder,--\n\n\"Adieu, my friend. You can't escape now, even if you digested with the\npope's guts.\"\n\nThe word \"Mercy!\" died away upon Gringoire's lips. He cast his eyes\nabout him; but there was no hope: all were laughing.\n\n\"Bellevigne de l'Etoile,\" said the King of Thunes to an enormous\nvagabond, who stepped out from the ranks, \"climb upon the cross beam.\"\n\nBellevigne de l'Etoile nimbly mounted the transverse beam, and in\nanother minute, Gringoire, on raising his eyes, beheld him, with terror,\nseated upon the beam above his head.\n\n\"Now,\" resumed Clopin Trouillefou, \"as soon as I clap my hands, you,\nAndry the Red, will fling the stool to the ground with a blow of your\nknee; you, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Chante-Prune, will cling to the feet of the rascal;\nand you, Bellevigne, will fling yourself on his shoulders; and all three\nat once, do you hear?\"\n\nGringoire shuddered.\n\n\"Are you ready?\" said Clopin Trouillefou to the three thieves, who held\nthemselves in readiness to fall upon Gringoire. A moment of horrible\nsuspense ensued for the poor victim, during which Clopin tranquilly\nthrust into the fire with the tip of his foot, some bits of vine shoots\nwhich the flame had not caught. \"Are you ready?\" he repeated, and opened\nhis hands to clap. One second more and all would have been over.\n\nBut he paused, as though struck by a sudden thought.\n\n\"One moment!\" said he; \"I forgot! It is our custom not to hang a man\nwithout inquiring whether there is any woman who wants him. Comrade,\nthis is your last resource. You must wed either a female vagabond or the\nnoose.\"\n\nThis law of the vagabonds, singular as it may strike the reader, remains\nto-day written out at length, in ancient English legislation. (See\n_Burington's Observations_.)\n\nGringoire breathed again. This was the second time that he had\nreturned to life within an hour. So he did not dare to trust to it too\nimplicitly.\n\n\"Hol\u00c3\u00a0!\" cried Clopin, mounted once more upon his cask, \"hol\u00c3\u00a0! women,\nfemales, is there among you, from the sorceress to her cat, a wench who\nwants this rascal? Hol\u00c3\u00a0, Colette la Charonne! Elisabeth Trouvain! Simone\nJodouyne! Marie Pi\u00c3\u00a9debou! Thonne la Longue! B\u00c3\u00a9rarde Fanouel!\nMichelle Genaille! Claude Ronge-oreille! Mathurine Girorou!--Hol\u00c3\u00a0!\nIsabeau-la-Thierrye! Come and see! A man for nothing! Who wants him?\"\n\nGringoire, no doubt, was not very appetizing in this miserable\ncondition. The female vagabonds did not seem to be much affected by the\nproposition. The unhappy wretch heard them answer: \"No! no! hang him;\nthere'll be the more fun for us all!\"\n\nNevertheless, three emerged from the throng and came to smell of\nhim. The first was a big wench, with a square face. She examined the\nphilosopher's deplorable doublet attentively. His garment was worn, and\nmore full of holes than a stove for roasting chestnuts. The girl made a\nwry face. \"Old rag!\" she muttered, and addressing Gringoire, \"Let's see\nyour cloak!\" \"I have lost it,\" replied Gringoire. \"Your hat?\" \"They took\nit away from me.\" \"Your shoes?\" \"They have hardly any soles left.\" \"Your\npurse?\" \"Alas!\" stammered Gringoire, \"I have not even a sou.\" \"Let\nthem hang you, then, and say 'Thank you!'\" retorted the vagabond wench,\nturning her back on him.\n\nThe second,--old, black, wrinkled, hideous, with an ugliness conspicuous\neven in the Cour des Miracles, trotted round Gringoire. He almost\ntrembled lest she should want him. But she mumbled between her teeth,\n\"He's too thin,\" and went off.\n\nThe third was a young girl, quite fresh, and not too ugly. \"Save me!\"\nsaid the poor fellow to her, in a low tone. She gazed at him for a\nmoment with an air of pity, then dropped her eyes, made a plait in her\npetticoat, and remained in indecision. He followed all these movements\nwith his eyes; it was the last gleam of hope. \"No,\" said the young girl,\nat length, \"no! Guillaume Longuejoue would beat me.\" She retreated into\nthe crowd.\n\n\"You are unlucky, comrade,\" said Clopin.\n\nThen rising to his feet, upon his hogshead. \"No one wants him,\" he\nexclaimed, imitating the accent of an auctioneer, to the great delight\nof all; \"no one wants him? once, twice, three times!\" and, turning\ntowards the gibbet with a sign of his hand, \"Gone!\"\n\nBellevigne de l'Etoile, Andry the Red, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Chante-Prune, stepped up\nto Gringoire.\n\nAt that moment a cry arose among the thieves: \"La Esmeralda! La\nEsmeralda!\"\n\nGringoire shuddered, and turned towards the side whence the clamor\nproceeded.\n\nThe crowd opened, and gave passage to a pure and dazzling form.\n\nIt was the gypsy.\n\n\"La Esmeralda!\" said Gringoire, stupefied in the midst of his emotions,\nby the abrupt manner in which that magic word knotted together all his\nreminiscences of the day.\n\nThis rare creature seemed, even in the Cour des Miracles, to exercise\nher sway of charm and beauty. The vagabonds, male and female, ranged\nthemselves gently along her path, and their brutal faces beamed beneath\nher glance.\n\nShe approached the victim with her light step. Her pretty Djali followed\nher. Gringoire was more dead than alive. She examined him for a moment\nin silence.\n\n\"You are going to hang this man?\" she said gravely, to Clopin.\n\n\"Yes, sister,\" replied the King of Thunes, \"unless you will take him for\nyour husband.\"\n\nShe made her pretty little pout with her under lip. \"I'll take him,\"\nsaid she.\n\nGringoire firmly believed that he had been in a dream ever since\nmorning, and that this was the continuation of it.\n\nThe change was, in fact, violent, though a gratifying one. They undid\nthe noose, and made the poet step down from the stool. His emotion was\nso lively that he was obliged to sit down.\n\nThe Duke of Egypt brought an earthenware crock, without uttering a word.\nThe gypsy offered it to Gringoire: \"Fling it on the ground,\" said she.\n\nThe crock broke into four pieces.\n\n\"Brother,\" then said the Duke of Egypt, laying his hands upon their\nforeheads, \"she is your wife; sister, he is your husband for four years.\nGo.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. A BRIDAL NIGHT.\n\n\n\nA few moments later our poet found himself in a tiny arched chamber,\nvery cosy, very warm, seated at a table which appeared to ask nothing\nbetter than to make some loans from a larder hanging near by, having\na good bed in prospect, and alone with a pretty girl. The adventure\nsmacked of enchantment. He began seriously to take himself for a\npersonage in a fairy tale; he cast his eyes about him from time to\ntime to time, as though to see if the chariot of fire, harnessed to\ntwo-winged chimeras, which alone could have so rapidly transported him\nfrom Tartarus to Paradise, were still there. At times, also, he fixed\nhis eyes obstinately upon the holes in his doublet, in order to cling\nto reality, and not lose the ground from under his feet completely. His\nreason, tossed about in imaginary space, now hung only by this thread.\n\nThe young girl did not appear to pay any attention to him; she went and\ncame, displaced a stool, talked to her goat, and indulged in a pout\nnow and then. At last she came and seated herself near the table, and\nGringoire was able to scrutinize her at his ease.\n\nYou have been a child, reader, and you would, perhaps, be very happy to\nbe one still. It is quite certain that you have not, more than once (and\nfor my part, I have passed whole days, the best employed of my life, at\nit) followed from thicket to thicket, by the side of running water, on a\nsunny day, a beautiful green or blue dragon-fly, breaking its flight in\nabrupt angles, and kissing the tips of all the branches. You recollect\nwith what amorous curiosity your thought and your gaze were riveted\nupon this little whirlwind, hissing and humming with wings of purple and\nazure, in the midst of which floated an imperceptible body, veiled by\nthe very rapidity of its movement. The aerial being which was dimly\noutlined amid this quivering of wings, appeared to you chimerical,\nimaginary, impossible to touch, impossible to see. But when, at length,\nthe dragon-fly alighted on the tip of a reed, and, holding your breath\nthe while, you were able to examine the long, gauze wings, the long\nenamel robe, the two globes of crystal, what astonishment you felt, and\nwhat fear lest you should again behold the form disappear into a shade,\nand the creature into a chimera! Recall these impressions, and you will\nreadily appreciate what Gringoire felt on contemplating, beneath her\nvisible and palpable form, that Esmeralda of whom, up to that time,\nhe had only caught a glimpse, amidst a whirlwind of dance, song, and\ntumult.\n\nSinking deeper and deeper into his revery: \"So this,\" he said to\nhimself, following her vaguely with his eyes, \"is la Esmeralda! a\ncelestial creature! a street dancer! so much, and so little! 'Twas she\nwho dealt the death-blow to my mystery this morning, 'tis she who saves\nmy life this evening! My evil genius! My good angel! A pretty woman,\non my word! and who must needs love me madly to have taken me in that\nfashion. By the way,\" said he, rising suddenly, with that sentiment\nof the true which formed the foundation of his character and his\nphilosophy, \"I don't know very well how it happens, but I am her\nhusband!\"\n\nWith this idea in his head and in his eyes, he stepped up to the young\ngirl in a manner so military and so gallant that she drew back.\n\n\"What do you want of me?\" said she.\n\n\"Can you ask me, adorable Esmeralda?\" replied Gringoire, with so\npassionate an accent that he was himself astonished at it on hearing\nhimself speak.\n\nThe gypsy opened her great eyes. \"I don't know what you mean.\"\n\n\"What!\" resumed Gringoire, growing warmer and warmer, and supposing\nthat, after all, he had to deal merely with a virtue of the Cour des\nMiracles; \"am I not thine, sweet friend, art thou not mine?\"\n\nAnd, quite ingenuously, he clasped her waist.\n\nThe gypsy's corsage slipped through his hands like the skin of an eel.\nShe bounded from one end of the tiny room to the other, stooped down,\nand raised herself again, with a little poniard in her hand, before\nGringoire had even had time to see whence the poniard came; proud and\nangry, with swelling lips and inflated nostrils, her cheeks as red as an\napi apple,* and her eyes darting lightnings. At the same time, the white\ngoat placed itself in front of her, and presented to Gringoire a hostile\nfront, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp. All this\ntook place in the twinkling of an eye.\n\n\n     *  A small dessert apple, bright red on one side and\n     greenish-white on the other.\n\n\nThe dragon-fly had turned into a wasp, and asked nothing better than to\nsting.\n\nOur philosopher was speechless, and turned his astonished eyes from the\ngoat to the young girl. \"Holy Virgin!\" he said at last, when surprise\npermitted him to speak, \"here are two hearty dames!\"\n\nThe gypsy broke the silence on her side.\n\n\"You must be a very bold knave!\"\n\n\"Pardon, mademoiselle,\" said Gringoire, with a smile. \"But why did you\ntake me for your husband?\"\n\n\"Should I have allowed you to be hanged?\"\n\n\"So,\" said the poet, somewhat disappointed in his amorous hopes. \"You\nhad no other idea in marrying me than to save me from the gibbet?\"\n\n\"And what other idea did you suppose that I had?\"\n\nGringoire bit his lips. \"Come,\" said he, \"I am not yet so triumphant in\nCupido, as I thought. But then, what was the good of breaking that poor\njug?\"\n\nMeanwhile Esmeralda's dagger and the goat's horns were still upon the\ndefensive.\n\n\"Mademoiselle Esmeralda,\" said the poet, \"let us come to terms. I am\nnot a clerk of the court, and I shall not go to law with you for\nthus carrying a dagger in Paris, in the teeth of the ordinances and\nprohibitions of M. the Provost. Nevertheless, you are not ignorant of\nthe fact that Noel Lescrivain was condemned, a week ago, to pay ten\nParisian sous, for having carried a cutlass. But this is no affair of\nmine, and I will come to the point. I swear to you, upon my share of\nParadise, not to approach you without your leave and permission, but do\ngive me some supper.\"\n\nThe truth is, Gringoire was, like M. Despreaux, \"not very voluptuous.\"\nHe did not belong to that chevalier and musketeer species, who take\nyoung girls by assault. In the matter of love, as in all other affairs,\nhe willingly assented to temporizing and adjusting terms; and a good\nsupper, and an amiable t\u00c3\u00aate-a-t\u00c3\u00aate appeared to him, especially when\nhe was hungry, an excellent interlude between the prologue and the\ncatastrophe of a love adventure.\n\nThe gypsy did not reply. She made her disdainful little grimace, drew\nup her head like a bird, then burst out laughing, and the tiny poniard\ndisappeared as it had come, without Gringoire being able to see where\nthe wasp concealed its sting.\n\nA moment later, there stood upon the table a loaf of rye bread, a slice\nof bacon, some wrinkled apples and a jug of beer. Gringoire began to eat\neagerly. One would have said, to hear the furious clashing of his\niron fork and his earthenware plate, that all his love had turned to\nappetite.\n\nThe young girl seated opposite him, watched him in silence, visibly\npreoccupied with another thought, at which she smiled from time to time,\nwhile her soft hand caressed the intelligent head of the goat, gently\npressed between her knees.\n\nA candle of yellow wax illuminated this scene of voracity and revery.\n\nMeanwhile, the first cravings of his stomach having been stilled,\nGringoire felt some false shame at perceiving that nothing remained but\none apple.\n\n\"You do not eat, Mademoiselle Esmeralda?\"\n\nShe replied by a negative sign of the head, and her pensive glance fixed\nitself upon the vault of the ceiling.\n\n\"What the deuce is she thinking of?\" thought Gringoire, staring at what\nshe was gazing at; \"'tis impossible that it can be that stone dwarf\ncarved in the keystone of that arch, which thus absorbs her attention.\nWhat the deuce! I can bear the comparison!\"\n\nHe raised his voice, \"Mademoiselle!\"\n\nShe seemed not to hear him.\n\nHe repeated, still more loudly, \"Mademoiselle Esmeralda!\"\n\nTrouble wasted. The young girl's mind was elsewhere, and Gringoire's\nvoice had not the power to recall it. Fortunately, the goat interfered.\nShe began to pull her mistress gently by the sleeve.\n\n\"What dost thou want, Djali?\" said the gypsy, hastily, as though\nsuddenly awakened.\n\n\"She is hungry,\" said Gringoire, charmed to enter into conversation.\nEsmeralda began to crumble some bread, which Djali ate gracefully from\nthe hollow of her hand.\n\nMoreover, Gringoire did not give her time to resume her revery. He\nhazarded a delicate question.\n\n\"So you don't want me for your husband?\"\n\nThe young girl looked at him intently, and said, \"No.\"\n\n\"For your lover?\" went on Gringoire.\n\nShe pouted, and replied, \"No.\"\n\n\"For your friend?\" pursued Gringoire.\n\nShe gazed fixedly at him again, and said, after a momentary reflection,\n\"Perhaps.\"\n\nThis \"perhaps,\" so dear to philosophers, emboldened Gringoire.\n\n\"Do you know what friendship is?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the gypsy; \"it is to be brother and sister; two souls\nwhich touch without mingling, two fingers on one hand.\"\n\n\"And love?\" pursued Gringoire.\n\n\"Oh! love!\" said she, and her voice trembled, and her eye beamed. \"That\nis to be two and to be but one. A man and a woman mingled into one\nangel. It is heaven.\"\n\nThe street dancer had a beauty as she spoke thus, that struck Gringoire\nsingularly, and seemed to him in perfect keeping with the almost\noriental exaltation of her words. Her pure, red lips half smiled;\nher serene and candid brow became troubled, at intervals, under her\nthoughts, like a mirror under the breath; and from beneath her long,\ndrooping, black eyelashes, there escaped a sort of ineffable light,\nwhich gave to her profile that ideal serenity which Raphael found at the\nmystic point of intersection of virginity, maternity, and divinity.\n\nNevertheless, Gringoire continued,--\n\n\"What must one be then, in order to please you?\"\n\n\"A man.\"\n\n\"And I--\" said he, \"what, then, am I?\"\n\n\"A man has a hemlet on his head, a sword in his hand, and golden spurs\non his heels.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Gringoire, \"without a horse, no man. Do you love any one?\"\n\n\"As a lover?--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe remained thoughtful for a moment, then said with a peculiar\nexpression: \"That I shall know soon.\"\n\n\"Why not this evening?\" resumed the poet tenderly. \"Why not me?\"\n\nShe cast a grave glance upon him and said,--\n\n\"I can never love a man who cannot protect me.\"\n\nGringoire colored, and took the hint. It was evident that the young girl\nwas alluding to the slight assistance which he had rendered her in the\ncritical situation in which she had found herself two hours previously.\nThis memory, effaced by his own adventures of the evening, now recurred\nto him. He smote his brow.\n\n\"By the way, mademoiselle, I ought to have begun there. Pardon my\nfoolish absence of mind. How did you contrive to escape from the claws\nof Quasimodo?\"\n\nThis question made the gypsy shudder.\n\n\"Oh! the horrible hunchback,\" said she, hiding her face in her hands.\nAnd she shuddered as though with violent cold.\n\n\"Horrible, in truth,\" said Gringoire, who clung to his idea; \"but how\ndid you manage to escape him?\"\n\nLa Esmeralda smiled, sighed, and remained silent.\n\n\"Do you know why he followed you?\" began Gringoire again, seeking to\nreturn to his question by a circuitous route.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the young girl, and she added hastily, \"but you\nwere following me also, why were you following me?\"\n\n\"In good faith,\" responded Gringoire, \"I don't know either.\"\n\nSilence ensued. Gringoire slashed the table with his knife. The young\ngirl smiled and seemed to be gazing through the wall at something. All\nat once she began to sing in a barely articulate voice,--\n\n\n   _Quando las pintadas aves,\n   Mudas estan, y la tierra_--*\n\n\n     *  When the gay-plumaged birds grow weary, and the earth--\n\n\nShe broke off abruptly, and began to caress Djali.\n\n\"That's a pretty animal of yours,\" said Gringoire.\n\n\"She is my sister,\" she answered.\n\n\"Why are you called 'la Esmeralda?'\" asked the poet.\n\n\"I do not know.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nShe drew from her bosom a sort of little oblong bag, suspended from her\nneck by a string of adr\u00c3\u00a9zarach beads. This bag exhaled a strong odor of\ncamphor. It was covered with green silk, and bore in its centre a large\npiece of green glass, in imitation of an emerald.\n\n\"Perhaps it is because of this,\" said she.\n\nGringoire was on the point of taking the bag in his hand. She drew back.\n\n\"Don't touch it! It is an amulet. You would injure the charm or the\ncharm would injure you.\"\n\nThe poet's curiosity was more and more aroused.\n\n\"Who gave it to you?\"\n\nShe laid one finger on her mouth and concealed the amulet in her bosom.\nHe tried a few more questions, but she hardly replied.\n\n\"What is the meaning of the words, 'la Esmeralda?'\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said she.\n\n\"To what language do they belong?\"\n\n\"They are Egyptian, I think.\"\n\n\"I suspected as much,\" said Gringoire, \"you are not a native of France?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Are your parents alive?\"\n\nShe began to sing, to an ancient air,--\n\n _Mon p\u00c3\u00a8re est oiseau,\n  Ma m\u00c3\u00a8re est oiselle.\n  Je passe l'eau sans nacelle,\n  Je passe l'eau sans bateau,\n  Ma m\u00c3\u00a8re est oiselle,\n  Mon p\u00c3\u00a8re est oiseau_.*\n\n\n     *  My father is a bird, my mother is a bird.  I cross the\nwater without a barque, I cross the water without a boat. My mother is a\nbird, my father is a bird.\n\n\n\"Good,\" said Gringoire. \"At what age did you come to France?\"\n\n\"When I was very young.\"\n\n\"And when to Paris?\"\n\n\"Last year. At the moment when we were entering the papal gate I saw\na reed warbler flit through the air, that was at the end of August; I\nsaid, it will be a hard winter.\"\n\n\"So it was,\" said Gringoire, delighted at this beginning of a\nconversation. \"I passed it in blowing my fingers. So you have the gift\nof prophecy?\"\n\nShe retired into her laconics again.\n\n\"Is that man whom you call the Duke of Egypt, the chief of your tribe?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But it was he who married us,\" remarked the poet timidly.\n\nShe made her customary pretty grimace.\n\n\"I don't even know your name.\"\n\n\"My name? If you want it, here it is,--Pierre Gringoire.\"\n\n\"I know a prettier one,\" said she.\n\n\"Naughty girl!\" retorted the poet. \"Never mind, you shall not provoke\nme. Wait, perhaps you will love me more when you know me better; and\nthen, you have told me your story with so much confidence, that I\nowe you a little of mine. You must know, then, that my name is Pierre\nGringoire, and that I am a son of the farmer of the notary's office\nof Gonesse. My father was hung by the Burgundians, and my mother\ndisembowelled by the Picards, at the siege of Paris, twenty years ago.\nAt six years of age, therefore, I was an orphan, without a sole to\nmy foot except the pavements of Paris. I do not know how I passed the\ninterval from six to sixteen. A fruit dealer gave me a plum here, a\nbaker flung me a crust there; in the evening I got myself taken up\nby the watch, who threw me into prison, and there I found a bundle of\nstraw. All this did not prevent my growing up and growing thin, as you\nsee. In the winter I warmed myself in the sun, under the porch of the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel de Sens, and I thought it very ridiculous that the fire on Saint\nJohn's Day was reserved for the dog days. At sixteen, I wished to choose\na calling. I tried all in succession. I became a soldier; but I was not\nbrave enough. I became a monk; but I was not sufficiently devout; and\nthen I'm a bad hand at drinking. In despair, I became an apprentice\nof the woodcutters, but I was not strong enough; I had more of an\ninclination to become a schoolmaster; 'tis true that I did not know how\nto read, but that's no reason. I perceived at the end of a certain time,\nthat I lacked something in every direction; and seeing that I was good\nfor nothing, of my own free will I became a poet and rhymester. That\nis a trade which one can always adopt when one is a vagabond, and it's\nbetter than stealing, as some young brigands of my acquaintance advised\nme to do. One day I met by luck, Dom Claude Frollo, the reverend\narchdeacon of Notre-Dame. He took an interest in me, and it is to him\nthat I to-day owe it that I am a veritable man of letters, who knows\nLatin from the _de Officiis_ of Cicero to the mortuology of the\nCelestine Fathers, and a barbarian neither in scholastics, nor in\npolitics, nor in rhythmics, that sophism of sophisms. I am the author\nof the Mystery which was presented to-day with great triumph and a great\nconcourse of populace, in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice.\nI have also made a book which will contain six hundred pages, on the\nwonderful comet of 1465, which sent one man mad. I have enjoyed still\nother successes. Being somewhat of an artillery carpenter, I lent a hand\nto Jean Mangue's great bombard, which burst, as you know, on the day\nwhen it was tested, on the Pont de Charenton, and killed four and twenty\ncurious spectators. You see that I am not a bad match in marriage. I\nknow a great many sorts of very engaging tricks, which I will teach your\ngoat; for example, to mimic the Bishop of Paris, that cursed Pharisee\nwhose mill wheels splash passers-by the whole length of the Pont aux\nMeuniers. And then my mystery will bring me in a great deal of coined\nmoney, if they will only pay me. And finally, I am at your orders, I and\nmy wits, and my science and my letters, ready to live with you, damsel,\nas it shall please you, chastely or joyously; husband and wife, if you\nsee fit; brother and sister, if you think that better.\"\n\nGringoire ceased, awaiting the effect of his harangue on the young girl.\nHer eyes were fixed on the ground.\n\n\"'Phoebus,'\" she said in a low voice. Then, turning towards the poet,\n\"'Phoebus',--what does that mean?\"\n\nGringoire, without exactly understanding what the connection could be\nbetween his address and this question, was not sorry to display his\nerudition. Assuming an air of importance, he replied,--\n\n\"It is a Latin word which means 'sun.'\"\n\n\"Sun!\" she repeated.\n\n\"It is the name of a handsome archer, who was a god,\" added Gringoire.\n\n\"A god!\" repeated the gypsy, and there was something pensive and\npassionate in her tone.\n\nAt that moment, one of her bracelets became unfastened and fell.\nGringoire stooped quickly to pick it up; when he straightened up, the\nyoung girl and the goat had disappeared. He heard the sound of a bolt.\nIt was a little door, communicating, no doubt, with a neighboring cell,\nwhich was being fastened on the outside.\n\n\"Has she left me a bed, at least?\" said our philosopher.\n\nHe made the tour of his cell. There was no piece of furniture adapted to\nsleeping purposes, except a tolerably long wooden coffer; and its cover\nwas carved, to boot; which afforded Gringoire, when he stretched himself\nout upon it, a sensation somewhat similar to that which Microm\u00c3\u00a9gas would\nfeel if he were to lie down on the Alps.\n\n\"Come!\" said he, adjusting himself as well as possible, \"I must resign\nmyself. But here's a strange nuptial night. 'Tis a pity. There was\nsomething innocent and antediluvian about that broken crock, which quite\npleased me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. NOTRE-DAME.\n\n\n\nThe church of Notre-Dame de Paris is still no doubt, a majestic and\nsublime edifice. But, beautiful as it has been preserved in growing old,\nit is difficult not to sigh, not to wax indignant, before the numberless\ndegradations and mutilations which time and men have both caused the\nvenerable monument to suffer, without respect for Charlemagne, who laid\nits first stone, or for Philip Augustus, who laid the last.\n\nOn the face of this aged queen of our cathedrals, by the side of a\nwrinkle, one always finds a scar. _Tempus edax, homo edacior*_; which I\nshould be glad to translate thus: time is blind, man is stupid.\n\n\n     *  Time is a devourer; man, more so.\n\n\nIf we had leisure to examine with the reader, one by one, the diverse\ntraces of destruction imprinted upon the old church, time's share would\nbe the least, the share of men the most, especially the men of art,\nsince there have been individuals who assumed the title of architects\nduring the last two centuries.\n\nAnd, in the first place, to cite only a few leading examples, there\ncertainly are few finer architectural pages than this fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, where,\nsuccessively and at once, the three portals hollowed out in an arch; the\nbroidered and dentated cordon of the eight and twenty royal niches; the\nimmense central rose window, flanked by its two lateral windows, like\na priest by his deacon and subdeacon; the frail and lofty gallery of\ntrefoil arcades, which supports a heavy platform above its fine, slender\ncolumns; and lastly, the two black and massive towers with their slate\npenthouses, harmonious parts of a magnificent whole, superposed in five\ngigantic stories;--develop themselves before the eye, in a mass and\nwithout confusion, with their innumerable details of statuary, carving,\nand sculpture, joined powerfully to the tranquil grandeur of the whole;\na vast symphony in stone, so to speak; the colossal work of one man\nand one people, all together one and complex, like the Iliads and the\nRomanceros, whose sister it is; prodigious product of the grouping\ntogether of all the forces of an epoch, where, upon each stone, one sees\nthe fancy of the workman disciplined by the genius of the artist start\nforth in a hundred fashions; a sort of human creation, in a word,\npowerful and fecund as the divine creation of which it seems to have\nstolen the double character,--variety, eternity.\n\nAnd what we here say of the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade must be said of the entire church;\nand what we say of the cathedral church of Paris, must be said of all\nthe churches of Christendom in the Middle Ages. All things are in place\nin that art, self-created, logical, and well proportioned. To measure\nthe great toe of the foot is to measure the giant.\n\nLet us return to the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of Notre-Dame, as it still appears to us,\nwhen we go piously to admire the grave and puissant cathedral, which\ninspires terror, so its chronicles assert: _qu\u00c3\u00a6 mole sua terrorem\nincutit spectantibus_.\n\nThree important things are to-day lacking in that fa\u00c3\u00a7ade: in the first\nplace, the staircase of eleven steps which formerly raised it above the\nsoil; next, the lower series of statues which occupied the niches of\nthe three portals; and lastly the upper series, of the twenty-eight most\nancient kings of France, which garnished the gallery of the first story,\nbeginning with Childebert, and ending with Phillip Augustus, holding in\nhis hand \"the imperial apple.\"\n\nTime has caused the staircase to disappear, by raising the soil of the\ncity with a slow and irresistible progress; but, while thus causing the\neleven steps which added to the majestic height of the edifice, to\nbe devoured, one by one, by the rising tide of the pavements of\nParis,--time has bestowed upon the church perhaps more than it has taken\naway, for it is time which has spread over the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that sombre hue of\nthe centuries which makes the old age of monuments the period of their\nbeauty.\n\nBut who has thrown down the two rows of statues? who has left the niches\nempty? who has cut, in the very middle of the central portal, that new\nand bastard arch? who has dared to frame therein that commonplace and\nheavy door of carved wood, \u00c3\u00a0 la Louis XV., beside the arabesques of\nBiscornette? The men, the architects, the artists of our day.\n\nAnd if we enter the interior of the edifice, who has overthrown that\ncolossus of Saint Christopher, proverbial for magnitude among statues,\nas the grand hall of the Palais de Justice was among halls, as the spire\nof Strasbourg among spires? And those myriads of statues, which peopled\nall the spaces between the columns of the nave and the choir, kneeling,\nstanding, equestrian, men, women, children, kings, bishops, gendarmes,\nin stone, in marble, in gold, in silver, in copper, in wax even,--who\nhas brutally swept them away? It is not time.\n\nAnd who substituted for the ancient gothic altar, splendidly encumbered\nwith shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with\nangels' heads and clouds, which seems a specimen pillaged from\nthe Val-de-Gr\u00c3\u00a2ce or the Invalides? Who stupidly sealed that heavy\nanachronism of stone in the Carlovingian pavement of Hercandus? Was it\nnot Louis XIV., fulfilling the request of Louis XIII.?\n\nAnd who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows, \"high\nin color,\" which caused the astonished eyes of our fathers to hesitate\nbetween the rose of the grand portal and the arches of the apse? And\nwhat would a sub-chanter of the sixteenth century say, on beholding\nthe beautiful yellow wash, with which our archiepiscopal vandals have\ndesmeared their cathedral? He would remember that it was the color with\nwhich the hangman smeared \"accursed\" edifices; he would recall the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel du Petit-Bourbon, all smeared thus, on account of the constable's\ntreason. \"Yellow, after all, of so good a quality,\" said Sauval, \"and so\nwell recommended, that more than a century has not yet caused it to lose\nits color.\" He would think that the sacred place had become infamous,\nand would flee.\n\nAnd if we ascend the cathedral, without mentioning a thousand barbarisms\nof every sort,--what has become of that charming little bell tower,\nwhich rested upon the point of intersection of the cross-roofs,\nand which, no less frail and no less bold than its neighbor (also\ndestroyed), the spire of the Sainte-Chapelle, buried itself in the sky,\nfarther forward than the towers, slender, pointed, sonorous, carved\nin open work. An architect of good taste amputated it (1787), and\nconsidered it sufficient to mask the wound with that large, leaden\nplaster, which resembles a pot cover.\n\n'Tis thus that the marvellous art of the Middle Ages has been treated in\nnearly every country, especially in France. One can distinguish on\nits ruins three sorts of lesions, all three of which cut into it at\ndifferent depths; first, time, which has insensibly notched its surface\nhere and there, and gnawed it everywhere; next, political and religious\nrevolution, which, blind and wrathful by nature, have flung themselves\ntumultuously upon it, torn its rich garment of carving and sculpture,\nburst its rose windows, broken its necklace of arabesques and tiny\nfigures, torn out its statues, sometimes because of their mitres,\nsometimes because of their crowns; lastly, fashions, even more grotesque\nand foolish, which, since the anarchical and splendid deviations of\nthe Renaissance, have followed each other in the necessary decadence\nof architecture. Fashions have wrought more harm than revolutions. They\nhave cut to the quick; they have attacked the very bone and framework of\nart; they have cut, slashed, disorganized, killed the edifice, in form\nas in the symbol, in its consistency as well as in its beauty. And\nthen they have made it over; a presumption of which neither time nor\nrevolutions at least have been guilty. They have audaciously adjusted,\nin the name of \"good taste,\" upon the wounds of gothic architecture,\ntheir miserable gewgaws of a day, their ribbons of marble, their pompons\nof metal, a veritable leprosy of egg-shaped ornaments, volutes, whorls,\ndraperies, garlands, fringes, stone flames, bronze clouds, pudgy cupids,\nchubby-cheeked cherubim, which begin to devour the face of art in the\noratory of Catherine de Medicis, and cause it to expire, two centuries\nlater, tortured and grimacing, in the boudoir of the Dubarry.\n\nThus, to sum up the points which we have just indicated, three sorts of\nravages to-day disfigure Gothic architecture. Wrinkles and warts on the\nepidermis; this is the work of time. Deeds of violence, brutalities,\ncontusions, fractures; this is the work of the revolutions from Luther\nto Mirabeau. Mutilations, amputations, dislocation of the joints,\n\"restorations\"; this is the Greek, Roman, and barbarian work of\nprofessors according to Vitruvius and Vignole. This magnificent art\nproduced by the Vandals has been slain by the academies. The centuries,\nthe revolutions, which at least devastate with impartiality and\ngrandeur, have been joined by a cloud of school architects, licensed,\nsworn, and bound by oath; defacing with the discernment and choice of\nbad taste, substituting the _chicor\u00c3\u00a9es_ of Louis XV. for the Gothic\nlace, for the greater glory of the Parthenon. It is the kick of the ass\nat the dying lion. It is the old oak crowning itself, and which, to heap\nthe measure full, is stung, bitten, and gnawed by caterpillars.\n\nHow far it is from the epoch when Robert Cenalis, comparing Notre-Dame\nde Paris to the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus, *so much lauded\nby the ancient pagans*, which Erostatus *has* immortalized, found\nthe Gallic temple \"more excellent in length, breadth, height, and\nstructure.\"*\n\n\n     *  _Histoire Gallicane_, liv. II. Periode III. fo. 130, p. 1.\n\n\nNotre-Dame is not, moreover, what can be called a complete, definite,\nclassified monument. It is no longer a Romanesque church; nor is it a\nGothic church. This edifice is not a type. Notre-Dame de Paris has not,\nlike the Abbey of Tournus, the grave and massive frame, the large\nand round vault, the glacial bareness, the majestic simplicity of the\nedifices which have the rounded arch for their progenitor. It is not,\nlike the Cathedral of Bourges, the magnificent, light, multiform,\ntufted, bristling efflorescent product of the pointed arch. Impossible\nto class it in that ancient family of sombre, mysterious churches, low\nand crushed as it were by the round arch, almost Egyptian, with the\nexception of the ceiling; all hieroglyphics, all sacerdotal, all\nsymbolical, more loaded in their ornaments, with lozenges and zigzags,\nthan with flowers, with flowers than with animals, with animals than\nwith men; the work of the architect less than of the bishop; first\ntransformation of art, all impressed with theocratic and military\ndiscipline, taking root in the Lower Empire, and stopping with the time\nof William the Conqueror. Impossible to place our Cathedral in that\nother family of lofty, aerial churches, rich in painted windows and\nsculpture; pointed in form, bold in attitude; communal and bourgeois as\npolitical symbols; free, capricious, lawless, as a work of art; second\ntransformation of architecture, no longer hieroglyphic, immovable and\nsacerdotal, but artistic, progressive, and popular, which begins at the\nreturn from the crusades, and ends with Louis IX. Notre-Dame de Paris is\nnot of pure Romanesque, like the first; nor of pure Arabian race, like\nthe second.\n\nIt is an edifice of the transition period. The Saxon architect completed\nthe erection of the first pillars of the nave, when the pointed arch,\nwhich dates from the Crusade, arrived and placed itself as a conqueror\nupon the large Romanesque capitals which should support only round\narches. The pointed arch, mistress since that time, constructed the rest\nof the church. Nevertheless, timid and inexperienced at the start, it\nsweeps out, grows larger, restrains itself, and dares no longer dart\nupwards in spires and lancet windows, as it did later on, in so many\nmarvellous cathedrals. One would say that it were conscious of the\nvicinity of the heavy Romanesque pillars.\n\nHowever, these edifices of the transition from the Romanesque to the\nGothic, are no less precious for study than the pure types. They express\na shade of the art which would be lost without them. It is the graft of\nthe pointed upon the round arch.\n\nNotre-Dame de Paris is, in particular, a curious specimen of this\nvariety. Each face, each stone of the venerable monument, is a page not\nonly of the history of the country, but of the history of science and\nart as well. Thus, in order to indicate here only the principal details,\nwhile the little Red Door almost attains to the limits of the Gothic\ndelicacy of the fifteenth century, the pillars of the nave, by their\nsize and weight, go back to the Carlovingian Abbey of Saint-Germain des\nPr\u00c3\u00a9s. One would suppose that six centuries separated these pillars from\nthat door. There is no one, not even the hermetics, who does not find\nin the symbols of the grand portal a satisfactory compendium of their\nscience, of which the Church of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was so\ncomplete a hieroglyph. Thus, the Roman abbey, the philosophers' church,\nthe Gothic art, Saxon art, the heavy, round pillar, which recalls\nGregory VII., the hermetic symbolism, with which Nicolas Flamel played\nthe prelude to Luther, papal unity, schism, Saint-Germain des Pr\u00c3\u00a9s,\nSaint-Jacques de la Boucherie,--all are mingled, combined, amalgamated\nin Notre-Dame. This central mother church is, among the ancient churches\nof Paris, a sort of chimera; it has the head of one, the limbs of\nanother, the haunches of another, something of all.\n\nWe repeat it, these hybrid constructions are not the least interesting\nfor the artist, for the antiquarian, for the historian. They make\none feel to what a degree architecture is a primitive thing, by\ndemonstrating (what is also demonstrated by the cyclopean vestiges,\nthe pyramids of Egypt, the gigantic Hindoo pagodas) that the greatest\nproducts of architecture are less the works of individuals than of\nsociety; rather the offspring of a nation's effort, than the inspired\nflash of a man of genius; the deposit left by a whole people; the heaps\naccumulated by centuries; the residue of successive evaporations of\nhuman society,--in a word, species of formations. Each wave of time\ncontributes its alluvium, each race deposits its layer on the monument,\neach individual brings his stone. Thus do the beavers, thus do the bees,\nthus do men. The great symbol of architecture, Babel, is a hive.\n\nGreat edifices, like great mountains, are the work of centuries. Art\noften undergoes a transformation while they are pending, _pendent opera\ninterrupta_; they proceed quietly in accordance with the transformed\nart. The new art takes the monument where it finds it, incrusts itself\nthere, assimilates it to itself, develops it according to its fancy,\nand finishes it if it can. The thing is accomplished without trouble,\nwithout effort, without reaction,--following a natural and tranquil\nlaw. It is a graft which shoots up, a sap which circulates, a vegetation\nwhich starts forth anew. Certainly there is matter here for many large\nvolumes, and often the universal history of humanity in the successive\nengrafting of many arts at many levels, upon the same monument. The man,\nthe artist, the individual, is effaced in these great masses, which\nlack the name of their author; human intelligence is there summed up and\ntotalized. Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.\n\nNot to consider here anything except the Christian architecture of\nEurope, that younger sister of the great masonries of the Orient,\nit appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three\nwell-defined zones, which are superposed, the one upon the other: the\nRomanesque zone*, the Gothic zone, the zone of the Renaissance, which\nwe would gladly call the Greco-Roman zone. The Roman layer, which is\nthe most ancient and deepest, is occupied by the round arch, which\nreappears, supported by the Greek column, in the modern and upper layer\nof the Renaissance. The pointed arch is found between the two. The\nedifices which belong exclusively to any one of these three layers\nare perfectly distinct, uniform, and complete. There is the Abbey of\nJumi\u00c3\u00a9ges, there is the Cathedral of Reims, there is the Sainte-Croix of\nOrleans. But the three zones mingle and amalgamate along the edges, like\nthe colors in the solar spectrum. Hence, complex monuments, edifices\nof gradation and transition. One is Roman at the base, Gothic in the\nmiddle, Greco-Roman at the top. It is because it was six hundred years\nin building. This variety is rare. The donjon keep of d'Etampes is a\nspecimen of it. But monuments of two formations are more frequent. There\nis Notre-Dame de Paris, a pointed-arch edifice, which is imbedded by\nits pillars in that Roman zone, in which are plunged the portal of\nSaint-Denis, and the nave of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00c3\u00a9s. There is the\ncharming, half-Gothic chapter-house of Bocherville, where the Roman\nlayer extends half way up. There is the cathedral of Rouen, which would\nbe entirely Gothic if it did not bathe the tip of its central spire in\nthe zone of the Renaissance.**\n\n\n     *  This is the same which is called, according to locality,\nclimate, and races, Lombard, Saxon, or Byzantine. There are four sister\nand parallel architectures, each having its special character, but\nderived from the same origin, the round arch.\n\n  _Facies non omnibus una,\n  No diversa tamen, qualem_, etc.\n\nTheir faces not all alike, nor yet different, but such as the faces of\nsisters ought to be.\n\n     **  This portion of the spire, which was of woodwork, is precisely\nthat which was consumed by lightning, in 1823.\n\n\nHowever, all these shades, all these differences, do not affect the\nsurfaces of edifices only. It is art which has changed its skin. The\nvery constitution of the Christian church is not attacked by it. There\nis always the same internal woodwork, the same logical arrangement\nof parts. Whatever may be the carved and embroidered envelope of a\ncathedral, one always finds beneath it--in the state of a germ, and of\na rudiment at the least--the Roman basilica. It is eternally developed\nupon the soil according to the same law. There are, invariably, two\nnaves, which intersect in a cross, and whose upper portion, rounded into\nan apse, forms the choir; there are always the side aisles, for interior\nprocessions, for chapels,--a sort of lateral walks or promenades where\nthe principal nave discharges itself through the spaces between the\npillars. That settled, the number of chapels, doors, bell towers,\nand pinnacles are modified to infinity, according to the fancy of the\ncentury, the people, and art. The service of religion once assured\nand provided for, architecture does what she pleases. Statues,\nstained glass, rose windows, arabesques, denticulations, capitals,\nbas-reliefs,--she combines all these imaginings according to the\narrangement which best suits her. Hence, the prodigious exterior variety\nof these edifices, at whose foundation dwells so much order and unity.\nThe trunk of a tree is immovable; the foliage is capricious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF PARIS.\n\n\n\nWe have just attempted to restore, for the reader's benefit, that\nadmirable church of Notre-Dame de Paris. We have briefly pointed out\nthe greater part of the beauties which it possessed in the fifteenth\ncentury, and which it lacks to-day; but we have omitted the principal\nthing,--the view of Paris which was then to be obtained from the summits\nof its towers.\n\nThat was, in fact,--when, after having long groped one's way up the dark\nspiral which perpendicularly pierces the thick wall of the belfries,\none emerged, at last abruptly, upon one of the lofty platforms inundated\nwith light and air,--that was, in fact, a fine picture which spread\nout, on all sides at once, before the eye; a spectacle _sui generis_, of\nwhich those of our readers who have had the good fortune to see a\nGothic city entire, complete, homogeneous,--a few of which still remain,\nNuremberg in Bavaria and Vittoria in Spain,--can readily form an idea;\nor even smaller specimens, provided that they are well preserved,--Vitr\u00c3\u00a9\nin Brittany, Nordhausen in Prussia.\n\nThe Paris of three hundred and fifty years ago--the Paris of the\nfifteenth century--was already a gigantic city. We Parisians generally\nmake a mistake as to the ground which we think that we have gained,\nsince Paris has not increased much over one-third since the time of\nLouis XI. It has certainly lost more in beauty than it has gained in\nsize.\n\nParis had its birth, as the reader knows, in that old island of the City\nwhich has the form of a cradle. The strand of that island was its\nfirst boundary wall, the Seine its first moat. Paris remained for many\ncenturies in its island state, with two bridges, one on the north, the\nother on the south; and two bridge heads, which were at the same time\nits gates and its fortresses,--the Grand-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet on the right bank,\nthe Petit-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet on the left. Then, from the date of the kings of the\nfirst race, Paris, being too cribbed and confined in its island, and\nunable to return thither, crossed the water. Then, beyond the Grand,\nbeyond the Petit-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, a first circle of walls and towers began to\ninfringe upon the country on the two sides of the Seine. Some vestiges\nof this ancient enclosure still remained in the last century; to-day,\nonly the memory of it is left, and here and there a tradition, the\nBaudets or Baudoyer gate, \"Porte Bagauda\".\n\nLittle by little, the tide of houses, always thrust from the heart of\nthe city outwards, overflows, devours, wears away, and effaces this\nwall. Philip Augustus makes a new dike for it. He imprisons Paris in a\ncircular chain of great towers, both lofty and solid. For the period of\nmore than a century, the houses press upon each other, accumulate, and\nraise their level in this basin, like water in a reservoir. They begin\nto deepen; they pile story upon story; they mount upon each other; they\ngush forth at the top, like all laterally compressed growth, and there\nis a rivalry as to which shall thrust its head above its neighbors, for\nthe sake of getting a little air. The street glows narrower and deeper,\nevery space is overwhelmed and disappears. The houses finally leap the\nwall of Philip Augustus, and scatter joyfully over the plain, without\norder, and all askew, like runaways. There they plant themselves\nsquarely, cut themselves gardens from the fields, and take their\nease. Beginning with 1367, the city spreads to such an extent into the\nsuburbs, that a new wall becomes necessary, particularly on the right\nbank; Charles V. builds it. But a city like Paris is perpetually\ngrowing. It is only such cities that become capitals. They are funnels,\ninto which all the geographical, political, moral, and intellectual\nwater-sheds of a country, all the natural slopes of a people, pour;\nwells of civilization, so to speak, and also sewers, where commerce,\nindustry, intelligence, population,--all that is sap, all that is life,\nall that is the soul of a nation, filters and amasses unceasingly, drop\nby drop, century by century.\n\n\nSo Charles V.'s wall suffered the fate of that of Philip Augustus. At\nthe end of the fifteenth century, the Faubourg strides across it, passes\nbeyond it, and runs farther. In the sixteenth, it seems to retreat\nvisibly, and to bury itself deeper and deeper in the old city, so thick\nhad the new city already become outside of it. Thus, beginning with the\nfifteenth century, where our story finds us, Paris had already outgrown\nthe three concentric circles of walls which, from the time of Julian the\nApostate, existed, so to speak, in germ in the Grand-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet and the\nPetit-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet. The mighty city had cracked, in succession, its four\nenclosures of walls, like a child grown too large for his garments of\nlast year. Under Louis XI., this sea of houses was seen to be pierced\nat intervals by several groups of ruined towers, from the ancient wall,\nlike the summits of hills in an inundation,--like archipelagos of the\nold Paris submerged beneath the new. Since that time Paris has undergone\nyet another transformation, unfortunately for our eyes; but it has\npassed only one more wall, that of Louis XV., that miserable wall of\nmud and spittle, worthy of the king who built it, worthy of the poet who\nsung it,--\n\n  _Le mur murant Paris rend Paris murmurant_.*\n\n\n     *  The wall walling Paris makes Paris murmur.\n\n\nIn the fifteenth century, Paris was still divided into three wholly\ndistinct and separate towns, each having its own physiognomy, its own\nspecialty, its manners, customs, privileges, and history: the City, the\nUniversity, the Town. The City, which occupied the island, was the\nmost ancient, the smallest, and the mother of the other two, crowded in\nbetween them like (may we be pardoned the comparison) a little old woman\nbetween two large and handsome maidens. The University covered the left\nbank of the Seine, from the Tournelle to the Tour de Nesle, points which\ncorrespond in the Paris of to-day, the one to the wine market, the other\nto the mint. Its wall included a large part of that plain where Julian\nhad built his hot baths. The hill of Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve was enclosed in\nit. The culminating point of this sweep of walls was the Papal gate,\nthat is to say, near the present site of the Pantheon. The Town, which\nwas the largest of the three fragments of Paris, held the right bank.\nIts quay, broken or interrupted in many places, ran along the Seine,\nfrom the Tour de Billy to the Tour du Bois; that is to say, from the\nplace where the granary stands to-day, to the present site of the\nTuileries. These four points, where the Seine intersected the wall of\nthe capital, the Tournelle and the Tour de Nesle on the right, the Tour\nde Billy and the Tour du Bois on the left, were called pre-eminently,\n\"the four towers of Paris.\" The Town encroached still more extensively\nupon the fields than the University. The culminating point of the\nTown wall (that of Charles V.) was at the gates of Saint-Denis and\nSaint-Martin, whose situation has not been changed.\n\nAs we have just said, each of these three great divisions of Paris was a\ntown, but too special a town to be complete, a city which could not\nget along without the other two. Hence three entirely distinct aspects:\nchurches abounded in the City; palaces, in the Town; and colleges,\nin the University. Neglecting here the originalities, of secondary\nimportance in old Paris, and the capricious regulations regarding the\npublic highways, we will say, from a general point of view, taking only\nmasses and the whole group, in this chaos of communal jurisdictions,\nthat the island belonged to the bishop, the right bank to the provost of\nthe merchants, the left bank to the Rector; over all ruled the provost\nof Paris, a royal not a municipal official. The City had Notre-Dame; the\nTown, the Louvre and the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville; the University, the Sorbonne.\nThe Town had the markets (Halles); the city, the Hospital; the\nUniversity, the Pr\u00c3\u00a9-aux-Clercs. Offences committed by the scholars\non the left bank were tried in the law courts on the island, and were\npunished on the right bank at Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on; unless the rector, feeling the\nuniversity to be strong and the king weak, intervened; for it was the\nstudents' privilege to be hanged on their own grounds.\n\nThe greater part of these privileges, it may be noted in passing, and\nthere were some even better than the above, had been extorted from the\nkings by revolts and mutinies. It is the course of things from time\nimmemorial; the king only lets go when the people tear away. There is an\nold charter which puts the matter naively: apropos of fidelity: _Civibus\nfidelitas in reges, qu\u00c3\u00a6 tamen aliquoties seditionibus interrypta, multa\npeperit privileyia_.\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the Seine bathed five islands within the walls\nof Paris: Louviers island, where there were then trees, and where there\nis no longer anything but wood; l'ile aux Vaches, and l'ile Notre-Dame,\nboth deserted, with the exception of one house, both fiefs of the\nbishop--in the seventeenth century, a single island was formed out of\nthese two, which was built upon and named l'ile Saint-Louis--, lastly\nthe City, and at its point, the little islet of the cow tender, which\nwas afterwards engulfed beneath the platform of the Pont-Neuf. The City\nthen had five bridges: three on the right, the Pont Notre-Dame, and the\nPont au Change, of stone, the Pont aux Meuniers, of wood; two on the\nleft, the Petit Pont, of stone, the Pont Saint-Michel, of wood; all\nloaded with houses.\n\nThe University had six gates, built by Philip Augustus; there were,\nbeginning with la Tournelle, the Porte Saint-Victor, the Porte Bordelle,\nthe Porte Papale, the Porte Saint-Jacques, the Porte Saint-Michel,\nthe Porte Saint-Germain. The Town had six gates, built by Charles V.;\nbeginning with the Tour de Billy they were: the Porte Saint-Antoine,\nthe Porte du Temple, the Porte Saint-Martin, the Porte Saint-Denis, the\nPorte Montmartre, the Porte Saint-Honor\u00c3\u00a9. All these gates were strong,\nand also handsome, which does not detract from strength. A large, deep\nmoat, with a brisk current during the high water of winter, bathed the\nbase of the wall round Paris; the Seine furnished the water. At night,\nthe gates were shut, the river was barred at both ends of the city with\nhuge iron chains, and Paris slept tranquilly.\n\nFrom a bird's-eye view, these three burgs, the City, the Town, and\nthe University, each presented to the eye an inextricable skein of\neccentrically tangled streets. Nevertheless, at first sight, one\nrecognized the fact that these three fragments formed but one body.\nOne immediately perceived three long parallel streets, unbroken,\nundisturbed, traversing, almost in a straight line, all three cities,\nfrom one end to the other; from North to South, perpendicularly, to the\nSeine, which bound them together, mingled them, infused them in each\nother, poured and transfused the people incessantly, from one to the\nother, and made one out of the three. The first of these streets ran\nfrom the Porte Saint-Martin: it was called the Rue Saint-Jacques in\nthe University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint-Martin in the\nTown; it crossed the water twice, under the name of the Petit Pont and\nthe Pont Notre-Dame. The second, which was called the Rue de la Harpe\non the left bank, Rue de la Barilleri\u00c3\u00a9 in the island, Rue Saint-Denis\non the right bank, Pont Saint-Michel on one arm of the Seine, Pont au\nChange on the other, ran from the Porte Saint-Michel in the University,\nto the Porte Saint-Denis in the Town. However, under all these names,\nthere were but two streets, parent streets, generating streets,--the two\narteries of Paris. All the other veins of the triple city either derived\ntheir supply from them or emptied into them.\n\nIndependently of these two principal streets, piercing Paris\ndiametrically in its whole breadth, from side to side, common to the\nentire capital, the City and the University had also each its own great\nspecial street, which ran lengthwise by them, parallel to the Seine,\ncutting, as it passed, at right angles, the two arterial thoroughfares.\nThus, in the Town, one descended in a straight line from the Porte\nSaint-Antoine to the Porte Saint-Honor\u00c3\u00a9; in the University from\nthe Porte Saint-Victor to the Porte Saint-Germain. These two great\nthoroughfares intersected by the two first, formed the canvas upon which\nreposed, knotted and crowded together on every hand, the labyrinthine\nnetwork of the streets of Paris. In the incomprehensible plan of\nthese streets, one distinguished likewise, on looking attentively, two\nclusters of great streets, like magnified sheaves of grain, one in the\nUniversity, the other in the Town, which spread out gradually from the\nbridges to the gates.\n\nSome traces of this geometrical plan still exist to-day.\n\nNow, what aspect did this whole present, when, as viewed from the summit\nof the towers of Notre-Dame, in 1482? That we shall try to describe.\n\nFor the spectator who arrived, panting, upon that pinnacle, it was first\na dazzling confusing view of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, places,\nspires, bell towers. Everything struck your eye at once: the carved\ngable, the pointed roof, the turrets suspended at the angles of the\nwalls; the stone pyramids of the eleventh century, the slate obelisks of\nthe fifteenth; the round, bare tower of the donjon keep; the square and\nfretted tower of the church; the great and the little, the massive and\nthe aerial. The eye was, for a long time, wholly lost in this labyrinth,\nwhere there was nothing which did not possess its originality, its\nreason, its genius, its beauty,--nothing which did not proceed from art;\nbeginning with the smallest house, with its painted and carved front,\nwith external beams, elliptical door, with projecting stories, to the\nroyal Louvre, which then had a colonnade of towers. But these are the\nprincipal masses which were then to be distinguished when the eye began\nto accustom itself to this tumult of edifices.\n\nIn the first place, the City.--\"The island of the City,\" as Sauval says,\nwho, in spite of his confused medley, sometimes has such happy turns of\nexpression,--\"the island of the city is made like a great ship, stuck in\nthe mud and run aground in the current, near the centre of the Seine.\"\n\nWe have just explained that, in the fifteenth century, this ship was\nanchored to the two banks of the river by five bridges. This form of a\nship had also struck the heraldic scribes; for it is from that, and\nnot from the siege by the Normans, that the ship which blazons the old\nshield of Paris, comes, according to Favyn and Pasquier. For him\nwho understands how to decipher them, armorial bearings are algebra,\narmorial bearings have a tongue. The whole history of the second half of\nthe Middle Ages is written in armorial bearings,--the first half is\nin the symbolism of the Roman churches. They are the hieroglyphics of\nfeudalism, succeeding those of theocracy.\n\nThus the City first presented itself to the eye, with its stern to the\neast, and its prow to the west. Turning towards the prow, one had before\none an innumerable flock of ancient roofs, over which arched broadly the\nlead-covered apse of the Sainte-Chapelle, like an elephant's haunches\nloaded with its tower. Only here, this tower was the most audacious, the\nmost open, the most ornamented spire of cabinet-maker's work that ever\nlet the sky peep through its cone of lace. In front of Notre-Dame, and\nvery near at hand, three streets opened into the cathedral square,--a\nfine square, lined with ancient houses. Over the south side of this\nplace bent the wrinkled and sullen fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Dieu, and its\nroof, which seemed covered with warts and pustules. Then, on the right\nand the left, to east and west, within that wall of the City, which was\nyet so contracted, rose the bell towers of its one and twenty churches,\nof every date, of every form, of every size, from the low and wormeaten\nbelfry of Saint-Denis du Pas (_Carcer Glaueini_) to the slender needles\nof Saint-Pierre aux Boeufs and Saint-Landry.\n\nBehind Notre-Dame, the cloister and its Gothic galleries spread out\ntowards the north; on the south, the half-Roman palace of the bishop; on\nthe east, the desert point of the Terrain. In this throng of houses the\neye also distinguished, by the lofty open-work mitres of stone which\nthen crowned the roof itself, even the most elevated windows of the\npalace, the H\u00c3\u00b4tel given by the city, under Charles VI., to Juv\u00c3\u00a9nal\ndes Ursins; a little farther on, the pitch-covered sheds of the Palus\nMarket; in still another quarter the new apse of Saint-Germain le Vieux,\nlengthened in 1458, with a bit of the Rue aux Febves; and then, in\nplaces, a square crowded with people; a pillory, erected at the corner\nof a street; a fine fragment of the pavement of Philip Augustus, a\nmagnificent flagging, grooved for the horses' feet, in the middle of the\nroad, and so badly replaced in the sixteenth century by the miserable\ncobblestones, called the \"pavement of the League;\" a deserted back\ncourtyard, with one of those diaphanous staircase turrets, such as were\nerected in the fifteenth century, one of which is still to be seen in\nthe Rue des Bourdonnais. Lastly, at the right of the Sainte-Chapelle,\ntowards the west, the Palais de Justice rested its group of towers at\nthe edge of the water. The thickets of the king's gardens, which covered\nthe western point of the City, masked the Island du Passeur. As for the\nwater, from the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame one hardly saw it, on\neither side of the City; the Seine was hidden by bridges, the bridges by\nhouses.\n\nAnd when the glance passed these bridges, whose roofs were visibly\ngreen, rendered mouldy before their time by the vapors from the water,\nif it was directed to the left, towards the University, the first\nedifice which struck it was a large, low sheaf of towers, the\nPetit-Ch\u00c3\u00a0telet, whose yawning gate devoured the end of the Petit-Pont.\nThen, if your view ran along the bank, from east to west, from the\nTournelle to the Tour de Nesle, there was a long cordon of houses, with\ncarved beams, stained-glass windows, each story projecting over that\nbeneath it, an interminable zigzag of bourgeois gables, frequently\ninterrupted by the mouth of a street, and from time to time also by the\nfront or angle of a huge stone mansion, planted at its ease, with courts\nand gardens, wings and detached buildings, amid this populace of crowded\nand narrow houses, like a grand gentleman among a throng of rustics.\nThere were five or six of these mansions on the quay, from the house of\nLorraine, which shared with the Bernardins the grand enclosure adjoining\nthe Tournelle, to the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Nesle, whose principal tower ended Paris,\nand whose pointed roofs were in a position, during three months of the\nyear, to encroach, with their black triangles, upon the scarlet disk of\nthe setting sun.\n\nThis side of the Seine was, however, the least mercantile of the two.\nStudents furnished more of a crowd and more noise there than artisans,\nand there was not, properly speaking, any quay, except from the Pont\nSaint-Michel to the Tour de Nesle. The rest of the bank of the Seine was\nnow a naked strand, the same as beyond the Bernardins; again, a throng\nof houses, standing with their feet in the water, as between the two\nbridges.\n\nThere was a great uproar of laundresses; they screamed, and talked, and\nsang from morning till night along the beach, and beat a great deal of\nlinen there, just as in our day. This is not the least of the gayeties\nof Paris.\n\nThe University presented a dense mass to the eye. From one end to\nthe other, it was homogeneous and compact. The thousand roofs, dense,\nangular, clinging to each other, composed, nearly all, of the same\ngeometrical element, offered, when viewed from above, the aspect of a\ncrystallization of the same substance.\n\nThe capricious ravine of streets did not cut this block of houses into\ntoo disproportionate slices. The forty-two colleges were scattered about\nin a fairly equal manner, and there were some everywhere. The amusingly\nvaried crests of these beautiful edifices were the product of the same\nart as the simple roofs which they overshot, and were, actually, only a\nmultiplication of the square or the cube of the same geometrical\nfigure. Hence they complicated the whole effect, without disturbing\nit; completed, without overloading it. Geometry is harmony. Some\nfine mansions here and there made magnificent outlines against the\npicturesque attics of the left bank. The house of Nevers, the house of\nRome, the house of Reims, which have disappeared; the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Cluny,\nwhich still exists, for the consolation of the artist, and whose tower\nwas so stupidly deprived of its crown a few years ago. Close to Cluny,\nthat Roman palace, with fine round arches, were once the hot baths of\nJulian. There were a great many abbeys, of a beauty more devout, of a\ngrandeur more solemn than the mansions, but not less beautiful, not less\ngrand. Those which first caught the eye were the Bernardins, with their\nthree bell towers; Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve, whose square tower, which still\nexists, makes us regret the rest; the Sorbonne, half college, half\nmonastery, of which so admirable a nave survives; the fine quadrilateral\ncloister of the Mathurins; its neighbor, the cloister of Saint-Benoit,\nwithin whose walls they have had time to cobble up a theatre, between\nthe seventh and eighth editions of this book; the Cordeliers, with their\nthree enormous adjacent gables; the Augustins, whose graceful spire\nformed, after the Tour de Nesle, the second denticulation on this side\nof Paris, starting from the west. The colleges, which are, in fact, the\nintermediate ring between the cloister and the world, hold the middle\nposition in the monumental series between the H\u00c3\u00b4tels and the abbeys,\nwith a severity full of elegance, sculpture less giddy than the palaces,\nan architecture less severe than the convents. Unfortunately, hardly\nanything remains of these monuments, where Gothic art combined with\nso just a balance, richness and economy. The churches (and they were\nnumerous and splendid in the University, and they were graded there also\nin all the ages of architecture, from the round arches of Saint-Julian\nto the pointed arches of Saint-S\u00c3\u00a9verin), the churches dominated the\nwhole; and, like one harmony more in this mass of harmonies, they\npierced in quick succession the multiple open work of the gables with\nslashed spires, with open-work bell towers, with slender pinnacles,\nwhose line was also only a magnificent exaggeration of the acute angle\nof the roofs.\n\nThe ground of the University was hilly; Mount Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve formed an\nenormous mound to the south; and it was a sight to see from the summit\nof Notre-Dame how that throng of narrow and tortuous streets (to-day\nthe Latin Quarter), those bunches of houses which, spread out in every\ndirection from the top of this eminence, precipitated themselves in\ndisorder, and almost perpendicularly down its flanks, nearly to the\nwater's edge, having the air, some of falling, others of clambering up\nagain, and all of holding to one another. A continual flux of a thousand\nblack points which passed each other on the pavements made everything\nmove before the eyes; it was the populace seen thus from aloft and afar.\n\nLastly, in the intervals of these roofs, of these spires, of these\naccidents of numberless edifices, which bent and writhed, and jagged in\nso eccentric a manner the extreme line of the University, one caught a\nglimpse, here and there, of a great expanse of moss-grown wall, a thick,\nround tower, a crenellated city gate, shadowing forth the fortress;\nit was the wall of Philip Augustus. Beyond, the fields gleamed green;\nbeyond, fled the roads, along which were scattered a few more suburban\nhouses, which became more infrequent as they became more distant. Some\nof these faubourgs were important: there were, first, starting from la\nTournelle, the Bourg Saint-Victor, with its one arch bridge over the\nBi\u00c3\u00a8vre, its abbey where one could read the epitaph of Louis le Gros,\n_epitaphium Ludovici Grossi_, and its church with an octagonal spire,\nflanked with four little bell towers of the eleventh century (a similar\none can be seen at Etampes; it is not yet destroyed); next, the Bourg\nSaint-Marceau, which already had three churches and one convent; then,\nleaving the mill of the Gobelins and its four white walls on the left,\nthere was the Faubourg Saint-Jacques with the beautiful carved cross\nin its square; the church of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas, which was then\nGothic, pointed, charming; Saint-Magloire, a fine nave of the fourteenth\ncentury, which Napoleon turned into a hayloft; Notre-Dame des Champs,\nwhere there were Byzantine mosaics; lastly, after having left behind,\nfull in the country, the Monastery des Chartreux, a rich edifice\ncontemporary with the Palais de Justice, with its little garden divided\ninto compartments, and the haunted ruins of Vauvert, the eye fell, to\nthe west, upon the three Roman spires of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00c3\u00a9s. The\nBourg Saint-Germain, already a large community, formed fifteen or twenty\nstreets in the rear; the pointed bell tower of Saint-Sulpice marked\none corner of the town. Close beside it one descried the quadrilateral\nenclosure of the fair of Saint-Germain, where the market is situated\nto-day; then the abbot's pillory, a pretty little round tower, well\ncapped with a leaden cone; the brickyard was further on, and the Rue du\nFour, which led to the common bakehouse, and the mill on its hillock,\nand the lazar house, a tiny house, isolated and half seen.\n\nBut that which attracted the eye most of all, and fixed it for a long\ntime on that point, was the abbey itself. It is certain that this\nmonastery, which had a grand air, both as a church and as a seignory;\nthat abbatial palace, where the bishops of Paris counted themselves\nhappy if they could pass the night; that refectory, upon which the\narchitect had bestowed the air, the beauty, and the rose window of a\ncathedral; that elegant chapel of the Virgin; that monumental dormitory;\nthose vast gardens; that portcullis; that drawbridge; that envelope\nof battlements which notched to the eye the verdure of the surrounding\nmeadows; those courtyards, where gleamed men at arms, intermingled with\ngolden copes;--the whole grouped and clustered about three lofty spires,\nwith round arches, well planted upon a Gothic apse, made a magnificent\nfigure against the horizon.\n\nWhen, at length, after having contemplated the University for a long\ntime, you turned towards the right bank, towards the Town, the character\nof the spectacle was abruptly altered. The Town, in fact much larger\nthan the University, was also less of a unit. At the first glance, one\nsaw that it was divided into many masses, singularly distinct. First, to\nthe eastward, in that part of the town which still takes its name from\nthe marsh where Camulog\u00c3\u00a8nes entangled Caesar, was a pile of palaces. The\nblock extended to the very water's edge. Four almost contiguous H\u00c3\u00b4tels,\nJouy, Sens, Barbeau, the house of the Queen, mirrored their slate peaks,\nbroken with slender turrets, in the Seine.\n\nThese four edifices filled the space from the Rue des Nonaindi\u00c3\u00a8res, to\nthe abbey of the Celestins, whose spire gracefully relieved their line\nof gables and battlements. A few miserable, greenish hovels, hanging\nover the water in front of these sumptuous H\u00c3\u00b4tels, did not prevent\none from seeing the fine angles of their fa\u00c3\u00a7ades, their large, square\nwindows with stone mullions, their pointed porches overloaded with\nstatues, the vivid outlines of their walls, always clear cut, and all\nthose charming accidents of architecture, which cause Gothic art to have\nthe air of beginning its combinations afresh with every monument.\n\nBehind these palaces, extended in all directions, now broken, fenced in,\nbattlemented like a citadel, now veiled by great trees like a Carthusian\nconvent, the immense and multiform enclosure of that miraculous H\u00c3\u00b4tel\nde Saint-Pol, where the King of France possessed the means of lodging\nsuperbly two and twenty princes of the rank of the dauphin and the Duke\nof Burgundy, with their domestics and their suites, without counting the\ngreat lords, and the emperor when he came to view Paris, and the lions,\nwho had their separate H\u00c3\u00b4tel at the royal H\u00c3\u00b4tel. Let us say here that\na prince's apartment was then composed of never less than eleven large\nrooms, from the chamber of state to the oratory, not to mention the\ngalleries, baths, vapor-baths, and other \"superfluous places,\" with\nwhich each apartment was provided; not to mention the private gardens\nfor each of the king's guests; not to mention the kitchens, the\ncellars, the domestic offices, the general refectories of the house, the\npoultry-yards, where there were twenty-two general laboratories, from\nthe bakehouses to the wine-cellars; games of a thousand sorts, malls,\ntennis, and riding at the ring; aviaries, fishponds, menageries,\nstables, barns, libraries, arsenals and foundries. This was what a\nking's palace, a Louvre, a H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Saint-Pol was then. A city within a\ncity.\n\nFrom the tower where we are placed, the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Saint-Pol, almost half\nhidden by the four great houses of which we have just spoken, was\nstill very considerable and very marvellous to see. One could there\ndistinguish, very well, though cleverly united with the principal\nbuilding by long galleries, decked with painted glass and slender\ncolumns, the three H\u00c3\u00b4tels which Charles V. had amalgamated with his\npalace: the H\u00c3\u00b4tel du Petit-Muce, with the airy balustrade, which formed\na graceful border to its roof; the H\u00c3\u00b4tel of the Abbe de Saint-Maur,\nhaving the vanity of a stronghold, a great tower, machicolations,\nloopholes, iron gratings, and over the large Saxon door, the armorial\nbearings of the abb\u00c3\u00a9, between the two mortises of the drawbridge; the\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel of the Comte d' Etampes, whose donjon keep, ruined at its summit,\nwas rounded and notched like a cock's comb; here and there, three or\nfour ancient oaks, forming a tuft together like enormous cauliflowers;\ngambols of swans, in the clear water of the fishponds, all in folds of\nlight and shade; many courtyards of which one beheld picturesque bits;\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel of the Lions, with its low, pointed arches on short, Saxon\npillars, its iron gratings and its perpetual roar; shooting up above\nthe whole, the scale-ornamented spire of the Ave-Maria; on the left, the\nhouse of the Provost of Paris, flanked by four small towers, delicately\ngrooved, in the middle; at the extremity, the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Saint-Pol, properly\nspeaking, with its multiplied fa\u00c3\u00a7ades, its successive enrichments from\nthe time of Charles V., the hybrid excrescences, with which the fancy of\nthe architects had loaded it during the last two centuries, with all\nthe apses of its chapels, all the gables of its galleries, a thousand\nweathercocks for the four winds, and its two lofty contiguous towers,\nwhose conical roof, surrounded by battlements at its base, looked like\nthose pointed caps which have their edges turned up.\n\nContinuing to mount the stories of this amphitheatre of palaces spread\nout afar upon the ground, after crossing a deep ravine hollowed out\nof the roofs in the Town, which marked the passage of the Rue\nSaint-Antoine, the eye reached the house of Angoul\u00c3\u00aame, a vast\nconstruction of many epochs, where there were perfectly new and very\nwhite parts, which melted no better into the whole than a red patch on a\nblue doublet. Nevertheless, the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the\nmodern palace, bristling with carved eaves, covered with sheets of lead,\nwhere coiled a thousand fantastic arabesques of sparkling incrustations\nof gilded bronze, that roof, so curiously damascened, darted upwards\ngracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice;\nwhose huge and ancient towers, rounded by age like casks, sinking\ntogether with old age, and rending themselves from top to bottom,\nresembled great bellies unbuttoned. Behind rose the forest of spires of\nthe Palais des Tournelles. Not a view in the world, either at Chambord\nor at the Alhambra, is more magic, more aerial, more enchanting, than\nthat thicket of spires, tiny bell towers, chimneys, weather-vanes,\nwinding staircases, lanterns through which the daylight makes its way,\nwhich seem cut out at a blow, pavilions, spindle-shaped turrets, or, as\nthey were then called, \"tournelles,\" all differing in form, in height,\nand attitude. One would have pronounced it a gigantic stone chess-board.\n\nTo the right of the Tournelles, that truss of enormous towers, black as\nink, running into each other and tied, as it were, by a circular moat;\nthat donjon keep, much more pierced with loopholes than with windows;\nthat drawbridge, always raised; that portcullis, always lowered,--is\nthe Bastille. Those sorts of black beaks which project from between the\nbattlements, and which you take from a distance to be cave spouts, are\ncannons.\n\nBeneath them, at the foot of the formidable edifice, behold the Porte\nSainte-Antoine, buried between its two towers.\n\nBeyond the Tournelles, as far as the wall of Charles V., spread out,\nwith rich compartments of verdure and of flowers, a velvet carpet of\ncultivated land and royal parks, in the midst of which one recognized,\nby its labyrinth of trees and alleys, the famous Daedalus garden which\nLouis XI. had given to Coictier. The doctor's observatory rose above the\nlabyrinth like a great isolated column, with a tiny house for a capital.\nTerrible astrologies took place in that laboratory.\n\nThere to-day is the Place Royale.\n\nAs we have just said, the quarter of the palace, of which we have just\nendeavored to give the reader some idea by indicating only the chief\npoints, filled the angle which Charles V.'s wall made with the Seine on\nthe east. The centre of the Town was occupied by a pile of houses for\nthe populace. It was there, in fact, that the three bridges disgorged\nupon the right bank, and bridges lead to the building of houses rather\nthan palaces. That congregation of bourgeois habitations, pressed\ntogether like the cells in a hive, had a beauty of its own. It is with\nthe roofs of a capital as with the waves of the sea,--they are grand.\nFirst the streets, crossed and entangled, forming a hundred amusing\nfigures in the block; around the market-place, it was like a star with a\nthousand rays.\n\nThe Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, with their innumerable\nramifications, rose one after the other, like trees intertwining their\nbranches; and then the tortuous lines, the Rues de la Pl\u00c3\u00a2trerie, de la\nVerrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., meandered over all. There were also\nfine edifices which pierced the petrified undulations of that sea of\ngables. At the head of the Pont aux Changeurs, behind which one beheld\nthe Seine foaming beneath the wheels of the Pont aux Meuniers, there was\nthe Chalelet, no longer a Roman tower, as under Julian the Apostate, but\na feudal tower of the thirteenth century, and of a stone so hard that\nthe pickaxe could not break away so much as the thickness of the fist\nin a space of three hours; there was the rich square bell tower of\nSaint-Jacques de la Boucherie, with its angles all frothing with\ncarvings, already admirable, although it was not finished in the\nfifteenth century. (It lacked, in particular, the four monsters, which,\nstill perched to-day on the corners of its roof, have the air of so\nmany sphinxes who are propounding to new Paris the riddle of the ancient\nParis. Rault, the sculptor, only placed them in position in 1526, and\nreceived twenty francs for his pains.) There was the Maison-aux-Piliers,\nthe Pillar House, opening upon that Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve of which we have\ngiven the reader some idea; there was Saint-Gervais, which a front \"in\ngood taste\" has since spoiled; Saint-M\u00c3\u00a9ry, whose ancient pointed arches\nwere still almost round arches; Saint-Jean, whose magnificent spire was\nproverbial; there were twenty other monuments, which did not disdain to\nbury their wonders in that chaos of black, deep, narrow streets. Add\nthe crosses of carved stone, more lavishly scattered through the\nsquares than even the gibbets; the cemetery of the Innocents, whose\narchitectural wall could be seen in the distance above the roofs; the\npillory of the Markets, whose top was visible between two chimneys of\nthe Rue de la Cossonnerie; the ladder of the Croix-du-Trahoir, in its\nsquare always black with people; the circular buildings of the wheat\nmart; the fragments of Philip Augustus's ancient wall, which could be\nmade out here and there, drowned among the houses, its towers gnawed by\nivy, its gates in ruins, with crumbling and deformed stretches of wall;\nthe quay with its thousand shops, and its bloody knacker's yards; the\nSeine encumbered with boats, from the Port au Foin to Port-l'Ev\u00c3\u00aaque, and\nyou will have a confused picture of what the central trapezium of the\nTown was like in 1482.\n\nWith these two quarters, one of H\u00c3\u00b4tels, the other of houses, the third\nfeature of aspect presented by the city was a long zone of abbeys, which\nbordered it in nearly the whole of its circumference, from the rising to\nthe setting sun, and, behind the circle of fortifications which hemmed\nin Paris, formed a second interior enclosure of convents and chapels.\nThus, immediately adjoining the park des Tournelles, between the\nRue Saint-Antoine and the Vielle Rue du Temple, there stood\nSainte-Catherine, with its immense cultivated lands, which were\nterminated only by the wall of Paris. Between the old and the new Rue du\nTemple, there was the Temple, a sinister group of towers, lofty, erect,\nand isolated in the middle of a vast, battlemented enclosure. Between\nthe Rue Neuve-du-Temple and the Rue Saint-Martin, there was the Abbey\nof Saint-Martin, in the midst of its gardens, a superb fortified church,\nwhose girdle of towers, whose diadem of bell towers, yielded in\nforce and splendor only to Saint-Germain des Pr\u00c3\u00a9s. Between the Rue\nSaint-Martin and the Rue Saint-Denis, spread the enclosure of the\nTrinit\u00c3\u00a9.\n\nLastly, between the Rue Saint-Denis, and the Rue Montorgueil, stood the\nFilles-Dieu. On one side, the rotting roofs and unpaved enclosure of the\nCour des Miracles could be descried. It was the sole profane ring which\nwas linked to that devout chain of convents.\n\nFinally, the fourth compartment, which stretched itself out in the\nagglomeration of the roofs on the right bank, and which occupied the\nwestern angle of the enclosure, and the banks of the river down stream,\nwas a fresh cluster of palaces and H\u00c3\u00b4tels pressed close about the base\nof the Louvre. The old Louvre of Philip Augustus, that immense edifice\nwhose great tower rallied about it three and twenty chief towers, not to\nreckon the lesser towers, seemed from a distance to be enshrined in the\nGothic roofs of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel d'Alen\u00c3\u00a7on, and the Petit-Bourbon. This hydra\nof towers, giant guardian of Paris, with its four and twenty heads,\nalways erect, with its monstrous haunches, loaded or scaled with slates,\nand all streaming with metallic reflections, terminated with wonderful\neffect the configuration of the Town towards the west.\n\nThus an immense block, which the Romans called _iusula_, or island, of\nbourgeois houses, flanked on the right and the left by two blocks of\npalaces, crowned, the one by the Louvre, the other by the Tournelles,\nbordered on the north by a long girdle of abbeys and cultivated\nenclosures, all amalgamated and melted together in one view; upon these\nthousands of edifices, whose tiled and slated roofs outlined upon each\nother so many fantastic chains, the bell towers, tattooed, fluted, and\nornamented with twisted bands, of the four and forty churches on the\nright bank; myriads of cross streets; for boundary on one side, an\nenclosure of lofty walls with square towers (that of the University had\nround towers); on the other, the Seine, cut by bridges, and bearing\non its bosom a multitude of boats; behold the Town of Paris in the\nfifteenth century.\n\nBeyond the walls, several suburban villages pressed close about\nthe gates, but less numerous and more scattered than those of the\nUniversity. Behind the Bastille there were twenty hovels clustered round\nthe curious sculptures of the Croix-Faubin and the flying buttresses of\nthe Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs; then Popincourt, lost amid wheat\nfields; then la Courtille, a merry village of wine-shops; the hamlet of\nSaint-Laurent with its church whose bell tower, from afar, seemed to\nadd itself to the pointed towers of the Porte Saint-Martin; the\nFaubourg Saint-Denis, with the vast enclosure of Saint-Ladre; beyond\nthe Montmartre Gate, the Grange-Bateli\u00c3\u00a8re, encircled with white walls;\nbehind it, with its chalky slopes, Montmartre, which had then almost as\nmany churches as windmills, and which has kept only the windmills,\nfor society no longer demands anything but bread for the body. Lastly,\nbeyond the Louvre, the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00c3\u00a9, already considerable\nat that time, could be seen stretching away into the fields, and\nPetit-Bretagne gleaming green, and the March\u00c3\u00a9 aux Pourceaux spreading\nabroad, in whose centre swelled the horrible apparatus used for boiling\ncounterfeiters. Between la Courtille and Saint-Laurent, your eye had\nalready noticed, on the summit of an eminence crouching amid desert\nplains, a sort of edifice which resembled from a distance a ruined\ncolonnade, mounted upon a basement with its foundation laid bare. This\nwas neither a Parthenon, nor a temple of the Olympian Jupiter. It was\nMontfau\u00c3\u00a7on.\n\nNow, if the enumeration of so many edifices, summary as we have\nendeavored to make it, has not shattered in the reader's mind the\ngeneral image of old Paris, as we have constructed it, we will\nrecapitulate it in a few words. In the centre, the island of the City,\nresembling as to form an enormous tortoise, and throwing out its bridges\nwith tiles for scales; like legs from beneath its gray shell of roofs.\nOn the left, the monolithic trapezium, firm, dense, bristling, of the\nUniversity; on the right, the vast semicircle of the Town, much\nmore intermixed with gardens and monuments. The three blocks, city,\nuniversity, and town, marbled with innumerable streets. Across all,\nthe Seine, \"foster-mother Seine,\" as says Father Du Breul, blocked with\nislands, bridges, and boats. All about an immense plain, patched with\na thousand sorts of cultivated plots, sown with fine villages. On the\nleft, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirarde, Montrouge, Gentilly, with its round\ntower and its square tower, etc.; on the right, twenty others, from\nConflans to Ville-l'Ev\u00c3\u00aaque. On the horizon, a border of hills arranged\nin a circle like the rim of the basin. Finally, far away to the east,\nVincennes, and its seven quadrangular towers to the south, Bic\u00c3\u00aatre and\nits pointed turrets; to the north, Saint-Denis and its spire; to the\nwest, Saint Cloud and its donjon keep. Such was the Paris which the\nravens, who lived in 1482, beheld from the summits of the towers of\nNotre-Dame.\n\nNevertheless, Voltaire said of this city, that \"before Louis XIV.,\nit possessed but four fine monuments\": the dome of the Sorbonne, the\nVal-de-Gr\u00c3\u00a2ce, the modern Louvre, and I know not what the fourth was--the\nLuxembourg, perhaps. Fortunately, Voltaire was the author of \"Candide\"\nin spite of this, and in spite of this, he is, among all the men who\nhave followed each other in the long series of humanity, the one who has\nbest possessed the diabolical laugh. Moreover, this proves that one can\nbe a fine genius, and yet understand nothing of an art to which one\ndoes not belong. Did not Moliere imagine that he was doing Raphael and\nMichael-Angelo a very great honor, by calling them \"those Mignards of\ntheir age?\"\n\nLet us return to Paris and to the fifteenth century.\n\nIt was not then merely a handsome city; it was a homogeneous city, an\narchitectural and historical product of the Middle Ages, a chronicle in\nstone. It was a city formed of two layers only; the Romanesque layer and\nthe Gothic layer; for the Roman layer had disappeared long before, with\nthe exception of the Hot Baths of Julian, where it still pierced\nthrough the thick crust of the Middle Ages. As for the Celtic layer, no\nspecimens were any longer to be found, even when sinking wells.\n\nFifty years later, when the Renaissance began to mingle with this\nunity which was so severe and yet so varied, the dazzling luxury of\nits fantasies and systems, its debasements of Roman round arches, Greek\ncolumns, and Gothic bases, its sculpture which was so tender and so\nideal, its peculiar taste for arabesques and acanthus leaves, its\narchitectural paganism, contemporary with Luther, Paris, was perhaps,\nstill more beautiful, although less harmonious to the eye, and to the\nthought.\n\nBut this splendid moment lasted only for a short time; the Renaissance\nwas not impartial; it did not content itself with building, it wished\nto destroy; it is true that it required the room. Thus Gothic Paris was\ncomplete only for a moment. Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie had barely\nbeen completed when the demolition of the old Louvre was begun.\n\nAfter that, the great city became more disfigured every day. Gothic\nParis, beneath which Roman Paris was effaced, was effaced in its turn;\nbut can any one say what Paris has replaced it?\n\nThere is the Paris of Catherine de Medicis at the Tuileries;*--the\nParis of Henri II., at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Ville, two edifices still in fine\ntaste;--the Paris of Henri IV., at the Place Royale: fa\u00c3\u00a7ades of brick\nwith stone corners, and slated roofs, tri-colored houses;--the Paris of\nLouis XIII., at the Val-de-Grace: a crushed and squat architecture, with\nvaults like basket-handles, and something indescribably pot-bellied in\nthe column, and thickset in the dome;--the Paris of Louis XIV., in\nthe Invalides: grand, rich, gilded, cold;--the Paris of Louis XV., in\nSaint-Sulpice: volutes, knots of ribbon, clouds, vermicelli and chiccory\nleaves, all in stone;--the Paris of Louis XVI., in the Pantheon: Saint\nPeter of Rome, badly copied (the edifice is awkwardly heaped together,\nwhich has not amended its lines);--the Paris of the Republic, in the\nSchool of Medicine: a poor Greek and Roman taste, which resembles\nthe Coliseum or the Parthenon as the constitution of the year III.,\nresembles the laws of Minos,--it is called in architecture, \"the\nMessidor\"** taste;--the Paris of Napoleon in the Place Vendome: this\none is sublime, a column of bronze made of cannons;--the Paris of the\nRestoration, at the Bourse: a very white colonnade supporting a very\nsmooth frieze; the whole is square and cost twenty millions.\n\n\n     *  We have seen with sorrow mingled with indignation, that it\nis the intention to increase, to recast, to make over, that is to say,\nto destroy this admirable palace. The architects of our day have too\nheavy a hand to touch these delicate works of the Renaissance. We still\ncherish a hope that they will not dare. Moreover, this demolition of the\nTuileries now, would be not only a brutal deed of violence, which\nwould make a drunken vandal blush--it would be an act of treason.\nThe Tuileries is not simply a masterpiece of the art of the sixteenth\ncentury, it is a page of the history of the nineteenth. This palace no\nlonger belongs to the king, but to the people. Let us leave it as it is.\nOur revolution has twice set its seal upon its front. On one of its two\nfa\u00c3\u00a7ades, there are the cannon-balls of the 10th of August; on the other,\nthe balls of the 29th of July. It is sacred. Paris, April 1, 1831. (Note\nto the fifth edition.)\n\n     **  The tenth month of the French republican calendar, from the\n19th of June to the 18th of July.\n\n\nTo each of these characteristic monuments there is attached by a\nsimilarity of taste, fashion, and attitude, a certain number of\nhouses scattered about in different quarters and which the eyes of the\nconnoisseur easily distinguishes and furnishes with a date. When\none knows how to look, one finds the spirit of a century, and the\nphysiognomy of a king, even in the knocker on a door.\n\nThe Paris of the present day has then, no general physiognomy. It is\na collection of specimens of many centuries, and the finest have\ndisappeared. The capital grows only in houses, and what houses! At the\nrate at which Paris is now proceeding, it will renew itself every fifty\nyears.\n\nThus the historical significance of its architecture is being effaced\nevery day. Monuments are becoming rarer and rarer, and one seems to see\nthem gradually engulfed, by the flood of houses. Our fathers had a Paris\nof stone; our sons will have one of plaster.\n\nSo far as the modern monuments of new Paris are concerned, we would\ngladly be excused from mentioning them. It is not that we do not admire\nthem as they deserve. The Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve of M. Soufflot is certainly\nthe finest Savoy cake that has ever been made in stone. The Palace of\nthe Legion of Honor is also a very distinguished bit of pastry. The\ndome of the wheat market is an English jockey cap, on a grand scale. The\ntowers of Saint-Sulpice are two huge clarinets, and the form is as good\nas any other; the telegraph, contorted and grimacing, forms an\nadmirable accident upon their roofs. Saint-Roch has a door which, for\nmagnificence, is comparable only to that of Saint-Thomas d'Aquin. It\nhas, also, a crucifixion in high relief, in a cellar, with a sun of\ngilded wood. These things are fairly marvellous. The lantern of the\nlabyrinth of the Jardin des Plantes is also very ingenious.\n\nAs for the Palace of the Bourse, which is Greek as to its colonnade,\nRoman in the round arches of its doors and windows, of the Renaissance\nby virtue of its flattened vault, it is indubitably a very correct and\nvery pure monument; the proof is that it is crowned with an attic, such\nas was never seen in Athens, a beautiful, straight line, gracefully\nbroken here and there by stovepipes. Let us add that if it is according\nto rule that the architecture of a building should be adapted to its\npurpose in such a manner that this purpose shall be immediately apparent\nfrom the mere aspect of the building, one cannot be too much amazed at a\nstructure which might be indifferently--the palace of a king, a chamber\nof communes, a town-hall, a college, a riding-school, an academy, a\nwarehouse, a court-house, a museum, a barracks, a sepulchre, a temple,\nor a theatre. However, it is an Exchange. An edifice ought to be,\nmoreover, suitable to the climate. This one is evidently constructed\nexpressly for our cold and rainy skies. It has a roof almost as flat as\nroofs in the East, which involves sweeping the roof in winter, when it\nsnows; and of course roofs are made to be swept. As for its purpose, of\nwhich we just spoke, it fulfils it to a marvel; it is a bourse in France\nas it would have been a temple in Greece. It is true that the architect\nwas at a good deal of trouble to conceal the clock face, which would\nhave destroyed the purity of the fine lines of the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade; but, on the\nother hand, we have that colonnade which circles round the edifice and\nunder which, on days of high religious ceremony, the theories of\nthe stock-brokers and the courtiers of commerce can be developed so\nmajestically.\n\nThese are very superb structures. Let us add a quantity of fine,\namusing, and varied streets, like the Rue de Rivoli, and I do not\ndespair of Paris presenting to the eye, when viewed from a balloon, that\nrichness of line, that opulence of detail, that diversity of aspect,\nthat grandiose something in the simple, and unexpected in the beautiful,\nwhich characterizes a checker-board.\n\nHowever, admirable as the Paris of to-day may seem to you, reconstruct\nthe Paris of the fifteenth century, call it up before you in thought;\nlook at the sky athwart that surprising forest of spires, towers, and\nbelfries; spread out in the centre of the city, tear away at the point\nof the islands, fold at the arches of the bridges, the Seine, with\nits broad green and yellow expanses, more variable than the skin of a\nserpent; project clearly against an azure horizon the Gothic profile\nof this ancient Paris. Make its contour float in a winter's mist which\nclings to its numerous chimneys; drown it in profound night and watch\nthe odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices;\ncast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to\nemerge from the fog the great heads of the towers; or take that black\nsilhouette again, enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the\nspires and gables, and make it start out more toothed than a shark's jaw\nagainst a copper-colored western sky,--and then compare.\n\nAnd if you wish to receive of the ancient city an impression with which\nthe modern one can no longer furnish you, climb--on the morning of some\ngrand festival, beneath the rising sun of Easter or of Pentecost--climb\nupon some elevated point, whence you command the entire capital; and be\npresent at the wakening of the chimes. Behold, at a signal given from\nheaven, for it is the sun which gives it, all those churches quiver\nsimultaneously. First come scattered strokes, running from one church\nto another, as when musicians give warning that they are about to begin.\nThen, all at once, behold!--for it seems at times, as though the ear\nalso possessed a sight of its own,--behold, rising from each bell\ntower, something like a column of sound, a cloud of harmony. First, the\nvibration of each bell mounts straight upwards, pure and, so to speak,\nisolated from the others, into the splendid morning sky; then, little\nby little, as they swell they melt together, mingle, are lost in each\nother, and amalgamate in a magnificent concert. It is no longer anything\nbut a mass of sonorous vibrations incessantly sent forth from the\nnumerous belfries; floats, undulates, bounds, whirls over the city,\nand prolongs far beyond the horizon the deafening circle of its\noscillations.\n\nNevertheless, this sea of harmony is not a chaos; great and profound as\nit is, it has not lost its transparency; you behold the windings of\neach group of notes which escapes from the belfries. You can follow the\ndialogue, by turns grave and shrill, of the treble and the bass; you can\nsee the octaves leap from one tower to another; you watch them spring\nforth, winged, light, and whistling, from the silver bell, to fall,\nbroken and limping from the bell of wood; you admire in their midst the\nrich gamut which incessantly ascends and re-ascends the seven bells\nof Saint-Eustache; you see light and rapid notes running across it,\nexecuting three or four luminous zigzags, and vanishing like flashes\nof lightning. Yonder is the Abbey of Saint-Martin, a shrill, cracked\nsinger; here the gruff and gloomy voice of the Bastille; at the other\nend, the great tower of the Louvre, with its bass. The royal chime of\nthe palace scatters on all sides, and without relaxation, resplendent\ntrills, upon which fall, at regular intervals, the heavy strokes from\nthe belfry of Notre-Dame, which makes them sparkle like the anvil under\nthe hammer. At intervals you behold the passage of sounds of all forms\nwhich come from the triple peal of Saint-Germaine des Pr\u00c3\u00a9s. Then, again,\nfrom time to time, this mass of sublime noises opens and gives passage\nto the beats of the Ave Maria, which bursts forth and sparkles like\nan aigrette of stars. Below, in the very depths of the concert, you\nconfusedly distinguish the interior chanting of the churches, which\nexhales through the vibrating pores of their vaulted roofs.\n\nAssuredly, this is an opera which it is worth the trouble of listening\nto. Ordinarily, the noise which escapes from Paris by day is the city\nspeaking; by night, it is the city breathing; in this case, it is the\ncity singing. Lend an ear, then, to this concert of bell towers; spread\nover all the murmur of half a million men, the eternal plaint of the\nriver, the infinite breathings of the wind, the grave and distant\nquartette of the four forests arranged upon the hills, on the horizon,\nlike immense stacks of organ pipes; extinguish, as in a half shade,\nall that is too hoarse and too shrill about the central chime, and\nsay whether you know anything in the world more rich and joyful, more\ngolden, more dazzling, than this tumult of bells and chimes;--than\nthis furnace of music,--than these ten thousand brazen voices chanting\nsimultaneously in the flutes of stone, three hundred feet high,--than\nthis city which is no longer anything but an orchestra,--than this\nsymphony which produces the noise of a tempest.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. GOOD SOULS.\n\n\n\nSixteen years previous to the epoch when this story takes place, one\nfine morning, on Quasimodo Sunday, a living creature had been deposited,\nafter mass, in the church of Notre-Dame, on the wooden bed securely\nfixed in the vestibule on the left, opposite that great image of Saint\nChristopher, which the figure of Messire Antoine des Essarts, chevalier,\ncarved in stone, had been gazing at on his knees since 1413, when\nthey took it into their heads to overthrow the saint and the faithful\nfollower. Upon this bed of wood it was customary to expose foundlings\nfor public charity. Whoever cared to take them did so. In front of the\nwooden bed was a copper basin for alms.\n\nThe sort of living being which lay upon that plank on the morning of\nQuasimodo, in the year of the Lord, 1467, appeared to excite to a high\ndegree, the curiosity of the numerous group which had congregated about\nthe wooden bed. The group was formed for the most part of the fair sex.\nHardly any one was there except old women.\n\nIn the first row, and among those who were most bent over the bed, four\nwere noticeable, who, from their gray _cagoule_, a sort of cassock, were\nrecognizable as attached to some devout sisterhood. I do not see\nwhy history has not transmitted to posterity the names of these four\ndiscreet and venerable damsels. They were Agnes la Herme, Jehanne de la\nTarme, Henriette la Gaulti\u00c3\u00a8re, Gauch\u00c3\u00a8re la Violette, all four widows,\nall four dames of the Chapel Etienne Haudry, who had quitted their\nhouse with the permission of their mistress, and in conformity with the\nstatutes of Pierre d'Ailly, in order to come and hear the sermon.\n\nHowever, if these good Haudriettes were, for the moment, complying with\nthe statutes of Pierre d'Ailly, they certainly violated with joy those\nof Michel de Brache, and the Cardinal of Pisa, which so inhumanly\nenjoined silence upon them.\n\n\"What is this, sister?\" said Agnes to Gauch\u00c3\u00a8re, gazing at the little\ncreature exposed, which was screaming and writhing on the wooden bed,\nterrified by so many glances.\n\n\"What is to become of us,\" said Jehanne, \"if that is the way children\nare made now?\"\n\n\"I'm not learned in the matter of children,\" resumed Agnes, \"but it must\nbe a sin to look at this one.\"\n\n\"'Tis not a child, Agnes.\"\n\n\"'Tis an abortion of a monkey,\" remarked Gauch\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\n\"'Tis a miracle,\" interposed Henriette la Gaulti\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\n\"Then,\" remarked Agnes, \"it is the third since the Sunday of the\n_Loetare_: for, in less than a week, we had the miracle of the mocker of\npilgrims divinely punished by Notre-Dame d'Aubervilliers, and that was\nthe second miracle within a month.\"\n\n\"This pretended foundling is a real monster of abomination,\" resumed\nJehanne.\n\n\"He yells loud enough to deafen a chanter,\" continued Gauch\u00c3\u00a8re. \"Hold\nyour tongue, you little howler!\"\n\n\"To think that Monsieur of Reims sent this enormity to Monsieur of\nParis,\" added la Gaulti\u00c3\u00a8re, clasping her hands.\n\n\"I imagine,\" said Agnes la Herme, \"that it is a beast, an animal,--the\nfruit of--a Jew and a sow; something not Christian, in short, which\nought to be thrown into the fire or into the water.\"\n\n\"I really hope,\" resumed la Gaulti\u00c3\u00a8re, \"that nobody will apply for it.\"\n\n\"Ah, good heavens!\" exclaimed Agnes; \"those poor nurses yonder in the\nfoundling asylum, which forms the lower end of the lane as you go to the\nriver, just beside Monseigneur the bishop! what if this little monster\nwere to be carried to them to suckle? I'd rather give suck to a\nvampire.\"\n\n\"How innocent that poor la Herme is!\" resumed Jehanne; \"don't you see,\nsister, that this little monster is at least four years old, and that he\nwould have less appetite for your breast than for a turnspit.\"\n\nThe \"little monster\" we should find it difficult ourselves to describe\nhim otherwise, was, in fact, not a new-born child. It was a very angular\nand very lively little mass, imprisoned in its linen sack, stamped with\nthe cipher of Messire Guillaume Chartier, then bishop of Paris, with a\nhead projecting. That head was deformed enough; one beheld only a forest\nof red hair, one eye, a mouth, and teeth. The eye wept, the mouth\ncried, and the teeth seemed to ask only to be allowed to bite. The whole\nstruggled in the sack, to the great consternation of the crowd, which\nincreased and was renewed incessantly around it.\n\nDame Aloise de Gondelaurier, a rich and noble woman, who held by the\nhand a pretty girl about five or six years of age, and dragged a long\nveil about, suspended to the golden horn of her headdress, halted as she\npassed the wooden bed, and gazed for a moment at the wretched creature,\nwhile her charming little daughter, Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier,\nspelled out with her tiny, pretty finger, the permanent inscription\nattached to the wooden bed: \"Foundlings.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said the dame, turning away in disgust, \"I thought that they\nonly exposed children here.\"\n\nShe turned her back, throwing into the basin a silver florin, which rang\namong the liards, and made the poor goodwives of the chapel of Etienne\nHaudry open their eyes.\n\nA moment later, the grave and learned Robert Mistricolle, the king's\nprotonotary, passed, with an enormous missal under one arm and his wife\non the other (Damoiselle Guillemette la Mairesse), having thus by his\nside his two regulators,--spiritual and temporal.\n\n\"Foundling!\" he said, after examining the object; \"found, apparently, on\nthe banks of the river Phlegethon.\"\n\n\"One can only see one eye,\" observed Damoiselle Guillemette; \"there is a\nwart on the other.\"\n\n\"It's not a wart,\" returned Master Robert Mistricolle, \"it is an egg\nwhich contains another demon exactly similar, who bears another little\negg which contains another devil, and so on.\"\n\n\"How do you know that?\" asked Guillemette la Mairesse.\n\n\"I know it pertinently,\" replied the protonotary.\n\n\"Monsieur le protonotare,\" asked Gauch\u00c3\u00a8re, \"what do you prognosticate of\nthis pretended foundling?\"\n\n\"The greatest misfortunes,\" replied Mistricolle.\n\n\"Ah! good heavens!\" said an old woman among the spectators, \"and that\nbesides our having had a considerable pestilence last year, and that\nthey say that the English are going to disembark in a company at\nHarfleur.\"\n\n\"Perhaps that will prevent the queen from coming to Paris in the month\nof September,\" interposed another; \"trade is so bad already.\"\n\n\"My opinion is,\" exclaimed Jehanne de la Tarme, \"that it would be better\nfor the louts of Paris, if this little magician were put to bed on a\nfagot than on a plank.\"\n\n\"A fine, flaming fagot,\" added the old woman.\n\n\"It would be more prudent,\" said Mistricolle.\n\nFor several minutes, a young priest had been listening to the reasoning\nof the Haudriettes and the sentences of the notary. He had a severe\nface, with a large brow, a profound glance. He thrust the crowd silently\naside, scrutinized the \"little magician,\" and stretched out his hand\nupon him. It was high time, for all the devotees were already licking\ntheir chops over the \"fine, flaming fagot.\"\n\n\"I adopt this child,\" said the priest.\n\nHe took it in his cassock and carried it off. The spectators followed\nhim with frightened glances. A moment later, he had disappeared through\nthe \"Red Door,\" which then led from the church to the cloister.\n\nWhen the first surprise was over, Jehanne de la Tarme bent down to the\near of la Gaulti\u00c3\u00a8re,--\n\n\"I told you so, sister,--that young clerk, Monsieur Claude Frollo, is a\nsorcerer.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. CLAUDE FROLLO.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Claude Frollo was no common person.\n\nHe belonged to one of those middle-class families which were called\nindifferently, in the impertinent language of the last century, the high\n_bourgeoise_ or the petty nobility. This family had inherited from the\nbrothers Paclet the fief of Tirechappe, which was dependent upon the\nBishop of Paris, and whose twenty-one houses had been in the thirteenth\ncentury the object of so many suits before the official. As possessor of\nthis fief, Claude Frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping\nclaim to a manor in fee in Paris and its suburbs; and for a long time,\nhis name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the H\u00c3\u00b4tel\nde Tancarville, belonging to Master Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois Le Rez, and the college of\nTours, in the records deposited at Saint Martin des Champs.\n\nClaude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the\necclesiastical profession. He had been taught to read in Latin; he had\nbeen trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low. While\nstill a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in\nthe University. There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the\nlexicon.\n\nMoreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and\nlearned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed\nbut little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it\nwas to _dare alapas et capillos laniare_, and had cut no figure in that\nrevolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title\nof \"The sixth trouble of the University.\" He seldom rallied the poor\nstudents of Montaigu on the _cappettes_ from which they derived their\nname, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure,\nand their surtout parti-colored of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth,\n_azurini coloris et bruni_, as says the charter of the Cardinal des\nQuatre-Couronnes.\n\nOn the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools\nof the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais. The first pupil whom the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 de\nSaint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on\ncanon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school\nSaint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with\nhis horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee,\nand, in winter, blowing on his fingers. The first auditor whom Messire\nMiles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning,\nall breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the\nChef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo. Thus, at sixteen years of age, the\nyoung clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a\nfather of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the\ncouncils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.\n\nTheology conquered, he had plunged into decretals. From the \"Master of\nSentences,\" he had passed to the \"Capitularies of Charlemagne;\" and he\nhad devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon\ndecretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard,\nBishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal\nof Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then\nthe collection of Gregory IX.; then the Epistle of _Superspecula_, of\nHonorius III. He rendered clear and familiar to himself that vast and\ntumultuous period of civil law and canon law in conflict and at strife\nwith each other, in the chaos of the Middle Ages,--a period which Bishop\nTheodore opens in 618, and which Pope Gregory closes in 1227.\n\nDecretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts.\nHe studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an\nexpert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses. Jacques\nd' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a\nsurgeon. He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master,\nand doctor of arts. He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a\ntriple sanctuary then very little frequented. His was a veritable fever\nfor acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science. At the age of\neighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to\nthe young man that life had but one sole object: learning.\n\nIt was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466\ncaused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than\nforty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean\nde Troyes states, \"Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very\nfine man, both wise and pleasant.\" The rumor spread in the University\nthat the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady. It was\nthere that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief. The\nyoung scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion. When\nhe entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the\npreceding day. A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling\nclothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle. This was\nall that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child\nunder his arm and went off in a pensive mood. Up to that moment, he had\nlived only in science; he now began to live in life.\n\nThis catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence. Orphaned, the\neldest, head of the family at the age of nineteen, he felt himself\nrudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this\nworld. Then, moved with pity, he was seized with passion and devotion\ntowards that child, his brother; a sweet and strange thing was a human\naffection to him, who had hitherto loved his books alone.\n\nThis affection developed to a singular point; in a soul so new, it was\nlike a first love. Separated since infancy from his parents, whom he had\nhardly known; cloistered and immured, as it were, in his books; eager\nabove all things to study and to learn; exclusively attentive up to\nthat time, to his intelligence which broadened in science, to his\nimagination, which expanded in letters,--the poor scholar had not yet\nhad time to feel the place of his heart.\n\nThis young brother, without mother or father, this little child which\nhad fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms, made a new man of him.\nHe perceived that there was something else in the world besides the\nspeculations of the Sorbonne, and the verses of Homer; that man needed\naffections; that life without tenderness and without love was only a set\nof dry, shrieking, and rending wheels. Only, he imagined, for he was at\nthe age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the\naffections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a\nlittle brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.\n\nHe threw himself, therefore, into the love for his little Jehan with the\npassion of a character already profound, ardent, concentrated; that poor\nfrail creature, pretty, fair-haired, rosy, and curly,--that orphan with\nanother orphan for his only support, touched him to the bottom of his\nheart; and grave thinker as he was, he set to meditating upon Jehan\nwith an infinite compassion. He kept watch and ward over him as over\nsomething very fragile, and very worthy of care. He was more than a\nbrother to the child; he became a mother to him.\n\nLittle Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast;\nClaude gave him to a nurse. Besides the fief of Tirechappe, he had\ninherited from his father the fief of Moulin, which was a dependency of\nthe square tower of Gentilly; it was a mill on a hill, near the ch\u00c3\u00a2teau\nof Winchestre (Bic\u00c3\u00aatre). There was a miller's wife there who was nursing\na fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the\nlittle Jehan to her in his own arms.\n\nFrom that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to bear, he took life\nvery seriously. The thought of his little brother became not only his\nrecreation, but the object of his studies. He resolved to consecrate\nhimself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight\nof God, and never to have any other wife, any other child than the\nhappiness and fortune of his brother. Therefore, he attached himself\nmore closely than ever to the clerical profession. His merits, his\nlearning, his quality of immediate vassal of the Bishop of Paris, threw\nthe doors of the church wide open to him. At the age of twenty, by\nspecial dispensation of the Holy See, he was a priest, and served as\nthe youngest of the chaplains of Notre-Dame the altar which is called,\nbecause of the late mass which is said there, _altare pigrorum_.\n\nThere, plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books, which he quitted\nonly to run for an hour to the fief of Moulin, this mixture of learning\nand austerity, so rare at his age, had promptly acquired for him\nthe respect and admiration of the monastery. From the cloister, his\nreputation as a learned man had passed to the people, among whom it had\nchanged a little, a frequent occurrence at that time, into reputation as\na sorcerer.\n\nIt was at the moment when he was returning, on Quasimodo day, from\nsaying his mass at the Altar of the Lazy, which was by the side of the\ndoor leading to the nave on the right, near the image of the Virgin,\nthat his attention had been attracted by the group of old women\nchattering around the bed for foundlings.\n\nThen it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so\nhated and so menaced. That distress, that deformity, that abandonment,\nthe thought of his young brother, the idea which suddenly occurred to\nhim, that if he were to die, his dear little Jehan might also be flung\nmiserably on the plank for foundlings,--all this had gone to his heart\nsimultaneously; a great pity had moved in him, and he had carried off\nthe child.\n\nWhen he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed,\nin very sooth. The poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye, his\nhead placed directly on his shoulders, his spinal column was crooked,\nhis breast bone prominent, and his legs bowed; but he appeared to\nbe lively; and although it was impossible to say in what language\nhe lisped, his cry indicated considerable force and health. Claude's\ncompassion increased at the sight of this ugliness; and he made a vow in\nhis heart to rear the child for the love of his brother, in order that,\nwhatever might be the future faults of the little Jehan, he should have\nbeside him that charity done for his sake. It was a sort of investment\nof good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother;\nit was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for\nhim, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that\ncoin, the only sort which is received at the toll-bar of paradise.\n\nHe baptized his adopted child, and gave him the name of Quasimodo,\neither because he desired thereby to mark the day, when he had found\nhim, or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the\npoor little creature was incomplete, and hardly sketched out. In fact,\nQuasimodo, blind, hunchbacked, knock-kneed, was only an \"almost.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. _IMMANIS PECORIS CUSTOS, IMMANIOR IPSE_.\n\n\n\nNow, in 1482, Quasimodo had grown up. He had become a few years\npreviously the bellringer of Notre-Dame, thanks to his father by\nadoption, Claude Frollo,--who had become archdeacon of Josas, thanks\nto his suzerain, Messire Louis de Beaumont,--who had become Bishop of\nParis, at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472, thanks to his patron,\nOlivier Le Daim, barber to Louis XI., king by the grace of God.\n\nSo Quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of Notre-Dame.\n\nIn the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly\nintimate bond which united the ringer to the church. Separated forever\nfrom the world, by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his\nnatural deformity, imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double\ncircle, the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world\nbeyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow.\nNotre-Dame had been to him successively, as he grew up and developed,\nthe egg, the nest, the house, the country, the universe.\n\nThere was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony\nbetween this creature and this church. When, still a little fellow, he\nhad dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of\nits vaults, he seemed, with his human face and his bestial limbs, the\nnatural reptile of that humid and sombre pavement, upon which the shadow\nof the Romanesque capitals cast so many strange forms.\n\nLater on, the first time that he caught hold, mechanically, of the\nropes to the towers, and hung suspended from them, and set the bell to\nclanging, it produced upon his adopted father, Claude, the effect of a\nchild whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak.\n\nIt is thus that, little by little, developing always in sympathy with\nthe cathedral, living there, sleeping there, hardly ever leaving it,\nsubject every hour to the mysterious impress, he came to resemble it, he\nincrusted himself in it, so to speak, and became an integral part of it.\nHis salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral\n(if we may be allowed this figure of speech), and he seemed not only its\ninhabitant but more than that, its natural tenant. One might almost\nsay that he had assumed its form, as the snail takes on the form of\nits shell. It was his dwelling, his hole, his envelope. There existed\nbetween him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy, so\nmany magnetic affinities, so many material affinities, that he adhered\nto it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell. The rough and\nwrinkled cathedral was his shell.\n\nIt is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the\nsimiles which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular,\nsymmetrical, direct, almost consubstantial union of a man and an\nedifice. It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that\nwhole cathedral was familiar to him, after so long and so intimate a\ncohabitation. That dwelling was peculiar to him. It had no depths to\nwhich Quasimodo had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled.\nHe often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven\npoints of the carving. The towers, on whose exterior surface he was\nfrequently seen clambering, like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular\nwall, those two gigantic twins, so lofty, so menacing, so formidable,\npossessed for him neither vertigo, nor terror, nor shocks of amazement.\n\nTo see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have\nsaid that he had tamed them. By dint of leaping, climbing, gambolling\namid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become, in some sort,\na monkey and a goat, like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks,\nand plays with the sea while still a babe.\n\nMoreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the\nCathedral, but his mind also. In what condition was that mind? What\nbent had it contracted, what form had it assumed beneath that knotted\nenvelope, in that savage life? This it would be hard to determine.\nQuasimodo had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame. It was with\ngreat difficulty, and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had\nsucceeded in teaching him to talk. But a fatality was attached to the\npoor foundling. Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen, a new\ninfirmity had come to complete his misfortunes: the bells had broken the\ndrums of his ears; he had become deaf. The only gate which nature had\nleft wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.\n\nIn closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still\nmade its way into the soul of Quasimodo. His soul fell into profound\nnight. The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete\nas his deformity. Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some\nextent dumb. For, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment\nthat he found himself to be deaf, he resolved upon a silence which he\nonly broke when he was alone. He voluntarily tied that tongue which\nClaude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose. Hence, it came about,\nthat when necessity constrained him to speak, his tongue was torpid,\nawkward, and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty.\n\nIf now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that\nthick, hard rind; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed\norganism; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those\nnon-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque\ncreature, to elucidate his obscure corners, his absurd no-thoroughfares,\nand suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the\nextremity of that cave, we should, no doubt, find the unhappy Psyche in\nsome poor, cramped, and ricketty attitude, like those prisoners beneath\nthe Leads of Venice, who grew old bent double in a stone box which was\nboth too low and too short for them.\n\nIt is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body.\nQuasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image, moving\nblindly within him. The impressions of objects underwent a considerable\nrefraction before reaching his mind. His brain was a peculiar medium;\nthe ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted.\nThe reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily,\ndivergent and perverted.\n\nHence a thousand optical illusions, a thousand aberrations of judgment,\na thousand deviations, in which his thought strayed, now mad, now\nidiotic.\n\nThe first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance\nwhich he cast upon things. He received hardly any immediate perception\nof them. The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does\nto us.\n\nThe second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious.\n\nHe was malicious, in fact, because he was savage; he was savage because\nhe was ugly. There was logic in his nature, as there is in ours.\n\nHis strength, so extraordinarily developed, was a cause of still greater\nmalevolence: \"_Malus puer robustus_,\" says Hobbes.\n\nThis justice must, however be rendered to him. Malevolence was not,\nperhaps, innate in him. From his very first steps among men, he had felt\nhimself, later on he had seen himself, spewed out, blasted, rejected.\nHuman words were, for him, always a raillery or a malediction. As he\ngrew up, he had found nothing but hatred around him. He had caught the\ngeneral malevolence. He had picked up the weapon with which he had been\nwounded.\n\nAfter all, he turned his face towards men only with reluctance;\nhis cathedral was sufficient for him. It was peopled with marble\nfigures,--kings, saints, bishops,--who at least did not burst out\nlaughing in his face, and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity\nand kindliness. The other statues, those of the monsters and demons,\ncherished no hatred for him, Quasimodo. He resembled them too much for\nthat. They seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men. The saints were\nhis friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded\nhim. So he held long communion with them. He sometimes passed whole\nhours crouching before one of these statues, in solitary conversation\nwith it. If any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his\nserenade.\n\nAnd the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and\nall nature beside. He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted\nwindows, always in flower; no other shade than that of the foliage of\nstone which spread out, loaded with birds, in the tufts of the Saxon\ncapitals; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church;\nof no other ocean than Paris, roaring at their bases.\n\nWhat he loved above all else in the maternal edifice, that which aroused\nhis soul, and made it open its poor wings, which it kept so miserably\nfolded in its cavern, that which sometimes rendered him even happy, was\nthe bells. He loved them, fondled them, talked to them, understood them.\nFrom the chime in the spire, over the intersection of the aisles and\nnave, to the great bell of the front, he cherished a tenderness for them\nall. The central spire and the two towers were to him as three great\ncages, whose birds, reared by himself, sang for him alone. Yet it was\nthese very bells which had made him deaf; but mothers often love best\nthat child which has caused them the most suffering.\n\nIt is true that their voice was the only one which he could still\nhear. On this score, the big bell was his beloved. It was she whom he\npreferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above\nhim, on festival days. This bell was named Marie. She was alone in the\nsouthern tower, with her sister Jacqueline, a bell of lesser size, shut\nup in a smaller cage beside hers. This Jacqueline was so called from the\nname of the wife of Jean Montagu, who had given it to the church, which\nhad not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on.\nIn the second tower there were six other bells, and, finally, six\nsmaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing, with the wooden\nbell, which rang only between after dinner on Good Friday and the\nmorning of the day before Easter. So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his\nseraglio; but big Marie was his favorite.\n\nNo idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was\nsounded. At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him, and said,\n\"Go!\" he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any\none else could have descended it. He entered perfectly breathless into\nthe aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly\nand lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his\nhand, like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey.\nHe pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer. After these\nfirst caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story\nof the tower, to begin. They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the\nenormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion. Quasimodo followed\nit with his glance and trembled. The first shock of the clapper and\nthe brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver.\nQuasimodo vibrated with the bell.\n\n\"Vah!\" he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter. However, the\nmovement of the bass was accelerated, and, in proportion as it described\na wider angle, Quasimodo's eye opened also more and more widely,\nphosphoric and flaming. At length the grand peal began; the whole tower\ntrembled; woodwork, leads, cut stones, all groaned at once, from the\npiles of the foundation to the trefoils of its summit. Then Quasimodo\nboiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with\nthe tower. The bell, furious, running riot, presented to the two\nwalls of the tower alternately its brazen throat, whence escaped that\ntempestuous breath, which is audible leagues away. Quasimodo stationed\nhimself in front of this open throat; he crouched and rose with the\noscillations of the bell, breathed in this overwhelming breath, gazed\nby turns at the deep place, which swarmed with people, two hundred feet\nbelow him, and at that enormous, brazen tongue which came, second after\nsecond, to howl in his ear.\n\nIt was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke\nfor him the universal silence. He swelled out in it as a bird does in\nthe sun. All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his\nlook became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it\npassed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly\nupon it, with might and main. Then, suspended above the abyss, borne\nto and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen\nmonster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on\nwith his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock\nand weight of his body. Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and\ngnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a\nbellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting,\nbeneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre-Dame nor\nQuasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted\nastride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange\ncentaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away\nupon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.\n\nThe presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of\nlife to circulate throughout the entire cathedral. It seemed as though\nthere escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions\nof the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of\nNotre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate.\nIt sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe\nthat they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in\nmotion. And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature\nbeneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it\nwas possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit.\nOne would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe. He was\neverywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the\nstructure. Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of\nthe towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all\nfours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to\nprojection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it\nwas Quasimodo dislodging the crows. Again, in some obscure corner of the\nchurch one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching\nand scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought. Sometimes one caught\nsight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered\nlimbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing\nvespers or the Angelus. Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering\nalong the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers\nand borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of\nNotre-Dame. Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church\ntook on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths\nwere opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the\ngargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched\nneck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking. And, if\nit was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the\ndeath rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air\nwas spread over the sombre fa\u00c3\u00a7ade that one would have declared that\nthe grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was\nwatching it. And all this came from Quasimodo. Egypt would have taken\nhim for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed him to be its\ndemon: he was in fact its soul.\n\nTo such an extent was this disease that for those who know that\nQuasimodo has existed, Notre-Dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead.\nOne feels that something has disappeared from it. That immense body is\nempty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has quitted it, one sees its place\nand that is all. It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes,\nbut no longer sight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE DOG AND HIS MASTER.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, there was one human creature whom Quasimodo excepted from\nhis malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more,\nperhaps, than his cathedral: this was Claude Frollo.\n\nThe matter was simple; Claude Frollo had taken him in, had adopted him,\nhad nourished him, had reared him. When a little lad, it was between\nClaude Frollo's legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the\ndogs and the children barked after him. Claude Frollo had taught him\nto talk, to read, to write. Claude Frollo had finally made him the\nbellringer. Now, to give the big bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to\ngive Juliet to Romeo.\n\nHence Quasimodo's gratitude was profound, passionate, boundless; and\nalthough the visage of his adopted father was often clouded or severe,\nalthough his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that\ngratitude never wavered for a single moment. The archdeacon had in\nQuasimodo the most submissive slave, the most docile lackey, the most\nvigilant of dogs. When the poor bellringer became deaf, there had\nbeen established between him and Claude Frollo, a language of signs,\nmysterious and understood by themselves alone. In this manner the\narchdeacon was the sole human being with whom Quasimodo had preserved\ncommunication. He was in sympathy with but two things in this world:\nNotre-Dame and Claude Frollo.\n\nThere is nothing which can be compared with the empire of the archdeacon\nover the bellringer; with the attachment of the bellringer for the\narchdeacon. A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would\nhave sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of\nNotre-Dame. It was a remarkable thing--all that physical strength which\nhad reached in Quasimodo such an extraordinary development, and which\nwas placed by him blindly at the disposition of another. There was in\nit, no doubt, filial devotion, domestic attachment; there was also the\nfascination of one spirit by another spirit. It was a poor, awkward, and\nclumsy organization, which stood with lowered head and supplicating eyes\nbefore a lofty and profound, a powerful and superior intellect. Lastly,\nand above all, it was gratitude. Gratitude so pushed to its extremest\nlimit, that we do not know to what to compare it. This virtue is not one\nof those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men. We\nwill say then, that Quasimodo loved the archdeacon as never a dog, never\na horse, never an elephant loved his master.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. MORE ABOUT CLAUDE FROLLO.\n\n\n\nIn 1482, Quasimodo was about twenty years of age; Claude Frollo, about\nthirty-six. One had grown up, the other had grown old.\n\nClaude Frollo was no longer the simple scholar of the college of Torch,\nthe tender protector of a little child, the young and dreamy philosopher\nwho knew many things and was ignorant of many. He was a priest, austere,\ngrave, morose; one charged with souls; monsieur the archdeacon of Josas,\nthe bishop's second acolyte, having charge of the two deaneries of\nMontlh\u00c3\u00a9ry, and Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaufort, and one hundred and seventy-four country\ncuracies. He was an imposing and sombre personage, before whom the choir\nboys in alb and in jacket trembled, as well as the machicots*, and the\nbrothers of Saint-Augustine and the matutinal clerks of Notre-Dame,\nwhen he passed slowly beneath the lofty arches of the choir, majestic,\nthoughtful, with arms folded and his head so bent upon his breast that\nall one saw of his face was his large, bald brow.\n\n\n     *  An official of Notre-Dame, lower than a beneficed clergyman,\nhigher than simple paid chanters.\n\n\nDom Claude Frollo had, however, abandoned neither science nor the\neducation of his young brother, those two occupations of his life. But\nas time went on, some bitterness had been mingled with these things\nwhich were so sweet. In the long run, says Paul Diacre, the best lard\nturns rancid. Little Jehan Frollo, surnamed (_du Moulin_) \"of the Mill\"\nbecause of the place where he had been reared, had not grown up in the\ndirection which Claude would have liked to impose upon him. The big\nbrother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil. But\nthe little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener's\nhopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and\nair, the little brother did not grow and did not multiply, but only\nput forth fine bushy and luxuriant branches on the side of laziness,\nignorance, and debauchery. He was a regular devil, and a very disorderly\none, who made Dom Claude scowl; but very droll and very subtle, which\nmade the big brother smile.\n\nClaude had confided him to that same college of Torchi where he had\npassed his early years in study and meditation; and it was a grief to\nhim that this sanctuary, formerly edified by the name of Frollo, should\nto-day be scandalized by it. He sometimes preached Jehan very long and\nsevere sermons, which the latter intrepidly endured. After all, the\nyoung scapegrace had a good heart, as can be seen in all comedies.\nBut the sermon over, he none the less tranquilly resumed his course of\nseditions and enormities. Now it was a _bejaune_ or yellow beak (as they\ncalled the new arrivals at the university), whom he had been mauling by\nway of welcome; a precious tradition which has been carefully preserved\nto our own day. Again, he had set in movement a band of scholars,\nwho had flung themselves upon a wine-shop in classic fashion, quasi\n_classico excitati_, had then beaten the tavern-keeper \"with offensive\ncudgels,\" and joyously pillaged the tavern, even to smashing in the\nhogsheads of wine in the cellar. And then it was a fine report in Latin,\nwhich the sub-monitor of Torchi carried piteously to Dom Claude with\nthis dolorous marginal comment,--_Rixa; prima causa vinum optimum\npotatum_. Finally, it was said, a thing quite horrible in a boy of\nsixteen, that his debauchery often extended as far as the Rue de\nGlatigny.\n\nClaude, saddened and discouraged in his human affections, by all this,\nhad flung himself eagerly into the arms of learning, that sister which,\nat least does not laugh in your face, and which always pays you, though\nin money that is sometimes a little hollow, for the attention which you\nhave paid to her. Hence, he became more and more learned, and, at the\nsame time, as a natural consequence, more and more rigid as a\npriest, more and more sad as a man. There are for each of us several\nparallelisms between our intelligence, our habits, and our character,\nwhich develop without a break, and break only in the great disturbances\nof life.\n\nAs Claude Frollo had passed through nearly the entire circle of human\nlearning--positive, exterior, and permissible--since his youth, he\nwas obliged, unless he came to a halt, _ubi defuit orbis_, to proceed\nfurther and seek other aliments for the insatiable activity of his\nintelligence. The antique symbol of the serpent biting its tail is,\nabove all, applicable to science. It would appear that Claude Frollo had\nexperienced this. Many grave persons affirm that, after having exhausted\nthe _fas_ of human learning, he had dared to penetrate into the _nefas_.\nHe had, they said, tasted in succession all the apples of the tree of\nknowledge, and, whether from hunger or disgust, had ended by tasting\nthe forbidden fruit. He had taken his place by turns, as the reader\nhas seen, in the conferences of the theologians in Sorbonne,--in the\nassemblies of the doctors of art, after the manner of Saint-Hilaire,--in\nthe disputes of the decretalists, after the manner of Saint-Martin,--in\nthe congregations of physicians at the holy water font of Notre-Dame,\n_ad cupam Nostroe-Dominoe_. All the dishes permitted and approved, which\nthose four great kitchens called the four faculties could elaborate and\nserve to the understanding, he had devoured, and had been satiated with\nthem before his hunger was appeased. Then he had penetrated further,\nlower, beneath all that finished, material, limited knowledge; he had,\nperhaps, risked his soul, and had seated himself in the cavern at\nthat mysterious table of the alchemists, of the astrologers, of the\nhermetics, of which Averro\u00c3\u00a8s, Gillaume de Paris, and Nicolas Flamel hold\nthe end in the Middle Ages; and which extends in the East, by the\nlight of the seven-branched candlestick, to Solomon, Pythagoras, and\nZoroaster.\n\nThat is, at least, what was supposed, whether rightly or not. It\nis certain that the archdeacon often visited the cemetery of the\nSaints-Innocents, where, it is true, his father and mother had been\nburied, with other victims of the plague of 1466; but that he appeared\nfar less devout before the cross of their grave than before the strange\nfigures with which the tomb of Nicolas Flamel and Claude Pernelle,\nerected just beside it, was loaded.\n\nIt is certain that he had frequently been seen to pass along the Rue des\nLombards, and furtively enter a little house which formed the corner\nof the Rue des Ecrivans and the Rue Marivault. It was the house which\nNicolas Flamel had built, where he had died about 1417, and which,\nconstantly deserted since that time, had already begun to fall in\nruins,--so greatly had the hermetics and the alchemists of all countries\nwasted away the walls, merely by carving their names upon them. Some\nneighbors even affirm that they had once seen, through an air-hole,\nArchdeacon Claude excavating, turning over, digging up the earth in the\ntwo cellars, whose supports had been daubed with numberless couplets and\nhieroglyphics by Nicolas Flamel himself. It was supposed that Flamel had\nburied the philosopher's stone in the cellar; and the alchemists, for\nthe space of two centuries, from Magistri to Father Pacifique, never\nceased to worry the soil until the house, so cruelly ransacked and\nturned over, ended by falling into dust beneath their feet.\n\nAgain, it is certain that the archdeacon had been seized with a singular\npassion for the symbolical door of Notre-Dame, that page of a conjuring\nbook written in stone, by Bishop Guillaume de Paris, who has, no doubt,\nbeen damned for having affixed so infernal a frontispiece to the sacred\npoem chanted by the rest of the edifice. Archdeacon Claude had the\ncredit also of having fathomed the mystery of the colossus of Saint\nChristopher, and of that lofty, enigmatical statue which then stood at\nthe entrance of the vestibule, and which the people, in derision,\ncalled \"Monsieur Legris.\" But, what every one might have noticed was the\ninterminable hours which he often employed, seated upon the parapet of\nthe area in front of the church, in contemplating the sculptures of the\nfront; examining now the foolish virgins with their lamps reversed, now\nthe wise virgins with their lamps upright; again, calculating the angle\nof vision of that raven which belongs to the left front, and which is\nlooking at a mysterious point inside the church, where is concealed the\nphilosopher's stone, if it be not in the cellar of Nicolas Flamel.\n\nIt was, let us remark in passing, a singular fate for the Church of\nNotre-Dame at that epoch to be so beloved, in two different degrees,\nand with so much devotion, by two beings so dissimilar as Claude and\nQuasimodo. Beloved by one, a sort of instinctive and savage half-man,\nfor its beauty, for its stature, for the harmonies which emanated from\nits magnificent ensemble; beloved by the other, a learned and passionate\nimagination, for its myth, for the sense which it contains, for the\nsymbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its front,--like the first\ntext underneath the second in a palimpsest,--in a word, for the enigma\nwhich it is eternally propounding to the understanding.\n\nFurthermore, it is certain that the archdeacon had established himself\nin that one of the two towers which looks upon the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, just beside\nthe frame for the bells, a very secret little cell, into which no one,\nnot even the bishop, entered without his leave, it was said. This tiny\ncell had formerly been made almost at the summit of the tower, among the\nravens' nests, by Bishop Hugo de Besan\u00c3\u00a7on* who had wrought sorcery there\nin his day. What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand\nof the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear,\nand reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little dormer window\nopening upon the back of the tower, a certain red, intermittent,\nsingular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows,\nand to proceed from a flame, rather than from a light. In the darkness,\nat that height, it produced a singular effect; and the goodwives said:\n\"There's the archdeacon blowing! hell is sparkling up yonder!\"\n\n\n     *  Hugo II. de Bisuncio, 1326-1332.\n\n\nThere were no great proofs of sorcery in that, after all, but there was\nstill enough smoke to warrant a surmise of fire, and the archdeacon bore\na tolerably formidable reputation. We ought to mention however, that the\nsciences of Egypt, that necromancy and magic, even the whitest, even the\nmost innocent, had no more envenomed enemy, no more pitiless denunciator\nbefore the gentlemen of the officialty of Notre-Dame. Whether this\nwas sincere horror, or the game played by the thief who shouts, \"stop\nthief!\" at all events, it did not prevent the archdeacon from being\nconsidered by the learned heads of the chapter, as a soul who had\nventured into the vestibule of hell, who was lost in the caves of the\ncabal, groping amid the shadows of the occult sciences. Neither were\nthe people deceived thereby; with any one who possessed any sagacity,\nQuasimodo passed for the demon; Claude Frollo, for the sorcerer. It\nwas evident that the bellringer was to serve the archdeacon for a given\ntime, at the end of which he would carry away the latter's soul, by way\nof payment. Thus the archdeacon, in spite of the excessive austerity of\nhis life, was in bad odor among all pious souls; and there was no devout\nnose so inexperienced that it could not smell him out to be a magician.\n\nAnd if, as he grew older, abysses had formed in his science, they had\nalso formed in his heart. That at least, is what one had grounds for\nbelieving on scrutinizing that face upon which the soul was only seen\nto shine through a sombre cloud. Whence that large, bald brow? that head\nforever bent? that breast always heaving with sighs? What secret thought\ncaused his mouth to smile with so much bitterness, at the same moment\nthat his scowling brows approached each other like two bulls on the\npoint of fighting? Why was what hair he had left already gray? What was\nthat internal fire which sometimes broke forth in his glance, to such a\ndegree that his eye resembled a hole pierced in the wall of a furnace?\n\nThese symptoms of a violent moral preoccupation, had acquired an\nespecially high degree of intensity at the epoch when this story takes\nplace. More than once a choir-boy had fled in terror at finding him\nalone in the church, so strange and dazzling was his look. More than\nonce, in the choir, at the hour of the offices, his neighbor in the\nstalls had heard him mingle with the plain song, _ad omnem tonum_,\nunintelligible parentheses. More than once the laundress of the Terrain\ncharged \"with washing the chapter\" had observed, not without affright,\nthe marks of nails and clenched fingers on the surplice of monsieur the\narchdeacon of Josas.\n\nHowever, he redoubled his severity, and had never been more exemplary.\nBy profession as well as by character, he had always held himself aloof\nfrom women; he seemed to hate them more than ever. The mere rustling\nof a silken petticoat caused his hood to fall over his eyes. Upon this\nscore he was so jealous of austerity and reserve, that when the Dame de\nBeaujeu, the king's daughter, came to visit the cloister of Notre-Dame,\nin the month of December, 1481, he gravely opposed her entrance,\nreminding the bishop of the statute of the Black Book, dating from the\nvigil of Saint-Barth\u00c3\u00a9lemy, 1334, which interdicts access to the cloister\nto \"any woman whatever, old or young, mistress or maid.\" Upon which the\nbishop had been constrained to recite to him the ordinance of Legate\nOdo, which excepts certain great dames, _aliqu\u00c3\u00a6 magnates mulieres,\nqu\u00c3\u00a6 sine scandalo vitari non possunt_. And again the archdeacon had\nprotested, objecting that the ordinance of the legate, which dated back\nto 1207, was anterior by a hundred and twenty-seven years to the Black\nBook, and consequently was abrogated in fact by it. And he had refused\nto appear before the princess.\n\nIt was also noticed that his horror for Bohemian women and gypsies had\nseemed to redouble for some time past. He had petitioned the bishop for\nan edict which expressly forbade the Bohemian women to come and dance\nand beat their tambourines on the place of the Parvis; and for about the\nsame length of time, he had been ransacking the mouldy placards of\nthe officialty, in order to collect the cases of sorcerers and witches\ncondemned to fire or the rope, for complicity in crimes with rams, sows,\nor goats.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. UNPOPULARITY.\n\n\n\nThe archdeacon and the bellringer, as we have already said, were but\nlittle loved by the populace great and small, in the vicinity of the\ncathedral. When Claude and Quasimodo went out together, which frequently\nhappened, and when they were seen traversing in company, the valet\nbehind the master, the cold, narrow, and gloomy streets of the block of\nNotre-Dame, more than one evil word, more than one ironical quaver, more\nthan one insulting jest greeted them on their way, unless Claude Frollo,\nwhich was rarely the case, walked with head upright and raised, showing\nhis severe and almost august brow to the dumbfounded jeerers.\n\nBoth were in their quarter like \"the poets\" of whom R\u00c3\u00a9gnier speaks,--\n\n\n   \"All sorts of persons run after poets,\n   As warblers fly shrieking after owls.\"\n\n\nSometimes a mischievous child risked his skin and bones for the\nineffable pleasure of driving a pin into Quasimodo's hump. Again, a\nyoung girl, more bold and saucy than was fitting, brushed the priest's\nblack robe, singing in his face the sardonic ditty, \"niche, niche, the\ndevil is caught.\" Sometimes a group of squalid old crones, squatting in\na file under the shadow of the steps to a porch, scolded noisily as the\narchdeacon and the bellringer passed, and tossed them this encouraging\nwelcome, with a curse: \"Hum! there's a fellow whose soul is made like\nthe other one's body!\" Or a band of schoolboys and street urchins,\nplaying hop-scotch, rose in a body and saluted him classically, with\nsome cry in Latin: \"_Eia! eia! Claudius cum claudo_!\"\n\nBut the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the\nbellringer. Quasimodo was too deaf to hear all these gracious things,\nand Claude was too dreamy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. _ABBAS BEATI MARTINI_.\n\n\n\nDom Claude's fame had spread far and wide. It procured for him, at about\nthe epoch when he refused to see Madame de Beaujeu, a visit which he\nlong remembered.\n\nIt was in the evening. He had just retired, after the office, to\nhis canon's cell in the cloister of Notre-Dame. This cell, with the\nexception, possibly, of some glass phials, relegated to a corner, and\nfilled with a decidedly equivocal powder, which strongly resembled\nthe alchemist's \"powder of projection,\" presented nothing strange or\nmysterious. There were, indeed, here and there, some inscriptions on\nthe walls, but they were pure sentences of learning and piety, extracted\nfrom good authors. The archdeacon had just seated himself, by the\nlight of a three-jetted copper lamp, before a vast coffer crammed with\nmanuscripts. He had rested his elbow upon the open volume of _Honorius\nd'Autun_, _De predestinatione et libero arbitrio_, and he was turning\nover, in deep meditation, the leaves of a printed folio which he had\njust brought, the sole product of the press which his cell contained. In\nthe midst of his revery there came a knock at his door. \"Who's there?\"\ncried the learned man, in the gracious tone of a famished dog, disturbed\nover his bone.\n\nA voice without replied, \"Your friend, Jacques Coictier.\" He went to\nopen the door.\n\nIt was, in fact, the king's physician; a person about fifty years of\nage, whose harsh physiognomy was modified only by a crafty eye. Another\nman accompanied him. Both wore long slate-colored robes, furred with\nminever, girded and closed, with caps of the same stuff and hue. Their\nhands were concealed by their sleeves, their feet by their robes, their\neyes by their caps.\n\n\"God help me, messieurs!\" said the archdeacon, showing them in; \"I\nwas not expecting distinguished visitors at such an hour.\" And while\nspeaking in this courteous fashion he cast an uneasy and scrutinizing\nglance from the physician to his companion.\n\n\"'Tis never too late to come and pay a visit to so considerable\na learned man as Dom Claude Frollo de Tirechappe,\" replied Doctor\nCoictier, whose Franche-Comt\u00c3\u00a9 accent made all his phrases drag along\nwith the majesty of a train-robe.\n\nThere then ensued between the physician and the archdeacon one of those\ncongratulatory prologues which, in accordance with custom, at that\nepoch preceded all conversations between learned men, and which did not\nprevent them from detesting each other in the most cordial manner in\nthe world. However, it is the same nowadays; every wise man's mouth\ncomplimenting another wise man is a vase of honeyed gall.\n\nClaude Frollo's felicitations to Jacques Coictier bore reference\nprincipally to the temporal advantages which the worthy physician had\nfound means to extract, in the course of his much envied career, from\neach malady of the king, an operation of alchemy much better and more\ncertain than the pursuit of the philosopher's stone.\n\n\"In truth, Monsieur le Docteur Coictier, I felt great joy on learning of\nthe bishopric given your nephew, my reverend seigneur Pierre Verse. Is\nhe not Bishop of Amiens?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur Archdeacon; it is a grace and mercy of God.\"\n\n\"Do you know that you made a great figure on Christmas Day at the bead\nof your company of the chamber of accounts, Monsieur President?\"\n\n\"Vice-President, Dom Claude. Alas! nothing more.\"\n\n\"How is your superb house in the Rue Saint-Andr\u00c3\u00a9 des Arcs coming on?\n'Tis a Louvre. I love greatly the apricot tree which is carved on the\ndoor, with this play of words: 'A L'ABRI-COTIER--Sheltered from reefs.'\"\n\n\"Alas! Master Claude, all that masonry costeth me dear. In proportion as\nthe house is erected, I am ruined.\"\n\n\"Ho! have you not your revenues from the jail, and the bailiwick of the\nPalais, and the rents of all the houses, sheds, stalls, and booths of\nthe enclosure? 'Tis a fine breast to suck.\"\n\n\"My castellany of Poissy has brought me in nothing this year.\"\n\n\"But your tolls of Triel, of Saint-James, of Saint-Germainen-Laye are\nalways good.\"\n\n\"Six score livres, and not even Parisian livres at that.\"\n\n\"You have your office of counsellor to the king. That is fixed.\"\n\n\"Yes, brother Claude; but that accursed seigneury of Poligny, which\npeople make so much noise about, is worth not sixty gold crowns, year\nout and year in.\"\n\nIn the compliments which Dom Claude addressed to Jacques Coictier, there\nwas that sardonical, biting, and covertly mocking accent, and the sad\ncruel smile of a superior and unhappy man who toys for a moment, by way\nof distraction, with the dense prosperity of a vulgar man. The other did\nnot perceive it.\n\n\"Upon my soul,\" said Claude at length, pressing his hand, \"I am glad to\nsee you and in such good health.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Master Claude.\"\n\n\"By the way,\" exclaimed Dom Claude, \"how is your royal patient?\"\n\n\"He payeth not sufficiently his physician,\" replied the doctor, casting\na side glance at his companion.\n\n\"Think you so, Gossip Coictier,\" said the latter.\n\nThese words, uttered in a tone of surprise and reproach, drew upon this\nunknown personage the attention of the archdeacon which, to tell the\ntruth, had not been diverted from him a single moment since the stranger\nhad set foot across the threshold of his cell. It had even required all\nthe thousand reasons which he had for handling tenderly Doctor Jacques\nCoictier, the all-powerful physician of King Louis XI., to induce him\nto receive the latter thus accompanied. Hence, there was nothing very\ncordial in his manner when Jacques Coictier said to him,--\n\n\"By the way, Dom Claude, I bring you a colleague who has desired to see\nyou on account of your reputation.\"\n\n\"Monsieur belongs to science?\" asked the archdeacon, fixing his piercing\neye upon Coictier's companion. He found beneath the brows of the\nstranger a glance no less piercing or less distrustful than his own.\n\nHe was, so far as the feeble light of the lamp permitted one to judge,\nan old man about sixty years of age and of medium stature, who appeared\nsomewhat sickly and broken in health. His profile, although of a very\nordinary outline, had something powerful and severe about it; his eyes\nsparkled beneath a very deep superciliary arch, like a light in the\ndepths of a cave; and beneath his cap which was well drawn down and fell\nupon his nose, one recognized the broad expanse of a brow of genius.\n\nHe took it upon himself to reply to the archdeacon's question,--\n\n\"Reverend master,\" he said in a grave tone, \"your renown has reached my\nears, and I wish to consult you. I am but a poor provincial gentleman,\nwho removeth his shoes before entering the dwellings of the learned. You\nmust know my name. I am called Gossip Tourangeau.\"\n\n\"Strange name for a gentleman,\" said the archdeacon to himself.\n\nNevertheless, he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong\nand earnest character. The instinct of his own lofty intellect made him\nrecognize an intellect no less lofty under Gossip Tourangeau's furred\ncap, and as he gazed at the solemn face, the ironical smile which\nJacques Coictier's presence called forth on his gloomy face, gradually\ndisappeared as twilight fades on the horizon of night. Stern and silent,\nhe had resumed his seat in his great armchair; his elbow rested as\nusual, on the table, and his brow on his hand. After a few moments\nof reflection, he motioned his visitors to be seated, and, turning to\nGossip Tourangeau he said,--\n\n\"You come to consult me, master, and upon what science?\"\n\n\"Your reverence,\" replied Tourangeau, \"I am ill, very ill. You are said\nto be great AEsculapius, and I am come to ask your advice in medicine.\"\n\n\"Medicine!\" said the archdeacon, tossing his head. He seemed to meditate\nfor a moment, and then resumed: \"Gossip Tourangeau, since that is your\nname, turn your head, you will find my reply already written on the\nwall.\"\n\nGossip Tourangeau obeyed, and read this inscription engraved above his\nhead: \"Medicine is the daughter of dreams.--JAMBLIQUE.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Doctor Jacques Coictier had heard his companion's question\nwith a displeasure which Dom Claude's response had but redoubled. He\nbent down to the ear of Gossip Tourangeau, and said to him, softly\nenough not to be heard by the archdeacon: \"I warned you that he was mad.\nYou insisted on seeing him.\"\n\n\"'Tis very possible that he is right, madman as he is, Doctor Jacques,\"\nreplied his comrade in the same low tone, and with a bitter smile.\n\n\"As you please,\" replied Coictier dryly. Then, addressing the\narchdeacon: \"You are clever at your trade, Dom Claude, and you are no\nmore at a loss over Hippocrates than a monkey is over a nut. Medicine\na dream! I suspect that the pharmacopolists and the master physicians\nwould insist upon stoning you if they were here. So you deny the\ninfluence of philtres upon the blood, and unguents on the skin! You deny\nthat eternal pharmacy of flowers and metals, which is called the world,\nmade expressly for that eternal invalid called man!\"\n\n\"I deny,\" said Dom Claude coldly, \"neither pharmacy nor the invalid. I\nreject the physician.\"\n\n\"Then it is not true,\" resumed Coictier hotly, \"that gout is an internal\neruption; that a wound caused by artillery is to be cured by the\napplication of a young mouse roasted; that young blood, properly\ninjected, restores youth to aged veins; it is not true that two and two\nmake four, and that emprostathonos follows opistathonos.\"\n\nThe archdeacon replied without perturbation: \"There are certain things\nof which I think in a certain fashion.\"\n\nCoictier became crimson with anger.\n\n\"There, there, my good Coictier, let us not get angry,\" said Gossip\nTourangeau. \"Monsieur the archdeacon is our friend.\"\n\nCoictier calmed down, muttering in a low tone,--\n\n\"After all, he's mad.\"\n\n\"_Pasque-dieu_, Master Claude,\" resumed Gossip Tourangeau, after a\nsilence, \"You embarrass me greatly. I had two things to consult you\nupon, one touching my health and the other touching my star.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" returned the archdeacon, \"if that be your motive, you\nwould have done as well not to put yourself out of breath climbing my\nstaircase. I do not believe in Medicine. I do not believe in Astrology.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the man, with surprise.\n\nCoictier gave a forced laugh.\n\n\"You see that he is mad,\" he said, in a low tone, to Gossip Tourangeau.\n\"He does not believe in astrology.\"\n\n\"The idea of imagining,\" pursued Dom Claude, \"that every ray of a star\nis a thread which is fastened to the head of a man!\"\n\n\"And what then, do you believe in?\" exclaimed Gossip Tourangeau.\n\nThe archdeacon hesitated for a moment, then he allowed a gloomy smile to\nescape, which seemed to give the lie to his response: \"_Credo in Deum_.\"\n\n\"_Dominum nostrum_,\" added Gossip Tourangeau, making the sign of the\ncross.\n\n\"Amen,\" said Coictier.\n\n\"Reverend master,\" resumed Tourangeau, \"I am charmed in soul to see you\nin such a religious frame of mind. But have you reached the point, great\nsavant as you are, of no longer believing in science?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the archdeacon, grasping the arm of Gossip Tourangeau, and\na ray of enthusiasm lighted up his gloomy eyes, \"no, I do not reject\nscience. I have not crawled so long, flat on my belly, with my nails in\nthe earth, through the innumerable ramifications of its caverns, without\nperceiving far in front of me, at the end of the obscure gallery, a\nlight, a flame, a something, the reflection, no doubt, of the dazzling\ncentral laboratory where the patient and the wise have found out God.\"\n\n\"And in short,\" interrupted Tourangeau, \"what do you hold to be true and\ncertain?\"\n\n\"Alchemy.\"\n\nCoictier exclaimed, \"Pardieu, Dom Claude, alchemy has its use, no doubt,\nbut why blaspheme medicine and astrology?\"\n\n\"Naught is your science of man, naught is your science of the stars,\"\nsaid the archdeacon, commandingly.\n\n\"That's driving Epidaurus and Chaldea very fast,\" replied the physician\nwith a grin.\n\n\"Listen, Messire Jacques. This is said in good faith. I am not the\nking's physician, and his majesty has not given me the Garden of\nDaedalus in which to observe the constellations. Don't get angry, but\nlisten to me. What truth have you deduced, I will not say from medicine,\nwhich is too foolish a thing, but from astrology? Cite to me the virtues\nof the vertical boustrophedon, the treasures of the number ziruph and\nthose of the number zephirod!\"\n\n\"Will you deny,\" said Coictier, \"the sympathetic force of the collar\nbone, and the cabalistics which are derived from it?\"\n\n\"An error, Messire Jacques! None of your formulas end in reality.\nAlchemy on the other hand has its discoveries. Will you contest results\nlike this? Ice confined beneath the earth for a thousand years is\ntransformed into rock crystals. Lead is the ancestor of all metals. For\ngold is not a metal, gold is light. Lead requires only four periods of\ntwo hundred years each, to pass in succession from the state of lead, to\nthe state of red arsenic, from red arsenic to tin, from tin to silver.\nAre not these facts? But to believe in the collar bone, in the full line\nand in the stars, is as ridiculous as to believe with the inhabitants of\nGrand-Cathay that the golden oriole turns into a mole, and that grains\nof wheat turn into fish of the carp species.\"\n\n\"I have studied hermetic science!\" exclaimed Coictier, \"and I affirm--\"\n\nThe fiery archdeacon did not allow him to finish: \"And I have studied\nmedicine, astrology, and hermetics. Here alone is the truth.\" (As he\nspoke thus, he took from the top of the coffer a phial filled with the\npowder which we have mentioned above), \"here alone is light! Hippocrates\nis a dream; Urania is a dream; Hermes, a thought. Gold is the sun; to\nmake gold is to be God. Herein lies the one and only science. I have\nsounded the depths of medicine and astrology, I tell you! Naught,\nnothingness! The human body, shadows! the planets, shadows!\"\n\nAnd he fell back in his armchair in a commanding and inspired attitude.\nGossip Touraugeau watched him in silence. Coictier tried to grin,\nshrugged his shoulders imperceptibly, and repeated in a low voice,--\n\n\"A madman!\"\n\n\"And,\" said Tourangeau suddenly, \"the wondrous result,--have you\nattained it, have you made gold?\"\n\n\"If I had made it,\" replied the archdeacon, articulating his words\nslowly, like a man who is reflecting, \"the king of France would be named\nClaude and not Louis.\"\n\nThe stranger frowned.\n\n\"What am I saying?\" resumed Dom Claude, with a smile of disdain. \"What\nwould the throne of France be to me when I could rebuild the empire of\nthe Orient?\"\n\n\"Very good!\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Oh, the poor fool!\" murmured Coictier.\n\nThe archdeacon went on, appearing to reply now only to his thoughts,--\n\n\"But no, I am still crawling; I am scratching my face and knees against\nthe pebbles of the subterranean pathway. I catch a glimpse, I do not\ncontemplate! I do not read, I spell out!\"\n\n\"And when you know how to read!\" demanded the stranger, \"will you make\ngold?\"\n\n\"Who doubts it?\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"In that case Our Lady knows that I am greatly in need of money, and I\nshould much desire to read in your books. Tell me, reverend master, is\nyour science inimical or displeasing to Our Lady?\"\n\n\"Whose archdeacon I am?\" Dom Claude contented himself with replying,\nwith tranquil hauteur.\n\n\"That is true, my master. Well! will it please you to initiate me? Let\nme spell with you.\"\n\nClaude assumed the majestic and pontifical attitude of a Samuel.\n\n\"Old man, it requires longer years than remain to you, to undertake this\nvoyage across mysterious things. Your head is very gray! One comes forth\nfrom the cavern only with white hair, but only those with dark hair\nenter it. Science alone knows well how to hollow, wither, and dry up\nhuman faces; she needs not to have old age bring her faces already\nfurrowed. Nevertheless, if the desire possesses you of putting yourself\nunder discipline at your age, and of deciphering the formidable alphabet\nof the sages, come to me; 'tis well, I will make the effort. I will not\ntell you, poor old man, to go and visit the sepulchral chambers of the\npyramids, of which ancient Herodotus speaks, nor the brick tower of\nBabylon, nor the immense white marble sanctuary of the Indian temple of\nEklinga. I, no more than yourself, have seen the Chaldean masonry works\nconstructed according to the sacred form of the Sikra, nor the temple of\nSolomon, which is destroyed, nor the stone doors of the sepulchre of the\nkings of Israel, which are broken. We will content ourselves with the\nfragments of the book of Hermes which we have here. I will explain to\nyou the statue of Saint Christopher, the symbol of the sower, and that\nof the two angels which are on the front of the Sainte-Chapelle, and one\nof which holds in his hands a vase, the other, a cloud--\"\n\nHere Jacques Coictier, who had been unhorsed by the archdeacon's\nimpetuous replies, regained his saddle, and interrupted him with the\ntriumphant tone of one learned man correcting another,--\"_Erras amice\nClaudi_. The symbol is not the number. You take Orpheus for Hermes.\"\n\n\"'Tis you who are in error,\" replied the archdeacon, gravely. \"Daedalus\nis the base; Orpheus is the wall; Hermes is the edifice,--that is all.\nYou shall come when you will,\" he continued, turning to Tourangeau, \"I\nwill show you the little parcels of gold which remained at the bottom of\nNicholas Flamel's alembic, and you shall compare them with the gold of\nGuillaume de Paris. I will teach you the secret virtues of the Greek\nword, _peristera_. But, first of all, I will make you read, one after\nthe other, the marble letters of the alphabet, the granite pages of the\nbook. We shall go to the portal of Bishop Guillaume and of Saint-Jean le\nRond at the Sainte-Chapelle, then to the house of Nicholas Flamel, Rue\nManvault, to his tomb, which is at the Saints-Innocents, to his two\nhospitals, Rue de Montmorency. I will make you read the hieroglyphics\nwhich cover the four great iron cramps on the portal of the hospital\nSaint-Gervais, and of the Rue de la Ferronnerie. We will\nspell out in company, also, the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of Saint-Come, of\nSainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve-des-Ardents, of Saint Martin, of Saint-Jacques\nde la Boucherie--.\"\n\nFor a long time, Gossip Tourangeau, intelligent as was his glance, had\nappeared not to understand Dom Claude. He interrupted.\n\n\"_Pasque-dieu_! what are your books, then?\"\n\n\"Here is one of them,\" said the archdeacon.\n\nAnd opening the window of his cell he pointed out with his finger the\nimmense church of Notre-Dame, which, outlining against the starry sky\nthe black silhouette of its two towers, its stone flanks, its monstrous\nhaunches, seemed an enormous two-headed sphinx, seated in the middle of\nthe city.\n\nThe archdeacon gazed at the gigantic edifice for some time in silence,\nthen extending his right hand, with a sigh, towards the printed book\nwhich lay open on the table, and his left towards Notre-Dame, and\nturning a sad glance from the book to the church,--\"Alas,\" he said,\n\"this will kill that.\"\n\nCoictier, who had eagerly approached the book, could not repress an\nexclamation. \"H\u00c3\u00a9, but now, what is there so formidable in this: 'GLOSSA\nIN EPISTOLAS D. PAULI, _Norimbergoe, Antonius Koburger_, 1474.' This is\nnot new. 'Tis a book of Pierre Lombard, the Master of Sentences. Is it\nbecause it is printed?\"\n\n\"You have said it,\" replied Claude, who seemed absorbed in a profound\nmeditation, and stood resting, his forefinger bent backward on the folio\nwhich had come from the famous press of Nuremberg. Then he added these\nmysterious words: \"Alas! alas! small things come at the end of great\nthings; a tooth triumphs over a mass. The Nile rat kills the crocodile,\nthe swordfish kills the whale, the book will kill the edifice.\"\n\nThe curfew of the cloister sounded at the moment when Master Jacques\nwas repeating to his companion in low tones, his eternal refrain, \"He is\nmad!\" To which his companion this time replied, \"I believe that he is.\"\n\nIt was the hour when no stranger could remain in the cloister. The two\nvisitors withdrew. \"Master,\" said Gossip Tourangeau, as he took leave\nof the archdeacon, \"I love wise men and great minds, and I hold you\nin singular esteem. Come to-morrow to the Palace des Tournelles, and\ninquire for the Abb\u00c3\u00a9 de Sainte-Martin, of Tours.\"\n\nThe archdeacon returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending\nat last who Gossip Tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the\nregister of Sainte-Martin, of Tours:--_Abbas beati Martini, SCILICET REX\nFRANCIAE, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam\nhabet sanctus Venantius, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii_.\n\nIt is asserted that after that epoch the archdeacon had frequent\nconferences with Louis XI., when his majesty came to Paris, and that\nDom Claude's influence quite overshadowed that of Olivier le Daim and\nJacques Coictier, who, as was his habit, rudely took the king to task on\nthat account.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THIS WILL KILL THAT.\n\n\n\nOur lady readers will pardon us if we pause for a moment to seek what\ncould have been the thought concealed beneath those enigmatic words of\nthe archdeacon: \"This will kill that. The book will kill the edifice.\"\n\nTo our mind, this thought had two faces. In the first place, it was a\npriestly thought. It was the affright of the priest in the presence of\na new agent, the printing press. It was the terror and dazzled amazement\nof the men of the sanctuary, in the presence of the luminous press of\nGutenberg. It was the pulpit and the manuscript taking the alarm at the\nprinted word: something similar to the stupor of a sparrow which should\nbehold the angel Legion unfold his six million wings. It was the cry of\nthe prophet who already hears emancipated humanity roaring and\nswarming; who beholds in the future, intelligence sapping faith,\nopinion dethroning belief, the world shaking off Rome. It was the\nprognostication of the philosopher who sees human thought, volatilized\nby the press, evaporating from the theocratic recipient. It was the\nterror of the soldier who examines the brazen battering ram, and\nsays:--\"The tower will crumble.\" It signified that one power was about\nto succeed another power. It meant, \"The press will kill the church.\"\n\nBut underlying this thought, the first and most simple one, no doubt,\nthere was in our opinion another, newer one, a corollary of the first,\nless easy to perceive and more easy to contest, a view as philosophical\nand belonging no longer to the priest alone but to the savant and the\nartist. It was a presentiment that human thought, in changing its form,\nwas about to change its mode of expression; that the dominant idea of\neach generation would no longer be written with the same matter, and in\nthe same manner; that the book of stone, so solid and so durable, was\nabout to make way for the book of paper, more solid and still more\ndurable. In this connection the archdeacon's vague formula had a second\nsense. It meant, \"Printing will kill architecture.\"\n\nIn fact, from the origin of things down to the fifteenth century of the\nChristian era, inclusive, architecture is the great book of humanity,\nthe principal expression of man in his different stages of development,\neither as a force or as an intelligence.\n\nWhen the memory of the first races felt itself overloaded, when the mass\nof reminiscences of the human race became so heavy and so confused that\nspeech naked and flying, ran the risk of losing them on the way, men\ntranscribed them on the soil in a manner which was at once the most\nvisible, most durable, and most natural. They sealed each tradition\nbeneath a monument.\n\nThe first monuments were simple masses of rock, \"which the iron had not\ntouched,\" as Moses says. Architecture began like all writing. It was\nfirst an alphabet. Men planted a stone upright, it was a letter, and\neach letter was a hieroglyph, and upon each hieroglyph rested a group of\nideas, like the capital on the column. This is what the earliest races\ndid everywhere, at the same moment, on the surface of the entire world.\nWe find the \"standing stones\" of the Celts in Asian Siberia; in the\npampas of America.\n\nLater on, they made words; they placed stone upon stone, they coupled\nthose syllables of granite, and attempted some combinations. The Celtic\ndolmen and cromlech, the Etruscan tumulus, the Hebrew galgal, are words.\nSome, especially the tumulus, are proper names. Sometimes even, when men\nhad a great deal of stone, and a vast plain, they wrote a phrase. The\nimmense pile of Karnac is a complete sentence.\n\nAt last they made books. Traditions had brought forth symbols, beneath\nwhich they disappeared like the trunk of a tree beneath its foliage;\nall these symbols in which humanity placed faith continued to grow, to\nmultiply, to intersect, to become more and more complicated; the first\nmonuments no longer sufficed to contain them, they were overflowing\nin every part; these monuments hardly expressed now the primitive\ntradition, simple like themselves, naked and prone upon the earth. The\nsymbol felt the need of expansion in the edifice. Then architecture was\ndeveloped in proportion with human thought; it became a giant with\na thousand heads and a thousand arms, and fixed all this floating\nsymbolism in an eternal, visible, palpable form. While Daedalus, who is\nforce, measured; while Orpheus, who is intelligence, sang;--the pillar,\nwhich is a letter; the arcade, which is a syllable; the pyramid, which\nis a word,--all set in movement at once by a law of geometry and by a\nlaw of poetry, grouped themselves, combined, amalgamated, descended,\nascended, placed themselves side by side on the soil, ranged themselves\nin stories in the sky, until they had written under the dictation of\nthe general idea of an epoch, those marvellous books which were also\nmarvellous edifices: the Pagoda of Eklinga, the Rhamseion of Egypt, the\nTemple of Solomon.\n\nThe generating idea, the word, was not only at the foundation of\nall these edifices, but also in the form. The temple of Solomon, for\nexample, was not alone the binding of the holy book; it was the holy\nbook itself. On each one of its concentric walls, the priests could read\nthe word translated and manifested to the eye, and thus they followed\nits transformations from sanctuary to sanctuary, until they seized it in\nits last tabernacle, under its most concrete form, which still belonged\nto architecture: the arch. Thus the word was enclosed in an edifice, but\nits image was upon its envelope, like the human form on the coffin of a\nmummy.\n\nAnd not only the form of edifices, but the sites selected for them,\nrevealed the thought which they represented, according as the symbol to\nbe expressed was graceful or grave. Greece crowned her mountains with\na temple harmonious to the eye; India disembowelled hers, to chisel\ntherein those monstrous subterranean pagodas, borne up by gigantic rows\nof granite elephants.\n\nThus, during the first six thousand years of the world, from the\nmost immemorial pagoda of Hindustan, to the cathedral of Cologne,\narchitecture was the great handwriting of the human race. And this is so\ntrue, that not only every religious symbol, but every human thought, has\nits page and its monument in that immense book.\n\nAll civilization begins in theocracy and ends in democracy. This law of\nliberty following unity is written in architecture. For, let us insist\nupon this point, masonry must not be thought to be powerful only in\nerecting the temple and in expressing the myth and sacerdotal symbolism;\nin inscribing in hieroglyphs upon its pages of stone the mysterious\ntables of the law. If it were thus,--as there comes in all human society\na moment when the sacred symbol is worn out and becomes obliterated\nunder freedom of thought, when man escapes from the priest, when\nthe excrescence of philosophies and systems devour the face of\nreligion,--architecture could not reproduce this new state of human\nthought; its leaves, so crowded on the face, would be empty on the back;\nits work would be mutilated; its book would be incomplete. But no.\n\nLet us take as an example the Middle Ages, where we see more clearly\nbecause it is nearer to us. During its first period, while theocracy is\norganizing Europe, while the Vatican is rallying and reclassing about\nitself the elements of a Rome made from the Rome which lies in ruins\naround the Capitol, while Christianity is seeking all the stages of\nsociety amid the rubbish of anterior civilization, and rebuilding with\nits ruins a new hierarchic universe, the keystone to whose vault is the\npriest--one first hears a dull echo from that chaos, and then, little by\nlittle, one sees, arising from beneath the breath of Christianity, from\nbeneath the hand of the barbarians, from the fragments of the dead Greek\nand Roman architectures, that mysterious Romanesque architecture, sister\nof the theocratic masonry of Egypt and of India, inalterable emblem of\npure catholicism, unchangeable hieroglyph of the papal unity. All the\nthought of that day is written, in fact, in this sombre, Romanesque\nstyle. One feels everywhere in it authority, unity, the impenetrable,\nthe absolute, Gregory VII.; always the priest, never the man; everywhere\ncaste, never the people.\n\nBut the Crusades arrive. They are a great popular movement, and every\ngreat popular movement, whatever may be its cause and object, always\nsets free the spirit of liberty from its final precipitate. New\nthings spring into life every day. Here opens the stormy period of the\nJacqueries, Pragueries, and Leagues. Authority wavers, unity is divided.\nFeudalism demands to share with theocracy, while awaiting the inevitable\narrival of the people, who will assume the part of the lion: _Quia\nnominor leo_. Seignory pierces through sacerdotalism; the commonality,\nthrough seignory. The face of Europe is changed. Well! the face of\narchitecture is changed also. Like civilization, it has turned a\npage, and the new spirit of the time finds her ready to write at its\ndictation. It returns from the crusades with the pointed arch, like the\nnations with liberty.\n\nThen, while Rome is undergoing gradual dismemberment, Romanesque\narchitecture dies. The hieroglyph deserts the cathedral, and betakes\nitself to blazoning the donjon keep, in order to lend prestige to\nfeudalism. The cathedral itself, that edifice formerly so dogmatic,\ninvaded henceforth by the bourgeoisie, by the community, by liberty,\nescapes the priest and falls into the power of the artist. The artist\nbuilds it after his own fashion. Farewell to mystery, myth, law. Fancy\nand caprice, welcome. Provided the priest has his basilica and his\naltar, he has nothing to say. The four walls belong to the artist. The\narchitectural book belongs no longer to the priest, to religion, to\nRome; it is the property of poetry, of imagination, of the people. Hence\nthe rapid and innumerable transformations of that architecture which\nowns but three centuries, so striking after the stagnant immobility of\nthe Romanesque architecture, which owns six or seven. Nevertheless,\nart marches on with giant strides. Popular genius amid originality\naccomplish the task which the bishops formerly fulfilled. Each race\nwrites its line upon the book, as it passes; it erases the ancient\nRomanesque hieroglyphs on the frontispieces of cathedrals, and at the\nmost one only sees dogma cropping out here and there, beneath the new\nsymbol which it has deposited. The popular drapery hardly permits the\nreligious skeleton to be suspected. One cannot even form an idea of the\nliberties which the architects then take, even toward the Church. There\nare capitals knitted of nuns and monks, shamelessly coupled, as on the\nhall of chimney pieces in the Palais de Justice, in Paris. There is\nNoah's adventure carved to the last detail, as under the great portal\nof Bourges. There is a bacchanalian monk, with ass's ears and glass in\nhand, laughing in the face of a whole community, as on the lavatory\nof the Abbey of Bocherville. There exists at that epoch, for thought\nwritten in stone, a privilege exactly comparable to our present liberty\nof the press. It is the liberty of architecture.\n\nThis liberty goes very far. Sometimes a portal, a fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, an entire\nchurch, presents a symbolical sense absolutely foreign to worship, or\neven hostile to the Church. In the thirteenth century, Guillaume de\nParis, and Nicholas Flamel, in the fifteenth, wrote such seditious\npages. Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was a whole church of the\nopposition.\n\nThought was then free only in this manner; hence it never wrote itself\nout completely except on the books called edifices. Thought, under the\nform of edifice, could have beheld itself burned in the public square\nby the hands of the executioner, in its manuscript form, if it had been\nsufficiently imprudent to risk itself thus; thought, as the door of a\nchurch, would have been a spectator of the punishment of thought as a\nbook. Having thus only this resource, masonry, in order to make its way\nto the light, flung itself upon it from all quarters. Hence the immense\nquantity of cathedrals which have covered Europe--a number so prodigious\nthat one can hardly believe it even after having verified it. All\nthe material forces, all the intellectual forces of society converged\ntowards the same point: architecture. In this manner, under the pretext\nof building churches to God, art was developed in its magnificent\nproportions.\n\nThen whoever was born a poet became an architect. Genius, scattered in\nthe masses, repressed in every quarter under feudalism as under a\n_testudo_ of brazen bucklers, finding no issue except in the direction\nof architecture,--gushed forth through that art, and its Iliads assumed\nthe form of cathedrals. All other arts obeyed, and placed themselves\nunder the discipline of architecture. They were the workmen of the great\nwork. The architect, the poet, the master, summed up in his person the\nsculpture which carved his fa\u00c3\u00a7ades, painting which illuminated his\nwindows, music which set his bells to pealing, and breathed into his\norgans. There was nothing down to poor poetry,--properly speaking, that\nwhich persisted in vegetating in manuscripts,--which was not forced, in\norder to make something of itself, to come and frame itself in the\nedifice in the shape of a hymn or of prose; the same part, after all,\nwhich the tragedies of AEschylus had played in the sacerdotal festivals\nof Greece; Genesis, in the temple of Solomon.\n\nThus, down to the time of Gutenberg, architecture is the principal\nwriting, the universal writing. In that granite book, begun by the\nOrient, continued by Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages wrote\nthe last page. Moreover, this phenomenon of an architecture of the\npeople following an architecture of caste, which we have just been\nobserving in the Middle Ages, is reproduced with every analogous\nmovement in the human intelligence at the other great epochs of history.\nThus, in order to enunciate here only summarily, a law which it would\nrequire volumes to develop: in the high Orient, the cradle of primitive\ntimes, after Hindoo architecture came Phoenician architecture, that\nopulent mother of Arabian architecture; in antiquity, after Egyptian\narchitecture, of which Etruscan style and cyclopean monuments are but\none variety, came Greek architecture (of which the Roman style is only\na continuation), surcharged with the Carthaginian dome; in modern\ntimes, after Romanesque architecture came Gothic architecture. And by\nseparating there three series into their component parts, we shall find\nin the three eldest sisters, Hindoo architecture, Egyptian architecture,\nRomanesque architecture, the same symbol; that is to say, theocracy,\ncaste, unity, dogma, myth, God: and for the three younger sisters,\nPhoenician architecture, Greek architecture, Gothic architecture,\nwhatever, nevertheless, may be the diversity of form inherent in their\nnature, the same signification also; that is to say, liberty, the\npeople, man.\n\nIn the Hindu, Egyptian, or Romanesque architecture, one feels the\npriest, nothing but the priest, whether he calls himself Brahmin,\nMagian, or Pope. It is not the same in the architectures of the people.\nThey are richer and less sacred. In the Phoenician, one feels the\nmerchant; in the Greek, the republican; in the Gothic, the citizen.\n\nThe general characteristics of all theocratic architecture are\nimmutability, horror of progress, the preservation of traditional lines,\nthe consecration of the primitive types, the constant bending of all\nthe forms of men and of nature to the incomprehensible caprices of the\nsymbol. These are dark books, which the initiated alone understand how\nto decipher. Moreover, every form, every deformity even, has there\na sense which renders it inviolable. Do not ask of Hindoo, Egyptian,\nRomanesque masonry to reform their design, or to improve their\nstatuary. Every attempt at perfecting is an impiety to them. In these\narchitectures it seems as though the rigidity of the dogma had\nspread over the stone like a sort of second petrifaction. The general\ncharacteristics of popular masonry, on the contrary, are progress,\noriginality, opulence, perpetual movement. They are already sufficiently\ndetached from religion to think of their beauty, to take care of it, to\ncorrect without relaxation their parure of statues or arabesques. They\nare of the age. They have something human, which they mingle incessantly\nwith the divine symbol under which they still produce. Hence,\nedifices comprehensible to every soul, to every intelligence, to every\nimagination, symbolical still, but as easy to understand as nature.\nBetween theocratic architecture and this there is the difference\nthat lies between a sacred language and a vulgar language, between\nhieroglyphics and art, between Solomon and Phidias.\n\nIf the reader will sum up what we have hitherto briefly, very briefly,\nindicated, neglecting a thousand proofs and also a thousand objections\nof detail, he will be led to this: that architecture was, down to the\nfifteenth century, the chief register of humanity; that in that interval\nnot a thought which is in any degree complicated made its appearance in\nthe world, which has not been worked into an edifice; that every popular\nidea, and every religious law, has had its monumental records; that\nthe human race has, in short, had no important thought which it has not\nwritten in stone. And why? Because every thought, either philosophical\nor religious, is interested in perpetuating itself; because the idea\nwhich has moved one generation wishes to move others also, and leave a\ntrace. Now, what a precarious immortality is that of the manuscript! How\nmuch more solid, durable, unyielding, is a book of stone! In order to\ndestroy the written word, a torch and a Turk are sufficient. To demolish\nthe constructed word, a social revolution, a terrestrial revolution are\nrequired. The barbarians passed over the Coliseum; the deluge, perhaps,\npassed over the Pyramids.\n\nIn the fifteenth century everything changes.\n\nHuman thought discovers a mode of perpetuating itself, not only more\ndurable and more resisting than architecture, but still more simple and\neasy. Architecture is dethroned. Gutenberg's letters of lead are about\nto supersede Orpheus's letters of stone.\n\n   *The book is about to kill the edifice*.\n\nThe invention of printing is the greatest event in history. It is the\nmother of revolution. It is the mode of expression of humanity which is\ntotally renewed; it is human thought stripping off one form and donning\nanother; it is the complete and definitive change of skin of that\nsymbolical serpent which since the days of Adam has represented\nintelligence.\n\nIn its printed form, thought is more imperishable than ever; it is\nvolatile, irresistible, indestructible. It is mingled with the air. In\nthe days of architecture it made a mountain of itself, and took powerful\npossession of a century and a place. Now it converts itself into a flock\nof birds, scatters itself to the four winds, and occupies all points of\nair and space at once.\n\nWe repeat, who does not perceive that in this form it is far more\nindelible? It was solid, it has become alive. It passes from duration\nin time to immortality. One can demolish a mass; how can one extirpate\nubiquity? If a flood comes, the mountains will have long disappeared\nbeneath the waves, while the birds will still be flying about; and if a\nsingle ark floats on the surface of the cataclysm, they will alight upon\nit, will float with it, will be present with it at the ebbing of the\nwaters; and the new world which emerges from this chaos will behold, on\nits awakening, the thought of the world which has been submerged soaring\nabove it, winged and living.\n\nAnd when one observes that this mode of expression is not only the most\nconservative, but also the most simple, the most convenient, the most\npracticable for all; when one reflects that it does not drag after it\nbulky baggage, and does not set in motion a heavy apparatus; when one\ncompares thought forced, in order to transform itself into an edifice,\nto put in motion four or five other arts and tons of gold, a whole\nmountain of stones, a whole forest of timber-work, a whole nation of\nworkmen; when one compares it to the thought which becomes a book, and\nfor which a little paper, a little ink, and a pen suffice,--how can one\nbe surprised that human intelligence should have quitted architecture\nfor printing? Cut the primitive bed of a river abruptly with a canal\nhollowed out below its level, and the river will desert its bed.\n\nBehold how, beginning with the discovery of printing, architecture\nwithers away little by little, becomes lifeless and bare. How one feels\nthe water sinking, the sap departing, the thought of the times and of\nthe people withdrawing from it! The chill is almost imperceptible in\nthe fifteenth century; the press is, as yet, too weak, and, at the\nmost, draws from powerful architecture a superabundance of life.\nBut practically beginning with the sixteenth century, the malady of\narchitecture is visible; it is no longer the expression of society; it\nbecomes classic art in a miserable manner; from being Gallic, European,\nindigenous, it becomes Greek and Roman; from being true and modern,\nit becomes pseudo-classic. It is this decadence which is called the\nRenaissance. A magnificent decadence, however, for the ancient Gothic\ngenius, that sun which sets behind the gigantic press of Mayence, still\npenetrates for a while longer with its rays that whole hybrid pile of\nLatin arcades and Corinthian columns.\n\nIt is that setting sun which we mistake for the dawn.\n\nNevertheless, from the moment when architecture is no longer anything\nbut an art like any other; as soon as it is no longer the total art, the\nsovereign art, the tyrant art,--it has no longer the power to retain\nthe other arts. So they emancipate themselves, break the yoke of the\narchitect, and take themselves off, each one in its own direction. Each\none of them gains by this divorce. Isolation aggrandizes everything.\nSculpture becomes statuary, the image trade becomes painting, the canon\nbecomes music. One would pronounce it an empire dismembered at the death\nof its Alexander, and whose provinces become kingdoms.\n\nHence Raphael, Michael Angelo, Jean Goujon, Palestrina, those splendors\nof the dazzling sixteenth century.\n\nThought emancipates itself in all directions at the same time as the\narts. The arch-heretics of the Middle Ages had already made large\nincisions into Catholicism. The sixteenth century breaks religious\nunity. Before the invention of printing, reform would have been merely\na schism; printing converted it into a revolution. Take away the press;\nheresy is enervated. Whether it be Providence or Fate, Gutenburg is the\nprecursor of Luther.\n\nNevertheless, when the sun of the Middle Ages is completely set, when\nthe Gothic genius is forever extinct upon the horizon, architecture\ngrows dim, loses its color, becomes more and more effaced. The printed\nbook, the gnawing worm of the edifice, sucks and devours it. It becomes\nbare, denuded of its foliage, and grows visibly emaciated. It is petty,\nit is poor, it is nothing. It no longer expresses anything, not even the\nmemory of the art of another time. Reduced to itself, abandoned by the\nother arts, because human thought is abandoning it, it summons\nbunglers in place of artists. Glass replaces the painted windows. The\nstone-cutter succeeds the sculptor. Farewell all sap, all originality,\nall life, all intelligence. It drags along, a lamentable workshop\nmendicant, from copy to copy. Michael Angelo, who, no doubt, felt even\nin the sixteenth century that it was dying, had a last idea, an idea of\ndespair. That Titan of art piled the Pantheon on the Parthenon, and made\nSaint-Peter's at Rome. A great work, which deserved to remain unique,\nthe last originality of architecture, the signature of a giant artist at\nthe bottom of the colossal register of stone which was closed forever.\nWith Michael Angelo dead, what does this miserable architecture, which\nsurvived itself in the state of a spectre, do? It takes Saint-Peter\nin Rome, copies it and parodies it. It is a mania. It is a pity. Each\ncentury has its Saint-Peter's of Rome; in the seventeenth century, the\nVal-de-Gr\u00c3\u00a2ce; in the eighteenth, Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve. Each country has its\nSaint-Peter's of Rome. London has one; Petersburg has another; Paris has\ntwo or three. The insignificant testament, the last dotage of a decrepit\ngrand art falling back into infancy before it dies.\n\nIf, in place of the characteristic monuments which we have just\ndescribed, we examine the general aspect of art from the sixteenth\nto the eighteenth century, we notice the same phenomena of decay and\nphthisis. Beginning with Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois II., the architectural form of the\nedifice effaces itself more and more, and allows the geometrical form,\nlike the bony structure of an emaciated invalid, to become prominent.\nThe fine lines of art give way to the cold and inexorable lines of\ngeometry. An edifice is no longer an edifice; it is a polyhedron.\nMeanwhile, architecture is tormented in her struggles to conceal this\nnudity. Look at the Greek pediment inscribed upon the Roman pediment,\nand vice versa. It is still the Pantheon on the Parthenon: Saint-Peter's\nof Rome. Here are the brick houses of Henri IV., with their stone\ncorners; the Place Royale, the Place Dauphine. Here are the churches\nof Louis XIII., heavy, squat, thickset, crowded together, loaded with a\ndome like a hump. Here is the Mazarin architecture, the wretched Italian\npasticcio of the Four Nations. Here are the palaces of Louis XIV., long\nbarracks for courtiers, stiff, cold, tiresome. Here, finally, is Louis\nXV., with chiccory leaves and vermicelli, and all the warts, and all\nthe fungi, which disfigure that decrepit, toothless, and coquettish old\narchitecture. From Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois II. to Louis XV., the evil has increased in\ngeometrical progression. Art has no longer anything but skin upon its\nbones. It is miserably perishing.\n\nMeanwhile what becomes of printing? All the life which is leaving\narchitecture comes to it. In proportion as architecture ebbs, printing\nswells and grows. That capital of forces which human thought had been\nexpending in edifices, it henceforth expends in books. Thus, from the\nsixteenth century onward, the press, raised to the level of decaying\narchitecture, contends with it and kills it. In the seventeenth century\nit is already sufficiently the sovereign, sufficiently triumphant,\nsufficiently established in its victory, to give to the world the feast\nof a great literary century. In the eighteenth, having reposed for a\nlong time at the Court of Louis XIV., it seizes again the old sword of\nLuther, puts it into the hand of Voltaire, and rushes impetuously to\nthe attack of that ancient Europe, whose architectural expression it has\nalready killed. At the moment when the eighteenth century comes to\nan end, it has destroyed everything. In the nineteenth, it begins to\nreconstruct.\n\nNow, we ask, which of the three arts has really represented human\nthought for the last three centuries? which translates it? which\nexpresses not only its literary and scholastic vagaries, but its vast,\nprofound, universal movement? which constantly superposes itself,\nwithout a break, without a gap, upon the human race, which walks a\nmonster with a thousand legs?--Architecture or printing?\n\nIt is printing. Let the reader make no mistake; architecture is dead;\nirretrievably slain by the printed book,--slain because it endures for\na shorter time,--slain because it costs more. Every cathedral represents\nmillions. Let the reader now imagine what an investment of funds it\nwould require to rewrite the architectural book; to cause thousands of\nedifices to swarm once more upon the soil; to return to those epochs\nwhen the throng of monuments was such, according to the statement of an\neye witness, \"that one would have said that the world in shaking itself,\nhad cast off its old garments in order to cover itself with a white\nvesture of churches.\" _Erat enim ut si mundus, ipse excutiendo semet,\nrejecta vetustate, candida ecclesiarum vestem indueret_. (GLABER\nRADOLPHUS.)\n\nA book is so soon made, costs so little, and can go so far! How can it\nsurprise us that all human thought flows in this channel? This does not\nmean that architecture will not still have a fine monument, an isolated\nmasterpiece, here and there. We may still have from time to time, under\nthe reign of printing, a column made I suppose, by a whole army from\nmelted cannon, as we had under the reign of architecture, Iliads and\nRomanceros, Mahab\u00c3\u00a2hrata, and Nibelungen Lieds, made by a whole people,\nwith rhapsodies piled up and melted together. The great accident of an\narchitect of genius may happen in the twentieth century, like that of\nDante in the thirteenth. But architecture will no longer be the social\nart, the collective art, the dominating art. The grand poem, the grand\nedifice, the grand work of humanity will no longer be built: it will be\nprinted.\n\nAnd henceforth, if architecture should arise again accidentally, it will\nno longer be mistress. It will be subservient to the law of literature,\nwhich formerly received the law from it. The respective positions of the\ntwo arts will be inverted. It is certain that in architectural epochs,\nthe poems, rare it is true, resemble the monuments. In India, Vyasa is\nbranching, strange, impenetrable as a pagoda. In Egyptian Orient, poetry\nhas like the edifices, grandeur and tranquillity of line; in antique\nGreece, beauty, serenity, calm; in Christian Europe, the Catholic\nmajesty, the popular naivete, the rich and luxuriant vegetation of\nan epoch of renewal. The Bible resembles the Pyramids; the Iliad, the\nParthenon; Homer, Phidias. Dante in the thirteenth century is the\nlast Romanesque church; Shakespeare in the sixteenth, the last Gothic\ncathedral.\n\nThus, to sum up what we have hitherto said, in a fashion which is\nnecessarily incomplete and mutilated, the human race has two books, two\nregisters, two testaments: masonry and printing; the Bible of stone and\nthe Bible of paper. No doubt, when one contemplates these two Bibles,\nlaid so broadly open in the centuries, it is permissible to regret the\nvisible majesty of the writing of granite, those gigantic alphabets\nformulated in colonnades, in pylons, in obelisks, those sorts of human\nmountains which cover the world and the past, from the pyramid to the\nbell tower, from Cheops to Strasburg. The past must be reread upon these\npages of marble. This book, written by architecture, must be admired\nand perused incessantly; but the grandeur of the edifice which printing\nerects in its turn must not be denied.\n\nThat edifice is colossal. Some compiler of statistics has calculated,\nthat if all the volumes which have issued from the press since\nGutenberg's day were to be piled one upon another, they would fill\nthe space between the earth and the moon; but it is not that sort of\ngrandeur of which we wished to speak. Nevertheless, when one tries to\ncollect in one's mind a comprehensive image of the total products of\nprinting down to our own days, does not that total appear to us like an\nimmense construction, resting upon the entire world, at which humanity\ntoils without relaxation, and whose monstrous crest is lost in the\nprofound mists of the future? It is the anthill of intelligence. It is\nthe hive whither come all imaginations, those golden bees, with their\nhoney.\n\nThe edifice has a thousand stories. Here and there one beholds on its\nstaircases the gloomy caverns of science which pierce its interior.\nEverywhere upon its surface, art causes its arabesques, rosettes, and\nlaces to thrive luxuriantly before the eyes. There, every individual\nwork, however capricious and isolated it may seem, has its place and\nits projection. Harmony results from the whole. From the cathedral of\nShakespeare to the mosque of Byron, a thousand tiny bell towers are\npiled pell-mell above this metropolis of universal thought. At its base\nare written some ancient titles of humanity which architecture had\nnot registered. To the left of the entrance has been fixed the ancient\nbas-relief, in white marble, of Homer; to the right, the polyglot Bible\nrears its seven heads. The hydra of the Romancero and some other hybrid\nforms, the Vedas and the Nibelungen bristle further on.\n\nNevertheless, the prodigious edifice still remains incomplete. The\npress, that giant machine, which incessantly pumps all the intellectual\nsap of society, belches forth without pause fresh materials for its\nwork. The whole human race is on the scaffoldings. Each mind is a mason.\nThe humblest fills his hole, or places his stone. Retif d\u00c3\u00a8 le Bretonne\nbrings his hod of plaster. Every day a new course rises. Independently\nof the original and individual contribution of each writer, there are\ncollective contingents. The eighteenth century gives the _Encyclopedia_,\nthe revolution gives the _Moniteur_. Assuredly, it is a construction\nwhich increases and piles up in endless spirals; there also are\nconfusion of tongues, incessant activity, indefatigable labor, eager\ncompetition of all humanity, refuge promised to intelligence, a new\nFlood against an overflow of barbarians. It is the second tower of Babel\nof the human race.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK SIXTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. AN IMPARTIAL GLANCE AT THE ANCIENT MAGISTRACY.\n\n\n\nA very happy personage in the year of grace 1482, was the noble\ngentleman Robert d'Estouteville, chevalier, Sieur de Beyne, Baron d'Ivry\nand Saint Andry en la Marche, counsellor and chamberlain to the king,\nand guard of the provostship of Paris. It was already nearly seventeen\nyears since he had received from the king, on November 7, 1465, the\ncomet year,* that fine charge of the provostship of Paris, which was\nreputed rather a seigneury than an office. _Dignitas_, says Joannes\nLoemnoeus, _qu\u00c3\u00a6 cum non exigua potestate politiam concernente, atque\nproerogativis multis et juribus conjuncta est_. A marvellous thing in\n'82 was a gentleman bearing the king's commission, and whose letters\nof institution ran back to the epoch of the marriage of the natural\ndaughter of Louis XI. with Monsieur the Bastard of Bourbon.\n\n\n     *  This comet against which Pope Calixtus, uncle of Borgia,\nordered public prayers, is the same which reappeared in 1835.\n\n\nThe same day on which Robert d'Estouteville took the place of Jacques\nde Villiers in the provostship of Paris, Master Jehan Dauvet replaced\nMessire Helye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the Court of\nParliament, Jehan Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers\nin the office of chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans ousted\nPierre Puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the\nking's household. Now, upon how many heads had the presidency, the\nchancellorship, the mastership passed since Robert d'Estouteville\nhad held the provostship of Paris. It had been \"granted to him for\nsafekeeping,\" as the letters patent said; and certainly he kept it\nwell. He had clung to it, he had incorporated himself with it, he had\nso identified himself with it that he had escaped that fury for change\nwhich possessed Louis XI., a tormenting and industrious king, whose\npolicy it was to maintain the elasticity of his power by frequent\nappointments and revocations. More than this; the brave chevalier had\nobtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years\nalready, the name of the noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, equerry, had\nfigured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the\nprovostship of Paris. A rare and notable favor indeed! It is true that\nRobert d'Estouteville was a good soldier, that he had loyally raised his\npennon against \"the league of public good,\" and that he had presented\nto the queen a very marvellous stag in confectionery on the day of her\nentrance to Paris in 14... Moreover, he possessed the good friendship\nof Messire Tristan l'Hermite, provost of the marshals of the king's\nhousehold. Hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of Messire\nRobert. In the first place, very good wages, to which were attached, and\nfrom which hung, like extra bunches of grapes on his vine, the revenues\nof the civil and criminal registries of the provostship, plus the civil\nand criminal revenues of the tribunals of Embas of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, without\nreckoning some little toll from the bridges of Mantes and of Corbeil,\nand the profits on the craft of Shagreen-makers of Paris, on the corders\nof firewood and the measurers of salt. Add to this the pleasure of\ndisplaying himself in rides about the city, and of making his fine\nmilitary costume, which you may still admire sculptured on his tomb\nin the abbey of Valmont in Normandy, and his morion, all embossed at\nMontlh\u00c3\u00a9ry, stand out a contrast against the parti-colored red and tawny\nrobes of the aldermen and police. And then, was it nothing to wield\nabsolute supremacy over the sergeants of the police, the porter and\nwatch of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, the two auditors of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, _auditores\ncastelleti_, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen quarters, the\njailer of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, the four enfeoffed sergeants, the hundred and\ntwenty mounted sergeants, with maces, the chevalier of the watch with\nhis watch, his sub-watch, his counter-watch and his rear-watch? Was it\nnothing to exercise high and low justice, the right to interrogate,\nto hang and to draw, without reckoning petty jurisdiction in the first\nresort (_in prima instantia_, as the charters say), on that viscomty\nof Paris, so nobly appanaged with seven noble bailiwicks? Can anything\nsweeter be imagined than rendering judgments and decisions, as Messire\nRobert d'Estouteville daily did in the Grand Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, under the large\nand flattened arches of Philip Augustus? and going, as he was wont to\ndo every evening, to that charming house situated in the Rue Galilee, in\nthe enclosure of the royal palace, which he held in right of his wife,\nMadame Ambroise de Lore, to repose after the fatigue of having sent\nsome poor wretch to pass the night in \"that little cell of the Rue de\nEscorcherie, which the provosts and aldermen of Paris used to make their\nprison; the same being eleven feet long, seven feet and four inches\nwide, and eleven feet high?\"*\n\n\n     *  Comptes du domaine, 1383.\n\n\nAnd not only had Messire Robert d'Estouteville his special court as\nprovost and vicomte of Paris; but in addition he had a share, both for\neye and tooth, in the grand court of the king. There was no head in the\nleast elevated which had not passed through his hands before it came to\nthe headsman. It was he who went to seek M. de Nemours at the Bastille\nSaint Antoine, in order to conduct him to the Halles; and to conduct to\nthe Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve M. de Saint-Pol, who clamored and resisted, to the great joy\nof the provost, who did not love monsieur the constable.\n\nHere, assuredly, is more than sufficient to render a life happy and\nillustrious, and to deserve some day a notable page in that interesting\nhistory of the provosts of Paris, where one learns that Oudard de\nVilleneuve had a house in the Rue des Boucheries, that Guillaume\nde Hangest purchased the great and the little Savoy, that Guillaume\nThiboust gave the nuns of Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve his houses in the Rue Clopin,\nthat Hugues Aubriot lived in the H\u00c3\u00b4tel du Pore-Epic, and other domestic\nfacts.\n\nNevertheless, with so many reasons for taking life patiently and\njoyously, Messire Robert d'Estouteville woke up on the morning of the\nseventh of January, 1482, in a very surly and peevish mood. Whence came\nthis ill temper? He could not have told himself. Was it because the sky\nwas gray? or was the buckle of his old belt of Montlh\u00c3\u00a9ry badly fastened,\nso that it confined his provostal portliness too closely? had he beheld\nribald fellows, marching in bands of four, beneath his window, and\nsetting him at defiance, in doublets but no shirts, hats without crowns,\nwith wallet and bottle at their side? Was it a vague presentiment of the\nthree hundred and seventy livres, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which\nthe future King Charles VII. was to cut off from the provostship in the\nfollowing year? The reader can take his choice; we, for our part, are\nmuch inclined to believe that he was in a bad humor, simply because he\nwas in a bad humor.\n\nMoreover, it was the day after a festival, a tiresome day for every one,\nand above all for the magistrate who is charged with sweeping away all\nthe filth, properly and figuratively speaking, which a festival day\nproduces in Paris. And then he had to hold a sitting at the Grand\nCh\u00c3\u00a2telet. Now, we have noticed that judges in general so arrange matters\nthat their day of audience shall also be their day of bad humor, so that\nthey may always have some one upon whom to vent it conveniently, in the\nname of the king, law, and justice.\n\nHowever, the audience had begun without him. His lieutenants, civil,\ncriminal, and private, were doing his work, according to usage; and\nfrom eight o'clock in the morning, some scores of bourgeois and\n_bourgeoises_, heaped and crowded into an obscure corner of the audience\nchamber of Embas du Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, between a stout oaken barrier and the\nwall, had been gazing blissfully at the varied and cheerful spectacle of\ncivil and criminal justice dispensed by Master Florian Barbedienne,\nauditor of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, lieutenant of monsieur the provost, in a\nsomewhat confused and utterly haphazard manner.\n\nThe hall was small, low, vaulted. A table studded with fleurs-de-lis\nstood at one end, with a large arm-chair of carved oak, which belonged\nto the provost and was empty, and a stool on the left for the auditor,\nMaster Florian. Below sat the clerk of the court, scribbling; opposite\nwas the populace; and in front of the door, and in front of the table\nwere many sergeants of the provostship in sleeveless jackets of violet\ncamlet, with white crosses. Two sergeants of the Parloir-aux-Bourgeois,\nclothed in their jackets of Toussaint, half red, half blue, were\nposted as sentinels before a low, closed door, which was visible at\nthe extremity of the hall, behind the table. A single pointed window,\nnarrowly encased in the thick wall, illuminated with a pale ray of\nJanuary sun two grotesque figures,--the capricious demon of stone carved\nas a tail-piece in the keystone of the vaulted ceiling, and the judge\nseated at the end of the hall on the fleurs-de-lis.\n\nImagine, in fact, at the provost's table, leaning upon his elbows\nbetween two bundles of documents of cases, with his foot on the train\nof his robe of plain brown cloth, his face buried in his hood of white\nlamb's skin, of which his brows seemed to be of a piece, red, crabbed,\nwinking, bearing majestically the load of fat on his cheeks which met\nunder his chin, Master Florian Barbedienne, auditor of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet.\n\nNow, the auditor was deaf. A slight defect in an auditor. Master Florian\ndelivered judgment, none the less, without appeal and very suitably. It\nis certainly quite sufficient for a judge to have the air of listening;\nand the venerable auditor fulfilled this condition, the sole one in\njustice, all the better because his attention could not be distracted by\nany noise.\n\nMoreover, he had in the audience, a pitiless censor of his deeds and\ngestures, in the person of our friend Jehan Frollo du Moulin, that\nlittle student of yesterday, that \"stroller,\" whom one was sure of\nencountering all over Paris, anywhere except before the rostrums of the\nprofessors.\n\n\"Stay,\" he said in a low tone to his companion, Robin Poussepain, who\nwas grinning at his side, while he was making his comments on the scenes\nwhich were being unfolded before his eyes, \"yonder is Jehanneton\ndu Buisson. The beautiful daughter of the lazy dog at the\nMarch\u00c3\u00a9-Neuf!--Upon my soul, he is condemning her, the old rascal! he\nhas no more eyes than ears. Fifteen sous, four farthings, parisian, for\nhaving worn two rosaries! 'Tis somewhat dear. _Lex duri carminis_. Who's\nthat? Robin Chief-de-Ville, hauberkmaker. For having been passed and\nreceived master of the said trade! That's his entrance money. He! two\ngentlemen among these knaves! Aiglet de Soins, Hutin de Mailly Two\nequerries, _Corpus Christi_! Ah! they have been playing at dice. When\nshall I see our rector here? A hundred livres parisian, fine to the\nking! That Barbedienne strikes like a deaf man,--as he is! I'll be my\nbrother the archdeacon, if that keeps me from gaming; gaming by day,\ngaming by night, living at play, dying at play, and gaming away my soul\nafter my shirt. Holy Virgin, what damsels! One after the other my lambs.\nAmbroise L\u00c3\u00a9cuyere, Isabeau la Paynette, B\u00c3\u00a9rarde Gironin! I know them\nall, by Heavens! A fine! a fine! That's what will teach you to wear\ngilded girdles! ten sous parisis! you coquettes! Oh! the old snout of\na judge! deaf and imbecile! Oh! Florian the dolt! Oh! Barbedienne the\nblockhead! There he is at the table! He's eating the plaintiff, he's\neating the suits, he eats, he chews, he crams, he fills himself. Fines,\nlost goods, taxes, expenses, loyal charges, salaries, damages, and\ninterests, gehenna, prison, and jail, and fetters with expenses are\nChristmas spice cake and marchpanes of Saint-John to him! Look at\nhim, the pig!--Come! Good! Another amorous woman! Thibaud-la-Thibaude,\nneither more nor less! For having come from the Rue Glatigny! What\nfellow is this? Gieffroy Mabonne, gendarme bearing the crossbow. He\nhas cursed the name of the Father. A fine for la Thibaude! A fine for\nGieffroy! A fine for them both! The deaf old fool! he must have mixed up\nthe two cases! Ten to one that he makes the wench pay for the oath and\nthe gendarme for the amour! Attention, Robin Poussepain! What are\nthey going to bring in? Here are many sergeants! By Jupiter! all the\nbloodhounds of the pack are there. It must be the great beast of the\nhunt--a wild boar. And 'tis one, Robin, 'tis one. And a fine one too!\n_Hercle_! 'tis our prince of yesterday, our Pope of the Fools,\nour bellringer, our one-eyed man, our hunchback, our grimace! 'Tis\nQuasimodo!\"\n\nIt was he indeed.\n\nIt was Quasimodo, bound, encircled, roped, pinioned, and under good\nguard. The squad of policemen who surrounded him was assisted by the\nchevalier of the watch in person, wearing the arms of France embroidered\non his breast, and the arms of the city on his back. There was nothing,\nhowever, about Quasimodo, except his deformity, which could justify the\ndisplay of halberds and arquebuses; he was gloomy, silent, and tranquil.\nOnly now and then did his single eye cast a sly and wrathful glance upon\nthe bonds with which he was loaded.\n\nHe cast the same glance about him, but it was so dull and sleepy that\nthe women only pointed him out to each other in derision.\n\nMeanwhile Master Florian, the auditor, turned over attentively the\ndocument in the complaint entered against Quasimodo, which the clerk\nhanded him, and, having thus glanced at it, appeared to reflect for a\nmoment. Thanks to this precaution, which he always was careful to take\nat the moment when on the point of beginning an examination, he knew\nbeforehand the names, titles, and misdeeds of the accused, made cut\nand dried responses to questions foreseen, and succeeded in extricating\nhimself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his\ndeafness to be too apparent. The written charges were to him what the\ndog is to the blind man. If his deafness did happen to betray him\nhere and there, by some incoherent apostrophe or some unintelligible\nquestion, it passed for profundity with some, and for imbecility with\nothers. In neither case did the honor of the magistracy sustain any\ninjury; for it is far better that a judge should be reputed imbecile\nor profound than deaf. Hence he took great care to conceal his deafness\nfrom the eyes of all, and he generally succeeded so well that he had\nreached the point of deluding himself, which is, by the way, easier\nthan is supposed. All hunchbacks walk with their heads held high, all\nstutterers harangue, all deaf people speak low. As for him, he believed,\nat the most, that his ear was a little refractory. It was the sole\nconcession which he made on this point to public opinion, in his moments\nof frankness and examination of his conscience.\n\nHaving, then, thoroughly ruminated Quasimodo's affair, he threw back\nhis head and half closed his eyes, for the sake of more majesty and\nimpartiality, so that, at that moment, he was both deaf and blind. A\ndouble condition, without which no judge is perfect. It was in this\nmagisterial attitude that he began the examination.\n\n\"Your name?\"\n\nNow this was a case which had not been \"provided for by law,\" where a\ndeaf man should be obliged to question a deaf man.\n\nQuasimodo, whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to\nhim, continued to stare intently at the judge, and made no reply. The\njudge, being deaf, and being in no way warned of the deafness of the\naccused, thought that the latter had answered, as all accused do in\ngeneral, and therefore he pursued, with his mechanical and stupid\nself-possession,--\n\n\"Very well. And your age?\"\n\nAgain Quasimodo made no reply to this question. The judge supposed that\nit had been replied to, and continued,--\n\n\"Now, your profession?\"\n\nStill the same silence. The spectators had begun, meanwhile, to whisper\ntogether, and to exchange glances.\n\n\"That will do,\" went on the imperturbable auditor, when he supposed that\nthe accused had finished his third reply. \"You are accused before us,\n_primo_, of nocturnal disturbance; _secundo_, of a dishonorable act\nof violence upon the person of a foolish woman, _in proejudicium\nmeretricis; tertio_, of rebellion and disloyalty towards the archers\nof the police of our lord, the king. Explain yourself upon all these\npoints.---Clerk, have you written down what the prisoner has said thus\nfar?\"\n\nAt this unlucky question, a burst of laughter rose from the clerk's\ntable caught by the audience, so violent, so wild, so contagious, so\nuniversal, that the two deaf men were forced to perceive it. Quasimodo\nturned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while Master Florian,\nequally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators\nhad been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered\nvisible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, apostrophized him\nindignantly,--\n\n\"You have uttered a reply, knave, which deserves the halter. Do you know\nto whom you are speaking?\"\n\nThis sally was not fitted to arrest the explosion of general merriment.\nIt struck all as so whimsical, and so ridiculous, that the wild laughter\neven attacked the sergeants of the Parloi-aux-Bourgeois, a sort of\npikemen, whose stupidity was part of their uniform. Quasimodo alone\npreserved his seriousness, for the good reason that he understood\nnothing of what was going on around him. The judge, more and more\nirritated, thought it his duty to continue in the same tone, hoping\nthereby to strike the accused with a terror which should react upon the\naudience, and bring it back to respect.\n\n\"So this is as much as to say, perverse and thieving knave that you are,\nthat you permit yourself to be lacking in respect towards the Auditor\nof the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, to the magistrate committed to the popular police\nof Paris, charged with searching out crimes, delinquencies, and evil\nconduct; with controlling all trades, and interdicting monopoly; with\nmaintaining the pavements; with debarring the hucksters of chickens,\npoultry, and water-fowl; of superintending the measuring of fagots\nand other sorts of wood; of purging the city of mud, and the air of\ncontagious maladies; in a word, with attending continually to public\naffairs, without wages or hope of salary! Do you know that I am called\nFlorian Barbedienne, actual lieutenant to monsieur the provost, and,\nmoreover, commissioner, inquisitor, controller, and examiner, with equal\npower in provostship, bailiwick, preservation, and inferior court of\njudicature?--\"\n\nThere is no reason why a deaf man talking to a deaf man should stop.\nGod knows where and when Master Florian would have landed, when thus\nlaunched at full speed in lofty eloquence, if the low door at the\nextreme end of the room had not suddenly opened, and given entrance\nto the provost in person. At his entrance Master Florian did not stop\nshort, but, making a half-turn on his heels, and aiming at the provost\nthe harangue with which he had been withering Quasimodo a moment\nbefore,--\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said he, \"I demand such penalty as you shall deem fitting\nagainst the prisoner here present, for grave and aggravated offence\nagainst the court.\"\n\nAnd he seated himself, utterly breathless, wiping away the great\ndrops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched, like tears, the\nparchments spread out before him. Messire Robert d'Estouteville frowned\nand made a gesture so imperious and significant to Quasimodo, that the\ndeaf man in some measure understood it.\n\nThe provost addressed him with severity, \"What have you done that you\nhave been brought hither, knave?\"\n\nThe poor fellow, supposing that the provost was asking his name, broke\nthe silence which he habitually preserved, and replied, in a harsh and\nguttural voice, \"Quasimodo.\"\n\nThe reply matched the question so little that the wild laugh began to\ncirculate once more, and Messire Robert exclaimed, red with wrath,--\n\n\"Are you mocking me also, you arrant knave?\"\n\n\"Bellringer of Notre-Dame,\" replied Quasimodo, supposing that what was\nrequired of him was to explain to the judge who he was.\n\n\"Bellringer!\" interpolated the provost, who had waked up early enough to\nbe in a sufficiently bad temper, as we have said, not to require to have\nhis fury inflamed by such strange responses. \"Bellringer! I'll play you\na chime of rods on your back through the squares of Paris! Do you hear,\nknave?\"\n\n\"If it is my age that you wish to know,\" said Quasimodo, \"I think that I\nshall be twenty at Saint Martin's day.\"\n\nThis was too much; the provost could no longer restrain himself.\n\n\"Ah! you are scoffing at the provostship, wretch! Messieurs the\nsergeants of the mace, you will take me this knave to the pillory of the\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve, you will flog him, and turn him for an hour. He shall pay me for\nit, _t\u00c3\u00aate Dieu_! And I order that the present judgment shall be cried,\nwith the assistance of four sworn trumpeters, in the seven castellanies\nof the viscomty of Paris.\"\n\nThe clerk set to work incontinently to draw up the account of the\nsentence.\n\n\"_Ventre Dieu_! 'tis well adjudged!\" cried the little scholar, Jehan\nFrollo du Moulin, from his corner.\n\nThe provost turned and fixed his flashing eyes once more on Quasimodo.\n\"I believe the knave said '_Ventre Dieu_' Clerk, add twelve deniers\nParisian for the oath, and let the vestry of Saint Eustache have the\nhalf of it; I have a particular devotion for Saint Eustache.\"\n\nIn a few minutes the sentence was drawn up. Its tenor was simple and\nbrief. The customs of the provostship and the viscomty had not yet\nbeen worked over by President Thibaut Baillet, and by Roger Barmne, the\nking's advocate; they had not been obstructed, at that time, by that\nlofty hedge of quibbles and procedures, which the two jurisconsults\nplanted there at the beginning of the sixteenth century. All was clear,\nexpeditious, explicit. One went straight to the point then, and at the\nend of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and\nwithout turnings; the wheel, the gibbet, or the pillory. One at least\nknew whither one was going.\n\nThe clerk presented the sentence to the provost, who affixed his seal to\nit, and departed to pursue his round of the audience hall, in a frame\nof mind which seemed destined to fill all the jails in Paris that day.\nJehan Frollo and Robin Poussepain laughed in their sleeves. Quasimodo\ngazed on the whole with an indifferent and astonished air.\n\nHowever, at the moment when Master Florian Barbedienne was reading the\nsentence in his turn, before signing it, the clerk felt himself moved\nwith pity for the poor wretch of a prisoner, and, in the hope of\nobtaining some mitigation of the penalty, he approached as near the\nauditor's ear as possible, and said, pointing to Quasimodo, \"That man is\ndeaf.\"\n\nHe hoped that this community of infirmity would awaken Master Florian's\ninterest in behalf of the condemned man. But, in the first place, we\nhave already observed that Master Florian did not care to have his\ndeafness noticed. In the next place, he was so hard of hearing That he\ndid not catch a single word of what the clerk said to him; nevertheless,\nhe wished to have the appearance of hearing, and replied, \"Ah! ah! that\nis different; I did not know that. An hour more of the pillory, in that\ncase.\"\n\nAnd he signed the sentence thus modified.\n\n\"'Tis well done,\" said Robin Poussepain, who cherished a grudge against\nQuasimodo. \"That will teach him to handle people roughly.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE RAT-HOLE.\n\n\n\nThe reader must permit us to take him back to the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, which\nwe quitted yesterday with Gringoire, in order to follow la Esmeralda.\n\nIt is ten o'clock in the morning; everything is indicative of the day\nafter a festival. The pavement is covered with rubbish; ribbons, rags,\nfeathers from tufts of plumes, drops of wax from the torches, crumbs of\nthe public feast. A goodly number of bourgeois are \"sauntering,\" as we\nsay, here and there, turning over with their feet the extinct brands of\nthe bonfire, going into raptures in front of the Pillar House, over the\nmemory of the fine hangings of the day before, and to-day staring at the\nnails that secured them a last pleasure. The venders of cider and beer\nare rolling their barrels among the groups. Some busy passers-by\ncome and go. The merchants converse and call to each other from the\nthresholds of their shops. The festival, the ambassadors, Coppenole,\nthe Pope of the Fools, are in all mouths; they vie with each other, each\ntrying to criticise it best and laugh the most. And, meanwhile, four\nmounted sergeants, who have just posted themselves at the four sides\nof the pillory, have already concentrated around themselves a goodly\nproportion of the populace scattered on the Place, who condemn\nthemselves to immobility and fatigue in the hope of a small execution.\n\nIf the reader, after having contemplated this lively and noisy scene\nwhich is being enacted in all parts of the Place, will now transfer\nhis gaze towards that ancient demi-Gothic, demi-Romanesque house of the\nTour-Roland, which forms the corner on the quay to the west, he will\nobserve, at the angle of the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, a large public breviary, with rich\nilluminations, protected from the rain by a little penthouse, and from\nthieves by a small grating, which, however, permits of the leaves being\nturned. Beside this breviary is a narrow, arched window, closed by two\niron bars in the form of a cross, and looking on the square; the only\nopening which admits a small quantity of light and air to a little cell\nwithout a door, constructed on the ground-floor, in the thickness of the\nwalls of the old house, and filled with a peace all the more profound,\nwith a silence all the more gloomy, because a public place, the most\npopulous and most noisy in Paris swarms and shrieks around it.\n\nThis little cell had been celebrated in Paris for nearly three\ncenturies, ever since Madame Rolande de la Tour-Roland, in mourning for\nher father who died in the Crusades, had caused it to be hollowed out\nin the wall of her own house, in order to immure herself there forever,\nkeeping of all her palace only this lodging whose door was walled up,\nand whose window stood open, winter and summer, giving all the rest to\nthe poor and to God. The afflicted damsel had, in fact, waited twenty\nyears for death in this premature tomb, praying night and day for\nthe soul of her father, sleeping in ashes, without even a stone for a\npillow, clothed in a black sack, and subsisting on the bread and water\nwhich the compassion of the passers-by led them to deposit on the ledge\nof her window, thus receiving charity after having bestowed it. At her\ndeath, at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre, she\nhad bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women, mothers,\nwidows, or maidens, who should wish to pray much for others or for\nthemselves, and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great\ngrief or a great penance. The poor of her day had made her a fine\nfuneral, with tears and benedictions; but, to their great regret, the\npious maid had not been canonized, for lack of influence. Those among\nthem who were a little inclined to impiety, had hoped that the matter\nmight be accomplished in Paradise more easily than at Rome, and had\nfrankly besought God, instead of the pope, in behalf of the deceased.\nThe majority had contented themselves with holding the memory of Rolande\nsacred, and converting her rags into relics. The city, on its side, had\nfounded in honor of the damoiselle, a public breviary, which had been\nfastened near the window of the cell, in order that passers-by might\nhalt there from time to time, were it only to pray; that prayer might\nremind them of alms, and that the poor recluses, heiresses of Madame\nRolande's vault, might not die outright of hunger and forgetfulness.\n\nMoreover, this sort of tomb was not so very rare a thing in the cities\nof the Middle Ages. One often encountered in the most frequented street,\nin the most crowded and noisy market, in the very middle, under the feet\nof the horses, under the wheels of the carts, as it were, a cellar, a\nwell, a tiny walled and grated cabin, at the bottom of which a human\nbeing prayed night and day, voluntarily devoted to some eternal\nlamentation, to some great expiation. And all the reflections which that\nstrange spectacle would awaken in us to-day; that horrible cell, a sort\nof intermediary link between a house and the tomb, the cemetery and\nthe city; that living being cut off from the human community, and\nthenceforth reckoned among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop\nof oil in the darkness; that remnant of life flickering in the grave;\nthat breath, that voice, that eternal prayer in a box of stone;\nthat face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already\nilluminated with another sun; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb;\nthat soul a prisoner in that body; that body a prisoner in that dungeon\ncell, and beneath that double envelope of flesh and granite, the murmur\nof that soul in pain;--nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd.\nThe piety of that age, not very subtle nor much given to reasoning, did\nnot see so many facets in an act of religion. It took the thing in the\nblock, honored, venerated, hallowed the sacrifice at need, but did not\nanalyze the sufferings, and felt but moderate pity for them. It brought\nsome pittance to the miserable penitent from time to time, looked\nthrough the hole to see whether he were still living, forgot his name,\nhardly knew how many years ago he had begun to die, and to the stranger,\nwho questioned them about the living skeleton who was perishing in that\ncellar, the neighbors replied simply, \"It is the recluse.\"\n\nEverything was then viewed without metaphysics, without exaggeration,\nwithout magnifying glass, with the naked eye. The microscope had not yet\nbeen invented, either for things of matter or for things of the mind.\n\nMoreover, although people were but little surprised by it, the examples\nof this sort of cloistration in the hearts of cities were in truth\nfrequent, as we have just said. There were in Paris a considerable\nnumber of these cells, for praying to God and doing penance; they were\nnearly all occupied. It is true that the clergy did not like to have\nthem empty, since that implied lukewarmness in believers, and that\nlepers were put into them when there were no penitents on hand. Besides\nthe cell on the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, there was one at Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on, one at the Charnier\ndes Innocents, another I hardly know where,--at the Clichon House, I\nthink; others still at many spots where traces of them are found in\ntraditions, in default of memorials. The University had also its own. On\nMount Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve a sort of Job of the Middle Ages, for the space\nof thirty years, chanted the seven penitential psalms on a dunghill at\nthe bottom of a cistern, beginning anew when he had finished, singing\nloudest at night, _magna voce per umbras_, and to-day, the\nantiquary fancies that he hears his voice as he enters the Rue du\nPuits-qui-parle--the street of the \"Speaking Well.\"\n\nTo confine ourselves to the cell in the Tour-Roland, we must say that\nit had never lacked recluses. After the death of Madame Roland, it\nhad stood vacant for a year or two, though rarely. Many women had come\nthither to mourn, until their death, for relatives, lovers, faults.\nParisian malice, which thrusts its finger into everything, even into\nthings which concern it the least, affirmed that it had beheld but few\nwidows there.\n\nIn accordance with the fashion of the epoch, a Latin inscription on the\nwall indicated to the learned passer-by the pious purpose of this cell.\nThe custom was retained until the middle of the sixteenth century of\nexplaining an edifice by a brief device inscribed above the door.\nThus, one still reads in France, above the wicket of the prison in the\nseignorial mansion of Tourville, _Sileto et spera_; in Ireland, beneath\nthe armorial bearings which surmount the grand door to Fortescue Castle,\n_Forte scutum, salus ducum_; in England, over the principal entrance\nto the hospitable mansion of the Earls Cowper: _Tuum est_. At that time\nevery edifice was a thought.\n\nAs there was no door to the walled cell of the Tour-Roland, these two\nwords had been carved in large Roman capitals over the window,--\n\n\n   TU, ORA.\n\n\nAnd this caused the people, whose good sense does not perceive so much\nrefinement in things, and likes to translate _Ludovico Magno_ by \"Porte\nSaint-Denis,\" to give to this dark, gloomy, damp cavity, the name of\n\"The Rat-Hole.\" An explanation less sublime, perhaps, than the other;\nbut, on the other hand, more picturesque.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. HISTORY OF A LEAVENED CAKE OF MAIZE.\n\n\n\nAt the epoch of this history, the cell in the Tour-Roland was occupied.\nIf the reader desires to know by whom, he has only to lend an ear to the\nconversation of three worthy gossips, who, at the moment when we have\ndirected his attention to the Rat-Hole, were directing their steps\ntowards the same spot, coming up along the water's edge from the\nCh\u00c3\u00a2telet, towards the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\nTwo of these women were dressed like good _bourgeoises_ of Paris. Their\nfine white ruffs; their petticoats of linsey-woolsey, striped red and\nblue; their white knitted stockings, with clocks embroidered in colors,\nwell drawn upon their legs; the square-toed shoes of tawny leather with\nblack soles, and, above all, their headgear, that sort of tinsel horn,\nloaded down with ribbons and laces, which the women of Champagne still\nwear, in company with the grenadiers of the imperial guard of Russia,\nannounced that they belonged to that class wives which holds the middle\nground between what the lackeys call a woman and what they term a lady.\nThey wore neither rings nor gold crosses, and it was easy to see that,\nin their ease, this did not proceed from poverty, but simply from\nfear of being fined. Their companion was attired in very much the same\nmanner; but there was that indescribable something about her dress and\nbearing which suggested the wife of a provincial notary. One could see,\nby the way in which her girdle rose above her hips, that she had not\nbeen long in Paris.--Add to this a plaited tucker, knots of ribbon\non her shoes--and that the stripes of her petticoat ran horizontally\ninstead of vertically, and a thousand other enormities which shocked\ngood taste.\n\nThe two first walked with that step peculiar to Parisian ladies, showing\nParis to women from the country. The provincial held by the hand a big\nboy, who held in his a large, flat cake.\n\nWe regret to be obliged to add, that, owing to the rigor of the season,\nhe was using his tongue as a handkerchief.\n\nThe child was making them drag him along, _non passibus Cequis_, as\nVirgil says, and stumbling at every moment, to the great indignation of\nhis mother. It is true that he was looking at his cake more than at the\npavement. Some serious motive, no doubt, prevented his biting it (the\ncake), for he contented himself with gazing tenderly at it. But the\nmother should have rather taken charge of the cake. It was cruel to make\na Tantalus of the chubby-checked boy.\n\nMeanwhile, the three demoiselles (for the name of dames was then\nreserved for noble women) were all talking at once.\n\n\"Let us make haste, Demoiselle Mahiette,\" said the youngest of the\nthree, who was also the largest, to the provincial, \"I greatly fear that\nwe shall arrive too late; they told us at the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet that they were\ngoing to take him directly to the pillory.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! what are you saying, Demoiselle Oudarde Musnier?\" interposed\nthe other Parisienne. \"There are two hours yet to the pillory. We have\ntime enough. Have you ever seen any one pilloried, my dear Mahiette?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the provincial, \"at Reims.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! What is your pillory at Reims? A miserable cage into which\nonly peasants are turned. A great affair, truly!\"\n\n\"Only peasants!\" said Mahiette, \"at the cloth market in Reims! We have\nseen very fine criminals there, who have killed their father and mother!\nPeasants! For what do you take us, Gervaise?\"\n\nIt is certain that the provincial was on the point of taking offence,\nfor the honor of her pillory. Fortunately, that discreet damoiselle,\nOudarde Musnier, turned the conversation in time.\n\n\"By the way, Damoiselle Mahiette, what say you to our Flemish\nAmbassadors? Have you as fine ones at Reims?\"\n\n\"I admit,\" replied Mahiette, \"that it is only in Paris that such\nFlemings can be seen.\"\n\n\"Did you see among the embassy, that big ambassador who is a hosier?\"\nasked Oudarde.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mahiette. \"He has the eye of a Saturn.\"\n\n\"And the big fellow whose face resembles a bare belly?\" resumed\nGervaise. \"And the little one, with small eyes framed in red eyelids,\npared down and slashed up like a thistle head?\"\n\n\"'Tis their horses that are worth seeing,\" said Oudarde, \"caparisoned as\nthey are after the fashion of their country!\"\n\n\"Ah my dear,\" interrupted provincial Mahiette, assuming in her turn an\nair of superiority, \"what would you say then, if you had seen in '61, at\nthe consecration at Reims, eighteen years ago, the horses of the princes\nand of the king's company? Housings and caparisons of all sorts; some\nof damask cloth, of fine cloth of gold, furred with sables; others of\nvelvet, furred with ermine; others all embellished with goldsmith's work\nand large bells of gold and silver! And what money that had cost! And\nwhat handsome boy pages rode upon them!\"\n\n\"That,\" replied Oudarde dryly, \"does not prevent the Flemings having\nvery fine horses, and having had a superb supper yesterday with\nmonsieur, the provost of the merchants, at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville, where\nthey were served with comfits and hippocras, and spices, and other\nsingularities.\"\n\n\"What are you saying, neighbor!\" exclaimed Gervaise. \"It was with\nmonsieur the cardinal, at the Petit Bourbon that they supped.\"\n\n\"Not at all. At the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. At the Petit Bourbon!\"\n\n\"It was at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville,\" retorted Oudarde sharply, \"and Dr.\nScourable addressed them a harangue in Latin, which pleased them\ngreatly. My husband, who is sworn bookseller told me.\"\n\n\"It was at the Petit Bourbon,\" replied Gervaise, with no less spirit,\n\"and this is what monsieur the cardinal's procurator presented to them:\ntwelve double quarts of hippocras, white, claret, and red; twenty-four\nboxes of double Lyons marchpane, gilded; as many torches, worth two\nlivres a piece; and six demi-queues* of Beaune wine, white and claret,\nthe best that could be found. I have it from my husband, who is a\ncinquantenier**, at the Parloir-aux Bourgeois, and who was this morning\ncomparing the Flemish ambassadors with those of Prester John and the\nEmperor of Trebizond, who came from Mesopotamia to Paris, under the last\nking, and who wore rings in their ears.\"\n\n\n     *  A Queue was a cask which held a hogshead and a half.\n\n     **  A captain of fifty men.\n\n\n\"So true is it that they supped at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville,\" replied Oudarde\nbut little affected by this catalogue, \"that such a triumph of viands\nand comfits has never been seen.\"\n\n\"I tell you that they were served by Le Sec, sergeant of the city, at\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel du Petit-Bourbon, and that that is where you are mistaken.\"\n\n\"At the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville, I tell you!\"\n\n\"At the Petit-Bourbon, my dear! and they had illuminated with magic\nglasses the word hope, which is written on the grand portal.\"\n\n\"At the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville! At the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville! And Husson-le-Voir played\nthe flute!\"\n\n\"I tell you, no!\"\n\n\"I tell you, yes!\"\n\n\"I say, no!\"\n\nPlump and worthy Oudarde was preparing to retort, and the quarrel might,\nperhaps, have proceeded to a pulling of caps, had not Mahiette suddenly\nexclaimed,--\"Look at those people assembled yonder at the end of the\nbridge! There is something in their midst that they are looking at!\"\n\n\"In sooth,\" said Gervaise, \"I hear the sounds of a tambourine. I believe\n'tis the little Esmeralda, who plays her mummeries with her goat. Eh,\nbe quick, Mahiette! redouble your pace and drag along your boy. You\nare come hither to visit the curiosities of Paris. You saw the Flemings\nyesterday; you must see the gypsy to-day.\"\n\n\"The gypsy!\" said Mahiette, suddenly retracing her steps, and clasping\nher son's arm forcibly. \"God preserve me from it! She would steal my\nchild from me! Come, Eustache!\"\n\nAnd she set out on a run along the quay towards the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, until she had\nleft the bridge far behind her. In the meanwhile, the child whom she was\ndragging after her fell upon his knees; she halted breathless. Oudarde\nand Gervaise rejoined her.\n\n\"That gypsy steal your child from you!\" said Gervaise. \"That's a\nsingular freak of yours!\"\n\nMahiette shook her head with a pensive air.\n\n\"The singular point is,\" observed Oudarde, \"that _la sachette_ has the\nsame idea about the Egyptian woman.\"\n\n\"What is _la sachette_?\" asked Mahiette.\n\n\"H\u00c3\u00a9!\" said Oudarde, \"Sister Gudule.\"\n\n\"And who is Sister Gudule?\" persisted Mahiette.\n\n\"You are certainly ignorant of all but your Reims, not to know that!\"\nreplied Oudarde. \"'Tis the recluse of the Rat-Hole.\"\n\n\"What!\" demanded Mahiette, \"that poor woman to whom we are carrying this\ncake?\"\n\nOudarde nodded affirmatively.\n\n\"Precisely. You will see her presently at her window on the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. She\nhas the same opinion as yourself of these vagabonds of Egypt, who play\nthe tambourine and tell fortunes to the public. No one knows whence\ncomes her horror of the gypsies and Egyptians. But you, Mahiette--why do\nyou run so at the mere sight of them?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Mahiette, seizing her child's round head in both hands,\n\"I don't want that to happen to me which happened to Paquette la\nChantefleurie.\"\n\n\"Oh! you must tell us that story, my good Mahiette,\" said Gervaise,\ntaking her arm.\n\n\"Gladly,\" replied Mahiette, \"but you must be ignorant of all but your\nParis not to know that! I will tell you then (but 'tis not necessary for\nus to halt that I may tell you the tale), that Paquette la Chantefleurie\nwas a pretty maid of eighteen when I was one myself, that is to say,\neighteen years ago, and 'tis her own fault if she is not to-day, like\nme, a good, plump, fresh mother of six and thirty, with a husband and a\nson. However, after the age of fourteen, it was too late! Well, she was\nthe daughter of Guybertant, minstrel of the barges at Reims, the same\nwho had played before King Charles VII., at his coronation, when he\ndescended our river Vesle from Sillery to Muison, when Madame the Maid\nof Orleans was also in the boat. The old father died when Paquette was\nstill a mere child; she had then no one but her mother, the sister of\nM. Pradon, master-brazier and coppersmith in Paris, Rue Farm-Garlin, who\ndied last year. You see she was of good family. The mother was a good\nsimple woman, unfortunately, and she taught Paquette nothing but a bit\nof embroidery and toy-making which did not prevent the little one from\ngrowing very large and remaining very poor. They both dwelt at Reims,\non the river front, Rue de Folle-Peine. Mark this: For I believe it\nwas this which brought misfortune to Paquette. In '61, the year of the\ncoronation of our King Louis XI. whom God preserve! Paquette was so gay\nand so pretty that she was called everywhere by no other name than \"la\nChantefleurie\"--blossoming song. Poor girl! She had handsome teeth, she\nwas fond of laughing and displaying them. Now, a maid who loves to laugh\nis on the road to weeping; handsome teeth ruin handsome eyes. So she was\nla Chantefleurie. She and her mother earned a precarious living;\nthey had been very destitute since the death of the minstrel; their\nembroidery did not bring them in more than six farthings a week, which\ndoes not amount to quite two eagle liards. Where were the days\nwhen Father Guybertant had earned twelve sous parisian, in a single\ncoronation, with a song? One winter (it was in that same year of '61),\nwhen the two women had neither fagots nor firewood, it was very cold,\nwhich gave la Chantefleurie such a fine color that the men called\nher Paquette!* and many called her P\u00c3\u00a0querette!** and she was\nruined.--Eustache, just let me see you bite that cake if you dare!--We\nimmediately perceived that she was ruined, one Sunday when she came to\nchurch with a gold cross about her neck. At fourteen years of age! do\nyou see? First it was the young Vicomte de Cormontreuil, who has his\nbell tower three leagues distant from Reims; then Messire Henri\nde Triancourt, equerry to the King; then less than that, Chiart de\nBeaulion, sergeant-at-arms; then, still descending, Guery Aubergeon,\ncarver to the King; then, Mace de Fr\u00c3\u00a9pus, barber to monsieur the\ndauphin; then, Th\u00c3\u00a9venin le Moine, King's cook; then, the men growing\ncontinually younger and less noble, she fell to Guillaume Racine,\nminstrel of the hurdy gurdy and to Thierry de Mer, lamplighter. Then,\npoor Chantefleurie, she belonged to every one: she had reached the last\nsou of her gold piece. What shall I say to you, my damoiselles? At the\ncoronation, in the same year, '61, 'twas she who made the bed of the\nking of the debauchees! In the same year!\"\n\n\n     *  Ox-eye daisy.\n\n     **  Easter daisy.\n\n\nMahiette sighed, and wiped away a tear which trickled from her eyes.\n\n\"This is no very extraordinary history,\" said Gervaise, \"and in the\nwhole of it I see nothing of any Egyptian women or children.\"\n\n\"Patience!\" resumed Mahiette, \"you will see one child.--In '66, 'twill\nbe sixteen years ago this month, at Sainte-Paule's day, Paquette was\nbrought to bed of a little girl. The unhappy creature! it was a great\njoy to her; she had long wished for a child. Her mother, good woman, who\nhad never known what to do except to shut her eyes, her mother was dead.\nPaquette had no longer any one to love in the world or any one to love\nher. La Chantefleurie had been a poor creature during the five years\nsince her fall. She was alone, alone in this life, fingers were pointed\nat her, she was hooted at in the streets, beaten by the sergeants,\njeered at by the little boys in rags. And then, twenty had arrived: and\ntwenty is an old age for amorous women. Folly began to bring her in no\nmore than her trade of embroidery in former days; for every wrinkle that\ncame, a crown fled; winter became hard to her once more, wood became\nrare again in her brazier, and bread in her cupboard. She could no\nlonger work because, in becoming voluptuous, she had grown lazy; and she\nsuffered much more because, in growing lazy, she had become voluptuous.\nAt least, that is the way in which monsieur the cure of Saint-Remy\nexplains why these women are colder and hungrier than other poor women,\nwhen they are old.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" remarked Gervaise, \"but the gypsies?\"\n\n\"One moment, Gervaise!\" said Oudarde, whose attention was less\nimpatient. \"What would be left for the end if all were in the beginning?\nContinue, Mahiette, I entreat you. That poor Chantefleurie!\"\n\nMahiette went on.\n\n\"So she was very sad, very miserable, and furrowed her cheeks with\ntears. But in the midst of her shame, her folly, her debauchery,\nit seemed to her that she should be less wild, less shameful, less\ndissipated, if there were something or some one in the world whom she\ncould love, and who could love her. It was necessary that it should be a\nchild, because only a child could be sufficiently innocent for that. She\nhad recognized this fact after having tried to love a thief, the only\nman who wanted her; but after a short time, she perceived that the thief\ndespised her. Those women of love require either a lover or a child to\nfill their hearts. Otherwise, they are very unhappy. As she could not\nhave a lover, she turned wholly towards a desire for a child, and as she\nhad not ceased to be pious, she made her constant prayer to the good\nGod for it. So the good God took pity on her, and gave her a little\ndaughter. I will not speak to you of her joy; it was a fury of\ntears, and caresses, and kisses. She nursed her child herself, made\nswaddling-bands for it out of her coverlet, the only one which she\nhad on her bed, and no longer felt either cold or hunger. She became\nbeautiful once more, in consequence of it. An old maid makes a\nyoung mother. Gallantry claimed her once more; men came to see la\nChantefleurie; she found customers again for her merchandise, and out\nof all these horrors she made baby clothes, caps and bibs, bodices\nwith shoulder-straps of lace, and tiny bonnets of satin, without even\nthinking of buying herself another coverlet.--Master Eustache, I have\nalready told you not to eat that cake.--It is certain that little Agnes,\nthat was the child's name, a baptismal name, for it was a long time\nsince la Chantefleurie had had any surname--it is certain that\nthat little one was more swathed in ribbons and embroideries than a\ndauphiness of Dauphiny! Among other things, she had a pair of little\nshoes, the like of which King Louis XI. certainly never had! Her mother\nhad stitched and embroidered them herself; she had lavished on them all\nthe delicacies of her art of embroideress, and all the embellishments of\na robe for the good Virgin. They certainly were the two prettiest little\npink shoes that could be seen. They were no longer than my thumb, and\none had to see the child's little feet come out of them, in order to\nbelieve that they had been able to get into them. 'Tis true that those\nlittle feet were so small, so pretty, so rosy! rosier than the satin of\nthe shoes! When you have children, Oudarde, you will find that there is\nnothing prettier than those little hands and feet.\"\n\n\"I ask no better,\" said Oudarde with a sigh, \"but I am waiting until it\nshall suit the good pleasure of M. Andry Musnier.\"\n\n\"However, Paquette's child had more that was pretty about it besides its\nfeet. I saw her when she was only four months old; she was a love! She\nhad eyes larger than her mouth, and the most charming black hair, which\nalready curled. She would have been a magnificent brunette at the age\nof sixteen! Her mother became more crazy over her every day. She kissed\nher, caressed her, tickled her, washed her, decked her out, devoured\nher! She lost her head over her, she thanked God for her. Her pretty,\nlittle rosy feet above all were an endless source of wonderment, they\nwere a delirium of joy! She was always pressing her lips to them, and\nshe could never recover from her amazement at their smallness. She put\nthem into the tiny shoes, took them out, admired them, marvelled at\nthem, looked at the light through them, was curious to see them try to\nwalk on her bed, and would gladly have passed her life on her knees,\nputting on and taking off the shoes from those feet, as though they had\nbeen those of an Infant Jesus.\"\n\n\"The tale is fair and good,\" said Gervaise in a low tone; \"but where do\ngypsies come into all that?\"\n\n\"Here,\" replied Mahiette. \"One day there arrived in Reims a very queer\nsort of people. They were beggars and vagabonds who were roaming over\nthe country, led by their duke and their counts. They were browned by\nexposure to the sun, they had closely curling hair, and silver rings in\ntheir ears. The women were still uglier than the men. They had blacker\nfaces, which were always uncovered, a miserable frock on their bodies,\nan old cloth woven of cords bound upon their shoulder, and their hair\nhanging like the tail of a horse. The children who scrambled\nbetween their legs would have frightened as many monkeys. A band of\nexcommunicates. All these persons came direct from lower Egypt to\nReims through Poland. The Pope had confessed them, it was said, and had\nprescribed to them as penance to roam through the world for seven years,\nwithout sleeping in a bed; and so they were called penancers, and smelt\nhorribly. It appears that they had formerly been Saracens, which was\nwhy they believed in Jupiter, and claimed ten livres of Tournay from all\narchbishops, bishops, and mitred abbots with croziers. A bull from the\nPope empowered them to do that. They came to Reims to tell fortunes in\nthe name of the King of Algiers, and the Emperor of Germany. You can\nreadily imagine that no more was needed to cause the entrance to the\ntown to be forbidden them. Then the whole band camped with good grace\noutside the gate of Braine, on that hill where stands a mill, beside the\ncavities of the ancient chalk pits. And everybody in Reims vied with his\nneighbor in going to see them. They looked at your hand, and told you\nmarvellous prophecies; they were equal to predicting to Judas that he\nwould become Pope. Nevertheless, ugly rumors were in circulation in\nregard to them; about children stolen, purses cut, and human flesh\ndevoured. The wise people said to the foolish: \"Don't go there!\" and\nthen went themselves on the sly. It was an infatuation. The fact is,\nthat they said things fit to astonish a cardinal. Mothers triumphed\ngreatly over their little ones after the Egyptians had read in their\nhands all sorts of marvels written in pagan and in Turkish. One had an\nemperor; another, a pope; another, a captain. Poor Chantefleurie was\nseized with curiosity; she wished to know about herself, and whether\nher pretty little Agnes would not become some day Empress of Armenia,\nor something else. So she carried her to the Egyptians; and the Egyptian\nwomen fell to admiring the child, and to caressing it, and to kissing it\nwith their black mouths, and to marvelling over its little band, alas!\nto the great joy of the mother. They were especially enthusiastic over\nher pretty feet and shoes. The child was not yet a year old. She already\nlisped a little, laughed at her mother like a little mad thing, was\nplump and quite round, and possessed a thousand charming little gestures\nof the angels of paradise.\n\n\"She was very much frightened by the Egyptians, and wept. But her mother\nkissed her more warmly and went away enchanted with the good fortune\nwhich the soothsayers had foretold for her Agnes. She was to be a\nbeauty, virtuous, a queen. So she returned to her attic in the Rue\nFolle-Peine, very proud of bearing with her a queen. The next day she\ntook advantage of a moment when the child was asleep on her bed, (for\nthey always slept together), gently left the door a little way open, and\nran to tell a neighbor in the Rue de la S\u00c3\u00a9chesserie, that the day would\ncome when her daughter Agnes would be served at table by the King of\nEngland and the Archduke of Ethiopia, and a hundred other marvels. On\nher return, hearing no cries on the staircase, she said to herself:\n'Good! the child is still asleep!' She found her door wider open than\nshe had left it, but she entered, poor mother, and ran to the bed.---The\nchild was no longer there, the place was empty. Nothing remained of the\nchild, but one of her pretty little shoes. She flew out of the room,\ndashed down the stairs, and began to beat her head against the wall,\ncrying: 'My child! who has my child? Who has taken my child?' The street\nwas deserted, the house isolated; no one could tell her anything about\nit. She went about the town, searched all the streets, ran hither and\nthither the whole day long, wild, beside herself, terrible, snuffing at\ndoors and windows like a wild beast which has lost its young. She was\nbreathless, dishevelled, frightful to see, and there was a fire in her\neyes which dried her tears. She stopped the passers-by and cried: 'My\ndaughter! my daughter! my pretty little daughter! If any one will give\nme back my daughter, I will be his servant, the servant of his dog, and\nhe shall eat my heart if he will.' She met M. le Cur\u00c3\u00a9 of Saint-Remy, and\nsaid to him: 'Monsieur, I will till the earth with my finger-nails, but\ngive me back my child!' It was heartrending, Oudarde; and IL saw a very\nhard man, Master Ponce Lacabre, the procurator, weep. Ah! poor mother!\nIn the evening she returned home. During her absence, a neighbor had\nseen two gypsies ascend up to it with a bundle in their arms, then\ndescend again, after closing the door. After their departure, something\nlike the cries of a child were heard in Paquette's room. The mother,\nburst into shrieks of laughter, ascended the stairs as though on wings,\nand entered.--A frightful thing to tell, Oudarde! Instead of her pretty\nlittle Agnes, so rosy and so fresh, who was a gift of the good God, a\nsort of hideous little monster, lame, one-eyed, deformed, was crawling\nand squalling over the floor. She hid her eyes in horror. 'Oh!' said\nshe, 'have the witches transformed my daughter into this horrible\nanimal?' They hastened to carry away the little club-foot; he would have\ndriven her mad. It was the monstrous child of some gypsy woman, who had\ngiven herself to the devil. He appeared to be about four years old,\nand talked a language which was no human tongue; there were words in it\nwhich were impossible. La Chantefleurie flung herself upon the little\nshoe, all that remained to her of all that she loved. She remained so\nlong motionless over it, mute, and without breath, that they thought she\nwas dead. Suddenly she trembled all over, covered her relic with furious\nkisses, and burst out sobbing as though her heart were broken. I assure\nyou that we were all weeping also. She said: 'Oh, my little daughter! my\npretty little daughter! where art thou?'--and it wrung your very heart.\nI weep still when I think of it. Our children are the marrow of our\nbones, you see.---My poor Eustache! thou art so fair!--If you only knew\nhow nice he is! yesterday he said to me: 'I want to be a gendarme,\nthat I do.' Oh! my Eustache! if I were to lose thee!--All at once la\nChantefleurie rose, and set out to run through Reims, screaming: 'To the\ngypsies' camp! to the gypsies' camp! Police, to burn the witches!' The\ngypsies were gone. It was pitch dark. They could not be followed. On the\nmorrow, two leagues from Reims, on a heath between Gueux and Tilloy, the\nremains of a large fire were found, some ribbons which had belonged to\nPaquette's child, drops of blood, and the dung of a ram. The night\njust past had been a Saturday. There was no longer any doubt that\nthe Egyptians had held their Sabbath on that heath, and that they had\ndevoured the child in company with Beelzebub, as the practice is among\nthe Mahometans. When La Chantefleurie learned these horrible things, she\ndid not weep, she moved her lips as though to speak, but could not. On\nthe morrow, her hair was gray. On the second day, she had disappeared.\n\n\"'Tis in truth, a frightful tale,\" said Oudarde, \"and one which would\nmake even a Burgundian weep.\"\n\n\"I am no longer surprised,\" added Gervaise, \"that fear of the gypsies\nshould spur you on so sharply.\"\n\n\"And you did all the better,\" resumed Oudarde, \"to flee with your\nEustache just now, since these also are gypsies from Poland.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gervais, \"'tis said that they come from Spain and Catalonia.\"\n\n\"Catalonia? 'tis possible,\" replied Oudarde. \"Pologne, Catalogue,\nValogne, I always confound those three provinces, One thing is certain,\nthat they are gypsies.\"\n\n\"Who certainly,\" added Gervaise, \"have teeth long enough to eat little\nchildren. I should not be surprised if la Sm\u00c3\u00a9ralda ate a little of them\nalso, though she pretends to be dainty. Her white goat knows tricks that\nare too malicious for there not to be some impiety underneath it all.\"\n\nMahiette walked on in silence. She was absorbed in that revery which is,\nin some sort, the continuation of a mournful tale, and which ends only\nafter having communicated the emotion, from vibration to vibration, even\nto the very last fibres of the heart. Nevertheless, Gervaise addressed\nher, \"And did they ever learn what became of la Chantefleurie?\" Mahiette\nmade no reply. Gervaise repeated her question, and shook her arm,\ncalling her by name. Mahiette appeared to awaken from her thoughts.\n\n\"What became of la Chantefleurie?\" she said, repeating mechanically\nthe words whose impression was still fresh in her ear; then, ma king an\neffort to recall her attention to the meaning of her words, \"Ah!\" she\ncontinued briskly, \"no one ever found out.\"\n\nShe added, after a pause,--\n\n\"Some said that she had been seen to quit Reims at nightfall by the\nFl\u00c3\u00a9chembault gate; others, at daybreak, by the old Bas\u00c3\u00a9e gate. A poor\nman found her gold cross hanging on the stone cross in the field where\nthe fair is held. It was that ornament which had wrought her ruin, in\n'61. It was a gift from the handsome Vicomte de Cormontreuil, her first\nlover. Paquette had never been willing to part with it, wretched as she\nhad been. She had clung to it as to life itself. So, when we saw that\ncross abandoned, we all thought that she was dead. Nevertheless, there\nwere people of the Cabaret les Vantes, who said that they had seen her\npass along the road to Paris, walking on the pebbles with her bare feet.\nBut, in that case, she must have gone out through the Porte de Vesle,\nand all this does not agree. Or, to speak more truly, I believe that\nshe actually did depart by the Porte de Vesle, but departed from this\nworld.\"\n\n\"I do not understand you,\" said Gervaise.\n\n\"La Vesle,\" replied Mahiette, with a melancholy smile, \"is the river.\"\n\n\"Poor Chantefleurie!\" said Oudarde, with a shiver,--\"drowned!\"\n\n\"Drowned!\" resumed Mahiette, \"who could have told good Father\nGuybertant, when he passed under the bridge of Tingueux with the\ncurrent, singing in his barge, that one day his dear little Paquette\nwould also pass beneath that bridge, but without song or boat.\n\n\"And the little shoe?\" asked Gervaise.\n\n\"Disappeared with the mother,\" replied Mahiette.\n\n\"Poor little shoe!\" said Oudarde.\n\nOudarde, a big and tender woman, would have been well pleased to sigh in\ncompany with Mahiette. But Gervaise, more curious, had not finished her\nquestions.\n\n\"And the monster?\" she said suddenly, to Mahiette.\n\n\"What monster?\" inquired the latter.\n\n\"The little gypsy monster left by the sorceresses in Chantefleurie's\nchamber, in exchange for her daughter. What did you do with it? I hope\nyou drowned it also.\"\n\n\"No.\" replied Mahiette.\n\n\"What? You burned it then? In sooth, that is more just. A witch child!\"\n\n\"Neither the one nor the other, Gervaise. Monseigneur the archbishop\ninterested himself in the child of Egypt, exorcised it, blessed it,\nremoved the devil carefully from its body, and sent it to Paris, to be\nexposed on the wooden bed at Notre-Dame, as a foundling.\"\n\n\"Those bishops!\" grumbled Gervaise, \"because they are learned, they do\nnothing like anybody else. I just put it to you, Oudarde, the idea of\nplacing the devil among the foundlings! For that little monster was\nassuredly the devil. Well, Mahiette, what did they do with it in Paris?\nI am quite sure that no charitable person wanted it.\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied the R\u00c3\u00a9moise, \"'twas just at that time that my\nhusband bought the office of notary, at Bern, two leagues from the town,\nand we were no longer occupied with that story; besides, in front\nof Bern, stand the two hills of Cernay, which hide the towers of the\ncathedral in Reims from view.\"\n\nWhile chatting thus, the three worthy _bourgeoises_ had arrived at the\nPlace de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. In their absorption, they had passed the public breviary\nof the Tour-Roland without stopping, and took their way mechanically\ntowards the pillory around which the throng was growing more dense with\nevery moment. It is probable that the spectacle which at that moment\nattracted all looks in that direction, would have made them forget\ncompletely the Rat-Hole, and the halt which they intended to make there,\nif big Eustache, six years of age, whom Mahiette was dragging along by\nthe hand, had not abruptly recalled the object to them: \"Mother,\" said\nhe, as though some instinct warned him that the Rat-Hole was behind him,\n\"can I eat the cake now?\"\n\nIf Eustache had been more adroit, that is to say, less greedy, he\nwould have continued to wait, and would only have hazarded that simple\nquestion, \"Mother, can I eat the cake, now?\" on their return to the\nUniversity, to Master Andry Musnier's, Rue Madame la Valence, when he\nhad the two arms of the Seine and the five bridges of the city between\nthe Rat-Hole and the cake.\n\nThis question, highly imprudent at the moment when Eustache put it,\naroused Mahiette's attention.\n\n\"By the way,\" she exclaimed, \"we are forgetting the recluse! Show me the\nRat-Hole, that I may carry her her cake.\"\n\n\"Immediately,\" said Oudarde, \"'tis a charity.\"\n\nBut this did not suit Eustache.\n\n\"Stop! my cake!\" said he, rubbing both ears alternatively with his\nshoulders, which, in such cases, is the supreme sign of discontent.\n\nThe three women retraced their steps, and, on arriving in the vicinity\nof the Tour-Roland, Oudarde said to the other two,--\n\n\"We must not all three gaze into the hole at once, for fear of alarming\nthe recluse. Do you two pretend to read the _Dominus_ in the breviary,\nwhile I thrust my nose into the aperture; the recluse knows me a little.\nI will give you warning when you can approach.\"\n\nShe proceeded alone to the window. At the moment when she looked in,\na profound pity was depicted on all her features, and her frank, gay\nvisage altered its expression and color as abruptly as though it had\npassed from a ray of sunlight to a ray of moonlight; her eye became\nhumid; her mouth contracted, like that of a person on the point of\nweeping. A moment later, she laid her finger on her lips, and made a\nsign to Mahiette to draw near and look.\n\nMahiette, much touched, stepped up in silence, on tiptoe, as though\napproaching the bedside of a dying person.\n\nIt was, in fact, a melancholy spectacle which presented itself to\nthe eyes of the two women, as they gazed through the grating of the\nRat-Hole, neither stirring nor breathing.\n\nThe cell was small, broader than it was long, with an arched ceiling,\nand viewed from within, it bore a considerable resemblance to the\ninterior of a huge bishop's mitre. On the bare flagstones which formed\nthe floor, in one corner, a woman was sitting, or rather, crouching. Her\nchin rested on her knees, which her crossed arms pressed forcibly to\nher breast. Thus doubled up, clad in a brown sack, which enveloped\nher entirely in large folds, her long, gray hair pulled over in front,\nfalling over her face and along her legs nearly to her feet, she\npresented, at the first glance, only a strange form outlined against the\ndark background of the cell, a sort of dusky triangle, which the ray of\ndaylight falling through the opening, cut roughly into two shades, the\none sombre, the other illuminated. It was one of those spectres,\nhalf light, half shadow, such as one beholds in dreams and in the\nextraordinary work of Goya, pale, motionless, sinister, crouching over a\ntomb, or leaning against the grating of a prison cell.\n\nIt was neither a woman, nor a man, nor a living being, nor a definite\nform; it was a figure, a sort of vision, in which the real and the\nfantastic intersected each other, like darkness and day. It was with\ndifficulty that one distinguished, beneath her hair which spread to\nthe ground, a gaunt and severe profile; her dress barely allowed the\nextremity of a bare foot to escape, which contracted on the hard, cold\npavement. The little of human form of which one caught a sight beneath\nthis envelope of mourning, caused a shudder.\n\nThat figure, which one might have supposed to be riveted to the\nflagstones, appeared to possess neither movement, nor thought, nor\nbreath. Lying, in January, in that thin, linen sack, lying on a granite\nfloor, without fire, in the gloom of a cell whose oblique air-hole\nallowed only the cold breeze, but never the sun, to enter from without,\nshe did not appear to suffer or even to think. One would have said that\nshe had turned to stone with the cell, ice with the season. Her hands\nwere clasped, her eyes fixed. At first sight one took her for a spectre;\nat the second, for a statue.\n\nNevertheless, at intervals, her blue lips half opened to admit a breath,\nand trembled, but as dead and as mechanical as the leaves which the wind\nsweeps aside.\n\nNevertheless, from her dull eyes there escaped a look, an ineffable\nlook, a profound, lugubrious, imperturbable look, incessantly fixed upon\na corner of the cell which could not be seen from without; a gaze which\nseemed to fix all the sombre thoughts of that soul in distress upon some\nmysterious object.\n\nSuch was the creature who had received, from her habitation, the name of\nthe \"recluse\"; and, from her garment, the name of \"the sacked nun.\"\n\nThe three women, for Gervaise had rejoined Mahiette and Oudarde, gazed\nthrough the window. Their heads intercepted the feeble light in the\ncell, without the wretched being whom they thus deprived of it seeming\nto pay any attention to them. \"Do not let us trouble her,\" said Oudarde,\nin a low voice, \"she is in her ecstasy; she is praying.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mahiette was gazing with ever-increasing anxiety at that wan,\nwithered, dishevelled head, and her eyes filled with tears. \"This is\nvery singular,\" she murmured.\n\nShe thrust her head through the bars, and succeeded in casting a glance\nat the corner where the gaze of the unhappy woman was immovably riveted.\n\nWhen she withdrew her head from the window, her countenance was\ninundated with tears.\n\n\"What do you call that woman?\" she asked Oudarde.\n\nOudarde replied,--\n\n\"We call her Sister Gudule.\"\n\n\"And I,\" returned Mahiette, \"call her Paquette la Chantefleurie.\"\n\nThen, laying her finger on her lips, she motioned to the astounded\nOudarde to thrust her head through the window and look.\n\nOudarde looked and beheld, in the corner where the eyes of the\nrecluse were fixed in that sombre ecstasy, a tiny shoe of pink satin,\nembroidered with a thousand fanciful designs in gold and silver.\n\nGervaise looked after Oudarde, and then the three women, gazing upon the\nunhappy mother, began to weep.\n\nBut neither their looks nor their tears disturbed the recluse. Her hands\nremained clasped; her lips mute; her eyes fixed; and that little shoe,\nthus gazed at, broke the heart of any one who knew her history.\n\nThe three women had not yet uttered a single word; they dared not speak,\neven in a low voice. This deep silence, this deep grief, this profound\noblivion in which everything had disappeared except one thing, produced\nupon them the effect of the grand altar at Christmas or Easter. They\nremained silent, they meditated, they were ready to kneel. It seemed to\nthem that they were ready to enter a church on the day of Tenebrae.\n\nAt length Gervaise, the most curious of the three, and consequently the\nleast sensitive, tried to make the recluse speak:\n\n\"Sister! Sister Gudule!\"\n\nShe repeated this call three times, raising her voice each time. The\nrecluse did not move; not a word, not a glance, not a sigh, not a sign\nof life.\n\nOudarde, in her turn, in a sweeter, more caressing voice,--\"Sister!\"\nsaid she, \"Sister Sainte-Gudule!\"\n\nThe same silence; the same immobility.\n\n\"A singular woman!\" exclaimed Gervaise, \"and one not to be moved by a\ncatapult!\"\n\n\"Perchance she is deaf,\" said Oudarde.\n\n\"Perhaps she is blind,\" added Gervaise.\n\n\"Dead, perchance,\" returned Mahiette.\n\nIt is certain that if the soul had not already quitted this inert,\nsluggish, lethargic body, it had at least retreated and concealed itself\nin depths whither the perceptions of the exterior organs no longer\npenetrated.\n\n\"Then we must leave the cake on the window,\" said Oudarde; \"some scamp\nwill take it. What shall we do to rouse her?\"\n\nEustache, who, up to that moment had been diverted by a little carriage\ndrawn by a large dog, which had just passed, suddenly perceived that his\nthree conductresses were gazing at something through the window, and,\ncuriosity taking possession of him in his turn, he climbed upon a stone\npost, elevated himself on tiptoe, and applied his fat, red face to the\nopening, shouting, \"Mother, let me see too!\"\n\nAt the sound of this clear, fresh, ringing child's voice, the recluse\ntrembled; she turned her head with the sharp, abrupt movement of a steel\nspring, her long, fleshless hands cast aside the hair from her brow,\nand she fixed upon the child, bitter, astonished, desperate eyes. This\nglance was but a lightning flash.\n\n\"Oh my God!\" she suddenly exclaimed, hiding her head on her knees, and\nit seemed as though her hoarse voice tore her chest as it passed from\nit, \"do not show me those of others!\"\n\n\"Good day, madam,\" said the child, gravely.\n\nNevertheless, this shock had, so to speak, awakened the recluse. A long\nshiver traversed her frame from head to foot; her teeth chattered; she\nhalf raised her head and said, pressing her elbows against her hips, and\nclasping her feet in her hands as though to warm them,--\n\n\"Oh, how cold it is!\"\n\n\"Poor woman!\" said Oudarde, with great compassion, \"would you like a\nlittle fire?\"\n\nShe shook her head in token of refusal.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed Oudarde, presenting her with a flagon; \"here is some\nhippocras which will warm you; drink it.\"\n\nAgain she shook her head, looked at Oudarde fixedly and replied,\n\"Water.\"\n\nOudarde persisted,--\"No, sister, that is no beverage for January. You\nmust drink a little hippocras and eat this leavened cake of maize, which\nwe have baked for you.\"\n\nShe refused the cake which Mahiette offered to her, and said, \"Black\nbread.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Gervaise, seized in her turn with an impulse of charity,\nand unfastening her woolen cloak, \"here is a cloak which is a little\nwarmer than yours.\"\n\nShe refused the cloak as she had refused the flagon and the cake, and\nreplied, \"A sack.\"\n\n\"But,\" resumed the good Oudarde, \"you must have perceived to some\nextent, that yesterday was a festival.\"\n\n\"I do perceive it,\" said the recluse; \"'tis two days now since I have\nhad any water in my crock.\"\n\nShe added, after a silence, \"'Tis a festival, I am forgotten. People do\nwell. Why should the world think of me, when I do not think of it? Cold\ncharcoal makes cold ashes.\"\n\nAnd as though fatigued with having said so much, she dropped her head on\nher knees again. The simple and charitable Oudarde, who fancied that\nshe understood from her last words that she was complaining of the cold,\nreplied innocently, \"Then you would like a little fire?\"\n\n\"Fire!\" said the sacked nun, with a strange accent; \"and will you also\nmake a little for the poor little one who has been beneath the sod for\nthese fifteen years?\"\n\nEvery limb was trembling, her voice quivered, her eyes flashed, she had\nraised herself upon her knees; suddenly she extended her thin,\nwhite hand towards the child, who was regarding her with a look of\nastonishment. \"Take away that child!\" she cried. \"The Egyptian woman is\nabout to pass by.\"\n\nThen she fell face downward on the earth, and her forehead struck the\nstone, with the sound of one stone against another stone. The three\nwomen thought her dead. A moment later, however, she moved, and they\nbeheld her drag herself, on her knees and elbows, to the corner where\nthe little shoe was. Then they dared not look; they no longer saw her;\nbut they heard a thousand kisses and a thousand sighs, mingled with\nheartrending cries, and dull blows like those of a head in contact with\na wall. Then, after one of these blows, so violent that all three of\nthem staggered, they heard no more.\n\n\"Can she have killed herself?\" said Gervaise, venturing to pass her head\nthrough the air-hole. \"Sister! Sister Gudule!\"\n\n\"Sister Gudule!\" repeated Oudarde.\n\n\"Ah! good heavens! she no longer moves!\" resumed Gervaise; \"is she dead?\nGudule! Gudule!\"\n\nMahiette, choked to such a point that she could not speak, made an\neffort. \"Wait,\" said she. Then bending towards the window, \"Paquette!\"\nshe said, \"Paquette le Chantefleurie!\"\n\nA child who innocently blows upon the badly ignited fuse of a bomb, and\nmakes it explode in his face, is no more terrified than was Mahiette\nat the effect of that name, abruptly launched into the cell of Sister\nGudule.\n\nThe recluse trembled all over, rose erect on her bare feet, and leaped\nat the window with eyes so glaring that Mahiette and Oudarde, and the\nother woman and the child recoiled even to the parapet of the quay.\n\nMeanwhile, the sinister face of the recluse appeared pressed to the\ngrating of the air-hole. \"Oh! oh!\" she cried, with an appalling laugh;\n\"'tis the Egyptian who is calling me!\"\n\nAt that moment, a scene which was passing at the pillory caught her wild\neye. Her brow contracted with horror, she stretched her two skeleton\narms from her cell, and shrieked in a voice which resembled a\ndeath-rattle, \"So 'tis thou once more, daughter of Egypt! 'Tis thou\nwho callest me, stealer of children! Well! Be thou accursed! accursed!\naccursed! accursed!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. A TEAR FOR A DROP OF WATER.\n\n\n\nThese words were, so to speak, the point of union of two scenes, which\nhad, up to that time, been developed in parallel lines at the same\nmoment, each on its particular theatre; one, that which the reader has\njust perused, in the Rat-Hole; the other, which he is about to read, on\nthe ladder of the pillory. The first had for witnesses only the three\nwomen with whom the reader has just made acquaintance; the second had\nfor spectators all the public which we have seen above, collecting on\nthe Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, around the pillory and the gibbet.\n\nThat crowd which the four sergeants posted at nine o'clock in the\nmorning at the four corners of the pillory had inspired with the hope\nof some sort of an execution, no doubt, not a hanging, but a whipping,\na cropping of ears, something, in short,--that crowd had increased so\nrapidly that the four policemen, too closely besieged, had had occasion\nto \"press\" it, as the expression then ran, more than once, by sound\nblows of their whips, and the haunches of their horses.\n\nThis populace, disciplined to waiting for public executions, did not\nmanifest very much impatience. It amused itself with watching the\npillory, a very simple sort of monument, composed of a cube of masonry\nabout six feet high and hollow in the interior. A very steep staircase,\nof unhewn stone, which was called by distinction \"the ladder,\" led to\nthe upper platform, upon which was visible a horizontal wheel of solid\noak. The victim was bound upon this wheel, on his knees, with his hands\nbehind his back. A wooden shaft, which set in motion a capstan concealed\nin the interior of the little edifice, imparted a rotatory motion to\nthe wheel, which always maintained its horizontal position, and in this\nmanner presented the face of the condemned man to all quarters of the\nsquare in succession. This was what was called \"turning\" a criminal.\n\nAs the reader perceives, the pillory of the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve was far from\npresenting all the recreations of the pillory of the Halles. Nothing\narchitectural, nothing monumental. No roof to the iron cross, no\noctagonal lantern, no frail, slender columns spreading out on the edge\nof the roof into capitals of acanthus leaves and flowers, no waterspouts\nof chimeras and monsters, on carved woodwork, no fine sculpture, deeply\nsunk in the stone.\n\nThey were forced to content themselves with those four stretches of\nrubble work, backed with sandstone, and a wretched stone gibbet, meagre\nand bare, on one side.\n\nThe entertainment would have been but a poor one for lovers of Gothic\narchitecture. It is true that nothing was ever less curious on the score\nof architecture than the worthy gapers of the Middle Ages, and that they\ncared very little for the beauty of a pillory.\n\nThe victim finally arrived, bound to the tail of a cart, and when he had\nbeen hoisted upon the platform, where he could be seen from all points\nof the Place, bound with cords and straps upon the wheel of the pillory,\na prodigious hoot, mingled with laughter and acclamations, burst forth\nupon the Place. They had recognized Quasimodo.\n\nIt was he, in fact. The change was singular. Pilloried on the very place\nwhere, on the day before, he had been saluted, acclaimed, and proclaimed\nPope and Prince of Fools, in the cortege of the Duke of Egypt, the King\nof Thunes, and the Emperor of Galilee! One thing is certain, and that\nis, that there was not a soul in the crowd, not even himself, though in\nturn triumphant and the sufferer, who set forth this combination clearly\nin his thought. Gringoire and his philosophy were missing at this\nspectacle.\n\nSoon Michel Noiret, sworn trumpeter to the king, our lord, imposed\nsilence on the louts, and proclaimed the sentence, in accordance with\nthe order and command of monsieur the provost. Then he withdrew behind\nthe cart, with his men in livery surcoats.\n\nQuasimodo, impassible, did not wince. All resistance had been rendered\nimpossible to him by what was then called, in the style of the criminal\nchancellery, \"the vehemence and firmness of the bonds\" which means that\nthe thongs and chains probably cut into his flesh; moreover, it is a\ntradition of jail and wardens, which has not been lost, and which the\nhandcuffs still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle,\nhumane people (the galleys and the guillotine in parentheses).\n\nHe had allowed himself to be led, pushed, carried, lifted, bound,\nand bound again. Nothing was to be seen upon his countenance but the\nastonishment of a savage or an idiot. He was known to be deaf; one might\nhave pronounced him to be blind.\n\nThey placed him on his knees on the circular plank; he made no\nresistance. They removed his shirt and doublet as far as his girdle; he\nallowed them to have their way. They entangled him under a fresh system\nof thongs and buckles; he allowed them to bind and buckle him. Only from\ntime to time he snorted noisily, like a calf whose head is hanging and\nbumping over the edge of a butcher's cart.\n\n\"The dolt,\" said Jehan Frollo of the Mill, to his friend Robin\nPoussepain (for the two students had followed the culprit, as was to\nhave been expected), \"he understands no more than a cockchafer shut up\nin a box!\"\n\nThere was wild laughter among the crowd when they beheld Quasimodo's\nhump, his camel's breast, his callous and hairy shoulders laid bare.\nDuring this gayety, a man in the livery of the city, short of stature\nand robust of mien, mounted the platform and placed himself near the\nvictim. His name speedily circulated among the spectators. It was Master\nPierrat Torterue, official torturer to the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet.\n\nHe began by depositing on an angle of the pillory a black hour-glass,\nthe upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed\nto glide into the lower receptacle; then he removed his parti-colored\nsurtout, and there became visible, suspended from his right hand, a\nthin and tapering whip of long, white, shining, knotted, plaited thongs,\narmed with metal nails. With his left hand, he negligently folded back\nhis shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit.\n\nIn the meantime, Jehan Frollo, elevating his curly blonde head above\nthe crowd (he had mounted upon the shoulders of Robin Poussepain for the\npurpose), shouted: \"Come and look, gentle ladies and men! they are\ngoing to peremptorily flagellate Master Quasimodo, the bellringer of\nmy brother, monsieur the archdeacon of Josas, a knave of oriental\narchitecture, who has a back like a dome, and legs like twisted\ncolumns!\"\n\nAnd the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.\n\nAt length the torturer stamped his foot. The wheel began to turn.\nQuasimodo wavered beneath his bonds. The amazement which was suddenly\ndepicted upon his deformed face caused the bursts of laughter to\nredouble around him.\n\nAll at once, at the moment when the wheel in its revolution presented to\nMaster Pierrat, the humped back of Quasimodo, Master Pierrat raised his\narm; the fine thongs whistled sharply through the air, like a handful of\nadders, and fell with fury upon the wretch's shoulders.\n\nQuasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start. He began to\nunderstand. He writhed in his bonds; a violent contraction of surprise\nand pain distorted the muscles of his face, but he uttered not a single\nsigh. He merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the\nleft, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a\ngadfly.\n\nA second blow followed the first, then a third, and another and another,\nand still others. The wheel did not cease to turn, nor the blows to rain\ndown.\n\nSoon the blood burst forth, and could be seen trickling in a thousand\nthreads down the hunchback's black shoulders; and the slender thongs, in\ntheir rotatory motion which rent the air, sprinkled drops of it upon the\ncrowd.\n\nQuasimodo had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability. He\nhad at first tried, in a quiet way and without much outward movement,\nto break his bonds. His eye had been seen to light up, his muscles\nto stiffen, his members to concentrate their force, and the straps\nto stretch. The effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the\nprovost's seasoned bonds resisted. They cracked, and that was all.\nQuasimodo fell back exhausted. Amazement gave way, on his features, to\na sentiment of profound and bitter discouragement. He closed his single\neye, allowed his head to droop upon his breast, and feigned death.\n\nFrom that moment forth, he stirred no more. Nothing could force a\nmovement from him. Neither his blood, which did not cease to flow, nor\nthe blows which redoubled in fury, nor the wrath of the torturer, who\ngrew excited himself and intoxicated with the execution, nor the sound\nof the horrible thongs, more sharp and whistling than the claws of\nscorpions.\n\nAt length a bailiff from the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet clad in black, mounted on a black\nhorse, who had been stationed beside the ladder since the beginning\nof the execution, extended his ebony wand towards the hour-glass. The\ntorturer stopped. The wheel stopped. Quasimodo's eye opened slowly.\n\nThe scourging was finished. Two lackeys of the official torturer bathed\nthe bleeding shoulders of the patient, anointed them with some unguent\nwhich immediately closed all the wounds, and threw upon his back a sort\nof yellow vestment, in cut like a chasuble. In the meanwhile, Pierrat\nTorterue allowed the thongs, red and gorged with blood, to drip upon the\npavement.\n\nAll was not over for Quasimodo. He had still to undergo that hour of\npillory which Master Florian Barbedienne had so judiciously added to the\nsentence of Messire Robert d'Estouteville; all to the greater glory\nof the old physiological and psychological play upon words of Jean de\nCum\u00c3\u00a8ne, _Surdus absurdus_: a deaf man is absurd.\n\nSo the hour-glass was turned over once more, and they left the hunchback\nfastened to the plank, in order that justice might be accomplished to\nthe very end.\n\nThe populace, especially in the Middle Ages, is in society what the\nchild is in the family. As long as it remains in its state of primitive\nignorance, of moral and intellectual minority, it can be said of it as\nof the child,--\n\n\n   'Tis the pitiless age.\n\n\nWe have already shown that Quasimodo was generally hated, for more than\none good reason, it is true. There was hardly a spectator in that crowd\nwho had not or who did not believe that he had reason to complain of the\nmalevolent hunchback of Notre-Dame. The joy at seeing him appear thus\nin the pillory had been universal; and the harsh punishment which he had\njust suffered, and the pitiful condition in which it had left him, far\nfrom softening the populace had rendered its hatred more malicious by\narming it with a touch of mirth.\n\nHence, the \"public prosecution\" satisfied, as the bigwigs of the law\nstill express it in their jargon, the turn came of a thousand private\nvengeances. Here, as in the Grand Hall, the women rendered themselves\nparticularly prominent. All cherished some rancor against him, some for\nhis malice, others for his ugliness. The latter were the most furious.\n\n\"Oh! mask of Antichrist!\" said one.\n\n\"Rider on a broom handle!\" cried another.\n\n\"What a fine tragic grimace,\" howled a third, \"and who would make him\nPope of the Fools if to-day were yesterday?\"\n\n\"'Tis well,\" struck in an old woman. \"This is the grimace of the\npillory. When shall we have that of the gibbet?\"\n\n\"When will you be coiffed with your big bell a hundred feet under\nground, cursed bellringer?\"\n\n\"But 'tis the devil who rings the Angelus!\"\n\n\"Oh! the deaf man! the one-eyed creature! the hunch-back! the monster!\"\n\n\"A face to make a woman miscarry better than all the drugs and\nmedicines!\"\n\nAnd the two scholars, Jehan du Moulin, and Robin Poussepain, sang at the\ntop of their lungs, the ancient refrain,--\n\n\n   \"_Une hart\n   Pour le pendard!\n   Un fagot\n   Pour le magot_!\"*\n\n\n     *  A rope for the gallows bird!  A fagot for the ape.\n\n\nA thousand other insults rained down upon him, and hoots and\nimprecations, and laughter, and now and then, stones.\n\nQuasimodo was deaf but his sight was clear, and the public fury was\nno less energetically depicted on their visages than in their words.\nMoreover, the blows from the stones explained the bursts of laughter.\n\nAt first he held his ground. But little by little that patience which\nhad borne up under the lash of the torturer, yielded and gave way before\nall these stings of insects. The bull of the Asturias who has been but\nlittle moved by the attacks of the picador grows irritated with the dogs\nand banderilleras.\n\nHe first cast around a slow glance of hatred upon the crowd. But bound\nas he was, his glance was powerless to drive away those flies which\nwere stinging his wound. Then he moved in his bonds, and his furious\nexertions made the ancient wheel of the pillory shriek on its axle. All\nthis only increased the derision and hooting.\n\nThen the wretched man, unable to break his collar, like that of a\nchained wild beast, became tranquil once more; only at intervals a sigh\nof rage heaved the hollows of his chest. There was neither shame nor\nredness on his face. He was too far from the state of society, and too\nnear the state of nature to know what shame was. Moreover, with such\na degree of deformity, is infamy a thing that can be felt? But wrath,\nhatred, despair, slowly lowered over that hideous visage a cloud\nwhich grew ever more and more sombre, ever more and more charged with\nelectricity, which burst forth in a thousand lightning flashes from the\neye of the cyclops.\n\nNevertheless, that cloud cleared away for a moment, at the passage of\na mule which traversed the crowd, bearing a priest. As far away as\nhe could see that mule and that priest, the poor victim's visage grew\ngentler. The fury which had contracted it was followed by a strange\nsmile full of ineffable sweetness, gentleness, and tenderness. In\nproportion as the priest approached, that smile became more clear, more\ndistinct, more radiant. It was like the arrival of a Saviour, which the\nunhappy man was greeting. But as soon as the mule was near enough to the\npillory to allow of its rider recognizing the victim, the priest dropped\nhis eyes, beat a hasty retreat, spurred on rigorously, as though in\nhaste to rid himself of humiliating appeals, and not at all desirous of\nbeing saluted and recognized by a poor fellow in such a predicament.\n\nThis priest was Archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo.\n\nThe cloud descended more blackly than ever upon Quasimodo's brow. The\nsmile was still mingled with it for a time, but was bitter, discouraged,\nprofoundly sad.\n\nTime passed on. He had been there at least an hour and a half,\nlacerated, maltreated, mocked incessantly, and almost stoned.\n\nAll at once he moved again in his chains with redoubled despair, which\nmade the whole framework that bore him tremble, and, breaking the\nsilence which he had obstinately preserved hitherto, he cried in a\nhoarse and furious voice, which resembled a bark rather than a human\ncry, and which was drowned in the noise of the hoots--\"Drink!\"\n\nThis exclamation of distress, far from exciting compassion, only added\namusement to the good Parisian populace who surrounded the ladder, and\nwho, it must be confessed, taken in the mass and as a multitude, was\nthen no less cruel and brutal than that horrible tribe of robbers among\nwhom we have already conducted the reader, and which was simply the\nlower stratum of the populace. Not a voice was raised around the unhappy\nvictim, except to jeer at his thirst. It is certain that at that moment\nhe was more grotesque and repulsive than pitiable, with his face purple\nand dripping, his eye wild, his mouth foaming with rage and pain, and\nhis tongue lolling half out. It must also be stated that if a charitable\nsoul of a bourgeois or _bourgeoise_, in the rabble, had attempted to\ncarry a glass of water to that wretched creature in torment, there\nreigned around the infamous steps of the pillory such a prejudice of\nshame and ignominy, that it would have sufficed to repulse the good\nSamaritan.\n\nAt the expiration of a few moments, Quasimodo cast a desperate glance\nupon the crowd, and repeated in a voice still more heartrending:\n\"Drink!\"\n\nAnd all began to laugh.\n\n\"Drink this!\" cried Robin Poussepain, throwing in his face a sponge\nwhich had been soaked in the gutter. \"There, you deaf villain, I'm your\ndebtor.\"\n\nA woman hurled a stone at his head,--\n\n\"That will teach you to wake us up at night with your peal of a dammed\nsoul.\"\n\n\"He, good, my son!\" howled a cripple, making an effort to reach him with\nhis crutch, \"will you cast any more spells on us from the top of the\ntowers of Notre-Dame?\"\n\n\"Here's a drinking cup!\" chimed in a man, flinging a broken jug at his\nbreast. \"'Twas you that made my wife, simply because she passed near\nyou, give birth to a child with two heads!\"\n\n\"And my cat bring forth a kitten with six paws!\" yelped an old crone,\nlaunching a brick at him.\n\n\"Drink!\" repeated Quasimodo panting, and for the third time.\n\nAt that moment he beheld the crowd give way. A young girl, fantastically\ndressed, emerged from the throng. She was accompanied by a little white\ngoat with gilded horns, and carried a tambourine in her hand.\n\nQuasimodo's eyes sparkled. It was the gypsy whom he had attempted to\ncarry off on the preceding night, a misdeed for which he was dimly\nconscious that he was being punished at that very moment; which was\nnot in the least the case, since he was being chastised only for the\nmisfortune of being deaf, and of having been judged by a deaf man. He\ndoubted not that she had come to wreak her vengeance also, and to deal\nher blow like the rest.\n\nHe beheld her, in fact, mount the ladder rapidly. Wrath and spite\nsuffocate him. He would have liked to make the pillory crumble into\nruins, and if the lightning of his eye could have dealt death, the gypsy\nwould have been reduced to powder before she reached the platform.\n\nShe approached, without uttering a syllable, the victim who writhed in\na vain effort to escape her, and detaching a gourd from her girdle, she\nraised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man.\n\nThen, from that eye which had been, up to that moment, so dry and\nburning, a big tear was seen to fall, and roll slowly down that deformed\nvisage so long contracted with despair. It was the first, in all\nprobability, that the unfortunate man had ever shed.\n\nMeanwhile, he had forgotten to drink. The gypsy made her little pout,\nfrom impatience, and pressed the spout to the tusked month of Quasimodo,\nwith a smile.\n\nHe drank with deep draughts. His thirst was burning.\n\nWhen he had finished, the wretch protruded his black lips, no doubt,\nwith the object of kissing the beautiful hand which had just succoured\nhim. But the young girl, who was, perhaps, somewhat distrustful, and who\nremembered the violent attempt of the night, withdrew her hand with the\nfrightened gesture of a child who is afraid of being bitten by a beast.\n\nThen the poor deaf man fixed on her a look full of reproach and\ninexpressible sadness.\n\nIt would have been a touching spectacle anywhere,--this beautiful,\nfresh, pure, and charming girl, who was at the same time so weak, thus\nhastening to the relief of so much misery, deformity, and malevolence.\nOn the pillory, the spectacle was sublime.\n\nThe very populace were captivated by it, and began to clap their hands,\ncrying,--\n\n\"Noel! Noel!\"\n\nIt was at that moment that the recluse caught sight, from the window of\nher bole, of the gypsy on the pillory, and hurled at her her sinister\nimprecation,--\n\n\"Accursed be thou, daughter of Egypt! Accursed! accursed!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. END OF THE STORY OF THE CAKE.\n\n\n\nLa Esmeralda turned pale and descended from the pillory, staggering as\nshe went. The voice of the recluse still pursued her,--\n\n\"Descend! descend! Thief of Egypt! thou shalt ascend it once more!\"\n\n\"The sacked nun is in one of her tantrums,\" muttered the populace;\nand that was the end of it. For that sort of woman was feared; which\nrendered them sacred. People did not then willingly attack one who\nprayed day and night.\n\nThe hour had arrived for removing Quasimodo. He was unbound, the crowd\ndispersed.\n\nNear the Grand Pont, Mahiette, who was returning with her two\ncompanions, suddenly halted,--\n\n\"By the way, Eustache! what did you do with that cake?\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said the child, \"while you were talking with that lady in the\nbole, a big dog took a bite of my cake, and then I bit it also.\"\n\n\"What, sir, did you eat the whole of it?\" she went on.\n\n\"Mother, it was the dog. I told him, but he would not listen to me. Then\nI bit into it, also.\"\n\n\"'Tis a terrible child!\" said the mother, smiling and scolding at one\nand the same time. \"Do you see, Oudarde? He already eats all the fruit\nfrom the cherry-tree in our orchard of Charlerange. So his grandfather\nsays that he will be a captain. Just let me catch you at it again,\nMaster Eustache. Come along, you greedy fellow!\"\n\n                       End of Volume 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVENTH. I. The Danger of Confiding One's Secret to a Goat II.

THE DANGER OF CONFIDING ONE'S SECRET TO A GOAT.\n\n\n\nMany weeks had elapsed.\n\nThe first of March had arrived. The sun, which Dubartas, that classic\nancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the \"Grand-duke of Candles,\"\nwas none the less radiant and joyous on that account. It was one of\nthose spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all\nParis turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them\nas though they were Sundays. In those days of brilliancy, warmth, and\nserenity, there is a certain hour above all others, when the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of\nNotre-Dame should be admired. It is the moment when the sun, already\ndeclining towards the west, looks the cathedral almost full in the face.\nIts rays, growing more and more horizontal, withdraw slowly from the\npavement of the square, and mount up the perpendicular fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, whose\nthousand bosses in high relief they cause to start out from the shadows,\nwhile the great central rose window flames like the eye of a cyclops,\ninflamed with the reflections of the forge.\n\nThis was the hour.\n\nOpposite the lofty cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone\nbalcony built above the porch of a rich Gothic house, which formed the\nangle of the square and the Rue du Parvis, several young girls were\nlaughing and chatting with every sort of grace and mirth. From the\nlength of the veil which fell from their pointed coif, twined with\npearls, to their heels, from the fineness of the embroidered chemisette\nwhich covered their shoulders and allowed a glimpse, according to the\npleasing custom of the time, of the swell of their fair virgin bosoms,\nfrom the opulence of their under-petticoats still more precious than\ntheir overdress (marvellous refinement), from the gauze, the silk,\nthe velvet, with which all this was composed, and, above all, from the\nwhiteness of their hands, which certified to their leisure and idleness,\nit was easy to divine they were noble and wealthy heiresses. They were,\nin fact, Damoiselle Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier and her companions,\nDiane de Christeuil, Amelotte de Montmichel, Colombe de Gaillefontaine,\nand the little de Champchevrier maiden; all damsels of good birth,\nassembled at that moment at the house of the dame widow de Gondelaurier,\non account of Monseigneur de Beaujeu and Madame his wife, who were to\ncome to Paris in the month of April, there to choose maids of honor for\nthe Dauphiness Marguerite, who was to be received in Picardy from the\nhands of the Flemings. Now, all the squires for twenty leagues around\nwere intriguing for this favor for their daughters, and a goodly number\nof the latter had been already brought or sent to Paris. These four\nmaidens had been confided to the discreet and venerable charge of\nMadame Aloise de Gondelaurier, widow of a former commander of the king's\ncross-bowmen, who had retired with her only daughter to her house in the\nPlace du Parvis, Notre-Dame, in Paris.\n\nThe balcony on which these young girls stood opened from a chamber\nrichly tapestried in fawn-colored Flanders leather, stamped with golden\nfoliage. The beams, which cut the ceiling in parallel lines, diverted\nthe eye with a thousand eccentric painted and gilded carvings. Splendid\nenamels gleamed here and there on carved chests; a boar's head in\nfaience crowned a magnificent dresser, whose two shelves announced that\nthe mistress of the house was the wife or widow of a knight banneret. At\nthe end of the room, by the side of a lofty chimney blazoned with\narms from top to bottom, in a rich red velvet arm-chair, sat Dame de\nGondelaurier, whose five and fifty years were written upon her garments\nno less distinctly than upon her face.\n\nBeside her stood a young man of imposing mien, although partaking\nsomewhat of vanity and bravado--one of those handsome fellows whom all\nwomen agree to admire, although grave men learned in physiognomy shrug\ntheir shoulders at them. This young man wore the garb of a captain of\nthe king's unattached archers, which bears far too much resemblance to\nthe costume of Jupiter, which the reader has already been enabled to\nadmire in the first book of this history, for us to inflict upon him a\nsecond description.\n\nThe damoiselles were seated, a part in the chamber, a part in the\nbalcony, some on square cushions of Utrecht velvet with golden corners,\nothers on stools of oak carved in flowers and figures. Each of them held\non her knee a section of a great needlework tapestry, on which they\nwere working in company, while one end of it lay upon the rush mat which\ncovered the floor.\n\nThey were chatting together in that whispering tone and with the\nhalf-stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose\nmidst there is a young man. The young man whose presence served to set\nin play all these feminine self-conceits, appeared to pay very little\nheed to the matter, and, while these pretty damsels were vying with one\nanother to attract his attention, he seemed to be chiefly absorbed in\npolishing the buckle of his sword belt with his doeskin glove. From time\nto time, the old lady addressed him in a very low tone, and he\nreplied as well as he was able, with a sort of awkward and constrained\npoliteness.\n\nFrom the smiles and significant gestures of Dame Aloise, from the\nglances which she threw towards her daughter, Fleur-de-Lys, as she spoke\nlow to the captain, it was easy to see that there was here a question of\nsome betrothal concluded, some marriage near at hand no doubt, between\nthe young man and Fleur-de-Lys. From the embarrassed coldness of the\nofficer, it was easy to see that on his side, at least, love had\nno longer any part in the matter. His whole air was expressive of\nconstraint and weariness, which our lieutenants of the garrison would\nto-day translate admirably as, \"What a beastly bore!\"\n\nThe poor dame, very much infatuated with her daughter, like any other\nsilly mother, did not perceive the officer's lack of enthusiasm, and\nstrove in low tones to call his attention to the infinite grace with\nwhich Fleur-de-Lys used her needle or wound her skein.\n\n\"Come, little cousin,\" she said to him, plucking him by the sleeve, in\norder to speak in his ear, \"Look at her, do! see her stoop.\"\n\n\"Yes, truly,\" replied the young man, and fell back into his glacial and\nabsent-minded silence.\n\nA moment later, he was obliged to bend down again, and Dame Aloise said\nto him,--\n\n\"Have you ever beheld a more gay and charming face than that of your\nbetrothed? Can one be more white and blonde? are not her hands perfect?\nand that neck--does it not assume all the curves of the swan in\nravishing fashion? How I envy you at times! and how happy you are to be\na man, naughty libertine that you are! Is not my Fleur-de-Lys adorably\nbeautiful, and are you not desperately in love with her?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he replied, still thinking of something else.\n\n\"But do say something,\" said Madame Aloise, suddenly giving his shoulder\na push; \"you have grown very timid.\"\n\nWe can assure our readers that timidity was neither the captain's virtue\nnor his defect. But he made an effort to do what was demanded of him.\n\n\"Fair cousin,\" he said, approaching Fleur-de-Lys, \"what is the subject\nof this tapestry work which you are fashioning?\" \"Fair cousin,\"\nresponded Fleur-de-Lys, in an offended tone, \"I have already told you\nthree times. 'Tis the grotto of Neptune.\"\n\nIt was evident that Fleur-de-Lys saw much more clearly than her mother\nthrough the captain's cold and absent-minded manner. He felt the\nnecessity of making some conversation.\n\n\"And for whom is this Neptunerie destined?\"\n\n\"For the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs,\" answered Fleur-de-Lys,\nwithout raising her eyes.\n\nThe captain took up a corner of the tapestry.\n\n\"Who, my fair cousin, is this big gendarme, who is puffing out his\ncheeks to their full extent and blowing a trumpet?\"\n\n\"'Tis Triton,\" she replied.\n\nThere was a rather pettish intonation in Fleur-de-Lys's--laconic words.\nThe young man understood that it was indispensable that he should\nwhisper something in her ear, a commonplace, a gallant compliment, no\nmatter what. Accordingly he bent down, but he could find nothing in his\nimagination more tender and personal than this,--\n\n\"Why does your mother always wear that surcoat with armorial designs,\nlike our grandmothers of the time of Charles VII.? Tell her, fair\ncousin, that 'tis no longer the fashion, and that the hinge (gond)\nand the laurel (laurier) embroidered on her robe give her the air of\na walking mantlepiece. In truth, people no longer sit thus on their\nbanners, I assure you.\"\n\nFleur-de-Lys raised her beautiful eyes, full of reproach, \"Is that all\nof which you can assure me?\" she said, in a low voice.\n\nIn the meantime, Dame Aloise, delighted to see them thus bending towards\neach other and whispering, said as she toyed with the clasps of her\nprayer-book,--\n\n\"Touching picture of love!\"\n\nThe captain, more and more embarrassed, fell back upon the subject of\nthe tapestry,--\"'Tis, in sooth, a charming work!\" he exclaimed.\n\nWhereupon Colombe de Gaillefontaine, another beautiful blonde, with a\nwhite skin, dressed to the neck in blue damask, ventured a timid remark\nwhich she addressed to Fleur-de-Lys, in the hope that the handsome\ncaptain would reply to it, \"My dear Gondelaurier, have you seen the\ntapestries of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de la Roche-Guyon?\"\n\n\"Is not that the hotel in which is enclosed the garden of the Ling\u00c3\u00a8re\ndu Louvre?\" asked Diane de Christeuil with a laugh; for she had handsome\nteeth, and consequently laughed on every occasion.\n\n\"And where there is that big, old tower of the ancient wall of Paris,\"\nadded Amelotte de Montmichel, a pretty fresh and curly-headed brunette,\nwho had a habit of sighing just as the other laughed, without knowing\nwhy.\n\n\"My dear Colombe,\" interpolated Dame Aloise, \"do you not mean the hotel\nwhich belonged to Monsieur de Bacqueville, in the reign of King Charles\nVI.? there are indeed many superb high warp tapestries there.\"\n\n\"Charles VI.! Charles VI.!\" muttered the young captain, twirling his\nmoustache. \"Good heavens! what old things the good dame does remember!\"\n\nMadame de Gondelaurier continued, \"Fine tapestries, in truth. A work so\nesteemed that it passes as unrivalled.\"\n\nAt that moment B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re de Champchevrier, a slender little maid of\nseven years, who was peering into the square through the trefoils of\nthe balcony, exclaimed, \"Oh! look, fair Godmother Fleur-de-Lys, at that\npretty dancer who is dancing on the pavement and playing the tambourine\nin the midst of the loutish bourgeois!\"\n\nThe sonorous vibration of a tambourine was, in fact, audible. \"Some\ngypsy from Bohemia,\" said Fleur-de-Lys, turning carelessly toward the\nsquare.\n\n\"Look! look!\" exclaimed her lively companions; and they all ran to the\nedge of the balcony, while Fleur-de-Lys, rendered thoughtful by the\ncoldness of her betrothed, followed them slowly, and the latter,\nrelieved by this incident, which put an end to an embarrassing\nconversation, retreated to the farther end of the room, with the\nsatisfied air of a soldier released from duty. Nevertheless, the\nfair Fleur-de-Lys's was a charming and noble service, and such it had\nformerly appeared to him; but the captain had gradually become blase';\nthe prospect of a speedy marriage cooled him more every day. Moreover,\nhe was of a fickle disposition, and, must we say it, rather vulgar in\ntaste. Although of very noble birth, he had contracted in his official\nharness more than one habit of the common trooper. The tavern and its\naccompaniments pleased him. He was only at his ease amid gross language,\nmilitary gallantries, facile beauties, and successes yet more easy.\nHe had, nevertheless, received from his family some education and some\npoliteness of manner; but he had been thrown on the world too young, he\nhad been in garrison at too early an age, and every day the polish of\na gentleman became more and more effaced by the rough friction of his\ngendarme's cross-belt. While still continuing to visit her from time to\ntime, from a remnant of common respect, he felt doubly embarrassed with\nFleur-de-Lys; in the first place, because, in consequence of having\nscattered his love in all sorts of places, he had reserved very little\nfor her; in the next place, because, amid so many stiff, formal, and\ndecent ladies, he was in constant fear lest his mouth, habituated to\noaths, should suddenly take the bit in its teeth, and break out into the\nlanguage of the tavern. The effect can be imagined!\n\nMoreover, all this was mingled in him, with great pretentions to\nelegance, toilet, and a fine appearance. Let the reader reconcile these\nthings as best he can. I am simply the historian.\n\nHe had remained, therefore, for several minutes, leaning in silence\nagainst the carved jamb of the chimney, and thinking or not thinking,\nwhen Fleur-de-Lys suddenly turned and addressed him. After all, the poor\nyoung girl was pouting against the dictates of her heart.\n\n\"Fair cousin, did you not speak to us of a little Bohemian whom you\nsaved a couple of months ago, while making the patrol with the watch at\nnight, from the hands of a dozen robbers?\"\n\n\"I believe so, fair cousin,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Well,\" she resumed, \"perchance 'tis that same gypsy girl who is dancing\nyonder, on the church square. Come and see if you recognize her, fair\nCousin Phoebus.\"\n\nA secret desire for reconciliation was apparent in this gentle\ninvitation which she gave him to approach her, and in the care which she\ntook to call him by name. Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers (for it is\nhe whom the reader has had before his eyes since the beginning of this\nchapter) slowly approached the balcony. \"Stay,\" said Fleur-de-Lys,\nlaying her hand tenderly on Phoebus's arm; \"look at that little girl\nyonder, dancing in that circle. Is she your Bohemian?\"\n\nPhoebus looked, and said,--\n\n\"Yes, I recognize her by her goat.\"\n\n\"Oh! in fact, what a pretty little goat!\" said Amelotte, clasping her\nhands in admiration.\n\n\"Are his horns of real gold?\" inquired B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re.\n\nWithout moving from her arm-chair, Dame Aloise interposed, \"Is she not\none of those gypsy girls who arrived last year by the Gibard gate?\"\n\n\"Madame my mother,\" said Fleur-de-Lys gently, \"that gate is now called\nthe Porte d'Enfer.\"\n\nMademoiselle de Gondelaurier knew how her mother's antiquated mode of\nspeech shocked the captain. In fact, he began to sneer, and muttered\nbetween his teeth: \"Porte Gibard! Porte Gibard! 'Tis enough to make King\nCharles VI. pass by.\"\n\n\"Godmother!\" exclaimed B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re, whose eyes, incessantly in motion, had\nsuddenly been raised to the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame, \"who is\nthat black man up yonder?\"\n\nAll the young girls raised their eyes. A man was, in truth, leaning\non the balustrade which surmounted the northern tower, looking on the\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve. He was a priest. His costume could be plainly discerned, and his\nface resting on both his hands. But he stirred no more than if he had\nbeen a statue. His eyes, intently fixed, gazed into the Place.\n\nIt was something like the immobility of a bird of prey, who has just\ndiscovered a nest of sparrows, and is gazing at it.\n\n\"'Tis monsieur the archdeacon of Josas,\" said Fleur-de-Lys.\n\n\"You have good eyes if you can recognize him from here,\" said the\nGaillefontaine.\n\n\"How he is staring at the little dancer!\" went on Diane de Christeuil.\n\n\"Let the gypsy beware!\" said Fleur-de-Lys, \"for he loves not Egypt.\"\n\n\"'Tis a great shame for that man to look upon her thus,\" added Amelotte\nde Montmichel, \"for she dances delightfully.\"\n\n\"Fair cousin Phoebus,\" said Fleur-de-Lys suddenly, \"Since you know this\nlittle gypsy, make her a sign to come up here. It will amuse us.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed all the young girls, clapping their hands.\n\n\"Why! 'tis not worth while,\" replied Phoebus. \"She has forgotten me, no\ndoubt, and I know not so much as her name. Nevertheless, as you wish it,\nyoung ladies, I will make the trial.\" And leaning over the balustrade of\nthe balcony, he began to shout, \"Little one!\"\n\nThe dancer was not beating her tambourine at the moment. She turned her\nhead towards the point whence this call proceeded, her brilliant eyes\nrested on Phoebus, and she stopped short.\n\n\"Little one!\" repeated the captain; and he beckoned her to approach.\n\nThe young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a flame\nhad mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her tambourine under her arm,\nshe made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of\nthe house where Phoebus was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and\nwith the troubled look of a bird which is yielding to the fascination of\na serpent.\n\nA moment later, the tapestry porti\u00c3\u00a8re was raised, and the gypsy appeared\non the threshold of the chamber, blushing, confused, breathless, her\nlarge eyes drooping, and not daring to advance another step.\n\nB\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re clapped her hands.\n\nMeanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold. Her\nappearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls. It\nis certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome\nofficer animated them all, that his splendid uniform was the target of\nall their coquetries, and that from the moment he presented himself,\nthere existed among them a secret, suppressed rivalry, which they hardly\nacknowledged even to themselves, but which broke forth, none the less,\nevery instant, in their gestures and remarks. Nevertheless, as they were\nall very nearly equal in beauty, they contended with equal arms, and\neach could hope for the victory.--The arrival of the gypsy suddenly\ndestroyed this equilibrium. Her beauty was so rare, that, at the moment\nwhen she appeared at the entrance of the apartment, it seemed as though\nshe diffused a sort of light which was peculiar to herself. In that\nnarrow chamber, surrounded by that sombre frame of hangings and\nwoodwork, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than on\nthe public square. She was like a torch which has suddenly been brought\nfrom broad daylight into the dark. The noble damsels were dazzled by her\nin spite of themselves. Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded\nin her beauty. Hence, their battle front (may we be allowed the\nexpression,) was immediately altered, although they exchanged not a\nsingle word. But they understood each other perfectly. Women's instincts\ncomprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences\nof men. An enemy had just arrived; all felt it--all rallied together.\nOne drop of wine is sufficient to tinge a glass of water red; to diffuse\na certain degree of ill temper throughout a whole assembly of pretty\nwomen, the arrival of a prettier woman suffices, especially when there\nis but one man present.\n\nHence the welcome accorded to the gypsy was marvellously glacial. They\nsurveyed her from head to foot, then exchanged glances, and all was\nsaid; they understood each other. Meanwhile, the young girl was waiting\nto be spoken to, in such emotion that she dared not raise her eyelids.\n\nThe captain was the first to break the silence. \"Upon my word,\" said\nhe, in his tone of intrepid fatuity, \"here is a charming creature! What\nthink you of her, fair cousin?\"\n\nThis remark, which a more delicate admirer would have uttered in a lower\ntone, at least was not of a nature to dissipate the feminine jealousies\nwhich were on the alert before the gypsy.\n\nFleur-de-Lys replied to the captain with a bland affectation of\ndisdain;--\"Not bad.\"\n\nThe others whispered.\n\nAt length, Madame Aloise, who was not the less jealous because she was\nso for her daughter, addressed the dancer,--\"Approach, little one.\"\n\n\"Approach, little one!\" repeated, with comical dignity, little\nB\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re, who would have reached about as high as her hips.\n\nThe gypsy advanced towards the noble dame.\n\n\"Fair child,\" said Phoebus, with emphasis, taking several steps towards\nher, \"I do not know whether I have the supreme honor of being recognized\nby you.\"\n\nShe interrupted him, with a smile and a look full of infinite\nsweetness,--\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said she.\n\n\"She has a good memory,\" remarked Fleur-de-Lys.\n\n\"Come, now,\" resumed Phoebus, \"you escaped nimbly the other evening. Did\nI frighten you!\"\n\n\"Oh! no,\" said the gypsy.\n\nThere was in the intonation of that \"Oh! no,\" uttered after that \"Oh!\nyes,\" an ineffable something which wounded Fleur-de-Lys.\n\n\"You left me in your stead, my beauty,\" pursued the captain, whose\ntongue was unloosed when speaking to a girl out of the street, \"a\ncrabbed knave, one-eyed and hunchbacked, the bishop's bellringer,\nI believe. I have been told that by birth he is the bastard of\nan archdeacon and a devil. He has a pleasant name: he is called\n_Quatre-Temps_ (Ember Days), _Paques-Fleuries_ (Palm Sunday), Mardi-Gras\n(Shrove Tuesday), I know not what! The name of some festival when the\nbells are pealed! So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though\nyou were made for beadles! 'Tis too much. What the devil did that\nscreech-owl want with you? Hey, tell me!\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she replied.\n\n\"The inconceivable impudence! A bellringer carrying off a wench, like a\nvicomte! a lout poaching on the game of gentlemen! that is a rare piece\nof assurance. However, he paid dearly for it. Master Pierrat Torterue is\nthe harshest groom that ever curried a knave; and I can tell you, if\nit will be agreeable to you, that your bellringer's hide got a thorough\ndressing at his hands.\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" said the gypsy, in whom these words revived the memory of\nthe pillory.\n\nThe captain burst out laughing.\n\n\"Corne-de-boeuf! here's pity as well placed as a feather in a pig's\ntail! May I have as big a belly as a pope, if--\"\n\nHe stopped short. \"Pardon me, ladies; I believe that I was on the point\nof saying something foolish.\"\n\n\"Fie, sir\" said la Gaillefontaine.\n\n\"He talks to that creature in her own tongue!\" added Fleur-de-Lys, in\na low tone, her irritation increasing every moment. This irritation was\nnot diminished when she beheld the captain, enchanted with the gypsy,\nand, most of all, with himself, execute a pirouette on his heel,\nrepeating with coarse, na\u00c3\u00afve, and soldierly gallantry,--\n\n\"A handsome wench, upon my soul!\"\n\n\"Rather savagely dressed,\" said Diane de Christeuil, laughing to show\nher fine teeth.\n\nThis remark was a flash of light to the others. Not being able to impugn\nher beauty, they attacked her costume.\n\n\"That is true,\" said la Montmichel; \"what makes you run about the\nstreets thus, without guimpe or ruff?\"\n\n\"That petticoat is so short that it makes one tremble,\" added la\nGaillefontaine.\n\n\"My dear,\" continued Fleur-de-Lys, with decided sharpness, \"You will get\nyourself taken up by the sumptuary police for your gilded girdle.\"\n\n\"Little one, little one;\" resumed la Christeuil, with an implacable\nsmile, \"if you were to put respectable sleeves upon your arms they would\nget less sunburned.\"\n\nIt was, in truth, a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator\nthan Phoebus, to see how these beautiful maidens, with their envenomed\nand angry tongues, wound, serpent-like, and glided and writhed around\nthe street dancer. They were cruel and graceful; they searched and\nrummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and\ntinsel. There was no end to their laughter, irony, and humiliation.\nSarcasms rained down upon the gypsy, and haughty condescension and\nmalevolent looks. One would have thought they were young Roman dames\nthrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave. One would\nhave pronounced them elegant grayhounds, circling, with inflated\nnostrils, round a poor woodland fawn, whom the glance of their master\nforbade them to devour.\n\nAfter all, what was a miserable dancer on the public squares in the\npresence of these high-born maidens? They seemed to take no heed of her\npresence, and talked of her aloud, to her face, as of something unclean,\nabject, and yet, at the same time, passably pretty.\n\nThe gypsy was not insensible to these pin-pricks. From time to time a\nflush of shame, a flash of anger inflamed her eyes or her cheeks; with\ndisdain she made that little grimace with which the reader is already\nfamiliar, but she remained motionless; she fixed on Phoebus a sad,\nsweet, resigned look. There was also happiness and tenderness in that\ngaze. One would have said that she endured for fear of being expelled.\n\nPhoebus laughed, and took the gypsy's part with a mixture of\nimpertinence and pity.\n\n\"Let them talk, little one!\" he repeated, jingling his golden spurs. \"No\ndoubt your toilet is a little extravagant and wild, but what difference\ndoes that make with such a charming damsel as yourself?\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the blonde Gaillefontaine, drawing up her\nswan-like throat, with a bitter smile. \"I see that messieurs the archers\nof the king's police easily take fire at the handsome eyes of gypsies!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" said Phoebus.\n\nAt this reply uttered carelessly by the captain, like a stray stone,\nwhose fall one does not even watch, Colombe began to laugh, as well as\nDiane, Amelotte, and Fleur-de-Lys, into whose eyes at the same time a\ntear started.\n\nThe gypsy, who had dropped her eyes on the floor at the words of Colombe\nde Gaillefontaine, raised them beaming with joy and pride and fixed them\nonce more on Phoebus. She was very beautiful at that moment.\n\nThe old dame, who was watching this scene, felt offended, without\nunderstanding why.\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" she suddenly exclaimed, \"what is it moving about my legs?\nAh! the villanous beast!\"\n\nIt was the goat, who had just arrived, in search of his mistress, and\nwho, in dashing towards the latter, had begun by entangling his horns in\nthe pile of stuffs which the noble dame's garments heaped up on her feet\nwhen she was seated.\n\nThis created a diversion. The gypsy disentangled his horns without\nuttering a word.\n\n\"Oh! here's the little goat with golden hoofs!\" exclaimed B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re,\ndancing with joy.\n\nThe gypsy crouched down on her knees and leaned her cheek against the\nfondling head of the goat. One would have said that she was asking\npardon for having quitted it thus.\n\nMeanwhile, Diane had bent down to Colombe's ear.\n\n\"Ah! good heavens! why did not I think of that sooner? 'Tis the gypsy\nwith the goat. They say she is a sorceress, and that her goat executes\nvery miraculous tricks.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said Colombe, \"the goat must now amuse us in its turn, and\nperform a miracle for us.\"\n\nDiane and Colombe eagerly addressed the gypsy.\n\n\"Little one, make your goat perform a miracle.\"\n\n\"I do not know what you mean,\" replied the dancer.\n\n\"A miracle, a piece of magic, a bit of sorcery, in short.\"\n\n\"I do not understand.\" And she fell to caressing the pretty animal,\nrepeating, \"Djali! Djali!\"\n\nAt that moment Fleur-de-Lys noticed a little bag of embroidered leather\nsuspended from the neck of the goat,--\"What is that?\" she asked of the\ngypsy.\n\nThe gypsy raised her large eyes upon her and replied gravely,--\"That is\nmy secret.\"\n\n\"I should really like to know what your secret is,\" thought\nFleur-de-Lys.\n\nMeanwhile, the good dame had risen angrily,--\"Come now, gypsy, if\nneither you nor your goat can dance for us, what are you doing here?\"\n\nThe gypsy walked slowly towards the door, without making any reply.\nBut the nearer she approached it, the more her pace slackened. An\nirresistible magnet seemed to hold her. Suddenly she turned her eyes,\nwet with tears, towards Phoebus, and halted.\n\n\"True God!\" exclaimed the captain, \"that's not the way to depart. Come\nback and dance something for us. By the way, my sweet love, what is your\nname?\"\n\n\"La Esmeralda,\" said the dancer, never taking her eyes from him.\n\nAt this strange name, a burst of wild laughter broke from the young\ngirls.\n\n\"Here's a terrible name for a young lady,\" said Diane.\n\n\"You see well enough,\" retorted Amelotte, \"that she is an enchantress.\"\n\n\"My dear,\" exclaimed Dame Aloise solemnly, \"your parents did not commit\nthe sin of giving you that name at the baptismal font.\"\n\nIn the meantime, several minutes previously, B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re had coaxed the\ngoat into a corner of the room with a marchpane cake, without any one\nhaving noticed her. In an instant they had become good friends. The\ncurious child had detached the bag from the goat's neck, had opened\nit, and had emptied out its contents on the rush matting; it was an\nalphabet, each letter of which was separately inscribed on a tiny block\nof boxwood. Hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting,\nwhen the child, with surprise, beheld the goat (one of whose \"miracles\"\nthis was no doubt), draw out certain letters with its golden hoof, and\narrange them, with gentle pushes, in a certain order. In a moment they\nconstituted a word, which the goat seemed to have been trained to write,\nso little hesitation did it show in forming it, and B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00a8re suddenly\nexclaimed, clasping her hands in admiration,--\n\n\"Godmother Fleur-de-Lys, see what the goat has just done!\"\n\nFleur-de-Lys ran up and trembled. The letters arranged upon the floor\nformed this word,--\n\n\n         PHOEBUS.\n\n\n\"Was it the goat who wrote that?\" she inquired in a changed voice.\n\n\"Yes, godmother,\" replied B\u00c3\u00a9rang\u00c3\u00aare.\n\nIt was impossible to doubt it; the child did not know how to write.\n\n\"This is the secret!\" thought Fleur-de-Lys.\n\nMeanwhile, at the child's exclamation, all had hastened up, the mother,\nthe young girls, the gypsy, and the officer.\n\nThe gypsy beheld the piece of folly which the goat had committed. She\nturned red, then pale, and began to tremble like a culprit before the\ncaptain, who gazed at her with a smile of satisfaction and amazement.\n\n\"Phoebus!\" whispered the young girls, stupefied: \"'tis the captain's\nname!\"\n\n\"You have a marvellous memory!\" said Fleur-de-Lys, to the petrified\ngypsy. Then, bursting into sobs: \"Oh!\" she stammered mournfully, hiding\nher face in both her beautiful hands, \"she is a magician!\" And she\nheard another and a still more bitter voice at the bottom of her heart,\nsaying,--\"She is a rival!\"\n\nShe fell fainting.\n\n\"My daughter! my daughter!\" cried the terrified mother. \"Begone, you\ngypsy of hell!\"\n\nIn a twinkling, La Esmeralda gathered up the unlucky letters, made a\nsign to Djali, and went out through one door, while Fleur-de-Lys was\nbeing carried out through the other.\n\nCaptain Phoebus, on being left alone, hesitated for a moment between the\ntwo doors, then he followed the gypsy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. A PRIEST AND A PHILOSOPHER ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.\n\n\n\nThe priest whom the young girls had observed at the top of the North\ntower, leaning over the Place and so attentive to the dance of the\ngypsy, was, in fact, Archdeacon Claude Frollo.\n\nOur readers have not forgotten the mysterious cell which the archdeacon\nhad reserved for himself in that tower. (I do not know, by the way be\nit said, whether it be not the same, the interior of which can be seen\nto-day through a little square window, opening to the east at the height\nof a man above the platform from which the towers spring; a bare and\ndilapidated den, whose badly plastered walls are ornamented here\nand there, at the present day, with some wretched yellow engravings\nrepresenting the fa\u00c3\u00a7ades of cathedrals. I presume that this hole is\njointly inhabited by bats and spiders, and that, consequently, it wages\na double war of extermination on the flies).\n\nEvery day, an hour before sunset, the archdeacon ascended the staircase\nto the tower, and shut himself up in this cell, where he sometimes\npassed whole nights. That day, at the moment when, standing before the\nlow door of his retreat, he was fitting into the lock the complicated\nlittle key which he always carried about him in the purse suspended to\nhis side, a sound of tambourine and castanets had reached his ear. These\nsounds came from the Place du Parvis. The cell, as we have already said,\nhad only one window opening upon the rear of the church. Claude Frollo\nhad hastily withdrawn the key, and an instant later, he was on the top\nof the tower, in the gloomy and pensive attitude in which the maidens\nhad seen him.\n\nThere he stood, grave, motionless, absorbed in one look and one thought.\nAll Paris lay at his feet, with the thousand spires of its edifices and\nits circular horizon of gentle hills--with its river winding under its\nbridges, and its people moving to and fro through its streets,--with\nthe clouds of its smoke,--with the mountainous chain of its roofs which\npresses Notre-Dame in its doubled folds; but out of all the city,\nthe archdeacon gazed at one corner only of the pavement, the Place du\nParvis; in all that throng at but one figure,--the gypsy.\n\nIt would have been difficult to say what was the nature of this look,\nand whence proceeded the flame that flashed from it. It was a fixed\ngaze, which was, nevertheless, full of trouble and tumult. And, from the\nprofound immobility of his whole body, barely agitated at intervals\nby an involuntary shiver, as a tree is moved by the wind; from the\nstiffness of his elbows, more marble than the balustrade on which\nthey leaned; or the sight of the petrified smile which contracted his\nface,--one would have said that nothing living was left about Claude\nFrollo except his eyes.\n\nThe gypsy was dancing; she was twirling her tambourine on the tip of her\nfinger, and tossing it into the air as she danced Proven\u00c3\u00a7al sarabands;\nagile, light, joyous, and unconscious of the formidable gaze which\ndescended perpendicularly upon her head.\n\nThe crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in\nred and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated\nhimself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the goat's head\non his knees. This man seemed to be the gypsy's companion. Claude Frollo\ncould not distinguish his features from his elevated post.\n\nFrom the moment when the archdeacon caught sight of this stranger, his\nattention seemed divided between him and the dancer, and his face became\nmore and more gloomy. All at once he rose upright, and a quiver ran\nthrough his whole body: \"Who is that man?\" he muttered between his\nteeth: \"I have always seen her alone before!\"\n\nThen he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase,\nand once more descended. As he passed the door of the bell chamber,\nwhich was ajar, he saw something which struck him; he beheld Quasimodo,\nwho, leaning through an opening of one of those slate penthouses which\nresemble enormous blinds, appeared also to be gazing at the Place. He\nwas engaged in so profound a contemplation, that he did not notice the\npassage of his adopted father. His savage eye had a singular expression;\nit was a charmed, tender look. \"This is strange!\" murmured Claude. \"Is\nit the gypsy at whom he is thus gazing?\" He continued his descent. At\nthe end of a few minutes, the anxious archdeacon entered upon the Place\nfrom the door at the base of the tower.\n\n\"What has become of the gypsy girl?\" he said, mingling with the group of\nspectators which the sound of the tambourine had collected.\n\n\"I know not,\" replied one of his neighbors, \"I think that she has gone\nto make some of her fandangoes in the house opposite, whither they have\ncalled her.\"\n\nIn the place of the gypsy, on the carpet, whose arabesques had seemed to\nvanish but a moment previously by the capricious figures of her dance,\nthe archdeacon no longer beheld any one but the red and yellow man,\nwho, in order to earn a few testers in his turn, was walking round the\ncircle, with his elbows on his hips, his head thrown back, his face red,\nhis neck outstretched, with a chair between his teeth. To the chair he\nhad fastened a cat, which a neighbor had lent, and which was spitting in\ngreat affright.\n\n\"Notre-Dame!\" exclaimed the archdeacon, at the moment when the juggler,\nperspiring heavily, passed in front of him with his pyramid of chair and\nhis cat, \"What is Master Pierre Gringoire doing here?\"\n\nThe harsh voice of the archdeacon threw the poor fellow into such a\ncommotion that he lost his equilibrium, together with his whole edifice,\nand the chair and the cat tumbled pell-mell upon the heads of the\nspectators, in the midst of inextinguishable hootings.\n\nIt is probable that Master Pierre Gringoire (for it was indeed he) would\nhave had a sorry account to settle with the neighbor who owned the cat,\nand all the bruised and scratched faces which surrounded him, if he\nhad not hastened to profit by the tumult to take refuge in the church,\nwhither Claude Frollo had made him a sign to follow him.\n\nThe cathedral was already dark and deserted; the side-aisles were full\nof shadows, and the lamps of the chapels began to shine out like stars,\nso black had the vaulted ceiling become. Only the great rose window of\nthe fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, whose thousand colors were steeped in a ray of horizontal\nsunlight, glittered in the gloom like a mass of diamonds, and threw its\ndazzling reflection to the other end of the nave.\n\nWhen they had advanced a few paces, Dom Claude placed his back against a\npillar, and gazed intently at Gringoire. The gaze was not the one which\nGringoire feared, ashamed as he was of having been caught by a grave and\nlearned person in the costume of a buffoon. There was nothing mocking or\nironical in the priest's glance, it was serious, tranquil, piercing. The\narchdeacon was the first to break the silence.\n\n\"Come now, Master Pierre. You are to explain many things to me. And\nfirst of all, how comes it that you have not been seen for two months,\nand that now one finds you in the public squares, in a fine equipment in\ntruth! Motley red and yellow, like a Caudebec apple?\"\n\n\"Messire,\" said Gringoire, piteously, \"it is, in fact, an amazing\naccoutrement. You see me no more comfortable in it than a cat coiffed\nwith a calabash. 'Tis very ill done, I am conscious, to expose messieurs\nthe sergeants of the watch to the liability of cudgelling beneath this\ncassock the humerus of a Pythagorean philosopher. But what would you\nhave, my reverend master? 'tis the fault of my ancient jerkin, which\nabandoned me in cowardly wise, at the beginning of the winter, under the\npretext that it was falling into tatters, and that it required repose in\nthe basket of a rag-picker. What is one to do? Civilization has not yet\narrived at the point where one can go stark naked, as ancient Diogenes\nwished. Add that a very cold wind was blowing, and 'tis not in the month\nof January that one can successfully attempt to make humanity take\nthis new step. This garment presented itself, I took it, and I left my\nancient black smock, which, for a hermetic like myself, was far\nfrom being hermetically closed. Behold me then, in the garments of a\nstage-player, like Saint Genest. What would you have? 'tis an eclipse.\nApollo himself tended the flocks of Admetus.\"\n\n\"'Tis a fine profession that you are engaged in!\" replied the\narchdeacon.\n\n\"I agree, my master, that 'tis better to philosophize and poetize, to\nblow the flame in the furnace, or to receive it from carry cats on a\nshield. So, when you addressed me, I was as foolish as an ass before a\nturnspit. But what would you have, messire? One must eat every day, and\nthe finest Alexandrine verses are not worth a bit of Brie cheese. Now, I\nmade for Madame Marguerite of Flanders, that famous epithalamium, as you\nknow, and the city will not pay me, under the pretext that it was not\nexcellent; as though one could give a tragedy of Sophocles for four\ncrowns! Hence, I was on the point of dying with hunger. Happily, I found\nthat I was rather strong in the jaw; so I said to this jaw,--perform\nsome feats of strength and of equilibrium: nourish thyself. _Ale te\nipsam_. A pack of beggars who have become my good friends, have taught\nme twenty sorts of herculean feats, and now I give to my teeth every\nevening the bread which they have earned during the day by the sweat of\nmy brow. After all, concede, I grant that it is a sad employment for\nmy intellectual faculties, and that man is not made to pass his life in\nbeating the tambourine and biting chairs. But, reverend master, it is\nnot sufficient to pass one's life, one must earn the means for life.\"\n\nDom Claude listened in silence. All at once his deep-set eye assumed so\nsagacious and penetrating an expression, that Gringoire felt himself, so\nto speak, searched to the bottom of the soul by that glance.\n\n\"Very good, Master Pierre; but how comes it that you are now in company\nwith that gypsy dancer?\"\n\n\"In faith!\" said Gringoire, \"'tis because she is my wife and I am her\nhusband.\"\n\nThe priest's gloomy eyes flashed into flame.\n\n\"Have you done that, you wretch!\" he cried, seizing Gringoire's arm with\nfury; \"have you been so abandoned by God as to raise your hand against\nthat girl?\"\n\n\"On my chance of paradise, monseigneur,\" replied Gringoire, trembling\nin every limb, \"I swear to you that I have never touched her, if that is\nwhat disturbs you.\"\n\n\"Then why do you talk of husband and wife?\" said the priest. Gringoire\nmade haste to relate to him as succinctly as possible, all that the\nreader already knows, his adventure in the Court of Miracles and the\nbroken-crock marriage. It appeared, moreover, that this marriage had led\nto no results whatever, and that each evening the gypsy girl cheated\nhim of his nuptial right as on the first day. \"'Tis a mortification,\"\nhe said in conclusion, \"but that is because I have had the misfortune to\nwed a virgin.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded the archdeacon, who had been gradually\nappeased by this recital.\n\n\"'Tis very difficult to explain,\" replied the poet. \"It is a\nsuperstition. My wife is, according to what an old thief, who is called\namong us the Duke of Egypt, has told me, a foundling or a lost child,\nwhich is the same thing. She wears on her neck an amulet which, it is\naffirmed, will cause her to meet her parents some day, but which will\nlose its virtue if the young girl loses hers. Hence it follows that both\nof us remain very virtuous.\"\n\n\"So,\" resumed Claude, whose brow cleared more and more, \"you believe,\nMaster Pierre, that this creature has not been approached by any man?\"\n\n\"What would you have a man do, Dom Claude, as against a superstition?\nShe has got that in her head. I assuredly esteem as a rarity this\nnunlike prudery which is preserved untamed amid those Bohemian girls\nwho are so easily brought into subjection. But she has three things to\nprotect her: the Duke of Egypt, who has taken her under his safeguard,\nreckoning, perchance, on selling her to some gay abb\u00c3\u00a9; all his tribe,\nwho hold her in singular veneration, like a Notre-Dame; and a certain\ntiny poignard, which the buxom dame always wears about her, in some\nnook, in spite of the ordinances of the provost, and which one causes to\nfly out into her hands by squeezing her waist. 'Tis a proud wasp, I can\ntell you!\"\n\nThe archdeacon pressed Gringoire with questions.\n\nLa Esmeralda, in the judgment of Gringoire, was an inoffensive and\ncharming creature, pretty, with the exception of a pout which was\npeculiar to her; a na\u00c3\u00afve and passionate damsel, ignorant of everything\nand enthusiastic about everything; not yet aware of the difference\nbetween a man and a woman, even in her dreams; made like that; wild\nespecially over dancing, noise, the open air; a sort of woman bee, with\ninvisible wings on her feet, and living in a whirlwind. She owed this\nnature to the wandering life which she had always led. Gringoire had\nsucceeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed Spain\nand Catalonia, even to Sicily; he believed that she had even been taken\nby the caravan of Zingari, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom\nof Algiers, a country situated in Achaia, which country adjoins, on one\nside Albania and Greece; on the other, the Sicilian Sea, which is the\nroad to Constantinople. The Bohemians, said Gringoire, were vassals of\nthe King of Algiers, in his quality of chief of the White Moors. One\nthing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very\nyoung, by way of Hungary. From all these countries the young girl had\nbrought back fragments of queer jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which\nmade her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African.\nHowever, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for\nher gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her\nsongs. She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two\npersons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked nun of the\nTour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge\nagainst these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that\nthe latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her\nwithout casting at her looks and words which frightened her.\n\nThe mention of this last circumstance disturbed the archdeacon greatly,\nthough Gringoire paid no attention to his perturbation; to such an\nextent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the\nsingular details of the evening on which he had met the gypsy, and\nthe presence of the archdeacon in it all. Otherwise, the little dancer\nfeared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against\nthose trials for magic which were so frequently instituted against gypsy\nwomen. And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of\nher husband. After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic\nmarriage very patiently. It meant a shelter and bread at least. Every\nmorning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the\ngypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks**\nin the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her,\nallowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep\nof the just. A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said,\nand well adapted to revery. And then, on his soul and conscience, the\nphilosopher was not very sure that he was madly in love with the gypsy.\nHe loved her goat almost as dearly. It was a charming animal, gentle,\nintelligent, clever; a learned goat. Nothing was more common in the\nMiddle Ages than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and\noften led their instructors to the stake. But the witchcraft of the goat\nwith the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic. Gringoire\nexplained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest\ndeeply. In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the\ntambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from\nhim the trick desired. He had been trained to this by the gypsy, who\npossessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months\nhad sufficed to teach the goat to write, with movable letters, the word\n\"Phoebus.\"\n\n\n     *  An ancient Burgundian coin.\n\n     ** An ancient French coin.\n\n\n\"'Phoebus!'\" said the priest; \"why 'Phoebus'?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" replied Gringoire. \"Perhaps it is a word which she\nbelieves to be endowed with some magic and secret virtue. She often\nrepeats it in a low tone when she thinks that she is alone.\"\n\n\"Are you sure,\" persisted Claude, with his penetrating glance, \"that it\nis only a word and not a name?\"\n\n\"The name of whom?\" said the poet.\n\n\"How should I know?\" said the priest.\n\n\"This is what I imagine, messire. These Bohemians are something like\nGuebrs, and adore the sun. Hence, Phoebus.\"\n\n\"That does not seem so clear to me as to you, Master Pierre.\"\n\n\"After all, that does not concern me. Let her mumble her Phoebus at her\npleasure. One thing is certain, that Djali loves me almost as much as he\ndoes her.\"\n\n\"Who is Djali?\"\n\n\"The goat.\"\n\nThe archdeacon dropped his chin into his hand, and appeared to reflect\nfor a moment. All at once he turned abruptly to Gringoire once more.\n\n\"And do you swear to me that you have not touched her?\"\n\n\"Whom?\" said Gringoire; \"the goat?\"\n\n\"No, that woman.\"\n\n\"My wife? I swear to you that I have not.\"\n\n\"You are often alone with her?\"\n\n\"A good hour every evening.\"\n\nPorn Claude frowned.\n\n\"Oh! oh! _Solus cum sola non cogitabuntur orare Pater Noster_.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul, I could say the _Pater_, and the _Ave Maria_, and\nthe _Credo in Deum patrem omnipotentem_ without her paying any more\nattention to me than a chicken to a church.\"\n\n\"Swear to me, by the body of your mother,\" repeated the archdeacon\nviolently, \"that you have not touched that creature with even the tip of\nyour finger.\"\n\n\"I will also swear it by the head of my father, for the two things\nhave more affinity between them. But, my reverend master, permit me a\nquestion in my turn.\"\n\n\"Speak, sir.\"\n\n\"What concern is it of yours?\"\n\nThe archdeacon's pale face became as crimson as the cheek of a young\ngirl. He remained for a moment without answering; then, with visible\nembarrassment,--\n\n\"Listen, Master Pierre Gringoire. You are not yet damned, so far as\nI know. I take an interest in you, and wish you well. Now the least\ncontact with that Egyptian of the demon would make you the vassal of\nSatan. You know that 'tis always the body which ruins the soul. Woe to\nyou if you approach that woman! That is all.\"\n\n\"I tried once,\" said Gringoire, scratching his ear; \"it was the first\nday: but I got stung.\"\n\n\"You were so audacious, Master Pierre?\" and the priest's brow clouded\nover again.\n\n\"On another occasion,\" continued the poet, with a smile, \"I peeped\nthrough the keyhole, before going to bed, and I beheld the most\ndelicious dame in her shift that ever made a bed creak under her bare\nfoot.\"\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" cried the priest, with a terrible look; and, giving\nthe amazed Gringoire a push on the shoulders, he plunged, with long\nstrides, under the gloomiest arcades of the cathedral.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE BELLS.\n\n\n\nAfter the morning in the pillory, the neighbors of Notre-Dame thought\nthey noticed that Quasimodo's ardor for ringing had grown cool.\nFormerly, there had been peals for every occasion, long morning\nserenades, which lasted from prime to compline; peals from the belfry\nfor a high mass, rich scales drawn over the smaller bells for a wedding,\nfor a christening, and mingling in the air like a rich embroidery of all\nsorts of charming sounds. The old church, all vibrating and sonorous,\nwas in a perpetual joy of bells. One was constantly conscious of the\npresence of a spirit of noise and caprice, who sang through all those\nmouths of brass. Now that spirit seemed to have departed; the cathedral\nseemed gloomy, and gladly remained silent; festivals and funerals had\nthe simple peal, dry and bare, demanded by the ritual, nothing more. Of\nthe double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell\nwithout, the organ alone remained. One would have said that there was\nno longer a musician in the belfry. Quasimodo was always there,\nnevertheless; what, then, had happened to him? Was it that the shame and\ndespair of the pillory still lingered in the bottom of his heart, that\nthe lashes of his tormentor's whip reverberated unendingly in his soul,\nand that the sadness of such treatment had wholly extinguished in him\neven his passion for the bells? or was it that Marie had a rival in the\nheart of the bellringer of Notre-Dame, and that the great bell and her\nfourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more\nbeautiful?\n\nIt chanced that, in the year of grace 1482, Annunciation Day fell on\nTuesday, the twenty-fifth of March. That day the air was so pure and\nlight that Quasimodo felt some returning affection for his bells. He\ntherefore ascended the northern tower while the beadle below was opening\nwide the doors of the church, which were then enormous panels of stout\nwood, covered with leather, bordered with nails of gilded iron, and\nframed in carvings \"very artistically elaborated.\"\n\nOn arriving in the lofty bell chamber, Quasimodo gazed for some time\nat the six bells and shook his head sadly, as though groaning over some\nforeign element which had interposed itself in his heart between them\nand him. But when he had set them to swinging, when he felt that cluster\nof bells moving under his hand, when he saw, for he did not hear it, the\npalpitating octave ascend and descend that sonorous scale, like a bird\nhopping from branch to branch; when the demon Music, that demon who\nshakes a sparkling bundle of strette, trills and arpeggios, had taken\npossession of the poor deaf man, he became happy once more, he forgot\neverything, and his heart expanding, made his face beam.\n\nHe went and came, he beat his hands together, he ran from rope to rope,\nhe animated the six singers with voice and gesture, like the leader of\nan orchestra who is urging on intelligent musicians.\n\n\"Go on,\" said he, \"go on, go on, Gabrielle, pour out all thy noise\ninto the Place, 'tis a festival to-day. No laziness, Thibauld; thou art\nrelaxing; go on, go on, then, art thou rusted, thou sluggard? That is\nwell! quick! quick! let not thy clapper be seen! Make them all deaf like\nme. That's it, Thibauld, bravely done! Guillaume! Guillaume! thou art\nthe largest, and Pasquier is the smallest, and Pasquier does best. Let\nus wager that those who hear him will understand him better than they\nunderstand thee. Good! good! my Gabrielle, stoutly, more stoutly! Eli!\nwhat are you doing up aloft there, you two Moineaux (sparrows)? I do not\nsee you making the least little shred of noise. What is the meaning of\nthose beaks of copper which seem to be gaping when they should sing?\nCome, work now, 'tis the Feast of the Annunciation. The sun is fine, the\nchime must be fine also. Poor Guillaume! thou art all out of breath, my\nbig fellow!\"\n\nHe was wholly absorbed in spurring on his bells, all six of which vied\nwith each other in leaping and shaking their shining haunches, like\na noisy team of Spanish mules, pricked on here and there by the\napostrophes of the muleteer.\n\nAll at once, on letting his glance fall between the large slate scales\nwhich cover the perpendicular wall of the bell tower at a certain\nheight, he beheld on the square a young girl, fantastically dressed,\nstop, spread out on the ground a carpet, on which a small goat took\nup its post, and a group of spectators collect around her. This sight\nsuddenly changed the course of his ideas, and congealed his enthusiasm\nas a breath of air congeals melted rosin. He halted, turned his back to\nthe bells, and crouched down behind the projecting roof of slate, fixing\nupon the dancer that dreamy, sweet, and tender look which had already\nastonished the archdeacon on one occasion. Meanwhile, the forgotten\nbells died away abruptly and all together, to the great disappointment\nof the lovers of bell ringing, who were listening in good faith to the\npeal from above the Pont du Change, and who went away dumbfounded, like\na dog who has been offered a bone and given a stone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. _ANANKE_.\n\n\nIt chanced that upon a fine morning in this same month of March, I think\nit was on Saturday the 29th, Saint Eustache's day, our young friend the\nstudent, Jehan Frollo du Moulin, perceived, as he was dressing himself,\nthat his breeches, which contained his purse, gave out no metallic ring.\n\"Poor purse,\" he said, drawing it from his fob, \"what! not the smallest\nparisis! how cruelly the dice, beer-pots, and Venus have depleted thee!\nHow empty, wrinkled, limp, thou art! Thou resemblest the throat of a\nfury! I ask you, Messer Cicero, and Messer Seneca, copies of whom, all\ndog's-eared, I behold scattered on the floor, what profits it me to\nknow, better than any governor of the mint, or any Jew on the Pont aux\nChangeurs, that a golden crown stamped with a crown is worth thirty-five\nunzains of twenty-five sous, and eight deniers parisis apiece, and\nthat a crown stamped with a crescent is worth thirty-six unzains of\ntwenty-six sous, six deniers tournois apiece, if I have not a single\nwretched black liard to risk on the double-six! Oh! Consul Cicero! this\nis no calamity from which one extricates one's self with periphrases,\n_quemadmodum_, and _verum enim vero_!\"\n\nHe dressed himself sadly. An idea had occurred to him as he laced his\nboots, but he rejected it at first; nevertheless, it returned, and he\nput on his waistcoat wrong side out, an evident sign of violent internal\ncombat. At last he dashed his cap roughly on the floor, and exclaimed:\n\"So much the worse! Let come of it what may. I am going to my brother! I\nshall catch a sermon, but I shall catch a crown.\"\n\nThen he hastily donned his long jacket with furred half-sleeves, picked\nup his cap, and went out like a man driven to desperation.\n\nHe descended the Rue de la Harpe toward the City. As he passed the\nRue de la Huchette, the odor of those admirable spits, which were\nincessantly turning, tickled his olfactory apparatus, and he bestowed\na loving glance toward the Cyclopean roast, which one day drew from the\nFranciscan friar, Calatagirone, this pathetic exclamation: _Veramente,\nqueste rotisserie sono cosa stupenda_!* But Jehan had not the\nwherewithal to buy a breakfast, and he plunged, with a profound sigh,\nunder the gateway of the Petit-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet, that enormous double trefoil of\nmassive towers which guarded the entrance to the City.\n\n\n     *  Truly, these roastings are a stupendous thing!\n\n\nHe did not even take the trouble to cast a stone in passing, as was the\nusage, at the miserable statue of that P\u00c3\u00a9rinet Leclerc who had delivered\nup the Paris of Charles VI. to the English, a crime which his effigy,\nits face battered with stones and soiled with mud, expiated for three\ncenturies at the corner of the Rue de la Harpe and the Rue de Buci, as\nin an eternal pillory.\n\nThe Petit-Pont traversed, the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve crossed, Jehan\nde Molendino found himself in front of Notre-Dame. Then indecision\nseized upon him once more, and he paced for several minutes round the\nstatue of M. Legris, repeating to himself with anguish: \"The sermon is\nsure, the crown is doubtful.\"\n\nHe stopped a beadle who emerged from the cloister,--\"Where is monsieur\nthe archdeacon of Josas?\"\n\n\"I believe that he is in his secret cell in the tower,\" said the beadle;\n\"I should advise you not to disturb him there, unless you come from some\none like the pope or monsieur the king.\"\n\nJehan clapped his hands.\n\n\"_B\u00c3\u00a9cliable_! here's a magnificent chance to see the famous sorcery\ncell!\"\n\nThis reflection having brought him to a decision, he plunged resolutely\ninto the small black doorway, and began the ascent of the spiral of\nSaint-Gilles, which leads to the upper stories of the tower. \"I am\ngoing to see,\" he said to himself on the way. \"By the ravens of the Holy\nVirgin! it must needs be a curious thing, that cell which my reverend\nbrother hides so secretly! 'Tis said that he lights up the kitchens of\nhell there, and that he cooks the philosopher's stone there over a hot\nfire. _B\u00c3\u00a9dieu_! I care no more for the philosopher's stone than for a\npebble, and I would rather find over his furnace an omelette of Easter\neggs and bacon, than the biggest philosopher's stone in the world.\"'\n\nOn arriving at the gallery of slender columns, he took breath for a\nmoment, and swore against the interminable staircase by I know not how\nmany million cartloads of devils; then he resumed his ascent through\nthe narrow door of the north tower, now closed to the public.\nSeveral moments after passing the bell chamber, he came upon a little\nlanding-place, built in a lateral niche, and under the vault of a low,\npointed door, whose enormous lock and strong iron bars he was enabled\nto see through a loophole pierced in the opposite circular wall of the\nstaircase. Persons desirous of visiting this door at the present day\nwill recognize it by this inscription engraved in white letters on the\nblack wall: \"J'ADORE CORALIE, 1823. SIGNE UGENE.\" \"Sign\u00c3\u00a9\" stands in the\ntext.\n\n\"Ugh!\" said the scholar; \"'tis here, no doubt.\"\n\nThe key was in the lock, the door was very close to him; he gave it a\ngentle push and thrust his head through the opening.\n\nThe reader cannot have failed to turn over the admirable works of\nRembrandt, that Shakespeare of painting. Amid so many marvellous\nengravings, there is one etching in particular, which is supposed\nto represent Doctor Faust, and which it is impossible to contemplate\nwithout being dazzled. It represents a gloomy cell; in the centre is a\ntable loaded with hideous objects; skulls, spheres, alembics, compasses,\nhieroglyphic parchments. The doctor is before this table clad in his\nlarge coat and covered to the very eyebrows with his furred cap. He is\nvisible only to his waist. He has half risen from his immense arm-chair,\nhis clenched fists rest on the table, and he is gazing with curiosity\nand terror at a large luminous circle, formed of magic letters, which\ngleams from the wall beyond, like the solar spectrum in a dark chamber.\nThis cabalistic sun seems to tremble before the eye, and fills the wan\ncell with its mysterious radiance. It is horrible and it is beautiful.\n\nSomething very similar to Faust's cell presented itself to Jehan's view,\nwhen he ventured his head through the half-open door. It also was a\ngloomy and sparsely lighted retreat. There also stood a large arm-chair\nand a large table, compasses, alembics, skeletons of animals suspended\nfrom the ceiling, a globe rolling on the floor, hippocephali mingled\npromiscuously with drinking cups, in which quivered leaves of gold,\nskulls placed upon vellum checkered with figures and characters, huge\nmanuscripts piled up wide open, without mercy on the cracking corners of\nthe parchment; in short, all the rubbish of science, and everywhere\non this confusion dust and spiders' webs; but there was no circle of\nluminous letters, no doctor in an ecstasy contemplating the flaming\nvision, as the eagle gazes upon the sun.\n\nNevertheless, the cell was not deserted. A man was seated in the\narm-chair, and bending over the table. Jehan, to whom his back was\nturned, could see only his shoulders and the back of his skull; but\nhe had no difficulty in recognizing that bald head, which nature had\nprovided with an eternal tonsure, as though desirous of marking, by this\nexternal symbol, the archdeacon's irresistible clerical vocation.\n\nJehan accordingly recognized his brother; but the door had been\nopened so softly, that nothing warned Dom Claude of his presence. The\ninquisitive scholar took advantage of this circumstance to examine the\ncell for a few moments at his leisure. A large furnace, which he had\nnot at first observed, stood to the left of the arm-chair, beneath the\nwindow. The ray of light which penetrated through this aperture made\nits way through a spider's circular web, which tastefully inscribed its\ndelicate rose in the arch of the window, and in the centre of which the\ninsect architect hung motionless, like the hub of this wheel of lace.\nUpon the furnace were accumulated in disorder, all sorts of vases,\nearthenware bottles, glass retorts, and mattresses of charcoal. Jehan\nobserved, with a sigh, that there was no frying-pan. \"How cold the\nkitchen utensils are!\" he said to himself.\n\nIn fact, there was no fire in the furnace, and it seemed as though none\nhad been lighted for a long time. A glass mask, which Jehan noticed\namong the utensils of alchemy, and which served no doubt, to protect the\narchdeacon's face when he was working over some substance to be dreaded,\nlay in one corner covered with dust and apparently forgotten. Beside it\nlay a pair of bellows no less dusty, the upper side of which bore this\ninscription incrusted in copper letters: SPIRA SPERA.\n\nOther inscriptions were written, in accordance with the fashion of the\nhermetics, in great numbers on the walls; some traced with ink, others\nengraved with a metal point. There were, moreover, Gothic letters,\nHebrew letters, Greek letters, and Roman letters, pell-mell; the\ninscriptions overflowed at haphazard, on top of each other, the more\nrecent effacing the more ancient, and all entangled with each other,\nlike the branches in a thicket, like pikes in an affray. It was, in\nfact, a strangely confused mingling of all human philosophies, all\nreveries, all human wisdom. Here and there one shone out from among the\nrest like a banner among lance heads. Generally, it was a brief Greek\nor Roman device, such as the Middle Ages knew so well how to\nformulate.--_Unde? Inde?--Homo homini monstrurn-Ast'ra, castra, nomen,\nnumen.--Meya Bibklov, ueya xaxov.--Sapere aude. Fiat ubi vult_--etc.;\nsometimes a word devoid of all apparent sense, _Avayxoqpayia_, which\npossibly contained a bitter allusion to the regime of the cloister;\nsometimes a simple maxim of clerical discipline formulated in a regular\nhexameter _Coelestem dominum terrestrem dicite dominum_. There was\nalso Hebrew jargon, of which Jehan, who as yet knew but little Greek,\nunderstood nothing; and all were traversed in every direction by stars,\nby figures of men or animals, and by intersecting triangles; and this\ncontributed not a little to make the scrawled wall of the cell resemble\na sheet of paper over which a monkey had drawn back and forth a pen\nfilled with ink.\n\nThe whole chamber, moreover, presented a general aspect of abandonment\nand dilapidation; and the bad state of the utensils induced the\nsupposition that their owner had long been distracted from his labors\nby other preoccupations. Meanwhile, this master, bent over a vast\nmanuscript, ornamented with fantastical illustrations, appeared to be\ntormented by an idea which incessantly mingled with his meditations.\nThat at least was Jehan's idea, when he heard him exclaim, with the\nthoughtful breaks of a dreamer thinking aloud,--\n\n\"Yes, Manou said it, and Zoroaster taught it! the sun is born from fire,\nthe moon from the sun; fire is the soul of the universe; its elementary\natoms pour forth and flow incessantly upon the world through infinite\nchannels! At the point where these currents intersect each other in the\nheavens, they produce light; at their points of intersection on earth,\nthey produce gold. Light, gold; the same thing! From fire to the\nconcrete state. The difference between the visible and the palpable,\nbetween the fluid and the solid in the same substance, between water and\nice, nothing more. These are no dreams; it is the general law of nature.\nBut what is one to do in order to extract from science the secret of\nthis general law? What! this light which inundates my hand is gold!\nThese same atoms dilated in accordance with a certain law need only be\ncondensed in accordance with another law. How is it to be done?\nSome have fancied by burying a ray of sunlight, Averro\u00c3\u00abs,--yes, 'tis\nAverro\u00c3\u00abs,--Averro\u00c3\u00abs buried one under the first pillar on the left of the\nsanctuary of the Koran, in the great Mahometan mosque of Cordova; but\nthe vault cannot be opened for the purpose of ascertaining whether the\noperation has succeeded, until after the lapse of eight thousand years.\n\n\"The devil!\" said Jehan, to himself, \"'tis a long while to wait for a\ncrown!\"\n\n\"Others have thought,\" continued the dreamy archdeacon, \"that it\nwould be better worth while to operate upon a ray of Sirius. But 'tis\nexceeding hard to obtain this ray pure, because of the simultaneous\npresence of other stars whose rays mingle with it. Flamel esteemed\nit more simple to operate upon terrestrial fire. Flamel! there's\npredestination in the name! _Flamma_! yes, fire. All lies there. The\ndiamond is contained in the carbon, gold is in the fire. But how to\nextract it? Magistri affirms that there are certain feminine names,\nwhich possess a charm so sweet and mysterious, that it suffices to\npronounce them during the operation. Let us read what Manon says on the\nmatter: 'Where women are honored, the divinities are rejoiced; where\nthey are despised, it is useless to pray to God. The mouth of a woman\nis constantly pure; it is a running water, it is a ray of sunlight. The\nname of a woman should be agreeable, sweet, fanciful; it should end in\nlong vowels, and resemble words of benediction.' Yes, the sage is right;\nin truth, Maria, Sophia, la Esmeral--Damnation! always that thought!\"\n\nAnd he closed the book violently.\n\nHe passed his hand over his brow, as though to brush away the idea which\nassailed him; then he took from the table a nail and a small hammer,\nwhose handle was curiously painted with cabalistic letters.\n\n\"For some time,\" he said with a bitter smile, \"I have failed in all my\nexperiments! one fixed idea possesses me, and sears my brain like fire.\nI have not even been able to discover the secret of Cassiodorus,\nwhose lamp burned without wick and without oil. A simple matter,\nnevertheless--\"\n\n\"The deuce!\" muttered Jehan in his beard.\n\n\"Hence,\" continued the priest, \"one wretched thought is sufficient to\nrender a man weak and beside himself! Oh! how Claude Pernelle would\nlaugh at me. She who could not turn Nicholas Flamel aside, for one\nmoment, from his pursuit of the great work! What! I hold in my hand the\nmagic hammer of Z\u00c3\u00a9chi\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9! at every blow dealt by the formidable rabbi,\nfrom the depths of his cell, upon this nail, that one of his enemies\nwhom he had condemned, were he a thousand leagues away, was buried a\ncubit deep in the earth which swallowed him. The King of France himself,\nin consequence of once having inconsiderately knocked at the door of the\nthermaturgist, sank to the knees through the pavement of his own Paris.\nThis took place three centuries ago. Well! I possess the hammer and the\nnail, and in my hands they are utensils no more formidable than a club\nin the hands of a maker of edge tools. And yet all that is required\nis to find the magic word which Z\u00c3\u00a9chi\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9 pronounced when he struck his\nnail.\"\n\n\"What nonsense!\" thought Jehan.\n\n\"Let us see, let us try!\" resumed the archdeacon briskly. \"Were I to\nsucceed, I should behold the blue spark flash from the head of the nail.\nEmen-H\u00c3\u00a9tan! Emen-H\u00c3\u00a9tan! That's not it. Sig\u00c3\u00a9ani! Sig\u00c3\u00a9ani! May this nail\nopen the tomb to any one who bears the name of Phoebus! A curse upon it!\nAlways and eternally the same idea!\"\n\nAnd he flung away the hammer in a rage. Then he sank down so deeply on\nthe arm-chair and the table, that Jehan lost him from view behind the\ngreat pile of manuscripts. For the space of several minutes, all that he\nsaw was his fist convulsively clenched on a book. Suddenly, Dom Claude\nsprang up, seized a compass and engraved in silence upon the wall in\ncapital letters, this Greek word\n\n         _ANANKE_.\n\n\"My brother is mad,\" said Jehan to himself; \"it would have been far more\nsimple to write _Fatum_, every one is not obliged to know Greek.\"\n\nThe archdeacon returned and seated himself in his armchair, and placed\nhis head on both his hands, as a sick man does, whose head is heavy and\nburning.\n\nThe student watched his brother with surprise. He did not know, he who\nwore his heart on his sleeve, he who observed only the good old law\nof Nature in the world, he who allowed his passions to follow their\ninclinations, and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry, so\nfreely did he let it off each day by fresh drains,--he did not know with\nwhat fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress\nis denied to it, how it accumulates, how it swells, how it overflows,\nhow it hollows out the heart; how it breaks in inward sobs, and dull\nconvulsions, until it has rent its dikes and burst its bed. The austere\nand glacial envelope of Claude Frollo, that cold surface of steep and\ninaccessible virtue, had always deceived Jehan. The merry scholar had\nnever dreamed that there was boiling lava, furious and profound, beneath\nthe snowy brow of AEtna.\n\nWe do not know whether he suddenly became conscious of these things;\nbut, giddy as he was, he understood that he had seen what he ought not\nto have seen, that he had just surprised the soul of his elder brother\nin one of its most secret altitudes, and that Claude must not be allowed\nto know it. Seeing that the archdeacon had fallen back into his former\nimmobility, he withdrew his head very softly, and made some noise with\nhis feet outside the door, like a person who has just arrived and is\ngiving warning of his approach.\n\n\"Enter!\" cried the archdeacon, from the interior of his cell; \"I\nwas expecting you. I left the door unlocked expressly; enter Master\nJacques!\"\n\nThe scholar entered boldly. The archdeacon, who was very much\nembarrassed by such a visit in such a place, trembled in his arm-chair.\n\"What! 'tis you, Jehan?\"\n\n\"'Tis a J, all the same,\" said the scholar, with his ruddy, merry, and\naudacious face.\n\nDom Claude's visage had resumed its severe expression.\n\n\"What are you come for?\"\n\n\"Brother,\" replied the scholar, making an effort to assume a decent,\npitiful, and modest mien, and twirling his cap in his hands with an\ninnocent air; \"I am come to ask of you--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"A little lecture on morality, of which I stand greatly in need,\" Jehan\ndid not dare to add aloud,--\"and a little money of which I am in still\ngreater need.\" This last member of his phrase remained unuttered.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the archdeacon, in a cold tone, \"I am greatly\ndispleased with you.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed the scholar.\n\nDom Claude made his arm-chair describe a quarter circle, and gazed\nintently at Jehan.\n\n\"I am very glad to see you.\"\n\nThis was a formidable exordium. Jehan braced himself for a rough\nencounter.\n\n\"Jehan, complaints are brought me about you every day. What affray was\nthat in which you bruised with a cudgel a little vicomte, Albert de\nRamonchamp?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Jehan, \"a vast thing that! A malicious page amused himself by\nsplashing the scholars, by making his horse gallop through the mire!\"\n\n\"Who,\" pursued the archdeacon, \"is that Mahiet Fargel, whose gown you\nhave torn? _Tunicam dechiraverunt_, saith the complaint.\"\n\n\"Ah bah! a wretched cap of a Montaigu! Isn't that it?\"\n\n\"The complaint says _tunicam_ and not _cappettam_. Do you know Latin?\"\n\nJehan did not reply.\n\n\"Yes,\" pursued the priest shaking his head, \"that is the state of\nlearning and letters at the present day. The Latin tongue is hardly\nunderstood, Syriac is unknown, Greek so odious that 'tis accounted no\nignorance in the most learned to skip a Greek word without reading it,\nand to say, '_Groecum est non legitur_.'\"\n\nThe scholar raised his eyes boldly. \"Monsieur my brother, doth it please\nyou that I shall explain in good French vernacular that Greek word which\nis written yonder on the wall?\"\n\n\"What word?\"\n\n\"'_ANANKE_.\"\n\nA slight flush spread over the cheeks of the priest with their high\nbones, like the puff of smoke which announces on the outside the secret\ncommotions of a volcano. The student hardly noticed it.\n\n\"Well, Jehan,\" stammered the elder brother with an effort, \"What is the\nmeaning of yonder word?\"\n\n\"FATE.\"\n\nDom Claude turned pale again, and the scholar pursued carelessly.\n\n\"And that word below it, graved by the same hand, '_Ay\u00c3\u00a1yvela_, signifies\n'impurity.' You see that people do know their Greek.\"\n\nAnd the archdeacon remained silent. This Greek lesson had rendered him\nthoughtful.\n\nMaster Jehan, who possessed all the artful ways of a spoiled child,\njudged that the moment was a favorable one in which to risk his request.\nAccordingly, he assumed an extremely soft tone and began,--\n\n\"My good brother, do you hate me to such a degree as to look savagely\nupon me because of a few mischievous cuffs and blows distributed in a\nfair war to a pack of lads and brats, _quibusdam marmosetis_? You see,\ngood Brother Claude, that people know their Latin.\"\n\nBut all this caressing hypocrisy did not have its usual effect on the\nsevere elder brother. Cerberus did not bite at the honey cake. The\narchdeacon's brow did not lose a single wrinkle.\n\n\"What are you driving at?\" he said dryly.\n\n\"Well, in point of fact, this!\" replied Jehan bravely, \"I stand in need\nof money.\"\n\nAt this audacious declaration, the archdeacon's visage assumed a\nthoroughly pedagogical and paternal expression.\n\n\"You know, Monsieur Jehan, that our fief of Tirechappe, putting the\ndirect taxes and the rents of the nine and twenty houses in a block,\nyields only nine and thirty livres, eleven sous, six deniers, Parisian.\nIt is one half more than in the time of the brothers Paclet, but it is\nnot much.\"\n\n\"I need money,\" said Jehan stoically.\n\n\"You know that the official has decided that our twenty-one houses\nshould he moved full into the fief of the Bishopric, and that we could\nredeem this homage only by paying the reverend bishop two marks of\nsilver gilt of the price of six livres parisis. Now, these two marks I\nhave not yet been able to get together. You know it.\"\n\n\"I know that I stand in need of money,\" repeated Jehan for the third\ntime.\n\n\"And what are you going to do with it?\"\n\nThis question caused a flash of hope to gleam before Jehan's eyes. He\nresumed his dainty, caressing air.\n\n\"Stay, dear Brother Claude, I should not come to you, with any evil\nmotive. There is no intention of cutting a dash in the taverns with your\nunzains, and of strutting about the streets of Paris in a caparison of\ngold brocade, with a lackey, _cum meo laquasio_. No, brother, 'tis for a\ngood work.\"\n\n\"What good work?\" demanded Claude, somewhat surprised.\n\n\"Two of my friends wish to purchase an outfit for the infant of a poor\nHaudriette widow. It is a charity. It will cost three forms, and I\nshould like to contribute to it.\"\n\n\"What are names of your two friends?\"\n\n\"Pierre l'Assommeur and Baptiste Croque-Oison*.\"\n\n\n     *  Peter the Slaughterer; and Baptist Crack-Gosling.\n\n\n\"Hum,\" said the archdeacon; \"those are names as fit for a good work as a\ncatapult for the chief altar.\"\n\nIt is certain that Jehan had made a very bad choice of names for his two\nfriends. He realized it too late.\n\n\"And then,\" pursued the sagacious Claude, \"what sort of an infant's\noutfit is it that is to cost three forms, and that for the child of a\nHaudriette? Since when have the Haudriette widows taken to having babes\nin swaddling-clothes?\"\n\nJehan broke the ice once more.\n\n\"Eh, well! yes! I need money in order to go and see Isabeau la Thierrye\nto-night; in the Val-d' Amour!\"\n\n\"Impure wretch!\" exclaimed the priest.\n\n\"_Avayveia_!\" said Jehan.\n\nThis quotation, which the scholar borrowed with malice, perchance, from\nthe wall of the cell, produced a singular effect on the archdeacon. He\nbit his lips and his wrath was drowned in a crimson flush.\n\n\"Begone,\" he said to Jehan. \"I am expecting some one.\"\n\nThe scholar made one more effort.\n\n\"Brother Claude, give me at least one little parisis to buy something to\neat.\"\n\n\"How far have you gone in the Decretals of Gratian?\" demanded Dom\nClaude.\n\n\"I have lost my copy books.\n\n\"Where are you in your Latin humanities?\"\n\n\"My copy of Horace has been stolen.\"\n\n\"Where are you in Aristotle?\"\n\n\"I' faith! brother what father of the church is it, who says that the\nerrors of heretics have always had for their lurking place the thickets\nof Aristotle's metaphysics? A plague on Aristotle! I care not to tear my\nreligion on his metaphysics.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" resumed the archdeacon, \"at the king's last entry, there\nwas a young gentleman, named Philippe de Comines, who wore embroidered\non the housings of his horse this device, upon which I counsel you to\nmeditate: _Qui non laborat, non manducet_.\"\n\nThe scholar remained silent for a moment, with his finger in his ear,\nhis eyes on the ground, and a discomfited mien.\n\nAll at once he turned round to Claude with the agile quickness of a\nwagtail.\n\n\"So, my good brother, you refuse me a sou parisis, wherewith to buy a\ncrust at a baker's shop?\"\n\n\"_Qui non laborat, non manducet_.\"\n\nAt this response of the inflexible archdeacon, Jehan hid his head in\nhis hands, like a woman sobbing, and exclaimed with an expression of\ndespair: \"_Orororororoi_.\"\n\n\"What is the meaning of this, sir?\" demanded Claude, surprised at this\nfreak.\n\n\"What indeed!\" said the scholar; and he lifted to Claude his impudent\neyes into which he had just thrust his fists in order to communicate to\nthem the redness of tears; \"'tis Greek! 'tis an anapaest of AEschylus\nwhich expresses grief perfectly.\"\n\nAnd here he burst into a laugh so droll and violent that it made the\narchdeacon smile. It was Claude's fault, in fact: why had he so spoiled\nthat child?\n\n\"Oh! good Brother Claude,\" resumed Jehan, emboldened by this smile,\n\"look at my worn out boots. Is there a cothurnus in the world more\ntragic than these boots, whose soles are hanging out their tongues?\"\n\nThe archdeacon promptly returned to his original severity.\n\n\"I will send you some new boots, but no money.\"\n\n\"Only a poor little parisis, brother,\" continued the suppliant Jehan. \"I\nwill learn Gratian by heart, I will believe firmly in God, I will be\na regular Pythagoras of science and virtue. But one little parisis, in\nmercy! Would you have famine bite me with its jaws which are gaping in\nfront of me, blacker, deeper, and more noisome than a Tartarus or the\nnose of a monk?\"\n\nDom Claude shook his wrinkled head: \"_Qui non laborat_--\"\n\nJehan did not allow him to finish.\n\n\"Well,\" he exclaimed, \"to the devil then! Long live joy! I will live in\nthe tavern, I will fight, I will break pots and I will go and see the\nwenches.\" And thereupon, he hurled his cap at the wall, and snapped his\nfingers like castanets.\n\nThe archdeacon surveyed him with a gloomy air.\n\n\"Jehan, you have no soul.\"\n\n\"In that case, according to Epicurius, I lack a something made of\nanother something which has no name.\"\n\n\"Jehan, you must think seriously of amending your ways.\"\n\n\"Oh, come now,\" cried the student, gazing in turn at his brother and the\nalembics on the furnace, \"everything is preposterous here, both ideas\nand bottles!\"\n\n\"Jehan, you are on a very slippery downward road. Do you know whither\nyou are going?\"\n\n\"To the wine-shop,\" said Jehan.\n\n\"The wine-shop leads to the pillory.\"\n\n\"'Tis as good a lantern as any other, and perchance with that one,\nDiogenes would have found his man.\"\n\n\"The pillory leads to the gallows.\"\n\n\"The gallows is a balance which has a man at one end and the whole earth\nat the other. 'Tis fine to be the man.\"\n\n\"The gallows leads to hell.\"\n\n\"'Tis a big fire.\".\n\n\"Jehan, Jehan, the end will be bad.\"\n\n\"The beginning will have been good.\"\n\nAt that moment, the sound of a footstep was heard on the staircase.\n\n\"Silence!\" said the archdeacon, laying his finger on his mouth, \"here is\nMaster Jacques. Listen, Jehan,\" he added, in a low voice; \"have a care\nnever to speak of what you shall have seen or heard here. Hide yourself\nquickly under the furnace, and do not breathe.\"\n\nThe scholar concealed himself; just then a happy idea occurred to him.\n\n\"By the way, Brother Claude, a form for not breathing.\"\n\n\"Silence! I promise.\"\n\n\"You must give it to me.\"\n\n\"Take it, then!\" said the archdeacon angrily, flinging his purse at him.\n\nJehan darted under the furnace again, and the door opened.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE TWO MEN CLOTHED IN BLACK.\n\n\n\nThe personage who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy mien. The first\npoint which struck the eye of our Jehan (who, as the reader will readily\nsurmise, had ensconced himself in his nook in such a manner as to enable\nhim to see and hear everything at his good pleasure) was the perfect\nsadness of the garments and the visage of this new-corner. There was,\nnevertheless, some sweetness diffused over that face, but it was the\nsweetness of a cat or a judge, an affected, treacherous sweetness. He\nwas very gray and wrinkled, and not far from his sixtieth year, his\neyes blinked, his eyebrows were white, his lip pendulous, and his hands\nlarge. When Jehan saw that it was only this, that is to say, no doubt\na physician or a magistrate, and that this man had a nose very far from\nhis mouth, a sign of stupidity, he nestled down in his hole, in despair\nat being obliged to pass an indefinite time in such an uncomfortable\nattitude, and in such bad company.\n\nThe archdeacon, in the meantime, had not even risen to receive this\npersonage. He had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near\nthe door, and, after several moments of a silence which appeared to be\na continuation of a preceding meditation, he said to him in a rather\npatronizing way, \"Good day, Master Jacques.\"\n\n\"Greeting, master,\" replied the man in black.\n\nThere was in the two ways in which \"Master Jacques\" was pronounced\non the one hand, and the \"master\" by preeminence on the other, the\ndifference between monseigneur and monsieur, between _domine_ and\n_domne_. It was evidently the meeting of a teacher and a disciple.\n\n\"Well!\" resumed the archdeacon, after a fresh silence which Master\nJacques took good care not to disturb, \"how are you succeeding?\"\n\n\"Alas! master,\" said the other, with a sad smile, \"I am still seeking\nthe stone. Plenty of ashes. But not a spark of gold.\"\n\nDom Claude made a gesture of impatience. \"I am not talking to you of\nthat, Master Jacques Charmolue, but of the trial of your magician. Is it\nnot Marc Cenaine that you call him? the butler of the Court of Accounts?\nDoes he confess his witchcraft? Have you been successful with the\ntorture?\"\n\n\"Alas! no,\" replied Master Jacques, still with his sad smile; \"we have\nnot that consolation. That man is a stone. We might have him boiled in\nthe March\u00c3\u00a9 aux Pourceaux, before he would say anything. Nevertheless, we\nare sparing nothing for the sake of getting at the truth; he is already\nthoroughly dislocated, we are applying all the herbs of Saint John's\nday; as saith the old comedian Plautus,--\n\n\n        _'Advorsum stimulos, laminas, crucesque, compedesque,\n        Nerros, catenas, carceres, numellas, pedicas, boias_.'\n\n\nNothing answers; that man is terrible. I am at my wit's end over him.\"\n\n\"You have found nothing new in his house?\"\n\n\"I' faith, yes,\" said Master Jacques, fumbling in his pouch; \"this\nparchment. There are words in it which we cannot comprehend. The\ncriminal advocate, Monsieur Philippe Lheulier, nevertheless, knows a\nlittle Hebrew, which he learned in that matter of the Jews of the Rue\nKantersten, at Brussels.\"\n\nSo saying, Master Jacques unrolled a parchment. \"Give it here,\" said the\narchdeacon. And casting his eyes upon this writing: \"Pure magic, Master\nJacques!\" he exclaimed. \"'Emen-H\u00c3\u00a9tan!' 'Tis the cry of the vampires\nwhen they arrive at the witches' sabbath. _Per ipsum, et cum ipso, et in\nipso_! 'Tis the command which chains the devil in hell. _Hax, pax, max_!\nthat refers to medicine. A formula against the bite of mad dogs. Master\nJacques! you are procurator to the king in the Ecclesiastical Courts:\nthis parchment is abominable.\"\n\n\"We will put the man to the torture once more. Here again,\" added Master\nJacques, fumbling afresh in his pouch, \"is something that we have found\nat Marc Cenaine's house.\"\n\nIt was a vessel belonging to the same family as those which covered Dom\nClaude's furnace.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the archdeacon, \"a crucible for alchemy.\"\n\n\"I will confess to you,\" continued Master Jacques, with his timid\nand awkward smile, \"that I have tried it over the furnace, but I have\nsucceeded no better than with my own.\"\n\nThe archdeacon began an examination of the vessel. \"What has he engraved\non his crucible? _Och! och_! the word which expels fleas! That Marc\nCenaine is an ignoramus! I verily believe that you will never make gold\nwith this! 'Tis good to set in your bedroom in summer and that is all!\"\n\n\"Since we are talking about errors,\" said the king's procurator, \"I\nhave just been studying the figures on the portal below before ascending\nhither; is your reverence quite sure that the opening of the work of\nphysics is there portrayed on the side towards the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-Dieu, and that\namong the seven nude figures which stand at the feet of Notre-Dame, that\nwhich has wings on his heels is Mercurius?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the priest; \"'tis Augustin Nypho who writes it, that\nItalian doctor who had a bearded demon who acquainted him with all\nthings. However, we will descend, and I will explain it to you with the\ntext before us.\"\n\n\"Thanks, master,\" said Charmolue, bowing to the earth. \"By the way, I\nwas on the point of forgetting. When doth it please you that I shall\napprehend the little sorceress?\"\n\n\"What sorceress?\"\n\n\"That gypsy girl you know, who comes every day to dance on the church\nsquare, in spite of the official's prohibition! She hath a demoniac\ngoat with horns of the devil, which reads, which writes, which knows\nmathematics like Picatrix, and which would suffice to hang all Bohemia.\nThe prosecution is all ready; 'twill soon be finished, I assure you! A\npretty creature, on my soul, that dancer! The handsomest black eyes! Two\nEgyptian carbuncles! When shall we begin?\"\n\nThe archdeacon was excessively pale.\n\n\"I will tell you that hereafter,\" he stammered, in a voice that was\nbarely articulate; then he resumed with an effort, \"Busy yourself with\nMarc Cenaine.\"\n\n\"Be at ease,\" said Charmolue with a smile; \"I'll buckle him down again\nfor you on the leather bed when I get home. But 'tis a devil of a man;\nhe wearies even Pierrat Torterue himself, who hath hands larger than my\nown. As that good Plautus saith,--\n\n\n         '_Nudus vinctus, centum pondo,\n          es quando pendes per pedes_.'\n\n\nThe torture of the wheel and axle! 'Tis the most effectual! He shall\ntaste it!\"\n\nDom Claude seemed absorbed in gloomy abstraction. He turned to\nCharmolue,--\n\n\"Master Pierrat--Master Jacques, I mean, busy yourself with Marc\nCenaine.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, Dom Claude. Poor man! he will have suffered like Mummol.\nWhat an idea to go to the witches' sabbath! a butler of the Court of\nAccounts, who ought to know Charlemagne's text; _Stryga vel masea_!--In\nthe matter of the little girl,--Smelarda, as they call her,--I will\nawait your orders. Ah! as we pass through the portal, you will explain\nto me also the meaning of the gardener painted in relief, which one sees\nas one enters the church. Is it not the Sower? H\u00c3\u00a9! master, of what are\nyou thinking, pray?\"\n\nDom Claude, buried in his own thoughts, no longer listened to him.\nCharmolue, following the direction of his glance, perceived that it was\nfixed mechanically on the great spider's web which draped the window.\nAt that moment, a bewildered fly which was seeking the March sun, flung\nitself through the net and became entangled there. On the agitation of\nhis web, the enormous spider made an abrupt move from his central cell,\nthen with one bound, rushed upon the fly, which he folded together with\nhis fore antennae, while his hideous proboscis dug into the victim's\nbead. \"Poor fly!\" said the king's procurator in the ecclesiastical\ncourt; and he raised his hand to save it. The archdeacon, as though\nroused with a start, withheld his arm with convulsive violence.\n\n\"Master Jacques,\" he cried, \"let fate take its course!\" The procurator\nwheeled round in affright; it seemed to him that pincers of iron had\nclutched his arm. The priest's eye was staring, wild, flaming, and\nremained riveted on the horrible little group of the spider and the fly.\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" continued the priest, in a voice which seemed to proceed from\nthe depths of his being, \"behold here a symbol of all. She flies, she is\njoyous, she is just born; she seeks the spring, the open air, liberty:\noh, yes! but let her come in contact with the fatal network, and\nthe spider issues from it, the hideous spider! Poor dancer! poor,\npredestined fly! Let things take their course, Master Jacques, 'tis\nfate! Alas! Claude, thou art the spider! Claude, thou art the fly also!\nThou wert flying towards learning, light, the sun. Thou hadst no other\ncare than to reach the open air, the full daylight of eternal truth; but\nin precipitating thyself towards the dazzling window which opens upon\nthe other world,--upon the world of brightness, intelligence, and\nscience--blind fly! senseless, learned man! thou hast not perceived\nthat subtle spider's web, stretched by destiny betwixt the light\nand thee--thou hast flung thyself headlong into it, and now thou art\nstruggling with head broken and mangled wings between the iron antennae\nof fate! Master Jacques! Master Jacques! let the spider work its will!\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" said Charmolue, who was gazing at him without\ncomprehending him, \"that I will not touch it. But release my arm,\nmaster, for pity's sake! You have a hand like a pair of pincers.\"\n\nThe archdeacon did not hear him. \"Oh, madman!\" he went on, without\nremoving his gaze from the window. \"And even couldst thou have broken\nthrough that formidable web, with thy gnat's wings, thou believest that\nthou couldst have reached the light? Alas! that pane of glass which is\nfurther on, that transparent obstacle, that wall of crystal, harder than\nbrass, which separates all philosophies from the truth, how wouldst thou\nhave overcome it? Oh, vanity of science! how many wise men come flying\nfrom afar, to dash their heads against thee! How many systems vainly\nfling themselves buzzing against that eternal pane!\"\n\nHe became silent. These last ideas, which had gradually led him back\nfrom himself to science, appeared to have calmed him. Jacques Charmolue\nrecalled him wholly to a sense of reality by addressing to him this\nquestion: \"Come, now, master, when will you come to aid me in making\ngold? I am impatient to succeed.\"\n\nThe archdeacon shook his head, with a bitter smile. \"Master Jacques read\nMichel Psellus' '_Dialogus de Energia et Operatione Daemonum_.' What we\nare doing is not wholly innocent.\"\n\n\"Speak lower, master! I have my suspicions of it,\" said Jacques\nCharmolue. \"But one must practise a bit of hermetic science when one\nis only procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, at thirty\ncrowns tournois a year. Only speak low.\"\n\nAt that moment the sound of jaws in the act of mastication, which\nproceeded from beneath the furnace, struck Charmolue's uneasy ear.\n\n\"What's that?\" he inquired.\n\nIt was the scholar, who, ill at ease, and greatly bored in his\nhiding-place, had succeeded in discovering there a stale crust and a\ntriangle of mouldy cheese, and had set to devouring the whole without\nceremony, by way of consolation and breakfast. As he was very hungry,\nhe made a great deal of noise, and he accented each mouthful strongly,\nwhich startled and alarmed the procurator.\n\n\"'Tis a cat of mine,\" said the archdeacon, quickly, \"who is regaling\nherself under there with a mouse.\"\n\nThis explanation satisfied Charmolue.\n\n\"In fact, master,\" he replied, with a respectful smile, \"all great\nphilosophers have their familiar animal. You know what Servius saith:\n'_Nullus enim locus sine genio est_,--for there is no place that hath\nnot its spirit.'\"\n\nBut Dom Claude, who stood in terror of some new freak on the part of\nJehan, reminded his worthy disciple that they had some figures on\nthe fa\u00c3\u00a7ade to study together, and the two quitted the cell, to the\naccompaniment of a great \"ouf!\" from the scholar, who began to seriously\nfear that his knee would acquire the imprint of his chin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THE EFFECT WHICH SEVEN OATHS IN THE OPEN AIR CAN PRODUCE.\n\n\n\n\"_Te Deum Laudamus_!\" exclaimed Master Jehan, creeping out from his\nhole, \"the screech-owls have departed. Och! och! Hax! pax! max! fleas!\nmad dogs! the devil! I have had enough of their conversation! My head\nis humming like a bell tower. And mouldy cheese to boot! Come on! Let us\ndescend, take the big brother's purse and convert all these coins into\nbottles!\"\n\nHe cast a glance of tenderness and admiration into the interior of the\nprecious pouch, readjusted his toilet, rubbed up his boots, dusted his\npoor half sleeves, all gray with ashes, whistled an air, indulged in a\nsportive pirouette, looked about to see whether there were not something\nmore in the cell to take, gathered up here and there on the furnace some\namulet in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket,\non Isabeau la Thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother\nhad left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his\nturn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular\nstaircase, skipping like a bird.\n\nIn the midst of the gloom of the spiral staircase, he elbowed something\nwhich drew aside with a growl; he took it for granted that it was\nQuasimodo, and it struck him as so droll that he descended the remainder\nof the staircase holding his sides with laughter. On emerging upon the\nPlace, he laughed yet more heartily.\n\nHe stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again.\n\"Oh!\" said he, \"good and honorable pavement of Paris, cursed staircase,\nfit to put the angels of Jacob's ladder out of breath! What was I\nthinking of to thrust myself into that stone gimlet which pierces the\nsky; all for the sake of eating bearded cheese, and looking at the\nbell-towers of Paris through a hole in the wall!\"\n\nHe advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls,\nthat is to say, Dom Claude and Master Jacques Charmolue, absorbed in\ncontemplation before a carving on the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. He approached them on\ntiptoe, and heard the archdeacon say in a low tone to Charmolue: \"'Twas\nGuillaume de Paris who caused a Job to be carved upon this stone of\nthe hue of lapis-lazuli, gilded on the edges. Job represents the\nphilosopher's stone, which must also be tried and martyrized in order\nto become perfect, as saith Raymond Lulle: _Sub conservatione formoe\nspeciftoe salva anima_.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference to me,\" said Jehan, \"'tis I who have the\npurse.\"\n\nAt that moment he heard a powerful and sonorous voice articulate behind\nhim a formidable series of oaths. \"_Sang Dieu! Ventre-.Dieu! B\u00c3\u00a9dieu!\nCorps de Dieu! Nombril de Belzebuth! Nom d'un pape! Come et tonnerre_.\"\n\n\"Upon my soul!\" exclaimed Jehan, \"that can only be my friend, Captain\nPhoebus!\"\n\nThis name of Phoebus reached the ears of the archdeacon at the moment\nwhen he was explaining to the king's procurator the dragon which is\nhiding its tail in a bath, from which issue smoke and the head of\na king. Dom Claude started, interrupted himself and, to the great\namazement of Charmolue, turned round and beheld his brother Jehan\naccosting a tall officer at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.\n\nIt was, in fact, Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers. He was backed up\nagainst a corner of the house of his betrothed and swearing like a\nheathen.\n\n\"By my faith! Captain Phoebus,\" said Jehan, taking him by the hand, \"you\nare cursing with admirable vigor.\"\n\n\"Horns and thunder!\" replied the captain.\n\n\"Horns and thunder yourself!\" replied the student. \"Come now, fair\ncaptain, whence comes this overflow of fine words?\"\n\n\"Pardon me, good comrade Jehan,\" exclaimed Phoebus, shaking his hand, \"a\nhorse going at a gallop cannot halt short. Now, I was swearing at a hard\ngallop. I have just been with those prudes, and when I come forth, I\nalways find my throat full of curses, I must spit them out or strangle,\n_ventre et tonnerre_!\"\n\n\"Will you come and drink?\" asked the scholar.\n\nThis proposition calmed the captain.\n\n\"I'm willing, but I have no money.\"\n\n\"But I have!\"\n\n\"Bah! let's see it!\"\n\nJehan spread out the purse before the captain's eyes, with dignity and\nsimplicity. Meanwhile, the archdeacon, who had abandoned the dumbfounded\nCharmolue where he stood, had approached them and halted a few paces\ndistant, watching them without their noticing him, so deeply were they\nabsorbed in contemplation of the purse.\n\nPhoebus exclaimed: \"A purse in your pocket, Jehan! 'tis the moon in a\nbucket of water, one sees it there but 'tis not there. There is nothing\nbut its shadow. Pardieu! let us wager that these are pebbles!\"\n\nJehan replied coldly: \"Here are the pebbles wherewith I pave my fob!\"\n\nAnd without adding another word, he emptied the purse on a neighboring\npost, with the air of a Roman saving his country.\n\n\"True God!\" muttered Phoebus, \"targes, big-blanks, little blanks,\nmailles,* every two worth one of Tournay, farthings of Paris, real eagle\nliards! 'Tis dazzling!\"\n\n\n     *  An ancient copper coin, the forty-fourth part of a sou or\nthe twelfth part of a farthing.\n\n\nJehan remained dignified and immovable. Several liards had rolled into\nthe mud; the captain in his enthusiasm stooped to pick them up. Jehan\nrestrained him.\n\n\"Fye, Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers!\"\n\nPhoebus counted the coins, and turning towards Jehan with solemnity, \"Do\nyou know, Jehan, that there are three and twenty sous parisis! whom have\nyou plundered to-night, in the Street Cut-Weazand?\"\n\nJehan flung back his blonde and curly head, and said, half-closing his\neyes disdainfully,--\n\n\"We have a brother who is an archdeacon and a fool.\"\n\n\"_Corne de Dieu_!\" exclaimed Phoebus, \"the worthy man!\"\n\n\"Let us go and drink,\" said Jehan.\n\n\"Where shall we go?\" said Phoebus; \"'To Eve's Apple.'\"\n\n\"No, captain, to 'Ancient Science.' An old woman sawing a basket\nhandle*; 'tis a rebus, and I like that.\"\n\n\n     * _Une vielle qui scie une anse_.\n\n\n\"A plague on rebuses, Jehan! the wine is better at 'Eve's Apple'; and\nthen, beside the door there is a vine in the sun which cheers me while I\nam drinking.\"\n\n\"Well! here goes for Eve and her apple,\" said the student, and taking\nPhoebus's arm. \"By the way, my dear captain, you just mentioned the Rue\nCoupe-Gueule* That is a very bad form of speech; people are no longer so\nbarbarous. They say, Coupe-Gorge**.\"\n\n\n     *  Cut-Weazand Street.\n\n     ** Cut-Throat Street.\n\n\nThe two friends set out towards \"Eve's Apple.\" It is unnecessary\nto mention that they had first gathered up the money, and that the\narchdeacon followed them.\n\nThe archdeacon followed them, gloomy and haggard. Was this the Phoebus\nwhose accursed name had been mingled with all his thoughts ever since\nhis interview with Gringoire? He did not know it, but it was at least a\nPhoebus, and that magic name sufficed to make the archdeacon follow the\ntwo heedless comrades with the stealthy tread of a wolf, listening\nto their words and observing their slightest gestures with anxious\nattention. Moreover, nothing was easier than to hear everything they\nsaid, as they talked loudly, not in the least concerned that the\npassers-by were taken into their confidence. They talked of duels,\nwenches, wine pots, and folly.\n\nAt the turning of a street, the sound of a tambourine reached them from\na neighboring square. Dom Claude heard the officer say to the scholar,--\n\n\"Thunder! Let us hasten our steps!\"\n\n\n\"Why, Phoebus?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid lest the Bohemian should see me.\"\n\n\"What Bohemian?\"\n\n\"The little girl with the goat.\"\n\n\"La Smeralda?\"\n\n\"That's it, Jehan. I always forget her devil of a name. Let us make\nhaste, she will recognize me. I don't want to have that girl accost me\nin the street.\"\n\n\"Do you know her, Phoebus?\"\n\nHere the archdeacon saw Phoebus sneer, bend down to Jehan's ear, and say\na few words to him in a low voice; then Phoebus burst into a laugh, and\nshook his head with a triumphant air.\n\n\"Truly?\" said Jehan.\n\n\"Upon my soul!\" said Phoebus.\n\n\"This evening?\"\n\n\"This evening.\"\n\n\"Are you sure that she will come?\"\n\n\"Are you a fool, Jehan? Does one doubt such things?\"\n\n\"Captain Phoebus, you are a happy gendarme!\"\n\nThe archdeacon heard the whole of this conversation. His teeth\nchattered; a visible shiver ran through his whole body. He halted for a\nmoment, leaned against a post like a drunken man, then followed the two\nmerry knaves.\n\nAt the moment when he overtook them once more, they had changed their\nconversation. He heard them singing at the top of their lungs the\nancient refrain,--\n\n\n         _Les enfants des Petits-Carreaux\n         Se font pendre cornme des veaux_*.\n\n\n     * The children of the Petits Carreaux let themselves be hung\nlike calves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. THE MYSTERIOUS MONK.\n\n\n\nThe illustrious wine shop of \"Eve's Apple\" was situated in the\nUniversity, at the corner of the Rue de la Rondelle and the Rue de la\nB\u00c3\u00a2tonnier. It was a very spacious and very low hail on the ground floor,\nwith a vaulted ceiling whose central spring rested upon a huge pillar of\nwood painted yellow; tables everywhere, shining pewter jugs hanging on\nthe walls, always a large number of drinkers, a plenty of wenches, a\nwindow on the street, a vine at the door, and over the door a flaring\npiece of sheet-iron, painted with an apple and a woman, rusted by\nthe rain and turning with the wind on an iron pin. This species of\nweather-vane which looked upon the pavement was the signboard.\n\nNight was falling; the square was dark; the wine-shop, full of candles,\nflamed afar like a forge in the gloom; the noise of glasses and\nfeasting, of oaths and quarrels, which escaped through the broken panes,\nwas audible. Through the mist which the warmth of the room spread over\nthe window in front, a hundred confused figures could be seen swarming,\nand from time to time a burst of noisy laughter broke forth from it.\nThe passers-by who were going about their business, slipped past this\ntumultuous window without glancing at it. Only at intervals did some\nlittle ragged boy raise himself on tiptoe as far as the ledge, and hurl\ninto the drinking-shop, that ancient, jeering hoot, with which drunken\nmen were then pursued: \"Aux Houls, saouls, saouls, saouls!\"\n\nNevertheless, one man paced imperturbably back and forth in front of the\ntavern, gazing at it incessantly, and going no further from it than a\npikernan from his sentry-box. He was enveloped in a mantle to his very\nnose. This mantle he had just purchased of the old-clothes man, in the\nvicinity of the \"Eve's Apple,\" no doubt to protect himself from the cold\nof the March evening, possibly also, to conceal his costume. From time\nto time he paused in front of the dim window with its leaden lattice,\nlistened, looked, and stamped his foot.\n\nAt length the door of the dram-shop opened. This was what he appeared to\nbe waiting for. Two boon companions came forth. The ray of light which\nescaped from the door crimsoned for a moment their jovial faces.\n\nThe man in the mantle went and stationed himself on the watch under a\nporch on the other side of the street.\n\n\"_Corne et tonnerre_!\" said one of the comrades. \"Seven o'clock is on\nthe point of striking. 'Tis the hour of my appointed meeting.\"\n\n\"I tell you,\" repeated his companion, with a thick tongue, \"that I don't\nlive in the Rue des Mauvaises Paroles, _indignus qui inter mala verba\nhabitat_. I have a lodging in the Rue Jean-Pain-Mollet, _in vico\nJohannis Pain-Mollet_. You are more horned than a unicorn if you assert\nthe contrary. Every one knows that he who once mounts astride a bear\nis never after afraid; but you have a nose turned to dainties like\nSaint-Jacques of the hospital.\"\n\n\"Jehan, my friend, you are drunk,\" said the other.\n\nThe other replied staggering, \"It pleases you to say so, Phoebus; but it\nhath been proved that Plato had the profile of a hound.\"\n\nThe reader has, no doubt, already recognized our two brave friends, the\ncaptain and the scholar. It appears that the man who was lying in\nwait for them had also recognized them, for he slowly followed all the\nzigzags that the scholar caused the captain to make, who being a more\nhardened drinker had retained all his self-possession. By listening to\nthem attentively, the man in the mantle could catch in its entirety the\nfollowing interesting conversation,--\n\n\"_Corbacque_! Do try to walk straight, master bachelor; you know that I\nmust leave you. Here it is seven o'clock. I have an appointment with a\nwoman.\"\n\n\"Leave me then! I see stars and lances of fire. You are like the Chateau\nde Dampmartin, which is bursting with laughter.\"\n\n\"By the warts of my grandmother, Jehan, you are raving with too much\nrabidness. By the way, Jehan, have you any money left?\"\n\n\"Monsieur Rector, there is no mistake; the little butcher's shop, _parva\nboucheria_.\"\n\n\"Jehau! my friend Jehan! You know that I made an appointment with that\nlittle girl at the end of the Pont Saint-Michel, and I can only take her\nto the Falourdel's, the old crone of the bridge, and that I must pay\nfor a chamber. The old witch with a white moustache would not trust me.\nJehan! for pity's sake! Have we drunk up the whole of the cur\u00c3\u00a9's purse?\nHave you not a single parisis left?\"\n\n\"The consciousness of having spent the other hours well is a just and\nsavory condiment for the table.\"\n\n\"Belly and guts! a truce to your whimsical nonsense! Tell me, Jehan of\nthe devil! have you any money left? Give it to me, _b\u00c3\u00a9dieu_! or I will\nsearch you, were you as leprous as Job, and as scabby as Caesar!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, the Rue Galiache is a street which hath at one end the Rue de\nla Verrerie, and at the other the Rue de la Tixeranderie.\"\n\n\"Well, yes! my good friend Jehan, my poor comrade, the Rue Galiache is\ngood, very good. But in the name of heaven collect your wits. I must\nhave a sou parisis, and the appointment is for seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"Silence for the rondo, and attention to the refrain,--\n\n\n         \"_Quand les rats mangeront les cas,\n         Le roi sera seigneur d'Arras;\n         Quand la mer, qui est grande et le(e\n         Sera a la Saint-Jean gele(e,\n         On verra, par-dessus la glace,\n         Sortir ceux d'Arras de leur place_*.\"\n\n\n     *  When the rats eat the cats, the king will be lord of Arras;\nwhen the sea which is great and wide, is frozen over at St. John's tide,\nmen will see across the ice, those who dwell in Arras quit their place.\n\n\n\"Well, scholar of Antichrist, may you be strangled with the entrails of\nyour mother!\" exclaimed Phoebus, and he gave the drunken scholar a rough\npush; the latter slipped against the wall, and slid flabbily to the\npavement of Philip Augustus. A remnant of fraternal pity, which never\nabandons the heart of a drinker, prompted Phoebus to roll Jehan with his\nfoot upon one of those pillows of the poor, which Providence keeps in\nreadiness at the corner of all the street posts of Paris, and which\nthe rich blight with the name of \"a rubbish-heap.\" The captain adjusted\nJehan's head upon an inclined plane of cabbage-stumps, and on the very\ninstant, the scholar fell to snoring in a magnificent bass. Meanwhile,\nall malice was not extinguished in the captain's heart. \"So much the\nworse if the devil's cart picks you up on its passage!\" he said to the\npoor, sleeping clerk; and he strode off.\n\nThe man in the mantle, who had not ceased to follow him, halted for a\nmoment before the prostrate scholar, as though agitated by indecision;\nthen, uttering a profound sigh, he also strode off in pursuit of the\ncaptain.\n\nWe, like them, will leave Jehan to slumber beneath the open sky, and\nwill follow them also, if it pleases the reader.\n\nOn emerging into the Rue Saint-Andr\u00c3\u00a9-des-Arcs, Captain Phoebus perceived\nthat some one was following him. On glancing sideways by chance, he\nperceived a sort of shadow crawling after him along the walls. He\nhalted, it halted; he resumed his march, it resumed its march. This\ndisturbed him not overmuch. \"Ah, bah!\" he said to himself, \"I have not a\nsou.\"\n\nHe paused in front of the College d'Autun. It was at this college that\nhe had sketched out what he called his studies, and, through a scholar's\nteasing habit which still lingered in him, he never passed the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade\nwithout inflicting on the statue of Cardinal Pierre Bertrand, sculptured\nto the right of the portal, the affront of which Priapus complains so\nbitterly in the satire of Horace, _Olim truncus eram ficulnus_. He\nhad done this with so much unrelenting animosity that the inscription,\n_Eduensis episcopus_, had become almost effaced. Therefore, he halted\nbefore the statue according to his wont. The street was utterly\ndeserted. At the moment when he was coolly retying his shoulder knots,\nwith his nose in the air, he saw the shadow approaching him with slow\nsteps, so slow that he had ample time to observe that this shadow wore\na cloak and a hat. On arriving near him, it halted and remained more\nmotionless than the statue of Cardinal Bertrand. Meanwhile, it riveted\nupon Phoebus two intent eyes, full of that vague light which issues in\nthe night time from the pupils of a cat.\n\nThe captain was brave, and would have cared very little for a\nhighwayman, with a rapier in his hand. But this walking statue, this\npetrified man, froze his blood. There were then in circulation, strange\nstories of a surly monk, a nocturnal prowler about the streets of Paris,\nand they recurred confusedly to his memory. He remained for several\nminutes in stupefaction, and finally broke the silence with a forced\nlaugh.\n\n\"Monsieur, if you are a robber, as I hope you are, you produce upon me\nthe effect of a heron attacking a nutshell. I am the son of a ruined\nfamily, my dear fellow. Try your hand near by here. In the chapel of\nthis college there is some wood of the true cross set in silver.\"\n\nThe hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its mantle and descended\nupon the arm of Phoebus with the grip of an eagle's talon; at the same\ntime the shadow spoke,--\n\n\"Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers!\"\n\n\"What, the devil!\" said Phoebus, \"you know my name!\"\n\n\"I know not your name alone,\" continued the man in the mantle, with his\nsepulchral voice. \"You have a rendezvous this evening.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Phoebus in amazement.\n\n\"At seven o'clock.\"\n\n\"In a quarter of an hour.\"\n\n\"At la Falourdel's.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\"\n\n\"The lewd hag of the Pont Saint-Michel.\"\n\n\"Of Saint Michel the archangel, as the Pater Noster saith.\"\n\n\"Impious wretch!\" muttered the spectre. \"With a woman?\"\n\n\"_Confiteor_,--I confess--.\"\n\n\"Who is called--?\"\n\n\"La Smeralda,\" said Phoebus, gayly. All his heedlessness had gradually\nreturned.\n\nAt this name, the shadow's grasp shook the arm of Phoebus in a fury.\n\n\"Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers, thou liest!\"\n\nAny one who could have beheld at that moment the captain's inflamed\ncountenance, his leap backwards, so violent that he disengaged himself\nfrom the grip which held him, the proud air with which he clapped his\nhand on his swordhilt, and, in the presence of this wrath the gloomy\nimmobility of the man in the cloak,--any one who could have beheld this\nwould have been frightened. There was in it a touch of the combat of Don\nJuan and the statue.\n\n\"Christ and Satan!\" exclaimed the captain. \"That is a word which rarely\nstrikes the ear of a Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers! Thou wilt not dare repeat it.\"\n\n\"Thou liest!\" said the shadow coldly.\n\nThe captain gnashed his teeth. Surly monk, phantom, superstitions,--he\nhad forgotten all at that moment. He no longer beheld anything but a\nman, and an insult.\n\n\"Ah! this is well!\" he stammered, in a voice stifled with rage. He\ndrew his sword, then stammering, for anger as well as fear makes a\nman tremble: \"Here! On the spot! Come on! Swords! Swords! Blood on the\npavement!\"\n\nBut the other never stirred. When he beheld his adversary on guard and\nready to parry,--\n\n\"Captain Phoebus,\" he said, and his tone vibrated with bitterness, \"you\nforget your appointment.\"\n\nThe rages of men like Phoebus are milk-soups, whose ebullition is calmed\nby a drop of cold water. This simple remark caused the sword which\nglittered in the captain's hand to be lowered.\n\n\"Captain,\" pursued the man, \"to-morrow, the day after to-morrow, a month\nhence, ten years hence, you will find me ready to cut your throat; but\ngo first to your rendezvous.\"\n\n\"In sooth,\" said Phoebus, as though seeking to capitulate with himself,\n\"these are two charming things to be encountered in a rendezvous,--a\nsword and a wench; but I do not see why I should miss the one for the\nsake of the other, when I can have both.\"\n\nHe replaced his sword in its scabbard.\n\n\"Go to your rendezvous,\" said the man.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied Phoebus with some embarrassment, \"many thanks for\nyour courtesy. In fact, there will be ample time to-morrow for us to\nchop up father Adam's doublet into slashes and buttonholes. I am obliged\nto you for allowing me to pass one more agreeable quarter of an hour.\nI certainly did hope to put you in the gutter, and still arrive in time\nfor the fair one, especially as it has a better appearance to make the\nwomen wait a little in such cases. But you strike me as having the air\nof a gallant man, and it is safer to defer our affair until to-morrow.\nSo I will betake myself to my rendezvous; it is for seven o'clock, as\nyou know.\" Here Phoebus scratched his ear. \"Ah. _Corne Dieu_! I had\nforgotten! I haven't a sou to discharge the price of the garret, and the\nold crone will insist on being paid in advance. She distrusts me.\"\n\n\"Here is the wherewithal to pay.\"\n\nPhoebus felt the stranger's cold hand slip into his a large piece of\nmoney. He could not refrain from taking the money and pressing the hand.\n\n\"_Vrai Dieu_!\" he exclaimed, \"you are a good fellow!\"\n\n\"One condition,\" said the man. \"Prove to me that I have been wrong and\nthat you were speaking the truth. Hide me in some corner whence I can\nsee whether this woman is really the one whose name you uttered.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" replied Phoebus, \"'tis all one to me. We will take, the\nSainte-Marthe chamber; you can look at your ease from the kennel hard\nby.\"\n\n\"Come then,\" said the shadow.\n\n\"At your service,\" said the captain, \"I know not whether you are\nMesser Diavolus in person; but let us be good friends for this evening;\nto-morrow I will repay you all my debts, both of purse and sword.\"\n\nThey set out again at a rapid pace. At the expiration of a few minutes,\nthe sound of the river announced to them that they were on the Pont\nSaint-Michel, then loaded with houses.\n\n\"I will first show you the way,\" said Phoebus to his companion, \"I\nwill then go in search of the fair one who is awaiting me near the\nPetit-Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet.\"\n\nHis companion made no reply; he had not uttered a word since they had\nbeen walking side by side. Phoebus halted before a low door, and knocked\nroughly; a light made its appearance through the cracks of the door.\n\n\"Who is there?\" cried a toothless voice.\n\n\"_Corps-Dieu! T\u00c3\u00aate-Dieu! Ventre-Dieu_!\" replied the captain.\n\nThe door opened instantly, and allowed the new-corners to see an old\nwoman and an old lamp, both of which trembled. The old woman was bent\ndouble, clad in tatters, with a shaking head, pierced with two small\neyes, and coiffed with a dish clout; wrinkled everywhere, on hands and\nface and neck; her lips retreated under her gums, and about her mouth\nshe had tufts of white hairs which gave her the whiskered look of a cat.\n\nThe interior of the den was no less dilapitated than she; there were\nchalk walls, blackened beams in the ceiling, a dismantled chimney-piece,\nspiders' webs in all the corners, in the middle a staggering herd of\ntables and lame stools, a dirty child among the ashes, and at the back a\nstaircase, or rather, a wooden ladder, which ended in a trap door in the\nceiling.\n\nOn entering this lair, Phoebus's mysterious companion raised his mantle\nto his very eyes. Meanwhile, the captain, swearing like a Saracen,\nhastened to \"make the sun shine in a crown\" as saith our admirable\nR\u00c3\u00a9gnier.\n\n\"The Sainte-Marthe chamber,\" said he.\n\nThe old woman addressed him as monseigneur, and shut up the crown in a\ndrawer. It was the coin which the man in the black mantle had given to\nPhoebus. While her back was turned, the bushy-headed and ragged little\nboy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer,\nabstracted the crown, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had\nplucked from a fagot.\n\nThe old crone made a sign to the two gentlemen, as she called them, to\nfollow her, and mounted the ladder in advance of them. On arriving at\nthe upper story, she set her lamp on a coffer, and, Phoebus, like a\nfrequent visitor of the house, opened a door which opened on a dark\nhole. \"Enter here, my dear fellow,\" he said to his companion. The man in\nthe mantle obeyed without a word in reply, the door closed upon him; he\nheard Phoebus bolt it, and a moment later descend the stairs again with\nthe aged hag. The light had disappeared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. THE UTILITY OF WINDOWS WHICH OPEN ON THE RIVER.\n\n\n\nClaude Frollo (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than\nPhoebus, has seen in this whole adventure no other surly monk than the\narchdeacon), Claude Frollo groped about for several moments in the dark\nlair into which the captain had bolted him. It was one of those nooks\nwhich architects sometimes reserve at the point of junction between\nthe roof and the supporting wall. A vertical section of this kennel, as\nPhoebus had so justly styled it, would have made a triangle. Moreover,\nthere was neither window nor air-hole, and the slope of the roof\nprevented one from standing upright. Accordingly, Claude crouched down\nin the dust, and the plaster which cracked beneath him; his head was on\nfire; rummaging around him with his hands, he found on the floor a\nbit of broken glass, which he pressed to his brow, and whose cool-ness\nafforded him some relief.\n\nWhat was taking place at that moment in the gloomy soul of the\narchdeacon? God and himself could alone know.\n\nIn what order was he arranging in his mind la Esmeralda, Phoebus,\nJacques Charmolue, his young brother so beloved, yet abandoned by him in\nthe mire, his archdeacon's cassock, his reputation perhaps dragged to la\nFalourdel's, all these adventures, all these images? I cannot say. But\nit is certain that these ideas formed in his mind a horrible group.\n\nHe had been waiting a quarter of an hour; it seemed to him that he had\ngrown a century older. All at once he heard the creaking of the boards\nof the stairway; some one was ascending. The trapdoor opened once more;\na light reappeared. There was a tolerably large crack in the worm-eaten\ndoor of his den; he put his face to it. In this manner he could see\nall that went on in the adjoining room. The cat-faced old crone was the\nfirst to emerge from the trap-door, lamp in hand; then Phoebus, twirling\nhis moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure,\nla Esmeralda. The priest beheld her rise from below like a dazzling\napparition. Claude trembled, a cloud spread over his eyes, his pulses\nbeat violently, everything rustled and whirled around him; he no longer\nsaw nor heard anything.\n\nWhen he recovered himself, Phoebus and Esmeralda were alone seated on\nthe wooden coffer beside the lamp which made these two youthful figures\nand a miserable pallet at the end of the attic stand out plainly before\nthe archdeacon's eyes.\n\nBeside the pallet was a window, whose panes broken like a spider's web\nupon which rain has fallen, allowed a view, through its rent meshes, of\na corner of the sky, and the moon lying far away on an eiderdown bed of\nsoft clouds.\n\nThe young girl was blushing, confused, palpitating. Her long, drooping\nlashes shaded her crimson cheeks. The officer, to whom she dared\nnot lift her eyes, was radiant. Mechanically, and with a charmingly\nunconscious gesture, she traced with the tip of her finger incoherent\nlines on the bench, and watched her finger. Her foot was not visible.\nThe little goat was nestling upon it.\n\nThe captain was very gallantly clad; he had tufts of embroidery at his\nneck and wrists; a great elegance at that day.\n\nIt was not without difficulty that Dom Claude managed to hear what they\nwere saying, through the humming of the blood, which was boiling in his\ntemples.\n\n(A conversation between lovers is a very commonplace affair. It is a\nperpetual \"I love you.\" A musical phrase which is very insipid and very\nbald for indifferent listeners, when it is not ornamented with some\n_fioriture_; but Claude was not an indifferent listener.)\n\n\"Oh!\" said the young girl, without raising her eyes, \"do not despise me,\nmonseigneur Phoebus. I feel that what I am doing is not right.\"\n\n\"Despise you, my pretty child!\" replied the officer with an air of\nsuperior and distinguished gallantry, \"despise you, _t\u00c3\u00aate-Dieu_! and\nwhy?\"\n\n\"For having followed you!\"\n\n\"On that point, my beauty, we don't agree. I ought not to despise you,\nbut to hate you.\"\n\nThe young girl looked at him in affright: \"Hate me! what have I done?\"\n\n\"For having required so much urging.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said she, \"'tis because I am breaking a vow. I shall not find my\nparents! The amulet will lose its virtue. But what matters it? What need\nhave I of father or mother now?\"\n\nSo saying, she fixed upon the captain her great black eyes, moist with\njoy and tenderness.\n\n\"Devil take me if I understand you!\" exclaimed Phoebus. La Esmeralda\nremained silent for a moment, then a tear dropped from her eyes, a sigh\nfrom her lips, and she said,--\"Oh! monseigneur, I love you.\"\n\nSuch a perfume of chastity, such a charm of virtue surrounded the young\ngirl, that Phoebus did not feel completely at his ease beside her. But\nthis remark emboldened him: \"You love me!\" he said with rapture, and he\nthrew his arm round the gypsy's waist. He had only been waiting for this\nopportunity.\n\nThe priest saw it, and tested with the tip of his finger the point of a\nponiard which he wore concealed in his breast.\n\n\"Phoebus,\" continued the Bohemian, gently releasing her waist from the\ncaptain's tenacious hands, \"You are good, you are generous, you are\nhandsome; you saved me, me who am only a poor child lost in Bohemia. I\nhad long been dreaming of an officer who should save my life. 'Twas of\nyou that I was dreaming, before I knew you, my Phoebus; the officer of\nmy dream had a beautiful uniform like yours, a grand look, a sword; your\nname is Phoebus; 'tis a beautiful name. I love your name; I love your\nsword. Draw your sword, Phoebus, that I may see it.\"\n\n\"Child!\" said the captain, and he unsheathed his sword with a smile.\n\nThe gypsy looked at the hilt, the blade; examined the cipher on the\nguard with adorable curiosity, and kissed the sword, saying,--\n\n\"You are the sword of a brave man. I love my captain.\" Phoebus again\nprofited by the opportunity to impress upon her beautiful bent neck a\nkiss which made the young girl straighten herself up as scarlet as a\npoppy. The priest gnashed his teeth over it in the dark.\n\n\"Phoebus,\" resumed the gypsy, \"let me talk to you. Pray walk a little,\nthat I may see you at full height, and that I may hear your spurs\njingle. How handsome you are!\"\n\nThe captain rose to please her, chiding her with a smile of\nsatisfaction,--\n\n\"What a child you are! By the way, my charmer, have you seen me in my\narcher's ceremonial doublet?\"\n\n\"Alas! no,\" she replied.\n\n\"It is very handsome!\"\n\nPhoebus returned and seated himself beside her, but much closer than\nbefore.\n\n\"Listen, my dear--\"\n\nThe gypsy gave him several little taps with her pretty hand on his\nmouth, with a childish mirth and grace and gayety.\n\n\"No, no, I will not listen to you. Do you love me? I want you to tell me\nwhether you love me.\"\n\n\"Do I love thee, angel of my life!\" exclaimed the captain, half\nkneeling. \"My body, my blood, my soul, all are thine; all are for thee.\nI love thee, and I have never loved any one but thee.\"\n\nThe captain had repeated this phrase so many times, in many similar\nconjunctures, that he delivered it all in one breath, without committing\na single mistake. At this passionate declaration, the gypsy raised to\nthe dirty ceiling which served for the skies a glance full of angelic\nhappiness.\n\n\"Oh!\" she murmured, \"this is the moment when one should die!\"\n\nPhoebus found \"the moment\" favorable for robbing her of another kiss,\nwhich went to torture the unhappy archdeacon in his nook. \"Die!\"\nexclaimed the amorous captain, \"What are you saying, my lovely angel?\n'Tis a time for living, or Jupiter is only a scamp! Die at the beginning\nof so sweet a thing! _Corne-de-boeuf_, what a jest! It is not that.\nListen, my dear Similar, Esmenarda--Pardon! you have so prodigiously\nSaracen a name that I never can get it straight. 'Tis a thicket which\nstops me short.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said the poor girl, \"and I thought my name pretty\nbecause of its singularity! But since it displeases you, I would that I\nwere called Goton.\"\n\n\"Ah! do not weep for such a trifle, my graceful maid! 'tis a name to\nwhich one must get accustomed, that is all. When I once know it by\nheart, all will go smoothly. Listen then, my dear Similar; I adore you\npassionately. I love you so that 'tis simply miraculous. I know a girl\nwho is bursting with rage over it--\"\n\nThe jealous girl interrupted him: \"Who?\"\n\n\"What matters that to us?\" said Phoebus; \"do you love me?\"\n\n\"Oh!\"--said she.\n\n\"Well! that is all. You shall see how I love you also. May the great\ndevil Neptunus spear me if I do not make you the happiest woman in the\nworld. We will have a pretty little house somewhere. I will make my\narchers parade before your windows. They are all mounted, and set at\ndefiance those of Captain Mignon. There are _voulgiers, cranequiniers_\nand hand _couleveiniers_*. I will take you to the great sights of the\nParisians at the storehouse of Rully. Eighty thousand armed men, thirty\nthousand white harnesses, short coats or coats of mail; the sixty-seven\nbanners of the trades; the standards of the parliaments, of the chamber\nof accounts, of the treasury of the generals, of the aides of the mint;\na devilish fine array, in short! I will conduct you to see the lions of\nthe H\u00c3\u00b4tel du Roi, which are wild beasts. All women love that.\"\n\n\n     * Varieties of the crossbow.\n\n\nFor several moments the young girl, absorbed in her charming thoughts,\nwas dreaming to the sound of his voice, without listening to the sense\nof his words.\n\n\"Oh! how happy you will be!\" continued the captain, and at the same time\nhe gently unbuckled the gypsy's girdle.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" she said quickly. This \"act of violence\" had\nroused her from her revery.\n\n\"Nothing,\" replied Phoebus, \"I was only saying that you must abandon all\nthis garb of folly, and the street corner when you are with me.\"\n\n\"When I am with you, Phoebus!\" said the young girl tenderly.\n\nShe became pensive and silent once more.\n\nThe captain, emboldened by her gentleness, clasped her waist without\nresistance; then began softly to unlace the poor child's corsage, and\ndisarranged her tucker to such an extent that the panting priest beheld\nthe gypsy's beautiful shoulder emerge from the gauze, as round and brown\nas the moon rising through the mists of the horizon.\n\nThe young girl allowed Phoebus to have his way. She did not appear to\nperceive it. The eye of the bold captain flashed.\n\nSuddenly she turned towards him,--\n\n\"Phoebus,\" she said, with an expression of infinite love, \"instruct me\nin thy religion.\"\n\n\"My religion!\" exclaimed the captain, bursting with laughter, \"I\ninstruct you in my religion! _Corne et tonnerre_! What do you want with\nmy religion?\"\n\n\"In order that we may be married,\" she replied.\n\nThe captain's face assumed an expression of mingled surprise and\ndisdain, of carelessness and libertine passion.\n\n\"Ah, bah!\" said he, \"do people marry?\"\n\nThe Bohemian turned pale, and her head drooped sadly on her breast.\n\n\"My beautiful love,\" resumed Phoebus, tenderly, \"what nonsense is this?\nA great thing is marriage, truly! one is none the less loving for not\nhaving spit Latin into a priest's shop!\"\n\nWhile speaking thus in his softest voice, he approached extremely near\nthe gypsy; his caressing hands resumed their place around her supple and\ndelicate waist, his eye flashed more and more, and everything announced\nthat Monsieur Phoebus was on the verge of one of those moments when\nJupiter himself commits so many follies that Homer is obliged to summon\na cloud to his rescue.\n\nBut Dom Claude saw everything. The door was made of thoroughly rotten\ncask staves, which left large apertures for the passage of his hawklike\ngaze. This brown-skinned, broad-shouldered priest, hitherto condemned to\nthe austere virginity of the cloister, was quivering and boiling in the\npresence of this night scene of love and voluptuousness. This young\nand beautiful girl given over in disarray to the ardent young man, made\nmelted lead flow in his-veins; his eyes darted with sensual jealousy\nbeneath all those loosened pins. Any one who could, at that moment, have\nseen the face of the unhappy man glued to the wormeaten bars, would have\nthought that he beheld the face of a tiger glaring from the depths of\na cage at some jackal devouring a gazelle. His eye shone like a candle\nthrough the cracks of the door.\n\nAll at once, Phoebus, with a rapid gesture, removed the gypsy's\ngorgerette. The poor child, who had remained pale and dreamy, awoke\nwith a start; she recoiled hastily from the enterprising officer, and,\ncasting a glance at her bare neck and shoulders, red, confused, mute\nwith shame, she crossed her two beautiful arms on her breast to conceal\nit. Had it not been for the flame which burned in her cheeks, at the\nsight of her so silent and motionless, one would have declared her a\nstatue of Modesty. Her eyes were lowered.\n\nBut the captain's gesture had revealed the mysterious amulet which she\nwore about her neck.\n\n\"What is that?\" he said, seizing this pretext to approach once more the\nbeautiful creature whom he had just alarmed.\n\n\"Don't touch it!\" she replied, quickly, \"'tis my guardian. It will make\nme find my family again, if I remain worthy to do so. Oh, leave me,\nmonsieur le capitaine! My mother! My poor mother! My mother! Where art\nthou? Come to my rescue! Have pity, Monsieur Phoebus, give me back my\ngorgerette!\"\n\nPhoebus retreated amid said in a cold tone,--\n\n\"Oh, mademoiselle! I see plainly that you do not love me!\"\n\n\"I do not love him!\" exclaimed the unhappy child, and at the same time\nshe clung to the captain, whom she drew to a seat beside her. \"I do not\nlove thee, my Phoebus? What art thou saying, wicked man, to break my\nheart? Oh, take me! take all! do what you will with me, I am thine. What\nmatters to me the amulet! What matters to me my mother! 'Tis thou who\nart my mother since I love thee! Phoebus, my beloved Phoebus, dost thou\nsee me? 'Tis I. Look at me; 'tis the little one whom thou wilt surely\nnot repulse, who comes, who comes herself to seek thee. My soul, my\nlife, my body, my person, all is one thing--which is thine, my captain.\nWell, no! We will not marry, since that displeases thee; and then, what\nam I? a miserable girl of the gutters; whilst thou, my Phoebus, art a\ngentleman. A fine thing, truly! A dancer wed an officer! I was mad. No,\nPhoebus, no; I will be thy mistress, thy amusement, thy pleasure, when\nthou wilt; a girl who shall belong to thee. I was only made for that,\nsoiled, despised, dishonored, but what matters it?--beloved. I shall be\nthe proudest and the most joyous of women. And when I grow old or ugly,\nPhoebus, when I am no longer good to love you, you will suffer me to\nserve you still. Others will embroider scarfs for you; 'tis I, the\nservant, who will care for them. You will let me polish your spurs,\nbrush your doublet, dust your riding-boots. You will have that pity,\nwill you not, Phoebus? Meanwhile, take me! here, Phoebus, all this\nbelongs to thee, only love me! We gypsies need only air and love.\"\n\nSo saying, she threw her arms round the officer's neck; she looked up\nat him, supplicatingly, with a beautiful smile, and all in tears.\nHer delicate neck rubbed against his cloth doublet with its rough\nembroideries. She writhed on her knees, her beautiful body half naked.\nThe intoxicated captain pressed his ardent lips to those lovely African\nshoulders. The young girl, her eyes bent on the ceiling, as she leaned\nbackwards, quivered, all palpitating, beneath this kiss.\n\nAll at once, above Phoebus's head she beheld another head; a green,\nlivid, convulsed face, with the look of a lost soul; near this face was\na hand grasping a poniard.--It was the face and hand of the priest; he\nhad broken the door and he was there. Phoebus could not see him. The\nyoung girl remained motionless, frozen with terror, dumb, beneath that\nterrible apparition, like a dove which should raise its head at the\nmoment when the hawk is gazing into her nest with its round eyes.\n\nShe could not even utter a cry. She saw the poniard descend upon\nPhoebus, and rise again, reeking.\n\n\"Maledictions!\" said the captain, and fell.\n\nShe fainted.\n\nAt the moment when her eyes closed, when all feeling vanished in her,\nshe thought that she felt a touch of fire imprinted upon her lips, a\nkiss more burning than the red-hot iron of the executioner.\n\nWhen she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the\nwatch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the\npriest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened\non the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed\nto belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,\n\n\"'Tis a sorceress who has stabbed a captain.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE CROWN CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.\n\n\n\nGringoire and the entire Court of Miracles were suffering mortal\nanxiety. For a whole month they had not known what had become of la\nEsmeralda, which greatly pained the Duke of Egypt and his friends the\nvagabonds, nor what had become of the goat, which redoubled Gringoire's\ngrief. One evening the gypsy had disappeared, and since that time had\ngiven no signs of life. All search had proved fruitless. Some tormenting\nbootblacks had told Gringoire about meeting her that same evening near\nthe Pont Saint-Michel, going off with an officer; but this husband,\nafter the fashion of Bohemia, was an incredulous philosopher, and\nbesides, he, better than any one else, knew to what a point his wife was\nvirginal. He had been able to form a judgment as to the unconquerable\nmodesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy,\nand he had mathematically calculated the resistance of that chastity to\nthe second power. Accordingly, he was at ease on that score.\n\nStill he could not understand this disappearance. It was a profound\nsorrow. He would have grown thin over it, had that been possible. He had\nforgotten everything, even his literary tastes, even his great work,\n_De figuris regularibus et irregularibus_, which it was his intention\nto have printed with the first money which he should procure (for he had\nraved over printing, ever since he had seen the \"Didascalon\" of Hugues\nde Saint Victor, printed with the celebrated characters of Vindelin de\nSpire).\n\nOne day, as he was passing sadly before the criminal Tournelle, he\nperceived a considerable crowd at one of the gates of the Palais de\nJustice.\n\n\"What is this?\" he inquired of a young man who was coming out.\n\n\"I know not, sir,\" replied the young man. \"'Tis said that they are\ntrying a woman who hath assassinated a gendarme. It appears that there\nis sorcery at the bottom of it, the archbishop and the official have\nintervened in the case, and my brother, who is the archdeacon of Josas,\ncan think of nothing else. Now, I wished to speak with him, but I\nhave not been able to reach him because of the throng, which vexes me\ngreatly, as I stand in need of money.\"\n\n\"Alas! sir,\" said Gringoire, \"I would that I could lend you some, but,\nmy breeches are worn to holes, and 'tis not crowns which have done it.\"\n\nHe dared not tell the young man that he was acquainted with his brother\nthe archdeacon, to whom he had not returned after the scene in the\nchurch; a negligence which embarrassed him.\n\nThe scholar went his way, and Gringoire set out to follow the crowd\nwhich was mounting the staircase of the great chamber. In his opinion,\nthere was nothing like the spectacle of a criminal process for\ndissipating melancholy, so exhilaratingly stupid are judges as a rule.\nThe populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence. After\na slow and tiresome march through a long, gloomy corridor, which\nwound through the court-house like the intestinal canal of the ancient\nedifice, he arrived near a low door, opening upon a hall which his lofty\nstature permitted him to survey with a glance over the waving heads of\nthe rabble.\n\nThe hall was vast and gloomy, which latter fact made it appear still\nmore spacious. The day was declining; the long, pointed windows\npermitted only a pale ray of light to enter, which was extinguished\nbefore it reached the vaulted ceiling, an enormous trellis-work of\nsculptured beams, whose thousand figures seemed to move confusedly in\nthe shadows, many candles were already lighted here and there on tables,\nand beaming on the heads of clerks buried in masses of documents. The\nanterior portion of the ball was occupied by the crowd; on the right and\nleft were magistrates and tables; at the end, upon a platform, a\nnumber of judges, whose rear rank sank into the shadows, sinister and\nmotionless faces. The walls were sown with innumerable fleurs-de-lis. A\nlarge figure of Christ might be vaguely descried above the judges,\nand everywhere there were pikes and halberds, upon whose points the\nreflection of the candles placed tips of fire.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" Gringoire inquired of one of his neighbors, \"who are all\nthose persons ranged yonder, like prelates in council?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" replied the neighbor, \"those on the right are the\ncounsellors of the grand chamber; those on the left, the councillors of\ninquiry; the masters in black gowns, the messires in red.\"\n\n\"Who is that big red fellow, yonder above them, who is sweating?\"\npursued Gringoire.\n\n\"It is monsieur the president.\"\n\n\"And those sheep behind him?\" continued Gringoire, who as we have seen,\ndid not love the magistracy, which arose, possibly, from the grudge\nwhich he cherished against the Palais de Justice since his dramatic\nmisadventure.\n\n\"They are messieurs the masters of requests of the king's household.\"\n\n\"And that boar in front of him?\"\n\n\"He is monsieur the clerk of the Court of Parliament.\"\n\n\"And that crocodile on the right?\"\n\n\"Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king.\"\n\n\"And that big, black tom-cat on the left?\"\n\n\"Master Jacques Charmolue, procurator of the king in the Ecclesiastical\nCourt, with the gentlemen of the officialty.\"\n\n\"Come now, monsieur,\" said Gringoire, \"pray what are all those fine\nfellows doing yonder?\"\n\n\"They are judging.\"\n\n\"Judging whom? I do not see the accused.\"\n\n\"'Tis a woman, sir. You cannot see her. She has her back turned to us,\nand she is hidden from us by the crowd. Stay, yonder she is, where you\nsee a group of partisans.\"\n\n\"Who is the woman?\" asked Gringoire. \"Do you know her name?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur, I have but just arrived. I merely assume that there is\nsome sorcery about it, since the official is present at the trial.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said our philosopher, \"we are going to see all these magistrates\ndevour human flesh. 'Tis as good a spectacle as any other.\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" remarked his neighbor, \"think you not, that Master Jacques\nCharmolue has a very sweet air?\"\n\n\"Hum!\" replied Gringoire. \"I distrust a sweetness which hath pinched\nnostrils and thin lips.\"\n\nHere the bystanders imposed silence upon the two chatterers. They were\nlistening to an important deposition.\n\n\"Messeigneurs,\" said an old woman in the middle of the hall, whose form\nwas so concealed beneath her garments that one would have pronounced her\na walking heap of rags; \"Messeigneurs, the thing is as true as that I\nam la Falourdel, established these forty years at the Pont Saint Michel,\nand paying regularly my rents, lord's dues, and quit rents; at the gate\nopposite the house of Tassin-Caillart, the dyer, which is on the side\nup the river--a poor old woman now, but a pretty maid in former days,\nmy lords. Some one said to me lately, 'La Falourdel, don't use your\nspinning-wheel too much in the evening; the devil is fond of combing the\ndistaffs of old women with his horns. 'Tis certain that the surly monk\nwho was round about the temple last year, now prowls in the City. Take\ncare, La Falourdel, that he doth not knock at your door.' One evening I\nwas spinning on my wheel, there comes a knock at my door; I ask who it\nis. They swear. I open. Two men enter. A man in black and a handsome\nofficer. Of the black man nothing could be seen but his eyes, two\ncoals of fire. All the rest was hat and cloak. They say to me,--'The\nSainte-Marthe chamber.'--'Tis my upper chamber, my lords, my cleanest.\nThey give me a crown. I put the crown in my drawer, and I say: 'This\nshall go to buy tripe at the slaughter-house of la Gloriette to-morrow.'\nWe go up stairs. On arriving at the upper chamber, and while my back is\nturned, the black man disappears. That dazed me a bit. The officer, who\nwas as handsome as a great lord, goes down stairs again with me. He goes\nout. In about the time it takes to spin a quarter of a handful of flax,\nhe returns with a beautiful young girl, a doll who would have shone like\nthe sun had she been coiffed. She had with her a goat; a big billy-goat,\nwhether black or white, I no longer remember. That set me to thinking.\nThe girl does not concern me, but the goat! I love not those beasts,\nthey have a beard and horns. They are so like a man. And then, they\nsmack of the witches, sabbath. However, I say nothing. I had the crown.\nThat is right, is it not, Monsieur Judge? I show the captain and the\nwench to the upper chamber, and I leave them alone; that is to say, with\nthe goat. I go down and set to spinning again--I must inform you that\nmy house has a ground floor and story above. I know not why I fell to\nthinking of the surly monk whom the goat had put into my head again, and\nthen the beautiful girl was rather strangely decked out. All at once,\nI hear a cry upstairs, and something falls on the floor and the window\nopens. I run to mine which is beneath it, and I behold a black mass pass\nbefore my eyes and fall into the water. It was a phantom clad like\na priest. It was a moonlight night. I saw him quite plainly. He was\nswimming in the direction of the city. Then, all of a tremble, I call\nthe watch. The gentlemen of the police enter, and not knowing just at\nthe first moment what the matter was, and being merry, they beat me. I\nexplain to them. We go up stairs, and what do we find? my poor chamber\nall blood, the captain stretched out at full length with a dagger in\nhis neck, the girl pretending to be dead, and the goat all in a fright.\n'Pretty work!' I say, 'I shall have to wash that floor for more than a\nfortnight. It will have to be scraped; it will be a terrible job.' They\ncarried off the officer, poor young man, and the wench with her bosom\nall bare. But wait, the worst is that on the next day, when I wanted to\ntake the crown to buy tripe, I found a dead leaf in its place.\"\n\nThe old woman ceased. A murmur of horror ran through the audience.\n\n\"That phantom, that goat,--all smacks of magic,\" said one of Gringoire's\nneighbors.\n\n\"And that dry leaf!\" added another.\n\n\"No doubt about it,\" joined in a third, \"she is a witch who has dealings\nwith the surly monk, for the purpose of plundering officers.\"\n\nGringoire himself was not disinclined to regard this as altogether\nalarming and probable.\n\n\"Goody Falourdel,\" said the president majestically, \"have you nothing\nmore to communicate to the court?\"\n\n\"No, monseigneur,\" replied the crone, \"except that the report has\ndescribed my house as a hovel and stinking; which is an outrageous\nfashion of speaking. The houses on the bridge are not imposing, because\nthere are such multitudes of people; but, nevertheless, the butchers\ncontinue to dwell there, who are wealthy folk, and married to very\nproper and handsome women.\"\n\nThe magistrate who had reminded Gringoire of a crocodile rose,--\n\n\"Silence!\" said he. \"I pray the gentlemen not to lose sight of the fact\nthat a dagger was found on the person of the accused. Goody Falourdel,\nhave you brought that leaf into which the crown which the demon gave you\nwas transformed?\n\n\"Yes, monseigneur,\" she replied; \"I found it again. Here it is.\"\n\nA bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile, who made a doleful\nshake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the\nprocurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, and thus it made the\ncircuit of the hail.\n\n\"It is a birch leaf,\" said Master Jacques Charmolue. \"A fresh proof of\nmagic.\"\n\nA counsellor took up the word.\n\n\"Witness, two men went upstairs together in your house: the black man,\nwhom you first saw disappear and afterwards swimming in the Seine, with\nhis priestly garments, and the officer. Which of the two handed you\nthe crown?\" The old woman pondered for a moment and then said,--\"The\nofficer.\"\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd.\n\n\"Ah!\" thought Gringoire, \"this makes some doubt in my mind.\"\n\nBut Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary to the king,\ninterposed once more.\n\n\"I will recall to these gentlemen, that in the deposition taken at his\nbedside, the assassinated officer, while declaring that he had a vague\nidea when the black man accosted him that the latter might be the surly\nmonk, added that the phantom had pressed him eagerly to go and make\nacquaintance with the accused; and upon his, the captain's, remarking\nthat he had no money, he had given him the crown which the said officer\npaid to la Falourdel. Hence, that crown is the money of hell.\"\n\nThis conclusive observation appeared to dissipate all the doubts of\nGringoire and the other sceptics in the audience.\n\n\"You have the documents, gentlemen,\" added the king's advocate, as\nhe took his seat; \"you can consult the testimony of Phoebus de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers.\"\n\nAt that name, the accused sprang up, her head rose above the throng.\nGringoire with horror recognized la Esmeralda.\n\nShe was pale; her tresses, formerly so gracefully braided and spangled\nwith sequins, hung in disorder; her lips were blue, her hollow eyes were\nterrible. Alas!\n\n\"Phoebus!\" she said, in bewilderment; \"where is he? O messeigneurs!\nbefore you kill me, tell me, for pity sake, whether he still lives?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, woman,\" replied the president, \"that is no affair of\nours.\"\n\n\"Oh! for mercy's sake, tell me if he is alive!\" she repeated, clasping\nher beautiful emaciated hands; and the sound of her chains in contact\nwith her dress, was heard.\n\n\"Well!\" said the king's advocate roughly, \"he is dying. Are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\nThe unhappy girl fell back on her criminal's seat, speechless, tearless,\nwhite as a wax figure.\n\nThe president bent down to a man at his feet, who wore a gold cap and a\nblack gown, a chain on his neck and a wand in his hand.\n\n\"Bailiff, bring in the second accused.\"\n\nAll eyes turned towards a small door, which opened, and, to the great\nagitation of Gringoire, gave passage to a pretty goat with horns and\nhoofs of gold. The elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold,\nstretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a rock, it\nhad before its eyes an immense horizon. Suddenly it caught sight of the\ngypsy girl, and leaping over the table and the head of a clerk, in two\nbounds it was at her knees; then it rolled gracefully on its mistress's\nfeet, soliciting a word or a caress; but the accused remained\nmotionless, and poor Djali himself obtained not a glance.\n\n\"Eh, why--'tis my villanous beast,\" said old Falourdel, \"I recognize the\ntwo perfectly!\"\n\nJacques Charmolue interfered.\n\n\"If the gentlemen please, we will proceed to the examination of the\ngoat.\" He was, in fact, the second criminal. Nothing more simple in\nthose days than a suit of sorcery instituted against an animal. We find,\namong others in the accounts of the provost's office for 1466, a curious\ndetail concerning the expenses of the trial of Gillet-Soulart and his\nsow, \"executed for their demerits,\" at Corbeil. Everything is there, the\ncost of the pens in which to place the sow, the five hundred bundles of\nbrushwood purchased at the port of Morsant, the three pints of wine\nand the bread, the last repast of the victim fraternally shared by the\nexecutioner, down to the eleven days of guard and food for the sow,\nat eight deniers parisis each. Sometimes, they went even further than\nanimals. The capitularies of Charlemagne and of Louis le D\u00c3\u00a9bonnaire\nimpose severe penalties on fiery phantoms which presume to appear in the\nair.\n\nMeanwhile the procurator had exclaimed: \"If the demon which possesses\nthis goat, and which has resisted all exorcisms, persists in its deeds\nof witchcraft, if it alarms the court with them, we warn it that we\nshall be forced to put in requisition against it the gallows or the\nstake. Gringoire broke out into a cold perspiration. Charmolue took from\nthe table the gypsy's tambourine, and presenting it to the goat, in a\ncertain manner, asked the latter,--\n\n\"What o'clock is it?\"\n\nThe goat looked at it with an intelligent eye, raised its gilded hoof,\nand struck seven blows.\n\nIt was, in fact, seven o'clock. A movement of terror ran through the\ncrowd.\n\nGringoire could not endure it.\n\n\"He is destroying himself!\" he cried aloud; \"You see well that he does\nnot know what he is doing.\"\n\n\"Silence among the louts at the end of the hail!\" said the bailiff\nsharply.\n\nJacques Charmolue, by the aid of the same manoeuvres of the tambourine,\nmade the goat perform many other tricks connected with the date of\nthe day, the month of the year, etc., which the reader has already\nwitnessed. And, by virtue of an optical illusion peculiar to judicial\nproceedings, these same spectators who had, probably, more than once\napplauded in the public square Djali's innocent magic were terrified by\nit beneath the roof of the Palais de Justice. The goat was undoubtedly\nthe devil.\n\nIt was far worse when the procurator of the king, having emptied upon a\nfloor a certain bag filled with movable letters, which Djali wore round\nhis neck, they beheld the goat extract with his hoof from the scattered\nalphabet the fatal name of Phoebus. The witchcraft of which the captain\nhad been the victim appeared irresistibly demonstrated, and in the eyes\nof all, the gypsy, that ravishing dancer, who had so often dazzled\nthe passers-by with her grace, was no longer anything but a frightful\nvampire.\n\nHowever, she betrayed no sign of life; neither Djali's graceful\nevolutions, nor the menaces of the court, nor the suppressed\nimprecations of the spectators any longer reached her mind.\n\nIn order to arouse her, a police officer was obliged to shake her\nunmercifully, and the president had to raise his voice,--\"Girl, you\nare of the Bohemian race, addicted to deeds of witchcraft. You, in\ncomplicity with the bewitched goat implicated in this suit, during\nthe night of the twenty-ninth of March last, murdered and stabbed, in\nconcert with the powers of darkness, by the aid of charms and underhand\npractices, a captain of the king's arches of the watch, Phoebus de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers. Do you persist in denying it?\"\n\n\"Horror!\" exclaimed the young girl, hiding her face in her hands. \"My\nPhoebus! Oh, this is hell!\"\n\n\"Do you persist in your denial?\" demanded the president coldly.\n\n\"Do I deny it?\" she said with terrible accents; and she rose with\nflashing eyes.\n\nThe president continued squarely,--\n\n\"Then how do you explain the facts laid to your charge?\"\n\nShe replied in a broken voice,--\n\n\"I have already told you. I do not know. 'Twas a priest, a priest whom I\ndo not know; an infernal priest who pursues me!\"\n\n\"That is it,\" retorted the judge; \"the surly monk.\"\n\n\"Oh, gentlemen! have mercy! I am but a poor girl--\"\n\n\"Of Egypt,\" said the judge.\n\nMaster Jacques Charmolue interposed sweetly,--\n\n\"In view of the sad obstinacy of the accused, I demand the application\nof the torture.\"\n\n\"Granted,\" said the president.\n\nThe unhappy girl quivered in every limb. But she rose at the command of\nthe men with partisans, and walked with a tolerably firm step, preceded\nby Charmolue and the priests of the officiality, between two rows of\nhalberds, towards a medium-sized door which suddenly opened and closed\nagain behind her, and which produced upon the grief-stricken Gringoire\nthe effect of a horrible mouth which had just devoured her.\n\nWhen she disappeared, they heard a plaintive bleating; it was the little\ngoat mourning.\n\nThe sitting of the court was suspended. A counsellor having remarked\nthat the gentlemen were fatigued, and that it would be a long time\nto wait until the torture was at an end, the president replied that a\nmagistrate must know how to sacrifice himself to his duty.\n\n\"What an annoying and vexatious hussy,\" said an aged judge, \"to get\nherself put to the question when one has not supped!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. CONTINUATION OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS CHANGED INTO A DRY LEAF.\n\n\n\nAfter ascending and descending several steps in the corridors, which\nwere so dark that they were lighted by lamps at mid-day, La Esmeralda,\nstill surrounded by her lugubrious escort, was thrust by the police into\na gloomy chamber. This chamber, circular in form, occupied the ground\nfloor of one of those great towers, which, even in our own century,\nstill pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern\nParis has covered ancient Paris. There were no windows to this cellar;\nno other opening than the entrance, which was low, and closed by an\nenormous iron door. Nevertheless, light was not lacking; a furnace had\nbeen constructed in the thickness of the wall; a large fire was lighted\nthere, which filled the vault with its crimson reflections and deprived\na miserable candle, which stood in one corner, of all radiance. The iron\ngrating which served to close the oven, being raised at that moment,\nallowed only a view at the mouth of the flaming vent-hole in the dark\nwall, the lower extremity of its bars, like a row of black and pointed\nteeth, set flat apart; which made the furnace resemble one of those\nmouths of dragons which spout forth flames in ancient legends. By the\nlight which escaped from it, the prisoner beheld, all about the room,\nfrightful instruments whose use she did not understand. In the centre\nlay a leather mattress, placed almost flat upon the ground, over which\nhung a strap provided with a buckle, attached to a brass ring in the\nmouth of a flat-nosed monster carved in the keystone of the vault.\nTongs, pincers, large ploughshares, filled the interior of the furnace,\nand glowed in a confused heap on the coals. The sanguine light of the\nfurnace illuminated in the chamber only a confused mass of horrible\nthings.\n\nThis Tartarus was called simply, The Question Chamber.\n\nOn the bed, in a negligent attitude, sat Pierrat Torterue, the official\ntorturer. His underlings, two gnomes with square faces, leather aprons,\nand linen breeches, were moving the iron instruments on the coals.\n\nIn vain did the poor girl summon up her courage; on entering this\nchamber she was stricken with horror.\n\nThe sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side,\nthe priests of the officiality on the other. A clerk, inkhorn, and a\ntable were in one corner.\n\nMaster Jacques Charmolue approached the gypsy with a very sweet smile.\n\n\"My dear child,\" said he, \"do you still persist in your denial?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, in a dying voice.\n\n\"In that case,\" replied Charmolue, \"it will be very painful for us to\nhave to question you more urgently than we should like. Pray take the\ntrouble to seat yourself on this bed. Master Pierrat, make room for\nmademoiselle, and close the door.\"\n\nPierrat rose with a growl.\n\n\"If I shut the door,\" he muttered, \"my fire will go out.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear fellow,\" replied Charmolue, \"leave it open then.\"\n\nMeanwhile, la Esmeralda had remained standing. That leather bed on which\nso many unhappy wretches had writhed, frightened her. Terror chilled the\nvery marrow of her bones; she stood there bewildered and stupefied. At\na sign from Charmolue, the two assistants took her and placed her in\na sitting posture on the bed. They did her no harm; but when these\nmen touched her, when that leather touched her, she felt all her blood\nretreat to her heart. She cast a frightened look around the chamber. It\nseemed to her as though she beheld advancing from all quarters towards\nher, with the intention of crawling up her body and biting and pinching\nher, all those hideous implements of torture, which as compared to the\ninstruments of all sorts she had hitherto seen, were like what bats,\ncentipedes, and spiders are among insects and birds.\n\n\"Where is the physician?\" asked Charmolue.\n\n\"Here,\" replied a black gown whom she had not before noticed.\n\nShe shuddered.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" resumed the caressing voice of the procucrator of the\nEcclesiastical court, \"for the third time, do you persist in denying the\ndeeds of which you are accused?\"\n\nThis time she could only make a sign with her head.\n\n\"You persist?\" said Jacques Charmolue. \"Then it grieves me deeply, but I\nmust fulfil my office.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le Procureur du Roi,\" said Pierrat abruptly, \"How shall we\nbegin?\"\n\nCharmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous grimace of a poet in\nsearch of a rhyme.\n\n\"With the boot,\" he said at last.\n\nThe unfortunate girl felt herself so utterly abandoned by God and men,\nthat her head fell upon her breast like an inert thing which has no\npower in itself.\n\nThe tormentor and the physician approached her simultaneously. At\nthe same time, the two assistants began to fumble among their hideous\narsenal.\n\nAt the clanking of their frightful irons, the unhappy child quivered\nlike a dead frog which is being galvanized. \"Oh!\" she murmured, so low\nthat no one heard her; \"Oh, my Phoebus!\" Then she fell back once more\ninto her immobility and her marble silence. This spectacle would have\nrent any other heart than those of her judges. One would have pronounced\nher a poor sinful soul, being tortured by Satan beneath the scarlet\nwicket of hell. The miserable body which that frightful swarm of saws,\nwheels, and racks were about to clasp in their clutches, the being\nwho was about to be manipulated by the harsh hands of executioners\nand pincers, was that gentle, white, fragile creature, a poor grain of\nmillet which human justice was handing over to the terrible mills of\ntorture to grind. Meanwhile, the callous hands of Pierrat Torterue's\nassistants had bared that charming leg, that tiny foot, which had so\noften amazed the passers-by with their delicacy and beauty, in the\nsquares of Paris.\n\n\"'Tis a shame!\" muttered the tormentor, glancing at these graceful and\ndelicate forms.\n\nHad the archdeacon been present, he certainly would have recalled at\nthat moment his symbol of the spider and the fly. Soon the unfortunate\ngirl, through a mist which spread before her eyes, beheld the boot\napproach; she soon beheld her foot encased between iron plates disappear\nin the frightful apparatus. Then terror restored her strength.\n\n\"Take that off!\" she cried angrily; and drawing herself up, with her\nhair all dishevelled: \"Mercy!\"\n\nShe darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king's\nprocurator, but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and iron, and\nshe sank down upon the boot, more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead\non its wing.\n\nAt a sign from Charmolue, she was replaced on the bed, and two coarse\nhands adjusted to her delicate waist the strap which hung from the\nceiling.\n\n\"For the last time, do you confess the facts in the case?\" demanded\nCharmolue, with his imperturbable benignity.\n\n\"I am innocent.\"\n\n\"Then, mademoiselle, how do you explain the circumstance laid to your\ncharge?\"\n\n\"Alas, monseigneur, I do not know.\"\n\n\"So you deny them?\"\n\n\"All!\"\n\n\"Proceed,\" said Charmolue to Pierrat.\n\nPierrat turned the handle of the screw-jack, the boot was contracted,\nand the unhappy girl uttered one of those horrible cries which have no\northography in any human language.\n\n\"Stop!\" said Charmolue to Pierrat. \"Do you confess?\" he said to the\ngypsy.\n\n\"All!\" cried the wretched girl. \"I confess! I confess! Mercy!\"\n\nShe had not calculated her strength when she faced the torture. Poor\nchild, whose life up to that time had been so joyous, so pleasant, so\nsweet, the first pain had conquered her!\n\n\"Humanity forces me to tell you,\" remarked the king's procurator, \"that\nin confessing, it is death that you must expect.\"\n\n\"I certainly hope so!\" said she. And she fell back upon the leather bed,\ndying, doubled up, allowing herself to hang suspended from the strap\nbuckled round her waist.\n\n\"Come, fair one, hold up a little,\" said Master Pierrat, raising her.\n\"You have the air of the lamb of the Golden Fleece which hangs from\nMonsieur de Bourgogne's neck.\"\n\nJacques Charmolue raised his voice,\n\n\"Clerk, write. Young Bohemian maid, you confess your participation in\nthe feasts, witches' sabbaths, and witchcrafts of hell, with ghosts,\nhags, and vampires? Answer.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, so low that her words were lost in her breathing.\n\n\"You confess to having seen the ram which Beelzebub causes to appear in\nthe clouds to call together the witches' sabbath, and which is beheld by\nsocerers alone?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You confess to having adored the heads of Bophomet, those abominable\nidols of the Templars?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"To having had habitual dealings with the devil under the form of a goat\nfamiliar, joined with you in the suit?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Lastly, you avow and confess to having, with the aid of the demon, and\nof the phantom vulgarly known as the surly monk, on the night of the\ntwenty-ninth of March last, murdered and assassinated a captain named\nPhoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers?\"\n\nShe raised her large, staring eyes to the magistrate, and replied, as\nthough mechanically, without convulsion or agitation,--\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nIt was evident that everything within her was broken.\n\n\"Write, clerk,\" said Charmolue. And, addressing the torturers, \"Release\nthe prisoner, and take her back to the court.\"\n\nWhen the prisoner had been \"unbooted,\" the procurator of the\necclesiastical court examined her foot, which was still swollen with\npain. \"Come,\" said he, \"there's no great harm done. You shrieked in good\nseason. You could still dance, my beauty!\"\n\nThen he turned to his acolytes of the officiality,--\"Behold justice\nenlightened at last! This is a solace, gentlemen! Madamoiselle will bear\nus witness that we have acted with all possible gentleness.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. END OF THE CROWN WHICH WAS TURNED INTO A DRY LEAF.\n\n\n\nWhen she re-entered the audience hall, pale and limping, she was\nreceived with a general murmur of pleasure. On the part of the audience\nthere was the feeling of impatience gratified which one experiences at\nthe theatre at the end of the last entr'acte of the comedy, when the\ncurtain rises and the conclusion is about to begin. On the part of the\njudges, it was the hope of getting their suppers sooner.\n\nThe little goat also bleated with joy. He tried to run towards his\nmistress, but they had tied him to the bench.\n\nNight was fully set in. The candles, whose number had not been\nincreased, cast so little light, that the walls of the hall could not be\nseen. The shadows there enveloped all objects in a sort of mist. A few\napathetic faces of judges alone could be dimly discerned. Opposite them,\nat the extremity of the long hail, they could see a vaguely white point\nstanding out against the sombre background. This was the accused.\n\nShe had dragged herself to her place. When Charmolue had installed\nhimself in a magisterial manner in his own, he seated himself, then\nrose and said, without exhibiting too much self-complacency at his\nsuccess,--\"The accused has confessed all.\"\n\n\"Bohemian girl,\" the president continued, \"have you avowed all\nyour deeds of magic, prostitution, and assassination on Phoebus de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers.\"\n\nHer heart contracted. She was heard to sob amid the darkness.\n\n\"Anything you like,\" she replied feebly, \"but kill me quickly!\"\n\n\"Monsieur, procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical courts,\" said\nthe president, \"the chamber is ready to hear you in your charge.\"\n\nMaster Charmolue exhibited an alarming note book, and began to read,\nwith many gestures and the exaggerated accentuation of the pleader, an\noration in Latin, wherein all the proofs of the suit were piled up\nin Ciceronian periphrases, flanked with quotations from Plautus, his\nfavorite comic author. We regret that we are not able to offer to our\nreaders this remarkable piece. The orator pronounced it with marvellous\naction. Before he had finished the exordium, the perspiration was\nstarting from his brow, and his eyes from his bead.\n\nAll at once, in the middle of a fine period, he interrupted himself, and\nhis glance, ordinarily so gentle and even stupid, became menacing.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he exclaimed (this time in French, for it was not in\nhis copy book), \"Satan is so mixed up in this affair, that here he is\npresent at our debates, and making sport of their majesty. Behold!\"\n\nSo saying, he pointed to the little goat, who, on seeing Charmolue\ngesticulating, had, in point of fact, thought it appropriate to do the\nsame, and had seated himself on his haunches, reproducing to the best\nof his ability, with his forepaws and his bearded head the pathetic\npantomine of the king's procurator in the ecclesiastical court. This\nwas, if the reader remembers, one of his prettiest accomplishments. This\nincident, this last proof, produced a great effect. The goat's\nhoofs were tied, and the king's procurator resumed the thread of his\neloquence.\n\nIt was very long, but the peroration was admirable. Here is the\nconcluding phrase; let the reader add the hoarse voice and the\nbreathless gestures of Master Charmolue,\n\n\"_Ideo, domni, coram stryga demonstrata, crimine patente, intentione\ncriminis existente, in nornine sanctoe ecclesioe Nostroe-Domince\nParisiensis qu\u00c3\u00a6 est in saisina habendi omnimodam altam et bassam\njustitiam in illa hac intemerata Civitatis insula, tenore proesentium\ndeclaremus nos requirere, primo, aliquamdam pecuniariam indemnitatem;\nsecundo, amendationem honorabilem ante portalium maximum\nNostroe-Dominoe, ecclesioe cathedralis; tertio, sententiani in virtute\ncujus ista styrga cum sua capella, seu in trivio vulgariter dicto_ la\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve, _seu in insula exeunte in fluvio Secanoe, juxta pointam juardini\nregalis, executatoe sint_!\"*\n\n\n     * The substance of this exordium is contained in the president's\nsentence.\n\n\nHe put on his cap again and seated himself.\n\n\"Eheu!\" sighed the broken-hearted Gringoire, \"_bassa latinitas_--bastard\nlatin!\"\n\nAnother man in a black gown rose near the accused; he was her\nlawyer.--The judges, who were fasting, began to grumble.\n\n\"Advocate, be brief,\" said the president.\n\n\"Monsieur the President,\" replied the advocate, \"since the defendant\nhas confessed the crime, I have only one word to say to these gentlemen.\nHere is a text from the Salic law; 'If a witch hath eaten a man, and if\nshe be convicted of it, she shall pay a fine of eight thousand deniers,\nwhich amount to two hundred sous of gold.' May it please the chamber to\ncondemn my client to the fine?\"\n\n\"An abrogated text,\" said the advocate extraordinary of the king.\n\n\"Nego, I deny it,\" replied the advocate.\n\n\"Put it to the vote!\" said one of the councillors; \"the crime is\nmanifest, and it is late.\"\n\nThey proceeded to take a vote without leaving the room. The judges\nsignified their assent without giving their reasons, they were in a\nhurry. Their capped heads were seen uncovering one after the other, in\nthe gloom, at the lugubrious question addressed to them by the president\nin a low voice. The poor accused had the appearance of looking at them,\nbut her troubled eye no longer saw.\n\nThen the clerk began to write; then he handed a long parch-ment to the\npresident.\n\nThen the unhappy girl heard the people moving, the pikes clashing, and a\nfreezing voice saying to her,--\"Bohemian wench, on the day when it shall\nseem good to our lord the king, at the hour of noon, you will be taken\nin a tumbrel, in your shift, with bare feet, and a rope about your\nneck, before the grand portal of Notre-Dame, and you will there make an\napology with a wax torch of the weight of two pounds in your hand, and\nthence you will be conducted to the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, where you will be\nhanged and strangled on the town gibbet; and likewise your goat; and\nyou will pay to the official three lions of gold, in reparation of the\ncrimes by you committed and by you confessed, of sorcery and magic,\ndebauchery and murder, upon the person of the Sieur Phoebus de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers. May God have mercy on your soul!\"\n\n\"Oh! 'tis a dream!\" she murmured; and she felt rough hands bearing her\naway.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. _LASCIATE OGNI SPERANZA_--LEAVE ALL HOPE BEHIND, YE WHO\nENTER HERE.\n\n\n\nIn the Middle Ages, when an edifice was complete, there was almost\nas much of it in the earth as above it. Unless built upon piles, like\nNotre-Dame, a palace, a fortress, a church, had always a double bottom.\nIn cathedrals, it was, in some sort, another subterranean cathedral,\nlow, dark, mysterious, blind, and mute, under the upper nave which was\noverflowing with light and reverberating with organs and bells day and\nnight. Sometimes it was a sepulchre. In palaces, in fortresses, it was\na prison, sometimes a sepulchre also, sometimes both together. These\nmighty buildings, whose mode of formation and vegetation we have\nelsewhere explained, had not simply foundations, but, so to speak,\nroots which ran branching through the soil in chambers, galleries,\nand staircases, like the construction above. Thus churches, palaces,\nfortresses, had the earth half way up their bodies. The cellars of an\nedifice formed another edifice, into which one descended instead\nof ascending, and which extended its subterranean grounds under the\nexternal piles of the monument, like those forests and mountains which\nare reversed in the mirror-like waters of a lake, beneath the forests\nand mountains of the banks.\n\nAt the fortress of Saint-Antoine, at the Palais de Justice of Paris,\nat the Louvre, these subterranean edifices were prisons. The stories of\nthese prisons, as they sank into the soil, grew constantly narrower and\nmore gloomy. They were so many zones, where the shades of horror were\ngraduated. Dante could never imagine anything better for his hell. These\ntunnels of cells usually terminated in a sack of a lowest dungeon, with\na vat-like bottom, where Dante placed Satan, where society placed those\ncondemned to death. A miserable human existence, once interred there;\nfarewell light, air, life, _ogni speranza_--every hope; it only came\nforth to the scaffold or the stake. Sometimes it rotted there; human\njustice called this \"forgetting.\" Between men and himself, the condemned\nman felt a pile of stones and jailers weighing down upon his head;\nand the entire prison, the massive bastille was nothing more than an\nenormous, complicated lock, which barred him off from the rest of the\nworld.\n\nIt was in a sloping cavity of this description, in the _oubliettes_\nexcavated by Saint-Louis, in the _inpace_ of the Tournelle, that la\nEsmeralda had been placed on being condemned to death, through fear of\nher escape, no doubt, with the colossal court-house over her head. Poor\nfly, who could not have lifted even one of its blocks of stone!\n\nAssuredly, Providence and society had been equally unjust; such an\nexcess of unhappiness and of torture was not necessary to break so frail\na creature.\n\nThere she lay, lost in the shadows, buried, hidden, immured. Any one\nwho could have beheld her in this state, after having seen her laugh and\ndance in the sun, would have shuddered. Cold as night, cold as death,\nnot a breath of air in her tresses, not a human sound in her ear,\nno longer a ray of light in her eyes; snapped in twain, crushed with\nchains, crouching beside a jug and a loaf, on a little straw, in a\npool of water, which was formed under her by the sweating of the prison\nwalls; without motion, almost without breath, she had no longer the\npower to suffer; Phoebus, the sun, midday, the open air, the streets of\nParis, the dances with applause, the sweet babblings of love with the\nofficer; then the priest, the old crone, the poignard, the blood,\nthe torture, the gibbet; all this did, indeed, pass before her mind,\nsometimes as a charming and golden vision, sometimes as a hideous\nnightmare; but it was no longer anything but a vague and horrible\nstruggle, lost in the gloom, or distant music played up above ground,\nand which was no longer audible at the depth where the unhappy girl had\nfallen.\n\nSince she had been there, she had neither waked nor slept. In that\nmisfortune, in that cell, she could no longer distinguish her waking\nhours from slumber, dreams from reality, any more than day from night.\nAll this was mixed, broken, floating, disseminated confusedly in her\nthought. She no longer felt, she no longer knew, she no longer thought;\nat the most, she only dreamed. Never had a living creature been thrust\nmore deeply into nothingness.\n\nThus benumbed, frozen, petrified, she had barely noticed on two or three\noccasions, the sound of a trap door opening somewhere above her, without\neven permitting the passage of a little light, and through which a hand\nhad tossed her a bit of black bread. Nevertheless, this periodical\nvisit of the jailer was the sole communication which was left her with\nmankind.\n\nA single thing still mechanically occupied her ear; above her head, the\ndampness was filtering through the mouldy stones of the vault, and\na drop of water dropped from them at regular intervals. She listened\nstupidly to the noise made by this drop of water as it fell into the\npool beside her.\n\nThis drop of water falling from time to time into that pool, was the\nonly movement which still went on around her, the only clock which\nmarked the time, the only noise which reached her of all the noise made\non the surface of the earth.\n\nTo tell the whole, however, she also felt, from time to time, in that\ncesspool of mire and darkness, something cold passing over her foot or\nher arm, and she shuddered.\n\nHow long had she been there? She did not know. She had a recollection\nof a sentence of death pronounced somewhere, against some one, then\nof having been herself carried away, and of waking up in darkness and\nsilence, chilled to the heart. She had dragged herself along on her\nhands. Then iron rings that cut her ankles, and chains had rattled. She\nhad recognized the fact that all around her was wall, that below her\nthere was a pavement covered with moisture and a truss of straw; but\nneither lamp nor air-hole. Then she had seated herself on that straw\nand, sometimes, for the sake of changing her attitude, on the last\nstone step in her dungeon. For a while she had tried to count the black\nminutes measured off for her by the drop of water; but that melancholy\nlabor of an ailing brain had broken off of itself in her head, and had\nleft her in stupor.\n\nAt length, one day, or one night, (for midnight and midday were of the\nsame color in that sepulchre), she heard above her a louder noise than\nwas usually made by the turnkey when he brought her bread and jug of\nwater. She raised her head, and beheld a ray of reddish light passing\nthrough the crevices in the sort of trapdoor contrived in the roof of\nthe _inpace_.\n\nAt the same time, the heavy lock creaked, the trap grated on its rusty\nhinges, turned, and she beheld a lantern, a hand, and the lower portions\nof the bodies of two men, the door being too low to admit of her seeing\ntheir heads. The light pained her so acutely that she shut her eyes.\n\nWhen she opened them again the door was closed, the lantern was\ndeposited on one of the steps of the staircase; a man alone stood before\nher. A monk's black cloak fell to his feet, a cowl of the same color\nconcealed his face. Nothing was visible of his person, neither face nor\nhands. It was a long, black shroud standing erect, and beneath which\nsomething could be felt moving. She gazed fixedly for several minutes\nat this sort of spectre. But neither he nor she spoke. One would have\npronounced them two statues confronting each other. Two things only\nseemed alive in that cavern; the wick of the lantern, which sputtered\non account of the dampness of the atmosphere, and the drop of water\nfrom the roof, which cut this irregular sputtering with its monotonous\nsplash, and made the light of the lantern quiver in concentric waves on\nthe oily water of the pool.\n\nAt last the prisoner broke the silence.\n\n\"Who are you?\"\n\n\"A priest.\"\n\nThe words, the accent, the sound of his voice made her tremble.\n\nThe priest continued, in a hollow voice,--\n\n\"Are you prepared?\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"To die.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said she, \"will it be soon?\"\n\n\"To-morrow.\"\n\nHer head, which had been raised with joy, fell back upon her breast.\n\n\"'Tis very far away yet!\" she murmured; \"why could they not have done it\nto-day?\"\n\n\"Then you are very unhappy?\" asked the priest, after a silence.\n\n\"I am very cold,\" she replied.\n\nShe took her feet in her hands, a gesture habitual with unhappy wretches\nwho are cold, as we have already seen in the case of the recluse of the\nTour-Roland, and her teeth chattered.\n\nThe priest appeared to cast his eyes around the dungeon from beneath his\ncowl.\n\n\"Without light! without fire! in the water! it is horrible!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied, with the bewildered air which unhappiness had given\nher. \"The day belongs to every one, why do they give me only night?\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" resumed the priest, after a fresh silence, \"why you are\nhere?\"\n\n\"I thought I knew once,\" she said, passing her thin fingers over her\neyelids, as though to aid her memory, \"but I know no longer.\"\n\nAll at once she began to weep like a child.\n\n\"I should like to get away from here, sir. I am cold, I am afraid, and\nthere are creatures which crawl over my body.\"\n\n\"Well, follow me.\"\n\nSo saying, the priest took her arm. The unhappy girl was frozen to her\nvery soul. Yet that hand produced an impression of cold upon her.\n\n\"Oh!\" she murmured, \"'tis the icy hand of death. Who are you?\"\n\nThe priest threw back his cowl; she looked. It was the sinister visage\nwhich had so long pursued her; that demon's head which had appeared at\nla Falourdel's, above the head of her adored Phoebus; that eye which she\nlast had seen glittering beside a dagger.\n\nThis apparition, always so fatal for her, and which had thus driven her\non from misfortune to misfortune, even to torture, roused her from her\nstupor. It seemed to her that the sort of veil which had lain thick upon\nher memory was rent away. All the details of her melancholy adventure,\nfrom the nocturnal scene at la Falourdel's to her condemnation to the\nTournelle, recurred to her memory, no longer vague and confused as\nheretofore, but distinct, harsh, clear, palpitating, terrible. These\nsouvenirs, half effaced and almost obliterated by excess of suffering,\nwere revived by the sombre figure which stood before her, as the\napproach of fire causes letters traced upon white paper with invisible\nink, to start out perfectly fresh. It seemed to her that all the wounds\nof her heart opened and bled simultaneously.\n\n\"Hah!\" she cried, with her hands on her eyes, and a convulsive\ntrembling, \"'tis the priest!\"\n\nThen she dropped her arms in discouragement, and remained seated, with\nlowered head, eyes fixed on the ground, mute and still trembling.\n\nThe priest gazed at her with the eye of a hawk which has long been\nsoaring in a circle from the heights of heaven over a poor lark cowering\nin the wheat, and has long been silently contracting the formidable\ncircles of his flight, and has suddenly swooped down upon his prey like\na flash of lightning, and holds it panting in his talons.\n\nShe began to murmur in a low voice,--\n\n\"Finish! finish! the last blow!\" and she drew her head down in terror\nbetween her shoulders, like the lamb awaiting the blow of the butcher's\naxe.\n\n\"So I inspire you with horror?\" he said at length.\n\nShe made no reply.\n\n\"Do I inspire you with horror?\" he repeated.\n\nHer lips contracted, as though with a smile.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, \"the headsman scoffs at the condemned. Here he has been\npursuing me, threatening me, terrifying me for months! Had it not been\nfor him, my God, how happy it should have been! It was he who cast me\ninto this abyss! Oh heavens! it was he who killed him! my Phoebus!\"\n\nHere, bursting into sobs, and raising her eyes to the priest,--\n\n\"Oh! wretch, who are you? What have I done to you? Do you then, hate me\nso? Alas! what have you against me?\"\n\n\"I love thee!\" cried the priest.\n\nHer tears suddenly ceased, she gazed at him with the look of an idiot.\nHe had fallen on his knees and was devouring her with eyes of flame.\n\n\"Dost thou understand? I love thee!\" he cried again.\n\n\"What love!\" said the unhappy girl with a shudder.\n\nHe resumed,--\n\n\"The love of a damned soul.\"\n\nBoth remained silent for several minutes, crushed beneath the weight of\ntheir emotions; he maddened, she stupefied.\n\n\"Listen,\" said the priest at last, and a singular calm had come over\nhim; \"you shall know all I am about to tell you that which I have\nhitherto hardly dared to say to myself, when furtively interrogating my\nconscience at those deep hours of the night when it is so dark that it\nseems as though God no longer saw us. Listen. Before I knew you, young\ngirl, I was happy.\"\n\n\"So was I!\" she sighed feebly.\n\n\"Do not interrupt me. Yes, I was happy, at least I believed myself to be\nso. I was pure, my soul was filled with limpid light. No head was raised\nmore proudly and more radiantly than mine. Priests consulted me on\nchastity; doctors, on doctrines. Yes, science was all in all to me; it\nwas a sister to me, and a sister sufficed. Not but that with age other\nideas came to me. More than once my flesh had been moved as a woman's\nform passed by. That force of sex and blood which, in the madness of\nyouth, I had imagined that I had stifled forever had, more than once,\nconvulsively raised the chain of iron vows which bind me, a miserable\nwretch, to the cold stones of the altar. But fasting, prayer, study,\nthe mortifications of the cloister, rendered my soul mistress of my body\nonce more, and then I avoided women. Moreover, I had but to open a book,\nand all the impure mists of my brain vanished before the splendors of\nscience. In a few moments, I felt the gross things of earth flee far\naway, and I found myself once more calm, quieted, and serene, in the\npresence of the tranquil radiance of eternal truth. As long as the demon\nsent to attack me only vague shadows of women who passed occasionally\nbefore my eyes in church, in the streets, in the fields, and who hardly\nrecurred to my dreams, I easily vanquished him. Alas! if the victory has\nnot remained with me, it is the fault of God, who has not created man\nand the demon of equal force. Listen. One day--\"\n\nHere the priest paused, and the prisoner heard sighs of anguish break\nfrom his breast with a sound of the death rattle.\n\nHe resumed,--\n\n\"One day I was leaning on the window of my cell. What book was I reading\nthen? Oh! all that is a whirlwind in my head. I was reading. The window\nopened upon a Square. I heard a sound of tambourine and music. Annoyed\nat being thus disturbed in my revery, I glanced into the Square. What\nI beheld, others saw beside myself, and yet it was not a spectacle made\nfor human eyes. There, in the middle of the pavement,--it was midday,\nthe sun was shining brightly,--a creature was dancing. A creature so\nbeautiful that God would have preferred her to the Virgin and have\nchosen her for his mother and have wished to be born of her if she\nhad been in existence when he was made man! Her eyes were black and\nsplendid; in the midst of her black locks, some hairs through which the\nsun shone glistened like threads of gold. Her feet disappeared in their\nmovements like the spokes of a rapidly turning wheel. Around her head,\nin her black tresses, there were disks of metal, which glittered in the\nsun, and formed a coronet of stars on her brow. Her dress thick set with\nspangles, blue, and dotted with a thousand sparks, gleamed like a summer\nnight. Her brown, supple arms twined and untwined around her waist, like\ntwo scarfs. The form of her body was surprisingly beautiful. Oh! what\na resplendent figure stood out, like something luminous even in the\nsunlight! Alas, young girl, it was thou! Surprised, intoxicated,\ncharmed, I allowed myself to gaze upon thee. I looked so long that I\nsuddenly shuddered with terror; I felt that fate was seizing hold of\nme.\"\n\nThe priest paused for a moment, overcome with emotion. Then he\ncontinued,--\n\n\"Already half fascinated, I tried to cling fast to something and hold\nmyself back from falling. I recalled the snares which Satan had already\nset for me. The creature before my eyes possessed that superhuman beauty\nwhich can come only from heaven or hell. It was no simple girl made with\na little of our earth, and dimly lighted within by the vacillating ray\nof a woman's soul. It was an angel! but of shadows and flame, and not of\nlight. At the moment when I was meditating thus, I beheld beside you a\ngoat, a beast of witches, which smiled as it gazed at me. The midday sun\ngave him golden horns. Then I perceived the snare of the demon, and I no\nlonger doubted that you had come from hell and that you had come thence\nfor my perdition. I believed it.\"\n\nHere the priest looked the prisoner full in the face, and added,\ncoldly,--\n\n\"I believe it still. Nevertheless, the charm operated little by little;\nyour dancing whirled through my brain; I felt the mysterious spell\nworking within me. All that should have awakened was lulled to sleep;\nand like those who die in the snow, I felt pleasure in allowing this\nsleep to draw on. All at once, you began to sing. What could I do,\nunhappy wretch? Your song was still more charming than your dancing. I\ntried to flee. Impossible. I was nailed, rooted to the spot. It seemed\nto me that the marble of the pavement had risen to my knees. I was\nforced to remain until the end. My feet were like ice, my head was on\nfire. At last you took pity on me, you ceased to sing, you disappeared.\nThe reflection of the dazzling vision, the reverberation of the\nenchanting music disappeared by degrees from my eyes and my ears. Then I\nfell back into the embrasure of the window, more rigid, more feeble than\na statue torn from its base. The vesper bell roused me. I drew myself\nup; I fled; but alas! something within me had fallen never to rise\nagain, something had come upon me from which I could not flee.\"\n\nHe made another pause and went on,--\n\n\"Yes, dating from that day, there was within me a man whom I did not\nknow. I tried to make use of all my remedies. The cloister, the altar,\nwork, books,--follies! Oh, how hollow does science sound when one in\ndespair dashes against it a head full of passions! Do you know, young\ngirl, what I saw thenceforth between my book and me? You, your shade,\nthe image of the luminous apparition which had one day crossed the space\nbefore me. But this image had no longer the same color; it was sombre,\nfunereal, gloomy as the black circle which long pursues the vision of\nthe imprudent man who has gazed intently at the sun.\n\n\"Unable to rid myself of it, since I heard your song humming ever in\nmy head, beheld your feet dancing always on my breviary, felt even at\nnight, in my dreams, your form in contact with my own, I desired to see\nyou again, to touch you, to know who you were, to see whether I should\nreally find you like the ideal image which I had retained of you, to\nshatter my dream, perchance, with reality. At all events, I hoped that\na new impression would efface the first, and the first had become\ninsupportable. I sought you. I saw you once more. Calamity! When I had\nseen you twice, I wanted to see you a thousand times, I wanted to see\nyou always. Then--how stop myself on that slope of hell?--then I no\nlonger belonged to myself. The other end of the thread which the demon\nhad attached to my wings he had fastened to his foot. I became vagrant\nand wandering like yourself. I waited for you under porches, I stood on\nthe lookout for you at the street corners, I watched for you from the\nsummit of my tower. Every evening I returned to myself more charmed,\nmore despairing, more bewitched, more lost!\n\n\"I had learned who you were; an Egyptian, Bohemian, gypsy, zingara. How\ncould I doubt the magic? Listen. I hoped that a trial would free me from\nthe charm. A witch enchanted Bruno d'Ast; he had her burned, and was\ncured. I knew it. I wanted to try the remedy. First I tried to have you\nforbidden the square in front of Notre-Dame, hoping to forget you if you\nreturned no more. You paid no heed to it. You returned. Then the idea of\nabducting you occurred to me. One night I made the attempt. There were\ntwo of us. We already had you in our power, when that miserable officer\ncame up. He delivered you. Thus did he begin your unhappiness, mine, and\nhis own. Finally, no longer knowing what to do, and what was to become\nof me, I denounced you to the official.\n\n\"I thought that I should be cured like Bruno d'Ast. I also had a\nconfused idea that a trial would deliver you into my hands; that, as a\nprisoner I should hold you, I should have you; that there you could not\nescape from me; that you had already possessed me a sufficiently long\ntime to give me the right to possess you in my turn. When one does\nwrong, one must do it thoroughly. 'Tis madness to halt midway in the\nmonstrous! The extreme of crime has its deliriums of joy. A priest and a\nwitch can mingle in delight upon the truss of straw in a dungeon!\n\n\"Accordingly, I denounced you. It was then that I terrified you when\nwe met. The plot which I was weaving against you, the storm which I\nwas heaping up above your head, burst from me in threats and lightning\nglances. Still, I hesitated. My project had its terrible sides which\nmade me shrink back.\n\n\"Perhaps I might have renounced it; perhaps my hideous thought would\nhave withered in my brain, without bearing fruit. I thought that\nit would always depend upon me to follow up or discontinue this\nprosecution. But every evil thought is inexorable, and insists on\nbecoming a deed; but where I believed myself to be all powerful, fate\nwas more powerful than I. Alas! 'tis fate which has seized you and\ndelivered you to the terrible wheels of the machine which I had\nconstructed doubly. Listen. I am nearing the end.\n\n\"One day,--again the sun was shining brilliantly--I behold man pass me\nuttering your name and laughing, who carries sensuality in his eyes.\nDamnation! I followed him; you know the rest.\"\n\nHe ceased.\n\nThe young girl could find but one word:\n\n\"Oh, my Phoebus!\"\n\n\"Not that name!\" said the priest, grasping her arm violently. \"Utter not\nthat name! Oh! miserable wretches that we are, 'tis that name which has\nruined us! or, rather we have ruined each other by the inexplicable play\nof fate! you are suffering, are you not? you are cold; the night makes\nyou blind, the dungeon envelops you; but perhaps you still have some\nlight in the bottom of your soul, were it only your childish love for\nthat empty man who played with your heart, while I bear the dungeon\nwithin me; within me there is winter, ice, despair; I have night in my\nsoul.\n\n\"Do you know what I have suffered? I was present at your trial. I was\nseated on the official's bench. Yes, under one of the priests' cowls,\nthere were the contortions of the damned. When you were brought in, I\nwas there; when you were questioned, I was there.--Den of wolves!--It\nwas my crime, it was my gallows that I beheld being slowly reared over\nyour head. I was there for every witness, every proof, every plea; I\ncould count each of your steps in the painful path; I was still there\nwhen that ferocious beast--oh! I had not foreseen torture! Listen.\nI followed you to that chamber of anguish. I beheld you stripped and\nhandled, half naked, by the infamous hands of the tormentor. I beheld\nyour foot, that foot which I would have given an empire to kiss and die,\nthat foot, beneath which to have had my head crushed I should have felt\nsuch rapture,--I beheld it encased in that horrible boot, which converts\nthe limbs of a living being into one bloody clod. Oh, wretch! while\nI looked on at that, I held beneath my shroud a dagger, with which I\nlacerated my breast. When you uttered that cry, I plunged it into my\nflesh; at a second cry, it would have entered my heart. Look! I believe\nthat it still bleeds.\"\n\nHe opened his cassock. His breast was in fact, mangled as by the claw of\na tiger, and on his side he had a large and badly healed wound.\n\nThe prisoner recoiled with horror.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the priest, \"young girl, have pity upon me! You think\nyourself unhappy; alas! alas! you know not what unhappiness is. Oh! to\nlove a woman! to be a priest! to be hated! to love with all the fury\nof one's soul; to feel that one would give for the least of her\nsmiles, one's blood, one's vitals, one's fame, one's salvation, one's\nimmortality and eternity, this life and the other; to regret that one\nis not a king, emperor, archangel, God, in order that one might place\na greater slave beneath her feet; to clasp her night and day in one's\ndreams and one's thoughts, and to behold her in love with the trappings\nof a soldier and to have nothing to offer her but a priest's dirty\ncassock, which will inspire her with fear and disgust! To be present\nwith one's jealousy and one's rage, while she lavishes on a miserable,\nblustering imbecile, treasures of love and beauty! To behold that body\nwhose form burns you, that bosom which possesses so much sweetness, that\nflesh palpitate and blush beneath the kisses of another! Oh heaven! to\nlove her foot, her arm, her shoulder, to think of her blue veins, of her\nbrown skin, until one writhes for whole nights together on the pavement\nof one's cell, and to behold all those caresses which one has dreamed\nof, end in torture! To have succeeded only in stretching her upon the\nleather bed! Oh! these are the veritable pincers, reddened in the fires\nof hell. Oh! blessed is he who is sawn between two planks, or torn\nin pieces by four horses! Do you know what that torture is, which is\nimposed upon you for long nights by your burning arteries, your bursting\nheart, your breaking head, your teeth-knawed hands; mad tormentors which\nturn you incessantly, as upon a red-hot gridiron, to a thought of love,\nof jealousy, and of despair! Young girl, mercy! a truce for a moment!\na few ashes on these live coals! Wipe away, I beseech you, the\nperspiration which trickles in great drops from my brow! Child! torture\nme with one hand, but caress me with the other! Have pity, young girl!\nHave pity upon me!\"\n\nThe priest writhed on the wet pavement, beating his head against the\ncorners of the stone steps. The young girl gazed at him, and listened to\nhim.\n\nWhen he ceased, exhausted and panting, she repeated in a low voice,--\n\n\"Oh my Phoebus!\"\n\nThe priest dragged himself towards her on his knees.\n\n\"I beseech you,\" he cried, \"if you have any heart, do not repulse me!\nOh! I love you! I am a wretch! When you utter that name, unhappy girl,\nit is as though you crushed all the fibres of my heart between your\nteeth. Mercy! If you come from hell I will go thither with you. I have\ndone everything to that end. The hell where you are, shall he paradise;\nthe sight of you is more charming than that of God! Oh! speak! you will\nhave none of me? I should have thought the mountains would be shaken in\ntheir foundations on the day when a woman would repulse such a love.\nOh! if you only would! Oh! how happy we might be. We would flee--I would\nhelp you to flee,--we would go somewhere, we would seek that spot on\nearth, where the sun is brightest, the sky the bluest, where the trees\nare most luxuriant. We would love each other, we would pour our two\nsouls into each other, and we would have a thirst for ourselves which we\nwould quench in common and incessantly at that fountain of inexhaustible\nlove.\"\n\nShe interrupted with a terrible and thrilling laugh.\n\n\"Look, father, you have blood on your fingers!\"\n\nThe priest remained for several moments as though petrified, with his\neyes fixed upon his hand.\n\n\"Well, yes!\" he resumed at last, with strange gentleness, \"insult me,\nscoff at me, overwhelm me with scorn! but come, come. Let us make haste.\nIt is to be to-morrow, I tell you. The gibbet on the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, you know it?\nit stands always ready. It is horrible! to see you ride in that tumbrel!\nOh mercy! Until now I have never felt the power of my love for you.--Oh!\nfollow me. You shall take your time to love me after I have saved you.\nYou shall hate me as long as you will. But come. To-morrow! to-morrow!\nthe gallows! your execution! Oh! save yourself! spare me!\"\n\nHe seized her arm, he was beside himself, he tried to drag her away.\n\nShe fixed her eye intently on him.\n\n\"What has become of my Phoebus?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the priest, releasing her arm, \"you are pitiless.\"\n\n\"What has become of Phoebus?\" she repeated coldly.\n\n\"He is dead!\" cried the priest.\n\n\"Dead!\" said she, still icy and motionless \"then why do you talk to me\nof living?\"\n\nHe was not listening to her.\n\n\"Oh! yes,\" said he, as though speaking to himself, \"he certainly must be\ndead. The blade pierced deeply. I believe I touched his heart with the\npoint. Oh! my very soul was at the end of the dagger!\"\n\nThe young girl flung herself upon him like a raging tigress, and pushed\nhim upon the steps of the staircase with supernatural force.\n\n\"Begone, monster! Begone, assassin! Leave me to die! May the blood\nof both of us make an eternal stain upon your brow! Be thine, priest!\nNever! never! Nothing shall unite us! not hell itself! Go, accursed man!\nNever!\"\n\nThe priest had stumbled on the stairs. He silently disentangled his\nfeet from the folds of his robe, picked up his lantern again, and slowly\nbegan the ascent of the steps which led to the door; he opened the door\nand passed through it.\n\nAll at once, the young girl beheld his head reappear; it wore a\nfrightful expression, and he cried, hoarse with rage and despair,--\n\n\"I tell you he is dead!\"\n\nShe fell face downwards upon the floor, and there was no longer any\nsound audible in the cell than the sob of the drop of water which made\nthe pool palpitate amid the darkness.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE MOTHER.\n\n\n\nI do not believe that there is anything sweeter in the world than the\nideas which awake in a mother's heart at the sight of her child's tiny\nshoe; especially if it is a shoe for festivals, for Sunday, for baptism,\nthe shoe embroidered to the very sole, a shoe in which the infant has\nnot yet taken a step. That shoe has so much grace and daintiness, it is\nso impossible for it to walk, that it seems to the mother as though she\nsaw her child. She smiles upon it, she kisses it, she talks to it; she\nasks herself whether there can actually be a foot so tiny; and if the\nchild be absent, the pretty shoe suffices to place the sweet and fragile\ncreature before her eyes. She thinks she sees it, she does see it,\ncomplete, living, joyous, with its delicate hands, its round head, its\npure lips, its serene eyes whose white is blue. If it is in winter, it\nis yonder, crawling on the carpet, it is laboriously climbing upon an\nottoman, and the mother trembles lest it should approach the fire. If it\nis summer time, it crawls about the yard, in the garden, plucks up the\ngrass between the paving-stones, gazes innocently at the big dogs, the\nbig horses, without fear, plays with the shells, with the flowers, and\nmakes the gardener grumble because he finds sand in the flower-beds and\nearth in the paths. Everything laughs, and shines and plays around it,\nlike it, even the breath of air and the ray of sun which vie with each\nother in disporting among the silky ringlets of its hair. The shoe shows\nall this to the mother, and makes her heart melt as fire melts wax.\n\nBut when the child is lost, these thousand images of joy, of charms, of\ntenderness, which throng around the little shoe, become so many\nhorrible things. The pretty broidered shoe is no longer anything but an\ninstrument of torture which eternally crushes the heart of the mother.\nIt is always the same fibre which vibrates, the tenderest and most\nsensitive; but instead of an angel caressing it, it is a demon who is\nwrenching at it.\n\nOne May morning, when the sun was rising on one of those dark blue skies\nagainst which Garofolo loves to place his Descents from the Cross, the\nrecluse of the Tour-Roland heard a sound of wheels, of horses and irons\nin the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. She was somewhat aroused by it, knotted her hair\nupon her ears in order to deafen herself, and resumed her contemplation,\non her knees, of the inanimate object which she had adored for fifteen\nyears. This little shoe was the universe to her, as we have already\nsaid. Her thought was shut up in it, and was destined never more to quit\nit except at death. The sombre cave of the Tour-Roland alone knew how\nmany bitter imprecations, touching complaints, prayers and sobs she had\nwafted to heaven in connection with that charming bauble of rose-colored\nsatin. Never was more despair bestowed upon a prettier and more graceful\nthing.\n\nIt seemed as though her grief were breaking forth more violently than\nusual; and she could be heard outside lamenting in a loud and monotonous\nvoice which rent the heart.\n\n\"Oh my daughter!\" she said, \"my daughter, my poor, dear little child, so\nI shall never see thee more! It is over! It always seems to me that it\nhappened yesterday! My God! my God! it would have been better not to\ngive her to me than to take her away so soon. Did you not know that our\nchildren are part of ourselves, and that a mother who has lost her child\nno longer believes in God? Ah! wretch that I am to have gone out that\nday! Lord! Lord! to have taken her from me thus; you could never have\nlooked at me with her, when I was joyously warming her at my fire, when\nshe laughed as she suckled, when I made her tiny feet creep up my breast\nto my lips? Oh! if you had looked at that, my God, you would have taken\npity on my joy; you would not have taken from me the only love which\nlingered, in my heart! Was I then, Lord, so miserable a creature, that\nyou could not look at me before condemning me?--Alas! Alas! here is\nthe shoe; where is the foot? where is the rest? Where is the child? My\ndaughter! my daughter! what did they do with thee? Lord, give her back\nto me. My knees have been worn for fifteen years in praying to thee,\nmy God! Is not that enough? Give her back to me one day, one hour,\none minute; one minute, Lord! and then cast me to the demon for all\neternity! Oh! if I only knew where the skirt of your garment trails, I\nwould cling to it with both hands, and you would be obliged to give me\nback my child! Have you no pity on her pretty little shoe? Could you\ncondemn a poor mother to this torture for fifteen years? Good Virgin!\ngood Virgin of heaven! my infant Jesus has been taken from me, has been\nstolen from me; they devoured her on a heath, they drank her blood, they\ncracked her bones! Good Virgin, have pity upon me. My daughter, I want\nmy daughter! What is it to me that she is in paradise? I do not want\nyour angel, I want my child! I am a lioness, I want my whelp. Oh! I will\nwrithe on the earth, I will break the stones with my forehead, and I\nwill damn myself, and I will curse you, Lord, if you keep my child from\nme! you see plainly that my arms are all bitten, Lord! Has the good God\nno mercy?--Oh! give me only salt and black bread, only let me have my\ndaughter to warm me like a sun! Alas! Lord my God. Alas! Lord my God,\nI am only a vile sinner; but my daughter made me pious. I was full of\nreligion for the love of her, and I beheld you through her smile as\nthrough an opening into heaven. Oh! if I could only once, just once\nmore, a single time, put this shoe on her pretty little pink foot, I\nwould die blessing you, good Virgin. Ah! fifteen years! she will be\ngrown up now!--Unhappy child! what! it is really true then I shall never\nsee her more, not even in heaven, for I shall not go there myself. Oh!\nwhat misery to think that here is her shoe, and that that is all!\"\n\nThe unhappy woman flung herself upon that shoe; her consolation and her\ndespair for so many years, and her vitals were rent with sobs as on the\nfirst day; because, for a mother who has lost her child, it is always\nthe first day. That grief never grows old. The mourning garments may\ngrow white and threadbare, the heart remains dark.\n\nAt that moment, the fresh and joyous cries of children passed in front\nof the cell. Every time that children crossed her vision or struck\nher ear, the poor mother flung herself into the darkest corner of her\nsepulchre, and one would have said, that she sought to plunge her head\ninto the stone in order not to hear them. This time, on the contrary,\nshe drew herself upright with a start, and listened eagerly. One of the\nlittle boys had just said,--\n\n\"They are going to hang a gypsy to-day.\"\n\nWith the abrupt leap of that spider which we have seen fling itself upon\na fly at the trembling of its web, she rushed to her air-hole, which\nopened as the reader knows, on the Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. A ladder had, in\nfact, been raised up against the permanent gibbet, and the hangman's\nassistant was busying himself with adjusting the chains which had been\nrusted by the rain. There were some people standing about.\n\nThe laughing group of children was already far away. The sacked nun\nsought with her eyes some passer-by whom she might question. All at\nonce, beside her cell, she perceived a priest making a pretext of\nreading the public breviary, but who was much less occupied with the\n\"lectern of latticed iron,\" than with the gallows, toward which he cast\na fierce and gloomy glance from time to time. She recognized monsieur\nthe archdeacon of Josas, a holy man.\n\n\"Father,\" she inquired, \"whom are they about to hang yonder?\"\n\nThe priest looked at her and made no reply; she repeated her question.\nThen he said,--\n\n\"I know not.\"\n\n\"Some children said that it was a gypsy,\" went on the recluse.\n\n\"I believe so,\" said the priest.\n\nThen Paquette la Chantefleurie burst into hyena-like laughter.\n\n\"Sister,\" said the archdeacon, \"do you then hate the gypsies heartily?\"\n\n\"Do I hate them!\" exclaimed the recluse, \"they are vampires, stealers\nof children! They devoured my little daughter, my child, my only child!\nI have no longer any heart, they devoured it!\"\n\nShe was frightful. The priest looked at her coldly.\n\n\"There is one in particular whom I hate, and whom I have cursed,\" she\nresumed; \"it is a young one, of the age which my daughter would be if\nher mother had not eaten my daughter. Every time that that young viper\npasses in front of my cell, she sets my blood in a ferment.\"\n\n\"Well, sister, rejoice,\" said the priest, icy as a sepulchral statue;\n\"that is the one whom you are about to see die.\"\n\nHis head fell upon his bosom and he moved slowly away.\n\nThe recluse writhed her arms with joy.\n\n\"I predicted it for her, that she would ascend thither! Thanks, priest!\"\nshe cried.\n\nAnd she began to pace up and down with long strides before the grating\nof her window, her hair dishevelled, her eyes flashing, with her\nshoulder striking against the wall, with the wild air of a female wolf\nin a cage, who has long been famished, and who feels the hour for her\nrepast drawing near.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. THREE HUMAN HEARTS DIFFERENTLY CONSTRUCTED.\n\n\n\nPhoebus was not dead, however. Men of that stamp die hard. When Master\nPhilippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king, had said to poor\nEsmeralda; \"He is dying,\" it was an error or a jest. When the archdeacon\nhad repeated to the condemned girl; \"He is dead,\" the fact is that he\nknew nothing about it, but that he believed it, that he counted on it,\nthat he did not doubt it, that he devoutly hoped it. It would have been\ntoo hard for him to give favorable news of his rival to the woman whom\nhe loved. Any man would have done the same in his place.\n\nIt was not that Phoebus's wound had not been serious, but it had not\nbeen as much so as the archdeacon believed. The physician, to whom the\nsoldiers of the watch had carried him at the first moment, had feared\nfor his life during the space of a week, and had even told him so in\nLatin. But youth had gained the upper hand; and, as frequently happens,\nin spite of prognostications and diagnoses, nature had amused herself by\nsaving the sick man under the physician's very nose. It was while he\nwas still lying on the leech's pallet that he had submitted to the\ninterrogations of Philippe Lheulier and the official inquisitors,\nwhich had annoyed him greatly. Hence, one fine morning, feeling himself\nbetter, he had left his golden spurs with the leech as payment, and had\nslipped away. This had not, however, interfered with the progress of the\naffair. Justice, at that epoch, troubled itself very little about the\nclearness and definiteness of a criminal suit. Provided that the accused\nwas hung, that was all that was necessary. Now the judge had plenty of\nproofs against la Esmeralda. They had supposed Phoebus to be dead, and\nthat was the end of the matter.\n\nPhoebus, on his side, had not fled far. He had simply rejoined his\ncompany in garrison at Queue-en-Brie, in the Isle-de-France, a few\nstages from Paris.\n\nAfter all, it did not please him in the least to appear in this suit.\nHe had a vague feeling that he should play a ridiculous figure in it.\nOn the whole, he did not know what to think of the whole affair.\nSuperstitious, and not given to devoutness, like every soldier who is\nonly a soldier, when he came to question himself about this adventure,\nhe did not feel assured as to the goat, as to the singular fashion in\nwhich he had met La Esmeralda, as to the no less strange manner in which\nshe had allowed him to divine her love, as to her character as a gypsy,\nand lastly, as to the surly monk. He perceived in all these incidents\nmuch more magic than love, probably a sorceress, perhaps the devil;\na comedy, in short, or to speak in the language of that day, a very\ndisagreeable mystery, in which he played a very awkward part, the role\nof blows and derision. The captain was quite put out of countenance\nabout it; he experienced that sort of shame which our La Fontaine has so\nadmirably defined,--\n\n\n        Ashamed as a fox who has been caught by a fowl.\n\n\nMoreover, he hoped that the affair would not get noised abroad, that his\nname would hardly be pronounced in it, and that in any case it would\nnot go beyond the courts of the Tournelle. In this he was not mistaken,\nthere was then no \"Gazette des Tribunaux;\" and as not a week passed\nwhich had not its counterfeiter to boil, or its witch to hang, or its\nheretic to burn, at some one of the innumerable justices of Paris,\npeople were so accustomed to seeing in all the squares the ancient\nfeudal Themis, bare armed, with sleeves stripped up, performing her duty\nat the gibbets, the ladders, and the pillories, that they hardly paid\nany heed to it. Fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name\nof the victim who passed by at the corner of the street, and it was the\npopulace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare. An\nexecution was an habitual incident of the public highways, like the\nbraising-pan of the baker or the slaughter-house of the knacker. The\nexecutioner was only a sort of butcher of a little deeper dye than the\nrest.\n\nHence Phoebus's mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress\nEsmeralda, or Similar, as he called her, concerning the blow from the\ndagger of the Bohemian or of the surly monk (it mattered little which\nto him), and as to the issue of the trial. But as soon as his heart was\nvacant in that direction, Fleur-de-Lys returned to it. Captain Phoebus's\nheart, like the physics of that day, abhorred a vacuum.\n\nQueue-en-Brie was a very insipid place to stay at then, a village\nof farriers, and cow-girls with chapped hands, a long line of poor\ndwellings and thatched cottages, which borders the grand road on both\nsides for half a league; a tail (queue), in short, as its name imports.\n\nFleur-de-Lys was his last passion but one, a pretty girl, a charming\ndowry; accordingly, one fine morning, quite cured, and assuming that,\nafter the lapse of two months, the Bohemian affair must be completely\nfinished and forgotten, the amorous cavalier arrived on a prancing horse\nat the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.\n\nHe paid no attention to a tolerably numerous rabble which had assembled\nin the Place du Parvis, before the portal of Notre-Dame; he remembered\nthat it was the month of May; he supposed that it was some procession,\nsome Pentecost, some festival, hitched his horse to the ring at the\ndoor, and gayly ascended the stairs to his beautiful betrothed.\n\nShe was alone with her mother.\n\nThe scene of the witch, her goat, her cursed alphabet, and Phoebus's\nlong absences, still weighed on Fleur-de-Lys's heart. Nevertheless, when\nshe beheld her captain enter, she thought him so handsome, his doublet\nso new, his baldrick so shining, and his air so impassioned, that she\nblushed with pleasure. The noble damsel herself was more charming than\never. Her magnificent blond hair was plaited in a ravishing manner, she\nwas dressed entirely in that sky blue which becomes fair people so well,\na bit of coquetry which she had learned from Colombe, and her eyes were\nswimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better.\n\nPhoebus, who had seen nothing in the line of beauty, since he left the\nvillage maids of Queue-en-Brie, was intoxicated with Fleur-de-Lys, which\nimparted to our officer so eager and gallant an air, that his peace\nwas immediately made. Madame de Gondelaurier herself, still maternally\nseated in her big arm-chair, had not the heart to scold him. As for\nFleur-de-Lys's reproaches, they expired in tender cooings.\n\nThe young girl was seated near the window still embroidering her grotto\nof Neptune. The captain was leaning over the back of her chair, and she\nwas addressing her caressing reproaches to him in a low voice.\n\n\"What has become of you these two long months, wicked man?\"\n\n\"I swear to you,\" replied Phoebus, somewhat embarrassed by the question,\n\"that you are beautiful enough to set an archbishop to dreaming.\"\n\nShe could not repress a smile.\n\n\"Good, good, sir. Let my beauty alone and answer my question. A fine\nbeauty, in sooth!\"\n\n\"Well, my dear cousin, I was recalled to the garrison.\n\n\"And where is that, if you please? and why did not you come to say\nfarewell?\"\n\n\"At Queue-en-Brie.\"\n\nPhoebus was delighted with the first question, which helped him to avoid\nthe second.\n\n\"But that is quite close by, monsieur. Why did you not come to see me a\nsingle time?\"\n\nHere Phoebus was rather seriously embarrassed.\n\n\"Because--the service--and then, charming cousin, I have been ill.\"\n\n\"Ill!\" she repeated in alarm.\n\n\"Yes, wounded!\"\n\n\"Wounded!\"\n\nShe poor child was completely upset.\n\n\"Oh! do not be frightened at that,\" said Phoebus, carelessly, \"it was\nnothing. A quarrel, a sword cut; what is that to you?\"\n\n\"What is that to me?\" exclaimed Fleur-de-Lys, raising her beautiful eyes\nfilled with tears. \"Oh! you do not say what you think when you speak\nthus. What sword cut was that? I wish to know all.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear fair one, I had a falling out with Mah\u00c3\u00a8 F\u00c3\u00a9dy, you know?\nthe lieutenant of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and we ripped open a few inches\nof skin for each other. That is all.\"\n\nThe mendacious captain was perfectly well aware that an affair of\nhonor always makes a man stand well in the eyes of a woman. In fact,\nFleur-de-Lys looked him full in the face, all agitated with fear,\npleasure, and admiration. Still, she was not completely reassured.\n\n\"Provided that you are wholly cured, my Phoebus!\" said she. \"I do not\nknow your Mah\u00c3\u00a8 F\u00c3\u00a9dy, but he is a villanous man. And whence arose this\nquarrel?\"\n\nHere Phoebus, whose imagination was endowed with but mediocre power\nof creation, began to find himself in a quandary as to a means of\nextricating himself for his prowess.\n\n\"Oh! how do I know?--a mere nothing, a horse, a remark! Fair cousin,\"\nhe exclaimed, for the sake of changing the conversation, \"what noise is\nthis in the Cathedral Square?\"\n\nHe approached the window.\n\n\"Oh! _Mon Dieu_, fair cousin, how many people there are on the Place!\"\n\n\"I know not,\" said Fleur-de-Lys; \"it appears that a witch is to do\npenance this morning before the church, and thereafter to be hung.\"\n\nThe captain was so thoroughly persuaded that la Esmeralda's affair was\nconcluded, that he was but little disturbed by Fleur-de-Lys's words.\nStill, he asked her one or two questions.\n\n\"What is the name of this witch?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" she replied.\n\n\"And what is she said to have done?\"\n\nShe shrugged her white shoulders.\n\n\"I know not.\"\n\n\"Oh, _mon Dieu_ Jesus!\" said her mother; \"there are so many witches\nnowadays that I dare say they burn them without knowing their names. One\nmight as well seek the name of every cloud in the sky. After all, one\nmay be tranquil. The good God keeps his register.\" Here the venerable\ndame rose and came to the window. \"Good Lord! you are right, Phoebus,\"\nsaid she. \"The rabble is indeed great. There are people on all the\nroofs, blessed be God! Do you know, Phoebus, this reminds me of my best\ndays. The entrance of King Charles VII., when, also, there were many\npeople. I no longer remember in what year that was. When I speak of this\nto you, it produces upon you the effect,--does it not?--the effect of\nsomething very old, and upon me of something very young. Oh! the\ncrowd was far finer than at the present day. They even stood upon the\nmachicolations of the Porte Sainte-Antoine. The king had the queen on a\npillion, and after their highnesses came all the ladies mounted behind\nall the lords. I remember that they laughed loudly, because beside\nAmanyon de Garlande, who was very short of stature, there rode the\nSire Matefelon, a chevalier of gigantic size, who had killed heaps of\nEnglish. It was very fine. A procession of all the gentlemen of France,\nwith their oriflammes waving red before the eye. There were some with\npennons and some with banners. How can I tell? the Sire de Calm with a\npennon; Jean de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaumorant with a banner; the Sire de Courcy with a\nbanner, and a more ample one than any of the others except the Duc de\nBourbon. Alas! 'tis a sad thing to think that all that has existed and\nexists no longer!\"\n\nThe two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager. Phoebus\nhad returned and was leaning on the back of his betrothed's chair, a\ncharming post whence his libertine glance plunged into all the openings\nof Fleur-de-Lys's gorget. This gorget gaped so conveniently, and allowed\nhim to see so many exquisite things and to divine so many more, that\nPhoebus, dazzled by this skin with its gleams of satin, said to himself,\n\"How can any one love anything but a fair skin?\"\n\nBoth were silent. The young girl raised sweet, enraptured eyes to him\nfrom time to time, and their hair mingled in a ray of spring sunshine.\n\n\"Phoebus,\" said Fleur-de-Lys suddenly, in a low voice, \"we are to be\nmarried three months hence; swear to me that you have never loved any\nother woman than myself.\"\n\n\"I swear it, fair angel!\" replied Phoebus, and his passionate glances\naided the sincere tone of his voice in convincing Fleur-de-Lys.\n\nMeanwhile, the good mother, charmed to see the betrothed pair on terms\nof such perfect understanding, had just quitted the apartment to attend\nto some domestic matter; Phoebus observed it, and this so emboldened\nthe adventurous captain that very strange ideas mounted to his brain.\nFleur-de-Lys loved him, he was her betrothed; she was alone with him;\nhis former taste for her had re-awakened, not with all its fresh-ness\nbut with all its ardor; after all, there is no great harm in tasting\none's wheat while it is still in the blade; I do not know whether\nthese ideas passed through his mind, but one thing is certain, that\nFleur-de-Lys was suddenly alarmed by the expression of his glance. She\nlooked round and saw that her mother was no longer there.\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said she, blushing and uneasy, \"how very warm I am?\"\n\n\"I think, in fact,\" replied Phoebus, \"that it cannot be far from midday.\nThe sun is troublesome. We need only lower the curtains.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed the poor little thing, \"on the contrary, I need\nair.\"\n\nAnd like a fawn who feels the breath of the pack of hounds, she rose,\nran to the window, opened it, and rushed upon the balcony.\n\nPhoebus, much discomfited, followed her.\n\n\nThe Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, upon which the balcony looked, as the\nreader knows, presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle\nwhich caused the fright of the timid Fleur-de-Lys to change its nature.\n\nAn immense crowd, which overflowed into all the neighboring streets,\nencumbered the Place, properly speaking. The little wall, breast high,\nwhich surrounded the Place, would not have sufficed to keep it free\nhad it not been lined with a thick hedge of sergeants and hackbuteers,\nculverines in hand. Thanks to this thicket of pikes and arquebuses, the\nParvis was empty. Its entrance was guarded by a force of halberdiers\nwith the armorial bearings of the bishop. The large doors of the church\nwere closed, and formed a contrast with the innumerable windows on the\nPlace, which, open to their very gables, allowed a view of thousands of\nheads heaped up almost like the piles of bullets in a park of artillery.\n\nThe surface of this rabble was dingy, dirty, earthy. The spectacle\nwhich it was expecting was evidently one of the sort which possess the\nprivilege of bringing out and calling together the vilest among the\npopulace. Nothing is so hideous as the noise which was made by that\nswarm of yellow caps and dirty heads. In that throng there were more\nlaughs than cries, more women than men.\n\nFrom time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general\nclamor.\n\n\n\n\"Oh\u00c3\u00a9! Mahiet Baliffre! Is she to be hung yonder?\"\n\n\"Fool! t'is here that she is to make her apology in her shift! the good\nGod is going to cough Latin in her face! That is always done here, at\nmidday. If 'tis the gallows that you wish, go to the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\"\n\n\"I will go there, afterwards.\"\n\n\n\n\"Tell me, la Boucanbry? Is it true that she has refused a confessor?\"\n\n\"It appears so, La Bechaigne.\"\n\n\"You see what a pagan she is!\"\n\n\n\n\"'Tis the custom, monsieur. The bailiff of the courts is bound to\ndeliver the malefactor ready judged for execution if he be a layman, to\nthe provost of Paris; if a clerk, to the official of the bishopric.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\n\n\"Oh, God!\" said Fleur-de-Lys, \"the poor creature!\"\n\nThis thought filled with sadness the glance which she cast upon the\npopulace. The captain, much more occupied with her than with that pack\nof the rabble, was amorously rumpling her girdle behind. She turned\nround, entreating and smiling.\n\n\"Please let me alone, Phoebus! If my mother were to return, she would\nsee your hand!\"\n\nAt that moment, midday rang slowly out from the clock of Notre-Dame. A\nmurmur of satisfaction broke out in the crowd. The last vibration of the\ntwelfth stroke had hardly died away when all heads surged like the waves\nbeneath a squall, and an immense shout went up from the pavement, the\nwindows, and the roofs,\n\n\"There she is!\"\n\nFleur-de-Lys pressed her hands to her eyes, that she might not see.\n\n\"Charming girl,\" said Phoebus, \"do you wish to withdraw?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied; and she opened through curiosity, the eyes which she\nhad closed through fear.\n\nA tumbrel drawn by a stout Norman horse, and all surrounded by cavalry\nin violet livery with white crosses, had just debouched upon the Place\nthrough the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs. The sergeants of the watch were\nclearing a passage for it through the crowd, by stout blows from their\nclubs. Beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police,\nrecognizable by their black costume and their awkwardness in the saddle.\nMaster Jacques Charmolue paraded at their head.\n\nIn the fatal cart sat a young girl with her arms tied behind her back,\nand with no priest beside her. She was in her shift; her long black hair\n(the fashion then was to cut it off only at the foot of the gallows)\nfell in disorder upon her half-bared throat and shoulders.\n\nAthwart that waving hair, more glossy than the plumage of a raven, a\nthick, rough, gray rope was visible, twisted and knotted, chafing her\ndelicate collar-bones and twining round the charming neck of the poor\ngirl, like an earthworm round a flower. Beneath that rope glittered a\ntiny amulet ornamented with bits of green glass, which had been left to\nher no doubt, because nothing is refused to those who are about to die.\nThe spectators in the windows could see in the bottom of the cart her\nnaked legs which she strove to hide beneath her, as by a final feminine\ninstinct. At her feet lay a little goat, bound. The condemned girl held\ntogether with her teeth her imperfectly fastened shift. One would have\nsaid that she suffered still more in her misery from being thus exposed\nalmost naked to the eyes of all. Alas! modesty is not made for such\nshocks.\n\n\"Jesus!\" said Fleur-de-Lys hastily to the captain. \"Look fair cousin,\n'tis that wretched Bohemian with the goat.\"\n\nSo saying, she turned to Phoebus. His eyes were fixed on the tumbrel. He\nwas very pale.\n\n\"What Bohemian with the goat?\" he stammered.\n\n\"What!\" resumed Fleur-de-Lys, \"do you not remember?\"\n\nPhoebus interrupted her.\n\n\"I do not know what you mean.\"\n\nHe made a step to re-enter the room, but Fleur-de-Lys, whose jealousy,\npreviously so vividly aroused by this same gypsy, had just been\nre-awakened, Fleur-de-Lys gave him a look full of penetration and\ndistrust. She vaguely recalled at that moment having heard of a captain\nmixed up in the trial of that witch.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she said to Phoebus, \"one would say, that\nthis woman had disturbed you.\"\n\nPhoebus forced a sneer,--\n\n\"Me! Not the least in the world! Ah! yes, certainly!\"\n\n\"Remain, then!\" she continued imperiously, \"and let us see the end.\"\n\nThe unlucky captain was obliged to remain. He was somewhat reassured by\nthe fact that the condemned girl never removed her eyes from the bottom\nof the cart. It was but too surely la Esmeralda. In this last stage of\nopprobrium and misfortune, she was still beautiful; her great black eyes\nappeared still larger, because of the emaciation of her cheeks; her pale\nprofile was pure and sublime. She resembled what she had been, in\nthe same degree that a virgin by Masaccio, resembles a virgin of\nRaphael,--weaker, thinner, more delicate.\n\nMoreover, there was nothing in her which was not shaken in some sort,\nand which with the exception of her modesty, she did not let go at\nwill, so profoundly had she been broken by stupor and despair. Her body\nbounded at every jolt of the tumbrel like a dead or broken thing; her\ngaze was dull and imbecile. A tear was still visible in her eyes, but\nmotionless and frozen, so to speak.\n\nMeanwhile, the lugubrious cavalcade has traversed the crowd amid cries\nof joy and curious attitudes. But as a faithful historian, we must state\nthat on beholding her so beautiful, so depressed, many were moved with\npity, even among the hardest of them.\n\nThe tumbrel had entered the Parvis.\n\nIt halted before the central portal. The escort ranged themselves in\nline on both sides. The crowd became silent, and, in the midst of this\nsilence full of anxiety and solemnity, the two leaves of the grand door\nswung back, as of themselves, on their hinges, which gave a creak like\nthe sound of a fife. Then there became visible in all its length, the\ndeep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles\ngleaming afar off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the\nPlace which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern. At the\nvery extremity, in the gloom of the apse, a gigantic silver cross\nwas visible against a black drapery which hung from the vault to the\npavement. The whole nave was deserted. But a few heads of priests could\nbe seen moving confusedly in the distant choir stalls, and, at the\nmoment when the great door opened, there escaped from the church a\nloud, solemn, and monotonous chanting, which cast over the head of the\ncondemned girl, in gusts, fragments of melancholy psalms,--\n\n\"_Non timebo millia populi circumdantis me: exsurge, Domine; salvum me\nfac, Deus_!\"\n\n\"_Salvum me fac, Deus, quoniam intraverunt aqu\u00c3\u00a6 usque ad animam meam_.\n\n\"_Infixus sum in limo profundi; et non est substantia_.\"\n\nAt the same time, another voice, separate from the choir, intoned upon\nthe steps of the chief altar, this melancholy offertory,--\"_Qui verbum\nmeum audit, et credit ei qui misit me, habet vitam oeternam et in\njudicium non venit; sed transit a morte im vitam_*.\"\n\n\n     * \"He that heareth my word and believeth on Him that sent me,\nhath eternal life, and hath not come into condemnation; but is passed\nfrom death to life.\"\n\n\nThis chant, which a few old men buried in the gloom sang from afar over\nthat beautiful creature, full of youth and life, caressed by the warm\nair of spring, inundated with sunlight was the mass for the dead.\n\nThe people listened devoutly.\n\nThe unhappy girl seemed to lose her sight and her consciousness in\nthe obscure interior of the church. Her white lips moved as though in\nprayer, and the headsman's assistant who approached to assist her\nto alight from the cart, heard her repeating this word in a low\ntone,--\"Phoebus.\"\n\nThey untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her goat, which\nhad also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself\nfree: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot\nof the steps leading to the door. The rope about her neck trailed behind\nher. One would have said it was a serpent following her.\n\nThen the chanting in the church ceased. A great golden cross and a row\nof wax candles began to move through the gloom. The halberds of the\nmotley beadles clanked; and, a few moments later, a long procession of\npriests in chasubles, and deacons in dalmatics, marched gravely towards\nthe condemned girl, as they drawled their song, spread out before her\nview and that of the crowd. But her glance rested on the one who marched\nat the head, immediately after the cross-bearer.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said in a low voice, and with a shudder, \"'tis he again! the\npriest!\"\n\nIt was in fact, the archdeacon. On his left he had the sub-chanter, on\nhis right, the chanter, armed with his official wand. He advanced with\nhead thrown back, his eyes fixed and wide open, intoning in a strong\nvoice,--\n\n\"_De ventre inferi clamavi, et exaudisti vocem meam_.\n\n\"_Et projecisti me in profundum in corde mans, et flumem circumdedit\nme_*.\"\n\n\n     *  \"Out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest\nmy voice. For thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas,\nand the floods compassed me about.\"\n\n\nAt the moment when he made his appearance in the full daylight beneath\nthe lofty arched portal, enveloped in an ample cope of silver barred\nwith a black cross, he was so pale that more than one person in the\ncrowd thought that one of the marble bishops who knelt on the sepulchral\nstones of the choir had risen and was come to receive upon the brink of\nthe tomb, the woman who was about to die.\n\nShe, no less pale, no less like a statue, had hardly noticed that they\nhad placed in her hand a heavy, lighted candle of yellow wax; she had\nnot heard the yelping voice of the clerk reading the fatal contents\nof the apology; when they told her to respond with Amen, she responded\nAmen. She only recovered life and force when she beheld the priest make\na sign to her guards to withdraw, and himself advance alone towards her.\n\nThen she felt her blood boil in her head, and a remnant of indignation\nflashed up in that soul already benumbed and cold.\n\nThe archdeacon approached her slowly; even in that extremity, she beheld\nhim cast an eye sparkling with sensuality, jealousy, and desire, over\nher exposed form. Then he said aloud,--\n\n\"Young girl, have you asked God's pardon for your faults and\nshortcomings?\"\n\nHe bent down to her ear, and added (the spectators supposed that he\nwas receiving her last confession): \"Will you have me? I can still save\nyou!\"\n\nShe looked intently at him: \"Begone, demon, or I will denounce you!\"\n\nHe gave vent to a horrible smile: \"You will not be believed. You will\nonly add a scandal to a crime. Reply quickly! Will you have me?\"\n\n\"What have you done with my Phoebus?\"\n\n\"He is dead!\" said the priest.\n\nAt that moment the wretched archdeacon raised his head mechanically and\nbeheld at the other end of the Place, in the balcony of the Gondelaurier\nmansion, the captain standing beside Fleur-de-Lys. He staggered, passed\nhis hand across his eyes, looked again, muttered a curse, and all his\nfeatures were violently contorted.\n\n\"Well, die then!\" he hissed between his teeth. \"No one shall have\nyou.\" Then, raising his hand over the gypsy, he exclaimed in a funereal\nvoice:--\"_I nunc, anima anceps, et sit tibi Deus misenicors_!\"*\n\n\n     *  \"Go now, soul, trembling in the balance, and God have mercy\nupon thee.\"\n\n\nThis was the dread formula with which it was the custom to conclude\nthese gloomy ceremonies. It was the signal agreed upon between the\npriest and the executioner.\n\nThe crowd knelt.\n\n\"_Kyrie eleison_,\"* said the priests, who had remained beneath the arch\nof the portal.\n\n\n     *  \"Lord have mercy upon us.\"\n\n\n\"_Kyrie eleison_,\" repeated the throng in that murmur which runs over\nall heads, like the waves of a troubled sea.\n\n\"Amen,\" said the archdeacon.\n\nHe turned his back on the condemned girl, his head sank upon his breast\nonce more, he crossed his hands and rejoined his escort of priests, and\na moment later he was seen to disappear, with the cross, the candles,\nand the copes, beneath the misty arches of the cathedral, and his\nsonorous voice was extinguished by degrees in the choir, as he chanted\nthis verse of despair,--\n\n\"_Omnes gurgites tui et fluctus tui super me transierunt_.\"*\n\n\n     *  \"All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me.\"\n\nAt the same time, the intermittent clash of the iron butts of the\nbeadles' halberds, gradually dying away among the columns of the nave,\nproduced the effect of a clock hammer striking the last hour of the\ncondemned.\n\nThe doors of Notre-Dame remained open, allowing a view of the empty\ndesolate church, draped in mourning, without candles, and without\nvoices.\n\nThe condemned girl remained motionless in her place, waiting to be\ndisposed of. One of the sergeants of police was obliged to notify Master\nCharmolue of the fact, as the latter, during this entire scene, had been\nengaged in studying the bas-relief of the grand portal which represents,\naccording to some, the sacrifice of Abraham; according to others, the\nphilosopher's alchemical operation: the sun being figured forth by the\nangel; the fire, by the fagot; the artisan, by Abraham.\n\nThere was considerable difficulty in drawing him away from that\ncontemplation, but at length he turned round; and, at a signal which he\ngave, two men clad in yellow, the executioner's assistants, approached\nthe gypsy to bind her hands once more.\n\nThe unhappy creature, at the moment of mounting once again the fatal\ncart, and proceeding to her last halting-place, was seized, possibly,\nwith some poignant clinging to life. She raised her dry, red eyes to\nheaven, to the sun, to the silvery clouds, cut here and there by a blue\ntrapezium or triangle; then she lowered them to objects around her, to\nthe earth, the throng, the houses; all at once, while the yellow man was\nbinding her elbows, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy. Yonder, on\nthat balcony, at the corner of the Place, she had just caught sight of\nhim, of her friend, her lord, Phoebus, the other apparition of her life!\n\nThe judge had lied! the priest had lied! it was certainly he, she could\nnot doubt it; he was there, handsome, alive, dressed in his brilliant\nuniform, his plume on his head, his sword by his side!\n\n\"Phoebus!\" she cried, \"my Phoebus!\"\n\nAnd she tried to stretch towards him arms trembling with love and\nrapture, but they were bound.\n\nThen she saw the captain frown, a beautiful young girl who was leaning\nagainst him gazed at him with disdainful lips and irritated eyes; then\nPhoebus uttered some words which did not reach her, and both disappeared\nprecipitately behind the window opening upon the balcony, which closed\nafter them.\n\n\"Phoebus!\" she cried wildly, \"can it be you believe it?\" A monstrous\nthought had just presented itself to her. She remembered that she had\nbeen condemned to death for murder committed on the person of Phoebus de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers.\n\nShe had borne up until that moment. But this last blow was too harsh.\nShe fell lifeless on the pavement.\n\n\"Come,\" said Charmolue, \"carry her to the cart, and make an end of it.\"\n\nNo one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings,\ncarved directly above the arches of the portal, a strange spectator, who\nhad, up to that time, observed everything with such impassiveness, with\na neck so strained, a visage so hideous that, in his motley accoutrement\nof red and violet, he might have been taken for one of those stone\nmonsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have\ndischarged their waters for six hundred years. This spectator had missed\nnothing that had taken place since midday in front of the portal of\nNotre-Dame. And at the very beginning he had securely fastened to one of\nthe small columns a large knotted rope, one end of which trailed on the\nflight of steps below. This being done, he began to look on tranquilly,\nwhistling from time to time when a blackbird flitted past. Suddenly,\nat the moment when the superintendent's assistants were preparing\nto execute Charmolue's phlegmatic order, he threw his leg over the\nbalustrade of the gallery, seized the rope with his feet, his knees and\nhis hands; then he was seen to glide down the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, as a drop of\nrain slips down a window-pane, rush to the two executioners with the\nswiftness of a cat which has fallen from a roof, knock them down with\ntwo enormous fists, pick up the gypsy with one hand, as a child would\nher doll, and dash back into the church with a single bound, lifting the\nyoung girl above his head and crying in a formidable voice,--\n\n\"Sanctuary!\"\n\nThis was done with such rapidity, that had it taken place at night,\nthe whole of it could have been seen in the space of a single flash of\nlightning.\n\n\"Sanctuary! Sanctuary!\" repeated the crowd; and the clapping of ten\nthousand hands made Quasimodo's single eye sparkle with joy and pride.\n\nThis shock restored the condemned girl to her senses. She raised her\neyelids, looked at Quasimodo, then closed them again suddenly, as though\nterrified by her deliverer.\n\nCharmolue was stupefied, as well as the executioners and the entire\nescort. In fact, within the bounds of Notre-Dame, the condemned girl\ncould not be touched. The cathedral was a place of refuge. All temporal\njurisdiction expired upon its threshold.\n\nQuasimodo had halted beneath the great portal, his huge feet seemed\nas solid on the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars.\nHis great, bushy head sat low between his shoulders, like the heads of\nlions, who also have a mane and no neck. He held the young girl, who was\nquivering all over, suspended from his horny hands like a white drapery;\nbut he carried her with as much care as though he feared to break her\nor blight her. One would have said that he felt that she was a delicate,\nexquisite, precious thing, made for other hands than his. There were\nmoments when he looked as if not daring to touch her, even with his\nbreath. Then, all at once, he would press her forcibly in his arms,\nagainst his angular bosom, like his own possession, his treasure, as\nthe mother of that child would have done. His gnome's eye, fastened upon\nher, inundated her with tenderness, sadness, and pity, and was suddenly\nraised filled with lightnings. Then the women laughed and wept, the\ncrowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment Quasimodo had a\nbeauty of his own. He was handsome; he, that orphan, that foundling,\nthat outcast, he felt himself august and strong, he gazed in the face\nof that society from which he was banished, and in which he had so\npowerfully intervened, of that human justice from which he had wrenched\nits prey, of all those tigers whose jaws were forced to remain empty, of\nthose policemen, those judges, those executioners, of all that force of\nthe king which he, the meanest of creatures, had just broken, with the\nforce of God.\n\nAnd then, it was touching to behold this protection which had fallen\nfrom a being so hideous upon a being so unhappy, a creature condemned to\ndeath saved by Quasimodo. They were two extremes of natural and social\nwretchedness, coming into contact and aiding each other.\n\nMeanwhile, after several moments of triumph, Quasimodo had plunged\nabruptly into the church with his burden. The populace, fond of all\nprowess, sought him with their eyes, beneath the gloomy nave, regretting\nthat he had so speedily disappeared from their acclamations. All at\nonce, he was seen to re-appear at one of the extremities of the gallery\nof the kings of France; he traversed it, running like a madman, raising\nhis conquest high in his arms and shouting: \"Sanctuary!\" The crowd broke\nforth into fresh applause. The gallery passed, he plunged once more\ninto the interior of the church. A moment later, he re-appeared upon the\nupper platform, with the gypsy still in his arms, still running madly,\nstill crying, \"Sanctuary!\" and the throng applauded. Finally, he made\nhis appearance for the third time upon the summit of the tower where\nhung the great bell; from that point he seemed to be showing to the\nentire city the girl whom he had saved, and his voice of thunder, that\nvoice which was so rarely heard, and which he never heard himself,\nrepeated thrice with frenzy, even to the clouds: \"Sanctuary! Sanctuary!\nSanctuary!\"\n\n\"Noel! Noel!\" shouted the populace in its turn; and that immense\nacclamation flew to astonish the crowd assembled at the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve on the\nother bank, and the recluse who was still waiting with her eyes riveted\non the gibbet.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK NINTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. DELIRIUM.\n\n\n\nClaude Frollo was no longer in Notre-Dame when his adopted son so\nabruptly cut the fatal web in which the archdeacon and the gypsy were\nentangled. On returning to the sacristy he had torn off his alb, cope,\nand stole, had flung all into the hands of the stupefied beadle, had\nmade his escape through the private door of the cloister, had ordered a\nboatman of the Terrain to transport him to the left bank of the Seine,\nand had plunged into the hilly streets of the University, not knowing\nwhither he was going, encountering at every step groups of men and women\nwho were hurrying joyously towards the Pont Saint-Michel, in the hope\nof still arriving in time to see the witch hung there,--pale, wild, more\ntroubled, more blind and more fierce than a night bird let loose and\npursued by a troop of children in broad daylight. He no longer knew\nwhere he was, what he thought, or whether he were dreaming. He went\nforward, walking, running, taking any street at haphazard, making no\nchoice, only urged ever onward away from the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, the horrible Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve,\nwhich he felt confusedly, to be behind him.\n\nIn this manner he skirted Mount Sainte-Genevi\u00c3\u00a8ve, and finally emerged\nfrom the town by the Porte Saint-Victor. He continued his flight as long\nas he could see, when he turned round, the turreted enclosure of the\nUniversity, and the rare houses of the suburb; but, when, at length, a\nrise of ground had completely concealed from him that odious Paris, when\nhe could believe himself to be a hundred leagues distant from it, in the\nfields, in the desert, he halted, and it seemed to him that he breathed\nmore freely.\n\nThen frightful ideas thronged his mind. Once more he could see clearly\ninto his soul, and he shuddered. He thought of that unhappy girl who had\ndestroyed him, and whom he had destroyed. He cast a haggard eye over the\ndouble, tortuous way which fate had caused their two destinies to pursue\nup to their point of intersection, where it had dashed them against each\nother without mercy. He meditated on the folly of eternal vows, on\nthe vanity of chastity, of science, of religion, of virtue, on the\nuselessness of God. He plunged to his heart's content in evil thoughts,\nand in proportion as he sank deeper, he felt a Satanic laugh burst forth\nwithin him.\n\nAnd as he thus sifted his soul to the bottom, when he perceived how\nlarge a space nature had prepared there for the passions, he sneered\nstill more bitterly. He stirred up in the depths of his heart all his\nhatred, all his malevolence; and, with the cold glance of a physician\nwho examines a patient, he recognized the fact that this malevolence\nwas nothing but vitiated love; that love, that source of every virtue in\nman, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man\nconstituted like himself, in making himself a priest, made himself a\ndemon. Then he laughed frightfully, and suddenly became pale again,\nwhen he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that\ncorrosive, venomous malignant, implacable love, which had ended only in\nthe gibbet for one of them and in hell for the other; condemnation for\nher, damnation for him.\n\nAnd then his laughter came again, when he reflected that Phoebus\nwas alive; that after all, the captain lived, was gay and happy, had\nhandsomer doublets than ever, and a new mistress whom he was conducting\nto see the old one hanged. His sneer redoubled its bitterness when he\nreflected that out of the living beings whose death he had desired, the\ngypsy, the only creature whom he did not hate, was the only one who had\nnot escaped him.\n\nThen from the captain, his thought passed to the people, and there came\nto him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort. He reflected that the people\nalso, the entire populace, had had before their eyes the woman whom he\nloved exposed almost naked. He writhed his arms with agony as he thought\nthat the woman whose form, caught by him alone in the darkness would\nhave been supreme happiness, had been delivered up in broad daylight at\nfull noonday, to a whole people, clad as for a night of voluptuousness.\nHe wept with rage over all these mysteries of love, profaned, soiled,\nlaid bare, withered forever. He wept with rage as he pictured to himself\nhow many impure looks had been gratified at the sight of that badly\nfastened shift, and that this beautiful girl, this virgin lily, this cup\nof modesty and delight, to which he would have dared to place his lips\nonly trembling, had just been transformed into a sort of public bowl,\nwhereat the vilest populace of Paris, thieves, beggars, lackeys, had\ncome to quaff in common an audacious, impure, and depraved pleasure.\n\nAnd when he sought to picture to himself the happiness which he might\nhave found upon earth, if she had not been a gypsy, and if he had not\nbeen a priest, if Phoebus had not existed and if she had loved him; when\nhe pictured to himself that a life of serenity and love would have been\npossible to him also, even to him; that there were at that very moment,\nhere and there upon the earth, happy couples spending the hours in sweet\nconverse beneath orange trees, on the banks of brooks, in the presence\nof a setting sun, of a starry night; and that if God had so willed,\nhe might have formed with her one of those blessed couples,--his heart\nmelted in tenderness and despair.\n\nOh! she! still she! It was this fixed idea which returned incessantly,\nwhich tortured him, which ate into his brain, and rent his vitals. He\ndid not regret, he did not repent; all that he had done he was ready\nto do again; he preferred to behold her in the hands of the executioner\nrather than in the arms of the captain. But he suffered; he suffered\nso that at intervals he tore out handfuls of his hair to see whether it\nwere not turning white.\n\nAmong other moments there came one, when it occurred to him that it was\nperhaps the very minute when the hideous chain which he had seen\nthat morning, was pressing its iron noose closer about that frail and\ngraceful neck. This thought caused the perspiration to start from every\npore.\n\nThere was another moment when, while laughing diabolically at himself,\nhe represented to himself la Esmeralda as he had seen her on that\nfirst day, lively, careless, joyous, gayly attired, dancing, winged,\nharmonious, and la Esmeralda of the last day, in her scanty shift, with\na rope about her neck, mounting slowly with her bare feet, the angular\nladder of the gallows; he figured to himself this double picture in such\na manner that he gave vent to a terrible cry.\n\nWhile this hurricane of despair overturned, broke, tore up, bent,\nuprooted everything in his soul, he gazed at nature around him. At his\nfeet, some chickens were searching the thickets and pecking, enamelled\nbeetles ran about in the sun; overhead, some groups of dappled gray\nclouds were floating across the blue sky; on the horizon, the spire\nof the Abbey Saint-Victor pierced the ridge of the hill with its slate\nobelisk; and the miller of the Copeaue hillock was whistling as he\nwatched the laborious wings of his mill turning. All this active,\norganized, tranquil life, recurring around him under a thousand forms,\nhurt him. He resumed his flight.\n\nHe sped thus across the fields until evening. This flight from nature,\nlife, himself, man, God, everything, lasted all day long. Sometimes he\nflung himself face downward on the earth, and tore up the young blades\nof wheat with his nails. Sometimes he halted in the deserted street of\na village, and his thoughts were so intolerable that he grasped his head\nin both hands and tried to tear it from his shoulders in order to dash\nit upon the pavement.\n\nTowards the hour of sunset, he examined himself again, and found himself\nnearly mad. The tempest which had raged within him ever since the\ninstant when he had lost the hope and the will to save the gypsy,--that\ntempest had not left in his conscience a single healthy idea, a single\nthought which maintained its upright position. His reason lay there\nalmost entirely destroyed. There remained but two distinct images in his\nmind, la Esmeralda and the gallows; all the rest was blank. Those two\nimages united, presented to him a frightful group; and the more he\nconcentrated what attention and thought was left to him, the more he\nbeheld them grow, in accordance with a fantastic progression, the one in\ngrace, in charm, in beauty, in light, the other in deformity and horror;\nso that at last la Esmeralda appeared to him like a star, the gibbet\nlike an enormous, fleshless arm.\n\nOne remarkable fact is, that during the whole of this torture, the idea\nof dying did not seriously occur to him. The wretch was made so. He\nclung to life. Perhaps he really saw hell beyond it.\n\nMeanwhile, the day continued to decline. The living being which still\nexisted in him reflected vaguely on retracing its steps. He believed\nhimself to be far away from Paris; on taking his bearings, he perceived\nthat he had only circled the enclosure of the University. The spire of\nSaint-Sulpice, and the three lofty needles of Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00c3\u00a9s,\nrose above the horizon on his right. He turned his steps in that\ndirection. When he heard the brisk challenge of the men-at-arms of the\nabbey, around the crenelated, circumscribing wall of Saint-Germain, he\nturned aside, took a path which presented itself between the abbey and\nthe lazar-house of the bourg, and at the expiration of a few minutes\nfound himself on the verge of the Pr\u00c3\u00a9-aux-Clercs. This meadow was\ncelebrated by reason of the brawls which went on there night and day;\nit was the hydra of the poor monks of Saint-Germain: _quod mouachis\nSancti-Germaini pratensis hydra fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum\ncapita suscitantibus_. The archdeacon was afraid of meeting some one\nthere; he feared every human countenance; he had just avoided the\nUniversity and the Bourg Saint-Germain; he wished to re-enter the\nstreets as late as possible. He skirted the Pr\u00c3\u00a9-aux-Clercs, took the\ndeserted path which separated it from the Dieu-Neuf, and at last reached\nthe water's edge. There Dom Claude found a boatman, who, for a few\nfarthings in Parisian coinage, rowed him up the Seine as far as the\npoint of the city, and landed him on that tongue of abandoned land\nwhere the reader has already beheld Gringoire dreaming, and which\nwas prolonged beyond the king's gardens, parallel to the Ile du\nPasseur-aux-Vaches.\n\nThe monotonous rocking of the boat and the ripple of the water had, in\nsome sort, quieted the unhappy Claude. When the boatman had taken his\ndeparture, he remained standing stupidly on the strand, staring straight\nbefore him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations\nwhich rendered everything a sort of phantasmagoria to him. The fatigue\nof a great grief not infrequently produces this effect on the mind.\n\nThe sun had set behind the lofty Tour-de-Nesle. It was the twilight\nhour. The sky was white, the water of the river was white. Between these\ntwo white expanses, the left bank of the Seine, on which his eyes were\nfixed, projected its gloomy mass and, rendered ever thinner and thinner\nby perspective, it plunged into the gloom of the horizon like a black\nspire. It was loaded with houses, of which only the obscure outline\ncould be distinguished, sharply brought out in shadows against the light\nbackground of the sky and the water. Here and there windows began to\ngleam, like the holes in a brazier. That immense black obelisk thus\nisolated between the two white expanses of the sky and the river,\nwhich was very broad at this point, produced upon Dom Claude a singular\neffect, comparable to that which would be experienced by a man who,\nreclining on his back at the foot of the tower of Strasburg, should gaze\nat the enormous spire plunging into the shadows of the twilight above\nhis head. Only, in this case, it was Claude who was erect and the\nobelisk which was lying down; but, as the river, reflecting the sky,\nprolonged the abyss below him, the immense promontory seemed to be as\nboldly launched into space as any cathedral spire; and the impression\nwas the same. This impression had even one stronger and more profound\npoint about it, that it was indeed the tower of Strasbourg, but the\ntower of Strasbourg two leagues in height; something unheard of,\ngigantic, immeasurable; an edifice such as no human eye has ever seen;\na tower of Babel. The chimneys of the houses, the battlements of the\nwalls, the faceted gables of the roofs, the spire of the Augustines,\nthe tower of Nesle, all these projections which broke the profile of\nthe colossal obelisk added to the illusion by displaying in eccentric\nfashion to the eye the indentations of a luxuriant and fantastic\nsculpture.\n\nClaude, in the state of hallucination in which he found himself,\nbelieved that he saw, that he saw with his actual eyes, the bell tower\nof hell; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the\nterrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior\nfurnace; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many\nshrieks, so many death groans. Then he became alarmed, he put his hands\non his ears that he might no longer hear, turned his back that he might\nno longer see, and fled from the frightful vision with hasty strides.\n\nBut the vision was in himself.\n\nWhen he re-entered the streets, the passers-by elbowing each other by\nthe light of the shop-fronts, produced upon him the effect of a constant\ngoing and coming of spectres about him. There were strange noises in his\nears; extraordinary fancies disturbed his brain. He saw neither\nhouses, nor pavements, nor chariots, nor men and women, but a chaos of\nindeterminate objects whose edges melted into each other. At the corner\nof the Rue de la Barillerie, there was a grocer's shop whose porch was\ngarnished all about, according to immemorial custom, with hoops of tin\nfrom which hung a circle of wooden candles, which came in contact with\neach other in the wind, and rattled like castanets. He thought he heard\na cluster of skeletons at Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on clashing together in the gloom.\n\n\"Oh!\" he muttered, \"the night breeze dashes them against each other,\nand mingles the noise of their chains with the rattle of their bones!\nPerhaps she is there among them!\"\n\nIn his state of frenzy, he knew not whither he was going. After a few\nstrides he found himself on the Pont Saint-Michel. There was a light\nin the window of a ground-floor room; he approached. Through a cracked\nwindow he beheld a mean chamber which recalled some confused memory\nto his mind. In that room, badly lighted by a meagre lamp, there was a\nfresh, light-haired young man, with a merry face, who amid loud bursts\nof laughter was embracing a very audaciously attired young girl; and\nnear the lamp sat an old crone spinning and singing in a quavering\nvoice. As the young man did not laugh constantly, fragments of the old\nwoman's ditty reached the priest; it was something unintelligible yet\nfrightful,--\n\n\n         \"_Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, aboie, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, grouille!\n         File, file, ma quenouille,\n         File sa corde au bourreau,\n         Qui siffle dans le pre au,\n         Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, aboie, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, grouille_!\n\n        \"_La belle corde de chanvre!\n        Semez d'Issy jusqu'\u00c3\u00a1 Vanvre\n        Du chanvre et non pas du bleu.\n        Le voleur n'a pas vole\n        La belle corde de chanvre_.\n\n        \"_Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, grouille, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, aboie!\n        Pour voir la fille de joie,\n        Prendre au gibet chassieux,\n        Les fen\u00c3\u00aatres sont des yeux.\n        Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, grouille, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, aboie!_\"*\n\n\n     *  Bark, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, grumble, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve!  Spin, spin, my distaff, spin\nher rope for the hangman, who is whistling in the meadow. What a\nbeautiful hempen rope! Sow hemp, not wheat, from Issy to Vanvre. The\nthief hath not stolen the beautiful hempen rope. Grumble, Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, bark,\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve! To see the dissolute wench hang on the blear-eyed gibbet, windows\nare eyes.\n\n\nThereupon the young man laughed and caressed the wench. The crone was\nla Falourdel; the girl was a courtesan; the young man was his brother\nJehan.\n\nHe continued to gaze. That spectacle was as good as any other.\n\nHe saw Jehan go to a window at the end of the room, open it, cast a\nglance on the quay, where in the distance blazed a thousand lighted\ncasements, and he heard him say as he closed the sash,--\n\n\"'Pon my soul! How dark it is; the people are lighting their candles,\nand the good God his stars.\"\n\nThen Jehan came back to the hag, smashed a bottle standing on the table,\nexclaiming,--\n\n\"Already empty, _cor-boeuf_! and I have no more money! Isabeau, my dear,\nI shall not be satisfied with Jupiter until he has changed your two\nwhite nipples into two black bottles, where I may suck wine of Beaune\nday and night.\"\n\nThis fine pleasantry made the courtesan laugh, and Jehan left the room.\n\nDom Claude had barely time to fling himself on the ground in order that\nhe might not be met, stared in the face and recognized by his brother.\nLuckily, the street was dark, and the scholar was tipsy. Nevertheless,\nhe caught sight of the archdeacon prone upon the earth in the mud.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said he; \"here's a fellow who has been leading a jolly life,\nto-day.\"\n\nHe stirred up Dom Claude with his foot, and the latter held his breath.\n\n\"Dead drunk,\" resumed Jehan. \"Come, he's full. A regular leech detached\nfrom a hogshead. He's bald,\" he added, bending down, \"'tis an old man!\n_Fortunate senex_!\"\n\nThen Dom Claude heard him retreat, saying,--\n\n\"'Tis all the same, reason is a fine thing, and my brother the\narchdeacon is very happy in that he is wise and has money.\"\n\nThen the archdeacon rose to his feet, and ran without halting, towards\nNotre-Dame, whose enormous towers he beheld rising above the houses\nthrough the gloom.\n\nAt the instant when he arrived, panting, on the Place du Parvis, he\nshrank back and dared not raise his eyes to the fatal edifice.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said, in a low voice, \"is it really true that such a thing took\nplace here, to-day, this very morning?\"\n\nStill, he ventured to glance at the church. The front was sombre; the\nsky behind was glittering with stars. The crescent of the moon, in her\nflight upward from the horizon, had paused at the moment, on the summit\nof the light hand tower, and seemed to have perched itself, like a\nluminous bird, on the edge of the balustrade, cut out in black trefoils.\n\nThe cloister door was shut; but the archdeacon always carried with him\nthe key of the tower in which his laboratory was situated. He made use\nof it to enter the church.\n\nIn the church he found the gloom and silence of a cavern. By the deep\nshadows which fell in broad sheets from all directions, he recognized\nthe fact that the hangings for the ceremony of the morning had not yet\nbeen removed. The great silver cross shone from the depths of the\ngloom, powdered with some sparkling points, like the milky way of\nthat sepulchral night. The long windows of the choir showed the upper\nextremities of their arches above the black draperies, and their painted\npanes, traversed by a ray of moonlight had no longer any hues but the\ndoubtful colors of night, a sort of violet, white and blue, whose tint\nis found only on the faces of the dead. The archdeacon, on perceiving\nthese wan spots all around the choir, thought he beheld the mitres of\ndamned bishops. He shut his eyes, and when he opened them again, he\nthought they were a circle of pale visages gazing at him.\n\nHe started to flee across the church. Then it seemed to him that the\nchurch also was shaking, moving, becoming endued with animation, that it\nwas alive; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous\npaw, which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula, and that\nthe gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious\nelephant, which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet,\nits two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings.\n\nThis fever or madness had reached such a degree of intensity that the\nexternal world was no longer anything more for the unhappy man than a\nsort of Apocalypse,--visible, palpable, terrible.\n\nFor one moment, he was relieved. As he plunged into the side aisles, he\nperceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars. He ran towards it\nas to a star. It was the poor lamp which lighted the public breviary\nof Notre-Dame night and day, beneath its iron grating. He flung himself\neagerly upon the holy book in the hope of finding some consolation, or\nsome encouragement there. The hook lay open at this passage of Job, over\nwhich his staring eye glanced,--\n\n\"And a spirit passed before my face, and I heard a small voice, and the\nhair of my flesh stood up.\"\n\nOn reading these gloomy words, he felt that which a blind man feels when\nhe feels himself pricked by the staff which he has picked up. His knees\ngave way beneath him, and he sank upon the pavement, thinking of her who\nhad died that day. He felt so many monstrous vapors pass and discharge\nthemselves in his brain, that it seemed to him that his head had become\none of the chimneys of hell.\n\nIt would appear that he remained a long time in this attitude, no longer\nthinking, overwhelmed and passive beneath the hand of the demon. At\nlength some strength returned to him; it occurred to him to take refuge\nin his tower beside his faithful Quasimodo. He rose; and, as he was\nafraid, he took the lamp from the breviary to light his way. It was a\nsacrilege; but he had got beyond heeding such a trifle now.\n\nHe slowly climbed the stairs of the towers, filled with a secret fright\nwhich must have been communicated to the rare passers-by in the Place\ndu Parvis by the mysterious light of his lamp, mounting so late from\nloophole to loophole of the bell tower.\n\nAll at once, he felt a freshness on his face, and found himself at the\ndoor of the highest gallery. The air was cold; the sky was filled with\nhurrying clouds, whose large, white flakes drifted one upon another like\nthe breaking up of river ice after the winter. The crescent of the moon,\nstranded in the midst of the clouds, seemed a celestial vessel caught in\nthe ice-cakes of the air.\n\nHe lowered his gaze, and contemplated for a moment, through the railing\nof slender columns which unites the two towers, far away, through a\ngauze of mists and smoke, the silent throng of the roofs of Paris,\npointed, innumerable, crowded and small like the waves of a tranquil sea\non a sum-mer night.\n\nThe moon cast a feeble ray, which imparted to earth and heaven an ashy\nhue.\n\nAt that moment the clock raised its shrill, cracked voice. Midnight rang\nout. The priest thought of midday; twelve o'clock had come back again.\n\n\"Oh!\" he said in a very low tone, \"she must be cold now.\"\n\nAll at once, a gust of wind extinguished his lamp, and almost at the\nsame instant, he beheld a shade, a whiteness, a form, a woman, appear\nfrom the opposite angle of the tower. He started. Beside this woman was\na little goat, which mingled its bleat with the last bleat of the clock.\n\nHe had strength enough to look. It was she.\n\nShe was pale, she was gloomy. Her hair fell over her shoulders as in the\nmorning; but there was no longer a rope on her neck, her hands were no\nlonger bound; she was free, she was dead.\n\nShe was dressed in white and had a white veil on her head.\n\nShe came towards him, slowly, with her gaze fixed on the sky. The\nsupernatural goat followed her. He felt as though made of stone and\ntoo heavy to flee. At every step which she took in advance, he took one\nbackwards, and that was all. In this way he retreated once more beneath\nthe gloomy arch of the stairway. He was chilled by the thought that she\nmight enter there also; had she done so, he would have died of terror.\n\nShe did arrive, in fact, in front of the door to the stairway, and\npaused there for several minutes, stared intently into the darkness, but\nwithout appearing to see the priest, and passed on. She seemed taller\nto him than when she had been alive; he saw the moon through her white\nrobe; he heard her breath.\n\nWhen she had passed on, he began to descend the staircase again, with\nthe slowness which he had observed in the spectre, believing himself to\nbe a spectre too, haggard, with hair on end, his extinguished lamp still\nin his hand; and as he descended the spiral steps, he distinctly heard\nin his ear a voice laughing and repeating,--\n\n\"A spirit passed before my face, and I heard a small voice, and the hair\nof my flesh stood up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. HUNCHBACKED, ONE EYED, LAME.\n\n\n\nEvery city during the Middle Ages, and every city in France down to the\ntime of Louis XII. had its places of asylum. These sanctuaries, in the\nmidst of the deluge of penal and barbarous jurisdictions which inundated\nthe city, were a species of islands which rose above the level of human\njustice. Every criminal who landed there was safe. There were in every\nsuburb almost as many places of asylum as gallows. It was the abuse of\nimpunity by the side of the abuse of punishment; two bad things which\nstrove to correct each other. The palaces of the king, the hotels of\nthe princes, and especially churches, possessed the right of asylum.\nSometimes a whole city which stood in need of being repeopled was\ntemporarily created a place of refuge. Louis XI. made all Paris a refuge\nin 1467.\n\nHis foot once within the asylum, the criminal was sacred; but he must\nbeware of leaving it; one step outside the sanctuary, and he fell back\ninto the flood. The wheel, the gibbet, the strappado, kept good guard\naround the place of refuge, and lay in watch incessantly for their prey,\nlike sharks around a vessel. Hence, condemned men were to be seen whose\nhair had grown white in a cloister, on the steps of a palace, in the\nenclosure of an abbey, beneath the porch of a church; in this manner the\nasylum was a prison as much as any other. It sometimes happened that\na solemn decree of parliament violated the asylum and restored the\ncondemned man to the executioner; but this was of rare occurrence.\nParliaments were afraid of the bishops, and when there was friction\nbetween these two robes, the gown had but a poor chance against the\ncassock. Sometimes, however, as in the affair of the assassins of\nPetit-Jean, the headsman of Paris, and in that of Emery Rousseau, the\nmurderer of Jean Valleret, justice overleaped the church and passed on\nto the execution of its sentences; but unless by virtue of a decree of\nParliament, woe to him who violated a place of asylum with armed force!\nThe reader knows the manner of death of Robert de Clermont, Marshal\nof France, and of Jean de Ch\u00c3\u00a2lons, Marshal of Champagne; and yet\nthe question was only of a certain Perrin Marc, the clerk of a\nmoney-changer, a miserable assassin; but the two marshals had broken the\ndoors of St. M\u00c3\u00a9ry. Therein lay the enormity.\n\nSuch respect was cherished for places of refuge that, according to\ntradition, animals even felt it at times. Aymoire relates that a\nstag, being chased by Dagobert, having taken refuge near the tomb of\nSaint-Denis, the pack of hounds stopped short and barked.\n\nChurches generally had a small apartment prepared for the reception of\nsupplicants. In 1407, Nicolas Flamel caused to be built on the vaults of\nSaint-Jacques de la Boucherie, a chamber which cost him four livres six\nsous, sixteen farthings, parisis.\n\nAt Notre-Dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side aisle,\nbeneath the flying buttresses, precisely at the spot where the wife of\nthe present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which\nis to the hanging gardens of Babylon what a lettuce is to a palm-tree,\nwhat a porter's wife is to a Semiramis.\n\nIt was here that Quasimodo had deposited la Esmeralda, after his wild\nand triumphant course. As long as that course lasted, the young girl\nhad been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no\nlonger feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air,\nfloating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the\nearth. From time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice\nof Quasimodo in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she\nconfusedly beheld Paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and\ntiles, like a red and blue mosaic, above her head the frightful and\njoyous face of Quasimodo. Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought\nthat all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that\nthe misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold\nof her and was bearing her away. She dared not look at him, and she\nsurrendered herself to her fate. But when the bellringer, dishevelled\nand panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his\nhuge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt\nthat sort of shock which awakens with a start the passengers of a vessel\nwhich runs aground in the middle of a dark night. Her thoughts\nawoke also, and returned to her one by one. She saw that she was in\nNotre-Dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the\nexecutioner; that Phoebus was alive, that Phoebus loved her no longer;\nand as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the\nother, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl;\nshe turned to Quasimodo, who was standing in front of her, and who\nterrified her; she said to him,--\"Why have you saved me?\"\n\nHe gazed at her with anxiety, as though seeking to divine what she was\nsaying to him. She repeated her question. Then he gave her a profoundly\nsorrowful glance and fled. She was astonished.\n\nA few moments later he returned, bearing a package which he cast at\nher feet. It was clothing which some charitable women had left on the\nthreshold of the church for her.\n\nThen she dropped her eyes upon herself and saw that she was almost\nnaked, and blushed. Life had returned.\n\nQuasimodo appeared to experience something of this modesty. He covered\nhis eyes with his large hand and retired once more, but slowly.\n\nShe made haste to dress herself. The robe was a white one with a white\nveil,--the garb of a novice of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-Dien.\n\nShe had barely finished when she beheld Quasimodo returning. He carried\na basket under one arm and a mattress under the other. In the basket\nthere was a bottle, bread, and some provisions. He set the basket on the\nfloor and said, \"Eat!\" He spread the mattress on the flagging and said,\n\"Sleep.\"\n\nIt was his own repast, it was his own bed, which the bellringer had gone\nin search of.\n\nThe gypsy raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a\nword. She dropped her head with a quiver of terror.\n\nThen he said to her.--\n\n\"I frighten you. I am very ugly, am I not? Do not look at me; only\nlisten to me. During the day you will remain here; at night you can walk\nall over the church. But do not leave the church either by day or by\nnight. You would be lost. They would kill you, and I should die.\"\n\nShe was touched and raised her head to answer him. He had disappeared.\nShe found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of\nthis almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which\nwas so hoarse yet so gentle.\n\nThen she examined her cell. It was a chamber about six feet square,\nwith a small window and a door on the slightly sloping plane of the roof\nformed of flat stones. Many gutters with the figures of animals seemed\nto be bending down around her, and stretching their necks in order to\nstare at her through the window. Over the edge of her roof she perceived\nthe tops of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the\nfires in Paris to rise beneath her eyes. A sad sight for the poor gypsy,\na foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country,\nwithout family, without a hearthstone.\n\nAt the moment when the thought of her isolation thus appeared to her\nmore poignant than ever, she felt a bearded and hairy head glide between\nher hands, upon her knees. She started (everything alarmed her now) and\nlooked. It was the poor goat, the agile Djali, which had made its escape\nafter her, at the moment when Quasimodo had put to flight Charmolue's\nbrigade, and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly\nan hour past, without being able to win a glance. The gypsy covered him\nwith kisses.\n\n\"Oh! Djali!\" she said, \"how I have forgotten thee! And so thou still\nthinkest of me! Oh! thou art not an ingrate!\"\n\nAt the same time, as though an invisible hand had lifted the weight\nwhich had repressed her tears in her heart for so long, she began to\nweep, and, in proportion as her tears flowed, she felt all that was most\nacrid and bitter in her grief depart with them.\n\nEvening came, she thought the night so beautiful that she made the\ncircuit of the elevated gallery which surrounds the church. It afforded\nher some relief, so calm did the earth appear when viewed from that\nheight.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. DEAF.\n\n\n\nOn the following morning, she perceived on awaking, that she had\nbeen asleep. This singular thing astonished her. She had been so long\nunaccustomed to sleep! A joyous ray of the rising sun entered through\nher window and touched her face. At the same time with the sun, she\nbeheld at that window an object which frightened her, the unfortunate\nface of Quasimodo. She involuntarily closed her eyes again, but in vain;\nshe fancied that she still saw through the rosy lids that gnome's mask,\none-eyed and gap-toothed. Then, while she still kept her eyes closed,\nshe heard a rough voice saying, very gently,--\n\n\"Be not afraid. I am your friend. I came to watch you sleep. It does not\nhurt you if I come to see you sleep, does it? What difference does it\nmake to you if I am here when your eyes are closed! Now I am going.\nStay, I have placed myself behind the wall. You can open your eyes\nagain.\"\n\nThere was something more plaintive than these words, and that was the\naccent in which they were uttered. The gypsy, much touched, opened\nher eyes. He was, in fact, no longer at the window. She approached the\nopening, and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the\nwall, in a sad and resigned attitude. She made an effort to surmount the\nrepugnance with which he inspired her. \"Come,\" she said to him gently.\nFrom the movement of the gypsy's lips, Quasimodo thought that she\nwas driving him away; then he rose and retired limping, slowly, with\ndrooping head, without even daring to raise to the young girl his gaze\nfull of despair. \"Do come,\" she cried, but he continued to retreat. Then\nshe darted from her cell, ran to him, and grasped his arm. On feeling\nher touch him, Quasimodo trembled in every limb. He raised his suppliant\neye, and seeing that she was leading him back to her quarters, his whole\nface beamed with joy and tenderness. She tried to make him enter the\ncell; but he persisted in remaining on the threshold. \"No, no,\" said he;\n\"the owl enters not the nest of the lark.\"\n\nThen she crouched down gracefully on her couch, with her goat asleep at\nher feet. Both remained motionless for several moments, considering\nin silence, she so much grace, he so much ugliness. Every moment she\ndiscovered some fresh deformity in Quasimodo. Her glance travelled from\nhis knock knees to his humped back, from his humped back to his only\neye. She could not comprehend the existence of a being so awkwardly\nfashioned. Yet there was so much sadness and so much gentleness spread\nover all this, that she began to become reconciled to it.\n\nHe was the first to break the silence. \"So you were telling me to\nreturn?\"\n\nShe made an affirmative sign of the head, and said, \"Yes.\"\n\nHe understood the motion of the head. \"Alas!\" he said, as though\nhesitating whether to finish, \"I am--I am deaf.\"\n\n\"Poor man!\" exclaimed the Bohemian, with an expression of kindly pity.\n\nHe began to smile sadly.\n\n\"You think that that was all that I lacked, do you not? Yes, I am\ndeaf, that is the way I am made. 'Tis horrible, is it not? You are so\nbeautiful!\"\n\nThere lay in the accents of the wretched man so profound a consciousness\nof his misery, that she had not the strength to say a word. Besides, he\nwould not have heard her. He went on,--\n\n\"Never have I seen my ugliness as at the present moment. When I compare\nmyself to you, I feel a very great pity for myself, poor unhappy monster\nthat I am! Tell me, I must look to you like a beast. You, you are a\nray of sunshine, a drop of dew, the song of a bird! I am something\nfrightful, neither man nor animal, I know not what, harder, more\ntrampled under foot, and more unshapely than a pebble stone!\"\n\nThen he began to laugh, and that laugh was the most heartbreaking thing\nin the world. He continued,--\n\n\"Yes, I am deaf; but you shall talk to me by gestures, by signs. I have\na master who talks with me in that way. And then, I shall very soon know\nyour wish from the movement of your lips, from your look.\"\n\n\"Well!\" she interposed with a smile, \"tell me why you saved me.\"\n\nHe watched her attentively while she was speaking.\n\n\"I understand,\" he replied. \"You ask me why I saved you. You have\nforgotten a wretch who tried to abduct you one night, a wretch to whom\nyou rendered succor on the following day on their infamous pillory. A\ndrop of water and a little pity,--that is more than I can repay with my\nlife. You have forgotten that wretch; but he remembers it.\"\n\nShe listened to him with profound tenderness. A tear swam in the eye of\nthe bellringer, but did not fall. He seemed to make it a sort of point\nof honor to retain it.\n\n\"Listen,\" he resumed, when he was no longer afraid that the tear would\nescape; \"our towers here are very high, a man who should fall from them\nwould be dead before touching the pavement; when it shall please you\nto have me fall, you will not have to utter even a word, a glance will\nsuffice.\"\n\nThen he rose. Unhappy as was the Bohemian, this eccentric being still\naroused some compassion in her. She made him a sign to remain.\n\n\"No, no,\" said he; \"I must not remain too long. I am not at my ease. It\nis out of pity that you do not turn away your eyes. I shall go to some\nplace where I can see you without your seeing me: it will be better so.\"\n\nHe drew from his pocket a little metal whistle.\n\n\"Here,\" said he, \"when you have need of me, when you wish me to come,\nwhen you will not feel too ranch horror at the sight of me, use this\nwhistle. I can hear this sound.\"\n\nHe laid the whistle on the floor and fled.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. EARTHENWARE AND CRYSTAL.\n\n\n\nDay followed day. Calm gradually returned to the soul of la Esmeralda.\nExcess of grief, like excess of joy is a violent thing which lasts but\na short time. The heart of man cannot remain long in one extremity. The\ngypsy had suffered so much, that nothing was left her but astonishment.\nWith security, hope had returned to her. She was outside the pale of\nsociety, outside the pale of life, but she had a vague feeling that it\nmight not be impossible to return to it. She was like a dead person, who\nshould hold in reserve the key to her tomb.\n\nShe felt the terrible images which had so long persecuted her,\ngradually departing. All the hideous phantoms, Pierrat Torterue, Jacques\nCharmolue, were effaced from her mind, all, even the priest.\n\nAnd then, Phoebus was alive; she was sure of it, she had seen him. To\nher the fact of Phoebus being alive was everything. After the series of\nfatal shocks which had overturned everything within her, she had found\nbut one thing intact in her soul, one sentiment,--her love for the\ncaptain. Love is like a tree; it sprouts forth of itself, sends its\nroots out deeply through our whole being, and often continues to\nflourish greenly over a heart in ruins.\n\nAnd the inexplicable point about it is that the more blind is this\npassion, the more tenacious it is. It is never more solid than when it\nhas no reason in it.\n\nLa Esmeralda did not think of the captain without bitterness, no doubt.\nNo doubt it was terrible that he also should have been deceived; that he\nshould have believed that impossible thing, that he could have conceived\nof a stab dealt by her who would have given a thousand lives for him.\nBut, after all, she must not be too angry with him for it; had she not\nconfessed her crime? had she not yielded, weak woman that she was, to\ntorture? The fault was entirely hers. She should have allowed her finger\nnails to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her. In\nshort, if she could but see Phoebus once more, for a single minute,\nonly one word would be required, one look, in order to undeceive him,\nto bring him back. She did not doubt it. She was astonished also at many\nsingular things, at the accident of Phoebus's presence on the day of the\npenance, at the young girl with whom he had been. She was his sister, no\ndoubt. An unreasonable explanation, but she contented herself with it,\nbecause she needed to believe that Phoebus still loved her, and loved\nher alone. Had he not sworn it to her? What more was needed, simple and\ncredulous as she was? And then, in this matter, were not appearances\nmuch more against her than against him? Accordingly, she waited. She\nhoped.\n\nLet us add that the church, that vast church, which surrounded her on\nevery side, which guarded her, which saved her, was itself a sovereign\ntranquillizer. The solemn lines of that architecture, the religious\nattitude of all the objects which surrounded the young girl, the serene\nand pious thoughts which emanated, so to speak, from all the pores of\nthat stone, acted upon her without her being aware of it. The edifice\nhad also sounds fraught with such benediction and such majesty,\nthat they soothed this ailing soul. The monotonous chanting of the\ncelebrants, the responses of the people to the priest, sometimes\ninarticulate, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious trembling of the\npainted windows, the organ, bursting forth like a hundred trumpets, the\nthree belfries, humming like hives of huge bees, that whole orchestra on\nwhich bounded a gigantic scale, ascending, descending incessantly\nfrom the voice of a throng to that of one bell, dulled her memory, her\nimagination, her grief. The bells, in particular, lulled her. It was\nsomething like a powerful magnetism which those vast instruments shed\nover her in great waves.\n\nThus every sunrise found her more calm, breathing better, less pale. In\nproportion as her inward wounds closed, her grace and beauty blossomed\nonce more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful. Her\nformer character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her\npretty pout, her love for her goat, her love for singing, her modesty.\nShe took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her\ncell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her\nthrough the window.\n\nWhen the thought of Phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought\nof Quasimodo. He was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole\ncommunication which remained to her with men, with the living.\nUnfortunate girl! she was more outside the world than Quasimodo. She\nunderstood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given\nher. She often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which\nshould close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to\nthe poor bellringer. He was too ugly.\n\nShe had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground.\nThis did not prevent Quasimodo from making his appearance from time to\ntime during the first few days. She did her best not to turn aside with\ntoo much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions\nor her jug of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of\nthis sort, and then he withdrew sadly.\n\nOnce he came at the moment when she was caressing Djali. He stood\npensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the goat and\nthe gypsy; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,--\n\n\"My misfortune is that I still resemble a man too much. I should like to\nbe wholly a beast like that goat.\"\n\nShe gazed at him in amazement.\n\nHe replied to the glance,--\n\n\"Oh! I well know why,\" and he went away.\n\nOn another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which\nhe never entered) at the moment when la Esmeralda was singing an old\nSpanish ballad, the words of which she did not understand, but which had\nlingered in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep\nwith it when she was a little child. At the sight of that villanous form\nwhich made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the\nyoung girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm. The unhappy\nbellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large,\nmisshapen hands with a suppliant air. \"Oh!\" he said, sorrowfully,\n\"continue, I implore you, and do not drive me away.\" She did not wish to\npain him, and resumed her lay, trembling all over. By degrees, however,\nher terror disappeared, and she yielded herself wholly to the slow and\nmelancholy air which she was singing. He remained on his knees with\nhands clasped, as in prayer, attentive, hardly breathing, his gaze\nriveted upon the gypsy's brilliant eyes.\n\nOn another occasion, he came to her with an awkward and timid air.\n\"Listen,\" he said, with an effort; \"I have something to say to you.\"\nShe made him a sign that she was listening. Then he began to sigh, half\nopened his lips, appeared for a moment to be on the point of speaking,\nthen he looked at her again, shook his head, and withdrew slowly, with\nhis brow in his hand, leaving the gypsy stupefied. Among the grotesque\npersonages sculptured on the wall, there was one to whom he was\nparticularly attached, and with which he often seemed to exchange\nfraternal glances. Once the gypsy heard him saying to it,--\n\n\"Oh! why am not I of stone, like you!\"\n\nAt last, one morning, la Esmeralda had advanced to the edge of the roof,\nand was looking into the Place over the pointed roof of Saint-Jean le\nRond. Quasimodo was standing behind her. He had placed himself in that\nposition in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the\ndispleasure of seeing him. All at once the gypsy started, a tear and a\nflash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the\nbrink of the roof and extended her arms towards the Place with anguish,\nexclaiming: \"Phoebus! come! come! a word, a single word in the name of\nheaven! Phoebus! Phoebus!\" Her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole\nperson bore the heartrending expression of a shipwrecked man who is\nmaking a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing afar\noff in a ray of sunlight on the horizon.\n\nQuasimodo leaned over the Place, and saw that the object of this tender\nand agonizing prayer was a young man, a captain, a handsome cavalier\nall glittering with arms and decorations, prancing across the end of the\nPlace, and saluting with his plume a beautiful lady who was smiling at\nhim from her balcony. However, the officer did not hear the unhappy girl\ncalling him; he was too far away.\n\nBut the poor deaf man heard. A profound sigh heaved his breast; he\nturned round; his heart was swollen with all the tears which he was\nswallowing; his convulsively-clenched fists struck against his head, and\nwhen he withdrew them there was a bunch of red hair in each hand.\n\nThe gypsy paid no heed to him. He said in a low voice as he gnashed his\nteeth,--\n\n\"Damnation! That is what one should be like! 'Tis only necessary to be\nhandsome on the outside!\"\n\nMeanwhile, she remained kneeling, and cried with extraor-dinary\nagitation,--\"Oh! there he is alighting from his horse! He is about to\nenter that house!--Phoebus!--He does not hear me! Phoebus!--How wicked\nthat woman is to speak to him at the same time with me! Phoebus!\nPhoebus!\"\n\nThe deaf man gazed at her. He understood this pantomime. The poor\nbellringer's eye filled with tears, but he let none fall. All at once he\npulled her gently by the border of her sleeve. She turned round. He had\nassumed a tranquil air; he said to her,--\n\n\"Would you like to have me bring him to you?\"\n\nShe uttered a cry of joy.\n\n\"Oh! go! hasten! run! quick! that captain! that captain! bring him to\nme! I will love you for it!\"\n\nShe clasped his knees. He could not refrain from shaking his head sadly.\n\n\"I will bring him to you,\" he said, in a weak voice. Then he turned his\nhead and plunged down the staircase with great strides, stifling with\nsobs.\n\nWhen he reached the Place, he no longer saw anything except the handsome\nhorse hitched at the door of the Gondelaurier house; the captain had\njust entered there.\n\nHe raised his eyes to the roof of the church. La Esmeralda was there\nin the same spot, in the same attitude. He made her a sad sign with his\nhead; then he planted his back against one of the stone posts of the\nGondelaurier porch, determined to wait until the captain should come\nforth.\n\nIn the Gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede\na wedding. Quasimodo beheld many people enter, but no one come out. He\ncast a glance towards the roof from time to time; the gypsy did not stir\nany more than himself. A groom came and unhitched the horse and led it\nto the stable of the house.\n\nThe entire day passed thus, Quasimodo at his post, la Esmeralda on the\nroof, Phoebus, no doubt, at the feet of Fleur-de-Lys.\n\nAt length night came, a moonless night, a dark night. Quasimodo\nfixed his gaze in vain upon la Esmeralda; soon she was no more than\na whiteness amid the twilight; then nothing. All was effaced, all was\nblack.\n\nQuasimodo beheld the front windows from top to bottom of the\nGondelaurier mansion illuminated; he saw the other casements in the\nPlace lighted one by one, he also saw them extinguished to the very\nlast, for he remained the whole evening at his post. The officer did not\ncome forth. When the last passers-by had returned home, when the windows\nof all the other houses were extinguished, Quasimodo was left entirely\nalone, entirely in the dark. There were at that time no lamps in the\nsquare before Notre-Dame.\n\nMeanwhile, the windows of the Gondelaurier mansion remained lighted,\neven after midnight. Quasimodo, motionless and attentive, beheld a\nthrong of lively, dancing shadows pass athwart the many-colored\npainted panes. Had he not been deaf, he would have heard more and more\ndistinctly, in proportion as the noise of sleeping Paris died away, a\nsound of feasting, laughter, and music in the Gondelaurier mansion.\n\nTowards one o'clock in the morning, the guests began to take their\nleave. Quasimodo, shrouded in darkness watched them all pass out through\nthe porch illuminated with torches. None of them was the captain.\n\nHe was filled with sad thoughts; at times he looked upwards into the\nair, like a person who is weary of waiting. Great black clouds, heavy,\ntorn, split, hung like crape hammocks beneath the starry dome of night.\nOne would have pronounced them spiders' webs of the vault of heaven.\n\nIn one of these moments he suddenly beheld the long window on the\nbalcony, whose stone balustrade projected above his head, open\nmysteriously. The frail glass door gave passage to two persons, and\nclosed noiselessly behind them; it was a man and a woman.\n\nIt was not without difficulty that Quasimodo succeeded in recognizing\nin the man the handsome captain, in the woman the young lady whom he\nhad seen welcome the officer in the morning from that very balcony. The\nplace was perfectly dark, and a double crimson curtain which had fallen\nacross the door the very moment it closed again, allowed no light to\nreach the balcony from the apartment.\n\nThe young man and the young girl, so far as our deaf man could judge,\nwithout hearing a single one of their words, appeared to abandon\nthemselves to a very tender t\u00c3\u00aate-a-t\u00c3\u00aate. The young girl seemed to have\nallowed the officer to make a girdle for her of his arm, and gently\nrepulsed a kiss.\n\nQuasimodo looked on from below at this scene which was all the more\npleasing to witness because it was not meant to be seen. He contemplated\nwith bitterness that beauty, that happiness. After all, nature was not\ndumb in the poor fellow, and his human sensibility, all maliciously\ncontorted as it was, quivered no less than any other. He thought of the\nmiserable portion which Providence had allotted to him; that woman and\nthe pleasure of love, would pass forever before his eyes, and that he\nshould never do anything but behold the felicity of others. But that\nwhich rent his heart most in this sight, that which mingled indignation\nwith his anger, was the thought of what the gypsy would suffer could she\nbehold it. It is true that the night was very dark, that la Esmeralda,\nif she had remained at her post (and he had no doubt of this), was very\nfar away, and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish\nthe lovers on the balcony. This consoled him.\n\nMeanwhile, their conversation grew more and more animated. The young\nlady appeared to be entreating the officer to ask nothing more of her.\nOf all this Quasimodo could distinguish only the beautiful clasped\nhands, the smiles mingled with tears, the young girl's glances directed\nto the stars, the eyes of the captain lowered ardently upon her.\n\nFortunately, for the young girl was beginning to resist but feebly, the\ndoor of the balcony suddenly opened once more and an old dame appeared;\nthe beauty seemed confused, the officer assumed an air of displeasure,\nand all three withdrew.\n\nA moment later, a horse was champing his bit under the porch, and the\nbrilliant officer, enveloped in his night cloak, passed rapidly before\nQuasimodo.\n\nThe bellringer allowed him to turn the corner of the street, then he ran\nafter him with his ape-like agility, shouting: \"Hey there! captain!\"\n\nThe captain halted.\n\n\"What wants this knave with me?\" he said, catching sight through the\ngloom of that hipshot form which ran limping after him.\n\nMeanwhile, Quasimodo had caught up with him, and had boldly grasped his\nhorse's bridle: \"Follow me, captain; there is one here who desires to\nspeak with you!\n\n\"_Cornemahom_!\" grumbled Phoebus, \"here's a villanous; ruffled bird\nwhich I fancy I have seen somewhere. Hol\u00c3\u00a0 master, will you let my\nhorse's bridle alone?\"\n\n\"Captain,\" replied the deaf man, \"do you not ask me who it is?\"\n\n\"I tell you to release my horse,\" retorted Phoebus, impatiently. \"What\nmeans the knave by clinging to the bridle of my steed? Do you take my\nhorse for a gallows?\"\n\nQuasimodo, far from releasing the bridle, prepared to force him to\nretrace his steps. Unable to comprehend the captain's resistance, he\nhastened to say to him,--\n\n\"Come, captain, 'tis a woman who is waiting for you.\" He added with an\neffort: \"A woman who loves you.\"\n\n\"A rare rascal!\" said the captain, \"who thinks me obliged to go to all\nthe women who love me! or who say they do. And what if, by chance, she\nshould resemble you, you face of a screech-owl? Tell the woman who has\nsent you that I am about to marry, and that she may go to the devil!\"\n\n\"Listen,\" exclaimed Quasimodo, thinking to overcome his hesitation with\na word, \"come, monseigneur! 'tis the gypsy whom you know!\"\n\nThis word did, indeed, produce a great effect on Phoebus, but not of the\nkind which the deaf man expected. It will be remembered that our gallant\nofficer had retired with Fleur-de-Lys several moments before Quasimodo\nhad rescued the condemned girl from the hands of Charmolue. Afterwards,\nin all his visits to the Gondelaurier mansion he had taken care not to\nmention that woman, the memory of whom was, after all, painful to him;\nand on her side, Fleur-de-Lys had not deemed it politic to tell him that\nthe gypsy was alive. Hence Phoebus believed poor \"Similar\" to be dead,\nand that a month or two had elapsed since her death. Let us add that\nfor the last few moments the captain had been reflecting on the profound\ndarkness of the night, the supernatural ugliness, the sepulchral voice\nof the strange messenger; that it was past midnight; that the street was\ndeserted, as on the evening when the surly monk had accosted him; and\nthat his horse snorted as it looked at Quasimodo.\n\n\"The gypsy!\" he exclaimed, almost frightened. \"Look here, do you come\nfrom the other world?\"\n\nAnd he laid his hand on the hilt of his dagger.\n\n\"Quick, quick,\" said the deaf man, endeavoring to drag the horse along;\n\"this way!\"\n\nPhoebus dealt him a vigorous kick in the breast.\n\nQuasimodo's eye flashed. He made a motion to fling himself on the\ncaptain. Then he drew himself up stiffly and said,--\n\n\"Oh! how happy you are to have some one who loves you!\"\n\nHe emphasized the words \"some one,\" and loosing the horse's bridle,--\n\n\"Begone!\"\n\nPhoebus spurred on in all haste, swearing. Quasimodo watched him\ndisappear in the shades of the street.\n\n\"Oh!\" said the poor deaf man, in a very low voice; \"to refuse that!\"\n\nHe re-entered Notre-Dame, lighted his lamp and climbed to the tower\nagain. The gypsy was still in the same place, as he had supposed.\n\nShe flew to meet him as far off as she could see him. \"Alone!\" she\ncried, clasping her beautiful hands sorrowfully.\n\n\"I could not find him,\" said Quasimodo coldly.\n\n\"You should have waited all night,\" she said angrily.\n\nHe saw her gesture of wrath, and understood the reproach.\n\n\"I will lie in wait for him better another time,\" he said, dropping his\nhead.\n\n\"Begone!\" she said to him.\n\nHe left her. She was displeased with him. He preferred to have her\nabuse him rather than to have afflicted her. He had kept all the pain to\nhimself.\n\nFrom that day forth, the gypsy no longer saw him. He ceased to come to\nher cell. At the most she occasionally caught a glimpse at the summit of\nthe towers, of the bellringer's face turned sadly to her. But as soon as\nshe perceived him, he disappeared.\n\nWe must admit that she was not much grieved by this voluntary absence\non the part of the poor hunchback. At the bottom of her heart she was\ngrateful to him for it. Moreover, Quasimodo did not deceive himself on\nthis point.\n\nShe no longer saw him, but she felt the presence of a good genius about\nher. Her provisions were replenished by an invisible hand during her\nslumbers. One morning she found a cage of birds on her window. There\nwas a piece of sculpture above her window which frightened her. She had\nshown this more than once in Quasimodo's presence. One morning, for\nall these things happened at night, she no longer saw it, it had been\nbroken. The person who had climbed up to that carving must have risked\nhis life.\n\nSometimes, in the evening, she heard a voice, concealed beneath the wind\nscreen of the bell tower, singing a sad, strange song, as though to lull\nher to sleep. The lines were unrhymed, such as a deaf person can make.\n\n         _Ne regarde pas la figure,\n         Jeune fille, regarde le coeur.\n         Le coeur d'un beau jeune homme est souvent difforme.\n         Il y a des coeurs ou l'amour ne se conserve pas_.\n\n         _Jeune fille, le sapin n'est pas beau,\n         N'est pas beau comme le peuplier,\n         Mais il garde son feuillage l'hiver_.\n\n         _H\u00c3\u00a9las! a quoi bon dire cela?\n         Ce qui n'est pas beau a tort d'\u00c3\u00aatre;\n         La beaut\u00c3\u00a9 n'aime que la beaut\u00c3\u00a9,\n         Avril tourne le dos a Janvier_.\n\n         _La beaut\u00c3\u00a9 est parfaite,\n         La beaut\u00c3\u00a9 peut tout,\n         La beaut\u00c3\u00a9 est la seule chose qui n'existe p\u00c3\u00a0s a demi_.\n\n         _Le corbeau ne vole que le jour,\n         Le hibou ne vole que la nuit,\n         Le cygne vole la nuit et le jour_.*\n\n\n     *  Look not at the face, young girl, look at the heart.  The\nheart of a handsome young man is often deformed. There are hearts in\nwhich love does not keep. Young girl, the pine is not beautiful; it is\nnot beautiful like the poplar, but it keeps its foliage in winter. Alas!\nWhat is the use of saying that? That which is not beautiful has no right\nto exist; beauty loves only beauty; April turns her back on January.\nBeauty is perfect, beauty can do all things, beauty is the only thing\nwhich does not exist by halves. The raven flies only by day, the owl\nflies only by night, the swan flies by day and by night.\n\n\nOne morning, on awaking, she saw on her window two vases filled with\nflowers. One was a very beautiful and very brilliant but cracked vase of\nglass. It had allowed the water with which it had been filled to escape,\nand the flowers which it contained were withered. The other was an\nearthenware pot, coarse and common, but which had preserved all its\nwater, and its flowers remained fresh and crimson.\n\nI know not whether it was done intentionally, but La Esmeralda took the\nfaded nosegay and wore it all day long upon her breast.\n\nThat day she did not hear the voice singing in the tower.\n\nShe troubled herself very little about it. She passed her days in\ncaressing Djali, in watching the door of the Gondelaurier house, in\ntalking to herself about Phoebus, and in crumbling up her bread for the\nswallows.\n\nShe had entirely ceased to see or hear Quasimodo. The poor bellringer\nseemed to have disappeared from the church. One night, nevertheless,\nwhen she was not asleep, but was thinking of her handsome captain, she\nheard something breathing near her cell. She rose in alarm, and saw by\nthe light of the moon, a shapeless mass lying across her door on the\noutside. It was Quasimodo asleep there upon the stones.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE KEY TO THE RED DOOR.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, public minor had informed the archdeacon of the\nmiraculous manner in which the gypsy had been saved. When he learned it,\nhe knew not what his sensations were. He had reconciled himself to la\nEsmeralda's death. In that matter he was tranquil; he had reached the\nbottom of personal suffering. The human heart (Dora Claude had meditated\nupon these matters) can contain only a certain quantity of despair.\nWhen the sponge is saturated, the sea may pass over it without causing a\nsingle drop more to enter it.\n\nNow, with la Esmeralda dead, the sponge was soaked, all was at an end on\nthis earth for Dom Claude. But to feel that she was alive, and Phoebus\nalso, meant that tortures, shocks, alternatives, life, were beginning\nagain. And Claude was weary of all this.\n\nWhen he heard this news, he shut himself in his cell in the cloister. He\nappeared neither at the meetings of the chapter nor at the services. He\nclosed his door against all, even against the bishop. He remained thus\nimmured for several weeks. He was believed to be ill. And so he was, in\nfact.\n\nWhat did he do while thus shut up? With what thoughts was the\nunfortunate man contending? Was he giving final battle to his formidable\npassion? Was he concocting a final plan of death for her and of\nperdition for himself?\n\nHis Jehan, his cherished brother, his spoiled child, came once to his\ndoor, knocked, swore, entreated, gave his name half a score of times.\nClaude did not open.\n\nHe passed whole days with his face close to the panes of his window.\nFrom that window, situated in the cloister, he could see la Esmeralda's\nchamber. He often saw herself with her goat, sometimes with Quasimodo.\nHe remarked the little attentions of the ugly deaf man, his obedience,\nhis delicate and submissive ways with the gypsy. He recalled, for he had\na good memory, and memory is the tormentor of the jealous, he recalled\nthe singular look of the bellringer, bent on the dancer upon a certain\nevening. He asked himself what motive could have impelled Quasimodo to\nsave her. He was the witness of a thousand little scenes between the\ngypsy and the deaf man, the pantomime of which, viewed from afar and\ncommented on by his passion, appeared very tender to him. He distrusted\nthe capriciousness of women. Then he felt a jealousy which he could\nnever have believed possible awakening within him, a jealousy which made\nhim redden with shame and indignation: \"One might condone the captain,\nbut this one!\" This thought upset him.\n\nHis nights were frightful. As soon as he learned that the gypsy was\nalive, the cold ideas of spectre and tomb which had persecuted him for\na whole day vanished, and the flesh returned to goad him. He turned and\ntwisted on his couch at the thought that the dark-skinned maiden was so\nnear him.\n\nEvery night his delirious imagination represented la Esmeralda to him in\nall the attitudes which had caused his blood to boil most. He beheld her\noutstretched upon the poniarded captain, her eyes closed, her beautiful\nbare throat covered with Phoebus's blood, at that moment of bliss when\nthe archdeacon had imprinted on her pale lips that kiss whose burn the\nunhappy girl, though half dead, had felt. He beheld her, again, stripped\nby the savage hands of the torturers, allowing them to bare and to\nenclose in the boot with its iron screw, her tiny foot, her delicate\nrounded leg, her white and supple knee. Again he beheld that ivory knee\nwhich alone remained outside of Torterue's horrible apparatus. Lastly,\nhe pictured the young girl in her shift, with the rope about her neck,\nshoulders bare, feet bare, almost nude, as he had seen her on that last\nday. These images of voluptuousness made him clench his fists, and a\nshiver run along his spine.\n\nOne night, among others, they heated so cruelly his virgin and priestly\nblood, that he bit his pillow, leaped from his bed, flung on a surplice\nover his shirt, and left his cell, lamp in hand, half naked, wild, his\neyes aflame.\n\nHe knew where to find the key to the red door, which connected the\ncloister with the church, and he always had about him, as the reader\nknows, the key of the staircase leading to the towers.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. CONTINUATION OF THE KEY TO THE RED DOOR.\n\n\n\nThat night, la Esmeralda had fallen asleep in her cell, full of\noblivion, of hope, and of sweet thoughts. She had already been asleep\nfor some time, dreaming as always, of Phoebus, when it seemed to her\nthat she heard a noise near her. She slept lightly and uneasily, the\nsleep of a bird; a mere nothing waked her. She opened her eyes. The\nnight was very dark. Nevertheless, she saw a figure gazing at her\nthrough the window; a lamp lighted up this apparition. The moment that\nthe figure saw that la Esmeralda had perceived it, it blew out the\nlamp. But the young girl had had time to catch a glimpse of it; her eyes\nclosed again with terror.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said in a faint voice, \"the priest!\"\n\nAll her past unhappiness came back to her like a flash of lightning. She\nfell back on her bed, chilled.\n\nA moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder\nso that she straightened herself up in a sitting posture, wide awake and\nfurious.\n\nThe priest had just slipped in beside her. He encircled her with both\narms.\n\nShe tried to scream and could not.\n\n\"Begone, monster! begone assassin!\" she said, in a voice which was low\nand trembling with wrath and terror.\n\n\"Mercy! mercy!\" murmured the priest, pressing his lips to her shoulder.\n\nShe seized his bald head by its remnant of hair and tried to thrust\naside his kisses as though they had been bites.\n\n\"Mercy!\" repeated the unfortunate man. \"If you but knew what my love for\nyou is! 'Tis fire, melted lead, a thousand daggers in my heart.\"\n\nShe stopped his two arms with superhuman force.\n\n\"Let me go,\" she said, \"or I will spit in your face!\"\n\nHe released her. \"Vilify me, strike me, be malicious! Do what you will!\nBut have mercy! love me!\"\n\nThen she struck him with the fury of a child. She made her beautiful\nhands stiff to bruise his face. \"Begone, demon!\"\n\n\"Love me! love mepity!\" cried the poor priest returning her blows with\ncaresses.\n\nAll at once she felt him stronger than herself.\n\n\"There must be an end to this!\" he said, gnashing his teeth.\n\nShe was conquered, palpitating in his arms, and in his power. She felt a\nwanton hand straying over her. She made a last effort, and began to cry:\n\"Help! Help! A vampire! a vampire!\"\n\nNothing came. Djali alone was awake and bleating with anguish.\n\n\"Hush!\" said the panting priest.\n\nAll at once, as she struggled and crawled on the floor, the gypsy's hand\ncame in contact with something cold and metal-lic-it was Quasimodo's\nwhistle. She seized it with a convulsive hope, raised it to her lips and\nblew with all the strength that she had left. The whistle gave a clear,\npiercing sound.\n\n\"What is that?\" said the priest.\n\nAlmost at the same instant he felt himself raised by a vigorous arm. The\ncell was dark; he could not distinguish clearly who it was that held\nhim thus; but he heard teeth chattering with rage, and there was just\nsufficient light scattered among the gloom to allow him to see above his\nhead the blade of a large knife.\n\nThe priest fancied that he perceived the form of Quasimodo. He assumed\nthat it could be no one but he. He remembered to have stumbled, as\nhe entered, over a bundle which was stretched across the door on the\noutside. But, as the newcomer did not utter a word, he knew not what\nto think. He flung himself on the arm which held the knife, crying:\n\"Quasimodo!\" He forgot, at that moment of distress, that Quasimodo was\ndeaf.\n\nIn a twinkling, the priest was overthrown and a leaden knee rested on\nhis breast.\n\nFrom the angular imprint of that knee he recognized Quasimodo; but what\nwas to be done? how could he make the other recognize him? the darkness\nrendered the deaf man blind.\n\nHe was lost. The young girl, pitiless as an enraged tigress, did not\nintervene to save him. The knife was approaching his head; the\nmoment was critical. All at once, his adversary seemed stricken with\nhesitation.\n\n\"No blood on her!\" he said in a dull voice.\n\nIt was, in fact, Quasimodo's voice.\n\nThen the priest felt a large hand dragging him feet first out of the\ncell; it was there that he was to die. Fortunately for him, the moon had\nrisen a few moments before.\n\nWhen they had passed through the door of the cell, its pale rays fell\nupon the priest's countenance. Quasimodo looked him full in the face, a\ntrembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.\n\nThe gypsy, who had advanced to the threshold of her cell, beheld\nwith surprise their roles abruptly changed. It was now the priest who\nmenaced, Quasimodo who was the suppliant.\n\nThe priest, who was overwhelming the deaf man with gestures of wrath and\nreproach, made the latter a violent sign to retire.\n\nThe deaf man dropped his head, then he came and knelt at the gypsy's\ndoor,--\"Monseigneur,\" he said, in a grave and resigned voice, \"you shall\ndo all that you please afterwards, but kill me first.\"\n\nSo saying, he presented his knife to the priest. The priest, beside\nhimself, was about to seize it. But the young girl was quicker than be;\nshe wrenched the knife from Quasimodo's hands and burst into a frantic\nlaugh,--\"Approach,\" she said to the priest.\n\nShe held the blade high. The priest remained undecided.\n\nShe would certainly have struck him.\n\nThen she added with a pitiless expression, well aware that she was about\nto pierce the priest's heart with thousands of red-hot irons,--\n\n\"Ah! I know that Phoebus is not dead!\"\n\nThe priest overturned Quasimodo on the floor with a kick, and, quivering\nwith rage, darted back under the vault of the staircase.\n\nWhen he was gone, Quasimodo picked up the whistle which had just saved\nthe gypsy.\n\n\"It was getting rusty,\" he said, as he handed it back to her; then he\nleft her alone.\n\nThe young girl, deeply agitated by this violent scene, fell back\nexhausted on her bed, and began to sob and weep. Her horizon was\nbecoming gloomy once more.\n\nThe priest had groped his way back to his cell.\n\nIt was settled. Dom Claude was jealous of Quasimodo!\n\nHe repeated with a thoughtful air his fatal words: \"No one shall have\nher.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK TENTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. GRINGOIRE HAS MANY GOOD IDEAS IN SUCCESSION.--RUE DES\nBERNARDINS.\n\n\n\nAs soon as Pierre Gringoire had seen how this whole affair was\nturning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other\ndisagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy, he had\nnot cared to identify himself with the matter further. The outcasts\nwith whom he had remained, reflecting that, after all, it was the best\ncompany in Paris,--the outcasts had continued to interest themselves in\nbehalf of the gypsy. He had thought it very simple on the part of\npeople who had, like herself, nothing else in prospect but Charmolue and\nTorterue, and who, unlike himself, did not gallop through the regions\nof imagination between the wings of Pegasus. From their remarks, he\nhad learned that his wife of the broken crock had taken refuge in\nNotre-Dame, and he was very glad of it. But he felt no temptation to\ngo and see her there. He meditated occasionally on the little goat, and\nthat was all. Moreover, he was busy executing feats of strength during\nthe day for his living, and at night he was engaged in composing a\nmemorial against the Bishop of Paris, for he remembered having been\ndrenched by the wheels of his mills, and he cherished a grudge against\nhim for it. He also occupied himself with annotating the fine work of\nBaudry-le-Rouge, Bishop of Noyon and Tournay, _De Cupa Petrarum_, which\nhad given him a violent passion for architecture, an inclination which\nhad replaced in his heart his passion for hermeticism, of which it was,\nmoreover, only a natural corollary, since there is an intimate relation\nbetween hermeticism and masonry. Gringoire had passed from the love of\nan idea to the love of the form of that idea.\n\nOne day he had halted near Saint Germain-l'Auxerrois, at the corner of\na mansion called \"For-l'Ev\u00c3\u00aaque\" (the Bishop's Tribunal), which stood\nopposite another called \"For-le-Roi\" (the King's Tribunal). At this\nFor-l'Ev\u00c3\u00aaque, there was a charming chapel of the fourteenth century,\nwhose apse was on the street. Gringoire was devoutly examining its\nexterior sculptures. He was in one of those moments of egotistical,\nexclusive, supreme, enjoyment when the artist beholds nothing in the\nworld but art, and the world in art. All at once he feels a hand laid\ngravely on his shoulder. He turns round. It was his old friend, his\nformer master, monsieur the archdeacon.\n\nHe was stupefied. It was a long time since he had seen the archdeacon,\nand Dom Claude was one of those solemn and impassioned men, a meeting\nwith whom always upsets the equilibrium of a sceptical philosopher.\n\nThe archdeacon maintained silence for several minutes, during which\nGringoire had time to observe him. He found Dom Claude greatly changed;\npale as a winter's morning, with hollow eyes, and hair almost white. The\npriest broke the silence at length, by saying, in a tranquil but glacial\ntone,--\n\n\"How do you do, Master Pierre?\"\n\n\"My health?\" replied Gringoire. \"Eh! eh! one can say both one thing and\nanother on that score. Still, it is good, on the whole. I take not too\nmuch of anything. You know, master, that the secret of keeping well,\naccording to Hippocrates; _id est: cibi, potus, somni, venus, omnia\nmoderata sint_.\"\n\n\"So you have no care, Master Pierre?\" resumed the archdeacon, gazing\nintently at Gringoire.\n\n\"None, i' faith!\"\n\n\"And what are you doing now?\"\n\n\"You see, master. I am examining the chiselling of these stones, and the\nmanner in which yonder bas-relief is thrown out.\"\n\nThe priest began to smile with that bitter smile which raises only one\ncorner of the mouth.\n\n\"And that amuses you?\"\n\n\"'Tis paradise!\" exclaimed Gringoire. And leaning over the sculptures\nwith the fascinated air of a demonstrator of living phenomena: \"Do\nyou not think, for instance, that yon metamorphosis in bas-relief is\nexecuted with much adroitness, delicacy and patience? Observe that\nslender column. Around what capital have you seen foliage more tender\nand better caressed by the chisel. Here are three raised bosses of\nJean Maillevin. They are not the finest works of this great master.\nNevertheless, the naivete, the sweetness of the faces, the gayety of the\nattitudes and draperies, and that inexplicable charm which is mingled\nwith all the defects, render the little figures very diverting and\ndelicate, perchance, even too much so. You think that it is not\ndiverting?\"\n\n\"Yes, certainly!\" said the priest.\n\n\"And if you were to see the interior of the chapel!\" resumed the poet,\nwith his garrulous enthusiasm. \"Carvings everywhere. 'Tis as thickly\nclustered as the head of a cabbage! The apse is of a very devout, and so\npeculiar a fashion that I have never beheld anything like it elsewhere!\"\n\nDom Claude interrupted him,--\n\n\"You are happy, then?\"\n\nGringoire replied warmly;--\n\n\"On my honor, yes! First I loved women, then animals. Now I love stones.\nThey are quite as amusing as women and animals, and less treacherous.\"\n\nThe priest laid his hand on his brow. It was his habitual gesture.\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Stay!\" said Gringoire, \"one has one's pleasures!\" He took the arm of\nthe priest, who let him have his way, and made him enter the staircase\nturret of For-l'Ev\u00c3\u00aaque. \"Here is a staircase! every time that I see it I\nam happy. It is of the simplest and rarest manner of steps in Paris. All\nthe steps are bevelled underneath. Its beauty and simplicity consist\nin the interspacing of both, being a foot or more wide, which are\ninterlaced, interlocked, fitted together, enchained enchased, interlined\none upon another, and bite into each other in a manner that is truly\nfirm and graceful.\"\n\n\"And you desire nothing?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And you regret nothing?\"\n\n\"Neither regret nor desire. I have arranged my mode of life.\"\n\n\"What men arrange,\" said Claude, \"things disarrange.\"\n\n\"I am a Pyrrhonian philosopher,\" replied Gringoire, \"and I hold all\nthings in equilibrium.\"\n\n\"And how do you earn your living?\"\n\n\"I still make epics and tragedies now and then; but that which brings me\nin most is the industry with which you are acquainted, master; carrying\npyramids of chairs in my teeth.\"\n\n\"The trade is but a rough one for a philosopher.\"\n\n\"'Tis still equilibrium,\" said Gringoire. \"When one has an idea, one\nencounters it in everything.\"\n\n\"I know that,\" replied the archdeacon.\n\nAfter a silence, the priest resumed,--\n\n\"You are, nevertheless, tolerably poor?\"\n\n\"Poor, yes; unhappy, no.\"\n\nAt that moment, a trampling of horses was heard, and our two\ninterlocutors beheld defiling at the end of the street, a company of the\nking's unattached archers, their lances borne high, an officer at\ntheir head. The cavalcade was brilliant, and its march resounded on the\npavement.\n\n\"How you gaze at that officer!\" said Gringoire, to the archdeacon.\n\n\"Because I think I recognize him.\"\n\n\"What do you call him?\"\n\n\"I think,\" said Claude, \"that his name is Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers.\"\n\n\"Phoebus! A curious name! There is also a Phoebus, Comte de Foix. I\nremember having known a wench who swore only by the name of Phoebus.\"\n\n\"Come away from here,\" said the priest. \"I have something to say to\nyou.\"\n\nFrom the moment of that troop's passing, some agitation had pierced\nthrough the archdeacon's glacial envelope. He walked on. Gringoire\nfollowed him, being accustomed to obey him, like all who had once\napproached that man so full of ascendency. They reached in silence the\nRue des Bernardins, which was nearly deserted. Here Dom Claude paused.\n\n\"What have you to say to me, master?\" Gringoire asked him.\n\n\"Do you not think that the dress of those cavaliers whom we have just\nseen is far handsomer than yours and mine?\"\n\nGringoire tossed his head.\n\n\"I' faith! I love better my red and yellow jerkin, than those scales\nof iron and steel. A fine pleasure to produce, when you walk, the same\nnoise as the Quay of Old Iron, in an earthquake!\"\n\n\"So, Gringoire, you have never cherished envy for those handsome fellows\nin their military doublets?\"\n\n\"Envy for what, monsieur the archdeacon? their strength, their armor,\ntheir discipline? Better philosophy and independence in rags. I prefer\nto be the head of a fly rather than the tail of a lion.\"\n\n\"That is singular,\" said the priest dreamily. \"Yet a handsome uniform is\na beautiful thing.\"\n\nGringoire, perceiving that he was in a pensive mood, quitted him to go\nand admire the porch of a neighboring house. He came back clapping his\nhands.\n\n\"If you were less engrossed with the fine clothes of men of war,\nmonsieur the archdeacon, I would entreat you to come and see this door.\nI have always said that the house of the Sieur Aubry had the most superb\nentrance in the world.\"\n\n\"Pierre Gringoire,\" said the archdeacon, \"What have you done with that\nlittle gypsy dancer?\"\n\n\"La Esmeralda? You change the conversation very abruptly.\"\n\n\"Was she not your wife?\"\n\n\"Yes, by virtue of a broken crock. We were to have four years of it. By\nthe way,\" added Gringoire, looking at the archdeacon in a half bantering\nway, \"are you still thinking of her?\"\n\n\"And you think of her no longer?\"\n\n\"Very little. I have so many things. Good heavens, how pretty that\nlittle goat was!\"\n\n\"Had she not saved your life?\"\n\n\"'Tis true, pardieu!\"\n\n\"Well, what has become of her? What have you done with her?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you. I believe that they have hanged her.\"\n\n\"You believe so?\"\n\n\"I am not sure. When I saw that they wanted to hang people, I retired\nfrom the game.\"\n\n\"That is all you know of it?\"\n\n\"Wait a bit. I was told that she had taken refuge in Notre-Dame, and\nthat she was safe there, and I am delighted to hear it, and I have not\nbeen able to discover whether the goat was saved with her, and that is\nall I know.\"\n\n\"I will tell you more,\" cried Dom Claude; and his voice, hitherto low,\nslow, and almost indistinct, turned to thunder. \"She has in fact, taken\nrefuge in Notre-Dame. But in three days justice will reclaim her, and\nshe will be hanged on the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. There is a decree of parliament.\"\n\n\"That's annoying,\" said Gringoire.\n\nThe priest, in an instant, became cold and calm again.\n\n\"And who the devil,\" resumed the poet, \"has amused himself with\nsoliciting a decree of reintegration? Why couldn't they leave parliament\nin peace? What harm does it do if a poor girl takes shelter under the\nflying buttresses of Notre-Dame, beside the swallows' nests?\"\n\n\"There are satans in this world,\" remarked the archdeacon.\n\n\"'Tis devilish badly done,\" observed Gringoire.\n\nThe archdeacon resumed after a silence,--\n\n\"So, she saved your life?\"\n\n\"Among my good friends the outcasts. A little more or a little less and\nI should have been hanged. They would have been sorry for it to-day.\"\n\n\"Would not you like to do something for her?\"\n\n\"I ask nothing better, Dom Claude; but what if I entangle myself in some\nvillanous affair?\"\n\n\"What matters it?\"\n\n\"Bah! what matters it? You are good, master, that you are! I have two\ngreat works already begun.\"\n\nThe priest smote his brow. In spite of the calm which he affected, a\nviolent gesture betrayed his internal convulsions from time to time.\n\n\"How is she to be saved?\"\n\nGringoire said to him; \"Master, I will reply to you; _Il padelt_, which\nmeans in Turkish, 'God is our hope.'\"\n\n\"How is she to be saved?\" repeated Claude dreamily.\n\nGringoire smote his brow in his turn.\n\n\"Listen, master. I have imagination; I will devise expedients for you.\nWhat if one were to ask her pardon from the king?\"\n\n\"Of Louis XI.! A pardon!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"To take the tiger's bone from him!\"\n\nGringoire began to seek fresh expedients.\n\n\"Well, stay! Shall I address to the midwives a request accompanied by\nthe declaration that the girl is with child!\"\n\nThis made the priest's hollow eye flash.\n\n\"With child! knave! do you know anything of this?\"\n\nGringoire was alarmed by his air. He hastened to say, \"Oh, no, not I!\nOur marriage was a real _forismaritagium_. I stayed outside. But one\nmight obtain a respite, all the same.\"\n\n\"Madness! Infamy! Hold your tongue!\"\n\n\"You do wrong to get angry,\" muttered Gringoire. \"One obtains a respite;\nthat does no harm to any one, and allows the midwives, who are poor\nwomen, to earn forty deniers parisis.\"\n\nThe priest was not listening to him!\n\n\"But she must leave that place, nevertheless!\" he murmured, \"the decree\nis to be executed within three days. Moreover, there will be no decree;\nthat Quasimodo! Women have very depraved tastes!\" He raised his voice:\n\"Master Pierre, I have reflected well; there is but one means of safety\nfor her.\"\n\n\"What? I see none myself.\"\n\n\"Listen, Master Pierre, remember that you owe your life to her. I will\ntell you my idea frankly. The church is watched night and day; only\nthose are allowed to come out, who have been seen to enter. Hence\nyou can enter. You will come. I will lead you to her. You will change\nclothes with her. She will take your doublet; you will take her\npetticoat.\"\n\n\"So far, it goes well,\" remarked the philosopher, \"and then?\"\n\n\"And then? she will go forth in your garments; you will remain with\nhers. You will be hanged, perhaps, but she will be saved.\"\n\nGringoire scratched his ear, with a very serious air. \"Stay!\" said he,\n\"that is an idea which would never have occurred to me unaided.\"\n\nAt Dom Claude's proposition, the open and benign face of the poet had\nabruptly clouded over, like a smiling Italian landscape, when an unlucky\nsquall comes up and dashes a cloud across the sun.\n\n\"Well! Gringoire, what say you to the means?\"\n\n\"I say, master, that I shall not be hanged, perchance, but that I shall\nbe hanged indubitably.\n\n\"That concerns us not.\"\n\n\"The deuce!\" said Gringoire.\n\n\"She has saved your life. 'Tis a debt that you are discharging.\"\n\n\"There are a great many others which I do not discharge.\"\n\n\"Master Pierre, it is absolutely necessary.\"\n\nThe archdeacon spoke imperiously.\n\n\"Listen, Dom Claude,\" replied the poet in utter consternation. \"You cling\nto that idea, and you are wrong. I do not see why I should get myself\nhanged in some one else's place.\"\n\n\"What have you, then, which attaches you so strongly to life?\"\n\n\"Oh! a thousand reasons!\"\n\n\"What reasons, if you please?\"\n\n\"What? The air, the sky, the morning, the evening, the moonlight, my\ngood friends the thieves, our jeers with the old hags of go-betweens,\nthe fine architecture of Paris to study, three great books to make, one\nof them being against the bishops and his mills; and how can I tell all?\nAnaxagoras said that he was in the world to admire the sun. And then,\nfrom morning till night, I have the happiness of passing all my days\nwith a man of genius, who is myself, which is very agreeable.\"\n\n\"A head fit for a mule bell!\" muttered the archdeacon. \"Oh! tell me who\npreserved for you that life which you render so charming to yourself? To\nwhom do you owe it that you breathe that air, behold that sky, and can\nstill amuse your lark's mind with your whimsical nonsense and madness?\nWhere would you be, had it not been for her? Do you then desire that\nshe through whom you are alive, should die? that she should die, that\nbeautiful, sweet, adorable creature, who is necessary to the light of\nthe world and more divine than God, while you, half wise, and half fool,\na vain sketch of something, a sort of vegetable, which thinks that it\nwalks, and thinks that it thinks, you will continue to live with the\nlife which you have stolen from her, as useless as a candle in broad\ndaylight? Come, have a little pity, Gringoire; be generous in your turn;\nit was she who set the example.\"\n\nThe priest was vehement. Gringoire listened to him at first with an\nundecided air, then he became touched, and wound up with a grimace which\nmade his pallid face resemble that of a new-born infant with an attack\nof the colic.\n\n\"You are pathetic!\" said he, wiping away a tear. \"Well! I will think\nabout it. That's a queer idea of yours.--After all,\" he continued after\na pause, \"who knows? perhaps they will not hang me. He who becomes\nbetrothed does not always marry. When they find me in that little\nlodging so grotesquely muffled in petticoat and coif, perchance they\nwill burst with laughter. And then, if they do hang me,--well! the\nhalter is as good a death as any. 'Tis a death worthy of a sage who has\nwavered all his life; a death which is neither flesh nor fish, like the\nmind of a veritable sceptic; a death all stamped with Pyrrhonism and\nhesitation, which holds the middle station betwixt heaven and earth,\nwhich leaves you in suspense. 'Tis a philosopher's death, and I was\ndestined thereto, perchance. It is magnificent to die as one has lived.\"\n\nThe priest interrupted him: \"Is it agreed.\"\n\n\"What is death, after all?\" pursued Gringoire with exaltation. \"A\ndisagreeable moment, a toll-gate, the passage of little to nothingness.\nSome one having asked Cercidas, the Megalopolitan, if he were willing to\ndie: 'Why not?' he replied; 'for after my death I shall see those great\nmen, Pythagoras among the philosophers, Hecataeus among historians,\nHomer among poets, Olympus among musicians.'\"\n\nThe archdeacon gave him his hand: \"It is settled, then? You will come\nto-morrow?\"\n\nThis gesture recalled Gringoire to reality.\n\n\"Ah! i' faith no!\" he said in the tone of a man just waking up. \"Be\nhanged! 'tis too absurd. I will not.\"\n\n\"Farewell, then!\" and the archdeacon added between his teeth: \"I'll find\nyou again!\"\n\n\"I do not want that devil of a man to find me,\" thought Gringoire; and\nhe ran after Dom Claude. \"Stay, monsieur the archdeacon, no ill-feeling\nbetween old friends! You take an interest in that girl, my wife, I mean,\nand 'tis well. You have devised a scheme to get her out of Notre-Dame,\nbut your way is extremely disagreeable to me, Gringoire. If I had only\nanother one myself! I beg to say that a luminous inspiration has just\noccurred to me. If I possessed an expedient for extricating her from\na dilemma, without compromising my own neck to the extent of a single\nrunning knot, what would you say to it? Will not that suffice you? Is it\nabsolutely necessary that I should be hanged, in order that you may be\ncontent?\"\n\nThe priest tore out the buttons of his cassock with impatience: \"Stream\nof words! What is your plan?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" resumed Gringoire, talking to himself and touching his nose with\nhis forefinger in sign of meditation,--\"that's it!--The thieves are\nbrave fellows!--The tribe of Egypt love her!--They will rise at the\nfirst word!--Nothing easier!--A sudden stroke.--Under cover of the\ndisorder, they will easily carry her off!--Beginning to-morrow evening.\nThey will ask nothing better.\n\n\"The plan! speak,\" cried the archdeacon shaking him.\n\nGringoire turned majestically towards him: \"Leave me! You see that I am\ncomposing.\" He meditated for a few moments more, then began to clap his\nhands over his thought, crying: \"Admirable! success is sure!\"\n\n\"The plan!\" repeated Claude in wrath.\n\nGringoire was radiant.\n\n\"Come, that I may tell you that very softly. 'Tis a truly gallant\ncounter-plot, which will extricate us all from the matter. Pardieu, it\nmust be admitted that I am no fool.\"\n\nHe broke off.\n\n\"Oh, by the way! is the little goat with the wench?\"\n\n\"Yes. The devil take you!\"\n\n\"They would have hanged it also, would they not?\"\n\n\"What is that to me?\"\n\n\"Yes, they would have hanged it. They hanged a sow last month. The\nheadsman loveth that; he eats the beast afterwards. Take my pretty\nDjali! Poor little lamb!\"\n\n\"Malediction!\" exclaimed Dom Claude. \"You are the executioner. What\nmeans of safety have you found, knave? Must your idea be extracted with\nthe forceps?\"\n\n\"Very fine, master, this is it.\"\n\nGringoire bent his head to the archdeacon's head and spoke to him in a\nvery low voice, casting an uneasy glance the while from one end to the\nother of the street, though no one was passing. When he had finished,\nDom Claude took his hand and said coldly: \"'Tis well. Farewell until\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Until to-morrow,\" repeated Gringoire. And, while the archdeacon was\ndisappearing in one direction, he set off in the other, saying to\nhimself in a low voice: \"Here's a grand affair, Monsieur Pierre\nGringoire. Never mind! 'Tis not written that because one is of small\naccount one should take fright at a great enterprise. Bitou carried a\ngreat bull on his shoulders; the water-wagtails, the warblers, and the\nbuntings traverse the ocean.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. TURN VAGABOND.\n\n\n\nOn re-entering the cloister, the archdeacon found at the door of his\ncell his brother Jehan du Moulin, who was waiting for him, and who had\nbeguiled the tedium of waiting by drawing on the wall with a bit of\ncharcoal, a profile of his elder brother, enriched with a monstrous\nnose.\n\nDom Claude hardly looked at his brother; his thoughts were elsewhere.\nThat merry scamp's face whose beaming had so often restored serenity\nto the priest's sombre physiognomy, was now powerless to melt the gloom\nwhich grew more dense every day over that corrupted, mephitic, and\nstagnant soul.\n\n\"Brother,\" said Jehan timidly, \"I am come to see you.\"\n\nThe archdeacon did not even raise his eyes.\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Brother,\" resumed the hypocrite, \"you are so good to me, and you give\nme such wise counsels that I always return to you.\"\n\n\"What next?\"\n\n\"Alas! brother, you were perfectly right when you said to me,--\"Jehan!\nJehan! _cessat doctorum doctrina, discipulorum disciplina_. Jehan,\nbe wise, Jehan, be learned, Jehan, pass not the night outside of the\ncollege without lawful occasion and due leave of the master. Cudgel\nnot the Picards: _noli, Joannes, verberare Picardos_. Rot not like an\nunlettered ass, _quasi asinus illitteratus_, on the straw seats of the\nschool. Jehan, allow yourself to be punished at the discretion of the\nmaster. Jehan go every evening to chapel, and sing there an anthem\nwith verse and orison to Madame the glorious Virgin Mary.\"--Alas! what\nexcellent advice was that!\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Brother, you behold a culprit, a criminal, a wretch, a libertine, a man\nof enormities! My dear brother, Jehan hath made of your counsels straw\nand dung to trample under foot. I have been well chastised for it, and\nGod is extraordinarily just. As long as I had money, I feasted, I lead a\nmad and joyous life. Oh! how ugly and crabbed behind is debauch which\nis so charming in front! Now I have no longer a blank; I have sold my\nnapery, my shirt and my towels; no more merry life! The beautiful candle\nis extinguished and I have henceforth, only a wretched tallow dip\nwhich smokes in my nose. The wenches jeer at me. I drink water.--I am\noverwhelmed with remorse and with creditors.\n\n\"The rest?\" said the archdeacon.\n\n\"Alas! my very dear brother, I should like to settle down to a better\nlife. I come to you full of contrition, I am penitent. I make my\nconfession. I beat my breast violently. You are quite right in wishing\nthat I should some day become a licentiate and sub-monitor in the\ncollege of Torchi. At the present moment I feel a magnificent vocation\nfor that profession. But I have no more ink and I must buy some; I\nhave no more paper, I have no more books, and I must buy some. For this\npurpose, I am greatly in need of a little money, and I come to you,\nbrother, with my heart full of contrition.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the scholar. \"A little money.\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\nThen the scholar said, with an air which was both grave and resolute:\n\"Well, brother, I am sorry to be obliged to tell you that very fine\noffers and propositions are being made to me in another quarter.\nYou will not give me any money? No. In that case I shall become a\nprofessional vagabond.\"\n\nAs he uttered these monstrous words, he assumed the mien of Ajax,\nexpecting to see the lightnings descend upon his head.\n\nThe archdeacon said coldly to him,--\"Become a vagabond.\"\n\nJehan made him a deep bow, and descended the cloister stairs, whistling.\n\nAt the moment when he was passing through the courtyard of the cloister,\nbeneath his brother's window, he heard that window open, raised his eyes\nand beheld the archdeacon's severe head emerge.\n\n\"Go to the devil!\" said Dom Claude; \"here is the last money which you\nwill get from me?\"\n\nAt the same time, the priest flung Jehan a purse, which gave the scholar\na big bump on the forehead, and with which Jehan retreated, both vexed\nand content, like a dog who had been stoned with marrow bones.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. LONG LIVE MIRTH.\n\n\n\nThe reader has probably not forgotten that a part of the Cour de\nMiracles was enclosed by the ancient wall which surrounded the city, a\ngoodly number of whose towers had begun, even at that epoch, to fall to\nruin. One of these towers had been converted into a pleasure resort by\nthe vagabonds. There was a drain-shop in the underground story, and the\nrest in the upper stories. This was the most lively, and consequently\nthe most hideous, point of the whole outcast den. It was a sort of\nmonstrous hive, which buzzed there night and day. At night, when the\nremainder of the beggar horde slept, when there was no longer a window\nlighted in the dingy fa\u00c3\u00a7ades of the Place, when not a cry was any longer\nto be heard proceeding from those innumerable families, those ant-hills\nof thieves, of wenches, and stolen or bastard children, the merry tower\nwas still recognizable by the noise which it made, by the scarlet light\nwhich, flashing simultaneously from the air-holes, the windows, the\nfissures in the cracked walls, escaped, so to speak, from its every\npore.\n\nThe cellar then, was the dram-shop. The descent to it was through a\nlow door and by a staircase as steep as a classic Alexandrine. Over the\ndoor, by way of a sign there hung a marvellous daub, representing new\nsons and dead chickens,* with this, pun below: _Aux sonneurs pour les\ntr\u00c3\u00a9pass\u00c3\u00a9s_,--The wringers for the dead.\n\n\n     *  _Sols neufs: poulets tu\u00c3\u00a9s_.\n\nOne evening when the curfew was sounding from all the belfries in Paris,\nthe sergeants of the watch might have observed, had it been granted to\nthem to enter the formidable Court of Miracles, that more tumult than\nusual was in progress in the vagabonds' tavern, that more drinking was\nbeing done, and louder swearing. Outside in the Place, there, were many\ngroups conversing in low tones, as when some great plan is being framed,\nand here and there a knave crouching down engaged in sharpening a\nvillanous iron blade on a paving-stone.\n\nMeanwhile, in the tavern itself, wine and gaming offered such a powerful\ndiversion to the ideas which occupied the vagabonds' lair that evening,\nthat it would have been difficult to divine from the remarks of the\ndrinkers, what was the matter in hand. They merely wore a gayer air than\nwas their wont, and some weapon could be seen glittering between the\nlegs of each of them,--a sickle, an axe, a big two-edged sword or the\nhook of an old hackbut.\n\nThe room, circular in form, was very spacious; but the tables were\nso thickly set and the drinkers so numerous, that all that the tavern\ncontained, men, women, benches, beer-jugs, all that were drinking, all\nthat were sleeping, all that were playing, the well, the lame, seemed\npiled up pell-mell, with as much order and harmony as a heap of oyster\nshells. There were a few tallow dips lighted on the tables; but the real\nluminary of this tavern, that which played the part in this dram-shop of\nthe chandelier of an opera house, was the fire. This cellar was so damp\nthat the fire was never allowed to go out, even in midsummer; an immense\nchimney with a sculptured mantel, all bristling with heavy iron andirons\nand cooking utensils, with one of those huge fires of mixed wood and\npeat which at night, in village streets make the reflection of forge\nwindows stand out so red on the opposite walls. A big dog gravely seated\nin the ashes was turning a spit loaded with meat before the coals.\n\nGreat as was the confusion, after the first glance one could distinguish\nin that multitude, three principal groups which thronged around three\npersonages already known to the reader. One of these personages,\nfantastically accoutred in many an oriental rag, was Mathias Hungadi\nSpicali, Duke of Egypt and Bohemia. The knave was seated on a table with\nhis legs crossed, and in a loud voice was bestowing his knowledge of\nmagic, both black and white, on many a gaping face which surrounded him.\nAnother rabble pressed close around our old friend, the valiant King of\nThunes, armed to the teeth. Clopin Trouillefou, with a very serious air\nand in a low voice, was regulating the distribution of an enormous cask\nof arms, which stood wide open in front of him and from whence poured\nout in profusion, axes, swords, bassinets, coats of mail, broadswords,\nlance-heads, arrows, and viretons,* like apples and grapes from a horn\nof plenty. Every one took something from the cask, one a morion, another\na long, straight sword, another a dagger with a cross--shaped hilt. The\nvery children were arming themselves, and there were even cripples in\nbowls who, in armor and cuirass, made their way between the legs of the\ndrinkers, like great beetles.\n\n\n     *  An arrow with a pyramidal head of iron and copper spiral\nwings, by which a rotatory motion was communicated.\n\n\nFinally, a third audience, the most noisy, the most jovial, and the most\nnumerous, encumbered benches and tables, in the midst of which harangued\nand swore a flute-like voice, which escaped from beneath a heavy armor,\ncomplete from casque to spurs. The individual who had thus screwed a\nwhole outfit upon his body, was so hidden by his warlike accoutrements\nthat nothing was to be seen of his person save an impertinent, red,\nsnub nose, a rosy mouth, and bold eyes. His belt was full of daggers and\nponiards, a huge sword on his hip, a rusted cross-bow at his left, and a\nvast jug of wine in front of him, without reckoning on his right, a fat\nwench with her bosom uncovered. All mouths around him were laughing,\ncursing, and drinking.\n\nAdd twenty secondary groups, the waiters, male and female, running with\njugs on their heads, gamblers squatting over taws, merelles,* dice,\nvachettes, the ardent game of tringlet, quarrels in one corner, kisses\nin another, and the reader will have some idea of this whole picture,\nover which flickered the light of a great, flaming fire, which made a\nthousand huge and grotesque shadows dance over the walls of the drinking\nshop.\n\n\n     *  A game played on a checker-board containing three concentric\nsets of squares, with small stones. The game consisted in getting three\nstones in a row.\n\n\nAs for the noise, it was like the inside of a bell at full peal.\n\nThe dripping-pan, where crackled a rain of grease, filled with its\ncontinual sputtering the intervals of these thousand dialogues, which\nintermingled from one end of the apartment to the other.\n\nIn the midst of this uproar, at the extremity of the tavern, on the\nbench inside the chimney, sat a philosopher meditating with his feet in\nthe ashes and his eyes on the brands. It was Pierre Gringoire.\n\n\"Be quick! make haste, arm yourselves! we set out on the march in an\nhour!\" said Clopin Trouillefou to his thieves.\n\nA wench was humming,--\n\n         \"_Bonsoir mon p\u00c3\u00a8re et ma mere,\n         Les derniers couvrent le feu_.\"*\n\n\n     * Good night, father and mother, the last cover up the fire.\n\n\nTwo card players were disputing,--\n\n\"Knave!\" cried the reddest faced of the two, shaking his fist at the\nother; \"I'll mark you with the club. You can take the place of Mistigri\nin the pack of cards of monseigneur the king.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" roared a Norman, recognizable by his nasal accent; \"we are packed\nin here like the saints of Caillouville!\"\n\n\"My sons,\" the Duke of Egypt was saying to his audience, in a falsetto\nvoice, \"sorceresses in France go to the witches' sabbath without\nbroomsticks, or grease, or steed, merely by means of some magic words.\nThe witches of Italy always have a buck waiting for them at their door.\nAll are bound to go out through the chimney.\"\n\nThe voice of the young scamp armed from head to foot, dominated the\nuproar.\n\n\"Hurrah! hurrah!\" he was shouting. \"My first day in armor! Outcast! I\nam an outcast. Give me something to drink. My friends, my name is Jehan\nFrollo du Moulin, and I am a gentleman. My opinion is that if God were a\n_gendarme_, he would turn robber. Brothers, we are about to set out on\na fine expedition. Lay siege to the church, burst in the doors, drag out\nthe beautiful girl, save her from the judges, save her from the priests,\ndismantle the cloister, burn the bishop in his palace--all this we will\ndo in less time than it takes for a burgomaster to eat a spoonful of\nsoup. Our cause is just, we will plunder Notre-Dame and that will be the\nend of it. We will hang Quasimodo. Do you know Quasimodo, ladies?\nHave you seen him make himself breathless on the big bell on a grand\nPentecost festival! _Corne du P\u00c3\u00a8re_! 'tis very fine! One would say he\nwas a devil mounted on a man. Listen to me, my friends; I am a vagabond\nto the bottom of my heart, I am a member of the slang thief gang in\nmy soul, I was born an independent thief. I have been rich, and I have\ndevoured all my property. My mother wanted to make an officer of me; my\nfather, a sub-deacon; my aunt, a councillor of inquests; my grandmother,\nprothonotary to the king; my great aunt, a treasurer of the short\nrobe,--and I have made myself an outcast. I said this to my father,\nwho spit his curse in my face; to my mother, who set to weeping and\nchattering, poor old lady, like yonder fagot on the and-irons. Long live\nmirth! I am a real Bic\u00c3\u00aatre. Waitress, my dear, more wine. I have still\nthe wherewithal to pay. I want no more Sur\u00c3\u00a8ne wine. It distresses my\nthroat. I'd as lief, _corboeuf_! gargle my throat with a basket.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the rabble applauded with shouts of laughter; and seeing that\nthe tumult was increasing around him, the scholar cried,--.\n\n\"Oh! what a fine noise! _Populi debacchantis populosa debacchatio_!\"\nThen he began to sing, his eye swimming in ecstasy, in the tone of a\ncanon intoning vespers, _qu\u00c3\u00a6 cantica! qu\u00c3\u00a6 organa! qu\u00c3\u00a6 cantilenoe!\nqu\u00c3\u00a6 meloclioe hic sine fine decantantur! Sonant melliflua hymnorum\norgana, suavissima angelorum melodia, cantica canticorum mira_! He broke\noff: \"Tavern-keeper of the devil, give me some supper!\"\n\nThere was a moment of partial silence, during which the sharp voice of\nthe Duke of Egypt rose, as he gave instructions to his Bohemians.\n\n\"The weasel is called Adrune; the fox, Blue-foot, or the Racer of the\nWoods; the wolf, Gray-foot, or Gold-foot; the bear the Old Man, or\nGrandfather. The cap of a gnome confers invisibility, and causes one to\nbehold invisible things. Every toad that is baptized must be clad in red\nor black velvet, a bell on its neck, a bell on its feet. The godfather\nholds its head, the godmother its hinder parts. 'Tis the demon\nSidragasum who hath the power to make wenches dance stark naked.\"\n\n\"By the mass!\" interrupted Jehan, \"I should like to be the demon\nSidragasum.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the vagabonds continued to arm themselves and whisper at the\nother end of the dram-shop.\n\n\"That poor Esmeralda!\" said a Bohemian. \"She is our sister. She must be\ntaken away from there.\"\n\n\"Is she still at Notre-Dame?\" went on a merchant with the appearance of\na Jew.\n\n\"Yes, pardieu!\"\n\n\"Well! comrades!\" exclaimed the merchant, \"to Notre-Dame! So much the\nbetter, since there are in the chapel of Saints F\u00c3\u00a9r\u00c3\u00a9ol and Ferrution\ntwo statues, the one of John the Baptist, the other of Saint-Antoine, of\nsolid gold, weighing together seven marks of gold and fifteen estellins;\nand the pedestals are of silver-gilt, of seventeen marks, five ounces. I\nknow that; I am a goldsmith.\"\n\nHere they served Jehan with his supper. As he threw himself back on the\nbosom of the wench beside him, he exclaimed,--\n\n\"By Saint Voult-de-Lucques, whom people call Saint Goguelu, I am\nperfectly happy. I have before me a fool who gazes at me with the smooth\nface of an archduke. Here is one on my left whose teeth are so long that\nthey hide his chin. And then, I am like the Marshal de Gi\u00c3\u00a9 at the siege\nof Pontoise, I have my right resting on a hillock. _Ventre-Mahom_!\nComrade! you have the air of a merchant of tennis-balls; and you come\nand sit yourself beside me! I am a nobleman, my friend! Trade is\nincompatible with nobility. Get out of that! Hola h\u00c3\u00a9! You others, don't\nfight! What, Baptiste Croque-Oison, you who have such a fine nose are\ngoing to risk it against the big fists of that lout! Fool! _Non cuiquam\ndatum est habere nasum_--not every one is favored with a nose. You are\nreally divine, Jacqueline Ronge-Oreille! 'tis a pity that you have no\nhair! Hol\u00c3\u00a0! my name is Jehan Frollo, and my brother is an archdeacon.\nMay the devil fly off with him! All that I tell you is the truth. In\nturning vagabond, I have gladly renounced the half of a house situated\nin paradise, which my brother had promised me. _Dimidiam domum in\nparadiso_. I quote the text. I have a fief in the Rue Tirechappe, and\nall the women are in love with me, as true as Saint Eloy was an\nexcellent goldsmith, and that the five trades of the good city of\nParis are the tanners, the tawers, the makers of cross-belts, the\npurse-makers, and the sweaters, and that Saint Laurent was burnt\nwith eggshells. I swear to you, comrades.\n\n\n         \"_Que je ne beuvrai de piment,\n         Devant un an, si je cy ment_.*\n\n\n     *  That I will drink no spiced and honeyed wine for a year,\nif I am lying now.\n\n\n\"'Tis moonlight, my charmer; see yonder through the window how the\nwind is tearing the clouds to tatters! Even thus will I do to\nyour gorget.--Wenches, wipe the children's noses and snuff the\ncandles.--Christ and Mahom! What am I eating here, Jupiter? Oh\u00c3\u00a9!\ninnkeeper! the hair which is not on the heads of your hussies one finds\nin your omelettes. Old woman! I like bald omelettes. May the devil\nconfound you!--A fine hostelry of Beelzebub, where the hussies comb\ntheir heads with the forks!\n\n\n         \"Et je n'ai moi,\n         Par la sang-Dieu!\n         Ni foi, ni loi,\n         Ni feu, ni lieu,\n         Ni roi,\n         Ni Dieu.\"*\n\n\n     *  And by the blood of God, I have neither faith nor law, nor\n     fire nor dwelling-place, nor king nor God.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Clopin Trouillefou had finished the distribution of\narms. He approached Gringoire, who appeared to be plunged in a profound\nrevery, with his feet on an andiron.\n\n\"Friend Pierre,\" said the King of Thunes, \"what the devil are you\nthinking about?\"\n\nGringoire turned to him with a melancholy smile.\n\n\"I love the fire, my dear lord. Not for the trivial reason that fire\nwarms the feet or cooks our soup, but because it has sparks. Sometimes I\npass whole hours in watching the sparks. I discover a thousand things in\nthose stars which are sprinkled over the black background of the hearth.\nThose stars are also worlds.\"\n\n\"Thunder, if I understand you!\" said the outcast. \"Do you know what\no'clock it is?\"\n\n\"I do not know,\" replied Gringoire.\n\nClopin approached the Duke of Egypt.\n\n\"Comrade Mathias, the time we have chosen is not a good one. King Louis\nXI. is said to be in Paris.\"\n\n\"Another reason for snatching our sister from his claws,\" replied the\nold Bohemian.\n\n\"You speak like a man, Mathias,\" said the King of Thunes. \"Moreover,\nwe will act promptly. No resistance is to be feared in the church. The\ncanons are hares, and we are in force. The people of the parliament will\nbe well balked to-morrow when they come to seek her! Guts of the pope I\ndon't want them to hang the pretty girl!\"\n\nChopin quitted the dram-shop.\n\nMeanwhile, Jehan was shouting in a hoarse voice:\n\n\"I eat, I drink, I am drunk, I am Jupiter! Eh! Pierre, the Slaughterer,\nif you look at me like that again, I'll fillip the dust off your nose\nfor you.\"\n\nGringoire, torn from his meditations, began to watch the wild and noisy\nscene which surrounded him, muttering between his teeth: \"_Luxuriosa\nres vinum et tumultuosa ebrietas_. Alas! what good reason I have not to\ndrink, and how excellently spoke Saint-Benoit: '_Vinum apostatare facit\netiam sapientes!_'\"\n\nAt that moment, Clopin returned and shouted in a voice of thunder:\n\"Midnight!\"\n\nAt this word, which produced the effect of the call to boot and saddle\non a regiment at a halt, all the outcasts, men, women, children,\nrushed in a mass from the tavern, with great noise of arms and old iron\nimplements.\n\nThe moon was obscured.\n\nThe Cour des Miracles was entirely dark. There was not a single light.\nOne could make out there a throng of men and women conversing in low\ntones. They could be heard buzzing, and a gleam of all sorts of weapons\nwas visible in the darkness. Clopin mounted a large stone.\n\n\"To your ranks, Argot!\"* he cried. \"Fall into line, Egypt! Form ranks,\nGalilee!\"\n\n\n     *  Men of the brotherhood of slang: thieves.\n\n\nA movement began in the darkness. The immense multitude appeared to form\nin a column. After a few minutes, the King of Thunes raised his voice\nonce more,--\n\n\"Now, silence to march through Paris! The password is, 'Little sword\nin pocket!' The torches will not be lighted till we reach Notre-Dame!\nForward, march!\"\n\nTen minutes later, the cavaliers of the watch fled in terror before a\nlong procession of black and silent men which was descending towards\nthe Pont an Change, through the tortuous streets which pierce the\nclose-built neighborhood of the markets in every direction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. AN AWKWARD FRIEND.\n\n\n\nThat night, Quasimodo did not sleep. He had just made his last round of\nthe church. He had not noticed, that at the moment when he was closing\nthe doors, the archdeacon had passed close to him and betrayed some\ndispleasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous\niron locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall. Dom\nClaude's air was even more preoccupied than usual. Moreover, since the\nnocturnal adventure in the cell, he had constantly abused Quasimodo,\nbut in vain did he ill treat, and even beat him occasionally, nothing\ndisturbed the submission, patience, the devoted resignation of\nthe faithful bellringer. He endured everything on the part of the\narchdeacon, insults, threats, blows, without murmuring a complaint. At\nthe most, he gazed uneasily after Dom Claude when the latter ascended\nthe staircase of the tower; but the archdeacon had abstained from\npresenting himself again before the gypsy's eyes.\n\nOn that night, accordingly, Quasimodo, after having cast a glance at his\npoor bells which he so neglected now, Jacqueline, Marie, and Thibauld,\nmounted to the summit of the Northern tower, and there setting his dark\nlanturn, well closed, upon the leads, he began to gaze at Paris. The\nnight, as we have already said, was very dark. Paris which, so to\nspeak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused\ncollection of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of\nthe Seine. Quasimodo no longer saw any light with the exception of one\nwindow in a distant edifice, whose vague and sombre profile was outlined\nwell above the roofs, in the direction of the Porte Sainte-Antoine.\nThere also, there was some one awake.\n\nAs the only eye of the bellringer peered into that horizon of mist and\nnight, he felt within him an inexpressible uneasiness. For several days\nhe had been upon his guard. He had perceived men of sinister mien, who\nnever took their eyes from the young girl's asylum, prowling constantly\nabout the church. He fancied that some plot might be in process of\nformation against the unhappy refugee. He imagined that there existed\na popular hatred against her, as against himself, and that it was very\npossible that something might happen soon. Hence he remained upon his\ntower on the watch, \"dreaming in his dream-place,\" as Rabelais says,\nwith his eye directed alternately on the cell and on Paris, keeping\nfaithful guard, like a good dog, with a thousand suspicions in his mind.\n\nAll at once, while he was scrutinizing the great city with that eye\nwhich nature, by a sort of compensation, had made so piercing that it\ncould almost supply the other organs which Quasimodo lacked, it\nseemed to him that there was something singular about the Quay de la\nVieille-Pelleterie, that there was a movement at that point, that the\nline of the parapet, standing out blackly against the whiteness of the\nwater was not straight and tranquil, like that of the other quays, but\nthat it undulated to the eye, like the waves of a river, or like the\nheads of a crowd in motion.\n\nThis struck him as strange. He redoubled his attention. The movement\nseemed to be advancing towards the City. There was no light. It lasted\nfor some time on the quay; then it gradually ceased, as though that\nwhich was passing were entering the interior of the island; then\nit stopped altogether, and the line of the quay became straight and\nmotionless again.\n\nAt the moment when Quasimodo was lost in conjectures, it seemed to\nhim that the movement had re-appeared in the Rue du Parvis, which is\nprolonged into the city perpendicularly to the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of Notre-Dame.\nAt length, dense as was the darkness, he beheld the head of a column\ndebouch from that street, and in an instant a crowd--of which nothing\ncould be distinguished in the gloom except that it was a crowd--spread\nover the Place.\n\nThis spectacle had a terror of its own. It is probable that this\nsingular procession, which seemed so desirous of concealing itself under\nprofound darkness, maintained a silence no less profound. Nevertheless,\nsome noise must have escaped it, were it only a trampling. But this\nnoise did not even reach our deaf man, and this great multitude, of\nwhich he saw hardly anything, and of which he heard nothing, though it\nwas marching and moving so near him, produced upon him the effect of a\nrabble of dead men, mute, impalpable, lost in a smoke. It seemed to\nhim, that he beheld advancing towards him a fog of men, and that he saw\nshadows moving in the shadow.\n\nThen his fears returned to him, the idea of an attempt against the gypsy\npresented itself once more to his mind. He was conscious, in a confused\nway, that a violent crisis was approaching. At that critical moment he\ntook counsel with himself, with better and prompter reasoning than one\nwould have expected from so badly organized a brain. Ought he to awaken\nthe gypsy? to make her escape? Whither? The streets were invested, the\nchurch backed on the river. No boat, no issue!--There was but one\nthing to be done; to allow himself to be killed on the threshold of\nNotre-Dame, to resist at least until succor arrived, if it should\narrive, and not to trouble la Esmeralda's sleep. This resolution once\ntaken, he set to examining the enemy with more tranquillity.\n\nThe throng seemed to increase every moment in the church square. Only,\nhe presumed that it must be making very little noise, since the windows\non the Place remained closed. All at once, a flame flashed up, and in\nan instant seven or eight lighted torches passed over the heads of the\ncrowd, shaking their tufts of flame in the deep shade. Quasimodo then\nbeheld distinctly surging in the Parvis a frightful herd of men and\nwomen in rags, armed with scythes, pikes, billhooks and partisans, whose\nthousand points glittered. Here and there black pitchforks formed horns\nto the hideous faces. He vaguely recalled this populace, and thought\nthat he recognized all the heads who had saluted him as Pope of the\nFools some months previously. One man who held a torch in one hand and\na club in the other, mounted a stone post and seemed to be haranguing\nthem. At the same time the strange army executed several evolutions, as\nthough it were taking up its post around the church. Quasimodo picked up\nhis lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order\nto get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.\n\nClopin Trouillefou, on arriving in front of the lofty portal of\nNotre-Dame had, in fact, ranged his troops in order of battle. Although\nhe expected no resistance, he wished, like a prudent general, to\npreserve an order which would permit him to face, at need, a sudden\nattack of the watch or the police. He had accordingly stationed his\nbrigade in such a manner that, viewed from above and from a distance,\none would have pronounced it the Roman triangle of the battle of\nEcnomus, the boar's head of Alexander or the famous wedge of Gustavus\nAdolphus. The base of this triangle rested on the back of the Place in\nsuch a manner as to bar the entrance of the Rue du Parvis; one of its\nsides faced H\u00c3\u00b4tel-Dieu, the other the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs.\nClopin Trouillefou had placed himself at the apex with the Duke of\nEgypt, our friend Jehan, and the most daring of the scavengers.\n\nAn enterprise like that which the vagabonds were now undertaking against\nNotre-Dame was not a very rare thing in the cities of the Middle Ages.\nWhat we now call the \"police\" did not exist then. In populous cities,\nespecially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating\npower. Feudalism had constructed these great communities in a singular\nmanner. A city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries, which\ndivided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes. Hence, a thousand\nconflicting establishments of police; that is to say, no police at all.\nIn Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords\nwho laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to\na manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had\nfive hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre-Dame des Champs, who had\nfour. All these feudal justices recognized the suzerain authority of the\nking only in name. All possessed the right of control over the roads.\nAll were at home. Louis XI., that indefatigable worker, who so largely\nbegan the demolition of the feudal edifice, continued by Richelieu and\nLouis XIV. for the profit of royalty, and finished by Mirabeau for the\nbenefit of the people,--Louis XI. had certainly made an effort to break\nthis network of seignories which covered Paris, by throwing violently\nacross them all two or three troops of general police. Thus, in 1465, an\norder to the inhabitants to light candles in their windows at nightfall,\nand to shut up their dogs under penalty of death; in the same year,\nan order to close the streets in the evening with iron chains, and a\nprohibition to wear daggers or weapons of offence in the streets\nat night. But in a very short time, all these efforts at communal\nlegislation fell into abeyance. The bourgeois permitted the wind to\nblow out their candles in the windows, and their dogs to stray; the iron\nchains were stretched only in a state of siege; the prohibition to\nwear daggers wrought no other changes than from the name of the Rue\nCoupe-Gueule to the name of the Rue-Coupe-Gorge* which is an evident\nprogress. The old scaffolding of feudal jurisdictions remained standing;\nan immense aggregation of bailiwicks and seignories crossing each\nother all over the city, interfering with each other, entangled in one\nanother, enmeshing each other, trespassing on each other; a useless\nthicket of watches, sub-watches and counter-watches, over which, with\narmed force, passed brigandage, rapine, and sedition. Hence, in this\ndisorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against\na palace, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were\nnot unheard-of occurrences. In the majority of such cases, the neighbors\ndid not meddle with the matter unless the pillaging extended to\nthemselves. They stopped up their ears to the musket shots, closed their\nshutters, barricaded their doors, allowed the matter to be concluded\nwith or without the watch, and the next day it was said in Paris,\n\"Etienne Barbette was broken open last night. The Marshal de Clermont\nwas seized last night, etc.\" Hence, not only the royal habitations, the\nLouvre, the Palace, the Bastille, the Tournelles, but simply seignorial\nresidences, the Petit-Bourbon, the H\u00c3\u00b4tel de Sens, the H\u00c3\u00b4tel d'\nAngoul\u00c3\u00aame, etc., had battlements on their walls, and machicolations over\ntheir doors. Churches were guarded by their sanctity. Some, among the\nnumber Notre-Dame, were fortified. The Abbey of Saint-German-des-Pres\nwas castellated like a baronial mansion, and more brass expended about\nit in bombards than in bells. Its fortress was still to be seen in 1610.\nTo-day, barely its church remains.\n\n\n     *  Cut-throat.  Coupe-gueule being the vulgar word for cut-weazand.\n\n\nLet us return to Notre-Dame.\n\nWhen the first arrangements were completed, and we must say, to the\nhonor of vagabond discipline, that Clopin's orders were executed in\nsilence, and with admirable precision, the worthy chief of the band,\nmounted on the parapet of the church square, and raised his hoarse and\nsurly voice, turning towards Notre-Dame, and brandishing his torch whose\nlight, tossed by the wind, and veiled every moment by its own smoke,\nmade the reddish fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the church appear and disappear before the\neye.\n\n\"To you, Louis de Beaumont, bishop of Paris, counsellor in the Court of\nParliament, I, Clopin Trouillefou, king of Thunes, grand Co\u00c3\u00absre, prince\nof Argot, bishop of fools, I say: Our sister, falsely condemned for\nmagic, hath taken refuge in your church, you owe her asylum and safety.\nNow the Court of Parliament wishes to seize her once more there, and you\nconsent to it; so that she would be hanged to-morrow in the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, if\nGod and the outcasts were not here. If your church is sacred, so is our\nsister; if our sister is not sacred, neither is your church. That is why\nwe call upon you to return the girl if you wish to save your church, or\nwe will take possession of the girl again and pillage the church, which\nwill be a good thing. In token of which I here plant my banner, and may\nGod preserve you, bishop of Paris.\"\n\nQuasimodo could not, unfortunately, hear these words uttered with a sort\nof sombre and savage majesty. A vagabond presented his banner to Clopin,\nwho planted it solemnly between two paving-stones. It was a pitchfork\nfrom whose points hung a bleeding quarter of carrion meat.\n\nThat done, the King of Thunes turned round and cast his eyes over his\narmy, a fierce multitude whose glances flashed almost equally with their\npikes. After a momentary pause,--\"Forward, my Sons!\" he cried; \"to work,\nlocksmiths!\"\n\nThirty bold men, square shouldered, and with pick-lock faces, stepped\nfrom the ranks, with hammers, pincers, and bars of iron on their\nshoulders. They betook themselves to the principal door of the church,\nascended the steps, and were soon to be seen squatting under the arch,\nworking at the door with pincers and levers; a throng of vagabonds\nfollowed them to help or look on. The eleven steps before the portal\nwere covered with them.\n\nBut the door stood firm. \"The devil! 'tis hard and obstinate!\" said one.\n\"It is old, and its gristles have become bony,\" said another. \"Courage,\ncomrades!\" resumed Clopin. \"I wager my head against a dipper that you\nwill have opened the door, rescued the girl, and despoiled the chief\naltar before a single beadle is awake. Stay! I think I hear the lock\nbreaking up.\"\n\nClopin was interrupted by a frightful uproar which re-sounded behind him\nat that moment. He wheeled round. An enormous beam had just fallen from\nabove; it had crushed a dozen vagabonds on the pavement with the sound\nof a cannon, breaking in addition, legs here and there in the crowd\nof beggars, who sprang aside with cries of terror. In a twinkling, the\nnarrow precincts of the church parvis were cleared. The locksmiths,\nalthough protected by the deep vaults of the portal, abandoned the door\nand Clopin himself retired to a respectful distance from the church.\n\n\"I had a narrow escape!\" cried Jehan. \"I felt the wind, of it,\n_t\u00c3\u00aate-de-boeuf_! but Pierre the Slaughterer is slaughtered!\"\n\nIt is impossible to describe the astonishment mingled with fright which\nfell upon the ruffians in company with this beam.\n\nThey remained for several minutes with their eyes in the air, more\ndismayed by that piece of wood than by the king's twenty thousand\narchers.\n\n\"Satan!\" muttered the Duke of Egypt, \"this smacks of magic!\"\n\n\"'Tis the moon which threw this log at us,\" said Andry the Red.\n\n\"Call the moon the friend of the Virgin, after that!\" went on Francois\nChanteprune.\n\n\"A thousand popes!\" exclaimed Clopin, \"you are all fools!\" But he did\nnot know how to explain the fall of the beam.\n\nMeanwhile, nothing could be distinguished on the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade, to whose summit\nthe light of the torches did not reach. The heavy beam lay in the middle\nof the enclosure, and groans were heard from the poor wretches who had\nreceived its first shock, and who had been almost cut in twain, on the\nangle of the stone steps.\n\nThe King of Thunes, his first amazement passed, finally found an\nexplanation which appeared plausible to his companions.\n\n\"Throat of God! are the canons defending themselves? To the sack, then!\nto the sack!\"\n\n\"To the sack!\" repeated the rabble, with a furious hurrah. A discharge\nof crossbows and hackbuts against the front of the church followed.\n\nAt this detonation, the peaceable inhabitants of the surrounding houses\nwoke up; many windows were seen to open, and nightcaps and hands holding\ncandles appeared at the casements.\n\n\"Fire at the windows,\" shouted Clopin. The windows were immediately\nclosed, and the poor bourgeois, who had hardly had time to cast\na frightened glance on this scene of gleams and tumult, returned,\nperspiring with fear to their wives, asking themselves whether the\nwitches' sabbath was now being held in the parvis of Notre-Dame,\nor whether there was an assault of Burgundians, as in '64. Then the\nhusbands thought of theft; the wives, of rape; and all trembled.\n\n\"To the sack!\" repeated the thieves' crew; but they dared not approach.\nThey stared at the beam, they stared at the church. The beam did not\nstir, the edifice preserved its calm and deserted air; but something\nchilled the outcasts.\n\n\"To work, locksmiths!\" shouted Trouillefou. \"Let the door be forced!\"\n\nNo one took a step.\n\n\"Beard and belly!\" said Clopin, \"here be men afraid of a beam.\"\n\nAn old locksmith addressed him--\n\n\"Captain, 'tis not the beam which bothers us, 'tis the door, which is\nall covered with iron bars. Our pincers are powerless against it.\"\n\n\"What more do you want to break it in?\" demanded Clopin.\n\n\"Ah! we ought to have a battering ram.\"\n\nThe King of Thunes ran boldly to the formidable beam, and placed his\nfoot upon it: \"Here is one!\" he exclaimed; \"'tis the canons who send it\nto you.\" And, making a mocking salute in the direction of the church,\n\"Thanks, canons!\"\n\nThis piece of bravado produced its effects,--the spell of the beam was\nbroken. The vagabonds recovered their courage; soon the heavy joist,\nraised like a feather by two hundred vigorous arms, was flung with fury\nagainst the great door which they had tried to batter down. At the sight\nof that long beam, in the half-light which the infrequent torches of\nthe brigands spread over the Place, thus borne by that crowd of men who\ndashed it at a run against the church, one would have thought that he\nbeheld a monstrous beast with a thousand feet attacking with lowered\nhead the giant of stone.\n\nAt the shock of the beam, the half metallic door sounded like an immense\ndrum; it was not burst in, but the whole cathedral trembled, and the\ndeepest cavities of the edifice were heard to echo.\n\nAt the same moment, a shower of large stones began to fall from the top\nof the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade on the assailants.\n\n\"The devil!\" cried Jehan, \"are the towers shaking their balustrades down\non our heads?\"\n\nBut the impulse had been given, the King of Thunes had set the example.\nEvidently, the bishop was defending himself, and they only battered the\ndoor with the more rage, in spite of the stones which cracked skulls\nright and left.\n\nIt was remarkable that all these stones fell one by one; but they\nfollowed each other closely. The thieves always felt two at a time, one\non their legs and one on their heads. There were few which did not\ndeal their blow, and a large layer of dead and wounded lay bleeding\nand panting beneath the feet of the assailants who, now grown furious,\nreplaced each other without intermission. The long beam continued to\nbelabor the door, at regular intervals, like the clapper of a bell, the\nstones to rain down, the door to groan.\n\nThe reader has no doubt divined that this unexpected resistance which\nhad exasperated the outcasts came from Quasimodo.\n\nChance had, unfortunately, favored the brave deaf man.\n\nWhen he had descended to the platform between the towers, his ideas were\nall in confusion. He had run up and down along the gallery for several\nminutes like a madman, surveying from above, the compact mass of\nvagabonds ready to hurl itself on the church, demanding the safety of\nthe gypsy from the devil or from God. The thought had occurred to him of\nascending to the southern belfry and sounding the alarm, but before\nhe could have set the bell in motion, before Marie's voice could have\nuttered a single clamor, was there not time to burst in the door of the\nchurch ten times over? It was precisely the moment when the locksmiths\nwere advancing upon it with their tools. What was to be done?\n\nAll at once, he remembered that some masons had been at work all day\nrepairing the wall, the timber-work, and the roof of the south tower.\nThis was a flash of light. The wall was of stone, the roof of lead, the\ntimber-work of wood. (That prodigious timber-work, so dense that it was\ncalled \"the forest.\")\n\nQuasimodo hastened to that tower. The lower chambers were, in fact, full\nof materials. There were piles of rough blocks of stone, sheets of lead\nin rolls, bundles of laths, heavy beams already notched with the saw,\nheaps of plaster.\n\nTime was pressing, The pikes and hammers were at work below. With a\nstrength which the sense of danger increased tenfold, he seized one\nof the beams--the longest and heaviest; he pushed it out through a\nloophole, then, grasping it again outside of the tower, he made it slide\nalong the angle of the balustrade which surrounds the platform, and\nlet it fly into the abyss. The enormous timber, during that fall of a\nhundred and sixty feet, scraping the wall, breaking the carvings, turned\nmany times on its centre, like the arm of a windmill flying off alone\nthrough space. At last it reached the ground, the horrible cry arose,\nand the black beam, as it rebounded from the pavement, resembled a\nserpent leaping.\n\nQuasimodo beheld the outcasts scatter at the fall of the beam, like\nashes at the breath of a child. He took advantage of their fright, and\nwhile they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had\nfallen from heaven, and while they were putting out the eyes of the\nstone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and buckshot,\nQuasimodo was silently piling up plaster, stones, and rough blocks of\nstone, even the sacks of tools belonging to the masons, on the edge of\nthe balustrade from which the beam had already been hurled.\n\nThus, as soon as they began to batter the grand door, the shower of\nrough blocks of stone began to fall, and it seemed to them that the\nchurch itself was being demolished over their heads.\n\nAny one who could have beheld Quasimodo at that moment would have been\nfrightened. Independently of the projectiles which he had piled upon the\nbalustrade, he had collected a heap of stones on the platform itself. As\nfast as the blocks on the exterior edge were exhausted, he drew on the\nheap. Then he stooped and rose, stooped and rose again with incredible\nactivity. His huge gnome's head bent over the balustrade, then an\nenormous stone fell, then another, then another. From time to time, he\nfollowed a fine stone with his eye, and when it did good execution, he\nsaid, \"Hum!\"\n\nMeanwhile, the beggars did not grow discouraged. The thick door on which\nthey were venting their fury had already trembled more than twenty\ntimes beneath the weight of their oaken battering-ram, multiplied by the\nstrength of a hundred men. The panels cracked, the carved work flew into\nsplinters, the hinges, at every blow, leaped from their pins, the planks\nyawned, the wood crumbled to powder, ground between the iron sheathing.\nFortunately for Quasimodo, there was more iron than wood.\n\nNevertheless, he felt that the great door was yielding. Although he did\nnot hear it, every blow of the ram reverberated simultaneously in the\nvaults of the church and within it. From above he beheld the vagabonds,\nfilled with triumph and rage, shaking their fists at the gloomy fa\u00c3\u00a7ade;\nand both on the gypsy's account and his own he envied the wings of the\nowls which flitted away above his head in flocks.\n\nHis shower of stone blocks was not sufficient to repel the assailants.\n\nAt this moment of anguish, he noticed, a little lower down than the\nbalustrade whence he was crushing the thieves, two long stone gutters\nwhich discharged immediately over the great door; the internal orifice\nof these gutters terminated on the pavement of the platform. An idea\noccurred to him; he ran in search of a fagot in his bellringer's den,\nplaced on this fagot a great many bundles of laths, and many rolls of\nlead, munitions which he had not employed so far, and having arranged\nthis pile in front of the hole to the two gutters, he set it on fire\nwith his lantern.\n\nDuring this time, since the stones no longer fell, the outcasts ceased\nto gaze into the air. The bandits, panting like a pack of hounds who are\nforcing a boar into his lair, pressed tumultuously round the great\ndoor, all disfigured by the battering ram, but still standing. They were\nwaiting with a quiver for the great blow which should split it open.\nThey vied with each other in pressing as close as possible, in order to\ndash among the first, when it should open, into that opulent cathedral,\na vast reservoir where the wealth of three centuries had been piled up.\nThey reminded each other with roars of exultation and greedy lust, of\nthe beautiful silver crosses, the fine copes of brocade, the beautiful\ntombs of silver gilt, the great magnificences of the choir, the\ndazzling festivals, the Christmasses sparkling with torches, the\nEasters sparkling with sunshine,--all those splendid solemneties wherein\nchandeliers, ciboriums, tabernacles, and reliquaries, studded the altars\nwith a crust of gold and diamonds. Certainly, at that fine moment,\nthieves and pseudo sufferers, doctors in stealing, and vagabonds, were\nthinking much less of delivering the gypsy than of pillaging Notre-Dame.\nWe could even easily believe that for a goodly number among them la\nEsmeralda was only a pretext, if thieves needed pretexts.\n\nAll at once, at the moment when they were grouping themselves round the\nram for a last effort, each one holding his breath and stiffening his\nmuscles in order to communicate all his force to the decisive blow, a\nhowl more frightful still than that which had burst forth and expired\nbeneath the beam, rose among them. Those who did not cry out, those who\nwere still alive, looked. Two streams of melted lead were falling from\nthe summit of the edifice into the thickest of the rabble. That sea of\nmen had just sunk down beneath the boiling metal, which had made, at the\ntwo points where it fell, two black and smoking holes in the crowd, such\nas hot water would make in snow. Dying men, half consumed and groaning\nwith anguish, could be seen writhing there. Around these two principal\nstreams there were drops of that horrible rain, which scattered over the\nassailants and entered their skulls like gimlets of fire. It was a heavy\nfire which overwhelmed these wretches with a thousand hailstones.\n\nThe outcry was heartrending. They fled pell-mell, hurling the beam upon\nthe bodies, the boldest as well as the most timid, and the parvis was\ncleared a second time.\n\nAll eyes were raised to the top of the church. They beheld there an\nextraordinary sight. On the crest of the highest gallery, higher than\nthe central rose window, there was a great flame rising between the two\ntowers with whirlwinds of sparks, a vast, disordered, and furious flame,\na tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind, from time to\ntime. Below that fire, below the gloomy balustrade with its trefoils\nshowing darkly against its glare, two spouts with monster throats were\nvomiting forth unceasingly that burning rain, whose silvery stream stood\nout against the shadows of the lower fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. As they approached the\nearth, these two jets of liquid lead spread out in sheaves, like water\nspringing from the thousand holes of a watering-pot. Above the flame,\nthe enormous towers, two sides of each of which were visible in sharp\noutline, the one wholly black, the other wholly red, seemed still more\nvast with all the immensity of the shadow which they cast even to the\nsky.\n\nTheir innumerable sculptures of demons and dragons assumed a lugubrious\naspect. The restless light of the flame made them move to the eye. There\nwere griffins which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied\none heard yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques*\nwhich sneezed in the smoke. And among the monsters thus roused from\ntheir sleep of stone by this flame, by this noise, there was one who\nwalked about, and who was seen, from time to time, to pass across the\nglowing face of the pile, like a bat in front of a candle.\n\n\n     *  The representation of a monstrous animal solemnly drawn about\nin Tarascon and other French towns.\n\n\nWithout doubt, this strange beacon light would awaken far away, the\nwoodcutter of the hills of Bic\u00c3\u00aatre, terrified to behold the gigantic\nshadow of the towers of Notre-Dame quivering over his heaths.\n\nA terrified silence ensued among the outcasts, during which nothing was\nheard, but the cries of alarm of the canons shut up in their cloister,\nand more uneasy than horses in a burning stable, the furtive sound\nof windows hastily opened and still more hastily closed, the internal\nhurly-burly of the houses and of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-Dieu, the wind in the flame,\nthe last death-rattle of the dying, and the continued crackling of the\nrain of lead upon the pavement.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the principal vagabonds had retired beneath the porch\nof the Gondelaurier mansion, and were holding a council of war.\n\nThe Duke of Egypt, seated on a stone post, contemplated the\nphantasmagorical bonfire, glowing at a height of two hundred feet in the\nair, with religious terror. Clopin Trouillefou bit his huge fists with\nrage.\n\n\"Impossible to get in!\" he muttered between his teeth.\n\n\"An old, enchanted church!\" grumbled the aged Bohemian, Mathias Hungadi\nSpicali.\n\n\"By the Pope's whiskers!\" went on a sham soldier, who had once been in\nservice, \"here are church gutters spitting melted lead at you better\nthan the machicolations of Lectoure.\"\n\n\"Do you see that demon passing and repassing in front of the fire?\"\nexclaimed the Duke of Egypt.\n\n\"Pardieu, 'tis that damned bellringer, 'tis Quasimodo,\" said Clopin.\n\nThe Bohemian tossed his head. \"I tell you, that 'tis the spirit Sabnac,\nthe grand marquis, the demon of fortifications. He has the form of an\narmed soldier, the head of a lion. Sometimes he rides a hideous horse.\nHe changes men into stones, of which he builds towers. He commands\nfifty legions 'Tis he indeed; I recognize him. Sometimes he is clad in a\nhandsome golden robe, figured after the Turkish fashion.\"\n\n\"Where is Bellevigne de l'Etoile?\" demanded Clopin.\n\n\"He is dead.\"\n\nAndry the Red laughed in an idiotic way: \"Notre-Dame is making work for\nthe hospital,\" said he.\n\n\"Is there, then, no way of forcing this door,\" exclaimed the King of\nThunes, stamping his foot.\n\nThe Duke of Egypt pointed sadly to the two streams of boiling lead which\ndid not cease to streak the black facade, like two long distaffs of\nphosphorus.\n\n\"Churches have been known to defend themselves thus all by themselves,\"\nhe remarked with a sigh. \"Saint-Sophia at Constantinople, forty years\nago, hurled to the earth three times in succession, the crescent of\nMahom, by shaking her domes, which are her heads. Guillaume de Paris,\nwho built this one was a magician.\"\n\n\"Must we then retreat in pitiful fashion, like highwaymen?\" said Clopin.\n\"Must we leave our sister here, whom those hooded wolves will hang\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"And the sacristy, where there are wagon-loads of gold!\" added a\nvagabond, whose name, we regret to say, we do not know.\n\n\"Beard of Mahom!\" cried Trouillefou.\n\n\"Let us make another trial,\" resumed the vagabond.\n\nMathias Hungadi shook his head.\n\n\"We shall never get in by the door. We must find the defect in the armor\nof the old fairy; a hole, a false postern, some joint or other.\"\n\n\"Who will go with me?\" said Clopin. \"I shall go at it again. By the way,\nwhere is the little scholar Jehan, who is so encased in iron?\"\n\n\"He is dead, no doubt,\" some one replied; \"we no longer hear his laugh.\"\n\nThe King of Thunes frowned: \"So much the worse. There was a brave heart\nunder that ironmongery. And Master Pierre Gringoire?\"\n\n\"Captain Clopin,\" said Andry the Red, \"he slipped away before we reached\nthe Pont-aux-Changeurs.\"\n\nClopin stamped his foot. \"Gueule-Dieu! 'twas he who pushed us on\nhither, and he has deserted us in the very middle of the job! Cowardly\nchatterer, with a slipper for a helmet!\"\n\n\"Captain Clopin,\" said Andry the Red, who was gazing down Rue du Parvis,\n\"yonder is the little scholar.\"\n\n\"Praised be Pluto!\" said Clopin. \"But what the devil is he dragging\nafter him?\"\n\nIt was, in fact, Jehan, who was running as fast as his heavy outfit of a\nPaladin, and a long ladder which trailed on the pavement, would permit,\nmore breathless than an ant harnessed to a blade of grass twenty times\nlonger than itself.\n\n\"Victory! _Te Deum_!\" cried the scholar. \"Here is the ladder of the\nlongshoremen of Port Saint-Landry.\"\n\nClopin approached him.\n\n\"Child, what do you mean to do, _corne-dieu_! with this ladder?\"\n\n\"I have it,\" replied Jehan, panting. \"I knew where it was under the shed\nof the lieutenant's house. There's a wench there whom I know, who thinks\nme as handsome as Cupido. I made use of her to get the ladder, and I\nhave the ladder, _Pasque-Mahom_! The poor girl came to open the door to\nme in her shift.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Clopin, \"but what are you going to do with that ladder?\"\n\nJehan gazed at him with a malicious, knowing look, and cracked his\nfingers like castanets. At that moment he was sublime. On his head he\nwore one of those overloaded helmets of the fifteenth century, which\nfrightened the enemy with their fanciful crests. His bristled with ten\niron beaks, so that Jehan could have disputed with Nestor's Homeric\nvessel the redoubtable title of _dexeubolos_.\n\n\"What do I mean to do with it, august king of Thunes? Do you see that\nrow of statues which have such idiotic expressions, yonder, above the\nthree portals?\"\n\n\"Yes. Well?\"\n\n\"'Tis the gallery of the kings of France.\"\n\n\"What is that to me?\" said Clopin.\n\n\"Wait! At the end of that gallery there is a door which is never\nfastened otherwise than with a latch, and with this ladder I ascend, and\nI am in the church.\"\n\n\"Child let me be the first to ascend.\"\n\n\"No, comrade, the ladder is mine. Come, you shall be the second.\"\n\n\"May Beelzebub strangle you!\" said surly Clopin, \"I won't be second to\nanybody.\"\n\n\"Then find a ladder, Clopin!\"\n\nJehan set out on a run across the Place, dragging his ladder and\nshouting: \"Follow me, lads!\"\n\nIn an instant the ladder was raised, and propped against the balustrade\nof the lower gallery, above one of the lateral doors. The throng of\nvagabonds, uttering loud acclamations, crowded to its foot to ascend.\nBut Jehan maintained his right, and was the first to set foot on the\nrungs. The passage was tolerably long. The gallery of the kings of\nFrance is to-day about sixty feet above the pavement. The eleven steps\nof the flight before the door, made it still higher. Jehan mounted\nslowly, a good deal incommoded by his heavy armor, holding his crossbow\nin one hand, and clinging to a rung with the other. When he reached\nthe middle of the ladder, he cast a melancholy glance at the poor dead\noutcasts, with which the steps were strewn. \"Alas!\" said he, \"here is a\nheap of bodies worthy of the fifth book of the Iliad!\" Then he continued\nhis ascent. The vagabonds followed him. There was one on every rung.\nAt the sight of this line of cuirassed backs, undulating as they rose\nthrough the gloom, one would have pronounced it a serpent with steel\nscales, which was raising itself erect in front of the church. Jehan who\nformed the head, and who was whistling, completed the illusion.\n\nThe scholar finally reached the balcony of the gallery, and climbed over\nit nimbly, to the applause of the whole vagabond tribe. Thus master of\nthe citadel, he uttered a shout of joy, and suddenly halted, petrified.\nHe had just caught sight of Quasimodo concealed in the dark, with\nflashing eye, behind one of the statues of the kings.\n\nBefore a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the\nformidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering\na word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands,\nraised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant\nladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the\nmidst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman force,\nhurled this cluster of men backward into the Place. There was a moment\nwhen even the most resolute trembled. The ladder, launched backwards,\nremained erect and standing for an instant, and seemed to hesitate, then\nwavered, then suddenly, describing a frightful arc of a circle eighty\nfeet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians,\nmore rapidly than a drawbridge when its chains break. There arose an\nimmense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches\nwere seen, crawling over the heap of dead.\n\nA sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among\nthe besiegers. Quasimodo, impassive, with both elbows propped on the\nbalustrade, looked on. He had the air of an old, bushy-headed king at\nhis window.\n\nAs for Jehan Frollo, he was in a critical position. He found himself in\nthe gallery with the formidable bellringer, alone, separated from his\ncompanions by a vertical wall eighty feet high. While Quasimodo was\ndealing with the ladder, the scholar had run to the postern which he\nbelieved to be open. It was not. The deaf man had closed it behind him\nwhen he entered the gallery. Jehan had then concealed himself behind\na stone king, not daring to breathe, and fixing upon the monstrous\nhunchback a frightened gaze, like the man, who, when courting the wife\nof the guardian of a menagerie, went one evening to a love rendezvous,\nmistook the wall which he was to climb, and suddenly found himself face\nto face with a white bear.\n\nFor the first few moments, the deaf man paid no heed to him; but at last\nhe turned his head, and suddenly straightened up. He had just caught\nsight of the scholar.\n\nJehan prepared himself for a rough shock, but the deaf man remained\nmotionless; only he had turned towards the scholar and was looking at\nhim.\n\n\"Ho ho!\" said Jehan, \"what do you mean by staring at me with that\nsolitary and melancholy eye?\"\n\nAs he spoke thus, the young scamp stealthily adjusted his crossbow.\n\n\"Quasimodo!\" he cried, \"I am going to change your surname: you shall be\ncalled the blind man.\"\n\nThe shot sped. The feathered vireton* whizzed and entered the\nhunchback's left arm. Quasimodo appeared no more moved by it than by a\nscratch to King Pharamond. He laid his hand on the arrow, tore it from\nhis arm, and tranquilly broke it across his big knee; then he let the\ntwo pieces drop on the floor, rather than threw them down. But Jehan\nhad no opportunity to fire a second time. The arrow broken, Quasimodo\nbreathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the\nscholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.\n\n\n     *  An arrow with a pyramidal head of iron and copper spiral wings by\nwhich a rotatory motion was communicated.\n\n\nThen in that gloom, wherein wavered the light of the torches, a terrible\nthing was seen.\n\nQuasimodo had grasped with his left hand the two arms of Jehan, who did\nnot offer any resistance, so thoroughly did he feel that he was lost.\nWith his right hand, the deaf man detached one by one, in silence, with\nsinister slowness, all the pieces of his armor, the sword, the daggers,\nthe helmet, the cuirass, the leg pieces. One would have said that it was\na monkey taking the shell from a nut. Quasimodo flung the scholar's\niron shell at his feet, piece by piece. When the scholar beheld himself\ndisarmed, stripped, weak, and naked in those terrible hands, he made no\nattempt to speak to the deaf man, but began to laugh audaciously in his\nface, and to sing with his intrepid heedlessness of a child of sixteen,\nthe then popular ditty:--\n\n         \"_Elle est bien habill\u00c3\u00a9e,\n         La ville de Cambrai;\n         Marafin l'a pill\u00c3\u00a9e_...\"*\n\n\n     * The city of Cambrai is well dressed.  Marafin plundered it.\n\n\nHe did not finish. Quasimodo was seen on the parapet of the gallery,\nholding the scholar by the feet with one hand and whirling him over\nthe abyss like a sling; then a sound like that of a bony structure in\ncontact with a wall was heard, and something was seen to fall which\nhalted a third of the way down in its fall, on a projection in the\narchitecture. It was a dead body which remained hanging there, bent\ndouble, its loins broken, its skull empty.\n\nA cry of horror rose among the vagabonds.\n\n\"Vengeance!\" shouted Clopin. \"To the sack!\" replied the multitude.\n\"Assault! assault!\"\n\nThere came a tremendous howl, in which were mingled all tongues, all\ndialects, all accents. The death of the poor scholar imparted a furious\nardor to that crowd. It was seized with shame, and the wrath of having\nbeen held so long in check before a church by a hunchback. Rage found\nladders, multiplied the torches, and, at the expiration of a few\nminutes, Quasimodo, in despair, beheld that terrible ant heap mount on\nall sides to the assault of Notre-Dame. Those who had no ladders had\nknotted ropes; those who had no ropes climbed by the projections of\nthe carvings. They hung from each other's rags. There were no means of\nresisting that rising tide of frightful faces; rage made these fierce\ncountenances ruddy; their clayey brows were dripping with sweat; their\neyes darted lightnings; all these grimaces, all these horrors laid siege\nto Quasimodo. One would have said that some other church had despatched\nto the assault of Notre-Dame its gorgons, its dogs, its dr\u00c3\u00a9es, its\ndemons, its most fantastic sculptures. It was like a layer of living\nmonsters on the stone monsters of the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade.\n\nMeanwhile, the Place was studded with a thousand torches. This scene of\nconfusion, till now hid in darkness, was suddenly flooded with light.\nThe parvis was resplendent, and cast a radiance on the sky; the bonfire\nlighted on the lofty platform was still burning, and illuminated the\ncity far away. The enormous silhouette of the two towers, projected afar\non the roofs of Paris, and formed a large notch of black in this light.\nThe city seemed to be aroused. Alarm bells wailed in the distance.\nThe vagabonds howled, panted, swore, climbed; and Quasimodo, powerless\nagainst so many enemies, shuddering for the gypsy, beholding the furious\nfaces approaching ever nearer and nearer to his gallery, entreated\nheaven for a miracle, and wrung his arms in despair.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. THE RETREAT IN WHICH MONSIEUR LOUIS OF FRANCE SAYS HIS\nPRAYERS.\n\n\n\nThe reader has not, perhaps, forgotten that one moment before catching\nsight of the nocturnal band of vagabonds, Quasimodo, as he inspected\nParis from the heights of his bell tower, perceived only one light\nburning, which gleamed like a star from a window on the topmost story\nof a lofty edifice beside the Porte Saint-Antoine. This edifice was the\nBastille. That star was the candle of Louis XI. King Louis XI. had, in\nfact, been two days in Paris. He was to take his departure on the next\nday but one for his citadel of Montilz-les-Tours. He made but seldom and\nbrief appearance in his good city of Paris, since there he did not feel\nabout him enough pitfalls, gibbets, and Scotch archers.\n\nHe had come, that day, to sleep at the Bastille. The great chamber five\ntoises* square, which he had at the Louvre, with its huge chimney-piece\nloaded with twelve great beasts and thirteen great prophets, and his\ngrand bed, eleven feet by twelve, pleased him but little. He felt\nhimself lost amid all this grandeur. This good bourgeois king preferred\nthe Bastille with a tiny chamber and couch. And then, the Bastille was\nstronger than the Louvre.\n\n\n     *  An ancient long measure in France, containing six feet\nand nearly five inches English measure.\n\n\nThis little chamber, which the king reserved for himself in the famous\nstate prison, was also tolerably spacious and occupied the topmost\nstory of a turret rising from the donjon keep. It was circular in form,\ncarpeted with mats of shining straw, ceiled with beams, enriched with\nfleurs-de-lis of gilded metal with interjoists in color; wainscoated\nwith rich woods sown with rosettes of white metal, and with others\npainted a fine, bright green, made of orpiment and fine indigo.\n\nThere was only one window, a long pointed casement, latticed with brass\nwire and bars of iron, further darkened by fine colored panes with the\narms of the king and of the queen, each pane being worth two and twenty\nsols.\n\nThere was but one entrance, a modern door, with a fiat arch, garnished\nwith a piece of tapestry on the inside, and on the outside by one of\nthose porches of Irish wood, frail edifices of cabinet-work curiously\nwrought, numbers of which were still to be seen in old houses a hundred\nand fifty years ago. \"Although they disfigure and embarrass the places,\"\nsays Sauvel in despair, \"our old people are still unwilling to get rid\nof them, and keep them in spite of everybody.\"\n\nIn this chamber, nothing was to be found of what furnishes ordinary\napartments, neither benches, nor trestles, nor forms, nor common\nstools in the form of a chest, nor fine stools sustained by pillars and\ncounter-pillars, at four sols a piece. Only one easy arm-chair, very\nmagnificent, was to be seen; the wood was painted with roses on a red\nground, the seat was of ruby Cordovan leather, ornamented with long\nsilken fringes, and studded with a thousand golden nails. The loneliness\nof this chair made it apparent that only one person had a right to sit\ndown in this apartment. Beside the chair, and quite close to the window,\nthere was a table covered with a cloth with a pattern of birds. On this\ntable stood an inkhorn spotted with ink, some parchments, several pens,\nand a large goblet of chased silver. A little further on was a brazier,\na praying stool in crimson velvet, relieved with small bosses of gold.\nFinally, at the extreme end of the room, a simple bed of scarlet and\nyellow damask, without either tinsel or lace; having only an ordinary\nfringe. This bed, famous for having borne the sleep or the sleeplessness\nof Louis XI., was still to be seen two hundred years ago, at the\nhouse of a councillor of state, where it was seen by old Madame Pilou,\ncelebrated in _Cyrus_ under the name \"Arricidie\" and of \"la Morale\nVivante\".\n\nSuch was the chamber which was called \"the retreat where Monsieur Louis\nde France says his prayers.\"\n\nAt the moment when we have introduced the reader into it, this retreat\nwas very dark. The curfew bell had sounded an hour before; night was\ncome, and there was only one flickering wax candle set on the table to\nlight five persons variously grouped in the chamber.\n\nThe first on which the light fell was a seigneur superbly clad in\nbreeches and jerkin of scarlet striped with silver, and a loose coat\nwith half sleeves of cloth of gold with black figures. This splendid\ncostume, on which the light played, seemed glazed with flame on every\nfold. The man who wore it had his armorial bearings embroidered on his\nbreast in vivid colors; a chevron accompanied by a deer passant. The\nshield was flanked, on the right by an olive branch, on the left by a\ndeer's antlers. This man wore in his girdle a rich dagger whose hilt,\nof silver gilt, was chased in the form of a helmet, and surmounted by a\ncount's coronet. He had a forbidding air, a proud mien, and a head\nheld high. At the first glance one read arrogance on his visage; at the\nsecond, craft.\n\nHe was standing bareheaded, a long roll of parchment in his hand, behind\nthe arm-chair in which was seated, his body ungracefully doubled up, his\nknees crossed, his elbow on the table, a very badly accoutred personage.\nLet the reader imagine in fact, on the rich seat of Cordova leather, two\ncrooked knees, two thin thighs, poorly clad in black worsted tricot, a\nbody enveloped in a cloak of fustian, with fur trimming of which more\nleather than hair was visible; lastly, to crown all, a greasy old hat of\nthe worst sort of black cloth, bordered with a circular string of leaden\nfigures. This, in company with a dirty skull-cap, which hardly allowed a\nhair to escape, was all that distinguished the seated personage. He held\nhis head so bent upon his breast, that nothing was to be seen of his\nface thus thrown into shadow, except the tip of his nose, upon which\nfell a ray of light, and which must have been long. From the thinness of\nhis wrinkled hand, one divined that he was an old man. It was Louis XI.\nAt some distance behind them, two men dressed in garments of Flemish\nstyle were conversing, who were not sufficiently lost in the shadow to\nprevent any one who had been present at the performance of Gringoire's\nmystery from recognizing in them two of the principal Flemish envoys,\nGuillaume Rym, the sagacious pensioner of Ghent, and Jacques Coppenole,\nthe popular hosier. The reader will remember that these men were mixed\nup in the secret politics of Louis XI. Finally, quite at the end of\nthe room, near the door, in the dark, stood, motionless as a statue, a\nvigorous man with thickset limbs, a military harness, with a surcoat\nof armorial bearings, whose square face pierced with staring eyes, slit\nwith an immense mouth, his ears concealed by two large screens of flat\nhair, had something about it both of the dog and the tiger.\n\nAll were uncovered except the king.\n\nThe gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long\nmemorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively. The\ntwo Flemings were whispering together.\n\n\"Cross of God!\" grumbled Coppenole, \"I am tired of standing; is there no\nchair here?\"\n\nRym replied by a negative gesture, accompanied by a discreet smile.\n\n\"Croix-Dieu!\" resumed Coppenole, thoroughly unhappy at being obliged to\nlower his voice thus, \"I should like to sit down on the floor, with my\nlegs crossed, like a hosier, as I do in my shop.\"\n\n\"Take good care that you do not, Master Jacques.\"\n\n\"Ouais! Master Guillaume! can one only remain here on his feet?\"\n\n\"Or on his knees,\" said Rym.\n\nAt that moment the king's voice was uplifted. They held their peace.\n\n\"Fifty sols for the robes of our valets, and twelve livres for the\nmantles of the clerks of our crown! That's it! Pour out gold by the ton!\nAre you mad, Olivier?\"\n\nAs he spoke thus, the old man raised his head. The golden shells of the\ncollar of Saint-Michael could be seen gleaming on his neck. The candle\nfully illuminated his gaunt and morose profile. He tore the papers from\nthe other's hand.\n\n\"You are ruining us!\" he cried, casting his hollow eyes over the scroll.\n\"What is all this? What need have we of so prodigious a household? Two\nchaplains at ten livres a month each, and, a chapel clerk at one hundred\nsols! A valet-de-chambre at ninety livres a year. Four head cooks at\nsix score livres a year each! A spit-cook, an herb-cook, a sauce-cook,\na butler, two sumpter-horse lackeys, at ten livres a month each! Two\nscullions at eight livres! A groom of the stables and his two aids at\nfour and twenty livres a month! A porter, a pastry-cook, a baker, two\ncarters, each sixty livres a year! And the farrier six score livres! And\nthe master of the chamber of our funds, twelve hundred livres! And the\ncomptroller five hundred. And how do I know what else? 'Tis ruinous. The\nwages of our servants are putting France to the pillage! All the ingots\nof the Louvre will melt before such a fire of expenses! We shall have to\nsell our plate! And next year, if God and our Lady (here he raised his\nhat) lend us life, we shall drink our potions from a pewter pot!\"\n\nSo saying, he cast a glance at the silver goblet which gleamed upon the\ntable. He coughed and continued,--\n\n\"Master Olivier, the princes who reign over great lordships, like kings\nand emperors, should not allow sumptuousness in their houses; for\nthe fire spreads thence through the province. Hence, Master Olivier,\nconsider this said once for all. Our expenditure increases every year.\nThe thing displease us. How, _pasque-Dieu_! when in '79 it did not\nexceed six and thirty thousand livres, did it attain in '80, forty-three\nthousand six hundred and nineteen livres? I have the figures in my head.\nIn '81, sixty-six thousand six hundred and eighty livres, and this year,\nby the faith of my body, it will reach eighty thousand livres! Doubled\nin four years! Monstrous!\"\n\nHe paused breathless, then resumed energetically,--\n\n\"I behold around me only people who fatten on my leanness! you suck\ncrowns from me at every pore.\"\n\nAll remained silent. This was one of those fits of wrath which are\nallowed to take their course. He continued,--\n\n\"'Tis like that request in Latin from the gentlemen of France, that\nwe should re-establish what they call the grand charges of the Crown!\nCharges in very deed! Charges which crush! Ah! gentlemen! you say that\nwe are not a king to reign _dapifero nullo, buticulario nullo_! We will\nlet you see, _pasque-Dieu_! whether we are not a king!\"\n\nHere he smiled, in the consciousness of his power; this softened his bad\nhumor, and he turned towards the Flemings,--\n\n\"Do you see, Gossip Guillaume? the grand warden of the keys, the grand\nbutler, the grand chamberlain, the grand seneschal are not worth the\nsmallest valet. Remember this, Gossip Coppenole. They serve no purpose,\nas they stand thus useless round the king; they produce upon me the\neffect of the four Evangelists who surround the face of the big clock of\nthe palace, and which Philippe Brille has just set in order afresh. They\nare gilt, but they do not indicate the hour; and the hands can get on\nwithout them.\"\n\nHe remained in thought for a moment, then added, shaking his aged\nhead,--\n\n\"Ho! ho! by our Lady, I am not Philippe Brille, and I shall not gild the\ngreat vassals anew. Continue, Olivier.\"\n\nThe person whom he designated by this name, took the papers into his\nhands again, and began to read aloud,--\n\n\"To Adam Tenon, clerk of the warden of the seals of the provostship of\nParis; for the silver, making, and engraving of said seals, which have\nbeen made new because the others preceding, by reason of their antiquity\nand their worn condition, could no longer be successfully used, twelve\nlivres parisis.\n\n\"To Guillaume Fr\u00c3\u00a8re, the sum of four livres, four sols parisis, for his\ntrouble and salary, for having nourished and fed the doves in the two\ndove-cots of the H\u00c3\u00b4tel des Tournelles, during the months of January,\nFebruary, and March of this year; and for this he hath given seven\nsextiers of barley.\n\n\"To a gray friar for confessing a criminal, four sols parisis.\"\n\nThe king listened in silence. From time to time he coughed; then he\nraised the goblet to his lips and drank a draught with a grimace.\n\n\"During this year there have been made by the ordinance of justice,\nto the sound of the trumpet, through the squares of Paris, fifty-six\nproclamations. Account to be regulated.\n\n\"For having searched and ransacked in certain places, in Paris as well\nas elsewhere, for money said to be there concealed; but nothing hath\nbeen found: forty-five livres parisis.\"\n\n\"Bury a crown to unearth a sou!\" said the king.\n\n\"For having set in the H\u00c3\u00b4tel des Tournelles six panes of white glass\nin the place where the iron cage is, thirteen sols; for having made\nand delivered by command of the king, on the day of the musters, four\nshields with the escutcheons of the said seigneur, encircled with\ngarlands of roses all about, six livres; for two new sleeves to the\nking's old doublet, twenty sols; for a box of grease to grease the boots\nof the king, fifteen deniers; a stable newly made to lodge the king's\nblack pigs, thirty livres parisis; many partitions, planks, and\ntrap-doors, for the safekeeping of the lions at Saint-Paul, twenty-two\nlivres.\"\n\n\"These be dear beasts,\" said Louis XI. \"It matters not; it is a fine\nmagnificence in a king. There is a great red lion whom I love for his\npleasant ways. Have you seen him, Master Guillaume? Princes must have\nthese terrific animals; for we kings must have lions for our dogs and\ntigers for our cats. The great befits a crown. In the days of the pagans\nof Jupiter, when the people offered the temples a hundred oxen and a\nhundred sheep, the emperors gave a hundred lions and a hundred eagles.\nThis was wild and very fine. The kings of France have always had\nroarings round their throne. Nevertheless, people must do me this\njustice, that I spend still less money on it than they did, and that I\npossess a greater modesty of lions, bears, elephants, and leopards.--Go\non, Master Olivier. We wished to say thus much to our Flemish friends.\"\n\nGuillaume Rym bowed low, while Coppenole, with his surly mien, had the\nair of one of the bears of which his majesty was speaking. The king paid\nno heed. He had just dipped his lips into the goblet, and he spat out\nthe beverage, saying: \"Foh! what a disagreeable potion!\" The man who was\nreading continued:--\n\n\"For feeding a rascally footpad, locked up these six months in the\nlittle cell of the flayer, until it should be determined what to do with\nhim, six livres, four sols.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" interrupted the king; \"feed what ought to be hanged!\n_Pasque-Dieu_! I will give not a sou more for that nourishment. Olivier,\ncome to an understanding about the matter with Monsieur d'Estouteville,\nand prepare me this very evening the wedding of the gallant and the\ngallows. Resume.\"\n\nOlivier made a mark with his thumb against the article of the \"rascally\nfoot soldier,\" and passed on.\n\n\"To Henriet Cousin, master executor of the high works of justice in\nParis, the sum of sixty sols parisis, to him assessed and ordained by\nmonseigneur the provost of Paris, for having bought, by order of the\nsaid sieur the provost, a great broad sword, serving to execute and\ndecapitate persons who are by justice condemned for their demerits,\nand he hath caused the same to be garnished with a sheath and with all\nthings thereto appertaining; and hath likewise caused to be repointed\nand set in order the old sword, which had become broken and notched in\nexecuting justice on Messire Louis de Luxembourg, as will more fully\nappear.\"\n\nThe king interrupted: \"That suffices. I allow the sum with great good\nwill. Those are expenses which I do not begrudge. I have never regretted\nthat money. Continue.\"\n\n\"For having made over a great cage...\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the king, grasping the arms of his chair in both hands, \"I\nknew well that I came hither to this Bastille for some purpose. Hold,\nMaster Olivier; I desire to see that cage myself. You shall read me the\ncost while I am examining it. Messieurs Flemings, come and see this;\n'tis curious.\"\n\nThen he rose, leaned on the arm of his interlocutor, made a sign to\nthe sort of mute who stood before the door to precede him, to the two\nFlemings to follow him, and quitted the room.\n\nThe royal company was recruited, at the door of the retreat, by men of\narms, all loaded down with iron, and by slender pages bearing flambeaux.\nIt marched for some time through the interior of the gloomy donjon,\npierced with staircases and corridors even in the very thickness of the\nwalls. The captain of the Bastille marched at their head, and caused the\nwickets to be opened before the bent and aged king, who coughed as he\nwalked.\n\nAt each wicket, all heads were obliged to stoop, except that of the old\nman bent double with age. \"Hum,\" said he between his gums, for he had\nno longer any teeth, \"we are already quite prepared for the door of the\nsepulchre. For a low door, a bent passer.\"\n\nAt length, after having passed a final wicket, so loaded with locks that\na quarter of an hour was required to open it, they entered a vast and\nlofty vaulted hall, in the centre of which they could distinguish by the\nlight of the torches, a huge cubic mass of masonry, iron, and wood. The\ninterior was hollow. It was one of those famous cages of prisoners of\nstate, which were called \"the little daughters of the king.\" In its\nwalls there were two or three little windows so closely trellised with\nstout iron bars; that the glass was not visible. The door was a large\nflat slab of stone, as on tombs; the sort of door which serves for\nentrance only. Only here, the occupant was alive.\n\nThe king began to walk slowly round the little edifice, examining it\ncarefully, while Master Olivier, who followed him, read aloud the note.\n\n\"For having made a great cage of wood of solid beams, timbers and\nwall-plates, measuring nine feet in length by eight in breadth, and of\nthe height of seven feet between the partitions, smoothed and clamped\nwith great bolts of iron, which has been placed in a chamber situated in\none of the towers of the Bastille Saint-Antoine, in which cage is placed\nand detained, by command of the king our lord, a prisoner who formerly\ninhabited an old, decrepit, and ruined cage. There have been employed\nin making the said new cage, ninety-six horizontal beams, and fifty-two\nupright joists, ten wall plates three toises long; there have been\noccupied nineteen carpenters to hew, work, and fit all the said wood in\nthe courtyard of the Bastille during twenty days.\"\n\n\"Very fine heart of oak,\" said the king, striking the woodwork with his\nfist.\n\n\"There have been used in this cage,\" continued the other, \"two hundred\nand twenty great bolts of iron, of nine feet, and of eight, the rest of\nmedium length, with the rowels, caps and counterbands appertaining to\nthe said bolts; weighing, the said iron in all, three thousand, seven\nhundred and thirty-five pounds; beside eight great squares of iron,\nserving to attach the said cage in place with clamps and nails weighing\nin all two hundred and eighteen pounds, not reckoning the iron of the\ntrellises for the windows of the chamber wherein the cage hath been\nplaced, the bars of iron for the door of the cage and other things.\"\n\n\"'Tis a great deal of iron,\" said the king, \"to contain the light of a\nspirit.\"\n\n\"The whole amounts to three hundred and seventeen livres, five sols,\nseven deniers.\"\n\n\"_Pasque-Dieu_!\" exclaimed the king.\n\nAt this oath, which was the favorite of Louis XI., some one seemed\nto awaken in the interior of the cage; the sound of chains was heard,\ngrating on the floor, and a feeble voice, which seemed to issue from the\ntomb was uplifted. \"Sire! sire! mercy!\" The one who spoke thus could not\nbe seen.\n\n\"Three hundred and seventeen livres, five sols, seven deniers,\" repeated\nLouis XI. The lamentable voice which had proceeded from the cage had\nfrozen all present, even Master Olivier himself. The king alone wore\nthe air of not having heard. At his order, Master Olivier resumed his\nreading, and his majesty coldly continued his inspection of the cage.\n\n\"In addition to this there hath been paid to a mason who hath made the\nholes wherein to place the gratings of the windows, and the floor of\nthe chamber where the cage is, because that floor could not support\nthis cage by reason of its weight, twenty-seven livres fourteen sols\nparisis.\"\n\nThe voice began to moan again.\n\n\"Mercy, sire! I swear to you that 'twas Monsieur the Cardinal d'Angers\nand not I, who was guilty of treason.\"\n\n\"The mason is bold!\" said the king. \"Continue, Olivier.\" Olivier\ncontinued,--\n\n\"To a joiner for window frames, bedstead, hollow stool, and other\nthings, twenty livres, two sols parisis.\"\n\nThe voice also continued.\n\n\"Alas, sire! will you not listen to me? I protest to you that 'twas\nnot I who wrote the matter to Monseigneur do Guyenne, but Monsieur le\nCardinal Balue.\"\n\n\"The joiner is dear,\" quoth the king. \"Is that all?\"\n\n\"No, sire. To a glazier, for the windows of the said chamber, forty-six\nsols, eight deniers parisis.\"\n\n\"Have mercy, sire! Is it not enough to have given all my goods to my\njudges, my plate to Monsieur de Torcy, my library to Master Pierre\nDoriolle, my tapestry to the governor of the Roussillon? I am innocent.\nI have been shivering in an iron cage for fourteen years. Have mercy,\nsire! You will find your reward in heaven.\"\n\n\"Master Olivier,\" said the king, \"the total?\"\n\n\"Three hundred sixty-seven livres, eight sols, three deniers parisis.\n\n\"Notre-Dame!\" cried the king. \"This is an outrageous cage!\"\n\nHe tore the book from Master Olivier's hands, and set to reckoning it\nhimself upon his fingers, examining the paper and the cage alternately.\nMeanwhile, the prisoner could be heard sobbing. This was lugubrious in\nthe darkness, and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other.\n\n\"Fourteen years, sire! Fourteen years now! since the month of April,\n1469. In the name of the Holy Mother of God, sire, listen to me! During\nall this time you have enjoyed the heat of the sun. Shall I, frail\ncreature, never more behold the day? Mercy, sire! Be pitiful! Clemency\nis a fine, royal virtue, which turns aside the currents of wrath. Does\nyour majesty believe that in the hour of death it will be a great\ncause of content for a king never to have left any offence unpunished?\nBesides, sire, I did not betray your majesty, 'twas Monsieur d'Angers;\nand I have on my foot a very heavy chain, and a great ball of iron at\nthe end, much heavier than it should be in reason. Eh! sire! Have pity\non me!\"\n\n\"Olivier,\" cried the king, throwing back his head, \"I observe that they\ncharge me twenty sols a hogshead for plaster, while it is worth but\ntwelve. You will refer back this account.\"\n\nHe turned his back on the cage, and set out to leave the room. The\nmiserable prisoner divined from the removal of the torches and the\nnoise, that the king was taking his departure.\n\n\"Sire! sire!\" he cried in despair.\n\nThe door closed again. He no longer saw anything, and heard only the\nhoarse voice of the turnkey, singing in his ears this ditty,--\n\n\n         \"_Ma\u00c3\u00aetre Jean Balue,\n         A perdu la vue\n         De ses \u00c3\u00a9v\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9s.\n         Monsieur de Verdun.\n         N'en a plus pas un;\n         Tous sont d\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00aach\u00c3\u00a9s_.\"*\n\n\n     * Master Jean Balue has lost sight of his bishoprics.\nMonsieur of Verdun has no longer one; all have been killed off.\n\n\nThe king reascended in silence to his retreat, and his suite followed\nhim, terrified by the last groans of the condemned man. All at once his\nmajesty turned to the Governor of the Bastille,--\n\n\"By the way,\" said he, \"was there not some one in that cage?\"\n\n\"Pardieu, yes sire!\" replied the governor, astounded by the question.\n\n\"And who was it?\"\n\n\"Monsieur the Bishop of Verdun.\"\n\nThe king knew this better than any one else. But it was a mania of his.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, with the innocent air of thinking of it for the first\ntime, \"Guillaume de Harancourt, the friend of Monsieur the Cardinal\nBalue. A good devil of a bishop!\"\n\nAt the expiration of a few moments, the door of the retreat had opened\nagain, then closed upon the five personages whom the reader has seen\nat the beginning of this chapter, and who resumed their places, their\nwhispered conversations, and their attitudes.\n\nDuring the king's absence, several despatches had been placed on his\ntable, and he broke the seals himself. Then he began to read them\npromptly, one after the other, made a sign to Master Olivier who\nappeared to exercise the office of minister, to take a pen, and without\ncommunicating to him the contents of the despatches, he began to dictate\nin a low voice, the replies which the latter wrote, on his knees, in an\ninconvenient attitude before the table.\n\nGuillaume Rym was on the watch.\n\nThe king spoke so low that the Flemings heard nothing of his dictation,\nexcept some isolated and rather unintelligible scraps, such as,--\n\n\"To maintain the fertile places by commerce, and the sterile by\nmanufactures....--To show the English lords our four bombards, London,\nBrabant, Bourg-en-Bresse, Saint-Omer....--Artillery is the cause of\nwar being made more judiciously now....--To Monsieur de Bressuire, our\nfriend....--Armies cannot be maintained without tribute, etc.\"\n\nOnce he raised his voice,--\n\n\"_Pasque Dieu_! Monsieur the King of Sicily seals his letters with\nyellow wax, like a king of France. Perhaps we are in the wrong to permit\nhim so to do. My fair cousin of Burgundy granted no armorial bearings\nwith a field of gules. The grandeur of houses is assured by the\nintegrity of prerogatives. Note this, friend Olivier.\"\n\nAgain,--\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" said he, \"What a long message! What doth our brother the\nemperor claim?\" And running his eye over the missive and breaking\nhis reading with interjection: \"Surely! the Germans are so great and\npowerful, that it is hardly credible--But let us not forget the old\nproverb: 'The finest county is Flanders; the finest duchy, Milan; the\nfinest kingdom, France.' Is it not so, Messieurs Flemings?\"\n\nThis time Coppenole bowed in company with Guillaume Rym. The hosier's\npatriotism was tickled.\n\nThe last despatch made Louis XI. frown.\n\n\"What is this?\" he said, \"Complaints and fault finding against our\ngarrisons in Picardy! Olivier, write with diligence to M. the Marshal\nde Rouault:--That discipline is relaxed. That the gendarmes of the\nunattached troops, the feudal nobles, the free archers, and the Swiss\ninflict infinite evils on the rustics.--That the military, not content\nwith what they find in the houses of the rustics, constrain them with\nviolent blows of cudgel or of lash to go and get wine, spices, and other\nunreasonable things in the town.--That monsieur the king knows this.\nThat we undertake to guard our people against inconveniences, larcenies\nand pillage.--That such is our will, by our Lady!--That in addition, it\nsuits us not that any fiddler, barber, or any soldier varlet should be\nclad like a prince, in velvet, cloth of silk, and rings of gold.--That\nthese vanities are hateful to God.--That we, who are gentlemen,\ncontent ourselves with a doublet of cloth at sixteen sols the ell, of\nParis.--That messieurs the camp-followers can very well come down\nto that, also.--Command and ordain.--To Monsieur de Rouault, our\nfriend.--Good.\"\n\nHe dictated this letter aloud, in a firm tone, and in jerks. At the\nmoment when he finished it, the door opened and gave passage to a\nnew personage, who precipitated himself into the chamber, crying in\naffright,--\n\n\"Sire! sire! there is a sedition of the populace in Paris!\" Louis XI.'s\ngrave face contracted; but all that was visible of his emotion passed\naway like a flash of lightning. He controlled himself and said with\ntranquil severity,--\n\n\"Gossip Jacques, you enter very abruptly!\"\n\n\"Sire! sire! there is a revolt!\" repeated Gossip Jacques breathlessly.\n\nThe king, who had risen, grasped him roughly by the arm, and said in\nhis ear, in such a manner as to be heard by him alone, with concentrated\nrage and a sidelong glance at the Flemings,--\n\n\"Hold your tongue! or speak low!\"\n\nThe new comer understood, and began in a low tone to give a very\nterrified account, to which the king listened calmly, while Guillaume\nRym called Coppenole's attention to the face and dress of the new\narrival, to his furred cowl, (_caputia fourrata_), his short cape,\n(_epitogia curta_), his robe of black velvet, which bespoke a president\nof the court of accounts.\n\nHardly had this personage given the king some explanations, when Louis\nXI. exclaimed, bursting into a laugh,--\n\n\"In truth? Speak aloud, Gossip Coictier! What call is there for you\nto talk so low? Our Lady knoweth that we conceal nothing from our good\nfriends the Flemings.\"\n\n\"But sire...\"\n\n\"Speak loud!\"\n\nGossip Coictier was struck dumb with surprise.\n\n\"So,\" resumed the king,--\"speak sir,--there is a commotion among the\nlouts in our good city of Paris?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire.\"\n\n\"And which is moving you say, against monsieur the bailiff of the\nPalais-de-Justice?\"\n\n\"So it appears,\" said the gossip, who still stammered, utterly astounded\nby the abrupt and inexplicable change which had just taken place in the\nking's thoughts.\n\nLouis XI. continued: \"Where did the watch meet the rabble?\"\n\n\"Marching from the Grand Truanderie, towards the Pont-aux-Changeurs. I\nmet it myself as I was on my way hither to obey your majesty's commands.\nI heard some of them shouting: 'Down with the bailiff of the palace!'\"\n\n\"And what complaints have they against the bailiff?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Gossip Jacques, \"because he is their lord.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Yes, sire. They are knaves from the Cour-des-Miracles. They have been\ncomplaining this long while, of the bailiff, whose vassals they are.\nThey do not wish to recognize him either as judge or as voyer?\"*\n\n\n     * One in charge of the highways.\n\n\n\"Yes, certainly!\" retorted the king with a smile of satis-faction which\nhe strove in vain to disguise.\n\n\"In all their petitions to the Parliament, they claim to have but two\nmasters. Your majesty and their God, who is the devil, I believe.\"\n\n\"Eh! eh!\" said the king.\n\nHe rubbed his hands, he laughed with that inward mirth which makes the\ncountenance beam; he was unable to dissimulate his joy, although he\nendeavored at moments to compose himself. No one understood it in the\nleast, not even Master Olivier. He remained silent for a moment, with a\nthoughtful but contented air.\n\n\"Are they in force?\" he suddenly inquired.\n\n\"Yes, assuredly, sire,\" replied Gossip Jacques.\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Six thousand at the least.\"\n\nThe king could not refrain from saying: \"Good!\" he went on,--\n\n\"Are they armed?\"\n\n\"With scythes, pikes, hackbuts, pickaxes. All sorts of very violent\nweapons.\"\n\nThe king did not appear in the least disturbed by this list. Jacques\nconsidered it his duty to add,--\n\n\"If your majesty does not send prompt succor to the bailiff, he is\nlost.\"\n\n\"We will send,\" said the king with an air of false seriousness. \"It is\nwell. Assuredly we will send. Monsieur the bailiff is our friend. Six\nthousand! They are desperate scamps! Their audacity is marvellous, and\nwe are greatly enraged at it. But we have only a few people about us\nto-night. To-morrow morning will be time enough.\"\n\nGossip Jacques exclaimed, \"Instantly, sire! there will be time to sack\nthe bailiwick a score of times, to violate the seignory, to hang the\nbailiff. For God's sake, sire! send before to-morrow morning.\"\n\nThe king looked him full in the face. \"I have told you to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\nIt was one Of those looks to which one does not reply. After a silence,\nLouis XI. raised his voice once more,--\n\n\"You should know that, Gossip Jacques. What was--\"\n\nHe corrected himself. \"What is the bailiff's feudal jurisdiction?\"\n\n\"Sire, the bailiff of the palace has the Rue Calendre as far as the Rue\nde l'Herberie, the Place Saint-Michel, and the localities vulgarly known\nas the Mureaux, situated near the church of Notre-Dame des Champs (here\nLouis XI. raised the brim of his hat), which hotels number thirteen,\nplus the Cour des Miracles, plus the Maladerie, called the Banlieue,\nplus the whole highway which begins at that Maladerie and ends at the\nPorte Sainte-Jacques. Of these divers places he is voyer, high, middle,\nand low, justiciary, full seigneur.\"\n\n\"Bless me!\" said the king, scratching his left ear with his right hand,\n\"that makes a goodly bit of my city! Ah! monsieur the bailiff was king\nof all that.\"\n\nThis time he did not correct himself. He continued dreamily, and as\nthough speaking to himself,--\n\n\"Very fine, monsieur the bailiff! You had there between your teeth a\npretty slice of our Paris.\"\n\nAll at once he broke out explosively, \"_Pasque-Dieu_! What people are\nthose who claim to be voyers, justiciaries, lords and masters in our\ndomains? who have their tollgates at the end of every field? their\ngallows and their hangman at every cross-road among our people? So that\nas the Greek believed that he had as many gods as there were fountains,\nand the Persian as many as he beheld stars, the Frenchman counts as many\nkings as he sees gibbets! Pardieu! 'tis an evil thing, and the confusion\nof it displeases me. I should greatly like to know whether it be the\nmercy of God that there should be in Paris any other lord than the king,\nany other judge than our parliament, any other emperor than ourselves in\nthis empire! By the faith of my soul! the day must certainly come when\nthere shall exist in France but one king, one lord, one judge, one\nheadsman, as there is in paradise but one God!\"\n\nHe lifted his cap again, and continued, still dreamily, with the air\nand accent of a hunter who is cheering on his pack of hounds: \"Good, my\npeople! bravely done! break these false lords! do your duty! at them!\nhave at them! pillage them! take them! sack them!... Ah! you want to be\nkings, messeigneurs? On, my people on!\"\n\nHere he interrupted himself abruptly, bit his lips as though to take\nback his thought which had already half escaped, bent his piercing eyes\nin turn on each of the five persons who surrounded him, and suddenly\ngrasping his hat with both hands and staring full at it, he said to it:\n\"Oh! I would burn you if you knew what there was in my head.\"\n\nThen casting about him once more the cautious and uneasy glance of the\nfox re-entering his hole,--\n\n\"No matter! we will succor monsieur the bailiff. Unfortunately, we have\nbut few troops here at the present moment, against so great a populace.\nWe must wait until to-morrow. The order will be transmitted to the City\nand every one who is caught will be immediately hung.\"\n\n\"By the way, sire,\" said Gossip Coictier, \"I had forgotten that in the\nfirst agitation, the watch have seized two laggards of the band. If your\nmajesty desires to see these men, they are here.\"\n\n\"If I desire to see them!\" cried the king. \"What! _Pasque-Dieu_! You\nforget a thing like that! Run quick, you, Olivier! Go, seek them!\"\n\nMaster Olivier quitted the room and returned a moment later with the two\nprisoners, surrounded by archers of the guard. The first had a coarse,\nidiotic, drunken and astonished face. He was clothed in rags, and walked\nwith one knee bent and dragging his leg. The second had a pallid and\nsmiling countenance, with which the reader is already acquainted.\n\nThe king surveyed them for a moment without uttering a word, then\naddressing the first one abruptly,--\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\n\"Gieffroy Pincebourde.\"\n\n\"Your trade.\"\n\n\"Outcast.\"\n\n\"What were you going to do in this damnable sedition?\" The outcast\nstared at the king, and swung his arms with a stupid air.\n\nHe had one of those awkwardly shaped heads where intelligence is about\nas much at its ease as a light beneath an extinguisher.\n\n\"I know not,\" said he. \"They went, I went.\"\n\n\"Were you not going to outrageously attack and pillage your lord, the\nbailiff of the palace?\"\n\n\"I know that they were going to take something from some one. That is\nall.\"\n\nA soldier pointed out to the king a billhook which he had seized on the\nperson of the vagabond.\n\n\"Do you recognize this weapon?\" demanded the king.\n\n\"Yes; 'tis my billhook; I am a vine-dresser.\"\n\n\"And do you recognize this man as your companion?\" added Louis XI.,\npointing to the other prisoner.\n\n\"No, I do not know him.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said the king, making a sign with his finger to the\nsilent personage who stood motionless beside the door, to whom we have\nalready called the reader's attention.\n\n\"Gossip Tristan, here is a man for you.\"\n\nTristan l'Hermite bowed. He gave an order in a low voice to two archers,\nwho led away the poor vagabond.\n\nIn the meantime, the king had approached the second prisoner, who was\nperspiring in great drops: \"Your name?\"\n\n\"Sire, Pierre Gringoire.\"\n\n\"Your trade?\"\n\n\"Philosopher, sire.\"\n\n\"How do you permit yourself, knave, to go and besiege our friend,\nmonsieur the bailiff of the palace, and what have you to say concerning\nthis popular agitation?\"\n\n\"Sire, I had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Come, now! you wanton wretch, were not you apprehended by the watch in\nthat bad company?\"\n\n\"No, sire, there is a mistake. 'Tis a fatality. I make tragedies. Sire,\nI entreat your majesty to listen to me. I am a poet. 'Tis the melancholy\nway of men of my profession to roam the streets by night. I was passing\nthere. It was mere chance. I was unjustly arrested; I am innocent\nof this civil tempest. Your majesty sees that the vagabond did not\nrecognize me. I conjure your majesty--\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said the king, between two swallows of his ptisan.\n\"You split our head!\"\n\nTristan l'Hermite advanced and pointing to Gringoire,--\n\n\"Sire, can this one be hanged also?\"\n\nThis was the first word that he had uttered.\n\n\"Phew!\" replied the king, \"I see no objection.\"\n\n\"I see a great many!\" said Gringoire.\n\nAt that moment, our philosopher was greener than an olive. He perceived\nfrom the king's cold and indifferent mien that there was no other\nresource than something very pathetic, and he flung himself at the feet\nof Louis XI., exclaiming, with gestures of despair:--\n\n\"Sire! will your majesty deign to hear me. Sire! break not in thunder\nover so small a thing as myself. God's great lightning doth not bombard\na lettuce. Sire, you are an august and, very puissant monarch; have pity\non a poor man who is honest, and who would find it more difficult to\nstir up a revolt than a cake of ice would to give out a spark! Very\ngracious sire, kindness is the virtue of a lion and a king. Alas! rigor\nonly frightens minds; the impetuous gusts of the north wind do not make\nthe traveller lay aside his cloak; the sun, bestowing his rays little by\nlittle, warms him in such ways that it will make him strip to his shirt.\nSire, you are the sun. I protest to you, my sovereign lord and master,\nthat I am not an outcast, thief, and disorderly fellow. Revolt and\nbrigandage belong not to the outfit of Apollo. I am not the man to fling\nmyself into those clouds which break out into seditious clamor. I am\nyour majesty's faithful vassal. That same jealousy which a husband\ncherisheth for the honor of his wife, the resentment which the son hath\nfor the love of his father, a good vassal should feel for the glory\nof his king; he should pine away for the zeal of this house, for\nthe aggrandizement of his service. Every other passion which should\ntransport him would be but madness. These, sire, are my maxims of state:\nthen do not judge me to be a seditious and thieving rascal because my\ngarment is worn at the elbows. If you will grant me mercy, sire, I will\nwear it out on the knees in praying to God for you night and morning!\nAlas! I am not extremely rich, 'tis true. I am even rather poor. But\nnot vicious on that account. It is not my fault. Every one knoweth that\ngreat wealth is not to be drawn from literature, and that those who are\nbest posted in good books do not always have a great fire in winter.\nThe advocate's trade taketh all the grain, and leaveth only straw to the\nother scientific professions. There are forty very excellent proverbs\nanent the hole-ridden cloak of the philosopher. Oh, sire! clemency is\nthe only light which can enlighten the interior of so great a soul.\nClemency beareth the torch before all the other virtues. Without it they\nare but blind men groping after God in the dark. Compassion, which is\nthe same thing as clemency, causeth the love of subjects, which is the\nmost powerful bodyguard to a prince. What matters it to your majesty,\nwho dazzles all faces, if there is one poor man more on earth, a poor\ninnocent philosopher spluttering amid the shadows of calamity, with an\nempty pocket which resounds against his hollow belly? Moreover, sire,\nI am a man of letters. Great kings make a pearl for their crowns by\nprotecting letters. Hercules did not disdain the title of Musagetes.\nMathias Corvin favored Jean de Monroyal, the ornament of mathematics.\nNow, 'tis an ill way to protect letters to hang men of letters. What a\nstain on Alexander if he had hung Aristoteles! This act would not be a\nlittle patch on the face of his reputation to embellish it, but a very\nmalignant ulcer to disfigure it. Sire! I made a very proper epithalamium\nfor Mademoiselle of Flanders and Monseigneur the very august Dauphin.\nThat is not a firebrand of rebellion. Your majesty sees that I am not\na scribbler of no reputation, that I have studied excellently well, and\nthat I possess much natural eloquence. Have mercy upon me, sire! In so\ndoing you will perform a gallant deed to our Lady, and I swear to you\nthat I am greatly terrified at the idea of being hanged!\"\n\nSo saying, the unhappy Gringoire kissed the king's slippers, and\nGuillaume Rym said to Coppenole in a low tone: \"He doth well to drag\nhimself on the earth. Kings are like the Jupiter of Crete, they have\nears only in their feet.\" And without troubling himself about the\nJupiter of Crete, the hosier replied with a heavy smile, and his eyes\nfixed on Gringoire: \"Oh! that's it exactly! I seem to hear Chancellor\nHugonet craving mercy of me.\"\n\nWhen Gringoire paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head\ntremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in scratching a spot on\nthe knee of his breeches with his finger-nail; then his majesty began\nto drink from the goblet of ptisan. But he uttered not a word, and this\nsilence tortured Gringoire. At last the king looked at him. \"Here is a\nterrible bawler!\" said, he. Then, turning to Tristan l'Hermite, \"Bali!\nlet him go!\"\n\nGringoire fell backwards, quite thunderstruck with joy.\n\n\"At liberty!\" growled Tristan \"Doth not your majesty wish to have him\ndetained a little while in a cage?\"\n\n\"Gossip,\" retorted Louis XI., \"think you that 'tis for birds of this\nfeather that we cause to be made cages at three hundred and sixty-seven\nlivres, eight sous, three deniers apiece? Release him at once,\nthe wanton (Louis XI. was fond of this word which formed, with\n_Pasque-Dieu_, the foundation of his joviality), and put him out with a\nbuffet.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" cried Gringoire, \"what a great king is here!\"\n\nAnd for fear of a counter order, he rushed towards the door, which\nTristan opened for him with a very bad grace. The soldiers left the room\nwith him, pushing him before them with stout thwacks, which Gringoire\nbore like a true stoical philosopher.\n\nThe king's good humor since the revolt against the bailiff had been\nannounced to him, made itself apparent in every way. This unwonted\nclemency was no small sign of it. Tristan l'Hermite in his corner wore\nthe surly look of a dog who has had a bone snatched away from him.\n\nMeanwhile, the king thrummed gayly with his fingers on the arm of his\nchair, the March of Pont-Audemer. He was a dissembling prince, but one\nwho understood far better how to hide his troubles than his joys. These\nexternal manifestations of joy at any good news sometimes proceeded to\nvery great lengths thus, on the death, of Charles the Bold, to the point\nof vowing silver balustrades to Saint Martin of Tours; on his advent to\nthe throne, so far as forgetting to order his father's obsequies.\n\n\"H\u00c3\u00a9! sire!\" suddenly exclaimed Jacques Coictier, \"what has become of the\nacute attack of illness for which your majesty had me summoned?\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said the king, \"I really suffer greatly, my gossip. There is a\nhissing in my ear and fiery rakes rack my chest.\"\n\nCoictier took the king's hand, and begun to feel of his pulse with a\nknowing air.\n\n\"Look, Coppenole,\" said Rym, in a low voice. \"Behold him between\nCoictier and Tristan. They are his whole court. A physician for himself,\na headsman for others.\"\n\nAs he felt the king's pulse, Coictier assumed an air of greater and\ngreater alarm. Louis XI. watched him with some anxiety. Coictier grew\nvisibly more gloomy. The brave man had no other farm than the king's bad\nhealth. He speculated on it to the best of his ability.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" he murmured at length, \"this is serious indeed.\"\n\n\"Is it not?\" said the king, uneasily.\n\n\"_Pulsus creber, anhelans, crepitans, irregularis_,\" continued the\nleech.\n\n\"_Pasque-Dieu_!\"\n\n\"This may carry off its man in less than three days.\"\n\n\"Our Lady!\" exclaimed the king. \"And the remedy, gossip?\"\n\n\"I am meditating upon that, sire.\"\n\nHe made Louis XI. put out his tongue, shook his head, made a grimace,\nand in the very midst of these affectations,--\n\n\"Pardieu, sire,\" he suddenly said, \"I must tell you that there is\na receivership of the royal prerogatives vacant, and that I have a\nnephew.\"\n\n\"I give the receivership to your nephew, Gossip Jacques,\" replied the\nking; \"but draw this fire from my breast.\"\n\n\"Since your majesty is so clement,\" replied the leech, \"you will\nnot refuse to aid me a little in building my house, Rue\nSaint-Andr\u00c3\u00a9-des-Arcs.\"\n\n\"Heugh!\" said the king.\n\n\"I am at the end of my finances,\" pursued the doctor; \"and it would\nreally be a pity that the house should not have a roof; not on account\nof the house, which is simple and thoroughly bourgeois, but because of\nthe paintings of Jehan Fourbault, which adorn its wainscoating. There is\na Diana flying in the air, but so excellent, so tender, so delicate,\nof so ingenuous an action, her hair so well coiffed and adorned with a\ncrescent, her flesh so white, that she leads into temptation those who\nregard her too curiously. There is also a Ceres. She is another very\nfair divinity. She is seated on sheaves of wheat and crowned with a\ngallant garland of wheat ears interlaced with salsify and other flowers.\nNever were seen more amorous eyes, more rounded limbs, a nobler air,\nor a more gracefully flowing skirt. She is one of the most innocent and\nmost perfect beauties whom the brush has ever produced.\"\n\n\"Executioner!\" grumbled Louis XI., \"what are you driving at?\"\n\n\"I must have a roof for these paintings, sire, and, although 'tis but a\nsmall matter, I have no more money.\"\n\n\"How much doth your roof cost?\"\n\n\"Why a roof of copper, embellished and gilt, two thousand livres at the\nmost.\"\n\n\"Ah, assassin!\" cried the king, \"He never draws out one of my teeth\nwhich is not a diamond.\"\n\n\"Am I to have my roof?\" said Coictier.\n\n\"Yes; and go to the devil, but cure me.\"\n\nJacques Coictier bowed low and said,--\n\n\"Sire, it is a repellent which will save you. We will apply to your\nloins the great defensive composed of cerate, Armenian bole, white of\negg, oil, and vinegar. You will continue your ptisan and we will answer\nfor your majesty.\"\n\nA burning candle does not attract one gnat alone. Master Olivier,\nperceiving the king to be in a liberal mood, and judging the moment to\nbe propitious, approached in his turn.\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"What is it now?\" said Louis XI. \"Sire, your majesty knoweth that Simon\nRadin is dead?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He was councillor to the king in the matter of the courts of the\ntreasury.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Sire, his place is vacant.\"\n\nAs he spoke thus, Master Olivier's haughty face quitted its arrogant\nexpression for a lowly one. It is the only change which ever takes place\nin a courtier's visage. The king looked him well in the face and said in\na dry tone,--\"I understand.\"\n\nHe resumed,\n\n\"Master Olivier, the Marshal de Boucicaut was wont to say, 'There's no\nmaster save the king, there are no fishes save in the sea.' I see that\nyou agree with Monsieur de Boucicaut. Now listen to this; we have a good\nmemory. In '68 we made you valet of our chamber: in '69, guardian of the\nfortress of the bridge of Saint-Cloud, at a hundred livres of Tournay in\nwages (you wanted them of Paris). In November, '73, by letters given\nto Gergeole, we instituted you keeper of the Wood of Vincennes, in\nthe place of Gilbert Acle, equerry; in '75, gruyer* of the forest of\nRouvray-lez-Saint-Cloud, in the place of Jacques le Maire; in '78, we\ngraciously settled on you, by letters patent sealed doubly with green\nwax, an income of ten livres parisis, for you and your wife, on the\nPlace of the Merchants, situated at the School Saint-Germain; in '79,\nwe made you gruyer of the forest of Senart, in place of that poor\nJehan Daiz; then captain of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2teau of Loches; then governor of\nSaint-Quentin; then captain of the bridge of Meulan, of which you cause\nyourself to be called comte. Out of the five sols fine paid by every\nbarber who shaves on a festival day, there are three sols for you and\nwe have the rest. We have been good enough to change your name of Le\nMauvais (The Evil), which resembled your face too closely. In '76, we\ngranted you, to the great displeasure of our nobility, armorial\nbearings of a thousand colors, which give you the breast of a peacock.\n_Pasque-Dieu_! Are not you surfeited? Is not the draught of fishes\nsufficiently fine and miraculous? Are you not afraid that one salmon\nmore will make your boat sink? Pride will be your ruin, gossip. Ruin and\ndisgrace always press hard on the heels of pride. Consider this and hold\nyour tongue.\"\n\n\n     *  A lord having a right on the woods of his vassals.\n\n\nThese words, uttered with severity, made Master Olivier's face revert to\nits insolence.\n\n\"Good!\" he muttered, almost aloud, \"'tis easy to see that the king is\nill to-day; he giveth all to the leech.\"\n\nLouis XI. far from being irritated by this petulant insult, resumed with\nsome gentleness, \"Stay, I was forgetting that I made you my ambassador\nto Madame Marie, at Ghent. Yes, gentlemen,\" added the king turning to\nthe Flemings, \"this man hath been an ambassador. There, my gossip,\" he\npursued, addressing Master Olivier, \"let us not get angry; we are old\nfriends. 'Tis very late. We have terminated our labors. Shave me.\"\n\nOur readers have not, without doubt, waited until the present moment to\nrecognize in Master Olivier that terrible Figaro whom Providence, the\ngreat maker of dramas, mingled so artistically in the long and bloody\ncomedy of the reign of Louis XI. We will not here undertake to develop\nthat singular figure. This barber of the king had three names. At court\nhe was politely called Olivier le Daim (the Deer); among the people\nOlivier the Devil. His real name was Olivier le Mauvais.\n\nAccordingly, Olivier le Mauvais remained motionless, sulking at the\nking, and glancing askance at Jacques Coictier.\n\n\"Yes, yes, the physician!\" he said between his teeth.\n\n\"Ah, yes, the physician!\" retorted Louis XI., with singular good humor;\n\"the physician has more credit than you. 'Tis very simple; he has taken\nhold upon us by the whole body, and you hold us only by the chin. Come,\nmy poor barber, all will come right. What would you say and what would\nbecome of your office if I were a king like Chilperic, whose gesture\nconsisted in holding his beard in one hand? Come, gossip mine, fulfil\nyour office, shave me. Go get what you need therefor.\"\n\nOlivier perceiving that the king had made up his mind to laugh, and that\nthere was no way of even annoying him, went off grumbling to execute his\norders.\n\nThe king rose, approached the window, and suddenly opening it with\nextraordinary agitation,--\n\n\"Oh! yes!\" he exclaimed, clapping his hands, \"yonder is a redness in the\nsky over the City. 'Tis the bailiff burning. It can be nothing else but\nthat. Ah! my good people! here you are aiding me at last in tearing down\nthe rights of lordship!\"\n\nThen turning towards the Flemings: \"Come, look at this, gentlemen. Is it\nnot a fire which gloweth yonder?\"\n\nThe two men of Ghent drew near.\n\n\"A great fire,\" said Guillaume Rym.\n\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Coppenole, whose eyes suddenly flashed, \"that reminds me\nof the burning of the house of the Seigneur d'Hymbercourt. There must be\na goodly revolt yonder.\"\n\n\"You think so, Master Coppenole?\" And Louis XI.'s glance was almost as\njoyous as that of the hosier. \"Will it not be difficult to resist?\"\n\n\"Cross of God! Sire! Your majesty will damage many companies of men of\nwar thereon.\"\n\n\"Ah! I! 'tis different,\" returned the king. \"If I willed.\" The hosier\nreplied hardily,--\n\n\"If this revolt be what I suppose, sire, you might will in vain.\"\n\n\"Gossip,\" said Louis XI., \"with the two companies of my unattached\ntroops and one discharge of a serpentine, short work is made of a\npopulace of louts.\"\n\nThe hosier, in spite of the signs made to him by Guillaume Rym, appeared\ndetermined to hold his own against the king.\n\n\"Sire, the Swiss were also louts. Monsieur the Duke of Burgundy was a\ngreat gentleman, and he turned up his nose at that rabble rout. At the\nbattle of Grandson, sire, he cried: 'Men of the cannon! Fire on the\nvillains!' and he swore by Saint-George. But Advoyer Scharnachtal hurled\nhimself on the handsome duke with his battle-club and his people, and\nwhen the glittering Burgundian army came in contact with these peasants\nin bull hides, it flew in pieces like a pane of glass at the blow of a\npebble. Many lords were then slain by low-born knaves; and Monsieur de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teau-Guyon, the greatest seigneur in Burgundy, was found dead, with\nhis gray horse, in a little marsh meadow.\"\n\n\"Friend,\" returned the king, \"you are speaking of a battle. The question\nhere is of a mutiny. And I will gain the upper hand of it as soon as it\nshall please me to frown.\"\n\nThe other replied indifferently,--\n\n\"That may be, sire; in that case, 'tis because the people's hour hath\nnot yet come.\"\n\nGuillaume Rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene,--\n\n\"Master Coppenole, you are speaking to a puissant king.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" replied the hosier, gravely.\n\n\"Let him speak, Monsieur Rym, my friend,\" said the king; \"I love this\nfrankness of speech. My father, Charles the Seventh, was accustomed\nto say that the truth was ailing; I thought her dead, and that she had\nfound no confessor. Master Coppenole undeceiveth me.\"\n\nThen, laying his hand familiarly on Coppenole's shoulder,--\n\n\"You were saying, Master Jacques?\"\n\n\"I say, sire, that you may possibly be in the right, that the hour of\nthe people may not yet have come with you.\"\n\nLouis XI. gazed at him with his penetrating eye,--\n\n\"And when will that hour come, master?\"\n\n\"You will hear it strike.\"\n\n\"On what clock, if you please?\"\n\nCoppenole, with his tranquil and rustic countenance, made the king\napproach the window.\n\n\"Listen, sire! There is here a donjon keep, a belfry, cannons,\nbourgeois, soldiers; when the belfry shall hum, when the cannons\nshall roar, when the donjon shall fall in ruins amid great noise, when\nbourgeois and soldiers shall howl and slay each other, the hour will\nstrike.\"\n\nLouis's face grew sombre and dreamy. He remained silent for a moment,\nthen he gently patted with his hand the thick wall of the donjon, as one\nstrokes the haunches of a steed.\n\n\"Oh! no!\" said he. \"You will not crumble so easily, will you, my good\nBastille?\"\n\nAnd turning with an abrupt gesture towards the sturdy Fleming,--\n\n\"Have you never seen a revolt, Master Jacques?\"\n\n\"I have made them,\" said the hosier.\n\n\"How do you set to work to make a revolt?\" said the king.\n\n\"Ah!\" replied Coppenole, \"'tis not very difficult. There are a hundred\nways. In the first place, there must be discontent in the city. The\nthing is not uncommon. And then, the character of the inhabitants. Those\nof Ghent are easy to stir into revolt. They always love the prince's\nson; the prince, never. Well! One morning, I will suppose, some one\nenters my shop, and says to me: 'Father Coppenole, there is this and\nthere is that, the Demoiselle of Flanders wishes to save her ministers,\nthe grand bailiff is doubling the impost on shagreen, or something\nelse,'--what you will. I leave my work as it stands, I come out of my\nhosier's stall, and I shout: 'To the sack?' There is always some smashed\ncask at hand. I mount it, and I say aloud, in the first words that occur\nto me, what I have on my heart; and when one is of the people, sire,\none always has something on the heart: Then people troop up, they shout,\nthey ring the alarm bell, they arm the louts with what they take from\nthe soldiers, the market people join in, and they set out. And it will\nalways be thus, so long as there are lords in the seignories, bourgeois\nin the bourgs, and peasants in the country.\"\n\n\"And against whom do you thus rebel?\" inquired the king; \"against your\nbailiffs? against your lords?\"\n\n\"Sometimes; that depends. Against the duke, also, sometimes.\"\n\nLouis XI. returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,--\n\n\"Ah! here they have only got as far as the bailiffs.\"\n\nAt that instant Olivier le Daim returned. He was followed by two pages,\nwho bore the king's toilet articles; but what struck Louis XI. was that\nhe was also accompanied by the provost of Paris and the chevalier of\nthe watch, who appeared to be in consternation. The spiteful barber\nalso wore an air of consternation, which was one of contentment beneath,\nhowever. It was he who spoke first.\n\n\"Sire, I ask your majesty's pardon for the calamitous news which I\nbring.\"\n\nThe king turned quickly and grazed the mat on the floor with the feet of\nhis chair,--\n\n\"What does this mean?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" resumed Olivier le Daim, with the malicious air of a man who\nrejoices that he is about to deal a violent blow, \"'tis not against the\nbailiff of the courts that this popular sedition is directed.\"\n\n\"Against whom, then?\"\n\n\"Against you, sire?'\n\nThe aged king rose erect and straight as a young man,--\n\n\"Explain yourself, Olivier! And guard your head well, gossip; for I\nswear to you by the cross of Saint-L\u00c3\u00b4 that, if you lie to us at this\nhour, the sword which severed the head of Monsieur de Luxembourg is not\nso notched that it cannot yet sever yours!\"\n\nThe oath was formidable; Louis XI. had only sworn twice in the course of\nhis life by the cross of Saint-L\u00c3\u00b4.\n\nOlivier opened his mouth to reply.\n\n\"Sire--\"\n\n\"On your knees!\" interrupted the king violently. \"Tristan, have an eye\nto this man.\"\n\nOlivier knelt down and said coldly,--\n\n\"Sire, a sorceress was condemned to death by your court of parliament.\nShe took refuge in Notre-Dame. The people are trying to take her from\nthence by main force. Monsieur the provost and monsieur the chevalier of\nthe watch, who have just come from the riot, are here to give me the lie\nif this is not the truth. The populace is besieging Notre-Dame.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed!\" said the king in a low voice, all pale and trembling with\nwrath. \"Notre-Dame! They lay siege to our Lady, my good mistress in\nher cathedral!--Rise, Olivier. You are right. I give you Simon Radin's\ncharge. You are right. 'Tis I whom they are attacking. The witch is\nunder the protection of this church, the church is under my protection.\nAnd I thought that they were acting against the bailiff! 'Tis against\nmyself!\"\n\nThen, rendered young by fury, he began to walk up and down with long\nstrides. He no longer laughed, he was terrible, he went and came; the\nfox was changed into a hyaena. He seemed suffocated to such a degree\nthat he could not speak; his lips moved, and his fleshless fists were\nclenched. All at once he raised his head, his hollow eye appeared full\nof light, and his voice burst forth like a clarion: \"Down with them,\nTristan! A heavy hand for these rascals! Go, Tristan, my friend! slay!\nslay!\"\n\nThis eruption having passed, he returned to his seat, and said with cold\nand concentrated wrath,--\n\n\"Here, Tristan! There are here with us in the Bastille the fifty lances\nof the Vicomte de Gif, which makes three hundred horse: you will take\nthem. There is also the company of our unattached archers of Monsieur de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers: you will take it. You are provost of the marshals; you have\nthe men of your provostship: you will take them. At the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Saint-Pol\nyou will find forty archers of monsieur the dauphin's new guard: you\nwill take them. And, with all these, you will hasten to Notre-Dame.\nAh! messieurs, louts of Paris, do you fling yourselves thus against\nthe crown of France, the sanctity of Notre-Dame, and the peace of this\ncommonwealth! Exterminate, Tristan! exterminate! and let not a single\none escape, except it be for Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on.\"\n\nTristan bowed. \"'Tis well, sire.\"\n\nHe added, after a silence, \"And what shall I do with the sorceress?\"\n\nThis question caused the king to meditate.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"the sorceress! Monsieur d'Estouteville, what did the\npeople wish to do with her?\"\n\n\"Sire,\" replied the provost of Paris, \"I imagine that since the populace\nhas come to tear her from her asylum in Notre-Dame, 'tis because that\nimpunity wounds them, and they desire to hang her.\"\n\nThe king appeared to reflect deeply: then, addressing Tristan l'Hermite,\n\"Well! gossip, exterminate the people and hang the sorceress.\"\n\n\"That's it,\" said Rym in a low tone to Coppenole, \"punish the people for\nwilling a thing, and then do what they wish.\"\n\n\"Enough, sire,\" replied Tristan. \"If the sorceress is still in\nNotre-Dame, must she be seized in spite of the sanctuary?\"\n\n\"_Pasque-Dieu_! the sanctuary!\" said the king, scratching his ear. \"But\nthe woman must be hung, nevertheless.\"\n\nHere, as though seized with a sudden idea, he flung himself on his knees\nbefore his chair, took off his hat, placed it on the seat, and gazing\ndevoutly at one of the leaden amulets which loaded it down, \"Oh!\" said\nhe, with clasped hands, \"our Lady of Paris, my gracious patroness,\npardon me. I will only do it this once. This criminal must be punished.\nI assure you, madame the virgin, my good mistress, that she is a\nsorceress who is not worthy of your amiable protection. You know,\nmadame, that many very pious princes have overstepped the privileges\nof the churches for the glory of God and the necessities of the State.\nSaint Hugues, bishop of England, permitted King Edward to hang a witch\nin his church. Saint-Louis of France, my master, transgressed, with the\nsame object, the church of Monsieur Saint-Paul; and Monsieur Alphonse,\nson of the king of Jerusalem, the very church of the Holy Sepulchre.\nPardon me, then, for this once. Our Lady of Paris, I will never do so\nagain, and I will give you a fine statue of silver, like the one which I\ngave last year to Our Lady of Ecouys. So be it.\"\n\nHe made the sign of the cross, rose, donned his hat once more, and said\nto Tristan,--\n\n\"Be diligent, gossip. Take Monsieur Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers with you. You will cause\nthe tocsin to be sounded. You will crush the populace. You will seize\nthe witch. 'Tis said. And I mean the business of the execution to be\ndone by you. You will render me an account of it. Come, Olivier, I shall\nnot go to bed this night. Shave me.\"\n\nTristan l'Hermite bowed and departed. Then the king, dismissing Rym and\nCoppenole with a gesture,--\n\n\"God guard you, messieurs, my good friends the Flemings. Go, take a\nlittle repose. The night advances, and we are nearer the morning than\nthe evening.\"\n\nBoth retired and gained their apartments under the guidance of the\ncaptain of the Bastille. Coppenole said to Guillaume Rym,--\n\n\"Hum! I have had enough of that coughing king! I have seen Charles of\nBurgundy drunk, and he was less malignant than Louis XI. when ailing.\"\n\n\"Master Jacques,\" replied Rym, \"'tis because wine renders kings less\ncruel than does barley water.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. LITTLE SWORD IN POCKET.\n\n\n\nOn emerging from the Bastille, Gringoire descended the Rue Saint-Antoine\nwith the swiftness of a runaway horse. On arriving at the Baudoyer gate,\nhe walked straight to the stone cross which rose in the middle of that\nplace, as though he were able to distinguish in the darkness the figure\nof a man clad and cloaked in black, who was seated on the steps of the\ncross.\n\n\"Is it you, master?\" said Gringoire.\n\nThe personage in black rose.\n\n\"Death and passion! You make me boil, Gringoire. The man on the tower of\nSaint-Gervais has just cried half-past one o'clock in the morning.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" retorted Gringoire, \"'tis no fault of mine, but of the watch and\nthe king. I have just had a narrow escape. I always just miss being\nhung. 'Tis my predestination.\"\n\n\"You lack everything,\" said the other. \"But come quickly. Have you the\npassword?\"\n\n\"Fancy, master, I have seen the king. I come from him. He wears fustian\nbreeches. 'Tis an adventure.\"\n\n\"Oh! distaff of words! what is your adventure to me! Have you the\npassword of the outcasts?\"\n\n\"I have it. Be at ease. 'Little sword in pocket.'\"\n\n\"Good. Otherwise, we could not make our way as far as the church.\nThe outcasts bar the streets. Fortunately, it appears that they have\nencountered resistance. We may still arrive in time.\"\n\n\"Yes, master, but how are we to get into Notre-Dame?\"\n\n\"I have the key to the tower.\"\n\n\"And how are we to get out again?\"\n\n\"Behind the cloister there is a little door which opens on the Terrain\nand the water. I have taken the key to it, and I moored a boat there\nthis morning.\"\n\n\"I have had a beautiful escape from being hung!\" Gringoire repeated.\n\n\"Eh, quick! come!\" said the other.\n\nBoth descended towards the city with long strides.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. CHATEAUPERS TO THE RESCUE.\n\n\n\nThe reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left\nQuasimodo. The brave deaf man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if\nnot all courage, at least all hope of saving, not himself (he was not\nthinking of himself), but the gypsy. He ran distractedly along the\ngallery. Notre-Dame was on the point of being taken by storm by\nthe outcasts. All at once, a great galloping of horses filled the\nneighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column\nof cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds\ndebouched on the Place like a hurricane,--\n\n\"France! France! cut down the louts! Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers to the rescue!\nProvostship! Provostship!\"\n\nThe frightened vagabonds wheeled round.\n\nQuasimodo who did not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the\nirons of the pikes, all that cavalry, at the head of which he recognized\nCaptain Phoebus; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts, the terror\nof some, the disturbance among the bravest of them, and from this\nunexpected succor he recovered so much strength, that he hurled from the\nchurch the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery.\n\nIt was, in fact, the king's troops who had arrived. The vagabonds\nbehaved bravely. They defended themselves like desperate men. Caught on\nthe flank, by the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs, and in the rear through\nthe Rue du Parvis, driven to bay against Notre-Dame, which they\nstill assailed and Quasimodo defended, at the same time besiegers and\nbesieged, they were in the singular situation in which Comte Henri\nHarcourt, _Taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus_, as his epitaph says,\nfound himself later on, at the famous siege of Turin, in 1640, between\nPrince Thomas of Savoy, whom he was besieging, and the Marquis de\nLeganez, who was blockading him.\n\nThe battle was frightful. There was a dog's tooth for wolf's flesh,\nas P. Mathieu says. The king's cavaliers, in whose midst Phoebus de\nCh\u00c3\u00a2teaupers bore himself valiantly, gave no quarter, and the slash of\nthe sword disposed of those who escaped the thrust of the lance. The\noutcasts, badly armed foamed and bit with rage. Men, women, children,\nhurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses, and\nhung there like cats, with teeth, finger nails and toe nails. Others\nstruck the archers' in the face with their torches. Others thrust\niron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and dragged them down. They\nslashed in pieces those who fell.\n\nOne was noticed who had a large, glittering scythe, and who, for a long\ntime, mowed the legs of the horses. He was frightful. He was singing\na ditty, with a nasal intonation, he swung and drew back his scythe\nincessantly. At every blow he traced around him a great circle of\nsevered limbs. He advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry,\nwith the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular\nbreathing of a harvester attacking a field of wheat. It was Chopin\nTrouillefou. A shot from an arquebus laid him low.\n\nIn the meantime, windows had been opened again. The neighbors hearing\nthe war cries of the king's troops, had mingled in the affray, and\nbullets rained upon the outcasts from every story. The Parvis was filled\nwith a thick smoke, which the musketry streaked with flame. Through\nit one could confusedly distinguish the front of Notre-Dame, and the\ndecrepit H\u00c3\u00b4tel-Dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights\nof its roof all checkered with dormer windows.\n\nAt length the vagabonds gave way. Weariness, the lack of good weapons,\nthe fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant\nattack of the king's troops, all overwhelmed them. They forced the\nline of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the Parvis\nencumbered with dead.\n\nWhen Quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld\nthis rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then,\nintoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird\nto that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended.\nHe had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just\nsaved for the second time.\n\nWhen he entered the cell, he found it empty.\n\n\n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVENTH.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. THE LITTLE SHOE.\n\n\n\nLa Esmeralda was sleeping at the moment when the outcasts assailed the\nchurch.\n\nSoon the ever-increasing uproar around the edifice, and the uneasy\nbleating of her goat which had been awakened, had roused her from\nher slumbers. She had sat up, she had listened, she had looked; then,\nterrified by the light and noise, she had rushed from her cell to see.\nThe aspect of the Place, the vision which was moving in it, the disorder\nof that nocturnal assault, that hideous crowd, leaping like a cloud of\nfrogs, half seen in the gloom, the croaking of that hoarse multitude,\nthose few red torches running and crossing each other in the darkness\nlike the meteors which streak the misty surfaces of marshes, this whole\nscene produced upon her the effect of a mysterious battle between the\nphantoms of the witches' sabbath and the stone monsters of the church.\nImbued from her very infancy with the superstitions of the Bohemian\ntribe, her first thought was that she had caught the strange beings\npeculiar to the night, in their deeds of witchcraft. Then she ran in\nterror to cower in her cell, asking of her pallet some less terrible\nnightmare.\n\nBut little by little the first vapors of terror had been dissipated;\nfrom the constantly increasing noise, and from many other signs of\nreality, she felt herself besieged not by spectres, but by human beings.\nThen her fear, though it did not increase, changed its character. She\nhad dreamed of the possibility of a popular mutiny to tear her from her\nasylum. The idea of once more recovering life, hope, Phoebus, who was\never present in her future, the extreme helplessness of her condition,\nflight cut off, no support, her abandonment, her isolation,--these\nthoughts and a thousand others overwhelmed her. She fell upon her knees,\nwith her head on her bed, her hands clasped over her head, full of\nanxiety and tremors, and, although a gypsy, an idolater, and a pagan,\nshe began to entreat with sobs, mercy from the good Christian God, and\nto pray to our Lady, her hostess. For even if one believes in nothing,\nthere are moments in life when one is always of the religion of the\ntemple which is nearest at hand.\n\nShe remained thus prostrate for a very long time, trembling in truth,\nmore than praying, chilled by the ever-closer breath of that furious\nmultitude, understanding nothing of this outburst, ignorant of what was\nbeing plotted, what was being done, what they wanted, but foreseeing a\nterrible issue.\n\nIn the midst of this anguish, she heard some one walking near her. She\nturned round. Two men, one of whom carried a lantern, had just entered\nher cell. She uttered a feeble cry.\n\n\"Fear nothing,\" said a voice which was not unknown to her, \"it is I.\"\n\n\"Who are you?\" she asked.\n\n\"Pierre Gringoire.\"\n\nThis name reassured her. She raised her eyes once more, and recognized\nthe poet in very fact. But there stood beside him a black figure veiled\nfrom head to foot, which struck her by its silence.\n\n\"Oh!\" continued Gringoire in a tone of reproach, \"Djali recognized me\nbefore you!\"\n\nThe little goat had not, in fact, waited for Gringoire to announce his\nname. No sooner had he entered than it rubbed itself gently against his\nknees, covering the poet with caresses and with white hairs, for it was\nshedding its hair. Gringoire returned the caresses.\n\n\"Who is this with you?\" said the gypsy, in a low voice.\n\n\"Be at ease,\" replied Gringoire. \"'Tis one of my friends.\" Then the\nphilosopher setting his lantern on the ground, crouched upon the stones,\nand exclaimed enthusiastically, as he pressed Djali in his arms,--\n\n\"Oh! 'tis a graceful beast, more considerable no doubt, for it's\nneatness than for its size, but ingenious, subtle, and lettered as a\ngrammarian! Let us see, my Djali, hast thou forgotten any of thy pretty\ntricks? How does Master Jacques Charmolue?...\"\n\nThe man in black did not allow him to finish. He approached Gringoire\nand shook him roughly by the shoulder.\n\nGringoire rose.\n\n\"'Tis true,\" said he: \"I forgot that we are in haste. But that is no\nreason master, for getting furious with people in this manner. My dear\nand lovely child, your life is in danger, and Djali's also. They want\nto hang you again. We are your friends, and we have come to save you.\nFollow us.\"\n\n\"Is it true?\" she exclaimed in dismay.\n\n\"Yes, perfectly true. Come quickly!\"\n\n\"I am willing,\" she stammered. \"But why does not your friend speak?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Gringoire, \"'tis because his father and mother were fantastic\npeople who made him of a taciturn temperament.\"\n\nShe was obliged to content herself with this explanation. Gringoire took\nher by the hand; his companion picked up the lantern and walked on in\nfront. Fear stunned the young girl. She allowed herself to be led away.\nThe goat followed them, frisking, so joyous at seeing Gringoire again\nthat it made him stumble every moment by thrusting its horns between his\nlegs.\n\n\"Such is life,\" said the philosopher, every time that he came\nnear falling down; \"'tis often our best friends who cause us to be\noverthrown.\"\n\nThey rapidly descended the staircase of the towers, crossed the church,\nfull of shadows and solitude, and all reverberating with uproar, which\nformed a frightful contrast, and emerged into the courtyard of the\ncloister by the red door. The cloister was deserted; the canons had\nfled to the bishop's palace in order to pray together; the courtyard\nwas empty, a few frightened lackeys were crouching in dark corners. They\ndirected their steps towards the door which opened from this court upon\nthe Terrain. The man in black opened it with a key which he had about\nhim. Our readers are aware that the Terrain was a tongue of land\nenclosed by walls on the side of the City and belonging to the chapter\nof Notre-Dame, which terminated the island on the east, behind the\nchurch. They found this enclosure perfectly deserted. There was here\nless tumult in the air. The roar of the outcasts' assault reached them\nmore confusedly and less clamorously. The fresh breeze which follows the\ncurrent of a stream, rustled the leaves of the only tree planted on the\npoint of the Terrain, with a noise that was already perceptible. But\nthey were still very close to danger. The nearest edifices to them were\nthe bishop's palace and the church. It was plainly evident that there\nwas great internal commotion in the bishop's palace. Its shadowy mass\nwas all furrowed with lights which flitted from window to window; as,\nwhen one has just burned paper, there remains a sombre edifice of ashes\nin which bright sparks run a thousand eccentric courses. Beside them,\nthe enormous towers of Notre-Dame, thus viewed from behind, with the\nlong nave above which they rise cut out in black against the red and\nvast light which filled the Parvis, resembled two gigantic andirons of\nsome cyclopean fire-grate.\n\nWhat was to be seen of Paris on all sides wavered before the eye in\na gloom mingled with light. Rembrandt has such backgrounds to his\npictures.\n\nThe man with the lantern walked straight to the point of the Terrain.\nThere, at the very brink of the water, stood the wormeaten remains of a\nfence of posts latticed with laths, whereon a low vine spread out a\nfew thin branches like the fingers of an outspread hand. Behind, in the\nshadow cast by this trellis, a little boat lay concealed. The man made\na sign to Gringoire and his companion to enter. The goat followed them.\nThe man was the last to step in. Then he cut the boat's moorings, pushed\nit from the shore with a long boat-hook, and, seizing two oars, seated\nhimself in the bow, rowing with all his might towards midstream. The\nSeine is very rapid at this point, and he had a good deal of trouble in\nleaving the point of the island.\n\nGringoire's first care on entering the boat was to place the goat on\nhis knees. He took a position in the stern; and the young girl, whom the\nstranger inspired with an indefinable uneasiness, seated herself close\nto the poet.\n\nWhen our philosopher felt the boat sway, he clapped his hands and kissed\nDjali between the horns.\n\n\"Oh!\" said he, \"now we are safe, all four of us.\"\n\nHe added with the air of a profound thinker, \"One is indebted\nsometimes to fortune, sometimes to ruse, for the happy issue of great\nenterprises.\"\n\nThe boat made its way slowly towards the right shore. The young girl\nwatched the unknown man with secret terror. He had carefully turned off\nthe light of his dark lantern. A glimpse could be caught of him in the\nobscurity, in the bow of the boat, like a spectre. His cowl, which was\nstill lowered, formed a sort of mask; and every time that he spread his\narms, upon which hung large black sleeves, as he rowed, one would have\nsaid they were two huge bat's wings. Moreover, he had not yet uttered a\nword or breathed a syllable. No other noise was heard in the boat than\nthe splashing of the oars, mingled with the rippling of the water along\nher sides.\n\n\"On my soul!\" exclaimed Gringoire suddenly, \"we are as cheerful and\njoyous as young owls! We preserve the silence of Pythagoreans or fishes!\n_Pasque-Dieu_! my friends, I should greatly like to have some one speak\nto me. The human voice is music to the human ear. 'Tis not I who\nsay that, but Didymus of Alexandria, and they are illustrious words.\nAssuredly, Didymus of Alexandria is no mediocre philosopher.--One word,\nmy lovely child! say but one word to me, I entreat you. By the way, you\nhad a droll and peculiar little pout; do you still make it? Do you\nknow, my dear, that parliament hath full jurisdiction over all places of\nasylum, and that you were running a great risk in your little chamber at\nNotre-Dame? Alas! the little bird trochylus maketh its nest in the jaws\nof the crocodile.--Master, here is the moon re-appearing. If only\nthey do not perceive us. We are doing a laudable thing in saving\nmademoiselle, and yet we should be hung by order of the king if we were\ncaught. Alas! human actions are taken by two handles. That is branded\nwith disgrace in one which is crowned in another. He admires Cicero who\nblames Catiline. Is it not so, master? What say you to this\nphilosophy? I possess philosophy by instinct, by nature, _ut apes\ngeometriam_.--Come! no one answers me. What unpleasant moods you two are\nin! I must do all the talking alone. That is what we call a monologue\nin tragedy.--_Pasque-Dieu_! I must inform you that I have just seen\nthe king, Louis XI., and that I have caught this oath from\nhim,--_Pasque-Dieu_! They are still making a hearty howl in the\ncity.--'Tis a villanous, malicious old king. He is all swathed in furs.\nHe still owes me the money for my epithalamium, and he came within a\nnick of hanging me this evening, which would have been very inconvenient\nto me.--He is niggardly towards men of merit. He ought to read the four\nbooks of Salvien of Cologne, _Adversits Avaritiam_. In truth! 'Tis a\npaltry king in his ways with men of letters, and one who commits very\nbarbarous cruelties. He is a sponge, to soak money raised from the\npeople. His saving is like the spleen which swelleth with the leanness\nof all the other members. Hence complaints against the hardness of the\ntimes become murmurs against the prince. Under this gentle and pious\nsire, the gallows crack with the hung, the blocks rot with blood, the\nprisons burst like over full bellies. This king hath one hand which\ngrasps, and one which hangs. He is the procurator of Dame Tax and\nMonsieur Gibbet. The great are despoiled of their dignities, and\nthe little incessantly overwhelmed with fresh oppressions. He is an\nexorbitant prince. I love not this monarch. And you, master?\"\n\nThe man in black let the garrulous poet chatter on. He continued to\nstruggle against the violent and narrow current, which separates the\nprow of the City and the stem of the island of Notre-Dame, which we call\nto-day the Isle St. Louis.\n\n\"By the way, master!\" continued Gringoire suddenly. \"At the moment\nwhen we arrived on the Parvis, through the enraged outcasts, did your\nreverence observe that poor little devil whose skull your deaf man was\njust cracking on the railing of the gallery of the kings? I am near\nsighted and I could not recognize him. Do you know who he could be?\"\n\nThe stranger answered not a word. But he suddenly ceased rowing,\nhis arms fell as though broken, his head sank on his breast, and la\nEsmeralda heard him sigh convulsively. She shuddered. She had heard such\nsighs before.\n\nThe boat, abandoned to itself, floated for several minutes with the\nstream. But the man in black finally recovered himself, seized the oars\nonce more and began to row against the current. He doubled the point of\nthe Isle of Notre Dame, and made for the landing-place of the Port an\nFoin.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Gringoire, \"yonder is the Barbeau mansion.--Stay, master,\nlook: that group of black roofs which make such singular angles yonder,\nabove that heap of black, fibrous grimy, dirty clouds, where the moon is\ncompletely crushed and spread out like the yolk of an egg whose shell\nis broken.--'Tis a fine mansion. There is a chapel crowned with a small\nvault full of very well carved enrichments. Above, you can see the bell\ntower, very delicately pierced. There is also a pleasant garden, which\nconsists of a pond, an aviary, an echo, a mall, a labyrinth, a house\nfor wild beasts, and a quantity of leafy alleys very agreeable to Venus.\nThere is also a rascal of a tree which is called 'the lewd,' because it\nfavored the pleasures of a famous princess and a constable of France,\nwho was a gallant and a wit.--Alas! we poor philosophers are to a\nconstable as a plot of cabbages or a radish bed to the garden of the\nLouvre. What matters it, after all? human life, for the great as well\nas for us, is a mixture of good and evil. Pain is always by the side\nof joy, the spondee by the dactyl.--Master, I must relate to you the\nhistory of the Barbeau mansion. It ends in tragic fashion. It was in\n1319, in the reign of Philippe V., the longest reign of the kings of\nFrance. The moral of the story is that the temptations of the flesh are\npernicious and malignant. Let us not rest our glance too long on our\nneighbor's wife, however gratified our senses may be by her beauty.\nFornication is a very libertine thought. Adultery is a prying into the\npleasures of others--Oh\u00c3\u00a9! the noise yonder is redoubling!\"\n\nThe tumult around Notre-Dame was, in fact, increasing. They listened.\nCries of victory were heard with tolerable distinctness. All at once, a\nhundred torches, the light of which glittered upon the helmets of men\nat arms, spread over the church at all heights, on the towers, on the\ngalleries, on the flying buttresses. These torches seemed to be in\nsearch of something; and soon distant clamors reached the fugitives\ndistinctly:--\"The gypsy! the sorceress! death to the gypsy!\"\n\nThe unhappy girl dropped her head upon her hands, and the unknown began\nto row furiously towards the shore. Meanwhile our philosopher reflected.\nHe clasped the goat in his arms, and gently drew away from the gypsy,\nwho pressed closer and closer to him, as though to the only asylum which\nremained to her.\n\nIt is certain that Gringoire was enduring cruel perplexity. He was\nthinking that the goat also, \"according to existing law,\" would be hung\nif recaptured; which would be a great pity, poor Djali! that he had thus\ntwo condemned creatures attached to him; that his companion asked no\nbetter than to take charge of the gypsy. A violent combat began between\nhis thoughts, in which, like the Jupiter of the Iliad, he weighed in\nturn the gypsy and the goat; and he looked at them alternately with eyes\nmoist with tears, saying between his teeth:\n\n\"But I cannot save you both!\"\n\nA shock informed them that the boat had reached the land at last. The\nuproar still filled the city. The unknown rose, approached the gypsy,\nand endeavored to take her arm to assist her to alight. She repulsed him\nand clung to the sleeve of Gringoire, who, in his turn, absorbed in the\ngoat, almost repulsed her. Then she sprang alone from the boat. She was\nso troubled that she did not know what she did or whither she was going.\nThus she remained for a moment, stunned, watching the water flow past;\nwhen she gradually returned to her senses, she found herself alone\non the wharf with the unknown. It appears that Gringoire had taken\nadvantage of the moment of debarcation to slip away with the goat into\nthe block of houses of the Rue Grenier-sur-l'Eau.\n\nThe poor gypsy shivered when she beheld herself alone with this man. She\ntried to speak, to cry out, to call Gringoire; her tongue was dumb\nin her mouth, and no sound left her lips. All at once she felt\nthe stranger's hand on hers. It was a strong, cold hand. Her teeth\nchattered, she turned paler than the ray of moonlight which illuminated\nher. The man spoke not a word. He began to ascend towards the Place de\nGr\u00c3\u00a8ve, holding her by the hand.\n\nAt that moment, she had a vague feeling that destiny is an irresistible\nforce. She had no more resistance left in her, she allowed herself to be\ndragged along, running while he walked. At this spot the quay ascended.\nBut it seemed to her as though she were descending a slope.\n\nShe gazed about her on all sides. Not a single passer-by. The quay was\nabsolutely deserted. She heard no sound, she felt no people moving save\nin the tumultuous and glowing city, from which she was separated only by\nan arm of the Seine, and whence her name reached her, mingled with cries\nof \"Death!\" The rest of Paris was spread around her in great blocks of\nshadows.\n\nMeanwhile, the stranger continued to drag her along with the same\nsilence and the same rapidity. She had no recollection of any of the\nplaces where she was walking. As she passed before a lighted window, she\nmade an effort, drew up suddenly, and cried out, \"Help!\"\n\nThe bourgeois who was standing at the window opened it, appeared there\nin his shirt with his lamp, stared at the quay with a stupid air,\nuttered some words which she did not understand, and closed his shutter\nagain. It was her last gleam of hope extinguished.\n\nThe man in black did not utter a syllable; he held her firmly, and set\nout again at a quicker pace. She no longer resisted, but followed him,\ncompletely broken.\n\nFrom time to time she called together a little strength, and said, in a\nvoice broken by the unevenness of the pavement and the breathlessness of\ntheir flight, \"Who are you? Who are you?\" He made no reply.\n\nThey arrived thus, still keeping along the quay, at a tolerably spacious\nsquare. It was the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. In the middle, a sort of black, erect cross\nwas visible; it was the gallows. She recognized all this, and saw where\nshe was.\n\nThe man halted, turned towards her and raised his cowl.\n\n\"Oh!\" she stammered, almost petrified, \"I knew well that it was he\nagain!\"\n\nIt was the priest. He looked like the ghost of himself; that is an\neffect of the moonlight, it seems as though one beheld only the spectres\nof things in that light.\n\n\"Listen!\" he said to her; and she shuddered at the sound of that fatal\nvoice which she had not heard for a long time. He continued speaking\nwith those brief and panting jerks, which betoken deep internal\nconvulsions. \"Listen! we are here. I am going to speak to you. This is\nthe Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. This is an extreme point. Destiny gives us to one another. I\nam going to decide as to your life; you will decide as to my soul. Here\nis a place, here is a night beyond which one sees nothing. Then listen\nto me. I am going to tell you...In the first place, speak not to me\nof your Phoebus. (As he spoke thus he paced to and fro, like a man who\ncannot remain in one place, and dragged her after him.) Do not speak to\nme of him. Do you see? If you utter that name, I know not what I shall\ndo, but it will be terrible.\"\n\nThen, like a body which recovers its centre of gravity, he became\nmotionless once more, but his words betrayed no less agitation. His\nvoice grew lower and lower.\n\n\"Do not turn your head aside thus. Listen to me. It is a serious matter.\nIn the first place, here is what has happened.--All this will not be\nlaughed at. I swear it to you.--What was I saying? Remind me! Oh!--There\nis a decree of Parliament which gives you back to the scaffold. I have\njust rescued you from their hands. But they are pursuing you. Look!\"\n\nHe extended his arm toward the City. The search seemed, in fact, to\nbe still in progress there. The uproar drew nearer; the tower of the\nlieutenant's house, situated opposite the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, was full of clamors\nand light, and soldiers could be seen running on the opposite quay with\ntorches and these cries, \"The gypsy! Where is the gypsy! Death! Death!\"\n\n\"You see that they are in pursuit of you, and that I am not lying to\nyou. I love you.--Do not open your mouth; refrain from speaking to me\nrather, if it be only to tell me that you hate me. I have made up my\nmind not to hear that again.--I have just saved you.--Let me finish\nfirst. I can save you wholly. I have prepared everything. It is yours at\nwill. If you wish, I can do it.\"\n\nHe broke off violently. \"No, that is not what I should say!\"\n\nAs he went with hurried step and made her hurry also, for he did not\nrelease her, he walked straight to the gallows, and pointed to it with\nhis finger,--\n\n\"Choose between us two,\" he said, coldly.\n\nShe tore herself from his hands and fell at the foot of the gibbet,\nembracing that funereal support, then she half turned her beautiful\nhead, and looked at the priest over her shoulder. One would have said\nthat she was a Holy Virgin at the foot of the cross. The priest remained\nmotionless, his finger still raised toward the gibbet, preserving his\nattitude like a statue. At length the gypsy said to him,--\n\n\"It causes me less horror than you do.\"\n\nThen he allowed his arm to sink slowly, and gazed at the pavement in\nprofound dejection.\n\n\"If these stones could speak,\" he murmured, \"yes, they would say that a\n* very unhappy man stands here.\"\n\nHe went on. The young girl, kneeling before the gallows, enveloped in\nher long flowing hair, let him speak on without interruption. He now had\na gentle and plaintive accent which contrasted sadly with the haughty\nharshness of his features.\n\n\"I love you. Oh! how true that is! So nothing comes of that fire which\nburns my heart! Alas! young girl, night and day--yes, night and day I\ntell you,--it is torture. Oh! I suffer too much, my poor child. 'Tis a\nthing deserving of compassion, I assure you. You see that I speak gently\nto you. I really wish that you should no longer cherish this horror\nof me.--After all, if a man loves a woman, 'tis not his fault!--Oh, my\nGod!--What! So you will never pardon me? You will always hate me? All is\nover then. It is that which renders me evil, do you see? and horrible\nto myself.--You will not even look at me! You are thinking of something\nelse, perchance, while I stand here and talk to you, shuddering on the\nbrink of eternity for both of us! Above all things, do not speak to me\nof the officer!--I would cast myself at your knees, I would kiss not\nyour feet, but the earth which is under your feet; I would sob like\na child, I would tear from my breast not words, but my very heart and\nvitals, to tell you that I love you;--all would be useless, all!--And\nyet you have nothing in your heart but what is tender and merciful.\nYou are radiant with the most beautiful mildness; you are wholly sweet,\ngood, pitiful, and charming. Alas! You cherish no ill will for any one\nbut me alone! Oh! what a fatality!\"\n\nHe hid his face in his hands. The young girl heard him weeping. It was\nfor the first time. Thus erect and shaken by sobs, he was more\nmiserable and more suppliant than when on his knees. He wept thus for a\nconsiderable time.\n\n\"Come!\" he said, these first tears passed, \"I have no more words. I had,\nhowever, thought well as to what you would say. Now I tremble and shiver\nand break down at the decisive moment, I feel conscious of something\nsupreme enveloping us, and I stammer. Oh! I shall fall upon the pavement\nif you do not take pity on me, pity on yourself. Do not condemn us both.\nIf you only knew how much I love you! What a heart is mine! Oh! what\ndesertion of all virtue! What desperate abandonment of myself! A doctor,\nI mock at science; a gentleman, I tarnish my own name; a priest, I make\nof the missal a pillow of sensuality, I spit in the face of my God! all\nthis for thee, enchantress! to be more worthy of thy hell! And you will\nnot have the apostate! Oh! let me tell you all! more still, something\nmore horrible, oh! Yet more horrible!....\"\n\nAs he uttered these last words, his air became utterly distracted. He\nwas silent for a moment, and resumed, as though speaking to himself, and\nin a strong voice,--\n\n\"Cain, what hast thou done with thy brother?\"\n\nThere was another silence, and he went on--\n\n\"What have I done with him, Lord? I received him, I reared him, I\nnourished him, I loved him, I idolized him, and I have slain him! Yes,\nLord, they have just dashed his head before my eyes on the stone of\nthine house, and it is because of me, because of this woman, because of\nher.\"\n\nHis eye was wild. His voice grew ever weaker; he repeated many times,\nyet, mechanically, at tolerably long intervals, like a bell prolonging\nits last vibration: \"Because of her.--Because of her.\"\n\nThen his tongue no longer articulated any perceptible sound; but\nhis lips still moved. All at once he sank together, like something\ncrumbling, and lay motionless on the earth, with his head on his knees.\n\nA touch from the young girl, as she drew her foot from under him,\nbrought him to himself. He passed his hand slowly over his hollow\ncheeks, and gazed for several moments at his fingers, which were wet,\n\"What!\" he murmured, \"I have wept!\"\n\nAnd turning suddenly to the gypsy with unspeakable anguish,--\n\n\"Alas! you have looked coldly on at my tears! Child, do you know that\nthose tears are of lava? Is it indeed true? Nothing touches when it\ncomes from the man whom one does not love. If you were to see me die,\nyou would laugh. Oh! I do not wish to see you die! One word! A single\nword of pardon! Say not that you love me, say only that you will do it;\nthat will suffice; I will save you. If not--oh! the hour is passing. I\nentreat you by all that is sacred, do not wait until I shall have turned\nto stone again, like that gibbet which also claims you! Reflect that\nI hold the destinies of both of us in my hand, that I am mad,--it is\nterrible,--that I may let all go to destruction, and that there is\nbeneath us a bottomless abyss, unhappy girl, whither my fall will follow\nyours to all eternity! One word of kindness! Say one word! only one\nword!\"\n\nShe opened her mouth to answer him. He flung himself on his knees to\nreceive with adoration the word, possibly a tender one, which was on the\npoint of issuing from her lips. She said to him, \"You are an assassin!\"\n\nThe priest clasped her in his arms with fury, and began to laugh with an\nabominable laugh.\n\n\"Well, yes, an assassin!\" he said, \"and I will have you. You will not\nhave me for your slave, you shall have me for your master. I will have\nyou! I have a den, whither I will drag you. You will follow me, you\nwill be obliged to follow me, or I will deliver you up! You must die, my\nbeauty, or be mine! belong to the priest! belong to the apostate! belong\nto the assassin! this very night, do you hear? Come! joy; kiss me, mad\ngirl! The tomb or my bed!\"\n\nHis eyes sparkled with impurity and rage. His lewd lips reddened the\nyoung girl's neck. She struggled in his arms. He covered her with\nfurious kisses.\n\n\"Do not bite me, monster!\" she cried. \"Oh! the foul, odious monk! leave\nme! I will tear out thy ugly gray hair and fling it in thy face by the\nhandful!\"\n\nHe reddened, turned pale, then released her and gazed at her with a\ngloomy air. She thought herself victorious, and continued,--\n\n\"I tell you that I belong to my Phoebus, that 'tis Phoebus whom I love,\nthat 'tis Phoebus who is handsome! you are old, priest! you are ugly!\nBegone!\"\n\nHe gave vent to a horrible cry, like the wretch to whom a hot iron is\napplied. \"Die, then!\" he said, gnashing his teeth. She saw his terrible\nlook and tried to fly. He caught her once more, he shook her, he flung\nher on the ground, and walked with rapid strides towards the corner\nof the Tour-Roland, dragging her after him along the pavement by her\nbeautiful hands.\n\nOn arriving there, he turned to her,--\n\n\"For the last time, will you be mine?\"\n\nShe replied with emphasis,--\n\n\"No!\"\n\nThen he cried in a loud voice,--\n\n\"Gudule! Gudule! here is the gypsy! take your vengeance!\"\n\nThe young girl felt herself seized suddenly by the elbow. She looked.\nA fleshless arm was stretched from an opening in the wall, and held her\nlike a hand of iron.\n\n\"Hold her well,\" said the priest; \"'tis the gypsy escaped. Release her\nnot. I will go in search of the sergeants. You shall see her hanged.\"\n\nA guttural laugh replied from the interior of the wall to these bloody\nwords--\"Hah! hah! hah!\"--The gypsy watched the priest retire in\nthe direction of the Pont Notre-Dame. A cavalcade was heard in that\ndirection.\n\nThe young girl had recognized the spiteful recluse. Panting with terror,\nshe tried to disengage herself. She writhed, she made many starts of\nagony and despair, but the other held her with incredible strength. The\nlean and bony fingers which bruised her, clenched on her flesh and met\naround it. One would have said that this hand was riveted to her arm. It\nwas more than a chain, more than a fetter, more than a ring of iron, it\nwas a living pair of pincers endowed with intelligence, which emerged\nfrom the wall.\n\nShe fell back against the wall exhausted, and then the fear of death\ntook possession of her. She thought of the beauty of life, of youth, of\nthe view of heaven, the aspects of nature, of her love for Phoebus, of\nall that was vanishing and all that was approaching, of the priest who\nwas denouncing her, of the headsman who was to come, of the gallows\nwhich was there. Then she felt terror mount to the very roots of her\nhair and she heard the mocking laugh of the recluse, saying to her in a\nvery low tone: \"Hah! hah! hah! you are going to be hanged!\"\n\nShe turned a dying look towards the window, and she beheld the fierce\nface of the sacked nun through the bars.\n\n\"What have I done to you?\" she said, almost lifeless.\n\nThe recluse did not reply, but began to mumble with a singsong\nirritated, mocking intonation: \"Daughter of Egypt! daughter of Egypt!\ndaughter of Egypt!\"\n\nThe unhappy Esmeralda dropped her head beneath her flowing hair,\ncomprehending that it was no human being she had to deal with.\n\nAll at once the recluse exclaimed, as though the gypsy's question had\ntaken all this time to reach her brain,--\"'What have you done to me?'\nyou say! Ah! what have you done to me, gypsy! Well! listen.--I had a\nchild! you see! I had a child! a child, I tell you!--a pretty little\ngirl!--my Agnes!\" she went on wildly, kissing something in the\ndark.--\"Well! do you see, daughter of Egypt? they took my child from me;\nthey stole my child; they ate my child. That is what you have done to\nme.\"\n\nThe young girl replied like a lamb,--\n\n\"Alas! perchance I was not born then!\"\n\n\"Oh! yes!\" returned the recluse, \"you must have been born. You were\namong them. She would be the same age as you! so!--I have been here\nfifteen years; fifteen years have I suffered; fifteen years have I\nprayed; fifteen years have I beat my head against these four walls--I\ntell you that 'twas the gypsies who stole her from me, do you hear that?\nand who ate her with their teeth.--Have you a heart? imagine a child\nplaying, a child sucking; a child sleeping. It is so innocent a\nthing!--Well! that, that is what they took from me, what they killed.\nThe good God knows it well! To-day, it is my turn; I am going to eat the\ngypsy.--Oh! I would bite you well, if the bars did not prevent me! My\nhead is too large!--Poor little one! while she was asleep! And if\nthey woke her up when they took her, in vain she might cry; I was not\nthere!--Ah! gypsy mothers, you devoured my child! come see your own.\"\n\nThen she began to laugh or to gnash her teeth, for the two things\nresembled each other in that furious face. The day was beginning to\ndawn. An ashy gleam dimly lighted this scene, and the gallows grew more\nand more distinct in the square. On the other side, in the direction of\nthe bridge of Notre-Dame, the poor condemned girl fancied that she heard\nthe sound of cavalry approaching.\n\n\"Madam,\" she cried, clasping her hands and falling on her knees,\ndishevelled, distracted, mad with fright; \"madam! have pity! They are\ncoming. I have done nothing to you. Would you wish to see me die in this\nhorrible fashion before your very eyes? You are pitiful, I am sure. It\nis too frightful. Let me make my escape. Release me! Mercy. I do not\nwish to die like that!\"\n\n\"Give me back my child!\" said the recluse.\n\n\"Mercy! Mercy!\"\n\n\"Give me back my child!\"\n\n\"Release me, in the name of heaven!\"\n\n\"Give me back my child!\"\n\nAgain the young girl fell; exhausted, broken, and having already the\nglassy eye of a person in the grave.\n\n\"Alas!\" she faltered, \"you seek your child, I seek my parents.\"\n\n\"Give me back my little Agnes!\" pursued Gudule. \"You do not know where\nshe is? Then die!--I will tell you. I was a woman of the town, I had a\nchild, they took my child. It was the gypsies. You see plainly that you\nmust die. When your mother, the gypsy, comes to reclaim you, I shall say\nto her: 'Mother, look at that gibbet!--Or, give me back my child. Do you\nknow where she is, my little daughter? Stay! I will show you. Here is\nher shoe, all that is left me of her. Do you know where its mate is? If\nyou know, tell me, and if it is only at the other end of the world, I\nwill crawl to it on my knees.\"\n\nAs she spoke thus, with her other arm extended through the window,\nshe showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe. It was already light\nenough to distinguish its shape and its colors.\n\n\"Let me see that shoe,\" said the gypsy, quivering. \"God! God!\"\n\nAnd at the same time, with her hand which was at liberty, she quickly\nopened the little bag ornamented with green glass, which she wore about\nher neck.\n\n\"Go on, go on!\" grumbled Gudule, \"search your demon's amulet!\"\n\nAll at once, she stopped short, trembled in every limb, and cried in a\nvoice which proceeded from the very depths of her being: \"My daughter!\"\n\nThe gypsy had just drawn from the bag a little shoe absolutely similar\nto the other. To this little shoe was attached a parchment on which was\ninscribed this charm,--\n\n\n         _Quand le parell retrouveras\n         Ta mere te tendras les bras_.*\n\n\n     * When thou shalt find its mate, thy mother will stretch out\nher arms to thee.\n\n\nQuicker than a flash of lightning, the recluse had laid the two shoes\ntogether, had read the parchment and had put close to the bars of the\nwindow her face beaming with celestial joy as she cried,--\n\n\"My daughter! my daughter!\"\n\n\"My mother!\" said the gypsy.\n\nHere we are unequal to the task of depicting the scene. The wall and the\niron bars were between them. \"Oh! the wall!\" cried the recluse. \"Oh! to\nsee her and not to embrace her! Your hand! your hand!\"\n\nThe young girl passed her arm through the opening; the recluse threw\nherself on that hand, pressed her lips to it and there remained, buried\nin that kiss, giving no other sign of life than a sob which heaved her\nbreast from time to time. In the meanwhile, she wept in torrents, in\nsilence, in the dark, like a rain at night. The poor mother poured out\nin floods upon that adored hand the dark and deep well of tears, which\nlay within her, and into which her grief had filtered, drop by drop, for\nfifteen years.\n\nAll at once she rose, flung aside her long gray hair from her brow, and\nwithout uttering a word, began to shake the bars of her cage cell, with\nboth hands, more furiously than a lioness. The bars held firm. Then she\nwent to seek in the corner of her cell a huge paving stone, which served\nher as a pillow, and launched it against them with such violence that\none of the bars broke, emitting thousands of sparks. A second blow\ncompletely shattered the old iron cross which barricaded the window.\nThen with her two hands, she finished breaking and removing the rusted\nstumps of the bars. There are moments when woman's hands possess\nsuperhuman strength.\n\nA passage broken, less than a minute was required for her to seize her\ndaughter by the middle of her body, and draw her into her cell. \"Come\nlet me draw you out of the abyss,\" she murmured.\n\nWhen her daughter was inside the cell, she laid her gently on the\nground, then raised her up again, and bearing her in her arms as though\nshe were still only her little Agnes, she walked to and fro in her\nlittle room, intoxicated, frantic, joyous, crying out, singing, kissing\nher daughter, talking to her, bursting into laughter, melting into\ntears, all at once and with vehemence.\n\n\"My daughter! my daughter!\" she said. \"I have my daughter! here she is!\nThe good God has given her back to me! Ha you! come all of you! Is there\nany one there to see that I have my daughter? Lord Jesus, how beautiful\nshe is! You have made me wait fifteen years, my good God, but it was in\norder to give her back to me beautiful.--Then the gypsies did not eat\nher! Who said so? My little daughter! my little daughter! Kiss me. Those\ngood gypsies! I love the gypsies!--It is really you! That was what made\nmy heart leap every time that you passed by. And I took that for hatred!\nForgive me, my Agnes, forgive me. You thought me very malicious, did\nyou not? I love you. Have you still the little mark on your neck? Let\nus see. She still has it. Oh! you are beautiful! It was I who gave you\nthose big eyes, mademoiselle. Kiss me. I love you. It is nothing to me\nthat other mothers have children; I scorn them now. They have only to\ncome and see. Here is mine. See her neck, her eyes, her hair, her hands.\nFind me anything as beautiful as that! Oh! I promise you she will have\nlovers, that she will! I have wept for fifteen years. All my beauty has\ndeparted and has fallen to her. Kiss me.\"\n\nShe addressed to her a thousand other extravagant remarks, whose accent\nconstituted their sole beauty, disarranged the poor girl's garments even\nto the point of making her blush, smoothed her silky hair with her hand,\nkissed her foot, her knee, her brow, her eyes, was in raptures over\neverything. The young girl let her have her way, repeating at intervals\nand very low and with infinite tenderness, \"My mother!\"\n\n\"Do you see, my little girl,\" resumed the recluse, interspersing her\nwords with kisses, \"I shall love you dearly? We will go away from here.\nWe are going to be very happy. I have inherited something in Reims, in\nour country. You know Reims? Ah! no, you do not know it; you were too\nsmall! If you only knew how pretty you were at the age of four months!\nTiny feet that people came even from Epernay, which is seven leagues\naway, to see! We shall have a field, a house. I will put you to sleep in\nmy bed. My God! my God! who would believe this? I have my daughter!\"\n\n\"Oh, my mother!\" said the young girl, at length finding strength to\nspeak in her emotion, \"the gypsy woman told me so. There was a good\ngypsy of our band who died last year, and who always cared for me like\na nurse. It was she who placed this little bag about my neck. She always\nsaid to me: 'Little one, guard this jewel well! 'Tis a treasure. It will\ncause thee to find thy mother once again. Thou wearest thy mother about\nthy neck.'--The gypsy predicted it!\"\n\nThe sacked nun again pressed her daughter in her arms.\n\n\"Come, let me kiss you! You say that prettily. When we are in the\ncountry, we will place these little shoes on an infant Jesus in the\nchurch. We certainly owe that to the good, holy Virgin. What a pretty\nvoice you have! When you spoke to me just now, it was music! Ah! my Lord\nGod! I have found my child again! But is this story credible? Nothing\nwill kill one--or I should have died of joy.\"\n\nAnd then she began to clap her hands again and to laugh and to cry out:\n\"We are going to be so happy!\"\n\nAt that moment, the cell resounded with the clang of arms and a\ngalloping of horses which seemed to be coming from the Pont Notre-Dame,\namid advancing farther and farther along the quay. The gypsy threw\nherself with anguish into the arms of the sacked nun.\n\n\"Save me! save me! mother! they are coming!\"\n\n\"Oh, heaven! what are you saying? I had forgotten! They are in pursuit\nof you! What have you done?\"\n\n\"I know not,\" replied the unhappy child; \"but I am condemned to die.\"\n\n\"To die!\" said Gudule, staggering as though struck by lightning; \"to\ndie!\" she repeated slowly, gazing at her daughter with staring eyes.\n\n\"Yes, mother,\" replied the frightened young girl, \"they want to kill me.\nThey are coming to seize me. That gallows is for me! Save me! save me!\nThey are coming! Save me!\"\n\nThe recluse remained for several moments motionless and petrified, then\nshe moved her head in sign of doubt, and suddenly giving vent to a burst\nof laughter, but with that terrible laugh which had come back to her,--\n\n\"Ho! ho! no! 'tis a dream of which you are telling me. Ah, yes! I lost\nher, that lasted fifteen years, and then I found her again, and that\nlasted a minute! And they would take her from me again! And now, when\nshe is beautiful, when she is grown up, when she speaks to me, when she\nloves me; it is now that they would come to devour her, before my very\neyes, and I her mother! Oh! no! these things are not possible. The good\nGod does not permit such things as that.\"\n\nHere the cavalcade appeared to halt, and a voice was heard to say in the\ndistance,--\n\n\"This way, Messire Tristan! The priest says that we shall find her at\nthe Rat-Hole.\" The noise of the horses began again.\n\nThe recluse sprang to her feet with a shriek of despair. \"Fly! fly! my\nchild! All comes back to me. You are right. It is your death! Horror!\nMaledictions! Fly!\"\n\nShe thrust her head through the window, and withdrew it again hastily.\n\n\"Remain,\" she said, in a low, curt, and lugubrious tone, as she pressed\nthe hand of the gypsy, who was more dead than alive. \"Remain! Do not\nbreathe! There are soldiers everywhere. You cannot get out. It is too\nlight.\"\n\nHer eyes were dry and burning. She remained silent for a moment; but she\npaced the cell hurriedly, and halted now and then to pluck out handfuls\nof her gray hairs, which she afterwards tore with her teeth.\n\nSuddenly she said: \"They draw near. I will speak with them. Hide\nyourself in this corner. They will not see you. I will tell them that\nyou have made your escape. That I released you, i' faith!\"\n\nShe set her daughter (down for she was still carrying her), in one\ncorner of the cell which was not visible from without. She made her\ncrouch down, arranged her carefully so that neither foot nor hand\nprojected from the shadow, untied her black hair which she spread over\nher white robe to conceal it, placed in front of her her jug and her\npaving stone, the only articles of furniture which she possessed,\nimagining that this jug and stone would hide her. And when this was\nfinished she became more tranquil, and knelt down to pray. The day,\nwhich was only dawning, still left many shadows in the Rat-Hole.\n\nAt that moment, the voice of the priest, that infernal voice, passed\nvery close to the cell, crying,--\n\n\"This way, Captain Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers.\"\n\nAt that name, at that voice, la Esmeralda, crouching in her corner, made\na movement.\n\n\"Do not stir!\" said Gudule.\n\nShe had barely finished when a tumult of men, swords, and horses halted\naround the cell. The mother rose quickly and went to post herself before\nher window, in order to stop it up. She beheld a large troop of armed\nmen, both horse and foot, drawn up on the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\n\nThe commander dismounted, and came toward her.\n\n\"Old woman!\" said this man, who had an atrocious face, \"we are in search\nof a witch to hang her; we were told that you had her.\"\n\nThe poor mother assumed as indifferent an air as she could, and\nreplied,--\n\n\"I know not what you mean.\"\n\nThe other resumed, \"_T\u00c3\u00aate Dieu_! What was it that frightened archdeacon\nsaid? Where is he?\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said a soldier, \"he has disappeared.\"\n\n\"Come, now, old madwoman,\" began the commander again, \"do not lie. A\nsorceress was given in charge to you. What have you done with her?\"\n\nThe recluse did not wish to deny all, for fear of awakening suspicion,\nand replied in a sincere and surly tone,--\n\n\"If you are speaking of a big young girl who was put into my hands a\nwhile ago, I will tell you that she bit me, and that I released her.\nThere! Leave me in peace.\"\n\nThe commander made a grimace of disappointment. \"Don't lie to me, old\nspectre!\" said he. \"My name is Tristan l'Hermite, and I am the king's\ngossip. Tristan the Hermit, do you hear?\" He added, as he glanced at the\nPlace de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve around him, \"'Tis a name which has an echo here.\"\n\n\"You might be Satan the Hermit,\" replied Gudule, who was regaining hope,\n\"but I should have nothing else to say to you, and I should never be\nafraid of you.\"\n\n\"_T\u00c3\u00aate-Dieu_,\" said Tristan, \"here is a crone! Ah! So the witch girl\nhath fled! And in which direction did she go?\" Gudule replied in a\ncareless tone,--\n\n\"Through the Rue du Mouton, I believe.\"\n\nTristan turned his head and made a sign to his troop to prepare to set\nout on the march again. The recluse breathed freely once more.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" suddenly said an archer, \"ask the old elf why the bars of\nher window are broken in this manner.\"\n\nThis question brought anguish again to the heart of the miserable\nmother. Nevertheless, she did not lose all presence of mind.\n\n\"They have always been thus,\" she stammered.\n\n\"Bah!\" retorted the archer, \"only yesterday they still formed a fine\nblack cross, which inspired devotion.\"\n\nTristan east a sidelong glance at the recluse.\n\n\"I think the old dame is getting confused!\"\n\nThe unfortunate woman felt that all depended on her self-possession,\nand, although with death in her soul, she began to grin. Mothers possess\nsuch strength.\n\n\"Bah!\" said she, \"the man is drunk. 'Tis more than a year since the tail\nof a stone cart dashed against my window and broke in the grating. And\nhow I cursed the carter, too.\"\n\n\"'Tis true,\" said another archer, \"I was there.\"\n\nAlways and everywhere people are to be found who have seen everything.\nThis unexpected testimony from the archer re-encouraged the recluse,\nwhom this interrogatory was forcing to cross an abyss on the edge of\na knife. But she was condemned to a perpetual alternative of hope and\nalarm.\n\n\"If it was a cart which did it,\" retorted the first soldier, \"the stumps\nof the bars should be thrust inwards, while they actually are pushed\noutwards.\"\n\n\"Ho! ho!\" said Tristan to the soldier, \"you have the nose of an\ninquisitor of the Ch\u00c3\u00a2telet. Reply to what he says, old woman.\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" she exclaimed, driven to bay, and in a voice that was\nfull of tears in despite of her efforts, \"I swear to you, monseigneur,\nthat 'twas a cart which broke those bars. You hear the man who saw it.\nAnd then, what has that to do with your gypsy?\"\n\n\"Hum!\" growled Tristan.\n\n\"The devil!\" went on the soldier, flattered by the provost's praise,\n\"these fractures of the iron are perfectly fresh.\"\n\nTristan tossed his head. She turned pale.\n\n\"How long ago, say you, did the cart do it?\"\n\n\"A month, a fortnight, perhaps, monseigheur, I know not.\"\n\n\"She first said more than a year,\" observed the soldier.\n\n\"That is suspicious,\" said the provost.\n\n\"Monseigneur!\" she cried, still pressed against the opening, and\ntrembling lest suspicion should lead them to thrust their heads through\nand look into her cell; \"monseigneur, I swear to you that 'twas a cart\nwhich broke this grating. I swear it to you by the angels of paradise.\nIf it was not a cart, may I be eternally damned, and I reject God!\"\n\n\"You put a great deal of heat into that oath;\" said Tristan, with his\ninquisitorial glance.\n\nThe poor woman felt her assurance vanishing more and more. She had\nreached the point of blundering, and she comprehended with terror that\nshe was saying what she ought not to have said.\n\nHere another soldier came up, crying,--\n\n\"Monsieur, the old hag lies. The sorceress did not flee through the Rue\nde Mouton. The street chain has remained stretched all night, and the\nchain guard has seen no one pass.\"\n\nTristan, whose face became more sinister with every moment, addressed\nthe recluse,--\n\n\"What have you to say to that?\"\n\nShe tried to make head against this new incident,\n\n\"That I do not know, monseigneur; that I may have been mistaken. I\nbelieve, in fact, that she crossed the water.\"\n\n\"That is in the opposite direction,\" said the provost, \"and it is not\nvery likely that she would wish to re-enter the city, where she was\nbeing pursued. You are lying, old woman.\"\n\n\"And then,\" added the first soldier, \"there is no boat either on this\nside of the stream or on the other.\"\n\n\"She swam across,\" replied the recluse, defending her ground foot by\nfoot.\n\n\"Do women swim?\" said the soldier.\n\n\"_T\u00c3\u00aate Dieu_! old woman! You are lying!\" repeated Tristan angrily. \"I\nhave a good mind to abandon that sorceress and take you. A quarter of an\nhour of torture will, perchance, draw the truth from your throat. Come!\nYou are to follow us.\"\n\nShe seized on these words with avidity.\n\n\"As you please, monseigneur. Do it. Do it. Torture. I am willing. Take\nme away. Quick, quick! let us set out at once!--During that time,\" she\nsaid to herself, \"my daughter will make her escape.\"\n\n\"'S death!\" said the provost, \"what an appetite for the rack! I\nunderstand not this madwoman at all.\"\n\nAn old, gray-haired sergeant of the guard stepped out of the ranks, and\naddressing the provost,--\n\n\"Mad in sooth, monseigneur. If she released the gypsy, it was not her\nfault, for she loves not the gypsies. I have been of the watch these\nfifteen years, and I hear her every evening cursing the Bohemian women\nwith endless imprecations. If the one of whom we are in pursuit is, as I\nsuppose, the little dancer with the goat, she detests that one above all\nthe rest.\"\n\nGudule made an effort and said,--\n\n\"That one above all.\"\n\nThe unanimous testimony of the men of the watch confirmed the old\nsergeant's words to the provost. Tristan l'Hermite, in despair at\nextracting anything from the recluse, turned his back on her, and with\nunspeakable anxiety she beheld him direct his course slowly towards his\nhorse.\n\n\"Come!\" he said, between his teeth, \"March on! let us set out again on\nthe quest. I shall not sleep until that gypsy is hanged.\"\n\nBut he still hesitated for some time before mounting his horse. Gudule\npalpitated between life and death, as she beheld him cast about the\nPlace that uneasy look of a hunting dog which instinctively feels that\nthe lair of the beast is close to him, and is loath to go away. At\nlength he shook his head and leaped into his saddle. Gudule's horribly\ncompressed heart now dilated, and she said in a low voice, as she cast a\nglance at her daughter, whom she had not ventured to look at while they\nwere there, \"Saved!\"\n\nThe poor child had remained all this time in her corner, without\nbreathing, without moving, with the idea of death before her. She had\nlost nothing of the scene between Gudule and Tristan, and the anguish\nof her mother had found its echo in her heart. She had heard all the\nsuccessive snappings of the thread by which she hung suspended over the\ngulf; twenty times she had fancied that she saw it break, and at last\nshe began to breathe again and to feel her foot on firm ground. At that\nmoment she heard a voice saying to the provost: \"_Corboeuf_! Monsieur\nle Prev\u00c3\u00b4t, 'tis no affair of mine, a man of arms, to hang witches.\nThe rabble of the populace is suppressed. I leave you to attend to the\nmatter alone. You will allow me to rejoin my company, who are waiting\nfor their captain.\"\n\nThe voice was that of Phoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers; that which took place\nwithin her was ineffable. He was there, her friend, her protector, her\nsupport, her refuge, her Phoebus. She rose, and before her mother could\nprevent her, she had rushed to the window, crying,--\n\n\"Phoebus! aid me, my Phoebus!\"\n\nPhoebus was no longer there. He had just turned the corner of the Rue de\nla Coutellerie at a gallop. But Tristan had not yet taken his departure.\n\nThe recluse rushed upon her daughter with a roar of agony. She dragged\nher violently back, digging her nails into her neck. A tigress mother\ndoes not stand on trifles. But it was too late. Tristan had seen.\n\n\"H\u00c3\u00a9! h\u00c3\u00a9!\" he exclaimed with a laugh which laid bare all his teeth and\nmade his face resemble the muzzle of a wolf, \"two mice in the trap!\"\n\n\"I suspected as much,\" said the soldier.\n\nTristan clapped him on the shoulder,--\n\n\"You are a good cat! Come!\" he added, \"where is Henriet Cousin?\"\n\nA man who had neither the garments nor the air of a soldier, stepped\nfrom the ranks. He wore a costume half gray, half brown, flat hair,\nleather sleeves, and carried a bundle of ropes in his huge hand. This\nman always attended Tristan, who always attended Louis XI. \"Friend,\"\nsaid Tristan l'Hermite, \"I presume that this is the sorceress of whom we\nare in search. You will hang me this one. Have you your ladder?\"\n\n\"There is one yonder, under the shed of the Pillar-House,\" replied the\nman. \"Is it on this justice that the thing is to be done?\" he added,\npointing to the stone gibbet.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ho, h\u00c3\u00a9!\" continued the man with a huge laugh, which was still more\nbrutal than that of the provost, \"we shall not have far to go.\"\n\n\"Make haste!\" said Tristan, \"you shall laugh afterwards.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the recluse had not uttered another word since Tristan\nhad seen her daughter and all hope was lost. She had flung the poor\ngypsy, half dead, into the corner of the cellar, and had placed herself\nonce more at the window with both hands resting on the angle of the sill\nlike two claws. In this attitude she was seen to cast upon all those\nsoldiers her glance which had become wild and frantic once more. At the\nmoment when Rennet Cousin approached her cell, she showed him so savage\na face that he shrank back.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" he said, returning to the provost, \"which am I to take?\"\n\n\"The young one.\"\n\n\"So much the better, for the old one seemeth difficult.\"\n\n\"Poor little dancer with the goat!\" said the old sergeant of the watch.\n\nRennet Cousin approached the window again. The mother's eyes made his\nown droop. He said with a good deal of timidity,--\n\n\"Madam\"--\n\nShe interrupted him in a very low but furious voice,--\n\n\"What do you ask?\"\n\n\"It is not you,\" he said, \"it is the other.\"\n\n\"What other?\"\n\n\"The young one.\"\n\nShe began to shake her head, crying,--\n\n\"There is no one! there is no one! there is no one!\"\n\n\"Yes, there is!\" retorted the hangman, \"and you know it well. Let me\ntake the young one. I have no wish to harm you.\"\n\nShe said, with a strange sneer,--\n\n\"Ah! so you have no wish to harm me!\"\n\n\"Let me have the other, madam; 'tis monsieur the provost who wills it.\"\n\nShe repeated with a look of madness,--\n\n\"There is no one here.\"\n\n\"I tell you that there is!\" replied the executioner. \"We have all seen\nthat there are two of you.\"\n\n\"Look then!\" said the recluse, with a sneer. \"Thrust your head through\nthe window.\"\n\nThe executioner observed the mother's finger-nails and dared not.\n\n\"Make haste!\" shouted Tristan, who had just ranged his troops in a\ncircle round the Rat-Hole, and who sat on his horse beside the gallows.\n\nRennet returned once more to the provost in great embarrassment. He had\nflung his rope on the ground, and was twisting his hat between his hands\nwith an awkward air.\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" he asked, \"where am I to enter?\"\n\n\"By the door.\"\n\n\"There is none.\"\n\n\"By the window.\"\n\n\"'Tis too small.\"\n\n\"Make it larger,\" said Tristan angrily. \"Have you not pickaxes?\"\n\nThe mother still looked on steadfastly from the depths of her cavern.\nShe no longer hoped for anything, she no longer knew what she wished,\nexcept that she did not wish them to take her daughter.\n\nRennet Cousin went in search of the chest of tools for the night man,\nunder the shed of the Pillar-House. He drew from it also the double\nladder, which he immediately set up against the gallows. Five or six of\nthe provost's men armed themselves with picks and crowbars, and Tristan\nbetook himself, in company with them, towards the window.\n\n\"Old woman,\" said the provost, in a severe tone, \"deliver up to us that\ngirl quietly.\"\n\nShe looked at him like one who does not understand.\n\n\"_T\u00c3\u00aate Dieu_!\" continued Tristan, \"why do you try to prevent this\nsorceress being hung as it pleases the king?\"\n\nThe wretched woman began to laugh in her wild way.\n\n\"Why? She is my daughter.\"\n\nThe tone in which she pronounced these words made even Henriet Cousin\nshudder.\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" said the provost, \"but it is the king's good\npleasure.\"\n\nShe cried, redoubling her terrible laugh,--\n\n\"What is your king to me? I tell you that she is my daughter!\"\n\n\"Pierce the wall,\" said Tristan.\n\nIn order to make a sufficiently wide opening, it sufficed to dislodge\none course of stone below the window. When the mother heard the picks\nand crowbars mining her fortress, she uttered a terrible cry; then she\nbegan to stride about her cell with frightful swiftness, a wild beasts'\nhabit which her cage had imparted to her. She no longer said anything,\nbut her eyes flamed. The soldiers were chilled to the very soul.\n\nAll at once she seized her paving stone, laughed, and hurled it with\nboth fists upon the workmen. The stone, badly flung (for her hands\ntrembled), touched no one, and fell short under the feet of Tristan's\nhorse. She gnashed her teeth.\n\nIn the meantime, although the sun had not yet risen, it was broad\ndaylight; a beautiful rose color enlivened the ancient, decayed chimneys\nof the Pillar-House. It was the hour when the earliest windows of the\ngreat city open joyously on the roofs. Some workmen, a few fruit-sellers\non their way to the markets on their asses, began to traverse the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve;\nthey halted for a moment before this group of soldiers clustered round\nthe Rat-Hole, stared at it with an air of astonishment and passed on.\n\nThe recluse had gone and seated herself by her daughter, covering her\nwith her body, in front of her, with staring eyes, listening to the poor\nchild, who did not stir, but who kept murmuring in a low voice, these\nwords only, \"Phoebus! Phoebus!\" In proportion as the work of the\ndemolishers seemed to advance, the mother mechanically retreated, and\npressed the young girl closer and closer to the wall. All at once, the\nrecluse beheld the stone (for she was standing guard and never took\nher eyes from it), move, and she heard Tristan's voice encouraging the\nworkers. Then she aroused from the depression into which she had fallen\nduring the last few moments, cried out, and as she spoke, her voice\nnow rent the ear like a saw, then stammered as though all kind of\nmaledictions were pressing to her lips to burst forth at once.\n\n\"Ho! ho! ho! Why this is terrible! You are ruffians! Are you really\ngoing to take my daughter? Oh! the cowards! Oh! the hangman lackeys!\nthe wretched, blackguard assassins! Help! help! fire! Will they take my\nchild from me like this? Who is it then who is called the good God?\"\n\nThen, addressing Tristan, foaming at the mouth, with wild eyes, all\nbristling and on all fours like a female panther,--\n\n\"Draw near and take my daughter! Do not you understand that this woman\ntells you that she is my daughter? Do you know what it is to have a\nchild? Eh! lynx, have you never lain with your female? have you never\nhad a cub? and if you have little ones, when they howl have you nothing\nin your vitals that moves?\"\n\n\"Throw down the stone,\" said Tristan; \"it no longer holds.\"\n\nThe crowbars raised the heavy course. It was, as we have said, the\nmother's last bulwark.\n\nShe threw herself upon it, she tried to hold it back; she scratched the\nstone with her nails, but the massive block, set in movement by six men,\nescaped her and glided gently to the ground along the iron levers.\n\nThe mother, perceiving an entrance effected, fell down in front of the\nopening, barricading the breach with her body, beating the pavement with\nher head, and shrieking with a voice rendered so hoarse by fatigue that\nit was hardly audible,--\n\n\"Help! fire! fire!\"\n\n\"Now take the wench,\" said Tristan, still impassive.\n\nThe mother gazed at the soldiers in such formidable fashion that they\nwere more inclined to retreat than to advance.\n\n\"Come, now,\" repeated the provost. \"Here you, Rennet Cousin!\"\n\nNo one took a step.\n\nThe provost swore,--\n\n\"_T\u00c3\u00aate de Christ_! my men of war! afraid of a woman!\"\n\n\"Monseigneur,\" said Rennet, \"do you call that a woman?\"\n\n\"She has the mane of a lion,\" said another.\n\n\"Come!\" repeated the provost, \"the gap is wide enough. Enter three\nabreast, as at the breach of Pontoise. Let us make an end of it, death\nof Mahom! I will make two pieces of the first man who draws back!\"\n\nPlaced between the provost and the mother, both threatening, the\nsoldiers hesitated for a moment, then took their resolution, and\nadvanced towards the Rat-Hole.\n\nWhen the recluse saw this, she rose abruptly on her knees, flung aside\nher hair from her face, then let her thin flayed hands fall by her side.\nThen great tears fell, one by one, from her eyes; they flowed down\nher cheeks through a furrow, like a torrent through a bed which it has\nhollowed for itself.\n\nAt the same time she began to speak, but in a voice so supplicating,\nso gentle, so submissive, so heartrending, that more than one old\nconvict-warder around Tristan who must have devoured human flesh wiped\nhis eyes.\n\n\"Messeigneurs! messieurs the sergeants, one word. There is one thing\nwhich I must say to you. She is my daughter, do you see? my dear little\ndaughter whom I had lost! Listen. It is quite a history. Consider that\nI knew the sergeants very well. They were always good to me in the\ndays when the little boys threw stones at me, because I led a life of\npleasure. Do you see? You will leave me my child when you know! I was a\npoor woman of the town. It was the Bohemians who stole her from me. And\nI kept her shoe for fifteen years. Stay, here it is. That was the kind\nof foot which she had. At Reims! La Chantefleurie! Rue Folle-Peine!\nPerchance, you knew about that. It was I. In your youth, then, there was\na merry time, when one passed good hours. You will take pity on me, will\nyou not, gentlemen? The gypsies stole her from me; they hid her from me\nfor fifteen years. I thought her dead. Fancy, my good friends, believed\nher to be dead. I have passed fifteen years here in this cellar, without\na fire in winter. It is hard. The poor, dear little shoe! I have cried\nso much that the good God has heard me. This night he has given my\ndaughter back to me. It is a miracle of the good God. She was not dead.\nYou will not take her from me, I am sure. If it were myself, I would\nsay nothing; but she, a child of sixteen! Leave her time to see the sun!\nWhat has she done to you? nothing at all. Nor have I. If you did but\nknow that she is all I have, that I am old, that she is a blessing which\nthe Holy Virgin has sent to me! And then, you are all so good! You did\nnot know that she was my daughter; but now you do know it. Oh! I love\nher! Monsieur, the grand provost. I would prefer a stab in my own vitals\nto a scratch on her finger! You have the air of such a good lord! What\nI have told you explains the matter, does it not? Oh! if you have had\na mother, monsiegneur! you are the captain, leave me my child! Consider\nthat I pray you on my knees, as one prays to Jesus Christ! I ask nothing\nof any one; I am from Reims, gentlemen; I own a little field inherited\nfrom my uncle, Mahiet Pradon. I am no beggar. I wish nothing, but I do\nwant my child! oh! I want to keep my child! The good God, who is the\nmaster, has not given her back to me for nothing! The king! you say the\nking! It would not cause him much pleasure to have my little daughter\nkilled! And then, the king is good! she is my daughter! she is my own\ndaughter! She belongs not to the king! she is not yours! I want to go\naway! we want to go away! and when two women pass, one a mother and the\nother a daughter, one lets them go! Let us pass! we belong in Reims. Oh!\nyou are very good, messieurs the sergeants, I love you all. You will not\ntake my dear little one, it is impossible! It is utterly impossible, is\nit not? My child, my child!\"\n\nWe will not try to give an idea of her gestures, her tone, of the tears\nwhich she swallowed as she spoke, of the hands which she clasped and\nthen wrung, of the heart-breaking smiles, of the swimming glances,\nof the groans, the sighs, the miserable and affecting cries which she\nmingled with her disordered, wild, and incoherent words. When she became\nsilent Tristan l'Hermite frowned, but it was to conceal a tear which\nwelled up in his tiger's eye. He conquered this weakness, however, and\nsaid in a curt tone,--\n\n\"The king wills it.\"\n\nThen he bent down to the ear of Rennet Cousin, and said to him in a very\nlow tone,--\n\n\"Make an end of it quickly!\" Possibly, the redoubtable provost felt his\nheart also failing him.\n\nThe executioner and the sergeants entered the cell. The mother offered\nno resistance, only she dragged herself towards her daughter and threw\nherself bodily upon her. The gypsy beheld the soldiers approach. The\nhorror of death reanimated her,--\n\n\"Mother!\" she shrieked, in a tone of indescribable distress, \"Mother!\nthey are coming! defend me!\"\n\n\"Yes, my love, I am defending you!\" replied the mother, in a dying\nvoice; and clasping her closely in her arms, she covered her with\nkisses. The two lying thus on the earth, the mother upon the daughter,\npresented a spectacle worthy of pity.\n\nRennet Cousin grasped the young girl by the middle of her body, beneath\nher beautiful shoulders. When she felt that hand, she cried, \"Heuh!\" and\nfainted. The executioner who was shedding large tears upon her, drop\nby drop, was about to bear her away in his arms. He tried to detach the\nmother, who had, so to speak, knotted her hands around her daughter's\nwaist; but she clung so strongly to her child, that it was impossible\nto separate them. Then Rennet Cousin dragged the young girl outside the\ncell, and the mother after her. The mother's eyes were also closed.\n\nAt that moment, the sun rose, and there was already on the Place a\nfairly numerous assembly of people who looked on from a distance at what\nwas being thus dragged along the pavement to the gibbet. For that was\nProvost Tristan's way at executions. He had a passion for preventing the\napproach of the curious.\n\nThere was no one at the windows. Only at a distance, at the summit of\nthat one of the towers of Notre-Dame which commands the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve, two men\noutlined in black against the light morning sky, and who seemed to be\nlooking on, were visible.\n\nRennet Cousin paused at the foot of the fatal ladder, with that which\nhe was dragging, and, barely breathing, with so much pity did the thing\ninspire him, he passed the rope around the lovely neck of the young\ngirl. The unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp. She\nraised her eyelids, and saw the fleshless arm of the stone gallows\nextended above her head. Then she shook herself and shrieked in a loud\nand heartrending voice: \"No! no! I will not!\" Her mother, whose head was\nburied and concealed in her daughter's garments, said not a word; only\nher whole body could be seen to quiver, and she was heard to redouble\nher kisses on her child. The executioner took advantage of this moment\nto hastily loose the arms with which she clasped the condemned girl.\nEither through exhaustion or despair, she let him have his way. Then he\ntook the young girl on his shoulder, from which the charming creature\nhung, gracefully bent over his large head. Then he set his foot on the\nladder in order to ascend.\n\nAt that moment, the mother who was crouching on the pavement, opened\nher eyes wide. Without uttering a cry, she raised herself erect with\na terrible expression; then she flung herself upon the hand of the\nexecutioner, like a beast on its prey, and bit it. It was done like a\nflash of lightning. The headsman howled with pain. Those near by rushed\nup. With difficulty they withdrew his bleeding hand from the mother's\nteeth. She preserved a profound silence. They thrust her back with much\nbrutality, and noticed that her head fell heavily on the pavement. They\nraised her, she fell back again. She was dead.\n\nThe executioner, who had not loosed his hold on the young girl, began to\nascend the ladder once more.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. THE BEAUTIFUL CREATURE CLAD IN WHITE. (Dante.)\n\n\n\nWhen Quasimodo saw that the cell was empty, that the gypsy was no longer\nthere, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he\ngrasped his hair with both hands and stamped with surprise and pain;\nthen he set out to run through the entire church seeking his Bohemian,\nhowling strange cries to all the corners of the walls, strewing his red\nhair on the pavement. It was just at the moment when the king's archers\nwere making their victorious entrance into Notre-Dame, also in search\nof the gypsy. Quasimodo, poor, deaf fellow, aided them in their fatal\nintentions, without suspecting it; he thought that the outcasts were the\ngypsy's enemies. He himself conducted Tristan l'Hermite to all possible\nhiding-places, opened to him the secret doors, the double bottoms of\nthe altars, the rear sacristries. If the unfortunate girl had still been\nthere, it would have been he himself who would have delivered her up.\n\nWhen the fatigue of finding nothing had disheartened Tristan, who was\nnot easily discouraged, Quasimodo continued the search alone. He made\nthe tour of the church twenty times, length and breadth, up and\ndown, ascending and descending, running, calling, shouting, peeping,\nrummaging, ransacking, thrusting his head into every hole, pushing a\ntorch under every vault, despairing, mad. A male who has lost his female\nis no more roaring nor more haggard.\n\nAt last when he was sure, perfectly sure that she was no longer there,\nthat all was at an end, that she had been snatched from him, he slowly\nmounted the staircase to the towers, that staircase which he had\nascended with so much eagerness and triumph on the day when he had\nsaved her. He passed those same places once more with drooping head,\nvoiceless, tearless, almost breathless. The church was again deserted,\nand had fallen back into its silence. The archers had quitted it to\ntrack the sorceress in the city. Quasimodo, left alone in that vast\nNotre-Dame, so besieged and tumultuous but a short time before, once\nmore betook himself to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many\nweeks under his guardianship.\n\nAs he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there.\nWhen, at the turn of the gallery which opens on the roof of the side\naisles, he perceived the tiny cell with its little window and its little\ndoor crouching beneath a great flying buttress like a bird's nest under\na branch, the poor man's heart failed him, and he leaned against a\npillar to keep from falling. He imagined that she might have returned\nthither, that some good genius had, no doubt, brought her back, that\nthis chamber was too tranquil, too safe, too charming for her not to\nbe there, and he dared not take another step for fear of destroying\nhis illusion. \"Yes,\" he said to himself, \"perchance she is sleeping, or\npraying. I must not disturb her.\"\n\nAt length he summoned up courage, advanced on tiptoe, looked, entered.\nEmpty. The cell was still empty. The unhappy deaf man walked slowly\nround it, lifted the bed and looked beneath it, as though she might be\nconcealed between the pavement and the mattress, then he shook his head\nand remained stupefied. All at once, he crushed his torch under his\nfoot, and, without uttering a word, without giving vent to a sigh, he\nflung himself at full speed, head foremost against the wall, and fell\nfainting on the floor.\n\nWhen he recovered his senses, he threw himself on the bed and rolling\nabout, he kissed frantically the place where the young girl had slept\nand which was still warm; he remained there for several moments as\nmotionless as though he were about to expire; then he rose, dripping\nwith perspiration, panting, mad, and began to beat his head against the\nwall with the frightful regularity of the clapper of his bells, and\nthe resolution of a man determined to kill himself. At length he fell\na second time, exhausted; he dragged himself on his knees outside the\ncell, and crouched down facing the door, in an attitude of astonishment.\n\nHe remained thus for more than an hour without making a movement, with\nhis eye fixed on the deserted cell, more gloomy, and more pensive than a\nmother seated between an empty cradle and a full coffin. He uttered not\na word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it\nwas a tearless sob, like summer lightning which makes no noise.\n\nIt appears to have been then, that, seeking at the bottom of his lonely\nthoughts for the unexpected abductor of the gypsy, he thought of the\narchdeacon. He remembered that Dom Claude alone possessed a key to the\nstaircase leading to the cell; he recalled his nocturnal attempts on\nthe young girl, in the first of which he, Quasimodo, had assisted, the\nsecond of which he had prevented. He recalled a thousand details, and\nsoon he no longer doubted that the archdeacon had taken the gypsy.\nNevertheless, such was his respect for the priest, such his gratitude,\nhis devotion, his love for this man had taken such deep root in his\nheart, that they resisted, even at this moment, the talons of jealousy\nand despair.\n\nHe reflected that the archdeacon had done this thing, and the wrath\nof blood and death which it would have evoked in him against any other\nperson, turned in the poor deaf man, from the moment when Claude Frollo\nwas in question, into an increase of grief and sorrow.\n\nAt the moment when his thought was thus fixed upon the priest, while\nthe daybreak was whitening the flying buttresses, he perceived on\nthe highest story of Notre-Dame, at the angle formed by the external\nbalustrade as it makes the turn of the chancel, a figure walking. This\nfigure was coming towards him. He recognized it. It was the archdeacon.\n\nClaude was walking with a slow, grave step. He did not look before him\nas he walked, he was directing his course towards the northern tower,\nbut his face was turned aside towards the right bank of the Seine, and\nhe held his head high, as though trying to see something over the roofs.\nThe owl often assumes this oblique attitude. It flies towards one\npoint and looks towards another. In this manner the priest passed above\nQuasimodo without seeing him.\n\nThe deaf man, who had been petrified by this sudden apparition, beheld\nhim disappear through the door of the staircase to the north tower. The\nreader is aware that this is the tower from which the H\u00c3\u00b4tel-de-Ville is\nvisible. Quasimodo rose and followed the archdeacon.\n\nQuasimodo ascended the tower staircase for the sake of ascending it, for\nthe sake of seeing why the priest was ascending it. Moreover, the poor\nbellringer did not know what he (Quasimodo) should do, what he\nshould say, what he wished. He was full of fury and full of fear. The\narchdeacon and the gypsy had come into conflict in his heart.\n\nWhen he reached the summit of the tower, before emerging from the shadow\nof the staircase and stepping upon the platform, he cautiously examined\nthe position of the priest. The priest's back was turned to him. There\nis an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell\ntower. The priest, whose eyes looked down upon the town, was resting his\nbreast on that one of the four sides of the balustrades which looks upon\nthe Pont Notre-Dame.\n\nQuasimodo, advancing with the tread of a wolf behind him, went to see\nwhat he was gazing at thus.\n\nThe priest's attention was so absorbed elsewhere that he did not hear\nthe deaf man walking behind him.\n\nParis is a magnificent and charming spectacle, and especially at that\nday, viewed from the top of the towers of Notre-Dame, in the fresh light\nof a summer dawn. The day might have been in July. The sky was perfectly\nserene. Some tardy stars were fading away at various points, and there\nwas a very brilliant one in the east, in the brightest part of the\nheavens. The sun was about to appear; Paris was beginning to move. A\nvery white and very pure light brought out vividly to the eye all the\noutlines that its thousands of houses present to the east. The giant\nshadow of the towers leaped from roof to roof, from one end of the great\ncity to the other. There were several quarters from which were already\nheard voices and noisy sounds. Here the stroke of a bell, there the\nstroke of a hammer, beyond, the complicated clatter of a cart in motion.\n\nAlready several columns of smoke were being belched forth from the\nchimneys scattered over the whole surface of roofs, as through the\nfissures of an immense sulphurous crater. The river, which ruffles its\nwaters against the arches of so many bridges, against the points of so\nmany islands, was wavering with silvery folds. Around the city, outside\nthe ramparts, sight was lost in a great circle of fleecy vapors through\nwhich one confusedly distinguished the indefinite line of the plains,\nand the graceful swell of the heights. All sorts of floating sounds were\ndispersed over this half-awakened city. Towards the east, the morning\nbreeze chased a few soft white bits of wool torn from the misty fleece\nof the hills.\n\nIn the Parvis, some good women, who had their milk jugs in their\nhands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular\ndilapidation of the great door of Notre-Dame, and the two solidified\nstreams of lead in the crevices of the stone. This was all that remained\nof the tempest of the night. The bonfire lighted between the towers by\nQuasimodo had died out. Tristan had already cleared up the Place, and\nhad the dead thrown into the Seine. Kings like Louis XI. are careful to\nclean the pavement quickly after a massacre.\n\nOutside the balustrade of the tower, directly under the point where the\npriest had paused, there was one of those fantastically carved stone\ngutters with which Gothic edifices bristle, and, in a crevice of that\ngutter, two pretty wallflowers in blossom, shaken out and vivified,\nas it were, by the breath of air, made frolicsome salutations to each\nother. Above the towers, on high, far away in the depths of the sky, the\ncries of little birds were heard.\n\nBut the priest was not listening to, was not looking at, anything of all\nthis. He was one of the men for whom there are no mornings, no birds,\nno flowers. In that immense horizon, which assumed so many aspects about\nhim, his contemplation was concentrated on a single point.\n\nQuasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy; but\nthe archdeacon seemed to be out of the world at that moment. He was\nevidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not\nfeel the earth crumble. He remained motionless and silent, with his eyes\nsteadily fixed on a certain point; and there was something so terrible\nabout this silence and immobility that the savage bellringer shuddered\nbefore it and dared not come in contact with it. Only, and this was also\none way of interrogating the archdeacon, he followed the direction of\nhis vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy deaf man fell upon\nthe Place de Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\nThus he saw what the priest was looking at. The ladder was erected near\nthe permanent gallows. There were some people and many soldiers in\nthe Place. A man was dragging a white thing, from which hung something\nblack, along the pavement. This man halted at the foot of the gallows.\n\nHere something took place which Quasimodo could not see very clearly. It\nwas not because his only eye had not preserved its long range, but there\nwas a group of soldiers which prevented his seeing everything. Moreover,\nat that moment the sun appeared, and such a flood of light overflowed\nthe horizon that one would have said that all the points in Paris,\nspires, chimneys, gables, had simultaneously taken fire.\n\nMeanwhile, the man began to mount the ladder. Then Quasimodo saw him\nagain distinctly. He was carrying a woman on his shoulder, a young girl\ndressed in white; that young girl had a noose about her neck. Quasimodo\nrecognized her.\n\nIt was she.\n\nThe man reached the top of the ladder. There he arranged the noose. Here\nthe priest, in order to see the better, knelt upon the balustrade.\n\nAll at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and Quasimodo, who\nhad not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling\nat the end of the rope two fathoms above the pavement, with the man\nsquatting on her shoulders. The rope made several gyrations on itself,\nand Quasimodo beheld horrible convulsions run along the gypsy's body.\nThe priest, on his side, with outstretched neck and eyes starting from\nhis head, contemplated this horrible group of the man and the young\ngirl,--the spider and the fly.\n\nAt the moment when it was most horrible, the laugh of a demon, a laugh\nwhich one can only give vent to when one is no longer human, burst forth\non the priest's livid face.\n\nQuasimodo did not hear that laugh, but he saw it.\n\nThe bellringer retreated several paces behind the archdeacon, and\nsuddenly hurling himself upon him with fury, with his huge hands he\npushed him by the back over into the abyss over which Dom Claude was\nleaning.\n\nThe priest shrieked: \"Damnation!\" and fell.\n\nThe spout, above which he had stood, arrested him in his fall. He clung\nto it with desperate hands, and, at the moment when he opened his mouth\nto utter a second cry, he beheld the formidable and avenging face of\nQuasimodo thrust over the edge of the balustrade above his head.\n\nThen he was silent.\n\nThe abyss was there below him. A fall of more than two hundred feet and\nthe pavement.\n\nIn this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not\na groan. He merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to\nclimb up again; but his hands had no hold on the granite, his feet slid\nalong the blackened wall without catching fast. People who have ascended\nthe towers of Notre-Dame know that there is a swell of the stone\nimmediately beneath the balustrade. It was on this retreating angle\nthat miserable archdeacon exhausted himself. He had not to deal with a\nperpendicular wall, but with one which sloped away beneath him.\n\nQuasimodo had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the\ngulf; but he did not even look at him. He was looking at the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve. He\nwas looking at the gallows. He was looking at the gypsy.\n\nThe deaf man was leaning, with his elbows on the balustrade, at the\nspot where the archdeacon had been a moment before, and there, never\ndetaching his gaze from the only object which existed for him in the\nworld at that moment, he remained motionless and mute, like a man struck\nby lightning, and a long stream of tears flowed in silence from that eye\nwhich, up to that time, had never shed but one tear.\n\nMeanwhile, the archdeacon was panting. His bald brow was dripping with\nperspiration, his nails were bleeding against the stones, his knees were\nflayed by the wall.\n\nHe heard his cassock, which was caught on the spout, crack and rip at\nevery jerk that he gave it. To complete his misfortune, this spout ended\nin a leaden pipe which bent under the weight of his body. The archdeacon\nfelt this pipe slowly giving way. The miserable man said to himself\nthat, when his hands should be worn out with fatigue, when his cassock\nshould tear asunder, when the lead should give way, he would be obliged\nto fall, and terror seized upon his very vitals. Now and then he glanced\nwildly at a sort of narrow shelf formed, ten feet lower down, by\nprojections of the sculpture, and he prayed heaven, from the depths of\nhis distressed soul, that he might be allowed to finish his life, were\nit to last two centuries, on that space two feet square. Once, he\nglanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he\nraised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.\n\nThere was something frightful in the silence of these two men. While\nthe archdeacon agonized in this terrible fashion a few feet below him,\nQuasimodo wept and gazed at the Gr\u00c3\u00a8ve.\n\nThe archdeacon, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the\nfragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet. There he\nhung, embracing the gutter, hardly breathing, no longer stirring, making\nno longer any other movements than that mechanical convulsion of the\nstomach, which one experiences in dreams when one fancies himself\nfalling. His fixed eyes were wide open with a stare. He lost ground\nlittle by little, nevertheless, his fingers slipped along the spout;\nhe became more and more conscious of the feebleness of his arms and the\nweight of his body. The curve of the lead which sustained him inclined\nmore and more each instant towards the abyss.\n\nHe beheld below him, a frightful thing, the roof of Saint-Jean le Rond,\nas small as a card folded in two. He gazed at the impressive carvings,\none by one, of the tower, suspended like himself over the precipice, but\nwithout terror for themselves or pity for him. All was stone around him;\nbefore his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the\nPlace, the pavement; above his head, Quasimodo weeping.\n\nIn the Parvis there were several groups of curious good people, who were\ntranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing\nhimself in so strange a manner. The priest heard them saying, for their\nvoices reached him, clear and shrill: \"Why, he will break his neck!\"\n\nQuasimodo wept.\n\nAt last the archdeacon, foaming with rage and despair, understood that\nall was in vain. Nevertheless, he collected all the strength which\nremained to him for a final effort. He stiffened himself upon the spout,\npushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the\nstones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot,\nperhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested\nbend abruptly. His cassock burst open at the same time. Then, feeling\neverything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and\nfailing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and\nlet go of the spout. He fell.\n\nQuasimodo watched him fall.\n\nA fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular. The archdeacon,\nlaunched into space, fell at first head foremost, with outspread hands;\nthen he whirled over and over many times; the wind blew him upon\nthe roof of a house, where the unfortunate man began to break up.\nNevertheless, he was not dead when he reached there. The bellringer saw\nhim still endeavor to cling to a gable with his nails; but the surface\nsloped too much, and he had no more strength. He slid rapidly along the\nroof like a loosened tile, and dashed upon the pavement. There he no\nlonger moved.\n\nThen Quasimodo raised his eyes to the gypsy, whose body he beheld\nhanging from the gibbet, quivering far away beneath her white robe with\nthe last shudderings of anguish, then he dropped them on the archdeacon,\nstretched out at the base of the tower, and no longer retaining the\nhuman form, and he said, with a sob which heaved his deep chest,--\"Oh!\nall that I have ever loved!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. THE MARRIAGE OF PHOEBUS.\n\n\n\nTowards evening on that day, when the judiciary officers of the bishop\ncame to pick up from the pavement of the Parvis the dislocated corpse of\nthe archdeacon, Quasimodo had disappeared.\n\nA great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this adventure.\nNo one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their\ncompact, Quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off Claude\nFrollo, that is to say, the sorcerer. It was presumed that he had broken\nthe body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get\nat the nut.\n\nThis is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth.\n\nLouis XI. died a year later, in the month of August, 1483.\n\nAs for Pierre Gringoire, he succeeded in saving the goat, and he won\nsuccess in tragedy. It appears that, after having tasted astrology,\nphilosophy, architecture, hermetics,--all vanities, he returned to\ntragedy, vainest pursuit of all. This is what he called \"coming to a\ntragic end.\" This is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic\ntriumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the \"Ordinary:\" \"To Jehan Marchand\nand Pierre Gringoire, carpenter and composer, who have made and composed\nthe mystery made at the Ch\u00c3\u00a3telet of Paris, at the entry of Monsieur the\nLegate, and have ordered the personages, clothed and dressed the same,\nas in the said mystery was required; and likewise, for having made the\nscaffoldings thereto necessary; and for this deed,--one hundred livres.\"\n\nPhoebus de Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaupers also came to a tragic end. He married.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. THE MARRIAGE OF QUASIMODO.\n\n\n\nWe have just said that Quasimodo disappeared from Notre-Dame on the day\nof the gypsy's and of the archdeacon's death. He was not seen again, in\nfact; no one knew what had become of him.\n\nDuring the night which followed the execution of la Esmeralda, the night\nmen had detached her body from the gibbet, and had carried it, according\nto custom, to the cellar of Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on.\n\nMontfau\u00c3\u00a7on was, as Sauval says, \"the most ancient and the most superb\ngibbet in the kingdom.\" Between the faubourgs of the Temple and Saint\nMartin, about a hundred and sixty toises from the walls of Paris, a\nfew bow shots from La Courtille, there was to be seen on the crest of a\ngentle, almost imperceptible eminence, but sufficiently elevated to\nbe seen for several leagues round about, an edifice of strange form,\nbearing considerable resemblance to a Celtic cromlech, and where also\nhuman sacrifices were offered.\n\nLet the reader picture to himself, crowning a limestone hillock, an\noblong mass of masonry fifteen feet in height, thirty wide, forty\nlong, with a gate, an external railing and a platform; on this platform\nsixteen enormous pillars of rough hewn stone, thirty feet in height,\narranged in a colonnade round three of the four sides of the mass which\nsupport them, bound together at their summits by heavy beams, whence\nhung chains at intervals; on all these chains, skeletons; in the\nvicinity, on the plain, a stone cross and two gibbets of secondary\nimportance, which seemed to have sprung up as shoots around the central\ngallows; above all this, in the sky, a perpetual flock of crows; that\nwas Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on.\n\nAt the end of the fifteenth century, the formidable gibbet which dated\nfrom 1328, was already very much dilapidated; the beams were wormeaten,\nthe chains rusted, the pillars green with mould; the layers of hewn\nstone were all cracked at their joints, and grass was growing on that\nplatform which no feet touched. The monument made a horrible profile\nagainst the sky; especially at night when there was a little moonlight\non those white skulls, or when the breeze of evening brushed the chains\nand the skeletons, and swayed all these in the darkness. The presence of\nthis gibbet sufficed to render gloomy all the surrounding places.\n\nThe mass of masonry which served as foundation to the odious edifice was\nhollow. A huge cellar had been constructed there, closed by an old iron\ngrating, which was out of order, into which were cast not only the human\nremains, which were taken from the chains of Montfau\u00c3\u00a7on, but also the\nbodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent gibbets\nof Paris. To that deep charnel-house, where so many human remains and so\nmany crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world,\nmany innocent people, have contributed their bones, from Enguerrand de\nMarigni, the first victim, and a just man, to Admiral de Coligni, who\nwas its last, and who was also a just man.\n\nAs for the mysterious disappearance of Quasimodo, this is all that we\nhave been able to discover.\n\nAbout eighteen months or two years after the events which terminate this\nstory, when search was made in that cavern for the body of Olivier le\nDaim, who had been hanged two days previously, and to whom Charles\nVIII. had granted the favor of being buried in Saint Laurent, in better\ncompany, they found among all those hideous carcasses two skeletons, one\nof which held the other in its embrace. One of these skeletons, which\nwas that of a woman, still had a few strips of a garment which had once\nbeen white, and around her neck was to be seen a string of adr\u00c3\u00a9zarach\nbeads with a little silk bag ornamented with green glass, which was open\nand empty. These objects were of so little value that the executioner\nhad probably not cared for them. The other, which held this one in a\nclose embrace, was the skeleton of a man. It was noticed that his spinal\ncolumn was crooked, his head seated on his shoulder blades, and that one\nleg was shorter than the other. Moreover, there was no fracture of the\nvertebrae at the nape of the neck, and it was evident that he had not\nbeen hanged. Hence, the man to whom it had belonged had come thither and\nhad died there. When they tried to detach the skeleton which he held in\nhis embrace, he fell to dust.\n\n\n\n\nNOTE\n\nADDED TO THE DEFINITIVE EDITION.\n\n\n\nIt is by mistake that this edition was announced as augmented by many\nnew chapters. The word should have been unpublished. In fact, if by new,\nnewly made is to be understood, the chapters added to this edition are\nnot new. They were written at the same time as the rest of the work;\nthey date from the same epoch, and sprang from the same thought, they\nhave always formed a part of the manuscript of \"Notre-Dame-de-Paris.\"\nMoreover, the author cannot comprehend how fresh developments could be\nadded to a work of this character after its completion. This is not to\nbe done at will. According to his idea, a romance is born in a manner\nthat is, in some sort, necessary, with all its chapters; a drama is born\nwith all its scenes. Think not that there is anything arbitrary in the\nnumbers of parts of which that whole, that mysterious microcosm which\nyou call a drama or a romance, is composed. Grafting and soldering\ntake badly on works of this nature, which should gush forth in a single\nstream and so remain. The thing once done, do not change your mind, do\nnot touch it up. The book once published, the sex of the work, whether\nvirile or not, has been recognized and proclaimed; when the child has\nonce uttered his first cry he is born, there he is, he is made so,\nneither father nor mother can do anything, he belongs to the air and\nto the sun, let him live or die, such as he is. Has your book been a\nfailure? So much the worse. Add no chapters to an unsuccessful book. Is\nit incomplete? You should have completed it when you conceived it.\nIs your tree crooked? You cannot straighten it up. Is your romance\nconsumptive? Is your romance not capable of living? You cannot supply it\nwith the breath which it lacks. Has your drama been born lame? Take my\nadvice, and do not provide it with a wooden leg.\n\nHence the author attaches particular importance to the public knowing\nfor a certainty that the chapters here added have not been made\nexpressly for this reprint. They were not published in the preceding\neditions of the book for a very simple reason. At the time when\n\"Notre-Dame-de-Paris\" was printed the first time, the manuscript of\nthese three chapters had been mislaid. It was necessary to rewrite them\nor to dispense with them. The author considered that the only two of\nthese chapters which were in the least important, owing to their extent,\nwere chapters on art and history which in no way interfered with the\ngroundwork of the drama and the romance, that the public would not\nnotice their loss, and that he, the author, would alone be in possession\nof the secret. He decided to omit them, and then, if the whole truth\nmust be confessed, his indolence shrunk from the task of rewriting the\nthree lost chapters. He would have found it a shorter matter to make a\nnew romance.\n\nNow the chapters have been found, and he avails himself of the first\nopportunity to restore them to their place.\n\nThis now, is his entire work, such as he dreamed it, such as he made it,\ngood or bad, durable or fragile, but such as he wishes it.\n\nThese recovered chapters will possess no doubt, but little value in\nthe eyes of persons, otherwise very judicious, who have sought in\n\"Notre-Dame-de-Paris\" only the drama, the romance. But there are\nperchance, other readers, who have not found it useless to study the\naesthetic and philosophic thought concealed in this book, and who have\ntaken pleasure, while reading \"Notre-Dame-de-Paris,\" in unravelling\nbeneath the romance something else than the romance, and in following\n(may we be pardoned these rather ambitious expressions), the system\nof the historian and the aim of the artist through the creation of the\npoet.\n\nFor such people especially, the chapters added to this edition will\ncomplete \"Notre-Dame-de-Paris,\" if we admit that \"Notre-Dame-de-Paris\"\nwas worth the trouble of completing.\n\nIn one of these chapters on the present decadence of architecture, and\non the death (in his mind almost inevitable) of that king of arts, the\nauthor expresses and develops an opinion unfortunately well rooted in\nhim, and well thought out. But he feels it necessary to say here that he\nearnestly desires that the future may, some day, put him in the wrong.\nHe knows that art in all its forms has everything to hope from the new\ngenerations whose genius, still in the germ, can be heard gushing forth\nin our studios. The grain is in the furrow, the harvest will certainly\nbe fine. He merely fears, and the reason may be seen in the second\nvolume of this edition, that the sap may have been withdrawn from that\nancient soil of architecture which has been for so many centuries the\nbest field for art.\n\nNevertheless, there are to-day in the artistic youth so much life,\npower, and, so to speak, predestination, that in our schools of\narchitecture in particular, at the present time, the professors, who\nare detestable, produce, not only unconsciously but even in spite of\nthemselves, excellent pupils; quite the reverse of that potter mentioned\nby Horace, who dreamed amphorae and produced pots. _Currit rota, urcens\nexit_.\n\nBut, in any case, whatever may be the future of architecture, in\nwhatever manner our young architects may one day solve the question of\ntheir art, let us, while waiting for new monument, preserve the ancient\nmonuments. Let us, if possible, inspire the nation with a love for\nnational architecture. That, the author declares, is one of the\nprincipal aims of this book; it is one of the principal aims of his\nlife.\n\n\"Notre-Dame-de-Paris\" has, perhaps opened some true perspectives on the\nart of the Middle Ages, on that marvellous art which up to the present\ntime has been unknown to some, and, what is worse, misknown by others.\nBut the author is far from regarding as accomplished, the task which he\nhas voluntarily imposed on himself. He has already pleaded on more than\none occasion, the cause of our ancient architecture, he has already\nloudly denounced many profanations, many demolitions, many impieties. He\nwill not grow weary. He has promised himself to recur frequently to this\nsubject. He will return to it. He will be as indefatigable in defending\nour historical edifices as our iconoclasts of the schools and academies\nare eager in attacking them; for it is a grievous thing to see into\nwhat hands the architecture of the Middle Ages has fallen, and in what a\nmanner the botchers of plaster of the present day treat the ruin of this\ngrand art, it is even a shame for us intelligent men who see them at\nwork and content ourselves with hooting them. And we are not speaking\nhere merely of what goes on in the provinces, but of what is done in\nParis at our very doors, beneath our windows, in the great city, in the\nlettered city, in the city of the press, of word, of thought. We cannot\nresist the impulse to point out, in concluding this note, some of\nthe acts of vandalism which are every day planned, debated, begun,\ncontinued, and successfully completed under the eyes of the artistic\npublic of Paris, face to face with criticism, which is disconcerted by\nso much audacity. An archbishop's palace has just been demolished, an\nedifice in poor taste, no great harm is done; but in a block with the\narchiepiscopal palace a bishop's palace has been demolished, a rare\nfragment of the fourteenth century, which the demolishing architect\ncould not distinguish from the rest. He has torn up the wheat with\nthe tares; 'tis all the same. They are talking of razing the\nadmirable chapel of Vincennes, in order to make, with its stones, some\nfortification, which Daumesnil did not need, however. While the Palais\nBourbon, that wretched edifice, is being repaired at great expense,\ngusts of wind and equinoctial storms are allowed to destroy the\nmagnificent painted windows of the Sainte-Chapelle. For the last few\ndays there has been a scaffolding on the tower of Saint Jacques de la\nBoucherie; and one of these mornings the pick will be laid to it. A\nmason has been found to build a little white house between the venerable\ntowers of the Palais de-Justice. Another has been found willing to prune\naway Saint-Germain-des-Pres, the feudal abbey with three bell towers.\nAnother will be found, no doubt, capable of pulling down Saint-Germain\nl'Auxerrois. All these masons claim to be architects, are paid by the\nprefecture or from the petty budget, and wear green coats. All the harm\nwhich false taste can inflict on good taste, they accomplish. While\nwe write, deplorable spectacle! one of them holds possession of the\nTuileries, one of them is giving Philibert Delorme a scar across the\nmiddle of his face; and it is not, assuredly, one of the least of the\nscandals of our time to see with what effrontery the heavy architecture\nof this gentleman is being flattened over one of the most delicate\nfa\u00c3\u00a7ades of the Renaissance!\n\nPARIS, October 20, 1832.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Notre-Dame de Paris, by Victor Hugo\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NOTRE-DAME DE PARIS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2610-8.txt or 2610-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/6\/1\/2610\/\n\nProduced by Peter Snow Cao\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1078,"split":"train"}
