Throughout the story Blackwood personifies the surrounding environment\u00e2\u0080\u0094river, sun, wind\u00e2\u0080\u0094and imbues them with a powerful and ultimately threatening character. Most ominous are the masses of dense, desultory, menacing willows, which \"moved of their own will as though alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen sense of the horrible.\" Just after managing to land their canoe for the evening on the shifting, sandy islands just downstream across the Austria\/Hungary frontier, the main character reflects on the river's potency, human qualities and will:\nSleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it became conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being, through all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its mighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendly and well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as a Great Personage.\nBlackwood also specifically characterizes the silvery, windblown willows as sinister:\nAnd, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly with my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their vast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the imagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether friendly to us.\nAt one point the two men see a man in a \"flat-bottomed boat\". However, the man appears to be warning the two, and ultimately crosses himself before hurtling forward on the river, out of sight. During the night and into the next day and night, the mysterious, hostile forces emerge in force, including large, dark shapes that seem to trace the consciousness of the two men, tapping sounds outside their tent, shifting gong-like sounds, and the appearance that the willows have changed location. In the morning the two discover that one of their two paddles is missing, there is a slit in the canoe that needs repair, and some of their food has disappeared. A hint of distrust arises between them. The howling wind dies down on the second day and night, and humming calm ensues. During the second night, the second man, the Swede, attempts to hurl himself into the river as a \"sacrifice,\" \"going inside to Them,\" but he is saved by the first character. The next morning, the Swede claims that the mysterious forces have found another sacrifice that may save them. They find the corpse of a peasant lodged in roots near the shore. When they touch the body, a flurry of living presence seems to rise from it and disappear into the sky, and later they see the body is pockmarked with funnel shapes as had been formed on the sands of the island during their experience. These are \"Their awful mark!\" the Swede says. The body is swept away, resembling an \"otter\" they thought they had seen the previous day, and the story ends.\nThe precise nature of the mysterious entities in \"The Willows\" is unclear, and they appear at times malevolent and treacherous, and at times simply mystical, almost divine: \"a new order of experience, and in the true sense of the word unearthly,\" and a world \"where great things go on unceasingly...vast purposes...that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly with mere expressions of the soul.\" These forces are also often contrasted with the fantastic natural beauty of the locale, itself a vigorous dynamic. In sum the story suggests that the landscape is an intersection, a point of contact with a \"fourth dimension\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 \"on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows.\"\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Willows, by Algernon Blackwood\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

On the big maps this deserted area is painted in a fluffy\nblue, growing fainter in color as it leaves the banks, and across it may be\nseen in large straggling letters the word Sumpfe, meaning marshes.\n\nIn high flood this great acreage of sand, shingle-beds, and willow-grown\nislands is almost topped by the water, but in normal seasons the bushes\nbend and rustle in the free winds, showing their silver leaves to the\nsunshine in an ever-moving plain of bewildering beauty. These willows never\nattain to the dignity of trees; they have no rigid trunks; they remain\nhumble bushes, with rounded tops and soft outline, swaying on slender stems\nthat answer to the least pressure of the wind; supple as grasses, and so\ncontinually shifting that they somehow give the impression that the entire\nplain is moving and alive. For the wind sends waves rising and falling over\nthe whole surface, waves of leaves instead of waves of water, green swells\nlike the sea, too, until the branches turn and lift, and then silvery white\nas their underside turns to the sun.\n\nHappy to slip beyond the control of the stern banks, the Danube here\nwanders about at will among the intricate network of channels intersecting\nthe islands everywhere with broad avenues down which the waters pour with a\nshouting sound; making whirlpools, eddies, and foaming rapids; tearing at\nthe sandy banks; carrying away masses of shore and willow-clumps; and\nforming new islands innumerably which shift daily in size and shape and\npossess at best an impermanent life, since the flood-time obliterates their\nvery existence.\n\nProperly speaking, this fascinating part of the river's life begins soon\nafter leaving Pressburg, and we, in our Canadian canoe, with gipsy tent and\nfrying-pan on board, reached it on the crest of a rising flood about\nmid-July. That very same morning, when the sky was reddening before\nsunrise, we had slipped swiftly through still-sleeping Vienna, leaving it a\ncouple of hours later a mere patch of smoke against the blue hills of the\nWienerwald on the horizon; we had breakfasted below Fischeramend under a\ngrove of birch trees roaring in the wind; and had then swept on the tearing\ncurrent past Orth, Hainburg, Petronell (the old Roman Carnuntum of Marcus\nAurelius), and so under the frowning heights of Thelsen on a spur of the\nCarpathians, where the March steals in quietly from the left and the\nfrontier is crossed between Austria and Hungary.\n\nRacing along at twelve kilometers an hour soon took us well into Hungary,\nand the muddy waters--sure sign of flood--sent us aground on many a\nshingle-bed, and twisted us like a cork in many a sudden belching whirlpool\nbefore the towers of Pressburg (Hungarian, Poszony) showed against the sky;\nand then the canoe, leaping like a spirited horse, flew at top speed under\nthe grey walls, negotiated safely the sunken chain of the Fliegende Brucke\nferry, turned the corner sharply to the left, and plunged on yellow foam\ninto the wilderness of islands, sandbanks, and swamp-land beyond--the land\nof the willows.\n\nThe change came suddenly, as when a series of bioscope pictures snaps down\non the streets of a town and shifts without warning into the scenery of\nlake and forest. We entered the land of desolation on wings, and in less\nthan half an hour there was neither boat nor fishing-hut nor red roof, nor\nany single sign of human habitation and civilization within sight. The\nsense of remoteness from the world of humankind, the utter isolation, the\nfascination of this singular world of willows, winds, and waters, instantly\nlaid its spell upon us both, so that we allowed laughingly to one another\nthat we ought by rights to have held some special kind of passport to admit\nus, and that we had, somewhat audaciously, come without asking leave into a\nseparate little kingdom of wonder and magic--a kingdom that was reserved\nfor the use of others who had a right to it, with everywhere unwritten\nwarnings to trespassers for those who had the imagination to discover them.\n\nThough still early in the afternoon, the ceaseless buffetings of a most\ntempestuous wind made us feel weary, and we at once began casting about for\na suitable camping-ground for the night. But the bewildering character of\nthe islands made landing difficult; the swirling flood carried us in shore\nand then swept us out again; the willow branches tore our hands as we\nseized them to stop the canoe, and we pulled many a yard of sandy bank into\nthe water before at length we shot with a great sideways blow from the wind\ninto a backwater and managed to beach the bows in a cloud of spray. Then we\nlay panting and laughing after our exertions on the hot yellow sand,\nsheltered from the wind, and in the full blaze of a scorching sun, a\ncloudless blue sky above, and an immense army of dancing, shouting willow\nbushes, closing in from all sides, shining with spray and clapping their\nthousand little hands as though to applaud the success of our efforts.\n\n\"What a river!\" I said to my companion, thinking of all the way we had\ntraveled from the source in the Black Forest, and how he had often been\nobliged to wade and push in the upper shallows at the beginning of June.\n\n\"Won't stand much nonsense now, will it?\" he said, pulling the canoe a\nlittle farther into safety up the sand, and then composing himself for a\nnap.\n\nI lay by his side, happy and peaceful in the bath of the elements--water,\nwind, sand, and the great fire of the sun--thinking of the long journey\nthat lay behind us, and of the great stretch before us to the Black Sea,\nand how lucky I was to have such a delightful and charming traveling\ncompanion as my friend, the Swede.\n\nWe had made many similar journeys together, but the Danube, more than any\nother river I knew, impressed us from the very beginning with its\naliveness. From its tiny bubbling entry into the world among the pinewood\ngardens of Donaueschingen, until this moment when it began to play the\ngreat river-game of losing itself among the deserted swamps, unobserved,\nunrestrained, it had seemed to us like following the grown of some living\ncreature. Sleepy at first, but later developing violent desires as it\nbecame conscious of its deep soul, it rolled, like some huge fluid being,\nthrough all the countries we had passed, holding our little craft on its\nmighty shoulders, playing roughly with us sometimes, yet always friendly\nand well-meaning, till at length we had come inevitably to regard it as a\nGreat Personage.\n\nHow, indeed, could it be otherwise, since it told us so much of its secret\nlife? At night we heard it singing to the moon as we lay in our tent,\nuttering that odd sibilant note peculiar to itself and said to be caused by\nthe rapid tearing of the pebbles along its bed, so great is its hurrying\nspeed. We knew, too, the voice of its gurgling whirlpools, suddenly\nbubbling up on a surface previously quite calm; the roar of its shallows\nand swift rapids; its constant steady thundering below all mere surface\nsounds; and that ceaseless tearing of its icy waters at the banks. How it\nstood up and shouted when the rains fell flat upon its face! And how its\nlaughter roared out when the wind blew up-stream and tried to stop its\ngrowing speed! We knew all its sounds and voices, its tumblings and\nfoamings, its unnecessary splashing against the bridges; that\nself-conscious chatter when there were hills to look on; the affected\ndignity of its speech when it passed through the little towns, far too\nimportant to laugh; and all these faint, sweet whisperings when the sun\ncaught it fairly in some slow curve and poured down upon it till the steam\nrose.\n\nIt was full of tricks, too, in its early life before the great world knew\nit. There were places in the upper reaches among the Swabian forests, when\nyet the first whispers of its destiny had not reached it, where it elected\nto disappear through holes in the ground, to appear again on the other side\nof the porous limestone hills and start a new river with another name;\nleaving, too, so little water in its own bed that we had to climb out and\nwade and push the canoe through miles of shallows.\n\nAnd a chief pleasure, in those early days of its irresponsible youth, was\nto lie low, like Brer Fox, just before the little turbulent tributaries\ncame to join it from the Alps, and to refuse to acknowledge them when in,\nbut to run for miles side by side, the dividing line well marked, the very\nlevels different, the Danube utterly declining to recognize the newcomer.\nBelow Passau, however, it gave up this particular trick, for there the Inn\ncomes in with a thundering power impossible to ignore, and so pushes and\nincommodes the parent river that there is hardly room for them in the long\ntwisting gorge that follows, and the Danube is shoved this way and that\nagainst the cliffs, and forced to hurry itself with great waves and much\ndashing to and fro in order to get through in time. And during the fight\nour canoe slipped down from its shoulder to its breast, and had the time of\nits life among the struggling waves. But the Inn taught the old river a\nlesson, and after Passau it no longer pretended to ignore new arrivals.\n\nThis was many days back, of course, and since then we had come to know\nother aspects of the great creature, and across the Bavarian wheat plain of\nStraubing she wandered so slowly under the blazing June sun that we could\nwell imagine only the surface inches were water, while below there moved,\nconcealed as by a silken mantle, a whole army of Undines, passing silently\nand unseen down to the sea, and very leisurely too, lest they be\ndiscovered.\n\nMuch, too, we forgave her because of her friendliness to the birds and\nanimals that haunted the shores. Cormorants lined the banks in lonely\nplaces in rows like short black palings; grey crows crowded the\nshingle-beds; storks stood fishing in the vistas of shallower water that\nopened up between the islands, and hawks, swans, and marsh birds of all\nsorts filled the air with glinting wings and singing, petulant cries. It\nwas impossible to feel annoyed with the river's vagaries after seeing a\ndeer leap with a splash into the water at sunrise and swim past the bows of\nthe canoe; and often we saw fawns peering at us from the underbrush, or\nlooked straight into the brown eyes of a stag as we charged full tilt round\na corner and entered another reach of the river. Foxes, too, everywhere\nhaunted the banks, tripping daintily among the driftwood and disappearing\nso suddenly that it was impossible to see how they managed it.\n\nBut now, after leaving Pressburg, everything changed a little, and the\nDanube became more serious. It ceased trifling. It was half-way to the\nBlack Sea, within seeming distance almost of other, stranger countries\nwhere no tricks would be permitted or understood. It became suddenly\ngrown-up, and claimed our respect and even our awe. It broke out into three\narms, for one thing, that only met again a hundred kilometers farther down,\nand for a canoe there were no indications which one was intended to be\nfollowed.\n\n\"If you take a side channel,\" said the Hungarian officer we met in the\nPressburg shop while buying provisions, \"you may find yourselves, when the\nflood subsides, forty miles from anywhere, high and dry, and you may easily\nstarve. There are no people, no farms, no fishermen. I warn you not to\ncontinue. The river, too, is still rising, and this wind will increase.\"\n\nThe rising river did not alarm us in the least, but the matter of being\nleft high and dry by a sudden subsidence of the waters might be serious,\nand we had consequently laid in an extra stock of provisions. For the rest,\nthe officer's prophecy held true, and the wind, blowing down a perfectly\nclear sky, increased steadily till it reached the dignity of a westerly\ngale.\n\nIt was earlier than usual when we camped, for the sun was a good hour or\ntwo from the horizon, and leaving my friend still asleep on the hot sand, I\nwandered about in desultory examination of our hotel. The island, I found,\nwas less than an acre in extent, a mere sandy bank standing some two or\nthree feet above the level of the river. The far end, pointing into the\nsunset, was covered with flying spray which the tremendous wind drove off\nthe crests of the broken waves. It was triangular in shape, with the apex\nup stream.\n\nI stood there for several minutes, watching the impetuous crimson flood\nbearing down with a shouting roar, dashing in waves against the bank as\nthough to sweep it bodily away, and then swirling by in two foaming streams\non either side. The ground seemed to shake with the shock and rush, while\nthe furious movement of the willow bushes as the wind poured over them\nincreased the curious illusion that the island itself actually moved.\nAbove, for a mile or two, I could see the great river descending upon me;\nit was like looking up the slope of a sliding hill, white with foam, and\nleaping up everywhere to show itself to the sun.\n\nThe rest of the island was too thickly grown with willows to make walking\npleasant, but I made the tour, nevertheless. From the lower end the light,\nof course, changed, and the river looked dark and angry. Only the backs of\nthe flying waves were visible, streaked with foam, and pushed forcibly by\nthe great puffs of wind that fell upon them from behind. For a short mile\nit was visible, pouring in and out among the islands, and then disappearing\nwith a huge sweep into the willows, which closed about it like a herd of\nmonstrous antediluvian creatures crowding down to drink. They made me think\nof gigantic sponge-like growths that sucked the river up into themselves.\nThey caused it to vanish from sight. They herded there together in such\noverpowering numbers.\n\nAltogether it was an impressive scene, with its utter loneliness, its\nbizarre suggestion; and as I gazed, long and curiously, a singular emotion\nbegan to stir somewhere in the depths of me. Midway in my delight of the\nwild beauty, there crept, unbidden and unexplained, a curious feeling of\ndisquietude, almost of alarm.\n\nA rising river, perhaps, always suggests something of the ominous; many of\nthe little islands I saw before me would probably have been swept away by\nthe morning; this resistless, thundering flood of water touched the sense\nof awe. Yet I was aware that my uneasiness lay deeper far than the emotions\nof awe and wonder. It was not that I felt. Nor had it directly to do with\nthe power of the driving wind--this shouting hurricane that might almost\ncarry up a few acres of willows into the air and scatter them like so much\nchaff over the landscape. The wind was simply enjoying itself, for nothing\nrose out of the flat landscape to stop it, and I was conscious of sharing\nits great game with a kind of pleasurable excitement. Yet this novel\nemotion had nothing to do with the wind. Indeed, so vague was the sense of\ndistress I experienced, that it was impossible to trace it to its source\nand deal with it accordingly, though I was aware somehow that it had to do\nwith my realization of our utter insignificance before this unrestrained\npower of the elements about me. The huge-grown river had something to do\nwith it too--a vague, unpleasant idea that we had somehow trifled with\nthese great elemental forces in whose power we lay helpless every hour of\nthe day and night. For here, indeed, they were gigantically at play\ntogether, and the sight appealed to the imagination.\n\nBut my emotion, so far as I could understand it, seemed to attach itself\nmore particularly to the willow bushes, to these acres and acres of\nwillows, crowding, so thickly growing there, swarming everywhere the eye\ncould reach, pressing upon the river as though to suffocate it, standing in\ndense array mile after mile beneath the sky, watching, waiting, listening.\nAnd, apart quite from the elements, the willows connected themselves subtly\nwith my malaise, attacking the mind insidiously somehow by reason of their\nvast numbers, and contriving in some way or other to represent to the\nimagination a new and mighty power, a power, moreover, not altogether\nfriendly to us.\n\nGreat revelations of nature, of course, never fail to impress in one way or\nanother, and I was no stranger to moods of the kind. Mountains overawe and\noceans terrify, while the mystery of great forests exercises a spell\npeculiarly its own. But all these, at one point or another, somewhere link\non intimately with human life and human experience. They stir\ncomprehensible, even if alarming, emotions. They tend on the whole to\nexalt.\n\nWith this multitude of willows, however, it was something far different, I\nfelt. Some essence emanated from them that besieged the heart. A sense of\nawe awakened, true, but of awe touched somewhere by a vague terror. Their\nserried ranks, growing everywhere darker about me as the shadows deepened,\nmoving furiously yet softly in the wind, woke in me the curious and\nunwelcome suggestion that we had trespassed here upon the borders of an\nalien world, a world where we were intruders, a world where we were not\nwanted or invited to remain--where we ran grave risks perhaps!\n\nThe feeling, however, though it refused to yield its meaning entirely to\nanalysis, did not at the time trouble me by passing into menace. Yet it\nnever left me quite, even during the very practical business of putting up\nthe tent in a hurricane of wind and building a fire for the stew-pot. It\nremained, just enough to bother and perplex, and to rob a most delightful\ncamping-ground of a good portion of its charm. To my companion, however, I\nsaid nothing, for he was a man I considered devoid of imagination. In the\nfirst place, I could never have explained to him what I meant, and in the\nsecond, he would have laughed stupidly at me if I had.\n\nThere was a slight depression in the center of the island, and here we\npitched the tent. The surrounding willows broke the wind a bit.\n\n\"A poor camp,\" observed the imperturbable Swede when at last the tent stood\nupright, \"no stones and precious little firewood. I'm for moving on early\ntomorrow--eh? This sand won't hold anything.\"\n\nBut the experience of a collapsing tent at midnight had taught us many\ndevices, and we made the cozy gipsy house as safe as possible, and then set\nabout collecting a store of wood to last till bed-time. Willow bushes drop\nno branches, and driftwood was our only source of supply. We hunted the\nshores pretty thoroughly. Everywhere the banks were crumbling as the rising\nflood tore at them and carried away great portions with a splash and a\ngurgle.\n\n\"The island's much smaller than when we landed,\" said the accurate Swede.\n\"It won't last long at this rate. We'd better drag the canoe close to the\ntent, and be ready to start at a moment's notice. I shall sleep in my\nclothes.\"\n\nHe was a little distance off, climbing along the bank, and I heard his\nrather jolly laugh as he spoke.\n\n\"By Jove!\" I heard him call, a moment later, and turned to see what had\ncaused his exclamation. But for the moment he was hidden by the willows,\nand I could not find him.\n\n\"What in the world's this?\" I heard him cry again, and this time his voice\nhad become serious.\n\nI ran up quickly and joined him on the bank. He was looking over the river,\npointing at something in the water.\n\n\"Good heavens, it's a man's body!\" he cried excitedly. \"Look!\"\n\nA black thing, turning over and over in the foaming waves, swept rapidly\npast. It kept disappearing and coming up to the surface again. It was about\ntwenty feet from the shore, and just as it was opposite to where we stood\nit lurched round and looked straight at us. We saw its eyes reflecting the\nsunset, and gleaming an odd yellow as the body turned over. Then it gave a\nswift, gulping plunge, and dived out of sight in a flash.\n\n\"An otter, by gad!\" we exclaimed in the same breath, laughing.\n\nIt was an otter, alive, and out on the hunt; yet it had looked exactly like\nthe body of a drowned man turning helplessly in the current. Far below it\ncame to the surface once again, and we saw its black skin, wet and shining\nin the sunlight.\n\nThen, too, just as we turned back, our arms full of driftwood, another\nthing happened to recall us to the river bank. This time it really was a\nman, and what was more, a man in a boat. Now a small boat on the Danube was\nan unusual sight at any time, but here in this deserted region, and at\nflood time, it was so unexpected as to constitute a real event. We stood\nand stared.\n\nWhether it was due to the slanting sunlight, or the refraction from the\nwonderfully illumined water, I cannot say, but, whatever the cause, I found\nit difficult to focus my sight properly upon the flying apparition. It\nseemed, however, to be a man standing upright in a sort of flat-bottomed\nboat, steering with a long oar, and being carried down the opposite shore\nat a tremendous pace. He apparently was looking across in our direction,\nbut the distance was too great and the light too uncertain for us to make\nout very plainly what he was about. It seemed to me that he was\ngesticulating and making signs at us. His voice came across the water to us\nshouting something furiously, but the wind drowned it so that no single\nword was audible. There was something curious about the whole\nappearance--man, boat, signs, voice--that made an impression on me out of\nall proportion to its cause.\n\n\"He's crossing himself!\" I cried. \"Look, he's making the sign of the\nCross!\"\n\n\"I believe you're right,\" the Swede said, shading his eyes with his hand\nand watching the man out of sight. He seemed to be gone in a moment,\nmelting away down there into the sea of willows where the sun caught them\nin the bend of the river and turned them into a great crimson wall of\nbeauty. Mist, too, had begun to ruse, so that the air was hazy.\n\n\"But what in the world is he doing at nightfall on this flooded river?\" I\nsaid, half to myself. \"Where is he going at such a time, and what did he\nmean by his signs and shouting? D'you think he wished to warn us about\nsomething?\"\n\n\"He saw our smoke, and thought we were spirits probably,\" laughed my\ncompanion. \"These Hungarians believe in all sorts of rubbish; you remember\nthe shopwoman at Pressburg warning us that no one ever landed here because\nit belonged to some sort of beings outside man's world! I suppose they\nbelieve in fairies and elementals, possibly demons, too. That peasant in\nthe boat saw people on the islands for the first time in his life,\" he\nadded, after a slight pause, \"and it scared him, that's all.\"\n\nThe Swede's tone of voice was not convincing, and his manner lacked\nsomething that was usually there. I noted the change instantly while he\ntalked, though without being able to label it precisely.\n\n\"If they had enough imagination,\" I laughed loudly--I remember trying to\nmake as much noise as I could--\"they might well people a place like this\nwith the old gods of antiquity. The Romans must have haunted all this\nregion more or less with their shrines and sacred groves and elemental\ndeities.\"\n\nThe subject dropped and we returned to our stew-pot, for my friend was not\ngiven to imaginative conversation as a rule. Moreover, just then I remember\nfeeling distinctly glad that he was not imaginative; his stolid, practical\nnature suddenly seemed to me welcome and comforting. It was an admirable\ntemperament, I felt; he could steer down rapids like a red Indian, shoot\ndangerous bridges and whirlpools better than any white man I ever saw in a\ncanoe. He was a grand fellow for an adventurous trip, a tower of strength\nwhen untoward things happened. I looked at his strong face and light curly\nhair as he staggered along under his pile of driftwood (twice the size of\nmine!), and I experienced a feeling of relief. Yes, I was distinctly glad\njust then that the Swede was--what he was, and that he never made remarks\nthat suggested more than they said.\n\n\"The river's still rising, though,\" he added, as if following out some\nthoughts of his own, and dropping his load with a gasp. \"This island will\nbe under water in two days if it goes on.\"\n\n\"I wish the wind would go down,\" I said. \"I don't care a fig for the\nriver.\"\n\nThe flood, indeed, had no terrors for us; we could get off at ten minutes'\nnotice, and the more water the better we liked it. It meant an increasing\ncurrent and the obliteration of the treacherous shingle-beds that so often\nthreatened to tear the bottom out of our canoe.\n\nContrary to our expectations, the wind did not go down with the sun. It\nseemed to increase with the darkness, howling overhead and shaking the\nwillows round us like straws. Curious sounds accompanied it sometimes, like\nthe explosion of heavy guns, and it fell upon the water and the island in\ngreat flat blows of immense power. It made me think of the sounds a planet\nmust make, could we only hear it, driving along through space.\n\nBut the sky kept wholly clear of clouds, and soon after supper the full\nmoon rose up in the east and covered the river and the plain of shouting\nwillows with a light like the day.\n\nWe lay on the sandy patch beside the fire, smoking, listening to the noises\nof the night round us, and talking happily of the journey we had already\nmade, and of our plans ahead. The map lay spread in the door of the tent,\nbut the high wind made it hard to study, and presently we lowered the\ncurtain and extinguished the lantern. The firelight was enough to smoke and\nsee each other's faces by, and the sparks flew about overhead like\nfireworks. A few yards beyond, the river gurgled and hissed, and from time\nto time a heavy splash announced the falling away of further portions of\nthe bank.\n\nOur talk, I noticed, had to do with the faraway scenes and incidents of our\nfirst camps in the Black Forest, or of other subjects altogether remote\nfrom the present setting, for neither of us spoke of the actual moment more\nthan was necessary--almost as though we had agreed tacitly to avoid\ndiscussion of the camp and its incidents. Neither the otter nor the\nboatman, for instance, received the honor of a single mention, though\nordinarily these would have furnished discussion for the greater part of\nthe evening. They were, of course, distinct events in such a place.\n\nThe scarcity of wood made it a business to keep the fire going, for the\nwind, that drove the smoke in our faces wherever we sat, helped at the same\ntime to make a forced draught. We took it in turn to make some foraging\nexpeditions into the darkness, and the quantity the Swede brought back\nalways made me feel that he took an absurdly long time finding it; for the\nfact was I did not care much about being left alone, and yet it always\nseemed to be my turn to grub about among the bushes or scramble along the\nslippery banks in the moonlight. The long day's battle with wind and\nwater--such wind and such water!--had tired us both, and an early bed was\nthe obvious program. Yet neither of us made the move for the tent. We lay\nthere, tending the fire, talking in desultory fashion, peering about us\ninto the dense willow bushes, and listening to the thunder of wind and\nriver. The loneliness of the place had entered our very bones, and silence\nseemed natural, for after a bit the sound of our voices became a trifle\nunreal and forced; whispering would have been the fitting mode of\ncommunication, I felt, and the human voice, always rather absurd amid the\nroar of the elements, now carried with it something almost illegitimate. It\nwas like talking out loud in church, or in some place where it was not\nlawful, perhaps not quite safe, to be overheard.\n\nThe eeriness of this lonely island, set among a million willows, swept by a\nhurricane, and surrounded by hurrying deep waters, touched us both, I\nfancy. Untrodden by man, almost unknown to man, it lay there beneath the\nmoon, remote from human influence, on the frontier of another world, an\nalien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows. And\nwe, in our rashness, had dared to invade it, even to make use of it!\nSomething more than the power of its mystery stirred in me as I lay on the\nsand, feet to fire, and peered up through the leaves at the stars. For the\nlast time I rose to get firewood.\n\n\"When this has burnt up,\" I said firmly, \"I shall turn in,\" and my\ncompanion watched me lazily as I moved off into the surrounding shadows.\n\nFor an unimaginative man I thought he seemed unusually receptive that\nnight, unusually open to suggestion of things other than sensory. He too\nwas touched by the beauty and loneliness of the place. I was not altogether\npleased, I remember, to recognize this slight change in him, and instead of\nimmediately collecting sticks, I made my way to the far point of the island\nwhere the moonlight on plain and river could be seen to better advantage.\nThe desire to be alone had come suddenly upon me; my former dread returned\nin force; there was a vague feeling in me I wished to face and probe to the\nbottom.\n\nWhen I reached the point of sand jutting out among the waves, the spell of\nthe place descended upon me with a positive shock. No mere \"scenery\" could\nhave produced such an effect. There was something more here, something to\nalarm.\n\nI gazed across the waste of wild waters; I watched the whispering willows;\nI heard the ceaseless beating of the tireless wind; and, one and all, each\nin its own way, stirred in me this sensation of a strange distress. But the\nwillows especially; for ever they went on chattering and talking among\nthemselves, laughing a little, shrilly crying out, sometimes sighing--but\nwhat it was they made so much to-do about belonged to the secret life of\nthe great plain they inhabited. And it was utterly alien to the world I\nknew, or to that of the wild yet kindly elements. They made me think of a\nhost of beings from another plane of life, another evolution altogether,\nperhaps, all discussing a mystery known only to themselves. I watched them\nmoving busily together, oddly shaking their big bushy heads, twirling their\nmyriad leaves even when there was no wind. They moved of their own will as\nthough alive, and they touched, by some incalculable method, my own keen\nsense of the horrible.\n\nThere they stood in the moonlight, like a vast army surrounding our camp,\nshaking their innumerable silver spears defiantly, formed all ready for an\nattack.\n\nThe psychology of places, for some imaginations at least, is very vivid;\nfor the wanderer, especially, camps have their \"note\" either of welcome or\nrejection. At first it may not always be apparent, because the busy\npreparations of tent and cooking prevent, but with the first pause--after\nsupper usually--it comes and announces itself. And the note of this\nwillow-camp now became unmistakably plain to me; we were interlopers,\ntrespassers; we were not welcomed. The sense of unfamiliarity grew upon me\nas I stood there watching. We touched the frontier of a region where our\npresence was resented. For a night's lodging we might perhaps be tolerated;\nbut for a prolonged and inquisitive stay--No! by all the gods of the trees\nand wilderness, no! We were the first human influences upon this island,\nand we were not wanted. The willows were against us.\n\nStrange thoughts like these, bizarre fancies, borne I know not whence,\nfound lodgment in my mind as I stood listening. What, I thought, if, after\nall, these crouching willows proved to be alive; if suddenly they should\nrise up, like a swarm of living creatures, marshaled by the gods whose\nterritory we had invaded, sweep towards us off the vast swamps, booming\noverhead in the night--and then settle down! As I looked it was so easy to\nimagine they actually moved, crept nearer, retreated a little, huddled\ntogether in masses, hostile, waiting for the great wind that should finally\nstart them a-running. I could have sworn their aspect changed a little, and\ntheir ranks deepened and pressed more closely together.\n\nThe melancholy shrill cry of a night-bird sounded overhead, and suddenly I\nnearly lost my balance as the piece of bank I stood upon fell with a great\nsplash into the river, undermined by the flood. I stepped back just in\ntime, and went on hunting for firewood again, half laughing at the odd\nfancies that crowded so thickly into my mind and cast their spell upon me.\nI recalled the Swede's remark about moving on next day, and I was just\nthinking that I fully agreed with him, when I turned with a start and saw\nthe subject of my thoughts standing immediately in front of me. He was\nquite close. The roar of the elements had covered his approach.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"You've been gone so long,\" he shouted above the wind, \"I thought something\nmust have happened to you.\"\n\nBut there was that in his tone, and a certain look in his face as well,\nthat conveyed to me more than his usual words, and in a flash I understood\nthe real reason for his coming. It was because the spell of the place had\nentered his soul too, and he did not like being alone.\n\n\"River still rising,\" he cried, pointing to the flood in the moonlight,\n\"and the wind's simply awful.\"\n\nHe always said the same things, but it was the cry for companionship that\ngave the real importance to his words.\n\n\"Lucky,\" I cried back, \"our tent's in the hollow. I think it'll hold all\nright.\" I added something about the difficulty of finding wood, in order to\nexplain my absence, but the wind caught my words and flung them across the\nriver, so that he did not hear, but just looked at me through the branches,\nnodding his head.\n\n\"Lucky if we get away without disaster!\" he shouted, or words to that\neffect; and I remember feeling half angry with him for putting the thought\ninto words, for it was exactly what I felt myself. There was disaster\nimpending somewhere, and the sense of presentiment lay unpleasantly upon\nme.\n\nWe went back to the fire and made a final blaze, poking it up with our\nfeet. We took a last look round. But for the wind the heat would have been\nunpleasant. I put this thought into words, and I remember my friend's reply\nstruck me oddly: that he would rather have the heat, the ordinary July\nweather, than this \"diabolical wind.\"\n\nEverything was snug for the night; the canoe lying turned over beside the\ntent, with both yellow paddles beneath her; the provision sack hanging from\na willow-stem, and the washed-up dishes removed to a safe distance from the\nfire, all ready for the morning meal.\n\nWe smothered the embers of the fire with sand, and then turned in. The flap\nof the tent door was up, and I saw the branches and the stars and the white\nmoonlight. The shaking willows and the heavy buffetings of the wind against\nour taut little house were the last things I remembered as sleep came down\nand covered all with its soft and delicious forgetfulness.\n\nSuddenly I found myself lying awake, peering from my sandy mattress through\nthe door of the tent. I looked at my watch pinned against the canvas, and\nsaw by the bright moonlight that it was past twelve o'clock--the threshold\nof a new day--and I had therefore slept a couple of hours. The Swede was\nasleep still beside me; the wind howled as before; something plucked at my\nheart and made me feel afraid. There was a sense of disturbance in my\nimmediate neighborhood.\n\nI sat up quickly and looked out. The trees were swaying violently to and\nfro as the gusts smote them, but our little bit of green canvas lay snugly\nsafe in the hollow, for the wind passed over it without meeting enough\nresistance to make it vicious. The feeling of disquietude did not pass,\nhowever, and I crawled quietly out of the tent to see if our belongings\nwere safe. I moved carefully so as not to waken my companion. A curious\nexcitement was on me.\n\nI was half-way out, kneeling on all fours, when my eye first took in that\nthe tops of the bushes opposite, with their moving tracery of leaves, made\nshapes against the sky. I sat back on my haunches and stared. It was\nincredible, surely, but there, opposite and slightly above me, were shapes\nof some indeterminate sort among the willows, and as the branches swayed in\nthe wind they seemed to group themselves about these shapes, forming a\nseries of monstrous outlines that shifted rapidly beneath the moon. Close,\nabout fifty feet in front of me, I saw these things.\n\nMy first instinct was to waken my companion, that he too might see them,\nbut something made me hesitate--the sudden realization, probably, that I\nshould not welcome corroboration; and meanwhile I crouched there staring in\namazement with smarting eyes. I was wide awake. I remember saying to myself\nthat I was not dreaming.\n\nThey first became properly visible, these huge figures, just within the\ntops of the bushes--immense, bronze-colored, moving, and wholly independent\nof the swaying of the branches. I saw them plainly and noted, now I came to\nexamine them more calmly, that they were very much larger than human, and\nindeed that something in their appearance proclaimed them to be not human\nat all. Certainly they were not merely the moving tracery of the branches\nagainst the moonlight. They shifted independently. They rose upwards in a\ncontinuous stream from earth to sky, vanishing utterly as soon as they\nreached the dark of the sky. They were interlaced one with another, making\na great column, and I saw their limbs and huge bodies melting in and out of\neach other, forming this serpentine line that bent and swayed and twisted\nspirally with the contortions of the wind-tossed trees. They were nude,\nfluid shapes, passing up the bushes, within the leaves almost--rising up in\na living column into the heavens. Their faces I never could see.\nUnceasingly they poured upwards, swaying in great bending curves, with a\nhue of dull bronze upon their skins.\n\nI stared, trying to force every atom of vision from my eyes. For a long\ntime I thought they must every moment disappear and resolve themselves into\nthe movements of the branches and prove to be an optical illusion. I\nsearched everywhere for a proof of reality, when all the while I understood\nquite well that the standard of reality had changed. For the longer I\nlooked the more certain I became that these figures were real and living,\nthough perhaps not according to the standards that the camera and the\nbiologist would insist upon.\n\nFar from feeling fear, I was possessed with a sense of awe and wonder such\nas I have never known. I seemed to be gazing at the personified elemental\nforces of this haunted and primeval region. Our intrusion had stirred the\npowers of the place into activity. It was we who were the cause of the\ndisturbance, and my brain filled to bursting with stories and legends of\nthe spirits and deities of places that have been acknowledged and\nworshipped by men in all ages of the world's history. But, before I could\narrive at any possible explanation, something impelled me to go farther\nout, and I crept forward on the sand and stood upright. I felt the ground\nstill warm under my bare feet; the wind tore at my hair and face; and the\nsound of the river burst upon my ears with a sudden roar. These things, I\nknew, were real, and proved that my senses were acting normally. Yet the\nfigures still rose from earth to heaven, silent, majestically, in a great\nspiral of grace and strength that overwhelmed me at length with a genuine\ndeep emotion of worship. I felt that I must fall down and\nworship--absolutely worship.\n\nPerhaps in another minute I might have done so, when a gust of wind swept\nagainst me with such force that it blew me sideways, and I nearly stumbled\nand fell. It seemed to shake the dream violently out of me. At least it\ngave me another point of view somehow. The figures still remained, still\nascended into heaven from the heart of the night, but my reason at last\nbegan to assert itself. It must be a subjective experience, I argued--none\nthe less real for that, but still subjective. The moonlight and the\nbranches combined to work out these pictures upon the mirror of my\nimagination, and for some reason I projected them outwards and made them\nappear objective. I knew this must be the case, of course. I took courage,\nand began to move forward across the open patches of sand. By Jove, though,\nwas it all hallucination? Was it merely subjective? Did not my reason argue\nin the old futile way from the little standard of the known?\n\nI only know that great column of figures ascended darkly into the sky for\nwhat seemed a very long period of time, and with a very complete measure of\nreality as most men are accustomed to gauge reality. Then suddenly they\nwere gone!\n\nAnd, once they were gone and the immediate wonder of their great presence\nhad passed, fear came down upon me with a cold rush. The esoteric meaning\nof this lonely and haunted region suddenly flamed up within me, and I began\nto tremble dreadfully. I took a quick look round--a look of horror that\ncame near to panic--calculating vainly ways of escape; and then, realizing\nhow helpless I was to achieve anything really effective, I crept back\nsilently into the tent and lay down again upon my sandy mattress, first\nlowering the door-curtain to shut out the sight of the willows in the\nmoonlight, and then burying my head as deeply as possible beneath the\nblankets to deaden the sound of the terrifying wind.\n\nAs though further to convince me that I had not been dreaming, I remember\nthat it was a long time before I fell again into a troubled and restless\nsleep; and even then only the upper crust of me slept, and underneath there\nwas something that never quite lost consciousness, but lay alert and on the\nwatch.\n\nBut this second time I jumped up with a genuine start of terror. It was\nneither the wind nor the river that woke me, but the slow approach of\nsomething that caused the sleeping portion of me to grow smaller and\nsmaller till at last it vanished altogether, and I found myself sitting\nbolt upright--listening.\n\nOutside there was a sound of multitudinous little patterings. They had been\ncoming, I was aware, for a long time, and in my sleep they had first become\naudible. I sat there nervously wide awake as though I had not slept at all.\nIt seemed to me that my breathing came with difficulty, and that there was\na great weight upon the surface of my body. In spite of the hot night, I\nfelt clammy with cold and shivered. Something surely was pressing steadily\nagainst the sides of the tent and weighing down upon it from above. Was it\nthe body of the wind? Was this the pattering rain, the dripping of the\nleaves? The spray blown from the river by the wind and gathering in big\ndrops? I thought quickly of a dozen things.\n\nThen suddenly the explanation leaped into my mind: a bough from the poplar,\nthe only large tree on the island, had fallen with the wind. Still half\ncaught by the other branches, it would fall with the next gust and crush\nus, and meanwhile its leaves brushed and tapped upon the tight canvas\nsurface of the tent. I raised a loose flap and rushed out, calling to the\nSwede to follow.\n\nBut when I got out and stood upright I saw that the tent was free. There\nwas no hanging bough; there was no rain or spray; nothing approached.\n\nA cold, grey light filtered down through the bushes and lay on the faintly\ngleaming sand. Stars still crowded the sky directly overhead, and the wind\nhowled magnificently, but the fire no longer gave out any glow, and I saw\nthe east reddening in streaks through the trees. Several hours must have\npassed since I stood there before watching the ascending figures, and the\nmemory of it now came back to me horribly, like an evil dream. Oh, how\ntired it made me feel, that ceaseless raging wind! Yet, though the deep\nlassitude of a sleepless night was on me, my nerves were tingling with the\nactivity of an equally tireless apprehension, and all idea of repose was\nout of the question. The river I saw had risen further. Its thunder filled\nthe air, and a fine spray made itself felt through my thin sleeping shirt.\n\nYet nowhere did I discover the slightest evidence of anything to cause\nalarm. This deep, prolonged disturbance in my heart remained wholly\nunaccounted for.\n\nMy companion had not stirred when I called him, and there was no need to\nwaken him now. I looked about me carefully, noting everything; the\nturned-over canoe; the yellow paddles--two of them, I'm certain; the\nprovision sack and the extra lantern hanging together from the tree; and,\ncrowding everywhere about me, enveloping all, the willows, those endless,\nshaking willows. A bird uttered its morning cry, and a string of duck\npassed with whirring flight overhead in the twilight. The sand whirled, dry\nand stinging, about my bare feet in the wind.\n\nI walked round the tent and then went out a little way into the bush, so\nthat I could see across the river to the farther landscape, and the same\nprofound yet indefinable emotion of distress seized upon me again as I saw\nthe interminable sea of bushes stretching to the horizon, looking ghostly\nand unreal in the wan light of dawn. I walked softly here and there, still\npuzzling over that odd sound of infinite pattering, and of that pressure\nupon the tent that had wakened me. It must have been the wind, I\nreflected--the wind bearing upon the loose, hot sand, driving the dry\nparticles smartly against the taut canvas--the wind dropping heavily upon\nour fragile roof.\n\nYet all the time my nervousness and malaise increased appreciably.\n\nI crossed over to the farther shore and noted how the coast-line had\naltered in the night, and what masses of sand the river had torn away. I\ndipped my hands and feet into the cool current, and bathed my forehead.\nAlready there was a glow of sunrise in the sky and the exquisite freshness\nof coming day. On my way back I passed purposely beneath the very bushes\nwhere I had seen the column of figures rising into the air, and midway\namong the clumps I suddenly found myself overtaken by a sense of vast\nterror. From the shadows a large figure went swiftly by. Someone passed me,\nas sure as ever man did....\n\nIt was a great staggering blow from the wind that helped me forward again,\nand once out in the more open space, the sense of terror diminished\nstrangely. The winds were about and walking, I remember saying to myself,\nfor the winds often move like great presences under the trees. And\naltogether the fear that hovered about me was such an unknown and immense\nkind of fear, so unlike anything I had ever felt before, that it woke a\nsense of awe and wonder in me that did much to counteract its worst\neffects; and when I reached a high point in the middle of the island from\nwhich I could see the wide stretch of river, crimson in the sunrise, the\nwhole magical beauty of it all was so overpowering that a sort of wild\nyearning woke in me and almost brought a cry up into the throat.\n\nBut this cry found no expression, for as my eyes wandered from the plain\nbeyond to the island round me and noted our little tent half hidden among\nthe willows, a dreadful discovery leaped out at me, compared to which my\nterror of the walking winds seemed as nothing at all.\n\nFor a change, I thought, had somehow come about in the arrangement of the\nlandscape. It was not that my point of vantage gave me a different view,\nbut that an alteration had apparently been effected in the relation of the\ntent to the willows, and of the willows to the tent. Surely the bushes now\ncrowded much closer--unnecessarily, unpleasantly close. They had moved\nnearer.\n\nCreeping with silent feet over the shifting sands, drawing imperceptibly\nnearer by soft, unhurried movements, the willows had come closer during the\nnight. But had the wind moved them, or had they moved of themselves? I\nrecalled the sound of infinite small patterings and the pressure upon the\ntent and upon my own heart that caused me to wake in terror. I swayed for a\nmoment in the wind like a tree, finding it hard to keep my upright position\non the sandy hillock. There was a suggestion here of personal agency, of\ndeliberate intention, of aggressive hostility, and it terrified me into a\nsort of rigidity.\n\nThen the reaction followed quickly. The idea was so bizarre, so absurd,\nthat I felt inclined to laugh. But the laughter came no more readily than\nthe cry, for the knowledge that my mind was so receptive to such dangerous\nimaginings brought the additional terror that it was through our minds and\nnot through our physical bodies that the attack would come, and was coming.\n\nThe wind buffeted me about, and, very quickly it seemed, the sun came up\nover the horizon, for it was after four o'clock, and I must have stood on\nthat little pinnacle of sand longer than I knew, afraid to come down to\nclose quarters with the willows. I returned quietly, creepily, to the tent,\nfirst taking another exhaustive look round and--yes, I confess it--making a\nfew measurements. I paced out on the warm sand the distances between the\nwillows and the tent, making a note of the shortest distance particularly.\n\nI crawled stealthily into my blankets. My companion, to all appearances,\nstill slept soundly, and I was glad that this was so. Provided my\nexperiences were not corroborated, I could find strength somehow to deny\nthem, perhaps. With the daylight I could persuade myself that it was all a\nsubjective hallucination, a fantasy of the night, a projection of the\nexcited imagination.\n\nNothing further came in to disturb me, and I fell asleep almost at once,\nutterly exhausted, yet still in dread of hearing again that weird sound of\nmultitudinous pattering, or of feeling the pressure upon my heart that had\nmade it difficult to breathe.\n\nThe sun was high in the heavens when my companion woke me from a heavy\nsleep and announced that the porridge was cooked and there was just time to\nbathe. The grateful smell of frizzling bacon entered the tent door.\n\n\"River still rising,\" he said, \"and several islands out in mid-stream have\ndisappeared altogether. Our own island's much smaller.\"\n\n\"Any wood left?\" I asked sleepily.\n\n\"The wood and the island will finish tomorrow in a dead heat,\" he laughed,\n\"but there's enough to last us till then.\"\n\nI plunged in from the point of the island, which had indeed altered a lot\nin size and shape during the night, and was swept down in a moment to the\nlanding-place opposite the tent. The water was icy, and the banks flew by\nlike the country from an express train. Bathing under such conditions was\nan exhilarating operation, and the terror of the night seemed cleansed out\nof me by a process of evaporation in the brain. The sun was blazing hot;\nnot a cloud showed itself anywhere; the wind, however, had not abated one\nlittle jot.\n\nQuite suddenly then the implied meaning of the Swede's words flashed across\nme, showing that he no longer wished to leave post-haste, and had changed\nhis mind. \"Enough to last till tomorrow\"--he assumed we should stay on the\nisland another night. It struck me as odd. The night before he was so\npositive the other way. How had the change come about?\n\nGreat crumblings of the banks occurred at breakfast, with heavy splashings\nand clouds of spray which the wind brought into our frying-pan, and my\nfellow-traveler talked incessantly about the difficulty the Vienna-Pesth\nsteamers must have to find the channel in flood. But the state of his mind\ninterested and impressed me far more than the state of the river or the\ndifficulties of the steamers. He had changed somehow since the evening\nbefore. His manner was different--a trifle excited, a trifle shy, with a\nsort of suspicion about his voice and gestures. I hardly know how to\ndescribe it now in cold blood, but at the time I remember being quite\ncertain of one thing--that he had become frightened?\n\nHe ate very little breakfast, and for once omitted to smoke his pipe. He\nhad the map spread open beside him, and kept studying its markings.\n\n\"We'd better get off sharp in an hour,\" I said presently, feeling for an\nopening that must bring him indirectly to a partial confession at any rate.\nAnd his answer puzzled me uncomfortably: \"Rather! If they'll let us.\"\n\n\"Who'll let us? The elements?\" I asked quickly, with affected indifference.\n\n\"The powers of this awful place, whoever they are,\" he replied, keeping his\neyes on the map. \"The gods are here, if they are anywhere at all in the\nworld.\"\n\n\"The elements are always the true immortals,\" I replied, laughing as\nnaturally as I could manage, yet knowing quite well that my face reflected\nmy true feelings when he looked up gravely at me and spoke across the\nsmoke:\n\n\"We shall be fortunate if we get away without further disaster.\"\n\nThis was exactly what I had dreaded, and I screwed myself up to the point\nof the direct question. It was like agreeing to allow the dentist to\nextract the tooth; it had to come anyhow in the long run, and the rest was\nall pretence.\n\n\"Further disaster! Why, what's happened?\"\n\n\"For one thing--the steering paddle's gone,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"The steering paddle gone!\" I repeated, greatly excited, for this was our\nrudder, and the Danube in flood without a rudder was suicide. \"But what--\"\n\n\"And there's a tear in the bottom of the canoe,\" he added, with a genuine\nlittle tremor in his voice.\n\nI continued staring at him, able only to repeat the words in his face\nsomewhat foolishly. There, in the heat of the sun, and on this burning\nsand, I was aware of a freezing atmosphere descending round us. I got up to\nfollow him, for he merely nodded his head gravely and led the way towards\nthe tent a few yards on the other side of the fireplace. The canoe still\nlay there as I had last seen her in the night, ribs uppermost, the paddles,\nor rather, the paddle, on the sand beside her.\n\n\"There's only one,\" he said, stooping to pick it up. \"And here's the rent\nin the base-board.\"\n\nIt was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that I had clearly noticed two\npaddles a few hours before, but a second impulse made me think better of\nit, and I said nothing. I approached to see.\n\nThere was a long, finely made tear in the bottom of the canoe where a\nlittle slither of wood had been neatly taken clean out; it looked as if the\ntooth of a sharp rock or snag had eaten down her length, and investigation\nshowed that the hole went through. Had we launched out in her without\nobserving it we must inevitably have foundered. At first the water would\nhave made the wood swell so as to close the hole, but once out in\nmid-stream the water must have poured in, and the canoe, never more than\ntwo inches above the surface, would have filled and sunk very rapidly.\n\n\"There, you see an attempt to prepare a victim for the sacrifice,\" I heard\nhim saying, more to himself than to me, \"two victims rather,\" he added as\nhe bent over and ran his fingers along the slit.\n\nI began to whistle--a thing I always do unconsciously when utterly\nnonplussed--and purposely paid no attention to his words. I was determined\nto consider them foolish.\n\n\"It wasn't there last night,\" he said presently, straightening up from his\nexamination and looking anywhere but at me.\n\n\"We must have scratched her in landing, of course,\" I stopped whistling to\nsay. \"The stones are very sharp.\"\n\nI stopped abruptly, for at that moment he turned round and met my eye\nsquarely. I knew just as well as he did how impossible my explanation was.\nThere were no stones, to begin with.\n\n\"And then there's this to explain too,\" he added quietly, handing me the\npaddle and pointing to the blade.\n\nA new and curious emotion spread freezingly over me as I took and examined\nit. The blade was scraped down all over, beautifully scraped, as though\nsomeone had sand-papered it with care, making it so thin that the first\nvigorous stroke must have snapped it off at the elbow.\n\n\"One of us walked in his sleep and did this thing,\" I said feebly, \"or--or\nit has been filed by the constant stream of sand particles blown against it\nby the wind, perhaps.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said the Swede, turning away, laughing a little, \"you can explain\neverything.\"\n\n\"The same wind that caught the steering paddle and flung it so near the\nbank that it fell in with the next lump that crumbled,\" I called out after\nhim, absolutely determined to find an explanation for everything he showed\nme.\n\n\"I see,\" he shouted back, turning his head to look at me before\ndisappearing among the willow bushes.\n\nOnce alone with these perplexing evidences of personal agency, I think my\nfirst thoughts took the form of \"One of us must have done this thing, and\nit certainly was not I.\" But my second thought decided how impossible it\nwas to suppose, under all the circumstances, that either of us had done it.\nThat my companion, the trusted friend of a dozen similar expeditions, could\nhave knowingly had a hand in it, was a suggestion not to be entertained for\na moment. Equally absurd seemed the explanation that this imperturbable and\ndensely practical nature had suddenly become insane and was busied with\ninsane purposes.\n\nYet the fact remained that what disturbed me most, and kept my fear\nactively alive even in this blaze of sunshine and wild beauty, was the\nclear certainty that some curious alteration had come about in his\nmind--that he was nervous, timid, suspicious, aware of goings on he did not\nspeak about, watching a series of secret and hitherto unmentionable\nevents--waiting, in a word, for a climax that he expected, and, I thought,\nexpected very soon. This grew up in my mind intuitively--I hardly knew how.\n\nI made a hurried examination of the tent and its surroundings, but the\nmeasurements of the night remained the same. There were deep hollows formed\nin the sand I now noticed for the first time, basin-shaped and of various\ndepths and sizes, varying from that of a tea-cup to a large bowl. The wind,\nno doubt, was responsible for these miniature craters, just as it was for\nlifting the paddle and tossing it towards the water. The rent in the canoe\nwas the only thing that seemed quite inexplicable; and, after all, it was\nconceivable that a sharp point had caught it when we landed. The\nexamination I made of the shore did not assist this theory, but all the\nsame I clung to it with that diminishing portion of my intelligence which I\ncalled my \"reason.\" An explanation of some kind was an absolute necessity,\njust as some working explanation of the universe is necessary--however\nabsurd--to the happiness of every individual who seeks to do his duty in\nthe world and face the problems of life. The simile seemed to me at the\ntime an exact parallel.\n\nI at once set the pitch melting, and presently the Swede joined me at the\nwork, though under the best conditions in the world the canoe could not be\nsafe for traveling till the following day. I drew his attention casually to\nthe hollows in the sand.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I know. They're all over the island. But you can explain\nthem, no doubt!\"\n\n\"Wind, of course,\" I answered without hesitation. \"Have you never watched\nthose little whirlwinds in the street that twist and twirl everything into\na circle? This sand's loose enough to yield, that's all.\"\n\nHe made no reply, and we worked on in silence for a bit. I watched him\nsurreptitiously all the time, and I had an idea he was watching me. He\nseemed, too, to be always listening attentively to something I could not\nhear, or perhaps for something that he expected to hear, for he kept\nturning about and staring into the bushes, and up into the sky, and out\nacross the water where it was visible through the openings among the\nwillows. Sometimes he even put his hand to his ear and held it there for\nseveral minutes. He said nothing to me, however, about it, and I asked no\nquestions. And meanwhile, as he mended that torn canoe with the skill and\naddress of a red Indian, I was glad to notice his absorption in the work,\nfor there was a vague dread in my heart that he would speak of the changed\naspect of the willows. And, if he had noticed that, my imagination could no\nlonger be held a sufficient explanation of it.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nAt length, after a long pause, he began to talk.\n\n\"Queer thing,\" he added in a hurried sort of voice, as though he wanted to\nsay something and get it over. \"Queer thing. I mean, about that otter last\nnight.\"\n\nI had expected something so totally different that he caught me with\nsurprise, and I looked up sharply.\n\n\"Shows how lonely this place is. Otters are awfully shy things--\"\n\n\"I don't mean that, of course,\" he interrupted. \"I mean--do you think--did\nyou think it really was an otter?\"\n\n\"What else, in the name of Heaven, what else?\"\n\n\"You know, I saw it before you did, and at first it seemed--so much bigger\nthan an otter.\"\n\n\"The sunset as you looked up-stream magnified it, or something,\" I replied.\n\nHe looked at me absently a moment, as though his mind were busy with other\nthoughts.\n\n\"It had such extraordinary yellow eyes,\" he went on half to himself.\n\n\"That was the sun too,\" I laughed, a trifle boisterously. \"I suppose you'll\nwonder next if that fellow in the boat--\"\n\nI suddenly decided not to finish the sentence. He was in the act again of\nlistening, turning his head to the wind, and something in the expression of\nhis face made me halt. The subject dropped, and we went on with our\ncaulking. Apparently he had not noticed my unfinished sentence. Five\nminutes later, however, he looked at me across the canoe, the smoking pitch\nin his hand, his face exceedingly grave.\n\n\"I did rather wonder, if you want to know,\" he said slowly, \"what that\nthing in the boat was. I remember thinking at the time it was not a man.\nThe whole business seemed to rise quite suddenly out of the water.\"\n\nI laughed again boisterously in his face, but this time there was\nimpatience, and a strain of anger too, in my feeling.\n\n\"Look here now,\" I cried, \"this place is quite queer enough without going\nout of our way to imagine things! That boat was an ordinary boat, and the\nman in it was an ordinary man, and they were both going down-stream as fast\nas they could lick. And that otter was an otter, so don't let's play the\nfool about it!\"\n\nHe looked steadily at me with the same grave expression. He was not in the\nleast annoyed. I took courage from his silence.\n\n\"And, for Heaven's sake,\" I went on, \"don't keep pretending you hear\nthings, because it only gives me the jumps, and there's nothing to hear but\nthe river and this cursed old thundering wind.\"\n\n\"You fool!\" he answered in a low, shocked voice, \"you utter fool. That's\njust the way all victims talk. As if you didn't understand just as well as\nI do!\" he sneered with scorn in his voice, and a sort of resignation. \"The\nbest thing you can do is to keep quiet and try to hold your mind as firm as\npossible. This feeble attempt at self-deception only makes the truth harder\nwhen you're forced to meet it.\"\n\nMy little effort was over, and I found nothing more to say, for I knew\nquite well his words were true, and that I was the fool, not he. Up to a\ncertain stage in the adventure he kept ahead of me easily, and I think I\nfelt annoyed to be out of it, to be thus proved less psychic, less\nsensitive than himself to these extraordinary happenings, and half ignorant\nall the time of what was going on under my very nose. He knew from the very\nbeginning, apparently. But at the moment I wholly missed the point of his\nwords about the necessity of there being a victim, and that we ourselves\nwere destined to satisfy the want. I dropped all pretence thenceforward,\nbut thenceforward likewise my fear increased steadily to the climax.\n\n\"But you're quite right about one thing,\" he added, before the subject\npassed, \"and that is that we're wiser not to talk about it, or even to\nthink about it, because what one thinks finds expression in words, and what\none says, happens.\"\n\nThat afternoon, while the canoe dried and hardened, we spent trying to\nfish, testing the leak, collecting wood, and watching the enormous flood of\nrising water. Masses of driftwood swept near our shores sometimes, and we\nfished for them with long willow branches. The island grew perceptibly\nsmaller as the banks were torn away with great gulps and splashes. The\nweather kept brilliantly fine till about four o'clock, and then for the\nfirst time for three days the wind showed signs of abating. Clouds began to\ngather in the south-west, spreading thence slowly over the sky.\n\nThis lessening of the wind came as a great relief, for the incessant\nroaring, banging, and thundering had irritated our nerves. Yet the silence\nthat came about five o'clock with its sudden cessation was in a manner\nquite as oppressive. The booming of the river had everything in its own way\nthen; it filled the air with deep murmurs, more musical than the wind\nnoises, but infinitely more monotonous. The wind held many notes, rising,\nfalling always beating out some sort of great elemental tune; whereas the\nriver's song lay between three notes at most--dull pedal notes, that held a\nlugubrious quality foreign to the wind, and somehow seemed to me, in my\nthen nervous state, to sound wonderfully well the music of doom.\n\nIt was extraordinary, too, how the withdrawal suddenly of bright sunlight\ntook everything out of the landscape that made for cheerfulness; and since\nthis particular landscape had already managed to convey the suggestion of\nsomething sinister, the change of course was all the more unwelcome and\nnoticeable. For me, I know, the darkening outlook became distinctly more\nalarming, and I found myself more than once calculating how soon after\nsunset the full moon would get up in the east, and whether the gathering\nclouds would greatly interfere with her lighting of the little island.\n\nWith this general hush of the wind--though it still indulged in occasional\nbrief gusts--the river seemed to me to grow blacker, the willows to stand\nmore densely together. The latter, too, kept up a sort of independent\nmovement of their own, rustling among themselves when no wind stirred, and\nshaking oddly from the roots upwards. When common objects in this way be\ncome charged with the suggestion of horror, they stimulate the imagination\nfar more than things of unusual appearance; and these bushes, crowding\nhuddled about us, assumed for me in the darkness a bizarre grotesquerie of\nappearance that lent to them somehow the aspect of purposeful and living\ncreatures. Their very ordinariness, I felt, masked what was malignant and\nhostile to us. The forces of the region drew nearer with the coming of\nnight. They were focusing upon our island, and more particularly upon\nourselves. For thus, somehow, in the terms of the imagination, did my\nreally indescribable sensations in this extraordinary place present\nthemselves.\n\nI had slept a good deal in the early afternoon, and had thus recovered\nsomewhat from the exhaustion of a disturbed night, but this only served\napparently to render me more susceptible than before to the obsessing spell\nof the haunting. I fought against it, laughing at my feelings as absurd and\nchildish, with very obvious physiological explanations, yet, in spite of\nevery effort, they gained in strength upon me so that I dreaded the night\nas a child lost in a forest must dread the approach of darkness.\n\nThe canoe we had carefully covered with a waterproof sheet during the day,\nand the one remaining paddle had been securely tied by the Swede to the\nbase of a tree, lest the wind should rob us of that too. From five o'clock\nonwards I busied myself with the stew-pot and preparations for dinner, it\nbeing my turn to cook that night. We had potatoes, onions, bits of bacon\nfat to add flavor, and a general thick residue from former stews at the\nbottom of the pot; with black bread broken up into it the result was most\nexcellent, and it was followed by a stew of plums with sugar and a brew of\nstrong tea with dried milk. A good pile of wood lay close at hand, and the\nabsence of wind made my duties easy. My companion sat lazily watching me,\ndividing his attentions between cleaning his pipe and giving useless\nadvice--an admitted privilege of the off-duty man. He had been very quiet\nall the afternoon, engaged in re-caulking the canoe, strengthening the tent\nropes, and fishing for driftwood while I slept. No more talk about\nundesirable things had passed between us, and I think his only remarks had\nto do with the gradual destruction of the island, which he declared was not\nfully a third smaller than when we first landed.\n\nThe pot had just begun to bubble when I heard his voice calling to me from\nthe bank, where he had wandered away without my noticing. I ran up.\n\n\"Come and listen,\" he said, \"and see what you make of it.\" He held his hand\ncupwise to his ear, as so often before.\n\n\"Now do you hear anything?\" he asked, watching me curiously.\n\nWe stood there, listening attentively together. At first I heard only the\ndeep note of the water and the hissings rising from its turbulent surface.\nThe willows, for once, were motionless and silent. Then a sound began to\nreach my ears faintly, a peculiar sound--something like the humming of a\ndistant gong. It seemed to come across to us in the darkness from the waste\nof swamps and willows opposite. It was repeated at regular intervals, but\nit was certainly neither the sound of a bell nor the hooting of a distant\nsteamer. I can liken it to nothing so much as to the sound of an immense\ngong, suspended far up in the sky, repeating incessantly its muffled\nmetallic note, soft and musical, as it was repeatedly struck. My heart\nquickened as I listened.\n\n\"I've heard it all day,\" said my companion. \"While you slept this afternoon\nit came all round the island. I hunted it down, but could never get near\nenough to see--to localize it correctly. Sometimes it was overhead, and\nsometimes it seemed under the water. Once or twice, too, I could have sworn\nit was not outside at all, but within myself--you know--the way a sound in\nthe fourth dimension is supposed to come.\"\n\nI was too much puzzled to pay much attention to his words. I listened\ncarefully, striving to associate it with any known familiar sound I could\nthink of, but without success. It changed in the direction, too, coming\nnearer, and then sinking utterly away into remote distance. I cannot say\nthat it was ominous in quality, because to me it seemed distinctly musical,\nyet I must admit it set going a distressing feeling that made me wish I had\nnever heard it.\n\n\"The wind blowing in those sand-funnels,\" I said determined to find an\nexplanation, \"or the bushes rubbing together after the storm perhaps.\"\n\n\"It comes off the whole swamp,\" my friend answered. \"It comes from\neverywhere at once.\" He ignored my explanations. \"It comes from the willow\nbushes somehow--\"\n\n\"But now the wind has dropped,\" I objected. \"The willows can hardly make a\nnoise by themselves, can they?\"\n\nHis answer frightened me, first because I had dreaded it, and secondly,\nbecause I knew intuitively it was true.\n\n\"It is because the wind has dropped we now hear it. It was drowned before.\nIt is the cry, I believe, of the--\"\n\nI dashed back to my fire, warned by the sound of bubbling that the stew was\nin danger, but determined at the same time to escape further conversation.\nI was resolute, if possible, to avoid the exchanging of views. I dreaded,\ntoo, that he would begin about the gods, or the elemental forces, or\nsomething else disquieting, and I wanted to keep myself well in hand for\nwhat might happen later. There was another night to be faced before we\nescaped from this distressing place, and there was no knowing yet what it\nmight bring forth.\n\n\"Come and cut up bread for the pot,\" I called to him, vigorously stirring\nthe appetizing mixture. That stew-pot held sanity for us both, and the\nthought made me laugh.\n\nHe came over slowly and took the provision sack from the tree, fumbling in\nits mysterious depths, and then emptying the entire contents upon the\nground-sheet at his feet.\n\n\"Hurry up!\" I cried; \"it's boiling.\"\n\nThe Swede burst out into a roar of laughter that startled me. It was forced\nlaughter, not artificial exactly, but mirthless.\n\n\"There's nothing here!\" he shouted, holding his sides.\n\n\"Bread, I mean.\"\n\n\"It's gone. There is no bread. They've taken it!\"\n\nI dropped the long spoon and ran up. Everything the sack had contained lay\nupon the ground-sheet, but there was no loaf.\n\nThe whole dead weight of my growing fear fell upon me and shook me. Then I\nburst out laughing too. It was the only thing to do: and the sound of my\nlaughter also made me understand his. The stain of psychical pressure\ncaused it--this explosion of unnatural laughter in both of us; it was an\neffort of repressed forces to seek relief; it was a temporary safety-valve.\nAnd with both of us it ceased quite suddenly.\n\n\"How criminally stupid of me!\" I cried, still determined to be consistent\nand find an explanation. \"I clean forgot to buy a loaf at Pressburg. That\nchattering woman put everything out of my head, and I must have left it\nlying on the counter or--\"\n\n\"The oatmeal, too, is much less than it was this morning,\" the Swede\ninterrupted.\n\nWhy in the world need he draw attention to it? I thought angrily.\n\n\"There's enough for tomorrow,\" I said, stirring vigorously, \"and we can get\nlots more at Komorn or Gran. In twenty-four hours we shall be miles from\nhere.\"\n\n\"I hope so--to God,\" he muttered, putting the things back into the sack,\n\"unless we're claimed first as victims for the sacrifice,\" he added with a\nfoolish laugh. He dragged the sack into the tent, for safety's sake, I\nsuppose, and I heard him mumbling to himself, but so indistinctly that it\nseemed quite natural for me to ignore his words.\n\nOur meal was beyond question a gloomy one, and we ate it almost in silence,\navoiding one another's eyes, and keeping the fire bright. Then we washed up\nand prepared for the night, and, once smoking, our minds unoccupied with\nany definite duties, the apprehension I had felt all day long became more\nand more acute. It was not then active fear, I think, but the very\nvagueness of its origin distressed me far more that if I had been able to\nticket and face it squarely. The curious sound I have likened to the note\nof a gong became now almost incessant, and filled the stillness of the\nnight with a faint, continuous ringing rather than a series of distinct\nnotes. At one time it was behind and at another time in front of us.\nSometimes I fancied it came from the bushes on our left, and then again\nfrom the clumps on our right. More often it hovered directly overhead like\nthe whirring of wings. It was really everywhere at once, behind, in front,\nat our sides and over our heads, completely surrounding us. The sound\nreally defies description. But nothing within my knowledge is like that\nceaseless muffled humming rising off the deserted world of swamps and\nwillows.\n\nWe sat smoking in comparative silence, the strain growing every minute\ngreater. The worst feature of the situation seemed to me that we did not\nknow what to expect, and could therefore make no sort of preparation by way\nof defense. We could anticipate nothing. My explanations made in the\nsunshine, moreover, now came to haunt me with their foolish and wholly\nunsatisfactory nature, and it was more and more clear to us that some kind\nof plain talk with my companion was inevitable, whether I liked it or not.\nAfter all, we had to spend the night together, and to sleep in the same\ntent side by side. I saw that I could not get along much longer without the\nsupport of his mind, and for that, of course, plain talk was imperative. As\nlong as possible, however, I postponed this little climax, and tried to\nignore or laugh at the occasional sentences he flung into the emptiness.\n\nSome of these sentences, moreover, were confoundedly disquieting to me,\ncoming as they did to corroborate much that I felt myself; corroboration,\ntoo--which made it so much more convincing--from a totally different point\nof view. He composed such curious sentences, and hurled them at me in such\nan inconsequential sort of way, as though his main line of thought was\nsecret to himself, and these fragments were mere bits he found it\nimpossible to digest. He got rid of them by uttering them. Speech relieved\nhim. It was like being sick.\n\n\"There are things about us, I'm sure, that make for disorder,\ndisintegration, destruction, our destruction,\" he said once, while the fire\nblazed between us. \"We've strayed out of a safe line somewhere.\"\n\nAnd, another time, when the gong sounds had come nearer, ringing much\nlouder than before, and directly over our heads, he said as though talking\nto himself:\n\n\"I don't think a gramophone would show any record of that. The sound\ndoesn't come to me by the ears at all. The vibrations reach me in another\nmanner altogether, and seem to be within me, which is precisely how a\nfourth dimensional sound might be supposed to make itself heard.\"\n\nI purposely made no reply to this, but I sat up a little closer to the fire\nand peered about me into the darkness. The clouds were massed all over the\nsky, and no trace of moonlight came through. Very still, too, everything\nwas, so that the river and the frogs had things all their own way.\n\n\"It has that about it,\" he went on, \"which is utterly out of common\nexperience. It is unknown. Only one thing describes it really; it is a\nnon-human sound; I mean a sound outside humanity.\"\n\nHaving rid himself of this indigestible morsel, he lay quiet for a time,\nbut he had so admirably expressed my own feeling that it was a relief to\nhave the thought out, and to have confined it by the limitation of words\nfrom dangerous wandering to and fro in the mind.\n\nThe solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget it? The\nfeeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My thoughts ran\nincessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I would have given my soul,\nas the saying is, for the \"feel\" of those Bavarian villages we had passed\nthrough by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces; peasants drinking\nbeer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a ruined castle on the\nrocks behind the red-roofed church. Even the tourists would have been\nwelcome.\n\nYet what I felt of dread was no ordinary ghostly fear. It was infinitely\ngreater, stranger, and seemed to arise from some dim ancestral sense of\nterror more profoundly disturbing than anything I had known or dreamed of.\nWe had \"strayed,\" as the Swede put it, into some region or some set of\nconditions where the risks were great, yet unintelligible to us; where the\nfrontiers of some unknown world lay close about us. It was a spot held by\nthe dwellers in some outer space, a sort of peep-hole whence they could spy\nupon the earth, themselves unseen, a point where the veil between had worn\na little thin. As the final result of too long a sojourn here, we should be\ncarried over the border and deprived of what we called \"our lives,\" yet by\nmental, not physical, processes. In that sense, as he said, we should be\nthe victims of our adventure--a sacrifice.\n\nIt took us in different fashion, each according to the measure of his\nsensitiveness and powers of resistance. I translated it vaguely into a\npersonification of the mightily disturbed elements, investing them with the\nhorror of a deliberate and malefic purpose, resentful of our audacious\nintrusion into their breeding-place; whereas my friend threw it into the\nunoriginal form at first of a trespass on some ancient shrine, some place\nwhere the old gods still held sway, where the emotional forces of former\nworshippers still clung, and the ancestral portion of him yielded to the\nold pagan spell.\n\nAt any rate, here was a place unpolluted by men, kept clean by the winds\nfrom coarsening human influences, a place where spiritual agencies were\nwithin reach and aggressive. Never, before or since, have I been so\nattacked by indescribable suggestions of a \"beyond region,\" of another\nscheme of life, another revolution not parallel to the human. And in the\nend our minds would succumb under the weight of the awful spell, and we\nshould be drawn across the frontier into their world.\n\nSmall things testified to the amazing influence of the place, and now in\nthe silence round the fire they allowed themselves to be noted by the mind.\nThe very atmosphere had proved itself a magnifying medium to distort every\nindication: the otter rolling in the current, the hurrying boatman making\nsigns, the shifting willows, one and all had been robbed of its natural\ncharacter, and revealed in something of its other aspect--as it existed\nacross the border to that other region. And this changed aspect I felt was\nnow not merely to me, but to the race. The whole experience whose verge we\ntouched was unknown to humanity at all. It was a new order of experience,\nand in the true sense of the word unearthly.\n\n\"It's the deliberate, calculating purpose that reduces one's courage to\nzero,\" the Swede said suddenly, as if he had been actually following my\nthoughts. \"Otherwise imagination might count for much. But the paddle, the\ncanoe, the lessening food--\"\n\n\"Haven't I explained all that once?\" I interrupted viciously.\n\n\"You have,\" he answered dryly; \"you have indeed.\"\n\nHe made other remarks too, as usual, about what he called the \"plain\ndetermination to provide a victim\"; but, having now arranged my thoughts\nbetter, I recognized that this was simply the cry of his frightened soul\nagainst the knowledge that he was being attacked in a vital part, and that\nhe would be somehow taken or destroyed. The situation called for a courage\nand calmness of reasoning that neither of us could compass, and I have\nnever before been so clearly conscious of two persons in me--the one that\nexplained everything, and the other that laughed at such foolish\nexplanations, yet was horribly afraid.\n\nMeanwhile, in the pitchy night the fire died down and the wood pile grew\nsmall. Neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the darkness\nconsequently came up very close to our faces. A few feet beyond the circle\nof firelight it was inky black. Occasionally a stray puff of wind set the\nwillows shivering about us, but apart from this not very welcome sound a\ndeep and depressing silence reigned, broken only by the gurgling of the\nriver and the humming in the air overhead.\n\nWe both missed, I think, the shouting company of the winds.\n\nAt length, at a moment when a stray puff prolonged itself as though the\nwind were about to rise again, I reached the point for me of saturation,\nthe point where it was absolutely necessary to find relief in plain speech,\nor else to betray myself by some hysterical extravagance that must have\nbeen far worse in its effect upon both of us. I kicked the fire into a\nblaze, and turned to my companion abruptly. He looked up with a start.\n\n\"I can't disguise it any longer,\" I said; \"I don't like this place, and the\ndarkness, and the noises, and the awful feelings I get. There's something\nhere that beats me utterly. I'm in a blue funk, and that's the plain truth.\nIf the other shore was--different, I swear I'd be inclined to swim for it!\"\n\nThe Swede's face turned very white beneath the deep tan of sun and wind. He\nstared straight at me and answered quietly, but his voice betrayed his huge\nexcitement by its unnatural calmness. For the moment, at any rate, he was\nthe strong man of the two. He was more phlegmatic, for one thing.\n\n\"It's not a physical condition we can escape from by running away,\" he\nreplied, in the tone of a doctor diagnosing some grave disease; \"we must\nsit tight and wait. There are forces close here that could kill a herd of\nelephants in a second as easily as you or I could squash a fly. Our only\nchance is to keep perfectly still. Our insignificance perhaps may save us.\"\n\nI put a dozen questions into my expression of face, but found no words. It\nwas precisely like listening to an accurate description of a disease whose\nsymptoms had puzzled me.\n\n\"I mean that so far, although aware of our disturbing presence, they have\nnot found us--not 'located' us, as the Americans say,\" he went on. \"They're\nblundering about like men hunting for a leak of gas. The paddle and canoe\nand provisions prove that. I think they feel us, but cannot actually see\nus. We must keep our minds quiet--it's our minds they feel. We must control\nour thoughts, or it's all up with us.\"\n\n\"Death, you mean?\" I stammered, icy with the horror of his suggestion.\n\n\"Worse--by far,\" he said. \"Death, according to one's belief, means either\nannihilation or release from the limitations of the senses, but it involves\nno change of character. You don't suddenly alter just because the body's\ngone. But this means a radical alteration, a complete change, a horrible\nloss of oneself by substitution--far worse than death, and not even\nannihilation. We happen to have camped in a spot where their region touches\nours, where the veil between has worn thin\"--horrors! he was using my very\nown phrase, my actual words--\"so that they are aware of our being in their\nneighborhood.\"\n\n\"But who are aware?\" I asked.\n\nI forgot the shaking of the willows in the windless calm, the humming\noverhead, everything except that I was waiting for an answer that I dreaded\nmore than I can possibly explain.\n\nHe lowered his voice at once to reply, leaning forward a little over the\nfire, an indefinable change in his face that made me avoid his eyes and\nlook down upon the ground.\n\n\"All my life,\" he said, \"I have been strangely, vividly conscious of\nanother region--not far removed from our own world in one sense, yet wholly\ndifferent in kind--where great things go on unceasingly, where immense and\nterrible personalities hurry by, intent on vast purposes compared to which\nearthly affairs, the rise and fall of nations, the destinies of empires,\nthe fate of armies and continents, are all as dust in the balance; vast\npurposes, I mean, that deal directly with the soul, and not indirectly with\nmore expressions of the soul--\"\n\n\"I suggest just now--\" I began, seeking to stop him, feeling as though I\nwas face to face with a madman. But he instantly overbore me with his\ntorrent that had to come.\n\n\"You think,\" he said, \"it is the spirit of the elements, and I thought\nperhaps it was the old gods. But I tell you now it is--neither. These would\nbe comprehensible entities, for they have relations with men, depending\nupon them for worship or sacrifice, whereas these beings who are now about\nus have absolutely nothing to do with mankind, and it is mere chance that\ntheir space happens just at this spot to touch our own.\"\n\nThe mere conception, which his words somehow made so convincing, as I\nlistened to them there in the dark stillness of that lonely island, set me\nshaking a little all over. I found it impossible to control my movements.\n\n\"And what do you propose?\" I began again.\n\n\"A sacrifice, a victim, might save us by distracting them until we could\nget away,\" he went on, \"just as the wolves stop to devour the dogs and give\nthe sleigh another start. But--I see no chance of any other victim now.\"\n\nI stared blankly at him. The gleam in his eye was dreadful. Presently he\ncontinued.\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\n\"It's the willows, of course. The willows mask the others, but the others\nare feeling about for us. If we let our minds betray our fear, we're lost,\nlost utterly.\" He looked at me with an expression so calm, so determined,\nso sincere, that I no longer had any doubts as to his sanity. He was as\nsane as any man ever was. \"If we can hold out through the night,\" he added,\n\"we may get off in the daylight unnoticed, or rather, undiscovered.\"\n\n\"But you really think a sacrifice would--\"\n\nThat gong-like humming came down very close over our heads as I spoke, but\nit was my friend's scared face that really stopped my mouth.\n\n\"Hush!\" he whispered, holding up his hand. \"Do not mention them more than\nyou can help. Do not refer to them by name. To name is to reveal; it is the\ninevitable clue, and our only hope lies in ignoring them, in order that\nthey may ignore us.\"\n\n\"Even in thought?\" He was extraordinarily agitated.\n\n\"Especially in thought. Our thoughts make spirals in their world. We must\nkeep them out of our minds at all costs if possible.\"\n\nI raked the fire together to prevent the darkness having everything its own\nway. I never longed for the sun as I longed for it then in the awful\nblackness of that summer night.\n\n\"Were you awake all last night?\" he went on suddenly.\n\n\"I slept badly a little after dawn,\" I replied evasively, trying to follow\nhis instructions, which I knew instinctively were true, \"but the wind, of\ncourse--\"\n\n\"I know. But the wind won't account for all the noises.\"\n\n\"Then you heard it too?\"\n\n\"The multiplying countless little footsteps I heard,\" he said, adding,\nafter a moment's hesitation, \"and that other sound--\"\n\n\"You mean above the tent, and the pressing down upon us of something\ntremendous, gigantic?\"\n\nHe nodded significantly.\n\n\"It was like the beginning of a sort of inner suffocation?\" I said.\n\n\"Partly, yes. It seemed to me that the weight of the atmosphere had been\naltered--had increased enormously, so that we should have been crushed.\"\n\n\"And that,\" I went on, determined to have it all out, pointing upwards\nwhere the gong-like note hummed ceaselessly, rising and falling like wind.\n\"What do you make of that?\"\n\n\"It's their sound,\" he whispered gravely. \"It's the sound of their world,\nthe humming in their region. The division here is so thin that it leaks\nthrough somehow. But, if you listen carefully, you'll find it's not above\nso much as around us. It's in the willows. It's the willows themselves\nhumming, because here the willows have been made symbols of the forces that\nare against us.\"\n\nI could not follow exactly what he meant by this, yet the thought and idea\nin my mind were beyond question the thought and idea in his. I realized\nwhat he realized, only with less power of analysis than his. It was on the\ntip of my tongue to tell him at last about my hallucination of the\nascending figures and the moving bushes, when he suddenly thrust his face\nagain close into mine across the firelight and began to speak in a very\nearnest whisper. He amazed me by his calmness and pluck, his apparent\ncontrol of the situation. This man I had for years deemed unimaginative,\nstolid!\n\n\"Now listen,\" he said. \"The only thing for us to do is to go on as though\nnothing had happened, follow our usual habits, go to bed, and so forth;\npretend we feel nothing and notice nothing. It is a question wholly of the\nmind, and the less we think about them the better our chance of escape.\nAbove all, don't think, for what you think happens!\"\n\n\"All right,\" I managed to reply, simply breathless with his words and the\nstrangeness of it all; \"all right, I'll try, but tell me one more thing\nfirst. Tell me what you make of those hollows in the ground all about us,\nthose sand-funnels?\"\n\n\"No!\" he cried, forgetting to whisper in his excitement. \"I dare not,\nsimply dare not, put the thought into words. If you have not guessed I am\nglad. Don't try to. They have put it into my mind; try your hardest to\nprevent their putting it into yours.\"\n\nHe sank his voice again to a whisper before he finished, and I did not\npress him to explain. There was already just about as much horror in me as\nI could hold. The conversation came to an end, and we smoked our pipes\nbusily in silence.\n\nThen something happened, something unimportant apparently, as the way is\nwhen the nerves are in a very great state of tension, and this small thing\nfor a brief space gave me an entirely different point of view. I chanced to\nlook down at my sand-shoe--the sort we used for the canoe--and something to\ndo with the hole at the toe suddenly recalled to me the London shop where I\nhad bought them, the difficulty the man had in fitting me, and other\ndetails of the uninteresting but practical operation. At once, in its\ntrain, followed a wholesome view of the modern skeptical world I was\naccustomed to move in at home. I thought of roast beef, and ale,\nmotor-cars, policemen, brass bands, and a dozen other things that\nproclaimed the soul of ordinariness or utility. The effect was immediate\nand astonishing even to myself. Psychologically, I suppose, it was simply a\nsudden and violent reaction after the strain of living in an atmosphere of\nthings that to the normal consciousness must seem impossible and\nincredible. But, whatever the cause, it momentarily lifted the spell from\nmy heart, and left me for the short space of a minute feeling free and\nutterly unafraid. I looked up at my friend opposite.\n\n\"You damned old pagan!\" I cried, laughing aloud in his face. \"You\nimaginative idiot! You superstitious idolater! You--\"\n\nI stopped in the middle, seized anew by the old horror. I tried to smother\nthe sound of my voice as something sacrilegious. The Swede, of course,\nheard it too--the strange cry overhead in the darkness--and that sudden\ndrop in the air as though something had come nearer.\n\nHe had turned ashen white under the tan. He stood bolt upright in front of\nthe fire, stiff as a rod, staring at me.\n\n\"After that,\" he said in a sort of helpless, frantic way, \"we must go! We\ncan't stay now; we must strike camp this very instant and go on--down the\nriver.\"\n\nHe was talking, I saw, quite wildly, his words dictated by abject\nterror--the terror he had resisted so long, but which had caught him at\nlast.\n\n\"In the dark?\" I exclaimed, shaking with fear after my hysterical outburst,\nbut still realizing our position better than he did. \"Sheer madness! The\nriver's in flood, and we've only got a single paddle. Besides, we only go\ndeeper into their country! There's nothing ahead for fifty miles but\nwillows, willows, willows!\"\n\nHe sat down again in a state of semi-collapse. The positions, by one of\nthose kaleidoscopic changes nature loves, were suddenly reversed, and the\ncontrol of our forces passed over into my hands. His mind at last had\nreached the point where it was beginning to weaken.\n\n\"What on earth possessed you to do such a thing?\" he whispered with the awe\nof genuine terror in his voice and face.\n\nI crossed round to his side of the fire. I took both his hands in mine,\nkneeling down beside him and looking straight into his frightened eyes.\n\n\"We'll make one more blaze,\" I said firmly, \"and then turn in for the\nnight. At sunrise we'll be off full speed for Komorn. Now, pull yourself\ntogether a bit, and remember your own advice about not thinking fear!\"\n\nHe said no more, and I saw that he would agree and obey. In some measure,\ntoo, it was a sort of relief to get up and make an excursion into the\ndarkness for more wood. We kept close together, almost touching, groping\namong the bushes and along the bank. The humming overhead never ceased, but\nseemed to me to grow louder as we increased our distance from the fire. It\nwas shivery work!\n\nWe were grubbing away in the middle of a thickish clump of willows where\nsome driftwood from a former flood had caught high among the branches, when\nmy body was seized in a grip that made me half drop upon the sand. It was\nthe Swede. He had fallen against me, and was clutching me for support. I\nheard his breath coming and going in short gasps.\n\n\"Look! By my soul!\" he whispered, and for the first time in my experience I\nknew what it was to hear tears of terror in a human voice. He was pointing\nto the fire, some fifty feet away. I followed the direction of his finger,\nand I swear my heart missed a beat.\n\nThere, in front of the dim glow, something was moving.\n\nI saw it through a veil that hung before my eyes like the gauze\ndrop-curtain used at the back of a theater--hazily a little. It was neither\na human figure nor an animal. To me it gave the strange impression of being\nas large as several animals grouped together, like horses, two or three,\nmoving slowly. The Swede, too, got a similar result, though expressing it\ndifferently, for he thought it was shaped and sized like a clump of willow\nbushes, rounded at the top, and moving all over upon its surface--\"coiling\nupon itself like smoke,\" he said afterwards.\n\n\"I watched it settle downwards through the bushes,\" he sobbed at me. \"Look,\nby God! It's coming this way! Oh, oh!\"--he gave a kind of whistling cry.\n\"They've found us.\"\n\nI gave one terrified glance, which just enabled me to see that the shadowy\nform was swinging towards us through the bushes, and then I collapsed\nbackwards with a crash into the branches. These failed, of course, to\nsupport my weight, so that with the Swede on top of me we fell in a\nstruggling heap upon the sand. I really hardly knew what was happening. I\nwas conscious only of a sort of enveloping sensation of icy fear that\nplucked the nerves out of their fleshly covering, twisted them this way and\nthat, and replaced them quivering. My eyes were tightly shut; something in\nmy throat choked me; a feeling that my consciousness was expanding,\nextending out into space, swiftly gave way to another feeling that I was\nlosing it altogether, and about to die.\n\nAn acute spasm of pain passed through me, and I was aware that the Swede\nhad hold of me in such a way that he hurt me abominably. It was the way he\ncaught at me in falling.\n\nBut it was the pain, he declared afterwards, that saved me; it caused me to\nforget them and think of something else at the very instant when they were\nabout to find me. It concealed my mind from them at the moment of\ndiscovery, yet just in time to evade their terrible seizing of me. He\nhimself, he says, actually swooned at the same moment, and that was what\nsaved him.\n\nI only know that at a later date, how long or short is impossible to say, I\nfound myself scrambling up out of the slippery network of willow branches,\nand saw my companion standing in front of me holding out a hand to assist\nme. I stared at him in a dazed way, rubbing the arm he had twisted for me.\nNothing came to me to say, somehow.\n\n\"I lost consciousness for a moment or two,\" I heard him say. \"That's what\nsaved me. It made me stop thinking about them.\"\n\n\"You nearly broke my arm in two,\" I said, uttering my only connected\nthought at the moment. A numbness came over me.\n\n\"That's what saved you!\" he replied. \"Between us, we've managed to set them\noff on a false tack somewhere. The humming has ceased. It's gone--for the\nmoment at any rate!\"\n\nA wave of hysterical laughter seized me again, and this time spread to my\nfriend too--great healing gusts of shaking laughter that brought a\ntremendous sense of relief in their train. We made our way back to the fire\nand put the wood on so that it blazed at once. Then we saw that the tent\nhad fallen over and lay in a tangled heap upon the ground.\n\nWe picked it up, and during the process tripped more than once and caught\nour feet in sand.\n\n\"It's those sand-funnels,\" exclaimed the Swede, when the tent was up again\nand the firelight lit up the ground for several yards about us. \"And look\nat the size of them!\"\n\nAll round the tent and about the fireplace where we had seen the moving\nshadows there were deep funnel-shaped hollows in the sand, exactly similar\nto the ones we had already found over the island, only far bigger and\ndeeper, beautifully formed, and wide enough in some instances to admit the\nwhole of my foot and leg.\n\nNeither of us said a word. We both knew that sleep was the safest thing we\ncould do, and to bed we went accordingly without further delay, having\nfirst thrown sand on the fire and taken the provision sack and the paddle\ninside the tent with us. The canoe, too, we propped in such a way at the\nend of the tent that our feet touched it, and the least motion would\ndisturb and wake us.\n\nIn case of emergency, too, we again went to bed in our clothes, ready for a\nsudden start.\n\nIt was my firm intention to lie awake all night and watch, but the\nexhaustion of nerves and body decreed otherwise, and sleep after a while\ncame over me with a welcome blanket of oblivion. The fact that my companion\nalso slept quickened its approach. At first he fidgeted and constantly sat\nup, asking me if I \"heard this\" or \"heard that.\" He tossed about on his\ncork mattress, and said the tent was moving and the river had risen over\nthe point of the island, but each time I went out to look I returned with\nthe report that all was well, and finally he grew calmer and lay still.\nThen at length his breathing became regular and I heard unmistakable sounds\nof snoring--the first and only time in my life when snoring has been a\nwelcome and calming influence.\n\nThis, I remember, was the last thought in my mind before dozing off.\n\nA difficulty in breathing woke me, and I found the blanket over my face.\nBut something else besides the blanket was pressing upon me, and my first\nthought was that my companion had rolled off his mattress on to my own in\nhis sleep. I called to him and sat up, and at the same moment it came to me\nthat the tent was surrounded. That sound of multitudinous soft pattering\nwas again audible outside, filling the night with horror.\n\nI called again to him, louder than before. He did not answer, but I missed\nthe sound of his snoring, and also noticed that the flap of the tent was\ndown. This was the unpardonable sin. I crawled out in the darkness to hook\nit back securely, and it was then for the first time I realized positively\nthat the Swede was not here. He had gone.\n\nI dashed out in a mad run, seized by a dreadful agitation, and the moment I\nwas out I plunged into a sort of torrent of humming that surrounded me\ncompletely and came out of every quarter of the heavens at once. It was\nthat same familiar humming--gone mad! A swarm of great invisible bees might\nhave been about me in the air. The sound seemed to thicken the very\natmosphere, and I felt that my lungs worked with difficulty.\n\nBut my friend was in danger, and I could not hesitate.\n\nThe dawn was just about to break, and a faint whitish light spread upwards\nover the clouds from a thin strip of clear horizon. No wind stirred. I\ncould just make out the bushes and river beyond, and the pale sandy\npatches. In my excitement I ran frantically to and fro about the island,\ncalling him by name, shouting at the top of my voice the first words that\ncame into my head. But the willows smothered my voice, and the humming\nmuffled it, so that the sound only traveled a few feet round me. I plunged\namong the bushes, tripping headlong, tumbling over roots, and scraping my\nface as I tore this way and that among the preventing branches.\n\nThen, quite unexpectedly, I came out upon the island's point and saw a dark\nfigure outlined between the water and the sky. It was the Swede. And\nalready he had one foot in the river! A moment more and he would have taken\nthe plunge.\n\nI threw myself upon him, flinging my arms about his waist and dragging him\nshorewards with all my strength. Of course he struggled furiously, making a\nnoise all the time just like that cursed humming, and using the most\noutlandish phrases in his anger about \"going inside to Them,\" and \"taking\nthe way of the water and the wind,\" and God only knows what more besides,\nthat I tried in vain to recall afterwards, but which turned me sick with\nhorror and amazement as I listened. But in the end I managed to get him\ninto the comparative safety of the tent, and flung him breathless and\ncursing upon the mattress where I held him until the fit had passed.\n\nI think the suddenness with which it all went and he grew calm, coinciding\nas it did with the equally abrupt cessation of the humming and pattering\noutside--I think this was almost the strangest part of the whole business\nperhaps. For he had just opened his eyes and turned his tired face up to me\nso that the dawn threw a pale light upon it through the doorway, and said,\nfor all the world just like a frightened child:\n\n\"My life, old man--it's my life I owe you. But it's all over now anyhow.\nThey've found a victim in our place!\"\n\nThen he dropped back upon his blankets and went to sleep literally under my\neyes. He simply collapsed, and began to snore again as healthily as though\nnothing had happened and he had never tried to offer his own life as a\nsacrifice by drowning. And when the sunlight woke him three hours\nlater--hours of ceaseless vigil for me--it became so clear to me that he\nremembered absolutely nothing of what he had attempted to do, that I deemed\nit wise to hold my peace and ask no dangerous questions.\n\nHe woke naturally and easily, as I have said, when the sun was already high\nin a windless hot sky, and he at once got up and set about the preparation\nof the fire for breakfast. I followed him anxiously at bathing, but he did\nnot attempt to plunge in, merely dipping his head and making some remark\nabout the extra coldness of the water.\n\n\"River's falling at last,\" he said, \"and I'm glad of it.\"\n\n\"The humming has stopped too,\" I said.\n\nHe looked up at me quietly with his normal expression. Evidently he\nremembered everything except his own attempt at suicide.\n\n\"Everything has stopped,\" he said, \"because--\"\n\nHe hesitated. But I knew some reference to that remark he had made just\nbefore he fainted was in his mind, and I was determined to know it.\n\n\"Because 'They've found another victim'?\" I said, forcing a little laugh.\n\n\"Exactly,\" he answered, \"exactly! I feel as positive of it as though--as\nthough--I feel quite safe again, I mean,\" he finished.\n\nHe began to look curiously about him. The sunlight lay in hot patches on\nthe sand. There was no wind. The willows were motionless. He slowly rose to\nfeet.\n\n\"Come,\" he said; \"I think if we look, we shall find it.\"\n\nHe started off on a run, and I followed him. He kept to the banks, poking\nwith a stick among the sandy bays and caves and little back-waters, myself\nalways close on his heels.\n\n\"Ah!\" he exclaimed presently, \"ah!\"\n\nThe tone of his voice somehow brought back to me a vivid sense of the\nhorror of the last twenty-four hours, and I hurried up to join him. He was\npointing with his stick at a large black object that lay half in the water\nand half on the sand. It appeared to be caught by some twisted willow roots\nso that the river could not sweep it away. A few hours before the spot must\nhave been under water.\n\n\"See,\" he said quietly, \"the victim that made our escape possible!\"\n\nAnd when I peered across his shoulder I saw that his stick rested on the\nbody of a man. He turned it over. It was the corpse of a peasant, and the\nface was hidden in the sand. Clearly the man had been drowned, but a few\nhours before, and his body must have been swept down upon our island\nsomewhere about the hour of the dawn--at the very time the fit had passed.\n\n\"We must give it a decent burial, you know.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" I replied. I shuddered a little in spite of myself, for\nthere was something about the appearance of that poor drowned man that\nturned me cold.\n\nThe Swede glanced up sharply at me, an undecipherable expression on his\nface, and began clambering down the bank. I followed him more leisurely.\nThe current, I noticed, had torn away much of the clothing from the body,\nso that the neck and part of the chest lay bare.\n\nHalfway down the bank my companion suddenly stopped and held up his hand in\nwarning; but either my foot slipped, or I had gained too much momentum to\nbring myself quickly to a halt, for I bumped into him and sent him forward\nwith a sort of leap to save himself. We tumbled together on to the hard\nsand so that our feet splashed into the water. And, before anything could\nbe done, we had collided a little heavily against the corpse.\n\nThe Swede uttered a sharp cry. And I sprang back as if I had been shot.\n\nAt the moment we touched the body there rose from its surface the loud\nsound of humming--the sound of several hummings--which passed with a vast\ncommotion as of winged things in the air about us and disappeared upwards\ninto the sky, growing fainter and fainter till they finally ceased in the\ndistance. It was exactly as though we had disturbed some living yet\ninvisible creatures at work.\n\nMy companion clutched me, and I think I clutched him, but before either of\nus had time properly to recover from the unexpected shock, we saw that a\nmovement of the current was turning the corpse round so that it became\nreleased from the grip of the willow roots. A moment later it had turned\ncompletely over, the dead face uppermost, staring at the sky. It lay on the\nedge of the main stream. In another moment it would be swept away.\n\nThe Swede started to save it, shouting again something I did not catch\nabout a \"proper burial\"--and then abruptly dropped upon his knees on the\nsand and covered his eyes with his hands. I was beside him in an instant.\n\nI saw what he had seen.\n\nFor just as the body swung round to the current the face and the exposed\nchest turned full towards us, and showed plainly how the skin and flesh\nwere indented with small hollows, beautifully formed, and exactly similar\nin shape and kind to the sand-funnels that we had found all over the\nisland.\n\n\"Their mark!\" I heard my companion mutter under his breath. \"Their awful\nmark!\"\n\nAnd when I turned my eyes again from his ghastly face to the river, the\ncurrent had done its work, and the body had been swept away into mid-stream\nand was already beyond our reach and almost out of sight, turning over and\nover on the waves like an otter.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Willows, by Algernon Blackwood\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WILLOWS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11438.txt or 11438.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/1\/4\/3\/11438\/\n\nProduced by Suzanne Shell, David Newman and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\ndownload by the etext year.\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n    (Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n","id":1020,"split":"train"}
