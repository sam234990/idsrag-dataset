Eug\u00e9nie's father Felix is a former cooper who has become wealthy through both business ventures and inheritance (inheriting the estates of his mother-in-law, grandfather-in-law and grandmother all in one year). However, he is very miserly, and he, his wife, daughter and their servant Nanon live in a run-down old house which he is too miserly to repair. His banker des Grassins wishes Eug\u00e9nie to marry his son Adolphe, and his lawyer Cruchot wishes Eug\u00e9nie to marry his nephew President Cruchot des Bonfons, both parties eyeing the inheritance from Felix. The two families constantly visit the Grandets to get Felix's favour, and Felix in turn plays them off against each other for his own advantage.\nOn Eug\u00e9nie's birthday, in 1819, Felix's nephew Charles Grandet arrives from Paris unexpectedly at their home having been sent there by his father Guillaume. Charles does not realise that his father, having gone bankrupt, is planning to take his own life. Guillaume reveals this to his brother Felix in a confidential letter which Charles has carried.\nCharles is a spoilt and indolent young man, who is having an affair with an older woman. His father's ruin and suicide are soon published in the newspaper, and his uncle Felix reveals his problems to him. Felix considers Charles to be a burden, and plans to send him off overseas to make his own fortune. However, Eug\u00e9nie and Charles fall in love with each other, and hope to eventually marry. She gives him some of her own money to help with his trading ventures.\nMeanwhile, Felix hatches a plan to profit from his brother's ruin. He announces to Cruchot des Bonfons that he plans to liquidate his brother's business, and so avoid a declaration of bankruptcy, and therefore save the family honour. Cruchot des Bonfons volunteers to go to Paris to make the arrangements provided that Felix pays his expenses. The des Grassins then visit just as they are in the middle of discussions, and the banker des Grassins volunteers to do Felix's bidding for free. So Felix accepts des Grassins' offer instead of Cruchot des Bonfons'. The business is liquidated, and the creditors get 46% of their debts, in exchange for their bank bills. Felix then ignores all demands to pay the rest, whilst selling the bank bills at a profit.\nBy now Charles has left to travel overseas. He entrusts Eug\u00e9nie with a small gold plated cabinet which contains pictures of his parents.\nLater Felix is angered when he discovers that Eug\u00e9nie has given her money (all in gold coins) to Charles. This leads to his wife falling ill, and his daughter being confined to her room. Eventually they are reconciled, and Felix reluctantly agrees that Eug\u00e9nie can marry Charles.\nIn 1827 Charles returns to France. By now both of Eug\u00e9nie's parents have died. However Charles is no longer in love with Eug\u00e9nie. He has become very wealthy through his trading, but he has also become extremely corrupt. He becomes engaged to the daughter of an impoverished aristocratic family, in order to make himself respectable. He writes to Eug\u00e9nie to announce his marriage plans, and to break off their engagement. He also sends a cheque to pay off the money that she gave him. Eug\u00e9nie is heartbroken, especially when she discovers that Charles had been back in France for a month when he wrote to her. She sends back the cabinet.\nEug\u00e9nie then decides to become engaged to Cruchot des Bonfons on two conditions. One is that she remains a virgin after marriage, and the other is that he agrees to go to Paris to act for her to pay off all the debts due Guillaume Grandet's creditors. Cruchot des Bonfons carries out the debt payment in full. This comes just in time for Charles who finds that his future father-in-law objects to letting his daughter marry the son of a bankrupt. When Charles meets Cruchot des Bonfons, he discovers that Eug\u00e9nie is in fact far wealthier than he is. During his brief stay at Saumur, he had assumed from the state of their home that his relatives were poor.\nCruchot des Bonfons marries Eug\u00e9nie hopeful of becoming fabulously wealthy. However, he dies young, and at the end of the book Eug\u00e9nie is a very wealthy widow of thirty-three having now inherited her husband's fortune. At the end of the novel, although by the standards of the time she should be unhappy \u2013 childless and widowed \u2013 she is instead quite content with her lot. She has learned to live life on her own terms, and has also learned of the hypocrisy and shallowness of the bourgeois and that her best friends will come from the lower classes.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Eugenie Grandet, by Honore de Balzac\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Within these houses there is,\nperhaps, the silence of the cloister, the barrenness of moors, the\nskeleton of ruins; life and movement are so stagnant there that a\nstranger might think them uninhabited, were it not that he encounters\nsuddenly the pale, cold glance of a motionless person, whose\nhalf-monastic face peers beyond the window-casing at the sound of an\nunaccustomed step.\n\nSuch elements of sadness formed the physiognomy, as it were, of a\ndwelling-house in Saumur which stands at the end of the steep street\nleading to the chateau in the upper part of the town. This street--now\nlittle frequented, hot in summer, cold in winter, dark in certain\nsections--is remarkable for the resonance of its little pebbly pavement,\nalways clean and dry, for the narrowness of its tortuous road-way, for\nthe peaceful stillness of its houses, which belong to the Old town and\nare over-topped by the ramparts. Houses three centuries old are still\nsolid, though built of wood, and their divers aspects add to the\noriginality which commends this portion of Saumur to the attention of\nartists and antiquaries.\n\nIt is difficult to pass these houses without admiring the enormous oaken\nbeams, their ends carved into fantastic figures, which crown with a\nblack bas-relief the lower floor of most of them. In one place these\ntransverse timbers are covered with slate and mark a bluish line along\nthe frail wall of a dwelling covered by a roof _en colombage_ which\nbends beneath the weight of years, and whose rotting shingles are\ntwisted by the alternate action of sun and rain. In another place\nblackened, worn-out window-sills, with delicate sculptures now scarcely\ndiscernible, seem too weak to bear the brown clay pots from which\nsprings the heart's-ease or the rose-bush of some poor working-woman.\nFarther on are doors studded with enormous nails, where the genius of\nour forefathers has traced domestic hieroglyphics, of which the meaning\nis now lost forever. Here a Protestant attested his belief; there\na Leaguer cursed Henry IV.; elsewhere some bourgeois has carved the\ninsignia of his _noblesse de cloches_, symbols of his long-forgotten\nmagisterial glory. The whole history of France is there.\n\nNext to a tottering house with roughly plastered walls, where an artisan\nenshrines his tools, rises the mansion of a country gentleman, on the\nstone arch of which above the door vestiges of armorial bearings may\nstill be seen, battered by the many revolutions that have shaken France\nsince 1789. In this hilly street the ground-floors of the merchants are\nneither shops nor warehouses; lovers of the Middle Ages will here find\nthe _ouvrouere_ of our forefathers in all its naive simplicity. These\nlow rooms, which have no shop-frontage, no show-windows, in fact\nno glass at all, are deep and dark and without interior or exterior\ndecoration. Their doors open in two parts, each roughly iron-bound; the\nupper half is fastened back within the room, the lower half, fitted with\na spring-bell, swings continually to and fro. Air and light reach the\ndamp den within, either through the upper half of the door, or through\nan open space between the ceiling and a low front wall, breast-high,\nwhich is closed by solid shutters that are taken down every morning, put\nup every evening, and held in place by heavy iron bars.\n\nThis wall serves as a counter for the merchandise. No delusive display\nis there; only samples of the business, whatever it may chance to\nbe,--such, for instance, as three or four tubs full of codfish and\nsalt, a few bundles of sail-cloth, cordage, copper wire hanging from\nthe joists above, iron hoops for casks ranged along the wall, or a\nfew pieces of cloth upon the shelves. Enter. A neat girl, glowing\nwith youth, wearing a white kerchief, her arms red and bare, drops her\nknitting and calls her father or her mother, one of whom comes forward\nand sells you what you want, phlegmatically, civilly, or arrogantly,\naccording to his or her individual character, whether it be a matter of\ntwo sous' or twenty thousand francs' worth of merchandise. You may see a\ncooper, for instance, sitting in his doorway and twirling his thumbs as\nhe talks with a neighbor. To all appearance he owns nothing more than a\nfew miserable boat-ribs and two or three bundles of laths; but below\nin the port his teeming wood-yard supplies all the cooperage trade of\nAnjou. He knows to a plank how many casks are needed if the vintage is\ngood. A hot season makes him rich, a rainy season ruins him; in a single\nmorning puncheons worth eleven francs have been known to drop to six.\nIn this country, as in Touraine, atmospheric vicissitudes control\ncommercial life. Wine-growers, proprietors, wood-merchants, coopers,\ninn-keepers, mariners, all keep watch of the sun. They tremble when they\ngo to bed lest they should hear in the morning of a frost in the night;\nthey dread rain, wind, drought, and want water, heat, and clouds to\nsuit their fancy. A perpetual duel goes on between the heavens and their\nterrestrial interests. The barometer smooths, saddens, or makes merry\ntheir countenances, turn and turn about. From end to end of this street,\nformerly the Grand'Rue de Saumur, the words: \"Here's golden weather,\"\nare passed from door to door; or each man calls to his neighbor: \"It\nrains louis,\" knowing well what a sunbeam or the opportune rainfall is\nbringing him.\n\nOn Saturdays after midday, in the fine season, not one sou's worth\nof merchandise can be bought from these worthy traders. Each has\nhis vineyard, his enclosure of fields, and all spend two days in the\ncountry. This being foreseen, and purchases, sales, and profits provided\nfor, the merchants have ten or twelve hours to spend in parties of\npleasure, in making observations, in criticisms, and in continual\nspying. A housewife cannot buy a partridge without the neighbors asking\nthe husband if it were cooked to a turn. A young girl never puts her\nhead near a window that she is not seen by idling groups in the street.\nConsciences are held in the light; and the houses, dark, silent,\nimpenetrable as they seem, hide no mysteries. Life is almost wholly in\nthe open air; every household sits at its own threshold, breakfasts,\ndines, and quarrels there. No one can pass along the street without\nbeing examined; in fact formerly, when a stranger entered a provincial\ntown he was bantered and made game of from door to door. From this came\nmany good stories, and the nickname _copieux_, which was applied to the\ninhabitants of Angers, who excelled in such urban sarcasms.\n\nThe ancient mansions of the old town of Saumur are at the top of\nthis hilly street, and were formerly occupied by the nobility of the\nneighborhood. The melancholy dwelling where the events of the following\nhistory took place is one of these mansions,--venerable relics of a\ncentury in which men and things bore the characteristics of simplicity\nwhich French manners and customs are losing day by day. Follow the\nwindings of the picturesque thoroughfare, whose irregularities awaken\nrecollections that plunge the mind mechanically into reverie, and you\nwill see a somewhat dark recess, in the centre of which is hidden the\ndoor of the house of Monsieur Grandet. It is impossible to understand\nthe force of this provincial expression--the house of Monsieur\nGrandet--without giving the biography of Monsieur Grandet himself.\n\nMonsieur Grandet enjoyed a reputation in Saumur whose causes and effects\ncan never be fully understood by those who have not, at one time or\nanother, lived in the provinces. In 1789 Monsieur Grandet--still called\nby certain persons le Pere Grandet, though the number of such old\npersons has perceptibly diminished--was a master-cooper, able to read,\nwrite, and cipher. At the period when the French Republic offered for\nsale the church property in the arrondissement of Saumur, the cooper,\nthen forty years of age, had just married the daughter of a rich\nwood-merchant. Supplied with the ready money of his own fortune and his\nwife's _dot_, in all about two thousand louis-d'or, Grandet went to the\nnewly established \"district,\" where, with the help of two hundred double\nlouis given by his father-in-law to the surly republican who presided\nover the sales of the national domain, he obtained for a song, legally\nif not legitimately, one of the finest vineyards in the arrondissement,\nan old abbey, and several farms. The inhabitants of Saumur were so\nlittle revolutionary that they thought Pere Grandet a bold man, a\nrepublican, and a patriot with a mind open to all the new ideas; though\nin point of fact it was open only to vineyards. He was appointed a\nmember of the administration of Saumur, and his pacific influence made\nitself felt politically and commercially. Politically, he protected the\nci-devant nobles, and prevented, to the extent of his power, the sale of\nthe lands and property of the _emigres_; commercially, he furnished the\nRepublican armies with two or three thousand puncheons of white wine,\nand took his pay in splendid fields belonging to a community of women\nwhose lands had been reserved for the last lot.\n\nUnder the Consulate Grandet became mayor, governed wisely, and harvested\nstill better pickings. Under the Empire he was called Monsieur Grandet.\nNapoleon, however, did not like republicans, and superseded Monsieur\nGrandet (who was supposed to have worn the Phrygian cap) by a man of his\nown surroundings, a future baron of the Empire. Monsieur Grandet quitted\noffice without regret. He had constructed in the interests of the town\ncertain fine roads which led to his own property; his house and lands,\nvery advantageously assessed, paid moderate taxes; and since the\nregistration of his various estates, the vineyards, thanks to his\nconstant care, had become the \"head of the country,\"--a local term used\nto denote those that produced the finest quality of wine. He might have\nasked for the cross of the Legion of honor.\n\nThis event occurred in 1806. Monsieur Grandet was then fifty-seven years\nof age, his wife thirty-six, and an only daughter, the fruit of their\nlegitimate love, was ten years old. Monsieur Grandet, whom Providence\nno doubt desired to compensate for the loss of his municipal honors,\ninherited three fortunes in the course of this year,--that of Madame\nde la Gaudiniere, born de la Bertelliere, the mother of Madame Grandet;\nthat of old Monsieur de la Bertelliere, her grandfather; and, lastly,\nthat of Madame Gentillet, her grandmother on the mother's side: three\ninheritances, whose amount was not known to any one. The avarice of the\ndeceased persons was so keen that for a long time they had hoarded their\nmoney for the pleasure of secretly looking at it. Old Monsieur de la\nBertelliere called an investment an extravagance, and thought he got\nbetter interest from the sight of his gold than from the profits of\nusury. The inhabitants of Saumur consequently estimated his savings\naccording to \"the revenues of the sun's wealth,\" as they said.\n\nMonsieur Grandet thus obtained that modern title of nobility which\nour mania for equality can never rub out. He became the most imposing\npersonage in the arrondissement. He worked a hundred acres of vineyard,\nwhich in fruitful years yielded seven or eight hundred hogsheads of\nwine. He owned thirteen farms, an old abbey, whose windows and arches\nhe had walled up for the sake of economy,--a measure which preserved\nthem,--also a hundred and twenty-seven acres of meadow-land, where three\nthousand poplars, planted in 1793, grew and flourished; and finally, the\nhouse in which he lived. Such was his visible estate; as to his other\nproperty, only two persons could give even a vague guess at its value:\none was Monsieur Cruchot, a notary employed in the usurious investments\nof Monsieur Grandet; the other was Monsieur des Grassins, the richest\nbanker in Saumur, in whose profits Grandet had a certain covenanted and\nsecret share.\n\nAlthough old Cruchot and Monsieur des Grassins were both gifted with\nthe deep discretion which wealth and trust beget in the provinces, they\npublicly testified so much respect to Monsieur Grandet that observers\nestimated the amount of his property by the obsequious attention which\nthey bestowed upon him. In all Saumur there was no one not persuaded\nthat Monsieur Grandet had a private treasure, some hiding-place full\nof louis, where he nightly took ineffable delight in gazing upon great\nmasses of gold. Avaricious people gathered proof of this when they\nlooked at the eyes of the good man, to which the yellow metal seemed to\nhave conveyed its tints. The glance of a man accustomed to draw enormous\ninterest from his capital acquires, like that of the libertine, the\ngambler, or the sycophant, certain indefinable habits,--furtive,\neager, mysterious movements, which never escape the notice of\nhis co-religionists. This secret language is in a certain way the\nfreemasonry of the passions. Monsieur Grandet inspired the respectful\nesteem due to one who owed no man anything, who, skilful cooper and\nexperienced wine-grower that he was, guessed with the precision of an\nastronomer whether he ought to manufacture a thousand puncheons for his\nvintage, or only five hundred, who never failed in any speculation, and\nalways had casks for sale when casks were worth more than the commodity\nthat filled them, who could store his whole vintage in his cellars and\nbide his time to put the puncheons on the market at two hundred francs,\nwhen the little proprietors had been forced to sell theirs for five\nlouis. His famous vintage of 1811, judiciously stored and slowly\ndisposed of, brought him in more than two hundred and forty thousand\nfrancs.\n\nFinancially speaking, Monsieur Grandet was something between a tiger and\na boa-constrictor. He could crouch and lie low, watch his prey a long\nwhile, spring upon it, open his jaws, swallow a mass of louis, and\nthen rest tranquilly like a snake in process of digestion, impassible,\nmethodical, and cold. No one saw him pass without a feeling of\nadmiration mingled with respect and fear; had not every man in Saumur\nfelt the rending of those polished steel claws? For this one, Maitre\nCruchot had procured the money required for the purchase of a domain,\nbut at eleven per cent. For that one, Monsieur des Grassins discounted\nbills of exchange, but at a frightful deduction of interest. Few days\never passed that Monsieur Grandet's name was not mentioned either in the\nmarkets or in social conversations at the evening gatherings. To some\nthe fortune of the old wine-grower was an object of patriotic pride.\nMore than one merchant, more than one innkeeper, said to strangers\nwith a certain complacency: \"Monsieur, we have two or three millionaire\nestablishments; but as for Monsieur Grandet, he does not himself know\nhow much he is worth.\"\n\nIn 1816 the best reckoners in Saumur estimated the landed property of\nthe worthy man at nearly four millions; but as, on an average, he had\nmade yearly, from 1793 to 1817, a hundred thousand francs out of that\nproperty, it was fair to presume that he possessed in actual money a sum\nnearly equal to the value of his estate. So that when, after a game of\nboston or an evening discussion on the matter of vines, the talk fell\nupon Monsieur Grandet, knowing people said: \"Le Pere Grandet? le Pere\nGrandet must have at least five or six millions.\"\n\n\"You are cleverer than I am; I have never been able to find out the\namount,\" answered Monsieur Cruchot or Monsieur des Grassins, when either\nchanced to overhear the remark.\n\nIf some Parisian mentioned Rothschild or Monsieur Lafitte, the people of\nSaumur asked if he were as rich as Monsieur Grandet. When the Parisian,\nwith a smile, tossed them a disdainful affirmative, they looked at each\nother and shook their heads with an incredulous air. So large a fortune\ncovered with a golden mantle all the actions of this man. If in early\ndays some peculiarities of his life gave occasion for laughter or\nridicule, laughter and ridicule had long since died away. His least\nimportant actions had the authority of results repeatedly shown. His\nspeech, his clothing, his gestures, the blinking of his eyes, were law\nto the country-side, where every one, after studying him as a naturalist\nstudies the result of instinct in the lower animals, had come to\nunderstand the deep mute wisdom of his slightest actions.\n\n\"It will be a hard winter,\" said one; \"Pere Grandet has put on his fur\ngloves.\"\n\n\"Pere Grandet is buying quantities of staves; there will be plenty of\nwine this year.\"\n\nMonsieur Grandet never bought either bread or meat. His farmers supplied\nhim weekly with a sufficiency of capons, chickens, eggs, butter, and\nhis tithe of wheat. He owned a mill; and the tenant was bound, over and\nabove his rent, to take a certain quantity of grain and return him the\nflour and bran. La Grande Nanon, his only servant, though she was no\nlonger young, baked the bread of the household herself every Saturday.\nMonsieur Grandet arranged with kitchen-gardeners who were his tenants\nto supply him with vegetables. As to fruits, he gathered such quantities\nthat he sold the greater part in the market. His fire-wood was cut from\nhis own hedgerows or taken from the half-rotten old sheds which he built\nat the corners of his fields, and whose planks the farmers carted into\ntown for him, all cut up, and obligingly stacked in his wood-house,\nreceiving in return his thanks. His only known expenditures were for the\nconsecrated bread, the clothing of his wife and daughter, the hire of\ntheir chairs in church, the wages of la Grand Nanon, the tinning of the\nsaucepans, lights, taxes, repairs on his buildings, and the costs of\nhis various industries. He had six hundred acres of woodland, lately\npurchased, which he induced a neighbor's keeper to watch, under the\npromise of an indemnity. After the acquisition of this property he ate\ngame for the first time.\n\nMonsieur Grandet's manners were very simple. He spoke little. He usually\nexpressed his meaning by short sententious phrases uttered in a soft\nvoice. After the Revolution, the epoch at which he first came into\nnotice, the good man stuttered in a wearisome way as soon as he was\nrequired to speak at length or to maintain an argument. This stammering,\nthe incoherence of his language, the flux of words in which he drowned\nhis thought, his apparent lack of logic, attributed to defects of\neducation, were in reality assumed, and will be sufficiently explained\nby certain events in the following history. Four sentences, precise\nas algebraic formulas, sufficed him usually to grasp and solve all\ndifficulties of life and commerce: \"I don't know; I cannot; I will not;\nI will see about it.\" He never said yes, or no, and never committed\nhimself to writing. If people talked to him he listened coldly, holding\nhis chin in his right hand and resting his right elbow in the back of\nhis left hand, forming in his own mind opinions on all matters, from\nwhich he never receded. He reflected long before making any business\nagreement. When his opponent, after careful conversation, avowed the\nsecret of his own purposes, confident that he had secured his listener's\nassent, Grandet answered: \"I can decide nothing without consulting my\nwife.\" His wife, whom he had reduced to a state of helpless slavery, was\na useful screen to him in business. He went nowhere among friends; he\nneither gave nor accepted dinners; he made no stir or noise, seeming\nto economize in everything, even movement. He never disturbed or\ndisarranged the things of other people, out of respect for the rights\nof property. Nevertheless, in spite of his soft voice, in spite of his\ncircumspect bearing, the language and habits of a coarse nature came\nto the surface, especially in his own home, where he controlled himself\nless than elsewhere.\n\nPhysically, Grandet was a man five feet high, thick-set, square-built,\nwith calves twelve inches in circumference, knotted knee-joints,\nand broad shoulders; his face was round, tanned, and pitted by the\nsmall-pox; his chin was straight, his lips had no curves, his teeth\nwere white; his eyes had that calm, devouring expression which people\nattribute to the basilisk; his forehead, full of transverse wrinkles,\nwas not without certain significant protuberances; his yellow-grayish\nhair was said to be silver and gold by certain young people who did not\nrealize the impropriety of making a jest about Monsieur Grandet. His\nnose, thick at the end, bore a veined wen, which the common people said,\nnot without reason, was full of malice. The whole countenance showed\na dangerous cunning, an integrity without warmth, the egotism of a man\nlong used to concentrate every feeling upon the enjoyments of avarice\nand upon the only human being who was anything whatever to him,--his\ndaughter and sole heiress, Eugenie. Attitude, manners, bearing,\neverything about him, in short, testified to that belief in himself\nwhich the habit of succeeding in all enterprises never fails to give to\na man.\n\nThus, though his manners were unctuous and soft outwardly, Monsieur\nGrandet's nature was of iron. His dress never varied; and those who saw\nhim to-day saw him such as he had been since 1791. His stout shoes\nwere tied with leathern thongs; he wore, in all weathers, thick woollen\nstockings, short breeches of coarse maroon cloth with silver buckles,\na velvet waistcoat, in alternate stripes of yellow and puce, buttoned\nsquarely, a large maroon coat with wide flaps, a black cravat, and\na quaker's hat. His gloves, thick as those of a gendarme, lasted him\ntwenty months; to preserve them, he always laid them methodically on\nthe brim of his hat in one particular spot. Saumur knew nothing further\nabout this personage.\n\nOnly six individuals had a right of entrance to Monsieur Grandet's\nhouse. The most important of the first three was a nephew of Monsieur\nCruchot. Since his appointment as president of the Civil courts of\nSaumur this young man had added the name of Bonfons to that of Cruchot.\nHe now signed himself C. de Bonfons. Any litigant so ill-advised as to\ncall him Monsieur Cruchot would soon be made to feel his folly in court.\nThe magistrate protected those who called him Monsieur le president, but\nhe favored with gracious smiles those who addressed him as Monsieur de\nBonfons. Monsieur le president was thirty-three years old, and possessed\nthe estate of Bonfons (Boni Fontis), worth seven thousand francs a year;\nhe expected to inherit the property of his uncle the notary and that\nof another uncle, the Abbe Cruchot, a dignitary of the chapter of\nSaint-Martin de Tours, both of whom were thought to be very rich. These\nthree Cruchots, backed by a goodly number of cousins, and allied\nto twenty families in the town, formed a party, like the Medici in\nFlorence; like the Medici, the Cruchots had their Pazzi.\n\nMadame des Grassins, mother of a son twenty-three years of age, came\nassiduously to play cards with Madame Grandet, hoping to marry her dear\nAdolphe to Mademoiselle Eugenie. Monsieur des Grassins, the banker,\nvigorously promoted the schemes of his wife by means of secret services\nconstantly rendered to the old miser, and always arrived in time\nupon the field of battle. The three des Grassins likewise had their\nadherents, their cousins, their faithful allies. On the Cruchot side the\nabbe, the Talleyrand of the family, well backed-up by his brother\nthe notary, sharply contested every inch of ground with his female\nadversary, and tried to obtain the rich heiress for his nephew the\npresident.\n\nThis secret warfare between the Cruchots and des Grassins, the prize\nthereof being the hand in marriage of Eugenie Grandet, kept the various\nsocial circles of Saumur in violent agitation. Would Mademoiselle\nGrandet marry Monsieur le president or Monsieur Adolphe des Grassins?\nTo this problem some replied that Monsieur Grandet would never give\nhis daughter to the one or to the other. The old cooper, eaten up with\nambition, was looking, they said, for a peer of France, to whom an\nincome of three hundred thousand francs would make all the past,\npresent, and future casks of the Grandets acceptable. Others replied\nthat Monsieur and Madame des Grassins were nobles, and exceedingly rich;\nthat Adolphe was a personable young fellow; and that unless the old man\nhad a nephew of the pope at his beck and call, such a suitable alliance\nought to satisfy a man who came from nothing,--a man whom Saumur\nremembered with an adze in his hand, and who had, moreover, worn the\n_bonnet rouge_. Certain wise heads called attention to the fact that\nMonsieur Cruchot de Bonfons had the right of entry to the house at all\ntimes, whereas his rival was received only on Sundays. Others, however,\nmaintained that Madame des Grassins was more intimate with the women of\nthe house of Grandet than the Cruchots were, and could put into their\nminds certain ideas which would lead, sooner or later, to success. To\nthis the former retorted that the Abbe Cruchot was the most insinuating\nman in the world: pit a woman against a monk, and the struggle was even.\n\"It is diamond cut diamond,\" said a Saumur wit.\n\nThe oldest inhabitants, wiser than their fellows, declared that the\nGrandets knew better than to let the property go out of the family, and\nthat Mademoiselle Eugenie Grandet of Saumur would be married to the son\nof Monsieur Grandet of Paris, a wealthy wholesale wine-merchant. To this\nthe Cruchotines and the Grassinists replied: \"In the first place, the\ntwo brothers have seen each other only twice in thirty years; and next,\nMonsieur Grandet of Paris has ambitious designs for his son. He is mayor\nof an arrondissement, a deputy, colonel of the National Guard, judge in\nthe commercial courts; he disowns the Grandets of Saumur, and means to\nally himself with some ducal family,--ducal under favor of Napoleon.\"\nIn short, was there anything not said of an heiress who was talked\nof through a circumference of fifty miles, and even in the public\nconveyances from Angers to Blois, inclusively!\n\nAt the beginning of 1811, the Cruchotines won a signal advantage over\nthe Grassinists. The estate of Froidfond, remarkable for its park,\nits mansion, its farms, streams, ponds, forests, and worth about three\nmillions, was put up for sale by the young Marquis de Froidfond, who was\nobliged to liquidate his possessions. Maitre Cruchot, the president, and\nthe abbe, aided by their adherents, were able to prevent the sale of the\nestate in little lots. The notary concluded a bargain with the young\nman for the whole property, payable in gold, persuading him that suits\nwithout number would have to be brought against the purchasers of small\nlots before he could get the money for them; it was better, therefore,\nto sell the whole to Monsieur Grandet, who was solvent and able to pay\nfor the estate in ready money. The fine marquisate of Froidfond was\naccordingly conveyed down the gullet of Monsieur Grandet, who, to the\ngreat astonishment of Saumur, paid for it, under proper discount, with\nthe usual formalities.\n\nThis affair echoed from Nantes to Orleans. Monsieur Grandet took\nadvantage of a cart returning by way of Froidfond to go and see his\nchateau. Having cast a master's eye over the whole property, he returned\nto Saumur, satisfied that he had invested his money at five per cent,\nand seized by the stupendous thought of extending and increasing the\nmarquisate of Froidfond by concentrating all his property there. Then,\nto fill up his coffers, now nearly empty, he resolved to thin out his\nwoods and his forests, and to sell off the poplars in the meadows.\n\n\n\n\nII\n\nIt is now easy to understand the full meaning of the term, \"the house of\nMonsieur Grandet,\"--that cold, silent, pallid dwelling, standing above\nthe town and sheltered by the ruins of the ramparts. The two pillars and\nthe arch, which made the porte-cochere on which the door opened, were\nbuilt, like the house itself, of tufa,--a white stone peculiar to the\nshores of the Loire, and so soft that it lasts hardly more than two\ncenturies. Numberless irregular holes, capriciously bored or eaten out\nby the inclemency of the weather, gave an appearance of the vermiculated\nstonework of French architecture to the arch and the side walls of this\nentrance, which bore some resemblance to the gateway of a jail. Above\nthe arch was a long bas-relief, in hard stone, representing the four\nseasons, the faces already crumbling away and blackened. This bas-relief\nwas surmounted by a projecting plinth, upon which a variety of chance\ngrowths had sprung up,--yellow pellitory, bindweed, convolvuli, nettles,\nplantain, and even a little cherry-tree, already grown to some height.\n\nThe door of the archway was made of solid oak, brown, shrunken, and\nsplit in many places; though frail in appearance, it was firmly held\nin place by a system of iron bolts arranged in symmetrical patterns.\nA small square grating, with close bars red with rust, filled up the\nmiddle panel and made, as it were, a motive for the knocker, fastened to\nit by a ring, which struck upon the grinning head of a huge nail.\nThis knocker, of the oblong shape and kind which our ancestors called\n_jaquemart_, looked like a huge note of exclamation; an antiquary who\nexamined it attentively might have found indications of the figure,\nessentially burlesque, which it once represented, and which long usage\nhad now effaced. Through this little grating--intended in olden times\nfor the recognition of friends in times of civil war--inquisitive\npersons could perceive, at the farther end of the dark and slimy vault,\na few broken steps which led to a garden, picturesquely shut in by\nwalls that were thick and damp, and through which oozed a moisture that\nnourished tufts of sickly herbage. These walls were the ruins of the\nramparts, under which ranged the gardens of several neighboring houses.\n\nThe most important room on the ground-floor of the house was a large\nhall, entered directly from beneath the vault of the porte-cochere.\nFew people know the importance of a hall in the little towns of Anjou,\nTouraine, and Berry. The hall is at one and the same time antechamber,\nsalon, office, boudoir, and dining-room; it is the theatre of domestic\nlife, the common living-room. There the barber of the neighborhood came,\ntwice a year, to cut Monsieur Grandet's hair; there the farmers, the\ncure, the under-prefect, and the miller's boy came on business. This\nroom, with two windows looking on the street, was entirely of wood. Gray\npanels with ancient mouldings covered the walls from top to bottom; the\nceiling showed all its beams, which were likewise painted gray, while\nthe space between them had been washed over in white, now yellow with\nage. An old brass clock, inlaid with arabesques, adorned the mantel\nof the ill-cut white stone chimney-piece, above which was a greenish\nmirror, whose edges, bevelled to show the thickness of the glass,\nreflected a thread of light the whole length of a gothic frame in\ndamascened steel-work. The two copper-gilt candelabra which decorated\nthe corners of the chimney-piece served a double purpose: by taking off\nthe side-branches, each of which held a socket, the main stem--which\nwas fastened to a pedestal of bluish marble tipped with copper--made a\ncandlestick for one candle, which was sufficient for ordinary occasions.\nThe chairs, antique in shape, were covered with tapestry representing\nthe fables of La Fontaine; it was necessary, however, to know that\nwriter well to guess at the subjects, for the faded colors and the\nfigures, blurred by much darning, were difficult to distinguish.\n\nAt the four corners of the hall were closets, or rather buffets,\nsurmounted by dirty shelves. An old card-table in marquetry, of which\nthe upper part was a chess-board, stood in the space between the two\nwindows. Above this table was an oval barometer with a black border\nenlivened with gilt bands, on which the flies had so licentiously\ndisported themselves that the gilding had become problematical. On\nthe panel opposite to the chimney-piece were two portraits in pastel,\nsupposed to represent the grandfather of Madame Grandet, old Monsieur\nde la Bertelliere, as a lieutenant in the French guard, and the deceased\nMadame Gentillet in the guise of a shepherdess. The windows were draped\nwith curtains of red _gros de Tours_ held back by silken cords with\necclesiastical tassels. This luxurious decoration, little in keeping\nwith the habits of Monsieur Grandet, had been, together with the steel\npier-glass, the tapestries, and the buffets, which were of rose-wood,\nincluded in the purchase of the house.\n\nBy the window nearest to the door stood a straw chair, whose legs were\nraised on castors to lift its occupant, Madame Grandet, to a height from\nwhich she could see the passers-by. A work-table of stained cherry-wood\nfilled up the embrasure, and the little armchair of Eugenie Grandet\nstood beside it. In this spot the lives had flowed peacefully onward for\nfifteen years, in a round of constant work from the month of April to\nthe month of November. On the first day of the latter month they took\ntheir winter station by the chimney. Not until that day did Grandet\npermit a fire to be lighted; and on the thirty-first of March it was\nextinguished, without regard either to the chills of the early spring or\nto those of a wintry autumn. A foot-warmer, filled with embers from the\nkitchen fire, which la Grande Nanon contrived to save for them, enabled\nMadame and Mademoiselle Grandet to bear the chilly mornings and evenings\nof April and October. Mother and daughter took charge of the family\nlinen, and spent their days so conscientiously upon a labor properly\nthat of working-women, that if Eugenie wished to embroider a collar for\nher mother she was forced to take the time from sleep, and deceive her\nfather to obtain the necessary light. For a long time the miser had\ngiven out the tallow candle to his daughter and la Grande Nanon just as\nhe gave out every morning the bread and other necessaries for the daily\nconsumption.\n\nLa Grande Nanon was perhaps the only human being capable of accepting\nwillingly the despotism of her master. The whole town envied Monsieur\nand Madame Grandet the possession of her. La Grande Nanon, so called on\naccount of her height, which was five feet eight inches, had lived with\nMonsieur Grandet for thirty-five years. Though she received only sixty\nfrancs a year in wages, she was supposed to be one of the richest\nserving-women in Saumur. Those sixty francs, accumulating through\nthirty-five years, had recently enabled her to invest four thousand\nfrancs in an annuity with Maitre Cruchot. This result of her long and\npersistent economy seemed gigantic. Every servant in the town, seeing\nthat the poor sexagenarian was sure of bread for her old age, was\njealous of her, and never thought of the hard slavery through which it\nhad been won.\n\nAt twenty-two years of age the poor girl had been unable to find a\nsituation, so repulsive was her face to almost every one. Yet the\nfeeling was certainly unjust: the face would have been much admired on\nthe shoulders of a grenadier of the guard; but all things, so they say,\nshould be in keeping. Forced to leave a farm where she kept the cows,\nbecause the dwelling-house was burned down, she came to Saumur to find\na place, full of the robust courage that shrinks from no labor. Le Pere\nGrandet was at that time thinking of marriage and about to set up his\nhousehold. He espied the girl, rejected as she was from door to door.\nA good judge of corporeal strength in his trade as a cooper, he guessed\nthe work that might be got out of a female creature shaped like a\nHercules, as firm on her feet as an oak sixty years old on its roots,\nstrong in the hips, square in the back, with the hands of a cartman and\nan honesty as sound as her unblemished virtue. Neither the warts which\nadorned her martial visage, nor the red-brick tints of her skin, nor the\nsinewy arms, nor the ragged garments of la Grande Nanon, dismayed the\ncooper, who was at that time still of an age when the heart shudders.\nHe fed, shod, and clothed the poor girl, gave her wages, and put her to\nwork without treating her too roughly. Seeing herself thus welcomed,\nla Grande Nanon wept secretly tears of joy, and attached herself in all\nsincerity to her master, who from that day ruled her and worked her with\nfeudal authority. Nanon did everything. She cooked, she made the lye,\nshe washed the linen in the Loire and brought it home on her shoulders;\nshe got up early, she went to bed late; she prepared the food of the\nvine-dressers during the harvest, kept watch upon the market-people,\nprotected the property of her master like a faithful dog, and even, full\nof blind confidence, obeyed without a murmur his most absurd exactions.\n\nIn the famous year of 1811, when the grapes were gathered with\nunheard-of difficulty, Grandet resolved to give Nanon his old\nwatch,--the first present he had made her during twenty years of\nservice. Though he turned over to her his old shoes (which fitted her),\nit is impossible to consider that quarterly benefit as a gift, for the\nshoes were always thoroughly worn-out. Necessity had made the poor girl\nso niggardly that Grandet had grown to love her as we love a dog, and\nNanon had let him fasten a spiked collar round her throat, whose spikes\nno longer pricked her. If Grandet cut the bread with rather too much\nparsimony, she made no complaint; she gaily shared the hygienic benefits\nderived from the severe regime of the household, in which no one was\never ill. Nanon was, in fact, one of the family; she laughed when\nGrandet laughed, felt gloomy or chilly, warmed herself, and toiled as he\ndid. What pleasant compensations there were in such equality! Never did\nthe master have occasion to find fault with the servant for pilfering\nthe grapes, nor for the plums and nectarines eaten under the trees.\n\"Come, fall-to, Nanon!\" he would say in years when the branches bent\nunder the fruit and the farmers were obliged to give it to the pigs.\n\nTo the poor peasant who in her youth had earned nothing but harsh\ntreatment, to the pauper girl picked up by charity, Grandet's ambiguous\nlaugh was like a sunbeam. Moreover, Nanon's simple heart and narrow head\ncould hold only one feeling and one idea. For thirty-five years she had\nnever ceased to see herself standing before the wood-yard of Monsieur\nGrandet, ragged and barefooted, and to hear him say: \"What do you want,\nyoung one?\" Her gratitude was ever new. Sometimes Grandet, reflecting\nthat the poor creature had never heard a flattering word, that she was\nignorant of all the tender sentiments inspired by women, that she might\nsome day appear before the throne of God even more chaste than the\nVirgin Mary herself,--Grandet, struck with pity, would say as he\nlooked at her, \"Poor Nanon!\" The exclamation was always followed by an\nundefinable look cast upon him in return by the old servant. The words,\nuttered from time to time, formed a chain of friendship that nothing\never parted, and to which each exclamation added a link. Such compassion\narising in the heart of the miser, and accepted gratefully by the old\nspinster, had something inconceivably horrible about it. This cruel\npity, recalling, as it did, a thousand pleasures to the heart of the old\ncooper, was for Nanon the sum total of happiness. Who does not likewise\nsay, \"Poor Nanon!\" God will recognize his angels by the inflexions of\ntheir voices and by their secret sighs.\n\nThere were very many households in Saumur where the servants were better\ntreated, but where the masters received far less satisfaction in return.\nThus it was often said: \"What have the Grandets ever done to make their\nGrande Nanon so attached to them? She would go through fire and water\nfor their sake!\" Her kitchen, whose barred windows looked into the\ncourt, was always clean, neat, cold,--a true miser's kitchen, where\nnothing went to waste. When Nanon had washed her dishes, locked up the\nremains of the dinner, and put out her fire, she left the kitchen, which\nwas separated by a passage from the living-room, and went to spin\nhemp beside her masters. One tallow candle sufficed the family for the\nevening. The servant slept at the end of the passage in a species of\ncloset lighted only by a fan-light. Her robust health enabled her to\nlive in this hole with impunity; there she could hear the slightest\nnoise through the deep silence which reigned night and day in that\ndreary house. Like a watch-dog, she slept with one ear open, and took\nher rest with a mind alert.\n\nA description of the other parts of the dwelling will be found connected\nwith the events of this history, though the foregoing sketch of the\nhall, where the whole luxury of the household appears, may enable the\nreader to surmise the nakedness of the upper floors.\n\nIn 1819, at the beginning of an evening in the middle of November, la\nGrande Nanon lighted the fire for the first time. The autumn had\nbeen very fine. This particular day was a fete-day well known to the\nCruchotines and the Grassinists. The six antagonists, armed at all\npoints, were making ready to meet at the Grandets and surpass each other\nin testimonials of friendship. That morning all Saumur had seen Madame\nand Mademoiselle Grandet, accompanied by Nanon, on their way to hear\nMass at the parish church, and every one remembered that the day was\nthe anniversary of Mademoiselle Eugenie's birth. Calculating the hour at\nwhich the family dinner would be over, Maitre Cruchot, the Abbe Cruchot,\nand Monsieur C. de Bonfons hastened to arrive before the des Grassins,\nand be the first to pay their compliments to Mademoiselle Eugenie. All\nthree brought enormous bouquets, gathered in their little green-houses.\nThe stalks of the flowers which the president intended to present were\ningeniously wound round with a white satin ribbon adorned with gold\nfringe. In the morning Monsieur Grandet, following his usual custom on\nthe days that commemorated the birth and the fete of Eugenie, went to\nher bedside and solemnly presented her with his paternal gift,--which\nfor the last thirteen years had consisted regularly of a curious\ngold-piece. Madame Grandet gave her daughter a winter dress or a summer\ndress, as the case might be. These two dresses and the gold-pieces,\nof which she received two others on New Year's day and on her father's\nfete-day, gave Eugenie a little revenue of a hundred crowns or\nthereabouts, which Grandet loved to see her amass. Was it not putting\nhis money from one strong-box to another, and, as it were, training the\nparsimony of his heiress? from whom he sometimes demanded an account\nof her treasure (formerly increased by the gifts of the Bertellieres),\nsaying: \"It is to be your marriage dozen.\"\n\nThe \"marriage dozen\" is an old custom sacredly preserved and still in\nforce in many parts of central France. In Berry and in Anjou, when a\nyoung girl marries, her family, or that of the husband, must give her a\npurse, in which they place, according to their means, twelve pieces,\nor twelve dozen pieces, or twelve hundred pieces of gold. The poorest\nshepherd-girl never marries without her dozen, be it only a dozen\ncoppers. They still tell in Issoudun of a certain \"dozen\" presented to\na rich heiress, which contained a hundred and forty-four _portugaises\nd'or_. Pope Clement VII., uncle of Catherine de' Medici, gave her when\nhe married her to Henri II. a dozen antique gold medals of priceless\nvalue.\n\nDuring dinner the father, delighted to see his Eugenie looking well in a\nnew gown, exclaimed: \"As it is Eugenie's birthday let us have a fire; it\nwill be a good omen.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle will be married this year, that's certain,\" said la\nGrande Nanon, carrying away the remains of the goose,--the pheasant of\ntradesmen.\n\n\"I don't see any one suitable for her in Saumur,\" said Madame Grandet,\nglancing at her husband with a timid look which, considering her years,\nrevealed the conjugal slavery under which the poor woman languished.\n\nGrandet looked at his daughter and exclaimed gaily,--\n\n\"She is twenty-three years old to-day, the child; we must soon begin to\nthink of it.\"\n\nEugenie and her mother silently exchanged a glance of intelligence.\n\nMadame Grandet was a dry, thin woman, as yellow as a quince, awkward,\nslow, one of those women who are born to be down-trodden. She had big\nbones, a big nose, a big forehead, big eyes, and presented at first\nsight a vague resemblance to those mealy fruits that have neither savor\nnor succulence. Her teeth were black and few in number, her mouth was\nwrinkled, her chin long and pointed. She was an excellent woman, a true\nla Bertelliere. L'abbe Cruchot found occasional opportunity to tell her\nthat she had not done ill; and she believed him. Angelic sweetness,\nthe resignation of an insect tortured by children, a rare piety, a good\nheart, an unalterable equanimity of soul, made her universally pitied\nand respected. Her husband never gave her more than six francs at a time\nfor her personal expenses. Ridiculous as it may seem, this woman, who by\nher own fortune and her various inheritances brought Pere Grandet\nmore than three hundred thousand francs, had always felt so profoundly\nhumiliated by her dependence and the slavery in which she lived, against\nwhich the gentleness of her spirit prevented her from revolting, that\nshe had never asked for one penny or made a single remark on the deeds\nwhich Maitre Cruchot brought for her signature. This foolish secret\npride, this nobility of soul perpetually misunderstood and wounded by\nGrandet, ruled the whole conduct of the wife.\n\nMadame Grandet was attired habitually in a gown of greenish levantine\nsilk, endeavoring to make it last nearly a year; with it she wore a\nlarge kerchief of white cotton cloth, a bonnet made of plaited straws\nsewn together, and almost always a black-silk apron. As she seldom left\nthe house she wore out very few shoes. She never asked anything for\nherself. Grandet, seized with occasional remorse when he remembered how\nlong a time had elapsed since he gave her the last six francs, always\nstipulated for the \"wife's pin-money\" when he sold his yearly vintage.\nThe four or five louis presented by the Belgian or the Dutchman who\npurchased the wine were the chief visible signs of Madame Grandet's\nannual revenues. But after she had received the five louis, her husband\nwould often say to her, as though their purse were held in common:\n\"Can you lend me a few sous?\" and the poor woman, glad to be able to do\nsomething for a man whom her confessor held up to her as her lord and\nmaster, returned him in the course of the winter several crowns out of\nthe \"pin-money.\" When Grandet drew from his pocket the five-franc piece\nwhich he allowed monthly for the minor expenses,--thread, needles, and\ntoilet,--of his daughter, he never failed to say as he buttoned his\nbreeches' pocket: \"And you, mother, do you want anything?\"\n\n\"My friend,\" Madame Grandet would answer, moved by a sense of maternal\ndignity, \"we will see about that later.\"\n\nWasted dignity! Grandet thought himself very generous to his wife.\nPhilosophers who meet the like of Nanon, of Madame Grandet, of Eugenie,\nhave surely a right to say that irony is at the bottom of the ways of\nProvidence.\n\nAfter the dinner at which for the first time allusion had been made\nto Eugenie's marriage, Nanon went to fetch a bottle of black-currant\nratafia from Monsieur Grandet's bed-chamber, and nearly fell as she came\ndown the stairs.\n\n\"You great stupid!\" said her master; \"are you going to tumble about like\nother people, hey?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, it was that step on your staircase which has given way.\"\n\n\"She is right,\" said Madame Grandet; \"it ought to have been mended long\nago. Yesterday Eugenie nearly twisted her ankle.\"\n\n\"Here,\" said Grandet to Nanon, seeing that she looked quite pale, \"as it\nis Eugenie's birthday, and you came near falling, take a little glass of\nratafia to set you right.\"\n\n\"Faith! I've earned it,\" said Nanon; \"most people would have broken the\nbottle; but I'd sooner have broken my elbow holding it up high.\"\n\n\"Poor Nanon!\" said Grandet, filling a glass.\n\n\"Did you hurt yourself?\" asked Eugenie, looking kindly at her.\n\n\"No, I didn't fall; I threw myself back on my haunches.\"\n\n\"Well! as it is Eugenie's birthday,\" said Grandet, \"I'll have the step\nmended. You people don't know how to set your foot in the corner where\nthe wood is still firm.\"\n\nGrandet took the candle, leaving his wife, daughter, and servant without\nany other light than that from the hearth, where the flames were lively,\nand went into the bakehouse to fetch planks, nails, and tools.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" cried Nanon, hearing him hammer on the stairs.\n\n\"No, no! I'm an old hand at it,\" answered the former cooper.\n\nAt the moment when Grandet was mending his worm-eaten staircase and\nwhistling with all his might, in remembrance of the days of his youth,\nthe three Cruchots knocked at the door.\n\n\"Is it you, Monsieur Cruchot?\" asked Nanon, peeping through the little\ngrating.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the president.\n\nNanon opened the door, and the light from the hearth, reflected on the\nceiling, enabled the three Cruchots to find their way into the room.\n\n\"Ha! you've come a-greeting,\" said Nanon, smelling the flowers.\n\n\"Excuse me, messieurs,\" cried Grandet, recognizing their voices; \"I'll\nbe with you in a moment. I'm not proud; I am patching up a step on my\nstaircase.\"\n\n\"Go on, go on, Monsieur Grandet; a man's house is his castle,\" said the\npresident sententiously.\n\nMadame and Mademoiselle Grandet rose. The president, profiting by the\ndarkness, said to Eugenie:\n\n\"Will you permit me, mademoiselle, to wish you, on this the day of your\nbirth, a series of happy years and the continuance of the health which\nyou now enjoy?\"\n\nHe offered her a huge bouquet of choice flowers which were rare in\nSaumur; then, taking the heiress by the elbows, he kissed her on each\nside of her neck with a complacency that made her blush. The president,\nwho looked like a rusty iron nail, felt that his courtship was\nprogressing.\n\n\"Don't stand on ceremony,\" said Grandet, entering. \"How well you do\nthings on fete-days, Monsieur le president!\"\n\n\"When it concerns mademoiselle,\" said the abbe, armed with his own\nbouquet, \"every day is a fete-day for my nephew.\"\n\nThe abbe kissed Eugenie's hand. As for Maitre Cruchot, he boldly kissed\nher on both cheeks, remarking: \"How we sprout up, to be sure! Every year\nis twelve months.\"\n\nAs he replaced the candlestick beside the clock, Grandet, who never\nforgot his own jokes, and repeated them to satiety when he thought them\nfunny, said,--\n\n\"As this is Eugenie's birthday let us illuminate.\"\n\nHe carefully took off the branches of the candelabra, put a socket on\neach pedestal, took from Nanon a new tallow candle with paper twisted\nround the end of it, put it into the hollow, made it firm, lit it, and\nthen sat down beside his wife, looking alternately at his friends, his\ndaughter, and the two candles. The Abbe Cruchot, a plump, puffy little\nman, with a red wig plastered down and a face like an old female\ngambler, said as he stretched out his feet, well shod in stout shoes\nwith silver buckles: \"The des Grassins have not come?\"\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Grandet.\n\n\"But are they coming?\" asked the old notary, twisting his face, which\nhad as many holes as a collander, into a queer grimace.\n\n\"I think so,\" answered Madame Grandet.\n\n\"Are your vintages all finished?\" said Monsieur de Bonfons to Grandet.\n\n\"Yes, all of them,\" said the old man, rising to walk up and down the\nroom, his chest swelling with pride as he said the words, \"all of them.\"\nThrough the door of the passage which led to the kitchen he saw la\nGrande Nanon sitting beside her fire with a candle and preparing to spin\nthere, so as not to intrude among the guests.\n\n\"Nanon,\" he said, going into the passage, \"put out that fire and that\ncandle, and come and sit with us. Pardieu! the hall is big enough for\nall.\"\n\n\"But monsieur, you are to have the great people.\"\n\n\"Are not you as good as they? They are descended from Adam, and so are\nyou.\"\n\nGrandet came back to the president and said,--\n\n\"Have you sold your vintage?\"\n\n\"No, not I; I shall keep it. If the wine is good this year, it will\nbe better two years hence. The proprietors, you know, have made an\nagreement to keep up the price; and this year the Belgians won't get the\nbetter of us. Suppose they are sent off empty-handed for once, faith!\nthey'll come back.\"\n\n\"Yes, but let us mind what we are about,\" said Grandet in a tone which\nmade the president tremble.\n\n\"Is he driving some bargain?\" thought Cruchot.\n\nAt this moment the knocker announced the des Grassins family, and\ntheir arrival interrupted a conversation which had begun between Madame\nGrandet and the abbe.\n\nMadame des Grassins was one of those lively, plump little women, with\npink-and-white skins, who, thanks to the claustral calm of the provinces\nand the habits of a virtuous life, keep their youth until they are\npast forty. She was like the last rose of autumn,--pleasant to the\neye, though the petals have a certain frostiness, and their perfume is\nslight. She dressed well, got her fashions from Paris, set the tone to\nSaumur, and gave parties. Her husband, formerly a quartermaster in the\nImperial guard, who had been desperately wounded at Austerlitz, and had\nsince retired, still retained, in spite of his respect for Grandet, the\nseeming frankness of an old soldier.\n\n\"Good evening, Grandet,\" he said, holding out his hand and affecting\na sort of superiority, with which he always crushed the Cruchots.\n\"Mademoiselle,\" he added, turning to Eugenie, after bowing to Madame\nGrandet, \"you are always beautiful and good, and truly I do not know\nwhat to wish you.\" So saying, he offered her a little box which his\nservant had brought and which contained a Cape heather,--a flower lately\nimported into Europe and very rare.\n\nMadame des Grassins kissed Eugenie very affectionately, pressed her\nhand, and said: \"Adolphe wishes to make you my little offering.\"\n\nA tall, blond young man, pale and slight, with tolerable manners and\nseemingly rather shy, although he had just spent eight or ten thousand\nfrancs over his allowance in Paris, where he had been sent to study\nlaw, now came forward and kissed Eugenie on both cheeks, offering her a\nworkbox with utensils in silver-gilt,--mere show-case trumpery, in\nspite of the monogram E.G. in gothic letters rather well engraved,\nwhich belonged properly to something in better taste. As she opened it,\nEugenie experienced one of those unexpected and perfect delights which\nmake a young girl blush and quiver and tremble with pleasure. She\nturned her eyes to her father as if to ask permission to accept it, and\nMonsieur Grandet replied: \"Take it, my daughter,\" in a tone which would\nhave made an actor illustrious.\n\nThe three Cruchots felt crushed as they saw the joyous, animated look\ncast upon Adolphe des Grassins by the heiress, to whom such riches were\nunheard-of. Monsieur des Grassins offered Grandet a pinch of snuff,\ntook one himself, shook off the grains as they fell on the ribbon of\nthe Legion of honor which was attached to the button-hole of his blue\nsurtout; then he looked at the Cruchots with an air that seemed to say,\n\"Parry that thrust if you can!\" Madame des Grassins cast her eyes on the\nblue vases which held the Cruchot bouquets, looking at the enemy's\ngifts with the pretended interest of a satirical woman. At this delicate\njuncture the Abbe Cruchot left the company seated in a circle round the\nfire and joined Grandet at the lower end of the hall. As the two men\nreached the embrasure of the farthest window the priest said in the\nmiser's ear: \"Those people throw money out of the windows.\"\n\n\"What does that matter if it gets into my cellar?\" retorted the old\nwine-grower.\n\n\"If you want to give gilt scissors to your daughter, you have the\nmeans,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"I give her something better than scissors,\" answered Grandet.\n\n\"My nephew is a blockhead,\" thought the abbe as he looked at the\npresident, whose rumpled hair added to the ill grace of his brown\ncountenance. \"Couldn't he have found some little trifle which cost\nmoney?\"\n\n\"We will join you at cards, Madame Grandet,\" said Madame des Grassins.\n\n\"We might have two tables, as we are all here.\"\n\n\"As it is Eugenie's birthday you had better play loto all together,\"\nsaid Pere Grandet: \"the two young ones can join\"; and the old cooper,\nwho never played any game, motioned to his daughter and Adolphe. \"Come,\nNanon, set the tables.\"\n\n\"We will help you, Mademoiselle Nanon,\" said Madame des Grassins gaily,\nquite joyous at the joy she had given Eugenie.\n\n\"I have never in my life been so pleased,\" the heiress said to her; \"I\nhave never seen anything so pretty.\"\n\n\"Adolphe brought it from Paris, and he chose it,\" Madame des Grassins\nwhispered in her ear.\n\n\"Go on! go on! damned intriguing thing!\" thought the president. \"If you\never have a suit in court, you or your husband, it shall go hard with\nyou.\"\n\nThe notary, sitting in his corner, looked calmly at the abbe, saying\nto himself: \"The des Grassins may do what they like; my property and my\nbrother's and that of my nephew amount in all to eleven hundred thousand\nfrancs. The des Grassins, at the most, have not half that; besides,\nthey have a daughter. They may give what presents they like; heiress and\npresents too will be ours one of these days.\"\n\nAt half-past eight in the evening the two card-tables were set out.\nMadame des Grassins succeeded in putting her son beside Eugenie. The\nactors in this scene, so full of interest, commonplace as it seems, were\nprovided with bits of pasteboard striped in many colors and numbered,\nand with counters of blue glass, and they appeared to be listening\nto the jokes of the notary, who never drew a number without making\na remark, while in fact they were all thinking of Monsieur Grandet's\nmillions. The old cooper, with inward self-conceit, was contemplating\nthe pink feathers and the fresh toilet of Madame des Grassins, the\nmartial head of the banker, the faces of Adolphe, the president, the\nabbe, and the notary, saying to himself:--\n\n\"They are all after my money. Hey! neither the one nor the other shall\nhave my daughter; but they are useful--useful as harpoons to fish with.\"\n\nThis family gaiety in the old gray room dimly lighted by two\ntallow candles; this laughter, accompanied by the whirr of Nanon's\nspinning-wheel, sincere only upon the lips of Eugenie or her mother;\nthis triviality mingled with important interests; this young girl, who,\nlike certain birds made victims of the price put upon them, was\nnow lured and trapped by proofs of friendship of which she was the\ndupe,--all these things contributed to make the scene a melancholy\ncomedy. Is it not, moreover, a drama of all times and all places, though\nhere brought down to its simplest expression? The figure of Grandet,\nplaying his own game with the false friendship of the two families and\ngetting enormous profits from it, dominates the scene and throws\nlight upon it. The modern god,--the only god in whom faith is\npreserved,--money, is here, in all its power, manifested in a single\ncountenance. The tender sentiments of life hold here but a secondary\nplace; only the three pure, simple hearts of Nanon, of Eugenie, and of\nher mother were inspired by them. And how much of ignorance there was in\nthe simplicity of these poor women! Eugenie and her mother knew nothing\nof Grandet's wealth; they could only estimate the things of life by the\nglimmer of their pale ideas, and they neither valued nor despised money,\nbecause they were accustomed to do without it. Their feelings, bruised,\nthough they did not know it, but ever-living, were the secret spring of\ntheir existence, and made them curious exceptions in the midst of these\nother people whose lives were purely material. Frightful condition of\nthe human race! there is no one of its joys that does not come from some\nspecies of ignorance.\n\nAt the moment when Madame Grandet had won a loto of sixteen sous,--the\nlargest ever pooled in that house,--and while la Grande Nanon was\nlaughing with delight as she watched madame pocketing her riches, the\nknocker resounded on the house-door with such a noise that the women all\njumped in their chairs.\n\n\"There is no man in Saumur who would knock like that,\" said the notary.\n\n\"How can they bang in that way!\" exclaimed Nanon; \"do they want to break\nin the door?\"\n\n\"Who the devil is it?\" cried Grandet.\n\n\n\n\nIII\n\nNanon took one of the candles and went to open the door, followed by her\nmaster.\n\n\"Grandet! Grandet!\" cried his wife, moved by a sudden impulse of fear,\nand running to the door of the room.\n\nAll the players looked at each other.\n\n\"Suppose we all go?\" said Monsieur des Grassins; \"that knock strikes me\nas evil-intentioned.\"\n\nHardly was Monsieur des Grassins allowed to see the figure of a young\nman, accompanied by a porter from the coach-office carrying two large\ntrunks and dragging a carpet-bag after him, than Monsieur Grandet turned\nroughly on his wife and said,--\n\n\"Madame Grandet, go back to your loto; leave me to speak with monsieur.\"\n\nThen he pulled the door quickly to, and the excited players returned to\ntheir seats, but did not continue the game.\n\n\"Is it any one belonging to Saumur, Monsieur des Grassins?\" asked his\nwife.\n\n\"No, it is a traveller.\"\n\n\"He must have come from Paris.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the notary, pulling out his watch, which was two inches\nthick and looked like a Dutch man-of-war; \"it's nine o'clock; the\ndiligence of the Grand Bureau is never late.\"\n\n\"Is the gentleman young?\" inquired the Abbe Cruchot.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Monsieur des Grassins, \"and he has brought luggage which\nmust weigh nearly three tons.\"\n\n\"Nanon does not come back,\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"It must be one of your relations,\" remarked the president.\n\n\"Let us go on with our game,\" said Madame Grandet gently. \"I know from\nMonsieur Grandet's tone of voice that he is annoyed; perhaps he would\nnot like to find us talking of his affairs.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Adolphe to his neighbor, \"it is no doubt your\ncousin Grandet,--a very good-looking young man; I met him at the ball of\nMonsieur de Nucingen.\" Adolphe did not go on, for his mother trod on his\ntoes; and then, asking him aloud for two sous to put on her stake, she\nwhispered: \"Will you hold your tongue, you great goose!\"\n\nAt this moment Grandet returned, without la Grande Nanon, whose steps,\ntogether with those of the porter, echoed up the staircase; and he was\nfollowed by the traveller who had excited such curiosity and so filled\nthe lively imaginations of those present that his arrival at this\ndwelling, and his sudden fall into the midst of this assembly, can only\nbe likened to that of a snail into a beehive, or the introduction of a\npeacock into some village poultry-yard.\n\n\"Sit down near the fire,\" said Grandet.\n\nBefore seating himself, the young stranger saluted the assembled company\nvery gracefully. The men rose to answer by a courteous inclination, and\nthe women made a ceremonious bow.\n\n\"You are cold, no doubt, monsieur,\" said Madame Grandet; \"you have,\nperhaps, travelled from--\"\n\n\"Just like all women!\" said the old wine-grower, looking up from a\nletter he was reading. \"Do let monsieur rest himself!\"\n\n\"But, father, perhaps monsieur would like to take something,\" said\nEugenie.\n\n\"He has got a tongue,\" said the old man sternly.\n\nThe stranger was the only person surprised by this scene; all the others\nwere well-used to the despotic ways of the master. However, after the\ntwo questions and the two replies had been exchanged, the newcomer rose,\nturned his back towards the fire, lifted one foot so as to warm the sole\nof its boot, and said to Eugenie,--\n\n\"Thank you, my cousin, but I dined at Tours. And,\" he added, looking at\nGrandet, \"I need nothing; I am not even tired.\"\n\n\"Monsieur has come from the capital?\" asked Madame des Grassins.\n\nMonsieur Charles,--such was the name of the son of Monsieur Grandet of\nParis,--hearing himself addressed, took a little eye-glass, suspended by\na chain from his neck, applied it to his right eye to examine what was\non the table, and also the persons sitting round it. He ogled Madame des\nGrassins with much impertinence, and said to her, after he had observed\nall he wished,--\n\n\"Yes, madame. You are playing at loto, aunt,\" he added. \"Do not let me\ninterrupt you, I beg; go on with your game: it is too amusing to leave.\"\n\n\"I was certain it was the cousin,\" thought Madame des Grassins, casting\nrepeated glances at him.\n\n\"Forty-seven!\" cried the old abbe. \"Mark it down, Madame des Grassins.\nIsn't that your number?\"\n\nMonsieur des Grassins put a counter on his wife's card, who sat watching\nfirst the cousin from Paris and then Eugenie, without thinking of her\nloto, a prey to mournful presentiments. From time to time the young\nheiress glanced furtively at her cousin, and the banker's wife easily\ndetected a _crescendo_ of surprise and curiosity in her mind.\n\nMonsieur Charles Grandet, a handsome young man of twenty-two, presented\nat this moment a singular contrast to the worthy provincials, who,\nconsiderably disgusted by his aristocratic manners, were all studying\nhim with sarcastic intent. This needs an explanation. At twenty-two,\nyoung people are still so near childhood that they often conduct\nthemselves childishly. In all probability, out of every hundred of\nthem fully ninety-nine would have behaved precisely as Monsieur Charles\nGrandet was now behaving.\n\nSome days earlier than this his father had told him to go and spend\nseveral months with his uncle at Saumur. Perhaps Monsieur Grandet was\nthinking of Eugenie. Charles, sent for the first time in his life into\nthe provinces, took a fancy to make his appearance with the superiority\nof a man of fashion, to reduce the whole arrondissement to despair by\nhis luxury, and to make his visit an epoch, importing into those country\nregions all the refinements of Parisian life. In short, to explain it in\none word, he mean to pass more time at Saumur in brushing his nails than\nhe ever thought of doing in Paris, and to assume the extra nicety and\nelegance of dress which a young man of fashion often lays aside for\na certain negligence which in itself is not devoid of grace. Charles\ntherefore brought with him a complete hunting-costume, the finest gun,\nthe best hunting-knife in the prettiest sheath to be found in all\nParis. He brought his whole collection of waistcoats. They were of all\nkinds,--gray, black, white, scarabaeus-colored: some were shot with\ngold, some spangled, some _chined_; some were double-breasted and\ncrossed like a shawl, others were straight in the collar; some had\nturned-over collars, some buttoned up to the top with gilt buttons. He\nbrought every variety of collar and cravat in fashion at that epoch. He\nbrought two of Buisson's coats and all his finest linen He brought his\npretty gold toilet-set,--a present from his mother. He brought all his\ndandy knick-knacks, not forgetting a ravishing little desk presented to\nhim by the most amiable of women,--amiable for him, at least,--a fine\nlady whom he called Annette and who at this moment was travelling,\nmatrimonially and wearily, in Scotland, a victim to certain suspicions\nwhich required a passing sacrifice of happiness; in the desk was much\npretty note-paper on which to write to her once a fortnight.\n\nIn short, it was as complete a cargo of Parisian frivolities as it was\npossible for him to get together,--a collection of all the implements\nof husbandry with which the youth of leisure tills his life, from\nthe little whip which helps to begin a duel, to the handsomely chased\npistols which end it. His father having told him to travel alone and\nmodestly, he had taken the coupe of the diligence all to himself, rather\npleased at not having to damage a delightful travelling-carriage ordered\nfor a journey on which he was to meet his Annette, the great lady\nwho, etc.,--whom he intended to rejoin at Baden in the following June.\nCharles expected to meet scores of people at his uncle's house, to hunt\nin his uncle's forests,--to live, in short, the usual chateau life; he\ndid not know that his uncle was in Saumur, and had only inquired about\nhim incidentally when asking the way to Froidfond. Hearing that he was\nin town, he supposed that he should find him in a suitable mansion.\n\nIn order that he might make a becoming first appearance before his\nuncle either at Saumur or at Froidfond, he had put on his most elegant\ntravelling attire, simple yet exquisite,--\"adorable,\" to use the word\nwhich in those days summed up the special perfections of a man or a\nthing. At Tours a hairdresser had re-curled his beautiful chestnut\nlocks; there he changed his linen and put on a black satin cravat,\nwhich, combined with a round shirt-collar, framed his fair and smiling\ncountenance agreeably. A travelling great-coat, only half buttoned up,\nnipped in his waist and disclosed a cashmere waistcoat crossed in\nfront, beneath which was another waistcoat of white material. His watch,\nnegligently slipped into a pocket, was fastened by a short gold chain to\na buttonhole. His gray trousers, buttoned up at the sides, were set\noff at the seams with patterns of black silk embroidery. He gracefully\ntwirled a cane, whose chased gold knob did not mar the freshness of his\ngray gloves. And to complete all, his cap was in excellent taste. None\nbut a Parisian, and a Parisian of the upper spheres, could thus array\nhimself without appearing ridiculous; none other could give the harmony\nof self-conceit to all these fopperies, which were carried off, however,\nwith a dashing air,--the air of a young man who has fine pistols, a sure\naim, and Annette.\n\nNow if you wish to understand the mutual amazement of the provincial\nparty and the young Parisian; if you would clearly see the brilliance\nwhich the traveller's elegance cast among the gray shadows of the room\nand upon the faces of this family group,--endeavor to picture to your\nminds the Cruchots. All three took snuff, and had long ceased to repress\nthe habit of snivelling or to remove the brown blotches which strewed\nthe frills of their dingy shirts and the yellowing creases of their\ncrumpled collars. Their flabby cravats were twisted into ropes as soon\nas they wound them about their throats. The enormous quantity of linen\nwhich allowed these people to have their clothing washed only once\nin six months, and to keep it during that time in the depths of their\nclosets, also enabled time to lay its grimy and decaying stains upon\nit. There was perfect unison of ill-grace and senility about them; their\nfaces, as faded as their threadbare coats, as creased as their trousers,\nwere worn-out, shrivelled-up, and puckered. As for the others, the\ngeneral negligence of their dress, which was incomplete and wanting\nin freshness,--like the toilet of all country places, where insensibly\npeople cease to dress for others and come to think seriously of the\nprice of a pair of gloves,--was in keeping with the negligence of\nthe Cruchots. A horror of fashion was the only point on which the\nGrassinists and the Cruchotines agreed.\n\nWhen the Parisian took up his eye-glass to examine the strange\naccessories of this dwelling,--the joists of the ceiling, the color\nof the woodwork, and the specks which the flies had left there in\nsufficient number to punctuate the \"Moniteur\" and the \"Encyclopaedia of\nSciences,\"--the loto-players lifted their noses and looked at him with\nas much curiosity as they might have felt about a giraffe. Monsieur des\nGrassins and his son, to whom the appearance of a man of fashion was not\nwholly unknown, were nevertheless as much astonished as their neighbors,\nwhether it was that they fell under the indefinable influence of the\ngeneral feeling, or that they really shared it as with satirical glances\nthey seemed to say to their compatriots,--\n\n\"That is what you see in Paris!\"\n\nThey were able to examine Charles at their leisure without fearing to\ndisplease the master of the house. Grandet was absorbed in the long\nletter which he held in his hand; and to read it he had taken the\nonly candle upon the card-table, paying no heed to his guests or their\npleasure. Eugenie, to whom such a type of perfection, whether of dress\nor of person, was absolutely unknown, thought she beheld in her cousin\na being descended from seraphic spheres. She inhaled with delight the\nfragrance wafted from the graceful curls of that brilliant head. She\nwould have liked to touch the soft kid of the delicate gloves. She\nenvied Charles his small hands, his complexion, the freshness and\nrefinement of his features. In short,--if it is possible to sum up\nthe effect this elegant being produced upon an ignorant young girl\nperpetually employed in darning stockings or in mending her father's\nclothes, and whose life flowed on beneath these unclean rafters, seeing\nnone but occasional passers along the silent street,--this vision of\nher cousin roused in her soul an emotion of delicate desire like that\ninspired in a young man by the fanciful pictures of women drawn by\nWestall for the English \"Keepsakes,\" and that engraved by the Findens\nwith so clever a tool that we fear, as we breathe upon the paper, that\nthe celestial apparitions may be wafted away. Charles drew from his\npocket a handkerchief embroidered by the great lady now travelling in\nScotland. As Eugenie saw this pretty piece of work, done in the vacant\nhours which were lost to love, she looked at her cousin to see if it\nwere possible that he meant to make use of it. The manners of the\nyoung man, his gestures, the way in which he took up his eye-glass, his\naffected superciliousness, his contemptuous glance at the coffer which\nhad just given so much pleasure to the rich heiress, and which he\nevidently regarded as without value, or even as ridiculous,--all these\nthings, which shocked the Cruchots and the des Grassins, pleased Eugenie\nso deeply that before she slept she dreamed long dreams of her phoenix\ncousin.\n\nThe loto-numbers were drawn very slowly, and presently the game came\nsuddenly to an end. La Grand Nanon entered and said aloud: \"Madame, I\nwant the sheets for monsieur's bed.\"\n\nMadame Grandet followed her out. Madame des Grassins said in a low\nvoice: \"Let us keep our sous and stop playing.\" Each took his or her two\nsous from the chipped saucer in which they had been put; then the party\nmoved in a body toward the fire.\n\n\"Have you finished your game?\" said Grandet, without looking up from his\nletter.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" replied Madame des Grassins, taking a seat near Charles.\n\nEugenie, prompted by a thought often born in the heart of a young girl\nwhen sentiment enters it for the first time, left the room to go and\nhelp her mother and Nanon. Had an able confessor then questioned her\nshe would, no doubt, have avowed to him that she thought neither of her\nmother nor of Nanon, but was pricked by a poignant desire to look after\nher cousin's room and concern herself with her cousin; to supply what\nmight be needed, to remedy any forgetfulness, to see that all was done\nto make it, as far as possible, suitable and elegant; and, in fact, she\narrived in time to prove to her mother and Nanon that everything still\nremained to be done. She put into Nanon's head the notion of passing a\nwarming-pan between the sheets. She herself covered the old table with a\ncloth and requested Nanon to change it every morning; she convinced her\nmother that it was necessary to light a good fire, and persuaded Nanon\nto bring up a great pile of wood into the corridor without saying\nanything to her father. She ran to get, from one of the corner-shelves\nof the hall, a tray of old lacquer which was part of the inheritance\nof the late Monsieur de la Bertelliere, catching up at the same time\na six-sided crystal goblet, a little tarnished gilt spoon, an antique\nflask engraved with cupids, all of which she put triumphantly on the\ncorner of her cousin's chimney-piece. More ideas surged through her head\nin one quarter of an hour than she had ever had since she came into the\nworld.\n\n\"Mamma,\" she said, \"my cousin will never bear the smell of a tallow\ncandle; suppose we buy a wax one?\" And she darted, swift as a bird, to\nget the five-franc piece which she had just received for her monthly\nexpenses. \"Here, Nanon,\" she cried, \"quick!\"\n\n\"What will your father say?\" This terrible remonstrance was uttered\nby Madame Grandet as she beheld her daughter armed with an old\nSevres sugar-basin which Grandet had brought home from the chateau of\nFroidfond. \"And where will you get the sugar? Are you crazy?\"\n\n\"Mamma, Nanon can buy some sugar as well as the candle.\"\n\n\"But your father?\"\n\n\"Surely his nephew ought not to go without a glass of _eau sucree_?\nBesides, he will not notice it.\"\n\n\"Your father sees everything,\" said Madame Grandet, shaking her head.\n\nNanon hesitated; she knew her master.\n\n\"Come, Nanon, go,--because it is my birthday.\"\n\nNanon gave a loud laugh as she heard the first little jest her young\nmistress had ever made, and then obeyed her.\n\nWhile Eugenie and her mother were trying to embellish the bedroom\nassigned by Monsieur Grandet for his nephew, Charles himself was the\nobject of Madame des Grassins' attentions; to all appearances she was\nsetting her cap at him.\n\n\"You are very courageous, monsieur,\" she said to the young dandy, \"to\nleave the pleasures of the capital at this season and take up your abode\nin Saumur. But if we do not frighten you away, you will find there are\nsome amusements even here.\"\n\nShe threw him the ogling glance of the provinces, where women put so\nmuch prudence and reserve into their eyes that they impart to them the\nprudish concupiscence peculiar to certain ecclesiastics to whom all\npleasure is either a theft or an error. Charles was so completely out\nof his element in this abode, and so far from the vast chateau and the\nsumptuous life with which his fancy had endowed his uncle, that as he\nlooked at Madame des Grassins he perceived a dim likeness to Parisian\nfaces. He gracefully responded to the species of invitation addressed\nto him, and began very naturally a conversation, in which Madame des\nGrassins gradually lowered her voice so as to bring it into harmony with\nthe nature of the confidences she was making. With her, as with Charles,\nthere was the need of conference; so after a few moments spent in\ncoquettish phrases and a little serious jesting, the clever provincial\nsaid, thinking herself unheard by the others, who were discussing the\nsale of wines which at that season filled the heads of every one in\nSaumur,--\n\n\"Monsieur if you will do us the honor to come and see us, you will give\nas much pleasure to my husband as to myself. Our salon is the only one\nin Saumur where you will find the higher business circles mingling with\nthe nobility. We belong to both societies, who meet at our house simply\nbecause they find it amusing. My husband--I say it with pride--is as\nmuch valued by the one class as by the other. We will try to relieve\nthe monotony of your visit here. If you stay all the time with Monsieur\nGrandet, good heavens! what will become of you? Your uncle is a sordid\nmiser who thinks of nothing but his vines; your aunt is a pious soul who\ncan't put two ideas together; and your cousin is a little fool, without\neducation, perfectly common, no fortune, who will spend her life in\ndarning towels.\"\n\n\"She is really very nice, this woman,\" thought Charles Grandet as he\nduly responded to Madame des Grassins' coquetries.\n\n\"It seems to me, wife, that you are taking possession of monsieur,\" said\nthe stout banker, laughing.\n\nOn this remark the notary and the president said a few words that were\nmore or less significant; but the abbe, looking at them slyly, brought\ntheir thoughts to a focus by taking a pinch of snuff and saying as\nhe handed round his snuff-box: \"Who can do the honors of Saumur for\nmonsieur so well as madame?\"\n\n\"Ah! what do you mean by that, monsieur l'abbe?\" demanded Monsieur des\nGrassins.\n\n\"I mean it in the best possible sense for you, for madame, for the town\nof Saumur, and for monsieur,\" said the wily old man, turning to Charles.\n\nThe Abbe Cruchot had guessed the conversation between Charles and Madame\ndes Grassins without seeming to pay attention to it.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said Adolphe to Charles with an air which he tried to make\nfree and easy, \"I don't know whether you remember me, but I had the\nhonor of dancing as your _vis-a-vis_ at a ball given by the Baron de\nNucingen, and--\"\n\n\"Perfectly; I remember perfectly, monsieur,\" answered Charles, pleased\nto find himself the object of general attention.\n\n\"Monsieur is your son?\" he said to Madame des Grassins.\n\nThe abbe looked at her maliciously.\n\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" she answered.\n\n\"Then you were very young when you were in Paris?\" said Charles,\naddressing Adolphe.\n\n\"You must know, monsieur,\" said the abbe, \"that we send them to Babylon\nas soon as they are weaned.\"\n\nMadame des Grassins examined the abbe with a glance of extreme\npenetration.\n\n\"It is only in the provinces,\" he continued, \"that you will find women\nof thirty and more years as fresh as madame, here, with a son about to\ntake his degree. I almost fancy myself back in the days when the young\nmen stood on chairs in the ball-room to see you dance, madame,\" said the\nabbe, turning to his female adversary. \"To me, your triumphs are but of\nyesterday--\"\n\n\"The old rogue!\" thought Madame Grassins; \"can he have guessed my\nintentions?\"\n\n\"It seems that I shall have a good deal of success in Saumur,\" thought\nCharles as he unbuttoned his great-coat, put a hand into his waistcoat,\nand cast a glance into the far distance, to imitate the attitude which\nChantrey has given to Lord Byron.\n\nThe inattention of Pere Grandet, or, to speak more truly, the\npreoccupation of mind into which the reading of the letter had plunged\nhim, did not escape the vigilance of the notary and the president, who\ntried to guess the contents of the letter by the almost imperceptible\nmotions of the miser's face, which was then under the full light of the\ncandle. He maintained the habitual calm of his features with evident\ndifficulty; we may, in fact, picture to ourselves the countenance such\na man endeavored to preserve as he read the fatal letter which here\nfollows:--\n\n  My Brother,--It is almost twenty-three years since we have seen\n  each other. My marriage was the occasion of our last interview,\n  after which we parted, and both of us were happy. Assuredly I\n  could not then foresee that you would one day be the prop of the\n  family whose prosperity you then predicted.\n\n  When you hold this letter within your hands I shall be no longer\n  living. In the position I now hold I cannot survive the disgrace\n  of bankruptcy. I have waited on the edge of the gulf until the\n  last moment, hoping to save myself. The end has come, I must sink\n  into it. The double bankruptcies of my broker and of Roguin, my\n  notary, have carried off my last resources and left me nothing. I\n  have the bitterness of owing nearly four millions, with assets not\n  more than twenty-five per cent in value to pay them. The wines in\n  my warehouses suffer from the fall in prices caused by the\n  abundance and quality of your vintage. In three days Paris will\n  cry out: \"Monsieur Grandet was a knave!\" and I, an honest man,\n  shall be lying in my winding-sheet of infamy. I deprive my son of\n  a good name, which I have stained, and the fortune of his mother,\n  which I have lost. He knows nothing of all this,--my unfortunate\n  child whom I idolize! We parted tenderly. He was ignorant,\n  happily, that the last beatings of my heart were spent in that\n  farewell. Will he not some day curse me? My brother, my brother!\n  the curses of our children are horrible; they can appeal against\n  ours, but theirs are irrevocable. Grandet, you are my elder\n  brother, you owe me your protection; act for me so that Charles\n  may cast no bitter words upon my grave! My brother, if I were\n  writing with my blood, with my tears, no greater anguish could I\n  put into this letter,--nor as great, for then I should weep, I\n  should bleed, I should die, I should suffer no more, but now I\n  suffer and look at death with dry eyes.\n\n  From henceforth you are my son's father; he has no relations, as\n  you well know, on his mother's side. Why did I not consider social\n  prejudices? Why did I yield to love? Why did I marry the natural\n  daughter of a great lord? Charles has no family. Oh, my unhappy\n  son! my son! Listen, Grandet! I implore nothing for myself,\n  --besides, your property may not be large enough to carry a mortgage\n  of three millions,--but for my son! Brother, my suppliant hands\n  are clasped as I think of you; behold them! Grandet, I confide my\n  son to you in dying, and I look at the means of death with less\n  pain as I think that you will be to him a father. He loved me\n  well, my Charles; I was good to him, I never thwarted him; he will\n  not curse me. Ah, you see! he is gentle, he is like his mother, he\n  will cause you no grief. Poor boy! accustomed to all the\n  enjoyments of luxury, he knows nothing of the privations to which\n  you and I were condemned by the poverty of our youth. And I leave\n  him ruined! alone! Yes, all my friends will avoid him, and it is I\n  who have brought this humiliation upon him! Would that I had the\n  force to send him with one thrust into the heavens to his mother's\n  side! Madness! I come back to my disaster--to his. I send him to\n  you that you may tell him in some fitting way of my death, of his\n  future fate. Be a father to him, but a good father. Do not tear\n  him all at once from his idle life, it would kill him. I beg him\n  on my knees to renounce all rights that, as his mother's heir, he\n  may have on my estate. But the prayer is superfluous; he is\n  honorable, and he will feel that he must not appear among my\n  creditors. Bring him to see this at the right time; reveal to him\n  the hard conditions of the life I have made for him: and if he\n  still has tender thoughts of me, tell him in my name that all is\n  not lost for him. Yes, work, labor, which saved us both, may give\n  him back the fortune of which I have deprived him; and if he\n  listens to his father's voice as it reaches him from the grave, he\n  will go the Indies. My brother, Charles is an upright and\n  courageous young man; give him the wherewithal to make his\n  venture; he will die sooner than not repay you the funds which you\n  may lend him. Grandet! if you will not do this, you will lay up\n  for yourself remorse. Ah, should my child find neither tenderness\n  nor succor in you, I would call down the vengeance of God upon\n  your cruelty!\n\n  If I had been able to save something from the wreck, I might have\n  had the right to leave him at least a portion of his mother's\n  property; but my last monthly payments have absorbed everything. I\n  did not wish to die uncertain of my child's fate; I hoped to feel\n  a sacred promise in a clasp of your hand which might have warmed\n  my heart: but time fails me. While Charles is journeying to you I\n  shall be preparing my assignment. I shall endeavor to show by the\n  order and good faith of my accounts that my disaster comes neither\n  from a faulty life nor from dishonesty. It is for my son's sake\n  that I strive to do this.\n\n  Farewell, my brother! May the blessing of God be yours for the\n  generous guardianship I lay upon you, and which, I doubt not, you\n  will accept. A voice will henceforth and forever pray for you in\n  that world where we must all go, and where I am now as you read\n  these lines.\n\nVictor-Ange-Guillaume Grandet.\n\n\n\"So you are talking?\" said Pere Grandet as he carefully folded the\nletter in its original creases and put it into his waistcoat-pocket. He\nlooked at his nephew with a humble, timid air, beneath which he hid his\nfeelings and his calculations. \"Have you warmed yourself?\" he said to\nhim.\n\n\"Thoroughly, my dear uncle.\"\n\n\"Well, where are the women?\" said his uncle, already forgetting that\nhis nephew was to sleep at the house. At this moment Eugenie and Madame\nGrandet returned.\n\n\"Is the room all ready?\" said Grandet, recovering his composure.\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"Well then, my nephew, if you are tired, Nanon shall show you your room.\nIt isn't a dandy's room; but you will excuse a poor wine-grower who\nnever has a penny to spare. Taxes swallow up everything.\"\n\n\"We do not wish to intrude, Grandet,\" said the banker; \"you may want to\ntalk to your nephew, and therefore we will bid you good-night.\"\n\nAt these words the assembly rose, and each made a parting bow in keeping\nwith his or her own character. The old notary went to the door to fetch\nhis lantern and came back to light it, offering to accompany the des\nGrassins on their way. Madame des Grassins had not foreseen the incident\nwhich brought the evening prematurely to an end, her servant therefore\nhad not arrived.\n\n\"Will you do me the honor to take my arm, madame?\" said the abbe.\n\n\"Thank you, monsieur l'abbe, but I have my son,\" she answered dryly.\n\n\"Ladies cannot compromise themselves with me,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"Take Monsieur Cruchot's arm,\" said her husband.\n\nThe abbe walked off with the pretty lady so quickly that they were soon\nsome distance in advance of the caravan.\n\n\"That is a good-looking young man, madame,\" he said, pressing her arm.\n\"Good-by to the grapes, the vintage is done. It is all over with us. We\nmay as well say adieu to Mademoiselle Grandet. Eugenie will belong to\nthe dandy. Unless this cousin is enamoured of some Parisian woman, your\nson Adolphe will find another rival in--\"\n\n\"Not at all, monsieur l'abbe. This young man cannot fail to see that\nEugenie is a little fool,--a girl without the least freshness. Did you\nnotice her to-night? She was as yellow as a quince.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you made the cousin notice it?\"\n\n\"I did not take the trouble--\"\n\n\"Place yourself always beside Eugenie, madame, and you need never take\nthe trouble to say anything to the young man against his cousin; he will\nmake his own comparisons, which--\"\n\n\"Well, he has promised to dine with me the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Ah! if you only _would_, madame--\" said the abbe.\n\n\"What is it that you wish me to do, monsieur l'abbe? Do you mean to\noffer me bad advice? I have not reached the age of thirty-nine, without\na stain upon my reputation, thank God! to compromise myself now, even\nfor the empire of the Great Mogul. You and I are of an age when we both\nknow the meaning of words. For an ecclesiastic, you certainly have ideas\nthat are very incongruous. Fie! it is worthy of Faublas!\"\n\n\"You have read Faublas?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur l'abbe; I meant to say the _Liaisons dangereuses_.\"\n\n\"Ah! that book is infinitely more moral,\" said the abbe, laughing. \"But\nyou make me out as wicked as a young man of the present day; I only\nmeant--\"\n\n\"Do you dare to tell me you were not thinking of putting wicked things\ninto my head? Isn't it perfectly clear? If this young man--who I admit\nis very good-looking--were to make love to me, he would not think of his\ncousin. In Paris, I know, good mothers do devote themselves in this\nway to the happiness and welfare of their children; but we live in the\nprovinces, monsieur l'abbe.\"\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"And,\" she continued, \"I do not want, and Adolphe himself would not\nwant, a hundred millions brought at such a price.\"\n\n\"Madame, I said nothing about a hundred millions; that temptation might\nbe too great for either of us to withstand. Only, I do think that an\nhonest woman may permit herself, in all honor, certain harmless little\ncoquetries, which are, in fact, part of her social duty and which--\"\n\n\"Do you think so?\"\n\n\"Are we not bound, madame, to make ourselves agreeable to each\nother?--Permit me to blow my nose.--I assure you, madame,\" he resumed,\n\"that the young gentleman ogled you through his glass in a more\nflattering manner than he put on when he looked at me; but I forgive him\nfor doing homage to beauty in preference to old age--\"\n\n\"It is quite apparent,\" said the president in his loud voice, \"that\nMonsieur Grandet of Paris has sent his son to Saumur with extremely\nmatrimonial intentions.\"\n\n\"But in that case the cousin wouldn't have fallen among us like a\ncannon-ball,\" answered the notary.\n\n\"That doesn't prove anything,\" said Monsieur des Grassins; \"the old\nmiser is always making mysteries.\"\n\n\"Des Grassins, my friend, I have invited the young man to dinner. You\nmust go and ask Monsieur and Madame de Larsonniere and the du Hautoys,\nwith the beautiful demoiselle du Hautoy, of course. I hope she will be\nproperly dressed; that jealous mother of hers does make such a fright of\nher! Gentlemen, I trust that you will all do us the honor to come,\" she\nadded, stopping the procession to address the two Cruchots.\n\n\"Here you are at home, madame,\" said the notary.\n\nAfter bowing to the three des Grassins, the three Cruchots returned\nhome, applying their provincial genius for analysis to studying, under\nall its aspects, the great event of the evening, which undoubtedly\nchanged the respective positions of Grassinists and Cruchotines. The\nadmirable common-sense which guided all the actions of these great\nmachinators made each side feel the necessity of a momentary alliance\nagainst a common enemy. Must they not mutually hinder Eugenie from\nloving her cousin, and the cousin from thinking of Eugenie? Could the\nParisian resist the influence of treacherous insinuations, soft-spoken\ncalumnies, slanders full of faint praise and artless denials, which\nshould be made to circle incessantly about him and deceive him?\n\n\n\n\nIV\n\nWhen the four relations were left alone, Monsieur Grandet said to his\nnephew,--\n\n\"We must go to bed. It is too late to talk about the matters which have\nbrought you here; to-morrow we will take a suitable moment. We breakfast\nat eight o'clock; at midday we eat a little fruit or a bit of bread, and\ndrink a glass of white wine; and we dine, like the Parisians, at five\no'clock. That's the order of the day. If you like to go and see the\ntown and the environs you are free to do so. You will excuse me if my\noccupations do not permit me to accompany you. You may perhaps hear\npeople say that I am rich,--Monsieur Grandet this, Monsieur Grandet\nthat. I let them talk; their gossip does not hurt my credit. But I have\nnot a penny; I work in my old age like an apprentice whose worldly goods\nare a bad plane and two good arms. Perhaps you'll soon know yourself\nwhat a franc costs when you have got to sweat for it. Nanon, where are\nthe candles?\"\n\n\"I trust, my nephew, that you will find all you want,\" said Madame\nGrandet; \"but if you should need anything else, you can call Nanon.\"\n\n\"My dear aunt, I shall need nothing; I have, I believe, brought\neverything with me. Permit me to bid you good-night, and my young cousin\nalso.\"\n\nCharles took a lighted wax candle from Nanon's hand,--an Anjou candle,\nvery yellow in color, and so shopworn that it looked like tallow and\ndeceived Monsieur Grandet, who, incapable of suspecting its presence\nunder his roof, did not perceive this magnificence.\n\n\"I will show you the way,\" he said.\n\nInstead of leaving the hall by the door which opened under the archway,\nGrandet ceremoniously went through the passage which divided the hall\nfrom the kitchen. A swing-door, furnished with a large oval pane of\nglass, shut this passage from the staircase, so as to fend off the cold\nair which rushed through it. But the north wind whistled none the less\nkeenly in winter, and, in spite of the sand-bags at the bottom of the\ndoors of the living-room, the temperature within could scarcely be kept\nat a proper height. Nanon went to bolt the outer door; then she closed\nthe hall and let loose a wolf-dog, whose bark was so strangled that\nhe seemed to have laryngitis. This animal, noted for his ferocity,\nrecognized no one but Nanon; the two untutored children of the fields\nunderstood each other.\n\nWhen Charles saw the yellow, smoke-stained walls of the well of the\nstaircase, where each worm-eaten step shook under the heavy foot-fall\nof his uncle, his expectations began to sober more and more. He fancied\nhimself in a hen-roost. His aunt and cousin, to whom he turned an\ninquiring look, were so used to the staircase that they did not guess\nthe cause of his amazement, and took the glance for an expression of\nfriendliness, which they answered by a smile that made him desperate.\n\n\"Why the devil did my father send me to such a place?\" he said to\nhimself.\n\nWhen they reached the first landing he saw three doors painted in\nEtruscan red and without casings,--doors sunk in the dusty walls and\nprovided with iron bars, which in fact were bolts, each ending with the\npattern of a flame, as did both ends of the long sheath of the lock.\nThe first door at the top of the staircase, which opened into a room\ndirectly above the kitchen, was evidently walled up. In fact, the only\nentrance to that room was through Grandet's bedchamber; the room itself\nwas his office. The single window which lighted it, on the side of the\ncourt, was protected by a lattice of strong iron bars. No one, not even\nMadame Grandet, had permission to enter it. The old man chose to be\nalone, like an alchemist in his laboratory. There, no doubt, some\nhiding-place had been ingeniously constructed; there the title-deeds of\nproperty were stored; there hung the scales on which to weigh the louis;\nthere were devised, by night and secretly, the estimates, the profits,\nthe receipts, so that business men, finding Grandet prepared at all\npoints, imagined that he got his cue from fairies or demons; there, no\ndoubt, while Nanon's loud snoring shook the rafters, while the wolf-dog\nwatched and yawned in the courtyard, while Madame and Mademoiselle\nGrandet were quietly sleeping, came the old cooper to cuddle, to con\nover, to caress and clutch and clasp his gold. The walls were thick, the\nscreens sure. He alone had the key of this laboratory, where--so people\ndeclared--he studied the maps on which his fruit-trees were marked, and\ncalculated his profits to a vine, and almost to a twig.\n\nThe door of Eugenie's chamber was opposite to the walled-up entrance to\nthis room. At the other end of the landing were the appartements of\nthe married pair, which occupied the whole front of the house. Madame\nGrandet had a room next to that of Eugenie, which was entered through a\nglass door. The master's chamber was separated from that of his wife by\na partition, and from the mysterious strong-room by a thick wall. Pere\nGrandet lodged his nephew on the second floor, in the high mansarde\nattic which was above his own bedroom, so that he might hear him if the\nyoung man took it into his head to go and come. When Eugenie and her\nmother reached the middle of the landing they kissed each other for\ngood-night; then with a few words of adieu to Charles, cold upon the\nlips, but certainly very warm in the heart of the young girl, they\nwithdrew into their own chambers.\n\n\"Here you are in your room, my nephew,\" said Pere Grandet as he opened\nthe door. \"If you need to go out, call Nanon; without her, beware! the\ndog would eat you up without a word. Sleep well. Good-night. Ha! why,\nthey have made you a fire!\" he cried.\n\nAt this moment Nanon appeared with the warming pan.\n\n\"Here's something more!\" said Monsieur Grandet. \"Do you take my nephew\nfor a lying-in woman? Carry off your brazier, Nanon!\"\n\n\"But, monsieur, the sheets are damp, and this gentleman is as delicate\nas a woman.\"\n\n\"Well, go on, as you've taken it into your head,\" said Grandet, pushing\nher by the shoulders; \"but don't set things on fire.\" So saying, the\nmiser went down-stairs, grumbling indistinct sentences.\n\nCharles stood aghast in the midst of his trunks. After casting his\neyes on the attic-walls covered with that yellow paper sprinkled with\nbouquets so well known in dance-houses, on the fireplace of ribbed\nstone whose very look was chilling, on the chairs of yellow wood with\nvarnished cane seats that seemed to have more than the usual four\nangles, on the open night-table capacious enough to hold a small\nsergeant-at-arms, on the meagre bit of rag-carpet beside the bed, on the\ntester whose cloth valance shook as if, devoured by moths, it was about\nto fall, he turned gravely to la Grande Nanon and said,--\n\n\"Look here! my dear woman, just tell me, am I in the house of Monsieur\nGrandet, formerly mayor of Saumur, and brother to Monsieur Grandet of\nParis?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur; and a very good, a very kind, a very perfect gentleman.\nShall I help you to unpack your trunks?\"\n\n\"Faith! yes, if you will, my old trooper. Didn't you serve in the\nmarines of the Imperial Guard?\"\n\n\"Ho, ho, ho!\" laughed Nanon. \"What's that,--the marines of the guard? Is\nit salt? Does it go in the water?\"\n\n\"Here, get me my dressing-gown out of that valise; there's the key.\"\n\nNanon was wonder-struck by the sight of a dressing-gown made of green\nsilk, brocaded with gold flowers of an antique design.\n\n\"Are you going to put that on to go to bed with?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin! what a beautiful altar-cloth it would make for the parish\nchurch! My dear darling monsieur, give it to the church, and you'll save\nyour soul; if you don't, you'll lose it. Oh, how nice you look in it! I\nmust call mademoiselle to see you.\"\n\n\"Come, Nanon, if Nanon you are, hold your tongue; let me go to bed. I'll\narrange my things to-morrow. If my dressing-gown pleases you so much,\nyou shall save your soul. I'm too good a Christian not to give it to you\nwhen I go away, and you can do what you like with it.\"\n\nNanon stood rooted to the ground, gazing at Charles and unable to put\nfaith into his words.\n\n\"Good night, Nanon.\"\n\n\"What in the world have I come here for?\" thought Charles as he went\nto sleep. \"My father is not a fool; my journey must have some object.\nPshaw! put off serious thought till the morrow, as some Greek idiot\nsaid.\"\n\n\"Blessed Virgin! how charming he is, my cousin!\" Eugenie was saying,\ninterrupting her prayers, which that night at least were never finished.\n\nMadame Grandet had no thoughts at all as she went to bed. She heard the\nmiser walking up and down his room through the door of communication\nwhich was in the middle of the partition. Like all timid women, she\nhad studied the character of her lord. Just as the petrel foresees the\nstorm, she knew by imperceptible signs when an inward tempest shook\nher husband; and at such times, to use an expression of her own, she\n\"feigned dead.\"\n\nGrandet gazed at the door lined with sheet-iron which he lately put to\nhis sanctum, and said to himself,--\n\n\"What a crazy idea of my brother to bequeath his son to me! A fine\nlegacy! I have not fifty francs to give him. What are fifty francs to a\ndandy who looked at my barometer as if he meant to make firewood of it!\"\n\nIn thinking over the consequences of that legacy of anguish Grandet was\nperhaps more agitated than his brother had been at the moment of writing\nit.\n\n\"I shall have that golden robe,\" thought Nanon, who went to sleep\ntricked out in her altar-cloth, dreaming for the first time in her life\nof flowers, embroidery, and damask, just as Eugenie was dreaming of\nlove.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nIn the pure and monotonous life of young girls there comes a delicious\nhour when the sun sheds its rays into their soul, when the flowers\nexpress their thoughts, when the throbbings of the heart send upward to\nthe brain their fertilizing warmth and melt all thoughts into a vague\ndesire,--day of innocent melancholy and of dulcet joys! When babes begin\nto see, they smile; when a young girl first perceives the sentiment of\nnature, she smiles as she smiled when an infant. If light is the first\nlove of life, is not love a light to the heart? The moment to see within\nthe veil of earthly things had come for Eugenie.\n\nAn early riser, like all provincial girls, she was up betimes and said\nher prayers, and then began the business of dressing,--a business which\nhenceforth was to have a meaning. First she brushed and smoothed her\nchestnut hair and twisted its heavy masses to the top of her head with\nthe utmost care, preventing the loose tresses from straying, and giving\nto her head a symmetry which heightened the timid candor of her face;\nfor the simplicity of these accessories accorded well with the innocent\nsincerity of its lines. As she washed her hands again and again in\nthe cold water which hardened and reddened the skin, she looked at her\nhandsome round arms and asked herself what her cousin did to make his\nhands so softly white, his nails so delicately curved. She put on\nnew stockings and her prettiest shoes. She laced her corset straight,\nwithout skipping a single eyelet. And then, wishing for the first time\nin her life to appear to advantage, she felt the joy of having a new\ngown, well made, which rendered her attractive.\n\nAs she finished her toilet the clock of the parish church struck the\nhour; to her astonishment, it was only seven. The desire of having\nplenty of time for dressing carefully had led her to get up too early.\nIgnorant of the art of retouching every curl and studying every effect,\nEugenie simply crossed her arms, sat down by the window, and looked\nat the court-yard, the narrow garden, and the high terraced walls that\nover-topped it: a dismal, hedged-in prospect, yet not wholly devoid\nof those mysterious beauties which belong to solitary or uncultivated\nnature. Near the kitchen was a well surrounded by a curb, with a\npulley fastened to a bent iron rod clasped by a vine whose leaves\nwere withered, reddened, and shrivelled by the season. From thence the\ntortuous shoots straggled to the wall, clutched it, and ran the whole\nlength of the house, ending near the wood-pile, where the logs were\nranged with as much precision as the books in a library. The pavement\nof the court-yard showed the black stains produced in time by lichens,\nherbage, and the absence of all movement or friction. The thick walls\nwore a coating of green moss streaked with waving brown lines, and the\neight stone steps at the bottom of the court-yard which led up to the\ngate of the garden were disjointed and hidden beneath tall plants, like\nthe tomb of a knight buried by his widow in the days of the Crusades.\nAbove a foundation of moss-grown, crumbling stones was a trellis of\nrotten wood, half fallen from decay; over them clambered and intertwined\nat will a mass of clustering creepers. On each side of the latticed gate\nstretched the crooked arms of two stunted apple-trees. Three parallel\nwalks, gravelled and separated from each other by square beds, where\nthe earth was held in by box-borders, made the garden, which terminated,\nbeneath a terrace of the old walls, in a group of lindens. At the\nfarther end were raspberry-bushes; at the other, near the house, an\nimmense walnut-tree drooped its branches almost into the window of the\nmiser's sanctum.\n\nA clear day and the beautiful autumnal sun common to the banks of the\nLoire was beginning to melt the hoar-frost which the night had laid on\nthese picturesque objects, on the walls, and on the plants which swathed\nthe court-yard. Eugenie found a novel charm in the aspect of things\nlately so insignificant to her. A thousand confused thoughts came to\nbirth in her mind and grew there, as the sunbeams grew without along the\nwall. She felt that impulse of delight, vague, inexplicable, which wraps\nthe moral being as a cloud wraps the physical body. Her thoughts were\nall in keeping with the details of this strange landscape, and the\nharmonies of her heart blended with the harmonies of nature. When the\nsun reached an angle of the wall where the \"Venus-hair\" of southern\nclimes drooped its thick leaves, lit with the changing colors of a\npigeon's breast, celestial rays of hope illumined the future to her\neyes, and thenceforth she loved to gaze upon that piece of wall, on its\npale flowers, its blue harebells, its wilting herbage, with which she\nmingled memories as tender as those of childhood. The noise made by each\nleaf as it fell from its twig in the void of that echoing court gave\nanswer to the secret questionings of the young girl, who could have\nstayed there the livelong day without perceiving the flight of time.\nThen came tumultuous heavings of the soul. She rose often, went to her\nglass, and looked at herself, as an author in good faith looks at his\nwork to criticise it and blame it in his own mind.\n\n\"I am not beautiful enough for him!\" Such was Eugenie's thought,--a\nhumble thought, fertile in suffering. The poor girl did not do herself\njustice; but modesty, or rather fear, is among the first of love's\nvirtues. Eugenie belonged to the type of children with sturdy\nconstitutions, such as we see among the lesser bourgeoisie, whose\nbeauties always seem a little vulgar; and yet, though she resembled\nthe Venus of Milo, the lines of her figure were ennobled by the softer\nChristian sentiment which purifies womanhood and gives it a distinction\nunknown to the sculptors of antiquity. She had an enormous head, with\nthe masculine yet delicate forehead of the Jupiter of Phidias, and gray\neyes, to which her chaste life, penetrating fully into them, carried a\nflood of light. The features of her round face, formerly fresh and rosy,\nwere at one time swollen by the small-pox, which destroyed the velvet\ntexture of the skin, though it kindly left no other traces, and her\ncheek was still so soft and delicate that her mother's kiss made a\nmomentary red mark upon it. Her nose was somewhat too thick, but it\nharmonized well with the vermilion mouth, whose lips, creased in many\nlines, were full of love and kindness. The throat was exquisitely round.\nThe bust, well curved and carefully covered, attracted the eye and\ninspired reverie. It lacked, no doubt, the grace which a fitting dress\ncan bestow; but to a connoisseur the non-flexibility of her figure\nhad its own charm. Eugenie, tall and strongly made, had none of the\nprettiness which pleases the masses; but she was beautiful with a beauty\nwhich the spirit recognizes, and none but artists truly love. A painter\nseeking here below for a type of Mary's celestial purity, searching\nwomankind for those proud modest eyes which Raphael divined, for those\nvirgin lines, often due to chances of conception, which the modesty of\nChristian life alone can bestow or keep unchanged,--such a painter, in\nlove with his ideal, would have found in the face of Eugenie the innate\nnobleness that is ignorant of itself; he would have seen beneath the\ncalmness of that brow a world of love; he would have felt, in the shape\nof the eyes, in the fall of the eyelids, the presence of the nameless\nsomething that we call divine. Her features, the contour of her head,\nwhich no expression of pleasure had ever altered or wearied, were like\nthe lines of the horizon softly traced in the far distance across the\ntranquil lakes. That calm and rosy countenance, margined with light like\na lovely full-blown flower, rested the mind, held the eye, and imparted\nthe charm of the conscience that was there reflected. Eugenie was\nstanding on the shore of life where young illusions flower, where\ndaisies are gathered with delights ere long to be unknown; and thus she\nsaid, looking at her image in the glass, unconscious as yet of love: \"I\nam too ugly; he will not notice me.\"\n\nThen she opened the door of her chamber which led to the staircase, and\nstretched out her neck to listen for the household noises. \"He is not\nup,\" she thought, hearing Nanon's morning cough as the good soul went\nand came, sweeping out the halls, lighting her fire, chaining the dog,\nand speaking to the beasts in the stable. Eugenie at once went down and\nran to Nanon, who was milking the cow.\n\n\"Nanon, my good Nanon, make a little cream for my cousin's breakfast.\"\n\n\"Why, mademoiselle, you should have thought of that yesterday,\" said\nNanon, bursting into a loud peal of laughter. \"I can't make cream. Your\ncousin is a darling, a darling! oh, that he is! You should have seen\nhim in his dressing-gown, all silk and gold! I saw him, I did! He wears\nlinen as fine as the surplice of monsieur le cure.\"\n\n\"Nanon, please make us a _galette_.\"\n\n\"And who'll give me wood for the oven, and flour and butter for the\ncakes?\" said Nanon, who in her function of prime-minister to Grandet\nassumed at times enormous importance in the eyes of Eugenie and her\nmother. \"Mustn't rob the master to feast the cousin. You ask him for\nbutter and flour and wood: he's your father, perhaps he'll give you\nsome. See! there he is now, coming to give out the provisions.\"\n\nEugenie escaped into the garden, quite frightened as she heard the\nstaircase shaking under her father's step. Already she felt the effects\nof that virgin modesty and that special consciousness of happiness which\nlead us to fancy, not perhaps without reason, that our thoughts are\ngraven on our foreheads and are open to the eyes of all. Perceiving for\nthe first time the cold nakedness of her father's house, the poor\ngirl felt a sort of rage that she could not put it in harmony with her\ncousin's elegance. She felt the need of doing something for him,--what,\nshe did not know. Ingenuous and truthful, she followed her angelic\nnature without mistrusting her impressions or her feelings. The mere\nsight of her cousin had wakened within her the natural yearnings of a\nwoman,--yearnings that were the more likely to develop ardently because,\nhaving reached her twenty-third year, she was in the plenitude of her\nintelligence and her desires. For the first time in her life her heart\nwas full of terror at the sight of her father; in him she saw the master\nof the fate, and she fancied herself guilty of wrong-doing in hiding\nfrom his knowledge certain thoughts. She walked with hasty steps,\nsurprised to breathe a purer air, to feel the sun's rays quickening her\npulses, to absorb from their heat a moral warmth and a new life. As\nshe turned over in her mind some stratagem by which to get the cake, a\nquarrel--an event as rare as the sight of swallows in winter--broke out\nbetween la Grande Nanon and Grandet. Armed with his keys, the master had\ncome to dole out provisions for the day's consumption.\n\n\"Is there any bread left from yesterday?\" he said to Nanon.\n\n\"Not a crumb, monsieur.\"\n\nGrandet took a large round loaf, well floured and moulded in one of the\nflat baskets which they use for baking in Anjou, and was about to cut\nit, when Nanon said to him,--\n\n\"We are five, to-day, monsieur.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said Grandet, \"but your loaves weigh six pounds; there'll\nbe some left. Besides, these young fellows from Paris don't eat bread,\nyou'll see.\"\n\n\"Then they must eat _frippe_?\" said Nanon.\n\n_Frippe_ is a word of the local lexicon of Anjou, and means any\naccompaniment of bread, from butter which is spread upon it, the\ncommonest kind of _frippe_, to peach preserve, the most distinguished of\nall the _frippes_; those who in their childhood have licked the _frippe_\nand left the bread, will comprehend the meaning of Nanon's speech.\n\n\"No,\" answered Grandet, \"they eat neither bread nor _frippe_; they are\nsomething like marriageable girls.\"\n\nAfter ordering the meals for the day with his usual parsimony, the\ngoodman, having locked the closets containing the supplies, was about to\ngo towards the fruit-garden, when Nanon stopped him to say,--\n\n\"Monsieur, give me a little flour and some butter, and I'll make a\n_galette_ for the young ones.\"\n\n\"Are you going to pillage the house on account of my nephew?\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking any more of your nephew than I was of your dog,--not\nmore than you think yourself; for, look here, you've only forked out six\nbits of sugar. I want eight.\"\n\n\"What's all this, Nanon? I have never seen you like this before. What\nhave you got in your head? Are you the mistress here? You sha'n't have\nmore than six pieces of sugar.\"\n\n\"Well, then, how is your nephew to sweeten his coffee?\"\n\n\"With two pieces; I'll go without myself.\"\n\n\"Go without sugar at your age! I'd rather buy you some out of my own\npocket.\"\n\n\"Mind your own business.\"\n\nIn spite of the recent fall in prices, sugar was still in Grandet's eyes\nthe most valuable of all the colonial products; to him it was always\nsix francs a pound. The necessity of economizing it, acquired under the\nEmpire, had grown to be the most inveterate of his habits. All women,\neven the greatest ninnies, know how to dodge and dodge to get their\nends; Nanon abandoned the sugar for the sake of getting the _galette_.\n\n\"Mademoiselle!\" she called through the window, \"do you want some\n_galette_?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" answered Eugenie.\n\n\"Come, Nanon,\" said Grandet, hearing his daughter's voice. \"See here.\"\nHe opened the cupboard where the flour was kept, gave her a cupful, and\nadded a few ounces of butter to the piece he had already cut off.\n\n\"I shall want wood for the oven,\" said the implacable Nanon.\n\n\"Well, take what you want,\" he answered sadly; \"but in that case you\nmust make us a fruit-tart, and you'll cook the whole dinner in the oven.\nIn that way you won't need two fires.\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" cried Nanon, \"you needn't tell me that.\"\n\nGrandet cast a look that was well-nigh paternal upon his faithful\ndeputy.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" she cried, when his back was turned, \"we shall have the\n_galette_.\"\n\nPere Grandet returned from the garden with the fruit and arranged a\nplateful on the kitchen-table.\n\n\"Just see, monsieur,\" said Nanon, \"what pretty boots your nephew has.\nWhat leather! why it smells good! What does he clean it with, I wonder?\nAm I to put your egg-polish on it?\"\n\n\"Nanon, I think eggs would injure that kind of leather. Tell him you\ndon't know how to black morocco; yes, that's morocco. He will get you\nsomething himself in Saumur to polish those boots with. I have heard\nthat they put sugar into the blacking to make it shine.\"\n\n\"They look good to eat,\" said the cook, putting the boots to her nose.\n\"Bless me! if they don't smell like madame's eau-de-cologne. Ah! how\nfunny!\"\n\n\"Funny!\" said her master. \"Do you call it funny to put more money into\nboots than the man who stands in them is worth?\"\n\n\"Monsieur,\" she said, when Grandet returned the second time, after\nlocking the fruit-garden, \"won't you have the _pot-au-feu_ put on once\nor twice a week on account of your nephew?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Am I to go to the butcher's?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. We will make the broth of fowls; the farmers will bring\nthem. I shall tell Cornoiller to shoot some crows; they make the best\nsoup in the world.\"\n\n\"Isn't it true, monsieur, that crows eat the dead?\"\n\n\"You are a fool, Nanon. They eat what they can get, like the rest of the\nworld. Don't we all live on the dead? What are legacies?\"\n\nMonsieur Grandet, having no further orders to give, drew out his watch,\nand seeing that he had half an hour to dispose of before breakfast, he\ntook his hat, went and kissed his daughter, and said to her:\n\n\"Do you want to come for a walk in the fields, down by the Loire? I have\nsomething to do there.\"\n\nEugenie fetched her straw bonnet, lined with pink taffeta; then the\nfather and daughter went down the winding street to the shore.\n\n\"Where are you going at this early hour?\" said Cruchot, the notary,\nmeeting them.\n\n\"To see something,\" answered Grandet, not duped by the matutinal\nappearance of his friend.\n\nWhen Pere Grandet went to \"see something,\" the notary knew by experience\nthere was something to be got by going with him; so he went.\n\n\"Come, Cruchot,\" said Grandet, \"you are one of my friends. I'll show you\nwhat folly it is to plant poplar-trees on good ground.\"\n\n\"Do you call the sixty thousand francs that you pocketed for those that\nwere in your fields down by the Loire, folly?\" said Maitre Cruchot,\nopening his eyes with amazement. \"What luck you have had! To cut down\nyour trees at the very time they ran short of white-wood at Nantes, and\nto sell them at thirty francs!\"\n\nEugenie listened, without knowing that she approached the most solemn\nmoment of her whole life, and that the notary was about to bring down\nupon her head a paternal and supreme sentence. Grandet had now reached\nthe magnificent fields which he owned on the banks of the Loire, where\nthirty workmen were employed in clearing away, filling up, and levelling\nthe spots formerly occupied by the poplars.\n\n\"Maitre Cruchot, see how much ground this tree once took up! Jean,\" he\ncried to a laborer, \"m-m-measure with your r-r-rule, b-both ways.\"\n\n\"Four times eight feet,\" said the man.\n\n\"Thirty-two feet lost,\" said Grandet to Cruchot. \"I had three hundred\npoplars in this one line, isn't that so? Well, then, three h-h-hundred\ntimes thir-thirty-two lost m-m-me five hundred in h-h-hay; add twice as\nmuch for the side rows,--fifteen hundred; the middle rows as much more.\nSo we may c-c-call it a th-thousand b-b-bales of h-h-hay--\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said Cruchot, to help out his friend; \"a thousand bales are\nworth about six hundred francs.\"\n\n\"Say t-t-twelve hundred, be-c-cause there's three or four hundred francs\non the second crop. Well, then, c-c-calculate that t-twelve thousand\nfrancs a year for f-f-forty years with interest c-c-comes to--\"\n\n\"Say sixty thousand francs,\" said the notary.\n\n\"I am willing; c-c-comes t-t-to sixty th-th-thousand. Very good,\"\ncontinued Grandet, without stuttering: \"two thousand poplars forty years\nold will only yield me fifty thousand francs. There's a loss. I have\nfound that myself,\" said Grandet, getting on his high horse. \"Jean, fill\nup all the holes except those at the bank of the river; there you are\nto plant the poplars I have bought. Plant 'em there, and they'll get\nnourishment from the government,\" he said, turning to Cruchot, and\ngiving a slight motion to the wen on his nose, which expressed more than\nthe most ironical of smiles.\n\n\"True enough; poplars should only be planted on poor soil,\" said\nCruchot, amazed at Grandet's calculations.\n\n\"Y-y-yes, monsieur,\" answered the old man satirically.\n\nEugenie, who was gazing at the sublime scenery of the Loire, and paying\nno attention to her father's reckonings, presently turned an ear to the\nremarks of Cruchot when she heard him say,--\n\n\"So you have brought a son-in-law from Paris. All Saumur is talking\nabout your nephew. I shall soon have the marriage-contract to draw up,\nhey! Pere Grandet?\"\n\n\"You g-g-got up very early to t-t-tell me that,\" said Grandet,\naccompanying the remark with a motion of his wen. \"Well, old\nc-c-comrade, I'll be frank, and t-t-tell you what you want t-t-to know.\nI would rather, do you see, f-f-fling my daughter into the Loire than\ng-g-give her to her c-c-cousin. You may t-t-tell that everywhere,--no,\nnever mind; let the world t-t-talk.\"\n\nThis answer dazzled and blinded the young girl with sudden light. The\ndistant hopes upspringing in her heart bloomed suddenly, became real,\ntangible, like a cluster of flowers, and she saw them cut down and\nwilting on the earth. Since the previous evening she had attached\nherself to Charles by those links of happiness which bind soul to soul;\nfrom henceforth suffering was to rivet them. Is it not the noble destiny\nof women to be more moved by the dark solemnities of grief than by the\nsplendors of fortune? How was it that fatherly feeling had died out of\nher father's heart? Of what crime had Charles been guilty? Mysterious\nquestions! Already her dawning love, a mystery so profound, was wrapping\nitself in mystery. She walked back trembling in all her limbs; and when\nshe reached the gloomy street, lately so joyous to her, she felt its\nsadness, she breathed the melancholy which time and events had printed\nthere. None of love's lessons lacked. A few steps from their own door\nshe went on before her father and waited at the threshold. But Grandet,\nwho saw a newspaper in the notary's hand, stopped short and asked,--\n\n\"How are the Funds?\"\n\n\"You never listen to my advice, Grandet,\" answered Cruchot. \"Buy soon;\nyou will still make twenty per cent in two years, besides getting an\nexcellent rate of interest,--five thousand a year for eighty thousand\nfrancs fifty centimes.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" answered Grandet, rubbing his chin.\n\n\"Good God!\" exclaimed the notary.\n\n\"Well, what?\" cried Grandet; and at the same moment Cruchot put the\nnewspaper under his eyes and said:\n\n\"Read that!\"\n\n  \"Monsieur Grandet, one of the most respected merchants in Paris,\n  blew his brains out yesterday, after making his usual appearance\n  at the Bourse. He had sent his resignation to the president of the\n  Chamber of Deputies, and had also resigned his functions as a\n  judge of the commercial courts. The failures of Monsieur Roguin\n  and Monsieur Souchet, his broker and his notary, had ruined him.\n  The esteem felt for Monsieur Grandet and the credit he enjoyed\n  were nevertheless such that he might have obtained the necessary\n  assistance from other business houses. It is much to be regretted\n  that so honorable a man should have yielded to momentary despair,\"\n  etc.\n\n\"I knew it,\" said the old wine-grower to the notary.\n\nThe words sent a chill of horror through Maitre Cruchot, who,\nnotwithstanding his impassibility as a notary, felt the cold running\ndown his spine as he thought that Grandet of Paris had possibly implored\nin vain the millions of Grandet of Saumur.\n\n\"And his son, so joyous yesterday--\"\n\n\"He knows nothing as yet,\" answered Grandet, with the same composure.\n\n\"Adieu! Monsieur Grandet,\" said Cruchot, who now understood the state of\nthe case, and went off to reassure Monsieur de Bonfons.\n\nOn entering, Grandet found breakfast ready. Madame Grandet, round whose\nneck Eugenie had flung her arms, kissing her with the quick effusion of\nfeeling often caused by secret grief, was already seated in her chair on\ncastors, knitting sleeves for the coming winter.\n\n\"You can begin to eat,\" said Nanon, coming downstairs four steps at a\ntime; \"the young one is sleeping like a cherub. Isn't he a darling with\nhis eyes shut? I went in and I called him: no answer.\"\n\n\"Let him sleep,\" said Grandet; \"he'll wake soon enough to hear\nill-tidings.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Eugenie, putting into her coffee the two little bits\nof sugar weighing less than half an ounce which the old miser amused\nhimself by cutting up in his leisure hours. Madame Grandet, who did not\ndare to put the question, gazed at her husband.\n\n\"His father has blown his brains out.\"\n\n\"My uncle?\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"Poor young man!\" exclaimed Madame Grandet.\n\n\"Poor indeed!\" said Grandet; \"he isn't worth a sou!\"\n\n\"Eh! poor boy, and he's sleeping like the king of the world!\" said Nanon\nin a gentle voice.\n\nEugenie stopped eating. Her heart was wrung, as the young heart is wrung\nwhen pity for the suffering of one she loves overflows, for the first\ntime, the whole being of a woman. The poor girl wept.\n\n\"What are you crying about? You didn't know your uncle,\" said her\nfather, giving her one of those hungry tigerish looks he doubtless threw\nupon his piles of gold.\n\n\"But, monsieur,\" said Nanon, \"who wouldn't feel pity for the poor young\nman, sleeping there like a wooden shoe, without knowing what's coming?\"\n\n\"I didn't speak to you, Nanon. Hold your tongue!\"\n\nEugenie learned at that moment that the woman who loves must be able to\nhide her feelings. She did not answer.\n\n\"You will say nothing to him about it, Ma'ame Grandet, till I return,\"\nsaid the old man. \"I have to go and straighten the line of my hedge\nalong the high-road. I shall be back at noon, in time for the second\nbreakfast, and then I will talk with my nephew about his affairs. As\nfor you, Mademoiselle Eugenie, if it is for that dandy you are crying,\nthat's enough, child. He's going off like a shot to the Indies. You will\nnever see him again.\"\n\nThe father took his gloves from the brim of his hat, put them on with\nhis usual composure, pushed them in place by shoving the fingers of both\nhands together, and went out.\n\n\"Mamma, I am suffocating!\" cried Eugenie when she was alone with her\nmother; \"I have never suffered like this.\"\n\nMadame Grandet, seeing that she turned pale, opened the window and let\nher breathe fresh air.\n\n\"I feel better!\" said Eugenie after a moment.\n\nThis nervous excitement in a nature hitherto, to all appearance, calm\nand cold, reacted on Madame Grandet; she looked at her daughter with the\nsympathetic intuition with which mothers are gifted for the objects of\ntheir tenderness, and guessed all. In truth the life of the Hungarian\nsisters, bound together by a freak of nature, could scarcely have been\nmore intimate than that of Eugenie and her mother,--always together\nin the embrasure of that window, and sleeping together in the same\natmosphere.\n\n\"My poor child!\" said Madame Grandet, taking Eugenie's head and laying\nit upon her bosom.\n\nAt these words the young girl raised her head, questioned her mother by\na look, and seemed to search out her inmost thought.\n\n\"Why send him to the Indies?\" she said. \"If he is unhappy, ought he not\nto stay with us? Is he not our nearest relation?\"\n\n\"Yes, my child, it seems natural; but your father has his reasons: we\nmust respect them.\"\n\nThe mother and daughter sat down in silence, the former upon her raised\nseat, the latter in her little armchair, and both took up their work.\nSwelling with gratitude for the full heart-understanding her mother had\ngiven her, Eugenie kissed the dear hand, saying,--\n\n\"How good you are, my kind mamma!\"\n\nThe words sent a glow of light into the motherly face, worn and blighted\nas it was by many sorrows.\n\n\"You like him?\" asked Eugenie.\n\nMadame Grandet only smiled in reply. Then, after a moment's silence, she\nsaid in a low voice: \"Do you love him already? That is wrong.\"\n\n\"Wrong?\" said Eugenie. \"Why is it wrong? You are pleased with him, Nanon\nis pleased with him; why should he not please me? Come, mamma, let us\nset the table for his breakfast.\"\n\nShe threw down her work, and her mother did the same, saying, \"Foolish\nchild!\" But she sanctioned the child's folly by sharing it. Eugenie\ncalled Nanon.\n\n\"What do you want now, mademoiselle?\"\n\n\"Nanon, can we have cream by midday?\"\n\n\"Ah! midday, to be sure you can,\" answered the old servant.\n\n\"Well, let him have his coffee very strong; I heard Monsieur des\nGrassins say that they make the coffee very strong in Paris. Put in a\ngreat deal.\"\n\n\"Where am I to get it?\"\n\n\"Buy some.\"\n\n\"Suppose monsieur meets me?\"\n\n\"He has gone to his fields.\"\n\n\"I'll run, then. But Monsieur Fessard asked me yesterday if the Magi\nhad come to stay with us when I bought the wax candle. All the town will\nknow our goings-on.\"\n\n\"If your father finds it out,\" said Madame Grandet, \"he is capable of\nbeating us.\"\n\n\"Well, let him beat us; we will take his blows on our knees.\"\n\nMadame Grandet for all answer raised her eyes to heaven. Nanon put on\nher hood and went off. Eugenie got out some clean table-linen, and went\nto fetch a few bunches of grapes which she had amused herself by hanging\non a string across the attic; she walked softly along the corridor, so\nas not to waken her cousin, and she could not help listening at the door\nto his quiet breathing.\n\n\"Sorrow is watching while he sleeps,\" she thought.\n\nShe took the freshest vine-leaves and arranged her dish of grapes as\ncoquettishly as a practised house-keeper might have done, and placed it\ntriumphantly on the table. She laid hands on the pears counted out by\nher father, and piled them in a pyramid mixed with leaves. She went\nand came, and skipped and ran. She would have liked to lay under\ncontribution everything in her father's house; but the keys were in his\npocket. Nanon came back with two fresh eggs. At sight of them Eugenie\nalmost hugged her round the neck.\n\n\"The farmer from Lande had them in his basket. I asked him for them, and\nhe gave them to me, the darling, for nothing, as an attention!\"\n\n\n\n\nV\n\nAfter two hours' thought and care, during which Eugenie jumped up twenty\ntimes from her work to see if the coffee were boiling, or to go and\nlisten to the noise her cousin made in dressing, she succeeded in\npreparing a simple little breakfast, very inexpensive, but which,\nnevertheless, departed alarmingly from the inveterate customs of the\nhouse. The midday breakfast was always taken standing. Each took a slice\nof bread, a little fruit or some butter, and a glass of wine. As Eugenie\nlooked at the table drawn up near the fire with an arm-chair placed\nbefore her cousin's plate, at the two dishes of fruit, the egg-cup, the\nbottle of white wine, the bread, and the sugar heaped up in a saucer,\nshe trembled in all her limbs at the mere thought of the look her father\nwould give her if he should come in at that moment. She glanced often\nat the clock to see if her cousin could breakfast before the master's\nreturn.\n\n\"Don't be troubled, Eugenie; if your father comes in, I will take it all\nupon myself,\" said Madame Grandet.\n\nEugenie could not repress a tear.\n\n\"Oh, my good mother!\" she cried, \"I have never loved you enough.\"\n\nCharles, who had been tramping about his room for some time, singing to\nhimself, now came down. Happily, it was only eleven o'clock. The true\nParisian! he had put as much dandyism into his dress as if he were in\nthe chateau of the noble lady then travelling in Scotland. He came into\nthe room with the smiling, courteous manner so becoming to youth,\nwhich made Eugenie's heart beat with mournful joy. He had taken the\ndestruction of his castles in Anjou as a joke, and came up to his aunt\ngaily.\n\n\"Have you slept well, dear aunt? and you, too, my cousin?\"\n\n\"Very well, monsieur; did you?\" said Madame Grandet.\n\n\"I? perfectly.\"\n\n\"You must be hungry, cousin,\" said Eugenie; \"will you take your seat?\"\n\n\"I never breakfast before midday; I never get up till then. However, I\nfared so badly on the journey that I am glad to eat something at once.\nBesides--\" here he pulled out the prettiest watch Breguet ever made.\n\"Dear me! I am early, it is only eleven o'clock!\"\n\n\"Early?\" said Madame Grandet.\n\n\"Yes; but I wanted to put my things in order. Well, I shall be glad to\nhave anything to eat,--anything, it doesn't matter what, a chicken, a\npartridge.\"\n\n\"Holy Virgin!\" exclaimed Nanon, overhearing the words.\n\n\"A partridge!\" whispered Eugenie to herself; she would gladly have given\nthe whole of her little hoard for a partridge.\n\n\"Come and sit down,\" said his aunt.\n\nThe young dandy let himself drop into an easy-chair, just as a pretty\nwoman falls gracefully upon a sofa. Eugenie and her mother took ordinary\nchairs and sat beside him, near the fire.\n\n\"Do you always live here?\" said Charles, thinking the room uglier by\ndaylight than it had seemed the night before.\n\n\"Always,\" answered Eugenie, looking at him, \"except during the vintage.\nThen we go and help Nanon, and live at the Abbaye des Noyers.\"\n\n\"Don't you ever take walks?\"\n\n\"Sometimes on Sunday after vespers, when the weather is fine,\"\nsaid Madame Grandet, \"we walk on the bridge, or we go and watch the\nhaymakers.\"\n\n\"Have you a theatre?\"\n\n\"Go to the theatre!\" exclaimed Madame Grandet, \"see a play! Why,\nmonsieur, don't you know it is a mortal sin?\"\n\n\"See here, monsieur,\" said Nanon, bringing in the eggs, \"here are your\nchickens,--in the shell.\"\n\n\"Oh! fresh eggs,\" said Charles, who, like all people accustomed to\nluxury, had already forgotten about his partridge, \"that is delicious:\nnow, if you will give me the butter, my good girl.\"\n\n\"Butter! then you can't have the _galette_.\"\n\n\"Nanon, bring the butter,\" cried Eugenie.\n\nThe young girl watched her cousin as he cut his sippets, with as much\npleasure as a grisette takes in a melodrama where innocence and virtue\ntriumph. Charles, brought up by a charming mother, improved, and trained\nby a woman of fashion, had the elegant, dainty, foppish movements of\na coxcomb. The compassionate sympathy and tenderness of a young girl\npossess a power that is actually magnetic; so that Charles, finding\nhimself the object of the attentions of his aunt and cousin, could not\nescape the influence of feelings which flowed towards him, as it were,\nand inundated him. He gave Eugenie a bright, caressing look full of\nkindness,--a look which seemed itself a smile. He perceived, as his eyes\nlingered upon her, the exquisite harmony of features in the pure face,\nthe grace of her innocent attitude, the magic clearness of the eyes,\nwhere young love sparkled and desire shone unconsciously.\n\n\"Ah! my dear cousin, if you were in full dress at the Opera, I assure\nyou my aunt's words would come true,--you would make the men commit the\nmortal sin of envy, and the women the sin of jealousy.\"\n\nThe compliment went to Eugenie's heart and set it beating, though she\ndid not understand its meaning.\n\n\"Oh! cousin,\" she said, \"you are laughing at a poor little country\ngirl.\"\n\n\"If you knew me, my cousin, you would know that I abhor ridicule; it\nwithers the heart and jars upon all my feelings.\" Here he swallowed his\nbuttered sippet very gracefully. \"No, I really have not enough mind to\nmake fun of others; and doubtless it is a great defect. In Paris, when\nthey want to disparage a man, they say: 'He has a good heart.' The\nphrase means: 'The poor fellow is as stupid as a rhinoceros.' But as I\nam rich, and known to hit the bull's-eye at thirty paces with any kind\nof pistol, and even in the open fields, ridicule respects me.\"\n\n\"My dear nephew, that bespeaks a good heart.\"\n\n\"You have a very pretty ring,\" said Eugenie; \"is there any harm in\nasking to see it?\"\n\nCharles held out his hand after loosening the ring, and Eugenie blushed\nas she touched the pink nails of her cousin with the tips of her\nfingers.\n\n\"See, mamma, what beautiful workmanship.\"\n\n\"My! there's a lot of gold!\" said Nanon, bringing in the coffee.\n\n\"What is that?\" exclaimed Charles, laughing, as he pointed to an oblong\npot of brown earthenware, glazed on the inside, and edged with a fringe\nof ashes, from the bottom of which the coffee-grounds were bubbling up\nand falling in the boiling liquid.\n\n\"It is boiled coffee,\" said Nanon.\n\n\"Ah! my dear aunt, I shall at least leave one beneficent trace of my\nvisit here. You are indeed behind the age! I must teach you to make good\ncoffee in a Chaptal coffee-pot.\"\n\nHe tried to explain the process of a Chaptal coffee-pot.\n\n\"Gracious! if there are so many things as all that to do,\" said Nanon,\n\"we may as well give up our lives to it. I shall never make coffee that\nway; I know that! Pray, who is to get the fodder for the cow while I\nmake the coffee?\"\n\n\"I will make it,\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"Child!\" said Madame Grandet, looking at her daughter.\n\nThe word recalled to their minds the sorrow that was about to fall upon\nthe unfortunate young man; the three women were silent, and looked at\nhim with an air of commiseration that caught his attention.\n\n\"Is anything the matter, my cousin?\" he said.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Madame Grandet to Eugenie, who was about to answer;\n\"you know, my daughter, that your father charged us not to speak to\nmonsieur--\"\n\n\"Say Charles,\" said young Grandet.\n\n\"Ah! you are called Charles? What a beautiful name!\" cried Eugenie.\n\nPresentiments of evil are almost always justified. At this moment Nanon,\nMadame Grandet, and Eugenie, who had all three been thinking with a\nshudder of the old man's return, heard the knock whose echoes they knew\nbut too well.\n\n\"There's papa!\" said Eugenie.\n\nShe removed the saucer filled with sugar, leaving a few pieces on the\ntable-cloth; Nanon carried off the egg-cup; Madame Grandet sat up like a\nfrightened hare. It was evidently a panic, which amazed Charles, who was\nwholly unable to understand it.\n\n\"Why! what is the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"My father has come,\" answered Eugenie.\n\n\"Well, what of that?\"\n\nMonsieur Grandet entered the room, threw his keen eye upon the table,\nupon Charles, and saw the whole thing.\n\n\"Ha! ha! so you have been making a feast for your nephew; very good,\nvery good, very good indeed!\" he said, without stuttering. \"When the\ncat's away, the mice will play.\"\n\n\"Feast!\" thought Charles, incapable of suspecting or imagining the rules\nand customs of the household.\n\n\"Give me my glass, Nanon,\" said the master\n\nEugenie brought the glass. Grandet drew a horn-handled knife with a big\nblade from his breeches' pocket, cut a slice of bread, took a small bit\nof butter, spread it carefully on the bread, and ate it standing. At\nthis moment Charlie was sweetening his coffee. Pere Grandet saw the\nbits of sugar, looked at his wife, who turned pale, and made three steps\nforward; he leaned down to the poor woman's ear and said,--\n\n\"Where did you get all that sugar?\"\n\n\"Nanon fetched it from Fessard's; there was none.\"\n\nIt is impossible to picture the profound interest the three women took\nin this mute scene. Nanon had left her kitchen and stood looking into\nthe room to see what would happen. Charles, having tasted his coffee,\nfound it bitter and glanced about for the sugar, which Grandet had\nalready put away.\n\n\"What do you want?\" said his uncle.\n\n\"The sugar.\"\n\n\"Put in more milk,\" answered the master of the house; \"your coffee will\ntaste sweeter.\"\n\nEugenie took the saucer which Grandet had put away and placed it on the\ntable, looking calmly at her father as she did so. Most assuredly,\nthe Parisian woman who held a silken ladder with her feeble arms to\nfacilitate the flight of her lover, showed no greater courage than\nEugenie displayed when she replaced the sugar upon the table. The lover\nrewarded his mistress when she proudly showed him her beautiful bruised\narm, and bathed every swollen vein with tears and kisses till it was\ncured with happiness. Charles, on the other hand, never so much as knew\nthe secret of the cruel agitation that shook and bruised the heart of\nhis cousin, crushed as it was by the look of the old miser.\n\n\"You are not eating your breakfast, wife.\"\n\nThe poor helot came forward with a piteous look, cut herself a piece of\nbread, and took a pear. Eugenie boldly offered her father some grapes,\nsaying,--\n\n\"Taste my preserves, papa. My cousin, you will eat some, will you not? I\nwent to get these pretty grapes expressly for you.\"\n\n\"If no one stops them, they will pillage Saumur for you, nephew. When\nyou have finished, we will go into the garden; I have something to tell\nyou which can't be sweetened.\"\n\nEugenie and her mother cast a look on Charles whose meaning the young\nman could not mistake.\n\n\"What is it you mean, uncle? Since the death of my poor mother\"--at\nthese words his voice softened--\"no other sorrow can touch me.\"\n\n\"My nephew, who knows by what afflictions God is pleased to try us?\"\nsaid his aunt.\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta,\" said Grandet, \"there's your nonsense beginning. I\nam sorry to see those white hands of yours, nephew\"; and he showed the\nshoulder-of-mutton fists which Nature had put at the end of his own\narms. \"There's a pair of hands made to pick up silver pieces. You've\nbeen brought up to put your feet in the kid out of which we make the\npurses we keep our money in. A bad look-out! Very bad!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, uncle? I'll be hanged if I understand a single word\nof what you are saying.\"\n\n\"Come!\" said Grandet.\n\nThe miser closed the blade of his knife with a snap, drank the last of\nhis wine, and opened the door.\n\n\"My cousin, take courage!\"\n\nThe tone of the young girl struck terror to Charles's heart, and he\nfollowed his terrible uncle, a prey to disquieting thoughts. Eugenie,\nher mother, and Nanon went into the kitchen, moved by irresistible\ncuriosity to watch the two actors in the scene which was about to take\nplace in the garden, where at first the uncle walked silently ahead of\nthe nephew. Grandet was not at all troubled at having to tell Charles of\nthe death of his father; but he did feel a sort of compassion in knowing\nhim to be without a penny, and he sought for some phrase or formula by\nwhich to soften the communication of that cruel truth. \"You have lost\nyour father,\" seemed to him a mere nothing to say; fathers die before\ntheir children. But \"you are absolutely without means,\"--all the\nmisfortunes of life were summed up in those words! Grandet walked round\nthe garden three times, the gravel crunching under his heavy step.\n\nIn the crucial moments of life our minds fasten upon the locality where\njoys or sorrows overwhelm us. Charles noticed with minute attention the\nbox-borders of the little garden, the yellow leaves as they fluttered\ndown, the dilapidated walls, the gnarled fruit-trees,--picturesque\ndetails which were destined to remain forever in his memory, blending\neternally, by the mnemonics that belong exclusively to the passions,\nwith the recollections of this solemn hour.\n\n\"It is very fine weather, very warm,\" said Grandet, drawing a long\nbreath.\n\n\"Yes, uncle; but why--\"\n\n\"Well, my lad,\" answered his uncle, \"I have some bad news to give you.\nYour father is ill--\"\n\n\"Then why am I here?\" said Charles. \"Nanon,\" he cried, \"order\npost-horses! I can get a carriage somewhere?\" he added, turning to his\nuncle, who stood motionless.\n\n\"Horses and carriages are useless,\" answered Grandet, looking at\nCharles, who remained silent, his eyes growing fixed. \"Yes, my poor boy,\nyou guess the truth,--he is dead. But that's nothing; there is something\nworse: he blew out his brains.\"\n\n\"My father!\"\n\n\"Yes, but that's not the worst; the newspapers are all talking about it.\nHere, read that.\"\n\nGrandet, who had borrowed the fatal article from Cruchot, thrust the\npaper under his nephew's eyes. The poor young man, still a child, still\nat an age when feelings wear no mask, burst into tears.\n\n\"That's good!\" thought Grandet; \"his eyes frightened me. He'll be all\nright if he weeps,--That is not the worst, my poor nephew,\" he said\naloud, not noticing whether Charles heard him, \"that is nothing; you\nwill get over it: but--\"\n\n\"Never, never! My father! Oh, my father!\"\n\n\"He has ruined you, you haven't a penny.\"\n\n\"What does that matter? My father! Where is my father?\"\n\nHis sobs resounded horribly against those dreary walls and reverberated\nin the echoes. The three women, filled with pity, wept also; for tears\nare often as contagious as laughter. Charles, without listening further\nto his uncle, ran through the court and up the staircase to his chamber,\nwhere he threw himself across the bed and hid his face in the sheets, to\nweep in peace for his lost parents.\n\n\"The first burst must have its way,\" said Grandet, entering the\nliving-room, where Eugenie and her mother had hastily resumed their\nseats and were sewing with trembling hands, after wiping their eyes.\n\"But that young man is good for nothing; his head is more taken up with\nthe dead than with his money.\"\n\nEugenie shuddered as she heard her father's comment on the most sacred\nof all griefs. From that moment she began to judge him. Charles's sobs,\nthough muffled, still sounded through the sepulchral house; and his deep\ngroans, which seemed to come from the earth beneath, only ceased towards\nevening, after growing gradually feebler.\n\n\"Poor young man!\" said Madame Grandet.\n\nFatal exclamation! Pere Grandet looked at his wife, at Eugenie, and at\nthe sugar-bowl. He recollected the extraordinary breakfast prepared for\nthe unfortunate youth, and he took a position in the middle of the room.\n\n\"Listen to me,\" he said, with his usual composure. \"I hope that you\nwill not continue this extravagance, Madame Grandet. I don't give you MY\nmoney to stuff that young fellow with sugar.\"\n\n\"My mother had nothing to do with it,\" said Eugenie; \"it was I who--\"\n\n\"Is it because you are of age,\" said Grandet, interrupting his daughter,\n\"that you choose to contradict me? Remember, Eugenie--\"\n\n\"Father, the son of your brother ought to receive from us--\"\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta!\" exclaimed the cooper on four chromatic tones; \"the son\nof my brother this, my nephew that! Charles is nothing at all to us; he\nhasn't a farthing, his father has failed; and when this dandy has cried\nhis fill, off he goes from here. I won't have him revolutionize my\nhousehold.\"\n\n\"What is 'failing,' father?\" asked Eugenie.\n\n\"To fail,\" answered her father, \"is to commit the most dishonorable\naction that can disgrace a man.\"\n\n\"It must be a great sin,\" said Madame Grandet, \"and our brother may be\ndamned.\"\n\n\"There, there, don't begin with your litanies!\" said Grandet, shrugging\nhis shoulders. \"To fail, Eugenie,\" he resumed, \"is to commit a theft\nwhich the law, unfortunately, takes under its protection. People have\ngiven their property to Guillaume Grandet trusting to his reputation for\nhonor and integrity; he has made away with it all, and left them nothing\nbut their eyes to weep with. A highway robber is better than a bankrupt:\nthe one attacks you and you can defend yourself, he risks his own life;\nbut the other--in short, Charles is dishonored.\"\n\nThe words rang in the poor girl's heart and weighed it down with their\nheavy meaning. Upright and delicate as a flower born in the depths of\na forest, she knew nothing of the world's maxims, of its deceitful\narguments and specious sophisms; she therefore believed the atrocious\nexplanation which her father gave her designedly, concealing the\ndistinction which exists between an involuntary failure and an\nintentional one.\n\n\"Father, could you not have prevented such a misfortune?\"\n\n\"My brother did not consult me. Besides, he owes four millions.\"\n\n\"What is a 'million,' father?\" she asked, with the simplicity of a child\nwhich thinks it can find out at once all that it wants to know.\n\n\"A million?\" said Grandet, \"why, it is a million pieces of twenty sous\neach, and it takes five twenty sous pieces to make five francs.\"\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried Eugenie, \"how could my uncle possibly have had\nfour millions? Is there any one else in France who ever had so many\nmillions?\" Pere Grandet stroked his chin, smiled, and his wen seemed to\ndilate. \"But what will become of my cousin Charles?\"\n\n\"He is going off to the West Indies by his father's request, and he will\ntry to make his fortune there.\"\n\n\"Has he got the money to go with?\"\n\n\"I shall pay for his journey as far as--yes, as far as Nantes.\"\n\nEugenie sprang into his arms.\n\n\"Oh, father, how good you are!\"\n\nShe kissed him with a warmth that almost made Grandet ashamed of\nhimself, for his conscience galled him a little.\n\n\"Will it take much time to amass a million?\" she asked.\n\n\"Look here!\" said the old miser, \"you know what a napoleon is? Well, it\ntakes fifty thousand napoleons to make a million.\"\n\n\"Mamma, we must say a great many _neuvaines_ for him.\"\n\n\"I was thinking so,\" said Madame Grandet.\n\n\"That's the way, always spending my money!\" cried the father. \"Do you\nthink there are francs on every bush?\"\n\nAt this moment a muffled cry, more distressing than all the others,\nechoed through the garrets and struck a chill to the hearts of Eugenie\nand her mother.\n\n\"Nanon, go upstairs and see that he does not kill himself,\" said\nGrandet. \"Now, then,\" he added, looking at his wife and daughter, who\nhad turned pale at his words, \"no nonsense, you two! I must leave you; I\nhave got to see about the Dutchmen who are going away to-day. And then I\nmust find Cruchot, and talk with him about all this.\"\n\nHe departed. As soon as he had shut the door Eugenie and her mother\nbreathed more freely. Until this morning the young girl had never felt\nconstrained in the presence of her father; but for the last few hours\nevery moment wrought a change in her feelings and ideas.\n\n\"Mamma, how many louis are there in a cask of wine?\"\n\n\"Your father sells his from a hundred to a hundred and fifty francs,\nsometimes two hundred,--at least, so I've heard say.\"\n\n\"Then papa must be rich?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is. But Monsieur Cruchot told me he bought Froidfond two\nyears ago; that may have pinched him.\"\n\nEugenie, not being able to understand the question of her father's\nfortune, stopped short in her calculations.\n\n\"He didn't even see me, the darling!\" said Nanon, coming back from her\nerrand. \"He's stretched out like a calf on his bed and crying like the\nMadeleine, and that's a blessing! What's the matter with the poor dear\nyoung man!\"\n\n\"Let us go and console him, mamma; if any one knocks, we can come down.\"\n\nMadame Grandet was helpless against the sweet persuasive tones of her\ndaughter's voice. Eugenie was sublime: she had become a woman. The two,\nwith beating hearts, went up to Charles's room. The door was open.\nThe young man heard and saw nothing; plunged in grief, he only uttered\ninarticulate cries.\n\n\"How he loves his father!\" said Eugenie in a low voice.\n\nIn the utterance of those words it was impossible to mistake the hopes\nof a heart that, unknown to itself, had suddenly become passionate.\nMadame Grandet cast a mother's look upon her daughter, and then\nwhispered in her ear,--\n\n\"Take care, you will love him!\"\n\n\"Love him!\" answered Eugenie. \"Ah! if you did but know what my father\nsaid to Monsieur Cruchot.\"\n\nCharles turned over, and saw his aunt and cousin.\n\n\"I have lost my father, my poor father! If he had told me his secret\ntroubles we might have worked together to repair them. My God! my poor\nfather! I was so sure I should see him again that I think I kissed him\nquite coldly--\"\n\nSobs cut short the words.\n\n\"We will pray for him,\" said Madame Grandet. \"Resign yourself to the\nwill of God.\"\n\n\"Cousin,\" said Eugenie, \"take courage! Your loss is irreparable;\ntherefore think only of saving your honor.\"\n\nWith the delicate instinct of a woman who intuitively puts her mind\ninto all things, even at the moment when she offers consolation, Eugenie\nsought to cheat her cousin's grief by turning his thoughts inward upon\nhimself.\n\n\"My honor?\" exclaimed the young man, tossing aside his hair with an\nimpatient gesture as he sat up on his bed and crossed his arms.\n\"Ah! that is true. My uncle said my father had failed.\" He uttered a\nheart-rending cry, and hid his face in his hands. \"Leave me, leave me,\ncousin! My God! my God! forgive my father, for he must have suffered\nsorely!\"\n\nThere was something terribly attractive in the sight of this young\nsorrow, sincere without reasoning or afterthought. It was a virgin\ngrief which the simple hearts of Eugenie and her mother were fitted to\ncomprehend, and they obeyed the sign Charles made them to leave him\nto himself. They went downstairs in silence and took their accustomed\nplaces by the window and sewed for nearly an hour without exchanging\na word. Eugenie had seen in the furtive glance that she cast about the\nyoung man's room--that girlish glance which sees all in the twinkling\nof an eye--the pretty trifles of his dressing-case, his scissors, his\nrazors embossed with gold. This gleam of luxury across her cousin's\ngrief only made him the more interesting to her, possibly by way of\ncontrast. Never before had so serious an event, so dramatic a sight,\ntouched the imaginations of these two passive beings, hitherto sunk in\nthe stillness and calm of solitude.\n\n\"Mamma,\" said Eugenie, \"we must wear mourning for my uncle.\"\n\n\"Your father will decide that,\" answered Madame Grandet.\n\nThey relapsed into silence. Eugenie drew her stitches with a uniform\nmotion which revealed to an observer the teeming thoughts of her\nmeditation. The first desire of the girl's heart was to share her\ncousin's mourning.\n\n\n\n\nVI\n\nAbout four o'clock an abrupt knock at the door struck sharply on the\nheart of Madame Grandet.\n\n\"What can have happened to your father?\" she said to her daughter.\n\nGrandet entered joyously. After taking off his gloves, he rubbed his\nhands hard enough to take off their skin as well, if his epidermis had\nnot been tanned and cured like Russia leather,--saving, of course, the\nperfume of larch-trees and incense. Presently his secret escaped him.\n\n\"Wife,\" he said, without stuttering, \"I've trapped them all! Our wine\nis sold! The Dutch and the Belgians have gone. I walked about the\nmarket-place in front of their inn, pretending to be doing nothing. That\nBelgian fellow--you know who I mean--came up to me. The owners of all\nthe good vineyards have kept back their vintages, intending to wait;\nwell, I didn't hinder them. The Belgian was in despair; I saw that. In\na minute the bargain was made. He takes my vintage at two hundred francs\nthe puncheon, half down. He paid me in gold; the notes are drawn. Here\nare six louis for you. In three months wines will have fallen.\"\n\nThese words, uttered in a quiet tone of voice, were nevertheless so\nbitterly sarcastic that the inhabitants of Saumur, grouped at this\nmoment in the market-place and overwhelmed by the news of the sale\nGrandet had just effected, would have shuddered had they heard them.\nTheir panic would have brought the price of wines down fifty per cent at\nonce.\n\n\"Did you have a thousand puncheons this year, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, little one.\"\n\nThat term applied to his daughter was the superlative expression of the\nold miser's joy.\n\n\"Then that makes two hundred thousand pieces of twenty sous each?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mademoiselle Grandet.\"\n\n\"Then, father, you can easily help Charles.\"\n\nThe amazement, the anger, the stupefaction of Belshazzar when he saw\nthe _Mene-Tekel-Upharsin_ before his eyes is not to be compared with the\ncold rage of Grandet, who, having forgotten his nephew, now found him\nenshrined in the heart and calculations of his daughter.\n\n\"What's this? Ever since that dandy put foot in _my_ house everything\ngoes wrong! You behave as if you had the right to buy sugar-plums and\nmake feasts and weddings. I won't have that sort of thing. I hope I know\nmy duty at my time of life! I certainly sha'n't take lessons from my\ndaughter, or from anybody else. I shall do for my nephew what it is\nproper to do, and you have no need to poke your nose into it. As for\nyou, Eugenie,\" he added, facing her, \"don't speak of this again, or I'll\nsend you to the Abbaye des Noyers with Nanon, see if I don't; and no\nlater than to-morrow either, if you disobey me! Where is that fellow,\nhas he come down yet?\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" answered Madame Grandet.\n\n\"What is he doing then?\"\n\n\"He is weeping for his father,\" said Eugenie.\n\nGrandet looked at his daughter without finding a word to say; after all,\nhe was a father. He made a couple of turns up and down the room, and\nthen went hurriedly to his secret den to think over an investment he\nwas meditating in the public Funds. The thinning out of his two thousand\nacres of forest land had yielded him six hundred thousand francs:\nputting this sum to that derived from the sale of his poplars and to his\nother gains for the last year and for the current year, he had amassed a\ntotal of nine hundred thousand francs, without counting the two hundred\nthousand he had got by the sale just concluded. The twenty per cent\nwhich Cruchot assured him would gain in a short time from the Funds,\nthen quoted at seventy, tempted him. He figured out his calculation\non the margin of the newspaper which gave the account of his brother's\ndeath, all the while hearing the moans of his nephew, but without\nlistening to them. Nanon came and knocked on the wall to summon him to\ndinner. On the last step of the staircase he was saying to himself as he\ncame down,--\n\n\"I'll do it; I shall get eight per cent interest. In two years I shall\nhave fifteen hundred thousand francs, which I will then draw out in good\ngold,--Well, where's my nephew?\"\n\n\"He says he doesn't want anything to eat,\" answered Nanon; \"that's not\ngood for him.\"\n\n\"So much saved,\" retorted her master.\n\n\"That's so,\" she said.\n\n\"Bah! he won't cry long. Hunger drives the wolves out of the woods.\"\n\nThe dinner was eaten in silence.\n\n\"My good friend,\" said Madame Grandet, when the cloth was removed, \"we\nmust put on mourning.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Madame Grandet! what will you invent next to spend money\non? Mourning is in the heart, and not in the clothes.\"\n\n\"But mourning for a brother is indispensable; and the Church commands us\nto--\"\n\n\"Buy your mourning out of your six louis. Give me a hat-band; that's\nenough for me.\"\n\nEugenie raised her eyes to heaven without uttering a word. Her generous\ninstincts, slumbering and long repressed but now suddenly and for the\nfirst time awakened, were galled at every turn. The evening passed to\nall appearance like a thousand other evenings of their monotonous life,\nyet it was certainly the most horrible. Eugenie sewed without raising\nher head, and did not use the workbox which Charles had despised the\nnight before. Madame Grandet knitted her sleeves. Grandet twirled his\nthumbs for four hours, absorbed in calculations whose results were on\nthe morrow to astonish Saumur. No one came to visit the family that\nday. The whole town was ringing with the news of the business trick just\nplayed by Grandet, the failure of his brother, and the arrival of his\nnephew. Obeying the desire to gossip over their mutual interests, all\nthe upper and middle-class wine-growers in Saumur met at Monsieur des\nGrassins, where terrible imprecations were being fulminated against the\nex-mayor. Nanon was spinning, and the whirr of her wheel was the only\nsound heard beneath the gray rafters of that silent hall.\n\n\"We don't waste our tongues,\" she said, showing her teeth, as large and\nwhite as peeled almonds.\n\n\"Nothing should be wasted,\" answered Grandet, rousing himself from his\nreverie. He saw a perspective of eight millions in three years, and he\nwas sailing along that sheet of gold. \"Let us go to bed. I will bid\nmy nephew good-night for the rest of you, and see if he will take\nanything.\"\n\nMadame Grandet remained on the landing of the first storey to hear the\nconversation that was about to take place between the goodman and his\nnephew. Eugenie, bolder than her mother, went up two stairs.\n\n\"Well, nephew, you are in trouble. Yes, weep, that's natural. A father\nis a father; but we must bear our troubles patiently. I am a good uncle\nto you, remember that. Come, take courage! Will you have a little glass\nof wine?\" (Wine costs nothing in Saumur, and they offer it as tea is\noffered in China.) \"Why!\" added Grandet, \"you have got no light! That's\nbad, very bad; you ought to see what you are about,\" and he walked to\nthe chimney-piece. \"What's this?\" he cried. \"A wax candle! How the\ndevil did they filch a wax candle? The spendthrifts would tear down the\nceilings of my house to boil the fellow's eggs.\"\n\nHearing these words, mother and daughter slipped back into their rooms\nand burrowed in their beds, with the celerity of frightened mice getting\nback to their holes.\n\n\"Madame Grandet, have you found a mine?\" said the man, coming into the\nchamber of his wife.\n\n\"My friend, wait; I am saying my prayers,\" said the poor mother in a\ntrembling voice.\n\n\"The devil take your good God!\" growled Grandet in reply.\n\nMisers have no belief in a future life; the present is their all in all.\nThis thought casts a terrible light upon our present epoch, in which,\nfar more than at any former period, money sways the laws and politics\nand morals. Institutions, books, men, and dogmas, all conspire to\nundermine belief in a future life,--a belief upon which the social\nedifice has rested for eighteen hundred years. The grave, as a means of\ntransition, is little feared in our day. The future, which once opened\nto us beyond the requiems, has now been imported into the present. To\nobtain _per fas et nefas_ a terrestrial paradise of luxury and earthly\nenjoyment, to harden the heart and macerate the body for the sake of\nfleeting possessions, as the martyrs once suffered all things to reach\neternal joys, this is now the universal thought--a thought written\neverywhere, even in the very laws which ask of the legislator, \"What do\nyou pay?\" instead of asking him, \"What do you think?\" When this doctrine\nhas passed down from the bourgeoisie to the populace, where will this\ncountry be?\n\n\"Madame Grandet, have you done?\" asked the old man.\n\n\"My friend, I am praying for you.\"\n\n\"Very good! Good-night; to-morrow morning we will have a talk.\"\n\nThe poor woman went to sleep like a schoolboy who, not having learned\nhis lessons, knows he will see his master's angry face on the morrow. At\nthe moment when, filled with fear, she was drawing the sheet above her\nhead that she might stifle hearing, Eugenie, in her night-gown and with\nnaked feet, ran to her side and kissed her brow.\n\n\"Oh! my good mother,\" she said, \"to-morrow I will tell him it was I.\"\n\n\"No; he would send you to Noyers. Leave me to manage it; he cannot eat\nme.\"\n\n\"Do you hear, mamma?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"_He_ is weeping still.\"\n\n\"Go to bed, my daughter; you will take cold in your feet: the floor is\ndamp.\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nThus passed the solemn day which was destined to weight upon the whole\nlife of the rich and poor heiress, whose sleep was never again to be\nso calm, nor yet so pure, as it had been up to this moment. It often\nhappens that certain actions of human life seem, literally speaking,\nimprobable, though actual. Is not this because we constantly omit\nto turn the stream of psychological light upon our impulsive\ndeterminations, and fail to explain the subtile reasons, mysteriously\nconceived in our minds, which impelled them? Perhaps Eugenie's deep\npassion should be analyzed in its most delicate fibres; for it became,\nscoffers might say, a malady which influenced her whole existence. Many\npeople prefer to deny results rather than estimate the force of ties and\nlinks and bonds, which secretly join one fact to another in the moral\norder. Here, therefore, Eugenie's past life will offer to observers\nof human nature an explanation of her naive want of reflection and the\nsuddenness of the emotions which overflowed her soul. The more tranquil\nher life had been, the more vivid was her womanly pity, the more\nsimple-minded were the sentiments now developed in her soul.\n\nMade restless by the events of the day, she woke at intervals to listen\nto her cousin, thinking she heard the sighs which still echoed in her\nheart. Sometimes she saw him dying of his trouble, sometimes she dreamed\nthat he fainted from hunger. Towards morning she was certain that she\nheard a startling cry. She dressed at once and ran, in the dawning\nlight, with a swift foot to her cousin's chamber, the door of which\nhe had left open. The candle had burned down to the socket. Charles,\novercome by nature, was sleeping, dressed and sitting in an armchair\nbeside the bed, on which his head rested; he dreamed as men dream on\nan empty stomach. Eugenie might weep at her ease; she might admire\nthe young and handsome face blotted with grief, the eyes swollen with\nweeping, that seemed, sleeping as they were, to well forth tears.\nCharles felt sympathetically the young girl's presence; he opened his\neyes and saw her pitying him.\n\n\"Pardon me, my cousin,\" he said, evidently not knowing the hour nor the\nplace in which he found himself.\n\n\"There are hearts who hear you, cousin, and _we_ thought you might need\nsomething. You should go to bed; you tire yourself by sitting thus.\"\n\n\"That is true.\"\n\n\"Well, then, adieu!\"\n\nShe escaped, ashamed and happy at having gone there. Innocence alone can\ndare to be so bold. Once enlightened, virtue makes her calculations as\nwell as vice. Eugenie, who had not trembled beside her cousin, could\nscarcely stand upon her legs when she regained her chamber. Her ignorant\nlife had suddenly come to an end; she reasoned, she rebuked herself with\nmany reproaches.\n\n\"What will he think of me? He will think that I love him!\"\n\nThat was what she most wished him to think. An honest love has its own\nprescience, and knows that love begets love. What an event for this poor\nsolitary girl thus to have entered the chamber of a young man! Are there\nnot thoughts and actions in the life of love which to certain souls bear\nthe full meaning of the holiest espousals? An hour later she went to\nher mother and dressed her as usual. Then they both came down and sat\nin their places before the window waiting for Grandet, with that cruel\nanxiety which, according to the individual character, freezes the\nheart or warms it, shrivels or dilates it, when a scene is feared, a\npunishment expected,--a feeling so natural that even domestic animals\npossess it, and whine at the slightest pain of punishment, though they\nmake no outcry when they inadvertently hurt themselves. The goodman came\ndown; but he spoke to his wife with an absent manner, kissed Eugenie,\nand sat down to table without appearing to remember his threats of the\nnight before.\n\n\"What has become of my nephew? The lad gives no trouble.\"\n\n\"Monsieur, he is asleep,\" answered Nanon.\n\n\"So much the better; he won't want a wax candle,\" said Grandet in a\njeering tone.\n\nThis unusual clemency, this bitter gaiety, struck Madame Grandet with\namazement, and she looked at her husband attentively. The goodman--here\nit may be well to explain that in Touraine, Anjou, Pitou, and Bretagne\nthe word \"goodman,\" already used to designate Grandet, is bestowed as\noften upon harsh and cruel men as upon those of kindly temperament, when\neither have reached a certain age; the title means nothing on the score\nof individual gentleness--the goodman took his hat and gloves, saying as\nhe went out,--\n\n\"I am going to loiter about the market-place and find Cruchot.\"\n\n\"Eugenie, your father certainly has something on his mind.\"\n\nGrandet, who was a poor sleeper, employed half his nights in the\npreliminary calculations which gave such astonishing accuracy to his\nviews and observations and schemes, and secured to them the unfailing\nsuccess at sight of which his townsmen stood amazed. All human power is\na compound of time and patience. Powerful beings will and wait. The life\nof a miser is the constant exercise of human power put to the service of\nself. It rests on two sentiments only,--self-love and self-interest;\nbut self-interest being to a certain extent compact and intelligent\nself-love, the visible sign of real superiority, it follows that\nself-love and self-interest are two parts of the same whole,--egotism.\nFrom this arises, perhaps, the excessive curiosity shown in the habits\nof a miser's life whenever they are put before the world. Every nature\nholds by a thread to those beings who challenge all human sentiments by\nconcentrating all in one passion. Where is the man without desire? and\nwhat social desire can be satisfied without money?\n\nGrandet unquestionably \"had something on his mind,\" to use his wife's\nexpression. There was in him, as in all misers, a persistent craving to\nplay a commercial game with other men and win their money legally. To\nimpose upon other people was to him a sign of power, a perpetual proof\nthat he had won the right to despise those feeble beings who suffer\nthemselves to be preyed upon in this world. Oh! who has ever truly\nunderstood the lamb lying peacefully at the feet of God?--touching\nemblem of all terrestrial victims, myth of their future, suffering and\nweakness glorified! This lamb it is which the miser fattens, puts in his\nfold, slaughters, cooks, eats, and then despises. The pasture of misers\nis compounded of money and disdain. During the night Grandet's ideas had\ntaken another course, which was the reason of his sudden clemency. He\nhad hatched a plot by which to trick the Parisians, to decoy and dupe\nand snare them, to drive them into a trap, and make them go and come and\nsweat and hope and turn pale,--a plot by which to amuse himself, the old\nprovincial cooper, sitting there beneath his gloomy rafters, or passing\nup and down the rotten staircase of his house in Saumur. His nephew\nfilled his mind. He wished to save the honor of his dead brother without\nthe cost of a penny to the son or to himself. His own funds he was about\nto invest for three years; he had therefore nothing further to do than\nto manage his property in Saumur. He needed some nutriment for his\nmalicious activity, and he found it suddenly in his brother's failure.\nFeeling nothing to squeeze between his own paws, he resolved to crush\nthe Parisians in behalf of Charles, and to play the part of a good\nbrother on the cheapest terms. The honor of the family counted for so\nlittle in this scheme that his good intentions might be likened to the\ninterest a gambler takes in seeing a game well played in which he has no\nstake. The Cruchots were a necessary part of his plan; but he would not\nseek them,--he resolved to make them come to him, and to lead up that\nvery evening to a comedy whose plot he had just conceived, which should\nmake him on the morrow an object of admiration to the whole town without\nits costing him a single penny.\n\nIn her father's absence Eugenie had the happiness of busying herself\nopenly with her much-loved cousin, of spending upon him fearlessly\nthe treasures of her pity,--woman's sublime superiority, the sole she\ndesires to have recognized, the sole she pardons man for letting\nher assume. Three or four times the young girl went to listen to her\ncousin's breathing, to know if he were sleeping or awake; then, when he\nhad risen, she turned her thoughts to the cream, the eggs, the fruits,\nthe plates, the glasses,--all that was a part of his breakfast became\nthe object of some special care. At length she ran lightly up the old\nstaircase to listen to the noise her cousin made. Was he dressing? Did\nhe still weep? She reached the door.\n\n\"My cousin!\"\n\n\"Yes, cousin.\"\n\n\"Will you breakfast downstairs, or in your room?\"\n\n\"Where you like.\"\n\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Dear cousin, I am ashamed of being hungry.\"\n\nThis conversation, held through the closed door, was like an episode in\na poem to Eugenie.\n\n\"Well, then, we will bring your breakfast to your own room, so as not to\nannoy my father.\"\n\nShe ran to the kitchen with the swiftness and lightness of a bird.\n\n\"Nanon, go and do his room!\"\n\nThat staircase, so often traversed, which echoed to the slightest noise,\nnow lost its decaying aspect in the eyes of Eugenie. It grew luminous;\nit had a voice and spoke to her; it was young like herself,--young like\nthe love it was now serving. Her mother, her kind, indulgent mother,\nlent herself to the caprices of the child's love, and after the room\nwas put in order, both went to sit with the unhappy youth and keep him\ncompany. Does not Christian charity make consolation a duty? The two\nwomen drew a goodly number of little sophistries from their religion\nwherewith to justify their conduct. Charles was made the object of the\ntenderest and most loving care. His saddened heart felt the sweetness\nof the gentle friendship, the exquisite sympathy which these two souls,\ncrushed under perpetual restraint, knew so well how to display when, for\nan instant, they were left unfettered in the regions of suffering, their\nnatural sphere.\n\nClaiming the right of relationship, Eugenie began to fold the linen and\nput in order the toilet articles which Charles had brought; thus she\ncould marvel at her ease over each luxurious bauble and the various\nknick-knacks of silver or chased gold, which she held long in her hand\nunder a pretext of examining them. Charles could not see without emotion\nthe generous interest his aunt and cousin felt in him; he knew society\nin Paris well enough to feel assured that, placed as he now was, he\nwould find all hearts indifferent or cold. Eugenie thus appeared to him\nin the splendor of a special beauty, and from thenceforth he admired\nthe innocence of life and manners which the previous evening he had been\ninclined to ridicule. So when Eugenie took from Nanon the bowl of coffee\nand cream, and began to pour it out for her cousin with the simplicity\nof real feeling, giving him a kindly glance, the eyes of the Parisian\nfilled with tears; he took her hand and kissed it.\n\n\"What troubles you?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh! these are tears of gratitude,\" he answered.\n\nEugenie turned abruptly to the chimney-piece to take the candlesticks.\n\n\"Here, Nanon, carry them away!\" she said.\n\nWhen she looked again towards her cousin she was still blushing, but her\nlooks could at least deceive, and did not betray the excess of joy which\ninnundated her heart; yet the eyes of both expressed the same sentiment\nas their souls flowed together in one thought,--the future was theirs.\nThis soft emotion was all the more precious to Charles in the midst\nof his heavy grief because it was wholly unexpected. The sound of the\nknocker recalled the women to their usual station. Happily they were\nable to run downstairs with sufficient rapidity to be seated at their\nwork when Grandet entered; had he met them under the archway it would\nhave been enough to rouse his suspicions. After breakfast, which the\ngoodman took standing, the keeper from Froidfond, to whom the promised\nindemnity had never yet been paid, made his appearance, bearing a hare\nand some partridges shot in the park, with eels and two pike sent as\ntribute by the millers.\n\n\"Ha, ha! poor Cornoiller; here he comes, like fish in Lent. Is all that\nfit to eat?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, generous master; it has been killed two days.\"\n\n\"Come, Nanon, bestir yourself,\" said Grandet; \"take these things,\nthey'll do for dinner. I have invited the two Cruchots.\"\n\nNanon opened her eyes, stupid with amazement, and looked at everybody in\nthe room.\n\n\"Well!\" she said, \"and how am I to get the lard and the spices?\"\n\n\"Wife,\" said Grandet, \"give Nanon six francs, and remind me to get some\nof the good wine out of the cellar.\"\n\n\"Well, then, Monsieur Grandet,\" said the keeper, who had come prepared\nwith an harangue for the purpose of settling the question of the\nindemnity, \"Monsieur Grandet--\"\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta!\" said Grandet; \"I know what you want to say. You are a\ngood fellow; we will see about it to-morrow, I'm too busy to-day. Wife,\ngive him five francs,\" he added to Madame Grandet as he decamped.\n\nThe poor woman was only too happy to buy peace at the cost of eleven\nfrancs. She knew that Grandet would let her alone for a fortnight after\nhe had thus taken back, franc by franc, the money he had given her.\n\n\"Here, Cornoiller,\" she said, slipping ten francs into the man's hand,\n\"some day we will reward your services.\"\n\nCornoiller could say nothing, so he went away.\n\n\"Madame,\" said Nanon, who had put on her black coif and taken her\nbasket, \"I want only three francs. You keep the rest; it'll go fast\nenough somehow.\"\n\n\"Have a good dinner, Nanon; my cousin will come down,\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"Something very extraordinary is going on, I am certain of it,\" said\nMadame Grandet. \"This is only the third time since our marriage that\nyour father has given a dinner.\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nAbout four o'clock, just as Eugenie and her mother had finished setting\nthe table for six persons, and after the master of the house had brought\nup a few bottles of the exquisite wine which provincials cherish with\ntrue affection, Charles came down into the hall. The young fellow was\npale; his gestures, the expression of his face, his glance, and the\ntones of his voice, all had a sadness which was full of grace. He was\nnot pretending grief, he truly suffered; and the veil of pain cast over\nhis features gave him an interesting air dear to the heart of women.\nEugenie loved him the more for it. Perhaps she felt that sorrow drew him\nnearer to her. Charles was no longer the rich and distinguished young\nman placed in a sphere far above her, but a relation plunged into\nfrightful misery. Misery begets equality. Women have this in common with\nthe angels,--suffering humanity belongs to them. Charles and Eugenie\nunderstood each other and spoke only with their eyes; for the poor\nfallen dandy, orphaned and impoverished, sat apart in a corner of the\nroom, and was proudly calm and silent. Yet, from time to time, the\ngentle and caressing glance of the young girl shone upon him and\nconstrained him away from his sad thoughts, drawing him with her into\nthe fields of hope and of futurity, where she loved to hold him at her\nside.\n\n\n\n\nVII\n\nAt this moment the town of Saumur was more excited about the dinner\ngiven by Grandet to the Cruchots than it had been the night before at\nthe sale of his vintage, though that constituted a crime of high-treason\nagainst the whole wine-growing community. If the politic old miser had\ngiven his dinner from the same idea that cost the dog of Alcibiades his\ntail, he might perhaps have been called a great man; but the fact is,\nconsidering himself superior to a community which he could trick on all\noccasions, he paid very little heed to what Saumur might say.\n\nThe des Grassins soon learned the facts of the failure and the violent\ndeath of Guillaume Grandet, and they determined to go to their client's\nhouse that very evening to commiserate his misfortune and show him some\nmarks of friendship, with a view of ascertaining the motives which had\nled him to invite the Cruchots to dinner. At precisely five o'clock\nMonsieur C. de Bonfons and his uncle the notary arrived in their\nSunday clothes. The party sat down to table and began to dine with good\nappetites. Grandet was grave, Charles silent, Eugenie dumb, and Madame\nGrandet did not say more than usual; so that the dinner was, very\nproperly, a repast of condolence. When they rose from table Charles said\nto his aunt and uncle,--\n\n\"Will you permit me to retire? I am obliged to undertake a long and\npainful correspondence.\"\n\n\"Certainly, nephew.\"\n\nAs soon as the goodman was certain that Charles could hear nothing and\nwas probably deep in his letter-writing, he said, with a dissimulating\nglance at his wife,--\n\n\"Madame Grandet, what we have to talk about will be Latin to you; it\nis half-past seven; you can go and attend to your household accounts.\nGood-night, my daughter.\"\n\nHe kissed Eugenie, and the two women departed. A scene now took place in\nwhich Pere Grandet brought to bear, more than at any other moment of his\nlife, the shrewd dexterity he had acquired in his intercourse with\nmen, and which had won him from those whose flesh he sometimes bit\ntoo sharply the nickname of \"the old dog.\" If the mayor of Saumur had\ncarried his ambition higher still, if fortunate circumstances, drawing\nhim towards the higher social spheres, had sent him into congresses\nwhere the affairs of nations were discussed, and had he there employed\nthe genius with which his personal interests had endowed him, he would\nundoubtedly have proved nobly useful to his native land. Yet it is\nperhaps equally certain that outside of Saumur the goodman would have\ncut a very sorry figure. Possibly there are minds like certain animals\nwhich cease to breed when transplanted from the climates in which they\nare born.\n\n\"M-m-mon-sieur le p-p-president, you said t-t-that b-b-bankruptcy--\"\n\nThe stutter which for years the old miser had assumed when it suited\nhim, and which, together with the deafness of which he sometimes\ncomplained in rainy weather, was thought in Saumur to be a natural\ndefect, became at this crisis so wearisome to the two Cruchots that\nwhile they listened they unconsciously made faces and moved their lips,\nas if pronouncing the words over which he was hesitating and stuttering\nat will. Here it may be well to give the history of this impediment\nof the speech and hearing of Monsieur Grandet. No one in Anjou heard\nbetter, or could pronounce more crisply the French language (with an\nAngevin accent) than the wily old cooper. Some years earlier, in spite\nof his shrewdness, he had been taken in by an Israelite, who in the\ncourse of the discussion held his hand behind his ear to catch sounds,\nand mangled his meaning so thoroughly in trying to utter his words that\nGrandet fell a victim to his humanity and was compelled to prompt the\nwily Jew with the words and ideas he seemed to seek, to complete himself\nthe arguments of the said Jew, to say what that cursed Jew ought to have\nsaid for himself; in short, to be the Jew instead of being Grandet. When\nthe cooper came out of this curious encounter he had concluded the only\nbargain of which in the course of a long commercial life he ever had\noccasion to complain. But if he lost at the time pecuniarily, he gained\nmorally a valuable lesson; later, he gathered its fruits. Indeed, the\ngoodman ended by blessing that Jew for having taught him the art of\nirritating his commercial antagonist and leading him to forget his own\nthoughts in his impatience to suggest those over which his tormentor\nwas stuttering. No affair had ever needed the assistance of deafness,\nimpediments of speech, and all the incomprehensible circumlocutions with\nwhich Grandet enveloped his ideas, as much as the affair now in hand. In\nthe first place, he did not mean to shoulder the responsibility of\nhis own scheme; in the next, he was determined to remain master of the\nconversation and to leave his real intentions in doubt.\n\n\"M-m-monsieur de B-B-Bonfons,\"--for the second time in three years\nGrandet called the Cruchot nephew Monsieur de Bonfons; the\npresident felt he might consider himself the artful old fellow's\nson-in-law,--\"you-ou said th-th-that b-b-bankruptcy c-c-could, in some\nc-c-cases, b-b-be p-p-prevented b-b-by--\"\n\n\"By the courts of commerce themselves. It is done constantly,\" said\nMonsieur C. de Bonfons, bestriding Grandet's meaning, or thinking he\nguessed it, and kindly wishing to help him out with it. \"Listen.\"\n\n\"Y-yes,\" said Grandet humbly, with the mischievous expression of a boy\nwho is inwardly laughing at his teacher while he pays him the greatest\nattention.\n\n\"When a man so respected and important as, for example, your late\nbrother--\"\n\n\"M-my b-b-brother, yes.\"\n\n\"--is threatened with insolvency--\"\n\n\"They c-c-call it in-ins-s-solvency?\"\n\n\"Yes; when his failure is imminent, the court of commerce, to which he\nis amenable (please follow me attentively), has the power, by a decree,\nto appoint a receiver. Liquidation, you understand, is not the same\nas failure. When a man fails, he is dishonored; but when he merely\nliquidates, he remains an honest man.\"\n\n\"T-t-that's very d-d-different, if it d-d-doesn't c-c-cost m-m-more,\"\nsaid Grandet.\n\n\"But a liquidation can be managed without having recourse to the courts\nat all. For,\" said the president, sniffing a pinch of snuff, \"don't you\nknow how failures are declared?\"\n\n\"N-n-no, I n-n-never t-t-thought,\" answered Grandet.\n\n\"In the first place,\" resumed the magistrate, \"by filing the schedule\nin the record office of the court, which the merchant may do himself, or\nhis representative for him with a power of attorney duly certified. In\nthe second place, the failure may be declared under compulsion from the\ncreditors. Now if the merchant does not file his schedule, and if no\ncreditor appears before the courts to obtain a decree of insolvency\nagainst the merchant, what happens?\"\n\n\"W-w-what h-h-happens?\"\n\n\"Why, the family of the deceased, his representatives, his heirs, or\nthe merchant himself, if he is not dead, or his friends if he is only\nhiding, liquidate his business. Perhaps you would like to liquidate your\nbrother's affairs?\"\n\n\"Ah! Grandet,\" said the notary, \"that would be the right thing to do.\nThere is honor down here in the provinces. If you save your name--for it\nis your name--you will be a man--\"\n\n\"A noble man!\" cried the president, interrupting his uncle.\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered the old man, \"my b-b-brother's name was\nG-G-Grandet, like m-m-mine. Th-that's c-c-certain; I d-d-don't d-d-deny\nit. And th-th-this l-l-liquidation might be, in m-m-many ways, v-v-very\nadvan-t-t-tageous t-t-to the interests of m-m-my n-n-nephew, whom\nI l-l-love. But I must consider. I don't k-k-know the t-t-tricks of\nP-P-Paris. I b-b-belong to Sau-m-mur, d-d-don't you see? M-m-my vines,\nmy d-d-drains--in short, I've my own b-b-business. I never g-g-give\nn-n-notes. What are n-n-notes? I t-t-take a good m-m-many, but I\nhave never s-s-signed one. I d-d-don't understand such things. I have\nh-h-heard say that n-n-notes c-c-can be b-b-bought up.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said the president. \"Notes can be bought in the market,\nless so much per cent. Don't you understand?\"\n\nGrandet made an ear-trumpet of his hand, and the president repeated his\nwords.\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied the man, \"there's s-s-something to be g-g-got out\nof it? I k-know n-nothing at my age about such th-th-things. I l-l-live\nhere and l-l-look after the v-v-vines. The vines g-g-grow, and it's the\nw-w-wine that p-p-pays. L-l-look after the v-v-vintage, t-t-that's my\nr-r-rule. My c-c-chief interests are at Froidfond. I c-c-can't l-l-leave\nmy h-h-house to m-m-muddle myself with a d-d-devilish b-b-business\nI kn-know n-n-nothing about. You say I ought to l-l-liquidate my\nb-b-brother's af-f-fairs, to p-p-prevent the f-f-failure. I c-c-can't be\nin two p-p-places at once, unless I were a little b-b-bird, and--\"\n\n\"I understand,\" cried the notary. \"Well, my old friend, you have\nfriends, old friends, capable of devoting themselves to your interests.\"\n\n\"All right!\" thought Grandet, \"make haste and come to the point!\"\n\n\"Suppose one of them went to Paris and saw your brother Guillaume's\nchief creditor and said to him--\"\n\n\"One m-m-moment,\" interrupted the goodman, \"said wh-wh-what? Something\nl-l-like this. Monsieur Gr-Grandet of Saumur this, Monsieur Grandet of\nSaumur that. He l-loves his b-b-brother, he loves his n-nephew. Grandet\nis a g-g-good uncle; he m-m-means well. He has sold his v-v-vintage.\nD-d-don't declare a f-f-failure; c-c-call a meeting; l-l-liquidate; and\nthen Gr-Gr-Grandet will see what he c-c-can do. B-b-better liquidate\nthan l-let the l-l-law st-st-stick its n-n-nose in. Hein? isn't it so?\"\n\n\"Exactly so,\" said the president.\n\n\"B-because, don't you see, Monsieur de B-Bonfons, a man must l-l-look\nb-b-before he l-leaps. If you c-c-can't, you c-c-can't. M-m-must know\nall about the m-m-matter, all the resources and the debts, if you\nd-d-don't want to be r-r-ruined. Hein? isn't it so?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the president. \"I'm of opinion that in a few months\nthe debts might be bought up for a certain sum, and then paid in full\nby an agreement. Ha! ha! you can coax a dog a long way if you show him a\nbit of lard. If there has been no declaration of failure, and you hold\na lien on the debts, you come out of the business as white as the driven\nsnow.\"\n\n\"Sn-n-now,\" said Grandet, putting his hand to his ear, \"wh-wh-what about\ns-now?\"\n\n\"But,\" cried the president, \"do pray attend to what I am saying.\"\n\n\"I am at-t-tending.\"\n\n\"A note is merchandise,--an article of barter which rises and falls in\nprices. That is a deduction from Jeremy Bentham's theory about usury.\nThat writer has proved that the prejudice which condemned usurers to\nreprobation was mere folly.\"\n\n\"Whew!\" ejaculated the goodman.\n\n\"Allowing that money, according to Bentham, is an article of\nmerchandise, and that whatever represents money is equally merchandise,\"\nresumed the president; \"allowing also that it is notorious that the\ncommercial note, bearing this or that signature, is liable to the\nfluctuation of all commercial values, rises or falls in the market,\nis dear at one moment, and is worth nothing at another, the courts\ndecide--ah! how stupid I am, I beg your pardon--I am inclined to think\nyou could buy up your brother's debts for twenty-five per cent.\"\n\n\"D-d-did you c-c-call him Je-Je-Jeremy B-Ben?\"\n\n\"Bentham, an Englishman.'\n\n\"That's a Jeremy who might save us a lot of lamentations in business,\"\nsaid the notary, laughing.\n\n\"Those Englishmen s-sometimes t-t-talk sense,\" said Grandet. \"So,\nac-c-cording to Ben-Bentham, if my b-b-brother's n-notes are worth\nn-n-nothing; if Je-Je--I'm c-c-correct, am I not? That seems c-c-clear\nto my m-m-mind--the c-c-creditors would be--No, would not be; I\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"Let me explain it all,\" said the president. \"Legally, if you acquire a\ntitle to all the debts of the Maison Grandet, your brother or his heirs\nwill owe nothing to any one. Very good.\"\n\n\"Very g-good,\" repeated Grandet.\n\n\"In equity, if your brother's notes are negotiated--negotiated, do you\nclearly understand the term?--negotiated in the market at a reduction\nof so much per cent in value, and if one of your friends happening to be\npresent should buy them in, the creditors having sold them of their\nown free-will without constraint, the estate of the late Grandet is\nhonorably released.\"\n\n\"That's t-true; b-b-business is b-business,\" said the cooper. \"B-b-but,\nst-still, you know, it is d-d-difficult. I h-have n-no m-m-money and\nn-no t-t-time.\"\n\n\"Yes, but you need not undertake it. I am quite ready to go to Paris\n(you may pay my expenses, they will only be a trifle). I will see\nthe creditors and talk with them and get an extension of time, and\neverything can be arranged if you will add something to the assets so as\nto buy up all title to the debts.\"\n\n\"We-we'll see about th-that. I c-c-can't and I w-w-won't bind myself\nwithout--He who c-c-can't, can't; don't you see?\"\n\n\"That's very true.\"\n\n\"I'm all p-p-put ab-b-bout by what you've t-t-told me. This is the\nf-first t-t-time in my life I have b-been obliged to th-th-think--\"\n\n\"Yes, you are not a lawyer.\"\n\n\"I'm only a p-p-poor wine-g-grower, and know n-nothing about wh-what you\nhave just t-told me; I m-m-must th-think about it.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the president, preparing to resume his argument.\n\n\"Nephew!\" said the notary, interrupting him in a warning tone.\n\n\"Well, what, uncle?\" answered the president.\n\n\"Let Monsieur Grandet explain his own intentions. The matter in question\nis of the first importance. Our good friend ought to define his meaning\nclearly, and--\"\n\nA loud knock, which announced the arrival of the des Grassins family,\nsucceeded by their entrance and salutations, hindered Cruchot from\nconcluding his sentence. The notary was glad of the interruption, for\nGrandet was beginning to look suspiciously at him, and the wen gave\nsigns of a brewing storm. In the first place, the notary did not think\nit becoming in a president of the Civil courts to go to Paris and\nmanipulate creditors and lend himself to an underhand job which clashed\nwith the laws of strict integrity; moreover, never having known old\nGrandet to express the slightest desire to pay anything, no matter what,\nhe instinctively feared to see his nephew taking part in the affair.\nHe therefore profited by the entrance of the des Grassins to take the\nnephew by the arm and lead him into the embrasure of the window,--\n\n\"You have said enough, nephew; you've shown enough devotion. Your desire\nto win the girl blinds you. The devil! you mustn't go at it tooth and\nnail. Let me sail the ship now; you can haul on the braces. Do you think\nit right to compromise your dignity as a magistrate in such a--\"\n\nHe stopped, for he heard Monsieur des Grassins saying to the old cooper\nas they shook hands,--\n\n\"Grandet, we have heard of the frightful misfortunes which have just\nbefallen your family,--the failure of the house of Guillaume Grandet and\nthe death of your brother. We have come to express our grief at these\nsad events.\"\n\n\"There is but one sad event,\" said the notary, interrupting the\nbanker,--\"the death of Monsieur Grandet, junior; and he would never have\nkilled himself had he thought in time of applying to his brother for\nhelp. Our old friend, who is honorable to his finger-nails, intends\nto liquidate the debts of the Maison Grandet of Paris. To save him the\nworry of legal proceedings, my nephew, the president, has just offered\nto go to Paris and negotiate with the creditors for a satisfactory\nsettlement.\"\n\nThese words, corroborated by Grandet's attitude as he stood silently\nnursing his chin, astonished the three des Grassins, who had been\nleisurely discussing the old man's avarice as they came along, very\nnearly accusing him of fratricide.\n\n\"Ah! I was sure of it,\" cried the banker, looking at his wife. \"What did\nI tell you just now, Madame des Grassins? Grandet is honorable to the\nbackbone, and would never allow his name to remain under the slightest\ncloud! Money without honor is a disease. There is honor in the\nprovinces! Right, very right, Grandet. I'm an old soldier, and I can't\ndisguise my thoughts; I speak roughly. Thunder! it is sublime!\"\n\n\"Th-then s-s-sublime th-things c-c-cost d-dear,\" answered the goodman,\nas the banker warmly wrung his hand.\n\n\"But this, my dear Grandet,--if the president will excuse me,--is a\npurely commercial matter, and needs a consummate business man. Your\nagent must be some one fully acquainted with the markets,--with\ndisbursements, rebates, interest calculations, and so forth. I am going\nto Paris on business of my own, and I can take charge of--\"\n\n\"We'll see about t-t-trying to m-m-manage it b-b-between us, under the\np-p-peculiar c-c-circumstances, b-b-but without b-b-binding m-m-myself\nto anything th-that I c-c-could not do,\" said Grandet, stuttering;\n\"because, you see, monsieur le president naturally expects me to pay the\nexpenses of his journey.\"\n\nThe goodman did not stammer over the last words.\n\n\"Eh!\" cried Madame des Grassins, \"why it is a pleasure to go to Paris. I\nwould willingly pay to go myself.\"\n\nShe made a sign to her husband, as if to encourage him in cutting\nthe enemy out of the commission, _coute que coute_; then she glanced\nironically at the two Cruchots, who looked chap-fallen. Grandet seized\nthe banker by a button and drew him into a corner of the room.\n\n\"I have a great deal more confidence in you than in the president,\" he\nsaid; \"besides, I've other fish to fry,\" he added, wriggling his wen. \"I\nwant to buy a few thousand francs in the Funds while they are at eighty.\nThey fall, I'm told, at the end of each month. You know all about these\nthings, don't you?\"\n\n\"Bless me! then, am I to invest enough to give you a few thousand francs\na year?\"\n\n\"That's not much to begin with. Hush! I don't want any one to know I am\ngoing to play that game. You can make the investment by the end of\nthe month. Say nothing to the Cruchots; that'll annoy them. If you are\nreally going to Paris, we will see if there is anything to be done for\nmy poor nephew.\"\n\n\"Well, it's all settled. I'll start to-morrow by the mail-post,\" said\ndes Grassins aloud, \"and I will come and take your last directions\nat--what hour will suit you?\"\n\n\"Five o'clock, just before dinner,\" said Grandet, rubbing his hands.\n\nThe two parties stayed on for a short time. Des Grassins said, after a\npause, striking Grandet on the shoulder,--\n\n\"It is a good thing to have a relation like him.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; without making a show,\" said Grandet, \"I am a g-good\nrelation. I loved my brother, and I will prove it, unless it\nc-c-costs--\"\n\n\"We must leave you, Grandet,\" said the banker, interrupting him\nfortunately before he got to the end of his sentence. \"If I hurry my\ndeparture, I must attend to some matters at once.\"\n\n\"Very good, very good! I myself--in c-consequence of what I t-told\nyou--I must retire to my own room and 'd-d-deliberate,' as President\nCruchot says.\"\n\n\"Plague take him! I am no longer Monsieur de Bonfons,\" thought the\nmagistrate ruefully, his face assuming the expression of a judge bored\nby an argument.\n\nThe heads of the two factions walked off together. Neither gave any\nfurther thought to the treachery Grandet had been guilty of in the\nmorning against the whole wine-growing community; each tried to fathom\nwhat the other was thinking about the real intentions of the wily old\nman in this new affair, but in vain.\n\n\"Will you go with us to Madame Dorsonval's?\" said des Grassins to the\nnotary.\n\n\"We will go there later,\" answered the president. \"I have promised to\nsay good-evening to Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt, and we will go there\nfirst, if my uncle is willing.\"\n\n\"Farewell for the present!\" said Madame des Grassins.\n\nWhen the Cruchots were a few steps off, Adolphe remarked to his\nfather,--\n\n\"Are not they fuming, hein?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, my son!\" said his mother; \"they might hear you.\nBesides, what you say is not in good taste,--law-school language.\"\n\n\"Well, uncle,\" cried the president when he saw the des Grassins\ndisappearing, \"I began by being de Bonfons, and I have ended as nothing\nbut Cruchot.\"\n\n\"I saw that that annoyed you; but the wind has set fair for the des\nGrassins. What a fool you are, with all your cleverness! Let them sail\noff on Grandet's 'We'll see about it,' and keep yourself quiet, young\nman. Eugenie will none the less be your wife.\"\n\nIn a few moments the news of Grandet's magnanimous resolve was\ndisseminated in three houses at the same moment, and the whole town\nbegan to talk of his fraternal devotion. Every one forgave Grandet for\nthe sale made in defiance of the good faith pledged to the community;\nthey admired his sense of honor, and began to laud a generosity of which\nthey had never thought him capable. It is part of the French nature to\ngrow enthusiastic, or angry, or fervent about some meteor of the moment.\nCan it be that collective beings, nationalities, peoples, are devoid of\nmemory?\n\nWhen Pere Grandet had shut the door he called Nanon.\n\n\"Don't let the dog loose, and don't go to bed; we have work to do\ntogether. At eleven o'clock Cornoiller will be at the door with the\nchariot from Froidfond. Listen for him and prevent his knocking; tell\nhim to come in softly. Police regulations don't allow nocturnal racket.\nBesides, the whole neighborhood need not know that I am starting on a\njourney.\"\n\nSo saying, Grandet returned to his private room, where Nanon heard\nhim moving about, rummaging, and walking to and fro, though with much\nprecaution, for he evidently did not wish to wake his wife and daughter,\nand above all not to rouse the attention of his nephew, whom he had\nbegun to anathematize when he saw a thread of light under his door.\nAbout the middle of the night Eugenie, intent on her cousin, fancied\nshe heard a cry like that of a dying person. It must be Charles, she\nthought; he was so pale, so full of despair when she had seen him\nlast,--could he have killed himself? She wrapped herself quickly in a\nloose garment,--a sort of pelisse with a hood,--and was about to leave\nthe room when a bright light coming through the chinks of her door made\nher think of fire. But she recovered herself as she heard Nanon's heavy\nsteps and gruff voice mingling with the snorting of several horses.\n\n\"Can my father be carrying off my cousin?\" she said to herself, opening\nher door with great precaution lest it should creak, and yet enough to\nlet her see into the corridor.\n\nSuddenly her eye encountered that of her father; and his glance, vague\nand unnoticing as it was, terrified her. The goodman and Nanon were\nyoked together by a stout stick, each end of which rested on their\nshoulders; a stout rope was passed over it, on which was slung a small\nbarrel or keg like those Pere Grandet still made in his bakehouse as an\namusement for his leisure hours.\n\n\"Holy Virgin, how heavy it is!\" said the voice of Nanon.\n\n\"What a pity that it is only copper sous!\" answered Grandet. \"Take care\nyou don't knock over the candlestick.\"\n\nThe scene was lighted by a single candle placed between two rails of the\nstaircase.\n\n\"Cornoiller,\" said Grandet to his keeper _in partibus_, \"have you\nbrought your pistols?\"\n\n\"No, monsieur. Mercy! what's there to fear for your copper sous?\"\n\n\"Oh! nothing,\" said Pere Grandet.\n\n\"Besides, we shall go fast,\" added the man; \"your farmers have picked\nout their best horses.\"\n\n\"Very good. You did not tell them where I was going?\"\n\n\"I didn't know where.\"\n\n\"Very good. Is the carriage strong?\"\n\n\"Strong? hear to that, now! Why, it can carry three thousand weight. How\nmuch does that old keg weigh?\"\n\n\"Goodness!\" exclaimed Nanon. \"I ought to know! There's pretty nigh\neighteen hundred--\"\n\n\"Will you hold your tongue, Nanon! You are to tell my wife I have gone\ninto the country. I shall be back to dinner. Drive fast, Cornoiller; I\nmust get to Angers before nine o'clock.\"\n\nThe carriage drove off. Nanon bolted the great door, let loose the dog,\nand went off to bed with a bruised shoulder, no one in the neighborhood\nsuspecting either the departure of Grandet or the object of his journey.\nThe precautions of the old miser and his reticence were never relaxed.\nNo one had ever seen a penny in that house, filled as it was with gold.\nHearing in the morning, through the gossip of the port, that exchange\non gold had doubled in price in consequence of certain military\npreparations undertaken at Nantes, and that speculators had arrived\nat Angers to buy coin, the old wine-grower, by the simple process of\nborrowing horses from his farmers, seized the chance of selling his gold\nand of bringing back in the form of treasury notes the sum he intended\nto put into the Funds, having swelled it considerably by the exchange.\n\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\"My father has gone,\" thought Eugenie, who heard all that took place\nfrom the head of the stairs. Silence was restored in the house, and the\ndistant rumbling of the carriage, ceasing by degrees, no longer echoed\nthrough the sleeping town. At this moment Eugenie heard in her heart,\nbefore the sound caught her ears, a cry which pierced the partitions and\ncame from her cousin's chamber. A line of light, thin as the blade of\na sabre, shone through a chink in the door and fell horizontally on the\nbalusters of the rotten staircase.\n\n\"He suffers!\" she said, springing up the stairs. A second moan brought\nher to the landing near his room. The door was ajar, she pushed it open.\nCharles was sleeping; his head hung over the side of the old armchair,\nand his hand, from which the pen had fallen, nearly touched the\nfloor. The oppressed breathing caused by the strained posture suddenly\nfrightened Eugenie, who entered the room hastily.\n\n\"He must be very tired,\" she said to herself, glancing at a dozen\nletters lying sealed upon the table. She read their addresses: \"To\nMessrs. Farry, Breilmann, & Co., carriage-makers\"; \"To Monsieur Buisson,\ntailor,\" etc.\n\n\"He has been settling all his affairs, so as to leave France at once,\"\nshe thought. Her eyes fell upon two open letters. The words, \"My dear\nAnnette,\" at the head of one of them, blinded her for a moment. Her\nheart beat fast, her feet were nailed to the floor.\n\n\"His dear Annette! He loves! he is loved! No hope! What does he say to\nher?\"\n\nThese thoughts rushed through her head and heart. She saw the words\neverywhere, even on the bricks of the floor, in letters of fire.\n\n\"Resign him already? No, no! I will not read the letter. I ought to go\naway--What if I do read it?\"\n\nShe looked at Charles, then she gently took his head and placed it\nagainst the back of the chair; he let her do so, like a child which,\nthough asleep, knows its mother's touch and receives, without awaking,\nher kisses and watchful care. Like a mother Eugenie raised the drooping\nhand, and like a mother she gently kissed the chestnut hair--\"Dear\nAnnette!\" a demon shrieked the words in her ear.\n\n\"I am doing wrong; but I must read it, that letter,\" she said. She\nturned away her head, for her noble sense of honor reproached her.\nFor the first time in her life good and evil struggled together in her\nheart. Up to that moment she had never had to blush for any action.\nPassion and curiosity triumphed. As she read each sentence her heart\nswelled more and more, and the keen glow which filled her being as she\ndid so, only made the joys of first love still more precious.\n\n  My dear Annette,--Nothing could ever have separated us but the\n  great misfortune which has now overwhelmed me, and which no human\n  foresight could have prevented. My father has killed himself; his\n  fortune and mine are irretrievably lost. I am orphaned at an age\n  when, through the nature of my education, I am still a child; and\n  yet I must lift myself as a man out of the abyss into which I am\n  plunged. I have just spent half the night in facing my position.\n  If I wish to leave France an honest man,--and there is no doubt of\n  that,--I have not a hundred francs of my own with which to try my\n  fate in the Indies or in America. Yes, my poor Anna, I must seek\n  my fortune in those deadly climates. Under those skies, they tell\n  me, I am sure to make it. As for remaining in Paris, I cannot do\n  so. Neither my nature nor my face are made to bear the affronts,\n  the neglect, the disdain shown to a ruined man, the son of a\n  bankrupt! Good God! think of owing two millions! I should be\n  killed in a duel the first week; therefore I shall not return\n  there. Your love--the most tender and devoted love which ever\n  ennobled the heart of man--cannot draw me back. Alas! my beloved,\n  I have no money with which to go to you, to give and receive a\n  last kiss from which I might derive some strength for my forlorn\n  enterprise.\n\n\"Poor Charles! I did well to read the letter. I have gold; I will give\nit to him,\" thought Eugenie.\n\nShe wiped her eyes, and went on reading.\n\n  I have never thought of the miseries of poverty. If I have the\n  hundred louis required for the mere costs of the journey, I have\n  not a sou for an outfit. But no, I have not the hundred louis, not\n  even one louis. I don't know that anything will be left after I\n  have paid my debts in Paris. If I have nothing, I shall go quietly\n  to Nantes and ship as a common sailor; and I will begin in the new\n  world like other men who have started young without a sou and\n  brought back the wealth of the Indies. During this long day I have\n  faced my future coolly. It seems more horrible for me than for\n  another, because I have been so petted by a mother who adored me,\n  so indulged by the kindest of fathers, so blessed by meeting, on\n  my entrance into life, with the love of an Anna! The flowers of\n  life are all I have ever known. Such happiness could not last.\n  Nevertheless, my dear Annette, I feel more courage than a careless\n  young man is supposed to feel,--above all a young man used to the\n  caressing ways of the dearest woman in all Paris, cradled in\n  family joys, on whom all things smiled in his home, whose wishes\n  were a law to his father--oh, my father! Annette, he is dead!\n\n  Well, I have thought over my position, and yours as well. I have\n  grown old in twenty-four hours. Dear Anna, if in order to keep me\n  with you in Paris you were to sacrifice your luxury, your dress,\n  your opera-box, we should even then not have enough for the\n  expenses of my extravagant ways of living. Besides, I would never\n  accept such sacrifices. No, we must part now and forever--\n\n\"He gives her up! Blessed Virgin! What happiness!\"\n\nEugenie quivered with joy. Charles made a movement, and a chill of\nterror ran through her. Fortunately, he did not wake, and she resumed\nher reading.\n\n  When shall I return? I do not know. The climate of the West Indies\n  ages a European, so they say; especially a European who works\n  hard. Let us think what may happen ten years hence. In ten years\n  your daughter will be eighteen; she will be your companion, your\n  spy. To you society will be cruel, and your daughter perhaps more\n  cruel still. We have seen cases of the harsh social judgment and\n  ingratitude of daughters; let us take warning by them. Keep in the\n  depths of your soul, as I shall in mine, the memory of four years\n  of happiness, and be faithful, if you can, to the memory of your\n  poor friend. I cannot exact such faithfulness, because, do you\n  see, dear Annette, I must conform to the exigencies of my new\n  life; I must take a commonplace view of them and do the best I\n  can. Therefore I must think of marriage, which becomes one of the\n  necessities of my future existence; and I will admit to you that I\n  have found, here in Saumur, in my uncle's house, a cousin whose\n  face, manners, mind, and heart would please you, and who, besides,\n  seems to me--\n\n\"He must have been very weary to have ceased writing to her,\" thought\nEugenie, as she gazed at the letter which stopped abruptly in the middle\nof the last sentence.\n\nAlready she defended him. How was it possible that an innocent girl\nshould perceive the cold-heartedness evinced by this letter? To young\ngirls religiously brought up, whose minds are ignorant and pure, all is\nlove from the moment they set their feet within the enchanted regions\nof that passion. They walk there bathed in a celestial light shed from\ntheir own souls, which reflects its rays upon their lover; they color\nall with the flame of their own emotion and attribute to him their\nhighest thoughts. A woman's errors come almost always from her belief\nin good or her confidence in truth. In Eugenie's simple heart the words,\n\"My dear Annette, my loved one,\" echoed like the sweetest language of\nlove; they caressed her soul as, in childhood, the divine notes of the\n_Venite adoremus_, repeated by the organ, caressed her ear. Moreover,\nthe tears which still lingered on the young man's lashes gave signs of\nthat nobility of heart by which young girls are rightly won. How could\nshe know that Charles, though he loved his father and mourned him truly,\nwas moved far more by paternal goodness than by the goodness of his own\nheart? Monsieur and Madame Guillaume Grandet, by gratifying every fancy\nof their son, and lavishing upon him the pleasures of a large fortune,\nhad kept him from making the horrible calculations of which so many\nsons in Paris become more or less guilty when, face to face with the\nenjoyments of the world, they form desires and conceive schemes which\nthey see with bitterness must be put off or laid aside during the\nlifetime of their parents. The liberality of the father in this instance\nhad shed into the heart of the son a real love, in which there was no\nafterthought of self-interest.\n\nNevertheless, Charles was a true child of Paris, taught by the customs\nof society and by Annette herself to calculate everything; already\nan old man under the mask of youth. He had gone through the frightful\neducation of social life, of that world where in one evening more crimes\nare committed in thought and speech than justice ever punishes at the\nassizes; where jests and clever sayings assassinate the noblest ideas;\nwhere no one is counted strong unless his mind sees clear: and to see\nclear in that world is to believe in nothing, neither in feelings, nor\nin men, nor even in events,--for events are falsified. There, to \"see\nclear\" we must weigh a friend's purse daily, learn how to keep ourselves\nadroitly on the top of the wave, cautiously admire nothing, neither\nworks of art nor glorious actions, and remember that self-interest is\nthe mainspring of all things here below. After committing many follies,\nthe great lady--the beautiful Annette--compelled Charles to think\nseriously; with her perfumed hand among his curls, she talked to him of\nhis future position; as she rearranged his locks, she taught him lessons\nof worldly prudence; she made him effeminate and materialized him,--a\ndouble corruption, but a delicate and elegant corruption, in the best\ntaste.\n\n\"You are very foolish, Charles,\" she would say to him. \"I shall have\na great deal of trouble in teaching you to understand the world. You\nbehaved extremely ill to Monsieur des Lupeaulx. I know very well he is\nnot an honorable man; but wait till he is no longer in power, then you\nmay despise him as much as you like. Do you know what Madame Campan used\nto tell us?--'My dears, as long as a man is a minister, adore him; when\nhe falls, help to drag him in the gutter. Powerful, he is a sort of god;\nfallen, he is lower than Marat in the sewer, because he is living, and\nMarat is dead. Life is a series of combinations, and you must study\nthem and understand them if you want to keep yourselves always in good\nposition.'\"\n\nCharles was too much a man of the world, his parents had made him too\nhappy, he had received too much adulation in society, to be possessed of\nnoble sentiments. The grain of gold dropped by his mother into his heart\nwas beaten thin in the smithy of Parisian society; he had spread it\nsuperficially, and it was worn away by the friction of life. Charles\nwas only twenty-one years old. At that age the freshness of youth seems\ninseparable from candor and sincerity of soul. The voice, the glance,\nthe face itself, seem in harmony with the feelings; and thus it happens\nthat the sternest judge, the most sceptical lawyer, the least complying\nof usurers, always hesitate to admit decrepitude of heart or the\ncorruption of worldly calculation while the eyes are still bathed\nin purity and no wrinkles seam the brow. Charles, so far, had had no\noccasion to apply the maxims of Parisian morality; up to this time he\nwas still endowed with the beauty of inexperience. And yet, unknown to\nhimself, he had been inoculated with selfishness. The germs of Parisian\npolitical economy, latent in his heart, would assuredly burst forth,\nsooner or later, whenever the careless spectator became an actor in the\ndrama of real life.\n\nNearly all young girls succumb to the tender promises such an outward\nappearance seems to offer: even if Eugenie had been as prudent and\nobserving as provincial girls are often found to be, she was not likely\nto distrust her cousin when his manners, words, and actions were still\nin unison with the aspirations of a youthful heart. A mere chance--a\nfatal chance--threw in her way the last effusions of real feeling which\nstirred the young man's soul; she heard as it were the last breathings\nof his conscience. She laid down the letter--to her so full of love--and\nbegan smilingly to watch her sleeping cousin; the fresh illusions of\nlife were still, for her at least, upon his face; she vowed to herself\nto love him always. Then she cast her eyes on the other letter, without\nattaching much importance to this second indiscretion; and though she\nread it, it was only to obtain new proofs of the noble qualities which,\nlike all women, she attributed to the man her heart had chosen.\n\n\n  My dear Alphonse,--When you receive this letter I shall be without\n  friends; but let me assure you that while I doubt the friendship\n  of the world, I have never doubted yours. I beg you therefore to\n  settle all my affairs, and I trust to you to get as much as you\n  can out of my possessions. By this time you know my situation. I\n  have nothing left, and I intend to go at once to the Indies. I\n  have just written to all the people to whom I think I owe money,\n  and you will find enclosed a list of their names, as correct as I\n  can make it from memory. My books, my furniture, my pictures, my\n  horses, etc., ought, I think, to pay my debts. I do not wish to\n  keep anything, except, perhaps, a few baubles which might serve as\n  the beginning of an outfit for my enterprise. My dear Alphonse, I\n  will send you a proper power of attorney under which you can make\n  these sales. Send me all my weapons. Keep Briton for yourself;\n  nobody would pay the value of that noble beast, and I would rather\n  give him to you--like a mourning-ring bequeathed by a dying man to\n  his executor. Farry, Breilmann, & Co. built me a very comfortable\n  travelling-carriage, which they have not yet delivered; persuade\n  them to keep it and not ask for any payment on it. If they refuse,\n  do what you can in the matter, and avoid everything that might\n  seem dishonorable in me under my present circumstances. I owe the\n  British Islander six louis, which I lost at cards; don't fail to\n  pay him--\n\n\n\"Dear cousin!\" whispered Eugenie, throwing down the letter and running\nsoftly back to her room, carrying one of the lighted candles. A thrill\nof pleasure passed over her as she opened the drawer of an old oak\ncabinet, a fine specimen of the period called the Renaissance, on which\ncould still be seen, partly effaced, the famous royal salamander. She\ntook from the drawer a large purse of red velvet with gold tassels,\nedged with a tarnished fringe of gold wire,--a relic inherited from her\ngrandmother. She weighed it proudly in her hand, and began with delight\nto count over the forgotten items of her little hoard. First she took\nout twenty _portugaises_, still new, struck in the reign of John V.,\n1725, worth by exchange, as her father told her, five _lisbonnines_,\nor a hundred and sixty-eight francs, sixty-four centimes each; their\nconventional value, however, was a hundred and eighty francs apiece, on\naccount of the rarity and beauty of the coins, which shone like little\nsuns. Item, five _genovines_, or five hundred-franc pieces of Genoa;\nanother very rare coin worth eighty-seven francs on exchange, but\na hundred francs to collectors. These had formerly belonged to old\nMonsieur de la Bertelliere. Item, three gold _quadruples_, Spanish, of\nPhilip V., struck in 1729, given to her one by one by Madame Gentillet,\nwho never failed to say, using the same words, when she made the gift,\n\"This dear little canary, this little yellow-boy, is worth ninety-eight\nfrancs! Keep it, my pretty one, it will be the flower of your treasure.\"\nItem (that which her father valued most of all, the gold of these coins\nbeing twenty-three carats and a fraction), a hundred Dutch ducats,\nmade in the year 1756, and worth thirteen francs apiece. Item, a great\ncuriosity, a species of medal precious to the soul of misers,--three\nrupees with the sign of the Scales, and five rupees with the sign of the\nVirgin, all in pure gold of twenty-four carats; the magnificent money\nof the Great Mogul, each of which was worth by mere weight thirty-seven\nfrancs, forty centimes, but at least fifty francs to those connoisseurs\nwho love to handle gold. Item, the napoleon of forty francs received\nthe day before, which she had forgotten to put away in the velvet purse.\nThis treasure was all in virgin coins, true works of art, which Grandet\nfrom time to time inquired after and asked to see, pointing out to his\ndaughter their intrinsic merits,--such as the beauty of the milled edge,\nthe clearness of the flat surface, the richness of the lettering, whose\nangles were not yet rubbed off.\n\nEugenie gave no thought to these rarities, nor to her father's mania for\nthem, nor to the danger she incurred in depriving herself of a treasure\nso dear to him; no, she thought only of her cousin, and soon made out,\nafter a few mistakes of calculation, that she possessed about five\nthousand eight hundred francs in actual value, which might be sold for\ntheir additional value to collectors for nearly six thousand. She looked\nat her wealth and clapped her hands like a happy child forced to\nspend its overflowing joy in artless movements of the body. Father and\ndaughter had each counted up their fortune this night,--he, to sell his\ngold; Eugenie to fling hers into the ocean of affection. She put the\npieces back into the old purse, took it in her hand, and ran upstairs\nwithout hesitation. The secret misery of her cousin made her forget the\nhour and conventional propriety; she was strong in her conscience, in\nher devotion, in her happiness.\n\nAs she stood upon the threshold of the door, holding the candle in one\nhand and the purse in the other, Charles woke, caught sight of her, and\nremained speechless with surprise. Eugenie came forward, put the candle\non the table, and said in a quivering voice:\n\n\"My cousin, I must beg pardon for a wrong I have done you; but God will\npardon me--if you--will help me to wipe it out.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Charles, rubbing his eyes.\n\n\"I have read those letters.\"\n\nCharles colored.\n\n\"How did it happen?\" she continued; \"how came I here? Truly, I do not\nknow. I am tempted not to regret too much that I have read them; they\nhave made me know your heart, your soul, and--\"\n\n\"And what?\" asked Charles.\n\n\"Your plans, your need of a sum--\"\n\n\"My dear cousin--\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! my cousin, not so loud; we must not wake others. See,\" she\nsaid, opening her purse, \"here are the savings of a poor girl who wants\nnothing. Charles, accept them! This morning I was ignorant of the value\nof money; you have taught it to me. It is but a means, after all. A\ncousin is almost a brother; you can surely borrow the purse of your\nsister.\"\n\nEugenie, as much a woman as a young girl, never dreamed of refusal; but\nher cousin remained silent.\n\n\"Oh! you will not refuse?\" cried Eugenie, the beatings of whose heart\ncould be heard in the deep silence.\n\nHer cousin's hesitation mortified her; but the sore need of his position\ncame clearer still to her mind, and she knelt down.\n\n\"I will never rise till you have taken that gold!\" she said. \"My cousin,\nI implore you, answer me! let me know if you respect me, if you are\ngenerous, if--\"\n\nAs he heard this cry of noble distress the young man's tears fell upon\nhis cousin's hands, which he had caught in his own to keep her from\nkneeling. As the warm tears touched her, Eugenie sprang to the purse and\npoured its contents upon the table.\n\n\"Ah! yes, yes, you consent?\" she said, weeping with joy. \"Fear nothing,\nmy cousin, you will be rich. This gold will bring you happiness; some\nday you shall bring it back to me,--are we not partners? I will obey all\nconditions. But you should not attach such value to the gift.\"\n\nCharles was at last able to express his feelings.\n\n\"Yes, Eugenie; my soul would be small indeed if I did not accept. And\nyet,--gift for gift, confidence for confidence.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she said, frightened.\n\n\"Listen, dear cousin; I have here--\" He interrupted himself to point\nout a square box covered with an outer case of leather which was on the\ndrawers. \"There,\" he continued, \"is something as precious to me as\nlife itself. This box was a present from my mother. All day I have been\nthinking that if she could rise from her grave, she would herself sell\nthe gold which her love for me lavished on this dressing-case; but were\nI to do so, the act would seem to me a sacrilege.\" Eugenie pressed\nhis hand as she heard these last words. \"No,\" he added, after a slight\npause, during which a liquid glance of tenderness passed between them,\n\"no, I will neither sell it nor risk its safety on my journey. Dear\nEugenie, you shall be its guardian. Never did friend commit anything\nmore sacred to another. Let me show it to you.\"\n\nHe went to the box, took it from its outer coverings, opened it, and\nshowed his delighted cousin a dressing-case where the rich workmanship\ngave to the gold ornaments a value far above their weight.\n\n\"What you admire there is nothing,\" he said, pushing a secret spring\nwhich opened a hidden drawer. \"Here is something which to me is worth\nthe whole world.\" He drew out two portraits, masterpieces of Madame\nMirbel, richly set with pearls.\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful! Is it the lady to whom you wrote that--\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, smiling; \"this is my mother, and here is my father, your\naunt and uncle. Eugenie, I beg you on my knees, keep my treasure safely.\nIf I die and your little fortune is lost, this gold and these pearls\nwill repay you. To you alone could I leave these portraits; you are\nworthy to keep them. But destroy them at last, so that they may pass\ninto no other hands.\" Eugenie was silent. \"Ah, yes, say yes! You\nconsent?\" he added with winning grace.\n\nHearing the very words she had just used to her cousin now addressed to\nherself, she turned upon him a look of love, her first look of loving\nwomanhood,--a glance in which there is nearly as much of coquetry as of\ninmost depth. He took her hand and kissed it.\n\n\"Angel of purity! between us two money is nothing, never can be\nanything. Feeling, sentiment, must be all henceforth.\"\n\n\"You are like your mother,--was her voice as soft as yours?\"\n\n\"Oh! much softer--\"\n\n\"Yes, for you,\" she said, dropping her eyelids. \"Come, Charles, go to\nbed; I wish it; you must be tired. Good-night.\" She gently disengaged\nher hand from those of her cousin, who followed her to her room,\nlighting the way. When they were both upon the threshold,--\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"why am I ruined?\"\n\n\"What matter?--my father is rich; I think so,\" she answered.\n\n\"Poor child!\" said Charles, making a step into her room and leaning\nhis back against the wall, \"if that were so, he would never have let my\nfather die; he would not let you live in this poor way; he would live\notherwise himself.\"\n\n\"But he owns Froidfond.\"\n\n\"What is Froidfond worth?\"\n\n\"I don't know; but he has Noyers.\"\n\n\"Nothing but a poor farm!\"\n\n\"He has vineyards and fields.\"\n\n\"Mere nothing,\" said Charles disdainfully. \"If your father had only\ntwenty-four thousand francs a year do you suppose you would live in this\ncold, barren room?\" he added, making a step in advance. \"Ah! there you\nwill keep my treasures,\" he said, glancing at the old cabinet, as if to\nhide his thoughts.\n\n\"Go and sleep,\" she said, hindering his entrance into the disordered\nroom.\n\nCharles stepped back, and they bid each other good-night with a mutual\nsmile.\n\nBoth fell asleep in the same dream; and from that moment the youth began\nto wear roses with his mourning. The next day, before breakfast, Madame\nGrandet found her daughter in the garden in company with Charles.\nThe young man was still sad, as became a poor fellow who, plunged in\nmisfortune, measures the depths of the abyss into which he has fallen,\nand sees the terrible burden of his whole future life.\n\n\"My father will not be home till dinner-time,\" said Eugenie, perceiving\nthe anxious look on her mother's face.\n\nIt was easy to trace in the face and manners of the young girl and in\nthe singular sweetness of her voice a unison of thought between her and\nher cousin. Their souls had espoused each other, perhaps before they\neven felt the force of the feelings which bound them together. Charles\nspent the morning in the hall, and his sadness was respected. Each of\nthe three women had occupations of her own. Grandet had left all his\naffairs unattended to, and a number of persons came on business,--the\nplumber, the mason, the slater, the carpenter, the diggers, the\ndressers, the farmers; some to drive a bargain about repairs, others to\npay their rent or to be paid themselves for services. Madame Grandet and\nEugenie were obliged to go and come and listen to the interminable talk\nof all these workmen and country folk. Nanon put away in her kitchen\nthe produce which they brought as tribute. She always waited for her\nmaster's orders before she knew what portion was to be used in the house\nand what was to be sold in the market. It was the goodman's custom, like\nthat of a great many country gentlemen, to drink his bad wine and eat\nhis spoiled fruit.\n\nTowards five in the afternoon Grandet returned from Angers, having made\nfourteen thousand francs by the exchange on his gold, bringing home\nin his wallet good treasury-notes which bore interest until the day he\nshould invest them in the Funds. He had left Cornoiller at Angers to\nlook after the horses, which were well-nigh foundered, with orders to\nbring them home slowly after they were rested.\n\n\"I have got back from Angers, wife,\" he said; \"I am hungry.\"\n\nNanon called out to him from the kitchen: \"Haven't you eaten anything\nsince yesterday?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the old man.\n\nNanon brought in the soup. Des Grassins came to take his client's orders\njust as the family sat down to dinner. Grandet had not even observed his\nnephew.\n\n\"Go on eating, Grandet,\" said the banker; \"we can talk. Do you know what\ngold is worth in Angers? They have come from Nantes after it? I shall\nsend some of ours.\"\n\n\"Don't send any,\" said Grandet; \"they have got enough. We are such old\nfriends, I ought to save you from such a loss of time.\"\n\n\"But gold is worth thirteen francs fifty centimes.\"\n\n\"Say _was_ worth--\"\n\n\"Where the devil have they got any?\"\n\n\"I went to Angers last night,\" answered Grandet in a low voice.\n\nThe banker shook with surprise. Then a whispered conversation began\nbetween the two, during which Grandet and des Grassins frequently\nlooked at Charles. Presently des Grassins gave a start of astonishment;\nprobably Grandet was then instructing him to invest the sum which was to\ngive him a hundred thousand francs a year in the Funds.\n\n\"Monsieur Grandet,\" said the banker to Charles, \"I am starting for\nParis; if you have any commissions--\"\n\n\"None, monsieur, I thank you,\" answered Charles.\n\n\"Thank him better than that, nephew. Monsieur is going to settle the\naffairs of the house of Guillaume Grandet.\"\n\n\"Is there any hope?\" said Charles eagerly.\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed his uncle, with well-acted pride, \"are you not my\nnephew? Your honor is ours. Is not your name Grandet?\"\n\nCharles rose, seized Pere Grandet, kissed him, turned pale, and left the\nroom. Eugenie looked at her father with admiration.\n\n\"Well, good-by, des Grassins; it is all in your hands. Decoy those\npeople as best you can; lead 'em by the nose.\"\n\nThe two diplomatists shook hands. The old cooper accompanied the banker\nto the front door. Then, after closing it, he came back and plunged into\nhis armchair, saying to Nanon,--\n\n\"Get me some black-currant ratafia.\"\n\nToo excited, however, to remain long in one place, he got up, looked\nat the portrait of Monsieur de la Bertelliere, and began to sing, doing\nwhat Nanon called his dancing steps,--\n\n  \"Dans les gardes francaises\n  J'avais un bon papa.\"\n\nNanon, Madame Grandet, and Eugenie looked at each other in silence.\nThe hilarity of the master always frightened them when it reached its\nclimax. The evening was soon over. Pere Grandet chose to go to bed\nearly, and when he went to bed, everybody else was expected to go too;\nlike as when Augustus drank, Poland was drunk. On this occasion Nanon,\nCharles, and Eugenie were not less tired than the master. As for Madame\nGrandet, she slept, ate, drank, and walked according to the will of her\nhusband. However, during the two hours consecrated to digestion, the\ncooper, more facetious than he had ever been in his life, uttered a\nnumber of his own particular apothegms,--a single one of which will give\nthe measure of his mind. When he had drunk his ratafia, he looked at his\nglass and said,--\n\n\"You have no sooner put your lips to a glass than it is empty! Such is\nlife. You can't have and hold. Gold won't circulate and stay in your\npurse. If it were not for that, life would be too fine.\"\n\nHe was jovial and benevolent. When Nanon came with her spinning-wheel,\n\"You must be tired,\" he said; \"put away your hemp.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! then I shall get sleepy,\" she answered.\n\n\"Poor Nanon! Will you have some ratafia?\"\n\n\"I won't refuse a good offer; madame makes it a deal better than the\napothecaries. What they sell is all drugs.\"\n\n\"They put too much sugar,\" said the master; \"you can't taste anything\nelse.\"\n\n\n\n\nIX\n\nThe following day the family, meeting at eight o'clock for the early\nbreakfast, made a picture of genuine domestic intimacy. Grief had\ndrawn Madame Grandet, Eugenie, and Charles _en rapport_; even Nanon\nsympathized, without knowing why. The four now made one family. As to\nthe old man, his satisfied avarice and the certainty of soon getting rid\nof the dandy without having to pay more than his journey to Nantes, made\nhim nearly indifferent to his presence in the house. He left the two\nchildren, as he called Charles and Eugenie, free to conduct themselves\nas they pleased, under the eye of Madame Grandet, in whom he had\nimplicit confidence as to all that concerned public and religious\nmorality. He busied himself in straightening the boundaries of his\nfields and ditches along the high-road, in his poplar-plantations beside\nthe Loire, in the winter work of his vineyards, and at Froidfond. All\nthese things occupied his whole time.\n\nFor Eugenie the springtime of love had come. Since the scene at night\nwhen she gave her little treasure to her cousin, her heart had followed\nthe treasure. Confederates in the same secret, they looked at each\nother with a mutual intelligence which sank to the depth of their\nconsciousness, giving a closer communion, a more intimate relation\nto their feelings, and putting them, so to speak, beyond the pale of\nordinary life. Did not their near relationship warrant the gentleness\nin their tones, the tenderness in their glances? Eugenie took delight\nin lulling her cousin's pain with the pretty childish joys of a new-born\nlove. Are there no sweet similitudes between the birth of love and the\nbirth of life? Do we not rock the babe with gentle songs and softest\nglances? Do we not tell it marvellous tales of the golden future? Hope\nherself, does she not spread her radiant wings above its head? Does it\nnot shed, with infant fickleness, its tears of sorrow and its tears of\njoy? Does it not fret for trifles, cry for the pretty pebbles with which\nto build its shifting palaces, for the flowers forgotten as soon as\nplucked? Is it not eager to grasp the coming time, to spring forward\ninto life? Love is our second transformation. Childhood and love\nwere one and the same thing to Eugenie and to Charles; it was a first\npassion, with all its child-like play,--the more caressing to their\nhearts because they now were wrapped in sadness. Struggling at birth\nagainst the gloom of mourning, their love was only the more in harmony\nwith the provincial plainness of that gray and ruined house. As they\nexchanged a few words beside the well in the silent court, or lingered\nin the garden for the sunset hour, sitting on a mossy seat saying to\neach other the infinite nothings of love, or mused in the silent calm\nwhich reigned between the house and the ramparts like that beneath the\narches of a church, Charles comprehended the sanctity of love; for his\ngreat lady, his dear Annette, had taught him only its stormy troubles.\nAt this moment he left the worldly passion, coquettish, vain, and showy\nas it was, and turned to the true, pure love. He loved even the house,\nwhose customs no longer seemed to him ridiculous. He got up early in the\nmornings that he might talk with Eugenie for a moment before her father\ncame to dole out the provisions; when the steps of the old man sounded\non the staircase he escaped into the garden. The small criminality of\nthis morning _tete-a-tete_ which Nanon pretended not to see, gave to\ntheir innocent love the lively charm of a forbidden joy.\n\nAfter breakfast, when Grandet had gone to his fields and his other\noccupations, Charles remained with the mother and daughter, finding an\nunknown pleasure in holding their skeins, in watching them at work, in\nlistening to their quiet prattle. The simplicity of this half-monastic\nlife, which revealed to him the beauty of these souls, unknown and\nunknowing of the world, touched him keenly. He had believed such morals\nimpossible in France, and admitted their existence nowhere but in\nGermany; even so, they seemed to him fabulous, only real in the novels\nof Auguste Lafontaine. Soon Eugenie became to him the Margaret of\nGoethe--before her fall. Day by day his words, his looks enraptured the\npoor girl, who yielded herself up with delicious non-resistance to\nthe current of love; she caught her happiness as a swimmer seizes the\noverhanging branch of a willow to draw himself from the river and lie at\nrest upon its shore. Did no dread of a coming absence sadden the happy\nhours of those fleeting days? Daily some little circumstance reminded\nthem of the parting that was at hand.\n\nThree days after the departure of des Grassins, Grandet took his nephew\nto the Civil courts, with the solemnity which country people attach to\nall legal acts, that he might sign a deed surrendering his rights in his\nfather's estate. Terrible renunciation! species of domestic apostasy!\nCharles also went before Maitre Cruchot to make two powers of\nattorney,--one for des Grassins, the other for the friend whom he had\ncharged with the sale of his belongings. After that he attended to all\nthe formalities necessary to obtain a passport for foreign countries;\nand finally, when he received his simple mourning clothes from Paris, he\nsent for the tailor of Saumur and sold to him his useless wardrobe. This\nlast act pleased Grandet exceedingly.\n\n\"Ah! now you look like a man prepared to embark and make your fortune,\"\nhe said, when Charles appeared in a surtout of plain black cloth. \"Good!\nvery good!\"\n\n\"I hope you will believe, monsieur,\" answered his nephew, \"that I shall\nalways try to conform to my situation.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" said his uncle, his eyes lighting up at a handful of gold\nwhich Charles was carrying.\n\n\"Monsieur, I have collected all my buttons and rings and other\nsuperfluities which may have some value; but not knowing any one in\nSaumur, I wanted to ask you to--\"\n\n\"To buy them?\" said Grandet, interrupting him.\n\n\"No, uncle; only to tell me of an honest man who--\"\n\n\"Give me those things, I will go upstairs and estimate their value; I\nwill come back and tell you what it is to a fraction. Jeweller's gold,\"\nexamining a long chain, \"eighteen or nineteen carats.\"\n\nThe goodman held out his huge hand and received the mass of gold, which\nhe carried away.\n\n\"Cousin,\" said Grandet, \"may I offer you these two buttons? They can\nfasten ribbons round your wrists; that sort of bracelet is much the\nfashion just now.\"\n\n\"I accept without hesitation,\" she answered, giving him an understanding\nlook.\n\n\"Aunt, here is my mother's thimble; I have always kept it carefully in\nmy dressing-case,\" said Charles, presenting a pretty gold thimble to\nMadame Grandet, who for many years had longed for one.\n\n\"I cannot thank you; no words are possible, my nephew,\" said the poor\nmother, whose eyes filled with tears. \"Night and morning in my prayers I\nshall add one for you, the most earnest of all--for those who travel. If\nI die, Eugenie will keep this treasure for you.\"\n\n\"They are worth nine hundred and eighty-nine francs, seventy-five\ncentimes,\" said Grandet, opening the door. \"To save you the pain of\nselling them, I will advance the money--in _livres_.\"\n\nThe word _livres_ on the littoral of the Loire signifies that crown\nprices of six _livres_ are to be accepted as six francs without\ndeduction.\n\n\"I dared not propose it to you,\" answered Charles; \"but it was most\nrepugnant to me to sell my jewels to some second-hand dealer in your own\ntown. People should wash their dirty linen at home, as Napoleon said. I\nthank you for your kindness.\"\n\nGrandet scratched his ear, and there was a moment's silence.\n\n\"My dear uncle,\" resumed Charles, looking at him with an uneasy air, as\nif he feared to wound his feelings, \"my aunt and cousin have been kind\nenough to accept a trifling remembrance of me. Will you allow me to give\nyou these sleeve-buttons, which are useless to me now? They will remind\nyou of a poor fellow who, far away, will always think of those who are\nhenceforth all his family.\"\n\n\"My lad, my lad, you mustn't rob yourself this way! Let me see, wife,\nwhat have you got?\" he added, turning eagerly to her. \"Ah! a gold\nthimble. And you, little girl? What! diamond buttons? Yes, I'll accept\nyour present, nephew,\" he answered, shaking Charles by the hand.\n\"But--you must let me--pay--your--yes, your passage to the Indies. Yes,\nI wish to pay your passage because--d'ye see, my boy?--in valuing\nyour jewels I estimated only the weight of the gold; very likely the\nworkmanship is worth something. So let us settle it that I am to give\nyou fifteen hundred francs--in _livres_; Cruchot will lend them to me. I\nhaven't got a copper farthing here,--unless Perrotet, who is behindhand\nwith his rent, should pay up. By the bye, I'll go and see him.\"\n\nHe took his hat, put on his gloves, and went out.\n\n\"Then you are really going?\" said Eugenie to her cousin, with a sad\nlook, mingled with admiration.\n\n\"I must,\" he said, bowing his head.\n\nFor some days past, Charles's whole bearing, manners, and speech had\nbecome those of a man who, in spite of his profound affliction, feels\nthe weight of immense obligations and has the strength to gather courage\nfrom misfortune. He no longer repined, he became a man. Eugenie never\naugured better of her cousin's character than when she saw him come\ndown in the plain black clothes which suited well with his pale face and\nsombre countenance. On that day the two women put on their own mourning,\nand all three assisted at a Requiem celebrated in the parish church for\nthe soul of the late Guillaume Grandet.\n\nAt the second breakfast Charles received letters from Paris and began to\nread them.\n\n\"Well, cousin, are you satisfied with the management of your affairs?\"\nsaid Eugenie in a low voice.\n\n\"Never ask such questions, my daughter,\" said Grandet. \"What the devil!\ndo I tell you my affairs? Why do you poke your nose into your cousin's?\nLet the lad alone!\"\n\n\"Oh! I haven't any secrets,\" said Charles.\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta, nephew; you'll soon find out that you must hold your\ntongue in business.\"\n\nWhen the two lovers were alone in the garden, Charles said to Eugenie,\ndrawing her down on the old bench beneath the walnut-tree,--\n\n\"I did right to trust Alphonse; he has done famously. He has managed my\naffairs with prudence and good faith. I now owe nothing in Paris. All my\nthings have been sold; and he tells me that he has taken the advice\nof an old sea-captain and spent three thousand francs on a commercial\noutfit of European curiosities which will be sure to be in demand in the\nIndies. He has sent my trunks to Nantes, where a ship is loading for San\nDomingo. In five days, Eugenie, we must bid each other farewell--perhaps\nforever, at least for years. My outfit and ten thousand francs, which\ntwo of my friends send me, are a very small beginning. I cannot look to\nreturn for many years. My dear cousin, do not weight your life in the\nscales with mine; I may perish; some good marriage may be offered to\nyou--\"\n\n\"Do you love me?\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, yes! indeed, yes!\" he answered, with a depth of tone that revealed\nan equal depth of feeling.\n\n\"I shall wait, Charles--Good heavens! there is my father at his window,\"\nshe said, repulsing her cousin, who leaned forward to kiss her.\n\nShe ran quickly under the archway. Charles followed her. When she\nsaw him, she retreated to the foot of the staircase and opened the\nswing-door; then, scarcely knowing where she was going, Eugenie reached\nthe corner near Nanon's den, in the darkest end of the passage. There\nCharles caught her hand and drew her to his heart. Passing his arm about\nher waist, he made her lean gently upon him. Eugenie no longer resisted;\nshe received and gave the purest, the sweetest, and yet, withal, the\nmost unreserved of kisses.\n\n\"Dear Eugenie, a cousin is better than a brother, for he can marry you,\"\nsaid Charles.\n\n\"So be it!\" cried Nanon, opening the door of her lair.\n\nThe two lovers, alarmed, fled into the hall, where Eugenie took up her\nwork and Charles began to read the litanies of the Virgin in Madame\nGrandet's prayer-book.\n\n\"Mercy!\" cried Nanon, \"now they're saying their prayers.\"\n\nAs soon as Charles announced his immediate departure, Grandet bestirred\nhimself to testify much interest in his nephew. He became very liberal\nof all that cost him nothing; took pains to find a packer; declared the\nman asked too much for his cases; insisted on making them himself out\nof old planks; got up early in the morning to fit and plane and nail\ntogether the strips, out of which he made, to his own satisfaction, some\nstrong cases, in which he packed all Charles's effects; he also took\nupon himself to send them by boat down the Loire, to insure them, and\nget them to Nantes in proper time.\n\nAfter the kiss taken in the passage, the hours fled for Eugenie with\nfrightful rapidity. Sometimes she thought of following her cousin.\nThose who have known that most endearing of all passions,--the one whose\nduration is each day shortened by time, by age, by mortal illness, by\nhuman chances and fatalities,--they will understand the poor girl's\ntortures. She wept as she walked in the garden, now so narrow to her,\nas indeed the court, the house, the town all seemed. She launched in\nthought upon the wide expanse of the ocean he was about to traverse.\nAt last the eve of his departure came. That morning, in the absence\nof Grandet and of Nanon, the precious case which contained the two\nportraits was solemnly installed in the only drawer of the old cabinet\nwhich could be locked, where the now empty velvet purse was lying. This\ndeposit was not made without a goodly number of tears and kisses. When\nEugenie placed the key within her bosom she had no courage to forbid the\nkiss with which Charles sealed the act.\n\n\"It shall never leave that place, my friend,\" she said.\n\n\"Then my heart will be always there.\"\n\n\"Ah! Charles, it is not right,\" she said, as though she blamed him.\n\n\"Are we not married?\" he said. \"I have thy promise,--then take mine.\"\n\n\"Thine; I am thine forever!\" they each said, repeating the words twice\nover.\n\nNo promise made upon this earth was ever purer. The innocent sincerity\nof Eugenie had sanctified for a moment the young man's love.\n\nOn the morrow the breakfast was sad. Nanon herself, in spite of the\ngold-embroidered robe and the Jeannette cross bestowed by Charles, had\ntears in her eyes.\n\n\"The poor dear monsieur who is going on the seas--oh, may God guide\nhim!\"\n\nAt half-past ten the whole family started to escort Charles to the\ndiligence for Nantes. Nanon let loose the dog, locked the door, and\ninsisted on carrying the young man's carpet-bag. All the tradesmen in\nthe tortuous old street were on the sill of their shop-doors to watch\nthe procession, which was joined in the market-place by Maitre Cruchot.\n\n\"Eugenie, be sure you don't cry,\" said her mother.\n\n\"Nephew,\" said Grandet, in the doorway of the inn from which the coach\nstarted, kissing Charles on both cheeks, \"depart poor, return rich;\nyou will find the honor of your father safe. I answer for that myself,\nI--Grandet; for it will only depend on you to--\"\n\n\"Ah! my uncle, you soften the bitterness of my departure. Is it not the\nbest gift that you could make me?\"\n\nNot understanding his uncle's words which he had thus interrupted,\nCharles shed tears of gratitude upon the tanned cheeks of the old miser,\nwhile Eugenie pressed the hand of her cousin and that of her father with\nall her strength. The notary smiled, admiring the sly speech of the old\nman, which he alone had understood. The family stood about the coach\nuntil it started; then as it disappeared upon the bridge, and its rumble\ngrew fainter in the distance, Grandet said:\n\n\"Good-by to you!\"\n\nHappily no one but Maitre Cruchot heard the exclamation. Eugenie and her\nmother had gone to a corner of the quay from which they could still see\nthe diligence and wave their white handkerchiefs, to which Charles made\nanswer by displaying his.\n\n\"Ah! mother, would that I had the power of God for a single moment,\"\nsaid Eugenie, when she could no longer see her lover's handkerchief.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nNot to interrupt the current of events which are about to take place in\nthe bosom of the Grandet family, it is necessary to cast a forestalling\neye upon the various operations which the goodman carried on in Paris\nby means of Monsieur des Grassins. A month after the latter's departure\nfrom Saumur, Grandet, became possessed of a certificate of a hundred\nthousand francs a year from his investment in the Funds, bought\nat eighty francs net. The particulars revealed at his death by the\ninventory of his property threw no light upon the means which his\nsuspicious nature took to remit the price of the investment and receive\nthe certificate thereof. Maitre Cruchot was of opinion that Nanon,\nunknown to herself, was the trusty instrument by which the money was\ntransported; for about this time she was absent five days, under a\npretext of putting things to rights at Froidfond,--as if the goodman\nwere capable of leaving anything lying about or out of order!\n\nIn all that concerned the business of the house of Guillaume Grandet\nthe old cooper's intentions were fulfilled to the letter. The Bank of\nFrance, as everybody knows, affords exact information about all the\nlarge fortunes in Paris and the provinces. The names of des Grassins\nand Felix Grandet of Saumur were well known there, and they enjoyed the\nesteem bestowed on financial celebrities whose wealth comes from immense\nand unencumbered territorial possessions. The arrival of the Saumur\nbanker for the purpose, it was said, of honorably liquidating the\naffairs of Grandet of Paris, was enough to avert the shame of protested\nnotes from the memory of the defunct merchant. The seals on the property\nwere taken off in presence of the creditors, and the notary employed by\nGrandet went to work at once on the inventory of the assets. Soon after\nthis, des Grassins called a meeting of the creditors, who unanimously\nelected him, conjointly with Francois Keller, the head of a rich\nbanking-house and one of those principally interested in the affair, as\nliquidators, with full power to protect both the honor of the family\nand the interests of the claimants. The credit of Grandet of Saumur,\nthe hopes he diffused by means of des Grassins in the minds of all\nconcerned, facilitated the transactions. Not a single creditor proved\nrecalcitrant; no one thought of passing his claim to his profit-and-loss\naccount; each and all said confidently, \"Grandet of Saumur will pay.\"\n\nSix months went by. The Parisians had redeemed the notes in circulation\nas they fell due, and held them under lock and key in their desks. First\nresult aimed at by the old cooper! Nine months after this preliminary\nmeeting, the two liquidators distributed forty-seven per cent to each\ncreditor on his claim. This amount was obtained by the sale of the\nsecurities, property, and possessions of all kinds belonging to the\nlate Guillaume Grandet, and was paid over with scrupulous fidelity.\nUnimpeachable integrity was shown in the transaction. The creditors\ngratefully acknowledged the remarkable and incontestable honor displayed\nby the Grandets. When these praises had circulated for a certain length\nof time, the creditors asked for the rest of their money. It became\nnecessary to write a collective letter to Grandet of Saumur.\n\n\"Here it comes!\" said the old man as he threw the letter into the fire.\n\"Patience, my good friends!\"\n\nIn answer to the proposals contained in the letter, Grandet of Saumur\ndemanded that all vouchers for claims against the estate of his brother\nshould be deposited with a notary, together with acquittances for the\nforty-seven per cent already paid; he made this demand under pretence of\nsifting the accounts and finding out the exact condition of the estate.\nIt roused at once a variety of difficulties. Generally speaking, the\ncreditor is a species of maniac, ready to agree to anything one day, on\nthe next breathing fire and slaughter; later on, he grows amicable and\neasy-going. To-day his wife is good-humored, his last baby has cut its\nfirst tooth, all is well at home, and he is determined not to lose a\nsou; on the morrow it rains, he can't go out, he is gloomy, he says yes\nto any proposal that is made to him, so long as it will put an end to\nthe affair; on the third day he declares he must have guarantees; by\nthe end of the month he wants his debtor's head, and becomes at heart an\nexecutioner. The creditor is a good deal like the sparrow on whose tail\nconfiding children are invited to put salt,--with this difference, that\nhe applies the image to his claim, the proceeds of which he is never\nable to lay hold of. Grandet had studied the atmospheric variations\nof creditors, and the creditors of his brother justified all his\ncalculations. Some were angry, and flatly refused to give in their\nvouchers.\n\n\"Very good; so much the better,\" said Grandet, rubbing his hands over\nthe letter in which des Grassins announced the fact.\n\nOthers agreed to the demand, but only on condition that their rights\nshould be fully guaranteed; they renounced none, and even reserved\nthe power of ultimately compelling a failure. On this began a long\ncorrespondence, which ended in Grandet of Saumur agreeing to all\nconditions. By means of this concession the placable creditors were\nable to bring the dissatisfied creditors to reason. The deposit was then\nmade, but not without sundry complaints.\n\n\"Your goodman,\" they said to des Grassins, \"is tricking us.\"\n\nTwenty-three months after the death of Guillaume Grandet many of the\ncreditors, carried away by more pressing business in the markets of\nParis, had forgotten their Grandet claims, or only thought of them to\nsay:\n\n\"I begin to believe that forty-seven per cent is all I shall ever get\nout of that affair.\"\n\nThe old cooper had calculated on the power of time, which, as he used to\nsay, is a pretty good devil after all. By the end of the third year des\nGrassins wrote to Grandet that he had brought the creditors to agree to\ngive up their claims for ten per cent on the two million four hundred\nthousand francs still due by the house of Grandet. Grandet answered that\nthe notary and the broker whose shameful failures had caused the death\nof his brother were still living, that they might now have recovered\ntheir credit, and that they ought to be sued, so as to get something out\nof them towards lessening the total of the deficit.\n\nBy the end of the fourth year the liabilities were definitely estimated\nat a sum of twelve hundred thousand francs. Many negotiations, lasting\nover six months, took place between the creditors and the liquidators,\nand between the liquidators and Grandet. To make a long story short,\nGrandet of Saumur, anxious by this time to get out of the affair, told\nthe liquidators, about the ninth month of the fourth year, that his\nnephew had made a fortune in the Indies and was disposed to pay his\nfather's debts in full; he therefore could not take upon himself to make\nany settlement without previously consulting him; he had written to him,\nand was expecting an answer. The creditors were held in check until the\nmiddle of the fifth year by the words, \"payment in full,\" which the wily\nold miser threw out from time to time as he laughed in his beard, saying\nwith a smile and an oath, \"Those Parisians!\"\n\nBut the creditors were reserved for a fate unexampled in the annals\nof commerce. When the events of this history bring them once more into\nnotice, they will be found still in the position Grandet had resolved to\nforce them into from the first.\n\nAs soon as the Funds reached a hundred and fifteen, Pere Grandet sold\nout his interests and withdrew two million four hundred thousand francs\nin gold, to which he added, in his coffers, the six hundred thousand\nfrancs compound interest which he had derived from the capital. Des\nGrassins now lived in Paris. In the first place he had been made a\ndeputy; then he became infatuated (father of a family as he was, though\nhorribly bored by the provincial life of Saumur) with a pretty actress\nat the Theatre de Madame, known as Florine, and he presently relapsed\ninto the old habits of his army life. It is useless to speak of his\nconduct; Saumur considered it profoundly immoral. His wife was fortunate\nin the fact of her property being settled upon herself, and in having\nsufficient ability to keep up the banking-house in Saumur, which was\nmanaged in her name and repaired the breach in her fortune caused by the\nextravagance of her husband. The Cruchotines made so much talk about\nthe false position of the quasi-widow that she married her daughter very\nbadly, and was forced to give up all hope of an alliance between Eugenie\nGrandet and her son. Adolphe joined his father in Paris and became, it\nwas said, a worthless fellow. The Cruchots triumphed.\n\n\"Your husband hasn't common sense,\" said Grandet as he lent Madame des\nGrassins some money on a note securely endorsed. \"I am very sorry for\nyou, for you are a good little woman.\"\n\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" said the poor lady, \"who could have believed that when\nhe left Saumur to go to Paris on your business he was going to his\nruin?\"\n\n\"Heaven is my witness, madame, that up to the last moment I did all I\ncould to prevent him from going. Monsieur le president was most anxious\nto take his place; but he was determined to go, and now we all see why.\"\n\nIn this way Grandet made it quite plain that he was under no obligation\nto des Grassins.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nIn all situations women have more cause for suffering than men, and they\nsuffer more. Man has strength and the power of exercising it; he acts,\nmoves, thinks, occupies himself; he looks ahead, and sees consolation in\nthe future. It was thus with Charles. But the woman stays at home; she\nis always face to face with the grief from which nothing distracts\nher; she goes down to the depths of the abyss which yawns before her,\nmeasures it, and often fills it with her tears and prayers. Thus did\nEugenie. She initiated herself into her destiny. To feel, to love, to\nsuffer, to devote herself,--is not this the sum of woman's life? Eugenie\nwas to be in all things a woman, except in the one thing that consoles\nfor all. Her happiness, picked up like nails scattered on a wall--to use\nthe fine simile of Bossuet--would never so much as fill even the hollow\nof her hand. Sorrows are never long in coming; for her they came soon.\nThe day after Charles's departure the house of Monsieur Grandet resumed\nits ordinary aspect in the eyes of all, except in those of Eugenie, to\nwhom it grew suddenly empty. She wished, if it could be done unknown to\nher father, that Charles's room might be kept as he had left it. Madame\nGrandet and Nanon were willing accomplices in this _statu quo_.\n\n\"Who knows but he may come back sooner than we think for?\" she said.\n\n\"Ah, don't I wish I could see him back!\" answered Nanon. \"I took to him!\nHe was such a dear, sweet young man,--pretty too, with his curly hair.\"\nEugenie looked at Nanon. \"Holy Virgin! don't look at me that way,\nmademoiselle; your eyes are like those of a lost soul.\"\n\nFrom that day the beauty of Mademoiselle Grandet took a new character.\nThe solemn thoughts of love which slowly filled her soul, and the\ndignity of the woman beloved, gave to her features an illumination such\nas painters render by a halo. Before the coming of her cousin, Eugenie\nmight be compared to the Virgin before the conception; after he had\ngone, she was like the Virgin Mother,--she had given birth to love.\nThese two Marys so different, so well represented by Spanish art, embody\none of those shining symbols with which Christianity abounds.\n\nReturning from Mass on the morning after Charles's departure,--having\nmade a vow to hear it daily,--Eugenie bought a map of the world, which\nshe nailed up beside her looking-glass, that she might follow her cousin\non his westward way, that she might put herself, were it ever so little,\nday by day into the ship that bore him, and see him and ask him a\nthousand questions,--\"Art thou well? Dost thou suffer? Dost thou think\nof me when the star, whose beauty and usefulness thou hast taught me\nto know, shines upon thee?\" In the mornings she sat pensive beneath the\nwalnut-tree, on the worm-eaten bench covered with gray lichens, where\nthey had said to each other so many precious things, so many trifles,\nwhere they had built the pretty castles of their future home. She\nthought of the future now as she looked upward to the bit of sky which\nwas all the high walls suffered her to see; then she turned her eyes\nto the angle where the sun crept on, and to the roof above the room in\nwhich he had slept. Hers was the solitary love, the persistent love,\nwhich glides into every thought and becomes the substance, or, as our\nfathers might have said, the tissue of life. When the would-be friends\nof Pere Grandet came in the evening for their game at cards, she was gay\nand dissimulating; but all the morning she talked of Charles with her\nmother and Nanon. Nanon had brought herself to see that she could pity\nthe sufferings of her young mistress without failing in her duty to the\nold master, and she would say to Eugenie,--\n\n\"If I had a man for myself I'd--I'd follow him to hell, yes, I'd\nexterminate myself for him; but I've none. I shall die and never know\nwhat life is. Would you believe, mamz'elle, that old Cornoiller (a good\nfellow all the same) is always round my petticoats for the sake of my\nmoney,--just for all the world like the rats who come smelling after the\nmaster's cheese and paying court to you? I see it all; I've got a shrewd\neye, though I am as big as a steeple. Well, mamz'elle, it pleases me,\nbut it isn't love.\"\n\n\n\n\nX\n\nTwo months went by. This domestic life, once so monotonous, was now\nquickened with the intense interest of a secret that bound these women\nintimately together. For them Charles lived and moved beneath the\ngrim gray rafters of the hall. Night and morning Eugenie opened the\ndressing-case and gazed at the portrait of her aunt. One Sunday morning\nher mother surprised her as she stood absorbed in finding her cousin's\nfeatures in his mother's face. Madame Grandet was then for the first\ntime admitted into the terrible secret of the exchange made by Charles\nagainst her daughter's treasure.\n\n\"You gave him all!\" cried the poor mother, terrified. \"What will you say\nto your father on New Year's Day when he asks to see your gold?\"\n\nEugenie's eyes grew fixed, and the two women lived through mortal terror\nfor more than half the morning. They were so troubled in mind that they\nmissed high Mass, and only went to the military service. In three days\nthe year 1819 would come to an end. In three days a terrible drama would\nbegin, a bourgeois tragedy, without poison, or dagger, or the spilling\nof blood; but--as regards the actors in it--more cruel than all the\nfabled horrors in the family of the Atrides.\n\n\"What will become of us?\" said Madame Grandet to her daughter, letting\nher knitting fall upon her knees.\n\nThe poor mother had gone through such anxiety for the past two months\nthat the woollen sleeves which she needed for the coming winter were not\nyet finished. This domestic fact, insignificant as it seems, bore sad\nresults. For want of those sleeves, a chill seized her in the midst of\na sweat caused by a terrible explosion of anger on the part of her\nhusband.\n\n\"I have been thinking, my poor child, that if you had confided your\nsecret to me we should have had time to write to Monsieur des Grassins\nin Paris. He might have sent us gold pieces like yours; though Grandet\nknows them all, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Where could we have got the money?\"\n\n\"I would have pledged my own property. Besides, Monsieur des Grassins\nwould have--\"\n\n\"It is too late,\" said Eugenie in a broken, hollow voice. \"To-morrow\nmorning we must go and wish him a happy New Year in his chamber.\"\n\n\"But, my daughter, why should I not consult the Cruchots?\"\n\n\"No, no; it would be delivering me up to them, and putting ourselves\nin their power. Besides, I have chosen my course. I have done right, I\nrepent of nothing. God will protect me. His will be done! Ah! mother, if\nyou had read his letter, you, too, would have thought only of him.\"\n\nThe next morning, January 1, 1820, the horrible fear to which mother and\ndaughter were a prey suggested to their minds a natural excuse by which\nto escape the solemn entrance into Grandet's chamber. The winter of\n1819-1820 was one of the coldest of that epoch. The snow encumbered the\nroofs.\n\nMadame Grandet called to her husband as soon as she heard him stirring\nin his chamber, and said,--\n\n\"Grandet, will you let Nanon light a fire here for me? The cold is so\nsharp that I am freezing under the bedclothes. At my age I need some\ncomforts. Besides,\" she added, after a slight pause, \"Eugenie shall come\nand dress here; the poor child might get an illness from dressing in her\ncold room in such weather. Then we will go and wish you a happy New Year\nbeside the fire in the hall.\"\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta, what a tongue! a pretty way to begin the new year,\nMadame Grandet! You never talked so much before; but you haven't been\nsopping your bread in wine, I know that.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Well,\" resumed the goodman, who no doubt had some reason of his own for\nagreeing to his wife's request, \"I'll do what you ask, Madame Grandet.\nYou are a good woman, and I don't want any harm to happen to you at your\ntime of life,--though as a general thing the Bertellieres are as sound\nas a roach. Hein! isn't that so?\" he added after a pause. \"Well, I\nforgive them; we got their property in the end.\" And he coughed.\n\n\"You are very gay this morning, monsieur,\" said the poor woman gravely.\n\n\"I'm always gay,--\n\n  \"'Gai, gai, gai, le tonnelier,\n  Raccommodez votre cuvier!'\"\n\nhe answered, entering his wife's room fully dressed. \"Yes, on my word,\nit is cold enough to freeze you solid. We shall have a fine breakfast,\nwife. Des Grassins has sent me a pate-de-foie-gras truffled! I am going\nnow to get it at the coach-office. There'll be a double napoleon for\nEugenie in the package,\" he whispered in Madame Grandet's ear. \"I have\nno gold left, wife. I had a few stray pieces--I don't mind telling you\nthat--but I had to let them go in business.\"\n\nThen, by way of celebrating the new year, he kissed her on the forehead.\n\n\"Eugenie,\" cried the mother, when Grandet was fairly gone, \"I don't know\nwhich side of the bed your father got out of, but he is good-tempered\nthis morning. Perhaps we shall come out safe after all?\"\n\n\"What's happened to the master?\" said Nanon, entering her mistress's\nroom to light the fire. \"First place, he said, 'Good-morning; happy New\nYear, you big fool! Go and light my wife's fire, she's cold'; and then,\ndidn't I feel silly when he held out his hand and gave me a six-franc\npiece, which isn't worn one bit? Just look at it, madame! Oh, the kind\nman! He is a good man, that's a fact. There are some people who the\nolder they get the harder they grow; but he,--why he's getting soft and\nimproving with time, like your ratafia! He is a good, good man--\"\n\nThe secret of Grandet's joy lay in the complete success of his\nspeculation. Monsieur des Grassins, after deducting the amount which\nthe old cooper owed him for the discount on a hundred and fifty thousand\nfrancs in Dutch notes, and for the surplus which he had advanced to make\nup the sum required for the investment in the Funds which was to produce\na hundred thousand francs a year, had now sent him, by the diligence,\nthirty thousand francs in silver coin, the remainder of his first\nhalf-year's interest, informing him at the same time that the Funds\nhad already gone up in value. They were then quoted at eighty-nine;\nthe shrewdest capitalists bought in, towards the last of January, at\nninety-three. Grandet had thus gained in two months twelve per cent on\nhis capital; he had simplified his accounts, and would in future receive\nfifty thousand francs interest every six months, without incurring any\ntaxes or costs for repairs. He understood at last what it was to invest\nmoney in the public securities,--a system for which provincials have\nalways shown a marked repugnance,--and at the end of five years he found\nhimself master of a capital of six millions, which increased without\nmuch effort of his own, and which, joined to the value and proceeds\nof his territorial possessions, gave him a fortune that was absolutely\ncolossal. The six francs bestowed on Nanon were perhaps the reward of\nsome great service which the poor servant had rendered to her master\nunawares.\n\n\"Oh! oh! where's Pere Grandet going? He has been scurrying about since\nsunrise as if to a fire,\" said the tradespeople to each other as they\nopened their shops for the day.\n\nWhen they saw him coming back from the wharf, followed by a porter from\nthe coach-office wheeling a barrow which was laden with sacks, they all\nhad their comments to make:--\n\n\"Water flows to the river; the old fellow was running after his gold,\"\nsaid one.\n\n\"He gets it from Paris and Froidfond and Holland,\" said another.\n\n\"He'll end by buying up Saumur,\" cried a third.\n\n\"He doesn't mind the cold, he's so wrapped up in his gains,\" said a wife\nto her husband.\n\n\"Hey! hey! Monsieur Grandet, if that's too heavy for you,\" said a\ncloth-dealer, his nearest neighbor, \"I'll take it off your hands.\"\n\n\"Heavy?\" said the cooper, \"I should think so; it's all sous!\"\n\n\"Silver sous,\" said the porter in a low voice.\n\n\"If you want me to take care of you, keep your tongue between your\nteeth,\" said the goodman to the porter as they reached the door.\n\n\"The old fox! I thought he was deaf; seems he can hear fast enough in\nfrosty weather.\"\n\n\"Here's twenty sous for your New Year, and _mum_!\" said Grandet. \"Be off\nwith you! Nanon shall take back your barrow. Nanon, are the linnets at\nchurch?\"\n\n\"Yes, monsieur.\"\n\n\"Then lend a hand! go to work!\" he cried, piling the sacks upon her.\nIn a few moments all were carried up to his inner room, where he shut\nhimself in with them. \"When breakfast is ready, knock on the wall,\" he\nsaid as he disappeared. \"Take the barrow back to the coach-office.\"\n\nThe family did not breakfast that day until ten o'clock.\n\n\"Your father will not ask to see your gold downstairs,\" said Madame\nGrandet as they got back from Mass. \"You must pretend to be very chilly.\nWe may have time to replace the treasure before your fete-day.\"\n\nGrandet came down the staircase thinking of his splendid speculation\nin government securities, and wondering how he could metamorphose his\nParisian silver into solid gold; he was making up his mind to invest in\nthis way everything he could lay hands on until the Funds should reach\na par value. Fatal reverie for Eugenie! As soon as he came in, the two\nwomen wished him a happy New Year,--his daughter by putting her arms\nround his neck and caressing him; Madame Grandet gravely and with\ndignity.\n\n\"Ha! ha! my child,\" he said, kissing his daughter on both cheeks. \"I\nwork for you, don't you see? I think of your happiness. Must have money\nto be happy. Without money there's not a particle of happiness. Here!\nthere's a new napoleon for you. I sent to Paris for it. On my word of\nhonor, it's all the gold I have; you are the only one that has got any\ngold. I want to see your gold, little one.\"\n\n\"Oh! it is too cold; let us have breakfast,\" answered Eugenie.\n\n\"Well, after breakfast, then; it will help the digestion. That fat des\nGrassins sent me the pate. Eat as much as you like, my children, it\ncosts nothing. Des Grassins is getting along very well. I am satisfied\nwith him. The old fish is doing Charles a good service, and gratis too.\nHe is making a very good settlement of that poor deceased Grandet's\nbusiness. Hoo! hoo!\" he muttered, with his mouth full, after a pause,\n\"how good it is! Eat some, wife; that will feed you for at least two\ndays.\"\n\n\"I am not hungry. I am very poorly; you know that.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! you can stuff yourself as full as you please without danger,\nyou're a Bertelliere; they are all hearty. You are a bit yellow, that's\ntrue; but I like yellow, myself.\"\n\nThe expectation of ignominious and public death is perhaps less horrible\nto a condemned criminal than the anticipation of what was coming after\nbreakfast to Madame Grandet and Eugenie. The more gleefully the old man\ntalked and ate, the more their hearts shrank within them. The daughter,\nhowever, had an inward prop at this crisis,--she gathered strength\nthrough love.\n\n\"For him! for him!\" she cried within her, \"I would die a thousand\ndeaths.\"\n\nAt this thought, she shot a glance at her mother which flamed with\ncourage.\n\n\"Clear away,\" said Grandet to Nanon when, about eleven o'clock,\nbreakfast was over, \"but leave the table. We can spread your little\ntreasure upon it,\" he said, looking at Eugenie. \"Little? Faith! no; it\nisn't little. You possess, in actual value, five thousand nine hundred\nand fifty-nine francs and the forty I gave you just now. That makes six\nthousand francs, less one. Well, now see here, little one! I'll give you\nthat one franc to make up the round number. Hey! what are you listening\nfor, Nanon? Mind your own business; go and do your work.\"\n\nNanon disappeared.\n\n\"Now listen, Eugenie; you must give me back your gold. You won't refuse\nyour father, my little girl, hein?\"\n\nThe two women were dumb.\n\n\"I have no gold myself. I had some, but it is all gone. I'll give you\nin return six thousand francs in _livres_, and you are to put them just\nwhere I tell you. You mustn't think anything more about your 'dozen.'\nWhen I marry you (which will be soon) I shall get you a husband who can\ngive you the finest 'dozen' ever seen in the provinces. Now attend to\nme, little girl. There's a fine chance for you; you can put your six\nthousand francs into government funds, and you will receive every six\nmonths nearly two hundred francs interest, without taxes, or repairs,\nor frost, or hail, or floods, or anything else to swallow up the money.\nPerhaps you don't like to part with your gold, hey, my girl? Never mind,\nbring it to me all the same. I'll get you some more like it,--like\nthose Dutch coins and the _portugaises_, the rupees of Mogul, and the\n_genovines_,--I'll give you some more on your fete-days, and in three\nyears you'll have got back half your little treasure. What's that you\nsay? Look up, now. Come, go and get it, the precious metal. You ought to\nkiss me on the eyelids for telling you the secrets and the mysteries of\nthe life and death of money. Yes, silver and gold live and swarm like\nmen; they come, and go, and sweat, and multiply--\"\n\nEugenie rose; but after making a few steps towards the door she turned\nabruptly, looked her father in the face, and said,--\n\n\"I have not got _my_ gold.\"\n\n\"You have not got your gold!\" cried Grandet, starting up erect, like a\nhorse that hears a cannon fired beside him.\n\n\"No, I have not got it.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, Eugenie.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"By the shears of my father!\"\n\nWhenever the old man swore that oath the rafters trembled.\n\n\"Holy Virgin! Madame is turning pale,\" cried Nanon.\n\n\"Grandet, your anger will kill me,\" said the poor mother.\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta! nonsense; you never die in your family! Eugenie, what\nhave you done with your gold?\" he cried, rushing upon her.\n\n\"Monsieur,\" said the daughter, falling at Madame Grandet's knees, \"my\nmother is ill. Look at her; do not kill her.\"\n\nGrandet was frightened by the pallor which overspread his wife's face,\nusually so yellow.\n\n\"Nanon, help me to bed,\" said the poor woman in a feeble voice; \"I am\ndying--\"\n\nNanon gave her mistress an arm, Eugenie gave her another; but it was\nonly with infinite difficulty that they could get her upstairs, she fell\nwith exhaustion at every step. Grandet remained alone. However, in a few\nmoments he went up six or eight stairs and called out,--\n\n\"Eugenie, when your mother is in bed, come down.\"\n\n\"Yes, father.\"\n\nShe soon came, after reassuring her mother.\n\n\"My daughter,\" said Grandet, \"you will now tell me what you have done\nwith your gold.\"\n\n\"My father, if you make me presents of which I am not the sole mistress,\ntake them back,\" she answered coldly, picking up the napoleon from the\nchimney-piece and offering it to him.\n\nGrandet seized the coin and slipped it into his breeches' pocket.\n\n\"I shall certainly never give you anything again. Not so much as that!\"\nhe said, clicking his thumb-nail against a front tooth. \"Do you dare to\ndespise your father? have you no confidence in him? Don't you know what\na father is? If he is nothing for you, he is nothing at all. Where is\nyour gold?\"\n\n\"Father, I love and respect you, in spite of your anger; but I humbly\nask you to remember that I am twenty-three years old. You have told me\noften that I have attained my majority, and I do not forget it. I have\nused my money as I chose to use it, and you may be sure that it was put\nto a good use--\"\n\n\"What use?\"\n\n\"That is an inviolable secret,\" she answered. \"Have you no secrets?\"\n\n\"I am the head of the family; I have my own affairs.\"\n\n\"And this is mine.\"\n\n\"It must be something bad if you can't tell it to your father,\nMademoiselle Grandet.\"\n\n\"It is good, and I cannot tell it to my father.\"\n\n\"At least you can tell me when you parted with your gold?\"\n\nEugenie made a negative motion with her head.\n\n\"You had it on your birthday, hein?\"\n\nShe grew as crafty through love as her father was through avarice, and\nreiterated the negative sign.\n\n\"Was there ever such obstinacy! It's a theft,\" cried Grandet, his voice\ngoing up in a crescendo which gradually echoed through the house.\n\"What! here, in my own home, under my very eyes, somebody has taken your\ngold!--the only gold we have!--and I'm not to know who has got it! Gold\nis a precious thing. Virtuous girls go wrong sometimes, and give--I\ndon't know what; they do it among the great people, and even among the\nbourgeoisie. But give their gold!--for you have given it to some one,\nhein?--\"\n\nEugenie was silent and impassive.\n\n\"Was there ever such a daughter? Is it possible that I am your father?\nIf you have invested it anywhere, you must have a receipt--\"\n\n\"Was I free--yes or no--to do what I would with my own? Was it not\nmine?\"\n\n\"You are a child.\"\n\n\"Of age.\"\n\nDumbfounded by his daughter's logic, Grandet turned pale and stamped and\nswore. When at last he found words, he cried: \"Serpent! Cursed girl! Ah,\ndeceitful creature! You know I love you, and you take advantage of it.\nShe'd cut her father's throat! Good God! you've given our fortune to\nthat ne'er-do-well,--that dandy with morocco boots! By the shears of my\nfather! I can't disinherit you, but I curse you,--you and your cousin\nand your children! Nothing good will come of it! Do you hear? If it was\nto Charles--but, no; it's impossible. What! has that wretched fellow\nrobbed me?--\"\n\nHe looked at his daughter, who continued cold and silent.\n\n\"She won't stir; she won't flinch! She's more Grandet than I'm Grandet!\nHa! you have not given your gold for nothing? Come, speak the truth!\"\n\nEugenie looked at her father with a sarcastic expression that stung him.\n\n\"Eugenie, you are here, in my house,--in your father's house. If you\nwish to stay here, you must submit yourself to me. The priests tell you\nto obey me.\" Eugenie bowed her head. \"You affront me in all I hold most\ndear. I will not see you again until you submit. Go to your chamber. You\nwill stay there till I give you permission to leave it. Nanon will bring\nyou bread and water. You hear me--go!\"\n\nEugenie burst into tears and fled up to her mother. Grandet, after\nmarching two or three times round the garden in the snow without heeding\nthe cold, suddenly suspected that his daughter had gone to her mother;\nonly too happy to find her disobedient to his orders, he climbed the\nstairs with the agility of a cat and appeared in Madame Grandet's room\njust as she was stroking Eugenie's hair, while the girl's face was\nhidden in her motherly bosom.\n\n\"Be comforted, my poor child,\" she was saying; \"your father will get\nover it.\"\n\n\"She has no father!\" said the old man. \"Can it be you and I, Madame\nGrandet, who have given birth to such a disobedient child? A fine\neducation,--religious, too! Well! why are you not in your chamber? Come,\nto prison, to prison, mademoiselle!\"\n\n\"Would you deprive me of my daughter, monsieur?\" said Madame Grandet,\nturning towards him a face that was now red with fever.\n\n\"If you want to keep her, carry her off! Clear out--out of my house,\nboth of you! Thunder! where is the gold? what's become of the gold?\"\n\nEugenie rose, looked proudly at her father, and withdrew to her room.\nGrandet turned the key of the door.\n\n\"Nanon,\" he cried, \"put out the fire in the hall.\"\n\nThen he sat down in an armchair beside his wife's fire and said to\nher,--\n\n\"Undoubtedly she has given the gold to that miserable seducer, Charles,\nwho only wanted our money.\"\n\n\"I knew nothing about it,\" she answered, turning to the other side of\nthe bed, that she might escape the savage glances of her husband. \"I\nsuffer so much from your violence that I shall never leave this room, if\nI trust my own presentiments, till I am carried out of it in my coffin.\nYou ought to have spared me this suffering, monsieur,--you, to whom I\nhave caused no pain; that is, I think so. Your daughter loves you.\nI believe her to be as innocent as the babe unborn. Do not make her\nwretched. Revoke your sentence. The cold is very severe; you may give\nher some serious illness.\"\n\n\"I will not see her, neither will I speak to her. She shall stay in\nher room, on bread and water, until she submits to her father. What the\ndevil! shouldn't a father know where the gold in his house has gone to?\nShe owned the only rupees in France, perhaps, and the Dutch ducats and\nthe _genovines_--\"\n\n\"Monsieur, Eugenie is our only child; and even if she had thrown them\ninto the water--\"\n\n\"Into the water!\" cried her husband; \"into the water! You are crazy,\nMadame Grandet! What I have said is said; you know that well enough. If\nyou want peace in this household, make your daughter confess, pump it\nout of her. Women understand how to do that better than we do. Whatever\nshe has done, I sha'n't eat her. Is she afraid of me? Even if she has\nplastered Charles with gold from head to foot, he is on the high seas,\nand nobody can get at him, hein!\"\n\n\"But, monsieur--\" Excited by the nervous crisis through which she had\npassed, and by the fate of her daughter, which brought forth all her\ntenderness and all her powers of mind, Madame Grandet suddenly observed\na frightful movement of her husband's wen, and, in the very act of\nreplying, she changed her speech without changing the tones of her\nvoice,--\"But, monsieur, I have not more influence over her than you\nhave. She has said nothing to me; she takes after you.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut! Your tongue is hung in the middle this morning. Ta, ta, ta,\nta! You are setting me at defiance, I do believe. I daresay you are in\nleague with her.\"\n\nHe looked fixedly at his wife.\n\n\"Monsieur Grandet, if you wish to kill me, you have only to go on like\nthis. I tell you, monsieur,--and if it were to cost me my life, I would\nsay it,--you do wrong by your daughter; she is more in the right than\nyou are. That money belonged to her; she is incapable of making any but\na good use of it, and God alone has the right to know our good deeds.\nMonsieur, I implore you, take Eugenie back into favor; forgive her.\nIf you will do this you will lessen the injury your anger has done me;\nperhaps you will save my life. My daughter! oh, monsieur, give me back\nmy daughter!\"\n\n\"I shall decamp,\" he said; \"the house is not habitable. A mother and\ndaughter talking and arguing like that! Broooouh! Pouah! A fine New\nYear's present you've made me, Eugenie,\" he called out. \"Yes, yes, cry\naway! What you've done will bring you remorse, do you hear? What's the\ngood of taking the sacrament six times every three months, if you give\naway your father's gold secretly to an idle fellow who'll eat your heart\nout when you've nothing else to give him? You'll find out some day what\nyour Charles is worth, with his morocco boots and supercilious airs. He\nhas got neither heart nor soul if he dared to carry off a young girl's\ntreasure without the consent of her parents.\"\n\nWhen the street-door was shut, Eugenie came out of her room and went to\nher mother.\n\n\"What courage you have had for your daughter's sake!\" she said.\n\n\"Ah! my child, see where forbidden things may lead us. You forced me to\ntell a lie.\"\n\n\"I will ask God to punish only me.\"\n\n\"Is it true,\" cried Nanon, rushing in alarmed, \"that mademoiselle is to\nbe kept on bread and water for the rest of her life?\"\n\n\"What does that signify, Nanon?\" said Eugenie tranquilly.\n\n\"Goodness! do you suppose I'll eat _frippe_ when the daughter of the\nhouse is eating dry bread? No, no!\"\n\n\"Don't say a word about all this, Nanon,\" said Eugenie.\n\n\"I'll be as mute as a fish; but you'll see!\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nGrandet dined alone for the first time in twenty-four years.\n\n\"So you're a widower, monsieur,\" said Nanon; \"it must be disagreeable to\nbe a widower with two women in the house.\"\n\n\"I did not speak to you. Hold your jaw, or I'll turn you off! What is\nthat I hear boiling in your saucepan on the stove?\"\n\n\"It is grease I'm trying out.\"\n\n\"There will be some company to-night. Light the fire.\"\n\nThe Cruchots, Madame des Grassins, and her son arrived at the usual\nhour of eight, and were surprised to see neither Madame Grandet nor her\ndaughter.\n\n\"My wife is not very well, and Eugenie is with her,\" said the old\nwine-grower, whose face betrayed no emotion.\n\nAt the end of an hour spent in idle conversation, Madame des Grassins,\nwho had gone up to see Madame Grandet, came down, and every one\ninquired,--\n\n\"How is Madame Grandet?\"\n\n\"Not at all well,\" she answered; \"her condition seems to me really\nalarming. At her age you ought to take every precaution, Papa Grandet.\"\n\n\"We'll see about it,\" said the old man in an absent way.\n\nThey all wished him good-night. When the Cruchots got into the street\nMadame des Grassins said to them,--\n\n\"There is something going on at the Grandets. The mother is very ill\nwithout her knowing it. The girl's eyes are red, as if she had been\ncrying all day. Can they be trying to marry her against her will?\"\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nWhen Grandet had gone to bed Nanon came softly to Eugenie's room in her\nstockinged feet and showed her a pate baked in a saucepan.\n\n\"See, mademoiselle,\" said the good soul, \"Cornoiller gave me a hare. You\neat so little that this pate will last you full a week; in such frosty\nweather it won't spoil. You sha'n't live on dry bread, I'm determined;\nit isn't wholesome.\"\n\n\"Poor Nanon!\" said Eugenie, pressing her hand.\n\n\"I've made it downright good and dainty, and _he_ never found it out. I\nbought the lard and the spices out of my six francs: I'm the mistress of\nmy own money\"; and she disappeared rapidly, fancying she heard Grandet.\n\n\n\n\nXI\n\nFor several months the old wine-grower came constantly to his wife's\nroom at all hours of the day, without ever uttering his daughter's name,\nor seeing her, or making the smallest allusion to her. Madame Grandet\ndid not leave her chamber, and daily grew worse. Nothing softened the\nold man; he remained unmoved, harsh, and cold as a granite rock. He\ncontinued to go and come about his business as usual; but ceased to\nstutter, talked less, and was more obdurate in business transactions\nthan ever before. Often he made mistakes in adding up his figures.\n\n\"Something is going on at the Grandets,\" said the Grassinists and the\nCruchotines.\n\n\"What has happened in the Grandet family?\" became a fixed question which\neverybody asked everybody else at the little evening-parties of Saumur.\nEugenie went to Mass escorted by Nanon. If Madame des Grassins said a\nfew words to her on coming out of church, she answered in an evasive\nmanner, without satisfying any curiosity. However, at the end of two\nmonths, it became impossible to hide, either from the three Cruchots\nor from Madame des Grassins, the fact that Eugenie was in confinement.\nThere came a moment when all pretexts failed to explain her perpetual\nabsence. Then, though it was impossible to discover by whom the secret\nhad been betrayed, all the town became aware that ever since New Year's\nday Mademoiselle Grandet had been kept in her room without fire, on\nbread and water, by her father's orders, and that Nanon cooked little\ndainties and took them to her secretly at night. It was even known that\nthe young woman was not able to see or take care of her mother, except\nat certain times when her father was out of the house.\n\nGrandet's conduct was severely condemned. The whole town outlawed him,\nso to speak; they remembered his treachery, his hard-heartedness,\nand they excommunicated him. When he passed along the streets, people\npointed him out and muttered at him. When his daughter came down the\nwinding street, accompanied by Nanon, on her way to Mass or Vespers, the\ninhabitants ran to the windows and examined with intense curiosity the\nbearing of the rich heiress and her countenance, which bore the\nimpress of angelic gentleness and melancholy. Her imprisonment and the\ncondemnation of her father were as nothing to her. Had she not a map of\nthe world, the little bench, the garden, the angle of the wall? Did she\nnot taste upon her lips the honey that love's kisses left there? She\nwas ignorant for a time that the town talked about her, just as Grandet\nhimself was ignorant of it. Pious and pure in heart before God, her\nconscience and her love helped her to suffer patiently the wrath and\nvengeance of her father.\n\nOne deep grief silenced all others. Her mother, that gentle, tender\ncreature, made beautiful by the light which shone from the inner to the\nouter as she approached the tomb,--her mother was perishing from day to\nday. Eugenie often reproached herself as the innocent cause of the slow,\ncruel malady that was wasting her away. This remorse, though her mother\nsoothed it, bound her still closer to her love. Every morning, as soon\nas her father left the house, she went to the bedside of her mother,\nand there Nanon brought her breakfast. The poor girl, sad, and suffering\nthrough the sufferings of her mother, would turn her face to the old\nservant with a mute gesture, weeping, and yet not daring to speak of her\ncousin. It was Madame Grandet who first found courage to say,--\n\n\"Where is _he_? Why does _he_ not write?\"\n\n\"Let us think about him, mother, but not speak of him. You are ill--you,\nbefore all.\"\n\n\"All\" meant \"him.\"\n\n\"My child,\" said Madame Grandet, \"I do not wish to live. God protects me\nand enables me to look with joy to the end of my misery.\"\n\nEvery utterance of this woman was unfalteringly pious and Christian.\nSometimes, during the first months of the year, when her husband came\nto breakfast with her and tramped up and down the room, she would say\nto him a few religious words, always spoken with angelic sweetness, yet\nwith the firmness of a woman to whom approaching death lends a courage\nshe had lacked in life.\n\n\"Monsieur, I thank you for the interest you take in my health,\" she\nwould answer when he made some commonplace inquiry; \"but if you really\ndesire to render my last moments less bitter and to ease my grief, take\nback your daughter: be a Christian, a husband, and a father.\"\n\nWhen he heard these words, Grandet would sit down by the bed with the\nair of a man who sees the rain coming and quietly gets under the shelter\nof a gateway till it is over. When these touching, tender, and religious\nsupplications had all been made, he would say,--\n\n\"You are rather pale to-day, my poor wife.\"\n\nAbsolute forgetfulness of his daughter seemed graven on his stony brow,\non his closed lips. He was unmoved by the tears which flowed down the\nwhite cheeks of his unhappy wife as she listened to his meaningless\nanswers.\n\n\"May God pardon you,\" she said, \"even as I pardon you! You will some day\nstand in need of mercy.\"\n\nSince Madame Grandet's illness he had not dared to make use of his\nterrible \"Ta, ta, ta, ta!\" Yet, for all that, his despotic nature was\nnot disarmed by this angel of gentleness, whose ugliness day by day\ndecreased, driven out by the ineffable expression of moral qualities\nwhich shone upon her face. She was all soul. The spirit of prayer seemed\nto purify her and refine those homely features and make them luminous.\nWho has not seen the phenomenon of a like transfiguration on sacred\nfaces where the habits of the soul have triumphed over the plainest\nfeatures, giving them that spiritual illumination whose light comes from\nthe purity and nobility of the inward thought? The spectacle of this\ntransformation wrought by the struggle which consumed the last shreds of\nthe human life of this woman, did somewhat affect the old cooper,\nthough feebly, for his nature was of iron; if his language ceased to\nbe contemptuous, an imperturbable silence, which saved his dignity as\nmaster of the household, took its place and ruled his conduct.\n\nWhen the faithful Nanon appeared in the market, many quips and quirks\nand complaints about the master whistled in her ears; but however loudly\npublic opinion condemned Monsieur Grandet, the old servant defended him,\nfor the honor of the family.\n\n\"Well!\" she would say to his detractors, \"don't we all get hard as\nwe grow old? Why shouldn't he get horny too? Stop telling lies.\nMademoiselle lives like a queen. She's alone, that's true; but she likes\nit. Besides, my masters have good reasons.\"\n\nAt last, towards the end of spring, Madame Grandet, worn out by grief\neven more than by illness, having failed, in spite of her prayers, to\nreconcile the father and daughter, confided her secret troubles to the\nCruchots.\n\n\"Keep a girl of twenty-three on bread and water!\" cried Monsieur de\nBonfons; \"without any reason, too! Why, that constitutes wrongful\ncruelty; she can contest, as much in as upon--\"\n\n\"Come, nephew, spare us your legal jargon,\" said the notary. \"Set your\nmind at ease, madame; I will put a stop to such treatment to-morrow.\"\n\nEugenie, hearing herself mentioned, came out of her room.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" she said, coming forward with a proud step, \"I beg you not\nto interfere in this matter. My father is master in his own house. As\nlong as I live under his roof I am bound to obey him. His conduct is\nnot subject to the approbation or the disapprobation of the world; he\nis accountable to God only. I appeal to your friendship to keep total\nsilence in this affair. To blame my father is to attack our family\nhonor. I am much obliged to you for the interest you have shown in\nme; you will do me an additional service if you will put a stop to\nthe offensive rumors which are current in the town, of which I am\naccidentally informed.\"\n\n\"She is right,\" said Madame Grandet.\n\n\"Mademoiselle, the best way to stop such rumors is to procure your\nliberty,\" answered the old notary respectfully, struck with the beauty\nwhich seclusion, melancholy, and love had stamped upon her face.\n\n\"Well, my daughter, let Monsieur Cruchot manage the matter if he is so\nsure of success. He understands your father, and how to manage him. If\nyou wish to see me happy for my few remaining days, you must, at any\ncost, be reconciled to your father.\"\n\nOn the morrow Grandet, in pursuance of a custom he had begun since\nEugenie's imprisonment, took a certain number of turns up and down the\nlittle garden; he had chosen the hour when Eugenie brushed and arranged\nher hair. When the old man reached the walnut-tree he hid behind its\ntrunk and remained for a few moments watching his daughter's movements,\nhesitating, perhaps, between the course to which the obstinacy of his\ncharacter impelled him and his natural desire to embrace his child.\nSometimes he sat down on the rotten old bench where Charles and Eugenie\nhad vowed eternal love; and then she, too, looked at her father secretly\nin the mirror before which she stood. If he rose and continued his walk,\nshe sat down obligingly at the window and looked at the angle of the\nwall where the pale flowers hung, where the Venus-hair grew from the\ncrevices with the bindweed and the sedum,--a white or yellow stone-crop\nvery abundant in the vineyards of Saumur and at Tours. Maitre Cruchot\ncame early, and found the old wine-grower sitting in the fine June\nweather on the little bench, his back against the division wall of the\ngarden, engaged in watching his daughter.\n\n\"What may you want, Maitre Cruchot?\" he said, perceiving the notary.\n\n\"I came to speak to you on business.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! have you brought some gold in exchange for my silver?\"\n\n\"No, no, I have not come about money; it is about your daughter Eugenie.\nAll the town is talking of her and you.\"\n\n\"What does the town meddle for? A man's house is his castle.\"\n\n\"Very true; and a man may kill himself if he likes, or, what is worse,\nhe may fling his money into the gutter.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, your wife is very ill, my friend. You ought to consult Monsieur\nBergerin; she is likely to die. If she does die without receiving proper\ncare, you will not be very easy in mind, I take it.\"\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta! you know a deal about my wife! These doctors, if they\nonce get their foot in your house, will come five and six times a day.\"\n\n\"Of course you will do as you think best. We are old friends; there is\nno one in all Saumur who takes more interest than I in what concerns\nyou. Therefore, I was bound to tell you this. However, happen what may,\nyou have the right to do as you please; you can choose your own course.\nBesides, that is not what brings me here. There is another thing which\nmay have serious results for you. After all, you can't wish to kill\nyour wife; her life is too important to you. Think of your situation in\nconnection with your daughter if Madame Grandet dies. You must render an\naccount to Eugenie, because you enjoy your wife's estate only during her\nlifetime. At her death your daughter can claim a division of property,\nand she may force you to sell Froidfond. In short, she is her mother's\nheir, and you are not.\"\n\nThese words fell like a thunderbolt on the old man, who was not as wise\nabout law as he was about business. He had never thought of a legal\ndivision of the estate.\n\n\"Therefore I advise you to treat her kindly,\" added Cruchot, in\nconclusion.\n\n\"But do you know what she has done, Cruchot?\"\n\n\"What?\" asked the notary, curious to hear the truth and find out the\ncause of the quarrel.\n\n\"She has given away her gold!\"\n\n\"Well, wasn't it hers?\" said the notary.\n\n\"They all tell me that!\" exclaimed the old man, letting his arms fall to\nhis sides with a movement that was truly tragic.\n\n\"Are you going--for a mere nothing,\"--resumed Cruchot, \"to put obstacles\nin the way of the concessions which you will be obliged to ask from your\ndaughter as soon as her mother dies?\"\n\n\"Do you call six thousand francs a mere nothing?\"\n\n\"Hey! my old friend, do you know what the inventory of your wife's\nproperty will cost, if Eugenie demands the division?\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Two, three, four thousand francs, perhaps! The property would have to\nbe put up at auction and sold, to get at its actual value. Instead of\nthat, if you are on good terms with--\"\n\n\"By the shears of my father!\" cried Grandet, turning pale as he suddenly\nsat down, \"we will see about it, Cruchot.\"\n\nAfter a moment's silence, full of anguish perhaps, the old man looked at\nthe notary and said,--\n\n\"Life is very hard! It has many griefs! Cruchot,\" he continued solemnly,\n\"you would not deceive me? Swear to me upon your honor that all you've\ntold me is legally true. Show me the law; I must see the law!\"\n\n\"My poor friend,\" said the notary, \"don't I know my own business?\"\n\n\"Then it is true! I am robbed, betrayed, killed, destroyed by my own\ndaughter!\"\n\n\"It is true that your daughter is her mother's heir.\"\n\n\"Why do we have children? Ah! my wife, I love her! Luckily she's sound\nand healthy; she's a Bertelliere.\"\n\n\"She has not a month to live.\"\n\nGrandet struck his forehead, went a few steps, came back, cast a\ndreadful look on Cruchot, and said,--\n\n\"What can be done?\"\n\n\"Eugenie can relinquish her claim to her mother's property. Should she\ndo this you would not disinherit her, I presume?--but if you want to\ncome to such a settlement, you must not treat her harshly. What I am\ntelling you, old man, is against my own interests. What do I live by,\nif it isn't liquidations, inventories, conveyances, divisions of\nproperty?--\"\n\n\"We'll see, we'll see! Don't let's talk any more about it, Cruchot; it\nwrings my vitals. Have you received any gold?\"\n\n\"No; but I have a few old louis, a dozen or so, which you may have.\nMy good friend, make it up with Eugenie. Don't you know all Saumur is\npelting you with stones?\"\n\n\"The scoundrels!\"\n\n\"Come, the Funds are at ninety-nine. Do be satisfied for once in your\nlife.\"\n\n\"At ninety-nine! Are they, Cruchot?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Hey, hey! Ninety-nine!\" repeated the old man, accompanying the notary\nto the street-door. Then, too agitated by what he had just heard to stay\nin the house, he went up to his wife's room and said,--\n\n\"Come, mother, you may have your daughter to spend the day with you.\nI'm going to Froidfond. Enjoy yourselves, both of you. This is our\nwedding-day, wife. See! here are sixty francs for your altar at the\nFete-Dieu; you've wanted one for a long time. Come, cheer up, enjoy\nyourself, and get well! Hurrah for happiness!\"\n\nHe threw ten silver pieces of six francs each upon the bed, and took his\nwife's head between his hands and kissed her forehead.\n\n\"My good wife, you are getting well, are not you?\"\n\n\"How can you think of receiving the God of mercy in your house when you\nrefuse to forgive your daughter?\" she said with emotion.\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta!\" said Grandet in a coaxing voice. \"We'll see about\nthat.\"\n\n\"Merciful heaven! Eugenie,\" cried the mother, flushing with joy, \"come\nand kiss your father; he forgives you!\"\n\nBut the old man had disappeared. He was going as fast as his legs could\ncarry him towards his vineyards, trying to get his confused ideas into\norder. Grandet had entered his seventy-sixth year. During the last two\nyears his avarice had increased upon him, as all the persistent passions\nof men increase at a certain age. As if to illustrate an observation\nwhich applies equally to misers, ambitious men, and others whose lives\nare controlled by any dominant idea, his affections had fastened upon\none special symbol of his passion. The sight of gold, the possession\nof gold, had become a monomania. His despotic spirit had grown in\nproportion to his avarice, and to part with the control of the smallest\nfraction of his property at the death of his wife seemed to him a thing\n\"against nature.\" To declare his fortune to his daughter, to give an\ninventory of his property, landed and personal, for the purposes of\ndivision--\n\n\"Why,\" he cried aloud in the midst of a field where he was pretending to\nexamine a vine, \"it would be cutting my throat!\"\n\nHe came at last to a decision, and returned to Saumur in time for\ndinner, resolved to unbend to Eugenie, and pet and coax her, that he\nmight die regally, holding the reins of his millions in his own hands so\nlong as the breath was in his body. At the moment when the old man, who\nchanced to have his pass-key in his pocket, opened the door and climbed\nwith a stealthy step up the stairway to go into his wife's room, Eugenie\nhad brought the beautiful dressing-case from the oak cabinet and placed\nit on her mother's bed. Mother and daughter, in Grandet's absence,\nallowed themselves the pleasure of looking for a likeness to Charles in\nthe portrait of his mother.\n\n\"It is exactly his forehead and his mouth,\" Eugenie was saying as the\nold man opened the door. At the look which her husband cast upon the\ngold, Madame Grandet cried out,--\n\n\"O God, have pity upon us!\"\n\nThe old man sprang upon the box as a famished tiger might spring upon a\nsleeping child.\n\n\"What's this?\" he said, snatching the treasure and carrying it to the\nwindow. \"Gold, good gold!\" he cried. \"All gold,--it weighs two pounds!\nHa, ha! Charles gave you that for your money, did he? Hein! Why didn't\nyou tell me so? It was a good bargain, little one! Yes, you are my\ndaughter, I see that--\" Eugenie trembled in every limb. \"This came from\nCharles, of course, didn't it?\" continued the old man.\n\n\"Yes, father; it is not mine. It is a sacred trust.\"\n\n\"Ta, ta, ta, ta! He took your fortune, and now you can get it back.\"\n\n\"Father!\"\n\nGrandet took his knife to pry out some of the gold; to do this, he\nplaced the dressing-case on a chair. Eugenie sprang forward to recover\nit; but her father, who had his eye on her and on the treasure too,\npushed her back so violently with a thrust of his arm that she fell upon\nher mother's bed.\n\n\"Monsieur, monsieur!\" cried the mother, lifting herself up.\n\nGrandet had opened his knife, and was about to apply it to the gold.\n\n\"Father!\" cried Eugenie, falling on her knees and dragging herself close\nto him with clasped hands, \"father, in the name of all the saints and\nthe Virgin! in the name of Christ who died upon the cross! in the name\nof your eternal salvation, father! for my life's sake, father!--do not\ntouch that! It is neither yours nor mine. It is a trust placed in my\nhands by an unhappy relation: I must give it back to him uninjured!\"\n\n\"If it is a trust, why were you looking at it? To look at it is as bad\nas touching it.\"\n\n\"Father, don't destroy it, or you will disgrace me! Father, do you\nhear?\"\n\n\"Oh, have pity!\" said the mother.\n\n\"Father!\" cried Eugenie in so startling a voice that Nanon ran upstairs\nterrified. Eugenie sprang upon a knife that was close at hand.\n\n\"Well, what now?\" said Grandet coldly, with a callous smile.\n\n\"Oh, you are killing me!\" said the mother.\n\n\"Father, if your knife so much as cuts a fragment of that gold, I will\nstab myself with this one! You have already driven my mother to her\ndeath; you will now kill your child! Do as you choose! Wound for wound!\"\n\nGrandet held his knife over the dressing-case and hesitated as he looked\nat his daughter.\n\n\"Are you capable of doing it, Eugenie?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" said the mother.\n\n\"She'll do it if she says so!\" cried Nanon. \"Be reasonable, monsieur,\nfor once in your life.\"\n\nThe old man looked at the gold and then at his daughter alternately for\nan instant. Madame Grandet fainted.\n\n\"There! don't you see, monsieur, that madame is dying?\" cried Nanon.\n\n\"Come, come, my daughter, we won't quarrel for a box! Here, take it!\"\nhe cried hastily, flinging the case upon the bed. \"Nanon, go and fetch\nMonsieur Bergerin! Come, mother,\" said he, kissing his wife's hand,\n\"it's all over! There! we've made up--haven't we, little one? No more\ndry bread; you shall have all you want--Ah, she opens her eyes! Well,\nmother, little mother, come! See, I'm kissing Eugenie! She loves her\ncousin, and she may marry him if she wants to; she may keep his case.\nBut don't die, mother; live a long time yet, my poor wife! Come, try\nto move! Listen! you shall have the finest altar that ever was made in\nSaumur.\"\n\n\"Oh, how can you treat your wife and daughter so!\" said Madame Grandet\nin a feeble voice.\n\n\"I won't do so again, never again,\" cried her husband; \"you shall see,\nmy poor wife!\" He went to his inner room and returned with a handful\nof louis, which he scattered on the bed. \"Here, Eugenie! see, wife! all\nthese are for you,\" he said, fingering the coins. \"Come, be happy,\nwife! feel better, get well; you sha'n't want for anything, nor Eugenie\neither. Here's a hundred _louis d'or_ for her. You won't give these\naway, will you, Eugenie, hein?\"\n\nMadame Grandet and her daughter looked at each other in astonishment.\n\n\"Take back your money, father; we ask for nothing but your affection.\"\n\n\"Well, well, that's right!\" he said, pocketing the coins; \"let's be good\nfriends! We will all go down to dinner to-day, and we'll play loto every\nevening for two sous. You shall both be happy. Hey, wife?\"\n\n\"Alas! I wish I could, if it would give you pleasure,\" said the dying\nwoman; \"but I cannot rise from my bed.\"\n\n\"Poor mother,\" said Grandet, \"you don't know how I love you! and you\ntoo, my daughter!\" He took her in his arms and kissed her. \"Oh, how\ngood it is to kiss a daughter when we have been angry with her! There,\nmother, don't you see it's all over now? Go and put that away, Eugenie,\"\nhe added, pointing to the case. \"Go, don't be afraid! I shall never\nspeak of it again, never!\"\n\nMonsieur Bergerin, the celebrated doctor of Saumur, presently arrived.\nAfter an examination, he told Grandet positively that his wife was very\nill; but that perfect peace of mind, a generous diet, and great care\nmight prolong her life until the autumn.\n\n\"Will all that cost much?\" said the old man. \"Will she need medicines?\"\n\n\"Not much medicine, but a great deal of care,\" answered the doctor, who\ncould scarcely restrain a smile.\n\n\"Now, Monsieur Bergerin,\" said Grandet, \"you are a man of honor, are\nnot you? I trust to you! Come and see my wife how and when you think\nnecessary. Save my good wife! I love her,--don't you see?--though I\nnever talk about it; I keep things to myself. I'm full of trouble.\nTroubles began when my brother died; I have to spend enormous sums on\nhis affairs in Paris. Why, I'm paying through my nose; there's no end\nto it. Adieu, monsieur! If you can save my wife, save her. I'll spare no\nexpense, not even if it costs me a hundred or two hundred francs.\"\n\nIn spite of Grandet's fervent wishes for the health of his wife, whose\ndeath threatened more than death to him; in spite of the consideration\nhe now showed on all occasions for the least wish of his astonished wife\nand daughter; in spite of the tender care which Eugenie lavished upon\nher mother,--Madame Grandet rapidly approached her end. Every day she\ngrew weaker and wasted visibly, as women of her age when attacked\nby serious illness are wont to do. She was fragile as the foliage in\nautumn; the radiance of heaven shone through her as the sun strikes\nathwart the withering leaves and gilds them. It was a death worthy of\nher life,--a Christian death; and is not that sublime? In the month\nof October, 1822, her virtues, her angelic patience, her love for her\ndaughter, seemed to find special expression; and then she passed away\nwithout a murmur. Lamb without spot, she went to heaven, regretting\nonly the sweet companion of her cold and dreary life, for whom her last\nglance seemed to prophesy a destiny of sorrows. She shrank from leaving\nher ewe-lamb, white as herself, alone in the midst of a selfish world\nthat sought to strip her of her fleece and grasp her treasures.\n\n\"My child,\" she said as she expired, \"there is no happiness except in\nheaven; you will know it some day.\"\n\n\n\n\nXII\n\nOn the morrow of this death Eugenie felt a new motive for attachment to\nthe house in which she was born, where she had suffered so much, where\nher mother had just died. She could not see the window and the chair on\nits castors without weeping. She thought she had mistaken the heart of\nher old father when she found herself the object of his tenderest cares.\nHe came in the morning and gave her his arm to take her to breakfast;\nhe looked at her for hours together with an eye that was almost kind; he\nbrooded over her as though she had been gold. The old man was so unlike\nhimself, he trembled so often before his daughter, that Nanon and the\nCruchotines, who witnessed his weakness, attributed it to his great age,\nand feared that his faculties were giving away. But the day on which\nthe family put on their mourning, and after dinner, to which meal Maitre\nCruchot (the only person who knew his secret) had been invited, the\nconduct of the old miser was explained.\n\n\"My dear child,\" he said to Eugenie when the table had been cleared and\nthe doors carefully shut, \"you are now your mother's heiress, and we\nhave a few little matters to settle between us. Isn't that so, Cruchot?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary to talk of them to-day, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, little one; I can't bear the uncertainty in which I'm placed.\nI think you don't want to give me pain?\"\n\n\"Oh! father--\"\n\n\"Well, then! let us settle it all to-night.\"\n\n\"What is it you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"My little girl, it is not for me to say. Tell her, Cruchot.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, your father does not wish to divide the property, nor\nsell the estate, nor pay enormous taxes on the ready money which he may\npossess. Therefore, to avoid all this, he must be released from making\nthe inventory of his whole fortune, part of which you inherit from your\nmother, and which is now undivided between you and your father--\"\n\n\"Cruchot, are you quite sure of what you are saying before you tell it\nto a mere child?\"\n\n\"Let me tell it my own way, Grandet.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, my friend. Neither you nor my daughter wish to rob me,--do\nyou, little one?\"\n\n\"But, Monsieur Cruchot, what am I to do?\" said Eugenie impatiently.\n\n\"Well,\" said the notary, \"it is necessary to sign this deed, by which\nyou renounce your rights to your mother's estate and leave your father\nthe use and disposition, during his lifetime, of all the property\nundivided between you, of which he guarantees you the capital.\"\n\n\"I do not understand a word of what you are saying,\" returned Eugenie;\n\"give me the deed, and show me where I am to sign it.\"\n\nPere Grandet looked alternately at the deed and at his daughter, at his\ndaughter and at the deed, undergoing as he did so such violent emotion\nthat he wiped the sweat from his brow.\n\n\"My little girl,\" he said, \"if, instead of signing this deed, which will\ncost a great deal to record, you would simply agree to renounce your\nrights as heir to your poor dear, deceased mother's property, and would\ntrust to me for the future, I should like it better. In that case I will\npay you monthly the good round sum of a hundred francs. See, now, you\ncould pay for as many masses as you want for anybody--Hein! a hundred\nfrancs a month--in _livres_?\"\n\n\"I will do all you wish, father.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the notary, \"it is my duty to point out to you that\nyou are despoiling yourself without guarantee--\"\n\n\"Good heavens! what is all that to me?\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, Cruchot! It's settled, all settled,\" cried Grandet,\ntaking his daughter's hand and striking it with his own. \"Eugenie, you\nwon't go back on your word?--you are an honest girl, hein?\"\n\n\"Oh! father!--\"\n\nHe kissed her effusively, and pressed her in his arms till he almost\nchoked her.\n\n\"Go, my good child, you restore your father's life; but you only return\nto him that which he gave you: we are quits. This is how business should\nbe done. Life is a business. I bless you! you are a virtuous girl,\nand you love your father. Do just what you like in future. To-morrow,\nCruchot,\" he added, looking at the horrified notary, \"you will see about\npreparing the deed of relinquishment, and then enter it on the records\nof the court.\"\n\nThe next morning Eugenie signed the papers by which she herself\ncompleted her spoliation. At the end of the first year, however, in\nspite of his bargain, the old man had not given his daughter one sou\nof the hundred francs he had so solemnly pledged to her. When Eugenie\npleasantly reminded him of this, he could not help coloring, and went\nhastily to his secret hiding-place, from whence he brought down about a\nthird of the jewels he had taken from his nephew, and gave them to her.\n\n\"There, little one,\" he said in a sarcastic tone, \"do you want those for\nyour twelve hundred francs?\"\n\n\"Oh! father, truly? will you really give them to me?\"\n\n\"I'll give you as many more next year,\" he said, throwing them into her\napron. \"So before long you'll get all his gewgaws,\" he added, rubbing\nhis hands, delighted to be able to speculate on his daughter's feelings.\n\nNevertheless, the old man, though still robust, felt the importance\nof initiating his daughter into the secrets of his thrift and its\nmanagement. For two consecutive years he made her order the household\nmeals in his presence and receive the rents, and he taught her slowly\nand successively the names and remunerative capacity of his vineyards\nand his farms. About the third year he had so thoroughly accustomed her\nto his avaricious methods that they had turned into the settled habits\nof her own life, and he was able to leave the household keys in her\ncharge without anxiety, and to install her as mistress of the house.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nFive years passed away without a single event to relieve the monotonous\nexistence of Eugenie and her father. The same actions were performed\ndaily with the automatic regularity of clockwork. The deep sadness of\nMademoiselle Grandet was known to every one; but if others surmised the\ncause, she herself never uttered a word that justified the suspicions\nwhich all Saumur entertained about the state of the rich heiress's\nheart. Her only society was made up of the three Cruchots and a few of\ntheir particular friends whom they had, little by little, introduced\ninto the Grandet household. They had taught her to play whist, and\nthey came every night for their game. During the year 1827 her father,\nfeeling the weight of his infirmities, was obliged to initiate her still\nfurther into the secrets of his landed property, and told her that in\ncase of difficulty she was to have recourse to Maitre Cruchot, whose\nintegrity was well known to him.\n\nTowards the end of this year the old man, then eighty-two, was seized by\nparalysis, which made rapid progress. Dr. Bergerin gave him up. Eugenie,\nfeeling that she was about to be left alone in the world, came, as it\nwere, nearer to her father, and clasped more tightly this last living\nlink of affection. To her mind, as in that of all loving women, love was\nthe whole of life. Charles was not there, and she devoted all her care\nand attention to the old father, whose faculties had begun to weaken,\nthough his avarice remained instinctively acute. The death of this man\noffered no contrast to his life. In the morning he made them roll him\nto a spot between the chimney of his chamber and the door of the secret\nroom, which was filled, no doubt, with gold. He asked for an explanation\nof every noise he heard, even the slightest; to the great astonishment\nof the notary, he even heard the watch-dog yawning in the court-yard. He\nwoke up from his apparent stupor at the day and hour when the rents\nwere due, or when accounts had to be settled with his vine-dressers, and\nreceipts given. At such times he worked his chair forward on its castors\nuntil he faced the door of the inner room. He made his daughter open it,\nand watched while she placed the bags of money one upon another in his\nsecret receptacles and relocked the door. Then she returned silently to\nher seat, after giving him the key, which he replaced in his waistcoat\npocket and fingered from time to time. His old friend the notary,\nfeeling sure that the rich heiress would inevitably marry his nephew\nthe president, if Charles Grandet did not return, redoubled all his\nattentions; he came every day to take Grandet's orders, went on his\nerrands to Froidfond, to the farms and the fields and the vineyards,\nsold the vintages, and turned everything into gold and silver, which\nfound their way in sacks to the secret hiding-place.\n\nAt length the last struggle came, in which the strong frame of the\nold man slowly yielded to destruction. He was determined to sit at\nthe chimney-corner facing the door of the secret room. He drew off and\nrolled up all the coverings which were laid over him, saying to Nanon,\n\"Put them away, lock them up, for fear they should be stolen.\"\n\nSo long as he could open his eyes, in which his whole being had now\ntaken refuge, he turned them to the door behind which lay his treasures,\nsaying to his daughter, \"Are they there? are they there?\" in a tone of\nvoice which revealed a sort of panic fear.\n\n\"Yes, my father,\" she would answer.\n\n\"Take care of the gold--put gold before me.\"\n\nEugenie would then spread coins on a table before him, and he would sit\nfor hours together with his eyes fixed upon them, like a child who, at\nthe moment it first begins to see, gazes in stupid contemplation at the\nsame object, and like the child, a distressful smile would flicker upon\nhis face.\n\n\"It warms me!\" he would sometimes say, as an expression of beatitude\nstole across his features.\n\nWhen the cure of the parish came to administer the last sacraments, the\nold man's eyes, sightless, apparently, for some hours, kindled at the\nsight of the cross, the candlesticks, and the holy-water vessel of\nsilver; he gazed at them fixedly, and his wen moved for the last time.\nWhen the priest put the crucifix of silver-gilt to his lips, that he\nmight kiss the Christ, he made a frightful gesture, as if to seize it;\nand that last effort cost him his life. He called Eugenie, whom he\ndid not see, though she was kneeling beside him bathing with tears his\nstiffening hand, which was already cold.\n\n\"My father, bless me!\" she entreated.\n\n\"Take care of it all. You will render me an account yonder!\" he said,\nproving by these last words that Christianity must always be the\nreligion of misers.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nEugenie Grandet was now alone in the world in that gray house, with none\nbut Nanon to whom she could turn with the certainty of being heard and\nunderstood,--Nanon the sole being who loved her for herself and with\nwhom she could speak of her sorrows. La Grande Nanon was a providence\nfor Eugenie. She was not a servant, but a humble friend. After her\nfather's death Eugenie learned from Maitre Cruchot that she possessed\nan income of three hundred thousand francs from landed and personal\nproperty in the arrondissement of Saumur; also six millions invested at\nthree per cent in the Funds (bought at sixty, and now worth seventy-six\nfrancs); also two millions in gold coin, and a hundred thousand francs\nin silver crown-pieces, besides all the interest which was still to be\ncollected. The sum total of her property reached seventeen millions.\n\n\"Where is my cousin?\" was her one thought.\n\nThe day on which Maitre Cruchot handed in to his client a clear and\nexact schedule of the whole inheritance, Eugenie remained alone with\nNanon, sitting beside the fireplace in the vacant hall, where all was\nnow a memory, from the chair on castors which her mother had sat in, to\nthe glass from which her cousin drank.\n\n\"Nanon, we are alone--\"\n\n\"Yes, mademoiselle; and if I knew where he was, the darling, I'd go on\nfoot to find him.\"\n\n\"The ocean is between us,\" she said.\n\nWhile the poor heiress wept in company of an old servant, in that cold\ndark house, which was to her the universe, the whole province rang, from\nNantes to Orleans, with the seventeen millions of Mademoiselle Grandet.\nAmong her first acts she had settled an annuity of twelve hundred francs\non Nanon, who, already possessed of six hundred more, became a rich and\nenviable match. In less than a month that good soul passed from single\nto wedded life under the protection of Antoine Cornoiller, who\nwas appointed keeper of all Mademoiselle Grandet's estates. Madame\nCornoiller possessed one striking advantage over her contemporaries.\nAlthough she was fifty-nine years of age, she did not look more than\nforty. Her strong features had resisted the ravages of time. Thanks to\nthe healthy customs of her semi-conventual life, she laughed at old age\nfrom the vantage-ground of a rosy skin and an iron constitution. Perhaps\nshe never looked as well in her life as she did on her marriage-day. She\nhad all the benefits of her ugliness, and was big and fat and strong,\nwith a look of happiness on her indestructible features which made a\ngood many people envy Cornoiller.\n\n\"Fast colors!\" said the draper.\n\n\"Quite likely to have children,\" said the salt merchant. \"She's pickled\nin brine, saving your presence.\"\n\n\"She is rich, and that fellow Cornoiller has done a good thing for\nhimself,\" said a third man.\n\nWhen she came forth from the old house on her way to the parish church,\nNanon, who was loved by all the neighborhood, received many compliments\nas she walked down the tortuous street. Eugenie had given her three\ndozen silver forks and spoons as a wedding present. Cornoiller, amazed\nat such magnificence, spoke of his mistress with tears in his eyes;\nhe would willingly have been hacked in pieces in her behalf. Madame\nCornoiller, appointed housekeeper to Mademoiselle Grandet, got as much\nhappiness out of her new position as she did from the possession of\na husband. She took charge of the weekly accounts; she locked up the\nprovisions and gave them out daily, after the manner of her defunct\nmaster; she ruled over two servants,--a cook, and a maid whose business\nit was to mend the house-linen and make mademoiselle's dresses.\nCornoiller combined the functions of keeper and bailiff. It is\nunnecessary to say that the women-servants selected by Nanon were\n\"perfect treasures.\" Mademoiselle Grandet thus had four servants, whose\ndevotion was unbounded. The farmers perceived no change after Monsieur\nGrandet's death; the usages and customs he had sternly established were\nscrupulously carried out by Monsieur and Madame Cornoiller.\n\nAt thirty years of age Eugenie knew none of the joys of life. Her\npale, sad childhood had glided on beside a mother whose heart, always\nmisunderstood and wounded, had known only suffering. Leaving this life\njoyfully, the mother pitied the daughter because she still must live;\nand she left in her child's soul some fugitive remorse and many lasting\nregrets. Eugenie's first and only love was a wellspring of sadness\nwithin her. Meeting her lover for a few brief days, she had given him\nher heart between two kisses furtively exchanged; then he had left her,\nand a whole world lay between them. This love, cursed by her father, had\ncost the life of her mother and brought her only sorrow, mingled with a\nfew frail hopes. Thus her upward spring towards happiness had wasted her\nstrength and given her nothing in exchange for it. In the life of\nthe soul, as in the physical life, there is an inspiration and a\nrespiration; the soul needs to absorb the sentiments of another soul and\nassimilate them, that it may render them back enriched. Were it not for\nthis glorious human phenomenon, there would be no life for the heart;\nair would be wanting; it would suffer, and then perish. Eugenie had\nbegun to suffer. For her, wealth was neither a power nor a consolation;\nshe could not live except through love, through religion, through faith\nin the future. Love explained to her the mysteries of eternity. Her\nheart and the Gospel taught her to know two worlds; she bathed, night\nand day, in the depths of two infinite thoughts, which for her may have\nhad but one meaning. She drew back within herself, loving, and believing\nherself beloved. For seven years her passion had invaded everything. Her\ntreasuries were not the millions whose revenues were rolling up; they\nwere Charles's dressing-case, the portraits hanging above her bed, the\njewels recovered from her father and proudly spread upon a bed of wool\nin a drawer of the oaken cabinet, the thimble of her aunt, used for a\nwhile by her mother, which she wore religiously as she worked at a piece\nof embroidery,--a Penelope's web, begun for the sole purpose of putting\nupon her finger that gold so rich in memories.\n\nIt seemed unlikely that Mademoiselle Grandet would marry during the\nperiod of her mourning. Her genuine piety was well known. Consequently\nthe Cruchots, whose policy was sagely guided by the old abbe, contented\nthemselves for the time being with surrounding the great heiress and\npaying her the most affectionate attentions. Every evening the hall was\nfilled with a party of devoted Cruchotines, who sang the praises of\nits mistress in every key. She had her doctor in ordinary, her grand\nalmoner, her chamberlain, her first lady of honor, her prime minister;\nabove all, her chancellor, a chancellor who would fain have said much to\nher. If the heiress had wished for a train-bearer, one would instantly\nhave been found. She was a queen, obsequiously flattered. Flattery never\nemanates from noble souls; it is the gift of little minds, who thus\nstill further belittle themselves to worm their way into the vital being\nof the persons around whom they crawl. Flattery means self-interest. So\nthe people who, night after night, assembled in Mademoiselle Grandet's\nhouse (they called her Mademoiselle de Froidfond) outdid each other in\nexpressions of admiration. This concert of praise, never before bestowed\nupon Eugenie, made her blush under its novelty; but insensibly her ear\nbecame habituated to the sound, and however coarse the compliments might\nbe, she soon was so accustomed to hear her beauty lauded that if\nany new-comer had seemed to think her plain, she would have felt the\nreproach far more than she might have done eight years earlier. She\nended at last by loving the incense, which she secretly laid at the feet\nof her idol. By degrees she grew accustomed to be treated as a sovereign\nand to see her court pressing around her every evening.\n\nMonsieur de Bonfons was the hero of the little circle, where his wit,\nhis person, his education, his amiability, were perpetually praised. One\nor another would remark that in seven years he had largely increased his\nfortune, that Bonfons brought in at least ten thousand francs a year,\nand was surrounded, like the other possessions of the Cruchots, by the\nvast domains of the heiress.\n\n\"Do you know, mademoiselle,\" said an habitual visitor, \"that the\nCruchots have an income of forty thousand francs among them!\"\n\n\"And then, their savings!\" exclaimed an elderly female Cruchotine,\nMademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.\n\n\"A gentleman from Paris has lately offered Monsieur Cruchot two hundred\nthousand francs for his practice,\" said another. \"He will sell it if he\nis appointed _juge de paix_.\"\n\n\"He wants to succeed Monsieur de Bonfons as president of the Civil\ncourts, and is taking measures,\" replied Madame d'Orsonval. \"Monsieur le\npresident will certainly be made councillor.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is a very distinguished man,\" said another,--\"don't you think\nso, mademoiselle?\"\n\nMonsieur de Bonfons endeavored to put himself in keeping with the role\nhe sought to play. In spite of his forty years, in spite of his dusky\nand crabbed features, withered like most judicial faces, he dressed\nin youthful fashions, toyed with a bamboo cane, never took snuff in\nMademoiselle de Froidfond's house, and came in a white cravat and a\nshirt whose pleated frill gave him a family resemblance to the race of\nturkeys. He addressed the beautiful heiress familiarly, and spoke of her\nas \"Our dear Eugenie.\" In short, except for the number of visitors, the\nchange from loto to whist, and the disappearance of Monsieur and Madame\nGrandet, the scene was about the same as the one with which this history\nopened. The pack were still pursuing Eugenie and her millions; but the\nhounds, more in number, lay better on the scent, and beset the prey more\nunitedly. If Charles could have dropped from the Indian Isles, he would\nhave found the same people and the same interests. Madame des Grassins,\nto whom Eugenie was full of kindness and courtesy, still persisted in\ntormenting the Cruchots. Eugenie, as in former days, was the central\nfigure of the picture; and Charles, as heretofore, would still have\nbeen the sovereign of all. Yet there had been some progress. The flowers\nwhich the president formerly presented to Eugenie on her birthdays and\nfete-days had now become a daily institution. Every evening he brought\nthe rich heiress a huge and magnificent bouquet, which Madame Cornoiller\nplaced conspicuously in a vase, and secretly threw into a corner of the\ncourt-yard when the visitors had departed.\n\nEarly in the spring, Madame des Grassins attempted to trouble the peace\nof the Cruchotines by talking to Eugenie of the Marquis de Froidfond,\nwhose ancient and ruined family might be restored if the heiress would\ngive him back his estates through marriage. Madame des Grassins rang\nthe changes on the peerage and the title of marquise, until, mistaking\nEugenie's disdainful smile for acquiescence, she went about proclaiming\nthat the marriage with \"Monsieur Cruchot\" was not nearly as certain as\npeople thought.\n\n\"Though Monsieur de Froidfond is fifty,\" she said, \"he does not look\nolder than Monsieur Cruchot. He is a widower, and he has children,\nthat's true. But then he is a marquis; he will be peer of France; and\nin times like these where you will find a better match? I know it for\na fact that Pere Grandet, when he put all his money into Froidfond,\nintended to graft himself upon that stock; he often told me so. He was a\ndeep one, that old man!\"\n\n\"Ah! Nanon,\" said Eugenie, one night as she was going to bed, \"how is it\nthat in seven years he has never once written to me?\"\n\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nWhile these events were happening in Saumur, Charles was making his\nfortune in the Indies. His commercial outfit had sold well. He began by\nrealizing a sum of six thousand dollars. Crossing the line had brushed a\ngood many cobwebs out of his brain; he perceived that the best means of\nattaining fortune in tropical regions, as well as in Europe, was to\nbuy and sell men. He went to the coast of Africa and bought Negroes,\ncombining his traffic in human flesh with that of other merchandise\nequally advantageous to his interests. He carried into this business an\nactivity which left him not a moment of leisure. He was governed by the\ndesire of reappearing in Paris with all the prestige of a large fortune,\nand by the hope of regaining a position even more brilliant than the one\nfrom which he had fallen.\n\nBy dint of jostling with men, travelling through many lands, and\nstudying a variety of conflicting customs, his ideas had been modified\nand had become sceptical. He ceased to have fixed principles of right\nand wrong, for he saw what was called a crime in one country lauded as\na virtue in another. In the perpetual struggle of selfish interests his\nheart grew cold, then contracted, and then dried up. The blood of the\nGrandets did not fail of its destiny; Charles became hard, and eager\nfor prey. He sold Chinamen, Negroes, birds' nests, children, artists; he\npractised usury on a large scale; the habit of defrauding custom-houses\nsoon made him less scrupulous about the rights of his fellow men.\nHe went to the Island of St. Thomas and bought, for a mere song,\nmerchandise that had been captured by pirates, and took it to ports\nwhere he could sell it at a good price. If the pure and noble face of\nEugenie went with him on his first voyage, like that image of the Virgin\nwhich Spanish mariners fastened to their masts, if he attributed his\nfirst success to the magic influence of the prayers and intercessions\nof his gentle love, later on women of other kinds,--blacks, mulattoes,\nwhites, and Indian dancing-girls,--orgies and adventures in many lands,\ncompletely effaced all recollection of his cousin, of Saumur, of the\nhouse, the bench, the kiss snatched in the dark passage. He remembered\nonly the little garden shut in with crumbling walls, for it was there he\nlearned the fate that had overtaken him; but he rejected all connection\nwith his family. His uncle was an old dog who had filched his jewels;\nEugenie had no place in his heart nor in his thoughts, though she did\nhave a place in his accounts as a creditor for the sum of six thousand\nfrancs.\n\nSuch conduct and such ideas explain Charles Grandet's silence. In the\nIndies, at St. Thomas, on the coast of Africa, at Lisbon, and in the\nUnited States the adventurer had taken the pseudonym of Shepherd, that\nhe might not compromise his own name. Charles Shepherd could safely\nbe indefatigable, bold, grasping, and greedy of gain, like a man who\nresolves to snatch his fortune _quibus cumque viis_, and makes haste\nto have done with villany, that he may spend the rest of his life as an\nhonest man.\n\nWith such methods, prosperity was rapid and brilliant; and in 1827\nCharles Grandet returned to Bordeaux on the \"Marie Caroline,\" a fine\nbrig belonging to a royalist house of business. He brought with him\nnineteen hundred thousand francs worth of gold-dust, from which he\nexpected to derive seven or eight per cent more at the Paris mint.\nOn the brig he met a gentleman-in-ordinary to His Majesty Charles X.,\nMonsieur d'Aubrion, a worthy old man who had committed the folly of\nmarrying a woman of fashion with a fortune derived from the West India\nIslands. To meet the costs of Madame d'Aubrion's extravagance, he had\ngone out to the Indies to sell the property, and was now returning with\nhis family to France.\n\nMonsieur and Madame d'Aubrion, of the house of d'Aubrion de Buch, a\nfamily of southern France, whose last _captal_, or chief, died before\n1789, were now reduced to an income of about twenty thousand francs, and\nthey possessed an ugly daughter whom the mother was resolved to marry\nwithout a _dot_,--the family fortune being scarcely sufficient for the\ndemands of her own life in Paris. This was an enterprise whose success\nmight have seemed problematical to most men of the world, in spite of\nthe cleverness with which such men credit a fashionable woman; in\nfact, Madame d'Aubrion herself, when she looked at her daughter, almost\ndespaired of getting rid of her to any one, even to a man craving\nconnection with nobility. Mademoiselle d'Aubrion was a long, spare,\nspindling demoiselle, like her namesake the insect; her mouth was\ndisdainful; over it hung a nose that was too long, thick at the end,\nsallow in its normal condition, but very red after a meal,--a sort of\nvegetable phenomenon which is particularly disagreeable when it appears\nin the middle of a pale, dull, and uninteresting face. In one sense she\nwas all that a worldly mother, thirty-eight years of age and still\na beauty with claims to admiration, could have wished. However, to\ncounterbalance her personal defects, the marquise gave her daughter\na distinguished air, subjected her to hygienic treatment which\nprovisionally kept her nose at a reasonable flesh-tint, taught her the\nart of dressing well, endowed her with charming manners, showed her the\ntrick of melancholy glances which interest a man and make him believe\nthat he has found a long-sought angel, taught her the manoeuvre of the\nfoot,--letting it peep beneath the petticoat, to show its tiny size,\nat the moment when the nose became aggressively red; in short, Madame\nd'Aubrion had cleverly made the very best of her offspring. By means\nof full sleeves, deceptive pads, puffed dresses amply trimmed,\nand high-pressure corsets, she had obtained such curious feminine\ndevelopments that she ought, for the instruction of mothers, to have\nexhibited them in a museum.\n\nCharles became very intimate with Madame d'Aubrion precisely because she\nwas desirous of becoming intimate with him. Persons who were on board\nthe brig declared that the handsome Madame d'Aubrion neglected no means\nof capturing so rich a son-in-law. On landing at Bordeaux in June, 1827,\nMonsieur, Madame, Mademoiselle d'Aubrion, and Charles lodged at the same\nhotel and started together for Paris. The hotel d'Aubrion was hampered\nwith mortgages; Charles was destined to free it. The mother told him how\ndelighted she would be to give up the ground-floor to a son-in-law. Not\nsharing Monsieur d'Aubrion's prejudices on the score of nobility, she\npromised Charles Grandet to obtain a royal ordinance from Charles\nX. which would authorize him, Grandet, to take the name and arms\nof d'Aubrion and to succeed, by purchasing the entailed estate for\nthirty-six thousand francs a year, to the titles of Captal de Buch and\nMarquis d'Aubrion. By thus uniting their fortunes, living on good terms,\nand profiting by sinecures, the two families might occupy the hotel\nd'Aubrion with an income of over a hundred thousand francs.\n\n\"And when a man has a hundred thousand francs a year, a name, a\nfamily, and a position at court,--for I will get you appointed as\ngentleman-of-the-bedchamber,--he can do what he likes,\" she said to\nCharles. \"You can then become anything you choose,--master of the\nrolls in the council of State, prefect, secretary to an embassy, the\nambassador himself, if you like. Charles X. is fond of d'Aubrion; they\nhave known each other from childhood.\"\n\nIntoxicated with ambition, Charles toyed with the hopes thus cleverly\npresented to him in the guise of confidences poured from heart to heart.\nBelieving his father's affairs to have been settled by his uncle, he\nimagined himself suddenly anchored in the Faubourg Saint-Germain,--that\nsocial object of all desire, where, under shelter of Mademoiselle\nMathilde's purple nose, he was to reappear as the Comte d'Aubrion, very\nmuch as the Dreux reappeared in Breze. Dazzled by the prosperity of the\nRestoration, which was tottering when he left France, fascinated by the\nsplendor of aristocratic ideas, his intoxication, which began on the\nbrig, increased after he reached Paris, and he finally determined to\ntake the course and reach the high position which the selfish hopes of\nhis would-be mother-in-law pointed out to him. His cousin counted for\nno more than a speck in this brilliant perspective; but he went to see\nAnnette. True woman of the world, Annette advised her old friend to\nmake the marriage, and promised him her support in all his ambitious\nprojects. In her heart she was enchanted to fasten an ugly and\nuninteresting girl on Charles, whose life in the West Indies had\nrendered him very attractive. His complexion had bronzed, his manners\nhad grown decided and bold, like those of a man accustomed to make sharp\ndecisions, to rule, and to succeed. Charles breathed more at his ease in\nParis, conscious that he now had a part to play.\n\nDes Grassins, hearing of his return, of his approaching marriage and\nhis large fortune, came to see him, and inquired about the three hundred\nthousand francs still required to settle his father's debts. He found\nGrandet in conference with a goldsmith, from whom he had ordered jewels\nfor Mademoiselle d'Aubrion's _corbeille_, and who was then submitting\nthe designs. Charles had brought back magnificent diamonds, and the\nvalue of their setting, together with the plate and jewelry of the new\nestablishment, amounted to more than two hundred thousand francs. He\nreceived des Grassins, whom he did not recognize, with the impertinence\nof a young man of fashion conscious of having killed four men in as many\nduels in the Indies. Monsieur des Grassins had already called several\ntimes. Charles listened to him coldly, and then replied, without fully\nunderstanding what had been said to him,--\n\n\"My father's affairs are not mine. I am much obliged, monsieur, for the\ntrouble you have been good enough to take,--by which, however, I really\ncannot profit. I have not earned two millions by the sweat of my brow to\nfling them at the head of my father's creditors.\"\n\n\"But suppose that your father's estate were within a few days to be\ndeclared bankrupt?\"\n\n\"Monsieur, in a few days I shall be called the Comte d'Aubrion; you will\nunderstand, therefore, that what you threaten is of no consequence to\nme. Besides, you know as well as I do that when a man has an income of\na hundred thousand francs his father has _never failed_.\" So saying, he\npolitely edged Monsieur des Grassins to the door.\n\n              *     *     *     *     *\n\nAt the beginning of August in the same year, Eugenie was sitting on the\nlittle wooden bench where her cousin had sworn to love her eternally,\nand where she usually breakfasted if the weather were fine. The poor\ngirl was happy, for the moment, in the fresh and joyous summer air,\nletting her memory recall the great and the little events of her love\nand the catastrophes which had followed it. The sun had just reached\nthe angle of the ruined wall, so full of chinks, which no one, through\na caprice of the mistress, was allowed to touch, though Cornoiller often\nremarked to his wife that \"it would fall and crush somebody one of these\ndays.\" At this moment the postman knocked, and gave a letter to Madame\nCornoiller, who ran into the garden, crying out:\n\n\"Mademoiselle, a letter!\" She gave it to her mistress, adding, \"Is it\nthe one you expected?\"\n\nThe words rang as loudly in the heart of Eugenie as they echoed in sound\nfrom wall to wall of the court and garden.\n\n\"Paris--from him--he has returned!\"\n\nEugenie turned pale and held the letter for a moment. She trembled\nso violently that she could not break the seal. La Grande Nanon stood\nbefore her, both hands on her hips, her joy puffing as it were like\nsmoke through the cracks of her brown face.\n\n\"Read it, mademoiselle!\"\n\n\"Ah, Nanon, why did he return to Paris? He went from Saumur.\"\n\n\"Read it, and you'll find out.\"\n\nEugenie opened the letter with trembling fingers. A cheque on the house\nof \"Madame des Grassins and Coret, of Saumur,\" fluttered down. Nanon\npicked it up.\n\n  My dear Cousin,--\n\n\"No longer 'Eugenie,'\" she thought, and her heart quailed.\n\n  You--\n\n\"He once said 'thou.'\" She folded her arms and dared not read another\nword; great tears gathered in her eyes.\n\n\"Is he dead?\" asked Nanon.\n\n\"If he were, he could not write,\" said Eugenie.\n\nShe then read the whole letter, which was as follows:\n\n  My dear Cousin,--You will, I am sure, hear with pleasure of the\n  success of my enterprise. You brought me luck; I have come back\n  rich, and I have followed the advice of my uncle, whose death,\n  together with that of my aunt, I have just learned from Monsieur\n  des Grassins. The death of parents is in the course of nature, and\n  we must succeed them. I trust you are by this time consoled.\n  Nothing can resist time, as I am well aware. Yes, my dear cousin,\n  the day of illusions is, unfortunately, gone for me. How could it\n  be otherwise? Travelling through many lands, I have reflected upon\n  life. I was a child when I went away,--I have come back a man.\n  To-day, I think of many I did not dream of then. You are free, my\n  dear cousin, and I am free still. Nothing apparently hinders the\n  realization of our early hopes; but my nature is too loyal to hide\n  from you the situation in which I find myself. I have not\n  forgotten our relations; I have always remembered, throughout my\n  long wanderings, the little wooden seat--\n\nEugenie rose as if she were sitting on live coals, and went away and sat\ndown on the stone steps of the court.\n\n  --the little wooden seat where we vowed to love each other\n  forever, the passage, the gray hall, my attic chamber, and the\n  night when, by your delicate kindness, you made my future easier\n  to me. Yes, these recollections sustained my courage; I said in my\n  heart that you were thinking of me at the hour we had agreed upon.\n  Have you always looked at the clouds at nine o'clock? Yes, I am\n  sure of it. I cannot betray so true a friendship,--no, I must not\n  deceive you. An alliance has been proposed to me which satisfies\n  all my ideas of matrimony. Love in marriage is a delusion. My\n  present experience warns me that in marrying we are bound to obey\n  all social laws and meet the conventional demands of the world.\n  Now, between you and me there are differences which might affect\n  your future, my dear cousin, even more than they would mine. I\n  will not here speak of your customs and inclinations, your\n  education, nor yet of your habits, none of which are in keeping\n  with Parisian life, or with the future which I have marked out for\n  myself. My intention is to keep my household on a stately footing,\n  to receive much company,--in short, to live in the world; and I\n  think I remember that you love a quiet and tranquil life. I will\n  be frank, and make you the judge of my situation; you have the\n  right to understand it and to judge it.\n\n  I possess at the present moment an income of eighty thousand\n  francs. This fortune enables me to marry into the family of\n  Aubrion, whose heiress, a young girl nineteen years of age, brings\n  me a title, a place of gentleman-of-the-bed-chamber to His\n  Majesty, and a very brilliant position. I will admit to you, my\n  dear cousin, that I do not love Mademoiselle d'Aubrion; but in\n  marrying her I secure to my children a social rank whose\n  advantages will one day be incalculable: monarchical principles\n  are daily coming more and more into favor. Thus in course of time\n  my son, when he becomes Marquis d'Aubrion, having, as he then will\n  have, an entailed estate with a rental of forty thousand francs a\n  year, can obtain any position in the State which he may think\n  proper to select. We owe ourselves to our children.\n\n  You see, my cousin, with what good faith I lay the state of my\n  heart, my hopes, and my fortune before you. Possibly, after seven\n  years' separation, you have yourself forgotten our youthful loves;\n  but I have never forgotten either your kindness or my own words. I\n  remember all, even words that were lightly uttered,--words by\n  which a man less conscientious than I, with a heart less youthful\n  and less upright, would scarcely feel himself bound. In telling\n  you that the marriage I propose to make is solely one of\n  convenience, that I still remember our childish love, am I not\n  putting myself entirely in your hands and making you the mistress\n  of my fate? am I not telling you that if I must renounce my social\n  ambitions, I shall willingly content myself with the pure and\n  simple happiness of which you have shown me so sweet an image?\n\n\"Tan, ta, ta--tan, ta, ti,\" sang Charles Grandet to the air of _Non piu\nandrai_, as he signed himself,--\n\nYour devoted cousin, Charles.\n\n\n\"Thunder! that's doing it handsomely!\" he said, as he looked about him\nfor the cheque; having found it, he added the words:--\n\n  P.S.--I enclose a cheque on the des Grassins bank for eight\n  thousand francs to your order, payable in gold, which includes the\n  capital and interest of the sum you were kind enough to lend me. I\n  am expecting a case from Bordeaux which contains a few things\n  which you must allow me to offer you as a mark of my unceasing\n  gratitude. You can send my dressing-case by the diligence to the\n  hotel d'Aubrion, rue Hillerin-Bertin.\n\n\"By the diligence!\" said Eugenie. \"A thing for which I would have laid\ndown my life!\"\n\nTerrible and utter disaster! The ship went down, leaving not a spar, not\na plank, on a vast ocean of hope! Some women when they see themselves\nabandoned will try to tear their lover from the arms of a rival, they\nwill kill her, and rush to the ends of the earth,--to the scaffold, to\ntheir tomb. That, no doubt, is fine; the motive of the crime is a great\npassion, which awes even human justice. Other women bow their heads\nand suffer in silence; they go their way dying, resigned, weeping,\nforgiving, praying, and recollecting, till they draw their last breath.\nThis is love,--true love, the love of angels, the proud love which lives\nupon its anguish and dies of it. Such was Eugenie's love after she had\nread that dreadful letter. She raised her eyes to heaven, thinking of\nthe last words uttered by her dying mother, who, with the prescience\nof death, had looked into the future with clear and penetrating eyes:\nEugenie, remembering that prophetic death, that prophetic life, measured\nwith one glance her own destiny. Nothing was left for her; she could\nonly unfold her wings, stretch upward to the skies, and live in prayer\nuntil the day of her deliverance.\n\n\"My mother was right,\" she said, weeping. \"Suffer--and die!\"\n\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nEugenie came slowly back from the garden to the house, and avoided\npassing, as was her custom, through the corridor. But the memory of her\ncousin was in the gray old hall and on the chimney-piece, where stood\na certain saucer and the old Sevres sugar-bowl which she used every\nmorning at her breakfast.\n\nThis day was destined to be solemn throughout and full of events. Nanon\nannounced the cure of the parish church. He was related to the Cruchots,\nand therefore in the interests of Monsieur de Bonfons. For some time\npast the old abbe had urged him to speak to Mademoiselle Grandet, from\na purely religious point of view, about the duty of marriage for a woman\nin her position. When she saw her pastor, Eugenie supposed he had come\nfor the thousand francs which she gave monthly to the poor, and she told\nNanon to go and fetch them; but the cure only smiled.\n\n\"To-day, mademoiselle,\" he said, \"I have come to speak to you about\na poor girl in whom the whole town of Saumur takes an interest, who,\nthrough lack of charity to herself, neglects her Christian duties.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le cure, you have come to me at a moment when I cannot think\nof my neighbor, I am filled with thoughts of myself. I am very unhappy;\nmy only refuge is in the Church; her bosom is large enough to hold all\nhuman woe, her love so full that we may draw from its depths and never\ndrain it dry.\"\n\n\"Mademoiselle, in speaking of this young girl we shall speak of you.\nListen! If you wish to insure your salvation you have only two paths to\ntake,--either leave the world or obey its laws. Obey either your earthly\ndestiny or your heavenly destiny.\"\n\n\"Ah! your voice speaks to me when I need to hear a voice. Yes, God has\nsent you to me; I will bid farewell to the world and live for God alone,\nin silence and seclusion.\"\n\n\"My daughter, you must think long before you take so violent a step.\nMarriage is life, the veil is death.\"\n\n\"Yes, death,--a quick death!\" she said, with dreadful eagerness.\n\n\"Death? but you have great obligations to fulfil to society,\nmademoiselle. Are you not the mother of the poor, to whom you give\nclothes and wood in winter and work in summer? Your great fortune is a\nloan which you must return, and you have sacredly accepted it as such.\nTo bury yourself in a convent would be selfishness; to remain an old\nmaid is to fail in duty. In the first place, can you manage your vast\nproperty alone? May you not lose it? You will have law-suits, you will\nfind yourself surrounded by inextricable difficulties. Believe your\npastor: a husband is useful; you are bound to preserve what God has\nbestowed upon you. I speak to you as a precious lamb of my flock. You\nlove God too truly not to find your salvation in the midst of his world,\nof which you are noble ornament and to which you owe your example.\"\n\nAt this moment Madame des Grassins was announced. She came incited by\nvengeance and the sense of a great despair.\n\n\"Mademoiselle,\" she said--\"Ah! here is monsieur le cure; I am silent.\nI came to speak to you on business; but I see that you are conferring\nwith--\"\n\n\"Madame,\" said the cure, \"I leave the field to you.\"\n\n\"Oh! monsieur le cure,\" said Eugenie, \"come back later; your support is\nvery necessary to me just now.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, indeed, my poor child!\" said Madame des Grassins.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Eugenie and the cure together.\n\n\"Don't I know about your cousin's return, and his marriage with\nMademoiselle d'Aubrion? A woman doesn't carry her wits in her pocket.\"\n\nEugenie blushed, and remained silent for a moment. From this day forth\nshe assumed the impassible countenance for which her father had been so\nremarkable.\n\n\"Well, madame,\" she presently said, ironically, \"no doubt I carry my\nwits in my pocket, for I do not understand you. Speak, say what you\nmean, before monsieur le cure; you know he is my director.\"\n\n\"Well, then, mademoiselle, here is what des Grassins writes me. Read\nit.\"\n\nEugenie read the following letter:--\n\n  My dear Wife,--Charles Grandet has returned from the Indies and\n  has been in Paris about a month--\n\n\"A month!\" thought Eugenie, her hand falling to her side. After a pause\nshe resumed the letter,--\n\n  I had to dance attendance before I was allowed to see the future\n  Vicomte d'Aubrion. Though all Paris is talking of his marriage and\n  the banns are published--\n\n\"He wrote to me after that!\" thought Eugenie. She did not conclude the\nthought; she did not cry out, as a Parisian woman would have done, \"The\nvillain!\" but though she said it not, contempt was none the less present\nin her mind.\n\n  The marriage, however, will not come off. The Marquis d'Aubrion\n  will never give his daughter to the son of a bankrupt. I went to\n  tell Grandet of the steps his uncle and I took in his father's\n  business, and the clever manoeuvres by which we had managed to\n  keep the creditor's quiet until the present time. The insolent\n  fellow had the face to say to me--to me, who for five years have\n  devoted myself night and day to his interests and his honor!--that\n  _his father's affairs were not his_! A solicitor would have had\n  the right to demand fees amounting to thirty or forty thousand\n  francs, one per cent on the total of the debts. But patience!\n  there are twelve hundred thousand francs legitimately owing to the\n  creditors, and I shall at once declare his father a bankrupt.\n\n  I went into this business on the word of that old crocodile\n  Grandet, and I have made promises in the name of his family. If\n  Monsieur de vicomte d'Aubrion does not care for his honor, I care\n  for mine. I shall explain my position to the creditors. Still, I\n  have too much respect for Mademoiselle Eugenie (to whom under\n  happier circumstances we once hoped to be allied) to act in this\n  matter before you have spoken to her about it--\n\nThere Eugenie paused, and coldly returned the letter without finishing\nit.\n\n\"I thank you,\" she said to Madame des Grassins.\n\n\"Ah! you have the voice and manner of your deceased father,\" Madame des\nGrassins replied.\n\n\"Madame, you have eight thousand francs to pay us,\" said Nanon,\nproducing Charles's cheque.\n\n\"That's true; have the kindness to come with me now, Madame Cornoiller.\"\n\n\"Monsieur le cure,\" said Eugenie with a noble composure, inspired by the\nthought she was about to express, \"would it be a sin to remain a virgin\nafter marriage?\"\n\n\"That is a case of conscience whose solution is not within my knowledge.\nIf you wish to know what the celebrated Sanchez says of it in his\ntreatise 'De Matrimonio,' I shall be able to tell you to-morrow.\"\n\nThe cure went away; Mademoiselle Grandet went up to her father's secret\nroom and spent the day there alone, without coming down to dinner, in\nspite of Nanon's entreaties. She appeared in the evening at the hour\nwhen the usual company began to arrive. Never was the old hall so\nfull as on this occasion. The news of Charles's return and his foolish\ntreachery had spread through the whole town. But however watchful the\ncuriosity of the visitors might be, it was left unsatisfied. Eugenie,\nwho expected scrutiny, allowed none of the cruel emotions that wrung her\nsoul to appear on the calm surface of her face. She was able to show a\nsmiling front in answer to all who tried to testify their interest by\nmournful looks or melancholy speeches. She hid her misery behind a veil\nof courtesy. Towards nine o'clock the games ended and the players left\nthe tables, paying their losses and discussing points of the game as\nthey joined the rest of the company. At the moment when the whole party\nrose to take leave, an unexpected and striking event occurred, which\nresounded through the length and breadth of Saumur, from thence through\nthe arrondissement, and even to the four surrounding prefectures.\n\n\"Stay, monsieur le president,\" said Eugenie to Monsieur de Bonfons as\nshe saw him take his cane.\n\nThere was not a person in that numerous assembly who was unmoved by\nthese words. The president turned pale, and was forced to sit down.\n\n\"The president gets the millions,\" said Mademoiselle de Gribeaucourt.\n\n\"It is plain enough; the president marries Mademoiselle Grandet,\" cried\nMadame d'Orsonval.\n\n\"All the trumps in one hand,\" said the abbe.\n\n\"A love game,\" said the notary.\n\nEach and all said his say, made his pun, and looked at the heiress\nmounted on her millions as on a pedestal. The drama begun nine years\nbefore had reached its conclusion. To tell the president, in face of\nall Saumur, to \"stay,\" was surely the same thing as proclaiming him her\nhusband. In provincial towns social conventionalities are so rigidly\nenforced than an infraction like this constituted a solemn promise.\n\n\"Monsieur le president,\" said Eugenie in a voice of some emotion when\nthey were left alone, \"I know what pleases you in me. Swear to leave me\nfree during my whole life, to claim none of the rights which marriage\nwill give you over me, and my hand is yours. Oh!\" she added, seeing him\nabout to kneel at her feet, \"I have more to say. I must not deceive you.\nIn my heart I cherish one inextinguishable feeling. Friendship is the\nonly sentiment which I can give to a husband. I wish neither to affront\nhim nor to violate the laws of my own heart. But you can possess my hand\nand my fortune only at the cost of doing me an inestimable service.\"\n\n\"I am ready for all things,\" said the president.\n\n\"Here are fifteen hundred thousand francs,\" she said, drawing from her\nbosom a certificate of a hundred shares in the Bank of France. \"Go to\nParis,--not to-morrow, but instantly. Find Monsieur des Grassins, learn\nthe names of my uncle's creditors, call them together, pay them in full\nall that was owing, with interest at five per cent from the day the debt\nwas incurred to the present time. Be careful to obtain a full and legal\nreceipt, in proper form, before a notary. You are a magistrate, and I\ncan trust this matter in your hands. You are a man of honor; I will put\nfaith in your word, and meet the dangers of life under shelter of your\nname. Let us have mutual indulgence. We have known each other so long\nthat we are almost related; you would not wish to render me unhappy.\"\n\nThe president fell at the feet of the rich heiress, his heart beating\nand wrung with joy.\n\n\"I will be your slave!\" he said.\n\n\"When you obtain the receipts, monsieur,\" she resumed, with a cold\nglance, \"you will take them with all the other papers to my cousin\nGrandet, and you will give him this letter. On your return I will keep\nmy word.\"\n\nThe president understood perfectly that he owed the acquiescence of\nMademoiselle Grandet to some bitterness of love, and he made haste to\nobey her orders, lest time should effect a reconciliation between the\npair.\n\nWhen Monsieur de Bonfons left her, Eugenie fell back in her chair and\nburst into tears. All was over.\n\nThe president took the mail-post, and reached Paris the next evening.\nThe morning after his arrival he went to see des Grassins, and together\nthey summoned the creditors to meet at the notary's office where the\nvouchers had been deposited. Not a single creditor failed to be present.\nCreditors though they were, justice must be done to them,--they were all\npunctual. Monsieur de Bonfons, in the name of Mademoiselle Grandet, paid\nthem the amount of their claims with interest. The payment of interest\nwas a remarkable event in the Parisian commerce of that day. When the\nreceipts were all legally registered, and des Grassins had received for\nhis services the sum of fifty thousand francs allowed to him by Eugenie,\nthe president made his way to the hotel d'Aubrion and found Charles\njust entering his own apartment after a serious encounter with his\nprospective father-in-law. The old marquis had told him plainly that\nhe should not marry his daughter until all the creditors of Guillaume\nGrandet had been paid in full.\n\nThe president gave Charles the following letter:--\n\n  My Cousin,--Monsieur le president de Bonfons has undertaken to\n  place in your hands the aquittance for all claims upon my uncle,\n  also a receipt by which I acknowledge having received from you the\n  sum total of those claims. I have heard of a possible failure, and\n  I think that the son of a bankrupt may not be able to marry\n  Mademoiselle d'Aubrion. Yes, my cousin, you judged rightly of my\n  mind and of my manners. I have, it is true, no part in the world;\n  I understand neither its calculations nor its customs; and I could\n  not give you the pleasures that you seek in it. Be happy,\n  according to the social conventions to which you have sacrificed\n  our love. To make your happiness complete I can only offer you\n  your father's honor. Adieu! You will always have a faithful friend\n  in your cousin\n\nEugenie.\n\n\nThe president smiled at the exclamation which the ambitious young man\ncould not repress as he received the documents.\n\n\"We shall announce our marriages at the same time,\" remarked Monsieur de\nBonfons.\n\n\"Ah! you marry Eugenie? Well, I am delighted; she is a good girl. But,\"\nadded Charles, struck with a luminous idea, \"she must be rich?\"\n\n\"She had,\" said the president, with a mischievous smile, \"about nineteen\nmillions four days ago; but she has only seventeen millions to-day.\"\n\nCharles looked at him thunderstruck.\n\n\"Seventeen mil--\"\n\n\"Seventeen millions; yes, monsieur. We shall muster, Mademoiselle\nGrandet and I, an income of seven hundred and fifty thousand francs when\nwe marry.\"\n\n\"My dear cousin,\" said Charles, recovering a little of his assurance,\n\"we can push each other's fortunes.\"\n\n\"Agreed,\" said the president. \"Here is also a little case which I am\ncharged to give into your own hands,\" he added, placing on the table the\nleather box which contained the dressing-case.\n\n\"Well, my dear friend,\" said Madame d'Aubrion, entering the room without\nnoticing the president, \"don't pay any attention to what poor Monsieur\nd'Aubrion has just said to you; the Duchesse de Chaulieu has turned his\nhead. I repeat, nothing shall interfere with the marriage--\"\n\n\"Very good, madame. The three millions which my father owed were paid\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"In money?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, in full, capital and interest; and I am about to do honor to his\nmemory--\"\n\n\"What folly!\" exclaimed his mother-in-law. \"Who is this?\" she whispered\nin Grandet's ear, perceiving the president.\n\n\"My man of business,\" he answered in a low voice.\n\nThe marquise bowed superciliously to Monsieur de Bonfons.\n\n\"We are pushing each other's fortunes already,\" said the president,\ntaking up his hat. \"Good-by, cousin.\"\n\n\"He is laughing at me, the old cockatoo! I'd like to put six inches of\niron into him!\" muttered Charles.\n\nThe president was out of hearing. Three days later Monsieur de Bonfons,\non his return to Saumur, announced his marriage with Eugenie. Six months\nafter the marriage he was appointed councillor in the Cour royale at\nAngers. Before leaving Saumur Madame de Bonfons had the gold of certain\njewels, once so precious to her, melted up, and put, together with the\neight thousand francs paid back by her cousin, into a golden pyx, which\nshe gave to the parish church where she had so long prayed for _him_.\nShe now spent her time between Angers and Saumur. Her husband, who had\nshown some public spirit on a certain occasion, became a judge in the\nsuperior courts, and finally, after a few years, president of them. He\nwas anxiously awaiting a general election, in the hope of being returned\nto the Chamber of deputies. He hankered after a peerage; and then--\n\n\"The king will be his cousin, won't he?\" said Nanon, la Grande Nanon,\nMadame Cornoiller, bourgeoise of Saumur, as she listened to her\nmistress, who was recounting the honors to which she was called.\n\nNevertheless, Monsieur de Bonfons (he had finally abolished his\npatronymic of Cruchot) did not realize any of his ambitious ideas. He\ndied eight days after his election as deputy of Saumur. God, who sees\nall and never strikes amiss, punished him, no doubt, for his sordid\ncalculations and the legal cleverness with which, _accurante Cruchot_,\nhe had drawn up his marriage contract, in which husband and wife gave to\neach other, \"in case they should have no children, their entire property\nof every kind, landed or otherwise, without exception or reservation,\ndispensing even with the formality of an inventory; provided that said\nomission of said inventory shall not injure their heirs and assigns, it\nbeing understood that this deed of gift is, etc., etc.\" This clause\nof the contract will explain the profound respect which monsieur le\npresident always testified for the wishes, and above all, for the\nsolitude of Madame de Bonfons. Women cited him as the most considerate\nand delicate of men, pitied him, and even went so far as to find fault\nwith the passion and grief of Eugenie, blaming her, as women know so\nwell how to blame, with cruel but discreet insinuation.\n\n\"Madame de Bonfons must be very ill to leave her husband entirely alone.\nPoor woman! Is she likely to get well? What is it? Something gastric?\nA cancer?\"--\"She has grown perfectly yellow. She ought to consult some\ncelebrated doctor in Paris.\"--\"How can she be happy without a child?\nThey say she loves her husband; then why not give him an heir?--in\nhis position, too!\"--\"Do you know, it is really dreadful! If it is the\nresult of mere caprice, it is unpardonable. Poor president!\"\n\nEndowed with the delicate perception which a solitary soul acquires\nthrough constant meditation, through the exquisite clear-sightedness\nwith which a mind aloof from life fastens on all that falls within\nits sphere, Eugenie, taught by suffering and by her later education to\ndivine thought, knew well that the president desired her death that he\nmight step into possession of their immense fortune, augmented by the\nproperty of his uncle the notary and his uncle the abbe, whom it had\nlately pleased God to call to himself. The poor solitary pitied\nthe president. Providence avenged her for the calculations and the\nindifference of a husband who respected the hopeless passion on which\nshe spent her life because it was his surest safeguard. To give life to\na child would give death to his hopes,--the hopes of selfishness, the\njoys of ambition, which the president cherished as he looked into the\nfuture.\n\nGod thus flung piles of gold upon this prisoner to whom gold was a\nmatter of indifference, who longed for heaven, who lived, pious and\ngood, in holy thoughts, succoring the unfortunate in secret, and never\nwearying of such deeds. Madame de Bonfons became a widow at thirty-six.\nShe is still beautiful, but with the beauty of a woman who is nearly\nforty years of age. Her face is white and placid and calm; her voice\ngentle and self-possessed; her manners are simple. She has the noblest\nqualities of sorrow, the saintliness of one who has never soiled her\nsoul by contact with the world; but she has also the rigid bearing of\nan old maid and the petty habits inseparable from the narrow round of\nprovincial life. In spite of her vast wealth, she lives as the poor\nEugenie Grandet once lived. The fire is never lighted on her hearth\nuntil the day when her father allowed it to be lighted in the hall, and\nit is put out in conformity with the rules which governed her youthful\nyears. She dresses as her mother dressed. The house in Saumur, without\nsun, without warmth, always in shadow, melancholy, is an image of her\nlife. She carefully accumulates her income, and might seem parsimonious\ndid she not disarm criticism by a noble employment of her wealth. Pious\nand charitable institutions, a hospital for old age, Christian schools\nfor children, a public library richly endowed, bear testimony against\nthe charge of avarice which some persons lay at her door. The churches\nof Saumur owe much of their embellishment to her. Madame de Bonfons\n(sometimes ironically spoken of as mademoiselle) inspires for the most\npart reverential respect: and yet that noble heart, beating only with\ntenderest emotions, has been, from first to last, subjected to the\ncalculations of human selfishness; money has cast its frigid influence\nupon that hallowed life and taught distrust of feelings to a woman who\nis all feeling.\n\n\"I have none but you to love me,\" she says to Nanon.\n\nThe hand of this woman stanches the secret wounds in many families.\nShe goes on her way to heaven attended by a train of benefactions. The\ngrandeur of her soul redeems the narrowness of her education and the\npetty habits of her early life.\n\nSuch is the history of Eugenie Grandet, who is in the world but not of\nit; who, created to be supremely a wife and mother, has neither husband\nnor children nor family. Lately there has been some question of her\nmarrying again. The Saumur people talk of her and of the Marquis de\nFroidfond, whose family are beginning to beset the rich widow just as,\nin former days, the Cruchots laid siege to the rich heiress. Nanon and\nCornoiller are, it is said, in the interests of the marquis. Nothing\ncould be more false. Neither la Grande Nanon nor Cornoiller has\nsufficient mind to understand the corruptions of the world.\n\n\n\n\nADDENDUM\n\nThe following personages appear in other stories of the Human Comedy.\n\n     Chaulieu, Eleonore, Duchesse de\n       Letters of Two Brides\n\n     Grandet, Victor-Ange-Guillaume\n       The Firm of Nucingen\n\n     Grandet, Charles\n       The Firm of Nucingen\n\n     Keller, Francois\n       Domestic Peace\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       The Government Clerks\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Lupeaulx, Clement Chardin des\n       The Muse of the Department\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       The Government Clerks\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Ursule Mirouet\n\n     Nathan, Madame Raoul\n       The Muse of the Department\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       The Government Clerks\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       Ursule Mirouet\n       The Imaginary Mistress\n       A Prince of Bohemia\n       A Daughter of Eve\n       The Unconscious Humorists\n\n     Nucingen, Baronne Delphine de\n       Father Goriot\n       The Thirteen\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       Melmoth Reconciled\n       Lost Illusions\n       A Distinguished Provincial at Paris\n       The Commission in Lunacy\n       Scenes from a Courtesan's Life\n       Modeste Mignon\n       The Firm of Nucingen\n       Another Study of Woman\n       A Daughter of Eve\n       The Member for Arcis\n\n     Roguin\n       Cesar Birotteau\n       Eugenie Grandet\n       A Bachelor's Establishment\n       The Vendetta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Eugenie Grandet, by Honore de Balzac\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK EUGENIE GRANDET ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1715.txt or 1715.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/7\/1\/1715\/\n\nProduced by John Bickers, and Dagny\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":114,"split":"train"}
