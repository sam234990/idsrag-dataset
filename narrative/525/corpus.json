At the hotel croquet court we meet a sickly woman named Louise Maynard and her physician, Dr. Grace Breen. Breen is a graduate of the New York homeopathic school, who has become a doctor to make a difference and prove her worth as a woman. She is cool toward men because the love of her life ran off with her best friend.\nWhen Mr. Libby, an old friend of Mrs. Maynard\u2019s, asks her to go sailing, Dr. Breen insists it will be bad for her health but Mrs. Maynard to goes anyway. The weather takes a turn for the worst and the boat capsizes in the bitter waters. Mrs. Maynard blames Dr. Breen for allowing her to go out into the storm.\nAfter this incident, Mrs. Maynard\u2019s condition worsens and she trusts Dr. Breen even less than she did before. She requests a consultation from a male doctor, so Dr. Breen decides to contact Dr. Rufus Mulbridge, a local allopathic physician.\nMiss Gleason, another women staying at the hotel, insists that Dr. Breen is the best option for Mrs. Maynard, and that if she calls for a consultation from Dr. Mulbridge she will be making it harder for female physicians to act without a man\u2019s assistance. When Dr. Breen arrives at Dr. Mulbridge\u2019s office, the reader sees that while he has an established place of business, she works and lives at a hotel, and while he has many patients, she only treats one woman.\nAfter relinquishing Mrs. Maynard\u2019s case to Dr. Mulbridge, Dr. Breen assumes the role of nurse under his instruction. He diagnoses Mrs. Maynard with pneumonia, Dr. Breen telegraphs Mr. Maynard, who is out in Wyoming working on a ranch, telling him of his wife's condition.\nMr. Libby and Dr. Breen take a boat ride to New Leyden to receive a telegraph from Mr. Maynard. Mr. Libby professes his love for Dr. Breen.\nIn spite of his mother's disdain of the professional woman, Dr. Mulbridge also professes his love for Dr. Breen, and proposes to her. However, since he doesn\u2019t believe in women\u2019s rights or women being able to take men\u2019s positions in the world, and he is a mannerless oaf, Mrs. Mulbridge correctly predicts that she will reject him.\nWhen Mr. Maynard arrives at Jocelyn\u2019s he suggests that Dr. Breen and Mrs. Maynard come out to Wyoming to live with him., where Dr. Breen could have her own practice. However, she decides that she wasted her time training to become a doctor, and that she would rather go to the opera, ballets, and eventually travel to Italy. She professes her love to Mr. Libby, and they walk down the beach in the moonlight together.\nDr. Mulbridge comes back to Jocelyn\u2019s to again ask Dr. Breen to marry him, but she is now an engaged woman. Grace goes on to marry Mr. Libby and they live in southern New Hampshire near his mills. While Mr. Libby works at the mills, Dr. Breen indulges herself by going to plays and shows in Boston, but she also decides to continue practicing medicine.\nIn the end she has what she originally wanted by practicing medicine, and what she came to love, through her marriage to Mr. Libby.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Dr. Breen's Practice, by William Dean Howells\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

BREEN'S PRACTICE.\n\nBy William Dean Howells\n\n1881\n\n\n\n\nI.\n\nNear the verge of a bold promontory stands the hotel, and looks\nsoutheastward over a sweep of sea unbroken to the horizon. Behind it\nstretches the vast forest, which after two hundred years has resumed the\nsterile coast wrested from it by the first Pilgrims, and has begun to\nefface the evidences of the inroad made in recent years by the bold\nspeculator for whom Jocelyn's is named. The young birches and spruces\nare breast high in the drives and avenues at Jocelyn's; the low\nblackberry vines and the sweet fern cover the carefully-graded\nsidewalks, and obscure the divisions of the lots; the children of the\nboarders have found squawberries in the public square on the spot where\nthe band-stand was to have been. The notion of a sea-side resort at\nthis point was courageously conceived, and to a certain extent it was\ngenerously realized. Except for its remoteness from the railroad, a\ndrawback which future enterprise might be expected to remedy in some\nway, the place has many natural advantages. The broad plateau is cooled\nby a breeze from the vast forests behind it, which comes laden with\nhealth and freshness from the young pines; the sea at its feet is warmed\nby the Gulf Stream to a temperature delicious for bathing. There\nare certainly mosquitoes from the woods; but there are mosquitoes\neverywhere, and the report that people have been driven away by them is\nmanifestly untrue, for whoever comes to Jocelyn's remains. The beach at\nthe foot of the bluff is almost a mile at its curve, and it is so smooth\nand hard that it glistens like polished marble when newly washed by the\ntide. It is true that you reach it from the top by a flight of eighty\nsteps, but it was intended to have an elevator, like those near the\nWhirlpool at Niagara. In the mean time it is easy enough to go down, and\nthe ladies go down every day, taking their novels or their needle-work\nwith them. They have various notions of a bath: some conceive that it is\nbathing to sit in the edge of the water, and emit shrieks as the\nsurge sweeps against them; others run boldly in, and after a moment of\npoignant hesitation jump up and down half-a-dozen times, and run out;\nyet others imagine it better to remain immersed to the chin for a given\nspace, looking toward the shore with lips tightly shut and the breath\nheld. But after the bath they are all of one mind; they lay their shawls\non the warm sand, and, spreading out their hair to dry, they doze in the\nsun, in such coils and masses as the unconscious figure lends itself to.\nWhen they rise from their beds, they sit in the shelter of the cliff and\nknit or sew, while one of them reads aloud, and another stands watch to\nannounce the coming of the seals, which frequent a reef near the shore\nin great numbers. It has been said at rival points on the coast that\nthe ladies linger there in despair of ever being able to remount to\nthe hotel. A young man who clambered along the shore from one of those\npoints reported finding day after day the same young lady stretched out\non the same shawl, drying the same yellow hair, who had apparently\nnever gone upstairs since the season began. But the recurrence of this\nphenomenon in this spot at the very moment when the young man came by\nmight have been accounted for upon other theories. Jocelyn's was so\nsecluded that she could not have expected any one to find her there\ntwice, and if she had expected this she would not have permitted it.\nProbably he saw a different young lady each time.\n\nMany of the same boarders come year after year, and these tremble at\nthe suggestion of a change for the better in Jocelyn's. The landlord has\nalways believed that Jocelyn's would come up, some day, when times\ngot better. He believes that the narrow-gauge railroad from New\nLeyden--arrested on paper at the disastrous moment when the fortunes of\nJocelyn's felt the general crash--will be pushed through yet; and\nevery summer he promises that next summer they are going to have a\nsteam-launch running twice a day from Leyden Harbor. But at present his\nhouse is visited once a day by a barge, as the New England coast-folks\ncall the vehicle in which they convey city boarders to and from the\nstation, and the old frequenters of the place hope that the station will\nnever be nearer Jocelyn's than at present. Some of them are rich enough\nto afford a sojourn at more fashionable resorts; but most of them are\nnot, though they are often people of polite tastes and of aesthetic\nemployments. They talk with slight of the large watering-places, and\nprobably they would not like them, though it is really economy that\ninspires their passion for Jocelyn's with most of them, and they know\nof the splendid weariness of Newport mostly by hearsay. New arrivals\nare not favored, but there are not often new arrivals at Jocelyn's. The\nchief business of the barge is to bring fresh meat for the table and\nthe gaunt bag which contains the mail; for in the first flush of\nthe enterprise the place was made a post-office, and the landlord is\npostmaster; he has the help of the lady-boarders in his official duties.\n\nScattered about among the young birches there are several of those\npine frames known as shells, within easy walk of the hotel, where their\ninmates board. They are picturesque interiors, and are on informal terms\nwith the public as to many domestic details. The lady of the house,\ndoing her back hair at her dressing-room glass, is divided from her\nhusband, smoking at the parlor fire-place, only by a partition of\nunlathed studding. The arrest of development in these shells is\ncharacteristic of everything about the place. None of the improvements\ninvented since the hard times began have been added to Jocelyn's;\nlawntennis is still unknown there; but there is a croquet-ground before\nthe hotel, where the short, tough grass is kept in tolerable order. The\nwickets are pretty rusty, and it is usually the children who play; but\ntoward the close of a certain, afternoon a young lady was pushing the\nballs about there. She seemed to be going over a game just played,\nand trying to trace the cause of her failure. She made bad shots, and\nlaughed at her blunders. Another young lady drooped languidly on a\nbench at the side of the croquet-ground, and followed her movements with\nindifference.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see how you did it, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d panted the player; \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's\nastonishing how you beat me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe lady on the bench made as if to answer, but ended by coughing\nhoarsely.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, dear child!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the first, dropping her mallet, and running to\nher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to have put on your shawl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She lifted the knit shawl\nlying beside her on the bench, and laid it across the other's shoulders,\nand drew it close about her neck.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don't!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt chokes me to be bundled up so tight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n She shrugged the shawl down to her shoulders with a pretty petulance.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my chest's protected, that's all that's necessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But she made no\nmotion to drape the outline which her neatly-fitted dress displayed, and\nshe did not move from her place, or look up at her anxious friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, but don't sit here, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the latter pleaded, lingering near\nher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was wrong to let you sit down at all after you had got heated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Grace, I had to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said she who was called Louise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was so tired\nout. I'm not going to take more cold. I can always tell when I am. I'll\nput on the shawl in half a minute; or else I'll go in.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm sure there's nothing to keep me out. That's the worst of these\nlonely places: my mind preys upon itself. That's what Dr. Nixon always\nsaid: he said it was no use in air so long as my mind preyed upon\nitself. He said that I ought to divert my mind all I could, and keep\nit from preying upon itself; that it was worth all the medicine in the\nworld.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's perfectly true.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you ought n't to keep reminding me all the time that I'm sick.\nThat's what starts my mind to preying upon itself; and when it gets\ngoing once I can't stop it. I ought to treat myself just like a well\nperson; that's what the doctor said.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe other stood looking at the speaker in frowning perplexity. She was a\nserious-faced girl, and now when she frowned her black brows met sternly\nabove her gray eyes. But she controlled any impulse she had to severity,\nand asked gently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShall I send Bella to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no! I can't make society out of a child the whole time. I'll just\nsit here till the barge comes in. I suppose it will be as empty as a\ngourd, as usual.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added, with a sick and weary negligence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't\neven know where Bella is. She's run off, somewhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's quite time she should be looked up, for tea. I'll wander out that\nway and look for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She indicated the wilderness generally.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Louise. She now gratefully drew her shawl up over her\nshoulders, and faced about on the bench so as to command an easy view\nof the arriving barge. The other met it on her way to the place in the\nwoods where the children usually played, and found it as empty as her\nfriend had foreboded. But the driver stopped his horses, and leaned out\nof the side of the wagon with a little package in his hand. He read the\nsuperscription, and then glanced consciously at the girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're Miss\nBreen, ain't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with lady-like sweetness and a sort of business-like\nalertness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested the driver, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is for Miss Grace Breen, M. D.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor me, thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm Dr. Breen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She put\nout her hand for the little package from the homoeopathic pharmacy in\nBoston; and the driver yielded it with a blush that reddened him to his\nhair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said slowly, staring at the handsome girl, who did not\nvisibly share his embarrassment, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey told me you was the one; but I\ncould n't seem to get it through me. I thought it must be the old lady.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy mother is Mrs. Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young lady briefly explained, and walked\nrapidly away, leaving the driver stuck in the heavy sand of Sea-Glimpse\nAvenue.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, get up!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted to his horses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGoin' to stay here all day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He craned his neck round the side of the wagon for a sight of her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, dumm 'f I don't wish I was sick! Steps along,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he mused, watching\nthe swirl and ripple of her skirt, \u00e2\u0080\u009clike--I dunno what.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith her face turned from him Dr. Breen blushed, too; she was not yet\nso used to her quality of physician that she could coldly bear the\nconfusion to which her being a doctor put men. She laughed a little to\nherself at the helplessness of the driver, confronted probably for the\nfirst time with a graduate of the New York homoeopathic school; but she\nbelieved that she had reasons for taking herself seriously in every way,\nand she had not entered upon this career without definite purposes. When\nshe was not yet out of her teens, she had an unhappy love affair, which\nwas always darkly referred to as a disappointment by people who knew\nof it at the time. Though the particulars of the case do not directly\nconcern this story, it may be stated that the recreant lover afterwards\nmarried her dearest girl-friend, whom he had first met in her company.\nIt was cruel enough, and the hurt went deep; but it neither crushed nor\nhardened her. It benumbed her for a time; she sank out of sight; but\nwhen she returned to the knowledge of the world she showed no mark of\nthe blow except what was thought a strange eccentricity in a girl such\nas she had been. The world which had known her--it was that of an inland\nNew England city--heard of her definitely after several years as a\nstudent of medicine in New York. Those who had more of her intimacy\nunderstood that she had chosen this work with the intention of giving\nher life to it, in the spirit in which other women enter convents, or\ngo out to heathen lands; but probably this conception had its\nexaggerations. What was certain was that she was rich enough to have\nno need of her profession as a means of support, and that its study\nhad cost her more than the usual suffering that it brings to persons of\nsensitive nerves. Some details were almost insuperably repugnant; but\nin schooling herself to them she believed that she was preparing to\nencounter anything in the application of her science.\n\nHer first intention had been to go back to her own town after her\ngraduation, and begin the practice of her profession among those who had\nalways known her, and whose scrutiny and criticism would be hardest\nto bear, and therefore, as she fancied, the most useful to her in the\nformation of character. But afterwards she relinquished her purpose in\nfavor of a design which she thought would be more useful to others: she\nplanned going to one of the great factory towns, and beginning practice\nthere, in company with an older physician, among the children of the\noperatives. Pending the completion of this arrangement, which was\nwaiting upon the decision of the other lady, she had come to Jocelyn's\nwith her mother, and with Mrs. Maynard, who had arrived from the West,\naimlessly sick and unfriended, just as they were about leaving home.\nThere was no resource but to invite her with them, and Dr. Breen was\nfinding her first patient in this unexpected guest. She did not wholly\nregret the accident; this, too, was useful work, though not that she\nwould have chosen; but her mother, after a fortnight, openly repined,\nand could not mention Mrs. Maynard without some rebellious murmur.\nShe was an old lady, who had once kept a very vigilant conscience for\nherself; but after making her life unhappy with it for some threescore\nyears, she now applied it entirely to the exasperation and condemnation\nof others. She especially devoted it to fretting a New England girl's\nnaturally morbid sense of duty in her daughter, and keeping it in the\nirritation of perpetual self-question. She had never actively opposed\nher studying medicine; that ambition had harmonized very well with\ncertain radical tendencies of her own, and it was at least not marriage,\nwhich she had found tolerable only in its modified form of widowhood;\nbut at every step after the decisive step was taken she was beset with\nmisgivings lest Grace was not fully alive to the grave responsibilities\nof her office, which she accumulated upon the girl in proportion as she\nflung off all responsibilities of her own. She was doubtless deceived\nby that show of calm which sometimes deceived Grace herself, who, in\ntutoring her soul to bear what it had to bear, mistook her tense effort\nfor spiritual repose, and scarcely realized through her tingling nerves\nthe strain she was undergoing. In spite of the bitter experience of\nher life, she was still very ardent in her hopes of usefulness, very\nscornful of distress or discomfort to herself, and a little inclined\nto exact the heroism she was ready to show. She had a child's severe\nmorality, and she had hardly learned to understand that there is much\nevil in the world that does not characterize the perpetrators: she\nheld herself as strictly to account for every word and deed as she held\nothers, and she had an almost passionate desire to meet the consequence\nof her errors; till that was felt, an intolerable doom hung over her.\nShe tried not to be impulsive; that was criminal in one of her calling;\nand she struggled for patience with an endeavor that was largely\nsuccessful.\n\nAs to the effect of her career outside of herself, and of those whom her\nskill was to benefit, she tried to think neither arrogantly nor meanly.\nShe would not entertain the vanity that she was serving what is\ncalled the cause of woman, and she would not assume any duties or\nresponsibilities toward it. She thought men were as good as women;\nat least one man had been no worse than one woman; and it was in no\nrepresentative or exemplary character that she had chosen her course. At\nthe same time that she held these sane opinions, she believed that she\nhad put away the hopes with the pleasures that might once have taken her\nas a young girl. In regard to what had changed the current of her life,\nshe mentally asserted her mere nullity, her absolute non-existence. The\nthought of it no longer rankled, and that interest could never be hers\nagain. If it had not been so much like affectation, and so counter to\nher strong aesthetic instinct, she might have made her dress somehow\nsignificant of her complete abeyance in such matters; but as it was she\nonly studied simplicity, and as we have seen from the impression of the\nbarge-driver she did not finally escape distinction in dress and manner.\nIn fact, she could not have escaped that effect if she would; and it was\none of the indomitable contradictions of her nature that she would not.\n\nWhen she came back to the croquet-ground, leading the little girl by the\nhand, she found Mrs. Maynard no longer alone and no longer sad. She\nwas chatting and laughing with a slim young fellow, whose gay blue eyes\nlooked out of a sunburnt face, and whose straw hat, carried in his hand,\nexposed a closely shaven head. He wore a suit of gray flannel, and Mrs.\nMaynard explained that he was camping on the beach at Birkman's Cove,\nand had come over in the steamer with her when she returned from Europe.\nShe introduced him as Mr. Libby, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Bella, you dirty little\nthing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Libby bowed anxiously to Grace, and turned for refuge to the little\ngirl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHello, Bella!\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cHello!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the child. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRemember me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The child\nput her left hand on that of Grace holding her right, and prettily\npressed her head against the girl's arm in bashful silence. Grace\nsaid some coldly civil words to the young man: without looking at Mrs.\nMaynard, and passed on into the house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't mean that's your doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he scarcely more than whispered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I do,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mrs. Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs n't she too lovely? And she's\njust as good! She used to stand up at school for me, when all the girls\nwere down on me because I was Western. And when I came East, this\ntime, I just went right straight to her house. I knew she could tell\nme exactly what to do. And that's the reason I'm here. I shall always\nrecommend this air to anybody with lung difficulties. It's the greatest\nthing! I'm almost another person. Oh, you need n't look after her, Mr.\nLibby! There's nothing flirtatious about Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard.\n\nThe young man recovered himself from his absentminded stare in the\ndirection Grace had taken, with a frank laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much the better for a\nfellow, I should say!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace handed the little girl over to her nurse, and went to her own\nroom, where she found her mother waiting to go down to tea.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Mrs. Maynard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Breen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOut on the croquet-ground,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the daughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think it would be damp,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested Mrs. Green.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will come in when the tea-bell rings. She wouldn't come in now, if\nI told her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the elder lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfor a person who lets her doctor pay her\nboard, I think 'she's very independent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you would n't speak of that, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't help it, Grace. It's ridiculous,--that's what it is; it's\nridiculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see anything ridiculous in it. A physician need not charge\nanything unless he chooses, or she; and if I choose to make Louise my\nguest here it's quite the same as if she were my guest at home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't like you to have such a guest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Green. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see\nwhat claim she has upon your hospitality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has a double claim upon it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace answered, with a flush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\nis in sickness and in trouble. I don't see how she could have a better\nclaim. Even if she were quite well I should consider the way she\nhad been treated by her husband sufficient, and I should want to do\neverything I could for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should want her to behave herself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen dryly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow behave herself? What do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Grace, with guilty\nheat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know what I mean, Grace. A woman in her position ought to be more\ncircumspect than any other woman, if she wants people to believe that\nher husband treated her badly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe ought n't to blame her for trying to forget her troubles. It's\nessential to her recovery for her to be as cheerful as she can be. I\nknow that she's impulsive, and she's free in her manners with strangers;\nbut I suppose that's her Westernism. She's almost distracted. She was\ncrying half the night, with her troubles, and kept Bella and me both\nawake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Bella with her now?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace admitted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJane's getting her ready to go down with us.\nLouise is talking with a gentleman who came over on the steamer\nwith her; he's camping on the beach near here. I didn't wait to hear\nparticulars.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhen the nurse brought the little girl to their door, Mrs. Green took\none hand and Grace the other, and they led her down to tea. Mrs. Maynard\nwas already at table, and told them all about meeting Mr. Libby abroad.\n\nUntil the present time she and Grace had not seen each other since they\nwere at school together in Southington, where the girl used to hear so\nmuch to the disadvantage of her native section that she would hardly\nhave owned to it if her accent had not found her out. It would have been\npleasanter to befriend another person, but the little Westerner suffered\na veritable persecution, and that was enough to make Grace her friend.\nShortly after she returned home from school she married, in that casual\nand tentative fashion in which so many marriages seem made. Grace had\nheard of her as travelling in Europe with her husband, from whom she was\nnow separated. She reported that he had known Mr. Libby in his bachelor\ndays, and that Mr. Libby had travelled with them. Mr. Maynard appeared\nto have left to Mr. Libby the arrangement of his wife's pleasures, the\nsupervision of her shopping, and the direction of their common journeys\nand sojourns; and it seemed to have been indifferent to him whether his\nfriend was smoking and telling stories with him, or going with his wife\nto the opera, or upon such excursions as he had no taste for. She gave\nthe details of the triangular intimacy with a frank unconsciousness; and\nafter nine o'clock she returned from a moonlight walk on the beach with\nMr. Libby.\n\nGrace sat waiting for her at the little one's bedside, for Bella had\nbeen afraid to go to sleep alone.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow good you are!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Louise, in a grateful under-tone, as she came\nin. She kissed Grace, and choked down a cough with her hand over her\nmouth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLouise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace sternly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthis is shameful! You forget that you are\nmarried, and ill, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I'm ever so much better, to-night. The air's just as dry! And you\nneedn't mind Mr. Libby. He's such an old friend! Besides, I'm sure to\ngain the case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter. Even as a divorced woman, you oughtn't to go on in this\nway.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I would n't, with every one. But it's quite different with Mr.\nLibby. And, besides, I have to keep my mind from preying on itself\nsomehow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nMrs. Maynard sat in the sun on the seaward-looking piazza of the hotel,\nand coughed in the warm air. She told the ladies, as they came out from\nbreakfast, that she was ever so much better generally, but that she\nseemed to have more of that tickling in her throat. Each of them advised\nher for good, and suggested this specific and that; and they all asked\nher what Miss Breen was doing for her cough. Mrs. Maynard replied,\nbetween the paroxysms, that she did not know: it was some kind of\npowders. Then they said they would think she would want to try something\nactive; even those among them who were homoeopathists insinuated a fine\ndistrust of a physician of their own sex. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it's nothing serious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Mrs. Maynard explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's just bronchial. The air will do me more\ngood than anything. I'm keeping out in it all I can.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter they were gone, a queer, gaunt man came and glanced from the\ndoorway at her. He had one eye in unnatural fixity, and the other set at\nthat abnormal slant which is said to qualify the owner for looking round\na corner before he gets to it. A droll twist of his mouth seemed partly\nphysical, but: there is no doubt that he had often a humorous intention.\nIt was Barlow, the man-of-all-work, who killed and plucked the poultry,\npeeled the potatoes and picked the peas, pulled the sweet-corn and\nthe tomatoes, kindled the kitchen fire, harnessed the old splayfooted\nmare,--safe for ladies and children, and intolerable for all others,\nwhich formed the entire stud of the Jocelyn House stables,--dug the\nclams, rowed and sailed the boat, looked after the bath-houses, and came\nin contact with the guests at so many points that he was on easy terms\nwith them all. This ease tended to an intimacy which he was himself\npowerless to repress, and which, from time to time, required their\nintervention. He now wore a simple costume of shirt and trousers, the\nlatter terminated by a pair of broken shoes, and sustained by what he\ncalled a single gallows; his broad-brimmed straw hat scooped down upon\nhis shoulders behind, and in front added to his congenital difficulty of\ngetting people in focus. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you do, this morning, Mrs. Maynard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I'm first-rate, Mr. Barlow. What sort of day do you think it's\ngoing to be for a sail?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarlow came out to the edge of the piazza, and looked at the sea and\nsky. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFirst-rate. Fog's most burnt away now. You don't often see a fog\nat Jocelyn's after ten o'clock in the mornin'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked for approval to Mrs. Maynard, who said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's so. The air's\njust splendid. It 's doing everything for me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's these pine woods, back o' here. Every breath on 'em does ye good.\nIt's the balsam in it. D' you ever try,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, stretching his\nhand as far up the piazza-post as he could, and swinging into a\nconversational posture,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cd' you ever try whiskey--good odd Bourbon\nwhiskey--with white-pine chips in it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Maynard looked up with interest, but, shaking her head, coughed for\nno.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I should like to have you try that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat does it do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she gasped, when she could get her breath.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it's soothin' t' the cough, and it builds ye up, every ways. Why,\nmy brother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued the factotum, \u00e2\u0080\u009che died of consumption when I was\na boy,--reg'lar old New England consumption. Don't hardly ever hear of\nit any more, round here. Well, I don't suppose there's been a case\nof reg'lar old New England consumption--well, not the old New England\nkind--since these woods growed up. He used to take whiskey with\nwhite-pine chips in it; and I can remember hearin 'em say that it done\nhim more good than all the doctor's stuff. He'd been out to Demarary,\nand everywheres, and he come home in the last stages, and took up with\nthis whiskey with whitepine chips in it. Well, it's just like this, I\npresume it's the balsam in the chips. It don't make any difference how\nyou git the balsam into your system, so 's 't you git it there. I should\nlike to have you try whiskey with white-pine chips in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked convincingly at Mrs. Maynard, who said she should like to try\nit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's just bronchial with me, you know. But I should like to try it.\nI know it would be soothing; and I've always heard that whiskey was the\nvery thing to build you up. But,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, lapsing from this vision\nof recovery, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn't take it unless Grace said so. She'd be sure to\nfind it out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, look here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barlow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs far forth as that goes, you could\nkeep the bottle in my room. Not but what I believe in going by your\ndoctor's directions, it don't matter who your doctor is. I ain't sayin'\nnothin' against Miss Breen, you understand?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never see much nicer ladies than her and her mother in the house.\nBut you just tell her about the whiskey with the white-pine chips in\nit. Maybe she never heard of it. Well, she hain't had a great deal of\nexperience yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I think she'll be glad to hear of it.\nYou may be sure I'll tell her, Mr. Barlow. Grace is everything for the\nbalsamic properties of the air, down here. That's what she said; and as\nyou say, it doesn't matter how you get the balsam into your system, so\nyou get it there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the factotum, in a tone of misgiving, as if the repetition of\nthe words presented the theory in a new light to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I think is, and what I'm always telling Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pursued Mrs.\nMaynard, in that confidential spirit in which she helplessly spoke of\nher friends by their first names to every one, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if I could once get\nmy digestion all right, then the cough would stop of itself. The doctor\nsaid--Dr. Nixon, that is--that it was more than half the digestion any\nway. But just as soon as I eat anything--or if I over-eat a little--then\nthat tickling in my throat begins, and then I commence coughing; and I'm\nback just where I was. It's the digestion. I oughtn't to have eaten that\nmince pie, yesterday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d admitted Barlow. Then he said, in indirect defence of the kitchen,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you had n't ought to be out in the night air,--well, not a\ngreat deal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don't suppose it does do me much good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard said,\nturning her eyes seaward.\n\nBarlow let his hand drop from the piazza post, and slouched in-doors;\nbut he came out again as if pricked by conscience to return.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter all, you know, it did n't cure him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat cure him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Maynard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whiskey with the white-pine chips in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCure who?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy brother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Oh, yes! But mine's only bronchial. I think it might do me good. I\nshall tell Grace about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarlow looked troubled, as if his success in the suggestion of this\nremedy were not finally a pleasure; but as Mrs. Maynard kept her eyes\npersistently turned from him, and was evidently tired, he had nothing\nfor it but to go in-doors again. He met Grace, and made way for her on\nthe threshold to pass out.\n\nAs she joined Mrs. Maynard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the latter, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do\nbelieve you are right. I have taken some more cold. But that shows that\nit does n't get worse of itself, and I think we ought to be encouraged\nby that. I'm going to be more careful of the night air after this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think the night air was the worst thing about it, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nGrace bluntly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean the damp from the sand? I put on my rubbers.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't mean the damp sand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, beginning to pull over some\nsewing which she had in her lap, and looking down at it.\n\nMrs. Maynard watched her a while in expectation that she would say more,\nbut she did not speak. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh--well!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she was forced to continue herself,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cif you're going to go on with that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe question is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, getting the thread she wanted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhether\nyou are going on with it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I can't see any possible harm in it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d protested Mrs. Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nsuppose you don't exactly like my going with Mr. Libby, and I know that\nunder some circumstances it would n't be quite the thing. But did n't I\ntell you last night how he lived with us in Europe? And when we were\nall coming over on the steamer together Mr. Libby and Mr. Maynard were\ntogether the whole time, smoking and telling stories. They were the\ngreatest friends! Why, it isn't as if he was a stranger, or an enemy of\nMr. Maynard's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace dropped her sewing into her lap. \u00e2\u0080\u009cReally, Louise, you're\nincredible!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She looked sternly at the invalid; but broke into a laugh,\non which Mrs. Maynard waited with a puzzled face. As Grace said nothing\nmore, she helplessly resumed:--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe did n't expect to go down the cliff when he first called in the\nevening. But he said he would help me up again, and--he did, nicely. I\nwas n't exhausted a bit; and how I took more cold I can't understand; I\nwas wrapped up warmly. I think I took the cold when I was sitting there\nafter our game of croquet, with my shawl off. Don't you think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nwheedled.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe did nothing but talk about you, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard, with a\nsly look at the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's awfully afraid of you, and he kept asking\nabout you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLouise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other, gravely ignoring these facts, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never\nundertook the care of you socially, and I object very much to lecturing\nyou. You are nearly as old as I am, and you have had a great deal more\nexperience of life than I have.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard sighed deeply in assent.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it does n't seem to have taught you that if you will provoke people\nto talk of you, you must expect criticism. One after another you've\ntold nearly every woman in the house your affairs, and they have all\nsympathized with you and pitied you. I shall have to be plain, and tell\nyou that I can't have them sneering and laughing at any one who is my\nguest. I can't let you defy public opinion here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard, buoyed above offence at her friend's\nwords by her consciousness of the point she was about to make, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou defy\npublic opinion yourself a good deal more than I do, every minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? How do I defy it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Grace indignantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy being a doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace opened her lips to speak, but she was not a ready person, and she\nfelt the thrust. Before she could say anything Mrs. Maynard went on:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere isn't one of them that does n't think you're much more scandalous\nthan if you were the greatest flirt alive. But, I don't mind them, and\nwhy should you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe serious girl whom she addressed was in that helpless subjection to\nthe truth in which so many New England women pass their lives. She could\nnot deny the truth which lurked in the exaggeration of these words, and\nit unnerved her, as the fact that she was doing what the vast majority\nof women considered unwomanly always unnerved her when she suffered\nherself to think of it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are right, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said meekly and\nsadly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey think as well of you as they do of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that's just what I said!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, glad of her\nsuccessful argument.\n\nBut however disabled, her friend resumed: \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe only safe way for you is\nto take the ground that so long as you wear your husband's name you must\nhonor it, no matter how cruel and indifferent to you he has been.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d assented Mrs. Maynard ruefully, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof course.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean that you must n't even have the appearance of liking admiration,\nor what you call attentions. It's wicked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the culprit.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been brought up to have such different ideas of divorce from\nwhat I have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I don't feel as if I had any right\nto advise you about what you are to do after you gain your suit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not want to get married again for one while; I know that much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Mrs. Maynard interpolated self-righteously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut till you do gain it, you ought not to regard it as emancipating you\nin the slightest degree.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d came in sad assent from the victim of the law's delays.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I want you to promise me that you won't go walking with Mr. Libby\nany more; and that you won't even see him alone, after this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, but Grace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, as much in amazement as in\nannoyance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't seem to understand! Have n't I told you he was a\nfriend of the family? He's quite as much Mr. Maynard's friend as he is\nmine. I'm sure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif I asked Mr. Libby, I should never think\nof getting divorced. He's all for George; and it's as much as I can do\nto put up with him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo matter. That does n't alter the appearance to people here. I don't\nwish you to go with him alone any more.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Grace, I won't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard earnestly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't, indeed.\nAnd that makes me think: he wanted you to go along this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo go along? Wanted me--What are you talking about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, I suppose that's his boat, out there, now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard pointed\nto a little craft just coming to anchor inside the reef. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe said he\nwanted me to take a sail with him, this morning; and he said he would\ncome up and ask you, too. I do hope you'll go, Grace. It's just as calm;\nand he always has a man with him to help sail the boat, so there is\nn't the least danger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace looked at her in silent sorrow, and Mrs.\nMaynard went on with sympathetic seriousness: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! there's one thing I\nwant to ask you about, Grace: I don't like to have any concealments from\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace did not speak, but she permitted Mrs. Maynard to proceed:\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBarlow recommended it, and he's lived here a great while. His brother\ntook it, and he had the regular old New England consumption. I thought I\nshouldn't like to try it without your knowing it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTry it? What are you talking about, Louise?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, whiskey with white-pine chips in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace rose, and moved towards the door, with the things dropping from\nher lap. One of these was a spool, that rolled down the steps and out\nupon the sandy road. She turned to pursue it, and recovered it at the\ncost of dropping her scissors and thimble out of opposite sides of her\nskirt, which she had gathered up apronwise to hold her work. When she\nrose from the complicated difficulty, in which Mrs. Maynard had amiably\nlent her aid, she confronted Mr. Libby, who was coming towards them from\nthe cliff. She gave him a stiff nod, and attempted to move away; but in\nturning round and about she had spun herself into the folds of a stout\nlinen thread escaping from its spool. These gyves not only bound her\nskirts but involved her feet in an extraordinary mesh, which tightened\nat the first step and brought her to a standstill.\n\nMrs. Maynard began to laugh and cough, as Mr. Libby came to her friend's\nhelp. He got the spool in his hand, and walked around her in the\nendeavor to free her; but in vain. She extended him the scissors with\nthe stern passivity of a fate. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCut it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she commanded, and Mr. Libby\nknelt before her and obeyed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, taking back the\nscissors; and now she sat down again, and began deliberately to put up\nher work in her handkerchief.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'll go out and get my things. I won't be gone half a minute, Mr.\nLibby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard, with her first breath, as she vanished\nindoors.\n\nMr. Libby leaned against the post lately occupied by the factotum in his\ntalk with Mrs. Maynard, and looked down at Grace as she bent over\nher work. If he wished to speak to her, and was wavering as to the\nappropriate style of address for a handsome girl, who was at once a\nyoung lady and a physician, she spared him the agony of a decision by\nlooking up at him suddenly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he faltered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you feel like a sail, this morning? Did\nMrs. Maynard--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall have to excuse myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace, with a conscience\nagainst saying she was sorry. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am a very bad sailor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, so am I, for that matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it's smooth as a\npond, to-day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace made no direct response, and he grew visibly uncomfortable under\nthe cold abstraction of the gaze with which she seemed to look through\nhim. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs. Maynard tells me you came over with her from Europe.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the young man, the light of pleasant recollection\nkindling in his gay eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe had a good time. Maynard was along: he's a\nfirst-rate fellow. I wish he were here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish so, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She did not know what to make\nof this frankness of the young man's, and she did not know whether\nto consider him very depraved or very innocent. In her question she\ncontinued to stare at him, without being aware of the embarrassment to\nwhich she was putting him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard of Mrs. Maynard's being here, and I thought I should find him,\ntoo. I came over yesterday to get him to go into the woods with us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace decided that this was mere effrontery. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is a pity that he is\nnot here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; and though it ought to have been possible for her\nto go on and rebuke the young fellow for bestowing upon Mrs. Maynard the\ncomradeship intended for her husband, it was not so. She could only look\nseverely at him, and trust that he might conceive the intention which\nshe could not express. She rebelled against the convention and against\nher own weakness, which would not let her boldly interfere in what she\nbelieved a wrong; she had defied society, in the mass, but here, with\nthis man, whom as an atom of the mass she would have despised, she was\npowerless.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you ever seen him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Libby asked, perhaps clinging to Maynard\nbecause he was a topic of conversation in default of which there might\nbe nothing to say.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe 's funny. He's got lots of that Western humor, and he tells a story\nbetter than any man I ever saw. There was one story of his\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no sense of humor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted Grace impatiently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she broke out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm sorry that you've asked Mrs. Maynard to take a sail\nwith you. The sea air\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she reddened with the shame of not being able to\nproceed without this wretched subterfuge--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwon't do her any good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must n't let her go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't choose to forbid her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he broke in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll be back in a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned, and ran to the edge of the cliff, over which he vanished, and\nhe did not reappear till Mrs. Maynard had rejoined Grace on the piazza.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you won't mind its being a little rough, Mrs. Maynard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nbreathing quickly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdams thinks we're going to have it pretty fresh\nbefore we get back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed, I don't want to go, then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, in petulant\ndisappointment, letting her wraps fall upon a chair.\n\nMr. Libby looked at Grace, who haughtily rejected a part in the\nconspiracy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you to go, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she declared indignantly.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take the risk of all the harm that comes to you from the bad\nweather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She picked up the shawls, and handed them to Mr. Libby, on\nwhom her eyes blazed their contempt and wonder. It cost a great deal of\npersuasion and insistence now to make Mrs. Maynard go, and he left all\nthis to Grace, not uttering a word till he gave Mrs. Maynard his hand to\nhelp her down the steps. Then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I wonder what Miss Breen\ndoes want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm sure I don't know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt first she did n't want me\nto go, this morning, and now she makes me. I do hope it is n't going to\nbe a storm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't believe it is. A little fresh, perhaps. I thought you might be\nseasick.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you remember? I'm never seasick! That's one of the worst signs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I could be thoroughly seasick once, it would be the best thing I\ncould do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs she capricious?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mr. Libby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, releasing her hand half-way down the steps,\nin order to enjoy her astonishment without limitation of any sort.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGrace capricious!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Libby, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat's what I thought. Better take my hand\nagain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and he secured that of Mrs. Maynard, who continued her descent.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose I don't understand her exactly. Perhaps she did n't like\nmy not calling her Doctor. I did n't call her anything. I suppose she\nthought I was dodging it. I was. I should have had to call her Miss\nBreen, if I called her anything.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wouldn't have cared. She is n't a doctor for the name of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you think it's a pity?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer being a doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll tell her you say so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, don't. But don't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I would n't want to be one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Mayward candidly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose it's all right, if she does it from a sense of duty, as you\nsay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, she's all right. And she's just as much of a girl as anybody;\nthough she don't know it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard added astutely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy would n't\nshe come with us? Were you afraid to ask her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe said she was n't a good sailor. Perhaps she thought we were too\nyoung. She must be older than you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, and you, too!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, with good-natured derision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe doesn't look old,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Mr. Libby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's twenty-eight. How old are you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI promised the census-taker not to tell till his report came out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the color of her hair?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBrown.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd her eyes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had better look out, Mr. Libby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard, putting her\nfoot on the ground at last.\n\nThey walked across the beach to where his dory lay, and Grace saw him\npulling out to the sail boat before she went in from the piazza. Then\nshe went to her mother's room. The elderly lady was keeping indoors,\nupon a theory that the dew was on, and that it was not wholesome to go\nout till it was off. She asked, according to her habit when she met her\ndaughter alone, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Mrs. Maynard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy do you always ask that, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d retorted Grace, with her growing\nirritation in regard to her patient intensified by the recent interview.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't be with her the whole time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you could,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen, with noncommittal suggestion.\n\nGrace could not keep herself from demanding, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d as her mother\nexpected, though she knew why too well.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause she wouldn't be in mischief then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Mrs. Breen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's in mischief now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the girl vehemently; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand it's my fault!\nI did it. I sent her off to sail with that ridiculous Mr. Libby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Breen, in her turn, with unbroken tranquillity.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I am a fool, and I couldn't help him lie out of his engagement\nwith her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid n't he want to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know. Yes. They both wanted me to go with them. Simpletons!\nAnd while she had gone up-stairs for her wraps I managed to make him\nunderstand that I did n't wish her to go, either; and he ran down to his\nboat, and came back with a story about its going to be rough, and looked\nat me perfectly delighted, as if I should be pleased. Of course, then, I\nmade him take her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is n't it going to be rough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Green.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, mother, the sea's like glass.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Breen turned the subject. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would have done better, Grace,\nto begin as you had planned. Your going to Fall River, and beginning\npractice there among those factory children, was the only thing that I\never entirely liked in your taking up medicine. There was sense in that.\nYou had studied specially for it. You could have done good there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed the girl, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know. But what was I to do, when she came\nto us, sick and poor? I couldn't turn my back on her, especially after\nalways befriending her, as I used to, at school, and getting her to\ndepend on me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see how you ever liked her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never did like her. I pitied her. I always thought her a poor, flimsy\nlittle thing. But that ought n't to make any difference, if she was in\ntrouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Breen conceded, and in compensation Grace admitted something\nmore on her side: \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's worse than she used to be,--sillier. I don't\nsuppose she has a wrong thought; but she's as light as foam.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it is n't the wicked people who, do the harm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Green.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was sure that this air would be everything for her; and so it would,\nwith any ordinary case. But a child would take better care of itself. I\nhave to watch her every minute, like a child; and I never know what she\nwill do next.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; it's a burden,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen, with a sympathy which she had\nnot expressed before. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you're a good girl, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added in very\nunwonted recognition.\n\nThe grateful tears stole into the daughter's eyes, but she kept a firm\nface, even after they began to follow one another down her cheeks. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nif Louise had n't come, you know, mother, that I was anxious to have\nsome older person with me when I went to Fall River. I was glad to have\nthis respite; it gives me a chance to think. I felt a little timid about\nbeginning alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA man would n't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Breen remarked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I am not a man. I have accepted that; with all the rest. I don't\nrebel against being a woman. If I had been a man, I should n't have\nstudied medicine. You know that. I wished to be a physician because I\nwas a woman, and because--because--I had failed where--other women's\nhopes are.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She said it out firmly, and her mother softened to her in\nproportion to the girl's own strength. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have been just a nurse.\nYou know I should have been willing to be that, but I thought I could be\nsomething more. But it's no use talking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She added, after an interval,\nin which her mother rocked to and fro with a gentle motion that searched\nthe joints of her chair, and brought out its most plaintive squeak\nin pathetic iteration, and watched Grace, as she sat looking seaward\nthrough the open window, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it's rather hard, mother, that you\nshould be always talking as if I wished to take my calling mannishly.\nAll that I intend is not to take it womanishly; but as for not being a\nwoman about it, or about anything, that's simply impossible. A woman is\nreminded of her insufficiency to herself every hour of the day. And it's\nalways a man that comes to her help. I dropped some things out of my lap\ndown there, and by the time I had gathered them up I was wound round and\nround with linen thread so that I could n't move a step, and Mr. Libby\ncut me loose. I could have done it myself, but it seemed right and\nnatural that he should do it. I dare say he plumed himself upon his\nservice to me,--that would be natural, too. I have things enough to keep\nme meek, mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not look round at Mrs. Breen, who said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you are morbid\nabout it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. And I have the satisfaction of knowing that whatever people think\nof Louise's giddiness, I'm, a great deal more scandalous to them than\nshe is simply because I wish to do some good in the world, in a way that\nwomen have n't done it, usually.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow you are morbid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes! Talk about men being obstacles! It's other women! There isn't\na woman in the house that would n't sooner trust herself in the hands of\nthe stupidest boy that got his diploma with me than she would in mine.\nLouise knows it, and she feels that she has a claim upon me in being my\npatient. And I 've no influence with her about her conduct because she\nunderstands perfectly well that they all consider me much worse. She\nprides herself on doing me justice. She patronizes me. She tells me that\nI'm just as nice as, if I hadn't 'been through all that.'\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace rose,\nand a laugh, which was half a sob, broke from her.\n\nMrs. Breen could not feel the humor of the predicament. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe puts you in\na false position.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must go and see where that poor little wretch of a child is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nGrace, going out of the room. She returned in an hour, and asked her\nmother for the arnica. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBella has had a bump,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, have you been all this time looking for her?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I couldn't find her, and I've been reading. Barlow has just brought\nher in. HE could find her. She fell out of a tree, and she's frightfully\nbruised.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was making search on a closet shelf as she talked. When she\nreappeared with the bottle in her hand, her mother asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs n't it\nvery hot and close?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should certainly think they would perish,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen, hazarding\nthe pronoun, with a woman's confidence that her interlocutor would apply\nit correctly.\n\nWhen Grace had seen Bella properly bathed and brown-papered, and in\nthe way to forgetfulness of her wounds in sleep, she came down to the\npiazza, and stood looking out to sea. The ladies appeared one by one\nover the edge of the cliff, and came up, languidly stringing their\nshawls after them, or clasping their novels to their bosoms.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere isn't a breath down there,\u00e2\u0080\u009d they said, one after another. The\nlast one added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarlow says it's the hottest day he's ever seen here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn a minute Barlow himself appeared at the head of the steps with the\nladies' remaining wraps, and confirmed their report in person. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, wiping his forehead, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's a ripper.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be an awful day in town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the ladies, fanning\nherself with a newspaper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that to-day's Advertiser, Mrs. Alger?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, dear, no! yesterday's. We sha'n't have today's till this afternoon.\nIt shows what a new arrival you are, Mrs. Scott--your asking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo be sure. But it's such a comfort being where you can see the\nAdvertiser the same morning. I always look at the Weather Report the\nfirst thing. I like to know what the weather is going to be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can't at Jocelyn's. You can only know what it's been.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Barlow interposed, jealous for Jocelyn's, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can most al'ays\ntell by the look o' things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the ladies; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I'd rather trust the Weather Report.\nIt's wonderful how it comes true. I don't think there 's anything that\nyou miss more in Europe than our American Weather Report.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm sure you miss the oysters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the first admitted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou do miss the oysters. It was the last of\nthe R months when we landed in New York; and do you know what we did the\nfirst thing--? We drove to Fulton Market, and had one of those Fulton\nMarket broils! My husband said we should have had it if it had been\nJuly. He used to dream of the American oysters when we were in Europe.\nGentlemen are so fond of them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarlow, from scanning the heavens, turned round and faced the company,\nwhich had drooped in several attitudes of exhaustion on the benching of\nthe piazza. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I can most al'ays tell about Jocelyn's as good as the\nWeather Report. I told Mrs. Maynard here this mornin' that the fog was\ngoin' to burn off.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBurn off?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Alger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think it had!\u00e2\u0080\u009d The other ladies\nlaughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you'll see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d added Barlow, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the wind 'll change at noon, and\nwe'll have it cooler.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it's as hot on the water as it is here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Scott, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should\nthink those people would get a sunstroke.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, so should I, Mrs. Scott,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cordially exclaimed a little fat\nlady, as if here at last were an opinion in which all might rejoice to\nsympathize.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's never so hot on the water, Mrs. Merritt,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger, with\nthe instructiveness of an old habitude.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, not at Jocelyn's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested Barlow. Mrs. Alger stopped fanning\nherself with her newspaper, and looked at him. Upon her motion, the\nother ladies looked at Barlow. Doubtless he felt that his social\nacceptability had ceased with his immediate usefulness. But he appeared\nresolved to carry it off easily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose I must go\nand pick my peas.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo one said anything to this. When the factotum had disappeared round\nthe corner of the house, Mrs. Alger turned her head' aside, and glanced\ndownward with an air of fatigue. In this manner Barlow was dismissed\nfrom the ladies' minds.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said young Mrs. Scott, with a deferential glance at Grace,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat the sun is good for a person with lung-difficulty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace silently refused to consider herself appealed to, and Mrs. Merritt\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetter than the moon, I should think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome of the others tittered, but Grace looked up at Mrs. Merritt and\nsaid, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think Mrs. Maynard's case is so bad that she need be\nafraid of either.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am so glad to hear it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the other. She looked round, but\nwas unable to form a party. By twos or threes they might have liked to\ntake Mrs. Maynard to pieces; but no one cares to make unkind remarks\nbefore a whole company of people. Some of the ladies even began to say\npleasant things about Mr. Libby, as if he were Grace's friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI always like to see these fair men when they get tanned,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs.\nAlger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir blue eyes look so very blue. And the backs of their\nnecks--just like my boys!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you admire such a VERY fighting-clip as Mr. Libby has on?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked\nMrs. Scott.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt must be nice for summer,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the elder lady.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it certainly must,\u00e2\u0080\u009d admitted the younger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said another, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could go in the fighting-clip. One\ndoes n't know what to do with one's hair at the sea-side; it's always in\nthe way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour hair would be a public loss, Mrs. Frost,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger. The\nothers looked at her hair, as if they had seen it now for the first\ntime.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I don't think so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Frost, in a sort of flattered coo.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don't have it cut off!\u00e2\u0080\u009d pleaded a young girl, coming up and taking\nthe beautiful mane, hanging loose after the bath, into her hand. Mrs.\nFrost put her arm round the girl's waist, and pulled her down against\nher shoulder. Upon reflection she also kissed her.\n\nThrough a superstition, handed down from mother to daughter, that it\nis uncivil and even unkind not to keep saying something, they went on\ntalking vapidities, where the same number of men, equally vacuous,\nwould have remained silent; and some of them complained that the nervous\nstrain of conversation took away all the good their bath had done them.\nMiss Gleason, who did not bathe, was also not a talker. She kept a\nbright-eyed reticence, but was apt to break out in rather enigmatical\nflashes, which resolved the matter in hand into an abstraction, and left\nthe others with the feeling that she was a person of advanced ideas, but\nthat, while rejecting historical Christianity, she believed in a God of\nLove. This Deity was said, upon closer analysis, to have proved to be\na God of Sentiment, and Miss Gleason was herself a hero-worshiper, or,\nmore strictly speaking, a heroine-worshiper. At present Dr. Breen was\nher cult, and she was apt to lie in wait for her idol, to beam upon\nit with her suggestive eyes, and evidently to expect it to say or do\nsomething remarkable, but not to suffer anything like disillusion or\ndisappointment in any event. She would sometimes offer it suddenly a\nmuddled depth of sympathy in such phrases as, \u00e2\u0080\u009cToo bad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d or, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't\nsee how you keep-up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and darkly insinuate that she appreciated all\nthat Grace was doing. She seemed to rejoice in keeping herself at a\nrespectful distance, to which she breathlessly retired, as she did now,\nafter waylaying her at the top of the stairs, and confidentially darting\nat her the words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm so glad you don't like scandal!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nAfter dinner the ladies tried to get a nap, but such of them as\nre-appeared on the piazza later agreed that it was perfectly useless.\nThey tested every corner for a breeze, but the wind had fallen dead, and\nthe vast sweep of sea seemed to smoulder under the sun. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is what\nMr. Barlow calls having it cooler,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are some clouds that look like thunderheads in the west,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMrs. Frost, returning from an excursion to the part of the piazza\ncommanding that quarter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it won't rain to-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Alger decided.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought there was always a breeze at Jocelyn's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Scott observed,\nin the critical spirit of a recent arrival.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere always is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the other explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cexcept the first week you're\nhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA little breath, scarcely more than a sentiment of breeze, made itself\nfelt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI do believe the wind has changed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Frost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's east.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n The others owned one by one that it was so, and she enjoyed the merit\nof a discoverer; but her discovery was rapidly superseded. The clouds\nmounted in the west, and there came a time when the ladies disputed\nwhether they had heard thunder or not: a faction contended for the\nbowling alley, and another faction held for a wagon passing over the\nbridge just before you reached Jocelyn's. But those who were faithful to\nthe theory of thunder carried the day by a sudden crash that broke over\nthe forest, and, dying slowly away among the low hills, left them deeply\nsilent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSome one,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger, \u00e2\u0080\u009cought to go for those children.\u00e2\u0080\u009d On\nthis it appeared that there were two minds as to where the children\nwere,--whether on the beach or in the woods.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas n't that thunder, Grace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Breen, with the accent by\nwhich she implicated her daughter in whatever happened.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, from where she sat at her window, looking seaward,\nand waiting tremulously for her mother's next question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is Mrs. Maynard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is n't back, yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen, \u00e2\u0080\u009che really did expect rough weather.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe must,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Grace, in a guilty whisper.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's a pity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d remarked her mother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you made them go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She rose, and, stretching herself far out of the window, searched\nthe inexorable expanse of sea. It had already darkened at the verge, and\nthe sails of some fishing-craft flecked a livid wall with their white,\nbut there was no small boat in sight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf anything happened to them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d her mother continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should feel\nterribly for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should feel terribly for myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace responded, with her eyes\nstill seaward.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere do you think they went?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't ask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, in devotion to\nthe whole truth.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it is all of the same piece,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen. Grace did not ask\nwhat the piece was. She remained staring at the dark wall across the\nsea, and spiritually confronting her own responsibility, no atom of\nwhich she rejected. She held herself in every way responsible,--for\ndoubting that poor young fellow's word, and then for forcing that\nreluctant creature to go with him, and forbidding by her fierce\ninsistence any attempt of his at explanation; she condemned herself\nto perpetual remorse with even greater zeal than her mother would have\nsentenced her, and she would not permit herself any respite when a\nlittle sail, which she knew for theirs, blew round the point. It seemed\nto fly along just on the hither side of that mural darkness, skilfully\ntacking to reach the end of the-reef before the wall pushed it on the\nrocks. Suddenly, the long low stretch of the reef broke into white\nfoam, and then passed from sight under the black wall, against which\nthe little sail still flickered. The girl fetched a long, silent breath.\nThey were inside the reef, in comparatively smooth water, and to her\nignorance they were safe. But the rain would be coming in another\nmoment, and Mrs. Maynard would be drenched; and Grace would be to blame\nfor her death. She ran to the closet, and pulled down her mother's\nIndia-rubber cloak and her own, and fled out-of-doors, to be ready on\nthe beach with the wrap, against their landing. She met the other ladies\non the stairs and in the hall, and they clamored at her; but she glided\nthrough them like something in a dream, and then she heard a shouting in\nher ear, and felt herself caught and held up against the wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere in land be you goin', Miss Breen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarlow, in a long, yellow oil-skin coat and sou'wester hat, kept pushing\nher forward to the edge of the cliff, as he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm going down to meet them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she screamed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I hope you WILL meet 'em. But I guess you better go back to the\nhouse. Hey? WUNT? Well; come along, then, if they ain't past doctorin'\nby the time they git ashore! Pretty well wrapped up, any way!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nroared; and she perceived that she had put on her waterproof and drawn\nthe hood over her head.\n\nThose steps to the beach had made her giddy when she descended with\nleisure for such dismay; but now, with the tempest flattening her\nagainst the stair-case, and her gossamer clutching and clinging to every\nsurface, and again twisting itself about her limbs, she clambered down\nas swiftly and recklessly as Barlow himself, and followed over the beach\nbeside the men who were pulling a boat down the sand at a run.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLet me get in!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she screamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to go with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTake hold of the girl, Barlow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d shouted one of the men. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's crazy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe tumbled himself with four others into the boat, and they all struck\nout together through the froth and swirl of the waves. She tried to free\nherself from Barlow, so as to fling the waterproof into the boat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTake\nthis, then. She'll be soaked through!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarlow broke into a grim laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe won't need it, except for a\nwindin'-sheet!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he roared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you see the boat's drivin' right on t'\nthe sand? She'll be kindlin' wood in a minute.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they're inside the reef! They can come to anchor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she shrieked in\nreply. He answered her with a despairing grin and a shake of the head.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey can't. What has your boat gone out for, then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo pick 'em up out the sea. But they'll never git 'em alive. Look how\nshe slaps her boom int' the water! Well! He DOES know how to handle a\nboat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was Libby at the helm, as she could dimly see, but what it was in\nhis management that moved Barlow's praise she could not divine. The boat\nseemed to be aimed for the shore, and to be rushing, head on, upon the\nbeach; her broad sail was blown straight out over her bow, and flapped\nthere like a banner, while the heavy boom hammered the water as she\nrose and fell. A jagged line of red seamed the breast of the dark wall\nbehind; a rending crash came, and as if fired upon, the boat flung up\nher sail, as a wild fowl flings up its wing when shot, and lay tossing\nkeel up, on the top of the waves. It all looked scarcely a stone's cast\naway, though it was vastly farther. A figure was seen to drag itself up\nout of the sea, and fall over into the boat, hovering and pitching\nin the surrounding welter, and struggling to get at two other figures\nclinging to the wreck. Suddenly the men in the boat pulled away, and\nGrace uttered a cry of despair and reproach: \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, they're leaving it,\nthey're leaving it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't expect 'em to tow the wreck ashore in this weather, do ye?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n shouted Barlow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey've got the folks all safe enough. I tell ye I see\n'em!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, at a wild look of doubt in her eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cRun to the house,\nthere, and get everything in apple-pie order. There's goin' to be a\nchance for some of your doctor'n' now, if ye know how to fetch folks\nto.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was the little house on the beach, which the children were always\nprying and peering into, trying the lock, and wondering what the boat\nwas like, which Grace had seen launched. Now the door yielded to her,\nand within she found a fire kindled in the stove, blankets laid in\norder, and flasks of brandy in readiness in the cupboard. She put\nthe blankets to heat for instant use, and prepared for the work of\nresuscitation. When she could turn from them to the door, she met there\na procession that approached with difficulty, heads down and hustled by\nthe furious blast through which the rain now hissed and shot. Barlow and\none of the boat's crew were carrying Mrs. Maynard, and bringing up the\nrear of the huddling oil-skins and sou'westers came Libby, soaked, and\ndripping as he walked. His eyes and Grace's encountered with a mutual\navoidance; but whatever was their sense of blame, their victim had no\nreproaches to make herself. She was not in need of restoration. She was\nperfectly alive, and apparently stimulated by her escape from deadly\nperil to a vivid conception of the wrong that had been done her. If the\nadventure had passed off prosperously, she was the sort of woman to have\nowned to her friend that she ought not to have thought of going. But\nthe event had obliterated these scruples, and she realized herself as a\nhapless creature who had been thrust on to dangers from which she would\nhave shrunk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, Grace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, with a voice and look before\nwhich the other quailed, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you are satisfied! All the time I was\nclinging to that wretched boat. I was wondering how you would feel. Yes,\nmy last thoughts were of you. I pitied you. I did n't see how you could\never have peace again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHold on, Mrs. Maynard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's no, time for that, now.\nWhat had best be done, Miss Green? Had n't she better be got up to the\nhouse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, by all means,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou might as well let me die here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard protested, as Grace\nwrapped the blankets round her dripping dress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm as wet as I can be,\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLibby began to laugh at these inconsequences, to which he was probably\nwell used. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would n't have time to die here. And we want to give\nthis hydropathic treatment a fair trial. You've tried the douche, and\nnow you're to have the pack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He summoned two of the boatmen, who had\nbeen considerately dripping outside, in order to leave the interior to\nthe shipwrecked company, and they lifted Mrs. Maynard, finally wrapped\nin, Grace's India-rubber cloak, and looking like some sort of strange,\nhuge chrysalis, and carried her out into the storm and up the steps.\n\nGrace followed last with Mr. Libby, very heavyhearted and reckless. She\nhad not only that sore self-accusal; but the degradation of the affair,\nits grotesqueness, its spiritual squalor, its utter gracelessness, its\nentire want of dignity, were bitter as death in her proud soul. It was\nnot in this shameful guise that she had foreseen the good she was to do.\nAnd it had all come through her own wilfulness and self-righteousness.\nThe tears could mix unseen with the rain that drenched her face, but\nthey blinded her, and half-way up the steps she stumbled on her skirt,\nand would have fallen, if the young man had not caught her. After that,\nfrom time to time he put his arm about her, and stayed her against the\ngusts.\n\nBefore they reached the top he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Breen, I'm awfully sorry for\nall this. Mrs. Maynard will be ashamed of what she said. Confound it! If\nMaynard were only here!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy should she be ashamed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she had been drowned,\nI should have murdered her, and I'm responsible if anything happens to\nher,--I am to blame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She escaped from him, and ran into the house. He\nslunk round the piazza to the kitchen door, under the eyes of the ladies\nwatching at the parlor windows.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder he let the others carry her up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Gleason. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf\ncourse, he will marry her now,--when she gets her divorce.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She spoke\nof Mrs. Maynard, whom her universal toleration not only included in the\nmercy which the opinions of the other ladies denied her, but round\nwhom her romance cast a halo of pretty possibilities as innocently\nsentimental as the hopes of a young girl.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nThe next morning Grace was sitting beside her patient, with whom she\nhad spent the night. It was possibly Mrs. Maynard's spiritual toughness\nwhich availed her, for she did not seem much the worse for her\nadventure: she had a little fever, and she was slightly hoarser; but she\nhad died none of the deaths that she projected during the watches of the\nnight, and for which she had chastened the spirit of her physician\nby the repeated assurance that she forgave her everything, and George\nMaynard everything, and hoped that they would be good to her poor little\nBella. She had the child brought from its crib to her own bed, and\nmoaned over it; but with the return of day and the duties of life she\nappeared to feel that she had carried her forgiveness far enough, and\nwas again remembering her injuries against Grace, as she lay in her\nmorning gown on the lounge which had been brought in for her from the\nparlor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Grace, I shall always say if I had died and I may die yet--that I\ndid not wish to go out with Mr. Libby, and that I went purely to please\nyou. You forced me to go. I can't understand why you did it; for I don't\nsuppose you wanted to kill us, whatever you did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace could not lift her head. She bowed it over the little girl whom\nshe had on her knee, and who was playing with the pin at her throat,\nin apparent unconsciousness of all that was said. But she had really\nfollowed it, with glimpses of intelligence, as children do, and now at\nthis negative accusal she lifted her hand, and suddenly struck Grace a\nstinging blow on the cheek.\n\nMrs. Maynard sprang from her lounge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, Bella! you worthless little\nwretch!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She caught her from Grace's knee, and shook her violently.\nThen, casting the culprit from her at random, she flung herself\ndown again in a fit of coughing, while the child fled to Grace for\nconsolation, and, wildly sobbing, buried her face in the lap of her\ninjured friend.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know what I shall do about that child!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has George Maynard's temper right over again. I feel dreadfully,\nGrace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, never mind it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, fondling the child, and half addressing\nit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose Bella thought I had been unkind to her mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's just it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Louise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen you've been kindness itself!\nDon't I owe everything to you? I should n't be alive at this moment if\nit were not for your treatment. Oh, Grace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She began to cough again;\nthe paroxysm increased in vehemence. She caught her handkerchief\nfrom her lips; it was spotted with blood. She sprang to her feet, and\nregarded it with impersonal sternness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sick, and\nI want a doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace meekly echoed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I can't be trifled with any longer. I want a man doctor!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace had looked at the handkerchief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with\ncoldness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not stand in your way of calling another physician.\nBut if it will console you, I can tell you that the blood on your\nhandkerchief means nothing worth speaking of. Whom shall I send for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she asked, turning to go out of the roam. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to be your friend\nstill, and I will do anything I can to help you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Grace Breen! Is that the way you talk to me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d whimpered Mrs.\nMaynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that I don't mean to give you up. I'm not a stone;\nI have some feeling. I did n't intend to dismiss you, but I thought\nperhaps you would like to have a consultation about it. I should think\nit was time to have a consultation, should n't you? Of course, I'm\nnot alarmed, but I know it's getting serious, and I'm afraid that your\nmedicine is n't active enough. That's it; it's perfectly good medicine,\nbut it is n't active. They've all been saying that I ought to have\nsomething active. Why not try the whiskey with the white-pine chips in\nit? I'm sure it's indicated.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In her long course of medication she had\npicked up certain professional phrases, which she used with amusing\nseriousness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be active, at any rate.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace did not reply. As she stood smoothing the head of the little girl,\nwho had followed her to the door, and now leaned against her, hiding\nher tearful face in Grace's dress, she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know of any\nhomoeopathic physician in this neighborhood. I don't believe there's one\nnearer than Boston, and I should make myself ridiculous in calling one\nso far for a consultation. But I'm quite willing you should call one,\nand I will send for you at once.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd wouldn't you consult with him, after he came?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly not. It would be absurd.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't like to have a doctor come all the way from Boston,\u00e2\u0080\u009d mused\nMrs. Maynard, sinking on the lounge again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere must be a doctor in\nthe neighborhood. It can't be so healthy as that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's an allopathic physician at Corbitant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace passively. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA\nvery good one, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, well, then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, with immense relief. \u00e2\u0080\u009cConsult with\nhim!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've told you, Louise, that I would not consult with anybody. And I\ncertainly wouldn't consult with a physician whose ideas and principles I\nknew nothing about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy but, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard expostulated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs n't that rather\nprejudiced?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She began to take an impartial interest in Grace's\nposition, and fell into an argumentative tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf two heads are\nbetter than one,--and everybody says they are,--I don't see how you can\nconsistently refuse to talk with another physician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't explain to you, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you can call Dr.\nMulbridge, if you wish. That will be the right way for you to do, if you\nhave lost confidence in me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have n't lost confidence in you, Grace. I don't see how you can talk\nso. You can give me bread pills, if you like, or air pills, and I will\ntake them gladly. I believe in you perfectly. But I do think that in a\nmatter of this kind, where my health, and perhaps my life, is\nconcerned, I ought to have a little say. I don't ask you to give up your\nprinciples, and I don't dream of giving you up, and yet you won't just\nto please me!--exchange a few words with another doctor about my case,\nmerely because he's allopathic. I should call it bigotry, and I don't\nsee how you can call it anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was a sound of voices at\nthe door outside, and she called cheerily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome in, Mr. Libby,--come\nin! There's nobody but Grace here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, as the young man\ntentatively opened the door, and looked in. He wore an evening dress,\neven to the white cravat, and he carried in his hand a crush hat:\nthere was something anomalous in his appearance, beyond the phenomenal\ncharacter of his costume, and he blushed consciously as he bowed to\nGrace, and then at her motion shook hands with her. Mrs. Maynard did not\ngive herself the fatigue of rising; she stretched her hand to him from\nthe lounge, and he took it without the joy which he had shown when Grace\nmade him the same advance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow very swell you look. Going to an evening\nparty this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried; and after she had given him a second\nglance of greater intensity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what in the world has come over'\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d It was the dress which Mr. Libby wore. He was a young fellow\nfar too well made, and carried himself too alertly, to look as if any\nclothes misfitted him; his person gave their good cut elegance, but he\nhad the effect of having fallen away in them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you look as if you\nhad been sick a month!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard interpreted.\n\nThe young man surveyed himself with a downward glance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey're\nJohnson's,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe had them down for a hop at the Long Beach\nHouse, and sent over for them. I had nothing but my camping flannels,\nand they have n't been got into shape yet, since yesterday. I wanted to\ncome over and see how you were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPoor fellow!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mrs. Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never thought of you! How in\nthe world did you get to your camp?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI walked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn all that rain?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I had been pretty well sprinkled, already. It was n't a question\nof wet and dry; it was a question of wet and wet. I was going off\nbareheaded, I lost my hat in the water, you know,--but your man, here,\nhailed me round the corner of the kitchen, and lent me one. I've been\ntaking up collections of clothes ever since.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Libby spoke lightly, and with a cry of \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarlow's hat!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard\nwent off in a shriek of laughter; but a deep distress kept Grace silent.\nIt seemed to her that she had been lacking not only in thoughtfulness,\nbut in common humanity, in suffering him to walk away several miles in\nthe rain, without making an offer to keep him and have him provided for\nin the house. She remembered now her bewildered impression that he was\nwithout a hat when he climbed the stairs and helped her to the house;\nshe recalled the fact that she had thrust him on to the danger he had\nescaped, and her heart was melted with grief and shame. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she\nbegan, going up to him, and drooping before him in an attitude which\nsimply and frankly expressed the contrition she felt; but she could not\ncontinue. Mrs. Maynard's laugh broke into the usual cough, and as soon\nas she could speak she seized the word.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there, now; we can leave it to Mr. Libby. It's the principle of\nthe thing that I look at. And I want to see how it strikes him. I want\nto know, Mr. Libby, if you were a doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he looked at Grace, and\nflushed,--\u00e2\u0080\u009cand a person was very sick, and wanted you to consult with\nanother doctor, whether you would let the mere fact that you had n't\nbeen introduced have any weight with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d The young man silently\nappealed to Grace, who darkened angrily, and before he could speak Mrs.\nMaynard interposed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, you sha'n't ask her. I want your opinion.\nIt's just an abstract question.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She accounted for this fib with a wink\nat Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReally,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's rather formidable. I've never been a doctor of\nany kind.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, we know that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you are now, and now\nwould you do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf the other fellow knew more, I would.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you thought he did n't?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I wouldn't. What are you trying to get at, Mrs. Maynard? I'm not\ngoing to answer any more of your questions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,--one more. Don't you think it's a doctor's place to get his\npatient well any way he can?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere, Grace! It's just exactly the same case. And ninety-nine out of a\nhundred would decide against you every time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLibby turned towards Grace in confusion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Breen--I did n't\nunderstand--I don't presume to meddle in anything--You're not fair, Mrs.\nMaynard! I have n't any opinion on the subject, Miss Breen; I haven't,\nindeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you can't back out, now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mrs. Maynard joyously. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou've\nsaid it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you're quite right, Mr. Libby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace haughtily. She bade him\ngood-morning; but he followed her from the room, and left Mrs. Maynard\nto her triumph.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Breen--Do let me speak to you, please! Upon my word and honor,\nI didn't know what she was driving at; I did n't, indeed! It's pretty\nrough on me, for I never dreamt of setting myself up as a judge of your\naffairs. I know you're right, whatever you think; and I take it all\nback; it was got out of me by fraud, any way. And I beg your pardon for\nnot calling you Doctor--if you want me to do it. The other comes more\nnatural; but I wish to recognize you in the way you prefer, for I do\nfeel most respectul--reverent--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe was so very earnest and so really troubled, and he stumbled about\nso for the right word, and hit upon the wrong one with such unfailing\ndisaster, that she must have been superhuman not to laugh. Her laughing\nseemed to relieve him even more than her hearty speech. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me how you\nlike, Mr. Libby. I don't insist upon anything with you; but I believe I\nprefer Miss Breen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're very kind! Miss Breen it is, then. And you'll, forgive my siding\nagainst you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded radiantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't speak of that again, please. I've nothing to forgive you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey walked down-stairs and out on the piazza. Barlow stood before the\nsteps, holding by the bit a fine bay mare, who twitched her head round\na little at the sound of Libby's voice, and gave him a look. He passed\nwithout noticing the horse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm glad to find Mrs. Maynard so well. With\nthat cold of hers, hanging on so long, I didn't know but she'd be in an\nawful state this morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's a miraculous escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fact is I sent over to New Leyden for my team yesterday. I did n't\nknow how things might turn out, and you're so far from a lemon here,\nthat I thought I might be useful in going errands.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace turned her head and glanced at the equipage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that your team?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young fellow, with a smile of suppressed pride.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat an exquisite creature!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cISN'T she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d They both faced about, and stood looking at the mare,\nand the light, shining, open buggy behind her. The sunshine had the\nafter-storm glister; the air was brisk, and the breeze blew balm from\nthe heart of the pine forest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he broke out, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you'd\ntake a little dash through the woods with me. I've got a broad-track\nbuggy, that's just right for these roads. I don't suppose it's the thing\nat all to ask you, on such short acquaintance, but I wish you would. I\nknow you'd enjoy it: Come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis joyous urgence gave her a strange thrill. She had long ceased\nto imagine herself the possible subject of what young ladies call\nattentions, and she did not think of herself in that way now. There\nwas something in the frank, eager boyishness of the invitation that\nfascinated her, and the sunny face turned so hopefully upon her had its\namusing eloquence. She looked about the place with an anxiety of which\nshe was immediately ashamed: all the ladies were out of sight, and\nprobably at the foot of the cliff.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't say no, Miss Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d pleaded the gay voice.\n\nThe answer seemed to come of itself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, thank you, yes, I should like\nto go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, and the word which riveted her consent made her\nrecoil.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut not this morning. Some other day. I--I--I want to think about Mrs.\nMaynard. I--ought n't to leave her. Excuse me this morning, Mr. Libby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he tried to say with unaltered gayety, but a note of\ndisappointment made itself felt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think she's going to be worse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don't think she is. But--\u00e2\u0080\u009d She paused, and waited a space before\nshe continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm afraid I can't be of use to her any longer. She has\nlost confidence in me--It's important she should trust her physician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Libby blushed, as he always did when required to recognize Grace in her\nprofessional quality. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's more a matter of nerves than anything else,\nand if she does n't believe in me I can't do her any good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I can understand that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man, with gentle sympathy;\nand she felt, somehow, that he delicately refrained from any leading or\nprompting comment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has been urging me to have a consultation with some doctor about\nher case, and I--it would be ridiculous!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I would n't do it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mr. Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know a great deal better\nwhat she wants than she does. You had better make her, do what you say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't mean to burden you with my affairs,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I wished\nto explain her motive in speaking to you as she did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After she had said\nthis, it seemed to her rather weak, and she could not think of anything\nelse that would strengthen it. The young man might think that she had\nasked advice of him. She began to resent his telling her to make Mrs.\nMaynard do what she said. She was about to add something to snub\nhim, when she recollected that it was her own wilfulness which had\nprecipitated the present situation, and she humbled herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe will probably change her mind,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe would if you could\nlet her carry her point,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with a light esteem for Mrs. Maynard\nwhich set him wrong again in Grace's eyes: he had no business to speak\nso to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery likely,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in stiff withdrawal from all terms of\nconfidence concerning Mrs. Maynard. She did not add anything more, and\nshe meant that the young fellow should perceive that his, audience was\nat an end. He did not apparently resent it, but she fancied him hurt in\nhis acquiescence.\n\nShe went back to her patient, whom she found languid and disposed to\nsleep after the recent excitement, and she left her again, taking little\nBella with her. Mrs. Maynard slept long, but woke none the better for\nher nap. Towards evening she grew feverish, and her fever mounted as the\nnight fell. She was restless and wakeful, and between her dreamy dozes\nshe was incessant in her hints for a consultation to Grace, who passed\nthe night in her room, and watched every change for the worse with a\nself-accusing heart. The impending trouble was in that indeterminate\nphase which must give the physician his most anxious moments; and this\ninexperienced girl; whose knowledge was all to be applied, and who had\nhardly arrived yet at that dismaying stage when a young physician finds\nall the results at war with all the precepts, began to realize the\nawfulness of her responsibility. She had always thought of saving life,\nand not of losing it.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nBy morning Grace was as nervous and anxious as her patient, who had\nmomentarily the advantage of her in having fallen asleep. She went\nstealthily out, and walked the length of the piazza, bathing her eyes\nwith the sight of the sea, cool and dim under a clouded sky. At the\ncorner next the kitchen she encountered Barlow, who, having kindled\nthe fire for the cook, had spent s moment of leisure in killing some\nchickens at the barn; he appeared with a cluster of his victims in his\nhand, but at sight of Grace he considerately put them behind him.\n\nShe had not noticed them. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Barlow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow far is it to\nCorbitant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBarlow slouched into a conversational posture, easily resting on his\nraised hip the back of the hand in which he held the chickens. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it\n's accordin' to who you ask. Some says six mile, and real clever folks\nmakes it about four and a quarter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI ask you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d persisted Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the last time I was there, I thought it was about sixty. 'Most\nfroze my fingers goin' round the point. 'N' all I was afraid of was\ngettin' there too soon. Tell you, a lee shore ain't a pleasant neighbor\nin a regular old northeaster. 'F you go by land, I guess it's about ten\nmile round through the woods. Want to send for Dr. Mulbridge? I thought\nmebbe\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. She turned back into the house, and then she came\nrunning out again; but by this time Barlow had gone into the kitchen,\nwhere she heard him telling the cook that these were the last of the\ndommyneckers. At breakfast several of the ladies came and asked after\nMrs. Maynard, whose restless night they had somehow heard of. When she\ncame out of the dining-room' Miss Gleason waylaid her in the hall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, in a repressed tumult, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you won't give\nway. For woman's sake, I hope you won't! You owe it to yourself not to\ngive way! I'm sure Mrs. Maynard is as well off in your hands as she can\nbe. If I did n't think so, I should be the last to advise your being\nfirm; but, feeling as I do, I do advise it most strongly. Everything\ndepends on it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know what you mean, Miss Gleason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm glad it hasn't come to you yet. If it was a question of mere\nprofessional pride, I should say, By all means call him at once. But\nI feel that a great deal more is involved. If you yield, you make it\nharder for other women to help themselves hereafter, and you confirm\nsuch people as these in their distrust of female physicians. Looking at\nit in a large way, I almost feel that it would be better for her to die\nthan for you to give up; and feeling as I do\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you talking of Mrs. Maynard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are all saying that you ought to give up the case to Dr.\nMulbridge. But I hope you won't. I should n't blame you for calling in\nanother female physician\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no danger of her dying. But it\nseems to me that she has too many female physicians already. In this\nhouse I should think it better to call a man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She left the barb to\nrankle in Miss Gleason's breast, and followed her mother to her room,\nwho avenged Miss Gleason by a series of inquisitional tortures, ending\nwith the hope that, whatever she did, Grace would not have that silly\ncreature's blood on her hands. The girl opened her lips to attempt\nsome answer to this unanswerable aspiration, when the unwonted sound of\nwheels on the road without caught her ear.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is that, Grace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded her mother, as if Grace were guilty of\nthe noise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace, rising.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas he come for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know. But I am going down to see him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt sight of the young man's face, Grace felt her heart lighten. He\nhad jumped from his buggy, and was standing at his smiling ease on\nthe piazza steps, looking about as if for some one, and he brightened\njoyfully at her coming. He took her hand with eager friendliness, and\nat her impulse began to move away to the end of the piazza with her. The\nladies had not yet descended to the beach; apparently their interest in\nDr. Breen's patient kept them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow is Mrs. Maynard this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked; and she answered, as they\ngot beyond earshot,--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot better, I'm afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I'm sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you won't be able to drive\nwith me this morning? I hope she is n't seriously worse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added,\nrecurring to Mrs. Maynard at the sight of the trouble in Grace's face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall ask to drive with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she returned. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby, do you know\nwhere Corbitant is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd will you drive me there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, certainly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried, in polite wonder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She turned half round, and cast a woman's look at the other\nwomen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall be ready in half an hour. Will you go away, and comeback\nthen? Not sooner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnything you please, Miss Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, laughing in his\nmystification. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn thirty minutes, or thirty days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey went back to the steps, and he mounted his buggy. She sat down, and\ntaking some work from her pocket, bent her head over it. At first she\nwas pale, and then she grew red. But these fluctuations of color could\nnot keep her spectators long; one by one they dispersed and descended\nthe cliff; and when she rose to go for her hat the last had vanished,\nwith a longing look at her. It was Miss Gleason.\n\nGrace briefly announced her purpose to her mother, who said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you\nare not doing anything impulsive\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and she answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I had quite\nmade up my mind to it last night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMr. Libby had not yet returned when she went back to the piazza, and she\nwalked out on the road by which he must arrive. She had not to walk\nfar. He drew in sight before she had gone a quarter of a mile, driving\nrapidly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I late?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, turning, and pulling up at the roadside,\nwith well-subdued astonishment at encountering her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no; not that I know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She mounted to the seat, and they drove off\nin a silence which endured for a long time. If Libby had been as vain\nas he seemed light, he must have found it cruelly unflattering, for it\nignored his presence and even his existence. She broke the silence at\nlast with a deep-drawn sigh, as frankly sad as if she had been quite\nalone, but she returned to consciousness of him in it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby, you\nmust think it is very strange for me to ask you to drive me to Corbitant\nwithout troubling myself to tell you my errand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm glad to be of use on any\nterms. It is n't often that one gets the chance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am going to see Dr. Mulbridge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, and then stopped so long\nthat he perceived she wished him to say something.\n\nHe said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I thought this morning that I should give Mrs. Maynard's case up\nto him. I shouldn't be at all troubled at seeming to give it up under\na pressure of opinion, though I should not give it up for that. Of\ncourse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou don't know that all those women have been\nsaying that I ought to call in Dr. Mulbridge. It's one of those things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she added bitterly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat make it so pleasant for a woman to try to help\nwomen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He made a little murmur of condolence, and she realized that she\nhad thrown herself on his sympathy, when she thought she had been merely\nthinking aloud. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I mean is that he is a man of experience and\nreputation, and could probably be of more use to her than I, for she\nwould trust him more. But I have known her a long time, and I understand\nher temperament and her character,--which goes for a good deal in such\nmatters,--and I have concluded not to give up the case. I wish to meet\nDr. Mulbridge, however, and ask him to see her in consultation with me.\nThat is all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she ended rather haughtily, as if she had been dramatizing\nthe fact to Dr. Mulbridge in her own mind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think that would be the right thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby limply, with\nuncalled-for approval; but he left this dangerous ground abruptly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs\nyou say, character goes for a great deal in these things. I've seen Mrs.\nMaynard at the point of death before. As a general rule, she does n't\ndie. If you have known her a long time, you know what I mean. She likes\nto share her sufferings with her friends. I've seen poor old Maynard\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace broke in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may speak of Mr. Maynard as you\nlike, but I cannot allow your disrespectfulness to Mrs. Maynard. It's\nshocking! You had no right to be their friend if you felt toward them as\nyou seem to have done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, there was no harm in them. I liked them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained the young man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPeople have no right to like those they don't respect!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLibby looked as if this were rather a new and droll idea. But he seemed\nnot to object to her tutoring him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas far as Mrs.\nMaynard was concerned, I don't know that I liked her any more than I\nrespected her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace ought to have frowned at this, but she had to check a smile in.\norder to say gravely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know she is disagreeable at times. And she\nlikes to share her sufferings with others, as you say. But her husband\nwas fully entitled to any share of them that he may have borne. If he\nhad been kinder to her, she wouldn't be what and where she is now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cKinder to her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Libby exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's the kindest fellow in the world!\nNow, Miss Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said earnestly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope Mrs. Maynard hasn't been\ntalking against her husband to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you don't know they're\nseparated, and that she's going to take steps for a divorce?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA divorce? No! What in the world for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never talk gossip. I thought of course she had told you\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe never told me a word! She was ashamed to do it! She knows that I\nknow Maynard was the best husband in the world to her. All she told\nme was that he was out on his ranch, and she had come on here for her\nhealth. It's some ridiculous little thing that no reasonable woman\nwould have dreamt of caring for. It's one of her caprices. It's her own\nfickleness. She's tired of him,--or thinks she is, and that's all about\nit. Miss Breen, I beg you won't believe anything against Maynard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d faltered Grace, astonished at his fervor; and the\nlight it cast upon her first doubts of him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, I only know the\naffair from her report, and I haven't concerned myself in it, except\nas it affected her health. And I don't wish to misjudge him. And I like\nyour--defending him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, though it instantly seemed a patronizing\nthing to have said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I couldn't withhold my sympathy where I\nbelieved there had been neglect and systematic unkindness, and finally\ndesertion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I know Mrs. Maynard; I know her kind of talk. I've seen Maynard's\nneglect and unkindness, and I know just what his desertion would be. If\nhe's left her, it's because she wanted him to leave her; he did it to\nhumor her, to please her. I shall have a talk with Mrs. Maynard when we\nget back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm afraid I can't allow it at present,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, very seriously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is worse to-day. Otherwise I should n't be giving you this\ntrouble.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it's no trouble\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I'm glad--I'm glad we've had this\nunderstanding. I'm very glad. It makes me think worse of myself and\nbetter of--others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLibby gave a laugh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you like that? You're easily pleased.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe remained grave. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI ought to be able to tell you what I mean. But it\nis n't possible--now. Will you let me beg your pardon?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she urged, with\nimpulsive earnestness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, smiling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd not ask me why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCertainly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you. Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe is so much worse that some one\nof greater experience than I must see her, and I have made up my mind.\nDr. Mulbridge may refuse to consult with me. I know very well that there\nis a prejudice against women physicians, and I couldn't especially blame\nhim for sharing it. I have thought it all over. If he refuses, I shall\nknow what to do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She had ceased to address Libby, who respected her\nsoliloquy. He drove on rapidly over the soft road, where the wheels made\nno sound, and the track wandered with apparent aimlessness through the\ninterminable woods of young oak and pine. The low trees were full of the\nsunshine, and dappled them with shadow as they dashed along; the fresh,\ngreen ferns springing from the brown carpet of the pine-needles were\nas if painted against it. The breath of the pines was heavier for the\nrecent rain; and the woody smell of the oaks was pungent where the\nbalsam failed. They met no one, but the solitude did not make itself\nfelt through her preoccupation. From time to time she dropped a word or\ntwo; but for the most she was silent, and he did not attempt to lead.\nBy and by they came to an opener place, where there were many red\nfield-lilies tilting in the wind.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWould you like some of those?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, pulling up.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should, very much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, glad of the sight of the gay\nthings. But when he had gathered her a bunch of the flowers she looked\ndown at them in her lap, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's silly in me to be caring for\nlilies at such a time, and I should make an unfavorable impression on\nDr. Mulbridge if he saw me with them. But I shall risk their effect on\nhim. He may think I have been botanizing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cUnless you tell him you have n't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the young man suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI need n't do that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think any one else would do it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe colored a little at the tribute to her candor, and it pleased her,\nthough it had just pleased her as much to forget that she was not like\nany other young girl who might be simply and irresponsibly happy in\nflowers gathered for her by a young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't tell him, either!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried, willing to grasp the fleeting emotion again; but it was gone, and\nonly a little residue of sad consciousness remained.\n\nThe woods gave way on either side of the road, which began to be a\nvillage street, sloping and shelving down toward the curve of a quiet\nbay. The neat weather-gray dwellings, shingled to the ground and\nbrightened with door-yard flowers and creepers, straggled off into the\nboat-houses and fishing-huts on the shore, and the village seemed to get\nafloat at last in the sloops and schooners riding in the harbor, whose\nsmooth plane rose higher to the eye than the town itself. The salt\nand the sand were everywhere, but though there had been no positive\nprosperity in Corbitant for a generation, the place had an impregnable\nneatness, which defied decay; if there had been a dog in the street,\nthere would not have been a stick to throw at him.\n\nOne of the better, but not the best, of the village houses, which did\nnot differ from the others in any essential particular, and which\nstood flush upon the street, bore a door-plate with the name Dr. Rufus\nMulbridge, and Libby drew up in front of it without having had to alarm\nthe village with inquiries. Grace forbade his help in dismounting, and\nran to the door, where she rang one of those bells which sharply respond\nat the back of the panel to the turn of a crank in front; she observed,\nin a difference of paint, that this modern improvement had displaced\nan old-fashioned knocker. The door was opened by a tall and strikingly\nhandsome old woman, whose black eyes still kept their keen light under\nher white hair, and whose dress showed none of the incongruity which was\noffensive in the door-bell: it was in the perfection of an antiquated\ntaste, which, however, came just short of characterizing it with gentle\nwomanliness.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Dr. Mulbridge at home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other, with a certain hesitation, and holding the door\najar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to see him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, mounting to the threshold.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it important?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked the elder woman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cQuite,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Grace, with an accent at once of surprise and decision.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may come in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other reluctantly, and she opened a door\ninto a room at the side of the hall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may give Dr. Mulbridge my card, if you please,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, before\nshe turned to go into this room; and the other took it, and left her\nto find a chair for herself. It was a country doctor's office, with the\nusual country doctor's supply of drugs on a shelf, but very much more\nthan the country doctor's usual library: the standard works were there,\nand there were also the principal periodicals and the latest treatises\nof note in the medical world. In a long, upright case, like that of an\nold hall-clock, was the anatomy of one who had long done with time; a\nlaryngoscope and some other professional apparatus of constant utility\nlay upon the leaf of the doctor's desk. There was nothing in the room\nwhich did not suggest his profession, except the sword and the spurs\nwhich hung upon the wall opposite where Grace sat beside one of\nthe front windows. She spent her time in study of the room and its\nappointments, and in now and then glancing out at Mr. Libby, who sat\nstatuesquely patient in the buggy. His profile cut against the sky was\nblameless; and a humorous shrewdness which showed in the wrinkle at his\neye and in the droop of his yellow mustache gave its regularity life\nand charm. It occurred to her that if Dr. Mulbridge caught sight of Mr.\nLibby before he saw her, or before she could explain that she had\ngot one of the gentlemen at the hotel--she resolved upon this\nprevarication--to drive her to Corbitant in default of another\nconveyance, he would have his impressions and conjectures, which\ndoubtless the bunch of lilies in her hand would do their part to\nstimulate. She submitted to this possibility, and waited for his coming,\nwhich began to seem unreasonably delayed. The door opened at last, and\na tall, powerfully framed man of thirty-five or forty, dressed in an\nill-fitting suit of gray Canada homespun appeared. He moved with a\nslow, pondering step, and carried his shaggy head bent downwards from\nshoulders slightly rounded. His dark beard was already grizzled, and she\nsaw that his mustache was burnt and turned tawny at points by smoking,\nof which habit his presence gave stale evidence to another sense. He\nheld Grace's card in his hand, and he looked at her, as he advanced, out\nof gray eyes that, if not sympathetic, were perfectly intelligent, and\nthat at once sought to divine and class her. She perceived that he took\nin the lilies and her coming color; she felt that he noted her figure\nand her dress.\n\nShe half rose in response to his questioning bow, and he motioned her\nto her seat again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had to keep you waiting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was up all\nnight with a patient, and I was asleep when my mother called me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\nstopped here, and definitively waited for her to begin.\n\nShe did not find this easy, as he took a chair in front of her, and sat\nlooking steadily in her face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm sorry to have disturbed you\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not\nat all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe rule is to disturb a doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began again, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I am not sure that I am justified in\ndisturbing you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe waited a little while for her to go on, and then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, let\nus hear.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to consult with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she broke out, and again she came to a\nsudden pause; and as she looked into his vigilant face, in which she was\nnot sure there was not a hovering derision, she could not continue.\nShe felt that she ought to gather courage from the fact that he had not\nstarted, or done anything positively disagreeable when she had asked for\na consultation; but she could not, and it did not avail her to\nreflect that she was rendering herself liable to all conceivable\nmisconstruction,--that she was behaving childishly, with every\nappearance of behaving guiltily.\n\nHe came to her aid again, in a blunt fashion, neither kind nor unkind,\nbut simply common sense. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. What are the symptoms? Where and how are, you sick?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not sick,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. They stared at each other in reciprocal\namazement and mystification.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen excuse me if I ask you what you wish me to do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, realizing his natural error, with a flush. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is\nn't in regard to myself that I wish to consult with you. It's another\nperson--a friend\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge, laughing, with the impatience of a physician\nused to making short cuts through the elaborate and reluctant statements\nof ladies seeking advice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat is the matter with your friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has been an invalid for some time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Grace. The laugh, which\nhad its edge of patronage and conceit, stung her into self-possession\nagain, and she briefly gave the points of Mrs. Maynard's case, with the\nrecent accident and the symptoms developed during the night. He listened\nattentively, nodding his head at times, and now and then glancing\nsharply at her, as one might at a surprisingly intelligent child.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI must see her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said decidedly, when she came to an end. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwill see her as soon as possible. I will come over to Jocelyn's this\nafternoon,--as soon as I can get my dinner, in fact.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThere was such a tone of dismissal in his words that she rose, and he\npromptly followed her example. She stood hesitating a moment. Then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\ndon't know whether you understood that I wish merely to consult with\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I don't wish to relinquish the case to you\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRelinquish the case--consult\u00e2\u0080\u009d--Dr. Mulbridge stared at her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I\ndon't understand. What do you mean by not relinquishing the case? If\nthere is some one else in attendance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am in attendance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl firmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am Mrs. Maynard's\nphysician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou? Physician\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you have looked at my card\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she began with indignant severity.\n\nHe gave a sort of roar of amusement and apology, and then he stared at\nher again with much of the interest of a naturalist in an extraordinary\nspecimen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't look at it\u00e2\u0080\u009d; but he now\ndid so, where he held it crumpled in the palm of his left hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy\nmother said it was a young lady, and I did n't look. Will you will you\nsit down, Dr. Breen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He bustled in getting her several chairs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI live\noff here in a corner, and I have never happened to meet any ladies\nof our profession before. Excuse me, if I spoke under a--mistaken\nimpression. I--I--I should not have--ah--taken you for a physician.\nYou\u00e2\u0080\u009d--He checked himself, as if he might have been going to say that\nshe was too young and too pretty. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course, I shall have pleasure\nin consulting with you in regard to your friend's case, though I've\nno doubt you are doing all that can be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d With a great show of\ndeference, he still betrayed something of the air of one who humors a\njoke; and she felt this, but felt that she could not openly resent it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she returned with dignity, indicating with a gesture of her\nhand that she would not sit down again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am sorry to ask you to come\nso far.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not at all. I shall be driving over in that direction at any rate.\nI've a patient near there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiled upon her with frank curiosity, and\nseemed willing to detain her, but at a loss how to do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I had n't\nbeen stupid from my nap I should have inferred a scientific training\nfrom your statement of your friend's case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She still believed that he\nwas laughing at her, and that this was a mock but she was still helpless\nto resent it, except by an assumption of yet colder state. This had\napparently no effect upon Dr. Mulbridge. He continued to look at her\nwith hardly concealed amusement, and visibly to grow more and more\nconscious of her elegance and style, now that she stood before him.\nThere had been a time when, in planning her career, she had imagined\nherself studying a masculine simplicity and directness of address; but\nthe over-success of some young women, her fellows at the school, in this\ndirection had disgusted her with it, and she had perceived that after\nall there is nothing better for a girl, even a girl who is a doctor\nof medicine, than a ladylike manner. Now, however, she wished that she\ncould do or say something aggressively mannish, for she felt herself\ndwindling away to the merest femininity, under a scrutiny which had its\nfascination, whether agreeable or disagreeable. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nwith really unwarrantable patronage, \u00e2\u0080\u009chave found that the study of\nmedicine has its difficulties,--you must have been very strongly drawn\nto it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, not at all; I had rather an aversion at first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she replied,\nwith the instant superiority of a woman where the man suffers any topic\nto become personal. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you think I was drawn to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know--I don't know that I thought so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he stammered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe\nI intended to ask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added bluntly; but she had the satisfaction of\nseeing him redden, and she did not volunteer anything in his relief. She\ndivined that it would leave him with an awkward sense of defeat if he\nquitted the subject there; and in fact he had determined that he would\nnot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of our ladies take up the study abroad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and he went\non to speak, with a real deference, of the eminent woman who did the\nAmerican name honor by the distinction she achieved in the schools of\nParis.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never been abroad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought all American ladies had been abroad\u00e2\u0080\u009d;\nand now he said, with easy recognition of her resolution not to help him\nout, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose you have your diploma from the Philadelphia school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she returned, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfrom the New York school,--the homoeopathic school\nof New York.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Mulbridge instantly sobered, and even turned a little pale, but he\ndid not say anything. He remained looking at her as if she had suddenly\nchanged from a piquant mystery to a terrible dilemma.\n\nShe moved toward the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I may expect you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout the\nmiddle of the afternoon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not reply; he stumbled upon the chairs in following her a pace\nor two, with a face of acute distress. Then he broke out with \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't\ncome! I can't consult with you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned and looked at him with astonishment, which he did his best to\nmeet. Her astonishment congealed into hauteur, and then dissolved into\nthe helplessness of a lady who has been offered a rudeness; but still\nshe did not speak. She merely looked at him, while he halted and\nstammered on.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPersonally, I--I--should be--obliged--I should feel honored--I--I--It\nhas nothing to do with your--your--being a--a--a--woman lady. I should\nnot care for that. No. But surely you must know the reasons--the\nobstacles--which deter me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, calm with the advantage of his perturbation.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you refuse, that is sufficient. I will not inquire your reasons.\nI will simply withdraw my request.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you. But I beg you to understand that they have no reference\nwhatever to you in--your own--capacity--character--individual quality.\nThey are purely professional--that is, technical--I should say\ndisciplinary,--entirely disciplinary. Yes, disciplinary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The word\nseemed to afford Dr. Mulbridge the degree of relief which can come only\nfrom an exactly significant and luminously exegetic word.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't at all know what you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it is not\nnecessary that I should know. Will you allow me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, for Dr.\nMulbridge had got between her and the door, and stood with his hand on\nthe latch.\n\nHis face flushed, and drops stood on his forehead. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSurely, Miss--I mean\nDoctor--Breen, you must know why I can't consult with you! We belong to\ntwo diametrically opposite schools--theories--of medicine. It would be\nimpracticable--impossible for us to consult. We could find no common\nground. Have you never heard that the--ah regular practice cannot meet\nhomoeopathists in this way? If you had told me--if I had known--you were\na homoeopathist, I could n't have considered the matter at all. I can't\nnow express any opinion as to your management of the case, but I have no\ndoubt that you will know what to do--from your point of view--and that\nyou will prefer to call in some one of your own--persuasion. I hope that\nyou don't hold me personally responsible for this result!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied the girl, with a certain dreamy abstraction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI had\nheard that you made some such distinction--I remember, now. But I could\nn't realize anything so ridiculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Mulbridge colored. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif, even under the\ncircumstances, I can't agree with you that the position taken by the\nregular practice is ridiculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not make any direct reply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I supposed that you only made\nthis distinction, as you call it, in cases where there is no immediate\ndanger; that in a matter of life and death you would waive it. Mrs.\nMaynard is really--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are no conditions under which I could not conscientiously refuse\nto waive it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI withdraw the word! It is not ridiculous. It is\nmonstrous, atrocious, inhuman!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA light of humorous irony glimmered in Dr. Mulbridge's eye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must\nsubmit to your condemnation.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it isn't a personal condemnation!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no\ndoubt that personally you are not responsible. We can lay aside our\ndistinctions as allopathist and homoeopathist, and you can advise with\nme\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's quite impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I advised with you,\nI might be--A little while ago one of our school in Connecticut was\nexpelled from the State Medical Association for consulting with\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he\nbegan to hesitate, as if he had not hit upon a fortunate or appropriate\nillustration, but he pushed on--\u00e2\u0080\u009cwith his own wife, who was a physician\nof your school.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe haughtily ignored his embarrassment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can appreciate your\ndifficulty, and pity any liberal-minded person who is placed as you are,\nand disapproves of such wretched bigotry.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am obliged to tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I don't disapprove\nof it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am detaining you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI beg your pardon. I was curious to\nknow how far superstition and persecution can go in our day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If\nthe epithets were not very accurate, she used them with a woman's\neffectiveness, and her intention made them descriptive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-day,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nadded, and she made a movement toward the door, from which Dr. Mulbridge\nretired. But she did not open the door. Instead, she sank into the chair\nwhich stood in the corner, and passed her hand over her forehead, as if\nshe were giddy.\n\nDr. Mulbridge's finger was instantly on her wrist. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you faint?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she gasped, pulling her hand away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am perfectly well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Then\nshe was silent for a time before she added by a supreme effort, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have\nno right to endanger another's life, through any miserable pride, and\nI never will. Mrs. Maynard needs greater experience than mine, and she\nmust have it. I can't justify myself in the delay and uncertainty of\nsending to Boston. I relinquish the case. I give it to you. And I will\nnurse her under your direction, obediently, conscientiously. Oh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ncried, at his failure to make any immediate response, \u00e2\u0080\u009csurely you won't\nrefuse to take the case!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't refuse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with an effect of difficult concession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwill come. I will drive over at once, after dinner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe rose now, and put her hand on the door-latch. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you object to my\nnursing your patient? She is an old school friend. But I could yield\nthat point too, if\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no, no! I shall be only too glad of your help, and your\u00e2\u0080\u009d--he was\ngoing to say advice, but he stopped himself, and repeated--\u00e2\u0080\u009chelp.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey stood inconclusively a moment, as if they would both be glad of\nsomething more to say. Then she said tentatively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nhe responded experimentally, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-morning\u00e2\u0080\u009d; and with that they\ninvoluntarily parted, and she went out of the door, which he stood\nholding open even after she had got out of the gate.\n\nHis mother came down the stairs. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat in the world were you quarrelling\nwith that girl about, Rufus?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were not quarrelling, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, it sounded like it. Who was she?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated her son absently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Breen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctor Breen? That girl a doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought she was some saucy thing. Well, upon my word!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed Mrs.\nMulbridge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo that is a female doctor, is it? Was she sick?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her son, with what she knew to be professional finality.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, if you can hurry dinner a little, I shall be glad. I have\nto drive over to Jocelyn's, and I should like to start as soon as\npossible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho was the young man with her? Her beau, I guess.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas there a young man with her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Dr. Mulbridge.\n\nHis mother went out without speaking. She could be unsatisfactory, too.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nNo one but Mrs. Breen knew of her daughter's errand, and when Grace came\nback she alighted from Mr. Libby's buggy with an expression of thanks\nthat gave no clew as to the direction or purpose of it. He touched his\nhat to her with equal succinctness, and drove away, including all the\nladies on the piazza in a cursory obeisance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe must ask you, Miss Gleason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour admiration of\nDr. Breen clothes you with authority and responsibility.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't understand it at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gleason confessed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I'm sure\nthere's nothing in it. He isn't her equal. She would feel that it wasn't\nright--under the circumstances.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if Mrs. Maynard was well it would be a fair game, you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nMrs. Alger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Miss Gleason, with the greatest air of candor, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't\nadmit that I meant that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the elder lady, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe presumption is against them. Every\nyoung couple seen together must be considered in love till they prove\nthe contrary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like it in her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Frost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt shows that she is human, after\nall. It shows that she is like other girls. It's a relief.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is n't like other girls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d contended Miss Gleason darkly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would rather have Mr. Libby's opinion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Merritt.\n\nGrace went to Mrs. Maynard's room, and told her that Dr. Mulbridge was\ncoming directly after dinner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew you would do it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, throwing her right arm\nround Grace's neck, while the latter bent over to feel the pulse in her\nleft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew where you had gone as soon as your mother told me you had\ndriven off with Walter Libby. I'm so glad that you've got somebody\nto consult! Your theories are perfectly right and I'm sure that Dr.\nMulbridge will just tell you to keep on as you've been doing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace withdrew from her caress. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Mulbridge is not coming for a\nconsultation. He refused to consult with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRefused to consult? Why, how perfectly ungentlemanly! Why did he\nrefuse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause he is an allopathist and I am a homoeopathist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen, what is he coming for, I should like to know!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have given up the case to him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace wearily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Mrs. Maynard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't be given up. I will\nsimply die! Not a pill, not a powder, of his will I touch! If he thinks\nhimself too good to consult with another doctor, and a lady at that,\nmerely because she doesn't happen to be allopathist, he can go along! I\nnever heard of anything so conceited, so disgustingly mean, in my\nlife. No, Grace! Why, it's horrid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was silent, and then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of\ncourse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he comes, I shall have to see him. I look like a\nfright, I suppose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will do your hair,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, with indifference to these vows and\nprotests; and without deigning further explanation or argument she made\nthe invalid's toilet for her. If given time, Mrs. Maynard would talk\nherself into any necessary frame of mind, and Grace merely supplied the\nmonosyllabic promptings requisite for her transition from mood to mood.\nIt was her final resolution that when Dr. Mulbridge did come she\nshould give him a piece of her mind; and she received him with anxious\nsubmissiveness, and hung upon all his looks and words with quaking\nand with an inclination to attribute her unfavorable symptoms to\nthe treatment of her former physician. She did not spare him certain\napologies for the disorderly appearance of her person and her room.\n\nGrace sat by and watched him with perfectly quiescent observance. The\nlarge, somewhat uncouth man gave evidence to her intelligence that he\nwas all physician--that he had not chosen his profession from any theory\nor motive, however good, but had been as much chosen by it as if he\nhad been born a Physician. He was incredibly gentle and soft in all his\nmovements, and perfectly kind, without being at any moment unprofitably\nsympathetic. He knew when to listen and when not to listen,--to learn\neverything from the quivering bundle of nerves before him without\nseeming to have learnt anything alarming; he smiled when it would do her\ngood to be laughed at, and treated her with such grave respect that she\ncould not feel herself trifled with, nor remember afterwards any point\nof neglect. When he rose and left some medicines, with directions to\nGrace for giving them and instructions for contingencies, she followed\nhim from the room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said anxiously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs. Maynard is threatened with pneumonia. Or, I don't know why I\nshould say threatened,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added; \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe has pneumonia.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI supposed--I was afraid so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d faltered the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked into her eyes with even more seriousness than he spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas she friends here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; her husband is in Cheyenne, out on the plains.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe ought to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cA great deal will depend upon\nher nursing--Miss--ah--Dr. Breen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou need n't call me Dr. Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt present, I am Mrs.\nMaynard's nurse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe ignored this as he had ignored every point connected with the\ninterview of the morning. He repeated the directions he had already\ngiven with still greater distinctness, and, saying that he should come\nin the morning, drove away. She went back to Louise: inquisition for\ninquisition, it was easier to meet that of her late patient than that of\nher mother, and for once the girl spared herself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know he thought I was very bad,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whimpered Mrs. Maynard, for a\nbeginning. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter with me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour cold has taken an acute form; you will have to go to bed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I 'm going to be down sick! I knew I was! I knew it! And what am\nI going to do, off in such a place as this? No one to nurse me, or look\nafter Bella! I should think you would be satisfied now, Grace, with the\nresult of your conscientiousness: you were so very sure that Mr. Libby\nwas wanting to flirt with me that you drove us to our death, because you\nthought he felt guilty and was trying to fib out of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you let me help to undress you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Grace gently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBella shall\nbe well taken care of, and I am going to nurse you myself, under Dr.\nMulbridge's direction. And once for all, Louise, I wish to say that I\nhold myself to blame for all\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes! Much good that does now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Being got into bed, with the sheet\nsmoothed under her chin, she said, with the effect of drawing a strictly\nlogical conclusion from the premises, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I should think George\nMaynard would want to be with his family!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSpent with this ordeal, Grace left her at last, and went out on the\npiazza, where she found Libby returned. In fact, he had, upon second\nthoughts, driven back, and put up his horse at Jocelyn's, that he might\nbe of service there in case he were needed. The ladies, with whom he had\nbeen making friends, discreetly left him to Grace, when she appeared,\nand she frankly walked apart with him, and asked him if he could go over\nto New Leyden, and telegraph to Mr. Maynard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas she asked for him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired, laughing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew it would come to\nthat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has not asked; she has said that she thought he ought to be with\nhis family,\u00e2\u0080\u009d repeated Grace faithfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I know how she said it: as if he had gone away wilfully, and\nkept away against her wishes and all the claims of honor and duty. It\nwouldn't take her long to get round to that if she thought she was very\nsick. Is she so bad?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired, with light scepticism.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's threatened with pneumonia. We can't tell how bad she may be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course I'll telegraph. But I don't think anything serious can\nbe the matter with Mrs. Maynard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Mulbridge said that Mr. Maynard ought to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Libby, in quite a different tone. If she recognized\nthe difference, she was meekly far from resenting it; he, however, must\nhave wished to repair his blunder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you need n't have given up\nthe case to him. I think you're too conscientious about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPlease don't speak of that now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she interposed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I won't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he consented. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan I be of any use here to-night?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, we shall need nothing more. The doctor will be here again in the\nmorning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLibby did not come in the morning till after the doctor had gone, and\nthen he explained that he had waited to hear in reply to his telegram,\nso that they might tell Mrs. Maynard her husband had started; and he had\nonly just now heard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd has he started?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI heard from his partner. Maynard was at the ranch. His partner had\ngone for him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen he will soon be here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe will, if telegraphing can bring him. I sat up half the night with\nthe operator. She was very obliging when she understood the case.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe?\u00e2\u0080\u009d reputed Grace, with a slight frown.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe operators are nearly all women in the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She looked grave. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCan they trust young girls with such important\nduties?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey did n't in this instance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d relied Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was a pretty old\ngirl. What made you think she was young?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know. I thought you said she was young.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She blushed, and\nseemed about to say more, but she did not.\n\nHe waited, and then he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can tell Mrs. Maynard that I\ntelegraphed on my own responsibility, if you think it's going to alarm\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, with a helpless sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't like to tell her that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he suggested, after a moment, in\nwhich he had watched her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I know. And some day I will tell you how--if you will let me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt seemed a question; and she did not know what it was that kept\nher--silent and breathless and hot in the throat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't like to do\nit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said at last. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hate myself whenever I have to feign anything.\nI knew perfectly well that you did n't say she was young,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she broke out\ndesperately.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSay Mrs. Maynard was young?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked stupidly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. She rose hastily from the bench where she had been\nsitting with him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must go back to her now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe mounted to his buggy, and drove thoughtfully away at a walk.\n\nThe ladies, whose excited sympathies for Mrs. Maynard had kept them from\nthe beach till now, watched him quite out of sight before they began to\ntalk of Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope Dr. Breen's new patient will be more tractable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs.\nMerritt. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be a pity if she had to give him up, too, to Dr.\nMulbridge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Scott failed of the point. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, is Mr. Libby sick?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot very,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Mrs. Merritt, with a titter of self-applause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should be sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interposed Mrs. Alger authoritatively, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif we had\nsaid anything to influence the poor thing in what she has done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I don't think we need distress ourselves about undue influence!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Mrs. Merritt exclaimed.\n\nMrs. Alger chose to ignore the suggestion. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe had a very difficult\npart; and I think she has acted courageously. I always feel sorry for\ngirls who attempt anything of that kind. It's a fearful ordeal.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they say Miss Breen was n't obliged to do it for a living,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs.\nScott suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo much the worse,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Merritt.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, so much the better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Mrs. Alger.\n\nMrs. Merritt, sitting on the edge of the piazza, stooped over with\ndifficulty and plucked a glass-straw, which she bit as she looked\nrebelliously away.\n\nMrs. Frost had installed herself as favorite since Mrs. Alger had\npraised her hair. She now came forward, and, dropping fondly at her\nknee, looked up to her for instruction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you think that she showed\nher sense in giving up at the very beginning, if she found she was n't\nequal to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She gave her head a little movement from side to side, and\nput the mass of her back hair more on show.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger, looking at the favorite not very favorably.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I don't think she's given up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gleason interposed, in her\nbreathless manner. She waited to be asked why, and then she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nthink she's acting in consultation with Dr. Mulbridge. He may have a\ncertain influence over her,--I think he has; but I know they are acting\nin unison.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Merritt flung her grass-straw away. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps it is to be Dr.\nMulbridge, after all, and not Mr. Libby.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have thought of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gleason assented candidly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I\nhave thought of that. I have thought of their being constantly thrown\ntogether, in this way. It would not discourage me. She could be quite as\ntrue to her vocation as if she remained single. Truer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTalking of true,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Scott, \u00e2\u0080\u009calways does make me think of blue.\nThey say that yellow will be worn on everything this winter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOld gold?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Frost. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, more than ever.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDear!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the other lady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know what I shall do. It\nperfectly kills my hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Miss Gleason!\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the young girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you believe in character coming out in color?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, certainly. I have always believed that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I've got a friend, and she wouldn't have anything to do with a\ngirl that wore magenta more than she would fly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Miss Gleason, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat all those aniline dyes\nimplied something coarse in people.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs n't it curious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Frost, \u00e2\u0080\u009chow red-haired people have come\nin fashion? I can recollect, when I was a little girl, that everybody\nlaughed at red hair. There was one girl at the first school I ever went\nto,--the boys used to pretend to burn their fingers at her hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think Dr. Breen's hair is a very pretty shade of brown,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the\nyoung girl.\n\nMrs. Merritt rose from the edge of the piazza. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think that if she\nhasn't given up to him entirely she's the most submissive consulting\nphysician I ever saw,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and walked out over the grass towards\nthe cliff.\n\nThe ladies looked after her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Mrs. Merritt more pudgy when she's\nsitting down or when she's standing up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Scott.\n\nMiss Gleason seized her first chance of speaking with Grace alone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh,\ndo you know how much you are doing for us all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDoing for you, all? How doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d faltered Grace, whom she had\nwhisperingly halted in a corner of the hall leading from the\ndining-room.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBy acting in unison,--by solving the most perplexing problem in women's\npractising your profession. She passed the edge of her fan over her lips\nbefore letting it fall furled upon her left hand, and looked luminously\ninto Grace's eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't at all know what you mean, Miss Gleason,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the other.\n\nMiss Gleason kicked out the skirt of her dress, so as to leave herself\nperfectly free for the explanation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPractising in harmony with a\nphysician of the other sex. I have always felt that there was the great\ndifficulty,--how to bring that about. I have always felt that the TRUE\nphysician must be DUAL,--have both the woman's nature and the man's;\nthe woman's tender touch, the man's firm grasp. You have shown how\nthe medical education of women can meet this want. The physician can\nactually be dual,--be two, in fact. Hereafter, I have no doubt we shall\nalways call a physician of each sex. But it's wonderful how you could\never bring it about, though you can do anything! Has n't it worn upon\nyou?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gleason darted out her sentences in quick, short breaths,\nfixing Grace with her eyes, and at each clause nervously tapping her\nchest with her reopened fan.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Dr. Mulbridge and I are acting\nprofessionally in unison, as you call it, you are mistaken. He has\nentire charge of the case; I gave it up to him, and I am merely nursing\nMrs. Maynard under his direction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow splendid!\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gleason exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know that I admire you\nfor giving up,--for knowing when to give up? So few women do that! Is\nn't he magnificent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMagnificent?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean psychically. He is what I should call a strong soul You must\nhave felt his masterfulness; you must have enjoyed it! Don't you like to\nbe dominated?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should n't at all like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I do! I like to meet one of those forceful masculine natures that\nsimply bid you obey. It's delicious. Such a sense of self-surrender,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n Miss Gleason explained. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is n't because they are men,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nhave felt the same influence from some women. I felt it, in a certain\ndegree, on first meeting you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very sorry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace coldly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should dislike being controlled\nmyself, and I should dislike still more to control others.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're doing it now!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Miss Gleason, with delight. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could not\ndo a thing to resist your putting me down! Of course you don't know that\nyou're doing it; it's purely involuntary. And you wouldn't know that he\nwas dominating you. And he would n't.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVery probably Dr. Mulbridge would not have recognized himself in the\ncharacter of all-compelling lady's-novel hero, which Miss Gleason\nimagined for him. Life presented itself rather simply to him, as it does\nto most men, and he easily dismissed its subtler problems from a mind\npreoccupied with active cares. As far as Grace was concerned, she had\ncertainly roused in him an unusual curiosity; nothing less than her\nhomoeopathy would have made him withdraw his consent to a consultation\nwith her, and his fear had been that in his refusal she should escape\nfrom his desire to know more about her, her motives, her purposes. He\nhad accepted without scruple the sacrifice of pride she had made to him;\nbut he had known how to appreciate her scientific training, which\nhe found as respectable as that of any clever, young man of their\nprofession. He praised, in his way, the perfection with which she\ninterpreted his actions and intentions in regard to the patient. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nthere were such nurses as you, Miss Breen, there would be very little\nneed of doctors,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a sort of interogative fashion of\nlaughing peculiar to him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought of being a nurse once;\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps I may still be\none. The scientific training won't be lost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no? It's a pity that more of them have n't it. But I suppose they\nthink nursing is rather too humble an ambition.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think it so,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace briefly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you did n't care for medical distinction.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her quizzically, as if this were much droller than if she\nhad cared. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't understand why you should have gone into it. You\ntold me, I think, that it was repugnant to you; and it's hard work for\na woman, and very uncertain work for anyone. You must have had a\ntremendous desire to benefit your race.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis characterization of her motive was so distasteful that she made\nno reply, and left him to his conjectures, in which he did not appear\nunhappy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you find Mrs. Maynard to-day?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\nHe looked at her with an instant coldness, as if he did not like her\nasking, and were hesitating whether to answer. But he said at last,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe is no better. She will be worse before she is better. You see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I haven't been able to arrest the disorder in its first\nstage. We must hope for what can be done now, in the second.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had gathered from the half jocose ease with which he had listened\nto Mrs. Maynard's account of herself, and to her own report, an\nencouragement which now fell to the ground \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she assented, in her\ndespair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat is the only hope.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe sat beside the table in the hotel parlor, where they found themselves\nalone for the moment, and drubbed upon it with an absent look. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you\nsent for her husband?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he inquired, returning to himself.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; Mr. Libby telegraphed the evening we saw you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge, with comfortable approval; and he\nrose to go away.\n\nGrace impulsively detained him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI--won't--ask you whether you consider\nMrs. Maynard's case a serious one, if you object to my doing so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know that I object,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said slowly, with a teasing smile, such\nas one might use with a persistent child whom one chose to baffle in\nthat way.\n\nShe disdained to avail herself of the implied permission. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat I\nmean--what I wish to tell you is--that I feel myself responsible for her\nsickness, and that if she dies, I shall be guilty of her death.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge, with more interest, but the same smile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat\ndo you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe didn't wish to go that day when she was caught in the storm. But I\ninsisted; I forced her to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She stood panting with the intensity of\nthe feeling which had impelled her utterance.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean by forcing her to go?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know. I--I--persuaded her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Mulbridge smiled, as if he perceived her intention not to tell him\nsomething she wished to tell him. He looked down into his hat, which he\ncarried in his hand.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you believe the storm was coming?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you did n't make it come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her and laughed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you don't at all understand!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm not a doctor of divinity,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood morning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWait, wait!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she implored, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm afraid--I don't know--Perhaps my being\nnear her is injurious to her; perhaps I ought to let some one else nurse\nher. I wished to ask you this\u00e2\u0080\u009d--She stopped breathlessly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think you have done her any harm as yet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered lightly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHowever,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, after a moment's consideration, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhy don't you take\na holiday? Some of the other ladies might look after her a while.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you really think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she palpitated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I might? Do you think I\nought? I'm afraid I ought n't\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot if your devotion is hurtful to her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSend some one else\nto her for a while. Any one can take care of her for a few hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn't leave her--feeling as I do about her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know how you feel about her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you\ncan't go on at this rate. I shall want your help by and by, and Mrs.\nMaynard doesn't need you now. Don't go back to her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if she should get worse while I am away\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou think your staying and feeling bad would make her better? Don't\ngo back,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated; and he went out to his ugly rawboned horse, and,\nmounting his shabby wagon, rattled away. She lingered, indescribably\nput to shame by the brutal common sense which she could not impeach, but\nwhich she still felt was no measure of the case. It was true that she\nhad not told him everything, and she could not complain that he had\nmocked her appeal for sympathy if she had trifled with him by a partial\nconfession. But she indignantly denied to herself that she had wished to\nappeal to him for sympathy.\n\nShe wandered out on the piazza, which she found empty, and stood gazing\nat the sea in a revery of passionate humiliation. She was in that mood,\nfamiliar to us all, when we long to be consoled and even flattered for\nhaving been silly. In a woman this mood is near to tears; at a touch of\nkindness the tears come, and momentous questions are decided. What was\nperhaps uppermost in the girl's heart was a detestation of the man to\nwhom she had seemed a simpleton; her thoughts pursued him, and divined\nthe contempt with which he must be thinking of her and her pretensions.\nShe heard steps on the sand, and Libby came round the corner of the\nhouse from the stable.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nLibby's friends had broken up their camp on the beach, and had gone to\na lake in the heart of the woods for the fishing. He had taken a room at\nthe Long Beach House, but he spent most of his time at Jocelyn's, where\nhe kept his mare for use in going upon errands for Mrs. Maynard. Grace\nsaw him constantly, and he was always doing little things for her with\na divination of her unexpressed desires which women find too rarely in\nmen. He brought her flowers, which, after refusing them for Mrs. Maynard\nthe first time, she accepted for herself. He sometimes brought her\nbooks, the light sort which form the sentimental currency of young\npeople, and she lent them round among the other ladies, who were\ninsatiable of them. She took a pleasure in these attentions, as if they\nhad been for some one else. In this alien sense she liked to be followed\nup with a chair to the point where she wished to sit; to have her hat\nfetched, or her shawl; to drop her work or her handkerchief, secure that\nit would be picked up for her.\n\nIt all interested her, and it was a relief from the circumstances that\nwould have forbidden her to recognize it as gallantry, even if her own\nmind had not been so far from all thought of that. His kindness followed\noften upon some application of hers for his advice or help, for she had\nfallen into the habit of going to him with difficulties. He had a prompt\ncommon sense that made him very useful in emergencies, and a sympathy\nor an insight that was quick in suggestions and expedients. Perhaps\nshe overrated other qualities of his in her admiration of the practical\nreadiness which kept his amiability from seeming weak. But the practical\nhad so often been the unattainable with her that it was not strange she\nshould overrate it, and that she should rest upon it in him with a trust\nthat included all he chose to do in her behalf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is the matter, Mr. Libby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, as he came toward her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs anything the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded in turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; you are looking downcast,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried reproachfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't know that I mustn't look downcast. I did n't suppose it would\nbe very polite, under the circumstances, to go round looking as bobbish\nas I feel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's the best thing you could possibly do. But you're not feeling very\nbobbish now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d A woman respects the word a man uses, not because she\nwould have chosen it, but because she thinks that he has an exact\nintention in it, which could not be reconveyed in a more feminine\nphrase. In this way slang arises. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs n't it time for Mr. Maynard to be\nhere?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. Then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow did you know I was thinking of that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't. I only happened to think it was time. What are you keeping\nback, Mr. Libby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pursued tremulously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing, upon my honor. I almost wish there were something to keep\nback. But there is n't anything. There have n't been any accidents\nreported. And I should n't keep anything back from you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause you would be equal to it, whatever it was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see why you say that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She weakly found comfort in the praise\nwhich she might once have resented as patronage.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see why I should n't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he retorted:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I am not fit to be trusted at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I haven't the strength, to mean anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I thank\nyou, thank you very much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added. She turned her head away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cConfound Maynard!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see why he does n't\ncome. He must have started four days ago. He ought to have' had sense\nenough to telegraph when he did start. I did n't tell his partner to\nask him. You can't think of everything. I've been trying to find out\nsomething. I'm going over to Leyden, now, to try to wake up somebody in\nCheyenne who knows Maynard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked ruefully at Grace, who listened\nwith anxious unintelligence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're getting worn out, Miss Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish I could ask you to go with me to Leyden. It would do you\ngood. But my mare's fallen lame; I've just been to see her. Is there\nanything I can do for you over there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, how are you going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my boat,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered consciously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe same boat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I've had her put to rights. She was n't much damaged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was silent a moment, while he stood looking down at her in the chair\ninto which she had sunk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoes it take you long?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no. It's shorter than it is by land. I shall have the tide with me\nboth ways. I can make the run there and back in a couple of hours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTwo hours?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA sudden impulse, unreasoned and unreasonable, in which there seemed\nhope of some such atonement, or expiation, as the same ascetic nature\nwould once have found in fasting or the scourge, prevailed with her. She\nrose. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she panted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you will let me, I should like to go\nwith you in your boat. Do you think it will be rough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it's a light breeze; just right. You need n't be afraid.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm not afraid. I should not care if it were rough! I should not care\nif it stormed! I hope it--I will ask mother to stay with Mrs. Maynard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Breen had not been pleased to have her daughter in charge of Mrs.\nMaynard's case, but she had not liked her giving it up. She had said\nmore than once that she had no faith in Dr. Mulbridge. She willingly\nconsented to Grace's prayer, and went down into Mrs. Maynard's room, and\ninsinuated misgivings in which the sick woman found so much reason that\nthey began for the first time to recognize each other's good qualities.\nThey decided that the treatment was not sufficiently active, and that\nshe should either have something that would be more loosening to the\ncough, or some application--like mustard plasters--to her feet, so as to\ntake away that stuffed feeling about the head.\n\nAt that hour of the afternoon, when most of the ladies were lying down\nin their rooms, Grace met no one on the beach but Miss Gleason and Mrs.\nAlger, who rose from their beds of sand under the cliff at her passage\nwith Mr. Libby to his dory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you want to go to Leyden?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked jocosely over his shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't mean to say you're going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Miss Gleason demanded of Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, certainly. Why not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you are brave!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe shut her novel upon her thumb, that she might have nothing to do but\nadmire Grace's courage, as the girl walked away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will do her good, poor thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the elder woman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe looks\nwretchedly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI can understand just why she does it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured Miss Gleason in\nadoring rapture.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope she does it for pleasure,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Alger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is n't that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned Miss Gleason mysteriously.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt any rate, Mr. Libby seemed pleased.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, she would never marry HIM!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Gleason.\n\nThe other laughed, and at that moment Grace also laughed. The strong\ncurrent of her purpose, the sense of escape from the bitter servitude of\nthe past week, and the wild hope of final expiation through the chances\nshe was tempting gave her a buoyancy long unfelt. She laughed in gayety\nof heart as she helped the young man draw his dory down the sand, and\nthen took her place at one end while he gave it the last push and then\nleaped in at the other. He pulled out to where the boat lay tilting at\nanchor, and held the dory alongside by the gunwale that she might step\naboard. But after rising she faltered, looking intently at the boat as\nif she missed something there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you had a man to sail your boat\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI had. But I let him go last week. Perhaps I ought to have told\nyou,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking up at her aslant. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you afraid to trust my\nseamanship? Adams was a mere form. He behaved like a fool that day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I'm not afraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. She stepped from the dory into the\nboat, and he flung out the dory's anchor and followed. The sail went up\nwith a pleasant clucking of the tackle, and the light wind filled it.\nLibby made the sheet fast, and, sitting down in the stern on the other\nside, took the tiller and headed the boat toward the town that shimmered\nin the distance. The water hissed at the bow, and seethed and sparkled\nfrom the stern; the land breeze that bent their sail blew cool upon her\ncheek and freshened it with a tinge of color.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will do you good,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, looking into hers with his kind, gay\neyes.\n\nThe color in her cheeks deepened a little. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I am better than I look.\nI did n't come for\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor medicinal purposes. Well, I am glad of it. We've a good hour\nbetween us and news or no news from Maynard, and I should like to think\nwe were out for pleasure. You don't object?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. You can even smoke, if that will heighten the illusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will make it reality. But you don't mean it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; why not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know. But I could n't have dreamt of smoking in your presence.\nAnd we take the liberty to dream very strange things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cit's shocking what things we do dream of people. But\nam I so forbidding?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, a little sadly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby. He got out a pouch of tobacco and some cigarette\npapers, and putting the tiller under his arm, he made himself a\ncigarette.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou seem interested,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, as he lifted his eyes from his work, on\nwhich he found her intent, and struck his fusee.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was admiring your skill,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think it was worth a voyage to South America?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't have thought the voyage was necessary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, perhaps you think you can do it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, handing her the tobacco\nand papers. She took them and made a cigarette. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt took me a whole\nday to learn to make bad ones, and this, is beautiful. But I will never\nsmoke it. I will keep this always.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had better smoke it, if you want more,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you make some more? I can't smoke the first one!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen smoke the last,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, offering him the things back.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, go on. I'll smoke it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe lent herself to the idle humor of the time, and went on making\ncigarettes till there were no more papers. From time to time she looked\nup from this labor, and scanned the beautiful bay, which they had almost\nwholly to themselves. They passed a collier lagging in the deep channel,\nand signalling for a pilot to take her up to the town. A yacht, trim and\nswift, cut across their course; the ladies on board waved a salutation\nwith their handkerchiefs, and Libby responded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut ladies like to take these liberties at a safe\ndistance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that's a specimen of woman's daring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a\nself-scornful curl of the lip, which presently softened into a wistful\nsmile. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow lovely it all is!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sighed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, there's nothing better in all the world than a sail. It is all the\nworld while it lasts. A boat's like your own fireside for snugness.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA dreamier light came into her eye, which wandered, with a turn of the\nhead giving him the tender curve of her cheek, over the levels of the\nbay, roughened everywhere by the breeze, but yellowish green in the\nchannels and dark with the thick growth of eel-grass in the shallows;\nthen she lifted her face to the pale blue heavens in an effort that\nslanted towards him the soft round of her chin, and showed her full\nthroat.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is the kind of afternoon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, still looking at the sky,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you think will never end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish it would n't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.\n\nShe lowered her eyes to his, and asked: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you have times when you are\nsorry that you ever tried to do anything--when it seems foolish to have\ntried?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have the other kind of times,--when I wish that I had tried to do\nsomething.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh yes, I have those, too. It's wholesome to be ashamed of not having\ntried to do anything; but to be ashamed of having tried--it's like\ndeath. There seems no recovery from that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not take advantage of her confession, or try to tempt her to\nfurther confidence; and women like men who have this wisdom, or this\ninstinctive generosity, and trust them further.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the worst of it is that you can't go back and be like those that\nhave never tried at all. If you could, that would be some consolation\nfor having failed. There is nothing left of you but your mistake.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009csome people are not even mistakes. I suppose that\nalmost any sort of success looks a good deal like failure from the\ninside. It must be a poor creature that comes up to his own mark. The\nbest way is not to have any mark, and then you're in no danger of not\ncoming up to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He laughed, but she smiled sadly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't believe in thinking about yourself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I try a little introspection, now and then. But I soon get through:\nthere isn't much of me to think about.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, don't talk in that way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pleaded, and she was very charming\nin her earnestness: it was there that her charm lay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to be\nserious with me, and tell me--tell me how men feel when.\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nA sudden splashing startled her, and looking round she saw a multitude\nof curious, great-eyed, black heads, something like the heads of boys,\nand something like the heads of dogs, thrusting from the water, and\nflashing under it again at sight of them with a swish that sent the\nspray into the air. She sprang to her feet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, look at those things!\nLook at them! Look at them!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She laid vehement hands upon the young man,\nand pushed him in the direction in which she wished him to look, at some\nrisk of pushing him overboard, while he laughed at her ecstasy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey're seals. The bay's full of them. Did you never see them on the\nreef at Jocelyn's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never saw them before!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow wonderful they are! Oh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nshouted; as one of them glanced sadly at her over its shoulder, and then\nvanished with a whirl of the head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Beatrice Cenci attitude!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey 're always trying that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLook yonder.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He pointed to\na bank of mud which the tide had not yet covered, and where a herd of\nseals lay basking in the sun. They started at his voice, and wriggling\nand twisting and bumping themselves over the earth to the water's edge,\nthey plunged in. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTheir walk isn't so graceful as their swim. Would\nyou like one for a pet, Miss Breen? That's all they 're good for since\nkerosene came in. They can't compete with that, and they're not the kind\nthat wear the cloaks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was standing with her hand pressed hard upon his shoulder.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid they ever kill them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey used to take that precaution.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWith those eyes? It was murder!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She withdrew her hand and sat down.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, they only catch them, now. I tried it myself once. I set out at\nlow tide, about ten o'clock, one night, and got between the water\nand the biggest seal on the bank. We fought it out on that line till\ndaylight.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd did you get it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded, absurdly interested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, it got me. The tide came in, and the seal beat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am glad of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did you want with it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think I wanted it at all. At any rate, that's what I always\nsaid. I shall have to ask you to sit on this side,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, loosening\nthe sheet and preparing to shift the sail. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wind has backed round a\nlittle more to the south, and it's getting lighter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it's going down we shall be late,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with an intimation of\napprehension.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe shall be at Leyden on time. If the wind falls then, I can get a\nhorse at the stable and have you driven back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe kept scanning the sky. Then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you ever hear them whistle for a\nwind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. What is it like?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Adams does it, it's like this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He put on a furtive look,\nand glanced once or twice at her askance. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said with the\nreproduction of a strong nasal, \u00e2\u0080\u009cof course I don't believe there's\nanything in it. Of course it's all foolishness. Now you must urge me a\nlittle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, in his own manner.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, by all means go on, Mr. Adams,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, with a laugh.\n\nHe rolled his head again to one side sheepishly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don't presume it DOES have anything to do with the wind--well,\nI don't PRESUME it does.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He was silent long enough to whet an imagined\nexpectation; then he set his face towards the sky, and began a soft,\nlow, coaxing sibilation between his teeth. \u00e2\u0080\u009cS-s-s-s; s-s-s-s-s-s! Well,\nit don't stand to reason it can bring the wind--S-s-s-s-s-s-s; s-s-s-s.\nWhy, of course it 's all foolishness. S-s-s-s.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He continued to emit\nthese sibilants, interspersing them with Adams's protests. Suddenly the\nsail pulled the loose sheet taut and the boat leaped forward over the\nwater.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWonderful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's what I said to Adams, or words to that effect. But I thought we\nshould get it from the look of the sky before I proposed to whistle for\nit. Now, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will be serious, if you like.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSerious?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. Didn't you ask me to be serious just before those seals\ninterrupted you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed, coloring a little. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think we can go back\nto that, now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not insist, and she said presently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought the\nsailors had a superstition about ships that are lucky and unlucky. But\nyou've kept your boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI kept her for luck: the lightning never strikes twice in the same\nplace. And I never saw a boat that behaved so well.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you call it behaving well to tip over?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe behaved well before that. She didn't tip over outside the reef\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt certainly goes very smoothly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl. She had in vain\nrecurred to the tragic motive of her coming; she could not revive it;\nthere had been nothing like expiation in this eventless voyage; it had\nbeen a pleasure and no penance. She abandoned herself with a weak luxury\nto the respite from suffering and anxiety; she made herself the good\ncomrade of the young man whom perhaps she even tempted to flatter her\nfarther and farther out of the dreariness in which she had dwelt; and if\nany woful current of feeling swept beneath, she would not fathom it,\nbut resolutely floated, as one may at such times, on the surface. They\nlaughed together and jested; they talked in the gay idleness of such\nrare moods.\n\nThey passed a yacht at anchor, and a young fellow in a white duck cap,\nleaning over the rail, saluted Libby with the significant gravity which\none young man uses towards another whom he sees in a sail-boat with a\npretty girl.\n\nShe laughed at this. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you know your friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. This time I do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe fancies you are taking some young lady a sail. What would he say if\nyou were to stop and introduce me to him as Dr. Breen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, he knows who you are. It's Johnson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe one whose clothes you came over in, that morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I suppose you laughed at me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI liked your having the courage to do it. But how does he know me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--I described you. He's rather an old friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This also amused her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to hear how you described me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will tell you sometime. It was an elaborate description. I could n't\nget through with it now before we landed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe old town had come out of the haze of the distance,--a straggling\nvillage of weather-beaten wood and weather-beaten white paint,\npicturesque, but no longer a vision of gray stone and pale marble. A\ncoal-yard, and a brick locomotive house, and rambling railroad sheds\nstretched along the water-front. They found their way easily enough\nthrough the sparse shipping to the steps at the end of the wooden pier,\nwhere Libby dropped the sail and made his boat fast.\n\nA little pleasant giddiness, as if the lightness of her heart had\nmounted to her head, made her glad of his arm up these steps and up the\nwharf; and she kept it as they climbed the sloping elm-shaded village\nstreet to the main thoroughfare, with its brick sidewalks, its shops and\nawnings, and its cheerful stir and traffic.\n\nThe telegraph office fronted the head of the street which they had\nascended. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou can sit here in the apothecary's till I come down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nsaid.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think that will be professionally appropriate? I am only a nurse\nnow.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I wasn't thinking of that. But I saw a chair in there. And we can\nmake a pretense of wanting some soda. It is the proper thing to treat\nyoung ladies to soda when one brings them in from the country.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt does have that appearance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she assented, with a smile. She kept\nhim waiting with what would have looked like coquettish hesitation in\nanother, while she glanced at the windows overhead, pierced by a skein\nof converging wires. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuppose I go up with you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like that better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; and she followed him lightly up\nthe stairs that led to the telegraph office. A young man stood at the\nmachine with a cigar in his mouth, and his eyes intent upon the ribbon\nof paper unreeling itself before him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust hold on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to Libby, without turning his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've got\nsomething here for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He read: \u00e2\u0080\u009cDespatch received yesterday. Coming\nright through. George Maynard.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGood!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Libby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDated Council Bluffs. Want it written out?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. What 's to pay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPaid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the operator.\n\nThe laconically transacted business ended with this, the wire began\nto cluck again like the anxious hen whose manner the most awful and\nmysterious of the elements assumes in becoming articulate, and nothing\nremained for them but to come away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat was what I was afraid of,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMaynard was at his ranch,\nand it must have been a good way out. They're fifty or sixty miles out,\nsometimes. That would account for the delay. Well, Mrs. Maynard doesn't\nknow how long it takes to come from Cheyenne, and we can tell her he's\non the way, and has telegraphed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They were walking rapidly down the\nstreet to the wharf where his boat lay. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, halting\nabruptly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI promised to send you back by land, if you preferred.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHas the wind fallen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no. We shall have a good breeze:\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't put you to the trouble of getting a horse. I can go back\nperfectly well in the boat.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that's what I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said cheerily.\n\nShe did not respond, and he could not be aware that any change had come\nover her mood. But when they were once more seated in the boat, and the\nsail was pulling in the fresh breeze, she turned to him with a scarcely\nconcealed indignation. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you a fancy for experimenting upon people,\nMr. Libby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cExperimenting? I? I don't know in the least what you mean!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you tell me that the operator was a woman?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause the other operator is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, and fell blankly silent.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is a good deal of business there. They have to have two\noperators,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he explained, after a pause.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured in deep humiliation. If he had suffered\nher to be silent as long as she would, she might have offered him some\nreparation; but he spoke.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy did you think I had been experimenting on you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated. The sense of having put herself in the wrong\nexasperated her with him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I dare say you were curious. Don't you\nsuppose I have noticed that men are puzzled at me? What did you mean by\nsaying that you thought I would be equal to anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI meant--I thought you would like to be treated frankly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you would n't treat everybody so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn't treat Mrs. Maynard so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou treat me upon a theory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you like that? We treat everybody upon a theory\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I should tell you the worst of anything at once, because I think\nyou are one of the kind that don't like to have their conclusions made\nfor them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you would really let women make their own conclusions,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are very peculiar!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She waited a while, and then she asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd\nwhat is your theory of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat you are very peculiar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are proud.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd is pride so very peculiar?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; in women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed! You set up for a connoisseur of female character. That's very\ncommon, nowadays. Why don't you tell me something more about Yourself?\nWe're always talking about me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe might well have been doubtful of her humor. He seemed to decide that\nshe was jesting, for he answered lightly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, you began it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know I did, this time. But now I wish to stop it, too.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked down at the tiller in his hands. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should\nlike to tell you about myself. I should like to know what you think of\nthe kind of man I am. Will you be honest if I will?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's a very strange condition,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, meeting and then\navoiding the gaze he lifted to her face.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat? Being honest?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, no--Or, yes!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is n't for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you. But I'm not under discussion now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, in the first place,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he began, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was afraid of you when we met.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfraid of me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is n't the word, perhaps. We'll say ashamed of myself. Mrs.\nMaynard told me about you, and I thought you would despise me for not\ndoing or being anything in particular. I thought you must.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hesitated, as if still uncertain of her mood from this intonation,\nand then he went on: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I had some little hope you would tolerate\nme, after all. You looked like a friend I used to have.--Do you mind my\ntelling you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no. Though I can't say that it's ever very comfortable to be told\nthat you look like some one else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't suppose any one else would have been struck by the\nresemblance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby, with a laugh of reminiscence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe was huge.\nBut he had eyes like a girl,--I beg your pardon,--like yours.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou mean that I have eyes like a man.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then turned grave. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs long as he\nlived\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, is he dead?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked more gently than she had yet spoken.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, he died just before I went abroad. I went out on business for my\nfather,--he's an importer and jobber,--and bought goods for him. Do you\ndespise business?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know anything about it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did it to please my father, and he said I was a very good buyer.\nHe thinks there's nothing like buying--except selling. He used to sell\nthings himself, over the counter, and not so long ago, either.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI fancied it made a difference for me when I was in college, and that\nthe yardstick came between me and society. I was an ass for thinking\nanything about it. Though I did n't really care, much. I never liked\nsociety, and I did like boats and horses. I thought of a profession,\nonce. But it would n't work. I've been round the world twice, and I've\ndone nothing but enjoy myself since I left college,--or try to. When I\nfirst saw you I was hesitating about letting my father make me of use.\nHe wants me to become one of the most respectable members of society,\nhe wants me to be a cotton-spinner. You know there 's nothing so\nirreproachable as cotton, for a business?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I don't know about those things.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there is n't. When I was abroad, buying and selling, I made a\nlittle discovery: I found that there were goods we could make and sell\nin the European market cheaper than the English, and that gave my father\nthe notion of buying a mill to make them. I'm boring you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he bought it; and he wants me to take charge of it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd shall you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think I'm fit for it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? How should I know?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't know cotton; but you know me a little. Do I strike you as fit\nfor anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She made no reply to this, and he laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI assure you\nI felt small enough when I heard what you had done, and thought--what\nI had done. It gave me a start; and I wrote my father that night that I\nwould go in for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI once thought of going to a factory town,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, without\nwilful evasion, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto begin my practice there among the operatives'\nchildren. I should have done it if it had not been for coming here with\nMrs. Maynard. It would have been better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCome to my factory town, Miss Breen! There ought to be fevers there\nin the autumn, with all the low lands that I'm allowed to flood Mrs.\nMaynard told me about your plan.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPray, what else did Mrs. Maynard tell you about me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout your taking up a profession, in the way you did, when you\nneedn't, and when you did n't particularly like it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. Then she added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd because I was n't obliged to it,\nand did n't like it, you tolerated me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTolerated?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he echoed.\n\nThis vexed her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, tolerate! Everybody, interested or not, has to\nmake up his mind whether to tolerate me as soon as he hears what I am.\nWhat excuse did you make for me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't make any,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Libby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you had your misgiving, your surprise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought if you could stand it, other people might. I thought it was\nyour affair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJust as if I had been a young man?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! That wasn't possible.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was silent. Then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe conversation has got back into the old\nquarter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are talking about me again. Have you heard from\nyour friends since they went away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat friends?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose you were camping with.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat did they say when they heard that you had found a young doctress\nat Jocelyn's? How did you break the fact to them? What jokes did they\nmake? You need n't be afraid to tell me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGive me Mr.\nJohnson's comments.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her in surprise that incensed her still more, and rendered\nher incapable of regarding the pain with which he answered her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'm\nafraid,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have done something to offend you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no! What could you have done?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you really mean to ask me whether I would let any one make a joke\nof you in my presence?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes; why not?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause it was impossible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy was it impossible?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pursued.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause--I love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had been looking him defiantly in the eyes, and she could not\nwithdraw her gaze. For the endless moment that ensued, her breath was\ntaken away. Then she asked in a low, steady voice, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you mean to say\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe you, and I forgive you. No, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, at a\ndemonstration of protest from him, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon't speak again!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe obeyed, instantly, implicitly. With the tiller in his hand he looked\npast her and guided the boat's course. It became intolerable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave I ever done anything that gave you the right to--to--say that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she asked, without the self-command which she might have wished to show.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou were only the most beautiful\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not beautiful! And if I were\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wasn't to be helped! I saw from the first how good and noble you\nwere, and\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is absurd!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am neither good nor noble; and if I\nwere\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt wouldn't make any difference. Whatever you are, you are the one\nwoman in the world to me; and you always will be.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I must speak now! You were always thinking, because you had studied\na man's profession, that no one would think of you as a woman, as if\nthat could make any difference to a man that had the soul of a man in\nhim!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she protested. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't think that. I always expected to be\nconsidered as a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut not as a woman to fall in love with. I understood. And that somehow\nmade you all the dearer to me. If you had been a girl like other girls,\nI should n't have cared for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't mean to speak to you to-day. But sometime I did mean to\nspeak; because, whatever I was, I loved you; and I thought you did n't\ndislike me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did like you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery much. And I respected you. But you\ncan't say that I ever gave you any hope in this--this--way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She almost\nasked him if she had.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,--not purposely. And if you did, it 's over now. You have rejected\nme. I understand that. There's no reason why you shouldn't. And I can\nhold my tongue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He did not turn, but looked steadily past her at the\nboat's head.\n\nAn emotion stirred in her breast which took the form of a reproach. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWas\nit fair, then, to say this when neither of us could escape afterwards?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't mean to speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, without looking up, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I never\nmeant to place you where you could n't escape.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIt was true that she had proposed to go with him in the boat, and that\nshe had chosen to come back with him, when he had offered to have her\ndriven home from Leyden. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, you are not to blame,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, at last.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI asked to some with you. Shall I tell you why?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Her voice began to\nbreak. In her pity for him and her shame for herself the tears started\nto her eyes. She did not press her question, but, \u00e2\u0080\u009cThank you for\nreminding me that I invited myself to go with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with\nfeeble bitterness.\n\nHe looked up at her in silent wonder, and she broke into a sob. He said\ngently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't suppose you expect me to deny that. You don't think me\nsuch a poor dog as that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with quivering lips, while she\npressed her handkerchief to her eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was only too glad to have you come. I always meant to tell you--what\nI have told; but not when I should seem to trap you into listening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can believe that of you. I do believe it. I take\nback what I said. Don't let us speak of it any more now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued,\nstruggling for her lost composure, with what success appeared in the\nfresh outburst with which she recognized his forbearance to hint at any\npainfulness to himself in the situation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't mind it so much on my account, but oh! how could you for your\nown sake? Do let us get home as fast as we can!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am doing everything I can to release you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you will\nsit here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, indicating the place beside him in the stern, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\nwon't have to change so much when I want to tack.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took the other seat, and for the first time she noticed that the\nwind had grown very light. She watched him with a piteous impatience\nwhile he shifted the sail from side to side, keeping the sheet in his\nhand for convenience in the frequent changes. He scanned the sky, and\nturned every current of the ebbing tide to account. It was useless; the\nboat crept, and presently it scarcely moved.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wind is down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, making the sheet fast, and relaxing his\nhold on the tiller.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd--And the tide is going out!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tide is going out,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he admitted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we should get caught on these flats,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began, with rising\nindignation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe should have to stay till the tide turned.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked wildly about for aid. If there were a row-boat anywhere\nwithin hail, she could be taken to Jocelyn's in that. But they were\nquite alone on those lifeless waters.\n\nLibby got out a pair of heavy oars from the bottom of the boat, and,\nsetting the rowlocks on either side, tugged silently at them.\n\nThe futile effort suggested an idea to her which doubtless she would not\nhave expressed if she had not been lacking, as she once said, in a sense\nof humor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy don't you whistle for a wind?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe stared at her in sad astonishment to make sure that she was in\nearnest, and then, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhistle!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he echoed forlornly, and broke into a\njoyless laugh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou knew the chances of delay that I took in asking to come with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you should have warned me. It was ungenerous--it was\nungentlemanly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was whatever you like. I must be to blame. I suppose I was too glad\nto have you come. If I thought anything, I thought you must have some\nparticular errand at Leyden. You seemed anxious to go, even if it\nstormed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it had stormed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should not have cared! I hoped it\nwould storm. Then at least I should have run the same danger,--I hoped\nit would be dangerous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't understand what you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI forced that wretched creature to go with you that day when you said\nit was going to be rough; and I shall have her blood upon my hands if\nshe dies.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs it possible,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Libby, pulling in his useless oars, and leaning\nforward upon them, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she has gone on letting you think I believed\nthere was going to be a storm? She knew perfectly well that I didn't\nmind what Adams said; he was always croaking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She sat looking at him in\na daze, but she could not speak, and he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see: it happened\nby one chance in a million to turn out as he said; and she has been\nmaking you pay for it. Why, I suppose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with a melancholy\nsmile of intelligence, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe's had so much satisfaction in holding you\nresponsible for what's happened, that she's almost glad of it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has tortured me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the girl. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you--you, when you saw that\nI did n't believe there was going to be any storm, why did you--why\ndidn't--you\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't believe it either! It was Mrs. Maynard that proposed the\nsail, but when I saw that you did n't like it I was glad of any excuse\nfor putting it off. I could n't help wanting to please you, and I\ncouldn't see why you urged us afterwards; but I supposed you had some\nreason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe passed her hand over her forehead, as if to clear away the confusion\nin which all this involved her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why--why did you let me go on\nthinking myself to blame\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow could I know what you were thinking? Heaven knows I didn't dream of\nsuch a thing! Though I remember, now, your saying\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I see!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are a man! But I can't forgive it,--no,\nI can't forgive it! You wished to deceive her if you did n't wish to\ndeceive me. How can you excuse yourself for repeating what you did n't\nbelieve?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was willing she should think Adams was right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd that was deceit. What can you say to it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is only one thing I could say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he murmured, looking hopelessly\ninto her eyes, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand that's of no use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe turned her head away. Her tragedy had fallen to nothing; or rather\nit had never been. All her remorse, all her suffering, was mere farce\nnow; but his guilt in the matter was the greater. A fierce resentment\nburned in her heart; she longed to make him feel something of the\nanguish she had needlessly undergone.\n\nHe sat watching her averted face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said huskily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill\nyou let me speak to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you have me in your power,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered cruelly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSay what you\nlike.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not speak, nor make any motion to do so.\n\nA foolish, idle curiosity to know what, after all that had happened,\nhe could possibly have to say, stirred within her, but she disdainfully\nstifled it. They were both so still that a company of seals found it\nsafe to put their heads above water, and approach near enough to examine\nher with their round soft eyes. She turned from the silly things in\ncontempt that they should even have interested her. She felt that from\ntime to time her companion lifted an anxious glance to the dull heavens.\nAt last the limp sail faintly stirred; it flapped; it filled shallowly;\nthe boat moved. The sail seemed to have had a prescience of the wind\nbefore it passed over the smooth water like a shadow.\n\nWhen a woman says she never will forgive a man, she always has a\ncondition of forgiveness in her heart. Now that the wind had risen\nagain, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have no right to forbid you to speak,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, as if no\nsilence had elapsed, and she turned round and quietly confronted him;\nshe no longer felt so impatient to escape.\n\nHe did not meet her eye at once, and he seemed in no haste to avail\nhimself of the leave granted him. A heavy sadness blotted the gayety of\na face whose sunny sympathy had been her only cheer for many days. She\nfancied a bewilderment in its hopelessness which smote her with still\nsharper pathos. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI appreciate your wish to do\nwhat I wanted, about Mrs. Maynard. I remember my telling you that she\nought n't to go out, that day. But that was not the way to do it\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was no other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she assented, upon reflection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen it ought n't to have been\ndone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe showed no sign of intending to continue, and after a moment of\nrestlessness, she began again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I have been rude or hasty in refusing to hear you, Mr. Libby, I am\nvery wrong. I must hear anything you have to say.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, not unless you wish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish whatever you wish.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm not sure that I wish that now. I have thought it over; I should\nonly distress you for nothing. You are letting me say why sentence\nshouldn't be passed upon me. Sentence is going to be passed any way. I\nshould only repeat what I have said. You would pity me, but you couldn't\nhelp me. And that would give you pain for nothing. No, it would be\nuseless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt would be useless to talk to me about--loving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She took the word on\nher lips with a certain effect of adopting it for convenience' sake in\nher vocabulary. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll that was ended for me long ago,--ten years ago. And\nmy whole life since then has been shaped to do without it. I will tell\nyou my story if you like. Perhaps it's your due. I wish to be just. You\nmay have a right to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I haven't. But--perhaps I ought to say that Mrs. Maynard told me\nsomething.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I am glad of that, though she had no right to do it. Then you can\nunderstand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, I can understand. I don't pretend that I had any reason in\nit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe forbore again to urge any plea for himself, and once more she was\nobliged to interfere in his behalf. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Libby, I have never confessed\nthat I once wronged you in a way that I'm very sorry for.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAbout Mrs. Maynard? Yes, I know. I won't try to whitewash myself; but\nit didn't occur to me how it would look. I wanted to talk with her about\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to have considered her, though,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said gently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe ought to have considered herself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he retorted, with his unfailing\nbitterness for Mrs. Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut it doesn't matter whose fault it was.\nI'm sufficiently punished; for I know that it injured me with you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt did at first. But now I can see that I was wrong. I wished to tell\nyou that. It isn't creditable to me that I thought you intended to flirt\nwith her. If I had been better myself\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He could not say more.\n\nThat utter faith in her was very charming. It softened her more and\nmore; it made her wish to reason with him, and try gently to show him\nhow impossible his hope was. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, recurring to\nsomething that had gone before, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat even if I had cared for you in\nthe way you wish, it could n't be. You would n't want to have people\nlaughing and saying I had been a doctress.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't have minded. I know how much people's talk is worth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI know you would be generous and brave about\nthat--about anything. But what--what if I could n't give up my\ncareer--my hopes of being useful in the way I have planned? You would\nn't have liked me to go on practising medicine?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought of that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered simply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't see how it could\nbe done. But if you saw any way, I was willing--No, that was my great\ntrouble! I knew that it was selfish in me, and very conceited, to\nsuppose you would give up your whole life for me; and whenever I thought\nof that, I determined not to ask you. But I tried not to think of that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, don't you see? But if I could have answered you as you wish, it\nwouldn't have been anything to give up everything for you. A woman\nisn't something else first, and a woman afterwards. I understand how\nunselfishly you meant, and indeed, indeed, I thank you. But don't let's\ntalk of it any more. It couldn't have been, and there is nothing\nbut misery in thinking of it. Come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with a struggle for\ncheerfulness, \u00e2\u0080\u009clet us forget it. Let it be just as if you hadn't spoken\nto me; I know you did n't intend to do it; and let us go on as if\nnothing had happened.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, we can't go on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall get away, as soon as Maynard\ncomes, and rid you of the sight of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you going away?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she softly asked. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy need you? I know that\npeople always seem to think they can't be friends after--such a thing as\nthis. But why shouldn't we? I respect you, and I like you very much. You\nhave shown me more regard and more kindness than any other friend\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I wasn't your friend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI loved you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sighed, in gentle perplexity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthen you can't be my friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever. But I shall always love you. If it would do any good, I would\nstay, as you ask it. I should n't mind myself. But I should be a\nnuisance to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she exclaimed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will take the risk of that. I need your\nadvice, your--sympathy, your--You won't trouble me, indeed you won't.\nPerhaps you have mistaken your--feeling about me. It's such a very\nlittle time since we met,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pleaded.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat makes no difference,--the time. And I'm not mistaken.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, stay at least till Mrs. Maynard is well, and we can all go away\ntogether. Promise me that!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She instinctively put out her hand toward\nhim in entreaty. He took it, and pressing it to his lips covered it with\nkisses.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she grieved in reproachful surprise.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see that I must go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she sighed in assent, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou must go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThey did not look at each other again, but remained in a lamentable\nsilence while the boat pushed swiftly before the freshening breeze; and\nwhen they reached the place where the dory lay, he dropped the sail and\nthrew out the anchor without a word.\n\nHe was haggard to the glance she stole at him, when they had taken their\nplaces in the dory, and he confronted her, pulling hard at the oars. He\ndid not lift his eyes to hers, but from time to time he looked over his\nshoulder at the boat's prow, and he rowed from one point to another for\na good landing. A dreamy pity for him filled her; through the memories\nof her own suffering, she divined the soreness of his heart.\n\nShe started from her reverie as the bottom of the dory struck the sand.\nThe shoal water stretched twenty feet beyond. He pulled in the oars and\nrose desperately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's of no use: I shall have to carry you ashore.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe sat staring up into his face, and longing to ask him something, to\naccuse him of having done this purposely. But she had erred in so many\ndoubts, her suspicions of him had all recoiled so pitilessly upon her,\nthat she had no longer the courage to question or reproach him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no,\nthank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said weakly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI won't trouble you. I--I will wait till\nthe tide is out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe tide's out now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered with coldness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you can't wade.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe rose desperately. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, of course!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried in self-contempt,\nglancing at the water, into which he promptly stepped to his boot-tops.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA woman must n't get her feet wet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nGrace went to her own room to lay aside her shawl and hat, before going\nto Mrs. Maynard, and found her mother sewing there.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, who is with Mrs. Maynard?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Gleason is reading to her,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she had any sort\nof active treatment, she could get well at once. I couldn't take the\nresponsibility of doing anything for her, and it was such a worry to\nstay and see everything going wrong, that when Miss Gleason came in\nI was glad to get away. Miss Gleason seems to believe in your Dr.\nMulbridge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy Dr. Mulbridge!\u00e2\u0080\u009d echoed Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe talked of him as if he were yours. I don't know what you've been\nsaying to her about him; but you had better be careful. The woman is a\nfool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She now looked up at her daughter for the first time. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, what\nis the matter with you what kept you so long? You look perfectly wild.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel wild,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace calmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wind went down.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWas that all? I don't see why that should make you feel wild,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her\nmother, dropping her spectacles to her sewing again.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was n't all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the girl, sinking provisionally upon the side\nof a chair, with her shawl still on her arm, and her hat in her hand.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother, have you noticed anything peculiar about Mr. Libby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's the only person who seems to be of the slightest use about here;\nI've noticed that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's always going and coming for\nyou and Mrs. Maynard. Where is that worthless husband of hers? Has n't\nhe had time to come from Cheyenne yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's on the way. He was out at his ranch when Mr. Libby telegraphed\nfirst, and had to be sent for. We found a despatch from him at Leyden,\nsaying he had started,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace explained.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat business had he to be so far away at all?\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded her mother. It\nwas plain that Mrs. Breen was in her most censorious temper, which had\nprobably acquired a sharper edge towards Maynard from her reconciliation\nwith his wife.\n\nGrace seized her chance to meet the worst. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think that I have\ndone anything to encourage Mr. Libby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, looking bravely at her\nmother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEncourage him to do what?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Mrs. Breen, without lifting her eyes\nfrom her work.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEncouraged him to--think I cared for him; to--to be in love with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Breen lifted her head now, and pushed her spectacles up on her\nforehead, while she regarded her daughter in silence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHas he been\nmaking love to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHer mother pushed her spectacles down again; and, turning the seam which\nshe had been sewing, flattened it with her thumb-nail. She made this\naction expressive of having foreseen such a result, and of having\nstruggled against it, neglected and alone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then. I hope you\naccepted him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked quietly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy not? You must like him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued in the same tone. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have\nbeen with him every moment the last week that you have n't been with\nMrs. Maynard. At least I've seen nothing of you, except when you came\nto tell me you were going to walk or to drive with him. You seem to have\nasked him to take you most of the time.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can you say such a thing, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid n't you ask him to let you go with him this afternoon? You told me\nyou did.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I did. I did it for a purpose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAh! for a purpose,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Breen, taking a survey of the new seam,\nwhich she pulled from her knee, where one end of it was pinned, towards\nher chin. She left the word to her daughter, who was obliged to take it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI asked him to let me go with him because Louise had tortured me about\nmaking her go out in his boat, till I could n't bear it any longer. It\nseemed to me that if I took the same risk myself, it would be something;\nand I hoped there would be a storm.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think you had taken leave of your senses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Breen\nobserved, with her spectacles intent upon her seam. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you think it\nwould be any consolation to him if you were drowned, or to her? And if,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she added, her conscience rising equal to the vicarious demand upon it,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cyou hoped there would be danger, had you any right to expose him to it?\nEven if you chose to risk your own life, you had no right to risk his.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n She lifted her spectacles again, and turned their austere glitter upon\nher daughter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it all seems very silly now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl, with a hopeless sigh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSilly!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried her mother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm glad you can call it silly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd it seemed worse still when he told me that he had never believed\nit was going to storm that day, when he took Louise out. His man said it\nwas, and he repeated it because he saw I did n't want her to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d suggested Mrs. Breen, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif he was willing to deceive her then,\nhe is willing to deceive you now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe didn't deceive her. He said what he had heard. And he said it\nbecause he--I wished it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI call it deceiving. Truth is truth. That is what I was taught; and\nthat's what I supposed I had taught you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI would trust Mr. Libby in anything,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned the daughter. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe is\nperfectly frank about himself. He confessed that he had done it to\nplease me. He said that nothing else could excuse it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, then you have accepted him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, mother, I haven't. I have refused him, and he is going away as\nsoon as Mr. Maynard comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She sat looking at the window, and the tears\nstole into her eyes, and blurred the sea and sky together where she saw\ntheir meeting at the horizon line.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her mother, \u00e2\u0080\u009ctheir that is the end of it, I presume.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that's the end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut--I felt sorry for him, mother.\nOnce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she went on, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought I had everything clear before me; but now\nI seem only to have made confusion of my life. Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added drearily,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cit was foolish and wicked, and it was perfectly useless, too. I can't\nescape from the consequences of what I did. It makes no difference what\nhe believed or any one believed. I drove them on to risk their lives\nbecause I thought myself so much better than they; because I was\nself-righteous and suspicious and stubborn. Well, I must bear the\npenalty: and oh, if I could only bear it alone!\u00e2\u0080\u009d With a long sigh she\ntook back the burden which she had been struggling to cast off, and from\nwhich for a time she had actually seemed to escape. She put away her hat\nand shawl, and stood before the glass, smoothing her hair. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen will\nit ever end?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she moaned to the reflection there, rather than to her\nmother, who did not interrupt this spiritual ordeal. In another age,\nsuch a New England girl would have tortured herself with inquisition\nas to some neglected duty to God;--in ours, when religion is so largely\nhumanified, this Puritan soul could only wreak itself in a sense of\nirreparable wrong to her fellow-creature.\n\nWhen she went out she met Miss Gleason half-way down the corridor to\nMrs. Maynard's door. The latter had a book in her hand, and came forward\nwhispering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's asleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said very sibilantly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have read her\nto sleep, and she's sleeping beautifully. Have you ever read it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nasked, with hoarse breaks from her undertone, as she held up one of\nthose cheap library-editions of a novel toward Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJane Eyre? Why, of course. Long ago.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSo have I,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Gleason. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I sent and got it again, to refresh\nmy impressions of Rochester. We all think Dr. Mulbridge is just like\nhim. Rochester is my ideal character,--a perfect conception of a man:\nso abrupt, so rough, so savage. Oh, I like those men! Don't you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nfluted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs. Maynard sees the resemblance, as well as the rest of us.\nBut I know! You don't approve of them. I suppose they can't be defended\non some grounds; but I can see how, even in such a case as this, the\nperfect mastery of the man-physician constitutes the highest usefulness\nof the woman-physician. The advancement of women must be as women. 'Male\nand female created he them,' and it is only in remembering this that\nwe are helping Gawd, whether as an anthropomorphic conception or a\nuniversally pervading instinct of love, don't you think?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWith her novel clapped against her breast, she leaned winningly over\ntoward Grace, and fixed her with her wide eyes, which had rings of white\nround the pupils.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo tell me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she ran on without waiting an answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDidn't you go with\nMr. Libby because you hoped it might storm, and wished to take the same\nrisk as Mrs. Maynard? I told Mrs. Alger you did!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace flushed guiltily, and Miss Gleason cowered a little, perhaps\ninterpreting the color as resentment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should consider that a very\nsilly motive,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, helplessly ashamed that she was leaving the\nweight of the blow upon Miss Gleason's shoulders instead of her own.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Miss Gleason enthusiastically, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou can't confess\nit. But I know you are capable of such a thing--of anything heroic!\nDo forgive me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, seizing Grace's hand. She held it a moment,\ngazing with a devouring fondness into her face, which she stooped a\nlittle sidewise to peer up into. Then she quickly dropped her hand, and,\nwhirling away, glided slimly out of the corridor.\n\nGrace softly opened Mrs. Maynard's door, and the sick woman opened her\neyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI was n't asleep,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said hoarsely, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I had to pretend to\nbe, or that woman would have killed me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace went to her and felt her hands and her flushed forehead.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am worse this evening,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Maynard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d sighed the girl, dropping into a chair at the bedside, with\nher eyes fixed in a sort of fascination on the lurid face of the sick\nwoman.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter getting me here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d continued Mrs. Maynard, in the same low, hoarse\nmurmur, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou might at least stay with me a little. What kept you so\nlong?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wind fell. We were becalmed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe were not becalmed the day I went out with Mr. Libby. But perhaps\nnobody forced you to go.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHaving launched this dart, she closed her eyes again with something more\nlike content than she had yet shown: it had an aim of which she could\nalways be sure.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe have heard from Mr. Maynard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace humbly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere was a\ndespatch waiting for Mr. Libby at Leyden. He is on his way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Maynard betrayed no immediate effect of this other than to say, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\nhad better hurry,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and did not open her eyes.\n\nGrace went about the room with a leaden weight in every fibre, putting\nthe place in order, and Mrs. Maynard did not speak again till she\nhad finished. Then she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want you to tell me just how bad Dr.\nMulbridge thinks I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe has never expressed any anxiety,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace began, with her inaptness at\nevasion.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course he has n't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d murmured the sick woman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe isn't a fool! What\ndoes he say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis passed the sufferance even of remorse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe says you mustn't talk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n the girl flashed out. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if you insist upon doing so, I will leave\nyou, and send some one else to take care of you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cVery well, then. I know what that means. When a doctor tells you not to\ntalk, it's because he knows he can't do you any good. As soon as George\nMaynard gets here I will have some one that can cure me, or I will know\nthe reason why.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The conception of her husband as a champion seemed to\ncommend him to her in novel degree. She shed some tears, and after a\nlittle reflection she asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow soon will he be here?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe seems to have started yesterday\nmorning.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe can be here by day after to-morrow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Maynard computed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\nwill be some one to look after poor little Bella then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, as\nif, during her sickness, Bella must have been wholly neglected. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't\nlet the child be all dirt when her father comes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMother will look after Bella,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace replied, too meek again to resent\nthe implication. After a pause, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added beseechingly,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've suffered so much from my own wrong-headedness and obstinacy that I\ncouldn't bear to see you taking the same risk, and I'm so glad that you\nare going to meet your husband in the right spirit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat right spirit?\u00e2\u0080\u009d croaked Mrs. Maynard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe wish to please him, to\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't choose to have him say that his child disgraces him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied\nMrs. Maynard, in the low, husky, monotonous murmur in which she was\nobliged to utter everything.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut, dear Louise!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried the other, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou choose something else too,\ndon't you? You wish to meet him as if no unkindness had parted you, and\nas if you were to be always together after this? I hope you do! Then I\nshould feel that all this suffering and, trouble was a mercy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOther people's misery is always a mercy to them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d hoarsely suggested\nMrs. Maynard.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace submitted, with meek conviction. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut,\nLouise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she pleaded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou will make up with your husband, won't you?\nWhatever he has done, that will surely be best. I know that you love\nhim, and that he must love you, yet. It's the only way. If you were\nfinally separated from him, and you and he could be happy apart, what\nwould become of that poor child? Who will take a father's place with\nher? That's the worst about it. Oh, Louise, I feel so badly for you--for\nwhat you have lost, and may lose. Marriage must change people so that\nunless they live to each other, their lives will be maimed and useless.\nIt ought to be so much easier to forgive any wrong your husband does you\nthan to punish it; for that perpetuates the wrong, and forgiveness ends\nit, and it's the only thing that can end a wrong. I am sure that\nyour husband will be ready to do or say anything you wish; but if he\nshouldn't, Louise, you will receive him forgivingly, and make the first\nadvance? It's a woman's right to make the advances in forgiving.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Maynard lay with her hands stretched at her side under the\ncovering, and only her face visible above it. She now turned her head a\nlittle, so as to pierce the earnest speaker with a gleam from her dull\neye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHave you accepted Walter Libby?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLouise!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Grace, with a blush that burned like fire.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's the way I used to talk when I was first engaged. Wait till\nyou're married a while. I want Bella to have on her pique, and her pink\nsash,--not the cherry one. I should think you would have studied to be\na minister instead of a doctor. But you need n't preach to me; I shall\nknow how to behave to George Maynard when he comes,--if he ever does\ncome. And now I should think you had made me talk enough!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, recalled to her more immediate duty in alarm.\n\nAll her helpfulness was soon to be needed. The disease, which had\nlingered more than usual in the early stages, suddenly approached a\ncrisis. That night Mrs. Maynard grew so much worse that Grace sent Libby\nat daybreak for Dr. Mulbridge; and the young man, after leading out his\nown mare to see if her lameness had abated, ruefully put her back in the\nstable, and set off to Corbitant with the splay-foot at a rate of speed\nunparalleled, probably, in the animal's recollection of a long and\nuseful life. In the two anxious days that followed, Libby and Grace were\nassociated in the freedom of a common interest outside of themselves;\nshe went to him for help and suggestion, and he gave them, as if nothing\nhad passed to restrict or embarrass their relations. There was that, in\nfact, in the awe of the time and an involuntary disoccupation of hers\nthat threw them together even more constantly than before. Dr. Mulbridge\nremained with his patient well into the forenoon; in the afternoon he\ncame again, and that night he did not go away. He superseded Grace as\na nurse no less completely than he had displaced her as a physician. He\nlet her relieve him when he flung himself down for a few minutes' sleep,\nor when he went out for the huge meals which he devoured, preferring\nthe unwholesome things with a depravity shocking to the tender physical\nconsciences of the ladies who looked on; but when he returned to his\ncharge, he showed himself jealous of all that Grace had done involving\nthe exercise of more than a servile discretion. When she asked him once\nif there were nothing else that she could do, he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cfires, keep\nthose women and children quiet,\u00e2\u0080\u009d in a tone that classed her with both.\nShe longed to ask him what he thought of Mrs. May nard's condition; but\nshe had not the courage to invoke the intelligence that ignored her\nso completely, and she struggled in silence with such disheartening\nauguries as her theoretical science enabled her to make.\n\nThe next day was a Sunday, and the Sabbath hush which always hung over\nJocelyn's was intensified to the sense of those who ached between hope\nand fear for the life that seemed to waver and flicker in that still\nair. Dr. Mulbridge watched beside his patient, noting every change with\na wary intelligence which no fact escaped and no anxiety clouded; alert,\ngentle, prompt; suffering no question, and absolutely silent as to all\nimpressions. He allowed Grace to remain with him when she liked, and\nlet her do his bidding in minor matters; but when from time to time she\nescaped from the intolerable tension in which his reticence and her own\nfear held her, he did not seem to see whether she went or came. Toward\nnightfall she met him coming out of Mrs. Maynard's room, as she drew\nnear in the narrow corridor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere is your friend--the young man--the one who smokes?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked, as\nif nothing unusual had occupied him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want him to give me a cigar.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Mulbridge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not bear this any longer. I must know\nthe worst--you have no right to treat me in this way. Tell me now--tell\nme instantly: will she live?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked at her with an imaginable apprehension of hysterics, but as\nshe continued firm, and placed herself resolutely in his way, he relaxed\nhis scrutiny, and said, with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I think so. What made you\nthink she would n't?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe drew herself aside, and made way far him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. She would have said more, but her indignation choked\nher.\n\nHe did not pass at once, and he did not seem troubled at her anger.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDr. Breen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw a good deal of pneumonia in the army, and\nI don't remember a single case that was saved by the anxiety of the\nsurgeon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe went now, as people do when they fancy themselves to have made a\ngood point; and she heard him asking Barlow for Libby, outside, and then\nwalking over the gravel toward the stable. At that moment she doubted\nand hated him so much that she world have been glad to keep Libby from\ntalking or even smoking with him. But she relented a little toward him\nafterwards, when he returned and resumed the charge of his patient with\nthe gentle, vigilant cheerfulness which she had admired in him from the\nfirst, omitting no care and betraying none. He appeared to take it for\ngranted that Grace saw an improvement, but he recognized it by nothing\nexplicit till he rose and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I will leave Mrs. Maynard with\nyou to-night, Dr. Breen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe sick woman's eyes turned to him imploringly from her pillow,\nand Grace spoke the terror of both when she faltered in return, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre\nyou--you are not going home?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall sleep in the house.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, thank you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried fervently.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd you can call me if you wish. But there won't be any occasion.\nMrs. Maynard is very much better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He waited to give, in a sort of\nabsent-minded way, certain directions. Then he went out, and Grace sank\nback into the chair from which she had started at his rising, and wept\nlong and silently with a hidden face. When she took away her hands and\ndried her tears, she saw Mrs. Maynard beckoning to her. She went to the\nbedside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat is it, dear?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked tenderly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cStoop down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d whispered the other; and as Grace bowed her ear Mrs.\nMaynard touched her cheek with her dry lips. In this kiss doubtless\nshe forgave the wrong which she had hoarded in her heart, and there\nperverted into a deadly injury. But they both knew upon what terms the\npardon was accorded, and that if Mrs. Maynard had died, she would have\ndied holding Grace answerable for her undoing.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nIn the morning Dr. Mulbridge drove back to Corbitant, and in the evening\nLibby came over from New Leyden with Maynard, in a hired wagon. He was\na day later than his wife had computed, but as she appeared to have\nreflected, she had left the intervening Sunday out of her calculation;\nthis was one of the few things she taxed herself to say. For the rest,\nshe seemed to be hoarding her strength against his coming.\n\nGrace met him at a little distance from the house, whither she had\nwalked with Bella, for a breath of the fresh air after her long day in\nthe sick-room, and did not find him the boisterous and jovial Hoosier\nshe had imagined him. It was, in fact, hardly the moment for the\nexpression of Western humor. He arrived a sleep-broken, travel-creased\nfigure, with more than the Western man's usual indifference to dress;\nwith sad, dull eyes, and an untrimmed beard that hung in points and\ntags, and thinly hid the corners of a large mouth. He took her hand\nlaxly in his, and bowing over her from his lank height listened to her\nreport of his wife's state, while he held his little girl on his left\narm, and the child fondly pressed her cheek against his bearded face,\nto which he had quietly lifted her as soon as he alighted from Libby's\nbuggy.\n\nLibby introduced Grace as Dr. Breen, and drove on, and Maynard gave\nher the title whenever he addressed her, with a perfect effect of\nsingle-mindedness in his gravity, as if it were an every-day thing\nwith him to meet young ladies who were physicians. He had a certain\nneighborly manner of having known her a long time, and of being on good\nterms with her; and somewhere there resided in his loosely knit organism\na powerful energy. She had almost to run in keeping at his side, as\nhe walked on to the house, carrying his little girl on his arm, and\nglancing about him; and she was not sure at last that she had succeeded\nin making him understand how serious the case had been.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know whether I ought to let you go in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithout\npreparing her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's been expecting me, has n't she?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, but\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd she's awake?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen I'll just go in and prepare her myself. I'm a pretty good hand\nat preparing people to meet me. You've a beautiful location here, Dr.\nBreen; and your town has a chance to grow. I like to see a town have\nsome chance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with a sadness past tears in his melancholy\neyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBella can show me the way to the room, I reckon,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\nsetting the little one down on the piazza, and following her indoors;\nand when Grace ventured, later, to knock at the door, Maynard's voice\nbade her come in.\n\nHe sat beside his wife's pillow, with her hand in his left; on his right\narm perched the little girl, and rested her head on his shoulder. They\ndid not seem to have been talking, and they did not move when Grace\nentered the room. But, apparently, Mrs. Maynard had known how to behave\nto George Maynard, and peace was visibly between them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, you tell me about the medicines, Dr. Breen, and then you go and\nget some rest,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maynard in his mild, soothing voice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI used to\nunderstand Mrs. Maynard's ways pretty well, and I can take care of her.\nLibby told me all about you and your doings, and I know you must feel as\npale as you look.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you can't have had any sleep on the way,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Grace began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSleep?\u00e2\u0080\u009d Maynard repeated, looking wanly at her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never sleep. I'd as\nsoon think of digesting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAfter she had given him the needed instructions he rose from the\nrocking-chair in-which he had been softly swinging to and fro, and\nfollowed her out into the corridor, caressing with his large hand the\nchild that lay on his shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMrs. Maynard is\nstill very sick, and needs the greatest care and attention.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I understand that. But I reckon it will come out all right in the\nend,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with the optimistic fatalism which is the real religion\nof our orientalizing West. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGood-night, doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe went away, feeling suddenly alone in this exclusion from the\ncares that had absorbed her. There was no one on the piazza, which the\nmoonlight printed with the shadows of the posts and the fanciful jigsaw\nwork of the arches between them. She heard a step on the sandy walk\nround the corner, and waited wistfully.\n\nIt was Barlow who came in sight, as she knew at once, but she asked,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Barlow?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes'm,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barlow. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat can I do for you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing. I thought it might be Mr. Libby at first. Do you know where he\nis?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I know where he ain't,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Barlow; and having ineffectually\nwaited to be questioned further, he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe ain't here, for one\nplace. He's gone back to Leyden. He had to take that horse back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cN' I guess he's goin' to stay.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo stay? Where?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, there you've got me again. All I know is I've got to drive that\nmare of his'n over to-morrow, if I can git off, and next day if I can't.\nDid n't you know he was goin'?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Barlow, willing to recompense\nhimself for the information he had given.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added sympathetically, at a little hesitation of hers:\n\nThen she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI knew he must go. Good-night, Mr. Barlow,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and went\nindoors. She remembered that he had said he would go as soon as Maynard\ncame, and that she had consented that this would be best. But his going\nnow seemed abrupt, though she approved it. She thought that she had\nsomething more to say to him, which might console him or reconcile him;\nshe could not think what this was, but it left an indefinite longing,\nan unsatisfied purpose in her heart; and there was somewhere a tremulous\nsense of support withdrawn. Perhaps this was a mechanical effect of the\ncessation of her anxiety for Mrs. Maynard, which had been a support as\nwell as a burden. The house was strangely quiet, as if some great noise\nhad just been hushed, and it seemed empty. She felt timid in her room,\nbut she dreaded the next day more than the dark. Her life was changed,\nand the future, which she had once planned so clearly, and had felt\nso strong to encounter, had fallen to a ruin, in which she vainly\nendeavored to find some clew or motive of the past. She felt remanded\nto the conditions of the girlhood that she fancied she had altogether\noutlived; she turned her face upon her pillow in a grief of bewildered\naspiration and broken pride, and shed tears scarcely predicable of a\ndoctor of medicine.\n\nBut there is no lapse or aberration of character which can be half so\nsurprising to others as it is to one's self. She had resented Libby's\ntreating her upon a theory, but she treated herself upon a theory, and\nwe all treat ourselves upon a theory. We proceed each of us upon the\ntheory that he is very brave, or generous, or gentle, or liberal, or\ntruthful, or loyal, or just. We may have the defects of our virtues, but\nnothing is more certain than that we have our virtues, till there comes\na fatal juncture, not at all like the juncture in which we had often\nimagined ourselves triumphing against temptation. It passes, and the\nhero finds, to his dismay and horror, that he has run away; the generous\nman has been niggard; the gentleman has behaved like a ruffian, and the\nliberal like a bigot; the champion of truth has foolishly and vainly\nlied; the steadfast friend has betrayed his neighbor, the just person\nhas oppressed him. This is the fruitful moment, apparently so sterile,\nin which character may spring and flower anew; but the mood of abject\nhumility in which the theorist of his own character is plunged and\nstruggles for his lost self-respect is full of deceit for others. It\ncannot last: it may end in disowning and retrieving the error, or it may\nend in justifying it, and building it into the reconstructed character,\nas something upon the whole unexpectedly fine; but it must end, for\nafter all it is only a mood. In such a mood, in the anguish of her\ndisappointment at herself, a woman clings to whatever support offers,\nand it is at his own risk that the man who chances to be this support\naccepts the weight with which she casts herself upon him as the measure\nof her dependence, though he may make himself necessary to her, if he\nhas the grace or strength to do it.\n\nWithout being able to understand fully the causes of the dejection\nin which this girl seemed to appeal to him, Mulbridge might well\nhave believed himself the man to turn it in his favor. If he did not\nsympathize with her distress, or even clearly divine it, still his bold\ngeneralizations, he found, always had their effect with women, whose\nnatures are often to themselves such unknown territory that a man who\nassumes to know them has gone far to master them. He saw that a rude\nmoral force alone seemed to have a charm with his lady patients,--women\nwho had been bred to ease and wealth, and who had cultivated, if not\nvery disciplined, minds. Their intellectual dissipation had apparently\nmade them a different race from the simpler-hearted womenkind of his\nneighbors, apt to judge men in a sharp ignorance of what is fascinating\nin heroes; and it would not be strange if he included Grace in the sort\nof contemptuous amusement with which he regarded these-flatteringly\ndependent and submissive invalids. He at least did not conceive of her\nas she conceived of herself; but this may be impossible to any man with\nregard to any woman.\n\nWith his experience of other women's explicit and even eager obedience,\nthe resistance which he had at first encountered in Grace gave zest\nto her final submission. Since he had demolished the position she had\nattempted to hold against him, he liked her for having imagined she\ncould hold it; and she had continued to pique and interest him. He\nrelished all her scruples and misgivings, and the remorse she had tried\nto confide to him; and if his enjoyment of these foibles of hers took\ntoo little account of her pain, it was never his characteristic to be\ntender of people in good health. He was, indeed, as alien to her Puritan\nspirit as if he had been born in Naples instead of Corbitant. He came\nof one of those families which one finds in nearly every New England\ncommunity, as thoroughly New England in race as the rest, but\nflourishing in a hardy scepticism and contempt of the general sense.\nWhatever relation such people held to the old Puritan commonwealth when\nPuritanism was absolute, they must later have taken an active part in\nits disintegration, and were probably always a destructive force at its\nheart.\n\nMulbridge's grandfather was one of the last captains who sailed a slaver\nfrom Corbitant. When this commerce became precarious, he retired from\nthe seas, took a young wife in second marriage, and passed his declining\ndays in robust inebriety. He lived to cast a dying vote for General\nJackson, and his son, the first Dr. Mulbridge, survived to illustrate\nthe magnanimity of his fellow-townsmen during the first year of the\ncivil war, as a tolerated Copperhead. Then he died, and his son, who was\nin the West, looking up a location for practice, was known to have gone\nout as surgeon with one of the regiments there. It was not supposed that\nhe went from patriotism; but when he came back, a year before the end of\nthe struggle, and settled in his native place, his service in the army\nwas accepted among his old neighbors as evidence of a better disposition\nof some sort than had hitherto been attributable to any of his name.\n\nIn fact, the lazy, good-natured boy, whom they chiefly remembered before\nhis college days, had always been well enough liked among those who had\nsince grown to be first mates and ship captains in the little port where\nhe was born and grew up. They had now all retired from the sea, and,\nhaving survived its manifold perils, were patiently waiting to be\ndrowned in sail-boats on the bay. They were of the second generation of\nships' captains still living in Corbitant; but they would be the last.\nThe commerce of the little port had changed into the whaling trade in\ntheir time; this had ceased in turn, and the wharves had rotted away.\nDr. Mulbridge found little practice among them; while attending their\nappointed fate, they were so thoroughly salted against decay as to\npreserve even their families. But he gradually gathered into his hands,\nfrom the clairvoyant and the Indian doctor, the business which they had\nshared between them since his father's death. There was here and there a\ntragical case of consumption among the farming families along the coast,\nand now and then a frightful accident among the fishermen; the spring\nand autumn brought their typhoid; the city people who came down to the\nneighboring hotels were mostly sick, or fell sick; and with the small\nproperty his father had left, he and his mother contrived to live.\n\nThey dwelt very harmoniously together; for his mother, who had passed\nmore than a quarter of a century in strong resistance to her husband's\nwill, had succumbed, as not uncommonly happens with such women, to the\nauthority of her son, whom she had no particular pleasure or advantage\nin thwarting. In the phrase and belief of his neighbors, he took after\nher, rather than his father; but there was something ironical and\nbaffling in him, which the local experts could not trace to either the\nMulbridges or the Gardiners. They had a quiet, indifferent faith in his\nability to make himself a position and name anywhere; but they were\nnot surprised that he had come back to live in Corbitant, which was so\nmanifestly the best place in the world, and which, if somewhat lacking\nin opportunity, was ample in the leisure they believed more congenial to\nhim than success. Some of his lady patients at the hotels, who felt at\ntimes that they could not live without him, would have carried him back\nto the city with them by a gentle violence; but there was nothing in\nanything he said or did that betrayed ambition on his part. He liked to\nhear them talk, especially of their ideas of progress, as they called\nthem, at which, with the ready adaptability of their sex, they joined\nhim in laughing when they found that he could not take them seriously.\nThe social, the emotional expression of the new scientific civilization\nstruck him as droll, particularly in respect to the emancipation of\nwomen; and he sometimes gave these ladies the impression that he did\nnot value woman's intellect at its true worth. He was far from light\ntreatment of them, he was considerate of the distances that should be\nguarded; but he conveyed the sense of his scepticism as to their fitness\nfor some things to which the boldest of them aspired.\n\nHis mother would have been willing to have him go to the city if he\nwished, but she was too ignorant of the world outside of Corbitant to\nguess at his possibilities in it, and such people as she had seen from\nit had not pleased her with it. Those summer-boarding lady patients who\ncame to see him were sometimes suffered to wait with her till he came\nin, and they used to tell her how happy she must be to keep such a\nson with her, and twittered their patronage of her and her nice\nold-fashioned parlor, and their praises of his skill in such wise\nagainst her echoless silence that she conceived a strong repugnance\nfor all their tribe, in which she naturally included Grace when she\nappeared. She had decided the girl to be particularly forth-putting,\nfrom something prompt and self-reliant in her manner that day; and she\nviewed with tacit disgust her son's toleration of a handsome young woman\nwho had taken up a man's profession. They were not people who gossiped\ntogether, or confided in each other, and she would have known nothing\nand asked nothing from him about her, further than she had seen for\nherself. But Barlow had folks, as he called them, at Corbitant; and\nwithout her own connivance she had heard from them of all that was\npassing at Jocelyn's.\n\nIt was her fashion to approach any subject upon which she wished her\nson to talk as if they had already talked of it, and he accepted this\nconvention with a perfect understanding that she thus expressed at once\nher deference to him and her resolution to speak whether he liked it or\nnot. She had not asked him about Mrs. Maynard's sickness, or shown any\ninterest in it; but after she learned from the Barlows that she was no\nlonger in danger, she said to her son one morning, before he drove away\nupon his daily visit, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs her husband going to stay with her, or is he\ngoing back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know, really,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, glancing at her where she sat erect\nacross the table from him, with her hand on the lid of the coffee-pot,\nand her eyes downcast; it was the face of silent determination not to\nbe put off, which he knew. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't suppose you care, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added\npleasantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's nothing to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she assented. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's that friend of hers going\nto do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhich friend?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know. The one that came after you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh! Dr. Breen. Yes. What did you think of her?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see why you call her doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I do it out of politeness. Besides, she is one sort of doctor.\nLittle pills,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, with an enjoyment of his mother's grimness on\nthis point.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to see a daughter of mine pretending to be a doctor,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n said Mrs. Mulbridge.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you would n't like Dr. Breen for a daughter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d returned her son, in\nthe same tone as before.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe wouldn't like me for a mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Mulbridge retorted.\n\nHer son laughed, and helped himself to more baked beans and a fresh\nslice of rye-and-Indian. He had the homely tastes and the strong\ndigestion of the people from whom he sprung; and he handed his cup to be\nfilled with his mother's strong coffee in easy defiance of consequences.\nAs he took it back from her he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should like to see you and Mrs.\nBreen together. You would make a strong team.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He buttered his bread,\nwith another laugh in appreciation of his conceit. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you happened to\npull the same way. If you did n't, something would break. Mrs. Breen is\na lady of powerful convictions. She thinks you ought to be good, and you\nought to be very sorry for it, but not so sorry as you ought to be for\nbeing happy. I don't think she has given her daughter any reason to\ncomplain on the last score.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He broke into his laugh again, and watched\nhis mother's frown with interest. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI suspect that she does n't like me\nvery well. You could meet on common ground there: you don't like her\ndaughter.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey must be a pair of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Mulbridge immovably. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid her\nmother like her studying for a doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I understand so. Her mother is progressive she believes in the\nadvancement of women; she thinks the men would oppress them if they got\na chance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf one half the bold things that are running about the country had\nmasters it would be the best thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Mulbridge, opening the\nlid of the coffee-pot, and clapping it to with force, after a glance\ninside.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's where Mrs. Green wouldn't agree with you. Perhaps because it\nwould make the bold things happy to have masters, though she does n't\nsay so. Probably she wants the women to have women doctors so they won't\nbe so well, and can have more time to think whether they have been good\nor not. You ought to hear some of the ladies over there talk, mother.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have heard enough of their talk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you ought to hear Miss Gleason. There are very few things that\nMiss Gleason does n't think can be done with cut flowers, from a wedding\nto a funeral.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Mulbridge perceived that her son was speaking figuratively of Miss\nGleason's sentimentality, but she was not very patient with the sketch\nhe, enjoyed giving of her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs she a friend of that Breen girl's?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\ninterrupted to ask.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's an humble friend, an admirer, a worshipper. The Breen girl is her\nideal woman. She thinks the Breen girl is so superior to any man living\nthat she would like to make a match for her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His mother glanced sharply\nat him, but he went on in the tone of easy generalization, and with a\ncertain pleasure in the projection of these strange figures against\nher distorting imagination: \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, mother, that the most advanced\nthinkers among those ladies are not so very different, after all, from\nyou old-fashioned people. When they try to think of the greatest good\nfortune that can befall an ideal woman, it is to have her married. The\nonly trouble is to find a man good enough; and if they can't find one,\nthey're apt to invent one. They have strong imaginations.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think they would make you sick, amongst them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his\nmother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you going to have anything more to eat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, with a\nhousekeeper's latent impatience to get her table cleared away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Mulbridge; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have n't finished yet. And I'm in no hurry\nthis morning. Sit still, mother; I want you to hear something more about\nmy lady friends at Jocelyn's. Dr. Breen's mother and Miss Gleason don't\nfeel alike about her. Her mother thinks she was weak in giving up Mrs.\nMaynard's case to me; but Miss Gleason told me about their discussion,\nand she thinks it is the great heroic act of Dr. Breen's life.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt showed some sense, at least,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Mulbridge replied. She had\ntacitly offered to release her son from telling her anything when she\nhad made her motion to rise; if he chose to go on now, it was his own\naffair. She handed him the plate of biscuit, and he took one.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt showed inspiration, Miss Gleason says. The tears came into her eyes;\nI understood her to say it was godlike. 'And only to think, doctor,'\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\ncontinued, with a clumsy, but unmistakable suggestion of Miss Gleason's\nperfervid manner, \u00e2\u0080\u009c'that such a girl should be dragged down by her own\nmother to the level of petty, every-day cares and duties, and should\nbe blamed for the most beautiful act of self-sacrifice! Is n't it too\nbad?'\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRufus, Rufus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried his mother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't stun' it! Stop!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Dr. Breen is n't so bad--not half so divine as Miss Gleason thinks\nher. And Mrs. Maynard does n't consider her surrendering the case an act\nof self-sacrifice at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should hope not!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Mulbridge. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess she would n't have\nbeen alive to tell the tale, if it had n't been for you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you can't be sure of that. You must n't believe too much in\ndoctors, mother. Mrs. Maynard is pretty tough. And she's had wonderfully\ngood nursing. You've only heard the Barlow side of the matter,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said\nher sun, betraying now for the first time that he had been aware of any\nknowledge of it on her part. That was their way: though they seldom told\neach other anything, and went on as if they knew nothing of each other's\naffairs, yet when they recognized this knowledge it was without surprise\non either side. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI could tell you a different story. She's a very\nfine girl, mother; cool and careful under instruction, and perfectly\ntractable and intelligent. She's as different from those other women\nyou've seen as you are. You would like her!\u00e2\u0080\u009d He had suddenly grown\nearnest, and crushing the crust of a biscuit in the strong left hand\nwhich he rested on the table, he gazed keenly at her undemonstrative\nface. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's no baby, either. She's got a will and a temper of her own.\nShe's the only one of them I ever saw that was worth her salt.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you did n't like self-willed women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his mother\nimpassively.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe knows when to give up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, with unrelaxed scrutiny.\n\nHis mother did not lift her eyes, yet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow long shall you have to visit\nover there?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've made my last professional visit.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhere are you going this morning?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo Jocelyn's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Mulbridge now looked up, and met her son's eye. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat makes you\nthink she'll have you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe did not shrink at her coming straight to the point the moment the way\nwas clear. He had intended it, and he liked it. But he frowned a little\nas he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I want her to have me, for one thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His jaw\nclosed heavily, but his face lost a certain brutal look almost as\nquickly as it had assumed it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a smile, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat\nit's the only reason I've got.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou no need to say that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his mother, resenting the implication\nthat any woman would not have him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I'm not pretty to look at, mother, and I'm not particularly young;\nand for a while I thought there might be some one, else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe young fellow that came with her, that day.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat whipper-snapper?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Mulbridge assented by his silence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I guess I was mistaken. I\nguess he's tried and missed it. The field is 'clear, for all I can see.\nAnd she's made a failure in one way, and then you know a woman is in\nthe humor to try it in another. She wants a good excuse for giving up.\nThat's what I think.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his mother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume you know what you're about, Rufus!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe took up the coffee-pot on the lid of which she had been keeping her\nhand, and went into the kitchen with it. She removed the dishes, and\nleft him sitting before the empty table-cloth. When she came for that,\nhe took hold of her hand, and looked up into her face, over which a\nscarcely discernible tremor passed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's what I always knew I had got to come to, first or last. And I\nsuppose I ought to feel glad enough I did n't have to come to it at\nfirst.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said her son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm not a stripling any longer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He laughed,\nkeeping his mother's hand.\n\nShe freed it and taking up the table-cloth folded it lengthwise and then\nacross, and laid it neatly away in the cupboard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI sha'n't interfere\nwith you, nor any woman that you bring here to be your wife. I've had my\nday, and I'm not one of the old fools that think they're going to have\nand to hold forever. You've always been a good boy to me, and I guess\nyou hain't ever had to complain' of your mother stan'in' in your way. I\nsha'n't now. But I did think--\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe stopped and shut her lips firmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpeak up, mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess I better not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, setting her chair back against the\nwall.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what you mean. You mean about my laughing at women that try\nto take men's places in the world. Well, I did laugh at them. They're\nridiculous. I don't want to marry this girl because she's a doctor.\nThat was the principal drawback, in my mind. But it does n't make any\ndifference, and wouldn't now, if she was a dozen doctors.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis mother let down the leaves of the table, and pushed it against the\nwall, and he rose from the chair in which he was left sitting in the\nmiddle of the room. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, with her back toward him, as\nshe straightened the table accurately against the mopboard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you\ncan let me have the little house at Grant's Corner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, mother!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't suppose I should ever let you be\nturned out of house and home? You can stay here as long as you live. But\nit has n't come to that, yet. I don't know that she cares anything about\nme. But there are chances, and there are signs. The chances are that\nshe won't have the courage to take up her plan of life again, and that\nshe'll consider any other that's pressed home upon her. And I take it\nfor a good sign that she's sent that fellow adrift. If her mind had n't\nbeen set on some one else, she'd have taken him, in this broken-up state\nof hers. Besides, she has formed the habit of doing what I say, and\nthere's a great deal in mere continuity of habit. It will be easier for\nher to say yes than to say no; it would be very hard for her to say no.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nWhile he eagerly pressed these arguments his mother listened stonily,\nwithout apparent interest or sympathy. But at the end she asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\nare you going to support a wife? Your practice here won't do it. Has she\ngot anything?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe has property, I believe,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied her son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe seems to have been\nbrought up in that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe won't want to come and live here, then. She'll have notions of her\nown. If she's like the rest of them, she'll never have you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she were like the rest of them, I'd never have her. But she is n't.\nAs far as I'm concerned, it's nothing against her that she's studied\nmedicine. She did n't do it from vanity, or ambition, or any abnormal\nlove of it. She did it, so far so I can find out, because she wished\nto do good that way. She's been a little notional, she's had her head\naddled by women's talk, and she's in a queer freak; but it's only a\ngirl's freak after all: you can't say anything worse of her. She's\na splendid woman, and her property's neither here nor there. I could\nsupport her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI presume,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied his mother, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat she's been used to ways that\nain't like our ways. I've always stuck up for you, Rufus, stiff enough,\nI guess; but I ain't agoin' to deny that you're country born and bred. I\ncan see that, and she can see it, too. It makes a great difference with\ngirls. I don't know as she'd call you what they call a gentleman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Mulbridge flushed angrily. Every American, of whatever standing or\nbreeding, thinks of himself as a gentleman, and nothing can gall him\nmore than the insinuation that he is less. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you mean, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou hain't ever been in such ladies' society as hers in the same way.\nI know that they all think the world of you, and flatter you up, and\nthey're as biddable as you please when you're doctorin' 'em; but I guess\nit would be different if you was to set up for one of their own kind\namongst 'em.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is n't one of them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he retorted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I don't believe I could\nhave for the turn of my hand, especially if it was doubled into a fist.\nThey like force.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you've only seen the sick married ones. I guess you'll find a well\ngirl is another thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey're all alike. And I think I should be something of a relief if I\nwas n't like what she's been used to hearing called a gentleman;\nshe'd prefer me on that account. But if you come to blood, I guess\nthe Mulbridges and Gardiner, can hold up their heads with the best,\nanywhere.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, like the Camfers and Rafllins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These were people of ancestral\nconsequence and local history, who had gone up to Boston from Corbitant,\nand had succeeded severally as green-grocers and retail dry-goods men,\nwith the naturally attendant social distinction.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPshaw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried her son. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf she cares for me at all, she won't care for\nthe cut of my clothes, or my table manners.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, that's so. 'T ain't on my account that I want you should make sure\nshe doos care.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe looked hard at her immovable face, with its fallen eyes, and then\nwent out of the room. He never quarrelled with his mother, because\nhis anger, like her own, was dumb, and silenced him as it mounted. Her\nmisgivings had stung him deeply, and at the bottom of his indolence and\nindifference was a fiery pride, not easily kindled, but unquenchable.\nHe flung the harness upon his old unkempt horse, and tackled him to the\nmud-encrusted buggy, for whose shabbiness he had never cared before.\nHe was tempted to go back into the house, and change his uncouth Canada\nhomespun coat for the broadcloth frock which he wore when he went to\nBoston; but he scornfully resisted it, and drove off in his accustomed\nfigure.\n\nHis mother's last words repeated themselves to him, and in that\ndialogue, in which he continued to dramatize their different feelings,\nhe kept replying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, the way to find out whether she cares is to ask\nher.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nDuring her convalescence Mrs. Maynard had the time and inclination to\ngive Grace some good advice. She said that she had thought a great deal\nabout it throughout her sickness, and she had come to the conclusion\nthat Grace was throwing away her life.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're not fit to be a doctor, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou're too nervous,\nand you're too conscientious. It is n't merely your want of experience.\nNo matter how much experience you had, if you saw a case going wrong in\nyour hands, you'd want to call in some one else to set it right. Do you\nsuppose Dr. Mulbridge would have given me up to another doctor because\nhe was afraid he couldn't cure me? No, indeed! He'd have let me die\nfirst, and I should n't have blamed him. Of course I know what pressure\nI brought to bear upon you, but you had no business to mind me. You\noughtn't to have minded my talk any more than the buzzing of a mosquito,\nand no real doctor would. If he wants to be a success, he must be\nhard-hearted; as hard-hearted as\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she paused for a comparison, and\nfailing any other added--\u00e2\u0080\u009cas all possessed.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To the like large-minded\nand impartial effect, she, ran on at great length. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, Grace,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nconcluded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat you want to do is to get married. You would be a good\nwife, and you would be a good mother. The only trouble is that I don't\nknow any man worthy of you, or half worthy. No, I don't!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNow that her recovery was assured, Mrs. Maynard was very forgiving and\nsweet and kind with every one. The ladies who came in to talk with her\nsaid that she was a changed creature; she gave them all the best advice,\nand she had absolutely no shame whatever for the inconsistency involved\nby her reconciliation with her husband. She rather flaunted the\nhappiness of her reunion in the face of the public, and she vouchsafed\nan explanation to no one. There had never been anything definite in her\ncharges against him, even to Grace, and her tacit withdrawal of them\nsucceeded perfectly well. The ladies, after some cynical tittering,\nforgot them, and rejoiced in the spectacle of conjugal harmony afforded\nthem: women are generous creatures, and there is hardly any offence\nwhich they are not willing another woman should forgive her husband,\nwhen once they have said that they do not see how she could ever forgive\nhim.\n\nMrs. Maynard's silence seemed insufficient to none but Mrs. Breen and\nher own husband. The former vigorously denounced its want of logic to\nGrace as all but criminal, though she had no objection to Mr. Maynard.\nHe, in fact, treated her with a filial respect which went far to efface\nher preconceptions; and he did what he could to retrieve himself from\nthe disgrace of a separation in Grace's eyes. Perhaps he thought that\nthe late situation was known to her alone, when he casually suggested,\none day, that Mrs. Maynard was peculiar.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace mercifully; \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut she has been out of health so long.\nThat makes a great difference. She's going to be better now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it's going to come out all right in the end,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with his\nunbuoyant hopefulness, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I reckon I've got to help it along. Why, I\nsuppose every man's a trial at times, doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI dare say. I know that every woman is,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said the girl.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that so? Well, may be you're partly right. But you don't suppose but\nwhat a man generally begins it, do you? There was Adam, you know. He did\nn't pull the apple; but he fell off into that sleep, and woke up\nwith one of his ribs dislocated, and that's what really commenced the\ntrouble. If it had n't been for Adam, there would n't have been any\nwoman, you know; and you could n't blame her for what happened after she\ngot going?\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was no gleam of insinuation in his melancholy eye, and\nGrace listened without quite knowing what to make of it all. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd then\nI suppose he was n't punctual at meals, and stood round talking politics\nat night, when he ought to have been at home with his family?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d asked Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAdam,\u00e2\u0080\u009d replied Mr. Maynard lifelessly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, they got along pretty\nwell outside,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he continued. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSome of the children didn't turn out just\nwhat you might have expected; but raising children is mighty uncertain\nbusiness. Yes, they got along.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He ended his parable with a sort of\nweary sigh, as if oppressed by experience. Grace looked at his slovenly\nfigure, his smoky complexion, and the shaggy outline made by his\nuntrimmed hair and beard, and she wondered how Louise could marry him;\nbut she liked him, and she was willing to accept for all reason the\ncause of unhappiness at which he further hinted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see, doctor, an\nincompatibility is a pretty hard thing to manage. You can't forgive it\nlike a real grievance. You have to try other things, and find out that\nthere are worse things, and then you come back to it and stand it. We're\ntalking Wyoming and cattle range, now, and Mrs. Maynard is all for the\nnew deal; it's going to make us healthy, wealthy, and wise. Well, I\nsuppose the air will be good for her, out there. You doctors are sending\nlots of your patients our way, now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The gravity with which he always\nassumed that Grace was a physician in full and regular practice would\nhave had its edge of satire, coming from another; but from him, if it\nwas ironical, it was also caressing, and she did not resent it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI've\nhad some talk with your colleague, here, Dr. Mulbridge, and he seems to\nthink it will be the best thing for her. I suppose you agree with him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009chis opinion would be of great value. It wouldn't\nbe at all essential that I should agree with him:'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I don't know about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maynard. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI reckon he thinks a\ngood deal of your agreeing with him. I've been talking with him about\nsettling out our way. We've got a magnificent country, and there's bound\nto be plenty of sickness there, sooner or later. Why, doctor, it would\nbe a good opening for you! It 's just the place for you. You 're off\nhere in a corner, in New England, and you have n't got any sort of\nscope; but at Cheyenne you'd have the whole field to yourself; there is\nn't another lady doctor in Cheyenne. Now, you come out with us. Bring\nyour mother with you, and grow up with the country. Your mother\nwould like it. There's enough moral obliquity in Cheyenne to keep her\nconscience in a state of healthful activity all the time. Yes, you'd get\nalong out there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace laughed, and shook her head. It was part of the joke which life\nseemed to be with Mr. Maynard that the inhabitants of New England were\nall eager to escape from their native section, and that they ought to be\npitied and abetted in this desire. As soon as his wife's convalescence\nreleased him from constant attendance upon her, he began an inspection\nof the region from the compassionate point of view; the small, frugal\nhusbandry appealed to his commiseration, and he professed to have found\nthe use of canvas caps upon the haycocks intolerably pathetic. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy,\nI'm told,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat they have to blanket the apple-trees while the\nfruit is setting; and they kill off our Colorado bugs by turning them\nloose, one at a time, on the potato-patches: the bug starves to death\nin forty-eight hours. But you've got plenty of schoolhouses, doctor; it\ndoes beat all, about the schoolhouses. And it's an awful pity that there\nare no children to go to school in them. Why, of course the people go\nWest as fast as they can, but they ought to be helped; the Government\nought to do something. They're good people; make first-rate citizens\nwhen you get them waked up, out there. But they ought all to be got\naway, and let somebody run New England' as a summer resort. It's pretty,\nand it's cool and pleasant, and the fishing is excellent; milk, eggs,\nand all kinds of berries and historical associations on the premises;\nand it could be made very attractive three months of the year; but my\ngoodness! you oughtn't to ask anybody to live here. You come out with\nus, doctor, and see that country, and you'll know what I mean.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis boasts were always uttered with a wan, lack-lustre irony, as if\nhe were burlesquing the conventional Western brag and enjoying the\nmystifications of his listener, whose feeble sense of humor often failed\nto seize his intention, and to whom any depreciation of New England was\nnaturally unintelligible. She had not come to her final liking for him\nwithout a season of serious misgiving, but after that she rested\nin peace upon what every one knowing him felt to be his essential\nneighborliness. Her wonder had then come to be how he could marry\nLouise, when they sat together on the seaward piazza, and he poured out\nhis easy talk, unwearied and unwearying, while, with one long, lank leg\ncrossed upon the other, he swung his unblacked, thin-soled boot to and\nfro.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, he was this kind of a fellow: When we were in Switzerland, he was\nalways climbing some mountain or other. They could n't have hired me to\nclimb one of their mountains if they'd given me all their scenery, and\nthrown their goitres in. I used to tell him that the side of a house was\ngood enough for me. But nothing but the tallest mountains would do him;\nand one day when he was up there on the comb of the roof somewhere, tied\nwith a rope round his waist to the guide and a Frenchman, the guide's\nfoot slipped, and he commenced going down. The Frenchman was just going\nto cut the rope and let the guide play it alone; but he knocked the\nknife out of his hand with his long-handled axe, and when the jerk came\nhe was on the other side of the comb, where he could brace himself, and\nbrought them both up standing. Well, he's got muscles like bunches of\nsteel wire. Did n't he ever tell you about it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace sadly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, somebody ought to expose Libby. I don't suppose I should ever\nhave known about it myself, if I hadn't happened to see the guide's\nfriends and relations crying over him next day as if he was the guide's\nfuneral. Hello! There's the doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He unlimbered his lank legs, and\nrose with an effect of opening his person like a pocket-knife. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I\nunderstand it, this is an unprofessional visit, and the doctor is\nhere among us as a guest. I don't know exactly what to do under the\ncircumstances, whether we ought to talk about Mrs. Maynard's health or\nthe opera; but I reckon if we show our good intentions it will come out\nall right in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe went forward to meet the doctor, who came up to shake hands with\nGrace, and then followed him in-doors to see Mrs. Maynard. Grace\nremained in her place, and she was still sitting there when Dr.\nMulbridge returned without him. He came directly to her, and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwant to speak with you, Miss Breen. Can I see you alone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs--is Mrs. Maynard worse?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, rising in a little trepidation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; it has nothing to do with her. She's practically well now; I\ncan remand the case to you. I wish to see you--about yourself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She\nhesitated at this peculiar summons, but some pressure was upon her to\nobey Dr. Mulbridge, as there was upon most people where he wished to\nobey him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI want to talk with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout what you are going\nto do,--about your future. Will you come?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered; and she suffered him to lead the way down from\nthe piazza, and out upon one of the sandy avenues toward the woods, in\nwhich it presently lost itself. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there will be very little to talk\nabout,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued, as they moved away, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you confine yourself to\nmy future. I have none.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see how you've got rid of it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he rejoined. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou've got a\nfuture as much as you have a past, and there's this advantage,--that you\ncan do something with your future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you think so?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked, with a little bitterness. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat has n't\nbeen my experience.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's been mine,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand you can make it yours. Come, I want\nto talk with you about your future, because I have been thinking very\nseriously about my own. I want to ask your advice and to give you mine.\nI'll commence by asking yours. What do you think of me as a physician? I\nknow you are able to judge.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was flattered, in spite of herself. There were long arrears of cool\nindifference to her own claims in that direction, which she might very\nwell have resented; but she did not. There was that flattery in his\nquestion which the junior in any vocation feels in the appeal of his\nsenior; and there was the flattery which any woman feels in a man's\nrecourse to her judgment. Still, she contrived to parry it with a little\nthrust. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't suppose the opinion of a mere homoeopathist can be of\nany value to a regular practitioner.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have been a regular practitioner yourself for the last\nthree weeks. What do you think of my management of the case?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have never abandoned my principles,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I know all about that? What do you think of me as a doctor?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\npersisted.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I admire you. Why do you ask me that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I wished to know. And because I wished to ask you something\nelse. You have been brought up in a city, and I have always lived here\nin the country, except the two years I was out with the army. Do you\nthink I should succeed if I pulled up here, and settled in Boston?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have not lived in Boston,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMy opinion wouldn't be\nworth much on that point.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it would. You know city people, and what they are. I have seen a\ngood deal of them in my practice at the hotels about here, and some of\nthe ladies--when they happened to feel more comfortable--have advised\nme to come to Boston.\u00e2\u0080\u009d His derision seemed to throw contempt on all\nher sex; but he turned to her, and asked again earnestly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you\nthink? Some of the profession know me there. When I left the school,\nsome of the faculty urged me to try my chance in the city.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe waited a moment before she answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that I must respect\nyour skill, and I believe that you could succeed anywhere. I judge\nyour fitness by my own deficiency. The first time I saw you with Mrs.\nMaynard, I saw that you had everything that I hadn't. I saw that I was\na failure, and why, and that it would be foolish for me to keep up the\nstruggle.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you mean that you have given it up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he demanded, with a triumph in\nwhich there was no sympathy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt has given me up. I never liked it,--I told you that before,--and I\nnever took it up from any ambitious motive. It seemed a shame for me to\nbe of no use in the world; and I hoped that I might do something in a\nway that seemed natural for women. And I don't give up because I'm\nunfit as a woman. I might be a man, and still be impulsive and timid and\nnervous, and everything that I thought I was not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, you might be all that, and be a man; but you'd be an exceptional\nman, and I don't think you're an exceptional woman. If you've failed, it\nis n't your temperament that's to blame.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think it is. The wrong is somewhere in me individually. I know it\nis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDr. Mulbridge, walking beside her, with his hands clasped behind him,\nthrew up his head and laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, have it your own way, Miss Breen.\nOnly I don't agree with you. Why should you wish to spare your sex at\nyour own expense? But that's the way with some ladies, I've noticed.\nThey approve of what women attempt because women attempt it, and they\nbelieve the attempt reflects honor on them. It's tremendous to think\nwhat men could accomplish for their sex, if they only hung together as\nwomen do. But they can't. They haven't the generosity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think you don't understand me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace, with a severity that\namused him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wished to regard myself, in taking up this profession,\nentirely as I believed a man would have regarded himself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd were you able to do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she unintentionally replied to this unexpected question.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaw, haw, haw!\u00e2\u0080\u009d laughed Dr. Mulbridge at her helpless candor. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd are\nyou sure that you give it up as a man would?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know how you mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, vexed and bewildered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo you do it fairly and squarely because you believe that you're a\nfailure, or because you partly feel that you have n't been fairly dealt\nwith?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI believe that if Mrs. Maynard had had the same confidence in me that\nshe would have had in any man I should not have failed. But every\nwoman physician has a double disadvantage that I hadn't the strength to\novercome,--her own inexperience and the distrust of other women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, whose fault is that?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot the men's. It is the men alone who give women any chance. They are\nkind and generous and liberal-minded. I have no blame for them, and I\nhave no patience with women who want to treat them as the enemies of\nwomen's advancement. Women can't move a step forwards without their\nsufferance and help. Dr. Mulbridge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to apologize\nfor the hasty and silly words I used to you the day I came to ask you to\nconsult with me. I ought to have been grateful to you for consenting at\nfirst, and when you took back your consent I ought to have considered\nyour position. You were entirely right. We had no common ground to meet\non, and I behaved like a petulant, foolish, vulgar girl!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he protested, laughing in recollection of the scene. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were\nall right, and I was in a fix; and if your own fears had n't come to the\nrescue, I don't know how I should have got out of it. It would have been\ndisgraceful, wouldn't it, to refuse a lady's request. You don't know how\nnear I was to giving way. I can tell you, now that it's all over. I had\nnever seen a lady of our profession before,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added hastily, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand\nmy curiosity was up. I always had my doubts about the thoroughness\nof women's study, and I should have liked to see where your training\nfailed. I must say I found it very good,--I've told you that. You\nwouldn't fail individually: you would fail because you are a woman.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't believe that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, because your patients are women. It's all one. What will\nyou do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shall not do anything. I shall give it all up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut what shall you do then?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI--don't know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat are you going to be? A fashionable woman? Or are you going to\nEurope, and settle down there with the other American failures? I've\nheard about them,--in Rome and Florence and Paris. Are you going to\nthrow away the study you've put into this profession? You took it up\nbecause you wanted to do good. Don't you want to do good any more? Has\nthe human race turned out unworthy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe cowered at this arraignment, in which she could not separate the\nmocking from the justice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat do you advise me to do? Do you think I\ncould ever succeed?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou could never succeed alone.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I know that; I felt that from the first. But I have planned to\nunite with a woman physician older than myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd double your deficiency. Sit down here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said; \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish to\ntalk business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They had entered the border of the woods encompassing\nJocelyn's, and he painted to a stump, beside which lay the fallen tree.\nShe obeyed mechanically, and he remained standing near her, with one\nfoot lifted to the log; he leaned forward over her, and seemed to seize\na physical advantage in the posture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom your own point of view, you\nwould have no right to give up your undertaking if there was a chance of\nsuccess in it. You would have no more right to give up than a woman who\nhad gone out as a missionary.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't pretend to compare myself with such a woman; but I should have\nno more right to give up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, helpless against the logic of\nher fate, which he had somehow divined.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, listen to me. I can give you this chance. Are you satisfied\nthat with my advice you could have succeeded in Mrs. Maynard's case?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, I think so. But what\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think so, too. Don't rise!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis will overcame the impulse that had betrayed itself, and she sank\nback to her seat. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI offer you my advice from this time forward; I offer\nyou my help.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is very good of you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured; \u00e2\u0080\u009cand I appreciate your\ngenerosity more than I can say. I know the prejudice you must have\nhad to overcome in regard to women physicians before you could bring\nyourself to do this; and I know how you must have despised me for\nfailing in my attempt, and giving myself up to my feeble temperament.\nBut\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, we won't speak of all that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I felt the\nprejudice against women entering the profession which we all feel; it\nwas ridiculous and disgusting to me till I saw you. I won't urge you\nfrom any personal motive to accept my offer. But I know that if you do\nyou can realize all your hopes of usefulness; and I ask you to consider\nthat certainly. But you know the only way it could be done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked him in the eyes, with dismay in her growing intelligence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat--what do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI mean that I ask you to let me help you carry out your plan of life,\nand to save all you have done, and all you have hoped, from waste--as\nyour husband. Think\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nShe struggled to her feet as if he were opposing a palpable resistance,\nso strongly she felt the pressure of his will. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can't be, Dr.\nMulbridge. Oh, it can't, indeed! Let us go back; I wish to go back!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBut he had planted himself in her way, and blocked her advance, unless\nshe chose to make it a flight.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI expected this,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a smile, as if her wild trepidation\ninterested him as an anticipated symptom. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe whole idea is new and\nstartling to you. But I know you won't dismiss it abruptly, and I won't\nbe discouraged.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, yes, you must! I will not think of it! I can't! I do dismiss it at\nonce. Let me go!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you really choose to be like the rest,--a thing of hysterical\nimpulses, without conscience or reason! I supposed the weakest woman\nwould be equal to an offer of marriage. And you had dreamt of being a\nphysician and useful!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI tell you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, half quelled by his derision, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat I have\nfound out that I am not fit for it,--that I am a failure and a disgrace;\nand you had no right to expect me to be anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are no failure, and I had a right to expect anything of you after\nthe endurance and the discretion you have shown in the last three weeks.\nWithout your help I should have failed myself. You owe it to other women\nto go on.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey must take care of themselves,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf my weakness throws\nshame on them, they must bear it. I thank you for what you say. I\nbelieve you mean it. But if I was of any use to you I did n't know it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was probably inspiration, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he interrupted coolly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCome, this\nisn't a thing to be frightened at. You're not obliged to do what I say.\nBut I think you ought to hear me out. I haven't spoken without serious\nthought, and I didn't suppose you would reject me without a reason.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cReason?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she repeated. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no reason in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere ought to be. There is, on my side. I have all kinds of reasons\nfor asking you to be my wife: I believe that I can make you happy in\nthe fulfilment of your plans; I admire you and respect you more than any\nother woman I ever saw; and I love you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't love you, and that is reason enough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, between boys and girls. But between men and women it isn't enough.\nDo you dislike me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAm I repulsive in any way?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know that I am not very young and that I am not very good-looking.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is n't that at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOf course I know that such things weigh with women, and that personal\ntraits and habits are important in an affair like this. I am slovenly\nand indifferent about my dress; but it's only because I have lived where\nevery sort of spirit and ambition was useless. I don't know about city\nways, but I could pick up all of them that were worth while. I spoke of\ngoing to Boston; but I would go anywhere else with you, east or west,\nthat you chose, and I know that I should succeed. I haven't done what I\nmight have done with myself, because I've never had an object in life.\nI've always lived in the one little place, and I've never been out of\nit except when I was in the army. I've always liked my profession; but\nnothing has seemed worth while. You were a revelation to me; you have\nput ambition and hope into me. I never saw any woman before that I would\nhave turned my hand to have. They always seemed to me fit to be\nthe companions of fools, or the playthings of men. But of all the\nsimpletons, the women who were trying to do something for woman, as they\ncalled it, trying to exemplify and illustrate a cause, were the silliest\nthat I came across. I never happened to have met a woman doctor before\nyou came to me; but I had imagined them, and I could n't believe in you\nwhen I saw you. You were not supersensitive, you were not presumptuous,\nand you gave up, not because you distrusted yourself, but because your\npatient distrusted you. That was right: I should have done the same\nthing myself. Under my direction, you have shown yourself faithful,\ndocile, patient, intelligent beyond anything I have seen. I have watched\nyou, and I know; and I know what your peculiar trials have been from\nthat woman. You have taught me a lesson,--I 'm not ashamed to say it;\nand you've given me a motive. I was wrong to ask you to marry me so that\nyou might carry out your plans: that was no way to appeal to you. What\nI meant was that I might make your plans my own, and that we might carry\nthem out together. I don't care for making money; I have always been\npoor, and I had always expected to be so; and I am not afraid of hard\nwork. There is n't any self-sacrifice you've dreamed of that I wouldn't\ngladly and proudly share with you. You can't do anything by yourself,\nbut we could do anything together. If you have any scruple about giving\nup your theory of medicine, you needn't do it; and the State Medical\nAssociation may go to the devil. I've said my say. What do you say?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe looked all round, as if seeking escape from a mesh suddenly flung\nabout her, and then she looked imploringly up at him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have nothing to\nsay,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she whispered huskily. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't answer you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, that's all I ask,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, moving a few steps, away, and\nsuffering her to rise. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't answer me now. Take time,--all the time\nyou want, all the time there is.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, rising, and gathering some strength from the sense of\nbeing on foot again. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't mean that. I mean that I don't--I can't\nconsent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou don't believe in me? You don't think I would do it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't believe in myself. I have no right to doubt you. I know that I\nought to honor you for what you propose.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think it calls for any great honor. Of course I shouldn't\npropose it to every lady physician.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He smiled with entire serenity\nand self-possession. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTell me one thing: was there ever a time when you\nwould have consented?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She did not answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you will consent yet?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. Don't deceive yourself. I shall never consent.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'll leave that to the logic of your own conscience. You will do what\nseems your duty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must n't trust to my conscience. I fling it away! I won't have\nanything to do with it. I've been tortured enough by it. There is no\nsense or justice in it!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed easily at her vehemence. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI 'll trust your conscience. But I\nwon't stay to worry you now. I'm coming again day after to-morrow, and\nI'm not afraid of what you will say then.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe turned and left her, tearing his way through the sweet-fern and low\nblackberry vines, with long strides, a shape of uncouth force. After he\nwas out of sight, she followed, scared and trembling at herself, as if\nshe had blasphemed.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nGrace burst into the room where her mother sat; and flung her hat aside\nwith a desperate gesture. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNow, mother, you have got to listen to me.\nDr. Mulbridge has asked me to marry him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Green put up her spectacles on her forehead, and stared at her\ndaughter, while some strong expressions, out of the plebeian or rustic\npast which lies only a generation or two behind most of us, rose to her\nlips. I will not repeat them here; she had long denied them to herself\nas an immoral self-indulgence, and it must be owned that such things\nhave a fearful effect, coming from old ladies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat has got into all\nthe men? What in nature does he want you to marry him for?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, for the best reasons in the world,\u00e2\u0080\u009d exclaimed the daughter.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor reasons that will make you admire and respect him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added\nironically. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFor great, and unselfish, and magnanimous reasons!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should want to believe they were the real ones, first,\u00e2\u0080\u009d interrupted\nMrs. Breen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe wants to marry me because he knows that I can't fulfil my plans of\nlife alone, and because we could fulfil them together. We shall not only\nbe husband and wife, but we shall be physicians in partnership. I may\ncontinue a homoeopath, he says, and the State Medical Association may go\nto the devil.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She used his language, that would have been shocking to\nher ordinary moods, without blenching, and in their common agitation her\nmother accepted it as fit and becoming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe counts upon my accepting him\nbecause I must see it as my duty, and my conscience won't let me reject\nthe only opportunity I shall have of doing some good and being of some\nuse in the world. What do you think I ought to do, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere's reason in what he says. It is an opportunity. You could be of\nuse, in that way, and perhaps it's the only way. Yes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she continued,\nfascinated by the logic of the position, and its capabilities for\nvicarious self-sacrifice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't see how you can get out of it: You\nhave spent years and years of study, and a great deal of money, to\neducate yourself for a profession that you're too weak to practise\nalone. You can't say that I ever advised your doing it. It was your\nown idea, and I did n't oppose it. But when you've gone so far, you've\nformed an obligation to go on. It's your duty not to give up, if you\nknow of any means to continue. That's your duty, as plain as can be. To\nsay nothing of the wicked waste of your giving up now, you're bound to\nconsider the effect it would have upon other women who are trying to\ndo something for themselves. The only thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added, with some\nmisgiving, \u00e2\u0080\u009cis whether you believe he was in earnest and would keep his\nword to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think he was secretly laughing at me, and that he would expect to\nlaugh me out of his promise.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, you ought to take time to reflect, and you ought to be sure\nthat you're right about him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that what you really think, mother?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am always governed by reason, Grace, and by right; and I have brought\nyou up on that plan. If you have ever departed from it, it has not been\nwith my consent, nor for want of my warning. I have simply laid the\nmatter before you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen you wish me to marry him?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis was perhaps a point that had not occurred to Mrs. Breen in her\nrecognition of the strength of Dr. Mulbridge's position. It was one\nthing to trace the path of duty; another to support the aspirant in\ntreading it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou ought to take time to reflect,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mrs. Green repeated,\nwith evasion that she never used in behalf of others.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, mother,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI didn't take time to reflect, and\nI should n't care whether I was right about him or not. I refused him\nbecause I did n't love him. If I had loved him that would have been\nthe only reason I needed to marry him. But all the duty in the world\nwouldn't be enough without it. Duty? I am sick of duty! Let the other\nwomen who are trying to do something for themselves, take care of\nthemselves as men would. I don't owe them more than a man would owe\nother men, and I won't be hoodwinked into thinking I do. As for the\nwaste, the past is gone, at any rate; and the waste that I lament is the\nyears I spent in working myself up to an undertaking that I was never\nfit for. I won't continue that waste, and I won't keep up the delusion\nthat because I was very unhappy I was useful, and that it was doing good\nto be miserable. I like pleasure and I like dress; I like pretty things.\nThere is no harm in them. Why should n't I have them?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is harm in them for you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d--her mother began.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I have tried to make my life a horror? There is no other\nreason, and that is no reason. When we go into Boston this winter I\nshall go to the theatre. I shall go to the opera, and I hope there\nwill be a ballet. And next summer, I am going to Europe; I am going to\nItaly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She whirled away toward the door as if she were setting out.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI should think you had taken leave of your conscience!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried her\nmother.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope I have, mother. I am going to consult my reason after this.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour reason!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, then, my inclination. I have had enough of conscience,--of my\nown, and of yours, too. That is what I told him, and that is what\nI mean. There is such a thing as having too much conscience, and of\ngetting stupefied by it, so that you can't really see what's right. But\nI don't care. I believe I should like to do wrong for a while, and I\nwill do wrong if it's doing right to marry him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe had her hand on the door-knob, and now she opened the door, and\nclosed it after her with something very like a bang.\n\nShe naturally could not keep within doors in this explosive state, and\nshe went downstairs, and out upon the piazza. Mr. Maynard was there,\nsmoking, with his boots on top of the veranda-rail, and his person\nthrown back in his chair at the angle requisite to accomplish this\nelevation of the feet. He took them down, as he saw her approach, and\nrose, with the respect in which he never failed for women, and threw his\ncigar away.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Maynard,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked abruptly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdo you know where Mr. Libby is?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I don't, doctor, I'm sorry to say. If I did, I would send and\nborrow some more cigars of him. I think that the brand our landlord\nkeeps must have been invented by Mr. Track, the great anti-tobacco\nreformer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs he coming back? Is n't he coming back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded breathlessly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy, yes, I reckon he must be coming back. Libby generally sees his\nfriends through. And he'll have some curiosity to know how Mrs. Maynard\nand I have come out of it all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He looked at her with something latent\nin his eye; but what his eye expressed was merely a sympathetic regret\nthat he could not be more satisfactory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she suggested, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMr. Barlow might know something.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Maynard, \u00e2\u0080\u009cperhaps he might, that very thing. I'll\ngo round and ask him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He went to the stable, and she waited for his\nreturn. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBarlow says,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he reported, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat he guesses he's somewhere\nabout Leyden. At any rate, his mare,'s there yet, in the stable where\nBarlow left her. He saw her there, yesterday.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThanks. That's all I wished to know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Grace. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wished to write to\nhim,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added boldly.\n\nShe shut herself in her room and spent the rest of the forenoon in\nwriting a letter, which when first finished was very long, but in its\nultimate phase was so short as to occupy but a small space on a\nsquare correspondence-card. Having got it written on the card, she\nwas dissatisfied with it in that shape, and copied it upon a sheet\nof note-paper. Then she sealed and addressed it, and put it into her\npocket; after dinner she went down to the beach, and walked a long way\nupon the sands. She thought at first that she would ask Barlow to get\nit to him, somehow; and then she determined to find out from Barlow the\naddress of the people who had Mr. Libby's horse, and send it to them\nfor him by the driver of the barge. She would approach the driver with a\nnonchalant, imperious air, and ask him to please have that delivered\nto Mr. Libby immediately; and in case he learned from the stable-people\nthat he was not in Leyden, to bring the letter back to her. She saw how\nthe driver would take it, and then she figured Libby opening and reading\nit. She sometimes figured him one way, and sometimes another. Sometimes\nhe rapidly scanned the lines, and then instantly ordered his horse, and\nfeverishly hastened the men; again he deliberately read it, and then\ntore it into stall pieces, with a laugh, and flung them away. This\nconception of his behavior made her heart almost stop beating; but there\nwas a luxury in it, too, and she recurred to it quite as often as to the\nother, which led her to a dramatization of their meeting, with all\ntheir parley minutely realized, and every most intimate look and thought\nimagined. There is of course no means of proving that this sort of\nmental exercise was in any degree an exercise of the reason, or that Dr.\nBreen did not behave unprofessionally in giving herself up to it. She\ncould only have claimed in self-defence that she was no longer aiming\nat a professional behavior; that she was in fact abandoning herself to\na recovered sense of girlhood and all its sweetest irresponsibilities.\nThose who would excuse so weak and capricious a character may urge, if\nthey like, that she was behaving as wisely as a young physician of the\nother sex would have done in the circumstances.\n\nShe concluded to remain on the beach, where only the children were\nplaying in the sand, and where she could easily escape any other\ncompanionship that threatened. After she had walked long enough to spend\nthe first passion of her reverie, she sat down under the cliff, and\npresently grew conscious of his boat swinging at anchor in its wonted\nplace, and wondered that she had not thought he must come back for that.\nThen she had a mind to tear up her letter as superfluous; but she did\nnot. She rose from her place under the cliff, and went to look for the\ndory. She found it drawn up on the sand in a little cove. It was the\nsame place, and the water was so shoal for twenty feet out that no one\ncould have rowed the dory to land; it must be dragged up. She laughed\nand blushed, and then boldly amused herself by looking for footprints;\nbut the tide must have washed them out long ago; there were only the\nlight, small footprints of the children who had been playing about the\ndory. She brushed away some sand they had scattered over the seat, and\ngot into the boat and sat down there. It was a good seat, and commanded\na view of the sail-boat in the foreground of the otherwise empty ocean;\nshe took out her letter, and let it lie in the open hands which she let\nlie in her lap.\n\nShe was not impatient to have the time pass; it went only too soon.\nThough she indulged that luxury of terror in imagining her letter torn\nup and scornfully thrown away, she really rested quite safe as to the\nevent; but she liked this fond delay, and the soft blue afternoon might\nhave lasted forever to her entire content.\n\nA little whiff of breeze stole up, and suddenly caught the letter from\nher open hands, and whisked it out over the sand. With a cry she fled\nafter it, and when she had recaptured it, she thought to look at her\nwatch. It was almost time for the barge, and now she made such needless\nhaste, in order not to give herself chance for misgiving or retreat,\nthat she arrived too soon at the point where she meant to intercept\nthe driver on his way to the house; for in her present mutiny she had\nresolved to gratify a little natural liking for manoeuvre, long starved\nby the rigid discipline to which she had subjected herself. She had\nalways been awkward at it, but she liked it; and now it pleased her to\nthink that she should give her letter secretly to the driver, and on her\nway to meet him she forgot that she had meant to ask Barlow for part of\nthe address. She did not remember this till it was too late to go back\nto the hotel, and she suddenly resolved not to consult Barlow, but to\nlet the driver go about from one place to another with the letter till\nhe found the right one. She kept walking on out into the forest through\nwhich the road wound, and she had got a mile away before she saw the\nweary bowing of the horses' heads as they tugged the barge through the\nsand at a walk. She stopped involuntarily, with some impulses to flight;\nand as the vehicle drew nearer, she saw the driver turned round upon his\nseat, and talking to a passenger behind. She had never counted upon his\nhaving a passenger, and the fact undid all.\n\nShe remained helpless in the middle of the road; the horses came to a\nstand-still a few paces from her, and the driver ceased from the high\nkey of conversation, and turned to see what was the matter.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy grief!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he shouted. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf it had n't been for them horses o' mine, I\nsh'd 'a' run right over ye.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wished to speak with you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she began. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wished to send\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\nShe stopped, and the passenger leaned forward to learn what was going\non. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMiss Breen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he exclaimed, and leaped out of the back of the barge\nand ran to her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou--you got my letter!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she gasped.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! What letter? Is there anything the matter?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not answer. She had become conscious of the letter, which she\nhad never ceased to hold in the hand that she had kept in her pocket for\nthat purpose. She crushed it into a small wad.\n\nLibby turned his head, and said to the driver of the barge, \u00e2\u0080\u009cGo ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWill you take my arm?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added to her. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's heavy walking in this\nsand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, thank you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she murmured, recoiling. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm not tired.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you well? Have you been quite well?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, perfectly. I did n't know you were coming back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. I had to come back. I'm going to Europe next week, and I had\nto come to look after my boat, here; and I wanted to say good-by to\nMaynard. I was just going to speak to Maynard, and then sail my boat\nover to Leyden.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt will be very pleasant,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said, without looking at him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's\nmoonlight now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I sha'n't have any use for the moon. I shall get over before\nnightfall, if this breeze holds.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe tried to think of something else, and to get away from this talk\nof a sail to Leyden, but she fatally answered, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI saw your boat this\nafternoon. I had n't noticed before that it was still here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe hesitated a moment, and then asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you happen to notice the\ndory?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, it was drawn up on the sand.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI suppose it's all right--if it's in the same place.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt seemed to be,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered faintly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm going to give the boat to Johnson.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not say anything, for she could think of nothing to say, but\nthat she had looked for seals on the reef, but had not seen any, and\nthis would have been too shamelessly leading. That left the word to him,\nand he asked timidly,--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope my coming don't seem intrusive, Miss Breen?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe did not heed this, but \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are going to be gone a great while?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she\nasked, in turn.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied, in an uncertain tone, as if troubled to make\nout whether she was vexed with him or not. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\nwould go up the Nile this time. I've never been up the Nile, you know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I didn't know that. Well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she added to herself, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you had\nnot come back! You had better not have come back. If you had n't come,\nyou would have got my letter. And now it can never be done! No, I can't\ngo through it all again, and no one has the right to ask it. We have\nmissed the only chance,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried to herself, in such keen reproach of\nhim that she thought she must have spoken aloud.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIs Mrs. Maynard all right again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he asked.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes, she is very much better,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, confusedly, as if he had\nheard her reproach and had ignored it.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you're not so tired as you were.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I 'm not tired now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you looked a little pale,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said sympathetically, and now\nshe saw that he was so. It irritated her that she should be so far from\nhim, in all helpfulness, and she could scarcely keep down the wish that\nached in her heart.\n\nWe are never nearer doing the thing we long to do than when we have\nproclaimed to ourselves that it must not and cannot be.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy are you so pale?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded, almost angrily.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI? I didn't know that I was,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI supposed I was pretty\nwell. I dare say I ought to be ashamed of showing it in that way. But if\nyou ask me, well, I will tell you; I don't find it any easier than I did\nat first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are to blame, then!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were a man, I should not let\nsuch a thing wear upon me for a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I dare say I shall live through it,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered, with the national\nwhimsicality that comes to our aid in most emergencies.\n\nA little pang went through her heart, but she retorted, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would n't go\nto Europe to escape it, nor up the Nile. I would stay and fight it where\nI was.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cStay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He seemed to have caught hopefully at the word.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you were stronger. If you give up in this way how can you\nexpect me\u00e2\u0080\u009d--She stopped; she hardly knew what she had intended to say;\nshe feared that he knew.\n\nBut he only said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm sorry. I didn't intend to trouble you with the\nsight of me. I had a plan for getting over the cliff without letting you\nknow, and having Maynard come down to me there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd did you really mean,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried piteously, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto go away without\ntrying to see me again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he owned simply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought I might catch a glimpse of you, but I\ndid n't expect to speak to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDid you hate me so badly as that? What had I done to you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDone?\u00e2\u0080\u009d He gave a sorrowful laugh; and added, with an absent air, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes,\nit's really like doing something to me! And sometimes it seems as if you\nhad done it purposely.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know I did n't! Now, then,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried, \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou have insulted me, and\nyou never did that before. You were very good and noble and generous,\nand would n't let me blame myself for anything. I wanted always to\nremember that of you; for I did n't believe that any man could be so\nmagnanimous. But it seems that you don't care to have me respect you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRespect?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he repeated, in the same vague way. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I should n't care\nabout that unless it was included in the other. But you know whether I\nhave accused you of anything, or whether I have insulted you. I won't\nexcuse myself. I think that ought to be insulting to your common sense.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen why should you have wished to avoid seeing me to-day? Was it to\nspare yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she demanded, quite incoherently now. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr did you think\nI should not be equal to the meeting?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know what to say to you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the young man. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI think I\nmust be crazy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He halted, and looked at her in complete bewilderment.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't understand you at all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wished to see you very much. I wanted your advice, as--as--a friend.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n He shook his head. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes! you shall be my friend, in this at least. I\ncan claim it--demand it. You had no right to--to--make me--trust you so\nmuch, and--and then--desert me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, very well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he answered. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf any advice of mine--But I couldn't go\nthrough that sacrilegious farce of being near you and not\u00e2\u0080\u009d--She waited\nbreathlessly, a condensed eternity, for him to go on; but he stopped at\nthat word, and added: \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I advise you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe disappointment was so cruel that the tears came into her eyes and\nran down her face, which she averted from him. When she could control\nherself she said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI have an opportunity of going on in my profession\nnow, in a way that makes me sure of success.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI am very glad on your account. You must be glad to realize\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she retorted wildly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI am not glad!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut there are conditions! He says he will go with me anywhere, and we\ncan practise our profession together, and I can carry out all my plans.\nBut first--first--he wants me to--marry him!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWho?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDon't you know? Dr. Mulbridge!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat--I beg your pardon. I've no right to call him names.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The young\nfellow halted, and looked at her downcast face. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, do you want me to\ntell you to take him? That is too much. I did n't know you were cruel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou make me cruel! You leave me to be cruel!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI leave you to be cruel?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don't play upon my words, if you won't ask me what I answered!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can I ask that? I have no right to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut you shall know!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told him that I had no plans. I have\ngiven them all up because--because I'm too weak for them, and because I\nabhor him, and because--But it was n't enough. He would not take what I\nsaid for answer, and he is coming again for an answer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cComing again?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes. He is a man who believes that women may change, for reason or no\nreason; and\u00e2\u0080\u009d--\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou--you mean to take him when he comes back?\u00e2\u0080\u009d gasped the young man.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNever! Not if he came a thousand times!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen what is it you want me to advise you about?\u00e2\u0080\u009d he faltered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with freezing hauteur. She suddenly put up\nher arms across her eyes, with the beautiful, artless action of a\nshame-smitten child, and left her young figure in bewildering relief.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, don't you see that I love you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCould n't you understand,--couldn't you see what I meant?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she asked\nagain that night, as they lost themselves on the long stretch of the\nmoonlit beach. With his arm close about that lovely shape they would\nhave seemed but one person to the inattentive observer, as they paced\nalong in the white splendor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI couldn't risk anything. I had spoken, once for all. I always thought\nthat for a man to offer himself twice was indelicate and unfair. I could\nnever have done it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's very sweet in you,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said; and perhaps she would have praised\nin the same terms the precisely opposite sentiment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's some comfort,\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she added, with a deep-fetched sigh, \u00e2\u0080\u009cto think I had to speak.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou didn't find it so easy to make love!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, NOTHING is easy that men have to do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, with passionate\nearnestness.\n\nThere are moments of extreme concession, of magnanimous admission, that\ncome but once in a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nDr. Mulbridge did not wait for the time he had fixed for his return. He\nmay have judged that her tendency against him would strengthen by delay,\nor he may have yielded to his own impatience in coming the next day. He\nasked for Grace with his wonted abruptness, and waited for her coming in\nthe little parlor of the hotel, walking up and down the floor, with his\nshaggy head bent forward, and his big hands clasped behind him.\n\nAs she hovered at the door before entering, she could watch him while\nhe walked the whole room's length away, and she felt a pang at sight of\nhim. If she could have believed that he loved her, she could not have\nfaced him, but must have turned and run away; and even as it was she\ngrieved for him. Such a man would not have made up his mind to this\nstep without a deep motive, if not a deep feeling. Her heart had been\nsoftened so that she could not think of frustrating his ambition, if it\nwere no better than that, without pity. One man had made her feel very\nkindly toward all other men; she wished in the tender confusion of\nthe moment that she need not reject her importunate suitor, whose\nimportunity even she could not resent.\n\nHe caught sight of her as soon as he made his turn at the end of the\nroom, and with a quick \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, Ah!\u00e2\u0080\u009d he hastened to meet her, with the smile\nin which there was certainly something attractive. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou see I've come\nback a day sooner than I promised. I haven't the sort of turnout you've\nbeen used to, but I want you to drive with me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cI can't drive with you,\nDr. Mulbridge,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she faltered.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, walk, then. I should prefer to walk.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou must excuse me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, and remained standing before him.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSit down,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he bade her, and pushed up a chair towards her. His\naudacity, if it had been a finer courage, would have been splendid, and\nas it was she helplessly obeyed him, as if she were his patient, and\nmust do so. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf I were superstitious I should say that you receive me\nominously,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, fixing his gray eyes keenly upon her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI do!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she forced herself to reply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wish you had not come.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat's explicit, at any rate. Have you thought it over?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo; I had no need to do that, I had fully resolved when I spoke\nyesterday. Dr. Mulbridge, why didn't you spare me this? It's unkind of\nyou to insist, after what I said. You know that I must hate to repeat\nit. I do value you so highly in some ways that I blame you for obliging\nme to hurt you--if it does hurt--by telling you again that I don't love\nyou.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe drew in a long breath, and set his teeth hard upon his lip. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou may\ndepend upon its hurting,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I was glad to risk the pain,\nwhatever it was, for the chance of getting you to reconsider. I presume\nI'm not the conventional wooer. I'm too old for it, and I'm too blunt\nand plain a man. I've been thirty-five years making up my mind to ask\nyou to marry me. You're the first woman, and you shall be the last. You\ncouldn't suppose I was going to give you up for one no?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou had better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot for twenty! I can understand very well how you never thought of\nme in this way; but there's no reason why you shouldn't. Come, it's a\nmatter that we can reason about, like anything else.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. I told you, it's something we can't reason about. Or yes, it is. I\nwill reason with you. You say that you love me?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you did n't love me, you would n't ask me to marry you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThen how can you expect me to marry you without loving you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't. All that I ask is that you won't refuse me. I know that you\ncan love me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, no, never!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd I only want you to take time to try.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't wish to try. If you persist, I must leave the room. We had\nbetter part. I was foolish to see you. But I thought--I was sorry--I\nhoped to make it less unkind to you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn spite of yourself, you were relenting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNot at all!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if you pitied me, you did care for me a little?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou know that I had the highest respect for you as a physician. I\ntell you that you were my ideal in that way, and I will tell you that\nif\u00e2\u0080\u009d--she stopped, and he continued for her.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you had not resolved to give it up, you might have done what I\nasked.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did not say that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered indignantly.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut why do you give it up?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I am not equal to it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHow do you know it? Who told you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have told me,--by every look and act of yours,--and I'm grateful to\nyou for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd if I told you now by word that you were fit for it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI shouldn't believe you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would n't believe my word?\u00e2\u0080\u009d She did not answer. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI see,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said\npresently, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat you doubt me somehow as a man. What is it you think of\nme?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou wouldn't like to know.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, I should.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I will tell you. I think you are a tyrant, and that you want a\nslave, not a wife. You wish to be obeyed. You despise women. I don't\nmean their minds,--they 're despicable enough, in most cases, as men's\nare,--but their nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is news to me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, laughing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI never knew that I despised\nwomen's nature.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's true, whether you knew it or not.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDo I despise you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou would, if you saw that I was afraid of you: Oh, why do you force me\nto say such things? Why don't you spare me--spare yourself?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this cause I couldn't spare myself. I can't bear to give you up!\nI'm what I am, whatever you say; but with you, I could be whatever you\nwould. I could show you that you are wrong if you gave me the chance. I\nknow that I could make you happy. Listen to me a moment.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's useless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo! If you have taken the trouble to read me in this way, there must\nhave been a time when you might have cared.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere never was any such time. I read you from the first.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will go away,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, after a pause, in which she had risen, and\nbegan a retreat towards the door. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I will not--I cannot--give you\nup. I will see you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, sir. You shall not see me again. I will not submit to it. I will\nnot be persecuted.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was trembling, and she knew that he saw her\ntremor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, with a smile that recognized her trepidation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI will\nnot persecute you. I'll renounce these pretensions. But I'll ask you to\nsee me once more, as a friend,--an acquaintance.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI will not see you again.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are rather hard with me, I think,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he urged gently. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't think\nI'm playing the tyrant with you now.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are,--the baffled tyrant.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut if I promised not to offend again, why should you deny me your\nacquaintance?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause I don't believe you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d She was getting nearer the door, and as\nshe put her hand behind her and touched the knob, the wild terror she\nhad felt, lest he should reach it first and prevent her escape, left\nher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou are treating me like a child that does n't know its own mind,\nor has none to know. You are laughing at me--playing with me; you have\nshown me that you despise me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHe actually laughed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, you've shown that you are not afraid of me.\nWhy are you not afraid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBecause,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she answered, and she dealt the blow now without pity, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm\nengaged,--engaged to Mr. Libby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d She whirled about and vanished through\nthe door, ashamed, indignant, fearing that if she had not fled, he would\nsomehow have found means to make his will prevail even yet.\n\nHe stood, stupefied, looking at the closed door, and he made a turn\nor two about the room before he summoned intelligence to quit it. When\ndeath itself comes, the sense of continuance is not at once broken in\nthe survivors. In these moral deaths, which men survive in their own\nlives, there is no immediate consciousness of an end. For a while, habit\nand the automatic tendency of desire carry them on.\n\nHe drove back to Corbitant perched on the rickety seat of his rattling\nopen buggy, and bowed forward as his wont was, his rounded shoulders\nbringing his chin well over the dashboard. As he passed down the long\nsandy street, toward the corner where his own house stood, the brooding\ngroup of loafers, waiting in Hackett's store for the distribution of the\nmail, watched him through the open door, and from under the boughs of\nthe weatherbeaten poplar before it. Hackett had been cutting a pound of\ncheese out of the thick yellow disk before him, for the Widow Holman,\nand he stared at the street after Mulbridge passed, as if his mental eye\nhad halted him there for the public consideration, while he leaned over\nthe counter, and held by the point the long knife with which he had cut\nthe cheese.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI see some the folks from over to Jocelyn's, yist'd'y,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, in\na spasm of sharp, crackling speech, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand they seemed to think 't Mis'\nMulbridge'd got to step round pretty spry 'f she did n't want another\nthe same name in the house with her.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nA long silence followed, in which no one changed in any wise the posture\nin which he found himself when Hackett began to speak. Cap'n George\nWray, tilted back against the wall in his chair, continued to stare at\nthe store-keeper; Cap'n Jabez Wray, did not look up from whittling the\nchair between his legs; their cousin, Cap'n Wray Storrell, seated on a\nnailkeg near the stove, went on fretting the rust on the pipe with the\nend of a stiff, cast-off envelope; two other captains, more or less akin\nto them, continued their game of checkers; the Widow Seth Wray's boy\nrested immovable, with his chin and hand on the counter, where he had\nbeen trying since the Widow Holman went out to catch Hackett's eye and\nbuy a corn-ball. Old Cap'n Billy Wray was the first to break the spell.\nHe took his cigar from his mouth, and held it between his shaking thumb\nand forefinger, while he pursed his lips for speech. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJabez,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said,\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cdid Cap'n Sam'l git that coalier?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered the whittler, cutting deeper into his chair, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe did n't\nsignal for him till she got into the channel, and then he'd got a couple\no' passengers for Leyden; and Cap'n Jim brought her up.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cap'n Billy, with a stiff yet tremulous reference\nof himself to the storekeeper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cas spryness would help her, as long as\nhe took the notion. I guess he's master of his own ship. Who's he going\nto marry? The grahs-widow got well enough?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo. As I understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d crackled the store-keeper, \u00e2\u0080\u009cher husband's turned\nup. Folks over there seem to think't he's got his eye on the other\ndoctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoing to marry with her, hey? Well, if either of 'em gets sick they\nwon't have to go far for advice, and they won't have any doctor's bills\nto pay. Still, I shouldn't ha' picked out just that kind of a wife for\nhim.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs I understand,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the storekeeper began; but here he caught sight of\nWidow Seth Wray's boy, and asked, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat's wanted, Bub? Corn-ball?\u00e2\u0080\u009d and\nturning to take that sweetmeat from the shelf behind him he added\nthe rest in the mouth of the hollowly reverberating jar, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe's got\nprop'ty.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I never knew a Mulbridge yet 't objected to prop'ty,--especially,\nother folks's.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBarlow he's tellin' round that she 's very fine appearin'.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He handed\nthe corn-ball to Widow Seth Wray's boy, who went noiselessly out on his\nbare feet.\n\nCap'n Billy drew several long breaths. When another man might have been\nsupposed to have dismissed the subject he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I never knew\na Mulbridge that objected to good looks in women folks. They've all\nmerried hahnsome wives, ever since the old gentleman set 'em the example\nwith his second one. They got their own looks from the first. Well,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\nadded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope she's a tough one. She's got either to bend or to break.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cap'n George Wray, like one rising from the dead to say\nit, so dumb and motionless had he been till now, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat Mis' Mulbridge\nwas too much for the old doctor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know about that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cap'n Billy replied, \u00e2\u0080\u009cbut I guess her son's\ntoo much for her: she's only Gardiner, and he's Gardiner and Mulbridge\nboth.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNo one changed countenance, but a sense of Cap'n Billy's wit sparely\nyet satisfyingly glimmered from the eyes of Cap'n George and the\nstorekeeper, and Cap'n Jabez closed his knife with a snap and looked up.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPerhaps,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he suggested, \u00e2\u0080\u009cshe's seen enough of him to know beforehand\nthat there would be too much of him.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI never rightly understood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Hackett, \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust what it was about him,\nthere in the army--coming out a year beforehand, that way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI guess you never will,--from him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cap'n Jabez.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLaziness, I guess,--too much work,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Cap'n Billy. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat he\nwants is a wife with money. There ain't a better doctor anywhere.\nI've heard 't up to Boston, where he got his manifest, they thought\neverything of him. He's smart enough, but he's lazy, and he always was\nlazy, and harder'n a nut. He's a curious mixtur'. 'N' I guess he's been\non the lookout for somethin' of this kind ever sence he begun practising\namong the summer boarders. Guess he's had an eye out.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey say he's poplar among 'em,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed the storekeeper thoughtfully.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's been pooty p'tic'lar, or they have,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cap'n Jabez.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, most on 'em's merried women,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hackett urged. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's astonishin'\nhow they do come off and leave their husbands, the whole summer long.\nThey say they're all out o' health, though.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI wonder,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Cap'n Billy, \u00e2\u0080\u009cif them coaliers is goin' to make a\nsettled thing of haulin' inside before they signal a pilot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know one thing,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Cap'n Jabez, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat if any coalier signals\nme in the channel, I'll see her in hell first\u00e2\u0080\u009d He slipped his smooth,\nwarm knife into his pocket, and walked out of the store amid a general\nsilence.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe's consid'ble worked up, about them coaliers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said old Cap'n Billy.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don't know as I've heard Jabez swear before--not since he was mate of\nthe Gallatin. He used to swear then, consid'able.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThem coaliers is enough to make any one swear,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Cap'n George. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf\nit's any ways fair weather they won't take you outside, and they cut you\ndown from twenty-five dollars to two dollars if they take you inside.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOld Cap'n Billy did not answer before he had breathed awhile, and then,\nhaving tried his cigar and found it out, he scraped a match on his\ncoat-sleeve. He looked at the flame while it burned from blue to yellow.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I guess if anybody's been p'tic'lar, it's been him. There ain't\nany doubt but what he's got a takin' way with the women. They like him.\nHe's masterful, and he ain't a fool, and women most gen'ly like a man\nthat ain't a fool. I guess if he 's got his eye on the girl's prop'ty,\nshe'll have to come along. He'd begin by havin' his own way about her\nanswer; he'd hang on till she said Yes, if she did n't say it first-off;\nand he'd keep on as he'd begun. I guess if he wants her it's a match.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n And Cap'n Billy threw his own into the square box of tobacco-stained\nsawdust under the stove.\n\nMrs. Maynard fully shared the opinion which rocked Dr. Mulbridge's\ndefeat with a belief in his invincible will. When it became necessary,\nin the course of events which made Grace and Libby resolve upon a\nshort engagement, to tell her that they were going to be married, she\nexpressed a frank astonishment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWalter Libby!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she cried. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I\nam surprised. When I was talking to you the other day about getting\nmarried, of course I supposed it was going to be Dr. Mulbridge. I did\nn't want you to marry him, but I thought you were going to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd why,\u00e2\u0080\u009d demanded Grace, with mounting sensation, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdid you think\nthat?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I thought you would have to.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHave to?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, you have such a weak will. Or I always thought you had. But perhaps\nit's only a weak will with other women. I don't know! But Walter\nLibby! I knew he was perfectly gone upon you, and I told you so at the\nbeginning; but I never dreamt of your caring for him. Why, it seems too\nridiculous.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIndeed! I'm glad that it amuses you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh no, you're not, Grace. But you know what I mean. He seems so much\nyounger.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYounger? He's half a year older than I am.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI did n't say he was younger. But you're so very grave and he's so very\nlight. Well, I always told Walter Libby I should get him a wife, but you\nwere the last person I should have thought of. What's going to become\nof all your high purposes? You can't do anything with them when you're\nmarried! But you won't have any occasion for them, that's one comfort.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt's not my idea of marriage that any high purpose will be lost in it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, it is n't anybody's, before they get married. I had such high\npurposes I couldn't rest. I felt like hiring a hall, as George says,\nall the time. Walter Libby is n't going to let you practise, is he? You\nmustn't let him! I know he'd be willing to do anything you said, but a\nhusband ought to be something more than a mere & Co.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nGrace laughed at the impudent cynicism of all this, for she was too\nhappy to be vexed with any one just then. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm glad you've come to think\nso well of husbands' rights at last, Louise,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nMrs. Maynard took the little puncture in good part. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, yes, George\nand I have had a good deal of light let in on us. I don't suppose my\ncharacter was much changed outwardly in my sickness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she suggested.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was not,\u00e2\u0080\u009d answered Grace warmly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was intensified, that was all.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nMrs. Maynard laughed in her turn, with real enjoyment of the conception.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWell, I wasn't going to let on, unless it came to the worst; I did\nn't say much, but I kept up an awful thinking. It would have been easy\nenough to get a divorce, and George would n't have opposed it; but I\nlooked at it in this way: that the divorce wouldn't have put us back\nwhere we were, anyway, as I had supposed it would. We had broken into\neach other's lives, and we couldn't get out again, with all the divorces\nunder the sun. That's the worst of getting married: you break into each\nother's lives. You said something like it to me, that day when you came\nback from your sail with Walter Libby. And I just concluded that there\ncould n't be any trial that would n't be a great deal easier to bear\nthan getting rid of all your trials; and I just made up my mind that\nif any divorce was to be got, George Maynard might get it himself; a\ntemporary separation was bad enough for me, and I told him so, about the\nfirst words I could speak. And we're going to try the new departure\non that platform. We don't either of us suspect we can have things\nperfectly smooth, but we've agreed to rough it together when we can't.\nWe've found out that we can't marry and then become single, any more\nthan we could die and come to life again. And don't you forget it,\nGrace! You don't half know yourself, now. You know what you have been;\nbut getting married lets loose all your possibilities. You don't know\nwhat a temper you've got, nor how badly you can behave--how much like a\nnaughty, good-for-nothing little girl; for a husband and wife are just\ntwo children together: that's what makes the sweetness of it, and that's\nwhat makes the dreadfulness. Oh, you'll have need of all your good\nprinciples, I can tell you, and if you've a mind to do anything\npractical in the way of high purposes, I reckon there'll be use for them\nall.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAnother lady who was astonished at Grace's choice was more incurably\ndisappointed and more grieved for the waste of those noble aims with\nwhich her worshipping fancy had endowed the girl even more richly than\nher own ambition. It was Grace's wish to pass a year in Europe before\nher husband should settle down in charge of his mills; and their\nengagement, marriage, and departure followed so swiftly upon one\nanother, that Miss Gleason would have had no opportunity to proffer\nremonstrance or advice. She could only account for Grace's course on\nthe theory that Dr. Mulbridge had failed to offer himself; but this\nexplained her failure to marry him, without explaining her marriage\nwith Mr. Libby. That remained for some time a mystery, for Miss Gleason\nfirmly refused to believe that such a girl could be in love with a man\nso much her inferior: the conception disgraced not only her idol,\nbut cast shame upon all other women, whose course in such matters is\nnotoriously governed by motives of the highest sagacity and judgment.\n\nMrs. Breen hesitated between the duty of accompanying the young couple\non their European travels, and that of going to the village where\nLibby's mills were situated,--in southern New Hampshire. She was not\nstrongly urged to a decision by her children, and she finally chose the\nlatter course. The mill property had been a long time abandoned before\nLibby's father bought it, and put it in a repair which he did not hasten\nto extend to the village. This had remained in a sort of picturesque\nneglect, which harmonized with the scenery of the wild little valley\nwhere it nestled; and Mrs. Breen found, upon the vigorous inquiry\nwhich she set on foot, that the operatives were deplorably destitute of\nculture and drainage. She at once devoted herself to the establishment\nof a circulating library and an enlightened system of cess-pools, to\nsuch an effect of ingratitude in her beneficiaries that she was quite\nready to remand them to their former squalor when her son-in-law\nreturned. But he found her work all so good that he mediated between her\nand the inhabitants, and adopted it with a hearty appreciation that went\nfar to console her, and finally popularized it. In fact, he entered into\nthe spirit of all practical reforms with an energy and intelligence that\nquite reconciled her to him. It was rather with Grace than with him\nthat she had fault to find. She believed that the girl had returned from\nEurope materialized and corrupted; and she regarded the souvenirs of\ntravel with which the house was filled as so many tokens of moral decay.\nIt is undeniable that Grace seemed for a time, to have softened to, a\ncertain degree of self-indulgence. During the brief opera season the\nfirst winter after her return, she spent a week in Boston; she often\ncame to the city, and went to the theatres and the exhibitions of\npictures. It was for some time Miss Gleason's opinion that these\nescapades were the struggles of a magnanimous nature, unequally mated,\nto forget itself. When they met she indulged the habit of regarding Mrs.\nLibby with eyes of latent pity, till one day she heard something that\ngave her more relief than she could ever have hoped for. This was\nthe fact, perfectly ascertained by some summer sojourners in the\nneighborhood; that Mrs. Libby was turning her professional training to\naccount by treating the sick children among her husband's operatives.\n\nIn the fall Miss Gleason saw her heroine at an exhibition of\npictures. She rushed across the main hall of the Museum to greet her.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cCongratulate you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d she deeply whispered, \u00e2\u0080\u009con realizing your dream! Now\nyou are happy, now you can be at peace!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHappy? At peace?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn the good work you have taken up. Oh, nothing, under Gawd, is lost!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n she exclaimed, getting ready to run away, and speaking with her face\nturned over her shoulder towards Mrs. Libby.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cDream? Good work? What do you mean?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThose factory children!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh!\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mrs. Libby coldly, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthat was my husband's idea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYour husband's!\u00e2\u0080\u009d cried Miss Gleason, facing about again, and trying to\nlet a whole history of suddenly relieved anxiety speak in her eyes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow\nhappy you make me! Do let me thank you!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn the effort to shake hands with Mrs. Libby she knocked the catalogue\nout of her hold, and vanished in the crowd without knowing it. Some\ngentleman picked it up, and gave it to her again, with a bow of\nburlesque devotion.\n\nMrs. Libby flushed tenderly. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI might have known it would be you,\nWalter. Where did you spring from?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI've been here ever since you came.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat in the world doing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, enjoying myself.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cLooking at the pictures?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWatching you walk round:'\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI thought you couldn't be enjoying the pictures,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said simply. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI'm\nnot.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShe was not happy, indeed, in any of the aesthetic dissipations into\nwhich she had plunged, and it was doubtless from a shrewder knowledge\nof her nature than she had herself that her husband had proposed\nthis active usefulness, which she once intended under such different\nconditions. At the end of the ends she was a Puritan; belated, misdated,\nif the reader will, and cast upon good works for the consolation which\nthe Puritans formerly found in a creed. Riches and ease were sinful to\nher, and somehow to be atoned for; and she had no real love for anything\nthat was not of an immediate humane and spiritual effect. Under the\nshelter of her husband's name the benevolent use of her skill was no\nqueerer than the charity to which many ladies devote themselves; though\nthey are neither of them people to have felt the anguish which comes\nfrom the fear of what other people will think. They go their way in\nlife, and are probably not disturbed by any misgivings concerning them.\nIt is thought, on one hand, that he is a man of excellent head, and of\na heart so generous that his deference to her in certain matters is part\nof the devoted flattery which would spoil any other woman, but that she\nconsults his judgment in every action of her life, and trusts his sense\nwith the same completeness that she trusts his love. On the other hand,\nwhen it is felt that she ought to have done for the sake of woman what\nshe could not do for herself, she is regarded as sacrificed in her\nmarriage. If, it is feared, she is not infatuated with her husband, she\nis in a disgraceful subjection, without the hope of better or higher\nthings. If she had children, they might be a compensation and refuge\nfor her; in that case, to be sure, she must be cut off from her present\nresource in caring for the children of others; though the conditions\nunder which she now exercises her skill certainly amount to begging the\nwhole question of woman's fitness for the career she had chosen.\n\nBoth parties to this contention are, strange to say, ladies. If it has\nnot been made clear from the events and characters of the foregoing\nhistory which opinion is right, I am unable to decide. It is well,\nperhaps, not to be too explicitly in the confidence of one's heroine.\nAfter her marriage perhaps it is not even decorous.\n\n\n\nPG EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A boat's like your own fireside for snugness\n     All treat ourselves upon a theory\n     Character of all-compelling lady's-novel hero\n     Critical spirit of a recent arrival\n     Delusion that because I was very unhappy I was useful\n     Divination of her unexpressed desires\n     Evasion that she never used in behalf of others\n     Every woman physician has a double disadvantage\n     Feeble sense of humor often failed to seize his intention\n     Husband and wife are just two children together\n     Intention not to tell him something she wished to tell him\n     Kind, without being at any moment unprofitably sympathetic\n     Knew when to listen and when not to listen\n     Laugh, which had its edge of patronage and conceit\n     Long to be consoled and even flattered for having been silly\n     New England attractive three months of the year\n     Optimistic fatalism\n     Professional finality\n     Raising children is mighty uncertain business\n     Results at war with all the precepts\n     Robust inebriety\n     She likes to share her sufferings with her friends\n     Short cuts through the elaborate and reluctant statements\n     Success looks a good deal like failure from the inside\n     Talking vapidities\n     The rule is to disturb a doctor\n     Titter of self-applause\n     Tremble at the suggestion of a change for the better\n     Village seemed to get afloat at last\n     Vouchsafed an explanation to no one\n     Willing another woman should forgive her husband\n     You must n't believe too much in doctors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Dr. Breen's Practice, by William Dean Howells\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DR.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n","id":525,"split":"train"}
