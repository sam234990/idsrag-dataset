{"ori_id":"7f15a08cde92f095f5abfe937b07769c1eee28fe","title":"No Name (novel)","context":"No Name (novel)\n The story is told in eight major parts, called Scenes.\nScene One begins in 1846, at Combe-Raven in West Somerset, the country residence of the wealthy Vanstone family: Andrew Vanstone, his wife, and their two daughters. Norah, age 26, is happy and quiet; Magdalen, 18, is beautiful but volatile and willful. They live in peace and contentment, looked after by their governess, Miss Garth.\nThrough amateur theatricals, Magdalen discovers she is a talented actress and falls in love with Frank Clare, the idle but handsome son of a neighbour, who is also in the play. They want to be married, and their fathers agree. Although Frank fails at every career he reluctantly tries, and his father is not wealthy, Magdalen's fortune will easily support the young couple.\nBut before they marry, Mr. Vanstone is killed in a train crash and Mrs. Vanstone dies in childbirth. The girls discover from the lawyer, Mr. Pendril, that their parents have only been married for a few months, and their wedding invalidated the will which left everything to the daughters.\nSince the daughters are illegitimate, they have no name, no rights, and no property. Combe-Raven and the entire family fortune are inherited by Andrew's older brother, Michael Vanstone, who has been bitterly estranged from the family for many years. He refuses to provide any support for the orphaned young women. With the help only of their governess Miss Garth, they set out to make their own way in the world.\nScene Two is set in York, where Magdalen enlists the help of Captain Wragge, a distant relative of her mother's and a professional swindler. He helps get Magdalen started on the stage in return for a share of the proceeds. His wife Matilda, whom he married for an expected inheritance, is physically huge and kindly but mentally slow; she has to be supervised like a child.\nScene Three is in Vauxhall Walk, Lambeth. Magdalen, having earned some money, forsakes the stage and plots to get her inheritance back. Michael Vanstone has died; his only son Noel is sickly and looked after by his housekeeper, Virginie Lecount, a shrewd woman who hopes to inherit his money. Magdalen goes to Lambeth disguised as Miss Garth to see how the land lies, but Mrs. Lecount sees through her disguise and cuts a bit of cloth from the hem of her brown alpaca dress as a keepsake.\nScene Four is in Aldborough, Suffolk, where Magdalen tries to carry out her plot to regain her inheritance by marrying Noel Vanstone under an assumed name, with Captain and Mrs. Wragge posing as her uncle and aunt. Wragge and Lecount plot and attempt to outdo each other. In the end, Lecount is sent on a false errand to Zurich, and Magdalen and Noel are married. Captain Wragge arranges the marriage on condition that he will never have to see Magdalen again once it has happened.\nScene Five is in Baliol Cottage, Dumfries. Noel is alone, as his wife has left to visit her sister in London. Mrs. Lecount is back from Zurich and explains who his wife really is, with the help of the cut bit of cloth from the brown alpaca dress. Noel, at her direction, rewrites his will, cutting off his wife and leaving a legacy to Lecount and everything else to Admiral Bartram, his cousin. He encloses a secret letter, asking Admiral Bartram that the money be passed to young George Bartram, but only on the condition that he marry someone not a widow within six months, thus ensuring that Magdalen cannot marry George for the money. The strain of this scheming is too much for Noel, and he dies from a weak heart.\nScene Six is in St John's Wood where Magdalen has lodgings. Estranged from Norah and from Miss Garth, who she thinks betrayed her husband's whereabouts to Lecount, she hatches a plot to disguise herself as a maid and infiltrate into Admiral Bartram's house to look for the Secret Trust document. Her own maid Louisa helps to train her in return for Magdalen's giving her the money to marry her fiance, the father of her illegitimate child, and move to Australia.\nScene Seven is at St. Crux, the Bartram country house. Magdalen, working under Louisa's name as a parlour maid for Admiral Bartram, searches through the house for the Secret Trust. Eventually she manages it by following Admiral Bartram as he sleepwalks, but she is discovered and thrown out of the house.\nThe last scene is set in a poor lodging house, Aaron's Building. Magdalen is ill and destitute, about to be carried off to hospital or the workhouse, when a handsome man appears and rescues her. It is Captain Kirke, a sailor who had seen and become enamored of her at Aldborough. Meanwhile, Norah has married George Bartram, thus placing the inheritance back into the Vanstone family. Magdalen, in her illness and recovery, vows to be a better person and never again undertake any malice. Kirke and Magdalen profess their love for one another.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of No Name, by Wilkie Collins\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Here is\none more book that depicts the struggle of a human creature, under those\nopposing influences of Good and Evil, which we have all felt, which we\nhave all known. It has been my aim to make the character of \"Magdalen,\"\nwhich personifies this struggle, a pathetic character even in its\nperversity and its error; and I have tried hard to attain this result by\nthe least obtrusive and the least artificial of all means--by a resolute\nadherence throughout to the truth as it is in Nature. This design was\nno easy one to accomplish; and it has been a great encouragement to me\n(during the publication of my story in its periodical form) to know, on\nthe authority of many readers, that the object which I had proposed to\nmyself, I might, in some degree, consider as an object achieved.\n\nRound the central figure in the narrative other characters will be found\ngrouped, in sharp contrast--contrast, for the most part, in which I\nhave endeavored to make the element of humor mainly predominant. I have\nsought to impart this relief to the more serious passages in the book,\nnot only because I believe myself to be justified in doing so by the\nlaws of Art--but because experience has taught me (what the experience\nof my readers will doubtless confirm) that there is no such moral\nphenomenon as unmixed tragedy to be found in the world around us.\nLook where we may, the dark threads and the light cross each other\nperpetually in the texture of human life.\n\nTo pass from the Characters to the Story, it will be seen that the\nnarrative related in these pages has been constructed on a plan which\ndiffers from the plan followed in my last novel, and in some other of\nmy works published at an earlier date. The only Secret contained in this\nbook is revealed midway in the first volume. From that point, all the\nmain events of the story are purposely foreshadowed before they take\nplace--my present design being to rouse the reader's interest in\nfollowing the train of circumstances by which these foreseen events are\nbrought about. In trying this new ground, I am not turning my back in\ndoubt on the ground which I have passed over already. My one object in\nfollowing a new course is to enlarge the range of my studies in the art\nof writing fiction, and to vary the form in which I make my appeal to\nthe reader, as attractively as I can.\n\nThere is no need for me to add more to these few prefatory words than is\nhere written. What I might otherwise have wished to say in this place, I\nhave endeavored to make the book itself say for me.\n\n\nTO\n\nFRANCIS CARR BEARD\n\n\n(FELLOW OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND),\n\nIN REMEMBRANCE OF THE TIME WHEN\n\nTHE CLOSING SCENES OF THIS STORY WERE WRITTEN.\n\n\n\n\nNO NAME.\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIRST SCENE.\n\nCOMBE-RAVEN, SOMERSETSHIRE.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE hands on the hall-clock pointed to half-past six in the morning. The\nhouse was a country residence in West Somersetshire, called Combe-Raven.\nThe day was the fourth of March, and the year was eighteen hundred and\nforty-six.\n\nNo sounds but the steady ticking of the clock, and the lumpish snoring\nof a large dog stretched on a mat outside the dining-room door,\ndisturbed the mysterious morning stillness of hall and staircase. Who\nwere the sleepers hidden in the upper regions? Let the house reveal\nits own secrets; and, one by one, as they descend the stairs from their\nbeds, let the sleepers disclose themselves.\n\nAs the clock pointed to a quarter to seven, the dog woke and shook\nhimself. After waiting in vain for the footman, who was accustomed to\nlet him out, the animal wandered restlessly from one closed door\nto another on the ground-floor; and, returning to his mat in great\nperplexity, appealed to the sleeping family with a long and melancholy\nhowl.\n\nBefore the last notes of the dog's remonstrance had died away, the\noaken stairs in the higher regions of the house creaked under\nslowly-descending footsteps. In a minute more the first of the female\nservants made her appearance, with a dingy woolen shawl over her\nshoulders--for the March morning was bleak; and rheumatism and the cook\nwere old acquaintances.\n\nReceiving the dog's first cordial advances with the worst possible\ngrace, the cook slowly opened the hall door and let the animal out. It\nwas a wild morning. Over a spacious lawn, and behind a black plantation\nof firs, the rising sun rent its way upward through piles of ragged\ngray cloud; heavy drops of rain fell few and far between; the March\nwind shuddered round the corners of the house, and the wet trees swayed\nwearily.\n\nSeven o'clock struck; and the signs of domestic life began to show\nthemselves in more rapid succession.\n\nThe housemaid came down--tall and slim, with the state of the spring\ntemperature written redly on her nose. The lady's-maid followed--young,\nsmart, plump, and sleepy. The kitchen-maid came next--afflicted with\nthe face-ache, and making no secret of her sufferings. Last of all, the\nfootman appeared, yawning disconsolately; the living picture of a man\nwho felt that he had been defrauded of his fair night's rest.\n\nThe conversation of the servants, when they assembled before the slowly\nlighting kitchen fire, referred to a recent family event, and turned at\nstarting on this question: Had Thomas, the footman, seen anything of\nthe concert at Clifton, at which his master and the two young ladies had\nbeen present on the previous night? Yes; Thomas had heard the concert;\nhe had been paid for to go in at the back; it was a loud concert; it\nwas a hot concert; it was described at the top of the bills as Grand;\nwhether it was worth traveling sixteen miles to hear by railway,\nwith the additional hardship of going back nineteen miles by road, at\nhalf-past one in the morning--was a question which he would leave his\nmaster and the young ladies to decide; his own opinion, in the meantime,\nbeing unhesitatingly, No. Further inquiries, on the part of all the\nfemale servants in succession, elicited no additional information of any\nsort. Thomas could hum none of the songs, and could describe none of the\nladies' dresses. His audience, accordingly, gave him up in despair; and\nthe kitchen small-talk flowed back into its ordinary channels, until the\nclock struck eight and startled the assembled servants into separating\nfor their morning's work.\n\nA quarter past eight, and nothing happened. Half-past--and more signs\nof life appeared from the bedroom regions. The next member of the family\nwho came downstairs was Mr. Andrew Vanstone, the master of the house.\n\nTall, stout, and upright--with bright blue eyes, and healthy, florid\ncomplexion--his brown plush shooting-jacket carelessly buttoned awry;\nhis vixenish little Scotch terrier barking unrebuked at his heels;\none hand thrust into his waistcoat pocket, and the other smacking the\nbanisters cheerfully as he came downstairs humming a tune--Mr. Vanstone\nshowed his character on the surface of him freely to all men. An easy,\nhearty, handsome, good-humored gentleman, who walked on the sunny side\nof the way of life, and who asked nothing better than to meet all his\nfellow-passengers in this world on the sunny side, too. Estimating\nhim by years, he had turned fifty. Judging him by lightness of heart,\nstrength of constitution, and capacity for enjoyment, he was no older\nthan most men who have only turned thirty.\n\n\"Thomas!\" cried Mr. Vanstone, taking up his old felt hat and his thick\nwalking stick from the hall table. \"Breakfast, this morning, at ten. The\nyoung ladies are not likely to be down earlier after the concert last\nnight.--By-the-by, how did you like the concert yourself, eh? You\nthought it was grand? Quite right; so it was. Nothing but crash-ban g,\nvaried now and then by bang-crash; all the women dressed within an\ninch of their lives; smothering heat, blazing gas, and no room for\nanybody--yes, yes, Thomas; grand's the word for it, and comfortable\nisn't.\" With that expression of opinion, Mr. Vanstone whistled to his\nvixenish terrier; flourished his stick at the hall door in cheerful\ndefiance of the rain; and set off through wind and weather for his\nmorning walk.\n\nThe hands, stealing their steady way round the dial of the clock,\npointed to ten minutes to nine. Another member of the family appeared on\nthe stairs--Miss Garth, the governess.\n\nNo observant eyes could have surveyed Miss Garth without seeing at once\nthat she was a north-countrywoman. Her hard featured face; her masculine\nreadiness and decision of movement; her obstinate honesty of look and\nmanner, all proclaimed her border birth and border training. Though\nlittle more than forty years of age, her hair was quite gray; and she\nwore over it the plain cap of an old woman. Neither hair nor head-dress\nwas out of harmony with her face--it looked older than her years: the\nhard handwriting of trouble had scored it heavily at some past time.\nThe self-possession of her progress downstairs, and the air of habitual\nauthority with which she looked about her, spoke well for her position\nin Mr. Vanstone's family. This was evidently not one of the forlorn,\npersecuted, pitiably dependent order of governesses. Here was a woman\nwho lived on ascertained and honorable terms with her employers--a woman\nwho looked capable of sending any parents in England to the right-about,\nif they failed to rate her at her proper value.\n\n\"Breakfast at ten?\" repeated Miss Garth, when the footman had answered\nthe bell, and had mentioned his master's orders. \"Ha! I thought what\nwould come of that concert last night. When people who live in the\ncountry patronize public amusements, public amusements return the\ncompliment by upsetting the family afterward for days together. _You're_\nupset, Thomas, I can see your eyes are as red as a ferret's, and your\ncravat looks as if you had slept in it. Bring the kettle at a quarter to\nten--and if you don't get better in the course of the day, come to me,\nand I'll give you a dose of physic. That's a well-meaning lad, if you\nonly let him alone,\" continued Miss Garth, in soliloquy, when Thomas had\nretired; \"but he's not strong enough for concerts twenty miles off. They\nwanted _me_ to go with them last night. Yes: catch me!\"\n\nNine o'clock struck; and the minute-hand stole on to twenty minutes past\nthe hour, before any more footsteps were heard on the stairs. At the\nend of that time, two ladies appeared, descending to the breakfast-room\ntogether--Mrs. Vanstone and her eldest daughter.\n\nIf the personal attractions of Mrs. Vanstone, at an earlier period of\nlife, had depended solely on her native English charms of complexion and\nfreshness, she must have long since lost the last relics of her fairer\nself. But her beauty as a young woman had passed beyond the average\nnational limits; and she still preserved the advantage of her more\nexceptional personal gifts. Although she was now in her forty-fourth\nyear; although she had been tried, in bygone times, by the premature\nloss of more than one of her children, and by long attacks of illness\nwhich had followed those bereavements of former years--she still\npreserved the fair proportion and subtle delicacy of feature, once\nassociated with the all-adorning brightness and freshness of beauty,\nwhich had left her never to return. Her eldest child, now descending the\nstairs by her side, was the mirror in which she could look back and\nsee again the reflection of her own youth. There, folded thick on the\ndaughter's head, lay the massive dark hair, which, on the mother's, was\nfast turning gray. There, in the daughter's cheek, glowed the lovely\ndusky red which had faded from the mother's to bloom again no more. Miss\nVanstone had already reached the first maturity of womanhood; she had\ncompleted her six-and-twentieth year. Inheriting the dark majestic\ncharacter of her mother's beauty, she had yet hardly inherited all its\ncharms. Though the shape of her face was the same, the features were\nscarcely so delicate, their proportion was scarcely so true. She was not\nso tall. She had the dark-brown eyes of her mother--full and soft, with\nthe steady luster in them which Mrs. Vanstone's eyes had lost--and yet\nthere was less interest, less refinement and depth of feeling in her\nexpression: it was gentle and feminine, but clouded by a certain quiet\nreserve, from which her mother's face was free. If we dare to look\nclosely enough, may we not observe that the moral force of character\nand the higher intellectual capacities in parents seem often to wear out\nmysteriously in the course of transmission to children? In these days of\ninsidious nervous exhaustion and subtly-spreading nervous malady, is\nit not possible that the same rule may apply, less rarely than we are\nwilling to admit, to the bodily gifts as well?\n\nThe mother and daughter slowly descended the stairs together--the first\ndressed in dark brown, with an Indian shawl thrown over her shoulders;\nthe second more simply attired in black, with a plain collar and cuffs,\nand a dark orange-colored ribbon over the bosom of her dress. As they\ncrossed the hall and entered the breakfast-room, Miss Vanstone was full\nof the all-absorbing subject of the last night's concert.\n\n\"I am so sorry, mamma, you were not with us,\" she said. \"You have been\nso strong and so well ever since last summer--you have felt so many\nyears younger, as you said yourself--that I am sure the exertion would\nnot have been too much for you.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not, my love--but it was as well to keep on the safe side.\"\n\n\"Quite as well,\" remarked Miss Garth, appearing at the breakfast-room\ndoor. \"Look at Norah (good-morning, my dear)--look, I say, at Norah.\nA perfect wreck; a living proof of your wisdom and mine in staying at\nhome. The vile gas, the foul air, the late hours--what can you expect?\nShe's not made of iron, and she suffers accordingly. No, my dear, you\nneedn't deny it. I see you've got a headache.\"\n\nNorah's dark, handsome face brightened into a smile--then lightly\nclouded again with its accustomed quiet reserve.\n\n\"A very little headache; not half enough to make me regret the concert,\"\nshe said, and walked away by herself to the window.\n\nOn the far side of a garden and paddock the view overlooked a stream,\nsome farm buildings which lay beyond, and the opening of a wooded,\nrocky pass (called, in Somersetshire, a Combe), which here cleft its way\nthrough the hills that closed the prospect. A winding strip of road was\nvisible, at no great distance, amid the undulations of the open ground;\nand along this strip the stalwart figure of Mr. Vanstone was now\neasily recognizable, returning to the house from his morning walk. He\nflourished his stick gayly, as he observed his eldest daughter at the\nwindow. She nodded and waved her hand in return, very gracefully and\nprettily--but with something of old-fashioned formality in her manner,\nwhich looked strangely in so young a woman, and which seemed out of\nharmony with a salutation addressed to her father.\n\nThe hall-clock struck the adjourned breakfast-hour. When the minute hand\nhad recorded the lapse of five minutes more a door banged in the bedroom\nregions--a clear young voice was heard singing blithely--light, rapid\nfootsteps pattered on the upper stairs, descended with a jump to the\nlanding, and pattered again, faster than ever, down the lower flight.\nIn another moment the youngest of Mr. Vanstone's two daughters (and two\nonly surviving children) dashed into view on the dingy old oaken stairs,\nwith the suddenness of a flash of light; and clearing the last three\nsteps into the hall at a jump, presented herself breathless in the\nbreakfast-room to make the family circle complete.\n\n\nBy one of those strange caprices of Nature, which science leaves still\nunexplained, the youngest of Mr. Vanstone's children presented no\nrecognizable resemblance to either of her parents. How had she come by\nher hair? how had she come by her eyes? Even her father and mother had\nasked themselves those questions, as she grew up to girlhood, and\nhad been sorely perplexed to answer them. Her hair was of that purely\nlight-brown hue, unmixed with flaxen, or yellow, or red--which is\noftener seen on the plumage of a bird than on the head of a human being.\nIt was soft and plentiful, and waved downward from her low forehead\nin regular folds--but, to some tastes, it was dull and dead, in its\nabsolute want of glossiness, in its monotonous purity of plain light\ncolor. Her eyebrows and eyelashes were just a shade darker than her\nhair, and seemed made expressly for those violet-blue eyes, which assert\ntheir most irresistible charm when associated with a fair complexion.\nBut it was here exactly that the promise of her face failed of\nperformance in the most startling manner. The eyes, which should have\nbeen dark, were incomprehensibly and discordantly light; they were of\nthat nearly colorless gray which, though little attractive in itself,\npossesses the rare compensating merit of interpreting the finest\ngradations of thought, the gentlest changes of feeling, the deepest\ntrouble of passion, with a subtle transparency of expression which no\ndarker eyes can rival. Thus quaintly self-contradictory in the upper\npart of her face, she was hardly less at variance with established ideas\nof harmony in the lower. Her lips had the true feminine delicacy of\nform, her cheeks the lovely roundness and smoothness of youth--but the\nmouth was too large and firm, the chin too square and massive for her\nsex and age. Her complexion partook of the pure monotony of tint which\ncharacterized her hair--it was of the same soft, warm, creamy fairness\nall over, without a tinge of color in the cheeks, except on occasions\nof unusual bodily exertion or sudden mental disturbance. The whole\ncountenance--so remarkable in its strongly opposed characteristics--was\nrendered additionally striking by its extraordinary mobility. The large,\nelectric, light-gray eyes were hardly ever in repose; all varieties of\nexpression followed each other over the plastic, ever-changing face,\nwith a giddy rapidity which left sober analysis far behind in the race.\nThe girl's exuberant vitality asserted itself all over her, from head to\nfoot. Her figure--taller than her sister's, taller than the average of\nwoman's height; instinct with such a seductive, serpentine suppleness,\nso lightly and playfully graceful, that its movements suggested, not\nunnaturally, the movements of a young cat--her figure was so perfectly\ndeveloped already that no one who saw her could have supposed that she\nwas only eighteen. She bloomed in the full physical maturity of twenty\nyears or more--bloomed naturally and irresistibly, in right of her\nmatchless health and strength. Here, in truth, lay the mainspring of\nthis strangely-constituted organization. Her headlong course down the\nhouse stairs; the brisk activity of all her movements; the incessant\nsparkle of expression in her face; the enticing gayety which took the\nhearts of the quietest people by storm--even the reckless delight in\nbright colors which showed itself in her brilliantly-striped morning\ndress, in her fluttering ribbons, in the large scarlet rosettes on her\nsmart little shoes--all sprang alike from the same source; from the\noverflowing physical health which strengthened every muscle, braced\nevery nerve, and set the warm young blood tingling through her veins,\nlike the blood of a growing child.\n\n\nOn her entry into the breakfast-room, she was saluted with the customary\nremonstrance which her flighty disregard of all punctuality habitually\nprovoked from the long-suffering household authorities. In Miss Garth's\nfavorite phrase, \"Magdalen was born with all the senses--except a sense\nof order.\"\n\nMagdalen! It was a strange name to have given her? Strange, indeed;\nand yet, chosen under no extraordinary circumstances. The name had been\nborne by one of Mr. Vanstone's sisters, who had died in early youth;\nand, in affectionate remembrance of her, he had called his second\ndaughter by it--just as he had called his eldest daughter Norah, for his\nwife's sake. Magdalen! Surely, the grand old Bible name--suggestive of\na sad and somber dignity; recalling, in its first association, mournful\nideas of penitence and seclusion--had been here, as events had turned\nout, inappropriately bestowed? Surely, this self-contradictory girl had\nperversely accomplished one contradiction more, by developing into a\ncharacter which was out of all harmony with her own Christian name!\n\n\"Late again!\" said Mrs. Vanstone, as Magdalen breathlessly kissed her.\n\n\"Late again!\" chimed in Miss Garth, when Magdalen came her way next.\n\"Well?\" she went on, taking the girl's chin familiarly in her hand, with\na half-satirical, half-fond attention which betrayed that the youngest\ndaughter, with all her faults, was the governess's favorite--\"Well?\nand what has the concert done for _you?_ What form of suffering has\ndissipation inflicted on _your_ system this morning?\"\n\n\"Suffering!\" repeated Magdalen, recovering her breath, and the use of\nher tongue with it. \"I don't know the meaning of the word: if there's\nanything the matter with me, I'm too well. Suffering! I'm ready for\nanother concert to-night, and a ball to-morrow, and a play the day\nafter. Oh,\" cried Magdalen, dropping into a chair and crossing her hands\nrapturously on the table, \"how I do like pleasure!\"\n\n\"Come! that's explicit at any rate,\" said Miss Garth. \"I think Pope must\nhave had you in his mind when he wrote his famous lines:\n\n\"'Men some to business, some to pleasure take, But every woman is at\nheart a rake.'\"\n\n\"The deuce she is!\" cried Mr. Vanstone, entering the room while Miss\nGarth was making her quotation, with the dogs at his heels. \"Well;\nlive and learn. If you're all rakes, Miss Garth, the sexes are turned\ntopsy-turvy with a vengeance; and the men will have nothing left for\nit but to stop at home and darn the stockings.--Let's have some\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\"How-d'ye-do, papa?\" said Magdalen, taking Mr. Vanstone as boisterously\nround the neck as if he belonged to some larger order of Newfoundland\ndog, and was made to be romped with at his daughter's convenience. \"I'm\nthe rake Miss Garth means; and I want to go to another concert--or a\nplay, if you like--or a ball, if you prefer it--or anything else in the\nway of amusement that puts me into a new dress, and plunges me into a\ncrowd of people, and illuminates me with plenty of light, and sets me in\na tingle of excitement all over, from head to foot. Anything will do, as\nlong as it doesn't send us to bed at eleven o'clock.\"\n\nMr. Vanstone sat down composedly under his daughter's flow of language,\nlike a man who was well used to verbal inundation from that quarter. \"If\nI am to be allowed my choice of amusements next time,\" said the worthy\ngentleman, \"I think a play will suit me better than a concert. The girls\nenjoyed themselves amazingly, my dear,\" he continued, addressing his\nwife. \"More than I did, I must say. It was altogether above my mark.\nThey played one piece of music which lasted forty minutes. It stopped\nthree times, by-the-way; and we all thought it was done each time, and\nclapped our hands, rejoiced to be rid of it. But on it went again, to\nour great surprise and mortification, till we gave it up in despair, and\nall wished ourselves at Jericho. Norah, my dear! when we had crash-bang\nfor forty minutes, with three stoppages by-the-way, what did they call\nit?\"\n\n\"A symphony, papa,\" replied Norah.\n\n\"Yes, you darling old Goth, a symphony by the great Beethoven!\" added\nMagdalen. \"How can you say you were not amused? Have you forgotten the\nyellow-looking foreign woman, with the unpronounceable name? Don't you\nremember the faces she made when she sang? and the way she courtesied\nand courtesied, till she cheated the foolish people into crying encore?\nLook here, mamma--look here, Miss Garth!\"\n\nShe snatched up an empty plate from the table, to represent a sheet of\nmusic, held it before her in the established concert-room position,\nand produced an imitation of the unfortunate singer's grimaces and\ncourtesyings, so accurately and quaintly true to the original, that\nher father roared with laughter; and even the footman (who came in\nat that moment with the post-bag) rushed out of the room again, and\ncommitted the indecorum of echoing his master audibly on the other side\nof the door.\n\n\"Letters, papa. I want the key,\" said Magdalen, passing from the\nimitation at the breakfast-table to the post-bag on the sideboard with\nthe easy abruptness which characterized all her actions.\n\nMr. Vanstone searched his pockets and shook his head. Though his\nyoungest daughter might resemble him in nothing else, it was easy to see\nwhere Magdalen's unmethodical habits came from.\n\n\"I dare say I have left it in the library, along with my other keys,\"\nsaid Mr. Vanstone. \"Go and look for it, my dear.\"\n\n\"You really should check Magdalen,\" pleaded Mrs. Vanstone, addressing\nher husband when her daughter had left the room. \"Those habits of\nmimicry are growing on her; and she speaks to you with a levity which it\nis positively shocking to hear.\"\n\n\"Exactly what I have said myself, till I am tired of repeating it,\"\nremarked Miss Garth. \"She treats Mr. Vanstone as if he was a kind of\nyounger brother of hers.\"\n\n\"You are kind to us in everything else, papa; and you make kind\nallowances for Magdalen's high spirits--don't you?\" said the quiet\nNorah, taking her father's part and her sister's with so little show\nof resolution on the surface that few observers would have been sharp\nenough to detect the genuine substance beneath it.\n\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" said good-natured Mr. Vanstone. \"Thank you for a\nvery pretty speech. As for Magdalen,\" he continued, addressing his wife\nand Miss Garth, \"she's an unbroken filly. Let her caper and kick in the\npaddock to her heart's content. Time enough to break her to harness when\nshe gets a little older.\"\n\nThe door opened, and Magdalen returned with the key. She unlocked the\npost-bag at the sideboard and poured out the letters in a heap. Sorting\nthem gayly in less than a minute, she approached the breakfast-table\nwith both hands full, and delivered the letters all round with the\nbusiness-like rapidity of a London postman.\n\n\"Two for Norah,\" she announced, beginning with her sister. \"Three for\nMiss Garth. None for mamma. One for me. And the other six all for papa.\nYou lazy old darling, you hate answering letters, don't you?\" pursued\nMagdalen, dropping the postman's character and assuming the daughter's.\n\"How you will grumble and fidget in the study! and how you will wish\nthere were no such things as letters in the world! and how red your nice\nold bald head will get at the top with the worry of writing the answers;\nand how many of the answers you will leave until tomorrow after all!\n_The Bristol Theater's open, papa,_\" she whispered, slyly and suddenly,\nin her father's ear; \"I saw it in the newspaper when I went to the\nlibrary to get the key. Let's go to-morrow night!\"\n\nWhile his daughter was chattering, Mr. Vanstone was mechanically sorting\nhis letters. He turned over the first four in succession and looked\ncarelessly at the addresses. When he came to the fifth his attention,\nwhich had hitherto wandered toward Magdalen, suddenly became fixed on\nthe post-mark of the letter.\n\nStooping over him, with her head on his shoulder, Magdalen could see the\npost-mark as plainly as her father saw it--NEW ORLEANS.\n\n\"An American letter, papa!\" she said. \"Who do you know at New Orleans?\"\n\nMrs. Vanstone started, and looked eagerly at her husband the moment\nMagdalen spoke those words.\n\nMr. Vanstone said nothing. He quietly removed his daughter's arm\nfrom his neck, as if he wished to be free from all interruption. She\nreturned, accordingly, to her place at the breakfast-table. Her father,\nwith the letter in his hand, waited a little before he opened it; her\nmother looking at him, the while, with an eager, expectant attention\nwhich attracted Miss Garth's notice, and Norah's, as well as Magdalen's.\n\nAfter a minute or more of hesitation Mr. Vanstone opened the letter.\n\nHis face changed color the instant he read the first lines; his cheeks\nfading to a dull, yellow-brown hue, which would have been ashy\npaleness in a less florid man; and his expression becoming saddened and\noverclouded in a moment. Norah and Magdalen, watching anxiously, saw\nnothing but the change that passed over their father. Miss Garth alone\nobserved the effect which that change produced on the attentive mistress\nof the house.\n\nIt was not the effect which she, or any one, could have anticipated.\nMrs. Vanstone looked excited rather than alarmed. A faint flush rose on\nher cheeks--her eyes brightened--she stirred the tea round and round in\nher cup in a restless, impatient manner which was not natural to her.\n\nMagdalen, in her capacity of spoiled child, was, as usual, the first to\nbreak the silence.\n\n\"What _is_ the matter, papa?\" she asked.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said Mr. Vanstone, sharply, without looking up at her.\n\n\"I'm sure there must be something,\" persisted Magdalen. \"I'm sure there\nis bad news, papa, in that American letter.\"\n\n\"There is nothing in the letter that concerns _you_,\" said Mr. Vanstone.\n\nIt was the first direct rebuff that Magdalen had ever received from her\nfather. She looked at him with an incredulous surprise, which would have\nbeen irresistibly absurd under less serious circumstances.\n\nNothing more was said. For the first time, perhaps, in their lives, the\nfamily sat round the breakfast-table in painful silence. Mr. Vanstone's\nhearty morning appetite, like his hearty morning spirits, was gone. He\nabsently broke off some morsels of dry toast from the rack near him,\nabsently finished his first cup of tea--then asked for a second, which\nhe left before him untouched.\n\n\"Norah,\" he said, after an interval, \"you needn't wait for me. Magdalen,\nmy dear, you can go when you like.\"\n\nHis daughters rose immediately; and Miss Garth considerately followed\ntheir example. When an easy-tempered man does assert himself in his\nfamily, the rarity of the demonstration invariably has its effect; and\nthe will of that easy-tempered man is Law.\n\n\"What can have happened?\" whispered Norah, as they closed the\nbreakfast-room door and crossed the hall.\n\n\"What does papa mean by being cross with Me?\" exclaimed Magdalen,\nchafing under a sense of her own injuries.\n\n\"May I ask--what right you had to pry into your father's private\naffairs?\" retorted Miss Garth.\n\n\"Right?\" repeated Magdalen. \"I have no secrets from papa--what business\nhas papa to have secrets from me! I consider myself insulted.\"\n\n\"If you considered yourself properly reproved for not minding your own\nbusiness,\" said the plain-spoken Miss Garth, \"you would be a trifle\nnearer the truth. Ah! you are like all the rest of the girls in the\npresent day. Not one in a hundred of you knows which end of her's\nuppermost.\"\n\nThe three ladies entered the morning-room; and Magdalen acknowledged\nMiss Garth's reproof by banging the door.\n\nHalf an hour passed, and neither Mr. Vanstone nor his wife left the\nbreakfast-room. The servant, ignorant of what had happened, went in to\nclear the table--found his master and mistress seated close together in\ndeep consultation--and immediately went out again. Another quarter of an\nhour elapsed before the breakfast-room door was opened, and the private\nconference of the husband and wife came to an end.\n\n\"I hear mamma in the hall,\" said Norah. \"Perhaps she is coming to tell\nus something.\"\n\nMrs. Vanstone entered the morning-room as her daughter spoke. The\ncolor was deeper on her cheeks, and the brightness of half-dried tears\nglistened in her eyes; her step was more hasty, all her movements were\nquicker than usual.\n\n\"I bring news, my dears, which will surprise you,\" she said, addressing\nher daughters. \"Your father and I are going to London to-morrow.\"\n\nMagdalen caught her mother by the arm in speechless astonishment. Miss\nGarth dropped her work on her lap; even the sedate Norah started to her\nfeet, and amazedly repeated the words, \"Going to London!\"\n\n\"Without us?\" added Magdalen.\n\n\"Your father and I are going alone,\" said Mrs. Vanstone. \"Perhaps,\nfor as long as three weeks--but not longer. We are going\"--she\nhesitated--\"we are going on important family business. Don't hold\nme, Magdalen. This is a sudden necessity--I have a great deal to do\nto-day--many things to set in order before tomorrow. There, there, my\nlove, let me go.\"\n\nShe drew her arm away; hastily kissed her youngest daughter on the\nforehead; and at once left the room again. Even Magdalen saw that\nher mother was not to be coaxed into hearing or answering any more\nquestions.\n\nThe morning wore on, and nothing was seen of Mr. Vanstone. With the\nreckless curiosity of her age and character, Magdalen, in defiance of\nMiss Garth's prohibition and her sister's remonstrances, determined to\ngo to the study and look for her father there. When she tried the door,\nit was locked on the inside. She said, \"It's only me, papa;\" and waited\nfor the answer. \"I'm busy now, my dear,\" was the answer. \"Don't disturb\nme.\"\n\nMrs. Vanstone was, in another way, equally inaccessible. She remained\nin her own room, with the female servants about her, immersed in endless\npreparations for the approaching departure. The servants, little used\nin that family to sudden resolutions and unexpected orders, were\nawkward and confused in obeying directions. They ran from room to room\nunnecessarily, and lost time and patience in jostling each other on\nthe stairs. If a stranger had entered the house that day, he might have\nimagined that an unexpected disaster had happened in it, instead of an\nunexpected necessity for a journey to London. Nothing proceeded in its\nordinary routine. Magdalen, who was accustomed to pass the morning at\nthe piano, wandered restlessly about the staircases and passages, and in\nand out of doors when there were glimpses of fine weather. Norah, whose\nfondness for reading had passed into a family proverb, took up book\nafter book from table and shelf, and laid them down again, in despair of\nfixing her attention. Even Miss Garth felt the all-pervading influence\nof the household disorganization, and sat alone by the morning-room\nfire, with her head shaking ominously, and her work laid aside.\n\n\"Family affairs?\" thought Miss Garth, pondering over Mrs. Vanstone's\nvague explanatory words. \"I have lived twelve years at Combe-Raven; and\nthese are the first family affairs which have got between the parents\nand the children, in all my experience. What does it mean? Change? I\nsuppose I'm getting old. I don't like change.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAT ten o'clock the next morning Norah and Magdalen stood alone in the\nhall at Combe-Raven watching the departure of the carriage which took\ntheir father and mother to the London train.\n\nUp to the last moment, both the sisters had hoped for some explanation\nof that mysterious \"family business\" to which Mrs. Vanstone had so\nbriefly alluded on the previous day. No such explanation had been\noffered. Even the agitation of the leave-taking, under circumstances\nentirely new in the home experience of the parents and children, had\nnot shaken the resolute discretion of Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone. They had\ngone--with the warmest testimonies of affection, with farewell embraces\nfervently reiterated again and again--but without dropping one word,\nfrom first to last, of the nature of their errand.\n\nAs the grating sound of the carriage-wheels ceased suddenly at a turn in\nthe road, the sisters looked one another in the face; each feeling,\nand each betraying in her own way, the dreary sense that she was openly\nexcluded, for the first time, from the confidence of her parents.\nNorah's customary reserve strengthened into sullen silence--she sat down\nin one of the hall chairs and looked out frowningly through the open\nhouse door. Magdalen, as usual when her temper was ruffled, expressed\nher dissatisfaction in the plainest terms. \"I don't care who knows it--I\nthink we are both of us shamefully ill-used!\" With those words, the\nyoung lady followed her sister's example by seating herself on a hall\nchair and looking aimlessly out through the open house door.\n\nAlmost at the same moment Miss Garth entered the hall from the\nmorning-room. Her quick observation showed her the necessity for\ninterfering to some practical purpose; and her ready good sense at once\npointed the way.\n\n\"Look up, both of you, if you please, and listen to me,\" said Miss\nGarth. \"If we are all three to be comfortable and happy together, now\nwe are alone, we must stick to our usual habits and go on in our\nregular way. There is the state of things in plain words. Accept the\nsituation--as the French say. Here am I to set you the example. I have\njust ordered an excellent dinner at the customary hour. I am going to\nthe medicine-chest next, to physic the kitchen-maid--an unwholesome\ngirl, whose face-ache is all stomach. In the meantime, Norah, my dear,\nyou will find your work and your books, as usual, in the library.\nMagdalen, suppose you leave off tying your handkerchief into knots and\nuse your fingers on the keys of the piano instead? We'll lunch at one,\nand take the dogs out afterward. Be as brisk and cheerful both of you as\nI am. Come, rouse up directly. If I see those gloomy faces any longer,\nas sure as my name's Garth, I'll give your mother written warning and go\nback to my friends by the mixed train at twelve forty.\"\n\nConcluding her address of expostulation in those terms, Miss Garth led\nNorah to the library door, pushed Magdalen into the morning-room, and\nwent on her own way sternly to the regions of the medicine-chest.\n\nIn this half-jesting, half-earnest manner she was accustomed to maintain\na sort of friendly authority over Mr. Vanstone's daughters, after her\nproper functions as governess had necessarily come to an end. Norah, it\nis needless to say, had long since ceased to be her pupil; and Magdalen\nhad, by this time, completed her education. But Miss Garth had lived too\nlong and too intimately under Mr. Vanstone's roof to be parted with for\nany purely formal considerations; and the first hint at going away which\nshe had thought it her duty to drop was dismissed with such affectionate\nwarmth of protest that she never repeated it again, except in jest. The\nentire management of the household was, from that time forth, left in\nher hands; and to those duties she was free to add what companionable\nassistance she could render to Norah's reading, and what friendly\nsuperintendence she could still exercise over Magdalen's music. Such\nwere the terms on which Miss Garth was now a resident in Mr. Vanstone's\nfamily.\n\nToward the afternoon the weather improved. At half-past one the sun\nwas shining brightly; and the ladies left the house, accompanied by the\ndogs, to set forth on their walk.\n\nThey crossed the stream, and ascended by the little rocky pass to the\nhills beyond; then diverged to the left, and returned by a cross-road\nwhich led through the village of Combe-Raven.\n\nAs they came in sight of the first cottages, they passed a man, hanging\nabout the road, who looked attentively, first at Magdalen, then at\nNorah. They merely observed that he was short, that he was dressed in\nblack, and that he was a total stranger to them--and continued their\nhomeward walk, without thinking more about the loitering foot-passenger\nwhom they had met on their way back.\n\nAfter they had left the village, and had entered the road which led\nstraight to the house, Magdalen surprised Miss Garth by announcing that\nthe stranger in black had turned, after they had passed him, and was\nnow following them. \"He keeps on Norah's side of the road,\" she said,\nmischievously. \"I'm not the attraction--don't blame _me_.\"\n\nWhether the man was really following them, or not, made little\ndifference, for they were now close to the house. As they passed through\nthe lodge-gates, Miss Garth looked round, and saw that the stranger\nwas quickening his pace, apparently with the purpose of entering into\nconversation. Seeing this, she at once directed the young ladies to go\non to the house with the dogs, while she herself waited for events at\nthe gate.\n\nThere was just time to complete this discreet arrangement, before the\nstranger reached the lodge. He took off his hat to Miss Garth politely,\nas she turned round. What did he look like, on the face of him? He\nlooked like a clergyman in difficulties.\n\nTaking his portrait, from top to toe, the picture of him began with a\ntall hat, broadly encircled by a mourning band of crumpled crape. Below\nthe hat was a lean, long, sallow face, deeply pitted with the smallpox,\nand characterized, very remarkably, by eyes of two different colors--one\nbilious green, one bilious brown, both sharply intelligent. His hair was\niron-gray, carefully brushed round at the temples. His cheeks and chin\nwere in the bluest bloom of smooth shaving; his nose was short Roman;\nhis lips long, thin, and supple, curled up at the corners with a\nmildly-humorous smile. His white cravat was high, stiff, and dingy;\nthe collar, higher, stiffer, and dingier, projected its rigid points on\neither side beyond his chin. Lower down, the lithe little figure of the\nman was arrayed throughout in sober-shabby black. His frock-coat was\nbuttoned tight round the waist, and left to bulge open majestically at\nthe chest. His hands were covered with black cotton gloves neatly\ndarned at the fingers; his umbrella, worn down at the ferule to the last\nquarter of an inch, was carefully preserved, nevertheless, in an oilskin\ncase. The front view of him was the view in which he looked oldest;\nmeeting him face to face, he might have been estimated at fifty or more.\nWalking behind him, his back and shoulders were almost young enough to\nhave passed for five-and-thirty. His manners were distinguished by a\ngrave serenity. When he opened his lips, he spoke in a rich bass\nvoice, with an easy flow of language, and a strict attention to the\nelocutionary claims of words in more than one syllable. Persuasion\ndistilled from his mildly-curling lips; and, shabby as he was, perennial\nflowers of courtesy bloomed all over him from head to foot.\n\n\"This is the residence of Mr. Vanstone, I believe?\" he began, with a\ncircular wave of his hand in the direction of the house. \"Have I the\nhonor of addressing a member of Mr. Vanstone's family?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the plain-spoken Miss Garth. \"You are addressing Mr.\nVanstone's governess.\"\n\nThe persuasive man fell back a step--admired Mr. Vanstone's\ngoverness--advanced a step again--and continued the conversation.\n\n\"And the two young ladies,\" he went on, \"the two young ladies who were\nwalking with you are doubtless Mr. Vanstone's daughters? I recognized\nthe darker of the two, and the elder as I apprehend, by her likeness to\nher handsome mother. The younger lady--\"\n\n\"You are acquainted with Mrs. Vanstone, I suppose?\" said Miss Garth,\ninterrupting the stranger's flow of language, which, all things\nconsidered, was beginning, in her opinion, to flow rather freely. The\nstranger acknowledged the interruption by one of his polite bows, and\nsubmerged Miss Garth in his next sentence as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"The younger lady,\" he proceeded, \"takes after her father, I presume? I\nassure you, her face struck me. Looking at it with my friendly interest\nin the family, I thought it very remarkable. I said to myself--Charming,\nCharacteristic, Memorable. Not like her sister, not like her mother. No\ndoubt, the image of her father?\"\n\nOnce more Miss Garth attempted to stem the man's flow of words. It was\nplain that he did not know Mr. Vanstone, even by sight--otherwise he\nwould never have committed the error of supposing that Magdalen took\nafter her father. Did he know Mrs. Vanstone any better? He had left Miss\nGarth's question on that point unanswered. In the name of wonder, who\nwas he? Powers of impudence! what did he want?\n\n\"You may be a friend of the family, though I don't remember your face,\"\nsaid Miss Garth. \"What may your commands be, if you please? Did you come\nhere to pay Mrs. Vanstone a visit?\"\n\n\"I had anticipated the pleasure of communicating with Mrs. Vanstone,\"\nanswered this inveterately evasive and inveterately civil man. \"How is\nshe?\"\n\n\"Much as usual,\" said Miss Garth, feeling her resources of politeness\nfast failing her.\n\n\"Is she at home?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Out for long?\"\n\n\"Gone to London with Mr. Vanstone.\"\n\nThe man's long face suddenly grew longer. His bilious brown eye looked\ndisconcerted, and his bilious green eye followed its example. His manner\nbecame palpably anxious; and his choice of words was more carefully\nselected than ever.\n\n\"Is Mrs. Vanstone's absence likely to extend over any very lengthened\nperiod?\" he inquired.\n\n\"It will extend over three weeks,\" replied Miss Garth. \"I think you have\nnow asked me questions enough,\" she went on, beginning to let her temper\nget the better of her at last. \"Be so good, if you please, as to mention\nyour business and your name. If you have any message to leave for Mrs.\nVanstone, I shall be writing to her by to-night's post, and I can take\ncharge of it.\"\n\n\"A thousand thanks! A most valuable suggestion. Permit me to take\nadvantage of it immediately.\"\n\nHe was not in the least affected by the severity of Miss Garth's looks\nand language--he was simply relieved by her proposal, and he showed it\nwith the most engaging sincerity. This time his bilious green eye took\nthe initiative, and set his bilious brown eye the example of recovered\nserenity. His curling lips took a new twist upward; he tucked his\numbrella briskly under his arm; and produced from the breast of his coat\na large old-fashioned black pocketbook. From this he took a pencil and\na card--hesitated and considered for a moment--wrote rapidly on the\ncard--and placed it, with the politest alacrity, in Miss Garth's hand.\n\n\"I shall feel personally obliged if you will honor me by inclosing that\ncard in your letter,\" he said. \"There is no necessity for my troubling\nyou additionally with a message. My name will be quite sufficient to\nrecall a little family matter to Mrs. Vanstone, which has no doubt\nescaped her memory. Accept my best thanks. This has been a day\nof agreeable surprises to me. I have found the country hereabouts\nremarkably pretty; I have seen Mrs. Vanstone's two charming daughters;\nI have become acquainted with an honored preceptress in Mr. Vanstone's\nfamily. I congratulate myself--I apologize for occupying your valuable\ntime--I beg my renewed acknowledgments--I wish you good-morning.\"\n\nHe raised his tall hat. His brown eye twinkled, his green eye twinkled,\nhis curly lips smiled sweetly. In a moment he turned on his heel. His\nyouthful back appeared to the best advantage; his active little legs\ntook him away trippingly in the direction of the village. One, two,\nthree--and he reached the turn in the road. Four, five, six--and he was\ngone.\n\nMiss Garth looked down at the card in her hand, and looked up again\nin blank astonishment. The name and address of the clerical-looking\nstranger (both written in pencil) ran as follows:\n\n_Captain Wragge. Post-office, Bristol._\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nWHEN she returned to the house, Miss Garth made no attempt to conceal\nher unfavorable opinion of the stranger in black. His object was, no\ndoubt, to obtain pecuniary assistance from Mrs. Vanstone. What the\nnature of his claim on her might be seemed less intelligible--unless it\nwas the claim of a poor relation. Had Mrs. Vanstone ever mentioned, in\nthe presence of her daughters, the name of Captain Wragge? Neither\nof them recollected to have heard it before. Had Mrs. Vanstone ever\nreferred to any poor relations who were dependent on her? On the\ncontrary she had mentioned of late years that she doubted having any\nrelations at all who were still living. And yet Captain Wragge had\nplainly declared that the name on his card would recall \"a family\nmatter\" to Mrs. Vanstone's memory. What did it mean? A false statement,\non the stranger's part, without any intelligible reason for making it?\nOr a second mystery, following close on the heels of the mysterious\njourney to London?\n\nAll the probabilities seemed to point to some hidden connection between\nthe \"family affairs\" which had taken Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone so suddenly\nfrom home and the \"family matter\" associated with the name of Captain\nWragge. Miss Garth's doubts thronged back irresistibly on her mind as\nshe sealed her letter to Mrs. Vanstone, with the captain's card added by\nway of inclosure.\n\nBy return of post the answer arrived.\n\nAlways the earliest riser among the ladies of the house, Miss Garth was\nalone in the breakfast-room when the letter was brought in. Her first\nglance at its contents convinced her of the necessity of reading it\ncarefully through in retirement, before any embarrassing questions could\nbe put to her. Leaving a message with the servant requesting Norah to\nmake the tea that morning, she went upstairs at once to the solitude and\nsecurity of her own room.\n\nMrs. Vanstone's letter extended to some length. The first part of it\nreferred to Captain Wragge, and entered unreservedly into all necessary\nexplanations relating to the man himself and to the motive which had\nbrought him to Combe-Raven.\n\nIt appeared from Mrs. Vanstone's statement that her mother had been\ntwice married. Her mother's first husband had been a certain Doctor\nWragge--a widower with young children; and one of those children was\nnow the unmilitary-looking captain, whose address was \"Post-office,\nBristol.\" Mrs. Wragge had left no family by her first husband; and had\nafterward married Mrs. Vanstone's father. Of that second marriage Mrs.\nVanstone herself was the only issue. She had lost both her parents\nwhile she was still a young woman; and, in course of years, her mother's\nfamily connections (who were then her nearest surviving relatives) had\nbeen one after another removed by death. She was left, at the present\nwriting, without a relation in the world--excepting, perhaps, certain\ncousins whom she had never seen, and of whose existence even, at the\npresent moment, she possessed no positive knowledge.\n\nUnder these circumstances, what family claim had Captain Wragge on Mrs.\nVanstone?\n\nNone whatever. As the son of her mother's first husband, by that\nhusband's first wife, not even the widest stretch of courtesy could have\nincluded him at any time in the list of Mrs. Vanstone's most distant\nrelations. Well knowing this (the letter proceeded to say), he had\nnevertheless persisted in forcing himself upon her as a species of\nfamily connection: and she had weakly sanctioned the intrusion,\nsolely from the dread that he would otherwise introduce himself to\nMr. Vanstone's notice, and take unblushing advantage of Mr. Vanstone's\ngenerosity. Shrinking, naturally, from allowing her husband to be\nannoyed, and probably cheated as well, by any person who claimed,\nhowever preposterously, a family connection with herself, it had been\nher practice, for many years past, to assist the captain from her own\npurse, on the condition that he should never come near the house, and\nthat he should not presume to make any application whatever to Mr.\nVanstone.\n\nReadily admitting the imprudence of this course, Mrs. Vanstone further\nexplained that she had perhaps been the more inclined to adopt it\nthrough having been always accustomed, in her early days, to see\nthe captain living now upon one member, and now upon another, of her\nmother's family. Possessed of abilities which might have raised him\nto distinction in almost any career that he could have chosen, he\nhad nevertheless, from his youth upward, been a disgrace to all his\nrelatives. He had been expelled the militia regiment in which he once\nheld a commission. He had tried one employment after another, and had\ndiscreditably failed in all. He had lived on his wits, in the lowest and\nbasest meaning of the phrase. He had married a poor ignorant woman, who\nhad served as a waitress at some low eating-house, who had unexpectedly\ncome into a little money, and whose small inheritance he had mercilessly\nsquandered to the last farthing. In plain terms, he was an incorrigible\nscoundrel; and he had now added one more to the list of his many\nmisdemeanors by impudently breaking the conditions on which Mrs.\nVanstone had hitherto assisted him. She had written at once to the\naddress indicated on his card, in such terms and to such purpose as\nwould prevent him, she hoped and believed, from ever venturing near the\nhouse again. Such were the terms in which Mrs. Vanstone concluded that\nfirst part of her letter which referred exclusively to Captain Wragge.\n\nAlthough the statement thus presented implied a weakness in Mrs.\nVanstone's character which Miss Garth, after many years of intimate\nexperience, had never detected, she accepted the explanation as a matter\nof course; receiving it all the more readily inasmuch as it might,\nwithout impropriety, be communicated in substance to appease the\nirritated curiosity of the two young ladies. For this reason especially\nshe perused the first half of the letter with an agreeable sense of\nrelief. Far different was the impression produced on her when she\nadvanced to the second half, and when she had read it to the end.\n\nThe second part of the letter was devoted to the subject of the journey\nto London.\n\nMrs. Vanstone began by referring to the long and intimate friendship\nwhich had existed between Miss Garth and herself. She now felt it due to\nthat friendship to explain confidentially the motive which had induced\nher to leave home with her husband. Miss Garth had delicately refrained\nfrom showing it, but she must naturally have felt, and must still be\nfeeling, great surprise at the mystery in which their departure had been\ninvolved; and she must doubtless have asked herself why Mrs. Vanstone\nshould have been associated with family affairs which (in her\nindependent position as to relatives) must necessarily concern Mr.\nVanstone alone.\n\nWithout touching on those affairs, which it was neither desirable nor\nnecessary to do, Mrs. Vanstone then proceeded to say that she would\nat once set all Miss Garth's doubts at rest, so far as they related to\nherself, by one plain acknowledgment. Her object in accompanying her\nhusband to London was to see a certain celebrated physician, and to\nconsult him privately on a very delicate and anxious matter connected\nwith the state of her health. In plainer terms still, this anxious\nmatter meant nothing less than the possibility that she might again\nbecome a mother.\n\nWhen the doubt had first suggested itself she had treated it as a mere\ndelusion. The long interval that had elapsed since the birth of her last\nchild; the serious illness which had afflicted her after the death\nof that child in infancy; the time of life at which she had now\narrived--all inclined her to dismiss the idea as soon as it arose in her\nmind. It had returned again and again in spite of her. She had felt the\nnecessity of consulting the highest medical authority; and had shrunk,\nat the same time, from alarming her daughters by summoning a London\nphysician to the house. The medical opinion, sought under the\ncircumstances already mentioned, had now been obtained. Her doubt was\nconfirmed as a certainty; and the result, which might be expected to\ntake place toward the end of the summer, was, at her age and with her\nconstitutional peculiarities, a subject for serious future anxiety, to\nsay the least of it. The physician had done his best to encourage her;\nbut she had understood the drift of his questions more clearly than\nhe supposed, and she knew that he looked to the future with more than\nordinary doubt.\n\nHaving disclosed these particulars, Mrs. Vanstone requested that they\nmight be kept a secret between her correspondent and herself. She had\nfelt unwilling to mention her suspicions to Miss Garth, until those\nsuspicions had been confirmed--and she now recoiled, with even greater\nreluctance, from allowing her daughters to be in any way alarmed about\nher. It would be best to dismiss the subject for the present, and to\nwait hopefully till the summer came. In the meantime they would all, she\ntrusted, be happily reunited on the twenty-third of the month, which Mr.\nVanstone had fixed on as the day for their return. With this intimation,\nand with the customary messages, the letter, abruptly and confusedly,\ncame to an end.\n\n\nFor the first few minutes, a natural sympathy for Mrs. Vanstone was the\nonly feeling of which Miss Garth was conscious after she had laid the\nletter down. Ere long, however, there rose obscurely on her mind a doubt\nwhich perplexed and distressed her. Was the explanation which she had\njust read really as satisfactory and as complete as it professed to be?\nTesting it plainly by facts, surely not.\n\nOn the morning of her departure, Mrs. Vanstone had unquestionably left\nthe house in good spirits. At her age, and in her state of health, were\ngood spirits compatible with such an errand to a physician as the errand\non which she was bent? Then, again, had that letter from New Orleans,\nwhich had necessitated Mr. Vanstone's departure, no share in occasioning\nhis wife's departure as well? Why, otherwise, had she looked up so\neagerly the moment her daughter mentioned the postmark. Granting the\navowed motive for her journey--did not her manner, on the morning when\nthe letter was opened, and again on the morning of departure, suggest\nthe existence of some other motive which her letter kept concealed?\n\nIf it was so, the conclusion that followed was a very distressing one.\nMrs. Vanstone, feeling what was due to her long friendship with Miss\nGarth, had apparently placed the fullest confidence in her, on one\nsubject, by way of unsuspiciously maintaining the strictest reserve\ntoward her on another. Naturally frank and straightforward in all her\nown dealings, Miss Garth shrank from plainly pursuing her doubts to\nthis result: a want of loyalty toward her tried and valued friend seemed\nimplied in the mere dawning of it on her mind.\n\nShe locked up the letter in her desk; roused herself resolutely to\nattend to the passing interests of the day; and went downstairs again\nto the breakfast-room. Amid many uncertainties, this at least was clear,\nMr. and Mrs. Vanstone were coming back on the twenty-third of the month.\nWho could say what new revelations might not come back with them?\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nNo new revelations came back with them: no anticipations associated with\ntheir return were realized. On the one forbidden subject of their errand\nin London, there was no moving either the master or the mistress of the\nhouse. Whatever their object might have been, they had to all appearance\nsuccessfully accomplished it--for they both returned in perfect\npossession of their every-day looks and manners. Mrs. Vanstone's spirits\nhad subsided to their natural quiet level; Mr. Vanstone's imperturbable\ncheerfulness sat as easily and indolently on him as usual. This was\nthe one noticeable result of their journey--this, and no more. Had the\nhousehold revolution run its course already? Was the secret thus far\nhidden impenetrably, hidden forever?\n\nNothing in this world is hidden forever. The gold which has lain for\ncenturies unsuspected in the ground, reveals itself one day on the\nsurface. Sand turns traitor, and betrays the footstep that has passed\nover it; water gives back to the tell-tale surface the body that has\nbeen drowned. Fire itself leaves the confession, in ashes, of the\nsubstance consumed in it. Hate breaks its prison-secrecy in the\nthoughts, through the doorway of the eyes; and Love finds the Judas\nwho betrays it by a kiss. Look where we will, the inevitable law of\nrevelation is one of the laws of nature: the lasting preservation of a\nsecret is a miracle which the world has never yet seen.\n\nHow was the secret now hidden in the household at Combe-Raven doomed\nto disclose itself? Through what coming event in the daily lives of\nthe father, the mother, and the daughters, was the law of revelation\ndestined to break the fatal way to discovery? The way opened (unseen by\nthe parents, and unsuspected by the children) through the first event\nthat happened after Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone's return--an event which\npresented, on the surface of it, no interest of greater importance than\nthe trivial social ceremony of a morning call.\n\nThree days after the master and mistress of Combe-Raven had come back,\nthe female members of the family happened to be assembled together\nin the morning-room. The view from the windows looked over the\nflower-garden and shrubbery; this last being protected at its outward\nextremity by a fence, and approached from the lane beyond by a\nwicket-gate. During an interval in the conversation, the attention of\nthe ladies was suddenly attracted to this gate, by the sharp sound of\nthe iron latch falling in its socket. Some one had entered the shrubbery\nfrom the lane; and Magdalen at once placed herself at the window to\ncatch the first sight of the visitor through the trees.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the figure of a gentleman became visible, at the\npoint where the shrubbery path joined the winding garden-walk which led\nto the house. Magdalen looked at him attentively, without appearing, at\nfirst, to know who he was. As he came nearer, however, she started in\nastonishment; and, turning quickly to her mother and sister, proclaimed\nthe gentleman in the garden to be no other than \"Mr. Francis Clare.\"\n\nThe visitor thus announced was the son of Mr. Vanstone's oldest\nassociate and nearest neighbor.\n\nMr. Clare the elder inhabited an unpretending little cottage, situated\njust outside the shrubbery fence which marked the limit of the\nCombe-Raven grounds. Belonging to the younger branch of a family of\ngreat antiquity, the one inheritance of importance that he had derived\nfrom his ancestors was the possession of a magnificent library, which\nnot only filled all the rooms in his modest little dwelling, but lined\nthe staircases and passages as well. Mr. Clare's books represented the\none important interest of Mr. Clare's life. He had been a widower for\nmany years past, and made no secret of his philosophical resignation to\nthe loss of his wife. As a father, he regarded his family of three sons\nin the light of a necessary domestic evil, which perpetually threatened\nthe sanctity of his study and the safety of his books. When the boys\nwent to school, Mr. Clare said \"good-by\" to them--and \"thank God\"\nto himself. As for his small income, and his still smaller domestic\nestablishment, he looked at them both from the same satirically\nindifferent point of view. He called himself a pauper with a pedigree.\nHe abandoned the entire direction of his household to the slatternly old\nwoman who was his only servant, on the condition that she was never to\nventure near his books, with a duster in her hand, from one year's\nend to the other. His favorite poets were Horace and Pope; his chosen\nphilosophers, Hobbes and Voltaire. He took his exercise and his fresh\nair under protest; and always walked the same distance to a yard, on the\nugliest high-road in the neighborhood. He was crooked of back, and quick\nof temper. He could digest radishes, and sleep after green tea.\nHis views of human nature were the views of Diogenes, tempered by\nRochefoucauld; his personal habits were slovenly in the last degree; and\nhis favorite boast was that he had outlived all human prejudices.\n\nSuch was this singular man, in his more superficial aspects. What\nnobler qualities he might possess below the surface, no one had ever\ndiscovered. Mr. Vanstone, it is true, stoutly asserted that \"Mr. Clare's\nworst side was his outside\"--but in this expression of opinion he\nstood alone among his neighbors. The association between these two\nwidely-dissimilar men had lasted for many years, and was almost close\nenough to be called a friendship. They had acquired a habit of\nmeeting to smoke together on certain evenings in the week, in the\ncynic-philosopher's study, and of there disputing on every imaginable\nsubject--Mr. Vanstone flourishing the stout cudgels of assertion, and\nMr. Clare meeting him with the keen edged-tools of sophistry. They\ngenerally quarreled at night, and met on the neutral ground of the\nshrubbery to be reconciled together the next morning. The bond of\nintercourse thus curiously established between them was strengthened\non Mr. Vanstone's side by a hearty interest in his neighbor's\nthree sons--an interest by which those sons benefited all the more\nimportantly, seeing that one of the prejudices which their father had\noutlived was a prejudice in favor of his own children.\n\n\"I look at those boys,\" the philosopher was accustomed to say, \"with\na perfectly impartial eye; I dismiss the unimportant accident of their\nbirth from all consideration; and I find them below the average in every\nrespect. The only excuse which a poor gentleman has for presuming to\nexist in the nineteenth century, is the excuse of extraordinary ability.\nMy boys have been addle-headed from infancy. If I had any capital to\ngive them, I should make Frank a butcher, Cecil a baker, and Arthur\na grocer--those being the only human vocations I know of which are\ncertain to be always in request. As it is, I have no money to help them\nwith; and they have no brains to help themselves. They appear to me\nto be three human superfluities in dirty jackets and noisy boots; and,\nunless they clear themselves off the community by running away, I don't\nmyself profess to see what is to be done with them.\"\n\nFortunately for the boys, Mr. Vanstone's views were still fast\nimprisoned in the ordinary prejudices. At his intercession, and through\nhis influence, Frank, Cecil, and Arthur were received on the foundation\nof a well-reputed grammar-school. In holiday-time they were mercifully\nallowed the run of Mr. Vanstone's paddock; and were humanized and\nrefined by association, indoors, with Mrs. Vanstone and her daughters.\nOn these occasions, Mr. Clare used sometimes to walk across from his\ncottage (in his dressing-gown and slippers), and look at the boys\ndisparagingly, through the window or over the fence, as if they were\nthree wild animals whom his neighbor was attempting to tame. \"You and\nyour wife are excellent people,\" he used to say to Mr. Vanstone. \"I\nrespect your honest prejudices in favor of those boys of mine with all\nmy heart. But you are _so_ wrong about them--you are indeed! I wish to\ngive no offense; I speak quite impartially--but mark my words, Vanstone:\nthey'll all three turn out ill, in spite of everything you can do to\nprevent it.\"\n\nIn later years, when Frank had reached the age of seventeen, the same\ncurious shifting of the relative positions of parent and friend between\nthe two neighbors was exemplified more absurdly than ever. A civil\nengineer in the north of England, who owed certain obligations to Mr.\nVanstone, expressed his willingness to take Frank under superintendence,\non terms of the most favorable kind. When this proposal was received,\nMr. Clare, as usual, first shifted his own character as Frank's father\non Mr. Vanstone's shoulders--and then moderated his neighbor's parental\nenthusiasm from the point of view of an impartial spectator.\n\n\"It's the finest chance for Frank that could possibly have happened,\"\ncried Mr. Vanstone, in a glow of fatherly enthusiasm.\n\n\"My good fellow, he won't take it,\" retorted Mr. Clare, with the icy\ncomposure of a disinterested friend.\n\n\"But he _shall_ take it,\" persisted Mr. Vanstone.\n\n\"Say he shall have a mathematical head,\" rejoined Mr. Clare; \"say he\nshall possess industry, ambition, and firmness of purpose. Pooh! pooh!\nyou don't look at him with my impartial eyes. I say, No mathematics, no\nindustry, no ambition, no firmness of purpose. Frank is a compound of\nnegatives--and there they are.\"\n\n\"Hang your negatives!\" shouted Mr. Vanstone. \"I don't care a rush\nfor negatives, or affirmatives either. Frank shall have this splendid\nchance; and I'll lay you any wager you like he makes the best of it.\"\n\n\"I am not rich enough to lay wagers, usually,\" replied Mr. Clare; \"but\nI think I have got a guinea about the house somewhere; and I'll lay you\nthat guinea Frank comes back on our hands like a bad shilling.\"\n\n\"Done!\" said Mr. Vanstone. \"No: stop a minute! I won't do the lad's\ncharacter the injustice of backing it at even money. I'll lay you five\nto one Frank turns up trumps in this business! You ought to be ashamed\nof yourself for talking of him as you do. What sort of hocus-pocus you\nbring it about by, I don't pretend to know; but you always end in making\nme take his part, as if I was his father instead of you. Ah yes! give\nyou time, and you'll defend yourself. I won't give you time; I won't\nhave any of your special pleading. Black's white according to you.\nI don't care: it's black for all that. You may talk nineteen to the\ndozen--I shall write to my friend and say Yes, in Frank's interests, by\nto-day's post.\"\n\nSuch were the circumstances under which Mr. Francis Clare departed for\nthe north of England, at the age of seventeen, to start in life as a\ncivil engineer.\n\nFrom time to time, Mr. Vanstone's friend communicated with him on the\nsubject of the new pupil. Frank was praised, as a quiet, gentleman-like,\ninteresting lad--but he was also reported to be rather slow at acquiring\nthe rudiments of engineering science. Other letters, later in date,\ndescribed him as a little too ready to despond about himself; as having\nbeen sent away, on that account, to some new railway works, to see\nif change of scene would rouse him; and as having benefited in every\nrespect by the experiment--except perhaps in regard to his professional\nstudies, which still advanced but slowly. Subsequent communications\nannounced his departure, under care of a trustworthy foreman, for some\npublic works in Belgium; touched on the general benefit he appeared to\nderive from this new change; praised his excellent manners and address,\nwhich were of great assistance in facilitating business communications\nwith the foreigners--and passed over in ominous silence the main\nquestion of his actual progress in the acquirement of knowledge. These\nreports, and many others which resembled them, were all conscientiously\npresented by Frank's friend to the attention of Frank's father. On\neach occasion, Mr. Clare exulted over Mr. Vanstone, and Mr. Vanstone\nquarreled with Mr. Clare. \"One of these days you'll wish you hadn't laid\nthat wager,\" said the cynic philosopher. \"One of these days I shall have\nthe blessed satisfaction of pocketing your guinea,\" cried the sanguine\nfriend. Two years had then passed since Frank's departure. In one year\nmore results asserted themselves, and settled the question.\n\nTwo days after Mr. Vanstone's return from London, he was called away\nfrom the breakfast-table before he had found time enough to look over\nhis letters, delivered by the morning's post. Thrusting them into one\nof the pockets of his shooting-jacket, he took the letters out again,\nat one grasp, to read them when occasion served, later in the day.\nThe grasp included the whole correspondence, with one exception--that\nexception being a final report from the civil engineer, which notified\nthe termination of the connection between his pupil and himself, and the\nimmediate return of Frank to his father's house.\n\nWhile this important announcement lay unsuspected in Mr. Vanstone's\npocket, the object of it was traveling home, as fast as railways could\ntake him. At half-past ten at night, while Mr. Clare was sitting in\nstudious solitude over his books and his green tea, with his favorite\nblack cat to keep him company, he heard footsteps in the passage--the\ndoor opened--and Frank stood before him.\n\nOrdinary men would have been astonished. But the philosopher's composure\nwas not to be shaken by any such trifle as the unexpected return of his\neldest son. He could not have looked up more calmly from his learned\nvolume if Frank had been absent for three minutes instead of three\nyears.\n\n\"Exactly what I predicted,\" said Mr. Clare. \"Don't interrupt me by\nmaking explanations; and don't frighten the cat. If there is anything\nto eat in the kitchen, get it and go to bed. You can walk over to\nCombe-Raven tomorrow and give this message from me to Mr. Vanstone:\n'Father's compliments, sir, and I have come back upon your hands like a\nbad shilling, as he always said I should. He keeps his own guinea, and\ntakes your five; and he hopes you'll mind what he says to you another\ntime.' That is the message. Shut the door after you. Good-night.\"\n\nUnder these unfavorable auspices, Mr. Francis Clare made his appearance\nthe next morning in the grounds at Combe-Raven; and, something doubtful\nof the reception that might await him, slowly approached the precincts\nof the house.\n\nIt was not wonderful that Magdalen should have failed to recognize\nhim when he first appeared in view. He had gone away a backward lad of\nseventeen; he returned a young man of twenty. His slim figure had now\nacquired strength and grace, and had increased in stature to the medium\nheight. The small regular features, which he was supposed to have\ninherited from his mother, were rounded and filled out, without having\nlost their remarkable delicacy of form. His beard was still in its\ninfancy; and nascent lines of whisker traced their modest way sparely\ndown his cheeks. His gentle, wandering brown eyes would have looked to\nbetter advantage in a woman's face--they wanted spirit and firmness to\nfit them for the face of a man. His hands had the same wandering habit\nas his eyes; they were constantly changing from one position to another,\nconstantly twisting and turning any little stray thing they could\npick up. He was undeniably handsome, graceful, well-bred--but no close\nobserver could look at him without suspecting that the stout old family\nstock had begun to wear out in the later generations, and that Mr.\nFrancis Clare had more in him of the shadow of his ancestors than of the\nsubstance.\n\nWhen the astonishment caused by his appearance had partially subsided,\na search was instituted for the missing report. It was found in the\nremotest recesses of Mr. Vanstone's capacious pocket, and was read by\nthat gentleman on the spot.\n\nThe plain facts, as stated by the engineer, were briefly these: Frank\nwas not possessed of the necessary abilities to fit him for his new\ncalling; and it was useless to waste time by keeping him any longer in\nan employment for which he had no vocation. This, after three years'\ntrial, being the conviction on both sides, the master had thought it the\nmost straightforward course for the pupil to go home and candidly place\nresults before his father and his friends. In some other pursuit, for\nwhich he was more fit, and in which he could feel an interest, he would\nno doubt display the industry and perseverance which he had been\ntoo much discouraged to practice in the profession that he had now\nabandoned. Personally, he was liked by all who knew him; and his future\nprosperity was heartily desired by the many friends whom he had made in\nthe North. Such was the substance of the report, and so it came to an\nend.\n\nMany men would have thought the engineer's statement rather too\ncarefully worded; and, suspecting him of trying to make the best of\na bad case, would have entertained serious doubts on the subject of\nFrank's future. Mr. Vanstone was too easy-tempered and sanguine--and too\nanxious, as well, not to yield his old antagonist an inch more ground\nthan he could help--to look at the letter from any such unfavorable\npoint of view. Was it Frank's fault if he had not got the stuff in him\nthat engineers were made of? Did no other young men ever begin life\nwith a false start? Plenty began in that way, and got over it, and\ndid wonders afterward. With these commentaries on the letter, the\nkind-hearted gentleman patted Frank on the shoulder. \"Cheer up, my lad!\"\nsaid Mr. Vanstone. \"We will be even with your father one of these days,\nthough he _has_ won the wager this time!\"\n\nThe example thus set by the master of the house was followed at once\nby the family--with the solitary exception of Norah, whose incurable\nformality and reserve expressed themselves, not too graciously, in her\ndistant manner toward the visitor. The rest, led by Magdalen (who had\nbeen Frank's favorite playfellow in past times) glided back into their\nold easy habits with him without an effort. He was \"Frank\" with all of\nthem but Norah, who persisted in addressing him as \"Mr. Clare.\" Even the\naccount he was now encouraged to give of the reception accorded to him\nby his father, on the previous night, failed to disturb Norah's gravity.\nShe sat with her dark, handsome face steadily averted, her eyes cast\ndown, and the rich color in her cheeks warmer and deeper than usual. All\nthe rest, Miss Garth included, found old Mr. Clare's speech of welcome\nto his son quite irresistible. The noise and merriment were at their\nheight when the servant came in, and struck the whole party dumb by\nthe announcement of visitors in the drawing-room. \"Mr. Marrable, Mrs.\nMarrable, and Miss Marrable; Evergreen Lodge, Clifton.\"\n\nNorah rose as readily as if the new arrivals had been a relief to her\nmind. Mrs. Vanstone was the next to leave her chair. These two went away\nfirst, to receive the visitors. Magdalen, who preferred the society of\nher father and Frank, pleaded hard to be left behind; but Miss Garth,\nafter granting five minutes' grace, took her into custody and marched\nher out of the room. Frank rose to take his leave.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Mr. Vanstone, detaining him. \"Don't go. These people\nwon't stop long. Mr. Marrable's a merchant at Bristol. I've met him once\nor twice, when the girls forced me to take them to parties at Clifton.\nMere acquaintances, nothing more. Come and smoke a cigar in the\ngreenhouse. Hang all visitors--they worry one's life out. I'll appear\nat the last moment with an apology; and you shall follow me at a safe\ndistance, and be a proof that I was really engaged.\"\n\nProposing this ingenious stratagem in a confidential whisper, Mr.\nVanstone took Frank's arm and led him round the house by the back way.\nThe first ten minutes of seclusion in the conservatory passed without\nevents of any kind. At the end of that time, a flying figure in bright\ngarments flashed upon the two gentlemen through the glass--the door was\nflung open--flower-pots fell in homage to passing petticoats--and Mr.\nVanstone's youngest daughter ran up to him at headlong speed, with every\nexternal appearance of having suddenly taken leave of her senses.\n\n\"Papa! the dream of my whole life is realized,\" she said, as soon as she\ncould speak. \"I shall fly through the roof of the greenhouse if somebody\ndoesn't hold me down. The Marrables have come here with an invitation.\nGuess, you darling--guess what they're going to give at Evergreen\nLodge!\"\n\n\"A ball!\" said Mr. Vanstone, without a moment's hesitation.\n\n\"Private Theatricals!!!\" cried Magdalen, her clear young voice ringing\nthrough the conservatory like a bell; her loose sleeves falling back and\nshowing her round white arms to the dimpled elbows, as she clapped her\nhands ecstatically in the air. \"'The Rivals' is the play, papa--'The\nRivals,' by the famous what's-his-name--and they want ME to act! The one\nthing in the whole universe that I long to do most. It all depends on\nyou. Mamma shakes her head; and Miss Garth looks daggers; and Norah's as\nsulky as usual--but if you say Yes, they must all three give way and\nlet me do as I like. Say Yes,\" she pleaded, nestling softly up to her\nfather, and pressing her lips with a fond gentleness to his ear, as she\nwhispered the next words. \"Say Yes, and I'll be a good girl for the rest\nof my life.\"\n\n\"A good girl?\" repeated Mr. Vanstone--\"a mad girl, I think you must\nmean. Hang these people and their theatricals! I shall have to go\nindoors and see about this matter. You needn't throw away your cigar,\nFrank. You're well out of the business, and you can stop here.\"\n\n\"No, he can't,\" said Magdalen. \"He's in the business, too.\"\n\nMr. Francis Clare had hitherto remained modestly in the background. He\nnow came forward with a face expressive of speechless amazement.\n\n\"Yes,\" continued Magdalen, answering his blank look of inquiry with\nperfect composure. \"You are to act. Miss Marrable and I have a turn for\nbusiness, and we settled it all in five minutes. There are two parts in\nthe play left to be filled. One is Lucy, the waiting-maid; which is the\ncharacter I have undertaken--with papa's permission,\" she added, slyly\npinching her father's arm; \"and he won't say No, will he? First, because\nhe's a darling; secondly, because I love him, and he loves me; thirdly,\nbecause there is never any difference of opinion between us (is there?);\nfourthly, because I give him a kiss, which naturally stops his mouth\nand settles the whole question. Dear me, I'm wandering. Where was I just\nnow? Oh yes! explaining myself to Frank--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" began Frank, attempting, at this point, to enter\nhis protest.\n\n\"The second character in the play,\" pursued Magdalen, without taking the\nsmallest notice of the protest, \"is Falkland--a jealous lover, with a\nfine flow of language. Miss Marrable and I discussed Falkland privately\non the window-seat while the rest were talking. She is a delightful\ngirl--so impulsive, so sensible, so entirely unaffected. She confided\nin me. She said: 'One of our miseries is that we can't find a gentleman\nwho will grapple with the hideous difficulties of Falkland.' Of course\nI soothed her. Of course I said: 'I've got the gentleman, and he\nshall grapple immediately.'--'Oh heavens! who is he?'--'Mr. Francis\nClare.'--'And where is he?'--'In the house at this moment.'--'Will you\nbe so very charming, Miss Vanstone, as to fetch him?'--'I'll fetch him,\nMiss Marrable, with the greatest pleasure.' I left the window-seat--I\nrushed into the morning-room--I smelled cigars--I followed the\nsmell--and here I am.\"\n\n\"It's a compliment, I know, to be asked to act,\" said Frank, in great\nembarrassment. \"But I hope you and Miss Marrable will excuse me--\"\n\n\"Certainly not. Miss Marrable and I are both remarkable for the firmness\nof our characters. When we say Mr. So-and-So is positively to act the\npart of Falkland, we positively mean it. Come in and be introduced.\"\n\n\"But I never tried to act. I don't know how.\"\n\n\"Not of the slightest consequence. If you don't know how, come to me and\nI'll teach you.\"\n\n\"You!\" exclaimed Mr. Vanstone. \"What do you know about it?\"\n\n\"Pray, papa, be serious! I have the strongest internal conviction that\nI could act every character in the play--Falkland included. Don't let me\nhave to speak a second time, Frank. Come and be introduced.\"\n\nShe took her father's arm, and moved on with him to the door of the\ngreenhouse. At the steps, she turned and looked round to see if Frank\nwas following her. It was only the action of a moment; but in\nthat moment her natural firmness of will rallied all its\nresources--strengthened itself with the influence of her beauty\n--commanded--and conquered. She looked lovely: the flush was tenderly\nbright in her cheeks; the radiant pleasure shone and sparkled in her\neyes; the position of her figure, turned suddenly from the waist upward,\ndisclosed its delicate strength, its supple firmness, its seductive,\nserpentine grace. \"Come!\" she said, with a coquettish beckoning action\nof her head. \"Come, Frank!\"\n\nFew men of forty would have resisted her at that moment. Frank was\ntwenty last birthday. In other words, he threw aside his cigar, and\nfollowed her out of the greenhouse.\n\nAs he turned and closed the door--in the instant when he lost sight of\nher--his disinclination to be associated with the private theatricals\nrevived. At the foot of the house-steps he stopped again; plucked a\ntwig from a plant near him; broke it in his hand; and looked about him\nuneasily, on this side and on that. The path to the left led back to his\nfather's cottage--the way of escape lay open. Why not take it?\n\nWhile he still hesitated, Mr. Vanstone and his daughter reached the\ntop of the steps. Once more, Magdalen looked round--looked with her\nresistless beauty, with her all-conquering smile. She beckoned again;\nand again he followed her--up the steps, and over the threshold. The\ndoor closed on them.\n\nSo, with a trifling gesture of invitation on one side, with a trifling\nact of compliance on the other: so--with no knowledge in his mind, with\nno thought in hers, of the secret still hidden under the journey to\nLondon--they took the way which led to that secret's discovery, through\nmany a darker winding that was yet to come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nMR. VANSTONE'S inquiries into the proposed theatrical entertainment at\nEvergreen Lodge were answered by a narrative of dramatic disasters; of\nwhich Miss Marrable impersonated the innocent cause, and in which her\nfather and mother played the parts of chief victims.\n\nMiss Marrable was that hardest of all born tyrants--an only child. She\nhad never granted a constitutional privilege to her oppressed father\nand mother since the time when she cut her first tooth. Her seventeenth\nbirthday was now near at hand; she had decided on celebrating it by\nacting a play; had issued her orders accordingly; and had been obeyed\nby her docile parents as implicitly as usual. Mrs. Marrable gave up the\ndrawing-room to be laid waste for a stage and a theater. Mr. Marrable\nsecured the services of a respectable professional person to drill the\nyoung ladies and gentlemen, and to accept all the other responsibilities\nincidental to creating a dramatic world out of a domestic chaos. Having\nfurther accustomed themselves to the breaking of furniture and the\nstaining of walls--to thumping, tumbling, hammering, and screaming; to\ndoors always banging, and to footsteps perpetually running up and down\nstairs--the nominal master and mistress of the house fondly believed\nthat their chief troubles were over. Innocent and fatal delusion! It is\none thing in private society to set up the stage and choose the play--it\nis another thing altogether to find the actors. Hitherto, only the small\npreliminary annoyances proper to the occasion had shown themselves at\nEvergreen Lodge. The sound and serious troubles were all to come.\n\n\"The Rivals\" having been chosen as the play, Miss Marrable, as a matter\nof course, appropriated to herself the part of \"Lydia Languish.\" One\nof her favored swains next secured \"Captain Absolute,\" and another laid\nviolent hands on \"Sir Lucius O'Trigger.\" These two were followed by\nan accommodating spinster relative, who accepted the heavy dramatic\nresponsibility of \"Mrs. Malaprop\"--and there the theatrical proceedings\ncame to a pause. Nine more speaking characters were left to be fitted\nwith representatives; and with that unavoidable necessity the serious\ntroubles began.\n\nAll the friends of the family suddenly became unreliable people, for the\nfirst time in their lives. After encouraging the idea of the play,\nthey declined the personal sacrifice of acting in it--or, they accepted\ncharacters, and then broke down in the effort to study them--or they\nvolunteered to take the parts which they knew were already engaged,\nand declined the parts which were waiting to be acted--or they were\nafflicted with weak constitutions, and mischievously fell ill when\nthey were wanted at rehearsal--or they had Puritan relatives in the\nbackground, and, after slipping into their parts cheerfully at the\nweek's beginning, oozed out of them penitently, under serious family\npressure, at the week's end. Meanwhile, the carpenters hammered and\nthe scenes rose. Miss Marrable, whose temperament was sensitive, became\nhysterical under the strain of perpetual anxiety; the family doctor\ndeclined to answer for the nervous consequences if something was not\ndone. Renewed efforts were made in every direction. Actors and actresses\nwere sought with a desperate disregard of all considerations of personal\nfitness. Necessity, which knows no law, either in the drama or out of\nit, accepted a lad of eighteen as the representative of \"Sir Anthony\nAbsolute\"; the stage-manager undertaking to supply the necessary\nwrinkles from the illimitable resources of theatrical art. A lady whose\nage was unknown, and whose personal appearance was stout--but whose\nheart was in the right place--volunteered to act the part of the\nsentimental \"Julia,\" and brought with her the dramatic qualification\nof habitually wearing a wig in private life. Thanks to these vigorous\nmeasures, the play was at last supplied with representatives--always\nexcepting the two unmanageable characters of \"Lucy\" the waiting-maid,\nand \"Falkland,\" Julia's jealous lover. Gentlemen came; saw Julia at\nrehearsal; observed her stoutness and her wig; omitted to notice that\nher heart was in the right place; quailed at the prospect, apologized,\nand retired. Ladies read the part of \"Lucy\"; remarked that she appeared\nto great advantage in the first half of the play, and faded out of it\naltogether in the latter half; objected to pass from the notice of\nthe audience in that manner, when all the rest had a chance of\ndistinguishing themselves to the end; shut up the book, apologized, and\nretired. In eight days more the night of performance would arrive;\na phalanx of social martyrs two hundred strong had been convened to\nwitness it; three full rehearsals were absolutely necessary; and two\ncharacters in the play were not filled yet. With this lamentable story,\nand with the humblest apologies for presuming on a slight acquaintance,\nthe Marrables appeared at Combe-Raven, to appeal to the young ladies\nfor a \"Lucy,\" and to the universe for a \"Falkland,\" with the mendicant\npertinacity of a family in despair.\n\nThis statement of circumstances--addressed to an audience which included\na father of Mr. Vanstone's disposition, and a daughter of Magdalen's\ntemperament--produced the result which might have been anticipated from\nthe first.\n\nEither misinterpreting, or disregarding, the ominous silence preserved\nby his wife and Miss Garth, Mr. Vanstone not only gave Magdalen\npermission to assist the forlorn dramatic company, but accepted an\ninvitation to witness the performance for Norah and himself. Mrs.\nVanstone declined accompanying them on account of her health; and Miss\nGarth only engaged to make one among the audience conditionally on not\nbeing wanted at home. The \"parts\" of \"Lucy\" and \"Falkland\" (which the\ndistressed family carried about with them everywhere, like incidental\nmaladies) were handed to their representatives on the spot. Frank's\nfaint remonstrances were rejected without a hearing; the days and hours\nof rehearsal were carefully noted down on the covers of the parts;\nand the Marrables took their leave, with a perfect explosion of\nthanks--father, mother, and daughter sowing their expressions of\ngratitude broadcast, from the drawing-room door to the garden-gates.\n\nAs soon as the carriage had driven away, Magdalen presented herself to\nthe general observation under an entirely new aspect.\n\n\"If any more visitors call to-day,\" she said, with the profoundest\ngravity of look and manner, \"I am not at home. This is a far more\nserious matter than any of you suppose. Go somewhere by yourself, Frank,\nand read over your part, and don't let your attention wander if you can\npossibly help it. I shall not be accessible before the evening. If\nyou will come here--with papa's permission--after tea, my views on the\nsubject of Falkland will be at your disposal. Thomas! whatever else\nthe gardener does, he is not to make any floricultural noises under my\nwindow. For the rest of the afternoon I shall be immersed in study--and\nthe quieter the house is, the more obliged I shall feel to everybody.\"\n\nBefore Miss Garth's battery of reproof could open fire, before the first\noutburst of Mr. Vanstone's hearty laughter could escape his lips, she\nbowed to them with imperturbable gravity; ascended the house-steps, for\nthe first time in her life, at a walk instead of a run, and retired then\nand there to the bedroom regions. Frank's helpless astonishment at her\ndisappearance added a new element of absurdity to the scene. He stood\nfirst on one leg and then on the other; rolling and unrolling his part,\nand looking piteously in the faces of the friends about him. \"I know\nI can't do it,\" he said. \"May I come in after tea, and hear Magdalen's\nviews? Thank you--I'll look in about eight. Don't tell my father about\nthis acting, please; I should never hear the last of it.\" Those were the\nonly words he had spirit enough to utter. He drifted away aimlessly\nin the direction of the shrubbery, with the part hanging open in his\nhand--the most incapable of Falklands, and the most helpless of mankind.\n\nFrank's departure left the family by themselves, and was the signal\naccordingly for an attack on Mr. Vanstone's inveterate carelessness in\nthe exercise of his paternal authority.\n\n\"What could you possibly be thinking of, Andrew, when you gave your\nconsent?\" said Mrs. Vanstone. \"Surely my silence was a sufficient\nwarning to you to say No?\"\n\n\"A mistake, Mr. Vanstone,\" chimed in Miss Garth. \"Made with the best\nintentions--but a mistake for all that.\"\n\n\"It may be a mistake,\" said Norah, taking her father's part, as usual.\n\"But I really don't see how papa, or any one else, could have declined,\nunder the circumstances.\"\n\n\"Quite right, my dear,\" observed Mr. Vanstone. \"The circumstances, as\nyou say, were dead against me. Here were these unfortunate people in a\nscrape on one side; and Magdalen, on the other, mad to act. I couldn't\nsay I had methodistical objections--I've nothing methodistical about\nme. What other excuse could I make? The Marrables are respectable\npeople, and keep the best company in Clifton. What harm can she get\nin their house? If you come to prudence and that sort of thing--why\nshouldn't Magdalen do what Miss Marrable does? There! there! let the\npoor things act, and amuse themselves. We were their age once--and it's\nno use making a fuss--and that's all I've got to say about it.\"\n\nWith that characteristic defense of his own conduct, Mr. Vanstone\nsauntered back to the greenhouse to smoke another cigar.\n\n\"I didn't say so to papa,\" said Norah, taking her mother's arm on the\nway back to the house, \"but the bad result of the acting, in my opinion,\nwill be the familiarity it is sure to encourage between Magdalen and\nFrancis Clare.\"\n\n\"You are prejudiced against Frank, my love,\" said Mrs. Vanstone.\n\nNorah's soft, secret, hazel eyes sank to the ground; she said no more.\nHer opinions were unchangeable--but she never disputed with anybody. She\nhad the great failing of a reserved nature--the failing of obstinacy;\nand the great merit--the merit of silence. \"What is your head running on\nnow?\" thought Miss Garth, casting a sharp look at Norah's dark, downcast\nface. \"You're one of the impenetrable sort. Give me Magdalen, with all\nher perversities; I can see daylight through her. You're as dark as\nnight.\"\n\nThe hours of the afternoon passed away, and still Magdalen remained shut\nup in her own room. No restless footsteps pattered on the stairs; no\nnimble tongue was heard chattering here, there, and everywhere, from the\ngarret to the kitchen--the house seemed hardly like itself, with the one\never-disturbing element in the family serenity suddenly withdrawn from\nit. Anxious to witness with her own eyes the reality of a transformation\nin which past experience still inclined her to disbelieve, Miss Garth\nascended to Magdalen's room, knocked twice at the door, received no\nanswer, opened it and looked in.\n\nThere sat Magdalen, in an arm-chair before the long looking-glass, with\nall her hair let down over her shoulders; absorbed in the study of her\npart and comfortably arrayed in her morning wrapper, until it was time\nto dress for dinner. And there behind her sat the lady's-maid, slowly\ncombing out the long heavy locks of her young mistress's hair, with the\nsleepy resignation of a woman who had been engaged in that employment\nfor some hours past. The sun was shining; and the green shutters outside\nthe window were closed. The dim light fell tenderly on the two quiet\nseated figures; on the little white bed, with the knots of rose-colored\nribbon which looped up its curtains, and the bright dress for dinner\nlaid ready across it; on the gayly painted bath, with its pure lining\nof white enamel; on the toilet-table with its sparkling trinkets, its\ncrystal bottles, its silver bell with Cupid for a handle, its litter\nof little luxuries that adorn the shrine of a woman's bed-chamber. The\nluxurious tranquillity of the scene; the cool fragrance of flowers and\nperfumes in the atmosphere; the rapt attitude of Magdalen, absorbed over\nher reading; the monotonous regularity of movement in the maid's\nhand and arm, as she drew the comb smoothly through and through her\nmistress's hair--all conveyed the same soothing impression of drowsy,\ndelicious quiet. On one side of the door were the broad daylight and the\nfamiliar realities of life. On the other was the dream-land of Elysian\nserenity--the sanctuary of unruffled repose.\n\nMiss Garth paused on the threshold, and looked into the room in silence.\n\nMagdalen's curious fancy for having her hair combed at all times\nand seasons was among the peculiarities of her character which were\nnotorious to everybody in the house. It was one of her father's favorite\njokes that she reminded him, on such occasions, of a cat having her back\nstroked, and that he always expected, if the combing were only continued\nlong enough, to hear her _purr_. Extravagant as it may seem, the\ncomparison was not altogether inappropriate. The girl's fervid\ntemperament intensified the essentially feminine pleasure that most\nwomen feel in the passage of the comb through their hair, to a\nluxury of sensation which absorbed her in enjoyment, so serenely\nself-demonstrative, so drowsily deep that it did irresistibly suggest a\npet cat's enjoyment under a caressing hand. Intimately as Miss Garth was\nacquainted with this peculiarity in her pupil, she now saw it asserting\nitself for the first time, in association with mental exertion of any\nkind on Magdalen's part. Feeling, therefore, some curiosity to know how\nlong the combing and the studying had gone on together, she ventured on\nputting the question, first to the mistress; and (receiving no answer in\nthat quarter) secondly to the maid.\n\n\"All the afternoon, miss, off and on,\" was the weary answer. \"Miss\nMagdalen says it soothes her feelings and clears her mind.\"\n\nKnowing by experience that interference would be hopeless, under these\ncircumstances, Miss Garth turned sharply and left the room. She\nsmiled when she was outside on the landing. The female mind does\noccasionally--though not often--project itself into the future. Miss\nGarth was prophetically pitying Magdalen's unfortunate husband.\n\nDinner-time presented the fair student to the family eye in the same\nmentally absorbed aspect. On all ordinary occasions Magdalen's appetite\nwould have terrified those feeble sentimentalists who affect to\nignore the all-important influence which female feeding exerts in the\nproduction of female beauty. On this occasion she refused one dish\nafter another with a resolution which implied the rarest of all modern\nmartyrdoms--gastric martyrdom. \"I have conceived the part of Lucy,\" she\nobserved, with the demurest gravity. \"The next difficulty is to make\nFrank conceive the part of Falkland. I see nothing to laugh at--you\nwould all be serious enough if you had my responsibilities. No, papa--no\nwine to-day, thank you. I must keep my intelligence clear. Water,\nThomas--and a little more jelly, I think, before you take it away.\"\n\nWhen Frank presented himself in the evening, ignorant of the\nfirst elements of his part, she took him in hand, as a middle-aged\nschoolmistress might have taken in hand a backward little boy. The few\nattempts he made to vary the sternly practical nature of the evening's\noccupation by slipping in compliments sidelong she put away from her\nwith the contemptuous self-possession of a woman of twice her age. She\nliterally forced him into his part. Her father fell asleep in his chair.\nMrs. Vanstone and Miss Garth lost their interest in the proceedings,\nretired to the further end of the room, and spoke together in whispers.\nIt grew later and later; and still Magdalen never flinched from her\ntask--still, with equal perseverance, Norah, who had been on the watch\nall through the evening, kept on the watch to the end. The distrust\ndarkened and darkened on her face as she looked at her sister and Frank;\nas she saw how close they sat together, devoted to the same interest\nand working to the same end. The clock on the mantel-piece pointed\nto half-past eleven before Lucy the resolute permitted Falkland the\nhelpless to shut up his task-book for the night. \"She's wonderfully\nclever, isn't she?\" said Frank, taking leave of Mr. Vanstone at the hall\ndoor. \"I'm to come to-morrow, and hear more of her views--if you have\nno objection. I shall never do it; don't tell her I said so. As fast as\nshe teaches me one speech, the other goes out of my head. Discouraging,\nisn't it? Goodnight.\"\n\nThe next day but one was the day of the first full rehearsal. On the\nprevious evening Mrs. Vanstone's spirits had been sadly depressed. At\na private interview with Miss Garth she had referred again, of her\nown accord, to the subject of her letter from London--had spoken\nself-reproachfully of her weakness in admitting Captain Wragge's\nimpudent claim to a family connection with her--and had then reverted to\nthe state of her health and to the doubtful prospect that awaited her in\nthe coming summer in a tone of despondency which it was very distressing\nto hear. Anxious to cheer her spirits, Miss Garth had changed the\nconversation as soon as possible--had referred to the approaching\ntheatrical performance--and had relieved Mrs. Vanstone's mind of all\nanxiety in that direction, by announcing her intention of accompanying\nMagdalen to each rehearsal, and of not losing sight of her until she\nwas safely back again in her father's house. Accordingly, when Frank\npresented himself at Combe-Raven on the eventful morning, there stood\nMiss Garth, prepared--in the interpolated character of Argus--to\naccompany Lucy and Falkland to the scene of trial. The railway conveyed\nthe three, in excellent time, to Evergreen Lodge; and at one o'clock the\nrehearsal began.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\n\"I HOPE Miss Vanstone knows her part?\" whispered Mrs. Marrable,\nanxiously addressing herself to Miss Garth, in a corner of the theater.\n\n\"If airs and graces make an actress, ma'am, Magdalen's performance will\nastonish us all.\" With that reply, Miss Garth took out her work, and\nseated herself, on guard, in the center of the pit.\n\nThe manager perched himself, book in hand, on a stool close in front of\nthe stage. He was an active little man, of a sweet and cheerful temper;\nand he gave the signal to begin with as patient an interest in the\nproceedings as if they had caused him no trouble in the past and\npromised him no difficulty in the future. The two characters which\nopened the comedy of The Rivals, \"Fag\" and \"The Coachman,\" appeared on\nthe scene--looked many sizes too tall for their canvas background, which\nrepresented a \"Street in Bath\"--exhibited the customary inability to\nmanage their own arms, legs, and voices--went out severally at the wrong\nexits--and expressed their perfect approval of results, so far,\nby laughing heartily behind the scenes. \"Silence, gentlemen, if you\nplease,\" remonstrated the cheerful manager. \"As loud as you like _on_\nthe stage, but the audience mustn't hear you _off_ it. Miss Marrable\nready? Miss Vanstone ready? Easy there with the 'Street in Bath';\nit's going up crooked! Face this way, Miss Marrable; full face, if you\nplease. Miss Vanstone--\" he checked himself suddenly. \"Curious,\" he\nsaid, under his breath--\"she fronts the audience of her own accord!\"\nLucy opened the scene in these words: \"Indeed, ma'am, I traversed half\nthe town in search of it: I don't believe there's a circulating library\nin Bath I haven't been at.\" The manager started in his chair. \"My heart\nalive! she speaks out without telling!\" The dialogue went on. Lucy\nproduced the novels for Miss Lydia Languish's private reading from under\nher cloak. The manager rose excitably to his feet. Marvelous! No hurry\nwith the books; no dropping them. She looked at the titles before she\nannounced them to her mistress; she set down \"Humphrey Clinker\" on\n\"The Tears of Sensibility\" with a smart little smack which pointed the\nantithesis. One moment--and she announced Julia's visit; another--and\nshe dropped the brisk waiting-maid's courtesy; a third--and she was off\nthe stage on the side set down for her in the book. The manager wheeled\nround on his stool, and looked hard at Miss Garth. \"I beg your pardon,\nma'am,\" he said. \"Miss Marrable told me, before we began, that this was\nthe young lady's first attempt. It can't be, surely!\"\n\n\"It is,\" replied Miss Garth, reflecting the manager's look of amazement\non her own face. Was it possible that Magdalen's unintelligible industry\nin the study of her part really sprang from a serious interest in her\noccupation--an interest which implied a natural fitness for it.\n\nThe rehearsal went on. The stout lady with the wig (and the excellent\nheart) personated the sentimental Julia from an inveterately tragic\npoint of view, and used her handkerchief distractedly in the first\nscene. The spinster relative felt Mrs. Malaprop's mistakes in language\nso seriously, and took such extraordinary pains with her blunders, that\nthey sounded more like exercises in elocution than anything else. The\nunhappy lad who led the forlorn hope of the company, in the person\nof \"Sir Anthony Absolute,\" expressed the age and irascibility of his\ncharacter by tottering incessantly at the knees, and thumping the\nstage perpetually with his stick. Slowly and clumsily, with constant\ninterruptions and interminable mistakes, the first act dragged on, until\nLucy appeared again to end it in soliloquy, with the confession of her\nassumed simplicity and the praise of her own cunning.\n\nHere the stage artifice of the situation presented difficulties which\nMagdalen had not encountered in the first scene--and here, her total\nwant of experience led her into more than one palpable mistake. The\nstage-manager, with an eagerness which he had not shown in the case of\nany other member of the company, interfered immediately, and set her\nright. At one point she was to pause, and take a turn on the stage--she\ndid it. At another, she was to stop, toss her head, and look pertly at\nthe audience--she did it. When she took out the paper to read the\nlist of the presents she had received, could she give it a tap with\nher finger (Yes)? And lead off with a little laugh (Yes--after twice\ntrying)? Could she read the different items with a sly look at the end\nof each sentence, straight at the pit (Yes, straight at the pit, and as\nsly as you please)? The manager's cheerful face beamed with approval.\nHe tucked the play under his arm, and clapped his hands gayly; the\ngentlemen, clustered together behind the scenes, followed his example;\nthe ladies looked at each other with dawning doubts whether they had not\nbetter have left the new recruit in the retirement of private life.\nToo deeply absorbed in the business of the stage to heed any of them,\nMagdalen asked leave to repeat the soliloquy, and make quite sure of her\nown improvement. She went all through it again without a mistake, this\ntime, from beginning to end; the manager celebrating her attention to\nhis directions by an outburst of professional approbation, which escaped\nhim in spite of himself. \"She can take a hint!\" cried the little man,\nwith a hearty smack of his hand on the prompt-book. \"She's a born\nactress, if ever there was one yet!\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Miss Garth to herself, taking up the work which had\ndropped into her lap, and looking down at it in some perplexity.\nHer worst apprehension of results in connection with the theatrical\nenterprise had foreboded levity of conduct with some of the\ngentlemen--she had not bargained for this. Magdalen, in the capacity of\na thoughtless girl, was comparatively easy to deal with. Magdalen, in\nthe character of a born actress, threatened serious future difficulties.\n\nThe rehearsal proceeded. Lucy returned to the stage for her scenes in\nthe second act (the last in which she appears) with Sir Lucius and Fag.\nHere, again, Magdalen's inexperience betrayed itself--and here once more\nher resolution in attacking and conquering her own mistakes astonished\neverybody. \"Bravo!\" cried the gentlemen behind the scenes, as she\nsteadily trampled down one blunder after another. \"Ridiculous!\" said the\nladies, \"with such a small part as hers.\" \"Heaven forgive me!\" thought\nMiss. Garth, coming round unwillingly to the general opinion. \"I almost\nwish we were Papists, and I had a convent to put her in to-morrow.\"\nOne of Mr. Marrable's servants entered the theater as that desperate\naspiration escaped the governess. She instantly sent the man behind the\nscene with a message: \"Miss Vanstone has done her part in the rehearsal;\nrequest her to come here and sit by me.\" The servant returned with\na polite apology: \"Miss Vanstone's kind love, and she begs to be\nexcused--she's prompting Mr. Clare.\" She prompted him to such purpose\nthat he actually got through his part. The performances of the\nother gentlemen were obtrusively imbecile. Frank was just one degree\nbetter--he was modestly incapable; and he gained by comparison. \"Thanks\nto Miss Vanstone,\" observed the manager, who had heard the prompting.\n\"She pulled him through. We shall be flat enough at night, when the drop\nfalls on the second act, and the audience have seen the last of her.\nIt's a thousand pities she hasn't got a better part!\"\n\n\"It's a thousand mercies she's no more to do than she has,\" muttered\nMiss Garth, overhearing him. \"As things are, the people can't well turn\nher head with applause. She's out of the play in the second act--that's\none comfort!\"\n\nNo well-regulated mind ever draws its inferences in a hurry; Miss\nGarth's mind was well regulated; therefore, logically speaking,\nMiss Garth ought to have been superior to the weakness of rushing at\nconclusions. She had committed that error, nevertheless, under present\ncircumstances. In plainer terms, the consoling reflection which had just\noccurred to her assumed that the play had by this time survived all its\ndisasters, and entered on its long-deferred career of success. The play\nhad done nothing of the sort. Misfortune and the Marrable family had not\nparted company yet.\n\nWhen the rehearsal was over, nobody observed that the stout lady with\nthe wig privately withdrew herself from the company; and when she was\nafterward missed from the table of refreshments, which Mr. Marrable's\nhospitality kept ready spread in a room near the theater, nobody\nimagined that there was any serious reason for her absence. It was not\ntill the ladies and gentlemen assembled for the next rehearsal that the\ntrue state of the case was impressed on the minds of the company. At\nthe appointed hour no Julia appeared. In her stead, Mrs. Marrable\nportentously approached the stage, with an open letter in her hand. She\nwas naturally a lady of the mildest good breeding: she was mistress of\nevery bland conventionality in the English language--but disasters and\ndramatic influences combined, threw even this harmless matron off her\nbalance at last. For the first time in her life Mrs. Marrable indulged\nin vehement gesture, and used strong language. She handed the letter\nsternly, at arms-length, to her daughter. \"My dear,\" she said, with an\naspect of awful composure, \"we are under a Curse.\" Before the amazed\ndramatic company could petition for an explanation, she turned and\nleft the room. The manager's professional eye followed her out\nrespectfully--he looked as if he approved of the exit, from a theatrical\npoint of view.\n\nWhat new misfortune had befallen the play? The last and worst of all\nmisfortunes had assailed it. The stout lady had resigned her part.\n\nNot maliciously. Her heart, which had been in the right place\nthroughout, remained inflexibly in the right place still. Her\nexplanation of the circumstances proved this, if nothing else did. The\nletter began with a statement: She had overheard, at the last rehearsal\n(quite unintentionally), personal remarks of which she was the\nsubject. They might, or might not, have had reference to her--Hair; and\nher--Figure. She would not distress Mrs. Marrable by repeating them.\nNeither would she mention names, because it was foreign to her nature\nto make bad worse. The only course at all consistent with her own\nself-respect was to resign her part. She inclosed it, accordingly, to\nMrs. Marrable, with many apologies for her presumption in undertaking a\nyouthful character, at--what a gentleman was pleased to term--her\nAge; and with what two ladies were rude enough to characterize as her\ndisadvantages of--Hair, and--Figure. A younger and more attractive\nrepresentative of Julia would no doubt be easily found. In the meantime,\nall persons concerned had her full forgiveness, to which she would only\nbeg leave to add her best and kindest wishes for the success of the\nplay.\n\nIn four nights more the play was to be performed. If ever any human\nenterprise stood in need of good wishes to help it, that enterprise was\nunquestionably the theatrical entertainment at Evergreen Lodge!\n\nOne arm-chair was allowed on the stage; and into that arm-chair Miss\nMarrable sank, preparatory to a fit of hysterics. Magdalen stepped\nforward at the first convulsion; snatched the letter from Miss\nMarrable's hand; and stopped the threatened catastrophe.\n\n\"She's an ugly, bald-headed, malicious, middle-aged wretch!\" said\nMagdalen, tearing the letter into fragments, and tossing them over the\nheads of the company. \"But I can tell her one thing--she shan't spoil\nthe play. I'll act Julia.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried the chorus of gentlemen--the anonymous gentleman who had\nhelped to do the mischief (otherwise Mr. Francis Clare) loudest of all.\n\n\"If you want the truth, I don't shrink from owning it,\" continued\nMagdalen. \"I'm one of the ladies she means. I said she had a head like a\nmop, and a waist like a bolster. So she has.\"\n\n\"I am the other lady,\" added the spinster relative. \"But I only said she\nwas too stout for the part.\"\n\n\"I am the gentleman,\" chimed in Frank, stimulated by the force of\nexample. \"I said nothing--I only agreed with the ladies.\"\n\nHere Miss Garth seized her opportunity, and addressed the stage loudly\nfrom the pit.\n\n\"Stop! Stop!\" she said. \"You can't settle the difficulty that way. If\nMagdalen plays Julia, who is to play Lucy?\"\n\nMiss Marrable sank back in the arm-chair, and gave way to the second\nconvulsion.\n\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" cried Magdalen, \"the thing's simple enough, I'll\nact Julia and Lucy both together.\"\n\nThe manager was consulted on the spot. Suppressing Lucy's first\nentrance, and turning the short dialogue about the novels into a\nsoliloquy for Lydia Languish, appeared to be the only changes of\nimportance necessary to the accomplishment of Magdalen's project.\nLucy's two telling scenes, at the end of the first and second acts, were\nsufficiently removed from the scenes in which Julia appeared to give\ntime for the necessary transformations in dress. Even Miss Garth, though\nshe tried hard to find them, could put no fresh obstacles in the way.\nThe question was settled in five minutes, and the rehearsal went on;\nMagdalen learning Julia's stage situations with the book in her hand,\nand announcing afterward, on the journey home, that she proposed sitting\nup all night to study the new part. Frank thereupon expressed his fears\nthat she would have no time left to help him through his theatrical\ndifficulties. She tapped him on the shoulder coquettishly with her part.\n\"You foolish fellow, how am I to do without you? You're Julia's jealous\nlover; you're always making Julia cry. Come to-night, and make me cry at\ntea-time. You haven't got a venomous old woman in a wig to act with now.\nIt's _my_ heart you're to break--and of course I shall teach you how to\ndo it.\"\n\n\nThe four days' interval passed busily in perpetual rehearsals, public\nand private. The night of performance arrived; the guests assembled; the\ngreat dramatic experiment stood on its trial. Magdalen had made the most\nof her opportunities; she had learned all that the manager could teach\nher in the time. Miss Garth left her when the overture began, sitting\napart in a corner behind the scenes, serious and silent, with her\nsmelling-bottle in one hand, and her book in the other, resolutely\ntraining herself for the coming ordeal, to the very last.\n\nThe play began, with all the proper accompaniments of a theatrical\nperformance in private life; with a crowded audience, an African\ntemperature, a bursting of heated lamp-glasses, and a difficulty in\ndrawing up the curtain. \"Fag\" and \"the Coachman,\" who opened the scene,\ntook leave of their memories as soon as they stepped on the stage;\nleft half their dialogue unspoken; came to a dead pause; were audibly\nentreated by the invisible manager to \"come off\"; and went off\naccordingly, in every respect sadder and wiser men than when they\nwent on. The next scene disclosed Miss Marrable as \"Lydia Languish,\"\ngracefully seated, very pretty, beautifully dressed, accurately mistress\nof the smallest words in her part; possessed, in short, of every\npersonal resource--except her voice. The ladies admired, the gentlemen\napplauded. Nobody heard anything but the words \"Speak up, miss,\"\nwhispered by the same voice which had already entreated \"Fag\" and \"the\nCoachman\" to \"come off.\" A responsive titter rose among the younger\nspectators; checked immediately by magnanimous applause. The temperature\nof the audience was rising to Blood Heat--but the national sense of fair\nplay was not boiled out of them yet.\n\nIn the midst of the demonstration, Magdalen quietly made her first\nentrance, as \"Julia.\" She was dressed very plainly in dark colors, and\nwore her own hair; all stage adjuncts and alterations (excepting the\nslightest possible touch of rouge on her cheeks) having been kept in\nreserve to disguise her the more effectually in her second part. The\ngrace and simplicity of her costume, the steady self-possession with\nwhich she looked out over the eager rows of faces before her, raised\na low hum of approval and expectation. She spoke--after suppressing a\nmomentary tremor--with a quiet distinctness of utterance which reached\nall ears, and which at once confirmed the favorable impression that her\nappearance had produced. The one member of the audience who looked at\nher and listened to her coldly, was her elder sister. Before the actress\nof the evening had been five minutes on the stage, Norah detected,\nto her own indescribable astonishment, that Magdalen had audaciously\nindividualized the feeble amiability of \"Julia's\" character, by seizing\nno less a person than herself as the model to act it by. She saw all\nher own little formal peculiarities of manner and movement unblushingly\nreproduced--and even the very tone of her voice so accurately mimicked\nfrom time to time, that the accents startled her as if she was\nspeaking herself, with an echo on the stage. The effect of this\ncool appropriation of Norah's identity to theatrical purposes on the\naudience--who only saw results--asserted itself in a storm of applause\non Magdalen's exit. She had won two incontestable triumphs in her first\nscene. By a dexterous piece of mimicry, she had made a living reality\nof one of the most insipid characters in the English drama; and she\nhad roused to enthusiasm an audience of two hundred exiles from the\nblessings of ventilation, all simmering together in their own animal\nheat. Under the circumstances, where is the actress by profession who\ncould have done much more?\n\nBut the event of the evening was still to come. Magdalen's disguised\nre-appearance at the end of the act, in the character of \"Lucy\"--with\nfalse hair and false eyebrows, with a bright-red complexion and patches\non her cheeks, with the gayest colors flaunting in her dress, and the\nshrillest vivacity of voice and manner--fairly staggered the audience.\nThey looked down at their programmes, in which the representative\nof Lucy figured under an assumed name; looked up again at the stage;\npenetrated the disguise; and vented their astonishment in another round\nof applause, louder and heartier even than the last. Norah herself\ncould not deny this time that the tribute of approbation had been well\ndeserved. There, forcing its way steadily through all the faults of\ninexperience--there, plainly visible to the dullest of the spectators,\nwas the rare faculty of dramatic impersonation, expressing itself in\nevery look and action of this girl of eighteen, who now stood on a stage\nfor the first time in her life. Failing in many minor requisites of the\ndouble task which she had undertaken, she succeeded in the one important\nnecessity of keeping the main distinctions of the two characters\nthoroughly apart. Everybody felt that the difficulty lay here--everybody\nsaw the difficulty conquered--everybody echoed the manager's enthusiasm\nat rehearsal, which had hailed her as a born actress.\n\nWhen the drop-scene descended for the first time, Magdalen had\nconcentrated in herself the whole interest and attraction of the play.\nThe audience politely applauded Miss Marrable, as became the guests\nassembled in her father's house: and good-humoredly encouraged the\nremainder of the company, to help them through a task for which they\nwere all, more or less, palpably unfit. But, as the play proceeded,\nnothing roused them to any genuine expression of interest when Magdalen\nwas absent from the scene. There was no disguising it: Miss Marrable and\nher bosom friends had been all hopelessly cast in the shade by the\nnew recruit whom they had summoned to assist them, in the capacity of\nforlorn hope. And this on Miss Marrable's own birthday! and this in her\nfather's house! and this after the unutterable sacrifices of six weeks\npast! Of all the domestic disasters which the thankless theatrical\nenterprise had inflicted on the Marrable family, the crowning misfortune\nwas now consummated by Magdalen's success.\n\nLeaving Mr. Vanstone and Norah, on the conclusion of the play, among the\nguests in the supper-room, Miss Garth went behind the scenes; ostensibly\nanxious to see if she could be of any use; really bent on ascertaining\nwhether Magdalen's head had been turned by the triumphs of the evening.\nIt would not have surprised Miss Garth if she had discovered her\npupil in the act of making terms with the manager for her forthcoming\nappearance in a public theater. As events really turned out, she found\nMagdalen on the stage, receiving, with gracious smiles, a card which the\nmanager presented to her with a professional bow. Noticing Miss Garth's\nmute look of inquiry, the civil little man hastened to explain that\nthe card was his own, and that he was merely asking the favor of Miss\nVanstone's recommendation at any future opportunity.\n\n\"This is not the last time the young lady will be concerned in\nprivate theatricals, I'll answer for it,\" said the manager. \"And if a\nsuperintendent is wanted on the next occasion, she has kindly promised\nto say a good word for me. I am always to be heard of, miss, at\nthat address.\" Saying those words, he bowed again, and discreetly\ndisappeared.\n\nVague suspicions beset the mind of Miss Garth, and urged her to insist\non looking at the card. No more harmless morsel of pasteboard was ever\npassed from one hand to another. The card contained nothing but the\nmanager's name, and, under it, the name and address of a theatrical\nagent in London.\n\n\"It is not worth the trouble of keeping,\" said Miss Garth.\n\nMagdalen caught her hand before she could throw the card away--possessed\nherself of it the next instant--and put it in her pocket.\n\n\"I promised to recommend him,\" she said--\"and that's one reason for\nkeeping his card. If it does nothing else, it will remind me of the\nhappiest evening of my life--and that's another. Come!\" she cried,\nthrowing her arms round Miss Garth with a feverish gayety--\"congratulate\nme on my success!\"\n\n\"I will congratulate you when you have got over it,\" said Miss Garth.\n\nIn half an hour more Magdalen had changed her dress; had joined the\nguests; and had soared into an atmosphere of congratulation high above\nthe reach of any controlling influence that Miss Garth could exercise.\nFrank, dilatory in all his proceedings, was the last of the dramatic\ncompany who left the precincts of the stage. He made no attempt to join\nMagdalen in the supper-room--but he was ready in the hall with her cloak\nwhen the carriages were called and the party broke up.\n\n\"Oh, Frank!\" she said, looking round at him as he put the cloak on her\nshoulders, \"I am so sorry it's all over! Come to-morrow morning, and\nlet's talk about it by ourselves.\"\n\n\"In the shrubbery at ten?\" asked Frank, in a whisper.\n\nShe drew up the hood of her cloak and nodded to him gayly. Miss Garth,\nstanding near, noticed the looks that passed between them, though the\ndisturbance made by the parting guests prevented her from hearing the\nwords. There was a soft, underlying tenderness in Magdalen's assumed\ngayety of manner--there was a sudden thoughtfulness in her face, a\nconfidential readiness in her hand, as she took Frank's arm and went out\nto the carriage. What did it mean? Had her passing interest in him as\nher stage-pupil treacherously sown the seeds of any deeper interest in\nhim, as a man? Had the idle theatrical scheme, now that it was all over,\ngraver results to answer for than a mischievous waste of time?\n\nThe lines on Miss Garth's face deepened and hardened: she stood lost\namong the fluttering crowd around her. Norah's warning words, addressed\nto Mrs. Vanstone in the garden, recurred to her memory--and now, for the\nfirst time, the idea dawned on her that Norah had seen the consequences\nin their true light.\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nEARLY the next morning Miss Garth and Norah met in the garden and spoke\ntogether privately. The only noticeable result of the interview, when\nthey presented themselves at the breakfast-table, appeared in the\nmarked silence which they both maintained on the topic of the theatrical\nperformance. Mrs. Vanstone was entirely indebted to her husband and\nto her youngest daughter for all that she heard of the evening's\nentertainment. The governess and the elder daughter had evidently\ndetermined on letting the subject drop.\n\nAfter breakfast was over Magdalen proved to be missing, when the ladies\nassembled as usual in the morning-room. Her habits were so little\nregular that Mrs. Vanstone felt neither surprise nor uneasiness at her\nabsence. Miss Garth and Norah looked at one another significantly,\nand waited in silence. Two hours passed--and there were no signs of\nMagdalen. Norah rose, as the clock struck twelve, and quietly left the\nroom to look for her.\n\nShe was not upstairs dusting her jewelry and disarranging her dresses.\nShe was not in the conservatory, not in the flower-garden; not in the\nkitchen teasing the cook; not in the yard playing with the dogs. Had\nshe, by any chance, gone out with her father? Mr. Vanstone had announced\nhis intention, at the breakfast-table, of paying a morning visit to\nhis old ally, Mr. Clare, and of rousing the philosopher's sarcastic\nindignation by an account of the dramatic performance. None of the other\nladies at Combe-Raven ever ventured themselves inside the cottage. But\nMagdalen was reckless enough for anything--and Magdalen might have gone\nthere. As the idea occurred to her, Norah entered the shrubbery.\n\nAt the second turning, where the path among the trees wound away out\nof sight of the house, she came suddenly face to face with Magdalen and\nFrank: they were sauntering toward her, arm in arm, their heads close\ntogether, their conversation apparently proceeding in whispers. They\nlooked suspiciously handsome and happy. At the sight of Norah both\nstarted, and both stopped. Frank confusedly raised his hat, and turned\nback in the direction of his father's cottage. Magdalen advanced to meet\nher sister, carelessly swinging her closed parasol from side to side,\ncarelessly humming an air from the overture which had preceded the\nrising of the curtain on the previous night.\n\n\"Luncheon-time already!\" she said, looking at her watch. \"Surely not?\"\n\n\"Have you and Mr. Francis Clare been alone in the shrubbery since ten\no'clock?\" asked Norah.\n\n\"_Mr._ Francis Clare! How ridiculously formal you are. Why don't you\ncall him Frank?\"\n\n\"I asked you a question, Magdalen.\"\n\n\"Dear me, how black you look this morning! I'm in disgrace, I suppose.\nHaven't you forgiven me yet for my acting last night? I couldn't help\nit, love; I should have made nothing of Julia, if I hadn't taken you\nfor my model. It's quite a question of Art. In your place, I should have\nfelt flattered by the selection.\"\n\n\"In _your_ place, Magdalen, I should have thought twice before I\nmimicked my sister to an audience of strangers.\"\n\n\"That's exactly why I did it--an audience of strangers. How were they\nto know? Come! come! don't be angry. You are eight years older than I\nam--you ought to set me an example of good-humor.\"\n\n\"I will set you an example of plain-speaking. I am more sorry than I can\nsay, Magdalen, to meet you as I met you here just now!\"\n\n\"What next, I wonder? You meet me in the shrubbery at home, talking over\nthe private theatricals with my old playfellow, whom I knew when I was\nno taller than this parasol. And that is a glaring impropriety, is it?\n'Honi soit qui mal y pense.' You wanted an answer a minute ago--there it\nis for you, my dear, in the choicest Norman-French.\"\n\n\"I am in earnest about this, Magdalen--\"\n\n\"Not a doubt of it. Nobody can accuse you of ever making jokes.\"\n\n\"I am seriously sorry--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\"\n\n\"It is quite useless to interrupt me. I have it on my conscience to tell\nyou--and I _will_ tell you--that I am sorry to see how this intimacy is\ngrowing. I am sorry to see a secret understanding established already\nbetween you and Mr. Francis Clare.\"\n\n\"Poor Frank! How you do hate him, to be sure. What on earth has he done\nto offend you?\"\n\nNorah's self-control began to show signs of failing her. Her dark cheeks\nglowed, her delicate lips trembled, before she spoke again. Magdalen\npaid more attention to her parasol than to her sister. She tossed it\nhigh in the air and caught it. \"Once!\" she said--and tossed it up again.\n\"Twice!\"--and she tossed it higher. \"Thrice--\" Before she could catch\nit for the third time, Norah seized her passionately by the arm, and the\nparasol dropped to the ground between them.\n\n\"You are treating me heartlessly,\" she said. \"For shame, Magdalen--for\nshame!\"\n\nThe irrepressible outburst of a reserved nature, forced into open\nself-assertion in its own despite, is of all moral forces the hardest\nto resist. Magdalen was startled into silence. For a moment, the two\nsisters--so strangely dissimilar in person and character--faced one\nanother, without a word passing between them. For a moment the deep\nbrown eyes of the elder and the light gray eyes of the younger looked\ninto each other with steady, unyielding scrutiny on either side. Norah's\nface was the first to change; Norah's head was the first to turn away.\nShe dropped her sister's arm in silence. Magdalen stooped and picked up\nher parasol.\n\n\"I try to keep my temper,\" she said, \"and you call me heartless for\ndoing it. You always were hard on me, and you always will be.\"\n\nNorah clasped her trembling hands fast in each other. \"Hard on you!\" she\nsaid, in low, mournful tones--and sighed bitterly.\n\nMagdalen drew back a little, and mechanically dusted the parasol with\nthe end of her garden cloak.\n\n\"Yes!\" she resumed, doggedly. \"Hard on me and hard on Frank.\"\n\n\"Frank!\" repeated Norah, advancing on her sister and turning pale as\nsuddenly as she had turned red. \"Do you talk of yourself and Frank as\nif your interests were One already? Magdalen! if I hurt _you_, do I hurt\n_him_? Is he so near and so dear to you as that?\"\n\nMagdalen drew further and further back. A twig from a tree near caught\nher cloak; she turned petulantly, broke it off, and threw it on the\nground. \"What right have you to question me?\" she broke out on a sudden.\n\"Whether I like Frank, or whether I don't, what interest is it of\nyours?\" As she said the words, she abruptly stepped forward to pass her\nsister and return to the house.\n\nNorah, turning paler and paler, barred the way to her. \"If I hold you by\nmain force,\" she said, \"you shall stop and hear me. I have watched\nthis Francis Clare; I know him better than you do. He is unworthy of a\nmoment's serious feeling on your part; he is unworthy of our dear, good,\nkind-hearted father's interest in him. A man with any principle, any\nhonor, any gratitude, would not have come back as he has come back,\ndisgraced--yes! disgraced by his spiritless neglect of his own duty. I\nwatched his face while the friend who has been better than a father\nto him was comforting and forgiving him with a kindness he had not\ndeserved: I watched his face, and I saw no shame and no distress in\nit--I saw nothing but a look of thankless, heartless relief. He is\nselfish, he is ungrateful, he is ungenerous--he is only twenty, and he\nhas the worst failings of a mean old age already. And this is the man I\nfind you meeting in secret--the man who has taken such a place in your\nfavor that you are deaf to the truth about him, even from _my_ lips!\nMagdalen! this will end ill. For God's sake, think of what I have\nsaid to you, and control yourself before it is too late!\" She stopped,\nvehement and breathless, and caught her sister anxiously by the hand.\n\nMagdalen looked at her in unconcealed astonishment.\n\n\"You are so violent,\" she said, \"and so unlike yourself, that I hardly\nknow you. The more patient I am, the more hard words I get for my pains.\nYou have taken a perverse hatred to Frank; and you are unreasonably\nangry with me because I won't hate him, too. Don't, Norah! you hurt my\nhand.\"\n\nNorah pushed the hand from her contemptuously. \"I shall never hurt your\nheart,\" she said; and suddenly turned her back on Magdalen as she spoke\nthe words.\n\nThere was a momentary pause. Norah kept her position. Magdalen looked\nat her perplexedly--hesitated--then walked away by herself toward the\nhouse.\n\nAt the turn in the shrubbery path she stopped and looked back uneasily.\n\"Oh, dear, dear!\" she thought to herself, \"why didn't Frank go when\nI told him?\" She hesitated, and went back a few steps. \"There's Norah\nstanding on her dignity, as obstinate as ever.\" She stopped again. \"What\nhad I better do? I hate quarreling: I think I'll make up.\" She ventured\nclose to her sister and touched her on the shoulder. Norah never moved.\n\"It's not often she flies into a passion,\" thought Magdalen, touching\nher again; \"but when she does, what a time it lasts her!--Come!\" she\nsaid, \"give me a kiss, Norah, and make it up. Won't you let me get at\nany part of you, my dear, but the back of your neck? Well, it's a very\nnice neck--it's better worth kissing than mine--and there the kiss is,\nin spite of you!\"\n\nShe caught fast hold of Norah from behind, and suited the action to\nthe word, with a total disregard of all that had just passed, which her\nsister was far from emulating. Hardly a minute since the warm outpouring\nof Norah's heart had burst through all obstacles. Had the icy reserve\nfrozen her up again already! It was hard to say. She never spoke;\nshe never changed her position--she only searched hurriedly for her\nhandkerchief. As she drew it out, there was a sound of approaching\nfootsteps in the inner recesses of the shrubbery. A Scotch terrier\nscampered into view; and a cheerful voice sang the first lines of\nthe glee in \"As You Like It.\" \"It's papa!\" cried Magdalen. \"Come,\nNorah--come and meet him.\"\n\nInstead of following her sister, Norah pulled down the veil of her\ngarden hat, turned in the opposite direction, and hurried back to the\nhouse. She ran up to her own room and locked herself in. She was crying\nbitterly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nWHEN Magdalen and her father met in the shrubbery Mr. Vanstone's face\nshowed plainly that something had happened to please him since he had\nleft home in the morning. He answered the question which his daughter's\ncuriosity at once addressed to him by informing her that he had just\ncome from Mr. Clare's cottage; and that he had picked up, in that\nunpromising locality, a startling piece of news for the family at\nCombe-Raven.\n\nOn entering the philosopher's study that morning, Mr. Vanstone had found\nhim still dawdling over his late breakfast, with an open letter by his\nside, in place of the book which, on other occasions, lay ready to his\nhand at meal-times. He held up the letter the moment his visitor came\ninto the room, and abruptly opened the conversation by asking Mr.\nVanstone if his nerves were in good order, and if he felt himself strong\nenough for the shock of an overwhelming surprise.\n\n\"Nerves!\" repeated Mr. Vanstone. \"Thank God, I know nothing about my\nnerves. If you have got anything to tell me, shock or no shock, out with\nit on the spot.\"\n\nMr. Clare held the letter a little higher, and frowned at his visitor\nacross the breakfast-table. \"What have I always told you?\" he asked,\nwith his sourest solemnity of look and manner.\n\n\"A great deal more than I could ever keep in my head,\" answered Mr.\nVanstone.\n\n\"In your presence and out of it,\" continued Mr. Clare, \"I have always\nmaintained that the one important phenomenon presented by modern society\nis--the enormous prosperity of Fools. Show me an individual Fool, and\nI will show you an aggregate Society which gives that highly-favored\npersonage nine chances out of ten--and grudges the tenth to the wisest\nman in existence. Look where you will, in every high place there sits\nan Ass, settled beyond the reach of all the greatest intellects in\nthis world to pull him down. Over our whole social system, complacent\nImbecility rules supreme--snuffs out the searching light of Intelligence\nwith total impunity--and hoots, owl-like, in answer to every form of\nprotest, See how well we all do in the dark! One of these days that\naudacious assertion will be practically contradicted, and the whole\nrotten system of modern society will come down with a crash.\"\n\n\"God forbid!\" cried Mr. Vanstone, looking about him as if the crash was\ncoming already.\n\n\"With a crash!\" repeated Mr. Clare. \"There is my theory, in few words.\nNow for the remarkable application of it which this letter suggests.\nHere is my lout of a boy--\"\n\n\"You don't mean that Frank has got another chance?\" exclaimed Mr.\nVanstone.\n\n\"Here is this perfectly hopeless booby, Frank,\" pursued the philosopher.\n\"He has never done anything in his life to help himself, and, as a\nnecessary consequence, Society is in a conspiracy to carry him to the\ntop of the tree. He has hardly had time to throw away that chance you\ngave him before this letter comes, and puts the ball at his foot for the\nsecond time. My rich cousin (who is intellectually fit to be at the tail\nof the family, and who is, therefore, as a matter of course, at the head\nof it) has been good enough to remember my existence; and has offered\nhis influence to serve my eldest boy. Read his letter, and then observe\nthe sequence of events. My rich cousin is a booby who thrives on\nlanded property; he has done something for another booby who thrives on\nPolitics, who knows a third booby who thrives on Commerce, who can do\nsomething for a fourth booby, thriving at present on nothing, whose name\nis Frank. So the mill goes. So the cream of all human rewards is sipped\nin endless succession by the Fools. I shall pack Frank off to-morrow. In\ncourse of time he'll come back again on our hands, like a bad shilling;\nmore chances will fall in his way, as a necessary consequence of his\nmeritorious imbecility. Years will go on--I may not live to see it,\nno more may you--it doesn't matter; Frank's future is equally certain\neither way--put him into the army, the Church, politics, what you\nplease, and let him drift: he'll end in being a general, a bishop, or\na minister of State, by dint of the great modern qualification of doing\nnothing whatever to deserve his place.\" With this summary of his son's\nworldly prospects, Mr. Clare tossed the letter contemptuously across the\ntable and poured himself out another cup of tea.\n\nMr. Vanstone read the letter with eager interest and pleasure. It was\nwritten in a tone of somewhat elaborate cordiality; but the practical\nadvantages which it placed at Frank's disposal were beyond all doubt.\nThe writer had the means of using a friend's interest--interest of no\nordinary kind--with a great Mercantile Firm in the City; and he had at\nonce exerted this influence in favor of Mr. Clare's eldest boy. Frank\nwould be received in the office on a very different footing from the\nfooting of an ordinary clerk; he would be \"pushed on\" at every available\nopportunity; and the first \"good thing\" the House had to offer, either\nat home or abroad, would be placed at his disposal. If he possessed fair\nabilities and showed common diligence in exercising them, his fortune\nwas made; and the sooner he was sent to London to begin the better for\nhis own interests it would be.\n\n\"Wonderful news!\" cried Mr. Vanstone, returning the letter. \"I'm\ndelighted--I must go back and tell them at home. This is fifty times\nthe chance that mine was. What the deuce do you mean by abusing Society?\nSociety has behaved uncommonly well, in my opinion. Where's Frank?\"\n\n\"Lurking,\" said Mr. Clare. \"It is one of the intolerable peculiarities\nof louts that they always lurk. I haven't seen _my_ lout this morning.\nIt you meet with him anywhere, give him a kick, and say I want him.\"\n\n\nMr. Clare's opinion of his son's habits might have been expressed\nmore politely as to form; but, as to substance, it happened, on that\nparticular morning, to be perfectly correct. After leaving Magdalen,\nFrank had waited in the shrubbery, at a safe distance, on the chance\nthat she might detach herself from her sister's company, and join him\nagain. Mr. Vanstone's appearance immediately on Norah's departure,\ninstead of encouraging him to show himself, had determined him on\nreturning to the cottage. He walked back discontentedly; and so\nfell into his father's clutches, totally unprepared for the pending\nannouncement, in that formidable quarter, of his departure for London.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Vanstone had communicated his news--in the first\nplace, to Magdalen, and afterward, on getting back to the house, to\nhis wife and Miss Garth. He was too unobservant a man to notice that\nMagdalen looked unaccountably startled, and Miss Garth unaccountably\nrelieved, by his announcement of Frank's good fortune. He talked on\nabout it, quite unsuspiciously, until the luncheon-bell rang--and then,\nfor the first time, he noticed Norah's absence. She sent a message\ndownstairs, after they had assembled at the table, to say that a\nheadache was keeping her in her own room. When Miss Garth went up\nshortly afterward to communicate the news about Frank, Norah appeared,\nstrangely enough, to feel very little relieved by hearing it. Mr.\nFrancis Clare had gone away on a former occasion (she remarked), and had\ncome back. He might come back again, and sooner than they any of them\nthought for. She said no more on the subject than this: she made no\nreference to what had taken place in the shrubbery. Her unconquerable\nreserve seemed to have strengthened its hold on her since the outburst\nof the morning. She met Magdalen, later in the day, as if nothing had\nhappened: no formal reconciliation took place between them. It was one\nof Norah's peculiarities to shrink from all reconciliations that were\nopenly ratified, and to take her shy refuge in reconciliations that were\nsilently implied. Magdalen saw plainly, in her look and manner, that she\nhad made her first and last protest. Whether the motive was pride, or\nsullenness, or distrust of herself, or despair of doing good, the result\nwas not to be mistaken--Norah had resolved on remaining passive for the\nfuture.\n\nLater in the afternoon, Mr. Vanstone suggested a drive to his eldest\ndaughter, as the best remedy for her headache. She readily consented to\naccompany her father; who thereupon proposed, as usual, that Magdalen\nshould join them. Magdalen was nowhere to be found. For the second time\nthat day she had wandered into the grounds by herself. On this occasion,\nMiss Garth--who, after adopting Norah's opinions, had passed from the\none extreme of over-looking Frank altogether, to the other extreme\nof believing him capable of planning an elopement at five minutes'\nnotice--volunteered to set forth immediately, and do her best to\nfind the missing young lady. After a prolonged absence, she returned\nunsuccessful--with the strongest persuasion in her own mind that\nMagdalen and Frank had secretly met one another somewhere, but without\nhaving discovered the smallest fragment of evidence to confirm her\nsuspicions. By this time the carriage was at the door, and Mr. Vanstone\nwas unwilling to wait any longer. He and Norah drove away together; and\nMrs. Vanstone and Miss Garth sat at home over their work.\n\nIn half an hour more, Magdalen composedly walked into the room. She was\npale and depressed. She received Miss Garth's remonstrances with a weary\ninattention; explained carelessly that she had been wandering in the\nwood; took up some books, and put them down again; sighed impatiently,\nand went away upstairs to her own room.\n\n\"I think Magdalen is feeling the reaction, after yesterday,\" said\nMrs. Vanstone, quietly. \"It is just as we thought. Now the theatrical\namusements are all over, she is fretting for more.\"\n\nHere was an opportunity of letting in the light of truth on Mrs.\nVanstone's mind, which was too favorable to be missed. Miss Garth\nquestioned her conscience, saw her chance, and took it on the spot.\n\n\"You forget,\" she rejoined, \"that a certain neighbor of ours is going\naway to-morrow. Shall I tell you the truth? Magdalen is fretting over\nthe departure of Francis Clare.\"\n\nMrs. Vanstone looked up from her work with a gentle, smiling surprise.\n\n\"Surely not?\" she said. \"It is natural enough that Frank should be\nattracted by Magdalen; but I can't think that Magdalen returns the\nfeeling. Frank is so very unlike her; so quiet and undemonstrative; so\ndull and helpless, poor fellow, in some things. He is handsome, I\nknow, but he is so singularly unlike Magdalen, that I can't think it\npossible--I can't indeed.\"\n\n\"My dear good lady!\" cried Miss Garth, in great amazement; \"do you\nreally suppose that people fall in love with each other on account of\nsimilarities in their characters? In the vast majority of cases, they do\njust the reverse. Men marry the very last women, and women the very last\nmen, whom their friends would think it possible they could care about.\nIs there any phrase that is oftener on all our lips than 'What can have\nmade Mr. So-and-So marry that woman?'--or 'How could Mrs. So-and-So\nthrow herself away on that man?' Has all your experience of the world\nnever yet shown you that girls take perverse fancies for men who are\ntotally unworthy of them?\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said Mrs. Vanstone, composedly. \"I forgot that. Still it\nseems unaccountable, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"Unaccountable, because it happens every day!\" retorted Miss Garth,\ngood-humoredly. \"I know a great many excellent people who reason\nagainst plain experience in the same way--who read the newspapers in the\nmorning, and deny in the evening that there is any romance for writers\nor painters to work upon in modern life. Seriously, Mrs. Vanstone, you\nmay take my word for it--thanks to those wretched theatricals, Magdalen\nis going the way with Frank that a great many young ladies have gone\nbefore her. He is quite unworthy of her; he is, in almost every respect,\nher exact opposite--and, without knowing it herself, she has fallen\nin love with him on that very account. She is resolute and impetuous,\nclever and domineering; she is not one of those model women who want a\nman to look up to, and to protect them--her beau-ideal (though she may\nnot think it herself) is a man she can henpeck. Well! one comfort is,\nthere are far better men, even of that sort, to be had than Frank. It's\na mercy he is going away, before we have more trouble with them, and\nbefore any serious mischief is done.\"\n\n\"Poor Frank!\" said Mrs. Vanstone, smiling compassionately. \"We have\nknown him since he was in jackets, and Magdalen in short frocks. Don't\nlet us give him up yet. He may do better this second time.\"\n\nMiss Garth looked up in astonishment.\n\n\"And suppose he does better?\" she asked. \"What then?\"\n\nMrs. Vanstone cut off a loose thread in her work, and laughed outright.\n\n\"My good friend,\" she said, \"there is an old farmyard proverb which\nwarns us not to count our chickens before they are hatched. Let us wait\na little before we count ours.\"\n\nIt was not easy to silence Miss Garth, when she was speaking under the\ninfluence of a strong conviction; but this reply closed her lips. She\nresumed her work, and looked, and thought, unutterable things.\n\nMrs. Vanstone's behavior was certainly remarkable under the\ncircumstances. Here, on one side, was a girl--with great personal\nattractions, with rare pecuniary prospects, with a social position which\nmight have justified the best gentleman in the neighborhood in making\nher an offer of marriage--perversely casting herself away on a penniless\nidle young fellow, who had failed at his first start in life, and who\neven if he succeeded in his second attempt, must be for years to come in\nno position to marry a young lady of fortune on equal terms. And there,\non the other side, was that girl's mother, by no means dismayed at the\nprospect of a connection which was, to say the least of it, far from\ndesirable; by no means certain, judging her by her own words and looks,\nthat a marriage between Mr. Vanstone's daughter and Mr. Clare's son\nmight not prove to be as satisfactory a result of the intimacy between\nthe two young people as the parents on both sides could possibly wish\nfor!\n\nIt was perplexing in the extreme. It was almost as unintelligible as\nthat past mystery--that forgotten mystery now--of the journey to London.\n\n\nIn the evening, Frank made his appearance, and announced that his father\nhad mercilessly sentenced him to leave Combe-Raven by the parliamentary\ntrain the next morning. He mentioned this circumstance with an air\nof sentimental resignation; and listened to Mr. Vanstone's boisterous\nrejoicings over his new prospects with a mild and mute surprise. His\ngentle melancholy of look and manner greatly assisted his personal\nadvantages. In his own effeminate way he was more handsome than ever\nthat evening. His soft brown eyes wandered about the room with a melting\ntenderness; his hair was beautifully brushed; his delicate hands hung\nover the arms of his chair with a languid grace. He looked like a\nconvalescent Apollo. Never, on any previous occasion, had he practiced\nmore successfully the social art which he habitually cultivated--the art\nof casting himself on society in the character of a well-bred Incubus,\nand conferring an obligation on his fellow-creatures by allowing them to\nsit under him. It was undeniably a dull evening. All the talking fell to\nthe share of Mr. Vanstone and Miss Garth. Mrs. Vanstone was habitually\nsilent; Norah kept herself obstinately in the background; Magdalen was\nquiet and undemonstrative beyond all former precedent. From first to\nlast, she kept rigidly on her guard. The few meaning looks that she cast\non Frank flashed at him like lightning, and were gone before any one\nelse could see them. Even when she brought him his tea; and when, in\ndoing so, her self-control gave way under the temptation which no woman\ncan resist--the temptation of touching the man she loves--even then,\nshe held the saucer so dexterously that it screened her hand. Frank's\nself-possession was far less steadily disciplined: it only lasted as\nlong as he remained passive. When he rose to go; when he felt the warm,\nclinging pressure of Magdalen's fingers round his hand, and the lock of\nher hair which she slipped into it at the same moment, he became awkward\nand confused. He might have betrayed Magdalen and betrayed himself, but\nfor Mr. Vanstone, who innocently covered his retreat by following\nhim out, and patting him on the shoulder all the way. \"God bless you,\nFrank!\" cried the friendly voice that never had a harsh note in it for\nanybody. \"Your fortune's waiting for you. Go in, my boy--go in and win.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Frank. \"Thank you. It will be rather difficult to go in and\nwin, at first. Of course, as you have always told me, a man's business\nis to conquer his difficulties, and not to talk about them. At the same\ntime, I wish I didn't feel quite so loose as I do in my figures. It's\ndiscouraging to feel loose in one's figures.--Oh, yes; I'll write and\ntell you how I get on. I'm very much obliged by your kindness, and very\nsorry I couldn't succeed with the engineering. I think I should have\nliked engineering better than trade. It can't be helped now, can it?\nThank you, again. Good-by.\"\n\nSo he drifted away into the misty commercial future--as aimless, as\nhelpless, as gentleman-like as ever.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHREE months passed. During that time Frank remained in London; pursuing\nhis new duties, and writing occasionally to report himself to Mr.\nVanstone, as he had promised.\n\nHis letters were not enthusiastic on the subject of mercantile\noccupations. He described himself as being still painfully loose in his\nfigures. He was also more firmly persuaded than ever--now when it was\nunfortunately too late--that he preferred engineering to trade. In spite\nof this conviction; in spite of headaches caused by sitting on a high\nstool and stooping over ledgers in unwholesome air; in spite of want\nof society, and hasty breakfasts, and bad dinners at chop-houses, his\nattendance at the office was regular, and his diligence at the desk\nunremitting. The head of the department in which he was working might be\nreferred to if any corroboration of this statement was desired. Such was\nthe general tenor of the letters; and Frank's correspondent and Frank's\nfather differed over them as widely as usual. Mr. Vanstone accepted them\nas proofs of the steady development of industrious principles in the\nwriter. Mr. Clare took his own characteristically opposite view. \"These\nLondon men,\" said the philosopher, \"are not to be trifled with by\nlouts. They have got Frank by the scruff of the neck--he can't wriggle\nhimself free--and he makes a merit of yielding to sheer necessity.\"\n\nThe three months' interval of Frank's probation in London passed less\ncheerfully than usual in the household at Combe-Raven.\n\nAs the summer came nearer and nearer, Mrs. Vanstone's spirits, in spite\nof her resolute efforts to control them, became more and more depressed.\n\n\"I do my best,\" she said to Miss Garth; \"I set an example of\ncheerfulness to my husband and my children--but I dread July.\" Norah's\nsecret misgivings on her sister's account rendered her more than usually\nserious and uncommunicative, as the year advanced. Even Mr. Vanstone,\nwhen July drew nearer, lost something of his elasticity of spirit. He\nkept up appearances in his wife's presence--but on all other occasions\nthere was now a perceptible shade of sadness in his look and manner.\nMagdalen was so changed since Frank's departure that she helped the\ngeneral depression, instead of relieving it. All her movements had grown\nlanguid; all her usual occupations were pursued with the same weary\nindifference; she spent hours alone in her own room; she lost her\ninterest in being brightly and prettily dressed; her eyes were heavy,\nher nerves were irritable, her complexion was altered visibly for the\nworse--in one word, she had become an oppression and a weariness to\nherself and to all about her. Stoutly as Miss Garth contended with these\ngrowing domestic difficulties, her own spirits suffered in the effort.\nHer memory reverted, oftener and oftener, to the March morning when the\nmaster and mistress of the house had departed for London, and then the\nfirst serious change, for many a year past, had stolen over the family\natmosphere. When was that atmosphere to be clear again? When were the\nclouds of change to pass off before the returning sunshine of past and\nhappier times?\n\nThe spring and the early summer wore away. The dreaded month of July\ncame, with its airless nights, its cloudless mornings, and its sultry\ndays.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the month, an event happened which took every\none but Norah by surprise. For the second time, without the slightest\napparent reason--for the second time, without a word of warning\nbeforehand--Frank suddenly re-appeared at his father's cottage.\n\nMr. Clare's lips opened to hail his son's return, in the old character\nof the \"bad shilling\"; and closed again without uttering a word. There\nwas a portentous composure in Frank's manner which showed that he had\nother news to communicate than the news of his dismissal. He answered\nhis father's sardonic look of inquiry by at once explaining that a very\nimportant proposal for his future benefit had been made to him, that\nmorning, at the office. His first idea had been to communicate the\ndetails in writing; but the partners had, on reflection, thought that\nthe necessary decision might be more readily obtained by a personal\ninterview with his father and his friends. He had laid aside the pen\naccordingly, and had resigned himself to the railway on the spot.\n\nAfter this preliminary statement, Frank proceeded to describe the\nproposal which his employers had addressed to him, with every external\nappearance of viewing it in the light of an intolerable hardship.\n\nThe great firm in the City had obviously made a discovery in relation to\ntheir clerk, exactly similar to the discovery which had formerly forced\nitself on the engineer in relation to his pupil. The young man, as they\npolitely phrased it, stood in need of some special stimulant to stir\nhim up. His employers (acting under a sense of their obligation to\nthe gentleman by whom Frank had been recommended) had considered the\nquestion carefully, and had decided that the one promising use to which\nthey could put Mr. Francis Clare was to send him forthwith into another\nquarter of the globe.\n\nAs a consequence of this decision, it was now, therefore, proposed that\nhe should enter the house of their correspondents in China; that he\nshould remain there, familiarizing himself thoroughly on the spot with\nthe tea trade and the silk trade for five years; and that he should\nreturn, at the expiration of this period, to the central establishment\nin London. If he made a fair use of his opportunities in China, he would\ncome back, while still a young man, fit for a position of trust and\nemolument, and justified in looking forward, at no distant date, to a\ntime when the House would assist him to start in business for himself.\nSuch were the new prospects which--to adopt Mr. Clare's theory--now\nforced themselves on the ever-reluctant, ever-helpless and\never-ungrateful Frank. There was no time to be lost. The final answer\nwas to be at the office on \"Monday, the twentieth\": the correspondents\nin China were to be written to by the mail on that day; and Frank was\nto follow the letter by the next opportunity, or to resign his chance in\nfavor of some more enterprising young man.\n\nMr. Clare's reception of this extraordinary news was startling in the\nextreme. The glorious prospect of his son's banishment to China appeared\nto turn his brain. The firm pedestal of his philosophy sank under him;\nthe prejudices of society recovered their hold on his mind. He seized\nFrank by the arm, and actually accompanied him to Combe-Raven, in the\namazing character of visitor to the house!\n\n\"Here I am with my lout,\" said Mr. Clare, before a word could be uttered\nby the astonished family. \"Hear his story, all of you. It has reconciled\nme, for the first time in my life, to the anomaly of his existence.\"\nFrank ruefully narrated the Chinese proposal for the second time, and\nattempted to attach to it his own supplementary statement of objections\nand difficulties. His father stopped him at the first word, pointed\nperemptorily southeastward (from Somersetshire to China); and said,\nwithout an instant's hesitation: \"Go!\" Mr. Vanstone, basking in golden\nvisions of his young friend's future, echoed that monosyllabic decision\nwith all his heart. Mrs. Vanstone, Miss Garth, even Norah herself, spoke\nto the same purpose. Frank was petrified by an absolute unanimity of\nopinion which he had not anticipated; and Magdalen was caught, for once\nin her life, at the end of all her resources.\n\nSo far as practical results were concerned, the sitting of the family\ncouncil began and ended with the general opinion that Frank must go. Mr.\nVanstone's faculties were so bewildered by the son's sudden arrival,\nthe father's unexpected visit, and the news they both brought with them,\nthat he petitioned for an adjournment before the necessary arrangements\nconnected with his young friend's departure were considered in detail.\n\"Suppose we all sleep upon it?\" he said. \"Tomorrow our heads will feel\na little steadier; and to-morrow will be time enough to decide all\nuncertainties.\" This suggestion was readily adopted; and all further\nproceedings stood adjourned until the next day.\n\nThat next day was destined to decide more uncertainties than Mr.\nVanstone dreamed of.\n\n\nEarly in the morning, after making tea by herself as usual, Miss Garth\ntook her parasol and strolled into the garden. She had slept ill; and\nten minutes in the open air before the family assembled at breakfast\nmight help to compensate her, as she thought, for the loss of her\nnight's rest.\n\nShe wandered to the outermost boundary of the flower-garden, and then\nreturned by another path, which led back, past the side of an ornamental\nsummer-house commanding a view over the fields from a corner of the\nlawn. A slight noise--like, and yet not like, the chirruping of a\nbird--caught her ear as she approached the summer-house. She stepped\nround to the entrance; looked in; and discovered Magdalen and Frank\nseated close together. To Miss Garth's horror, Magdalen's arm was\nunmistakably round Frank's neck; and, worse still, the position of her\nface, at the moment of discovery, showed beyond all doubt that she\nhad just been offering to the victim of Chinese commerce the first and\nforemost of all the consolations which a woman can bestow on a man. In\nplainer words, she had just given Frank a kiss.\n\nIn the presence of such an emergency as now confronted her, Miss Gart h\nfelt instinctively that all ordinary phrases of reproof would be phrases\nthrown away.\n\n\"I presume,\" she remarked, addressing Magdalen with the merciless\nself-possession of a middle-aged lady, unprovided for the occasion with\nany kissing remembrances of her own--\"I presume (whatever excuses your\neffrontery may suggest) you will not deny that my duty compels me to\nmention what I have just seen to your father?\"\n\n\"I will save you the trouble,\" replied Magdalen, composedly. \"I will\nmention it to him myself.\"\n\nWith those words, she looked round at Frank, standing trebly helpless in\na corner of the summer-house. \"You shall hear what happens,\" she said,\nwith her bright smile. \"And so shall you,\" she added for Miss Garth's\nespecial benefit, as she sauntered past the governess on her way back\nto the breakfast-table. The eyes of Miss Garth followed her indignantly;\nand Frank slipped out on his side at that favorable opportunity.\n\nUnder these circumstances, there was but one course that any respectable\nwoman could take--she could only shudder. Miss Garth registered her\nprotest in that form, and returned to the house.\n\nWhen breakfast was over, and when Mr. Vanstone's hand descended to his\npocket in search of his cigar-case, Magdalen rose; looked significantly\nat Miss Garth; and followed her father into the hall.\n\n\"Papa,\" she said, \"I want to speak to you this morning--in private.\"\n\n\"Ay! ay!\" returned Mr. Vanstone. \"What about, my dear!\"\n\n\"About--\" Magdalen hesitated, searching for a satisfactory form of\nexpression, and found it. \"About business, papa,\" she said.\n\nMr. Vanstone took his garden hat from the hall table--opened his eyes\nin mute perplexity--attempted to associate in his mind the two\nextravagantly dissimilar ideas of Magdalen and \"business\"--failed--and\nled the way resignedly into the garden.\n\nHis daughter took his arm, and walked with him to a shady seat at a\nconvenient distance from the house. She dusted the seat with her\nsmart silk apron before her father occupied it. Mr. Vanstone was not\naccustomed to such an extraordinary act of attention as this. He sat\ndown, looking more puzzled than ever. Magdalen immediately placed\nherself on his knee, and rested her head comfortably on his shoulder.\n\n\"Am I heavy, papa?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, you are,\" said Mr. Vanstone--\"but not too heavy for _me_.\nStop on your perch, if you like it. Well? And what may this business\nhappen to be?\"\n\n\"It begins with a question.\"\n\n\"Ah, indeed? That doesn't surprise me. Business with your sex, my dear,\nalways begins with questions. Go on.\"\n\n\"Papa! do you ever intend allowing me to be married?\"\n\nMr. Vanstone's eyes opened wider and wider. The question, to use his own\nphrase, completely staggered him.\n\n\"This is business with a vengeance!\" he said. \"Why, Magdalen! what have\nyou got in that harum-scarum head of yours now?\"\n\n\"I don't exactly know, papa. Will you answer my question?\"\n\n\"I will if I can, my dear; you rather stagger me. Well, I don't know.\nYes; I suppose I must let you be married one of these days--if we can\nfind a good husband for you. How hot your face is! Lift it up, and let\nthe air blow over it. You won't? Well--have your own way. If talking of\nbusiness means tickling your cheek against my whisker I've nothing to\nsay against it. Go on, my dear. What's the next question? Come to the\npoint.\"\n\nShe was far too genuine a woman to do anything of the sort. She\nskirted round the point and calculated her distance to the nicety of a\nhair-breadth.\n\n\"We were all very much surprised yesterday--were we not, papa? Frank is\nwonderfully lucky, isn't he?\"\n\n\"He's the luckiest dog I ever came across,\" said Mr. Vanstone \"But what\nhas that got to do with this business of yours? I dare say you see your\nway, Magdalen. Hang me if I can see mine!\"\n\nShe skirted a little nearer.\n\n\"I suppose he will make his fortune in China?\" she said. \"It's a long\nway off, isn't it? Did you observe, papa, that Frank looked sadly out of\nspirits yesterday?\"\n\n\"I was so surprised by the news,\" said Mr. Vanstone, \"and so staggered\nby the sight of old Clare's sharp nose in my house, that I didn't much\nnotice. Now you remind me of it--yes. I don't think Frank took kindly to\nhis own good luck; not kindly at all.\"\n\n\"Do you wonder at that, papa?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; I do, rather.\"\n\n\"Don't you think it's hard to be sent away for five years, to make your\nfortune among hateful savages, and lose sight of your friends at home\nfor all that long time? Don't you think Frank will miss _us_ sadly?\nDon't you, papa?--don't you?\"\n\n\"Gently, Magdalen! I'm a little too old for those long arms of yours\nto throttle me in fun.--You're right, my love. Nothing in this world\nwithout a drawback. Frank _will_ miss his friends in England: there's no\ndenying that.\"\n\n\"You always liked Frank. And Frank always liked you.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes--a good fellow; a quiet, good fellow. Frank and I have always\ngot on smoothly together.\"\n\n\"You have got on like father and son, haven't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will think it harder on him when he has gone than you think\nit now?\"\n\n\"Likely enough, Magdalen; I don't say no.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will wish he had stopped in England? Why shouldn't he stop\nin England, and do as well as if he went to China?\"\n\n\"My dear! he has no prospects in England. I wish he had, for his own\nsake. I wish the lad well, with all my heart.\"\n\n\"May I wish him well too, papa--with all _my_ heart?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my love--your old playfellow--why not? What's the matter?\nGod bless my soul, what is the girl crying about? One would think Frank\nwas transported for life. You goose! You know, as well as I do, he is\ngoing to China to make his fortune.\"\n\n\"He doesn't want to make his fortune--he might do much better.\"\n\n\"The deuce he might! How, I should like to know?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid to tell you. I'm afraid you'll laugh at me. Will you promise\nnot to laugh at me?\"\n\n\"Anything to please you, my dear. Yes: I promise. Now, then, out with\nit! How might Frank do better?\"\n\n\"He might marry Me.\"\n\nIf the summer scene which then spread before Mr. Vanstone's eyes had\nsuddenly changed to a dreary winter view--if the trees had lost all\ntheir leaves, and the green fields had turned white with snow in an\ninstant--his face could hardly have expressed greater amazement than\nit displayed when his daughter's faltering voice spoke those four\nlast words. He tried to look at her--but she steadily refused him the\nopportunity: she kept her face hidden over his shoulder. Was she in\nearnest? His cheek, still wet with her tears, answered for her. There\nwas a long pause of silence; she waited--with unaccustomed patience, she\nwaited for him to speak. He roused himself, and spoke these words only:\n\"You surprise me, Magdalen; you surprise me more than I can say.\"\n\nAt the altered tone of his voice--altered to a quiet, fatherly\nseriousness--Magdalen's arms clung round him closer than before.\n\n\"Have I disappointed you, papa?\" she asked, faintly. \"Don't say I have\ndisappointed you! Who am I to tell my secret to, if not to you? Don't\nlet him go--don't! don't! You will break his heart. He is afraid to tell\nhis father; he is even afraid _you_ might be angry with him. There is\nnobody to speak for us, except--except me. Oh, don't let him go! Don't\nfor his sake--\" she whispered the next words in a kiss--\"Don't for\nMine!\"\n\nHer father's kind face saddened; he sighed, and patted her fair head\ntenderly. \"Hush, my love,\" he said, almost in a whisper; \"hush!\" She\nlittle knew what a revelation every word, every action that escaped her,\nnow opened before him. She had made him her grown-up playfellow, from\nher childhood to that day. She had romped with him in her frocks, she\nhad gone on romping with him in her gowns. He had never been long enough\nseparated from her to have the external changes in his daughter forced\non his attention. His artless, fatherly experience of her had taught him\nthat she was a taller child in later years--and had taught him little\nmore. And now, in one breathless instant, the conviction that she was a\nwoman rushed over his mind. He felt it in the trouble of her bosom pre\nssed against his; in the nervous thrill of her arms clasped around\nhis neck. The Magdalen of his innocent experience, a woman--with the\nmaster-passion of her sex in possession of her heart already!\n\n\"Have you thought long of this, my dear?\" he asked, as soon as he could\nspeak composedly. \"Are you sure--?\"\n\nShe answered the question before he could finish it.\n\n\"Sure I love him?\" she said. \"Oh, what words can say Yes for me, as I\nwant to say it? I love him--!\" Her voice faltered softly; and her answer\nended in a sigh.\n\n\"You are very young. You and Frank, my love, are both very young.\"\n\nShe raised her head from his shoulder for the first time. The thought\nand its expression flashed from her at the same moment.\n\n\"Are we much younger than you and mamma were?\" she asked, smiling\nthrough her tears.\n\nShe tried to lay her head back in its old position; but as she spoke\nthose words, her father caught her round the waist, forced her, before\nshe was aware of it, to look him in the face--and kissed her, with a\nsudden outburst of tenderness which brought the tears thronging back\nthickly into her eyes. \"Not much younger, my child,\" he said, in low,\nbroken tones--\"not much younger than your mother and I were.\" He put\nher away from him, and rose from the seat, and turned his head aside\nquickly. \"Wait here, and compose yourself; I will go indoors and speak\nto your mother.\" His voice trembled over those parting words; and he\nleft her without once looking round again.\n\nShe waited--waited a weary time; and he never came back. At last her\ngrowing anxiety urged her to follow him into the house. A new timidity\nthrobbed in her heart as she doubtingly approached the door. Never had\nshe seen the depths of her father's simple nature stirred as they had\nbeen stirred by her confession. She almost dreaded her next meeting\nwith him. She wandered softly to and fro in the hall, with a shyness\nunaccountable to herself; with a terror of being discovered and spoken\nto by her sister or Miss Garth, which made her nervously susceptible to\nthe slightest noises in the house. The door of the morning-room opened\nwhile her back was turned toward it. She started violently, as she\nlooked round and saw her father in the hall: her heart beat faster and\nfaster, and she felt herself turning pale. A second look at him, as\nhe came nearer, re-assured her. He was composed again, though not so\ncheerful as usual. She noticed that he advanced and spoke to her with a\nforbearing gentleness, which was more like his manner to her mother than\nhis ordinary manner to herself.\n\n\"Go in, my love,\" he said, opening the door for her which he had just\nclosed. \"Tell your mother all you have told me--and more, if you have\nmore to say. She is better prepared for you than I was. We will take\nto-day to think of it, Magdalen; and to-morrow you shall know, and Frank\nshall know, what we decide.\"\n\nHer eyes brightened, as they looked into his face and saw the decision\nthere already, with the double penetration of her womanhood and her\nlove. Happy, and beautiful in her happiness, she put his hand to her\nlips, and went, without hesitation, into the morning-room. There, her\nfather's words had smoothed the way for her; there, the first shock of\nthe surprise was past and over, and only the pleasure of it remained.\nHer mother had been her age once; her mother would know how fond she\nwas of Frank. So the coming interview was anticipated in her thoughts;\nand--except that there was an unaccountable appearance of restraint in\nMrs. Vanstone's first reception of her--was anticipated aright. After a\nlittle, the mother's questions came more and more unreservedly from the\nsweet, unforgotten experience of the mother's heart. She lived again\nthrough her own young days of hope and love in Magdalen's replies.\n\nThe next morning the all-important decision was announced in words. Mr.\nVanstone took his daughter upstairs into her mother's room, and there\nplaced before her the result of the yesterday's consultation, and of the\nnight's reflection which had followed it. He spoke with perfect kindness\nand self-possession of manner-but in fewer and more serious words than\nusual; and he held his wife's hand tenderly in his own all through the\ninterview.\n\nHe informed Magdalen that neither he nor her mother felt themselves\njustified in blaming her attachment to Frank. It had been in part,\nperhaps, the natural consequence of her childish familiarity with him;\nin part, also, the result of the closer intimacy between them which the\ntheatrical entertainment had necessarily produced. At the same time, it\nwas now the duty of her parents to put that attachment, on both sides,\nto a proper test--for her sake, because her happy future was their\ndearest care; for Frank's sake, because they were bound to give him the\nopportunity of showing himself worthy of the trust confided in him. They\nwere both conscious of being strongly prejudiced in Frank's favor.\nHis father's eccentric conduct had made the lad the object of their\ncompassion and their care from his earliest years. He (and his younger\nbrothers) had almost filled the places to them of those other children\nof their own whom they had lost. Although they firmly believed their\ngood opinion of Frank to be well founded--still, in the interest of\ntheir daughter's happiness, it was necessary to put that opinion firmly\nto the proof, by fixing certain conditions, and by interposing a year of\ndelay between the contemplated marriage and the present time.\n\nDuring that year, Frank was to remain at the office in London; his\nemployers being informed beforehand that family circumstances prevented\nhis accepting their offer of employment in China. He was to consider\nthis concession as a recognition of the attachment between Magdalen and\nhimself, on certain terms only. If, during the year of probation, he\nfailed to justify the confidence placed in him--a confidence which\nhad led Mr. Vanstone to take unreservedly upon himself the whole\nresponsibility of Frank's future prospects--the marriage scheme was to\nbe considered, from that moment, as at an end. If, on the other hand,\nthe result to which Mr. Vanstone confidently looked forward really\noccurred--if Frank's probationary year proved his claim to the most\nprecious trust that could be placed in his hands--then Magdalen herself\nshould reward him with all that a woman can bestow; and the future,\nwhich his present employers had placed before him as the result of a\nfive years' residence in China, should be realized in one year's time,\nby the dowry of his young wife.\n\nAs her father drew that picture of the future, the outburst of\nMagdalen's gratitude could no longer be restrained. She was deeply\ntouched--she spoke from her inmost heart. Mr. Vanstone waited until his\ndaughter and his wife were composed again; and then added the last words\nof explanation which were now left for him to speak.\n\n\"You understand, my love,\" he said, \"that I am not anticipating Frank's\nliving in idleness on his wife's means? My plan for him is that he\nshould still profit by the interest which his present employers take\nin him. Their knowledge of affairs in the City will soon place a good\npartnership at his disposal, and you will give him the money to buy it\nout of hand. I shall limit the sum, my dear, to half your fortune; and\nthe other half I shall have settled upon yourself. We shall all be alive\nand hearty, I hope\"--he looked tenderly at his wife as he said those\nwords--\"all alive and hearty at the year's end. But if I am gone,\nMagdalen, it will make no difference. My will--made long before I ever\nthought of having a son-in-law divides my fortune into two equal parts.\nOne part goes to your mother; and the other part is fairly divided\nbetween my children. You will have your share on your wedding-day (and\nNorah will have hers when she marries) from my own hand, if I live; and\nunder my will if I die. There! there! no gloomy faces,\" he said, with a\nmomentary return of his every-day good spirits. \"Your mother and I mean\nto live and see Frank a great merchant. I shall leave you, my dear,\nto enlighten the son on our new projects, while I walk over to the\ncottage--\"\n\nHe stopped; his eyebrows contra cted a little; and he looked aside\nhesitatingly at Mrs. Vanstone.\n\n\"What must you do at the cottage, papa?\" asked Magdalen, after having\nvainly waited for him to finish the sentence of his own accord.\n\n\"I must consult Frank's father,\" he replied. \"We must not forget that\nMr. Clare's consent is still wanting to settle this matter. And as\ntime presses, and we don't know what difficulties he may not raise, the\nsooner I see him the better.\"\n\nHe gave that answer in low, altered tones; and rose from his chair in\na half-reluctant, half-resigned manner, which Magdalen observed with\nsecret alarm.\n\nShe glanced inquiringly at her mother. To all appearance, Mrs. Vanstone\nhad been alarmed by the change in him also. She looked anxious and\nuneasy; she turned her face away on the sofa pillow--turned it\nsuddenly, as if she was in pain.\n\n\"Are you not well, mamma?\" asked Magdalen.\n\n\"Quite well, my love,\" said Mrs. Vanstone, shortly and sharply, without\nturning round. \"Leave me a little--I only want rest.\"\n\nMagdalen went out with her father.\n\n\"Papa!\" she whispered anxiously, as they descended the stairs; \"you\ndon't think Mr. Clare will say No?\"\n\n\"I can't tell beforehand,\" answered Mr. Vanstone. \"I hope he will say\nYes.\"\n\n\"There is no reason why he should say anything else--is there?\"\n\nShe put the question faintly, while he was getting his hat and stick;\nand he did not appear to hear her. Doubting whether she should repeat\nit or not, she accompanied him as far as the garden, on his way to Mr.\nClare's cottage. He stopped her on the lawn, and sent her back to the\nhouse.\n\n\"You have nothing on your head, my dear,\" he said. \"If you want to be in\nthe garden, don't forget how hot the sun is--don't come out without your\nhat.\"\n\nHe walked on toward the cottage.\n\nShe waited a moment, and looked after him. She missed the customary\nflourish of his stick; she saw his little Scotch terrier, who had run\nout at his heels, barking and capering about him unnoticed. He was out\nof spirits: he was strangely out of spirits. What did it mean?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nON returning to the house, Magdalen felt her shoulder suddenly touched\nfrom behind as she crossed the hall. She turned and confronted her\nsister. Before she could ask any questions, Norah confusedly addressed\nher, in these words: \"I beg your pardon; I beg you to forgive me.\"\n\nMagdalen looked at her sister in astonishment. All memory, on her side,\nof the sharp words which had passed between them in the shrubbery was\nlost in the new interests that now absorbed her; lost as completely\nas if the angry interview had never taken place. \"Forgive you!\" she\nrepeated, amazedly. \"What for?\"\n\n\"I have heard of your new prospects,\" pursued Norah, speaking with a\nmechanical submissiveness of manner which seemed almost ungracious; \"I\nwished to set things right between us; I wished to say I was sorry for\nwhat happened. Will you forget it? Will you forget and forgive what\nhappened in the shrubbery?\" She tried to proceed; but her\ninveterate reserve--or, perhaps, her obstinate reliance on her own\nopinions--silenced her at those last words. Her face clouded over on a\nsudden. Before her sister could answer her, she turned away abruptly and\nran upstairs.\n\nThe door of the library opened, before Magdalen could follow her; and\nMiss Garth advanced to express the sentiments proper to the occasion.\n\nThey were not the mechanically-submissive sentiments which Magdalen had\njust heard. Norah had struggled against her rooted distrust of Frank, in\ndeference to the unanswerable decision of both her parents in his favor;\nand had suppressed the open expression of her antipathy, though the\nfeeling itself remained unconquered. Miss Garth had made no such\nconcession to the master and mistress of the house. She had hitherto\nheld the position of a high authority on all domestic questions; and she\nflatly declined to get off her pedestal in deference to any change in\nthe family circumstances, no matter how amazing or how unexpected that\nchange might be.\n\n\"Pray accept my congratulations,\" said Miss Garth, bristling all\nover with implied objections to Frank--\"my congratulations, _and_\nmy apologies. When I caught you kissing Mr. Francis Clare in the\nsummer-house, I had no idea you were engaged in carrying out the\nintentions of your parents. I offer no opinion on the subject. I merely\nregret my own accidental appearance in the character of an Obstacle to\nthe course of true-love--which appears to run smooth in summer-houses,\nwhatever Shakespeare may say to the contrary. Consider me for the\nfuture, if you please, as an Obstacle removed. May you be happy!\" Miss\nGarth's lips closed on that last sentence like a trap, and Miss Garth's\neyes looked ominously prophetic into the matrimonial future.\n\nIf Magdalen's anxieties had not been far too serious to allow her the\ncustomary free use of her tongue, she would have been ready on the\ninstant with an appropriately satirical answer. As it was, Miss Garth\nsimply irritated her. \"Pooh!\" she said--and ran upstairs to her sister's\nroom.\n\nShe knocked at the door, and there was no answer. She tried the door,\nand it resisted her from the inside. The sullen, unmanageable Norah was\nlocked in.\n\nUnder other circumstances, Magdalen would not have been satisfied with\nknocking--she would have called through the door loudly and more loudly,\ntill the house was disturbed and she had carried her point. But the\ndoubts and fears of the morning had unnerved her already. She went\ndownstairs again softly, and took her hat from the stand in the hall.\n\"He told me to put my hat on,\" she said to herself, with a meek filial\ndocility which was totally out of her character.\n\nShe went into the garden, on the shrubbery side; and waited there to\ncatch the first sight of her father on his return. Half an hour passed;\nforty minutes passed--and then his voice reached her from among the\ndistant trees. \"Come in to heel!\" she heard him call out loudly to the\ndog. Her face turned pale. \"He's angry with Snap!\" she exclaimed to\nherself in a whisper. The next minute he appeared in view; walking\nrapidly, with his head down and Snap at his heels in disgrace. The\nsudden excess of her alarm as she observed those ominous signs\nof something wrong rallied her natural energy, and determined her\ndesperately on knowing the worst. She walked straight forward to meet\nher father.\n\n\"Your face tells your news,\" she said faintly. \"Mr. Clare has been as\nheartless as usual--Mr. Clare has said No?\"\n\nHer father turned on her with a sudden severity, so entirely\nunparalleled in her experience of him that she started back in downright\nterror.\n\n\"Magdalen!\" he said; \"whenever you speak of my old friend and neighbor\nagain, bear this in mind: Mr. Clare has just laid me under an obligation\nwhich I shall remember gratefully to the end of my life.\"\n\nHe stopped suddenly after saying those remarkable words. Seeing that he\nhad startled her, his natural kindness prompted him instantly to\nsoften the reproof, and to end the suspense from which she was plainly\nsuffering. \"Give me a kiss, my love,\" he resumed; \"and I'll tell you in\nreturn that Mr. Clare has said-YES.\"\n\nShe attempted to thank him; but the sudden luxury of relief was too much\nfor her. She could only cling round his neck in silence. He felt her\ntrembling from head to foot, and said a few words to calm her. At\nthe altered tones of his master's voice, Snap's meek tail re-appeared\nfiercely from between his legs; and Snap's lungs modestly tested his\nposition with a brief, experimental bark. The dog's quaintly appropriate\nassertion of himself on his old footing was the interruption of all\nothers which was best fitted to restore Magdalen to herself. She caught\nthe shaggy little terrier up in her arms and kissed _him_ next. \"You\ndarling,\" she exclaimed, \"you're almost as glad as I am!\" She turned\nagain to her father, with a look of tender reproach. \"You frightened me,\npapa,\" she said. \"You were so unlike yourself.\"\n\n\"I shall be right again to-morrow, my dear. I am a little upset to-day.\"\n\n\"Not by me?\"\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"By something you have heard at Mr. Clare's?\"\n\n\"Yes--nothing you need alarm yourself about; nothing that won't wear\noff by to-morrow. Let me go now, my dear; I have a letter to write; and\nI want to speak to your mother.\"\n\nHe left her and went on to the house. Magdalen lingered a little on the\nlawn, to feel all the happiness of her new sensations--then turned away\ntoward the shrubbery to enjoy the higher luxury of communicating them.\nThe dog followed her. She whistled, and clapped her hands. \"Find him!\"\nshe said, with beaming eyes. \"Find Frank!\" Snap scampered into the\nshrubbery, with a bloodthirsty snarl at starting. Perhaps he had\nmistaken his young mistress and considered himself her emissary in\nsearch of a rat?\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Vanstone entered the house. He met his wife slowly\ndescending the stairs, and advanced to give her his arm. \"How has it\nended?\" she asked, anxiously, as he led her to the sofa.\n\n\"Happily--as we hoped it would,\" answered her husband. \"My old friend\nhas justified my opinion of him.\"\n\n\"Thank God!\" said Mrs. Vanstone, fervently. \"Did you feel it, love?\"\nshe asked, as her husband arranged the sofa pillows--\"did you feel it as\npainfully as I feared you would?\"\n\n\"I had a duty to do, my dear--and I did it.\"\n\nAfter replying in those terms, he hesitated. Apparently, he had\nsomething more to say--something, perhaps, on the subject of that\npassing uneasiness of mind which had been produced by his interview\nwith Mr. Clare, and which Magdalen's questions had obliged him to\nacknowledge. A look at his wife decided his doubts in the negative. He\nonly asked if she felt comfortable; and then turned away to leave the\nroom.\n\n\"Must you go?\" she asked.\n\n\"I have a letter to write, my dear.\"\n\n\"Anything about Frank?\"\n\n\"No: to-morrow will do for that. A letter to Mr. Pendril. I want him\nhere immediately.\"\n\n\"Business, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear--business.\"\n\nHe went out, and shut himself into the little front room, close to the\nhall door, which was called his study. By nature and habit the most\nprocrastinating of letter-writers, he now inconsistently opened his desk\nand took up the pen without a moment's delay. His letter was long enough\nto occupy three pages of note-paper; it was written with a readiness\nof expression and a rapidity of hand which seldom characterized his\nproceedings when engaged over his ordinary correspondence. He wrote the\naddress as follows: \"Immediate--William Pendril, Esq., Serle Street,\nLincoln's Inn, London\"--then pushed the letter away from him, and sat\nat the table, drawing lines on the blotting-paper with his pen, lost in\nthought. \"No,\" he said to himself; \"I can do nothing more till Pendril\ncomes.\" He rose; his face brightened as he put the stamp on the\nenvelope. The writing of the letter had sensibly relieved him, and his\nwhole bearing showed it as he left the room.\n\nOn the doorstep he found Norah and Miss Garth, setting forth together\nfor a walk.\n\n\"Which way are you going?\" he asked. \"Anywhere near the post-office? I\nwish you would post this letter for me, Norah. It is very important--so\nimportant that I hardly like to trust it to Thomas, as usual.\"\n\nNorah at once took charge of the letter.\n\n\"If you look, my dear,\" continued her father, \"you will see that I am\nwriting to Mr. Pendril. I expect him here to-morrow afternoon. Will you\ngive the necessary directions, Miss Garth? Mr. Pendril will sleep here\nto-morrow night, and stay over Sunday.--Wait a minute! Today is Friday.\nSurely I had an engagement for Saturday afternoon?\" He consulted his\npocketbook and read over one of the entries, with a look of annoyance.\n\"Grailsea Mill, three o'clock, Saturday. Just the time when Pendril will\nbe here; and I _must_ be at home to see him. How can I manage it? Monday\nwill be too late for my business at Grailsea. I'll go to-day, instead;\nand take my chance of catching the miller at his dinner-time.\" He looked\nat his watch. \"No time for driving; I must do it by railway. If I go\nat once, I shall catch the down train at our station, and get on to\nGrailsea. Take care of the letter, Norah. I won't keep dinner waiting;\nif the return train doesn't suit, I'll borrow a gig and get back in that\nway.\"\n\nAs he took up his hat, Magdalen appeared at the door, returning from her\ninterview with Frank. The hurry of her father's movements attracted her\nattention; and she asked him where he was going.\n\n\"To Grailsea,\" replied Mr. Vanstone. \"Your business, Miss Magdalen, has\ngot in the way of mine--and mine must give way to it.\"\n\nHe spoke those parting words in his old hearty manner; and left them,\nwith the old characteristic flourish of his trusty stick.\n\n\"My business!\" said Magdalen. \"I thought my business was done.\"\n\nMiss Garth pointed significantly to the letter in Norah's hand. \"Your\nbusiness, beyond all doubt,\" she said. \"Mr. Pendril is coming tomorrow;\nand Mr. Vanstone seems remarkably anxious about it. Law, and its\nattendant troubles already! Governesses who look in at summer-house\ndoors are not the only obstacles to the course of true-love. Parchment\nis sometimes an obstacle. I hope you may find Parchment as pliable as I\nam--I wish you well through it. Now, Norah!\"\n\nMiss Garth's second shaft struck as harmless as the first. Magdalen had\nreturned to the house, a little vexed; her interview with Frank having\nbeen interrupted by a messenger from Mr. Clare, sent to summon the son\ninto the father's presence. Although it had been agreed at the private\ninterview between Mr. Vanstone and Mr. Clare that the questions\ndiscussed that morning should not be communicated to the children\nuntil the year of probation was at an end---and although under these\ncircumstances Mr. Clare had nothing to tell Frank which Magdalen could\nnot communicate to him much more agreeably--the philosopher was not the\nless resolved on personally informing his son of the parental concession\nwhich rescued him from Chinese exile. The result was a sudden summons to\nthe cottage, which startled Magdalen, but which did not appear to take\nFrank by surprise. His filial experience penetrated the mystery of Mr.\nClare's motives easily enough. \"When my father's in spirits,\" he said,\nsulkily, \"he likes to bully me about my good luck. This message means\nthat he's going to bully me now.\"\n\n\"Don't go,\" suggested Magdalen.\n\n\"I must,\" rejoined Frank. \"I shall never hear the last of it if I don't.\nHe's primed and loaded, and he means to go off. He went off, once, when\nthe engineer took me; he went off, twice, when the office in the City\ntook me; and he's going off, thrice, now _you've_ taken me. If it wasn't\nfor you, I should wish I had never been born. Yes; your father's been\nkind to me, I know--and I should have gone to China, if it hadn't been\nfor him. I'm sure I'm very much obliged. Of course, we have no right to\nexpect anything else--still it's discouraging to keep us waiting a year,\nisn't it?\"\n\nMagdalen stopped his mouth by a summary process, to which even Frank\nsubmitted gratefully. At the same time, she did not forget to set down\nhis discontent to the right side. \"How fond he is of me!\" she thought.\n\"A year's waiting is quite a hardship to him.\" She returned to the\nhouse, secretly regretting that she had not heard more of Frank's\ncomplimentary complaints. Miss Garth's elaborate satire, addressed to\nher while she was in this frame of mind, was a purely gratuitous waste\nof Miss Garth's breath. What did Magdalen care for satire? What do Youth\nand Love ever care for except themselves? She never even said as much\nas \"Pooh!\" this time. She laid aside her hat in serene silence, and\nsauntered languidly into the morning-room to keep her mother company.\nShe lunched on dire forebodings of a quarrel between Frank and his\nfather, with accidental interruptions in the shape of cold chicken and\ncheese-cakes. She trifled away half an hour at the piano; and played,\nin that time, selections from the Songs of Mendelssohn, the Mazurkas of\nChopin, the Operas of Verdi, and the Sonatas of Mozart--all of whom\nhad combined together on this occasion and produced one immortal work,\nentitled \"Frank.\" She closed the piano and went up to her room, to dream\naway the hours luxuriously in visions of her married future. The green\nshutters were closed, the easy-chair was pushed in front of the glass,\nthe maid was summoned as usual; and the comb assisted the mistress's\nreflections, through the medium of the mistress's hair, till heat and\nidleness asserted their narcotic influences together, and Magdalen fell\nasleep.\n\n\nIt was past three o'clock when she woke. On going downstairs again she\nfound her mother, Norah and Miss Garth all sitting together enjoying the\nshade and the coolness under the open portico in front of the house.\n\nNorah had the railway time-table in her hand. They had been discussing\nthe chances of Mr. Vanstone's catching the return train and getting back\nin good time. That topic had led them, next, to his business errand at\nGrailsea--an errand of kindness, as usual; undertaken for the benefit\nof the miller, who had been his old farm-servant, and who was now hard\npressed by serious pecuniary difficulties. From this they had glided\ninsensibly into a subject often repeated among them, and never exhausted\nby repetition--the praise of Mr. Vanstone himself. Each one of the three\nhad some experience of her own to relate of his simple, generous nature.\nThe conversation seemed to be almost painfully interesting to his\nwife. She was too near the time of her trial now not to feel nervously\nsensitive to the one subject which always held the foremost place in her\nheart. Her eyes overflowed as Magdalen joined the little group under the\nportico; her frail hand trembled as it signed to her youngest daughter\nto take the vacant chair by her side. \"We were talking of your father,\"\nshe said, softly. \"Oh, my love, if your married life is only as happy--\"\nHer voice failed her; she put her handkerchief hurriedly over her face\nand rested her head on Magdalen's shoulder. Norah looked appealingly to\nMiss Garth, who at once led the conversation back to the more trivial\nsubject of Mr. Vanstone's return. \"We have all been wondering,\" she\nsaid, with a significant look at Magdalen, \"whether your father will\nleave Grailsea in time to catch the train--or whether he will miss it\nand be obliged to drive back. What do you say?\"\n\n\"I say, papa will miss the train,\" replied Magdalen, taking Miss Garth's\nhint with her customary quickness. \"The last thing he attends to at\nGrailsea will be the business that brings him there. Whenever he has\nbusiness to do, he always puts it off to the last moment, doesn't he,\nmamma?\"\n\nThe question roused her mother exactly as Magdalen had intended it\nshould. \"Not when his errand is an errand of kindness,\" said\nMrs. Vanstone. \"He has gone to help the miller in a very pressing\ndifficulty--\"\n\n\"And don't you know what he'll do?\" persisted Magdalen. \"He'll romp with\nthe miller's children, and gossip with the mother, and hob-and-nob with\nthe father. At the last moment when he has got five minutes left to\ncatch the train, he'll say: 'Let's go into the counting-house and\nlook at the books.' He'll find the books dreadfully complicated; he'll\nsuggest sending for an accountant; he'll settle the business off hand,\nby lending the money in the meantime; he'll jog back comfortably in the\nmiller's gig; and he'll tell us all how pleasant the lanes were in the\ncool of the evening.\"\n\nThe little character-sketch which these words drew was too faithful a\nlikeness not to be recognized. Mrs. Vanstone showed her appreciation of\nit by a smile. \"When your father returns,\" she said, \"we will put your\naccount of his proceedings to the test. I think,\" she continued, rising\nlanguidly from her chair, \"I had better go indoors again now and rest on\nthe sofa till he comes back.\"\n\nThe little group under the portico broke up. Magdalen slipped away into\nthe garden to hear Frank's account of the interview with his father. The\nother three ladies entered the house together. When Mrs. Vanstone was\ncomfortably established on the sofa, Norah and Miss Garth left her to\nrepose, and withdrew to the library to look over the last parcel of\nbooks from London.\n\nIt was a quiet, cloudless summer's day. The heat was tempered by a light\nwestern breeze; the voices of laborers at work in a field near reached\nthe house cheerfully; the clock-bell of the village church as it struck\nthe quarters floated down the wind with a clearer ring, a louder melody\nthan usual. Sweet odors from field and flower-garden, stealing in at the\nopen windows, filled the house with their fragrance; and the birds in\nNorah's aviary upstairs sang the song of their happiness exultingly in\nthe sun.\n\nAs the church clock struck the quarter past four, the morning-room door\nopened; and Mrs. Vanstone crossed the hall alone. She had tried vainly\nto compose herself. She was too restless to lie still and sleep. For\na moment she directed her steps toward the portico--then turned, and\nlooked about her, doubtful where to go, or what to do next. While\nshe was still hesitating, the half-open door of her husband's study\nattracted her attention. The room seemed to be in sad confusion. Drawers\nwere left open; coats and hats, account-books and papers, pipes and\nfishing-rods were all scattered about together. She went in, and pushed\nthe door to--but so gently that she still left it ajar. \"It will amuse\nme to put his room to rights,\" she thought to herself. \"I should like to\ndo something for him before I am down on my bed, helpless.\" She began\nto arrange his drawers, and found his banker's book lying open in one\nof them. \"My poor dear, how careless he is! The servants might have seen\nall his affairs, if I had not happened to have looked in.\" She set\nthe drawers right; and then turned to the multifarious litter on\na side-table. A little old-fashioned music-book appeared among the\nscattered papers, with her name written in it, in faded ink. She blushed\nlike a young girl in the first happiness of the discovery. \"How good\nhe is to me! He remembers my poor old music-book, and keeps it for my\nsake.\" As she sat down by the table and opened the book, the bygone time\ncame back to her in all its tenderness. The clock struck the half-hour,\nstruck the three-quarters--and still she sat there, with the music-book\non her lap, dreaming happily over the old songs; thinking gratefully\nof the golden days when his hand had turned the pages for her, when his\nvoice had whispered the words which no woman's memory ever forgets.\n\n\nNorah roused herself from the volume she was reading, and glanced at the\nclock on the library mantel-piece.\n\n\"If papa comes back by the railway,\" she said, \"he will be here in ten\nminutes.\"\n\nMiss Garth started, and looked up drowsily from the book which was just\ndropping out of her hand.\n\n\"I don't think he will come by train,\" she replied. \"He will jog\nback--as Magdalen flippantly expressed it--in the miller's gig.\"\n\nAs she said the words, there was a knock at the library door. The\nfootman appeared, and addressed himself to Miss Garth.\n\n\"A person wishes to see you, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know, ma'am. A stranger to me--a respectable-looking man--and\nhe said he particularly wished to see you.\"\n\nMiss Garth went out into the hall. The footman closed the library door\nafter her, and withdrew down the kitchen stairs.\n\nThe man stood just inside the door, on the mat. His eyes wandered, his\nface was pale--he looked ill; he looked frightened. He trifled nervously\nwith his cap, and shifted it backward and forward, from one hand to the\nother.\n\n\"You wanted to see me?\" said Miss Garth.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am.--You are not Mrs. Vanstone, are you?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I am Miss Garth. Why do you ask the question?\"\n\n\"I am employed in the clerk's office at Grailsea Station--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I am sent here--\"\n\nHe stopped again. His wandering eyes looked down at the mat, and his\nrestless hands wrung his cap harder and harder. He moistened his dry\nlips, and tried once more.\n\n\"I am sent here on a very serious errand.\"\n\n\"Serious to _me_?\"\n\n\"Serious to all in this house.\"\n\nMiss Garth took one step nearer to him--took one steady look at his\nface. She turned cold in the summer heat. \"Stop!\" she said, with\na sudden distrust, and glanced aside anxiously at the door of the\nmorning-room. It was safely closed. \"Tell me the worst; and don't speak\nloud. There has been an accident. Where?\"\n\n\"On the railway. Close to Grailsea Station.\"\n\n\"The up-train to London?\"\n\n\"No: the down-train at one-fifty--\"\n\n\"God Almighty help us! The train Mr. Vanstone traveled by to Grailsea?\"\n\n\"The same. I was sent here by the up-train; the line was just cleared in\ntime for it. They wouldn't write--they said I must see 'Miss Garth,' and\ntell her. There are seven passengers badly hurt; and two--\"\n\nThe next word failed on his lips; he raised his hand in the dead\nsilence. With eyes that opened wide in horror, he raised his hand and\npointed over Miss Garth's shoulder.\n\nShe turned a little, and looked back.\n\nFace to face with her, on the threshold of the study door, stood\nthe mistress of the house. She held her old music-book clutched fast\nmechanically in both hands. She stood, the specter of herself. With a\ndreadful vacancy in her eyes, with a dreadful stillness in her voice,\nshe repeated the man's last words:\n\n\"Seven passengers badly hurt; and two--\"\n\nHer tortured fingers relaxed their hold; the book dropped from them; she\nsank forward heavily. Miss Garth caught her before she fell--caught her,\nand turned upon the man, with the wife's swooning body in her arms, to\nhear the husband's fate.\n\n\"The harm is done,\" she said; \"you may speak out. Is he wounded, or\ndead?\"\n\n\"Dead.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE sun sank lower; the western breeze floated cool and fresh into the\nhouse. As the evening advanced, the cheerful ring of the village clock\ncame nearer and nearer. Field and flower-garden felt the influence of\nthe hour, and shed their sweetest fragrance. The birds in Norah's aviary\nsunned themselves in the evening stillness, and sang their farewell\ngratitude to the dying day.\n\nStaggered in its progress for a time only, the pitiless routine of the\nhouse went horribly on its daily way. The panic-stricken servants took\ntheir blind refuge in the duties proper to the hour. The footman softly\nlaid the table for dinner. The maid sat waiting in senseless doubt, with\nthe hot-water jugs for the bedrooms ranged near her in their customary\nrow. The gardener, who had been ordered to come to his master, with\nvouchers for money that he had paid in excess of his instructions, said\nhis character was dear to him, and left the vouchers at his appointed\ntime. Custom that never yields, and Death that never spares, met on the\nwreck of human happiness--and Death gave way.\n\nHeavily the thunder-clouds of Affliction had gathered over the\nhouse--heavily, but not at their darkest yet. At five, that evening,\nthe shock of the calamity had struck its blow. Before another hour had\npassed, the disclosure of the husband's sudden death was followed by\nthe suspense of the wife's mortal peril. She lay helpless on her widowed\nbed; her own life, and the life of her unborn child, trembling in the\nbalance.\n\nBut one mind still held possession of its resources--but one guiding\nspirit now moved helpfully in the house of mourning.\n\nIf Miss Garth's early days had been passed as calmly and as happily\nas her later life at Combe-Raven, she might have sunk under the cruel\nnecessities of the time. But the governess's youth had been tried in the\nordeal of family affliction; and she met her terrible duties with the\nsteady courage of a woman who had learned to suffer. Alone, she had\nfaced the trial of telling the daughters that they were fatherless.\nAlone, she now struggled to sustain them, when the dreadful certainty of\ntheir bereavement was at last impressed on their minds.\n\nHer least anxiety was for the elder sister. The agony of Norah's grief\nhad forced its way outward to the natural relief of tears. It was not\nso with Magdalen. Tearless and speechless, she sat in the room where\nthe revelation of her father's death had first reached her; her face,\nunnaturally petrified by the sterile sorrow of old age--a white,\nchangeless blank, fearful to look at. Nothing roused, nothing melted\nher. She only said, \"Don't speak to me; don't touch me. Let me bear\nit by myself\"--and fell silent again. The first great grief which had\ndarkened the sisters' lives had, as it seemed, changed their everyday\ncharacters already.\n\nThe twilight fell, and faded; and the summer night came brightly. As\nthe first carefully shaded light was kindled in the sick-room, the\nphysician, who had been summoned from Bristol, arrived to consult with\nthe medical attendant of the family. He could give no comfort: he could\nonly say, \"We must try, and hope. The shock which struck her, when she\noverheard the news of her husband's death, has prostrated her strength\nat the time when she needed it most. No effort to preserve her shall be\nneglected. I will stay here for the night.\"\n\nHe opened one of the windows to admit more air as he spoke. The view\noverlooked the drive in front of the house and the road outside. Little\ngroups of people were standing before the lodge-gates, looking in. \"If\nthose persons make any noise,\" said the doctor, \"they must be warned\naway.\" There was no need to warn them: they were only the laborers who\nhad worked on the dead man's property, and here and there some women and\nchildren from the village. They were all thinking of him--some talking\nof him--and it quickened their sluggish minds to look at his house.\nThe gentlefolks thereabouts were mostly kind to them (the men said),\nbut none like _him_. The women whispered to each other of his comforting\nways when he came into their cottages. \"He was a cheerful man, poor\nsoul; and thoughtful of us, too: he never came in and stared at\nmeal-times; the rest of 'em help us, and scold us--all _he_ ever said\nwas, better luck next time.\" So they stood and talked of him, and looked\nat his house and grounds and moved off clumsily by twos and threes, with\nthe dim sense that the sight of his pleasant face would never comfort\nthem again. The dullest head among them knew, that night, that the hard\nways of poverty would be all the harder to walk on, now he was gone.\n\nA little later, news was brought to the bed-chamber door that old Mr.\nClare had come alone to the house, and was waiting in the hall below, to\nhear what the physician said. Miss Garth was not able to go down to him\nherself: she sent a message. He said to the servant, \"I'll come and ask\nagain, in two hours' time\"--and went out slowly. Unlike other men in\nall things else, the sudden death of his old friend had produced no\ndiscernible change in him. The feeling implied in the errand of inquiry\nthat had brought him to the house was the one betrayal of human sympathy\nwhich escaped the rugged, impenetrable old man.\n\nHe came again, when the two hours had expired; and this time Miss Garth\nsaw him.\n\nThey shook hands in silence. She waited; she nerved herself to hear him\nspeak of his lost friend. No: he never mentioned the dreadful accident,\nhe never alluded to the dreadful death. He said these words, \"Is she\nbetter, or worse?\" and said no more. Was the tribute of his grief for\nthe husband sternly suppressed under the expression of his anxiety for\nthe wife? The nature of the man, unpliably antagonistic to the world\nand the world's customs, might justify some such interpretation of his\nconduct as this. He repeated his question, \"Is she better, or worse?\"\n\nMiss Garth answered him:\n\n\"No better; if there is any change, it is a change for the worse.\"\n\nThey spoke those words at the window of the morning-room which opened\non the garden. Mr. Clare paused, after hearing the reply to his inquiry,\nstepped out on to the walk, then turned on a sudden, and spoke again:\n\n\"Has the doctor given her up?\" he asked.\n\n\"He has not concealed from us that she is in danger. We can only pray\nfor her.\"\n\nThe old man laid his hand on Miss Garth's arm as she answered him, and\nlooked her attentively in the face.\n\n\"You believe in prayer?\" he said.\n\nMiss Garth drew sorrowfully back from him.\n\n\"You might have spared me that question sir, at such a time as this.\"\n\nHe took no notice of her answer; his eyes were still fastened on her\nface.\n\n\"Pray!\" he said. \"Pray as you never prayed before, for the preservation\nof Mrs. Vanstone's life.\"\n\nHe left her. His voice and manner implied some unutterable dread of the\nfuture, which his words had not confessed. Miss Garth followed him into\nthe garden, and called to him. He heard her, but he never turned back:\nhe quickened his pace, as if he desired to avoid her. She watched\nhim across the lawn in the warm summer moonlight. She saw his white,\nwithered hands, saw them suddenly against the black background of the\nshrubbery, raised and wrung above his head. They dropped--the trees\nshrouded him in darkness--he was gone.\n\nMiss Garth went back to the suffering woman, with the burden on her mind\nof one anxiety more.\n\nIt was then past eleven o'clock. Some little time had elapsed since she\nhad seen the sisters and spoken to them. The inquiries she addressed to\none of the female servants only elicited the information that they were\nboth in their rooms. She delayed her return to the mother's bedside to\nsay her parting words of comfort to the daughters, before she left them\nfor the night. Norah's room was the nearest. She softly opened the door\nand looked in. The kneeling figure by the bedside told her that God's\nhelp had found the fatherless daughter in her affliction. Grateful tears\ngathered in her eyes as she looked: she softly closed the door, and went\non to Magdalen's room. There doubt stayed her feet at the threshold, and\nshe waited for a moment before going in.\n\nA sound in the room caught her ear--the monotonous rustling of a woman's\ndress, now distant, now near; passing without cessation from end to end\nover the floor--a sound which told her that Magdalen was pacing to and\nfro in the secrecy of her own chamber. Miss Garth knocked. The rustling\nceased; the door was opened, and the sad young face confronted her,\nlocked in its cold despair; the large light eyes looked mechanically\ninto hers, as vacant and as tearless as ever.\n\nThat look wrung the heart of the faithful woman, who had trained her and\nloved her from a child. She took Magdalen tenderly in her arms.\n\n\"Oh, my love,\" she said, \"no tears yet! Oh, if I could see you as I have\nseen Norah! Speak to me, Magdalen--try if you can speak to me.\"\n\nShe tried, and spoke:\n\n\"Norah,\" she said, \"feels no remorse. He was not serving Norah's\ninterests when he went to his death: he was serving mine.\"\n\nWith that terrible answer, she put her cold lips to Miss Garth's cheek.\n\n\"Let me bear it by myself,\" she said, and gently closed the door.\n\nAgain Miss Garth waited at the threshold, and again the sound of the\nrustling dress passed to and fro--now far, now near--to and fro with\na cruel, mechanical regularity, that chilled the warmest sympathy, and\ndaunted the boldest hope.\n\nThe night passed. It had been agreed, if no change for the better showed\nitself by the morning, that the London physician whom Mrs. Vanstone had\nconsulted some months since should be summoned to the house on the next\nday. No change for the better appeared, and the physician was sent for.\n\nAs the morning advanced, Frank came to make inquiries from the cottage.\nHad Mr. Clare intrusted to his son the duty which he had personally\nperformed on the previous day through reluctance to meet Miss Garth\nagain after what he had said to her? It might be so. Frank could throw\nno light on the subject; he was not in his father's confidence. He\nlooked pale and bewildered. His first inquiries after Magdalen showed\nhow his weak nature had been shaken by the catastrophe. He was not\ncapable of framing his own questions: the words faltered on his lips,\nand the ready tears came into his eyes. Miss Garth's heart warmed to him\nfor the first time. Grief has this that is noble in it--it accepts\nall sympathy, come whence it may. She encouraged the lad by a few kind\nwords, and took his hand at parting.\n\nBefore noon Frank returned with a second message. His father desired to\nknow whether Mr. Pendril was not expected at Combe-Raven on that day.\nIf the lawyer's arrival was looked for, Frank was directed to be in\nattendance at the station, and to take him to the cottage, where a\nbed would be placed at his disposal. This message took Miss Garth by\nsurprise. It showed that Mr. Clare had been made acquainted with his\ndead friend's purpose of sending for Mr. Pendril. Was the old man's\nthoughtful offer of hospitality another indirect expression of the\nnatural human distress which he perversely concealed? or was he aware of\nsome secret necessity for Mr. Pendril's presence, of which the bereaved\nfamily had been kept in total ignorance? Miss Garth was too heart-sick\nand hopeless to dwell on either question. She told Frank that Mr.\nPendril had been expected at three o'clock, and sent him back with her\nthanks.\n\nShortly after his departure, such anxieties on Magdalen's account as\nher mind was now able to feel were relieved by better news than her last\nnight's experience had inclined her to hope for. Norah's influence had\nbeen exerted to rouse her sister; and Norah's patient sympathy had\nset the prisoned grief free. Magdalen had suffered severely--suffered\ninevitably, with such a nature as hers--in the effort that relieved her.\nThe healing tears had not come gently; they had burst from her with a\ntorturing, passionate vehemence--but Norah had never left her till\nthe struggle was over, and the calm had come. These better tidings\nencouraged Miss Garth to withdraw to her own room, and to take the rest\nwhich she needed sorely. Worn out in body and mind, she slept from sheer\nexhaustion--slept heavily and dreamless for some hours. It was between\nthree and four in the afternoon when she was roused by one of the female\nservants. The woman had a note in her hand--a note left by Mr. Clare\nthe younger, with a message desiring that it might be delivered to Miss\nGarth immediately. The name written in the lower corner of the envelope\nwas \"William Pendril.\" The lawyer had arrived.\n\nMiss Garth opened the note. After a few first sentences of sympathy and\ncondolence, the writer announced his arrival at Mr. Clare's; and then\nproceeded, apparently in his professional capacity, to make a very\nstartling request.\n\n\"If,\" he wrote, \"any change for the better in Mrs. Vanstone should take\nplace--whether it is only an improvement for the time, or whether it\nis the permanent improvement for which we all hope--in either case\nI entreat you to let me know of it immediately. It is of the last\nimportance that I should see her, in the event of her gaining strength\nenough to give me her attention for five minutes, and of her being able\nat the expiration of that time to sign her name. May I beg that you will\ncommunicate my request, in the strictest confidence, to the medical men\nin attendance? They will understand, and you will understand, the\nvital importance I attach to this interview when I tell you that I have\narranged to defer to it all other business claims on me; and that I\nhold myself in readiness to obey your summons at any hour of the day or\nnight.\"\n\nIn those terms the letter ended. Miss Garth read it twice over. At the\nsecond reading the request which the lawyer now addressed to her, and\nthe farewell words which had escaped Mr. Clare's lips the day before,\nconnected themselves vaguely in her mind. There was some other serious\ninterest in suspense, known to Mr. Pendril and known to Mr. Clare,\nbesides the first and foremost interest of Mrs. Vanstone's recovery.\nWhom did it affect? The children? Were they threatened by some new\ncalamity which their mother's signature might avert? What did it mean?\nDid it mean that Mr. Vanstone had died without leaving a will?\n\nIn her distress and confusion of mind Miss Garth was incapable of\nreasoning with herself, as she might have reasoned at a happier time.\nShe hastened to the antechamber of Mrs. Vanstone's room; and, after\nexplaining Mr. Pendril's position toward the family, placed his letter\nin the hands of the medical men. They both answered, without hesitation,\nto the same purpose. Mrs. Vanstone's condition rendered any such\ninterview as the lawyer desired a total impossibility. If she rallied\nfrom her present prostration, Miss Garth should be at once informed of\nthe improvement. In the meantime, the answer to Mr. Pendril might be\nconveyed in one word--Impossible.\n\n\"You see what importance Mr. Pendril attaches to the interview?\" said\nMiss Garth.\n\nYes: both the doctors saw it.\n\n\"My mind is lost and confused, gentlemen, in this dreadful suspense.\nCan you either of you guess why the signature is wanted? or what the\nobject of the interview may be? I have only seen Mr. Pendril when he has\ncome here on former visits: I have no claim to justify me in questioning\nhim. Will you look at the letter again? Do you think it implies that Mr.\nVanstone has never made a will?\"\n\n\"I think it can hardly imply that,\" said one of the doctors. \"But, even\nsupposing Mr. Vanstone to have died intestate, the law takes due care of\nthe interests of his widow and his children--\"\n\n\"Would it do so,\" interposed the other medical man, \"if the property\nhappened to be in land?\"\n\n\"I am not sure in that case. Do you happen to know, Miss Garth, whether\nMr. Vanstone's property was in money or in land?\"\n\n\"In money,\" replied Miss Garth. \"I have heard him say so on more than\none occasion.\"\n\n\"Then I can relieve your mind by speaking from my own experience. The\nlaw, if he has died intestate, gives a third of his property to his\nwidow, and divides the rest equally among his children.\"\n\n\"But if Mrs. Vanstone--\"\n\n\"If Mrs. Vanstone should die,\" pursued the doctor, completing the\nquestion which Miss Garth had not the heart to conclude for herself, \"I\nbelieve I am right in telling you that the property would, as a matter\nof legal course, go to the children. Whatever necessity there may be\nfor the interview which Mr. Pendril requests, I can see no reason for\nconnecting it with the question of Mr. Vanstone's presumed intestacy.\nBut, by all means, put the question, for the satisfaction of your own\nmind, to Mr. Pendril himself.\"\n\nMiss Garth withdrew to take the course which the doctor advised. After\ncommunicating to Mr. Pendril the medical decision which, thus far,\nrefused him the interview that he sought, she added a brief statement of\nthe legal question she had put to the doctors; and hinted delicately\nat her natural anxiety to be informed of the motives which had led the\nlawyer to make his request. The answer she received was guarded in the\nextreme: it did not impress her with a favorable opinion of Mr. Pendril.\nHe confirmed the doctors' interpretation of the law in general terms\nonly; expressed his intention of waiting at the cottage in the hope that\na change for the better might yet enable Mrs. Vanstone to see him; and\nclosed his letter without the slightest explanation of his motives, and\nwithout a word of reference to the question of the existence, or the\nnon-existence, of Mr. Vanstone's will.\n\nThe marked caution of the lawyer's reply dwelt uneasily on Miss Garth's\nmind, until the long-expected event of the day recalled all her thoughts\nto her one absorbing anxiety on Mrs. Vanstone's account.\n\nEarly in the evening the physician from London arrived. He watched\nlong by the bedside of the suffering woman; he remained longer still\nin consultation with his medical brethren; he went back again to the\nsick-room, before Miss Garth could prevail on him to communicate to her\nthe opinion at which he had arrived.\n\nWhen he called out into the antechamber for the second time, he silently\ntook a chair by her side. She looked in his face; and the last faint\nhope died in her before he opened his lips.\n\n\"I must speak the hard truth,\" he said, gently. \"All that _can_ be done\n_has_ been done. The next four-and-twenty hours, at most, will end\nyour suspense. If Nature makes no effort in that time--I grieve to say\nit--you must prepare yourself for the worst.\"\n\nThose words said all: they were prophetic of the end.\n\nThe night passed; and she lived through it. The next day came; and she\nlingered on till the clock pointed to five. At that hour the tidings of\nher husband's death had dealt the mortal blow. When the hour came round\nagain, the mercy of God let her go to him in the better world. Her\ndaughters were kneeling at the bedside as her spirit passed away.\nShe left them unconscious of their presence; mercifully and happily\ninsensible to the pang of the last farewell.\n\nHer child survived her till the evening was on the wane and the sunset\nwas dim in the quiet western heaven. As the darkness came, the light of\nthe frail little life--faint and feeble from the first--flickered and\nwent out. All that was earthly of mother and child lay, that night, on\nthe same bed. The Angel of Death had done his awful bidding; and the two\nSisters were left alone in the world.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nEARLIER than usual on the morning of Thursday, the twenty-third of July,\nMr. Clare appeared at the door of his cottage, and stepped out into the\nlittle strip of garden attached to his residence.\n\nAfter he had taken a few turns backward and forward, alone, he was\njoined by a spare, quiet, gray-haired man, whose personal appearance was\ntotally devoid of marked character of any kind; whose inexpressive\nface and conventionally-quiet manner presented nothing that attracted\napproval and nothing that inspired dislike. This was Mr. Pendril--this\nwas the man on whose lips hung the future of the orphans at Combe-Raven.\n\n\"The time is getting on,\" he said, looking toward the shrubbery, as he\njoined Mr. Clare.\n\n\"My appointment with Miss Garth is for eleven o'clock: it only wants ten\nminutes of the hour.\"\n\n\"Are you to see her alone?\" asked Mr. Clare.\n\n\"I left Miss Garth to decide--after warning her, first of all, that the\ncircumstances I am compelled to disclose are of a very serious nature.\"\n\n\"And _has_ she decided?\"\n\n\"She writes me word that she mentioned my appointment, and repeated\nthe warning I had given her to both the daughters. The elder of the two\nshrinks--and who can wonder at it?--from any discussion connected with\nthe future which requires her presence so soon as the day after the\nfuneral. The younger one appears to have expressed no opinion on the\nsubject. As I understand it, she suffers herself to be passively guided\nby her sister's example. My interview, therefore, will take place with\nMiss Garth alone--and it is a very great relief to me to know it.\"\n\nHe spoke the last words with more emphasis and energy than seemed\nhabitual to him. Mr. Clare stopped, and looked at his guest attentively.\n\n\"You are almost as old as I am, sir,\" he said. \"Has all your long\nexperience as a lawyer not hardened you yet?\"\n\n\"I never knew how little it had hardened me,\" replied Mr. Pendril,\nquietly, \"until I returned from London yesterday to attend the funeral.\nI was not warned that the daughters had resolved on following their\nparents to the grave. I think their presence made the closing scene of\nthis dreadful calamity doubly painful, and doubly touching. You saw\nhow the great concourse of people were moved by it--and _they_ were in\nignorance of the truth; _they_ knew nothing of the cruel necessity which\ntakes me to the house this morning. The sense of that necessity--and the\nsight of those poor girls at the time when I felt my hard duty toward\nthem most painfully--shook me, as a man of my years and my way of life\nis not often shaken by any distress in the present or any suspense in\nthe future. I have not recovered it this morning: I hardly feel sure of\nmyself yet.\"\n\n\"A man's composure--when he is a man like you--comes with the necessity\nfor it,\" said Mr. Clare. \"You must have had duties to perform as trying\nin their way as the duty that lies before you this morning.\"\n\nMr. Pendril shook his head. \"Many duties as serious; many stories more\nromantic. No duty so trying, no story so hopeless, as this.\"\n\nWith those words they parted. Mr. Pendril left the garden for the\nshrubbery path which led to Combe-Raven. Mr. Clare returned to the\ncottage.\n\nOn reaching the passage, he looked through the open door of his little\nparlor and saw Frank sitting there in idle wretchedness, with his head\nresting wearily on his hand.\n\n\"I have had an answer from your employers in London,\" said Mr. Clare.\n\"In consideration of what has happened, they will allow the offer they\nmade you to stand over for another month.\"\n\nFrank changed color, and rose nervously from his chair.\n\n\"Are my prospects altered?\" he asked. \"Are Mr. Vanstone's plans for me\nnot to be carried out? He told Magdalen his will had provided for her.\nShe repeated his words to me; she said I ought to know all that his\ngoodness and generosity had done for both of us. How can his death make\na change? Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"Wait till Mr. Pendril comes back from Combe-Raven,\" said his father.\n\"Question him--don't question me.\"\n\nThe ready tears rose in Frank's eyes.\n\n\"You won't be hard on me?\" he pleaded, faintly. \"You won't expect me to\ngo back to London without seeing Magdalen first?\"\n\nMr. Clare looked thoughtfully at his son, and considered a little before\nhe replied.\n\n\"You may dry your eyes,\" he said. \"You shall see Magdalen before you go\nback.\"\n\nHe left the room, after making that reply, and withdrew to his study.\nThe books lay ready to his hand as usual. He opened one of them and set\nhimself to read in the customary manner. But his attention wandered;\nand his eyes strayed away, from time to time, to the empty chair\nopposite--the chair in which his old friend and gossip had sat and\nwrangled with him good-humoredly for many and many a year past. After a\nstruggle with himself he closed the book. \"D--n the chair!\" he said: \"it\n_will_ talk of him; and I must listen.\" He reached down his pipe from\nthe wall and mechanically filled it with tobacco. His hand shook, his\neyes wandered back to the old place; and a heavy sigh came from him\nunwillingly. That empty chair was the only earthly argument for which\nhe had no answer: his heart owned its defeat and moistened his eyes in\nspite of him. \"He has got the better of me at last,\" said the rugged old\nman. \"There is one weak place left in me still--and _he_ has found it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Pendril entered the shrubbery, and followed the path\nwhich led to the lonely garden and the desolate house. He was met at the\ndoor by the man-servant, who was apparently waiting in expectation of\nhis arrival.\n\n\"I have an appointment with Miss Garth. Is she ready to see me?\"\n\n\"Quite ready, sir.\"\n\n\"Is she alone?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"In the room which was Mr. Vanstone's study?\"\n\n\"In that room, sir.\"\n\nThe servant opened the door and Mr. Pendril went in.\n\nThe governess stood alone at the study window. The morning was\noppressively hot, and she threw up the lower sash to admit more air into\nthe room, as Mr. Pendril entered it.\n\nThey bowed to each other with a formal politeness, which betrayed on\neither side an uneasy sense of restraint. Mr. Pendril was one of the\nmany men who appear superficially to the worst advantage, under the\ninfluence of strong mental agitation which it is necessary for them to\ncontrol. Miss Garth, on her side, had not forgotten the ungraciously\nguarded terms in which the lawyer had replied to her letter; and the\nnatural anxiety which she had felt on the subject of the interview was\nnot relieved by any favorable opinion of the man who sought it. As\nthey confronted each other in the silence of the summer's morning--both\ndressed in black; Miss Garth's hard features, gaunt and haggard with\ngrief; the lawyer's cold, colorless face, void of all marked expression,\nsuggestive of a business embarrassment and of nothing more--it would\nhave been hard to find two persons less attractive externally to any\nordinary sympathies than the two who had now met together, the one to\ntell, the other to hear, the secrets of the dead.\n\n\"I am sincerely sorry, Miss Garth, to intrude on you at such a time as\nthis. But circumstances, as I have already explained, leave me no other\nchoice.\"\n\n\"Will you take a seat, Mr. Pendril? You wished to see me in this room, I\nbelieve?\"\n\n\"Only in this room, because Mr. Vanstone's papers are kept here, and I\nmay find it necessary to refer to some of them.\"\n\nAfter that formal interchange of question and answer, they sat down\non either side of a table placed close under the window. One waited\nto speak, the other waited to hear. There was a momentary silence. Mr.\nPendril broke it by referring to the young ladies, with the customary\nexpressions of sympathy. Miss Garth answered him with the same ceremony,\nin the same conventional tone. There was a second pause of silence. The\nhumming of flies among the evergreen shrubs under the window penetrated\ndrowsily into the room; and the tramp of a heavy-footed cart-horse,\nplodding along the high-road beyond the garden, was as plainly audible\nin the stillness as if it had been night.\n\nThe lawyer roused his flagging resolution, and spoke to the purpose when\nhe spoke next.\n\n\"You have some reason, Miss Garth,\" he began, \"to feel not quite\nsatisfied with my past conduct toward you, in one particular. During\nMrs. Vanstone's fatal illness, you addressed a letter to me, making\ncertain inquiries; which, while she lived, it was impossible for me to\nanswer. Her deplorable death releases me from the restraint which I had\nimposed on myself, and permits--or, more properly, obliges me to speak.\nYou shall know what serious reasons I had for waiting day and night in\nthe hope of obtaining that interview which unhappily never took place;\nand in justice to Mr. Vanstone's memory, your own eyes shall inform you\nthat he made his will.\"\n\nHe rose; unlocked a little iron safe in the corner of the room; and\nreturned to the table with some folded sheets of paper, which he spread\nopen under Miss Garth's eyes. When she had read the first words, \"In the\nname of God, Amen,\" he turned the sheet, and pointed to the end of the\nnext page. She saw the well-known signature: \"Andrew Vanstone.\" She saw\nthe customary attestations of the two witnesses; and the date of the\ndocument, reverting to a period of more than five years since. Having\nthus convinced her of the formality of the will, the lawyer interposed\nbefore she could question him, and addressed her in these words:\n\n\"I must not deceive you,\" he said. \"I have my own reasons for producing\nthis document.\"\n\n\"What reasons, sir?\"\n\n\"You shall hear them. When you are in possession of the truth, these\npages may help to preserve your respect for Mr. Vanstone's memory--\"\n\nMiss Garth started back in her chair.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked, with a stern straightforwardness.\n\nHe took no heed of the question; he went on as if she had not\ninterrupted him.\n\n\"I have a second reason,\" he continued, \"for showing you the will. If\nI can prevail on you to read certain clauses in it, under my\nsuperintendence, you will make your own discovery of the circumstances\nwhich I am here to disclose--circumstances so painful that I hardly know\nhow to communicate them to you with my own lips.\"\n\nMiss Garth looked him steadfastly in the face.\n\n\"Circumstances, sir, which affect the dead parents, or the living\nchildren?\"\n\n\"Which affect the dead and the living both,\" answered the lawyer.\n\"Circumstances, I grieve to say, which involve the future of Mr.\nVanstone's unhappy daughters.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Miss Garth, \"wait a little.\" She pushed her gray hair back\nfrom her temples, and struggled with the sickness of heart, the dreadful\nfaintness of terror, which would have overpowered a younger or a less\nresolute woman. Her eyes, dim with watching, weary with grief, searched\nthe lawyer's unfathomable face. \"His unhappy daughters?\" she repeated\nto herself, vacantly. \"He talks as if there was some worse calamity than\nthe calamity which has made them orphans.\" She paused once more; and\nrallied her sinking courage. \"I will not make your hard duty, sir, more\npainful to you than I can help,\" she resumed. \"Show me the place in the\nwill. Let me read it, and know the worst.\"\n\nMr. Pendril turned back to the first page, and pointed to a certain\nplace in the cramped lines of writing. \"Begin here,\" he said.\n\nShe tried to begin; she tried to follow his finger, as she had followed\nit already to the signatures and the dates. But her senses seemed to\nshare the confusion of her mind--the words mingled together, and the\nlines swam before her eyes.\n\n\"I can't follow you,\" she said. \"You must tell it, or read it to me.\"\nShe pushed her chair back from the table, and tried to collect herself.\n\"Stop!\" she exclaimed, as the lawyer, with visible hesitation and\nreluctance, took the papers in his own hand. \"One question, first. Does\nhis will provide for his children?\"\n\n\"His will provided for them, when he made it.\"\n\n\"When he made it!\" (Something of her natural bluntness broke out in her\nmanner as she repeated the answer.) \"Does it provide for them now?\"\n\n\"It does not.\"\n\nShe snatched the will from his hand, and threw it into a corner of the\nroom. \"You mean well,\" she said; \"you wish to spare me--but you are\nwasting your time, and my strength. If the will is useless, there let it\nlie. Tell me the truth, Mr. Pendril--tell it plainly, tell it instantly,\nin your own words!\"\n\nHe felt that it would be useless cruelty to resist that appeal. There\nwas no merciful alternative but to answer it on the spot.\n\n\"I must refer you to the spring of the present year, Miss Garth. Do you\nremember the fourth of March?\"\n\nHer attention wandered again; a thought seemed to have struck her at\nthe moment when he spoke. Instead of answering his inquiry, she put a\nquestion of her own.\n\n\"Let me break the news to myself,\" she said--\"let me anticipate you, if\nI can. His useless will, the terms in which you speak of his daughters,\nthe doubt you seem to feel of my continued respect for his memory, have\nopened a new view to me. Mr. Vanstone has died a ruined man--is that\nwhat you had to tell me?\"\n\n\"Far from it. Mr. Vanstone has died, leaving a fortune of more than\neighty thousand pounds--a fortune invested in excellent securities. He\nlived up to his income, but never beyond it; and all his debts added\ntogether would not reach two hundred pounds. If he had died a ruined\nman, I should have felt deeply for his children: but I should not have\nhesitated to tell you the truth, as I am hesitating now. Let me repeat\na question which escaped you, I think, when I first put it. Carry your\nmind back to the spring of this year. Do you remember the fourth of\nMarch?\"\n\nMiss Garth shook her head. \"My memory for dates is bad at the best of\ntimes,\" she said. \"I am too confused to exert it at a moment's notice.\nCan you put your question in no other form?\"\n\nHe put it in this form:\n\n\"Do you remember any domestic event in the spring of the present year\nwhich appeared to affect Mr. Vanstone more seriously than usual?\"\n\nMiss Garth leaned forward in her chair, and looked eagerly at Mr.\nPendril across the table. \"The journey to London!\" she exclaimed. \"I\ndistrusted the journey to London from the first! Yes! I remember Mr.\nVanstone receiving a letter--I remember his reading it, and looking so\naltered from himself that he startled us all.\"\n\n\"Did you notice any apparent understanding between Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone\non the subject of that letter?\"\n\n\"Yes: I did. One of the girls--it was Magdalen--mentioned the post-mark;\nsome place in America. It all comes back to me, Mr. Pendril. Mrs.\nVanstone looked excited and anxious, the moment she heard the place\nnamed. They went to London together the next day; they explained nothing\nto their daughters, nothing to me. Mrs. Vanstone said the journey was\nfor family affairs. I suspected something wrong; I couldn't tell what.\nMrs. Vanstone wrote to me from London, saying that her object was to\nconsult a physician on the state of her health, and not to alarm her\ndaughters by telling them. Something in the letter rather hurt me at the\ntime. I thought there might be some other motive that she was keeping\nfrom me. Did I do her wrong?\"\n\n\"You did her no wrong. There was a motive which she was keeping from\nyou. In revealing that motive, I reveal the painful secret which brings\nme to this house. All that I could do to prepare you, I have done. Let\nme now tell the truth in the plainest and fewest words. When Mr. and\nMrs. Vanstone left Combe-Raven, in the March of the present year--\"\n\nBefore he could complete the sentence, a sudden movement of Miss Garth's\ninterrupted him. She started violently, and looked round toward the\nwindow. \"Only the wind among the leaves,\" she said, faintly. \"My nerves\nare so shaken, the least thing startles me. Speak out, for God's sake!\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone left this house, tell me in plain words, why\ndid they go to London?\"\n\nIn plain words, Mr. Pendril told her:\n\n\"They went to London to be married.\"\n\nWith that answer he placed a slip of paper on the table. It was the\nmarriage certificate of the dead parents, and the date it bore was March\nthe twentieth, eighteen hundred and forty-six.\n\nMiss Garth neither moved nor spoke. The certificate lay beneath her\nunnoticed. She sat with her eyes rooted on the lawyer's face; her mind\nstunned, her senses helpless. He saw that all his efforts to break the\nshock of the discovery had been efforts made in vain; he felt the vital\nimportance of rousing her, and firmly and distinctly repeated the fatal\nwords.\n\n\"They went to London to be married,\" he said. \"Try to rouse yourself:\ntry to realize the plain fact first: the explanation shall come\nafterward. Miss Garth, I speak the miserable truth! In the spring of\nthis year they left home; they lived in London for a fortnight, in the\nstrictest retirement; they were married by license at the end of that\ntime. There is a copy of the certificate, which I myself obtained on\nMonday last. Read the date of the marriage for yourself. It is Friday,\nthe twentieth of March--the March of this present year.\"\n\nAs he pointed to the certificate, that faint breath of air among the\nshrubs beneath the window, which had startled Miss Garth, stirred the\nleaves once more. He heard it himself this time, and turned his face, so\nas to let the breeze play upon it. No breeze came; no breath of air that\nwas strong enough for him to feel, floated into the room.\n\nMiss Garth roused herself mechanically, and read the certificate. It\nseemed to produce no distinct impression on her: she laid it on one side\nin a lost, bewildered manner. \"Twelve years,\" she said, in low, hopeless\ntones--\"twelve quiet, happy years I lived with this family. Mrs.\nVanstone was my friend; my dear, valued friend--my sister, I might\nalmost say. I can't believe it. Bear with me a little, sir, I can't\nbelieve it yet.\"\n\n\"I shall help you to believe it when I tell you more,\" said Mr.\nPendril--\"you will understand me better when I take you back to the time\nof Mr. Vanstone's early life. I won't ask for your attention just yet.\nLet us wait a little, until you recover yourself.\"\n\nThey waited a few minutes. The lawyer took some letters from his pocket,\nreferred to them attentively, and put them back again. \"Can you listen\nto me, now?\" he asked, kindly. She bowed her head in answer. Mr. Pendril\nconsidered with himself for a moment, \"I must caution you on one point,\"\nhe said. \"If the aspect of Mr. Vanstone's character which I am now about\nto present to you seems in some respects at variance with your later\nexperience, bear in mind that, when you first knew him twelve years\nsince, he was a man of forty; and that, when I first knew him, he was a\nlad of nineteen.\"\n\nHis next words raised the veil, and showed the irrevocable Past.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\n\"THE fortune which Mr. Vanstone possessed when you knew him\" (the lawyer\nbegan) \"was part, and part only, of the inheritance which fell to him\non his father's death. Mr. Vanstone the elder was a manufacturer in\nthe North of England. He married early in life; and the children of the\nmarriage were either six or seven in number--I am not certain which.\nFirst, Michael, the eldest son, still living, and now an old man\nturned seventy. Secondly, Selina, the eldest daughter, who married in\nafter-life, and who died ten or eleven years ago. After those two came\nother sons and daughters, whose early deaths make it unnecessary to\nmention them particularly. The last and by many years the youngest of\nthe children was Andrew, whom I first knew, as I told you, at the age\nof nineteen. My father was then on the point of retiring from the active\npursuit of his profession; and in succeeding to his business, I also\nsucceeded to his connection with the Vanstones as the family solicitor.\n\n\"At that time, Andrew had just started in life by entering the army.\nAfter little more than a year of home-service, he was ordered out with\nhis regiment to Canada. When he quitted England, he left his father and\nhis elder brother Michael seriously at variance. I need not detain you\nby entering into the cause of the quarrel. I need only tell you that the\nelder Mr. Vanstone, with many excellent qualities, was a man of fierce\nand intractable temper. His eldest son had set him at defiance, under\ncircumstances which might have justly irritated a father of far milder\ncharacter; and he declared, in the most positive terms, that he would\nnever see Michael's face again. In defiance of my entreaties, and of\nthe entreaties of his wife, he tore up, in our presence, the will which\nprovided for Michael's share in the paternal inheritance. Such was the\nfamily position, when the younger son left home for Canada.\n\n\"Some months after Andrew's arrival with his regiment at Quebec, he\nbecame acquainted with a woman of great personal attractions, who\ncame, or said she came, from one of the Southern States of America. She\nobtained an immediate influence over him; and she used it to the basest\npurpose. You knew the easy, affectionate, trusting nature of the man in\nlater life--you can imagine how thoughtlessly he acted on the impulse of\nhis youth. It is useless to dwell on this lamentable part of the story.\nHe was just twenty-one: he was blindly devoted to a worthless woman;\nand she led him on, with merciless cunning, till it was too late to draw\nback. In one word, he committed the fatal error of his life: he married\nher.\n\n\"She had been wise enough in her own interests to dread the influence\nof his brother-officers, and to persuade him, up to the period of the\nmarriage ceremony, to keep the proposed union between them a secret.\nShe could do this; but she could not provide against the results of\naccident. Hardly three months had passed, when a chance disclosure\nexposed the life she had led before her marriage. But one alternative\nwas left to her husband--the alternative of instantly separating from\nher.\n\n\"The effect of the discovery on the unhappy boy--for a boy in\ndisposition he still was--may be judged by the event which followed the\nexposure. One of Andrew's superior officers--a certain Major Kirke, if\nI remember right--found him in his quarters, writing to his father a\nconfession of the disgraceful truth, with a loaded pistol by his side.\nThat officer saved the lad's life from his own hand, and hushed up the\nscandalous affair by a compromise. The marriage being a perfectly legal\none, and the wife's misconduct prior to the ceremony giving her husband\nno claim to his release from her by divorce, it was only possible to\nappeal to her sense of her own interests. A handsome annual allowance\nwas secured to her, on condition that she returned to the place from\nwhich she had come; that she never appeared in England; and that she\nceased to use her husband's name. Other stipulations were added to\nthese. She accepted them all; and measures were privately taken to have\nher well looked after in the place of her retreat. What life she led\nthere, and whether she performed all the conditions imposed on her, I\ncannot say. I can only tell you that she never, to my knowledge, came\nto England; that she never annoyed Mr. Vanstone; and that the annual\nallowance was paid her, through a local agent in America, to the day of\nher death. All that she wanted in marrying him was money; and money she\ngot.\n\n\"In the meantime, Andrew had left the regiment. Nothing would induce him\nto face his brother-officers after what had happened. He sold out and\nreturned to England. The first intelligence which reached him on his\nreturn was the intelligence of his father's death. He came to my office\nin London, before going home, and there learned from my lips how the\nfamily quarrel had ended.\n\n\"The will which Mr. Vanstone the elder had destroyed in my presence had\nnot been, so far as I know, replaced by another. When I was sent for, in\nthe usual course, on his death, I fully expected that the law would be\nleft to make the customary division among his widow and his children.\nTo my surprise, a will appeared among his papers, correctly drawn and\nexecuted, and dated about a week after the period when the first will\nhad been destroyed. He had maintained his vindictive purpose against\nhis eldest son, and had applied to a stranger for the professional\nassistance which I honestly believe he was ashamed to ask for at my\nhands.\n\n\"It is needless to trouble you with the provisions of the will in\ndetail. There were the widow and three surviving children to be provided\nfor. The widow received a life-interest only in a portion of the\ntestator's property. The remaining portion was divided between Andrew\nand Selina--two-thirds to the brother; one-third to the sister. On the\nmother's death, the money from which her income had been derived was\nto go to Andrew and Selina, in the same relative proportions as\nbefore--five thousand pounds having been first deducted from the sum and\npaid to Michael, as the sole legacy left by the implacable father to his\neldest son.\n\n\"Speaking in round numbers, the division of property, as settled by the\nwill, stood thus. Before the mother's death, Andrew had seventy thousand\npounds; Selina had thirty-five thousand pounds; Michael--had nothing.\nAfter the mother's death, Michael had five thousand pounds, to set\nagainst Andrew's inheritance augmented to one hundred thousand, and\nSelina's inheritance increased to fifty thousand.--Do not suppose that I\nam dwelling unnecessarily on this part of the subject. Every word I now\nspeak bears on interests still in suspense, which vitally concern Mr.\nVanstone's daughters. As we get on from past to present, keep in\nmind the terrible inequality of Michael's inheritance and Andrew's\ninheritance. The harm done by that vindictive will is, I greatly fear,\nnot over yet.\n\n\"Andrew's first impulse, when he heard the news which I had to tell him,\nwas worthy of the open, generous nature of the man. He at once proposed\nto divide his inheritance with his elder brother. But there was one\nserious obstacle in the way. A letter from Michael was waiting for him\nat my office when he came there, and that letter charged him with being\nthe original cause of estrangement between his father and his elder\nbrother. The efforts which he had made--bluntly and incautiously, I own,\nbut with the purest and kindest intentions, as I know--to compose\nthe quarrel before leaving home, were perverted, by the vilest\nmisconstruction, to support an accusation of treachery and falsehood\nwhich would have stung any man to the quick. Andrew felt, what I\nfelt, that if these imputations were not withdrawn before his generous\nintentions toward his brother took effect, the mere fact of their\nexecution would amount to a practical acknowledgment of the justice\nof Michael's charge against him. He wrote to his brother in the most\nforbearing terms. The answer received was as offensive as words could\nmake it. Michael had inherited his father's temper, unredeemed by his\nfather's better qualities: his second letter reiterated the charges\ncontained in the first, and declared that he would only accept the\noffered division as an act of atonement and restitution on Andrew's\npart. I next wrote to the mother to use her influence. She was herself\naggrieved at being left with nothing more than a life interest in\nher husband's property; she sided resolutely with Michael; and she\nstigmatized Andrew's proposal as an attempt to bribe her eldest son into\nwithdrawing a charge against his brother which that brother knew to\nbe true. After this last repulse, nothing more could be done. Michael\nwithdrew to the Continent; and his mother followed him there. She\nlived long enough, and saved money enough out of her income, to add\nconsiderably, at her death, to her elder son's five thousand pounds.\nHe had previously still further improved his pecuniary position by\nan advantageous marriage; and he is now passing the close of his days\neither in France or Switzerland--a widower, with one son. We shall\nreturn to him shortly. In the meantime, I need only tell you that Andrew\nand Michael never again met--never again communicated, even by writing.\nTo all intents and purposes they were dead to each other, from those\nearly days to the present time.\n\n\"You can now estimate what Andrew's position was when he left his\nprofession and returned to England. Possessed of a fortune, he was\nalone in the world; his future destroyed at the fair outset of life;\nhis mother and brother estranged from him; his sister lately married,\nwith interests and hopes in which he had no share. Men of firmer mental\ncaliber might have found refuge from such a situation as this in an\nabsorbing intellectual pursuit. He was not capable of the effort; all\nthe strength of his character lay in the affections he had wasted. His\nplace in the world was that quiet place at home, with wife and children\nto make his life happy, which he had lost forever. To look back was more\nthan he dare. To look forward was more than he could. In sheer despair,\nhe let his own impetuous youth drive him on; and cast himself into the\nlowest dissipations of a London life.\n\n\"A woman's falsehood had driven him to his ruin. A woman's love saved\nhim at the outset of his downward career. Let us not speak of her\nharshly--for we laid her with him yesterday in the grave.\n\n\"You, who only knew Mrs. Vanstone in later life, when illness and sorrow\nand secret care had altered and saddened her, can form no adequate\nidea of her attractions of person and character when she was a girl\nof seventeen. I was with Andrew when he first met her. I had tried\nto rescue him, for one night at least, from degrading associates and\ndegrading pleasures, by persuading him to go with me to a ball given by\none of the great City Companies. There they met. She produced a strong\nimpression on him the moment he saw her. To me, as to him, she was\na total stranger. An introduction to her, obtained in the customary\nmanner, informed him that she was the daughter of one Mr. Blake.\nThe rest he discovered from herself. They were partners in the dance\n(unobserved in that crowded ball-room) all through the evening.\n\n\"Circumstances were against her from the first. She was unhappy at home.\nHer family and friends occupied no recognized station in life: they were\nmean, underhand people, in every way unworthy of her. It was her first\nball--it was the first time she had ever met with a man who had the\nbreeding, the manners and the conversation of a gentleman. Are these\nexcuses for her, which I have no right to make? If we have any human\nfeeling for human weakness, surely not!\n\n\"The meeting of that night decided their future. When other meetings had\nfollowed, when the confession of her love had escaped her, he took the\none course of all others (took it innocently and unconsciously), which\nwas most dangerous to them both. His frankness and his sense of honor\nforbade him to deceive her: he opened his heart and told her the truth.\nShe was a generous, impulsive girl; she had no home ties strong enough\nto plead with her; she was passionately fond of him--and he had made\nthat appeal to her pity which, to the eternal honor of women, is the\nhardest of all appeals for them to resist. She saw, and saw truly, that\nshe alone stood between him and his ruin. The last chance of his rescue\nhung on her decision. She decided; and saved him.\n\n\"Let me not be misunderstood; let me not be accused of trifling with the\nserious social question on which my narrative forces me to touch. I will\ndefend her memory by no false reasoning--I will only speak the truth.\nIt is the truth that she snatched him from mad excesses which must have\nended in his early death. It is the truth that she restored him to\nthat happy home existence which you remember so tenderly--which _he_\nremembered so gratefully that, on the day when he was free, he made her\nhis wife. Let strict morality claim its right, and condemn her early\nfault. I have read my New Testament to little purpose, indeed, if\nChristian mercy may not soften the hard sentence against her--if\nChristian charity may not find a plea for her memory in the love and\nfidelity, the suffering and the sacrifice, of her whole life.\n\n\"A few words more will bring us to a later time, and to events which\nhave happened within your own experience.\n\n\"I need not remind you that the position in which Mr. Vanstone was now\nplaced could lead in the end to but one result--to a disclosure, more or\nless inevitable, of the truth. Attempts were made to keep the hopeless\nmisfortune of his life a secret from Miss Blake's family; and, as a\nmatter of course, those attempts failed before the relentless scrutiny\nof her father and her friends. What might have happened if her relatives\nhad been what is termed 'respectable' I cannot pretend to say. As it\nwas, they were people who could (in the common phrase) be conveniently\ntreated with. The only survivor of the family at the present time is\na scoundrel calling himself Captain Wragge. When I tell you that he\nprivately extorted the price of his silence from Mrs. Vanstone to\nthe last; and when I add that his conduct presents no extraordinary\nexception to the conduct, in their lifetime, of the other relatives--you\nwill understand what sort of people I had to deal with in my client's\ninterests, and how their assumed indignation was appeased.\n\n\"Having, in the first instance, left England for Ireland, Mr. Vanstone\nand Miss Blake remained there afterward for some years. Girl as she was,\nshe faced her position and its necessities without flinching. Having\nonce resolved to sacrifice her life to the man she loved; having quieted\nher conscience by persuading herself that his marriage was a legal\nmockery, and that she was 'his wife in the sight of Heaven,' she set\nherself from the first to accomplish the one foremost purpose of so\nliving with him, in the world's eye, as never to raise the suspicion\nthat she was not his lawful wife. The women are few, indeed, who cannot\nresolve firmly, scheme patiently, and act promptly where the dearest\ninterests of their lives are concerned. Mrs. Vanstone--she has a right\nnow, remember, to that name--Mrs. Vanstone had more than the average\nshare of a woman's tenacity and a woman's tact; and she took all the\nneedful precautions, in those early days, which her husband's less ready\ncapacity had not the art to devise--precautions to which they were\nlargely indebted for the preservation of their secret in later times.\n\n\"Thanks to these safeguards, not a shadow of suspicion followed them\nwhen they returned to England. They first settled in Devonshire, merely\nbecause they were far removed there from that northern county in which\nMr. Vanstone's family and connections had been known. On the part of his\nsurviving relatives, they had no curious investigations to dread. He\nwas totally estranged from his mother and his elder brother. His married\nsister had been forbidden by her husband (who was a clergyman) to hold\nany communication with him, from the period when he had fallen into the\ndeplorable way of life which I have described as following his return\nfrom Canada. Other relations he had none. When he and Miss Blake left\nDevonshire, their next change of residence was to this house. Neither\ncourting nor avoiding notice; simply happy in themselves, in their\nchildren, and in their quiet rural life; unsuspected by the few\nneighbors who formed their modest circle of acquaintance to be other\nthan what they seemed--the truth in their case, as in the cases of many\nothers, remained undiscovered until accident forced it into the light of\nday.\n\n\"If, in your close intimacy with them, it seems strange that they\nshould never have betrayed themselves, let me ask you to consider the\ncircumstances and you will understand the apparent anomaly. Remember\nthat they had been living as husband and wife, to all intents and\npurposes (except that the marriage-service had not been read over them),\nfor fifteen years before you came into the house; and bear in mind,\nat the same time, that no event occurred to disturb Mr. Vanstone's\nhappiness in the present, to remind him of the past, or to warn him of\nthe future, until the announcement of his wife's death reached him, in\nthat letter from America which you saw placed in his hand. From that day\nforth--when a past which _he_ abhorred was forced back to his memory;\nwhen a future which _she_ had never dared to anticipate was placed\nwithin her reach--you will soon perceive, if you have not perceived\nalready, that they both betrayed themselves, time after time; and that\nyour innocence of all suspicion, and their children's innocence of all\nsuspicion, alone prevented you from discovering the truth.\n\n\"The sad story of the past is now as well known to you as to me. I have\nhad hard words to speak. God knows I have spoken them with true sympathy\nfor the living, with true tenderness for the memory of the dead.\"\n\n\nHe paused, turned his face a little away, and rested his head on his\nhand, in the quiet, undemonstrative manner which was natural to him.\nThus far, Miss Garth had only interrupted his narrative by an occasional\nword or by a mute token of her attention. She made no effort to conceal\nher tears; they fell fast and silently over her wasted cheeks, as she\nlooked up and spoke to him. \"I have done you some injury, sir, in my\nthoughts,\" she said, with a noble simplicity. \"I know you better now.\nLet me ask your forgiveness; let me take your hand.\"\n\nThose words, and the action which accompanied them, touched him deeply.\nHe took her hand in silence. She was the first to speak, the first to\nset the example of self-control. It is one of the noble instincts of\nwomen that nothing more powerfully rouses them to struggle with their\nown sorrow than the sight of a man's distress. She quietly dried her\ntears; she quietly drew her chair round the table, so as to sit nearer\nto him when she spoke again.\n\n\"I have been sadly broken, Mr. Pendril, by what has happened in this\nhouse,\" she said, \"or I should have borne what you have told me better\nthan I have borne it to-day. Will you let me ask one question before\nyou go on? My heart aches for the children of my love--more than ever my\nchildren now. Is there no hope for their future? Are they left with no\nprospect but poverty before them?\"\n\nThe lawyer hesitated before he answered the question.\n\n\"They are left dependent,\" he said, at last, \"on the justice and the\nmercy of a stranger.\"\n\n\"Through the misfortune of their birth?\"\n\n\"Through the misfortunes which have followed the marriage of their\nparents.\"\n\nWith that startling answer he rose, took up the will from the floor, and\nrestored it to its former position on the table between them.\n\n\"I can only place the truth before you,\" he resumed, \"in one plain\nform of words. The marriage has destroyed this will, and has left Mr.\nVanstone's daughters dependent on their uncle.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the breeze stirred again among the shrubs under the window.\n\n\"On their uncle?\" repeated Miss Garth. She considered for a moment, and\nlaid her hand suddenly on Mr. Pendril's arm. \"Not on Michael Vanstone!\"\n\n\"Yes: on Michael Vanstone.\"\n\nMiss Garth's hand still mechanically grasped the lawyer's arm. Her whole\nmind was absorbed in the effort to realize the discovery which had now\nburst on her.\n\n\"Dependent on Michael Vanstone!\" she said to herself. \"Dependent on\ntheir father's bitterest enemy? How can it be?\"\n\n\"Give me your attention for a few minutes more,\" said Mr. Pendril, \"and\nyou shall hear. The sooner we can bring this painful interview to a\nclose, the sooner I can open communications with Mr. Michael Vanstone,\nand the sooner you will know what he decides on doing for his brother's\norphan daughters. I repeat to you that they are absolutely dependent\non him. You will most readily understand how and why, if we take up the\nchain of events where we last left it--at the period of Mr. and Mrs.\nVanstone's marriage.\"\n\n\"One moment, sir,\" said Miss Garth. \"Were you in the secret of that\nmarriage at the time when it took place?\"\n\n\"Unhappily, I was not. I was away from London--away from England at\nthe time. If Mr. Vanstone had been able to communicate with me when the\nletter from America announced the death of his wife, the fortunes of his\ndaughters would not have been now at stake.\"\n\nHe paused, and, before proceeding further, looked once more at the\nletters which he had consulted at an earlier period of the interview. He\ntook one letter from the rest, and put it on the table by his side.\n\n\"At the beginning of the present year,\" he resumed, \"a very serious\nbusiness necessity, in connection with some West Indian property\npossessed by an old client and friend of mine, required the presence\neither of myself, or of one of my two partners, in Jamaica. One of the\ntwo could not be spared; the other was not in health to undertake\nthe voyage. There was no choice left but for me to go. I wrote to\nMr. Vanstone, telling him that I should leave England at the end\nof February, and that the nature of the business which took me away\nafforded little hope of my getting back from the West Indies before\nJune. My letter was not written with any special motive. I merely\nthought it right--seeing that my partners were not admitted to my\nknowledge of Mr. Vanstone's private affairs--to warn him of my absence,\nas a measure of formal precaution which it was right to take. At the end\nof February I left England, without having heard from him. I was on\nthe sea when the news of his wife's death reached him, on the fourth of\nMarch: and I did not return until the middle of last June.\"\n\n\"You warned him of your departure,\" interposed Miss Garth. \"Did you not\nwarn him of your return?\"\n\n\"Not personally. My head-clerk sent him one of the circulars which were\ndispatched from my office, in various directions, to announce my return.\nIt was the first substitute I thought of for the personal letter which\nthe pressure of innumerable occupations, all crowding on me together\nafter my long absence, did not allow me leisure to write. Barely a month\nlater, the first information of his marriage reached me in a letter from\nhimself, written on the day of the fatal accident. The circumstances\nwhich induced him to write arose out of an event in which you must have\ntaken some interest--I mean the attachment between Mr. Clare's son and\nMr. Vanstone's youngest daughter.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that I was favorably disposed toward that attachment\nat the time,\" replied Miss Garth. \"I was ignorant then of the family\nsecret: I know better now.\"\n\n\"Exactly. The motive which you can now appreciate is the motive that\nleads us to the point. The young lady herself (as I have heard from\nthe elder Mr. Clare, to whom I am indebted for my knowledge of the\ncircumstances in detail) confessed her attachment to her father, and\ninnocently touched him to the quick by a chance reference to his own\nearly life. He had a long conversation with Mrs. Vanstone, at which\nthey both agreed that Mr. Clare must be privately informed of the\ntruth, before the attachment between the two young people was allowed to\nproceed further. It was painful in the last degree, both to husband\nand wife, to be reduced to this alternative. But they were resolute,\nhonorably resolute, in making the sacrifice of their own feelings; and\nMr. Vanstone betook himself on the spot to Mr. Clare's cottage.--You no\ndoubt observed a remarkable change in Mr. Vanstone's manner on that day;\nand you can now account for it?\"\n\nMiss Garth bowed her head, and Mr. Pendril went on.\n\n\"You are sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Clare's contempt for all\nsocial prejudices,\" he continued, \"to anticipate his reception of the\nconfession which his neighbor addressed to him. Five minutes after the\ninterview had begun, the two old friends were as easy and unrestrained\ntogether as usual. In the course of conversation, Mr. Vanstone mentioned\nthe pecuniary arrangement which he had made for the benefit of his\ndaughter and of her future husband--and, in doing so, he naturally\nreferred to his will here, on the table between us. Mr. Clare,\nremembering that his friend had been married in the March of that year,\nat once asked when the will had been executed: receiving the reply\nthat it had been made five years since; and, thereupon, astounded Mr.\nVanstone by telling him bluntly that the document was waste paper in the\neye of the law. Up to that moment he, like many other persons, had\nbeen absolutely ignorant that a man's marriage is, legally as well as\nsocially, considered to be the most important event in his life; that\nit destroys the validity of any will which he may have made as a single\nman; and that it renders absolutely necessary the entire re-assertion\nof his testamentary intentions in the character of a husband. The\nstatement of this plain fact appeared to overwhelm Mr. Vanstone.\nDeclaring that his friend had laid him under an obligation which he\nshould remember to his dying day, he at once left the cottage, at once\nreturned home, and wrote me this letter.\"\n\nHe handed the letter open to Miss Garth. In tearless, speechless grief,\nshe read these words:\n\n\n\"MY DEAR PENDRIL--Since we last wrote to each other an extraordinary\nchange has taken place in my life. About a week after you went away,\nI received news from America which told me that I was free. Need I\nsay what use I made of that freedom? Need I say that the mother of my\nchildren is now my Wife?\n\n\"If you are surprised at not having heard from me the moment you got\nback, attribute my silence, in great part--if not altogether--to my own\ntotal ignorance of the legal necessity for making another will. Not half\nan hour since, I was enlightened for the first time (under circumstances\nwhich I will mention when me meet) by my old friend, Mr. Clare. Family\nanxieties have had something to do with my silence as well. My wife's\nconfinement is close at hand; and, besides this serious anxiety, my\nsecond daughter is just engaged to be married. Until I saw Mr. Clare\nto-day, these matters so filled my mind that I never thought of writing\nto you during the one short month which is all that has passed since I\ngot news of your return. Now I know that my will must be made again,\nI write instantly. For God's sake, come on the day when you receive\nthis--come and relieve me from the dreadful thought that my two darling\ngirls are at this moment unprovided for. If anything happened to me,\nand if my desire to do their mother justice, ended (through my miserable\nignorance of the law) in leaving Norah and Magdalen disinherited, I\nshould not rest in my grave! Come at any cost, to yours ever,\n\n\"A. V.\"\n\n\n\"On the Saturday morning,\" Mr. Pendril resumed, \"those lines reached me.\nI instantly set aside all other business, and drove to the railway. At\nthe London terminus, I heard the first news of the Friday's accident;\nheard it, with conflicting accounts of the numbers and names of the\npassengers killed. At Bristol, they were better informed; and the\ndreadful truth about Mr. Vanstone was confirmed. I had time to recover\nmyself before I reached your station here, and found Mr. Clare's son\nwaiting for me. He took me to his father's cottage; and there, without\nlosing a moment, I drew out Mrs. Vanstone's will. My object was to\nsecure the only provision for her daughters which it was now possible to\nmake. Mr. Vanstone having died intestate, a third of his fortune would\ngo to his widow; and the rest would be divided among his next of kin.\nAs children born out of wedlock, Mr. Vanstone's daughters, under the\ncircumstances of their father's death, had no more claim to a share in\nhis property than the daughters of one of his laborers in the village.\nThe one chance left was that their mother might sufficiently recover to\nleave her third share to them, by will, in the event of her decease. Now\nyou know why I wrote to you to ask for that interview--why I waited\nday and night, in the hope of receiving a summons to the house. I was\nsincerely sorry to send back such an answer to your note of inquiry as I\nwas compelled to write. But while there was a chance of the preservation\nof Mrs. Vanstone's life, the secret of the marriage was hers, not mine;\nand every consideration of delicacy forbade me to disclose it.\"\n\n\"You did right, sir,\" said Miss Garth; \"I understand your motives, and\nrespect them.\"\n\n\"My last attempt to provide for the daughters,\" continued Mr. Pendril,\n\"was, as you know, rendered unavailing by the dangerous nature of Mrs.\nVanstone's illness. Her death left the infant who survived her by a few\nhours (the infant born, you will remember, in lawful wedlock) possessed,\nin due legal course, of the whole of Mr. Vanstone's fortune. On the\nchild's death--if it had only outlived the mother by a few seconds,\ninstead of a few hours, the result would have been the same--the next of\nkin to the legitimate offspring took the money; and that next of kin\nis the infant's paternal uncle, Michael Vanstone. The whole fortune\nof eighty thousand pounds has virtually passed into his possession\nalready.\"\n\n\"Are there no other relations?\" asked Miss Garth. \"Is there no hope from\nany one else?\"\n\n\"There are no other relations with Michael Vanstone's claim,\" said the\nlawyer. \"There are no grandfathers or grandmothers of the dead child (on\nthe side of either of the parents) now alive. It was not likely there\nshould be, considering the ages of Mr. and Mrs. Vanstone when they died.\nBut it is a misfortune to be reasonably lamented that no other uncles or\naunts survive. There are cousins alive; a son and two daughters of that\nelder sister of Mr. Vanstone's, who married Archdeacon Bartram, and who\ndied, as I told you, some years since. But their interest is superseded\nby the interest of the nearer blood. No, Miss Garth, we must look\nfacts as they are resolutely in the face. Mr. Vanstone's daughters are\nNobody's Children; and the law leaves them helpless at their uncle's\nmercy.\"\n\n\"A cruel law, Mr. Pendril--a cruel law in a Christian country.\"\n\n\"Cruel as it is, Miss Garth, it stands excused by a shocking peculiarity\nin this case. I am far from defending the law of England as it affects\nillegitimate offspring. On the contrary, I think it a disgrace to the\nnation. It visits the sins of the parents on the children; it encourages\nvice by depriving fathers and mothers of the strongest of all motives\nfor making the atonement of marriage; and it claims to produce these two\nabominable results in the names of morality and religion. But it has\nno extraordinary oppression to answer for in the case of these unhappy\ngirls. The more merciful and Christian law of other countries, which\nallows the marriage of the parents to make the children legitimate, has\nno mercy on _these_ children. The accident of their father having been\nmarried, when he first met with their mother, has made them the outcasts\nof the whole social community; it has placed them out of the pale of\nthe Civil Law of Europe. I tell you the hard truth--it is useless to\ndisguise it. There is no hope, if we look back at the past: there may\nbe hope, if we look on to the future. The best service which I can now\nrender you is to shorten the period of your suspense. In less than an\nhour I shall be on my way back to London. Immediately on my arrival,\nI will ascertain the speediest means of communicating with Mr. Michael\nVanstone; and will let you know the result. Sad as the position of the\ntwo sisters now is, we must look at it on its best side; we must not\nlose hope.\"\n\n\"Hope?\" repeated Miss Garth. \"Hope from Michael Vanstone!\"\n\n\"Yes; hope from the influence on him of time, if not from the influence\nof mercy. As I have already told you, he is now an old man; he cannot,\nin the course of nature, expect to live much longer. If he looks back to\nthe period when he and his brother were first at variance, he must look\nback through thirty years. Surely, these are softening influences\nwhich must affect any man? Surely, his own knowledge of the shocking\ncircumstances under which he has become possessed of this money will\nplead with him, if nothing else does?\"\n\n\"I will try to think as you do, Mr. Pendril--I will try to hope for the\nbest. Shall we be left long in suspense before the decision reaches us?\"\n\n\"I trust not. The only delay on my side will be caused by the necessity\nof discovering the place of Michael Vanstone's residence on the\nContinent. I think I have the means of meeting this difficulty\nsuccessfully; and the moment I reach London, those means shall be\ntried.\"\n\nHe took up his hat; and then returned to the table on which the father's\nlast letter, and the father's useless will, were lying side by side.\nAfter a moment's consideration, he placed them both in Miss Garth's\nhands.\n\n\"It may help you in breaking the hard truth to the orphan sisters,\"\nhe said, in his quiet, self-repressed way, \"if they can see how their\nfather refers to them in his will--if they can read his letter to me,\nthe last he ever wrote. Let these tokens tell them that the one idea of\ntheir father's life was the idea of making atonement to his children.\n'They may think bitterly of their birth,' he said to me, at the time\nwhen I drew this useless will; 'but they shall never think bitterly of\nme. I will cross them in nothing: they shall never know a sorrow that\nI can spare them, or a want which I will not satisfy.' He made me put\nthose words in his will, to plead for him when the truth which he had\nconcealed from his children in his lifetime was revealed to them\nafter his death. No law can deprive his daughters of the legacy of his\nrepentance and his love. I leave the will and the letter to help you: I\ngive them both into your care.\"\n\nHe saw how his parting kindness touched her and thoughtfully hastened\nthe farewell. She took his hand in both her own and murmured a few\nbroken words of gratitude. \"Trust me to do my best,\" he said--and,\nturning away with a merciful abruptness, left her. In the broad,\ncheerful sunshine he had come in to reveal the fatal truth. In the\nbroad, cheerful sunshine--that truth disclosed--he went out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nIT was nearly an hour past noon when Mr. Pendril left the house. Miss\nGarth sat down again at the table alone, and tried to face the necessity\nwhich the event of the morning now forced on her.\n\nHer mind was not equal to the effort. She tried to lessen the strain on\nit--to lose the sense of her own position--to escape from her thoughts\nfor a few minutes only. After a little, she opened Mr. Vanstone's\nletter, and mechanically set herself to read it through once more.\n\nOne by one, the last words of the dead man fastened themselves more\nand more firmly on her attention. The unrelieved solitude, the unbroken\nsilence, helped their influence on her mind and opened it to those very\nimpressions of past and present which she was most anxious to shun.\nAs she reached the melancholy lines which closed the letter, she found\nherself--insensibly, almost unconsciously, at first--tracing the fatal\nchain of events, link by link backward, until she reached its beginning\nin the contemplated marriage between Magdalen and Francis Clare.\n\nThat marriage had taken Mr. Vanstone to his old friend, with the\nconfession on his lips which would otherwise never have escaped them.\nThence came the discovery which had sent him home to summon the\nlawyer to the house. That summons, again, had produced the inevitable\nacceleration of the Saturday's journey to Friday; the Friday of the\nfatal accident, the Friday when he went to his death. From his death\nfollowed the second bereavement which had made the house desolate; the\nhelpless position of the daughters whose prosperous future had been his\ndearest care; the revelation of the secret which had overwhelmed her\nthat morning; the disclosure, more terrible still, which she now stood\ncommitted to make to the orphan sisters. For the first time she saw the\nwhole sequence of events--saw it as plainly as the cloudless blue of the\nsky and the green glow of the trees in the sunlight outside.\n\nHow--when could she tell them? Who could approach them with the\ndisclosure of their own illegitimacy before their father and mother had\nbeen dead a week? Who could speak the dreadful words, while the first\ntears were wet on their cheeks, while the first pang of separation was\nat its keenest in their hearts, while the memory of the funeral was not\na day old yet? Not their last friend left; not the faithful woman\nwhose heart bled for them. No! silence for the present time, at all\nrisks--merciful silence, for many days to come!\n\nShe left the room, with the will and the letter in her hand--with the\nnatural, human pity at her heart which sealed her lips and shut her eyes\nresolutely to the future. In the hall she stopped and listened. Not a\nsound was audible. She softly ascended the stairs, on her way to her\nown room, and passed the door of Norah's bed-chamber. Voices inside,\nthe voices of the two sisters, caught her ear. After a moment's\nconsideration, she checked herself, turned back, and quickly descended\nthe stairs again. Both Norah and Magdalen knew of the interview between\nMr. Pendril and herself; she had felt it her duty to show them his\nletter making the appointment. Could she excite their suspicion by\nlocking herself up from them in her room as soon as the lawyer had left\nthe house? Her hand trembled on the banister; she felt that her face\nmight betray her. The self-forgetful fortitude, which had never failed\nher until that day, had been tried once too often--had been tasked\nbeyond its powers at last.\n\nAt the hall door she reflected for a moment again, and went into the\ngarden; directing her steps to a rustic bench and table placed out of\nsight of the house among the trees. In past times she had often sat\nthere, with Mrs. Vanstone on one side, with Norah on the other, with\nMagdalen and the dogs romping on the grass. Alone she sat there now--the\nwill and the letter which she dared not trust out of her own possession,\nlaid on the table--her head bowed over them; her face hidden in her\nhands. Alone she sat there and tried to rouse her sinking courage.\n\nDoubts thronged on her of the dark days to come; dread beset her of\nthe hidden danger which her own silence toward Norah and Magdalen might\nstore up in the near future. The accident of a moment might suddenly\nreveal the truth. Mr. Pendril might write, might personally address\nhimself to the sisters, in the natural conviction that she had\nenlightened them. Complications might gather round them at a moment's\nnotice; unforeseen necessities might arise for immediately leaving the\nhouse. She saw all these perils--and still the cruel courage to face the\nworst, and speak, was as far from her as ever. Ere long the thickening\nconflict of her thoughts forced its way outward for relief, in words and\nactions. She raised her head and beat her hand helplessly on the table.\n\n\"God help me, what am I to do?\" she broke out. \"How am I to tell them?\"\n\n\"There is no need to tell them,\" said a voice behind her. \"They know it\nalready.\"\n\nShe started to her feet and looked round. It was Magdalen who stood\nbefore her--Magdalen who had spoken those words.\n\nYes, there was the graceful figure, in its mourning garments, standing\nout tall and black and motionless against the leafy background. There\nwas Magdalen herself, with a changeless stillness on her white face;\nwith an icy resignation in her steady gray eyes.\n\n\"We know it already,\" she repeated, in clear, measured tones. \"Mr.\nVanstone's daughters are Nobody's Children; and the law leaves them\nhelpless at their uncle's mercy.\"\n\nSo, without a tear on her cheeks, without a faltering tone in her voice,\nshe repeated the lawyer's own words, exactly as he had spoken them. Miss\nGarth staggered back a step and caught at the bench to support herself.\nHer head swam; she closed her eyes in a momentary faintness. When they\nopened again, Magdalen's arm was supporting her, Magdalen's breath\nfanned her cheek, Magdalen's cold lips kissed her. She drew back from\nthe kiss; the touch of the girl's lips thrilled her with terror.\n\nAs soon as she could speak she put the inevitable question. \"You heard\nus,\" she said. \"Where?\"\n\n\"Under the open window.\"\n\n\"All the time?\"\n\n\"From beginning to end.\"\n\nShe had listened--this girl of eighteen, in the first week of her\norphanage, had listened to the whole terrible revelation, word by word,\nas it fell from the lawyer's lips; and had never once betrayed herself!\nFrom first to last, the only movements which had escaped her had been\nmovements guarded enough and slight enough to be mistaken for the\npassage of the summer breeze through the leaves!\n\n\"Don't try to speak yet,\" she said, in softer and gentler tones. \"Don't\nlook at me with those doubting eyes. What wrong have I done? When Mr.\nPendril wished to speak to you about Norah and me, his letter gave us\nour choice to be present at the interview, or to keep away. If my elder\nsister decided to keep away, how could I come? How could I hear my\nown story except as I did? My listening has done no harm. It has\ndone good--it has saved you the distress of speaking to us. You have\nsuffered enough for us already; it is time we learned to suffer for\nourselves. I have learned. And Norah is learning.\"\n\n\"Norah!\"\n\n\"Yes. I have done all I could to spare you. I have told Norah.\"\n\nShe had told Norah! Was this girl, whose courage had faced the terrible\nnecessity from which a woman old enough to be her mother had recoiled,\nthe girl Miss Garth had brought up? the girl whose nature she had\nbelieved to be as well known to her as her own?\n\n\"Magdalen!\" she cried out, passionately, \"you frighten me!\"\n\nMagdalen only sighed, and turned wearily away.\n\n\"Try not to think worse of me than I deserve,\" she said. \"I can't cry.\nMy heart is numbed.\"\n\nShe moved away slowly over the grass. Miss Garth watched the tall black\nfigure gliding away alone until it was lost among the trees. While it\nwas in sight she could think of nothing else. The moment it was gone,\nshe thought of Norah. For the first time in her experience of the\nsisters her heart led her instinctively to the elder of the two.\n\nNorah was still in her own room. She was sitting on the couch by the\nwindow, with her mother's old music-book--the keepsake which Mrs.\nVanstone had found in her husband's study on the day of her husband's\ndeath--spread open on her lap. She looked up from it with such quiet\nsorrow, and pointed with such ready kindness to the vacant place at her\nside, that Miss Garth doubted for the moment whether Magdalen had spoken\nthe truth. \"See,\" said Norah, simply, turning to the first leaf in\nthe music-book--\"my mother's name written in it, and some verses to\nmy father on the next page. We may keep this for ourselves, if we keep\nnothing else.\" She put her arm round Miss Garth's neck, and a faint\ntinge of color stole over her cheeks. \"I see anxious thoughts in your\nface,\" she whispered. \"Are you anxious about me? Are you doubting\nwhether I have heard it? I have heard the whole truth. I might have\nfelt it bitterly, later; it is too soon to feel it now. You have seen\nMagdalen? She went out to find you--where did you leave her?\"\n\n\"In the garden. I couldn't speak to her; I couldn't look at her.\nMagdalen has frightened me.\"\n\nNorah rose hurriedly; rose, startled and distressed by Miss Garth's\nreply.\n\n\"Don't think ill of Magdalen,\" she said. \"Magdalen suffers in secret\nmore than I do. Try not to grieve over what you have heard about us this\nmorning. Does it matter who we are, or what we keep or lose? What loss\nis there for us after the loss of our father and mother? Oh, Miss Garth,\n_there_ is the only bitterness! What did we remember of them when we\nlaid them in the grave yesterday? Nothing but the love they gave us--the\nlove we must never hope for again. What else can we remember to-day?\nWhat change can the world, and the world's cruel laws make in _our_\nmemory of the kindest father, the kindest mother, that children ever\nhad!\" She stopped: struggled with her rising grief; and quietly,\nresolutely, kept it down. \"Will you wait here,\" she said, \"while I go\nand bring Magdalen back? Magdalen was always your favorite: I want\nher to be your favorite still.\" She laid the music-book gently on Miss\nGarth's lap--and left the room.\n\n\"Magdalen was always your favorite.\"\n\nTenderly as they had been spoken, those words fell reproachfully on Miss\nGarth's ear. For the first time in the long companionship of her pupils\nand herself a doubt whether she, and all those about her, had not been\nfatally mistaken in their relative estimate of the sisters, now forced\nitself on her mind.\n\nShe had studied the natures of her two pupils in the daily intimacy of\ntwelve years. Those natures, which she believed herself to have sounded\nthrough all their depths, had been suddenly tried in the sharp ordeal\nof affliction. How had they come out from the test? As her previous\nexperience had prepared her to see them? No: in flat contradiction to\nit.\n\nWhat did such a result as this imply?\n\nThoughts came to her, as she asked herself that question, which have\nstartled and saddened us all.\n\nDoes there exist in every human being, beneath that outward and visible\ncharacter which is shaped into form by the social influences surrounding\nus, an inward, invisible disposition, which is part of ourselves, which\neducation may indirectly modify, but can never hope to change? Is\nthe philosophy which denies this and asserts that we are born with\ndispositions like blank sheets of paper a philosophy which has failed\nto remark that we are not born with blank faces--a philosophy which has\nnever compared together two infants of a few days old, and has never\nobserved that those infants are not born with blank tempers for mothers\nand nurses to fill up at will? Are there, infinitely varying with each\nindividual, inbred forces of Good and Evil in all of us, deep down below\nthe reach of mortal encouragement and mortal repression--hidden Good and\nhidden Evil, both alike at the mercy of the liberating opportunity\nand the sufficient temptation? Within these earthly limits, is earthly\nCircumstance ever the key; and can no human vigilance warn us beforehand\nof the forces imprisoned in ourselves which that key _may_ unlock?\n\nFor the first time, thoughts such as these rose darkly--as shadowy and\nterrible possibilities--in Miss Garth's mind. For the first time, she\nassociated those possibilities with the past conduct and characters,\nwith the future lives and fortunes of the orphan sisters.\n\nSearching, as in a glass darkly, into the two natures, she felt her way,\ndoubt by doubt, from one possible truth to another. It might be that\nthe upper surface of their characters was all that she had, thus far,\nplainly seen in Norah and Magdalen. It might be that the unalluring\nsecrecy and reserve of one sister, the all-attractive openness and high\nspirits of the other, were more or less referable, in each case, to\nthose physical causes which work toward the production of moral results.\nIt might be, that under the surface so formed--a surface which there had\nbeen nothing, hitherto, in the happy, prosperous, uneventful lives of\nthe sisters to disturb--forces of inborn and inbred disposition had\nremained concealed, which the shock of the first serious calamity in\ntheir lives had now thrown up into view. Was this so? Was the promise\nof the future shining with prophetic light through the surface-shadow\nof Norah's reserve, and darkening with prophetic gloom, under the\nsurface-glitter of Magdalen's bright spirits? If the life of the\nelder sister was destined henceforth to be the ripening ground of the\nundeveloped Good that was in her-was the life of the younger doomed to\nbe the battle-field of mortal conflict with the roused forces of Evil in\nherself?\n\nOn the brink of that terrible conclusion, Miss Garth shrank back\nin dismay. Her heart was the heart of a true woman. It accepted the\nconviction which raised Norah higher in her love: it rejected the doubt\nwhich threatened to place Magdalen lower. She rose and paced the room\nimpatiently; she recoiled with an angry suddenness from the whole train\nof thought in which her mind had been engaged but the moment before.\nWhat if there were dangerous elements in the strength of Magdalen's\ncharacter--was it not her duty to help the girl against herself? How had\nshe performed that duty? She had let herself be governed by first\nfears and first impressions; she had never waited to consider whether\nMagdalen's openly acknowledged action of that morning might not imply a\nself-sacrificing fortitude, which promised, in after-life, the noblest\nand the most enduring results. She had let Norah go and speak those\nwords of tender remonstrance, which she should first have spoken\nherself. \"Oh!\" she thought, bitterly, \"how long I have lived in the\nworld, and how little I have known of my own weakness and wickedness\nuntil to-day!\"\n\n\n\nThe door of the room opened. Norah came in, as she had gone out, alone.\n\n\"Do you remember leaving anything on the little table by the\ngarden-seat?\" she asked, quietly.\n\nBefore Miss Garth could answer the question, she held out her father's\nwill and her father's letter.\n\n\"Magdalen came back after you went away,\" she said, \"and found these\nlast relics. She heard Mr. Pendril say they were her legacy and mine.\nWhen I went into the garden she was reading the letter. There was no\nneed for me to speak to her; our father had spoken to her from his\ngrave. See how she has listened to him!\"\n\nShe pointed to the letter. The traces of heavy tear-drops lay thick over\nthe last lines of the dead man's writing.\n\n\"_Her_ tears,\" said Norah, softly.\n\nMiss Garth's head drooped low over the mute revelation of Magdalen's\nreturn to her better self.\n\n\"Oh, never doubt her again!\" pleaded Norah. \"We are alone now--we have\nour hard way through the world to walk on as patiently as we can. If\nMagdalen ever falters and turns back, help her for the love of old\ntimes; help her against herself.\"\n\n\"With all my heart and strength--as God shall judge me, with the\ndevotion of my whole life!\" In those fervent words Miss Garth answered.\nShe took the hand which Norah held out to her, and put it, in sorrow and\nhumility, to her lips. \"Oh, my love, forgive me! I have been miserably\nblind--I have never valued you as I ought!\"\n\nNorah gently checked her before she could say more; gently whispered,\n\"Come with me into the garden--come, and help Magdalen to look patiently\nto the future.\"\n\nThe future! Who could see the faintest glimmer of it? Who could see\nanything but the ill-omened figure of Michael Vanstone, posted darkly\non the verge of the present time--and closing all the prospect that lay\nbeyond him?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nON the next morning but one, news was received from Mr. Pendril.\nThe place of Michael Vanstone's residence on the Continent had been\ndiscovered. He was living at Zurich; and a letter had been dispatched to\nhim, at that place, on the day when the information was obtained. In the\ncourse of the coming week an answer might be expected, and the purport\nof it should be communicated forthwith to the ladies at Combe-Raven.\n\nShort as it was, the interval of delay passed wearily. Ten days elapsed\nbefore the expected answer was received; and when it came at last, it\nproved to be, strictly speaking, no answer at all. Mr. Pendril had been\nmerely referred to an agent in London who was in possession of Michael\nVanstone's instructions. Certain difficulties had been discovered in\nconnection with those instructions, which had produced the necessity of\nonce more writing to Zurich. And there \"the negotiations\" rested again\nfor the present.\n\nA second paragraph in Mr. Pendril's letter contained another piece of\nintelligence entirely new. Mr. Michael Vanstone's son (and only child),\nMr. Noel Vanstone, had recently arrived in London, and was then staying\nin lodgings occupied by his cousin, Mr. George Bartram. Professional\nconsiderations had induced Mr. Pendril to pay a visit to the lodgings.\nHe had been very kindly received by Mr. Bartram; but had been informed\nby that gentleman that his cousin was not then in a condition to receive\nvisitors. Mr. Noel Vanstone had been suffering, for some years past,\nfrom a wearing and obstinate malady; he had come to England expressly\nto obtain the best medical advice, and he still felt the fatigue of\nthe journey so severely as to be confined to his bed. Under these\ncircumstances, Mr. Pendril had no alternative but to take his leave.\nAn interview with Mr. Noel Vanstone might have cleared up some of the\ndifficulties in connection with his father's instructions. As events had\nturned out, there was no help for it but to wait for a few days more.\n\nThe days passed, the empty days of solitude and suspense. At last, a\nthird letter from the lawyer announced the long delayed conclusion of\nthe correspondence. The final answer had been received from Zurich,\nand Mr. Pendril would personally communicate it at Combe-Raven on the\nafternoon of the next day.\n\nThat next day was Wednesday, the twelfth of August. The weather had\nchanged in the night; and the sun rose watery through mist and cloud.\nBy noon the sky was overcast at all points; the temperature was sensibly\ncolder; and the rain poured down, straight and soft and steady, on the\nthirsty earth. Toward three o'clock, Miss Garth and Norah entered the\nmorning-room, to await Mr. Pendril's arrival. They were joined shortly\nafterward by Magdalen. In half an hour more the familiar fall of the\niron latch in the socket reached their ears from the fence beyond\nthe shrubbery. Mr. Pendril and Mr. Clare advanced into view along the\ngarden-path, walking arm-in-arm through the rain, sheltered by the same\numbrella. The lawyer bowed as they passed the windows; Mr. Clare walked\nstraight on, deep in his own thoughts--noticing nothing.\n\nAfter a delay which seemed interminable; after a weary scraping of\nwet feet on the hall mat; after a mysterious, muttered interchange of\nquestion and answer outside the door, the two came in--Mr. Clare leading\nthe way. The old man walked straight up to the table, without any\npreliminary greeting, and looked across it at the three women, with a\nstern pity for them in his ragged, wrinkled face.\n\n\"Bad news,\" he said. \"I am an enemy to all unnecessary suspense.\nPlainness is kindness in such a case as this. I mean to be kind--and I\ntell you plainly--bad news.\"\n\nMr. Pendril followed him. He shook hands, in silence, with Miss Garth\nand the two sisters, and took a seat near them. Mr. Clare placed himself\napart on a chair by the window. The gray rainy light fell soft and sad\non the faces of Norah and Magdalen, who sat together opposite to him.\nMiss Garth had placed herself a little behind them, in partial shadow;\nand the lawyer's quiet face was seen in profile, close beside her. So\nthe four occupants of the room appeared to Mr. Clare, as he sat apart in\nhis corner; his long claw-like fingers interlaced on his knee; his dark\nvigilant eyes fixed searchingly now on one face, now on another. The\ndripping rustle of the rain among the leaves, and the clear, ceaseless\ntick of the clock on the mantel-piece, made the minute of silence\nwhich followed the settling of the persons present in their places\nindescribably oppressive. It was a relief to every one when Mr. Pendril\nspoke.\n\n\"Mr. Clare has told you already,\" he began, \"that I am the bearer of bad\nnews. I am grieved to say, Miss Garth, that your doubts, when I last\nsaw you, were better founded than my hopes. What that heartless elder\nbrother was in his youth, he is still in his old age. In all my unhappy\nexperience of the worst side of human nature, I have never met with\na man so utterly dead to every consideration of mercy as Michael\nVanstone.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he takes the whole of his brother's fortune, and makes\nno provision whatever for his brother's children?\" asked Miss Garth.\n\n\"He offers a sum of money for present emergencies,\" replied Mr. Pendril,\n\"so meanly and disgracefully insufficient that I am ashamed to mention\nit.\"\n\n\"And nothing for the future?\"\n\n\"Absolutely nothing.\"\n\nAs that answer was given, the same thought passed, at the same moment,\nthrough Miss Garth's mind and through Norah's. The decision, which\ndeprived both the sisters alike of the resources of fortune, did not\nend there for the younger of the two. Michael Vanstone's merciless\nresolution had virtually pronounced the sentence which dismissed Frank\nto China, and which destroyed all present hope of Magdalen's marriage.\nAs the words passed the lawyer's lips, Miss Garth and Norah looked at\nMagdalen anxiously. Her face turned a shade paler--but not a feature of\nit moved; not a word escaped her. Norah, who held her sister's hand in\nher own, felt it tremble for a moment, and then turn cold--and that was\nall.\n\n\"Let me mention plainly what I have done,\" resumed Mr. Pendril; \"I am\nvery desirous you should not think that I have left any effort untried.\nWhen I wrote to Michael Vanstone, in the first instance, I did not\nconfine myself to the usual formal statement. I put before him, plainly\nand earnestly, every one of the circumstances under which he has\nbecome possessed of his brother's fortune. When I received the answer,\nreferring me to his written instructions to his lawyer in London--and\nwhen a copy of those instructions was placed in my hands--I positively\ndeclined, on becoming acquainted with them, to receive the writer's\ndecision as final. I induced the solicitor, on the other side, to\naccord us a further term of delay; I attempted to see Mr. Noel Vanstone\nin London for the purpose of obtaining his intercession; and, failing\nin that, I myself wrote to his father for the second time. The answer\nreferred me, in insolently curt terms, to the instructions already\ncommunicated; declared those instructions to be final; and declined any\nfurther correspondence with me. There is the beginning and the end\nof the negotiation. If I have overlooked any means of touching this\nheartless man--tell me, and those means shall be tried.\"\n\nHe looked at Norah. She pressed her sister's hand encouragingly, and\nanswered for both of them.\n\n\"I speak for my sister, as well as for myself,\" she said, with her color\na little heightened, with her natural gentleness of manner just touched\nby a quiet, uncomplaining sadness. \"You have done all that could be\ndone, Mr. Pendril. We have tried to restrain ourselves from hoping too\nconfidently; and we are deeply grateful for your kindness, at a time\nwhen kindness is sorely needed by both of us.\"\n\nMagdalen's hand returned the pressure of her sister's--withdrew\nitself--trifled for a moment impatiently with the arrangement of her\ndress--then suddenly moved the chair closer to the table. Leaning\none arm on it (with the hand fast clinched), she looked across at Mr.\nPendril. Her face, always remarkable for its want of color, was now\nstartling to contemplate, in its blank, bloodless pallor. But the light\nin her large gray eyes was bright and steady as ever; and her voice,\nthough low in tone, was clear and resolute in accent as she addressed\nthe lawyer in these terms:\n\n\"I understood you to say, Mr. Pendril, that my father's brother had\nsent his written orders to London, and that you had a copy. Have you\npreserved it?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Have you got it about you?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"May I see it?\"\n\nMr. Pendril hesitated, and looked uneasily from Magdalen to Miss Garth,\nand from Miss Garth back again to Magdalen.\n\n\"Pray oblige me by not pressing your request,\" he said. \"It is surely\nenough that you know the result of the instructions. Why should you\nagitate yourself to no purpose by reading them? They are expressed so\ncruelly; they show such abominable want of feeling, that I really cannot\nprevail upon myself to let you see them.\"\n\n\"I am sensible of your kindness, Mr. Pendril, in wishing to spare me\npain. But I can bear pain; I promise to distress nobody. Will you excuse\nme if I repeat my request?\"\n\nShe held out her hand--the soft, white, virgin hand that had touched\nnothing to soil it or harden it yet.\n\n\"Oh, Magdalen, think again!\" said Norah.\n\n\"You distress Mr. Pendril,\" added Miss Garth; \"you distress us all.\"\n\n\"There can be no end gained,\" pleaded the lawyer--\"forgive me for saying\nso--there can really be no useful end gained by my showing you the\ninstructions.\"\n\n(\"Fools!\" said Mr. Clare to himself. \"Have they no eyes to see that she\nmeans to have her own way?\")\n\n\"Something tells me there is an end to be gained,\" persisted Magdalen.\n\"This decision is a very serious one. It is more serious to me--\" She\nlooked round at Mr. Clare, who sat closely watching her, and instantly\nlooked back again, with the first outward betrayal of emotion which\nhad escaped her yet. \"It is even more serious to me,\" she resumed, \"for\nprivate reasons--than it is to my sister. I know nothing yet but that\nour father's brother has taken our fortunes from us. He must have some\nmotives of his own for such conduct as that. It is not fair to him, or\nfair to us, to keep those motives concealed. He has deliberately robbed\nNorah, and robbed me; and I think we have a right, if we wish it, to\nknow why?\"\n\n\"I don't wish it,\" said Norah.\n\n\"I do,\" said Magdalen; and once more she held out her hand.\n\nAt this point Mr. Clare roused himself and interfered for the first\ntime.\n\n\"You have relieved your conscience,\" he said, addressing the lawyer.\n\"Give her the right she claims. It _is_ her right--if she will have it.\"\n\nMr. Pendril quietly took the written instructions from his pocket.\n\"I have warned you,\" he said--and handed the papers across the table\nwithout another word. One of the pages of writing--was folded down at\nthe corner; and at that folded page the manuscript opened, when Magdalen\nfirst turned the leaves. \"Is this the place which refers to my sister\nand myself?\" she inquired. Mr. Pendril bowed; and Magdalen smoothed out\nthe manuscript before her on the table.\n\n\"Will you decide, Norah?\" she asked, turning to her sister. \"Shall I\nread this aloud, or shall I read it to myself?\"\n\n\"To yourself,\" said Miss Garth; answering for Norah, who looked at her\nin mute perplexity and distress.\n\n\"It shall be as you wish,\" said Magdalen. With that reply, she turned\nagain to the manuscript and read these lines:\n\n\n\".... You are now in possession of my wishes in relation to the\nproperty in money, and to the sale of the furniture, carriages, horses,\nand so forth. The last point left on which it is necessary for me to\ninstruct you refers to the persons inhabiting the house, and to certain\npreposterous claims on their behalf set up by a solicitor named Pendril;\nwho has, no doubt, interested reasons of his own for making application\nto me.\n\n\"I understand that my late brother has left two illegitimate children;\nboth of them young women, who are of an age to earn their own\nlivelihood. Various considerations, all equally irregular, have been\nurged in respect to these persons by the solicitor representing them. Be\nso good as to tell him that neither you nor I have anything to do with\nquestions of mere sentiment; and then state plainly, for his better\ninformation, what the motives are which regulate my conduct, and what\nthe provision is which I feel myself justified in making for the two\nyoung women. Your instructions on both these points you will find\ndetailed in the next paragraph.\n\n\"I wish the persons concerned to know, once for all, how I regard\nthe circumstances which have placed my late brother's property at my\ndisposal. Let them understand that I consider those circumstances to be\na Providential interposition which has restored to me the inheritance\nthat ought always to have been mine. I receive the money, not only as\nmy right, but also as a proper compensation for the injustice which I\nsuffered from my father, and a proper penalty paid by my younger brother\nfor the vile intrigue by which he succeeded in disinheriting me. His\nconduct, when a young man, was uniformly discreditable in all the\nrelations of life; and what it then was it continued to be (on the\nshowing of his own legal representative) after the time when I ceased\nto hold any communication with him. He appears to have systematically\nimposed a woman on Society as his wife who was not his wife, and to\nhave completed the outrage on morality by afterward marrying her. Such\nconduct as this has called down a Judgment on himself and his children.\nI will not invite retribution on my own head by assisting those children\nto continue the imposition which their parents practiced, and by helping\nthem to take a place in the world to which they are not entitled. Let\nthem, as becomes their birth, gain their bread in situations. If they\nshow themselves disposed to accept their proper position I will assist\nthem to start virtuously in life by a present of one hundred pounds\neach. This sum I authorize you to pay them, on their personal\napplication, with the necessary acknowledgment of receipt; and on the\nexpress understanding that the transaction, so completed, is to be the\nbeginning and the end of my connection with them. The arrangements under\nwhich they quit the house I leave to your discretion; and I have only\nto add that my decision on this matter, as on all other matters, is\npositive and final.\"\n\n\nLine by line--without once looking up from the pages before her\n--Magdalen read those atrocious sentences through, from beginning to\nend. The other persons assembled in the room, all eagerly looking at her\ntogether, saw the dress rising and falling faster and faster over her\nbosom--saw the hand in which she lightly held the manuscript at the\noutset close unconsciously on the paper and crush it, as she advanced\nnearer and nearer to the end--but detected no other outward signs of\nwhat was passing within her. As soon as she had done, she silently\npushed the manuscript away, and put her hands on a sudden over her\nface. When she withdrew them, all the four persons in the room noticed\na change in her. Something in her expression had altered, subtly and\nsilently; something which made the familiar features suddenly look\nstrange, even to her sister and Miss Garth; something, through all after\nyears, never to be forgotten in connection with that day--and never to\nbe described.\n\nThe first words she spoke were addressed to Mr. Pendril.\n\n\"May I ask one more favor,\" she said, \"before you enter on your business\narrangements?\"\n\nMr. Pendril replied ceremoniously by a gesture of assent. Magdalen's\nresolution to possess herself of the Instructions did not appear to have\nproduced a favorable impression on the lawyer's mind.\n\n\"You mentioned what you were so kind as to do, in our interests, when\nyou first wrote to Mr. Michael Vanstone,\" she continued. \"You said you\nhad told him all the circumstances. I want--if you will allow me--to\nbe made quite sure of what he really knew about us--when he sent these\norders to his lawyer. Did he know that my father had made a will, and\nthat he had left our fortunes to my sister and myself?\"\n\n\"He did know it,\" said Mr. Pendril.\n\n\"Did you tell him how it happened that we are left in this helpless\nposition?\"\n\n\"I told him that your father was entirely unaware, when he married, of\nthe necessity for making another will.\"\n\n\"And that another will would have been made, after he saw Mr. Clare, but\nfor the dreadful misfortune of his death?\"\n\n\"He knew that also.\"\n\n\"Did he know that my father's untiring goodness and kindness to both of\nus--\"\n\nHer voice faltered for the first time: she sighed, and put her hand\nto her head wearily. Norah spoke entreatingly to her; Miss Garth spoke\nentreatingly to her; Mr. Clare sat silent, watching her more and more\nearnestly. She answered her sister's remonstrance with a faint smile.\n\"I will keep my promise,\" she said; \"I will distress nobody.\" With that\nreply, she turned again to Mr. Pendril; and steadily reiterated the\nquestion--but in another form of words.\n\n\"Did Mr. Michael Vanstone know that my father's great anxiety was to\nmake sure of providing for my sister and myself?\"\n\n\"He knew it in your father's own words. I sent him an extract from your\nfather's last letter to me.\"\n\n\"The letter which asked you to come for God's sake, and relieve him from\nthe dreadful thought that his daughters were unprovided for? The letter\nwhich said he should not rest in his grave if he left us disinherited?\"\n\n\"That letter and those words.\"\n\nShe paused, still keeping her eyes steadily fixed on the lawyer's face.\n\n\"I want to fasten it all in my mind,\" she said \"before I go on. Mr.\nMichael Vanstone knew of the first will; he knew what prevented the\nmaking of the second will; he knew of the letter and he read the words.\nWhat did he know of besides? Did you tell him of my mother's last\nillness? Did you say that her share in the money would have been left\nto us, if she could have lifted her dying hand in your presence? Did\nyou try to make him ashamed of the cruel law which calls girls in our\nsituation Nobody's Children, and which allows him to use us as he is\nusing us now?\"\n\n\"I put all those considerations to him. I left none of them doubtful; I\nleft none of them out.\"\n\nShe slowly reached her hand to the copy of the Instructions, and slowly\nfolded it up again, in the shape in which it had been presented to her.\n\"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Pendril.\" With those words, she bowed,\nand gently pushed the manuscript back across the table; then turned to\nher sister.\n\n\"Norah,\" she said, \"if we both of us live to grow old, and if you ever\nforget all that we owe to Michael Vanstone--come to me, and I will\nremind you.\"\n\nShe rose and walked across the room by herself to the window. As she\npassed Mr. Clare, the old man stretched out his claw-like fingers and\ncaught her fast by the arm before she was aware of him.\n\n\"What is this mask of yours hiding?\" he asked, forcing her to bend to\nhim, and looking close into her face. \"Which of the extremes of human\ntemperature does your courage start from--the dead cold or the white\nhot?\"\n\nShe shrank back from him and turned away her head in silence. She would\nhave resented that unscrupulous intrusion on her own thoughts from any\nman alive but Frank's father. He dropped her arm as suddenly as he had\ntaken it, and let her go on to the window. \"No,\" he said to himself,\n\"not the cold extreme, whatever else it may be. So much the worse for\nher, and for all belonging to her.\"\n\nThere was a momentary pause. Once more the dripping rustle of the rain\nand the steady ticking of the clock filled up the gap of silence. Mr.\nPendril put the Instructions back in his pocket, considered a little,\nand, turning toward Norah and Miss Garth, recalled their attention to\nthe present and pressing necessities of the time.\n\n\"Our consultation has been needlessly prolonged,\" he sail, \"by painful\nreferences to the past. We shall be better employed in settling our\narrangements for the future. I am obliged to return to town this\nevening. Pray let me hear how I can best assist you; pray tell me what\ntrouble and what responsibility I can take off your hands.\"\n\nFor the moment, neither Norah nor Miss Garth seemed to be capable of\nanswering him. Magdalen's reception of the news which annihilated the\nmarriage prospect that her father's own lips had placed before her not\na month since, had bewildered and dismayed them alike. They had summoned\ntheir courage to meet the shock of her passionate grief, or to face the\nharder trial of witnessing her speechless despair. But they were not\nprepared for her invincible resolution to read the Instructions; for the\nterrible questions which she had put to the lawyer; for her immovable\ndetermination to fix all the circumstances in her mind, under which\nMichael Vanstone's decision had been pronounced. There she stood at the\nwindow, an unfathomable mystery to the sister who had never been parted\nfrom her, to the governess who had trained her from a child. Miss Garth\nremembered the dark doubts which had crossed her mind on the day when\nshe and Magdalen had met in the garden. Norah looked forward to the\ncoming time, with the first serious dread of it on her sister's account\nwhich she had felt yet. Both had hitherto remained passive, in despair\nof knowing what to do. Both were now silent, in despair of knowing what\nto say.\n\nMr. Pendril patiently and kindly helped them, by returning to the\nsubject of their future plans for the second time.\n\n\"I am sorry to press any business matters on your attention,\" he said,\n\"when you are necessarily unfitted to deal with them. But I must take\nmy instructions back to London with me to night. With reference, in the\nfirst place, to the disgraceful pecuniary offer, to which I have already\nalluded. The younger Miss Vanstone having read the Instructions, needs\nno further information from my lips. The elder will, I hope, excuse me\nif I tell her (what I should be ashamed to tell her, but that it is\na matter of necessity), that Mr. Michael Vanstone's provision for his\nbrother's children begins and ends with an offer to each of them of one\nhundred pounds.\"\n\nNorah's face crimsoned with indignation. She started to her feet, as\nif Michael Vanstone had been present in the room, and had personally\ninsulted her.\n\n\"I see,\" said the lawyer, wishing to spare her; \"I may tell Mr. Michael\nVanstone you refuse the money.\"\n\n\"Tell him,\" she broke out passionately, \"if I was starving by the\nroadside, I wouldn't touch a farthing of it!\"\n\n\"Shall I notify your refusal also?\" asked Mr. Pendril, speaking to\nMagdalen next.\n\nShe turned round from the window--but kept her face in shadow, by\nstanding close against it with her back to the light.\n\n\"Tell him, on my part,\" she said, \"to think again before he starts me\nin life with a hundred pounds. I will give him time to think.\" She spoke\nthose strange words with a marked emphasis; and turning back quickly\nto the window, hid her face from the observation of every one in the\nroom.\n\n\"You both refuse the offer,\" said Mr. Pendril, taking out his pencil,\nand making his professional note of the decision. As he shut up his\npocketbook, he glanced toward Magdalen doubtfully. She had roused in\nhim the latent distrust which is a lawyer's second nature: he had his\nsuspicions of her looks; he had his suspicions of her language. Her\nsister seemed to have mere influence over her than Miss Garth. He\nresolved to speak privately to her sister before he went away.\n\nWhile the idea was passing through his mind, his attention was claimed\nby another question from Magdalen.\n\n\"Is he an old man?\" she asked, suddenly, without turning round from the\nwindow.\n\n\"If you mean Mr. Michael Vanstone, he is seventy-five or seventy-six\nyears of age.\"\n\n\"You spoke of his son a little while since. Has he any other sons--or\ndaughters?\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\n\"Do you know anything of his wife?\"\n\n\"She has been dead for many years.\"\n\nThere was a pause. \"Why do you ask these questions?\" said Norah.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" replied Magdalen, quietly; \"I won't ask any more.\"\n\nFor the third time, Mr. Pendril returned to the business of the\ninterview.\n\n\"The servants must not be forgotten,\" he said. \"They must be settled\nwith and discharged: I will give them the necessary explanation before\nI leave. As for the house, no questions connected with it need trouble\nyou. The carriages and horses, the furniture and plate, and so on, must\nsimply be left on the premises to await Mr. Michael Vanstone's further\norders. But any possessions, Miss Vanstone, personally belonging to you\nor to your sister--jewelry and dresses, and any little presents which\nmay have been made to you--are entirely at your disposal. With regard\nto the time of your departure, I understand that a month or more will\nelapse before Mr. Michael Vanstone can leave Zurich; and I am sure I\nonly do his solicitor justice in saying--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Pendril,\" interposed Norah; \"I think I understand, from\nwhat you have just said, that our house and everything in it belongs\nto--?\" She stopped, as if the mere utterance of the man's name was\nabhorrent to her.\n\n\"To Michael Vanstone,\" said Mr. Pendril. \"The house goes to him with the\nrest of the property.\"\n\n\"Then I, for one, am ready to leave it tomorrow!\"\n\nMagdalen started at the window, as her sister spoke, and looked at Mr.\nClare, with the first open signs of anxiety and alarm which she had\nshown yet.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me,\" she whispered, stooping over the old man with\na sudden humility of look, and a sudden nervousness of manner. \"I can't\ngo without seeing Frank first!\"\n\n\"You shall see him,\" replied Mr. Clare. \"I am here to speak to you about\nit, when the business is done.\"\n\n\"It is quite unnecessary to hurry your departure, as you propose,\"\ncontinued Mr. Pendril, addressing Norah. \"I can safely assure you that a\nweek hence will be time enough.\"\n\n\"If this is Mr. Michael Vanstone's house,\" repeated Norah; \"I am ready\nto leave it tomorrow.\"\n\nShe impatiently quitted her chair and seated herself further away on the\nsofa. As she laid her hand on the back of it, her face changed. There,\nat the head of the sofa, were the cushions which had supported her\nmother when she lay down for the last time to repose. There, at the foot\nof the sofa, was the clumsy, old-fashioned arm-chair, which had been her\nfather's favorite seat on rainy days, when she and her sister used to\namuse him at the piano opposite, by playing his favorite tunes. A heavy\nsigh, which she tried vainly to repress, burst from her lips. \"Oh,\" she\nthought, \"I had forgotten these old friends! How shall we part from them\nwhen the time comes!\"\n\n\"May I inquire, Miss Vanstone, whether you and your sister have formed\nany definite plans for the future?\" asked Mr. Pendril. \"Have you thought\nof any place of residence?\"\n\n\"I may take it on myself, sir,\" said Miss Garth, \"to answer your\nquestion for them. When they leave this house, they leave it with me. My\nhome is their home, and my bread is their bread. Their parents honored\nme, trusted me, and loved me. For twelve happy years they never let me\nremember that I was their governess; they only let me know myself as\ntheir companion and their friend. My memory of them is the memory of\nunvarying gentleness and generosity; and my life shall pay the debt of\nmy gratitude to their orphan children.\"\n\nNorah rose hastily from the sofa; Magdalen impetuously left the window.\nFor once, there was no contrast in the conduct of the sisters. For once,\nthe same impulse moved their hearts, the same earnest feeling inspired\ntheir words. Miss Garth waited until the first outburst of emotion had\npassed away; then rose, and, taking Norah and Magdalen each by the hand,\naddressed herself to Mr. Pendril and Mr. Clare. She spoke with perfect\nself-possession; strong in her artless unconsciousness of her own good\naction.\n\n\"Even such a trifle as my own story,\" she said, \"is of some importance\nat such a moment as this. I wish you both, gentlemen, to understand that\nI am not promising more to the daughters of your old friend than I\ncan perform. When I first came to this house, I entered it under such\nindependent circumstances as are not common in the lives of governesses.\nIn my younger days, I was associated in teaching with my elder sister:\nwe established a school in London, which grew to be a large and\nprosperous one. I only left it, and became a private governess, because\nthe heavy responsibility of the school was more than my strength\ncould bear. I left my share in the profits untouched, and I possess a\npecuniary interest in our establishment to this day. That is my story,\nin few words. When we leave this house, I propose that we shall go back\nto the school in London, which is still prosperously directed by my\nelder sister. We can live there as quietly as we please, until time\nhas helped us to bear our affliction better than we can bear it now. If\nNorah's and Magdalen's altered prospects oblige them to earn their own\nindependence, I can help them to earn it, as a gentleman's daughters\nshould. The best families in this land are glad to ask my sister's\nadvice where the interests of their children's home-training are\nconcerned; and I answer, beforehand, for her hearty desire to serve Mr.\nVanstone's daughters, as I answer for my own. That is the future which\nmy gratitude to their father and mother, and my love for themselves,\nnow offers to them. If you think my proposal, gentlemen, a fit and fair\nproposal--and I see in your faces that you do--let us not make the\nhard necessities of our position harder still, by any useless delay in\nmeeting them at once. Let us do what we must do; let us act on Norah's\ndecision, and leave this house to-morrow. You mentioned the servants\njust now, Mr. Pendril: I am ready to call them together in the next\nroom, and to assist you in the settlement of their claims, whenever you\nplease.\"\n\nWithout waiting for the lawyer's answer, without leaving the sisters\ntime to realize their own terrible situation, she moved at once toward\nthe door. It was her wise resolution to meet the coming trial by doing\nmuch and saying little. Before she could leave the room, Mr. Clare\nfollowed, and stopped her on the threshold.\n\n\"I never envied a woman's feelings before,\" said the old man. \"It may\nsurprise you to hear it; but I envy yours. Wait! I have something more\nto say. There is an obstacle still left--the everlasting obstacle of\nFrank. Help me to sweep him off. Take the elder sister along with you\nand the lawyer, and leave me here to have it out with the younger. I\nwant to see what metal she's really made of.\"\n\nWhile Mr. Clare was addressing these words to Miss Garth, Mr. Pendril\nhad taken the opportunity of speaking to Norah. \"Before I go back to\ntown,\" he said, \"I should like to have a word with you in private. From\nwhat has passed today, Miss Vanstone, I have formed a very high opinion\nof your discretion; and, as an old friend of your father's, I want to\ntake the freedom of speaking to you about your sister.\"\n\nBefore Norah could answer, she was summoned, in compliance with Mr.\nClare's request, to the conference with the servants. Mr. Pendril\nfollowed Miss Garth, as a matter of course. When the three were out in\nthe hall, Mr. Clare re-entered the room, closed the door, and signed\nperemptorily to Magdalen to take a chair.\n\nShe obeyed him in silence. He took a turn up and down the room, with his\nhands in the side-pockets of the long, loose, shapeless coat which he\nhabitually wore.\n\n\"How old are you?\" he said, stopping suddenly, and speaking to her with\nthe whole breadth of the room between them.\n\n\"I was eighteen last birthday,\" she answered, humbly, without looking up\nat him.\n\n\"You have shown extraordinary courage for a girl of eighteen. Have you\ngot any of that courage left?\"\n\nShe clasped her hands together, and wrung them hard. A few tears\ngathered in her eyes, and rolled slowly over her cheeks.\n\n\"I can't give Frank up,\" she said, faintly. \"You don't care for me, I\nknow; but you used to care for my father. Will you try to be kind to me\nfor my father's sake?\"\n\nThe last words died away in a whisper; she could say no more. Never\nhad she felt the illimitable power which a woman's love possesses of\nabsorbing into itself every other event, every other joy or sorrow of\nher life, as she felt it then. Never had she so tenderly associated\nFrank with the memory of her lost parents, as at that moment. Never had\nthe impenetrable atmosphere of illusion through which women behold the\nman of their choice--the atmosphere which had blinded her to all that\nwas weak, selfish, and mean in Frank's nature--surrounded him with a\nbrighter halo than now, when she was pleading with the father for the\npossession of the son. \"Oh, don't ask me to give him up!\" she said,\ntrying to take courage, and shuddering from head to foot. In the next\ninstant, she flew to the opposite extreme, with the suddenness of a\nflash of lightning. \"I won't give him up!\" she burst out violently. \"No!\nnot if a thousand fathers ask me!\"\n\n\"I am one father,\" said Mr. Clare. \"And I don't ask you.\"\n\nIn the first astonishment and delight of hearing those unexpected words,\nshe started to her feet, crossed the room, and tried to throw her arms\nround his neck. She might as well have attempted to move the house from\nits foundations. He took her by the shoulders and put her back in her\nchair. His inexorable eyes looked her into submission; and his lean\nforefinger shook at her warningly, as if he was quieting a fractious\nchild.\n\n\"Hug Frank,\" he said; \"don't hug me. I haven't done with you yet; when\nI have, you may shake hands with me, if you like. Wait, and compose\nyourself.\"\n\nHe left her. His hands went back into his pockets, and his monotonous\nmarch up and down the room began again.\n\n\"Ready?\" he asked, stopping short after a while. She tried to answer.\n\"Take two minutes more,\" he said, and resumed his walk with the\nregularity of clock-work. \"These are the creatures,\" he thought to\nhimself, \"into whose keeping men otherwise sensible give the happiness\nof their lives. Is there any other object in creation, I wonder, which\nanswers its end as badly as a woman does?\"\n\nHe stopped before her once more. Her breathing was easier; the dark\nflush on her face was dying out again.\n\n\"Ready?\" he repeated. \"Yes; ready at last. Listen to me; and let's get\nit over. I don't ask you to give Frank up. I ask you to wait.\"\n\n\"I will wait,\" she said. \"Patiently, willingly.\"\n\n\"Will you make Frank wait?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Will you send him to China?\"\n\nHer head drooped upon her bosom, and she clasped her hands again, in\nsilence. Mr. Clare saw where the difficulty lay, and marched straight up\nto it on the spot.\n\n\"I don't pretend to enter into your feelings for Frank, or Frank's for\nyou,\" he said. \"The subject doesn't interest me. But I _do_ pretend to\nstate two plain truths. It is one plain truth that you can't be married\ntill you have money enough to pay for the roof that shelters you, the\nclothes that cover you, and the victuals you eat. It is another plain\ntruth that you can't find the money; that I can't find the money; and\nthat Frank's only chance of finding it, is going to China. If I tell him\nto go, he'll sit in a corner and cry. If I insist, he'll say Yes, and\ndeceive me. If I go a step further, and see him on board ship with my\nown eyes, he'll slip off in the pilot's boat, and sneak back secretly to\nyou. That's his disposition.\"\n\n\"No!\" said Magdalen. \"It's not his disposition; it's his love for Me.\"\n\n\"Call it what you like,\" retorted Mr. Clare. \"Sneak or Sweetheart\n--he's too slippery, in either capacity, for my fingers to hold him.\nMy shutting the door won't keep him from coming back. Your shutting the\ndoor will. Have you the courage to shut it? Are you fond enough of him\nnot to stand in his light?\"\n\n\"Fond! I would die for him!\"\n\n\"Will you send him to China?\"\n\nShe sighed bitterly.\n\n\"Have a little pity for me,\" she said. \"I have lost my father; I have\nlost my mother; I have lost my fortune--and now I am to lose Frank. You\ndon't like women, I know; but try to help me with a little pity. I don't\nsay it's not for his own interests to send him to China; I only say it's\nhard--very, very hard on _me_.\"\n\nMr. Clare had been deaf to her violence, insensible to her caresses,\nblind to her tears; but under the tough integument of his philosophy\nhe had a heart--and it answered that hopeless appeal; it felt those\ntouching words.\n\n\"I don't deny that your case is a hard one,\" he said. \"I don't want to\nmake it harder. I only ask you to do in Frank's interests what Frank\nis too weak to do for himself. It's no fault of yours; it's no fault\nof mine--but it's not the less true that the fortune you were to have\nbrought him has changed owners.\"\n\nShe suddenly looked up, with a furtive light in her eyes, with a\nthreatening smile on her lips.\n\n\"It may change owners again,\" she said.\n\nMr. Clare saw the alteration in her expression, and heard the tones of\nher voice. But the words were spoken low; spoken as if to herself--they\nfailed to reach him across the breadth of the room. He stopped instantly\nin his walk and asked what she had said.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she answered, turning her head away toward the window, and\nlooking out mechanically at the falling rain. \"Only my own thoughts.\"\n\nMr. Clare resumed his walk, and returned to his subject.\n\n\"It's your interest,\" he went on, \"as well as Frank's interest, that he\nshould go. He may make money enough to marry you in China; he can't make\nit here. If he stops at home, he'll be the ruin of both of you. He'll\nshut his eyes to every consideration of prudence, and pester you to\nmarry him; and when he has carried his point, he will be the first to\nturn round afterward and complain that you're a burden on him. Hear me\nout! You're in love with Frank--I'm not, and I know him. Put you two\ntogether often enough; give him time enough to hug, cry, pester, and\nplead; and I'll tell you what the end will be--you'll marry him.\"\n\nHe had touched the right string at last. It rung back in answer before\nhe could add another word.\n\n\"You don't know me,\" she said, firmly. \"You don't know what I can suffer\nfor Frank's sake. He shall never marry me till I can be what my father\nsaid I should be--the making of his fortune. He shall take no burden,\nwhen he takes me; I promise you that! I'll be the good angel of Frank's\nlife; I'll not go a penniless girl to him, and drag him down.\" She\nabruptly left her seat, advanced a few steps toward Mr. Clare, and\nstopped in the middle of the room. Her arms fell helpless on either side\nof her, and she burst into tears. \"He shall go,\" she said. \"If my heart\nbreaks in doing it, I'll tell him to-morrow that we must say Good-by!\"\n\nMr. Clare at once advanced to meet her, and held out his hand.\n\n\"I'll help you,\" he said. \"Frank shall hear every word that has passed\nbetween us. When he comes to-morrow he shall know, beforehand, that he\ncomes to say Good-by.\"\n\nShe took his hand in both her own--hesitated--looked at him--and\npressed it to her bosom. \"May I ask a favor of you, before you go?\"\nshe said, timidly. He tried to take his hand from her; but she knew her\nadvantage, and held it fast. \"Suppose there should be some change for\nthe better?\" she went on. \"Sup pose I could come to Frank, as my fat her\nsaid I should come to him--?\"\n\nBefore she could complete the question, Mr. Clare made a second effort\nand withdrew his hand. \"As your father said you should come to him?\" he\nrepeated, looking at her attentively.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Strange things happen sometimes. If strange things\nhappen to me will you let Frank come back before the five years are\nout?\"\n\nWhat did she mean? Was she clinging desperately to the hope of melting\nMichael Vanstone's heart? Mr. Clare could draw no other conclusion from\nwhat she had just said to him. At the beginning of the interview he\nwould have roughly dispelled her delusion. At the end of the interview\nhe left her compassionately in possession of it.\n\n\"You are hoping against all hope,\" he said; \"but if it gives you\ncourage, hope on. If this impossible good fortune of yours ever happens,\ntell me, and Frank shall come back. In the meantime--\"\n\n\"In the meantime,\" she interposed sadly, \"you have my promise.\"\n\nOnce more Mr. Clare's sharp eyes searched her face attentively.\n\n\"I will trust your promise,\" he said. \"You shall see Frank to-morrow.\"\n\nShe went back thoughtfully to her chair, and sat down again in silence.\nMr. Clare made for the door before any formal leave-taking could pass\nbetween them. \"Deep!\" he thought to himself, as he looked back at her\nbefore he went out; \"only eighteen; and too deep for my sounding!\"\n\nIn the hall he found Norah, waiting anxiously to hear what had happened.\n\n\"Is it all over?\" she asked. \"Does Frank go to China?\"\n\n\"Be careful how you manage that sister of yours,\" said Mr. Clare,\nwithout noticing the question. \"She has one great misfortune to contend\nwith: she's not made for the ordinary jog-trot of a woman's life. I\ndon't say I can see straight to the end of the good or evil in her--I\nonly warn you, her future will be no common one.\"\n\n\nAn hour later, Mr. Pendril left the house; and, by that night's post,\nMiss Garth dispatched a letter to her sister in London.\n\nTHE END OF THE FIRST SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\n\nI.\n\n_From Norah Vanstone to Mr. Pendril._\n\n\"Westmoreland House, Kensington,\n\n\"August 14th, 1846.\n\n\"DEAR MR. PENDRIL--The date of this letter will show you that the last\nof many hard partings is over. We have left Combe-Raven; we have said\nfarewell to home.\n\n\"I have been thinking seriously of what you said to me on Wednesday,\nbefore you went back to town. I entirely agree with you that Miss Garth\nis more shaken by all she has gone through for our sakes than she is\nherself willing to admit; and that it is my duty, for the future, to\nspare her all the anxiety that I can on the subject of my sister and\nmyself. This is very little to do for our dearest friend, for our second\nmother. Such as it is, I will do it with all my heart.\n\n\"But, forgive me for saying that I am as far as ever from agreeing with\nyou about Magdalen. I am so sensible, in our helpless position, of the\nimportance of your assistance; so anxious to be worthy of the interest\nof my father's trusted adviser and oldest friend, that I feel really\nand truly disappointed with myself for differing with you--and yet I do\ndiffer. Magdalen is very strange, very unaccountable, to those who don't\nknow her intimately. I can understand that she has innocently misled\nyou; and that she has presented herself, perhaps, under her least\nfavorable aspect. But that the clew to her language and her conduct on\nWednesday last is to be found in such a feeling toward the man who has\nruined us, as the feeling at which you hinted, is what I can not and\nwill not believe of my sister. If you knew, as I do, what a noble nature\nshe has, you would not be surprised at this obstinate resistance of mine\nto your opinion. Will you try to alter it? I don't mind what Mr. Clare\nsays; he believes in nothing. But I attach a very serious importance to\nwhat _you_ say; and, kind as I know your motives to be, it distresses me\nto think you are doing Magdalen an injustice.\n\n\"Having relieved my mind of this confession, I may now come to the\nproper object of my letter. I promised, if you could not find leisure\ntime to visit us to-day, to write and tell you all that happened after\nyou left us. The day has passed without our seeing you. So I open my\nwriting-case and perform my promise.\n\n\"I am sorry to say that three of the women-servants--the house-maid, the\nkitchen-maid, and even our own maid (to whom I am sure we have always\nbeen kind)--took advantage of your having paid them their wages to pack\nup and go as soon as your back was turned. They came to say good-by with\nas much ceremony and as little feeling as if they were leaving the house\nunder ordinary circumstances. The cook, for all her violent temper,\nbehaved very differently: she sent up a message to say that she would\nstop and help us to the last. And Thomas (who has never yet been in any\nother place than ours) spoke so gratefully of my dear father's unvarying\nkindness to him, and asked so anxiously to be allowed to go on serving\nus while his little savings lasted, that Magdalen and I forgot all\nformal considerations and both shook hands with him. The poor lad went\nout of the room crying. I wish him well; I hope he will find a kind\nmaster and a good place.\n\n\"The long, quiet, rainy evening out-of-doors--our last evening at\nCombe-Raven--was a sad trial to us. I think winter-time would have\nweighed less on our spirits; the drawn curtains and the bright lamps,\nand the companionable fires would have helped us. We were only five in\nthe house altogether--after having once been so many! I can't tell you\nhow dreary the gray daylight looked, toward seven o'clock, in the lonely\nrooms, and on the noiseless staircase. Surely, the prejudice in favor of\nlong summer evenings is the prejudice of happy people? We did our best.\nWe kept ourselves employed, and Miss Garth helped us. The prospect of\npreparing for our departure, which had seemed so dreadful earlier in the\nday, altered into the prospect of a refuge from ourselves as the evening\ncame on. We each tried at first to pack up in our own rooms--but the\nloneliness was more than we could bear. We carried all our possessions\ndownstairs, and heaped them on the large dining-table, and so made our\npreparations together in the same room. I am sure we have taken nothing\naway which does not properly belong to us.\n\n\"Having already mentioned to you my own conviction that Magdalen was not\nherself when you saw her on Wednesday, I feel tempted to stop here and\ngive you an instance in proof of what I say. The little circumstance\nhappened on Wednesday night, just before we went up to our rooms.\n\n\"After we had packed our dresses and our birthday presents, our books\nand our music, we began to sort our letters, which had got confused from\nbeing placed on the table together. Some of my letters were mixed with\nMagdalen's, and some of hers with mine. Among these last I found a card,\nwhich had been given to my sister early in the year by an actor who\nmanaged an amateur theatrical performance in which she took a part.\nThe man had given her the card, containing his name and address, in the\nbelief that she would be invited to many more amusements of the same\nkind, and in the hope that she would recommend him as a superintendent\non future occasions. I only relate these trifling particulars to show\nyou how little worth keeping such a card could be, in such circumstances\nas ours. Naturally enough, I threw it away from me across the table,\nmeaning to throw it on the floor. It fell short, close to the place\nin which Magdalen was sitting. She took it up, looked at it, and\nimmediately declared that she would not have had this perfectly\nworthless thing destroyed for the world. She was almost angry with me\nfor having thrown it away; almost angry with Miss Garth for asking what\nshe could possibly want with it! Could there be any plainer proof than\nthis that our misfortunes--falling so much more heavily on her than\non me--have quite unhinged her, and worn her out? Surely her words\nand looks are not to be interpreted against her, when she is not\nsufficiently mistress of herself to exert her natural judgment--when\nshe shows the unreasonable petulance of a child on a question which is\nnot of the slightest importance.\n\n\"A little after eleven we went upstairs to try if we could get some\nrest.\n\n\"I drew aside the curtain of my window and looked out. Oh, what a cruel\nlast night it was: no moon, no stars; such deep darkness that not one\nof the dear familiar objects in the garden was visible when I looked\nfor them; such deep stillness that even my own movements about the room\nalmost frightened me! I tried to lie down and sleep, but the sense of\nloneliness came again and quite overpowered me. You will say I am old\nenough, at six-and-twenty, to have exerted more control over myself. I\nhardly know how it happened, but I stole into Magdalen's room, just as\nI used to steal into it years and years ago, when we were children. She\nwas not in bed; she was sitting with her writing materials before her,\nthinking. I said I wanted to be with her the last night; and she kissed\nme, and told me to lie down, and promised soon to follow me. My mind was\na little quieted and I fell asleep. It was daylight when I woke--and the\nfirst sight I saw was Magdalen, still sitting in the chair, and still\nthinking. She had never been to bed; she had not slept all through the\nnight.\n\n\"'I shall sleep when we have left Combe-Raven,' she said. 'I shall be\nbetter when it is all over, and I have bid Frank good-by.' She had in\nher hand our father's will, and the letter he wrote to you; and when she\nhad done speaking, she gave them into my possession. I was the eldest\n(she said), and those last precious relics ought to be in my keeping.\nI tried to propose to her that we should divide them; but she shook her\nhead. 'I have copied for myself,' was her answer, 'all that he says of\nus in the will, and all that he says in the letter.' She told me this,\nand took from her bosom a tiny white silk bag, which she had made in the\nnight, and in which she had put the extracts, so as to keep them always\nabout her. 'This tells me in his own words what his last wishes were for\nboth of us,' she said; 'and this is all I want for the future.'\n\n\"These are trifles to dwell on; and I am almost surprised at myself for\nnot feeling ashamed to trouble you with them. But, since I have known\nwhat your early connection was with my father and mother, I have learned\nto think of you (and, I suppose, to write to you) as an old friend. And,\nbesides, I have it so much at heart to change your opinion of Magdalen,\nthat I can't help telling you the smallest things about her which may,\nin my judgment, end in making you think of her as I do.\n\n\"When breakfast-time came (on Thursday morning), we were surprised to\nfind a strange letter on the table. Perhaps I ought to mention it to\nyou, in case of any future necessity for your interference. It was\naddressed to Miss Garth, on paper with the deepest mourning-border round\nit; and the writer was the same man who followed us on our way home from\na walk one day last spring--Captain Wragge. His object appears to be to\nassert once more his audacious claim to a family connection with my poor\nmother, under cover of a letter of condolence; which it is an\ninsolence in such a person to have written at all. He expresses as much\nsympathy--on his discovery of our affliction in the newspaper--as if he\nhad been really intimate with us; and he begs to know, in a postscript\n(being evidently in total ignorance of all that has really happened),\nwhether it is thought desirable that he should be present, among the\nother relatives, at the reading of the will! The address he gives, at\nwhich letters will reach him for the next fortnight, is, 'Post-office,\nBirmingham.' This is all I have to tell you on the subject. Both the\nletter and the writer seem to me to be equally unworthy of the slightest\nnotice, on our part or on yours.\n\n\"After breakfast Magdalen left us, and went by herself into the\nmorning-room. The weather being still showery, we had arranged that\nFrancis Clare should see her in that room, when he presented himself to\ntake his leave. I was upstairs when he came; and I remained upstairs\nfor more than half an hour afterward, sadly anxious, as you may well\nbelieve, on Magdalen's account.\n\n\"At the end of the half-hour or more, I came downstairs. As I reached\nthe landing I suddenly heard her voice, raised entreatingly, and calling\non him by his name--then loud sobs--then a frightful laughing and\nscreaming, both together, that rang through the house. I instantly ran\ninto the room, and found Magdalen on the sofa in violent hysterics, and\nFrank standing staring at her, with a lowering, angry face, biting his\nnails.\n\n\"I felt so indignant--without knowing plainly why, for I was ignorant,\nof course, of what had passed at the interview--that I took Mr. Francis\nClare by the shoulders and pushed him out of the room. I am careful\nto tell you how I acted toward him, and what led to it; because I\nunderstand that he is excessively offended with me, and that he is\nlikely to mention elsewhere what he calls my unladylike violence toward\nhim. If he should mention it to you, I am anxious to acknowledge, of my\nown accord, that I forgot myself--not, I hope you will think, without\nsome provocation.\n\n\"I pushed him into the hall, leaving Magdalen, for the moment, to Miss\nGarth's care. Instead of going away, he sat down sulkily on one of the\nhall chairs. 'May I ask the reason of this extraordinary violence?' he\ninquired, with an injured look. 'No,' I said. 'You will be good enough\nto imagine the reason for yourself, and to leave us immediately, if you\nplease.' He sat doggedly in the chair, biting his nails and considering.\n'What have I done to be treated in this unfeeling manner?' he asked,\nafter a while. 'I can enter into no discussion with you,' I answered;\n'I can only request you to leave us. If you persist in waiting to see\nmy sister again, I will go to the cottage myself and appeal to your\nfather.' He got up in a great hurry at those words. 'I have been\ninfamously used in this business,' he said. 'All the hardships and the\nsacrifices have fallen to my share. I'm the only one among you who has\nany heart: all the rest are as hard as stones--Magdalen included. In\none breath she says she loves me, and in another she tells me to go to\nChina. What have I done to be treated with this heartless inconsistency?\nI am consistent myself--I only want to stop at home--and (what's the\nconsequence?) you're all against me!' In that manner he grumbled his way\ndown the steps, and so I saw the last of him. This was all that passed\nbetween us. If he gives you any other account of it, what he says will\nbe false. He made no attempt to return. An hour afterward his father\ncame alone to say good-by. He saw Miss Garth and me, but not Magdalen;\nand he told us he would take the necessary measures, with your\nassistance, for having his son properly looked after in London, and seen\nsafely on board the vessel when the time came. It was a short visit, and\na sad leave-taking. Even Mr. Clare was sorry, though he tried hard to\nhide it.\n\n\"We had barely two hours, after Mr. Clare had left us, before it would\nbe time to go. I went back to Magdalen, and found her quieter and\nbetter, though terribly pale and exhausted, and oppressed, as I fancied,\nby thoughts which she could not prevail on herself to communicate.\nShe would tell me nothing then--she has told me nothing since--of what\npassed between herself and Francis Clare. When I spoke of him angrily\n(feeling as I did that he had distressed and tortured her, when she\nought to have had all the encouragement and comfort from him that man\ncould give), she refused to hear me: she made the kindest allowances\nand the sweetest excuses for him, and laid all the blame of the dreadful\nstate in which I had found her entirely on herself. Was I wrong in\ntelling you that she had a noble nature? And won't you alter your\nopinion when you read these lines?\n\n\"We had no friends to come and bid us good-by; and our few acquaintances\nwere too far from us--perhaps too indifferent about us--to call. We\nemployed the little leisure left in going over the house together for\nthe last time. We took leave of our old schoolroom, our bedrooms, the\nroom where our mother died, the little study where our father used to\nsettle his accounts and write his letters--feeling toward them, in our\nforlorn condition, as other girls might have felt at parting with old\nfriends. From the house, in a gleam of fine weather, we went into the\ngarden, and gathered our last nosegay; with the purpose of drying the\nflowers when they begin to wither, and keeping them in remembrance of\nthe happy days that are gone. When we had said good-by to the garden,\nthere was only half an hour left. We went together to the grave; we\nknelt down, side by side, in silence, and kissed the sacred ground. I\nthought my heart would have broken. August was the month of my mother's\nbirthday; and, this time last year, my father and Magdalen and I were\nall consulting in secret what present we could make to surprise her with\non the birthday morning.\n\n\"If you had seen how Magdalen suffered, you would never doubt her again.\nI had to take her from the last resting-place of our father and mother\nalmost by force. Before we were out of the churchyard she broke from\nme and ran back. She dropped on her knees at the grave; tore up from it\npassionately a handful of grass; and said something to herself, at the\nsame moment, which, though I followed her instantly, I did not get near\nenough to hear. She turned on me in such a frenzied manner, when I\ntried to raise her from the ground--she looked at me with such a fearful\nwildness in her eyes--that I felt absolutely terrified at the sight of\nher. To my relief, the paroxysm left her as suddenly as it had come. She\nthrust away the tuft of grass into the bosom of her dress, and took my\narm and hurried with me out of the churchyard. I asked her why she had\ngone back--I asked what those words were which she had spoken at the\ngrave. 'A promise to our dead father,' she answered, with a momentary\nreturn of the wild look and the frenzied manner which had startled me\nalready. I was afraid to agitate her by saying more; I left all\nother questions to be asked at a fitter and a quieter time. You will\nunderstand from this how terribly she suffers, how wildly and strangely\nshe acts under violent agitation; and you will not interpret against her\nwhat she said or did when you saw her on Wednesday last.\n\n\"We only returned to the house in time to hasten away from it to the\ntrain. Perhaps it was better for us so--better that we had only a\nmoment left to look back before the turn in the road hid the last of\nCombe-Raven from our view. There was not a soul we knew at the station;\nnobody to stare at us, nobody to wish us good-by. The rain came on again\nas we took our seats in the train. What we felt at the sight of the\nrailway--what horrible remembrances it forced on our minds of the\ncalamity which has made us fatherless--I cannot, and dare not, tell you.\nI have tried anxiously not to write this letter in a gloomy tone; not\nto return all your kindness to us by distressing you with our grief.\nPerhaps I have dwelt too long already on the little story of our parting\nfrom home? I can only say, in excuse, that my heart is full of it; and\nwhat is not in my heart my pen won't write.\n\n\"We have been so short a time in our new abode that I have nothing more\nto tell you--except that Miss Garth's sister has received us with the\nheartiest kindness. She considerately leaves us to ourselves, until we\nare fitter than we are now to think of our future plans, and to arrange\nas we best can for earning our own living. The house is so large, and\nthe position of our rooms has been so thoughtfully chosen, that I should\nhardly know--except when I hear the laughing of the younger girls in the\ngarden--that we were living in a school.\n\n\"With kindest and best wishes from Miss Garth and my sister, believe me,\ndear Mr. Pendril, gratefully yours,\n\n\"NORAH VANSTONE.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n_From Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril._\n\n\"Westmoreland House, Kensington,\n\n\"September 23d, 1846.\n\n\"MY DEAR SIR--I write these lines in such misery of mind as no words can\ndescribe. Magdalen has deserted us. At an early hour this morning she\nsecretly left the house, and she has not been heard of since.\n\n\"I would come and speak to you personally; but I dare not leave Norah. I\nmust try to control myself; I must try to write.\n\n\"Nothing happened yesterday to prepare me or to prepare Norah for this\nlast--I had almost said, this worst--of all our afflictions. The only\nalteration we either of us noticed in the unhappy girl was an alteration\nfor the better when we parted for the night. She kissed me, which she\nhas not done latterly; and she burst out crying when she embraced her\nsister next. We had so little suspicion of the truth that we thought\nthese signs of renewed tenderness and affection a promise of better\nthings for the future.\n\n\"This morning, when her sister went into her room, it was empty, and\na note in her handwriting, addressed to Norah, was lying on the\ndressing-table. I cannot prevail on Norah to part with the note; I can\nonly send you the inclosed copy of it. You will see that it affords no\nclew to the direction she has taken.\n\n\"Knowing the value of time, in this dreadful emergency, I examined her\nroom, and (with my sister's help) questioned the servants immediately on\nthe news of her absence reaching me. Her wardrobe was empty; and all her\nboxes but one, which she has evidently taken away with her, are empty,\ntoo. We are of opinion that she has privately turned her dresses and\njewelry into money; that she had the one trunk she took with her removed\nfrom the house yesterday; and that she left us this morning on foot.\nThe answers given by one of the servants are so unsatisfactory that we\nbelieve the woman has been bribed to assist her; and has managed all\nthose arrangements for her flight which she could not have safely\nundertaken by herself.\n\n\"Of the immediate object with which she has left us, I entertain no\ndoubt.\n\n\"I have reasons (which I can tell you at a fitter time) for feeling\nassured that she has gone away with the intention of trying her\nfortune on the stage. She has in her possession the card of an actor\nby profession, who superintended an amateur theatrical performance at\nClifton, in which she took part; and to him she has gone to help her.\nI saw the card at the time, and I know the actor's name to be Huxtable.\nThe address I cannot call to mind quite so correctly; but I am almost\nsure it was at some theatrical place in Bow Street, Covent Garden. Let\nme entreat you not to lose a moment in sending to make the necessary\ninquiries; the first trace of her will, I firmly believe, be found at\nthat address.\n\n\"If we had nothing worse to dread than her attempting to go on the\nstage, I should not feel the distress and dismay which now overpower me.\nHundreds of other girls have acted as recklessly as she has acted, and\nhave not ended ill after all. But my fears for Magdalen do not begin and\nend with the risk she is running at present.\n\n\"There has been something weighing on her mind ever since we left\nCombe-Raven--weighing far more heavily for the last six weeks than at\nfirst. Until the period when Francis Clare left England, I am persuaded\nshe was secretly sustained by the hope that he would contrive to see her\nagain. From the day when she knew that the measures you had taken for\npreventing this had succeeded; from the day when she was assured that\nthe ship had really taken him away, nothing has roused, nothing has\ninterested her. She has given herself up, more and more hopelessly, to\nher own brooding thoughts; thoughts which I believe first entered\nher mind on the day when the utter ruin of the prospects on which her\nmarriage depended was made known to her. She has formed some desperate\nproject of contesting the possession of her father's fortune with\nMichael Vanstone; and the stage career which she has gone away to try is\nnothing more than a means of freeing herself from all home dependence,\nand of enabling her to run what mad risks she pleases, in perfect\nsecurity from all home control. What it costs me to write of her in\nthese terms, I must leave you to imagine. The time has gone by when\nany consideration of distress to my own feelings can weigh with me.\nWhatever I can say which will open your eyes to the real danger, and\nstrengthen your conviction of the instant necessity of averting it, I\nsay in despite of myself, without hesitation and without reserve.\n\n\"One word more, and I have done.\n\n\"The last time you were so good as to come to this house, do you\nremember how Magdalen embarrassed and distressed us by questioning\nyou about her right to bear her father's name? Do you remember her\npersisting in her inquiries, until she had forced you to acknowledge\nthat, legally speaking, she and her sister had No Name? I venture to\nremind you of this, because you have the affairs of hundreds of clients\nto think of, and you might well have forgotten the circumstance.\nWhatever natural reluctance she might otherwise have had to deceiving\nus, and degrading herself, by the use of an assumed name, that\nconversation with you is certain to have removed. We must discover her\nby personal description--we can trace her in no other way.\n\n\"I can think of nothing more to guide your decision in our deplorable\nemergency. For God's sake, let no expense and no efforts be spared. My\nletter ought to reach you by ten o'clock this morning, at the latest.\nLet me have one line in answer, to say you will act instantly for\nthe best. My only hope of quieting Norah is to show her a word of\nencouragement from your pen.

I have struggled against myself till I\nam worn out in the effort. I am the wretchedest of living creatures. Our\nquiet life here maddens me; I can bear it no longer; I must go. If you\nknew what my thoughts are; if you knew how hard I have fought against\nthem, and how horribly they have gone on haunting me in the lonely quiet\nof this house, you would pity and forgive me.

I\nhave no position to lose, and no name to degrade. Don't doubt I love\nyou--don't let Miss Garth doubt my gratitude. I go away miserable at\nleaving you; but I must go.

I went\nto your office to speak to you about the matter to-day. Not having found\nyou, and not being able to return and try again to-morrow, I write these\nlines to save delay, and to tell you how we stand thus far.\n\n\"I am sorry to say, no advance has been made since my former report.\nThe trace of the young lady which we found nearly a week since, still\nremains the last trace discovered of her. This case seems a mighty\nsimple one looked at from a distance. Looked at close, it alters very\nconsiderably for the worse, and becomes, to speak the plain truth--a\nPoser.\n\n\"This is how we now stand:\n\n\"We have traced the young lady to the theatrical agent's in Bow Street.\nWe know that at an early hour on the morning of the twenty-third the\nagent was called downstairs, while he was dressing, to speak to a\nyoung lady in a cab at the door. We know that, on her production of Mr.\nHuxtable's card, he wrote on it Mr. Huxtable's address in the country,\nand heard her order the cabman to drive to the Great Northern terminus.\nWe believe she left by the nine o'clock train. We followed her by the\ntwelve o'clock train. We have ascertained that she called at half-past\ntwo at Mr. Huxtable's lodgings; that she found he was away, and not\nexpected back till eight in the evening; that she left word she would\ncall again at eight; and that she never returned. Mr. Huxtable's\nstatement is--he and the young lady have never set eyes on each other.\nThe first consideration which follows, is this: Are we to believe Mr.\nHuxtable? I have carefully inquired into his character; I know as much,\nor more, about him than he knows about himself; and my opinion is, that\nwe _are_ to believe him. To the best of my knowledge, he is a perfectly\nhonest man.\n\n\"Here, then, is the hitch in the case. The young lady sets out with a\ncertain object before her. Instead of going on to the accomplishment\nof that object, she stops short of it. Why has she stopped? and where?\nThose are, unfortunately, just the questions which we can't answer yet.\n\n\"My own opinion of the matter is, briefly, as follows: I don't think she\nhas met with any serious accident. Serious accidents, in nine cases out\nof ten, discover themselves. My own notion is, that she has fallen into\nthe hands of some person or persons interested in hiding her away,\nand sharp enough to know how to set about it. Whether she is in their\ncharge, with or without her own consent, is more than I can undertake to\nsay at present. I don't wish to raise false hopes or false fears; I wish\nto stop short at the opinion I have given already.\n\n\"In regard to the future, I may tell you that I have left one of my men\nin daily communication with the authorities. I have also taken care to\nhave the handbills offering a reward for the discovery of her widely\ncirculated. Lastly, I have completed the necessary arrangements for\nseeing the play-bills of all country theaters, and for having the\ndramatic companies well looked after. Some years since, this would have\ncost a serious expenditure of time and money. Luckily for our purpose,\nthe country theaters are in a bad way. Excepting the large cities,\nhardly one of them is open, and we can keep our eye on them, with little\nexpense and less difficulty.\n\n\"These are the steps which I think it needful to take at present. If you\nare of another opinion, you have only to give me your directions, and I\nwill carefully attend to the same. I don't by any means despair of our\nfinding the young lady and bringing her back to her friends safe and\nwell. Please to tell them so; and allow me to subscribe myself, yours\nrespectfully,\n\n\"ABRAHAM BULMER.\"\n\nV.\n\n_Anonymous Letter addressed to Mr. Pendril._\n\n\"SIR--A word to the wise. The friends of a certain young lady are\nwasting time and money to no purpose. Your confidential clerk and your\ndetective policeman are looking for a needle in a bottle of hay.

The postern by\nwhich Skeldergate was formerly approached no longer exists; and the few\nold houses left in the street are disguised in melancholy modern\ncostume of whitewash and cement. Shops of the smaller and poorer order,\nintermixed here and there with dingy warehouses and joyless private\nresidences of red brick, compose the present a spect of Skeldergate. On\nthe river-side the houses are separated at intervals by lanes running\ndown to the water, and disclosing lonely little plots of open ground,\nwith the masts of sailing-barges rising beyond. At its southward\nextremity the street ceases on a sudden, and the broad flow of the Ouse,\nthe trees, the meadows, the public-walk on one bank and the towing-path\non the other, open to view.\n\nHere, where the street ends, and on the side of it furthest from the\nriver, a narrow little lane leads up to the paved footway surmounting\nthe ancient Walls of York. The one small row of buildings, which is all\nthat the lane possesses, is composed of cheap lodging-houses, with\nan opposite view, at the distance of a few feet, of a portion of the\nmassive city wall. This place is called Rosemary Lane. Very little\nlight enters it; very few people live in it; the floating population of\nSkeldergate passes it by; and visitors to the Walk on the Walls, who use\nit as the way up or the way down, get out of the dreary little passage\nas fast as they can.\n\nThe door of one of the houses in this lost corner of York opened softly\non the evening of the twenty-third of September, eighteen hundred and\nforty-six; and a solitary individual of the male sex sauntered into\nSkeldergate from the seclusion of Rosemary Lane.\n\nTurning northward, this person directed his steps toward the bridge\nover the Ouse and the busy center of the city. He bore the external\nappearance of respectable poverty; he carried a gingham umbrella,\npreserved in an oilskin case; he picked his steps, with the neatest\navoidance of all dirty places on the pavement; and he surveyed the scene\naround him with eyes of two different colors--a bilious brown eye\non the lookout for employment, and a bilious green eye in a similar\npredicament. In plainer terms, the stranger from Rosemary Lane was no\nother than--Captain Wragge.\n\nOutwardly speaking, the captain had not altered for the better since the\nmemorable spring day when he had presented himself to Miss Garth at the\nlodge-gate at Combe-Raven. The railway mania of that famous year had\nattacked even the wary Wragge; had withdrawn him from his customary\npursuits; and had left him prostrate in the end, like many a better\nman. He had lost his clerical appearance--he had faded with the autumn\nleaves. His crape hat-band had put itself in brown mourning for its own\nbereavement of black. His dingy white collar and cravat had died\nthe death of old linen, and had gone to their long home at the\npaper-maker's, to live again one day in quires at a stationer's shop.\nA gray shooting-jacket in the last stage of woolen atrophy replaced the\nblack frockcoat of former times, and, like a faithful servant, kept the\ndark secret of its master's linen from the eyes of a prying world. From\ntop to toe every square inch of the captain's clothing was altered for\nthe worse; but the man himself remained unchanged--superior to all forms\nof moral mildew, impervious to the action of social rust. He was as\ncourteous, as persuasive, as blandly dignified as ever. He carried his\nhead as high without a shirt-collar as ever he had carried it with one.\nThe threadbare black handkerchief round his neck was perfectly tied; his\nrotten old shoes were neatly blacked; he might have compared chins, in\nthe matter of smooth shaving, with the highest church dignitary in York.\nTime, change, and poverty had all attacked the captain together, and had\nall failed alike to get him down on the ground. He paced the streets of\nYork, a man superior to clothes and circumstances--his vagabond varnish\nas bright on him as ever.\n\nArrived at the bridge, Captain Wragge stopped and looked idly over the\nparapet at the barges in the river. It was plainly evident that he had\nno particular destination to reach and nothing whatever to do. While he\nwas still loitering, the clock of York Minster chimed the half-hour past\nfive. Cabs rattled by him over the bridge on their way to meet the train\nfrom London, at twenty minutes to six. After a moment's hesitation,\nthe captain sauntered after the cabs. When it is one of a man's regular\nhabits to live upon his fellow-creatures, that man is always more or\nless fond of haunting large railway stations. Captain Wragge gleaned the\nhuman field, and on that unoccupied afternoon the York terminus was as\nlikely a corner to look about in as any other.\n\nHe reached the platform a few minutes after the train had arrived.\nThat entire incapability of devising administrative measures for the\nmanagement of large crowds, which is one of the characteristics of\nEnglishmen in authority, is nowhere more strikingly exemplified than at\nYork. Three different lines of railway assemble three passenger mobs,\nfrom morning to night, under one roof; and leave them to raise a\ntraveler's riot, with all the assistance which the bewildered servants\nof the company can render to increase the confusion. The customary\ndisturbance was rising to its climax as Captain Wragge approached the\nplatform. Dozens of different people were trying to attain dozens of\ndifferent objects, in dozens of different directions, all starting\nfrom the same common point and all equally deprived of the means of\ninformation. A sudden parting of the crowd, near the second-class\ncarriages, attracted the captain's curiosity. He pushed his way in;\nand found a decently-dressed man--assisted by a porter and a\npoliceman--attempting to pick up some printed bills scattered from a\npaper parcel, which his frenzied fellow-passengers had knocked out of\nhis hand.\n\nOffering his assistance in this emergency, with the polite alacrity\nwhich marked his character, Captain Wragge observed the three startling\nwords, \"Fifty Pounds Reward,\" printed in capital letters on the bills\nwhich he assisted in recovering; and instantly secreted one of them,\nto be more closely examined at the first convenient opportunity. As he\ncrumpled up the bill in the palm of his hand, his party-colored eyes\nfixed with hungry interest on the proprietor of the unlucky parcel. When\na man happens not to be possessed of fifty pence in his own pocket, if\nhis heart is in the right place, it bounds; if his mouth is properly\nconstituted, it waters, at the sight of another man who carries about\nwith him a printed offer of fifty pounds sterling, addressed to his\nfellow-creatures.\n\nThe unfortunate traveler wrapped up his parcel as he best might, and\nmade his way off the platform, after addressing an inquiry to the first\nofficial victim of the day's passenger-traffic, who was sufficiently in\npossession of his senses to listen to it. Leaving the station for the\nriver-side, which was close at hand, the stranger entered the ferryboat\nat the North Street Postern. The captain, who had carefully dogged his\nsteps thus far, entered the boat also; and employed the short interval\nof transit to the opposite bank in a perusal of the handbill which he\nhad kept for his own private enlightenment. With his back carefully\nturned on the traveler, Captain Wragge now possessed his mind of the\nfollowing lines:\n\n\"FIFTY POUNDS REWARD.\n\n\"Left her home, in London, early on the morning of September 23d,\n1846, A YOUNG LADY. Age--eighteen. Dress--deep mourning. Personal\nappearance--hair of a very light brown; eyebrows and eyelashes darker;\neyes light gray; complexion strikingly pale; lower part of her face\nlarge and full; tall upright figure; walks with remarkable grace and\nease; speaks with openness and resolution; has the manners and habits\nof a refined, cultivated lady. Personal marks--two little moles,\nclose together, on the left side of the neck. Mark on the\nunder-clothing--'Magdalen Vanstone.' Is supposed to have joined, or\nattempted to join, under an assumed name, a theatrical company now\nperforming at York. Had, when she left London, one black box, and no\nother luggage. Whoever will give such information as will restore her to\nher friends shall receive the above Reward. Apply at the office of Mr.\nHarkness, solicitor, Coney Street, York. Or to Messrs. Wyatt, Pendril,\nand Gwilt, Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, London.\"\n\n\nAccustomed as Captain Wragge was to keep the completest possession of\nhimself in all hum an emergencies, his own profound astonishment, when\nthe course of his reading brought him to the mark on the linen of the\nmissing young lady, betrayed him into an exclamation of surprise which\neven startled the ferryman. The traveler was less observant; his whole\nattention was fixed on the opposite bank of the river, and he left the\nboat hastily the moment it touched the landing-place. Captain Wragge\nrecovered himself, pocketed the handbill, and followed his leader for\nthe second time.\n\nThe stranger directed his steps to the nearest street which ran down\nto the river, compared a note in his pocketbook with the numbers of the\nhouses on the left-hand side, stopped at one of them, and rang the bell.\nThe captain went on to the next house; affected to ring the bell, in his\nturn, and stood with his back to the traveler--in appearance, waiting\nto be let in; in reality, listening with all his might for any scraps\nof dialogue which might reach his ears on the opening of the door behind\nhim.\n\nThe door was answered with all due alacrity, and a sufficiently\ninstructive interchange of question and answer on the threshold rewarded\nthe dexterity of Captain Wragge.\n\n\"Does Mr. Huxtable live here?\" asked the traveler.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" was the answer, in a woman's voice.\n\n\"Is he at home?\"\n\n\"Not at home now, sir; but he will be in again at eight to-night.\"\n\n\"I think a young lady called here early in the day, did she not?\"\n\n\"Yes; a young lady came this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Exactly; I come on the same business. Did she see Mr. Huxtable?\"\n\n\"No, sir; he has been away all day. The young lady told me she would\ncome back at eight o'clock.\"\n\n\"Just so. I will call and see Mr. Huxtable at the same time.\"\n\n\"Any name, sir?\"\n\n\"No; say a gentleman called on theatrical business--that will be enough.\nWait one minute, if you please. I am a stranger in York; will you kindly\ntell me which is the way to Coney Street?\"\n\nThe woman gave the required information, the door closed, and the\nstranger hastened away in the direction of Coney Street.\n\nOn this occasion Captain Wragge made no attempt to follow him. The\nhandbill revealed plainly enough that the man's next object was to\ncomplete the necessary arrangements with the local solicitor on the\nsubject of the promised reward.\n\nHaving seen and heard enough for his immediate purpose, the captain\nretraced his steps down the street, turned to the right, and entered\non the Esplanade, which, in that quarter of the city, borders the\nriver-side between the swimming-baths and Lendal Tower. \"This is a\nfamily matter,\" said Captain Wragge to himself, persisting, from sheer\nforce of habit, in the old assertion of his relationship to Magdalen's\nmother; \"I must consider it in all its bearings.\" He tucked the umbrella\nunder his arm, crossed his hands behind him, and lowered himself\ngently into the abyss of his own reflections. The order and propriety\nobservable in the captain's shabby garments accurately typified the\norder and propriety which distinguished the operations of the captain's\nmind. It was his habit always to see his way before him through a neat\nsuccession of alternatives--and so he saw it now.\n\nThree courses were open to him in connection with the remarkable\ndiscovery which he had just made. The first course was to do nothing in\nthe matter at all. Inadmissible, on family grounds: equally inadmissible\non pecuniary grounds: rejected accordingly. The second course was\nto deserve the gratitude of the young lady's friends, rated at fifty\npounds. The third course was, by a timely warning to deserve the\ngratitude of the young lady herself, rated--at an unknown figure.\nBetween these two last alternatives the wary Wragge hesitated; not from\ndoubt of Magdalen's pecuniary resources--for he was totally ignorant\nof the circumstances which had deprived the sisters of their\ninheritance--but from doubt whether an obstacle in the shape of an\nundiscovered gentleman might not be privately connected with her\ndisappearance from home. After mature reflection, he determined to\npause, and be guided by circumstances. In the meantime, the first\nconsideration was to be beforehand with the messenger from London, and\nto lay hands securely on the young lady herself.\n\n\"I feel for this misguided girl,\" mused the captain, solemnly strutting\nbackward and forward by the lonely river-side. \"I always have looked\nupon her--I always shall look upon her--in the light of a niece.\"\n\nWhere was the adopted relative at that moment? In other words, how was\na young lady in Magdalen's critical position likely to while away\nthe hours until Mr. Huxtable 's return? If there was an obstructive\ngentleman in the background, it would be mere waste of time to pursue\nthe question. But if the inference which the handbill suggested\nwas correct--if she was really alone at that moment in the city of\nYork--where was she likely to be?\n\nNot in the crowded thoroughfares, to begin with. Not viewing the objects\nof interest in the Minster, for it was now past the hour at which the\ncathedral could be seen. Was she in the waiting-room at the railway?\nShe would hardly run that risk. Was she in one of the hotels? Doubtful,\nconsidering that she was entirely by herself. In a pastry-cook's shop?\nFar more likely. Driving about in a cab? Possible, certainly; but no\nmore. Loitering away the time in some quiet locality, out-of-doors?\nLikely enough, again, on that fine autumn evening. The captain paused,\nweighed the relative claims on his attention of the quiet locality and\nthe pastry-cook's shop; and decided for the first of the two. There was\ntime enough to find her at the pastry-cook's, to inquire after her at\nthe principal hotels, or, finally, to intercept her in Mr. Huxtable's\nimmediate neighborhood from seven to eight. While the light lasted, the\nwise course was to use it in looking for her out-of-doors. Where? The\nEsplanade was a quiet locality; but she was not there--not on the lonely\nroad beyond, which ran back by the Abbey Wall. Where next? The captain\nstopped, looked across the river, brightened under the influence of a\nnew idea, and suddenly hastened back to the ferry.\n\n\"The Walk on the Walls,\" thought this judicious man, with a twinkle of\nhis party-colored eyes. \"The quietest place in York; and the place that\nevery stranger goes to see.\"\n\nIn ten minutes more Captain Wragge was exploring the new field of\nsearch. He mounted to the walls (which inclose the whole western portion\nof the city) by the North Street Postern, from which the walk winds\nround until it ends again at its southernly extremity in the narrow\npassage of Rosemary Lane. It was then twenty minutes to seven. The sun\nhad set more than half an hour since; the red light lay broad and low in\nthe cloudless western heaven; all visible objects were softening in the\ntender twilight, but were not darkening yet. The first few lamps lit in\nthe street below looked like faint little specks of yellow light, as\nthe captain started on his walk through one of the most striking scenes\nwhich England can show.\n\nOn his right hand, as he set forth, stretched the open country beyond\nthe walls--the rich green meadows, the boundary-trees dividing them,\nthe broad windings of the river in the distance, the scattered buildings\nnearer to view; all wrapped in the evening stillness, all made beautiful\nby the evening peace. On his left hand, the majestic west front of York\nMinster soared over the city and caught the last brightest light of\nheaven on the summits of its lofty towers. Had this noble prospect\ntempted the lost girl to linger and look at it? No; thus far, not a sign\nof her. The captain looked round him attentively, and walked on.\n\nHe reached the spot where the iron course of the railroad strikes its\nway through arches in the old wall. He paused at this place--where\nthe central activity of a great railway enterprise beats, with all the\npulses of its loud-clanging life, side by side with the dead majesty\nof the past, deep under the old historic stones which tell of fortified\nYork and the sieges of two centuries since--he stood on this spot, and\nsearched for her again, and searched in vain. Others were looking idly\ndown at the desolate activity on the wilderness of the iron rails; but\nshe was not among them. The captain glanced doubtfully at the darkening\nsky, and walked on.\n\nHe stopped again where the postern of Micklegate still stands, and still\nstrengthens the city wall as of old. Here the paved walk descends a\nfew steps, passes through the dark stone guardroom of the ancient gate,\nascends again, and continues its course southward until the walls reach\nthe river once more. He paused, and peered anxiously into the dim inner\ncorners of the old guard-room. Was she waiting there for the darkness\nto come, and hide her from prying eyes? No: a solitary workman loitered\nthrough the stone chamber; but no other living creature stirred in the\nplace. The captain mounted the steps which led out from the postern and\nwalked on.\n\nHe advanced some fifty or sixty yards along the paved footway; the\noutlying suburbs of York on one side of him, a rope-walk and some\npatches of kitchen garden occupying a vacant strip of ground on the\nother. He advanced with eager eyes and quickened step; for he saw before\nhim the lonely figure of a woman, standing by the parapet of the wall,\nwith her face set toward the westward view. He approached cautiously,\nto make sure of her before she turned and observed him. There was no\nmistaking that tall, dark figure, as it rested against the parapet with\na listless grace. There she stood, in her long black cloak and gown, the\nlast dim light of evening falling tenderly on her pale, resolute young\nface. There she stood--not three months since the spoiled darling of\nher parents; the priceless treasure of the household, never left\nunprotected, never trusted alone--there she stood in the lovely dawn of\nher womanhood, a castaway in a strange city, wrecked on the world!\n\nVagabond as he was, the first sight of her staggered even the dauntless\nassurance of Captain Wragge. As she slowly turned her face and looked\nat him, he raised his hat, with the nearest approach to respect which a\nlong life of unblushing audacity had left him capable of making.\n\n\"I think I have the honor of addressing the younger Miss Vanstone?\" he\nbegan. \"Deeply gratified, I am sure--for more reasons than one.\"\n\nShe looked at him with a cold surprise. No recollection of the day when\nhe had followed her sister and herself on their way home with Miss Garth\nrose in her memory, while he now confronted her, with his altered manner\nand his altered dress.\n\n\"You are mistaken,\" she said, quietly. \"You are a perfect stranger to\nme.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" replied the captain; \"I am a species of relation. I had the\npleasure of seeing you in the spring of the present year. I presented\nmyself on that memorable occasion to an honored preceptress in your late\nfather's family. Permit me, under equally agreeable circumstances, to\npresent myself to _you_. My name is Wragge.\"\n\nBy this time he had recovered complete possession of his own impudence;\nhis party-colored eyes twinkled cheerfully, and he accompanied his\nmodest announcement of himself with a dancing-master's bow.\n\nMagdalen frowned, and drew back a step. The captain was not a man to be\ndaunted by a cold reception. He tucked his umbrella under his arm and\njocosely spelled his name for her further enlightenment. \"W, R,\nA, double G, E--Wragge,\" said the captain, ticking off the letters\npersuasively on his fingers.\n\n\"I remember your name,\" said Magdalen. \"Excuse me for leaving you\nabruptly. I have an engagement.\"\n\nShe tried to pass him and walk on northward toward the railway. He\ninstantly met the attempt by raising both hands, and displaying a pair\nof darned black gloves outspread in polite protest.\n\n\"Not that way,\" he said; \"not that way, Miss Vanstone, I beg and\nentreat!\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she asked haughtily.\n\n\"Because,\" answered the captain, \"that is the way which leads to Mr.\nHuxtable's.\"\n\nIn the ungovernable astonishment of hearing his reply she suddenly\nbent forward, and for the first time looked him close in the face.\nHe sustained her suspicious scrutiny with every appearance of feeling\nhighly gratified by it. \"H, U, X--Hux,\" said the captain, playfully\nturning to the old joke: \"T, A--ta, Huxta; B, L, E--ble; Huxtable.\"\n\n\"What do you know about Mr. Huxtable?\" she asked. \"What do you mean by\nmentioning him to me?\"\n\nThe captain's curly lip took a new twist upward. He immediately replied,\nto the best practical purpose, by producing the handbill from his\npocket.\n\n\"There is just light enough left,\" he said, \"for young (and lovely)\neyes to read by. Before I enter upon the personal statement which your\nflattering inquiry claims from me, pray bestow a moment's attention on\nthis Document.\"\n\nShe took the handbill from him. By the last gleam of twilight she\nread the lines which set a price on her recovery--which published the\ndescription of her in pitiless print, like the description of a strayed\ndog. No tender consideration had prepared her for the shock, no kind\nword softened it to her when it came. The vagabond, whose cunning eyes\nwatched her eagerly while she read, knew no more that the handbill which\nhe had stolen had only been prepared in anticipation of the worst, and\nwas only to be publicly used in the event of all more considerate means\nof tracing her being tried in vain--than she knew it. The bill dropped\nfrom her hand; her face flushed deeply. She turned away from Captain\nWragge, as if all idea of his existence had passed out of her mind.\n\n\"Oh, Norah, Norah!\" she said to herself, sorrowfully. \"After the letter\nI wrote you--after the hard struggle I had to go away! Oh, Norah,\nNorah!\"\n\n\"How is Norah?\" inquired the captain, with the utmost politeness.\n\nShe turned upon him with an angry brightness in her large gray eyes. \"Is\nthis thing shown publicly?\" she asked, stamping her foot on it. \"Is the\nmark on my neck described all over York?\"\n\n\"Pray compose yourself,\" pleaded the persuasive Wragge. \"At present I\nhave every reason to believe that you have just perused the only copy in\ncirculation. Allow me to pick it up.\"\n\nBefore he could touch the bill she snatched it from the pavement, tore\nit into fragments, and threw them over the wall.\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried the captain. \"You remind me of your poor dear mother.\nThe family spirit, Miss Vanstone. We all inherit our hot blood from my\nmaternal grandfather.\"\n\n\"How did you come by it?\" she asked, suddenly.\n\n\"My dear creature, I have just told you,\" remonstrated the captain. \"We\nall come by it from my maternal grandfather.\"\n\n\"How did you come by that handbill?\" she repeated, passionately.\n\n\"I beg ten thousand pardons! My head was running on the family\nspirit.--How did I come by it? Briefly thus.\" Here Captain Wragge\nentered on his personal statement; taking his customary vocal exercise\nthrough the longest words of the English language, with the highest\nelocutionary relish. Having, on this rare occasion, nothing to gain by\nconcealment, he departed from his ordinary habits, and, with the utmost\namazement at the novelty of his own situation, permitted himself to tell\nthe unmitigated truth.\n\nThe effect of the narrative on Magdalen by no means fulfilled Captain\nWragge's anticipations in relating it. She was not startled; she was not\nirritated; she showed no disposition to cast herself on his mercy, and\nto seek his advice. She looked him steadily in the face; and all she\nsaid, when he had neatly rounded his last sentence, was--\"Go on.\"\n\n\"Go on?\" repeated the captain. \"Shocked to disappoint you, I am sure;\nbut the fact is, I have done.\"\n\n\"No, you have not,\" she rejoined; \"you have left out the end of your\nstory. The end of it is, you came here to look for me; and you mean to\nearn the fifty pounds reward.\"\n\nThose plain words so completely staggered Captain Wragge that for the\nmoment he stood speechless. But he had faced awkward truths of all sorts\nfar too often to be permanently disconcerted by them. Before Magdalen\ncould pursue her advantage, the vagabond had recovered his balance:\nWragge was himself again.\n\n\"Smart,\" said the captain, laughing indulgently, and drumming with his\numbrella on the pavement. \"Some men might take it seriously. I'm not\neasily offended. Try again.\"\n\nMagdalen looked at him through the gathering darkness in mute\nperplexity. All her little experience of society had been experience\namong people who possessed a common sense of honor, and a common\nresponsibility of social position. She had hitherto seen nothing but\nthe successful human product from the great manufactory of Civilization.\nHere was one of the failures, and, with all her quickness, she was\npuzzled how to deal with it.\n\n\"Pardon me for returning to the subject,\" pursued the captain. \"It has\njust occurred to my mind that you might actually have spoken in earnest.\nMy poor child! how can I earn the fifty pounds before the reward is\noffered to me? Those handbills may not be publicly posted for a week to\ncome. Precious as you are to all your relatives (myself included), take\nmy word for it, the lawyers who are managing this case will not pay\nfifty pounds for you if they can possibly help it. Are you still\npersuaded that my needy pockets are gaping for the money? Very good.\nButton them up in spite of me with your own fair fingers. There is a\ntrain to London at nine forty-five to-night. Submit yourself to your\nfriend's wishes and go back by it.\"\n\n\"Never!\" said Magdalen, firing at the bare suggestion, exactly as\nthe captain had intended she should. \"If my mind had not been made up\nbefore, that vile handbill would have decided me. I forgive Norah,\" she\nadded, turning away and speaking to herself, \"but not Mr. Pendril, and\nnot Miss Garth.\"\n\n\"Quite right!\" said Captain Wragge. \"The family spirit. I should have\ndone the same myself at your age. It runs in the blood. Hark! there goes\nthe clock again--half-past seven. Miss Vanstone, pardon this seasonable\nabruptness! If you are to carry out your resolution--if you are to\nbe your own mistress much longer, you must take a course of some kind\nbefore eight o'clock. You are young, you are inexperienced, you are in\nimminent danger. Here is a position of emergency on one side--and here\nam I, on the other, with an uncle's interest in you, full of advice. Tap\nme.\"\n\n\"Suppose I choose to depend on nobody, and to act for myself?\" said\nMagdalen. \"What then?\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied the captain, \"you will walk straight into one of the\nfour traps which are set to catch you in the ancient and interesting\ncity of York. Trap the first, at Mr. Huxtable's house; trap the second,\nat all the hotels; trap the third, at the railway station; trap the\nfourth, at the theater. That man with the handbills has had an hour at\nhis disposal. If he has not set those four traps (with the assistance\nof the local solicitor) by this time, he is not the competent lawyer's\nclerk I take him for. Come, come, my dear girl! if there is somebody\nelse in the background, whose advice you prefer to mine--\"\n\n\"You see that I am alone,\" she interposed, proudly. \"If you knew me\nbetter, you would know that I depend on nobody but myself.\"\n\nThose words decided the only doubt which now remained in the captain's\nmind--the doubt whether the course was clear before him. The motive\nof her flight from home was evidently what the handbills assumed it\nto be--a reckless fancy for going on the stage. \"One of two things,\"\nthought Wragge to himself, in his logical way. \"She's worth more than\nfifty pounds to me in her present situation, or she isn't. If she is,\nher friends may whistle for her. If she isn't, I have only to keep her\ntill the bills are posted.\" Fortified by this simple plan of action, the\ncaptain returned to the charge, and politely placed Magdalen between the\ntwo inevitable alternatives of trusting herself to him, on the one hand,\nor of returning to her friends, on the other.\n\n\"I respect independence of character wherever I find it,\" he said, with\nan air of virtuous severity. \"In a young and lovely relative, I more\nthan respect--I admire it. But (excuse the bold assertion), to walk on\na way of your own, you must first have a way to walk on. Under existing\ncircumstances, where is _your_ way? Mr. Huxtable is out of the question,\nto begin with.\"\n\n\"Out of the question for to-night,\" said Magdalen; \"but what hinders\nme from writing to Mr. Huxtable, and making my own private arrangements\nwith him for to-morrow?\"\n\n\"Granted with all my heart--a hit, a palpable hit. Now for my turn. To\nget to to-morrow (excuse the bold assertion, once more), you must first\npass through to-night. Where are you to sleep?\"\n\n\"Are there no hotels in York?\"\n\n\"Excellent hotels for large families; excellent hotels for single\ngentlemen. The very worst hotels in the world for handsome young ladies\nwho present themselves alone at the door without male escort, without a\nmaid in attendance, and without a single article of luggage. Dark as it\nis, I think I could see a lady's box, if there was anything of the sort\nin our immediate neighborhood.\"\n\n\"My box is at the cloak-room. What is to prevent my sending the ticket\nfor it?\"\n\n\"Nothing--if you want to communicate your address by means of your\nbox--nothing whatever. Think; pray think! Do you really suppose that the\npeople who are looking for you are such fools as not to have an eye\non the cloakroom? Do you think they are such fools--when they find you\ndon't come to Mr. Huxtable's at eight to-night--as not to inquire at all\nthe hotels? Do you think a young lady of your striking appearance (even\nif they consented to receive you) could take up her abode at an inn\nwithout becoming the subject of universal curiosity and remark? Here is\nnight coming on as fast as it can. Don't let me bore you; only let me\nask once more--Where are you to sleep?\"\n\nThere was no answer to that question: in Magdalen's position, there was\nliterally no answer to it on her side. She was silent.\n\n\"Where are you to sleep?\" repeated the captain. \"The reply is\nobvious--under my roof. Mrs. Wragge will be charmed to see you. Look\nupon her as your aunt; pray look upon her as your aunt. The landlady is\na widow, the house is close by, there are no other lodgers, and there\nis a bedroom to let. Can anything be more satisfactory, under all the\ncircumstances? Pray observe, I say nothing about to-morrow--I leave\nto-morrow to you, and confine myself exclusively to the night. I may,\nor may not, command theatrical facilities, which I am in a position to\noffer you. Sympathy and admiration may, or may not, be strong within me,\nwhen I contemplate the dash and independence of your character. Hosts\nof examples of bright stars of the British drama, who have begun their\napprenticeship to the stage as you are beginning yours, may, or may not,\ncrowd on my memory. These are topics for the future. For the present,\nI confine myself within my strict range of duty. We are within five\nminutes' walk of my present address. Allow me to offer you my arm. No?\nYou hesitate? You distrust me? Good heavens! is it possible you can have\nheard anything to my disadvantage?\"\n\n\"Quite possible,\" said Magdalen, without a moment's flinching from the\nanswer.\n\n\"May I inquire the particulars?\" asked the captain, with the politest\ncomposure. \"Don't spare my feelings; oblige me by speaking out. In the\nplainest terms, now, what have you heard?\"\n\nShe answered him with a woman's desperate disregard of consequences when\nshe is driven to bay--she answered him instantly,\n\n\"I have heard you are a Rogue.\"\n\n\"Have you, indeed?\" said the impenetrable Wragge. \"A Rogue? Well, I\nwaive my privilege of setting you right on that point for a fitter\ntime. For the sake of argument, let us say I am a Rogue. What is Mr.\nHuxtable?\"\n\n\"A respectable man, or I should not have seen him in the house where we\nfirst met.\"\n\n\"Very good. Now observe! You talked of writing to Mr. Huxtable a minute\nago. What do you think a respectable man is likely to do with a young\nlady who openly acknowledges that she has run away from her home and her\nfriends to go on the stage? My dear girl, on your own showing, it's\nnot a respectable man you want in your present predicament. It's a\nRogue--like me.\"\n\nMagdalen laughed, bitterly.\n\n\"There is some truth in that,\" she said. \"Thank you for recalling me\nto myself and my circumstances. I have my end to gain--and who am I, to\npick and choose the way of getting to it? It is my turn to beg pardon\nnow. I have been talking as if I was a young lady of family and\nposition. Absurd! We know better than that, don't we, Captain Wragge?\nYou are quite right. Nobody's child must sleep under Somebody's\nroof--and why not yours?\"\n\n\"This way,\" said the captain, dexterously profiting by the sudden change\nin her humor, and cunningly refraining from exasperating it by saying\nmore himself. \"This way.\"\n\nShe followed him a few steps, and suddenly stopped.\n\n\"Suppose I _am_ discovered?\" she broke out, abruptly. \"Who has any\nauthority over me? Who can take me back, if I don't choose to go? If\nthey all find me to-morrow, what then? Can't I say No to Mr. Pendril?\nCan't I trust my own courage with Miss Garth?\"\n\n\"Can you trust your courage with your sister?\" whispered the captain,\nwho had not forgotten the references to Norah which had twice escaped\nher already.\n\nHer head drooped. She shivered as if the cold night air had struck her,\nand leaned back wearily against the parapet of the wall.\n\n\"Not with Norah,\" she said, sadly. \"I could trust myself with the\nothers. Not with Norah.\"\n\n\"This way,\" repeated Captain Wragge. She roused herself; looked up at\nthe darkening heaven, looked round at the darkening view. \"What must be,\nmust,\" she said, and followed him.\n\nThe Minster clock struck the quarter to eight as they left the Walk on\nthe Wall and descended the steps into Rosemary Lane. Almost at the same\nmoment the lawyer's clerk from London gave the last instructions to his\nsubordinates, and took up his own position, on the opposite side of the\nriver, within easy view of Mr. Huxtable's door.\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nCAPTAIN WRAGGE stopped nearly midway in the one little row of houses\ncomposing Rosemary Lane, and let himself and his guest in at the door of\nhis lodgings with his own key. As they entered the passage, a care-worn\nwoman in a widow's cap made her appearance with a candle. \"My niece,\"\nsaid the captain, presenting Magdalen; \"my niece on a visit to York. She\nhas kindly consented to occupy your empty bedroom. Consider it let, if\nyou please, to my niece--and be very particular in airing the sheets?\nIs Mrs. Wragge upstairs? Very good. You may lend me your candle. My\ndear girl, Mrs. Wragge's boudoir is on the first floor; Mrs. Wragge is\nvisible. Allow me to show you the way up.\"\n\nAs he ascended the stairs first, the care-worn widow whispered,\npiteously, to Magdalen, \"I hope you'll pay me, miss. Your uncle\ndoesn't.\"\n\nThe captain threw open the door of the front room on the first\nfloor, and disclosed a female figure, arrayed in a gown of tarnished\namber-colored satin, seated solitary on a small chair, with dingy old\ngloves on its hands, with a tattered old book on its knees, and with one\nlittle bedroom candle by its side. The figure terminated at its upper\nextremity in a large, smooth, white round face--like a moon--encircled\nby a cap and green ribbons, and dimly irradiated by eyes of mild and\nfaded blue, which looked straightforward into vacancy, and took not the\nsmallest notice of Magdalen's appearance, on the opening of the door.\n\n\"Mrs. Wragge!\" cried the captain, shouting at her as if she was fast\nasleep. \"Mrs. Wragge!\"\n\nThe lady of the faded blue eyes slowly rose to an apparently\ninterminable height. When she had at last attained an upright position,\nshe towered to a stature of two or three inches over six feet. Giants of\nboth sexes are, by a wise dispensation of Providence, created, for the\nmost part, gentle. If Mrs. Wragge and a lamb had been placed side by\nside, comparison, under those circumstances, would have exposed the lamb\nas a rank impostor.\n\n\"Tea, captain?\" inquired Mrs. Wragge, looking submissively down at\nher husband, whose head, when he stood on tiptoe, barely reached her\nshoulder.\n\n\"Miss Vanstone, the younger,\" said the captain, presenting Magdalen.\n\"Our fair relative, whom I have met by fortunate accident. Our guest for\nthe night. Our guest!\" reiterated the captain, shouting once more as if\nthe tall lady was still fast asleep, in spite of the plain testimony of\nher own eyes to the contrary.\n\nA smile expressed itself (in faint outline) on the large vacant space of\nMrs. Wragge's countenance. \"Oh?\" she said, interrogatively. \"Oh, indeed?\nPlease, miss, will you sit down? I'm sorry--no, I don't mean I'm sorry;\nI mean I'm glad--\" she stopped, and consulted her husband by a helpless\nlook.\n\n\"Glad, of course!\" shouted the captain.\n\n\"Glad, of course,\" echoed the giantess of the amber satin, more meekly\nthan ever.\n\n\"Mrs. Wragge is not deaf,\" explained the captain. \"She's only a little\nslow. Constitutionally torpid--if I may use the expression. I am merely\nloud with her (and I beg you will honor me by being loud, too) as a\nnecessary stimulant to her ideas. Shout at her--and her mind comes up\nto time. Speak to her--and she drifts miles away from you directly. Mrs.\nWragge!\"\n\nMrs. Wragge instantly acknowledged the stimulant. \"Tea, captain?\" she\ninquired, for the second time.\n\n\"Put your cap straight!\" shouted her husband. \"I beg ten thousand\npardons,\" he resumed, again addressing himself to Magdalen. \"The sad\ntruth is, I am a martyr to my own sense of order. All untidiness, all\nwant of system and regularity, cause me the acutest irritation. My\nattention is distracted, my composure is upset; I can't rest till things\nare set straight again. Externally speaking, Mrs. Wragge is, to my\ninfinite regret, the crookedest woman I ever met with. More to the\nright!\" shouted the captain, as Mrs. Wragge, like a well-trained\nchild, presented herself with her revised head-dress for her husband's\ninspection.\n\nMrs. Wragge immediately pulled the cap to the left. Magdalen rose, and\nset it right for her. The moon-face of the giantess brightened for the\nfirst time. She looked admiringly at Magdalen's cloak and bonnet. \"Do\nyou like dress, miss?\" she asked, suddenly, in a confidential whisper.\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Show Miss Vanstone her room,\" said the captain, looking as if the whole\nhouse belonged to him. \"The spare-room, the landlady's spare-room, on\nthe third floor front. Offer Miss Vanstone all articles connected with\nthe toilet of which she may stand in need. She has no luggage with her.\nSupply the deficiency, and then come back and make tea.\"\n\nMrs. Wragge acknowledged the receipt of these lofty directions by a\nlook of placid bewilderment, and led the way out of the room; Magdalen\nfollowing her, with a candle presented by the attentive captain. As\nsoon as they were alone on the landing outside, Mrs. Wragge raised the\ntattered old book which she had been reading when Magdalen was first\npresented to her, and which she had never let out of her hand since, and\nslowly tapped herself on the forehead with it. \"Oh, my poor head!\" said\nthe tall lady, in meek soliloquy; \"it's Buzzing again worse than ever!\"\n\n\"Buzzing?\" repeated Magdalen, in the utmost astonishment.\n\nMrs. Wragge ascended the stairs, without offering any explanation,\nstopped at one of the rooms on the second floor, and led the way in.\n\n\"This is not the third floor,\" said Magdalen. \"This is not my room,\nsurely?\"\n\n\"Wait a bit,\" pleaded Mrs. Wragge. \"Wait a bit, miss, before we go up\nany higher. I've got the Buzzing in my head worse than ever. Please wait\nfor me till I'm a little better again.\"\n\n\"Shall I ask for help?\" inquired Magdalen. \"Shall I call the landlady?\"\n\n\"Help?\" echoed Mrs. Wragge. \"Bless you, I don't want help! I'm used to\nit. I've had the Buzzing in my head, off and on--how many years?\" She\nstopped, reflected, lost herself, and suddenly tried a question in\ndespair. \"Have you ever been at Darch's Dining-rooms in London?\" she\nasked, with an appearance of the deepest interest.\n\n\"No,\" replied Magdalen, wondering at the strange inquiry.\n\n\"That's where the Buzzing in my head first began,\" said Mrs. Wragge,\nfollowing the new clew with the deepest attention and anxiety. \"I was\nemployed to wait on the gentlemen at Darch's Dining-rooms--I was. The\ngentlemen all came together; the gentlemen were all hungry together; the\ngentlemen all gave their orders together--\" She stopped, and tapped her\nhead again, despondently, with the tattered old book.\n\n\"And you had to keep all their orders in your memory, separate one from\nthe other?\" suggested Magdalen, helping her out. \"And the trying to do\nthat confused you?\"\n\n\"That's it!\" said Mrs. Wragge, becoming violently excited in a moment.\n\"Boiled pork and greens and pease-pudding, for Number One. Stewed beef\nand carrots and gooseberry tart, for Number Two. Cut of mutton, and\nquick about it, well done, and plenty of fat, for Number Three. Codfish\nand parsnips, two chops to follow, hot-and-hot, or I'll be the death of\nyou, for Number Four. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Carrots and\ngooseberry tart--pease-pudding and plenty of fat--pork and beef and\nmutton, and cut 'em all, and quick about it--stout for one, and ale for\nt'other--and stale bread here, and new bread there--and this gentleman\nlikes cheese, and that gentleman doesn't--Matilda, Tilda, Tilda, Tilda,\nfifty times over, till I didn't know my own name again--oh lord! oh\nlord!! oh lord!!! all together, all at the same time, all out of temper,\nall buzzing in my poor head like forty thousand million bees--don't tell\nthe captain! don't tell the captain!\" The unfortunate creature dropped\nthe tattered old book, and beat both her hands on her head, with a look\nof blank terror fixed on the door.\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said Magdalen. \"The captain hasn't heard you. I know what\nis the matter with your head now. Let me cool it.\"\n\nShe dipped a towel in water, and pressed it on the hot and helpless head\nwhich Mrs. Wragge submitted to her with the docility of a sick child.\n\n\"What a pretty hand you've got!\" said the poor creature, feeling the\nrelief of the coolness and taking Magdalen's hand, admiringly, in her\nown. \"How soft and white it is! I try to be a lady; I always keep my\ngloves on--but I can't get my hands like yours. I'm nicely dressed,\nthough, ain't I? I like dress; it's a comfort to me. I'm always happy\nwhen I'm looking at my things. I say--you won't be angry with me?--I\nshould so like to try your bonnet on.\"\n\nMagdalen humored her, with the ready compassion of the young. She stood\nsmiling and nodding at herself in the glass, with the bonnet perched\non the top of her head. \"I had one as pretty as this, once,\" she\nsaid--\"only it was white, not black. I wore it when the captain married\nme.\"\n\n\"Where did you meet with him?\" asked Magdalen, putting the question as\na chance means of increasing her scanty stock of information on the\nsubject of Captain Wragge.\n\n\"At the Dining-rooms,\" said Mrs. Wragge. \"He was the hungriest and the\nloudest to wait upon of the lot of 'em. I made more mistakes with him\nthan I did with all the rest of them put together. He used to swear--oh,\ndidn't he use to swear! When he left off swearing at me he married me.\nThere was others wanted me besides him. Bless you, I had my pick. Why\nnot? When you have a trifle of money left you that you didn't expect, if\nthat don't make a lady of you, what does? Isn't a lady to have her pick?\nI had my trifle of money, and I had my pick, and I picked the captain--I\ndid. He was the smartest and the shortest of them all. He took care of\nme and my money. I'm here, the money's gone. Don't you put that towel\ndown on the table--he won't have that! Don't move his razors--don't,\nplease, or I shall forget which is which. I've got to remember which is\nwhich to-morrow morning. Bless you, the captain don't shave himself!\nHe had me taught. I shave him. I do his hair, and cut his nails--he's\nawfully particular about his nails. So he is about his trousers. And\nhis shoes. And his newspaper in the morning. And his breakfasts, and\nlunches, and dinners, and teas--\" She stopped, struck by a sudden\nrecollection, looked about her, observed the tattered old book on the\nfloor, and clasped her hands in despair. \"I've lost the place!\" she\nexclaimed helplessly. \"Oh, mercy, what will become of me! I've lost the\nplace.\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Magdalen; \"I'll soon find the place for you again.\"\n\nShe picked up the book, looked into the pages, and found that the\nobject of Mrs. Wragge's anxiety was nothing more important than an\nold-fashioned Treatise on the Art of Cookery, reduced under the usual\nheads of Fish, Flesh, and Fowl, and containing the customary series of\nrecipes. Turning over the leaves, Magdalen came to one particular page,\nthickly studded with little drops of moisture half dry. \"Curious!\" she\nsaid. \"If this was anything but a cookery-book, I should say somebody\nhad been crying over it.\"\n\n\"Somebody?\" echoed Mrs. Wragge, with a stare of amazement. \"It isn't\nsomebody--it's Me. Thank you kindly, that's the place, sure enough.\nBless you, I'm used to crying over it. You'd cry, too, if you had to get\nthe captain's dinners out of it. As sure as ever I sit down to this book\nthe Buzzing in my head begins again. Who's to make it out? Sometimes\nI think I've got it, and it all goes away from me. Sometimes I think I\nhaven't got it, and it all comes back in a heap. Look here! Here's what\nhe's ordered for his breakfast to-morrow: 'Omelette with Herbs. Beat up\ntwo eggs with a little water or milk, salt, pepper, chives, and parsley.\nMince small.'--There! mince small! How am I to mince small when it's all\nmixed up and running? 'Put a piece of butter the size of your thumb into\nthe frying-pan.'--Look at my thumb, and look at yours! whose size does\nshe mean? 'Boil, but not brown.'--If it mustn't be brown, what color\nmust it be? She won't tell me; she expects me to know, and I don't.\n'Pour in the omelette.'--There! I can do that. 'Allow it to set, raise\nit round the edge; when done, turn it over to double it.'--Oh, the\nnumber of times I turned it over and doubled it in my head, before you\ncame in to-night! 'Keep it soft; put the dish on the frying-pan, and\nturn it over.' Which am I to turn over--oh, mercy, try the cold towel\nagain, and tell me which--the dish or the frying-pan?\"\n\n\"Put the dish on the frying-pan,\" said Magdalen; \"and then turn the\nfrying-pan over. That is what it means, I think.\"\n\n\"Thank you kindly,\" said Mrs. Wragge, \"I want to get it into my head;\nplease say it again.\"\n\nMagdalen said it again.\n\n\"And then turn the frying-pan over,\" repeated Mrs. Wragge, with a sudden\nburst of energy. \"I've got it now! Oh, the lots of omelettes all frying\ntogether in my head; and all frying wrong! Much obliged, I'm sure.\nYou've put me all right again: I'm only a little tired with talking.\nAnd then turn the frying-pan, then turn the frying-pan, then turn the\nfrying-pan over. It sounds like poetry, don't it?\"\n\nHer voice sank, and she drowsily closed her eyes. At the same moment the\ndoor of the room below opened, and the captain's mellifluous bass notes\nfloated upstairs, charged with the customary stimulant to his wife's\nfaculties.\n\n\"Mrs. Wragge!\" cried the captain. \"Mrs. Wragge!\"\n\nShe started to her feet at that terrible summons. \"Oh, what did he tell\nme to do?\" she asked, distractedly. \"Lots of things, and I've forgotten\nthem all!\"\n\n\"Say you have done them when he asks you,\" suggested Magdalen. \"They\nwere things for me--things I don't want. I remember all that is\nnecessary. My room is the front room on the third floor. Go downstairs\nand say I am coming directly.\"\n\nShe took up the candle and pushed Mrs. Wragge out on the landing. \"Say\nI am coming directly,\" she whispered again--and went upstairs by herself\nto the third story.\n\nThe room was small, close, and very poorly furnished. In former days\nMiss Garth would have hesitated to offer such a room to one of the\nservants at Combe-Raven. But it was quiet; it gave her a few minutes\nalone; and it was endurable, even welcome, on that account. She locked\nherself in and walked mechanically, with a woman's first impulse in\na strange bedroom, to the rickety little table and the dingy little\nlooking-glass. She waited there for a moment, and then turned away with\nweary contempt. \"What does it matter how pale I am?\" she thought to\nherself. \"Frank can't see me--what does it matter now!\"\n\nShe laid aside her cloak and bonnet, and sat down to collect herself.\nBut the events of the day had worn her out. The past, when she tried\nto remember it, only made her heart ache. The future, when she tried\nto penetrate it, was a black void. She rose again, and stood by the\nuncurtained window--stood looking out, as if there was some hidden\nsympathy for her own desolation in the desolate night.\n\n\"Norah!\" she said to herself, tenderly; \"I wonder if Norah is thinking\nof me? Oh, if I could be as patient as she is! If I could only forget\nthe debt we owe to Michael Vanstone!\"\n\nHer face darkened with a vindictive despair, and she paced the little\ncage of a room backward and forward, softly. \"No: never till the debt\nis paid!\" Her thoughts veered back again to Frank. \"Still at sea, poor\nfellow; further and further away from me; sailing through the day,\nsailing through the night. Oh, Frank, love me!\"\n\nHer eyes filled with tears. She dashed them away, made for the door, and\nlaughed with a desperate levity, as she unlocked it again.\n\n\"Any company is better than my own thoughts,\" she burst out, recklessly,\nas she left the room. \"I'm forgetting my ready-made relations--my\nhalf-witted aunt, and my uncle the rogue.\" She descended the stairs\nto the landing on the first floor, and paused there in momentary\nhesitation. \"How will it end?\" she asked herself. \"Where is my\nblindfolded journey taking me to now? Who knows, and who cares?\"\n\nShe entered the room.\n\n\nCaptain Wragge was presiding at the tea-tray with the air of a prince\nin his own banqueting-hall. At one side of the table sat Mrs. Wragge,\nwatching her husband's eye like an animal waiting to be fed. At the\nother side was an empty chair, toward which the captain waved his\npersuasive hand when Magdalen came in. \"How do you like your room?\" he\ninquired; \"I trust Mrs. Wragge has made herself useful? You take\nmilk and sugar? Try the local bread, honor the York butter, test\nthe freshness of a new and neighboring egg. I offer my little all. A\npauper's meal, my dear girl--seasoned with a gentleman's welcome.\"\n\n\"Seasoned with salt, pepper, chives and parsley,\" murmured Mrs. Wragge,\ncatching instantly at a word in connection with cookery, and harnessing\nher head to the omelette for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"Sit straight at the table!\" shouted the captain. \"More to the left,\nmore still--that will do. During your absence upstairs,\" he continued,\naddressing himself to Magdalen, \"my mind has not been unemployed. I\nhave been considering your position with a view exclusively to your\nown benefit. If you decide on being guided to-morrow by the light of\nmy experience, that light is unreservedly at your service. You may\nnaturally say: 'I know but little of you, captain, and that little is\nunfavorable.' Granted, on one condition--that you permit me to make\nmyself and my character quite familiar to you when tea is over. False\nshame is foreign to my nature. You see my wife, my house, my bread, my\nbutter, and my eggs, all exactly as they are. See me, too, my dear girl,\nwhile you are about it.\"\n\nWhen tea was over, Mrs. Wragge, at a signal from her husband, retired to\na corner of the room, with the eternal cookery-book still in her hand.\n\"Mince small,\" she whispered, confidentially, as she passed Magdalen.\n\"That's a teaser, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Down at heel again!\" shouted the captain, pointing to his wife's heavy\nflat feet as they shuffled across the room. \"The right shoe. Pull it up\nat heel, Mrs. Wragge--pull it up at heel! Pray allow me,\" he continued,\noffering his arm to Magdalen, and escorting her to a dirty little\nhorse-hair sofa. \"You want repose--after your long journey, you really\nwant repose.\" He drew his chair to the sofa, and surveyed her with a\nbland look of investigation--as if he had been her medical attendant,\nwith a diagnosis on his mind.\n\n\"Very pleasant! very pleasant!\" said the captain, when he had seen his\nguest comfortable on the sofa. \"I feel quite in the bosom of my family.\nShall we return to our subject--the subject of my rascally self? No!\nno! No apologies, no protestations, pray. Don't mince the matter on your\nside--and depend on me not to mince it on mine. Now come to facts;\npray come to facts. Who, and what am I? Carry your mind back to our\nconversation on the Walls of this interesting City, and let us start\nonce more from your point of view. I am a Rogue; and, in that capacity\n(as I have already pointed out), the most useful man you possibly could\nhave met with. Now observe! There are many varieties of Rogue; let me\ntell you my variety, to begin with. I am a Swindler.\"\n\nHis entire shamelessness was really super-human. Not the vestige of a\nblush varied the sallow monotony of his complexion; the smile wreathed\nhis curly lips as pleasantly as ever his party-colored eyes twinkled at\nMagdalen with the self-enjoying frankness of a naturally harmless man.\nHad his wife heard him? Magdalen looked over his shoulder to the corner\nof the room in which she was sitting behind him. No the self-taught\nstudent of cookery was absorbed in her subject. She had advanced her\nimaginary omelette to the critical stage at which the butter was to\nbe thrown in--that vaguely-measured morsel of butter, the size of your\nthumb. Mrs. Wragge sat lost in contemplation of one of her own thumbs,\nand shook her head over it, as if it failed to satisfy her.\n\n\"Don't be shocked,\" proceeded the captain; \"don't be astonished.\nSwindler is nothing but a word of two syllables. S, W, I, N, D--swind;\nL, E, R--ler; Swindler. Definition: A moral agriculturist; a man who\ncultivates the field of human sympathy. I am that moral agriculturist,\nthat cultivating man. Narrow-minded mediocrity, envious of my success in\nmy profession, calls me a Swindler. What of that? The same low tone of\nmind assails men in other professions in a similar manner--calls great\nwriters scribblers--great generals, butchers--and so on. It entirely\ndepends on the point of view. Adopting your point, I announce myself\nintelligibly as a Swindler. Now return the obligation, and adopt\nmine. Hear what I have to say for myself, in the exercise of my\nprofession.--Shall I continue to put it frankly?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Magdalen; \"and I'll tell you frankly afterward what I think\nof it.\"\n\nThe captain cleared his throat; mentally assembled his entire army of\nwords--horse, foot, artillery, and reserves; put himself at the head;\nand dashed into action, to carry the moral intrenchments of Society by a\ngeneral charge.\n\n\"Now observe,\" he began. \"Here am I, a needy object. Very good. Without\ncomplicating the question by asking how I come to be in that condition,\nI will merely inquire whether it is, or is not, the duty of a Christian\ncommunity to help the needy. If you say No, you simply shock me; and\nthere is an end of it; if you say Yes, then I beg to ask, Why am I to\nblame for making a Christian community do its duty? You may say, Is a\ncareful man who has saved money bound to spend it again on a careless\nstranger who has saved none? Why of course he is! And on what ground,\npray? Good heavens! on the ground that he has _got_ the money, to be\nsure. All the world over, the man who has not got the thing, obtains it,\non one pretense or another, of the man who has--and, in nine cases out\nof ten, the pretense is a false one. What! your pockets are full, and\nmy pockets are empty; and you refuse to help me? Sordid wretch! do you\nthink I will allow you to violate the sacred obligations of charity\nin my person? I won't allow you--I say, distinctly, I won't allow you.\nThose are my principles as a moral agriculturist. Principles which admit\nof trickery? Certainly. Am I to blame if the field of human sympathy\ncan't be cultivated in any other way? Consult my brother agriculturists\nin the mere farming line--do they get their crops for the asking? No!\nthey must circumvent arid Nature exactly as I circumvent sordid\nMan. They must plow, and sow, and top-dress, and bottom-dress, and\ndeep-drain, and surface-drain, and all the rest of it. Why am I to be\nchecked in the vast occupation of deep-draining mankind? Why am I to be\npersecuted for habitually exciting the noblest feelings of our common\nnature? Infamous!--I can characterize it by no other word--infamous! If\nI hadn't confidence in the future, I should despair of humanity--but I\nhave confidence in the future. Yes! one of these days (when I am dead\nand gone), as ideas enlarge and enlightenment progresses, the abstract\nmerits of the profession now called swindling will be recognized.\nWhen that day comes, don't drag me out of my grave and give me a public\nfuneral; don't take advantage of my having no voice to raise in my own\ndefense, and insult me by a national statue. No! do me justice on my\ntombstone; dash me off, in one masterly sentence, on my epitaph. Here\nlies Wragge, embalmed in the tardy recognition of his species: he\nplowed, sowed, and reaped his fellow-creatures; and enlightened\nposterity congratulates him on the uniform excellence of his crops.\"\n\nHe stopped; not from want of confidence, not from want of words--purely\nfrom want of breath. \"I put it frankly, with a dash of humor,\" he said,\npleasantly. \"I don't shock you--do I?\" Weary and heart-sick as she\nwas--suspicious of others, doubtful of herself--the extravagant\nimpudence of Captain Wragge's defense of swindling touched Magdalen's\nnatural sense of humor, and forced a smile to her lips. \"Is the\nYorkshire crop a particularly rich one just at present?\" she inquired,\nmeeting him, in her neatly feminine way, with his own weapons.\n\n\"A hit--a palpable hit,\" said the captain, jocosely exhibiting the\ntails of his threadbare shooting jacket, as a practical commentary on\nMagdalen's remark. \"My dear girl, here or elsewhere, the crop never\nfails--but one man can't always gather it in. The assistance of\nintelligent co-operation is, I regret to say, denied me. I have nothing\nin common with the clumsy rank and file of my profession, who convict\nthemselves, before recorders and magistrates, of the worst of all\noffenses--incurable stupidity in the exercise of their own vocation.\nSuch as you see me, I stand entirely alone. After years of successful\nself-dependence, the penalties of celebrity are beginning to attach to\nme. On my way from the North, I pause at this interesting city for the\nthird time; I consult my Books for the customary references to past\nlocal experience; I find under the heading, 'Personal position in York,'\nthe initials, T. W. K., signifying Too Well Known. I refer to my Index,\nand turn to the surrounding neighborhood. The same brief marks meet my\neye. 'Leeds. T. W. K.--Scarborough. T. W. K.--Harrowgate. T. W. K.'--and\nso on. What is the inevitable consequence? I suspend my proceedings; my\nresources evaporate; and my fair relative finds me the pauper gentleman\nwhom she now sees before her.\"\n\n\"Your books?\" said Magdalen. \"What books do you mean?\"\n\n\"You shall see,\" replied the captain. \"Trust me, or not, as you like--I\ntrust _you_ implicitly. You shall see.\"\n\nWith those words he retired into the back room. While he was gone,\nMagdalen stole another look at Mrs. Wragge. Was she still self-isolated\nfrom her husband's deluge of words? Perfectly self-isolated. She had\nadvanced the imaginary omelette to the last stage of culinary progress;\nand she was now rehearsing the final operation of turning it over--with\nthe palm of her hand to represent the dish, and the cookery-book to\nimpersonate the frying-pan. \"I've got it,\" said Mrs. Wragge, nodding\nacross the room at Magdalen. \"First put the frying-pan on the dish, and\nthen tumble both of them over.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge returned, carrying a neat black dispatch-box, adorned\nwith a bright brass lock. He produced from the box five or six plump\nlittle books, bound in commercial calf and vellum, and each fitted\ncomfortably with its own little lock.\n\n\"Mind!\" said the moral agriculturist, \"I take no credit to myself for\nthis: it is my nature to be orderly, and orderly I am. I must have\neverything down in black and white, or I should go mad! Here is my\ncommercial library: Daybook, Ledger, Book of Districts, Book of Letters,\nBook of Remarks, and so on. Kindly throw your eye over any one of them.\nI flatter myself there is no such thing as a blot, or a careless entry\nin it, from the first page to the last. Look at this room--is there a\nchair out of place? Not if I know it! Look at _me_. Am I dusty? am I\ndirty? am I half shaved? Am I, in brief, a speckless pauper, or am I\nnot? Mind! I take no credit to myself; the nature of the man, my dear\ngirl--the nature of the man!\"\n\nHe opened one of the books. Magdalen was no judge of the admirable\ncorrectness with which the accounts inside were all kept; but she could\nestimate the neatness of the handwriting, the regularity in the rows of\nfigures, the mathematical exactness of the ruled lines in red and black\nink, the cleanly absence of blots, stains, or erasures. Although Captain\nWragge's inborn sense of order was in him--as it is in others--a sense\ntoo inveterately mechanical to exercise any elevating moral influence\nover his actions, it had produced its legitimate effect on his habits,\nand had reduced his rogueries as strictly to method and system as if\nthey had been the commercial transactions of an honest man.\n\n\"In appearance, my system looks complicated?\" pursued the captain. \"In\nreality, it is simplicity itself. I merely avoid the errors of inferior\npractitioners. That is to say, I never plead for myself; and I\nnever apply to rich people--both fatal mistakes which the inferior\npractitioner perpetually commits. People with small means sometimes have\ngenerous impulses in connection with money--rich people, _never_. My\nlord, with forty thousand a year; Sir John, with property in half a\ndozen counties--those are the men who never forgive the genteel beggar\nfor swindling them out of a sovereign; those are the men who send for\nthe mendicity officers; those are the men who take care of their\nmoney. Who are the people who lose shillings and sixpences by sheer\nthoughtlessness? Servants and small clerks, to whom shillings and\nsixpences are of consequence. Did you ever hear of Rothschild or Baring\ndropping a fourpenny-piece down a gutter-hole? Fourpence in Rothschild's\npocket is safer than fourpence in the pocket of that woman who is crying\nstale shrimps in Skeldergate at this moment. Fortified by these sound\nprinciples, enlightened by the stores of written information in my\ncommercial library, I have ranged through the population for years past,\nand have raised my charitable crops with the most cheering success.\nHere, in book Number One, are all my Districts mapped out, with the\nprevalent public feeling to appeal to in each: Military District,\nClerical District, Agricultural District; et cetera, et cetera. Here, in\nNumber Two, are my cases that I plead: Family of an officer who fell at\nWaterloo; Wife of a poor curate stricken down by nervous debility; Widow\nof a grazier in difficulties gored to death by a mad bull; et cetera,\net cetera. Here, in Number Three, are the people who have heard of the\nofficer's family, the curate's wife, the grazier's widow, and the people\nwho haven't; the people who have said Yes, and the people who have said\nNo; the people to try again, the people who want a fresh case to stir\nthem up, the people who are doubtful, the people to beware of; et\ncetera, et cetera. Here, in Number Four, are my Adopted Handwritings\nof public characters; my testimonials to my own worth and integrity; my\nHeartrending Statements of the officer's family, the curate's wife,\nand the grazier's widow, stained with tears, blotted with emotion; et\ncetera, et cetera. Here, in Numbers Five and Six, are my own personal\nsubscriptions to local charities, actually paid in remunerative\nneighborhoods, on the principle of throwing a sprat to catch a herring;\nalso, my diary of each day's proceedings, my personal reflections and\nremarks, my statement of existing difficulties (such as the difficulty\nof finding myself T. W. K. in this interesting city); my outgivings and\nincomings; wind and weather; politics and public events; fluctuations in\nmy own health; fluctuations in Mrs. Wragge's head; fluctuations in our\nmeans and meals, our payments, prospects, and principles; et cetera,\net cetera. So, my dear girl, the Swindler's Mill goes. So you see me\nexactly as I am. You knew, before I met you, that I lived on my wits.\nWell! have I, or have I not, shown you that I have wits to live on?\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you have done yourself full justice,\" said Magdalen,\nquietly.\n\n\"I am not at all exhausted,\" continued the captain. \"I can go on, if\nnecessary, for the rest of the evening.--However, if I have do ne\nmyself full justice, perhaps I may leave the remaining points in\nmy character to develop themselves at future opportunities. For\nthe present, I withdraw myself from notice. Exit Wragge. And now to\nbusiness! Permit me to inquire what effect I have produced on your own\nmind? Do you still believe that the Rogue who has trusted you with all\nhis secrets is a Rogue who is bent on taking a mean advantage of a fair\nrelative?\"\n\n\"I will wait a little,\" Magdalen rejoined, \"before I answer that\nquestion. When I came down to tea, you told me you had been employing\nyour mind for my benefit. May I ask how?\"\n\n\"By all means,\" said Captain Wragge. \"You shall have the net result\nof the whole mental process. Said process ranges over the present and\nfuture proceedings of your disconsolate friends, and of the lawyers\nwho are helping them to find you. Their present proceedings are, in all\nprobability, assuming the following form: the lawyer's clerk has given\nyou up at Mr. Huxtable's, and has also, by this time, given you up,\nafter careful inquiry, at all the hotels. His last chance is that you\nmay send for your box to the cloak-room--you don't send for it--and\nthere the clerk is to-night (thanks to Captain Wragge and Rosemary Lane)\nat the end of his resources. He will forthwith communicate that fact to\nhis employers in London; and those employers (don't be alarmed!) will\napply for help to the detective police. Allowing for inevitable\ndelays, a professional spy, with all his wits about him, and with\nthose handbills to help him privately in identifying you, will be here\ncertainly not later than the day after tomorrow--possibly earlier. If\nyou remain in York, if you attempt to communicate with Mr. Huxtable,\nthat spy will find you out. If, on the other hand, you leave the city\nbefore he comes (taking your departure by other means than the railway,\nof course) you put him in the same predicament as the clerk--you defy\nhim to find a fresh trace of you. There is my brief abstract of your\npresent position. What do you think of it?\"\n\n\"I think it has one defect,\" said Magdalen. \"It ends in nothing.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" retorted the captain. \"It ends in an arrangement for your\nsafe departure, and in a plan for the entire gratification of your\nwishes in the direction of the stage. Both drawn from the resources of\nmy own experience, and both waiting a word from you, to be poured forth\nimmediately in the fullest detail.\"\n\n\"I think I know what that word is,\" replied Magdalen, looking at him\nattentively.\n\n\"Charmed to hear it, I am sure. You have only to say, 'Captain Wragge,\ntake charge of me'--and my plans are yours from that moment.\"\n\n\"I will take to-night to consider your proposal,\" she said, after an\ninstant's reflection. \"You shall have my answer to-morrow morning.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge looked a little disappointed. He had not expected the\nreservation on his side to be met so composedly by a reservation on\nhers.\n\n\"Why not decide at once?\" he remonstrated, in his most persuasive tones.\n\"You have only to consider--\"\n\n\"I have more to consider than you think for,\" she answered. \"I have\nanother object in view besides the object you know of.\"\n\n\"May I ask--?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Captain Wragge--you may _not_ ask. Allow me to thank you\nfor your hospitality, and to wish you good-night. I am worn out. I want\nrest.\"\n\nOnce more the captain wisely adapted himself to her humor with the ready\nself-control of an experienced man.\n\n\"Worn out, of course!\" he said, sympathetically. \"Unpardonable on my\npart not to have thought of it before. We will resume our conversation\nto-morrow. Permit me to give you a candle. Mrs. Wragge!\"\n\nProstrated by mental exertion, Mrs. Wragge was pursuing the course of\nthe omelette in dreams. Her head was twisted one way, and her body the\nother. She snored meekly. At intervals one of her hands raised itself in\nthe air, shook an imaginary frying-pan, and dropped again with a faint\nthump on the cookery-book in her lap. At the sound of her husband's\nvoice, she started to her feet, and confronted him with her mind fast\nasleep, and her eyes wide open.\n\n\"Assist Miss Vanstone,\" said the captain. \"And the next time you forget\nyourself in your chair, fall asleep straight--don't annoy me by falling\nasleep crooked.\"\n\nMrs. Wragge opened her eyes a little wider, and looked at Magdalen in\nhelpless amazement.\n\n\"Is the captain breakfasting by candle-light?\" she inquired, meekly.\n\"And haven't I done the omelette?\"\n\nBefore her husband's corrective voice could apply a fresh stimulant,\nMagdalen took her compassionately by the arm and led her out of the\nroom.\n\n\n\"Another object besides the object I know of?\" repeated Captain Wragge,\nwhen he was left by himself. \"_Is_ there a gentleman in the background,\nafter all? Is there mischief brewing in the dark that I don't bargain\nfor?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTOWARD six o'clock the next morning, the light pouring in on her face\nawoke Magdalen in the bedroom in Rosemary Lane.\n\nShe started from her deep, dreamless repose of the past night with that\npainful sense of bewilderment, on first waking, which is familiar to all\nsleepers in strange beds. \"Norah!\" she called out mechanically, when she\nopened her eyes. The next instant her mind roused itself, and her senses\ntold her the truth. She looked round the miserable room with a loathing\nrecognition of it. The sordid contrast which the place presented to\nall that she had been accustomed to see in her own bed-chamber--the\npractical abandonment, implied in its scanty furniture, of those elegant\npurities of personal habit to which she had been accustomed from her\nchildhood--shocked that sense of bodily self-respect in Magdalen which\nis a refined woman's second nature. Contemptible as the influence\nseemed, when compared with her situation at that moment, the bare\nsight of the jug and basin in a corner of the room decided her first\nresolution when she woke. She determined, then and there, to leave\nRosemary Lane.\n\nHow was she to leave it? With Captain Wragge, or without him?\n\nShe dressed herself, with a dainty shrinking from everything in the room\nwhich her hands or her clothes touched in the process, and then opened\nthe window. The autumn air felt keen and sweet; and the little patch of\nsky that she could see was warmly bright already with the new sunlight.\nDistant voices of bargemen on the river, and the chirping of birds among\nthe weeds which topped the old city wall, were the only sounds that\nbroke the morning silence. She sat down by the window; and searched her\nmind for the thoughts which she had lost, when weariness overcame her on\nthe night before.\n\nThe first subject to which she returned was the vagabond subject of\nCaptain Wragge.\n\nThe \"moral agriculturist\" had failed to remove her personal distrust of\nhim, cunningly as he had tried to plead against it by openly confessing\nthe impostures that he had practiced on others. He had raised her\nopinion of his abilities; he had amused her by his humor; he had\nastonished her by his assurance; but he had left her original conviction\nthat he was a Rogue exactly where it was when he first met with her.\nIf the one design then in her mind had been the design of going on the\nstage, she would, at all hazards, have rejected the more than doubtful\nassistance of Captain Wragge on the spot.\n\nBut the perilous journey on which she had now adventured herself had\nanother end in view--an end, dark and distant--an end, with pitfalls\nhidden on the way to it, far other than the shallow pitfalls on the\nway to the stage. In the mysterious stillness of the morning, her mind\nlooked on to its second and its deeper design, and the despicable figure\nof the swindler rose before her in a new view.\n\nShe tried to shut him out--to feel above him and beyond him again, as\nshe had felt up to this time.\n\nAfter a little trifling with her dress, she took from her bosom the\nwhite silk bag which her own hands had made on the farewell night at\nCombe-Raven. It drew together at the mouth with delicate silken strings.\nThe first thing she took out, on opening it, was a lock of Frank's hair,\ntied with a morsel of silver thread; the next was a sheet of paper\ncontaining the extracts which she had copied from her father's will and\nher father's letter; the last was a closely-folded packet of bank-notes,\nto the value of nearly two hundred pounds--the produce (as Miss Garth\nhad rightly conjectured) of the sale of her jewelry and her dresses, in\nwhich the servant at the boarding-school had privately assisted her. She\nput back the notes at once, without a second glance at them, and then\nsat looking thoughtfully at the lock of hair as it lay on her lap.\n\"You are better than nothing,\" she said, speaking to it with a girl's\nfanciful tenderness. \"I can sit and look at you sometimes, till I almost\nthink I am looking at Frank. Oh, my darling! my darling!\" Her\nvoice faltered softly, and she put the lock of hair, with a languid\ngentleness, to her lips. It fell from her fingers into her bosom. A\nlovely tinge of color rose on her cheeks, and spread downward to her\nneck, as if it followed the falling hair. She closed her eyes, and let\nher fair head droop softly. The world passed from her; and, for one\nenchanted moment, Love opened the gates of Paradise to the daughter of\nEve.\n\nThe trivial noises in the neighboring street, gathering in number as the\nmorning advanced, forced her back to the hard realities of the passing\ntime. She raised her head with a heavy sigh, and opened her eyes once\nmore on the mean and miserable little room.\n\nThe extracts from the will and the letter--those last memorials of her\nfather, now so closely associated with the purpose which had possession\nof her mind--still lay before her. The transient color faded from her\nface, as she spread the little manuscript open on her lap. The extracts\nfrom the will stood highest on the page; they were limited to those\nfew touching words in which the dead father begged his children's\nforgiveness for the stain on their birth, and implored them to remember\nthe untiring love and care by which he had striven to atone for it.\nThe extract from the letter to Mr. Pendril came next. She read the last\nmelancholy sentences aloud to herself: \"For God's sake come on the day\nwhen you receive this--come and relieve me from the dreadful thought\nthat my two darling girls are at this moment unprovided for. If anything\nhappened to me, and if my desire to do their mother justice ended\n(through my miserable ignorance of the law) in leaving Norah and\nMagdalen disinherited, I should not rest in my grave!\" Under these lines\nagain, and close at the bottom of the page, was written the terrible\ncommentary on that letter which had fallen from Mr. Pendril's lips:\n\"Mr. Vanstone's daughters are Nobody's Children, and the law leaves them\nhelpless at their uncle's mercy.\"\n\nHelpless when those words were spoken--helpless still, after all that\nshe had resolved, after all that she had sacrificed. The assertion of\nher natural rights and her sister's, sanctioned by the direct expression\nof her father's last wishes; the recall of Frank from China; the\njustification of her desertion of Norah--all hung on her desperate\npurpose of recovering the lost inheritance, at any risk, from the man\nwho had beggared and insulted his brother's children. And that man was\nstill a shadow to her! So little did she know of him that she was even\nignorant at that moment of his place of abode.\n\nShe rose and paced the room with the noiseless, negligent grace of a\nwild creature of the forest in its cage. \"How can I reach him in\nthe dark?\" she said to herself. \"How can I find out--?\" She stopped\nsuddenly. Before the question had shaped itself to an end in her\nthoughts, Captain Wragge was back in her mind again.\n\nA man well used to working in the dark; a man with endless resources\nof audacity and cunning; a man who would hesitate at no mean employment\nthat could be offered to him, if it was employment that filled his\npockets--was this the instrument for which, in its present need, her\nhand was waiting? Two of the necessities to be met, before she could\ntake a single step in advance, were plainly present to her--the\nnecessity of knowing more of her father's brother than she knew now;\nand the necessity of throwing him off his guard by concealing herself\npersonally during the process of inquiry. Resolutely self-dependent as\nshe was, the inevitable spy's work at the outset must be work delegated\nto another. In her position, was there any ready human creature within\nreach but the vagabond downstairs? Not one. She thought of it anxiously,\nshe thought of it long. Not one! There the choice was, steadily\nconfronting her: the choice of taking the Rogue, or of turning her back\non the Purpose.\n\nShe paused in the middle of the room. \"What can he do at his worst?\" she\nsaid to herself. \"Cheat me. Well! if my money governs him for me, what\nthen? Let him have my money!\" She returned mechanically to her place by\nthe window. A moment more decided her. A moment more, and she took the\nfirst fatal step downward-she determined to face the risk, and try\nCaptain Wragge.\n\nAt nine o'clock the landlady knocked at Magdalen's door, and informed\nher (with the captain's kind compliments) that breakfast was ready.\n\nShe found Mrs. Wragge alone, attired in a voluminous brown holland\nwrapper, with a limp cape and a trimming of dingy pink ribbon. The\nex-waitress at Darch's Dining-rooms was absorbed in the contemplation\nof a large dish, containing a leathery-looking substance of a mottled\nyellow color, profusely sprinkled with little black spots.\n\n\"There it is!\" said Mrs. Wragge. \"Omelette with herbs. The landlady\nhelped me. And that's what we've made of it. Don't you ask the captain\nfor any when he comes in--don't, there's a good soul. It isn't nice. We\nhad some accidents with it. It's been under the grate. It's been spilled\non the stairs. It's scalded the landlady's youngest boy--he went and sat\non it. Bless you, it isn't half as nice as it looks! Don't you ask for\nany. Perhaps he won't notice if you say nothing about it. What do you\nthink of my wrapper? I should so like to have a white one. Have you got\na white one? How is it trimmed? Do tell me!\"\n\nThe formidable entrance of the captain suspended the next question on\nher lips. Fortunately for Mrs. Wragge, her husband was far too anxious\nfor the promised expression of Magdalen's decision to pay his customary\nattention to questions of cookery. When breakfast was over, he dismissed\nMrs. Wragge, and merely referred to the omelette by telling her that she\nhad his full permission to \"give it to the dogs.\"\n\n\"How does my little proposal look by daylight?\" he asked, placing chairs\nfor Magdalen and himself. \"Which is it to be: 'Captain Wragge, take\ncharge of me?' or, 'Captain Wragge, good-morning?'\"\n\n\"You shall hear directly,\" replied Magdalen. \"I have something to say\nfirst. I told you, last night, that I had another object in view besides\nthe object of earning my living on the stage--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Captain Wragge. \"Did you say, earning\nyour living?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Both my sister and myself must depend on our own exertions\nto gain our daily bread.\"\n\n\"What!!!\" cried the captain, starting to his feet. \"The daughters of\nmy wealthy and lamented relative by marriage reduced to earn their\nown living? Impossible--wildly, extravagantly impossible!\" He sat down\nagain, and looked at Magdalen as if she had inflicted a personal injury\non him.\n\n\"You are not acquainted with the full extent of our misfortune,\" she\nsaid, quietly. \"I will tell you what has happened before I go any\nfurther.\" She told him at once, in the plainest terms she could find,\nand with as few details as possible.\n\nCaptain Wragge's profound bewilderment left him conscious of but one\ndistinct result produced by the narrative on his own mind. The lawyer's\noffer of Fifty Pounds Reward for the missing young lady ascended\ninstantly to a place in his estimation which it had never occupied until\nthat moment.\n\n\"Do I understand,\" he inquired, \"that you are entirely deprived of\npresent resources?\"\n\n\"I have sold my jewelry and my dresses,\" said Magdalen, impatient of his\nmean harping on the pecuniary string. \"If my want of experience keeps\nme back in a theater, I can afford to wait till the stage can afford to\npay me.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge mentally appraised the rings, bracelets, and necklaces,\nthe silks, satins, and laces of the daughter of a gentleman of fortune,\nat--say, a third of their real value. In a moment more, the Fifty Pounds\nReward suddenly sank again to the lowest depths in the deep estimation\nof this judicious man.\n\n\"Just so,\" he said, in his most business-like manner. \"There is not the\nleast fear, my dear girl, of your being kept back in a theater, if you\npossess present resources, and if you profit by my assistance.\"\n\n\"I must accept more assistance than you have already offered--or none,\"\nsaid Magdalen. \"I have more serious difficulties before me than the\ndifficulty of leaving York, and the difficulty of finding my way to the\nstage.\"\n\n\"You don't say so! I am all attention; pray explain yourself!\"\n\nShe considered her next words carefully before they passed her lips.\n\n\"There are certain inquiries,\" she said, \"which I am interested in\nmaking. If I undertook them myself, I should excite the suspicion of the\nperson inquired after, and should learn little or nothing of what I wish\nto know. If the inquiries could be made by a stranger, without my being\nseen in the matter, a service would be rendered me of much greater\nimportance than the service you offered last night.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge's vagabond face became gravely and deeply attentive.\n\n\"May I ask,\" he said, \"what the nature of the inquiries is likely to\nbe?\"\n\nMagdalen hesitated. She had necessarily mentioned Michael Vanstone's\nname in informing the captain of the loss of her inheritance. She must\ninevitably mention it to him again if she employed his services.\nHe would doubtless discover it for himself, by a plain process of\ninference, before she said many words more, frame them as carefully as\nshe might. Under these circumstances, was there any intelligible reason\nfor shrinking from direct reference to Michael Vanstone? No intelligible\nreason--and yet she shrank.\n\n\"For instance,\" pursued Captain Wragge, \"are they inquiries about a man\nor a woman; inquiries about an enemy or a friend--?\"\n\n\"An enemy,\" she answered, quickly.\n\nHer reply might still have kept the captain in the dark--but her eyes\nenlightened him. \"Michael Vanstone!\" thought the wary Wragge. \"She looks\ndangerous; I'll feel my way a little further.\"\n\n\"With regard, now, to the person who is the object of these inquiries,\"\nhe resumed. \"Are you thoroughly clear in your own mind about what you\nwant to know?\"\n\n\"Perfectly clear,\" replied Magdalen. \"I want to know where he lives, to\nbegin with.\"\n\n\"Yes. And after that?\"\n\n\"I want to know about his habits; about who the people are whom he\nassociates with; about what he does with his money--\" She considered a\nlittle. \"And one thing more,\" she said; \"I want to know whether there\nis any woman about his house--a relation, or a housekeeper--who has an\ninfluence over him.\"\n\n\"Harmless enough, so far,\" said the captain. \"What next?\"\n\n\"Nothing. The rest is my secret.\"\n\nThe clouds on Captain Wragge's countenance began to clear away again.\nHe reverted, with his customary precision, to his customary choice of\nalternatives. \"These inquiries of hers,\" he thought, \"mean one of two\nthings--Mischief, or Money! If it's Mischief, I'll slip through her\nfingers. If it's Money, I'll make myself useful, with a view to the\nfuture.\"\n\nMagdalen's vigilant eyes watched the progress of his reflections\nsuspiciously. \"Captain Wragge,\" she said, \"if you want time to consider,\nsay so plainly.\"\n\n\"I don't want a moment,\" replied the captain. \"Place your departure from\nYork, your dramatic career, and your private inquiries under my care.\nHere I am, unreservedly at your disposal. Say the word--do you take me?\"\n\nHer heart beat fast; her lips turned dry--but she said the word.\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nThere was a pause. Magdalen sat silent, struggling with the vague\ndread of the future which had been roused in her mind by her own\nreply. Captain Wragge, on his side, was apparently absorbed in the\nconsideration of a new set of alternatives. His hands descended into his\nempty pockets, and prophetically tested their capacity as receptacles\nfor gold and silver. The brightness of the precious metals was in his\nface, the smoothness of the precious metals was in his voice, as\nhe provided himself with a new supply of words, and resumed the\nconversation.\n\n\"The next question,\" he said, \"is the question of time. Do these\nconfidential investigations of ours require immediate attention--or can\nthey wait?\"\n\n\"For the present, they can wait,\" replied Magdalen. \"I wish to secure\nmy freedom from all interference on the part of my friends before the\ninquiries are made.\"\n\n\"Very good. The first step toward accomplishing that object is to beat\nour retreat--excuse a professional metaphor from a military man--to beat\nour retreat from York to-morrow. I see my way plainly so far; but I am\nall abroad, as we used to say in the militia, about my marching orders\nafterward. The next direction we take ought to be chosen with an eye\nto advancing your dramatic views. I am all ready, when I know what your\nviews are. How came you to think of the theater at all? I see the sacred\nfire burning in you; tell me, who lit it?\"\n\nMagdalen could only answer him in one way. She could only look back at\nthe days that were gone forever, and tell him the story of her first\nstep toward the stage at Evergreen Lodge. Captain Wragge listened\nwith his usual politeness; but he evidently derived no satisfactory\nimpression from what he heard. Audiences of friends were audiences whom\nhe privately declined to trust; and the opinion of the stage-manager was\nthe opinion of a man who spoke with his fee in his pocket and his eye on\na future engagement.\n\n\"Interesting, deeply interesting,\" he said, when Magdalen had done.\n\"But not conclusive to a practical man. A specimen of your abilities is\nnecessary to enlighten me. I have been on the stage myself; the comedy\nof the Rivals is familiar to me from beginning to end. A sample is all\nI want, if you have not forgotten the words--a sample of 'Lucy,' and a\nsample of 'Julia.'\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten the words,\" said Magdalen, sorrowfully; \"and I\nhave the little books with me in which my dialogue was written out.\nI have never parted with them; they remind me of a time--\" Her lip\ntrembled, and a pang of the heart-ache silenced her.\n\n\"Nervous,\" remarked the captain, indulgently. \"Not at all a bad sign.\nThe greatest actresses on the stage are nervous. Follow their example,\nand get over it. Where are the parts? Oh, here they are! Very nicely\nwritten, and remarkably clean. I'll give you the cues--it will all be\nover (as the dentists say) in no time. Take the back drawing-room for\nthe stage, and take me for the audience. Tingle goes the bell; up runs\nthe curtain; order in the gallery, silence in the pit--enter Lucy!\"\n\nShe tried hard to control herself; she forced back the sorrow--the\ninnocent, natural, human sorrow for the absent and the dead--pleading\nhard with her for the tears that she refused. Resolutely, with cold,\nclinched hands, she tried to begin. As the first familiar words passed\nher lips, Frank came back to her from the sea, and the face of her dead\nfather looked at her with the smile of happy old times. The voices\nof her mother and her sister talked gently in the fragrant country\nstillness, and the garden-walks at Combe-Raven opened once more on her\nview. With a faint, wailing cry, she dropped into a chair; her head fell\nforward on the table, and she burst passionately into tears.\n\nCaptain Wragge was on his feet in a moment. She shuddered as he came\nnear her, and waved him back vehemently with her hand. \"Leave me!\" she\nsaid; \"leave me a minute by myself!\" The compliant Wragge retired to\nthe front room; looked out of the window; and whistled under his breath.\n\"The family spirit again!\" he said. \"Complicated by hysterics.\"\n\nAfter waiting a minute or two he returned to make inquiries.\n\n\"Is there anything I can offer you?\" he asked. \"Cold water? burned\nfeathers? smelling salts? medical assistance? Shall I summon Mrs.\nWragge? Shall we put it off till to-morrow?\"\n\nShe started up, wild and flushed, with a desperate self-command in her\nface, with an angry resolution in her manner.\n\n\"No!\" she said. \"I must harden myself--and I will! Sit down again and\nsee me act.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" cried the captain. \"Dash at it, my beauty--and it's done!\"\n\nShe dashed at it, with a mad defiance of herself--with a raised voice,\nand a glow like fever in her cheeks. All the artless, girlish charm of\nthe performance in happier and better days was gone. The native dramatic\ncapacity that was in her came, hard and bold, to the surface, stripped\nof every softening allurement which had once adorned it. She would\nhave saddened and disappointed a man with any delicacy of feeling. She\nabsolutely electrified Captain Wragge. He forgot his politeness, he\nforgot his long words. The essential spirit of the man's whole vagabond\nlife burst out of him irresistibly in his first exclamation. \"Who the\ndevil would have thought it? She _can_ act, after all!\" The instant the\nwords escaped his lips he recovered himself, and glided off into his\nordinary colloquial channels. Magdalen stopped him in the middle of his\nfirst compliment. \"No,\" she said; \"I have forced the truth out of you\nfor once. I want no more.\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" replied the incorrigible Wragge. \"You want a little\ninstruction; and I am the man to give it you.\"\n\nWith that answer, he placed a chair for her, and proceeded to explain\nhimself.\n\nShe sat down in silence. A sullen indifference began to show itself in\nher manner; her cheeks turned pale again; and her eyes looked wearily\nvacant at the wall before her. Captain Wragge noticed these signs of\nheart-sickness and discontent with herself, after the effort she had\nmade, and saw the importance of rousing her by speaking, for once,\nplainly and directly to the point. She had set a new value on herself in\nhis mercenary eyes. She had suggested to him a speculation in her\nyouth, her beauty, and her marked ability for the stage, which had never\nentered his mind until he saw her act. The old militia-man was quick at\nhis shifts. He and his plans had both turned right about together when\nMagdalen sat down to hear what he had to say.\n\n\"Mr. Huxtable's opinion is my opinion,\" he began. \"You are a born\nactress. But you must be trained before you can do anything on the\nstage. I am disengaged--I am competent--I have trained others--I can\ntrain you. Don't trust my word: trust my eye to my own interests. I'll\nmake it my interest to take pains with you, and to be quick about it.\nYou shall pay me for my instructions from your profits on the stage.\nHalf your salary for the first year; a third of your salary for the\nsecond year; and half the sum you clear by your first benefit in a\nLondon theater. What do you say to that? Have I made it my interest to\npush you, or have I not?\"\n\nSo far as appearances went, and so far as the stage went, it was plain\nthat he had linked his interests and Magdalen's together. She briefly\ntold him so, and waited to hear more.\n\n\"A month or six weeks' study,\" continued the captain, \"will give me a\nreasonable idea of what you can do best. All ability runs in grooves;\nand your groove remains to be found. We can't find it here--for we can't\nkeep you a close prisoner for weeks together in Rosemary Lane. A quiet\ncountry place, secure from all interference and interruption, is the\nplace we want for a month certain. Trust my knowledge of Yorkshire, and\nconsider the place found. I see no difficulties anywhere, except the\ndifficulty of beating our retreat to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I thought your arrangements were made last night?\" said Magdalen.\n\n\"Quite right,\" rejoined the captain. \"They were made last night; and\nhere they are. We can't leave by railway, because the lawyer's clerk is\nsure to be on the lookout for you at the York terminus. Very good; we\ntake to the road instead, and leave in our own carriage. Where the deuce\ndo we get it? We get it from the landlady's brother, who has a horse\nand chaise which he lets out for hire. That chaise comes to the end of\nRosemary Lane at an early hour to-morrow morning. I take my wife and\nmy niece out to show them the beauties of the neighborhood. We have a\npicnic hamper with us, which marks our purpose in the public eye. You\ndisfigure yourself in a shawl, bonnet, and veil of Mrs. Wragge's; we\nturn our backs on York; and away we drive on a pleasure trip for the\nday--you and I on the front seat, Mrs. Wragge and the hamper behind.\nGood again. Once on the highroad, what do we do? Drive to the first\nstation beyond York, northward, southward, or eastward, as may be\nhereafter determined. No lawyer's clerk is waiting for you there.\nYou and Mrs. Wragge get out--first opening the hamper at a convenient\nopportunity. Instead of containing chickens and Champagne, it contains\na carpet-bag, with the things you want for the night. You take your\ntickets for a place previously determined on, and I take the chaise back\nto York. Arrived once more in this house, I collect the luggage left\nbehind, and send for the woman downstairs. 'Ladies so charmed with such\nand such a place (wrong place of course), that they have determined to\nstop there. Pray accept the customary week's rent, in place of a week's\nwarning. Good day.' Is the clerk looking for me at the York terminus?\nNot he. I take my ticket under his very nose; I follow you with the\nluggage along your line of railway--and where is the trace left of your\ndeparture? Nowhere. The fairy has vanished; and the legal authorities\nare left in the lurch.\"\n\n\"Why do you talk of difficulties?\" asked Magdalen. \"The difficulties\nseem to be provided for.\"\n\n\"All but ONE,\" said Captain Wragge, with an ominous emphasis on the\nlast word. \"The Grand Difficulty of humanity from the cradle to the\ngrave--Money.\" He slowly winked his green eye; sighed with deep feeling;\nand buried his insolvent hands in his unproductive pockets.\n\n\"What is the money wanted for?\" inquired Magdalen.\n\n\"To pay my bills,\" replied the captain, with a touching simplicity.\n\"Pray understand! I never was--and never shall be--personally desirous\nof paying a single farthing to any human creature on the habitable\nglobe. I am speaking in your interest, not in mine.\"\n\n\"My interest?\"\n\n\"Certainly. You can't get safely away from York to-morrow without the\nchaise. And I can't get the chaise without money. The landlady's brother\nwill lend it if he sees his sister's bill receipted, and if he gets his\nday's hire beforehand--not otherwise. Allow me to put the transaction\nin a business light. We have agreed that I am to be remunerated for my\ncourse of dramatic instruction out of your future earnings on the stage.\nVery good. I merely draw on my future prospects; and you, on whom those\nprospects depend, are naturally my banker. For mere argument's sake,\nestimate my share in your first year's salary at the totally inadequate\nvalue of a hundred pounds. Halve that sum; quarter that sum--\"\n\n\"How much do you want?\" said Magdalen, impatiently.\n\nCaptain Wragge was sorely tempted to take the Reward at the top of\nthe handbills as his basis of calculation. But he felt the vast future\nimportance of present moderation; and actually wanting some twelve\nor thirteen pounds, he merely doubled the amount, and said,\n\"Five-and-twenty.\"\n\nMagdalen took the little bag from her bosom, and gave him the money,\nwith a contemptuous wonder at the number of words which he had wasted on\nher for the purpose of cheating on so small a scale. In the old days at\nCombe-Raven, five-and-twenty pounds flowed from a stroke of her father's\npen into the hands of any one in the house who chose to ask for it.\n\nCaptain Wragge's eyes dwelt on the little bag as the eyes of lovers\ndwell on their mistresses. \"Happy bag!\" he murmured, as she put it back\nin her bosom. He rose; dived into a corner of the room; produced\nhis neat dispatch-box; and solemnly unlocked it on the table between\nMagdalen and himself.\n\n\"The nature of the man, my dear girl--the nature of the man,\" he said,\nopening one of his plump little books bound in calf and vellum. \"A\ntransaction has taken place between us. I must have it down in black and\nwhite.\" He opened the book at a blank page, and wrote at the top, in\na fine mercantile hand: _\"Miss Vanstone, the Younger: In account with\nHoratio Wragge, late of the Royal Militia. Dr.--Cr. Sept. 24th, 1846.\nDr.: To estimated value of H. Wragge's interest in Miss V.'s first\nyear's salary--say--200 pounds. Cr. By paid on account, 25 pounds.\"_\nHaving completed the entry--and having also shown, by doubling his\noriginal estimate on the Debtor side, that Magdalen's easy compliance\nwith his demand on her had not been thrown away on him--the captain\npressed his blotting-paper over the wet ink, and put away the book\nwith the air of a man who had done a virtuous action, and who was above\nboasting about it.\n\n\"Excuse me for leaving you abruptly,\" he said. \"Time is of importance;\nI must make sure of the chaise. If Mrs. Wragge comes in, tell her\nnothing--she is not sharp enough to be trusted. If she presumes to ask\nquestions, extinguish her immediately. You have only to be loud. Pray\ntake my authority into your own hands, and be as loud with Mrs. Wragge\nas I am!\" He snatched up his tall hat, bowed, smiled, and tripped out of\nthe room.\n\nSensible of little else but of the relief of being alone; feeling no\nmore distinct impression than the vague sense of some serious change\nhaving taken place in herself and her position, Magdalen let the events\nof the morning come and go like shadows on her mind, and waited wearily\nfor what the day might bring forth. After the lapse of some time, the\ndoor opened softly. The giant figure of Mrs. Wragge stalked into the\nroom, and stopped opposite Magdalen in solemn astonishment.\n\n\"Where are your Things?\" asked Mrs. Wragge, with a burst of\nincontrollable anxiety. \"I've been upstairs looking in your drawers.\nWhere are your night-gowns and night-caps? and your petticoats and\nstockings? and your hair-pins and bear's grease, and all the rest of\nit?\"\n\n\"My luggage is left at the railway station,\" said Magdalen.\n\nMrs. Wragge's moon-face brightened dimly. The ineradicable female\ninstinct of Curiosity tried to sparkle in her faded blue eyes--flickered\npiteously--and died out.\n\n\"How much luggage?\" she asked, confidentially. \"The captain's gone out.\nLet's go and get it!\"\n\n\"Mrs. Wragge!\" cried a terrible voice at the door.\n\nFor the first time in Magdalen's experience, Mrs. Wragge was deaf to the\ncustomary stimulant. She actually ventured on a feeble remonstrance in\nthe presence of her husband.\n\n\"Oh, do let her have her Things!\" pleaded Mrs. Wragge. \"Oh, poor soul,\ndo let her have her Things!\"\n\nThe captain's inexorable forefinger pointed to a corner of the\nroom--dropped slowly as his wife retired before it--and suddenly stopped\nat the region of her shoes.\n\n\"Do I hear a clapping on the floor!\" exclaimed Captain Wragge, with an\nexpression of horror. \"Yes; I do. Down at heel again! The left shoe\nthis time. Pull it up, Mrs. Wragge! pull it up!--The chaise will be here\nto-morrow morning at nine o'clock,\" he continued, addressing Magdalen.\n\"We can't possibly venture on claiming your box. There is note-paper.\nWrite down a list of the necessaries you want. I will take it myself\nto the shop, pay the bill for you, and bring back the parcel. We must\nsacrifice the box--we must, indeed.\"\n\nWhile her husband was addressing Magdalen, Mrs. Wragge had stolen out\nagain from her corner, and had ventured near enough to the captain to\nhear the words \"shop\" and \"parcel.\" She clapped her great hands\ntogether in ungovernable excitement, and lost all control over herself\nimmediately.\n\n\"Oh, if it's shopping, let me do it!\" cried Mrs. Wragge. \"She's going\nout to buy her Things! Oh, let me go with her--please let me go with\nher!\"\n\n\"Sit down!\" shouted the captain. \"Straight! more to the right--more\nstill. Stop where you are!\"\n\nMrs. Wragge crossed her helpless hands on her lap, and melted meekly\ninto tears.\n\n\"I do so like shopping,\" pleaded the poor creature; \"and I get so little\nof it now!\"\n\nMagdalen completed her list; and Captain Wragge at once left the room\nwith it. \"Don't let my wife bore you,\" he said, pleasantly, as he went\nout. \"Cut her short, poor soul--cut her short!\"\n\n\"Don't cry,\" said Magdalen, trying to comfort Mrs. Wragge by patting her\non the shoulder. \"When the parcel comes back you shall open it.\"\n\n\"Thank you, my dear,\" said Mrs. Wragge, meekly, drying her eyes; \"thank\nyou kindly. Don't notice my handkerchief, please. It's such a very\nlittle one! I had a nice lot of them once, with lace borders. They're\nall gone now. Never mind! It will comfort me to unpack your Things.\nYou're very good to me. I like you. I say--you won't be angry, will you?\nGive us a kiss.\"\n\nMagdalen stooped over her with the frank grace and gentleness of past\ndays, and touched her faded cheek. \"Let me do something harmless!\" she\nthought, with a pang at her heart--\"oh let me do something innocent and\nkind for the sake of old times!\"\n\nShe felt her eyes moistening, and silently turned away.\n\nThat night no rest came to her. That night the roused forces of Good\nand Evil fought their terrible fight for her soul--and left the strife\nbetween them still in suspense when morning came. As the clock of York\nMinster struck nine, she followed Mrs. Wragge to the chaise, and took\nher seat by the captain's side. In a quarter of an hour more York was\nin the distance, and the highroad lay bright and open before them in the\nmorning sunlight.\n\nTHE END OF THE SECOND SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nCHRONICLE OF EVENTS: PRESERVED IN CAPTAIN WRAGGE'S DISPATCH-BOX.\n\nI.\n\n_Chronicle for October, 1846._\n\nI HAVE retired into the bosom of my family. We are residing in the\nsecluded village of Ruswarp, on the banks of the Esk, about two miles\ninland from Whitby. Our lodgings are comfortable, and we possess the\nadditional blessing of a tidy landlady. Mrs. Wragge and Miss Vanstone\npreceded me here, in accordance with the plan I laid down for effecting\nour retreat from York. On the next day I followed them alone, with the\nluggage. On leaving the terminus, I had the satisfaction of seeing the\nlawyer's clerk in close confabulation with the detective officer whose\nadvent I had prophesied. I left him in peaceable possession of the city\nof York, and the whole surrounding neighborhood. He has returned the\ncompliment, and has left us in peaceable possession of the valley of the\nEsk, thirty miles away from him.\n\nRemarkable results have followed my first efforts at the cultivation of\nMiss Vanstone's dramatic abilities.\n\nI have discovered that she possesses extraordinary talent as a mimic.\nShe has the flexible face, the manageable voice, and the dramatic knack\nwhich fit a woman for character-parts and disguises on the stage. All\nshe now wants is teaching and practice, to make her sure of her own\nresources. The experience of her, thus gained, has revived an idea in\nmy mind which originally occurred to me at one of the \"At Homes\" of the\nlate inimitable Charles Mathews, comedian. I was in the Wine Trade at\nthe time, I remember. We imitated the Vintage-processes of Nature in\na back-kitchen at Brompton, and produced a dinner-sherry, pale and\ncurious, tonic in character, round in the mouth, a favorite with\nthe Court of Spain, at nineteen-and-sixpence a dozen, bottles\nincluded--_Vide_ Prospectus of the period. The profits of myself and\npartners were small; we were in advance of the tastes of the age, and\nin debt to the bottle merchant. Being at my wits' end for want of money,\nand seeing what audiences Mathews drew, the idea occurred to me of\nstarting an imitation of the great Imitator himself, in the shape of an\n\"At Home,\" given by a woman. The one trifling obstacle in the way was\nthe difficulty of finding the woman. From that time to this, I have\nhitherto failed to overcome it. I have conquered it at last; I have\nfound the woman now. Miss Vanstone possesses youth and beauty as well\nas talent. Train her in the art of dramatic disguise; provide her\nwith appropriate dresses for different characters; develop her\naccomplishments in singing and playing; give her plenty of smart talk\naddressed to the audience; advertise her as a Young Lady at Home;\nastonish the public by a dramatic entertainment which depends from\nfirst to last on that young lady's own sole exertions; commit the entire\nmanagement of the thing to my care--and what follows as a necessary\ncon sequence? Fame for my fair relative, and a fortune for myself.\n\nI put these considerations, as frankly as usual, to Miss Vanstone;\noffering to write the Entertainment, to manage all the business, and to\nshare the profits. I did not forget to strengthen my case by informing\nher of the jealousies she would encounter, and the obstacles she would\nmeet, if she went on the stage. And I wound up by a neat reference to\nthe private inquiries which she is interested in making, and to the\npersonal independence which she is desirous of securing before she acts\non her information. \"If you go on the stage,\" I said, \"your services\nwill be bought by a manager, and he may insist on his claims just at the\ntime when you want to get free from him. If, on the contrary, you adopt\nmy views, you will be your own mistress and your own manager, and\nyou can settle your course just as you like.\" This last consideration\nappeared to strike her. She took a day to consider it; and, when the day\nwas over, gave her consent.\n\nI had the whole transaction down in black and white immediately. Our\narrangement is eminently satisfactory, except in one particular.\nShe shows a morbid distrust of writing her name at the bottom of any\ndocument which I present to her, and roundly declares she will sign\nnothing. As long as it is her interest to provide herself with pecuniary\nresources for the future, she verbally engages to go on. When it ceases\nto be her interest, she plainly threatens to leave off at a week's\nnotice. A difficult girl to deal with; she has found out her own value\nto me already. One comfort is, I have the cooking of the accounts; and\nmy fair relative shall not fill her pockets too suddenly if I can help\nit.\n\nMy exertions in training Miss Vanstone for the coming experiment have\nbeen varied by the writing of two anonymous letters in that young lady's\ninterests. Finding her too fidgety about arranging matters with her\nfriends to pay proper attention to my instructions, I wrote anonymously\nto the lawyer who is conducting the inquiry after her, recommending him,\nin a friendly way, to give it up. The letter was inclosed to a friend\nof mine in London, with instructions to post it at Charing Cross. A week\nlater I sent a second letter, through the same channel, requesting the\nlawyer to inform me, in writing, whether he and his clients had or had\nnot decided on taking my advice. I directed him, with jocose reference\nto the collision of interests between us, to address his letter: \"Tit\nfor Tat, Post-office, West Strand.\"\n\nIn a few days the answer arrived--privately forwarded, of course, to\nPost-office, Whitby, by arrangement with my friend in London.\n\nThe lawyer's reply was short and surly: \"SIR--If my advice had been\nfollowed, you and your anonymous letter would both be treated with the\ncontempt which they deserve. But the wishes of Miss Magdalen Vanstone's\neldest sister have claims on my consideration which I cannot dispute;\nand at her entreaty I inform you that all further proceedings on my part\nare withdrawn--on the express understanding that this concession is\nto open facilities for written communication, at least, between the two\nsisters. A letter from the elder Miss Vanstone is inclosed in this. If I\ndon't hear in a week's time that it has been received, I shall place the\nmatter once more in the hands of the police.--WILLIAM PENDRIL.\" A\nsour man, this William Pendril. I can only say of him what an eminent\nnobleman once said of his sulky servant--\"I wouldn't have such a temper\nas that fellow has got for any earthly consideration that could be\noffered me!\"\n\nAs a matter of course, I looked into the letter which the lawyer\ninclosed, before delivering it. Miss Vanstone, the elder, described\nherself as distracted at not hearing from her sister; as suited with a\ngoverness's situation in a private family; as going into the situation\nin a week's time; and as longing for a letter to comfort her, before\nshe faced the trial of undertaking her new duties. After closing\nthe envelope again, I accompanied the delivery of the letter to Miss\nVanstone, the younger, by a word of caution. \"Are you more sure of your\nown courage now,\" I said, \"than you were when I met you?\" She was ready\nwith her answer. \"Captain Wragge, when you met me on the Walls of York I\nhad not gone too far to go back. I have gone too far now.\"\n\nIf she really feels this--and I think she does--her corresponding with\nher sister can do no harm. She wrote at great length the same day;\ncried profusely over her own epistolary composition; and was remarkably\nill-tempered and snappish toward me, when we met in the evening. She\nwants experience, poor girl--she sadly wants experience of the world.\nHow consoling to know that I am just the man to give it her!\n\n\nII.\n\n_Chronicle for November._\n\nWe are established at Derby. The Entertainment is written; and the\nrehearsals are in steady progress. All difficulties are provided for,\nbut the one eternal difficulty of money. Miss Vanstone's resources\nstretch easily enough to the limits of our personal wants; including\npiano-forte hire for practice, and the purchase and making of the\nnecessary dresses. But the expenses of starting the Entertainment are\nbeyond the reach of any means we possess. A theatrical friend of\nmine here, whom I had hoped to interest in our undertaking, proves,\nunhappily, to be at a crisis in his career. The field of human sympathy,\nout of which I might have raised the needful pecuniary crop, is closed\nto me from want of time to cultivate it. I see no other resource\nleft--if we are to be ready by Christmas--than to try one of the local\nmusic-sellers in this town, who is said to be a speculating man. A\nprivate rehearsal at these lodgings, and a bargain which will fill\nthe pockets of a grasping stranger--such are the sacrifices which\ndire necessity imposes on me at starting. Well! there is only one\nconsolation: I'll cheat the music-seller.\n\n\nIII.\n\n_Chronicle for December. First Fortnight._\n\nThe music-seller extorts my unwilling respect. He is one of the very few\nhuman beings I have met with in the course of my life who is not to be\ncheated. He has taken a masterly advantage of our helplessness; and has\nimposed terms on us, for performances at Derby and Nottingham, with such\na business-like disregard of all interests but his own that--fond as I\nam of putting things down in black and white--I really cannot prevail\nupon myself to record the bargain. It is needless to say, I have yielded\nwith my best grace; sharing with my fair relative the wretched pecuniary\nprospects offered to us. Our turn will come. In the meantime, I\ncordially regret not having known the local music-seller in early life.\n\nPersonally speaking, I have no cause to complain of Miss Vanstone.\nWe have arranged that she shall regularly forward her address (at the\npost-office) to her friends, as we move about from place to place.\nBesides communicating in this way with her sister, she also reports\nherself to a certain Mr. Clare, residing in Somersetshire, who is to\nforward all letters exchanged between herself and his son. Careful\ninquiry has informed me that this latter individual is now in China.\nHaving suspected from the first that there was a gentleman in the\nbackground, it is highly satisfactory to know that he recedes into the\nremote perspective of Asia. Long may he remain there!\n\nThe trifling responsibility of finding a name for our talented Magdalen\nto perform under has been cast on my shoulders. She feels no interest\nwhatever in this part of the subject. \"Give me any name you like,\" she\nsaid; \"I have as much right to one as to another. Make it yourself.\"\nI have readily consented to gratify her wishes. The resources of my\ncommercial library include a list of useful names to assume; and we can\nchoose one at five minutes' notice, when the admirable man of business\nwho now oppresses us is ready to issue his advertisements. On this point\nmy mind is easy enough: all my anxieties center in the fair performer.\nI have not the least doubt she will do wonders if she is only left to\nherself on the first night. But if the day's post is mischievous\nenough to upset her by a letter from her sister, I tremble for the\nconsequences.\n\n\nIV.\n\n_Chronicle for December. Second Fortnight._\n\nMy gifted relative has made her first appearance in public, and has laid\nthe foundation of our future fortunes.\n\nOn the first night the attendance was larger than I had ventured\nto hope. The novelty of an evening's entertainment, conducted from\nbeginning to end by the unaided exertions of a young lady (see\nadvertisement), roused the public curiosity, and the seats were\nmoderately well filled. As good luck would have it, no letter addressed\nto Miss Vanstone came that day. She was in full possession of herself\nuntil she got the first dress on and heard the bell ring for the music.\nAt that critical moment she suddenly broke down. I found her alone in\nthe waiting-room, sobbing, and talking like a child. \"Oh, poor papa!\npoor papa! Oh, my God, if he saw me now!\" My experience in such matters\nat once informed me that it was a case of sal-volatile, accompanied by\nsound advice. We strung her up in no time to concert pitch; set her eyes\nin a blaze; and made her out-blush her own rouge. The curtain rose when\nwe had got her at a red heat. She dashed at it exactly as she dashed at\nit in the back drawing-room at Rosemary Lane. Her personal appearance\nsettled the question of her reception before she opened her lips. She\nrushed full gallop through her changes of character, her songs, and her\ndialogue; making mistakes by the dozen, and never stopping to set them\nright; carrying the people along with her in a perfect whirlwind, and\nnever waiting for the applause. The whole thing was over twenty minutes\nsooner than the time we had calculated on. She carried it through to the\nend, and fainted on the waiting-room sofa a minute after the curtain\nwas down. The music-seller having taken leave of his senses from sheer\nastonishment, and I having no evening costume to appear in, we sent the\ndoctor to make the necessary apology to the public, who were calling for\nher till the place rang again. I prompted our medical orator with a neat\nspeech from behind the curtain; and I never heard such applause, from\nsuch a comparatively small audience, before in my life. I felt the\ntribute--I felt it deeply. Fourteen years ago I scraped together the\nwretched means of existence in this very town by reading the newspaper\n(with explanatory comments) to the company at a public-house. And now\nhere I am at the top of the tree.\n\nIt is needless to say that my first proceeding was to bowl out the\nmusic-seller on the spot. He called the next morning, no doubt with\na liberal proposal for extending the engagement beyond Derby and\nNottingham. My niece was described as not well enough to see him; and,\nwhen he asked for me, he was told I was not up. I happened to be at that\nmoment engaged in putting the case pathetically to our gifted Magdalen.\nHer answer was in the highest degree satisfactory. She would permanently\nengage herself to nobody--least of all to a man who had taken sordid\nadvantage of her position and mine. She would be her own mistress, and\nshare the profits with me, while she wanted money, and while it suited\nher to go on. So far so good. But the reason she added next, for her\nflattering preference of myself, was less to my taste. \"The music-seller\nis not the man whom I employ to make my inquiries,\" she said. \"You are\nthe man.\" I don't like her steadily remembering those inquiries, in the\nfirst bewilderment of her success. It looks ill for the future; it looks\ninfernally ill for the future.\n\n\nV.\n\n_Chronicle for January, 1847._\n\nShe has shown the cloven foot already. I begin to be a little afraid of\nher.\n\nOn the conclusion of the Nottingham engagement (the results of\nwhich more than equaled the results at Derby), I proposed taking the\nentertainment next--now we had got it into our own hands--to Newark.\nMiss Vanstone raised no objection until we came to the question of time,\nwhen she amazed me by stipulating for a week's delay before we appeared\nin public again.\n\n\"For what possible purpose?\" I asked.\n\n\"For the purpose of making the inquiries which I mentioned to you at\nYork,\" she answered.\n\nI instantly enlarged on the danger of delay, putting all the\nconsiderations before her in every imaginable form. She remained\nperfectly immovable. I tried to shake her on the question of expenses.\nShe answered by handing me over her share of the proceeds at Derby and\nNottingham--and there were my expenses paid, at the rate of nearly\ntwo guineas a day. I wonder who first picked out a mule as the type of\nobstinacy? How little knowledge that man must have had of women!\n\nThere was no help for it. I took down my instructions in black and\nwhite, as usual. My first exertions were to be directed to the discovery\nof Mr. Michael Vanstone's address: I was also expected to find out how\nlong he was likely to live there, and whether he had sold Combe-Raven or\nnot. My next inquiries were to inform me of his ordinary habits of life;\nof what he did with his money; of who his intimate friends were; and of\nthe sort of terms on which his son, Mr. Noel Vanstone, was now living\nwith him. Lastly, the investigations were to end in discovering\nwhether there was any female relative, or any woman exercising domestic\nauthority in the house, who was known to have an influence over either\nfather or son.\n\nIf my long practice in cultivating the field of human sympathy had\nnot accustomed me to private investigations into the affairs of other\npeople, I might have found some of these queries rather difficult to\ndeal with in the course of a week. As it was, I gave myself all the\nbenefit of my own experience, and brought the answers back to Nottingham\nin a day less than the given time. Here they are, in regular order, for\nconvenience of future reference:\n\n(1.) Mr. Michael Vanstone is now residing at German Place, Brighton, and\nlikely to remain there, as he finds the air suits him. He reached London\nfrom Switzerland in September last; and sold the Combe-Raven property\nimmediately on his arrival.\n\n(2.) His ordinary habits of life are secret and retired; he seldom\nvisits, or receives company. Part of his money is supposed to be in the\nFunds, and part laid out in railway investments, which have survived\nthe panic of eighteen hundred and forty-six, and are rapidly rising in\nvalue. He is said to be a bold speculator. Since his arrival in England\nhe has invested, with great judgment, in house property. He has\nsome houses in remote parts of London, and some houses in certain\nwatering-places on the east coast, which are shown to be advancing in\npublic repute. In all these cases he is reported to have made remarkably\ngood bargains.\n\n(3.) It is not easy to discover who his intimate friends are. Two names\nonly have been ascertained. The first is Admiral Bartram; supposed to\nhave been under friendly obligations, in past years, to Mr. Michael\nVanstone. The second is Mr. George Bartram, nephew of the Admiral, and\nnow staying on a short visit in the house at German Place. Mr. George\nBartram is the son of the late Mr. Andrew Vanstone's sister, also\ndeceased. He is therefore a cousin of Mr. Noel Vanstone's. This\nlast--viz., Mr. Noel Vanstone--is in delicate health, and is living on\nexcellent terms with his father in German Place.\n\n(4.) There is no female relative in Mr. Michael Vanstone's family\ncircle. But there is a housekeeper who has lived in his service ever\nsince his wife's death, and who has acquired a strong influence over\nboth father and son. She is a native of Switzerland, elderly, and a\nwidow. Her name is Mrs. Lecount.\n\nOn placing these particulars in Miss Vanstone's hands, she made no\nremark, except to thank me. I endeavored to invite her confidence. No\nresults; nothing but a renewal of civility, and a sudden shifting to\nthe subject of the Entertainment. Very good. If she won't give me the\ninformation I want, the conclusion is obvious--I must help myself.\n\nBusiness considerations claim the remainder of this page. Let me return\nto business.\n\n    -------------------------------------------------------Financial\n     Statement   |    Third Week in January\n    -------------------------------------------------------Place\n     Visited,     |      Perform ances,     Newark.       |        Two\n    -------------------------------------------------------Net\n     Receipts,     |      Net Receipts,  In black and white.    |\n     Actually Realized.    25 pounds      |     32 pounds 10s.\n    --------------------------------------------------------Apparent\n     Div. of Profits, |   Actual Div. of Profits,               |\n     Miss V............12 10  |   Miss V...........12 10\n     Self..............12 10  |   Self.............20 00\n    -------------------------------------------------------Private\n     Surplus on the Week,             Or say,        Self-presented\n     Testimonial.            7 pounds 10s.\n    -------------------------------------------------------Audited,\n     |     Passed correct,               |   H.

We open the first week in February.\n\n\nVI.\n\n_Chronicle for February._\n\nPractice has now given my fair relative the confidence which I predicted\nwould come with time. Her knack of disguising her own identity in\nthe impersonation of different characters so completely staggers her\naudiences that the same people come twice over to find out how she does\nit. It is the amiable defect of the English public never to know when\nthey have had enough of a good thing. They actually try to encore one\nof her characters--an old north-country lady; modeled on that honored\npreceptress in the late Mr. Vanstone's family to whom I presented myself\nat Combe-Raven. This particular performance fairly amazes the people. I\ndon't wonder at it. Such an extraordinary assumption of age by a girl of\nnineteen has never been seen in public before, in the whole course of my\ntheatrical experience.\n\nI find myself writing in a lower tone than usual; I miss my own dash of\nhumor. The fact is, I am depressed about the future. In the very height\nof our prosperity my perverse pupil sticks to her trumpery family\nquarrel. I feel myself at the mercy of the first whim in the Vanstone\ndirection which may come into her head--I, the architect of her\nfortunes. Too bad; upon my soul, too bad.\n\nShe has acted already on the inquiries which she forced me to make for\nher. She has written two letters to Mr. Michael Vanstone.\n\nTo the first letter no answer came. To the second a reply was received.\nHer infernal cleverness put an obstacle I had not expected in the way of\nmy intercepting it. Later in the day, after she had herself opened and\nread the answer, I laid another trap for her. It just succeeded, and no\nmore. I had half a minute to look into the envelope in her absence. It\ncontained nothing but her own letter returned. She is not the girl\nto put up quietly with such an insult as this. Mischief will come of\nit--Mischief to Michael Vanstone--which is of no earthly consequence:\nmischief to Me--which is a truly serious matter.\n\n\nVII.\n\n_Chronicle for March._\n\nAfter performing at Sheffield and Manchester, we have moved to\nLiverpool, Preston, and Lancaster. Another change in this weathercock of\na girl. She has written no more letters to Michael Vanstone; and she has\nbecome as anxious to make money as I am myself. We are realizing large\nprofits, and we are worked to death. I don't like this change in her:\nshe has a purpose to answer, or she would not show such extraordinary\neagerness to fill her purse. Nothing I can do--no cooking of accounts;\nno self-presented testimonials--can keep that purse empty. The success\nof the Entertainment, and her own sharpness in looking after her\ninterests, literally force me into a course of comparative honesty. She\nputs into her pocket more than a third of the profits, in defiance of my\nmost arduous exertions to prevent her. And this at my age! this after my\nlong and successful career as a moral agriculturist! Marks of admiration\nare very little things; but they express my feelings, and I put them in\nfreely.\n\n\nVIII.\n\n_Chronicle for April and May._\n\nWe have visited seven more large towns, and are now at Birmingham.\nConsulting my books, I find that Miss Vanstone has realized by the\nEntertainment, up to this time, the enormous sum of nearly four hundred\npounds. It is quite possible that my own profits may reach one or two\nmiserable hundred more. But I was the architect of her fortunes--the\npublisher, so to speak, of her book--and, if anything, I am underpaid.\n\nI made the above discovery on the twenty-ninth of the month--anniversary\nof the Restoration of my royal predecessor in the field of human\nsympathies, Charles the Second. I had barely finished locking up my\ndispatch-box, when the ungrateful girl, whose reputation I have made,\ncame into the room and told me in so many words that the business\nconnection between us was for the present at an end.\n\nI attempt no description of my own sensations: I merely record facts.\nShe informed me, with an appearance of perfect composure, that she\nneeded rest, and that she had \"new objects in view.\" She might possibly\nwant me to assist those objects; and she might possibly return to\nthe Entertainment. In either case it would be enough if we exchanged\naddresses, at which we could write to each other in case of need. Having\nno desire to leave me too abruptly, she would remain the next day (which\nwas Sunday); and would take her departure on Monday morning. Such was\nher explanation, in so many words.\n\nRemonstrance, as I knew by experience, would be thrown away. Authority I\nhad none to exert. My one sensible course to take in this emergency\nwas to find out which way my own interests pointed, and to go that way\nwithout a moment's unnecessary hesitation.\n\nA very little reflection has since convinced me that she has a deep-laid\nscheme against Michael Vanstone in view. She is young, handsome, clever,\nand unscrupulous; she has made money to live on, and has time at her\ndisposal to find out the weak side of an old man; and she is going to\nattack Mr. Michael Vanstone unawares with the legitimate weapons of her\nsex. Is she likely to want me for such a purpose as this? Doubtful. Is\nshe merely anxious to get rid of me on easy terms? Probable. Am I the\nsort of man to be treated in this way by my own pupil? Decidedly not: I\nam the man to see my way through a neat succession of alternatives; and\nhere they are:\n\nFirst alternative: To announce my compliance with her proposal; to\nexchange addresses with her; and then to keep my eye privately on all\nher future movements. Second alternative: to express fond anxiety in a\npaternal capacity; and to threaten giving the alarm to her sister and\nthe lawyer, if she persists in her design. Third alternative: to turn\nthe information I already possess to the best account, by making it a\nmarketable commodity between Mr. Michael Vanstone and myself. At present\nI incline toward the last of these three courses. But my decision is\nfar too important to be hurried. To-day is only the twenty-ninth. I will\nsuspend my Chronicle of Events until Monday.\n\n\n_May 31st_.--My alternatives and her plans are both overthrown together.\n\nThe newspaper came in, as usual, after breakfast. I looked it over, and\ndiscovered this memorable entry among the obituary announcements of the\nday:\n\n\"On the 29th inst., at Brighton, Michael Vanstone, Esq., formerly of\nZurich, aged 77.\"\n\nMiss Vanstone was present in the room when I read those two startling\nlines. Her bonnet was on; her boxes were packed; she was waiting\nimpatiently until it was time to go to the train. I handed the paper to\nher, without a word on my side. Without a word on hers, she looked where\nI pointed, and read the news of Michael Vanstone's death.\n\nThe paper dropped out of her hand, and she suddenly pulled down her\nveil. I caught one glance at her face before she hid it from me. The\neffect on my mind was startling in the extreme. To put it with my\ncustomary dash of humor--her face informed me that the most sensible\naction which Michael Vanstone, Esq., formerly of Zurich, had ever\nachieved in his life was the action he performed at Brighton on the 29th\ninstant.\n\nFinding the dead silence in the room singularly unpleasant under\nexisting circumstances, I thought I would make a remark. My regard\nfor my own interests supplied me with a subject. I mentioned the\nEntertainment.\n\n\"After what has happened,\" I said, \"I presume we go on with our\nperformances as usual?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered, behind the veil. \"We go on with my inquiries.\"\n\n\"Inquiries after a dead man?\"\n\n\"Inquiries after the dead man's son.\"\n\n\"Mr. Noel Vanstone?\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Noel Vanstone.\"\n\nNot having a veil to put down over my own face, I stooped and picked up\nthe newspaper. Her devilish determination quite upset me for the moment.\nI actually had to steady myself before I could speak to her again.\n\n\"Are the new inquiries as harmless as the old ones?\" I asked.\n\n\"Quite as harmless.\"\n\n\"What am I expected to find out?\"\n\n\"I wish to know whether Mr. Noel Vanstone remains at Brighton after the\nfuneral.\"\n\n\"And if not?\"\n\n\"If not, I shall want to know his new address wherever it may be.\"\n\n\"Yes. And what next?\"\n\n\"I wish you to find out next if all the father's money goes to the son.\"\n\nI began to see her drift. The word money relieved me; I felt quite on my\nown ground again.\n\n\"Anything more?\" I asked.\n\n\"Only one thing more,\" she answered. \"Make sure, if you please, whether\nMrs. Lecount, the housekeeper, remains or not in Mr. Noel Vanstone's\nservice.\"\n\nHer voice altered a little as she mentioned Mrs. Lecount's name; she is\nevidently sharp enough to distrust the housekeeper already.\n\n\"My expenses are to be paid as usual?\" I said.\n\n\"As usual.\"\n\n\"When am I expected to leave for Brighton?\"\n\n\"As soon as you can.\"\n\nShe rose, and left the room. After a momentary doubt, I decided on\nexecuting the new commission. The more private inquiries I conduct for\nmy fair relative the harder she will find it to get rid of hers truly,\nHoratio Wragge.\n\nThere is nothing to prevent my starting for Brighton to-morrow. So\nto-morrow I go. If Mr. Noel Vanstone succeeds to his father's property,\nhe is the only human being possessed of pecuniary blessings who fails to\ninspire me with a feeling of unmitigated envy.\n\n\nIX.\n\n_Chronicle for June_.\n\n_9th_.--I returned yesterday with my information. Here it is, privately\nnoted down for convenience of future reference:\n\nMr. Noel Vanstone has left Brighton, and has removed, for the purpose of\ntransacting business in London, to one of his late father's empty houses\nin Vauxhall Walk, Lambeth. This singularly mean selection of a place of\nresidence on the part of a gentleman of fortune looks as if Mr. N. V.\nand his money were not easily parted.\n\nMr. Noel Vanstone has stepped into his father's shoes under the\nfollowing circumstances: Mr. Michael Vanstone appears to have died,\ncuriously enough, as Mr. Andrew Vanstone died--intestate. With this\ndifference, however, in the two cases, that the younger brother left an\ninformal will, and the elder brother left no will at all. The hardest\nmen have their weaknesses; and Mr. Michael Vanstone's weakness seems to\nhave been an insurmountable horror of contemplating the event of his\nown death. His son, his housekeeper, and his lawyer, had all three tried\nover and over again to get him to make a will; and had never shaken his\nobstinate resolution to put off performing the only business duty he\nwas ever known to neglect. Two doctors attended him in his last illness;\nwarned him that he was too old a man to hope to get over it; and warned\nhim in vain. He announced his own positive determination not to die. His\nlast words in this world (as I succeeded in discovering from the nurse\nwho assisted Mrs. Lecount) were: \"I'm getting better every minute; send\nfor the fly directly and take me out for a drive.\" The same night Death\nproved to be the more obstinate of the two; and left his son (and only\nchild) to take the property in due course of law. Nobody doubts that the\nresult would have been the same if a will had been made. The father and\nson had every confidence in each other, and were known to have always\nlived together on the most friendly terms.\n\nMrs. Lecount remains with Mr. Noel Vanstone, in the same housekeeping\ncapacity which she filled with his father, and has accompanied him to\nthe new residence in Vauxhall Walk. She is acknowledged on all hands\nto have been a sufferer by the turn events have taken. If Mr. Michael\nVanstone had made his will, there is no doubt she would have received a\nhandsome legacy. She is now left dependent on Mr. Noel Vanstone's sense\nof gratitude; and she is not at all likely, I should imagine, to let\nthat sense fall asleep for want of a little timely jogging. Whether my\nfair relative's future intentions in this quarter point toward Mischief\nor Money, is more than I can yet say. In either case, I venture to\npredict that she will find an awkward obstacle in Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\nSo much for my information to the present date. The manner in which it\nwas received by Miss Vanstone showed the most ungrateful distrust of me.\nShe confided nothing to my private ear but the expression of her best\nthanks. A sharp girl--a devilish sharp girl. But there is such a thing\nas bowling a man out once too often; especially when the name of that\nman happens to be Wragge.\n\nNot a word more about the Entertainment; not a word more about moving\nfrom our present quarters. Very good. My right hand lays my left hand\na wager. Ten to one, on her opening communications with the son as she\nopened them with the father. Ten to one, on her writing to Noel Vanstone\nbefore the month is out.\n\n_21st_.--She has written by to-day's post. A long letter,\napparently--for she put two stamps on the envelope. (Private memorandum,\naddressed to myself. Wait for the answer.)\n\n_22d, 23d, 24th._--(Private memorandum continued. Wait for the answer.)\n\n_25th._--The answer has come. As an ex-military man, I have naturally\nemployed stratagem to get at it. The success which rewards all genuine\nperseverance has rewarded me--and I have got at it accordingly.\n\nThe letter is written, not by Mr. Noel Vanstone, but by Mrs. Lecount.\nShe takes the highest moral ground, in a tone of spiteful politeness.\nMr. Noel Vanstone's delicate health and recent bereavement prevent\nhim from writing himself. Any more letters from Miss Vanstone will be\nreturned unopened. Any personal application will produce an immediate\nappeal to the protection of the law. Mr. Noel Vanstone, having been\nexpressly cautioned against Miss Magdalen Vanstone by his late lamented\nfather, has not yet forgotten his father's advice. Considers it a\nreflection cast on the memory of the best of men, to suppose that his\ncourse of action toward the Misses Vanstone can be other than the\ncourse of action which his father pursued. This is what he has himself\ninstructed Mrs. Lecount to say. She has endeavored to express herself in\nthe most conciliatory language she could select; she had tried to avoid\ngiving unnecessary pain, by addressing Miss Vanstone (as a matter of\ncourtesy) by the family name; and she trusts these concessions, which\nspeak for themselves, will not be thrown away.--Such is the substance of\nthe letter, and so it ends.\n\nI draw two conclusions from this little document. First--that it will\nlead to serious results. Secondly--that Mrs. Lecount, with all her\npoliteness, is a dangerous woman to deal with. I wish I saw my way safe\nbefore me. I don't see it yet.\n\n\n_29th._--Miss Vanstone has abandoned my protection; and the whole\nlucrative future of the dramatic entertainment has abandoned me with\nher. I am swindled--I, the last man under heaven who could possibly have\nexpected to write in those disgraceful terms of myself--I AM SWINDLED!\n\nLet me chronicle the events. They exhibit me, for the time being, in a\nsadly helpless point of view. But the nature of the man prevails: I must\nhave the events down in black and white.\n\nThe announcement of her approaching departure was intimated to me\nyesterday. After another civil speech about the information I had\nprocured at Brighton, she hinted that there was a necessity for pushing\nour inquiries a little further. I immediately offered to undertake them,\nas before. \"No,\" she said; \"they are not in your way this time. They are\ninquiries relating to a woman; and I mean to make them myself!\" Feeling\nprivately convinced that this new resolution pointed straight at Mrs.\nLecount, I tried a few innocent questions on the subject. She quietly\ndeclined to answer them. I asked next when she proposed to leave. She\nwould leave on the twenty-eighth. For what destination? London. For\nlong? Probably not. By herself? No. With me? No. With whom then? With\nMrs. Wragge, if I had no objection. Good heavens! for what possible\npurpose? For the purpose of getting a respectable lodging, which she\ncould hardly expect to accomplish unless she was accompanied by an\nelderly female friend. And was I, in the capacity of elderly male\nfriend, to be left out of the business altogether? Impossible to say at\npresent. Was I not even to forward any letters which might come for her\nat our present address? No: she would make the arrangement herself at\nthe post-office; and she would ask me, at the same time, for an address,\nat which I could receive a letter from her, in case of necessity for\nfuture communication. Further inquiries, after this last answer, could\nlead to nothing but waste of time. I saved time by putting no more\nquestions.\n\nIt was clear to me that our present position toward each other was what\nour position had been previously to the event of Michael Vanstone's\ndeath. I returned, as before, to my choice of alternatives. Which\nway did my private interests point? Toward trusting the chance of her\nwanting me again? Toward threatening her with the interference of\nher relatives and friends? Or toward making the information which I\npossessed a marketable commodity between the wealthy branch of the\nfamily and myself? The last of the three was the alternative I had\nchosen in the case of the father. I chose it once more in the case of\nthe son.\n\nThe train started for London nearly four hours since, and took her away\nin it, accompanied by Mrs. Wragge.\n\nMy wife is too great a fool, poor soul, to be actively valuable in the\npresent emergency; but she will be passively useful in keeping up\nMiss Vanstone's connection with me--and, in consideration of that\ncircumstance, I consent to brush my own trousers, shave my own chin, and\nsubmit to the other inconveniences of waiting on myself for a limited\nperiod. Any faint glimmerings of sense which Mrs. Wragge may have\nformerly possessed appear to have now finally taken their leave of her.\nOn receiving permission to go to London, she favored us immediately\nwith two inquiries. Might she do some shopping? and might she leave the\ncookery-book behind her? Miss Vanstone said Yes to one question, and I\nsaid Yes to the other--and from that moment, Mrs. Wragge has existed in\na state of perpetual laughter. I am still hoarse with vainly repeated\napplications of vocal stimulant; and I left her in the railway carriage,\nto my inexpressible disgust, with _both_ shoes down at heel.\n\nUnder ordinary circumstances these absurd particulars would not have\ndwelt on my memory. But, as matters actually stand, my unfortunate\nwife's imbecility may, in her present position, lead to consequences\nwhich we none of us foresee. She is nothing more or less than a grown-up\nchild; and I can plainly detect that Miss Vanstone trusts her, as she\nwould not have trusted a sharper woman, on that very account. I know\nchildren, little and big, rather better than my fair relative does; and\nI say--beware of all forms of human innocence, when it happens to be\nyour interest to keep a secret to yourself.\n\nLet me return to business. Here I am, at two o'clock on a fine summer's\nafternoon, left entirely alone, to consider the safest means of\napproaching Mr. Noel Vanstone on my own account. My private suspicions\nof his miserly character produce no discouraging effect on me. I have\nextracted cheering pecuniary results in my time from people quite as\nfond of their money as he can be. The real difficulty to contend with is\nthe obstacle of Mrs. Lecount. If I am not mistaken, this lady merits a\nlittle serious consideration on my part. I will close my chronicle for\nto-day, and give Mrs. Lecount her due.\n\n\n_Three o'clock._--I open these pages again to record a discovery which\nhas taken me entirely by surprise.\n\nAfter completing the last entry, a circumstance revived in my memory\nwhich I had noticed on escorting the ladies this morning to the railway.\nI then remarked that Miss Vanstone had only taken one of her three boxes\nwith her--and it now occurred to me that a private investigation of the\nluggage she had left behind might possibly be attended with beneficial\nresults. Having, at certain periods of my life been in the habit of\ncultivating friendly terms with strange locks, I found no difficulty in\nestablishing myself on a familiar footing with Miss Vanstone's boxes.\nOne of the two presented nothing to interest me. The other--devoted\nto the preservation of the costumes, articles of toilet, and other\nproperties used in the dramatic Entertainment--proved to be better worth\nexamining: for it led me straight to the discovery of one of its owner's\nsecrets.\n\nI found all the dresses in the box complete--with one remarkable\nexception. That exception was the dress of the old north-country lady;\nthe character which I have already mentioned as the best of all my\npupil's disguises, and as modeled in voice and manner on her old\ngoverness, Miss Garth. The wig; the eyebrows; the bonnet and veil; the\ncloak, padded inside to disfigure her back and shoulders; the paints and\ncosmetics used to age her face and alter her complexion--were all gone.\nNothing but the gown remained; a gaudily-flowered silk, useful enough\nfor dramatic purposes, but too extravagant in color and pattern to bear\ninspection by daylight. The other parts of the dress are sufficiently\nquiet to pass muster; the bonnet and veil are only old-fashioned, and\nthe cloak is of a sober gray color. But one plain inference can be drawn\nfrom such a discovery as this. As certainly as I sit here, she is\ngoing to open the campaign against Noel Vanstone and Mrs. Lecount in\na character which neither of those two persons can have any possible\nreason for suspecting at the outset--the character of Miss Garth.\n\nWhat course am I to take under these circumstances? Having got her\nsecret, what am I to do with it? These are awkward considerations; I am\nrather puzzled how to deal with them.\n\nIt is something more than the mere fact of her choosing to disguise\nherself to forward her own private ends that causes my present\nperplexity. Hundreds of girls take fancies for disguising themselves;\nand hundreds of instances of it are related year after year in the\npublic journals. But my ex-pupil is not to be confounded for one moment\nwith the average adventuress of the newspapers. She is capable of\ngoing a long way beyond the limit of dressing herself like a man, and\nimitating a man's voice and manner. She has a natural gift for assuming\ncharacters which I have never seen equaled by a woman; and she has\nperformed in public until she has felt her own power, and trained her\ntalent for disguising herself to the highest pitch. A girl who takes the\nsharpest people unawares by using such a capacity as this to help\nher own objects in private life, and who sharpens that capacity by a\ndetermination to fight her way to her own purpose, which has beaten down\neverything before it, up to this time--is a girl who tries an experiment\nin deception, new enough and dangerous enough to lead, one way or the\nother, to very serious results. This is my conviction, founded on a\nlarge experience in the art of imposing on my fellow-creatures. I say of\nmy fair relative's enterprise what I never said or thought of it till I\nintroduced myself to the inside of her box. The chances for and against\nher winning the fight for her lost fortune are now so evenly balanced\nthat I cannot for the life of me see on which side the scale inclines.\nAll I can discern is, that it will, to a dead certainty, turn one way or\nthe other on the day when she passes Noel Vanstone's doors in disguise.\n\nWhich way do my interests point now? Upon my honor, I don't know.\n\n\n_Five o'clock._--I have effected a masterly compromise; I have decided\non turning myself into a Jack-o n-both-sides.\n\nBy to-day's post I have dispatched to London an anonymous letter for M\nr. Noel Vanstone. It will be forwarded to its destination by the same\nmeans which I successfully adopted to mystify Mr. Pendril; and it will\nreach Vauxhall Walk, Lambeth, by the afternoon of to-morrow at the\nlatest.\n\nThe letter is short, and to the purpose. It warns Mr. Noel Vanstone, in\nthe most alarming language, that he is destined to become the victim\nof a conspiracy; and that the prime mover of it is a young lady who\nhas already held written communication with his father and himself.\nIt offers him the information necessary to secure his own safety, on\ncondition that he makes it worth the writer's while to run the serious\npersonal risk which such a disclosure will entail on him. And it ends by\nstipulating that the answer shall be advertised in the _Times_; shall\nbe addressed to \"An Unknown Friend\"; and shall state plainly what\nremuneration Mr. Noel Vanstone offers for the priceless service which it\nis proposed to render him.\n\nUnless some unexpected complication occurs, this letter places me\nexactly in the position which it is my present interest to occupy. If\nthe advertisement appears, and if the remuneration offered is large\nenough to justify me in going over to the camp of the enemy, over I go.\nIf no advertisement appears, or if Mr. Noel Vanstone rates my invaluable\nassistance at too low a figure, here I remain, biding my time till my\nfair relative wants me, or till I make her want me, which comes to\nthe same thing. If the anonymous letter falls by any accident into her\nhands, she will find disparaging allusions in it to myself, purposely\nintroduced to suggest that the writer must be one of the persons whom\nI addressed while conducting her inquiries. If Mrs. Lecount takes\nthe business in hand and lays a trap for me--I decline her tempting\ninvitation by becoming totally ignorant of the whole affair the instant\nany second person appears in it. Let the end come as it may, here I am\nready to profit by it: here I am, facing both ways, with perfect ease\nand security--a moral agriculturist, with his eye on two crops at once,\nand his swindler's sickle ready for any emergency.\n\nFor the next week to come, the newspaper will be more interesting to me\nthan ever. I wonder which side I shall eventually belong to?\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE THIRD SCENE.\n\nVAUXHALL WALK, LAMBETH.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE old Archiepiscopal Palace of Lambeth, on the southern bank of the\nThames--with its Bishop's Walk and Garden, and its terrace fronting the\nriver--is an architectural relic of the London of former times, precious\nto all lovers of the picturesque, in the utilitarian London of the\npresent day. Southward of this venerable structure lies the street\nlabyrinth of Lambeth; and nearly midway, in that part of the maze of\nhouses which is placed nearest to the river, runs the dingy double row\nof buildings now, as in former days, known by the name of Vauxhall Walk.\n\nThe network of dismal streets stretching over the surrounding\nneighborhood contains a population for the most part of the poorer\norder. In the thoroughfares where shops abound, the sordid struggle with\npoverty shows itself unreservedly on the filthy pavement; gathers its\nforces through the week; and, strengthening to a tumult on Saturday\nnight, sees the Sunday morning dawn in murky gaslight. Miserable women,\nwhose faces never smile, haunt the butchers' shops in such London\nlocalities as these, with relics of the men's wages saved from the\npublic-house clutched fast in their hands, with eyes that devour the\nmeat they dare not buy, with eager fingers that touch it covetously,\nas the fingers of their richer sisters touch a precious stone. In this\ndistrict, as in other districts remote from the wealthy quarters of the\nmetropolis, the hideous London vagabond--with the filth of the street\noutmatched in his speech, with the mud of the street outdirtied in his\nclothes--lounges, lowering and brutal, at the street corner and the\ngin-shop door; the public disgrace of his country, the unheeded warning\nof social troubles that are yet to come. Here, the loud self-assertion\nof Modern Progress--which has reformed so much in manners, and altered\nso little in men--meets the flat contradiction that scatters its\npretensions to the winds. Here, while the national prosperity feasts,\nlike another Belshazzar, on the spectacle of its own magnificence, is\nthe Writing on the Wall, which warns the monarch, Money, that his glory\nis weighed in the balance, and his power found wanting.\n\nSituated in such a neighborhood as this, Vauxhall Walk gains by\ncomparison, and establishes claims to respectability which no impartial\nobservation can fail to recognize. A large proportion of the Walk is\nstill composed of private houses. In the scattered situations where\nshops appear, those shops are not besieged by the crowds of more\npopulous thoroughfares. Commerce is not turbulent, nor is the public\nconsumer besieged by loud invitations to \"buy.\" Bird-fanciers have\nsought the congenial tranquillity of the scene; and pigeons coo,\nand canaries twitter, in Vauxhall Walk. Second-hand carts and cabs,\nbedsteads of a certain age, detached carriage-wheels for those who\nmay want one to make up a set, are all to be found here in the same\nrepository. One tributary stream, in the great flood of gas which\nilluminates London, tracks its parent source to Works established in\nthis locality. Here the followers of John Wesley have set up a temple,\nbuilt before the period of Methodist conversion to the principles of\narchitectural religion. And here--most striking object of all--on the\nsite where thousands of lights once sparkled; where sweet sounds of\nmusic made night tuneful till morning dawned; where the beauty and\nfashion of London feasted and danced through the summer seasons of a\ncentury--spreads, at this day, an awful wilderness of mud and rubbish;\nthe deserted dead body of Vauxhall Gardens mouldering in the open air.\n\n\nOn the same day when Captain Wragge completed the last entry in his\nChronicle of Events, a woman appeared at the window of one of the houses\nin Vauxhall Walk, and removed from the glass a printed paper which\nhad been wafered to it announcing that Apartments were to be let. The\napartments consisted of two rooms on the first floor. They had just been\ntaken for a week certain by two ladies who had paid in advance--those\ntwo ladies being Magdalen and Mrs. Wragge.\n\nAs soon as the mistress of the house had left the room, Magdalen walked\nto the window, and cautiously looked out from it at the row of buildings\nopposite. They were of superior pretensions in size and appearance to\nthe other houses in the Walk: the date at which they had been erected\nwas inscribed on one of them, and was stated to be the year 1759. They\nstood back from the pavement, separated from it by little strips of\ngarden-ground. This peculiarity of position, added to the breadth of the\nroadway interposing between them and the smaller houses opposite,\nmade it impossible for Magdalen to see the numbers on the doors, or\nto observe more of any one who might come to the windows than the bare\ngeneral outline of dress and figure. Nevertheless, there she stood,\nanxiously fixing her eyes on one house in the row, nearly opposite to\nher--the house she had looked for before entering the lodgings; the\nhouse inhabited at that moment by Noel Vanstone and Mrs. Lecount.\n\nAfter keeping watch at the window in silence for ten minutes or more,\nshe suddenly looked back into the room, to observe the effect which her\nbehavior might have produced on her traveling companion.\n\nNot the slightest cause appeared for any apprehension in that quarter.\nMrs. Wragge was seated at the table absorbed in the arrangement of\na series of smart circulars and tempting price-lists, issued by\nadvertising trades-people, and flung in at the cab-windows as they left\nthe London terminus. \"I've often heard tell of light reading,\" said Mrs.\nWragge, restlessly shifting the positions of the circulars as a child\nrestlessly shifts the position of a new set of toys. \"Here's light\nreading, printed in pretty colors. Here's all the Things I'm going to\nbuy when I'm out shopping to-morrow. Lend us a pencil, please--you won't\nbe angry, will you? I do so want to mark 'em off.\" She looked up at\nMagdalen, chuckled joyfully over her own altered circumstances, and\nbeat her great hands on the table in irrepressible delight. \"No\ncookery-book!\" cried Mrs. Wragge. \"No Buzzing in my head! no captain to\nshave to-morrow! I'm all down at heel; my cap's on one side; and nobody\nbawls at me. My heart alive, here _is_ a holiday and no mistake!\"\nHer hands began to drum on the table louder than ever, until Magdalen\nquieted them by presenting her with a pencil. Mrs. Wragge instantly\nrecovered her dignity, squared her elbows on the table, and plunged into\nimaginary shopping for the rest of the evening.\n\nMagdalen returned to the window. She took a chair, seated herself\nbehind the curtain, and steadily fixed her eyes once more on the house\nopposite.\n\nThe blinds were down over the windows of the first floor and the second.\nThe window of the room on the ground-floor was uncovered and partly\nopen, but no living creature came near it. Doors opened, and people came\nand went, in the houses on either side; children by the dozen poured out\non the pavement to play, and invaded the little strips of garden-ground\nto recover lost balls and shuttlecocks; streams of people passed\nbackward and forward perpetually; heavy wagons piled high with goods\nlumbered along the road on their way to, or their way from, the railway\nstation near; all the daily life of the district stirred with its\nceaseless activity in every direction but one. The hours passed--and\nthere was the house opposite still shut up, still void of any signs of\nhuman existence inside or out. The one object which had decided Magdalen\non personally venturing herself in Vauxhall Walk--the object of studying\nthe looks, manners and habits of Mrs. Lecount and her master from a post\nof observation known only to herself--was thus far utterly defeated.\nAfter three hours' watching at the window, she had not even discovered\nenough to show her that the house was inhabited at all.\n\nShortly after six o'clock, the landlady disturbed Mrs. Wragge's studies\nby spreading the cloth for dinner. Magdalen placed herself at the table\nin a position which still enabled her to command the view from the\nwindow. Nothing happened. The dinner came to an end; Mrs. Wragge (lulled\nby the narcotic influence of annotating circulars, and eating and\ndrinking with an appetite sharpened by the captain's absence) withdrew\nto an arm-chair, and fell asleep in an attitude which would have caused\nher husband the acutest mental suffering; seven o'clock struck; the\nshadows of the summer evening lengthened stealthily on the gray pavement\nand the brown house-walls--and still the closed door opposite remained\nshut; still the one window open showed nothing but the black blank of\nthe room inside, lifeless and changeless as if that room had been a\ntomb.\n\nMrs. Wragge's meek snoring deepened in tone; the evening wore on\ndrearily; it was close on eight o'clock--when an event happened at last.\nThe street door opposite opened for the first time, and a woman appeared\non the threshold.\n\nWas the woman Mrs. Lecount? No. As she came nearer, her dress showed her\nto be a servant. She had a large door-key in her hand, and was evidently\ngoing out to perform an errand. Roused partly by curiosity, partly by\nthe impulse of the moment, which urged her impetuous nature into action\nafter the passive endurance of many hours past, Magdalen snatched up\nher bonnet, and determined to follow the servant to her destination,\nwherever it might be.\n\nThe woman led her to the great thoroughfare of shops close at hand,\ncalled Lambeth Walk. After proceeding some little distance, and looking\nabout her with the hesitation of a person not well acquainted with the\nneighborhood, the servant crossed the road and entered a stationer's\nshop. Magdalen crossed the road after her and followed her in.\n\nThe inevitable delay in entering the shop under these circumstances\nmade Magdalen too late to hear what the woman asked for. The first words\nspoken, however, by the man behind the counter reached her ears, and\ninformed her that the servant's object was to buy a railway guide.\n\n\"Do you mean a Guide for this month or a Guide for July?\" asked the\nshopman, addressing his customer.\n\n\"Master didn't tell me which,\" answered the woman. \"All I know is, he's\ngoing into the country the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\"The day after to-morrow is the first of July,\" said the shopman. \"The\nGuide your master wants is the Guide for the new month. It won't be\npublished till to-morrow.\"\n\nEngaging to call again on the next day, the servant left the shop, and\ntook the way that led back to Vauxhall Walk.\n\nMagdalen purchased the first trifle she saw on the counter, and hastily\nreturned in the same direction. The discovery she had just made was of\nvery serious importance to her; and she felt the necessity of acting on\nit with as little delay as possible.\n\nOn entering the front room at the lodgings she found Mrs. Wragge just\nawake, lost in drowsy bewilderment, with her cap fallen off on her\nshoulders, and with one of her shoes missing altogether. Magdalen\nendeavored to persuade her that she was tired after her journey, and\nthat her wisest proceeding would be to go to bed. Mrs. Wragge was\nperfectly willing to profit by this suggestion, provided she could find\nher shoe first. In looking for the shoe, she unfortunately discovered\nthe circulars, put by on a side-table, and forthwith recovered her\nrecollection of the earlier proceedings of the evening.\n\n\"Give us the pencil,\" said Mrs. Wragge, shuffling the circulars in a\nviolent hurry. \"I can't go to bed yet--I haven't half done marking\ndown the things I want. Let's see; where did I leave off? _Try Finch's\nfeeding-bottle for Infants._ No! there's a cross against that: the cross\nmeans I don't want it. _Comfort in the Field. Buckler's Indestructible\nHunting-breeches._ Oh dear, dear! I've lost the place. No, I haven't.\nHere it is; here's my mark against it. _Elegant Cashmere Robes; strictly\nOriental, very grand; reduced to one pound nineteen-and-sixpence. Be in\ntime. Only three left._ Only three! Oh, do lend us the money, and let's\ngo and get one!\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" said Magdalen. \"Suppose you go to bed now, and finish\nthe circulars tomorrow? I will put them by the bedside for you, and you\ncan go on with them as soon as you wake the first thing in the morning.\"\n\nThis suggestion met with Mrs. Wragge's immediate approval. Magdalen took\nher into the next room and put her to bed like a child--with her toys\nby her side. The room was so narrow, and the bed was so small; and Mrs.\nWragge, arrayed in the white apparel proper for the occasion, with her\nmoon-face framed round by a spacious halo of night-cap, looked so hugely\nand disproportionately large, that Magdalen, anxious as she was, could\nnot repress a smile on taking leave of her traveling companion for the\nnight.\n\n\"Aha!\" cried Mrs. Wragge, cheerfully; \"we'll have that Cashmere Robe\nto-morrow. Come here! I want to whisper something to you. Just you look\nat me--I'm going to sleep crooked, and the captain's not here to bawl at\nme!\"\n\n\nThe front room at the lodgings contained a sofa-bedstead which the\nlandlady arranged betimes for the night. This done, and the candles\nbrought in, Magdalen was left alone to shape the future course as her\nown thoughts counseled her.\n\nThe questions and answers which had passed in her presence that evening\nat the stationer's shop led plainly to the conclusion that one day more\nwould bring Noel Vanstone's present term of residence in Vauxhall Walk\nto an end. Her first cautious resolution to pass many days together\nin unsuspected observation of the house opposite before she ventured\nherself inside was entirely frustrated by the turn events had taken. She\nwas placed in the dilemma of running all risks headlong on the next day,\nor of pausing for a future opportunity which might never occur. There\nwas no middle course open to her. Until she had seen Noel Vanstone with\nher own eyes, and had discovered the worst there was to fear from Mrs.\nLecount--until she had achieved t his double object, with the needful\nprecaution of keeping her own identity carefully in the dark--not a step\ncould she advance toward the accomplishment of the purpose which had\nbrought her to London.\n\nOne after another the minutes of the night passed away; one after\nanother the thronging thoughts followed each other over her mind--and\nstill she reached no conclusion; still she faltered and doubted, with a\nhesitation new to her in her experience of herself. At last she crossed\nthe room impatiently to seek the trivial relief of unlocking her trunk\nand taking from it the few things that she wanted for the night. Captain\nWragge's suspicions had not misled him. There, hidden between two\ndresses, were the articles of costume which he had missed from her box\nat Birmingham. She turned them over one by one, to satisfy herself that\nnothing she wanted had been forgotten, and returned once more to her\npost of observation by the window.\n\nThe house opposite was dark down to the parlor. There the blind,\npreviously raised, was now drawn over the window: the light burning\nbehind it showed her for the first time that the room was inhabited. Her\neyes brightened, and her color rose as she looked at it.\n\n\"There he is!\" she said to herself, in a low, angry whisper. \"There he\nlives on our money, in the house that his father's warning has closed\nagainst me!\" She dropped the blind which she had raised to look out,\nreturned to her trunk, and took from it the gray wig which was part of\nher dramatic costume in the character of the North-country lady. The wig\nhad been crumpled in packing; she put it on and went to the toilet-table\nto comb it out. \"His father has warned him against Magdalen Vanstone,\"\nshe said, repeating the passage in Mrs. Lecount's letter, and laughing\nbitterly, as she looked at herself in the glass. \"I wonder whether his\nfather has warned him against Miss Garth? To-morrow is sooner than I\nbargained for. No matter: to-morrow shall show.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE early morning, when Magdalen rose and looked out, was cloudy and\novercast. But as time advanced to the breakfast hour the threatening of\nrain passed away; and she was free to provide, without hinderance\nfrom the weather, for the first necessity of the day--the necessity of\nsecuring the absence of her traveling companion from the house.\n\nMrs. Wragge was dressed, armed at all points with her collection of\ncirculars, and eager to be away by ten o'clock. At an earlier hour\nMagdalen had provided for her being properly taken care of by the\nlandlady's eldest daughter--a quiet, well-conducted girl, whose interest\nin the shopping expedition was readily secured by a little present of\nmoney for the purchase, on her own account, of a parasol and a muslin\ndress. Shortly after ten o'clock Magdalen dismissed Mrs. Wragge and her\nattendant in a cab. She then joined the landlady--who was occupied in\nsetting the rooms in order upstairs--with the object of ascertaining,\nby a little well-timed gossip, what the daily habits might be of the\ninmates of the house.\n\nShe discovered that there were no other lodgers but Mrs. Wragge and\nherself. The landlady's husband was away all day, employed at a railway\nstation. Her second daughter was charged with the care of the kitchen\nin the elder sister's absence. The younger children were at school, and\nwould be back at one o'clock to dinner. The landlady herself \"got up\nfine linen for ladies,\" and expected to be occupied over her work all\nthat morning in a little room built out at the back of the premises.\nThus there was every facility for Magdalen's leaving the house in\ndisguise, and leaving it unobserved, provided she went out before the\nchildren came back to dinner at one o'clock.\n\nBy eleven o'clock the apartments were set in order, and the landlady had\nretired to pursue her own employments. Magdalen softly locked the door\nof her room, drew the blind over the window, and entered at once on her\npreparations for the perilous experiment of the day.\n\nThe same quick perception of dangers to be avoided and difficulties to\nbe overcome which had warned her to leave the extravagant part of her\ncharacter costume in the box at Birmingham now kept her mind fully alive\nto the vast difference between a disguise worn by gas-light for the\namusement of an audience and a disguise assumed by daylight to deceive\nthe searching eyes of two strangers. The first article of dress which\nshe put on was an old gown of her own (made of the material called\n\"alpaca\"), of a dark-brown color, with a neat pattern of little\nstar-shaped spots in white. A double flounce running round the bottom\nof this dress was the only milliner's ornament which it presented--an\nornament not at all out of character with the costume appropriated to an\nelderly lady. The disguise of her head and face was the next object of\nher attention. She fitted and arranged the gray wig with the dexterity\nwhich constant practice had given her; fixed the false eyebrows (made\nrather large, and of hair darker than the wig) carefully in their\nposition with the gum she had with her for the purpose, and stained her\nface with the customary stage materials, so as to change the transparent\nfairness of her complexion to the dull, faintly opaque color of a woman\nin ill health. The lines and markings of age followed next; and here\nthe first obstacles presented themselves. The art which succeeded by\ngas-light failed by day: the difficulty of hiding the plainly artificial\nnature of the marks was almost insuperable. She turned to her trunk;\ntook from it two veils; and putting on her old-fashioned bonnet, tried\nthe effect of them in succession. One of the veils (of black lace)\nwas too thick to be worn over the face at that summer season without\nexciting remark. The other, of plain net, allowed her features to\nbe seen through it, just indistinctly enough to permit the safe\nintroduction of certain lines (many fewer than she was accustomed to\nuse in performing the character) on the forehead and at the sides of\nthe mouth. But the obstacle thus set aside only opened the way to a\nnew difficulty--the difficulty of keeping her veil down while she was\nspeaking to other persons, without any obvious reason for doing so. An\ninstant's consideration, and a chance look at her little china palette\nof stage colors, suggested to her ready invention the production of a\nvisible excuse for wearing her veil. She deliberately disfigured herself\nby artificially reddening the insides of her eyelids so as to produce\nan appearance of inflammation which no human creature but a doctor--and\nthat doctor at close quarters--could have detected as false. She sprang\nto her feet and looked triumphantly at the hideous transformation of\nherself reflected in the glass. Who could think it strange now if she\nwore her veil down, and if she begged Mrs. Lecount's permission to sit\nwith her back to the light?\n\nHer last proceeding was to put on the quiet gray cloak which she had\nbrought from Birmingham, and which had been padded inside by Captain\nWragge's own experienced hands, so as to hide the youthful grace and\nbeauty of her back and shoulders. Her costume being now complete, she\npracticed the walk which had been originally taught her as appropriate\nto the character--a walk with a slight limp--and, returning to the glass\nafter a minute's trial, exercised herself next in the disguise of her\nvoice and manner. This was the only part of the character in which\nit had been possible, with her physical peculiarities, to produce an\nimitation of Miss Garth; and here the resemblance was perfect. The harsh\nvoice, the blunt manner, the habit of accompanying certain phrases by an\nemphatic nod of the head, the Northumbrian _burr_ expressing itself\nin every word which contained the letter \"r\"--all these personal\npeculiarities of the old North-country governess were reproduced to\nthe life. The personal transformation thus completed was literally\nwhat Captain Wragge had described it to be--a triumph in the art of\nself-disguise. Excepting the one case of seeing her face close, with\na strong light on it, nobody who now looked at Magdalen could have\nsuspected for an instant that she was other than an ailing, ill-made,\nunattractive woman of fifty years old at least.\n\nBefore unlocking the door, she looked about her carefully, to make\nsure that none of her stage materials were exposed to view in case the\nlandlady entered the room in her absence. The only forgotten object\nbelonging to her that she discovered was a little packet of Norah's\nletters which she had been reading overnight, and which had been\naccidentally pushed under the looking-glass while she was engaged in\ndressing herself. As she took up the letters to put them away, the\nthought struck her for the first time, \"Would Norah know me now if\nwe met each other in the street?\" She looked in the glass, and smiled\nsadly. \"No,\" she said, \"not even Norah.\"\n\nShe unlocked the door, after first looking at her watch. It was close\non twelve o'clock. There was barely an hour left to try her desperate\nexperiment, and to return to the lodging before the landlady's children\ncame back from school.\n\nAn instant's listening on the landing assured her that all was quiet in\nthe passage below. She noiselessly descended the stairs and gained the\nstreet without having met any living creature on her way out of the\nhouse. In another minute she had crossed the road, and had knocked at\nNoel Vanstone's door.\n\nThe door was opened by the same woman-servant whom she had followed on\nthe previous evening to the stationer's shop. With a momentary tremor,\nwhich recalled the memorable first night of her appearance in public,\nMagdalen inquired (in Miss Garth's voice, and with Miss Garth's manner)\nfor Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Mrs. Lecount has gone out, ma'am,\" said the servant.\n\n\"Is Mr. Vanstone at home?\" asked Magdalen, her resolution asserting\nitself at once against the first obstacle that opposed it.\n\n\"My master is not up yet, ma'am.\"\n\nAnother check! A weaker nature would have accepted the warning.\nMagdalen's nature rose in revolt against it.\n\n\"What time will Mrs. Lecount be back?\" she asked.\n\n\"About one o'clock, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Say, if you please, that I will call again as soon after one o'clock\nas possible. I particularly wish to see Mrs. Lecount. My name is Miss\nGarth.\"\n\nShe turned and left the house. Going back to her own room was out of the\nquestion. The servant (as Magdalen knew by not hearing the door close)\nwas looking after her; and, moreover, she would expose herself, if she\nwent indoors, to the risk of going out again exactly at the time when\nthe landlady's children were sure to be about the house. She turned\nmechanically to the right, walked on until she recalled Vauxhall Bridge,\nand waited there, looking out over the river.\n\nThe interval of unemployed time now before her was nearly an hour. How\nshould she occupy it?\n\nAs she asked herself the question, the thought which had struck her when\nshe put away the packet of Norah's letters rose in her mind once more. A\nsudden impulse to test the miserable completeness of her disguise mixed\nwith the higher and purer feeling at her heart, and strengthened her\nnatural longing to see her sister's face again, though she dare not\ndiscover herself and speak. Norah's later letters had described, in the\nfullest details, her life as a governess--her hours for teaching, her\nhours of leisure, her hours for walking out with her pupils. There was\njust time, if she could find a vehicle at once, for Magdalen to drive\nto the house of Norah's employer, with the chance of getting there a few\nminutes before the hour when her sister would be going out. \"One look at\nher will tell me more than a hundred letters!\" With that thought in her\nheart, with the one object of following Norah on her daily walk, under\nprotection of the disguise, Magdalen hastened over the bridge, and made\nfor the northern bank of the river.\n\nSo, at the turning-point of her life--so, in the interval before she\ntook the irrevocable step, and passed the threshold of Noel Vanstone's\ndoor--the forces of Good triumphing in the strife for her over the\nforces of Evil, turned her back on the scene of her meditated deception,\nand hurried her mercifully further and further away from the fatal\nhouse.\n\n\nShe stopped the first empty cab that passed her; told the driver to go\nto New Street, Spring Gardens; and promised to double his fare if he\nreached his destination by a given time. The man earned the money--more\nthan earned it, as the event proved. Magdalen had not taken ten steps\nin advance along New Street, walking toward St. James's Park, before\nthe door of a house beyond her opened, and a lady in mourning came out,\naccompanied by two little girls. The lady also took the direction of\nthe Park, without turning her head toward Magdalen as she descended\nthe house step. It mattered little; Magdalen's heart looked through her\neyes, and told her that she saw Norah.\n\nShe followed them into St. James's Park, and thence (along the Mall)\ninto the Green Park, venturing closer and closer as they reached the\ngrass and ascended the rising ground in the direction of Hyde Park\nCorner. Her eager eyes devoured every detail in Norah's dress, and\ndetected the slightest change that had taken place in her figure and\nher bearing. She had become thinner since the autumn--her head drooped\na little; she walked wearily. Her mourning dress, worn with the modest\ngrace and neatness which no misfortune could take from her, was suited\nto her altered station; her black gown was made of stuff; her black\nshawl and bonnet were of the plainest and cheapest kind. The two little\ngirls, walking on either side of her, were dressed in silk. Magdalen\ninstinctively hated them.\n\nShe made a wide circuit on the grass, so as to turn gradually and meet\nher sister without exciting suspicion that the meeting was contrived.\nHer heart beat fast; a burning heat glowed in her as she thought of her\nfalse hair, her false color, her false dress, and saw the dear familiar\nface coming nearer and nearer. They passed each other close. Norah's\ndark gentle eyes looked up, with a deeper light in them, with a sadder\nbeauty than of old--rested, all unconscious of the truth, on her\nsister's face--and looked away from it again as from the face of a\nstranger. That glance of an instant struck Magdalen to the heart. She\nstood rooted to the ground after Norah had passed by. A horror of the\nvile disguise that concealed her; a yearning to burst its trammels and\nhide her shameful painted face on Norah's bosom, took possession of her,\nbody and soul. She turned and looked back.\n\nNorah and the two children had reached the higher ground, and were close\nto one of the gates in the iron railing which fenced the Park from the\nstreet. Drawn by an irresistible fascination, Magdalen followed them\nagain, gained on them as they reached the gate, and heard the voices of\nthe two children raised in angry dispute which way they wanted to walk\nnext. She saw Norah take them through the gate, and then stoop and speak\nto them, while waiting for an opportunity to cross the road. They only\ngrew the louder and the angrier for what she said. The youngest--a girl\nof eight or nine years old--flew into a child's vehement passion, cried,\nscreamed, and even kicked at the governess. The people in the street\nstopped and laughed; some of them jestingly advised a little wholesome\ncorrection; one woman asked Norah if she was the child's mother; another\npitied her audibly for being the child's governess. Before Magdalen\ncould push her way through the crowd--before her all-mastering anxiety\nto help her sister had blinded her to every other consideration, and had\nbrought her, self-betrayed, to Norah's side--an open carriage passed\nthe pavement slowly, hindered in its progress by the press of vehicles\nbefore it. An old lady seated inside heard the child's cries, recognized\nNorah, and called to her immediately. The footman parted the crowd, and\nthe children were put into the carriage. \"It's lucky I happened to pass\nthis way,\" said the old lady, beckoning contemptuously to Norah to\ntake her place on the front seat; \"you never could manage my daughter's\nchildren, and you never will.\" The footman put up the steps, the\ncarriage drove on with the children and the governess, the crowd\ndispersed, and Magdalen was alone again.\n\n\n\"So be it!\" she thought, bitterly. \"I should only have distressed her.\nWe should only have had the misery of parting to suffer again.\"\n\nShe mechanically retraced her steps; she returned, as in a dream, to the\nopen space of the Park. Arming itself treacherously with the strength of\nher love for her sister, with the vehemence of the indignation that she\nfelt for her sister's sake, the terrible temptation of her life fastened\nits hold on her more firmly than ever. Through all the paint and\ndisfigurement of the disguise, the fierce despair of that strong and\npassionate nature lowered, haggard and horrible. Norah made an object\nof public curiosity and amusement; Norah reprimanded in the open street;\nNorah, the hired victim of an old woman's insolence and a child's\nill-temper, and the same man to thank for it who had sent Frank to\nChina!--and that man's son to thank after him! The thought of her\nsister, which had turned her from the scene of her meditated deception,\nwhich had made the consciousness of her own disguise hateful to her, was\nnow the thought which sanctioned that means, or any means, to compass\nher end; the thought which set wings to her feet, and hurried her back\nnearer and nearer to the fatal house.\n\n\nShe left the Park again, and found herself in the streets without\nknowing where. Once more she hailed the first cab that passed her, and\ntold the man to drive to Vauxhall Walk.\n\nThe change from walking to riding quieted her. She felt her attention\nreturning to herself and her dress. The necessity of making sure that no\naccident had happened to her disguise in the interval since she had left\nher own room impressed itself immediately on her mind. She stopped\nthe driver at the first pastry-cook's shop which he passed, and there\nobtained the means of consulting a looking-glass before she ventured\nback to Vauxhall Walk.\n\nHer gray head-dress was disordered, and the old-fashioned bonnet was\na little on one side. Nothing else had suffered. She set right the few\ndefects in her costume, and returned to the cab. It was half-past one\nwhen she approached the house and knocked, for the second time, at Noel\nVanstone's door. The woman-servant opened it as before.\n\n\"Has Mrs. Lecount come back?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. Step this way, if you please.\"\n\nThe servant preceded Magdalen along an empty passage, and, leading her\npast an uncarpeted staircase, opened the door of a room at the back of\nthe house. The room was lighted by one window looking out on a yard;\nthe walls were bare; the boarded floor was uncovered. Two bedroom chairs\nstood against the wall, and a kitchen-table was placed under the window.\nOn the table stood a glass tank filled with water, and ornamented in the\nmiddle by a miniature pyramid of rock-work interlaced with weeds. Snails\nclung to the sides of the tank; tadpoles and tiny fish swam swiftly in\nthe green water, slippery efts and slimy frogs twined their noiseless\nway in and out of the weedy rock-work; and on top of the pyramid there\nsat solitary, cold as the stone, brown as the stone, motionless as the\nstone, a little bright-eyed toad. The art of keeping fish and reptiles\nas domestic pets had not at that time been popularized in England;\nand Magdalen, on entering the room, started back, in irrepressible\nastonishment and disgust, from the first specimen of an Aquarium that\nshe had ever seen.\n\n\"Don't be alarmed,\" said a woman's voice behind her. \"My pets hurt\nnobody.\"\n\nMagdalen turned, and confronted Mrs. Lecount. She had expected--founding\nher anticipations on the letter which the housekeeper had written to\nher--to see a hard, wily, ill-favored, insolent old woman. She found\nherself in the presence of a lady of mild, ingratiating manners, whose\ndress was the perfection of neatness, taste, and matronly simplicity,\nwhose personal appearance was little less than a triumph of physical\nresistance to the deteriorating influence of time. If Mrs. Lecount had\nstruck some fifteen or sixteen years off her real age, and had asserted\nherself to be eight-and-thirty, there would not have been one man in a\nthousand, or one woman in a hundred, who would have hesitated to believe\nher. Her dark hair was just turning to gray, and no more. It was plainly\nparted under a spotless lace cap, sparingly ornamented with mourning\nribbons. Not a wrinkle appeared on her smooth white forehead, or her\nplump white cheeks. Her double chin was dimpled, and her teeth were\nmarvels of whiteness and regularity. Her lips might have been critically\nconsidered as too thin, if they had not been accustomed to make the best\nof their defects by means of a pleading and persuasive smile. Her large\nblack eyes might have looked fierce if they had been set in the face of\nanother woman, they were mild and melting in the face of Mrs. Lecount;\nthey were tenderly interested in everything she looked at--in Magdalen,\nin the toad on the rock-work, in the back-yard view from the window; in\nher own plump fair hands,--which she rubbed softly one over the other\nwhile she spoke; in her own pretty cambric chemisette, which she had\na habit of looking at complacently while she listened to others. The\nelegant black gown in which she mourned the memory of Michael Vanstone\nwas not a mere dress--it was a well-made compliment paid to Death. Her\ninnocent white muslin apron was a little domestic poem in itself. Her\njet earrings were so modest in their pretensions that a Quaker might\nhave looked at them and committed no sin. The comely plumpness of\nher face was matched by the comely plumpness of her figure; it glided\nsmoothly over the ground; it flowed in sedate undulations when she\nwalked. There are not many men who could have observed Mrs. Lecount\nentirely from the Platonic point of view--lads in their teens would\nhave found her irresistible--women only could have hardened their hearts\nagainst her, and mercilessly forced their way inward through that fair\nand smiling surface. Magdalen's first glance at this Venus of the autumn\nperiod of female life more than satisfied her that she had done well\nto feel her ground in disguise before she ventured on matching herself\nagainst Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Have I the pleasure of addressing the lady who called this morning?\"\ninquired the housekeeper. \"Am I speaking to Miss Garth?\"\n\nSomething in the expression of her eyes, as she asked that question,\nwarned Magdalen to turn her face further inward from the window than she\nhad turned it yet. The bare doubt whether the housekeeper might not have\nseen her already under too strong a light shook her self-possession for\nthe moment. She gave herself time to recover it, and merely answered by\na bow.\n\n\"Accept my excuses, ma'am, for the place in which I am compelled to\nreceive you,\" proceeded Mrs. Lecount in fluent English, spoken with a\nforeign accent. \"Mr. Vanstone is only here for a temporary purpose. We\nleave for the sea-side to-morrow afternoon, and it has not been thought\nworth while to set the house in proper order. Will you take a seat, and\noblige me by mentioning the object of your visit?\"\n\nShe glided imperceptibly a step or two nearer to Magdalen, and placed\na chair for her exactly opposite the light from the window. \"Pray sit\ndown,\" said Mrs. Lecount, looking with the tenderest interest at the\nvisitor's inflamed eyes through the visitor's net veil.\n\n\"I am suffering, as you see, from a complaint in the eyes,\" replied\nMagdalen, steadily keeping her profile toward the window, and carefully\npitching her voice to the tone of Miss Garth's. \"I must beg your\npermission to wear my veil down, and to sit away from the light.\"\nShe said those words, feeling mistress of herself again. With perfect\ncomposure she drew the chair back into the corner of the room beyond the\nwindow and seated herself, keeping the shadow of her bonnet well over\nher face. Mrs. Lecount's persuasive lips murmured a polite expression\nof sympathy; Mrs. Lecount's amiable black eyes looked more interested in\nthe strange lady than ever. She placed a chair for herself exactly on\na line with Magdalen's, and sat so close to the wall as to force her\nvisitor either to turn her head a little further round toward the\nwindow, or to fail in politeness by not looking at the person whom she\naddressed. \"Yes,\" said Mrs. Lecount, with a confidential little cough.\n\"And to what circumstances am I indebted for the honor of this visit?\"\n\n\"May I inquire, first, if my name happens to be familiar to you?\"\nsaid Magdalen, turning toward her as a matter of necessity, but coolly\nholding up her handkerchief at the same time between her face and the\nlight.\n\n\"No,\" answered Mrs. Lecount, with another little cough, rather harsher\nthan the first. \"The name of Miss Garth is not familiar to me.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" pursued Magdalen, \"I shall best explain the object that\ncauses me to intrude on you by mentioning who I am. I lived for many\nyears as governess in the family of the late Mr. Andrew Vanstone, of\nCombe-Raven, and I come here in the interest of his orphan daughters.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount's hands, which had been smoothly sliding one over the\nother up to this time, suddenly stopped; and Mrs. Lecount's lips,\nself-forgetfully shutting up, owned they were too thin at the very\noutset of the interview.\n\n\"I am surprised you can bear the light out-of-doors without a\ngreen shade,\" she quietly remarked; leaving the false Miss Garth's\nannouncement of herself as completely unnoticed as it she had not spoken\nat all.\n\n\"I find a shade over my eyes keeps them too hot at this time of the\nyear,\" rejoined Magdalen, steadily matching the housekeeper's composure.\n\"May I ask whether you heard what I said just now on the subject of my\nerrand in this house?\"\n\n\"May I inquire on my side, ma'am, in what way that errand can possibly\nconcern _me?_\" retorted Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Magdalen. \"I come to you because Mr. Noel Vanstone's\nintentions toward the two young ladies were made known to them in the\nform of a letter from yourself.\"\n\nThat plain answer had its effect. It warned Mrs. Lecount that the\nstrange lady was better informed than she had at first suspected, and\nthat it might hardly be wise, under the circumstances, to dismiss her\nunheard.\n\n\"Pray pardon me,\" said the housekeeper, \"I scarcely understood before;\nI perfectly understand now. You are mistaken, ma'am, in supposing that\nI am of any importance, or that I exercise any influence in this painful\nmatter. I am the mouth-piece of Mr. Noel Vanstone; the pen he holds, if\nyou will excuse the expression--nothing more. He is an invalid, and like\nother invalids, he has his bad days and his good. It was his bad day\nwhen that answer was written to the young person--shall I call her\nMiss Vanstone? I will, with pleasure, poor girl; for who am I to make\ndistinctions, and what is it to me whether her parents were married or\nnot? As I was saying, it was one of Mr. Noel Vanstone's bad days when\nthat answer was sent, and therefore I had to write it; simply as his\nsecretary, for want of a better. If you wish to speak on the subject of\nthese young ladies--shall I call them young ladies, as you did just now?\nno, poor things, I will call them the Misses Vanstone.--If you wish to\nspeak on the subject of these Misses Vanstone, I will mention your name,\nand your object in favoring me with this call, to Mr. Noel Vanstone.\nHe is alone in the parlor, and this is one of his good days. I have the\ninfluence of an old servant over him, and I will use that influence\nwith pleasure in your behalf. Shall I go at once?\" asked Mrs. Lecount,\nrising, with the friendliest anxiety to make herself useful.\n\n\"If you please,\" replied Magdalen; \"and if I am not taking any undue\nadvantage of your kindness.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \"you are laying me under an\nobligation--you are permitting me, in my very limited way, to assist the\nperformance of a benevolent action.\" She bowed, smiled, and glided out\nof the room.\n\nLeft by herself, Magdalen allowed the anger which she had suppressed\nin Mrs. Lecount's presence to break free from her. For want of a nobler\nobject to attack, it took the direction of the toad. The sight of the\nhideous little reptile sitting placid on his rock throne, with his\nbright eyes staring impenetrably into vacancy, irritated every nerve\nin her body. She looked at the creature with a shrinking intensity of\nhatred; she whispered at it maliciously through her set teeth. \"I wonder\nwhose blood runs coldest,\" she said, \"yours, you little monster, or Mrs.\nLecount's? I wonder which is the slimiest, her heart or your back? You\nhateful wretch, do you know what your mistress is? Your mistress is a\ndevil!\"\n\nThe speckled skin under the toad's mouth mysteriously wrinkled itself,\nthen slowly expanded again, as if he had swallowed the words just\naddressed to him. Magdalen started back in disgust from the first\nperceptible movement in the creature's body, trifling as it was, and\nreturned to her chair. She had not seated herself again a moment too\nsoon. The door opened noiselessly, and Mrs. Lecount appeared once more.\n\n\"Mr. Vanstone will see you,\" she said, \"if you will kindly wait a few\nminutes. He will ring the parlor bell when his present occupation is\nat an end, and he is ready to receive you. Be careful, ma'am, not to\ndepress his spirits, nor to agitate him in any way. His heart has been\na cause of serious anxiety to those about him, from his earliest years.\nThere is no positive disease; there is only a chronic feebleness--a\nfatty degeneration--a want of vital power in the organ itself. His heart\nwill go on well enough if you don't give his heart too much to do--that\nis the advice of all the medical men who have seen him. You will not\nforget it, and you will keep a guard over your conversation accordingly.\nTalking of medical men, have you ever tried the Golden Ointment for that\nsad affliction in your eyes? It has been described to me as an excellent\nremedy.\"\n\n\"It has not succeeded in my case,\" replied Magdalen, sharply. \"Before I\nsee Mr. Noel Vanstone,\" she continued, \"may I inquire--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Mrs. Lecount. \"Does your question refer\nin any way to those two poor girls?\"\n\n\"It refers to the Misses Vanstone.\"\n\n\"Then I can't enter into it. Excuse me, I really can't discuss these\npoor girls (I am so glad to hear you call them the Misses Vanstone!)\nexcept in my master's presence, and by my master's express permission.\nLet us talk of something else while we are waiting here. Will you notice\nmy glass Tank? I have every reason to believe that it is a perfect\nnovelty in England.\"\n\n\"I looked at the tank while you were out of the room,\" said Magdalen.\n\n\"Did you? You take no interest in the subject, I dare say? Quite\nnatural. I took no interest either until I was married. My dear\nhusband--dead many years since--formed my tastes and elevated me to\nhimself. You have heard of the late Professor Lecomte, the eminent Swiss\nnaturalist? I am his widow. The English circle at Zurich (where I\nlived in my late master's service) Anglicized my name to Lecount. Your\ngenerous country people will have nothing foreign about them--not even\na name, if they can help it. But I was speaking of my husband--my dear\nhusband, who permitted me to assist him in his pursuits. I have had only\none interest since his death--an interest in science. Eminent in many\nthings, the professor was great at reptiles. He left me his Subjects\nand his Tank. I had no other legacy. There is the Tank. All the Subjects\ndied but this quiet little fellow--this nice little toad. Are you\nsurprised at my liking him? There is nothing to be surprised at. The\nprofessor lived long enough to elevate me above the common prejudice\nagainst the reptile creation. Properly understood, the reptile creation\nis beautiful. Properly dissected, the reptile creation is instructive\nin the last degree.\" She stretched out her little finger, and gently\nstroked the toad's back with the tip of it. \"So refreshing to the\ntouch,\" said Mrs. Lecount--\"so nice and cool this summer weather!\"\n\nThe bell from the parlor rang. Mrs. Lecount rose, bent fondly over the\nAquarium, and chirruped to the toad at parting as if it had been a bird.\n\"Mr. Vanstone is ready to receive you. Follow me, if you please, Miss\nGarth.\" With these words she opened the door, and led the way out of the\nroom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\n\"MISS GARTH, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, opening the parlor door, and\nannouncing the visitor's appearance with the tone and manner of a\nwell-bred servant.\n\nMagdalen found herself in a long, narrow room, consisting of a back\nparlor and a front parlor, which had been thrown into one by opening the\nfolding-doors between them. Seated not far from the front window, with\nhis back to the light, she saw a frail, flaxen-haired, self-satisfied\nlittle man, clothed in a fair white dressing-gown many sizes too large\nfor him, with a nosegay of violets drawn neatly through the button-hole\nover his breast. He looked from thirty to five-and-thirty years old.\nHis complexion was as delicate as a young girl's, his eyes were of\nthe lightest blue, his upper lip was adorned by a weak little white\nmustache, waxed and twisted at either end into a thin spiral curl. When\nany object specially attracted his attention he half closed his eyelids\nto look at it. When he smiled, the skin at his temples crumpled itself\nup into a nest of wicked little wrinkles. He had a plate of strawberries\non his lap, with a napkin under them to preserve the purity of his white\ndressing-gown. At his right hand stood a large round table, covered with\na collection of foreign curiosities, which seemed to have been brought\ntogether from the four quarters of the globe. Stuffed birds from Africa,\nporcelain monsters from China, silver ornaments and utensils from India\nand Peru, mosaic work from Italy, and bronzes from France, were all\nheaped together pell-mell with the coarse deal boxes and dingy\nleather cases which served to pack them for traveling. The little man\napologized, with a cheerful and simpering conceit, for his litter of\ncuriosities, his dressing-gown, and his delicate health; and, waving his\nhand toward a chair, placed his attention, with pragmatical politeness,\nat the visitor's disposal. Magdalen looked at him with a momentary\ndoubt whether Mrs. Lecount had not deceived her. Was this the man who\nmercilessly followed the path on which his merciless father had walked\nbefore him? She could hardly believe it. \"Take a seat, Miss Garth,\" he\nrepeated, observing her hesitation, and announcing his own name in a\nhigh, thin, fretfully-consequential voice: \"I am Mr. Noel Vanstone. You\nwished to see me--here I am!\"\n\n\"May I be permitted to retire, sir?\" inquired Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Certainly not!\" replied her master. \"Stay here, Lecount, and keep\nus company. Mrs. Lecount has my fullest confidence,\" he continued,\naddressing Magdalen. \"Whatever you say to me, ma'am, you say to her. She\nis a domestic treasure. There is not another house in England has such a\ntreasure as Mrs. Lecount.\"\n\nThe housekeeper listened to the praise of her domestic virtues with\neyes immovably fixed on her elegant chemisette. But Magdalen's quick\npenetration had previously detected a look that passed between Mrs.\nLecount and her master, which suggested that Noel Vanstone had been\ninstructed beforehand what to say and do in his visitor's presence.\nThe suspicion of this, and the obstacles which the room presented to\narranging her position in it so as to keep her face from the light,\nwarned Magdalen to be on her guard.\n\nShe had taken her chair at first nearly midway in the room. An instant's\nafter-reflection induced her to move her seat toward the left hand, so\nas to place herself just inside, and close against, the left post of the\nfolding-door. In this position she dexterously barred the only passage\nby which Mrs. Lecount could have skirted round the large table and\ncontrived to front Magdalen by taking a chair at her master's side. On\nthe right hand of the table the empty space was well occupied by\nthe fireplace and fender, by some traveling-trunks, and a large\npacking-case. There was no alternative left for Mrs. Lecount but to\nplace herself on a line with Magdalen against the opposite post of\nthe folding-door, or to push rudely past the visitor with the obvious\nintention of getting in front of her. With an expressive little cough,\nand with one steady look at her master, the housekeeper conceded the\npoint, and took her seat against the right-hand door-post. \"Wait a\nlittle,\" thought Mrs. Lecount; \"my turn next!\"\n\n\"Mind what you are about, ma'am!\" cried Noel Vanstone, as Magdalen\naccidentally approached the table in moving her chair. \"Mind the\nsleeve of your cloak! Excuse me, you nearly knocked down that silver\ncandlestick. Pray don't suppose it's a common candlestick. It's nothing\nof the sort--it's a Peruvian candlestick. There are only three of that\npattern in the world. One is in the possession of the President of Peru;\none is locked up in the Vatican; and one is on My table. It cost ten\npounds; it's worth fifty. One of my father's bargains, ma'am. All these\nthings are my father's bargains. There is not another house in England\nwhich has such curiosities as these. Sit down, Lecount; I beg you will\nmake yourself comfortable. Mrs. Lecount is like the curiosities, Miss\nGarth--she is one of my father's bargains. You are one of my father's\nbargains, are you not, Lecount? My father was a remarkable man,\nma'am. You will be reminded of him here at every turn. I have got his\ndressing-gown on at this moment. No such linen as this is made now--you\ncan't get it for love or money. Would you like to feel the texture?\nPerhaps you're no judge of texture? Perhaps you would prefer talking to\nme about these two pupils of yours? They are two, are they not? Are they\nfine girls? Plump, fresh, full-blown English beauties?\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" interposed Mrs. Lecount, sorrowfully. \"I must really\nbeg permission to retire if you speak of the poor things in that way.\nI can't sit by, sir, and hear them turned into ridicule. Consider their\nposition; consider Miss Garth.\"\n\n\"You good creature!\" said Noel Vanstone, surveying the housekeeper\nthrough his half-closed eyelids. \"You excellent Lecount! I assure you,\nma'am, Mrs. Lecount is a worthy creature. You will observe that she\npities the two girls. I don't go so far as that myself, but I can make\nallowances for them. I am a large-minded man. I can make allowances\nfor them and for you.\" He smiled with the most cordial politeness, and\nhelped himself to a strawberry from the dish on his lap.\n\n\"You shock Miss Garth; indeed, sir, without meaning it, you shock Miss\nGarth,\" remonstrated Mrs. Lecount. \"She is not accustomed to you as I\nam. Consider Miss Garth, sir. As a favor to _me_, consider Miss Garth.\"\n\nThus far Magdalen had resolutely kept silence. The burning anger, which\nwould have betrayed her in an instant if she had let it flash its way\nto the surface, throbbed fast and fiercely at her heart, and warned\nher, while Noel Vanstone was speaking, to close her lips. She would have\nallowed him to talk on uninterruptedly for some minutes more if Mrs.\nLecount had not interfered for the second time. The refined insolence\nof the housekeeper's pity was a woman's insolence; and it stung her into\ninstantly controlling herself. She had never more admirably imitated\nMiss Garth's voice and manner than when she spoke her next words.\n\n\"You are very good,\" she said to Mrs. Lecount. \"I make no claim to be\ntreated with any extraordinary consideration. I am a governess, and I\ndon't expect it. I have only one favor to ask. I beg Mr. Noel Vanstone,\nfor his own sake, to hear what I have to say to him.\"\n\n\"You understand, sir?\" observed Mrs. Lecount. \"It appears that Miss\nGarth has some serious warning to give you. She says you are to hear\nher, for your own sake.\"\n\nMr. Noel Vanstone's fair complexion suddenly turned white. He put away\nthe plate of strawberries among his father's bargains. His hand shook\nand his little figure twisted itself uneasily in the chair. Magdalen\nobserved him attentively. \"One discovery already,\" she thought; \"he is a\ncoward!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, ma'am?\" asked Noel Vanstone, with visible trepidation\nof look and manner. \"What do you mean by telling me I must listen to you\nfor my own sake? If you come her to intimidate me, you come to the wrong\nman. My strength of character was universally noticed in our circle at\nZurich--wasn't it, Lecount?\"\n\n\"Universally, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"But let us hear Miss Garth.\nPerhaps I have misinterpreted her meaning.\"\n\n\"On the contrary,\" replied Magdalen, \"you have exactly expressed my\nmeaning. My object in coming here is to warn Mr. Noel Vanstone against\nthe course which he is now taking.\"\n\n\"Don't!\" pleaded Mrs. Lecount. \"Oh, if you want to help these poor\ngirls, don't talk in that way! Soften his resolution, ma'am, by\nentreaties; don't strengthen it by threats!\" She a little overstrained\nthe tone of humility in which she spoke those words--a little overacted\nthe look of apprehension which accompanied them. If Magdalen had not\nseen plainly enough already that it was Mrs. Lecount's habitual practice\nto decide everything for her master in the first instance, and then to\npersuade him that he was not acting under his housekeeper's resolution\nbut under his own, she would have seen it now.\n\n\"You hear what Lecount has just said?\" remarked Noel Vanstone. \"You hear\nthe unsolicited testimony of a person who has known me from childhood?\nTake care, Miss Garth--take care!\" He complacently arranged the tails\nof his white dressing-gown over his knees and took the plate of\nstrawberries back on his lap.\n\n\"I have no wish to offend you,\" said Magdalen. \"I am only anxious to\nopen your eyes to the truth. You are not acquainted with the characters\nof the two sisters whose fortunes have fallen into your possession. I\nhave known them from childhood; and I come to give you the benefit of\nmy experience in their interests and in yours. You have nothing to dread\nfrom the elder of the two; she patiently accepts the hard lot which you,\nand your father before you, have forced on her. The younger sister's\nconduct is the very opposite of this. She has already declined to submit\nto your father's decision, and she now refuses to be silenced by Mrs.\nLecount's letter. Take my word for it, she is capable of giving you\nserious trouble if you persist in making an enemy of her.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone changed color once more, and began to fidget again in his\nchair. \"Serious trouble,\" he repeated, with a blank look. \"If you mean\nwriting letters, ma'am, she has given trouble enough already. She has\nwritten once to me, and twice to my father. One of the letters to my\nfather was a threatening letter--wasn't it, Lecount?\"\n\n\"She expressed her feelings, poor child,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"I thought\nit hard to send her back her letter, but your dear father knew best.\nWhat I said at the time was, Why not let her express her feelings? What\nare a few threatening words, after all? In her position, poor creature,\nthey are words, and nothing more.\"\n\n\"I advise you not to be too sure of that,\" said Magdalen. \"I know her\nbetter than you do.\"\n\nShe paused at those words--paused in a momentary terror. The sting of\nMrs. Lecount's pity had nearly irritated her into forgetting her assumed\ncharacter, and speaking in her own voice.\n\n\"You have referred to the letters written by my pupil,\" she resumed,\naddressing Noel Vanstone as soon as she felt sure of herself again. \"We\nwill say nothing about what she has written to your father; we will only\nspeak of what she has written to you. Is there anything unbecoming in\nher letter, anything said in it that is false? Is it not true that these\ntwo sisters have been cruelly deprived of the provision which their\nfather made for them? His will to this day speaks for him and for them;\nand it only speaks to no purpose, because he was not aware that his\nmarriage obliged him to make it again, and because he died before he\ncould remedy the error. Can you deny that?\"\n\nNoel Vanstone smiled, and helped himself to a strawberry. \"I don't\nattempt to deny it,\" he said. \"Go on, Miss Garth.\"\n\n\"Is it not true,\" persisted Magdalen, \"that the law which has taken\nthe money from these sisters, whose father made no second will, has now\ngiven that very money to you, whose father made no will at all? Surely,\nexplain it how you may, this is hard on those orphan girls?\"\n\n\"Very hard,\" replied Noel Vanstone. \"It strikes you in that light,\ntoo--doesn't it, Lecount?\"\n\nMrs. Lecount shook her head, and closed her handsome black eyes.\n\"Harrowing,\" she said; \"I can characterize it, Miss Garth, by no other\nword--harrowing. How the young person--no! how Miss Vanstone, the\nyounger--discovered that my late respected master made no will I am at\na loss to understand. Perhaps it was put in the papers? But I am\ninterrupting you, Miss Garth. Do have something more to say about your\npupil's letter?\" She noiselessly drew her chair forward, as she said\nthese words, a few inches beyond the line of the visitor's chair. The\nattempt was neatly made, but it proved useless. Magdalen only kept her\nhead more to the left, and the packing-case on the floor prevented Mrs.\nLecount from advancing any further.\n\n\"I have only one more question to put,\" said Magdalen. \"My pupil's\nletter addressed a proposal to Mr. Noel Vanstone. I beg him to inform me\nwhy he has refused to consider it.\"\n\n\"My good lady!\" cried Noel Vanstone, arching his white eyebrows in\nsatirical astonishment. \"Are you really in earnest? Do you know what the\nproposal is? Have you seen the letter?\"\n\n\"I am quite in earnest,\" said Magdalen, \"and I have seen the letter. It\nentreats you to remember how Mr. Andrew Vanstone's fortune has come\ninto your hands; it informs you that one-half of that fortune, divided\nbetween his daughters, was what his will intended them to have; and it\nasks of your sense of justice to do for his children what he would have\ndone for them himself if he had lived. In plainer words still, it asks\nyou to give one-half of the money to the daughters, and it leaves you\nfree to keep the other half yourself. That is the proposal. Why have you\nrefused to consider it?\"\n\n\"For the simplest possible reason, Miss Garth,\" said Noel Vanstone, in\nhigh good-humor. \"Allow me to remind you of a well-known proverb: A fool\nand his money are soon parted. Whatever else I may be, ma'am, I'm not a\nfool.\"\n\n\"Don't put it in that way, sir!\" remonstrated Mrs. Lecount. \"Be\nserious--pray be serious!\"\n\n\"Quite impossible, Lecount,\" rejoined her master. \"I can't be serious.\nMy poor father, Miss Garth, took a high moral point of view in this\nmatter. Lecount, there, takes a high moral point of view--don't\nyou, Lecount? I do nothing of the sort. I have lived too long in the\nContinental atmosphere to trouble myself about moral points of view. My\ncourse in this business is as plain as two and two make four. I have got\nthe money, and I should be a born idiot if I parted with it. There is my\npoint of view! Simple enough, isn't it? I don't stand on my dignity; I\ndon't meet you with the law, which is all on my side; I don't blame\nyour coming here, as a total stranger, to try and alter my resolution;\nI don't blame the two girls for wanting to dip their fingers into my\npurse. All I say is, I am not fool enough to open it. _Pas si bete_, as\nwe used to say in the English circle at Zurich. You understand French,\nMiss Garth? _Pas si bete!_\" He set aside his plate of strawberries once\nmore, and daintily dried his fingers on his fine white napkin.\n\nMagdalen kept her temper. If she could have struck him dead by lifting\nher hand at that moment, it is probable she would have lifted it. But\nshe kept her temper.\n\n\"Am I to understand,\" she asked, \"that the last words you have to say in\nthis matter are the words said for you in Mrs. Lecount's letter!\"\n\n\"Precisely so,\" replied Noel Vanstone.\n\n\"You have inherited your own father's fortune, as well as the fortune of\nMr. Andrew Vanstone, and yet you feel no obligation to act from motives\nof justice or generosity toward these two sisters? All you think it\nnecessary to say to them is, you have got the money, and you refuse to\npart with a single farthing of it?\"\n\n\"Most accurately stated! Miss Garth, you are a woman of business.\nLecount, Miss Garth is a woman of business.\"\n\n\"Don't appeal to me, sir,\" cried Mrs. Lecount, gracefully wringing\nher plump white hands. \"I can't bear it! I must interfere! Let me\nsuggest--oh, what do you call it in English?--a compromise. Dear Mr.\nNoel, you are perversely refusing to do yourself justice; you have\nbetter reasons than the reason you have given to Miss Garth. You follow\nyour honored father's example; you feel it due to his memory to act in\nthis matter as he acted before you. That is his reason, Miss Garth---- I\nimplore you on my knees to take that as his reason. He will do what his\ndear father did; no more, no less. His dear father made a proposal, and\nhe himself will now make that proposal over again. Yes, Mr. Noel, you\nwill remember what this poor girl says in her letter to you. Her sister\nhas been obliged to go out as a governess; and she herself, in losing\nher fortune, has lost the hope of her marriage for years and years to\ncome. You will remember this--and you will give the hundred pounds to\none, and the hundred pounds to the other, which your admirable father\noffered in the past time? If he does this, Miss Garth, will he\ndo enough? If he gives a hundred pounds each to these unfortunate\nsisters--?\"\n\n\"He will repent the insult to the last hour of his life,\" said Magdalen.\n\nThe instant that answer passed her lips she would have given worlds\nto recall it. Mrs. Lecount had planted her sting in the right place at\nlast. Those rash words of Magdalen's had burst from her passionately, in\nher own voice.\n\nNothing but the habit of public performance saved her from making the\nserious error that she had committed more palpable still, by attempting\nto set it right. Here her past practice in the Entertainment came to\nher rescue, and urged her to go on instantly in Miss Garth's voice as if\nnothing had happened.\n\n\"You mean well, Mrs. Lecount,\" she continued, \"but you are doing\nharm instead of good. My pupils will accept no such compromise as you\npropose. I am sorry to have spoken violently just now; I beg you will\nexcuse me.\" She looked hard for information in the housekeeper's face\nwhile she spoke those conciliatory words. Mrs. Lecount baffled the\nlook by putting her handkerchief to her eyes. Had she, or had she not,\nnoticed the momentary change in Magdalen's voice from the tones that\nwere assumed to the tones that were natural? Impossible to say.\n\n\"What more can I do!\" murmured Mrs. Lecount behind her handkerchief.\n\"Give me time to think--give me time to recover myself. May I retire,\nsir, for a moment? My nerves are shaken by this sad scene. I must have\na glass of water, or I think I shall faint. Don't go yet, Miss Garth. I\nbeg you will give us time to set this sad matter right, if we can--I beg\nyou will remain until I come back.\"\n\nThere were two doors of entrance to the room. One, the door into the\nfront parlor, close at Magdalen's left hand. The other, the door\ninto the back parlor, situated behind her. Mrs. Lecount politely\nretired--through the open folding-doors--by this latter means of exit,\nso as not to disturb the visitor by passing in front of her. Magdalen\nwaited until she heard the door open and close again behind her, and\nthen resolved to make the most of the opportunity which left her alone\nwith Noel Vanstone. The utter hopelessness of rousing a generous impulse\nin that base nature had now been proved by her own experience. The last\nchance left was to treat him like the craven creature he was, and to\ninfluence him through his fears.\n\nBefore she could speak, Noel Vanstone himself broke the silence.\nCunningly as he strove to hide it, he was half angry, half alarmed at\nhis housekeeper's desertion of him. He looked doubtingly at his visitor;\nhe showed a nervous anxiety to conciliate her until Mrs. Lecount's\nreturn.\n\n\"Pray remember, ma'am, I never denied that this case was a hard one,\" he\nbegan. \"You said just now you had no wish to offend me--and I'm sure I\ndon't want to offend you. May I offer you some strawberries? Would\nyou like to look at my father's bargains? I assure you, ma'am, I am\nnaturally a gallant man; and I feel for both these sisters--especially\nthe younger one. Touch me on the subject of the tender passion, and you\ntouch me on a weak place. Nothing would please me more than to hear that\nMiss Vanstone's lover (I'm sure I always call her Miss Vanstone, and so\ndoes Lecount)--I say, ma'am, nothing would please me more than to hear\nthat Miss Vanstone's lover had come back and married her. If a loan of\nmoney would be likely to bring him back, and if the security offered was\ngood, and if my lawyer thought me justified--\"\n\n\"Stop, Mr. Vanstone,\" said Magdalen. \"You are entirely mistaken in your\nestimate of the person you have to deal with. You are seriously wrong\nin supposing that the marriage of the younger sister--if she could be\nmarried in a week's time--would make any difference in the convictions\nwhich induced her to write to your father and to you. I don't deny that\nshe may act from a mixture of motives. I don't deny that she clings\nto the hope of hastening her marriage, and to the hope of rescuing\nher sister from a life of dependence. But if both those objects were\naccomplished by other means, nothing would induce her to leave you in\npossession of the inheritance which her father meant his children to\nhave. I know her, Mr. Vanstone! She is a nameless, homeless, friendless\nwretch. The law which takes care of you, the law which takes care of\nall legitimate children, casts her like carrion to the winds. It is your\nlaw--not hers. She only knows it as the instrument of a vile oppression,\nan insufferable wrong. The sense of that wrong haunts her like a\npossession of the devil. The resolution to right that wrong burns in her\nlike fire. If that miserable girl was married and rich, with millions\ntomorrow, do you think she would move an inch from her purpose? I tell\nyou she would resist, to the last breath in her body, the vile injustice\nwhich has struck at the helpless children, through the calamity of\ntheir father's death! I tell you she would shrink from no means which a\ndesperate woman can employ to force that closed hand of yours open, or\ndie in the attempt!\"\n\nShe stopped abruptly. Once more her own indomitable earnestness had\nbetrayed her. Once more the inborn nobility of that perverted nature had\nrisen superior to the deception which it had stooped to practice. The\nscheme of the moment vanished from her mind's view; and the resolution\nof her life burst its way outward in her own words, in her own tones,\npouring hotly and more hotly from her heart. She saw the abject manikin\nbefore her cowering, silent, in his chair. Had his fears left him sense\nenough to perceive the change in her voice? No: _his_ face spoke the\ntruth--his fears had bewildered him. This time the chance of the moment\nhad befriended her. The door behind her chair had not opened again\nyet. \"No ears but his have heard me,\" she thought, with a sense of\nunutterable relief. \"I have escaped Mrs. Lecount.\"\n\nShe had done nothing of the kind. Mrs. Lecount had never left the room.\n\nAfter opening the door and closing it again, without going out,\nthe housekeeper had noiselessly knelt down behind Magdalen's chair.\nSteadying herself against the post of the folding-door, she took a pair\nof scissors from her pocket, waited until Noel Vanstone (from whose view\nshe was entirely hidden) had attracted Magdalen's attention by speaking\nto her, and then bent forward, with the scissors ready in her hand. The\nskirt of the false Miss Garth's gown--the brown alpaca dress, with the\nwhite spots on it--touched the floor, within the housekeeper's reach.\nMrs. Lecount lifted the outer of the two flounces which ran round\nthe bottom of the dress one over the other, softly cut away a little\nirregular fragment of stuff from the inner flounce, and neatly smoothed\nthe outer one over it again, so as to hide the gap. By the time she\nhad put the scissors back in her pocket, and had risen to her feet\n(sheltering herself behind the post of the folding-door), Magdalen had\nspoken her last words. Mrs. Lecount quietly repeated the ceremony of\nopening and shutting the back parlor door; and returned to her place.\n\n\"What has happened, sir, in my absence?\" she inquired, addressing her\nmaster with a look of alarm. \"You are pale; you are agitated! Oh, Miss\nGarth, have you forgotten the caution I gave you in the other room?\"\n\n\"Miss Garth has forgotten everything,\" cried Noel Vanstone, recovering\nhis lost composure on the re-appearance of Mrs. Lecount. \"Miss Garth\nhas threatened me in the most outrageous manner. I forbid you to pity\neither of those two girls any more, Lecount--especially the younger\none. She is the most desperate wretch I ever heard of! If she can't get\nmy money by fair means, she threatens to have it by foul. Miss Garth has\ntold me that to my face. To my face!\" he repeated, folding his arms, and\nlooking mortally insulted.\n\n\"Compose yourself, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"Pray compose yourself, and\nleave me to speak to Miss Garth. I regret to hear, ma'am, that you have\nforgotten what I said to you in the next room. You have agitated Mr.\nNoel; you have compromised the interests you came here to plead; and you\nhave only repeated what we knew before. The language you have allowed\nyourself to use in my absence is the same language which your pupil was\nfoolish enough to employ when she wrote for the second time to my late\nmaster. How can a lady of your years and experience seriously repeat\nsuch nonsense? This girl boasts and threatens. She will do this; she\nwill do that. You have her confidence, ma'am. Tell me, if you please, in\nplain words, what can she do?\"\n\nSharply as the taunt was pointed, it glanced off harmless. Mrs.\nLecount had planted her sting once too often. Magdalen rose in complete\npossession of her assumed character and composedly terminated the\ninterview. Ignorant as she was of what had happened behind her chair,\nshe saw a change in Mrs. Lecount's look and manner which warned her to\nrun no more risks, and to trust herself no longer in the house.\n\n\"I am not in my pupil's confidence,\" she said. \"Her own acts will answer\nyour question when the time comes. I can only tell you, from my own\nknowledge of her, that she is no boaster. What she wrote to Mr. Michael\nVanstone was what she was prepared to do---what, I have reason to think,\nshe was actually on the point of doing, when her plans were overthrown\nby his death. Mr. Michael Vanstone's son has only to persist in\nfollowing his father's course to find, before long, that I am not\nmistaken in my pupil, and that I have not come here to intimidate him\nby empty threats. My errand is done. I leave Mr. Noel Vanstone with two\nalternatives to choose from. I leave him to share Mr. Andrew Vanstone's\nfortune with Mr. Andrew Vanstone's daughters--or to persist in his\npresent refusal and face the consequences.\" She bowed, and walked to the\ndoor.\n\nNoel Vanstone started to his feet, with anger and alarm struggling which\nshould express itself first in his blank white face. Before he could\nopen his lips, Mrs. Lecount's plump hands descended on his shoulders,\nput him softly back in his chair, and restored the plate of strawberries\nto its former position on his lap.\n\n\"Refresh yourself, Mr. Noel, with a few more strawberries,\" she said,\n\"and leave Miss Garth to me.\"\n\nShe followed Magdalen into the passage, and closed the door of the room\nafter her.\n\n\"Are you residing in London, ma'am?\" asked Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"No,\" replied Magdalen. \"I reside in the country.\"\n\n\"If I want to write to you, where can I address my letter?\"\n\n\"To the post-office, Birmingham,\" said Magdalen, mentioning the place\nwhich she had last left, and at which all letters were still addressed\nto her.\n\nMrs. Lecount repeated the direction to fix it in her memory, advanced\ntwo steps in the passage, and quietly laid her right hand on Magdalen's\narm.\n\n\"A word of advice, ma'am,\" she said; \"one word at parting. You are a\nbold woman and a clever woman. Don't be too bold; don't be too clever.\nYou are risking more than you think for.\" She suddenly raised herself on\ntiptoe and whispered the next words in Magdalen's ear. \"_I hold you\nin the hollow of my hand!_\" said Mrs. Lecount, with a fierce hissing\nemphasis on every syllable. Her left hand clinched itself stealthily as\nshe spoke. It was the hand in which she had concealed the fragment of\nstuff from Magdalen's gown--the hand which held it fast at that moment.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Magdalen, pushing her back.\n\nMrs. Lecount glided away politely to open the house door.\n\n\"I mean nothing now,\" she said; \"wait a little, and time may show. One\nlast question, ma'am, before I bid you good-by. When your pupil was a\nlittle innocent child, did she ever amuse herself by building a house of\ncards?\"\n\nMagdalen impatiently answered by a gesture in the affirmative.\n\n\"Did you ever see her build up the house higher and higher,\" proceeded\nMrs. Lecount, \"till it was quite a pagoda of cards? Did you ever see her\nopen her little child's eyes wide and look at it, and feel so proud of\nwhat she had done already that she wanted to do more? Did you ever see\nher steady her pretty little hand, and hold her innocent breath, and\nput one other card on the top, and lay the whole house, the instant\nafterward, a heap of ruins on the table? Ah, you have seen that. Give\nher, if you please, a friendly message from me. I venture to say she has\nbuilt the house high enough already; and I recommend her to be careful\nbefore she puts on that other card.\"\n\n\"She shall have your message,\" said Magdalen, with Miss Garth's\nbluntness, and Miss Garth's emphatic nod of the head. \"But I doubt her\nminding it. Her hand is rather steadier than you suppose, and I think\nshe will put on the other card.\"\n\n\"And bring the house down,\" said Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"And build it up again,\" rejoined Magdalen. \"I wish you good-morning.\"\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said Mrs. Lecount, opening the door. \"One last word,\nMiss Garth. Do think of what I said in the back room! Do try the Golden\nOintment for that sad affliction in your eyes!\"\n\nAs Magdalen crossed the threshold of the door she was met by the postman\nascending the house steps with a letter picked out from the bundle\nin his hand. \"Noel Vanstone, Esquire?\" she heard the man say,\ninterrogatively, as she made her way down the front garden to the\nstreet.\n\nShe passed through the garden gates little thinking from what new\ndifficulty and new danger her timely departure had saved her. The letter\nwhich the postman had just delivered into the housekeeper's hands was\nno other than the anonymous letter addressed to Noel Vanstone by Captain\nWragge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nMRS. LECOUNT returned to the parlor, with the fragment of Magdalen's\ndress in one hand, and with Captain Wragge's letter in the other.\n\n\"Have you got rid of her?\" asked Noel Vanstone. \"Have you shut the door\nat last on Miss Garth?\"\n\n\"Don't call her Miss Garth, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, smiling\ncontemptuously. \"She is as much Miss Garth as you are. We have been\nfavored by the performance of a clever masquerade; and if we had taken\nthe disguise off our visitor, I think we should have found under it Miss\nVanstone herself.--Here is a letter for you, sir, which the postman has\njust left.\"\n\nShe put the letter on the table within her master's reach. Noel\nVanstone's amazement at the discovery just communicated to him kept his\nwhole attention concentrated on the housekeeper's face. He never so much\nas looked at the letter when she placed it before him.\n\n\"Take my word for it, sir,\" proceeded Mrs. Lecount, composedly taking a\nchair. \"When our visitor gets home she will put her gray hair away in a\nbox, and will cure that sad affliction in her eyes with warm water and a\nsponge. If she had painted the marks on her face, as well as she painted\nthe inflammation in her eyes, the light would have shown me nothing,\nand I should certainly have been deceived. But I saw the marks; I saw a\nyoung woman's skin under that dirty complexion of hers; I heard in this\nroom a true voice in a passion, as well as a false voice talking with\nan accent, and I don't believe in one morsel of that lady's personal\nappearance from top to toe. The girl herself, in my opinion, Mr.\nNoel--and a bold girl too.\"\n\n\"Why didn't you lock the door and send for the police?\" asked Mr. Noel.\n\"My father would have sent for the police. You know, as well as I do,\nLecount, my father would have sent for the police.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, \"I think your father would have\nwaited until he had got something more for the police to do than we have\ngot for them yet. We shall see this lady again, sir. Perhaps she will\ncome here next time with her own face and her own voice. I am curious to\nsee what her own face is like. I am curious to know whether what I have\nheard of her voice in a passion is enough to make me recognize her voice\nwhen she is calm. I possess a little memorial of her visit of which she\nis not aware, and she will not escape me so easily as she thinks. If it\nturns out a useful memorial, you shall know what it is. If not, I will\nabstain from troubling you on so trifling a subject.--Allow me to remind\nyou, sir, of the letter under your hand. You have not looked at it yet.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone opened the letter. He started as his eye fell on the first\nlines--hesitated--and then hurriedly read it through. The paper dropped\nfrom his hand, and he sank back in his chair. Mrs. Lecount sprang to her\nfeet with the alacrity of a young woman and picked up the letter.\n\n\"What has happened, sir?\" she asked. Her face altered as she put\nthe question, and her large black eyes hardened fiercely, in genuine\nastonishment and alarm.\n\n\"Send for the police,\" exclaimed her master. \"Lecount, I insist on being\nprotected. Send for the police!\"\n\n\"May I read the letter, sir?\"\n\nHe feebly waved his hand. Mrs. Lecount read the letter attentively, and\nput it aside on the table, without a word, when she had done.\n\n\"Have you nothing to say to me?\" asked Noel Vanstone, staring at his\nhousekeeper in blank dismay. \"Lecount, I'm to be robbed! The scoundrel\nwho wrote that letter knows all about it, and won't tell me anything\nunless I pay him. I'm to be robbed! Here's property on this table worth\nthousands of pounds--property that can never be replaced--property that\nall the crowned heads in Europe could not produce if they tried. Lock me\nin, Lecount, and send for the police!\"\n\nInstead of sending for the police, Mrs. Lecount took a large green paper\nfan from the chimney-piece, and seated herself opposite her master.\n\n\"You are agitated, Mr. Noel,\" she said, \"you are heated. Let me cool\nyou.\"\n\nWith her face as hard as ever--with less tenderness of look and\nmanner than most women would have shown if they had been rescuing a\nhalf-drowned fly from a milk-jug--she silently and patiently fanned him\nfor five minutes or more. No practiced eye observing the peculiar bluish\npallor of his complexion, and the marked difficulty with which he drew\nhis breath, could have failed to perceive that the great organ of life\nwas in this man, what the housekeeper had stated it to be, too weak for\nthe function which it was called on to perform. The heart labored over\nits work as if it had been the heart of a worn-out old man.\n\n\"Are you relieved, sir?\" asked Mrs. Lecount. \"Can you think a little?\nCan you exercise your better judgment?\"\n\nShe rose and put her hand over his heart with as much mechanical\nattention and as little genuine interest as if she had been feeling the\nplates at dinner to ascertain if they had been properly warmed. \"Yes,\"\nshe went on, seating herself again, and resuming the exercise of the\nfan; \"you are getting better already, Mr. Noel.--Don't ask me about this\nanonymous letter until you have thought for yourself, and have given\nyour own opinion first.\" She went on with the fanning, and looked him\nhard in the face all the time. \"Think,\" she said; \"think, sir, without\ntroubling yourself to express your thoughts. Trust to my intimate\nsympathy with you to read them. Yes, Mr. Noel, this letter is a paltry\nattempt to frighten you. What does it say? It says you are the object of\na conspiracy directed by Miss Vanstone. We know that already--the lady\nof the inflamed eyes has told us. We snap our fingers at the conspiracy.\nWhat does the letter say next? It says the writer has valuable\ninformation to give you if you will pay for it. What did you call this\nperson yourself just now, sir?\"\n\n\"I called him a scoundrel,\" said Noel Vanstone, recovering his\nself-importance, and raising himself gradually in his chair.\n\n\"I agree with you in that, sir, as I agree in everything else,\"\nproceeded Mrs. Lecount. \"He is a scoundrel who really has this\ninformation and who means what he says, or he is a mouthpiece of Miss\nVanstone's, and she has caused this letter to be written for the purpose\nof puzzling us by another form of disguise. Whether the letter is true,\nor whether the letter is false--am I not reading your own wiser thoughts\nnow, Mr. Noel?--you know better than to put your enemies on their guard\nby employing the police in this matter too soon. I quite agree with\nyou--no police just yet. You will allow this anonymous man, or anonymous\nwoman, to suppose you are easily frightened; you will lay a trap for the\ninformation in return for the trap laid for your money; you will answer\nthe letter, and see what comes of the answer; and you will only pay the\nexpense of employing the police when you know the expense is necessary.\nI agree with you again--no expense, if we can help it. In every\nparticular, Mr. Noel, my mind and your mind in this matter are one.\"\n\n\"It strikes you in that light, Lecount--does it?\" said Noel Vanstone. \"I\nthink so myself; I certainly think so. I won't pay the police a farthing\nif I can possibly help it.\" He took up the letter again, and became\nfretfully perplexed over a second reading of it. \"But the man wants\nmoney!\" he broke out, impatiently. \"You seem to forget, Lecount, that\nthe man wants money.\"\n\n\"Money which you offer him, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Lecount; \"but--as your\nthoughts have already anticipated--money which you don't give him. No!\nno! you say to this man: 'Hold out your hand, sir;' and when he has held\nit, you give him a smack for his pains, and put your own hand back in\nyour pocket.--I am so glad to see you laughing, Mr. Noel! so glad to\nsee you getting back your good spirits. We will answer the letter by\nadvertisement, as the writer directs--advertisement is so cheap! Your\npoor hand is trembling a little--shall I hold the pen for you? I am not\nfit to do more; but I can always promise to hold the pen.\"\n\nWithout waiting for his reply she went into the back parlor, and\nreturned with pen, ink, and paper. Arranging a blotting-book on her\nknees, and looking a model of cheerful submission, she placed herself\nonce more in front of her master's chair.\n\n\"Shall I write from your dictation, sir?\" she inquired. \"Or shall I make\na little sketch, and will you correct it afterward? I will make a little\nsketch. Let me see the letter. We are to advertise in the _Times_, and\nwe are to address 'An Unknown Friend.' What shall I say, Mr. Noel? Stay;\nI will write it, and then you can see for yourself: 'An Unknown Friend\nis requested to mention (by advertisement) an address at which a letter\ncan reach him. The receipt of the information which he offers will be\nacknowledged by a reward of--' What sum of money do you wish me to set\ndown, sir?\"\n\n\"Set down nothing,\" said Noel Vanstone, with a sudden outbreak of\nimpatience. \"Money matters are my business--I say money matters are my\nbusiness, Lecount. Leave it to me.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir,\" replied Mrs. Lecount, handing her master the\nblotting-book. \"You will not forget to be liberal in offering money when\nyou know beforehand you don't mean to part with it?\"\n\n\"Don't dictate, Lecount! I won't submit to dictation!\" said Noel\nVanstone, asserting his own independence more and more impatiently. \"I\nmean to conduct this business for myself. I am master, Lecount!\"\n\n\"You are master, sir.\"\n\n\"My father was master before me. And I am my father's son. I tell you,\nLecount, I am my father's son!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount bowed submissively.\n\n\"I mean to set down any sum of money I think right,\" pursued Noel\nVanstone, nodding his little flaxen head vehemently. \"I mean to send\nthis advertisement myself. The servant shall take it to the stationer's\nto be put into the _Times_. When I ring the bell twice, send the\nservant. You understand, Lecount? Send the servant.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount bowed again and walked slowly to the door. She knew to a\nnicety when to lead her master and when to let him go alone. Experience\nhad taught her to govern him in all essential points by giving way to\nhim afterward on all points of minor detail. It was a characteristic\nof his weak nature--as it is of all weak natures--to assert\nitself obstinately on trifles. The filling in of the blank in the\nadvertisement was the trifle in this case; and Mrs. Lecount quieted her\nmaster's suspicions that she was leading him by instantly conceding it.\n\"My mule has kicked,\" she thought to herself, in her own language, as\nshe opened the door. \"I can do no more with him to-day.\"\n\n\"Lecount!\" cried her master, as she stepped into the passage. \"Come\nback.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount came back.\n\n\"You're not offended with me, are you?\" asked Noel Vanstone, uneasily.\n\n\"Certainly not, sir,\" replied Mrs. Lecount. \"As you said just now--you\nare master.\"\n\n\"Good creature! Give me your hand.\" He kissed her hand, and smiled in\nhigh approval of his own affectionate proceeding. \"Lecount, you are a\nworthy creature!\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. She courtesied and went out. \"If he\nhad any brains in that monkey head of his,\" she said to herself in the\npassage, \"what a rascal he would be!\"\n\nLeft by himself, Noel Vanstone became absorbed in anxious reflection\nover the blank space in the advertisement. Mrs. Lecount's apparently\nsuperfluous hint to him to be liberal in offering money when he knew\nhe had no intention of parting with it, had been founded on an intimate\nknowledge of his character. He had inherited his father's sordid love of\nmoney, without inheriting his father's hard-headed capacity for seeing\nthe uses to which money can be put. His one idea in connection with his\nwealth was the idea of keeping it. He was such an inborn miser that the\nbare prospect of being liberal in theory only daunted him. He took up\nthe pen; laid it down again; and read the anonymous letter for the third\ntime, shaking his head over it suspiciously. \"If I offer this man a\nlarge sum of money,\" he thought, on a sudden, \"how do I know he may not\nfind a means of actually making me pay it? Women are always in a hurry.\nLecount is always in a hurry. I have got the afternoon before me--I'll\ntake the afternoon to consider it.\"\n\nHe fretfully put away the blotting-book and the sketch of the\nadvertisement on the chair which Mrs. Lecount had just left. As he\nreturned to his own seat, he shook his little head solemnly, and\narranged his white dressing-gown over his knees with the air of a\nman absorbed in anxious thought. Minute after minute passed away; the\nquarters and the half-hours succeeded each other on the dial of Mrs.\nLecount's watch, and still Noel Vanstone remained lost in doubt; still\nno summons for the servants disturbed the tranquillity of the parlor\nbell.\n\n* * * * *\n\nMeanwhile, after parting with Mrs. Lecount, Magdalen had cautiously\nabstained from crossing the road to her lodgings, and had only ventured\nto return after making a circuit in the neighborhood. When she found\nherself once more in Vauxhall Walk, the first object which attracted\nher attention was a cab drawn up before the door of the lodgings. A few\nsteps more in advance showed her the landlady's daughter standing at\nthe cab door engaged in a dispute with the driver on the subject of\nhis fare. Noticing that the girl's back was turned toward her, Magdalen\ninstantly profited by that circumstance and slipped unobserved into the\nhouse.\n\nShe glided along the passage, ascended the stairs, and found herself,\non the first landing, face to face with her traveling companion! There\nstood Mrs. Wragge, with a pile of small parcels hugged up in her arms,\nanxiously waiting the issue of the dispute with the cabman in the\nstreet. To return was impossible--the sound of the angry voices below\nwas advancing into the passage. To hesitate was worse than useless. But\none choice was left--the choice of going on--and Magdalen desperately\ntook it. She pushed by Mrs. Wragge without a word, ran into her own\nroom, tore off her cloak, bonnet and wig, and threw them down out of\nsight in the blank space between the sofa-bedstead and the wall.\n\nFor the first few moments, astonishment bereft Mrs. Wragge of the power\nof speech, and rooted her to the spot where she stood. Two out of the\ncollection of parcels in her arms fell from them on the stairs. The\nsight of that catastrophe roused her. \"Thieves!\" cried Mrs. Wragge,\nsuddenly struck by an idea. \"Thieves!\"\n\nMagdalen heard her through the room door, which she had not had time to\nclose completely. \"Is that you, Mrs. Wragge?\" she called out in her own\nvoice. \"What is the matter?\" She snatched up a towel while she spoke,\ndipped it in water, and passed it rapidly over the lower part of\nher face. At the sound of the familiar voice Mrs. Wragge turned\nround--dropped a third parcel--and, forgetting it in her astonishment,\nascended the second flight of stairs. Magdalen stepped out on the\nfirst-floor landing, with the towel held over her forehead as if she\nwas suffering from headache. Her false eyebrows required time for their\nremoval, and a headache assumed for the occasion suggested the most\nconvenient pretext she could devise for hiding them as they were hidden\nnow.\n\n\"What are you disturbing the house for?\" she asked. \"Pray be quiet; I am\nhalf blind with the headache.\"\n\n\"Anything wrong, ma'am?\" inquired the landlady from the passage.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" replied Magdalen. \"My friend is timid; and the\ndispute with the cabman has frightened her. Pay the man what he wants,\nand let him go.\"\n\n\"Where is She?\" asked Mrs. Wragge, in a tremulous whisper. \"Where's the\nwoman who scuttled by me into your room?\"\n\n\"Pooh!\" said Magdalen. \"No woman scuttled by you--as you call it. Look\nin and see for yourself.\"\n\nShe threw open the door. Mrs. Wragge walked into the room--looked all\nover it--saw nobody--and indicated her astonishment at the result by\ndropping a fourth parcel, and trembling helplessly from head to foot.\n\n\"I saw her go in here,\" said Mrs. Wragge, in awestruck accents. \"A woman\nin a gray cloak and a poke bonnet. A rude woman. She scuttled by me\non the stairs--she did. Here's the room, and no woman in it. Give us a\nPrayer-book!\" cried Mrs. Wragge, turning deadly pale, and letting her\nwhole remaining collection of parcels fall about her in a little cascade\nof commodities. \"I want to read something Good. I want to think of my\nlatter end. I've seen a Ghost!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" said Magdalen. \"You're dreaming; the shopping has been too\nmuch for you. Go into your own room and take your bonnet off.\"\n\n\"I've heard tell of ghosts in night-gowns, ghosts in sheets, and ghosts\nin chains,\" proceeded Mrs. Wragge, standing petrified in her own magic\ncircle of linen-drapers' parcels. \"Here's a worse ghost than any of\n'em--a ghost in a gray cloak and a poke bonnet. I know what it is,\"\ncontinued Mrs. Wragge, melting into penitent tears. \"It's a judgment on\nme for being so happy away from the captain. It's a judgment on me for\nhaving been down at heel in half the shops in London, first with one\nshoe and then with the other, all the time I've been out. I'm a sinful\ncreature. Don't let go of me--whatever you do, my dear, don't let go of\nme!\" She caught Magdalen fast by the arm and fell into another trembling\nfit at the bare idea of being left by herself.\n\nThe one remaining chance in such an emergency as this was to submit to\ncircumstances. Magdalen took Mrs. Wragge to a chair; having first\nplaced it in such a position as might enable her to turn her back on her\ntraveling-companion, while she removed the false eyebrows by the help\nof a little water. \"Wait a minute there,\" she said, \"and try if you can\ncompose yourself while I bathe my head.\"\n\n\"Compose myself?\" repeated Mrs. Wragge. \"How am I to compose myself when\nmy head feels off my shoulders? The worst Buzzing I ever had with the\nCookery-book was nothing to the Buzzing I've got now with the Ghost.\nHere's a miserable end to a holiday! You may take me back again, my\ndear, whenever you like--I've had enough of it already!\"\n\nHaving at last succeeded in removing the eyebrows, Magdalen was free to\ncombat the unfortunate impression produced on her companion's mind by\nevery weapon of persuasion which her ingenuity could employ.\n\nThe attempt proved useless. Mrs. Wragge persisted--on evidence which,\nit may be remarked in parenthesis, would have satisfied many wiser\nghost-seers than herself--in believing that she had been supernaturally\nfavored by a visitor from the world of spirits. All that Magdalen could\ndo was to ascertain, by cautious investigation, that Mrs. Wragge had not\nbeen quick enough to identify the supposed ghost with the character\nof the old North-country lady in the Entertainment. Having satisfied\nherself on this point, she had no resource but to leave the rest to the\nnatural incapability of retaining impressions--unless those impressions\nwere perpetually renewed--which was one of the characteristic\ninfirmities of her companion's weak mind. After fortifying Mrs. Wragge\nby reiterated assurances that one appearance (according to all the\nlaws and regulations of ghosts) meant nothing unless it was immediately\nfollowed by two more--after patiently leading back her attention to the\nparcels dropped on the floor and on the stairs--and after promising to\nkeep the door of communication ajar between the two rooms if Mrs. Wragge\nwould engage on her side to retire to her own chamber, and to say no\nmore on the terrible subject of the ghost--Magdalen at last secured the\nprivilege of reflecting uninterruptedly on the events of that memorable\nday.\n\nTwo serious consequences had followed her first step forward. Mrs.\nLecount had entrapped her into speaking in her own voice, and accident\nhad confronted her with Mrs. Wragge in disguise.\n\nWhat advantage had she gained to set against these disasters? The\nadvantage of knowing more of Noel Vanstone and of Mrs. Lecount than she\nmight have discovered in months if she had trusted to inquiries made for\nher by others. One uncertainty which had hitherto perplexed her was set\nat rest already. The scheme she had privately devised against Michael\nVanstone--which Captain Wragge's sharp insight had partially penetrated\nwhen she first warned him that their partnership must be dissolved--was\na scheme which she could now plainly see must be abandoned as\nhopeless, in the case of Michael Vanstone's son. The father's habits\nof speculation had been the pivot on which the whole machinery of\nher meditated conspiracy had been constructed to turn. No such\nvantage-ground was discoverable in the doubly sordid character of\nthe son. Noel Vanstone was invulnerable on the very point which had\npresented itself in his father as open to attack.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, how was she to shape her future course?\nWhat new means could she discover which would lead her secretly to\nher end, in defiance of Mrs. Lecount's malicious vigilance and Noel\nVanstone's miserly distrust?\n\nShe was seated before the looking-glass, mechanically combing out her\nhair, while that all-important consideration occupied her mind. The\nagitation of the moment had raised a feverish color in her cheeks, and\nhad brightened the light in her large gray eyes. She was conscious of\nlooking her best; conscious how her beauty gained by contrast, after the\nremoval of the disguise. Her lovely light brown hair looked thicker and\nsofter than ever, now that it had escaped from its imprisonment under\nthe gray wig. She twisted it this way and that, with quick, dexterous\nfingers; she laid it in masses on her shoulders; she threw it back from\nthem in a heap and turned sidewise to see how it fell--to see her back\nand shoulders freed from the artificial deformities of the padded cloak.\nAfter a moment she faced the looking-glass once more; plunged both hands\ndeep in her hair; and, resting her elbows on the table, looked closer\nand closer at the reflection of herself, until her breath began to dim\nthe glass. \"I can twist any man alive round my finger,\" she thought,\nwith a smile of superb triumph, \"as long as I keep my looks! If that\ncontemptible wretch saw me now--\" She shrank from following that thought\nto its end, with a sudden horror of herself: she drew back from the\nglass, shuddering, and put her hands over her face. \"Oh, Frank!\" she\nmurmured, \"but for you, what a wretch I might be!\" Her eager fingers\nsnatched the little white silk bag from its hiding-place in her bosom;\nher lips devoured it with silent kisses. \"My darling! my angel! Oh,\nFrank, how I love you!\" The tears gushed into her eyes. She passionately\ndried them, restored the bag to its place, and turned her back on the\nlooking-glass. \"No more of myself,\" she thought; \"no more of my mad,\nmiserable self for to-day!\"\n\nShrinking from all further contemplation of her next step in\nadvance--shrinking from the fast-darkening future, with which Noel\nVanstone was now associated in her inmost thoughts--she looked\nimpatiently about the room for some homely occupation which might take\nher out of herself. The disguise which she had flung down between the\nwall and the bed recurred to her memory. It was impossible to leave it\nthere. Mrs. Wragge (now occupied in sorting her parcels) might weary\nof her employment, might come in again at a moment's notice, might pass\nnear the bed, and see the gray cloak. What was to be done?\n\nHer first thought was to put the disguise back in her trunk. But after\nwhat had happened, there was danger in trusting it so near to herself\nwhile she and Mrs. Wragge were together under the same roof. She\nresolved to be rid of it that evening, and boldly determined on sending\nit back to Birmingham. Her bonnet-box fitted into her trunk. She took\nthe box out, thrust in the wig and cloak, and remorselessly flattened\ndown the bonnet at the top. The gown (which she had not yet taken off)\nwas her own; Mrs. Wragge had been accustomed to see her in it--there\nwas no need to send the gown back. Before closing the box, she hastily\ntraced these lines on a sheet of paper: \"I took the inclosed things away\nby mistake. Please keep them for me, with the rest of my luggage in your\npossession, until you hear from me again.\" Putting the paper on the top\nof the bonnet, she directed the box to Captain Wragge at Birmingham,\ntook it downstairs immediately, and sent the landlady's daughter away\nwith it to the nearest Receiving-house. \"That difficulty is disposed\nof,\" she thought, as she went back to her own room again.\n\nMrs. Wragge was still occupied in sorting her parcels on her narrow\nlittle bed. She turned round with a faint scream when Magdalen looked\nin at her. \"I thought it was the ghost again,\" said Mrs. Wragge. \"I'm\ntrying to take warning, my dear, by what's happened to me. I've put all\nmy parcels straight, just as the captain would like to see 'em. I'm\nup at heel with both shoes. If I close my eyes to-night--which I don't\nthink I shall--I'll go to sleep as straight as my legs will let me. And\nI'll never have another holiday as long as I live. I hope I shall be\nforgiven,\" said Mrs. Wragge, mournfully shaking her head. \"I humbly hope\nI shall be forgiven.\"\n\n\"Forgiven!\" repeated Magdalen. \"If other women wanted as little\nforgiving as you do--Well! well! Suppose you open some of these parcels.\nCome! I want to see what you have been buying to-day.\"\n\nMrs. Wragge hesitated, sighed penitently, considered a little,\nstretched out her hand timidly toward one of the parcels, thought of\nthe supernatural warning, and shrank back from her own purchases with a\ndesperate exertion of self-control.\n\n\"Open this one.\" said Magdalen, to encourage her: \"what is it?\"\n\nMrs. Wragge's faded blue eyes began to brighten dimly, in spite of her\nremorse; but she self-denyingly shook her head. The master-passion of\nshopping might claim his own again--but the ghost was not laid yet.\n\n\"Did you get it at a bargain?\" asked Magdalen, confidentially.\n\n\"Dirt cheap!\" cried poor Mrs. Wragge, falling headlong into the snare,\nand darting at the parcel as eagerly as if nothing had happened.\n\nMagdalen kept her gossiping over her purchases for an hour or more,\nand then wisely determined to distract her attention from all ghostly\nrecollections in another way by taking her out for a walk.\n\nAs they left the lodgings, the door of Noel Vanstone's house opened, and\nthe woman-servant appeared, bent on another errand. She was apparently\ncharged with a letter on this occasion which she carried carefully in\nher hand. Conscious of having formed no plan yet either for attack or\ndefense, Magdalen wondered, with a momentary dread, whether Mrs. Lecount\nhad decided already on opening fresh communications, and whether the\nletter was directed to \"Miss Garth.\"\n\nThe let ter bore no such address. Noel Vanstone had solved his pecuniary\nproblem at last. The blank space in the advertisement was filled up, and\nMrs. Lecount's acknowledgment of the captain's anonymous warning was now\non its way to insertion in the _Times_.\n\nTHE END OF THE THIRD SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\n\nI.\n\n_Extract from the Advertising Columns of \"The Times.\"_\n\n\"AN UNKNOWN FRIEND is requested to mention (by advertisement) an address\nat which a letter can reach him.

Consider it under my\nspecial protection until I hear from you again.\n\n\"I embrace this opportunity to assure you once more of my unalterable\nfidelity to your interests. Without attempting to intrude myself into\nyour confidence, may I inquire whether Mr. Noel Vanstone has consented\nto do you justice? I greatly fear he has declined--in which case I can\nlay my hand on my heart, and solemnly declare that his meanness revolts\nme. Why do I feel a foreboding that you have appealed to him in vain?\nWhy do I find myself viewing this fellow in the light of a noxious\ninsect? We are total strangers to each other; I have no sort of\nknowledge of him, except the knowledge I picked up in making your\ninquiries. Has my intense sympathy with your interests made my\nperceptions prophetic? or, to put it fancifully, is there really such a\nthing as a former state of existence? and has Mr. Noel Vanstone mortally\ninsulted me--say, in some other planet?\n\n\"I write, my dear Magdalen, as you see, with my customary dash of humor.\nBut I am serious in placing my services at your disposal. Don't let the\nquestion of terms cause you an instant's hesitation. I accept beforehand\nany terms you like to mention. If your present plans point that way, I\nam ready to squeeze Mr. Noel Vanstone, in your interests, till the gold\noozes out of him at every pore. Pardon the coarseness of this metaphor.\nMy anxiety to be of service to you rushes into words; lays my meaning,\nin the rough, at your feet; and leaves your taste to polish it with the\nchoicest ornaments of the English language.\n\n\"How is my unfortunate wife? I am afraid you find it quite impossible\nto keep her up at heel, or to mold her personal appearance into harmony\nwith the eternal laws of symmetry and order. Does she attempt to be too\nfamiliar with you? I have always been accustomed to check her, in this\nrespect. She has never been permitted to call me anything but Captain;\nand on the rare occasions since our union, when circumstances may have\nobliged her to address me by letter, her opening form of salutation has\nbeen rigidly restricted to 'Dear Sir.' Accept these trifling domestic\nparticulars as suggesting hints which may be useful to you in managing\nMrs. Wragge; and believe me, in anxious expectation of hearing from you\nagain,\n\n\"Devotedly yours,\n\n\"HORATIO WRAGGE.\"\n\n\nIII.\n\n_From Norah to Magdalen_.\n\n_[Forwarded, with the Two Letters that follow it, from the Post-office,\nBirmingham.]_\n\n\"Westmoreland House, Kensington, July 1st.\n\n\"MY DEAREST MAGDALEN--When you write next (and pray write soon!) address\nyour letter to me at Miss Garth's. I have left my situation; and some\nlittle time may elapse before I find another.\n\n\"Now it is all over I may acknowledge to you, my darling, that I was not\nhappy. I tried hard to win the affection of the two little girls I had\nto teach; but they seemed, I am sure I can't tell why, to dislike me\nfrom the first. Their mother I have no reason to complain of. But their\ngrandmother, who was really the ruling power in the house, made my life\nvery hard to me. My inexperience in teaching was a constant subject\nof remark with her; and my difficulties with the children were always\nvisited on me as if they had been entirely of my own making. I tell you\nthis, so that you may not suppose I regret having left my situation. Far\nfrom it, my love--I am glad to be out of the house.\n\n\"I have saved a little money, Magdalen; and I should so like to spend it\nin staying a few days with you. My heart aches for a sight of my sister;\nmy ears are weary for the sound of her voice. A word from you telling me\nwhere we can meet, is all I want. Think of it--pray think of it.\n\n\"Don't suppose I am discouraged by this first check. There are many kind\npeople in the world; and some of them may employ me next time. The way\nto happiness is often very hard to find; harder, I almost think, for\nwomen than for men. But if we only try patiently, and try long enough,\nwe reach it at last--in heaven, if not on earth. I think _my_ way now is\nthe way which leads to seeing you again. Don't forget that, my love, the\nnext time you think of\n\n\"NORAH.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\n_From Miss Garth to Magdalen._\n\n\"Westmoreland House, July 1st.\n\n\"MY DEAR MAGDALEN--You have no useless remonstrances to apprehend at the\nsight of my handwriting. My only object in this letter is to tell you\nsomething which I know your sister will not tell you of her own\naccord. She is entirely ignorant that I am writing to you. Keep her\nin ignorance, if you wish to spare her unnecessary anxiety, and me\nunnecessary distress.\n\n\"Norah's letter, no doubt, tells you that she has left her situation. I\nfeel it my painful duty to add that she has left it on your account.\n\n\"The matter occurred in this manner. Messrs. Wyatt, Pendril, and Gwilt\nare the solicitors of the gentleman in whose family Norah was employed.\nThe life which you have chosen for yourself was known as long ago as\nDecember last to all the partners. You were discovered performing in\npublic at Derby by the person who had been employed to trace you at\nYork; and that discovery was communicated by Mr. Wyatt to Norah's\nemployer a few days since, in reply to direct inquiries about you on\nthat gentleman's part. His wife and his mother (who lives with him)\nhad expressly desired that he would make those inquiries; their doubts\nhaving been aroused by Norah's evasive answers when they questioned her\nabout her sister. You know Norah too well to blame her for this. Evasion\nwas the only escape your present life had left her, from telling a\ndownright falsehood.\n\n\"That same day, the two ladies of the family, the elder and the younger,\nsent for your sister, and told her they had discovered that you were a\npublic performer, roaming from place to place in the country under an\nassumed name. They were just enough not to blame Norah for this;\nthey were just enough to acknowledge that her conduct had been as\nirreproachable as I had guaranteed it should be when I got her the\nsituation. But, at the same time, they made it a positive condition of\nher continuing in their employment that she should never permit you to\nvisit her at their house, or to meet her and walk out with her when she\nwas in attendance on the children. Your sister--who has patiently borne\nall hardships that fell on herself--instantly resented the slur cast on\n_you_. She gave her employers warning on the spot. High words followed,\nand she left the house that evening.\n\n\"I have no wish to distress you by representing the loss of this\nsituation in the light of a disaster. Norah was not so happy in it as\nI had hoped and believed she would be. It was impossible for me to know\nbeforehand that the children were sullen and intractable, or that the\nhusband's mother was accustomed to make her domineering disposition felt\nby every one in the house. I will readily admit that Norah is well out\nof this situation. But the harm does not stop here. For all you and\nI know to the contrary, the harm may go on. What has happened in this\nsituation may happen in another. Your way of life, however pure your\nconduct may be--and I will do you the justice to believe it pure--is\na suspicious way of life to all respectable people. I have lived long\nenough in this world to know that the sense of Propriety, in nine\nEnglishwomen out of ten, makes no allowances and feels no pity. Norah's\nnext employers may discover you; and Norah may throw up a situation next\ntime which we may never be able to find for her again.\n\n\"I leave you to consider this. My child, don't think I am hard on you. I\nam jealous for your sister's tranquillity. If you will forget the past,\nMagdalen, and come back, trust to your old governess to forget it too,\nand to give you the home which your father and mother once gave her.\nYour friend, my dear, always,\n\n\"HARRIET GARTH.\"\n\n\nV.\n\n_From Francis Clare, Jun., to Magdalen._\n\n\"Shanghai, China, April 23d, 1847.\n\n\"MY DEAR MAGDALEN--I have deferred answering your letter, in consequence\nof the distracted state of my mind, which made me unfit to write to you.\nI am still unfit, but I feel I ought to delay no longer. My sense of\nhonor fortifies me, and I undergo the pain of writing this letter.\n\n\"My prospects in China are all at an end. The Firm to which I was\nbrutally consigned, as if I was a bale of merchandise, has worn out my\npatience by a series of petty insults; and I have felt compelled, from\nmotives of self-respect, to withdraw my services, which were undervalued\nfrom the first. My returning to England under these circumstances is out\nof the question. I have been too cruelly used in my own country to\nwish to go back to it, even if I could. I propose embarking on board a\nprivate trading-vessel in these seas in a mercantile capacity, to make\nmy way, if I can, for myself. How it will end, or what will happen to me\nnext, is more than I can say. It matters little what becomes of me. I\nam a wanderer and an exile, entirely through the fault of others. The\nunfeeling desire at home to get rid of me has accomplished its object. I\nam got rid of for good.\n\n\"There is only one more sacrifice left for me to make--the sacrifice of\nmy heart's dearest feelings. With no prospects before me, with no chance\nof coming home, what hope can I feel of performing my engagement to\nyourself? None! A more selfish man than I am might hold you to that\nengagement; a less considerate man than I am might keep you waiting for\nyears--and to no purpose after all. Cruelly as they have been trampled\non, my feelings are too sensitive to allow me to do this. I write it\nwith the tears in my eyes--you shall not link your fate to an outcast.\nAccept these heart-broken lines as releasing you from your promise. Our\nengagement is at an end.\n\n\"The one consolation which supports me in bidding you farewell is, that\nneither of us is to blame. You may have acted weakly, under my father's\ninfluence, but I am sure you acted for the best. Nobody knew what the\nfatal consequences of driving me out of England would be but myself--and\nI was not listened to. I yielded to my father, I yielded to you; and\nthis is the end of it!\n\n\"I am suffering too acutely to write more. May you never know what my\nwithdrawal from our engagement has cost me! I beg you will not\nblame yourself. It is not your fault that I have had all my energies\nmisdirected by others--it is not your fault that I have never had a fair\nchance of getting on in life. Forget the deserted wretch who breathes\nhis heartfelt prayers for your happiness, and who will ever remain your\nfriend and well-wisher.\n\n\"FRANCIS CLARE, Jun.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\n_From Francis Clare, Sen., to Magdalen_.\n\n_[Inclosing the preceding Letter.]_\n\n\"I always told your poor father my son was a Fool, but I never knew he\nwas a Scoundrel until the mail came in from China. I have every reason\nto believe that he has left his employers under the most disgraceful\ncircumstances. Forget him from this time forth, as I do. When you and\nI last set eyes on each other, you behaved well to me in this business.\nAll I can now say in return, I do say. My girl, I am sorry for you,\n\n\"F.

She\nsits, as I am informed, perfectly silent, and perfectly unconscious of\nwhat goes on about her, for hours together, with a letter in her\nhand which she will allow nobody to take from her. If this state of\ndepression continues, very distressing mental consequences may follow;\nand I only do my duty in suggesting that some relative or friend should\ninterfere who has influence enough to rouse her.

I have just heard from old\nMr. Clare. Oh, Magdalen, if you have no pity on yourself, have some\npity on me! The thought of you alone among strangers, the thought of you\nheart-broken under this dreadful blow, never leaves me for an instant.\nNo words can tell how I feel for you! My own love, remember the better\ndays at home before that cowardly villain stole his way into your heart;\nremember the happy time at Combe-Raven when we were always together.\nOh, don't, don't treat me like a stranger! We are alone in the world\nnow--let me come and comfort you, let me be more than a sister to you,\nif I can. One line--only one line to tell me where I can find you!\"\n\n\nIX.\n\n_From Magdalen to Norah._\n\n\"July 7th.\n\n\"MY DEAREST NORAH--All that your love for me can wish your letter has\ndone. You, and you alone, have found your way to my heart. I could think\nagain, I could feel again, after reading what you have written to me.\nLet this assurance quiet your anxieties. My mind lives and breathes once\nmore--it was dead until I got your letter.\n\n\"The shock I have suffered has left a strange quietness in me. I feel as\nif I had parted from my former self--as if the hopes once so dear to me\nhad all gone back to some past time from which I am now far removed. I\ncan look at the wreck of my life more calmly, Norah, than you could\nlook at it if we were both together again. I can trust myself already to\nwrite to Frank.\n\n\"My darling, I think no woman ever knows how utterly she has given\nherself up to the man she loves--until that man has ill-treated her. Can\nyou pity my weakness if I confess to having felt a pang at my heart\nwhen I read that part of your letter which calls Frank a coward and a\nvillain? Nobody can despise me for this as I despise myself. I am like a\ndog who crawls back and licks the master's hand that has beaten him. But\nit is so--I would confess it to nobody but you--indeed, indeed it is\nso. He has deceived and deserted me; he has written me a cruel farewell\n--but don't call him a villain! If he repented and came back to me, I\nwould die rather than marry him now--but it grates on me to see that\nword coward written against him in your hand! If he is weak of purpose,\nwho tried his weakness beyond what it could bear? Do you think this\nwould have happened if Michael Vanstone had not robbed us of our own,\nand forced Frank away from me to China? In a week from to-day the year\nof waiting would have come to an end, and I should have been Frank's\nwife, if my marriage portion had not been taken from me.\n\n\"You will say, after what has hap pened, it is well that I have escaped.\nMy love! there is something perverse in my heart which answers, No!\nBetter have been Frank's wretched wife than the free woman I am now.\n\n\"I have not written to him. He sends me no address at which I could\nwrite, even if I would. But I have not the wish. I will wait before\nI send him _my_ farewell. If a day ever comes when I have the fortune\nwhich my father once promised I should bring to him, do you know what I\nwould do with it? I would send it all to Frank, as my revenge on him\nfor his letter; as the last farewell word on my side to the man who has\ndeserted me. Let me live for that day! Let me live, Norah, in the hope\nof better times for _you_, which is all the hope I have left. When I\nthink of your hard life, I can almost feel the tears once more in my\nweary eyes. I can almost think I have come back again to my former self.\n\n\"You will not think me hard-hearted and ungrateful if I say that we must\nwait a little yet before we meet. I want to be more fit to see you than\nI am now. I want to put Frank further away from me, and to bring you\nnearer still. Are these good reasons? I don't know--don't ask me for\nreasons. Take the kiss I have put for you here, where the little circle\nis drawn on the paper; and let that bring us together for the present\ntill I write again. Good-by, my love. My heart is true to you, Norah,\nbut I dare not see you yet.\n\n\"MAGDALEN.\"\n\n\nX.\n\n_From Magdalen to Miss Garth._\n\n\"MY DEAR MISS GARTH--I have been long in answering your letter; but you\nknow what has happened, and you will forgive me.\n\n\"All that I have to say may be said in a few words. You may depend on my\nnever making the general Sense of Propriety my enemy again: I am getting\nknowledge enough of the world to make it my accomplice next time. Norah\nwill never leave another situation on my account--my life as a public\nperformer is at an end. It was harmless enough, God knows--I may live,\nand so may you, to mourn the day when I parted from it--but I shall\nnever return to it again. It has left me, as Frank has left me, as all\nmy better thoughts have left me except my thoughts of Norah.\n\n\"Enough of myself! Shall I tell you some news to brighten this dull\nletter? Mr. Michael Vanstone is dead, and Mr. Noel Vanstone has\nsucceeded to the possession of my fortune and Norah's. He is quite\nworthy of his inheritance. In his father's place, he would have ruined\nus as his father did.\n\n\"I have no more to say that you would care to know. Don't be distressed\nabout me. I am trying to recover my spirits--I am trying to forget the\npoor deluded girl who was foolish enough to be fond of Frank in the\nold days at Combe-Raven. Sometimes a pang comes which tells me the girl\nwon't be forgotten--but not often.\n\n\"It was very kind of you, when you wrote to such a lost creature as I\nam, to sign yourself--_always my friend._ 'Always' is a bold word, my\ndear old governess! I wonder whether you will ever want to recall it? It\nwill make no difference if you do, in the gratitude I shall always feel\nfor the trouble you took with me when I was a little girl. I have ill\nrepaid that trouble--ill repaid your kindness to me in after life. I ask\nyour pardon and your pity. The best thing you can do for both of us is\nto forget me. Affectionately yours,\n\n\"MAGDALEN.\"\n\n\"P.S.--I open the envelope to add one line.

My mind is settled at last, and I am now able to accept the\nservices which you have so unreservedly offered to me.\n\n\"I beg you will forgive the manner in which I received you on your\narrival in this house, after hearing the news of my sudden illness. I\nwas quite incapable of controlling myself--I was suffering an agony of\nmind which for the time deprived me of my senses. It is only your due\nthat I should now thank you for treating me with great forbearance at a\ntime when forbearance was mercy.\n\n\"I will mention what I wish you to do as plainly and briefly as I can.\n\n\"In the first place, I request you to dispose (as privately as possible)\nof every article of costume used in the dramatic Entertainment. I have\ndone with our performances forever; and I wish to be set free from\neverything which might accidentally connect me with them in the future.\nThe key of my box is inclosed in this letter.\n\n\"The other box, which contains my own dresses, you will be kind enough\nto forward to this house. I do not ask you to bring it yourself, because\nI have a far more important commission to intrust to you.\n\n\"Referring to the note which you left for me at your departure, I\nconclude that you have by this time traced Mr. Noel Vanstone from\nVauxhall Walk to the residence which he is now occupying. If you have\nmade the discovery--and if you are quite sure of not having drawn the\nattention either of Mrs. Lecount or her master to yourself--I wish you\nto arrange immediately for my residing (with you and Mrs. Wragge) in the\nsame town or village in which Mr. Noel Vanstone has taken up his abode.\nI write this, it is hardly necessary to say, under the impression that,\nwherever he may now be living, he is settled in the place for some\nlittle time.\n\n\"If you can find a small furnished house for me on these conditions\nwhich is to be let by the month, take it for a month certain to begin\nwith. Say that it is for your wife, your niece, and yourself, and use\nany assumed name you please, as long as it is a name that can be trusted\nto defeat the most suspicious inquiries. I leave this to your experience\nin such matters. The secret of who we really are must be kept as\nstrictly as if it was a secret on which our lives depend.\n\n\"Any expenses to which you may be put in carrying out my wishes I will\nimmediately repay. If you easily find the sort of house I want, there\nis no need for your returning to London to fetch us. We can join you as\nsoon as we know where to go. The house must be perfectly respectable,\nand must be reasonably near to Mr. Noel Vanstone's present residence,\nwherever that is.\n\n\"You must allow me to be silent in this letter as to the object which I\nhave now in view. I am unwilling to risk an explanation in writing. When\nall our preparations are made, you shall hear what I propose to do\nfrom my own lips; and I shall expect you to tell me plainly, in return,\nwhether you will or will not give me the help I want on the best terms\nwhich I am able to offer you.\n\n\"One word more before I seal up this letter.\n\n\"If any opportunity falls in your way after you have taken the house,\nand before we join you, of exchanging a few civil words either with\nMr. Noel Vanstone or Mrs. Lecount, take advantage of it. It is very\nimportant to my present object that we should become acquainted with\neach other--as the purely accidental result of our being near neighbors.\nI want you to smooth the way toward this end if you can, before Mrs.\nWragge and I come to you. Pray throw away no chance of observing Mrs.\nLecount, in particular, very carefully. Whatever help you can give me\nat the outset in blindfolding that woman's sharp eyes will be the most\nprecious help I have ever received at your hands.\n\n\"There is no need to answer this letter immediately--unless I have\nwritten it under a mistaken impression of what you have accomplished\nsince leaving London. I have taken our lodgings on for another week; and\nI can wait to hear from you until you are able to send me such news as\nI wish to receive. You may be quite sure of my patience for the future,\nunder all possible circumstances. My caprices are at an end, and my\nviolent temper has tried your forbearance for the last time.\n\n\"MAGDALEN.\"\n\n\nXII.\n\n_From Captain Wragge to Magdalen._\n\n\"North Shingles Villa, Aldborough, Suffolk, July 22d.\n\n\"MY DEAR GIRL--Your letter has charmed and touched me. Your excuses have\ngone straight to my heart; and your confidence in my humble abilities\nhas followed in the sa me direction. The pulse of the old militia-man\nthrobs with pride as he thinks of the trust you have placed in him,\nand vows to deserve it. Don't be surprised at this genial outburst.\nAll enthusiastic natures must explode occasionally; and _my_ form of\nexplosion is--Words.\n\n\"Everything you wanted me to do is done. The house is taken; the name is\nfound; and I am personally acquainted with Mrs. Lecount. After reading\nthis general statement, you will naturally be interested in possessing\nyour mind next of the accompanying details. Here they are, at your\nservice:\n\n\"The day after leaving you in London, I traced Mr. Noel Vanstone to\nthis curious little seaside snuggery. One of his father's innumerable\nbargains was a house at Aldborough--a rising watering-place, or Mr.\nMichael Vanstone would not have invested a farthing in it. In this house\nthe despicable little miser, who lived rent free in London, now lives,\nrent free again, on the coast of Suffolk. He is settled in his present\nabode for the summer and autumn; and you and Mrs. Wragge have only to\njoin me here, to be established five doors away from him in this elegant\nvilla. I have got the whole house for three guineas a week, with\nthe option of remaining through the autumn at the same price. In a\nfashionable watering-place, such a residence would have been cheap at\ndouble the money.\n\n\"Our new name has been chosen with a wary eye to your suggestions. My\nbooks--I hope you have not forgotten my Books?--contain, under the\nheading of _Skins To Jump Into,_ a list of individuals retired from this\nmortal scene, with whose names, families, and circumstances I am well\nacquainted. Into some of those Skins I have been compelled to Jump, in\nthe exercise of my profession, at former periods of my career. Others\nare still in the condition of new dresses and remain to be tried on. The\nSkin which will exactly fit us originally clothed the bodies of a family\nnamed Bygrave. I am in Mr. Bygrave's skin at this moment-and it fits\nwithout a wrinkle. If you will oblige me by slipping into Miss\nBygrave (Christian name, Susan); and if you will afterward push Mrs.\nWragge--anyhow; head foremost if you like--into Mrs. Bygrave (Christian\nname, Julia), the transformation will be complete. Permit me to inform\nyou that I am your paternal uncle. My worthy brother was established\ntwenty years ago in the mahogany and logwood trade at Belize, Honduras.\nHe died in that place; and is buried on the south-west side of the local\ncemetery, with a neat monument of native wood carved by a self-taught\nnegro artist. Nineteen months afterward his widow died of apoplexy at a\nboarding-house in Cheltenham. She was supposed to be the most corpulent\nwoman in England, and was accommodated on the ground-floor of the house\nin consequence of the difficulty of getting her up and down stairs. You\nare her only child; you have been under my care since the sad event at\nCheltenham; you are twenty-one years old on the second of August next;\nand, corpulence excepted, you are the living image of your mother. I\ntrouble you with these specimens of my intimate knowledge of our new\nfamily Skin, to quiet your mind on the subject of future inquiries.\nTrust to me and my books to satisfy any amount of inquiry. In the\nmeantime write down our new name and address, and see how they strike\nyou: 'Mr. Bygrave, Mrs. Bygrave, Miss Bygrave; North Shingles Villa,\nAldborough.' Upon my life, it reads remarkably well!\n\n\"The last detail I have to communicate refers to my acquaintance with\nMrs. Lecount.\n\n\"We met yesterday, in the grocer's shop here. Keeping my ears open, I\nfound that Mrs. Lecount wanted a particular kind of tea which the man\nhad not got, and which he believed could not be procured any nearer than\nIpswich. I instantly saw my way to beginning an acquaintance, at the\ntrifling expense of a journey to that flourishing city. 'I have business\nto-day in Ipswich,' I said, 'and I propose returning to Aldborough (if I\ncan get back in time) this evening. Pray allow me to take your order\nfor the tea, and to bring it back with my own parcels.' Mrs. Lecount\npolitely declined giving me the trouble--I politely insisted on taking\nit. We fell into conversation. There is no need to trouble you with\nour talk. The result of it on my mind is--that Mrs. Lecount's one weak\npoint, if she has such a thing at all, is a taste for science, implanted\nby her deceased husband, the professor. I think I see a chance here of\nworking my way into her good graces, and casting a little needful dust\ninto those handsome black eyes of hers. Acting on this idea when I\npurchased the lady's tea at Ipswich, I also bought on my own account\nthat far-famed pocket-manual of knowledge, 'Joyce's Scientific\nDialogues.' Possessing, as I do, a quick memory and boundless confidence\nin myself, I propose privately inflating my new skin with as much\nready-made science as it will hold, and presenting Mr. Bygrave to Mrs.\nLecount's notice in the character of the most highly informed man she\nhas met with since the professor's death. The necessity of blindfolding\nthat woman (to use your own admirable expression) is as clear to me\nas to you. If it is to be done in the way I propose, make your mind\neasy--Wragge, inflated by Joyce, is the man to do it.\n\n\"You now have my whole budget of news. Am I, or am I not, worthy of your\nconfidence in me? I say nothing of my devouring anxiety to know what\nyour objects really are--that anxiety will be satisfied when we meet.\nNever yet, my dear girl, did I long to administer a productive pecuniary\nSqueeze to any human creature, as I long to administer it to Mr. Noel\nVanstone. I say no more. _Verbum sap._ Pardon the pedantry of a Latin\nquotation, and believe me,\n\n\"Entirely yours,\n\n\"HORATIO WRAGGE.\n\n\"P.S.--I await my instructions, as you requested. You have only to say\nwhether I shall return to London for the purpose of escorting you to\nthis place, or whether I shall wait here to receive you. The house is in\nperfect order, the weather is charming, and the sea is as smooth as Mrs.\nLecount's apron. She has just passed the window, and we have exchanged\nbows. A sharp woman, my dear Magdalen; but Joyce and I together may\nprove a trifle too much for her.\"\n\n\nXIII.\n\n_Extract from the \"East Suffolk Argus.\"_\n\n\"ALDBOROUGH.--We notice with pleasure the arrival of visitors to this\nhealthful and far-famed watering-place earlier in the season than usual\nduring the present year. _Esto Perpetua_ is all we have to say.\n\n\"VISITORS' LIST.--Arrivals since our last. North Shingles Villa--Mrs.\nBygrave; Miss Bygrave.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FOURTH SCENE.\n\nALDBOROUGH, SUFFOLK.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE most striking spectacle presented to a stranger by the shores of\nSuffolk is the extraordinary defenselessness of the land against the\nencroachments of the sea.\n\nAt Aldborough, as elsewhere on this coast, local traditions are, for the\nmost part, traditions which have been literally drowned. The site of\nthe old town, once a populous and thriving port, has almost entirely\ndisappeared in the sea. The German Ocean has swallowed up streets,\nmarket-places, jetties, and public walks; and the merciless waters,\nconsummating their work of devastation, closed, no longer than eighty\nyears since, over the salt-master's cottage at Aldborough, now famous in\nmemory only as the birthplace of the poet CRABBE.\n\nThrust back year after year by the advancing waves, the inhabitants have\nreceded, in the present century, to the last morsel of land which is\nfirm enough to be built on--a strip of ground hemmed in between a marsh\non one side and the sea on the other. Here, trusting for their future\nsecurity to certain sand-hills which the capricious waves have thrown\nup to encourage them, the people of Aldborough have boldly established\ntheir quaint little watering-place. The first fragment of their earthly\npossessions is a low natural dike of shingle, surmounted by a public\npath which runs parallel with the sea. Bordering this path, in a broken,\nuneven line, are the villa residences of modern Aldborough--fanciful\nlittle houses, standing mostly in their own gardens, and possessing here\nand there, as horticultural ornaments, staring figure-heads of ships\ndoing duty for statues among the flowers. Viewed from the low level\non which th ese villas stand, the sea, in certain conditions of the\natmosphere, appears to be higher than the land: coasting-vessels gliding\nby assume gigantic proportions, and look alarmingly near the windows.\nIntermixed with the houses of the better sort are buildings of other\nforms and periods. In one direction the tiny Gothic town-hall of old\nAldborough--once the center of the vanished port and borough--now\nstands, fronting the modern villas close on the margin of the sea. At\nanother point, a wooden tower of observation, crowned by the figure-head\nof a wrecked Russian vessel, rises high above the neighboring houses,\nand discloses through its scuttle-window grave men in dark clothing\nseated on the topmost story, perpetually on the watch--the pilots of\nAldborough looking out from their tower for ships in want of help.\nBehind the row of buildings thus curiously intermingled runs the one\nstraggling street of the town, with its sturdy pilots' cottages, its\nmouldering marine store-houses, and its composite shops. Toward the\nnorthern end this street is bounded by the one eminence visible over all\nthe marshy flat--a low wooded hill, on which the church is built. At its\nopposite extremity the street leads to a deserted martello tower, and to\nthe forlorn outlying suburb of Slaughden, between the river Alde and the\nsea. Such are the main characteristics of this curious little outpost on\nthe shores of England as it appears at the present time.\n\n\nOn a hot and cloudy July afternoon, and on the second day which had\nelapsed since he had written to Magdalen, Captain Wragge sauntered\nthrough the gate of North Shingles Villa to meet the arrival of the\ncoach, which then connected Aldborough with the Eastern Counties\nRailway. He reached the principal inn as the coach drove up, and was\nready at the door to receive Magdalen and Mrs. Wragge, on their leaving\nthe vehicle.\n\nThe captain's reception of his wife was not characterized by an\ninstant's unnecessary waste of time. He looked distrustfully at her\nshoes--raised himself on tiptoe--set her bonnet straight for her with a\nsharp tug---said, in a loud whisper, \"hold your tongue\"--and left her,\nfor the time being, without further notice. His welcome to Magdalen,\nbeginning with the usual flow of words, stopped suddenly in the middle\nof the first sentence. Captain Wragge's eye was a sharp one, and it\ninstantly showed him something in the look and manner of his old pupil\nwhich denoted a serious change.\n\nThere was a settled composure on her face which, except when she spoke,\nmade it look as still and cold as marble. Her voice was softer and more\nequable, her eyes were steadier, her step was slower than of old.\nWhen she smiled, the smile came and went suddenly, and showed a little\nnervous contraction on one side of her mouth never visible there before.\nShe was perfectly patient with Mrs. Wragge; she treated the captain with\na courtesy and consideration entirely new in his experience of her--but\nshe was interested in nothing. The curious little shops in the back\nstreet; the high impending sea; the old town-hall on the beach; the\npilots, the fishermen, the passing ships--she noticed all these objects\nas indifferently as if Aldborough had been familiar to her from her\ninfancy. Even when the captain drew up at the garden-gate of North\nShingles, and introduced her triumphantly to the new house, she hardly\nlooked at it. The first question she asked related not to her own\nresidence, but to Noel Vanstone's.\n\n\"How near to us does he live?\" she inquired, with the only betrayal of\nemotion which had escaped her yet.\n\nCaptain Wragge answered by pointing to the fifth villa from North\nShingles, on the Slaughden side of Aldborough. Magdalen suddenly drew\nback from the garden-gate as he indicated the situation, and walked away\nby herself to obtain a nearer view of the house. Captain Wragge looked\nafter her, and shook his head, discontentedly.\n\n\"May I speak now?\" inquired a meek voice behind him, articulating\nrespectfully ten inches above the top of his straw hat.\n\nThe captain turned round, and confronted his wife. The more than\nordinary bewilderment visible in her face at once suggested to him that\nMagdalen had failed to carry out the directions in his letter; and that\nMrs. Wragge had arrived at Aldborough without being properly aware of\nthe total transformation to be accomplished in her identity and her\nname. The necessity of setting this doubt at rest was too serious to\nbe trifled with; and Captain Wragge instituted the necessary inquiries\nwithout a moment's delay.\n\n\"Stand straight, and listen to me,\" he began. \"I have a question to ask\nyou. Do you know whose Skin you are in at this moment? Do you know\nthat you are dead and buried in London; and that you have risen like a\nphoenix from the ashes of Mrs. Wragge? No! you evidently don't know it.\nThis is perfectly disgraceful. What is your name?\"\n\n\"Matilda,\" answered Mrs. Wragge, in a state of the densest bewilderment.\n\n\"Nothing of the sort!\" cried the captain, fiercely. \"How dare you tell\nme your name's Matilda? Your name is Julia. Who am I?--Hold that basket\nof sandwiches straight, or I'll pitch it into the sea!--Who am I?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mrs. Wragge, meekly taking refuge in the negative\nside of the question this time.\n\n\"Sit down!\" said her husband, pointing to the low garden wall of North\nShingles Villa. \"More to the right! More still! That will do. You don't\nknow?\" repeated the captain, sternly confronting his wife as soon as\nhe had contrived, by seating her, to place her face on a level with his\nown. \"Don't let me hear you say that a second time. Don't let me have\na woman who doesn't know who I am to operate on my beard to-morrow\nmorning. Look at me! More to the left--more still--that will do. Who am\nI? I'm Mr. Bygrave--Christian name, Thomas. Who are you? You're Mrs.\nBygrave--Christian name, Julia. Who is that young lady who traveled with\nyou from London? That young lady is Miss Bygrave--Christian name, Susan.\nI'm her clever uncle Tom; and you're her addle-headed aunt Julia. Say it\nall over to me instantly, like the Catechism! What is your name?\"\n\n\"Spare my poor head!\" pleaded Mrs. Wragge. \"Oh, please spare my poor\nhead till I've got the stage-coach out of it!\"\n\n\"Don't distress her,\" said Magdalen, joining them at that moment. \"She\nwill learn it in time. Come into the house.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge shook his wary head once more. \"We are beginning badly,\"\nhe said, with less politeness than usual. \"My wife's stupidity stands\nin our way already.\"\n\nThey went into the house. Magdalen was perfectly satisfied with all the\ncaptain's arrangements; she accepted the room which he had set apart\nfor her; approved of the woman servant whom he had engaged; presented\nherself at tea-time the moment she was summoned but still showed no\ninterest whatever in the new scene around her. Soon after the table\nwas cleared, although the daylight had not yet faded out, Mrs. Wragge's\ncustomary drowsiness after fatigue of any kind overcame her, and she\nreceived her husband's orders to leave the room (taking care that she\nleft it \"up at heel\"), and to betake herself (strictly in the character\nof Mrs. Bygrave) to bed. As soon as they were left alone, the captain\nlooked hard at Magdalen, and waited to be spoken to. She said nothing.\nHe ventured next on opening the conversation by a polite inquiry after\nthe state of her health. \"You look fatigued,\" he remarked, in his most\ninsinuating manner. \"I am afraid the journey has been too much for you.\"\n\n\"No,\" she said, looking out listlessly through the window; \"I am not\nmore tired than usual. I am always weary now; weary at going to bed,\nweary at getting up. If you would like to hear what I have to say to you\nto-night, I am willing and ready to say it. Can't we go out? It is\nvery hot here; and the droning of those men's voices is beyond all\nendurance.\" She pointed through the window to a group of boatmen idling,\nas only nautical men can idle, against the garden wall. \"Is there no\nquiet walk in this wretched place?\" she asked, impatiently. \"Can't we\nbreathe a little fresh air, and escape being annoyed by strangers?\"\n\n\"There is perfect solitude within half an hour's walk of the house,\"\nreplied the ready captain.\n\n\"Very well. Come out, then.\"\n\nWith a weary sigh she took up her straw bonnet and her light muslin\nscarf from the side-table upon which she had thrown them on coming in,\nand carelessly led the way to the door. Captain Wragge followed her to\nthe garden gate, then stopped, struck by a new idea.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he whispered, confidentially. \"In my wife's existing state\nof ignorance as to who she is, we had better not trust her alone in the\nhouse with a new servant. I'll privately turn the key on her, in case\nshe wakes before we come back. Safe bind, safe find--you know the\nproverb!--I will be with you again in a moment.\"\n\nHe hastened back to the house, and Magdalen seated herself on the garden\nwall to await his return.\n\nShe had hardly settled herself in that position when two gentlemen\nwalking together, whose approach along the public path she had not\npreviously noticed, passed close by her.\n\nThe dress of one of the two strangers showed him to be a clergyman.\nHis companion's station in life was less easily discernible to ordinary\nobservation. Practiced eyes would probably have seen enough in his look,\nhis manner, and his walk to show that he was a sailor. He was a man in\nthe prime of life; tall, spare, and muscular; his face sun-burned to a\ndeep brown; his black hair just turning gray; his eyes dark, deep and\nfirm--the eyes of a man with an iron resolution and a habit of command.\nHe was the nearest of the two to Magdalen, as he and his friend passed\nthe place where she was sitting; and he looked at her with a sudden\nsurprise at her beauty, with an open, hearty, undisguised admiration,\nwhich was too evidently sincere, too evidently beyond his own control,\nto be justly resented as insolent; and yet, in her humor at that moment,\nMagdalen did resent it. She felt the man's resolute black eyes\nstrike through her with an electric suddenness; and frowning at him\nimpatiently, she turned away her head and looked back at the house.\n\nThe next moment she glanced round again to see if he had gone on. He\nhad advanced a few yards--had then evidently stopped--and was now in\nthe very act of turning to look at her once more. His companion, the\nclergyman, noticing that Magdalen appeared to be annoyed, took him\nfamiliarly by the arm, and, half in jest, half in earnest, forced him to\nwalk on. The two disappeared round the corner of the next house. As they\nturned it, the sun-burned sailor twice stopped his companion again, and\ntwice looked back.\n\n\"A friend of yours?\" inquired Captain Wragge, joining Magdalen at that\nmoment.\n\n\"Certainly not,\" she replied; \"a perfect stranger. He stared at me in\nthe most impertinent manner. Does he belong to this place?\"\n\n\"I'll find out in a moment,\" said the compliant captain, joining the\ngroup of boatmen, and putting his questions right and left, with the\neasy familiarity which distinguished him. He returned in a few minutes\nwith a complete budget of information. The clergyman was well known as\nthe rector of a place situated some few miles inland. The dark man with\nhim was his wife's brother, commander of a ship in the merchant-service.\nHe was supposed to be staying with his relatives, as their guest for\na short time only, preparatory to sailing on another voyage. The\nclergyman's name was Strickland, and the merchant-captain's name was\nKirke; and that was all the boatmen knew about either of them.\n\n\"It is of no consequence who they are,\" said Magdalen, carelessly. \"The\nman's rudeness merely annoyed me for the moment. Let us have done with\nhim. I have something else to think of, and so have you. Where is the\nsolitary walk you mentioned just now? Which way do we go?\"\n\nThe captain pointed southward toward Slaughden, and offered his arm.\n\nMagdalen hesitated before she took it. Her eyes wandered away\ninquiringly to Noel Vanstone's house. He was out in the garden, pacing\nbackward and forward over the little lawn, with his head high in the\nair, and with Mrs. Lecount demurely in attendance on him, carrying her\nmaster's green fan. Seeing this, Magdalen at once took Captain Wragge's\nright arm, so as to place herself nearest to the garden when they passed\nit on their walk.\n\n\"The eyes of our neighbors are on us; and the least your niece can do is\nto take your arm,\" she said, with a bitter laugh. \"Come! let us go on.\"\n\n\"They are looking this way,\" whispered the captain. \"Shall I introduce\nyou to Mrs. Lecount?\"\n\n\"Not to-night,\" she answered. \"Wait, and hear what I have to say to you\nfirst.\"\n\nThey passed the garden wall. Captain Wragge took off his hat with a\nsmart flourish, and received a gracious bow from Mrs. Lecount in return.\nMagdalen saw the housekeeper survey her face, her figure, and her dress,\nwith that reluctant interest, that distrustful curiosity, which women\nfeel in observing each other. As she walked on beyond the house, the\nsharp voice of Noel Vanstone reached her through the evening stillness.\n\"A fine girl, Lecount,\" she heard him say. \"You know I am a judge of\nthat sort of thing--a fine girl!\"\n\nAs those words were spoken, Captain Wragge looked round at his companion\nin sudden surprise. Her hand was trembling violently on his arm, and her\nlips were fast closed with an expression of speechless pain.\n\nSlowly and in silence the two walked on until they reached the southern\nlimit of the houses, and entered on a little wilderness of shingle and\nwithered grass--the desolate end of Aldborough, the lonely beginning of\nSlaughden.\n\nIt was a dull, airless evening. Eastward, was the gray majesty of the\nsea, hushed in breathless calm; the horizon line invisibly melting into\nthe monotonous, misty sky; the idle ships shadowy and still on the idle\nwater. Southward, the high ridge of the sea dike, and the grim, massive\ncircle of a martello tower reared high on its mound of grass, closed the\nview darkly on all that lay beyond. Westward, a lurid streak of sunset\nglowed red in the dreary heaven, blackened the fringing trees on the\nfar borders of the great inland marsh, and turned its little gleaming\nwater-pools to pools of blood. Nearer to the eye, the sullen flow of\nthe tidal river Alde ebbed noiselessly from the muddy banks; and nearer\nstill, lonely and unprosperous by the bleak water-side, lay the lost\nlittle port of Slaughden, with its forlorn wharfs and warehouses of\ndecaying wood, and its few scattered coasting-vessels deserted on the\noozy river-shore. No fall of waves was heard on the beach, no trickling\nof waters bubbled audibly from the idle stream. Now and then the cry\nof a sea-bird rose from the region of the marsh; and at intervals, from\nfarmhouses far in the inland waste, the faint winding of horns to call\nthe cattle home traveled mournfully through the evening calm.\n\nMagdalen drew her hand from the captain's arm, and led the way to the\nmound of the martello tower. \"I am weary of walking,\" she said. \"Let us\nstop and rest here.\"\n\nShe seated herself on the slope, and resting on her elbow, mechanically\npulled up and scattered from her into the air the tufts of grass growing\nunder her hand. After silently occupying herself in this way for some\nminutes, she turned suddenly on Captain Wragge. \"Do I surprise you?\" she\nasked, with a startling abruptness. \"Do you find me changed?\"\n\nThe captain's ready tact warned him that the time had come to be plain\nwith her, and to reserve his flowers of speech for a more appropriate\noccasion.\n\n\"If you ask the question, I must answer it,\" he replied. \"Yes, I do find\nyou changed.\"\n\nShe pulled up another tuft of grass. \"I suppose you can guess the\nreason?\" she said.\n\nThe captain was wisely silent. He only answered by a bow.\n\n\"I have lost all care for myself,\" she went on, tearing faster and\nfaster at the tufts of grass. \"Saying that is not saying much, perhaps,\nbut it may help you to understand me. There are things I would have died\nsooner than do at one time--things it would have turned me cold to think\nof. I don't care now whether I do them or not. I am nothing to myself; I\nam no more interested in myself than I am in these handfuls of grass.\nI suppose I have lost something. What is it? Heart? Conscience? I don't\nknow. Do you? W hat nonsense I am talking! Who cares what I have lost?\nIt has gone; and there's an end of it. I suppose my outside is the best\nside of me--and that's left, at any rate. I have not lost my good looks,\nhave I? There! there! never mind answering; don't trouble yourself to\npay me compliments. I have been admired enough to-day. First the sailor,\nand then Mr. Noel Vanstone--enough for any woman's vanity, surely! Have\nI any right to call myself a woman? Perhaps not: I am only a girl in\nmy teens. Oh, me, I feel as if I was forty!\" She scattered the last\nfragments of grass to the winds; and turning her back on the captain,\nlet her head droop till her cheek touched the turf bank. \"It feels\nsoft and friendly,\" she said, nestling to it with a hopeless tenderness\nhorrible to see. \"It doesn't cast me off. Mother Earth! The only mother\nI have left!\"\n\nCaptain Wragge looked at her in silent surprise. Such experience of\nhumanity as he possessed was powerless to sound to its depths the\nterrible self-abandonment which had burst its way to the surface in her\nreckless words--which was now fast hurrying her to actions more reckless\nstill. \"Devilish odd!\" he thought to himself, uneasily. \"Has the loss of\nher lover turned her brain?\" He considered for a minute longer and\nthen spoke to her. \"Leave it till to-morrow,\" suggested the captain\nconfidentially. \"You are a little tired to-night. No hurry, my dear\ngirl--no hurry.\"\n\nShe raised her head instantly, and looked round at him with the same\nangry resolution, with the same desperate defiance of herself, which\nhe had seen in her face on the memorable day at York when she had acted\nbefore him for the first time. \"I came here to tell you what is in my\nmind,\" she said; \"and I _will_ tell it!\" She seated herself upright on\nthe slope; and clasping her hands round her knees, looked out steadily,\nstraight before her, at the slowly darkening view. In that strange\nposition, she waited until she had composed herself, and then addressed\nthe captain, without turning her head to look round at him, in these\nwords:\n\n\"When you and I first met,\" she began, abruptly, \"I tried hard to keep\nmy thoughts to myself. I know enough by this time to know that I failed.\nWhen I first told you at York that Michael Vanstone had ruined us, I\nbelieve you guessed for yourself that I, for one, was determined not to\nsubmit to it. Whether you guessed or not, it is so. I left my friends\nwith that determination in my mind; and I feel it in me now stronger,\nten times stronger, than ever.\"\n\n\"Ten times stronger than ever,\" echoed the captain. \"Exactly so--the\nnatural result of firmness of character.\"\n\n\"No--the natural result of having nothing else to think of. I had\nsomething else to think of before you found me ill in Vauxhall Walk. I\nhave nothing else to think of now. Remember that, if you find me for the\nfuture always harping on the same string. One question first. Did\nyou guess what I meant to do on that morning when you showed me the\nnewspaper, and when I read the account of Michael Vanstone's death?\"\n\n\"Generally,\" replied Captain Wragge--\"I guessed, generally, that you\nproposed dipping your hand into his purse and taking from it (most\nproperly) what was your own. I felt deeply hurt at the time by your not\npermitting me to assist you. Why is she so reserved with me? (I remarked\nto myself)--why is she so unreasonably reserved?\"\n\n\"You shall have no reserve to complain of now,\" pursued Magdalen. \"I\ntell you plainly, if events had not happened as they did, you _would_\nhave assisted me. If Michael Vanstone had not died, I should have gone\nto Brighton, and have found my way safely to his acquaintance under an\nassumed name. I had money enough with me to live on respectably for many\nmonths together. I would have employed that time--I would have waited\na whole year, if necessary, to destroy Mrs. Lecount's influence over\nhim--and I would have ended by getting that influence, on my own terms,\ninto my own hands. I had the advantage of years, the advantage of\nnovelty, the advantage of downright desperation, all on my side, and I\nshould have succeeded. Before the year was out--before half the year was\nout--you should have seen Mrs. Lecount dismissed by her master, and\nyou should have seen me taken into the house in her place, as Michael\nVanstone's adopted daughter--as the faithful friend--who had saved him\nfrom an adventuress in his old age. Girls no older than I am have tried\ndeceptions as hopeless in appearance as mine, and have carried them\nthrough to the end. I had my story ready; I had my plans all considered;\nI had the weak point in that old man to attack in my way, which Mrs.\nLecount had found out before me to attack in hers, and I tell you again\nI should have succeeded.\"\n\n\"I think you would,\" said the captain. \"And what next?\"\n\n\"Mr. Michael Vanstone would have changed his man of business next. You\nwould have succeeded to the place; and those clever speculations on\nwhich he was so fond of venturing would have cost him the fortunes of\nwhich he had robbed my sister and myself. To the last farthing, Captain\nWragge, as certainly as you sit there, to the last farthing! A\nbold conspiracy, a shocking deception--wasn't it? I don't care! Any\nconspiracy, any deception, is justified to my conscience by the vile law\nwhich has left us helpless. You talked of my reserve just now. Have I\ndropped it at last? Have I spoken out at the eleventh hour?\"\n\nThe captain laid his hand solemnly on his heart, and launched himself\nonce more on his broadest flow of language.\n\n\"You fill me with unavailing regret,\" he said. \"If that old man\nhad lived, what a crop I might have reaped from him! What enormous\ntransactions in moral agriculture it might have been my privilege to\ncarry on! _Ars longa,_\" said Captain Wragge, pathetically drifting into\nLatin--\"_vita brevis!_ Let us drop a tear on the lost opportunities of\nthe past, and try what the present can do to console us. One conclusion\nis clear to my mind--the experiment you proposed to try with Mr.\nMichael Vanstone is totally hopeless, my dear girl, in the case of his\nson. His son is impervious to all common forms of pecuniary temptation.\nYou may trust my solemn assurance,\" continued the captain, speaking\nwith an indignant recollection of the answer to his advertisement in\nthe Times, \"when I inform you that Mr. Noel Vanstone is emphatically the\nmeanest of mankind.\"\n\n\"I can trust my own experience as well,\" said Magdalen. \"I have\nseen him, and spoken to him--I know him better than you do. Another\ndisclosure, Captain Wragge, for your private ear! I sent you back\ncertain articles of costume when they had served the purpose for which I\ntook them to London. That purpose was to find my way to Noel Vanstone\nin disguise, and to judge for myself of Mrs. Lecount and her master. I\ngained my object; and I tell you again, I know the two people in that\nhouse yonder whom we have now to deal with better than you do.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge expressed the profound astonishment, and asked the\ninnocent questions appropriate to the mental condition of a person taken\ncompletely by surprise.\n\n\"Well,\" he resumed, when Magdalen had briefly answered him, \"and what is\nthe result on your own mind? There must be a result, or we should not be\nhere. You see your way? Of course, my dear girl, you see your way?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, quickly. \"I see my way.\"\n\nThe captain drew a little nearer to her, with eager curiosity expressed\nin every line of his vagabond face.\n\n\"Go on,\" he said, in an anxious whisper; \"pray go on.\"\n\nShe looked out thoughtfully into the gathering darkness, without\nanswering, without appearing to have heard him. Her lips closed, and her\nclasped hands tightened mechanically round her knees.\n\n\"There is no disguising the fact,\" said Captain Wragge, warily rousing\nher into speaking to him. \"The son is harder to deal with than the\nfather--\"\n\n\"Not in my way,\" she interposed, suddenly.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the captain. \"Well! they say there is a short cut to\neverything, if we only look long enough to find it. You have looked long\nenough, I suppose, and the natural result has followed--you have found\nit.\"\n\n\"I have not troubled myself to look; I have found it without looking.\"\n\n\"The deuce you have!\" cried Captain Wragge, in great perplexity. \"My\ndear girl, is my view of your present position leading me altogether\nastray? As I understand it, here is Mr. Noel Vanstone in possession of\nyour fortune and your sister's, as his father was, and determined to\nkeep it, as his father was?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And here are you--quite helpless to get it by persuasion--quite\nhelpless to get it by law--just as resolute in his ease as you were in\nhis father's, to take it by stratagem in spite of him?\"\n\n\"Just as resolute. Not for the sake of the fortune--mind that! For the\nsake of the right.\"\n\n\"Just so. And the means of coming at that right which were hard with the\nfather--who was not a miser--are easy with the son, who is?\"\n\n\"Perfectly easy.\"\n\n\"Write me down an Ass for the first time in my life!\" cried the captain,\nat the end of his patience. \"Hang me if I know what you mean!\"\n\nShe looked round at him for the first time--looked him straight and\nsteadily in the face.\n\n\"I will tell you what I mean,\" she said. \"I mean to marry him.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge started up on his knees, and stopped on them, petrified\nby astonishment.\n\n\"Remember what I told you,\" said Magdalen, looking away from him again.\n\"I have lost all care for myself. I have only one end in life now, and\nthe sooner I reach it--and die--the better. If--\" She stopped, altered\nher position a little, and pointed with one hand to the fast-ebbing\nstream beneath her, gleaming dim in the darkening twilight--\"if I had\nbeen what I once was, I would have thrown myself into that river sooner\nthan do what I am going to do now. As it is, I trouble myself no longer;\nI weary my mind with no more schemes. The short way and the vile way\nlies before me. I take it, Captain Wragge, and marry him.\"\n\n\"Keeping him in total ignorance of who you are?\" said the captain,\nslowly rising to his feet, and slowly moving round, so as to see her\nface. \"Marrying him as my niece, Miss Bygrave?\"\n\n\"As your niece, Miss Bygrave.\"\n\n\"And after the marriage--?\" His voice faltered, as he began the\nquestion, and he left it unfinished.\n\n\"After the marriage,\" she said, \"I shall stand in no further need of\nyour assistance.\"\n\nThe captain stooped as she gave him that answer, looked close at her,\nand suddenly drew back, without uttering a word. He walked away some\npaces, and sat down again doggedly on the grass. If Magdalen could have\nseen his face in the dying light, his face would have startled her. For\nthe first time, probably, since his boyhood, Captain Wragge had changed\ncolor. He was deadly pale.\n\n\"Have you nothing to say to me?\" she asked. \"Perhaps you are waiting\nto hear what terms I have to offer? These are my terms; I pay all our\nexpenses here; and when we part, on the day of the marriage, you take\na farewell gift away with you of two hundred pounds. Do you promise me\nyour assistance on those conditions?\"\n\n\"What am I expected to do?\" he asked, with a furtive glance at her, and\na sudden distrust in his voice.\n\n\"You are expected to preserve my assumed character and your own,\" she\nanswered, \"and you are to prevent any inquiries of Mrs. Lecount's\nfrom discovering who I really am. I ask no more. The rest is my\nresponsibility--not yours.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to do with what happens--at any time, or in any\nplace--after the marriage?\"\n\n\"Nothing whatever.\"\n\n\"I may leave you at the church door if I please?\"\n\n\"At the church door, with your fee in your pocket.\"\n\n\"Paid from the money in your own possession?\"\n\n\"Certainly! How else should I pay it?\"\n\nCaptain Wragge took off his hat, and passed his handkerchief over his\nface with an air of relief.\n\n\"Give me a minute to consider it,\" he said.\n\n\"As many minutes as you like,\" she rejoined, reclining on the bank in\nher former position, and returning to her former occupation of tearing\nup the tufts of grass and flinging them out into the air.\n\n\nThe captain's reflections were not complicated by any unnecessary\ndivergences from the contemplation of his own position to the\ncontemplation of Magdalen's. Utterly incapable of appreciating the\ninjury done her by Frank's infamous treachery to his engagement--an\ninjury which had severed her, at one cruel blow, from the aspiration\nwhich, delusion though it was, had been the saving aspiration of her\nlife--Captain Wragge accepted the simple fact of her despair just as he\nfound it, and then looked straight to the consequences of the proposal\nwhich she had made to him.\n\nIn the prospect _before_ the marriage he saw nothing more serious\ninvolved than the practice of a deception, in no important degree\ndifferent--except in the end to be attained by it--from the deceptions\nwhich his vagabond life had long since accustomed him to contemplate and\nto carry out. In the prospect _after_ the marriage he dimly discerned,\nthrough the ominous darkness of the future, the lurking phantoms of\nTerror and Crime, and the black gulfs behind them of Ruin and Death.\nA man of boundless audacity and resource, within his own mean limits;\nbeyond those limits, the captain was as deferentially submissive to the\nmajesty of the law as the most harmless man in existence; as cautious\nin looking after his own personal safety as the veriest coward that ever\nwalked the earth. But one serious question now filled his mind. Could\nhe, on the terms proposed to him, join the conspiracy against Noel\nVanstone up to the point of the marriage, and then withdraw from\nit, without risk of involving himself in the consequences which his\nexperience told him must certainly ensue?\n\nStrange as it may seem, his decision in this emergency was mainly\ninfluenced by no less a person than Noel Vanstone himself. The captain\nmight have resisted the money-offer which Magdalen had made to him--for\nthe profits of the Entertainment had filled his pockets with more than\nthree times two hundred pounds. But the prospect of dealing a blow in\nthe dark at the man who had estimated his information and himself at\nthe value of a five pound note proved too much for his caution and his\nself-control. On the small neutral ground of self-importance, the best\nmen and the worst meet on the same terms. Captain Wragge's indignation,\nwhen he saw the answer to his advertisement, stooped to no retrospective\nestimate of his own conduct; he was as deeply offended, as sincerely\nangry as if he had made a perfectly honorable proposal, and had been\nrewarded for it by a personal insult. He had been too full of his own\ngrievance to keep it out of his first letter to Magdalen. He had more or\nless forgotten himself on every subsequent occasion when Noel Vanstone's\nname was mentioned. And in now finally deciding the course he should\ntake, it is not too much to say that the motive of money receded, for\nthe first time in his life, into the second place, and the motive of\nmalice carried the day.\n\n\n\"I accept the terms,\" said Captain Wragge, getting briskly on his legs\nagain. \"Subject, of course, to the conditions agreed on between us. We\npart on the wedding-day. I don't ask where you go: you don't ask where I\ngo. From that time forth we are strangers to each other.\"\n\nMagdalen rose slowly from the mound. A hopeless depression, a sullen\ndespair, showed itself in her look and manner. She refused the captain's\noffered hand; and her tones, when she answered him, were so low that he\ncould hardly hear her.\n\n\"We understand each other,\" she said; \"and we can now go back. You may\nintroduce me to Mrs. Lecount to-morrow.\"\n\n\"I must ask a few questions first,\" said the captain, gravely. \"There\nare more risks to be run in this matter, and more pitfalls in our way,\nthan you seem to suppose. I must know the whole history of your morning\ncall on Mrs. Lecount before I put you and that woman on speaking terms\nwith each other.\"\n\n\"Wait till to-morrow,\" she broke out impatiently. \"Don't madden me by\ntalking about it to-night.\"\n\nThe captain said no more. They turned their faces toward Aldborough, and\nwalked slowly back.\n\nBy the time they reached the houses night had overtaken them. Neither\nmoon nor stars were visible. A faint noiseless breeze blowing from the\nland had come with the darkness. Magdalen paused on the lonely public\nwalk to breathe the air more freely. After a while she turned her face\nfrom the breeze and looked out toward the sea. The immeasurable silence\nof the calm waters, lost in the black void of night, was awful. She\nstood looking into the darkness, as if its mystery had no secrets for\nher--she advanced toward it slowly, as if it drew her by some hidden\nattraction into itself.\n\n\"I am going down to the sea,\" she said to her companion. \"Wait here, and\nI will come back.\"\n\nHe lost sight of her in an instant; it was as if the night had swallowed\nher up. He listened, and counted her footsteps by the crashing of them\non the shingle in the deep stillness. They retreated slowly, further and\nfurther away into the night. Suddenly the sound of them ceased. Had she\npaused on her course or had she reached one of the strips of sand left\nbare by the ebbing tide?\n\nHe waited, and listened anxiously. The time passed, and no sound reached\nhim. He still listened, with a growing distrust of the darkness. Another\nmoment, and there came a sound from the invisible shore. Far and faint\nfrom the beach below, a long cry moaned through the silence. Then all\nwas still once more.\n\nIn sudden alarm, he stepped forward to descend to the beach, and to\ncall to her. Before he could cross the path, footsteps rapidly advancing\ncaught his ear. He waited an instant, and the figure of a man passed\nquickly along the walk between him and the sea. It was too dark to\ndiscern anything of the stranger's face; it was only possible to see\nthat he was a tall man--as tall as that officer in the merchant-service\nwhose name was Kirke.\n\nThe figure passed on northward, and was instantly lost to view. Captain\nWragge crossed the path, and, advancing a few steps down the beach,\nstopped and listened again. The crash of footsteps on the shingle caught\nhis ear once more. Slowly, as the sound had left him, that sound now\ncame back. He called, to guide her to him. She came on till he could\njust see her--a shadow ascending the shingly slope, and growing out of\nthe blackness of the night.\n\n\"You alarmed me,\" he whispered, nervously. \"I was afraid something had\nhappened. I heard you cry out as if you were in pain.\"\n\n\"Did you?\" she said, carelessly. \"I _was_ in pain. It doesn't\nmatter--it's over now.\"\n\nHer hand mechanically swung something to and fro as she answered him.\nIt was the little white silk bag which she had always kept hidden in\nher bosom up to this time. One of the relics which it held--one of the\nrelics which she had not had the heart to part with before--was gone\nfrom its keeping forever. Alone, on a strange shore, she had torn from\nher the fondest of her virgin memories, the dearest of her virgin hopes.\nAlone, on a strange shore, she had taken the lock of Frank's hair from\nits once-treasured place, and had cast it away from her to the sea and\nthe night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE tall man who had passed Captain Wragge in the dark proceeded rapidly\nalong the public walk, struck off across a little waste patch of ground,\nand entered the open door of the Aldborough Hotel. The light in the\npassage, falling full on his face as he passed it, proved the truth of\nCaptain Wragge's surmise, and showed the stranger to be Mr. Kirke, of\nthe merchant service.\n\nMeeting the landlord in the passage, Mr. Kirke nodded to him with the\nfamiliarity of an old customer. \"Have you got the paper?\" he asked; \"I\nwant to look at the visitors' list.\"\n\n\"I have got it in my room, sir,\" said the landlord, leading the way\ninto a parlor at the back of the house. \"Are there any friends of yours\nstaying here, do you think?\"\n\nWithout replying, the seaman turned to the list as soon as the newspaper\nwas placed in his hand, and ran his finger down it, name by name.\nThe finger suddenly stopped at this line: \"Sea-view Cottage; Mr. Noel\nVanstone.\" Kirke of the merchant-service repeated the name to himself,\nand put down the paper thoughtfully.\n\n\"Have you found anybody you know, captain?\" asked the landlord.\n\n\"I have found a name I know--a name my father used often to speak of in\nhis time. Is this Mr. Vanstone a family man? Do you know if there is a\nyoung lady in the house?\"\n\n\"I can't say, captain. My wife will be here directly; she is sure to\nknow. It must have been some time ago, if your father knew this Mr.\nVanstone?\"\n\n\"It _was_ some time ago. My father knew a subaltern officer of that\nname when he was with his regiment in Canada. It would be curious if the\nperson here turned out to be the same man, and if that young lady was\nhis daughter.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, captain--but the young lady seems to hang a little on your\nmind,\" said the landlord, with a pleasant smile.\n\nMr. Kirke looked as if the form which his host's good-humor had just\ntaken was not quite to his mind. He returned abruptly to the subaltern\nofficer and the regiment in Canada. \"That poor fellow's story was as\nmiserable a one as ever I heard,\" he said, looking back again absently\nat the visitors' list.\n\n\"Would there be any harm in telling it, sir?\" asked the landlord.\n\"Miserable or not, a story's a story, when you know it to be true.\"\n\nMr. Kirke hesitated. \"I hardly think I should be doing right to tell\nit,\" he said. \"If this man, or any relations of his, are still alive, it\nis not a story they might like strangers to know. All I can tell you\nis, that my father was the salvation of that young officer under very\ndreadful circumstances. They parted in Canada. My father remained with\nhis regiment; the young officer sold out and returned to England, and\nfrom that moment they lost sight of each other. It would be curious if\nthis Vanstone here was the same man. It would be curious--\"\n\nHe suddenly checked himself just as another reference to \"the young\nlady\" was on the point of passing his lips. At the same moment the\nlandlord's wife came in, and Mr. Kirke at once transferred his inquiries\nto the higher authority in the house.\n\n\"Do you know anything of this Mr. Vanstone who is down here on the\nvisitors' list?\" asked the sailor. \"Is he an old man?\"\n\n\"He's a miserable little creature to look at,\" replied the landlady;\n\"but he's not old, captain.\"\n\n\"Then he's not the man I mean. Perhaps he is the man's son? Has he got\nany ladies with him?\"\n\nThe landlady tossed her head, and pursed up her lips disparagingly.\n\n\"He has a housekeeper with him,\" she said. \"A middle-aged person--not\none of my sort. I dare say I'm wrong--but I don't like a dressy woman in\nher station of life.\"\n\nMr. Kirke began to look puzzled. \"I must have made some mistake about\nthe house,\" he said. \"Surely there's a lawn cut octagon-shape\nat Sea-view Cottage, and a white flag-staff in the middle of the\ngravel-walk?\"\n\n\"That's not Sea-view, sir! It's North Shingles you're talking of. Mr.\nBygrave's. His wife and his niece came here by the coach to-day. His\nwife's tall enough to be put in a show, and the worst-dressed woman I\never set eyes on. But Miss Bygrave is worth looking at, if I may venture\nto say so. She's the finest girl, to my mind, we've had at Aldborough\nfor many a long day. I wonder who they are! Do you know the name,\ncaptain?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Kirke, with a shade of disappointment on his dark,\nweather-beaten face; \"I never heard the name before.\"\n\nAfter replying in those words, he rose to take his leave. The landlord\nvainly invited him to drink a parting glass; the landlady vainly pressed\nhim to stay another ten minutes and try a cup of tea. He only replied\nthat his sister expected him, and that he must return to the parsonage\nimmediately.\n\nOn leaving the hotel Mr. Kirke set his face westward, and walked inland\nalong the highroad as fast as the darkness would let him.\n\n\"Bygrave?\" he thought to himself. \"Now I know her name, how much am I\nthe wiser for it! If it had been Vanstone, my father's son might have\nhad a chance of making acquaintance with her.\" He stopped, and looked\nback in the direction of Aldborough. \"What a fool I am!\" he burst out\nsuddenly, striking his stick on the ground. \"I was forty last birthday.\"\nHe turned and went on again faster than ever--his head down; his\nresolute black eyes searching the darkness on the land as they had\nsearched it many a time on the sea from the deck of his ship.\n\nAfter more than an hour's walking he reached a village, with a primitive\nlittle church and parsonage nestled together in a hollow. He entered\nthe house by the back way, and found his sister, the clergyman's wife,\nsitting alone over her work in the parlor.\n\n\"Where is your husband, Lizzie?\" he asked, taking a chair in a corner.\n\n\"William has gone out to see a sick person. He had just time enough\nbefore he went,\" she added, with a smile, \"to tell me about the young\nlady; and he declares he will never trust himself at Aldborough with you\nagain until you are a steady, married man.\" She stopped, and looked at\nher brother more attentively than she had looked at him yet. \"Robert!\"\nshe said, laying aside her work, and suddenly crossing the room to him.\n\"You look anxious, you look distressed. William only laughed about your\nmeeting with the young lady. Is it serious? Tell me; what is she like?\"\n\nHe turned his head away at the question.\n\nShe took a stool at his feet, and persisted in looking up at him. \"Is it\nserious, Robert?\" she repeated, softly.\n\nKirke's weather-beaten face was accustomed to no concealments--it\nanswered for him before he spoke a word. \"Don't tell your husband till I\nam gone,\" he said, with a roughness quite new in his sister's experience\nof him. \"I know I only deserve to be laughed at; but it hurts me, for\nall that.\"\n\n\"Hurts you?\" she repeated, in astonishment.\n\n\"You can't think me half such a fool, Lizzie, as I think myself,\"\npursued Kirke, bitterly. \"A man at my age ought to know better. I didn't\nset eyes on her for as much as a minute altogether; and there I have\nbeen hanging about the place till after nightfall on the chance of\nseeing her again--skulking, I should have called it, if I had found one\nof my men doing what I have been doing myself. I believe I'm bewitched.\nShe's a mere girl, Lizzie--I doubt if she's out of her teens--I'm old\nenough to be her father. It's all one; she stops in my mind in spite of\nme. I've had her face looking at me, through the pitch darkness, every\nstep of the way to this house; and it's looking at me now--as plain as I\nsee yours, and plainer.\"\n\nHe rose impatiently, and began to walk backward and forward in the room.\nHis sister looked after him, with surprise as well as sympathy expressed\nin her face. From his boyhood upward she had always been accustomed to\nsee him master of himself. Years since, in the failing fortunes of the\nfamily, he had been their example and their support. She had heard of\nhim in the desperate emergencies of a life at sea, when hundreds of his\nfellow-creatures had looked to his steady self-possession for rescue\nfrom close-threatening death--and had not looked in vain. Never, in all\nher life before, had his sister seen the balance of that calm and equal\nmind lost as she saw it lost now.\n\n\"How can you talk so unreasonably about your age and yourself?\" she\nsaid. \"There is not a woman alive, Robert, who is good enough for you.\nWhat is her name?\"\n\n\"Bygrave. Do you know it?\"\n\n\"No. But I might soon make acquaintance with her. If we only had\na little time before us; if I could only get to Aldborough and see\nher--but you are going away to-morrow; your ship sails at the end of the\nweek.\"\n\n\"Thank God for that!\" said Kirke, fervently.\n\n\"Are you glad to be going away?\" she asked, more and more amazed at him.\n\n\"Right glad, Lizzie, for my own sake. If I ever get to my senses again,\nI shall find my way back to them on the deck of my ship. This girl has\ngot between me and my thoughts already: she shan't go a step further,\nand get between me and my duty. I'm determined on that. Fool as I am,\nI have sense enough left not to trust myself within easy hail of\nAldborough to-morrow morning. I'm good for another twenty miles of\nwalking, and I'll begin my journey back tonight.\"\n\nHis sister started up, and caught him fast by the arm. \"Robert!\" she\nexclaimed; \"you're not serious? You don't mean to leave us on foot,\nalone in the dark?\"\n\n\"It's only saying good-by, my dear, the last thing at night instead of\nthe first thing in the morning,\" he answered, with a smile. \"Try and\nmake allowances for me, Lizzie. My life has been passed at sea; and I'm\nnot used to having my mind upset in this way. Men ashore are used to\nit; men ashore can take it easy. I can't. If I stopped here I shouldn't\nrest. If I waited till to-morrow, I should only be going back to have\nanother look at her. I don't want to feel more ashamed of myself than I\ndo already. I want to fight my way back to my duty and myself, without\nstopping to think twice about it. Darkness is nothing to me--I'm used to\ndarkness. I have got the high-road to walk on, and I can't lose my way.\nLet me go, Lizzie! The only sweetheart I have any business with at my\nage is my ship. Let me get back to her!\"\n\nHis sister still kept her hold of his arm, and still pleaded with him\nto stay till the morning. He listened to her with perfect patience and\nkindness, but she never shook his determination for an instant.\n\n\"What am I to say to William?\" she pleaded. \"What will he think when he\ncomes back and finds you gone?\"\n\n\"Tell him I have taken the advice he gave us in his sermon last Sunday.\nSay I have turned my back on the world, the flesh, and the devil.\"\n\n\"How can you talk so, Robert! And the boys, too--you promised not to go\nwithout bidding the boys good-by.\"\n\n\"That's true. I made my little nephews a promise, and I'll keep it.\" He\nkicked off his shoes as he spoke, on the mat outside the door. \"Light me\nupstairs, Lizzie; I'll bid the two boys good-by without waking them.\"\n\nShe saw the uselessness of resisting him any longer; and, taking the\ncandle, went before him upstairs.\n\nThe boys--both young children--were sleeping together in the same bed.\nThe youngest was his uncle's favorite, and was called by his uncle's\nname. He lay peacefully asleep, with a rough little toy ship hugged fast\nin his arms. Kirke's eyes softened as he stole on tiptoe to the child's\nside, and kissed him with the gentleness of a woman. \"Poor little man!\"\nsaid the sailor, tenderly. \"He is as fond of his ship as I was at his\nage. I'll cut him out a better one when I come back. Will you give me my\nnephew one of these days, Lizzie, and will you let me make a sailor of\nhim?\"\n\n\"Oh, Robert, if you were only married and happy, as I am!\"\n\n\"The time has gone by, my dear. I must make the best of it as I am, with\nmy little nephew there to help me.\"\n\nHe left the room. His sister's tears fell fast as she followed him into\nthe parlor. \"There is something so forlorn and dreadful in your leaving\nus like this,\" she said. \"Shall I go to Aldborough to-morrow, Robert,\nand try if I can get acquainted with her for your sake?\"\n\n\"No!\" he replied. \"Let her be. If it's ordered that I am to see that\ngirl again, I _shall_ see her. Leave it to the future, and you leave\nit right.\" He put on his shoes, and took up his hat and stick. \"I won't\noverwalk myself,\" he said, cheerfully. \"If the coach doesn't overtake me\non the road, I can wait for it where I stop to breakfast. Dry your eyes,\nmy dear, and give me a kiss.\"\n\nShe was like her brother in features and complexion, and she had a touch\nof her brother's spirit; she dashed away the tears, and took her leave\nof him bravely.\n\n\"I shall be back in a year's time,\" said Kirke, falling into his old\nsailor-like way at the door. \"I'll bring you a China shawl, Lizzie, and\na chest of tea for your store-room. Don't let the boys forget me, and\ndon't think I'm doing wrong to leave you in this way. I know I am doing\nright. God bless you and keep you, my dear--and your husband, and your\nchildren! Good-by!\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed her. She ran to the door to look after him. A puff\nof air extinguished the candle, and the black night shut him out from\nher in an instant.\n\n\nThree days afterward the first-class merchantman _Deliverance_, Kirke,\ncommander, sailed from London for the China Sea.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE threatening of storm and change passed away with the night. When\nmorning rose over Aldborough, the sun was master in the blue heaven, and\nthe waves were rippling gayly under the summer breeze.\n\nAt an hour when no other visitors to the watering--place were yet astir,\nthe indefatigable Wragge appeared at the door of North Shingles Villa,\nand directed his steps northward, with a neatly-bound copy of \"Joyce's\nScientific Dialogues\" in his hand. Arriving at the waste ground beyond\nthe houses, he descended to the beach and opened his book. The interview\nof the past night had sharpened his perception of the difficulties to\nbe encountered in the coming enterprise. He was now doubly determined to\ntry the characteristic experiment at which he had hinted in his letter\nto Magdalen, and to concentrate on himself--in the character of a\nremarkably well-informed man--the entire interest and attention of the\nformidable Mrs. Lecount.\n\nHaving taken his dose of ready-made science (to use his own expression)\nthe first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, Captain Wragge\njoined his small family circle at breakfast-time, inflated with\ninformation for the day. He observed that Magdalen's face showed plain\nsigns of a sleepless night. She made no complaint: her manner was\ncomposed, and her temper perfectly under control. Mrs. Wragge--refreshed\nby some thirteen consecutive hours of uninterrupted repose--was in\nexcellent spirits, and up at heel (for a wonder) with both shoes. She\nbrought with her into the room several large sheets of tissue-paper,\ncut crisply into mysterious and many-varying forms, which immediately\nprovoked from her husband the short and sharp question, \"What have you\ngot there?\"\n\n\"Patterns, captain,\" said Mrs. Wragge, in timidly conciliating tones. \"I\nwent shopping in London, and bought an Oriental Cashmere Robe. It cost a\ndeal of money; and I'm going to try and save, by making it myself. I've\ngot my patterns, and my dress-making directions written out as plain as\nprint. I'll be very tidy, captain; I'll keep in my own corner, if you'll\nplease to give me one; and whether my head Buzzes, or whether it don't,\nI'll sit straight at my work all the same.\"\n\n\"You will do your work,\" said the captain, sternly, \"when you know who\nyou are, who I am, and who that young lady is--not before. Show me your\nshoes! Good. Show me you cap! Good. Make the breakfast.\"\n\nWhen breakfast was over, Mrs. Wragge received her orders to retire into\nan adjoining room, and to wait there until her husband came to release\nher. As soon as her back was turned, Captain Wragge at once resumed the\nconversation which had been suspended, by Magdalen's own desire, on\nthe preceding night. The questions he now put to her all related to the\nsubject of her visit in disguise to Noel Vanstone's house. They were\nthe questions of a thoroughly clear-headed man--short, searching, and\nstraight to the point. In less than half an hour's time he had made\nhimself acquainted with every incident that had happened in Vauxhall\nWalk.\n\nThe conclusions which the captain drew, after gaining his information,\nwere clear and easily stated.\n\nOn the adverse side of the question, he expressed his conviction that\nMrs. Lecount had certainly detected her visitor to be disguised; that\nshe had never really left the room, though she might have opened and\nshut the door; and that on both the occasions, therefore, when Magdalen\nhad been betrayed into speaking in her own voice, Mrs. Lecount had heard\nher. On the favorable side of the question, he was perfectly satisfied\nthat the painted face and eyelids, the wig, and the padded cloak had\nso effectually concealed Magdalen's identity, that she might in her own\nperson defy the housekeeper's closest scrutiny, so far as the matter\nof appearance was concerned. The difficulty of deceiving Mrs. Lecount's\nears, as well as her eyes, was, he readily admitted, not so easily to\nbe disposed of. But looking to the fact that Magdalen, on both the\noccasions when she had forgotten herself, had spoken in the heat of\nanger, he was of opinion that her voice had every reasonable chance of\nescaping detection, if she carefully avoided all outbursts of temper for\nthe future, and spoke in those more composed and ordinary tones which\nMrs. Lecount had not yet heard. Upon the whole, the captain was inclined\nto pronounce the prospect hopeful, if one serious obstacle were cleared\naway at the outset--that obstacle being nothing less than the presence\non the scene of action of Mrs. Wragge.\n\nTo Magdalen's surprise, when the course of her narrative brought her to\nthe story of the ghost, Captain Wragge listened with the air of a man\nwho was more annoyed than amused by what he heard. When she had done,\nhe plainly told her that her unlucky meeting on the stairs of the\nlodging-house with Mrs. Wragge was, in his opinion, the most serious of\nall the accidents that had happened in Vauxhall Walk.\n\n\"I can deal with the difficulty of my wife's stupidity,\" he said, \"as\nI have often dealt with it before. I can hammer her new identity _into_\nher head, but I can't hammer the ghost _out_ of it. We have no security\nthat the woman in the gray cloak and poke bonnet may not come back to\nher recollection at the most critical time, and under the most awkward\ncircumstances. In plain English, my dear girl, Mrs. Wragge is a pitfall\nunder our feet at every step we take.\"\n\n\"If we are aware of the pitfall,\" said Magdalen, \"we can take our\nmeasures for avoiding it. What do you propose?\"\n\n\"I propose,\" replied the captain, \"the temporary removal of Mrs. Wragge.\nSpeaking purely in a pecuniary point of view, I can't afford a total\nseparation from her. You have often read of very poor people being\nsuddenly enriched by legacies reaching them from remote and unexpected\nquarters? Mrs. Wragge's case, when I married her, was one of these. An\nelderly female relative shared the favors of fortune on that occasion\nwith my wife; and if I only keep up domestic appearances, I happen to\nknow that Mrs. Wragge will prove a second time profitable to me on that\nelderly relative's death. But for this circumstance, I should probably\nlong since have transferred my wife to the care of society at large--in\nthe agreeable conviction that if I didn't support her, somebody else\nwould. Although I can't afford to take this course, I see no objection\nto having her comfortably boarded and lodged out of our way for the\ntime being--say, at a retired farm-house, in the character of a lady in\ninfirm mental health. _You_ would find the expense trifling; _I_ should\nfind the relief unutterable. What do you say? Shall I pack her up at\nonce, and take her away by the next coach?\"\n\n\"No!\" replied Magdalen, firmly. \"The poor creature's life is hard enough\nalready; I won't help to make it harder. She was affectionately and\ntruly kind to me when I was ill, and I won't allow her to be shut up\namong strangers while I can help it. The risk of keeping her here is\nonly one risk more. I will face it, Captain Wragge, if you won't.\"\n\n\"Think twice,\" said the captain, gravely, \"before you decide on keeping\nMrs. Wragge.\"\n\n\"Once is enough,\" rejoined Magdalen. \"I won't have her sent away.\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the captain, resignedly. \"I never interfere with\nquestions of sentiment. But I have a word to say on my own behalf. If\nmy services are to be of any use to you, I can't have my hands tied\nat starting. This is serious. I won't trust my wife and Mrs. Lecount\ntogether. I'm afraid, if you're not, and I make it a condition that,\nif Mrs. Wragge stops here, she keeps her room. If you think her health\nrequires it, you can take her for a walk early in the morning, or late\nin the evening; but you must never trust her out with the servant, and\nnever trust her out by herself. I put the matter plainly, it is too\nimportant to be trifled with. What do you say--yes or no?\"\n\n\"I say yes,\" replied Magdalen, after a moment's consideration. \"On the\nunderstanding that I am to take her out walking, as you propose.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge bowed, and recovered his suavity of manner. \"What are our\nplans?\" he inquired. \"Shall we start our enterprise this afternoon? Are\nyou ready for your introduction to Mrs. Lecount and her master?\"\n\n\"Quite ready.\"\n\n\"Good again. We will meet them on the Parade, at their usual hour for\ngoing out--two o'clock. It is not twelve yet. I have two hours before\nme--just time enough to fit my wife into her new Skin. The process is\nabsolutely necessary, to prevent her compromising us with the servant.\nDon't be afraid about the results; Mrs. Wragge has had a copious\nselection of assumed names hammered into her head in the course of\nher matrimonial career. It is merely a question of hammering hard\nenough--nothing more. I think we have settled everything now. Is there\nanything I can do before two o'clock? Have you any employment for the\nmorning?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Magdalen. \"I shall go back to my own room, and try to rest.\"\n\n\"You had a disturbed night, I am afraid?\" said the captain, politely\nopening the door for her.\n\n\"I fell asleep once or twice,\" she answered, carelessly. \"I suppose my\nnerves are a little shaken. The bold black eyes of that man who stared\nso rudely at me yesterday evening seemed to be looking at me again in\nmy dreams. If we see him to-day, and if he annoys me any more, I must\ntrouble you to speak to him. We will meet here again at two o'clock.\nDon't be hard with Mrs. Wragge; teach her what she must learn as\ntenderly as you can.\"\n\nWith those words she left him, and went upstairs.\n\nShe lay down on her bed with a heavy sigh, and tried to sleep. It was\nuseless. The dull weariness of herself which now possessed her was not\nthe weariness which finds its remedy in repose. She rose again and sat\nby the window, looking out listlessly over the sea.\n\nA weaker nature than hers would not have felt the shock of Frank's\ndesertion as she had felt it--as she was feeling it still. A weaker\nnature would have found refuge in indignation and comfort in tears. The\npassionate strength of Magdalen's love clung desperately to the sinking\nwreck of its own delusion-clung, until she tore herself from it, by\nplain force of will. All that her native pride, her keen sense of wrong\ncould do, was to shame her from dwelling on the thoughts which still\ncaught their breath of life from the undying devotion of the past; which\nstill perversely ascribed Frank's heartless farewell to any cause but\nthe inborn baseness of the man who had written it. The woman never lived\nyet who could cast a true-love out of her heart because the object of\nthat love was unworthy of her. All she can do is to struggle against it\nin secret--to sink in the contest if she is weak; to win her way through\nit if she is strong, by a process of self-laceration which is, of all\nmoral remedies applied to a woman's nature, the most dangerous and the\nmost desperate; of all moral changes, the change that is surest to mark\nher for life. Magdalen's strong nature had sustained her through the\nstruggle; and the issue of it had left her what she now was.\n\nAfter sitting by the window for nearly an hour, her eyes looking\nmechanically at the view, her mind empty of all impressions, and\nconscious of no thoughts, she shook off the strange waking stupor that\npossessed her, and rose to prepare herself for the serious business of\nthe day.\n\nShe went to the wardrobe and took down from the pegs two bright,\ndelicate muslin dresses, which had been made for summer wear at\nCombe-Raven a year since, and which had been of too little value to be\nworth selling when she parted with her other possessions. After placing\nthese dresses side by side on the bed, she looked into the wardrobe once\nmore. It only contained one other summer dress--the plain alpaca gown\nwhich she had worn during her memorable interview with Noel Vanstone and\nMrs. Lecount. This she left in its place, resolving not to wear it--less\nfrom any dread that the housekeeper might recognize a pattern too quiet\nto be noticed, and too common to be remembered, than from the conviction\nthat it was neither gay enough nor becoming enough for her purpose.\nAfter taking a plain white muslin scarf, a pair of light gray kid\ngloves, and a garden-hat of Tuscan straw, from the drawers of the\nwardrobe, she locked it, and put the key carefully in her pocket.\n\nInstead of at once proceeding to dress herself, she sat idly looking at\nthe two muslin gowns; careless which she wore, and yet inconsistently\nhesitating which to choose. \"What does it matter!\" she said to herself,\nwith a reckless laugh; \"I am equally worthless in my own estimation,\nwhichever I put on.\" She shuddered, as if the sound of her own laughter\nhad startled her, and abruptly caught up the dress which lay nearest to\nher hand. Its colors were blue and white--the shade of blue which best\nsuited her fair complexion. She hurriedly put on the gown, without going\nnear her looking-glass. For the first time in her life she shrank\nfrom meeting the reflection of herself--except for a moment, when\nshe arranged her hair under her garden-hat, leaving the glass again\nimmediately. She drew her scarf over her shoulders and fitted on her\ngloves, with her back to the toilet-table. \"Shall I paint?\" she asked\nherself, feeling instinctively that she was turning pale. \"The rouge\nis still left in my box. It can't make my face more false than it is\nalready.\" She looked round toward the glass, and again turned away from\nit. \"No!\" she said. \"I have Mrs. Lecount to face as well as her master.\nNo paint.\" After consulting her watch, she left the room and went\ndownstairs again. It wanted ten minutes only of two o'clock.\n\nCaptain Wragge was waiting for her in the parlor--respectable, in a\nfrock-coat, a stiff summer cravat, and a high white hat; specklessly\nand cheerfully rural, in a buff waistcoat, gray trousers, and gaiters\nto match. His collars were higher than ever, and he carried a brand-new\ncamp-stool in his hand. Any tradesman in England who had seen him at\nthat moment would have trusted him on the spot.\n\n\"Charming!\" said the captain, paternally surveying Magdalen when she\nentered the room. \"So fresh and cool! A little too pale, my dear, and a\ngreat deal too serious. Otherwise perfect. Try if you can smile.\"\n\n\"When the time comes for smiling,\" said Magdalen, bitterly, \"trust my\ndramatic training for any change of face that may be necessary. Where is\nMrs. Wragge?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Wragge has learned her lesson,\" replied the captain, \"and is\nrewarded by my permission to sit at work in her own room. I sanction\nher new fancy for dressmaking, because it is sure to absorb all her\nattention, and to keep her at home. There is no fear of her finishing\nthe Oriental Robe in a hurry, for there is no mistake in the process of\nmaking it which she is not certain to commit. She will sit incubating\nher gown--pardon the expression--like a hen over an addled egg. I assure\nyou, her new whim relieves me. Nothing could be more convenient, under\nexisting circumstances.\"\n\nHe strutted away to the window, looked out, and beckoned to Magdalen to\njoin him. \"There they are!\" he said, and pointed to the Parade.\n\nNoel Vanstone slowly walked by, as she looked, dressed in a complete\nsuit of old-fashioned nankeen. It was apparently one of the days when\nthe state of his health was at the worst. He leaned on Mrs. Lecount's\narm, and was protected from the sun by a light umbrella which she held\nover him. The housekeeper--dressed to perfection, as usual, in a quiet,\nlavender-colored summer gown, a black mantilla, an unassuming straw\nbonnet, and a crisp blue veil--escorted her invalid master with the\ntenderest attention; sometimes directing his notice respectfully to the\nvarious objects of the sea view; sometimes bending her head in graceful\nacknowledgment of the courtesy of passing strangers on the Parade, who\nstepped aside to let the invalid pass by. She produced a visible effect\namong the idlers on the beach. They looked after her with unanimous\ninterest, and exchanged confidential nods of approval which said, as\nplainly as words could have expressed it, \"A very domestic person! a\ntruly superior woman!\"\n\nCaptain Wragge's party-colored eyes followed Mrs. Lecount with a steady,\ndistrustful attention. \"Tough work for us _there_,\" he whispered in\nMagdalen's ear; \"tougher work than you think, before we turn that woman\nout of her place.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Magdalen, quietly. \"Wait and see.\"\n\nShe walked to the door. The captain followed her without making\nany further remark. \"I'll wait till you're married,\" he thought to\nhimself--\"not a moment longer, offer me what you may.\"\n\nAt the house door Magdalen addressed him again.\n\n\"We will go that way,\" she said, pointing southward, \"then turn, and\nmeet them as they come back.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge signified his approval of the arrangement, and followed\nMagdalen to the garden gate. As she opened it to pass through, her\nattention was attracted by a lady, with a nursery-maid and two little\nboys behind her, loitering on the path outside the garden wall. The lady\nstarted, looked eagerly, and smiled to herself as Magdalen came out.\nCuriosity had got the better of Kirke's sister, and she had come to\nAldborough for the express purpose of seeing Miss Bygrave.\n\nSomething in the shape of the lady's face, something in the expression\nof her dark eyes, reminded Magdalen of the merchant-captain whose\nuncontrolled admiration had annoyed her on the previous evening. She\ninstantly returned the stranger's scrutiny by a frowning, ungracious\nlook. The lady colored, paid the look back with interest, and slowly\nwalked on.\n\n\"A hard, bold, bad girl,\" thought Kirke's sister. \"What could Robert be\nthinking of to admire her? I am almost glad he is gone. I hope and trust\nhe will never set eyes on Miss Bygrave again.\"\n\n\"What boors the people are here!\" said Magdalen to Captain Wragge. \"That\nwoman was even ruder than the man last night. She is like him in the\nface. I wonder who she is?\"\n\n\"I'll find out directly,\" said the captain. \"We can't be too cautious\nabout strangers.\" He at once appealed to his friends, the boatmen.\nThey were close at hand, and Magdalen heard the questions and answers\nplainly.\n\n\"How are you all this morning?\" said Captain Wragge, in his easy jocular\nway. \"And how's the wind? Nor'-west and by west, is it? Very good. Who\nis that lady?\"\n\n\"That's Mrs. Strickland, sir.\"\n\n\"Ay! ay! The clergyman's wife and the captain's sister. Where's the\ncaptain to-day?\"\n\n\"On his way to London, I should think, sir. His ship sails for China at\nthe end of the week.\"\n\nChina! As that one word passed the man's lips, a pang of the old sorrow\nstruck Magdalen to the heart. Stranger as he was, she began to hate the\nbare mention of the merchant-captain's name. He had troubled her dreams\nof the past night; and now, when she was most desperately and recklessly\nbent on forgetting her old home-existence, he had been indirectly the\ncause of recalling her mind to Frank.\n\n\"Come!\" she said, angrily, to her companion. \"What do we care about the\nman or his ship? Come away.\"\n\n\"By all means,\" said Captain Wragge. \"As long as we don't find friends\nof the Bygraves, what do we care about anybody?\"\n\nThey walked on southward for ten minutes or more, then turned and walked\nback again to meet Noel Vanstone and Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nCAPTAIN WRAGGE and Magdalen retraced their steps until they were again\nwithin view of North Shingles Villa before any signs appeared of Mrs.\nLecount and her master. At that point the housekeeper's lavender-colored\ndress, the umbrella, and the feeble little figure in nankeen walking\nunder it, became visible in the distance. The captain slackened his pace\nimmediately, and issued his directions to Magdalen for her conduct at\nthe coming interview in these words:\n\n\"Don't forget your smile,\" he said. \"In all other respects you will do.\nThe walk has improved your complexion, and the hat becomes you. Look\nMrs. Lecount steadily in the face; show no embarrassment when you speak;\nand if Mr. Noel Vanstone pays you pointed attention, don't take too much\nnotice of him while his housekeeper's eye is on you. Mind one thing!\nI have been at Joyce's Scientific Dialogues all the morning; and I am\nquite serious in meaning to give Mrs. Lecount the full benefit of my\nstudies. If I can't contrive to divert her attention from you and her\nmaster, I won't give sixpence for our chance of success. Small-talk\nwon't succeed with that woman; compliments won't succeed; jokes won't\nsucceed--ready-made science may recall the deceased professor, and\nready-made science may do. We must establish a code of signals to let\nyou know what I am about. Observe this camp-stool. When I shift it from\nmy left hand to my right, I am talking Joyce. When I shift it from my\nright hand to my left, I am talking Wragge. In the first case, don't\ninterrupt me--I am leading up to my point. In the second case, say\nanything you like; my remarks are not of the slightest consequence.\nWould you like a rehearsal? Are you sure you understand? Very good--take\nmy arm, and look happy. Steady! here they are.\"\n\nThe meeting took place nearly midway between Sea-view Cottage and North\nShingles. Captain Wragge took off his tall white hat and opened the\ninterview immediately on the friendliest terms.\n\n\"Good-morning, Mrs. Lecount,\" he said, with the frank and cheerful\npoliteness of a naturally sociable man. \"Good-morning, Mr. Vanstone;\nI am sorry to see you suffering to-day. Mrs. Lecount, permit me to\nintroduce my niece--my niece, Miss Bygrave. My dear girl, this is Mr.\nNoel Vanstone, our neighbor at Sea-view Cottage. We must positively\nbe sociable at Aldborough, Mrs. Lecount. There is only one walk in the\nplace (as my niece remarked to me just now, Mr. Vanstone); and on that\nwalk we must all meet every time we go out. And why not? Are we formal\npeople on either side? Nothing of the sort; we are just the reverse. You\npossess the Continental facility of manner, Mr. Vanstone--I match you\nwith the blunt cordiality of an old-fashioned Englishman--the ladies\nmingle together in harmonious variety, like flowers on the same bed--and\nthe result is a mutual interest in making our sojourn at the sea-side\nagreeable to each other. Pardon my flow of spirits; pardon my feeling\nso cheerful and so young. The Iodine in the sea-air, Mrs. Lecount--the\nnotorious effect of the Iodine in the sea-air!\"\n\n\"You arrived yesterday, Miss Bygrave, did you not?\" said the\nhousekeeper, as soon as the captain's deluge of language had come to an\nend.\n\nShe addressed those words to Magdalen with a gentle motherly interest\nin her youth and beauty, chastened by the deferential amiability which\nbecame her situation in Noel Vanstone's household. Not the faintest\ntoken of suspicion or surprise betrayed itself in her face, her voice,\nor her manner, while she and Magdalen now looked at each other. It was\nplain at the outset that the true face and figure which she now saw\nrecalled nothing to her mind of the false face and figure which she had\nseen in Vauxhall Walk. The disguise had evidently been complete enough\neven to baffle the penetration of Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"My aunt and I came here yesterday evening,\" said Magdalen. \"We found\nthe latter part of the journey very fatiguing. I dare say you found it\nso, too?\"\n\nShe designedly made her answer longer than was necessary for the purpose\nof discovering, at the earliest opportunity, the effect which the sound\nof her voice produced on Mrs. Lecount.\n\nThe housekeeper's thin lips maintained their motherly smile; the\nhousekeeper's amiable manner lost none of its modest deference, but the\nexpression of her eyes suddenly changed from a look of attention to a\nlook of inquiry. Magdalen quietly said a few words more, and then waited\nagain for results. The change spread gradually all over Mrs. Lecount's\nface, the motherly smile died away, and the amiable manner betrayed\na slight touch of restraint. Still no signs of positive recognition\nappeared; the housekeeper's expression remained what it had been from\nthe first--an expression of inquiry, and nothing more.\n\n\"You complained of fatigue, sir, a few minutes since,\" she said,\ndropping all further conversation with Magdalen and addressing her\nmaster. \"Will you go indoors and rest?\"\n\nThe proprietor of Sea-view Cottage had hitherto confined himself to\nbowing, simpering and admiring Magdalen through his half-closed eyelids.\nThere was no mistaking the sudden flutter and agitation in his manner,\nand the heightened color in his wizen little face. Even the reptile\ntemperament of Noel Vanstone warmed under the influence of the sex: he\nhad an undeniably appreciative eye for a handsome woman, and Magdalen's\ngrace and beauty were not thrown away on him.\n\n\"Will you go indoors, sir, and rest?\" asked the housekeeper, repeating\nher quest ion.\n\n\"Not yet, Lecount,\" said her master. \"I fancy I feel stronger; I fancy\nI can go on a little.\" He turned simpering to Magdalen, and added, in a\nlower tone: \"I have found a new interest in my walk, Miss Bygrave. Don't\ndesert us, or you will take the interest away with you.\"\n\nHe smiled and smirked in the highest approval of the ingenuity of his\nown compliment--from which Captain Wragge dexterously diverted the\nhousekeeper's attention by ranging himself on her side of the path and\nspeaking to her at the same moment. They all four walked on slowly. Mrs.\nLecount said nothing more. She kept fast hold of her master's arm, and\nlooked across him at Magdalen with the dangerous expression of inquiry\nmore marked than ever in her handsome black eyes. That look was not lost\non the wary Wragge. He shifted his indicative camp-stool from the left\nhand to the right, and opened his scientific batteries on the spot.\n\n\"A busy scene, Mrs. Lecount,\" said the captain, politely waving his\ncamp-stool over the sea and the passing ships. \"The greatness of\nEngland, ma'am--the true greatness of England. Pray observe how heavily\nsome of those vessels are laden! I am often inclined to wonder whether\nthe British sailor is at all aware, when he has got his cargo on board,\nof the Hydrostatic importance of the operation that he has performed.\nIf I were suddenly transported to the deck of one of those ships (which\nHeaven forbid, for I suffer at sea); and if I said to a member of the\ncrew: 'Jack! you have done wonders; you have grasped the Theory of\nFloating Vessels'--how the gallant fellow would stare! And yet on that\ntheory Jack's life depends. If he loads his vessel one-thirtieth part\nmore than he ought, what happens? He sails past Aldborough, I grant you,\nin safety. He enters the Thames, I grant you again, in safety. He gets\non into the fresh water as far, let us say, as Greenwich; and--down he\ngoes! Down, ma'am, to the bottom of the river, as a matter of scientific\ncertainty!\"\n\nHere he paused, and left Mrs. Lecount no polite alternative but to\nrequest an explanation.\n\n\"With infinite pleasure, ma'am,\" said the captain, drowning in the\ndeepest notes of his voice the feeble treble in which Noel Vanstone paid\nhis compliments to Magdalen. \"We will start, if you please, with a first\nprinciple. All bodies whatever that float on the surface of the water\ndisplace as much fluid as is equal in weight to the weight of the\nbodies. Good. We have got our first principle. What do we deduce from\nit? Manifestly this: That, in order to keep a vessel above water, it is\nnecessary to take care that the vessel and its cargo shall be of less\nweight than the weight of a quantity of water--pray follow me here!--of\na quantity of water equal in bulk to that part of the vessel which\nit will be safe to immerse in the water. Now, ma'am, salt-water is\nspecifically thirty times heavier than fresh or river water, and a\nvessel in the German Ocean will not sink so deep as a vessel in the\nThames. Consequently, when we load our ship with a view to the London\nmarket, we have (Hydrostatically speaking) three alternatives. Either we\nload with one-thirtieth part less than we can carry at sea; or we take\none-thirtieth part out at the mouth of the river; or we do neither\nthe one nor the other, and, as I have already had the honor of\nremarking--down we go! Such,\" said the captain, shifting the camp-stool\nback again from his right hand to his left, in token that Joyce was done\nwith for the time being; \"such, my dear madam, is the Theory of Floating\nVessels. Permit me to add, in conclusion, you are heartily welcome to\nit.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"You have unintentionally saddened\nme; but the information I have received is not the less precious on that\naccount. It is long, long ago, Mr. Bygrave, since I have heard myself\naddressed in the language of science. My dear husband made me his\ncompanion--my dear husband improved my mind as you have been trying to\nimprove it. Nobody has taken pains with my intellect since. Many thanks,\nsir. Your kind consideration for me is not thrown away.\"\n\nShe sighed with a plaintive humility, and privately opened her ears to\nthe conversation on the other side of her.\n\nA minute earlier she would have heard her master expressing himself in\nthe most flattering terms on the subject of Miss Bygrave's appearance in\nher sea-side costume. But Magdalen had seen Captain Wragge's signal with\nthe camp-stool, and had at once diverted Noel Vanstone to the topic of\nhimself and his possessions by a neatly-timed question about his house\nat Aldborough.\n\n\"I don't wish to alarm you, Miss Bygrave,\" were the first words of Noel\nVanstone's which caught Mrs. Lecount's attention, \"but there is only one\nsafe house in Aldborough, and that house is mine. The sea may destroy\nall the other houses--it can't destroy Mine. My father took care of\nthat; my father was a remarkable man. He had My house built on piles. I\nhave reason to believe they are the strongest piles in England. Nothing\ncan possibly knock them down--I don't care what the sea does--nothing\ncan possibly knock them down.\"\n\n\"Then, if the sea invades us,\" said Magdalen, \"we must all run for\nrefuge to you.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone saw his way to another compliment; and, at the same\nmoment, the wary captain saw his way to another burst of science.\n\n\"I could almost wish the invasion might happen,\" murmured one of the\ngentlemen, \"to give me the happiness of offering the refuge.\"\n\n\"I could almost swear the wind had shifted again!\" exclaimed the other.\n\"Where is a man I can ask? Oh, there he is. Boatman! How's the wind now?\nNor'west and by west still--hey? And southeast and by south yesterday\nevening--ha? Is there anything more remarkable, Mrs. Lecount, than\nthe variableness of the wind in this climate?\" proceeded the captain,\nshifting the camp-stool to the scientific side of him. \"Is there any\nnatural phenomenon more bewildering to the scientific inquirer? You\nwill tell me that the electric fluid which abounds in the air is\nthe principal cause of this variableness. You will remind me of the\nexperiment of that illustrious philosopher who measured the velocity of\na great storm by a flight of small feathers. My dear madam, I grant all\nyour propositions--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount; \"you kindly attribute to\nme a knowledge that I don't possess. Propositions, I regret to say, are\nquite beyond me.\"\n\n\"Don't misunderstand me, ma'am,\" continued the captain, politely\nunconscious of the interruption. \"My remarks apply to the temperate zone\nonly. Place me on the coasts beyond the tropics--place me where the wind\nblows toward the shore in the day-time, and toward the sea by night--and\nI instantly advance toward conclusive experiments. For example, I know\nthat the heat of the sun during the day rarefies the air over the land,\nand so causes the wind. You challenge me to prove it. I escort you down\nthe kitchen stairs (with your kind permission); take my largest pie-dish\nout of the cook's hands; I fill it with cold water. Good! that dish of\ncold water represents the ocean. I next provide myself with one of our\nmost precious domestic conveniences, a hot-water plate; I fill it with\nhot water and I put it in the middle of the pie-dish. Good again! the\nhot-water plate represents the land rarefying the air over it. Bear that\nin mind, and give me a lighted candle. I hold my lighted candle over the\ncold water, and blow it out. The smoke immediately moves from the dish\nto the plate. Before you have time to express your satisfaction, I\nlight the candle once more, and reverse the whole proceeding. I fill the\npie-dish with hot-water, and the plate with cold; I blow the candle out\nagain, and the smoke moves this time from the plate to the dish. The\nsmell is disagreeable--but the experiment is conclusive.\"\n\nHe shifted the camp-stool back again, and looked at Mrs. Lecount with\nhis ingratiating smile. \"You don't find me long-winded, ma'am--do\nyou?\" he said, in his easy, cheerful way, just as the housekeeper was\nprivately opening her ears once more to the conversation on the other\nside of her.\n\n\"I am amazed, sir, by the range of your information,\" replied Mrs.\nLecount, observing the captain with some perplexity--but thus far with\nno distrust. She thought him eccentric, even for an Englishman, and\npossibly a little vain of his knowledge. But he had at least paid her\nthe implied compliment of addressing that knowledge to herself; and she\nfelt it the more sensibly, from having hitherto found her scientific\nsympathies with her deceased husband treated with no great respect\nby the people with whom she came in contact. \"Have you extended your\ninquiries, sir,\" she proceeded, after a momentary hesitation, \"to my\nlate husband's branch of science? I merely ask, Mr. Bygrave, because\n(though I am only a woman) I think I might exchange ideas with you on\nthe subject of the reptile creation.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge was far too sharp to risk his ready-made science on the\nenemy's ground. The old militia-man shook his wary head.\n\n\"Too vast a subject, ma'am,\" he said, \"for a smatterer like me. The life\nand labors of such a philosopher as your husband, Mrs. Lecount, warn men\nof my intellectual caliber not to measure themselves with a giant. May\nI inquire,\" proceeded the captain, softly smoothing the way for future\nintercourse with Sea-view Cottage, \"whether you possess any scientific\nmemorials of the late Professor?\"\n\n\"I possess his Tank, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, modestly casting her eyes\non the ground, \"and one of his Subjects--a little foreign Toad.\"\n\n\"His Tank!\" exclaimed the captain, in tones of mournful interest; \"and\nhis Toad! Pardon my blunt way of speaking my mind, ma'am. You possess an\nobject of public interest; and, as one of the public, I acknowledge my\ncuriosity to see it.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount's smooth cheeks colored with pleasure. The one assailable\nplace in that cold and secret nature was the place occupied by the\nmemory of the Professor. Her pride in his scientific achievements,\nand her mortification at finding them but little known out of his own\ncountry, were genuine feelings. Never had Captain Wragge burned his\nadulterated incense on the flimsy altar of human vanity to better\npurpose than he was burning it now.\n\n\"You are very good, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"In honoring my husband's\nmemory, you honor me. But though you kindly treat me on a footing of\nequality, I must not forget that I fill a domestic situation. I shall\nfeel it a privilege to show you my relics, if you will allow me to ask\nmy master's permission first.\"\n\nShe turned to Noel Vanstone; her perfectly sincere intention of making\nthe proposed request, mingling--in that strange complexity of motives\nwhich is found so much oftener in a woman's mind than in a man's--with\nher jealous distrust of the impression which Magdalen had produced on\nher master.\n\n\"May I make a request, sir?\" asked Mrs. Lecount, after waiting a moment\nto catch any fragments of tenderly-personal talk that might reach\nher, and after being again neatly baffled by Magdalen--thanks to\nthe camp-stool. \"Mr. Bygrave is one of the few persons in England who\nappreciate my husband's scientific labors. He honors me by wishing to\nsee my little world of reptiles. May I show it to him?\"\n\n\"By all means, Lecount,\" said Noel Vanstone, graciously. \"You are\nan excellent creature, and I like to oblige you. Lecount's Tank, Mr.\nBygrave, is the only Tank in England--Lecount's Toad is the oldest Toad\nin the world. Will you come and drink tea at seven o'clock to-night? And\nwill you prevail on Miss Bygrave to accompany you? I want her to see my\nhouse. I don't think she has any idea what a strong house it is. Come\nand survey my premises, Miss Bygrave. You shall have a stick and rap on\nthe walls; you shall go upstairs and stamp on the floors, and then you\nshall hear what it all cost.\" His eyes wrinkled up cunningly at the\ncorners, and he slipped another tender speech into Magdalen's ear, under\ncover of the all-predominating voice in which Captain Wragge thanked him\nfor the invitation. \"Come punctually at seven,\" he whispered, \"and pray\nwear that charming hat!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount's lips closed ominously. She set down the captain's niece\nas a very serious drawback to the intellectual luxury of the captain's\nsociety.\n\n\"You are fatiguing yourself, sir,\" she said to her master. \"This is one\nof your bad days. Let me recommend you to be careful; let me beg you to\nwalk back.\"\n\nHaving carried his point by inviting the new acquaintances to tea, Noel\nVanstone proved to be unexpectedly docile. He acknowledged that he was\na little fatigued, and turned back at once in obedience to the\nhousekeeper's advice.\n\n\"Take my arm, sir--take my arm on the other side,\" said Captain Wragge,\nas they turned to retrace their steps. His party-colored eyes looked\nsignificantly at Magdalen while he spoke, and warned her not to stretch\nMrs. Lecount's endurance too far at starting. She instantly understood\nhim; and, in spite of Noel Vanstone's reiterated assertions that he\nstood in no need of the captain's arm, placed herself at once by the\nhousekeeper's side. Mrs. Lecount recovered her good-humor, and opened\nanother conversation with Magdalen by making the one inquiry of all\nothers which, under existing circumstances, was the hardest to answer.\n\n\"I presume Mrs. Bygrave is too tired, after her journey, to come out\nto-day?\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"Shall we have the pleasure of seeing her\ntomorrow?\"\n\n\"Probably not,\" replied Magdalen. \"My aunt is in delicate health.\"\n\n\"A complicated case, my dear madam,\" added the captain; conscious\nthat Mrs. Wragge's personal appearance (if she happened to be seen by\naccident) would offer the flattest of all possible contradictions\nto what Magdalen had just said of her. \"There is some remote nervous\nmischief which doesn't express itself externally. You would think my\nwife the picture of health if you looked at her, and yet, so delusive\nare appearances, I am obliged to forbid her all excitement. She sees no\nsociety--our medical attendant, I regret to say, absolutely prohibits\nit.\"\n\n\"Very sad,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"The poor lady must often feel lonely,\nsir, when you and your niece are away from her?\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the captain. \"Mrs. Bygrave is a naturally domestic woman.\nWhen she is able to employ herself, she finds unlimited resources in her\nneedle and thread.\" Having reached this stage of the explanation, and\nhaving purposely skirted, as it were, round the confines of truth, in\nthe event of the housekeeper's curiosity leading her to make any private\ninquiries on the subject of Mrs. Wragge, the captain wisely checked his\nfluent tongue from carrying him into any further details. \"I have great\nhope from the air of this place,\" he remarked, in conclusion. \"The\nIodine, as I have already observed, does wonders.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount acknowledged the virtues of Iodine, in the briefest\npossible form of words, and withdrew into the innermost sanctuary of her\nown thoughts. \"Some mystery here,\" said the housekeeper to herself.\n\"A lady who looks the picture of health; a lady who suffers from a\ncomplicated nervous malady; and a lady whose hand is steady enough to\nuse her needle and thread--is a living mass of contradictions I don't\nquite understand. Do you make a long stay at Aldborough, sir?\" she\nadded aloud, her eyes resting for a moment, in steady scrutiny, on the\ncaptain's face.\n\n\"It all depends, my dear madam, on Mrs. Bygrave. I trust we shall stay\nthrough the autumn. You are settled at Sea-view Cottage, I presume, for\nthe season?\"\n\n\"You must ask my master, sir. It is for him to decide, not for me.\"\n\nThe answer was an unfortunate one. Noel Vanstone had been secretly\nannoyed by the change in the walking arrangements, which had separated\nhim from Magdalen. He attributed that change to the meddling influence\nof Mrs. Lecount, and he now took the earliest opportunity of resenting\nit on the spot.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with our stay at Aldborough,\" he broke out,\npeevishly. \"You know as well as I do, Lecount, it all depends on _you_.\nMrs. Lecount has a brother in Switzerland,\" he went on, addressing\nhimself to the captain--\"a brother who is seriously ill. If he gets\nworse, she will have to go there to see him. I can't accompany her,\nand I can't be left in the house by myself. I shall have to break up my\nestablishment at Aldborough, and stay with some friends. It all depends\non you, Lecount--or on your brother, which comes to the same thing. If\nit depended on _me_,\" continued Mr. Noel Vanstone, looking pointedly\nat Magdalen across the housekeeper, \"I should stay at Aldborough\nall through the autumn with the greatest pleasure. With the greatest\npleasure,\" he reiterated, repeating the words with a tender look for\nMagdalen, and a spiteful accent for Mrs. Lecount.\n\nThus far Captain Wragge had remained silent; carefully noting in his\nmind the promising possibilities of a separation between Mrs. Lecount\nand her master which Noel Vanstone's little fretful outbreak had just\ndisclosed to him. An ominous trembling in the housekeeper's thin lips,\nas her master openly exposed her family affairs before strangers, and\nopenly set her jealously at defiance, now warned him to interfere. If\nthe misunderstanding were permitted to proceed to extremities, there was\na chance that the invitation for that evening to Sea-view Cottage might\nbe put off. Now, as ever, equal to the occasion, Captain Wragge called\nhis useful information once more to the rescue. Under the learned\nauspices of Joyce, he plunged, for the third time, into the ocean of\nscience, and brought up another pearl. He was still haranguing (on\nPneumatics this time), still improving Mrs. Lecount's mind with his\npolitest perseverance and his smoothest flow of language--when the\nwalking party stopped at Noel Vanstone's door.\n\n\"Bless my soul, here we are at your house, sir!\" said the captain,\ninterrupting himself in the middle of one of his graphic sentences. \"I\nwon't keep you standing a moment. Not a word of apology, Mrs. Lecount,\nI beg and pray! I will put that curious point in Pneumatics more clearly\nbefore you on a future occasion. In the meantime I need only repeat that\nyou can perform the experiment I have just mentioned to your own entire\nsatisfaction with a bladder, an exhausted receiver, and a square box. At\nseven o'clock this evening, sir--at seven o'clock, Mrs. Lecount. We have\nhad a remarkably pleasant walk, and a most instructive interchange of\nideas. Now, my dear girl, your aunt is waiting for us.\"\n\nWhile Mrs. Lecount stepped aside to open the garden gate, Noel Vanstone\nseized his opportunity and shot a last tender glance at Magdalen, under\nshelter of the umbrella, which he had taken into his own hands for\nthat express purpose. \"Don't forget,\" he said, with the sweetest smile;\n\"don't forget, when you come this evening, to wear that charming hat!\"\nBefore he could add any last words, Mrs. Lecount glided back to her\nplace, and the sheltering umbrella changed hands again immediately.\n\n\"An excellent morning's work!\" said Captain Wragge, as he and Magdalen\nwalked on together to North Shingles. \"You and I and Joyce have all\nthree done wonders. We have secured a friendly invitation at the first\nday's fishing for it.\"\n\nHe paused for an answer; and, receiving none, observed Magdalen more\nattentively than he had observed her yet. Her face had turned deadly\npale again; her eyes looked out mechanically straight before her in\nheedless, reckless despair.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked, with the greatest surprise. \"Are you\nill?\"\n\nShe made no reply; she hardly seemed to hear him.\n\n\"Are you getting alarmed about Mrs. Lecount?\" he inquired next. \"There\nis not the least reason for alarm. She may fancy she has heard something\nlike your voice before, but your face evidently bewilders her. Keep your\ntemper, and you keep her in the dark. Keep her in the dark, and you will\nput that two hundred pounds into my hands before the autumn is over.\"\n\nHe waited again for an answer, and again she remained silent. The\ncaptain tried for the third time in another direction.\n\n\"Did you get any letters this morning?\" he went on. \"Is there bad news\nagain from home? Any fresh difficulties with your sister?\"\n\n\"Say nothing about my sister!\" she broke out passionately. \"Neither you\nnor I are fit to speak of her.\"\n\nShe said those words at the garden-gate, and hurried into the house by\nherself. He followed her, and heard the door of her own room violently\nshut to, violently locked and double-locked. Solacing his indignation\nby an oath, Captain Wragge sullenly went into one of the parlors on\nthe ground-floor to look after his wife. The room communicated with a\nsmaller and darker room at the back of the house by means of a quaint\nlittle door with a window in the upper half of it. Softly approaching\nthis door, the captain lifted the white muslin curtain which hung over\nthe window, and looked into the inner room.\n\nThere was Mrs. Wragge, with her cap on one side, and her shoes down at\nheel; with a row of pins between her teeth; with the Oriental Cashmere\nRobe slowly slipping off the table; with her scissors suspended\nuncertain in one hand, and her written directions for dressmaking held\ndoubtfully in the other--so absorbed over the invincible difficulties\nof her employment as to be perfectly unconscious that she was at that\nmoment the object of her husband's superintending eye. Under other\ncircumstances she would have been soon brought to a sense of her\nsituation by the sound of his voice. But Captain Wragge was too anxious\nabout Magdalen to waste any time on his wife, after satisfying himself\nthat she was safe in her seclusion, and that she might be trusted to\nremain there.\n\nHe left the parlor, and, after a little hesitation in the passage, stole\nupstairs and listened anxiously outside Magdalen's door. A dull sound\nof sobbing--a sound stifled in her handkerchief, or stifled in the\nbed-clothes--was all that caught his ear. He returned at once to the\nground-floor, with some faint suspicion of the truth dawning on his mind\nat last.\n\n\"The devil take that sweetheart of hers!\" thought the captain. \"Mr. Noel\nVanstone has raised the ghost of him at starting.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nWHEN Magdalen appeared in the parlor shortly before seven o'clock, not a\ntrace of discomposure was visible in her manner. She looked and spoke as\nquietly and unconcernedly as usual.\n\nThe lowering distrust on Captain Wragge's face cleared away at the\nsight of her. There had been moments during the afternoon when he had\nseriously doubted whether the pleasure of satisfying the grudge he owed\nto Noel Vanstone, and the prospect of earning the sum of two hundred\npounds, would not be dearly purchased by running the risk of discovery\nto which Magdalen's uncertain temper might expose him at any hour of\nthe day. The plain proof now before him of her powers of self-control\nrelieved his mind of a serious anxiety. It mattered little to the\ncaptain what she suffered in the privacy of her own chamber, as long as\nshe came out of it with a face that would bear inspection, and a voice\nthat betrayed nothing.\n\nOn the way to Sea-view Cottage, Captain Wragge expressed his intention\nof asking the housekeeper a few sympathizing questions on the subject of\nher invalid brother in Switzerland. He was of opinion that the critical\ncondition of this gentleman's health might exercise an important\ninfluence on the future progress of the conspiracy. Any chance of a\nseparation, he remarked, between the housekeeper and her master was,\nunder existing circumstances, a chance which merited the closest\ninvestigation. \"If we can only get Mrs. Lecount out of the way at the\nright time,\" whispered the captain, as he opened his host's garden gate,\n\"our man is caught!\"\n\nIn a minute more Magdalen was again under Noel Vanstone's roof; this\ntime in the character of his own invited guest.\n\nThe proceedings of the evening were for the most part a repetition of\nthe proceedings during the morning walk. Noel Vanstone vibrated between\nhis admiration of Magdalen's beauty and his glorification of his\nown possessions. Captain Wragge's inexhaustible outbursts of\ninformation--relieved by delicately-indirect inquiries relating to\nMrs. Lecount's brother--perpetually diverted the housekeeper's jealous\nvigilance from dwelling on the looks and language of her master. So the\nevening passed until ten o'clock. By that time the captain's ready-made\nscience was exhausted, and the housekeeper's temper was forcing its way\nto the surface. Once more Captain Wragge warned Magdalen by a look,\nand, in spite of Noel Vanstone's hospitable protest, wisely rose to say\ngood-night.\n\n\"I have got my information,\" remarked the captain on the way back. \"Mrs.\nLecount's brother lives at Zurich. He is a bachelor; he possesses a\nlittle money, and his sister is his nearest relation. If he will only\nbe so obliging as to break up altogether, he will save us a world of\ntrouble with Mrs. Lecount.\"\n\nIt was a fine moonlight night. He looked round at Magdalen, as he said\nthose words, to see if her intractable depression of spirits had seized\non her again.\n\nNo! her variable humor had changed once more. She looked about her\nwith a flaunting, feverish gayety; she scoffed at the bare idea of\nany serious difficulty with Mrs. Lecount; she mimicked Noel Vanstone's\nhigh-pitched voice, and repeated Noel Vanstone's high-flown compliments,\nwith a bitter enjoyment of turning him into ridicule. Instead of running\ninto the house as before, she sauntered carelessly by her companion's\nside, humming little snatches of song, and kicking the loose pebbles\nright and left on the garden-walk. Captain Wragge hailed the change in\nher as the best of good omens. He thought he saw plain signs that the\nfamily spirit was at last coming back again.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, as he lit her bedroom candle for her, \"when we all meet\non the Parade tomorrow, we shall see, as our nautical friends say, how\nthe land lies. One thing I can tell you, my dear girl--I have used my\neyes to very little purpose if there is not a storm brewing tonight in\nMr. Noel Vanstone's domestic atmosphere.\"\n\nThe captain's habitual penetration had not misled him. As soon as the\ndoor of Sea-view Cottage was closed on the parting guests, Mrs. Lecount\nmade an effort to assert the authority which Magdalen's influence was\nthreatening already.\n\nShe employed every artifice of which she was mistress to ascertain\nMagdalen's true position in Noel Vanstone's estimation. She tried again\nand again to lure him into an unconscious confession of the pleasure\nwhich he felt already in the society of the beautiful Miss Bygrave; she\ntwined herself in and out of every weakness in his character, as the\nfrogs and efts twined themselves in and out of the rock-work of her\nAquarium. But she made one serious mistake which very clever people\nin their intercourse with their intellectual inferiors are almost\nuniversally apt to commit--she trusted implicitly to the folly of a\nfool. She forgot that one of the lowest of human qualities--cunning--is\nexactly the capacity which is often most largely developed in the lowest\nof intellectual natures. If she had been honestly angry with her master,\nshe would probably have frightened him. If she had opened her mind\nplainly to his view, she would have astonished him by presenting a chain\nof ideas to his limited perceptions which they were not strong enough to\ngrasp; his curiosity would have led him to ask for an explanation; and\nby practicing on that curiosity, she might have had him at her mercy. As\nit was, she set her cunning against his, and the fool proved a match for\nher. Noel Vanstone, to whom all large-minded motives under heaven were\ninscrutable mysteries, saw the small-minded motive at the bottom of his\nhousekeeper's conduct with as instantaneous a penetration as if he had\nbeen a man of the highest ability. Mrs. Lecount left him for the night,\nfoiled, and knowing she was foiled--left him, with the tigerish side of\nher uppermost, and a low-lived longing in her elegant finger-nails to\nset them in her master's face.\n\nShe was not a woman to be beaten by one defeat or by a hundred. She was\npositively determined to think, and think again, until she had found\na means of checking the growing intimacy with the Bygraves at once and\nforever. In the solitude of her own room she recovered her composure,\nand set herself for the first time to review the conclusions which she\nhad gathered from the events of the day.\n\nThere was something vaguely familiar to her in the voice of this\nMiss Bygrave, and, at the same time, in unaccountable contradiction,\nsomething strange to her as well. The face and figure of the young lady\nwere entirely new to her. It was a striking face, and a striking figure;\nand if she had seen either at any former period, she would certainly\nhave remembered it. Miss Bygrave was unquestionably a stranger; and\nyet--\n\nShe had got no further than this during the day; she could get no\nfurther now: the chain of thought broke. Her mind took up the fragments,\nand formed another chain which attached itself to the lady who was kept\nin seclusion--to the aunt, who looked well, and yet was nervous; who was\nnervous, and yet able to ply her needle and thread. An incomprehensible\nresemblance to some unremembered voice in the niece; an unintelligible\nmalady which kept the aunt secluded from public view; an extraordinary\nrange of scientific cultivation in the uncle, associated with a\ncoarseness and audacity of manner which by no means suggested the idea\nof a man engaged in studious pursuits--were the members of this small\nfamily of three what they seemed on the surface of them?\n\nWith that question on her mind, she went to bed.\n\nAs soon as the candle was out, the darkness seemed to communicate some\ninexplicable perversity to her thoughts. They wandered back from present\nthings to past, in spite of her. They brought her old master back to\nlife again; they revived forgotten sayings and doings in the English\ncircle at Zurich; they veered away to the old man's death-bed at\nBrighton; they moved from Brighton to London; they entered the bare,\ncomfortless room at Vauxhall Walk; they set the Aquarium back in its\nplace on the kitchen table, and put the false Miss Garth in the chair\nby the side of it, shading her inflamed eyes from the light; they placed\nthe anonymous letter, the letter which glanced darkly at a conspiracy,\nin her hand again, and brought her with it into her master's presence;\nthey recalled the discussion about filling in the blank space in the\nadvertisement, and the quarrel that followed when she told Noel Vanstone\nthat the sum he had offered was preposterously small; they revived an\nold doubt which had not troubled her for weeks past--a doubt whether the\nthreatened conspiracy had evaporated in mere words, or whether she and\nher master were likely to hear of it again. At this point her thoughts\nbroke off once more, and there was a momentary blank. The next instant\nshe started up in bed; her heart beating violently, her head whirling\nas if she had lost her senses. With electric suddenness her mind pieced\ntogether its scattered multitude of thoughts, and put them before her\nplainly under one intelligible form. In the all-mastering agitation of\nthe moment, she clapped her hands together, and cried out suddenly in\nthe darkness:\n\n\"Miss Vanstone again!!!\"\n\nShe got out of bed and kindled the light once more. Steady as her nerves\nwere, the shock of her own suspicion had shaken them. Her firm hand\ntrembled as she opened her dressing-case and took from it a little\nbottle of sal-volatile. In spite of her smooth cheeks and her\nwell-preserved hair, she looked every year of her age as she mixed the\nspirit with water, greedily drank it, and, wrapping her dressing-gown\nround her, sat down on the bedside to get possession again of her calmer\nself.\n\nShe was quite incapable of tracing the mental process which had led her\nto discovery. She could not get sufficiently far from herself to see\nthat her half-formed conclusions on the subject of the Bygraves had\nended in making that family objects of suspicion to her; that the\nassociation of ideas had thereupon carried her mind back to that other\nobject of suspicion which was represented by the conspiracy against\nher master; and that the two ideas of those two separate subjects of\ndistrust, coming suddenly in contact, had struck the light. She was not\nable to reason back in this way from the effect to the cause. She could\nonly feel that the suspicion had become more than a suspicion already:\nconviction itself could not have been more firmly rooted in her mind.\n\nLooking back at Magdalen by the new light now thrown on her, Mrs.\nLecount would fain have persuaded herself that she recognized some\ntraces left of the false Miss Garth's face and figure in the graceful\nand beautiful girl who had sat at her master's table hardly an hour\nsince--that she found resemblances now, which she had never thought of\nbefore, between the angry voice she had heard in Vauxhall Walk and the\nsmooth, well-bred tones which still hung on her ears after the evening's\nexperience downstairs. She would fain have persuaded herself that she\nhad reached these results with no undue straining of the truth as she\nreally knew it, but the effort was in vain.\n\nMrs. Lecount was not a woman to waste time and thought in trying to\nimpose on herself. She accepted the inevitable conclusion that the\nguesswork of a moment had led her to discovery. And, more than that, she\nrecognized the plain truth--unwelcome as it was--that the conviction now\nfixed in her own mind was thus far unsupported by a single fragment of\nproducible evidence to justify it to the minds of others.\n\nUnder these circumstances, what was the safe course to take with her\nmaster?\n\nIf she candidly told him, when they met the next morning, what had\npassed through her mind that night, her knowledge of Noel Vanstone\nwarned her that one of two results would certainly happen. Either he\nwould be angry and disputatious; would ask for proofs; and, finding none\nforthcoming, would accuse her of alarming him without a cause, to serve\nher own jealous end of keeping Magdalen out of the house; or he would\nbe seriously startled, would clamor for the protection of the law, and\nwould warn the Bygraves to stand on their defense at the outset. If\nMagdalen only had been concerned in the plot this latter consequence\nwould have assumed no great importance in the housekeeper's mind. But\nseeing the deception as she now saw it, she was far too clever a woman\nto fail in estimating the captain's inexhaustible fertility of resource\nat its true value. \"If I can't meet this impudent villain with plain\nproofs to help me,\" thought Mrs. Lecount, \"I may open my master's eyes\nto-morrow morning, and Mr. Bygrave will shut them up again before night.\nThe rascal is playing with all his own cards under the table, and he\nwill win the game to a certainty, if he sees my hand at starting.\"\n\nThis policy of waiting was so manifestly the wise policy--the wily Mr.\nBygrave was so sure to have provided himself, in case of emergency, with\nevidence to prove the identity which he and his niece had assumed for\ntheir purpose--that Mrs. Lecount at once decided to keep her own counsel\nthe next morning, and to pause before attacking the conspiracy until she\ncould produce unanswerable facts to help her. Her master's acquaintance\nwith the Bygraves was only an acquaintance of one day's standing. There\nwas no fear of its developing into a dangerous intimacy if she merely\nallowed it to continue for a few days more, and if she permanently\nchecked it, at the latest, in a week's time.\n\nIn that period what measures could she take to remove the obstacles\nwhich now stood in her way, and to provide herself with the weapons\nwhich she now wanted?\n\nReflection showed her three different chances in her favor--three\ndifferent ways of arriving at the necessary discovery.\n\nThe first chance was to cultivate friendly terms with Magdalen, and\nthen, taking her unawares, to entrap her into betraying herself in Noel\nVanstone's presence. The second chance was to write to the elder\nMiss Vanstone, and to ask (with some alarming reason for putting\nthe question) for information on the subject of her younger sister's\nwhereabouts, and of any peculiarities in her personal appearance\nwhich might enable a stranger to identify her. The third chance was to\npenetrate the mystery of Mrs. Bygrave's seclusion, and to ascertain at\na personal interview whether the invalid lady's real complaint might\nnot possibly be a defective capacity for keeping her husband's secrets.\nResolving to try all three chances, in the order in which they are here\nenumerated, and to set her snares for Magdalen on the day that was now\nalready at hand, Mrs. Lecount at last took off her dressing-gown and\nallowed her weaker nature to plead with her for a little sleep.\n\nThe dawn was breaking over the cold gray sea as she lay down in her\nbed again. The last idea in her mind before she fell asleep was\ncharacteristic of the woman--it was an idea that threatened the captain.\n\"He has trifled with the sacred memory of my husband,\" thought the\nProfessor's widow. \"On my life and honor, I will make him pay for it.\"\n\n\nEarly the next morning Magdalen began the day, according to her\nagreement with the captain, by taking Mrs. Wragge out for a little\nexercise at an hour when there was no fear of her attracting the public\nattention. She pleaded hard to be left at home; having the Oriental\nCashmere Robe still on her mind, and feeling it necessary to read her\ndirections for dressmaking, for the hundredth time at least, before\n(to use her own expression) she could \"screw up her courage to put the\nscissors into the stuff.\" But her companion would take no denial, and\nshe was forced to go out. The one guileless purpose of the life which\nMagdalen now led was the resolution that poor Mrs. Wragge should not be\nmade a prisoner on her account; and to that resolution she mechanically\nclung, as the last token left her by which she knew her better-self.\n\nThey returned later than usual to breakfast. While Mrs. Wragge was\nupstairs, straightening herself from head to foot to meet the morning\ninspection of her husband's orderly eye; and while Magdalen and the\ncaptain were waiting for her in the parlor, the servant came in with a\nnote from Sea-view Cottage. The messenger was waiting for an answer, and\nthe note was addressed to Captain Wragge.\n\nThe captain opened the note and read these lines:\n\n\n\"DEAR SIR--Mr. Noel Vanstone desires me to write and tell you that he\nproposes enjoying this fine day by taking a long drive to a place on the\ncoast here called Dunwich. He is anxious to know if you will share the\nexpense of a carriage, and give him the pleasure of your company and\nMiss Bygrave's company on this excursion. I am kindly permitted to\nbe one of the party; and if I may say so without impropriety, I would\nventure to add that I shall feel as much pleasure as my master if\nyou and your young lady will consent to join us. We propose leaving\nAldborough punctually at eleven o'clock. Believe me, dear sir, your\nhumble servant,\n\n\"VIRGINIE LECOUNT.\"\n\n\n\"Who is the letter from?\" asked Magdalen, noticing a change in Captain\nWragge's face as he read it. \"What do they want with us at Sea-view\nCottage?\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" said the captain, gravely, \"this requires consideration.\nLet me have a minute or two to think.\"\n\nHe took a few turns up and down the room, then suddenly stepped aside to\na table in a corner on which his writing materials were placed. \"I\nwas not born yesterday, ma'am!\" said the captain, speaking jocosely to\nhimself. He winked his brown eye, took up his pen, and wrote the answer.\n\n\"Can you speak now?\" inquired Magdalen, when the servant had left the\nroom. \"What does that letter say, and how have you answered it?\"\n\nThe captain placed the letter in her hand. \"I have accepted the\ninvitation,\" he replied, quietly.\n\nMagdalen read the letter. \"Hidden enmity yesterday,\" she said, \"and open\nfriendship to-day. What does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means,\" said Captain Wragge, \"that Mrs. Lecount is even sharper than\nI thought her. She has found you out.\"\n\n\"Impossible,\" cried Magdalen. \"Quite impossible in the time.\"\n\n\"I can't say _how_ she has found you out,\" proceeded the captain, with\nperfect composure. \"She may know more of your voice than we supposed\nshe knew. Or she may have thought us, on reflection, rather a suspicious\nfamily; and anything suspicious in which a woman was concerned may have\ntaken her mind back to that morning call of yours in Vauxhall Walk.\nWhichever way it may be, the meaning of this sudden change is clear\nenough. She has found you out; and she wants to put her discovery to the\nproof by slipping in an awkward question or two, under cover of a little\nfriendly talk. My experience of humanity has been a varied one, and\nMrs. Lecount is not the first sharp practitioner in petticoats whom I\nhave had to deal with. All the world's a stage, my dear girl, and one of\nthe scenes on our little stage is shut in from this moment.\"\n\nWith those words he took his copy of Joyce's Scientific Dialogues out\nof his pocket. \"You're done with already, my friend!\" said the captain,\ngiving his useful information a farewell smack with his hand, and\nlocking it up in the cupboard. \"Such is human popularity!\" continued\nthe indomitable vagabond, putting the key cheerfully in his pocket.\n\"Yesterday Joyce was my all-in-all. To-day I don't care that for him!\"\nHe snapped his fingers and sat down to breakfast.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" said Magdalen, looking at him angrily. \"Are\nyou leaving me to my own resources for the future?\"\n\n\"My dear girl!\" cried Captain Wragge, \"can't you accustom yourself to my\ndash of humor yet? I have done with my ready-made science simply because\nI am quite sure that Mrs. Lecount has done believing in me. Haven't I\naccepted the invitation to Dunwich? Make your mind easy. The help I have\ngiven you already counts for nothing compared with the help I am going\nto give you now. My honor is concerned in bowling out Mrs. Lecount. This\nlast move of hers has made it a personal matter between us. _The woman\nactually thinks she can take me in!!!_\" cried the captain, striking his\nknife-handle on the table in a transport of virtuous indignation. \"By\nheavens, I never was so insulted before in my life! Draw your chair in\nto the table, my dear, and give me half a minute's attention to what I\nhave to say next.\"\n\nMagdalen obeyed him. Captain Wragge cautiously lowered his voice before\nhe went on.\n\n\"I have told you all along,\" he said, \"the one thing needful is never to\nlet Mrs. Lecount catch you with your wits wool-gathering. I say the same\nafter what has happened this morning. Let her suspect you! I defy her to\nfind a fragment of foundation for her suspicions, unless we help her. We\nshall see to-day if she has been foolish enough to betray herself to her\nmaster before she has any facts to support her. I doubt it. If she has\ntold him, we will rain down proofs of our identity with the Bygraves\non his feeble little head till it absolutely aches with conviction. You\nhave two things to do on this excursion. First, to distrust every word\nMrs. Lecount says to you. Secondly, to exert all your fascinations, and\nmake sure of Mr. Noel Vanstone, dating from to-day. I will give you the\nopportunity when we leave the carriage and take our walk at Dunwich.\nWear your hat, wear your smile; do your figure justice, lace tight; put\non your neatest boots and brightest gloves; tie the miserable little\nwretch to your apron-string--tie him fast; and leave the whole\nmanagement of the matter after that to me. Steady! here is Mrs. Wragge:\nwe must be doubly careful in looking after her now. Show me your cap,\nMrs. Wragge! show me your shoes! What do I see on your apron? A spot? I\nwon't have spots! Take it off after breakfast, and put on another. Pull\nyour chair to the middle of the table--more to the left--more still.\nMake the breakfast.\"\n\nAt a quarter before eleven Mrs. Wragge (with her own entire concurrence)\nwas dismissed to the back room, to bewilder herself over the science of\ndressmaking for the rest of the day. Punctually as the clock struck\nthe hour, Mrs. Lecount and her master drove up to the gate of North\nShingles, and found Magdalen and Captain Wragge waiting for them in the\ngarden.\n\nOn the way to Dunwich nothing occurred to disturb the enjoyment of\nthe drive. Noel Vanstone was in excellent health and high good-humor.\nLecount had apologized for the little misunderstanding of the previous\nnight; Lecount had petitioned for the excursion as a treat to herself.\nHe thought of these concessions, and looked at Magdalen, and smirked\nand simpered without intermission. Mrs. Lecount acted her part to\nperfection. She was motherly with Magdalen and tenderly attentive\nto Noel Vanstone. She was deeply interested in Captain Wragge's\nconversation, and meekly disappointed to find it turn on general\nsubjects, to the exclusion of science. Not a word or look escaped her\nwhich hinted in the remotest degree at her real purpose. She was dressed\nwith her customary elegance and propriety; and she was the only one\nof the party on that sultry summer's day who was perfectly cool in the\nhottest part of the journey.\n\nAs they left the carriage on their arrival at Dunwich, the captain\nseized a moment when Mrs. Lecount's eye was off him and fortified\nMagdalen by a last warning word.\n\n\"'Ware the cat!\" he whispered. \"She will show her claws on the way\nback.\"\n\nThey left the village and walked to the ruins of a convent near at\nhand--the last relic of the once populous city of Dunwich which\nhas survived the destruction of the place, centuries since, by the\nall-devouring sea. After looking at the ruins, they sought the shade of\na little wood between the village and the low sand-hills which overlook\nthe German Ocean. Here Captain Wragge maneuvered so as to let Magdalen\nand Noel Vanstone advance some distance in front of Mrs. Lecount and\nhimself, took the wrong path, and immediately lost his way with the\nmost consummate dexterity. After a few minutes' wandering (in the wrong\ndirection), he reached an open space near the sea; and politely opening\nhis camp-stool for the housekeeper's accommodation, proposed waiting\nwhere they were until the missing members of the party came that way and\ndiscovered them.\n\nMrs. Lecount accepted the proposal. She was perfectly well aware that\nher escort had lost himself on purpose, but that discovery exercised no\ndisturbing influence on the smooth amiability of her manner. Her day of\nreckoning with the captain had not come yet--she merely added the new\nitem to her list, and availed herself of the camp-stool. Captain Wragge\nstretched himself in a romantic attitude at her feet, and the two\ndetermined enemies (grouped like two lovers in a picture) fell into as\neasy and pleasant a conversation as if they had been friends of twenty\nyears' standing.\n\n\"I know you, ma'am!\" thought the captain, while Mrs. Lecount was talking\nto him. \"You would like to catch me tripping in my ready-made science,\nand you wouldn't object to drown me in the Professor's Tank!\"\n\n\"You villain with the brown eye and the green!\" thought Mrs. Lecount, as\nthe captain caught the ball of conversation in his turn; \"thick as your\nskin is, I'll sting you through it yet!\"\n\nIn this frame of mind toward each other they talked fluently on general\nsubjects, on public affairs, on local scenery, on society in England\nand society in Switzerland, on health, climate, books, marriage\nand money--talked, without a moment's pause, without a single\nmisunderstanding on either side for nearly an hour, before Magdalen\nand Noel Vanstone strayed that way and made the party of four complete\nagain.\n\nWhen they reached the inn at which the carriage was waiting for them,\nCaptain Wragge left Mrs. Lecount in undisturbed possession of her\nmaster, and signed to Magdalen to drop back for a moment and speak to\nhim.\n\n\"Well?\" asked the captain, in a whisper, \"is he fast to your\napron-string?\"\n\nShe shuddered from head to foot as she answered.\n\n\"He has kissed my hand,\" she said. \"Does that tell you enough? Don't let\nhim sit next me on the way home! I have borne all I can bear--spare me\nfor the rest of the day.\"\n\n\"I'll put you on the front seat of the carriage,\" replied the captain,\n\"side by side with me.\"\n\nOn the journey back Mrs. Lecount verified Captain Wragge's prediction.\nShe showed her claws.\n\nThe time could not have been better chosen; the circumstances could\nhardly have favored her more. Magdalen's spirits were depressed: she was\nweary in body and mind; and she sat exactly opposite the housekeeper,\nwho had been compelled, by the new arrangement, to occupy the seat of\nhonor next her master. With every facility for observing the slightest\nchanges that passed over Magdalen's face, Mrs. Lecount tried her first\nexperiment by leading the conversation to the subject of London, and to\nthe relative advantages offered to residents by the various quarters\nof the metropolis on both sides of the river. The ever-ready Wragge\npenetrated her intention sooner than she had anticipated, and interposed\nimmediately. \"You're coming to Vauxhall Walk, ma'am,\" thought the\ncaptain; \"I'll get there before you.\"\n\nHe entered at once into a purely fictitious description of the various\nquarters of London in which he had himself resided; and, adroitly\nmentioning Vauxhall Walk as one of them, saved Magdalen from the sudden\nquestion relating to that very locality with which Mrs. Lecount had\nproposed startling her, to begin with. From his residences he passed\nsmoothly to himself, and poured his whole family history (in the\ncharacter of Mr. Bygrave) into the housekeeper's ears--not forgetting\nhis brother's grave in Honduras, with the monument by the self-taught\nnegro artist, and his brother's hugely corpulent widow, on the\nground-floor of the boarding-house at Cheltenham. As a means of giving\nMagdalen time to compose herself, this outburst of autobiographical\ninformation attained its object, but it answered no other purpose. Mrs.\nLecount listened, without being imposed on by a single word the captain\nsaid to her. He merely confirmed her conviction of the hopelessness of\ntaking Noel Vanstone into her confidence before she had facts to help\nher against Captain Wragge's otherwise unassailable position in the\nidentity which he had assumed. She quietly waited until he had done, and\nthen returned to the charge.\n\n\"It is a coincidence that your uncle should have once resided in\nVauxhall Walk,\" she said, addressing herself to Magdalen. \"Mr. Noel\nhas a house in the same place, and we lived there before we came to\nAldborough. May I inquire, Miss Bygrave, whether you know anything of a\nlady named Miss Garth?\"\n\nThis time she put the question before the captain could interfere.\nMagdalen ought to have been prepared for it by what had already passed\nin her presence, but her nerves had been shaken by the earlier events of\nthe day; and she could only answer the question in the negative, after\nan instant's preliminary pause to control herself. Her hesitation was\nof too momentary a nature to attract the attention of any unsuspicious\nperson. But it lasted long enough to confirm Mrs. Lecount's private\nconvictions, and to encourage her to advance a little further.\n\n\"I only asked,\" she continued, steadily fixing her eyes on Magdalen,\nsteadily disregarding the efforts which Captain Wragge made to join\nin the conversation, \"because Miss Garth is a stranger to me, and I am\ncurious to find out what I can about her. The day before we left town,\nMiss Bygrave, a person who presented herself under the name I have\nmentioned paid us a visit under very extraordinary circumstances.\"\n\nWith a smooth, ingratiating manner, with a refinement of contempt\nwhich was little less than devilish in its ingenious assumption of the\nlanguage of pity, she now boldly described Magdalen's appearance in\ndisguise in Magdalen's own presence. She slightingly referred to the\nmaster and mistress of Combe-Raven as persons who had always annoyed the\nelder and more respectable branch of the family; she mourned over the\nchildren as following their parents' example, and attempting to take\na mercenary advantage of Mr. Noel Vanstone, under the protection of a\nrespectable person's character and a respectable person's name. Cleverly\nincluding her master in the conversation, so as to prevent the\ncaptain from effecting a diversion in that quarter; sparing no petty\naggravation; striking at every tender place which the tongue of a\nspiteful woman can wound, she would, beyond all doubt, have carried her\npoint, and tortured Magdalen into openly betraying herself, if Captain\nWragge had not checked her in full career by a loud exclamation of\nalarm, and a sudden clutch at Magdalen's wrist.\n\n\"Ten thousand pardons, my dear madam!\" cried the captain. \"I see in\nmy niece's face, I feel in my niece's pulse, that one of her violent\nneuralgic attacks has come on again. My dear girl, why hesitate among\nfriends to confess that you are in pain? What mistimed politeness! Her\nface shows she is suffering--doesn't it Mrs. Lecount? Darting pains,\nMr. Vanstone, darting pains on the left side of the head. Pull down\nyour veil, my dear, and lean on me. Our friends will excuse you; our\nexcellent friends will excuse you for the rest of the day.\"\n\nBefore Mrs. Lecount could throw an instant's doubt on the genuineness\nof the neuralgic attack, her master's fidgety sympathy declared\nitself exactly as the captain had anticipated, in the most active\nmanifestations. He stopped the carriage, and insisted on an immediate\nchange in the arrangement of the places--the comfortable back seat for\nMiss Bygrave and her uncle, the front seat for Lecount and himself. Had\nLecount got her smelling-bottle? Excellent creature! let her give it\ndirectly to Miss Bygrave, and let the coachman drive carefully. If the\ncoachman shook Miss Bygrave he should not have a half-penny for himself.\nMesmerism was frequently useful in these cases. Mr. Noel Vanstone's\nfather had been the most powerful mesmerist in Europe, and Mr. Noel\nVanstone was his father's son. Might he mesmerize? Might he order that\ninfernal coachman to draw up in a shady place adapted for the purpose?\nWould medical help be preferred? Could medical help be found any\nnearer than Aldborough? That ass of a coachman didn't know. Stop every\nrespectable man who passed in a gig, and ask him if he was a doctor! So\nMr. Noel Vanstone ran on, with brief intervals for breathing-time, in a\ncontinually-ascending scale of sympathy and self-importance, throughout\nthe drive home.\n\nMrs. Lecount accepted her defeat without uttering a word. From the\nmoment when Captain Wragge interrupted her, her thin lips closed and\nopened no more for the remainder of the journey. The warmest expressions\nof her master's anxiety for the suffering young lady provoked from her\nno outward manifestations of anger. She took as little notice of him\nas possible. She paid no attention whatever to the captain, whose\nexasperating consideration for his vanquished enemy made him more polite\nto her than ever. The nearer and the nearer they got to Aldborough the\nmore and more fixedly Mrs. Lecount's hard black eyes looked at Magdalen\nreclining on the opposite seat, with her eyes closed and her veil down.\n\nIt was only when the carriage stopped at North Shingles, and when\nCaptain Wragge was handing Magdalen out, that the housekeeper at last\ncondescended to notice him. As he smiled and took off his hat at the\ncarriage door, the strong restraint she had laid on herself suddenly\ngave way, and she flashed one look at him which scorched up the\ncaptain's politeness on the spot. He turned at once, with a hasty\nacknowledgment of Noel Vanstone's last sympathetic inquiries, and took\nMagdalen into the house. \"I told you she would show her claws,\" he said.\n\"It is not my fault that she scratched you before I could stop her. She\nhasn't hurt you, has she?\"\n\n\"She has hurt me, to some purpose,\" said Magdalen--\"she has given me the\ncourage to go on. Say what must be done to-morrow, and trust me to do\nit.\" She sighed heavily as she said those words, and went up to her\nroom.\n\nCaptain Wragge walked meditatively into the parlor, and sat down to\nconsider. He felt by no means so certain as he could have wished of the\nnext proceeding on the part of the enemy after the defeat of that day.\nThe housekeeper's farewell look had plainly informed him that she was\nnot at the end of her resources yet, and the old militia-man felt the\nfull importance of preparing himself in good time to meet the next step\nwhich she took in advance. He lit a cigar, and bent his wary mind on the\ndangers of the future.\n\nWhile Captain Wragge was considering in the parlor at North Shingles,\nMrs. Lecount was meditating in her bedroom at Sea View. Her exasperation\nat the failure of her first attempt to expose the conspiracy had not\nblinded her to the instant necessity of making a second effort before\nNoel Vanstone's growing infatuation got beyond her control. The snare\nset for Magdalen having failed, the chance of entrapping Magdalen's\nsister was the next chance to try. Mrs. Lecount ordered a cup of tea,\nopened her writing-case, and began the rough draft of a letter to be\nsent to Miss Vanstone, the elder, by the morrow's post.\n\nSo the day's skirmish ended. The heat of the battle was yet to come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nALL human penetration has its limits. Accurately as Captain Wragge\nhad seen his way hitherto, even his sharp insight was now at fault. He\nfinished his cigar with the mortifying conviction that he was totally\nunprepared for Mrs. Lecount's next proceeding. In this emergency, his\nexperience warned him that there was one safe course, and one only,\nwhich he could take. He resolved to try the confusing effect on the\nhousekeeper of a complete change of tactics before she had time to press\nher advantage and attack him in the dark. With this view he sent the\nservant upstairs to request that Miss Bygrave would come down and speak\nto him.\n\n\"I hope I don't disturb you,\" said the captain, when Magdalen entered\nthe room. \"Allow me to apologize for the smell of tobacco, and to say\ntwo words on the subject of our next proceedings. To put it with my\ncustomary frankness, Mrs. Lecount puzzles me, and I propose to return\nthe compliment by puzzling her. The course of action which I have to\nsuggest is a very simple one. I have had the honor of giving you a\nsevere neuralgic attack already, and I beg your permission (when Mr.\nNoel Vanstone sends to inquire to-morrow morning) to take the further\nliberty of laying you up altogether. Question from Sea-view Cottage:\n'How is Miss Bygrave this morning?' Answer from North Shingles: 'Much\nworse: Miss Bygrave is confined to her room.' Question repeated every\nday, say for a fortnight: 'How is Miss Bygrave?' Answer repeated,\nif necessary, for the same time: 'No better.' Can you bear the\nimprisonment? I see no objection to your getting a breath of fresh air\nthe first thing in the morning, or the last thing at night. But for the\nwhole of the day, there is no disguising it, you must put yourself in\nthe same category with Mrs. Wragge--you must keep your room.\"\n\n\"What is your object in wishing me to do this?\" inquired Magdalen.\n\n\"My object is twofold,\" replied the captain. \"I blush for my own\nstupidity; but the fact is, I can't see my way plainly to Mrs. Lecount's\nnext move. All I feel sure of is, that she means to make another attempt\nat opening her master's eyes to the truth. Whatever means she may employ\nto discover your identity, personal communication with you _must_ be\nnecessary to the accomplishment of her object. Very good. If I stop that\ncommunication, I put an obstacle in her way at starting--or, as we say\nat cards, I force her hand. Do you see the point?\"\n\nMagdalen saw it plainly. The captain went on.\n\n\"My second reason for shutting you up,\" he said, \"refers entirely to\nMrs. Lecount's master. The growth of love, my dear girl, is, in\none respect, unlike all other growths--it flourishes under adverse\ncircumstances. Our first course of action is to make Mr. Noel Vanstone\nfeel the charm of your society. Our next is to drive him distracted by\nthe loss of it. I should have proposed a few more meetings, with a view\nto furthering this end, but for our present critical position toward\nMrs. Lecount. As it is, we must trust to the effect you produced\nyesterday, and try the experiment of a sudden separation rather sooner\nthan I could have otherwise wished. I shall see Mr. Noel Vanstone,\nthough you don't; and if there _is_ a raw place established anywhere\nabout the region of that gentleman's heart, trust me to hit him on it!\nYou are now in full possession of my views. Take your time to consider,\nand give me your answer--Yes or no.\"\n\n\"Any change is for the better,\" said Magdalen \"which keeps me out of the\ncompany of Mrs. Lecount and her master! Let it be as you wish.\"\n\nShe had hitherto answered faintly and wearily; but she spoke those last\nwords with a heightened tone and a rising color--signs which warned\nCaptain Wragge not to press her further.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the captain. \"As usual, we understand each other. I\nsee you are tired; and I won't detain you any longer.\"\n\nHe rose to open the door, stopped half-way to it, and came back again.\n\"Leave me to arrange matters with the servant downstairs,\" he continued.\n\"You can't absolutely keep your bed, and we must purchase the girl's\ndiscretion when she answers the door, without taking her into our\nconfidence, of course. I will make her understand that she is to say you\nare ill, just as she might say you are not at home, as a way of keeping\nunwelcome acquaintances out of the house. Allow me to open the door\nfor you--I beg your pardon, you are going into Mrs. Wragge's work-room\ninstead of going to your own.\"\n\n\"I know I am,\" said Magdalen. \"I wish to remove Mrs. Wragge from the\nmiserable room she is in now, and to take her upstairs with me.\"\n\n\"For the evening?\"\n\n\"For the whole fortnight.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge followed her into the dining-room, and wisely closed the\ndoor before he spoke again.\n\n\"Do you seriously mean to inflict my wife's society on yourself for a\nfortnight?\" he asked, in great surprise.\n\n\"Your wife is the only innocent creature in this guilty house,\" she\nburst out vehemently. \"I must and will have her with me!\"\n\n\"Pray don't agitate yourself,\" said the captain. \"Take Mrs. Wragge,\nby all means. I don't want her.\" Having resigned the partner of his\nexistence in those terms, he discreetly returned to the parlor. \"The\nweakness of the sex!\" thought the captain, tapping his sagacious head.\n\"Lay a strain on the female intellect, and the female temper gives way\ndirectly.\"\n\nThe strain to which the captain alluded was not confined that evening\nto the female intellect at North Shingles: it extended to the female\nintellect at Sea View. For nearly two hours Mrs. Lecount sat at her\ndesk writing, correcting, and writing again, before she could produce\na letter to Miss Vanstone, the elder, which exactly accomplished the\nobject she wanted to attain. At last the rough draft was completed to\nher satisfaction; and she made a fair copy of it forthwith, to be posted\nthe next day.\n\nHer letter thus produced was a masterpiece of ingenuity. After the first\npreliminary sentences, the housekeeper plainly informed Norah of\nthe appearance of the visitor in disguise at Vauxhall Walk; of the\nconversation which passed at the interview; and of her own suspicion\nthat the person claiming to be Miss Garth was, in all probability, the\nyounger Miss Vanstone herself. Having told the truth thus far, Mrs.\nLecount next proceeded to say that her master was in possession of\nevidence which would justify him in putting the law in force; that he\nknew the conspiracy with which he was threatened to be then in process\nof direction against him at Aldborough; and that he only hesitated to\nprotect himself in deference to family considerations, and in the hope\nthat the elder Miss Vanstone might so influence her sister as to render\nit unnecessary to proceed to extremities.\n\nUnder these circumstances (the letter continued) it was plainly\nnecessary that the disguised visitor to Vauxhall Walk should be properly\nidentified; for if Mrs. Lecount's guess proved to be wrong, and if the\nperson turned out to be a stranger, Mr. Noel Vanstone was positively\nresolved to prosecute in his own defense. Events at Aldborough, on which\nit was not necessary to dwell, would enable Mrs. Lecount in a few days\nto gain sight of the suspected person in her own character. But as the\nhousekeeper was entirely unacquainted with the younger Miss Vanstone, it\nwas obviously desirable that some better informed person should, in this\nparticular, take the matter in hand. If the elder Miss Vanstone happened\nto be at liberty to come to Aldborough herself, would she kindly write\nand say so? and Mrs. Lecount would write back again to appoint a day.\nIf, on the other hand, Miss Vanstone was prevented from taking the\njourney, Mrs. Lecount suggested that her reply should contain the\nfullest description of her sister's personal appearance--should mention\nany little peculiarities which might exist in the way of marks on her\nface or her hands--and should state (in case she had written lately)\nwhat the address was in her last letter, and failing that, what the\npost-mark was on the envelope. With this information to help her, Mrs.\nLecount would, in the interest of the misguided young lady herself,\naccept the responsibility of privately identifying her, and would write\nback immediately to acquaint the elder Miss Vanstone with the result.\n\nThe difficulty of sending this letter to the right address gave Mrs.\nLecount very little trouble. Remembering the name of the lawyer who had\npleaded the cause of the two sisters in Michael Vanstone's time, she\ndirected her letter to \"Miss Vanstone, care of----Pendril, Esquire,\nLondon.\" This she inclosed in a second envelope, addressed to Mr. Noel\nVanstone's solicitor, with a line inside, requesting that gentleman to\nsend it at once to the office of Mr. Pendril.\n\n\"Now,\" thought Mrs. Lecount, as she locked the letter up in her desk,\npreparatory to posting it the next day with her own hand, \"now I have\ngot her!\"\n\n\nThe next morning the servant from Sea View came, with her master's\ncompliments, to make inquiries after Miss Bygrave's health. Captain\nWragge's bulletin was duly announced--Miss Bygrave was so ill as to be\nconfined to her room.\n\nOn the reception of this intelligence, Noel Vanstone's anxiety led him\nto call at North Shingles himself when he went out for his afternoon\nwalk. Miss Bygrave was no better. He inquired if he could see Mr.\nBygrave. The worthy captain was prepared to meet this emergency. He\nthought a little irritating suspense would do Noel Vanstone no harm,\nand he had carefully charged the servant, in case of necessity, with her\nanswer: \"Mr. Bygrave begged to be excused; he was not able to see any\none.\"\n\nOn the second day inquiries were made as before, by message in the\nmorning, and by Noel Vanstone himself in the afternoon. The morning\nanswer (relating to Magdalen) was, \"a shade better.\" The afternoon\nanswer (relating to Captain Wragge) was, \"Mr. Bygrave has just gone\nout.\" That evening Noel Vanstone's temper was very uncertain, and Mrs.\nLecount's patience and tact were sorely tried in the effort to avoid\noffending him.\n\nOn the third morning the report of the suffering young lady was less\nfavorable--\"Miss Bygrave was still very poorly, and not able to leave\nher bed.\" The servant returning to Sea View with this message, met the\npostman, and took into the breakfast-room with her two letters addressed\nto Mrs. Lecount.\n\nThe first letter was in a handwriting familiar to the housekeeper. It\nwas from the medical attendant on her invalid brother at Zurich; and it\nannounced that the patient's malady had latterly altered in so marked\na manner for the better that there was every hope now of preserving his\nlife.\n\nThe address on the second letter was in a strange handwriting. Mrs.\nLecount, concluding that it was the answer from Miss Vanstone, waited to\nread it until breakfast was over, and she could retire to her own room.\n\nShe opened the letter, looked at once for the name at the end, and\nstarted a little as she read it. The signature was not \"Norah Vanstone,\"\nbut \"Harriet Garth.\"\n\n\nMiss Garth announced that the elder Miss Vanstone had, a week since,\naccepted an engagement as governess, subject to the condition of joining\nthe family of her employer at their temporary residence in the south\nof France, and of returning with them when they came back to England,\nprobably in a month or six weeks' time. During the interval of this\nnecessary absence Miss Vanstone had requested Miss Garth to open all her\nletters, her main object in making that arrangement being to provide\nfor the speedy answering of any communication which might arrive for her\nfrom her sister. Miss Magdalen Vanstone had not written since the middle\nof July--on which occasion the postmark on the letter showed that it\nmust have been posted in London, in the district of Lambeth--and her\nelder sister had left England in a state of the most distressing anxiety\non her account.\n\nHaving completed this explanation, Miss Garth then mentioned that family\ncircumstances prevented her from traveling personally to Aldborough\nto assist Mrs. Lecount's object, but that she was provided with a\nsubstitute; in every way fitter for the purpose, in the person of Mr.\nPendril. That gentleman was well acquainted with Miss Magdalen Vanstone,\nand his professional experience and discretion would render his\nassistance doubly valuable. He had kindly consented to travel to\nAldborough whenever it might be thought necessary. But as his time was\nvery valuable, Miss Garth specially requested that he might not be sent\nfor until Mrs. Lecount was quite sure of the day on which his services\nmight be required.\n\nWhile proposing this arrangement, Miss Garth added that she thought it\nright to furnish her correspondent with a written description of the\nyounger Miss Vanstone as well. An emergency might happen which would\nallow Mrs. Lecount no time for securing Mr. Pendril's services; and the\nexecution of Mr. Noel Vanstone's intentions toward the unhappy girl\nwho was the object of his forbearance might be fatally delayed by\nan unforeseen difficulty in establishing her identity. The personal\ndescription, transmitted under these circumstances, then followed. It\nomitted no personal peculiarity by which Magdalen could be recognized,\nand it included the \"two little moles close together on the left side\nof the neck,\" which had been formerly mentioned in the printed handbills\nsent to York.\n\nIn conclusion, Miss Garth expressed her fears that Mrs. Lecount's\nsuspicions were only too likely to be proved true. While, however,\nthere was the faintest chance that the conspiracy might turn out to be\ndirected by a stranger, Miss Garth felt bound, in gratitude toward Mr.\nNoel Vanstone, to assist the legal proceedings which would in that case\nbe instituted. She accordingly appended her own formal denial--which she\nwould personally repeat if necessary--of any identity between herself\nand the person in disguise who had made use of her name. She was\nthe Miss Garth who had filled the situation of the late Mr. Andrew\nVanstone's governess, and she had never in her life been in, or near,\nthe neighborhood of Vauxhall Wall.\n\nWith this disclaimer, and with the writer's fervent assurances that she\nwould do all for Magdalen's advantage which her sister might have done\nif her sister had been in England, the letter concluded. It was signed\nin full, and was dated with the business-like accuracy in such matters\nwhich had always distinguished Miss Garth's character.\n\n\nThis letter placed a formidable weapon in the housekeeper's hands.\n\nIt provided a means of establishing Magdalen's identity through\nthe intervention of a lawyer by profession. It contained a personal\ndescription minute enough to be used to advantage, if necessary, before\nMr. Pendril's appearance. It presented a signed exposure of the false\nMiss Garth under the hand of the true Miss Garth; and it established the\nfact that the last letter received by the elder Miss Vanstone from\nthe younger had been posted (and therefore probably written) in the\nneighborhood of Vauxhall Walk. If any later letter had been received\nwith the Aldborough postmark, the chain of evidence, so far as the\nquestion of localities was concerned, might doubtless have been more\ncomplete. But as it was, there was testimony enough (aided as that\ntestimony might be by the fragment of the brown alpaca dress still\nin Mrs. Lecount's possession) to raise the veil which hung over the\nconspiracy, and to place Mr. Noel Vanstone face to face with the plain\nand startling truth.\n\nThe one obstacle which now stood in the way of immediate action on the\nhousekeeper's part was the obstacle of Miss Bygrave's present seclusion\nwithin the limits of her own room. The question of gaining personal\naccess to her was a question which must be decided before any\ncommunication could be opened with Mr. Pendril. Mrs. Lecount put on her\nbonnet at once, and called at North Shingles to try what discoveries she\ncould make for herself before post-time.\n\nOn this occasion Mr. Bygrave was at home, and she was admitted without\nthe least difficulty.\n\nCareful consideration that morning had dec ided Captain Wragge on\nadvancing matters a little nearer to the crisis. The means by which\nhe proposed achieving this result made it necessary for him to see the\nhousekeeper and her master separately, and to set them at variance by\nproducing two totally opposite impressions relating to himself on their\nminds. Mrs. Lecount's visit, therefore, instead of causing him any\nembarrassment, was the most welcome occurrence he could have wished\nfor. He received her in the parlor with a marked restraint of manner for\nwhich she was quite unprepared. His ingratiating smile was gone, and an\nimpenetrable solemnity of countenance appeared in its stead.\n\n\"I have ventured to intrude on you, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, \"to express\nthe regret with which both my master and I have heard of Miss Bygrave's\nillness. Is there no improvement?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" replied the captain, as briefly as possible. \"My niece is\nno better.\"\n\n\"I have had some experience, Mr. Bygrave, in nursing. If I could be of\nany use--\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Lecount. There is no necessity for our taking advantage\nof your kindness.\"\n\nThis plain answer was followed by a moment's silence. The housekeeper\nfelt some little perplexity. What had become of Mr. Bygrave's elaborate\ncourtesy, and Mr. Bygrave's many words? Did he want to offend her? If he\ndid, Mrs. Lecount then and there determined that he should not gain his\nobject.\n\n\"May I inquire the nature of the illness?\" she persisted. \"It is not\nconnected, I hope, with our excursion to Dunwich?\"\n\n\"I regret to say, ma'am,\" replied the captain, \"it began with that\nneuralgic attack in the carriage.\"\n\n\"So! so!\" thought Mrs. Lecount. \"He doesn't even _try_ to make me think\nthe illness a real one; he throws off the mask at starting.--Is it a\nnervous illness, sir?\" she added, aloud.\n\nThe captain answered by a solemn affirmative inclination of the head.\n\n\"Then you have _two_ nervous sufferers in the house, Mr. Bygrave?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am--two. My wife and my niece.\"\n\n\"That is rather a strange coincidence of misfortunes.\"\n\n\"It is, ma'am. Very strange.\"\n\nIn spite of Mrs. Lecount's resolution not to be offended, Captain\nWragge's exasperating insensibility to every stroke she aimed at him\nbegan to ruffle her. She was conscious of some little difficulty in\nsecuring her self-possession before she could say anything more.\n\n\"Is there no immediate hope,\" she resumed, \"of Miss Bygrave being able\nto leave her room?\"\n\n\"None whatever, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You are satisfied, I suppose, with the medical attendance?\"\n\n\"I have no medical attendance,\" said the captain, composedly. \"I watch\nthe case myself.\"\n\nThe gathering venom in Mrs. Lecount swelled up at that reply, and\noverflowed at her lips.\n\n\"Your smattering of science, sir,\" she said, with a malicious smile,\n\"includes, I presume, a smattering of medicine as well?\"\n\n\"It does, ma'am,\" answered the captain, without the slightest\ndisturbance of face or manner. \"I know as much of one as I do of the\nother.\"\n\nThe tone in which he spoke those words left Mrs. Lecount but one\ndignified alternative. She rose to terminate the interview. The\ntemptation of the moment proved too much for her, and she could not\nresist casting the shadow of a threat over Captain Wragge at parting.\n\n\"I defer thanking you, sir, for the manner in which you have received\nme,\" she said, \"until I can pay my debt of obligation to some purpose.\nIn the meantime I am glad to infer, from the absence of a medical\nattendant in the house, that Miss Bygrave's illness is much less serious\nthan I had supposed it to be when I came here.\"\n\n\"I never contradict a lady, ma'am,\" rejoined the incorrigible captain.\n\"If it is your pleasure, when we next meet to think my niece quite well,\nI shall bow resignedly to the expression of your opinion.\" With those\nwords, he followed the housekeeper into the passage, and politely opened\nthe door for her. \"I mark the trick, ma'am!\" he said to himself, as he\nclosed it again. \"The trump-card in your hand is a sight of my niece,\nand I'll take care you don't play it!\"\n\nHe returned to the parlor, and composedly awaited the next event which\nwas likely to happen--a visit from Mrs. Lecount's master. In less than\nan hour results justified Captain Wragge's anticipations, and Noel\nVanstone walked in.\n\n\"My dear sir!\" cried the captain, cordially seizing his visitor's\nreluctant hand, \"I know what you have come for. Mrs. Lecount has told\nyou of her visit here, and has no doubt declared that my niece's illness\nis a mere subterfuge. You feel surprised--you feel hurt--you suspect\nme of trifling with your kind sympathies--in short, you require an\nexplanation. That explanation you shall have. Take a seat. Mr. Vanstone.\nI am about to throw myself on your sense and judgment as a man of the\nworld. I acknowledge that we are in a false position, sir; and I tell\nyou plainly at the outset--your housekeeper is the cause of it.\"\n\nFor once in his life, Noel Vanstone opened his eyes. \"Lecount!\" he\nexclaimed, in the utmost bewilderment.\n\n\"The same, sir,\" replied Captain Wragge. \"I am afraid I offended Mrs.\nLecount, when she came here this morning, by a want of cordiality in my\nmanner. I am a plain man, and I can't assume what I don't feel. Far be\nit from me to breathe a word against your housekeeper's character. She\nis, no doubt, a most excellent and trustworthy woman, but she has one\nserious failing common to persons at her time of life who occupy her\nsituation--she is jealous of her influence over her master, although you\nmay not have observed it.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" interposed Noel Vanstone; \"my observation is\nremarkably quick. Nothing escapes me.\"\n\n\"In that case, sir,\" resumed the captain, \"you cannot fail to have\nnoticed that Mrs. Lecount has allowed her jealousy to affect her conduct\ntoward my niece?\"\n\nNoel Vanstone thought of the domestic passage at arms between Mrs.\nLecount and himself when his guests of the evening had left Sea View,\nand failed to see his way to any direct reply. He expressed the utmost\nsurprise and distress--he thought Lecount had done her best to be\nagreeable on the drive to Dunwich--he hoped and trusted there was some\nunfortunate mistake.\n\n\"Do you mean to say, sir,\" pursued the captain, severely, \"that you have\nnot noticed the circumstance yourself? As a man of honor and a man of\nobservation, you can't tell me that! Your housekeeper's superficial\ncivility has not hidden your housekeeper's real feeling. My niece has\nseen it, and so have you, and so have I. My niece, Mr. Vanstone, is\na sensitive, high-spirited girl; and she has positively declined to\ncultivate Mrs. Lecount's society for the future. Don't misunderstand me!\nTo my niece as well as to myself, the attraction of _your_ society, Mr.\nVanstone, remains the same. Miss Bygrave simply declines to be an apple\nof discord (if you will permit the classical allusion) cast into your\nhousehold. I think she is right so far, and I frankly confess that\nI have exaggerated a nervous indisposition, from which she is really\nsuffering, into a serious illness--purely and entirely to prevent these\ntwo ladies for the present from meeting every day on the Parade, and\nfrom carrying unpleasant impressions of each other into your domestic\nestablishment and mine.\"\n\n\"I allow nothing unpleasant in _my_ establishment,\" remarked Noel\nVanstone. \"I'm master--you must have noticed that already, Mr.\nBygrave--I'm master.\"\n\n\"No doubt of it, my dear sir. But to live morning, noon, and night in\nthe perpetual exercise of your authority is more like the life of a\ngovernor of a prison than the life of a master of a household. The wear\nand tear--consider the wear and tear.\"\n\n\"It strikes you in that light, does it?\" said Noel Vanstone, soothed by\nCaptain Wragge's ready recognition of his authority. \"I don't know that\nyou're not right. But I must take some steps directly. I won't be made\nridiculous--I'll send Lecount away altogether, sooner than be made\nridiculous.\" His color rose, and he folded his little arms fiercely.\nCaptain Wragge's artfully irritating explanation had awakened that\ndormant suspicion of his housekeeper's influence over him which\nhabitually lay hidden in his mind, and which Mrs. Lecount was now not\npresent to charm back to repose as usual. \"What must Miss Bygrave think\nof me!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden outburst of vexation. \"I'll send\nLecount away. Damme, I'll send Lecount away on the spot!\"\n\n\"No, no, no!\" said the captain, whose interest it was to avoid driving\nMrs. Lecount to any desperate extremities. \"Why take strong measures\nwhen mild measures will do? Mrs. Lecount is an old servant; Mrs.\nLecount is attached and useful. She has this little drawback of\njealousy--jealousy of her domestic position with her bachelor master.\nShe sees you paying courteous attention to a handsome young lady; she\nsees that young lady properly sensible of your politeness; and, poor\nsoul, she loses her temper! What is the obvious remedy? Humor her--make\na manly concession to the weaker sex. If Mrs. Lecount is with you, the\nnext time we meet on the Parade, walk the other way. If Mrs. Lecount\nis not with you, give us the pleasure of your company by all means. In\nshort, my dear sir, try the _suaviter in modo_ (as we classical men say)\nbefore you commit yourself to the _fortiter in re!\"_\n\nThere was one excellent reason why Noel Vanstone should take Captain\nWragge's conciliatory advice. An open rupture with Mrs. Lecount--even\nif he could have summoned the courage to face it--would imply the\nrecognition of her claims to a provision, in acknowledgment of the\nservices she had rendered to his father and to himself. His sordid\nnature quailed within him at the bare prospect of expressing the\nemotion of gratitude in a pecuniary form; and, after first consulting\nappearances by a show of hesitation, he consented to adopt the captain's\nsuggestion, and to humor Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"But I must be considered in this matter,\" proceeded Noel Vanstone. \"My\nconcession to Lecount's weakness must not be misunderstood. Miss Bygrave\nmust not be allowed to suppose I am afraid of my housekeeper.\"\n\nThe captain declared that no such idea ever had entered, or ever could\nenter, Miss Bygrave's mind. Noel Vanstone returned to the subject\nnevertheless, again and again, with his customary pertinacity. Would\nit be indiscreet if he asked leave to set himself right personally with\nMiss Bygrave? Was there any hope that he might have the happiness of\nseeing her on that day? or, if not, on the next day? or if not, on the\nday after? Captain Wragge answered cautiously: he felt the importance\nof not rousing Noel Vanstone's distrust by too great an alacrity in\ncomplying with his wishes.\n\n\"An interview to-day, my dear sir, is out of the question,\" he said.\n\"She is not well enough; she wants repose. To-morrow I propose\ntaking her out before the heat of the day begins--not merely to avoid\nembarrassment, after what has happened with Mrs. Lecount, but because\nthe morning air and the morning quiet are essential in these nervous\ncases. We are early people here--we shall start at seven o'clock. If you\nare early, too, and if you would like to join us, I need hardly say that\nwe can feel no objection to your company on our morning walk. The hour,\nI am aware, is an unusual one--but later in the day my niece may be\nresting on the sofa, and may not be able to see visitors.\"\n\nHaving made this proposal purely for the purpose of enabling Noel\nVanstone to escape to North Shingles at an hour in the morning when his\nhousekeeper would be probably in bed, Captain Wragge left him to take\nthe hint, if he could, as indirectly as it had been given. He proved\nsharp enough (the case being one in which his own interests were\nconcerned) to close with the proposal on the spot. Politely declaring\nthat he was always an early man when the morning presented any special\nattraction to him, he accepted the appointment for seven o'clock, and\nrose soon afterward to take his leave.\n\n\"One word at parting,\" said Captain Wragge. \"This conversation is\nentirely between ourselves. Mrs. Lecount must know nothing of the\nimpression she has produced on my niece. I have only mentioned it to you\nto account for my apparently churlish conduct and to satisfy your\nown mind. In confidence, Mr. Vanstone--strictly in confidence.\nGood-morning!\"\n\nWith these parting words, the captain bowed his visitor out. Unless some\nunexpected disaster occurred, he now saw his way safely to the end\nof the enterprise. He had gained two important steps in advance that\nmorning. He had sown the seeds of variance between the housekeeper\nand her master, and he had given Noel Vanstone a common interest with\nMagdalen and himself, in keeping a secret from Mrs. Lecount. \"We\nhave caught our man,\" thought Captain Wragge, cheerfully rubbing his\nhands--\"we have caught our man at last!\"\n\nOn leaving North Shingles Noel Vanstone walked straight home, fully\nrestored to his place in his own estimation, and sternly determined to\ncarry matters with a high hand if he found himself in collision with\nMrs. Lecount.\n\nThe housekeeper received her master at the door with her mildest manner\nand her gentlest smile. She addressed him with downcast eyes; she\nopposed to his contemplated assertion of independence a barrier of\nimpenetrable respect.\n\n\"May I venture to ask, sir,\" she began, \"if your visit to North Shingles\nhas led you to form the same conclusion as mine on the subject of Miss\nBygrave's illness?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Lecount. I consider your conclusion to have been both\nhasty and prejudiced.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear it, sir. I felt hurt by Mr. Bygrave's rude reception\nof me, but I was not aware that my judgment was prejudiced by it.\nPerhaps he received _you_, sir, with a warmer welcome?\"\n\n\"He received me like a gentleman--that is all I think it necessary to\nsay, Lecount--he received me like a gentleman.\"\n\nThis answer satisfied Mrs. Lecount on the one doubtful point that had\nperplexed her. Whatever Mr. Bygrave's sudden coolness toward herself\nmight mean, his polite reception of her master implied that the risk\nof detection had not daunted him, and that the plot was still in\nfull progress. The housekeeper's eyes brightened; she had expressly\ncalculated on this result. After a moment's thinking, she addressed\nher master with another question: \"You will probably visit Mr. Bygrave\nagain, sir?\"\n\n\"Of course I shall visit him--if I please.\"\n\n\"And perhaps see Miss Bygrave, if she gets better?\"\n\n\"Why not? I should be glad to know why not? Is it necessary to ask your\nleave first, Lecount?\"\n\n\"By no means, sir. As you have often said (and as I have often agreed\nwith you), you are master. It may surprise you to hear it, Mr. Noel,\nbut I have a private reason for wishing that you should see Miss Bygrave\nagain.\"\n\nMr. Noel started a little, and looked at his housekeeper with some\ncuriosity.\n\n\"I have a strange fancy of my own, sir, about that young lady,\"\nproceeded Mrs. Lecount. \"If you will excuse my fancy, and indulge it,\nyou will do me a favor for which I shall be very grateful.\"\n\n\"A fancy?\" repeated her master, in growing surprise. \"What fancy?\"\n\n\"Only this, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount.\n\nShe took from one of the neat little pockets of her apron a morsel of\nnote-paper, carefully folded into the smallest possible compass, and\nrespectfully placed it in Noel Vanstone's hands.\n\n\"If you are willing to oblige an old and faithful servant, Mr. Noel,\"\nshe said, in a very quiet and very impressive manner, \"you will kindly\nput that morsel of paper into your waistcoat pocket; you will open\nand read it, for the first time, _when you are next in Miss Bygrave's\ncompany_, and you will say nothing of what has now passed between us\nto any living creature, from this time to that. I promise to explain my\nstrange request, sir, when you have done what I ask, and when your next\ninterview with Miss Bygrave has come to an end.\"\n\nShe courtesied with her best grace, and quietly left the room.\n\nNoel Vanstone looked from the folded paper to the door, and from the\ndoor back to the folded paper, in unutterable astonishment. A mystery in\nhis own house! under his own nose! What did it mean?\n\nIt meant that Mrs. Lecount had not wasted her time that morning. While\nthe captain was casting the net over his visitor at North Shingles, the\nhousekeeper was steadily mining the ground under his feet. The folded\npaper contained nothing less than a carefully written extract from the\npersonal description of Magdalen in Miss Garth's letter. With a daring\ningenuity which even Captain Wragge might have envied, Mrs. Lecount had\nfound her instrument for exposing the conspiracy in the unsuspecting\nperson of the victim himself!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nLATE that evening, when Magdalen and Mrs. Wragge came back from their\nwalk in the dark, the captain stopped Magdalen on her way upstairs to\ninform her of the proceedings of the day. He added the expression of\nhis opinion that the time had come for bringing Noel Vanstone, with\nthe least possible delay, to the point of making a proposal. She\nmerely answered that she understood him, and that she would do what was\nrequired of her. Captain Wragge requested her in that case to oblige him\nby joining a walking excursion in Mr. Noel Vanstone's company at seven\no'clock the next morning. \"I will be ready,\" she replied. \"Is there\nanything more?\" There was nothing more. Magdalen bade him good-night and\nreturned to her own room.\n\nShe had shown the same disinclination to remain any longer than was\nnecessary in the captain's company throughout the three days of her\nseclusion in the house.\n\nDuring all that time, instead of appearing to weary of Mrs. Wragge's\nsociety, she had patiently, almost eagerly, associated herself with her\ncompanion's one absorbing pursuit. She who had often chafed and\nfretted in past days under the monotony of her life in the freedom of\nCombe-Raven, now accepted without a murmur the monotony of her life at\nMrs. Wragge's work-table. She who had hated the sight of her needle and\nthread in old times--who had never yet worn an article of dress of her\nown making--now toiled as anxiously over the making of Mrs. Wragge's\ngown, and bore as patiently with Mrs. Wragge's blunders, as if the sole\nobject of her existence had been the successful completion of that one\ndress. Anything was welcome to her--the trivial difficulties of fitting\na gown: the small, ceaseless chatter of the poor half-witted\ncreature who was so proud of her assistance, and so happy in her\ncompany--anything was welcome that shut her out from the coming future,\nfrom the destiny to which she stood self-condemned. That sorely-wounded\nnature was soothed by such a trifle now as the grasp of her companion's\nrough and friendly hand--that desolate heart was cheered, when night\nparted them, by Mrs. Wragge's kiss.\n\nThe captain's isolated position in the house produced no depressing\neffect on the captain's easy and equal spirits. Instead of resenting\nMagdalen's systematic avoidance of his society, he looked to results,\nand highly approved of it. The more she neglected him for his wife\nthe more directly useful she became in the character of Mrs. Wragge's\nself-appointed guardian. He had more than once seriously contemplated\nrevoking the concession which had been extorted from him, and removing\nhis wife, at his own sole responsibility, out of harm's way; and he had\nonly abandoned the idea on discovering that Magdalen's resolution to\nkeep Mrs. Wragge in her own company was really serious. While the two\nwere together, his main anxiety was set at rest. They kept their door\nlocked by his own desire while he was out of the house, and, whatever\nMrs. Wragge might do, Magdalen was to be trusted not to open it until\nhe came back. That night Captain Wragge enjoyed his cigar with a mind at\nease, and sipped his brandy-and-water in happy ignorance of the pitfall\nwhich Mrs. Lecount had prepared for him in the morning.\n\nPunctually at seven o'clock Noel Vanstone made his appearance. The\nmoment he entered the room Captain Wragge detected a change in his\nvisitor's look and manner. \"Something wrong!\" thought the captain. \"We\nhave not done with Mrs. Lecount yet.\"\n\n\"How is Miss Bygrave this morning?\" asked Noel Vanstone. \"Well enough,\nI hope, for our early walk?\" His half-closed eyes, weak and watery with\nthe morning light and the morning air, looked about the room furtively,\nand he shifted his place in a restless manner from one chair to another,\nas he made those polite inquiries.\n\n\"My niece is better--she is dressing for the walk,\" replied the captain,\nsteadily observing his restless little friend while he spoke. \"Mr.\nVanstone!\" he added, on a sudden, \"I am a plain Englishman--excuse\nmy blunt way of speaking my mind. You don't meet me this morning as\ncordially as you met me yesterday. There is something unsettled in your\nface. I distrust that housekeeper of yours, sir! Has she been presuming\non your forbearance? Has she been trying to poison your mind against me\nor my niece?\"\n\nIf Noel Vanstone had obeyed Mrs. Lecount's injunctions, and had kept her\nlittle morsel of note-paper folded in his pocket until the time came to\nuse it, Captain Wragge's designedly blunt appeal might not have found\nhim unprepared with an answer. But curiosity had got the better of\nhim; he had opened the note at night, and again in the morning; it had\nseriously perplexed and startled him; and it had left his mind far too\ndisturbed to allow him the possession of his ordinary resources. He\nhesitated; and his answer, when he succeeded in making it, began with a\nprevarication.\n\nCaptain Wragge stopped him before he had got beyond his first sentence.\n\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said the captain, in his loftiest manner. \"If you have\nsecrets to keep, you have only to say so, and I have done. I intrude on\nno man's secrets. At the same time, Mr. Vanstone, you must allow me to\nrecall to your memory that I met you yesterday without any reserves on\nmy side. I admitted you to my frankest and fullest confidence, sir--and,\nhighly as I prize the advantages of your society, I can't consent to\ncultivate your friendship on any other than equal terms.\" He threw open\nhis respectable frock-coat and surveyed his visitor with a manly and\nvirtuous severity.\n\n\"I mean no offense!\" cried Noel Vanstone, piteously. \"Why do you\ninterrupt me, Mr. Bygrave? Why don't you let me explain? I mean no\noffense.\"\n\n\"No offense is taken, sir,\" said the captain. \"You have a perfect right\nto the exercise of your own discretion. I am not offended--I only claim\nfor myself the same privilege which I accord to you.\" He rose with great\ndignity and rang the bell. \"Tell Miss Bygrave,\" he said to the servant,\n\"that our walk this morning is put off until another opportunity, and\nthat I won't trouble her to come downstairs.\"\n\nThis strong proceeding had the desired effect. Noel Vanstone vehemently\npleaded for a moment's private conversation before the message was\ndelivered. Captain Wragge's severity partially relaxed. He sent the\nservant downstairs again, and, resuming his chair, waited confidently\nfor results. In calculating the facilities for practicing on his\nvisitor's weakness, he had one great superiority over Mrs. Lecount. His\njudgment was not warped by latent female jealousies, and he avoided the\nerror into which the housekeeper had fallen, self-deluded--the error of\nunderrating the impression on Noel Vanstone that Magdalen had produced.\nOne of the forces in this world which no middle-aged woman is capable of\nestimating at its full value, when it acts against her, is the force of\nbeauty in a woman younger than herself.\n\n\"You are so hasty, Mr. Bygrave--you won't give me time--you won't wait\nand hear what I have to say!\" cried Noel Vanstone, piteously, when the\nservant had closed the parlor door.\n\n\"My family failing, sir--the blood of the Bygraves. Accept my excuses.\nWe are alone, as you wished; pray proceed.\"\n\nPlaced between the alternatives of losing Magdalen's society or\nbetraying Mrs. Lecount, unenlightened by any suspicion of the\nhousekeeper's ultimate object, cowed by the immovable scrutiny of\nCaptain Wragge's inquiring eye, Noel Vanstone was not long in making his\nchoice. He confusedly described his singular interview of the previous\nevening with Mrs. Lecount, and, taking the folded paper from his pocket,\nplaced it in the captain's hand.\n\nA suspicion of the truth dawned on Captain Wragge's mind the moment he\nsaw the mysterious note. He withdrew to the window before he opened it.\nThe first lines that attracted his attention were these: \"Oblige me, Mr.\nNoel, by comparing the young lady who is now in your company with the\npersonal description which follows these lines, and which has been\ncommunicated to me by a friend. You shall know the name of the person\ndescribed--which I have left a blank--as soon as the evidence of your\nown eyes has forced you to believe what you would refuse to credit on\nthe unsupported testimony of Virginie Lecount.\"\n\nThat was enough for the captain. Before he had read a word of the\ndescription itself, he knew what Mrs. Lecount had done, and felt, with\na profound sense of humiliation, that his female enemy had taken him by\nsurprise.\n\nThere was no time to think; the whole enterprise was threatened with\nirrevocable overthrow. The one resource in Captain Wragge's present\nsituation was to act instantly on the first impulse of his own audacity.\nLine by line he read on, and still the ready inventiveness which had\nnever deserted him yet failed to answer the call made on it now. He\ncame to the closing sentence--to the last words which mentioned the\ntwo little moles on Magdalen's neck. At that crowning point of the\ndescription, an idea crossed his mind; his party-colored eyes twinkled;\nhis curly lips twisted up at the corners; Wragge was himself again.\nHe wheeled round suddenly from the window, and looked Noel Vanstone\nstraight in the face with a grimly-quiet suggestiveness of something\nserious to come.\n\n\"Pray, sir, do you happen to know anything of Mrs. Lecount's family?\" he\ninquired.\n\n\"A respectable family,\" said Noel Vanstone--\"that's all I know. Why do\nyou ask?\"\n\n\"I am not usually a betting man,\" pursued Captain Wragge. \"But on this\noccasion I will lay you any wager you like there is madness in your\nhousekeeper's family.\"\n\n\"Madness!\" repeated Noel Vanstone, amazedly\n\n\"Madness!\" reiterated the captain, sternly tapping the note with his\nforefinger. \"I see the cunning of insanity, the suspicion of insanity,\nthe feline treachery of insanity in every line of this deplorable\ndocument. There is a far more alarming reason, sir, than I had supposed\nfor Mrs. Lecount's behavior to my niece. It is clear to me that Miss\nBygrave resembles some other lady who has seriously offended your\nhousekeeper--who has been formerly connected, perhaps, with an outbreak\nof insanity in your housekeeper--and who is now evidently confused with\nmy niece in your housekeeper's wandering mind. That is my conviction,\nMr. Vanstone. I may be right, or I may be wrong. All I say is\nthis--neither you, nor any man, can assign a sane motive for the\nproduction of that incomprehensible document, and for the use which you\nare requested to make of it.\"\n\n\"I don't think Lecount's mad,\" said Noel Vanstone, with a very blank\nlook, and a very discomposed manner. \"It couldn't have escaped me,\nwith my habits of observation; it couldn't possibly have escaped me if\nLecount had been mad.\"\n\n\"Very good, my dear sir. In my opinion, she is the subject of an insane\ndelusion. In your opinion, she is in possession of her senses, and has\nsome mysterious motive which neither you nor I can fathom. Either way,\nthere can be no harm in putting Mrs. Lecount's description to the test,\nnot only as a matter of curiosity, but for our own private satisfaction\non both sides. It is of course impossible to tell my niece that she is\nto be made the subject of such a preposterous experiment as that note\nof yours suggests. But you can use your own eyes, Mr. Vanstone; you\ncan keep your own counsel; and--mad or not--you can at least tell your\nhousekeeper, on the testimony of your own senses, that she is wrong. Let\nme look at the description again. The greater part of it is not worth\ntwo straws for any purpose of identification; hundreds of young ladies\nhave tall figures, fair complexions, light brown hair, and light gray\neyes. You will say, on the other hand, hundreds of young ladies have not\ngot two little moles close together on the left side of the neck. Quite\ntrue. The moles supply us with what we scientific men call a Crucial\nTest. When my niece comes downstairs, sir, you have my full permission\nto take the liberty of looking at her neck.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone expressed his high approval of the Crucial Test by\nsmirking and simpering for the first time that morning.\n\n\"Of looking at her neck,\" repeated the captain, returning the note to\nhis visitor, and then making for the door. \"I will go upstairs myself,\nMr. Vanstone,\" he continued, \"and inspect Miss Bygrave's walking-dress.\nIf she has innocently placed any obstacles in your way, if her hair is\na little too low, or her frill is a little too high, I will exert my\nauthority, on the first harmless pretext I can think of, to have those\nobstacles removed. All I ask is, that you will choose your opportunity\ndiscreetly, and that you will not allow my niece to suppose that her\nneck is the object of a gentleman's inspection.\"\n\nThe moment he was out of the parlor Captain Wragge ascended the stairs\nat the top of his speed and knocked at Magdalen's door. She opened it to\nhim in her walking-dress, obedient to the signal agreed on between them\nwhich summoned her downstairs.\n\n\"What have you done with your paints and powders?\" asked the captain,\nwithout wasting a word in preliminary explanations. \"They were not in\nthe box of costumes which I sold for you at Birmingham. Where are they?\"\n\n\"I have got them here,\" replied Magdalen. \"What can you possibly mean by\nwanting them now?\"\n\n\"Bring them instantly into my dressing-room--the whole collection,\nbrushes, palette, and everything. Don't waste time in asking questions;\nI'll tell you what has happened as we go on. Every moment is precious to\nus. Follow me instantly!\"\n\nHis face plainly showed that there was a serious reason for his strange\nproposal. Magdalen secured her collection of cosmetics and followed him\ninto the dressing-room. He locked the door, placed her on a chair close\nto the light, and then told her what had happened.\n\n\"We are on the brink of detection,\" proceeded the captain, carefully\nmixing his colors with liquid glue, and with a strong \"drier\" added from\na bottle in his own possession. \"There is only one chance for us (lift\nup your hair from the left side of your neck)--I have told Mr. Noel\nVanstone to take a private opportunity of looking at you; and I am going\nto give the lie direct to that she-devil Lecount by painting out your\nmoles.\"\n\n\"They can't be painted out,\" said Magdalen. \"No color will stop on\nthem.\"\n\n\"_My_ color will,\" remarked Captain Wragge. \"I have tried a variety of\nprofessions in my time--the profession of painting among the rest. Did\nyou ever hear of such a thing as a Black Eye? I lived some months once\nin the neighborhood of Drury Lane entirely on Black Eyes. My flesh-color\nstood on bruises of all sorts, shades, and sizes, and it will stand, I\npromise you, on your moles.\"\n\nWith this assurance, the captain dipped his brush into a little lump of\nopaque color which he had mixed in a saucer, and which he had graduated\nas nearly as the materials would permit to the color of Magdalen's skin.\nAfter first passing a cambric handkerchief, with some white powder on\nit, over the part of her neck on which he designed to operate, he placed\ntwo layers of color on the moles with the tip of the brush. The\nprocess was performed in a few moments, and the moles, as if by magic,\ndisappeared from view. Nothing but the closest inspection could have\ndiscovered the artifice by which they had been concealed; at the\ndistance of two or three feet only, it was perfectly invisible.\n\n\"Wait here five minutes,\" said Captain Wragge, \"to let the paint\ndry--and then join us in the parlor. Mrs. Lecount herself would be\npuzzled if she looked at you now.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" said Magdalen. \"There is one thing you have not told me yet. How\ndid Mrs. Lecount get the description which you read downstairs? Whatever\nelse she has seen of me, she has not seen the mark on my neck--it is too\nfar back, and too high up; my hair hides it.\"\n\n\"Who knows of the mark?\" asked Captain Wragge.\n\nShe turned deadly pale under the anguish of a sudden recollection of\nFrank.\n\n\"My sister knows it,\" she said, faintly.\n\n\"Mrs. Lecount may have written to your sister,\" suggested the captain:\n\n\"Do you think my sister would tell a stranger what no stranger has a\nright to know? Never! never!\"\n\n\"Is there nobody else who could tell Mrs. Lecount? The mark was\nmentioned in the handbills at York. Who put it there?\"\n\n\"Not Norah! Perhaps Mr. Pendril. Perhaps Miss Garth.\"\n\n\"Then Mrs. Lecount has written to Mr. Pendril or Miss Garth--more likely\nto Miss Garth. The governess would be easier to deal with than the\nlawyer.\"\n\n\"What can she have said to Miss Garth?\"\n\nCaptain Wragge considered a little.\n\n\"I can't say what Mrs. Lecount may have written,\" he said, \"but I can\ntell you what I should have written in Mrs. Lecount's place. I should\nhave frightened Miss Garth by false reports about you, to begin with,\nand then I should have asked for personal particulars, to help a\nbenevolent stranger in restoring you to your friends.\" The angry glitter\nflashed up instantly in Magdalen's eyes.\n\n\"What _you_ would have done is what Mrs. Lecount has done,\" she said,\nindignantly. \"Neither lawyer nor governess shall dispute my right to my\nown will and my own way. If Miss Garth thinks she can control my actions\nby corresponding with Mrs. Lecount, I will show Miss Garth she is\nmistaken! It is high time, Captain Wragge, to have done with these\nwretched risks of discovery. We will take the short way to the end we\nhave in view sooner than Mrs. Lecount or Miss Garth think for. How\nlong can you give me to wring an offer of marriage out of that creature\ndownstairs?\"\n\n\"I dare not give you long,\" replied Captain Wragge. \"Now your friends\nknow where you are, they may come down on us at a day's notice. Could\nyou manage it in a week?\"\n\n\"I'll manage it in half the time,\" she said, with a hard, defiant laugh.\n\"Leave us together this morning as you left us at Dunwich, and take Mrs.\nWragge with you, as an excuse for parting company. Is the paint dry yet?\nGo downstairs and tell him I am coming directly.\"\n\nSo, for the second time, Miss Garth's well-meant efforts defeated their\nown end. So the fatal force of circumstance turned the hand that would\nfain have held Magdalen back into the hand that drove her on.\n\nThe captain returned to his visitor in the parlor, after first stopping\non his way to issue his orders for the walking excursion to Mrs. Wragge.\n\n\"I am shocked to have kept you waiting,\" he said, sitting down again\nconfidentially by Noel Vanstone's side. \"My only excuse is, that my\nniece had accidentally dressed her hair so as to defeat our object. I\nhave been persuading her to alter it, and young ladies are apt to be a\nlittle obstinate on questions relating to their toilet. Give her a chair\non that side of you when she comes in, and take your look at her neck\ncomfortably before we start for our walk.\"\n\nMagdalen entered the room as he said those words, and after the first\ngreetings were exchanged, took the chair presented to her with the most\nunsuspicious readiness. Noel Vanstone applied the Crucial Test on the\nspot, with the highest appreciation of the fair material which was the\nsubject of experiment. Not the vestige of a mole was visible on any part\nof the smooth white surface of Miss Bygrave's neck. It mutely answered\nthe blinking inquiry of Noel Vanstone's half-closed eyes by the flattest\npractical contradiction of Mrs. Lecount. That one central incident in\nthe events of the morning was of all the incidents that had hitherto\noccurred, the most important in its results. That one discovery shook\nthe housekeeper's hold on her master as nothing had shaken it yet.\n\nIn a few minutes Mrs. Wragge made her appearance, and excited as much\nsurprise in Noel Vanstone's mind as he was capable of feeling while\nabsorbed in the enjoyment of Magdalen's society. The walking-party left\nthe house at once, directing their steps northward, so as not to\npass the windows of Sea-view Cottage. To Mrs. Wragge's unutterable\nastonishment, her husband, for the first time in the course of their\nmarried life, politely offered her his arm, and led her on in advance\nof the young people, as if the privilege of walking alone with her\npresented some special attraction to him! \"Step out!\" whispered the\ncaptain, fiercely. \"Leave your niece and Mr. Vanstone alone! If I catch\nyou looking back at them, I'll put the Oriental Cashmere Robe on the top\nof the kitchen fire! Turn your toes out, and keep step--confound you,\nkeep step!\" Mrs. Wragge kept step to the best of her limited ability.\nHer sturdy knees trembled under her. She firmly believed the captain was\nintoxicated.\n\nThe walk lasted for rather more than an hour. Before nine o'clock they\nwere all back again at North Shingles. The ladies went at once into the\nhouse. Noel Vanstone remained with Captain Wragge in the garden. \"Well,\"\nsaid the captain, \"what do you think now of Mrs. Lecount?\"\n\n\"Damn Lecount!\" replied Noel Vanstone, in great agitation. \"I'm half\ninclined to agree with you. I'm half inclined to think my infernal\nhousekeeper is mad.\"\n\nHe spoke fretfully and unwillingly, as if the merest allusion to Mrs.\nLecount was distasteful to him. His color came and went; his manner was\nabsent and undecided; he fidgeted restlessly about the garden walk.\nIt would have been plain to a far less acute observation than Captain\nWragge's, that Magdalen had met his advances by an unexpected grace\nand readiness of encouragement which had entirely overthrown his\nself-control.\n\n\"I never enjoyed a walk so much in my life!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden\noutburst of enthusiasm. \"I hope Miss Bygrave feels all the better, for\nit. Do you go out at the same time to-morrow morning? May I join you\nagain?\"\n\n\"By all means, Mr. Vanstone,\" said the Captain, cordially. \"Excuse me\nfor returning to the subject--but what do you propose saying to Mrs.\nLecount?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Lecount is a perfect nuisance! What would you do, Mr.\nBygrave, if you were in my place?\"\n\n\"Allow me to ask a question, my dear sir, before I tell you. What is\nyour breakfast-hour?\"\n\n\"Half-past nine.\"\n\n\"Is Mrs. Lecount an early riser?\"\n\n\"No. Lecount is lazy in the morning. I hate lazy women! If you were in\nmy place, what should you say to her?\"\n\n\"I should say nothing,\" replied Captain Wragge. \"I should return at once\nby the back way; I should let Mrs. Lecount see me in the front garden\nas if I was taking a turn before breakfast; and I should leave her to\nsuppose that I was only just out of my room. If she asks you whether you\nmean to come here today, say No. Secure a quiet life until circumstances\nforce you to give her an answer. Then tell the plain truth--say that Mr.\nBygrave's niece and Mrs. Lecount's description are at variance with each\nother in the most important particular, and beg that the subject may not\nbe mentioned again. There is my advice. What do you think of it?\"\n\nIf Noel Vanstone could have looked into his counselor's mind, he might\nhave thought the captain's advice excellently adapted to serve the\ncaptain's interests. As long as Mrs. Lecount could be kept in ignorance\nof her master's visits to North Shingles, so long she would wait until\nthe opportunity came for trying her experiment, and so long she might\nbe trusted not to endanger the conspiracy by any further proceedings.\nNecessarily incapable of viewing Captain Wragge's advice under this\naspect, Noel Vanstone simply looked at it as offering him a temporary\nmeans of escape from an explanation with his housekeeper. He eagerly\ndeclared that the course of action suggested to him should be followed\nto the letter, and returned to Sea View without further delay.\n\nOn this occasion Captain Wragge's anticipations were in no respect\nfalsified by Mrs. Lecount's conduct. She had no suspicion of her\nmaster's visit to North Shingles: she had made up her mind, if\nnecessary, to wait patiently for his interview with Miss Bygrave until\nthe end of the week; and she did not embarrass him by any unexpected\nquestions when he announced his intention of holding no personal\ncommunication with the Bygraves on that day. All she said was, \"Don't\nyou feel well enough, Mr. Noel? or don't you feel inclined?\" He\nanswered, shortly, \"I don't feel well enough\"; and there the\nconversation ended.\n\nThe next day the proceedings of the previous morning were exactly\nrepeated. This time Noel Vanstone went home rapturously with a keepsake\nin his breast-pocket; he had taken tender possession of one of Miss\nBygrave's gloves. At intervals during the day, whenever he was alone,\nhe took out the glove and kissed it with a devotion which was almost\npassionate in its fervor. The miserable little creature luxuriated in\nhis moments of stolen happiness with a speechless and stealthy delight\nwhich was a new sensation to him. The few young girls whom he had met\nwith, in his father's narrow circle at Zurich, had felt a mischievous\npleasure in treating him like a quaint little plaything; the strongest\nimpression he could make on their hearts was an impression in which\ntheir lap-dogs might have rivaled him; the deepest interest he could\ncreate in them was the interest they might have felt in a new trinket or\na new dress. The only women who had hitherto invited his admiration, and\ntaken his compliments seriously had been women whose charms were on\nthe wane, and whose chances of marriage were fast failing them. For\nthe first time in his life he had now passed hours of happiness in the\nsociety of a beautiful girl, who had left him to think of her afterward\nwithout a single humiliating remembrance to lower him in his own esteem.\n\nAnxiously as he tried to hide it, the change produced in his look and\nmanner by the new feeling awakened in him was not a change which could\nbe concealed from Mrs. Lecount. On the second day she pointedly asked\nhim whether he had not made an arrangement to call on the Bygraves.\nHe denied it as before. \"Perhaps you are going to-morrow, Mr. Noel?\"\npersisted the housekeeper. He was at the end of his resources; he was\nimpatient to be rid of her inquiries; he trusted to his friend at North\nShingles to help him; and this time he answered Yes. \"If you see the\nyoung lady,\" proceeded Mrs. Lecount, \"don't forget that note of mine,\nsir, which you have in your waistcoat-pocket.\" No more was said on\neither side, but by that night's post the housekeeper wrote to Miss\nGarth. The letter merely acknowledged, with thanks, the receipt of Miss\nGarth's communication, and informed her that in a few days Mrs. Lecount\nhoped to be in a position to write again and summon Mr. Pendril to\nAldborough.\n\nLate in the evening, when the parlor at North Shingles began to get\ndark, and when the captain rang the bell for candles as usual, he was\nsurprised by hearing Magdalen's voice in the passage telling the servant\nto take the lights downstairs again. She knocked at the door immediately\nafterward, and glided into the obscurity of the room like a ghost.\n\n\"I have a question to ask you about your plans for to-morrow,\" she said.\n\"My eyes are very weak this evening, and I hope you will not object to\ndispense with the candles for a few minutes.\"\n\nShe spoke in low, stifled tones, and felt her way noiselessly to a chair\nfar removed from the captain in the darkest part of the room. Sitting\nnear the window, he could just discern the dim outline of her dress, he\ncould just hear the faint accents of her voice. For the last two days\nhe had seen nothing of her except during their morning walk. On\nthat afternoon he had found his wife crying in the little backroom\ndown-stairs. She could only tell him that Magdalen had frightened\nher--that Magdalen was going the way again which she had gone when the\nletter came from China in the terrible past time at Vauxhall Walk.\n\n\"I was sorry to her that you were ill to-day, from Mrs. Wragge,\" said\nthe captain, unconsciously dropping his voice almost to a whisper as he\nspoke.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" she answered quietly, out of the darkness. \"I am\nstrong enough to suffer, and live. Other girls in my place would have\nbeen happier--they would have suffered, and died. It doesn't matter; it\nwill be all the same a hundred years hence. Is he coming again tomorrow\nmorning at seven o'clock?\"\n\n\"He is coming, if you feel no objection to it.\"\n\n\"I have no objection to make; I have done with objecting. But I should\nlike to have the time altered. I don't look my best in the early\nmorning---I have bad nights, and I rise haggard and worn. Write him a\nnote this evening, and tell him to come at twelve o'clock.\"\n\n\"Twelve is rather late, under the circumstances, for you to be seen out\nwalking.\"\n\n\"I have no intention of walking. Let him be shown into the parlor--\"\n\nHer voice died away in silence before she ended the sentence.\n\n\"Yes?\" said Captain Wragge.\n\n\"And leave me alone in the parlor to receive him.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said the captain. \"An admirable idea. I'll be out of the\nway in the dining-room while he is here, and you can come and tell me\nabout it when he has gone.\"\n\nThere was another moment of silence.\n\n\"Is there no way but telling you?\" she asked, suddenly. \"I can control\nmyself while he is with me, but I can't answer for what I may say or do\nafterward. Is there no other way?\"\n\n\"Plenty of ways,\" said the captain. \"Here is the first that occurs to\nme. Leave the blind down over the window of your room upstairs before\nhe comes. I will go out on the beach, and wait there within sight of the\nhouse. When I see him come out again, I will look at the window. If he\nhas said nothing, leave the blind down. If he has made you an\noffer, draw the blind up. The signal is simplicity itself; we can't\nmisunderstand each other. Look your best to-morrow! Make sure of him, my\ndear girl--make sure of him, if you possibly can.\"\n\nHe had spoken loud enough to feel certain that she had heard him, but no\nanswering word came from her. The dead silence was only disturbed by the\nrustling of her dress, which told him she had risen from her chair. Her\nshadowy presence crossed the room again; the door shut softly; she was\ngone. He rang the bell hurriedly for the lights. The servant found him\nstanding close at the window, looking less self-possessed than usual. He\ntold her he felt a little poorly, and sent her to the cupboard for the\nbrandy.\n\nAt a few minutes before twelve the next day Captain Wragge withdrew to\nhis post of observation, concealing himself behind a fishing-boat drawn\nup on the beach. Punctually as the hour struck, he saw Noel Vanstone\napproach North Shingles and open the garden gate. When the house door\nhad closed on the visitor, Captain Wragge settled himself comfortably\nagainst the side of the boat and lit his cigar.\n\nHe smoked for half an hour--for ten minutes over the half-hour, by his\nwatch. He finished the cigar down to the last morsel of it that he could\nhold in his lips. Just as he had thrown away the end, the door opened\nagain and Noel Vanstone came out.\n\nThe captain looked up instantly at Magdalen's window. In the absorbing\nexcitement of the moment, he counted the seconds. She might get from the\nparlor to her own room in less than a minute. He counted to thirty, and\nnothing happened. He counted to fifty, and nothing happened. He gave up\ncounting, and left the boat impatiently, to return to the house.\n\nAs he took his first step forward he saw the signal.\n\nThe blind was drawn up.\n\nCautiously ascending the eminence of the beach, Captain Wragge looked\ntoward Sea-view Cottage before he showed himself on the Parade. Noel\nVanstone had reached home again; he was just entering his own door.\n\n\"If all your money was offered me to stand in your shoes,\" said the\ncaptain, looking after him--\"rich as you are, I wouldn't take it!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nON returning to the house, Captain Wragge received a significant message\nfrom the servant. \"Mr. Noel Vanstone would call again at two o'clock\nthat afternoon, when he hoped to have the pleasure of finding Mr.\nBygrave at home.\"\n\nThe captain's first inquiry after hearing this message referred to\nMagdalen. \"Where was Miss Bygrave?\" \"In her own room.\" \"Where was Mrs.\nBygrave?\" \"In the back parlor.\" Captain Wragge turned his steps at once\nin the latter direction, and found his wife, for the second time, in\ntears. She had been sent out of Magdalen's room for the whole day,\nand she was at her wits' end to know what she had done to deserve it.\nShortening her lamentations without ceremony, her husband sent her\nupstairs on the spot, with instructions to knock at the door, and\nto inquire whether Magdalen could give five minutes' attention to a\nquestion of importance which must be settled before two o'clock.\n\nThe answer returned was in the negative. Magdalen requested that the\nsubject on which she was asked to decide might be mentioned to her in\nwriting. She engaged to reply in the same way, on the understanding that\nMrs. Wragge, and not the servant, should be employed to deliver the note\nand to take back the answer.\n\nCaptain Wragge forthwith opened his paper-case and wrote these lines:\n\"Accept my warmest congratulations on the result of your interview\nwith Mr. N. V. He is coming again at two o'clock--no doubt to make his\nproposals in due form. The question to decide is, whether I shall press\nhim or not on the subject of settlements. The considerations for your\nown mind are two in number. First, whether the said pressure (without at\nall underrating your influence over him) may not squeeze for a long\ntime before it squeezes money out of Mr. N. V. Secondly, whether we are\naltogether justified--considering our present position toward a certain\nsharp practitioner in petticoats--in running the risk of delay. Consider\nthese points, and let me have your decision as soon as convenient.\"\n\nThe answer returned to this note was written in crooked, blotted\ncharacters, strangely unlike Magdalen's usually firm and clear\nhandwriting. It only contained these words: \"Give yourself no trouble\nabout settlements. Leave the use to which he is to put his money for the\nfuture in my hands.\"\n\n\"Did you see her?\" asked the captain, when his wife had delivered the\nanswer.\n\n\"I tried,\" said Mrs. Wragge, with a fresh burst of tears--\"but she only\nopened the door far enough to put out her hand. I took and gave it a\nlittle squeeze--and, oh poor soul, it felt so cold in mine!\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Lecount's master made his appearance at two o'clock, he stood\nalarmingly in need of an anodyne application from Mrs. Lecount's green\nfan. The agitation of making his avowal to Magdalen; the terror of\nfinding himself discovered by the housekeeper; the tormenting suspicion\nof the hard pecuniary conditions which Magdalen's relative and guardian\nmight impose on him--all these emotions, stirring in conflict together,\nhad overpowered his feebly-working heart with a trial that strained\nit sorely. He gasped for breath as he sat down in the parlor at North\nShingles, and that ominous bluish pallor which always overspread his\nface in moments of agitation now made its warning appearance again.\nCaptain Wragge seized the brandy bottle in genuine alarm, and forced his\nvisitor to drink a wine-glassful of the spirit before a word was said\nbetween them on either side.\n\nRestored by the stimulant, and encouraged by the readiness with which\nthe captain anticipated everything that he had to say, Noel Vanstone\ncontrived to state the serious object of his visit in tolerably plain\nterms. All the conventional preliminaries proper to the occasion were\neasily disposed of. The suitor's family was respectable; his position\nin life was undeniably satisfactory; his attachment, though hasty, was\nevidently disinterested and sincere. All that Captain Wragge had to\ndo was to refer to these various considerations with a happy choice of\nlanguage in a voice that trembled with manly emotion, and this he did\nto perfection. For the first half-hour of the interview, no allusion\nwhatever was made to the delicate and dangerous part of the subject. The\ncaptain waited until he had composed his visitor, and when that result\nwas achieved came smoothly to the point in these terms:\n\n\"There is one little difficulty, Mr. Vanstone, which I think we have\nboth overlooked. Your housekeeper's recent conduct inclines me to fear\nthat she will view the approaching change in your life with anything but\na friendly eye. Probably you have not thought it necessary yet to inform\nher of the new tie which you propose to form?\"\n\nNoel Vanstone turned pale at the bare idea of explaining himself to Mrs.\nLecount.\n\n\"I can't tell what I'm to do,\" he said, glancing aside nervously at the\nwindow, as if he expected to see the housekeeper peeping in. \"I hate all\nawkward positions, and this is the most unpleasant position I ever was\nplaced in. You don't know what a terrible woman Lecount is. I'm not\nafraid of her; pray don't suppose I'm afraid of her--\"\n\nAt those words his fears rose in his throat, and gave him the lie direct\nby stopping his utterance.\n\n\"Pray don't trouble yourself to explain,\" said Captain Wragge, coming to\nthe rescue. \"This is the common story, Mr. Vanstone. Here is a woman who\nhas grown old in your service, and in your father's service before you;\na woman who has contrived, in all sorts of small, underhand ways, to\npresume systematically on her position for years and years past; a\nwoman, in short, whom your inconsiderate but perfectly natural kindness\nhas allowed to claim a right of property in you--\"\n\n\"Property!\" cried Noel Vanstone, mistaking the captain, and letting\nthe truth escape him through sheer inability to conceal his fears any\nlonger. \"I don't know what amount of property she won't claim. She'll\nmake me pay for my father as well as for myself. Thousands, Mr.\nBygrave--thousands of pounds sterling out of my pocket!!!\" He clasped\nhis hands in despair at the picture of pecuniary compulsion which his\nfancy had conjured up--his own golden life-blood spouting from him in\ngreat jets of prodigality, under the lancet of Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Gently, Mr. Vanstone--gently! The woman knows nothing so far, and the\nmoney is not gone yet.\"\n\n\"No, no; the money is not gone, as you say. I'm only nervous about it;\nI can't help being nervous. You were saying something just now; you were\ngoing to give me advice. I value your advice; you don't know how highly\nI value your advice.\" He said those words with a conciliatory smile\nwhich was more than helpless; it was absolutely servile in its\ndependence on his judicious friend.\n\n\"I was only assuring you, my dear sir, that I understood your position,\"\nsaid the captain. \"I see your difficulty as plainly as you can see it\nyourself. Tell a woman like Mrs. Lecount that she must come off her\ndomestic throne, to make way for a young and beautiful successor,\narmed with the authority of a wife, and an unpleasant scene must be the\ninevitable result. An unpleasant scene, Mr. Vanstone, if your opinion of\nyour housekeeper's sanity is well founded. Something far more serious,\nif my opinion that her intellect is unsettled happens to turn out the\nright one.\"\n\n\"I don't say it isn't my opinion, too,\" rejoined Noel Vanstone.\n\"Especially after what has happened to-day.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge immediately begged to know what the event alluded to\nmight be.\n\nNoel Vanstone thereupon explained--with an infinite number of\nparentheses all referring to himself--that Mrs. Lecount had put the\ndreaded question relating to the little note in her master's pocket\nbarely an hour since. He had answered her inquiry as Mr. Bygrave had\nadvised him. On hearing that the accuracy of the personal description\nhad been fairly put to the test, and had failed in the one important\nparticular of the moles on the neck, Mrs. Lecount had considered a\nlittle, and had then asked him whether he had shown her note to\nMr. Bygrave before the experiment was tried. He had answered in the\nnegative, as the only safe form of reply that he could think of on the\nspur of the moment, and the housekeeper had then addressed him in these\nstrange and startling words: \"You are keeping the truth from me, Mr.\nNoel. You are trusting strangers, and doubting your old servant and your\nold friend. Every time you go to Mr. Bygrave's house, every time you\nsee Miss Bygrave, you are drawing nearer and nearer to your destruction.\nThey have got the bandage over your eyes in spite of me; but I tell\nthem, and tell you, before many days are over I will take it off!\" To\nthis extraordinary outbreak--accompanied as it was by an expression in\nMrs. Lecount's face which he had never seen there before--Noel Vanstone\nhad made no reply. Mr. Bygrave's conviction that there was a lurking\ntaint of insanity in the housekeeper's blood had recurred to his\nmemory, and he had left the room at the first opportunity.\n\nCaptain Wragge listened with the closest attention to the narrative thus\npresented to him. But one conclusion could be drawn from it--it was a\nplain warning to him to hasten the end.\n\n\"I am not surprised,\" he said, gravely, \"to hear that you are inclining\nmore favorably to my opinion. After what you have just told me, Mr.\nVanstone, no sensible man could do otherwise. This is becoming\nserious. I hardly know what results may not be expected to follow the\ncommunication of your approaching change in life to Mrs. Lecount. My\nniece may be involved in those results. She is nervous; she is sensitive\nin the highest degree; she is the innocent object of this woman's\nunreasoning hatred and distrust. You alarm me, sir! I am not easily\nthrown off my balance, but I acknowledge you alarm me for the future.\"\nHe frowned, shook his head, and looked at his visitor despondently.\n\nNoel Vanstone began to feel uneasy. The change in Mr. Bygrave's manner\nseemed ominous of a reconsideration of his proposals from a new and\nunfavorable point of view. He took counsel of his inborn cowardice and\nhis inborn cunning, and proposed a solution of the difficulty discovered\nby himself.\n\n\"Why should we tell Lecount at all?\" he asked. \"What right has Lecount\nto know? Can't we be married without letting her into the secret? And\ncan't somebody tell her afterward when we are both out of her reach?\"\n\nCaptain Wragge received this proposal with an expression of surprise\nwhich did infinite credit to his power of control over his own\ncountenance. His foremost object throughout the interview had been to\nconduct it to this point, or, in other words, to make the first idea\nof keeping the marriage a secret from Mrs. Lecount emanate from Noel\nVanstone instead of from himself. No one knew better than the captain\nthat the only responsibilities which a weak man ever accepts are\nresponsibilities which can be perpetually pointed out to him as resting\nexclusively on his own shoulders.\n\n\"I am accustomed to set my face against clandestine proceedings of all\nkinds,\" said Captain Wragge. \"But there are exceptions to the strictest\nrules; and I am bound to admit, Mr. Vanstone, that your position in this\nmatter is an exceptional position, if ever there was one yet. The course\nyou have just proposed--however unbecoming I may think it, however\ndistasteful it may be to myself--would not only spare you a very serious\nembarrassment (to say the least of it), but would also protect you from\nthe personal assertion of those pecuniary claims on the part of your\nhousekeeper to which you have already adverted. These are both desirable\nresults to achieve--to say nothing of the removal, on my side, of all\napprehension of annoyance to my niece. On the other hand, however, a\nmarriage solemnized with such privacy as you propose must be a hasty\nmarriage; for, as we are situated, the longer the delay the greater will\nbe the risk that our secret may escape our keeping. I am not against\nhasty marriages where a mutual flame is fanned by an adequate income.\nMy own was a love-match contracted in a hurry. There are plenty of\ninstances in the experience of every one, of short courtships and speedy\nmarriages, which have turned up trumps--I beg your pardon--which have\nturned out well after all. But if you and my niece, Mr. Vanstone, are\nto add one to the number of these eases, the usual preliminaries of\nmarriage among the higher classes must be hastened by some means. You\ndoubtless understand me as now referring to the subject of settlements.\"\n\n\"I'll take another teaspoonful of brandy,\" said Noel Vanstone, holding\nout his glass with a trembling hand as the word \"settlements\" passed\nCaptain Wragge's lips.\n\n\"I'll take a teaspoonful with you,\" said the captain, nimbly dismounting\nfrom the pedestal of his respectability, and sipping his brandy with\nthe highest relish. Noel Vanstone, after nervously following his host's\nexample, composed himself to meet the coming ordeal, with reclining\nhead and grasping hands, in the position familiarly associated to all\ncivilized humanity with a seat in a dentist's chair.\n\nThe captain put down his empty glass and got up again on his pedestal.\n\n\"We were talking of settlements,\" he resumed. \"I have already mentioned,\nMr. Vanstone, at an early period of our conversation, that my niece\npresents the man of her choice with no other dowry than the most\ninestimable of all gifts--the gift of herself. This circumstance,\nhowever (as you are no doubt aware), does not disentitle me to make the\ncustomary stipulations with her future husband. According to the usual\ncourse in this matter, my lawyer would see yours--consultations would\ntake place--delays would occur--strangers would be in possession of\nyour intentions--and Mrs. Lecount would, sooner or later, arrive at that\nknowledge of the truth which you are anxious to keep from her. Do you\nagree with me so far?\"\n\nUnutterable apprehension closed Noel Vanstone's lips. He could only\nreply by an inclination of the head.\n\n\"Very good,\" said the captain. \"Now, sir, you may possibly have observed\nthat I am a man of a very original turn of mind. If I have not hitherto\nstruck you in that light, it may then be necessary to mention that there\nare some subjects on which I persist in thinking for myself. The subject\nof marriage settlements is one of them. What, let me ask you, does a\nparent or guardian in my present condition usually do? After having\ntrusted the man whom he has chosen for his son-in-law with the sacred\ndeposit of a woman's happiness, he turns round on that man, and declines\nto trust him with the infinitely inferior responsibility of providing\nfor her pecuniary future. He fetters his son-in-law with the most\nbinding document the law can produce, and employs with the husband of\nhis own child the same precautions which he would use if he were dealing\nwith a stranger and a rogue. I call such conduct as this inconsistent\nand unbecoming in the last degree. You will not find it my course of\nconduct, Mr. Vanstone--you will not find me preaching what I don't\npractice. If I trust you with my niece, I trust you with every inferior\nresponsibility toward her and toward me. Give me your hand, sir; tell\nme, on your word of honor, that you will provide for your wife as\nbecomes her position and your means, and the question of settlements is\ndecided between us from this moment at once and forever!\" Having carried\nout Magdalen's instructions in this lofty tone, he threw open his\nrespectable frockcoat, and sat with head erect and hand extended, the\nmodel of parental feeling and the picture of human integrity.\n\nFor one moment Noel Vanstone remained literally petrified by\nastonishment. The next, he started from his chair and wrung the hand of\nhis magnanimous friend in a perfect transport of admiration. Never yet,\nthroughout his long and varied career, had Captain Wragge felt such\ndifficulty in keeping his countenance as he felt now. Contempt for the\noutburst of miserly gratitude of which he was the object; triumph in the\nsense of successful conspiracy against a man who had rated the offer\nof his protection at five pounds; regret at the lost opportunity\nof effecting a fine stroke of moral agriculture, which his dread of\ninvolving himself in coming consequences had forced him to let slip--all\nthese varied emotions agitated the captain's mind; all strove together\nto find their way to the surface through the outlets of his face or his\ntongue. He allowed Noel Vanstone to keep possession of his hand, and to\nheap one series of shrill protestations and promises on another, until\nhe had regained his usual mastery over himself. That result achieved,\nhe put the little man back in his chair, and returned forthwith to the\nsubject of Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Suppose we now revert to the difficulty which we have not conquered\nyet,\" said the captain. \"Let us say that I do violence to my own habits\nand feelings; that I allow the considerations I have already mentioned\nto weigh with me; and that I sanction your wish to be united to my niece\nwithout the knowledge of Mrs. Lecount. Allow me to inquire in that case\nwhat means you can suggest for the accomplishment of your end?\"\n\n\"I can't suggest anything,\" replied Noel Vanstone, helplessly. \"Would\nyou object to suggest for me?\"\n\n\"You are making a bolder request than you think, Mr. Vanstone. I never\ndo things by halves. When I am acting with my customary candor, I am\nfrank (as you know already) to the utmost verge of imprudence. When\nexceptional circumstances compel me to take an opposite course, there\nisn't a slyer fox alive than I am. If, at your express request, I take\noff my honest English coat here and put on a Jesuit's gown--if, purely\nout of sympathy for your awkward position, I consent to keep your secret\nfor you from Mrs. Lecount--I must have no unseasonable scruples to\ncontend with on your part. If it is neck or nothing on my side, sir, it\nmust be neck or nothing on yours also.\"\n\n\"Neck or nothing, by all means,\" said Noel Vanstone, briskly--\"on\nthe understanding that you go first. I have no scruples about keeping\nLecount in the dark. But she is devilish cunning, Mr. Bygrave. How is it\nto be done?\"\n\n\"You shall hear directly,\" replied the captain. \"Before I develop my\nviews, I should like to have your opinion on an abstract question of\nmorality. What do you think, my dear sir, of pious frauds in general?\"\n\nNoel Vanstone looked a little embarrassed by the question.\n\n\"Shall I put it more plainly?\" continued Captain Wragge. \"What do you\nsay to the universally-accepted maxim that 'all stratagems are fair in\nlove and war'?--Yes or No?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" answered Noel Vanstone, with the utmost readiness.\n\n\"One more question and I have done,\" said the captain. \"Do you see any\nparticular objection to practicing a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount?\"\n\nNoel Vanstone's resolution began to falter a little.\n\n\"Is Lecount likely to find it out?\" he asked cautiously.\n\n\"She can't possibly discover it until you are married and out of her\nreach.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure.\"\n\n\"Play any trick you like on Lecount,\" said Noel Vanstone, with an air of\nunutterable relief. \"I have had my suspicions lately that she is trying\nto domineer over me; I am beginning to feel that I have borne with\nLecount long enough. I wish I was well rid of her.\"\n\n\"You shall have your wish,\" said Captain Wragge. \"You shall be rid of\nher in a week or ten days.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone rose eagerly and approached the captain's chair.\n\n\"You don't say so!\" he exclaimed. \"How do you mean to send her away?\"\n\n\"I mean to send her on a journey,\" replied Captain Wragge.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"From your house at Aldborough to her brother's bedside at Zurich.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone started back at the answer, and returned suddenly to his\nchair.\n\n\"How can you do that?\" he inquired, in the greatest perplexity. \"Her\nbrother (hang him!) is much better. She had another letter from Zurich\nto say so, this morning.\"\n\n\"Did you see the letter?\"\n\n\"Yes. She always worries about her brother--she _would_ show it to me.\"\n\n\"Who was it from? and what did it say?\"\n\n\"It was from the doctor--he always writes to her. I don't care two\nstraws about her brother, and I don't remember much of the letter,\nexcept that it was a short one. The fellow was much better; and if the\ndoctor didn't write again, she might take it for granted that he was\ngetting well. That was the substance of it.\"\n\n\"Did you notice where she put the letter when you gave it her back\nagain?\"\n\n\"Yes. She put it in the drawer where she keeps her account-books.\"\n\n\"Can you get at that drawer?\"\n\n\"Of course I can. I have got a duplicate key--I always insist on a\nduplicate key of the place where she keeps her account books. I never\nallow the account-books to be locked up from my inspection: it's a rule\nof the house.\"\n\n\"Be so good as to get that letter to-day, Mr. Vanstone, without your\nhousekeeper's knowledge, and add to the favor by letting me have it here\nprivately for an hour or two.\"\n\n\"What do you want it for?\"\n\n\"I have some more questions to ask before I tell you. Have you any\nintimate friend at Zurich whom you could trust to help you in playing a\ntrick on Mrs. Lecount?\"\n\n\"What sort of help do you mean?\" asked Noel Vanstone.\n\n\"Suppose,\" said the captain, \"you were to send a letter addressed to\nMrs. Lecount at Aldborough, inclosed in another letter addressed to one\nof your friends abroad? And suppose you were to instruct that friend\nto help a harmless practical joke by posting Mrs. Lecount's letter at\nZurich? Do you know any one who could be trusted to do that?\"\n\n\"I know two people who could be trusted!\" cried Noel Vanstone. \"Both\nladies--both spinsters--both bitter enemies of Lecount's. But what is\nyour drift, Mr. Bygrave? Though I am not usually wanting in penetration,\nI don't altogether see your drift.\"\n\n\"You shall see it directly, Mr. Vanstone.\"\n\nWith those words he rose, withdrew to his desk in the corner of the\nroom, and wrote a few lines on a sheet of note-paper. After first\nreading them carefully to himself, he beckoned to Noel Vanstone to come\nand read them too.\n\n\"A few minutes since,\" said the captain, pointing complacently to his\nown composition with the feather end of his pen, \"I had the honor of\nsuggesting a pious fraud on Mrs. Lecount. There it is!\"\n\nHe resigned his chair at the writing-table to his visitor. Noel Vanstone\nsat down, and read these lines:\n\n\n\"MY DEAR MADAM--Since I last wrote, I deeply regret to inform you that\nyour brother has suffered a relapse. The symptoms are so serious, that\nit is my painful duty to summon you instantly to his bedside. I am\nmaking every effort to resist the renewed progress of the malady, and I\nhave not yet lost all hope of success. But I cannot reconcile it to my\nconscience to leave you in ignorance of a serious change in my patient\nfor the worse, which _may_ be attended by fatal results. With much\nsympathy, I remain, etc. etc.\"\n\n\nCaptain Wragge waited with some anxiety for the effect which this letter\nmight produce. Mean, selfish, and cowardly as he was, even Noel Vanstone\nmight feel some compunction at practicing such a deception as was\nhere suggested on a woman who stood toward him in the position of Mrs.\nLecount. She had served him faithfully, however interested her motives\nmight be--she had lived since he was a lad in the full possession of his\nfather's confidence--she was living now under the protection of his own\nroof. Could be fail to remember this; and, remembering it, could he lend\nhis aid without hesitation to the scheme which was now proposed to him?\nCaptain Wragge unconsciously retained belief enough in human nature to\ndoubt it. To his surprise, and, it must be added, to his relief, also,\nhis apprehensions proved to be groundless. The only emotions aroused in\nNoel Vanstone's mind by a perusal of the letter were a hearty admiration\nof his friend's idea, and a vainglorious anxiety to claim the credit to\nhimself of being the person who carried it out. Examples may be found\nevery day of a fool who is no coward; examples may be found occasionally\nof a fool who is not cunning; but it may reasonably be doubted whether\nthere is a producible instance anywhere of a fool who is not cruel.\n\n\"Perfect!\" cried Noel Vanstone, clapping his hands. \"Mr. Bygrave, you\nare as good as Figaro in the French comedy. Talking of French, there is\none serious mistake in this clever letter of yours--it is written in the\nwrong language. When the doctor writes to Lecount, he writes in French.\nPerhaps you meant me to translate it? You can't manage without my help,\ncan you? I write French as fluently as I write English. Just look at me!\nI'll translate it, while I sit here, in two strokes of the pen.\"\n\nHe completed the translation almost as rapidly as Captain Wragge had\nproduced the original. \"Wait a minute!\" he cried, in high critical\ntriumph at discovering another defect in the composition of his\ningenious friend. \"The doctor always dates his letters. Here is no date\nto yours.\"\n\n\"I leave the date to you,\" said the captain, with a sardonic smile. \"You\nhave discovered the fault, my dear sir--pray correct it!\"\n\nNoel Vanstone mentally looked into the great gulf which separates the\nfaculty that can discover a defect, from the faculty that can apply\na remedy, and, following the example of many a wiser man, declined to\ncross over it.\n\n\"I couldn't think of ta king the liberty,\" he said, politely. \"Perhaps\nyou had a motive for leaving the date out?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I had,\" replied Captain Wragge, with his easiest good-humor.\n\"The date must depend on the time a letter takes to get to Zurich. _I_\nhave had no experience on that point--_you_ must have had plenty\nof experience in your father's time. Give me the benefit of\nyour information, and we will add the date before you leave the\nwriting-table.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone's experience was, as Captain Wragge had anticipated,\nperfectly competent to settle the question of time. The railway\nresources of the Continent (in the year eighteen hundred and\nforty-seven) were but scanty; and a letter sent at that period from\nEngland to Zurich, and from Zurich back again to England, occupied ten\ndays in making the double journey by post.\n\n\"Date the letter in French five days on from to-morrow,\" said the\ncaptain, when he had got his information. \"Very good. The next thing is\nto let me have the doctor's note as soon as you can. I may be obliged\nto practice some hours before I can copy your translation in an\nexact imitation of the doctor's handwriting. Have you got any foreign\nnote-paper? Let me have a few sheets, and send, at the same time, an\nenvelope addressed to one of those lady-friends of yours at Zurich,\naccompanied by the necessary request to post the inclosure. This is all\nI need trouble you to do, Mr. Vanstone. Don't let me seem inhospitable;\nbut the sooner you can supply me with my materials, the better I\nshall be pleased. We entirely understand each other, I suppose? Having\naccepted your proposal for my niece's hand, I sanction a private\nmarriage in consideration of the circumstances on your side. A little\nharmless stratagem is necessary to forward your views. I invent the\nstratagem at your request, and you make use of it without the least\nhesitation. The result is, that in ten days from to-morrow Mrs. Lecount\nwill be on her way to Switzerland; in fifteen days from to-morrow Mrs.\nLecount will reach Zurich, and discover the trick we have played her; in\ntwenty days from to-morrow Mrs. Lecount will be back at Aldborough,\nand will find her master's wedding-cards on the table, and her master\nhimself away on his honey-moon trip. I put it arithmetically, for the\nsake of putting it plain. God bless you. Good-morning!\"\n\n\"I suppose I may have the happiness of seeing Miss Bygrave to-morrow?\"\nsaid Noel Vanstone, turning round at the door.\n\n\"We must be careful,\" replied Captain Wragge. \"I don't forbid to-morrow,\nbut I make no promise beyond that. Permit me to remind you that we have\ngot Mrs. Lecount to manage for the next ten days.\"\n\n\"I wish Lecount was at the bottom of the German Ocean!\" exclaimed Noel\nVanstone, fervently. \"It's all very well for you to manage her--you\ndon't live in the house. What am I to do?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you to-morrow,\" said the captain. \"Go out for your walk\nalone, and drop in here, as you dropped in to-day, at two o'clock. In\nthe meantime, don't forget those things I want you to send me. Seal\nthem up together in a large envelope. When you have done that, ask Mrs.\nLecount to walk out with you as usual; and while she is upstairs\nputting her bonnet on, send the servant across to me. You understand?\nGood-morning.\"\n\nAn hour afterward, the sealed envelope, with its inclosures, reached\nCaptain Wragge in perfect safety. The double task of exactly imitating a\nstrange handwriting, and accurately copying words written in a language\nwith which he was but slightly acquainted, presented more difficulties\nto be overcome than the captain had anticipated. It was eleven\no'clock before the employment which he had undertaken was successfully\ncompleted, and the letter to Zurich ready for the post.\n\nBefore going to bed, he walked out on the deserted Parade to breathe the\ncool night air. All the lights were extinguished in Sea-view Cottage,\nwhen he looked that way, except the light in the housekeeper's window.\nCaptain Wragge shook his head suspiciously. He had gained experience\nenough by this time to distrust the wakefulness of Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nIF Captain Wragge could have looked into Mrs. Lecount's room while he\nstood on the Parade watching the light in her window, he would have seen\nthe housekeeper sitting absorbed in meditation over a worthless little\nmorsel of brown stuff which lay on her toilet-table.\n\nHowever exasperating to herself the conclusion might be, Mrs. Lecount\ncould not fail to see that she had been thus far met and baffled\nsuccessfully at every point. What was she to do next? If she sent for\nMr. Pendril when he came to Aldborough (with only a few hours spared\nfrom his business at her disposal), what definite course would there be\nfor him to follow? If she showed Noel Vanstone the original letter from\nwhich her note had been copied, he would apply instantly to the writer\nfor an explanation: would expose the fabricated story by which Mrs.\nLecount had succeeded in imposing on Miss Garth; and would, in any\nevent, still declare, on the evidence of his own eyes, that the test\nby the marks on the neck had utterly failed. Miss Vanstone, the elder,\nwhose unexpected presence at Aldborough might have done wonders--whose\nvoice in the hall at North Shingles, even if she had been admitted\nno further, might have reached her sister's ears and led to instant\nresults--Miss Vanstone, the elder, was out of the country, and was not\nlikely to return for a month at least. Look as anxiously as Mrs. Lecount\nmight along the course which she had hitherto followed, she failed\nto see her way through the accumulated obstacles which now barred her\nadvance.\n\nOther women in this position might have waited until circumstances\naltered, and helped them. Mrs. Lecount boldly retraced her steps, and\ndetermined to find her way to her end in a new direction. Resigning for\nthe present all further attempt to prove that the false Miss Bygrave was\nthe true Magdalen Vanstone, she resolved to narrow the range of her next\nefforts; to leave the actual question of Magdalen's identity untouched;\nand to rest satisfied with convincing her master of this simple\nfact--that the young lady who was charming him at North Shingles, and\nthe disguised woman who had terrified him in Vauxhall Walk, were one and\nthe same person.\n\nThe means of effecting this new object were, to all appearance, far less\neasy of attainment than the means of effecting the object which Mrs.\nLecount had just resigned. Here no help was to be expected from others,\nno ostensibly benevolent motives could be put forward as a blind--no\nappeal could be made to Mr. Pendril or to Miss Garth. Here the\nhousekeeper's only chance of success depended, in the first place, on\nher being able to effect a stolen entrance into Mr. Bygrave's house,\nand, in the second place, on her ability to discover whether that\nmemorable alpaca dress from which she had secretly cut the fragment of\nstuff happened to form part of Miss Bygrave's wardrobe.\n\nTaking the difficulties now before her in their order as they occurred,\nMrs. Lecount first resolved to devote the next few days to watching the\nhabits of the inmates of North Shingles, from early in the morning to\nlate at night, and to testing the capacity of the one servant in the\nhouse to resist the temptation of a bribe. Assuming that results proved\nsuccessful, and that, either by money or by stratagem, she gained\nadmission to North Shingles (without the knowledge of Mr. Bygrave or\nhis niece), she turned next to the second difficulty of the two--the\ndifficulty of obtaining access to Miss Bygrave's wardrobe.\n\nIf the servant proved corruptible, all obstacles in this direction might\nbe considered as removed beforehand. But if the servant proved honest,\nthe new problem was no easy one to solve.\n\nLong and careful consideration of the question led the housekeeper at\nlast to the bold resolution of obtaining an interview--if the servant\nfailed her--with Mrs. Bygrave herself. What was the true cause of this\nlady's mysterious seclusion? Was she a person of the strictest and the\nmost inconvenient integrity? or a person who could not be depended\non to preserve a secret? or a person who was as artful as Mr. Bygrave\nhimself, and who was kept in reserve to forward the object of some new\ndeception which was yet to come? In the first two cases, Mrs. Lecount\ncould trust in her own powers of dissimulation, and in the results which\nthey might achieve. In the last case (if no other end was gained), it\nmight be of vital importance to her to discover an enemy hidden in the\ndark. In any event, she determined to run the risk. Of the three\nchances in her favor on which she had reckoned at the outset of the\nstruggle--the chance of entrapping Magdalen by word of mouth, the\nchance of entrapping her by the help of her friends, and the chance of\nentrapping her by means of Mrs. Bygrave--two had been tried, and two\nhad failed. The third remained to be tested yet; and the third might\nsucceed.\n\nSo, the captain's enemy plotted against him in the privacy of her own\nchamber, while the captain watched the light in her window from the\nbeach outside.\n\n\nBefore breakfast the next morning, Captain Wragge posted the forged\nletter to Zurich with his own hand. He went back to North Shingles\nwith his mind not quite decided on the course to take with Mrs. Lecount\nduring the all-important interval of the next ten days.\n\nGreatly to his surprise, his doubts on this point were abruptly decided\nby Magdalen herself.\n\nHe found her waiting for him in the room where the breakfast was laid.\nShe was walking restlessly to and fro, with her head drooping on her\nbosom and her hair hanging disordered over her shoulders. The moment she\nlooked up on his entrance, the captain felt the fear which Mrs. Wragge\nhad felt before him--the fear that her mind would be struck prostrate\nagain, as it had been struck once already, when Frank's letter reached\nher in Vauxhall Walk.\n\n\"Is he coming again to-day?\" she asked, pushing away from her the chair\nwhich Captain Wragge offered, with such violence that she threw it on\nthe floor.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the captain, wisely answering her in the fewest words. \"He\nis coming at two o'clock.\"\n\n\"Take me away!\" she exclaimed, tossing her hair back wildly from her\nface. \"Take me away before he comes. I can't get over the horror of\nmarrying him while I am in this hateful place; take me somewhere where\nI can forget it, or I shall go mad! Give me two days' rest--two days out\nof sight of that horrible sea--two days out of prison in this horrible\nhouse--two days anywhere in the wide world away from Aldborough. I'll\ncome back with you! I'll go through with it to the end! Only give me two\ndays' escape from that man and everything belonging to him! Do you hear,\nyou villain?\" she cried, seizing his arm and shaking it in a frenzy of\npassion; \"I have been tortured enough--I can bear it no longer!\"\n\nThere was but one way of quieting her, and the captain instantly took\nit.\n\n\"If you will try to control yourself,\" he said, \"you shall leave\nAldborough in an hour's time.\"\n\nShe dropped his arm, and leaned back heavily against the wall behind\nher.\n\n\"I'll try,\" she answered, struggling for breath, but looking at him less\nwildly. \"You shan't complain of me, if I can help it.\" She attempted\nconfusedly to take her handkerchief from her apron pocket, and failed\nto find it. The captain took it out for her. Her eyes softened, and she\ndrew her breath more freely as she received the handkerchief from him.\n\"You are a kinder man than I thought you were,\" she said; \"I am sorry I\nspoke so passionately to you just now--I am very, very sorry.\" The tears\nstole into her eyes, and she offered him her hand with the native grace\nand gentleness of happier days. \"Be friends with me again,\" she said,\npleadingly. \"I'm only a girl, Captain Wragge--I'm only a girl!\"\n\nHe took her hand in silence, patted it for a moment, and then opened the\ndoor for her to go back to her own room again. There was genuine regret\nin his face as he showed her that trifling attention. He was a vagabond\nand a cheat; he had lived a mean, shuffling, degraded life, but he was\nhuman; and she had found her way to the lost sympathies in him which\nnot even the self-profanation of a swindler's existence could wholly\ndestroy. \"Damn the breakfast!\" he said, when the servant came in for her\norders. \"Go to the inn directly, and say I want a carriage and pair at\nthe door in an hour's time.\" He went out into the passage, still chafing\nunder a sense of mental disturbance which was new to him, and shouted\nto his wife more fiercely than ever--\"Pack up what we want for a week's\nabsence, and be ready in half an hour!\" Having issued those directions,\nhe returned to the breakfast-room, and looked at the half-spread table\nwith an impatient wonder at his disinclination to do justice to his own\nmeal. \"She has rubbed off the edge of my appetite,\" he said to himself,\nwith a forced laugh. \"I'll try a cigar, and a turn in the fresh air.\"\n\nIf he had been twenty years younger, those remedies might have failed\nhim. But where is the man to be found whose internal policy succumbs\nto revolution when that man is on the wrong side of fifty? Exercise and\nchange of place gave the captain back into the possession of himself.\nHe recovered the lost sense of the flavor of his cigar, and recalled\nhis wandering attention to the question of his approaching absence\nfrom Aldborough. A few minutes' consideration satisfied his mind that\nMagdalen's outbreak had forced him to take the course of all others\nwhich, on a fair review of existing emergencies, it was now most\ndesirable to adopt.\n\nCaptain Wragge's inquiries on the evening when he and Magdalen had\ndrunk tea at Sea View had certainly informed him that the housekeeper's\nbrother possessed a modest competence; that his sister was his nearest\nliving relative; and that there were some unscrupulous cousins on the\nspot who were anxious to usurp the place in his will which properly\nbelonged to Mrs. Lecount. Here were strong motives to take the\nhousekeeper to Zurich when the false report of her brother's relapse\nreached England. But if any idea of Noel Vanstone's true position dawned\non her in the meantime, who could say whether she might not, at the\neleventh hour, prefer asserting her large pecuniary interest in her\nmaster, to defending her small pecuniary interest at her brother's\nbedside? While that question remained undecided, the plain necessity of\nchecking the growth of Noel Vanstone's intimacy with the family at North\nShingles did not admit of a doubt; and of all means of effecting that\nobject, none could be less open to suspicion than the temporary\nremoval of the household from their residence at Aldborough. Thoroughly\nsatisfied with the soundness of this conclusion, Captain Wragge made\nstraight for Sea-view Cottage, to apologize and explain before the\ncarriage came and the departure took place.\n\nNoel Vanstone was easily accessible to visitors; he was walking in the\ngarden before breakfast. His disappointment and vexation were freely\nexpressed when he heard the news which his friend had to communicate.\nThe captain's fluent tongue, however, soon impressed on him the\nnecessity of resignation to present circumstances. The bare hint that\nthe \"pious fraud\" might fail after all, if anything happened in the\nten days' interval to enlighten Mrs. Lecount, had an instant effect in\nmaking Noel Vanstone as patient and as submissive as could be wished.\n\n\"I won't tell you where we are going, for two good reasons,\" said\nCaptain Wragge, when his preliminary explanations were completed. \"In\nthe first place, I haven't made up my mind yet; and, in the second\nplace, if you don't know where our destination is, Mrs. Lecount can't\nworm it out of you. I have not the least doubt she is watching us at\nthis moment from behind her window-curtain. When she asks what I wanted\nwith you this morning, tell her I came to say good-by for a few days,\nfinding my niece not so well again, and wishing to take her on a short\nvisit to some friends to try change of air. If you could produce an\nimpression on Mrs. Lecount's mind (without overdoing it), that you are a\nlittle disappointed in me, and that you are rather inclined to doubt my\nheartiness in cultivating your acquaintance, you will greatly help our\npresent object. You may depend on our return to North Shingles in four\nor five days at furthest. If anything strikes me in the meanwhile, the\npost is always at our service, and I won't fail to write to you.\"\n\n\"Won't Miss Bygrave write to me?\" inquired Noel Vanstone, piteously.\n\"Did she know you were coming here? Did she send me no message?\"\n\n\"Unpardonable on my part to have forgotten it!\" cried the captain. \"She\nsent you her love.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone closed his eyes in silent ecstasy.\n\nWhen he opened them again Captain Wragge had passed through the garden\ngate and was on his way back to North Shingles. As soon as his own door\nhad closed on him, Mrs. Lecount descended from the post of observation\nwhich the captain had rightly suspected her of occupying, and addressed\nthe inquiry to her master which the captain had rightly foreseen would\nfollow his departure. The reply she received produced but one impression\non her mind. She at once set it down as a falsehood, and returned to her\nown window to keep watch over North Shingles more vigilantly than ever.\n\nTo her utter astonishment, after a lapse of less than half an hour she\nsaw an empty carriage draw up at Mr. Bygrave's door. Luggage was brought\nout and packed on the vehicle. Miss Bygrave appeared, and took her seat\nin it. She was followed into the carriage by a lady of great size\nand stature, whom the housekeeper conjectured to be Mrs. Bygrave. The\nservant came next, and stood waiting on the path. The last person to\nappear was Mr. Bygrave. He locked the house door, and took the key\naway with him to a cottage near at hand, which was the residence of the\nlandlord of North Shingles. On his return, he nodded to the servant, who\nwalked away by herself toward the humbler quarter of the little town,\nand joined the ladies in the carriage. The coachman mounted the box, and\nthe vehicle disappeared.\n\nMrs. Lecount laid down the opera-glass, through which she had been\nclosely investigating these proceedings, with a feeling of helpless\nperplexity which she was almost ashamed to acknowledge to herself.\nThe secret of Mr. Bygrave's object in suddenly emptying his house at\nAldborough of every living creature in it was an impenetrable mystery to\nher.\n\nSubmitting herself to circumstances with a ready resignation which\nCaptain Wragge had not shown, on his side, in a similar situation, Mrs.\nLecount wasted neither time nor temper in unprofitable guess-work. She\nleft the mystery to thicken or to clear, as the future might decide,\nand looked exclusively at the uses to which she might put the morning's\nevent in her own interests. Whatever might have become of the family at\nNorth Shingles, the servant was left behind, and the servant was exactly\nthe person whose assistance might now be of vital importance to the\nhousekeeper's projects. Mrs. Lecount put on her bonnet, inspected the\ncollection of loose silver in her purse, and set forth on the spot to\nmake the servant's acquaintance.\n\nShe went first to the cottage at which Mr. Bygrave had left the key\nof North Shingles, to discover the servant's present address from\nthe landlord. So far as this object was concerned, her errand proved\nsuccessful. The landlord knew that the girl had been allowed to go home\nfor a few days to her friends, and knew in what part of Aldborough her\nfriends lived. But here his sources of information suddenly dried up. He\nknew nothing of the destination to which Mr. Bygrave and his family had\nbetaken themselves, and he was perfectly ignorant of the number of days\nover which their absence might be expected to extend. All he could say\nwas, that he had not received a notice to quit from his tenant, and that\nhe had been requested to keep the key of the house in his possession\nuntil Mr. Bygrave returned to claim it in his own person.\n\nBaffled, but not discouraged, Mrs. Lecount turned her steps next toward\nthe back street of Aldborough, and astonished the servant's relatives by\nconferring on them the honor of a morning call.\n\nEasily imposed on at starting by Mrs. Lecount's pretense of calling\nto engage her, under the impression that she had left Mr. Bygrave's\nservice, the servant did her best to answer the questions put to her.\nBut she knew as little as the landlord of her master's plans. All she\ncould say about them was, that she had not been dismissed, and that she\nwas to await the receipt of a note recalling her when necessary to her\nsituation at North Shingles. Not having expected to find her better\ninformed on this part of the subject, Mrs. Lecount smoothly shifted her\nground, and led the woman into talking generally of the advantages and\ndefects of her situation in Mr. Bygrave's family.\n\nProfiting by the knowledge gained, in this indirect manner, of the\nlittle secrets of the household, Mrs. Lecount made two discoveries. She\nfound out, in the first place, that the servant (having enough to do in\nattending to the coarser part of the domestic work) was in no position\nto disclose the secrets of Miss Bygrave's wardrobe, which were known\nonly to the young lady herself and to her aunt. In the second place,\nthe housekeeper ascertained that the true reason of Mrs. Bygrave's rigid\nseclusion was to be found in the simple fact that she was little better\nthan an idiot, and that her husband was probably ashamed of allowing her\nto be seen in public. These apparently trivial discoveries enlightened\nMrs. Lecount on a very important point which had been previously\ninvolved in doubt. She was now satisfied that the likeliest way to\nobtaining a private investigation of Magdalen's wardrobe lay through\ndeluding the imbecile lady, and not through bribing the ignorant\nservant.\n\nHaving reached that conclusion--pregnant with coming assaults on\nthe weakly-fortified discretion of poor Mrs. Wragge--the housekeeper\ncautiously abstained from exhibiting herself any longer under an\ninquisitive aspect. She changed the conversation to local topics, waited\nuntil she was sure of leaving an excellent impression behind her, and\nthen took her leave.\n\n\nThree days passed; and Mrs. Lecount and her master--each with their\nwidely-different ends in view--watched with equal anxiety for the first\nsigns of returning life in the direction of North Shingles. In that\ninterval, no letter either from the uncle or the niece arrived for\nNoel Vanstone. His sincere feeling of irritation under this neglectful\ntreatment greatly assisted the effect of those feigned doubts on the\nsubject of his absent friends which the captain had recommended him to\nexpress in the housekeeper's presence. He confessed his apprehensions of\nhaving been mistaken, not in Mr. Bygrave only, but even in his niece as\nwell, with such a genuine air of annoyance that he actually contributed\na new element of confusion to the existing perplexities of Mrs. Lecount.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day Noel Vanstone met the postman in the\ngarden; and, to his great relief, discovered among the letters delivered\nto him a note from Mr. Bygrave.\n\nThe date of the note was \"Woodbridge,\" and it contained a few lines\nonly. Mr. Bygrave mentioned that his niece was better, and that she sent\nher love as before. He proposed returning to Aldborough on the next day,\nwhen he would have some new considerations of a strictly private nature\nto present to Mr. Noel Vanstone's mind. In the meantime he would beg\nMr. Vanstone not to call at North Shingles until he received a special\ninvitation to do so--which invitation should certainly be given on the\nday when the family returned. The motive of this apparently strange\nrequest should be explained to Mr. Vanstone's perfect satisfaction when\nhe was once more united to his friends. Until that period arrived, the\nstrictest caution was enjoined on him in all his communications with\nMrs. Lecount; and the instant destruction of Mr. Bygrave's letter, after\ndue perusal of it, was (if the classical phrase might be pardoned) a\n_sine qua non_.\n\nThe fifth day came. Noel Vanstone (after submitting himself to the _sine\nqua non_, and destroying the letter) waited anxiously for results; while\nMrs. Lecount, on her side, watched patiently for events. Toward three\no'clock in the afternoon the carriage appeared again at the gate of\nNorth Shingles. Mr. Bygrave got out and tripped away briskly to the\nlandlord's cottage for the key. He returned with the servant at his\nheels. Miss Bygrave left the carriage; her giant relative followed\nher example; the house door was opened; the trunks were taken off; the\ncarriage disappeared, and the Bygraves were at home again!\n\nFour o'clock struck, five o'clock, six o'clock, and nothing happened.\nIn half an hour more, Mr. Bygrave--spruce, speckless, and respectable as\never--appeared on the Parade, sauntering composedly in the direction of\nSea View.\n\nInstead of at once entering the house, he passed it; stopped, as if\nstruck by a sudden recollection; and, retracing his steps, asked for Mr.\nVanstone at the door. Mr. Vanstone came out hospitably into the\npassage. Pitching his voice to a tone which could be easily heard by any\nlistening individual through any open door in the bedroom regions, Mr.\nBygrave announced the object of his visit on the door-mat in the fewest\npossible words. He had been staying with a distant relative. The distant\nrelative possessed two pictures--Gems by the Old Masters--which he was\nwilling to dispose of, and which he had intrusted for that purpose to\nMr. Bygrave's care. If Mr. Noel Vanstone, as an amateur in such matters,\nwished to see the Gems, they would be visible in half an hour's time,\nwhen Mr. Bygrave would have returned to North Shingles.\n\nHaving delivered himself of this incomprehensible announcement, the\narch-conspirator laid his significant forefinger along the side of his\nshort Roman nose, said, \"Fine weather, isn't it? Good-afternoon!\" and\nsauntered out inscrutably to continue his walk on the Parade.\n\nOn the expiration of the half-hour Noel Vanstone presented himself at\nNorth Shingles, with the ardor of a lover burning inextinguishably\nin his bosom, through the superincumbent mental fog of a thoroughly\nbewildered man. To his inexpressible happiness, he found Magdalen alone\nin the parlor. Never yet had she looked so beautiful in his eyes. The\nrest and relief of her four days' absence from Aldborough had not failed\nto produce their results; she had more than recovered her composure.\nVibrating perpetually from one violent extreme to another, she had now\npassed from the passionate despair of five days since to a feverish\nexaltation of spirits which defied all remorse and confronted all\nconsequences. Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks were bright with color; she\ntalked incessantly, with a forlorn mockery of the girlish gayety of\npast days; she laughed with a deplorable persistency in laughing; she\nimitated Mrs. Lecount's smooth voice, and Mrs. Lecount's insinuating\ngraces of manner with an overcharged resemblance to the original, which\nwas but the coarse reflection of the delicately-accurate mimicry of\nformer times. Noel Vanstone, who had never yet seen her as he saw\nher now, was enchanted; his weak head whirled with an intoxication of\nenjoyment; his wizen cheeks flushed as if they had caught the infection\nfrom hers. The half-hour during which he was alone with her passed like\nfive minutes to him. When that time had elapsed, and when she\nsuddenly left him--to obey a previously-arranged summons to her aunt's\npresence--miser as he was, he would have paid at that moment five golden\nsovereigns out of his pocket for five golden minutes more passed in her\nsociety.\n\nThe door had hardly closed on Magdalen before it opened again, and the\ncaptain walked in. He entered on the explanations which his visitor\nnaturally expected from him with the unceremonious abruptness of a man\nhard pressed for time, and determined to make the most of every moment\nat his disposal.\n\n\"Since we last saw each other,\" he began, \"I have been reckoning up the\nchances for and against us as we stand at present. The result on my\nown mind is this: If you are still at Aldborough when that letter from\nZurich reaches Mrs. Lecount, all the pains we have taken will have been\npains thrown away. If your housekeeper had fifty brothers all dying\ntogether, she would throw the whole fifty over sooner than leave you\nalone at Sea View while we are your neighbors at North Shingles.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone's flushed cheek turned pale with dismay. His own knowledge\nof Mrs. Lecount told him that this view of the case was the right one.\n\n\"If _we_ go away again,\" proceeded the captain, \"nothing will be gained,\nfor nothing would persuade your housekeeper, in that case, that we have\nnot left you the means of following us. _You_ must leave Aldborough this\ntime; and, what is more, you must go without leaving a single visible\ntrace behind you for us to follow. If we accomplish this object in the\ncourse of the next five days, Mrs. Lecount will take the journey\nto Zurich. If we fail, she will be a fixture at Sea View, to a dead\ncertainty. Don't ask questions! I have got your instructions ready for\nyou, and I want your closest attention to them. Your marriage with my\nniece depends on your not forgetting a word of what I am now going to\ntell you.--One question first. Have you followed my advice? Have you\ntold Mrs. Lecount you are beginning to think yourself mistaken in me?\"\n\n\"I did worse than that,\" replied Noel Vanstone penitently. \"I committed\nan outrage on my own feelings. I disgraced myself by saying that I\ndoubted Miss Bygrave!\"\n\n\"Go on disgracing yourself, my dear sir! Doubt us both with all your\nmight, and I'll help you. One question more. Did I speak loud enough\nthis afternoon? Did Mrs. Lecount hear me?\"\n\n\"Yes. Lecount opened her door; Lecount heard you. What made you give me\nthat message? I see no pictures here. Is this another pious fraud, Mr.\nBygrave?\"\n\n\"Admirably guessed, Mr. Vanstone! You will see the object of my\nimaginary picture-dealing in the very next words which I am now about to\naddress to you. When you get back to Sea View, this is what you are to\nsay to Mrs. Lecount. Tell her that my relative's works of Art are two\nworthless pictures--copies from the Old Masters, which I have tried\nto sell you as originals at an exorbitant price. Say you suspect me of\nbeing little better than a plausible impostor, and pity my unfortunate\nniece for being associated with such a rascal as I am. There is your\ntext to speak from. Say in many words what I have just said in a few.\nYou can do that, can't you?\"\n\n\"Of course I can do it,\" said Noel Vanstone. \"But I can tell you one\nthing--Lecount won't believe me.\"\n\n\"Wait a little, Mr. Vanstone; I have not done with my instructions yet.\nYou understand what I have just told you? Very good. We may get on from\nto-day to to-morrow. Go out to-morrow with Mrs. Lecount at your\nusual time. I will meet you on the Parade, and bow to you. Instead of\nreturning my bow, look the other way. In plain English, cut me! That is\neasy enough to do, isn't it?\"\n\n\"She won't believe me, Mr. Bygrave--she won't believe me!\"\n\n\"Wait a little again, Mr. Vanstone. There are more instructions to\ncome. You have got your directions for to-day, and you have got your\ndirections for to-morrow. Now for the day after. The day after is the\nseventh day since we sent the letter to Zurich. On the seventh day\ndecline to go out walking as before, from dread of the annoyance of\nmeeting me again. Grumble about the smallness of the place; complain\nof your health; wish you had never come to Aldborough, and never made\nacquaintances with the Bygraves; and when you have well worried Mrs.\nLecount with your discontent, ask her on a sudden if she can't suggest a\nchange for the better. If you put that question to her naturally, do you\nthink she can be depended on to answer it?\"\n\n\"She won't want to be questioned at all,\" replied Noel Vanstone,\nirritably. \"I have only got to say I am tired of Aldborough; and, if\nshe believes me--which she won't; I'm quite positive, Mr. Bygrave, she\nwon't!--she will have her suggestion ready before I can ask for it.\"\n\n\"Ay! ay!\" said the captain eagerly. \"There is some place, then, that\nMrs. Lecount wants to go to this autumn?\"\n\n\"She wants to go there (hang her!) every autumn.\"\n\n\"To go where?\"\n\n\"To Admiral Bartram's--you don't know him, do you?--at St.\nCrux-in-the-Marsh.\"\n\n\"Don't lose your patience, Mr. Vanstone! What you are now telling me\nis of the most vital importance to the object we ha ve in view. Who is\nAdmiral Bartram?\"\n\n\"An old friend of my father's. My father laid him under obligations--my\nfather lent him money when they were both young men. I am like one of\nthe family at St. Crux; my room is always kept ready for me. Not that\nthere's any family at the admiral's except his nephew, George Bartram.\nGeorge is my cousin; I'm as intimate with George as my father was with\nthe admiral; and I've been sharper than my father, for I haven't lent\nmy friend any money. Lecount always makes a show of liking George--I\nbelieve to annoy me. She likes the admiral, too; he flatters her vanity.\nHe always invites her to come with me to St. Crux. He lets her have one\nof the best bedrooms, and treats her as if she was a lady. She is as\nproud as Lucifer--she likes being treated like a lady--and she pesters\nme every autumn to go to St. Crux. What's the matter? What are you\ntaking out your pocketbook for?\"\n\n\"I want the admiral's address, Mr. Vanstone, for a purpose which I will\nexplain immediately.\"\n\nWith those words, Captain Wragge opened his pocketbook and wrote\ndown the address from Noel Vanstone's dictation, as follows: \"Admiral\nBartram, St. Crux-in-the-Marsh, near Ossory, Essex.\"\n\n\"Good!\" cried the captain, closing his pocketbook again. \"The only\ndifficulty that stood in our way is now cleared out of it. Patience, Mr.\nVanstone--patience! Let us take up my instructions again at the point\nwhere we dropped them. Give me five minutes' more attention, and you\nwill see your way to your marriage as plainly as I see it. On the\nday after to-morrow you declare you are tired of Aldborough, and Mrs.\nLecount suggests St. Crux. You don't say yes or no on the spot; you take\nthe next day to consider it, and you make up your mind the last thing at\nnight to go to St. Crux the first thing in the morning. Are you in the\nhabit of superintending your own packing up, or do you usually shift all\nthe trouble of it on Mrs. Lecount's shoulders?\"\n\n\"Lecount has all the trouble, of course; Lecount is paid for it! But I\ndon't really go, do I?\"\n\n\"You go as fast as horses can take you to the railway without having\nheld any previous communication with this house, either personally or\nby letter. You leave Mrs. Lecount behind to pack up your curiosities,\nto settle with the tradespeople, and to follow you to St. Crux the next\nmorning. The next morning is the tenth morning. On the tenth morning\nshe receives the letter from Zurich; and if you only carry out my\ninstructions, Mr. Vanstone, as sure as you sit there, to Zurich she\ngoes.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone's color began to rise again, as the captain's stratagem\ndawned on him at last in its true light.\n\n\"And what am I to do at St. Crux?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Wait there till I call for you,\" replied the captain. \"As soon as Mrs.\nLecount's back is turned, I will go to the church here and give the\nnecessary notice of the marriage. The same day or the next, I will\ntravel to the address written down in my pocketbook, pick you up at the\nadmiral's, and take you on to London with me to get the license.\nWith that document in our possession, we shall be on our way back to\nAldborough while Mrs. Lecount is on her way out to Zurich; and before\nshe starts on her return journey, you and my niece will be man and wife!\nThere are your future prospects for you. What do you think of them?\"\n\n\"What a head you have got!\" cried Noel Vanstone, in a sudden outburst\nof enthusiasm. \"You're the most extraordinary man I ever met with. One\nwould think you had done nothing all your life but take people in.\"\n\nCaptain Wragge received that unconscious tribute to his native genius\nwith the complacency of a man who felt that he thoroughly deserved it.\n\n\"I have told you already, my dear sir,\" he said, modestly, \"that I never\ndo things by halves. Pardon me for reminding you that we have no\ntime for exchanging mutual civilities. Are you quite sure about your\ninstructions? I dare not write them down for fear of accidents. Try the\nsystem of artificial memory; count your instructions off after me, on\nyour thumb and your four fingers. To-day you tell Mrs. Lecount I have\ntried to take you in with my relative's works of Art. To-morrow you cut\nme on the Parade. The day after you refuse to go out, you get tired of\nAldborough, and you allow Mrs. Lecount to make her suggestion. The next\nday you accept the suggestion. And the next day to that you go to St.\nCrux. Once more, my dear sir! Thumb--works of Art. Forefinger--cut me\non the Parade. Middle finger--tired of Aldborough. Third finger--take\nLecount's advice. Little finger--off to St. Crux. Nothing can be\nclearer--nothing can be easier to do. Is there anything you don't\nunderstand? Anything that I can explain over again before you go?\"\n\n\"Only one thing,\" said Noel Vanstone. \"Is it settled that I am not to\ncome here again before I go to St. Crux?\"\n\n\"Most decidedly!\" answered the captain. \"The whole success of the\nenterprise depends on your keeping away. Mrs. Lecount will try the\ncredibility of everything you say to her by one test--the test of your\ncommunicating, or not, with this house. She will watch you night and\nday! Don't call here, don't send messages, don't write letters; don't\neven go out by yourself. Let her see you start for St. Crux on her\nsuggestion, with the absolute certainty in her own mind that you have\nfollowed her advice without communicating it in any form whatever to me\nor to my niece. Do that, and she _must_ believe you, on the best of all\nevidence for our interests, and the worst for hers--the evidence of her\nown senses.\"\n\nWith those last words of caution, he shook the little man warmly by the\nhand and sent him home on the spot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nON returning to Sea View, Noel Vanstone executed the instructions which\nprescribed his line of conduct for the first of the five days with\nunimpeachable accuracy. A faint smile of contempt hovered about Mrs.\nLecount's lips while the story of Mr. Bygrave's attempt to pass off his\nspurious pictures as originals was in progress, but she did not trouble\nherself to utter a single word of remark when it had come to an end.\n\"Just what I said!\" thought Noel Vanstone, cunningly watching her face;\n\"she doesn't believe a word of it!\"\n\nThe next day the meeting occurred on the Parade. Mr. Bygrave took off\nhis hat, and Noel Vanstone looked the other way. The captain's start of\nsurprise and scowl of indignation were executed to perfection, but they\nplainly failed to impose on Mrs. Lecount. \"I am afraid, sir, you have\noffended Mr. Bygrave to-day,\" she ironically remarked. \"Happily for\nyou, he is an excellent Christian! and I venture to predict that he will\nforgive you to-morrow.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone wisely refrained from committing himself to an answer.\nOnce more he privately applauded his own penetration; once more he\ntriumphed over his ingenious friend.\n\nThus far the captain's instructions had been too clear and simple to be\nmistaken by any one. But they advanced in complication with the advance\nof time, and on the third day Noel Vanstone fell confusedly into the\ncommission of a slight error. After expressing the necessary weariness\nof Aldborough, and the consequent anxiety for change of scene, he\nwas met (as he had anticipated) by an immediate suggestion from the\nhousekeeper, recommending a visit to St. Crux. In giving his answer\nto the advice thus tendered, he made his first mistake. Instead of\ndeferring his decision until the next day, he accepted Mrs. Lecount's\nsuggestion on the day when it was offered to him.\n\nThe consequences of this error were of no great importance. The\nhousekeeper merely set herself to watch her master one day earlier than\nhad been calculated on--a result which had been already provided for\nby the wise precautionary measure of forbidding Noel Vanstone all\ncommunication with North Shingles. Doubting, as Captain Wragge had\nforeseen, the sincerity of her master's desire to break off his\nconnection with the Bygraves by going to St. Crux, Mrs. Lecount tested\nthe truth or falsehood of the impression produced on her own mind by\nvigilantly watching for sign s of secret communication on one side or on\nthe other. The close attention with which she had hitherto observed the\nout-goings and in-comings at North Shingles was now entirely transferred\nto her master. For the rest of that third day she never let him out of\nher sight; she never allowed any third person who came to the house, on\nany pretense whatever, a minute's chance of private communication with\nhim. At intervals through the night she stole to the door of his room,\nto listen and assure herself that he was in bed; and before sunrise the\nnext morning, the coast-guardsman going his rounds was surprised to see\na lady who had risen as early as himself engaged over her work at one of\nthe upper windows of Sea View.\n\nOn the fourth morning Noel Vanstone came down to breakfast conscious\nof the mistake that he had committed on the previous day. The obvious\ncourse to take, for the purpose of gaining time, was to declare that\nhis mind was still undecided. He made the assertion boldly when the\nhousekeeper asked him if he meant to move that day. Again Mrs. Lecount\noffered no remark, and again the signs and tokens of incredulity showed\nthemselves in her face. Vacillation of purpose was not at all unusual in\nher experience of her master. But on this occasion she believed that\nhis caprice of conduct was assumed for the purpose of gaining time to\ncommunicate with North Shingles, and she accordingly set her watch on\nhim once more with doubled and trebled vigilance.\n\nNo letters came that morning. Toward noon the weather changed for the\nworse, and all idea of walking out as usual was abandoned. Hour after\nhour, while her master sat in one of the parlors, Mrs. Lecount kept\nwatch in the other, with the door into the passage open, and with a full\nview of North Shingles through the convenient side-window at which she\nhad established herself. Not a sign that was suspicious appeared, not a\nsound that was suspicious caught her ear. As the evening closed in, her\nmaster's hesitation came to an end. He was disgusted with the weather;\nhe hated the place; he foresaw the annoyance of more meetings with Mr.\nBygrave, and he was determined to go to St. Crux the first thing the\nnext morning. Lecount could stay behind to pack up the curiosities and\nsettle with the trades-people, and could follow him to the admiral's\non the next day. The housekeeper was a little staggered by the tone\nand manner in which he gave these orders. He had, to her own certain\nknowledge, effected no communication of any sort with North Shingles,\nand yet he seemed determined to leave Aldborough at the earliest\npossible opportunity. For the first time she hesitated in her adherence\nto her own conclusions. She remembered that her master had complained of\nthe Bygraves before they returned to Aldborough; and she was conscious\nthat her own incredulity had once already misled her when the appearance\nof the traveling-carriage at the door had proved even Mr. Bygrave\nhimself to be as good as his word.\n\nStill Mrs. Lecount determined to act with unrelenting caution to the\nlast. That night, when the doors were closed, she privately removed the\nkeys from the door in front and the door at the back. She then softly\nopened her bedroom window and sat down by it, with her bonnet and cloak\non, to prevent her taking cold. Noel Vanstone's window was on the same\nside of the house as her own. If any one came in the dark to speak to\nhim from the garden beneath, they would speak to his housekeeper as\nwell. Prepared at all points to intercept every form of clandestine\ncommunication which stratagem could invent, Mrs. Lecount watched through\nthe quiet night. When morning came, she stole downstairs before the\nservant was up, restored the keys to their places, and re-occupied her\nposition in the parlor until Noel Vanstone made his appearance at the\nbreakfast-table. Had he altered his mind? No. He declined posting to\nthe railway on account of the expense, but he was as firm as ever in his\nresolution to go to St. Crux. He desired that an inside place might be\nsecured for him in the early coach. Suspicious to the last, Mrs. Lecount\nsent the baker's man to take the place. He was a public servant, and Mr.\nBygrave would not suspect him of performing a private errand.\n\nThe coach called at Sea View. Mrs. Lecount saw her master established\nin his place, and ascertained that the other three inside seats were\nalready occupied by strangers. She inquired of the coachman if the\noutside places (all of which were not yet filled up) had their full\ncomplement of passengers also. The man replied in the affirmative. He\nhad two gentlemen to call for in the town, and the others would take\ntheir places at the inn. Mrs. Lecount forthwith turned her steps toward\nthe inn, and took up her position on the Parade opposite from a point\nof view which would enable her to see the last of the coach on its\ndeparture. In ten minutes more it rattled away, full outside and in; and\nthe housekeeper's own eyes assured her that neither Mr. Bygrave himself,\nnor any one belonging to North Shingles, was among the passengers.\n\nThere was only one more precaution to take, and Mrs. Lecount did not\nneglect it. Mr. Bygrave had doubtless seen the coach call at Sea\nView. He might hire a carriage and follow it to the railway on pure\nspeculation. Mrs. Lecount remained within view of the inn (the only\nplace at which a carriage could be obtained) for nearly an hour longer,\nwaiting for events. Nothing happened; no carriage made its appearance;\nno pursuit of Noel Vanstone was now within the range of human\npossibility. The long strain on Mrs. Lecount's mind relaxed at last. She\nleft her seat on the Parade, and returned in higher spirits than usual,\nto perform the closing household ceremonies at Sea View.\n\nShe sat down alone in the parlor and drew a long breath of relief.\nCaptain Wragge's calculations had not deceived him. The evidence of her\nown senses had at last conquered the housekeeper's incredulity, and had\nliterally forced her into the opposite extreme of belief.\n\nEstimating the events of the last three days from her own experience of\nthem; knowing (as she certainly knew) that the first idea of going to\nSt. Crux had been started by herself, and that her master had found\nno opportunity and shown no inclination to inform the family at North\nShingles that he had accepted her proposal, Mrs. Lecount was fairly\ncompelled to acknowledge that not a fragment of foundation remained to\njustify the continued suspicion of treachery in her own mind. Looking\nat the succession of circumstances under the new light thrown on them\nby results, she could see nothing unaccountable, nothing contradictory\nanywhere. The attempt to pass off the forged pictures as originals was\nin perfect harmony with the character of such a man as Mr. Bygrave.\nHer master's indignation at the attempt to impose on him; his\nplainly-expressed suspicion that Miss Bygrave was privy to it; his\ndisappointment in the niece; his contemptuous treatment of the uncle on\nthe Parade; his weariness of the place which had been the scene of his\nrash intimacy with strangers, and his readiness to quit it that morning,\nall commended themselves as genuine realities to the housekeeper's mind,\nfor one sufficient reason. Her own eyes had seen Noel Vanstone take his\ndeparture from Aldborough without leaving, or attempting to leave, a\nsingle trace behind him for the Bygraves to follow.\n\nThus far the housekeeper's conclusions led her, but no further. She\nwas too shrewd a woman to trust the future to chance and fortune. Her\nmaster's variable temper might relent. Accident might at any time give\nMr. Bygrave an opportunity of repairing the error that he had committed,\nand of artfully regaining his lost place in Noel Vanstone's estimation.\nAdmitting that circumstances had at last declared themselves\nunmistakably in her favor, Mrs. Lecount was not the less convinced that\nnothing would permanently assure her master's security for the future\nbut the plain exposure of the conspiracy which she had striven to\naccomplish from the first--which she was resolved to accomplish still.\n\n\"I always enjoy myself at St. Crux,\" thought Mrs. Lecount, opening her\naccount-books, and sorting the tradesmen's bills. \"The admiral is a\ngentleman, the house is noble, the table is excellent. No matter!\nHere at Sea View I stay by myself till I have seen the inside of Miss\nBygrave's wardrobe.\"\n\nShe packed her master's collection of curiosities in their various\ncases, settled the claims of the trades-people, and superintended the\ncovering of the furniture in the course of the day. Toward nightfall she\nwent out, bent on investigation, and ventured into the garden at North\nShingles under cover of the darkness. She saw the light in the parlor\nwindow, and the lights in the windows of the rooms upstairs, as\nusual. After an instant's hesitation she stole to the house door, and\nnoiselessly tried the handle from the outside. It turned the lock as she\nhad expected, from her experience of houses at Aldborough and at other\nwatering-places, but the door resisted her; the door was distrustfully\nbolted on the inside. After making that discovery, she went round to\nthe back of the house, and ascertained that the door on that side was\nsecured in the same manner. \"Bolt your doors, Mr. Bygrave, as fast as\nyou like,\" said the housekeeper, stealing back again to the Parade. \"You\ncan't bolt the entrance to your servant's pocket. The best lock you have\nmay be opened by a golden key.\"\n\nShe went back to bed. The ceaseless watching, the unrelaxing excitement\nof the last two days, had worn her out.\n\nThe next morning she rose at seven o'clock. In half an hour more she saw\nthe punctual Mr. Bygrave--as she had seen him on many previous mornings\nat the same time--issue from the gate of North Shingles, with his towels\nunder his arm, and make his way to a boat that was waiting for him on\nthe beach. Swimming was one among the many personal accomplishments of\nwhich the captain was master. He was rowed out to sea every morning,\nand took his bath luxuriously in the deep blue water. Mrs. Lecount had\nalready computed the time consumed in this recreation by her watch, and\nhad discovered that a full hour usually elapsed from the moment when he\nembarked on the beach to the moment when he returned.\n\nDuring that period she had never seen any other inhabitant of North\nShingles leave the house. The servant was no doubt at her work in the\nkitchen; Mrs. Bygrave was probably still in her bed; and Miss Bygrave\n(if she was up at that early hour) had perhaps received directions not\nto venture out in her uncle's absence. The difficulty of meeting the\nobstacle of Magdalen's presence in the house had been, for some days\npast, the one difficulty which all Mrs. Lecount's ingenuity had thus far\nproved unable to overcome.\n\nShe sat at the window for a quarter of an hour after the captain's\nboat had left the beach with her mind hard at work, and her eyes fixed\nmechanically on North Shingles--she sat considering what written excuse\nshe could send to her master for delaying her departure from Aldborough\nfor some days to come--when the door of the house she was watching\nsuddenly opened, and Magdalen herself appeared in the garden. There\nwas no mistaking her figure and her dress. She took a few steps hastily\ntoward the gate, stopped and pulled down the veil of her garden hat as\nif she felt the clear morning light too much for her, then hurried\nout on the Parade and walked away northward, in such haste, or in such\npre-occupation of mind, that she went through the garden gate without\nclosing it after her.\n\nMrs. Lecount started up from her chair with a moment's doubt of the\nevidence of her own eyes. Had the opportunity which she had been vainly\nplotting to produce actually offered itself to her of its own accord?\nHad the chances declared themselves at last in her favor, after steadily\nacting against her for so long? There was no doubt of it: in the popular\nphrase, \"her luck had turned.\" She snatched up her bonnet and mantilla,\nand made for North Shingles without an instant's hesitation. Mr. Bygrave\nout at sea; Miss Bygrave away for a walk; Mrs. Bygrave and the servant\nboth at home, and both easily dealt with--the opportunity was not to be\nlost; the risk was well worth running!\n\nThis time the house door was easily opened: no one had bolted it\nagain after Magdalen's departure. Mrs. Lecount closed the door softly,\nlistened for a moment in the passage, and heard the servant noisily\noccupied in the kitchen with her pots and pans. \"If my lucky star leads\nme straight into Miss Bygrave's room,\" thought the housekeeper, stealing\nnoiselessly up the stairs, \"I may find my way to her wardrobe without\ndisturbing anybody.\"\n\nShe tried the door nearest to the front of the house on the right-hand\nside of the landing. Capricious chance had deserted her already. The\nlock was turned. She tried the door opposite, on her left hand.\nThe boots ranged symmetrically in a row, and the razors on the\ndressing-table, told her at once that she had not found the right room\nyet. She returned to the right-hand side of the landing, walked down a\nlittle passage leading to the back of the house, and tried a third door.\nThe door opened, and the two opposite extremes of female humanity, Mrs.\nWragge and Mrs. Lecount, stood face to face in an instant!\n\n\"I beg ten thousand pardons!\" said Mrs. Lecount, with the most\nconsummate self-possession.\n\n\"Lord bless us and save us!\" cried Mrs. Wragge, with the most helpless\namazement.\n\nThe two exclamations were uttered in a moment, and in that moment Mrs.\nLecount took the measure of her victim. Nothing of the least importance\nescaped her. She noticed the Oriental Cashmere Robe lying half made, and\nhalf unpicked again, on the table; she noticed the imbecile foot of Mrs.\nWragge searching blindly in the neighborhood of her chair for a lost\nshoe; she noticed that there was a second door in the room besides the\ndoor by which she had entered, and a second chair within easy reach, on\nwhich she might do well to seat herself in a friendly and confidential\nway. \"Pray don't resent my intrusion,\" pleaded Mrs. Lecount, taking the\nchair. \"Pray allow me to explain myself!\"\n\nSpeaking in her softest voice, surveying Mrs. Wragge with a sweet smile\non her insinuating lips, and a melting interest in her handsome black\neyes, the housekeeper told her little introductory series of falsehoods\nwith an artless truthfulness of manner which the Father of Lies himself\nmight have envied. She had heard from Mr. Bygrave that Mrs. Bygrave\nwas a great invalid; she had constantly reproached herself, in her\nidle half-hours at Sea View (where she filled the situation of Mr. Noel\nVanstone's housekeeper), for not having offered her friendly services to\nMrs. Bygrave; she had been directed by her master (doubtless well known\nto Mrs. Bygrave, as one of her husband's friends, and, naturally, one of\nher charming niece's admirers), to join him that day at the residence\nto which he had removed from Aldborough; she was obliged to leave early,\nbut she could not reconcile it to her conscience to go without calling\nto apologize for her apparent want of neighborly consideration; she had\nfound nobody in the house; she had not been able to make the servant\nhear; she had presumed (not discovering that apartment downstairs)\nthat Mrs. Bygrave's boudoir might be on the upper story; she had\nthoughtlessly committed an intrusion of which she was sincerely ashamed,\nand she could now only trust to Mrs. Bygrave's indulgence to excuse and\nforgive her.\n\nA less elaborate apology might have served Mrs. Lecount's purpose. As\nsoon as Mrs. Wragge's struggling perceptions had grasped the fact that\nher unexpected visitor was a neighbor well known to her by repute, her\nwhole being became absorbed in admiration of Mrs. Lecount's lady-like\nmanners, and Mrs. Lecount's perfectly-fitting gown! \"What a noble\nway she has of talking!\" thought poor Mrs. Wragge, as the housekeeper\nreached her closing sentence. \"And, oh my heart alive, how nicely she's\ndressed!\"\n\n\"I see I disturb you,\" pursued Mrs. Lecount, artfully availing herself\nof the Oriental Cashmere Robe as a means ready at hand of reaching the\nend she had in view--\"I see I disturb you, ma'am, over an occupation\nwhich, I know by experience, requires the closest attention. Dear, dear\nme, you are un picking the dress again, I see, after it has been made!\nThis is my own experience again, Mrs. Bygrave. Some dresses are so\nobstinate! Some dresses seem to say to one, in so many words, 'No! you\nmay do what you like with me; I won't fit!'\"\n\nMrs. Wragge was greatly struck by this happy remark. She burst out\nlaughing, and clapped her great hands in hearty approval.\n\n\"That's what this gown has been saying to me ever since I first put the\nscissors into it,\" she exclaimed, cheerfully. \"I know I've got an awful\nbig back, but that's no reason. Why should a gown be weeks on hand,\nand then not meet behind you after all? It hangs over my Boasom like a\nsack--it does. Look here, ma'am, at the skirt. It won't come right. It\ndraggles in front, and cocks up behind. It shows my heels--and, Lord\nknows, I get into scrapes enough about my heels, without showing them\ninto the bargain!\"\n\n\"May I ask a favor?\" inquired Mrs. Lecount, confidentially. \"May I try,\nMrs. Bygrave, if I can make my experience of any use to you? I think\nour bosoms, ma'am, are our great difficulty. Now, this bosom of\nyours?--Shall I say in plain words what I think? This bosom of yours is\nan Enormous Mistake!\"\n\n\"Don't say that!\" cried Mrs. Wragge, imploringly. \"Don't please, there's\na good soul! It's an awful big one, I know; but it's modeled, for all\nthat, from one of Magdalen's own.\"\n\nShe was far too deeply interested on the subject of the dress to notice\nthat she had forgotten herself already, and that she had referred to\nMagdalen by her own name. Mrs. Lecount's sharp ears detected the mistake\nthe instant it was committed. \"So! so!\" she thought. \"One discovery\nalready. If I had ever doubted my own suspicions, here is an estimable\nlady who would now have set me right.--I beg your pardon,\" she\nproceeded, aloud, \"did you say this was modeled from one of your niece's\ndresses?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Wragge. \"It's as like as two peas.\"\n\n\"Then,\" replied Mrs. Lecount, adroitly, \"there must be some serious\nmistake in the making of your niece's dress. Can you show it to me?\"\n\n\"Bless your heart--yes!\" cried Mrs. Wragge. \"Step this way, ma'am; and\nbring the gown along with you, please. It keeps sliding off, out of pure\naggravation, if you lay it out on the table. There's lots of room on the\nbed in here.\"\n\nShe opened the door of communication and led the way eagerly into\nMagdalen's room. As Mrs. Lecount followed, she stole a look at her\nwatch. Never before had time flown as it flew that morning! In twenty\nminutes more Mr. Bygrave would be back from his bath.\n\n\"There!\" said Mrs. Wragge, throwing open the wardrobe, and taking a\ndress down from one of the pegs. \"Look there! There's plaits on her\nBoasom, and plaits on mine. Six of one and half a dozen of the other;\nand mine are the biggest--that's all!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount shook her head gravely, and entered forthwith into\nsubtleties of disquisition on the art of dressmaking which had the\ndesired effect of utterly bewildering the proprietor of the Oriental\nCashmere Robe in less than three minutes.\n\n\"Don't!\" cried Mrs. Wragge, imploringly. \"Don't go on like that! I'm\nmiles behind you; and my head's Buzzing already. Tell us, like a good\nsoul, what's to be done. You said something about the pattern just now.\nPerhaps I'm too big for the pattern? I can't help it if I am. Many's\nthe good cry I had, when I was a growing girl, over my own size! There's\nhalf too much of me, ma'am--measure me along or measure me across, I\ndon't deny it--there's half too much of me, anyway.\"\n\n\"My dear madam,\" protested Mrs. Lecount, \"you do yourself a wrong!\nPermit me to assure you that you possess a commanding figure--a figure\nof Minerva. A majestic simplicity in the form of a woman imperatively\ndemands a majestic simplicity in the form of that woman's dress. The\nlaws of costume are classical; the laws of costume must not be trifled\nwith! Plaits for Venus, puffs for Juno, folds for Minerva. I venture to\nsuggest a total change of pattern. Your niece has other dresses in her\ncollection. Why may we not find a Minerva pattern among them?\"\n\nAs she said those words, she led the way back to the wardrobe.\n\nMrs. Wragge followed, and took the dresses out one by one, shaking her\nhead despondently. Silk dresses appeared, muslin dresses appeared. The\none dress which remained invisible was the dress of which Mrs. Lecount\nwas in search.\n\n\"There's the lot of 'em,\" said Mrs. Wragge. \"They may do for Venus and\nthe two other Ones (I've seen 'em in picters without a morsel of decent\nlinen among the three), but they won't do for Me.\"\n\n\"Surely there is another dress left?\" said Mrs. Lecount, pointing to the\nwardrobe, but touching nothing in it. \"Surely I see something hanging in\nthe corner behind that dark shawl?\"\n\nMrs. Wragge removed the shawl; Mrs. Lecount opened the door of the\nwardrobe a little wider. There--hitched carelessly on the innermost\npeg--there, with its white spots, and its double flounce, was the brown\nAlpaca dress!\n\nThe suddenness and completeness of the discovery threw the housekeeper,\npracticed dissembler as she was, completely off her guard. She started\nat the sight of the dress. The instant afterward her eyes turned\nuneasily toward Mrs. Wragge. Had the start been observed? It had passed\nentirely unnoticed. Mrs. Wragge's whole attention was fixed on the\nAlpaca dress: she was staring at it incomprehensibly, with an expression\nof the utmost dismay.\n\n\"You seem alarmed, ma'am,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"What is there in the\nwardrobe to frighten you?\"\n\n\"I'd have given a crown piece out of my pocket,\" said Mrs. Wragge, \"not\nto have set my eyes on that gown. It had gone clean out of my head, and\nnow it's come back again. Cover it up!\" cried Mrs. Wragge, throwing the\nshawl over the dress in a sudden fit of desperation. \"If I look at it\nmuch longer, I shall think I'm back again in Vauxhall Walk!\"\n\nVauxhall Walk! Those two words told Mrs. Lecount she was on the brink\nof another discovery. She stole a second look at her watch. There was\nbarely ten minutes to spare before the time when Mr. Bygrave might\nreturn; there was not one of those ten minutes which might not bring his\nniece back to the house. Caution counseled Mrs. Lecount to go, without\nrunning any more risks. Curiosity rooted her to the spot, and gave the\ncourage to stay at all hazards until the time was up. Her amiable\nsmile began to harden a little as she probed her way tenderly into Mrs.\nWragge's feeble mind.\n\n\"You have some unpleasant remembrances of Vauxhall Walk?\" she said, with\nthe gentlest possible tone of inquiry in her voice. \"Or perhaps I should\nsay, unpleasant remembrances of that dress belonging to your niece?\"\n\n\"The last time I saw her with that gown on,\" said Mrs. Wragge, dropping\ninto a chair and beginning to tremble, \"was the time when I came back\nfrom shopping and saw the Ghost.\"\n\n\"The Ghost?\" repeated Mrs. Lecount, clasping her hands in graceful\nastonishment. \"Dear madam, pardon me! Is there such a thing in the\nworld? Where did you see it? In Vauxhall Walk? Tell me--you are the\nfirst lady I ever met with who has seen a ghost--pray tell me!\"\n\nFlattered by the position of importance which she had suddenly assumed\nin the housekeeper's eyes, Mrs. Wragge entered at full length into the\nnarrative of her supernatural adventure. The breathless eagerness with\nwhich Mrs. Lecount listened to her description of the specter's costume,\nthe specter's hurry on the stairs, and the specter's disappearance in\nthe bedroom; the extraordinary interest which Mrs. Lecount displayed\non hearing that the dress in the wardrobe was the very dress in which\nMagdalen happened to be attired at the awful moment when the ghost\nvanished, encouraged Mrs. Wragge to wade deeper and deeper into details,\nand to involve herself in a confusion of collateral circumstances out of\nwhich there seemed to be no prospect of her emerging for hours to come.\nFaster and faster the inexorable minutes flew by; nearer and nearer came\nthe fatal moment of Mr. Bygrave's return. Mrs. Lecount looked at her\nwatch for the third time, without an attempt on this occasion to conceal\nthe action from her companion's notice. There were literally two minutes\nleft for her to get clear of North Shingles. Two minutes would be\nenough, if no accident happened. She had discovered the Alpaca dress;\nshe had heard the whole story of the adventure in Vauxhall Walk; and,\nmore than that, she had even informed herself of the number of the\nhouse--which Mrs. Wragge happened to remember, because it answered\nto the number of years in her own age. All that was necessary to her\nmaster's complete enlightenment she had now accomplished. Even if there\nhad been time to stay longer, there was nothing worth staying for.\n\"I'll strike this worthy idiot dumb with a _coup d'etat_,\" thought the\nhousekeeper, \"and vanish before she recovers herself.\"\n\n\"Horrible!\" cried Mrs. Lecount, interrupting the ghostly narrative by\na shrill little scream and making for the door, to Mrs. Wragge's\nunutterable astonishment, without the least ceremony. \"You freeze the\nvery marrow of my bones. Good-morning!\" She coolly tossed the Oriental\nCashmere Robe into Mrs. Wragge's expansive lap and left the room in an\ninstant.\n\nAs she swiftly descended the stairs, she heard the door of the bedroom\nopen.\n\n\"Where are your manners?\" cried a voice from above, hailing her feebly\nover the banisters. \"What do you mean by pitching my gown at me in that\nway? You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\" pursued Mrs. Wragge, turning\nfrom a lamb to a lioness, as she gradually realized the indignity\noffered to the Cashmere Robe. \"You nasty foreigner, you ought to be\nashamed of yourself!\"\n\nPursued by this valedictory address, Mrs. Lecount reached the house\ndoor, and opened it without interruption. She glided rapidly along the\ngarden path, passed through the gate, and finding herself safe on the\nParade, stopped, and looked toward the sea.\n\nThe first object which her eyes encountered was the figure of Mr.\nBygrave standing motionless on the beach--a petrified bather, with his\ntowels in his hand! One glance at him was enough to show that he had\nseen the housekeeper passing out through his garden gate.\n\nRightly conjecturing that Mr. Bygrave's first impulse would lead him to\nmake instant inquiries in his own house, Mrs. Lecount pursued her way\nback to Sea View as composedly as if nothing had happened. When she\nentered the parlor where her solitary breakfast was waiting for her, she\nwas surprised to see a letter lying on the table. She approached to\ntake it up with an expression of impatience, thinking it might be some\ntradesman's bill which she had forgotten.\n\nIt was the forged letter from Zurich.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nTHE postmark and the handwriting on the address (admirably imitated from\nthe original) warned Mrs. Lecount of the contents of the letter before\nshe opened it.\n\nAfter waiting a moment to compose herself, she read the announcement of\nher brother's relapse.\n\nThere was nothing in the handwriting, there was no expression in\nany part of the letter which could suggest to her mind the faintest\nsuspicion of foul play. Not the shadow of a doubt occurred to her that\nthe summons to her brother's bedside was genuine. The hand that held\nthe letter dropped heavily into her lap; she became pale, and old, and\nhaggard in a moment. Thoughts, far removed from her present aims and\ninterests; remembrances that carried her back to other lands than\nEngland, to other times than the time of her life in service, prolonged\ntheir inner shadows to the surface, and showed the traces of their\nmysterious passage darkly on her face. The minutes followed each other,\nand still the servant below stairs waited vainly for the parlor bell.\nThe minutes followed each other, and still she sat, tearless and quiet,\ndead to the present and the future, living in the past.\n\nThe entrance of the servant, uncalled, roused her. With a heavy sigh,\nthe cold and secret woman folded the letter up again and addressed\nherself to the interests and the duties of the passing time.\n\nShe decided the question of going or not going to Zurich, after a\nvery brief consideration of it. Before she had drawn her chair to the\nbreakfast-table she had resolved to go.\n\nAdmirably as Captain Wragge's stratagem had worked, it might have\nfailed--unassisted by the occurrence of the morning--to achieve this\nresult. The very accident against which it had been the captain's chief\nanxiety to guard--the accident which had just taken place in spite of\nhim--was, of all the events that could have happened, the one event\nwhich falsified every previous calculation, by directly forwarding the\nmain purpose of the conspiracy! If Mrs. Lecount had not obtained the\ninformation of which she was in search before the receipt of the letter\nfrom Zurich, the letter might have addressed her in vain. She would have\nhesitated before deciding to leave England, and that hesitation might\nhave proved fatal to the captain's scheme.\n\nAs it was, with the plain proofs in her possession, with the gown\ndiscovered in Magdalen's wardrobe, with the piece cut out of it in her\nown pocketbook, and with the knowledge, obtained from Mrs. Wragge, of\nthe very house in which the disguise had been put on, Mrs. Lecount had\nnow at her command the means of warning Noel Vanstone as she had never\nbeen able to warn him yet, or, in other words, the means of guarding\nagainst any dangerous tendencies toward reconciliation with the Bygraves\nwhich might otherwise have entered his mind during her absence at\nZurich. The only difficulty which now perplexed her was the difficulty\nof deciding whether she should communicate with her master personally or\nby writing, before her departure from England.\n\nShe looked again at the doctor's letter. The word \"instantly,\" in the\nsentence which summoned her to her dying brother, was twice underlined.\nAdmiral Bartram's house was at some distance from the railway; the time\nconsumed in driving to St. Crux, and driving back again, might be time\nfatally lost on the journey to Zurich. Although she would infinitely\nhave preferred a personal interview with Noel Vanstone, there was no\nchoice on a matter of life and death but to save the precious hours by\nwriting to him.\n\nAfter sending to secure a place at once in the early coach, she sat down\nto write to her master.\n\nHer first thought was to tell him all that had happened at North\nShingles that morning. On reflection, however, she rejected the idea.\nOnce already (in copying the personal description from Miss Garth's\nletter) she had trusted her weapons in her master's hands, and Mr.\nBygrave had contrived to turn them against her. She resolved this time\nto keep them strictly in her own possession. The secret of the missing\nfragment of the Alpaca dress was known to no living creature but\nherself; and, until her return to England, she determined to keep it to\nherself. The necessary impression might be produced on Noel Vanstone's\nmind without venturing into details. She knew by experience the form of\nletter which might be trusted to produce an effect on him, and she now\nwrote it in these words:\n\n\n\"DEAR MR. NOEL--Sad news has reached me from Switzerland. My beloved\nbrother is dying and his medical attendant summons me instantly to\nZurich. The serious necessity of availing myself of the earliest means\nof conveyance to the Continent leaves me but one alternative. I must\nprofit by the permission to leave England, if necessary, which you\nkindly granted to me at the beginning of my brother's illness, and I\nmust avoid all delay by going straight to London, instead of turning\naside, as I should have liked, to see you first at St. Crux.\n\n\"Painfully as I am affected by the family calamity which has fallen\non me, I cannot let this opportunity pass without adverting to another\nsubject which seriously concerns your welfare, and in which (on that\naccount) your old housekeeper feels the deepest interest.\n\n\"I am going to surprise and shock you, Mr. Noel. Pray don't be agitated!\npray compose yourself!\n\n\"The impudent attempt to cheat you, which has happily opened your eyes\nto the true character of our neighbors at North Shingles, was not\nthe only object which Mr. Bygrave had in forcing himself on your\nacquaintance. The infamous conspiracy with which you were threatened\nin London has been in full progress against you under Mr. Bygrave's\ndirection, at Aldborough. Accident--I will tell you what accident when\nwe meet--has put me in possession of information precious to your\nfuture security. I have discovered, to an absolute certainty, that\nthe person calling herself Miss Bygrave is no other than the woman who\nvisited us in disguise at Vauxhall Walk.\n\n\"I suspected this from the first, but I had no evidence to support my\nsuspicions; I had no means of combating the false impression produced\non you. My hands, I thank Heaven, are tied no longer. I possess absolute\nproof of the assertion that I have just made--proof that your own eyes\ncan see--proof that would satisfy you, if you were judge in a Court of\nJustice.\n\n\"Perhaps even yet, Mr. Noel, you will refuse to believe me? Be it so.\nBelieve me or not, I have one last favor to ask, which your English\nsense of fair play will not deny me.\n\n\"This melancholy journey of mine will keep me away from England for a\nfortnight, or, at most, for three weeks. You will oblige me--and you\nwill certainly not sacrifice your own convenience and pleasure--by\nstaying through that interval with your friends at St. Crux. If, before\nmy return, some unexpected circumstance throws you once more into the\ncompany of the Bygraves, and if your natural kindness of heart inclines\nyou to receive the excuses which they will, in that case, certainly\naddress to you, place one trifling restraint on yourself, for your own\nsake, if not for mine. Suspend your flirtation with the young lady\n(I beg pardon of all other young ladies for calling her so!) until my\nreturn. If, when I come back, I fail to prove to you that Miss Bygrave\nis the woman who wore that disguise, and used those threatening words,\nin Vauxhall Wall, I will engage to leave your service at a day's\nnotice; and I will atone for the sin of bearing false witness against my\nneighbor by resigning every claim I have to your grateful remembrance,\non your father's account as well as on your own. I make this engagement\nwithout reserves of any kind; and I promise to abide by it--if my proofs\nfail--on the faith of a good Catholic, and the word of an honest woman.\nYour faithful servant,\n\n\"VIRGINIE LECOUNT.\"\n\n\nThe closing sentences of this letter--as the housekeeper well knew when\nshe wrote them--embodied the one appeal to Noel Vanstone which could be\ncertainly trusted to produce a deep and lasting effect. She might have\nstaked her oath, her life, or her reputation, on proving the assertion\nwhich she had made, and have failed to leave a permanent impression on\nhis mind. But when she staked not only her position in his service, but\nher pecuniary claims on him as well, she at once absorbed the ruling\npassion of his life in expectation of the result. There was not a doubt\nof it, in the strongest of all his interests--the interest of saving his\nmoney--he would wait.\n\n\"Checkmate for Mr. Bygrave!\" thought Mrs. Lecount, as she sealed and\ndirected the letter. \"The battle is over--the game is played out.\"\n\nWhile Mrs. Lecount was providing for her master's future security at Sea\nView, events were in full progress at North Shingles.\n\nAs soon as Captain Wragge recovered his astonishment at the\nhousekeeper's appearance on his own premises, he hurried into the house,\nand, guided by his own forebodings of the disaster that had happened,\nmade straight for his wife's room.\n\nNever, in all her former experience, had poor Mrs. Wragge felt the full\nweight of the captain's indignation as she felt it now. All the little\nintelligence she naturally possessed vanished at once in the whirlwind\nof her husband's rage. The only plain facts which he could extract from\nher were two in number. In the first place, Magdalen's rash desertion\nof her post proved to have no better reason to excuse it than Magdalen's\nincorrigible impatience: she had passed a sleepless night; she had\nrisen feverish and wretched; and she had gone out, reckless of all\nconsequences, to cool her burning head in the fresh air. In the second\nplace, Mrs. Wragge had, on her own confession, seen Mrs. Lecount, had\ntalked with Mrs. Lecount, and had ended by telling Mrs. Lecount the\nstory of the ghost. Having made these discoveries, Captain Wragge wasted\nno time in contending with his wife's terror and confusion. He withdrew\nat once to a window which commanded an uninterrupted prospect of Noel\nVanstone's house, and there established himself on the watch for events\nat Sea View, precisely as Mrs. Lecount had established herself on the\nwatch for events at North Shingles.\n\nNot a word of comment on the disaster of the morning escaped him when\nMagdalen returned and found him at his post. His flow of language seemed\nat last to have run dry. \"I told you what Mrs. Wragge would do,\" he\nsaid, \"and Mrs. Wragge has done it.\" He sat unflinchingly at the window\nwith a patience which Mrs. Lecount herself could not have surpassed. The\none active proceeding in which he seemed to think it necessary to engage\nwas performed by deputy. He sent the servant to the inn to hire a chaise\nand a fast horse, and to say that he would call himself before noon that\nday and tell the hostler when the vehicle would be wanted. Not a sign of\nimpatience escaped him until the time drew near for the departure of the\nearly coach. Then the captain's curly lips began to twitch with anxiety,\nand the captain's restless fingers beat the devil's tattoo unremittingly\non the window-pane.\n\nThe coach appeared at last, and drew up at Sea View. In a minute\nmore, Captain Wragge's own observation informed him that one among the\npassengers who left Aldborough that morning was--Mrs. Lecount.\n\nThe main uncertainty disposed of, a serious question--suggested by\nthe events of the morning--still remained to be solved. Which was the\ndestined end of Mrs. Lecount's journey--Zurich or St. Crux? That she\nwould certainly inform her master of Mrs. Wragge's ghost story, and of\nevery other disclosure in relation to names and places which might have\nescaped Mrs. Wragge's lips, was beyond all doubt. But of the two ways at\nher disposal of doing the mischief--either personally or by letter--it\nwas vitally important to the captain to know which she had chosen. If\nshe had gone to the admiral's, no choice would be left him but to follow\nthe coach, to catch the train by which she traveled, and to outstrip her\nafterward on the drive from the station in Essex to St. Crux. If, on the\ncontrary, she had been contented with writing to her master, it would\nonly be necessary to devise measures for intercepting the letter.\nThe captain decided on going to the post-office, in the first place.\nAssuming that the housekeeper had written, she would not have left the\nletter at the mercy of the servant--she would have seen it safely in the\nletter-box before leaving Aldborough.\n\n\"Good-morning,\" said the captain, cheerfully addressing the postmaster.\n\"I am Mr. Bygrave of North Shingles. I think you have a letter in the\nbox, addressed to Mr.--?\"\n\nThe postmaster was a short man, and consequently a man with a proper\nidea of his own importance. He solemnly checked Captain Wragge in full\ncareer.\n\n\"When a letter is once posted, sir,\" he said, \"nobody out of the office\nhas any business with it until it reaches its address.\"\n\nThe captain was not a man to be daunted, even by a postmaster. A bright\nidea struck him. He took out his pocketbook, in which Admiral Bartram's\naddress was written, and returned to the charge.\n\n\"Suppose a letter has been wrongly directed by mistake?\" he began. \"And\nsuppose the writer wants to correct the error after the letter is put\ninto the box?\"\n\n\"When a letter is once posted, sir,\" reiterated the impenetrable\nlocal authority, \"nobody out of the office touches it on any pretense\nwhatever.\"\n\n\"Granted, with all my heart,\" persisted the captain. \"I don't want to\ntouch it--I only want to explain myself. A lady has posted a letter\nhere, addressed to 'Noel Vanstone, Esq., Admiral Bartram's, St.\nCrux-in-the-Marsh, Essex.' She wrote in a great hurry, and she is not\nquite certain whether she added the name of the post-town, 'Ossory.' It\nis of the last importance that the delivery of the letter should not be\ndelayed. What is to hinder your facilitating the post-office work, and\nobliging a lady, by adding the name of the post-town (if it happens to\nbe left out), with your own hand? I put it to you as a zealous officer,\nwhat possible objection can there be to granting my request?\"\n\nThe postmaster was compelled to acknowledge that there could be no\nobjection, provided nothing but a necessary line was added to the\naddress, provided nobody touched the letter but himself, and provided\nthe precious time of the post-office was not suffered to run to waste.\nAs there happened to be nothing particular to do at that moment, he\nwould readily oblige the lady at Mr. Bygrave's request.\n\nCaptain Wragge watched the postmaster's hands, as they sorted the\nletters in the box, with breathless eagerness. Was the letter there?\nWould the hands of the zealous public servant suddenly stop? Yes! They\nstopped, and picked out a letter from the rest.\n\n\"'Noel Vanstone, Esquire,' did you say?\" asked the postmaster, keeping\nthe letter in his own hand.\n\n\"'Noel Vanstone, Esquire,'\" replied the captain, \"'Admiral Bartram's,\nSt. Crux-in-the-Marsh.'\"\n\n\"Ossory, Essex,\" chimed in the postmaster, throwing the letter back\ninto the box. \"The lady has made no mistake, sir. The address is quite\nright.\"\n\nNothing but a timely consideration of the heavy debt he owed to\nappearances prevented Captain Wragge from throwing his tall white hat up\nin the air as soon as he found the street once more. All further doubt\nwas now at an end. Mrs. Lecount had written to her master--therefore\nMrs. Lecount was on her way to Zurich!\n\nWith his head higher than ever, with the tails of his respectable\nfrock-coat floating behind him in the breeze, with his bosom's native\nimpudence sitting lightly on its throne, the captain strutted to the inn\nand called for the railway time-table. After making certain calculations\n(in black and white, as a matter of course), he ordered his chaise to\nbe ready in an hour--so as to reach the railway in time for the\nsecond train running to London--with which there happened to be no\ncommunication from Aldborough by coach.\n\nHis next proceeding was of a far more serious kind; his next proceeding\nimplied a terrible certainty of success. The day of the week was\nThursday. From the inn he went to the church, saw the clerk, and gave\nthe necessary notice for a marriage by license on the following Monday.\n\nBold as he was, his nerves were a little shaken by this last\nachievement; his hand trembled as it lifted the latch of the garden\ngate. He doctored his nerves with brandy and water before he sent\nfor Magdalen to inform her of the proceedings of the morning. Another\noutbreak might reasonably be expected when she heard that the last\nirrevocable step had been taken, and that notice had been given of the\nwedding-day.\n\nThe captain's watch warned him to lose no time in emptying his glass. In\na few minutes he sent the necessary message upstairs. While waiting for\nMagdalen's appearance, he provided himself with certain materials which\nwere now necessary to carry the enterprise to its crowning point. In the\nfirst place, he wrote his assumed name (by no means in so fine a hand as\nusual) on a blank visiting-card, and added underneath these words: \"Not\na moment is to be lost. I am waiting for you at the door--come down to\nme directly.\" His next proceeding was to take some half-dozen envelopes\nout of the case, and to direct them all alike to the following address:\n\"Thomas Bygrave, Esq., Mussared's Hotel, Salisbury Street, Strand,\nLondon.\" After carefully placing the envelopes and the card in his\nbreast-pocket, he shut up the desk. As he rose from the writing-table,\nMagdalen came into the room.\n\nThe captain took a moment to decide on the best method of opening the\ninterview, and determined, in his own phrase, to dash at it. In two\nwords he told Magdalen what had happened, and informed her that Monday\nwas to be her wedding-day.\n\nHe was prepared to quiet her, if she burst into a frenzy of passion; to\nreason with her, if she begged for time; to sympathize with her, if she\nmelted into tears. To his inexpressible surprise, results falsified\nall his calculations. She heard him without uttering a word, without\nshedding a tear. When he had done, she dropped into a chair. Her large\ngray eyes stared at him vacantly. In one mysterious instant all her\nbeauty left her; her face stiffened awfully, like the face of a\ncorpse. For the first time in the captain's experience of her,\nfear--all-mastering fear--had taken possession of her, body and soul.\n\n\"You are not flinching,\" he said, trying to rouse her. \"Surely you are\nnot flinching at the last moment?\"\n\nNo light of intelligence came into her eyes, no change passed over her\nface. But she heard him--for she moved a little in the chair, and slowly\nshook her head.\n\n\"You planned this marriage of your own freewill,\" pursued the captain,\nwith the furtive look and the faltering voice of a man ill at ease. \"It\nwas your own idea--not mine. I won't have the responsibility laid on\nmy shoulders--no! not for twice two hundred pounds. If your resolution\nfails you; if you think better of it--?\"\n\nHe stopped. Her face was changing; her lips were moving at last. She\nslowly raised her left hand, with the fingers outspread; she looked at\nit as if it was a hand that was strange to her; she counted the days on\nit, the days before the marriage.\n\n\"Friday, one,\" she whispered to herself; \"Saturday, two; Sunday, three;\nMonday--\" Her hands dropped into her lap, her face stiffened again; the\ndeadly fear fastened its paralyzing hold on her once more, and the next\nwords died away on her lips.\n\nCaptain Wragge took out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead.\n\n\"Damn the two hundred pounds!\" he said. \"Two thousand wouldn't pay me\nfor this!\"\n\nHe put the handkerchief back, took the envelopes which he had addressed\nto himself out of his pocket, and, approaching her closely for the first\ntime, laid his hand on her arm.\n\n\"Rouse yourself,\" he said, \"I have a last word to say to you. Can you\nlisten?\"\n\nShe struggled, and roused herself--a faint tinge of color stole over her\nwhite cheeks--she bowed her head.\n\n\"Look at these,\" pursued Captain Wragge, holding up the envelopes. \"If\nI turn these to the use for which they have been written, Mrs. Lecount's\nmaster will never receive Mrs. Lecount's letter. If I tear them up, he\nwill know by to-morrow's post that you are the woman who visited him in\nVauxhall Walk. Say the word! Shall I tear the envelopes up, or shall I\nput them back in my pocket?\"\n\nThere was a pause of dead silence. The murmur of the summer waves on the\nshingle of the beach and the voices of the summer idlers on the Parade\nfloated through the open window, and filled the empty stillness of the\nroom.\n\nShe raised her head; she lifted her hand and pointed steadily to the\nenvelopes.\n\n\"Put them back,\" she said.\n\n\"Do you mean it?\" he asked.\n\n\"I mean it.\"\n\nAs she gave that answer, there was a sound of wheels on the road\noutside.\n\n\"You hear those wheels?\" said Captain Wragge.\n\n\"I hear them.\"\n\n\"You see the chaise?\" said the captain, pointing through the window as\nthe chaise which had been ordered from the inn made its appearance at\nthe garden gate.\n\n\"I see it.\"\n\n\"And, of your own free-will, you tell me to go?\"\n\n\"Yes. Go!\"\n\nWithout another word he left her. The servant was waiting at the door\nwith his traveling bag. \"Miss Bygrave is not well,\" he said. \"Tell your\nmistress to go to her in the parlor.\"\n\nHe stepped into the chaise, and started on the first stage of the\njourney to St. Crux.\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTOWARD three o'clock in the afternoon Captain Wragge stopped at the\nnearest station to Ossory which the railway passed in its course through\nEssex. Inquiries made on the spot informed him that he might drive\nto St. Crux, remain there for a quarter of an hour, and return to the\nstation in time for an evening train to London. In ten minutes more the\ncaptain was on the road again, driving rapidly in the direction of the\ncoast.\n\nAfter proceeding some miles on the highway, the carriage turned off, and\nthe coachman involved himself in an intricate network of cross-roads.\n\n\"Are we far from St. Crux?\" asked the captain, growing impatient, after\nmile on mile had been passed without a sign of reaching the journey's\nend.\n\n\"You'll see the house, sir, at the next turn in the road,\" said the man.\n\nThe next turn in the road brought them within view of the open country\nagain. Ahead of the carriage, Captain Wragge saw a long dark line\nagainst the sky--the line of the sea-wall which protects the low coast\nof Essex from inundation. The flat intermediate country was intersected\nby a labyrinth of tidal streams, winding up from the invisible sea in\nstrange fantastic curves--rivers at high water, and channels of mud at\nlow. On his right hand was a quaint little village, mostly composed of\nwooden houses, straggling down to the brink of one of the tidal streams.\nOn his left hand, further away, rose the gloomy ruins of an abbey,\nwith a desolate pile of buildings, which covered two sides of a square\nattached to it. One of the streams from the sea (called, in Essex,\n\"backwaters\") curled almost entirely round the house. Another, from an\nopposite quarter, appeared to run straight through the grounds, and\nto separate one side of the shapeless mass of buildings, which was in\nmoderate repair, from another, which was little better than a ruin.\nBridges of wood and bridges of brick crossed the stream, and gave access\nto the house from all points of the compass. No human creature appeared\nin the neighborhood, and no sound was heard but the hoarse barking of a\nhouse-dog from an invisible courtyard.\n\n\"Which door shall I drive to, sir?\" asked the coachman. \"The front or\nthe back?\"\n\n\"The back,\" said Captain Wragge, feeling that the less notice he\nattracted in his present position, the safer that position might be.\n\nThe carriage twice crossed the stream before the coachman made his way\nthrough the grounds into a dreary inclosure of stone. At an open door on\nthe inhabited side of the place sat a weather-beaten old man, busily\nat work on a half-finished model of a ship. He rose and came to the\ncarriage door, lifting up his spectacles on his forehead, and looking\ndisconcerted at the appearance of a stranger.\n\n\"Is Mr. Noel Vanstone staying here?\" asked Captain Wragge.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the old man. \"Mr. Noel came yesterday.\"\n\n\"Take that card to Mr. Vanstone, if you please,\" said the captain, \"and\nsay I am waiting here to see him.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Noel Vanstone made his appearance, breathless and\neager--absorbed in anxiety for news from Aldborough. Captain Wragge\nopened the carriage door, seized his outstretched hand, and pulled him\nin without ceremony.\n\n\"Your housekeeper has gone,\" whispered the captain, \"and you are to\nbe married on Monday. Don't agitate yourself, and don't express your\nfeelings--there isn't time for it. Get the first active servant you can\nfind in the house to pack your bag in ten minutes, take leave of the\nadmiral, and come back at once with me to the London train.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone faintly attempted to ask a question. The captain declined\nto hear it.\n\n\"As much talk as you like on the road,\" he said. \"Time is too precious\nfor talking here. How do we know Lecount may not think better of it? How\ndo we know she may not turn back before she gets to Zurich?\"\n\nThat startling consideration terrified Noel Vanstone into instant\nsubmission.\n\n\"What shall I say to the admiral?\" he asked, helplessly.\n\n\"Tell him you are going to be married, to be sure! What does it matter,\nnow Lecount's back is turned? If he wonders you didn't tell him before,\nsay it's a runaway match, and the bride is waiting for you. Stop! Any\nletters addressed to you in your absence will be sent to this place, of\ncourse? Give the admiral these envelopes, and tell him to forward your\nletters under cover to me. I am an old customer at the hotel we are\ngoing to; and if we find the place full, the landlord may be depended\non to take care of any letters with my name on them. A safe address in\nLondon for your correspondence may be of the greatest importance. How do\nwe know Lecount may not write to you on her way to Zurich?\"\n\n\"What a head you have got!\" cried Noel Vanstone, eagerly taking the\nenvelopes. \"You think of everything.\"\n\nHe left the carriage in high excitement, and ran back into the house. In\nten minutes more Captain Wragge had him in safe custody, and the horses\nstarted on their return journey.\n\nThe travelers reached London in good time that evening, and found\naccommodation at the hotel.\n\nKnowing the restless, inquisitive nature of the man he had to deal with,\nCaptain Wragge had anticipated some little difficulty and embarrassment\nin meeting the questions which Noel Vanstone might put to him on the way\nto London. To his great relief, a startling domestic discovery absorbed\nhis traveling companion's whole attention at the outset of the journey.\nBy some extraordinary oversight, Miss Bygrave had been left, on the eve\nof her marriage, unprovided with a maid. Noel Vanstone declared that he\nwould take the whole responsibility of correcting this deficiency in the\narrangements, on his own shoulders; he would not trouble Mr. Bygrave\nto give him any assistance; he would confer, when they got to their\njourney's end, with the landlady of the hotel, and would examine the\ncandidates for the vacant office himself. All the way to London, he\nreturned again and again to the same subject; all the evening, at the\nhotel, he was in and out of the landlady's sitting-room, until he fairly\nobliged her to lock the door. In every other proceeding which related to\nhis marriage, he had been kept in the background; he had been compelled\nto follow in the footsteps of his ingenious friend. In the matter of the\nlady's maid he claimed his fitting position at last--he followed nobody;\nhe took the lead!\n\nThe forenoon of the next day was devoted to obtaining the license--the\npersonal distinction of making the declaration on oath being eagerly\naccepted by Noel Vanstone, who swore, in perfect good faith (on\ninformation previously obtained from the captain) that the lady was\nof age. The document procured, the bridegroom returned to examine the\ncharacters and qualifications of the women-servants out of the place\nwhom the landlady had engaged to summon to the hotel, while Captain\nWragge turned his steps, \"on business personal to himself,\" toward the\nresidence of a friend in a distant quarter of London.\n\nThe captain's friend was connected with the law, and the captain's\nbusiness was of a twofold nature. His first object was to inform himself\nof the legal bearings of the approaching marriage on the future of the\nhusband and the wife. His second object was to provide beforehand\nfor destroying all traces of the destination to which he might betake\nhimself when he left Aldborough on the wedding-day. Having reached his\nend successfully in both these cases, he returned to the hotel, and\nfound Noel Vanstone nursing his offended dignity in the landlady's\nsitting-room. Three ladies' maids had appeared to pass their\nexamination, and had all, on coming to the question of wages, impudently\ndeclined accepting the place. A fourth candidate was expected to present\nherself on the next day; and, until she made her appearance, Noel\nVanstone positively declined removing from the metropolis. Captain\nWragge showed his annoyance openly at the unnecessary delay thus\noccasioned in the return to Aldborough, but without producing any\neffect. Noel Vanstone shook his obstinate little head, and solemnly\nrefused to trifle with his responsibilities.\n\nThe first event which occurred on Saturday morning was the arrival of\nMrs. Lecount's letter to her master, inclosed in one of the envelopes\nwhich the captain had addressed to himself. He received it (by previous\narrangement with the waiter) in his bedroom--read it with the closest\nattention--and put it away carefully in his pocketbook. The letter\nwas ominous of serious events to come when the housekeeper returned to\nEngland; and it was due to Magdalen--who was the person threatened--to\nplace the warning of danger in her own possession.\n\nLater in the day the fourth candidate appeared for the maid's\nsituation--a young woman of small expectations and subdued manners, who\nlooked (as the landlady remarked) like a person overtaken by misfortune.\nShe passed the ordeal of examination successfully, and accepted the\nwages offered with out a murmur. The engagement having been ratified on\nboth sides, fresh delays ensued, of which Noel Vanstone was once more\nthe cause. He had not yet made up his mind whether he would, or would\nnot, give more than a guinea for the wedding-ring; and he wasted the\nrest of the day to such disastrous purpose in one jeweler's shop after\nanother, that he and the captain, and the new lady's maid (who traveled\nwith them), were barely in time to catch the last train from London that\nevening. It was late at night when they left the railway at the nearest\nstation to Aldborough. Captain Wragge had been strangely silent all\nthrough the journey. His mind was ill at ease. He had left Magdalen,\nunder very critical circumstances, with no fit person to control her,\nand he was wholly ignorant of the progress of events in his absence at\nNorth Shingles.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nWHAT had happened at Aldborough in Captain Wragge's absence? Events had\noccurred which the captain's utmost dexterity might have found it hard\nto remedy.\n\nAs soon as the chaise had left North Shingles, Mrs. Wragge received\nthe message which her husband had charged the servant to deliver. She\nhastened into the parlor, bewildered by her stormy interview with the\ncaptain, and penitently conscious that she had done wrong, without\nknowing what the wrong was. If Magdalen's mind had been unoccupied by\nthe one idea of the marriage which now filled it--if she had possessed\ncomposure enough to listen to Mrs. Wragge's rambling narrative of what\nhad happened during her interview with the housekeeper--Mrs. Lecount's\nvisit to the wardrobe must, sooner or later, have formed part of the\ndisclosure; and Magdalen, although she might never have guessed the\ntruth, must at least have been warned that there was some element of\ndanger lurking treacherously in the Alpaca dress. As it was, no such\nconsequence as this followed Mrs. Wragge's appearance in the parlor; for\nno such consequence was now possible.\n\nEvents which had happened earlier in the morning, events which had\nhappened for days and weeks past, had vanished as completely from\nMagdalen's mind as if they had never taken place. The horror of the\ncoming Monday--the merciless certainty implied in the appointment of the\nday and hour--petrified all feeling in her, and annihilated all thought.\nMrs. Wragge made three separate attempts to enter on the subject of the\nhousekeeper's visit. The first time she might as well have addressed\nherself to the wind, or to the sea. The second attempt seemed likely\nto be more successful. Magdalen sighed, listened for a moment\nindifferently, and then dismissed the subject. \"It doesn't matter,\" she\nsaid. \"The end has come all the same. I'm not angry with you. Say no\nmore.\" Later in the day, from not knowing what else to talk about, Mrs.\nWragge tried again. This time Magdalen turned on her impatiently. \"For\nGod's sake, don't worry me about trifles! I can't bear it.\" Mrs. Wragge\nclosed her lips on the spot, and returned to the subject no more.\nMagdalen, who had been kind to her at all other times, had angrily\nforbidden it. The captain--utterly ignorant of Mrs. Lecount's interest\nin the secrets of the wardrobe--had never so much as approached it. All\nthe information that he had extracted from his wife's mental confusion,\nhe had extracted by putting direct questions, derived purely from\nthe resources of his own knowledge. He had insisted on plain answers,\nwithout excuses of any kind; he had carried his point as usual; and\nhis departure the same morning had left him no chance of re-opening the\nquestion, even if his irritation against his wife had permitted him\nto do so. There the Alpaca dress hung, neglected in the dark--the\nunnoticed, unsuspected center of dangers that were still to come.\n\nToward the afternoon Mrs. Wragge took courage to start a suggestion of\nher own--she pleaded for a little turn in the fresh air.\n\nMagdalen passively put on her hat; passively accompanied her companion\nalong the public walk, until they reached its northward extremity. Here\nthe beach was left solitary, and here they sat down, side by side, on\nthe shingle. It was a bright, exhilarating day; pleasure-boats were\nsailing on the calm blue water; Aldborough was idling happily afloat\nand ashore. Mrs. Wragge recovered her spirits in the gayety of the\nprospect--she amused herself like a child, by tossing pebbles into the\nsea. From time to time she stole a questioning glance at Magdalen, and\nsaw no encouragement in her manner, no change to cordiality in her face.\nShe sat silent on the slope of the shingle, with her elbow on her knee,\nand her head resting on her hand, looking out over the sea--looking\nwith rapt attention, and yet with eyes that seemed to notice nothing.\nMrs. Wragge wearied of the pebbles, and lost her interest in looking at\nthe pleasure-boats. Her great head began to nod heavily, and she dozed\nin the warm, drowsy air. When she woke, the pleasure-boats were far off;\ntheir sails were white specks in the distance. The idlers on the beach\nwere thinned in number; the sun was low in the heaven; the blue sea was\ndarker, and rippled by a breeze. Changes on sky and earth and ocean\ntold of the waning day; change was everywhere--except close at her side.\nThere Magdalen sat, in the same position, with weary eyes that still\nlooked over the sea, and still saw nothing.\n\n\"Oh, do speak to me!\" said Mrs. Wragge.\n\nMagdalen started, and looked about her vacantly.\n\n\"It's late,\" she said, shivering under the first sensation that reached\nher of the rising breeze. \"Come home; you want your tea.\" They walked\nhome in silence.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me for asking,\" said Mrs. Wragge, as they sat\ntogether at the tea-table. \"Are you troubled, my dear, in your mind?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Magdalen. \"Don't notice me. My trouble will soon be\nover.\"\n\nShe waited patiently until Mrs. Wragge had made an end of the meal, and\nthen went upstairs to her own room.\n\n\"Monday!\" she said, as she sat down at her toilet-table. \"Something may\nhappen before Monday comes!\"\n\nHer fingers wandered mechanically among the brushes and combs, the tiny\nbottles and cases placed on the table. She set them in order, now in one\nway, and now in another--then on a sudden pushed them away from her in a\nheap. For a minute or two her hands remained idle. That interval passed,\nthey grew restless again, and pulled the two little drawers backward and\nforward in their grooves. Among the objects laid in one of them was a\nPrayer-book which had belonged to her at Combe-Raven, and which she had\nsaved with her other relics of the past, when she and her sister had\ntaken their farewell of home. She opened the Prayer-book, after a long\nhesitation, at the Marriage Service, shut it again before she had read a\nline, and put it back hurriedly in one of the drawers. After turning the\nkey in the locks, she rose and walked to the window. \"The horrible\nsea!\" she said, turning from it with a shudder of disgust--\"the lonely,\ndreary, horrible sea!\"\n\nShe went back to the drawer, and took the Prayer-book out for the second\ntime, half opened it again at the Marriage Service, and impatiently\nthrew it back into the drawer. This time, after turning the lock, she\ntook the key away, walked with it in her hand to the open window, and\nthrew it violently from her into the garden. It fell on a bed thickly\nplanted with flowers. It was invisible; it was lost. The sense of its\nloss seemed to relieve her.\n\n\"Something may happen on Friday; something may happen on Saturday;\nsomething may happen on Sunday. Three days still!\"\n\nShe closed the green shutters outside the window and drew the curtains\nto darken the room still more. Her head felt heavy; her eyes were\nburning hot. She threw herself on her bed, with a sullen impulse to\nsleep away the time. The quiet of the house helped her; the darkness of\nthe room helped her; the stupor of mind into which she had fallen had\nits effect on her senses; she dropped into a broken sleep. Her restless\nhands moved incessantly, her head tossed from side to side of the\npillow, but still she slept. Ere long words fell by ones and twos\nfrom her lips; words whispered in her sleep, growing more and more\ncontinuous, more and more articulate, the longer the sleep lasted--words\nwhich seemed to calm her restlessness and to hush her into deeper\nrepose. She smiled; she was in the happy land of dreams; Frank's name\nescaped her. \"Do you love me, Frank?\" she whispered. \"Oh, my darling,\nsay it again! say it again!\"\n\nThe time passed, the room grew darker; and still she slumbered and\ndreamed. Toward sunset--without any noise inside the house or out to\naccount for it--she started up on the bed, awake again in an instant.\nThe drowsy obscurity of the room struck her with terror. She ran to the\nwindow, pushed open the shutters, and leaned far out into the evening\nair and the evening light. Her eyes devoured the trivial sights on the\nbeach; her ears drank in the welcome murmur of the sea. Anything to\ndeliver her from the waking impression which her dreams had left! No\nmore darkness, no more repose. Sleep that came mercifully to others came\ntreacherously to her. Sleep had only closed her eyes on the future, to\nopen them on the past.\n\nShe went down again into the parlor, eager to talk--no matter how idly,\nno matter on what trifles. The room was empty. Perhaps Mrs. Wragge had\ngone to her work--perhaps she was too tired to talk. Magdalen took her\nhat from the table and went out. The sea that she had shrunk from, a few\nhours since, looked friendly now. How lovely it was in its cool evening\nblue! What a god-like joy in the happy multitude of waves leaping up to\nthe light of heaven!\n\nShe stayed out until the night fell and the stars appeared. The night\nsteadied her.\n\nBy slow degrees her mind recovered its balance and she looked her\nposition unflinchingly in the face. The vain hope that accident might\ndefeat the very end for which, of her own free-will, she had ceaselessly\nplotted and toiled, vanished and left her; self-dissipated in its own\nweakness. She knew the true alternative, and faced it. On one side was\nthe revolting ordeal of the marriage; on the other, the abandonment\nof her purpose. Was it too late to choose between the sacrifice of the\npurpose and the sacrifice of herself? Yes! too late. The backward path\nhad closed behind her. Time that no wish could change, Time that no\nprayers could recall, had made her purpose a part of herself: once she\nhad governed it; now it governed her. The more she shrank, the harder\nshe struggled, the more mercilessly it drove her on. No other feeling\nin her was strong enough to master it--not even the horror that was\nmaddening her--the horror of her marriage.\n\nToward nine o'clock she went back to the house.\n\n\"Walking again!\" said Mrs. Wragge, meeting her at the door. \"Come in and\nsit down, my dear. How tired you must be!\"\n\nMagdalen smiled, and patted Mrs. Wragge kindly on the shoulder.\n\n\"You forget how strong I am,\" she said. \"Nothing hurts me.\"\n\nShe lit her candle and went upstairs again into her room. As she\nreturned to the old place by her toilet-table, the vain hope in the\nthree days of delay, the vain hope of deliverance by accident, came back\nto her--this time in a form more tangible than the form which it had\nhitherto worn.\n\n\"Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Something may happen to him; something may\nhappen to me. Something serious; something fatal. One of us may die.\"\n\nA sudden change came over her face. She shivered, though there was no\ncold in the air. She started, though there was no noise to alarm her.\n\n\"One of us may die. I may be the one.\"\n\nShe fell into deep thought, roused herself after a while, and, opening\nthe door, called to Mrs. Wragge to come and speak to her.\n\n\"You were right in thinking I should fatigue myself,\" she said. \"My walk\nhas been a little too much for me. I feel tired, and I am going to bed.\nGood-night.\" She kissed Mrs. Wragge and softly closed the door again.\n\nAfter a few turns backward and forward in the room, she abruptly opened\nher writing-case and began a letter to her sister. The letter grew and\ngrew under her hands; she filled sheet after sheet of note-paper. Her\nheart was full of her subject: it was her own story addressed to Norah.\nShe shed no tears; she was composed to a quiet sadness. Her pen ran\nsmoothly on. After writing for more than two hours, she left off while\nthe letter was still unfinished. There was no signature attached to\nit--there was a blank space reserved, to be filled up at some other\ntime. After putting away the case, with the sheets of writing secured\ninside it, she walked to the window for air, and stood there looking\nout.\n\nThe moon was waning over the sea. The breeze of the earlier hours had\ndied out. On earth and ocean, the spirit of the Night brooded in a deep\nand awful calm.\n\nHer head drooped low on her bosom, and all the view waned before her\neyes with the waning moon. She saw no sea, no sky. Death, the Tempter,\nwas busy at her heart. Death, the Tempter, pointed homeward, to the\ngrave of her dead parents in Combe-Raven churchyard.\n\n\"Nineteen last birthday,\" she thought. \"Only nineteen!\" She moved away\nfrom the window, hesitated, and then looked out again at the view. \"The\nbeautiful night!\" she said, gratefully. \"Oh, the beautiful night!\"\n\nShe left the window and lay down on her bed. Sleep, that had come\ntreacherously before, came mercifully now; came deep and dreamless, the\nimage of her last waking thought--the image of Death.\n\nEarly the next morning Mrs. Wragge went into Magdalen's room, and found\nthat she had risen betimes. She was sitting before the glass, drawing\nthe comb slowly through and through her hair--thoughtful and quiet.\n\n\"How do you feel this morning, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Wragge. \"Quite well\nagain?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nAfter replying in the affirmative, she stopped, considered for a moment,\nand suddenly contradicted herself.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"not quite well. I am suffering a little from\ntoothache.\"\n\nAs she altered her first answer in those words she gave a twist to her\nhair with the comb, so that it fell forward and hid her face.\n\nAt breakfast she was very silent, and she took nothing but a cup of tea.\n\n\"Let me go to the chemist's and get something,\" said Mrs. Wragge.\n\n\"No, thank you.\"\n\n\"Do let me!\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\nShe refused for the second time, sharply and angrily. As usual, Mrs.\nWragge submitted, and let her have her own way. When breakfast was\nover, she rose, without a word of explanation, and went out. Mrs. Wragge\nwatched her from the window and saw that she took the direction of the\nchemist's shop.\n\nOn reaching the chemist's door she stopped--paused before entering\nthe shop, and looked in at the window--hesitated, and walked away a\nlittle--hesitated again, and took the first turning which led back to\nthe beach.\n\nWithout looking about her, without caring what place she chose, she\nseated herself on the shingle. The only persons who were near to her, in\nthe position she now occupied, were a nursemaid and two little boys. The\nyoungest of the two had a tiny toy-ship in his hand. After looking at\nMagdalen for a little while with the quaintest gravity and attention,\nthe boy suddenly approached her, and opened the way to an acquaintance\nby putting his toy composedly on her lap.\n\n\"Look at my ship,\" said the child, crossing his hands on Magdalen's\nknee.\n\nShe was not usually patient with children. In happier days she would\nnot have met the boy's advance toward her as she met it now. The hard\ndespair in her eyes left them suddenly; her fast-closed lips parted and\ntrembled. She put the ship back into the child's hands and lifted him on\nher lap.\n\n\"Will you give me a kiss?\" she said, faintly. The boy looked at his ship\nas if he would rather have kissed the ship.\n\nShe repeated the question--repeated it almost humbly. The child put his\nhand up to her neck and kissed her.\n\n\"If I was your sister, would you love me?\" All the misery of her\nfriendless position, all the wasted tenderness of her heart, poured from\nher in those words.\n\n\"Would you love me?\" she repeated, hiding her face on the bosom of the\nchild's frock.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the boy. \"Look at my ship.\"\n\nShe looked at the ship through her gathering tears.\n\n\"What do you call it?\" she asked, trying ha rd to find her way even to\nthe interest of a child.\n\n\"I call it Uncle Kirke's ship,\" said the boy. \"Uncle Kirke has gone\naway.\"\n\nThe name recalled nothing to her memory. No remembrances but old\nremembrances lived in her now. \"Gone?\" she repeated absently, thinking\nwhat she should say to her little friend next.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the boy. \"Gone to China.\"\n\nEven from the lips of a child that word struck her to the heart. She put\nKirke's little nephew off her lap, and instantly left the beach.\n\nAs she turned back to the house, the struggle of the past night renewed\nitself in her mind. But the sense of relief which the child had brought\nto her, the reviving tenderness which she had felt while he sat on her\nknee, influenced her still. She was conscious of a dawning hope, opening\nfreshly on her thoughts, as the boy's innocent eyes had opened on her\nface when he came to her on the beach. Was it too late to turn back?\nOnce more she asked herself that question, and now, for the first time,\nshe asked it in doubt.\n\nShe ran up to her own room with a lurking distrust in her changed self\nwhich warned her to act, and not to think. Without waiting to remove her\nshawl or to take off her hat, she opened her writing-case and addressed\nthese lines to Captain Wragge as fast as her pen could trace them:\n\n\"You will find the money I promised you inclosed in this. My resolution\nhas failed me. The horror of marrying him is more than I can face. I\nhave left Aldborough. Pity my weakness, and forget me. Let us never meet\nagain.\"\n\nWith throbbing heart, with eager, trembling fingers, she drew her little\nwhite silk bag from her bosom and took out the banknotes to inclose\nthem in the letter. Her hand searched impetuously; her hand had lost its\ndiscrimination of touch. She grasped the whole contents of the bag in\none handful of papers, and drew them out violently, tearing some and\ndisarranging the folds of others. As she threw them down before her on\nthe table, the first object that met her eye was her own handwriting,\nfaded already with time. She looked closer, and saw the words she\nhad copied from her dead father's letter--saw the lawyer's brief and\nterrible commentary on them confronting her at the bottom of the page:\n\n_Mr. Vanstone's daughters are Nobody's Children, and the law leaves them\nhelpless at their uncle's mercy._\n\nHer throbbing heart stopped; her trembling hands grew icily quiet. All\nthe Past rose before her in mute, overwhelming reproach. She took up the\nlines which her own hand had written hardly a minute since, and looked\nat the ink, still wet on the letters, with a vacant incredulity.\n\nThe color that had risen on her cheeks faded from them once more. The\nhard despair looked out again, cold and glittering, in her tearless\neyes. She folded the banknotes carefully, and put them back in her bag.\nShe pressed the copy of her father's letter to her lips, and returned\nit to its place with the banknotes. When the bag was in her bosom\nagain, she waited a little, with her face hidden in her hands, then\ndeliberately tore up the lines addressed to Captain Wragge. Before the\nink was dry, the letter lay in fragments on the floor.\n\n\"No!\" she said, as the last morsel of the torn paper dropped from her\nhand. \"On the way I go there is no turning back.\"\n\nShe rose composedly and left the room. While descending the stairs,\nshe met Mrs. Wragge coming up. \"Going out again, my dear?\" asked Mrs.\nWragge. \"May I go with you?\"\n\nMagdalen's attention wandered. Instead of answering the question, she\nabsently answered her own thoughts.\n\n\"Thousands of women marry for money,\" she said. \"Why shouldn't I?\"\n\nThe helpless perplexity of Mrs. Wragge's face as she spoke those words\nroused her to a sense of present things. \"My poor dear!\" she said; \"I\npuzzle you, don't I? Never mind what I say--all girls talk nonsense, and\nI'm no better than the rest of them. Come! I'll give you a treat. You\nshall enjoy yourself while the captain is away. We will have a long\ndrive by ourselves. Put on your smart bonnet, and come with me to the\nhotel. I'll tell the landlady to put a nice cold dinner into a basket.\nYou shall have all the things you like, and I'll wait on you. When you\nare an old, old woman, you will remember me kindly, won't you? You\nwill say: 'She wasn't a bad girl; hundreds worse than she was live and\nprosper, and nobody blames them.' There! there! go and put your bonnet\non. Oh, my God, what is my heart made of! How it lives and lives, when\nother girls' hearts would have died in them long ago!\"\n\nIn half an hour more she and Mrs. Wragge were seated together in the\ncarriage. One of the horses was restive at starting. \"Flog him,\" she\ncried angrily to the driver. \"What are you frightened about? Flog him!\nSuppose the carriage was upset,\" she said, turning suddenly to her\ncompanion; \"and suppose I was thrown out and killed on the spot?\nNonsense! don't look at me in that way. I'm like your husband; I have a\ndash of humor, and I'm only joking.\"\n\nThey were out the whole day. When they reached home again, it was after\ndark. The long succession of hours passed in the fresh air left them\nboth with the same sense of fatigue. Again that night Magdalen slept the\ndeep dreamless sleep of the night before. And so the Friday closed.\n\n\nHer last thought at night had been the thought which had sustained her\nthroughout the day. She had laid her head on the pillow with the same\nreckless resolution to submit to the coming trial which had already\nexpressed itself in words when she and Mrs. Wragge met by accident on\nthe stairs. When she woke on the morning of Saturday, the resolution was\ngone. The Friday's thoughts--the Friday's events even--were blotted out\nof her mind. Once again, creeping chill through the flow of her young\nblood, she felt the slow and deadly prompting of despair which had come\nto her in the waning moonlight, which had whispered to her in the awful\ncalm.\n\n\"I saw the end as the end must be,\" she said to herself, \"on Thursday\nnight. I have been wrong ever since.\"\n\nWhen she and her companion met that morning, she reiterated her\ncomplaint of suffering from the toothache; she repeated her refusal\nto allow Mrs. Wragge to procure a remedy; she left the house after\nbreakfast, in the direction of the chemist's shop, exactly as she had\nleft it on the morning before.\n\nThis time she entered the shop without an instant's hesitation.\n\n\"I have got an attack of toothache,\" she said, abruptly, to an elderly\nman who stood behind the counter.\n\n\"May I look at the tooth, miss?\"\n\n\"There is no necessity to look. It is a hollow tooth. I think I have\ncaught cold in it.\"\n\nThe chemist recommended various remedies which were in vogue fifteen\nyears since. She declined purchasing any of them.\n\n\"I have always found Laudanum relieve the pain better than anything\nelse,\" she said, trifling with the bottles on the counter, and looking\nat them while she spoke, instead of looking at the chemist. \"Let me have\nsome Laudanum.\"\n\n\"Certainly, miss. Excuse my asking the question--it is only a matter of\nform. You are staying at Aldborough, I think?\"\n\n\"Yes. I am Miss Bygrave, of North Shingles.\"\n\nThe chemist bowed; and, turning to his shelves, filled an ordinary\nhalf-ounce bottle with laudanum immediately. In ascertaining his\ncustomer's name and address beforehand, the owner of the shop had taken\na precaution which was natural to a careful man, but which was by no\nmeans universal, under similar circumstances, in the state of the law at\nthat time.\n\n\"Shall I put you up a little cotton wool with the laudanum?\" he asked,\nafter he had placed a label on the bottle, and had written a word on it\nin large letters.\n\n\"If you please. What have you just written on the bottle?\" She put the\nquestion sharply, with something of distrust as well as curiosity in her\nmanner.\n\nThe chemist answered the question by turning the label toward her. She\nsaw written on it, in large letters--POISON.\n\n\"I like to be on the safe side, miss,\" said the old man, smiling. \"Very\nworthy people in other respects are often sadly careless where poisons\nare concerned.\"\n\nShe began trifling again with the bottles on the counter, and put\nanother question, with an ill-concealed anxiety to hear the answer.\n\n\"Is there danger,\" she asked, \"in such a little drop of Laudanum as\nthat?\"\n\n\"There is Death in it, miss,\" replied the chemist, quietly.\n\n\"Death to a child, or to a person in delicate health?\"\n\n\"Death to the strongest man in England, let him be who he may.\"\n\nWith that answer, the chemist sealed up the bottle in its wrapping of\nwhite paper and handed the laudanum to Magdalen across the counter. She\nlaughed as she took it from him, and paid for it.\n\n\"There will be no fear of accidents at North Shingles,\" she said. \"I\nshall keep the bottle locked up in my dressing-case. If it doesn't\nrelieve the pain, I must come to you again, and try some other remedy.\nGood-morning.\"\n\n\"Good-morning, miss.\"\n\nShe went straight back to the house without once looking up, without\nnoticing any one who passed her. She brushed by Mrs. Wragge in the\npassage as she might have brushed by a piece of furniture. She\nascended the stairs, and caught her foot twice in her dress, from sheer\ninattention to the common precaution of holding it up. The trivial daily\ninterests of life had lost their hold on her already.\n\nIn the privacy of her own room, she took the bottle from its wrapping,\nand threw the paper and the cotton wool into the fire-place. At the\nmoment when she did this there was a knock at the door. She hid the\nlittle bottle, and looked up impatiently. Mrs. Wragge came into the\nroom.\n\n\"Have you got something for your toothache, my dear?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can I do anything to help you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMrs. Wragge still lingered uneasily near the door. Her manner showed\nplainly that she had something more to say.\n\n\"What is it?\" asked Magdalen, sharply.\n\n\"Don't be angry,\" said Mrs. Wragge. \"I'm not settled in my mind about\nthe captain. He's a great writer, and he hasn't written. He's as quick\nas lightning, and he hasn't come back. Here's Saturday, and no signs of\nhim. Has he run away, do you think? Has anything happened to him?\"\n\n\"I should think not. Go downstairs; I'll come and speak to you about it\ndirectly.\"\n\nAs soon as she was alone again, Magdalen rose from her chair, advanced\ntoward a cupboard in the room which locked, and paused for a moment,\nwith her hand on the key, in doubt. Mrs. Wragge's appearance had\ndisturbed the whole current of her thoughts. Mrs. Wragge's last\nquestion, trifling as it was, had checked her on the verge of the\nprecipice--had roused the old vain hope in her once more of release by\naccident.\n\n\"Why not?\" she said. \"Why may something not have happened to one of\nthem?\"\n\nShe placed the laudanum in the cupboard, locked it, and put the key in\nher packet. \"Time enough still,\" she thought, \"before Monday. I'll wait\ntill the captain comes back.\"\n\nAfter some consultation downstairs, it was agreed that the servant\nshould sit up that night, in expectation of her master's return. The day\npassed quietly, without events of any kind. Magdalen dreamed away the\nhours over a book. A weary patience of expectation was all she felt\nnow--the poignant torment of thought was dulled and blunted at last.\nShe passed the day and the evening in the parlor, vaguely conscious of a\nstrange feeling of aversion to going back to her own room. As the night\nadvanced, as the noises ceased indoors and out, her restlessness began\nto return. She endeavored to quiet herself by reading. Books failed to\nfix her attention. The newspaper was lying in a corner of the room: she\ntried the newspaper next.\n\nShe looked mechanically at the headings of the articles; she listlessly\nturned over page after page, until her wandering attention was arrested\nby the narrative of an Execution in a distant part of England. There was\nnothing to strike her in the story of the crime, and yet she read it. It\nwas a common, horribly common, act of bloodshed--the murder of a woman\nin farm-service by a man in the same employment who was jealous of her.\nHe had been convicted on no extraordinary evidence, he had been hanged\nunder no unusual circumstances. He had made his confession, when he knew\nthere was no hope for him, like other criminals of his class, and the\nnewspaper had printed it at the end of the article, in these terms:\n\n\"I kept company with the deceased for a year or thereabouts. I said I\nwould marry her when I had money enough. She said I had money enough\nnow. We had a quarrel. She refused to walk out with me any more; she\nwouldn't draw me my beer; she took up with my fellow-servant, David\nCrouch. I went to her on the Saturday, and said I would marry her as\nsoon as we could be asked in church if she would give up Crouch. She\nlaughed at me. She turned me out of the wash-house, and the rest of them\nsaw her turn me out. I was not easy in my mind. I went and sat on the\ngate--the gate in the meadow they call Pettit's Piece. I thought I would\nshoot her. I went and fetched my gun and loaded it. I went out into\nPettit's Piece again. I was hard put to it to make up my mind. I thought\nI would try my luck--I mean try whether to kill her or not---by throwing\nup the Spud of the plow into the air. I said to myself, if it falls\nflat, I'll spare her; if it falls point in the earth, I'll kill her. I\ntook a good swing with it, and shied it up. It fell point in the earth.\nI went and shot her. It was a bad job, but I did it. I did it, as they\nsaid I did it at the trial. I hope the Lord will have mercy on me. I\nwish my mother to have my old clothes. I have no more to say.\"\n\nIn the happier days of her life, Magdalen would have passed over the\nnarrative of the execution, and the printed confession which accompanied\nit unread; the subject would have failed to attract her. She read the\nhorrible story now--read it with an interest unintelligible to herself.\nHer attention, which had wandered over higher and better things,\nfollowed every sentence of the murderer's hideously direct confession\nfrom beginning to end. If the man or the woman had been known to her,\nif the place had been familiar to her memory, she could hardly have\nfollowed the narrative more closely, or have felt a more distinct\nimpression of it left on her mind. She laid down the paper, wondering at\nherself; she took it up once more, and tried to read some other portion\nof the contents. The effort was useless; her attention wandered again.\nShe threw the paper away, and went out into the garden. The night\nwas dark; the stars were few and faint. She could just see the\ngravel-walk--she could just pace backward and forward between the house\ndoor and the gate.\n\nThe confession in the newspaper had taken a fearful hold on her mind. As\nshe paced the walk, the black night opened over the sea, and showed her\nthe murderer in the field hurling the Spud of the plow into the air. She\nran, shuddering, back to the house. The murderer followed her into the\nparlor. She seized the candle and went up into her room. The vision of\nher own distempered fancy followed her to the place where the laudanum\nwas hidden, and vanished there.\n\nIt was midnight, and there was no sign yet of the captain's return.\n\nShe took from the writing-case the long letter which she had written\nto Norah, and slowly read it through. The letter quieted her. When she\nreached the blank space left at the end, she hurriedly turned back and\nbegan it over again.\n\nOne o'clock struck from the church clock, and still the captain never\nappeared.\n\nShe read the letter for the second time; she turned back obstinately,\ndespairingly, and began it for the third time. As she once more reached\nthe last page, she looked at her watch. It was a quarter to two. She\nhad just put the watch back in the belt of her dress, when there came to\nher--far off in the stillness of the morning--a sound of wheels.\n\nShe dropped the letter and clasped her cold hands in her lap and\nlistened. The sound came on, faster and faster, nearer and nearer--the\ntrivial sound to all other ears; the sound of Doom to hers. It passed\nthe side of the house; it traveled a little further on; it stopped. She\nheard a loud knocking--then the opening of a window--then voices--then a\nlong silence--than the wheels again coming back--then the opening of the\ndoor below, and the sound of the captain's voice in the passage.\n\nShe could endure it no longer. She opened her door a little way and\ncalled to him.\n\nHe ran upstairs instantly, astonish ed that she was not in bed. She\nspoke to him through the narrow opening of the door, keeping herself\nhidden behind it, for she was afraid to let him see her face.\n\n\"Has anything gone wrong?\" she asked.\n\n\"Make your mind easy,\" he answered. \"Nothing has gone wrong.\"\n\n\"Is no accident likely to happen between this and Monday?\"\n\n\"None whatever. The marriage is a certainty.\"\n\n\"A certainty?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"\n\nShe put her hand out through the door. He took it with some little\nsurprise; it was not often in his experience that she gave him her hand\nof her own accord.\n\n\"You have sat up too long,\" he said, as he felt the clasp of her cold\nfingers. \"I am afraid you will have a bad night--I'm afraid you will not\nsleep.\"\n\nShe softly closed the door.\n\n\"I shall sleep,\" she said, \"sounder than you think for.\"\n\n\nIt was past two o'clock when she shut herself up alone in her room. Her\nchair stood in its customary place by the toilet-table. She sat down for\na few minutes thoughtfully, then opened her letter to Norah, and turned\nto the end where the blank space was left. The last lines written above\nthe space ran thus: \"... I have laid my whole heart bare to you; I\nhave hidden nothing. It has come to this. The end I have toiled for, at\nsuch terrible cost to myself, is an end which I must reach or die. It\nis wickedness, madness, what you will--but it is so. There are now two\njourneys before me to choose between. If I can marry him--the journey\nto the church. If the profanation of myself is more than I can bear--the\njourney to the grave!\"\n\nUnder that last sentence, she wrote these lines:\n\n\"My choice is made. If the cruel law will let you, lay me with my father\nand mother in the churchyard at home. Farewell, my love! Be always\ninnocent; be always happy. If Frank ever asks about me, say I died\nforgiving him. Don't grieve long for me, Norah--I am not worth it.\"\n\nShe sealed the letter, and addressed it to her sister. The tears\ngathered in her eyes as she laid it on the table. She waited until her\nsight was clear again, and then took the banknotes once more from the\nlittle bag in her bosom. After wrapping them in a sheet of note paper,\nshe wrote Captain Wragge's name on the inclosure, and added these words\nbelow it: \"Lock the door of my room, and leave me till my sister comes.\nThe money I promised you is in this. You are not to blame; it is my\nfault, and mine only. If you have any friendly remembrance of me, be\nkind to your wife for my sake.\"\n\nAfter placing the inclosure by the letter to Norah, she rose and looked\nround the room. Some few little things in it were not in their places.\nShe set them in order, and drew the curtains on either side at the head\nof her bed. Her own dress was the next object of her scrutiny. It was\nall as neat, as pure, as prettily arranged as ever. Nothing about her\nwas disordered but her hair. Some tresses had fallen loose on one side\nof her head; she carefully put them back in their places with the help\nof her glass. \"How pale I look!\" she thought, with a faint smile. \"Shall\nI be paler still when they find me in the morning?\"\n\nShe went straight to the place where the laudanum was hidden, and took\nit out. The bottle was so small that it lay easily in the palm of her\nhand. She let it remain there for a little while, and stood looking at\nit.\n\n\"DEATH!\" she said. \"In this drop of brown drink--DEATH!\"\n\nAs the words passed her lips, an agony of unutterable horror seized on\nher in an instant. She crossed the room unsteadily, with a maddening\nconfusion in her head, with a suffocating anguish at her heart. She\ncaught at the table to support herself. The faint clink of the bottle,\nas it fell harmlessly from her loosened grasp and rolled against some\nporcelain object on the table, struck through her brain like the stroke\nof a knife. The sound of her own voice, sunk to a whisper--her voice\nonly uttering that one word, Death--rushed in her ears like the rushing\nof a wind. She dragged herself to the bedside, and rested her head\nagainst it, sitting on the floor. \"Oh, my life! my life!\" she thought;\n\"what is my life worth, that I cling to it like this?\"\n\nAn interval passed, and she felt her strength returning. She raised\nherself on her knees and hid her face on the bed. She tried to pray--to\npray to be forgiven for seeking the refuge of death. Frantic words burst\nfrom her lips--words which would have risen to cries, if she had not\nstifled them in the bed-clothes. She started to her feet; despair\nstrengthened her with a headlong fury against herself. In one moment she\nwas back at the table; in another, the poison was once more in her hand.\n\nShe removed the cork and lifted the bottle to her mouth.\n\nAt the first cold touch of the glass on her lips, her strong young life\nleaped up in her leaping blood, and fought with the whole frenzy of its\nloathing against the close terror of Death. Every active power in\nthe exuberant vital force that was in her rose in revolt against the\ndestruction which her own will would fain have wreaked on her own life.\nShe paused: for the second time, she paused in spite of herself. There,\nin the glorious perfection of her youth and health--there, trembling on\nthe verge of human existence, she stood; with the kiss of the Destroyer\nclose at her lips, and Nature, faithful to its sacred trust, fighting\nfor the salvation of her to the last.\n\nNo word passed her lips. Her cheeks flushed deep; her breath came thick\nand fast. With the poison still in her hand, with the sense that she\nmight faint in another moment, she made for the window, and threw back\nthe curtain that covered it.\n\nThe new day had risen. The broad gray dawn flowed in on her, over the\nquiet eastern sea.\n\nShe saw the waters heaving, large and silent, in the misty calm; she\nfelt the fresh breath of the morning flutter cool on her face. Her\nstrength returned; her mind cleared a little. At the sight of the sea,\nher memory recalled the walk in the garden overnight, and the picture\nwhich her distempered fancy had painted on the black void. In thought,\nshe saw the picture again--the murderer hurling the Spud of the\nplow into the air, and setting the life or death of the woman who had\ndeserted him on the hazard of the falling point. The infection of that\nterrible superstition seized on her mind as suddenly as the new day had\nburst on her view. The premise of release which she saw in it from the\nhorror of her own hesitation roused the last energies of her despair.\nShe resolved to end the struggle by setting her life or death on the\nhazard of a chance.\n\nOn what chance?\n\nThe sea showed it to her. Dimly distinguishable through the mist, she\nsaw a little fleet of coasting-vessels slowly drifting toward the house,\nall following the same direction with the favoring set of the tide. In\nhalf an hour--perhaps in less--the fleet would have passed her window.\nThe hands of her watch pointed to four o'clock. She seated herself close\nat the side of the window, with her back toward the quarter from which\nthe vessels were drifting down on her--with the poison placed on the\nwindow-sill and the watch on her lap. For one half-hour to come she\ndetermined to wait there and count the vessels as they went by. If in\nthat time an even number passed her, the sign given should be a sign to\nlive. If the uneven number prevailed, the end should be Death.\n\nWith that final resolution, she rested her head against the window and\nwaited for the ships to pass.\n\nThe first came, high, dark and near in the mist, gliding silently over\nthe silent sea. An interval--and the second followed, with the third\nclose after it. Another interval, longer and longer drawn out--and\nnothing passed. She looked at her watch. Twelve minutes, and three\nships. Three.\n\nThe fourth came, slower than the rest, larger than the rest, further off\nin the mist than the rest. The interval followed; a long interval once\nmore. Then the next vessel passed, darkest and nearest of all. Five. The\nnext uneven number--\n\nFive.\n\nShe looked at her watch again. Nineteen minutes, and five ships. Twenty\nminutes. Twenty-one, two, three--and no sixth vessel. Twenty-four, and\nthe sixth came by. Twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight,\nand the next uneven number--the fatal Seven--glided into view. Two\nminutes to the end of the half-hour. And seven ships.\n\nTwenty-nine, and nothing followed in the wake of the seventh ship. The\nminute-hand of the watch moved on half-way to thirty, and still the\nwhite heaving sea was a misty blank. Without moving her head from the\nwindow, she took the poison in one hand, and raised the watch in the\nother. As the quick seconds counted each other out, her eyes, as\nquick as they, looked from the watch to the sea, from the sea to the\nwatch--looked for the last time at the sea--and saw the EIGHTH ship.\n\nShe never moved, she never spoke. The death of thought, the death of\nfeeling, seemed to have come to her already. She put back the poison\nmechanically on the ledge of the window and watched, as in a dream, the\nship gliding smoothly on its silent way--gliding till it melted dimly\ninto shadow--gliding till it was lost in the mist.\n\nThe strain on her mind relaxed when the Messenger of Life had passed\nfrom her sight.\n\n\"Providence?\" she whispered faintly to herself. \"Or chance?\"\n\nHer eyes closed, and her head fell back. When the sense of life returned\nto her, the morning sun was warm on her face--the blue heaven looked\ndown on her--and the sea was a sea of gold.\n\nShe fell on her knees at the window and burst into tears.\n\n* * * * *\n\nToward noon that day, the captain, waiting below stairs, and hearing no\nmovement in Magdalen's room, felt uneasy at the long silence. He desired\nthe new maid to follow him upstairs, and, pointing to the door, told her\nto go in softly and see whether her mistress was awake.\n\nThe maid entered the room, remained there a moment, and came out again,\nclosing the door gently.\n\n\"She looks beautiful, sir,\" said the girl; \"and she's sleeping as\nquietly as a new-born child.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE morning of her husband's return to North Shingles was a morning\nmemorable forever in the domestic calendar of Mrs. Wragge. She\ndated from that occasion the first announcement which reached her of\nMagdalen's marriage.\n\nIt had been Mrs. Wragge's earthly lot to pass her life in a state of\nperpetual surprise. Never yet, however, had she wandered in such a maze\nof astonishment as the maze in which she lost herself when the captain\ncoolly told her the truth. She had been sharp enough to suspect Mr.\nNoel Vanstone of coming to the house in the character of a sweetheart\non approval; and she had dimly interpreted certain expressions of\nimpatience which had fallen from Magdalen's lips as boding ill for the\nsuccess of his suit, but her utmost penetration had never reached as far\nas a suspicion of the impending marriage. She rose from one climax of\namazement to another, as her husband proceeded with his disclosure. A\nwedding in the family at a day's notice! and that wedding Magdalen's!\nand not a single new dress ordered for anybody, the bride included! and\nthe Oriental Cashmere Robe totally unavailable on the occasion when\nshe might have worn it to the greatest advantage! Mrs. Wragge\ndropped crookedly into a chair, and beat her disorderly hands on her\nunsymmetrical knees, in utter forgetfulness of the captain's presence\nand the captain's terrible eye. It would not have surprised her to hear\nthat the world had come to an end, and that the only mortal whom Destiny\nhad overlooked, in winding up the affairs of this earthly planet, was\nherself!\n\nLeaving his wife to recover her composure by her own unaided efforts,\nCaptain Wragge withdrew to wait for Magdalen's appearance in the lower\nregions of the house. It was close on one o'clock before the sound of\nfootsteps in the room above warned him that she was awake and stirring.\nHe called at once for the maid (whose name he had ascertained to be\nLouisa), and sent her upstairs to her mistress for the second time.\n\nMagdalen was standing by her dressing-table when a faint tap at the door\nsuddenly roused her. The tap was followed by the sound of a meek voice,\nwhich announced itself as the voice of \"her maid,\" and inquired if Miss\nBygrave needed any assistance that morning.\n\n\"Not at present,\" said Magdalen, as soon as she had recovered the\nsurprise of finding herself unexpectedly provided with an attendant. \"I\nwill ring when I want you.\"\n\nAfter dismissing the woman with that answer, she accidentally looked\nfrom the door to the window. Any speculations on the subject of the\nnew servant in which she might otherwise have engaged were instantly\nsuspended by the sight of the bottle of laudanum, still standing on the\nledge of the window, where she had left it at sunrise. She took it once\nmore in her hand, with a strange confusion of feeling--with a vague\ndoubt even yet, whether the sight of it reminded her of a terrible\nreality or a terrible dream. Her first impulse was to rid herself of\nit on the spot. She raised the bottle to throw the contents out of the\nwindow, and paused, in sudden distrust of the impulse that had come to\nher. \"I have accepted my new life,\" she thought. \"How do I know what\nthat life may have in store for me?\" She turned from the window and went\nback to the table. \"I may be forced to drink it yet,\" she said, and put\nthe laudanum into her dressing-case.\n\nHer mind was not at ease when she had done this: there seemed to be some\nindefinable ingratitude in the act. Still she made no attempt to\nremove the bottle from its hiding-place. She hurried on her toilet; she\nhastened the time when she could ring for the maid, and forget herself\nand her waking thoughts in a new subject. After touching the bell, she\ntook from the table her letter to Norah and her letter to the captain,\nput them both into her dressing-case with the laudanum, and locked it\nsecurely with the key which she kept attached to her watch-chain.\n\nMagdalen's first impression of her attendant was not an agreeable one.\nShe could not investigate the girl with the experienced eye of the\nlandlady at the London hotel, who had characterized the stranger as a\nyoung person overtaken by misfortune, and who had showed plainly, by her\nlook and manner, of what nature she suspected that misfortune to be.\nBut with this drawback, Magdalen was perfectly competent to detect\nthe tokens of sickness and sorrow lurking under the surface of the new\nmaid's activity and politeness. She suspected the girl was ill-tempered;\nshe disliked her name; and she was indisposed to welcome any servant\nwho had been engaged by Noel Vanstone. But after the first few minutes,\n\"Louisa\" grew on her liking. She answered all the questions put to\nher with perfect directness; she appeared to understand her duties\nthoroughly; and she never spoke until she was spoken to first. After\nmaking all the inquiries that occurred to her at the time, and after\ndetermining to give the maid a fair trial, Magdalen rose to leave the\nroom. The very air in it was still heavy to her with the oppression of\nthe past night.\n\n\"Have you anything more to say to me?\" she asked, turning to the\nservant, with her hand on the door.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, miss,\" said Louisa, very respectfully and very\nquietly. \"I think my master told me that the marriage was to be\nto-morrow?\"\n\nMagdalen repressed the shudder that stole over her at that reference to\nthe marriage on the lips of a stranger, and answered in the affirmative.\n\n\"It's a very short time, miss, to prepare in. If you would be so kind as\nto give me my orders about the packing before you go downstairs--?\"\n\n\"There are no such preparations to make as you suppose,\" said Magdalen,\nhastily. \"The few things I have here can be all packed at once, if you\nlike. I shall wear the same dress to-morrow which I have on to-day.\nLeave out the straw bonnet and the light shawl, and put everything else\ninto my boxes. I have no new dresses to pack; I have nothing ordered for\nthe occasion of any sort.\" She tried to add some commonplace phrases of\nexplanation, accounting as probably as might be for the absence of the\nusual wedding outfit and wedding-dress. But no further reference to the\nmarriage would pass her lips, and without an other word she abruptly\nleft the room.\n\nThe meek and melancholy Louisa stood lost in astonishment. \"Something\nwrong here,\" she thought. \"I'm half afraid of my new place already.\" She\nsighed resignedly, shook her head, and went to the wardrobe. She first\nexamined the drawers underneath, took out the various articles of linen\nlaid inside, and placed them on chairs. Opening the upper part of the\nwardrobe next, she ranged the dresses in it side by side on the bed. Her\nlast proceeding was to push the empty boxes into the middle of the room,\nand to compare the space at her disposal with the articles of dress\nwhich she had to pack. She completed her preliminary calculations\nwith the ready self-reliance of a woman who thoroughly understood her\nbusiness, and began the packing forthwith. Just as she had placed the\nfirst article of linen in the smaller box, the door of the room opened,\nand the house-servant, eager for gossip, came in.\n\n\"What do you want?\" asked Louisa, quietly.\n\n\"Did you ever hear of anything like this!\" said the house-servant,\nentering on her subject immediately.\n\n\"Like what?\"\n\n\"Like this marriage, to be sure. You're London bred, they tell me. Did\nyou ever hear of a young lady being married without a single new thing\nto her back? No wedding veil, and no wedding breakfast, and no wedding\nfavors for the servants. It's flying in the face of Providence--that's\nwhat I say. I'm only a poor servant, I know. But it's wicked, downright\nwicked--and I don't care who hears me!\"\n\nLouisa went on with the packing.\n\n\"Look at her dresses!\" persisted the house-servant, waving her hand\nindignantly at the bed. \"I'm only a poor girl, but I wouldn't marry the\nbest man alive without a new gown to my back. Look here! look at this\ndowdy brown thing here. Alpaca! You're not going to pack this Alpaca\nthing, are you? Why, it's hardly fit for a servant! I don't know that\nI'd take a gift of it if it was offered me. It would do for me if I took\nit up in the skirt, and let it out in the waist--and it wouldn't look so\nbad with a bit of bright trimming, would it?\"\n\n\"Let that dress alone, if you please,\" said Louisa, as quietly as ever.\n\n\"What did you say?\" inquired the other, doubting whether her ears had\nnot deceived her.\n\n\"I said, let that dress alone. It belongs to my mistress, and I have my\nmistress's orders to pack up everything in the room. You are not helping\nme by coming here--you are very much in my way.\"\n\n\"Well!\" said the house-servant, \"you may be London bred, as they say.\nBut if these are your London manners, give me Suffolk!\" She opened the\ndoor with an angry snatch at the handle, shut it violently, opened it\nagain, and looked in. \"Give me Suffolk!\" said the house-servant, with a\nparting nod of her head to point the edge of her sarcasm.\n\nLouisa proceeded impenetrably with her packing up.\n\nHaving neatly disposed of the linen in the smaller box, she turned her\nattention to the dresses next. After passing them carefully in review,\nto ascertain which was the least valuable of the collection, and to\nplace that one at the bottom of the trunk for the rest to lie on, she\nmade her choice with very little difficulty. The first gown which she\nput into the box was--the brown Alpaca dress.\n\nMeanwhile Magdalen had joined the captain downstairs. Although he could\nnot fail to notice the languor in her face and the listlessness of all\nher movements, he was relieved to find that she met him with perfect\ncomposure. She was even self-possessed enough to ask him for news of his\njourney, with no other signs of agitation than a passing change of color\nand a little trembling of the lips.\n\n\"So much for the past,\" said Captain Wragge, when his narrative of the\nexpedition to London by way of St. Crux had come to an end. \"Now for the\npresent. The bridegroom--\"\n\n\"If it makes no difference,\" she interposed, \"call him Mr. Noel\nVanstone.\"\n\n\"With all my heart. Mr. Noel Vanstone is coming here this afternoon to\ndine and spend the evening. He will be tiresome in the last degree;\nbut, like all tiresome people, he is not to be got rid of on any terms.\nBefore he comes, I have a last word or two of caution for your private\near. By this time to-morrow we shall have parted--without any certain\nknowledge, on either side, of our ever meeting again. I am anxious to\nserve your interests faithfully to the last; I am anxious you should\nfeel that I have done all I could for your future security when we say\ngood-by.\"\n\nMagdalen looked at him in surprise. He spoke in altered tones. He was\nagitated; he was strangely in earnest. Something in his look and manner\ntook her memory back to the first night at Aldborough, when she had\nopened her mind to him in the darkening solitude--when they two had sat\ntogether alone on the slope of the martello tower. \"I have no reason to\nthink otherwise than kindly of you,\" she said.\n\nCaptain Wragge suddenly left his chair, and took a turn backward and\nforward in the room. Magdalen's last words seemed to have produced some\nextraordinary disturbance in him.\n\n\"Damn it!\" he broke out; \"I can't let you say that. You have reason to\nthink ill of me. I have cheated you. You never got your fair share\nof profit from the Entertainment, from first to last. There! now the\nmurder's out!\"\n\nMagdalen smiled, and signed to him to come back to his chair.\n\n\"I know you cheated me,\" she said, quietly. \"You were in the exercise of\nyour profession, Captain Wragge. I expected it when I joined you. I made\nno complaint at the time, and I make none now. If the money you took is\nany recompense for all the trouble I have given you, you are heartily\nwelcome to it.\"\n\n\"Will you shake hands on that?\" asked the captain, with an awkwardness\nand hesitation strongly at variance with his customary ease of manner.\n\nMagdalen gave him her hand. He wrung it hard. \"You are a strange girl,\"\nhe said, trying to speak lightly. \"You have laid a hold on me that I\ndon't quite understand. I'm half uncomfortable at taking the money from\nyou now; and yet you don't want it, do you?\" He hesitated. \"I almost\nwish,\" he said, \"I had never met you on the Walls of York.\"\n\n\"It is too late to wish that, Captain Wragge. Say no more. You only\ndistress me--say no more. We have other subjects to talk about. What\nwere those words of caution which you had for my private ear?\"\n\nThe captain took another turn in the room, and struggled back again into\nhis every-day character. He produced from his pocketbook Mrs. Lecount's\nletter to her master, and handed it to Magdalen.\n\n\"There is the letter that might have ruined us if it had ever reached\nits address,\" he said. \"Read it carefully. I have a question to ask you\nwhen you have done.\"\n\nMagdalen read the letter. \"What is this proof,\" she inquired, \"which\nMrs. Lecount relies on so confidently!\"\n\n\"The very question I was going to ask you,\" said Captain Wragge.\n\"Consult your memory of what happened when you tried that experiment in\nVauxhall Walk. Did Mrs. Lecount get no other chance against you than the\nchances you have told me of already?\"\n\n\"She discovered that my face was disguised, and she heard me speak in my\nown voice.\"\n\n\"And nothing more?\"\n\n\"Nothing more.\"\n\n\"Very good. Then my interpretation of the letter is clearly the right\none. The proof Mrs. Lecount relies on is my wife's infernal ghost\nstory--which is, in plain English, the story of Miss Bygrave having been\nseen in Miss Vanstone's disguise; the witness being the very person who\nis afterward presented at Aldborough in the character of Miss Bygrave's\naunt. An excellent chance for Mrs. Lecount, if she can only lay her hand\nat the right time on Mrs. Wragge, and no chance at all, if she can't.\nMake your mind easy on that point. Mrs. Lecount and my wife have seen\nthe last of each other. In the meantime, don't neglect the warning I\ngive you, in giving you this letter. Tear it up, for fear of accidents,\nbut don't forget it.\"\n\n\"Trust me to remember it,\" replied Magdalen, destroying the letter while\nshe spoke. \"Have you anything more to tell me?\"\n\n\"I have some information to give you,\" said Captain Wragge, \"which may\nbe useful, because it relates to your future security. Mind, I want to\nknow nothing about your proceedings when to-morrow is over; we settled\nthat when we first discussed this matter. I ask no questions, and I make\nno guesses. All I want to do now is to warn you of your legal position\nafter your marriage, and to leave you to make what use you please of\nyour knowledge, at your own sole discretion. I took a lawyer's opinion\non the point when I was in London, thinking it might be useful to you.\"\n\n\"It is sure to be useful. What did the lawyer say?\"\n\n\"To put it plainly, this is what he said. If Mr. Noel Vanstone ever\ndiscovers that you have knowingly married him under a false name, he can\napply to the Ecclesiastical Court to have his marriage declared null and\nvoid. The issue of the application would rest with the judges. But if he\ncould prove that he had been intentionally deceived, the legal opinion\nis that his case would be a strong one.\"\n\n\"Suppose I chose to apply on my side?\" said Magdalen, eagerly. \"What\nthen?\"\n\n\"You might make the application,\" replied the captain. \"But remember\none thing--you would come into Court with the acknowledgment of your own\ndeception. I leave you to imagine what the judges would think of that.\"\n\n\"Did the lawyer tell you anything else?\"\n\n\"One thing besides,\" said Captain Wragge. \"Whatever the law might do\nwith the marriage in the lifetime of both the parties to it--on the\ndeath of either one of them, no application made by the survivor would\navail; and, as to the case of that survivor, the marriage would remain\nvalid. You understand? If he dies, or if you die--and if no application\nhas been made to the Court--he the survivor, or you the survivor, would\nhave no power of disputing the marriage. But in the lifetime of both of\nyou, if he claimed to have the marriage dissolved, the chances are all\nin favor of his carrying his point.\"\n\nHe looked at Magdalen with a furtive curiosity as he said those words.\nShe turned her head aside, absently tying her watch-chain into a loop\nand untying it again, evidently thinking with the closest attention\nover what he had last said to her. Captain Wragge walked uneasily to the\nwindow and looked out. The first object that caught his eye was Mr. Noel\nVanstone approaching from Sea View. He returned instantly to his former\nplace in the room, and addressed himself to Magdalen once more.\n\n\"Here is Mr. Noel Vanstone,\" he said. \"One last caution before he comes\nin. Be on your guard with him about your age. He put the question to\nme before he got the License. I took the shortest way out of the\ndifficulty, and told him you were twenty-one, and he made the\ndeclaration accordingly. Never mind about _me_; after to-morrow I am\ninvisible. But, in your own interests, don't forget, if the subject\nturns up, that you were of age when you were married. There is nothing\nmore. You are provided with every necessary warning that I can give you.\nWhatever happens in the future, remember I have done my best.\"\n\nHe hurried to the door without waiting for an answer, and went out into\nthe garden to receive his guest.\n\nNoel Vanstone made his appearance at the gate, solemnly carrying\nhis bridal offering to North Shingles with both hands. The object in\nquestion was an ancient casket (one of his father's bargains); inside\nthe casket reposed an old-fashioned carbuncle brooch, set in silver\n(another of his father's bargains)--bridal presents both, possessing\nthe inestimable merit of leaving his money undisturbed in his pocket. He\nshook his head portentously when the captain inquired after his health\nand spirits. He had passed a wakeful night; ungovernable apprehensions\nof Lecount's sudden re-appearance had beset him as soon as he found\nhimself alone at Sea View. Sea View was redolent of Lecount: Sea\nView (though built on piles, and the strongest house in England) was\nhenceforth odious to him. He had felt this all night; he had also felt\nhis responsibilities. There was the lady's maid, to begin with. Now he\nhad hired her, he began to think she wouldn't do. She might fall sick on\nhis hands; she might have deceived him by a false character; she and\nthe landlady of the hotel might have been in league together.\nHorrible! Really horrible to think of. Then there was the other\nresponsibility--perhaps the heavier of the two--the responsibility of\ndeciding where he was to go and spend his honeymoon to-morrow. He would\nhave preferred one of his father's empty houses: But except at Vauxhall\nWalk (which he supposed would be objected to), and at Aldborough (which\nwas of course out of the question) all the houses were let. He would\nput himself in Mr. Bygrave's hands. Where had Mr. Bygrave spent his own\nhoneymoon? Given the British Islands to choose from, where would Mr.\nBygrave pitch his tent, on a careful review of all the circumstances?\n\nAt this point the bridegroom's questions suddenly came to an end,\nand the bridegroom's face exhibited an expression of ungovernable\nastonishment. His judicious friend, whose advice had been at his\ndisposal in every other emergency, suddenly turned round on him, in the\nemergency of the honeymoon, and flatly declined discussing the subject.\n\n\"No!\" said the captain, as Noel Vanstone opened his lips to plead for a\nhearing, \"you must really excuse me. My point of view in this matter is,\nas usual, a peculiar one. For some time past I have been living in an\natmosphere of deception, to suit your convenience. That atmosphere, my\ngood sir, is getting close; my Moral Being requires ventilation. Settle\nthe choice of a locality with my niece, and leave me, at my particular\nrequest, in total ignorance of the subject. Mrs. Lecount is certain to\ncome here on her return from Zurich, and is certain to ask me where you\nare gone. You may think it strange, Mr. Vanstone; but when I tell her I\ndon't know, I wish to enjoy the unaccustomed luxury of feeling, for once\nin a way, that I am speaking the truth!\"\n\nWith those words, he opened the sitting-room door, introduced Noel\nVanstone to Magdalen's presence, bowed himself out of the room again,\nand set forth alone to while away the rest of the afternoon by taking\na walk. His face showed plain tokens of anxiety, and his party-colored\neyes looked hither and thither distrustfully, as he sauntered along the\nshore. \"The time hangs heavy on our hands,\" thought the captain. \"I wish\nto-morrow was come and gone.\"\n\n\nThe day passed and nothing happened; the evening and the night followed,\nplacidly and uneventfully. Monday came, a cloudless, lovely day; Monday\nconfirmed the captain's assertion that the marriage was a certainty.\nToward ten o'clock, the clerk, ascending the church steps quoted the old\nproverb to the pew-opener, meeting him under the porch: \"Happy the bride\non whom the sun shines!\"\n\nIn a quarter of an hour more the wedding-party was in the vestry, and\nthe clergyman led the way to the altar. Carefully as the secret of the\nmarriage had been kept, the opening of the church in the morning had\nbeen enough to betray it. A small congregation, almost entirely composed\nof women, were scattered here and there among the pews. Kirke's sister\nand her children were staying with a friend at Aldborough, and Kirke's\nsister was one of the congregation.\n\nAs the wedding-party entered the church, the haunting terror of Mrs.\nLecount spread from Noel Vanstone to the captain. For the first few\nminutes, the eyes of both of them looked among the women in the pews\nwith the same searching scrutiny, and looked away again with the same\nsense of relief. The clergyman noticed that look, and investigated the\nLicense more closely than usual. The clerk began to doubt privately\nwhether the old proverb about the bride was a proverb to be always\ndepended on. The female members of the congregation murmured among\nthemselves at the inexcusable disregard of appearances implied in the\nbride's dress. Kirke's sister whispered venomously in her friend's ear,\n\"Thank God for to-day for Robert's sake.\" Mrs. Wragge cried silently,\nwith the dread of some threatening calamity she knew not what. The one\nperson present who remained outwardly undisturbed was Magdalen\nherself. She stood, with tearless resignation, in her place before the\naltar--stood, as if all the sources of human emotion were frozen up\nwithin her.\n\nThe clergyman opened the Book.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was done. The awful words which speak from earth to Heaven were\npronounced. The children of the two dead brothers--inheritors of the\nimplacable enmity which had parted their parents--were Man and Wife.\n\nFrom that moment events hurried with a headlong rapidity to the parting\nscene. They were back at the house while the words of the Marriage\nService seemed still ringing in their ears. Before they had been five\nminutes indoors the carriage drew up at the garden gate. In a minute\nmore the opportunity came for which Magdalen and the captain had been on\nthe watch--the opportunity of speaking together in private for the last\ntime. She still preserved her icy resignation; she seemed beyond all\nreach now of the fear that had once mastered her, of the remorse that\nhad once tortured her soul. With a firm hand she gave him the promised\nmoney. With a firm face she looked her last at him. \"I'm not to blame,\"\nhe whispered, eagerly; \"I have only done what you asked me.\" She bowed\nher head; she bent it toward him kindly and let him touch her fore-head\nwith his lips. \"Take care!\" he said. \"My last words are--for God's sake\ntake care when I'm gone!\" She turned from him with a smile, and spoke\nher farewell words to his wife. Mrs. Wragge tried hard to face her loss\nbravely--the loss of the friend whose presence had fallen like light\nfrom Heaven over the dim pathway of her life. \"You have been very good\nto me, my dear; I thank you kindly; I thank you with all my heart.\" She\ncould say no more; she clung to Magdalen in a passion of tears, as her\nmother might have clung to her, if her mother had lived to see that\nhorrible day. \"I'm frightened for you!\" cried the poor creature, in a\nwild, wailing voice. \"Oh, my darling, I'm frightened for you!\" Magdalen\ndesperately drew herself free--kissed her--and hurried out to the door.\nThe expression of that artless gratitude, the cry of that guileless\nlove, shook her as nothing else had shaken her that day. It was a refuge\nto get to the carriage--a refuge, though the man she had married stood\nthere waiting for her at the door.\n\nMrs. Wragge tried to follow her into the garden. But the captain had\nseen Magdalen's face as she ran out, and he steadily held his wife back\nin the passage. From that distance the last farewells were exchanged.\nAs long as the carriage was in sight, Magdalen looked back at them; she\nwaved her handkerchief as she turned the corner. In a moment more\nthe last thread which bound her to them was broken; the familiar\ncompanionship of many months was a thing of the past already!\n\nCaptain Wragge closed the house door on the idlers who were looking in\nfrom the Parade. He led his wife back into the sitting-room, and spoke\nto her with a forbearance which she had never yet experienced from him.\n\n\"She has gone her way,\" he said, \"and in another hour we shall have gone\nours. Cry your cry out--I don't deny she's worth crying for.\"\n\nEven then--even when the dread of Magdalen's future was at its\ndarkest in his mind--the ruling habit of the man's life clung to him.\nMechanically he unlocked his dispatch-box. Mechanically he opened his\nBook of Accounts, and made the closing entry--the entry of his last\ntransaction with Magdalen--in black and white. \"By Rec'd from Miss\nVanstone,\" wrote the captain, with a gloomy brow, \"Two hundred pounds.\"\n\n\"You won't be angry with me?\" said Mrs. Wragge, looking timidly at her\nhusband through her tears. \"I want a word of comfort, captain. Oh, do\ntell me, when shall I see her again?\"\n\nThe captain closed the book, and answered in one inexorable word:\n\"Never!\"\n\n\nBetween eleven and twelve o'clock that night Mrs. Lecount drove into\nZurich.\n\nHer brother's house, when she stopped before it, was shut up. With some\ndifficulty and delay the servant was aroused. She held up her hands in\nspeechless amazement when she opened the door and saw who the visitor\nwas.\n\n\"Is my brother alive?\" asked Mrs. Lecount, entering the house.\n\n\"Alive!\" echoed the servant. \"He has gone holiday-making into the\ncountry, to finish his recovery in the fine fresh air.\"\n\nThe housekeeper staggered back against the wall of the passage. The\ncoachman and the servant put her into a chair. Her face was livid, and\nher teeth chattered in her head.\n\n\"Send for my brother's doctor,\" she said, as soon as she could speak.\n\nThe doctor came. She handed him a letter before he could say a word.\n\n\"Did you write that letter?\"\n\nHe looked it over rapidly, and answered her without hesitation,\n\n\"Certainly not!\"\n\n\"It is your handwriting.\"\n\n\"It is a forgery of my handwriting.\"\n\nShe rose from the chair with a new strength in her.\n\n\"When does the return mail start for Paris?\" she asked.\n\n\"In half an hour.\"\n\n\"Send instantly and take me a place in it!\"\n\nThe servant hesitated, the doctor protested. She turned a deaf ear to\nthem both.\n\n\"Send!\" she reiterated, \"or I will go myself.\"\n\nThey obeyed. The servant went to take the place: the doctor remained and\nheld a conversation with Mrs. Lecount. When the half-hour had passed,\nhe helped her into her place in the mail, and charged the conductor\nprivately to take care of his passenger.\n\n\"She has traveled from England without stopping,\" said the doctor; \"and\nshe is traveling back again without rest. Be careful of her, or she will\nbreak down under the double journey.\"\n\nThe mail started. Before the first hour of the new day was at an end\nMrs. Lecount was on her way back to England.\n\nTHE END OF THE FOURTH SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\n\nI.\n\n_From George Bartram to Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"St. Crux, September 4th, 1847.\n\n\"MY DEAR NOEL--Here are two plain questions at starting. In the name of\nall that is mysterious, what are you hiding for? And why is everything\nrelating to your marriage kept an impenetrable secret from your oldest\nfriends?\n\n\"I have been to Aldborough to try if I could trace you from that place,\nand have come back as wise as I went. I have applied to your lawyer in\nLondon, and have been told, in reply, that you have forbidden him to\ndisclose the place of your retreat to any one without first receiving\nyour permission to do so. All I could prevail on him to say was, that\nhe would forward any letter which might be sent to his care. I write\naccordingly, and mind this, I expect an answer.\n\n\"You may ask, in your ill-tempered way, what business I have to meddle\nwith affairs of yours which it is your pleasure to keep private. My dear\nNoel, there is a serious reason for our opening communications with you\nfrom this house. You don't know what events have taken place at St. Crux\nsince you ran away to get married; and though I detest writing letters,\nI must lose an hour's shooting to-day in trying to enlighten you.\n\n\"On the twenty-third of last month, the admiral and I were disturbed\nover our wine after dinner by the announcement that a visitor had\nunexpectedly arrived at St. Crux. Who do you think the visitor was? Mrs.\nLecount!\n\n\"My uncle, with that old-fashioned bachelor gallantry of his which pays\nequal respect to all wearers of petticoats, left the table directly to\nwelcome Mrs. Lecount. While I was debating whether I should follow him\nor not, my meditations were suddenly brought to an end by a loud call\nfrom the admiral. I ran into the morning-room, and there was your\nunfortunate housekeeper on the sofa, with all the women servants about\nher, more dead than alive. She had traveled from England to Zurich, and\nfrom Zurich back again to England, without stopping; and she looked,\nseriously and literally, at death's door. I immediately agreed with my\nuncle that the first thing to be done was to send for medical help. We\ndispatched a groom on the spot, and, at Mrs. Lecount's own request, sent\nall the servants in a body out of the room.\n\n\"As soon as we were alone, Mrs. Lecount surprised us by a singular\nquestion. She asked if you had received a letter which she had addressed\nto you before leaving England at this house. When we told her that the\nletter had been forwarded, under cover to your friend Mr. Bygrave, by\nyour own particular request, she turned as pale as ashes; and when we\nadded that you had left us in company with this same Mr. Bygrave, she\nclasped her hands and stared at us as if she had taken leave of her\nsenses. Her next question was, 'Where is Mr. Noel now?' We could only\ngive her one reply--Mr. Noel had not informed us. She looked perfectly\nthunderstruck at that answer. 'He has gone to his ruin!' she said. 'He\nhas gone away in company with the greatest villain in England. I must\nfind him! I tell you I must find Mr. Noel! If I don't find him at\nonce, it will be too late. He will be married!' she burst out quite\nfrantically. 'On my honor and my oath, he will be married!' The admiral,\nincautiously perhaps, but with the best intentions, told her you were\nmarried already. She gave a scream that made the windows ring again and\ndropped back on the sofa in a fainting-fit. The doctor came in the nick\nof time, and soon brought her to. But she was taken ill the same night;\nshe has grown worse and worse ever since; and the last medical report\nis, that the fever from which she has been suffering is in a fair way to\nsettle on her brain.\n\n\"Now, my dear Noel, neither my uncle nor I have any wish to intrude\nourselves on your confidence. We are naturally astonished at the\nextraordinary mystery which hangs over you and your marriage, and we\ncannot be blind to the fact that your housekeeper has, apparently, some\nstrong reason of her own for viewing Mrs. Noel Vanstone with an enmity\nand distrust which we are quite ready to believe that lady has done\nnothing to deserve. Whatever strange misunderstanding there may have\nbeen in your household, is your business (if you choose to keep it to\nyourself), and not ours. All we have any right to do is to tell you what\nthe doctor says. His patient has been delirious; he declines to\nanswer for her life if she goes on as she is going on now; and he\nthinks--finding that she is perpetually talking of her master--that\nyour presence would be useful in quieting her, if you could come here at\nonce, and exert your influence before it is too late.\n\n\"What do you say? Will you emerge from the darkness that surrounds you\nand come to St. Crux? If this was the case of an ordinary servant, I\ncould understand your hesitating to leave the delights of your honeymoon\nfor any such object as is here proposed to you. But, my dear fellow,\nMrs. Lecount is not an ordinary servant. You are under obligations to\nher fidelity and attachment in your father's time, as well as in your\nown; and if you _can_ quiet the anxieties which seem to be driving this\nunfortunate woman mad, I really think you ought to come here and do so.\nYour leaving Mrs. Noel Vanstone is of course out of the question.\nThere is no necessity for any such hard-hearted proceeding. The admiral\ndesires me to remind you that he is your oldest friend living, and that\nhis house is at your wife's disposal, as it has always been at yours.\nIn this great rambling-place she need dread no near association with\nthe sick-room; and, with all my uncle's oddities, I am sure she will not\nthink the offer of his friendship an offer to be despised.\n\n\"Have I told you already that I went to Aldborough to try and find a\nclew to your whereabouts? I can't be at the trouble of looking back to\nsee; so, if I have told you, I tell you again. The truth is, I made\nan acquaintance at Aldborough of whom you know something--at least by\nreport.\n\n\"After applying vainly at Sea View, I went to the hotel to inquire\nabout you. The landlady could give me no information; but the moment I\nmentioned your name, she asked if I was related to you; and when I told\nher I was your cousin, she said there was a young lady then at the hotel\nwhose name was Vanstone also, who was in great distress about a missing\nrelative, and who might prove of some use to me--or I to her--if we knew\nof each other's errand at Aldborough. I had not the least idea who she\nwas, but I sent in my card at a venture; and in five minutes afterward\nI found myself in the presence of one of the most charming women these\neyes ever looked on.\n\n\"Our first words of explanation informed me that my family name was\nknown to her by repute. Who do you think she was? The eldest daughter of\nmy uncle and yours--Andrew Vanstone. I had often heard my poor mother in\npast years speak of her brother Andrew, and I knew of that sad story\nat Combe-Raven. But our families, as you are aware, had always been\nestranged, and I had never seen my charming cousin before. She has\nthe dark eyes and hair, and the gentle, retiring manners that I always\nadmire in a woman. I don't want to renew our old disagreement about\nyour father's conduct to those two sisters, or to deny that his brother\nAndrew may have behaved badly to him; I am willing to admit that the\nhigh moral position he took in the matter is quite unassailable by\nsuch a miserable sinner as I am; and I will not dispute that my own\nspendthrift habits incapacitate me from offering any opinion on the\nconduct of other people's pecuniary affairs. But, with all these\nallowances and drawbacks, I can tell you one thing, Noel. If you ever\nsee the elder Miss Vanstone, I venture to prophesy that, for the first\ntime in your life, you will doubt the propriety of following your\nfather's example.\n\n\"She told me her little story, poor thing, most simply and unaffectedly.\nShe is now occupying her second situation as a governess--and, as usual,\nI, who know everybody, know the family. They are friends of my uncle's,\nwhom he has lost sight of latterly--the Tyrrels of Portland Place--and\nthey treat Miss Vanstone with as much kindness and consideration as if\nshe was a member of the family. One of their old servants accompanied\nher to Aldborough, her object in traveling to that place being what the\nlandlady of the hotel had stated it to be. The family reverses have, it\nseems, had a serious effect on Miss Vanstone's younger sister, who has\nleft her friends and who has been missing from home for some time.\nShe had been last heard of at Aldborough; and her elder sister, on her\nreturn from the Continent with the Tyrrels, had instantly set out to\nmake inquiries at that place.\n\n\"This was all Miss Vanstone told me. She asked whether you had seen\nanything of her sister, or whether Mrs. Lecount knew anything of her\nsister--I suppose because she was aware you had been at Aldborough.\nOf course I could tell her nothing. She entered into no details on the\nsubject, and I could not presume to ask her for any. All I did was to\nset to work with might and main to assist her inquiries. The attempt\nwas an utter failure; nobody could give us any information. We tried\npersonal description of course; and strange to say, the only young lady\nformerly staying at Aldborough who answered the description was, of all\nthe people in the world, the lady you have married! If she had not had\nan uncle and aunt (both of whom have left the place), I should have\nbegun to suspect that you had married your cousin without knowing it!\nIs this the clew to the mystery? Don't be angry; I must have my little\njoke, and I can't help writing as carelessly as I talk. The end of\nit was, our inquiries were all baffled, and I traveled back with Miss\nVanstone and her attendant as far as our station here. I think I shall\ncall on the Tyrrels when I am next in London. I have certainly treated\nthat family with the most inexcusable neglect.\n\n\"Here I am at the end of my third sheet of note-paper! I don't often\ntake the pen in hand; but when I do, you will agree with me that I am in\nno hurry to lay it aside again. Treat the rest of my letter as you like,\nbut consider what I have told you about Mrs. Lecount, and remember that\ntime is of consequence.\n\n\"Ever yours,\n\n\"GEORGE BARTRAM.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n_From Norah Vanstone to Miss Garth._\n\n\"Portland Place.\n\n\"MY DEAR MISS GARTH--More sorrow, more disappointment! I have just\nreturned from Aldborough, without making any discovery. Magdalen is\nstill lost to us.\n\n\"I cannot attribute this new overthrow of my hopes to any want of\nperseverance or penetration in making the necessary inquiries. My\ninexperience in such matters was most kindly and unexpectedly assisted\nby Mr. George Bartram. By a strange coincidence, he happened to be at\nAldborough, inquiring after Mr. Noel Vanstone, at the very time when I\nwas there inquiring aft er Magdalen. He sent in his card, and knowing,\nwhen I looked at the name, that he was my cousin--if I may call him\nso--I thought there would be no impropriety in my seeing him and asking\nhis advice. I abstained from entering into particulars for Magdalen's\nsake, and I made no allusion to that letter of Mrs. Lecount's which you\nanswered for me. I only told him Magdalen was missing, and had been last\nheard of at Aldborough. The kindness which he showed in devoting himself\nto my assistance exceeds all description. He treated me, in my forlorn\nsituation, with a delicacy and respect which I shall remember gratefully\nlong after he has himself perhaps forgotten our meeting altogether.\nHe is quite young--not more than thirty, I should think. In face\nand figure, he reminded me a little of the portrait of my father at\nCombe-Raven--I mean the portrait in the dining-room, of my father when\nhe was a young man.\n\n\"Useless as our inquiries were, there is one result of them which has\nleft a very strange and shocking impression on my mind.\n\n\"It appears that Mr. Noel Vanstone has lately married, under mysterious\ncircumstances, a young lady whom he met with at Aldborough, named\nBygrave. He has gone away with his wife, telling nobody but his lawyer\nwhere he has gone to. This I heard from Mr. George Bartram, who was\nendeavoring to trace him, for the purpose of communicating the news of\nhis housekeeper's serious illness--the housekeeper being the same Mrs.\nLecount whose letter you answered. So far, you may say, there is nothing\nwhich need particularly interest either of us. But I think you will be\nas much surprised as I was when I tell you that the description given\nby the people at Aldborough of Miss Bygrave's appearance is most\nstartlingly and unaccountably like the description of Magdalen's\nappearance. This discovery, taken in connection with all the\ncircumstances we know of, has had an effect on my mind which I cannot\ndescribe to you--which I dare not realize to myself. Pray come and see\nme! I have never felt so wretched about Magdalen as I feel now. Suspense\nmust have weakened my nerves in some strange way. I feel superstitious\nabout the slightest things. This accidental resemblance of a total\nstranger to Magdalen fills me every now and then with the most horrible\nmisgivings--merely because Mr. Noel Vanstone's name happens to be mixed\nup with it. Once more, pray come to me; I have so much to say to you\nthat I cannot, and dare not, say in writing.\n\n\"Gratefully and affectionately yours,\n\n\"NORAH.\"\n\n\nIII.\n\n_From Mr. John Loscombe (Solicitor) to George Bartram, Esq._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn, London, September 6th, 1847.\n\n\"SIR--I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your note, inclosing a letter\naddressed to my client, Mr. Noel Vanstone, and requesting that I will\nforward the same to Mr. Vanstone's present address.\n\n\"Since I last had the pleasure of communicating with you on this\nsubject, my position toward my client is entirely altered. Three days\nago I received a letter from him, which stated his intention of changing\nhis place of residence on the next day then ensuing, but which left me\nentirely in ignorance on the subject of the locality to which it was\nhis intention to remove. I have not heard from him since; and, as he had\npreviously drawn on me for a larger sum of money than usual, there would\nbe no present necessity for his writing to me again--assuming that it is\nhis wish to keep his place of residence concealed from every one, myself\nincluded.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, I think it right to return you your letter,\nwith the assurance that I will let you know, if I happen to be again\nplaced in a position to forward it to its destination.\n\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\n_From Norah Vanstone to Miss Garth._\n\n\"Portland Place.\n\n\"MY DEAR MISS GARTH--Forget the letter I wrote to you yesterday, and all\nthe gloomy forebodings that it contains. This morning's post has brought\nnew life to me. I have just received a letter, addressed to me at your\nhouse, and forwarded here, in your absence from home yesterday, by your\nsister. Can you guess who the writer is?--Magdalen!\n\n\"The letter is very short; it seems to have been written in a hurry. She\nsays she has been dreaming of me for some nights past, and the dreams\nhave made her fear that her long silence has caused me more distress on\nher account than she is worth. She writes, therefore, to assure me that\nshe is safe and well--that she hopes to see me before long--and that she\nhas something to tell me, when we meet, which will try my sisterly love\nfor her as nothing has tried it yet. The letter is not dated; but\nthe postmark is 'Allonby,' which I have found, on referring to the\nGazetteer, to be a little sea-side place in Cumberland. There is no hope\nof my being able to write back, for Magdalen expressly says that she is\non the eve of departure from her present residence, and that she is not\nat liberty to say where she is going to next, or to leave instructions\nfor forwarding any letters after her.\n\n\"In happier times I should have thought this letter very far from being\na satisfactory one, and I should have been seriously alarmed by that\nallusion to a future confidence on her part which will try my love\nfor her as nothing has tried it yet. But after all the suspense I have\nsuffered, the happiness of seeing her handwriting again seems to fill\nmy heart and to keep all other feelings out of it. I don't send you her\nletter, because I know you are coming to me soon, and I want to have the\npleasure of seeing you read it.\n\n\"Ever affectionately yours,\n\n\"NORAH.\n\n\"P.S.--Mr. George Bartram called on Mrs. Tyrrel to-day. He insisted on\nbeing introduced to the children. When he was gone, Mrs. Tyrrel laughed\nin her good-humored way, and said that his anxiety to see the children\nlooked, to her mind, very much like an anxiety to see _me_. You may\nimagine how my spirits are improved when I can occupy my pen in writing\nsuch nonsense as this!\"\n\n\nV.\n\n_From Mrs. Lecount to Mr. de Bleriot, General Agent, London._\n\n\"St. Crux, October 23d, 1847.\n\n\"DEAR SIR--I have been long in thanking you for the kind letter which\npromises me your assistance, in friendly remembrance of the commercial\nrelations formerly existing between my brother and yourself. The\ntruth is, I have over-taxed my strength on my recovery from a long and\ndangerous illness; and for the last ten days I have been suffering under\na relapse. I am now better again, and able to enter on the business\nwhich you so kindly offer to undertake for me.\n\n\"The person whose present place of abode it is of the utmost importance\nto me to discover is Mr. Noel Vanstone. I have lived, for many years\npast, in this gentleman's service as house-keeper; and not having\nreceived my formal dismissal, I consider myself in his service\nstill. During my absence on the Continent he was privately married\nat Aldborough, in Suffolk, on the eighteenth of August last. He left\nAldborough the same day, taking his wife with him to some place of\nretreat which was kept a secret from everybody except his lawyer, Mr.\nLoscombe, of Lincoln's Inn. After a short time he again removed, on the\n4th of September, without informing Mr. Loscombe, on this occasion, of\nhis new place of abode. From that date to this the lawyer has remained\n(or has pretended to remain) in total ignorance of where he now is.\nApplication has been made to Mr. Loscombe, under the circumstances, to\nmention what that former place of residence was, of which Mr. Vanstone\nis known to have informed him. Mr. Loscombe has declined acceding to\nthis request, for want of formal permission to disclose his client's\nproceedings after leaving Aldborough. I have all these latter\nparticulars from Mr. Loscombe's correspondent--the nephew of the\ngentleman who owns this house, and whose charity has given me an asylum,\nduring the heavy affliction of my sickness, under his own roof.\n\n\"I believe the reasons which have induced Mr. Noel Vanstone to keep\nhimself and his wife in hiding are reasons which relate entirely to\nmyself. In the first place, he is aware that the circumstances under\nwhich he has married are such as to give me the right of regarding him\nwith a just indignation. In the second place, he knows that my faithful\nservices, rendered through a period of twenty years, to his father and\nto himself, forbid him, in common decency, to cast me out helpless on\nthe world without a provision for the end of my life. He is the meanest\nof living men, and his wife is the vilest of living women. As long as\nhe can avoid fulfilling his obligations to me, he will; and his wife's\nencouragement may be trusted to fortify him in his ingratitude.\n\n\"My object in determining to find him out is briefly this. His marriage\nhas exposed him to consequences which a man of ten times his courage\ncould not face without shrinking. Of those consequences he knows\nnothing. His wife knows, and keeps him in ignorance. I know, and can\nenlighten him. His security from the danger that threatens him is in\nmy hands alone; and he shall pay the price of his rescue to the last\nfarthing of the debt that justice claims for me as my due--no more, and\nno less.\n\n\"I have now laid my mind before you, as you told me, without reserve.\nYou know why I want to find this man, and what I mean to do when I find\nhim. I leave it to your sympathy for me to answer the serious question\nthat remains: How is the discovery to be made? If a first trace of them\ncan be found, after their departure from Aldborough, I believe careful\ninquiry will suffice for the rest. The personal appearance of the wife,\nand the extraordinary contrast between her husband and herself, are\ncertain to be remarked, and remembered, by every stranger who sees them.\n\n\"When you favor me with your answer, please address it to 'Care of\nAdmiral Bartram, St. Crux-in the-Marsh, near Ossory, Essex'. Your much\nobliged\n\n\"VIRGINIE LECOUNT.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\n_From Mr. de Bleriot to Mrs. Lecount._\n\n\"Dark's Buildings, Kingsland,\n\n\"October 25th, 1847.\n\n\"Private and Confidential.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--I hasten to reply to your favor of Saturday's date.\nCircumstances have enabled me to forward your interests, by consulting a\nfriend of mine possessing great experience in the management of private\ninquiries of all sorts. I have placed your case before him (without\nmentioning names); and I am happy to inform you that my views and his\nviews of the proper course to take agree in every particular.\n\n\"Both myself and friend, then, are of opinion that little or nothing can\nbe done toward tracing the parties you mention, until the place of\ntheir temporary residence after they left Aldborough has been discovered\nfirst. If this can be done, the sooner it is done the better. Judging\nfrom your letter, some weeks must have passed since the lawyer received\nhis information that they had shifted their quarters. As they are both\nremarkable-looking people, the strangers who may have assisted them\non their travels have probably not forgotten them yet. Nevertheless,\nexpedition is desirable.\n\n\"The question for you to consider is, whether they may not possibly have\ncommunicated the address of which we stand in need to some other person\nbesides the lawyer. The husband may have written to members of his\nfamily, or the wife may have written to members of her family. Both\nmyself and friend are of opinion that the latter chance is the likelier\nof the two. If you have any means of access in the direction of the\nwife's family, we strongly recommend you to make use of them. If not,\nplease supply us with the names of any of her near relations or intimate\nfemale friends whom you know, and we will endeavor to get access for\nyou.\n\n\"In any case, we request you will at once favor us with the most exact\npersonal description that can be written of both the parties. We may\nrequire your assistance, in this important particular, at five minutes'\nnotice. Favor us, therefore, with the description by return of post.\nIn the meantime, we will endeavor to ascertain on our side whether any\ninformation is to be privately obtained at Mr. Loscombe's office. The\nlawyer himself is probably altogether beyond our reach. But if any one\nof his clerks can be advantageously treated with on such terms as may\nnot overtax your pecuniary resources, accept my assurance that the\nopportunity shall be made the most of by, dear madam, your faithful\nservant,\n\n\"ALFRED DE BLERIOT.\"\n\n\nVII.\n\n_From Mr. Pendril to Norah Vanstone._\n\n\"Serle Street, October 27th. 1847.\n\n\"MY DEAR MISS VANSTONE--A lady named Lecount (formerly attached to Mr.\nNoel Vanstone's service in the capacity of housekeeper) has called at my\noffice this morning, and has asked me to furnish her with your address.\nI have begged her to excuse my immediate compliance with her request,\nand to favor me with a call to-morrow morning, when I shall be prepared\nto meet her with a definite answer.\n\n\"My hesitation in this matter does not proceed from any distrust of Mrs.\nLecount personally, for I know nothing whatever to her prejudice. But\nin making her request to me, she stated that the object of the desired\ninterview was to speak to you privately on the subject of your sister.\nForgive me for acknowledging that I determined to withhold the address\nas soon as I heard this. You will make allowances for your old friend,\nand your sincere well-wisher? You will not take it amiss if I express my\nstrong disapproval of your allowing yourself, on any pretense whatever,\nto be mixed up for the future with your sister's proceedings.\n\n\"I will not distress you by saying more than this. But I feel too\ndeep an interest in your welfare, and too sincere an admiration of the\npatience with which you have borne all your trials, to say less.\n\n\"If I cannot prevail on you to follow my advice, you have only to say\nso, and Mrs. Lecount shall have your address to-morrow. In this case\n(which I cannot contemplate without the greatest unwillingness), let me\nat least recommend you to stipulate that Miss Garth shall be present at\nthe interview. In any matter with which your sister is concerned, you\nmay want an old friend's advice, and an old friend's protection against\nyour own generous impulses. If I could have helped you in this way,\nI would; but Mrs. Lecount gave me indirectly to understand that the\nsubject to be discussed was of too delicate a nature to permit of my\npresence. Whatever this objection may be really worth, it cannot apply\nto Miss Garth, who has brought you both up from childhood. I say, again,\ntherefore, if you see Mrs. Lecount, see her in Miss Garth's company.\n\n\"Always most truly yours,\n\n\"WILLIAM PENDRIL.\"\n\n\nVIII.\n\n_From Norah Vanstone to Mr. Pendril._\n\n\"Portland Place, Wednesday.\n\n\"DEAR MR. PENDRIL--Pray don't think I am ungrateful for your kindness.\nIndeed, indeed I am not! But I must see Mrs. Lecount. You were not aware\nwhen you wrote to me that I had received a few lines from Magdalen--not\ntelling me where she is, but holding out the hope of our meeting before\nlong. Perhaps Mrs. Lecount may have something to say to me on this very\nsubject. Even if it should not be so, my sister--do what she may--is\nstill my sister. I can't desert her; I can't turn my back on any one who\ncomes to me in her name. You know, dear Mr. Pendril, I have always been\nobstinate on this subject, and you have always borne with me. Let me\nowe another obligation to you which I can never return, and bear with me\nstill!\n\n\"Need I say that I willingly accept that part of your advice which\nrefers to Miss Garth? I have already written to beg that she will come\nhere at four to-morrow afternoon.

He had only time, during Mr. Loscombe's\nmomentary absence, to satisfy his curiosity by looking at the beginning\nof the document and at the end. At the beginning he saw the customary\nform used in making a will; at the end he discovered the signature of\nMr. Noel Vanstone, with the names of two attesting witnesses, and the\ndate (of which he is quite certain)--_the thirtieth of September last._\n\n\"Before the clerk had time to make any further investigations, his\nmaster returned, sorted the papers on the table, and carefully locked up\nthe will in the strong box devoted to the custody of Mr. Noel Vanstone's\ndocuments. It has been ascertained that, at the close of September,\nMr. Loscombe was absent from the office. If he was then employed in\nsuperintending the execution of his client's will--which is quite\npossible--it follows clearly that he was in the secret of Mr. Vanstone's\naddress after the removal of the 4th of September; and if you can do\nnothing on your side, it may be desirable to have the lawyer watched on\nours. In any case, it is certainly ascertained that Mr. Noel Vanstone\nhas made his will since his marriage. I leave you to draw your own\nconclusions from that fact, and remain, in the hope of hearing from you\nshortly,\n\n\"Your faithful servant,\n\n\"ALFRED DE BLERIOT.\"\n\n\nX.\n\n_From Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril._\n\n\"Portland Place, October 28th.\n\n\"MY DEAR SIR--Mrs. Lecount has just left us. If it was not too late to\nwish, I should wish, from the bottom of my heart, that Norah had taken\nyour advice, and had refused to see her.\n\n\"I write in such distress of mind that I cannot hope to give you a clear\nand complete account of the interview. I can only tell you briefly what\nMrs. Lecount has done, and what our situation now is. The rest must be\nleft until I am more composed, and until I can speak to you personally.\n\n\"You will remember my informing you of the letter which Mrs. Lecount\naddressed to Norah from Aldborough, and which I answered for her in her\nabsence. When Mrs. Lecount made her appearance to-day, her first words\nannounced to us that she had come to renew the subject. As well as I can\nremember it, this is what she said, addressing herself to Norah:\n\n\"'I wrote to you on the subject of your sister, Miss Vanstone, some\nlittle time since, and Miss Garth was so good as to answer the letter.\nWhat I feared at that time has come true. Your sister has defied all my\nefforts to check her; she has disappeared in company with my master, Mr.\nNoel Vanstone; and she is now in a position of danger which may lead to\nher disgrace and ruin at a moment's notice. It is my interest to recover\nmy master, it is your interest to save your sister. Tell me--for time is\nprecious--have you any news of her?'\n\n\"Norah answered, as well as her terror and distress would allow her, 'I\nhave had a letter, but there was no address on it.'\n\n\"Mrs. Lecount asked, 'Was there no postmark on the envelope?'\n\n\"Norah said, 'Yes; Allonby.'\n\n\"'Allonby is better than nothing,' said Mrs. Lecount. 'Allonby may help\nyou to trace her. Where is Allonby?'\n\n\"Norah told her. It all passed in a minute. I had been too much confused\nand startled to interfere before, but I composed myself sufficiently to\ninterfere now.\n\n\"'You have entered into no particulars,' I said. 'You have only\nfrightened us--you have told us nothing.'\n\n\"'You shall hear the particulars, ma'am,' said Mrs. Lecount; 'and you\nand Miss Vanstone shall judge for yourselves if I have frightened you\nwithout a cause.'\n\n\"Upon this, she entered at once upon a long narrative, which I cannot--I\nmight almost say, which I dare not--repeat. You will understand the\nhorror we both felt when I tell you the end. If Mrs. Lecount's\nstatement is to be relied on, Magdalen has carried her mad resolution\nof recovering her father's fortune to the last and most desperate\nextremity--she has married Michael Vanstone's son under a false name.\nHer husband is at this moment still persuaded that her maiden name was\nBygrave, and that she is really the niece of a scoundrel who assisted\nher imposture, and whom I recognize, by the description of him, to have\nbeen Captain Wragge.\n\n\"I spare you Mrs. Lecount's cool avowal, when she rose to leave us,\nof her own mercenary motives in wishing to discover her master and to\nenlighten him. I spare you the hints she dropped of Magdalen's purpose\nin contracting this infamous marriage. The one aim and object of my\nletter is to implore you to assist me in quieting Norah's anguish of\nmind. The shock she has received at hearing this news of her sister is\nnot the worst result of what has happened. She has persuaded herself\nthat the answers she innocently gave, in her distress, to Mrs. Lecount's\nquestions on the subject of her letter--the answers wrung from her under\nthe sudden pressure of confusion and alarm--may be used to Magdalen's\nprejudice by the woman who purposely startled her into giving the\ninformation. I can only prevent her from taking some desperate step\non her side--some step by which she may forfeit the friendship and\nprotection of the excellent people with whom she is now living--by\nreminding her that if Mrs. Lecount traces her master by means of the\npostmark on the letter, we may trace Magdalen at the same time, and by\nthe same means. Whatever objection you may personally feel to renewing\nthe efforts for the rescue of this miserable girl which failed so\nlamentably at York, I entreat you, for Norah's sake, to take the same\nsteps now which we took then. Send me the only assurance which will\nquiet her--the assurance, under your own hand, that the search on our\nside has begun. If you will do this, you may trust me, when the time\ncomes, to stand between these two sisters, and to defend Norah's peace,\ncharacter, and future prosperity at any price.\n\n\"Most sincerely yours,\n\n\"HARRIET GARTH.\"\n\n\nXI.\n\n_From Mrs. Lecount to Mr. de Bleriot._\n\n\"October 28th.\n\n\"DEAR SIR--I have found the trace you wanted.

My luggage is packed, and I start for the North by the next\ntrain.\n\n\"Your deeply obliged\n\n\"VIRGINIE LECOUNT.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FIFTH SCENE\n\nBALIOL COTTAGE, DUMFRIES.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTOWARD eleven o'clock, on the morning of the third of November, the\nbreakfast-table at Baliol Cottage presented that essentially comfortless\nappearance which is caused by a meal in a state of transition--that is\nto say, by a meal prepared for two persons, which has been already eaten\nby one, and which has not yet been approached by the other. It must be a\nhardy appetite which can contemplate without a momentary discouragement\nthe battered egg-shell, the fish half stripped to a skeleton, the\ncrumbs in the plate, and the dregs in the cup. There is surely a wise\nsubmission to those weaknesses in human nature which must be respected\nand not reproved, in the sympathizing rapidity with which servants in\nplaces of public refreshment clear away all signs of the customer in\nthe past, from the eyes of the customer in the present. Although his\npredecessor may have been the wife of his bosom or the child of his\nloins, no man can find himself confronted at table by the traces of a\nvanished eater, without a passing sense of injury in connection with the\nidea of his own meal.\n\nSome such impression as this found its way into the mind of Mr. Noel\nVanstone when he entered the lonely breakfast-parlor at Baliol Cottage\nshortly after eleven o'clock. He looked at the table with a frown, and\nrang the bell with an expression of disgust.\n\n\"Clear away this mess,\" he said, when the servant appeared. \"Has your\nmistress gone?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--nearly an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Is Louisa downstairs?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"When you have put the table right, send Louisa up to me.\"\n\nHe walked away to the window. The momentary irritation passed away from\nhis face; but it left an expression there which remained--an expression\nof pining discontent. Personally, his marriage had altered him for the\nworse. His wizen little cheeks were beginning to shrink into hollows,\nhis frail little figure had already contracted a slight stoop. The\nformer delicacy of his complexion had gone--the sickly paleness of\nit was all that remained. His thin flaxen mustaches were no longer\npragmatically waxed and twisted into a curl: their weak feathery ends\nhung meekly pendent over the querulous corners of his mouth. If the ten\nor twelve weeks since his marriage had been counted by his locks, they\nmight have reckoned as ten or twelve years. He stood at the window\nmechanically picking leaves from a pot of heath placed in front of it,\nand drearily humming the forlorn fragment of a tune.\n\nThe prospect from the window overlooked the course of the Nith at a bend\nof the river a few miles above Dumfries. Here and there, through wintry\ngaps in the wooded bank, broad tracts of the level cultivated valley\nmet the eye. Boats passed on the river, and carts plodded along the\nhigh-road on their way to Dumfries. The sky was clear; the November sun\nshone as pleasantly as if the year had been younger by two good months;\nand the view, noted in Scotland for its bright and peaceful charm, was\npresented at the best which its wintry aspect could assume. If it had\nbeen hidden in mist or drenched with rain, Mr. Noel Vanstone would,\nto all appearance, have found it as attractive as he found it now. He\nwaited at the window until he heard Louisa's knock at the door, then\nturned back sullenly to the breakfast-table and told her to come in.\n\n\"Make the tea,\" he said. \"I know nothing about it. I'm left here\nneglected. Nobody helps me.\"\n\nThe discreet Louisa silently and submissively obeyed.\n\n\"Did your mistress leave any message for me,\" he asked, \"before she went\naway?\"\n\n\"No message in particular, sir. My mistress only said she should be too\nlate if she waited breakfast any longer.\"\n\n\"Did she say nothing else?\"\n\n\"She told me at the carriage door, sir, that she would most likely be\nback in a week.\"\n\n\"Was she in good spirits at the carriage door?\"\n\n\"No, sir. I thought my mistress seemed very anxious and uneasy. Is there\nanything more I can do, sir?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Wait a minute.\"\n\nHe proceeded discontentedly with his breakfast. Louisa waited resignedly\nat the door.\n\n\"I think your mistress has been in bad spirits lately,\" he resumed, with\na sudden outbreak of petulance.\n\n\"My mistress has not been very cheerful, sir.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by not very cheerful? Do you mean to prevaricate? Am\nI nobody in the house? Am I to be kept in the dark about everything? Is\nyour mistress to go away on her own affairs, and leave me at home like\na child--and am I not even to ask a question about her? Am I to be\nprevaricated with by a servant? I won't be prevaricated with! Not very\ncheerful? What do you mean by not very cheerful?\"\n\n\"I only meant that my mistress was not in good spirits, sir.\"\n\n\"Why couldn't you say it, then? Don't you know the value of words? The\nmost dreadful consequences sometimes happen from not knowing the value\nof words. Did your mistress tell you she was going to London?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What did you think when your mistress told you she was going to London?\nDid you think it odd she was going without me?\"\n\n\"I did not presume to think it odd, sir.--Is there anything more I can\ndo for you, if you please, sir?\"\n\n\"What sort of a morning is it out? Is it warm? Is the sun on the\ngarden?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Have you seen the sun yourself on the garden?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Get me my great-coat; I'll take a little turn. Has the man brushed it?\nDid you see the man brush it yourself? What do you mean by saying he\nhas brushed it, when you didn't see him? Let me look at the tails. If\nthere's a speck of dust on the tails, I'll turn the man off!--Help me on\nwith it.\"\n\nLouisa helped him on with his coat, and gave him his hat. He went out\nirritably. The coat was a large one (it had belonged to his father); the\nhat was a large one (it was a misfit purchased as a bargain by himself).\nHe was submerged in his hat and coat; he looked singularly small,\nand frail, and miserable, as he slowly wended his way, in the wintry\nsunlight, down the garden walk. The path sloped gently from the back of\nthe house to the water side, from which it was parted by a low wooden\nfence. After pacing backward and forward slowly for some little time,\nhe stopped at the lower extremity of the garden, and, leaning on the fen\nce, looked down listlessly at the smooth flow of the river.\n\nHis thoughts still ran on the subject of his first fretful question to\nLouisa--he was still brooding over the circumstances under which\nhis wife had left the cottage that morning, and over the want of\nconsideration toward himself implied in the manner of her departure. The\nlonger he thought of his grievance, the more acutely he resented it. He\nwas capable of great tenderness of feeling where any injury to his sense\nof his own importance was concerned. His head drooped little by little\non his arms, as they rested on the fence, and, in the deep sincerity of\nhis mortification, he sighed bitterly.\n\nThe sigh was answered by a voice close at his side.\n\n\"You were happier with _me_, sir,\" said the voice, in accents of tender\nregret.\n\nHe looked up with a scream--literally, with a scream--and confronted\nMrs. Lecount.\n\nWas it the specter of the woman, or the woman herself? Her hair was\nwhite; her face had fallen away; her eyes looked out large, bright, and\nhaggard over her hollow cheeks. She was withered and old. Her dress hung\nloose round her wasted figure; not a trace of its buxom autumnal beauty\nremained. The quietly impenetrable resolution, the smoothly insinuating\nvoice--these were the only relics of the past which sickness and\nsuffering had left in Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Compose yourself, Mr. Noel,\" she said, gently. \"You have no cause to\nbe alarmed at seeing me. Your servant, when I inquired, said you were\nin the garden, and I came here to find you. I have traced you out, sir,\nwith no resentment against yourself, with no wish to distress you by so\nmuch as the shadow of a reproach. I come here on what has been, and is\nstill, the business of my life--your service.\"\n\nHe recovered himself a little, but he was still incapable of speech. He\nheld fast by the fence, and stared at her.\n\n\"Try to possess your mind, sir, of what I say,\" proceeded Mrs. Lecount.\n\"I have come here not as your enemy, but as your friend. I have been\ntried by sickness, I have been tried by distress. Nothing remains of me\nbut my heart. My heart forgives you; my heart, in your sore need--need\nwhich you have yet to feel-places me at your service. Take my arm, Mr.\nNoel. A little turn in the sun will help you to recover yourself.\"\n\nShe put his hand through her arm and marched him slowly up the garden\nwalk. Before she had been five minutes in his company, she had resumed\nfull possession of him in her own right.\n\n\"Now down again, Mr. Noel,\" she said. \"Gently down again, in this fine\nsunlight. I have much to say to you, sir, which you never expected to\nhear from me. Let me ask a little domestic question first. They told me\nat the house door Mrs. Noel Vanstone was gone away on a journey. Has she\ngone for long?\"\n\nHer master's hand trembled on her arm as she put that question. Instead\nof answering it, he tried faintly to plead for himself. The first words\nthat escaped him were prompted by his first returning sense--the sense\nthat his housekeeper had taken him into custody. He tried to make his\npeace with Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"I always meant to do something for you,\" he said, coaxingly. \"You would\nhave heard from me before long. Upon my word and honor, Lecount, you\nwould have heard from me before long!\"\n\n\"I don't doubt it, sir,\" replied Mrs. Lecount. \"But for the present,\nnever mind about Me. You and your interests first.\"\n\n\"How did you come here?\" he asked, looking at her in astonishment. \"How\ncame you to find me out?\"\n\n\"It is a long story, sir; I will tell it you some other time. Let it be\nenough to say now that I _have_ found you. Will Mrs. Noel be back again\nat the house to-day? A little louder, sir; I can hardly hear you. So!\nso! Not back again for a week! And where has she gone? To London, did\nyou say? And what for?--I am not inquisitive, Mr. Noel; I am asking\nserious questions, under serious necessity. Why has your wife left you\nhere, and gone to London by herself?\"\n\nThey were down at the fence again as she made that last inquiry, and\nthey waited, leaning against it, while Noel Vanstone answered. Her\nreiterated assurances that she bore him no malice were producing their\neffect; he was beginning to recover himself. The old helpless habit of\naddressing all his complaints to his housekeeper was returning already\nwith the re-appearance of Mrs. Lecount--returning insidiously, in\ncompany with that besetting anxiety to talk about his grievances, which\nhad got the better of him at the breakfast-table, and which had shown\nthe wound inflicted on his vanity to his wife's maid.\n\n\"I can't answer for Mrs. Noel Vanstone,\" he said, spitefully. \"Mrs. Noel\nVanstone has not treated me with the consideration which is my due. She\nhas taken my permission for granted, and she has only thought proper to\ntell me that the object of her journey is to see her friends in London.\nShe went away this morning without bidding me good-by. She takes her own\nway as if I was nobody; she treats me like a child. You may not believe\nit, Lecount, but I don't even know who her friends are. I am left quite\nin the dark; I am left to guess for myself that her friends in London\nare her uncle and aunt.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount privately considered the question by the help of her own\nknowledge obtained in London. She soon reached the obvious conclusion.\nAfter writing to her sister in the first instance, Magdalen had now, in\nall probability, followed the letter in person. There was little doubt\nthat the friends she had gone to visit in London were her sister and\nMiss Garth.\n\n\"Not her uncle and aunt, sir,\" resumed Mrs. Lecount, composedly. \"A\nsecret for your private ear! She has no uncle and aunt. Another little\nturn before I explain myself--another little turn to compose your\nspirits.\"\n\nShe took him into custody once more, and marched him back toward the\nhouse.\n\n\"Mr. Noel!\" she said, suddenly stopping in the middle of the walk. \"Do\nyou know what was the worst mischief you ever did yourself in your life?\nI will tell you. That worst mischief was sending me to Zurich.\"\n\nHis hand began to tremble on her arm once more.\n\n\"I didn't do it!\" he cried piteously. \"It was all Mr. Bygrave.\"\n\n\"You acknowledge, sir, that Mr. Bygrave deceived _me?_\" proceeded Mrs.\nLecount. \"I am glad to hear that. You will be all the readier to make\nthe next discovery which is waiting for you--the discovery that Mr.\nBygrave has deceived _you_. He is not here to slip through my fingers\nnow, and I am not the helpless woman in this place that I was at\nAldborough. Thank God!\"\n\nShe uttered that devout exclamation through her set teeth. All her\nhatred of Captain Wragge hissed out of her lips in those two words.\n\n\"Oblige me, sir, by holding one side of my traveling-bag,\" she resumed,\n\"while I open it and take something out.\"\n\nThe interior of the bag disclosed a series of neatly-folded papers, all\nlaid together in order, and numbered outside. Mrs. Lecount took out one\nof the papers, and shut up the bag again with a loud snap of the spring\nthat closed it.\n\n\"At Aldborough, Mr. Noel, I had only my own opinion to support me,\" she\nremarked. \"My own opinion was nothing against Miss Bygrave's youth and\nbeauty, and Mr. Bygrave's ready wit. I could only hope to attack your\ninfatuation with proofs, and at that time I had not got them. I have got\nthem now! I am armed at all points with proofs; I bristle from head to\nfoot with proofs; I break my forced silence, and speak with the emphasis\nof my proofs. Do you know this writing, sir?\"\n\nHe shrank back from the paper which she offered to him.\n\n\"I don't understand this,\" he said, nervously. \"I don't know what you\nwant, or what you mean.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount forced the paper into his hand. \"You shall know what I\nmean, sir, if you will give me a moment's attention,\" she said. \"On\nthe day after you went away to St. Crux, I obtained admission to Mr.\nBygrave's house, and I had some talk in private with Mr. Bygrave's wife.\nThat talk supplied me with the means to convince you which I had wanted\nto find for weeks and weeks past. I wrote you a letter to say so--I\nwrote to tell you that I would forfeit my place in your service, and my\nexpectations from your generosity, if I did not prove to you when I came\nback from Switzerland that my own private suspicion of Miss Bygrave was\nthe truth. I directed that letter to you at St. Crux, and I posted\nit myself. Now, Mr. Noel, read the paper which I have forced into your\nhand. It is Admiral Bartram's written affirmation that my letter came to\nSt. Crux, and that he inclosed it to you, under cover to Mr. Bygrave,\nat your own request. Did Mr. Bygrave ever give you that letter? Don't\nagitate yourself, sir! One word of reply will do--Yes or No.\"\n\nHe read the paper, and looked up at her with growing bewilderment and\nfear. She obstinately waited until he spoke. \"No,\" he said, faintly; \"I\nnever got the letter.\"\n\n\"First proof!\" said Mrs. Lecount, taking the paper from him, and putting\nit back in the bag. \"One more, with your kind permission, before we come\nto things more serious still. I gave you a written description, sir, at\nAldborough, of a person not named, and I asked you to compare it with\nMiss Bygrave the next time you were in her company. After having first\nshown the description to Mr. Bygrave--it is useless to deny it now,\nMr. Noel; your friend at North Shingles is not here to help you!--after\nhaving first shown my note to Mr. Bygrave, you made the comparison,\nand you found it fail in the most important particular. There were two\nlittle moles placed close together on the left side of the neck, in my\ndescription of the unknown lady, and there were no little moles at\nall when you looked at Miss Bygrave's neck. I am old enough to be your\nmother, Mr. Noel. If the question is not indelicate, may I ask what the\npresent state of your knowledge is on the subject of your wife's neck?\"\n\nShe looked at him with a merciless steadiness. He drew back a few steps,\ncowering under her eye. \"I can't say,\" he stammered. \"I don't know.\nWhat do you mean by these questions? I never thought about the moles\nafterward; I never looked. She wears her hair low--\"\n\n\"She has excellent reasons to wear it low, sir,\" remarked Mrs. Lecount.\n\"We will try and lift that hair before we have done with the subject.\nWhen I came out here to find you in the garden, I saw a neat young\nperson through the kitchen window, with her work in her hand, who looked\nto my eyes like a lady's maid. Is this young person your wife's maid? I\nbeg your pardon, sir, did you say yes? In that case, another question,\nif you please. Did you engage her, or did your wife?\"\n\n\"I engaged her--\"\n\n\"While I was away? While I was in total ignorance that you meant to have\na wife, or a wife's maid?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Under those circumstances, Mr. Noel, you cannot possibly suspect me of\nconspiring to deceive you, with the maid for my instrument. Go into\nthe house, sir, while I wait here. Ask the woman who dresses Mrs. Noel\nVanstone's hair morning and night whether her mistress has a mark on the\nleft side of her neck, and (if so) what that mark is?\"\n\nHe walked a few steps toward the house without uttering a word, then\nstopped, and looked back at Mrs. Lecount. His blinking eyes were steady,\nand his wizen face had become suddenly composed. Mrs. Lecount advanced a\nlittle and joined him. She saw the change; but, with all her experience\nof him, she failed to interpret the true meaning of it.\n\n\"Are you in want of a pretense, sir?\" she asked. \"Are you at a loss to\naccount to your wife's maid for such a question as I wish you to put to\nher? Pretenses are easily found which will do for persons in her station\nof life. Say I have come here with news of a legacy for Mrs. Noel\nVanstone, and that there is a question of her identity to settle before\nshe can receive the money.\"\n\nShe pointed to the house. He paid no attention to the sign. His face\ngrew paler and paler. Without moving or speaking he stood and looked at\nher.\n\n\"Are you afraid?\" asked Mrs. Lecount.\n\nThose words roused him; those words lit a spark of the fire of manhood\nin him at last. He turned on her like a sheep on a dog.\n\n\"I won't be questioned and ordered!\" he broke out, trembling violently\nunder the new sensation of his own courage. \"I won't be threatened and\nmystified any longer! How did you find me out at this place? What do you\nmean by coming here with your hints and your mysteries? What have you\ngot to say against my wife?\"\n\nMrs. Lecount composedly opened the traveling-bag and took out her\nsmelling bottle, in case of emergency.\n\n\"You have spoken to me in plain words,\" she said. \"In plain words, sir,\nyou shall have your answer. Are you too angry to listen?\"\n\nHer looks and tones alarmed him, in spite of himself. His courage began\nto sink again; and, desperately as he tried to steady it, his voice\ntrembled when he answered her.\n\n\"Give me my answer,\" he said, \"and give it at once.\"\n\n\"Your commands shall be obeyed, sir, to the letter,\" replied Mrs.\nLecount. \"I have come here with two objects. To open your eyes to\nyour own situation, and to save your fortune--perhaps your life. Your\nsituation is this. Miss Bygrave has married you under a false character\nand a false name. Can you rouse your memory? Can you call to mind the\ndisguised woman who threatened you in Vauxhall Walk? That woman--as\ncertainly as I stand here--is now your wife.\"\n\nHe looked at her in breathless silence, his lips falling apart, his\neyes fixed in vacant inquiry. The suddenness of the disclosure had\noverreached its own end. It had stupefied him.\n\n\"My wife?\" he repeated, and burst into an imbecile laugh.\n\n\"Your wife,\" reiterated Mrs. Lecount.\n\nAt the repetition of those two words the strain on his faculties\nrelaxed. A thought dawned on him for the first time. His eyes fixed on\nher with a furtive alarm, and he drew back hastily. \"Mad!\" he said to\nhimself, with a sudden remembrance of what his friend Mr. Bygrave had\ntold him at Aldborough, sharpened by his own sense of the haggard change\nthat he saw in her face.\n\nHe spoke in a whisper, but Mrs. Lecount heard him. She was close at his\nside again in an instant. For the first time, her self-possession failed\nher, and she caught him angrily by the arm.\n\n\"Will you put my madness to the proof, sir?\" she asked.\n\nHe shook off her hold; he began to gather courage again, in the intense\nsincerity of his disbelief, courage to face the assertion which she\npersisted in forcing on him.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"What must I do?\"\n\n\"Do what I told you,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"Ask the maid that question\nabout her mistress on the spot. And if she tells you the mark is there,\ndo one thing more. Take me up into your wife's room, and open her\nwardrobe in my presence with your own hands.\"\n\n\"What do you want with her wardrobe?\" he asked.\n\n\"You shall know when you open it.\"\n\n\"Very strange!\" he said to himself, vacantly. \"It's like a scene in a\nnovel--it's like nothing in real life.\" He went slowly into the house,\nand Mrs. Lecount waited for him in the garden.\n\nAfter an absence of a few minutes only he appeared again, on the top of\nthe flight of steps which led into the garden from the house. He held\nby the iron rail with one hand, while with the other he beckoned to Mrs.\nLecount to join him on the steps.\n\n\"What does the maid say?\" she asked, as she approached him. \"Is the mark\nthere?\"\n\nHe answered in a whisper, \"Yes.\" What he had heard from the maid had\nproduced a marked change in him. The horror of the coming discovery had\nlaid its paralyzing hold on his mind. He moved mechanically; he looked\nand spoke like a man in a dream.\n\n\"Will you take my arm, sir?\"\n\nHe shook his head, and, preceding her along the passage and up the\nstairs, led the way into his wife's room. When she joined him and locked\nthe door, he stood passively waiting for his directions, without making\nany remark, without showing any external appearance of surprise. He had\nnot removed either his hat or coat. Mrs. Lecount took them off for him.\n\"Thank you,\" he said, with the docility of a well-trained child. \"It's\nlike a scene in a novel--it's like nothing in real life.\"\n\nThe bed-chamber was not very large, and the furniture was heavy and\nold-fashioned. But evidences of Magdalen's natural taste and refinement\nwere visible everywhere, in the little embellishments that graced and\nenlivened the aspect of the room. The perfume of dried rose-leaves\nhung fra grant on the cool air. Mrs. Lecount sniffed the perfume with a\ndisparaging frown and threw the window up to its full height. \"Pah!\" she\nsaid, with a shudder of virtuous disgust, \"the atmosphere of deceit!\"\n\nShe seated herself near the window. The wardrobe stood against the wall\nopposite, and the bed was at the side of the room on her right hand.\n\"Open the wardrobe, Mr. Noel,\" she said. \"I don't go near it. I touch\nnothing in it myself. Take out the dresses with your own hand and put\nthem on the bed. Take them out one by one until I tell you to stop.\"\n\nHe obeyed her. \"I'll do it as well as I can,\" he said. \"My hands are\ncold, and my head feels half asleep.\"\n\nThe dresses to be removed were not many, for Magdalen had taken some\nof them away with her. After he had put two dresses on the bed, he was\nobliged to search in the inner recesses of the wardrobe before he could\nfind a third. When he produced it, Mrs. Lecount made a sign to him to\nstop. The end was reached already; he had found the brown Alpaca dress.\n\n\"Lay it out on the bed, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"You will see a double\nflounce running round the bottom of it. Lift up the outer flounce, and\npass the inner one through your fingers, inch by inch. If you come to a\nplace where there is a morsel of the stuff missing, stop and look up at\nme.\"\n\nHe passed the flounce slowly through his fingers for a minute or more,\nthen stopped and looked up. Mrs. Lecount produced her pocket-book and\nopened it.\n\n\"Every word I now speak, sir, is of serious consequence to you and\nto me,\" she said. \"Listen with your closest attention. When the woman\ncalling herself Miss Garth came to see us in Vauxhall Walk, I knelt down\nbehind the chair in which she was sitting and I cut a morsel of stuff\nfrom the dress she wore, which might help me to know that dress if I\never saw it again. I did this while the woman's whole attention was\nabsorbed in talking to you. The morsel of stuff has been kept in my\npocketbook from that time to this. See for yourself, Mr. Noel, if it\nfits the gap in that dress which your own hands have just taken from\nyour wife's wardrobe.\"\n\nShe rose and handed him the fragment of stuff across the bed. He put it\ninto the vacant space in the flounce as well as his trembling fingers\nwould let him.\n\n\"Does it fit, sir?\" asked Mrs. Lecount.\n\nThe dress dropped from his hands, and the deadly bluish pallor--which\nevery doctor who attended him had warned his housekeeper to\ndread--overspread his face slowly. Mrs. Lecount had not reckoned on\nsuch an answer to her question as she now saw in his cheeks. She hurried\nround to him, with the smelling-bottle in her hand. He dropped to his\nknees and caught at her dress with the grasp of a drowning man. \"Save\nme!\" he gasped, in a hoarse, breathless whisper. \"Oh, Lecount, save me!\"\n\n\"I promise to save you,\" said Mrs. Lecount; \"I am here with the means\nand the resolution to save you. Come away from this place--come nearer\nto the air.\" She raised him as she spoke, and led him across the room\nto the window. \"Do you feel the chill pain again on your left side?\" she\nasked, with the first signs of alarm that she had shown yet. \"Has your\nwife got any eau-de-cologne, any sal-volatile in her room? Don't exhaust\nyourself by speaking--point to the place!\"\n\nHe pointed to a little triangular cupboard of old worm-eaten walnut-wood\nfixed high in a corner of the room. Mrs. Lecount tried the door: it was\nlocked.\n\nAs she made that discovery, she saw his head sink back gradually on the\neasy-chair in which she had placed him. The warning of the doctors in\npast years--\"If you ever let him faint, you let him die\"--recurred to\nher memory as if it had been spoken the day before. She looked at the\ncupboard again. In a recess under it lay some ends of cord, placed there\napparently for purposes of packing. Without an instant's hesitation, she\nsnatched up a morsel of cord, tied one end fast round the knob of\nthe cupboard door, and seizing the other end in both hands, pulled it\nsuddenly with the exertion of her whole strength. The rotten wood gave\nway, the cupboard doors flew open, and a heap of little trifles poured\nout noisily on the floor. Without stopping to notice the broken china\nand glass at her feet, she looked into the dark recesses of the cupboard\nand saw the gleam of two glass bottles. One was put away at the extreme\nback of the shelf, the other was a little in advance, almost hiding it.\nShe snatched them both out at once, and took them, one in each hand, to\nthe window, where she could read their labels in the clearer light.\n\nThe bottle in her right hand was the first bottle she looked at. It was\nmarked--_Sal-volatile_.\n\nShe instantly laid the other bottle aside on the table without looking\nat it. The other bottle lay there, waiting its turn. It held a dark\nliquid, and it was labeled--POISON.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nMRS. LECOUNT mixed the sal-volatile with water, and administered\nit immediately. The stimulant had its effect. In a few minutes Noel\nVanstone was able to raise himself in the chair without assistance; his\ncolor changed again for the better, and his breath came and went more\nfreely.\n\n\"How do you feel now, sir?\" asked Mrs. Lecount. \"Are you warm again on\nyour left side?\"\n\nHe paid no attention to that inquiry; his eyes, wandering about the\nroom, turned by chance toward the table. To Mrs. Lecount's surprise,\ninstead of answering her, he bent forward in his chair, and looked with\nstaring eyes and pointing hand at the second bottle which she had taken\nfrom the cupboard, and which she had hastily laid aside without paying\nattention to it. Seeing that some new alarm possessed him, she advanced\nto the table, and looked where he looked. The labeled side of the bottle\nwas full in view; and there, in the plain handwriting of the chemist at\nAldborough, was the one startling word confronting them both--\"Poison.\"\n\nEven Mrs. Lecount's self-possession was shaken by that discovery. She\nwas not prepared to see her own darkest forebodings--the unacknowledged\noffspring of her hatred for Magdalen--realized as she saw them realized\nnow. The suicide-despair in which the poison had been procured; the\nsuicide-purpose for which, in distrust of the future, the poison had\nbeen kept, had brought with them their own retribution. There the bottle\nlay, in Magdalen's absence, a false witness of treason which had never\nentered her mind--treason against her husband's life!\n\nWith his hand still mechanically pointing at the table Noel Vanstone\nraised his head and looked up at Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"I took it from the cupboard,\" she said, answering the look. \"I took\nboth bottles out together, not knowing which might be the bottle I\nwanted. I am as much shocked, as much frightened, as you are.\"\n\n\"Poison!\" he said to himself, slowly. \"Poison locked up by my wife in\nthe cupboard in her own room.\" He stopped, and looked at Mrs. Lecount\nonce more. \"For _me?_\" he asked, in a vacant, inquiring tone.\n\n\"We will not talk of it, sir, until your mind is more at ease,\" said\nMrs. Lecount. \"In the meantime, the danger that lies waiting in this\nbottle shall be instantly destroyed in your presence.\" She took out the\ncork, and threw the laudanum out of window, and the empty bottle after\nit. \"Let us try to forget this dreadful discovery for the present,\" she\nresumed; \"let us go downstairs at once. All that I have now to say to\nyou can be said in another room.\"\n\nShe helped him to rise from the chair, and took his arm in her own.\n\"It is well for him; it is well for me,\" she thought, as they went\ndownstairs together, \"that I came when I did.\"\n\nOn crossing the passage, she stepped to the front door, where the\ncarriage was waiting which had brought her from Dumfries, and instructed\nthe coachman to put up his horses at the nearest inn, and to call again\nfor her in two hours' time. This done, she accompanied Noel Vanstone\ninto the sitting-room, stirred up the fire, and placed him before it\ncomfortably in an easy-chair. He sat for a few minutes, warming his\nhands feebly like an old man, and staring straight into the flame. Then\nhe spoke.\n\n\"When the woman came and threatened me in Vauxhall Walk,\" he began,\nstill staring into the fire, \"you came back to the parlor after she was\ngone, and you told me--?\" He stopped, shivered a little, and lost the\nthread of his recollections at that point.\n\n\"I told you, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, \"that the woman was, in my\nopinion, Miss Vanstone herself. Don't start, Mr. Noel! Your wife is\naway, and I am here to take care of you. Say to yourself, if you feel\nfrightened, 'Lecount is here; Lecount will take care of me.' The truth\nmust be told, sir, however hard to bear the truth may be. Miss Magdalen\nVanstone was the woman who came to you in disguise; and the woman who\ncame to you in disguise is the woman you have married. The conspiracy\nwhich she threatened you with in London is the conspiracy which has\nmade her your wife. That is the plain truth. You have seen the dress\nupstairs. If that dress had been no longer in existence, I should still\nhave had my proofs to convince you. Thanks to my interview with Mrs.\nBygrave I have discovered the house your wife lodged at in London; it\nwas opposite our house in Vauxhall Walk. I have laid my hand on one of\nthe landlady's daughters, who watched your wife from an inner room, and\nsaw her put on the disguise; who can speak to her identity, and to the\nidentity of her companion, Mrs. Bygrave; and who has furnished me, at\nmy own request, with a written statement of facts, which she is ready to\naffirm on oath if any person ventures to contradict her. You shall read\nthe statement, Mr. Noel, if you like, when you are fitter to understand\nit. You shall also read a letter in the handwriting of Miss Garth--who\nwill repeat to you personally every word she has written to me--a\nletter formally denying that she was ever in Vauxhall Walk, and formally\nasserting that those moles on your wife's neck are marks peculiar to\nMiss Magdalen Vanstone, whom she has known from childhood. I say it with\na just pride--you will find no weak place anywhere in the evidence which\nI bring you. If Mr. Bygrave had not stolen my letter, you would have had\nyour warning before I was cruelly deceived into going to Zurich; and the\nproofs which I now bring you, after your marriage, I should then have\noffered to you before it. Don't hold me responsible, sir, for what has\nhappened since I left England. Blame your uncle's bastard daughter, and\nblame that villain with the brown eye and the green!\"\n\nShe spoke her last venomous words as slowly and distinctly as she had\nspoken all the rest. Noel Vanstone made no answer--he still sat cowering\nover the fire. She looked round into his face. He was crying silently.\n\"I was so fond of her!\" said the miserable little creature; \"and I\nthought she was so fond of Me!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount turned her back on him in disdainful silence. \"Fond of\nher!\" As she repeated those words to herself, her haggard face became\nalmost handsome again in the magnificent intensity of its contempt.\n\nShe walked to a book-case at the lower end of the room, and began\nexamining the volumes in it. Before she had been long engaged in this\nway, she was startled by the sound of his voice, affrightedly calling\nher back. The tears were gone from his face; it was blank again with\nterror when he now turned it toward her.\n\n\"Lecount!\" he said, holding to her with both hands. \"Can an egg be\npoisoned? I had an egg for breakfast this morning, and a little toast.\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"The poison of your\nwife's deceit is the only poison you have taken yet. If she had resolved\nalready on making you pay the price of your folly with your life, she\nwould not be absent from the house while you were left living in it.\nDismiss the thought from your mind. It is the middle of the day; you\nwant refreshment. I have more to say to you in the interests of your\nown safety--I have something for you to do, which must be done at once.\nRecruit your strength, and you will do it. I will set you the example of\neating, if you still distrust the food in this house. Are you composed\nenough to give the servant her orders, if I ring the bell? It is\nnecessary to the object I have in view for you, that nobody should\nthink you ill in body or troubled in mind. Try first with me before the\nservant comes in. Let us see how you look and speak when you say, 'Bring\nup the lunch.'\"\n\nAfter two rehearsals, Mrs. Lecount considered him fit to give the order,\nwithout betraying himself.\n\nThe bell was answered by Louisa--Louisa looked hard at Mrs. Lecount. The\nluncheon was brought up by the house-maid--the house-maid looked hard\nat Mrs. Lecount. When luncheon was over, the table was cleared by the\ncook--the cook looked hard at Mrs. Lecount. The three servants were\nplainly suspicious that something extraordinary was going on in the\nhouse. It was hardly possible to doubt that they had arranged to share\namong themselves the three opportunities which the service of the table\nafforded them of entering the room.\n\nThe curiosity of which she was the object did not escape the penetration\nof Mrs. Lecount. \"I did well,\" she thought, \"to arm myself in good time\nwith the means of reaching my end. If I let the grass grow under my\nfeet, one or the other of those women might get in my way.\" Roused by\nthis consideration, she produced her traveling-bag from a corner, as\nsoon as the last of the servants had entered the room; and seating\nherself at the end of the table opposite Noel Vanstone, looked at him\nfor a moment, with a steady, investigating attention. She had carefully\nregulated the quantity of wine which he had taken at luncheon--she had\nlet him drink exactly enough to fortify, without confusing him; and she\nnow examined his face critically, like an artist examining his picture\nat the end of the day's work. The result appeared to satisfy her, and\nshe opened the serious business of the interview on the spot.\n\n\"Will you look at the written evidence I have mentioned to you, Mr.\nNoel, before I say any more?\" she inquired. \"Or are you sufficiently\npersuaded of the truth to proceed at once to the suggestion which I have\nnow to make to you?\"\n\n\"Let me hear your suggestion,\" he said, sullenly resting his elbows on\nthe table, and leaning his head on his hands.\n\nMrs. Lecount took from her traveling-bag the written evidence to which\nshe had just alluded, and carefully placed the papers on one side of\nhim, within easy reach, if he wished to refer to them. Far from being\ndaunted, she was visibly encouraged by the ungraciousness of his manner.\nHer experience of him informed her that the sign was a promising one.\nOn those rare occasions when the little resolution that he possessed\nwas roused in him, it invariably asserted itself--like the resolution\nof most other weak men--aggressively. At such times, in proportion as he\nwas outwardly sullen and discourteous to those about him, his resolution\nrose; and in proportion as he was considerate and polite, it fell. The\ntone of the answer he had just given, and the attitude he assumed at the\ntable, convinced Mrs. Lecount that Spanish wine and Scotch mutton had\ndone their duty, and had rallied his sinking courage.\n\n\"I will put the question to you for form's sake, sir, if you wish it,\"\nshe proceeded. \"But I am already certain, without any question at all,\nthat you have made your will?\"\n\nHe nodded his head without looking at her.\n\n\"You have made it in your wife's favor?\"\n\nHe nodded again.\n\n\"You have left her everything you possess?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount looked surprised.\n\n\"Did you exercise a reserve toward her, Mr. Noel, of your own accord?\"\nshe inquired; \"or is it possible that your wife put her own limits to\nher interest in your will?\"\n\nHe was uneasily silent--he was plainly ashamed to answer the question.\nMrs. Lecount repeated it in a less direct form.\n\n\"How much have you left your widow, Mr. Noel, in the event of your\ndeath?\"\n\n\"Eighty thousand pounds.\"\n\nThat reply answered the question. Eighty thousand pounds was exactly\nthe fortune which Michael Vanstone had taken from his brother's orphan\nchildren at his brother's death--exactly the fortune of which Michael\nVanstone's son had kept possession, in his turn, as pitilessly as\nhis father before him. Noel Vanstone's silence was eloquent of the\nconfession which he was ashamed to make. His doting weakness had, beyond\nall doubt, placed his whole property at the feet of his wife. And thi s\ngirl, whose vindictive daring had defied all restraints--this girl,\nwho had not shrunk from her desperate determination even at the church\ndoor--had, in the very hour of her triumph, taken part only from the man\nwho would willingly have given all!--had rigorously exacted her father's\nfortune from him to the last farthing; and had then turned her back\non the hand that was tempting her with tens of thousands more! For the\nmoment, Mrs. Lecount was fairly silenced by her own surprise; Magdalen\nhad forced the astonishment from her which is akin to admiration,\nthe astonishment which her enmity would fain have refused. She hated\nMagdalen with a tenfold hatred from that time.\n\n\"I have no doubt, sir,\" she resumed, after a momentary silence, \"that\nMrs. Noel gave you excellent reasons why the provision for her at your\ndeath should be no more, and no less, than eighty thousand pounds. And,\non the other hand, I am equally sure that you, in your innocence of all\nsuspicion, found those reasons conclusive at the time. That time has now\ngone by. Your eyes are opened, sir; and you will not fail to remark (as\nI remark) that the Combe-Raven property happens to reach the same sum\nexactly, as the legacy which your wife's own instructions directed you\nto leave her. If you are still in any doubt of the motive for which she\nmarried you, look in your own will--and there the motive is!\"\n\nHe raised his head from his hands, and became closely attentive to what\nshe was saying to him, for the first time since they had faced each\nother at the table. The Combe-Raven property had never been classed\nby itself in his estimation. It had come to him merged in his father's\nother possessions, at his father's death. The discovery which had now\nopened before him was one to which his ordinary habits of thought, as\nwell as his innocence of suspicion, had hitherto closed his eyes. He\nsaid nothing; but he looked less sullenly at Mrs. Lecount. His manner\nwas more ingratiating; the high tide of his courage was already on the\nebb.\n\n\"Your position, sir, must be as plain by this time to you as it is to\nme,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"There is only one obstacle now left between\nthis woman and the attainment of her end. _That obstacle is your life._\nAfter the discovery we have made upstairs, I leave you to consider for\nyourself what your life is worth.\"\n\nAt those terrible words, the ebbing resolution in him ran out to the\nlast drop. \"Don't frighten me!\" he pleaded; \"I have been frightened\nenough already.\" He rose, and dragged his chair after him, round the\ntable to Mrs. Lecount's side. He sat down and caressingly kissed her\nhand. \"You good creature!\" he said, in a sinking voice. \"You excellent\nLecount! Tell me what to do. I'm full of resolution--I'll do anything to\nsave my life!\"\n\n\"Have you got writing materials in the room, sir?\" asked Mrs. Lecount.\n\"Will you put them on the table, if you please?\"\n\nWhile the writing materials were in process of collection, Mrs. Lecount\nmade a new demand on the resources of her traveling-bag. She took two\npapers from it, each indorsed in the same neat commercial handwriting.\nOne was described as \"Draft for proposed Will,\" and the other as \"Draft\nfor proposed Letter.\" When she placed them before her on the table, her\nhand shook a little; and she applied the smelling-salts, which she had\nbrought with her in Noel Vanstone's interests, to her own nostrils.\n\n\"I had hoped, when I came here, Mr. Noel,\" she proceeded, \"to have given\nyou more time for consideration than it seems safe to give you now.\nWhen you first told me of your wife's absence in London, I thought it\nprobable that the object of her journey was to see her sister and Miss\nGarth. Since the horrible discovery we have made upstairs, I am inclined\nto alter that opinion. Your wife's determination not to tell you who the\nfriends are whom she has gone to see, fills me with alarm. She may\nhave accomplices in London--accomplices, for anything we know to the\ncontrary, in this house. All three of your servants, sir, have taken the\nopportunity, in turn, of coming into the room and looking at me. I don't\nlike their looks! Neither you nor I know what may happen from day to\nday, or even from hour to hour. If you take my advice, you will get the\nstart at once of all possible accidents; and, when the carriage comes\nback, you will leave this house with me!\"\n\n\"Yes, yes!\" he said, eagerly; \"I'll leave the house with you. I wouldn't\nstop here by myself for any sum of money that could be offered me. What\ndo we want the pen and ink for? Are you to write, or am I?\"\n\n\"You are to write, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"The means taken for\npromoting your own safety are to be means set in motion, from beginning\nto end, by yourself. I suggest, Mr. Noel--and you decide. Recognize\nyour own position, sir. What is your first and foremost necessity? It\nis plainly this. You must destroy your wife's interest in your death by\nmaking another will.\"\n\nHe vehemently nodded his approval; his color rose, and his blinking eyes\nbrightened in malicious triumph. \"She shan't have a farthing,\" he said\nto himself, in a whisper--\"she shan't have a farthing!\"\n\n\"When your will is made, sir,\" proceeded Mrs. Lecount, \"you must place\nit in the hands of a trustworthy person--not my hands, Mr. Noel; I am\nonly your servant! Then, when the will is safe, and when you are safe,\nwrite to your wife at this house. Tell her her infamous imposture\nis discovered; tell her you have made a new will, which leaves her\npenniless at your death; tell her, in your righteous indignation, that\nshe enters your doors no more. Place yourself in that strong position,\nand it is no longer you who are at your wife's mercy, but your wife who\nis at yours. Assert your own power, sir, with the law to help you, and\ncrush this woman into submission to any terms for the future that you\nplease to impose.\"\n\nHe eagerly took up the pen. \"Yes,\" he said, with a vindictive\nself-importance, \"any terms I please to impose.\" He suddenly checked\nhimself and his face became dejected and perplexed. \"How can I do it\nnow?\" he asked, throwing down the pen as quickly as he had taken it up.\n\n\"Do what, sir?\" inquired Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"How can I make my will, with Mr. Loscombe away in London, and no lawyer\nhere to help me?\"\n\nMrs. Lecount gently tapped the papers before her on the table with her\nforefinger.\n\n\"All the help you need, sir, is waiting for you here,\" she said. \"I\nconsidered this matter carefully before I came to you; and I provided\nmyself with the confidential assistance of a friend to guide me through\nthose difficulties which I could not penetrate for myself. The friend\nto whom I refer is a gentleman of Swiss extraction, but born and bred\nin England. He is not a lawyer by profession--but he has had his own\nsufficient experience of the law, nevertheless; and he has supplied\nme, not only with a model by which you may make your will, but with the\nwritten sketch of a letter which it is as important for us to have, as\nthe model of the will itself. There is another necessity waiting for\nyou, Mr. Noel, which I have not mentioned yet, but which is no less\nurgent in its way than the necessity of the will.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" he asked, with roused curiosity.\n\n\"We will take it in its turn, sir,\" answered Mrs. Lecount. \"Its turn has\nnot come yet. The will, if you please, first. I will dictate from the\nmodel in my possession and you will write.\"\n\nNoel Vanstone looked at the draft for the Will and the draft for the\nLetter with suspicious curiosity.\n\n\"I think I ought to see the papers myself, before you dictate,\" he said.\n\"It would be more satisfactory to my own mind, Lecount.\"\n\n\"By all means, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Lecount, handing him the papers\nimmediately.\n\nHe read the draft for the Will first, pausing and knitting his brows\ndistrustfully, wherever he found blank spaces left in the manuscript\nto be filled in with the names of persons and the enumeration of sums\nbequeathed to them. Two or three minutes of reading brought him to the\nend of the paper. He gave it back to Mrs. Lecount without making any\nobjection to it.\n\nThe draft for the Letter was a much longer document. He obstinately read\nit through to the end, with an expression of perplexity and discontent\nwhich showed that it was utterly unintelligible to him. \"I must have\nthis explained,\" he said, with a touch of his old self-importance,\n\"before I take any steps in the matter.\"\n\n\"It shall be explained, sir, as we go on,\" said Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Every word of it?\"\n\n\"Every word of it, Mr. Noel, when its turn comes. You have no objection\nto the will? To the will, then, as I said before, let us devote\nourselves first. You have seen for yourself that it is short enough and\nsimple enough for a child to understand it. But if any doubts remain on\nyour mind, by all means compose those doubts by showing your will to\na lawyer by profession. In the meantime, let me not be considered\nintrusive if I remind you that we are all mortal, and that the lost\nopportunity can never be recalled. While your time is your own, sir, and\nwhile your enemies are unsuspicious of you, make your will!\"\n\nShe opened a sheet of note-paper and smoothed it out before him; she\ndipped the pen in ink, and placed it in his hands. He took it from\nher without speaking--he was, to all appearance, suffering under some\ntemporary uneasiness of mind. But the main point was gained. There he\nsat, with the paper before him, and the pen in his hand; ready at last,\nin right earnest, to make his will.\n\n\"The first question for you to decide, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, after a\npreliminary glance at her Draft, \"is your choice of an executor. I have\nno desire to influence your decision; but I may, without impropriety,\nremind you that a wise choice means, in other words, the choice of an\nold and tried friend whom you know that you can trust.\"\n\n\"It means the admiral, I suppose?\" said Noel Vanstone.\n\nMrs. Lecount bowed.\n\n\"Very well,\" he continued. \"The admiral let it be.\"\n\nThere was plainly some oppression still weighing on his mind. Even under\nthe trying circumstances in which he was placed it was not in his nature\nto take Mrs. Lecount's perfectly sensible and disinterested advice\nwithout a word of cavil, as he had taken it now.\n\n\"Are you ready, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount dictated the first paragraph from the Draft, as follows:\n\n\n\"This is the last Will and Testament of me, Noel Vanstone, now living\nat Baliol Cottage, near Dumfries. I revoke, absolutely and in every\nparticular, my former will executed on the thirtieth of September,\neighteen hundred and forty-seven; and I hereby appoint Rear-Admiral\nArthur Everard Bartram, of St. Crux-in-the-Marsh, Essex, sole executor\nof this my will.\"\n\n\n\"Have you written those words, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount laid down the Draft; Noel Vanstone laid down the pen. They\nneither of them looked at each other. There was a long silence.\n\n\"I am waiting, Mr. Noel,\" said Mrs. Lecount, at last, \"to hear what\nyour wishes are in respect to the disposal of your fortune. Your _large_\nfortune,\" she added, with merciless emphasis.\n\nHe took up the pen again, and began picking the feathers from the quill\nin dead silence.\n\n\"Perhaps your existing will may help you to instruct me, sir,\" pursued\nMrs. Lecount. \"May I inquire to whom you left all your surplus money,\nafter leaving the eighty thousand pounds to your wife?\"\n\nIf he had answered that question plainly, he must have said: \"I have\nleft the whole surplus to my cousin, George Bartram\"--and the implied\nacknowledgment that Mrs. Lecount's name was not mentioned in the will\nmust then have followed in Mrs. Lecount's presence. A much bolder man,\nin his situation, might have felt the same oppression and the same\nembarrassment which he was feeling now. He picked the last morsel of\nfeather from the quill; and, desperately leaping the pitfall under his\nfeet, advanced to meet Mrs. Lecount's claims on him of his own accord.\n\n\"I would rather not talk of any will but the will I am making now,\" he\nsaid uneasily. \"The first thing, Lecount--\" He hesitated--put the bare\nend of the quill into his mouth--gnawed at it thoughtfully--and said no\nmore.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\" persisted Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"The first thing is--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"The first thing is, to--to make some provision for You?\"\n\nHe spoke the last words in a tone of plaintive interrogation--as if all\nhope of being met by a magnanimous refusal had not deserted him even\nyet. Mrs. Lecount enlightened his mind on this point, without a moment's\nloss of time.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Noel,\" she said, with the tone and manner of a woman who\nwas not acknowledging a favor, but receiving a right.\n\nHe took another bite at the quill. The perspiration began to appear on\nhis face.\n\n\"The difficulty is,\" he remarked, \"to say how much.\"\n\n\"Your lamented father, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \"met that difficulty\n(if you remember) at the time of his last illness?\"\n\n\"I don't remember,\" said Noel Vanstone, doggedly.\n\n\"You were on one side of his bed, sir, and I was on the other. We were\nvainly trying to persuade him to make his will. After telling us he\nwould wait and make his will when he was well again, he looked round at\nme, and said some kind and feeling words which my memory will treasure\nto my dying day. Have you forgotten those words, Mr. Noel?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Noel, without hesitation.\n\n\"In my present situation, sir,\" retorted Mrs. Lecount, \"delicacy forbids\nme to improve your memory.\"\n\nShe looked at her watch, and relapsed into silence. He clinched his\nhands, and writhed from side to side of his chair in an agony of\nindecision. Mrs. Lecount passively refused to take the slightest notice\nof him.\n\n\"What should you say--?\" he began, and suddenly stopped again.\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"What should you say to--a thousand pounds?\"\n\nMrs. Lecount rose from her chair, and looked him full in the face, with\nthe majestic indignation of an outraged woman.\n\n\"After the service I have rendered you to-day, Mr. Noel,\" she said, \"I\nhave at least earned a claim on your respect, if I have earned nothing\nmore. I wish you good-morning.\"\n\n\"Two thousand!\" cried Noel Vanstone, with the courage of despair.\n\nMrs. Lecount folded up her papers and hung her traveling-bag over her\narm in contemptuous silence.\n\n\"Three thousand!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount moved with impenetrable dignity from the table to the door.\n\n\"Four thousand!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount gathered her shawl round her with a shudder, and opened the\ndoor.\n\n\"Five thousand!\"\n\nHe clasped his hands, and wrung them at her in a frenzy of rage and\nsuspense. \"Five thousand\" was the death-cry of his pecuniary suicide.\n\nMrs. Lecount softly shut the door again, and came back a step.\n\n\"Free of legacy duty, sir?\" she inquired.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount turned on her heel and opened the door again.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount came back, and resumed her place at the table as if nothing\nhad happened.\n\n\"Five thousand pounds, free of legacy duty, was the sum, sir, which your\nfather's grateful regard promised me in his will,\" she said, quietly.\n\"If you choose to exert your memory, as you have not chosen to exert\nit yet, your memory will tell you that I speak the truth. I accept your\nfilial performance of your father's promise, Mr. Noel--and there I stop.\nI scorn to take a mean advantage of my position toward you; I scorn\nto grasp anything from your fears. You are protected by my respect for\nmyself, and for the Illustrious Name I bear. You are welcome to all that\nI have done, and to all that I have suffered in your service. The widow\nof Professor Lecompte, sir, takes what is justly hers--and takes no\nmore!\"\n\nAs she spoke those words, the traces of sickness seemed, for the moment,\nto disappear from her face; her eyes shone with a steady inner\nlight; all the woman warmed and brightened in the radiance of her own\ntriumph--the triumph, trebly won, of carrying her point, of vindicating\nher integrity, and of matching Magdalen's incorruptible self-denial on\nMagdalen's own ground.\n\n\"When you are yourself again, sir, we will proceed. Let us wait a little\nfirst.\"\n\nShe gave him time to compose himself; and then, after first looking at\nher Draft, dictated the second paragraph of the will, in these terms:\n\n\n\"I give and bequeath to Madame Virginie Lecompte (widow of Professor\nLecompt e, late of Zurich) the sum of Five Thousand Pounds, free of\nLegacy Duty. And, in making this bequest, I wi sh to place it on\nrecord that I am not only expressing my own sense of Madame Lecompte's\nattachment and fidelity in the capacity of my housekeeper, but that\nI also believe myself to be executing the intentions of my deceased\nfather, who, but for the circumstance of his dying intestate, would have\nleft Madame Lecompte, in _his_ will, the same token of grateful regard\nfor her services which I now leave her in mine.\"\n\n\n\"Have you written the last words, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount leaned across the table and offered Noel Vanstone her hand.\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Noel,\" she said. \"The five thousand pounds is the\nacknowledgment on your father's side of what I have done for him. The\nwords in the will are the acknowledgment on yours.\"\n\nA faint smile flickered over his face for the first time. It comforted\nhim, on reflection, to think that matters might have been worse. There\nwas balm for his wounded spirit in paying the debt of gratitude by a\nsentence not negotiable at his banker's. Whatever his father might have\ndone, _he_ had got Lecount a bargain, after all!\n\n\"A little more writing, sir,\" resumed Mrs. Lecount, \"and your painful\nbut necessary duty will be performed. The trifling matter of my legacy\nbeing settled, we may come to the important question that is left. The\nfuture direction of a large fortune is now waiting your word of command.\nTo whom is it to go?\"\n\nHe began to writhe again in his chair. Even under the all-powerful\nfascination of his wife the parting with his money on paper had not been\naccomplished without a pang. He had endured the pang; he had resigned\nhimself to the sacrifice. And now here was the dreaded ordeal again,\nawaiting him mercilessly for the second time!\n\n\"Perhaps it may assist your decision, sir, if I repeat a question which\nI have put to you already,\" observed Mrs. Lecount. \"In the will that\nyou made under your wife's influence, to whom did you leave the surplus\nmoney which remained at your own disposal?\"\n\nThere was no harm in answering the question now. He acknowledged that he\nhad left the money to his cousin George.\n\n\"You could have done nothing better, Mr. Noel; and you can do nothing\nbetter now,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"Mr. George and his two sisters are your\nonly relations left. One of those sisters is an incurable invalid, with\nmore than money enough already for all the wants which her affliction\nallows her to feel. The other is the wife of a man even richer than\nyourself. To leave the money to these sisters is to waste it. To leave\nthe money to their brother George is to give your cousin exactly the\nassistance which he will want when he one day inherits his uncle's\ndilapidated house and his uncle's impoverished estate. A will which\nnames the admiral your executor and Mr. George your heir is the right\nwill for you to make. It does honor to the claims of friendship, and it\ndoes justice to the claims of blood.\"\n\nShe spoke warmly; for she spoke with a grateful remembrance of all that\nshe herself owed to the hospitality of St. Crux. Noel Vanstone took up\nanother pen and began to strip the second quill of its feathers as he\nhad stripped the first.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, reluctantly, \"I suppose George must have it--I suppose\nGeorge has the principal claim on me.\" He hesitated: he looked at the\ndoor, he looked at the window, as if he longed to make his escape by one\nway or the other. \"Oh, Lecount,\" he cried, piteously, \"it's such a large\nfortune! Let me wait a little before I leave it to anybody.\"\n\nTo his surprise; Mrs. Lecount at once complied with this characteristic\nrequest.\n\n\"I wish you to wait, sir,\" she replied. \"I have something important to\nsay, before you add another line to your will. A little while since,\nI told you there was a second necessity connected with your present\nsituation, which had not been provided for yet, but which must be\nprovided for, when the time came. The time has come now. You have a\nserious difficulty to meet and conquer before you can leave your fortune\nto your cousin George.\"\n\n\"What difficulty?\" he asked.\n\nMrs. Lecount rose from her chair without answering, stole to the door,\nand suddenly threw it open. No one was listening outside; the passage\nwas a solitude, from one end to the other.\n\n\"I distrust all servants,\" she said, returning to her place--\"your\nservants particularly. Sit closer, Mr. Noel. What I have now to say to\nyou must be heard by no living creature but ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHERE was a pause of a few minutes while Mrs. Lecount opened the second\nof the two papers which lay before her on the table, and refreshed her\nmemory by looking it rapidly through. This done, she once more addressed\nherself to Noel Vanstone, carefully lowering her voice, so as to render\nit inaudible to any one who might be listening in the passage outside.\n\n\"I must beg your permission, sir,\" she began, \"to return to the subject\nof your wife. I do so most unwillingly; and I promise you that what I\nhave now to say about her shall be said, for your sake and for mine, in\nthe fewest words. What do we know of this woman, Mr. Noel--judging\nher by her own confession when she came to us in the character of Miss\nGarth, and by her own acts afterward at Aldborough? We know that, if\ndeath had not snatched your father out of her reach, she was ready with\nher plot to rob him of the Combe-Raven money. We know that, when you\ninherited the money in your turn, she was ready with her plot to rob\n_you_. We know how she carried that plot through to the end; and we\nknow that nothing but your death is wanted, at this moment, to crown her\nrapacity and her deception with success. We are sure of these things.\nWe are sure that she is young, bold, and clever--that she has neither\ndoubts, scruples, nor pity--and that she possesses the personal\nqualities which men in general (quite incomprehensibly to _me!_) are\nweak enough to admire. These are not fancies, Mr. Noel, but facts; you\nknow them as well as I do.\"\n\nHe made a sign in the affirmative, and Mrs. Lecount went on:\n\n\"Keep in your mind what I have said of the past, sir, and now look with\nme to the future. I hope and trust you have a long life still before\nyou; but let us, for the moment only, suppose the case of your\ndeath--your death leaving this will behind you, which gives your fortune\nto your cousin George. I am told there is an office in London in which\ncopies of all wills must be kept. Any curious stranger who chooses to\npay a shilling for the privilege may enter that office, and may read any\nwill in the place at his or her discretion. Do you see what I am coming\nto, Mr. Noel? Your disinherited widow pays her shilling, and reads your\nwill. Your disinherited widow sees that the Combe-Raven money, which has\ngone from your father to you, goes next from you to Mr. George Bartram.\nWhat is the certain end of that discovery? The end is, that you leave\nto your cousin and your friend the legacy of this woman's vengeance\nand this woman's deceit-vengeance made more resolute, deceit made more\ndevilish than ever, by her exasperation at her own failure. What is your\ncousin George? He is a generous, unsuspicious man; incapable of deceit\nhimself, and fearing no deception in others. Leave him at the mercy\nof your wife's unscrupulous fascinations and your wife's unfathomable\ndeceit, and I see the end as certainly as I see you sitting there! She\nwill blind his eyes, as she blinded yours; and, in spite of _you_, in\nspite of _me_, she will have the money!\"\n\nShe stopped, and left her last words time to gain their hold on his\nmind. The circumstances had been stated so clearly, the conclusion from\nthem had been so plainly drawn, that he seized her meaning without an\neffort, and seized it at once.\n\n\"I see!\" he said, vindictively clinching his hands. \"I understand,\nLecount! She shan't have a farthing. What shall I do? Shall I leave\nthe money to the admiral?\" He paused, and considered a little. \"No,\"\nhe resumed; \"there's the same danger in leaving it to the admiral that\nthere is in leaving it to George.\"\n\n\"There is no danger, Mr. Noel, if you take my advice.\"\n\n\"What is your advice?\"\n\n\"Follow your own idea, sir. Take the pen in hand again, and leave the\nmoney to Admiral Bartram.\"\n\nHe mechanically dipped the pen in the ink, and then hesitated.\n\n\"You shall know where I am leading you, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount, \"before\nyou sign your will. In the meantime, let us gain every inch of ground\nwe can, as we go on. I want the will to be all written out before we\nadvance a single step beyond it. Begin your third paragraph, Mr. Noel,\nunder the lines which leave me my legacy of five thousand pounds.\"\n\nShe dictated the last momentous sentence of the will (from the rough\ndraft in her own possession) in these words:\n\n\n\"The whole residue of my estate, after payment of my burial expenses\nand my lawful debts, I give and bequeath to Rear-Admiral Arthur Everard\nBartram, my Executor aforesaid; to be by him applied to such uses as he\nmay think fit.\n\n\"Signed, sealed, and delivered, this third day of November, eighteen\nhundred and forty-seven, by Noel Vanstone, the within-named testator, as\nand for his last Will and Testament, in the presence of us--\"\n\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked Noel Vanstone, in astonishment.\n\n\"That is enough, sir, to bequeath your fortune to the admiral; and\ntherefore that is all. Now let us go back to the case which we have\nsupposed already. Your widow pays her shilling, and sees this will.\nThere is the Combe-Raven money left to Admiral Bartram, with a\ndeclaration in plain words that it is his, to use as he likes. When she\nsees this, what does she do? She sets her trap for the admiral. He is a\nbachelor, and he is an old man. Who is to protect him against the arts\nof this desperate woman? Protect him yourself, sir, with a few more\nstrokes of that pen which has done such wonders already. You have left\nhim this legacy in your will--which your wife sees. Take the legacy away\nagain, in a letter--which is a dead secret between the admiral and\nyou. Put the will and the letter under one cover, and place them in the\nadmiral's possession, with your written directions to him to break the\nseal on the day of your death. Let the will say what it says now; and\nlet the letter (which is your secret and his) tell him the truth. Say\nthat, in leaving him your fortune, you leave it with the request that he\nwill take his legacy with one hand from you, and give it with the other\nto his nephew George. Tell him that your trust in this matter rests\nsolely on your confidence in his honor, and on your belief in his\naffectionate remembrance of your father and yourself. You have known the\nadmiral since you were a boy. He has his little whims and oddities; but\nhe is a gentleman from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot;\nand he is utterly incapable of proving false to a trust in his honor,\nreposed by his dead friend. Meet the difficulty boldly, by such a\nstratagem as this; and you save these two helpless men from your wife's\nsnare, one by means of the other. Here, on one side, is your will, which\ngives the fortune to the admiral, and sets her plotting accordingly. And\nthere, on the other side, is your letter, which privately puts the money\ninto the nephew's hands!\"\n\nThe malicious dexterity of this combination was exactly the dexterity\nwhich Noel Vanstone was most fit to appreciate. He tried to express\nhis approval and admiration in words. Mrs. Lecount held up her hand\nwarningly and closed his lips.\n\n\"Wait, sir, before you express your opinion,\" she went on. \"Half the\ndifficulty is all that we have conquered yet. Let us say, the admiral\nhas made the use of your legacy which you have privately requested him\nto make of it. Sooner or later, however well the secret may be kept,\nyour wife will discover the truth. What follows that discovery! She lays\nsiege to Mr. George. All you have done is to leave him the money by a\nroundabout way. There he is, after an interval of time, as much at\nher mercy as if you had openly mentioned him in your will. What is the\nremedy for this? The remedy is to mislead her, if we can, for the\nsecond time--to set up an obstacle between her and the money, for the\nprotection of your cousin George. Can you guess for yourself, Mr. Noel,\nwhat is the most promising obstacle we can put in her way?\"\n\nHe shook his head. Mrs. Lecount smiled, and startled him into close\nattention by laying her hand on his arm.\n\n\"Put a Woman in her way, sir!\" she whispered in her wiliest tones. \"_We_\ndon't believe in that fascinating beauty of hers--whatever _you_ may do.\n_Our_ lips don't burn to kiss those smooth cheeks. _Our_ arms don't\nlong to be round that supple waist. _We_ see through her smiles and her\ngraces, and her stays and her padding--she can't fascinate _us!_ Put a\nwoman in her way, Mr. Noel! Not a woman in my helpless situation, who\nis only a servant, but a woman with the authority and the jealousy of\na Wife. Make it a condition, in your letter to the admiral, that if Mr.\nGeorge is a bachelor at the time of your death, he shall marry within\na certain time afterward, or he shall not have the legacy. Suppose he\nremains single in spite of your condition, who is to have the money\nthen? Put a woman in your wife's way, sir, once more--and leave the\nfortune, in that case, to the married sister of your cousin George.\"\n\nShe paused. Noel Vanstone again attempted to express his opinion, and\nagain Mrs. Lecount's hand extinguished him in silence.\n\n\"If you approve, Mr. Noel,\" she said, \"I will take your approval for\ngranted. If you object, I will meet your objection before it is out of\nyour mouth. You may say: Suppose this condition is sufficient to answer\nthe purpose, why hide it in a private letter to the admiral? Why not\nopenly write it down, with my cousin's name, in the will? Only for one\nreason, sir. Only because the secret way is the sure way, with such a\nwoman as your wife. The more secret you can keep your intentions, the\nmore time you force her to waste in finding them out for herself.\nThat time which she loses is time gained from her treachery by the\nadmiral--time gained by Mr. George (if he is still a bachelor) for his\nundisturbed choice of a lady--time gained, for her own security, by the\nobject of his choice, who might otherwise be the first object of your\nwife's suspicion and your wife's hostility. Remember the bottle we\nhave discovered upstairs; and keep this desperate woman ignorant, and\ntherefore harmless, as long as you can. There is my advice, Mr. Noel,\nin the fewest and plainest words. What do you say, sir? Am I almost\nas clever in my way as your friend Mr. Bygrave? Can I, too, conspire a\nlittle, when the object of my conspiracy is to assist your wishes and to\nprotect your friends?\"\n\nPermitted the use of his tongue at last, Noel Vanstone's admiration of\nMrs. Lecount expressed itself in terms precisely similar to those which\nhe had used on a former occasion, in paying his compliments to Captain\nWragge. \"What a head you have got!\" were the grateful words which he\nhad once spoken to Mrs. Lecount's bitterest enemy. \"What a head you have\ngot!\" were the grateful words which he now spoke again to Mrs. Lecount\nherself. So do extremes meet; and such is sometimes the all-embracing\ncapacity of the approval of a fool!\n\n\"Allow my head, sir, to deserve the compliment which you have paid to\nit,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"The letter to the admiral is not written yet.\nYour will there is a body without a soul--an Adam without an Eve--until\nthe letter is completed and laid by its side. A little more dictation\non my part, a little more writing on yours, and our work is done. Pardon\nme. The letter will be longer than the will; we must have larger paper\nthan the note-paper this time.\"\n\nThe writing-case was searched, and some letter paper was found in it of\nthe size required. Mrs. Lecount resumed her dictation; and Noel Vanstone\nresumed his pen.\n\n\n\"Baliol Cottage, Dumfries,\n\n\"November 3d, 1847.\n\n\"Private.\n\n\"DEAR ADMIRAL BARTRAM--When you open my Will (in which you are named my\nsole executor), you will find that I have bequeathed the whole residue\nof my estate--after payment of one legacy of five thousand pounds--to\nyourself. It is the purpose of my letter to tell you privately what the\nobject is for which I have left you the fortune which is now placed in\nyour hands.\n\n\"I beg you to consider this large legacy as intended, under certain\nconditions, to be given by you to your nephew George. If your nephew is\nmarried at the time of my death, and if his wife is living, I request\nyou to put him at once in possession of your legacy; accompanying it by\nthe expression of my desire (which I am sure he will consider a sacred\nand binding obligation on him) that he will settle the money on his\nwife--and on his children, if he has any. If, on the other hand, he is\nunmarried at the time of my death, or if he is a widower--in either of\nthose cases, I make it a condition of his receiving the legacy, that he\nshall be married within the period of--\"\n\n\nMrs. Lecount laid down the Draft letter from which she had been\ndictating thus far, and informed Noel Vanstone by a sign that his pen\nmight rest.\n\n\"We have come to the question of time, sir,\" she observed. \"How long\nwill you give your cousin to marry, if he is single, or a widower, at\nthe time of your death?\"\n\n\"Shall I give him a year?\" inquired Noel Vanstone.\n\n\"If we had nothing to consider but the interests of Propriety,\" said\nMrs. Lecount, \"I should say a year too, sir--especially if Mr. George\nshould happen to be a widower. But we have your wife to consider, as\nwell as the interests of Propriety. A year of delay, between your death\nand your cousin's marriage, is a dangerously long time to leave the\ndisposal of your fortune in suspense. Give a determined woman a year to\nplot and contrive in, and there is no saying what she may not do.\"\n\n\"Six months?\" suggested Noel Vanstone.\n\n\"Six months, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \"is the preferable time of the\ntwo. A six months' interval from the day of your death is enough for Mr.\nGeorge. You look discomposed, sir; what is the matter?\"\n\n\"I wish you wouldn't talk so much about my death,\" he broke out,\npetulantly. \"I don't like it! I hate the very sound of the word!\"\n\nMrs. Lecount smiled resignedly, and referred to her Draft.\n\n\"I see the word 'decease' written here,\" she remarked. \"Perhaps, Mr.\nNoel, you would prefer it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" he said; \"I prefer 'Decease.' It doesn't sound so dreadful as\n'Death.'\"\n\n\"Let us go on with the letter, sir.\"\n\nShe resumed her dictation, as follows:\n\n\n\"...in either of those cases, I make it a condition of his receiving\nthe legacy that he shall be married within the period of Six calendar\nmonths from the day of my decease; that the woman he marries shall not\nbe a widow; and that his marriage shall be a marriage by Banns, publicly\ncelebrated in the parish church of Ossory--where he has been known from\nhis childhood, and where the family and circumstances of his future wife\nare likely to be the subject of public interest and inquiry.\"\n\n\n\"This,\" said Mrs. Lecount, quietly looking up from the Draft, \"is to\nprotect Mr. George, sir, in case the same trap is set for him which was\nsuccessfully set for you. She will not find her false character and her\nfalse name fit quite so easily next time--no, not even with Mr. Bygrave\nto help her! Another dip of ink, Mr. Noel; let us write the next\nparagraph. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount went on.\n\n\n\"If your nephew fails to comply with these conditions--that is to say,\nif being either a bachelor or a widower at the time of my decease, he\nfails to marry in all respects as I have here instructed him to marry,\nwithin Six calendar months from that time--it is my desire that he shall\nnot receive the legacy, or any part of it. I request you, in the case\nhere supposed, to pass him over altogether; and to give the fortune left\nyou in my will to his married sister, Mrs. Girdlestone.\n\n\"Having now put you in possession of my motives and intentions, I come\nto the next question which it is necessary to consider. If, when\nyou open this letter, your nephew is an unmarried man, it is clearly\nindispensable that he should know of the conditions here imposed on him,\nas soon, if possible, as you know of them yourself. Are you, under these\ncircumstances, freely to communicate to him what I have here written to\nyou? Or are you to leave him under the impression that no such private\nexpression of my wishes as this is in existence; and are you to state\nall the conditions relating to his marriage, as if they emanated\nentirely from yourself?\n\n\"If you will adopt this latter alternative, you will add one more to the\nmany obligations under which your friendship has placed me.\n\n\"I have serious reason to believe that the possession of my money, and\nthe discovery of any peculiar arrangements relating to the disposal of\nit, will be objects (after my decease) of the fraud and conspiracy of an\nunscrupulous person. I am therefore anxious--for your sake, in the\nfirst place--that no suspicion of the existence of this letter should\nbe conveyed to the mind of the person to whom I allude. And I am equally\ndesirous--for Mrs. Girdlestone's sake, in the second place--that this\nsame person should be entirely ignorant that the legacy will pass into\nMrs. Girdlestone's possession, if your nephew is not married in the\ngiven time. I know George's easy, pliable disposition; I dread the\nattempts that will be made to practice on it; and I feel sure that the\nprudent course will be, to abstain from trusting him with secrets,\nthe rash revelation of which might be followed by serious, and even\ndangerous results.\n\n\"State the conditions, therefore, to your nephew, as if they were your\nown. Let him think they have been suggested to your mind by the new\nresponsibilities imposed on you as a man of property, by your\nposition in my will, and by your consequent anxiety to provide for the\nperpetuation of the family name. If these reasons are not sufficient to\nsatisfy him, there can be no objection to your referring him, for any\nfurther explanations which he may desire, to his wedding-day.\n\n\"I have done. My last wishes are now confided to you, in implicit\nreliance on your honor, and on your tender regard for the memory of your\nfriend. Of the miserable circumstances which compel me to write as I\nhave written here, I say nothing. You will hear of them, if my life is\nspared, from my own lips--for you will be the first friend whom I shall\nconsult in my difficulty and distress. Keep this letter strictly secret,\nand strictly in your own possession, until my requests are complied\nwith. Let no human being but yourself know where it is, on any pretense\nwhatever.\n\n\"Believe me, dear Admiral Bartram, affectionately yours,\n\n\"NOEL VANSTONE.\"\n\n\n\"Have you signed, sir?\" asked Mrs. Lecount. \"Let me look the letter\nover, if you please, before we seal it up.\"\n\nShe read the letter carefully. In Noel Vanstone's close, cramped\nhandwriting, it filled two pages of letter-paper, and ended at the top\nof the third page. Instead of using an envelope, Mrs. Lecount folded it,\nneatly and securely, in the old-fashioned way. She lit the taper in the\nink-stand, and returned the letter to the writer.\n\n\"Seal it, Mr. Noel,\" she said, \"with your own hand, and your own seal.\"\nShe extinguished the taper, and handed him the pen again. \"Address\nthe letter, sir,\" she proceeded, \"to _Admiral Bartram, St.\nCrux-in-the-Marsh, Essex._ Now, add these words, and sign them, above\nthe address: _To be kept in your own possession, and to be opened by\nyourself only, on the day of my death_--or 'Decease,' if you prefer\nit--_Noel Vanstone._ Have you done? Let me look at it again. Quite right\nin every particular. Accept my congratulations, sir. If your wife has\nnot plotted her last plot for the Combe-Raven money, it is not your\nfault, Mr. Noel--and not mine!\"\n\nFinding his attention released by the completion of the letter, Noel\nVanstone reverted at once to purely personal considerations. \"There is\nmy packing-up to be thought of now,\" he said. \"I can't go away without\nmy warm things.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" rejoined Mrs. Lecount, \"there is the Will to be signed\nfirst; and there must be two persons found to witness your signature.\"\nShe looked out of the front window, and saw the carriage waiting at the\ndoor. \"The coachman will do for one of the witnesses,\" she said. \"He is\nin respectable service at Dumfries, and he can be found if he happens\nto be wanted. We must have one of your own servants, I suppose, for the\nother witness. They are all de testable women; but the cook is the least\nill-looking of the three. Send for the cook, sir; while I go out and\ncall the coachman. When we have got our witnesses here, you have only to\nspeak to them in these words: 'I have a document here to sign, and I\nwish you to write your names on it, as witnesses of my signature.'\nNothing more, Mr. Noel! Say those few words in your usual manner--and,\nwhen the signing is over, I will see myself to your packing-up, and your\nwarm things.\"\n\nShe went to the front door, and summoned the coachman to the parlor.\nOn her return, she found the cook already in the room. The cook looked\nmysteriously offended, and stared without intermission at Mrs. Lecount.\nIn a minute more the coachman--an elderly man--came in. He was preceded\nby a relishing odor of whisky; but his head was Scotch; and nothing but\nhis odor betrayed him.\n\n\"I have a document here to sign,\" said Noel Vanstone, repeating his\nlesson; \"and I wish you to write your names on it, as witnesses of my\nsignature.\"\n\nThe coachman looked at the will. The cook never removed her eyes from\nMrs. Lecount.\n\n\"Ye'll no object, sir,\" said the coachman, with the national caution\nshowing itself in every wrinkle on his face--\"ye'll no object, sir, to\ntell me, first, what the Doecument may be?\"\n\nMrs. Lecount interposed before Noel Vanstone's indignation could express\nitself in words.\n\n\"You must tell the man, sir, that this is your Will,\" she said. \"When he\nwitnesses your signature, he can see as much for himself if he looks at\nthe top of the page.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said the coachman, looking at the top of the page immediately.\n\"His last Will and Testament. Hech, sirs! there's a sair confronting\nof Death in a Doecument like yon! A' flesh is grass,\" continued the\ncoachman, exhaling an additional puff of whisky, and looking up\ndevoutly at the ceiling. \"Tak' those words in connection with that other\nScreepture: Many are ca'ad, but few are chosen. Tak' that again, in\nconnection with Rev'lations, Chapter the First, verses One to Fefteen.\nLay the whole to heart; and what's your Walth, then? Dross, sirs! And\nyour body? (Screepture again.) Clay for the potter! And your life?\n(Screepture once more.) The Breeth o' your Nostrils!\"\n\nThe cook listened as if the cook was at church: but she never removed\nher eyes from Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"You had better sign, sir. This is apparently some custom prevalent\nin Dumfries during the transaction of business,\" said Mrs. Lecount,\nresignedly. \"The man means well, I dare say.\"\n\nShe added those last words in a soothing tone, for she saw that Noel\nVanstone's indignation was fast merging into alarm. The coachman's\noutburst of exhortation seemed to have inspired him with fear, as well\nas disgust.\n\nHe dipped the pen in the ink, and signed the Will without uttering a\nword. The coachman (descending instantly from Theology to Business)\nwatched the signature with the most scrupulous attention; and signed his\nown name as witness, with an implied commentary on the proceeding, in\nthe form of another puff of whisky, exhaled through the medium of\na heavy sigh. The cook looked away from Mrs. Lecount with an\neffort--signed her name in a violent hurry--and looked back again with\na start, as if she expected to see a loaded pistol (produced in the\ninterval) in the housekeeper's hands. \"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Lecount,\nin her friendliest manner. The cook shut up her lips aggressively and\nlooked at her master. \"You may go!\" said her master. The cook coughed\ncontemptuously, and went.\n\n\"We shan't keep you long,\" said Mrs. Lecount, dismissing the coachman.\n\"In half an hour, or less, we shall be ready for the journey back.\"\n\nThe coachman's austere countenance relaxed for the first time. He smiled\nmysteriously, and approached Mrs. Lecount on tiptoe.\n\n\"Ye'll no forget one thing, my leddy,\" he said, with the most\ningratiating politeness. \"Ye'll no forget the witnessing as weel as the\ndriving, when ye pay me for my day's wark!\" He laughed with guttural\ngravity; and, leaving his atmosphere behind him, stalked out of the\nroom.\n\n\"Lecount,\" said Noel Vanstone, as soon as the coachman closed the door,\n\"did I hear you tell that man we should be ready in half an hour?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Are you blind?\"\n\nHe asked the question with an angry stamp of his foot. Mrs. Lecount\nlooked at him in astonishment.\n\n\"Can't you see the brute is drunk?\" he went on, more and more irritably.\n\"Is my life nothing? Am I to be left at the mercy of a drunken coachman?\nI won't trust that man to drive me, for any consideration under heaven!\nI'm surprised you could think of it, Lecount.\"\n\n\"The man has been drinking, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"It is easy to see\nand to smell that. But he is evidently used to drinking. If he is sober\nenough to walk quite straight--which he certainly does--and to sign his\nname in an excellent handwriting--which you may see for yourself on the\nWill--I venture to think he is sober enough to drive us to Dumfries.\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort! You're a foreigner, Lecount; you don't understand\nthese people. They drink whisky from morning to night. Whisky is the\nstrongest spirit that's made; whisky is notorious for its effect on the\nbrain. I tell you, I won't run the risk. I never was driven, and I never\nwill be driven, by anybody but a sober man.\"\n\n\"Must I go back to Dumfries by myself, sir?\"\n\n\"And leave me here? Leave me alone in this house after what has\nhappened? How do I know my wife may not come back to-night? How do I\nknow her journey is not a blind to mislead me? Have you no feeling,\nLecount? Can you leave me in my miserable situation--?\" He sank into a\nchair and burst out crying over his own idea, before he had completed\nthe expression of it in words. \"Too bad!\" he said, with his handkerchief\nover his face--\"too bad!\"\n\nIt was impossible not to pity him. If ever mortal was pitiable, he\nwas the man. He had broken down at last, under the conflict of violent\nemotions which had been roused in him since the morning. The effort to\nfollow Mrs. Lecount along the mazes of intricate combination through\nwhich she had steadily led the way, had upheld him while that effort\nlasted: the moment it was at an end, he dropped. The coachman had\nhastened a result--of which the coachman was far from being the cause.\n\n\"You surprise me--you distress me, sir,\" said Mrs. Lecount. \"I entreat\nyou to compose yourself. I will stay here, if you wish it, with\npleasure--I will stay here to-night, for your sake. You want rest and\nquiet after this dreadful day. The coachman shall be instantly sent\naway, Mr. Noel. I will give him a note to the landlord of the hotel, and\nthe carriage shall come back for us to-morrow morning, with another man\nto drive it.\"\n\nThe prospect which those words presented cheered him. He wiped his\neyes, and kissed Mrs. Lecount's hand. \"Yes!\" he said, faintly; \"send\nthe coachman away--and you stop here. You good creature! You excellent\nLecount! Send the drunken brute away, and come back directly. We will\nbe comfortable by the fire, Lecount--and have a nice little dinner--and\ntry to make it like old times.\" His weak voice faltered; he returned to\nthe fire side, and melted into tears again under the pathetic influence\nof his own idea.\n\nMrs. Lecount left him for a minute to dismiss the coachman. When she\nreturned to the parlor she found him with his hand on the bell.\n\n\"What do you want, sir?\" she asked.\n\n\"I want to tell the servants to get your room ready,\" he answered. \"I\nwish to show you every attention, Lecount.\"\n\n\"You are all kindness, Mr. Noel; but wait one moment. It may be well to\nhave these papers put out of the way before the servant comes in\nagain. If you will place the Will and the Sealed Letter together in one\nenvelope--and if you will direct it to the admiral--I will take care\nthat the inclosure so addressed is safely placed in his own hands. Will\nyou come to the table, Mr. Noel, only for one minute more?\"\n\nNo! He was obstinate; he refused to move from the fire; he was sick and\ntired of writing: he wished he had never been born, and he loathed the\nsight of pen and ink. All Mrs. Lecount's patience and all Mrs. Lecount's\npersuasion were required to induce him to write the admiral's address\nfor the second time. She only succeeded by bringing the blank envelope\nto him upon the paper-case, and putting it coaxingly on his lap. He\ngrumbled, he even swore, but he directed the envelope at last, in these\nterms: \"To Admiral Bartram, St. Crux-in-the-Marsh. Favored by Mrs.\nLecount.\" With that final act of compliance his docility came to an end.\nHe refused, in the fiercest terms, to seal the envelope. There was no\nneed to press this proceeding on him. His seal lay ready on the table,\nand it mattered nothing whether he used it, or whether a person in his\nconfidence used it for him. Mrs. Lecount sealed the envelope, with its\ntwo important inclosures placed safely inside.\n\nShe opened her traveling-bag for the last time, and pausing for a moment\nbefore she put the sealed packet away, looked at it with a triumph\ntoo deep for words. She smiled as she dropped it into the bag. Not the\nshadow of a suspicion that the Will might contain superfluous phrases\nand expressions which no practical lawyer would have used; not the\nvestige of a doubt whether the Letter was quite as complete a document\nas a practical lawyer might have made it, troubled her mind. In blind\nreliance--born of her hatred for Magdalen and her hunger for revenge--in\nblind reliance on her own abilities and on her friend's law, she trusted\nthe future implicitly to the promise of the morning's work.\n\nAs she locked her traveling-bag Noel Vanstone rang the bell. On this\noccasion, the summons was answered by Louisa.\n\n\"Get the spare room ready,\" said her master; \"this lady will sleep\nhere to-night. And air my warm things; this lady and I are going away\nto-morrow morning.\"\n\nThe civil and submissive Louisa received her orders in sullen\nsilence--darted an angry look at her master's impenetrable guest--and\nleft the room. The servants were evidently all attached to their\nmistress's interests, and were all of one opinion on the subject of Mrs.\nLecount.\n\n\"That's done!\" said Noel Vanstone, with a sigh of infinite relief.\n\"Come and sit down, Lecount. Let's be comfortable--let's gossip over the\nfire.\"\n\nMrs. Lecount accepted the invitation and drew an easy-chair to his side.\nHe took her hand with a confidential tenderness, and held it in his\nwhile the talk went on. A stranger, looking in through the window, would\nhave taken them for mother and son, and would have thought to himself:\n\"What a happy home!\"\n\nThe gossip, led by Noel Vanstone, consisted as usual of an endless\nstring of questions, and was devoted entirely to the subject of himself\nand his future prospects. Where would Lecount take him to when they went\naway the next morning? Why to London? Why should he be left in London,\nwhile Lecount went on to St. Crux to give the admiral the Letter and the\nWill? Because his wife might follow him, if he went to the admiral's?\nWell, there was something in that. And because he ought to be safely\nconcealed from her, in some comfortable lodging, near Mr. Loscombe? Why\nnear Mr. Loscombe? Ah, yes, to be sure--to know what the law would do\nto help him. Would the law set him free from the Wretch who had deceived\nhim? How tiresome of Lecount not to know! Would the law say he had gone\nand married himself a second time, because he had been living with\nthe Wretch, like husband and wife, in Scotland? Anything that publicly\nassumed to be a marriage was a marriage (he had heard) in Scotland. How\nexcessively tiresome of Lecount to sit there and say she knew nothing\nabout it! Was he to stay long in London by himself, with nobody but Mr.\nLoscombe to speak to? Would Lecount come back to him as soon as she had\nput those important papers in the admiral's own hands? Would Lecount\nconsider herself still in his service? The good Lecount! the excellent\nLecount! And after all the law-business was over--what then? Why not\nleave this horrid England and go abroad again? Why not go to France, to\nsome cheap place near Paris? Say Versailles? say St. Germain? In a nice\nlittle French house--cheap? With a nice French _bonne_ to cook--who\nwouldn't waste his substance in the grease-pot? With a nice little\ngarden--where he could work himself, and get health, and save the\nexpense of keeping a gardener? It wasn't a bad idea. And it seemed to\npromise well for the future--didn't it, Lecount?\n\nSo he ran on--the poor weak creature! the abject, miserable little man!\n\nAs the darkness gathered at the close of the short November day he began\nto grow drowsy--his ceaseless questions came to an end at last--he fell\nasleep. The wind outside sang its mournful winter-song; the tramp of\npassing footsteps, the roll of passing wheels on the road ceased in\ndreary silence. He slept on quietly. The firelight rose and fell on his\nwizen little face and his nervous, drooping hands. Mrs. Lecount had not\npitied him yet. She began to pity him now. Her point was gained; her\ninterest in his will was secured; he had put his future life, of his\nown accord, under her fostering care--the fire was comfortable; the\ncircumstances were favorable to the growth of Christian feeling.\n\"Poor wretch!\" said Mrs. Lecount, looking at him with a grave\ncompassion--\"poor wretch!\"\n\nThe dinner-hour roused him. He was cheerful at dinner; he reverted to\nthe idea of the cheap little house in France; he smirked and simpered;\nand talked French to Mrs. Lecount, while the house-maid and Louisa\nwaited, turn and turn about, under protest. When dinner was over, he\nreturned to his comfortable chair before the fire, and Mrs. Lecount\nfollowed him. He resumed the conversation--which meant, in his case,\nrepeating his questions. But he was not so quick and ready with them as\nhe had been earlier in the day. They began to flag--they continued, at\nlonger and longer intervals--they ceased altogether. Toward nine o'clock\nhe fell asleep again.\n\nIt was not a quiet sleep this time. He muttered, and ground his teeth,\nand rolled his head from side to side of the chair. Mrs. Lecount\npurposely made noise enough to rouse him. He woke, with a vacant eye and\na flushed cheek. He walked about the room restlessly, with a new idea\nin his mind--the idea of writing a terrible letter; a letter of eternal\nfarewell to his wife. How was it to be written? In what language should\nhe express his feelings? The powers of Shakespeare himself would be\nunequal to the emergency! He had been the victim of an outrage entirely\nwithout parallel. A wretch had crept into his bosom! A viper had hidden\nherself at his fireside! Where could words be found to brand her with\nthe infamy she deserved? He stopped, with a suffocating sense in him of\nhis own impotent rage--he stopped, and shook his fist tremulously in the\nempty air.\n\nMrs. Lecount interfered with an energy and a resolution inspired by\nserious alarm. After the heavy strain that had been laid on his weakness\nalready, such an outbreak of passionate agitation as was now bursting\nfrom him might be the destruction of his rest that night and of his\nstrength to travel the next day. With infinite difficulty, with endless\npromises to return to the subject, and to advise him about it in the\nmorning, she prevailed on him, at last, to go upstairs and compose\nhimself for the night. She gave him her arm to assist him. On the way\nupstairs his attention, to her great relief, became suddenly absorbed\nby a new fancy. He remembered a certain warm and comfortable mixture of\nwine, eggs, sugar, and spices, which she had often been accustomed to\nmake for him in former times, and which he thought he should relish\nexceedingly before he went to bed. Mrs. Lecount helped him on with his\ndressing-gown--then went down-stairs again to make his warm drink for\nhim at the parlor fire.\n\nShe rang the bell and ordered the necessary ingredients for the mixture,\nin Noel Vanstone's name. The servants, with the small ingenious malice\nof their race, brought up the materials one by one, and kept her waiting\nfor each of them as long as possible. She had got the saucepan, and the\nspoon, and the tumbler, and the nutmeg-grater, and the wine--but not\nthe egg, the sugar, or the spices--when she heard him above, walking\nbackward and forward noisily in his room; exciting hi mself on the old\nsubject again, beyond all doubt.\n\nShe went upstairs once more; but he was too quick for her--he heard her\noutside the door; and when she opened it, she found him in his chair,\nwith his back cunningly turned toward her. Knowing him too well to\nattempt any remonstrance, she merely announced the speedy arrival of the\nwarm drink and turned to leave the room. On her way out, she noticed a\ntable in a corner, with an inkstand and a paper-case on it, and tried,\nwithout attracting his attention, to take the writing materials away.\nHe was too quick for her again. He asked, angrily, if she doubted his\npromise. She put the writing materials back on the table, for fear of\noffending him, and left the room.\n\nIn half an hour more the mixture was ready. She carried it up to him,\nfoaming and fragrant, in a large tumbler. \"He will sleep after this,\"\nshe thought to herself, as she opened the door; \"I have made it stronger\nthan usual on purpose.\"\n\nHe had changed his place. He was sitting at the table in the\ncorner--still with his back to her, writing. This time his quick ears\nhad not served him; this time she caught him in the fact.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Noel! Mr. Noel!\" she said, reproachfully, \"what is your promise\nworth?\"\n\nHe made no answer. He was sitting with his left elbow on the table, and\nwith his head resting on his left hand. His right hand lay back on the\npaper, with the pen lying loose in it. \"Your drink, Mr. Noel,\" she said,\nin a kinder tone, feeling unwilling to offend him. He took no notice of\nher. She went to the table to rouse him. Was he deep in thought?\n\nHe was dead!\n\nTHE END OF THE FIFTH SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\n\n\nI.\n\n_From Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Mr. Loscombe._\n\n\"Park Terrace, St. John's Wood, November 5th.\n\n\"DEAR SIR--I came to London yesterday for the purpose of seeing a\nrelative, leaving Mr. Vanstone at Baliol Cottage, and proposing to\nreturn to him in the course of the week. I reached London late\nlast night, and drove to these lodgings, having written to secure\naccommodation beforehand.\n\n\"This morning's post has brought me a letter from my own maid, whom I\nleft at Baliol Cottage, with instructions to write to me if anything\nextraordinary took place in my absence. You will find the girl's letter\ninclosed in this. I have had some experience of her; and I believe she\nis to be strictly depended on to tell the truth.\n\n\"I purposely abstain from troubling you by any useless allusions to\nmyself. When you have read my maid's letter, you will understand the\nshock which the news contained in it has caused me. I can only repeat\nthat I place implicit belief in her statement. I am firmly persuaded\nthat my husband's former housekeeper has found him out, has practiced\non his weakness in my absence, and has prevailed on him to make another\nWill. From what I know of this woman, I feel no doubt that she has\nused her influence over Mr. Vanstone to deprive me, if possible, of all\nfuture interests in my husband's fortune.\n\n\"Under such circumstances as these, it is in the last degree\nimportant--for more reasons than I need mention here--that I should\nsee Mr. Vanstone, and come to an explanation with him, at the earliest\npossible opportunity. You will find that my maid thoughtfully kept her\nletter open until the last moment before post-time--without, however,\nhaving any later news to give me than that Mrs. Lecount was to sleep\nat the cottage last night and that she and Mr. Vanstone were to leave\ntogether this morning. But for that last piece of intelligence, I should\nhave been on my way back to Scotland before now. As it is, I cannot\ndecide for myself what I ought to do next. My going back to Dumfries,\nafter Mr. Vanstone has left it, seems like taking a journey for nothing\n--and my staying in London appears to be almost equally useless.\n\n\"Will you kindly advise me in this difficulty? I will come to you at\nLincoln's Inn at any time this afternoon or to-morrow which you may\nappoint. My next few hours are engaged. As soon as this letter is\ndispatched, I am going to Kensington, with the object of ascertaining\nwhether certain doubts I feel about the means by which Mrs. Lecount may\nhave accomplished her discovery are well founded or not. If you will let\nme have your answer by return of post, I will not fail to get back\nto St. John's Wood in time to receive it. Believe me, dear sir, yours\nsincerely,\n\n\"MAGDALEN VANSTONE.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n_From Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn, November 5th.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--Your letter and its inclosure have caused me great concern\nand surprise. Pressure of business allows me no hope of being able\nto see you either to-day or to-morrow morning. But if three o'clock\nto-morrow afternoon will suit you, at that hour you will find me at your\nservice.\n\n\"I cannot pretend to offer a positive opinion until I know more of\nthe particulars connected with this extraordinary business than I find\ncommunicated either in your letter or in your maid's. But with this\nreserve, I venture to suggest that your remaining in London until\nto-morrow may possibly lead to other results besides your consultation\nat my chambers. There is at least a chance that you or I may hear\nsomething further in this strange matter by the morning's post. I\nremain, dear madam, faithfully yours,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\"\n\n\nIII.\n\n_From Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Miss Garth._\n\n\"November 5th, Two o'Clock.\n\n\"I have just returned from Westmoreland House--after purposely leaving\nit in secret, and purposely avoiding you under your own roof. You shall\nknow why I came, and why I went away. It is due to my remembrance of old\ntimes not to treat you like a stranger, although I can never again treat\nyou like a friend.\n\n\"I set forth on the third from the North to London. My only object in\ntaking this long journey was to see Norah. I had been suffering for many\nweary weeks past such remorse as only miserable women like me can feel.\nPerhaps the suffering weakened me; perhaps it roused some old forgotten\ntenderness--God knows!--I can't explain it; I can only tell you that I\nbegan to think of Norah by day, and to dream of Norah by night, till I\nwas almost heartbroken. I have no better reason than this to give for\nrunning all the risks which I ran, and coming to London to see her. I\ndon't wish to claim more for myself than I deserve; I don't wish to\ntell you I was the reformed and repenting creature whom _you_ might have\napproved. I had only one feeling in me that I know of. I wanted to\nput my arms round Norah's neck, and cry my heart out on Norah's bosom.\nChildish enough, I dare say. Something might have come of it; nothing\nmight have come of it--who knows?\n\n\"I had no means of finding Norah without your assistance. However you\nmight disapprove of what I had done, I thought you would not refuse to\nhelp me to find my sister. When I lay down last night in my strange bed,\nI said to myself, 'I will ask Miss Garth, for my father's sake and my\nmother's sake, to tell me.' You don't know what a comfort I felt in that\nthought. How should you? What do good women like you know of miserable\nsinners like me? All you know is that you pray for us at church.\n\n\"Well, I fell asleep happily that night--for the first time since my\nmarriage. When the morning came, I paid the penalty of daring to be\nhappy only for one night. When the morning came, a letter came with\nit, which told me that my bitterest enemy on earth (you have meddled\nsufficiently with my affairs to know what enemy I mean) had revenged\nherself on me in my absence. In following the impulse which led me to my\nsister, I had gone to my ruin.\n\n\"The mischief was beyond all present remedy, when I received the news of\nit. Whatever had happened, whatever might happen, I made up my mind to\npersist in my resolution of seeing Norah before I did anything else. I\nsuspected _you_ of being concerned in the disaster which had overtaken\nme--because I felt positively certain at Aldborough that you and Mrs.\nLecount had written to each other. But I never suspected Norah. If I\nlay on my death-bed at this moment I could say with a safe conscience I\nnever suspected Norah.\n\n\"So I went this morning to Westmor eland House to ask you for my\nsister's address, and to acknowledge plainly that I suspected you of\nbeing again in correspondence with Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\"When I inquired for you at the door, they told me you had gone out, but\nthat you were expected back before long. They asked me if I would see\nyour sister, who was then in the school-room. I desired that your sister\nshould on no account be disturbed: my business was not with her, but\nwith you. I begged to be allowed to wait in a room by myself until you\nreturned.\n\n\"They showed me into the double room on the ground-floor, divided by\ncurtains--as it was when I last remember it. There was a fire in the\nouter division of the room, but none in the inner; and for that reason,\nI suppose, the curtains were drawn. The servant was very civil and\nattentive to me. I have learned to be thankful for civility and\nattention, and I spoke to her as cheerfully as I could. I said to her,\n'I shall see Miss Garth here, as she comes up to the door, and I can\nbeckon her in through the long window.' The servant said I could do so,\nif you came that way, but that you let yourself in sometimes with your\nown key by the back-garden gate; and if you did this, she would take\ncare to let you know of my visit. I mention these trifles, to show you\nthat there was no pre-meditated deceit in my mind when I came to the\nhouse.\n\n\"I waited a weary time, and you never came: I don't know whether my\nimpatience made me think so, or whether the large fire burning made the\nroom really as hot as I felt it to be--I only know that, after a while,\nI passed through the curtains into the inner room, to try the cooler\natmosphere.\n\n\"I walked to the long window which leads into the back garden, to look\nout, and almost at the same time I heard the door opened--the door of\nthe room I had just left, and your voice and the voice of some\nother woman, a stranger to me, talking. The stranger was one of the\nparlor-boarders, I dare say. I gathered from the first words you\nexchanged together, that you had met in the passage--she on her way\ndownstairs, and you on your way in from the back garden. Her next\nquestion and your next answer informed me that this person was a friend\nof my sister's, who felt a strong interest in her, and who knew that\nyou had just returned from a visit to Norah. So far, I only hesitated\nto show myself, because I shrank, in my painful situation, from facing\na stranger. But when I heard my own name immediately afterward on your\nlips and on hers, then I purposely came nearer to the curtain between\nus, and purposely listened.\n\n\"A mean action, you will say? Call it mean, if you like. What better can\nyou expect from such a woman as I am?\n\n\"You were always famous for your memory. There is no necessity for my\nrepeating the words you spoke to your friend, and the words your friend\nspoke to you, hardly an hour since. When you read these lines, you\nwill know, as well as I know, what those words told me. I ask for no\nparticulars; I will take all your reasons and all your excuses for\ngranted. It is enough for me to know that you and Mr. Pendril have been\nsearching for me again, and that Norah is in the conspiracy this time,\nto reclaim me in spite of myself. It is enough for me to know that my\nletter to my sister has been turned into a trap to catch me, and\nthat Mrs. Lecount's revenge has accomplished its object by means of\ninformation received from Norah's lips.\n\n\"Shall I tell you what I suffered when I heard these things? No; it\nwould only be a waste of time to tell you. Whatever I suffer, I deserve\nit--don't I?\n\n\"I waited in that inner room--knowing my own violent temper, and not\ntrusting myself to see you, after what I had heard--I waited in that\ninner room, trembling lest the servant should tell you of my visit\nbefore I could find an opportunity of leaving the house. No such\nmisfortune happened. The servant, no doubt, heard the voices upstairs,\nand supposed that we had met each other in the passage. I don't know how\nlong or how short a time it was before you left the room to go and take\noff your bonnet--you went, and your friend went with you. I raised the\nlong window softly, and stepped into the back garden. The way by which\nyou returned to the house was the way by which I left it. No blame\nattaches to the servant. As usual, where I am concerned, nobody is to\nblame but me.\n\n\"Time enough has passed now to quiet my mind a little. You know how\nstrong I am? You remember how I used to fight against all my illnesses\nwhen I was a child? Now I am a woman, I fight against my miseries in the\nsame way. Don't pity me, Miss Garth! Don't pity me!\n\n\"I have no harsh feeling against Norah. The hope I had of seeing her\nis a hope taken from me; the consolation I had in writing to her is a\nconsolation denied me for the future. I am cut to the heart; but I have\nno angry feeling toward my sister. She means well, poor soul--I dare say\nshe means well. It would distress her, if she knew what has happened.\nDon't tell her. Conceal my visit, and burn my letter.\n\n\"A last word to yourself and I have done:\n\n\"If I rightly understand my present situation, your spies are still\nsearching for me to just as little purpose as they searched at\nYork. Dismiss them--you are wasting your money to no purpose. If you\ndiscovered me to-morrow, what could you do? My position has altered. I\nam no longer the poor outcast girl, the vagabond public performer, whom\nyou once hunted after. I have done what I told you I would do--I have\nmade the general sense of propriety my accomplice this time. Do you know\nwho I am? I am a respectable married woman, accountable for my actions\nto nobody under heaven but my husband. I have got a place in the world,\nand a name in the world, at last. Even the law, which is the friend of\nall you respectable people, has recognized my existence, and has become\n_my_ friend too! The Archbishop of Canterbury gave me his license to be\nmarried, and the vicar of Aldborough performed the service. If I\nfound your spies following me in the street, and if I chose to claim\nprotection from them, the law would acknowledge my claim. You forget\nwhat wonders my wickedness has done for me. It has made Nobody's Child\nSomebody's Wife.\n\n\"If you will give these considerations their due weight; if you will\nexert your excellent common sense, I have no fear of being obliged to\nappeal to my newly-found friend and protector--the law. You will feel,\nby this time, that you have meddled with me at last to some purpose. I\nam estranged from Norah--I am discovered by my husband--I am defeated\nby Mrs. Lecount. You have driven me to the last extremity; you have\nstrengthened me to fight the battle of my life with the resolution which\nonly a lost and friendless woman can feel. Badly as your schemes have\nprospered, they have not proved totally useless after all!\n\n\"I have no more to say. If you ever speak about me to Norah, tell her\nthat a day may come when she will see me again--the day when we two\nsisters have recovered our natural rights; the day when I put Norah's\nfortune into Norah's hand.\n\n\"Those are my last words. Remember them the next time you feel tempted\nto meddle with me again.\n\n\"MAGDALEN VANSTONE.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\n_From Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn, November 6th.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--This morning's post has doubtless brought you the same\nshocking news which it has brought to me. You must know by this time\nthat a terrible affliction has befallen you--the affliction of your\nhusband's sudden death.\n\n\"I am on the point of starting for the North, to make all needful\ninquiries, and to perform whatever duties I may with propriety\nundertake, as solicitor to the deceased gentleman. Let me earnestly\nrecommend you not to follow me to Baliol Cottage, until I have had time\nto write to you first, and to give you such advice as I cannot, through\nignorance of all the circumstances, pretend to offer now. You may rely\non my writing, after my arrival in Scot-land, by the first post. I\nremain, dear madam, faithfully yours,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\"\n\n\nV.\n\n_From Mr. Pendril to Miss Garth._\n\n\"Serle Street, November 6th.\n\n\"DEAR MISS GARTH--I return you Mrs. Noel Vanstone's letter. I can\nunderstand your mortification at the tone in which it is written, and\nyour distress at the manner in which this unhappy woman has interpreted\nthe conversation that she overheard at your house. I cannot honestly add\nthat I lament what has happened. My opinion has never altered since the\nCombe-Raven time. I believe Mrs. Noel Vanstone to be one of the most\nreckless, desperate, and perverted women living; and any circumstances\nthat estrange her from her sister are circumstances which I welcome, for\nher sister's sake.\n\n\"There cannot be a moment's doubt on the course you ought to follow in\nthis matter. Even Mrs. Noel Vanstone herself acknowledges the propriety\nof sparing her sister additional and unnecessary distress. By all means,\nkeep Miss Vanstone in ignorance of the visit to Kensington, and of\nthe letter which has followed it. It would be not only unwise, but\nabsolutely cruel, to enlighten her. If we had any remedy to apply, or\neven any hope to offer, we might feel some hesitation in keeping our\nsecret. But there is no remedy, and no hope. Mrs. Noel Vanstone is\nperfectly justified in the view she takes of her own position. Neither\nyou nor I can assert the smallest right to control her.\n\n\"I have already taken the necessary measures for putting an end to our\nuseless inquiries. In a few days I will write to Miss Vanstone, and will\ndo my best to tranquilize her mind on the subject of her sister. If\nI can find no sufficient excuse to satisfy her, it will be better she\nshould think we have discovered nothing than that she should know the\ntruth. Believe me most truly yours,\n\n\"WILLIAM PENDRIL.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\n_From Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn, November 15th.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--In compliance with your request, I now proceed to\ncommunicate to you in writing what (but for the calamity which has so\nrecently befallen you) I should have preferred communicating by word\nof mouth. Be pleased to consider this letter as strictly confidential\nbetween yourself and me.\n\n\"I inclose, as you desire, a copy of the Will executed by your late\nhusband on the third of this month. There can be no question of the\ngenuineness of the original document. I protested, as a matter of form,\nagainst Admiral Bartram's solicitor assuming a position of authority at\nBaliol Cottage. But he took the position, nevertheless; acting as legal\nrepresentative of the sole Executor under the second Will. I am bound to\nsay I should have done the same myself in his place.\n\n\"The serious question follows, What can we do for the best in your\ninterests? The Will executed under my professional superintendence, on\nthe thirtieth of September last, is at present superseded and revoked\nby the second and later Will, executed on the third of November. Can we\ndispute this document?\n\n\"I doubt the possibility of disputing the new Will on the face of it.\nIt is no doubt irregularly expressed; but it is dated, signed,\nand witnessed as the law directs; and the perfectly simple and\nstraightforward provisions that it contains are in no respect, that I\ncan see, technically open to attack.\n\n\"This being the case, can we dispute the Will on the ground that it has\nbeen executed when the Testator was not in a fit state to dispose of his\nown property? or when the Testator was subjected to undue and improper\ninfluence?\n\n\"In the first of these cases, the medical evidence would put an obstacle\nin our way. We cannot assert that previous illness had weakened the\nTestator's mind. It is clear that he died suddenly, as the doctors had\nall along declared he would die, of disease of the heart. He was out\nwalking in his garden, as usual, on the day of his death; he ate a\nhearty dinner; none of the persons in his service noticed any change in\nhim; he was a little more irritable with them than usual, but that was\nall. It is impossible to attack the state of his faculties: there is no\ncase to go into court with, so far.\n\n\"Can we declare that he acted under undue influence; or, in plainer\nterms, under the influence of Mrs. Lecount?\n\n\"There are serious difficulties, again, in the way of taking this\ncourse. We cannot assert, for example, that Mrs. Lecount has assumed\na place in the will which she has no fair claim to occupy. She has\ncunningly limited her own legacy, not only to what is fairly due her,\nbut to what the late Mr. Michael Vanstone himself had the intention of\nleaving her. If I were examined on the subject, I should be compelled\nto acknowledge that I had heard him express this intention myself. It is\nonly the truth to say that I have heard him express it more than once.\nThere is no point of attack in Mrs. Lecount's legacy, and there is no\npoint of attack in your late husband's choice of an executor. He\nhas made the wise choice, and the natural choice, of the oldest and\ntrustiest friend he had in the world.\n\n\"One more consideration remains--the most important which I have yet\napproached, and therefore the consideration which I have reserved to\nthe last. On the thirtieth of September, the Testator executes a will,\nleaving his widow sole executrix, with a legacy of eighty thousand\npounds. On the third of November following, he expressly revokes this\nwill, and leaves another in its stead, in which his widow is never once\nmentioned, and in which the whole residue of his estate, after payment\nof one comparatively trifling legacy, is left to a friend.\n\n\"It rests entirely with you to say whether any valid reason can or can\nnot be produced to explain such an extraordinary proceeding as this. If\nno reason can be assigned--and I know of none myself--I think we have\na point here which deserves our careful consideration; for it may be a\npoint which is open to attack. Pray understand that I am now appealing\nto you solely as a lawyer, who is obliged to look all possible\neventualities in the face. I have no wish to intrude on your private\naffairs; I have no wish to write a word which could be construed into\nany indirect reflection on yourself.\n\n\"If you tell me that, so far as you know, your husband capriciously\nstruck you out of his will, without assignable reason or motive for\ndoing so, and without other obvious explanation of his conduct than that\nhe acted in this matter entirely under the influence of Mrs. Lecount,\nI will immediately take Counsel's opinion touching the propriety of\ndisputing the will on this ground. If, on the other hand, you tell me\nthat there are reasons (known to yourself, though unknown to me) for\nnot taking the course I propose, I will accept that intimation without\ntroubling you, unless you wish it, to explain yourself further. In this\nlatter event, I will write to you again; for I shall then have something\nmore to say, which may greatly surprise you, on the subject of the Will.\n\n\"Faithfully yours,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\"\n\n\nVII.\n\n_From Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Mr. Loscombe._\n\n\"November 16th.\n\n\"DEAR SIR--Accept my best thanks for the kindness and consideration with\nwhich you have treated me; and let the anxieties under which I am now\nsuffering plead my excuse, if I reply to your letter without ceremony,\nin the fewest possible words.\n\n\"I have my own reasons for not hesitating to answer your question in the\nnegative. It is impossible for us to go to law, as you propose, on the\nsubject of the Will.\n\n\"Believe me, dear sir, yours gratefully,\n\n\"MAGDALEN VANSTONE.\"\n\n\nVIII.\n\n_From Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn. November 17th.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, answering\nmy proposal in the negative, for reasons of your own. Under these\ncircumstances--on which I offer no comment--I beg to perform my promise\nof again communicating with you on the subject of your late husband's\nWill.\n\n\"Be so kind as to look at your copy of the document. You will find that\nthe clause which devises the whole residue of your husband's estate to\nAdmiral Bartram ends in these terms: _to be by him applied to such uses\nas he may think fit._\n\n\"Simple as they may seem to you, these are very remarkable words. In the\nfirst place, no practical lawyer would have used them in drawing your\nhusband's will. In the second place, they are utterly useless to serve\nany plain straightforward purpose. The legacy is left unconditionally\nto the admiral; and in the same breath he is told that he may do what he\nlikes with it! The phrase points clearly to one of two conclusions. It\nhas either dropped from the writer's pen in pure ignorance, or it has\nbeen carefully set where it appears to serve the purpose of a snare. I\nam firmly persuaded that the latter explanation is the right one. The\nwords are expressly intended to mislead some person--yourself in all\nprobability--and the cunning which has put them to that use is a cunning\nwhich (as constantly happens when uninstructed persons meddle with law)\nhas overreached itself. My thirty years' experience reads those words in\na sense exactly opposite to the sense which they are intended to convey.\nI say that Admiral Bartram is _not_ free to apply his legacy to such\npurposes as he may think fit; I believe he is privately controlled by a\nsupplementary document in the shape of a Secret Trust.\n\n\"I can easily explain to you what I mean by a Secret Trust. It is\nusually contained in the form of a letter from a Testator to his\nExecutors, privately informing them of testamentary intentions on his\npart which he has not thought proper openly to acknowledge in his will.\nI leave you a hundred pounds; and I write a private letter enjoining\nyou, on taking the legacy, not to devote it to your own purposes, but to\ngive it to some third person, whose name I have my own reasons for not\nmentioning in my will. That is a Secret Trust.\n\n\"If I am right in my own persuasion that such a document as I here\ndescribe is at this moment in Admiral Bartram's possession--a\npersuasion based, in the first instance, on the extraordinary words\nthat I have quoted to you; and, in the second instance, on purely legal\nconsiderations with which it is needless to incumber my letter--if I am\nright in this opinion, the discovery of the Secret Trust would be, in\nall probability, a most important discovery to your interests. I\nwill not trouble you with technical reasons, or with references to\nmy experience in these matters, which only a professional man could\nunderstand. I will merely say that I don't give up your cause as utterly\nlost, until the conviction now impressed on my own mind is proved to be\nwrong.\n\n\"I can add no more, while this important question still remains involved\nin doubt; neither can I suggest any means of solving that doubt. If the\nexistence of the Trust was proved, and if the nature of the stipulations\ncontained in it was made known to me, I could then say positively\nwhat the legal chances were of your being able to set up a Case on the\nstrength of it: and I could also tell you whether I should or should\nnot feel justified in personally undertaking that Case under a private\narrangement with yourself.\n\n\"As things are, I can make no arrangement, and offer no advice. I can\nonly put you confidentially in possession of my private opinion, leaving\nyou entirely free to draw your own inferences from it, and regretting\nthat I cannot write more confidently and more definitely than I\nhave written here. All that I could conscientiously say on this very\ndifficult and delicate subject, I have said.\n\n\"Believe me, dear madam, faithfully yours,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\n\n\"P.S.--I omitted one consideration in my last letter, which I may\nmention here, in order to show you that no point in connection with the\ncase has escaped me. If it had been possible to show that Mr. Vanstone\nwas _domiciled_ in Scotland at the time of his death, we might have\nasserted your interests by means of the Scotch law, which does not allow\na husband the power of absolutely disinheriting his wife. But it\nis impossible to assert that Mr. Vanstone was legally domiciled in\nScotland. He came there as a visitor only; he occupied a furnished house\nfor the season; and he never expressed, either by word or deed, the\nslightest intention of settling permanently in the North.\"\n\n\nIX.\n\n_From Mrs. Noel Vanstone to Mr. Loscombe._\n\n\"DEAR SIR--I have read your letter more than once, with the deepest\ninterest and attention; and the oftener I read it, the more firmly I\nbelieve that there is really such a Letter as you mention in Admiral\nBartram's hands.\n\n\"It is my interest that the discovery should be made, and I at once\nacknowledge to you that I am determined to find the means of secretly\nand certainly making it. My resolution rests on other motives than the\nmotives which you might naturally suppose would influence me. I only\ntell you this, in case you feel inclined to remonstrate. There is good\nreason for what I say, when I assure you that remonstrance will be\nuseless.\n\n\"I ask for no assistance in this matter; I will trouble nobody for\nadvice. You shall not be involved in any rash proceedings on my part.\nWhatever danger there may be, I will risk it. Whatever delays may\nhappen, I will bear them patiently. I am lonely and friendless, and\nsurely troubled in mind, but I am strong enough to win my way through\nworse trials than these. My spirits will rise again, and my time will\ncome. If that Secret Trust is in Admiral Bartram's possession--when you\nnext see me, you shall see me with it in my own hands. Yours gratefully,\n\n\"MAGDALEN VANSTONE.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SIXTH SCENE.\n\nST. JOHN'S WOOD.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nIT wanted little more than a fortnight to Christmas; but the weather\nshowed no signs yet of the frost and snow, conventionally associated\nwith the coming season. The atmosphere was unnaturally warm, and the old\nyear was dying feebly in sapping rain and enervating mist.\n\nToward the close of the December afternoon, Magdalen sat alone in the\nlodging which she had occupied since her arrival in London. The fire\nburned sluggishly in the narrow little grate; the view of the wet houses\nand soaking gardens opposite was darkening fast; and the bell of the\nsuburban muffin-boy tinkled in the distance drearily. Sitting close over\nthe fire, with a little money lying loose in her lap, Magdalen absently\nshifted the coins to and fro on the smooth surface of her dress,\nincessantly altering their positions toward each other, as if they were\npieces of a \"child's puzzle\" which she was trying to put together.\nThe dim fire-light flaming up on her faintly from time to time showed\nchanges which would have told their own tale sadly to friends of former\ndays. Her dress had become loose through the wasting of her figure; but\nshe had not cared to alter it. The old restlessness in her movements,\nthe old mobility in her expression, appeared no more. Her face passively\nmaintained its haggard composure, its changeless unnatural calm. Mr.\nPendril might have softened his hard sentence on her, if he had seen\nher now; and Mrs. Lecount, in the plenitude of her triumph, might have\npitied her fallen enemy at last.\n\nHardly four months had passed since the wedding-day at Aldborough, and\nthe penalty for that day was paid already--paid in unavailing remorse,\nin hopeless isolation, in irremediable defeat! Let this be said for her;\nlet the truth which has been told of the fault be told of the expiation\nas well. Let it be recorded of her that she enjoyed no secret triumph on\nthe day of her success. The horror of herself with which her own act had\ninspired her, had risen to its climax when the design of her marriage\nwas achieved. She had never suffered in secret as she suffered when the\nCombe-Raven money was left to her in her husband's will. She had never\nfelt the means taken to accomplish her end so unutterably degrading to\nherself, as she felt them on the day when the end was reached. Out of\nthat feeling had grown the remorse which had hurried her to seek pardon\nand consolation in her sister's love. Never since it had first entered\nher heart, never since she had first felt it sacred to her at her\nfather's grave, had the Purpose to which she had vowed herself, so\nnearly lost its hold on her as at this time. Never might Norah's\ninfluence have achieved such good as on the day when that influence was\nlost--the day when the fatal words were overheard at Miss Garth's--the\nday when the fatal letter from Scotland told of Mrs. Lecount's revenge.\n\nThe harm was done; the chance was gone. Time and Hope alike had both\npassed her by.\n\nFaintly and more faintly the inner voices now pleaded with her to pause\non the downward way. The discovery which had poisoned her heart with its\nfirst distrust of her sister; the tidings which had followed it of her\nhusband's death; the sting of Mrs. Lecount's triumph, felt through all,\nhad done their work. The remorse which had embittered her married\nlife was deadened now to a dull despair. It was too late to make the\natonement of confession--too late to lay bare to the miserable husband\nthe deeper secrets that had once lurked in the heart of the miserable\nwife. Innocent of all thought of the hideous treachery which Mrs.\nLecount had imputed to her--she was guilty of knowing how his health\nwas broken when she married him; guilty of knowing, when he left her the\nCombe-Raven money, that the accident of a moment, harmless to other men,\nmight place his life in jeopardy, and effect her release. His death\nhad told her this--had told her plainly what she had shrunk, in his\nlifetime, from openly acknowledging to herself. From the dull torment of\nthat reproach; from the dreary wretchedness of doubting everybody, even\nto Norah herself; from the bitter sense of her defeated schemes; from\nthe blank solitude of her friendless life--what refuge was left? But one\nrefuge now. She turned to the relentless Purpose which was hurrying her\nto her ruin, and cried to it with the daring of her despair--Drive me\non!\n\nFor days and days together she had bent her mind on the one object which\noccupied it since she had received the lawyer's letter. For days\nand days together she had toiled to meet the first necessity of her\nposition--to find a means of discovering the Secret Trust. There was no\nhope, this time, of assistance from Captain Wragge. Long practice had\nmade the old militia-man an adept in the art of vanishing. The plow of\nthe moral agriculturist left no furrows--not a trace of him was to be\nfound! Mr. Loscombe was too cautious to commit himself to an active\ncourse of any kind; he passively maintained his opinions and left the\nrest to his client---he desired to know nothing until the Trust was\nplaced in his hands. Magdalen's interests were now in Magdalen's own\nsole care. Risk or no risk, what she did next she must do by herself.\n\nThe prospect had not daunted her. Alone she had calculated the chances\nthat might be tried. Alone she was now determined to make the attempt.\n\n\"The time has come,\" she said to herself, as she sat over the fire. \"I\nmust sound Louisa first.\"\n\nShe collected the scattered coins in her lap, and placed them in a\nlittle heap on the table, then rose and rang the bell. The landlady\nanswered it.\n\n\"Is my servant downstairs?\" inquired Magdalen.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. She is having her tea.\"\n\n\"When she has done, say I want her up here. Wait a moment. You will find\nyour money on the table--the money I owe you for last week. Can you find\nit? or would you like to have a candle?\"\n\n\"It's rather dark, ma'am.\"\n\nMagdalen lit a candle. \"What notice must I give you,\" she asked, as she\nput the candle on the table, \"before I leave?\"\n\n\"A week is the usual notice, ma'am. I hope you have no objection to make\nto the house?\"\n\n\"None whatever. I only ask the question, because I may be obliged to\nleave these lodgings rather sooner than I anticipated. Is the money\nright?\"\n\n\"Quite right, ma'am. Here is your receipt.\"\n\n\"Thank you. Don't forget to send Louisa to me as soon as she has done\nher tea.\"\n\nThe landlady withdrew. As soon as she was alone again, Magdalen\nextinguished the candle, and drew an empty chair close to her own chair\non the hearth. This done, she resumed her former place, and waited\nuntil Louisa appeared. There was doubt in her face as she sat looking\nmechanically into the fire. \"A poor chance,\" she thought to herself;\n\"but, poor as it is, a chance that I must try.\"\n\nIn ten minutes more, Louisa's meek knock was softly audible outside. She\nwas surprised, on entering the room, to find no other light in it than\nthe light of the fire.\n\n\"Will you have the candles, ma'am?\" she inquired, respectfully.\n\n\"We will have candles if you wish for them yourself,\" replied Magdalen;\n\"not otherwise. I have something to say to you. When I have said it, you\nshall decide whether we sit together in the dark or in the light.\"\n\nLouisa waited near the door, and listened to those strange words in\nsilent astonishment.\n\n\"Come here,\" said Magdalen, pointing to the empty chair; \"come here and\nsit down.\"\n\nLouisa advanced, and timidly removed the chair from its position at her\nmistress's side. Magdalen instantly drew it back again. \"No!\" she said.\n\"Come closer--come close by me.\" After a moment's hesitation, Louisa\nobeyed.\n\n\"I ask you to sit near me,\" pursued Magdalen, \"because I wish to speak\nto you on equal terms. Whatever distinctions there might once have been\nbetween us are now at an end. I am a lonely woman thrown helpless on my\nown resources, without rank or place in the world. I may or may not keep\nyou as my friend. As mistress and maid the connection between us must\ncome to an end.\"\n\n\"Oh, ma'am, don't, don't say that!\" pleaded Louisa, faintly.\n\nMagdalen sorrowfully and steadily went on.\n\n\"When you first came to me,\" she resumed, \"I thought I should not like\nyou. I have learned to like you--I have learned to be grateful to you.\nFrom first to last you have been faithful and good to me. The least I\ncan do in return is not to stand in the way of your future prospects.\"\n\n\"Don't send me away, ma'am!\" said Louisa, imploringly. \"If you can only\nhelp me with a little money now and then, I'll wait for my wages--I\nwill, indeed.\"\n\nMagdalen took her hand and went on, as sorrowfully and as steadily as\nbefore.\n\n\"My future life is all darkness, all uncertainty,\" she said. \"The next\nstep I may take may lead me to my prosperity or may lead me to my ruin.\nCan I ask you to share such a prospect as this? If your future was as\nuncertain as mine is--if you, too, were a friendless woman thrown on\nthe world--my conscience might be easy in letting you cast your lot\nwith mine. I might accept your attachment, for I might feel I was not\nwronging you. How can I feel this in your case? You have a future to\nlook to. You are an excellent servant; you can get another place--a far\nbetter place than mine. You can refer to me; and if the character I give\nis not considered sufficient, you can refer to the mistress you served\nbefore me--\"\n\nAt the instant when that reference to the girl's last employer\nescaped Magdalen's lips, Louisa snatched her hand away and started up\naffrightedly from her chair. There was a moment's silence. Both mistress\nand maid were equally taken by surprise.\n\nMagdalen was the first to recover herself.\n\n\"Is it getting too dark?\" she asked, significantly. \"Are you going to\nlight the candles, after all?\"\n\nLouisa drew back into the dimmest corner of the room.\n\n\"You suspect me, ma'am!\" she answered out of the darkness, in a\nbreathless whisper. \"Who has told you? How did you find out--?\" She\nstopped, and burst into tears. \"I deserve your suspicion,\" she said,\nstruggling to compose herself. \"I can't deny it to _you_. You have\ntreated me so kindly; you have made me so fond of you! Forgive me, Mrs.\nVanstone--I am a wretch; I have deceived you.\"\n\n\"Come here and sit down by me again,\" said Magdalen. \"Come--or I will\nget up myself and bring you back.\"\n\nLouisa slowly returned to her place. Dim as the fire-light was, she\nseemed to fear it. She held her handkerchief over her face, and shrank\nfrom her mistress as she seated herself again in the chair.\n\n\"You are wrong in thinking that any one has betrayed you to me,\" said\nMagdalen. \"All that I know of you is, what your own looks and ways have\ntold me. You have had some secret trouble weighing on your mind ever\nsince you have been in my service. I confess I have spoken with the\nwish to find out more of you and your past life than I have found out\nyet--not because I am curious, but because I have my secret troubles\ntoo. Are you an unhappy woman, like me? If you are, I will take you into\nmy confidence. If you have nothing to tell me--if you choose to keep\nyour secret--I don't blame you; I only say, Let us part. I won't ask how\nyou have deceived me. I will only remember that you have been an honest\nand faithful and competent servant while I have employed you; and I will\nsay as much in your favor to any new mistress you like to send to me.\"\n\nShe waited for the reply. For a moment, and only for a moment, Louisa\nhesitated. The girl's nature was weak, but not depraved. She was\nhonestly attached to her mistress; and she spoke with a courage which\nMagdalen had not expected from her.\n\n\"If you send me away, ma'am,\" she said, \"I won't take my character from\nyou till I have told you the truth; I won't return your kindness by\ndeceiving you a second time. Did my master ever tell you how he engaged\nme?\"\n\n\"No. I never asked him, and he never told me.\"\n\n\"He engaged me, ma'am, with a written character--\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"The character was a false one.\"\n\nMagdalen drew back in amazement. The confession she heard was not the\nconfession she had anticipated.\n\n\"Did your mistress refuse to give you a character?\" she asked. \"Why?\"\n\nLouisa dropped on her knees and hid her face in her mistress's lap.\n\"Don't ask me!\" she said. \"I'm a miserable, degraded creature; I'm\nnot fit to be in the same room with you!\" Magdalen bent over her, and\nwhispered a question in her ear. Louisa whispered back the one sad word\nof reply.\n\n\"Has he deserted you?\" asked Magdalen, after waiting a moment, and\nthinking first.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Do you love him?\"\n\n\"Dearly.\"\n\nThe remembrance of her own loveless marriage stung Magdalen to the\nquick.\n\n\"For God's sake, don't kneel to _me!_\" she cried, passionately. \"If\nthere is a degraded woman in this room, I am the woman--not you!\"\n\nShe raised the girl by main force from her knees, and put her back in\nthe chair. They both waited a little in silence. Keeping her hand\non Louisa's shoulder, Magdalen seated herself again, and looked with\nunutterable bitterness of sorrow into the dying fire. \"Oh,\" she thought,\n\"what happy women there are in the world! Wives who love their husbands!\nMothers who are not ashamed to own their children! Are you quieter?\" she\nasked, gently addressing Louisa once more. \"Can you answer me, if I ask\nyou something else? Where is the child?\"\n\n\"The child is out at nurse.\"\n\n\"Does the father help to support it?\"\n\n\"He does all he can, ma'am.\"\n\n\"What is he? Is he in service? Is he in a trade?\"\n\n\"His father is a master-carpenter--he works in his father's yard.\"\n\n\"If he has got work, why has he not married you?\"\n\n\"It is his father's fault, ma'am--not his. His father has no pity on us.\nHe would be turned out of house and home if he married me.\"\n\n\"Can he get no work elsewhere?\"\n\n\"It's hard to get good work in London, ma'am. There are so many in\nLondon--they take the bread out of each other's mouths. If we had only\nhad the money to emigrate, he would have married me long since.\"\n\n\"Would he marry you if you had the money now?\"\n\n\"I am sure he would, ma'am. He could get plenty of work in Australia,\nand double and treble the wages he gets here. He is trying hard, and\nI am trying hard, to save a little toward it--I put by all I can spare\nfrom my child. But it is so little! If we live for years to come, there\nseems no hope for us. I know I have done wrong every way--I know I don't\ndeserve to be happy. But how could I let my child suffer?--I was obliged\nto go to service. My mistress was hard on me, and my health broke down\nin trying to live by my needle. I would never have deceived anybody by\na false character, if there had been another chance for me. I was alone\nand helpless, ma'am; and I can only ask you to forgive me.\"\n\n\"Ask better women than I am,\" said Magdalen, sadly. \"I am only fit to\nfeel for you, and I do feel for you with all my heart. In your place I\nshould have gone into service with a false character, too. Say no more\nof the past--you don't know how you hurt me in speaking of it. Talk of\nthe future. I think I can help you, and do you no harm. I think you can\nhelp me, and do me the greatest of all services in return. Wait, and you\nshall hear what I mean. Suppose you were married--how much would it cost\nfor you and your husband to emigrate?\"\n\nLouisa mentioned the cost of a steerage passage to Australia for a man\nand his wife. She spoke in low, hopeless tones. Moderate as the sum was,\nit looked like unattainable wealth in her eyes.\n\nMagdalen started in her chair, and took the girl's hand once more.\n\n\"Louisa!\" she said, earnestly; \"if I gave you the money, what would you\ndo for me in return?\"\n\nThe proposal seemed to strike Louisa speechless with astonishment. She\ntrembled violently, and said nothing. Magdalen repeated her words.\n\n\"Oh, ma'am, do you mean it?\" said the girl. \"Do you really mean it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Magdalen; \"I really mean it. What would you do for me in\nreturn?\"\n\n\"Do?\" repeated Louisa. \"Oh what is there I would _not_ do!\" She tried\nto kiss her mistress's hand; but Magdalen would not permit it. She\nresolutely, almost roughly, drew her hand away.\n\n\"I am laying you under no obligation,\" she said. \"We are serving each\nother--that is all. Sit quiet, and let me think.\"\n\nFor the next ten minutes there was silence in the room. At the end of\nthat time Magdalen took out her watch and held it close to the grate.\nThere was just firelight enough to show her the hour. It was close on\nsix o'clock.\n\n\"Are you composed enough to go downstairs and deliver a message?\" she\nasked, rising from her chair as she spoke to Louisa again. \"It is a very\nsimple message--it is only to tell the boy that I want a cab as soon as\nhe can get me one. I must go out immediately. You shall know why later\nin the evening. I have much more to say to you; but there is no time\nto say it now. When I am gone, bring your work up here, and wait for my\nreturn. I shall be back before bed-time.\"\n\nWithout another word of explanation, she hurriedly lit a candle and\nwithdrew into the bedroom to put on her bonnet and shawl.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nBETWEEN nine and ten o'clock the same evening, Louisa, waiting\nanxiously, heard the long-expected knock at the house door. She ran\ndownstairs at once and let her mistress in.\n\nMagdalen's face was flushed. She showed far more agitation on returning\nto the house than she had shown on leaving it. \"Keep your place at the\ntable,\" she said to Louisa, impatiently; \"but lay aside your work. I\nwant you to attend carefully to what I am going to say.\"\n\nLouisa obeyed. Magdalen seated herself at the opposite side of the\ntable, and moved the candles, so as to obtain a clear and uninterrupted\nview of her servant's face.\n\n\"Have you noticed a respectable elderly woman,\" she began, abruptly,\n\"who has been here once or twice in the last fortnight to pay me a\nvisit?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am; I think I let her in the second time she came. An elderly\nperson named Mrs. Attwood?\"\n\n\"That is the person I mean. Mrs. Attwood is Mr. Loscombe's housekeeper;\nnot the housekeeper at his private residence, but the housekeeper at his\noffices in Lincoln's Inn. I promised to go and drink tea with her some\nevening this week, and I have been to-night. It is strange of me, is\nit not, to be on these familiar terms with a woman in Mrs. Attwood's\nsituation?\"\n\nLouisa made no answer in words. Her face spoke for her: she could hardly\navoid thinking it strange.\n\n\"I had a motive for making friends with Mrs. Attwood,\" Magdalen went on.\n\"She is a widow, with a large family of daughters. Her daughters are all\nin service. One of them is an under-housemaid in the service of Admiral\nBartram, at St. Crux-in-the-Marsh. I found that out from Mrs. Attwood's\nmaster; and as soon as I arrived at the discovery, I privately\ndetermined to make Mrs. Attwood's acquaintance. Stranger still, is it\nnot?\"\n\nLouisa began to look a little uneasy. Her mistress's manner was at\nvariance with her mistress's words--it was plainly suggestive of\nsomething startling to come.\n\n\"What attraction Mrs. Attwood finds in my society,\" Magdalen continued,\n\"I cannot presume to say. I can only tell you she has seen better days;\nshe is an educated person; and she may like my society on that\naccount. At any rate, she has readily met my advances toward her. What\nattraction I find in this good woman, on my side, is soon told. I have a\ngreat curiosity--an unaccountable curiosity, you will think--about\nthe present course of household affairs at St. Crux-in-the-Marsh. Mrs.\nAttwood's daughter is a good girl, and constantly writes to her mother.\nHer mother is proud of the letters and proud of the girl, and is ready\nenough to talk about her daughter and her daughter's place. That is Mrs.\nAttwood's attraction to _me._ You understand, so far?\"\n\nYes--Louisa understood. Magdalen went on. \"Thanks to Mrs. Attwood and\nMrs. Attwood's daughter,\" she said, \"I know some curious particulars\nalready of the household at St. Crux. Servants' tongues and servants'\nletters--as I need not tell _you_--are oftener occupied with their\nmasters and mistresses than their masters and mistresses suppose.\nThe only mistress at St. Crux is the housekeeper. But there is a\nmaster--Admiral Bartram. He appears to be a strange old man, whose\nwhims and fancies amuse his servants as well as his friends. One of his\nfancies (the only one we need trouble ourselves to notice) is, that he\nhad men enough about him when he was living at sea, and that now he is\nliving on shore, he will be waited on by women-servants alone. The one\nman in the house is an old sailor, who has been all his life with his\nmaster--he is a kind of pensioner at St. Crux, and has little or nothing\nto do with the housework. The other servants, indoors, are all women;\nand instead of a footman to wait on him at dinner, the admiral has a\nparlor-maid. The parlor-maid now at St. Crux is engaged to be married,\nand as soon as her master can suit himself she is going away. These\ndiscoveries I made some days since. But when I saw Mrs. Attwood\nto-night, she had received another letter from her daughter in the\ninterval, and that letter has helped me to find out something more.\nThe housekeeper is at her wits' end to find a new servant. Her master\ninsists on youth and good looks--he leaves everything else to the\nhousekeeper--but he will have that. All the inquiries made in the\nneighborhood have failed to produce the sort of parlor-maid whom the\nadmiral wants. If nothing can be done in the next fortnight or three\nweeks, the housekeeper will advertise in the _Times_, and will come\nto London herself to see the applicants, and to make strict personal\ninquiry into their characters.\"\n\nLouisa looked at her mistress more attentively than ever. The expression\nof perplexity left her face, and a shade of disappointment appeared\nthere in its stead. \"Bear in mind what I have said,\" pursued Magdalen;\n\"and wait a minute more, while I ask you some questions. Don't think you\nunderstand me yet--I can assure you, you don't understand me. Have you\nalways lived in service as lady's maid?\"\n\n\"No, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Have you ever lived as parlor-maid?\"\n\n\"Only in one place, ma'am, and not for long there.\"\n\n\"I suppose you lived long enough to learn your duties?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"What were your duties besides waiting at table?\"\n\n\"I had to show visitors in.\"\n\n\"Yes; and what else?\"\n\n\"I had the plate and the glass to look after; and the table-linen\nwas all under my care. I had to answer all the bells, except in the\nbedrooms. There were other little odds and ends sometimes to do--\"\n\n\"But your regular duties were the duties you have just mentioned?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"How long ago is it since you lived in service as a parlor-maid?\"\n\n\"A little better than two years, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I suppose you have not forgotten how to wait at table, and clean plate,\nand the rest of it, in that time?\"\n\nAt this question Louisa's attention, which had been wandering more\nand more during the progress of Magdalen's inquiries, wandered away\naltogether. Her gathering anxieties got the better of her discretion,\nand even of her timidity. Instead of answering her mistress, she\nsuddenly and confusedly ventured on a question of her own.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" she said. \"Did you mean me to offer for the\nparlor-maid's place at St. Crux?\"\n\n\"You?\" replied Magdalen. \"Certainly not! Have you forgotten what I said\nto you in this room before I went out? I mean you to be married, and go\nto Australia with your husband and your child. You have not waited as\nI told you, to hear me explain myself. You have drawn your own\nconclusions, and you have drawn them wrong. I asked a question just\nnow, which you have not answered--I asked if you had forgotten your\nparlor-maid's duties?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, ma'am!\" Louisa had replied rather unwillingly thus far. She\nanswered readily and confidently now.\n\n\"Could you teach the duties to another servant?\" asked Magdalen.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am--easily, if she was quick and attentive.\"\n\n\"Could you teach the duties to Me?\"\n\nLouisa started, and changed color. \"You, ma'am!\" she exclaimed, half in\nincredulity, half in alarm.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Magdalen. \"Could you qualify me to take the parlor-maid's\nplace at St. Crux?\"\n\nPlain as those words were, the bewilderment which they produced in\nLouisa's mind seemed to render her incapable of comprehending her\nmistress's proposal. \"You, ma'am!\" she repeated, vacantly.\n\n\"I shall perhaps help you to understand this extraordinary project of\nmine,\" said Magdalen, \"if I tell you plainly what the object of it is.\nDo you remember what I said to you about Mr. Vanstone's will when you\ncame here from Scotland to join me?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. You told me you had been left out of the will altogether.\nI'm sure my fellow-servant would never have been one of the witnesses if\nshe had known--\"\n\n\"Never mind that now. I don't blame your fellow-servant--I blame nobody\nbut Mrs. Lecount. Let me go on with what I was saying. It is not at\nall certain that Mrs. Lecount can do me the mischief which Mrs. Lecount\nintended. There is a chance that my lawyer, Mr. Loscombe, may be able to\ngain me what is fairly my due, in spite of the will. The chance turns\non my discovering a letter which Mr. Loscombe believes, and which I\nbelieve, to be kept privately in Admiral Bartram's possession. I have\nnot the least hope of getting at that letter if I make the attempt in my\nown person. Mrs. Lecount has poisoned the admiral's mind against me, and\nMr. Vanstone has given him a secret to keep from me. If I wrote to him,\nhe would not answer my letter. If I went to his house, the door would\nbe closed in my face. I must find my way into St. Crux as a stranger--I\nmust be in a position to look about the house, unsuspected--I must be\nthere with plenty of time on my hands. All the circumstances are in my\nfavor, if I am received into the house as a servant; and as a servant I\nmean to go.\"\n\n\"But you are a lady, ma'am,\" objected Louisa, in the greatest\nperplexity. \"The servants at St. Crux would find you out.\"\n\n\"I am not at all afraid of their finding me out,\" said Magdalen. \"I know\nhow to disguise myself in other people's characters more cleverly than\nyou suppose. Leave me to face the chances of discovery--that is my risk.\nLet us talk of nothing now but what concerns _you._ Don't decide yet\nwhether you will, or will not, give me the help I want. Wait, and hear\nfirst what the help is. You are quick and clever at your needle. Can you\nmake me the sort of gown which it is proper for a servant to wear--and\ncan you alter one of my best silk dresses so as to make it fit yourself\n--in a week's time?\"\n\n\"I think I could get them done in a week, ma'am. But why am I to wear--\"\n\n\"Wait a little, and you will see. I shall give the landlady her week's\nnotice to-morrow. In the interval, while you are making the dresses, I\ncan be learning the parlor-maid's duties. When the house-servant\nhere has brought up the dinner, and when you and I are alone in the\nroom--instead of your waiting on me, as usual, I will wait on you. (I\nam quite serious; don't interrupt me!) Whatever I can learn besides,\nwithout hindering you, I will practice carefully at every opportunity.\nWhen the week is over, and the dresses are done, we will leave this\nplace, and go into other lodgings--you as the mistress and I as the\nmaid.\"\n\n\"I should be found out, ma'am,\" interposed Louisa, trembling at the\nprospect before her. \"I am not a lady.\"\n\n\"And I am,\" said Magdalen, bitterly. \"Shall I tell you what a lady\nis? A lady is a woman who wears a silk gown, and has a sense of her own\nimportance. I shall put the gown on your back, and the sense in\nyour head. You speak good English; you are naturally quiet and\nself-restrained; if you can only conquer your timidity, I have not the\nleast fear of you. There will be time enough in the new lodging for you\nto practice your character, and for me to practice mine. There will be\ntime enough to make some more dresses--another gown for me, and your\nwedding-dress (which I mean to give you) for yourself. I shall have the\nnewspaper sent every day. When the advertisement appears, I shall answer\nit--in any name I can take on the spur of the moment; in your name,\nif you like to lend it to me; and when the housekeeper asks me for my\ncharacter, I shall refer her to you. She will see you in the position\nof mistress, and me in the position of maid--no suspicion can possibly\nenter her mind, unless you put it there. If you only have the courage\nto follow my instructions, and to say what I shall tell you to say, the\ninterview will be over in ten minutes.\"\n\n\"You frighten me, ma'am,\" said Louisa, still trembling. \"You take my\nbreath away with surprise. Courage! Where shall I find courage?\"\n\n\"Where I keep it for you,\" said Magdalen--\"in the passage-money to\nAustralia. Look at the new prospect which gives you a husband, and\nrestores you to your child--and you will find your courage there.\"\n\nLouisa's sad face brightened; Louisa's faint heart beat quick. A spark\nof her mistress's spirit flew up into her eyes as she thought of the\ngolden future.\n\n\"If you accept my proposal,\" pursued Magdalen, \"you can be asked in\nchurch at once, if you like. I promise you the money on the day when the\nadvertisement appears in the newspaper. The risk of the housekeeper's\nrejecting me is my risk--not yours. My good looks are sadly gone off,\nI know. But I think I can still hold my place against the other\nservants--I think I can still _look_ the parlor-maid whom Admiral\nBartram wants. There is nothing for you to fear in this matter; I should\nnot have mentioned it if there had been. The only danger is the danger\nof my being discovered at St. Crux, and that falls entirely on me. By\nthe time I am in the admiral's house you will be married, and the ship\nwill be taking you to your new life.\"\n\nLouisa's face, now brightening with hope, now clouding again with fear,\nshowed plain signs of the struggle which it cost her to decide. She\ntried to gain time; she attempted confusedly to speak a few words of\ngratitude; but her mistress silenced her.\n\n\"You owe me no thanks,\" said Magdalen. \"I tell you again, we are only\nhelping each other. I have very little money, but it is enough for your\npurpose, and I give it you freely. I have led a wretched life; I have\nmade others wretched about me. I can't even make you happy, except by\ntempting you to a new deceit. There! there! it's not your fault. Worse\nwomen than you are will help me, if you refuse. Decide as you like, but\ndon't be afraid of taking the money. If I succeed, I shall not want it.\nIf I fail--\"\n\nShe stopped, rose abruptly from her chair, and hid her face from Louisa\nby walking away to the fire-place.\n\n\"If I fail,\" she resumed, warming her foot carelessly at the fender,\n\"all the money in the world will be of no use to me. Never mind\nwhy--never mind Me--think of yourself. I won't take advantage of the\nconfession you have made to me; I won't influence you against your will.\nDo as you yourself think best. But remember one thing--my mind is made\nup; nothing you can say or do will change it.\"\n\nHer sudden removal from the table, the altered tones of her voice as she\nspoke the last words, appeared to renew Louisa's hesitation. She clasped\nher hands together in her lap, and wrung them hard. \"This has come on me\nvery suddenly, ma'am,\" said the girl. \"I am sorely tempted to say Yes;\nand yet I am almost afraid--\"\n\n\"Take the night to consider it,\" interposed Magdalen, keeping her face\npersistently turned toward the fire; \"and tell me what you have decided\nto do, when you come into my room to-morrow morning. I shall want no\nhelp to-night--I can undress myself. You are not so strong as I am; you\nare tired, I dare say. Don't sit up on my account. Good-night, Louisa,\nand pleasant dreams!\"\n\nHer voice sank lower and lower as she spoke those kind words. She sighed\nheavily, and, leaning her arm on the mantel-piece, laid her head on\nit with a reckless weariness miserable to see. Louisa had not left the\nroom, as she supposed--Louisa came softly to her side, and kissed her\nhand. Magdalen started; but she made no attempt, this time, to draw her\nhand away. The sense of her own horrible isolation subdued her, at the\ntouch of the servant's lips. Her proud heart melted; her eyes filled\nwith burning tears. \"Don't distress me!\" she said, faintly. \"The time\nfor kindness has gone by; it only overpowers me now. Good-night!\"\n\nWhen the morning came, the affirmative answer which Magdalen had\nanticipated was the answer given.\n\nOn that day the landlady received her week's notice to quit, and\nLouisa's needle flew fast through the stitches of the parlor-maid's\ndress.\n\nTHE END OF THE SIXTH SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\n\n\nI.\n\n_From Miss Garth to Mr. Pendril._\n\n\"Westmoreland House, January 3d, 1848.\n\n\"DEAR MR. PENDRIL--I write, as you kindly requested, to report how Norah\nis going on, and to tell you what changes I see for the better in the\nstate of her mind on the subject of her sister.\n\n\"I cannot say that she is becoming resigned to Magdalen's continued\nsilence--I know her faithful nature too well to say it. I can only tell\nyou that she is beginning to find relief from the heavy pressure of\nsorrow and suspense in new thoughts and new hopes. I doubt if she has\nyet realized this in her own mind; but I see the result, although she is\nnot conscious of it herself. I see her heart opening to the consolation\nof another interest and another love. She has not said a word to me on\nthe subject, nor have I said a word to her. But as certainly as I\nknow that Mr. George Bartram's visits have lately grown more and more\nfrequent to the family at Portland Place--so certainly I can assure you\nthat Norah is finding a relief under her suspense, which is not of my\nbringing, and a hope in the future, which I have not taught her to feel.\n\n\"It is needless for me to say that I tell you this in the strictest\nconfidence. God knows whether the happy prospect which seems to me to\nbe just dawning will grow brighter or not as time goes on. The oftener\nI see Mr. George Bartram--and he has called on me more than once--the\nstronger my liking for him grows. To my poor judgment he seems to be a\ngentleman in the highest and truest sense of the word. If I could\nlive to see Norah his wife, I should almost feel that I had lived long\nenough. But who can discern the future? We have suffered so much that I\nam afraid to hope.\n\n\"Have you heard anything of Magdalen? I don't know why or how it is;\nbut since I have known of her husband's death, my old tenderness for her\nseems to cling to me more obstinately than ever. Always yours truly,\n\n\"HARRIET GARTH.\"\n\n\nII\n\n_From Mr. Pendril to Miss Garth._\n\n\"Serle Street, January 4th, 1848.\n\n\"DEAR MISS GARTH--Of Mrs. Noel Vanstone herself I have heard nothing.\nBut I have learned, since I saw you, that the report of the position in\nwhich she is left by the death of her husband may be depended upon as\nthe truth. No legacy of any kind is bequeathed to her. Her name is not\nonce mentioned in her husband's will.\n\n\"Knowing what we know, it is not to be concealed that this circumstance\nthreatens us with more embarrassment, and perhaps with more distress.\nMrs. Noel Vanstone is not the woman to submit, without a desperate\nresistance, to the total overthrow of all her schemes and all her hopes.\nThe mere fact that nothing whatever has been heard of her since her\nhusband's death is suggestive to my mind of serious mischief to come.\nIn her situation, and with her temper, the quieter she is now, the more\ninveterately I, for one, distrust her in the future. It is impossible\nto say to what violent measures her present extremity may not drive her.\nIt is impossible to feel sure that she may not be the cause of some\npublic scandal this time, which may affect her innocent sister as well\nas herself.\n\n\"I know you will not misinterpret the motive which has led me to write\nthese lines; I know you will not think that I am inconsiderate enough\nto cause you unnecessary alarm. My sincere anxiety to see that happy\nprospect realized to which your letter alludes has caused me to write\nfar less reservedly than I might otherwise have written. I strongly urge\nyou to use your influence, on every occasion when you can fairly exert\nit, to strengthen that growing attachment, and to place it beyond the\nreach of any coming disasters, while you have the opportunity of doing\nso. When I tell you that the fortune of which Mrs. Noel Vanstone has\nbeen deprived is entirely bequeathed to Admiral Bartram; and when I\nadd that Mr. George Bartram is generally understood to be his uncle's\nheir--you will, I think, acknowledge that I am not warning you without a\ncause. Yours most truly,\n\n\"WILLIAM PENDRIL.\"\n\n\nIII.\n\nFrom Admiral Bartram to Mrs. Drake (housekeeper at St. Crux).\n\n\"St. Crux, January 10th, 1848.\n\n\"MRS. DRAKE--I have received your letter from London, stating that you\nhave found me a new parlor-maid at last, and that the girl is ready to\nreturn with you to St. Crux when your other errands in town allow you to\ncome back.\n\n\"This arrangement must be altered immediately, for a reason which I am\nheartily sorry to have to write.\n\n\"The illness of my niece, Mrs. Girdlestone--which appeared to be so\nslight as to alarm none of us, doctors included--has ended fatally. I\nreceived this morning the shocking news of her death. Her husband is\nsaid to be quite frantic with grief. Mr. George has already gone to his\nbrother-in-law's, to superintend the last melancholy duties and I\nmust follow him before the funeral takes place. We propose to take Mr.\nGirdlestone away afterward, and to try the effect on him of change of\nplace and new scenes. Under these sad circumstances, I may be absent\nfrom St. Crux a month or six weeks at least; the house will be shut up,\nand the new servant will not be wanted until my return.\n\n\"You will therefore tell the girl, on receiving this letter, that a\ndeath in the family has caused a temporary change in our arrangements.\nIf she is willing to wait, you may safely engage her to come here in six\nweeks' time; I shall be back then, if Mr. George is not. If she refuses,\npay her what compensation is right, and so have done with her. Yours,\n\n\"ARTHUR BARTRAM.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\n_From Mrs. Drake to Admiral Bartram._\n\n\"January 11th.\n\n\"HONORED SIR--I hope to get my errands done, and to return to St. Crux\nto-morrow, but write to save you anxiety, in case of delay.\n\n\"The young woman whom I have engaged (Louisa by name) is willing to wait\nyour time; and her present mistress, taking an interest in her welfare,\nwill provide for her during the interval. She understands that she is to\nenter on her new service in six weeks from the present date--namely, on\nthe twenty-fifth of February next.\n\n\"Begging you will accept my respectful sympathy under the sad\nbereavement which has befallen the family,\n\n\"I remain, honored sir, your humble servant,\n\n\"SOPHIA DRAKE.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEVENTH SCENE.\n\nST. CRUX-IN-THE-MARSH.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\n\"THIS is where you are to sleep. Put yourself tidy, and then come down\nagain to my room. The admiral has returned, and you will have to begin\nby waiting on him at dinner to-day.\"\n\nWith those words, Mrs. Drake, the housekeeper, closed the door; and the\nnew parlor-maid was left alone in her bed-chamber at St. Crux.\n\nThat day was the eventful twenty-fifth of February. In barely four\nmonths from the time when Mrs. Lecount had placed her master's\nprivate Instructions in his Executor's hands, the one combination of\ncircumstances against which it had been her first and foremost object to\nprovide was exactly the combination which had now taken place. Mr. Noel\nVanstone's widow and Admiral Bartram's Secret Trust were together in the\nsame house.\n\nThus far, events had declared themselves without an exception in\nMagdalen's favor. Thus far, the path which had led her to St. Crux had\nbeen a path without an obstacle: Louisa, whose name she had now taken,\nhad sailed three days since for Australia, with her husband and her\nchild; she was the only living creature whom Magdalen had trusted with\nher secret, and she was by this time out of sight of the English land.\nThe girl had been careful, reliable and faithfully devoted to her\nmistress's interests to the last. She had passed the ordeal of\nher interview with the housekeeper, and had forgotten none of the\ninstructions by which she had been prepared to meet it. She had herself\nproposed to turn the six weeks' delay, caused by the death in the\nadmiral's family, to good account, by continuing the all-important\npractice of those domestic lessons, on the perfect acquirement of which\nher mistress's daring stratagem depended for its success. Thanks to\nthe time thus gained, when Louisa's marriage was over, and the day\nof parting had come, Magdalen had learned and mastered, in the nicest\ndetail, everything that her former servant could teach her. On the\nday when she passed the doors of St. Crux she entered on her desperate\nventure, strong in the ready presence of mind under emergencies which\nher later life had taught her, stronger still in the trained capacity\nthat she possessed for the assumption of a character not her own,\nstrongest of all in her two months' daily familiarity with the practical\nduties of the position which she had undertaken to fill.\n\n\nAs soon as Mrs. Drake's departure had left her alone, she unpacked her\nbox, and dressed herself for the evening.\n\nShe put on a lavender-colored stuff-gown--half-mourning for Mrs.\nGirdlestone; ordered for all the servants, under the admiral's\ninstructions--a white muslin apron, and a neat white cap and collar,\nwith ribbons to match the gown. In this servant's costume--in the plain\ngown fastening high round her neck, in the neat little white cap at\nthe back of her head--in this simple dress, to the eyes of all men,\nnot linen-drapers, at once the most modest and the most alluring that\na woman can wear, the sad changes which mental suffering had wrought\nin her beauty almost disappeared from view. In the evening costume of\na lady, with her bosom uncovered, with her figure armed, rather than\ndressed, in unpliable silk, the admiral might have passed her by without\nnotice in his own drawing-room. In the evening costume of a servant,\nno admirer of beauty could have looked at her once and not have turned\nagain to look at her for the second time.\n\nDescending the stairs, on her way to the house-keeper's room, she passed\nby the entrances to two long stone corridors, with rows of doors opening\non them; one corridor situated on the second, and one on the first floor\nof the house. \"Many rooms!\" she thought, as she looked at the doors.\n\"Weary work searching here for what I have come to find!\"\n\nOn reaching the ground-floor she was met by a weather-beaten old man,\nwho stopped and stared at her with an appearance of great interest. He\nwas the same old man whom Captain Wragge had seen in the backyard at St.\nCrux, at work on the model of a ship. All round the neighborhood he was\nknown, far and wide, as \"the admiral's coxswain.\" His name was Mazey.\nSixty years had written their story of hard work at sea, and hard\ndrinking on shore, on the veteran's grim and wrinkled face. Sixty years\nhad proved his fidelity, and had brought his battered old carcass, at\nthe end of the voyage, into port in his master's house.\n\nSeeing no one else of whom she could inquire, Magdalen requested the old\nman to show her the way that led to the housekeeper's room.\n\n\"I'll show you, my dear,\" said old Mazey, speaking in the high and\nhollow voice peculiar to the deaf. \"You're the new maid--eh? And a\nfine-grown girl, too! His honor, the admiral, likes a parlor-maid with a\nclean run fore and aft. You'll do, my dear--you'll do.\"\n\n\"You must not mind what Mr. Mazey says to you,\" remarked the\nhousekeeper, opening her door as the old sailor expressed his approval\nof Magdalen in these terms. \"He is privileged to talk as he pleases;\nand he is very tiresome and slovenly in his habits; but he means no\nharm.\"\n\nWith that apology for the veteran, Mrs. Drake led Magdalen first to\nthe pantry, and next to the linen-room, installing her, with all due\nformality, in her own domestic dominions. This ceremony completed, the\nnew parlor-maid was taken upstairs, and was shown the dining-room, which\nopened out of the corridor on the first floor. Here she was directed to\nlay the cloth, and to prepare the table for one person only--Mr. George\nBartram not having returned with his uncle to St. Crux. Mrs. Drake's\nsharp eyes watched Magdalen attentively as she performed this\nintroductory duty; and Mrs. Drake's private convictions, when the table\nwas spread, forced her to acknowledge, so far, that the new servant\nthoroughly understood her work.\n\nAn hour later the soup-tureen was placed on the table; and Magdalen\nstood alone behind the admiral's empty chair, waiting her master's first\ninspection of her when he entered the dining-room.\n\nA large bell rang in the lower regions--quick, shambling footsteps\npattered on the stone corridor outside--the door opened suddenly--and a\ntall lean yellow old man, sharp as to his eyes, shrewd as to his lips,\nfussily restless as to all his movements, entered the room, with two\nhuge Labrador dogs at his heels, and took his seat in a violent hurry.\nThe dogs followed him, and placed themselves, with the utmost gravity\nand composure, one on each side of his chair. This was Admiral Bartram,\nand these were the companions of his solitary meal.\n\n\"Ay! ay! ay! here's the new parlor-maid, to be sure!\" he began, looking\nsharply, but not at all unkindly, at Magdalen. \"What's your name, my\ngood girl? Louisa, is it? I shall call you Lucy, if you don't mind.\nTake off the cover, my dear--I'm a minute or two late to-day. Don't\nbe unpunctual to-morrow on that account; I am as regular as clock-work\ngenerally. How are you after your journey? Did my spring-cart bump you\nabout much in bringing you from the station? Capital soup this--hot as\nfire--reminds me of the soup we used to have in the West Indies in the\nyear Three. Have you got your half-mourning on? Stand there, and let me\nsee. Ah, yes, very neat, and nice, and tidy. Poor Mrs. Girdlestone! Oh\ndear, dear, dear, poor Mrs. Girdlestone! You're not afraid of dogs, are\nyou, Lucy? Eh? What? You like dogs? That's right! Always be kind to\ndumb animals. These two dogs dine with me every day, except when there's\ncompany. The dog with the black nose is Brutus, and the dog with the\nwhite nose is Cassius. Did you ever hear who Brutus and Cassius were?\nAncient Romans? That's right---good girl. Mind your book and your\nneedle, and we'll get you a good husband one of these days. Take away\nthe soup, my dear, take away the soup!\"\n\nThis was the man whose secret it was now the one interest of Magdalen's\nlife to surprise! This was the man whose name had supplanted hers in\nNoel Vanstone's will!\n\nThe fish and the roast meat followed; and the admiral's talk rambled\non--now in soliloquy, now addressed to the parlor-maid, and now directed\nto the dogs--as familiarly and as discontentedly as ever. Magdalen\nobserved with some surprise that the companions of the admiral's dinner\nhad, thus far, received no scraps from their master's plate. The two\nmagnificent brutes sat squatted on their haunches, with their great\nheads over the table, watching the progress of the meal, with the\nprofoundest attention, but apparently expecting no share in it. The\nroast meat was removed, the admiral's plate was changed, and Magdalen\ntook the silver covers off the two made-dishes on either side of the\ntable. As she handed the first of the savory dishes to her master,\nthe dogs suddenly exhibited a breathless personal interest in the\nproceedings. Brutus gluttonously watered at the mouth; and the tongue of\nCassius, protruding in unutterable expectation, smoked again between his\nenormous jaws.\n\nThe admiral helped himself liberally from the dish; sent Magdalen to the\nside-table to get him some bread; and, when he thought her eye was off\nhim, furtively tumbled the whole contents of his plate into Brutus's\nmouth. Cassius whined faintly as his fortunate comrade swallowed the\nsavory mess at a gulp. \"Hush! you fool,\" whispered the admiral. \"Your\nturn next!\"\n\nMagdalen presented the second dish. Once more the old gentleman helped\nhimself largely--once more he sent her away to the side-table--once\nmore he tumbled the entire contents of the plate down the dog's throat,\nselecting Cassius this time, as became a considerate master and an\nimpartial man. When the next course followed--consisting of a plain\npudding and an unwholesome \"cream\"--Magdalen's suspicion of the function\nof the dogs at the dinner-table was confirmed. While the master took the\nsimple pudding, the dogs swallowed the elaborate cream. The admiral was\nplainly afraid of offending his cook on the one hand, and of offending\nhis digestion on the other--and Brutus and Cassius were the two trained\naccomplices who regularly helped him every day off the horns of his\ndilemma. \"Very good! very good!\" said the old gentleman, with the most\ntransparent duplicity. \"Tell the cook, my dear, a capital cream!\"\n\nHaving placed the wine and dessert on the table, Magdalen was about to\nwithdraw. Before she could leave the room, her master called her back.\n\n\"Stop, stop!\" said the admiral; \"you don't know the ways of the house\nyet, Lucy. Put another wine-glass here, at my right hand--the largest\nyou can find, my dear. I've got a third dog, who comes in at dessert--a\ndrunken old sea-dog who has followed my fortunes, afloat and ashore, for\nfifty years and more. Yes, yes, that's the sort of glass we want. You're\na good girl--you're a neat, handy girl. Steady, my dear! there's nothing\nto be frightened at!\"\n\nA sudden thump on the outside of the door, followed by one mighty bark\nfrom each of the dogs, had made Magdalen start. \"Come in!\" shouted the\nadmiral. The door opened; the tails of Brutus and Cassius cheerfully\nthumped the floor; and old Mazey marched straight up to the right-hand\nside of his master's chair. The veteran stood there, with his legs wide\napart and his balance carefully adjusted, as if the dining-room had been\na cabin, and the house a ship pitching in a sea-way.\n\nThe admiral filled the large glass with port, filled his own glass with\nclaret, and raised it to his lips.\n\n\"God bless the Queen, Mazey,\" said the admiral.\n\n\"God bless the Queen, your honor,\" said old Mazey, swallowing his port,\nas the dogs swallowed the made-dishes, at a gulp.\n\n\"How's the wind, Mazey?\"\n\n\"West and by Noathe, your honor.\"\n\n\"Any report to-night, Mazey!\"\n\n\"No report, your honor.\"\n\n\"Good-evening, Mazey.\"\n\n\"Good-evening, your honor.\"\n\nThe after-dinner ceremony thus completed, old Mazey made his bow, and\nwalked out of the room again. Brutus and Cassius stretched themselves on\nthe rug to digest mushrooms and made gravies in the lubricating heat of\nthe fire. \"For what we have received, the Lord make us truly thankful,\"\nsaid the admiral. \"Go downstairs, my good girl, and get your supper. A\nlight meal, Lucy, if you take my advice--a light meal, or you will\nhave the nightmare. Early to bed, my dear, and early to rise, makes\na parlor-maid healthy and wealthy and wise. That's the wisdom of\nyour ancestors--you mustn't laugh at it. Good-night.\" In those words\nMagdalen was dismissed; and so her first day's experience of Admiral\nBartram came to an end.\n\n\nAfter breakfast the next morning, the admiral's directions to the\nnew parlor-maid included among them one particular order which, in\nMagdalen's situation, it was especially her interest to receive. In the\nold gentleman's absence from home that day, on local business which\ntook him to Ossory, she was directed to make herself acquainted with the\nwhole inhabited quarter of the house, and to learn the positions of the\nvarious rooms, so as to know where the bells called her when the bells\nrang. Mrs. Drake was charged with the duty of superintending the voyage\nof domestic discovery, unless she happened to be otherwise engaged--in\nwhich case any one of the inferior servants would be equally competent\nto act as Magdalen's guide.\n\nAt noon the admiral left for Ossory, and Magdalen presented herself in\nMrs. Drake's room, to be shown over the house. Mrs. Drake happened to\nbe otherwise engaged, and referred her to the head house-maid. The\nhead house-maid happened on that particular morning to be in the same\ncondition as Mrs. Drake, and referred her to the under-house-maids. The\nunder-house-maids declared they were all behindhand and had not a minute\nto spare--they suggested, not too civilly, that old Mazey had nothing on\nearth to do, and that he knew the house as well, or better, than he\nknew his A B C. Magdalen took the hint, with a secret indignation\nand contempt which it cost her a hard struggle to conceal. She had\nsuspected, on the previous night, and she was certain now, that the\nwomen-servants all incomprehensibly resented her presence among them\nwith the same sullen unanimity of distrust. Mrs. Drake, as she had seen\nfor herself, was really engaged that morning over her accounts. But of\nall the servants under her who had made their excuses not one had even\naffected to be more occupied than usual. Their looks said plainly, \"We\ndon't like you; and we won't show you over the house.\"\n\nShe found her way to old Mazey, not by the scanty directions given her,\nbut by the sound of the veteran's cracked and quavering voice, singing\nin some distant seclusion a verse of the immortal sea-song--\"Tom\nBowling.\" Just as she stopped among the rambling stone passages on the\nbasement story of the house, uncertain which way to turn next, she heard\nthe tuneless old voice in the distance, singing these lines:\n\n     \"His form was of the manliest beau-u-u-uty,\n     His heart was ki-i-ind and soft;\n     Faithful below Tom did his duty,\n     But now he's gone alo-o-o-o-oft\n     --But now he's go-o-o-one aloft!\"\n\nMagdalen followed in the direction of the quavering voice, and found\nherself in a little room looking out on the back yard. There sat old\nMazey, with his spectacles low on his nose, and his knotty old hands\nblundering over the rigging of his model ship. There were Brutus\nand Cassius digesting before the fire again, and snoring as if they\nthoroughly enjoyed it. There was Lord Nelson on one wall, in flaming\nwatercolors; and there, on the other, was a portrait of Admiral\nBartram's last flagship, in full sail on a sea of slate, with a\nsalmon-colored sky to complete the illusion.\n\n\"What, they won't show you over the house--won't they?\" said old Mazey.\n\"I will, then! That head house-maid's a sour one, my dear--if ever\nthere was a sour one yet. You're too young and good-looking to please\n'em--that's what you are.\" He rose, took off his spectacles, and feebly\nmended the fire. \"She's as straight as a poplar,\" said old Mazey,\nconsidering Magdalen's figure in drowsy soliloquy. \"I say she's as\nstraight as a poplar, and his honor the admiral says so too! Come along,\nmy dear,\" he proceeded, addressing himself to Magdalen again. \"I'll\nteach you your Pints of the Compass first. When you know your Pints,\nblow high, blow low, you'll find it plain sailing all over the house.\"\n\nHe led the way to the door--stopped, and suddenly bethinking himself\nof his miniature ship, went back to put his model away in an empty\ncupboard--led the way to the door again--stopped once more--remembered\nthat some of the rooms were chilly--and pottered about, swearing and\ngrumbling, and looking for his hat. Magdalen sat down patiently to\nwait for him. She gratefully contrasted his treatment of her with the\ntreatment she had received from the women. Resist it as firmly,\ndespise it as proudly as we may, all studied unkindness--no matter how\ncontemptible it may be--has a stinging power in it which reaches to\nthe quick. Magdalen only knew how she had felt the small malice of\nthe female servants, by the effect which the rough kindness of the old\nsailor produced on her afterward. The dumb welcome of the dogs, when the\nmovements in the room had roused them from their sleep, touched her more\nacutely still. Brutus pushed his mighty muzzle companionably into her\nhand; and Cassius laid his friendly fore-paw on her lap. Her heart\nyearned over the two creatures as she patted and caressed them. It\nseemed only yesterday since she and the dogs at Combe-Raven had roamed\nthe garden together, and had idled away the summer mornings luxuriously\non the shady lawn.\n\nOld Mazey found his hat at last, and they started on their exploring\nexpedition, with the dogs after them.\n\nLeaving the basement story of the house, which was entirely devoted to\nthe servants' offices, they ascended to the first floor, and entered the\nlong corridor, with which Magdalen's last night's experience had already\nmade her acquainted. \"Put your back ag'in this wall,\" said old Mazey,\npointing to the long wall--pierced at irregular intervals with windows\nlooking out over a courtyard and fish-pond--which formed the right-hand\nside of the corridor, as Magdalen now stood. \"Put your back here,\"\nsaid the veteran, \"and look straight afore you. What do you see?\"--\"The\nopposite wall of the passage,\" said Magdalen.--\"Ay! ay! what\nelse?\"--\"The doors leading into the rooms.\"--\"What else?\"--\"I see\nnothing else.\" Old Mazey chuckled, winked, and shook his knotty\nforefinger at Magdalen, impressively. \"You see one of the Pints of the\nCompass, my dear. When you've got your back ag'in this wall, and when\nyou look straight afore you, you look Noathe. If you ever get lost\nhereaway, put your back ag'in the wall, look out straight afore you, and\nsay to yourself: 'I look Noathe!' You do that like a good girl, and you\nwon't lose your bearings.\"\n\nAfter administering this preliminary dose of instruction, old Mazey\nopened the first of the doors on the left-hand side of the passage. It\nled into the dining-room, with which Magdalen was already familiar.\nThe second room was fitted up as a library; and the third, as a\nmorning-room. The fourth and fifth doors--both belonging to dismantled\nand uninhabited rooms, and both locked-brought them to the end of the\nnorth wing of the house, and to the opening of a second and shorter\npassage, placed at a right angle to the first. Here old Mazey, who had\ndivided his time pretty equally during the investigation of the rooms,\nin talking of \"his honor the Admiral,\" and whistling to the dogs,\nreturned with all possible expedition to the points of the compass, and\ngravely directed Magdalen to repeat the ceremony of putting her back\nagainst the wall. She attempted to shorten the proceedings, by declaring\n(quite correctly) that in her present position she knew she was\nlooking east. \"Don't you talk about the east, my dear,\" said old Mazey,\nproceeding unmoved with his own system of instruction, \"till you know\nthe east first. Put your back ag'in this wall, and look straight afore\nyou. What do you see?\" The remainder of the catechism proceeded as\nbefore. When the end was reached, Magdalen's instructor was satisfied.\nHe chuckled and winked at her once more. \"Now you may talk about the\neast, my dear,\" said the veteran, \"for now you know it.\"\n\nThe east passage, after leading them on for a few yards only, terminated\nin a vestibule, with a high door in it which faced them as they\nadvanced. The door admitted them to a large and lofty drawing-room,\ndecorated, like all the other apartments, with valuable old-fashioned\nfurniture. Leading the way across this room, Magdalen's conductor pushed\nback a heavy sliding-door, opposite the door of entrance. \"Put\nyour apron over your head,\" said old Mazey. \"We are coming to the\nBanqueting-Hall now. The floor's mortal cold, and the damp sticks to the\nplace like cockroaches to a collier. His honor the admiral calls it\nthe Arctic Passage. I've got my name for it, too--I call it,\nFreeze-your-Bones.\"\n\nMagdalen passed through the doorway, and found herself in the ancient\nBanqueting-Hall of St. Crux.\n\nOn her left hand she saw a row of lofty windows, set deep in embrasures,\nand extending over a frontage of more than a hundred feet in length. On\nher right hand, ranged in one long row from end to end of the opposite\nwall, hung a dismal collection of black, begrimed old pictures, rotting\nfrom their frames, and representing battle-scenes by sea and land. Below\nthe pictures, midway down the length of the wall, yawned a huge cavern\nof a fireplace, surmounted by a towering mantel-piece of black marble.\nThe one object of furniture (if furniture it might be called) visible\nfar or near in the vast emptiness of the place, was a gaunt ancient\ntripod of curiously chased metal, standing lonely in the middle of the\nhall, and supporting a wide circular pan, filled deep with ashes from\nan extinct charcoal fire. The high ceiling, once finely carved and gilt,\nwas foul with dirt and cobwebs; the naked walls at either end of the\nroom were stained with damp; and the cold of the marble floor struck\nthrough the narrow strip of matting laid down, parallel with the\nwindows, as a foot-path for passengers across the wilderness of the\nroom. No better name for it could have been devised than the name which\nold Mazey had found. \"Freeze-your-Bones\" accurately described, in three\nwords, the Banqueting-Hall at St. Crux.\n\n\"Do you never light a fire in this dismal place?\" asked Magdalen.\n\n\"It all depends on which side of Freeze-your-Bones his honor the\nadmiral lives,\" said old Mazey. \"His honor likes to shift his quarters,\nsometimes to one side of the house, sometimes to the other. If he lives\nNoathe of Freeze-your-Bones--which is where you've just come\nfrom--we don't waste our coals here. If he lives South of\nFreeze-your-Bones--which is where we are going to next--we light the\nfire in the grate and the charcoal in the pan. Every night, when we do\nthat, the damp gets the better of us: every morning, we turn to again,\nand get the better of the damp.\"\n\nWith this remarkable explanation, old Mazey led the way to the lower\nend of the Hall, opened more doors, and showed Magdalen through another\nsuite of rooms, four in number, all of moderate size, and all furnished\nin much the same manner as the rooms in the northern wing. She looked\nout of the windows, and saw the neglected gardens of St. Crux, overgrown\nwith brambles and weeds. Here and there, at no great distance in the\ngrounds, the smoothly curving line of one of the tidal streams peculiar\nto the locality wound its way, gleaming in the sunlight, through gaps\nin the brambles and trees. The more distant view ranged over the flat\neastward country beyond, speckled with its scattered little villages;\ncrossed and recrossed by its network of \"back-waters\"; and terminated\nabruptly by the long straight line of sea-wall which protects the\ndefenseless coast of Essex from invasion by the sea.\n\n\"Have we more rooms still to see?\" asked Magdalen, turning from the view\nof the garden, and looking about her for another door.\n\n\"No more, my dear--we've run aground here, and we may as well wear\nround and put back again,\" said old Mazey. \"There's another side of the\nhouse--due south of you as you stand now--which is all tumbling about\nour ears. You must go out into the garden if you want to see it; it's\nbuilt off from us by a brick bulkhead, t'other side of this wall here.\nThe monks lived due south of us, my dear, hundreds of years afore his\nhonor the admiral was born or thought of, and a fine time of it they\nhad, as I've heard. They sang in the church all the morning, and drank\ngrog in the orchard all the afternoon. They slept off their grog on the\nbest of feather-beds, and they fattened on the neighborhood all the year\nround. Lucky beggars! lucky beggars!\"\n\nApostrophizing the monks in these terms, and evidently regretting that\nhe had not lived himself in those good old times, the veteran led\nthe way back through the rooms. On the return passage across\n\"Freeze-your-Bones,\" Magdalen preceded him. \"She's as straight as a\npoplar,\" mumbled old Mazey to himself, hobbling along after his youthful\ncompanion, and wagging his venerable head in cordial approval. \"I never\nwas particular what nation they belonged to; but I always _did_ like 'em\nstraight and fine grown, and I always _shall_ like 'em straight and fine\ngrown, to my dying day.\"\n\n\"Are there more rooms to see upstairs, on the second floor?\" asked\nMagdalen, when they had returned to the point from which they had\nstarted.\n\nThe naturally clear, distinct tones of her voice had hitherto reached\nthe old sailor's imperfect sense of hearing easily enough. Rather to her\nsurprise, he became stone deaf on a sudden, to her last question.\n\n\"Are you sure of your Pints of the Compass?\" he inquired. \"If you're not\nsure, put your back ag'in the wall, and we'll go all over 'em again, my\ndear, beginning with the Noathe.\"\n\nMagdalen assured him that she felt quite familiar, by this time, with\nall the points, the \"Noathe\" included; and then repeated her question\nin louder tones. The veteran obstinately matched her by becoming deafer\nthan ever.\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" he said, \"you're right; it _is_ chilly in these\npassages; and unless I go back to my fire, my fire'll go out--won't it?\nIf you don't feel sure of your Pints of the Compass, come in to me and\nI'll put you right again.\" He winked benevolently, whistled to the dogs,\nand hobbled off. Magdalen heard him chuckle over his own success in\nbalking her curiosity on the subject of the second floor. \"I know how\nto deal with 'em!\" said old Mazey to himself, in high triumph. \"Tall and\nshort, native and foreign, sweethearts and wives--_I_ know how to deal\nwith 'em!\"\n\nLeft by herself, Magdalen exemplified the excellence of the old sailor's\nmethod of treatment, in her particular case, by ascending the stairs\nimmediately, to make her own observations on the second floor. The stone\npassage here was exactly similar, except that more doors opened out of\nit, to the passage on the first floor. She opened the two nearest doors,\none after another, at a venture, and discovered that both rooms were\nbed-chambers. The fear of being discovered by one of the woman-servants\nin a part of the house with which she had no concern, warned her not to\npush her investigations on the bedroom floor too far at starting. She\nhurriedly walked down the passage to see where it ended, discovered that\nit came to its termination in a lumber-room, answering to the position\nof the vestibule downstairs, and retraced her steps immediately.\n\nOn her way back she noticed an object which had previously escaped her\nattention. It was a low truckle-bed, placed parallel with the wall, and\nclose to one of the doors on the bedroom side. In spite of its strange\nand comfortless situation, the bed was apparently occupied at night by\na sleeper; the sheets were on it, and the end of a thick red fisherman's\ncap peeped out from under the pillow. She ventured on opening the door\nnear which the bed was placed, and found herself, as she conjectured\nfrom certain signs and tokens, in the admiral's sleeping chamber. A\nmoment's observation of the room was all she dared risk, and, softly\nclosing the door again, she returned to the kitchen regions.\n\nThe truckle-bed, and the strange position in which it was placed, dwelt\non her mind all through the afternoon. Who could possibly sleep in it?\nThe remembrance of the red fisherman's cap, and the knowledge she had\nalready gained of Mazey's dog-like fidelity to his master, helped her to\nguess that the old sailor might be the occupant of the truckle-bed. But\nwhy, with bedrooms enough and to spare, should he occupy that cold and\ncomfortless situation at night? Why should he sleep on guard outside his\nmaster's door? Was there some nocturnal danger in the house of which the\nadmiral was afraid? The question seemed absurd, and yet the position of\nthe bed forced it irresistibly on her mind.\n\nStimulated by her own ungovernable curiosity on this subject, Magdalen\nventured to question the housekeeper. She acknowledged having walked\nfrom end to end of the passage on the second floor, to see if it was as\nlong as the passage on the first; and she mentioned having noticed with\nastonishment the position of the truckle-bed. Mrs. Drake answered her\nimplied inquiry shortly and sharply. \"I don't blame a young girl like\nyou,\" said the old lady, \"for being a little curious when she first\ncomes into such a strange house as this. But remember, for the future,\nthat yo ur business does not lie on the bedroom story. Mr. Mazey sleeps\non that bed you noticed. It is his habit at night to sleep outside his\nmaster's door.\" With that meager explanation Mrs. Drake's lips closed,\nand opened no more.\n\nLater in the day Magdalen found an opportunity of applying to old Mazey\nhimself. She discovered the veteran in high good humor, smoking his\npipe, and warming a tin mug of ale at his own snug fire.\n\n\"Mr. Mazey,\" she asked, boldly, \"why do you put your bed in that cold\npassage?\"\n\n\"What! you have been upstairs, you young jade, have you?\" said old\nMazey, looking up from his mug with a leer.\n\nMagdalen smiled and nodded. \"Come! come! tell me,\" she said, coaxingly.\n\"Why do you sleep outside the admiral's door?\"\n\n\"Why do you part your hair in the middle, my dear?\" asked old Mazey,\nwith another leer.\n\n\"I suppose, because I am accustomed to do it,\" answered Magdalen.\n\n\"Ay! ay!\" said the veteran. \"That's why, is it? Well, my dear, the\nreason why you part your hair in the middle is the reason why I sleep\noutside the admiral's door. I know how to deal with 'em!\" chuckled old\nMazey, lapsing into soliloquy, and stirring up his ale in high triumph.\n\"Tall and short, native and foreign, sweethearts and wives--_I_ know how\nto deal with 'em!\"\n\nMagdalen's third and last attempt at solving the mystery of the\ntruckle-bed was made while she was waiting on the admiral at dinner. The\nold gentleman's questions gave her an opportunity of referring to the\nsubject, without any appearance of presumption or disrespect; but he\nproved to be quite as impenetrable, in his way, as old Mazey and Mrs.\nDrake had been in theirs. \"It doesn't concern you, my dear,\" said the\nadmiral, bluntly. \"Don't be curious. Look in your Old Testament when\nyou go downstairs, and see what happened in the Garden of Eden through\ncuriosity. Be a good girl, and don't imitate your mother Eve.\"\n\nLate at night, as Magdalen passed the end of the second-floor passage,\nproceeding alone on her way up to her own room, she stopped and\nlistened. A screen was placed at the entrance of the corridor, so as to\nhide it from the view of persons passing on the stairs. The snoring she\nheard on the other side of the screen encouraged her to slip round it,\nand to advance a few steps. Shading the light of her candle with\nher hand, she ventured close to the admiral's door, and saw, to her\nsurprise, that the bed had been moved since she had seen it in the\nday-time, so as to stand exactly across the door, and to bar the way\nentirely to any one who might attempt to enter the admiral's room.\nAfter this discovery, old Mazey himself, snoring lustily, with the red\nfisherman's cap pulled down to his eyebrows, and the blankets drawn\nup to his nose, became an object of secondary importance only, by\ncomparison with his bed. That the veteran did actually sleep on\nguard before his master's door, and that he and the admiral and the\nhousekeeper were in the secret of this unaccountable proceeding, was now\nbeyond all doubt.\n\n\"A strange end,\" thought Magdalen, pondering over her discovery as she\nstole upstairs to her own sleeping-room--\"a strange end to a strange\nday!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE first week passed, the second week passed, and Magdalen was, to all\nappearance, no nearer to the discovery of the Secret Trust than on the\nday when she first entered on her service at St. Crux.\n\nBut the fortnight, uneventful as it was, had not been a fortnight lost.\nExperience had already satisfied her on one important point--experience\nhad shown that she could set the rooted distrust of the other servants\nsafely at defiance. Time had accustomed the women to her presence in\nthe house, without shaking the vague conviction which possessed them all\nalike, that the newcomer was not one of themselves. All that Magdalen\ncould do in her own defense was to keep the instinctive female suspicion\nof her confined within those purely negative limits which it had\noccupied from the first, and this she accomplished.\n\nDay after day the women watched her with the untiring vigilance of\nmalice and distrust, and day after day not the vestige of a\ndiscovery rewarded them for their pains. Silently, intelligently, and\nindustriously--with an ever-present remembrance of herself and her\nplace--the new parlor-maid did her work. Her only intervals of rest and\nrelaxation were the intervals passed occasionally in the day with old\nMazey and the dogs, and the precious interval of the night during which\nshe was secure from observation in the solitude of her room. Thanks to\nthe superfluity of bed-chambers at St. Crux, each one of the servants\nhad the choice, if she pleased, of sleeping in a room of her own. Alone\nin the night, Magdalen might dare to be herself again--might dream\nof the past, and wake from the dream, encountering no curious eyes\nto notice that she was in tears--might ponder over the future, and\nbe roused by no whisperings in corners, which tainted her with the\nsuspicion of \"having something on her mind.\"\n\nSatisfied, thus far, of the perfect security of her position in the\nhouse, she profited next by a second chance in her favor, which--before\nthe fortnight was at an end--relieved her mind of all doubt on the\nformidable subject of Mrs. Lecount.\n\nPartly from the accidental gossip of the women at the table in the\nservants' hall; partly from a marked paragraph in a Swiss newspaper,\nwhich she had found one morning lying open on the admiral's\neasy-chair--she gained the welcome assurance that no danger was to be\ndreaded, this time, from the housekeeper's presence on the scene. Mrs.\nLecount had, as it appeared, passed a week or more at St. Crux after the\ndate of her master's death, and had then left England, to live on the\ninterest of her legacy, in honorable and prosperous retirement, in\nher native place. The paragraph in the Swiss newspaper described\nthe fulfillment of this laudable project. Mrs. Lecount had not only\nestablished herself at Zurich, but (wisely mindful of the uncertainty of\nlife) had also settled the charitable uses to which her fortune was to\nbe applied after her death. One half of it was to go to the founding of\na \"Lecompte Scholarship\" for poor students in the University of Geneva.\nThe other half was to be employed by the municipal authorities of Zurich\nin the maintenance and education of a certain number of orphan girls,\nnatives of the city, who were to be trained for domestic service\nin later life. The Swiss journalist adverted to these philanthropic\nbequests in terms of extravagant eulogy. Zurich was congratulated on\nthe possession of a Paragon of public virtue; and William Tell, in the\ncharacter of benefactor to Switzerland, was compared disadvantageously\nwith Mrs. Lecount.\n\n\nThe third week began, and Magdalen was now at liberty to take her first\nstep forward on the way to the discovery of the Secret Trust.\n\nShe ascertained from old Mazey that it was his master's custom, during\nthe winter and spring months, to occupy the rooms in the north wing;\nand during the summer and autumn to cross the Arctic passage of\n\"Freeze-your-Bones,\" and live in the eastward apartments which looked\nout on the garden. While the Banqueting-Hall remained--owing to the\nadmiral's inadequate pecuniary resources--in its damp and dismantled\nstate, and while the interior of St. Crux was thus comfortlessly divided\ninto two separate residences, no more convenient arrangement than this\ncould well have been devised. Now and then (as Magdalen understood from\nher informant) there were days, both in winter and summer, when the\nadmiral became anxious about the condition of the rooms which he was not\noccupying at the time, and when he insisted on investigating the state\nof the furniture, the pictures, and the books with his own eyes. On\nthese occasions, in summer as in winter, a blazing fire was kindled for\nsome days previously in the large grate, and the charcoal was lighted\nin the tripod-pan, to keep the Banqueting-Hall as warm as circumstances\nwould admit. As soon as the old gentleman's anxieties were set at rest\nthe rooms were shut up again, and \"Freeze-your-Bones\" was once more\nabandoned for weeks and weeks together to damp, desolation, and decay.\nThe last of these temporary migrations had taken place only a few days\nsince; the admiral had satisfied himself that the rooms in the east wing\nwere none the worse for the absence of their master, and he might now be\nsafely reckoned on as settled in the north wing for weeks, and perhaps,\nif the season was cold, for months to come.\n\nTrifling as they might be in themselves, these particulars were of\nserious importance to Magdalen, for they helped her to fix the limits\nof the field of search. Assuming that the admiral was likely to keep all\nhis important documents within easy reach of his own hand, she might now\nfeel certain that the Secret Trust was secured in one or other of the\nrooms in the north wing.\n\nIn which room? That question was not easy to answer.\n\nOf the four inhabitable rooms which were all at the admiral's disposal\nduring the day--that is to say, of the dining-room, the library, the\nmorning-room, and the drawing-room opening out of the vestibule--the\nlibrary appeared to be the apartment in which, if he had a preference,\nhe passed the greater part of his time. There was a table in this room,\nwith drawers that locked; there was a magnificent Italian cabinet, with\ndoors that locked; there were five cupboards under the book-cases, every\none of which locked. There were receptacles similarly secured in the\nother rooms; and in all or any of these papers might be kept.\n\nShe had answered the bell, and had seen him locking and unlocking,\nnow in one room, now in another, but oftenest in the library. She had\nnoticed occasionally that his expression was fretful and impatient when\nhe looked round at her from an open cabinet or cupboard and gave his\norders; and she inferred that something in connection with his papers\nand possessions--it might or might not be the Secret Trust--irritated\nand annoyed him from time to time. She had heard him more than once lock\nsomething up in one of the rooms, come out and go into another room,\nwait there a few minutes, then return to the first room with his keys in\nhis hand, and sharply turn the locks and turn them again. This fidgety\nanxiety about his keys and his cupboards might be the result of the\ninbred restlessness of his disposition, aggravated in a naturally active\nman by the aimless indolence of a life in retirement--a life drifting\nbackward and forward among trifles, with no regular employment to steady\nit at any given hour of the day. On the other hand, it was just as\nprobable that these comings and goings, these lockings and unlockings,\nmight be attributable to the existence of some private responsibility\nwhich had unexpectedly intruded itself into the old man's easy\nexistence, and which tormented him with a sense of oppression new to the\nexperience of his later years. Either one of these interpretations might\nexplain his conduct as reasonably and as probably as the other. Which\nwas the right interpretation of the two, it was, in Magdalen's position,\nimpossible to say.\n\nThe one certain discovery at which she arrived was made in her first\nday's observation of him. The admiral was a rigidly careful man with his\nkeys.\n\nAll the smaller keys he kept on a ring in the breast-pocket of his coat.\nThe larger he locked up together; generally, but not always, in one of\nthe drawers of the library table. Sometimes he left them secured in this\nway at night; sometimes he took them up to the bedroom with him in a\nlittle basket. He had no regular times for leaving them or for taking\nthem away with him; he had no discoverable reason for now securing them\nin the library-table drawer, and now again locking them up in some other\nplace. The inveterate willfulness and caprice of his proceedings in\nthese particulars defied every effort to reduce them to a system, and\nbaffled all attempts at calculating on them beforehand.\n\nThe hope of gaining positive information to act on, by laying artful\nsnares for him which he might fall into in his talk, proved, from the\noutset, to be utterly futile.\n\nIn Magdalen's situation all experiments of this sort would have been in\nthe last degree difficult and dangerous with any man. With the admiral\nthey were simply impossible. His tendency to veer about from one subject\nto another; his habit of keeping his tongue perpetually going, so long\nas there was anybody, no matter whom, within reach of the sound of his\nvoice; his comical want of all dignity and reserve with his servants,\npromised, in appearance, much, and performed in reality nothing. No\nmatter how diffidently or how respectfully Magdalen might presume on her\nmaster's example, and on her master's evident liking for her, the old\nman instantly discovered the advance she was making from her proper\nposition, and instantly put her back in it again, with a quaint good\nhumor which inflicted no pain, but with a blunt straightforwardness\nof purpose which permitted no escape. Contradictory as it may sound,\nAdmiral Bartram was too familiar to be approached; he kept the distance\nbetween himself and his servant more effectually than if he had been the\nproudest man in England. The systematic reserve of a superior toward an\ninferior may be occasionally overcome--the systematic familiarity never.\n\nSlowly the time dragged on. The fourth week came; and Magdalen had made\nno new discoveries. The prospect was depressing in the last degree. Even\nin the apparently hopeless event of her devising a means of getting at\nthe admiral's keys, she could not count on retaining possession of them\nunsuspected more than a few hours--hours which might be utterly wasted\nthrough her not knowing in what direction to begin the search. The Trust\nmight be locked up in any one of some twenty receptacles for papers,\nsituated in four different rooms; and which room was the likeliest to\nlook in, which receptacle was the most promising to begin with, which\nposition among other heaps of papers the one paper needful might\nbe expected to occupy, was more than she could say. Hemmed in by\nimmeasurable uncertainties on every side; condemned, as it were, to\nwander blindfold on the very brink of success, she waited for the chance\nthat never came, for the event that never happened, with a patience\nwhich was sinking already into the patience of despair.\n\nNight after night she looked back over the vanished days, and not an\nevent rose on her memory to distinguish them one from the other. The\nonly interruptions to the weary uniformity of the life at St. Crux were\ncaused by the characteristic delinquencies of old Mazey and the dogs.\n\nAt certain intervals, the original wildness broke out in the natures of\nBrutus and Cassius. The modest comforts of home, the savory charms of\nmade dishes, the decorous joy of digestions accomplished on hearth-rugs,\nlost all their attractions, and the dogs ungratefully left the house to\nseek dissipation and adventure in the outer world. On these occasions\nthe established after-dinner formula of question and answer between old\nMazey and his master varied a little in one particular. \"God bless\nthe Queen, Mazey,\" and \"How's the wind, Mazey?\" were followed by a new\ninquiry: \"Where are the dogs, Mazey?\" \"Out on the loose, your honor,\nand be damned to 'em,\" was the veteran's unvarying answer. The admiral\nalways sighed and shook his head gravely at the news, as if Brutus and\nCassius had been sons of his own, who treated him with a want of proper\nfilial respect. In two or three days' time the dogs always returned,\nlean, dirty, and heartily ashamed of themselves. For the whole of the\nnext day they were invariably tied up in disgrace. On the day after they\nwere scrubbed clean, and were formally re-admitted to the dining-room.\nThere, Civilization, acting through the subtle medium of the Saucepan,\nrecovered its hold on them; and the admiral's two prodigal sons, when\nthey saw the covers removed, watered at the mouth as copiously as ever.\n\nOld Mazey, in his way, proved to be just as disreputably inclined on\ncertain occasions as the dogs. At intervals, the original wildness in\n_his_ nature broke out; he, too, lost all relish for the comforts of\nhome, and ungratefully left the house. He usually disappeared in the\nafternoon, and returned at night as drunk as liquor could make him. He\nwas by many degrees too seasoned a vessel to meet with any disasters on\nthese occasions. His wicked old legs might take roundabout methods of\nprogression, but they never failed him; his wicked old eyes might see\ndouble, but they always showed him the way home. Try as hard as they\nmight, the servants could never succeed in persuading him that he was\ndrunk; he always scorned the imputation. He even declined to admit the\nidea privately into his mind, until he had first tested his condition by\nan infallible criterion of his own.\n\nIt was his habit, in these cases of Bacchanalian emergency, to stagger\nobstinately into his room on the ground-floor, to take the model-ship\nout of the cupboard, and to try if he could proceed with the\nnever-to-be-completed employment of setting up the rigging. When he had\nsmashed the tiny spars, and snapped asunder the delicate ropes--then,\nand not till then, the veteran admitted facts as they were, on the\nauthority of practical evidence. \"Ay! ay!\" he used to say confidentially\nto himself, \"the women are right. Drunk again, Mazey--drunk again!\"\nHaving reached this discovery, it was his habit to wait cunningly in the\nlower regions until the admiral was safe in his room, and then to ascend\nin discreet list slippers to his post. Too wary to attempt getting into\nthe truckle-bed (which would have been only inviting the catastrophe of\na fall against his master's door), he always walked himself sober up and\ndown the passage. More than once Magdalen had peeped round the screen,\nand had seen the old sailor unsteadily keeping his watch, and fancying\nhimself once more at his duty on board ship. \"This is an uncommonly\nlively vessel in a sea-way,\" he used to mutter under his breath, when\nhis legs took him down the passage in zigzag directions, or left him for\nthe moment studying the \"Pints of the Compass\" on his own system, with\nhis back against the wall. \"A nasty night, mind you,\" he would maunder\non, taking another turn. \"As dark as your pocket, and the wind heading\nus again from the old quarter.\" On the next day old Mazey, like the\ndogs, was kept downstairs in disgrace. On the day after, like the dogs\nagain, he was reinstated in his privileges; and another change was\nintroduced in the after-dinner formula. On entering the room, the\nold sailor stopped short and made his excuses in this brief yet\ncomprehensive form of words, with his back against the door: \"Please\nyour honor, I'm ashamed of myself.\" So the apology began and ended.\n\"This mustn't happen again, Mazey,\" the admiral used to answer. \"It\nshan't happen again, your honor.\" \"Very good. Come here, and drink your\nglass of wine. God bless the Queen, Mazey.\" The veteran tossed off his\nport, and the dialogue ended as usual.\n\nSo the days passed, with no incidents more important than these to\nrelieve their monotony, until the end of the fourth week was at hand.\n\nOn the last day, an event happened; on the last day, the long deferred\npromise of the future unexpectedly began to dawn. While Magdalen was\nspreading the cloth in the dining-room, as usual, Mrs. Drake looked\nin, and instructed her on this occasion, for the first time, to lay\nthe table for two persons. The admiral had received a letter from his\nnephew. Early that evening Mr. George Bartram was expected to return to\nSt. Crux.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nAFTER placing the second cover, Magdalen awaited the ringing of the\ndinner-bell, with an interest and impatience which she found it no easy\ntask to conceal. The return of Mr. Bartram would, in all probability,\nproduce a change in the life of the house; and from change of any kind,\nno matter how trifling, something might be hoped. The nephew might be\naccessible to influences which had failed to reach the uncle. In any\ncase, the two would talk of their affairs over their dinner; and\nthrough that talk--proceeding day after day in her presence--the way\nto discovery, now absolutely invisible, might, sooner or later, show\nitself.\n\nAt last the bell rang, the door opened, and the two gentlemen entered\nthe room together.\n\nMagdalen was struck, as her sister had been struck, by George Bartram's\nresemblance to her father--judging by the portrait at Combe-Raven, which\npresented the likeness of Andrew Vanstone in his younger days. The\nlight hair and florid complexion, the bright blue eyes and hardy upright\nfigure, familiar to her in the picture, were all recalled to her memory,\nas the nephew followed the uncle across the room and took his place\nat table. She was not prepared for this sudden revival of the lost\nassociations of home. Her attention wandered as she tried to conceal its\neffect on her; and she made a blunder in waiting at table, for the first\ntime since she had entered the house.\n\nA quaint reprimand from the admiral, half in jest, half in earnest,\ngave her time to recover herself. She ventured another look at George\nBartram. The impression which he produced on her this time roused her\ncuriosity immediately. His face and manner plainly expressed anxiety and\npreoccupation of mind. He looked oftener at his plate than at his\nuncle, and at Magdalen herself (except one passing inspection of the new\nparlor-maid, when the admiral spoke to her) he never looked at all. Some\nuncertainty was evidently troubling his thoughts; some oppression\nwas weighing on his natural freedom of manner. What uncertainty? what\noppression? Would any personal revelations come out, little by little,\nin the course of conversation at the dinner-table?\n\nNo. One set of dishes followed another set of dishes, and nothing in the\nshape of a personal revelation took place. The conversation halted on\nirregularly, between public affairs on one side and trifling private\ntopics on the other. Politics, home and foreign, took their turn with\nthe small household history of St. Crux; the leaders of the revolution\nwhich expelled Louis Philippe from the throne of France marched side\nby side, in the dinner-table review, with old Mazey and the dogs. The\ndessert was put on the table, the old sailor came in, drank his loyal\ntoast, paid his respects to \"Master George,\" and went out again.\nMagdalen followed him, on her way back to the servants' offices, having\nheard nothing in the conversation of the slightest importance to the\nfurtherance of her own design, from the first word of it to the last.\nShe struggled hard not to lose heart and hope on the first day. They\ncould hardly talk again to-morrow, they could hardly talk again the next\nday, of the French Revolution and the dogs. Time might do wonders yet;\nand time was all her own.\n\n\nLeft together over their wine, the uncle and nephew drew their\neasy-chairs on either side of the fire; and, in Magdalen's absence,\nbegan the very conversation which it was Magdalen's interest to hear.\n\n\"Claret, George?\" said the admiral, pushing the bottle across the table.\n\"You look out of spirits.\"\n\n\"I am a little anxious, sir,\" replied George, leaving his glass empty,\nand looking straight into the fire.\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" rejoined the admiral. \"I am more than a\nlittle anxious myself, I can tell you. Here we are at the last days of\nMarch--and nothing done! Your time comes to an end on the third of May;\nand there you sit, as if you had years still before you, to turn round\nin.\"\n\nGeorge smiled, and resignedly helped himself to some wine.\n\n\"Am I really to understand, sir,\" he asked, \"that you are serious in\nwhat you said to me last November? Are you actually resolved to bind me\nto that incomprehensible condition?\"\n\n\"I don't call it incomprehensible,\" said the admiral, irritably.\n\n\"Don't you, sir? I am to inherit your estate, unconditionally--as you\nhave generously settled it from the first. But I am not to touch a\nfarthing of the fortune poor Noel left you unless I am married within\na certain time. The house and lands are to be mine (thanks to your\nkindness) under any circumstances. But the money with which I might\nimprove them both is to be arbitrarily taken away from me, if I am not a\nmarried man on the third of May. I am sadly wanting in intelligence, I\ndare say, but a more incomprehensible proceeding I never heard of!\"\n\n\"No snapping and snarling, George! Say your say out. We don't\nunderstand sneering in Her Majesty's Navy!\"\n\n\"I mean no offense, sir. But I think it's a little hard to astonish\nme by a change of proceeding on your part, entirely foreign to my\nexperience of your character--and then, when I naturally ask for an\nexplanation, to turn round coolly and leave me in the dark. If you and\nNoel came to some private arrangement together before he made his will,\nwhy not tell me? Why set up a mystery between us, where no mystery need\nbe?\"\n\n\"I won't have it, George!\" cried the admiral, angrily drumming on the\ntable with the nutcrackers. \"You are trying to draw me like a badger,\nbut I won't be drawn! I'll make any conditions I please; and I'll be\naccountable to nobody for them unless I like. It's quite bad enough to\nhave worries and responsibilities laid on my unlucky shoulders that I\nnever bargained for--never mind what worries: they're not yours, they're\nmine--without being questioned and cross-questioned as if I was a\nwitness in a box. Here's a pretty fellow!\" continued the admiral,\napostrophizing his nephew in red-hot irritation, and addressing himself\nto the dogs on the hearth-rug for want of a better audience. \"Here's a\npretty fellow? He is asked to help himself to two uncommonly comfortable\nthings in their way--a fortune and a wife; he is allowed six months to\nget the wife in (we should have got her, in the Navy, bag and baggage,\nin six days); he has a round dozen of nice girls, to my certain\nknowledge, in one part of the country and another, all at his disposal\nto choose from, and what does he do? He sits month after month, with his\nlazy legs crossed before him; he leaves the girls to pine on the\nstem, and he bothers his uncle to know the reason why! I pity the poor\nunfortunate women. Men were made of flesh and blood, and plenty of it,\ntoo, in my time. They're made of machinery now.\"\n\n\"I can only repeat, sir, I am sorry to have offended you,\" said George.\n\n\"Pooh! pooh! you needn't look at me in that languishing way if you are,\"\nretorted the admiral. \"Stick to your wine, and I'll forgive you. Your\ngood health, George. I'm glad to see you again at St. Crux. Look at that\nplateful of sponge-cakes! The cook has sent them up in honor of your\nreturn. We can't hurt her feelings, and we can't spoil our wine.\nHere!\"--The admiral tossed four sponge-cakes in quick succession down\nthe accommodating throats of the dogs. \"I am sorry, George,\" the old\ngentleman gravely proceeded; \"I am really sorry you haven't got your eye\non one of those nice girls. You don't know what a loss you're inflicting\non yourself; you don't know what trouble and mortification you're\ncausing me by this shilly-shally conduct of yours.\"\n\n\"If you would only allow me to explain myself, sir, you would view my\nconduct in a totally different light. I am ready to marry to-morrow, if\nthe lady will have me.\"\n\n\"The devil you are! So you have got a lady in your eye, after all?\nWhy in Heaven's name couldn't you tell me so before? Never mind, I'll\nforgive you everything, now I know you have laid your hand on a wife.\nFill your glass again. Here's her health in a bumper. By-the-by, who is\nshe?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you directly, admiral. When we began this conversation, I\nmentioned that I was a little anxious--\"\n\n\"She's not one of my round dozen of nice girls--aha, Master George, I\nsee that in your face already! Why are you anxious?\"\n\n\"I am afraid you will disapprove of my choice, sir.\"\n\n\"Don't beat about the bush! How the deuce can I say whether I disapprove\nor not, if you won't tell me who she is?\"\n\n\"She is the eldest daughter of Andrew Vanstone, of Combe-Raven.\"\n\n\"Who!!!\"\n\n\"Miss Vanstone, sir.\"\n\nThe admiral put down his glass of wine untasted.\n\n\"You're right, George,\" he said. \"I do disapprove of your choice\n--strongly disapprove of it.\"\n\n\"Is it the misfortune of her birth, sir, that you object to?\"\n\n\"God forbid! the misfortune of her birth is not her fault, poor thing.\nYou know as well as I do, George, what I object to.\"\n\n\"You object to her sister?\"\n\n\"Certainly! The most liberal man alive might object to her sister, I\nthink.\"\n\n\"It's hard, sir, to make Miss Vanstone suffer for her sister's faults.\"\n\n\"_Faults_, do you call them? You have a mighty convenient memory,\nGeorge, when your own interests are concerned.\"\n\n\"Call them crimes if you like, sir--I say again, it's hard on Miss\nVanstone. Miss Vanstone's life is pure of all reproach. From first to\nlast she has borne her hard lot with such patience, and sweetness, and\ncourage as not one woman in a thousand would have shown in her place.\nAsk Miss Garth, who has known her from childhood. Ask Mrs. Tyrrel, who\nblesses the day when she came into the house--\"\n\n\"Ask a fiddlestick's end! I beg your pardon, George, but you are enough\nto try the patience of a saint. My good fellow, I don't deny Miss\nVanstone's virtues. I'll admit, if you like, she's the best woman that\never put on a petticoat. That is not the question--\"\n\n\"Excuse me, admiral--it _is_ the question, if she is to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Hear me out, George; look at it from my point of view, as well as your\nown. What did your cousin Noel do? Your cousin Noel fell a victim, poor\nfellow, to one of the vilest conspiracies I ever heard of, and the\nprime mover of that conspiracy was Miss Vanstone's damnable sister. She\ndeceived him in the most infamous manner; and as soon as she was down\nfor a handsome legacy in his will, she had the poison ready to take his\nlife. This is the truth; we know it from Mrs. Lecount, who found the\nbottle locked up in her own room. If you marry Miss Vanstone, you make\nthis wretch your sister-in-law. She becomes a member of our family. All\nthe disgrace of what she has done; all the disgrace of what she _may_\ndo--and the Devil, who possesses her, only knows what lengths she may go\nto next--becomes _our_ disgrace. Good heavens, George, consider what a\nposition that is! Consider what pitch you touch, if you make this woman\nyour sister-in-law.\"\n\n\"You have put your side of the question, admiral,\" said George\nresolutely; \"now let me put mine. A certain impression is produced on me\nby a young lady whom I meet with under very interesting circumstances.\nI don't act headlong on that impression, as I might have done if I had\nbeen some years younger; I wait, and put it to the trial. Every time I\nsee this young lady the impression strengthens; her beauty grows on me,\nher character grows on me; when I am away from her, I am restless and\ndissatisfied; when I am with her, I am the happiest man alive. All I\nhear of her conduct from those who know her best more than confirms the\nhigh opinion I have formed of her. The one drawback I can discover is\ncaused by a misfortune for which she is not responsible--the\nmisfortune of having a sister who is utterly unworthy of her. Does this\ndiscovery--an unpleasant discovery, I grant you--destroy all those good\nqualities in Miss Vanstone for which I love and admire her? Nothing of\nthe sort--it only makes her good qualities all the more precious to me\nby contrast. If I am to have a drawback to contend with--and who\nexpects anything else in this world?--I would infinitely rather have the\ndrawback attached to my wife's sister than to my wife. My wife's sister\nis not essential to my happiness, but my wife is. In my opinion, sir,\nMrs. Noel Vanstone has done mischief enough already. I don't see the\nnecessity of letting her do more mischief, by depriving me of a good\nwife. Right or wrong, that is my point of view. I don't wish to trouble\nyou with any questions of sentiment. All I wish to say is that I am old\nenough by this time to know my own mind, and that my mind is made up.\nIf my marriage is essential to the execution of your intentions on my\nbehalf, there is only one woman in the world whom I _can_ marry, and\nthat woman is Miss Vanstone.\"\n\nThere was no resisting this plain declaration. Admiral Bartram rose from\nhis chair without making any reply, and walked perturbedly up and down\nthe room.\n\nThe situation was emphatically a serious one. Mrs. Girdlestone's death\nhad already produced the failure of one of the two objects contemplated\nby the Secret Trust. If the third of May arrived and found George a\nsingle man, the second (and last) of the objects would then have failed\nin its turn. In little more than a fortnight, at the very latest, the\nBanns must be published in Ossory church, or the time would fail for\ncompliance with one of the stipulations insisted on in the Trust.\nObstinate as the admiral was by nature, strongly as he felt the\nobjections which attached to his nephew's contemplated alliance, he\nrecoiled in spite of himself, as he paced the room and saw the facts on\neither side immovably staring him in the face.\n\n\"Are you engaged to Miss Vanstone?\" he asked, suddenly.\n\n\"No, sir,\" replied George. \"I thought it due to your uniform kindness to\nme to speak to you on the subject first.\"\n\n\"Much obliged, I'm sure. And you have put off speaking to me to the last\nmoment, just as you put off everything else. Do you think Miss Vanstone\nwill say yes when you ask her?\"\n\nGeorge hesitated.\n\n\"The devil take your modesty!\" shouted the admiral. \"This is not a time\nfor modesty; this is a time for speaking out. Will she or won't she?\"\n\n\"I think she will, sir.\"\n\nThe admiral laughed sardonically, and took another turn in the room.\nHe suddenly stopped, put his hands in his pockets, and stood still in\na corner, deep in thought. After an interval of a few minutes, his\nface cleared a little; it brightened with the dawning of a new idea.\nHe walked round briskly to George's side of the fire, and laid his hand\nkindly on his nephew's shoulder.\n\n\"You're wrong, George,\" he said; \"but it is too late now to set you\nright. On the sixteenth of next month the Banns must be put up in Ossory\nchurch, or you will lose the money. Have you told Miss Vanstone the\nposition you stand in? Or have you put that off to the eleventh hour,\nlike everything else?\"\n\n\"The position is so extraordinary, sir, and it might lead to so much\nmisapprehension of my motives, that I have felt unwilling to allude to\nit. I hardly know how I can tell her of it at all.\"\n\n\"Try the experiment of telling her friends. Let them know it's a\nquestion of money, and they will overcome her scruples, if you can't.\nBut that is not what I had to say to you. How long do you propose\nstopping here this time?\"\n\n\"I thought of staying a few days, and then--\"\n\n\"And then of going back to London and making your offer, I suppose?\nWill a week give you time enough to pick your opportunity with Miss\nVanstone--a week out of the fortnight or so that you have to spare?\"\n\n\"I will stay here a week, admiral, with pleasure, if you wish it.\"\n\n\"I don't wish it. I want you to pack up your traps and be off\nto-morrow.\"\n\nGeorge looked at his uncle in silent astonishment.\n\n\"You found some letters waiting for you when you got here,\" proceeded\nthe admiral. \"Was one of those letters from my old friend, Sir Franklin\nBrock?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Was it an invitation to you to go and stay at the Grange?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"To go at once?\"\n\n\"At once, if I could manage it.\"\n\n\"Very good. I want you to manage it; I want you to start for the Grange\nto-morrow.\"\n\nGeorge looked back at the fire, and sighed impatiently.\n\n\"I understand you now, admiral,\" he said. \"You are entirely mistaken\nin me. My attachment to Miss Vanstone is not to be shaken in _that_\nmanner.\"\n\nAdmiral Bartram took his quarter-deck walk again, up and down the room.\n\n\"One good turn deserves another, George,\" said the old gentleman. \"If\nI am willing to make concessions on my side, the least you can do is to\nmeet me half-way, and make concessions on yours.\"\n\n\"I don't deny it, sir.\"\n\n\"Very well. Now listen to my proposal. Give me a fair hearing, George--a\nfair hearing is every man's privilege. I will be perfectly just to begin\nwith. I won't attempt to deny that you honestly believe Miss Vanstone\nis the only woman in the world who can make you happy. I don't question\nthat. What I do question is, whether you really know your own mind in\nthis matter quite so well as you think you know it yourself. You can't\ndeny, George, that you have been in love with a good many women in your\ntime? Among the rest of them, you have been in love with Miss Brock.\nNo longer ago than this time last year there was a sneaking kindness\nbetween you and that young lady, to say the least of it. And quite\nright, too! Miss Brock is one of that round dozen of darlings I\nmentioned over our first glass of wine.\"\n\n\"You are confusing an idle flirtation, sir, with a serious attachment,\"\nsaid George. \"You are altogether mistaken--you are, indeed.\"\n\n\"Likely enough; I don't pretend to be infallible--I leave that to my\njuniors. But I happen to have known you, George, since you were the\nheight of my old telescope; and I want to have this serious attachment\nof yours put to the test. If you can satisfy me that your whole heart\nand soul are as strongly set on Miss Vanstone as you suppose them to be,\nI must knock under to necessity, and keep my objections to myself. But I\n_must_ be satisfied first. Go to the Grange to-morrow, and stay there a\nweek in Miss Brock's society. Give that charming girl a fair chance of\nlighting up the old flame again if she can, and then come back to St.\nCrux, and let me hear the result. If you tell me, as an honest man, that\nyour attachment to Miss Vanstone still remains unshaken, you will have\nheard the last of my objections from that moment. Whatever misgivings I\nmay feel in my own mind, I will say nothing, and do nothing, adverse to\nyour wishes. There is my proposal. I dare say it looks like an old man's\nfolly, in your eyes. But the old man won't trouble you much longer,\nGeorge; and it may be a pleasant reflection, when you have got sons of\nyour own, to remember that you humored him in his last days.\"\n\nHe came back to the fire-place as he said those words, and laid his hand\nonce more on his nephew's shoulder. George took the hand and pressed it\naffectionately. In the tenderest and best sense of the word, his uncle\nhad been a father to him.\n\n\"I will do what you ask me, sir,\" he replied, \"if you seriously wish it.\nBut it is only right to tell you that the experiment will be perfectly\nuseless. However, if you prefer my passing a week at the Grange to my\npassing it here, to the Grange I will go.\"\n\n\"Thank you, George,\" said the admiral, bluntly. \"I expected as much from\nyou, and you have not disappointed me.--If Miss Brock doesn't get us out\nof this mess,\" thought the wily old gentleman, as he resumed his place\nat the table, \"my nephew's weather-cock of a head has turned steady with\na vengeance!--We'll consider the question settled for to-night, George,\"\nhe continued, aloud, \"and call another subject. These family anxieties\ndon't improve the flavor of my old claret. The bottle stands with you.\nWhat are they doing at the theaters in London? We always patronized the\ntheaters, in my time, in the Navy. We used to like a good tragedy\nto begin with, and a hornpipe to cheer us up at the end of the\nentertainment.\"\n\nFor the rest of the evening, the talk flowed in the ordinary channels.\nAdmiral Bartram only returned to the forbidden subject when he and his\nnephew parted for the night.\n\n\"You won't forget to-morrow, George?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, sir. I'll take the dog-cart, and drive myself over after\nbreakfast.\"\n\n\nBefore noon the next day Mr. George Bartram had left the house, and the\nlast chance in Magdalen's favor had left it with him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nWHEN the servants' dinner-bell at St. Crux rang as usual on the day of\nGeorge Bartram's departure, it was remarked that the new parlor-maid's\nplace at table remained empty. One of the inferior servants was sent\nto her room to make inquiries, and returned with the information that\n\"Louisa\" felt a little faint, and begged that her attendance at table\nmight be excused for that day. Upon this, the superior authority of the\nhousekeeper was invoked, and Mrs. Drake went upstairs immediately to\nascertain the truth for herself. Her first look of inquiry satisfied her\nthat the parlor-maid's indisposition, whatever the cause of it might\nbe, was certainly not assumed to serve any idle or sullen purpose of\nher own. She respectfully declined taking any of the remedies which the\nhousekeeper offered, and merely requested permission to try the efficacy\nof a walk in the fresh air.\n\n\"I have been accustomed to more exercise, ma'am, than I take here,\" she\nsaid. \"Might I go into the garden, and try what the air will do for me?\"\n\n\"Certainly. Can you walk by yourself, or shall I send some one with\nyou?\"\n\n\"I will go by myself, if you please, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Very well. Put on your bonnet and shawl, and, when you get out, keep in\nthe east garden. The admiral sometimes walks in the north garden, and he\nmight feel surprised at seeing you there. Come to my room, when you have\nhad air and exercise enough, and let me see how you are.\"\n\nIn a few minutes more Magdalen was out in the east garden. The sky was\nclear and sunny; but the cold shadow of the house rested on the garden\nwalk and chilled the midday air. She walked toward the ruins of the\nold monastery, situated on the south side of the more modern range of\nbuildings. Here there were lonely open spaces to breathe in freely; here\nthe pale March sunshine stole through the gaps of desolation and decay,\nand met her invitingly with the genial promise of spring.\n\nShe ascended three or four riven stone steps, and seated herself on some\nruined fragments beyond them, full in the sunshine. The place she had\nchosen had once been the entrance to the church. In centuries long gone\nby, the stream of human sin and human suffering had flowed, day after\nday, to the confessional, over the place where she now sat. Of all the\nmiserable women who had trodden those old stones in the bygone time,\nno more miserable creature had touched them than the woman whose feet\nrested on them now.\n\nHer hands trembled as she placed them on either side of her, to support\nherself on the stone seat. She laid them on her lap; they trembled\nthere. She held them out, and looked at them wonderingly; they trembled\nas she looked. \"Like an old woman!\" she said, faintly, and let them drop\nagain at her side.\n\nFor the first time, that morning, the cruel discovery had forced itself\non her mind--the discovery that her strength was failing her, at the\ntime when she had most confidently trusted to it, at the time when she\nwanted it most. She had felt the surprise of Mr. Bartram's unexpected\ndeparture, as if it had been the shock of the severest calamity that\ncould have befallen her. That one check to her hopes--a check which at\nother times would only have roused the resisting power in her to new\nefforts--had struck her with as suffocating a terror, had prostrated her\nwith as all-mastering a despair, as if she had been overwhelmed by the\ncrowning disaster of expulsion from St. Crux. But one warning could be\nread in such a change as this. Into the space of little more than a\nyear she had crowded the wearing and wasting emotions of a life. The\nbountiful gifts of health and strength, so prodigally heaped on her by\nNature, so long abused with impunity, were failing her at last.\n\nShe looked up at the far faint blue of the sky. She heard the joyous\nsinging of birds among the ivy that clothed the ruins. Oh the cold\ndistance of the heavens! Oh the pitiless happiness of the birds! Oh the\nlonely horror of sitting there, and feeling old and weak and worn, in\nthe heyday of her youth! She rose with a last effort of resolution,\nand tried to keep back the hysterical passion swelling at her heart by\nmoving and looking about her. Rapidly and more rapidly she walked to and\nfro in the sunshine. The exercise helped her, through the very fatigue\nthat she felt from it. She forced the rising tears desperately back to\ntheir sources; she fought with the clinging pain, and wrenched it from\nits hold. Little by little her mind began to clear again: the despairing\nfear of herself grew less vividly present to her thoughts. There were\nreserves of youth and strength in her still to be wasted; there was a\nspirit sorely wounded, but not yet subdued.\n\nShe gradually extended the limits of her walk; she gradually recovered\nthe exercise of her observation.\n\nAt the western extremity the remains of the monastery were in a less\nruinous condition than at the eastern. In certain places, where the\nstout old walls still stood, repairs had been made at some former time.\nRoofs of red tile had been laid roughly over four of the ancient cells;\nwooden doors had been added; and the old monastic chambers had been\nused as sheds to hold the multifarious lumber of St. Crux. No padlocks\nguarded any of the doors. Magdalen had only to push them to let the\ndaylight in on the litter inside. She resolved to investigate the sheds\none after the other--not from curiosity, not with the idea of making\ndiscoveries of any sort. Her only object was to fill up the vacant time,\nand to keep the thoughts that unnerved her from returning to her mind.\n\nThe first shed she opened contained the gardener's utensils, large and\nsmall. The second was littered with fragments of broken furniture,\nempty picture-frames of worm-eaten wood, shattered vases, boxes without\ncovers, and books torn from their bindings. As Magdalen turned to leave\nthe shed, after one careless glance round her at the lumber that it\ncontained, her foot struck something on the ground which tinkled against\na fragment of china lying near it. She stooped, and discovered that the\ntinkling substance was a rusty key.\n\nShe picked up the key and looked at it. She walked out into the air, and\nconsidered a little. More old forgotten keys were probably lying about\namong the lumber in the sheds. What if she collected all she could find,\nand tried them, one after another, in the locks of the cabinets and\ncupboards now closed against her? Was there chance enough that any one\nof them might fit to justify her in venturing on the experiment? If the\nlocks at St. Crux were as old-fashioned as the furniture--if there were\nno protective niceties of modern invention to contend against--there was\nchance enough beyond all question. Who could say whether the very key\nin her hand might not be the lost duplicate of one of the keys on the\nadmiral's bunch? In the dearth of all other means of finding the way to\nher end, the risk was worth running. A flash of the old spirit sparkled\nin her weary eyes as she turned and re-entered the shed.\n\nHalf an hour more brought her to the limits of the time which she could\nventure to allow herself in the open air. In that interval she had\nsearched the sheds from first to last, and had found five more keys.\n\"Five more chances!\" she thought to herself, as she hid the keys, and\nhastily returned to the house.\n\nAfter first reporting herself in the housekeeper's room, she went\nupstairs to remove her bonnet and shawl; taking that opportunity to hide\nthe keys in her bed-chamber until night came. They were crusted thick\nwith rust and dirt; but she dared not attempt to clean them until\nbed-time secluded her from the prying eyes of the servants in the\nsolitude of her room.\n\nWhen the dinner hour brought her, as usual, into personal contact with\nthe admiral, she was at once struck by a change in him. For the first\ntime in her experience the old gentleman was silent and depressed.\nHe ate less than usual, and he hardly said five words to her from the\nbeginning of the meal to the end. Some unwelcome subject of reflection\nhad evidently fixed itself on his mind, and remained there persistently,\nin spite of his efforts to shake it off. At intervals through the\nevening, she wondered with an ever-growing perplexity what the subject\ncould be.\n\nAt last the lagging hours reached their end, and bed-time came. Before\nshe slept that night Magdalen had cleaned the keys from all impurities,\nand had oiled the wards, to help them smoothly into the locks. The last\ndifficulty that remained was the difficulty of choosing the time when\nthe experiment might be tried with the least risk of interruption and\ndiscovery. After carefully considering the question overnight, Magdalen\ncould only resolve to wait and be guided by the events of the next day.\n\nThe morning came, and for the first time at St. Crux events justified\nthe trust she had placed in them. The morning came, and the one\nremaining difficulty that perplexed her was unexpectedly smoothed away\nby no less a person than the admiral himself! To the surprise of every\none in the house, he announced at breakfast that he had arranged to\nstart for London in an hour; that he should pass the night in town; and\nthat he might be expected to return to St. Crux in time for dinner on\nthe next day. He volunteered no further explanations to the housekeeper\nor to any one else, but it was easy to see that his errand to London\nwas of no ordinary importance in his own estimation. He swallowed his\nbreakfast in a violent hurry, and he was impatiently ready for the\ncarriage before it came to the door.\n\nExperience had taught Magdalen to be cautious. She waited a little,\nafter Admiral Bartram's departure, before she ventured on trying her\nexperiment with the keys. It was well she did so. Mrs. Drake took\nadvantage of the admiral's absence to review the condition of the\napartments on the first floor. The results of the investigation by\nno means satisfied her; brooms and dusters were set to work; and the\nhouse-maids were in and out of the rooms perpetually, as long as the\ndaylight lasted.\n\nThe evening passed, and still the safe opportunity for which Magdalen\nwas on the watch never presented itself. Bed-time came again, and found\nher placed between the two alternatives of trusting to the doubtful\nchances of the next morning, or of trying the keys boldly in the dead\nof night. In former times she would have made her choice without\nhesitation. She hesitated now; but the wreck of her old courage still\nsustained her, and she determined to make the venture at night.\n\nThey kept early hours at St. Crux. If she waited in her room until\nhalf-past eleven, she would wait long enough. At that time she stole out\non to the staircase, with the keys in her pocket, and the candle in her\nhand.\n\nOn passing the entrance to the corridor on the bedroom floor, she\nstopped and listened. No sound of snoring, no shuffling of infirm\nfootsteps was to be heard on the other side of the screen. She looked\nround it distrustfully. The stone passage was a solitude, and the\ntruckle-bed was empty. Her own eyes had shown her old Mazey on his way\nto the upper regions, more than an hour since, with a candle in his\nhand. Had he taken advantage of his master's absence to enjoy the\nunaccustomed luxury of sleeping in a room? As the thought occurred to\nher, a sound from the further end of the corridor just caught her ear.\nShe softly advanced toward it, and heard through the door of the last\nand remotest of the spare bed-chambers the veteran's lusty snoring in\nthe room inside. The discovery was startling, in more senses than one.\nIt deepened the impenetrable mystery of the truckle-bed; for it showed\nplainly that old Mazey had no barbarous preference of his own for\npassing his nights in the corridor; he occupied that strange and\ncomfortless sleeping-place purely and entirely on his master's account.\n\nIt was no time for dwelling on the reflections which this conclusion\nmight suggest. Magdalen retraced her steps along the passage, and\ndescended to the first floor. Passing the doors nearest to her, she\ntried the library first. On the staircase and in the corridors she had\nfelt her heart throbbing fast with an unutterable fear; but a sense of\nsecurity returned to her when she found herself within the four walls of\nthe room, and when she had closed the door on the ghostly quiet outside.\n\nThe first lock she tried was the lock of the table-drawer. None of the\nkeys fitted it. Her next experiment was made on the cabinet. Would the\nsecond attempt fail, like the first?\n\nNo! One of the keys fitted; one of the keys, with a little patient\nmanagement, turned the lock. She looked in eagerly. There were open\nshelves above, and one long drawer under them. The shelves were devoted\nto specimens of curious minerals, neatly labeled and arranged. The\ndrawer was divided into compartments. Two of the compartments contained\npapers. In the first, she discovered nothing but a collection of\nreceipted bills. In the second, she found a heap of business documents;\nbut the writing, yellow with age, was enough of itself to warn her that\nthe Trust was not there. She shut the doors of the cabinet, and, after\nlocking them again with some little difficulty, proceeded to try\nthe keys in the bookcase cupboards next, before she continued her\ninvestigations in the other rooms.\n\nThe bookcase cupboards were unassailable, the drawers and cupboards in\nall the other rooms were unassailable. One after another she tried them\npatiently in regular succession. It was useless. The chance which the\ncabinet in the library had offered in her favor was the first chance and\nthe last.\n\nShe went back to her room, seeing nothing but her own gliding shadow,\nhearing nothing but her own stealthy footfall in the midnight stillness\nof the house. After mechanically putting the keys away in their former\nhiding-place, she looked toward her bed, and turned away from it,\nshuddering. The warning remembrance of what she had suffered that\nmorning in the garden was vividly present to her mind. \"Another chance\ntried,\" she thought to herself, \"and another chance lost! I shall break\ndown again if I think of it; and I shall think of it if I lie awake in\nthe dark.\" She had brought a work-box with her to St. Crux, as one\nof the many little things which in her character of a servant it was\ndesirable to possess; and she now opened the box and applied herself\nresolutely to work. Her want of dexterity with her needle assisted the\nobject she had in view; it obliged her to pay the closest attention to\nher employment; it forced her thoughts away from the two subjects of all\nothers which she now dreaded most--herself and the future.\n\nThe next day, as he had arranged, the admiral returned. His visit to\nLondon had not improved his spirits. The shadow of some unconquerable\ndoubt still clouded his face; his restless tongue was strangely quiet,\nwhile Magdalen waited on him at his solitary meal. That night the\nsnoring resounded once more on the inner side of the screen, and old\nMazey was back again in the comfortless truckle-bed.\n\nThree more days passed--April came. On the second of the month\n--returning as unexpectedly as he had departed a week before--Mr. George\nBartram re-appeared at St. Crux.\n\nHe came back early in the afternoon, and had an interview with his uncle\nin the library. The interview over, he left the house again, and was\ndriven to the railway by the groom in time to catch the last train to\nLondon that night. The groom noticed, on the road, that \"Mr. George\nseemed to be rather pleased than otherwise at leaving St. Crux.\" He also\nremarked, on his return, that the admiral swore at him for overdriving\nthe horses--an indication of ill-temper, on the part of his master,\nwhich he described as being entirely without precedent in all his former\nexperience. Magdalen, in her department of service, had suffered in like\nmanner under the old man's irritable humor: he had been dissatisfied\nwith everything she did in the dining-room; and he had found fault with\nall the dishes, one after another, from the mutton-broth to the toasted\ncheese.\n\nThe next two days passed as usual. On the third day an event happened.\nIn appearance, it was nothing more important than a ring at the\ndrawing-room bell. In reality, it was the forerunner of approaching\ncatastrophe--the formidable herald of the end.\n\nIt was Magdalen's business to answer the bell. On reaching the\ndrawing-room door, she knocked as usual. There was no reply. After again\nknocking, and again receiving no answer, she ventured into the room, and\nwas instantly met by a current of cold air flowing full on her face. The\nheavy sliding door in the opposite wall was pushed back, and the Arctic\natmosphere of Freeze-your-Bones was pouring unhindered into the empty\nroom.\n\nShe waited near the door, doubtful what to do next; it was certainly\nthe drawing-room bell that had rung, and no other. She waited, looking\nthrough the open doorway opposite, down the wilderness of the dismantled\nHall.\n\nA little consideration satisfied her that it would be best to go\ndownstairs again, and wait there for a second summons from the bell.\nOn turning to leave the room, she happened to look back once more, and\nexactly at that moment she saw the door open at the opposite extremity\nof the Banqueting-Hall--the door leading into the first of the\napartments in the east wing. A tall man came out, wearing his great coat\nand his hat, and rapidly approached the drawing-room. His gait betrayed\nhim, while he was still too far off for his features to be seen. Before\nhe was quite half-way across the Hall, Magdalen had recognized--the\nadmiral.\n\nHe looked, not irritated only, but surprised as well, at finding his\nparlor-maid waiting for him in the drawing-room, and inquired, sharply\nand suspiciously, what she wanted there? Magdalen replied that she had\ncome there to answer the bell. His face cleared a little when he heard\nthe explanation. \"Yes, yes; to be sure,\" he said. \"I did ring, and\nthen I forgot it.\" He pulled the sliding door back into its place as he\nspoke. \"Coals,\" he resumed, impatiently, pointing to the empty scuttle.\n\"I rang for coals.\"\n\nMagdalen went back to the kitchen regions. After communicating the\nadmiral's order to the servant whose special duty it was to attend to\nthe fires, she returned to the pantry, and, gently closing the door, sat\ndown alone to think.\n\nIt had been her impression in the drawing-room--and it was her\nimpression still--that she had accidentally surprised Admiral Bartram on\na visit to the east rooms, which, for some urgent reason of his own, he\nwished to keep a secret. Haunted day and night by the one dominant idea\nthat now possessed her, she leaped all logical difficulties at a bound,\nand at once associated the suspicion of a secret proceeding on the\nadmiral's part with the kindred suspicion which pointed to him as the\ndepositary of the Secret Trust. Up to this time it had been her settled\nbelief that he kept all his important documents in one or other of the\nsuite of rooms which he happened to be occupying for the time being.\nWhy--she now asked herself, with a sudden distrust of the conclusion\nwhich had hitherto satisfied her mind--why might he not lock some of\nthem up in the other rooms as well? The remembrance of the keys still\nconcealed in their hiding-place in her room sharpened her sense of the\nreasonableness of this new view. With one unimportant exception, those\nkeys had all failed when she tried them in the rooms on the north side\nof the house. Might they not succeed with the cabinets and cupboards in\nthe east rooms, on which she had never tried them, or thought of trying\nthem, yet? If there was a chance, however small, of turning them to\nbetter account than she had turned them thus far, it was a chance to be\ntried. If there was a possibility, however remote, that the Trust might\nbe hidden in any one of the locked repositories in the east wing, it was\na possibility to be put to the test. When? Her own experience answered\nthe question. At the time when no prying eyes were open, and no\naccidents were to be feared--when the house was quiet--in the dead of\nnight.\n\nShe knew enough of her changed self to dread the enervating influence of\ndelay. She determined to run the risk headlong that night.\n\nMore blunders escaped her when dinner-time came; the admiral's\ncriticisms on her waiting at table were sharper than ever. His hardest\nwords inflicted no pain on her; she scarcely heard him--her mind was\ndull to every sense but the sense of the coming trial. The evening which\nhad passed slowly to her on the night of her first experiment with\nthe keys passed quickly now. When bed-time came, bed-time took her by\nsurprise.\n\nShe waited longer on this occasion than she had waited before. The\nadmiral was at home; he might alter his mind and go downstairs again,\nafter he had gone up to his room; he might have forgotten something in\nthe library and might return to fetch it. Midnight struck from the clock\nin the servants' hall before she ventured out of her room, with the keys\nagain in her pocket, with the candle again in her hand.\n\nAt the first of the stairs on which she set her foot to descend, an\nall-mastering hesitation, an unintelligible shrinking from some peril\nunknown, seized her on a sudden. She waited, and reasoned with herself.\nShe had recoiled from no sacrifices, she had yielded to no fears, in\ncarrying out the stratagem by which she had gained admission to St.\nCrux; and now, when the long array of difficulties at the outset had\nbeen patiently conquered, now, when by sheer force of resolution the\nstarting-point was gained, she hesitated to advance. \"I shrank from\nnothing to get here,\" she said to herself. \"What madness possesses me\nthat I shrink now?\"\n\nEvery pulse in her quickened at the thought, with an animating shame\nthat nerved her to go on. She descended the stairs, from the third floor\nto the second, from the second to the first, without trusting herself\nto pause again within easy reach of her own room. In another minute, she\nhad reached the end of the corridor, had crossed the vestibule, and had\nentered the drawing-room. It was only when her grasp was on the heavy\nbrass handle of the sliding door--it was only at the moment before\nshe pushed the door back--that she waited to take breath. The\nBanqueting-Hall was close on the other side of the wooden partition\nagainst which she stood; her excited imagination felt the death-like\nchill of it flowing over her already.\n\nShe pushed back the sliding door a few inches--and stopped in momentary\nalarm. When the admiral had closed it in her presence that day, she had\nheard no noise. When old Mazey had opened it to show her the rooms in\nthe east wing, she had heard no noise. Now, in the night silence, she\nnoticed for the first time that the door made a sound--a dull, rushing\nsound, like the wind.\n\nShe roused herself, and pushed it further back--pushed it halfway into\nthe hollow chamber in the wall constructed to receive it. She advanced\nboldly into the gap, and met the night view of the Banqueting-Hall face\nto face.\n\nThe moon was rounding the southern side of the house. Her paling beams\nstreamed through the nearer windows, and lay in long strips of slanting\nlight on the marble pavement of the Hall. The black shadows of the\npediments between each window, alternating with the strips of light,\nheightened the wan glare of the moonshine on the floor. Toward its lower\nend, the Hall melted mysteriously into darkness. The ceiling was lost to\nview; the yawning fire-place, the overhanging mantel-piece, the long\nrow of battle pictures above, were all swallowed up in night. But one\nvisible object was discernible, besides the gleaming windows and the\nmoon-striped floor. Midway in the last and furthest of the strips of\nlight, the tripod rose erect on its gaunt black legs, like a monster\ncalled to life by the moon--a monster rising through the light, and\nmelting invisibly into the upper shadows of the Hall. Far and near, all\nsound lay dead, drowned in the stagnant cold. The soothing hush of night\nwas awful here. The deep abysses of darkness hid abysses of silence more\nimmeasurable still.\n\nShe stood motionless in the door-way, with straining eyes, with\nstraining ears. She looked for some moving thing, she listened for\nsome rising sound, and looked and listened in vain. A quick ceaseless\nshivering ran through her from head to foot. The shivering of fear, or\nthe shivering of cold? The bare doubt roused her resolute will. \"Now,\"\nshe thought, advancing a step through the door-way, \"or never! I'll\ncount the strips of moonlight three times over, and cross the Hall.\"\n\n\"One, two, three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. One, two,\nthree, four, five.\"\n\nAs the final number passed her lips at the third time of counting, she\ncrossed the Hall. Looking for nothing, listening for nothing, one hand\nholding the candle, the other mechanically grasping the folds of her\ndress, she sped, ghost-like, down the length of the ghostly place. She\nreached the door of the first of the eastern rooms, opened it, and ran\nin. The sudden relief of attaining a refuge, the sudden entrance into a\nnew atmosphere, overpowered her for the moment. She had just time to\nput the candle safely on a table before she dropped giddy and breathless\ninto the nearest chair.\n\nLittle by little she felt the rest quieting her. In a few minutes she\nbecame conscious of the triumph of having won her way to the east\nrooms. In a few minutes she was strong enough to rise from the chair, to\ntake the keys from her pocket, and to look round her.\n\nThe first objects of furniture in the room which attracted her attention\nwere an old bureau of carved oak, and a heavy buhl table with a cabinet\nattached. She tried the bureau first; it looked the likeliest receptacle\nfor papers of the two. Three of the keys proved to be of a size to enter\nthe lock, but none of them would turn it. The bureau was unassailable.\nShe left it, and paused to trim the wick of the candle before she tried\nthe buhl cabinet next.\n\nAt the moment when she raised her hand to the candle, she heard the\nstillness of the Banqueting-Hall shudder with the terror of a sound--a\nsound faint and momentary, like the distant rushing of the wind.\n\nThe sliding door in the drawing-room had moved.\n\nWhich way had it moved? Had an unknown hand pushed it back in its socket\nfurther than she had pushed it, or pulled it to again, and closed it?\nThe horror of being shut out all night, by some undiscoverable agency,\nfrom the life of the house, was stronger in her than the horror of\nlooking across the Banqueting-Hall. She made desperately for the door of\nthe room.\n\nIt had fallen to silently after her when she had come in, but it was not\nclosed. She pulled it open, and looked.\n\nThe sight that met her eyes rooted her, panic-stricken, to the spot.\n\nClose to the first of the row of windows, counting from the\ndrawing-room, and full in the gleam of it, she saw a solitary figure. It\nstood motionless, rising out of the furthest strip of moonlight on the\nfloor. As she looked, it suddenly disappeared. In another instant she\nsaw it again, in the second strip of moonlight--lost it again--saw it in\nthe third strip--lost it once more--and saw it in the fourth. Moment by\nmoment it advanced, now mysteriously lost in the shadow, now suddenly\nvisible again in the light, until it reached the fifth and nearest strip\nof moonlight. There it paused, and strayed aside slowly to the middle of\nthe Hall. It stopped at the tripod, and stood, shivering audibly in the\nsilence, with its hands raised over the dead ashes, in the action of\nwarming them at a fire. It turned back again, moving down the path of\nthe moonlight, stopped at the fifth window, turned once more, and came\non softly through the shadow straight to the place where Magdalen stood.\n\nHer voice was dumb, her will was helpless. Every sense in her but the\nseeing sense was paralyzed. The seeing sense--held fast in the fetters\nof its own terror--looked unchangeably straightforward, as it had looked\nfrom the first. There she stood in the door-way, full in the path of the\nfigure advancing on her through the shadow, nearer and nearer, step by\nstep.\n\nIt came close.\n\nThe bonds of horror that held her burst asunder when it was within\narm's-length. She started back. The light of the candle on the table\nfell full on its face, and showed her--Admiral Bartram.\n\nA long, gray dressing-gown was wrapped round him. His head was\nuncovered; his feet were bare. In his left hand he carried his little\nbasket of keys. He passed Magdalen slowly, his lips whispering without\nintermission, his open eyes staring straight before him with the glassy\nstare of death. His eyes revealed to her the terrifying truth. He was\nwalking in his sleep.\n\nThe terror of seeing him as she saw him now was not the terror she\nhad felt when her eyes first lighted on him--an apparition in the\nmoon-light, a specter in the ghostly Hall. This time she could struggle\nagainst the shock; she could feel the depth of her own fear.\n\nHe passed her, and stopped in the middle of the room. Magdalen ventured\nnear enough to him to be within reach of his voice as he muttered to\nhimself. She ventured nearer still, and heard the name of her dead\nhusband fall distinctly from the sleep-walker's lips.\n\n\"Noel!\" he said, in the low monotonous tones of a dreamer talking in his\nsleep, \"my good fellow, Noel, take it back again! It worries me day and\nnight. I don't know where it's safe; I don't know where to put it. Take\nit back, Noel--take it back!\"\n\nAs those words escaped him, he walked to the buhl cabinet. He sat down\nin the chair placed before it, and searched in the basket among his\nkeys. Magdalen softly followed him, and stood behind his chair, waiting\nwith the candle in her hand. He found the key, and unlocked the cabinet.\nWithout an instant's hesitation, he drew out a drawer, the second of a\nrow. The one thing in the drawer was a folded letter. He removed it, and\nput it down before him on the table. \"Take it back, Noel!\" he repeated,\nmechanically; \"take it back!\"\n\nMagdalen looked over his shoulder and read these lines, traced in her\nhusband's handwriting, at the top of the letter: _To be kept in your own\npossession, and to be opened by yourself only on the day of my decease.\nNoel Vanstone._ She saw the words plainly, with the admiral's name and\nthe admiral's address written under them.\n\nThe Trust within reach of her hand! The Trust traced to its hiding-place\nat last!\n\nShe took one step forward, to steal round his chair and to snatch the\nletter from the table. At the instant when she moved, he took it up once\nmore, locked the cabinet, and, rising, turned and faced her.\n\nIn the impulse of the moment, she stretched out her hand toward the hand\nin which he held the letter. The yellow candle-light fell full on him.\nThe awful death-in-life of his face--the mystery of the sleeping body,\nmoving in unconscious obedience to the dreaming mind--daunted her. Her\nhand trembled, and dropped again at her side.\n\nHe put the key of the cabinet back in the basket, and crossed the room\nto the bureau, with the basket in one hand and the letter in the other.\nMagdalen set the candle on the table again, and watched him. As he had\nopened the cabinet, so he now opened the bureau. Once more Magdalen\nstretched out her hand, and once more she recoiled before the mystery\nand the terror of his sleep. He put the letter in a drawer at the back\nof the bureau, and closed the heavy oaken lid again. \"Yes,\" he said.\n\"Safer there, as you say, Noel--safer there.\" So he spoke. So, time\nafter time, the words that betrayed him revealed the dead man living and\nspeaking again in the dream.\n\nHad he locked the bureau? Magdalen had not heard the lock turn. As he\nslowly moved away, walking back once more toward the middle of the room,\nshe tried the lid. It was locked. That discovery made, she looked to see\nwhat he was doing next. He was leaving the room again, with the basket\nof keys in his hand. When her first glance overtook him, he was crossing\nthe threshold of the door.\n\nSome inscrutable fascination possessed her, some mysterious attraction\ndrew her after him, in spite of herself. She took up the candle and\nfollowed him mechanically, as if she too were walking in her sleep.\nOne behind the other, in slow and noiseless progress, they crossed\nthe Banqueting-Hall. One behind the other, they passed through the\ndrawing-room, and along the corridor, and up the stairs. She followed\nhim to his own door. He went in, and shut it behind him softly. She\nstopped, and looked toward the truckle-bed. It was pushed aside at the\nfoot, some little distance away from the bedroom door. Who had moved it?\nShe held the candle close and looked toward the pillow, with a sudden\ncuriosity and a sudden doubt.\n\nThe truckle-bed was empty.\n\nThe discovery startled her for the moment, and for the moment only.\nPlain as the inferences were to be drawn from it, she never drew them.\nHer mind, slowly recovering the exercise of its faculties, was still\nunder the influence of the earlier and the deeper impressions produced\non it. Her mind followed the admiral into his room, as her body had\nfollowed him across the Banqueting-Hall.\n\nHad he lain down again in his bed? Was he still asleep? She listened at\nthe door. Not a sound was audible in the room. She tried the door, and,\nfinding it not locked, softly opened it a few inches and listened again.\nThe rise and fall of his low, regular breathing instantly caught her\near. He was still asleep.\n\nShe went into the room, and, shading the candle-light with her hand,\napproached the bedside to look at him. The dream was past; the old man's\nsleep was deep and peaceful; his lips were still; his quiet hand was\nlaid over the coverlet in motionless repose. He lay with his face turned\ntoward the right-hand side of the bed. A little table stood there within\nreach of his hand. Four objects were placed on it; his candle, his\nmatches, his customary night drink of lemonade, and his basket of keys.\n\nThe idea of possessing herself of his keys that night (if an opportunity\noffered when the basket was not in his hand) had first crossed her mind\nwhen she saw him go into his room. She had lost it again for the moment,\nin the surprise of discovering the empty truckle-bed. She now recovered\nit the instant the table attracted her attention. It was useless to\nwaste time in trying to choose the one key wanted from the rest--the one\nkey was not well enough known to her to be readily identified. She took\nall the keys from the table, in the basket as they lay, and noiselessly\nclosed the door behind her on leaving the room.\n\nThe truckle-bed, as she passed it, obtruded itself again on\nher attention, and forced her to think of it. After a moment's\nconsideration, she moved the foot of the bed back to its customary\nposition across the door. Whether he was in the house or out of it, the\nveteran might return to his deserted post at any moment. If he saw the\nbed moved from its usual place, he might suspect something wrong, he\nmight rouse his master, and the loss of the keys might be discovered.\n\nNothing happened as she descended the stairs, nothing happened as she\npassed along the corridor; the house was as silent and as solitary as\never. She crossed the Banqueting-Hall this time without hesitation; the\nevents of the night had hardened her mind against all imaginary terrors.\n\"Now, I have got it!\" she whispered to herself, in an irrepressible\noutburst of exaltation, as she entered the first of the east rooms and\nput her candle on the top of the old bureau.\n\nEven yet there was a trial in store for her patience. Some minutes\nelapsed--minutes that seemed hours--before she found the right key and\nraised the lid of the bureau. At last she drew out the inner drawer! At\nlast she had the letter in her hand!\n\nIt had been sealed, but the seal was broken. She opened it on the spot,\nto make sure that she had actually possessed herself of the Trust before\nleaving the room. The end of the letter was the first part of it she\nturned to. It came to its conclusion high on the third page, and it was\nsigned by Noel Vanstone. Below the name these lines were added in the\nadmiral's handwriting:\n\n\n\"This letter was received by me at the same time with the will of my\nfriend, Noel Vanstone. In the event of my death, without leaving any\nother directions respecting it, I beg my nephew and my executors\nto understand that I consider the requests made in this document as\nabsolutely binding on me.\n\n\"ARTHUR EVERARD BARTRAM.\"\n\n\nShe left those lines unread. She just noticed that they were not in Noel\nVanstone's handwriting; and, passing over them instantly, as immaterial\nto the object in view, turned the leaves of the letter, and transferred\nher attention to the opening sentences on the first page. She read these\nwords:\n\n\n\"DEAR ADMIRAL BARTRAM--When you open my Will (in which you are named my\nsole executor), you will find that I have bequeathed the whole residue\nof my estate--after payment of one legacy of five thousand pounds--to\nyourself. It is the purpose of my letter to tell you privately what the\nobject is for which I have left you the fortune which is now placed in\nyour hands.\n\n\"I beg you to consider this large legacy as intended--\"\n\n\nShe had proceeded thus far with breathless curiosity and interest,\nwhen her attention suddenly failed her. Something--she was too deeply\nabsorbed to know what--had got between her and the letter. Was it a\nsound in the Banqueting-Hall again? She looked over her shoulder at the\ndoor behind her, and listened. Nothing was to be heard, nothing was to\nbe seen. She returned to the letter.\n\nThe writing was cramped and close. In her impatient curiosity to read\nmore, she failed to find the lost place again. Her eyes, attracted by a\nblot, lighted on a sentence lower in the page than the sentence at which\nshe had left off. The first three words she saw riveted her attention\nanew--they were the first words she had met with in the letter which\ndirectly referred to George Bartram. In the sudden excitement of that\ndiscovery, she read the rest of the sentence eagerly, before she made\nany second attempt to return to the lost place:\n\n\n\"If your nephew fails to comply with these conditions--that is to say,\nif, being either a bachelor or a widower at the time of my decease, he\nfails to marry in all respects as I have here instructed him to marry,\nwithin six calendar months from that time--it is my desire that he shall\nnot receive--\"\n\n\nShe had read to that point, to that last word and no further, when a\nhand passed suddenly from behind her between the letter and her eye, and\ngripped her fast by the wrist in an instant.\n\nShe turned with a shriek of terror, and found herself face to face with\nold Mazey.\n\nThe veteran's eyes were bloodshot; his hand was heavy; his list slippers\nwere twisted crookedly on his feet; and his body swayed to and fro on\nhis widely parted legs. If he had tested his condition that night by\nthe unfailing criterion of the model ship, he must have inevitably\npronounced sentence on himself in the usual form: \"Drunk again, Mazey;\ndrunk again.\"\n\n\"You young Jezebel!\" said the old sailor, with a leer on one side of his\nface, and a frown on the other. \"The next time you take to night-walking\nin the neighborhood of Freeze-your-Bones, use those sharp eyes of yours\nfirst, and make sure there's nobody else night walking in the garden\noutside. Drop it, Jezebel! drop it!\"\n\nKeeping fast hold of Magdalen's arm with one hand, he took the letter\nfrom her with the other, put it back into the open drawer, and locked\nthe bureau. She never struggled with him, she never spoke. Her energy\nwas gone; her powers of resistance were crushed. The terrors of that\nhorrible night, following one close on the other in reiterated shocks,\nhad struck her down at last. She yielded as submissively, she trembled\nas helplessly, as the weakest woman living.\n\nOld Mazey dropped her arm, and pointed with drunken solemnity to a chair\nin an inner corner of the room. She sat down, still without uttering a\nword. The veteran (breathing very hard over it) steadied himself on both\nelbows against the slanting top of the bureau, and from that commanding\nposition addressed Magdalen once more.\n\n\"Come and be locked up!\" said old Mazey, wagging his venerable head with\njudicial severity. \"There'll be a court of inquiry to-morrow morning,\nand I'm witness--worse luck!--I'm witness. You young jade, you've\ncommitted burglary--that's what you've done. His honor the admiral's\nkeys stolen; his honor the admiral's desk ransacked; and his honor the\nadmiral's private letters broke open. Burglary! Burglary! Come and be\nlocked up!\" He slowly recovered an upright position, with the assistance\nof his hands, backed by the solid resisting power of the bureau; and\nlapsed into lachrymose soliloquy. \"Who'd have thought it?\" said old\nMazey, paternally watering at the eyes. \"Take the outside of her, and\nshe's as straight as a poplar; take the inside of her, and she's as\ncrooked as Sin. Such a fine-grown girl, too. What a pity! what a pity!\"\n\n\"Don't hurt me!\" said Magdalen, faintly, as old Mazey staggered up\nto the chair, and took her by the wrist again. \"I'm frightened, Mr.\nMazey--I'm dreadfully frightened.\"\n\n\"Hurt you?\" repeated the veteran. \"I'm a deal too fond of you--and more\nshame for me at my age!--to hurt you. If I let go of your wrist, will\nyou walk straight before me, where I can see you all the way? Will you\nbe a good girl, and walk straight up to your own door?\"\n\nMagdalen gave the promise required of her--gave it with an eager longing\nto reach the refuge of her room. She rose, and tried to take the candle\nfrom the bureau, but old Mazey's cunning hand was too quick for\nher. \"Let the candle be,\" said the veteran, winking in momentary\nforgetfulness of his responsible position. \"You're a trifle quicker on\nyour legs than I am, my dear, and you might leave me in the lurch, if I\ndon't carry the light.\"\n\nThey returned to the inhabited side of the house. Staggering after\nMagdalen, with the basket of keys in one hand and the candle in the\nother, old Mazey sorrowfully compared her figure with the straightness\nof the poplar, and her disposition with the crookedness of Sin, all\nthe way across \"Freeze-your-Bones,\" and all the way upstairs to her own\ndoor. Arrived at that destination, he peremptorily refused to give\nher the candle until he had first seen her safely inside the room. The\nconditions being complied with, he resigned the light with one hand, and\nmade a dash with the other at the key, drew it from the inside of\nthe lock, and instantly closed the door. Magdalen heard him outside\nchuckling over his own dexterity, and fitting the key into the lock\nagain with infinite difficulty. At last he secured the door, with a\ndeep grunt of relief. \"There she is safe!\" Magdalen heard him say, in\nregretful soliloquy. \"As fine a girl as ever I sat eyes on. What a pity!\nwhat a pity!\"\n\nThe last sounds of his voice died out in the distance; and she was left\nalone in her room.\n\n\nHolding fast by the banister, old Mazey made his way down to the\ncorridor on the second floor, in which a night light was always burning.\nHe advanced to the truckle-bed, and, steadying himself against the\nopposite wall, looked at it attentively. Prolonged contemplation of his\nown resting-place for the night apparently failed to satisfy him.\nHe shook his head ominously, and, taking from the side-pocket of his\ngreat-coat a pair of old patched slippers, surveyed them with an aspect\nof illimitable doubt. \"I'm all abroad to-night,\" he mumbled to himself.\n\"Troubled in my mind--that's what it is--troubled in my mind.\"\n\nThe old patched slippers and the veteran's existing perplexities\nhappened to be intimately associated one with the other, in the relation\nof cause and effect. The slippers belonged to the admiral, who had taken\none of his unreasonable fancies to this particular pair, and who still\npersisted in wearing them long after they were unfit for his service.\nEarly that afternoon old Mazey had taken the slippers to the village\ncobbler to get them repaired on the spot, before his master called for\nthem the next morning; he sat superintending the progress and completion\nof the work until evening came, when he and the cobbler betook\nthemselves to the village inn to drink each other's healths at parting.\nThey had prolonged this social ceremony till far into the night, and\nthey had parted, as a necessary consequence, in a finished and perfect\nstate of intoxication on either side.\n\nIf the drinking-bout had led to no other result than those night\nwanderings in the grounds of St. Crux, which had shown old Mazey\nthe light in the east windows, his memory would unquestionably have\npresented it to him the next morning in the aspect of one of the\npraiseworthy achievements of his life. But another consequence had\nsprung from it, which the old sailor now saw dimly, through the\ninterposing bewilderment left in his brain by the drink. He had\ncommitted a breach of discipline, and a breach of trust. In plainer\nwords, he had deserted his post.\n\nThe one safeguard against Admiral Bartram's constitutional tendency to\nsomnambulism was the watch and ward which his faithful old servant kept\noutside his door. No entreaties had ever prevailed on him to submit to\nthe usual precaution taken in such cases. He peremptorily declined to\nbe locked into his room; he even ignored his own liability, whenever\na dream disturbed him, to walk in his sleep. Over and over again,\nold Mazey had been roused by the admiral's attempts to push past the\ntruckle-bed, or to step over it, in his sleep; and over and over again,\nwhen the veteran had reported the fact the next morning, his master had\ndeclined to believe him. As the old sailor now stood, staring in vacant\ninquiry at the bed-chamber door, these incidents of the past rose\nconfusedly on his memory, and forced on him the serious question whether\nthe admiral had left his room during the earlier hours of the night. If\nby any mischance the sleep-walking fit had seized him, the slippers in\nold Mazey's hand pointed straight to the conclusion that followed--his\nmaster must have passed barefoot in the cold night over the stone stairs\nand passages of St. Crux. \"Lord send he's been quiet!\" muttered\nold Mazey, daunted, bold as he was and drunk as he was, by the bare\ncontemplation of that prospect. \"If his honor's been walking to-night,\nit will be the death of him!\"\n\nHe roused himself for the moment by main force--strong in his dog-like\nfidelity to the admiral, though strong in nothing else--and fought off\nthe stupor of the drink. He looked at the bed with steadier eyes and\na clearer mind. Magdalen's precaution in returning it to its customary\nposition presented it to him necessarily in the aspect of a bed which\nhad never been moved from its place. He next examined the counterpane\ncarefully. Not the faintest vestige appeared of the indentation which\nmust have been left by footsteps passing over it. There was the plain\nevidence before him--the evidence recognizable at last by his own\nbewildered eyes--that the admiral had never moved from his room.\n\n\"I'll take the Pledge to-morrow!\" mumbled old Mazey, in an outburst of\ngrateful relief. The next moment the fumes of the liquor floated back\ninsidiously over his brain; and the veteran, returning to his customary\nremedy, paced the passage in zigzag as usual, and kept watch on the deck\nof an imaginary ship.\n\n\nSoon after sunrise, Magdalen suddenly heard the grating of the key\nfrom outside in the lock of the door. The door opened, and old Mazey\nre-appeared on the threshold. The first fever of his intoxication had\ncooled, with time, into a mild, penitential glow. He breathed harder\nthan ever, in a succession of low growls, and wagged his venerable head\nat his own delinquencies without intermission.\n\n\"How are you now, you young land-shark in petticoats?\" inquired the old\nsailor. \"Has your conscience been quiet enough to let you go to sleep?\"\n\n\"I have not slept,\" said Magdalen, drawing back from him in doubt of\nwhat he might do next. \"I have no remembrance of what happened after you\nlocked the door--I think I must have fainted. Don't frighten me again,\nMr. Mazey! I feel miserably weak and ill. What do you want?\"\n\n\"I want to say something serious,\" replied old Mazey, with impenetrable\nsolemnity. \"It's been on my mind to come here and make a clean breast of\nit, for the last hour or more. Mark my words, young woman. I'm going to\ndisgrace myself.\"\n\nMagdalen drew further and further back, and looked at him in rising\nalarm.\n\n\"I know my duty to his honor the admiral,\" proceeded old Mazey, waving\nhis hand drearily in the direction of his master's door. \"But, try\nas hard as I may, I can't find it in my heart, you young jade, to be\nwitness against you. I liked the make of you (especially about the\nwaist) when you first came into the house, and I can't help liking the\nmake of you still--though you _have_ committed burglary, and though you\n_are_ as crooked as Sin. I've cast the eyes of indulgence on fine-grown\ngirls all my life, and it's too late in the day to cast the eyes of\nseverity on 'em now. I'm seventy-seven, or seventy-eight, I don't\nrightly know which. I'm a battered old hulk, with my seams opening, and\nmy pumps choked, and the waters of Death powering in on me as fast as\nthey can. I'm as miserable a sinner as you'll meet with anywhere in\nthese parts--Thomas Nagle, the cobbler, only excepted; and he's worse\nthan I am, for he's the younger of the two, and he ought to know better.\nBut the long and short or it is, I shall go down to my grave with an\neye of indulgence for a fine-grown girl. More shame for me, you young\nJezebel--more shame for me!\"\n\nThe veteran's unmanageable eyes began to leer again in spite of him,\nas he concluded his harangue in these terms: the last reserves of\nausterity left in his face entrenched themselves dismally round the\ncorners of his mouth. Magdalen approached him again, and tried to speak.\nHe solemnly motioned her back with another dreary wave of his hand.\n\n\"No carneying!\" said old Mazey; \"I'm bad enough already, without that.\nIt's my duty to make my report to his honor the admiral, and I\n_will_ make it. But if you like to give the house the slip before the\nburglary's reported, and the court of inquiry begins, I'll disgrace\nmyself by letting you go. It's market morning at Ossory, and Dawkes will\nbe driving the light cart over in a quarter of an hour's time. Dawkes\nwill take you if I ask him. I know my duty--my duty is to turn the key\non you, and see Dawkes damned first. But I can't find it in my heart to\nbe hard on a fine girl like you. It's bred in the bone, and it wunt come\nout of the flesh. More shame for me, I tell you again--more shame for\nme!\"\n\nThe proposal thus strangely and suddenly presented to her took Magdalen\ncompletely by surprise. She had been far too seriously shaken by the\nevents of the night to be capable of deciding on any subject at a\nmoment's notice. \"You are very good to me, Mr. Mazey,\" she said. \"May I\nhave a minute by myself to think?\"\n\n\"Yes, you may,\" replied the veteran, facing about forthwith and leaving\nthe room. \"They're all alike,\" proceeded old Mazey, with his head still\nrunning on the sex. \"Whatever you offer 'em, they always want something\nmore. Tall and short, native and foreign, sweethearts and wives, they're\nall alike!\"\n\nLeft by herself, Magdalen reached her decision with far less difficulty\nthan she had anticipated.\n\nIf she remained in the house, there were only two courses before\nher--to charge old Mazey with speaking under the influence of a drunken\ndelusion, or to submit to circumstances. Though she owed to the old\nsailor her defeat in the very hour of success, his consideration for\nher at that moment forbade the idea of defending herself at his\nexpense--even supposing, what was in the last degree improbable, that\nthe defense would be credited. In the second of the two cases (the\ncase of submission to circumstances), but one result could be\nexpected--instant dismissal, and perhaps discovery as well. What object\nwas to be gained by braving that degradation--by leaving the house\npublicly disgraced in the eyes of the servants who had hated and\ndistrusted her from the first? The accident which had literally\nsnatched the Trust from her possession when she had it in her hand was\nirreparable. The one apparent compensation under the disaster--in other\nwords, the discovery that the Trust actually existed, and that George\nBartram's marriage within a given time was one of the objects contained\nin it--was a compensation which could only be estimated at its true\nvalue by placing it under the light of Mr. Loscombe's experience. Every\nmotive of which she was conscious was a motive which urged her to leave\nthe house secretly while the chance was at her disposal. She looked out\ninto the passage, and called softly to old Mazey to come back.\n\n\"I accept your offer thankfully, Mr. Mazey,\" she said. \"You don't know\nwhat hard measure you dealt out to me when you took that letter from my\nhand. But you did your duty, and I can be grateful to you for sparing me\nthis morning, hard as you were upon me last night. I am not such a bad\ngirl as you think me--I am not, indeed.\"\n\nOld Mazey dismissed the subject with another dreary wave of his hand.\n\n\"Let it be,\" said the veteran; \"let it be! It makes no difference, my\ngirl, to such an old rascal as I am. If you were fifty times worse than\nyou are, I should let you go all the same. Put on your bonnet and shawl,\nand come along. I'm a disgrace to myself and a warning to others--that's\nwhat I am. No luggage, mind! Leave all your rattle-traps behind you: to\nbe overhauled, if necessary, at his honor the admiral's discretion. I\ncan be hard enough on your boxes, you young Jezebel, if I can't be hard\non you.\"\n\nWith these words, old Mazey led the way out of the room. \"The less I see\nof her the better--especially about the waist,\" he said to himself, as\nhe hobbled downstairs with the help of the banisters.\n\nThe cart was standing in the back yard when they reached the lower\nregions of the house, and Dawkes (otherwise the farm-bailiff's man) was\nfastening the last buckle of the horse's harness. The hoar-frost of\nthe morning was still white in the shade. The sparkling points of it\nglistened brightly on the shaggy coats of Brutus and Cassius, as they\nidled about the yard, waiting, with steaming mouths and slowly wagging\ntails, to see the cart drive off. Old Mazey went out alone and used his\ninfluence with Dawkes, who, staring in stolid amazement, put a leather\ncushion on the cart-seat for his fellow-traveler. Shivering in the sharp\nmorning air, Magdalen waited, while the preliminaries of departure were\nin progress, conscious of nothing but a giddy bewilderment of thought,\nand a helpless suspension of feeling. The events of the night confused\nthemselves hideously with the trivial circumstances passing before her\neyes in the courtyard. She started with the sudden terror of the night\nwhen old Mazey re-appeared to summon her out to the cart. She trembled\nwith the helpless confusion of the night when the veteran cast the eyes\nof indulgence on her for the last time, and gave her a kiss on the cheek\nat parting. The next minute she felt him help her into the cart, and\npat her on the back. The next, she heard him tell her in a confidential\nwhisper that, sitting or standing, she was as straight as a poplar\neither way. Then there was a pause, in which nothing was said, and\nnothing done; and then the driver took the reins in hand and mounted to\nhis place.\n\nShe roused herself at the parting moment and looked back. The last sight\nshe saw at St. Crux was old Mazey wagging his head in the courtyard,\nwith his fellow-profligates, the dogs, keeping time to him with their\ntails. The last words she heard were the words in which the veteran paid\nhis farewell tribute to her charms:\n\n\"Burglary or no burglary,\" said old Mazey, \"she's a fine-grown girl, if\never there was a fine one yet. What a pity! what a pity!\"\n\nTHE END OF THE SEVENTH SCENE.\n\n\n\n\nBETWEEN THE SCENES.\n\nPROGRESS OF THE STORY THROUGH THE POST.\n\n\nI.\n\n_From George Bartram to Admiral Bartram._\n\n\"London, April 3d, 1848.\n\n\"MY DEAR UNCLE--One hasty line, to inform you of a temporary obstacle,\nwhich we neither of us anticipated when we took leave of each other at\nSt. Crux. While I was wasting the last days of the week at the Grange,\nthe Tyrrels must have been making their arrangements for leaving London.\nI have just come from Portland Place. The house is shut up, and the\nfamily (Miss Vanstone, of course, included) left England yesterday, to\npass the season in Paris.\n\n\"Pray don't let yourself be annoyed by this little check at starting.\nIt is of no serious importance whatever. I have got the address at which\nthe Tyrrels are living, and I mean to cross the Channel after them by\nthe mail to-night. I shall find my opportunity in Paris just as soon as\nI could have found it in London. The grass shall not grow under my feet,\nI promise you. For once in my life, I will take Time as fiercely by the\nforelock as if I was the most impetuous man in England; and, rely on\nit, the moment I know the result, you shall know the result, too.\nAffectionately yours,\n\n\"GEORGE BARTRAM.\"\n\n\nII.\n\n_From George Bartram to Miss Garth._\n\n\"Paris, April 13th.\n\n\"DEAR MISS GARTH--I have just written, with a heavy heart, to my uncle,\nand I think I owe it to your kind interest in me not to omit writing\nnext to you.\n\n\"You will feel for my disappointment, I am sure, when I tell you, in the\nfewest and plainest words, that Miss Vanstone has refused me.\n\n\"My vanity may have grievously misled me, but I confess I expected a\nvery different result. My vanity may be misleading me still; for I must\nacknowledge to you privately that I think Miss Vanstone was sorry to\nrefuse me. The reason she gave for her decision--no doubt a sufficient\nreason in her estimation--did not at the time, and does not now, seem\nsufficient to _me_. She spoke in the sweetest and kindest manner, but\nshe firmly declared that 'her family misfortunes' left her no honorable\nalternative--but to think of my own interests as I had not thought of\nthem myself--and gratefully to decline accepting my offer.\n\n\"She was so painfully agitated that I could not venture to plead my own\ncause as I might otherwise have pleaded it. At the first attempt I\nmade to touch the personal question, she entreated me to spare her, and\nabruptly left the room. I am still ignorant whether I am to interpret\nthe 'family misfortunes' which have set up this barrier between us, as\nmeaning the misfortune for which her parents alone are to blame, or\nthe misfortune of her having such a woman as Mrs. Noel Vanstone for her\nsister. In whichever of these circumstances the obstacle lies, it is\nno obstacle in my estimation. Can nothing remove it? Is there no hope?\nForgive me for asking these questions. I cannot bear up against my\nbitter disappointment. Neither she, nor you, nor any one but myself, can\nknow how I love her.\n\n\"Ever most truly yours,\n\n\"GEORGE BARTRAM.\n\n\"P. S.--I shall leave for England in a day or two, passing through\nLondon on my way to St. Crux. There are family reasons, connected with\nthe hateful subject of money, which make me look forward with anything\nbut pleasure to my next interview with my uncle. If you address your\nletter to Long's Hotel, it will be sure to reach me.\"\n\n\nIII.\n\n_From Miss Garth to George Bartram._\n\n\"Westmoreland House, April 16th.\n\n\"DEAR MR. BARTRAM--You only did me justice in supposing that your letter\nwould distress me. If you had supposed that it would make me excessively\nangry as well, you would not have been far wrong. I have no patience\nwith the pride and perversity of the young women of the present day.\n\n\"I have heard from Norah. It is a long letter, stating the particulars\nin full detail. I am now going to put all the confidence in your honor\nand your discretion which I really feel. For your sake, and for Norah's,\nI am going to let you know what the scruple really is which has misled\nher into the pride and folly of refusing you. I am old enough to speak\nout; and I can tell you, if she had only been wise enough to let her own\nwishes guide her, she would have said Yes--and gladly, too.\n\n\"The original cause of all the mischief is no less a person than your\nworthy uncle--Admiral Bartram.\n\n\"It seems that the admiral took it into his head (I suppose during your\nabsence) to go to London by himself and to satisfy some curiosity of his\nown about Norah by calling in Portland Place, under pretense of renewing\nhis old friendship with the Tyrrels. He came at luncheon-time, and saw\nNorah; and, from all I can hear, was apparently better pleased with her\nthan he expected or wished to be when he came into the house.\n\n\"So far, this is mere guess-work; but it is unluckily certain that he\nand Mrs. Tyrrel had some talk together alone when luncheon was over.\nYour name was not mentioned; but when their conversation fell on Norah,\nyou were in both their minds, of course. The admiral (doing her full\njustice personally) declared himself smitten with pity for her hard\nlot in life. The scandalous conduct of her sister must always stand (he\nfeared) in the way of her future advantage. Who could marry her, without\nfirst making it a condition that she and her sister were to be absolute\nstrangers to each other? And even then, the objection would remain--the\nserious objection to the husband's family--of being connected by\nmarriage with such a woman as Mrs. Noel Vanstone. It was very sad; it\nwas not the poor girl's fault, but it was none the less true that\nher sister was her rock ahead in life. So he ran on, with no real\nill-feeling toward Norah, but with an obstinate belief in his own\nprejudices which bore the aspect of ill-feeling, and which people with\nmore temper than judgment would be but too readily disposed to resent\naccordingly.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Mrs. Tyrrel is one of those people. She is an excellent,\nwarm-hearted woman, with a quick temper and very little judgment;\nstrongly attached to Norah, and heartily interested in Norah's welfare.\nFrom all I can learn, she first resented the expression of the admiral's\nopinion, in his presence, as worldly and selfish in the last degree;\nand then interpreted it, behind his back, as a hint to discourage his\nnephew's visits, which was a downright insult offered to a lady in her\nown house. This was foolish enough so far; but worse folly was to come.\n\n\"As soon as your uncle was gone, Mrs. Tyrrel, most unwisely and\nimproperly, sent for Norah, and, repeating the conversation that had\ntaken place, warned her of the reception she might expect from the man\nwho stood toward you in the position of a father, if she accepted an\noffer of marriage on your part. When I tell you that Norah's faithful\nattachment to her sister still remains unshaken, and that there lies\nhidden under her noble submission to the unhappy circumstances of her\nlife a proud susceptibility to slights of all kinds, which is deeply\nseated in her nature--you will understand the true motive of the refusal\nwhich has so naturally and so justly disappointed you. They are all\nthree equally to blame in this matter. Your uncle was wrong to state\nhis objections so roundly and inconsiderately as he did. Mrs. Tyrrel was\nwrong to let her temper get the better of her, and to suppose herself\ninsulted where no insult was intended. And Norah was wrong to place a\nscruple of pride, and a hopeless belief in her sister which no strangers\ncan be expected to share, above the higher claims of an attachment which\nmight have secured the happiness and the prosperity of her future life.\n\n\"But the mischief has been done. The next question is, can the harm be\nremedied?\n\n\"I hope and believe it can. My advice is this: Don't take No for an\nanswer. Give her time enough to reflect on what she has done, and to\nregret it (as I believe she will regret it) in secret; trust to my\ninfluence over her to plead your cause for you at every opportunity I\ncan find; wait patiently for the right moment, and ask her again. Men,\nbeing accustomed to act on reflection themselves, are a great deal too\napt to believe that women act on reflection, too. Women do nothing of\nthe sort. They act on impulse; and, in nine cases out of ten, they are\nheartily sorry for it afterward.\n\n\"In the meanwhile, you must help your own interests by inducing your\nuncle to alter his opinion, or at least to make the concession of\nkeeping his opinion to himself. Mrs. Tyrrel has rushed to the conclusion\nthat the harm he has done he did intentionally--which is as much as to\nsay, in so many words, that he had a prophetic conviction, when he came\ninto the house, of what she would do when he left it. My explanation of\nthe matter is a much simpler one. I believe that the knowledge of your\nattachment naturally aroused his curiosity to see the object of it, and\nthat Mrs. Tyrrel's injudicious praises of Norah irritated his objections\ninto openly declaring themselves. Anyway, your course lies equally plain\nbefore you. Use your influence over your uncle to persuade him into\nsetting matters right again; trust my settled resolution to see Norah\nyour wife before six months more are over our heads; and believe me,\nyour friend and well-wisher,\n\n\"HARRIET GARTH.\"\n\n\nIV.\n\n_From Mrs. Drake to George Bartram._\n\n\"St. Crux, April 17th.\n\n\"SIR--I direct these lines to the hotel you usually stay at in London,\nhoping that you may return soon enough from foreign parts to receive my\nletter without delay.\n\n\"I am sorry to say that some unpleasant events have taken place at St.\nCrux since you left it, and that my honored master, the admiral, is far\nfrom enjoying his usual good health. On both these accounts, I venture\nto write to you on my own responsibility, for I think your presence is\nneeded in the house.\n\n\"Early in the month a most regrettable circumstance took place. Our new\nparlor-maid was discovered by Mr. Mazey, at a late hour of the night\n(with her master's basket of keys in her possession), prying into the\nprivate documents kept in the east library. The girl removed herself\nfrom the house the next morning before we were any of us astir, and\nshe has not been heard of since. This event has annoyed and alarmed my\nmaster very seriously; and to make matters worse, on the day when the\ngirl's treacherous conduct was discovered, the admiral was seized with\nthe first symptoms of a severe inflammatory cold. He was not himself\naware, nor was any one else, how he had caught the chill. The doctor was\nsent for, and kept the inflammation down until the day before yesterday,\nwhen it broke out again, under circumstances which I am sure you will be\nsorry to hear, as I am truly sorry to write of them.\n\n\"On the date I have just mentioned--I mean the fifteenth of the\nmonth--my master himself informed me that he had been dreadfully\ndisappointed by a letter received from you, which had come in the\nmorning from foreign parts, and had brought him bad news. He did not\ntell me what the news was--but I have never, in all the years I have\npassed in the admiral's service, seen him so distressingly upset, and so\nunlike himself, as he was on that day. At night his uneasiness seemed\nto increase. He was in such a state of irritation that he could not bear\nthe sound of Mr. Mazey's hard breathing outside his door, and he laid\nhis positive orders on the old man to go into one of the bedrooms for\nthat night. Mr. Mazey, to his own great regret, was of course obliged to\nobey.\n\n\"Our only means of preventing the admiral from leaving his room in his\nsleep, if the fit unfortunately took him, being now removed, Mr. Mazey\nand I agreed to keep watch by turns through the night, sitting, with the\ndoor ajar, in one of the empty rooms near our master's bed-chamber.\nWe could think of nothing better to do than this, knowing he would not\nallow us to lock him in, and not having the door key in our possession,\neven if we could have ventured to secure him in his room without his\npermission. I kept watch for the first two hours, and then Mr. Mazey\ntook my place. After having been some little time in my own room, it\noccurred to me that the old man was hard of hearing, and that if his\neyes grew at all heavy in the night, his ears were not to be trusted to\nwarn him if anything happened. I slipped on my clothes again, and went\nback to Mr. Mazey. He was neither asleep nor awake--he was between the\ntwo. My mind misgave me, and I went on to the admiral's room. The door\nwas open, and the bed was empty.\n\n\"Mr. Mazey and I went downstairs instantly. We looked in all the north\nrooms, one after another, and found no traces of him. I thought of the\ndrawing-room next, and, being the more active of the two, went first to\nexamine it. The moment I turned the sharp corner of the passage, I saw\nmy master coming toward me through the open drawing-room door, asleep\nand dreaming, with his keys in his hands. The sliding door behind him\nwas open also; and the fear came to me then, and has remained with me\never since, that his dream had led him through the Banqueting-Hall into\nthe east rooms. We abstained from waking him, and followed his steps\nuntil he returned of his own accord to his bed-chamber. The next\nmorning, I grieve to say, all the bad symptoms came back; and none of\nthe remedies employed have succeeded in getting the better of them yet.\nBy the doctor's advice, we refrained from telling the admiral what had\nhappened. He is still under the impression that he passed the night as\nusual in his own room.\n\n\"I have been careful to enter into all the particulars of this\nunfortunate accident, because neither Mr. Mazey nor myself desire to\nscreen ourselves from blame, if blame we have deserved. We both acted\nfor the best, and we both beg and pray you will consider our responsible\nsituation, and come as soon as possible to St. Crux. Our honored master\nis very hard to manage; and the doctor thinks, as we do, that your\npresence is wanted in the house.\n\n\"I remain, sir, with Mr. Mazey's respects and my own, your humble\nservant,\n\n\"SOPHIA DRAKE.\"\n\n\nV.\n\n_From George Bartram to Miss Garth._\n\n\"St. Crux, April 22d.\n\n\"DEAR MISS GARTH--Pray excuse my not thanking you sooner for your kind\nand consoling letter. We are in sad trouble at St. Crux. Any little\nirritation I might have felt at my poor uncle's unlucky interference\nin Portland Place is all forgotten in the misfortune of his serious\nillness. He is suffering from internal inflammation, produced by cold;\nand symptoms have shown themselves which are dangerous at his age. A\nphysician from London is now in the house. You shall hear more in a few\ndays. Meantime, believe me, with sincere gratitude,\n\n\"Yours most truly,\n\n\"GEORGE BARTRAM.\"\n\n\nVI.\n\n_From Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn Fields, May 6th.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--I have unexpectedly received some information which is\nof the most vital importance to your interests. The news of Admiral\nBartram's death has reached me this morning. He expired at his own\nhouse, on the fourth of the present month.\n\n\"This event at once disposes of the considerations which I had\npreviously endeavored to impress on you, in relation to your\ndiscovery at St. Crux. The wisest course we can now follow is to open\ncommunications at once with the executors of the deceased gentleman;\naddressing them through the medium of the admiral's legal adviser, in\nthe first instance.\n\n\"I have dispatched a letter this day to the solicitor in question. It\nsimply warns him that we have lately become aware of the existence of a\nprivate Document, controlling the deceased gentleman in his use of the\nlegacy devised to him by Mr. Noel Vanstone's will. My letter assumes\nthat the document will be easily found among the admiral's papers; and\nit mentions that I am the solicitor appointed by Mrs. Noel Vanstone to\nreceive communications on her behalf. My object in taking this step is\nto cause a search to be instituted for the Trust--in the very probable\nevent of the executors not having met with it yet-before the usual\nmeasures are adopted for the administration of the admiral's estate.\nWe will threaten legal proceedings, if we find that the object does not\nsucceed. But I anticipate no such necessity. Admiral Bartram's executors\nmust be men of high standing and position; and they will do justice to\nyou and to themselves in this matter by looking for the Trust.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, you will naturally ask, 'What are our\nprospects when the document is found?' Our prospects have a bright side\nand a dark side. Let us take the bright side to begin with.\n\n\"What do we actually know?\n\n\"We know, first, that the Trust does really exist. Secondly, that there\nis a provision in it relating to the marriage of Mr. George Bartram in\na given time. Thirdly, that the time (six months from the date of your\nhusband's death) expired on the third of this month. Fourthly, that Mr.\nGeorge Bartram (as I have found out by inquiry, in the absence of any\npositive information on the subject possessed by yourself) is, at the\npresent moment, a single man. The conclusion naturally follows, that the\nobject contemplated by the Trust, in this case, is an object that has\nfailed.\n\n\"If no other provisions have been inserted in the document--or if, being\ninserted, those other provisions should be discovered to have failed\nalso--I believe it to be impossible (especially if evidence can be found\nthat the admiral himself considered the Trust binding on him) for the\nexecutors to deal with your husband's fortune as legally forming part of\nAdmiral Bartram's estate. The legacy is expressly declared to have been\nleft to him, on the understanding that he applies it to certain stated\nobjects--and those objects have failed. What is to be done with the\nmoney? It was not left to the admiral himself, on the testator's own\nshowing; and the purposes for which it _was_ left have not been, and\ncannot be, carried out. I believe (if the case here supposed really\nhappens) that the money must revert to the testator's estate. In that\nevent the Law, dealing with it as a matter of necessity, divides it\ninto two equal portions. One half goes to Mr. Noel Vans tone's childless\nwidow, and the other half is divided among Mr. Noel Vanstone's next of\nkin.\n\n\"You will no doubt discover the obvious objection to the case in our\nfavor, as I have here put it. You will see that it depends for its\npractical realization not on one contingency, but on a series of\ncontingencies, which must all happen exactly as we wish them to happen.\nI admit the force of the objection; but I can tell you, at the same\ntime, that these said contingencies are by no means so improbable as\nthey may look on the face of them.\n\n\"We have every reason to believe that the Trust, like the Will, was\n_not_ drawn by a lawyer. That is one circumstance in our favor that is\nenough of itself to cast a doubt on the soundness of all, or any, of the\nremaining provisions which we may not be acquainted with. Another\nchance which we may count on is to be found, as I think, in that strange\nhandwriting, placed under the signature on the third page of the Letter,\nwhich you saw, but which you, unhappily, omitted to read. All the\nprobabilities point to those lines as written by Admiral Bartram: and\nthe position which they occupy is certainly consistent with the theory\nthat they touch the important subject of his own sense of obligation\nunder the Trust.\n\n\"I wish to raise no false hopes in your mind. I only desire to satisfy\nyou that we have a case worth trying.\n\n\"As for the dark side of the prospect, I need not enlarge on it. After\nwhat I have already written, you will understand that the existence of\na sound provision, unknown to us, in the Trust, which has been properly\ncarried out by the admiral--or which can be properly carried out by his\nrepresentatives--would be necessarily fatal to our hopes. The legacy\nwould be, in this case, devoted to the purpose or purposes contemplated\nby your husband--and, from that moment, you would have no claim.\n\n\"I have only to add, that as soon as I hear from the late admiral's man\nof business, you shall know the result.\n\n\"Believe me, dear madam, faithfully yours,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\"\n\n\nVII.\n\n_From George Bartram to Miss Garth._\n\n\"St. Crux, May 15th.\n\n\"DEAR MISS GARTH--I trouble you with another letter: partly to thank you\nfor your kind expression of sympathy with me, under the loss that I have\nsustained; and partly to tell you of an extraordinary application made\nto my uncle's executors, in which you and Miss Vanstone may both feel\ninterested, as Mrs. Noel Vanstone is directly concerned in it.\n\n\"Knowing my own ignorance of legal technicalities, I inclose a copy of\nthe application, instead of trying to describe it. You will notice as\nsuspicious, that no explanation is given of the manner in which the\nalleged discovery of one of my uncle's secrets was made, by persons who\nare total strangers to him.\n\n\"On being made acquainted with the circumstances, the executors at once\napplied to me. I could give them no positive information--for my uncle\nnever consulted me on matters of business. But I felt in honor bound to\ntell them, that during the last six months of his life, the admiral had\noccasionally let fall expressions of impatience in my hearing, which\nled to the conclusion that he was annoyed by a private responsibility of\nsome kind. I also mentioned that he had imposed a very strange condition\non me--a condition which, in spite of his own assurances to the\ncontrary, I was persuaded could not have emanated from himself--of\nmarrying within a given time (which time has now expired), or of not\nreceiving from him a certain sum of money, which I believed to be the\nsame in amount as the sum bequeathed to him in my cousin's will. The\nexecutors agreed with me that these circumstances gave a color of\nprobability to an otherwise incredible story; and they decided that\na search should be instituted for the Secret Trust, nothing in the\nslightest degree resembling this same Trust having been discovered, up\nto that time, among the admiral's papers.\n\n\"The search (no trifle in such a house as this) has now been in full\nprogress for a week. It is superintended by both the executors, and by\nmy uncle's lawyer, who is personally, as well as professionally, known\nto Mr. Loscombe (Mrs. Noel Vanstone's solicitor), and who has been\nincluded in the proceedings at the express request of Mr. Loscombe\nhimself. Up to this time, nothing whatever has been found. Thousands and\nthousands of letters have been examined, and not one of them bears the\nremotest resemblance to the letter we are looking for.\n\n\"Another week will bring the search to an end. It is only at my express\nrequest that it will be persevered with so long. But as the admiral's\ngenerosity has made me sole heir to everything he possessed, I feel\nbound to do the fullest justice to the interests of others, however\nhostile to myself those interests may be.\n\n\"With this view, I have not hesitated to reveal to the lawyer a\nconstitutional peculiarity of my poor uncle's, which was always kept a\nsecret among us at his own request--I mean his tendency to somnambulism.\nI mentioned that he had been discovered (by the housekeeper and his old\nservant) walking in his sleep, about three weeks before his death, and\nthat the part of the house in which he had been seen, and the basket of\nkeys which he was carrying in his hand, suggested the inference that he\nhad come from one of the rooms in the east wing, and that he might have\nopened some of the pieces of furniture in one of them. I surprised the\nlawyer (who seemed to be quite ignorant of the extraordinary actions\nconstantly performed by somnambulists), by informing him that my uncle\ncould find his way about the house, lock and unlock doors, and remove\nobjects of all kinds from one place to another, as easily in his sleep\nas in his waking hours. And I declared that, while I felt the faintest\ndoubt in my own mind whether he might not have been dreaming of the\nTrust on the night in question, and putting the dream in action in his\nsleep, I should not feel satisfied unless the rooms in the east wing\nwere searched again.\n\n\"It is only right to add that there is not the least foundation in fact\nfor this idea of mine. During the latter part of his fatal illness, my\npoor uncle was quite incapable of speaking on any subject whatever. From\nthe time of my arrival at St. Crux, in the middle of last month, to the\ntime of his death, not a word dropped from him which referred in the\nremotest way to the Secret Trust.\n\n\"Here then, for the present, the matter rests. If you think it right to\ncommunicate the contents of this letter to Miss Vanstone, pray tell\nher that it will not be my fault if her sister's assertion (however\npreposterous it may seem to my uncle's executors) is not fairly put to\nthe proof.\n\n\"Believe me, dear Miss Garth, always truly yours,\n\n\"GEORGE BARTRAM.\n\n\"P. S.--As soon as all business matters are settled, I am going abroad\nfor some months, to try the relief of change of scene. The house will be\nshut up, and left under the charge of Mrs. Drake. I have not forgotten\nyour once telling me that you should like to see St. Crux, if you ever\nfound yourself in this neighborhood. If you are at all likely to be\nin Essex during the time when I am abroad, I have provided against the\nchance of your being disappointed, by leaving instructions with Mrs.\nDrake to give you, and any friends of yours, the freest admission to the\nhouse and grounds.\"\n\n\nVIII.\n\n_From Mr. Loscombe to Mrs. Noel Vanstone._\n\n\"Lincoln's Inn Fields, May 24th.\n\n\"DEAR MADAM--After a whole fortnight's search--conducted, I am bound to\nadmit, with the most conscientious and unrelaxing care--no such document\nas the Secret Trust has been found among the papers left at St. Crux by\nthe late Admiral Bartram.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, the executors have decided on acting under\nthe only recognizable authority which they have to guide them--the\nadmiral's own will. This document (executed some years since) bequeaths\nthe whole of his estate, both real and personal (that is to say, all the\nlands he possesses, and all the money he possesses, at the time of his\ndeath), to his nephew. The will is plain, and the result is inevitable.\nYour husband's fortune is lost to you from this moment. Mr. Georg e\nBartram legally inherits it, as he legally inherits the house and estate\nof St. Crux.\n\n\"I make no comment upon this extraordinary close to the proceedings.\nThe Trust may have been destroyed, or the Trust may be hidden in some\nplace of concealment inaccessible to discovery. Either way, it is, in my\nopinion, impossible to found any valid legal declaration on a knowledge\nof the document so fragmentary and so incomplete as the knowledge which\nyou possess. If other lawyers differ from me on this point, by all\nmeans consult them. I have devoted money enough and time enough to the\nunfortunate attempt to assert your interests; and my connection with the\nmatter must, from this moment, be considered at an end.\n\n\"Your obedient servant,\n\n\"JOHN LOSCOMBE.\"\n\n\nIX.\n\n_From Mrs. Ruddock (Lodging-house Keeper) to Mr. Loscombe._\n\n\"Park Terrace, St. John's Wood, June 2d.\n\n\"SIR--Having, by Mrs. Noel Vanstone's directions, taken letters for her\nto the post, addressed to you--and knowing no one else to apply to--I\nbeg to inquire whether you are acquainted with any of her friends; for\nI think it right that they should be stirred up to take some steps about\nher.\n\n\"Mrs. Vanstone first came to me in November last, when she and her maid\noccupied my apartments. On that occasion, and again on this, she has\ngiven me no cause to complain of her. She has behaved like a lady, and\npaid me my due. I am writing, as a mother of a family, under a sense of\nresponsibility--I am not writing with an interested motive.\n\n\"After proper warning given, Mrs. Vanstone (who is now quite\nalone) leaves me to-morrow. She has not concealed from me that her\ncircumstances are fallen very low, and that she cannot afford to remain\nin my house. This is all she has told me--I know nothing of where she is\ngoing, or what she means to do next. But I have every reason to believe\nshe desires to destroy all traces by which she might be found, after\nleaving this place--for I discovered her in tears yesterday, burning\nletters which were doubtless letters from her friends. In looks and\nconduct she has altered most shockingly in the last week. I believe\nthere is some dreadful trouble on her mind; and I am afraid, from what I\nsee of her, that she is on the eve of a serious illness.

Five\ndays later, the vessel was in the river, and was towed into the East\nIndia Docks.\n\nHaving transacted the business on shore for which he was personally\nresponsible, Captain Kirke made the necessary arrangements, by\nletter, for visiting his brother-in-law's parsonage in Suffolk, on the\nseventeenth of the month. As usual in such cases, he received a list of\ncommissions to execute for his sister on the day before he left London.\nOne of these commissions took him into the neighborhood of Camden Town.\nHe drove to his destination from the Docks; and then, dismissing the\nvehicle, set forth to walk back southward, toward the New Road.\n\nHe was not well acquainted with the district; and his attention wandered\nfurther and further away from the scene around him as he went on. His\nthoughts, roused by the prospect of seeing his sister again, had led his\nmemory back to the night when he had parted from her, leaving the house\non foot. The spell so strangely laid on him, in that past time, had kept\nits hold through all after-events. The face that had haunted him on the\nlonely road had haunted him again on the lonely sea. The woman who\nhad followed him, as in a dream, to his sister's door, had followed\nhim--thought of his thought, and spirit of his spirit--to the deck of\nhis ship. Through storm and calm on the voyage out, through storm and\ncalm on the voyage home, she had been with him. In the ceaseless turmoil\nof the London streets, she was with him now. He knew what the first\nquestion on his lips would be, when he had seen his sister and her boys.\n\"I shall try to talk of something else,\" he thought; \"but when Lizzie\nand I am alone, it will come out in spite of me.\"\n\nThe necessity of waiting to let a string of carts pass at a turning\nbefore he crossed awakened him to present things. He looked about in a\nmomentary confusion. The street was strange to him; he had lost his way.\n\nThe first foot passenger of whom he inquired appeared to have no time\nto waste in giving information. Hurriedly directing him to cross to the\nother side of the road, to turn down the first street he came to on his\nright hand, and then to ask again, the stranger unceremoniously hastened\non without waiting to be thanked.\n\nKirke followed his directions and took the turning on his right. The\nstreet was short and narrow, and the houses on either side were of the\npoorer order. He looked up as he passed the corner to see what the name\nof the place might be. It was called \"Aaron's Buildings.\"\n\nLow down on the side of the \"Buildings\" along which he was walking,\na little crowd of idlers was assembled round two cabs, both drawn up\nbefore the door of the same house. Kirke advanced to the crowd, to ask\nhis way of any civil stranger among them who might _not_ be in a hurry\nthis time. On approaching the cabs, he found a woman disputing with the\ndrivers; and heard enough to inform him that two vehicles had been sent\nfor by mistake, where only one was wanted.\n\nThe house door was open; and when he turned that way next, he looked\neasily into the passage, over the heads of the people in front of him.\n\nThe sight that met his eyes should have been shielded in pity from the\nobservation of the street. He saw a slatternly girl, with a frightened\nface, standing by an old chair placed in the middle of the passage,\nand holding a woman on the chair, too weak and helpless to support\nherself--a woman apparently in the last stage of illness, who was about\nto be removed, when the dispute outside was ended, in one of the cabs.\nHer head was drooping when he first saw her, and an old shawl which\ncovered it had fallen forward so as to hide the upper part of her face.\n\nBefore he could look away again, the girl in charge of her raised her\nhead and restored the shawl to its place. The action disclosed her face\nto view, for an instant only, before her head drooped once more on her\nbosom. In that instant he saw the woman whose beauty was the haunting\nremembrance of his life--whose image had been vivid in his mind not five\nminutes since.\n\nThe shock of the double recognition--the recognition, at the same\nmoment, of the face, and of the dreadful change in it--struck him\nspeechless and helpless. The steady presence of mind in all emergencies\nwhich had become a habit of his life, failed him for the first time. The\npoverty-stricken street, the squalid mob round the door, swam before\nhis eyes. He staggered back and caught at the iron railings of the house\nbehind him.\n\n\"Where are they taking her to?\" he heard a woman ask, close at his side.\n\n\"To the hospital, if they will have her,\" was the reply. \"And to the\nwork-house, if they won't.\"\n\nThat horrible answer roused him. He pushed his way through the crowd and\nentered the house.\n\nThe misunderstanding on the pavement had been set right, and one of the\ncabs had driven off.\n\nAs he crossed the threshold of the door he confronted the people of\nthe house at the moment when they were moving her. The cabman who had\nremained was on one side of the chair, and the woman who had been\ndisputing with the two drivers was on the other. They were just lifting\nher, when Kirke's tall figure darkened the door.\n\n\"What are you doing with that lady?\" he asked.\n\nThe cabman looked up with the insolence of his reply visible in his\neyes, before his lips could utter it. But the woman, quicker than he,\nsaw the suppressed agitation in Kirke's face, and dropped her hold of\nthe chair in an instant.\n\n\"Do you know her, sir?\" asked the woman, eagerly. \"Are you one of her\nfriends?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kirke, without hesitation.\n\n\"It's not my fault, sir,\" pleaded the woman, shirking under the look\nhe fixed on her. \"I would have waited patiently till her friends found\nher--I would, indeed!\"\n\nKirke made no reply. He turned, and spoke to the cabman.\n\n\"Go out,\" he said, \"and close the door after you. I'll send you down\nyour money directly. What room in the house did you take her from,\nwhen you brought her here?\" he resumed, addressing himself to the woman\nagain.\n\n\"The first floor back, sir.\"\n\n\"Show me the way to it.\"\n\nHe stooped, and lifted Magdalen in his arms. Her head rested gently on\nthe sailor's breast; her eyes looked up wonderingly into the sailor's\nface. She smiled, and whispered to him vacantly. Her mind had wandered\nback to old days at home; and her few broken words showed that she\nfancied herself a child again in her father's arms. \"Poor papa!\" she\nsaid, softly. \"Why do you look so sorry? Poor papa!\"\n\nThe woman led the way into the back room on the first floor. It was very\nsmall; it was miserably furnished. But the little bed was clean, and the\nfew things in the room were neatly kept. Kirke laid her tenderly on the\nbed. She caught one of his hands in her burning fingers. \"Don't distress\nmamma about me,\" she said. \"Send for Norah.\" Kirke tried gently to\nrelease his hand; but she only clasped it the more eagerly. He sat down\nby the bedside to wait until it pleased her to release him. The woman\nstood looking at them and crying, in a corner of the room. Kirke\nobserved her attentively. \"Speak,\" he said, after an interval, in low,\nquiet tones. \"Speak in _her_ presence; and tell me the truth.\"\n\nWith many words, with many tears, the woman spoke.\n\nShe had let her first floor to the lady a fortnight since. The lady had\npaid a week's rent, and had given the name of Gray. She had been out\nfrom morning till night, for the first three days, and had come home\nagain, on every occasion, with a wretchedly weary, disappointed look.\nThe woman of the house had suspected that she was in hiding from her\nfriends, under a false name; and that she had been vainly trying to\nraise money, or to get some employment, on the three days when she was\nout for so long, and when she looked so disappointed on coming home.\nHowever that might be, on the fourth day she had fallen ill, with\nshivering fits and hot fits, turn and turn about. On the fifth day she\nwas worse; and on the sixth, she was too sleepy at one time, and too\nlight-headed at another, to be spoken to. The chemist (who did the\ndoctoring in those parts) had come and looked at her, and had said he\nthought it was a bad fever. He had left a \"saline draught,\" which\nthe woman of the house had paid for out of her own pocket, and had\nadministered without effect. She had ventured on searching the only box\nwhich the lady had brought with her; and had found nothing in it but a\nfew necessary articles of linen--no dresses, no ornaments, not so much\nas the fragment of a letter which might help in discovering her friends.\nBetween the risk of keeping her under these circumstances, and the\nbarbarity of turning a sick woman into the street, the landlady herself\nhad not hesitated. She would willingly have kept her tenant, on the\nchance of the lady's recovery, and on the chance of her friends turning\nup. But not half an hour since, her husband--who never came near the\nhouse, except to take her money--had come to rob her of her little\nearnings, as usual. She had been obliged to tell him that no rent was in\nhand for the first floor, and that none was likely to be in hand until\nthe lady recovered, or her friends found her. On hearing this, he had\nmercilessly insisted--well or ill--that the lady should go. There was\nthe hospital to take her to; and if the hospital shut its doors, there\nwas the workhouse to try next. If she was not out of the place in an\nhour's time, he threatened to come back and take her out himself. His\nwife knew but too well that he was brute enough to be as good as his\nword; and no other choice had been left her but to do as she had done,\nfor the sake of the lady herself.\n\nThe woman told her shocking story, with every appearance of being\nhonestly ashamed of it. Toward the end, Kirke felt the clasp of the\nburning fingers slackening round his hand. He looked back at the bed\nagain. Her weary eyes were closing; and, with her face still turned\ntoward the sailor, she was sinking into sleep.\n\n\"Is there any one in the front room?\" said Kirke, in a whisper. \"Come in\nthere; I have something to say to you.\"\n\nThe woman followed him through the door of communication between the\nrooms.\n\n\"How much does she owe you?\" he asked.\n\nThe landlady mentioned the sum. Kirke put it down before her on the\ntable.\n\n\"Where is your husband?\" was his next question.\n\n\"Waiting at the public-house, sir, till the hour is up.\"\n\n\"You can take him the money or not, as you think right,\" said Kirke,\nquietly. \"I have only one thing to tell you, as far as your husband is\nconcerned. If you want to see every bone in his skin broken, let him\ncome to the house while I am in it. Stop! I have something more to say.\nDo you know of any doctor in the neighborhood who can be depended on?\"\n\n\"Not in our neighborhood, sir. But I know of one within half an hour's\nwalk of us.\"\n\n\"Take the cab at the door; and, if you find him at home, bring him back\nin it. Say I am waiting here for his opinion on a very serious case. He\nshall be well paid, and you shall be well paid. Make haste!\"\n\nThe woman left the room.\n\nKirke sat down alone, to wait for her return. He hid his face in his\nhands, and tried to realize the strange and touching situation in which\nthe accident of a moment had placed him.\n\nHidden in the squalid by-ways of London under a false name; cast,\nfriendless and helpless, on the mercy of strangers, by illness which\nhad struck her prostrate, mind and body alike--so he met her again, the\nwoman who had opened a new world of beauty to his mind; the woman who\nhad called Love to life in him by a look! What horrible misfortune had\nstruck her so cruelly, and struck her so low? What mysterious destiny\nhad guided him to the last refuge of her poverty and despair, in the\nhour of her sorest need? \"If it is ordered that I am to see her again, I\n_shall_ see her.\" Those words came back to him now--the memorable words\nthat he had spoken to his sister at parting. With that thought in his\nheart, he had gone where his duty called him. Months and months had\npassed; thousands and thousands of miles, protracting their desolate\nlength on the unresting waters had rolled between them. And through the\nlapse of time, and over the waste of oceans--day after day, and night\nafter night, as the winds of heaven blew, and the good ship toiled\non before them--he had advanced nearer and nearer to the end that\nwas waiting for him; he had journeyed blindfold to the meeting on the\nthreshold of that miserable door. \"What has brought me here?\" he said to\nhimself in a whisper. \"The mercy of chance? No. The mercy of God.\"\n\nHe waited, unregardful of the place, unconscious of the time, until\nthe sound of footsteps on the stairs came suddenly between him and his\nthoughts. The door opened, and the doctor was shown into the room.\n\n\"Dr. Merrick,\" said the landlady, placing a chair for him.\n\n\"_Mr._ Merrick,\" said the visitor, smiling quietly as he took the chair.\n\"I am not a physician--I am a surgeon in general practice.\"\n\nPhysician or surgeon, there was something in his face and manner which\ntold Kirke at a glance that he was a man to be relied on.\n\nAfter a few preliminary words on either side, Mr. Merrick sent the\nlandlady into the bedroom to see if his patient was awake or asleep.\nThe woman returned, and said she was \"betwixt the two, light in the\nhead again, and burning hot.\" The doctor went at once into the bedroom,\ntelling the landlady to follow him, and to close the door behind her.\n\nA weary time passed before he came back into the front room. When he\nre-appeared, his face spoke for him, before any question could be asked.\n\n\"Is it a serious illness?\" said Kirke his voice sinking low, his eyes\nanxiously fixed on the doctor's face.\n\n\"It is a _dangerous_ illness,\" said Mr. Merrick, with an emphasis on the\nword.\n\nHe drew his chair nearer to Kirke and looked at him attentively.\n\n\"May I ask you some questions which are not strictly medical?\" he\ninquired.\n\nKirke bowed.\n\n\"Can you tell me what her life has been before she came into this house,\nand before she fell ill?\"\n\n\"I have no means of knowing. I have just returned to England after a\nlong absence.\"\n\n\"Did you know of her coming here?\"\n\n\"I only discovered it by accident.\"\n\n\"Has she no female relations? No mother? no sister? no one to take care\nof her but yourself?\"\n\n\"No one--unless I can succeed in tracing her relations. No one but\nmyself.\"\n\nMr. Merrick was silent. He looked at Kirke more attentively than ever.\n\"Strange!\" thought the doctor. \"He is here, in sole charge of her--and\nis this all he knows?\"\n\nKirke saw the doubt in his face; and addressed himself straight to that\ndoubt, before another word passed between them,\n\n\"I see my position here surprises you,\" he said, simply. \"Will you\nconsider it the position of a relation--the position of her brother or\nher father--until her friends can be found?\" His voice faltered, and he\nlaid his hand earnestly on the doctor's arm. \"I have taken this trust on\nmyself,\" he said; \"and as God shall judge me, I will not be unworthy of\nit!\"\n\nThe poor weary head lay on his breast again, the poor fevered fingers\nclasped his hand once more, as he spoke those words.\n\n\"I believe you,\" said the doctor, warmly. \"I believe you are an honest\nman.--Pardon me if I have seemed to intrude myself on your confidence. I\nrespect your reserve--from this moment it is sacred to me. In justice to\nboth of us, let me say that the questions I have asked were not prompted\nby mere curiosity. No common cause will account for the illness which\nhas laid my patient on that bed. She has suffered some long-continued\nmental trial, some wearing and terrible suspense--and she has broken\ndown under it. It might have helped me if I could have known what the\nnature of the trial was, and how long or how short a time elapsed before\nshe sank under it. In that hope I spoke.\"\n\n\"When you told me she was dangerously ill,\" said Kirke, \"did you mean\ndanger to her reason or to her life?\"\n\n\"To both,\" replied Mr. Merrick. \"Her whole nervous system has given way;\nall the ordinary functions of her brain are in a state of collapse.\nI can give you no plainer explanation than that of the nature of the\nmalady. The fever which frightens the people of the house is merely the\neffect. The cause is what I have told you. She may lie on that bed for\nweeks to come; passing alternately, without a gleam of consciousness,\nfrom a state of delirium to a state of repose. You must not be alarmed\nif you find her sleep lasting far beyond the natural time. That sleep\nis a better remedy than any I can give, and nothing must disturb it. All\nour art can accomplish is to watch her, to help her with stimulants from\ntime to time, and to wait for what Nature will do.\"\n\n\"Must she remain here? Is there no hope of our being able to remove her\nto a better place?\"\n\n\"No hope whatever, for the present. She has already been disturbed, as\nI understand, and she is seriously the worse for it. Even if she\ngets better, even if she comes to herself again, it would still be a\ndangerous experiment to move her too soon--the least excitement or alarm\nwould be fatal to her. You must make the best of this place as it is.\nThe landlady has my directions; and I will send a good nurse to help\nher. There is nothing more to be done. So far as her life can be said\nto be in any human hands, it is as much in your hands now as in\nmine. Everything depends on the care that is taken of her, under your\ndirection, in this house.\" With those farewell words he rose and quitted\nthe room.\n\nLeft by himself, Kirke walked to the door of communication, and,\nknocking at it softly, told the landlady he wished to speak with her.\n\nHe was far more composed, far more like his own resolute self, after his\ninterview with the doctor, than he had been before it. A man living in\nthe artificial social atmosphere which _this_ man had never breathed\nwould have felt painfully the worldly side of the situation--its novelty\nand strangeness; the serious present difficulty in which it placed him;\nthe numberless misinterpretations in the future to which it might lead.\nKirke never gave the situation a thought. He saw nothing but the duty\nit claimed from him--a duty which the doctor's farewell words had put\nplainly before his mind. Everything depended on the care taken of her,\nunder his direction, in that house. There was his responsibility, and he\nunconsciously acted under it, exactly as he would have acted in a\ncase of emergency with women and children on board his own ship. He\nquestioned the landlady in short, sharp sentences; the only change in\nhim was in the lowered tone of his voice, and in the anxious looks which\nhe cast, from time to time, at the room where she lay.\n\n\"Do you understand what the doctor has told you?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"The house must be kept quiet. Who lives in the house?\"\n\n\"Only me and my daughter, sir; we live in the parlors. Times have gone\nbadly with us since Lady Day. Both the rooms above this are to let.\"\n\n\"I will take them both, and the two rooms down here as well. Do you know\nof any active trustworthy man who can run on errands for me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. Shall I go--?\"\n\n\"No; let your daughter go. You must not leave the house until the nurse\ncomes. Don't send the messenger up here. Men of that sort tread heavily.\nI'll go down, and speak to him at the door.\"\n\nHe went down when the messenger came, and sent him first to purchase\npen, ink, and paper. The man's next errand dispatched him to make\ninquiries for a person who could provide for deadening the sound of\npassing wheels in the street by laying down tan before the house in the\nusual way. This object accomplished, the messenger received two letters\nto post. The first was addressed to Kirke's brother-in-law. It told him,\nin few and plain words, what had happened; and left him to break the\nnews to his wife as he thought best. The second letter was directed to\nthe landlord of the Aldborough Hotel. Magdalen's assumed name at North\nShingles was the only name by which Kirke knew her; and the one chance\nof tracing her relatives that he could discern was the chance of\ndiscovering her reputed uncle and aunt by means of inquiries starting\nfrom Aldborough.\n\nToward the close of the afternoon a decent middle-aged woman came to the\nhouse, with a letter from Mr. Merrick. She was well known to the doctor\nas a trustworthy and careful person, who had nursed his own wife; and\nshe would be assisted, from time to time, by a lady who was a member of\na religious Sisterhood in the district, and whose compassionate interest\nhad been warmly aroused in the case. Toward eight o'clock that evening\nthe doctor himself would call and see that his patient wanted for\nnothing.\n\nThe arrival of the nurse, and the relief of knowing that she was to\nbe trusted, left Kirke free to think of himself. His luggage was ready\npacked for his contemplated journey to Suffolk the next day. It was\nmerely necessary to transport it from the hotel to the house in Aaron's\nBuildings.\n\nHe stopped once only on his way to the hotel to look at a toyshop in one\nof the great thoroughfares. The miniature ships in the window reminded\nhim of his nephew. \"My little name-sake will be sadly disappointed at\nnot seeing me to-morrow,\" he thought. \"I must make it up to the boy by\nsending him something from his uncle.\" He went into the shop and bought\none of the ships. It was secured in a box, and packed and directed in\nhis presence. He put a ca rd on the deck of the miniature vessel before\nthe cover of the box was nailed on, bearing this inscription: \"A ship\nfor the little sailor, with the big sailor's love.\"--\"Children like to\nbe written to, ma'am,\" he said, apologetically, to the woman behind the\ncounter. \"Send the box as soon as you can--I am anxious the boy should\nget it to-morrow.\"\n\nToward the dusk of the evening he returned with his luggage to Aaron's\nBuildings. He took off his boots in the passage and carried his trunk\nupstairs himself; stopping, as he passed the first floor, to make his\ninquiries. Mr. Merrick was present to answer them.\n\n\"She was awake and wandering,\" said the doctor, \"a few minutes since.\nBut we have succeeded in composing her, and she is sleeping now.\"\n\n\"Have no words escaped her, sir, which might help us to find her\nfriends?\"\n\nMr. Merrick shook his head.\n\n\"Weeks and weeks may pass yet,\" he said, \"and that poor girl's story may\nstill be a sealed secret to all of us. We can only wait.\"\n\nSo the day ended--the first of many days that were to come.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE warm sunlight of July shining softly through a green blind; an open\nwindow with fresh flowers set on the sill; a strange bed, in a strange\nroom; a giant figure of the female sex (like a dream of Mrs. Wragge)\ntowering aloft on one side of the bed, and trying to clap its hands;\nanother woman (quickly) stopping the hands before they could make any\nnoise; a mild expostulating voice (like a dream of Mrs. Wragge again)\nbreaking the silence in these words, \"She knows me, ma'am, she knows me;\nif I mustn't be happy, it will be the death of me!\"--such were the\nfirst sights, such were the first sounds, to which, after six weeks of\noblivion, Magdalen suddenly and strangely awoke.\n\nAfter a little, the sights grew dim again, and the sounds sank into\nsilence. Sleep, the merciful, took her once more, and hushed her back to\nrepose.\n\nAnother day--and the sights were clearer, the sounds were louder.\nAnother--and she heard a man's voice, through the door, asking for\nnews from the sick-room. The voice was strange to her; it was always\ncautiously lowered to the same quiet tone. It inquired after her, in the\nmorning, when she woke--at noon, when she took her refreshment--in the\nevening, before she dropped asleep again. \"Who is so anxious about me?\"\nThat was the first thought her mind was strong enough to form--\"Who is\nso anxious about me?\"\n\nMore days--and she could speak to the nurse at her bedside; she could\nanswer the questions of an elderly man, who knew far more about her than\nshe knew about herself, and who told her he was Mr. Merrick, the doctor;\nshe could sit up in bed, supported by pillows, wondering what had\nhappened to her, and where she was; she could feel a growing curiosity\nabout that quiet voice, which still asked after her, morning, noon, and\nnight, on the other side of the door.\n\nAnother day's delay--and Mr. Merrick asked her if she was strong enough\nto see an old friend. A meek voice, behind him, articulating high in\nthe air, said, \"It's only me.\" The voice was followed by the prodigious\nbodily apparition of Mrs. Wragge, with her cap all awry, and one of\nher shoes in the next room. \"Oh, look at her! look at her!\" cried Mrs.\nWragge, in an ecstasy, dropping on her knees at Magdalen's bedside, with\na thump that shook the house. \"Bless her heart, she's well enough to\nlaugh at me already. 'Cheer, boys, cheer--!' I beg your pardon, doctor,\nmy conduct isn't ladylike, I know. It's my head, sir; it isn't _me._ I\nmust give vent somehow, or my head will burst!\" No coherent sentence,\nin answer to any sort of question put to her, could be extracted that\nmorning from Mrs. Wragge. She rose from one climax of verbal confusion\nto another--and finished her visit under the bed, groping inscrutably\nfor the second shoe.\n\nThe morrow came--and Mr. Merrick promised that she should see another\nold friend on the next day. In the evening, when the inquiring voice\nasked after her, as usual, and when the door was opened a few inches to\ngive the reply, she answered faintly for herself: \"I am better, thank\nyou.\" There was a moment of silence--and then, just as the door was\nshut again, the voice sank to a whisper, and said, fervently, \"Thank\nGod!\" Who was he? She had asked them all, and no one would tell her. Who\nwas he?\n\nThe next day came; and she heard her door opened softly. Brisk footsteps\ntripped into the room; a lithe little figure advanced to the bed-side.\nWas it a dream again? No! There he was in his own evergreen reality,\nwith the copious flow of language pouring smoothly from his lips; with\nthe lambent dash of humor twinkling in his party-colored eyes--there he\nwas, more audacious, more persuasive, more respectable than ever, in a\nsuit of glossy black, with a speckless white cravat, and a rampant shirt\nfrill--the unblushing, the invincible, unchangeable Wragge!\n\n\"Not a word, my dear girl!\" said the captain, seating himself\ncomfortably at the bedside, in his old confidential way. \"I am to do\nall the talking; and, I think you will own, a more competent man for\nthe purpose could not possibly have been found. I am really\ndelighted--honestly delighted, if I may use such an apparently\ninappropriate word--to see you again, and to see you getting well. I\nhave often thought of you; I have often missed you; I have often said\nto myself--never mind what! Clear the stage, and drop the curtain on the\npast. _Dum vivimus, vivamus!_ Pardon the pedantry of a Latin quotation,\nmy dear, and tell me how I look. Am I, or am I not, the picture of a\nprosperous man?\"\n\nMagdalen attempted to answer him. The captain's deluge of words flowed\nover her again in a moment.\n\n\"Don't exert yourself,\" he said. \"I'll put all your questions for you.\nWhat have I been about? Why do I look so remarkably well off? And how\nin the world did I find my way to this house? My dear girl, I have been\noccupied, since we last saw each other, in slightly modifying my old\nprofessional habits. I have shifted from Moral Agriculture to Medical\nAgriculture. Formerly I preyed on the public sympathy, now I prey on the\npublic stomach. Stomach and sympathy, sympathy and stomach--look them\nboth fairly in the face when you reach the wrong side of fifty, and you\nwill agree with me that they come to much the same thing. However that\nmay be, here I am--incredible as it may appear--a man with an income,\nat last. The founders of my fortune are three in number. Their names are\nAloes, Scammony, and Gamboge. In plainer words, I am now living--on a\nPill. I made a little money (if you remember) by my friendly connection\nwith you. I made a little more by the happy decease (_Requiescat in\nPace!_) of that female relative of Mrs. Wragge's from whom, as I told\nyou, my wife had expectations. Very good. What do you think I did? I\ninvested the whole of my capital, at one fell swoop, in advertisements,\nand purchased my drugs and my pill-boxes on credit. The result is\nnow before you. Here I am, a Grand Financial Fact. Here I am, with my\nclothes positively paid for; with a balance at my banker's; with\nmy servant in livery, and my gig at the door; solvent, flourishing,\npopular--and all on a Pill.\"\n\nMagdalen smiled. The captain's face assumed an expression of mock\ngravity; he looked as if there was a serious side to the question, and\nas if he meant to put it next.\n\n\"It's no laughing matter to the public, my dear,\" he said. \"They can't\nget rid of me and my Pill; they must take us. There is not a single\nform of appeal in the whole range of human advertisement which I am\nnot making to the unfortunate public at this moment. Hire the last new\nnovel, there I am, inside the boards of the book. Send for the last new\nSong--the instant you open the leaves, I drop out of it. Take a\ncab--I fly in at the window in red. Buy a box of tooth-powder at the\nchemist's--I wrap it up for you in blue. Show yourself at the theater--I\nflutter down on you in yellow. The mere titles of my advertisements\nare quite irresistible. Let me quote a few from last week's issue.\nProverbial Title: 'A Pill in time saves Nine.' Familiar Title: 'Excuse\nme, how is your Stomach?' Patriotic Title: 'What are the three\ncharacteristics of a true-born Englishman? His Hearth, his Home, and his\nPill.' Title in the form of a nursery dialogue: 'Mamma, I am not well.'\n'What is the matter, my pet?' 'I want a little Pill.' Title in the form\nof a Historical Anecdote: 'New Discovery in the Mine of English History.\nWhen the Princes were smothered in the Tower, their faithful attendant\ncollected all their little possessions left behind them. Among the\ntouching trifles dear to the poor boys, he found a tiny Box. It\ncontained the Pill of the Period. Is it necessary to say how inferior\nthat Pill was to its Successor, which prince and peasant alike may now\nobtain?'--Et cetera, et cetera. The place in which my Pill is made is an\nadvertisement in itself. I have got one of the largest shops in London.\nBehind one counter (visible to the public through the lucid medium of\nplate-glass) are four-and-twenty young men, in white aprons, making the\nPill. Behind another counter are four-and-twenty young men, in white\ncravats, making the boxes. At the bottom of the shop are three elderly\naccountants, posting the vast financial transactions accruing from the\nPill in three enormous ledgers. Over the door are my name, portrait, and\nautograph, expanded to colossal proportions, and surrounded in flowing\nletters, by the motto of the establishment, 'Down with the Doctors!'\nEven Mrs. Wragge contributes her quota to this prodigious enterprise.\nShe is the celebrated woman whom I have cured of indescribable agonies\nfrom every complaint under the sun. Her portrait is engraved on all the\nwrappers, with the following inscription beneath it: 'Before she took\nthe Pill you might have blown this patient away with a feather. Look at\nher now!!!' Last, not least, my dear girl, the Pill is the cause of my\nfinding my way to this house. My department in the prodigious Enterprise\nalready mentioned is to scour the United Kingdom in a gig, establishing\nAgencies everywhere. While founding one of those Agencies, I heard of a\ncertain friend of mine, who had lately landed in England, after a long\nsea-voyage. I got his address in London--he was a lodger in this house.\nI called on him forthwith, and was stunned by the news of your illness.\nSuch, in brief, is the history of my existing connection with British\nMedicine; and so it happens that you see me at the present moment\nsitting in the present chair, now as ever, yours truly, Horatio Wragge.\"\nIn these terms the captain brought his personal statement to a close. He\nlooked more and more attentively at Magdalen, the nearer he got to the\nconclusion. Was there some latent importance attaching to his last words\nwhich did not appear on the face of them? There was. His visit to the\nsick-room had a serious object, and that object he had now approached.\n\n\nIn describing the circumstances under which he had become acquainted\nwith Magdalen's present position, Captain Wragge had skirted, with his\ncustomary dexterity, round the remote boundaries of truth. Emboldened\nby the absence of any public scandal in connection with Noel Vanstone's\nmarriage, or with the event of his death as announced in the newspaper\nobituary, the captain, roaming the eastern circuit, had ventured back to\nAldborough a fortnight since, to establish an agency there for the sale\nof his wonderful Pill. No one had recognized him but the landlady of\nthe hotel, who at once insisted on his entering the house and reading\nKirke's letter to her husband. The same night Captain Wragge was in\nLondon, and was closeted with the sailor in the second-floor room at\nAaron's Buildings.\n\nThe serious nature of the situation, the indisputable certainty that\nKirke must fail in tracing Magdalen's friends unless he first knew who\nshe really was, had decided the captain on disclosing part, at least, of\nthe truth. Declining to enter into any particulars--for family reasons,\nwhich Magdalen might explain on her recovery, if she pleased--he\nastounded Kirke by telling him that the friendless woman whom he\nhad rescued, and whom he had only known up to that moment as Miss\nBygrave--was no other than the youngest daughter of Andrew Vanstone. The\ndisclosure, on Kirke's side, of his father's connection with the\nyoung officer in Canada, had followed naturally on the revelation of\nMagdalen's real name. Captain Wragge had expressed his surprise, but had\nmade no further remark at the time. A fortnight later, however, when\nthe patient's recovery forced the serious difficulty on the doctor of\nmeeting the questions which Magdalen was sure to ask, the captain's\ningenuity had come, as usual, to the rescue.\n\n\"You can't tell her the truth,\" he said, \"without awakening painful\nrecollections of her stay at Aldborough, into which I am not at liberty\nto enter. Don't acknowledge just yet that Mr. Kirke only knew her as\nMiss Bygrave of North Shingles when he found her in this house. Tell her\nboldly that he knew who she was, and that he felt (what she must feel)\nthat he had a hereditary right to help and protect her as his father's\nson. I am, as I have already told you,\" continued the captain, sticking\nfast to his old assertion, \"a distant relative of the Combe-Raven\nfamily; and, if there is nobody else at hand to help you through this\ndifficulty, my services are freely at your disposal.\"\n\nNo one else was at hand, and the emergency was a serious one.\nStrangers undertaking the responsibility might ignorantly jar on past\nrecollections, which it would, perhaps, be the death of her to revive\ntoo soon. Near relatives might, by their premature appearance at the\nbedside, produce the same deplorable result. The alternative lay between\nirritating and alarming her by leaving her inquiries unanswered, or\ntrusting Captain Wragge. In the doctor's opinion, the second risk was\nthe least serious risk of the two--and the captain was now seated at\nMagdalen's bedside in discharge of the trust confided to him.\n\nWould she ask the question which it had been the private object of all\nCaptain Wragge's preliminary talk lightly and pleasantly to provoke?\nYes; as soon as his silence gave her the opportunity, she asked it: \"Who\nwas that friend of his living in the house?\"\n\n\"You ought by rights to know him as well as I do,\" said the captain.\n\"He is the son of one of your father's old military friends, when your\nfather was quartered with his regiment in Canada. Your cheeks mustn't\nflush up! If they do, I shall go away.\"\n\nShe was astonished, but not agitated. Captain Wragge had begun by\ninteresting her in the remote past, which she only knew by hearsay,\nbefore he ventured on the delicate ground of her own experience.\n\nIn a moment more she advanced to her next question: \"What was his name?\"\n\n\"Kirke,\" proceeded the captain. \"Did you never hear of his father, Major\nKirke, commanding officer of the regiment in Canada? Did you never hear\nthat the major helped your father through a great difficulty, like the\nbest of good fellows and good friends?\"\n\nYes; she faintly fancied she had heard something about her father and an\nofficer who had once been very good to him when he was a young man.\nBut she could not look back so long. \"Was Mr. Kirke poor?\" Even Captain\nWragge's penetration was puzzled by that question. He gave the true\nanswer at hazard. \"No,\" he said, \"not poor.\"\n\nHer next inquiry showed what she had been thinking of. \"If Mr. Kirke was\nnot poor, why did he come to live in that house?\"\n\n\"She has caught me!\" thought the captain. \"There is only one way out of\nit--I must administer another dose of truth. Mr. Kirke discovered you\nhere by chance,\" he proceeded, aloud, \"very ill, and not nicely attended\nto. Somebody was wanted to take care of you while you were not able\nto take care of yourself. Why not Mr. Kirke? He was the son of your\nfather's old friend--which is the next thing to being _your_ old friend.\nWho had a better claim to send for the right doctor, and get the right\nnurse, when I was not here to cure you with my wonderful Pill? Gently!\ngently! you mustn't take hold of my superfine black coat-sleeve in that\nunceremonious manner.\"\n\nHe put her hand back on the bed, but she was not to be checked in that\nway. She persisted in asking another question.--How came Mr. Kirke\nto know her? She had never seen him; she had never heard of him in her\nlife.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Captain Wragge. \"But your never having seen _him_ is\nno reason why he should not have seen _you_.\"\n\n\"When did he see me?\"\n\nThe captain corked up his doses of truth on the spot without a moment's\nhesitation. \"Some time ago, my dear. I can't exactly say when.\"\n\n\"Only once?\"\n\nCaptain Wragge suddenly saw his way to the administration of another\ndose. \"Yes,\" he said, \"only once.\"\n\nShe reflected a little. The next question involved the simultaneous\nexpression of two ideas, and the next question cost her an effort.\n\n\"He only saw me once,\" she said, \"and he only saw me some time ago. How\ncame he to remember me when he found me here?\"\n\n\"Aha!\" said the captain. \"Now you have hit the right nail on the head at\nlast. You can't possibly be more surprised at his remembering you than\nI am. A word of advice, my dear. When you are well enough to get up\nand see Mr. Kirke, try how that sharp question of yours sounds in _his_\nears, and insist on his answering it himself.\" Slipping out of the\ndilemma in that characteristically adroit manner, Captain Wragge got\nbriskly on his legs again and took up his hat.\n\n\"Wait!\" she pleaded. \"I want to ask you--\"\n\n\"Not another word,\" said the captain. \"I have given you quite enough to\nthink of for one day. My time is up, and my gig is waiting for me. I am\noff, to scour the country as usual. I am off, to cultivate the field\nof public indigestion with the triple plowshare of aloes, scammony and\ngamboge.\" He stopped and turned round at the door. \"By-the-by, a message\nfrom my unfortunate wife. If you will allow her to come and see you\nagain, Mrs. Wragge solemnly promises _not_ to lose her shoe next time.\n_I_ don't believe her. What do you say? May she come?\"\n\n\"Yes; whenever she likes,\" said Magdalen. \"If I ever get well again, may\npoor Mrs. Wragge come and stay with me?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear. If you have no objection, I will provide her\nbeforehand with a few thousand impressions in red, blue, and yellow of\nher own portrait ('You might have blown this patient away with a feather\nbefore she took the Pill. Look at her now!'). She is sure to drop\nherself about perpetually wherever she goes, and the most gratifying\nresults, in an advertising point of view, must inevitably follow. Don't\nthink me mercenary--I merely understand the age I live in.\" He stopped\non his way out, for the second time, and turned round once more at the\ndoor. \"You have been a remarkably good girl,\" he said, \"and you deserve\nto be rewarded for it. I'll give you a last piece of information before\nI go. Have you heard anybody inquiring after you, for the last day or\ntwo, outside your door? Ah! I see you have. A word in your ear, my dear.\nThat's Mr. Kirke.\" He tripped away from the bedside as briskly as ever.\nMagdalen heard him advertising himself to the nurse before he closed\nthe door. \"If you are ever asked about it,\" he said, in a confidential\nwhisper, \"the name is Wragge, and the Pill is to be had in neat boxes,\nprice thirteen pence half-penny, government stamp included. Take a few\ncopies of the portrait of a female patient, whom you might have blown\naway with a feather before she took the Pill, and whom you are simply\nrequested to contemplate now. Many thanks. _Good_-morning.\"\n\n\nThe door closed and Magdalen was alone again. She felt no sense of\nsolitude; Captain Wragge had left her with something new to think of.\nHour after hour her mind dwelt wonderingly on Mr. Kirke, until the\nevening came, and she heard his voice again through the half-opened\ndoor.\n\n\"I am very grateful,\" she said to him, before the nurse could answer his\ninquiries--\"very, very grateful for all your goodness to me.\"\n\n\"Try to get well,\" he replied, kindly. \"You will more than reward me, if\nyou try to get well.\"\n\nThe next morning Mr. Merrick found her impatient to leave her bed, and\nbe moved to the sofa in the front room. The doctor said he supposed\nshe wanted a change. \"Yes,\" she replied; \"I want to see Mr. Kirke.\" The\ndoctor consented to move her on the next day, but he positively forbade\nthe additional excitement of seeing anybody until the day after. She\nattempted a remonstrance--Mr. Merrick was impenetrable. She tried, when\nhe was gone, to win the nurse by persuasion--the nurse was impenetrable,\ntoo.\n\nOn the next day they wrapped her in shawls, and carried her in to the\nsofa, and made her a little bed on it. On the table near at hand were\nsome flowers and a number of an illustrated paper. She immediately asked\nwho had put them there. The nurse (failing to notice a warning look from\nthe doctor) said Mr. Kirke had thought that she might like the flowers,\nand that the pictures in the paper might amuse her. After that reply,\nher anxiety to see Mr. Kirke became too ungovernable to be trifled with.\nThe doctor left the room at once to fetch him.\n\nShe looked eagerly at the opening door. Her first glance at him as he\ncame in raised a doubt in her mind whether she now saw that tall figure\nand that open sun-burned face for the first time. But she was too weak\nand too agitated to follow her recollections as far back as Aldborough.\nShe resigned the attempt, and only looked at him. He stopped at the foot\nof the sofa and said a few cheering words. She beckoned to him to come\nnearer, and offered him her wasted hand. He tenderly took it in his, and\nsat down by her. They were both silent. His face told her of the sorrow\nand the sympathy which his silence would fain have concealed. She still\nheld his hand--consciously now--as persistently as she had held it on\nthe day when he found her. Her eyes closed, after a vain effort to speak\nto him, and the tears rolled slowly over her wan white cheeks.\n\nThe doctor signed to Kirke to wait and give her time. She recovered a\nlittle and looked at him. \"How kind you have been to me!\" she murmured.\n\"And how little I have deserved it!\"\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" he said. \"You don't know what a happiness it was to me to\nhelp you.\"\n\nThe sound of his voice seemed to strengthen her, and to give her\ncourage. She lay looking at him with an eager interest, with a gratitude\nwhich artlessly ignored all the conventional restraints that interpose\nbetween a woman and a man. \"Where did you see me,\" she said, suddenly,\n\"before you found me here?\"\n\nKirke hesitated. Mr. Merrick came to his assistance.\n\n\"I forbid you to say a word about the past to Mr. Kirke,\" interposed the\ndoctor; \"and I forbid Mr. Kirke to say a word about it to _you._ You are\nbeginning a new life to-day, and the only recollections I sanction are\nrecollections five minutes old.\"\n\nShe looked at the doctor and smiled. \"I must ask him one question,\" she\nsaid, and turned back again to Kirke. \"Is it true that you had only seen\nme once before you came to this house?\"\n\n\"Quite true!\" He made the reply with a sudden change of color which she\ninstantly detected. Her brightening eyes looked at him more earnestly\nthan ever, as she put her next question.\n\n\"How came you to remember me after only seeing me once?\"\n\nHis hand unconsciously closed on hers, and pressed it for the first\ntime. He attempted to answer, and hesitated at the first word. \"I have a\ngood memory,\" he said at last; and suddenly looked away from her with\na confusion so strangely unlike his customary self-possession of manner\nthat the doctor and the nurse both noticed it.\n\nEvery nerve in her body felt that momentary pressure of his hand, with\nthe exquisite susceptibility which accompanies the first faltering\nadvance on the way to health. She looked at his changing color, she\nlistened to his hesitating words, with every sensitive perception of her\nsex and age quickened to seize intuitively on the truth. In the moment\nwhen he looked away from her, she gently took her hand from him, and\nturned her head aside on the pillow. \"_Can_ it be?\" she thought, with\na flutter of delicious fear at her heart, with a glow of delicious\nconfusion burning on her cheeks. \"_Can_ it be?\"\n\nThe doctor made another sign to Kirke. He understood it, and rose\nimmediately. The momentary discomposure in his face and manner had both\ndisappeared. He was satisfied in his own mind that he had successfully\nkept his secret, and in the relief of feeling that conviction he had\nbecome himself again.\n\n\"Good-by till to-morrow,\" he said, as he left the room.\n\n\"Good-by,\" she answered, softly, without looking at him.\n\nMr. Merrick took the chair which Kirke had resigned, and laid his hand\non her pulse. \"Just what I feared,\" remarked the doctor; \"too quick by\nhalf.\"\n\nShe petulantly snatched away her wrist. \"Don't!\" she said, shrinking\nfrom him. \"Pray don't touch me!\"\n\nMr. Merrick good-humoredly gave up his place to the nurse. \"I'll return\nin half an hour,\" he whispered, \"and carry her back to bed. Don't let\nher talk. Show her the pictures in the newspaper, and keep her quiet in\nthat way.\"\n\nWhen the doctor returned, the nurse reported that the newspaper had not\nbeen wanted. The patient's conduct had been exemplary. She had not been\nat all restless, and she had never spoken a word.\n\n\nThe days passed, and the time grew longer and longer which the doctor\nallowed her to spend in the front room. She was soon able to dispense\nwith the bed on the sofa--she could be dressed, and could sit up,\nsupported by pillows, in an arm-chair. Her hours of emancipation from\nthe bedroom represented the great daily event of her life. They were the\nhours she passed in Kirke's society.\n\nShe had a double interest in him now--her interest in the man whose\nprotecting care had saved her reason and her life; her interest in the\nman whose heart's deepest secret she had surprised. Little by little\nthey grew as easy and familiar with each other as old friends; little by\nlittle she presumed on all her privileges, and wound her way unsuspected\ninto the most intimate knowledge of his nature.\n\nHer questions were endless. Everything that he could tell her of himself\nand his life she drew from him delicately and insensibly: he, the least\nself-conscious of mankind, became an egotist in her dexterous hands. She\nfound out his pride in his ship, and practiced on it without remorse.\nShe drew him into talking of the fine qualities of the vessel, of the\ngreat things the vessel had done in emergencies, as he had never in his\nlife talked yet to any living creature on shore. She found him out in\nprivate seafaring anxieties and unutterable seafaring exultations which\nhe had kept a secret from his own mate. She watched his kindling face\nwith a delicious sense of triumph in adding fuel to the fire; she\ntrapped him into forgetting all considerations of time and place, and\nstriking as hearty a stroke on the rickety little lodging-house table,\nin the fervor of his talk, as if his hand had descended on the\nsolid bulwark of his ship. His confusion at the discovery of his own\nforgetfulness secretly delighted her; she could have cried with pleasure\nwhen he penitently wondered what he could possibly have been thinking\nof.\n\nAt other times she drew him from dwelling on the pleasures of his life,\nand led him into talking of its perils--the perils of that jealous\nmistress the sea, which had absorbed so much of his existence, which had\nkept him so strangely innocent and ignorant of the world on shore. Twice\nhe had been shipwrecked. Times innumerable he and all with him had been\nthreatened with death, and had escaped their doom by the narrowness of\na hair-breadth. He was always unwilling at the outset to speak of this\ndark and dreadful side of his life: it was only by adroitly tempting\nhim, by laying little snares for him in his talk, that she lured him\ninto telling her of the terrors of the great deep. She sat listening to\nhim with a breathless interest, looking at him with a breathless wonder,\nas those fearful stories--made doubly vivid by the simple language\nin which he told them--fell, one by one, from his lips. His noble\nunconsciousness of his own heroism--the artless modesty with which\nhe described his own acts of dauntless endurance and devoted courage,\nwithout an idea that they were anything more than plain acts of duty\nto which he was bound by the vocation that he followed--raised him to\na place in her estimation so hopelessly high above her that she became\nuneasy and impatient until she had pulled down the idol again which\nshe herself had set up. It was on these occasions that she most rigidly\nexacted from him all those little familiar attentions so precious to\nwomen in their intercourse with men. \"This hand,\" she thought, with an\nexquisite delight in secretly following the idea while he was close to\nher--\"this hand that has rescued the drowning from death is shifting my\npillows so tenderly that I hardly know when they are moved. This hand\nthat has seized men mad with mutiny, and driven them back to their\nduty by main force, is mixing my lemonade and peeling my fruit more\ndelicately and more neatly than I could do it for myself. Oh, if I could\nbe a man, how I should like to be such a man as this!\"\n\nShe never allowed her thoughts, while she was in his presence, to lead\nher beyond that point. It was only when the night had separated them\nthat she ventured to let her mind dwell on the self-sacrificing devotion\nwhich had so mercifully rescued her. Kirke little knew how she thought\nof him, in the secrecy of her own chamber, during the quiet hours that\nelapsed before she sank to sleep. No suspicion crossed his mind of the\ninfluence which he was exerting over her--of the new spirit which he was\nbreathing into that new life, so sensitively open to impression in the\nfirst freshness of its recovered sense. \"She has nobody else to amuse\nher, poor thing,\" he used to think, sadly, sitting alone in his small\nsecond-floor room. \"If a rough fellow like me can beguile the weary\nhours till her friends come here, she is heartily welcome to all that I\ncan tell her.\"\n\nHe was out of spirits and restless now whenever he was by himself.\nLittle by little he fell into a habit of taking long, lonely walks at\nnight, when Magdalen thought he was sleeping upstairs. Once he went away\nabruptly in the day-time--on business, as he said. Something had passed\nbetween Magdalen and himself the evening before which had led her into\ntelling him her age. \"Twenty last birthday,\" he thought. \"Take twenty\nfrom forty-one. An easy sum in subtraction--as easy a sum as my little\nnephew could wish for.\" He walked to the Docks, and looked bitterly at\nthe shipping. \"I mustn't forget how a ship is made,\" he said. \"It won't\nbe long before I am back at the old work again.\" On leaving the Docks\nhe paid a visit to a brother sailor--a married man. In the course\nof conversation he asked how much older his friend might be than his\nfriend's wife. There was six years' difference between them. \"I suppose\nthat's difference enough?\" said Kirke. \"Yes,\" said his friend; \"quite\nenough. Are you looking out for a wife at last? Try a seasoned woman of\nthirty-five--that's your mark, Kirke, as near as I can calculate.\"\n\n\nThe time passed smoothly and quickly--the present time, in which _she_\nwas recovering so happily--the present time, which _he_ was beginning to\ndistrust already.\n\nEarly one morning Mr. Merrick surprised Kirke by a visit in his little\nroom on the second floor.\n\n\"I came to the conclusion yesterday,\" said the doctor, entering abruptly\non his business, \"that our patient was strong enough to justify us at\nlast in running all risks, and communicating with her friends; and I\nhave accordingly followed the clew which that queer fellow, Captain\nWragge, put into our hands. You remember he advised us to apply to Mr.\nPendril, the lawyer? I saw Mr. Pendril two days ago, and was referred\nby him--not overwillingly, as I thought--to a lady named Miss Garth.\nI heard enough from her to satisfy me that we have exercised a wise\ncaution in acting as we have done. It is a very, very sad story; and I\nam bound to say that I, for one, make great allowances for the poor girl\ndownstairs. Her only relation in the world is her elder sister. I have\nsuggested that the sister shall write to her in the first instance, and\nthen, if the letter does her no harm, follow it personally in a day or\ntwo. I have not given the address, by way of preventing any visits from\nbeing paid here without my permission. All I have done is to undertake\nto forward the letter, and I shall probably find it at my house when I\nget back. Can you stop at home until I send my man with it? There is not\nthe least hope of my being able to bring it myself. All you need do is\nto watch for an opportunity when she is not in the front room, and to\nput the letter where she can see it when she comes in. The handwriting\non the address will break the news before she opens the letter. Say\nnothing to her about it--take care that the landlady is within call--and\nleave her to herself. I know I can trust _you_ to follow my directions,\nand that is why I ask you to do us this service. You look out of spirits\nthis morning. Natural enough. You're used to plenty of fresh air,\ncaptain, and you're beginning to pine in this close place.\"\n\n\"May I ask a question, doctor? Is _she_ pining in this close place, too?\nWhen her sister comes, will her sister take her away?\"\n\n\"Decidedly, if my advice is followed. She will be well enough to be\nmoved in a week or less. Good-day. You are certainly out of spirits, and\nyour hand feels feverish. Pining for the blue water, captain--pining for\nthe blue water!\" With that expression of opinion, the doctor cheerfully\nwent out.\n\nIn an hour the letter arrived. Kirke took it from the landlady\nreluctantly, and almost roughly, without looking at it. Having\nascertained that Magdalen was still engaged at her toilet, and having\nexplained to the landlady the necessity of remaining within call, he\nwent downstairs immediately, and put the letter on the table in the\nfront room. Magdalen heard the sound of the familiar step on the floor.\n\"I shall soon be ready,\" she called to him, through the door.\n\nHe made no reply; he took his hat and went out. After a momentary\nhesitation, he turned his face eastward, and called on the ship-owners\nwho employed him, at their office in Cornhill.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nMAGDALEN'S first glance round the empty room showed her the letter on\nthe table. The address, as the doctor had predicted, broke the news the\nmoment she looked at it.\n\nNot a word escaped her. She sat down by the table, pale and silent, with\nthe letter in her lap. Twice she attempted to open it, and twice she put\nit back again. The bygone time was not alone in her mind as she looked\nat her sister's handwriting: the fear of Kirke was there with it. \"My\npast life!\" she thought. \"What will he think of me when he knows my past\nlife?\"\n\nShe made another effort, and broke the seal. A second letter dropped out\nof the inclosure, addressed to her in a handwriting with which she was\nnot familiar. She put the second letter aside and read the lines which\nNorah had written:\n\n\n\"Ventnor, Isle of Wight, August 24th.\n\n\"MY DEAREST MAGDALEN--When you read this letter, try to think we have\nonly been parted since yesterday; and dismiss from your mind (as I have\ndismissed from mine) the past and all that belongs to it.\n\n\"I am strictly forbidden to agitate you, or to weary you by writing\na long letter. Is it wrong to tell you that I am the happiest woman\nliving? I hope not, for I can't keep the secret to myself.\n\n\"My darling, prepare yourself for the greatest surprise I have ever\ncaused you. I am married. It is only a week to-day since I parted with\nmy old name--it is only a week since I have been the happy wife of\nGeorge Bartram, of St. Crux.\n\n\"There were difficulties at first in the way of our marriage, some of\nthem, I am afraid, of my making. Happily for me, my husband knew from\nthe beginning that I really loved him: he gave me a second chance of\ntelling him so, after I had lost the first, and, as you see, I was wise\nenough to take it. You ought to be especially interested, my love,\nin this marriage, for you are the cause of it. If I had not gone to\nAldborough to search for the lost trace of you--if George had not\nbeen brought there at the same time by circumstances in which you were\nconcerned, my husband and I might never have met. When we look back to\nour first impressions of each other, we look back to _you_.\n\n\"I must keep my promise not to weary you; I must bring this letter\n(sorely against my will) to an end. Patience! patience! I shall see you\nsoon. George and I are both coming to London to take you back with us to\nVentnor. This is my husband's invitation, mind, as well as mine. Don't\nsuppose I married him, Magdalen, until I had taught him to think of you\nas I think--to wish with my wishes, and to hope with my hopes. I could\nsay so much more about this, so much more about George, if I might only\ngive my thoughts and my pen their own way; but I must leave Miss Garth\n(at her own special request) a blank space to fill up on the last\npage of this letter; and I must only add one word more before I say\ngood-by--a word to warn you that I have another surprise in store, which\nI am keeping in reserve until we meet. Don't attempt to guess what it\nis. You might guess for ages, and be no nearer than you are now to the\ndiscovery of the truth. Your affectionate sister,\n\n\"NORAH BARTRAM.\"\n\n_(Added by Miss Garth.)_\n\n\"MY DEAR CHILD--If I had ever lost my old loving recollection of you,\nI should feel it in my heart again now, when I know that it has pleased\nGod to restore you to us from the brink of the grave. I add these lines\nto your sister's letter because I am not sure that you are quite so fit\nyet, as she thinks you, to accept her proposal. She has not said a\nword of her husband or herself which is not true. But Mr. Bartram is a\nstranger to you; and if you think you can recover more easily and more\npleasantly to yourself under the wing of your old governess than under\nthe protection of your new brother-in-law, come to me first, and trust\nto my reconciling Norah to the change of plans. I have secured the\nrefusal of a little cottage at Shanklin, near enough to your sister to\nallow of your seeing each other whenever you like, and far enough away,\nat the same time, to secure you the privilege, when you wish it, of\nbeing alone. Send me one line before we meet to say Yes or No, and I\nwill write to Shanklin by the next post.\n\n\"Always yours affectionately,\n\n\"HARRIET GARTH\"\n\n\nThe letter dropped from Magdalen's hand. Thoughts which had never risen\nin her mind yet rose in it now.\n\nNorah, whose courage under undeserved calamity had been the courage of\nresignation--Norah, who had patiently accepted her hard lot; who from\nfirst to last had meditated no vengeance and stooped to no deceit--Norah\nhad reached the end which all her sister's ingenuity, all her sister's\nresolution, and all her sister's daring had failed to achieve. Openly\nand honorably, with love on one side and love on the other, Norah had\nmarried the man who possessed the Combe-Raven money--and Magdalen's own\nscheme to recover it had opened the way to the event which had brought\nhusband and wife together.\n\nAs the light of that overwhelming discovery broke on her mind, the old\nstrife was renewed; and Good and Evil struggled once more which should\nwin her--but with added forces this time; with the new spirit that had\nbeen breathed into her new life; with the nobler sense that had grown\nwith the growth of her gratitude to the man who had saved her, fighting\non the better side. All the higher impulses of her nature, which had\nnever, from first to last, let her err with impunity--which had tortured\nher, before her marriage and after it, with the remorse that no woman\ninherently heartless and inherently wicked can feel--all the nobler\nelements in her character, gathered their forces for the crowning\nstruggle and strengthened her to meet, with no unworthy shrinking, the\nrevelation that had opened on her view. Clearer and clearer, in the\nlight of its own immortal life, the truth rose before her from the\nashes of her dead passions, from the grave of her buried hopes. When she\nlooked at the letter again--when she read the words once more which told\nher that the recovery of the lost fortune was her sister's triumph, not\nhers, she had victoriously trampled down all little jealousies and\nall mean regrets; she could say in her hearts of hearts, \"Norah has\ndeserved it!\"\n\nThe day wore on. She sat absorbed in her own thoughts, and heedless of\nthe second letter which she had not opened yet, until Kirke's return.\n\nHe stopped on the landing outside, and, opening the door a little way\nonly, asked, without entering the room, if she wanted anything that he\ncould send her. She begged him to come in. His face was worn and weary;\nhe looked older than she had seen him look yet. \"Did you put my letter\non the table for me?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. I put it there at the doctor's request.\"\n\n\"I suppose the doctor told you it was from my sister? She is coming to\nsee me, and Miss Garth is coming to see me. They will thank you for all\nyour goodness to me better than I can.\"\n\n\"I have no claim on their thanks,\" he answered, sternly. \"What I have\ndone was not done for them, but for you.\" He waited a little, and looked\nat her. His face would have betrayed him in that look, his voice would\nhave betrayed him in the next words he spoke, if she had not guessed\nthe truth already. \"When your friends come here,\" he resumed, \"they will\ntake you away, I suppose, to some better place than this.\"\n\n\"They can take me to no place,\" she said, gently, \"which I shall think\nof as I think of the place where you found me. They can take me to no\ndearer friend than the friend who saved my life.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence between them.\n\n\"We have been very happy here,\" he went on, in lower and lower tones.\n\"You won't forget me when we have said good-by?\"\n\nShe turned pale as the words passed his lips, and, leaving her chair,\nknelt down at the table, so as to look up into his face, and to force\nhim to look into hers.\n\n\"Why do you talk of it?\" she asked. \"We are not going to say good-by, at\nleast not yet.\"\n\n\"I thought--\" he began.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I thought your friends were coming here--\"\n\nShe eagerly interrupted him. \"Do you think I would go away with\nanybody,\" she said, \"even with the dearest relation I have in the world,\nand leave you here, not knowing and not caring whether I ever saw\nyou again? Oh, you don't think that of me!\" she exclaimed, with the\npassionate tears springing into her eyes-\"I'm sure you don't think that\nof me!\"\n\n\"No,\" he said; \"I never have thought, I never can think, unjustly or\nunworthily of you.\"\n\nBefore he could add another word she left the table as suddenly as\nshe had approached it, and returned to her chair. He had unconsciously\nreplied in terms that reminded her of the hard necessity which still\nremained unfulfilled--the necessity of telling him the story of the\npast. Not an idea of concealing that story from his knowledge crossed\nher mind. \"Will he love me, when he knows the truth, as he loves me\nnow?\" That was her only thought as she tried to approach the subject in\nhis presence without shrinking from it.\n\n\"Let us put my own feelings out of the question,\" she said. \"There is\na reason for my not going away, unless I first have the assurance of\nseeing you again. You have a claim--the strongest claim of any one--to\nknow how I came here, unknown to my friends, and how it was that you\nfound me fallen so low.\"\n\n\"I make no claim,\" he said, hastily. \"I wish to know nothing which\ndistresses you to tell me.\"\n\n\"You have always done your duty,\" she rejoined, with a faint smile. \"Let\nme take example from you, if I can, and try to do mine.\"\n\n\"I am old enough to be your father,\" he said, bitterly. \"Duty is more\neasily done at my age than it is at yours.\"\n\nHis age was so constantly in his mind now that he fancied it must be\nin her mind too. She had never given it a thought. The reference he\nhad just made to it did not divert her for a moment from the subject on\nwhich she was speaking to him.\n\n\"You don't know how I value your good opinion of me,\" she said,\nstruggling resolutely to sustain her sinking courage. \"How can I deserve\nyour kindness, how can I feel that I am worthy of your regard, until I\nhave opened my heart to you? Oh, don't encourage me in my own miserable\nweakness! Help me to tell the truth--_force_ me to tell it, for my own\nsake if not for yours!\"\n\nHe was deeply moved by the fervent sincerity of that appeal.\n\n\"You _shall_ tell it,\" he said. \"You are right--and I was wrong.\" He\nwaited a little, and considered. \"Would it be easier to you,\" he asked,\nwith delicate consideration for her, \"to write it than to tell it?\"\n\nShe caught gratefully at the suggestion. \"Far easier,\" she replied. \"I\ncan be sure of myself--I can be sure of hiding nothing from you, if I\nwrite it. Don't write to me on your side!\" she added, suddenly, seeing\nwith a woman's instinctive quickness of penetration the danger of\ntotally renouncing her personal influence over him. \"Wait till we meet,\nand tell me with your own lips what you think.\"\n\n\"Where shall I tell it?\"\n\n\"Here!\" she said eagerly. \"Here, where you found me helpless--here,\nwhere you have brought me back to life, and where I have first learned\nto know you. I can bear the hardest words you say to me if you will\nonly say them in this room. It is impossible I can be away longer than\na month; a month will be enough and more than enough. If I come back--\"\nShe stopped confusedly. \"I am thinking of myself,\" she said, \"when I\nought to be thinking of you. You have your own occupations and your own\nfriends. Will you decide for us? Will you say how it shall be?\"\n\n\"It shall be as you wish. If you come back in a month, you will find me\nhere.\"\n\n\"Will it cause you no sacrifice of your own comfort and your own plans?\"\n\n\"It will cause me nothing,\" he replied, \"but a journey back to the\nCity.\" He rose and took his hat. \"I must go there at once,\" he added,\n\"or I shall not be in time.\"\n\n\"It is a promise between us?\" she said, and held out her hand.\n\n\"Yes,\" he answered, a little sadly; \"it is a promise.\"\n\nSlight as it was, the shade of melancholy in his manner pained her.\nForgetting all other anxieties in the anxiety to cheer him, she gently\npressed the hand he gave her. \"If _that_ won't tell him the truth,\" she\nthought, \"nothing will.\"\n\nIt failed to tell him the truth; but it forced a question on his mind\nwhich he had not ventured to ask himself before. \"Is it her gratitude,\nor her love; that is speaking to me?\" he wondered. \"If I was only a\nyounger man, I might almost hope it was her love.\" That terrible sum in\nsubtraction which had first presented itself on the day when she told\nhim her age began to trouble him again as he left the house. He\ntook twenty from forty-one, at intervals, all the way back to the\nship-owners' office in Cornhill.\n\n\nLeft by herself, Magdalen approached the table to write the line of\nanswer which Miss Garth requested, and gratefully to accept the proposal\nthat had been made to her.\n\nThe second letter which she had laid aside and forgotten was the\nfirst object that caught her eye on changing her place. She opened\nit immediately, and, not recognizing the handwriting, looked at the\nsignature. To her unutterable astonishment, her correspondent proved to\nbe no less a person than--old Mr. Clare!\n\nThe philosopher's letter dispensed with all the ordinary forms of\naddress, and entered on the subject without prefatory phrases of any\nkind, in these uncompromising terms:\n\n\n\"I have more news for you of that contemptible cur, my son. Here it is\nin the fewest possible words.\n\n\"I always told you, if you remember, that Frank was a Sneak. The very\nfirst trace recovered of him, after his running away from his employers\nin China, presents him in that character. Where do you think he turns up\nnext? He turns up, hidden behind a couple of flour barrels, on board an\nEnglish vessel bound homeward from Hong-Kong to London.\n\n\"The name of the ship was the _Deliverance_, and the commander was one\nCaptain Kirke. Instead of acting like a sensible man, and throwing Frank\noverboard, Captain Kirke was fool enough to listen to his story. He made\nthe most of his misfortunes, you may be sure. He was half starved; he\nwas an Englishman lost in a strange country, without a friend to help\nhim; his only chance of getting home was to sneak into the hold of an\nEnglish vessel--and he had sneaked in, accordingly, at Hong-Kong, two\ndays since. That was his story. Any other lout in Frank's situation\nwould have been rope's ended by any other captain. Deserving no\npity from anybody, Frank was, as a matter of course, coddled and\ncompassionated on the spot. The captain took him by the hand, the crew\npitied him, and the passengers patted him on the back. He was fed,\nclothed, and presented with his passage home. Luck enough so far,\nyou will say. Nothing of the sort; nothing like luck enough for my\ndespicable son.\n\n\"The ship touched at the Cape of Good Hope. Among his other acts of\nfolly Captain Kirke took a woman passenger on board at that place--not\na young woman by any means--the elderly widow of a rich colonist. Is it\nnecessary to say that she forthwith became deeply interested in Frank\nand his misfortunes? Is it necessary to tell you what followed? Look\nback at my son's career, and you will see that what followed was all\nof a piece with what went before. He didn't deserve your poor father's\ninterest in him--and he got it. He didn't deserve your attachment--and\nhe got it. He didn't deserve the best place in one of the best offices\nin London; he didn't deserve an equally good chance in one of the best\nmercantile houses in China; he didn't deserve food, clothing, pity, and\na free passage home--and he got them all. Last, not least, he didn't\neven deserve to marry a woman old enough to be his grandmother--and he\nhas done it! Not five minutes since I sent his wedding-cards out to the\ndust-hole, and tossed the letter that came with them into the fire. The\nlast piece of information which that letter contains is that he and his\nwife are looking out for a house and estate to suit them. Mark my words!\nFrank will get one of the best estates in England; a seat in the House\nof Commons will follow as a matter of course; and one of the legislators\nof this Ass-ridden country will be--MY LOUT!\n\n\"If you are the sensible girl I have always taken you for, you have long\nsince learned to rate Frank at his true value, and the news I send you\nwill only confirm your contempt for him. I wish your poor father could\nbut have lived to see this day! Often as I have missed my old gossip, I\ndon't know that I ever felt the loss of him so keenly as I felt it\nwhen Frank's wedding-cards and Frank's letter came to this house. Your\nfriend, if you ever want one,\n\n\"FRANCIS CLARE, Sen.\"\n\n\nWith one momentary disturbance of her composure, produced by the\nappearance of Kirke's name in Mr. Clare's singular narrative, Magdalen\nread the letter steadily through from beginning to end. The time when it\ncould have distressed her was gone by; the scales had long since fallen\nfrom her eyes. Mr. Clare himself would have been satisfied if he had\nseen the quiet contempt on her face as she laid aside his letter.\nThe only serious thought it cost her was a thought in which Kirke was\nconcerned. The careless manner in which he had referred in her presence\nto the passengers on board his ship, without mentioning any of them by\ntheir names, showed her that Frank must have kept silence on the subject\nof the engagement once existing between them. The confession of that\nvanished delusion was left for her to make, as part of the story of the\npast which she had pledged herself unreservedly to reveal.\n\nShe wrote to Miss Garth, and sent the letter to the post immediately.\n\nThe next morning brought a line of rejoinder. Miss Garth had written\nto secure the cottage at Shanklin, and Mr. Merrick had consented to\nMagdalen's removal on the following day. Norah would be the first to\narrive at the house; and Miss Garth would follow, with a comfortable\ncarriage to take the invalid to the railway. Every needful arrangement\nhad been made for her; the effort of moving was the one effort she would\nhave to make.\n\nMagdalen read the letter thankfully, but her thoughts wandered from\nit, and followed Kirke on his return to the City. What was the business\nwhich had once already taken him there in the morning? And why had the\npromise exchanged between them obliged him to go to the City again, for\nthe second time in one day?\n\nWas it by any chance business relating to the sea? Were his employers\ntempting him to go back to his ship?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE first agitation of the meeting between the sisters was over; the\nfirst vivid impressions, half pleasurable, half painful, had softened a\nlittle, and Norah and Magdalen sat together hand in hand, each rapt in\nthe silent fullness of her own joy. Magdalen was the first to speak.\n\n\"You have something to tell me, Norah?\"\n\n\"I have a thousand things to tell you, my love; and you have ten\nthousand things to tell me.--Do you mean that second surprise which I\ntold you of in my letter?\"\n\n\"Yes. I suppose it must concern me very nearly, or you would hardly have\nthought of mentioning it in your first letter?\"\n\n\"It does concern you very nearly. You have heard of George's house in\nEssex? You must be familiar, at least, with the name of St. Crux?--What\nis there to start at, my dear? I am afraid you are hardly strong enough\nfor any more surprises just yet?\"\n\n\"Quite strong enough, Norah. I have something to say to you about St.\nCrux--I have a surprise, on my side, for _you._\"\n\n\"Will you tell it me now?\"\n\n\"Not now. You shall know it when we are at the seaside; you shall know\nit before I accept the kindness which has invited me to your husband's\nhouse.\"\n\n\"What _can_ it be? Why not tell me at once?\"\n\n\"You used often to set me the example of patience, Norah, in old times;\nwill you set me the example now?\"\n\n\"With all my heart. Shall I return to my own story as well? Yes? Then we\nwill go back to it at once. I was telling you that St. Crux is George's\nhouse, in Essex, the house he inherited from his uncle. Knowing that\nMiss Garth had a curiosity to see the place, he left word (when he went\nabroad after the admiral's death) that she and any friends who came\nwith her were to be admitted, if she happened to find herself in the\nneighborhood during his absence. Miss Garth and I, and a large party of\nMr. Tyrrel's friends, found ourselves in the neighborhood not long after\nGeorge's departure. We had all been invited to see the launch of Mr.\nTyrrel's new yacht from the builder's yard at Wivenhoe, in Essex. When\nthe launch was over, the rest of the company returned to Colchester to\ndine. Miss Garth and I contrived to get into the same carriage together,\nwith nobody but my two little pupils for our companions. We gave the\ncoachman his orders, and drove round by St. Crux. The moment Miss Garth\nmentioned her name we were let in, and shown all over the house. I don't\nknow how to describe it to you. It is the most bewildering place I ever\nsaw in my life--\"\n\n\"Don't attempt to describe it, Norah. Go on with your story instead.\"\n\n\"Very well. My story takes me straight into one of the rooms at St.\nCrux--a room about as long as your street here--so dreary, so dirty, and\nso dreadfully cold that I shiver at the bare recollection of it. Miss\nGarth was for getting out of it again as speedily as possible, and so\nwas I. But the housekeeper declined to let us off without first looking\nat a singular piece of furniture, the only piece of furniture in the\ncomfortless place. She called it a tripod, I think. (There is nothing\nto be alarmed at, Magdalen; I assure you there is nothing to be alarmed\nat!) At any rate, it was a strange, three-legged thing, which supported\na great panful of charcoal ashes at the top. It was considered by all\ngood judges (the housekeeper told us) a wonderful piece of chasing in\nmetal; and she especially pointed out the beauty of some scroll-work\nrunning round the inside of the pan, with Latin mottoes on it,\nsignifying--I forget what. I felt not the slightest interest in the\nthing myself, but I looked close at the scroll-work to satisfy the\nhousekeeper. To confess the truth, she was rather tiresome with her\nmechanically learned lecture on fine metal work; and, while she was\ntalking, I found myself idly stirring the soft feathery white ashes\nbackward and forward with my hand, pretending to listen, with my mind a\nhundred miles away from her. I don't know how long or how short a time I\nhad been playing with the ashes, when my fingers suddenly encountered\na piece of crumpled paper hidden deep among them. When I brought it to\nthe surface, it proved to be a letter--a long letter full of cramped,\nclose writing.--You have anticipated my story, Magdalen, before I can\nend it! You know as well as I do that the letter which my idle fingers\nfound was the Secret Trust. Hold out your hand, my dear. I have got\nGeorge's permission to show it to you, and there it is!\"\n\nShe put the Trust into her sister's hand. Magdalen took it from\nher mechanically. \"You!\" she said, looking at her sister with the\nremembrance of all that she had vainly ventured, of all that she had\nvainly suffered, at St. Crux--\"_you_ have found it!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Norah, gayly; \"the Trust has proved no exception to the\ngeneral perversity of all lost things. Look for them, and they remain\ninvisible. Leave them alone, and they reveal themselves! You and your\nlawyer, Magdalen, were both justified in supposing that your interest\nin this discovery was an interest of no common kind. I spare you all our\nconsultations after I had produced the crumpled paper from the ashes. It\nended in George's lawyer being written to, and in George himself being\nrecalled from the Continent. Miss Garth and I both saw him immediately\non his return. He did what neither of us could do--he solved the mystery\nof the Trust being hidden in the charcoal ashes. Admiral Bartram, you\nmust know, was all his life subject to fits of somnambulism. He had been\nfound walking in his sleep not long before his death--just at the time,\ntoo, when he was sadly troubled in his mind on the subject of that very\nletter in your hand. George's idea is that he must have fancied he was\ndoing in his sleep what he would have died rather than do in his waking\nmoments--destroying the Trust. The fire had been lighted in the pan not\nlong before, and he no doubt saw it still burning in his dream. This\nwas George's explanation of the strange position of the letter when\nI discovered it. The question of what was to be done with the letter\nitself came next, and was no easy question for a woman to understand.\nBut I determined to master it, and I did master it, because it related\nto you.\"\n\n\"Let me try to master it, in my turn,\" said Magdalen. \"I have a\nparticular reason for wishing to know as much about this letter as you\nknow yourself. What has it done for others, and what is it to do for\nme?\"\n\n\"My dear Magdalen, how strangely you look at it! how strangely you talk\nof it! Worthless as it may appear, that morsel of paper gives you a\nfortune.\"\n\n\"Is my only claim to the fortune the claim which this letter gives me?\"\n\n\"Yes; the letter is your only claim. Shall I try if I can explain it in\ntwo words? Taken by itself, the letter might, in the lawyer's opinion,\nhave been made a matter for dispute, though I am sure George would\nhave sanctioned no proceeding of that sort. Taken, however, with the\npostscript which Admiral Bartram attached to it (you will see the lines\nif you look under the signature on the third page), it becomes legally\nbinding, as well as morally binding, on the admiral's representatives.\nI have exhausted my small stock of legal words, and must go on in my\nown language instead of in the lawyer's. The end of the thing was simply\nthis. All the money went back to Mr. Noel Vanstone's estate (another\nlegal word! my vocabulary is richer than I thought), for one plain\nreason--that it had not been employed as Mr. Noel Vanstone directed.\nIf Mrs. Girdlestone had lived, or if George had married me a few months\nearlier, results would have been just the other way. As it is, half the\nmoney has been already divided between Mr. Noel Vanstone's next of kin;\nwhich means, translated into plain English, my husband, and his poor\nbedridden sister--who took the money formally, one day, to satisfy the\nlawyer, and who gave it back again generously, the next, to satisfy\nherself. So much for one half of this legacy. The other half, my dear,\nis all yours. How strangely events happen, Magdalen! It is only two\nyears since you and I were left disinherited orphans--and we are sharing\nour poor father's fortune between us, after all!\"\n\n\"Wait a little, Norah. Our shares come to us in very different ways.\"\n\n\"Do they? Mine comes to me by my husband. Yours comes to you--\" She\nstopped confusedly, and changed color. \"Forgive me, my own love!\" she\nsaid, putting Magdalen's hand to her lips. \"I have forgotten what I\nought to have remembered. I have thoughtlessly distressed you!\"\n\n\"No!\" said Magdalen; \"you have encouraged me.\"\n\n\"Encouraged you?\"\n\n\"You shall see.\"\n\nWith those words, she rose quietly from the sofa, and walked to the open\nwindow. Before Norah could follow her, she had torn the Trust to pieces,\nand had cast the fragments into the street.\n\nShe came back to the sofa and laid her head, with a deep sigh of relief,\non Norah's bosom. \"I will owe nothing to my past life,\" she said. \"I\nhave parted with it as I have parted with those torn morsels of paper.\nAll the thoughts and all the hopes belonging to it are put away from me\nforever!\"\n\n\"Magdalen, my husband will never allow you! I will never allow you\nmyself--\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! What your husband thinks right, Norah, you and I will think\nright too. I will take from _you_ what I would never have taken if that\nletter had given it to me. The end I dreamed of has come. Nothing is\nchanged but the position I once thought we might hold toward each other.\nBetter as it is, my love--far, far better as it is!\"\n\nSo she made the last sacrifice of the old perversity and the old pride.\nSo she entered on the new and nobler life.\n\n* * * * * *\n\nA month had passed. The autumn sunshine was bright even in the murky\nstreets, and the clocks in the neighborhood were just striking two, as\nMagdalen returned alone to the house in Aaron's Buildings.\n\n\"Is he waiting for me?\" she asked, anxiously, when the landlady let her\nin.\n\nHe was waiting in the front room. Magdalen stole up the stairs and\nknocked at the door. He called to her carelessly and absently to come\nin, plainly thinking that it was only the servant who applied for\npermission to enter the room.\n\n\"You hardly expected me so soon?\" she said speaking on the threshold,\nand pausing there to enjoy his surprise as he started to his feet and\nlooked at her.\n\nThe only traces of illness still visible in her face left a delicacy in\nits outline which added refinement to her beauty. She was simply dressed\nin muslin. Her plain straw bonnet had no other ornament than the\nwhite ribbon with which it was sparingly trimmed. She had never looked\nlovelier in her best days than she looked now, as she advanced to the\ntable at which he had been sitting, with a little basket of flowers that\nshe had brought with her from the country, and offered him her hand.\n\nHe looked anxious and careworn when she saw him closer. She interrupted\nhis first inquiries and congratulations to ask if he had remained in\nLondon since they had parted--if he had not even gone away, for a few\ndays only, to see his friends in Suffolk? No; he had been in London\never since. He never told her that the pretty parsonage house in Suffolk\nwanted all those associations with herself in which the poor four walls\nat Aaron's Buildings were so rich. He only said he had been in London\never since.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she asked, looking him attentively in the face, \"if you are\nas happy to see me again as I am to see you?\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am even happier, in my different way,\" he answered, with a\nsmile.\n\nShe took off her bonnet and scarf, and seated herself once more in her\nown arm-chair. \"I suppose this street is very ugly,\" she said; \"and I am\nsure nobody can deny that the house is very small. And yet--and yet it\nfeels like coming home again. Sit there where you used to sit; tell me\nabout yourself. I want to know all that you have done, all that you have\nthought even, while I have been away.\" She tried to resume the endless\nsuccession of questions by means of which she was accustomed to lure him\ninto speaking of himself. But she put them far less spontaneously, far\nless adroitly, than usual. Her one all-absorbing anxiety in entering\nthat room was not an anxiety to be trifled with. After a quarter of an\nhour wasted in constrained inquiries on one side, in reluctant replies\non the other, she ventured near the dangerous subject at last.\n\n\"Have you received the letters I wrote to you from the seaside?\" she\nasked, suddenly looking away from him for the first time.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said; \"all.\"\n\n\"Have you read them?\"\n\n\"Every one of them--many times over.\"\n\nHer heart beat as if it would suffocate her. She had kept her promise\nbravely. The whole story of her life, from the time of the home-wreck at\nCombe-Raven to the time when she had destroyed the Secret Trust in her\nsister's presence, had been all laid before him. Nothing that she had\ndone, nothing even that she had thought, had been concealed from his\nknowledge. As he would have kept a pledged engagement with her, so she\nhad kept her pledged engagement with him. She had not faltered in\nthe resolution to do this; and now she faltered over the one decisive\nquestion which she had come there to ask. Strong as the desire in her\nwas to know if she had lost or won him, the fear of knowing was at that\nmoment stronger still. She waited and trembled; she waited, and said no\nmore.\n\n\"May I speak to you about your letters?\" he asked. \"May I tell you--?\"\n\nIf she had looked at him as he said those few words, she would have seen\nwhat he thought of her in his face. She would have seen, innocent as\nhe was in this world's knowledge, that he knew the priceless value, the\nall-ennobling virtue, of a woman who speaks the truth. But she had no\ncourage to look at him--no courage to raise her eyes from her lap.\n\n\"Not just yet,\" she said, faintly. \"Not quite so soon after we have met\nagain.\"\n\nShe rose hurriedly from her chair, and walked to the window, turned back\nagain into the room, and approached the table, close to where he was\nsitting. The writing materials scattered near him offered her a pretext\nfor changing the subject, and she seized on it directly. \"Were you\nwriting a letter,\" she asked, \"when I came in?\"\n\n\"I was thinking about it,\" he replied. \"It was not a letter to be\nwritten without thinking first.\" He rose as he answered her to gather\nthe writing materials together and put them away.\n\n\"Why should I interrupt you?\" she said. \"Why not let me try whether I\ncan't help you instead? Is it a secret?\"\n\n\"No, not a secret.\"\n\nHe hesitated as he answered her. She instantly guessed the truth.\n\n\"Is it about your ship?\"\n\nHe little knew how she had been thinking in her absence from him of the\nbusiness which he believed that he had concealed from her. He little\nknew that she had learned already to be jealous of his ship. \"Do they\nwant you to return to your old life?\" she went on. \"Do they want you to\ngo back to the sea? Must you say Yes or No at once?\"\n\n\"At once.\"\n\n\"If I had not come in when I did would you have said Yes?\"\n\nShe unconsciously laid her hand on his arm, forgetting all inferior\nconsiderations in her breathless anxiety to hear his next words. The\nconfession of his love was within a hair-breadth of escaping him; but\nhe checked the utterance of it even yet. \"I don't care for myself,\" he\nthought; \"but how can I be certain of not distressing _her?_\"\n\n\"Would you have said Yes?\" she repeated.\n\n\"I was doubting,\" he answered--\"I was doubting between Yes and No.\"\n\nHer hand tightened on his arm; a sudden trembling seized her in every\nlimb, she could bear it no longer. All her heart went out to him in her\nnext words:\n\n\"Were you doubting _for my sake?\"_\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Take my confession in return for yours--I was doubting\nfor your sake.\"\n\nShe said no more; she only looked at him. In that look the truth reached\nhim at last. The next instant she was folded in his arms, and was\nshedding delicious tears of joy, with her face hidden on his bosom.\n\n\"Do I deserve my happiness?\" she murmured, asking the one question at\nlast. \"Oh, I know how the poor narrow people who have never felt and\nnever suffered would answer me if I asked them what I ask you. If _they_\nknew my story, they would forget all the provocation, and only remember\nthe offense; they would fasten on my sin, and pass all my suffering\nby. But you are not one of them! Tell me if you have any shadow of a\nmisgiving! Tell me if you doubt that the one dear object of all my life\nto come is to live worthy of you! I asked you to wait and see me; I\nasked you, if there was any hard truth to be told, to tell it me here\nwith your own lips. Tell it, my love, my husband!--tell it me now!\"\n\nShe looked up, still clinging to him as she clung to the hope of her\nbetter life to come.\n\n\"Tell me the truth!\" she repeated.\n\n\"With my own lips?\"\n\n\"Yes!\" she answered, eagerly. \"Say what you think of me with your own\nlips.\"\n\nHe stooped and kissed her.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of No Name, by Wilkie Collins\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK NO NAME ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1438.txt or 1438.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/4\/3\/1438\/\n\nProduced by James Rusk and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":537,"split":"train"}
