{"ori_id":"67161aa1a00a7151b4b0d43229d177363f8c5568","title":"Madame Bovary","context":"Madame Bovary\n Madame Bovary takes place in provincial northern France, near the town of Rouen in Normandy. Charles Bovary is a shy, oddly dressed teenager arriving at a new school where his new classmates ridicule him. Charles struggles his way to a second-rate medical degree and becomes an officier de sant\u00e9 in the Public Health Service. He marries the woman his mother has chosen for him, the unpleasant but supposedly rich widow Heloise Dubuc. He sets out to build a practice in the village of Tostes (now T\u00f4tes).\nOne day, Charles visits a local farm to set the owner's broken leg and meets his patient's daughter, Emma Rouault. Emma is a beautiful, daintily dressed young woman who has received a \"good education\" in a convent. She has a powerful yearning for luxury and romance inspired by reading popular novels. Charles is immediately attracted to her and visits his patient far more often than necessary until Heloise's jealousy puts a stop to the visits. When Heloise dies, Charles waits a decent interval before courting Emma in earnest. Her father gives his consent, and Emma and Charles marry.\nThe novel's focus shifts to Emma. Charles means well but is plodding and clumsy. After he and Emma attend an elegant ball given by the Marquis d'Andervilliers, Emma finds her married life dull and becomes listless. Charles decides his wife needs a change of scenery and moves his practice to the larger market town of Yonville (traditionally identified with the town of Ry). There, Emma gives birth to a daughter, Berthe, but motherhood proves a disappointment to Emma. She becomes infatuated with an intelligent young man she meets in Yonville, a young law student, L\u00e9on Dupuis, who shares her appreciation for literature and music and returns her esteem. Concerned with maintaining her self-image as a devoted wife and mother, Emma does not acknowledge her passion for L\u00e9on and conceals her contempt for Charles, drawing comfort from the thought of her virtue. L\u00e9on despairs of gaining Emma's affection and departs to study in Paris.\nOne day, a rich and rakish landowner, Rodolphe Boulanger, brings a servant to the doctor's office to be bled. He casts his eye over Emma and imagines she will be easily seduced. He invites her to go riding with him for the sake of her health. Charles, solicitous for his wife's health and not at all suspicious, embraces the plan. Emma and Rodolphe begin an affair. She, consumed by her romantic fantasy, risks compromising herself with indiscreet letters and visits to her lover. After four years, she insists they run away together. Rodolphe does not share her enthusiasm for this plan and on the eve of their planned departure, he ends the relationship with an apologetic, self-effacing letter placed at the bottom of a basket of apricots he has delivered to Emma. The shock is so great that Emma falls deathly ill and briefly turns to religion.\nWhen Emma is nearly fully recovered, she and Charles attend the opera, at Charles' insistence, in nearby Rouen. The opera reawakens Emma's passions, and she encounters L\u00e9on who, now educated and working in Rouen, is also attending the opera. They begin an affair. While Charles believes that she is taking piano lessons, Emma travels to the city each week to meet L\u00e9on, always in the same room of the same hotel, which the two come to view as their home. The love affair is ecstatic at first, but L\u00e9on grows bored with Emma's emotional excesses, and Emma grows ambivalent about L\u00e9on. Emma indulges her fancy for luxury goods with purchases made on credit from the crafty merchant Lheureux, who arranges for her to obtain power of attorney over Charles' estate. Emma's debt steadily mounts.\nWhen Lheureux calls in Bovary's debt, Emma pleads for money from several people, including L\u00e9on and Rodolphe, only to be turned down. In despair, she swallows arsenic and dies an agonizing death. Charles, heartbroken, abandons himself to grief, preserves Emma's room as a shrine, and adopts her attitudes and tastes to keep her memory alive. In his last months, he stops working and lives by selling off his possessions. When he finds Rodolphe and L\u00e9on's love letters, he still tries to understand and forgive her. His remaining possessions are seized to pay off Lheureux. He dies, and his young daughter Berthe is placed with her grandmother, who soon dies. Berthe then lives with an impoverished aunt, who sends her to work in a cotton mill. The book concludes with the local pharmacist Homais, who had competed with Charles's medical practice, gaining prominence among Yonville people and being awarded for his medical achievements.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Madame Bovary, by Gustave Flaubert\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Reading over your magnificent defence, my work has\nacquired for myself, as it were, an unexpected authority.\n\nAccept, then, here, the homage of my gratitude, which, how great soever\nit is, will never attain the height of your eloquence and your devotion.\n\nGustave Flaubert Paris, 12 April 1857\n\n\n\n\nMADAME BOVARY\n\n\n\n\nPart I\n\n\n\nChapter One\n\nWe were in class when the head-master came in, followed by a \"new\nfellow,\" not wearing the school uniform, and a school servant carrying a\nlarge desk. Those who had been asleep woke up, and every one rose as if\njust surprised at his work.\n\nThe head-master made a sign to us to sit down. Then, turning to the\nclass-master, he said to him in a low voice--\n\n\"Monsieur Roger, here is a pupil whom I recommend to your care; he'll be\nin the second. If his work and conduct are satisfactory, he will go into\none of the upper classes, as becomes his age.\"\n\nThe \"new fellow,\" standing in the corner behind the door so that he\ncould hardly be seen, was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller\nthan any of us. His hair was cut square on his forehead like a village\nchorister's; he looked reliable, but very ill at ease. Although he was\nnot broad-shouldered, his short school jacket of green cloth with black\nbuttons must have been tight about the arm-holes, and showed at the\nopening of the cuffs red wrists accustomed to being bare. His legs, in\nblue stockings, looked out from beneath yellow trousers, drawn tight by\nbraces, He wore stout, ill-cleaned, hob-nailed boots.\n\nWe began repeating the lesson. He listened with all his ears, as\nattentive as if at a sermon, not daring even to cross his legs or lean\non his elbow; and when at two o'clock the bell rang, the master was\nobliged to tell him to fall into line with the rest of us.\n\nWhen we came back to work, we were in the habit of throwing our caps on\nthe ground so as to have our hands more free; we used from the door to\ntoss them under the form, so that they hit against the wall and made a\nlot of dust: it was \"the thing.\"\n\nBut, whether he had not noticed the trick, or did not dare to attempt\nit, the \"new fellow,\" was still holding his cap on his knees even after\nprayers were over. It was one of those head-gears of composite order, in\nwhich we can find traces of the bearskin, shako, billycock hat, sealskin\ncap, and cotton night-cap; one of those poor things, in fine, whose\ndumb ugliness has depths of expression, like an imbecile's face. Oval,\nstiffened with whalebone, it began with three round knobs; then came in\nsuccession lozenges of velvet and rabbit-skin separated by a red band;\nafter that a sort of bag that ended in a cardboard polygon covered with\ncomplicated braiding, from which hung, at the end of a long thin cord,\nsmall twisted gold threads in the manner of a tassel. The cap was new;\nits peak shone.\n\n\"Rise,\" said the master.\n\nHe stood up; his cap fell. The whole class began to laugh. He stooped to\npick it up. A neighbor knocked it down again with his elbow; he picked\nit up once more.\n\n\"Get rid of your helmet,\" said the master, who was a bit of a wag.\n\nThere was a burst of laughter from the boys, which so thoroughly put the\npoor lad out of countenance that he did not know whether to keep his cap\nin his hand, leave it on the ground, or put it on his head. He sat down\nagain and placed it on his knee.\n\n\"Rise,\" repeated the master, \"and tell me your name.\"\n\nThe new boy articulated in a stammering voice an unintelligible name.\n\n\"Again!\"\n\nThe same sputtering of syllables was heard, drowned by the tittering of\nthe class.\n\n\"Louder!\" cried the master; \"louder!\"\n\nThe \"new fellow\" then took a supreme resolution, opened an inordinately\nlarge mouth, and shouted at the top of his voice as if calling someone\nin the word \"Charbovari.\"\n\nA hubbub broke out, rose in crescendo with bursts of shrill voices (they\nyelled, barked, stamped, repeated \"Charbovari! Charbovari\"), then died\naway into single notes, growing quieter only with great difficulty, and\nnow and again suddenly recommencing along the line of a form whence rose\nhere and there, like a damp cracker going off, a stifled laugh.\n\nHowever, amid a rain of impositions, order was gradually re-established\nin the class; and the master having succeeded in catching the name of\n\"Charles Bovary,\" having had it dictated to him, spelt out, and re-read,\nat once ordered the poor devil to go and sit down on the punishment form\nat the foot of the master's desk. He got up, but before going hesitated.\n\n\"What are you looking for?\" asked the master.\n\n\"My c-a-p,\" timidly said the \"new fellow,\" casting troubled looks round\nhim.\n\n\"Five hundred lines for all the class!\" shouted in a furious voice\nstopped, like the Quos ego*, a fresh outburst. \"Silence!\" continued the\nmaster indignantly, wiping his brow with his handkerchief, which he\nhad just taken from his cap. \"As to you, 'new boy,' you will conjugate\n'ridiculus sum'** twenty times.\"\n\nThen, in a gentler tone, \"Come, you'll find your cap again; it hasn't\nbeen stolen.\"\n\n     *A quotation from the Aeneid signifying a threat.\n\n     **I am ridiculous.\n\nQuiet was restored. Heads bent over desks, and the \"new fellow\" remained\nfor two hours in an exemplary attitude, although from time to time some\npaper pellet flipped from the tip of a pen came bang in his face. But he\nwiped his face with one hand and continued motionless, his eyes lowered.\n\nIn the evening, at preparation, he pulled out his pens from his desk,\narranged his small belongings, and carefully ruled his paper. We saw him\nworking conscientiously, looking up every word in the dictionary, and\ntaking the greatest pains. Thanks, no doubt, to the willingness he\nshowed, he had not to go down to the class below. But though he knew his\nrules passably, he had little finish in composition. It was the cure\nof his village who had taught him his first Latin; his parents, from\nmotives of economy, having sent him to school as late as possible.\n\nHis father, Monsieur Charles Denis Bartolome Bovary, retired\nassistant-surgeon-major, compromised about 1812 in certain conscription\nscandals, and forced at this time to leave the service, had taken\nadvantage of his fine figure to get hold of a dowry of sixty thousand\nfrancs that offered in the person of a hosier's daughter who had fallen\nin love with his good looks. A fine man, a great talker, making his\nspurs ring as he walked, wearing whiskers that ran into his moustache,\nhis fingers always garnished with rings and dressed in loud colours,\nhe had the dash of a military man with the easy go of a commercial\ntraveller.\n\nOnce married, he lived for three or four years on his wife's fortune,\ndining well, rising late, smoking long porcelain pipes, not coming in\nat night till after the theatre, and haunting cafes. The father-in-law\ndied, leaving little; he was indignant at this, \"went in for the\nbusiness,\" lost some money in it, then retired to the country, where he\nthought he would make money.\n\nBut, as he knew no more about farming than calico, as he rode his horses\ninstead of sending them to plough, drank his cider in bottle instead of\nselling it in cask, ate the finest poultry in his farmyard, and greased\nhis hunting-boots with the fat of his pigs, he was not long in finding\nout that he would do better to give up all speculation.\n\nFor two hundred francs a year he managed to live on the border of\nthe provinces of Caux and Picardy, in a kind of place half farm, half\nprivate house; and here, soured, eaten up with regrets, cursing his\nluck, jealous of everyone, he shut himself up at the age of forty-five,\nsick of men, he said, and determined to live at peace.\n\nHis wife had adored him once on a time; she had bored him with a\nthousand servilities that had only estranged him the more. Lively once,\nexpansive and affectionate, in growing older she had become (after the\nfashion of wine that, exposed to air, turns to vinegar) ill-tempered,\ngrumbling, irritable. She had suffered so much without complaint at\nfirst, until she had seem him going after all the village drabs, and\nuntil a score of bad houses sent him back to her at night, weary,\nstinking drunk. Then her pride revolted. After that she was silent,\nburying her anger in a dumb stoicism that she maintained till her death.\nShe was constantly going about looking after business matters. She\ncalled on the lawyers, the president, remembered when bills fell due,\ngot them renewed, and at home ironed, sewed, washed, looked after the\nworkmen, paid the accounts, while he, troubling himself about nothing,\neternally besotted in sleepy sulkiness, whence he only roused himself\nto say disagreeable things to her, sat smoking by the fire and spitting\ninto the cinders.\n\nWhen she had a child, it had to be sent out to nurse. When he came home,\nthe lad was spoilt as if he were a prince. His mother stuffed him\nwith jam; his father let him run about barefoot, and, playing the\nphilosopher, even said he might as well go about quite naked like the\nyoung of animals. As opposed to the maternal ideas, he had a certain\nvirile idea of childhood on which he sought to mould his son, wishing\nhim to be brought up hardily, like a Spartan, to give him a strong\nconstitution. He sent him to bed without any fire, taught him to drink\noff large draughts of rum and to jeer at religious processions. But,\npeaceable by nature, the lad answered only poorly to his notions. His\nmother always kept him near her; she cut out cardboard for him, told him\ntales, entertained him with endless monologues full of melancholy gaiety\nand charming nonsense. In her life's isolation she centered on the\nchild's head all her shattered, broken little vanities. She dreamed of\nhigh station; she already saw him, tall, handsome, clever, settled as\nan engineer or in the law. She taught him to read, and even, on an old\npiano, she had taught him two or three little songs. But to all this\nMonsieur Bovary, caring little for letters, said, \"It was not worth\nwhile. Would they ever have the means to send him to a public school, to\nbuy him a practice, or start him in business? Besides, with cheek a man\nalways gets on in the world.\" Madame Bovary bit her lips, and the child\nknocked about the village.\n\nHe went after the labourers, drove away with clods of earth the ravens\nthat were flying about. He ate blackberries along the hedges, minded the\ngeese with a long switch, went haymaking during harvest, ran about in\nthe woods, played hop-scotch under the church porch on rainy days, and\nat great fetes begged the beadle to let him toll the bells, that he\nmight hang all his weight on the long rope and feel himself borne upward\nby it in its swing. Meanwhile he grew like an oak; he was strong on\nhand, fresh of colour.\n\nWhen he was twelve years old his mother had her own way; he began\nlessons. The cure took him in hand; but the lessons were so short and\nirregular that they could not be of much use. They were given at spare\nmoments in the sacristy, standing up, hurriedly, between a baptism and\na burial; or else the cure, if he had not to go out, sent for his pupil\nafter the Angelus*. They went up to his room and settled down; the\nflies and moths fluttered round the candle. It was close, the child\nfell asleep, and the good man, beginning to doze with his hands on his\nstomach, was soon snoring with his mouth wide open. On other occasions,\nwhen Monsieur le Cure, on his way back after administering the viaticum\nto some sick person in the neighbourhood, caught sight of Charles\nplaying about the fields, he called him, lectured him for a quarter of\nan hour and took advantage of the occasion to make him conjugate his\nverb at the foot of a tree. The rain interrupted them or an acquaintance\npassed. All the same he was always pleased with him, and even said the\n\"young man\" had a very good memory.\n\n     *A devotion said at morning, noon, and evening, at the sound\n     of a bell. Here, the evening prayer.\n\nCharles could not go on like this. Madame Bovary took strong steps.\nAshamed, or rather tired out, Monsieur Bovary gave in without a\nstruggle, and they waited one year longer, so that the lad should take\nhis first communion.\n\nSix months more passed, and the year after Charles was finally sent to\nschool at Rouen, where his father took him towards the end of October,\nat the time of the St. Romain fair.\n\nIt would now be impossible for any of us to remember anything about him.\nHe was a youth of even temperament, who played in playtime, worked in\nschool-hours, was attentive in class, slept well in the dormitory,\nand ate well in the refectory. He had in loco parentis* a wholesale\nironmonger in the Rue Ganterie, who took him out once a month on Sundays\nafter his shop was shut, sent him for a walk on the quay to look at\nthe boats, and then brought him back to college at seven o'clock before\nsupper. Every Thursday evening he wrote a long letter to his mother with\nred ink and three wafers; then he went over his history note-books, or\nread an old volume of \"Anarchasis\" that was knocking about the study.\nWhen he went for walks he talked to the servant, who, like himself, came\nfrom the country.\n\n     *In place of a parent.\n\nBy dint of hard work he kept always about the middle of the class; once\neven he got a certificate in natural history. But at the end of his\nthird year his parents withdrew him from the school to make him study\nmedicine, convinced that he could even take his degree by himself.\n\nHis mother chose a room for him on the fourth floor of a dyer's she\nknew, overlooking the Eau-de-Robec. She made arrangements for his\nboard, got him furniture, table and two chairs, sent home for an old\ncherry-tree bedstead, and bought besides a small cast-iron stove with\nthe supply of wood that was to warm the poor child.\n\nThen at the end of a week she departed, after a thousand injunctions to\nbe good now that he was going to be left to himself.\n\nThe syllabus that he read on the notice-board stunned him; lectures\non anatomy, lectures on pathology, lectures on physiology, lectures on\npharmacy, lectures on botany and clinical medicine, and therapeutics,\nwithout counting hygiene and materia medica--all names of whose\netymologies he was ignorant, and that were to him as so many doors to\nsanctuaries filled with magnificent darkness.\n\nHe understood nothing of it all; it was all very well to listen--he did\nnot follow. Still he worked; he had bound note-books, he attended all\nthe courses, never missed a single lecture. He did his little daily task\nlike a mill-horse, who goes round and round with his eyes bandaged, not\nknowing what work he is doing.\n\nTo spare him expense his mother sent him every week by the carrier a\npiece of veal baked in the oven, with which he lunched when he came back\nfrom the hospital, while he sat kicking his feet against the wall.\nAfter this he had to run off to lectures, to the operation-room, to the\nhospital, and return to his home at the other end of the town. In the\nevening, after the poor dinner of his landlord, he went back to his\nroom and set to work again in his wet clothes, which smoked as he sat in\nfront of the hot stove.\n\nOn the fine summer evenings, at the time when the close streets are\nempty, when the servants are playing shuttle-cock at the doors, he\nopened his window and leaned out. The river, that makes of this quarter\nof Rouen a wretched little Venice, flowed beneath him, between the\nbridges and the railings, yellow, violet, or blue. Working men, kneeling\non the banks, washed their bare arms in the water. On poles projecting\nfrom the attics, skeins of cotton were drying in the air. Opposite,\nbeyond the roots spread the pure heaven with the red sun setting. How\npleasant it must be at home! How fresh under the beech-tree! And he\nexpanded his nostrils to breathe in the sweet odours of the country\nwhich did not reach him.\n\nHe grew thin, his figure became taller, his face took a saddened look\nthat made it nearly interesting. Naturally, through indifference, he\nabandoned all the resolutions he had made. Once he missed a lecture; the\nnext day all the lectures; and, enjoying his idleness, little by little,\nhe gave up work altogether. He got into the habit of going to the\npublic-house, and had a passion for dominoes. To shut himself up every\nevening in the dirty public room, to push about on marble tables the\nsmall sheep bones with black dots, seemed to him a fine proof of his\nfreedom, which raised him in his own esteem. It was beginning to see\nlife, the sweetness of stolen pleasures; and when he entered, he put\nhis hand on the door-handle with a joy almost sensual. Then many things\nhidden within him came out; he learnt couplets by heart and sang them to\nhis boon companions, became enthusiastic about Beranger, learnt how to\nmake punch, and, finally, how to make love.\n\nThanks to these preparatory labours, he failed completely in his\nexamination for an ordinary degree. He was expected home the same night\nto celebrate his success. He started on foot, stopped at the beginning\nof the village, sent for his mother, and told her all. She excused\nhim, threw the blame of his failure on the injustice of the examiners,\nencouraged him a little, and took upon herself to set matters straight.\nIt was only five years later that Monsieur Bovary knew the truth; it was\nold then, and he accepted it. Moreover, he could not believe that a man\nborn of him could be a fool.\n\nSo Charles set to work again and crammed for his examination,\nceaselessly learning all the old questions by heart. He passed pretty\nwell. What a happy day for his mother! They gave a grand dinner.\n\nWhere should he go to practice? To Tostes, where there was only one old\ndoctor. For a long time Madame Bovary had been on the look-out for his\ndeath, and the old fellow had barely been packed off when Charles was\ninstalled, opposite his place, as his successor.\n\nBut it was not everything to have brought up a son, to have had him\ntaught medicine, and discovered Tostes, where he could practice it;\nhe must have a wife. She found him one--the widow of a bailiff at\nDieppe--who was forty-five and had an income of twelve hundred francs.\nThough she was ugly, as dry as a bone, her face with as many pimples as\nthe spring has buds, Madame Dubuc had no lack of suitors. To attain her\nends Madame Bovary had to oust them all, and she even succeeded in\nvery cleverly baffling the intrigues of a port-butcher backed up by the\npriests.\n\nCharles had seen in marriage the advent of an easier life, thinking he\nwould be more free to do as he liked with himself and his money. But his\nwife was master; he had to say this and not say that in company, to fast\nevery Friday, dress as she liked, harass at her bidding those patients\nwho did not pay. She opened his letter, watched his comings and goings,\nand listened at the partition-wall when women came to consult him in his\nsurgery.\n\nShe must have her chocolate every morning, attentions without end. She\nconstantly complained of her nerves, her chest, her liver. The noise of\nfootsteps made her ill; when people left her, solitude became odious to\nher; if they came back, it was doubtless to see her die. When Charles\nreturned in the evening, she stretched forth two long thin arms from\nbeneath the sheets, put them round his neck, and having made him sit\ndown on the edge of the bed, began to talk to him of her troubles: he\nwas neglecting her, he loved another. She had been warned she would be\nunhappy; and she ended by asking him for a dose of medicine and a little\nmore love.\n\n\n\nChapter Two\n\nOne night towards eleven o'clock they were awakened by the noise of\na horse pulling up outside their door. The servant opened the\ngarret-window and parleyed for some time with a man in the street below.\nHe came for the doctor, had a letter for him. Natasie came downstairs\nshivering and undid the bars and bolts one after the other. The man left\nhis horse, and, following the servant, suddenly came in behind her. He\npulled out from his wool cap with grey top-knots a letter wrapped up in\na rag and presented it gingerly to Charles, who rested on his elbow on\nthe pillow to read it. Natasie, standing near the bed, held the light.\nMadame in modesty had turned to the wall and showed only her back.\n\nThis letter, sealed with a small seal in blue wax, begged Monsieur\nBovary to come immediately to the farm of the Bertaux to set a broken\nleg. Now from Tostes to the Bertaux was a good eighteen miles across\ncountry by way of Longueville and Saint-Victor. It was a dark night;\nMadame Bovary junior was afraid of accidents for her husband. So it was\ndecided the stable-boy should go on first; Charles would start three\nhours later when the moon rose. A boy was to be sent to meet him, and\nshow him the way to the farm, and open the gates for him.\n\nTowards four o'clock in the morning, Charles, well wrapped up in his\ncloak, set out for the Bertaux. Still sleepy from the warmth of his bed,\nhe let himself be lulled by the quiet trot of his horse. When it stopped\nof its own accord in front of those holes surrounded with thorns that\nare dug on the margin of furrows, Charles awoke with a start, suddenly\nremembered the broken leg, and tried to call to mind all the fractures\nhe knew. The rain had stopped, day was breaking, and on the branches\nof the leafless trees birds roosted motionless, their little feathers\nbristling in the cold morning wind. The flat country stretched as far as\neye could see, and the tufts of trees round the farms at long intervals\nseemed like dark violet stains on the cast grey surface, that on the\nhorizon faded into the gloom of the sky.\n\nCharles from time to time opened his eyes, his mind grew weary, and,\nsleep coming upon him, he soon fell into a doze wherein, his recent\nsensations blending with memories, he became conscious of a double\nself, at once student and married man, lying in his bed as but now, and\ncrossing the operation theatre as of old. The warm smell of poultices\nmingled in his brain with the fresh odour of dew; he heard the iron\nrings rattling along the curtain-rods of the bed and saw his wife\nsleeping. As he passed Vassonville he came upon a boy sitting on the\ngrass at the edge of a ditch.\n\n\"Are you the doctor?\" asked the child.\n\nAnd on Charles's answer he took his wooden shoes in his hands and ran on\nin front of him.\n\nThe general practitioner, riding along, gathered from his guide's talk\nthat Monsieur Rouault must be one of the well-to-do farmers.\n\nHe had broken his leg the evening before on his way home from a\nTwelfth-night feast at a neighbour's. His wife had been dead for two\nyears. There was with him only his daughter, who helped him to keep\nhouse.\n\nThe ruts were becoming deeper; they were approaching the Bertaux.\n\nThe little lad, slipping through a hole in the hedge, disappeared;\nthen he came back to the end of a courtyard to open the gate. The\nhorse slipped on the wet grass; Charles had to stoop to pass under\nthe branches. The watchdogs in their kennels barked, dragging at their\nchains. As he entered the Bertaux, the horse took fright and stumbled.\n\nIt was a substantial-looking farm. In the stables, over the top of the\nopen doors, one could see great cart-horses quietly feeding from new\nracks. Right along the outbuildings extended a large dunghill, from\nwhich manure liquid oozed, while amidst fowls and turkeys, five or six\npeacocks, a luxury in Chauchois farmyards, were foraging on the top of\nit. The sheepfold was long, the barn high, with walls smooth as your\nhand. Under the cart-shed were two large carts and four ploughs, with\ntheir whips, shafts and harnesses complete, whose fleeces of blue wool\nwere getting soiled by the fine dust that fell from the granaries. The\ncourtyard sloped upwards, planted with trees set out symmetrically, and\nthe chattering noise of a flock of geese was heard near the pond.\n\nA young woman in a blue merino dress with three flounces came to the\nthreshold of the door to receive Monsieur Bovary, whom she led to the\nkitchen, where a large fire was blazing. The servant's breakfast was\nboiling beside it in small pots of all sizes. Some damp clothes were\ndrying inside the chimney-corner. The shovel, tongs, and the nozzle\nof the bellows, all of colossal size, shone like polished steel, while\nalong the walls hung many pots and pans in which the clear flame of the\nhearth, mingling with the first rays of the sun coming in through the\nwindow, was mirrored fitfully.\n\nCharles went up the first floor to see the patient. He found him in his\nbed, sweating under his bed-clothes, having thrown his cotton nightcap\nright away from him. He was a fat little man of fifty, with white skin\nand blue eyes, the forepart of his head bald, and he wore earrings. By\nhis side on a chair stood a large decanter of brandy, whence he poured\nhimself a little from time to time to keep up his spirits; but as soon\nas he caught sight of the doctor his elation subsided, and instead of\nswearing, as he had been doing for the last twelve hours, began to groan\nfreely.\n\nThe fracture was a simple one, without any kind of complication.\n\nCharles could not have hoped for an easier case. Then calling to mind\nthe devices of his masters at the bedsides of patients, he comforted the\nsufferer with all sorts of kindly remarks, those caresses of the surgeon\nthat are like the oil they put on bistouries. In order to make some\nsplints a bundle of laths was brought up from the cart-house. Charles\nselected one, cut it into two pieces and planed it with a fragment\nof windowpane, while the servant tore up sheets to make bandages, and\nMademoiselle Emma tried to sew some pads. As she was a long time before\nshe found her work-case, her father grew impatient; she did not answer,\nbut as she sewed she pricked her fingers, which she then put to her\nmouth to suck them. Charles was surprised at the whiteness of her nails.\nThey were shiny, delicate at the tips, more polished than the ivory of\nDieppe, and almond-shaped. Yet her hand was not beautiful, perhaps not\nwhite enough, and a little hard at the knuckles; besides, it was too\nlong, with no soft inflections in the outlines. Her real beauty was in\nher eyes. Although brown, they seemed black because of the lashes, and\nher look came at you frankly, with a candid boldness.\n\nThe bandaging over, the doctor was invited by Monsieur Rouault himself\nto \"pick a bit\" before he left.\n\nCharles went down into the room on the ground floor. Knives and forks\nand silver goblets were laid for two on a little table at the foot of a\nhuge bed that had a canopy of printed cotton with figures representing\nTurks. There was an odour of iris-root and damp sheets that escaped\nfrom a large oak chest opposite the window. On the floor in corners were\nsacks of flour stuck upright in rows. These were the overflow from\nthe neighbouring granary, to which three stone steps led. By way of\ndecoration for the apartment, hanging to a nail in the middle of the\nwall, whose green paint scaled off from the effects of the saltpetre,\nwas a crayon head of Minerva in gold frame, underneath which was written\nin Gothic letters \"To dear Papa.\"\n\nFirst they spoke of the patient, then of the weather, of the great cold,\nof the wolves that infested the fields at night.\n\nMademoiselle Rouault did not at all like the country, especially now\nthat she had to look after the farm almost alone. As the room was\nchilly, she shivered as she ate. This showed something of her full lips,\nthat she had a habit of biting when silent.\n\nHer neck stood out from a white turned-down collar. Her hair, whose\ntwo black folds seemed each of a single piece, so smooth were they, was\nparted in the middle by a delicate line that curved slightly with the\ncurve of the head; and, just showing the tip of the ear, it was joined\nbehind in a thick chignon, with a wavy movement at the temples that the\ncountry doctor saw now for the first time in his life. The upper part of\nher cheek was rose-coloured. She had, like a man, thrust in between two\nbuttons of her bodice a tortoise-shell eyeglass.\n\nWhen Charles, after bidding farewell to old Rouault, returned to the\nroom before leaving, he found her standing, her forehead against the\nwindow, looking into the garden, where the bean props had been knocked\ndown by the wind. She turned round. \"Are you looking for anything?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"My whip, if you please,\" he answered.\n\nHe began rummaging on the bed, behind the doors, under the chairs. It\nhad fallen to the floor, between the sacks and the wall. Mademoiselle\nEmma saw it, and bent over the flour sacks.\n\nCharles out of politeness made a dash also, and as he stretched out his\narm, at the same moment felt his breast brush against the back of the\nyoung girl bending beneath him. She drew herself up, scarlet, and looked\nat him over her shoulder as she handed him his whip.\n\nInstead of returning to the Bertaux in three days as he had promised,\nhe went back the very next day, then regularly twice a week, without\ncounting the visits he paid now and then as if by accident.\n\nEverything, moreover, went well; the patient progressed favourably; and\nwhen, at the end of forty-six days, old Rouault was seen trying to walk\nalone in his \"den,\" Monsieur Bovary began to be looked upon as a man\nof great capacity. Old Rouault said that he could not have been cured\nbetter by the first doctor of Yvetot, or even of Rouen.\n\nAs to Charles, he did not stop to ask himself why it was a pleasure\nto him to go to the Bertaux. Had he done so, he would, no doubt, have\nattributed his zeal to the importance of the case, or perhaps to the\nmoney he hoped to make by it. Was it for this, however, that his visits\nto the farm formed a delightful exception to the meagre occupations of\nhis life? On these days he rose early, set off at a gallop, urging on\nhis horse, then got down to wipe his boots in the grass and put on black\ngloves before entering. He liked going into the courtyard, and noticing\nthe gate turn against his shoulder, the cock crow on the wall, the lads\nrun to meet him. He liked the granary and the stables; he liked old\nRouault, who pressed his hand and called him his saviour; he liked the\nsmall wooden shoes of Mademoiselle Emma on the scoured flags of the\nkitchen--her high heels made her a little taller; and when she walked in\nfront of him, the wooden soles springing up quickly struck with a sharp\nsound against the leather of her boots.\n\nShe always accompanied him to the first step of the stairs. When his\nhorse had not yet been brought round she stayed there. They had said\n\"Good-bye\"; there was no more talking. The open air wrapped her round,\nplaying with the soft down on the back of her neck, or blew to and fro\non her hips the apron-strings, that fluttered like streamers. Once,\nduring a thaw the bark of the trees in the yard was oozing, the snow on\nthe roofs of the outbuildings was melting; she stood on the threshold,\nand went to fetch her sunshade and opened it. The sunshade of silk of\nthe colour of pigeons' breasts, through which the sun shone, lighted\nup with shifting hues the white skin of her face. She smiled under the\ntender warmth, and drops of water could be heard falling one by one on\nthe stretched silk.\n\nDuring the first period of Charles's visits to the Bertaux, Madame\nBovary junior never failed to inquire after the invalid, and she had\neven chosen in the book that she kept on a system of double entry a\nclean blank page for Monsieur Rouault. But when she heard he had a\ndaughter, she began to make inquiries, and she learnt the Mademoiselle\nRouault, brought up at the Ursuline Convent, had received what is called\n\"a good education\"; and so knew dancing, geography, drawing, how to\nembroider and play the piano. That was the last straw.\n\n\"So it is for this,\" she said to herself, \"that his face beams when he\ngoes to see her, and that he puts on his new waistcoat at the risk of\nspoiling it with the rain. Ah! that woman! That woman!\"\n\nAnd she detested her instinctively. At first she solaced herself by\nallusions that Charles did not understand, then by casual observations\nthat he let pass for fear of a storm, finally by open apostrophes to\nwhich he knew not what to answer. \"Why did he go back to the Bertaux now\nthat Monsieur Rouault was cured and that these folks hadn't paid yet?\nAh! it was because a young lady was there, some one who know how to\ntalk, to embroider, to be witty. That was what he cared about; he wanted\ntown misses.\" And she went on--\n\n\"The daughter of old Rouault a town miss! Get out! Their grandfather was\na shepherd, and they have a cousin who was almost had up at the assizes\nfor a nasty blow in a quarrel. It is not worth while making such a fuss,\nor showing herself at church on Sundays in a silk gown like a countess.\nBesides, the poor old chap, if it hadn't been for the colza last year,\nwould have had much ado to pay up his arrears.\"\n\nFor very weariness Charles left off going to the Bertaux. Heloise made\nhim swear, his hand on the prayer-book, that he would go there no more\nafter much sobbing and many kisses, in a great outburst of love. He\nobeyed then, but the strength of his desire protested against the\nservility of his conduct; and he thought, with a kind of naive\nhypocrisy, that his interdict to see her gave him a sort of right to\nlove her. And then the widow was thin; she had long teeth; wore in all\nweathers a little black shawl, the edge of which hung down between her\nshoulder-blades; her bony figure was sheathed in her clothes as if they\nwere a scabbard; they were too short, and displayed her ankles with the\nlaces of her large boots crossed over grey stockings.\n\nCharles's mother came to see them from time to time, but after a few\ndays the daughter-in-law seemed to put her own edge on her, and\nthen, like two knives, they scarified him with their reflections and\nobservations. It was wrong of him to eat so much.\n\nWhy did he always offer a glass of something to everyone who came?\nWhat obstinacy not to wear flannels! In the spring it came about that a\nnotary at Ingouville, the holder of the widow Dubuc's property, one fine\nday went off, taking with him all the money in his office. Heloise,\nit is true, still possessed, besides a share in a boat valued at six\nthousand francs, her house in the Rue St. Francois; and yet, with all\nthis fortune that had been so trumpeted abroad, nothing, excepting\nperhaps a little furniture and a few clothes, had appeared in the\nhousehold. The matter had to be gone into. The house at Dieppe was found\nto be eaten up with mortgages to its foundations; what she had placed\nwith the notary God only knew, and her share in the boat did not exceed\none thousand crowns. She had lied, the good lady! In his exasperation,\nMonsieur Bovary the elder, smashing a chair on the flags, accused his\nwife of having caused misfortune to the son by harnessing him to such\na harridan, whose harness wasn't worth her hide. They came to Tostes.\nExplanations followed. There were scenes. Heloise in tears, throwing her\narms about her husband, implored him to defend her from his parents.\n\nCharles tried to speak up for her. They grew angry and left the house.\n\nBut \"the blow had struck home.\" A week after, as she was hanging up some\nwashing in her yard, she was seized with a spitting of blood, and\nthe next day, while Charles had his back turned to her drawing the\nwindow-curtain, she said, \"O God!\" gave a sigh and fainted. She was\ndead! What a surprise! When all was over at the cemetery Charles went\nhome. He found no one downstairs; he went up to the first floor to\ntheir room; saw her dress still hanging at the foot of the alcove; then,\nleaning against the writing-table, he stayed until the evening, buried\nin a sorrowful reverie. She had loved him after all!\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n\nOne morning old Rouault brought Charles the money for setting his\nleg--seventy-five francs in forty-sou pieces, and a turkey. He had heard\nof his loss, and consoled him as well as he could.\n\n\"I know what it is,\" said he, clapping him on the shoulder; \"I've been\nthrough it. When I lost my dear departed, I went into the fields to be\nquite alone. I fell at the foot of a tree; I cried; I called on God; I\ntalked nonsense to Him. I wanted to be like the moles that I saw on the\nbranches, their insides swarming with worms, dead, and an end of it.\nAnd when I thought that there were others at that very moment with their\nnice little wives holding them in their embrace, I struck great blows on\nthe earth with my stick. I was pretty well mad with not eating; the very\nidea of going to a cafe disgusted me--you wouldn't believe it. Well,\nquite softly, one day following another, a spring on a winter, and an\nautumn after a summer, this wore away, piece by piece, crumb by crumb;\nit passed away, it is gone, I should say it has sunk; for something\nalways remains at the bottom as one would say--a weight here, at one's\nheart. But since it is the lot of all of us, one must not give way\naltogether, and, because others have died, want to die too. You must\npull yourself together, Monsieur Bovary. It will pass away. Come to see\nus; my daughter thinks of you now and again, d'ye know, and she says\nyou are forgetting her. Spring will soon be here. We'll have some\nrabbit-shooting in the warrens to amuse you a bit.\"\n\nCharles followed his advice. He went back to the Bertaux. He found all\nas he had left it, that is to say, as it was five months ago. The pear\ntrees were already in blossom, and Farmer Rouault, on his legs again,\ncame and went, making the farm more full of life.\n\nThinking it his duty to heap the greatest attention upon the doctor\nbecause of his sad position, he begged him not to take his hat off,\nspoke to him in an undertone as if he had been ill, and even pretended\nto be angry because nothing rather lighter had been prepared for him\nthan for the others, such as a little clotted cream or stewed pears. He\ntold stories. Charles found himself laughing, but the remembrance of his\nwife suddenly coming back to him depressed him. Coffee was brought in;\nhe thought no more about her.\n\nHe thought less of her as he grew accustomed to living alone. The new\ndelight of independence soon made his loneliness bearable. He could now\nchange his meal-times, go in or out without explanation, and when he was\nvery tired stretch himself at full length on his bed. So he nursed and\ncoddled himself and accepted the consolations that were offered him.\nOn the other hand, the death of his wife had not served him ill in his\nbusiness, since for a month people had been saying, \"The poor young\nman! what a loss!\" His name had been talked about, his practice had\nincreased; and moreover, he could go to the Bertaux just as he liked.\nHe had an aimless hope, and was vaguely happy; he thought himself better\nlooking as he brushed his whiskers before the looking-glass.\n\nOne day he got there about three o'clock. Everybody was in the fields.\nHe went into the kitchen, but did not at once catch sight of Emma; the\noutside shutters were closed. Through the chinks of the wood the sun\nsent across the flooring long fine rays that were broken at the corners\nof the furniture and trembled along the ceiling. Some flies on the table\nwere crawling up the glasses that had been used, and buzzing as they\ndrowned themselves in the dregs of the cider. The daylight that came in\nby the chimney made velvet of the soot at the back of the fireplace, and\ntouched with blue the cold cinders. Between the window and the hearth\nEmma was sewing; she wore no fichu; he could see small drops of\nperspiration on her bare shoulders.\n\nAfter the fashion of country folks she asked him to have something to\ndrink. He said no; she insisted, and at last laughingly offered to have\na glass of liqueur with him. So she went to fetch a bottle of curacao\nfrom the cupboard, reached down two small glasses, filled one to the\nbrim, poured scarcely anything into the other, and, after having clinked\nglasses, carried hers to her mouth. As it was almost empty she bent\nback to drink, her head thrown back, her lips pouting, her neck on the\nstrain. She laughed at getting none of it, while with the tip of her\ntongue passing between her small teeth she licked drop by drop the\nbottom of her glass.\n\nShe sat down again and took up her work, a white cotton stocking she was\ndarning. She worked with her head bent down; she did not speak, nor did\nCharles. The air coming in under the door blew a little dust over the\nflags; he watched it drift along, and heard nothing but the throbbing\nin his head and the faint clucking of a hen that had laid an egg in the\nyard. Emma from time to time cooled her cheeks with the palms of her\nhands, and cooled these again on the knobs of the huge fire-dogs.\n\nShe complained of suffering since the beginning of the season from\ngiddiness; she asked if sea-baths would do her any good; she began\ntalking of her convent, Charles of his school; words came to them. They\nwent up into her bedroom. She showed him her old music-books, the little\nprizes she had won, and the oak-leaf crowns, left at the bottom of a\ncupboard. She spoke to him, too, of her mother, of the country, and even\nshowed him the bed in the garden where, on the first Friday of every\nmonth, she gathered flowers to put on her mother's tomb. But the\ngardener they had never knew anything about it; servants are so stupid!\nShe would have dearly liked, if only for the winter, to live in town,\nalthough the length of the fine days made the country perhaps even more\nwearisome in the summer. And, according to what she was saying, her\nvoice was clear, sharp, or, on a sudden all languor, drawn out in\nmodulations that ended almost in murmurs as she spoke to herself, now\njoyous, opening big naive eyes, then with her eyelids half closed, her\nlook full of boredom, her thoughts wandering.\n\nGoing home at night, Charles went over her words one by one, trying to\nrecall them, to fill out their sense, that he might piece out the life\nshe had lived before he knew her. But he never saw her in his thoughts\nother than he had seen her the first time, or as he had just left her.\nThen he asked himself what would become of her--if she would be married,\nand to whom! Alas! Old Rouault was rich, and she!--so beautiful! But\nEmma's face always rose before his eyes, and a monotone, like the\nhumming of a top, sounded in his ears, \"If you should marry after\nall! If you should marry!\" At night he could not sleep; his throat was\nparched; he was athirst. He got up to drink from the water-bottle and\nopened the window. The night was covered with stars, a warm wind blowing\nin the distance; the dogs were barking. He turned his head towards the\nBertaux.\n\nThinking that, after all, he should lose nothing, Charles promised\nhimself to ask her in marriage as soon as occasion offered, but each\ntime such occasion did offer the fear of not finding the right words\nsealed his lips.\n\nOld Rouault would not have been sorry to be rid of his daughter, who was\nof no use to him in the house. In his heart he excused her, thinking\nher too clever for farming, a calling under the ban of Heaven, since one\nnever saw a millionaire in it. Far from having made a fortune by it,\nthe good man was losing every year; for if he was good in bargaining, in\nwhich he enjoyed the dodges of the trade, on the other hand, agriculture\nproperly so called, and the internal management of the farm, suited him\nless than most people. He did not willingly take his hands out of his\npockets, and did not spare expense in all that concerned himself, liking\nto eat well, to have good fires, and to sleep well. He liked old cider,\nunderdone legs of mutton, glorias* well beaten up. He took his meals in\nthe kitchen alone, opposite the fire, on a little table brought to him\nall ready laid as on the stage.\n\n     *A mixture of coffee and spirits.\n\nWhen, therefore, he perceived that Charles's cheeks grew red if near his\ndaughter, which meant that he would propose for her one of these days,\nhe chewed the cud of the matter beforehand. He certainly thought him a\nlittle meagre, and not quite the son-in-law he would have liked, but he\nwas said to be well brought-up, economical, very learned, and no doubt\nwould not make too many difficulties about the dowry. Now, as old\nRouault would soon be forced to sell twenty-two acres of \"his property,\"\nas he owed a good deal to the mason, to the harness-maker, and as the\nshaft of the cider-press wanted renewing, \"If he asks for her,\" he said\nto himself, \"I'll give her to him.\"\n\nAt Michaelmas Charles went to spend three days at the Bertaux.\n\nThe last had passed like the others in procrastinating from hour to\nhour. Old Rouault was seeing him off; they were walking along the road\nfull of ruts; they were about to part. This was the time. Charles gave\nhimself as far as to the corner of the hedge, and at last, when past\nit--\n\n\"Monsieur Rouault,\" he murmured, \"I should like to say something to\nyou.\"\n\nThey stopped. Charles was silent.\n\n\"Well, tell me your story. Don't I know all about it?\" said old Rouault,\nlaughing softly.\n\n\"Monsieur Rouault--Monsieur Rouault,\" stammered Charles.\n\n\"I ask nothing better\", the farmer went on. \"Although, no doubt, the\nlittle one is of my mind, still we must ask her opinion. So you get\noff--I'll go back home. If it is 'yes', you needn't return because of\nall the people about, and besides it would upset her too much. But so\nthat you mayn't be eating your heart, I'll open wide the outer shutter\nof the window against the wall; you can see it from the back by leaning\nover the hedge.\"\n\nAnd he went off.\n\nCharles fastened his horse to a tree; he ran into the road and waited.\nHalf an hour passed, then he counted nineteen minutes by his watch.\nSuddenly a noise was heard against the wall; the shutter had been thrown\nback; the hook was still swinging.\n\nThe next day by nine o'clock he was at the farm. Emma blushed as\nhe entered, and she gave a little forced laugh to keep herself in\ncountenance. Old Rouault embraced his future son-in-law. The discussion\nof money matters was put off; moreover, there was plenty of time before\nthem, as the marriage could not decently take place till Charles was out\nof mourning, that is to say, about the spring of the next year.\n\nThe winter passed waiting for this. Mademoiselle Rouault was busy with\nher trousseau. Part of it was ordered at Rouen, and she made herself\nchemises and nightcaps after fashion-plates that she borrowed. When\nCharles visited the farmer, the preparations for the wedding were talked\nover; they wondered in what room they should have dinner; they dreamed\nof the number of dishes that would be wanted, and what should be\nentrees.\n\nEmma would, on the contrary, have preferred to have a midnight wedding\nwith torches, but old Rouault could not understand such an idea. So\nthere was a wedding at which forty-three persons were present, at which\nthey remained sixteen hours at table, began again the next day, and to\nsome extent on the days following.\n\n\n\nChapter Four\n\nThe guests arrived early in carriages, in one-horse chaises, two-wheeled\ncars, old open gigs, waggonettes with leather hoods, and the young\npeople from the nearer villages in carts, in which they stood up in\nrows, holding on to the sides so as not to fall, going at a trot\nand well shaken up. Some came from a distance of thirty miles, from\nGoderville, from Normanville, and from Cany.\n\nAll the relatives of both families had been invited, quarrels between\nfriends arranged, acquaintances long since lost sight of written to.\n\nFrom time to time one heard the crack of a whip behind the hedge; then\nthe gates opened, a chaise entered. Galloping up to the foot of the\nsteps, it stopped short and emptied its load. They got down from all\nsides, rubbing knees and stretching arms. The ladies, wearing bonnets,\nhad on dresses in the town fashion, gold watch chains, pelerines with\nthe ends tucked into belts, or little coloured fichus fastened down\nbehind with a pin, and that left the back of the neck bare. The lads,\ndressed like their papas, seemed uncomfortable in their new clothes\n(many that day hand-sewed their first pair of boots), and by their\nsides, speaking never a work, wearing the white dress of their first\ncommunion lengthened for the occasion were some big girls of fourteen or\nsixteen, cousins or elder sisters no doubt, rubicund, bewildered, their\nhair greasy with rose pomade, and very much afraid of dirtying their\ngloves. As there were not enough stable-boys to unharness all the\ncarriages, the gentlemen turned up their sleeves and set about it\nthemselves. According to their different social positions they wore\ntail-coats, overcoats, shooting jackets, cutaway-coats; fine tail-coats,\nredolent of family respectability, that only came out of the wardrobe\non state occasions; overcoats with long tails flapping in the wind and\nround capes and pockets like sacks; shooting jackets of coarse\ncloth, generally worn with a cap with a brass-bound peak; very short\ncutaway-coats with two small buttons in the back, close together like\na pair of eyes, and the tails of which seemed cut out of one piece by a\ncarpenter's hatchet. Some, too (but these, you may be sure, would sit at\nthe bottom of the table), wore their best blouses--that is to say,\nwith collars turned down to the shoulders, the back gathered into small\nplaits and the waist fastened very low down with a worked belt.\n\nAnd the shirts stood out from the chests like cuirasses! Everyone had\njust had his hair cut; ears stood out from the heads; they had been\nclose-shaved; a few, even, who had had to get up before daybreak, and\nnot been able to see to shave, had diagonal gashes under their noses or\ncuts the size of a three-franc piece along the jaws, which the fresh\nair en route had enflamed, so that the great white beaming faces were\nmottled here and there with red dabs.\n\nThe mairie was a mile and a half from the farm, and they went thither\non foot, returning in the same way after the ceremony in the church.\nThe procession, first united like one long coloured scarf that undulated\nacross the fields, along the narrow path winding amid the green corn,\nsoon lengthened out, and broke up into different groups that loitered to\ntalk. The fiddler walked in front with his violin, gay with ribbons at\nits pegs. Then came the married pair, the relations, the friends, all\nfollowing pell-mell; the children stayed behind amusing themselves\nplucking the bell-flowers from oat-ears, or playing amongst themselves\nunseen. Emma's dress, too long, trailed a little on the ground; from\ntime to time she stopped to pull it up, and then delicately, with her\ngloved hands, she picked off the coarse grass and the thistledowns,\nwhile Charles, empty handed, waited till she had finished. Old Rouault,\nwith a new silk hat and the cuffs of his black coat covering his hands\nup to the nails, gave his arm to Madame Bovary senior. As to Monsieur\nBovary senior, who, heartily despising all these folk, had come simply\nin a frock-coat of military cut with one row of buttons--he was passing\ncompliments of the bar to a fair young peasant. She bowed, blushed,\nand did not know what to say. The other wedding guests talked of their\nbusiness or played tricks behind each other's backs, egging one another\non in advance to be jolly. Those who listened could always catch the\nsqueaking of the fiddler, who went on playing across the fields. When\nhe saw that the rest were far behind he stopped to take breath, slowly\nrosined his bow, so that the strings should sound more shrilly, then set\noff again, by turns lowering and raising his neck, the better to mark\ntime for himself. The noise of the instrument drove away the little\nbirds from afar.\n\nThe table was laid under the cart-shed. On it were four sirloins, six\nchicken fricassees, stewed veal, three legs of mutton, and in the middle\na fine roast suckling pig, flanked by four chitterlings with sorrel. At\nthe corners were decanters of brandy. Sweet bottled-cider frothed round\nthe corks, and all the glasses had been filled to the brim with wine\nbeforehand. Large dishes of yellow cream, that trembled with the least\nshake of the table, had designed on their smooth surface the initials of\nthe newly wedded pair in nonpareil arabesques. A confectioner of Yvetot\nhad been intrusted with the tarts and sweets. As he had only just set up\non the place, he had taken a lot of trouble, and at dessert he himself\nbrought in a set dish that evoked loud cries of wonderment. To begin\nwith, at its base there was a square of blue cardboard, representing a\ntemple with porticoes, colonnades, and stucco statuettes all round, and\nin the niches constellations of gilt paper stars; then on the second\nstage was a dungeon of Savoy cake, surrounded by many fortifications\nin candied angelica, almonds, raisins, and quarters of oranges; and\nfinally, on the upper platform a green field with rocks set in lakes of\njam, nutshell boats, and a small Cupid balancing himself in a chocolate\nswing whose two uprights ended in real roses for balls at the top.\n\nUntil night they ate. When any of them were too tired of sitting, they\nwent out for a stroll in the yard, or for a game with corks in the\ngranary, and then returned to table. Some towards the finish went to\nsleep and snored. But with the coffee everyone woke up. Then they began\nsongs, showed off tricks, raised heavy weights, performed feats with\ntheir fingers, then tried lifting carts on their shoulders, made broad\njokes, kissed the women. At night when they left, the horses, stuffed\nup to the nostrils with oats, could hardly be got into the shafts; they\nkicked, reared, the harness broke, their masters laughed or swore;\nand all night in the light of the moon along country roads there were\nrunaway carts at full gallop plunging into the ditches, jumping over\nyard after yard of stones, clambering up the hills, with women leaning\nout from the tilt to catch hold of the reins.\n\nThose who stayed at the Bertaux spent the night drinking in the kitchen.\nThe children had fallen asleep under the seats.\n\nThe bride had begged her father to be spared the usual marriage\npleasantries. However, a fishmonger, one of their cousins (who had even\nbrought a pair of soles for his wedding present), began to squirt water\nfrom his mouth through the keyhole, when old Rouault came up just in\ntime to stop him, and explain to him that the distinguished position\nof his son-in-law would not allow of such liberties. The cousin all the\nsame did not give in to these reasons readily. In his heart he accused\nold Rouault of being proud, and he joined four or five other guests in\na corner, who having, through mere chance, been several times running\nserved with the worst helps of meat, also were of opinion they had been\nbadly used, and were whispering about their host, and with covered hints\nhoping he would ruin himself.\n\nMadame Bovary, senior, had not opened her mouth all day. She had been\nconsulted neither as to the dress of her daughter-in-law nor as to the\narrangement of the feast; she went to bed early. Her husband, instead\nof following her, sent to Saint-Victor for some cigars, and smoked till\ndaybreak, drinking kirsch-punch, a mixture unknown to the company. This\nadded greatly to the consideration in which he was held.\n\nCharles, who was not of a facetious turn, did not shine at the wedding.\nHe answered feebly to the puns, doubles entendres*, compliments, and\nchaff that it was felt a duty to let off at him as soon as the soup\nappeared.\n\n     *Double meanings.\n\nThe next day, on the other hand, he seemed another man. It was he who\nmight rather have been taken for the virgin of the evening before,\nwhilst the bride gave no sign that revealed anything. The shrewdest did\nnot know what to make of it, and they looked at her when she passed\nnear them with an unbounded concentration of mind. But Charles concealed\nnothing. He called her \"my wife\", tutoyed* her, asked for her of\neveryone, looked for her everywhere, and often he dragged her into the\nyards, where he could be seen from far between the trees, putting his\narm around her waist, and walking half-bending over her, ruffling the\nchemisette of her bodice with his head.\n\n     *Used the familiar form of address.\n\nTwo days after the wedding the married pair left. Charles, on account of\nhis patients, could not be away longer. Old Rouault had them driven back\nin his cart, and himself accompanied them as far as Vassonville. Here\nhe embraced his daughter for the last time, got down, and went his way.\nWhen he had gone about a hundred paces he stopped, and as he saw the\ncart disappearing, its wheels turning in the dust, he gave a deep sigh.\nThen he remembered his wedding, the old times, the first pregnancy of\nhis wife; he, too, had been very happy the day when he had taken her\nfrom her father to his home, and had carried her off on a pillion,\ntrotting through the snow, for it was near Christmas-time, and the\ncountry was all white. She held him by one arm, her basket hanging from\nthe other; the wind blew the long lace of her Cauchois headdress so that\nit sometimes flapped across his mouth, and when he turned his head he\nsaw near him, on his shoulder, her little rosy face, smiling silently\nunder the gold bands of her cap. To warm her hands she put them from\ntime to time in his breast. How long ago it all was! Their son would\nhave been thirty by now. Then he looked back and saw nothing on the\nroad. He felt dreary as an empty house; and tender memories mingling\nwith the sad thoughts in his brain, addled by the fumes of the feast, he\nfelt inclined for a moment to take a turn towards the church. As he was\nafraid, however, that this sight would make him yet more sad, he went\nright away home.\n\nMonsieur and Madame Charles arrived at Tostes about six o'clock.\n\nThe neighbors came to the windows to see their doctor's new wife.\n\nThe old servant presented herself, curtsied to her, apologised for not\nhaving dinner ready, and suggested that madame, in the meantime, should\nlook over her house.\n\n\n\nChapter Five\n\nThe brick front was just in a line with the street, or rather the road.\nBehind the door hung a cloak with a small collar, a bridle, and a black\nleather cap, and on the floor, in a corner, were a pair of leggings,\nstill covered with dry mud. On the right was the one apartment, that was\nboth dining and sitting room. A canary yellow paper, relieved at the\ntop by a garland of pale flowers, was puckered everywhere over the badly\nstretched canvas; white calico curtains with a red border hung crossways\nat the length of the window; and on the narrow mantelpiece a clock with\na head of Hippocrates shone resplendent between two plate candlesticks\nunder oval shades. On the other side of the passage was Charles's\nconsulting room, a little room about six paces wide, with a table,\nthree chairs, and an office chair. Volumes of the \"Dictionary of Medical\nScience,\" uncut, but the binding rather the worse for the successive\nsales through which they had gone, occupied almost along the six shelves\nof a deal bookcase.\n\nThe smell of melted butter penetrated through the walls when he saw\npatients, just as in the kitchen one could hear the people coughing in\nthe consulting room and recounting their histories.\n\nThen, opening on the yard, where the stable was, came a large\ndilapidated room with a stove, now used as a wood-house, cellar, and\npantry, full of old rubbish, of empty casks, agricultural implements\npast service, and a mass of dusty things whose use it was impossible to\nguess.\n\nThe garden, longer than wide, ran between two mud walls with espaliered\napricots, to a hawthorn hedge that separated it from the field. In the\nmiddle was a slate sundial on a brick pedestal; four flower beds with\neglantines surrounded symmetrically the more useful kitchen garden bed.\nRight at the bottom, under the spruce bushes, was a cure in plaster\nreading his breviary.\n\nEmma went upstairs. The first room was not furnished, but in the second,\nwhich was their bedroom, was a mahogany bedstead in an alcove with red\ndrapery. A shell box adorned the chest of drawers, and on the secretary\nnear the window a bouquet of orange blossoms tied with white satin\nribbons stood in a bottle. It was a bride's bouquet; it was the other\none's. She looked at it. Charles noticed it; he took it and carried it\nup to the attic, while Emma seated in an arm-chair (they were putting\nher things down around her) thought of her bridal flowers packed up in\na bandbox, and wondered, dreaming, what would be done with them if she\nwere to die.\n\nDuring the first days she occupied herself in thinking about changes in\nthe house. She took the shades off the candlesticks, had new wallpaper\nput up, the staircase repainted, and seats made in the garden round the\nsundial; she even inquired how she could get a basin with a jet fountain\nand fishes. Finally her husband, knowing that she liked to drive out,\npicked up a second-hand dogcart, which, with new lamps and splashboard\nin striped leather, looked almost like a tilbury.\n\nHe was happy then, and without a care in the world. A meal together,\na walk in the evening on the highroad, a gesture of her hands over her\nhair, the sight of her straw hat hanging from the window-fastener, and\nmany another thing in which Charles had never dreamed of pleasure, now\nmade up the endless round of his happiness. In bed, in the morning, by\nher side, on the pillow, he watched the sunlight sinking into the down\non her fair cheek, half hidden by the lappets of her night-cap. Seen\nthus closely, her eyes looked to him enlarged, especially when, on\nwaking up, she opened and shut them rapidly many times. Black in the\nshade, dark blue in broad daylight, they had, as it were, depths of\ndifferent colours, that, darker in the centre, grew paler towards the\nsurface of the eye. His own eyes lost themselves in these depths; he saw\nhimself in miniature down to the shoulders, with his handkerchief round\nhis head and the top of his shirt open. He rose. She came to the window\nto see him off, and stayed leaning on the sill between two pots of\ngeranium, clad in her dressing gown hanging loosely about her. Charles,\nin the street buckled his spurs, his foot on the mounting stone, while\nshe talked to him from above, picking with her mouth some scrap of\nflower or leaf that she blew out at him. Then this, eddying, floating,\ndescribed semicircles in the air like a bird, and was caught before\nit reached the ground in the ill-groomed mane of the old white mare\nstanding motionless at the door. Charles from horseback threw her a\nkiss; she answered with a nod; she shut the window, and he set off. And\nthen along the highroad, spreading out its long ribbon of dust, along\nthe deep lanes that the trees bent over as in arbours, along paths where\nthe corn reached to the knees, with the sun on his back and the morning\nair in his nostrils, his heart full of the joys of the past night, his\nmind at rest, his flesh at ease, he went on, re-chewing his happiness,\nlike those who after dinner taste again the truffles which they are\ndigesting.\n\nUntil now what good had he had of his life? His time at school, when\nhe remained shut up within the high walls, alone, in the midst of\ncompanions richer than he or cleverer at their work, who laughed at his\naccent, who jeered at his clothes, and whose mothers came to the school\nwith cakes in their muffs? Later on, when he studied medicine, and never\nhad his purse full enough to treat some little work-girl who would have\nbecome his mistress? Afterwards, he had lived fourteen months with the\nwidow, whose feet in bed were cold as icicles. But now he had for life\nthis beautiful woman whom he adored. For him the universe did not extend\nbeyond the circumference of her petticoat, and he reproached himself\nwith not loving her. He wanted to see her again; he turned back quickly,\nran up the stairs with a beating heart. Emma, in her room, was dressing;\nhe came up on tiptoe, kissed her back; she gave a cry.\n\nHe could not keep from constantly touching her comb, her ring, her\nfichu; sometimes he gave her great sounding kisses with all his mouth on\nher cheeks, or else little kisses in a row all along her bare arm\nfrom the tip of her fingers up to her shoulder, and she put him away\nhalf-smiling, half-vexed, as you do a child who hangs about you.\n\nBefore marriage she thought herself in love; but the happiness that\nshould have followed this love not having come, she must, she thought,\nhave been mistaken. And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in\nlife by the words felicity, passion, rapture, that had seemed to her so\nbeautiful in books.\n\n\n\nChapter Six\n\nShe had read \"Paul and Virginia,\" and she had dreamed of the little\nbamboo-house, the nigger Domingo, the dog Fidele, but above all of the\nsweet friendship of some dear little brother, who seeks red fruit for\nyou on trees taller than steeples, or who runs barefoot over the sand,\nbringing you a bird's nest.\n\nWhen she was thirteen, her father himself took her to town to place\nher in the convent. They stopped at an inn in the St. Gervais quarter,\nwhere, at their supper, they used painted plates that set forth the\nstory of Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The explanatory legends, chipped\nhere and there by the scratching of knives, all glorified religion, the\ntendernesses of the heart, and the pomps of court.\n\nFar from being bored at first at the convent, she took pleasure in the\nsociety of the good sisters, who, to amuse her, took her to the chapel,\nwhich one entered from the refectory by a long corridor. She played very\nlittle during recreation hours, knew her catechism well, and it was she\nwho always answered Monsieur le Vicaire's difficult questions. Living\nthus, without ever leaving the warm atmosphere of the classrooms, and\namid these pale-faced women wearing rosaries with brass crosses, she\nwas softly lulled by the mystic languor exhaled in the perfumes of the\naltar, the freshness of the holy water, and the lights of the tapers.\nInstead of attending to mass, she looked at the pious vignettes with\ntheir azure borders in her book, and she loved the sick lamb, the sacred\nheart pierced with sharp arrows, or the poor Jesus sinking beneath the\ncross he carries. She tried, by way of mortification, to eat nothing a\nwhole day. She puzzled her head to find some vow to fulfil.\n\nWhen she went to confession, she invented little sins in order that she\nmight stay there longer, kneeling in the shadow, her hands joined,\nher face against the grating beneath the whispering of the priest.\nThe comparisons of betrothed, husband, celestial lover, and eternal\nmarriage, that recur in sermons, stirred within her soul depths of\nunexpected sweetness.\n\nIn the evening, before prayers, there was some religious reading in\nthe study. On week-nights it was some abstract of sacred history or\nthe Lectures of the Abbe Frayssinous, and on Sundays passages from the\n\"Genie du Christianisme,\" as a recreation. How she listened at first to\nthe sonorous lamentations of its romantic melancholies reechoing\nthrough the world and eternity! If her childhood had been spent in the\nshop-parlour of some business quarter, she might perhaps have opened\nher heart to those lyrical invasions of Nature, which usually come to\nus only through translation in books. But she knew the country too well;\nshe knew the lowing of cattle, the milking, the ploughs.\n\nAccustomed to calm aspects of life, she turned, on the contrary, to\nthose of excitement. She loved the sea only for the sake of its storms,\nand the green fields only when broken up by ruins.\n\nShe wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she rejected\nas useless all that did not contribute to the immediate desires of her\nheart, being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking\nfor emotions, not landscapes.\n\nAt the convent there was an old maid who came for a week each month to\nmend the linen. Patronized by the clergy, because she belonged to an\nancient family of noblemen ruined by the Revolution, she dined in the\nrefectory at the table of the good sisters, and after the meal had a bit\nof chat with them before going back to her work. The girls often slipped\nout from the study to go and see her. She knew by heart the love songs\nof the last century, and sang them in a low voice as she stitched away.\n\nShe told stories, gave them news, went errands in the town, and on\nthe sly lent the big girls some novel, that she always carried in the\npockets of her apron, and of which the good lady herself swallowed\nlong chapters in the intervals of her work. They were all love, lovers,\nsweethearts, persecuted ladies fainting in lonely pavilions, postilions\nkilled at every stage, horses ridden to death on every page, sombre\nforests, heartaches, vows, sobs, tears and kisses, little skiffs by\nmoonlight, nightingales in shady groves, \"gentlemen\" brave as lions,\ngentle as lambs, virtuous as no one ever was, always well dressed, and\nweeping like fountains. For six months, then, Emma, at fifteen years of\nage, made her hands dirty with books from old lending libraries.\n\nThrough Walter Scott, later on, she fell in love with historical events,\ndreamed of old chests, guard-rooms and minstrels. She would have liked\nto live in some old manor-house, like those long-waisted chatelaines\nwho, in the shade of pointed arches, spent their days leaning on the\nstone, chin in hand, watching a cavalier with white plume galloping on\nhis black horse from the distant fields. At this time she had a cult\nfor Mary Stuart and enthusiastic veneration for illustrious or unhappy\nwomen. Joan of Arc, Heloise, Agnes Sorel, the beautiful Ferroniere, and\nClemence Isaure stood out to her like comets in the dark immensity of\nheaven, where also were seen, lost in shadow, and all unconnected, St.\nLouis with his oak, the dying Bayard, some cruelties of Louis XI, a\nlittle of St. Bartholomew's Day, the plume of the Bearnais, and always\nthe remembrance of the plates painted in honour of Louis XIV.\n\nIn the music class, in the ballads she sang, there was nothing but\nlittle angels with golden wings, madonnas, lagunes, gondoliers;-mild\ncompositions that allowed her to catch a glimpse athwart the obscurity\nof style and the weakness of the music of the attractive phantasmagoria\nof sentimental realities. Some of her companions brought \"keepsakes\"\ngiven them as new year's gifts to the convent. These had to be hidden;\nit was quite an undertaking; they were read in the dormitory. Delicately\nhandling the beautiful satin bindings, Emma looked with dazzled eyes at\nthe names of the unknown authors, who had signed their verses for the\nmost part as counts or viscounts.\n\nShe trembled as she blew back the tissue paper over the engraving and\nsaw it folded in two and fall gently against the page. Here behind the\nbalustrade of a balcony was a young man in a short cloak, holding in his\narms a young girl in a white dress wearing an alms-bag at her belt; or\nthere were nameless portraits of English ladies with fair curls, who\nlooked at you from under their round straw hats with their large clear\neyes. Some there were lounging in their carriages, gliding through\nparks, a greyhound bounding along in front of the equipage driven at\na trot by two midget postilions in white breeches. Others, dreaming on\nsofas with an open letter, gazed at the moon through a slightly open\nwindow half draped by a black curtain. The naive ones, a tear on their\ncheeks, were kissing doves through the bars of a Gothic cage, or,\nsmiling, their heads on one side, were plucking the leaves of a\nmarguerite with their taper fingers, that curved at the tips like peaked\nshoes. And you, too, were there, Sultans with long pipes reclining\nbeneath arbours in the arms of Bayaderes; Djiaours, Turkish sabres,\nGreek caps; and you especially, pale landscapes of dithyrambic lands,\nthat often show us at once palm trees and firs, tigers on the right, a\nlion to the left, Tartar minarets on the horizon; the whole framed by\na very neat virgin forest, and with a great perpendicular sunbeam\ntrembling in the water, where, standing out in relief like white\nexcoriations on a steel-grey ground, swans are swimming about.\n\nAnd the shade of the argand lamp fastened to the wall above Emma's head\nlighted up all these pictures of the world, that passed before her one\nby one in the silence of the dormitory, and to the distant noise of some\nbelated carriage rolling over the Boulevards.\n\nWhen her mother died she cried much the first few days. She had a\nfuneral picture made with the hair of the deceased, and, in a letter\nsent to the Bertaux full of sad reflections on life, she asked to be\nburied later on in the same grave. The goodman thought she must be ill,\nand came to see her. Emma was secretly pleased that she had reached at\na first attempt the rare ideal of pale lives, never attained by mediocre\nhearts. She let herself glide along with Lamartine meanderings, listened\nto harps on lakes, to all the songs of dying swans, to the falling of\nthe leaves, the pure virgins ascending to heaven, and the voice of\nthe Eternal discoursing down the valleys. She wearied of it, would not\nconfess it, continued from habit, and at last was surprised to feel\nherself soothed, and with no more sadness at heart than wrinkles on her\nbrow.\n\nThe good nuns, who had been so sure of her vocation, perceived with\ngreat astonishment that Mademoiselle Rouault seemed to be slipping\nfrom them. They had indeed been so lavish to her of prayers, retreats,\nnovenas, and sermons, they had so often preached the respect due to\nsaints and martyrs, and given so much good advice as to the modesty of\nthe body and the salvation of her soul, that she did as tightly reined\nhorses; she pulled up short and the bit slipped from her teeth. This\nnature, positive in the midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the\nchurch for the sake of the flowers, and music for the words of the\nsongs, and literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against\nthe mysteries of faith as it grew irritated by discipline, a thing\nantipathetic to her constitution. When her father took her from school,\nno one was sorry to see her go. The Lady Superior even thought that she\nhad latterly been somewhat irreverent to the community.\n\nEmma, at home once more, first took pleasure in looking after the\nservants, then grew disgusted with the country and missed her convent.\nWhen Charles came to the Bertaux for the first time, she thought herself\nquite disillusioned, with nothing more to learn, and nothing more to\nfeel.\n\nBut the uneasiness of her new position, or perhaps the disturbance\ncaused by the presence of this man, had sufficed to make her believe\nthat she at last felt that wondrous passion which, till then, like a\ngreat bird with rose-coloured wings, hung in the splendour of the skies\nof poesy; and now she could not think that the calm in which she lived\nwas the happiness she had dreamed.\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\n\nShe thought, sometimes, that, after all, this was the happiest time\nof her life--the honeymoon, as people called it. To taste the full\nsweetness of it, it would have been necessary doubtless to fly to those\nlands with sonorous names where the days after marriage are full of\nlaziness most suave. In post chaises behind blue silken curtains to ride\nslowly up steep road, listening to the song of the postilion re-echoed\nby the mountains, along with the bells of goats and the muffled sound of\na waterfall; at sunset on the shores of gulfs to breathe in the perfume\nof lemon trees; then in the evening on the villa-terraces above, hand in\nhand to look at the stars, making plans for the future. It seemed to her\nthat certain places on earth must bring happiness, as a plant peculiar\nto the soil, and that cannot thrive elsewhere. Why could not she lean\nover balconies in Swiss chalets, or enshrine her melancholy in a Scotch\ncottage, with a husband dressed in a black velvet coat with long tails,\nand thin shoes, a pointed hat and frills? Perhaps she would have liked\nto confide all these things to someone. But how tell an undefinable\nuneasiness, variable as the clouds, unstable as the winds? Words failed\nher--the opportunity, the courage.\n\nIf Charles had but wished it, if he had guessed it, if his look had but\nonce met her thought, it seemed to her that a sudden plenty would have\ngone out from her heart, as the fruit falls from a tree when shaken by\na hand. But as the intimacy of their life became deeper, the greater\nbecame the gulf that separated her from him.\n\nCharles's conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and\neveryone's ideas trooped through it in their everyday garb, without\nexciting emotion, laughter, or thought. He had never had the curiosity,\nhe said, while he lived at Rouen, to go to the theatre to see the actors\nfrom Paris. He could neither swim, nor fence, nor shoot, and one day\nhe could not explain some term of horsemanship to her that she had come\nacross in a novel.\n\nA man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold\nactivities, initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements\nof life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing,\nwished nothing. He thought her happy; and she resented this easy calm,\nthis serene heaviness, the very happiness she gave him.\n\nSometimes she would draw; and it was great amusement to Charles to stand\nthere bolt upright and watch her bend over her cardboard, with eyes\nhalf-closed the better to see her work, or rolling, between her fingers,\nlittle bread-pellets. As to the piano, the more quickly her fingers\nglided over it the more he wondered. She struck the notes with aplomb,\nand ran from top to bottom of the keyboard without a break. Thus shaken\nup, the old instrument, whose strings buzzed, could be heard at the\nother end of the village when the window was open, and often the\nbailiff's clerk, passing along the highroad bare-headed and in list\nslippers, stopped to listen, his sheet of paper in his hand.\n\nEmma, on the other hand, knew how to look after her house. She sent the\npatients' accounts in well-phrased letters that had no suggestion of\na bill. When they had a neighbour to dinner on Sundays, she managed to\nhave some tasty dish--piled up pyramids of greengages on vine leaves,\nserved up preserves turned out into plates--and even spoke of buying\nfinger-glasses for dessert. From all this much consideration was\nextended to Bovary.\n\nCharles finished by rising in his own esteem for possessing such a wife.\nHe showed with pride in the sitting room two small pencil sketches by\nher that he had had framed in very large frames, and hung up against the\nwallpaper by long green cords. People returning from mass saw him at his\ndoor in his wool-work slippers.\n\nHe came home late--at ten o'clock, at midnight sometimes. Then he asked\nfor something to eat, and as the servant had gone to bed, Emma waited\non him. He took off his coat to dine more at his ease. He told her, one\nafter the other, the people he had met, the villages where he had been,\nthe prescriptions he had written, and, well pleased with himself, he\nfinished the remainder of the boiled beef and onions, picked pieces off\nthe cheese, munched an apple, emptied his water-bottle, and then went to\nbed, and lay on his back and snored.\n\nAs he had been for a time accustomed to wear nightcaps, his handkerchief\nwould not keep down over his ears, so that his hair in the morning was\nall tumbled pell-mell about his face and whitened with the feathers of\nthe pillow, whose strings came untied during the night. He always wore\nthick boots that had two long creases over the instep running obliquely\ntowards the ankle, while the rest of the upper continued in a straight\nline as if stretched on a wooden foot. He said that \"was quite good\nenough for the country.\"\n\nHis mother approved of his economy, for she came to see him as formerly\nwhen there had been some violent row at her place; and yet Madame Bovary\nsenior seemed prejudiced against her daughter-in-law. She thought \"her\nways too fine for their position\"; the wood, the sugar, and the candles\ndisappeared as \"at a grand establishment,\" and the amount of firing in\nthe kitchen would have been enough for twenty-five courses. She put her\nlinen in order for her in the presses, and taught her to keep an eye on\nthe butcher when he brought the meat. Emma put up with these lessons.\nMadame Bovary was lavish of them; and the words \"daughter\" and \"mother\"\nwere exchanged all day long, accompanied by little quiverings of the\nlips, each one uttering gentle words in a voice trembling with anger.\n\nIn Madame Dubuc's time the old woman felt that she was still the\nfavorite; but now the love of Charles for Emma seemed to her a desertion\nfrom her tenderness, an encroachment upon what was hers, and she watched\nher son's happiness in sad silence, as a ruined man looks through\nthe windows at people dining in his old house. She recalled to him as\nremembrances her troubles and her sacrifices, and, comparing these with\nEmma's negligence, came to the conclusion that it was not reasonable to\nadore her so exclusively.\n\nCharles knew not what to answer: he respected his mother, and he loved\nhis wife infinitely; he considered the judgment of the one infallible,\nand yet he thought the conduct of the other irreproachable. When Madam\nBovary had gone, he tried timidly and in the same terms to hazard one or\ntwo of the more anodyne observations he had heard from his mamma. Emma\nproved to him with a word that he was mistaken, and sent him off to his\npatients.\n\nAnd yet, in accord with theories she believed right, she wanted to make\nherself in love with him. By moonlight in the garden she recited all\nthe passionate rhymes she knew by heart, and, sighing, sang to him many\nmelancholy adagios; but she found herself as calm after as before, and\nCharles seemed no more amorous and no more moved.\n\nWhen she had thus for a while struck the flint on her heart without\ngetting a spark, incapable, moreover, of understanding what she did\nnot experience as of believing anything that did not present itself\nin conventional forms, she persuaded herself without difficulty that\nCharles's passion was nothing very exorbitant. His outbursts became\nregular; he embraced her at certain fixed times. It was one habit among\nother habits, and, like a dessert, looked forward to after the monotony\nof dinner.\n\nA gamekeeper, cured by the doctor of inflammation of the lungs, had\ngiven madame a little Italian greyhound; she took her out walking, for\nshe went out sometimes in order to be alone for a moment, and not to see\nbefore her eyes the eternal garden and the dusty road. She went as far\nas the beeches of Banneville, near the deserted pavilion which forms an\nangle of the wall on the side of the country. Amidst the vegetation of\nthe ditch there are long reeds with leaves that cut you.\n\nShe began by looking round her to see if nothing had changed since last\nshe had been there. She found again in the same places the foxgloves and\nwallflowers, the beds of nettles growing round the big stones, and\nthe patches of lichen along the three windows, whose shutters, always\nclosed, were rotting away on their rusty iron bars. Her thoughts,\naimless at first, wandered at random, like her greyhound, who ran round\nand round in the fields, yelping after the yellow butterflies, chasing\nthe shrew-mice, or nibbling the poppies on the edge of a cornfield.\n\nThen gradually her ideas took definite shape, and, sitting on the grass\nthat she dug up with little prods of her sunshade, Emma repeated to\nherself, \"Good heavens! Why did I marry?\"\n\nShe asked herself if by some other chance combination it would have not\nbeen possible to meet another man; and she tried to imagine what would\nhave been these unrealised events, this different life, this unknown\nhusband. All, surely, could not be like this one. He might have been\nhandsome, witty, distinguished, attractive, such as, no doubt, her old\ncompanions of the convent had married. What were they doing now? In\ntown, with the noise of the streets, the buzz of the theatres and the\nlights of the ballroom, they were living lives where the heart expands,\nthe senses bourgeon out. But she--her life was cold as a garret whose\ndormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was\nweaving its web in the darkness in every corner of her heart.\n\nShe recalled the prize days, when she mounted the platform to receive\nher little crowns, with her hair in long plaits. In her white frock and\nopen prunella shoes she had a pretty way, and when she went back to her\nseat, the gentlemen bent over her to congratulate her; the courtyard was\nfull of carriages; farewells were called to her through their windows;\nthe music master with his violin case bowed in passing by. How far all\nof this! How far away! She called Djali, took her between her knees, and\nsmoothed the long delicate head, saying, \"Come, kiss mistress; you have\nno troubles.\"\n\nThen noting the melancholy face of the graceful animal, who yawned\nslowly, she softened, and comparing her to herself, spoke to her aloud\nas to somebody in trouble whom one is consoling.\n\nOccasionally there came gusts of winds, breezes from the sea rolling in\none sweep over the whole plateau of the Caux country, which brought\neven to these fields a salt freshness. The rushes, close to the ground,\nwhistled; the branches trembled in a swift rustling, while their\nsummits, ceaselessly swaying, kept up a deep murmur. Emma drew her shawl\nround her shoulders and rose.\n\nIn the avenue a green light dimmed by the leaves lit up the short moss\nthat crackled softly beneath her feet. The sun was setting; the sky\nshowed red between the branches, and the trunks of the trees, uniform,\nand planted in a straight line, seemed a brown colonnade standing out\nagainst a background of gold. A fear took hold of her; she called Djali,\nand hurriedly returned to Tostes by the high road, threw herself into an\narmchair, and for the rest of the evening did not speak.\n\nBut towards the end of September something extraordinary fell upon her\nlife; she was invited by the Marquis d'Andervilliers to Vaubyessard.\n\nSecretary of State under the Restoration, the Marquis, anxious to\nre-enter political life, set about preparing for his candidature to\nthe Chamber of Deputies long beforehand. In the winter he distributed a\ngreat deal of wood, and in the Conseil General always enthusiastically\ndemanded new roads for his arrondissement. During the dog-days he had\nsuffered from an abscess, which Charles had cured as if by miracle by\ngiving a timely little touch with the lancet. The steward sent to Tostes\nto pay for the operation reported in the evening that he had seen some\nsuperb cherries in the doctor's little garden. Now cherry trees did not\nthrive at Vaubyessard; the Marquis asked Bovary for some slips; made it\nhis business to thank his personally; saw Emma; thought she had a pretty\nfigure, and that she did not bow like a peasant; so that he did not\nthink he was going beyond the bounds of condescension, nor, on the other\nhand, making a mistake, in inviting the young couple.\n\nOn Wednesday at three o'clock, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, seated in\ntheir dog-cart, set out for Vaubyessard, with a great trunk strapped\non behind and a bonnet-box in front of the apron. Besides these Charles\nheld a bandbox between his knees.\n\nThey arrived at nightfall, just as the lamps in the park were being lit\nto show the way for the carriages.\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n\nThe chateau, a modern building in Italian style, with two projecting\nwings and three flights of steps, lay at the foot of an immense\ngreen-sward, on which some cows were grazing among groups of large trees\nset out at regular intervals, while large beds of arbutus, rhododendron,\nsyringas, and guelder roses bulged out their irregular clusters of\ngreen along the curve of the gravel path. A river flowed under a bridge;\nthrough the mist one could distinguish buildings with thatched roofs\nscattered over the field bordered by two gently sloping, well timbered\nhillocks, and in the background amid the trees rose in two parallel\nlines the coach houses and stables, all that was left of the ruined old\nchateau.\n\nCharles's dog-cart pulled up before the middle flight of steps; servants\nappeared; the Marquis came forward, and, offering his arm to the\ndoctor's wife, conducted her to the vestibule.\n\nIt was paved with marble slabs, was very lofty, and the sound of\nfootsteps and that of voices re-echoed through it as in a church.\n\nOpposite rose a straight staircase, and on the left a gallery\noverlooking the garden led to the billiard room, through whose door one\ncould hear the click of the ivory balls. As she crossed it to go to the\ndrawing room, Emma saw standing round the table men with grave faces,\ntheir chins resting on high cravats. They all wore orders, and smiled\nsilently as they made their strokes.\n\nOn the dark wainscoting of the walls large gold frames bore at\nthe bottom names written in black letters. She read: \"Jean-Antoine\nd'Andervilliers d'Yvervonbille, Count de la Vaubyessard and Baron de la\nFresnay, killed at the battle of Coutras on the 20th of October,\n1587.\" And on another: \"Jean-Antoine-Henry-Guy d'Andervilliers de\nla Vaubyessard, Admiral of France and Chevalier of the Order of St.\nMichael, wounded at the battle of the Hougue-Saint-Vaast on the 29th of\nMay, 1692; died at Vaubyessard on the 23rd of January 1693.\" One could\nhardly make out those that followed, for the light of the lamps lowered\nover the green cloth threw a dim shadow round the room. Burnishing the\nhorizontal pictures, it broke up against these in delicate lines where\nthere were cracks in the varnish, and from all these great black squares\nframed in with gold stood out here and there some lighter portion of the\npainting--a pale brow, two eyes that looked at you, perukes flowing over\nand powdering red-coated shoulders, or the buckle of a garter above a\nwell-rounded calf.\n\nThe Marquis opened the drawing room door; one of the ladies (the\nMarchioness herself) came to meet Emma. She made her sit down by her on\nan ottoman, and began talking to her as amicably as if she had known her\na long time. She was a woman of about forty, with fine shoulders, a hook\nnose, a drawling voice, and on this evening she wore over her brown hair\na simple guipure fichu that fell in a point at the back. A fair young\nwoman sat in a high-backed chair in a corner; and gentlemen with flowers\nin their buttonholes were talking to ladies round the fire.\n\nAt seven dinner was served. The men, who were in the majority, sat down\nat the first table in the vestibule; the ladies at the second in the\ndining room with the Marquis and Marchioness.\n\nEmma, on entering, felt herself wrapped round by the warm air, a\nblending of the perfume of flowers and of the fine linen, of the fumes\nof the viands, and the odour of the truffles. The silver dish covers\nreflected the lighted wax candles in the candelabra, the cut crystal\ncovered with light steam reflected from one to the other pale rays;\nbouquets were placed in a row the whole length of the table; and in\nthe large-bordered plates each napkin, arranged after the fashion of a\nbishop's mitre, held between its two gaping folds a small oval shaped\nroll. The red claws of lobsters hung over the dishes; rich fruit in open\nbaskets was piled up on moss; there were quails in their plumage; smoke\nwas rising; and in silk stockings, knee-breeches, white cravat, and\nfrilled shirt, the steward, grave as a judge, offering ready carved\ndishes between the shoulders of the guests, with a touch of the spoon\ngave you the piece chosen. On the large stove of porcelain inlaid\nwith copper baguettes the statue of a woman, draped to the chin, gazed\nmotionless on the room full of life.\n\nMadame Bovary noticed that many ladies had not put their gloves in their\nglasses.\n\nBut at the upper end of the table, alone amongst all these women, bent\nover his full plate, and his napkin tied round his neck like a child, an\nold man sat eating, letting drops of gravy drip from his mouth. His eyes\nwere bloodshot, and he wore a little queue tied with black ribbon. He\nwas the Marquis's father-in-law, the old Duke de Laverdiere, once on\na time favourite of the Count d'Artois, in the days of the Vaudreuil\nhunting-parties at the Marquis de Conflans', and had been, it was said,\nthe lover of Queen Marie Antoinette, between Monsieur de Coigny and\nMonsieur de Lauzun. He had lived a life of noisy debauch, full of duels,\nbets, elopements; he had squandered his fortune and frightened all his\nfamily. A servant behind his chair named aloud to him in his ear the\ndishes that he pointed to stammering, and constantly Emma's eyes\nturned involuntarily to this old man with hanging lips, as to something\nextraordinary. He had lived at court and slept in the bed of queens!\nIced champagne was poured out. Emma shivered all over as she felt\nit cold in her mouth. She had never seen pomegranates nor tasted\npineapples. The powdered sugar even seemed to her whiter and finer than\nelsewhere.\n\nThe ladies afterwards went to their rooms to prepare for the ball.\n\nEmma made her toilet with the fastidious care of an actress on her\ndebut. She did her hair according to the directions of the hairdresser,\nand put on the barege dress spread out upon the bed.\n\nCharles's trousers were tight across the belly.\n\n\"My trouser-straps will be rather awkward for dancing,\" he said.\n\n\"Dancing?\" repeated Emma.\n\n\"Yes!\"\n\n\"Why, you must be mad! They would make fun of you; keep your place.\nBesides, it is more becoming for a doctor,\" she added.\n\nCharles was silent. He walked up and down waiting for Emma to finish\ndressing.\n\nHe saw her from behind in the glass between two lights. Her black eyes\nseemed blacker than ever. Her hair, undulating towards the ears, shone\nwith a blue lustre; a rose in her chignon trembled on its mobile stalk,\nwith artificial dewdrops on the tip of the leaves. She wore a gown of\npale saffron trimmed with three bouquets of pompon roses mixed with\ngreen.\n\nCharles came and kissed her on her shoulder.\n\n\"Let me alone!\" she said; \"you are tumbling me.\"\n\nOne could hear the flourish of the violin and the notes of a horn. She\nwent downstairs restraining herself from running.\n\nDancing had begun. Guests were arriving. There was some crushing.\n\nShe sat down on a form near the door.\n\nThe quadrille over, the floor was occupied by groups of men standing up\nand talking and servants in livery bearing large trays. Along the line\nof seated women painted fans were fluttering, bouquets half hid smiling\nfaces, and gold stoppered scent-bottles were turned in partly-closed\nhands, whose white gloves outlined the nails and tightened on the flesh\nat the wrists. Lace trimmings, diamond brooches, medallion bracelets\ntrembled on bodices, gleamed on breasts, clinked on bare arms.\n\nThe hair, well-smoothed over the temples and knotted at the nape,\nbore crowns, or bunches, or sprays of mytosotis, jasmine, pomegranate\nblossoms, ears of corn, and corn-flowers. Calmly seated in their places,\nmothers with forbidding countenances were wearing red turbans.\n\nEmma's heart beat rather faster when, her partner holding her by the\ntips of the fingers, she took her place in a line with the dancers, and\nwaited for the first note to start. But her emotion soon vanished, and,\nswaying to the rhythm of the orchestra, she glided forward with slight\nmovements of the neck. A smile rose to her lips at certain delicate\nphrases of the violin, that sometimes played alone while the other\ninstruments were silent; one could hear the clear clink of the louis\nd'or that were being thrown down upon the card tables in the next room;\nthen all struck again, the cornet-a-piston uttered its sonorous note,\nfeet marked time, skirts swelled and rustled, hands touched and parted;\nthe same eyes falling before you met yours again.\n\nA few men (some fifteen or so), of twenty-five to forty, scattered here\nand there among the dancers or talking at the doorways, distinguished\nthemselves from the crowd by a certain air of breeding, whatever their\ndifferences in age, dress, or face.\n\nTheir clothes, better made, seemed of finer cloth, and their hair,\nbrought forward in curls towards the temples, glossy with more delicate\npomades. They had the complexion of wealth--that clear complexion that\nis heightened by the pallor of porcelain, the shimmer of satin, the\nveneer of old furniture, and that an ordered regimen of exquisite\nnurture maintains at its best. Their necks moved easily in their low\ncravats, their long whiskers fell over their turned-down collars, they\nwiped their lips upon handkerchiefs with embroidered initials that gave\nforth a subtle perfume. Those who were beginning to grow old had an air\nof youth, while there was something mature in the faces of the young.\nIn their unconcerned looks was the calm of passions daily satiated, and\nthrough all their gentleness of manner pierced that peculiar brutality,\nthe result of a command of half-easy things, in which force is exercised\nand vanity amused--the management of thoroughbred horses and the society\nof loose women.\n\nA few steps from Emma a gentleman in a blue coat was talking of Italy\nwith a pale young woman wearing a parure of pearls.\n\nThey were praising the breadth of the columns of St. Peter's, Tivoly,\nVesuvius, Castellamare, and Cassines, the roses of Genoa, the Coliseum\nby moonlight. With her other ear Emma was listening to a conversation\nfull of words she did not understand. A circle gathered round a very\nyoung man who the week before had beaten \"Miss Arabella\" and \"Romolus,\"\nand won two thousand louis jumping a ditch in England. One complained\nthat his racehorses were growing fat; another of the printers' errors\nthat had disfigured the name of his horse.\n\nThe atmosphere of the ball was heavy; the lamps were growing dim.\n\nGuests were flocking to the billiard room. A servant got upon a chair\nand broke the window-panes. At the crash of the glass Madame Bovary\nturned her head and saw in the garden the faces of peasants pressed\nagainst the window looking in at them. Then the memory of the Bertaux\ncame back to her. She saw the farm again, the muddy pond, her father in\na blouse under the apple trees, and she saw herself again as formerly,\nskimming with her finger the cream off the milk-pans in the dairy. But\nin the refulgence of the present hour her past life, so distinct until\nthen, faded away completely, and she almost doubted having lived it. She\nwas there; beyond the ball was only shadow overspreading all the rest.\nShe was just eating a maraschino ice that she held with her left hand\nin a silver-gilt cup, her eyes half-closed, and the spoon between her\nteeth.\n\nA lady near her dropped her fan. A gentlemen was passing.\n\n\"Would you be so good,\" said the lady, \"as to pick up my fan that has\nfallen behind the sofa?\"\n\nThe gentleman bowed, and as he moved to stretch out his arm, Emma saw\nthe hand of a young woman throw something white, folded in a triangle,\ninto his hat. The gentleman, picking up the fan, offered it to the lady\nrespectfully; she thanked him with an inclination of the head, and began\nsmelling her bouquet.\n\nAfter supper, where were plenty of Spanish and Rhine wines, soups a la\nbisque and au lait d'amandes*, puddings a la Trafalgar, and all sorts of\ncold meats with jellies that trembled in the dishes, the carriages one\nafter the other began to drive off. Raising the corners of the muslin\ncurtain, one could see the light of their lanterns glimmering through\nthe darkness. The seats began to empty, some card-players were still\nleft; the musicians were cooling the tips of their fingers on their\ntongues. Charles was half asleep, his back propped against a door.\n\n     *With almond milk\n\nAt three o'clock the cotillion began. Emma did not know how to waltz.\nEveryone was waltzing, Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers herself and the\nMarquis; only the guests staying at the castle were still there, about a\ndozen persons.\n\nOne of the waltzers, however, who was familiarly called Viscount, and\nwhose low cut waistcoat seemed moulded to his chest, came a second time\nto ask Madame Bovary to dance, assuring her that he would guide her, and\nthat she would get through it very well.\n\nThey began slowly, then went more rapidly. They turned; all around them\nwas turning--the lamps, the furniture, the wainscoting, the floor, like\na disc on a pivot. On passing near the doors the bottom of Emma's dress\ncaught against his trousers.\n\nTheir legs commingled; he looked down at her; she raised her eyes to\nhis. A torpor seized her; she stopped. They started again, and with a\nmore rapid movement; the Viscount, dragging her along disappeared with\nher to the end of the gallery, where panting, she almost fell, and for\na moment rested her head upon his breast. And then, still turning, but\nmore slowly, he guided her back to her seat. She leaned back against the\nwall and covered her eyes with her hands.\n\nWhen she opened them again, in the middle of the drawing room three\nwaltzers were kneeling before a lady sitting on a stool.\n\nShe chose the Viscount, and the violin struck up once more.\n\nEveryone looked at them. They passed and re-passed, she with rigid body,\nher chin bent down, and he always in the same pose, his figure curved,\nhis elbow rounded, his chin thrown forward. That woman knew how to\nwaltz! They kept up a long time, and tired out all the others.\n\nThen they talked a few moments longer, and after the goodnights, or\nrather good mornings, the guests of the chateau retired to bed.\n\nCharles dragged himself up by the balusters. His \"knees were going\nup into his body.\" He had spent five consecutive hours standing\nbolt upright at the card tables, watching them play whist, without\nunderstanding anything about it, and it was with a deep sigh of relief\nthat he pulled off his boots.\n\nEmma threw a shawl over her shoulders, opened the window, and leant out.\n\nThe night was dark; some drops of rain were falling. She breathed in the\ndamp wind that refreshed her eyelids. The music of the ball was still\nmurmuring in her ears. And she tried to keep herself awake in order to\nprolong the illusion of this luxurious life that she would soon have to\ngive up.\n\nDay began to break. She looked long at the windows of the chateau,\ntrying to guess which were the rooms of all those she had noticed the\nevening before. She would fain have known their lives, have penetrated,\nblended with them. But she was shivering with cold. She undressed, and\ncowered down between the sheets against Charles, who was asleep.\n\nThere were a great many people to luncheon. The repast lasted ten\nminutes; no liqueurs were served, which astonished the doctor.\n\nNext, Mademoiselle d'Andervilliers collected some pieces of roll in a\nsmall basket to take them to the swans on the ornamental waters, and\nthey went to walk in the hot-houses, where strange plants, bristling\nwith hairs, rose in pyramids under hanging vases, whence, as from\nover-filled nests of serpents, fell long green cords interlacing.\nThe orangery, which was at the other end, led by a covered way to the\nouthouses of the chateau. The Marquis, to amuse the young woman, took\nher to see the stables.\n\nAbove the basket-shaped racks porcelain slabs bore the names of the\nhorses in black letters. Each animal in its stall whisked its tail when\nanyone went near and said \"Tchk! tchk!\" The boards of the harness room\nshone like the flooring of a drawing room. The carriage harness was\npiled up in the middle against two twisted columns, and the bits, the\nwhips, the spurs, the curbs, were ranged in a line all along the wall.\n\nCharles, meanwhile, went to ask a groom to put his horse to. The\ndog-cart was brought to the foot of the steps, and, all the parcels\nbeing crammed in, the Bovarys paid their respects to the Marquis and\nMarchioness and set out again for Tostes.\n\nEmma watched the turning wheels in silence. Charles, on the extreme edge\nof the seat, held the reins with his two arms wide apart, and the little\nhorse ambled along in the shafts that were too big for him. The loose\nreins hanging over his crupper were wet with foam, and the box fastened\non behind the chaise gave great regular bumps against it.\n\nThey were on the heights of Thibourville when suddenly some horsemen\nwith cigars between their lips passed laughing. Emma thought she\nrecognized the Viscount, turned back, and caught on the horizon only the\nmovement of the heads rising or falling with the unequal cadence of the\ntrot or gallop.\n\nA mile farther on they had to stop to mend with some string the traces\nthat had broken.\n\nBut Charles, giving a last look to the harness, saw something on the\nground between his horse's legs, and he picked up a cigar-case with\na green silk border and beblazoned in the centre like the door of a\ncarriage.\n\n\"There are even two cigars in it,\" said he; \"they'll do for this evening\nafter dinner.\"\n\n\"Why, do you smoke?\" she asked.\n\n\"Sometimes, when I get a chance.\"\n\nHe put his find in his pocket and whipped up the nag.\n\nWhen they reached home the dinner was not ready. Madame lost her temper.\nNastasie answered rudely.\n\n\"Leave the room!\" said Emma. \"You are forgetting yourself. I give you\nwarning.\"\n\nFor dinner there was onion soup and a piece of veal with sorrel.\n\nCharles, seated opposite Emma, rubbed his hands gleefully.\n\n\"How good it is to be at home again!\"\n\nNastasie could be heard crying. He was rather fond of the poor girl.\nShe had formerly, during the wearisome time of his widowhood, kept him\ncompany many an evening. She had been his first patient, his oldest\nacquaintance in the place.\n\n\"Have you given her warning for good?\" he asked at last.\n\n\"Yes. Who is to prevent me?\" she replied.\n\nThen they warmed themselves in the kitchen while their room was being\nmade ready. Charles began to smoke. He smoked with lips protruding,\nspitting every moment, recoiling at every puff.\n\n\"You'll make yourself ill,\" she said scornfully.\n\nHe put down his cigar and ran to swallow a glass of cold water at the\npump. Emma seizing hold of the cigar case threw it quickly to the back\nof the cupboard.\n\nThe next day was a long one. She walked about her little garden, up\nand down the same walks, stopping before the beds, before the espalier,\nbefore the plaster curate, looking with amazement at all these things\nof once-on-a-time that she knew so well. How far off the ball seemed\nalready! What was it that thus set so far asunder the morning of the day\nbefore yesterday and the evening of to-day? Her journey to Vaubyessard\nhad made a hole in her life, like one of those great crevices that\na storm will sometimes make in one night in mountains. Still she was\nresigned. She devoutly put away in her drawers her beautiful dress, down\nto the satin shoes whose soles were yellowed with the slippery wax of\nthe dancing floor. Her heart was like these. In its friction against\nwealth something had come over it that could not be effaced.\n\nThe memory of this ball, then, became an occupation for Emma.\n\nWhenever the Wednesday came round she said to herself as she awoke, \"Ah!\nI was there a week--a fortnight--three weeks ago.\"\n\nAnd little by little the faces grew confused in her remembrance.\n\nShe forgot the tune of the quadrilles; she no longer saw the liveries\nand appointments so distinctly; some details escaped her, but the regret\nremained with her.\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\n\nOften when Charles was out she took from the cupboard, between the\nfolds of the linen where she had left it, the green silk cigar case.\nShe looked at it, opened it, and even smelt the odour of the lining--a\nmixture of verbena and tobacco. Whose was it? The Viscount's? Perhaps\nit was a present from his mistress. It had been embroidered on some\nrosewood frame, a pretty little thing, hidden from all eyes, that had\noccupied many hours, and over which had fallen the soft curls of the\npensive worker. A breath of love had passed over the stitches on the\ncanvas; each prick of the needle had fixed there a hope or a memory, and\nall those interwoven threads of silk were but the continuity of the same\nsilent passion. And then one morning the Viscount had taken it away\nwith him. Of what had they spoken when it lay upon the wide-mantelled\nchimneys between flower-vases and Pompadour clocks? She was at Tostes;\nhe was at Paris now, far away! What was this Paris like? What a vague\nname! She repeated it in a low voice, for the mere pleasure of it; it\nrang in her ears like a great cathedral bell; it shone before her eyes,\neven on the labels of her pomade-pots.\n\nAt night, when the carriers passed under her windows in their carts\nsinging the \"Marjolaine,\" she awoke, and listened to the noise of the\niron-bound wheels, which, as they gained the country road, was soon\ndeadened by the soil. \"They will be there to-morrow!\" she said to\nherself.\n\nAnd she followed them in thought up and down the hills, traversing\nvillages, gliding along the highroads by the light of the stars. At the\nend of some indefinite distance there was always a confused spot, into\nwhich her dream died.\n\nShe bought a plan of Paris, and with the tip of her finger on the map\nshe walked about the capital. She went up the boulevards, stopping at\nevery turning, between the lines of the streets, in front of the white\nsquares that represented the houses. At last she would close the lids of\nher weary eyes, and see in the darkness the gas jets flaring in the wind\nand the steps of carriages lowered with much noise before the peristyles\nof theatres.\n\nShe took in \"La Corbeille,\" a lady's journal, and the \"Sylphe des\nSalons.\" She devoured, without skipping a word, all the accounts of\nfirst nights, races, and soirees, took interest in the debut of a\nsinger, in the opening of a new shop. She knew the latest fashions, the\naddresses of the best tailors, the days of the Bois and the Opera. In\nEugene Sue she studied descriptions of furniture; she read Balzac and\nGeorge Sand, seeking in them imaginary satisfaction for her own desires.\nEven at table she had her book by her, and turned over the pages\nwhile Charles ate and talked to her. The memory of the Viscount always\nreturned as she read. Between him and the imaginary personages she made\ncomparisons. But the circle of which he was the centre gradually widened\nround him, and the aureole that he bore, fading from his form, broadened\nout beyond, lighting up her other dreams.\n\nParis, more vague than the ocean, glimmered before Emma's eyes in an\natmosphere of vermilion. The many lives that stirred amid this tumult\nwere, however, divided into parts, classed as distinct pictures. Emma\nperceived only two or three that hid from her all the rest, and in\nthemselves represented all humanity. The world of ambassadors moved over\npolished floors in drawing rooms lined with mirrors, round oval tables\ncovered with velvet and gold-fringed cloths. There were dresses with\ntrains, deep mysteries, anguish hidden beneath smiles. Then came the\nsociety of the duchesses; all were pale; all got up at four o'clock; the\nwomen, poor angels, wore English point on their petticoats; and the men,\nunappreciated geniuses under a frivolous outward seeming, rode horses to\ndeath at pleasure parties, spent the summer season at Baden, and towards\nthe forties married heiresses. In the private rooms of restaurants,\nwhere one sups after midnight by the light of wax candles, laughed the\nmotley crowd of men of letters and actresses. They were prodigal as\nkings, full of ideal, ambitious, fantastic frenzy. This was an existence\noutside that of all others, between heaven and earth, in the midst of\nstorms, having something of the sublime. For the rest of the world it\nwas lost, with no particular place and as if non-existent. The nearer\nthings were, moreover, the more her thoughts turned away from them.\nAll her immediate surroundings, the wearisome country, the middle-class\nimbeciles, the mediocrity of existence, seemed to her exceptional, a\npeculiar chance that had caught hold of her, while beyond stretched, as\nfar as eye could see, an immense land of joys and passions. She confused\nin her desire the sensualities of luxury with the delights of the heart,\nelegance of manners with delicacy of sentiment. Did not love, like\nIndian plants, need a special soil, a particular temperature? Signs\nby moonlight, long embraces, tears flowing over yielded hands, all\nthe fevers of the flesh and the languors of tenderness could not be\nseparated from the balconies of great castles full of indolence,\nfrom boudoirs with silken curtains and thick carpets, well-filled\nflower-stands, a bed on a raised dias, nor from the flashing of precious\nstones and the shoulder-knots of liveries.\n\nThe lad from the posting house who came to groom the mare every morning\npassed through the passage with his heavy wooden shoes; there were holes\nin his blouse; his feet were bare in list slippers. And this was the\ngroom in knee-britches with whom she had to be content! His work done,\nhe did not come back again all day, for Charles on his return put up\nhis horse himself, unsaddled him and put on the halter, while the\nservant-girl brought a bundle of straw and threw it as best she could\ninto the manger.\n\nTo replace Nastasie (who left Tostes shedding torrents of tears) Emma\ntook into her service a young girl of fourteen, an orphan with a sweet\nface. She forbade her wearing cotton caps, taught her to address her in\nthe third person, to bring a glass of water on a plate, to knock before\ncoming into a room, to iron, starch, and to dress her--wanted to make a\nlady's-maid of her. The new servant obeyed without a murmur, so as not\nto be sent away; and as madame usually left the key in the sideboard,\nFelicite every evening took a small supply of sugar that she ate alone\nin her bed after she had said her prayers.\n\nSometimes in the afternoon she went to chat with the postilions.\n\nMadame was in her room upstairs. She wore an open dressing gown that\nshowed between the shawl facings of her bodice a pleated chamisette with\nthree gold buttons. Her belt was a corded girdle with great tassels, and\nher small garnet coloured slippers had a large knot of ribbon that fell\nover her instep. She had bought herself a blotting book, writing case,\npen-holder, and envelopes, although she had no one to write to; she\ndusted her what-not, looked at herself in the glass, picked up a book,\nand then, dreaming between the lines, let it drop on her knees. She\nlonged to travel or to go back to her convent. She wished at the same\ntime to die and to live in Paris.\n\nCharles in snow and rain trotted across country. He ate omelettes on\nfarmhouse tables, poked his arm into damp beds, received the tepid\nspurt of blood-lettings in his face, listened to death-rattles, examined\nbasins, turned over a good deal of dirty linen; but every evening he\nfound a blazing fire, his dinner ready, easy-chairs, and a well-dressed\nwoman, charming with an odour of freshness, though no one could say\nwhence the perfume came, or if it were not her skin that made odorous\nher chemise.\n\nShe charmed him by numerous attentions; now it was some new way of\narranging paper sconces for the candles, a flounce that she altered on\nher gown, or an extraordinary name for some very simple dish that the\nservant had spoilt, but that Charles swallowed with pleasure to the last\nmouthful. At Rouen she saw some ladies who wore a bunch of charms on the\nwatch-chains; she bought some charms. She wanted for her mantelpiece two\nlarge blue glass vases, and some time after an ivory necessaire with a\nsilver-gilt thimble. The less Charles understood these refinements\nthe more they seduced him. They added something to the pleasure of the\nsenses and to the comfort of his fireside. It was like a golden dust\nsanding all along the narrow path of his life.\n\nHe was well, looked well; his reputation was firmly established.\n\nThe country-folk loved him because he was not proud. He petted the\nchildren, never went to the public house, and, moreover, his morals\ninspired confidence. He was specially successful with catarrhs and chest\ncomplaints. Being much afraid of killing his patients, Charles, in fact\nonly prescribed sedatives, from time to time and emetic, a footbath,\nor leeches. It was not that he was afraid of surgery; he bled people\ncopiously like horses, and for the taking out of teeth he had the\n\"devil's own wrist.\"\n\nFinally, to keep up with the times, he took in \"La Ruche Medicale,\"\na new journal whose prospectus had been sent him. He read it a little\nafter dinner, but in about five minutes the warmth of the room added to\nthe effect of his dinner sent him to sleep; and he sat there, his chin\non his two hands and his hair spreading like a mane to the foot of the\nlamp. Emma looked at him and shrugged her shoulders. Why, at least, was\nnot her husband one of those men of taciturn passions who work at their\nbooks all night, and at last, when about sixty, the age of rheumatism\nsets in, wear a string of orders on their ill-fitting black coat?\nShe could have wished this name of Bovary, which was hers, had been\nillustrious, to see it displayed at the booksellers', repeated in the\nnewspapers, known to all France. But Charles had no ambition.\n\nAn Yvetot doctor whom he had lately met in consultation had somewhat\nhumiliated him at the very bedside of the patient, before the assembled\nrelatives. When, in the evening, Charles told her this anecdote, Emma\ninveighed loudly against his colleague. Charles was much touched. He\nkissed her forehead with a tear in his eyes. But she was angered with\nshame; she felt a wild desire to strike him; she went to open the window\nin the passage and breathed in the fresh air to calm herself.\n\n\"What a man! What a man!\" she said in a low voice, biting her lips.\n\nBesides, she was becoming more irritated with him. As he grew older his\nmanner grew heavier; at dessert he cut the corks of the empty bottles;\nafter eating he cleaned his teeth with his tongue; in taking soup\nhe made a gurgling noise with every spoonful; and, as he was getting\nfatter, the puffed-out cheeks seemed to push the eyes, always small, up\nto the temples.\n\nSometimes Emma tucked the red borders of his under-vest unto his\nwaistcoat, rearranged his cravat, and threw away the dirty gloves he was\ngoing to put on; and this was not, as he fancied, for himself; it\nwas for herself, by a diffusion of egotism, of nervous irritation.\nSometimes, too, she told him of what she had read, such as a passage in\na novel, of a new play, or an anecdote of the \"upper ten\" that she\nhad seen in a feuilleton; for, after all, Charles was something, an\never-open ear, and ever-ready approbation. She confided many a thing to\nher greyhound. She would have done so to the logs in the fireplace or to\nthe pendulum of the clock.\n\nAt the bottom of her heart, however, she was waiting for something to\nhappen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the\nsolitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of\nthe horizon. She did not know what this chance would be, what wind would\nbring it her, towards what shore it would drive her, if it would be a\nshallop or a three-decker, laden with anguish or full of bliss to the\nportholes. But each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that\nday; she listened to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that\nit did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she longed for\nthe morrow.\n\nSpring came round. With the first warm weather, when the pear trees\nbegan to blossom, she suffered from dyspnoea.\n\nFrom the beginning of July she counted how many weeks there were to\nOctober, thinking that perhaps the Marquis d'Andervilliers would give\nanother ball at Vaubyessard. But all September passed without letters or\nvisits.\n\nAfter the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more remained\nempty, and then the same series of days recommenced. So now they would\nthus follow one another, always the same, immovable, and bringing\nnothing. Other lives, however flat, had at least the chance of some\nevent. One adventure sometimes brought with it infinite consequences and\nthe scene changed. But nothing happened to her; God had willed it so!\nThe future was a dark corridor, with its door at the end shut fast.\n\nShe gave up music. What was the good of playing? Who would hear her?\nSince she could never, in a velvet gown with short sleeves, striking\nwith her light fingers the ivory keys of an Erard at a concert, feel\nthe murmur of ecstasy envelop her like a breeze, it was not worth while\nboring herself with practicing. Her drawing cardboard and her embroidery\nshe left in the cupboard. What was the good? What was the good? Sewing\nirritated her. \"I have read everything,\" she said to herself. And she\nsat there making the tongs red-hot, or looked at the rain falling.\n\nHow sad she was on Sundays when vespers sounded! She listened with dull\nattention to each stroke of the cracked bell. A cat slowly walking over\nsome roof put up his back in the pale rays of the sun. The wind on the\nhighroad blew up clouds of dust. Afar off a dog sometimes howled; and\nthe bell, keeping time, continued its monotonous ringing that died away\nover the fields.\n\nBut the people came out from church. The women in waxed clogs, the\npeasants in new blouses, the little bare-headed children skipping along\nin front of them, all were going home. And till nightfall, five or six\nmen, always the same, stayed playing at corks in front of the large door\nof the inn.\n\nThe winter was severe. The windows every morning were covered with\nrime, and the light shining through them, dim as through ground-glass,\nsometimes did not change the whole day long. At four o'clock the lamp\nhad to be lighted.\n\nOn fine days she went down into the garden. The dew had left on the\ncabbages a silver lace with long transparent threads spreading from one\nto the other. No birds were to be heard; everything seemed asleep, the\nespalier covered with straw, and the vine, like a great sick serpent\nunder the coping of the wall, along which, on drawing near, one saw the\nmany-footed woodlice crawling. Under the spruce by the hedgerow, the\ncurie in the three-cornered hat reading his breviary had lost his right\nfoot, and the very plaster, scaling off with the frost, had left white\nscabs on his face.\n\nThen she went up again, shut her door, put on coals, and fainting with\nthe heat of the hearth, felt her boredom weigh more heavily than ever.\nShe would have liked to go down and talk to the servant, but a sense of\nshame restrained her.\n\nEvery day at the same time the schoolmaster in a black skullcap opened\nthe shutters of his house, and the rural policeman, wearing his sabre\nover his blouse, passed by. Night and morning the post-horses, three by\nthree, crossed the street to water at the pond. From time to time the\nbell of a public house door rang, and when it was windy one could hear\nthe little brass basins that served as signs for the hairdresser's shop\ncreaking on their two rods. This shop had as decoration an old engraving\nof a fashion-plate stuck against a windowpane and the wax bust of a\nwoman with yellow hair. He, too, the hairdresser, lamented his wasted\ncalling, his hopeless future, and dreaming of some shop in a big\ntown--at Rouen, for example, overlooking the harbour, near the\ntheatre--he walked up and down all day from the mairie to the church,\nsombre and waiting for customers. When Madame Bovary looked up, she\nalways saw him there, like a sentinel on duty, with his skullcap over\nhis ears and his vest of lasting.\n\nSometimes in the afternoon outside the window of her room, the head of a\nman appeared, a swarthy head with black whiskers, smiling slowly, with\na broad, gentle smile that showed his white teeth. A waltz immediately\nbegan and on the organ, in a little drawing room, dancers the size of\na finger, women in pink turbans, Tyrolians in jackets, monkeys in frock\ncoats, gentlemen in knee-breeches, turned and turned between the sofas,\nthe consoles, multiplied in the bits of looking glass held together\nat their corners by a piece of gold paper. The man turned his handle,\nlooking to the right and left, and up at the windows. Now and again,\nwhile he shot out a long squirt of brown saliva against the milestone,\nwith his knee raised his instrument, whose hard straps tired his\nshoulder; and now, doleful and drawling, or gay and hurried, the music\nescaped from the box, droning through a curtain of pink taffeta under\na brass claw in arabesque. They were airs played in other places at\nthe theatres, sung in drawing rooms, danced to at night under lighted\nlustres, echoes of the world that reached even to Emma. Endless\nsarabands ran through her head, and, like an Indian dancing girl on the\nflowers of a carpet, her thoughts leapt with the notes, swung from dream\nto dream, from sadness to sadness. When the man had caught some coppers\nin his cap, he drew down an old cover of blue cloth, hitched his organ\non to his back, and went off with a heavy tread. She watched him going.\n\nBut it was above all the meal-times that were unbearable to her, in this\nsmall room on the ground floor, with its smoking stove, its creaking\ndoor, the walls that sweated, the damp flags; all the bitterness in life\nseemed served up on her plate, and with smoke of the boiled beef there\nrose from her secret soul whiffs of sickliness. Charles was a slow\neater; she played with a few nuts, or, leaning on her elbow, amused\nherself with drawing lines along the oilcloth table cover with the point\nof her knife.\n\nShe now let everything in her household take care of itself, and Madame\nBovary senior, when she came to spend part of Lent at Tostes, was much\nsurprised at the change. She who was formerly so careful, so dainty,\nnow passed whole days without dressing, wore grey cotton stockings, and\nburnt tallow candles. She kept saying they must be economical since\nthey were not rich, adding that she was very contented, very happy, that\nTostes pleased her very much, with other speeches that closed the mouth\nof her mother-in-law. Besides, Emma no longer seemed inclined to follow\nher advice; once even, Madame Bovary having thought fit to maintain that\nmistresses ought to keep an eye on the religion of their servants, she\nhad answered with so angry a look and so cold a smile that the good\nwoman did not interfere again.\n\nEmma was growing difficult, capricious. She ordered dishes for herself,\nthen she did not touch them; one day drank only pure milk, the next\ncups of tea by the dozen. Often she persisted in not going out, then,\nstifling, threw open the windows and put on light dresses. After she had\nwell scolded her servant she gave her presents or sent her out to see\nneighbours, just as she sometimes threw beggars all the silver in her\npurse, although she was by no means tender-hearted or easily accessible\nto the feelings of others, like most country-bred people, who always\nretain in their souls something of the horny hardness of the paternal\nhands.\n\nTowards the end of February old Rouault, in memory of his cure, himself\nbrought his son-in-law a superb turkey, and stayed three days at Tostes.\nCharles being with his patients, Emma kept him company. He smoked in the\nroom, spat on the firedogs, talked farming, calves, cows, poultry, and\nmunicipal council, so that when he left she closed the door on him with\na feeling of satisfaction that surprised even herself. Moreover she no\nlonger concealed her contempt for anything or anybody, and at times she\nset herself to express singular opinions, finding fault with that which\nothers approved, and approving things perverse and immoral, all of which\nmade her husband open his eyes widely.\n\nWould this misery last for ever? Would she never issue from it? Yet\nshe was as good as all the women who were living happily. She had seen\nduchesses at Vaubyessard with clumsier waists and commoner ways, and she\nexecrated the injustice of God. She leant her head against the walls\nto weep; she envied lives of stir; longed for masked balls, for violent\npleasures, with all the wildness that she did not know, but that these\nmust surely yield.\n\nShe grew pale and suffered from palpitations of the heart.\n\nCharles prescribed valerian and camphor baths. Everything that was tried\nonly seemed to irritate her the more.\n\nOn certain days she chatted with feverish rapidity, and this\nover-excitement was suddenly followed by a state of torpor, in which\nshe remained without speaking, without moving. What then revived her was\npouring a bottle of eau-de-cologne over her arms.\n\nAs she was constantly complaining about Tostes, Charles fancied that her\nillness was no doubt due to some local cause, and fixing on this idea,\nbegan to think seriously of setting up elsewhere.\n\nFrom that moment she drank vinegar, contracted a sharp little cough, and\ncompletely lost her appetite.\n\nIt cost Charles much to give up Tostes after living there four years and\n\"when he was beginning to get on there.\" Yet if it must be! He took her\nto Rouen to see his old master. It was a nervous complaint: change of\nair was needed.\n\nAfter looking about him on this side and on that, Charles learnt that\nin the Neufchatel arrondissement there was a considerable market town\ncalled Yonville-l'Abbaye, whose doctor, a Polish refugee, had decamped a\nweek before. Then he wrote to the chemist of the place to ask the\nnumber of the population, the distance from the nearest doctor, what\nhis predecessor had made a year, and so forth; and the answer being\nsatisfactory, he made up his mind to move towards the spring, if Emma's\nhealth did not improve.\n\nOne day when, in view of her departure, she was tidying a drawer,\nsomething pricked her finger. It was a wire of her wedding bouquet.\nThe orange blossoms were yellow with dust and the silver bordered satin\nribbons frayed at the edges. She threw it into the fire. It flared\nup more quickly than dry straw. Then it was, like a red bush in the\ncinders, slowly devoured. She watched it burn.\n\nThe little pasteboard berries burst, the wire twisted, the gold\nlace melted; and the shriveled paper corollas, fluttering like black\nbutterflies at the back of the stove, at last flew up the chimney.\n\nWhen they left Tostes at the month of March, Madame Bovary was pregnant.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart II\n\n\n\nChapter One\n\nYonville-l'Abbaye (so called from an old Capuchin abbey of which not\neven the ruins remain) is a market-town twenty-four miles from Rouen,\nbetween the Abbeville and Beauvais roads, at the foot of a valley\nwatered by the Rieule, a little river that runs into the Andelle after\nturning three water-mills near its mouth, where there are a few trout\nthat the lads amuse themselves by fishing for on Sundays.\n\nWe leave the highroad at La Boissiere and keep straight on to the top of\nthe Leux hill, whence the valley is seen. The river that runs through it\nmakes of it, as it were, two regions with distinct physiognomies--all on\nthe left is pasture land, all of the right arable. The meadow stretches\nunder a bulge of low hills to join at the back with the pasture land of\nthe Bray country, while on the eastern side, the plain, gently rising,\nbroadens out, showing as far as eye can follow its blond cornfields. The\nwater, flowing by the grass, divides with a white line the colour of the\nroads and of the plains, and the country is like a great unfolded mantle\nwith a green velvet cape bordered with a fringe of silver.\n\nBefore us, on the verge of the horizon, lie the oaks of the forest of\nArgueil, with the steeps of the Saint-Jean hills scarred from top\nto bottom with red irregular lines; they are rain tracks, and these\nbrick-tones standing out in narrow streaks against the grey colour of\nthe mountain are due to the quantity of iron springs that flow beyond in\nthe neighboring country.\n\nHere we are on the confines of Normandy, Picardy, and the Ile-de-France,\na bastard land whose language is without accent and its landscape is\nwithout character. It is there that they make the worst Neufchatel\ncheeses of all the arrondissement; and, on the other hand, farming is\ncostly because so much manure is needed to enrich this friable soil full\nof sand and flints.\n\nUp to 1835 there was no practicable road for getting to Yonville, but\nabout this time a cross-road was made which joins that of Abbeville to\nthat of Amiens, and is occasionally used by the Rouen wagoners on their\nway to Flanders. Yonville-l'Abbaye has remained stationary in spite of\nits \"new outlet.\" Instead of improving the soil, they persist in keeping\nup the pasture lands, however depreciated they may be in value, and\nthe lazy borough, growing away from the plain, has naturally spread\nriverwards. It is seem from afar sprawling along the banks like a\ncowherd taking a siesta by the water-side.\n\nAt the foot of the hill beyond the bridge begins a roadway, planted with\nyoung aspens, that leads in a straight line to the first houses in the\nplace. These, fenced in by hedges, are in the middle of courtyards\nfull of straggling buildings, wine-presses, cart-sheds and distilleries\nscattered under thick trees, with ladders, poles, or scythes hung on to\nthe branches. The thatched roofs, like fur caps drawn over eyes, reach\ndown over about a third of the low windows, whose coarse convex glasses\nhave knots in the middle like the bottoms of bottles. Against the\nplaster wall diagonally crossed by black joists, a meagre pear-tree\nsometimes leans and the ground-floors have at their door a small\nswing-gate to keep out the chicks that come pilfering crumbs of bread\nsteeped in cider on the threshold. But the courtyards grow narrower,\nthe houses closer together, and the fences disappear; a bundle of\nferns swings under a window from the end of a broomstick; there is a\nblacksmith's forge and then a wheelwright's, with two or three new carts\noutside that partly block the way. Then across an open space appears a\nwhite house beyond a grass mound ornamented by a Cupid, his finger\non his lips; two brass vases are at each end of a flight of steps;\nscutcheons* blaze upon the door. It is the notary's house, and the\nfinest in the place.\n\n     *The panonceaux that have to be hung over the doors of\n     notaries.\n\nThe Church is on the other side of the street, twenty paces farther\ndown, at the entrance of the square. The little cemetery that surrounds\nit, closed in by a wall breast high, is so full of graves that the old\nstones, level with the ground, form a continuous pavement, on which the\ngrass of itself has marked out regular green squares. The church was\nrebuilt during the last years of the reign of Charles X. The wooden roof\nis beginning to rot from the top, and here and there has black hollows\nin its blue colour. Over the door, where the organ should be, is a\nloft for the men, with a spiral staircase that reverberates under their\nwooden shoes.\n\nThe daylight coming through the plain glass windows falls obliquely upon\nthe pews ranged along the walls, which are adorned here and there with\na straw mat bearing beneath it the words in large letters, \"Mr.\nSo-and-so's pew.\" Farther on, at a spot where the building narrows, the\nconfessional forms a pendant to a statuette of the Virgin, clothed in\na satin robe, coifed with a tulle veil sprinkled with silver stars, and\nwith red cheeks, like an idol of the Sandwich Islands; and, finally, a\ncopy of the \"Holy Family, presented by the Minister of the Interior,\"\noverlooking the high altar, between four candlesticks, closes in the\nperspective. The choir stalls, of deal wood, have been left unpainted.\n\nThe market, that is to say, a tiled roof supported by some twenty posts,\noccupies of itself about half the public square of Yonville. The town\nhall, constructed \"from the designs of a Paris architect,\" is a sort of\nGreek temple that forms the corner next to the chemist's shop. On\nthe ground-floor are three Ionic columns and on the first floor a\nsemicircular gallery, while the dome that crowns it is occupied by a\nGallic cock, resting one foot upon the \"Charte\" and holding in the other\nthe scales of Justice.\n\nBut that which most attracts the eye is opposite the Lion d'Or inn, the\nchemist's shop of Monsieur Homais. In the evening especially its argand\nlamp is lit up and the red and green jars that embellish his shop-front\nthrow far across the street their two streams of colour; then across\nthem as if in Bengal lights is seen the shadow of the chemist\nleaning over his desk. His house from top to bottom is placarded with\ninscriptions written in large hand, round hand, printed hand: \"Vichy,\nSeltzer, Barege waters, blood purifiers, Raspail patent medicine,\nArabian racahout, Darcet lozenges, Regnault paste, trusses, baths,\nhygienic chocolate,\" etc. And the signboard, which takes up all the\nbreadth of the shop, bears in gold letters, \"Homais, Chemist.\" Then at\nthe back of the shop, behind the great scales fixed to the counter, the\nword \"Laboratory\" appears on a scroll above a glass door, which about\nhalf-way up once more repeats \"Homais\" in gold letters on a black\nground.\n\nBeyond this there is nothing to see at Yonville. The street (the only\none) a gunshot in length and flanked by a few shops on either side stops\nshort at the turn of the highroad. If it is left on the right hand and\nthe foot of the Saint-Jean hills followed the cemetery is soon reached.\n\nAt the time of the cholera, in order to enlarge this, a piece of wall\nwas pulled down, and three acres of land by its side purchased; but all\nthe new portion is almost tenantless; the tombs, as heretofore,\ncontinue to crowd together towards the gate. The keeper, who is at once\ngravedigger and church beadle (thus making a double profit out of the\nparish corpses), has taken advantage of the unused plot of ground to\nplant potatoes there. From year to year, however, his small field grows\nsmaller, and when there is an epidemic, he does not know whether to\nrejoice at the deaths or regret the burials.\n\n\"You live on the dead, Lestiboudois!\" the curie at last said to him one\nday. This grim remark made him reflect; it checked him for some time;\nbut to this day he carries on the cultivation of his little tubers, and\neven maintains stoutly that they grow naturally.\n\nSince the events about to be narrated, nothing in fact has changed\nat Yonville. The tin tricolour flag still swings at the top of the\nchurch-steeple; the two chintz streamers still flutter in the wind from\nthe linen-draper's; the chemist's fetuses, like lumps of white amadou,\nrot more and more in their turbid alcohol, and above the big door of\nthe inn the old golden lion, faded by rain, still shows passers-by its\npoodle mane.\n\nOn the evening when the Bovarys were to arrive at Yonville, Widow\nLefrancois, the landlady of this inn, was so very busy that she sweated\ngreat drops as she moved her saucepans. To-morrow was market-day. The\nmeat had to be cut beforehand, the fowls drawn, the soup and coffee\nmade. Moreover, she had the boarders' meal to see to, and that of the\ndoctor, his wife, and their servant; the billiard-room was echoing with\nbursts of laughter; three millers in a small parlour were calling for\nbrandy; the wood was blazing, the brazen pan was hissing, and on the\nlong kitchen table, amid the quarters of raw mutton, rose piles of\nplates that rattled with the shaking of the block on which spinach was\nbeing chopped.\n\nFrom the poultry-yard was heard the screaming of the fowls whom the\nservant was chasing in order to wring their necks.\n\nA man slightly marked with small-pox, in green leather slippers, and\nwearing a velvet cap with a gold tassel, was warming his back at the\nchimney. His face expressed nothing but self-satisfaction, and he\nappeared to take life as calmly as the goldfinch suspended over his head\nin its wicker cage: this was the chemist.\n\n\"Artemise!\" shouted the landlady, \"chop some wood, fill the water\nbottles, bring some brandy, look sharp! If only I knew what dessert to\noffer the guests you are expecting! Good heavens! Those furniture-movers\nare beginning their racket in the billiard-room again; and their van has\nbeen left before the front door! The 'Hirondelle' might run into it when\nit draws up. Call Polyte and tell him to put it up. Only think, Monsieur\nHomais, that since morning they have had about fifteen games, and drunk\neight jars of cider! Why, they'll tear my cloth for me,\" she went on,\nlooking at them from a distance, her strainer in her hand.\n\n\"That wouldn't be much of a loss,\" replied Monsieur Homais. \"You would\nbuy another.\"\n\n\"Another billiard-table!\" exclaimed the widow.\n\n\"Since that one is coming to pieces, Madame Lefrancois. I tell you again\nyou are doing yourself harm, much harm! And besides, players now want\nnarrow pockets and heavy cues. Hazards aren't played now; everything is\nchanged! One must keep pace with the times! Just look at Tellier!\"\n\nThe hostess reddened with vexation. The chemist went on--\n\n\"You may say what you like; his table is better than yours; and if one\nwere to think, for example, of getting up a patriotic pool for Poland or\nthe sufferers from the Lyons floods--\"\n\n\"It isn't beggars like him that'll frighten us,\" interrupted the\nlandlady, shrugging her fat shoulders. \"Come, come, Monsieur Homais; as\nlong as the 'Lion d'Or' exists people will come to it. We've feathered\nour nest; while one of these days you'll find the 'Cafe Francais' closed\nwith a big placard on the shutters. Change my billiard-table!\" she went\non, speaking to herself, \"the table that comes in so handy for folding\nthe washing, and on which, in the hunting season, I have slept six\nvisitors! But that dawdler, Hivert, doesn't come!\"\n\n\"Are you waiting for him for your gentlemen's dinner?\"\n\n\"Wait for him! And what about Monsieur Binet? As the clock strikes\nsix you'll see him come in, for he hasn't his equal under the sun for\npunctuality. He must always have his seat in the small parlour. He'd\nrather die than dine anywhere else. And so squeamish as he is, and so\nparticular about the cider! Not like Monsieur Leon; he sometimes comes\nat seven, or even half-past, and he doesn't so much as look at what he\neats. Such a nice young man! Never speaks a rough word!\"\n\n\"Well, you see, there's a great difference between an educated man and\nan old carabineer who is now a tax-collector.\"\n\nSix o'clock struck. Binet came in.\n\nHe wore a blue frock-coat falling in a straight line round his thin\nbody, and his leather cap, with its lappets knotted over the top of\nhis head with string, showed under the turned-up peak a bald forehead,\nflattened by the constant wearing of a helmet. He wore a black cloth\nwaistcoat, a hair collar, grey trousers, and, all the year round,\nwell-blacked boots, that had two parallel swellings due to the sticking\nout of his big-toes. Not a hair stood out from the regular line of fair\nwhiskers, which, encircling his jaws, framed, after the fashion of a\ngarden border, his long, wan face, whose eyes were small and the nose\nhooked. Clever at all games of cards, a good hunter, and writing a\nfine hand, he had at home a lathe, and amused himself by turning napkin\nrings, with which he filled up his house, with the jealousy of an artist\nand the egotism of a bourgeois.\n\nHe went to the small parlour, but the three millers had to be got out\nfirst, and during the whole time necessary for laying the cloth, Binet\nremained silent in his place near the stove. Then he shut the door and\ntook off his cap in his usual way.\n\n\"It isn't with saying civil things that he'll wear out his tongue,\" said\nthe chemist, as soon as he was along with the landlady.\n\n\"He never talks more,\" she replied. \"Last week two travelers in the\ncloth line were here--such clever chaps who told such jokes in the\nevening, that I fairly cried with laughing; and he stood there like a\ndab fish and never said a word.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" observed the chemist; \"no imagination, no sallies, nothing that\nmakes the society-man.\"\n\n\"Yet they say he has parts,\" objected the landlady.\n\n\"Parts!\" replied Monsieur Homais; \"he, parts! In his own line it is\npossible,\" he added in a calmer tone. And he went on--\n\n\"Ah! That a merchant, who has large connections, a jurisconsult, a\ndoctor, a chemist, should be thus absent-minded, that they should become\nwhimsical or even peevish, I can understand; such cases are cited in\nhistory. But at least it is because they are thinking of something.\nMyself, for example, how often has it happened to me to look on the\nbureau for my pen to write a label, and to find, after all, that I had\nput it behind my ear!\"\n\nMadame Lefrancois just then went to the door to see if the \"Hirondelle\"\nwere not coming. She started. A man dressed in black suddenly came into\nthe kitchen. By the last gleam of the twilight one could see that his\nface was rubicund and his form athletic.\n\n\"What can I do for you, Monsieur le Curie?\" asked the landlady, as she\nreached down from the chimney one of the copper candlesticks placed\nwith their candles in a row. \"Will you take something? A thimbleful of\nCassis*? A glass of wine?\"\n\n     *Black currant liqueur.\n\nThe priest declined very politely. He had come for his umbrella, that\nhe had forgotten the other day at the Ernemont convent, and after\nasking Madame Lefrancois to have it sent to him at the presbytery in the\nevening, he left for the church, from which the Angelus was ringing.\n\nWhen the chemist no longer heard the noise of his boots along the\nsquare, he thought the priest's behaviour just now very unbecoming. This\nrefusal to take any refreshment seemed to him the most odious hypocrisy;\nall priests tippled on the sly, and were trying to bring back the days\nof the tithe.\n\nThe landlady took up the defence of her curie.\n\n\"Besides, he could double up four men like you over his knee. Last year\nhe helped our people to bring in the straw; he carried as many as six\ntrusses at once, he is so strong.\"\n\n\"Bravo!\" said the chemist. \"Now just send your daughters to confess to\nfellows which such a temperament! I, if I were the Government, I'd have\nthe priests bled once a month. Yes, Madame Lefrancois, every month--a\ngood phlebotomy, in the interests of the police and morals.\"\n\n\"Be quiet, Monsieur Homais. You are an infidel; you've no religion.\"\n\nThe chemist answered: \"I have a religion, my religion, and I even have\nmore than all these others with their mummeries and their juggling.\nI adore God, on the contrary. I believe in the Supreme Being, in a\nCreator, whatever he may be. I care little who has placed us here below\nto fulfil our duties as citizens and fathers of families; but I don't\nneed to go to church to kiss silver plates, and fatten, out of my\npocket, a lot of good-for-nothings who live better than we do. For one\ncan know Him as well in a wood, in a field, or even contemplating the\neternal vault like the ancients. My God! Mine is the God of Socrates, of\nFranklin, of Voltaire, and of Beranger! I am for the profession of faith\nof the 'Savoyard Vicar,' and the immortal principles of '89! And I can't\nadmit of an old boy of a God who takes walks in his garden with a\ncane in his hand, who lodges his friends in the belly of whales, dies\nuttering a cry, and rises again at the end of three days; things absurd\nin themselves, and completely opposed, moreover, to all physical laws,\nwhich prove to us, by the way, that priests have always wallowed in\nturpid ignorance, in which they would fain engulf the people with them.\"\n\nHe ceased, looking round for an audience, for in his bubbling over\nthe chemist had for a moment fancied himself in the midst of the town\ncouncil. But the landlady no longer heeded him; she was listening to a\ndistant rolling. One could distinguish the noise of a carriage mingled\nwith the clattering of loose horseshoes that beat against the ground,\nand at last the \"Hirondelle\" stopped at the door.\n\nIt was a yellow box on two large wheels, that, reaching to the tilt,\nprevented travelers from seeing the road and dirtied their shoulders.\nThe small panes of the narrow windows rattled in their sashes when the\ncoach was closed, and retained here and there patches of mud amid the\nold layers of dust, that not even storms of rain had altogether washed\naway. It was drawn by three horses, the first a leader, and when it came\ndown-hill its bottom jolted against the ground.\n\nSome of the inhabitants of Yonville came out into the square; they all\nspoke at once, asking for news, for explanations, for hampers. Hivert\ndid not know whom to answer. It was he who did the errands of the place\nin town. He went to the shops and brought back rolls of leather for\nthe shoemaker, old iron for the farrier, a barrel of herrings for his\nmistress, caps from the milliner's, locks from the hair-dresser's and\nall along the road on his return journey he distributed his parcels,\nwhich he threw, standing upright on his seat and shouting at the top of\nhis voice, over the enclosures of the yards.\n\nAn accident had delayed him. Madame Bovary's greyhound had run across\nthe field. They had whistled for him a quarter of an hour; Hivert had\neven gone back a mile and a half expecting every moment to catch sight\nof her; but it had been necessary to go on.\n\nEmma had wept, grown angry; she had accused Charles of this misfortune.\nMonsieur Lheureux, a draper, who happened to be in the coach with\nher, had tried to console her by a number of examples of lost dogs\nrecognizing their masters at the end of long years. One, he said had\nbeen told of, who had come back to Paris from Constantinople. Another\nhad gone one hundred and fifty miles in a straight line, and swum four\nrivers; and his own father had possessed a poodle, which, after twelve\nyears of absence, had all of a sudden jumped on his back in the street\nas he was going to dine in town.\n\n\n\nChapter Two\n\nEmma got out first, then Felicite, Monsieur Lheureux, and a nurse, and\nthey had to wake up Charles in his corner, where he had slept soundly\nsince night set in.\n\nHomais introduced himself; he offered his homages to madame and his\nrespects to monsieur; said he was charmed to have been able to render\nthem some slight service, and added with a cordial air that he had\nventured to invite himself, his wife being away.\n\nWhen Madame Bovary was in the kitchen she went up to the chimney.\n\nWith the tips of her fingers she caught her dress at the knee, and\nhaving thus pulled it up to her ankle, held out her foot in its black\nboot to the fire above the revolving leg of mutton. The flame lit up the\nwhole of her, penetrating with a crude light the woof of her gowns, the\nfine pores of her fair skin, and even her eyelids, which she blinked now\nand again. A great red glow passed over her with the blowing of the wind\nthrough the half-open door.\n\nOn the other side of the chimney a young man with fair hair watched her\nsilently.\n\nAs he was a good deal bored at Yonville, where he was a clerk at the\nnotary's, Monsieur Guillaumin, Monsieur Leon Dupuis (it was he who\nwas the second habitue of the \"Lion d'Or\") frequently put back his\ndinner-hour in hope that some traveler might come to the inn, with whom\nhe could chat in the evening. On the days when his work was done early,\nhe had, for want of something else to do, to come punctually, and endure\nfrom soup to cheese a tete-a-tete with Binet. It was therefore with\ndelight that he accepted the landlady's suggestion that he should dine\nin company with the newcomers, and they passed into the large parlour\nwhere Madame Lefrancois, for the purpose of showing off, had had the\ntable laid for four.\n\nHomais asked to be allowed to keep on his skull-cap, for fear of coryza;\nthen, turning to his neighbour--\n\n\"Madame is no doubt a little fatigued; one gets jolted so abominably in\nour 'Hirondelle.'\"\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Emma; \"but moving about always amuses me. I like\nchange of place.\"\n\n\"It is so tedious,\" sighed the clerk, \"to be always riveted to the same\nplaces.\"\n\n\"If you were like me,\" said Charles, \"constantly obliged to be in the\nsaddle\"--\n\n\"But,\" Leon went on, addressing himself to Madame Bovary, \"nothing, it\nseems to me, is more pleasant--when one can,\" he added.\n\n\"Moreover,\" said the druggist, \"the practice of medicine is not very\nhard work in our part of the world, for the state of our roads allows us\nthe use of gigs, and generally, as the farmers are prosperous, they pay\npretty well. We have, medically speaking, besides the ordinary cases\nof enteritis, bronchitis, bilious affections, etc., now and then a\nfew intermittent fevers at harvest-time; but on the whole, little of a\nserious nature, nothing special to note, unless it be a great deal of\nscrofula, due, no doubt, to the deplorable hygienic conditions of our\npeasant dwellings. Ah! you will find many prejudices to combat, Monsieur\nBovary, much obstinacy of routine, with which all the efforts of your\nscience will daily come into collision; for people still have recourse\nto novenas, to relics, to the priest, rather than come straight to the\ndoctor or the chemist. The climate, however, is not, truth to tell, bad,\nand we even have a few nonagenarians in our parish. The thermometer (I\nhave made some observations) falls in winter to 4 degrees Centigrade\nat the outside, which gives us 24 degrees Reaumur as the maximum, or\notherwise 54 degrees Fahrenheit (English scale), not more. And, as a\nmatter of fact, we are sheltered from the north winds by the forest of\nArgueil on the one side, from the west winds by the St. Jean range on\nthe other; and this heat, moreover, which, on account of the aqueous\nvapours given off by the river and the considerable number of cattle\nin the fields, which, as you know, exhale much ammonia, that is to say,\nnitrogen, hydrogen and oxygen (no, nitrogen and hydrogen alone), and\nwhich sucking up into itself the humus from the ground, mixing together\nall those different emanations, unites them into a stack, so to say,\nand combining with the electricity diffused through the atmosphere, when\nthere is any, might in the long run, as in tropical countries, engender\ninsalubrious miasmata--this heat, I say, finds itself perfectly tempered\non the side whence it comes, or rather whence it should come--that is to\nsay, the southern side--by the south-eastern winds, which, having cooled\nthemselves passing over the Seine, reach us sometimes all at once like\nbreezes from Russia.\"\n\n\"At any rate, you have some walks in the neighbourhood?\" continued\nMadame Bovary, speaking to the young man.\n\n\"Oh, very few,\" he answered. \"There is a place they call La Pature, on\nthe top of the hill, on the edge of the forest. Sometimes, on Sundays, I\ngo and stay there with a book, watching the sunset.\"\n\n\"I think there is nothing so admirable as sunsets,\" she resumed; \"but\nespecially by the side of the sea.\"\n\n\"Oh, I adore the sea!\" said Monsieur Leon.\n\n\"And then, does it not seem to you,\" continued Madame Bovary, \"that the\nmind travels more freely on this limitless expanse, the contemplation of\nwhich elevates the soul, gives ideas of the infinite, the ideal?\"\n\n\"It is the same with mountainous landscapes,\" continued Leon. \"A cousin\nof mine who travelled in Switzerland last year told me that one could\nnot picture to oneself the poetry of the lakes, the charm of the\nwaterfalls, the gigantic effect of the glaciers. One sees pines of\nincredible size across torrents, cottages suspended over precipices,\nand, a thousand feet below one, whole valleys when the clouds open. Such\nspectacles must stir to enthusiasm, incline to prayer, to ecstasy; and I\nno longer marvel at that celebrated musician who, the better to inspire\nhis imagination, was in the habit of playing the piano before some\nimposing site.\"\n\n\"You play?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, but I am very fond of music,\" he replied.\n\n\"Ah! don't you listen to him, Madame Bovary,\" interrupted Homais,\nbending over his plate. \"That's sheer modesty. Why, my dear fellow, the\nother day in your room you were singing 'L'Ange Gardien' ravishingly. I\nheard you from the laboratory. You gave it like an actor.\"\n\nLeon, in fact, lodged at the chemist's where he had a small room on the\nsecond floor, overlooking the Place. He blushed at the compliment of his\nlandlord, who had already turned to the doctor, and was enumerating to\nhim, one after the other, all the principal inhabitants of Yonville. He\nwas telling anecdotes, giving information; the fortune of the notary\nwas not known exactly, and \"there was the Tuvache household,\" who made a\ngood deal of show.\n\nEmma continued, \"And what music do you prefer?\"\n\n\"Oh, German music; that which makes you dream.\"\n\n\"Have you been to the opera?\"\n\n\"Not yet; but I shall go next year, when I am living at Paris to finish\nreading for the bar.\"\n\n\"As I had the honour of putting it to your husband,\" said the chemist,\n\"with regard to this poor Yanoda who has run away, you will find\nyourself, thanks to his extravagance, in the possession of one of the\nmost comfortable houses of Yonville. Its greatest convenience for a\ndoctor is a door giving on the Walk, where one can go in and out unseen.\nMoreover, it contains everything that is agreeable in a household--a\nlaundry, kitchen with offices, sitting-room, fruit-room, and so on. He\nwas a gay dog, who didn't care what he spent. At the end of the garden,\nby the side of the water, he had an arbour built just for the purpose of\ndrinking beer in summer; and if madame is fond of gardening she will be\nable--\"\n\n\"My wife doesn't care about it,\" said Charles; \"although she has\nbeen advised to take exercise, she prefers always sitting in her room\nreading.\"\n\n\"Like me,\" replied Leon. \"And indeed, what is better than to sit by\none's fireside in the evening with a book, while the wind beats against\nthe window and the lamp is burning?\"\n\n\"What, indeed?\" she said, fixing her large black eyes wide open upon\nhim.\n\n\"One thinks of nothing,\" he continued; \"the hours slip by. Motionless we\ntraverse countries we fancy we see, and your thought, blending with\nthe fiction, playing with the details, follows the outline of the\nadventures. It mingles with the characters, and it seems as if it were\nyourself palpitating beneath their costumes.\"\n\n\"That is true! That is true?\" she said.\n\n\"Has it ever happened to you,\" Leon went on, \"to come across some vague\nidea of one's own in a book, some dim image that comes back to you from\nafar, and as the completest expression of your own slightest sentiment?\"\n\n\"I have experienced it,\" she replied.\n\n\"That is why,\" he said, \"I especially love the poets. I think verse more\ntender than prose, and that it moves far more easily to tears.\"\n\n\"Still in the long run it is tiring,\" continued Emma. \"Now I, on the\ncontrary, adore stories that rush breathlessly along, that frighten one.\nI detest commonplace heroes and moderate sentiments, such as there are\nin nature.\"\n\n\"In fact,\" observed the clerk, \"these works, not touching the heart,\nmiss, it seems to me, the true end of art. It is so sweet, amid all\nthe disenchantments of life, to be able to dwell in thought upon noble\ncharacters, pure affections, and pictures of happiness. For myself,\nliving here far from the world, this is my one distraction; but Yonville\naffords so few resources.\"\n\n\"Like Tostes, no doubt,\" replied Emma; \"and so I always subscribed to a\nlending library.\"\n\n\"If madame will do me the honour of making use of it\", said the chemist,\nwho had just caught the last words, \"I have at her disposal a library\ncomposed of the best authors, Voltaire, Rousseau, Delille, Walter\nScott, the 'Echo des Feuilletons'; and in addition I receive various\nperiodicals, among them the 'Fanal de Rouen' daily, having the advantage\nto be its correspondent for the districts of Buchy, Forges, Neufchatel,\nYonville, and vicinity.\"\n\nFor two hours and a half they had been at table; for the servant\nArtemis, carelessly dragging her old list slippers over the flags,\nbrought one plate after the other, forgot everything, and constantly\nleft the door of the billiard-room half open, so that it beat against\nthe wall with its hooks.\n\nUnconsciously, Leon, while talking, had placed his foot on one of the\nbars of the chair on which Madame Bovary was sitting. She wore a small\nblue silk necktie, that kept up like a ruff a gauffered cambric collar,\nand with the movements of her head the lower part of her face gently\nsunk into the linen or came out from it. Thus side by side, while\nCharles and the chemist chatted, they entered into one of those vague\nconversations where the hazard of all that is said brings you back to\nthe fixed centre of a common sympathy. The Paris theatres, titles of\nnovels, new quadrilles, and the world they did not know; Tostes, where\nshe had lived, and Yonville, where they were; they examined all, talked\nof everything till to the end of dinner.\n\nWhen coffee was served Felicite went away to get ready the room in the\nnew house, and the guests soon raised the siege. Madame Lefrancois was\nasleep near the cinders, while the stable-boy, lantern in hand, was\nwaiting to show Monsieur and Madame Bovary the way home. Bits of straw\nstuck in his red hair, and he limped with his left leg. When he had\ntaken in his other hand the cure's umbrella, they started.\n\nThe town was asleep; the pillars of the market threw great shadows; the\nearth was all grey as on a summer's night. But as the doctor's house was\nonly some fifty paces from the inn, they had to say good-night almost\nimmediately, and the company dispersed.\n\nAs soon as she entered the passage, Emma felt the cold of the plaster\nfall about her shoulders like damp linen. The walls were new and the\nwooden stairs creaked. In their bedroom, on the first floor, a whitish\nlight passed through the curtainless windows.\n\nShe could catch glimpses of tree tops, and beyond, the fields,\nhalf-drowned in the fog that lay reeking in the moonlight along\nthe course of the river. In the middle of the room, pell-mell, were\nscattered drawers, bottles, curtain-rods, gilt poles, with mattresses\non the chairs and basins on the ground--the two men who had brought the\nfurniture had left everything about carelessly.\n\nThis was the fourth time that she had slept in a strange place.\n\nThe first was the day of her going to the convent; the second, of her\narrival at Tostes; the third, at Vaubyessard; and this was the fourth.\nAnd each one had marked, as it were, the inauguration of a new phase in\nher life. She did not believe that things could present themselves in\nthe same way in different places, and since the portion of her life\nlived had been bad, no doubt that which remained to be lived would be\nbetter.\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n\nThe next day, as she was getting up, she saw the clerk on the Place. She\nhad on a dressing-gown. He looked up and bowed. She nodded quickly and\nreclosed the window.\n\nLeon waited all day for six o'clock in the evening to come, but on going\nto the inn, he found no one but Monsieur Binet, already at table. The\ndinner of the evening before had been a considerable event for him; he\nhad never till then talked for two hours consecutively to a \"lady.\" How\nthen had he been able to explain, and in such language, the number of\nthings that he could not have said so well before? He was usually\nshy, and maintained that reserve which partakes at once of modesty and\ndissimulation.\n\nAt Yonville he was considered \"well-bred.\" He listened to the arguments\nof the older people, and did not seem hot about politics--a remarkable\nthing for a young man. Then he had some accomplishments; he painted in\nwater-colours, could read the key of G, and readily talked literature\nafter dinner when he did not play cards. Monsieur Homais respected him\nfor his education; Madame Homais liked him for his good-nature, for\nhe often took the little Homais into the garden--little brats who were\nalways dirty, very much spoilt, and somewhat lymphatic, like their\nmother. Besides the servant to look after them, they had Justin, the\nchemist's apprentice, a second cousin of Monsieur Homais, who had been\ntaken into the house from charity, and who was useful at the same time\nas a servant.\n\nThe druggist proved the best of neighbours. He gave Madame Bovary\ninformation as to the trades-people, sent expressly for his own cider\nmerchant, tasted the drink himself, and saw that the casks were properly\nplaced in the cellar; he explained how to set about getting in a\nsupply of butter cheap, and made an arrangement with Lestiboudois, the\nsacristan, who, besides his sacerdotal and funeral functions, looked\nafter the principal gardens at Yonville by the hour or the year,\naccording to the taste of the customers.\n\nThe need of looking after others was not the only thing that urged the\nchemist to such obsequious cordiality; there was a plan underneath it\nall.\n\nHe had infringed the law of the 19th Ventose, year xi., article I, which\nforbade all persons not having a diploma to practise medicine; so that,\nafter certain anonymous denunciations, Homais had been summoned to Rouen\nto see the procurer of the king in his own private room; the magistrate\nreceiving him standing up, ermine on shoulder and cap on head. It was\nin the morning, before the court opened. In the corridors one heard\nthe heavy boots of the gendarmes walking past, and like a far-off noise\ngreat locks that were shut. The druggist's ears tingled as if he were\nabout to have an apoplectic stroke; he saw the depths of dungeons,\nhis family in tears, his shop sold, all the jars dispersed; and he was\nobliged to enter a cafe and take a glass of rum and seltzer to recover\nhis spirits.\n\nLittle by little the memory of this reprimand grew fainter, and\nhe continued, as heretofore, to give anodyne consultations in his\nback-parlour. But the mayor resented it, his colleagues were jealous,\neverything was to be feared; gaining over Monsieur Bovary by his\nattentions was to earn his gratitude, and prevent his speaking out later\non, should he notice anything. So every morning Homais brought him \"the\npaper,\" and often in the afternoon left his shop for a few moments to\nhave a chat with the Doctor.\n\nCharles was dull: patients did not come. He remained seated for hours\nwithout speaking, went into his consulting room to sleep, or watched\nhis wife sewing. Then for diversion he employed himself at home as a\nworkman; he even tried to do up the attic with some paint which had been\nleft behind by the painters. But money matters worried him. He had\nspent so much for repairs at Tostes, for madame's toilette, and for the\nmoving, that the whole dowry, over three thousand crowns, had slipped\naway in two years.\n\nThen how many things had been spoilt or lost during their carriage from\nTostes to Yonville, without counting the plaster cure, who falling out\nof the coach at an over-severe jolt, had been dashed into a thousand\nfragments on the pavements of Quincampoix! A pleasanter trouble came\nto distract him, namely, the pregnancy of his wife. As the time of her\nconfinement approached he cherished her the more. It was another bond of\nthe flesh establishing itself, and, as it were, a continued sentiment\nof a more complex union. When from afar he saw her languid walk, and\nher figure without stays turning softly on her hips; when opposite one\nanother he looked at her at his ease, while she took tired poses in her\narmchair, then his happiness knew no bounds; he got up, embraced her,\npassed his hands over her face, called her little mamma, wanted to\nmake her dance, and half-laughing, half-crying, uttered all kinds of\ncaressing pleasantries that came into his head. The idea of having\nbegotten a child delighted him. Now he wanted nothing. He knew human\nlife from end to end, and he sat down to it with serenity.\n\nEmma at first felt a great astonishment; then was anxious to be\ndelivered that she might know what it was to be a mother. But not\nbeing able to spend as much as she would have liked, to have a\nswing-bassinette with rose silk curtains, and embroidered caps, in a fit\nof bitterness she gave up looking after the trousseau, and ordered the\nwhole of it from a village needlewoman, without choosing or discussing\nanything. Thus she did not amuse herself with those preparations that\nstimulate the tenderness of mothers, and so her affection was from the\nvery outset, perhaps, to some extent attenuated.\n\nAs Charles, however, spoke of the boy at every meal, she soon began to\nthink of him more consecutively.\n\nShe hoped for a son; he would be strong and dark; she would call him\nGeorge; and this idea of having a male child was like an expected\nrevenge for all her impotence in the past. A man, at least, is free; he\nmay travel over passions and over countries, overcome obstacles, taste\nof the most far-away pleasures. But a woman is always hampered. At once\ninert and flexible, she has against her the weakness of the flesh and\nlegal dependence. Her will, like the veil of her bonnet, held by a\nstring, flutters in every wind; there is always some desire that draws\nher, some conventionality that restrains.\n\nShe was confined on a Sunday at about six o'clock, as the sun was\nrising.\n\n\"It is a girl!\" said Charles.\n\nShe turned her head away and fainted.\n\nMadame Homais, as well as Madame Lefrancois of the Lion d'Or, almost\nimmediately came running in to embrace her. The chemist, as man of\ndiscretion, only offered a few provincial felicitations through the\nhalf-opened door. He wished to see the child and thought it well made.\n\nWhilst she was getting well she occupied herself much in seeking a\nname for her daughter. First she went over all those that have Italian\nendings, such as Clara, Louisa, Amanda, Atala; she liked Galsuinde\npretty well, and Yseult or Leocadie still better.\n\nCharles wanted the child to be called after her mother; Emma opposed\nthis. They ran over the calendar from end to end, and then consulted\noutsiders.\n\n\"Monsieur Leon,\" said the chemist, \"with whom I was talking about it\nthe other day, wonders you do not chose Madeleine. It is very much in\nfashion just now.\"\n\nBut Madame Bovary, senior, cried out loudly against this name of a\nsinner. As to Monsieur Homais, he had a preference for all those that\nrecalled some great man, an illustrious fact, or a generous idea, and it\nwas on this system that he had baptized his four children. Thus Napoleon\nrepresented glory and Franklin liberty; Irma was perhaps a concession to\nromanticism, but Athalie was a homage to the greatest masterpiece of the\nFrench stage. For his philosophical convictions did not interfere\nwith his artistic tastes; in him the thinker did not stifle the man of\nsentiment; he could make distinctions, make allowances for imagination\nand fanaticism. In this tragedy, for example, he found fault with the\nideas, but admired the style; he detested the conception, but applauded\nall the details, and loathed the characters while he grew enthusiastic\nover their dialogue. When he read the fine passages he was transported,\nbut when he thought that mummers would get something out of them for\ntheir show, he was disconsolate; and in this confusion of sentiments in\nwhich he was involved he would have liked at once to crown Racine with\nboth his hands and discuss with him for a good quarter of an hour.\n\nAt last Emma remembered that at the chateau of Vaubyessard she had heard\nthe Marchioness call a young lady Berthe; from that moment this name was\nchosen; and as old Rouault could not come, Monsieur Homais was requested\nto stand godfather. His gifts were all products from his establishment,\nto wit: six boxes of jujubes, a whole jar of racahout, three cakes of\nmarshmallow paste, and six sticks of sugar-candy into the bargain that\nhe had come across in a cupboard. On the evening of the ceremony there\nwas a grand dinner; the cure was present; there was much excitement.\nMonsieur Homais towards liqueur-time began singing \"Le Dieu des bonnes\ngens.\" Monsieur Leon sang a barcarolle, and Madame Bovary, senior, who\nwas godmother, a romance of the time of the Empire; finally, M. Bovary,\nsenior, insisted on having the child brought down, and began baptizing\nit with a glass of champagne that he poured over its head. This mockery\nof the first of the sacraments made the Abbe Bournisien angry; old\nBovary replied by a quotation from \"La Guerre des Dieux\"; the cure\nwanted to leave; the ladies implored, Homais interfered; and they\nsucceeded in making the priest sit down again, and he quietly went on\nwith the half-finished coffee in his saucer.\n\nMonsieur Bovary, senior, stayed at Yonville a month, dazzling the\nnatives by a superb policeman's cap with silver tassels that he wore\nin the morning when he smoked his pipe in the square. Being also in the\nhabit of drinking a good deal of brandy, he often sent the servant\nto the Lion d'Or to buy him a bottle, which was put down to his\nson's account, and to perfume his handkerchiefs he used up his\ndaughter-in-law's whole supply of eau-de-cologne.\n\nThe latter did not at all dislike his company. He had knocked about the\nworld, he talked about Berlin, Vienna, and Strasbourg, of his soldier\ntimes, of the mistresses he had had, the grand luncheons of which he had\npartaken; then he was amiable, and sometimes even, either on the stairs,\nor in the garden, would seize hold of her waist, crying, \"Charles, look\nout for yourself.\"\n\nThen Madame Bovary, senior, became alarmed for her son's happiness, and\nfearing that her husband might in the long-run have an immoral influence\nupon the ideas of the young woman, took care to hurry their departure.\nPerhaps she had more serious reasons for uneasiness. Monsieur Bovary was\nnot the man to respect anything.\n\nOne day Emma was suddenly seized with the desire to see her little\ngirl, who had been put to nurse with the carpenter's wife, and, without\nlooking at the calendar to see whether the six weeks of the Virgin were\nyet passed, she set out for the Rollets' house, situated at the extreme\nend of the village, between the highroad and the fields.\n\nIt was mid-day, the shutters of the houses were closed and the slate\nroofs that glittered beneath the fierce light of the blue sky seemed to\nstrike sparks from the crest of the gables. A heavy wind was blowing;\nEmma felt weak as she walked; the stones of the pavement hurt her; she\nwas doubtful whether she would not go home again, or go in somewhere to\nrest.\n\nAt this moment Monsieur Leon came out from a neighbouring door with a\nbundle of papers under his arm. He came to greet her, and stood in the\nshade in front of the Lheureux's shop under the projecting grey awning.\n\nMadame Bovary said she was going to see her baby, but that she was\nbeginning to grow tired.\n\n\"If--\" said Leon, not daring to go on.\n\n\"Have you any business to attend to?\" she asked.\n\nAnd on the clerk's answer, she begged him to accompany her. That same\nevening this was known in Yonville, and Madame Tuvache, the mayor's\nwife, declared in the presence of her servant that \"Madame Bovary was\ncompromising herself.\"\n\nTo get to the nurse's it was necessary to turn to the left on leaving\nthe street, as if making for the cemetery, and to follow between little\nhouses and yards a small path bordered with privet hedges. They were\nin bloom, and so were the speedwells, eglantines, thistles, and the\nsweetbriar that sprang up from the thickets. Through openings in\nthe hedges one could see into the huts, some pigs on a dung-heap, or\ntethered cows rubbing their horns against the trunk of trees. The two,\nside by side walked slowly, she leaning upon him, and he restraining\nhis pace, which he regulated by hers; in front of them a swarm of midges\nfluttered, buzzing in the warm air.\n\nThey recognized the house by an old walnut-tree which shaded it.\n\nLow and covered with brown tiles, there hung outside it, beneath the\ndormer-window of the garret, a string of onions. Faggots upright\nagainst a thorn fence surrounded a bed of lettuce, a few square feet of\nlavender, and sweet peas strung on sticks. Dirty water was running here\nand there on the grass, and all round were several indefinite rags,\nknitted stockings, a red calico jacket, and a large sheet of coarse\nlinen spread over the hedge. At the noise of the gate the nurse appeared\nwith a baby she was suckling on one arm. With her other hand she was\npulling along a poor puny little fellow, his face covered with scrofula,\nthe son of a Rouen hosier, whom his parents, too taken up with their\nbusiness, left in the country.\n\n\"Go in,\" she said; \"your little one is there asleep.\"\n\nThe room on the ground-floor, the only one in the dwelling, had at its\nfarther end, against the wall, a large bed without curtains, while a\nkneading-trough took up the side by the window, one pane of which\nwas mended with a piece of blue paper. In the corner behind the door,\nshining hob-nailed shoes stood in a row under the slab of the washstand,\nnear a bottle of oil with a feather stuck in its mouth; a Matthieu\nLaensberg lay on the dusty mantelpiece amid gunflints, candle-ends, and\nbits of amadou.\n\nFinally, the last luxury in the apartment was a \"Fame\" blowing her\ntrumpets, a picture cut out, no doubt, from some perfumer's prospectus\nand nailed to the wall with six wooden shoe-pegs.\n\nEmma's child was asleep in a wicker-cradle. She took it up in the\nwrapping that enveloped it and began singing softly as she rocked\nherself to and fro.\n\nLeon walked up and down the room; it seemed strange to him to see this\nbeautiful woman in her nankeen dress in the midst of all this poverty.\nMadam Bovary reddened; he turned away, thinking perhaps there had been\nan impertinent look in his eyes. Then she put back the little girl, who\nhad just been sick over her collar.\n\nThe nurse at once came to dry her, protesting that it wouldn't show.\n\n\"She gives me other doses,\" she said: \"I am always a-washing of her. If\nyou would have the goodness to order Camus, the grocer, to let me have\na little soap, it would really be more convenient for you, as I needn't\ntrouble you then.\"\n\n\"Very well! very well!\" said Emma. \"Good morning, Madame Rollet,\" and\nshe went out, wiping her shoes at the door.\n\nThe good woman accompanied her to the end of the garden, talking all the\ntime of the trouble she had getting up of nights.\n\n\"I'm that worn out sometimes as I drop asleep on my chair. I'm sure you\nmight at least give me just a pound of ground coffee; that'd last me a\nmonth, and I'd take it of a morning with some milk.\"\n\nAfter having submitted to her thanks, Madam Bovary left. She had gone a\nlittle way down the path when, at the sound of wooden shoes, she turned\nround. It was the nurse.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nThen the peasant woman, taking her aside behind an elm tree, began\ntalking to her of her husband, who with his trade and six francs a year\nthat the captain--\n\n\"Oh, be quick!\" said Emma.\n\n\"Well,\" the nurse went on, heaving sighs between each word, \"I'm afraid\nhe'll be put out seeing me have coffee alone, you know men--\"\n\n\"But you are to have some,\" Emma repeated; \"I will give you some. You\nbother me!\"\n\n\"Oh, dear! my poor, dear lady! you see in consequence of his wounds he\nhas terrible cramps in the chest. He even says that cider weakens him.\"\n\n\"Do make haste, Mere Rollet!\"\n\n\"Well,\" the latter continued, making a curtsey, \"if it weren't asking\ntoo much,\" and she curtsied once more, \"if you would\"--and her eyes\nbegged--\"a jar of brandy,\" she said at last, \"and I'd rub your little\none's feet with it; they're as tender as one's tongue.\"\n\nOnce rid of the nurse, Emma again took Monsieur Leon's arm. She walked\nfast for some time, then more slowly, and looking straight in front of\nher, her eyes rested on the shoulder of the young man, whose frock-coat\nhad a black-velvety collar. His brown hair fell over it, straight and\ncarefully arranged. She noticed his nails which were longer than one\nwore them at Yonville. It was one of the clerk's chief occupations to\ntrim them, and for this purpose he kept a special knife in his writing\ndesk.\n\nThey returned to Yonville by the water-side. In the warm season the\nbank, wider than at other times, showed to their foot the garden walls\nwhence a few steps led to the river. It flowed noiselessly, swift,\nand cold to the eye; long, thin grasses huddled together in it as the\ncurrent drove them, and spread themselves upon the limpid water like\nstreaming hair; sometimes at the tip of the reeds or on the leaf of a\nwater-lily an insect with fine legs crawled or rested. The sun pierced\nwith a ray the small blue bubbles of the waves that, breaking, followed\neach other; branchless old willows mirrored their grey backs in\nthe water; beyond, all around, the meadows seemed empty. It was the\ndinner-hour at the farms, and the young woman and her companion heard\nnothing as they walked but the fall of their steps on the earth of the\npath, the words they spoke, and the sound of Emma's dress rustling round\nher.\n\nThe walls of the gardens with pieces of bottle on their coping were\nhot as the glass windows of a conservatory. Wallflowers had sprung up\nbetween the bricks, and with the tip of her open sunshade Madame Bovary,\nas she passed, made some of their faded flowers crumble into a yellow\ndust, or a spray of overhanging honeysuckle and clematis caught in its\nfringe and dangled for a moment over the silk.\n\nThey were talking of a troupe of Spanish dancers who were expected\nshortly at the Rouen theatre.\n\n\"Are you going?\" she asked.\n\n\"If I can,\" he answered.\n\nHad they nothing else to say to one another? Yet their eyes were full\nof more serious speech, and while they forced themselves to find trivial\nphrases, they felt the same languor stealing over them both. It was the\nwhisper of the soul, deep, continuous, dominating that of their voices.\nSurprised with wonder at this strange sweetness, they did not think of\nspeaking of the sensation or of seeking its cause. Coming joys, like\ntropical shores, throw over the immensity before them their inborn\nsoftness, an odorous wind, and we are lulled by this intoxication\nwithout a thought of the horizon that we do not even know.\n\nIn one place the ground had been trodden down by the cattle; they had to\nstep on large green stones put here and there in the mud.\n\nShe often stopped a moment to look where to place her foot, and\ntottering on a stone that shook, her arms outspread, her form bent\nforward with a look of indecision, she would laugh, afraid of falling\ninto the puddles of water.\n\nWhen they arrived in front of her garden, Madame Bovary opened the\nlittle gate, ran up the steps and disappeared.\n\nLeon returned to his office. His chief was away; he just glanced at the\nbriefs, then cut himself a pen, and at last took up his hat and went\nout.\n\nHe went to La Pature at the top of the Argueil hills at the beginning of\nthe forest; he threw himself upon the ground under the pines and watched\nthe sky through his fingers.\n\n\"How bored I am!\" he said to himself, \"how bored I am!\"\n\nHe thought he was to be pitied for living in this village, with Homais\nfor a friend and Monsieru Guillaumin for master. The latter, entirely\nabsorbed by his business, wearing gold-rimmed spectacles and red\nwhiskers over a white cravat, understood nothing of mental refinements,\nalthough he affected a stiff English manner, which in the beginning had\nimpressed the clerk.\n\nAs to the chemist's spouse, she was the best wife in Normandy, gentle\nas a sheep, loving her children, her father, her mother, her cousins,\nweeping for other's woes, letting everything go in her household, and\ndetesting corsets; but so slow of movement, such a bore to listen to, so\ncommon in appearance, and of such restricted conversation, that although\nshe was thirty, he only twenty, although they slept in rooms next each\nother and he spoke to her daily, he never thought that she might be a\nwoman for another, or that she possessed anything else of her sex than\nthe gown.\n\nAnd what else was there? Binet, a few shopkeepers, two or three\npublicans, the cure, and finally, Monsieur Tuvache, the mayor, with his\ntwo sons, rich, crabbed, obtuse persons, who farmed their own lands\nand had feasts among themselves, bigoted to boot, and quite unbearable\ncompanions.\n\nBut from the general background of all these human faces Emma's stood\nout isolated and yet farthest off; for between her and him he seemed to\nsee a vague abyss.\n\nIn the beginning he had called on her several times along with the\ndruggist. Charles had not appeared particularly anxious to see him\nagain, and Leon did not know what to do between his fear of being\nindiscreet and the desire for an intimacy that seemed almost impossible.\n\n\n\nChapter Four\n\nWhen the first cold days set in Emma left her bedroom for the\nsitting-room, a long apartment with a low ceiling, in which there was\non the mantelpiece a large bunch of coral spread out against the\nlooking-glass. Seated in her arm chair near the window, she could see\nthe villagers pass along the pavement.\n\nTwice a day Leon went from his office to the Lion d'Or. Emma could hear\nhim coming from afar; she leant forward listening, and the young man\nglided past the curtain, always dressed in the same way, and without\nturning his head. But in the twilight, when, her chin resting on her\nleft hand, she let the embroidery she had begun fall on her knees, she\noften shuddered at the apparition of this shadow suddenly gliding past.\nShe would get up and order the table to be laid.\n\nMonsieur Homais called at dinner-time. Skull-cap in hand, he came in on\ntiptoe, in order to disturb no one, always repeating the same phrase,\n\"Good evening, everybody.\" Then, when he had taken his seat at the table\nbetween the pair, he asked the doctor about his patients, and the latter\nconsulted his as to the probability of their payment. Next they talked\nof \"what was in the paper.\"\n\nHomais by this hour knew it almost by heart, and he repeated it from end\nto end, with the reflections of the penny-a-liners, and all the stories\nof individual catastrophes that had occurred in France or abroad. But\nthe subject becoming exhausted, he was not slow in throwing out some\nremarks on the dishes before him.\n\nSometimes even, half-rising, he delicately pointed out to madame the\ntenderest morsel, or turning to the servant, gave her some advice on the\nmanipulation of stews and the hygiene of seasoning.\n\nHe talked aroma, osmazome, juices, and gelatine in a bewildering manner.\nMoreover, Homais, with his head fuller of recipes than his shop of jars,\nexcelled in making all kinds of preserves, vinegars, and sweet liqueurs;\nhe knew also all the latest inventions in economic stoves, together with\nthe art of preserving cheese and of curing sick wines.\n\nAt eight o'clock Justin came to fetch him to shut up the shop.\n\nThen Monsieur Homais gave him a sly look, especially if Felicite was\nthere, for he half noticed that his apprentice was fond of the doctor's\nhouse.\n\n\"The young dog,\" he said, \"is beginning to have ideas, and the devil\ntake me if I don't believe he's in love with your servant!\"\n\nBut a more serious fault with which he reproached Justin was his\nconstantly listening to conversation. On Sunday, for example, one could\nnot get him out of the drawing-room, whither Madame Homais had called\nhim to fetch the children, who were falling asleep in the arm-chairs,\nand dragging down with their backs calico chair-covers that were too\nlarge.\n\nNot many people came to these soirees at the chemist's, his\nscandal-mongering and political opinions having successfully alienated\nvarious respectable persons from him. The clerk never failed to be\nthere. As soon as he heard the bell he ran to meet Madame Bovary, took\nher shawl, and put away under the shop-counter the thick list shoes that\nshe wore over her boots when there was snow.\n\nFirst they played some hands at trente-et-un; next Monsieur Homais\nplayed ecarte with Emma; Leon behind her gave her advice.\n\nStanding up with his hands on the back of her chair he saw the teeth of\nher comb that bit into her chignon. With every movement that she made\nto throw her cards the right side of her dress was drawn up. From her\nturned-up hair a dark colour fell over her back, and growing gradually\npaler, lost itself little by little in the shade. Then her dress fell\non both sides of her chair, puffing out full of folds, and reached the\nground. When Leon occasionally felt the sole of his boot resting on it,\nhe drew back as if he had trodden upon some one.\n\nWhen the game of cards was over, the druggist and the Doctor played\ndominoes, and Emma, changing her place, leant her elbow on the table,\nturning over the leaves of \"L'Illustration\". She had brought her ladies'\njournal with her. Leon sat down near her; they looked at the engravings\ntogether, and waited for one another at the bottom of the pages. She\noften begged him to read her the verses; Leon declaimed them in a\nlanguid voice, to which he carefully gave a dying fall in the love\npassages. But the noise of the dominoes annoyed him. Monsieur Homais\nwas strong at the game; he could beat Charles and give him a double-six.\nThen the three hundred finished, they both stretched themselves out in\nfront of the fire, and were soon asleep. The fire was dying out in the\ncinders; the teapot was empty, Leon was still reading.\n\nEmma listened to him, mechanically turning around the lampshade, on the\ngauze of which were painted clowns in carriages, and tight-rope dances\nwith their balancing-poles. Leon stopped, pointing with a gesture to his\nsleeping audience; then they talked in low tones, and their conversation\nseemed the more sweet to them because it was unheard.\n\nThus a kind of bond was established between them, a constant commerce\nof books and of romances. Monsieur Bovary, little given to jealousy, did\nnot trouble himself about it.\n\nOn his birthday he received a beautiful phrenological head, all marked\nwith figures to the thorax and painted blue. This was an attention of\nthe clerk's. He showed him many others, even to doing errands for him\nat Rouen; and the book of a novelist having made the mania for cactuses\nfashionable, Leon bought some for Madame Bovary, bringing them back on\nhis knees in the \"Hirondelle,\" pricking his fingers on their hard hairs.\n\nShe had a board with a balustrade fixed against her window to hold the\npots. The clerk, too, had his small hanging garden; they saw each other\ntending their flowers at their windows.\n\nOf the windows of the village there was one yet more often occupied; for\non Sundays from morning to night, and every morning when the weather was\nbright, one could see at the dormer-window of the garret the profile of\nMonsieur Binet bending over his lathe, whose monotonous humming could be\nheard at the Lion d'Or.\n\nOne evening on coming home Leon found in his room a rug in velvet and\nwool with leaves on a pale ground. He called Madame Homais, Monsieur\nHomais, Justin, the children, the cook; he spoke of it to his chief;\nevery one wanted to see this rug. Why did the doctor's wife give the\nclerk presents? It looked queer. They decided that she must be his\nlover.\n\nHe made this seem likely, so ceaselessly did he talk of her charms and\nof her wit; so much so, that Binet once roughly answered him--\n\n\"What does it matter to me since I'm not in her set?\"\n\nHe tortured himself to find out how he could make his declaration to\nher, and always halting between the fear of displeasing her and the\nshame of being such a coward, he wept with discouragement and desire.\nThen he took energetic resolutions, wrote letters that he tore up, put\nit off to times that he again deferred.\n\nOften he set out with the determination to dare all; but this resolution\nsoon deserted him in Emma's presence, and when Charles, dropping in,\ninvited him to jump into his chaise to go with him to see some patient\nin the neighbourhood, he at once accepted, bowed to madame, and went\nout. Her husband, was he not something belonging to her? As to Emma,\nshe did not ask herself whether she loved. Love, she thought, must come\nsuddenly, with great outbursts and lightnings--a hurricane of the skies,\nwhich falls upon life, revolutionises it, roots up the will like a leaf,\nand sweeps the whole heart into the abyss. She did not know that on\nthe terrace of houses it makes lakes when the pipes are choked, and she\nwould thus have remained in her security when she suddenly discovered a\nrent in the wall of it.\n\n\n\nChapter Five\n\nIt was a Sunday in February, an afternoon when the snow was falling.\n\nThey had all, Monsieur and Madame Bovary, Homais, and Monsieur Leon,\ngone to see a yarn-mill that was being built in the valley a mile and a\nhalf from Yonville. The druggist had taken Napoleon and Athalie to give\nthem some exercise, and Justin accompanied them, carrying the umbrellas\non his shoulder.\n\nNothing, however, could be less curious than this curiosity. A great\npiece of waste ground, on which pell-mell, amid a mass of sand and\nstones, were a few break-wheels, already rusty, surrounded by a\nquadrangular building pierced by a number of little windows. The\nbuilding was unfinished; the sky could be seen through the joists of the\nroofing. Attached to the stop-plank of the gable a bunch of straw mixed\nwith corn-ears fluttered its tricoloured ribbons in the wind.\n\nHomais was talking. He explained to the company the future importance\nof this establishment, computed the strength of the floorings, the\nthickness of the walls, and regretted extremely not having a yard-stick\nsuch as Monsieur Binet possessed for his own special use.\n\nEmma, who had taken his arm, bent lightly against his shoulder, and\nshe looked at the sun's disc shedding afar through the mist his pale\nsplendour. She turned. Charles was there. His cap was drawn down over\nhis eyebrows, and his two thick lips were trembling, which added a look\nof stupidity to his face; his very back, his calm back, was irritating\nto behold, and she saw written upon his coat all the platitude of the\nbearer.\n\nWhile she was considering him thus, tasting in her irritation a sort of\ndepraved pleasure, Leon made a step forward. The cold that made him pale\nseemed to add a more gentle languor to his face; between his cravat and\nhis neck the somewhat loose collar of his shirt showed the skin; the\nlobe of his ear looked out from beneath a lock of hair, and his large\nblue eyes, raised to the clouds, seemed to Emma more limpid and more\nbeautiful than those mountain-lakes where the heavens are mirrored.\n\n\"Wretched boy!\" suddenly cried the chemist.\n\nAnd he ran to his son, who had just precipitated himself into a heap of\nlime in order to whiten his boots. At the reproaches with which he was\nbeing overwhelmed Napoleon began to roar, while Justin dried his shoes\nwith a wisp of straw. But a knife was wanted; Charles offered his.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said to herself, \"he carried a knife in his pocket like a\npeasant.\"\n\nThe hoar-frost was falling, and they turned back to Yonville.\n\nIn the evening Madame Bovary did not go to her neighbour's, and when\nCharles had left and she felt herself alone, the comparison re-began\nwith the clearness of a sensation almost actual, and with that\nlengthening of perspective which memory gives to things. Looking from\nher bed at the clean fire that was burning, she still saw, as she had\ndown there, Leon standing up with one hand behind his cane, and with\nthe other holding Athalie, who was quietly sucking a piece of ice. She\nthought him charming; she could not tear herself away from him; she\nrecalled his other attitudes on other days, the words he had spoken, the\nsound of his voice, his whole person; and she repeated, pouting out her\nlips as if for a kiss--\n\n\"Yes, charming! charming! Is he not in love?\" she asked herself; \"but\nwith whom? With me?\"\n\nAll the proofs arose before her at once; her heart leapt. The flame of\nthe fire threw a joyous light upon the ceiling; she turned on her back,\nstretching out her arms.\n\nThen began the eternal lamentation: \"Oh, if Heaven had not willed it!\nAnd why not? What prevented it?\"\n\nWhen Charles came home at midnight, she seemed to have just awakened,\nand as he made a noise undressing, she complained of a headache, then\nasked carelessly what had happened that evening.\n\n\"Monsieur Leon,\" he said, \"went to his room early.\"\n\nShe could not help smiling, and she fell asleep, her soul filled with a\nnew delight.\n\nThe next day, at dusk, she received a visit from Monsieur Lherueux, the\ndraper. He was a man of ability, was this shopkeeper. Born a Gascon but\nbred a Norman, he grafted upon his southern volubility the cunning of\nthe Cauchois. His fat, flabby, beardless face seemed dyed by a\ndecoction of liquorice, and his white hair made even more vivid the\nkeen brilliance of his small black eyes. No one knew what he had been\nformerly; a pedlar said some, a banker at Routot according to others.\nWhat was certain was that he made complex calculations in his head that\nwould have frightened Binet himself. Polite to obsequiousness, he always\nheld himself with his back bent in the position of one who bows or who\ninvites.\n\nAfter leaving at the door his hat surrounded with crape, he put down\na green bandbox on the table, and began by complaining to madame, with\nmany civilities, that he should have remained till that day without\ngaining her confidence. A poor shop like his was not made to attract\na \"fashionable lady\"; he emphasized the words; yet she had only to\ncommand, and he would undertake to provide her with anything she might\nwish, either in haberdashery or linen, millinery or fancy goods, for\nhe went to town regularly four times a month. He was connected with the\nbest houses. You could speak of him at the \"Trois Freres,\" at the \"Barbe\nd'Or,\" or at the \"Grand Sauvage\"; all these gentlemen knew him as\nwell as the insides of their pockets. To-day, then he had come to show\nmadame, in passing, various articles he happened to have, thanks to\nthe most rare opportunity. And he pulled out half-a-dozen embroidered\ncollars from the box.\n\nMadame Bovary examined them. \"I do not require anything,\" she said.\n\nThen Monsieur Lheureux delicately exhibited three Algerian scarves,\nseveral packets of English needles, a pair of straw slippers, and\nfinally, four eggcups in cocoanut wood, carved in open work by convicts.\nThen, with both hands on the table, his neck stretched out, his figure\nbent forward, open-mouthed, he watched Emma's look, who was walking up\nand down undecided amid these goods. From time to time, as if to remove\nsome dust, he filliped with his nail the silk of the scarves spread\nout at full length, and they rustled with a little noise, making in the\ngreen twilight the gold spangles of their tissue scintillate like little\nstars.\n\n\"How much are they?\"\n\n\"A mere nothing,\" he replied, \"a mere nothing. But there's no hurry;\nwhenever it's convenient. We are not Jews.\"\n\nShe reflected for a few moments, and ended by again declining Monsieur\nLheureux's offer. He replied quite unconcernedly--\n\n\"Very well. We shall understand one another by and by. I have always got\non with ladies--if I didn't with my own!\"\n\nEmma smiled.\n\n\"I wanted to tell you,\" he went on good-naturedly, after his joke, \"that\nit isn't the money I should trouble about. Why, I could give you some,\nif need be.\"\n\nShe made a gesture of surprise.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he quickly and in a low voice, \"I shouldn't have to go far to\nfind you some, rely on that.\"\n\nAnd he began asking after Pere Tellier, the proprietor of the \"Cafe\nFrancais,\" whom Monsieur Bovary was then attending.\n\n\"What's the matter with Pere Tellier? He coughs so that he shakes his\nwhole house, and I'm afraid he'll soon want a deal covering rather than\na flannel vest. He was such a rake as a young man! Those sort of people,\nmadame, have not the least regularity; he's burnt up with brandy. Still\nit's sad, all the same, to see an acquaintance go off.\"\n\nAnd while he fastened up his box he discoursed about the doctor's\npatients.\n\n\"It's the weather, no doubt,\" he said, looking frowningly at the floor,\n\"that causes these illnesses. I, too, don't feel the thing. One of these\ndays I shall even have to consult the doctor for a pain I have in my\nback. Well, good-bye, Madame Bovary. At your service; your very humble\nservant.\" And he closed the door gently.\n\nEmma had her dinner served in her bedroom on a tray by the fireside; she\nwas a long time over it; everything was well with her.\n\n\"How good I was!\" she said to herself, thinking of the scarves.\n\nShe heard some steps on the stairs. It was Leon. She got up and took\nfrom the chest of drawers the first pile of dusters to be hemmed. When\nhe came in she seemed very busy.\n\nThe conversation languished; Madame Bovary gave it up every few minutes,\nwhilst he himself seemed quite embarrassed. Seated on a low chair near\nthe fire, he turned round in his fingers the ivory thimble-case. She\nstitched on, or from time to time turned down the hem of the cloth with\nher nail. She did not speak; he was silent, captivated by her silence,\nas he would have been by her speech.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" she thought.\n\n\"How have I displeased her?\" he asked himself.\n\nAt last, however, Leon said that he should have, one of these days, to\ngo to Rouen on some office business.\n\n\"Your music subscription is out; am I to renew it?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because--\"\n\nAnd pursing her lips she slowly drew a long stitch of grey thread.\n\nThis work irritated Leon. It seemed to roughen the ends of her fingers.\nA gallant phrase came into his head, but he did not risk it.\n\n\"Then you are giving it up?\" he went on.\n\n\"What?\" she asked hurriedly. \"Music? Ah! yes! Have I not my house to\nlook after, my husband to attend to, a thousand things, in fact, many\nduties that must be considered first?\"\n\nShe looked at the clock. Charles was late. Then, she affected anxiety.\nTwo or three times she even repeated, \"He is so good!\"\n\nThe clerk was fond of Monsieur Bovary. But this tenderness on his behalf\nastonished him unpleasantly; nevertheless he took up on his praises,\nwhich he said everyone was singing, especially the chemist.\n\n\"Ah! he is a good fellow,\" continued Emma.\n\n\"Certainly,\" replied the clerk.\n\nAnd he began talking of Madame Homais, whose very untidy appearance\ngenerally made them laugh.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" interrupted Emma. \"A good housewife does not\ntrouble about her appearance.\"\n\nThen she relapsed into silence.\n\nIt was the same on the following days; her talks, her manners,\neverything changed. She took interest in the housework, went to church\nregularly, and looked after her servant with more severity.\n\nShe took Berthe from nurse. When visitors called, Felicite brought her\nin, and Madame Bovary undressed her to show off her limbs. She declared\nshe adored children; this was her consolation, her joy, her passion,\nand she accompanied her caresses with lyrical outburst which would have\nreminded anyone but the Yonville people of Sachette in \"Notre Dame de\nParis.\"\n\nWhen Charles came home he found his slippers put to warm near the fire.\nHis waistcoat now never wanted lining, nor his shirt buttons, and it was\nquite a pleasure to see in the cupboard the night-caps arranged in piles\nof the same height. She no longer grumbled as formerly at taking a turn\nin the garden; what he proposed was always done, although she did not\nunderstand the wishes to which she submitted without a murmur; and when\nLeon saw him by his fireside after dinner, his two hands on his stomach,\nhis two feet on the fender, his two cheeks red with feeding, his eyes\nmoist with happiness, the child crawling along the carpet, and this\nwoman with the slender waist who came behind his arm-chair to kiss his\nforehead: \"What madness!\" he said to himself. \"And how to reach her!\"\n\nAnd thus she seemed so virtuous and inaccessible to him that he lost all\nhope, even the faintest. But by this renunciation he placed her on\nan extraordinary pinnacle. To him she stood outside those fleshly\nattributes from which he had nothing to obtain, and in his heart she\nrose ever, and became farther removed from him after the magnificent\nmanner of an apotheosis that is taking wing. It was one of those pure\nfeelings that do not interfere with life, that are cultivated because\nthey are rare, and whose loss would afflict more than their passion\nrejoices.\n\nEmma grew thinner, her cheeks paler, her face longer. With her black\nhair, her large eyes, her aquiline nose, her birdlike walk, and always\nsilent now, did she not seem to be passing through life scarcely\ntouching it, and to bear on her brow the vague impress of some divine\ndestiny? She was so sad and so calm, at once so gentle and so reserved,\nthat near her one felt oneself seized by an icy charm, as we shudder\nin churches at the perfume of the flowers mingling with the cold of the\nmarble. The others even did not escape from this seduction. The chemist\nsaid--\n\n\"She is a woman of great parts, who wouldn't be misplaced in a\nsub-prefecture.\"\n\nThe housewives admired her economy, the patients her politeness, the\npoor her charity.\n\nBut she was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate. That dress with\nthe narrow folds hid a distracted fear, of whose torment those chaste\nlips said nothing. She was in love with Leon, and sought solitude that\nshe might with the more ease delight in his image. The sight of his\nform troubled the voluptuousness of this mediation. Emma thrilled at\nthe sound of his step; then in his presence the emotion subsided, and\nafterwards there remained to her only an immense astonishment that ended\nin sorrow.\n\nLeon did not know that when he left her in despair she rose after he had\ngone to see him in the street. She concerned herself about his comings\nand goings; she watched his face; she invented quite a history to find\nan excuse for going to his room. The chemist's wife seemed happy to her\nto sleep under the same roof, and her thoughts constantly centered upon\nthis house, like the \"Lion d'Or\" pigeons, who came there to dip their\nred feet and white wings in its gutters. But the more Emma recognised\nher love, the more she crushed it down, that it might not be evident,\nthat she might make it less. She would have liked Leon to guess it, and\nshe imagined chances, catastrophes that should facilitate this.\n\nWhat restrained her was, no doubt, idleness and fear, and a sense of\nshame also. She thought she had repulsed him too much, that the time was\npast, that all was lost. Then, pride, and joy of being able to say to\nherself, \"I am virtuous,\" and to look at herself in the glass taking\nresigned poses, consoled her a little for the sacrifice she believed she\nwas making.\n\nThen the lusts of the flesh, the longing for money, and the melancholy\nof passion all blended themselves into one suffering, and instead of\nturning her thoughts from it, she clave to it the more, urging herself\nto pain, and seeking everywhere occasion for it. She was irritated by\nan ill-served dish or by a half-open door; bewailed the velvets she had\nnot, the happiness she had missed, her too exalted dreams, her narrow\nhome.\n\nWhat exasperated her was that Charles did not seem to notice her\nanguish. His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to her an\nimbecile insult, and his sureness on this point ingratitude. For whose\nsake, then was she virtuous? Was it not for him, the obstacle to all\nfelicity, the cause of all misery, and, as it were, the sharp clasp of\nthat complex strap that bucked her in on all sides.\n\nOn him alone, then, she concentrated all the various hatreds that\nresulted from her boredom, and every effort to diminish only augmented\nit; for this useless trouble was added to the other reasons for despair,\nand contributed still more to the separation between them. Her own\ngentleness to herself made her rebel against him. Domestic mediocrity\ndrove her to lewd fancies, marriage tenderness to adulterous desires.\nShe would have liked Charles to beat her, that she might have a better\nright to hate him, to revenge herself upon him. She was surprised\nsometimes at the atrocious conjectures that came into her thoughts, and\nshe had to go on smiling, to hear repeated to her at all hours that she\nwas happy, to pretend to be happy, to let it be believed.\n\nYet she had loathing of this hypocrisy. She was seized with the\ntemptation to flee somewhere with Leon to try a new life; but at once a\nvague chasm full of darkness opened within her soul.\n\n\"Besides, he no longer loves me,\" she thought. \"What is to become of me?\nWhat help is to be hoped for, what consolation, what solace?\"\n\nShe was left broken, breathless, inert, sobbing in a low voice, with\nflowing tears.\n\n\"Why don't you tell master?\" the servant asked her when she came in\nduring these crises.\n\n\"It is the nerves,\" said Emma. \"Do not speak to him of it; it would\nworry him.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes,\" Felicite went on, \"you are just like La Guerine, Pere\nGuerin's daughter, the fisherman at Pollet, that I used to know at\nDieppe before I came to you. She was so sad, so sad, to see her\nstanding upright on the threshold of her house, she seemed to you like a\nwinding-sheet spread out before the door. Her illness, it appears, was\na kind of fog that she had in her head, and the doctors could not do\nanything, nor the priest either. When she was taken too bad she went\noff quite alone to the sea-shore, so that the customs officer, going his\nrounds, often found her lying flat on her face, crying on the shingle.\nThen, after her marriage, it went off, they say.\"\n\n\"But with me,\" replied Emma, \"it was after marriage that it began.\"\n\n\n\nChapter Six\n\nOne evening when the window was open, and she, sitting by it, had been\nwatching Lestiboudois, the beadle, trimming the box, she suddenly heard\nthe Angelus ringing.\n\nIt was the beginning of April, when the primroses are in bloom, and a\nwarm wind blows over the flower-beds newly turned, and the gardens, like\nwomen, seem to be getting ready for the summer fetes. Through the bars\nof the arbour and away beyond the river seen in the fields, meandering\nthrough the grass in wandering curves. The evening vapours rose between\nthe leafless poplars, touching their outlines with a violet tint, paler\nand more transparent than a subtle gauze caught athwart their branches.\nIn the distance cattle moved about; neither their steps nor their lowing\ncould be heard; and the bell, still ringing through the air, kept up its\npeaceful lamentation.\n\nWith this repeated tinkling the thoughts of the young woman lost\nthemselves in old memories of her youth and school-days. She remembered\nthe great candlesticks that rose above the vases full of flowers on the\naltar, and the tabernacle with its small columns. She would have liked\nto be once more lost in the long line of white veils, marked off here\nand there by the stuff black hoods of the good sisters bending over\ntheir prie-Dieu. At mass on Sundays, when she looked up, she saw the\ngentle face of the Virgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense.\nThen she was moved; she felt herself weak and quite deserted, like the\ndown of a bird whirled by the tempest, and it was unconsciously that she\nwent towards the church, included to no matter what devotions, so that\nher soul was absorbed and all existence lost in it.\n\nOn the Place she met Lestivoudois on his way back, for, in order not\nto shorten his day's labour, he preferred interrupting his work,\nthen beginning it again, so that he rang the Angelus to suit his own\nconvenience. Besides, the ringing over a little earlier warned the lads\nof catechism hour.\n\nAlready a few who had arrived were playing marbles on the stones of the\ncemetery. Others, astride the wall, swung their legs, kicking with their\nclogs the large nettles growing between the little enclosure and the\nnewest graves. This was the only green spot. All the rest was but\nstones, always covered with a fine powder, despite the vestry-broom.\n\nThe children in list shoes ran about there as if it were an enclosure\nmade for them. The shouts of their voices could be heard through the\nhumming of the bell. This grew less and less with the swinging of the\ngreat rope that, hanging from the top of the belfry, dragged its end on\nthe ground. Swallows flitted to and fro uttering little cries, cut the\nair with the edge of their wings, and swiftly returned to their yellow\nnests under the tiles of the coping. At the end of the church a lamp was\nburning, the wick of a night-light in a glass hung up. Its light from a\ndistance looked like a white stain trembling in the oil. A long ray of\nthe sun fell across the nave and seemed to darken the lower sides and\nthe corners.\n\n\"Where is the cure?\" asked Madame Bovary of one of the lads, who was\namusing himself by shaking a swivel in a hole too large for it.\n\n\"He is just coming,\" he answered.\n\nAnd in fact the door of the presbytery grated; Abbe Bournisien appeared;\nthe children, pell-mell, fled into the church.\n\n\"These young scamps!\" murmured the priest, \"always the same!\"\n\nThen, picking up a catechism all in rags that he had struck with is\nfoot, \"They respect nothing!\" But as soon as he caught sight of Madame\nBovary, \"Excuse me,\" he said; \"I did not recognise you.\"\n\nHe thrust the catechism into his pocket, and stopped short, balancing\nthe heavy vestry key between his two fingers.\n\nThe light of the setting sun that fell full upon his face paled the\nlasting of his cassock, shiny at the elbows, unravelled at the hem.\nGrease and tobacco stains followed along his broad chest the lines\nof the buttons, and grew more numerous the farther they were from his\nneckcloth, in which the massive folds of his red chin rested; this was\ndotted with yellow spots, that disappeared beneath the coarse hair of\nhis greyish beard. He had just dined and was breathing noisily.\n\n\"How are you?\" he added.\n\n\"Not well,\" replied Emma; \"I am ill.\"\n\n\"Well, and so am I,\" answered the priest. \"These first warm days weaken\none most remarkably, don't they? But, after all, we are born to suffer,\nas St. Paul says. But what does Monsieur Bovary think of it?\"\n\n\"He!\" she said with a gesture of contempt.\n\n\"What!\" replied the good fellow, quite astonished, \"doesn't he prescribe\nsomething for you?\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Emma, \"it is no earthly remedy I need.\"\n\nBut the cure from time to time looked into the church, where the\nkneeling boys were shouldering one another, and tumbling over like packs\nof cards.\n\n\"I should like to know--\" she went on.\n\n\"You look out, Riboudet,\" cried the priest in an angry voice; \"I'll warm\nyour ears, you imp!\" Then turning to Emma, \"He's Boudet the carpenter's\nson; his parents are well off, and let him do just as he pleases. Yet he\ncould learn quickly if he would, for he is very sharp. And so sometimes\nfor a joke I call him Riboudet (like the road one takes to go to\nMaromme) and I even say 'Mon Riboudet.' Ha! Ha! 'Mont Riboudet.' The\nother day I repeated that just to Monsignor, and he laughed at it; he\ncondescended to laugh at it. And how is Monsieur Bovary?\"\n\nShe seemed not to hear him. And he went on--\n\n\"Always very busy, no doubt; for he and I are certainly the busiest\npeople in the parish. But he is doctor of the body,\" he added with a\nthick laugh, \"and I of the soul.\"\n\nShe fixed her pleading eyes upon the priest. \"Yes,\" she said, \"you\nsolace all sorrows.\"\n\n\"Ah! don't talk to me of it, Madame Bovary. This morning I had to go to\nBas-Diauville for a cow that was ill; they thought it was under a spell.\nAll their cows, I don't know how it is--But pardon me! Longuemarre and\nBoudet! Bless me! Will you leave off?\"\n\nAnd with a bound he ran into the church.\n\nThe boys were just then clustering round the large desk, climbing over\nthe precentor's footstool, opening the missal; and others on tiptoe were\njust about to venture into the confessional. But the priest suddenly\ndistributed a shower of cuffs among them. Seizing them by the collars of\ntheir coats, he lifted them from the ground, and deposited them on their\nknees on the stones of the choir, firmly, as if he meant planting them\nthere.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, when he returned to Emma, unfolding his large cotton\nhandkerchief, one corner of which he put between his teeth, \"farmers are\nmuch to be pitied.\"\n\n\"Others, too,\" she replied.\n\n\"Assuredly. Town-labourers, for example.\"\n\n\"It is not they--\"\n\n\"Pardon! I've there known poor mothers of families, virtuous women, I\nassure you, real saints, who wanted even bread.\"\n\n\"But those,\" replied Emma, and the corners of her mouth twitched as she\nspoke, \"those, Monsieur le Cure, who have bread and have no--\"\n\n\"Fire in the winter,\" said the priest.\n\n\"Oh, what does that matter?\"\n\n\"What! What does it matter? It seems to me that when one has firing and\nfood--for, after all--\"\n\n\"My God! my God!\" she sighed.\n\n\"It is indigestion, no doubt? You must get home, Madame Bovary; drink\na little tea, that will strengthen you, or else a glass of fresh water\nwith a little moist sugar.\"\n\n\"Why?\" And she looked like one awaking from a dream.\n\n\"Well, you see, you were putting your hand to your forehead. I thought\nyou felt faint.\" Then, bethinking himself, \"But you were asking me\nsomething? What was it? I really don't remember.\"\n\n\"I? Nothing! nothing!\" repeated Emma.\n\nAnd the glance she cast round her slowly fell upon the old man in the\ncassock. They looked at one another face to face without speaking.\n\n\"Then, Madame Bovary,\" he said at last, \"excuse me, but duty first, you\nknow; I must look after my good-for-nothings. The first communion will\nsoon be upon us, and I fear we shall be behind after all. So after\nAscension Day I keep them recta* an extra hour every Wednesday. Poor\nchildren! One cannot lead them too soon into the path of the Lord, as,\nmoreover, he has himself recommended us to do by the mouth of his Divine\nSon. Good health to you, madame; my respects to your husband.\"\n\n     *On the straight and narrow path.\n\nAnd he went into the church making a genuflexion as soon as he reached\nthe door.\n\nEmma saw him disappear between the double row of forms, walking with a\nheavy tread, his head a little bent over his shoulder, and with his two\nhands half-open behind him.\n\nThen she turned on her heel all of one piece, like a statue on a pivot,\nand went homewards. But the loud voice of the priest, the clear voices\nof the boys still reached her ears, and went on behind her.\n\n\"Are you a Christian?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am a Christian.\"\n\n\"What is a Christian?\"\n\n\"He who, being baptized-baptized-baptized--\"\n\nShe went up the steps of the staircase holding on to the banisters, and\nwhen she was in her room threw herself into an arm-chair.\n\nThe whitish light of the window-panes fell with soft undulations.\n\nThe furniture in its place seemed to have become more immobile, and to\nlose itself in the shadow as in an ocean of darkness. The fire was out,\nthe clock went on ticking, and Emma vaguely marvelled at this calm of\nall things while within herself was such tumult. But little Berthe was\nthere, between the window and the work-table, tottering on her knitted\nshoes, and trying to come to her mother to catch hold of the ends of her\napron-strings.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" said the latter, putting her from her with her hand.\n\nThe little girl soon came up closer against her knees, and leaning on\nthem with her arms, she looked up with her large blue eyes, while a\nsmall thread of pure saliva dribbled from her lips on to the silk apron.\n\n\"Leave me alone,\" repeated the young woman quite irritably.\n\nHer face frightened the child, who began to scream.\n\n\"Will you leave me alone?\" she said, pushing her with her elbow.\n\nBerthe fell at the foot of the drawers against the brass handle, cutting\nher cheek, which began to bleed, against it. Madame Bovary sprang to\nlift her up, broke the bell-rope, called for the servant with all her\nmight, and she was just going to curse herself when Charles appeared. It\nwas the dinner-hour; he had come home.\n\n\"Look, dear!\" said Emma, in a calm voice, \"the little one fell down\nwhile she was playing, and has hurt herself.\"\n\nCharles reassured her; the case was not a serious one, and he went for\nsome sticking plaster.\n\nMadame Bovary did not go downstairs to the dining-room; she wished\nto remain alone to look after the child. Then watching her sleep, the\nlittle anxiety she felt gradually wore off, and she seemed very stupid\nto herself, and very good to have been so worried just now at so little.\nBerthe, in fact, no longer sobbed.\n\nHer breathing now imperceptibly raised the cotton covering. Big tears\nlay in the corner of the half-closed eyelids, through whose lashes one\ncould see two pale sunken pupils; the plaster stuck on her cheek drew\nthe skin obliquely.\n\n\"It is very strange,\" thought Emma, \"how ugly this child is!\"\n\nWhen at eleven o'clock Charles came back from the chemist's shop,\nwhither he had gone after dinner to return the remainder of the\nsticking-plaster, he found his wife standing by the cradle.\n\n\"I assure you it's nothing.\" he said, kissing her on the forehead.\n\"Don't worry, my poor darling; you will make yourself ill.\"\n\nHe had stayed a long time at the chemist's. Although he had not seemed\nmuch moved, Homais, nevertheless, had exerted himself to buoy him up, to\n\"keep up his spirits.\" Then they had talked of the various dangers that\nthreaten childhood, of the carelessness of servants. Madame Homais knew\nsomething of it, having still upon her chest the marks left by a basin\nfull of soup that a cook had formerly dropped on her pinafore, and\nher good parents took no end of trouble for her. The knives were not\nsharpened, nor the floors waxed; there were iron gratings to the windows\nand strong bars across the fireplace; the little Homais, in spite of\ntheir spirit, could not stir without someone watching them; at the\nslightest cold their father stuffed them with pectorals; and until\nthey were turned four they all, without pity, had to wear wadded\nhead-protectors. This, it is true, was a fancy of Madame Homais'; her\nhusband was inwardly afflicted at it. Fearing the possible consequences\nof such compression to the intellectual organs. He even went so far as\nto say to her, \"Do you want to make Caribs or Botocudos of them?\"\n\nCharles, however, had several times tried to interrupt the conversation.\n\"I should like to speak to you,\" he had whispered in the clerk's ear,\nwho went upstairs in front of him.\n\n\"Can he suspect anything?\" Leon asked himself. His heart beat, and he\nracked his brain with surmises.\n\nAt last, Charles, having shut the door, asked him to see himself\nwhat would be the price at Rouen of a fine daguerreotypes. It was a\nsentimental surprise he intended for his wife, a delicate attention--his\nportrait in a frock-coat. But he wanted first to know \"how much it would\nbe.\" The inquiries would not put Monsieur Leon out, since he went to\ntown almost every week.\n\nWhy? Monsieur Homais suspected some \"young man's affair\" at the bottom\nof it, an intrigue. But he was mistaken. Leon was after no love-making.\nHe was sadder than ever, as Madame Lefrancois saw from the amount of\nfood he left on his plate. To find out more about it she questioned\nthe tax-collector. Binet answered roughly that he \"wasn't paid by the\npolice.\"\n\nAll the same, his companion seemed very strange to him, for Leon often\nthrew himself back in his chair, and stretching out his arms, complained vaguely of life.\n\n\"It's because you don't take enough recreation,\" said the collector.\n\n\"What recreation?\"\n\n\"If I were you I'd have a lathe.\"\n\n\"But I don't know how to turn,\" answered the clerk.\n\n\"Ah! that's true,\" said the other, rubbing his chin with an air of\nmingled contempt and satisfaction.\n\nLeon was weary of loving without any result; moreover he was beginning\nto feel that depression caused by the repetition of the same kind of\nlife, when no interest inspires and no hope sustains it. He was so bored\nwith Yonville and its inhabitants, that the sight of certain persons,\nof certain houses, irritated him beyond endurance; and the chemist, good\nfellow though he was, was becoming absolutely unbearable to him. Yet\nthe prospect of a new condition of life frightened as much as it seduced\nhim.\n\nThis apprehension soon changed into impatience, and then Paris from afar\nsounded its fanfare of masked balls with the laugh of grisettes. As he\nwas to finish reading there, why not set out at once? What prevented\nhim? And he began making home-preparations; he arranged his occupations\nbeforehand. He furnished in his head an apartment. He would lead an\nartist's life there! He would take lessons on the guitar! He would have\na dressing-gown, a Basque cap, blue velvet slippers! He even already was\nadmiring two crossed foils over his chimney-piece, with a death's head\non the guitar above them.\n\nThe difficulty was the consent of his mother; nothing, however, seemed\nmore reasonable. Even his employer advised him to go to some other\nchambers where he could advance more rapidly. Taking a middle course,\nthen, Leon looked for some place as second clerk at Rouen; found none,\nand at last wrote his mother a long letter full of details, in which\nhe set forth the reasons for going to live at Paris immediately. She\nconsented.\n\nHe did not hurry. Every day for a month Hivert carried boxes, valises,\nparcels for him from Yonville to Rouen and from Rouen to Yonville;\nand when Leon had packed up his wardrobe, had his three arm-chairs\nrestuffed, bought a stock of neckties, in a word, had made more\npreparations than for a voyage around the world, he put it off from week\nto week, until he received a second letter from his mother urging him to\nleave, since he wanted to pass his examination before the vacation.\n\nWhen the moment for the farewells had come, Madame Homais wept, Justin\nsobbed; Homais, as a man of nerve, concealed his emotion; he wished to\ncarry his friend's overcoat himself as far as the gate of the notary,\nwho was taking Leon to Rouen in his carriage.\n\nThe latter had just time to bid farewell to Monsieur Bovary.\n\nWhen he reached the head of the stairs, he stopped, he was so out of\nbreath. As he came in, Madame Bovary arose hurriedly.\n\n\"It is I again!\" said Leon.\n\n\"I was sure of it!\"\n\nShe bit her lips, and a rush of blood flowing under her skin made her\nred from the roots of her hair to the top of her collar. She remained\nstanding, leaning with her shoulder against the wainscot.\n\n\"The doctor is not here?\" he went on.\n\n\"He is out.\" She repeated, \"He is out.\"\n\nThen there was silence. They looked at one another and their thoughts,\nconfounded in the same agony, clung close together like two throbbing\nbreasts.\n\n\"I should like to kiss Berthe,\" said Leon.\n\nEmma went down a few steps and called Felicite.\n\nHe threw one long look around him that took in the walls, the\ndecorations, the fireplace, as if to penetrate everything, carry away\neverything. But she returned, and the servant brought Berthe, who was\nswinging a windmill roof downwards at the end of a string. Leon kissed\nher several times on the neck.\n\n\"Good-bye, poor child! good-bye, dear little one! good-bye!\" And he gave\nher back to her mother.\n\n\"Take her away,\" she said.\n\nThey remained alone--Madame Bovary, her back turned, her face pressed\nagainst a window-pane; Leon held his cap in his hand, knocking it softly\nagainst his thigh.\n\n\"It is going to rain,\" said Emma.\n\n\"I have a cloak,\" he answered.\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nShe turned around, her chin lowered, her forehead bent forward.\n\nThe light fell on it as on a piece of marble, to the curve of the\neyebrows, without one's being able to guess what Emma was seeing on the\nhorizon or what she was thinking within herself.\n\n\"Well, good-bye,\" he sighed.\n\nShe raised her head with a quick movement.\n\n\"Yes, good-bye--go!\"\n\nThey advanced towards each other; he held out his hand; she hesitated.\n\n\"In the English fashion, then,\" she said, giving her own hand wholly to\nhim, and forcing a laugh.\n\nLeon felt it between his fingers, and the very essence of all his being\nseemed to pass down into that moist palm. Then he opened his hand; their\neyes met again, and he disappeared.\n\nWhen he reached the market-place, he stopped and hid behind a pillar to\nlook for the last time at this white house with the four green blinds.\nHe thought he saw a shadow behind the window in the room; but the\ncurtain, sliding along the pole as though no one were touching it,\nslowly opened its long oblique folds that spread out with a single\nmovement, and thus hung straight and motionless as a plaster wall. Leon\nset off running.\n\nFrom afar he saw his employer's gig in the road, and by it a man in\na coarse apron holding the horse. Homais and Monsieur Guillaumin were\ntalking. They were waiting for him.\n\n\"Embrace me,\" said the druggist with tears in his eyes. \"Here is your\ncoat, my good friend. Mind the cold; take care of yourself; look after\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Come, Leon, jump in,\" said the notary.\n\nHomais bent over the splash-board, and in a voice broken by sobs uttered\nthese three sad words--\n\n\"A pleasant journey!\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" said Monsieur Guillaumin. \"Give him his head.\" They set\nout, and Homais went back.\n\nMadame Bovary had opened her window overlooking the garden and watched\nthe clouds. They gathered around the sunset on the side of Rouen and\nthen swiftly rolled back their black columns, behind which the great\nrays of the sun looked out like the golden arrows of a suspended trophy,\nwhile the rest of the empty heavens was white as porcelain. But a gust\nof wind bowed the poplars, and suddenly the rain fell; it pattered\nagainst the green leaves.\n\nThen the sun reappeared, the hens clucked, sparrows shook their wings in\nthe damp thickets, and the pools of water on the gravel as they flowed\naway carried off the pink flowers of an acacia.\n\n\"Ah! how far off he must be already!\" she thought.\n\nMonsieur Homais, as usual, came at half-past six during dinner.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"so we've sent off our young friend!\"\n\n\"So it seems,\" replied the doctor. Then turning on his chair; \"Any news\nat home?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. Only my wife was a little moved this afternoon. You know\nwomen--a nothing upsets them, especially my wife. And we should be\nwrong to object to that, since their nervous organization is much more\nmalleable than ours.\"\n\n\"Poor Leon!\" said Charles. \"How will he live at Paris? Will he get used\nto it?\"\n\nMadame Bovary sighed.\n\n\"Get along!\" said the chemist, smacking his lips. \"The outings at\nrestaurants, the masked balls, the champagne--all that'll be jolly\nenough, I assure you.\"\n\n\"I don't think he'll go wrong,\" objected Bovary.\n\n\"Nor do I,\" said Monsieur Homais quickly; \"although he'll have to do\nlike the rest for fear of passing for a Jesuit. And you don't know what\na life those dogs lead in the Latin quarter with actresses. Besides,\nstudents are thought a great deal of in Paris. Provided they have a few\naccomplishments, they are received in the best society; there are even\nladies of the Faubourg Saint-Germain who fall in love with them, which\nsubsequently furnishes them opportunities for making very good matches.\"\n\n\"But,\" said the doctor, \"I fear for him that down there--\"\n\n\"You are right,\" interrupted the chemist; \"that is the reverse of the\nmedal. And one is constantly obliged to keep one's hand in one's pocket\nthere. Thus, we will suppose you are in a public garden. An individual\npresents himself, well dressed, even wearing an order, and whom one\nwould take for a diplomatist. He approaches you, he insinuates himself;\noffers you a pinch of snuff, or picks up your hat. Then you become more\nintimate; he takes you to a cafe, invites you to his country-house,\nintroduces you, between two drinks, to all sorts of people; and\nthree-fourths of the time it's only to plunder your watch or lead you\ninto some pernicious step.\n\n\"That is true,\" said Charles; \"but I was thinking especially of\nillnesses--of typhoid fever, for example, that attacks students from the\nprovinces.\"\n\nEmma shuddered.\n\n\"Because of the change of regimen,\" continued the chemist, \"and of the\nperturbation that results therefrom in the whole system. And then the\nwater at Paris, don't you know! The dishes at restaurants, all the\nspiced food, end by heating the blood, and are not worth, whatever\npeople may say of them, a good soup. For my own part, I have always\npreferred plain living; it is more healthy. So when I was studying\npharmacy at Rouen, I boarded in a boarding house; I dined with the\nprofessors.\"\n\nAnd thus he went on, expounding his opinions generally and his personal\nlikings, until Justin came to fetch him for a mulled egg that was\nwanted.\n\n\"Not a moment's peace!\" he cried; \"always at it! I can't go out for a\nminute! Like a plough-horse, I have always to be moiling and toiling.\nWhat drudgery!\" Then, when he was at the door, \"By the way, do you know\nthe news?\"\n\n\"What news?\"\n\n\"That it is very likely,\" Homais went on, raising his eyebrows and\nassuming one of his most serious expression, \"that the agricultural\nmeeting of the Seine-Inferieure will be held this year at\nYonville-l'Abbaye. The rumour, at all events, is going the round. This\nmorning the paper alluded to it. It would be of the utmost importance\nfor our district. But we'll talk it over later on. I can see, thank you;\nJustin has the lantern.\"\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\n\nThe next day was a dreary one for Emma. Everything seemed to her\nenveloped in a black atmosphere floating confusedly over the exterior of\nthings, and sorrow was engulfed within her soul with soft shrieks such\nas the winter wind makes in ruined castles. It was that reverie which we\ngive to things that will not return, the lassitude that seizes you after\neverything was done; that pain, in fine, that the interruption of every\nwonted movement, the sudden cessation of any prolonged vibration, brings\non.\n\nAs on the return from Vaubyessard, when the quadrilles were running in\nher head, she was full of a gloomy melancholy, of a numb despair.\nLeon reappeared, taller, handsomer, more charming, more vague. Though\nseparated from her, he had not left her; he was there, and the walls of\nthe house seemed to hold his shadow.\n\nShe could not detach her eyes from the carpet where he had walked, from\nthose empty chairs where he had sat. The river still flowed on, and\nslowly drove its ripples along the slippery banks.\n\nThey had often walked there to the murmur of the waves over the\nmoss-covered pebbles. How bright the sun had been! What happy afternoons\nthey had seen alone in the shade at the end of the garden! He read\naloud, bareheaded, sitting on a footstool of dry sticks; the fresh wind\nof the meadow set trembling the leaves of the book and the nasturtiums\nof the arbour. Ah! he was gone, the only charm of her life, the only\npossible hope of joy. Why had she not seized this happiness when it came\nto her? Why not have kept hold of it with both hands, with both knees,\nwhen it was about to flee from her? And she cursed herself for not\nhaving loved Leon. She thirsted for his lips. The wish took possession\nof her to run after and rejoin him, throw herself into his arms and\nsay to him, \"It is I; I am yours.\" But Emma recoiled beforehand at the\ndifficulties of the enterprise, and her desires, increased by regret,\nbecame only the more acute.\n\nHenceforth the memory of Leon was the centre of her boredom; it burnt\nthere more brightly than the fire travellers have left on the snow of\na Russian steppe. She sprang towards him, she pressed against him, she\nstirred carefully the dying embers, sought all around her anything\nthat could revive it; and the most distant reminiscences, like the most\nimmediate occasions, what she experienced as well as what she imagined,\nher voluptuous desires that were unsatisfied, her projects of happiness\nthat crackled in the wind like dead boughs, her sterile virtue, her\nlost hopes, the domestic tete-a-tete--she gathered it all up, took\neverything, and made it all serve as fuel for her melancholy.\n\nThe flames, however, subsided, either because the supply had exhausted\nitself, or because it had been piled up too much. Love, little by\nlittle, was quelled by absence; regret stifled beneath habit; and this\nincendiary light that had empurpled her pale sky was overspread and\nfaded by degrees. In the supineness of her conscience she even took her\nrepugnance towards her husband for aspirations towards her lover, the\nburning of hate for the warmth of tenderness; but as the tempest still\nraged, and as passion burnt itself down to the very cinders, and no help\ncame, no sun rose, there was night on all sides, and she was lost in the\nterrible cold that pierced her.\n\nThen the evil days of Tostes began again. She thought herself now far\nmore unhappy; for she had the experience of grief, with the certainty\nthat it would not end.\n\nA woman who had laid on herself such sacrifices could well allow herself\ncertain whims. She bought a Gothic prie-dieu, and in a month spent\nfourteen francs on lemons for polishing her nails; she wrote to Rouen\nfor a blue cashmere gown; she chose one of Lheureux's finest scarves,\nand wore it knotted around her waist over her dressing-gown; and, with\nclosed blinds and a book in her hand, she lay stretched out on a couch\nin this garb.\n\nShe often changed her coiffure; she did her hair a la Chinoise, in\nflowing curls, in plaited coils; she parted in on one side and rolled it\nunder like a man's.\n\nShe wanted to learn Italian; she bought dictionaries, a grammar, and\na supply of white paper. She tried serious reading, history, and\nphilosophy. Sometimes in the night Charles woke up with a start,\nthinking he was being called to a patient. \"I'm coming,\" he stammered;\nand it was the noise of a match Emma had struck to relight the lamp. But\nher reading fared like her piece of embroidery, all of which, only just\nbegun, filled her cupboard; she took it up, left it, passed on to other\nbooks.\n\nShe had attacks in which she could easily have been driven to commit any\nfolly. She maintained one day, in opposition to her husband, that she\ncould drink off a large glass of brandy, and, as Charles was stupid\nenough to dare her to, she swallowed the brandy to the last drop.\n\nIn spite of her vapourish airs (as the housewives of Yonville called\nthem), Emma, all the same, never seemed gay, and usually she had at the\ncorners of her mouth that immobile contraction that puckers the faces of\nold maids, and those of men whose ambition has failed. She was pale all\nover, white as a sheet; the skin of her nose was drawn at the nostrils,\nher eyes looked at you vaguely. After discovering three grey hairs on\nher temples, she talked much of her old age.\n\nShe often fainted. One day she even spat blood, and, as Charles fussed\naround her showing his anxiety--\n\n\"Bah!\" she answered, \"what does it matter?\"\n\nCharles fled to his study and wept there, both his elbows on the table,\nsitting in an arm-chair at his bureau under the phrenological head.\n\nThen he wrote to his mother begging her to come, and they had many long\nconsultations together on the subject of Emma.\n\nWhat should they decide? What was to be done since she rejected all\nmedical treatment? \"Do you know what your wife wants?\" replied Madame\nBovary senior.\n\n\"She wants to be forced to occupy herself with some manual work. If she\nwere obliged, like so many others, to earn her living, she wouldn't have\nthese vapours, that come to her from a lot of ideas she stuffs into her\nhead, and from the idleness in which she lives.\"\n\n\"Yet she is always busy,\" said Charles.\n\n\"Ah! always busy at what? Reading novels, bad books, works against\nreligion, and in which they mock at priests in speeches taken from\nVoltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor child. Anyone who\nhas no religion always ends by turning out badly.\"\n\nSo it was decided to stop Emma reading novels. The enterprise did not\nseem easy. The good lady undertook it. She was, when she passed through\nRouen, to go herself to the lending-library and represent that Emma had\ndiscontinued her subscription. Would they not have a right to apply\nto the police if the librarian persisted all the same in his poisonous\ntrade? The farewells of mother and daughter-in-law were cold. During\nthe three weeks that they had been together they had not exchanged\nhalf-a-dozen words apart from the inquiries and phrases when they met at\ntable and in the evening before going to bed.\n\nMadame Bovary left on a Wednesday, the market-day at Yonville.\n\nThe Place since morning had been blocked by a row of carts, which, on\nend and their shafts in the air, spread all along the line of houses\nfrom the church to the inn. On the other side there were canvas booths,\nwhere cotton checks, blankets, and woollen stockings were sold,\ntogether with harness for horses, and packets of blue ribbon, whose ends\nfluttered in the wind. The coarse hardware was spread out on the ground\nbetween pyramids of eggs and hampers of cheeses, from which sticky straw\nstuck out.\n\nNear the corn-machines clucking hens passed their necks through the bars\nof flat cages. The people, crowding in the same place and unwilling\nto move thence, sometimes threatened to smash the shop front of the\nchemist. On Wednesdays his shop was never empty, and the people pushed\nin less to buy drugs than for consultations. So great was Homais'\nreputation in the neighbouring villages. His robust aplomb had\nfascinated the rustics. They considered him a greater doctor than all\nthe doctors.\n\nEmma was leaning out at the window; she was often there. The window in\nthe provinces replaces the theatre and the promenade, she was amusing\nherself with watching the crowd of boors when she saw a gentleman in\na green velvet coat. He had on yellow gloves, although he wore heavy\ngaiters; he was coming towards the doctor's house, followed by a peasant\nwalking with a bent head and quite a thoughtful air.\n\n\"Can I see the doctor?\" he asked Justin, who was talking on the\ndoorsteps with Felicite, and, taking him for a servant of the\nhouse--\"Tell him that Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger of La Huchette is\nhere.\"\n\nIt was not from territorial vanity that the new arrival added \"of La\nHuchette\" to his name, but to make himself the better known.\n\nLa Huchette, in fact, was an estate near Yonville, where he had just\nbought the chateau and two farms that he cultivated himself, without,\nhowever, troubling very much about them. He lived as a bachelor, and was\nsupposed to have \"at least fifteen thousand francs a year.\"\n\nCharles came into the room. Monsieur Boulanger introduced his man, who\nwanted to be bled because he felt \"a tingling all over.\"\n\n\"That'll purge me,\" he urged as an objection to all reasoning.\n\nSo Bovary ordered a bandage and a basin, and asked Justin to hold it.\nThen addressing the peasant, who was already pale--\n\n\"Don't be afraid, my lad.\"\n\n\"No, no, sir,\" said the other; \"get on.\"\n\nAnd with an air of bravado he held out his great arm. At the prick of\nthe lancet the blood spurted out, splashing against the looking-glass.\n\n\"Hold the basin nearer,\" exclaimed Charles.\n\n\"Lor!\" said the peasant, \"one would swear it was a little fountain\nflowing. How red my blood is! That's a good sign, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Sometimes,\" answered the doctor, \"one feels nothing at first, and then\nsyncope sets in, and more especially with people of strong constitution\nlike this man.\"\n\nAt these words the rustic let go the lancet-case he was twisting between\nhis fingers. A shudder of his shoulders made the chair-back creak. His\nhat fell off.\n\n\"I thought as much,\" said Bovary, pressing his finger on the vein.\n\nThe basin was beginning to tremble in Justin's hands; his knees shook,\nhe turned pale.\n\n\"Emma! Emma!\" called Charles.\n\nWith one bound she came down the staircase.\n\n\"Some vinegar,\" he cried. \"O dear! two at once!\"\n\nAnd in his emotion he could hardly put on the compress.\n\n\"It is nothing,\" said Monsieur Boulanger quietly, taking Justin in his\narms. He seated him on the table with his back resting against the wall.\n\nMadame Bovary began taking off his cravat. The strings of his shirt had\ngot into a knot, and she was for some minutes moving her light fingers\nabout the young fellow's neck. Then she poured some vinegar on her\ncambric handkerchief; she moistened his temples with little dabs, and\nthen blew upon them softly. The ploughman revived, but Justin's syncope\nstill lasted, and his eyeballs disappeared in the pale sclerotics like\nblue flowers in milk.\n\n\"We must hide this from him,\" said Charles.\n\nMadame Bovary took the basin to put it under the table. With the\nmovement she made in bending down, her dress (it was a summer dress with\nfour flounces, yellow, long in the waist and wide in the skirt) spread\nout around her on the flags of the room; and as Emma stooping, staggered\na little as she stretched out her arms.\n\nThe stuff here and there gave with the inflections of her bust.\n\nThen she went to fetch a bottle of water, and she was melting some\npieces of sugar when the chemist arrived. The servant had been to\nfetch him in the tumult. Seeing his pupil's eyes staring he drew a long\nbreath; then going around him he looked at him from head to foot.\n\n\"Fool!\" he said, \"really a little fool! A fool in four letters! A\nphlebotomy's a big affair, isn't it! And a fellow who isn't afraid of\nanything; a kind of squirrel, just as he is who climbs to vertiginous\nheights to shake down nuts. Oh, yes! you just talk to me, boast about\nyourself! Here's a fine fitness for practising pharmacy later on; for\nunder serious circumstances you may be called before the tribunals in\norder to enlighten the minds of the magistrates, and you would have to\nkeep your head then, to reason, show yourself a man, or else pass for an\nimbecile.\"\n\nJustin did not answer. The chemist went on--\n\n\"Who asked you to come? You are always pestering the doctor and madame.\nOn Wednesday, moreover, your presence is indispensable to me. There are\nnow twenty people in the shop. I left everything because of the interest\nI take in you. Come, get along! Sharp! Wait for me, and keep an eye on\nthe jars.\"\n\nWhen Justin, who was rearranging his dress, had gone, they talked for a\nlittle while about fainting-fits. Madame Bovary had never fainted.\n\n\"That is extraordinary for a lady,\" said Monsieur Boulanger; \"but some\npeople are very susceptible. Thus in a duel, I have seen a second lose\nconsciousness at the mere sound of the loading of pistols.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" said the chemist, \"the sight of other people's blood\ndoesn't affect me at all, but the mere thought of my own flowing would\nmake me faint if I reflected upon it too much.\"\n\nMonsieur Boulanger, however, dismissed his servant, advising him to calm\nhimself, since his fancy was over.\n\n\"It procured me the advantage of making your acquaintance,\" he added,\nand he looked at Emma as he said this. Then he put three francs on the\ncorner of the table, bowed negligently, and went out.\n\nHe was soon on the other side of the river (this was his way back to La\nHuchette), and Emma saw him in the meadow, walking under the poplars,\nslackening his pace now and then as one who reflects.\n\n\"She is very pretty,\" he said to himself; \"she is very pretty, this\ndoctor's wife. Fine teeth, black eyes, a dainty foot, a figure like a\nParisienne's. Where the devil does she come from? Wherever did that fat\nfellow pick her up?\"\n\nMonsieur Rodolphe Boulanger was thirty-four; he was of brutal\ntemperament and intelligent perspicacity, having, moreover, had much to\ndo with women, and knowing them well. This one had seemed pretty to him;\nso he was thinking about her and her husband.\n\n\"I think he is very stupid. She is tired of him, no doubt. He has dirty\nnails, and hasn't shaved for three days. While he is trotting after his\npatients, she sits there botching socks. And she gets bored! She would\nlike to live in town and dance polkas every evening. Poor little woman!\nShe is gaping after love like a carp after water on a kitchen-table.\nWith three words of gallantry she'd adore one, I'm sure of it. She'd be\ntender, charming. Yes; but how to get rid of her afterwards?\"\n\nThen the difficulties of love-making seen in the distance made him by\ncontrast think of his mistress. She was an actress at Rouen, whom he\nkept; and when he had pondered over this image, with which, even in\nremembrance, he was satiated--\n\n\"Ah! Madame Bovary,\" he thought, \"is much prettier, especially fresher.\nVirginie is decidedly beginning to grow fat. She is so finiky about her\npleasures; and, besides, she has a mania for prawns.\"\n\nThe fields were empty, and around him Rodolphe only heard the regular\nbeating of the grass striking against his boots, with a cry of the\ngrasshopper hidden at a distance among the oats. He again saw Emma in\nher room, dressed as he had seen her, and he undressed her.\n\n\"Oh, I will have her,\" he cried, striking a blow with his stick at a\nclod in front of him. And he at once began to consider the political\npart of the enterprise. He asked himself--\n\n\"Where shall we meet? By what means? We shall always be having the brat\non our hands, and the servant, the neighbours, and husband, all sorts of\nworries. Pshaw! one would lose too much time over it.\"\n\nThen he resumed, \"She really has eyes that pierce one's heart like a\ngimlet. And that pale complexion! I adore pale women!\"\n\nWhen he reached the top of the Arguiel hills he had made up his mind.\n\"It's only finding the opportunities. Well, I will call in now and then.\nI'll send them venison, poultry; I'll have myself bled, if need be. We\nshall become friends; I'll invite them to my place. By Jove!\" added he,\n\"there's the agricultural show coming on. She'll be there. I shall see\nher. We'll begin boldly, for that's the surest way.\"\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n\nAt last it came, the famous agricultural show. On the morning of the\nsolemnity all the inhabitants at their doors were chatting over the\npreparations. The pediment of the town hall had been hung with garlands\nof ivy; a tent had been erected in a meadow for the banquet; and in the\nmiddle of the Place, in front of the church, a kind of bombarde was\nto announce the arrival of the prefect and the names of the successful\nfarmers who had obtained prizes. The National Guard of Buchy (there was\nnone at Yonville) had come to join the corps of firemen, of whom Binet\nwas captain. On that day he wore a collar even higher than usual; and,\ntightly buttoned in his tunic, his figure was so stiff and motionless\nthat the whole vital portion of his person seemed to have descended into\nhis legs, which rose in a cadence of set steps with a single movement.\nAs there was some rivalry between the tax-collector and the colonel,\nboth, to show off their talents, drilled their men separately. One\nsaw the red epaulettes and the black breastplates pass and re-pass\nalternately; there was no end to it, and it constantly began again.\nThere had never been such a display of pomp. Several citizens had\nscoured their houses the evening before; tri-coloured flags hung from\nhalf-open windows; all the public-houses were full; and in the lovely\nweather the starched caps, the golden crosses, and the coloured\nneckerchiefs seemed whiter than snow, shone in the sun, and relieved\nwith the motley colours the sombre monotony of the frock-coats and blue\nsmocks. The neighbouring farmers' wives, when they got off their horses,\npulled out the long pins that fastened around them their dresses, turned\nup for fear of mud; and the husbands, for their part, in order to save\ntheir hats, kept their handkerchiefs around them, holding one corner\nbetween their teeth.\n\nThe crowd came into the main street from both ends of the village.\nPeople poured in from the lanes, the alleys, the houses; and from time\nto time one heard knockers banging against doors closing behind women\nwith their gloves, who were going out to see the fete. What was most\nadmired were two long lamp-stands covered with lanterns, that flanked a\nplatform on which the authorities were to sit. Besides this there were\nagainst the four columns of the town hall four kinds of poles,\neach bearing a small standard of greenish cloth, embellished with\ninscriptions in gold letters.\n\nOn one was written, \"To Commerce\"; on the other, \"To Agriculture\"; on\nthe third, \"To Industry\"; and on the fourth, \"To the Fine Arts.\"\n\nBut the jubilation that brightened all faces seemed to darken that of\nMadame Lefrancois, the innkeeper. Standing on her kitchen-steps she\nmuttered to herself, \"What rubbish! what rubbish! With their canvas\nbooth! Do they think the prefect will be glad to dine down there under\na tent like a gipsy? They call all this fussing doing good to the place!\nThen it wasn't worth while sending to Neufchatel for the keeper of a\ncookshop! And for whom? For cowherds! tatterdemalions!\"\n\nThe druggist was passing. He had on a frock-coat, nankeen trousers,\nbeaver shoes, and, for a wonder, a hat with a low crown.\n\n\"Your servant! Excuse me, I am in a hurry.\" And as the fat widow asked\nwhere he was going--\n\n\"It seems odd to you, doesn't it, I who am always more cooped up in my\nlaboratory than the man's rat in his cheese.\"\n\n\"What cheese?\" asked the landlady.\n\n\"Oh, nothing! nothing!\" Homais continued. \"I merely wished to convey\nto you, Madame Lefrancois, that I usually live at home like a recluse.\nTo-day, however, considering the circumstances, it is necessary--\"\n\n\"Oh, you're going down there!\" she said contemptuously.\n\n\"Yes, I am going,\" replied the druggist, astonished. \"Am I not a member\nof the consulting commission?\"\n\nMere Lefrancois looked at him for a few moments, and ended by saying\nwith a smile--\n\n\"That's another pair of shoes! But what does agriculture matter to you?\nDo you understand anything about it?\"\n\n\"Certainly I understand it, since I am a druggist--that is to say,\na chemist. And the object of chemistry, Madame Lefrancois, being the\nknowledge of the reciprocal and molecular action of all natural bodies,\nit follows that agriculture is comprised within its domain. And, in\nfact, the composition of the manure, the fermentation of liquids, the\nanalyses of gases, and the influence of miasmata, what, I ask you, is\nall this, if it isn't chemistry, pure and simple?\"\n\nThe landlady did not answer. Homais went on--\n\n\"Do you think that to be an agriculturist it is necessary to have tilled\nthe earth or fattened fowls oneself? It is necessary rather to know the\ncomposition of the substances in question--the geological strata, the\natmospheric actions, the quality of the soil, the minerals, the waters,\nthe density of the different bodies, their capillarity, and what not.\nAnd one must be master of all the principles of hygiene in order to\ndirect, criticize the construction of buildings, the feeding of animals,\nthe diet of domestics. And, moreover, Madame Lefrancois, one must know\nbotany, be able to distinguish between plants, you understand, which are\nthe wholesome and those that are deleterious, which are unproductive\nand which nutritive, if it is well to pull them up here and re-sow them\nthere, to propagate some, destroy others; in brief, one must keep pace\nwith science by means of pamphlets and public papers, be always on the\nalert to find out improvements.\"\n\nThe landlady never took her eyes off the \"Cafe Francois\" and the chemist\nwent on--\n\n\"Would to God our agriculturists were chemists, or that at least they\nwould pay more attention to the counsels of science. Thus lately I\nmyself wrote a considerable tract, a memoir of over seventy-two pages,\nentitled, 'Cider, its Manufacture and its Effects, together with some\nNew Reflections on the Subject,' that I sent to the Agricultural Society\nof Rouen, and which even procured me the honour of being received among\nits members--Section, Agriculture; Class, Pomological. Well, if my\nwork had been given to the public--\" But the druggist stopped, Madame\nLefrancois seemed so preoccupied.\n\n\"Just look at them!\" she said. \"It's past comprehension! Such a cookshop\nas that!\" And with a shrug of the shoulders that stretched out over her\nbreast the stitches of her knitted bodice, she pointed with both hands\nat her rival's inn, whence songs were heard issuing. \"Well, it won't\nlast long,\" she added. \"It'll be over before a week.\"\n\nHomais drew back with stupefaction. She came down three steps and\nwhispered in his ear--\n\n\"What! you didn't know it? There is to be an execution in next week.\nIt's Lheureux who is selling him out; he has killed him with bills.\"\n\n\"What a terrible catastrophe!\" cried the druggist, who always found\nexpressions in harmony with all imaginable circumstances.\n\nThen the landlady began telling him the story that she had heard from\nTheodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, and although she detested\nTellier, she blamed Lheureux. He was \"a wheedler, a sneak.\"\n\n\"There!\" she said. \"Look at him! he is in the market; he is bowing to\nMadame Bovary, who's got on a green bonnet. Why, she's taking Monsieur\nBoulanger's arm.\"\n\n\"Madame Bovary!\" exclaimed Homais. \"I must go at once and pay her my\nrespects. Perhaps she'll be very glad to have a seat in the enclosure\nunder the peristyle.\" And, without heeding Madame Lefrancois, who was\ncalling him back to tell him more about it, the druggist walked off\nrapidly with a smile on his lips, with straight knees, bowing copiously\nto right and left, and taking up much room with the large tails of his\nfrock-coat that fluttered behind him in the wind.\n\nRodolphe, having caught sight of him from afar, hurried on, but Madame\nBovary lost her breath; so he walked more slowly, and, smiling at her,\nsaid in a rough tone--\n\n\"It's only to get away from that fat fellow, you know, the druggist.\"\nShe pressed his elbow.\n\n\"What's the meaning of that?\" he asked himself. And he looked at her out\nof the corner of his eyes.\n\nHer profile was so calm that one could guess nothing from it. It stood\nout in the light from the oval of her bonnet, with pale ribbons on it\nlike the leaves of weeds. Her eyes with their long curved lashes looked\nstraight before her, and though wide open, they seemed slightly puckered\nby the cheek-bones, because of the blood pulsing gently under the\ndelicate skin. A pink line ran along the partition between her nostrils.\nHer head was bent upon her shoulder, and the pearl tips of her white\nteeth were seen between her lips.\n\n\"Is she making fun of me?\" thought Rodolphe.\n\nEmma's gesture, however, had only been meant for a warning; for Monsieur\nLheureux was accompanying them, and spoke now and again as if to enter\ninto the conversation.\n\n\"What a superb day! Everybody is out! The wind is east!\"\n\nAnd neither Madame Bovary nor Rodolphe answered him, whilst at the\nslightest movement made by them he drew near, saying, \"I beg your\npardon!\" and raised his hat.\n\nWhen they reached the farrier's house, instead of following the road\nup to the fence, Rodolphe suddenly turned down a path, drawing with him\nMadame Bovary. He called out--\n\n\"Good evening, Monsieur Lheureux! See you again presently.\"\n\n\"How you got rid of him!\" she said, laughing.\n\n\"Why,\" he went on, \"allow oneself to be intruded upon by others? And as\nto-day I have the happiness of being with you--\"\n\nEmma blushed. He did not finish his sentence. Then he talked of the fine\nweather and of the pleasure of walking on the grass. A few daisies had\nsprung up again.\n\n\"Here are some pretty Easter daisies,\" he said, \"and enough of them to\nfurnish oracles to all the amorous maids in the place.\"\n\nHe added, \"Shall I pick some? What do you think?\"\n\n\"Are you in love?\" she asked, coughing a little.\n\n\"H'm, h'm! who knows?\" answered Rodolphe.\n\nThe meadow began to fill, and the housewives hustled you with their\ngreat umbrellas, their baskets, and their babies. One had often to get\nout of the way of a long file of country folk, servant-maids with blue\nstockings, flat shoes, silver rings, and who smelt of milk, when one\npassed close to them. They walked along holding one another by the hand,\nand thus they spread over the whole field from the row of open trees to\nthe banquet tent.\n\nBut this was the examination time, and the farmers one after the other\nentered a kind of enclosure formed by a long cord supported on sticks.\n\nThe beasts were there, their noses towards the cord, and making a\nconfused line with their unequal rumps. Drowsy pigs were burrowing in\nthe earth with their snouts, calves were bleating, lambs baaing; the\ncows, on knees folded in, were stretching their bellies on the grass,\nslowly chewing the cud, and blinking their heavy eyelids at the gnats\nthat buzzed round them. Plough-men with bare arms were holding by the\nhalter prancing stallions that neighed with dilated nostrils looking\ntowards the mares. These stood quietly, stretching out their heads and\nflowing manes, while their foals rested in their shadow, or now and then\ncame and sucked them. And above the long undulation of these crowded\nanimals one saw some white mane rising in the wind like a wave, or some\nsharp horns sticking out, and the heads of men running about. Apart,\noutside the enclosure, a hundred paces off, was a large black bull,\nmuzzled, with an iron ring in its nostrils, and who moved no more than\nif he had been in bronze. A child in rags was holding him by a rope.\n\nBetween the two lines the committee-men were walking with heavy steps,\nexamining each animal, then consulting one another in a low voice. One\nwho seemed of more importance now and then took notes in a book as he\nwalked along. This was the president of the jury, Monsieur Derozerays de\nla Panville. As soon as he recognised Rodolphe he came forward quickly,\nand smiling amiably, said--\n\n\"What! Monsieur Boulanger, you are deserting us?\"\n\nRodolphe protested that he was just coming. But when the president had\ndisappeared--\n\n\"Ma foi!*\" said he, \"I shall not go. Your company is better than his.\"\n\n     *Upon my word!\n\nAnd while poking fun at the show, Rodolphe, to move about more easily,\nshowed the gendarme his blue card, and even stopped now and then in\nfront of some fine beast, which Madame Bovary did not at all admire.\nHe noticed this, and began jeering at the Yonville ladies and their\ndresses; then he apologised for the negligence of his own. He had that\nincongruity of common and elegant in which the habitually vulgar think\nthey see the revelation of an eccentric existence, of the perturbations\nof sentiment, the tyrannies of art, and always a certain contempt for\nsocial conventions, that seduces or exasperates them. Thus his cambric\nshirt with plaited cuffs was blown out by the wind in the opening of his\nwaistcoat of grey ticking, and his broad-striped trousers disclosed at\nthe ankle nankeen boots with patent leather gaiters.\n\nThese were so polished that they reflected the grass. He trampled on\nhorses's dung with them, one hand in the pocket of his jacket and his\nstraw hat on one side.\n\n\"Besides,\" added he, \"when one lives in the country--\"\n\n\"It's waste of time,\" said Emma.\n\n\"That is true,\" replied Rodolphe. \"To think that not one of these people\nis capable of understanding even the cut of a coat!\"\n\nThen they talked about provincial mediocrity, of the lives it crushed,\nthe illusions lost there.\n\n\"And I too,\" said Rodolphe, \"am drifting into depression.\"\n\n\"You!\" she said in astonishment; \"I thought you very light-hearted.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes. I seem so, because in the midst of the world I know how to\nwear the mask of a scoffer upon my face; and yet, how many a time at the\nsight of a cemetery by moonlight have I not asked myself whether it were\nnot better to join those sleeping there!\"\n\n\"Oh! and your friends?\" she said. \"You do not think of them.\"\n\n\"My friends! What friends? Have I any? Who cares for me?\" And he\naccompanied the last words with a kind of whistling of the lips.\n\nBut they were obliged to separate from each other because of a great\npile of chairs that a man was carrying behind them. He was so overladen\nwith them that one could only see the tips of his wooden shoes and the\nends of his two outstretched arms. It was Lestiboudois, the gravedigger,\nwho was carrying the church chairs about amongst the people. Alive to\nall that concerned his interests, he had hit upon this means of turning\nthe show to account; and his idea was succeeding, for he no longer knew\nwhich way to turn. In fact, the villagers, who were hot, quarreled for\nthese seats, whose straw smelt of incense, and they leant against the\nthick backs, stained with the wax of candles, with a certain veneration.\n\nMadame Bovary again took Rodolphe's arm; he went on as if speaking to\nhimself--\n\n\"Yes, I have missed so many things. Always alone! Ah! if I had some aim\nin life, if I had met some love, if I had found someone! Oh, how I would\nhave spent all the energy of which I am capable, surmounted everything,\novercome everything!\"\n\n\"Yet it seems to me,\" said Emma, \"that you are not to be pitied.\"\n\n\"Ah! you think so?\" said Rodolphe.\n\n\"For, after all,\" she went on, \"you are free--\" she hesitated, \"rich--\"\n\n\"Do not mock me,\" he replied.\n\nAnd she protested that she was not mocking him, when the report of a\ncannon resounded. Immediately all began hustling one another pell-mell\ntowards the village.\n\nIt was a false alarm. The prefect seemed not to be coming, and the\nmembers of the jury felt much embarrassed, not knowing if they ought to\nbegin the meeting or still wait.\n\nAt last at the end of the Place a large hired landau appeared, drawn by\ntwo thin horses, which a coachman in a white hat was whipping lustily.\nBinet had only just time to shout, \"Present arms!\" and the colonel to\nimitate him. All ran towards the enclosure; everyone pushed forward. A\nfew even forgot their collars; but the equipage of the prefect seemed\nto anticipate the crowd, and the two yoked jades, trapesing in their\nharness, came up at a little trot in front of the peristyle of the town\nhall at the very moment when the National Guard and firemen deployed,\nbeating drums and marking time.\n\n\"Present!\" shouted Binet.\n\n\"Halt!\" shouted the colonel. \"Left about, march.\"\n\nAnd after presenting arms, during which the clang of the band, letting\nloose, rang out like a brass kettle rolling downstairs, all the guns\nwere lowered. Then was seen stepping down from the carriage a gentleman\nin a short coat with silver braiding, with bald brow, and wearing a tuft\nof hair at the back of his head, of a sallow complexion and the most\nbenign appearance. His eyes, very large and covered by heavy lids, were\nhalf-closed to look at the crowd, while at the same time he raised his\nsharp nose, and forced a smile upon his sunken mouth. He recognised the\nmayor by his scarf, and explained to him that the prefect was not able\nto come. He himself was a councillor at the prefecture; then he added\na few apologies. Monsieur Tuvache answered them with compliments; the\nother confessed himself nervous; and they remained thus, face to face,\ntheir foreheads almost touching, with the members of the jury all round,\nthe municipal council, the notable personages, the National Guard and\nthe crowd. The councillor pressing his little cocked hat to his\nbreast repeated his bows, while Tuvache, bent like a bow, also smiled,\nstammered, tried to say something, protested his devotion to the\nmonarchy and the honour that was being done to Yonville.\n\nHippolyte, the groom from the inn, took the head of the horses from the\ncoachman, and, limping along with his club-foot, led them to the door\nof the \"Lion d'Or\", where a number of peasants collected to look at the\ncarriage. The drum beat, the howitzer thundered, and the gentlemen one\nby one mounted the platform, where they sat down in red utrecht velvet\narm-chairs that had been lent by Madame Tuvache.\n\nAll these people looked alike. Their fair flabby faces, somewhat tanned\nby the sun, were the colour of sweet cider, and their puffy whiskers\nemerged from stiff collars, kept up by white cravats with broad bows.\nAll the waist-coats were of velvet, double-breasted; all the watches\nhad, at the end of a long ribbon, an oval cornelian seal; everyone\nrested his two hands on his thighs, carefully stretching the stride of\ntheir trousers, whose unsponged glossy cloth shone more brilliantly than\nthe leather of their heavy boots.\n\nThe ladies of the company stood at the back under the vestibule between\nthe pillars while the common herd was opposite, standing up or sitting\non chairs. As a matter of fact, Lestiboudois had brought thither all\nthose that he had moved from the field, and he even kept running back\nevery minute to fetch others from the church. He caused such confusion\nwith this piece of business that one had great difficulty in getting to\nthe small steps of the platform.\n\n\"I think,\" said Monsieur Lheureux to the chemist, who was passing to his\nplace, \"that they ought to have put up two Venetian masts with something\nrather severe and rich for ornaments; it would have been a very pretty\neffect.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" replied Homais; \"but what can you expect? The mayor took\neverything on his own shoulders. He hasn't much taste. Poor Tuvache! and\nhe is even completely destitute of what is called the genius of art.\"\n\nRodolphe, meanwhile, with Madame Bovary, had gone up to the first\nfloor of the town hall, to the \"council-room,\" and, as it was empty,\nhe declared that they could enjoy the sight there more comfortably. He\nfetched three stools from the round table under the bust of the monarch,\nand having carried them to one of the windows, they sat down by each\nother.\n\nThere was commotion on the platform, long whisperings, much parleying.\nAt last the councillor got up. They knew now that his name was Lieuvain,\nand in the crowd the name was passed from one to the other. After he had\ncollated a few pages, and bent over them to see better, he began--\n\n\"Gentlemen! May I be permitted first of all (before addressing you on\nthe object of our meeting to-day, and this sentiment will, I am sure, be\nshared by you all), may I be permitted, I say, to pay a tribute to the\nhigher administration, to the government to the monarch, gentle men, our\nsovereign, to that beloved king, to whom no branch of public or private\nprosperity is a matter of indifference, and who directs with a hand at\nonce so firm and wise the chariot of the state amid the incessant perils\nof a stormy sea, knowing, moreover, how to make peace respected as well\nas war, industry, commerce, agriculture, and the fine arts?\"\n\n\"I ought,\" said Rodolphe, \"to get back a little further.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Emma.\n\nBut at this moment the voice of the councillor rose to an extraordinary\npitch. He declaimed--\n\n\"This is no longer the time, gentlemen, when civil discord ensanguined\nour public places, when the landlord, the business-man, the working-man\nhimself, falling asleep at night, lying down to peaceful sleep, trembled\nlest he should be awakened suddenly by the noise of incendiary tocsins,\nwhen the most subversive doctrines audaciously sapped foundations.\"\n\n\"Well, someone down there might see me,\" Rodolphe resumed, \"then\nI should have to invent excuses for a fortnight; and with my bad\nreputation--\"\n\n\"Oh, you are slandering yourself,\" said Emma.\n\n\"No! It is dreadful, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But, gentlemen,\" continued the councillor, \"if, banishing from my\nmemory the remembrance of these sad pictures, I carry my eyes back\nto the actual situation of our dear country, what do I see there?\nEverywhere commerce and the arts are flourishing; everywhere new means\nof communication, like so many new arteries in the body of the state,\nestablish within it new relations. Our great industrial centres have\nrecovered all their activity; religion, more consolidated, smiles in\nall hearts; our ports are full, confidence is born again, and France\nbreathes once more!\"\n\n\"Besides,\" added Rodolphe, \"perhaps from the world's point of view they\nare right.\"\n\n\"How so?\" she asked.\n\n\"What!\" said he. \"Do you not know that there are souls constantly\ntormented? They need by turns to dream and to act, the purest passions\nand the most turbulent joys, and thus they fling themselves into all\nsorts of fantasies, of follies.\"\n\nThen she looked at him as one looks at a traveller who has voyaged over\nstrange lands, and went on--\n\n\"We have not even this distraction, we poor women!\"\n\n\"A sad distraction, for happiness isn't found in it.\"\n\n\"But is it ever found?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes; one day it comes,\" he answered.\n\n\"And this is what you have understood,\" said the councillor.\n\n\"You, farmers, agricultural labourers! you pacific pioneers of a work\nthat belongs wholly to civilization! you, men of progress and morality,\nyou have understood, I say, that political storms are even more\nredoubtable than atmospheric disturbances!\"\n\n\"It comes one day,\" repeated Rodolphe, \"one day suddenly, and when\none is despairing of it. Then the horizon expands; it is as if a voice\ncried, 'It is here!' You feel the need of confiding the whole of your\nlife, of giving everything, sacrificing everything to this being. There\nis no need for explanations; they understand one another. They have seen\neach other in dreams!\"\n\n(And he looked at her.) \"In fine, here it is, this treasure so sought\nafter, here before you. It glitters, it flashes; yet one still doubts,\none does not believe it; one remains dazzled, as if one went out from\ndarkness into light.\"\n\nAnd as he ended Rodolphe suited the action to the word. He passed his\nhand over his face, like a man seized with giddiness. Then he let it\nfall on Emma's. She took hers away.\n\n\"And who would be surprised at it, gentlemen? He only who is so blind,\nso plunged (I do not fear to say it), so plunged in the prejudices\nof another age as still to misunderstand the spirit of agricultural\npopulations. Where, indeed, is to be found more patriotism than in the\ncountry, greater devotion to the public welfare, more intelligence, in a\nword? And, gentlemen, I do not mean that superficial intelligence,\nvain ornament of idle minds, but rather that profound and balanced\nintelligence that applies itself above all else to useful objects, thus\ncontributing to the good of all, to the common amelioration and to\nthe support of the state, born of respect for law and the practice of\nduty--\"\n\n\"Ah! again!\" said Rodolphe. \"Always 'duty.' I am sick of the word.\nThey are a lot of old blockheads in flannel vests and of old women with\nfoot-warmers and rosaries who constantly drone into our ears 'Duty,\nduty!' Ah! by Jove! one's duty is to feel what is great, cherish the\nbeautiful, and not accept all the conventions of society with the\nignominy that it imposes upon us.\"\n\n\"Yet--yet--\" objected Madame Bovary.\n\n\"No, no! Why cry out against the passions? Are they not the one\nbeautiful thing on the earth, the source of heroism, of enthusiasm, of\npoetry, music, the arts, of everything, in a word?\"\n\n\"But one must,\" said Emma, \"to some extent bow to the opinion of the\nworld and accept its moral code.\"\n\n\"Ah! but there are two,\" he replied. \"The small, the conventional, that\nof men, that which constantly changes, that brays out so loudly, that\nmakes such a commotion here below, of the earth earthly, like the mass\nof imbeciles you see down there. But the other, the eternal, that is\nabout us and above, like the landscape that surrounds us, and the blue\nheavens that give us light.\"\n\nMonsieur Lieuvain had just wiped his mouth with a pocket-handkerchief.\nHe continued--\n\n\"And what should I do here gentlemen, pointing out to you the uses\nof agriculture? Who supplies our wants? Who provides our means of\nsubsistence? Is it not the agriculturist? The agriculturist, gentlemen,\nwho, sowing with laborious hand the fertile furrows of the country,\nbrings forth the corn, which, being ground, is made into a powder by\nmeans of ingenious machinery, comes out thence under the name of flour,\nand from there, transported to our cities, is soon delivered at the\nbaker's, who makes it into food for poor and rich alike. Again, is it\nnot the agriculturist who fattens, for our clothes, his abundant\nflocks in the pastures? For how should we clothe ourselves, how nourish\nourselves, without the agriculturist? And, gentlemen, is it even\nnecessary to go so far for examples? Who has not frequently reflected\non all the momentous things that we get out of that modest animal, the\nornament of poultry-yards, that provides us at once with a soft pillow\nfor our bed, with succulent flesh for our tables, and eggs? But I should\nnever end if I were to enumerate one after the other all the different\nproducts which the earth, well cultivated, like a generous mother,\nlavishes upon her children. Here it is the vine, elsewhere the apple\ntree for cider, there colza, farther on cheeses and flax. Gentlemen, let\nus not forget flax, which has made such great strides of late years, and\nto which I will more particularly call your attention.\"\n\nHe had no need to call it, for all the mouths of the multitude were wide\nopen, as if to drink in his words. Tuvache by his side listened to him\nwith staring eyes. Monsieur Derozerays from time to time softly closed\nhis eyelids, and farther on the chemist, with his son Napoleon between\nhis knees, put his hand behind his ear in order not to lose a syllable.\nThe chins of the other members of the jury went slowly up and down in\ntheir waistcoats in sign of approval. The firemen at the foot of the\nplatform rested on their bayonets; and Binet, motionless, stood with\nout-turned elbows, the point of his sabre in the air. Perhaps he could\nhear, but certainly he could see nothing, because of the visor of his\nhelmet, that fell down on his nose. His lieutenant, the youngest son of\nMonsieur Tuvache, had a bigger one, for his was enormous, and shook on\nhis head, and from it an end of his cotton scarf peeped out. He smiled\nbeneath it with a perfectly infantine sweetness, and his pale little\nface, whence drops were running, wore an expression of enjoyment and\nsleepiness.\n\nThe square as far as the houses was crowded with people. One saw folk\nleaning on their elbows at all the windows, others standing at doors,\nand Justin, in front of the chemist's shop, seemed quite transfixed by\nthe sight of what he was looking at. In spite of the silence Monsieur\nLieuvain's voice was lost in the air. It reached you in fragments of\nphrases, and interrupted here and there by the creaking of chairs in the\ncrowd; then you suddenly heard the long bellowing of an ox, or else the\nbleating of the lambs, who answered one another at street corners. In\nfact, the cowherds and shepherds had driven their beasts thus far, and\nthese lowed from time to time, while with their tongues they tore down\nsome scrap of foliage that hung above their mouths.\n\nRodolphe had drawn nearer to Emma, and said to her in a low voice,\nspeaking rapidly--\n\n\"Does not this conspiracy of the world revolt you? Is there a single\nsentiment it does not condemn? The noblest instincts, the purest\nsympathies are persecuted, slandered; and if at length two poor souls do\nmeet, all is so organised that they cannot blend together. Yet they will\nmake the attempt; they will flutter their wings; they will call upon\neach other. Oh! no matter. Sooner or later, in six months, ten years,\nthey will come together, will love; for fate has decreed it, and they\nare born one for the other.\"\n\nHis arms were folded across his knees, and thus lifting his face towards\nEmma, close by her, he looked fixedly at her. She noticed in his eyes\nsmall golden lines radiating from black pupils; she even smelt the\nperfume of the pomade that made his hair glossy.\n\nThen a faintness came over her; she recalled the Viscount who had\nwaltzed with her at Vaubyessard, and his beard exhaled like this air an\nodour of vanilla and citron, and mechanically she half-closed her eyes\nthe better to breathe it in. But in making this movement, as she leant\nback in her chair, she saw in the distance, right on the line of the\nhorizon, the old diligence, the \"Hirondelle,\" that was slowly descending\nthe hill of Leux, dragging after it a long trail of dust. It was in this\nyellow carriage that Leon had so often come back to her, and by this\nroute down there that he had gone for ever. She fancied she saw him\nopposite at his windows; then all grew confused; clouds gathered; it\nseemed to her that she was again turning in the waltz under the light of\nthe lustres on the arm of the Viscount, and that Leon was not far away,\nthat he was coming; and yet all the time she was conscious of the scent\nof Rodolphe's head by her side. This sweetness of sensation pierced\nthrough her old desires, and these, like grains of sand under a gust\nof wind, eddied to and fro in the subtle breath of the perfume which\nsuffused her soul. She opened wide her nostrils several times to drink\nin the freshness of the ivy round the capitals. She took off her gloves,\nshe wiped her hands, then fanned her face with her handkerchief, while\nathwart the throbbing of her temples she heard the murmur of the\ncrowd and the voice of the councillor intoning his phrases. He\nsaid--\"Continue, persevere; listen neither to the suggestions of\nroutine, nor to the over-hasty councils of a rash empiricism.\n\n\"Apply yourselves, above all, to the amelioration of the soil, to good\nmanures, to the development of the equine, bovine, ovine, and porcine\nraces. Let these shows be to you pacific arenas, where the victor in\nleaving it will hold forth a hand to the vanquished, and will fraternise\nwith him in the hope of better success. And you, aged servants, humble\ndomestics, whose hard labour no Government up to this day has taken into\nconsideration, come hither to receive the reward of your silent virtues,\nand be assured that the state henceforward has its eye upon you; that it\nencourages you, protects you; that it will accede to your just\ndemands, and alleviate as much as in it lies the burden of your painful\nsacrifices.\"\n\nMonsieur Lieuvain then sat down; Monsieur Derozerays got up, beginning\nanother speech. His was not perhaps so florid as that of the councillor,\nbut it recommended itself by a more direct style, that is to say, by\nmore special knowledge and more elevated considerations. Thus the praise\nof the Government took up less space in it; religion and agriculture\nmore. He showed in it the relations of these two, and how they had\nalways contributed to civilisation. Rodolphe with Madame Bovary was\ntalking dreams, presentiments, magnetism. Going back to the cradle of\nsociety, the orator painted those fierce times when men lived on acorns\nin the heart of woods. Then they had left off the skins of beasts, had\nput on cloth, tilled the soil, planted the vine. Was this a good, and\nin this discovery was there not more of injury than of gain? Monsieur\nDerozerays set himself this problem. From magnetism little by little\nRodolphe had come to affinities, and while the president was citing\nCincinnatus and his plough, Diocletian, planting his cabbages, and the\nEmperors of China inaugurating the year by the sowing of seed, the\nyoung man was explaining to the young woman that these irresistible\nattractions find their cause in some previous state of existence.\n\n\"Thus we,\" he said, \"why did we come to know one another? What chance\nwilled it? It was because across the infinite, like two streams that\nflow but to unite; our special bents of mind had driven us towards each\nother.\"\n\nAnd he seized her hand; she did not withdraw it.\n\n\"For good farming generally!\" cried the president.\n\n\"Just now, for example, when I went to your house.\"\n\n\"To Monsieur Bizat of Quincampoix.\"\n\n\"Did I know I should accompany you?\"\n\n\"Seventy francs.\"\n\n\"A hundred times I wished to go; and I followed you--I remained.\"\n\n\"Manures!\"\n\n\"And I shall remain to-night, to-morrow, all other days, all my life!\"\n\n\"To Monsieur Caron of Argueil, a gold medal!\"\n\n\"For I have never in the society of any other person found so complete a\ncharm.\"\n\n\"To Monsieur Bain of Givry-Saint-Martin.\"\n\n\"And I shall carry away with me the remembrance of you.\"\n\n\"For a merino ram!\"\n\n\"But you will forget me; I shall pass away like a shadow.\"\n\n\"To Monsieur Belot of Notre-Dame.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I shall be something in your thought, in your life, shall I\nnot?\"\n\n\"Porcine race; prizes--equal, to Messrs. Leherisse and Cullembourg,\nsixty francs!\"\n\nRodolphe was pressing her hand, and he felt it all warm and quivering\nlike a captive dove that wants to fly away; but, whether she was trying\nto take it away or whether she was answering his pressure; she made a\nmovement with her fingers. He exclaimed--\n\n\"Oh, I thank you! You do not repulse me! You are good! You understand\nthat I am yours! Let me look at you; let me contemplate you!\"\n\nA gust of wind that blew in at the window ruffled the cloth on the\ntable, and in the square below all the great caps of the peasant women\nwere uplifted by it like the wings of white butterflies fluttering.\n\n\"Use of oil-cakes,\" continued the president. He was hurrying on:\n\"Flemish manure-flax-growing-drainage-long leases-domestic service.\"\n\nRodolphe was no longer speaking. They looked at one another. A supreme\ndesire made their dry lips tremble, and wearily, without an effort,\ntheir fingers intertwined.\n\n\"Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux, of Sassetot-la-Guerriere, for\nfifty-four years of service at the same farm, a silver medal--value,\ntwenty-five francs!\"\n\n\"Where is Catherine Leroux?\" repeated the councillor.\n\nShe did not present herself, and one could hear voices whispering--\n\n\"Go up!\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid!\"\n\n\"Oh, how stupid she is!\"\n\n\"Well, is she there?\" cried Tuvache.\n\n\"Yes; here she is.\"\n\n\"Then let her come up!\"\n\nThen there came forward on the platform a little old woman with timid\nbearing, who seemed to shrink within her poor clothes. On her feet she\nwore heavy wooden clogs, and from her hips hung a large blue apron. Her\npale face framed in a borderless cap was more wrinkled than a withered\nrusset apple. And from the sleeves of her red jacket looked out two\nlarge hands with knotty joints, the dust of barns, the potash of washing\nthe grease of wools had so encrusted, roughened, hardened these that\nthey seemed dirty, although they had been rinsed in clear water; and\nby dint of long service they remained half open, as if to bear humble\nwitness for themselves of so much suffering endured. Something of\nmonastic rigidity dignified her face. Nothing of sadness or of emotion\nweakened that pale look. In her constant living with animals she had\ncaught their dumbness and their calm. It was the first time that she\nfound herself in the midst of so large a company, and inwardly scared by\nthe flags, the drums, the gentlemen in frock-coats, and the order of the\ncouncillor, she stood motionless, not knowing whether to advance or run\naway, nor why the crowd was pushing her and the jury were smiling at\nher.\n\nThus stood before these radiant bourgeois this half-century of\nservitude.\n\n\"Approach, venerable Catherine Nicaise Elizabeth Leroux!\" said the\ncouncillor, who had taken the list of prize-winners from the president;\nand, looking at the piece of paper and the old woman by turns, he\nrepeated in a fatherly tone--\"Approach! approach!\"\n\n\"Are you deaf?\" said Tuvache, fidgeting in his armchair; and he began\nshouting in her ear, \"Fifty-four years of service. A silver medal!\nTwenty-five francs! For you!\"\n\nThen, when she had her medal, she looked at it, and a smile of beatitude\nspread over her face; and as she walked away they could hear her\nmuttering \"I'll give it to our cure up home, to say some masses for me!\"\n\n\"What fanaticism!\" exclaimed the chemist, leaning across to the notary.\n\nThe meeting was over, the crowd dispersed, and now that the speeches had\nbeen read, each one fell back into his place again, and everything into\nthe old grooves; the masters bullied the servants, and these struck the\nanimals, indolent victors, going back to the stalls, a green-crown on\ntheir horns.\n\nThe National Guards, however, had gone up to the first floor of the\ntown hall with buns spitted on their bayonets, and the drummer of the\nbattalion carried a basket with bottles. Madame Bovary took Rodolphe's\narm; he saw her home; they separated at her door; then he walked about\nalone in the meadow while he waited for the time of the banquet.\n\nThe feast was long, noisy, ill served; the guests were so crowded that\nthey could hardly move their elbows; and the narrow planks used for\nforms almost broke down under their weight. They ate hugely. Each one\nstuffed himself on his own account. Sweat stood on every brow, and a\nwhitish steam, like the vapour of a stream on an autumn morning, floated\nabove the table between the hanging lamps. Rodolphe, leaning against\nthe calico of the tent was thinking so earnestly of Emma that he heard\nnothing. Behind him on the grass the servants were piling up the dirty\nplates, his neighbours were talking; he did not answer them; they filled\nhis glass, and there was silence in his thoughts in spite of the growing\nnoise. He was dreaming of what she had said, of the line of her lips;\nher face, as in a magic mirror, shone on the plates of the shakos, the\nfolds of her gown fell along the walls, and days of love unrolled to all\ninfinity before him in the vistas of the future.\n\nHe saw her again in the evening during the fireworks, but she was with\nher husband, Madame Homais, and the druggist, who was worrying about the\ndanger of stray rockets, and every moment he left the company to go and\ngive some advice to Binet.\n\nThe pyrotechnic pieces sent to Monsieur Tuvache had, through an excess\nof caution, been shut up in his cellar, and so the damp powder would\nnot light, and the principal set piece, that was to represent a dragon\nbiting his tail, failed completely. Now and then a meagre Roman-candle\nwent off; then the gaping crowd sent up a shout that mingled with the\ncry of the women, whose waists were being squeezed in the darkness. Emma\nsilently nestled against Charles's shoulder; then, raising her chin, she\nwatched the luminous rays of the rockets against the dark sky. Rodolphe\ngazed at her in the light of the burning lanterns.\n\nThey went out one by one. The stars shone out. A few crops of rain began\nto fall. She knotted her fichu round her bare head.\n\nAt this moment the councillor's carriage came out from the inn.\n\nHis coachman, who was drunk, suddenly dozed off, and one could see from\nthe distance, above the hood, between the two lanterns, the mass of his\nbody, that swayed from right to left with the giving of the traces.\n\n\"Truly,\" said the druggist, \"one ought to proceed most rigorously\nagainst drunkenness! I should like to see written up weekly at the door\nof the town hall on a board ad hoc* the names of all those who during\nthe week got intoxicated on alcohol. Besides, with regard to statistics,\none would thus have, as it were, public records that one could refer to\nin case of need. But excuse me!\"\n\n     *Specifically for that.\n\nAnd he once more ran off to the captain. The latter was going back to\nsee his lathe again.\n\n\"Perhaps you would not do ill,\" Homais said to him, \"to send one of your\nmen, or to go yourself--\"\n\n\"Leave me alone!\" answered the tax-collector. \"It's all right!\"\n\n\"Do not be uneasy,\" said the druggist, when he returned to his friends.\n\"Monsieur Binet has assured me that all precautions have been taken. No\nsparks have fallen; the pumps are full. Let us go to rest.\"\n\n\"Ma foi! I want it,\" said Madame Homais, yawning at large. \"But never\nmind; we've had a beautiful day for our fete.\"\n\nRodolphe repeated in a low voice, and with a tender look, \"Oh, yes! very\nbeautiful!\"\n\nAnd having bowed to one another, they separated.\n\nTwo days later, in the \"Final de Rouen,\" there was a long article on the\nshow. Homais had composed it with verve the very next morning.\n\n\"Why these festoons, these flowers, these garlands? Whither hurries this\ncrowd like the waves of a furious sea under the torrents of a tropical\nsun pouring its heat upon our heads?\"\n\nThen he spoke of the condition of the peasants. Certainly the Government\nwas doing much, but not enough. \"Courage!\" he cried to it; \"a thousand\nreforms are indispensable; let us accomplish them!\" Then touching on\nthe entry of the councillor, he did not forget \"the martial air of our\nmilitia;\" nor \"our most merry village maidens;\" nor the \"bald-headed old\nmen like patriarchs who were there, and of whom some, the remnants of\nour phalanxes, still felt their hearts beat at the manly sound of the\ndrums.\" He cited himself among the first of the members of the jury,\nand he even called attention in a note to the fact that Monsieur Homais,\nchemist, had sent a memoir on cider to the agricultural society.\n\nWhen he came to the distribution of the prizes, he painted the joy of\nthe prize-winners in dithyrambic strophes. \"The father embraced the son,\nthe brother the brother, the husband his consort. More than one showed\nhis humble medal with pride; and no doubt when he got home to his good\nhousewife, he hung it up weeping on the modest walls of his cot.\n\n\"About six o'clock a banquet prepared in the meadow of Monsieur Leigeard\nbrought together the principal personages of the fete. The greatest\ncordiality reigned here. Divers toasts were proposed: Monsieur\nLieuvain, the King; Monsieur Tuvache, the Prefect; Monsieur Derozerays,\nAgriculture; Monsieur Homais, Industry and the Fine Arts, those twin\nsisters; Monsieur Leplichey, Progress. In the evening some brilliant\nfireworks on a sudden illumined the air. One would have called it a\nveritable kaleidoscope, a real operatic scene; and for a moment our\nlittle locality might have thought itself transported into the midst of\na dream of the 'Thousand and One Nights.' Let us state that no untoward\nevent disturbed this family meeting.\" And he added \"Only the absence\nof the clergy was remarked. No doubt the priests understand progress in\nanother fashion. Just as you please, messieurs the followers of Loyola!\"\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\n\nSix weeks passed. Rodolphe did not come again. At last one evening he\nappeared.\n\nThe day after the show he had said to himself--\"We mustn't go back too\nsoon; that would be a mistake.\"\n\nAnd at the end of a week he had gone off hunting. After the hunting he\nhad thought it was too late, and then he reasoned thus--\n\n\"If from the first day she loved me, she must from impatience to see me\nagain love me more. Let's go on with it!\"\n\nAnd he knew that his calculation had been right when, on entering the\nroom, he saw Emma turn pale.\n\nShe was alone. The day was drawing in. The small muslin curtain along\nthe windows deepened the twilight, and the gilding of the barometer, on\nwhich the rays of the sun fell, shone in the looking-glass between the\nmeshes of the coral.\n\nRodolphe remained standing, and Emma hardly answered his first\nconventional phrases.\n\n\"I,\" he said, \"have been busy. I have been ill.\"\n\n\"Seriously?\" she cried.\n\n\"Well,\" said Rodolphe, sitting down at her side on a footstool, \"no; it\nwas because I did not want to come back.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Can you not guess?\"\n\nHe looked at her again, but so hard that she lowered her head, blushing.\nHe went on--\n\n\"Emma!\"\n\n\"Sir,\" she said, drawing back a little.\n\n\"Ah! you see,\" replied he in a melancholy voice, \"that I was right not\nto come back; for this name, this name that fills my whole soul, and\nthat escaped me, you forbid me to use! Madame Bovary! why all the\nworld calls you thus! Besides, it is not your name; it is the name of\nanother!\"\n\nHe repeated, \"of another!\" And he hid his face in his hands.\n\n\"Yes, I think of you constantly. The memory of you drives me to despair.\nAh! forgive me! I will leave you! Farewell! I will go far away, so far\nthat you will never hear of me again; and yet--to-day--I know not what\nforce impelled me towards you. For one does not struggle against Heaven;\none cannot resist the smile of angels; one is carried away by that which\nis beautiful, charming, adorable.\"\n\nIt was the first time that Emma had heard such words spoken to herself,\nand her pride, like one who reposes bathed in warmth, expanded softly\nand fully at this glowing language.\n\n\"But if I did not come,\" he continued, \"if I could not see you, at least\nI have gazed long on all that surrounds you. At night-every night-I\narose; I came hither; I watched your house, its glimmering in the moon,\nthe trees in the garden swaying before your window, and the little lamp,\na gleam shining through the window-panes in the darkness. Ah! you never\nknew that there, so near you, so far from you, was a poor wretch!\"\n\nShe turned towards him with a sob.\n\n\"Oh, you are good!\" she said.\n\n\"No, I love you, that is all! You do not doubt that! Tell me--one\nword--only one word!\"\n\nAnd Rodolphe imperceptibly glided from the footstool to the ground; but\na sound of wooden shoes was heard in the kitchen, and he noticed the\ndoor of the room was not closed.\n\n\"How kind it would be of you,\" he went on, rising, \"if you would humour\na whim of mine.\" It was to go over her house; he wanted to know it; and\nMadame Bovary seeing no objection to this, they both rose, when Charles\ncame in.\n\n\"Good morning, doctor,\" Rodolphe said to him.\n\nThe doctor, flattered at this unexpected title, launched out into\nobsequious phrases. Of this the other took advantage to pull himself\ntogether a little.\n\n\"Madame was speaking to me,\" he then said, \"about her health.\"\n\nCharles interrupted him; he had indeed a thousand anxieties; his wife's\npalpitations of the heart were beginning again. Then Rodolphe asked if\nriding would not be good.\n\n\"Certainly! excellent! just the thing! There's an idea! You ought to\nfollow it up.\"\n\nAnd as she objected that she had no horse, Monsieur Rodolphe offered\none. She refused his offer; he did not insist. Then to explain his visit\nhe said that his ploughman, the man of the blood-letting, still suffered\nfrom giddiness.\n\n\"I'll call around,\" said Bovary.\n\n\"No, no! I'll send him to you; we'll come; that will be more convenient\nfor you.\"\n\n\"Ah! very good! I thank you.\"\n\nAnd as soon as they were alone, \"Why don't you accept Monsieur\nBoulanger's kind offer?\"\n\nShe assumed a sulky air, invented a thousand excuses, and finally\ndeclared that perhaps it would look odd.\n\n\"Well, what the deuce do I care for that?\" said Charles, making a\npirouette. \"Health before everything! You are wrong.\"\n\n\"And how do you think I can ride when I haven't got a habit?\"\n\n\"You must order one,\" he answered.\n\nThe riding-habit decided her.\n\nWhen the habit was ready, Charles wrote to Monsieur Boulanger that his\nwife was at his command, and that they counted on his good-nature.\n\nThe next day at noon Rodolphe appeared at Charles's door with two\nsaddle-horses. One had pink rosettes at his ears and a deerskin\nside-saddle.\n\nRodolphe had put on high soft boots, saying to himself that no doubt she\nhad never seen anything like them. In fact, Emma was charmed with his\nappearance as he stood on the landing in his great velvet coat and white\ncorduroy breeches. She was ready; she was waiting for him.\n\nJustin escaped from the chemist's to see her start, and the chemist also\ncame out. He was giving Monsieur Boulanger a little good advice.\n\n\"An accident happens so easily. Be careful! Your horses perhaps are\nmettlesome.\"\n\nShe heard a noise above her; it was Felicite drumming on the windowpanes\nto amuse little Berthe. The child blew her a kiss; her mother answered\nwith a wave of her whip.\n\n\"A pleasant ride!\" cried Monsieur Homais. \"Prudence! above all,\nprudence!\" And he flourished his newspaper as he saw them disappear.\n\nAs soon as he felt the ground, Emma's horse set off at a gallop.\n\nRodolphe galloped by her side. Now and then they exchanged a word. Her\nfigure slightly bent, her hand well up, and her right arm stretched out,\nshe gave herself up to the cadence of the movement that rocked her in\nher saddle. At the bottom of the hill Rodolphe gave his horse its head;\nthey started together at a bound, then at the top suddenly the horses\nstopped, and her large blue veil fell about her.\n\nIt was early in October. There was fog over the land. Hazy clouds\nhovered on the horizon between the outlines of the hills; others, rent\nasunder, floated up and disappeared. Sometimes through a rift in the\nclouds, beneath a ray of sunshine, gleamed from afar the roots of\nYonville, with the gardens at the water's edge, the yards, the walls and\nthe church steeple. Emma half closed her eyes to pick out her house, and\nnever had this poor village where she lived appeared so small. From the\nheight on which they were the whole valley seemed an immense pale lake\nsending off its vapour into the air. Clumps of trees here and there\nstood out like black rocks, and the tall lines of the poplars that rose\nabove the mist were like a beach stirred by the wind.\n\nBy the side, on the turf between the pines, a brown light shimmered\nin the warm atmosphere. The earth, ruddy like the powder of tobacco,\ndeadened the noise of their steps, and with the edge of their shoes the\nhorses as they walked kicked the fallen fir cones in front of them.\n\nRodolphe and Emma thus went along the skirt of the wood. She turned\naway from time to time to avoid his look, and then she saw only the pine\ntrunks in lines, whose monotonous succession made her a little giddy.\nThe horses were panting; the leather of the saddles creaked.\n\nJust as they were entering the forest the sun shone out.\n\n\"God protects us!\" said Rodolphe.\n\n\"Do you think so?\" she said.\n\n\"Forward! forward!\" he continued.\n\nHe \"tchk'd\" with his tongue. The two beasts set off at a trot.\n\nLong ferns by the roadside caught in Emma's stirrup.\n\nRodolphe leant forward and removed them as they rode along. At other\ntimes, to turn aside the branches, he passed close to her, and Emma felt\nhis knee brushing against her leg. The sky was now blue, the leaves no\nlonger stirred. There were spaces full of heather in flower, and plots\nof violets alternated with the confused patches of the trees that were\ngrey, fawn, or golden coloured, according to the nature of their leaves.\nOften in the thicket was heard the fluttering of wings, or else the\nhoarse, soft cry of the ravens flying off amidst the oaks.\n\nThey dismounted. Rodolphe fastened up the horses. She walked on in\nfront on the moss between the paths. But her long habit got in her way,\nalthough she held it up by the skirt; and Rodolphe, walking behind her,\nsaw between the black cloth and the black shoe the fineness of her white\nstocking, that seemed to him as if it were a part of her nakedness.\n\nShe stopped. \"I am tired,\" she said.\n\n\"Come, try again,\" he went on. \"Courage!\"\n\nThen some hundred paces farther on she again stopped, and through her\nveil, that fell sideways from her man's hat over her hips, her face\nappeared in a bluish transparency as if she were floating under azure\nwaves.\n\n\"But where are we going?\"\n\nHe did not answer. She was breathing irregularly. Rodolphe looked round\nhim biting his moustache. They came to a larger space where the coppice\nhad been cut. They sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and Rodolphe\nbegan speaking to her of his love. He did not begin by frightening her\nwith compliments. He was calm, serious, melancholy.\n\nEmma listened to him with bowed head, and stirred the bits of wood on\nthe ground with the tip of her foot. But at the words, \"Are not our\ndestinies now one?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" she replied. \"You know that well. It is impossible!\" She rose\nto go. He seized her by the wrist. She stopped. Then, having gazed\nat him for a few moments with an amorous and humid look, she said\nhurriedly--\n\n\"Ah! do not speak of it again! Where are the horses? Let us go back.\"\n\nHe made a gesture of anger and annoyance. She repeated:\n\n\"Where are the horses? Where are the horses?\"\n\nThen smiling a strange smile, his pupil fixed, his teeth set, he\nadvanced with outstretched arms. She recoiled trembling. She stammered:\n\n\"Oh, you frighten me! You hurt me! Let me go!\"\n\n\"If it must be,\" he went on, his face changing; and he again became\nrespectful, caressing, timid. She gave him her arm. They went back. He\nsaid--\n\n\"What was the matter with you? Why? I do not understand. You were\nmistaken, no doubt. In my soul you are as a Madonna on a pedestal, in\na place lofty, secure, immaculate. But I need you to live! I must have\nyour eyes, your voice, your thought! Be my friend, my sister, my angel!\"\n\nAnd he put out his arm round her waist. She feebly tried to disengage\nherself. He supported her thus as they walked along.\n\nBut they heard the two horses browsing on the leaves.\n\n\"Oh! one moment!\" said Rodolphe. \"Do not let us go! Stay!\"\n\nHe drew her farther on to a small pool where duckweeds made a greenness\non the water. Faded water lilies lay motionless between the reeds.\nAt the noise of their steps in the grass, frogs jumped away to hide\nthemselves.\n\n\"I am wrong! I am wrong!\" she said. \"I am mad to listen to you!\"\n\n\"Why? Emma! Emma!\"\n\n\"Oh, Rodolphe!\" said the young woman slowly, leaning on his shoulder.\n\nThe cloth of her habit caught against the velvet of his coat. She threw\nback her white neck, swelling with a sigh, and faltering, in tears, with\na long shudder and hiding her face, she gave herself up to him--\n\nThe shades of night were falling; the horizontal sun passing between the\nbranches dazzled the eyes. Here and there around her, in the leaves\nor on the ground, trembled luminous patches, as it hummingbirds flying\nabout had scattered their feathers. Silence was everywhere; something\nsweet seemed to come forth from the trees; she felt her heart, whose\nbeating had begun again, and the blood coursing through her flesh like a\nstream of milk. Then far away, beyond the wood, on the other hills, she\nheard a vague prolonged cry, a voice which lingered, and in silence she\nheard it mingling like music with the last pulsations of her throbbing\nnerves. Rodolphe, a cigar between his lips, was mending with his\npenknife one of the two broken bridles.\n\nThey returned to Yonville by the same road. On the mud they saw again\nthe traces of their horses side by side, the same thickets, the same\nstones to the grass; nothing around them seemed changed; and yet for her\nsomething had happened more stupendous than if the mountains had moved\nin their places. Rodolphe now and again bent forward and took her hand\nto kiss it.\n\nShe was charming on horseback--upright, with her slender waist, her knee\nbent on the mane of her horse, her face somewhat flushed by the fresh\nair in the red of the evening.\n\nOn entering Yonville she made her horse prance in the road. People\nlooked at her from the windows.\n\nAt dinner her husband thought she looked well, but she pretended not to\nhear him when he inquired about her ride, and she remained sitting there\nwith her elbow at the side of her plate between the two lighted candles.\n\n\"Emma!\" he said.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Well, I spent the afternoon at Monsieur Alexandre's. He has an old cob,\nstill very fine, only a little broken-kneed, and that could be bought; I\nam sure, for a hundred crowns.\" He added, \"And thinking it might please\nyou, I have bespoken it--bought it. Have I done right? Do tell me?\"\n\nShe nodded her head in assent; then a quarter of an hour later--\n\n\"Are you going out to-night?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing, my dear!\"\n\nAnd as soon as she had got rid of Charles she went and shut herself up\nin her room.\n\nAt first she felt stunned; she saw the trees, the paths, the ditches,\nRodolphe, and she again felt the pressure of his arm, while the leaves\nrustled and the reeds whistled.\n\nBut when she saw herself in the glass she wondered at her face. Never\nhad her eyes been so large, so black, of so profound a depth. Something\nsubtle about her being transfigured her. She repeated, \"I have a lover!\na lover!\" delighting at the idea as if a second puberty had come to her.\nSo at last she was to know those joys of love, that fever of happiness\nof which she had despaired! She was entering upon marvels where all\nwould be passion, ecstasy, delirium. An azure infinity encompassed\nher, the heights of sentiment sparkled under her thought, and ordinary\nexistence appeared only afar off, down below in the shade, through the\ninterspaces of these heights.\n\nThen she recalled the heroines of the books that she had read, and the\nlyric legion of these adulterous women began to sing in her memory with\nthe voice of sisters that charmed her. She became herself, as it were,\nan actual part of these imaginings, and realised the love-dream of her\nyouth as she saw herself in this type of amorous women whom she had\nso envied. Besides, Emma felt a satisfaction of revenge. Had she not\nsuffered enough? But now she triumphed, and the love so long pent up\nburst forth in full joyous bubblings. She tasted it without remorse,\nwithout anxiety, without trouble.\n\nThe day following passed with a new sweetness. They made vows to one\nanother She told him of her sorrows. Rodolphe interrupted her with\nkisses; and she looking at him through half-closed eyes, asked him to\ncall her again by her name--to say that he loved her They were in the\nforest, as yesterday, in the shed of some woodenshoe maker. The walls\nwere of straw, and the roof so low they had to stoop. They were seated\nside by side on a bed of dry leaves.\n\nFrom that day forth they wrote to one another regularly every evening.\nEmma placed her letter at the end of the garden, by the river, in a\nfissure of the wall. Rodolphe came to fetch it, and put another there,\nthat she always found fault with as too short.\n\nOne morning, when Charles had gone out before day break, she was seized\nwith the fancy to see Rodolphe at once. She would go quickly to La\nHuchette, stay there an hour, and be back again at Yonville while\neveryone was still asleep. This idea made her pant with desire, and she\nsoon found herself in the middle of the field, walking with rapid steps,\nwithout looking behind her.\n\nDay was just breaking. Emma from afar recognised her lover's house. Its\ntwo dove-tailed weathercocks stood out black against the pale dawn.\n\nBeyond the farmyard there was a detached building that she thought must\nbe the chateau She entered--it was if the doors at her approach had\nopened wide of their own accord. A large straight staircase led up to\nthe corridor. Emma raised the latch of a door, and suddenly at the end\nof the room she saw a man sleeping. It was Rodolphe. She uttered a cry.\n\n\"You here? You here?\" he repeated. \"How did you manage to come? Ah! your\ndress is damp.\"\n\n\"I love you,\" she answered, throwing her arms about his neck.\n\nThis first piece of daring successful, now every time Charles went out\nearly Emma dressed quickly and slipped on tiptoe down the steps that led\nto the waterside.\n\nBut when the plank for the cows was taken up, she had to go by the walls\nalongside of the river; the bank was slippery; in order not to fall\nshe caught hold of the tufts of faded wallflowers. Then she went across\nploughed fields, in which she sank, stumbling; and clogging her thin\nshoes. Her scarf, knotted round her head, fluttered to the wind in the\nmeadows. She was afraid of the oxen; she began to run; she arrived out\nof breath, with rosy cheeks, and breathing out from her whole person a\nfresh perfume of sap, of verdure, of the open air. At this hour Rodolphe\nstill slept. It was like a spring morning coming into his room.\n\nThe yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light enter\nsoftly. Emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while the drops\nof dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around\nher face. Rodolphe, laughing, drew her to him, and pressed her to his\nbreast.\n\nThen she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables,\ncombed her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in his\nshaving-glass. Often she even put between her teeth the big pipe that\nlay on the table by the bed, amongst lemons and pieces of sugar near a\nbottle of water.\n\nIt took them a good quarter of an hour to say goodbye. Then Emma cried.\nShe would have wished never to leave Rodolphe. Something stronger than\nherself forced her to him; so much so, that one day, seeing her come\nunexpectedly, he frowned as one put out.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she said. \"Are you ill? Tell me!\"\n\nAt last he declared with a serious air that her visits were becoming\nimprudent--that she was compromising herself.\n\n\n\nChapter Ten\n\nGradually Rodolphe's fears took possession of her. At first, love had\nintoxicated her; and she had thought of nothing beyond. But now that he\nwas indispensable to her life, she feared to lose anything of this, or\neven that it should be disturbed. When she came back from his house she\nlooked all about her, anxiously watching every form that passed in the\nhorizon, and every village window from which she could be seen. She\nlistened for steps, cries, the noise of the ploughs, and she stopped\nshort, white, and trembling more than the aspen leaves swaying overhead.\n\nOne morning as she was thus returning, she suddenly thought she saw the\nlong barrel of a carbine that seemed to be aimed at her. It stuck out\nsideways from the end of a small tub half-buried in the grass on the\nedge of a ditch. Emma, half-fainting with terror, nevertheless walked\non, and a man stepped out of the tub like a Jack-in-the-box. He had\ngaiters buckled up to the knees, his cap pulled down over his eyes,\ntrembling lips, and a red nose. It was Captain Binet lying in ambush for\nwild ducks.\n\n\"You ought to have called out long ago!\" he exclaimed; \"When one sees a\ngun, one should always give warning.\"\n\nThe tax-collector was thus trying to hide the fright he had had, for\na prefectorial order having prohibited duckhunting except in boats,\nMonsieur Binet, despite his respect for the laws, was infringing them,\nand so he every moment expected to see the rural guard turn up. But\nthis anxiety whetted his pleasure, and, all alone in his tub, he\ncongratulated himself on his luck and on his cuteness. At sight of\nEmma he seemed relieved from a great weight, and at once entered upon a\nconversation.\n\n\"It isn't warm; it's nipping.\"\n\nEmma answered nothing. He went on--\n\n\"And you're out so early?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said stammering; \"I am just coming from the nurse where my\nchild is.\"\n\n\"Ah! very good! very good! For myself, I am here, just as you see me,\nsince break of day; but the weather is so muggy, that unless one had the\nbird at the mouth of the gun--\"\n\n\"Good evening, Monsieur Binet,\" she interrupted him, turning on her\nheel.\n\n\"Your servant, madame,\" he replied drily; and he went back into his tub.\n\nEmma regretted having left the tax-collector so abruptly. No doubt he\nwould form unfavourable conjectures. The story about the nurse was the\nworst possible excuse, everyone at Yonville knowing that the little\nBovary had been at home with her parents for a year. Besides, no one\nwas living in this direction; this path led only to La Huchette. Binet,\nthen, would guess whence she came, and he would not keep silence; he\nwould talk, that was certain. She remained until evening racking her\nbrain with every conceivable lying project, and had constantly before\nher eyes that imbecile with the game-bag.\n\nCharles after dinner, seeing her gloomy, proposed, by way of\ndistraction, to take her to the chemist's, and the first person she\ncaught sight of in the shop was the taxcollector again. He was standing\nin front of the counter, lit up by the gleams of the red bottle, and was\nsaying--\n\n\"Please give me half an ounce of vitriol.\"\n\n\"Justin,\" cried the druggist, \"bring us the sulphuric acid.\" Then to\nEmma, who was going up to Madame Homais' room, \"No, stay here; it isn't\nworth while going up; she is just coming down. Warm yourself at the\nstove in the meantime. Excuse me. Good-day, doctor,\" (for the chemist\nmuch enjoyed pronouncing the word \"doctor,\" as if addressing another by\nit reflected on himself some of the grandeur that he found in it). \"Now,\ntake care not to upset the mortars! You'd better fetch some chairs from\nthe little room; you know very well that the arm-chairs are not to be\ntaken out of the drawing-room.\"\n\nAnd to put his arm-chair back in its place he was darting away from the\ncounter, when Binet asked him for half an ounce of sugar acid.\n\n\"Sugar acid!\" said the chemist contemptuously, \"don't know it; I'm\nignorant of it! But perhaps you want oxalic acid. It is oxalic acid,\nisn't it?\"\n\nBinet explained that he wanted a corrosive to make himself some\ncopperwater with which to remove rust from his hunting things.\n\nEmma shuddered. The chemist began saying--\n\n\"Indeed the weather is not propitious on account of the damp.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless,\" replied the tax-collector, with a sly look, \"there are\npeople who like it.\"\n\nShe was stifling.\n\n\"And give me--\"\n\n\"Will he never go?\" thought she.\n\n\"Half an ounce of resin and turpentine, four ounces of yellow wax,\nand three half ounces of animal charcoal, if you please, to clean the\nvarnished leather of my togs.\"\n\nThe druggist was beginning to cut the wax when Madame Homais appeared,\nIrma in her arms, Napoleon by her side, and Athalie following. She sat\ndown on the velvet seat by the window, and the lad squatted down on a\nfootstool, while his eldest sister hovered round the jujube box near\nher papa. The latter was filling funnels and corking phials, sticking on\nlabels, making up parcels. Around him all were silent; only from time\nto time, were heard the weights jingling in the balance, and a few low\nwords from the chemist giving directions to his pupil.\n\n\"And how's the little woman?\" suddenly asked Madame Homais.\n\n\"Silence!\" exclaimed her husband, who was writing down some figures in\nhis waste-book.\n\n\"Why didn't you bring her?\" she went on in a low voice.\n\n\"Hush! hush!\" said Emma, pointing with her finger to the druggist.\n\nBut Binet, quite absorbed in looking over his bill, had probably heard\nnothing. At last he went out. Then Emma, relieved, uttered a deep sigh.\n\n\"How hard you are breathing!\" said Madame Homais.\n\n\"Well, you see, it's rather warm,\" she replied.\n\nSo the next day they talked over how to arrange their rendezvous. Emma\nwanted to bribe her servant with a present, but it would be better to\nfind some safe house at Yonville. Rodolphe promised to look for one.\n\nAll through the winter, three or four times a week, in the dead of night\nhe came to the garden. Emma had on purpose taken away the key of the\ngate, which Charles thought lost.\n\nTo call her, Rodolphe threw a sprinkle of sand at the shutters. She\njumped up with a start; but sometimes he had to wait, for Charles had a\nmania for chatting by the fireside, and he would not stop. She was wild\nwith impatience; if her eyes could have done it, she would have hurled\nhim out at the window. At last she would begin to undress, then take up\na book, and go on reading very quietly as if the book amused her. But\nCharles, who was in bed, called to her to come too.\n\n\"Come, now, Emma,\" he said, \"it is time.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am coming,\" she answered.\n\nThen, as the candles dazzled him; he turned to the wall and fell asleep.\nShe escaped, smiling, palpitating, undressed. Rodolphe had a large\ncloak; he wrapped her in it, and putting his arm round her waist, he\ndrew her without a word to the end of the garden.\n\nIt was in the arbour, on the same seat of old sticks where formerly Leon\nhad looked at her so amorously on the summer evenings. She never thought\nof him now.\n\nThe stars shone through the leafless jasmine branches. Behind them they\nheard the river flowing, and now and again on the bank the rustling\nof the dry reeds. Masses of shadow here and there loomed out in the\ndarkness, and sometimes, vibrating with one movement, they rose up and\nswayed like immense black waves pressing forward to engulf them. The\ncold of the nights made them clasp closer; the sighs of their lips\nseemed to them deeper; their eyes that they could hardly see, larger;\nand in the midst of the silence low words were spoken that fell on\ntheir souls sonorous, crystalline, and that reverberated in multiplied\nvibrations.\n\nWhen the night was rainy, they took refuge in the consulting-room\nbetween the cart-shed and the stable. She lighted one of the kitchen\ncandles that she had hidden behind the books. Rodolphe settled down\nthere as if at home. The sight of the library, of the bureau, of the\nwhole apartment, in fine, excited his merriment, and he could not\nrefrain from making jokes about Charles, which rather embarrassed Emma.\nShe would have liked to see him more serious, and even on occasions\nmore dramatic; as, for example, when she thought she heard a noise of\napproaching steps in the alley.\n\n\"Someone is coming!\" she said.\n\nHe blew out the light.\n\n\"Have you your pistols?\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why, to defend yourself,\" replied Emma.\n\n\"From your husband? Oh, poor devil!\" And Rodolphe finished his sentence\nwith a gesture that said, \"I could crush him with a flip of my finger.\"\n\nShe was wonder-stricken at his bravery, although she felt in it a sort\nof indecency and a naive coarseness that scandalised her.\n\nRodolphe reflected a good deal on the affair of the pistols. If she had\nspoken seriously, it was very ridiculous, he thought, even odious; for\nhe had no reason to hate the good Charles, not being what is called\ndevoured by jealousy; and on this subject Emma had taken a great vow\nthat he did not think in the best of taste.\n\nBesides, she was growing very sentimental. She had insisted on\nexchanging miniatures; they had cut off handfuls of hair, and now she\nwas asking for a ring--a real wedding-ring, in sign of an eternal union.\nShe often spoke to him of the evening chimes, of the voices of nature.\nThen she talked to him of her mother--hers! and of his mother--his!\nRodolphe had lost his twenty years ago. Emma none the less consoled\nhim with caressing words as one would have done a lost child, and she\nsometimes even said to him, gazing at the moon--\n\n\"I am sure that above there together they approve of our love.\"\n\nBut she was so pretty. He had possessed so few women of such\ningenuousness. This love without debauchery was a new experience for\nhim, and, drawing him out of his lazy habits, caressed at once his pride\nand his sensuality. Emma's enthusiasm, which his bourgeois good sense\ndisdained, seemed to him in his heart of hearts charming, since it\nwas lavished on him. Then, sure of being loved, he no longer kept up\nappearances, and insensibly his ways changed.\n\nHe had no longer, as formerly, words so gentle that they made her cry,\nnor passionate caresses that made her mad, so that their great love,\nwhich engrossed her life, seemed to lessen beneath her like the water of\na stream absorbed into its channel, and she could see the bed of it.\nShe would not believe it; she redoubled in tenderness, and Rodolphe\nconcealed his indifference less and less.\n\nShe did not know if she regretted having yielded to him, or whether she\ndid not wish, on the contrary, to enjoy him the more. The humiliation\nof feeling herself weak was turning to rancour, tempered by their\nvoluptuous pleasures. It was not affection; it was like a continual\nseduction. He subjugated her; she almost feared him.\n\nAppearances, nevertheless, were calmer than ever, Rodolphe having\nsucceeded in carrying out the adultery after his own fancy; and at the\nend of six months, when the spring-time came, they were to one another\nlike a married couple, tranquilly keeping up a domestic flame.\n\nIt was the time of year when old Rouault sent his turkey in remembrance\nof the setting of his leg. The present always arrived with a letter.\nEmma cut the string that tied it to the basket, and read the following\nlines:--\n\n\"My Dear Children--I hope this will find you well, and that this one\nwill be as good as the others. For it seems to me a little more tender,\nif I may venture to say so, and heavier. But next time, for a change,\nI'll give you a turkeycock, unless you have a preference for some dabs;\nand send me back the hamper, if you please, with the two old ones. I\nhave had an accident with my cart-sheds, whose covering flew off one\nwindy night among the trees. The harvest has not been overgood either.\nFinally, I don't know when I shall come to see you. It is so difficult\nnow to leave the house since I am alone, my poor Emma.\"\n\nHere there was a break in the lines, as if the old fellow had dropped\nhis pen to dream a little while.\n\n\"For myself, I am very well, except for a cold I caught the other day at\nthe fair at Yvetot, where I had gone to hire a shepherd, having turned\naway mine because he was too dainty. How we are to be pitied with such\na lot of thieves! Besides, he was also rude. I heard from a pedlar, who,\ntravelling through your part of the country this winter, had a tooth\ndrawn, that Bovary was as usual working hard. That doesn't surprise me;\nand he showed me his tooth; we had some coffee together. I asked him if\nhe had seen you, and he said not, but that he had seen two horses in the\nstables, from which I conclude that business is looking up. So much\nthe better, my dear children, and may God send you every imaginable\nhappiness! It grieves me not yet to have seen my dear little\ngrand-daughter, Berthe Bovary. I have planted an Orleans plum-tree for\nher in the garden under your room, and I won't have it touched unless it\nis to have jam made for her by and bye, that I will keep in the cupboard\nfor her when she comes.\n\n\"Good-bye, my dear children. I kiss you, my girl, you too, my\nson-in-law, and the little one on both cheeks. I am, with best\ncompliments, your loving father.\n\n\"Theodore Rouault.\"\n\nShe held the coarse paper in her fingers for some minutes. The spelling\nmistakes were interwoven one with the other, and Emma followed the\nkindly thought that cackled right through it like a hen half hidden\nin the hedge of thorns. The writing had been dried with ashes from\nthe hearth, for a little grey powder slipped from the letter on to her\ndress, and she almost thought she saw her father bending over the hearth\nto take up the tongs. How long since she had been with him, sitting on\nthe footstool in the chimney-corner, where she used to burn the end of\na bit of wood in the great flame of the sea-sedges! She remembered the\nsummer evenings all full of sunshine. The colts neighed when anyone\npassed by, and galloped, galloped. Under her window there was a beehive,\nand sometimes the bees wheeling round in the light struck against her\nwindow like rebounding balls of gold. What happiness there had been\nat that time, what freedom, what hope! What an abundance of illusions!\nNothing was left of them now. She had got rid of them all in her soul's\nlife, in all her successive conditions of life, maidenhood, her marriage,\nand her love--thus constantly losing them all her life through, like\na traveller who leaves something of his wealth at every inn along his\nroad.\n\nBut what then, made her so unhappy? What was the extraordinary\ncatastrophe that had transformed her? And she raised her head, looking\nround as if to seek the cause of that which made her suffer.\n\nAn April ray was dancing on the china of the whatnot; the fire burned;\nbeneath her slippers she felt the softness of the carpet; the day was\nbright, the air warm, and she heard her child shouting with laughter.\n\nIn fact, the little girl was just then rolling on the lawn in the midst\nof the grass that was being turned. She was lying flat on her stomach\nat the top of a rick. The servant was holding her by her skirt.\nLestiboudois was raking by her side, and every time he came near she\nlent forward, beating the air with both her arms.\n\n\"Bring her to me,\" said her mother, rushing to embrace her. \"How I love\nyou, my poor child! How I love you!\"\n\nThen noticing that the tips of her ears were rather dirty, she rang at\nonce for warm water, and washed her, changed her linen, her stockings,\nher shoes, asked a thousand questions about her health, as if on the\nreturn from a long journey, and finally, kissing her again and crying\na little, she gave her back to the servant, who stood quite\nthunderstricken at this excess of tenderness.\n\nThat evening Rodolphe found her more serious than usual.\n\n\"That will pass over,\" he concluded; \"it's a whim:\"\n\nAnd he missed three rendezvous running. When he did come, she showed\nherself cold and almost contemptuous.\n\n\"Ah! you're losing your time, my lady!\"\n\nAnd he pretended not to notice her melancholy sighs, nor the\nhandkerchief she took out.\n\nThen Emma repented. She even asked herself why she detested Charles; if\nit had not been better to have been able to love him? But he gave her\nno opportunities for such a revival of sentiment, so that she was much\nembarrassed by her desire for sacrifice, when the druggist came just in\ntime to provide her with an opportunity.\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven\n\nHe had recently read a eulogy on a new method for curing club-foot, and\nas he was a partisan of progress, he conceived the patriotic idea that\nYonville, in order to keep to the fore, ought to have some operations\nfor strephopody or club-foot.\n\n\"For,\" said he to Emma, \"what risk is there? See--\" (and he enumerated\non his fingers the advantages of the attempt), \"success, almost certain\nrelief and beautifying of the patient, celebrity acquired by the\noperator. Why, for example, should not your husband relieve poor\nHippolyte of the 'Lion d'Or'? Note that he would not fail to tell about\nhis cure to all the travellers, and then\" (Homais lowered his voice and\nlooked round him) \"who is to prevent me from sending a short paragraph\non the subject to the paper? Eh! goodness me! an article gets about; it\nis talked of; it ends by making a snowball! And who knows? who knows?\"\n\nIn fact, Bovary might succeed. Nothing proved to Emma that he was not\nclever; and what a satisfaction for her to have urged him to a step by\nwhich his reputation and fortune would be increased! She only wished to\nlean on something more solid than love.\n\nCharles, urged by the druggist and by her, allowed himself to be\npersuaded. He sent to Rouen for Dr. Duval's volume, and every evening,\nholding his head between both hands, plunged into the reading of it.\n\nWhile he was studying equinus, varus, and valgus, that is to say,\nkatastrephopody, endostrephopody, and exostrephopody (or better, the\nvarious turnings of the foot downwards, inwards, and outwards, with the\nhypostrephopody and anastrephopody), otherwise torsion downwards and\nupwards, Monsier Homais, with all sorts of arguments, was exhorting the\nlad at the inn to submit to the operation.\n\n\"You will scarcely feel, probably, a slight pain; it is a simple prick,\nlike a little blood-letting, less than the extraction of certain corns.\"\n\nHippolyte, reflecting, rolled his stupid eyes.\n\n\"However,\" continued the chemist, \"it doesn't concern me. It's for your\nsake, for pure humanity! I should like to see you, my friend, rid of\nyour hideous caudication, together with that waddling of the lumbar\nregions which, whatever you say, must considerably interfere with you in\nthe exercise of your calling.\"\n\nThen Homais represented to him how much jollier and brisker he would\nfeel afterwards, and even gave him to understand that he would be more\nlikely to please the women; and the stable-boy began to smile heavily.\nThen he attacked him through his vanity:\n\n\"Aren't you a man? Hang it! what would you have done if you had had to\ngo into the army, to go and fight beneath the standard? Ah! Hippolyte!\"\n\nAnd Homais retired, declaring that he could not understand this\nobstinacy, this blindness in refusing the benefactions of science.\n\nThe poor fellow gave way, for it was like a conspiracy. Binet, who never\ninterfered with other people's business, Madame Lefrancois, Artemise,\nthe neighbours, even the mayor, Monsieur Tuvache--everyone persuaded\nhim, lectured him, shamed him; but what finally decided him was that it\nwould cost him nothing. Bovary even undertook to provide the machine\nfor the operation. This generosity was an idea of Emma's, and Charles\nconsented to it, thinking in his heart of hearts that his wife was an\nangel.\n\nSo by the advice of the chemist, and after three fresh starts, he had a\nkind of box made by the carpenter, with the aid of the locksmith,\nthat weighed about eight pounds, and in which iron, wood, sheer-iron,\nleather, screws, and nuts had not been spared.\n\nBut to know which of Hippolyte's tendons to cut, it was necessary first\nof all to find out what kind of club-foot he had.\n\nHe had a foot forming almost a straight line with the leg, which,\nhowever, did not prevent it from being turned in, so that it was an\nequinus together with something of a varus, or else a slight varus with\na strong tendency to equinus. But with this equinus, wide in foot like\na horse's hoof, with rugose skin, dry tendons, and large toes, on which\nthe black nails looked as if made of iron, the clubfoot ran about like\na deer from morn till night. He was constantly to be seen on the Place,\njumping round the carts, thrusting his limping foot forwards. He seemed\neven stronger on that leg than the other. By dint of hard service it had\nacquired, as it were, moral qualities of patience and energy; and\nwhen he was given some heavy work, he stood on it in preference to its\nfellow.\n\nNow, as it was an equinus, it was necessary to cut the tendon of\nAchilles, and, if need were, the anterior tibial muscle could be seen to\nafterwards for getting rid of the varus; for the doctor did not dare to\nrisk both operations at once; he was even trembling already for fear of\ninjuring some important region that he did not know.\n\nNeither Ambrose Pare, applying for the first time since Celsus, after an\ninterval of fifteen centuries, a ligature to an artery, nor Dupuytren,\nabout to open an abscess in the brain, nor Gensoul when he first took\naway the superior maxilla, had hearts that trembled, hands that shook,\nminds so strained as Monsieur Bovary when he approached Hippolyte, his\ntenotome between his fingers. And as at hospitals, near by on a table\nlay a heap of lint, with waxed thread, many bandages--a pyramid of\nbandages--every bandage to be found at the druggist's. It was Monsieur\nHomais who since morning had been organising all these preparations,\nas much to dazzle the multitude as to keep up his illusions. Charles\npierced the skin; a dry crackling was heard. The tendon was cut, the\noperation over. Hippolyte could not get over his surprise, but bent over\nBovary's hands to cover them with kisses.\n\n\"Come, be calm,\" said the druggist; \"later on you will show your\ngratitude to your benefactor.\"\n\nAnd he went down to tell the result to five or six inquirers who were\nwaiting in the yard, and who fancied that Hippolyte would reappear\nwalking properly. Then Charles, having buckled his patient into the\nmachine, went home, where Emma, all anxiety, awaited him at the door.\nShe threw herself on his neck; they sat down to table; he ate much,\nand at dessert he even wanted to take a cup of coffee, a luxury he only\npermitted himself on Sundays when there was company.\n\nThe evening was charming, full of prattle, of dreams together. They\ntalked about their future fortune, of the improvements to be made in\ntheir house; he saw people's estimation of him growing, his comforts\nincreasing, his wife always loving him; and she was happy to refresh\nherself with a new sentiment, healthier, better, to feel at last some\ntenderness for this poor fellow who adored her. The thought of Rodolphe\nfor one moment passed through her mind, but her eyes turned again to\nCharles; she even noticed with surprise that he had not bad teeth.\n\nThey were in bed when Monsieur Homais, in spite of the servant, suddenly\nentered the room, holding in his hand a sheet of paper just written. It\nwas the paragraph he intended for the \"Fanal de Rouen.\" He brought it\nfor them to read.\n\n\"Read it yourself,\" said Bovary.\n\nHe read--\n\n\"'Despite the prejudices that still invest a part of the face of Europe\nlike a net, the light nevertheless begins to penetrate our country\nplaces. Thus on Tuesday our little town of Yonville found itself the\nscene of a surgical operation which is at the same time an act of\nloftiest philanthropy. Monsieur Bovary, one of our most distinguished\npractitioners--'\"\n\n\"Oh, that is too much! too much!\" said Charles, choking with emotion.\n\n\"No, no! not at all! What next!\"\n\n\"'--Performed an operation on a club-footed man.' I have not used the\nscientific term, because you know in a newspaper everyone would not\nperhaps understand. The masses must--'\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Bovary; \"go on!\"\n\n\"I proceed,\" said the chemist. \"'Monsieur Bovary, one of our most\ndistinguished practitioners, performed an operation on a club-footed man\ncalled Hippolyte Tautain, stableman for the last twenty-five years at\nthe hotel of the \"Lion d'Or,\" kept by Widow Lefrancois, at the Place\nd'Armes. The novelty of the attempt, and the interest incident to the\nsubject, had attracted such a concourse of persons that there was\na veritable obstruction on the threshold of the establishment. The\noperation, moreover, was performed as if by magic, and barely a\nfew drops of blood appeared on the skin, as though to say that the\nrebellious tendon had at last given way beneath the efforts of art. The\npatient, strangely enough--we affirm it as an eye-witness--complained\nof no pain. His condition up to the present time leaves nothing to be\ndesired. Everything tends to show that his convelescence will be brief;\nand who knows even if at our next village festivity we shall not see our\ngood Hippolyte figuring in the bacchic dance in the midst of a chorus\nof joyous boon-companions, and thus proving to all eyes by his verve\nand his capers his complete cure? Honour, then, to the generous savants!\nHonour to those indefatigable spirits who consecrate their vigils to the\namelioration or to the alleviation of their kind! Honour, thrice honour!\nIs it not time to cry that the blind shall see, the deaf hear, the lame\nwalk? But that which fanaticism formerly promised to its elect, science\nnow accomplishes for all men. We shall keep our readers informed as to\nthe successive phases of this remarkable cure.'\"\n\nThis did not prevent Mere Lefrancois, from coming five days after,\nscared, and crying out--\n\n\"Help! he is dying! I am going crazy!\"\n\nCharles rushed to the \"Lion d'Or,\" and the chemist, who caught sight\nof him passing along the Place hatless, abandoned his shop. He appeared\nhimself breathless, red, anxious, and asking everyone who was going up\nthe stairs--\n\n\"Why, what's the matter with our interesting strephopode?\"\n\nThe strephopode was writhing in hideous convulsions, so that the machine\nin which his leg was enclosed was knocked against the wall enough to\nbreak it.\n\nWith many precautions, in order not to disturb the position of the limb,\nthe box was removed, and an awful sight presented itself. The outlines\nof the foot disappeared in such a swelling that the entire skin seemed\nabout to burst, and it was covered with ecchymosis, caused by the famous\nmachine. Hippolyte had already complained of suffering from it. No\nattention had been paid to him; they had to acknowledge that he had not\nbeen altogether wrong, and he was freed for a few hours. But, hardly had\nthe oedema gone down to some extent, than the two savants thought fit\nto put back the limb in the apparatus, strapping it tighter to hasten\nmatters. At last, three days after, Hippolyte being unable to endure it\nany longer, they once more removed the machine, and were much surprised\nat the result they saw. The livid tumefaction spread over the leg, with\nblisters here and there, whence there oozed a black liquid. Matters\nwere taking a serious turn. Hippolyte began to worry himself, and Mere\nLefrancois, had him installed in the little room near the kitchen, so\nthat he might at least have some distraction.\n\nBut the tax-collector, who dined there every day, complained bitterly of\nsuch companionship. Then Hippolyte was removed to the billiard-room.\nHe lay there moaning under his heavy coverings, pale with long beard,\nsunken eyes, and from time to time turning his perspiring head on the\ndirty pillow, where the flies alighted. Madame Bovary went to see him.\nShe brought him linen for his poultices; she comforted, and encouraged\nhim. Besides, he did not want for company, especially on market-days,\nwhen the peasants were knocking about the billiard-balls round him,\nfenced with the cues, smoked, drank, sang, and brawled.\n\n\"How are you?\" they said, clapping him on the shoulder. \"Ah! you're not\nup to much, it seems, but it's your own fault. You should do this! do\nthat!\" And then they told him stories of people who had all been cured\nby other remedies than his. Then by way of consolation they added--\n\n\"You give way too much! Get up! You coddle yourself like a king! All the\nsame, old chap, you don't smell nice!\"\n\nGangrene, in fact, was spreading more and more. Bovary himself turned\nsick at it. He came every hour, every moment. Hippolyte looked at him\nwith eyes full of terror, sobbing--\n\n\"When shall I get well? Oh, save me! How unfortunate I am! How\nunfortunate I am!\"\n\nAnd the doctor left, always recommending him to diet himself.\n\n\"Don't listen to him, my lad,\" said Mere Lefrancois, \"Haven't they\ntortured you enough already? You'll grow still weaker. Here! swallow\nthis.\"\n\nAnd she gave him some good beef-tea, a slice of mutton, a piece of\nbacon, and sometimes small glasses of brandy, that he had not the\nstrength to put to his lips.\n\nAbbe Bournisien, hearing that he was growing worse, asked to see him.\nHe began by pitying his sufferings, declaring at the same time that he\nought to rejoice at them since it was the will of the Lord, and take\nadvantage of the occasion to reconcile himself to Heaven.\n\n\"For,\" said the ecclesiastic in a paternal tone, \"you rather neglected\nyour duties; you were rarely seen at divine worship. How many years is\nit since you approached the holy table? I understand that your work,\nthat the whirl of the world may have kept you from care for your\nsalvation. But now is the time to reflect. Yet don't despair. I have\nknown great sinners, who, about to appear before God (you are not yet\nat this point I know), had implored His mercy, and who certainly died in\nthe best frame of mind. Let us hope that, like them, you will set us a\ngood example. Thus, as a precaution, what is to prevent you from saying\nmorning and evening a 'Hail Mary, full of grace,' and 'Our Father which\nart in heaven'? Yes, do that, for my sake, to oblige me. That won't cost\nyou anything. Will you promise me?\"\n\nThe poor devil promised. The cure came back day after day. He chatted\nwith the landlady; and even told anecdotes interspersed with jokes and\npuns that Hippolyte did not understand. Then, as soon as he could, he\nfell back upon matters of religion, putting on an appropriate expression\nof face.\n\nHis zeal seemed successful, for the club-foot soon manifested a desire\nto go on a pilgrimage to Bon-Secours if he were cured; to which Monsieur\nBournisien replied that he saw no objection; two precautions were better\nthan one; it was no risk anyhow.\n\nThe druggist was indignant at what he called the manoeuvres of the\npriest; they were prejudicial, he said, to Hippolyte's convalescence,\nand he kept repeating to Madame Lefrancois, \"Leave him alone! leave him\nalone! You perturb his morals with your mysticism.\" But the good woman\nwould no longer listen to him; he was the cause of it all. From a spirit\nof contradiction she hung up near the bedside of the patient a basin\nfilled with holy-water and a branch of box.\n\nReligion, however, seemed no more able to succour him than surgery, and\nthe invincible gangrene still spread from the extremities towards\nthe stomach. It was all very well to vary the potions and change the\npoultices; the muscles each day rotted more and more; and at last\nCharles replied by an affirmative nod of the head when Mere Lefrancois,\nasked him if she could not, as a forlorn hope, send for Monsieur Canivet\nof Neufchatel, who was a celebrity.\n\nA doctor of medicine, fifty years of age, enjoying a good position\nand self-possessed, Charles's colleague did not refrain from laughing\ndisdainfully when he had uncovered the leg, mortified to the knee. Then\nhaving flatly declared that it must be amputated, he went off to the\nchemist's to rail at the asses who could have reduced a poor man to such\na state. Shaking Monsieur Homais by the button of his coat, he shouted\nout in the shop--\n\n\"These are the inventions of Paris! These are the ideas of those gentry\nof the capital! It is like strabismus, chloroform, lithotrity, a heap of\nmonstrosities that the Government ought to prohibit. But they want to do\nthe clever, and they cram you with remedies without, troubling about\nthe consequences. We are not so clever, not we! We are not savants,\ncoxcombs, fops! We are practitioners; we cure people, and we should\nnot dream of operating on anyone who is in perfect health. Straighten\nclub-feet! As if one could straighten club-feet! It is as if one wished,\nfor example, to make a hunchback straight!\"\n\nHomais suffered as he listened to this discourse, and he concealed his\ndiscomfort beneath a courtier's smile; for he needed to humour Monsier\nCanivet, whose prescriptions sometimes came as far as Yonville. So he\ndid not take up the defence of Bovary; he did not even make a single\nremark, and, renouncing his principles, he sacrificed his dignity to the\nmore serious interests of his business.\n\nThis amputation of the thigh by Doctor Canivet was a great event in the\nvillage. On that day all the inhabitants got up earlier, and the Grande\nRue, although full of people, had something lugubrious about it, as\nif an execution had been expected. At the grocer's they discussed\nHippolyte's illness; the shops did no business, and Madame Tuvache, the\nmayor's wife, did not stir from her window, such was her impatience to\nsee the operator arrive.\n\nHe came in his gig, which he drove himself. But the springs of the right\nside having at length given way beneath the weight of his corpulence, it\nhappened that the carriage as it rolled along leaned over a little, and\non the other cushion near him could be seen a large box covered in red\nsheep-leather, whose three brass clasps shone grandly.\n\nAfter he had entered like a whirlwind the porch of the \"Lion d'Or,\" the\ndoctor, shouting very loud, ordered them to unharness his horse. Then he\nwent into the stable to see that she was eating her oats all right; for\non arriving at a patient's he first of all looked after his mare and his\ngig. People even said about this--\n\n\"Ah! Monsieur Canivet's a character!\"\n\nAnd he was the more esteemed for this imperturbable coolness. The\nuniverse to the last man might have died, and he would not have missed\nthe smallest of his habits.\n\nHomais presented himself.\n\n\"I count on you,\" said the doctor. \"Are we ready? Come along!\"\n\nBut the druggist, turning red, confessed that he was too sensitive to\nassist at such an operation.\n\n\"When one is a simple spectator,\" he said, \"the imagination, you know,\nis impressed. And then I have such a nervous system!\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" interrupted Canivet; \"on the contrary, you seem to me inclined\nto apoplexy. Besides, that doesn't astonish me, for you chemist fellows\nare always poking about your kitchens, which must end by spoiling your\nconstitutions. Now just look at me. I get up every day at four o'clock;\nI shave with cold water (and am never cold). I don't wear flannels, and\nI never catch cold; my carcass is good enough! I live now in one way,\nnow in another, like a philosopher, taking pot-luck; that is why I\nam not squeamish like you, and it is as indifferent to me to carve a\nChristian as the first fowl that turns up. Then, perhaps, you will say,\nhabit! habit!\"\n\nThen, without any consideration for Hippolyte, who was sweating with\nagony between his sheets, these gentlemen entered into a conversation,\nin which the druggist compared the coolness of a surgeon to that of a\ngeneral; and this comparison was pleasing to Canivet, who launched out\non the exigencies of his art. He looked upon, it as a sacred office,\nalthough the ordinary practitioners dishonoured it. At last, coming back\nto the patient, he examined the bandages brought by Homais, the same\nthat had appeared for the club-foot, and asked for someone to hold the\nlimb for him. Lestiboudois was sent for, and Monsieur Canivet having\nturned up his sleeves, passed into the billiard-room, while the druggist\nstayed with Artemise and the landlady, both whiter than their aprons,\nand with ears strained towards the door.\n\nBovary during this time did not dare to stir from his house.\n\nHe kept downstairs in the sitting-room by the side of the fireless\nchimney, his chin on his breast, his hands clasped, his eyes staring.\n\"What a mishap!\" he thought, \"what a mishap!\" Perhaps, after all, he had\nmade some slip. He thought it over, but could hit upon nothing. But the\nmost famous surgeons also made mistakes; and that is what no one would\never believe! People, on the contrary, would laugh, jeer! It would\nspread as far as Forges, as Neufchatel, as Rouen, everywhere! Who could\nsay if his colleagues would not write against him. Polemics would ensue;\nhe would have to answer in the papers. Hippolyte might even prosecute\nhim. He saw himself dishonoured, ruined, lost; and his imagination,\nassailed by a world of hypotheses, tossed amongst them like an empty\ncask borne by the sea and floating upon the waves.\n\nEmma, opposite, watched him; she did not share his humiliation; she felt\nanother--that of having supposed such a man was worth anything. As if\ntwenty times already she had not sufficiently perceived his mediocrity.\n\nCharles was walking up and down the room; his boots creaked on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Sit down,\" she said; \"you fidget me.\"\n\nHe sat down again.\n\nHow was it that she--she, who was so intelligent--could have allowed\nherself to be deceived again? and through what deplorable madness had\nshe thus ruined her life by continual sacrifices? She recalled all her\ninstincts of luxury, all the privations of her soul, the sordidness of\nmarriage, of the household, her dream sinking into the mire like wounded\nswallows; all that she had longed for, all that she had denied herself,\nall that she might have had! And for what? for what?\n\nIn the midst of the silence that hung over the village a heart-rending\ncry rose on the air. Bovary turned white to fainting. She knit her\nbrows with a nervous gesture, then went on. And it was for him, for this\ncreature, for this man, who understood nothing, who felt nothing! For he\nwas there quite quiet, not even suspecting that the ridicule of his name\nwould henceforth sully hers as well as his. She had made efforts to love\nhim, and she had repented with tears for having yielded to another!\n\n\"But it was perhaps a valgus!\" suddenly exclaimed Bovary, who was\nmeditating.\n\nAt the unexpected shock of this phrase falling on her thought like a\nleaden bullet on a silver plate, Emma, shuddering, raised her head in\norder to find out what he meant to say; and they looked at the other in\nsilence, almost amazed to see each other, so far sundered were they\nby their inner thoughts. Charles gazed at her with the dull look of\na drunken man, while he listened motionless to the last cries of the\nsufferer, that followed each other in long-drawn modulations, broken by\nsharp spasms like the far-off howling of some beast being slaughtered.\nEmma bit her wan lips, and rolling between her fingers a piece of coral\nthat she had broken, fixed on Charles the burning glance of her eyes\nlike two arrows of fire about to dart forth. Everything in him irritated\nher now; his face, his dress, what he did not say, his whole person, his\nexistence, in fine. She repented of her past virtue as of a crime, and\nwhat still remained of it rumbled away beneath the furious blows of her\npride. She revelled in all the evil ironies of triumphant adultery.\nThe memory of her lover came back to her with dazzling attractions; she\nthrew her whole soul into it, borne away towards this image with a fresh\nenthusiasm; and Charles seemed to her as much removed from her life, as\nabsent forever, as impossible and annihilated, as if he had been about\nto die and were passing under her eyes.\n\nThere was a sound of steps on the pavement. Charles looked up, and\nthrough the lowered blinds he saw at the corner of the market in\nthe broad sunshine Dr. Canivet, who was wiping his brow with his\nhandkerchief. Homais, behind him, was carrying a large red box in his\nhand, and both were going towards the chemist's.\n\nThen with a feeling of sudden tenderness and discouragement Charles\nturned to his wife saying to her--\n\n\"Oh, kiss me, my own!\"\n\n\"Leave me!\" she said, red with anger.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked, stupefied. \"Be calm; compose yourself.\nYou know well enough that I love you. Come!\"\n\n\"Enough!\" she cried with a terrible look.\n\nAnd escaping from the room, Emma closed the door so violently that the\nbarometer fell from the wall and smashed on the floor.\n\nCharles sank back into his arm-chair overwhelmed, trying to discover\nwhat could be wrong with her, fancying some nervous illness, weeping,\nand vaguely feeling something fatal and incomprehensible whirling round\nhim.\n\nWhen Rodolphe came to the garden that evening, he found his mistress\nwaiting for him at the foot of the steps on the lowest stair. They threw\ntheir arms round one another, and all their rancour melted like snow\nbeneath the warmth of that kiss.\n\n\n\nChapter Twelve\n\nThey began to love one another again. Often, even in the middle of the\nday, Emma suddenly wrote to him, then from the window made a sign to\nJustin, who, taking his apron off, quickly ran to La Huchette. Rodolphe\nwould come; she had sent for him to tell him that she was bored, that\nher husband was odious, her life frightful.\n\n\"But what can I do?\" he cried one day impatiently.\n\n\"Ah! if you would--\"\n\nShe was sitting on the floor between his knees, her hair loose, her look\nlost.\n\n\"Why, what?\" said Rodolphe.\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"We would go and live elsewhere--somewhere!\"\n\n\"You are really mad!\" he said laughing. \"How could that be possible?\"\n\nShe returned to the subject; he pretended not to understand, and turned\nthe conversation.\n\nWhat he did not understand was all this worry about so simple an affair\nas love. She had a motive, a reason, and, as it were, a pendant to her\naffection.\n\nHer tenderness, in fact, grew each day with her repulsion to her\nhusband. The more she gave up herself to the one, the more she loathed\nthe other. Never had Charles seemed to her so disagreeable, to have\nsuch stodgy fingers, such vulgar ways, to be so dull as when they found\nthemselves together after her meeting with Rodolphe. Then, while playing\nthe spouse and virtue, she was burning at the thought of that head whose\nblack hair fell in a curl over the sunburnt brow, of that form at once\nso strong and elegant, of that man, in a word, who had such experience\nin his reasoning, such passion in his desires. It was for him that she\nfiled her nails with the care of a chaser, and that there was never\nenough cold-cream for her skin, nor of patchouli for her handkerchiefs.\nShe loaded herself with bracelets, rings, and necklaces. When he\nwas coming she filled the two large blue glass vases with roses, and\nprepared her room and her person like a courtesan expecting a prince.\nThe servant had to be constantly washing linen, and all day Felicite\ndid not stir from the kitchen, where little Justin, who often kept her\ncompany, watched her at work.\n\nWith his elbows on the long board on which she was ironing, he\ngreedily watched all these women's clothes spread about him, the dimity\npetticoats, the fichus, the collars, and the drawers with running\nstrings, wide at the hips and growing narrower below.\n\n\"What is that for?\" asked the young fellow, passing his hand over the\ncrinoline or the hooks and eyes.\n\n\"Why, haven't you ever seen anything?\" Felicite answered laughing. \"As\nif your mistress, Madame Homais, didn't wear the same.\"\n\n\"Oh, I daresay! Madame Homais!\" And he added with a meditative air, \"As\nif she were a lady like madame!\"\n\nBut Felicite grew impatient of seeing him hanging round her. She was six\nyears older than he, and Theodore, Monsieur Guillaumin's servant, was\nbeginning to pay court to her.\n\n\"Let me alone,\" she said, moving her pot of starch. \"You'd better be\noff and pound almonds; you are always dangling about women. Before you\nmeddle with such things, bad boy, wait till you've got a beard to your\nchin.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be cross! I'll go and clean her boots.\"\n\nAnd he at once took down from the shelf Emma's boots, all coated with\nmud, the mud of the rendezvous, that crumbled into powder beneath his\nfingers, and that he watched as it gently rose in a ray of sunlight.\n\n\"How afraid you are of spoiling them!\" said the servant, who wasn't so\nparticular when she cleaned them herself, because as soon as the stuff\nof the boots was no longer fresh madame handed them over to her.\n\nEmma had a number in her cupboard that she squandered one after the\nother, without Charles allowing himself the slightest observation. So\nalso he disbursed three hundred francs for a wooden leg that she thought\nproper to make a present of to Hippolyte. Its top was covered with cork,\nand it had spring joints, a complicated mechanism, covered over by black\ntrousers ending in a patent-leather boot. But Hippolyte, not daring\nto use such a handsome leg every day, begged Madame Bovary to get him\nanother more convenient one. The doctor, of course, had again to defray\nthe expense of this purchase.\n\nSo little by little the stable-man took up his work again. One saw him\nrunning about the village as before, and when Charles heard from afar\nthe sharp noise of the wooden leg, he at once went in another direction.\n\nIt was Monsieur Lheureux, the shopkeeper, who had undertaken the order;\nthis provided him with an excuse for visiting Emma. He chatted with her\nabout the new goods from Paris, about a thousand feminine trifles, made\nhimself very obliging, and never asked for his money. Emma yielded to\nthis lazy mode of satisfying all her caprices. Thus she wanted to have\na very handsome ridding-whip that was at an umbrella-maker's at Rouen\nto give to Rodolphe. The week after Monsieur Lheureux placed it on her\ntable.\n\nBut the next day he called on her with a bill for two hundred and\nseventy francs, not counting the centimes. Emma was much embarrassed;\nall the drawers of the writing-table were empty; they owed over a\nfortnight's wages to Lestiboudois, two quarters to the servant, for any\nquantity of other things, and Bovary was impatiently expecting Monsieur\nDerozeray's account, which he was in the habit of paying every year\nabout Midsummer.\n\nShe succeeded at first in putting off Lheureux. At last he lost\npatience; he was being sued; his capital was out, and unless he got some\nin he should be forced to take back all the goods she had received.\n\n\"Oh, very well, take them!\" said Emma.\n\n\"I was only joking,\" he replied; \"the only thing I regret is the whip.\nMy word! I'll ask monsieur to return it to me.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she said.\n\n\"Ah! I've got you!\" thought Lheureux.\n\nAnd, certain of his discovery, he went out repeating to himself in an\nundertone, and with his usual low whistle--\n\n\"Good! we shall see! we shall see!\"\n\nShe was thinking how to get out of this when the servant coming in\nput on the mantelpiece a small roll of blue paper \"from Monsieur\nDerozeray's.\" Emma pounced upon and opened it. It contained fifteen\nnapoleons; it was the account. She heard Charles on the stairs; threw\nthe gold to the back of her drawer, and took out the key.\n\nThree days after Lheureux reappeared.\n\n\"I have an arrangement to suggest to you,\" he said. \"If, instead of the\nsum agreed on, you would take--\"\n\n\"Here it is,\" she said placing fourteen napoleons in his hand.\n\nThe tradesman was dumfounded. Then, to conceal his disappointment, he\nwas profuse in apologies and proffers of service, all of which Emma\ndeclined; then she remained a few moments fingering in the pocket of\nher apron the two five-franc pieces that he had given her in change.\nShe promised herself she would economise in order to pay back later on.\n\"Pshaw!\" she thought, \"he won't think about it again.\"\n\nBesides the riding-whip with its silver-gilt handle, Rodolphe had\nreceived a seal with the motto Amor nel cor* furthermore, a scarf for\na muffler, and, finally, a cigar-case exactly like the Viscount's, that\nCharles had formerly picked up in the road, and that Emma had kept.\nThese presents, however, humiliated him; he refused several; she\ninsisted, and he ended by obeying, thinking her tyrannical and\noverexacting.\n\n     *A loving heart.\n\nThen she had strange ideas.\n\n\"When midnight strikes,\" she said, \"you must think of me.\"\n\nAnd if he confessed that he had not thought of her, there were floods of\nreproaches that always ended with the eternal question--\n\n\"Do you love me?\"\n\n\"Why, of course I love you,\" he answered.\n\n\"A great deal?\"\n\n\"Certainly!\"\n\n\"You haven't loved any others?\"\n\n\"Did you think you'd got a virgin?\" he exclaimed laughing.\n\nEmma cried, and he tried to console her, adorning his protestations with\npuns.\n\n\"Oh,\" she went on, \"I love you! I love you so that I could not live\nwithout you, do you see? There are times when I long to see you again,\nwhen I am torn by all the anger of love. I ask myself, Where is\nhe? Perhaps he is talking to other women. They smile upon him; he\napproaches. Oh no; no one else pleases you. There are some more\nbeautiful, but I love you best. I know how to love best. I am your\nservant, your concubine! You are my king, my idol! You are good, you are\nbeautiful, you are clever, you are strong!\"\n\nHe had so often heard these things said that they did not strike him as\noriginal. Emma was like all his mistresses; and the charm of novelty,\ngradually falling away like a garment, laid bare the eternal monotony\nof passion, that has always the same forms and the same language. He\ndid not distinguish, this man of so much experience, the difference of\nsentiment beneath the sameness of expression. Because lips libertine\nand venal had murmured such words to him, he believed but little in the\ncandour of hers; exaggerated speeches hiding mediocre affections must be\ndiscounted; as if the fullness of the soul did not sometimes overflow in\nthe emptiest metaphors, since no one can ever give the exact measure of\nhis needs, nor of his conceptions, nor of his sorrows; and since human\nspeech is like a cracked tin kettle, on which we hammer out tunes to\nmake bears dance when we long to move the stars.\n\nBut with that superior critical judgment that belongs to him who, in no\nmatter what circumstance, holds back, Rodolphe saw other delights to be\ngot out of this love. He thought all modesty in the way. He treated her\nquite sans facon.* He made of her something supple and corrupt. Hers\nwas an idiotic sort of attachment, full of admiration for him, of\nvoluptuousness for her, a beatitude that benumbed her; her soul sank\ninto this drunkenness, shrivelled up, drowned in it, like Clarence in\nhis butt of Malmsey.\n\n     *Off-handedly.\n\n\nBy the mere effect of her love Madame Bovary's manners changed.\nHer looks grew bolder, her speech more free; she even committed the\nimpropriety of walking out with Monsieur Rodolphe, a cigarette in her\nmouth, \"as if to defy the people.\" At last, those who still doubted\ndoubted no longer when one day they saw her getting out of the\n\"Hirondelle,\" her waist squeezed into a waistcoat like a man; and Madame\nBovary senior, who, after a fearful scene with her husband, had taken\nrefuge at her son's, was not the least scandalised of the women-folk.\nMany other things displeased her. First, Charles had not attended to\nher advice about the forbidding of novels; then the \"ways of the house\"\nannoyed her; she allowed herself to make some remarks, and there were\nquarrels, especially one on account of Felicite.\n\nMadame Bovary senior, the evening before, passing along the passage,\nhad surprised her in company of a man--a man with a brown collar, about\nforty years old, who, at the sound of her step, had quickly escaped\nthrough the kitchen. Then Emma began to laugh, but the good lady grew\nangry, declaring that unless morals were to be laughed at one ought to\nlook after those of one's servants.\n\n\"Where were you brought up?\" asked the daughter-in-law, with so\nimpertinent a look that Madame Bovary asked her if she were not perhaps\ndefending her own case.\n\n\"Leave the room!\" said the young woman, springing up with a bound.\n\n\"Emma! Mamma!\" cried Charles, trying to reconcile them.\n\nBut both had fled in their exasperation. Emma was stamping her feet as\nshe repeated--\n\n\"Oh! what manners! What a peasant!\"\n\nHe ran to his mother; she was beside herself. She stammered\n\n\"She is an insolent, giddy-headed thing, or perhaps worse!\"\n\nAnd she was for leaving at once if the other did not apologise. So\nCharles went back again to his wife and implored her to give way; he\nknelt to her; she ended by saying--\n\n\"Very well! I'll go to her.\"\n\nAnd in fact she held out her hand to her mother-in-law with the dignity\nof a marchioness as she said--\n\n\"Excuse me, madame.\"\n\nThen, having gone up again to her room, she threw herself flat on her\nbed and cried there like a child, her face buried in the pillow.\n\nShe and Rodolphe had agreed that in the event of anything extraordinary\noccurring, she should fasten a small piece of white paper to the blind,\nso that if by chance he happened to be in Yonville, he could hurry to\nthe lane behind the house. Emma made the signal; she had been waiting\nthree-quarters of an hour when she suddenly caught sight of Rodolphe at\nthe corner of the market. She felt tempted to open the window and call\nhim, but he had already disappeared. She fell back in despair.\n\nSoon, however, it seemed to her that someone was walking on the\npavement. It was he, no doubt. She went downstairs, crossed the yard. He\nwas there outside. She threw herself into his arms.\n\n\"Do take care!\" he said.\n\n\"Ah! if you knew!\" she replied.\n\nAnd she began telling him everything, hurriedly, disjointedly,\nexaggerating the facts, inventing many, and so prodigal of parentheses\nthat he understood nothing of it.\n\n\"Come, my poor angel, courage! Be comforted! be patient!\"\n\n\"But I have been patient; I have suffered for four years. A love like\nours ought to show itself in the face of heaven. They torture me! I can\nbear it no longer! Save me!\"\n\nShe clung to Rodolphe. Her eyes, full of tears, flashed like flames\nbeneath a wave; her breast heaved; he had never loved her so much, so\nthat he lost his head and said \"What is, it? What do you wish?\"\n\n\"Take me away,\" she cried, \"carry me off! Oh, I pray you!\"\n\nAnd she threw herself upon his mouth, as if to seize there the\nunexpected consent if breathed forth in a kiss.\n\n\"But--\" Rodolphe resumed.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Your little girl!\"\n\nShe reflected a few moments, then replied--\n\n\"We will take her! It can't be helped!\"\n\n\"What a woman!\" he said to himself, watching her as she went. For she\nhad run into the garden. Someone was calling her.\n\nOn the following days Madame Bovary senior was much surprised at the\nchange in her daughter-in-law. Emma, in fact, was showing herself more\ndocile, and even carried her deference so far as to ask for a recipe for\npickling gherkins.\n\nWas it the better to deceive them both? Or did she wish by a sort of\nvoluptuous stoicism to feel the more profoundly the bitterness of the\nthings she was about to leave?\n\nBut she paid no heed to them; on the contrary, she lived as lost in the\nanticipated delight of her coming happiness.\n\nIt was an eternal subject for conversation with Rodolphe. She leant on\nhis shoulder murmuring--\n\n\"Ah! when we are in the mail-coach! Do you think about it? Can it be? It\nseems to me that the moment I feel the carriage start, it will be as if\nwe were rising in a balloon, as if we were setting out for the clouds.\nDo you know that I count the hours? And you?\"\n\nNever had Madame Bovary been so beautiful as at this period; she had\nthat indefinable beauty that results from joy, from enthusiasm, from\nsuccess, and that is only the harmony of temperament with circumstances.\nHer desires, her sorrows, the experience of pleasure, and her ever-young\nillusions, that had, as soil and rain and winds and the sun make flowers\ngrow, gradually developed her, and she at length blossomed forth in all\nthe plenitude of her nature. Her eyelids seemed chiselled expressly for\nher long amorous looks in which the pupil disappeared, while a strong\ninspiration expanded her delicate nostrils and raised the fleshy corner\nof her lips, shaded in the light by a little black down. One would have\nthought that an artist apt in conception had arranged the curls of hair\nupon her neck; they fell in a thick mass, negligently, and with the\nchanging chances of their adultery, that unbound them every day. Her\nvoice now took more mellow infections, her figure also; something subtle\nand penetrating escaped even from the folds of her gown and from the\nline of her foot. Charles, as when they were first married, thought her\ndelicious and quite irresistible.\n\nWhen he came home in the middle of the night, he did not dare to wake\nher. The porcelain night-light threw a round trembling gleam upon the\nceiling, and the drawn curtains of the little cot formed as it were a\nwhite hut standing out in the shade, and by the bedside Charles looked\nat them. He seemed to hear the light breathing of his child. She would\ngrow big now; every season would bring rapid progress. He already saw\nher coming from school as the day drew in, laughing, with ink-stains on\nher jacket, and carrying her basket on her arm. Then she would have to\nbe sent to the boarding-school; that would cost much; how was it to\nbe done? Then he reflected. He thought of hiring a small farm in the\nneighbourhood, that he would superintend every morning on his way to his\npatients. He would save up what he brought in; he would put it in the\nsavings-bank. Then he would buy shares somewhere, no matter where;\nbesides, his practice would increase; he counted upon that, for he\nwanted Berthe to be well-educated, to be accomplished, to learn to play\nthe piano. Ah! how pretty she would be later on when she was fifteen,\nwhen, resembling her mother, she would, like her, wear large straw hats\nin the summer-time; from a distance they would be taken for two sisters.\nHe pictured her to himself working in the evening by their side beneath\nthe light of the lamp; she would embroider him slippers; she would look\nafter the house; she would fill all the home with her charm and her\ngaiety. At last, they would think of her marriage; they would find her\nsome good young fellow with a steady business; he would make her happy;\nthis would last for ever.\n\nEmma was not asleep; she pretended to be; and while he dozed off by her\nside she awakened to other dreams.\n\nTo the gallop of four horses she was carried away for a week towards a\nnew land, whence they would return no more. They went on and on, their\narms entwined, without a word. Often from the top of a mountain there\nsuddenly glimpsed some splendid city with domes, and bridges, and\nships, forests of citron trees, and cathedrals of white marble, on whose\npointed steeples were storks' nests. They went at a walking-pace because\nof the great flag-stones, and on the ground there were bouquets of\nflowers, offered you by women dressed in red bodices. They heard the\nchiming of bells, the neighing of mules, together with the murmur of\nguitars and the noise of fountains, whose rising spray refreshed heaps\nof fruit arranged like a pyramid at the foot of pale statues that smiled\nbeneath playing waters. And then, one night they came to a fishing\nvillage, where brown nets were drying in the wind along the cliffs and\nin front of the huts. It was there that they would stay; they would live\nin a low, flat-roofed house, shaded by a palm-tree, in the heart of a\ngulf, by the sea. They would row in gondolas, swing in hammocks, and\ntheir existence would be easy and large as their silk gowns, warm and\nstar-spangled as the nights they would contemplate. However, in the\nimmensity of this future that she conjured up, nothing special stood\nforth; the days, all magnificent, resembled each other like waves; and\nit swayed in the horizon, infinite, harmonised, azure, and bathed in\nsunshine. But the child began to cough in her cot or Bovary snored\nmore loudly, and Emma did not fall asleep till morning, when the dawn\nwhitened the windows, and when little Justin was already in the square\ntaking down the shutters of the chemist's shop.\n\nShe had sent for Monsieur Lheureux, and had said to him--\n\n\"I want a cloak--a large lined cloak with a deep collar.\"\n\n\"You are going on a journey?\" he asked.\n\n\"No; but--never mind. I may count on you, may I not, and quickly?\"\n\nHe bowed.\n\n\"Besides, I shall want,\" she went on, \"a trunk--not too heavy--handy.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I understand. About three feet by a foot and a half, as they\nare being made just now.\"\n\n\"And a travelling bag.\"\n\n\"Decidedly,\" thought Lheureux, \"there's a row on here.\"\n\n\"And,\" said Madame Bovary, taking her watch from her belt, \"take this;\nyou can pay yourself out of it.\"\n\nBut the tradesman cried out that she was wrong; they knew one another;\ndid he doubt her? What childishness!\n\nShe insisted, however, on his taking at least the chain, and Lheureux\nhad already put it in his pocket and was going, when she called him\nback.\n\n\"You will leave everything at your place. As to the cloak\"--she seemed\nto be reflecting--\"do not bring it either; you can give me the maker's\naddress, and tell him to have it ready for me.\"\n\nIt was the next month that they were to run away. She was to leave\nYonville as if she was going on some business to Rouen. Rodolphe would\nhave booked the seats, procured the passports, and even have written to\nParis in order to have the whole mail-coach reserved for them as far as\nMarseilles, where they would buy a carriage, and go on thence without\nstopping to Genoa. She would take care to send her luggage to Lheureux\nwhence it would be taken direct to the \"Hirondelle,\" so that no one\nwould have any suspicion. And in all this there never was any allusion\nto the child. Rodolphe avoided speaking of her; perhaps he no longer\nthought about it.\n\nHe wished to have two more weeks before him to arrange some affairs;\nthen at the end of a week he wanted two more; then he said he was ill;\nnext he went on a journey. The month of August passed, and, after all\nthese delays, they decided that it was to be irrevocably fixed for the\n4th September--a Monday.\n\nAt length the Saturday before arrived.\n\nRodolphe came in the evening earlier than usual.\n\n\"Everything is ready?\" she asked him.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThen they walked round a garden-bed, and went to sit down near the\nterrace on the kerb-stone of the wall.\n\n\"You are sad,\" said Emma.\n\n\"No; why?\"\n\nAnd yet he looked at her strangely in a tender fashion.\n\n\"It is because you are going away?\" she went on; \"because you are\nleaving what is dear to you--your life? Ah! I understand. I have nothing\nin the world! you are all to me; so shall I be to you. I will be your\npeople, your country; I will tend, I will love you!\"\n\n\"How sweet you are!\" he said, seizing her in his arms.\n\n\"Really!\" she said with a voluptuous laugh. \"Do you love me? Swear it\nthen!\"\n\n\"Do I love you--love you? I adore you, my love.\"\n\nThe moon, full and purple-coloured, was rising right out of the earth\nat the end of the meadow. She rose quickly between the branches of the\npoplars, that hid her here and there like a black curtain pierced with\nholes. Then she appeared dazzling with whiteness in the empty heavens\nthat she lit up, and now sailing more slowly along, let fall upon the\nriver a great stain that broke up into an infinity of stars; and the\nsilver sheen seemed to writhe through the very depths like a heedless\nserpent covered with luminous scales; it also resembled some monster\ncandelabra all along which sparkled drops of diamonds running together.\nThe soft night was about them; masses of shadow filled the branches.\nEmma, her eyes half closed, breathed in with deep sighs the fresh wind\nthat was blowing. They did not speak, lost as they were in the rush of\ntheir reverie. The tenderness of the old days came back to their hearts,\nfull and silent as the flowing river, with the softness of the perfume\nof the syringas, and threw across their memories shadows more immense\nand more sombre than those of the still willows that lengthened out over\nthe grass. Often some night-animal, hedgehog or weasel, setting out on\nthe hunt, disturbed the lovers, or sometimes they heard a ripe peach\nfalling all alone from the espalier.\n\n\"Ah! what a lovely night!\" said Rodolphe.\n\n\"We shall have others,\" replied Emma; and, as if speaking to herself:\n\"Yet, it will be good to travel. And yet, why should my heart be\nso heavy? Is it dread of the unknown? The effect of habits left? Or\nrather--? No; it is the excess of happiness. How weak I am, am I not?\nForgive me!\"\n\n\"There is still time!\" he cried. \"Reflect! perhaps you may repent!\"\n\n\"Never!\" she cried impetuously. And coming closer to him: \"What ill\ncould come to me? There is no desert, no precipice, no ocean I would not\ntraverse with you. The longer we live together the more it will be like\nan embrace, every day closer, more heart to heart. There will be\nnothing to trouble us, no cares, no obstacle. We shall be alone, all to\nourselves eternally. Oh, speak! Answer me!\"\n\nAt regular intervals he answered, \"Yes--Yes--\" She had passed her hands\nthrough his hair, and she repeated in a childlike voice, despite the big\ntears which were falling, \"Rodolphe! Rodolphe! Ah! Rodolphe! dear little\nRodolphe!\"\n\nMidnight struck.\n\n\"Midnight!\" said she. \"Come, it is to-morrow. One day more!\"\n\nHe rose to go; and as if the movement he made had been the signal for\ntheir flight, Emma said, suddenly assuming a gay air--\n\n\"You have the passports?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You are forgetting nothing?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Are you sure?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"It is at the Hotel de Provence, is it not, that you will wait for me at\nmidday?\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\n\"Till to-morrow then!\" said Emma in a last caress; and she watched him\ngo.\n\nHe did not turn round. She ran after him, and, leaning over the water's\nedge between the bulrushes--\n\n\"To-morrow!\" she cried.\n\nHe was already on the other side of the river and walking fast across\nthe meadow.\n\nAfter a few moments Rodolphe stopped; and when he saw her with her white\ngown gradually fade away in the shade like a ghost, he was seized with\nsuch a beating of the heart that he leant against a tree lest he should\nfall.\n\n\"What an imbecile I am!\" he said with a fearful oath. \"No matter! She\nwas a pretty mistress!\"\n\nAnd immediately Emma's beauty, with all the pleasures of their love,\ncame back to him. For a moment he softened; then he rebelled against\nher.\n\n\"For, after all,\" he exclaimed, gesticulating, \"I can't exile\nmyself--have a child on my hands.\"\n\nHe was saying these things to give himself firmness.\n\n\"And besides, the worry, the expense! Ah! no, no, no, no! a thousand\ntimes no! That would be too stupid.\"\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen\n\nNo sooner was Rodolphe at home than he sat down quickly at his bureau\nunder the stag's head that hung as a trophy on the wall. But when he had\nthe pen between his fingers, he could think of nothing, so that, resting\non his elbows, he began to reflect. Emma seemed to him to have receded\ninto a far-off past, as if the resolution he had taken had suddenly\nplaced a distance between them.\n\nTo get back something of her, he fetched from the cupboard at the\nbedside an old Rheims biscuit-box, in which he usually kept his letters\nfrom women, and from it came an odour of dry dust and withered\nroses. First he saw a handkerchief with pale little spots. It was a\nhandkerchief of hers. Once when they were walking her nose had bled; he\nhad forgotten it. Near it, chipped at all the corners, was a miniature\ngiven him by Emma: her toilette seemed to him pretentious, and her\nlanguishing look in the worst possible taste. Then, from looking at this\nimage and recalling the memory of its original, Emma's features little\nby little grew confused in his remembrance, as if the living and the\npainted face, rubbing one against the other, had effaced each other.\nFinally, he read some of her letters; they were full of explanations\nrelating to their journey, short, technical, and urgent, like business\nnotes. He wanted to see the long ones again, those of old times. In\norder to find them at the bottom of the box, Rodolphe disturbed all the\nothers, and mechanically began rummaging amidst this mass of papers and\nthings, finding pell-mell bouquets, garters, a black mask, pins, and\nhair--hair! dark and fair, some even, catching in the hinges of the box,\nbroke when it was opened.\n\nThus dallying with his souvenirs, he examined the writing and the style\nof the letters, as varied as their orthography. They were tender or\njovial, facetious, melancholy; there were some that asked for love,\nothers that asked for money. A word recalled faces to him, certain\ngestures, the sound of a voice; sometimes, however, he remembered\nnothing at all.\n\nIn fact, these women, rushing at once into his thoughts, cramped each\nother and lessened, as reduced to a uniform level of love that equalised\nthem all. So taking handfuls of the mixed-up letters, he amused himself\nfor some moments with letting them fall in cascades from his right into\nhis left hand. At last, bored and weary, Rodolphe took back the box to\nthe cupboard, saying to himself, \"What a lot of rubbish!\" Which summed\nup his opinion; for pleasures, like schoolboys in a school courtyard,\nhad so trampled upon his heart that no green thing grew there, and that\nwhich passed through it, more heedless than children, did not even, like\nthem, leave a name carved upon the wall.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"let's begin.\"\n\nHe wrote--\n\n\"Courage, Emma! courage! I would not bring misery into your life.\"\n\n\"After all, that's true,\" thought Rodolphe. \"I am acting in her\ninterest; I am honest.\"\n\n\"Have you carefully weighed your resolution? Do you know to what an\nabyss I was dragging you, poor angel? No, you do not, do you? You were\ncoming confident and fearless, believing in happiness in the future. Ah!\nunhappy that we are--insensate!\"\n\nRodolphe stopped here to think of some good excuse.\n\n\"If I told her all my fortune is lost? No! Besides, that would stop\nnothing. It would all have to be begun over again later on. As if one\ncould make women like that listen to reason!\" He reflected, then went\non--\n\n\"I shall not forget you, oh believe it; and I shall ever have a profound\ndevotion for you; but some day, sooner or later, this ardour (such is\nthe fate of human things) would have grown less, no doubt. Lassitude\nwould have come to us, and who knows if I should not even have had the\natrocious pain of witnessing your remorse, of sharing it myself, since\nI should have been its cause? The mere idea of the grief that would come\nto you tortures me, Emma. Forget me! Why did I ever know you? Why were\nyou so beautiful? Is it my fault? O my God! No, no! Accuse only fate.\"\n\n\"That's a word that always tells,\" he said to himself.\n\n\"Ah, if you had been one of those frivolous women that one sees,\ncertainly I might, through egotism, have tried an experiment, in that\ncase without danger for you. But that delicious exaltation, at once your\ncharm and your torment, has prevented you from understanding, adorable\nwoman that you are, the falseness of our future position. Nor had I\nreflected upon this at first, and I rested in the shade of that ideal\nhappiness as beneath that of the manchineel tree, without foreseeing the\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"Perhaps she'll think I'm giving it up from avarice. Ah, well! so much\nthe worse; it must be stopped!\"\n\n\"The world is cruel, Emma. Wherever we might have gone, it would have\npersecuted us. You would have had to put up with indiscreet questions,\ncalumny, contempt, insult perhaps. Insult to you! Oh! And I, who would\nplace you on a throne! I who bear with me your memory as a talisman! For\nI am going to punish myself by exile for all the ill I have done you.\nI am going away. Whither I know not. I am mad. Adieu! Be good always.\nPreserve the memory of the unfortunate who has lost you. Teach my name\nto your child; let her repeat it in her prayers.\"\n\nThe wicks of the candles flickered. Rodolphe got up to, shut the window,\nand when he had sat down again--\n\n\"I think it's all right. Ah! and this for fear she should come and hunt\nme up.\"\n\n\"I shall be far away when you read these sad lines, for I have wished to\nflee as quickly as possible to shun the temptation of seeing you again.\nNo weakness! I shall return, and perhaps later on we shall talk together\nvery coldly of our old love. Adieu!\"\n\nAnd there was a last \"adieu\" divided into two words! \"A Dieu!\" which he\nthought in very excellent taste.\n\n\"Now how am I to sign?\" he said to himself. \"'Yours devotedly?' No!\n'Your friend?' Yes, that's it.\"\n\n\"Your friend.\"\n\nHe re-read his letter. He considered it very good.\n\n\"Poor little woman!\" he thought with emotion. \"She'll think me harder\nthan a rock. There ought to have been some tears on this; but I can't\ncry; it isn't my fault.\" Then, having emptied some water into a glass,\nRodolphe dipped his finger into it, and let a big drop fall on the\npaper, that made a pale stain on the ink. Then looking for a seal, he\ncame upon the one \"Amor nel cor.\"\n\n\"That doesn't at all fit in with the circumstances. Pshaw! never mind!\"\n\nAfter which he smoked three pipes and went to bed.\n\nThe next day when he was up (at about two o'clock--he had slept late),\nRodolphe had a basket of apricots picked. He put his letter at\nthe bottom under some vine leaves, and at once ordered Girard, his\nploughman, to take it with care to Madame Bovary. He made use of this\nmeans for corresponding with her, sending according to the season fruits\nor game.\n\n\"If she asks after me,\" he said, \"you will tell her that I have gone on\na journey. You must give the basket to her herself, into her own hands.\nGet along and take care!\"\n\nGirard put on his new blouse, knotted his handkerchief round the\napricots, and walking with great heavy steps in his thick iron-bound\ngaloshes, made his way to Yonville.\n\nMadame Bovary, when he got to her house, was arranging a bundle of linen\non the kitchen-table with Felicite.\n\n\"Here,\" said the ploughboy, \"is something for you--from the master.\"\n\nShe was seized with apprehension, and as she sought in her pocket for\nsome coppers, she looked at the peasant with haggard eyes, while he\nhimself looked at her with amazement, not understanding how such a\npresent could so move anyone. At last he went out. Felicite remained.\nShe could bear it no longer; she ran into the sitting room as if to take\nthe apricots there, overturned the basket, tore away the leaves, found\nthe letter, opened it, and, as if some fearful fire were behind her,\nEmma flew to her room terrified.\n\nCharles was there; she saw him; he spoke to her; she heard nothing, and\nshe went on quickly up the stairs, breathless, distraught, dumb, and\never holding this horrible piece of paper, that crackled between her\nfingers like a plate of sheet-iron. On the second floor she stopped\nbefore the attic door, which was closed.\n\nThen she tried to calm herself; she recalled the letter; she must finish\nit; she did not dare to. And where? How? She would be seen! \"Ah, no!\nhere,\" she thought, \"I shall be all right.\"\n\nEmma pushed open the door and went in.\n\nThe slates threw straight down a heavy heat that gripped her temples,\nstifled her; she dragged herself to the closed garret-window. She drew\nback the bolt, and the dazzling light burst in with a leap.\n\nOpposite, beyond the roofs, stretched the open country till it was lost\nto sight. Down below, underneath her, the village square was empty; the\nstones of the pavement glittered, the weathercocks on the houses were\nmotionless. At the corner of the street, from a lower storey, rose a\nkind of humming with strident modulations. It was Binet turning.\n\nShe leant against the embrasure of the window, and reread the letter\nwith angry sneers. But the more she fixed her attention upon it, the\nmore confused were her ideas. She saw him again, heard him, encircled\nhim with her arms, and throbs of her heart, that beat against her breast\nlike blows of a sledge-hammer, grew faster and faster, with uneven\nintervals. She looked about her with the wish that the earth might\ncrumble into pieces. Why not end it all? What restrained her? She was\nfree. She advanced, looking at the paving-stones, saying to herself,\n\"Come! come!\"\n\nThe luminous ray that came straight up from below drew the weight of\nher body towards the abyss. It seemed to her that the ground of the\noscillating square went up the walls and that the floor dipped on\nend like a tossing boat. She was right at the edge, almost hanging,\nsurrounded by vast space. The blue of the heavens suffused her, the air\nwas whirling in her hollow head; she had but to yield, to let herself\nbe taken; and the humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice\ncalling her.\n\n\"Emma! Emma!\" cried Charles.\n\nShe stopped.\n\n\"Wherever are you? Come!\"\n\nThe thought that she had just escaped from death almost made her faint\nwith terror. She closed her eyes; then she shivered at the touch of a\nhand on her sleeve; it was Felicite.\n\n\"Master is waiting for you, madame; the soup is on the table.\"\n\nAnd she had to go down to sit at table.\n\nShe tried to eat. The food choked her. Then she unfolded her napkin as\nif to examine the darns, and she really thought of applying herself to\nthis work, counting the threads in the linen. Suddenly the remembrance\nof the letter returned to her. How had she lost it? Where could she find\nit? But she felt such weariness of spirit that she could not even invent\na pretext for leaving the table. Then she became a coward; she was\nafraid of Charles; he knew all, that was certain! Indeed he pronounced\nthese words in a strange manner:\n\n\"We are not likely to see Monsieur Rodolphe soon again, it seems.\"\n\n\"Who told you?\" she said, shuddering.\n\n\"Who told me!\" he replied, rather astonished at her abrupt tone. \"Why,\nGirard, whom I met just now at the door of the Cafe Francais. He has\ngone on a journey, or is to go.\"\n\nShe gave a sob.\n\n\"What surprises you in that? He absents himself like that from time\nto time for a change, and, ma foi, I think he's right, when one has a\nfortune and is a bachelor. Besides, he has jolly times, has our friend.\nHe's a bit of a rake. Monsieur Langlois told me--\"\n\nHe stopped for propriety's sake because the servant came in. She put\nback into the basket the apricots scattered on the sideboard. Charles,\nwithout noticing his wife's colour, had them brought to him, took one,\nand bit into it.\n\n\"Ah! perfect!\" said he; \"just taste!\"\n\nAnd he handed her the basket, which she put away from her gently.\n\n\"Do just smell! What an odour!\" he remarked, passing it under her nose\nseveral times.\n\n\"I am choking,\" she cried, leaping up. But by an effort of will the\nspasm passed; then--\n\n\"It is nothing,\" she said, \"it is nothing! It is nervousness. Sit down\nand go on eating.\" For she dreaded lest he should begin questioning her,\nattending to her, that she should not be left alone.\n\nCharles, to obey her, sat down again, and he spat the stones of the\napricots into his hands, afterwards putting them on his plate.\n\nSuddenly a blue tilbury passed across the square at a rapid trot. Emma\nuttered a cry and fell back rigid to the ground.\n\nIn fact, Rodolphe, after many reflections, had decided to set out for\nRouen. Now, as from La Huchette to Buchy there is no other way than by\nYonville, he had to go through the village, and Emma had recognised him\nby the rays of the lanterns, which like lightning flashed through the\ntwilight.\n\nThe chemist, at the tumult which broke out in the house ran thither. The\ntable with all the plates was upset; sauce, meat, knives, the salt, and\ncruet-stand were strewn over the room; Charles was calling for help;\nBerthe, scared, was crying; and Felicite, whose hands trembled, was\nunlacing her mistress, whose whole body shivered convulsively.\n\n\"I'll run to my laboratory for some aromatic vinegar,\" said the\ndruggist.\n\nThen as she opened her eyes on smelling the bottle--\n\n\"I was sure of it,\" he remarked; \"that would wake any dead person for\nyou!\"\n\n\"Speak to us,\" said Charles; \"collect yourself; it is your Charles, who\nloves you. Do you know me? See! here is your little girl! Oh, kiss her!\"\n\nThe child stretched out her arms to her mother to cling to her neck. But\nturning away her head, Emma said in a broken voice \"No, no! no one!\"\n\nShe fainted again. They carried her to her bed. She lay there stretched\nat full length, her lips apart, her eyelids closed, her hands open,\nmotionless, and white as a waxen image. Two streams of tears flowed from\nher eyes and fell slowly upon the pillow.\n\nCharles, standing up, was at the back of the alcove, and the chemist,\nnear him, maintained that meditative silence that is becoming on the\nserious occasions of life.\n\n\"Do not be uneasy,\" he said, touching his elbow; \"I think the paroxysm\nis past.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is resting a little now,\" answered Charles, watching her\nsleep. \"Poor girl! poor girl! She had gone off now!\"\n\nThen Homais asked how the accident had come about. Charles answered that\nshe had been taken ill suddenly while she was eating some apricots.\n\n\"Extraordinary!\" continued the chemist. \"But it might be that the\napricots had brought on the syncope. Some natures are so sensitive to\ncertain smells; and it would even be a very fine question to study both\nin its pathological and physiological relation. The priests know the\nimportance of it, they who have introduced aromatics into all their\nceremonies. It is to stupefy the senses and to bring on ecstasies--a\nthing, moreover, very easy in persons of the weaker sex, who are more\ndelicate than the other. Some are cited who faint at the smell of burnt\nhartshorn, of new bread--\"\n\n\"Take care; you'll wake her!\" said Bovary in a low voice.\n\n\"And not only,\" the druggist went on, \"are human beings subject to such\nanomalies, but animals also. Thus you are not ignorant of the singularly\naphrodisiac effect produced by the Nepeta cataria, vulgarly called\ncatmint, on the feline race; and, on the other hand, to quote an example\nwhose authenticity I can answer for. Bridaux (one of my old comrades, at\npresent established in the Rue Malpalu) possesses a dog that falls into\nconvulsions as soon as you hold out a snuff-box to him. He often even\nmakes the experiment before his friends at his summer-house at Guillaume\nWood. Would anyone believe that a simple sternutation could produce such\nravages on a quadrupedal organism? It is extremely curious, is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Charles, who was not listening to him.\n\n\"This shows us,\" went on the other, smiling with benign\nself-sufficiency, \"the innumerable irregularities of the nervous system.\nWith regard to madame, she has always seemed to me, I confess, very\nsusceptible. And so I should by no means recommend to you, my dear\nfriend, any of those so-called remedies that, under the pretence\nof attacking the symptoms, attack the constitution. No; no useless\nphysicking! Diet, that is all; sedatives, emollients, dulcification.\nThen, don't you think that perhaps her imagination should be worked\nupon?\"\n\n\"In what way? How?\" said Bovary.\n\n\"Ah! that is it. Such is indeed the question. 'That is the question,' as\nI lately read in a newspaper.\"\n\nBut Emma, awaking, cried out--\n\n\"The letter! the letter!\"\n\nThey thought she was delirious; and she was by midnight. Brain-fever had\nset in.\n\nFor forty-three days Charles did not leave her. He gave up all his\npatients; he no longer went to bed; he was constantly feeling her pulse,\nputting on sinapisms and cold-water compresses. He sent Justin as far as\nNeufchatel for ice; the ice melted on the way; he sent him back again.\nHe called Monsieur Canivet into consultation; he sent for Dr. Lariviere,\nhis old master, from Rouen; he was in despair. What alarmed him most was\nEmma's prostration, for she did not speak, did not listen, did not even\nseem to suffer, as if her body and soul were both resting together after\nall their troubles.\n\nAbout the middle of October she could sit up in bed supported by\npillows. Charles wept when he saw her eat her first bread-and-jelly. Her\nstrength returned to her; she got up for a few hours of an afternoon,\nand one day, when she felt better, he tried to take her, leaning on his\narm, for a walk round the garden. The sand of the paths was disappearing\nbeneath the dead leaves; she walked slowly, dragging along her slippers,\nand leaning against Charles's shoulder. She smiled all the time.\n\nThey went thus to the bottom of the garden near the terrace. She drew\nherself up slowly, shading her eyes with her hand to look. She looked\nfar off, as far as she could, but on the horizon were only great\nbonfires of grass smoking on the hills.\n\n\"You will tire yourself, my darling!\" said Bovary. And, pushing her\ngently to make her go into the arbour, \"Sit down on this seat; you'll be\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Oh! no; not there!\" she said in a faltering voice.\n\nShe was seized with giddiness, and from that evening her illness\nrecommenced, with a more uncertain character, it is true, and more\ncomplex symptoms. Now she suffered in her heart, then in the chest, the\nhead, the limbs; she had vomitings, in which Charles thought he saw the\nfirst signs of cancer.\n\nAnd besides this, the poor fellow was worried about money matters.\n\n\n\nChapter Fourteen\n\nTo begin with, he did not know how he could pay Monsieur Homais for all\nthe physic supplied by him, and though, as a medical man, he was not\nobliged to pay for it, he nevertheless blushed a little at such an\nobligation. Then the expenses of the household, now that the servant was\nmistress, became terrible. Bills rained in upon the house; the tradesmen\ngrumbled; Monsieur Lheureux especially harassed him. In fact, at\nthe height of Emma's illness, the latter, taking advantage of the\ncircumstances to make his bill larger, had hurriedly brought the cloak,\nthe travelling-bag, two trunks instead of one, and a number of other\nthings. It was very well for Charles to say he did not want them. The\ntradesman answered arrogantly that these articles had been ordered, and\nthat he would not take them back; besides, it would vex madame in her\nconvalescence; the doctor had better think it over; in short, he was\nresolved to sue him rather than give up his rights and take back his\ngoods. Charles subsequently ordered them to be sent back to the shop.\nFelicite forgot; he had other things to attend to; then thought no more\nabout them. Monsieur Lheureux returned to the charge, and, by turns\nthreatening and whining, so managed that Bovary ended by signing a\nbill at six months. But hardly had he signed this bill than a bold idea\noccurred to him: it was to borrow a thousand francs from Lheureux.\nSo, with an embarrassed air, he asked if it were possible to get them,\nadding that it would be for a year, at any interest he wished. Lheureux\nran off to his shop, brought back the money, and dictated another bill,\nby which Bovary undertook to pay to his order on the 1st of September\nnext the sum of one thousand and seventy francs, which, with the hundred\nand eighty already agreed to, made just twelve hundred and fifty, thus\nlending at six per cent in addition to one-fourth for commission: and\nthe things bringing him in a good third at the least, this ought in\ntwelve months to give him a profit of a hundred and thirty francs. He\nhoped that the business would not stop there; that the bills would not\nbe paid; that they would be renewed; and that his poor little money,\nhaving thriven at the doctor's as at a hospital, would come back to him\none day considerably more plump, and fat enough to burst his bag.\n\nEverything, moreover, succeeded with him. He was adjudicator for a\nsupply of cider to the hospital at Neufchatel; Monsieur Guillaumin\npromised him some shares in the turf-pits of Gaumesnil, and he dreamt of\nestablishing a new diligence service between Arcueil and Rouen, which\nno doubt would not be long in ruining the ramshackle van of the \"Lion\nd'Or,\" and that, travelling faster, at a cheaper rate, and carrying more\nluggage, would thus put into his hands the whole commerce of Yonville.\n\nCharles several times asked himself by what means he should next year be\nable to pay back so much money. He reflected, imagined expedients, such\nas applying to his father or selling something. But his father would be\ndeaf, and he--he had nothing to sell. Then he foresaw such worries that\nhe quickly dismissed so disagreeable a subject of meditation from\nhis mind. He reproached himself with forgetting Emma, as if, all his\nthoughts belonging to this woman, it was robbing her of something not to\nbe constantly thinking of her.\n\nThe winter was severe, Madame Bovary's convalescence slow. When it\nwas fine they wheeled her arm-chair to the window that overlooked the\nsquare, for she now had an antipathy to the garden, and the blinds on\nthat side were always down. She wished the horse to be sold; what she\nformerly liked now displeased her. All her ideas seemed to be limited to\nthe care of herself. She stayed in bed taking little meals, rang for the\nservant to inquire about her gruel or to chat with her. The snow on\nthe market-roof threw a white, still light into the room; then the rain\nbegan to fall; and Emma waited daily with a mind full of eagerness for\nthe inevitable return of some trifling events which nevertheless had no\nrelation to her. The most important was the arrival of the \"Hirondelle\"\nin the evening. Then the landlady shouted out, and other voices\nanswered, while Hippolyte's lantern, as he fetched the boxes from the\nboot, was like a star in the darkness. At mid-day Charles came in;\nthen he went out again; next she took some beef-tea, and towards five\no'clock, as the day drew in, the children coming back from school,\ndragging their wooden shoes along the pavement, knocked the clapper of\nthe shutters with their rulers one after the other.\n\nIt was at this hour that Monsieur Bournisien came to see her. He\ninquired after her health, gave her news, exhorted her to religion, in a\ncoaxing little prattle that was not without its charm. The mere thought\nof his cassock comforted her.\n\nOne day, when at the height of her illness, she had thought herself\ndying, and had asked for the communion; and, while they were making the\npreparations in her room for the sacrament, while they were turning the\nnight table covered with syrups into an altar, and while Felicite was\nstrewing dahlia flowers on the floor, Emma felt some power passing\nover her that freed her from her pains, from all perception, from\nall feeling. Her body, relieved, no longer thought; another life was\nbeginning; it seemed to her that her being, mounting toward God, would\nbe annihilated in that love like a burning incense that melts into\nvapour. The bed-clothes were sprinkled with holy water, the priest drew\nfrom the holy pyx the white wafer; and it was fainting with a celestial\njoy that she put out her lips to accept the body of the Saviour\npresented to her. The curtains of the alcove floated gently round her\nlike clouds, and the rays of the two tapers burning on the night-table\nseemed to shine like dazzling halos. Then she let her head fall back,\nfancying she heard in space the music of seraphic harps, and perceived\nin an azure sky, on a golden throne in the midst of saints holding green\npalms, God the Father, resplendent with majesty, who with a sign sent to\nearth angels with wings of fire to carry her away in their arms.\n\nThis splendid vision dwelt in her memory as the most beautiful thing\nthat it was possible to dream, so that now she strove to recall her\nsensation. That still lasted, however, but in a less exclusive fashion\nand with a deeper sweetness. Her soul, tortured by pride, at length\nfound rest in Christian humility, and, tasting the joy of weakness, she\nsaw within herself the destruction of her will, that must have left a\nwide entrance for the inroads of heavenly grace. There existed, then,\nin the place of happiness, still greater joys--another love beyond all\nloves, without pause and without end, one that would grow eternally! She\nsaw amid the illusions of her hope a state of purity floating above the\nearth mingling with heaven, to which she aspired. She wanted to become\na saint. She bought chaplets and wore amulets; she wished to have in her\nroom, by the side of her bed, a reliquary set in emeralds that she might\nkiss it every evening.\n\nThe cure marvelled at this humour, although Emma's religion, he thought,\nmight, from its fervour, end by touching on heresy, extravagance. But\nnot being much versed in these matters, as soon as they went beyond a\ncertain limit he wrote to Monsieur Boulard, bookseller to Monsignor,\nto send him \"something good for a lady who was very clever.\" The\nbookseller, with as much indifference as if he had been sending off\nhardware to niggers, packed up, pellmell, everything that was then the\nfashion in the pious book trade. There were little manuals in questions\nand answers, pamphlets of aggressive tone after the manner of Monsieur\nde Maistre, and certain novels in rose-coloured bindings and with\na honied style, manufactured by troubadour seminarists or penitent\nblue-stockings. There were the \"Think of it; the Man of the World at\nMary's Feet, by Monsieur de ***, decorated with many Orders\"; \"The\nErrors of Voltaire, for the Use of the Young,\" etc.\n\nMadame Bovary's mind was not yet sufficiently clear to apply herself\nseriously to anything; moreover, she began this reading in too much\nhurry. She grew provoked at the doctrines of religion; the arrogance\nof the polemic writings displeased her by their inveteracy in attacking\npeople she did not know; and the secular stories, relieved with\nreligion, seemed to her written in such ignorance of the world, that\nthey insensibly estranged her from the truths for whose proof she was\nlooking. Nevertheless, she persevered; and when the volume slipped\nfrom her hands, she fancied herself seized with the finest Catholic\nmelancholy that an ethereal soul could conceive.\n\nAs for the memory of Rodolphe, she had thrust it back to the bottom of\nher heart, and it remained there more solemn and more motionless than\na king's mummy in a catacomb. An exhalation escaped from this embalmed\nlove, that, penetrating through everything, perfumed with tenderness the\nimmaculate atmosphere in which she longed to live. When she knelt on her\nGothic prie-Dieu, she addressed to the Lord the same suave words that\nshe had murmured formerly to her lover in the outpourings of adultery.\nIt was to make faith come; but no delights descended from the heavens,\nand she arose with tired limbs and with a vague feeling of a gigantic\ndupery.\n\nThis searching after faith, she thought, was only one merit the more,\nand in the pride of her devoutness Emma compared herself to those grand\nladies of long ago whose glory she had dreamed of over a portrait of La\nValliere, and who, trailing with so much majesty the lace-trimmed trains\nof their long gowns, retired into solitudes to shed at the feet of\nChrist all the tears of hearts that life had wounded.\n\nThen she gave herself up to excessive charity. She sewed clothes for the\npoor, she sent wood to women in childbed; and Charles one day, on coming\nhome, found three good-for-nothings in the kitchen seated at the table\neating soup. She had her little girl, whom during her illness her\nhusband had sent back to the nurse, brought home. She wanted to teach\nher to read; even when Berthe cried, she was not vexed. She had made\nup her mind to resignation, to universal indulgence. Her language about\neverything was full of ideal expressions. She said to her child, \"Is\nyour stomach-ache better, my angel?\"\n\nMadame Bovary senior found nothing to censure except perhaps this mania\nof knitting jackets for orphans instead of mending her own house-linen;\nbut, harassed with domestic quarrels, the good woman took pleasure in\nthis quiet house, and she even stayed there till after Easter, to escape\nthe sarcasms of old Bovary, who never failed on Good Friday to order\nchitterlings.\n\nBesides the companionship of her mother-in-law, who strengthened her a\nlittle by the rectitude of her judgment and her grave ways, Emma almost\nevery day had other visitors. These were Madame Langlois, Madame Caron,\nMadame Dubreuil, Madame Tuvache, and regularly from two to five o'clock\nthe excellent Madame Homais, who, for her part, had never believed any\nof the tittle-tattle about her neighbour. The little Homais also came to\nsee her; Justin accompanied them. He went up with them to her bedroom,\nand remained standing near the door, motionless and mute. Often even\nMadame Bovary; taking no heed of him, began her toilette. She began by\ntaking out her comb, shaking her head with a quick movement, and when\nhe for the first time saw all this mass of hair that fell to her knees\nunrolling in black ringlets, it was to him, poor child! like a sudden\nentrance into something new and strange, whose splendour terrified him.\n\nEmma, no doubt, did not notice his silent attentions or his timidity.\nShe had no suspicion that the love vanished from her life was there,\npalpitating by her side, beneath that coarse holland shirt, in that\nyouthful heart open to the emanations of her beauty. Besides, she\nnow enveloped all things with such indifference, she had words so\naffectionate with looks so haughty, such contradictory ways, that one\ncould no longer distinguish egotism from charity, or corruption from\nvirtue. One evening, for example, she was angry with the servant, who\nhad asked to go out, and stammered as she tried to find some pretext.\nThen suddenly--\n\n\"So you love him?\" she said.\n\nAnd without waiting for any answer from Felicite, who was blushing, she\nadded, \"There! run along; enjoy yourself!\"\n\nIn the beginning of spring she had the garden turned up from end to end,\ndespite Bovary's remonstrances. However, he was glad to see her at last\nmanifest a wish of any kind. As she grew stronger she displayed more\nwilfulness. First, she found occasion to expel Mere Rollet, the nurse,\nwho during her convalescence had contracted the habit of coming too\noften to the kitchen with her two nurslings and her boarder, better\noff for teeth than a cannibal. Then she got rid of the Homais family,\nsuccessively dismissed all the other visitors, and even frequented\nchurch less assiduously, to the great approval of the druggist, who said\nto her in a friendly way--\n\n\"You were going in a bit for the cassock!\"\n\nAs formerly, Monsieur Bournisien dropped in every day when he came out\nafter catechism class. He preferred staying out of doors to taking the\nair \"in the grove,\" as he called the arbour. This was the time when\nCharles came home. They were hot; some sweet cider was brought out, and\nthey drank together to madame's complete restoration.\n\nBinet was there; that is to say, a little lower down against the terrace\nwall, fishing for crayfish. Bovary invited him to have a drink, and he\nthoroughly understood the uncorking of the stone bottles.\n\n\"You must,\" he said, throwing a satisfied glance all round him, even to\nthe very extremity of the landscape, \"hold the bottle perpendicularly on\nthe table, and after the strings are cut, press up the cork with\nlittle thrusts, gently, gently, as indeed they do seltzer-water at\nrestaurants.\"\n\nBut during his demonstration the cider often spurted right into their\nfaces, and then the ecclesiastic, with a thick laugh, never missed this\njoke--\n\n\"Its goodness strikes the eye!\"\n\nHe was, in fact, a good fellow and one day he was not even scandalised\nat the chemist, who advised Charles to give madame some distraction\nby taking her to the theatre at Rouen to hear the illustrious tenor,\nLagardy. Homais, surprised at this silence, wanted to know his opinion,\nand the priest declared that he considered music less dangerous for\nmorals than literature.\n\nBut the chemist took up the defence of letters. The theatre, he\ncontended, served for railing at prejudices, and, beneath a mask of\npleasure, taught virtue.\n\n\"'Castigat ridendo mores,'* Monsieur Bournisien! Thus consider the\ngreater part of Voltaire's tragedies; they are cleverly strewn with\nphilosophical reflections, that made them a vast school of morals and\ndiplomacy for the people.\"\n\n     *It corrects customs through laughter.\n\n\n\"I,\" said Binet, \"once saw a piece called the 'Gamin de Paris,' in which\nthere was the character of an old general that is really hit off to a\nT. He sets down a young swell who had seduced a working girl, who at the\nending--\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" continued Homais, \"there is bad literature as there is bad\npharmacy, but to condemn in a lump the most important of the fine arts\nseems to me a stupidity, a Gothic idea, worthy of the abominable times\nthat imprisoned Galileo.\"\n\n\"I know very well,\" objected the cure, \"that there are good works,\ngood authors. However, if it were only those persons of different sexes\nunited in a bewitching apartment, decorated rouge, those lights, those\neffeminate voices, all this must, in the long-run, engender a\ncertain mental libertinage, give rise to immodest thoughts and impure\ntemptations. Such, at any rate, is the opinion of all the Fathers.\nFinally,\" he added, suddenly assuming a mystic tone of voice while\nhe rolled a pinch of snuff between his fingers, \"if the Church has\ncondemned the theatre, she must be right; we must submit to her\ndecrees.\"\n\n\"Why,\" asked the druggist, \"should she excommunicate actors? For\nformerly they openly took part in religious ceremonies. Yes, in the\nmiddle of the chancel they acted; they performed a kind of farce called\n'Mysteries,' which often offended against the laws of decency.\"\n\nThe ecclesiastic contented himself with uttering a groan, and the\nchemist went on--\n\n\"It's like it is in the Bible; there there are, you know, more than one\npiquant detail, matters really libidinous!\"\n\nAnd on a gesture of irritation from Monsieur Bournisien--\n\n\"Ah! you'll admit that it is not a book to place in the hands of a young\ngirl, and I should be sorry if Athalie--\"\n\n\"But it is the Protestants, and not we,\" cried the other impatiently,\n\"who recommend the Bible.\"\n\n\"No matter,\" said Homais. \"I am surprised that in our days, in this\ncentury of enlightenment, anyone should still persist in proscribing an\nintellectual relaxation that is inoffensive, moralising, and sometimes\neven hygienic; is it not, doctor?\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" replied the doctor carelessly, either because, sharing the\nsame ideas, he wished to offend no one, or else because he had not any\nideas.\n\nThe conversation seemed at an end when the chemist thought fit to shoot\na Parthian arrow.\n\n\"I've known priests who put on ordinary clothes to go and see dancers\nkicking about.\"\n\n\"Come, come!\" said the cure.\n\n\"Ah! I've known some!\" And separating the words of his sentence, Homais\nrepeated, \"I--have--known--some!\"\n\n\"Well, they were wrong,\" said Bournisien, resigned to anything.\n\n\"By Jove! they go in for more than that,\" exclaimed the druggist.\n\n\"Sir!\" replied the ecclesiastic, with such angry eyes that the druggist\nwas intimidated by them.\n\n\"I only mean to say,\" he replied in less brutal a tone, \"that toleration\nis the surest way to draw people to religion.\"\n\n\"That is true! that is true!\" agreed the good fellow, sitting down again\non his chair. But he stayed only a few moments.\n\nThen, as soon as he had gone, Monsieur Homais said to the doctor--\n\n\"That's what I call a cock-fight. I beat him, did you see, in a\nway!--Now take my advice. Take madame to the theatre, if it were only\nfor once in your life, to enrage one of these ravens, hang it! If anyone\ncould take my place, I would accompany you myself. Be quick about it.\nLagardy is only going to give one performance; he's engaged to go to\nEngland at a high salary. From what I hear, he's a regular dog; he's\nrolling in money; he's taking three mistresses and a cook along with\nhim. All these great artists burn the candle at both ends; they require\na dissolute life, that suits the imagination to some extent. But they\ndie at the hospital, because they haven't the sense when young to lay\nby. Well, a pleasant dinner! Goodbye till to-morrow.\"\n\nThe idea of the theatre quickly germinated in Bovary's head, for he at\nonce communicated it to his wife, who at first refused, alleging the\nfatigue, the worry, the expense; but, for a wonder, Charles did not give\nin, so sure was he that this recreation would be good for her. He saw\nnothing to prevent it: his mother had sent them three hundred francs\nwhich he had no longer expected; the current debts were not very large,\nand the falling in of Lheureux's bills was still so far off that\nthere was no need to think about them. Besides, imagining that she\nwas refusing from delicacy, he insisted the more; so that by dint of\nworrying her she at last made up her mind, and the next day at eight\no'clock they set out in the \"Hirondelle.\"\n\nThe druggist, whom nothing whatever kept at Yonville, but who thought\nhimself bound not to budge from it, sighed as he saw them go.\n\n\"Well, a pleasant journey!\" he said to them; \"happy mortals that you\nare!\"\n\nThen addressing himself to Emma, who was wearing a blue silk gown with\nfour flounces--\n\n\"You are as lovely as a Venus. You'll cut a figure at Rouen.\"\n\nThe diligence stopped at the \"Croix-Rouge\" in the Place Beauvoisine. It\nwas the inn that is in every provincial faubourg, with large stables\nand small bedrooms, where one sees in the middle of the court chickens\npilfering the oats under the muddy gigs of the commercial travellers--a\ngood old house, with worm-eaten balconies that creak in the wind on\nwinter nights, always full of people, noise, and feeding, whose black\ntables are sticky with coffee and brandy, the thick windows made yellow\nby the flies, the damp napkins stained with cheap wine, and that always\nsmells of the village, like ploughboys dressed in Sundayclothes, has\na cafe on the street, and towards the countryside a kitchen-garden.\nCharles at once set out. He muddled up the stage-boxes with the gallery,\nthe pit with the boxes; asked for explanations, did not understand them;\nwas sent from the box-office to the acting-manager; came back to the\ninn, returned to the theatre, and thus several times traversed the whole\nlength of the town from the theatre to the boulevard.\n\nMadame Bovary bought a bonnet, gloves, and a bouquet. The doctor was\nmuch afraid of missing the beginning, and, without having had time to\nswallow a plate of soup, they presented themselves at the doors of the\ntheatre, which were still closed.\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fifteen\n\nThe crowd was waiting against the wall, symmetrically enclosed between\nthe balustrades. At the corner of the neighbouring streets huge bills\nrepeated in quaint letters \"Lucie de Lammermoor-Lagardy-Opera-etc.\" The\nweather was fine, the people were hot, perspiration trickled amid the\ncurls, and handkerchiefs taken from pockets were mopping red foreheads;\nand now and then a warm wind that blew from the river gently stirred the\nborder of the tick awnings hanging from the doors of the public-houses.\nA little lower down, however, one was refreshed by a current of icy air\nthat smelt of tallow, leather, and oil. This was an exhalation from\nthe Rue des Charrettes, full of large black warehouses where they made\ncasks.\n\nFor fear of seeming ridiculous, Emma before going in wished to have a\nlittle stroll in the harbour, and Bovary prudently kept his tickets in\nhis hand, in the pocket of his trousers, which he pressed against his\nstomach.\n\nHer heart began to beat as soon as she reached the vestibule. She\ninvoluntarily smiled with vanity on seeing the crowd rushing to the\nright by the other corridor while she went up the staircase to the\nreserved seats. She was as pleased as a child to push with her finger\nthe large tapestried door. She breathed in with all her might the\ndusty smell of the lobbies, and when she was seated in her box she bent\nforward with the air of a duchess.\n\nThe theatre was beginning to fill; opera-glasses were taken from their\ncases, and the subscribers, catching sight of one another, were bowing.\nThey came to seek relaxation in the fine arts after the anxieties of\nbusiness; but \"business\" was not forgotten; they still talked cottons,\nspirits of wine, or indigo. The heads of old men were to be seen,\ninexpressive and peaceful, with their hair and complexions looking like\nsilver medals tarnished by steam of lead. The young beaux were strutting\nabout in the pit, showing in the opening of their waistcoats their pink\nor applegreen cravats, and Madame Bovary from above admired them leaning\non their canes with golden knobs in the open palm of their yellow\ngloves.\n\nNow the lights of the orchestra were lit, the lustre, let down from the\nceiling, throwing by the glimmering of its facets a sudden gaiety over\nthe theatre; then the musicians came in one after the other; and\nfirst there was the protracted hubbub of the basses grumbling, violins\nsqueaking, cornets trumpeting, flutes and flageolets fifing. But three\nknocks were heard on the stage, a rolling of drums began, the brass\ninstruments played some chords, and the curtain rising, discovered a\ncountry-scene.\n\nIt was the cross-roads of a wood, with a fountain shaded by an oak to\nthe left. Peasants and lords with plaids on their shoulders were singing\na hunting-song together; then a captain suddenly came on, who evoked\nthe spirit of evil by lifting both his arms to heaven. Another appeared;\nthey went away, and the hunters started afresh. She felt herself\ntransported to the reading of her youth, into the midst of Walter Scott.\nShe seemed to hear through the mist the sound of the Scotch bagpipes\nre-echoing over the heather. Then her remembrance of the novel helping\nher to understand the libretto, she followed the story phrase by phrase,\nwhile vague thoughts that came back to her dispersed at once again with\nthe bursts of music. She gave herself up to the lullaby of the melodies,\nand felt all her being vibrate as if the violin bows were drawn over her\nnerves. She had not eyes enough to look at the costumes, the scenery,\nthe actors, the painted trees that shook when anyone walked, and the\nvelvet caps, cloaks, swords--all those imaginary things that floated\namid the harmony as in the atmosphere of another world. But a young\nwoman stepped forward, throwing a purse to a squire in green. She was\nleft alone, and the flute was heard like the murmur of a fountain or the\nwarbling of birds. Lucie attacked her cavatina in G major bravely. She\nplained of love; she longed for wings. Emma, too, fleeing from life,\nwould have liked to fly away in an embrace. Suddenly Edgar-Lagardy\nappeared.\n\nHe had that splendid pallor that gives something of the majesty of\nmarble to the ardent races of the South. His vigorous form was tightly\nclad in a brown-coloured doublet; a small chiselled poniard hung against\nhis left thigh, and he cast round laughing looks showing his white\nteeth. They said that a Polish princess having heard him sing one night\non the beach at Biarritz, where he mended boats, had fallen in love\nwith him. She had ruined herself for him. He had deserted her for\nother women, and this sentimental celebrity did not fail to enhance his\nartistic reputation. The diplomatic mummer took care always to slip into\nhis advertisements some poetic phrase on the fascination of his\nperson and the susceptibility of his soul. A fine organ, imperturbable\ncoolness, more temperament than intelligence, more power of emphasis\nthan of real singing, made up the charm of this admirable charlatan\nnature, in which there was something of the hairdresser and the\ntoreador.\n\nFrom the first scene he evoked enthusiasm. He pressed Lucy in his arms,\nhe left her, he came back, he seemed desperate; he had outbursts of\nrage, then elegiac gurglings of infinite sweetness, and the notes\nescaped from his bare neck full of sobs and kisses. Emma leant forward\nto see him, clutching the velvet of the box with her nails. She was\nfilling her heart with these melodious lamentations that were drawn\nout to the accompaniment of the double-basses, like the cries of the\ndrowning in the tumult of a tempest. She recognised all the intoxication\nand the anguish that had almost killed her. The voice of a prima donna\nseemed to her to be but echoes of her conscience, and this illusion that\ncharmed her as some very thing of her own life. But no one on earth had\nloved her with such love. He had not wept like Edgar that last moonlit\nnight when they said, \"To-morrow! to-morrow!\" The theatre rang with\ncheers; they recommenced the entire movement; the lovers spoke of\nthe flowers on their tomb, of vows, exile, fate, hopes; and when they\nuttered the final adieu, Emma gave a sharp cry that mingled with the\nvibrations of the last chords.\n\n\"But why,\" asked Bovary, \"does that gentleman persecute her?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" she answered; \"he is her lover!\"\n\n\"Yet he vows vengeance on her family, while the other one who came on\nbefore said, 'I love Lucie and she loves me!' Besides, he went off with\nher father arm in arm. For he certainly is her father, isn't he--the\nugly little man with a cock's feather in his hat?\"\n\nDespite Emma's explanations, as soon as the recitative duet began\nin which Gilbert lays bare his abominable machinations to his master\nAshton, Charles, seeing the false troth-ring that is to deceive Lucie,\nthought it was a love-gift sent by Edgar. He confessed, moreover, that\nhe did not understand the story because of the music, which interfered\nvery much with the words.\n\n\"What does it matter?\" said Emma. \"Do be quiet!\"\n\n\"Yes, but you know,\" he went on, leaning against her shoulder, \"I like\nto understand things.\"\n\n\"Be quiet! be quiet!\" she cried impatiently.\n\nLucie advanced, half supported by her women, a wreath of orange blossoms\nin her hair, and paler than the white satin of her gown. Emma dreamed\nof her marriage day; she saw herself at home again amid the corn in the\nlittle path as they walked to the church. Oh, why had not she, like\nthis woman, resisted, implored? She, on the contrary, had been joyous,\nwithout seeing the abyss into which she was throwing herself. Ah! if\nin the freshness of her beauty, before the soiling of marriage and the\ndisillusions of adultery, she could have anchored her life upon some\ngreat, strong heart, then virtue, tenderness, voluptuousness, and duty\nblending, she would never have fallen from so high a happiness. But that\nhappiness, no doubt, was a lie invented for the despair of all desire.\nShe now knew the smallness of the passions that art exaggerated. So,\nstriving to divert her thoughts, Emma determined now to see in this\nreproduction of her sorrows only a plastic fantasy, well enough to\nplease the eye, and she even smiled internally with disdainful pity when\nat the back of the stage under the velvet hangings a man appeared in a\nblack cloak.\n\nHis large Spanish hat fell at a gesture he made, and immediately the\ninstruments and the singers began the sextet. Edgar, flashing with fury,\ndominated all the others with his clearer voice; Ashton hurled homicidal\nprovocations at him in deep notes; Lucie uttered her shrill plaint,\nArthur at one side, his modulated tones in the middle register, and the\nbass of the minister pealed forth like an organ, while the voices of the\nwomen repeating his words took them up in chorus delightfully. They were\nall in a row gesticulating, and anger, vengeance, jealousy, terror, and\nstupefaction breathed forth at once from their half-opened mouths. The\noutraged lover brandished his naked sword; his guipure ruffle rose with\njerks to the movements of his chest, and he walked from right to left\nwith long strides, clanking against the boards the silver-gilt spurs of\nhis soft boots, widening out at the ankles. He, she thought must have an\ninexhaustible love to lavish it upon the crowd with such effusion.\nAll her small fault-findings faded before the poetry of the part\nthat absorbed her; and, drawn towards this man by the illusion of the\ncharacter, she tried to imagine to herself his life--that life resonant,\nextraordinary, splendid, and that might have been hers if fate had\nwilled it. They would have known one another, loved one another. With\nhim, through all the kingdoms of Europe she would have travelled from\ncapital to capital, sharing his fatigues and his pride, picking up the\nflowers thrown to him, herself embroidering his costumes. Then each\nevening, at the back of a box, behind the golden trellis-work she would\nhave drunk in eagerly the expansions of this soul that would have sung\nfor her alone; from the stage, even as he acted, he would have looked\nat her. But the mad idea seized her that he was looking at her; it was\ncertain. She longed to run to his arms, to take refuge in his strength,\nas in the incarnation of love itself, and to say to him, to cry out,\n\"Take me away! carry me with you! let us go! Thine, thine! all my ardour\nand all my dreams!\"\n\nThe curtain fell.\n\nThe smell of the gas mingled with that of the breaths, the waving of the\nfans, made the air more suffocating. Emma wanted to go out; the\ncrowd filled the corridors, and she fell back in her arm-chair with\npalpitations that choked her. Charles, fearing that she would faint, ran\nto the refreshment-room to get a glass of barley-water.\n\nHe had great difficulty in getting back to his seat, for his elbows were\njerked at every step because of the glass he held in his hands, and\nhe even spilt three-fourths on the shoulders of a Rouen lady in short\nsleeves, who feeling the cold liquid running down to her loins, uttered\ncries like a peacock, as if she were being assassinated. Her husband,\nwho was a millowner, railed at the clumsy fellow, and while she was with\nher handkerchief wiping up the stains from her handsome cherry-coloured\ntaffeta gown, he angrily muttered about indemnity, costs, reimbursement.\nAt last Charles reached his wife, saying to her, quite out of breath--\n\n\"Ma foi! I thought I should have had to stay there. There is such a\ncrowd--SUCH a crowd!\"\n\nHe added--\n\n\"Just guess whom I met up there! Monsieur Leon!\"\n\n\"Leon?\"\n\n\"Himself! He's coming along to pay his respects.\" And as he finished\nthese words the ex-clerk of Yonville entered the box.\n\nHe held out his hand with the ease of a gentleman; and Madame Bovary\nextended hers, without doubt obeying the attraction of a stronger will.\nShe had not felt it since that spring evening when the rain fell upon\nthe green leaves, and they had said good-bye standing at the window.\nBut soon recalling herself to the necessities of the situation, with an\neffort she shook off the torpor of her memories, and began stammering a\nfew hurried words.\n\n\"Ah, good-day! What! you here?\"\n\n\"Silence!\" cried a voice from the pit, for the third act was beginning.\n\n\"So you are at Rouen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And since when?\"\n\n\"Turn them out! turn them out!\" People were looking at them. They were\nsilent.\n\nBut from that moment she listened no more; and the chorus of the guests,\nthe scene between Ashton and his servant, the grand duet in D major, all\nwere for her as far off as if the instruments had grown less sonorous\nand the characters more remote. She remembered the games at cards at the\ndruggist's, and the walk to the nurse's, the reading in the arbour,\nthe tete-a-tete by the fireside--all that poor love, so calm and so\nprotracted, so discreet, so tender, and that she had nevertheless\nforgotten. And why had he come back? What combination of circumstances\nhad brought him back into her life? He was standing behind her, leaning\nwith his shoulder against the wall of the box; now and again she felt\nherself shuddering beneath the hot breath from his nostrils falling upon\nher hair.\n\n\"Does this amuse you?\" said he, bending over her so closely that the end\nof his moustache brushed her cheek. She replied carelessly--\n\n\"Oh, dear me, no, not much.\"\n\nThen he proposed that they should leave the theatre and go and take an\nice somewhere.\n\n\"Oh, not yet; let us stay,\" said Bovary. \"Her hair's undone; this is\ngoing to be tragic.\"\n\nBut the mad scene did not at all interest Emma, and the acting of the\nsinger seemed to her exaggerated.\n\n\"She screams too loud,\" said she, turning to Charles, who was listening.\n\n\"Yes--a little,\" he replied, undecided between the frankness of his\npleasure and his respect for his wife's opinion.\n\nThen with a sigh Leon said--\n\n\"The heat is--\"\n\n\"Unbearable! Yes!\"\n\n\"Do you feel unwell?\" asked Bovary.\n\n\"Yes, I am stifling; let us go.\"\n\nMonsieur Leon put her long lace shawl carefully about her shoulders, and\nall three went off to sit down in the harbour, in the open air, outside\nthe windows of a cafe.\n\nFirst they spoke of her illness, although Emma interrupted Charles\nfrom time to time, for fear, she said, of boring Monsieur Leon; and the\nlatter told them that he had come to spend two years at Rouen in a large\noffice, in order to get practice in his profession, which was different\nin Normandy and Paris. Then he inquired after Berthe, the Homais, Mere\nLefrancois, and as they had, in the husband's presence, nothing more to\nsay to one another, the conversation soon came to an end.\n\nPeople coming out of the theatre passed along the pavement, humming or\nshouting at the top of their voices, \"O bel ange, ma Lucie!*\" Then Leon,\nplaying the dilettante, began to talk music. He had seen Tambourini,\nRubini, Persiani, Grisi, and, compared with them, Lagardy, despite his\ngrand outbursts, was nowhere.\n\n     *Oh beautiful angel, my Lucie.\n\n\n\"Yet,\" interrupted Charles, who was slowly sipping his rum-sherbet,\n\"they say that he is quite admirable in the last act. I regret leaving\nbefore the end, because it was beginning to amuse me.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said the clerk, \"he will soon give another performance.\"\n\nBut Charles replied that they were going back next day. \"Unless,\" he\nadded, turning to his wife, \"you would like to stay alone, kitten?\"\n\nAnd changing his tactics at this unexpected opportunity that presented\nitself to his hopes, the young man sang the praises of Lagardy in the\nlast number. It was really superb, sublime. Then Charles insisted--\n\n\"You would get back on Sunday. Come, make up your mind. You are wrong if\nyou feel that this is doing you the least good.\"\n\nThe tables round them, however, were emptying; a waiter came and stood\ndiscreetly near them. Charles, who understood, took out his purse; the\nclerk held back his arm, and did not forget to leave two more pieces of\nsilver that he made chink on the marble.\n\n\"I am really sorry,\" said Bovary, \"about the money which you are--\"\n\nThe other made a careless gesture full of cordiality, and taking his hat\nsaid--\n\n\"It is settled, isn't it? To-morrow at six o'clock?\"\n\nCharles explained once more that he could not absent himself longer, but\nthat nothing prevented Emma--\n\n\"But,\" she stammered, with a strange smile, \"I am not sure--\"\n\n\"Well, you must think it over. We'll see. Night brings counsel.\" Then to\nLeon, who was walking along with them, \"Now that you are in our part of\nthe world, I hope you'll come and ask us for some dinner now and then.\"\n\nThe clerk declared he would not fail to do so, being obliged, moreover,\nto go to Yonville on some business for his office. And they parted\nbefore the Saint-Herbland Passage just as the clock in the cathedral\nstruck half-past eleven.\n\n\n\n\nPart III\n\n\n\nChapter One\n\nMonsieur Leon, while studying law, had gone pretty often to the\ndancing-rooms, where he was even a great success amongst the grisettes,\nwho thought he had a distinguished air. He was the best-mannered of the\nstudents; he wore his hair neither too long nor too short, didn't spend\nall his quarter's money on the first day of the month, and kept on good\nterms with his professors. As for excesses, he had always abstained from\nthem, as much from cowardice as from refinement.\n\nOften when he stayed in his room to read, or else when sitting of an\nevening under the lime-trees of the Luxembourg, he let his Code fall to\nthe ground, and the memory of Emma came back to him. But gradually this\nfeeling grew weaker, and other desires gathered over it, although it\nstill persisted through them all. For Leon did not lose all hope; there\nwas for him, as it were, a vague promise floating in the future, like a\ngolden fruit suspended from some fantastic tree.\n\nThen, seeing her again after three years of absence his passion\nreawakened. He must, he thought, at last make up his mind to possess\nher. Moreover, his timidity had worn off by contact with his gay\ncompanions, and he returned to the provinces despising everyone who had\nnot with varnished shoes trodden the asphalt of the boulevards. By\nthe side of a Parisienne in her laces, in the drawing-room of some\nillustrious physician, a person driving his carriage and wearing many\norders, the poor clerk would no doubt have trembled like a child; but\nhere, at Rouen, on the harbour, with the wife of this small doctor\nhe felt at his ease, sure beforehand he would shine. Self-possession\ndepends on its environment. We don't speak on the first floor as on the\nfourth; and the wealthy woman seems to have, about her, to guard her\nvirtue, all her banknotes, like a cuirass in the lining of her corset.\n\nOn leaving the Bovarys the night before, Leon had followed them\nthrough the streets at a distance; then having seen them stop at the\n\"Croix-Rouge,\" he turned on his heel, and spent the night meditating a\nplan.\n\nSo the next day about five o'clock he walked into the kitchen of the\ninn, with a choking sensation in his throat, pale cheeks, and that\nresolution of cowards that stops at nothing.\n\n\"The gentleman isn't in,\" answered a servant.\n\nThis seemed to him a good omen. He went upstairs.\n\nShe was not disturbed at his approach; on the contrary, she apologised\nfor having neglected to tell him where they were staying.\n\n\"Oh, I divined it!\" said Leon.\n\nHe pretended he had been guided towards her by chance, by, instinct. She\nbegan to smile; and at once, to repair his folly, Leon told her that he\nhad spent his morning in looking for her in all the hotels in the town\none after the other.\n\n\"So you have made up your mind to stay?\" he added.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"and I am wrong. One ought not to accustom oneself to\nimpossible pleasures when there are a thousand demands upon one.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can imagine!\"\n\n\"Ah! no; for you, you are a man!\"\n\nBut men too had had their trials, and the conversation went off into\ncertain philosophical reflections. Emma expatiated much on the misery of\nearthly affections, and the eternal isolation in which the heart remains\nentombed.\n\nTo show off, or from a naive imitation of this melancholy which called\nforth his, the young man declared that he had been awfully bored during\nthe whole course of his studies. The law irritated him, other vocations\nattracted him, and his mother never ceased worrying him in every one\nof her letters. As they talked they explained more and more fully the\nmotives of their sadness, working themselves up in their progressive\nconfidence. But they sometimes stopped short of the complete exposition\nof their thought, and then sought to invent a phrase that might express\nit all the same. She did not confess her passion for another; he did not\nsay that he had forgotten her.\n\nPerhaps he no longer remembered his suppers with girls after masked\nballs; and no doubt she did not recollect the rendezvous of old when she\nran across the fields in the morning to her lover's house. The noises\nof the town hardly reached them, and the room seemed small, as if\non purpose to hem in their solitude more closely. Emma, in a dimity\ndressing-gown, leant her head against the back of the old arm-chair; the\nyellow wall-paper formed, as it were, a golden background behind her,\nand her bare head was mirrored in the glass with the white parting in\nthe middle, and the tip of her ears peeping out from the folds of her\nhair.\n\n\"But pardon me!\" she said. \"It is wrong of me. I weary you with my\neternal complaints.\"\n\n\"No, never, never!\"\n\n\"If you knew,\" she went on, raising to the ceiling her beautiful eyes,\nin which a tear was trembling, \"all that I had dreamed!\"\n\n\"And I! Oh, I too have suffered! Often I went out; I went away. I\ndragged myself along the quays, seeking distraction amid the din of the\ncrowd without being able to banish the heaviness that weighed upon me.\nIn an engraver's shop on the boulevard there is an Italian print of one\nof the Muses. She is draped in a tunic, and she is looking at the\nmoon, with forget-me-nots in her flowing hair. Something drove me there\ncontinually; I stayed there hours together.\" Then in a trembling voice,\n\"She resembled you a little.\"\n\nMadame Bovary turned away her head that he might not see the\nirrepressible smile she felt rising to her lips.\n\n\"Often,\" he went on, \"I wrote you letters that I tore up.\"\n\nShe did not answer. He continued--\n\n\"I sometimes fancied that some chance would bring you. I thought I\nrecognised you at street-corners, and I ran after all the carriages\nthrough whose windows I saw a shawl fluttering, a veil like yours.\"\n\nShe seemed resolved to let him go on speaking without interruption.\nCrossing her arms and bending down her face, she looked at the rosettes\non her slippers, and at intervals made little movements inside the satin\nof them with her toes.\n\nAt last she sighed.\n\n\"But the most wretched thing, is it not--is to drag out, as I do, a\nuseless existence. If our pains were only of some use to someone, we\nshould find consolation in the thought of the sacrifice.\"\n\nHe started off in praise of virtue, duty, and silent immolation, having\nhimself an incredible longing for self-sacrifice that he could not\nsatisfy.\n\n\"I should much like,\" she said, \"to be a nurse at a hospital.\"\n\n\"Alas! men have none of these holy missions, and I see nowhere any\ncalling--unless perhaps that of a doctor.\"\n\nWith a slight shrug of her shoulders, Emma interrupted him to speak of\nher illness, which had almost killed her. What a pity! She should not be\nsuffering now! Leon at once envied the calm of the tomb, and one evening\nhe had even made his will, asking to be buried in that beautiful rug\nwith velvet stripes he had received from her. For this was how they\nwould have wished to be, each setting up an ideal to which they were now\nadapting their past life. Besides, speech is a rolling-mill that always\nthins out the sentiment.\n\nBut at this invention of the rug she asked, \"But why?\"\n\n\"Why?\" He hesitated. \"Because I loved you so!\" And congratulating\nhimself at having surmounted the difficulty, Leon watched her face out\nof the corner of his eyes.\n\nIt was like the sky when a gust of wind drives the clouds across. The\nmass of sad thoughts that darkened them seemed to be lifted from her\nblue eyes; her whole face shone. He waited. At last she replied--\n\n\"I always suspected it.\"\n\nThen they went over all the trifling events of that far-off existence,\nwhose joys and sorrows they had just summed up in one word. They\nrecalled the arbour with clematis, the dresses she had worn, the\nfurniture of her room, the whole of her house.\n\n\"And our poor cactuses, where are they?\"\n\n\"The cold killed them this winter.\"\n\n\"Ah! how I have thought of them, do you know? I often saw them again as\nof yore, when on the summer mornings the sun beat down upon your blinds,\nand I saw your two bare arms passing out amongst the flowers.\"\n\n\"Poor friend!\" she said, holding out her hand to him.\n\nLeon swiftly pressed his lips to it. Then, when he had taken a deep\nbreath--\n\n\"At that time you were to me I know not what incomprehensible force that\ntook captive my life. Once, for instance, I went to see you; but you, no\ndoubt, do not remember it.\"\n\n\"I do,\" she said; \"go on.\"\n\n\"You were downstairs in the ante-room, ready to go out, standing on\nthe last stair; you were wearing a bonnet with small blue flowers; and\nwithout any invitation from you, in spite of myself, I went with you.\nEvery moment, however, I grew more and more conscious of my folly, and\nI went on walking by you, not daring to follow you completely, and\nunwilling to leave you. When you went into a shop, I waited in the\nstreet, and I watched you through the window taking off your gloves and\ncounting the change on the counter. Then you rang at Madame Tuvache's;\nyou were let in, and I stood like an idiot in front of the great heavy\ndoor that had closed after you.\"\n\nMadame Bovary, as she listened to him, wondered that she was so old. All\nthese things reappearing before her seemed to widen out her life; it was\nlike some sentimental immensity to which she returned; and from time to\ntime she said in a low voice, her eyes half closed--\n\n\"Yes, it is true--true--true!\"\n\nThey heard eight strike on the different clocks of the Beauvoisine\nquarter, which is full of schools, churches, and large empty hotels.\nThey no longer spoke, but they felt as they looked upon each other a\nbuzzing in their heads, as if something sonorous had escaped from the\nfixed eyes of each of them. They were hand in hand now, and the past,\nthe future, reminiscences and dreams, all were confounded in the\nsweetness of this ecstasy. Night was darkening over the walls, on which\nstill shone, half hidden in the shade, the coarse colours of four bills\nrepresenting four scenes from the \"Tour de Nesle,\" with a motto in\nSpanish and French at the bottom. Through the sash-window a patch of\ndark sky was seen between the pointed roofs.\n\nShe rose to light two wax-candles on the drawers, then she sat down\nagain.\n\n\"Well!\" said Leon.\n\n\"Well!\" she replied.\n\nHe was thinking how to resume the interrupted conversation, when she\nsaid to him--\n\n\"How is it that no one until now has ever expressed such sentiments to\nme?\"\n\nThe clerk said that ideal natures were difficult to understand. He from\nthe first moment had loved her, and he despaired when he thought of the\nhappiness that would have been theirs, if thanks to fortune, meeting her\nearlier, they had been indissolubly bound to one another.\n\n\"I have sometimes thought of it,\" she went on.\n\n\"What a dream!\" murmured Leon. And fingering gently the blue binding of\nher long white sash, he added, \"And who prevents us from beginning now?\"\n\n\"No, my friend,\" she replied; \"I am too old; you are too young. Forget\nme! Others will love you; you will love them.\"\n\n\"Not as you!\" he cried.\n\n\"What a child you are! Come, let us be sensible. I wish it.\"\n\nShe showed him the impossibility of their love, and that they must\nremain, as formerly, on the simple terms of a fraternal friendship.\n\nWas she speaking thus seriously? No doubt Emma did not herself know,\nquite absorbed as she was by the charm of the seduction, and the\nnecessity of defending herself from it; and contemplating the young\nman with a moved look, she gently repulsed the timid caresses that his\ntrembling hands attempted.\n\n\"Ah! forgive me!\" he cried, drawing back.\n\nEmma was seized with a vague fear at this shyness, more dangerous to her\nthan the boldness of Rodolphe when he advanced to her open-armed. No man\nhad ever seemed to her so beautiful. An exquisite candour emanated from\nhis being. He lowered his long fine eyelashes, that curled upwards.\nHis cheek, with the soft skin reddened, she thought, with desire of her\nperson, and Emma felt an invincible longing to press her lips to it.\nThen, leaning towards the clock as if to see the time--\n\n\"Ah! how late it is!\" she said; \"how we do chatter!\"\n\nHe understood the hint and took up his hat.\n\n\"It has even made me forget the theatre. And poor Bovary has left me\nhere especially for that. Monsieur Lormeaux, of the Rue Grand-Pont, was\nto take me and his wife.\"\n\nAnd the opportunity was lost, as she was to leave the next day.\n\n\"Really!\" said Leon.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But I must see you again,\" he went on. \"I wanted to tell you--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Something--important--serious. Oh, no! Besides, you will not go; it is\nimpossible. If you should--listen to me. Then you have not understood\nme; you have not guessed--\"\n\n\"Yet you speak plainly,\" said Emma.\n\n\"Ah! you can jest. Enough! enough! Oh, for pity's sake, let me see you\nonce--only once!\"\n\n\"Well--\" She stopped; then, as if thinking better of it, \"Oh, not here!\"\n\n\"Where you will.\"\n\n\"Will you--\" She seemed to reflect; then abruptly, \"To-morrow at eleven\no'clock in the cathedral.\"\n\n\"I shall be there,\" he cried, seizing her hands, which she disengaged.\n\nAnd as they were both standing up, he behind her, and Emma with her head\nbent, he stooped over her and pressed long kisses on her neck.\n\n\"You are mad! Ah! you are mad!\" she said, with sounding little laughs,\nwhile the kisses multiplied.\n\nThen bending his head over her shoulder, he seemed to beg the consent of\nher eyes. They fell upon him full of an icy dignity.\n\nLeon stepped back to go out. He stopped on the threshold; then he\nwhispered with a trembling voice, \"Tomorrow!\"\n\nShe answered with a nod, and disappeared like a bird into the next room.\n\nIn the evening Emma wrote the clerk an interminable letter, in which she\ncancelled the rendezvous; all was over; they must not, for the sake of\ntheir happiness, meet again. But when the letter was finished, as she\ndid not know Leon's address, she was puzzled.\n\n\"I'll give it to him myself,\" she said; \"he will come.\"\n\nThe next morning, at the open window, and humming on his balcony, Leon\nhimself varnished his pumps with several coatings. He put on white\ntrousers, fine socks, a green coat, emptied all the scent he had into\nhis handkerchief, then having had his hair curled, he uncurled it again,\nin order to give it a more natural elegance.\n\n\"It is still too early,\" he thought, looking at the hairdresser's\ncuckoo-clock, that pointed to the hour of nine. He read an old fashion\njournal, went out, smoked a cigar, walked up three streets, thought it\nwas time, and went slowly towards the porch of Notre Dame.\n\nIt was a beautiful summer morning. Silver plate sparkled in the\njeweller's windows, and the light falling obliquely on the cathedral\nmade mirrors of the corners of the grey stones; a flock of birds\nfluttered in the grey sky round the trefoil bell-turrets; the square,\nresounding with cries, was fragrant with the flowers that bordered its\npavement, roses, jasmines, pinks, narcissi, and tube-roses, unevenly\nspaced out between moist grasses, catmint, and chickweed for the birds;\nthe fountains gurgled in the centre, and under large umbrellas, amidst\nmelons, piled up in heaps, flower-women, bare-headed, were twisting\npaper round bunches of violets.\n\nThe young man took one. It was the first time that he had bought flowers\nfor a woman, and his breast, as he smelt them, swelled with pride, as if\nthis homage that he meant for another had recoiled upon himself.\n\nBut he was afraid of being seen; he resolutely entered the church. The\nbeadle, who was just then standing on the threshold in the middle of the\nleft doorway, under the \"Dancing Marianne,\" with feather cap, and rapier\ndangling against his calves, came in, more majestic than a cardinal, and\nas shining as a saint on a holy pyx.\n\nHe came towards Leon, and, with that smile of wheedling benignity\nassumed by ecclesiastics when they question children--\n\n\"The gentleman, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? The gentleman\nwould like to see the curiosities of the church?\"\n\n\"No!\" said the other.\n\nAnd he first went round the lower aisles. Then he went out to look at\nthe Place. Emma was not coming yet. He went up again to the choir.\n\nThe nave was reflected in the full fonts with the beginning of the\narches and some portions of the glass windows. But the reflections of\nthe paintings, broken by the marble rim, were continued farther on upon\nthe flag-stones, like a many-coloured carpet. The broad daylight from\nwithout streamed into the church in three enormous rays from the three\nopened portals. From time to time at the upper end a sacristan passed,\nmaking the oblique genuflexion of devout persons in a hurry. The crystal\nlustres hung motionless. In the choir a silver lamp was burning, and\nfrom the side chapels and dark places of the church sometimes rose\nsounds like sighs, with the clang of a closing grating, its echo\nreverberating under the lofty vault.\n\nLeon with solemn steps walked along by the walls. Life had never seemed\nso good to him. She would come directly, charming, agitated, looking\nback at the glances that followed her, and with her flounced dress, her\ngold eyeglass, her thin shoes, with all sorts of elegant trifles that he\nhad never enjoyed, and with the ineffable seduction of yielding virtue.\nThe church like a huge boudoir spread around her; the arches bent down\nto gather in the shade the confession of her love; the windows shone\nresplendent to illumine her face, and the censers would burn that she\nmight appear like an angel amid the fumes of the sweet-smelling odours.\n\nBut she did not come. He sat down on a chair, and his eyes fell upon a\nblue stained window representing boatmen carrying baskets. He looked at\nit long, attentively, and he counted the scales of the fishes and the\nbutton-holes of the doublets, while his thoughts wandered off towards\nEmma.\n\nThe beadle, standing aloof, was inwardly angry at this individual who\ntook the liberty of admiring the cathedral by himself. He seemed to him\nto be conducting himself in a monstrous fashion, to be robbing him in a\nsort, and almost committing sacrilege.\n\nBut a rustle of silk on the flags, the tip of a bonnet, a lined\ncloak--it was she! Leon rose and ran to meet her.\n\nEmma was pale. She walked fast.\n\n\"Read!\" she said, holding out a paper to him. \"Oh, no!\"\n\nAnd she abruptly withdrew her hand to enter the chapel of the Virgin,\nwhere, kneeling on a chair, she began to pray.\n\nThe young man was irritated at this bigot fancy; then he nevertheless\nexperienced a certain charm in seeing her, in the middle of a\nrendezvous, thus lost in her devotions, like an Andalusian marchioness;\nthen he grew bored, for she seemed never coming to an end.\n\nEmma prayed, or rather strove to pray, hoping that some sudden\nresolution might descend to her from heaven; and to draw down divine\naid she filled full her eyes with the splendours of the tabernacle. She\nbreathed in the perfumes of the full-blown flowers in the large vases,\nand listened to the stillness of the church, that only heightened the\ntumult of her heart.\n\nShe rose, and they were about to leave, when the beadle came forward,\nhurriedly saying--\n\n\"Madame, no doubt, does not belong to these parts? Madame would like to\nsee the curiosities of the church?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\" cried the clerk.\n\n\"Why not?\" said she. For she clung with her expiring virtue to the\nVirgin, the sculptures, the tombs--anything.\n\nThen, in order to proceed \"by rule,\" the beadle conducted them right to\nthe entrance near the square, where, pointing out with his cane a large\ncircle of block-stones without inscription or carving--\n\n\"This,\" he said majestically, \"is the circumference of the beautiful\nbell of Ambroise. It weighed forty thousand pounds. There was not its\nequal in all Europe. The workman who cast it died of the joy--\"\n\n\"Let us go on,\" said Leon.\n\nThe old fellow started off again; then, having got back to the chapel of\nthe Virgin, he stretched forth his arm with an all-embracing gesture\nof demonstration, and, prouder than a country squire showing you his\nespaliers, went on--\n\n\"This simple stone covers Pierre de Breze, lord of Varenne and of\nBrissac, grand marshal of Poitou, and governor of Normandy, who died at\nthe battle of Montlhery on the 16th of July, 1465.\"\n\nLeon bit his lips, fuming.\n\n\"And on the right, this gentleman all encased in iron, on the\nprancing horse, is his grandson, Louis de Breze, lord of Breval and of\nMontchauvet, Count de Maulevrier, Baron de Mauny, chamberlain to the\nking, Knight of the Order, and also governor of Normandy; died on the\n23rd of July, 1531--a Sunday, as the inscription specifies; and below,\nthis figure, about to descend into the tomb, portrays the same person.\nIt is not possible, is it, to see a more perfect representation of\nannihilation?\"\n\nMadame Bovary put up her eyeglasses. Leon, motionless, looked at her,\nno longer even attempting to speak a single word, to make a gesture,\nso discouraged was he at this two-fold obstinacy of gossip and\nindifference.\n\nThe everlasting guide went on--\n\n\"Near him, this kneeling woman who weeps is his spouse, Diane de\nPoitiers, Countess de Breze, Duchess de Valentinois, born in 1499, died\nin 1566, and to the left, the one with the child is the Holy Virgin. Now\nturn to this side; here are the tombs of the Ambroise. They were both\ncardinals and archbishops of Rouen. That one was minister under Louis\nXII. He did a great deal for the cathedral. In his will he left thirty\nthousand gold crowns for the poor.\"\n\nAnd without stopping, still talking, he pushed them into a chapel\nfull of balustrades, some put away, and disclosed a kind of block that\ncertainly might once have been an ill-made statue.\n\n\"Truly,\" he said with a groan, \"it adorned the tomb of Richard Coeur de\nLion, King of England and Duke of Normandy. It was the Calvinists, sir,\nwho reduced it to this condition. They had buried it for spite in the\nearth, under the episcopal seat of Monsignor. See! this is the door by\nwhich Monsignor passes to his house. Let us pass on quickly to see the\ngargoyle windows.\"\n\nBut Leon hastily took some silver from his pocket and seized Emma's\narm. The beadle stood dumfounded, not able to understand this untimely\nmunificence when there were still so many things for the stranger to\nsee. So calling him back, he cried--\n\n\"Sir! sir! The steeple! the steeple!\"\n\n\"No, thank you!\" said Leon.\n\n\"You are wrong, sir! It is four hundred and forty feet high, nine less\nthan the great pyramid of Egypt. It is all cast; it--\"\n\nLeon was fleeing, for it seemed to him that his love, that for nearly\ntwo hours now had become petrified in the church like the stones, would\nvanish like a vapour through that sort of truncated funnel, of oblong\ncage, of open chimney that rises so grotesquely from the cathedral like\nthe extravagant attempt of some fantastic brazier.\n\n\"But where are we going?\" she said.\n\nMaking no answer, he walked on with a rapid step; and Madame Bovary\nwas already, dipping her finger in the holy water when behind them they\nheard a panting breath interrupted by the regular sound of a cane. Leon\nturned back.\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nAnd he recognised the beadle, holding under his arms and balancing\nagainst his stomach some twenty large sewn volumes. They were works\n\"which treated of the cathedral.\"\n\n\"Idiot!\" growled Leon, rushing out of the church.\n\nA lad was playing about the close.\n\n\"Go and get me a cab!\"\n\nThe child bounded off like a ball by the Rue Quatre-Vents; then they\nwere alone a few minutes, face to face, and a little embarrassed.\n\n\"Ah! Leon! Really--I don't know--if I ought,\" she whispered. Then with a\nmore serious air, \"Do you know, it is very improper--\"\n\n\"How so?\" replied the clerk. \"It is done at Paris.\"\n\nAnd that, as an irresistible argument, decided her.\n\nStill the cab did not come. Leon was afraid she might go back into the\nchurch. At last the cab appeared.\n\n\"At all events, go out by the north porch,\" cried the beadle, who was\nleft alone on the threshold, \"so as to see the Resurrection, the Last\nJudgment, Paradise, King David, and the Condemned in Hell-flames.\"\n\n\"Where to, sir?\" asked the coachman.\n\n\"Where you like,\" said Leon, forcing Emma into the cab.\n\nAnd the lumbering machine set out. It went down the Rue Grand-Pont,\ncrossed the Place des Arts, the Quai Napoleon, the Pont Neuf, and\nstopped short before the statue of Pierre Corneille.\n\n\"Go on,\" cried a voice that came from within.\n\nThe cab went on again, and as soon as it reached the Carrefour\nLafayette, set off down-hill, and entered the station at a gallop.\n\n\"No, straight on!\" cried the same voice.\n\nThe cab came out by the gate, and soon having reached the Cours, trotted\nquietly beneath the elm-trees. The coachman wiped his brow, put his\nleather hat between his knees, and drove his carriage beyond the side\nalley by the meadow to the margin of the waters.\n\nIt went along by the river, along the towing-path paved with sharp\npebbles, and for a long while in the direction of Oyssel, beyond the\nisles.\n\nBut suddenly it turned with a dash across Quatremares, Sotteville, La\nGrande-Chaussee, the Rue d'Elbeuf, and made its third halt in front of\nthe Jardin des Plantes.\n\n\"Get on, will you?\" cried the voice more furiously.\n\nAnd at once resuming its course, it passed by Saint-Sever, by the\nQuai'des Curandiers, the Quai aux Meules, once more over the bridge, by\nthe Place du Champ de Mars, and behind the hospital gardens, where old\nmen in black coats were walking in the sun along the terrace all green\nwith ivy. It went up the Boulevard Bouvreuil, along the Boulevard\nCauchoise, then the whole of Mont-Riboudet to the Deville hills.\n\nIt came back; and then, without any fixed plan or direction, wandered\nabout at hazard. The cab was seen at Saint-Pol, at Lescure, at Mont\nGargan, at La Rougue-Marc and Place du Gaillardbois; in the Rue\nMaladrerie, Rue Dinanderie, before Saint-Romain, Saint-Vivien,\nSaint-Maclou, Saint-Nicaise--in front of the Customs, at the \"Vieille\nTour,\" the \"Trois Pipes,\" and the Monumental Cemetery. From time to time\nthe coachman, on his box cast despairing eyes at the public-houses.\nHe could not understand what furious desire for locomotion urged these\nindividuals never to wish to stop. He tried to now and then, and at\nonce exclamations of anger burst forth behind him. Then he lashed his\nperspiring jades afresh, but indifferent to their jolting, running up\nagainst things here and there, not caring if he did, demoralised, and\nalmost weeping with thirst, fatigue, and depression.\n\nAnd on the harbour, in the midst of the drays and casks, and in the\nstreets, at the corners, the good folk opened large wonder-stricken\neyes at this sight, so extraordinary in the provinces, a cab with blinds\ndrawn, and which appeared thus constantly shut more closely than a tomb,\nand tossing about like a vessel.\n\nOnce in the middle of the day, in the open country, just as the sun\nbeat most fiercely against the old plated lanterns, a bared hand passed\nbeneath the small blinds of yellow canvas, and threw out some scraps\nof paper that scattered in the wind, and farther off lighted like white\nbutterflies on a field of red clover all in bloom.\n\nAt about six o'clock the carriage stopped in a back street of the\nBeauvoisine Quarter, and a woman got out, who walked with her veil down,\nand without turning her head.\n\n\n\nChapter Two\n\nOn reaching the inn, Madame Bovary was surprised not to see the\ndiligence. Hivert, who had waited for her fifty-three minutes, had at\nlast started.\n\nYet nothing forced her to go; but she had given her word that she would\nreturn that same evening. Moreover, Charles expected her, and in her\nheart she felt already that cowardly docility that is for some women at\nonce the chastisement and atonement of adultery.\n\nShe packed her box quickly, paid her bill, took a cab in the yard,\nhurrying on the driver, urging him on, every moment inquiring about\nthe time and the miles traversed. He succeeded in catching up the\n\"Hirondelle\" as it neared the first houses of Quincampoix.\n\nHardly was she seated in her corner than she closed her eyes, and opened\nthem at the foot of the hill, when from afar she recognised Felicite,\nwho was on the lookout in front of the farrier's shop. Hivert pulled\nin his horses and, the servant, climbing up to the window, said\nmysteriously--\n\n\"Madame, you must go at once to Monsieur Homais. It's for something\nimportant.\"\n\nThe village was silent as usual. At the corner of the streets were small\npink heaps that smoked in the air, for this was the time for jam-making,\nand everyone at Yonville prepared his supply on the same day. But in\nfront of the chemist's shop one might admire a far larger heap, and that\nsurpassed the others with the superiority that a laboratory must have\nover ordinary stores, a general need over individual fancy.\n\nShe went in. The large arm-chair was upset, and even the \"Fanal de\nRouen\" lay on the ground, outspread between two pestles. She pushed open\nthe lobby door, and in the middle of the kitchen, amid brown jars full\nof picked currants, of powdered sugar and lump sugar, of the scales on\nthe table, and of the pans on the fire, she saw all the Homais, small\nand large, with aprons reaching to their chins, and with forks in their\nhands. Justin was standing up with bowed head, and the chemist was\nscreaming--\n\n\"Who told you to go and fetch it in the Capharnaum.\"\n\n\"What is it? What is the matter?\"\n\n\"What is it?\" replied the druggist. \"We are making preserves; they are\nsimmering; but they were about to boil over, because there is too\nmuch juice, and I ordered another pan. Then he, from indolence, from\nlaziness, went and took, hanging on its nail in my laboratory, the key\nof the Capharnaum.\"\n\nIt was thus the druggist called a small room under the leads, full of\nthe utensils and the goods of his trade. He often spent long hours there\nalone, labelling, decanting, and doing up again; and he looked upon\nit not as a simple store, but as a veritable sanctuary, whence there\nafterwards issued, elaborated by his hands, all sorts of pills, boluses,\ninfusions, lotions, and potions, that would bear far and wide his\ncelebrity. No one in the world set foot there, and he respected it so,\nthat he swept it himself. Finally, if the pharmacy, open to all comers,\nwas the spot where he displayed his pride, the Capharnaum was the refuge\nwhere, egoistically concentrating himself, Homais delighted in the\nexercise of his predilections, so that Justin's thoughtlessness seemed\nto him a monstrous piece of irreverence, and, redder than the currants,\nhe repeated--\n\n\"Yes, from the Capharnaum! The key that locks up the acids and caustic\nalkalies! To go and get a spare pan! a pan with a lid! and that I\nshall perhaps never use! Everything is of importance in the delicate\noperations of our art! But, devil take it! one must make distinctions,\nand not employ for almost domestic purposes that which is meant for\npharmaceutical! It is as if one were to carve a fowl with a scalpel; as\nif a magistrate--\"\n\n\"Now be calm,\" said Madame Homais.\n\nAnd Athalie, pulling at his coat, cried \"Papa! papa!\"\n\n\"No, let me alone,\" went on the druggist \"let me alone, hang it! My\nword! One might as well set up for a grocer. That's it! go it! respect\nnothing! break, smash, let loose the leeches, burn the mallow-paste,\npickle the gherkins in the window jars, tear up the bandages!\"\n\n\"I thought you had--\" said Emma.\n\n\"Presently! Do you know to what you exposed yourself? Didn't you see\nanything in the corner, on the left, on the third shelf? Speak, answer,\narticulate something.\"\n\n\"I--don't--know,\" stammered the young fellow.\n\n\"Ah! you don't know! Well, then, I do know! You saw a bottle of blue\nglass, sealed with yellow wax, that contains a white powder, on which I\nhave even written 'Dangerous!' And do you know what is in it? Arsenic!\nAnd you go and touch it! You take a pan that was next to it!\"\n\n\"Next to it!\" cried Madame Homais, clasping her hands. \"Arsenic! You\nmight have poisoned us all.\"\n\nAnd the children began howling as if they already had frightful pains in\ntheir entrails.\n\n\"Or poison a patient!\" continued the druggist. \"Do you want to see me\nin the prisoner's dock with criminals, in a court of justice? To see\nme dragged to the scaffold? Don't you know what care I take in managing\nthings, although I am so thoroughly used to it? Often I am horrified\nmyself when I think of my responsibility; for the Government persecutes\nus, and the absurd legislation that rules us is a veritable Damocles'\nsword over our heads.\"\n\nEmma no longer dreamed of asking what they wanted her for, and the\ndruggist went on in breathless phrases--\n\n\"That is your return for all the kindness we have shown you! That is how\nyou recompense me for the really paternal care that I lavish on you! For\nwithout me where would you be? What would you be doing? Who provides\nyou with food, education, clothes, and all the means of figuring one day\nwith honour in the ranks of society? But you must pull hard at the oar\nif you're to do that, and get, as, people say, callosities upon your\nhands. Fabricando fit faber, age quod agis.*\"\n\n     * The worker lives by working, do what he will.\n\n\nHe was so exasperated he quoted Latin. He would have quoted Chinese\nor Greenlandish had he known those two languages, for he was in one\nof those crises in which the whole soul shows indistinctly what it\ncontains, like the ocean, which, in the storm, opens itself from the\nseaweeds on its shores down to the sands of its abysses.\n\nAnd he went on--\n\n\"I am beginning to repent terribly of having taken you up! I should\ncertainly have done better to have left you to rot in your poverty and\nthe dirt in which you were born. Oh, you'll never be fit for anything\nbut to herd animals with horns! You have no aptitude for science! You\nhardly know how to stick on a label! And there you are, dwelling with me\nsnug as a parson, living in clover, taking your ease!\"\n\nBut Emma, turning to Madame Homais, \"I was told to come here--\"\n\n\"Oh, dear me!\" interrupted the good woman, with a sad air, \"how am I to\ntell you? It is a misfortune!\"\n\nShe could not finish, the druggist was thundering--\"Empty it! Clean it!\nTake it back! Be quick!\"\n\nAnd seizing Justin by the collar of his blouse, he shook a book out of\nhis pocket. The lad stooped, but Homais was the quicker, and, having\npicked up the volume, contemplated it with staring eyes and open mouth.\n\n\"CONJUGAL--LOVE!\" he said, slowly separating the two words. \"Ah! very\ngood! very good! very pretty! And illustrations! Oh, this is too much!\"\n\nMadame Homais came forward.\n\n\"No, do not touch it!\"\n\nThe children wanted to look at the pictures.\n\n\"Leave the room,\" he said imperiously; and they went out.\n\nFirst he walked up and down with the open volume in his hand, rolling\nhis eyes, choking, tumid, apoplectic. Then he came straight to his\npupil, and, planting himself in front of him with crossed arms--\n\n\"Have you every vice, then, little wretch? Take care! you are on a\ndownward path. Did not you reflect that this infamous book might fall\nin the hands of my children, kindle a spark in their minds, tarnish the\npurity of Athalie, corrupt Napoleon. He is already formed like a man.\nAre you quite sure, anyhow, that they have not read it? Can you certify\nto me--\"\n\n\"But really, sir,\" said Emma, \"you wished to tell me--\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! madame. Your father-in-law is dead.\"\n\nIn fact, Monsieur Bovary senior had expired the evening before suddenly\nfrom an attack of apoplexy as he got up from table, and by way of\ngreater precaution, on account of Emma's sensibility, Charles had begged\nHomais to break the horrible news to her gradually. Homais had thought\nover his speech; he had rounded, polished it, made it rhythmical; it was\na masterpiece of prudence and transitions, of subtle turns and delicacy;\nbut anger had got the better of rhetoric.\n\nEmma, giving up all chance of hearing any details, left the pharmacy;\nfor Monsieur Homais had taken up the thread of his vituperations.\nHowever, he was growing calmer, and was now grumbling in a paternal tone\nwhilst he fanned himself with his skull-cap.\n\n\"It is not that I entirely disapprove of the work. Its author was a\ndoctor! There are certain scientific points in it that it is not ill a\nman should know, and I would even venture to say that a man must know.\nBut later--later! At any rate, not till you are man yourself and your\ntemperament is formed.\"\n\nWhen Emma knocked at the door. Charles, who was waiting for her, came\nforward with open arms and said to her with tears in his voice--\n\n\"Ah! my dear!\"\n\nAnd he bent over her gently to kiss her. But at the contact of his lips\nthe memory of the other seized her, and she passed her hand over her\nface shuddering.\n\nBut she made answer, \"Yes, I know, I know!\"\n\nHe showed her the letter in which his mother told the event without any\nsentimental hypocrisy. She only regretted her husband had not received\nthe consolations of religion, as he had died at Daudeville, in the\nstreet, at the door of a cafe after a patriotic dinner with some\nex-officers.\n\nEmma gave him back the letter; then at dinner, for appearance's sake,\nshe affected a certain repugnance. But as he urged her to try, she\nresolutely began eating, while Charles opposite her sat motionless in a\ndejected attitude.\n\nNow and then he raised his head and gave her a long look full of\ndistress. Once he sighed, \"I should have liked to see him again!\"\n\nShe was silent. At last, understanding that she must say something, \"How\nold was your father?\" she asked.\n\n\"Fifty-eight.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\nAnd that was all.\n\nA quarter of an hour after he added, \"My poor mother! what will become\nof her now?\"\n\nShe made a gesture that signified she did not know. Seeing her so\ntaciturn, Charles imagined her much affected, and forced himself to say\nnothing, not to reawaken this sorrow which moved him. And, shaking off\nhis own--\n\n\"Did you enjoy yourself yesterday?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWhen the cloth was removed, Bovary did not rise, nor did Emma; and as\nshe looked at him, the monotony of the spectacle drove little by little\nall pity from her heart. He seemed to her paltry, weak, a cipher--in\na word, a poor thing in every way. How to get rid of him? What an\ninterminable evening! Something stupefying like the fumes of opium\nseized her.\n\nThey heard in the passage the sharp noise of a wooden leg on the boards.\nIt was Hippolyte bringing back Emma's luggage. In order to put it down\nhe described painfully a quarter of a circle with his stump.\n\n\"He doesn't even remember any more about it,\" she thought, looking at\nthe poor devil, whose coarse red hair was wet with perspiration.\n\nBovary was searching at the bottom of his purse for a centime, and\nwithout appearing to understand all there was of humiliation for him\nin the mere presence of this man, who stood there like a personified\nreproach to his incurable incapacity.\n\n\"Hallo! you've a pretty bouquet,\" he said, noticing Leon's violets on\nthe chimney.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied indifferently; \"it's a bouquet I bought just now from\na beggar.\"\n\nCharles picked up the flowers, and freshening his eyes, red with tears,\nagainst them, smelt them delicately.\n\nShe took them quickly from his hand and put them in a glass of water.\n\nThe next day Madame Bovary senior arrived. She and her son wept much.\nEmma, on the pretext of giving orders, disappeared. The following day\nthey had a talk over the mourning. They went and sat down with their\nworkboxes by the waterside under the arbour.\n\nCharles was thinking of his father, and was surprised to feel so much\naffection for this man, whom till then he had thought he cared little\nabout. Madame Bovary senior was thinking of her husband. The worst\ndays of the past seemed enviable to her. All was forgotten beneath the\ninstinctive regret of such a long habit, and from time to time whilst\nshe sewed, a big tear rolled along her nose and hung suspended there a\nmoment. Emma was thinking that it was scarcely forty-eight hours since\nthey had been together, far from the world, all in a frenzy of joy, and\nnot having eyes enough to gaze upon each other. She tried to recall the\nslightest details of that past day. But the presence of her husband and\nmother-in-law worried her. She would have liked to hear nothing, to see\nnothing, so as not to disturb the meditation on her love, that, do what\nshe would, became lost in external sensations.\n\nShe was unpicking the lining of a dress, and the strips were scattered\naround her. Madame Bovary senior was plying her scissor without looking\nup, and Charles, in his list slippers and his old brown surtout that he\nused as a dressing-gown, sat with both hands in his pockets, and did not\nspeak either; near them Berthe, in a little white pinafore, was raking\nsand in the walks with her spade. Suddenly she saw Monsieur Lheureux,\nthe linendraper, come in through the gate.\n\nHe came to offer his services \"under the sad circumstances.\" Emma\nanswered that she thought she could do without. The shopkeeper was not\nto be beaten.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, \"but I should like to have a private talk\nwith you.\" Then in a low voice, \"It's about that affair--you know.\"\n\nCharles crimsoned to his ears. \"Oh, yes! certainly.\" And in his\nconfusion, turning to his wife, \"Couldn't you, my darling?\"\n\nShe seemed to understand him, for she rose; and Charles said to his\nmother, \"It is nothing particular. No doubt, some household trifle.\" He\ndid not want her to know the story of the bill, fearing her reproaches.\n\nAs soon as they were alone, Monsieur Lheureux in sufficiently clear\nterms began to congratulate Emma on the inheritance, then to talk of\nindifferent matters, of the espaliers, of the harvest, and of his own\nhealth, which was always so-so, always having ups and downs. In fact, he\nhad to work devilish hard, although he didn't make enough, in spite of\nall people said, to find butter for his bread.\n\nEmma let him talk on. She had bored herself so prodigiously the last two\ndays.\n\n\"And so you're quite well again?\" he went on. \"Ma foi! I saw your\nhusband in a sad state. He's a good fellow, though we did have a little\nmisunderstanding.\"\n\nShe asked what misunderstanding, for Charles had said nothing of the\ndispute about the goods supplied to her.\n\n\"Why, you know well enough,\" cried Lheureux. \"It was about your little\nfancies--the travelling trunks.\"\n\nHe had drawn his hat over his eyes, and, with his hands behind his\nback, smiling and whistling, he looked straight at her in an unbearable\nmanner. Did he suspect anything?\n\nShe was lost in all kinds of apprehensions. At last, however, he went\non--\n\n\"We made it up, all the same, and I've come again to propose another\narrangement.\"\n\nThis was to renew the bill Bovary had signed. The doctor, of course,\nwould do as he pleased; he was not to trouble himself, especially just\nnow, when he would have a lot of worry. \"And he would do better to give\nit over to someone else--to you, for example. With a power of attorney\nit could be easily managed, and then we (you and I) would have our\nlittle business transactions together.\"\n\nShe did not understand. He was silent. Then, passing to his trade,\nLheureux declared that madame must require something. He would send her\na black barege, twelve yards, just enough to make a gown.\n\n\"The one you've on is good enough for the house, but you want another\nfor calls. I saw that the very moment that I came in. I've the eye of an\nAmerican!\"\n\nHe did not send the stuff; he brought it. Then he came again to measure\nit; he came again on other pretexts, always trying to make himself\nagreeable, useful, \"enfeoffing himself,\" as Homais would have said, and\nalways dropping some hint to Emma about the power of attorney. He never\nmentioned the bill; she did not think of it. Charles, at the beginning\nof her convalescence, had certainly said something about it to her,\nbut so many emotions had passed through her head that she no longer\nremembered it. Besides, she took care not to talk of any money\nquestions. Madame Bovary seemed surprised at this, and attributed the\nchange in her ways to the religious sentiments she had contracted during\nher illness.\n\nBut as soon as she was gone, Emma greatly astounded Bovary by her\npractical good sense. It would be necessary to make inquiries, to look\ninto mortgages, and see if there were any occasion for a sale by auction\nor a liquidation. She quoted technical terms casually, pronounced the\ngrand words of order, the future, foresight, and constantly exaggerated\nthe difficulties of settling his father's affairs so much, that at last\none day she showed him the rough draft of a power of attorney to manage\nand administer his business, arrange all loans, sign and endorse all\nbills, pay all sums, etc. She had profited by Lheureux's lessons.\nCharles naively asked her where this paper came from.\n\n\"Monsieur Guillaumin\"; and with the utmost coolness she added, \"I don't\ntrust him overmuch. Notaries have such a bad reputation. Perhaps we\nought to consult--we only know--no one.\"\n\n\"Unless Leon--\" replied Charles, who was reflecting. But it was\ndifficult to explain matters by letter. Then she offered to make the\njourney, but he thanked her. She insisted. It was quite a contest of\nmutual consideration. At last she cried with affected waywardness--\n\n\"No, I will go!\"\n\n\"How good you are!\" he said, kissing her forehead.\n\nThe next morning she set out in the \"Hirondelle\" to go to Rouen to\nconsult Monsieur Leon, and she stayed there three days.\n\n\n\nChapter Three\n\nThey were three full, exquisite days--a true honeymoon. They were at\nthe Hotel-de-Boulogne, on the harbour; and they lived there, with drawn\nblinds and closed doors, with flowers on the floor, and iced syrups were\nbrought them early in the morning.\n\nTowards evening they took a covered boat and went to dine on one of the\nislands. It was the time when one hears by the side of the dockyard the\ncaulking-mallets sounding against the hull of vessels. The smoke of\nthe tar rose up between the trees; there were large fatty drops on the\nwater, undulating in the purple colour of the sun, like floating plaques\nof Florentine bronze.\n\nThey rowed down in the midst of moored boats, whose long oblique cables\ngrazed lightly against the bottom of the boat. The din of the town\ngradually grew distant; the rolling of carriages, the tumult of voices,\nthe yelping of dogs on the decks of vessels. She took off her bonnet,\nand they landed on their island.\n\nThey sat down in the low-ceilinged room of a tavern, at whose door hung\nblack nets. They ate fried smelts, cream and cherries. They lay down\nupon the grass; they kissed behind the poplars; and they would fain,\nlike two Robinsons, have lived for ever in this little place, which\nseemed to them in their beatitude the most magnificent on earth. It was\nnot the first time that they had seen trees, a blue sky, meadows; that\nthey had heard the water flowing and the wind blowing in the leaves;\nbut, no doubt, they had never admired all this, as if Nature had\nnot existed before, or had only begun to be beautiful since the\ngratification of their desires.\n\nAt night they returned. The boat glided along the shores of the islands.\nThey sat at the bottom, both hidden by the shade, in silence. The square\noars rang in the iron thwarts, and, in the stillness, seemed to mark\ntime, like the beating of a metronome, while at the stern the rudder\nthat trailed behind never ceased its gentle splash against the water.\n\nOnce the moon rose; they did not fail to make fine phrases, finding the\norb melancholy and full of poetry. She even began to sing--\n\n\"One night, do you remember, we were sailing,\" etc.\n\nHer musical but weak voice died away along the waves, and the winds\ncarried off the trills that Leon heard pass like the flapping of wings\nabout him.\n\nShe was opposite him, leaning against the partition of the shallop,\nthrough one of whose raised blinds the moon streamed in. Her black\ndress, whose drapery spread out like a fan, made her seem more slender,\ntaller. Her head was raised, her hands clasped, her eyes turned towards\nheaven. At times the shadow of the willows hid her completely; then she\nreappeared suddenly, like a vision in the moonlight.\n\nLeon, on the floor by her side, found under his hand a ribbon of scarlet\nsilk. The boatman looked at it, and at last said--\n\n\"Perhaps it belongs to the party I took out the other day. A lot\nof jolly folk, gentlemen and ladies, with cakes, champagne,\ncornets--everything in style! There was one especially, a tall handsome\nman with small moustaches, who was that funny! And they all kept saying,\n'Now tell us something, Adolphe--Dolpe,' I think.\"\n\nShe shivered.\n\n\"You are in pain?\" asked Leon, coming closer to her.\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing! No doubt, it is only the night air.\"\n\n\"And who doesn't want for women, either,\" softly added the sailor,\nthinking he was paying the stranger a compliment.\n\nThen, spitting on his hands, he took the oars again.\n\nYet they had to part. The adieux were sad. He was to send his letters to\nMere Rollet, and she gave him such precise instructions about a double\nenvelope that he admired greatly her amorous astuteness.\n\n\"So you can assure me it is all right?\" she said with her last kiss.\n\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"But why,\" he thought afterwards as he came back through the streets\nalone, \"is she so very anxious to get this power of attorney?\"\n\n\n\nChapter Four\n\nLeon soon put on an air of superiority before his comrades, avoided\ntheir company, and completely neglected his work.\n\nHe waited for her letters; he re-read them; he wrote to her. He called\nher to mind with all the strength of his desires and of his memories.\nInstead of lessening with absence, this longing to see her again grew,\nso that at last on Saturday morning he escaped from his office.\n\nWhen, from the summit of the hill, he saw in the valley below the\nchurch-spire with its tin flag swinging in the wind, he felt that\ndelight mingled with triumphant vanity and egoistic tenderness that\nmillionaires must experience when they come back to their native\nvillage.\n\nHe went rambling round her house. A light was burning in the kitchen. He\nwatched for her shadow behind the curtains, but nothing appeared.\n\nMere Lefrancois, when she saw him, uttered many exclamations. She\nthought he \"had grown and was thinner,\" while Artemise, on the contrary,\nthought him stouter and darker.\n\nHe dined in the little room as of yore, but alone, without the\ntax-gatherer; for Binet, tired of waiting for the \"Hirondelle,\" had\ndefinitely put forward his meal one hour, and now he dined punctually at\nfive, and yet he declared usually the rickety old concern \"was late.\"\n\nLeon, however, made up his mind, and knocked at the doctor's door.\nMadame was in her room, and did not come down for a quarter of an hour.\nThe doctor seemed delighted to see him, but he never stirred out that\nevening, nor all the next day.\n\nHe saw her alone in the evening, very late, behind the garden in the\nlane; in the lane, as she had the other one! It was a stormy night, and\nthey talked under an umbrella by lightning flashes.\n\nTheir separation was becoming intolerable. \"I would rather die!\" said\nEmma. She was writhing in his arms, weeping. \"Adieu! adieu! When shall I\nsee you again?\"\n\nThey came back again to embrace once more, and it was then that\nshe promised him to find soon, by no matter what means, a regular\nopportunity for seeing one another in freedom at least once a week. Emma\nnever doubted she should be able to do this. Besides, she was full of\nhope. Some money was coming to her.\n\nOn the strength of it she bought a pair of yellow curtains with large\nstripes for her room, whose cheapness Monsieur Lheureux had commended;\nshe dreamed of getting a carpet, and Lheureux, declaring that it wasn't\n\"drinking the sea,\" politely undertook to supply her with one. She could\nno longer do without his services. Twenty times a day she sent for him,\nand he at once put by his business without a murmur. People could not\nunderstand either why Mere Rollet breakfasted with her every day, and\neven paid her private visits.\n\nIt was about this time, that is to say, the beginning of winter, that\nshe seemed seized with great musical fervour.\n\nOne evening when Charles was listening to her, she began the same piece\nfour times over, each time with much vexation, while he, not noticing\nany difference, cried--\n\n\"Bravo! very goodl You are wrong to stop. Go on!\"\n\n\"Oh, no; it is execrable! My fingers are quite rusty.\"\n\nThe next day he begged her to play him something again.\n\n\"Very well; to please you!\"\n\nAnd Charles confessed she had gone off a little. She played wrong notes\nand blundered; then, stopping short--\n\n\"Ah! it is no use. I ought to take some lessons; but--\" She bit her lips\nand added, \"Twenty francs a lesson, that's too dear!\"\n\n\"Yes, so it is--rather,\" said Charles, giggling stupidly. \"But it seems\nto me that one might be able to do it for less; for there are artists of\nno reputation, and who are often better than the celebrities.\"\n\n\"Find them!\" said Emma.\n\nThe next day when he came home he looked at her shyly, and at last could\nno longer keep back the words.\n\n\"How obstinate you are sometimes! I went to Barfucheres to-day. Well,\nMadame Liegard assured me that her three young ladies who are at\nLa Misericorde have lessons at fifty sous apiece, and that from an\nexcellent mistress!\"\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders and did not open her piano again. But when\nshe passed by it (if Bovary were there), she sighed--\n\n\"Ah! my poor piano!\"\n\nAnd when anyone came to see her, she did not fail to inform them she\nhad given up music, and could not begin again now for important reasons.\nThen people commiserated her--\n\n\"What a pity! she had so much talent!\"\n\nThey even spoke to Bovary about it. They put him to shame, and\nespecially the chemist.\n\n\"You are wrong. One should never let any of the faculties of nature lie\nfallow. Besides, just think, my good friend, that by inducing madame to\nstudy; you are economising on the subsequent musical education of\nyour child. For my own part, I think that mothers ought themselves to\ninstruct their children. That is an idea of Rousseau's, still rather\nnew perhaps, but that will end by triumphing, I am certain of it, like\nmothers nursing their own children and vaccination.\"\n\nSo Charles returned once more to this question of the piano. Emma\nreplied bitterly that it would be better to sell it. This poor piano,\nthat had given her vanity so much satisfaction--to see it go was to\nBovary like the indefinable suicide of a part of herself.\n\n\"If you liked,\" he said, \"a lesson from time to time, that wouldn't\nafter all be very ruinous.\"\n\n\"But lessons,\" she replied, \"are only of use when followed up.\"\n\nAnd thus it was she set about obtaining her husband's permission to go\nto town once a week to see her lover. At the end of a month she was even\nconsidered to have made considerable progress.\n\n\n\nChapter Five\n\nShe went on Thursdays. She got up and dressed silently, in order not to\nawaken Charles, who would have made remarks about her getting ready too\nearly. Next she walked up and down, went to the windows, and looked out\nat the Place. The early dawn was broadening between the pillars of the\nmarket, and the chemist's shop, with the shutters still up, showed in\nthe pale light of the dawn the large letters of his signboard.\n\nWhen the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she went off to the\n\"Lion d'Or,\" whose door Artemise opened yawning. The girl then made\nup the coals covered by the cinders, and Emma remained alone in the\nkitchen. Now and again she went out. Hivert was leisurely harnessing his\nhorses, listening, moreover, to Mere Lefrancois, who, passing her head\nand nightcap through a grating, was charging him with commissions and\ngiving him explanations that would have confused anyone else. Emma kept\nbeating the soles of her boots against the pavement of the yard.\n\nAt last, when he had eaten his soup, put on his cloak, lighted his pipe,\nand grasped his whip, he calmly installed himself on his seat.\n\nThe \"Hirondelle\" started at a slow trot, and for about a mile stopped\nhere and there to pick up passengers who waited for it, standing at the\nborder of the road, in front of their yard gates.\n\nThose who had secured seats the evening before kept it waiting; some\neven were still in bed in their houses. Hivert called, shouted, swore;\nthen he got down from his seat and went and knocked loudly at the doors.\nThe wind blew through the cracked windows.\n\nThe four seats, however, filled up. The carriage rolled off; rows of\napple-trees followed one upon another, and the road between its two long\nditches, full of yellow water, rose, constantly narrowing towards the\nhorizon.\n\nEmma knew it from end to end; she knew that after a meadow there was\na sign-post, next an elm, a barn, or the hut of a lime-kiln tender.\nSometimes even, in the hope of getting some surprise, she shut her eyes,\nbut she never lost the clear perception of the distance to be traversed.\n\nAt last the brick houses began to follow one another more closely, the\nearth resounded beneath the wheels, the \"Hirondelle\" glided between the\ngardens, where through an opening one saw statues, a periwinkle plant,\nclipped yews, and a swing. Then on a sudden the town appeared. Sloping\ndown like an amphitheatre, and drowned in the fog, it widened out\nbeyond the bridges confusedly. Then the open country spread away with\na monotonous movement till it touched in the distance the vague line of\nthe pale sky. Seen thus from above, the whole landscape looked immovable\nas a picture; the anchored ships were massed in one corner, the river\ncurved round the foot of the green hills, and the isles, oblique in\nshape, lay on the water, like large, motionless, black fishes. The\nfactory chimneys belched forth immense brown fumes that were blown away\nat the top. One heard the rumbling of the foundries, together with the\nclear chimes of the churches that stood out in the mist. The leafless\ntrees on the boulevards made violet thickets in the midst of the\nhouses, and the roofs, all shining with the rain, threw back unequal\nreflections, according to the height of the quarters in which they were.\nSometimes a gust of wind drove the clouds towards the Saint Catherine\nhills, like aerial waves that broke silently against a cliff.\n\nA giddiness seemed to her to detach itself from this mass of existence,\nand her heart swelled as if the hundred and twenty thousand souls that\npalpitated there had all at once sent into it the vapour of the passions\nshe fancied theirs. Her love grew in the presence of this vastness, and\nexpanded with tumult to the vague murmurings that rose towards her. She\npoured it out upon the square, on the walks, on the streets, and the\nold Norman city outspread before her eyes as an enormous capital, as a\nBabylon into which she was entering. She leant with both hands against\nthe window, drinking in the breeze; the three horses galloped, the\nstones grated in the mud, the diligence rocked, and Hivert, from afar,\nhailed the carts on the road, while the bourgeois who had spent the\nnight at the Guillaume woods came quietly down the hill in their little\nfamily carriages.\n\nThey stopped at the barrier; Emma undid her overshoes, put on other\ngloves, rearranged her shawl, and some twenty paces farther she got down\nfrom the \"Hirondelle.\"\n\nThe town was then awakening. Shop-boys in caps were cleaning up the\nshop-fronts, and women with baskets against their hips, at intervals\nuttered sonorous cries at the corners of streets. She walked with\ndowncast eyes, close to the walls, and smiling with pleasure under her\nlowered black veil.\n\nFor fear of being seen, she did not usually take the most direct road.\nShe plunged into dark alleys, and, all perspiring, reached the bottom\nof the Rue Nationale, near the fountain that stands there. It is the\nquarter for theatres, public-houses, and whores. Often a cart would\npass near her, bearing some shaking scenery. Waiters in aprons were\nsprinkling sand on the flagstones between green shrubs. It all smelt of\nabsinthe, cigars, and oysters.\n\nShe turned down a street; she recognised him by his curling hair that\nescaped from beneath his hat.\n\nLeon walked along the pavement. She followed him to the hotel. He went\nup, opened the door, entered--What an embrace!\n\nThen, after the kisses, the words gushed forth. They told each other the\nsorrows of the week, the presentiments, the anxiety for the letters; but\nnow everything was forgotten; they gazed into each other's faces with\nvoluptuous laughs, and tender names.\n\nThe bed was large, of mahogany, in the shape of a boat. The curtains\nwere in red levantine, that hung from the ceiling and bulged out too\nmuch towards the bell-shaped bedside; and nothing in the world was so\nlovely as her brown head and white skin standing out against this purple\ncolour, when, with a movement of shame, she crossed her bare arms,\nhiding her face in her hands.\n\nThe warm room, with its discreet carpet, its gay ornaments, and its\ncalm light, seemed made for the intimacies of passion. The curtain-rods,\nending in arrows, their brass pegs, and the great balls of the fire-dogs\nshone suddenly when the sun came in. On the chimney between the\ncandelabra there were two of those pink shells in which one hears the\nmurmur of the sea if one holds them to the ear.\n\nHow they loved that dear room, so full of gaiety, despite its rather\nfaded splendour! They always found the furniture in the same place, and\nsometimes hairpins, that she had forgotten the Thursday before, under\nthe pedestal of the clock. They lunched by the fireside on a little\nround table, inlaid with rosewood. Emma carved, put bits on his plate\nwith all sorts of coquettish ways, and she laughed with a sonorous and\nlibertine laugh when the froth of the champagne ran over from the\nglass to the rings on her fingers. They were so completely lost in\nthe possession of each other that they thought themselves in their\nown house, and that they would live there till death, like two spouses\neternally young. They said \"our room,\" \"our carpet,\" she even said \"my\nslippers,\" a gift of Leon's, a whim she had had. They were pink satin,\nbordered with swansdown. When she sat on his knees, her leg, then too\nshort, hung in the air, and the dainty shoe, that had no back to it, was\nheld only by the toes to her bare foot.\n\nHe for the first time enjoyed the inexpressible delicacy of feminine\nrefinements. He had never met this grace of language, this reserve of\nclothing, these poses of the weary dove. He admired the exaltation of\nher soul and the lace on her petticoat. Besides, was she not \"a lady\"\nand a married woman--a real mistress, in fine?\n\nBy the diversity of her humour, in turn mystical or mirthful, talkative,\ntaciturn, passionate, careless, she awakened in him a thousand desires,\ncalled up instincts or memories. She was the mistress of all the novels,\nthe heroine of all the dramas, the vague \"she\" of all the volumes\nof verse. He found again on her shoulder the amber colouring of the\n\"Odalisque Bathing\"; she had the long waist of feudal chatelaines, and\nshe resembled the \"Pale Woman of Barcelona.\" But above all she was the\nAngel!\n\nOften looking at her, it seemed to him that his soul, escaping towards\nher, spread like a wave about the outline of her head, and descended\ndrawn down into the whiteness of her breast. He knelt on the ground\nbefore her, and with both elbows on her knees looked at her with a\nsmile, his face upturned.\n\nShe bent over him, and murmured, as if choking with intoxication--\n\n\"Oh, do not move! do not speak! look at me! Something so sweet comes\nfrom your eyes that helps me so much!\"\n\nShe called him \"child.\" \"Child, do you love me?\"\n\nAnd she did not listen for his answer in the haste of her lips that\nfastened to his mouth.\n\nOn the clock there was a bronze cupid, who smirked as he bent his arm\nbeneath a golden garland. They had laughed at it many a time, but when\nthey had to part everything seemed serious to them.\n\nMotionless in front of each other, they kept repeating, \"Till Thursday,\ntill Thursday.\"\n\nSuddenly she seized his head between her hands, kissed him hurriedly on\nthe forehead, crying, \"Adieu!\" and rushed down the stairs.\n\nShe went to a hairdresser's in the Rue de la Comedie to have her hair\narranged. Night fell; the gas was lighted in the shop. She heard the\nbell at the theatre calling the mummers to the performance, and she saw,\npassing opposite, men with white faces and women in faded gowns going in\nat the stage-door.\n\nIt was hot in the room, small, and too low where the stove was hissing\nin the midst of wigs and pomades. The smell of the tongs, together with\nthe greasy hands that handled her head, soon stunned her, and she dozed\na little in her wrapper. Often, as he did her hair, the man offered her\ntickets for a masked ball.\n\nThen she went away. She went up the streets; reached the Croix-Rouge,\nput on her overshoes, that she had hidden in the morning under the seat,\nand sank into her place among the impatient passengers. Some got out\nat the foot of the hill. She remained alone in the carriage. At every\nturning all the lights of the town were seen more and more completely,\nmaking a great luminous vapour about the dim houses. Emma knelt on the\ncushions and her eyes wandered over the dazzling light. She sobbed;\ncalled on Leon, sent him tender words and kisses lost in the wind.\n\nOn the hillside a poor devil wandered about with his stick in the midst\nof the diligences. A mass of rags covered his shoulders, and an old\nstaved-in beaver, turned out like a basin, hid his face; but when he\ntook it off he discovered in the place of eyelids empty and bloody\norbits. The flesh hung in red shreds, and there flowed from it liquids\nthat congealed into green scale down to the nose, whose black nostrils\nsniffed convulsively. To speak to you he threw back his head with an\nidiotic laugh; then his bluish eyeballs, rolling constantly, at the\ntemples beat against the edge of the open wound. He sang a little song\nas he followed the carriages--\n\n\"Maids an the warmth of a summer day Dream of love, and of love always\"\n\nAnd all the rest was about birds and sunshine and green leaves.\n\nSometimes he appeared suddenly behind Emma, bareheaded, and she drew\nback with a cry. Hivert made fun of him. He would advise him to get a\nbooth at the Saint Romain fair, or else ask him, laughing, how his young\nwoman was.\n\nOften they had started when, with a sudden movement, his hat entered the\ndiligence through the small window, while he clung with his other arm\nto the footboard, between the wheels splashing mud. His voice, feeble\nat first and quavering, grew sharp; it resounded in the night like the\nindistinct moan of a vague distress; and through the ringing of the\nbells, the murmur of the trees, and the rumbling of the empty vehicle,\nit had a far-off sound that disturbed Emma. It went to the bottom of\nher soul, like a whirlwind in an abyss, and carried her away into the\ndistances of a boundless melancholy. But Hivert, noticing a weight\nbehind, gave the blind man sharp cuts with his whip. The thong lashed\nhis wounds, and he fell back into the mud with a yell. Then the\npassengers in the \"Hirondelle\" ended by falling asleep, some with open\nmouths, others with lowered chins, leaning against their neighbour's\nshoulder, or with their arm passed through the strap, oscillating\nregularly with the jolting of the carriage; and the reflection of the\nlantern swinging without, on the crupper of the wheeler; penetrating\ninto the interior through the chocolate calico curtains, threw\nsanguineous shadows over all these motionless people. Emma, drunk with\ngrief, shivered in her clothes, feeling her feet grow colder and colder,\nand death in her soul.\n\nCharles at home was waiting for her; the \"Hirondelle\" was always late\non Thursdays. Madame arrived at last, and scarcely kissed the child. The\ndinner was not ready. No matter! She excused the servant. This girl now\nseemed allowed to do just as she liked.\n\nOften her husband, noting her pallor, asked if she were unwell.\n\n\"No,\" said Emma.\n\n\"But,\" he replied, \"you seem so strange this evening.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing! nothing!\"\n\nThere were even days when she had no sooner come in than she went up to\nher room; and Justin, happening to be there, moved about noiselessly,\nquicker at helping her than the best of maids. He put the matches\nready, the candlestick, a book, arranged her nightgown, turned back the\nbedclothes.\n\n\"Come!\" said she, \"that will do. Now you can go.\"\n\nFor he stood there, his hands hanging down and his eyes wide open, as if\nenmeshed in the innumerable threads of a sudden reverie.\n\nThe following day was frightful, and those that came after still more\nunbearable, because of her impatience to once again seize her happiness;\nan ardent lust, inflamed by the images of past experience, and that\nburst forth freely on the seventh day beneath Leon's caresses. His\nardours were hidden beneath outbursts of wonder and gratitude. Emma\ntasted this love in a discreet, absorbed fashion, maintained it by all\nthe artifices of her tenderness, and trembled a little lest it should be\nlost later on.\n\nShe often said to him, with her sweet, melancholy voice--\n\n\"Ah! you too, you will leave me! You will marry! You will be like all\nthe others.\"\n\nHe asked, \"What others?\"\n\n\"Why, like all men,\" she replied. Then added, repulsing him with a\nlanguid movement--\n\n\"You are all evil!\"\n\nOne day, as they were talking philosophically of earthly disillusions,\nto experiment on his jealousy, or yielding, perhaps, to an over-strong\nneed to pour out her heart, she told him that formerly, before him, she\nhad loved someone.\n\n\"Not like you,\" she went on quickly, protesting by the head of her child\nthat \"nothing had passed between them.\"\n\nThe young man believed her, but none the less questioned her to find out\nwhat he was.\n\n\"He was a ship's captain, my dear.\"\n\nWas this not preventing any inquiry, and, at the same time, assuming a\nhigher ground through this pretended fascination exercised over a man\nwho must have been of warlike nature and accustomed to receive homage?\n\nThe clerk then felt the lowliness of his position; he longed for\nepaulettes, crosses, titles. All that would please her--he gathered that\nfrom her spendthrift habits.\n\nEmma nevertheless concealed many of these extravagant fancies, such as\nher wish to have a blue tilbury to drive into Rouen, drawn by an English\nhorse and driven by a groom in top-boots. It was Justin who had inspired\nher with this whim, by begging her to take him into her service as\nvalet-de-chambre*, and if the privation of it did not lessen the\npleasure of her arrival at each rendezvous, it certainly augmented the\nbitterness of the return.\n\n     * Manservant.\n\n\nOften, when they talked together of Paris, she ended by murmuring, \"Ah!\nhow happy we should be there!\"\n\n\"Are we not happy?\" gently answered the young man passing his hands over\nher hair.\n\n\"Yes, that is true,\" she said. \"I am mad. Kiss me!\"\n\nTo her husband she was more charming than ever. She made him\npistachio-creams, and played him waltzes after dinner. So he thought\nhimself the most fortunate of men and Emma was without uneasiness, when,\none evening suddenly he said--\n\n\"It is Mademoiselle Lempereur, isn't it, who gives you lessons?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, I saw her just now,\" Charles went on, \"at Madame Liegeard's. I\nspoke to her about you, and she doesn't know you.\"\n\nThis was like a thunderclap. However, she replied quite naturally--\n\n\"Ah! no doubt she forgot my name.\"\n\n\"But perhaps,\" said the doctor, \"there are several Demoiselles Lempereur\nat Rouen who are music-mistresses.\"\n\n\"Possibly!\" Then quickly--\"But I have my receipts here. See!\"\n\nAnd she went to the writing-table, ransacked all the drawers, rummaged\nthe papers, and at last lost her head so completely that Charles\nearnestly begged her not to take so much trouble about those wretched\nreceipts.\n\n\"Oh, I will find them,\" she said.\n\nAnd, in fact, on the following Friday, as Charles was putting on one\nof his boots in the dark cabinet where his clothes were kept, he felt\na piece of paper between the leather and his sock. He took it out and\nread--\n\n\"Received, for three months' lessons and several pieces of music, the\nsum of sixty-three francs.--Felicie Lempereur, professor of music.\"\n\n\"How the devil did it get into my boots?\"\n\n\"It must,\" she replied, \"have fallen from the old box of bills that is\non the edge of the shelf.\"\n\nFrom that moment her existence was but one long tissue of lies, in which\nshe enveloped her love as in veils to hide it. It was a want, a mania,\na pleasure carried to such an extent that if she said she had the day\nbefore walked on the right side of a road, one might know she had taken\nthe left.\n\nOne morning, when she had gone, as usual, rather lightly clothed, it\nsuddenly began to snow, and as Charles was watching the weather from the\nwindow, he caught sight of Monsieur Bournisien in the chaise of Monsieur\nTuvache, who was driving him to Rouen. Then he went down to give the\npriest a thick shawl that he was to hand over to Emma as soon as he\nreached the \"Croix-Rouge.\" When he got to the inn, Monsieur Bournisien\nasked for the wife of the Yonville doctor. The landlady replied that\nshe very rarely came to her establishment. So that evening, when he\nrecognised Madame Bovary in the \"Hirondelle,\" the cure told her his\ndilemma, without, however, appearing to attach much importance to it,\nfor he began praising a preacher who was doing wonders at the Cathedral,\nand whom all the ladies were rushing to hear.\n\nStill, if he did not ask for any explanation, others, later on, might\nprove less discreet. So she thought well to get down each time at the\n\"Croix-Rouge,\" so that the good folk of her village who saw her on the\nstairs should suspect nothing.\n\nOne day, however, Monsieur Lheureux met her coming out of the Hotel\nde Boulogne on Leon's arm; and she was frightened, thinking he would\ngossip. He was not such a fool. But three days after he came to her\nroom, shut the door, and said, \"I must have some money.\"\n\nShe declared she could not give him any. Lheureux burst into\nlamentations and reminded her of all the kindnesses he had shown her.\n\nIn fact, of the two bills signed by Charles, Emma up to the present had\npaid only one. As to the second, the shopkeeper, at her request, had\nconsented to replace it by another, which again had been renewed for a\nlong date. Then he drew from his pocket a list of goods not paid for; to\nwit, the curtains, the carpet, the material for the armchairs, several\ndresses, and divers articles of dress, the bills for which amounted to\nabout two thousand francs.\n\nShe bowed her head. He went on--\n\n\"But if you haven't any ready money, you have an estate.\" And he\nreminded her of a miserable little hovel situated at Barneville, near\nAumale, that brought in almost nothing. It had formerly been part of a\nsmall farm sold by Monsieur Bovary senior; for Lheureux knew everything,\neven to the number of acres and the names of the neighbours.\n\n\"If I were in your place,\" he said, \"I should clear myself of my debts,\nand have money left over.\"\n\nShe pointed out the difficulty of getting a purchaser. He held out the\nhope of finding one; but she asked him how she should manage to sell it.\n\n\"Haven't you your power of attorney?\" he replied.\n\nThe phrase came to her like a breath of fresh air. \"Leave me the bill,\"\nsaid Emma.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't worth while,\" answered Lheureux.\n\nHe came back the following week and boasted of having, after much\ntrouble, at last discovered a certain Langlois, who, for a long time,\nhad had an eye on the property, but without mentioning his price.\n\n\"Never mind the price!\" she cried.\n\nBut they would, on the contrary, have to wait, to sound the fellow.\nThe thing was worth a journey, and, as she could not undertake it, he\noffered to go to the place to have an interview with Langlois. On his\nreturn he announced that the purchaser proposed four thousand francs.\n\nEmma was radiant at this news.\n\n\"Frankly,\" he added, \"that's a good price.\"\n\nShe drew half the sum at once, and when she was about to pay her account\nthe shopkeeper said--\n\n\"It really grieves me, on my word! to see you depriving yourself all at\nonce of such a big sum as that.\"\n\nThen she looked at the bank-notes, and dreaming of the unlimited number\nof rendezvous represented by those two thousand francs, she stammered--\n\n\"What! what!\"\n\n\"Oh!\" he went on, laughing good-naturedly, \"one puts anything one likes\non receipts. Don't you think I know what household affairs are?\" And he\nlooked at her fixedly, while in his hand he held two long papers that he\nslid between his nails. At last, opening his pocket-book, he spread out\non the table four bills to order, each for a thousand francs.\n\n\"Sign these,\" he said, \"and keep it all!\"\n\nShe cried out, scandalised.\n\n\"But if I give you the surplus,\" replied Monsieur Lheureux impudently,\n\"is that not helping you?\"\n\nAnd taking a pen he wrote at the bottom of the account, \"Received of\nMadame Bovary four thousand francs.\"\n\n\"Now who can trouble you, since in six months you'll draw the arrears\nfor your cottage, and I don't make the last bill due till after you've\nbeen paid?\"\n\nEmma grew rather confused in her calculations, and her ears tingled\nas if gold pieces, bursting from their bags, rang all round her on\nthe floor. At last Lheureux explained that he had a very good friend,\nVincart, a broker at Rouen, who would discount these four bills. Then\nhe himself would hand over to madame the remainder after the actual debt\nwas paid.\n\nBut instead of two thousand francs he brought only eighteen hundred, for\nthe friend Vincart (which was only fair) had deducted two hundred francs\nfor commission and discount. Then he carelessly asked for a receipt.\n\n\"You understand--in business--sometimes. And with the date, if you\nplease, with the date.\"\n\nA horizon of realisable whims opened out before Emma. She was prudent\nenough to lay by a thousand crowns, with which the first three bills\nwere paid when they fell due; but the fourth, by chance, came to the\nhouse on a Thursday, and Charles, quite upset, patiently awaited his\nwife's return for an explanation.\n\nIf she had not told him about this bill, it was only to spare him such\ndomestic worries; she sat on his knees, caressed him, cooed to him, gave\nhim a long enumeration of all the indispensable things that had been got\non credit.\n\n\"Really, you must confess, considering the quantity, it isn't too dear.\"\n\nCharles, at his wit's end, soon had recourse to the eternal Lheureux,\nwho swore he would arrange matters if the doctor would sign him two\nbills, one of which was for seven hundred francs, payable in three\nmonths. In order to arrange for this he wrote his mother a pathetic\nletter. Instead of sending a reply she came herself; and when Emma\nwanted to know whether he had got anything out of her, \"Yes,\" he\nreplied; \"but she wants to see the account.\" The next morning at\ndaybreak Emma ran to Lheureux to beg him to make out another account for\nnot more than a thousand francs, for to show the one for four thousand\nit would be necessary to say that she had paid two-thirds, and confess,\nconsequently, the sale of the estate--a negotiation admirably carried\nout by the shopkeeper, and which, in fact, was only actually known later\non.\n\nDespite the low price of each article, Madame Bovary senior, of course,\nthought the expenditure extravagant.\n\n\"Couldn't you do without a carpet? Why have recovered the arm-chairs? In\nmy time there was a single arm-chair in a house, for elderly persons--at\nany rate it was so at my mother's, who was a good woman, I can tell you.\nEverybody can't be rich! No fortune can hold out against waste! I should\nbe ashamed to coddle myself as you do! And yet I am old. I need looking\nafter. And there! there! fitting up gowns! fallals! What! silk for\nlining at two francs, when you can get jaconet for ten sous, or even for\neight, that would do well enough!\"\n\nEmma, lying on a lounge, replied as quietly as possible--\"Ah! Madame,\nenough! enough!\"\n\nThe other went on lecturing her, predicting they would end in the\nworkhouse. But it was Bovary's fault. Luckily he had promised to destroy\nthat power of attorney.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Ah! he swore he would,\" went on the good woman.\n\nEmma opened the window, called Charles, and the poor fellow was obliged\nto confess the promise torn from him by his mother.\n\nEmma disappeared, then came back quickly, and majestically handed her a\nthick piece of paper.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the old woman. And she threw the power of attorney\ninto the fire.\n\nEmma began to laugh, a strident, piercing, continuous laugh; she had an\nattack of hysterics.\n\n\"Oh, my God!\" cried Charles. \"Ah! you really are wrong! You come here\nand make scenes with her!\"\n\nHis mother, shrugging her shoulders, declared it was \"all put on.\"\n\nBut Charles, rebelling for the first time, took his wife's part, so that\nMadame Bovary, senior, said she would leave. She went the very next day,\nand on the threshold, as he was trying to detain her, she replied--\n\n\"No, no! You love her better than me, and you are right. It is natural.\nFor the rest, so much the worse! You will see. Good day--for I am not\nlikely to come soon again, as you say, to make scenes.\"\n\nCharles nevertheless was very crestfallen before Emma, who did not hide\nthe resentment she still felt at his want of confidence, and it needed\nmany prayers before she would consent to have another power of attorney.\nHe even accompanied her to Monsieur Guillaumin to have a second one,\njust like the other, drawn up.\n\n\"I understand,\" said the notary; \"a man of science can't be worried with\nthe practical details of life.\"\n\nAnd Charles felt relieved by this comfortable reflection, which gave his\nweakness the flattering appearance of higher pre-occupation.\n\nAnd what an outburst the next Thursday at the hotel in their room with\nLeon! She laughed, cried, sang, sent for sherbets, wanted to smoke\ncigarettes, seemed to him wild and extravagant, but adorable, superb.\n\nHe did not know what recreation of her whole being drove her more and\nmore to plunge into the pleasures of life. She was becoming irritable,\ngreedy, voluptuous; and she walked about the streets with him carrying\nher head high, without fear, so she said, of compromising herself.\nAt times, however, Emma shuddered at the sudden thought of meeting\nRodolphe, for it seemed to her that, although they were separated\nforever, she was not completely free from her subjugation to him.\n\nOne night she did not return to Yonville at all. Charles lost his head\nwith anxiety, and little Berthe would not go to bed without her mamma,\nand sobbed enough to break her heart. Justin had gone out searching the\nroad at random. Monsieur Homais even had left his pharmacy.\n\nAt last, at eleven o'clock, able to bear it no longer, Charles\nharnessed his chaise, jumped in, whipped up his horse, and reached the\n\"Croix-Rouge\" about two o'clock in the morning. No one there! He thought\nthat the clerk had perhaps seen her; but where did he live? Happily,\nCharles remembered his employer's address, and rushed off there.\n\nDay was breaking, and he could distinguish the escutcheons over the\ndoor, and knocked. Someone, without opening the door, shouted out the\nrequired information, adding a few insults to those who disturb people\nin the middle of the night.\n\nThe house inhabited by the clerk had neither bell, knocker, nor porter.\nCharles knocked loudly at the shutters with his hands. A policeman\nhappened to pass by. Then he was frightened, and went away.\n\n\"I am mad,\" he said; \"no doubt they kept her to dinner at Monsieur\nLormeaux'.\" But the Lormeaux no longer lived at Rouen.\n\n\"She probably stayed to look after Madame Dubreuil. Why, Madame Dubreuil\nhas been dead these ten months! Where can she be?\"\n\nAn idea occurred to him. At a cafe he asked for a Directory, and\nhurriedly looked for the name of Mademoiselle Lempereur, who lived at\nNo. 74 Rue de la Renelle-des-Maroquiniers.\n\nAs he was turning into the street, Emma herself appeared at the other\nend of it. He threw himself upon her rather than embraced her, crying--\n\n\"What kept you yesterday?\"\n\n\"I was not well.\"\n\n\"What was it? Where? How?\"\n\nShe passed her hand over her forehead and answered, \"At Mademoiselle\nLempereur's.\"\n\n\"I was sure of it! I was going there.\"\n\n\"Oh, it isn't worth while,\" said Emma. \"She went out just now; but for\nthe future don't worry. I do not feel free, you see, if I know that the\nleast delay upsets you like this.\"\n\nThis was a sort of permission that she gave herself, so as to get\nperfect freedom in her escapades. And she profited by it freely, fully.\nWhen she was seized with the desire to see Leon, she set out upon any\npretext; and as he was not expecting her on that day, she went to fetch\nhim at his office.\n\nIt was a great delight at first, but soon he no longer concealed the\ntruth, which was, that his master complained very much about these\ninterruptions.\n\n\"Pshaw! come along,\" she said.\n\nAnd he slipped out.\n\nShe wanted him to dress all in black, and grow a pointed beard, to\nlook like the portraits of Louis XIII. She wanted to see his lodgings;\nthought them poor. He blushed at them, but she did not notice this, then\nadvised him to buy some curtains like hers, and as he objected to the\nexpense--\n\n\"Ah! ah! you care for your money,\" she said laughing.\n\nEach time Leon had to tell her everything that he had done since their\nlast meeting. She asked him for some verses--some verses \"for herself,\"\na \"love poem\" in honour of her. But he never succeeded in getting a\nrhyme for the second verse; and at last ended by copying a sonnet in\na \"Keepsake.\" This was less from vanity than from the one desire of\npleasing her. He did not question her ideas; he accepted all her tastes;\nhe was rather becoming her mistress than she his. She had tender words\nand kisses that thrilled his soul. Where could she have learnt this\ncorruption almost incorporeal in the strength of its profanity and\ndissimulation?\n\n\n\nChapter Six\n\nDuring the journeys he made to see her, Leon had often dined at the\nchemist's, and he felt obliged from politeness to invite him in turn.\n\n\"With pleasure!\" Monsieur Homais replied; \"besides, I must invigorate\nmy mind, for I am getting rusty here. We'll go to the theatre, to the\nrestaurant; we'll make a night of it.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear!\" tenderly murmured Madame Homais, alarmed at the vague\nperils he was preparing to brave.\n\n\"Well, what? Do you think I'm not sufficiently ruining my health living\nhere amid the continual emanations of the pharmacy? But there! that is\nthe way with women! They are jealous of science, and then are opposed to\nour taking the most legitimate distractions. No matter! Count upon\nme. One of these days I shall turn up at Rouen, and we'll go the pace\ntogether.\"\n\nThe druggist would formerly have taken good care not to use such an\nexpression, but he was cultivating a gay Parisian style, which he\nthought in the best taste; and, like his neighbour, Madame Bovary, he\nquestioned the clerk curiously about the customs of the capital; he\neven talked slang to dazzle the bourgeois, saying bender, crummy, dandy,\nmacaroni, the cheese, cut my stick and \"I'll hook it,\" for \"I am going.\"\n\nSo one Thursday Emma was surprised to meet Monsieur Homais in the\nkitchen of the \"Lion d'Or,\" wearing a traveller's costume, that is to\nsay, wrapped in an old cloak which no one knew he had, while he carried\na valise in one hand and the foot-warmer of his establishment in the\nother. He had confided his intentions to no one, for fear of causing the\npublic anxiety by his absence.\n\nThe idea of seeing again the place where his youth had been spent no\ndoubt excited him, for during the whole journey he never ceased talking,\nand as soon as he had arrived, he jumped quickly out of the diligence\nto go in search of Leon. In vain the clerk tried to get rid of him.\nMonsieur Homais dragged him off to the large Cafe de la Normandie,\nwhich he entered majestically, not raising his hat, thinking it very\nprovincial to uncover in any public place.\n\nEmma waited for Leon three quarters of an hour. At last she ran to\nhis office; and, lost in all sorts of conjectures, accusing him of\nindifference, and reproaching herself for her weakness, she spent the\nafternoon, her face pressed against the window-panes.\n\nAt two o'clock they were still at a table opposite each other. The large\nroom was emptying; the stove-pipe, in the shape of a palm-tree, spread\nits gilt leaves over the white ceiling, and near them, outside the\nwindow, in the bright sunshine, a little fountain gurgled in a white\nbasin, where; in the midst of watercress and asparagus, three torpid\nlobsters stretched across to some quails that lay heaped up in a pile on\ntheir sides.\n\nHomais was enjoying himself. Although he was even more intoxicated with\nthe luxury than the rich fare, the Pommard wine all the same rather\nexcited his faculties; and when the omelette au rhum* appeared, he began\npropounding immoral theories about women. What seduced him above all\nelse was chic. He admired an elegant toilette in a well-furnished\napartment, and as to bodily qualities, he didn't dislike a young girl.\n\n     * In rum.\n\n\nLeon watched the clock in despair. The druggist went on drinking,\neating, and talking.\n\n\"You must be very lonely,\" he said suddenly, \"here at Rouen. To be sure\nyour lady-love doesn't live far away.\"\n\nAnd the other blushed--\n\n\"Come now, be frank. Can you deny that at Yonville--\"\n\nThe young man stammered something.\n\n\"At Madame Bovary's, you're not making love to--\"\n\n\"To whom?\"\n\n\"The servant!\"\n\nHe was not joking; but vanity getting the better of all prudence, Leon,\nin spite of himself protested. Besides, he only liked dark women.\n\n\"I approve of that,\" said the chemist; \"they have more passion.\"\n\nAnd whispering into his friend's ear, he pointed out the symptoms by\nwhich one could find out if a woman had passion. He even launched into\nan ethnographic digression: the German was vapourish, the French woman\nlicentious, the Italian passionate.\n\n\"And negresses?\" asked the clerk.\n\n\"They are an artistic taste!\" said Homais. \"Waiter! two cups of coffee!\"\n\n\"Are we going?\" at last asked Leon impatiently.\n\n\"Ja!\"\n\nBut before leaving he wanted to see the proprietor of the establishment\nand made him a few compliments. Then the young man, to be alone, alleged\nhe had some business engagement.\n\n\"Ah! I will escort you,\" said Homais.\n\nAnd all the while he was walking through the streets with him he talked\nof his wife, his children; of their future, and of his business; told\nhim in what a decayed condition it had formerly been, and to what a\ndegree of perfection he had raised it.\n\nArrived in front of the Hotel de Boulogne, Leon left him abruptly, ran\nup the stairs, and found his mistress in great excitement. At mention of\nthe chemist she flew into a passion. He, however, piled up good reasons;\nit wasn't his fault; didn't she know Homais--did she believe that he\nwould prefer his company? But she turned away; he drew her back, and,\nsinking on his knees, clasped her waist with his arms in a languorous\npose, full of concupiscence and supplication.\n\nShe was standing up, her large flashing eyes looked at him seriously,\nalmost terribly. Then tears obscured them, her red eyelids were lowered,\nshe gave him her hands, and Leon was pressing them to his lips when a\nservant appeared to tell the gentleman that he was wanted.\n\n\"You will come back?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But when?\"\n\n\"Immediately.\"\n\n\"It's a trick,\" said the chemist, when he saw Leon. \"I wanted to\ninterrupt this visit, that seemed to me to annoy you. Let's go and have\na glass of garus at Bridoux'.\"\n\nLeon vowed that he must get back to his office. Then the druggist joked\nhim about quill-drivers and the law.\n\n\"Leave Cujas and Barthole alone a bit. Who the devil prevents you? Be a\nman! Let's go to Bridoux'. You'll see his dog. It's very interesting.\"\n\nAnd as the clerk still insisted--\n\n\"I'll go with you. I'll read a paper while I wait for you, or turn over\nthe leaves of a 'Code.'\"\n\nLeon, bewildered by Emma's anger, Monsieur Homais' chatter, and,\nperhaps, by the heaviness of the luncheon, was undecided, and, as it\nwere, fascinated by the chemist, who kept repeating--\n\n\"Let's go to Bridoux'. It's just by here, in the Rue Malpalu.\"\n\nThen, through cowardice, through stupidity, through that indefinable\nfeeling that drags us into the most distasteful acts, he allowed\nhimself to be led off to Bridoux', whom they found in his small yard,\nsuperintending three workmen, who panted as they turned the large\nwheel of a machine for making seltzer-water. Homais gave them some good\nadvice. He embraced Bridoux; they took some garus. Twenty times Leon\ntried to escape, but the other seized him by the arm saying--\n\n\"Presently! I'm coming! We'll go to the 'Fanal de Rouen' to see the\nfellows there. I'll introduce you to Thornassin.\"\n\nAt last he managed to get rid of him, and rushed straight to the hotel.\nEmma was no longer there. She had just gone in a fit of anger. She\ndetested him now. This failing to keep their rendezvous seemed to her an\ninsult, and she tried to rake up other reasons to separate herself from\nhim. He was incapable of heroism, weak, banal, more spiritless than a\nwoman, avaricious too, and cowardly.\n\nThen, growing calmer, she at length discovered that she had, no doubt,\ncalumniated him. But the disparaging of those we love always alienates\nus from them to some extent. We must not touch our idols; the gilt\nsticks to our fingers.\n\nThey gradually came to talking more frequently of matters outside their\nlove, and in the letters that Emma wrote him she spoke of flowers,\nverses, the moon and the stars, naive resources of a waning passion\nstriving to keep itself alive by all external aids. She was constantly\npromising herself a profound felicity on her next journey. Then\nshe confessed to herself that she felt nothing extraordinary. This\ndisappointment quickly gave way to a new hope, and Emma returned to him\nmore inflamed, more eager than ever. She undressed brutally, tearing off\nthe thin laces of her corset that nestled around her hips like a gliding\nsnake. She went on tiptoe, barefooted, to see once more that the\ndoor was closed, then, pale, serious, and, without speaking, with one\nmovement, she threw herself upon his breast with a long shudder.\n\nYet there was upon that brow covered with cold drops, on those quivering\nlips, in those wild eyes, in the strain of those arms, something vague\nand dreary that seemed to Leon to glide between them subtly as if to\nseparate them.\n\nHe did not dare to question her; but, seeing her so skilled, she must\nhave passed, he thought, through every experience of suffering and of\npleasure. What had once charmed now frightened him a little. Besides, he\nrebelled against his absorption, daily more marked, by her personality.\nHe begrudged Emma this constant victory. He even strove not to love her;\nthen, when he heard the creaking of her boots, he turned coward, like\ndrunkards at the sight of strong drinks.\n\nShe did not fail, in truth, to lavish all sorts of attentions upon him,\nfrom the delicacies of food to the coquettries of dress and languishing\nlooks. She brought roses to her breast from Yonville, which she threw\ninto his face; was anxious about his health, gave him advice as to his\nconduct; and, in order the more surely to keep her hold on him, hoping\nperhaps that heaven would take her part, she tied a medal of the\nVirgin round his neck. She inquired like a virtuous mother about his\ncompanions. She said to him--\n\n\"Don't see them; don't go out; think only of ourselves; love me!\"\n\nShe would have liked to be able to watch over his life; and the idea\noccurred to her of having him followed in the streets. Near the hotel\nthere was always a kind of loafer who accosted travellers, and who would\nnot refuse. But her pride revolted at this.\n\n\"Bah! so much the worse. Let him deceive me! What does it matter to me?\nAs If I cared for him!\"\n\nOne day, when they had parted early and she was returning alone along\nthe boulevard, she saw the walls of her convent; then she sat down on a\nform in the shade of the elm-trees. How calm that time had been! How she\nlonged for the ineffable sentiments of love that she had tried to figure\nto herself out of books! The first month of her marriage, her rides in\nthe wood, the viscount that waltzed, and Lagardy singing, all repassed\nbefore her eyes. And Leon suddenly appeared to her as far off as the\nothers.\n\n\"Yet I love him,\" she said to herself.\n\nNo matter! She was not happy--she never had been. Whence came this\ninsufficiency in life--this instantaneous turning to decay of everything\non which she leant? But if there were somewhere a being strong and\nbeautiful, a valiant nature, full at once of exaltation and refinement,\na poet's heart in an angel's form, a lyre with sounding chords ringing\nout elegiac epithalamia to heaven, why, perchance, should she not find\nhim? Ah! how impossible! Besides, nothing was worth the trouble of\nseeking it; everything was a lie. Every smile hid a yawn of boredom,\nevery joy a curse, all pleasure satiety, and the sweetest kisses left\nupon your lips only the unattainable desire for a greater delight.\n\nA metallic clang droned through the air, and four strokes were heard\nfrom the convent-clock. Four o'clock! And it seemed to her that she had\nbeen there on that form an eternity. But an infinity of passions may be\ncontained in a minute, like a crowd in a small space.\n\nEmma lived all absorbed in hers, and troubled no more about money\nmatters than an archduchess.\n\nOnce, however, a wretched-looking man, rubicund and bald, came to her\nhouse, saying he had been sent by Monsieur Vincart of Rouen. He took out\nthe pins that held together the side-pockets of his long green overcoat,\nstuck them into his sleeve, and politely handed her a paper.\n\nIt was a bill for seven hundred francs, signed by her, and which\nLheureux, in spite of all his professions, had paid away to Vincart. She\nsent her servant for him. He could not come. Then the stranger, who\nhad remained standing, casting right and left curious glances, that his\nthick, fair eyebrows hid, asked with a naive air--\n\n\"What answer am I to take Monsieur Vincart?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Emma, \"tell him that I haven't it. I will send next week; he\nmust wait; yes, till next week.\"\n\nAnd the fellow went without another word.\n\nBut the next day at twelve o'clock she received a summons, and the sight\nof the stamped paper, on which appeared several times in large letters,\n\"Maitre Hareng, bailiff at Buchy,\" so frightened her that she rushed in\nhot haste to the linendraper's. She found him in his shop, doing up a\nparcel.\n\n\"Your obedient!\" he said; \"I am at your service.\"\n\nBut Lheureux, all the same, went on with his work, helped by a young\ngirl of about thirteen, somewhat hunch-backed, who was at once his clerk\nand his servant.\n\nThen, his clogs clattering on the shop-boards, he went up in front\nof Madame Bovary to the first door, and introduced her into a narrow\ncloset, where, in a large bureau in sapon-wood, lay some ledgers,\nprotected by a horizontal padlocked iron bar. Against the wall, under\nsome remnants of calico, one glimpsed a safe, but of such dimensions\nthat it must contain something besides bills and money. Monsieur\nLheureux, in fact, went in for pawnbroking, and it was there that he had\nput Madame Bovary's gold chain, together with the earrings of poor old\nTellier, who, at last forced to sell out, had bought a meagre store\nof grocery at Quincampoix, where he was dying of catarrh amongst his\ncandles, that were less yellow than his face.\n\nLheureux sat down in a large cane arm-chair, saying: \"What news?\"\n\n\"See!\"\n\nAnd she showed him the paper.\n\n\"Well how can I help it?\"\n\nThen she grew angry, reminding him of the promise he had given not to\npay away her bills. He acknowledged it.\n\n\"But I was pressed myself; the knife was at my own throat.\"\n\n\"And what will happen now?\" she went on.\n\n\"Oh, it's very simple; a judgment and then a distraint--that's about\nit!\"\n\nEmma kept down a desire to strike him, and asked gently if there was no\nway of quieting Monsieur Vincart.\n\n\"I dare say! Quiet Vincart! You don't know him; he's more ferocious than\nan Arab!\"\n\nStill Monsieur Lheureux must interfere.\n\n\"Well, listen. It seems to me so far I've been very good to you.\" And\nopening one of his ledgers, \"See,\" he said. Then running up the page\nwith his finger, \"Let's see! let's see! August 3d, two hundred francs;\nJune 17th, a hundred and fifty; March 23d, forty-six. In April--\"\n\nHe stopped, as if afraid of making some mistake.\n\n\"Not to speak of the bills signed by Monsieur Bovary, one for seven\nhundred francs, and another for three hundred. As to your little\ninstallments, with the interest, why, there's no end to 'em; one gets\nquite muddled over 'em. I'll have nothing more to do with it.\"\n\nShe wept; she even called him \"her good Monsieur Lheureux.\" But he\nalways fell back upon \"that rascal Vincart.\" Besides, he hadn't a brass\nfarthing; no one was paying him now-a-days; they were eating his coat\noff his back; a poor shopkeeper like him couldn't advance money.\n\nEmma was silent, and Monsieur Lheureux, who was biting the feathers of a\nquill, no doubt became uneasy at her silence, for he went on--\n\n\"Unless one of these days I have something coming in, I might--\"\n\n\"Besides,\" said she, \"as soon as the balance of Barneville--\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\nAnd on hearing that Langlois had not yet paid he seemed much surprised.\nThen in a honied voice--\n\n\"And we agree, you say?\"\n\n\"Oh! to anything you like.\"\n\nOn this he closed his eyes to reflect, wrote down a few figures, and\ndeclaring it would be very difficult for him, that the affair was shady,\nand that he was being bled, he wrote out four bills for two hundred and\nfifty francs each, to fall due month by month.\n\n\"Provided that Vincart will listen to me! However, it's settled. I don't\nplay the fool; I'm straight enough.\"\n\nNext he carelessly showed her several new goods, not one of which,\nhowever, was in his opinion worthy of madame.\n\n\"When I think that there's a dress at threepence-halfpenny a yard, and\nwarranted fast colours! And yet they actually swallow it! Of course you\nunderstand one doesn't tell them what it really is!\" He hoped by this\nconfession of dishonesty to others to quite convince her of his probity\nto her.\n\nThen he called her back to show her three yards of guipure that he had\nlately picked up \"at a sale.\"\n\n\"Isn't it lovely?\" said Lheureux. \"It is very much used now for the\nbacks of arm-chairs. It's quite the rage.\"\n\nAnd, more ready than a juggler, he wrapped up the guipure in some blue\npaper and put it in Emma's hands.\n\n\"But at least let me know--\"\n\n\"Yes, another time,\" he replied, turning on his heel.\n\nThat same evening she urged Bovary to write to his mother, to ask her\nto send as quickly as possible the whole of the balance due from the\nfather's estate. The mother-in-law replied that she had nothing more,\nthe winding up was over, and there was due to them besides Barneville an\nincome of six hundred francs, that she would pay them punctually.\n\nThen Madame Bovary sent in accounts to two or three patients, and she\nmade large use of this method, which was very successful. She was always\ncareful to add a postscript: \"Do not mention this to my husband; you\nknow how proud he is. Excuse me. Yours obediently.\" There were some\ncomplaints; she intercepted them.\n\nTo get money she began selling her old gloves, her old hats, the old\nodds and ends, and she bargained rapaciously, her peasant blood standing\nher in good stead. Then on her journey to town she picked up nick-nacks\nsecondhand, that, in default of anyone else, Monsieur Lheureux would\ncertainly take off her hands. She bought ostrich feathers, Chinese\nporcelain, and trunks; she borrowed from Felicite, from Madame\nLefrancois, from the landlady at the Croix-Rouge, from everybody, no\nmatter where.\n\nWith the money she at last received from Barneville she paid two bills;\nthe other fifteen hundred francs fell due. She renewed the bills, and\nthus it was continually.\n\nSometimes, it is true, she tried to make a calculation, but she\ndiscovered things so exorbitant that she could not believe them\npossible. Then she recommenced, soon got confused, gave it all up, and\nthought no more about it.\n\nThe house was very dreary now. Tradesmen were seen leaving it with angry\nfaces. Handkerchiefs were lying about on the stoves, and little Berthe,\nto the great scandal of Madame Homais, wore stockings with holes in\nthem. If Charles timidly ventured a remark, she answered roughly that it\nwasn't her fault.\n\nWhat was the meaning of all these fits of temper? He explained\neverything through her old nervous illness, and reproaching himself with\nhaving taken her infirmities for faults, accused himself of egotism, and\nlonged to go and take her in his arms.\n\n\"Ah, no!\" he said to himself; \"I should worry her.\"\n\nAnd he did not stir.\n\nAfter dinner he walked about alone in the garden; he took little Berthe\non his knees, and unfolding his medical journal, tried to teach her\nto read. But the child, who never had any lessons, soon looked up with\nlarge, sad eyes and began to cry. Then he comforted her; went to fetch\nwater in her can to make rivers on the sand path, or broke off branches\nfrom the privet hedges to plant trees in the beds. This did not spoil\nthe garden much, all choked now with long weeds. They owed Lestiboudois\nfor so many days. Then the child grew cold and asked for her mother.\n\n\"Call the servant,\" said Charles. \"You know, dearie, that mamma does not\nlike to be disturbed.\"\n\nAutumn was setting in, and the leaves were already falling, as they did\ntwo years ago when she was ill. Where would it all end? And he walked up\nand down, his hands behind his back.\n\nMadame was in her room, which no one entered. She stayed there all\nday long, torpid, half dressed, and from time to time burning Turkish\npastilles which she had bought at Rouen in an Algerian's shop. In order\nnot to have at night this sleeping man stretched at her side, by dint of\nmanoeuvring, she at last succeeded in banishing him to the second floor,\nwhile she read till morning extravagant books, full of pictures of\norgies and thrilling situations. Often, seized with fear, she cried out,\nand Charles hurried to her.\n\n\"Oh, go away!\" she would say.\n\nOr at other times, consumed more ardently than ever by that inner flame\nto which adultery added fuel, panting, tremulous, all desire, she threw\nopen her window, breathed in the cold air, shook loose in the wind her\nmasses of hair, too heavy, and, gazing upon the stars, longed for some\nprincely love. She thought of him, of Leon. She would then have given\nanything for a single one of those meetings that surfeited her.\n\nThese were her gala days. She wanted them to be sumptuous, and when he\nalone could not pay the expenses, she made up the deficit liberally,\nwhich happened pretty well every time. He tried to make her understand\nthat they would be quite as comfortable somewhere else, in a smaller\nhotel, but she always found some objection.\n\nOne day she drew six small silver-gilt spoons from her bag (they were\nold Roualt's wedding present), begging him to pawn them at once for her,\nand Leon obeyed, though the proceeding annoyed him. He was afraid of\ncompromising himself.\n\nThen, on, reflection, he began to think his mistress's ways were growing\nodd, and that they were perhaps not wrong in wishing to separate him\nfrom her.\n\nIn fact someone had sent his mother a long anonymous letter to warn her\nthat he was \"ruining himself with a married woman,\" and the good lady at\nonce conjuring up the eternal bugbear of families, the vague pernicious\ncreature, the siren, the monster, who dwells fantastically in depths of\nlove, wrote to Lawyer Dubocage, his employer, who behaved perfectly in\nthe affair. He kept him for three quarters of an hour trying to open\nhis eyes, to warn him of the abyss into which he was falling. Such\nan intrigue would damage him later on, when he set up for himself. He\nimplored him to break with her, and, if he would not make this sacrifice\nin his own interest, to do it at least for his, Dubocage's sake.\n\nAt last Leon swore he would not see Emma again, and he reproached\nhimself with not having kept his word, considering all the worry and\nlectures this woman might still draw down upon him, without reckoning\nthe jokes made by his companions as they sat round the stove in the\nmorning. Besides, he was soon to be head clerk; it was time to settle\ndown. So he gave up his flute, exalted sentiments, and poetry; for every\nbourgeois in the flush of his youth, were it but for a day, a moment,\nhas believed himself capable of immense passions, of lofty enterprises.\nThe most mediocre libertine has dreamed of sultanas; every notary bears\nwithin him the debris of a poet.\n\nHe was bored now when Emma suddenly began to sob on his breast, and his\nheart, like the people who can only stand a certain amount of music,\ndozed to the sound of a love whose delicacies he no longer noted.\n\nThey knew one another too well for any of those surprises of possession\nthat increase its joys a hundred-fold. She was as sick of him as he\nwas weary of her. Emma found again in adultery all the platitudes of\nmarriage.\n\nBut how to get rid of him? Then, though she might feel humiliated at\nthe baseness of such enjoyment, she clung to it from habit or from\ncorruption, and each day she hungered after them the more, exhausting\nall felicity in wishing for too much of it. She accused Leon of her\nbaffled hopes, as if he had betrayed her; and she even longed for some\ncatastrophe that would bring about their separation, since she had not\nthe courage to make up her mind to it herself.\n\nShe none the less went on writing him love letters, in virtue of the\nnotion that a woman must write to her lover.\n\nBut whilst she wrote it was another man she saw, a phantom fashioned out\nof her most ardent memories, of her finest reading, her strongest\nlusts, and at last he became so real, so tangible, that she palpitated\nwondering, without, however, the power to imagine him clearly, so lost\nwas he, like a god, beneath the abundance of his attributes. He dwelt in\nthat azure land where silk ladders hang from balconies under the breath\nof flowers, in the light of the moon. She felt him near her; he was\ncoming, and would carry her right away in a kiss.\n\nThen she fell back exhausted, for these transports of vague love wearied\nher more than great debauchery.\n\nShe now felt constant ache all over her. Often she even received\nsummonses, stamped paper that she barely looked at. She would have liked\nnot to be alive, or to be always asleep.\n\nOn Mid-Lent she did not return to Yonville, but in the evening went to\na masked ball. She wore velvet breeches, red stockings, a club wig, and\nthree-cornered hat cocked on one side. She danced all night to the wild\ntones of the trombones; people gathered round her, and in the morning\nshe found herself on the steps of the theatre together with five or six\nmasks, debardeuses* and sailors, Leon's comrades, who were talking about\nhaving supper.\n\n     * People dressed as longshoremen.\n\n\nThe neighbouring cafes were full. They caught sight of one on the\nharbour, a very indifferent restaurant, whose proprietor showed them to\na little room on the fourth floor.\n\nThe men were whispering in a corner, no doubt consorting about expenses.\nThere were a clerk, two medical students, and a shopman--what company\nfor her! As to the women, Emma soon perceived from the tone of their\nvoices that they must almost belong to the lowest class. Then she was\nfrightened, pushed back her chair, and cast down her eyes.\n\nThe others began to eat; she ate nothing. Her head was on fire, her eyes\nsmarted, and her skin was ice-cold. In her head she seemed to feel the\nfloor of the ball-room rebounding again beneath the rhythmical pulsation\nof the thousands of dancing feet. And now the smell of the punch, the\nsmoke of the cigars, made her giddy. She fainted, and they carried her\nto the window.\n\nDay was breaking, and a great stain of purple colour broadened out\nin the pale horizon over the St. Catherine hills. The livid river was\nshivering in the wind; there was no one on the bridges; the street lamps\nwere going out.\n\nShe revived, and began thinking of Berthe asleep yonder in the servant's\nroom. Then a cart filled with long strips of iron passed by, and made a\ndeafening metallic vibration against the walls of the houses.\n\nShe slipped away suddenly, threw off her costume, told Leon she must get\nback, and at last was alone at the Hotel de Boulogne. Everything, even\nherself, was now unbearable to her. She wished that, taking wing like a\nbird, she could fly somewhere, far away to regions of purity, and there\ngrow young again.\n\nShe went out, crossed the Boulevard, the Place Cauchoise, and the\nFaubourg, as far as an open street that overlooked some gardens. She\nwalked rapidly; the fresh air calming her; and, little by little, the\nfaces of the crowd, the masks, the quadrilles, the lights, the supper,\nthose women, all disappeared like mists fading away. Then, reaching the\n\"Croix-Rouge,\" she threw herself on the bed in her little room on the\nsecond floor, where there were pictures of the \"Tour de Nesle.\" At four\no'clock Hivert awoke her.\n\nWhen she got home, Felicite showed her behind the clock a grey paper.\nShe read--\n\n\"In virtue of the seizure in execution of a judgment.\"\n\nWhat judgment? As a matter of fact, the evening before another paper\nhad been brought that she had not yet seen, and she was stunned by these\nwords--\n\n\"By order of the king, law, and justice, to Madame Bovary.\" Then,\nskipping several lines, she read, \"Within twenty-four hours, without\nfail--\" But what? \"To pay the sum of eight thousand francs.\" And there\nwas even at the bottom, \"She will be constrained thereto by every\nform of law, and notably by a writ of distraint on her furniture and\neffects.\"\n\nWhat was to be done? In twenty-four hours--tomorrow. Lheureux, she\nthought, wanted to frighten her again; for she saw through all his\ndevices, the object of his kindnesses. What reassured her was the very\nmagnitude of the sum.\n\nHowever, by dint of buying and not paying, of borrowing, signing bills,\nand renewing these bills that grew at each new falling-in, she had ended\nby preparing a capital for Monsieur Lheureux which he was impatiently\nawaiting for his speculations.\n\nShe presented herself at his place with an offhand air.\n\n\"You know what has happened to me? No doubt it's a joke!\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\nHe turned away slowly, and, folding his arms, said to her--\n\n\"My good lady, did you think I should go on to all eternity being your\npurveyor and banker, for the love of God? Now be just. I must get back\nwhat I've laid out. Now be just.\"\n\nShe cried out against the debt.\n\n\"Ah! so much the worse. The court has admitted it. There's a judgment.\nIt's been notified to you. Besides, it isn't my fault. It's Vincart's.\"\n\n\"Could you not--?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing whatever.\"\n\n\"But still, now talk it over.\"\n\nAnd she began beating about the bush; she had known nothing about it; it\nwas a surprise.\n\n\"Whose fault is that?\" said Lheureux, bowing ironically. \"While I'm\nslaving like a nigger, you go gallivanting about.\"\n\n\"Ah! no lecturing.\"\n\n\"It never does any harm,\" he replied.\n\nShe turned coward; she implored him; she even pressed her pretty white\nand slender hand against the shopkeeper's knee.\n\n\"There, that'll do! Anyone'd think you wanted to seduce me!\"\n\n\"You are a wretch!\" she cried.\n\n\"Oh, oh! go it! go it!\"\n\n\"I will show you up. I shall tell my husband.\"\n\n\"All right! I too. I'll show your husband something.\"\n\nAnd Lheureux drew from his strong box the receipt for eighteen hundred\nfrancs that she had given him when Vincart had discounted the bills.\n\n\"Do you think,\" he added, \"that he'll not understand your little theft,\nthe poor dear man?\"\n\nShe collapsed, more overcome than if felled by the blow of a pole-axe.\nHe was walking up and down from the window to the bureau, repeating all\nthe while--\n\n\"Ah! I'll show him! I'll show him!\" Then he approached her, and in a\nsoft voice said--\n\n\"It isn't pleasant, I know; but, after all, no bones are broken, and,\nsince that is the only way that is left for you paying back my money--\"\n\n\"But where am I to get any?\" said Emma, wringing her hands.\n\n\"Bah! when one has friends like you!\"\n\nAnd he looked at her in so keen, so terrible a fashion, that she\nshuddered to her very heart.\n\n\"I promise you,\" she said, \"to sign--\"\n\n\"I've enough of your signatures.\"\n\n\"I will sell something.\"\n\n\"Get along!\" he said, shrugging his shoulders; \"you've not got\nanything.\"\n\nAnd he called through the peep-hole that looked down into the shop--\n\n\"Annette, don't forget the three coupons of No. 14.\"\n\nThe servant appeared. Emma understood, and asked how much money would be\nwanted to put a stop to the proceedings.\n\n\"It is too late.\"\n\n\"But if I brought you several thousand francs--a quarter of the sum--a\nthird--perhaps the whole?\"\n\n\"No; it's no use!\"\n\nAnd he pushed her gently towards the staircase.\n\n\"I implore you, Monsieur Lheureux, just a few days more!\" She was\nsobbing.\n\n\"There! tears now!\"\n\n\"You are driving me to despair!\"\n\n\"What do I care?\" said he, shutting the door.\n\n\n\nChapter Seven\n\nShe was stoical the next day when Maitre Hareng, the bailiff, with two\nassistants, presented himself at her house to draw up the inventory for\nthe distraint.\n\nThey began with Bovary's consulting-room, and did not write down\nthe phrenological head, which was considered an \"instrument of his\nprofession\"; but in the kitchen they counted the plates; the saucepans,\nthe chairs, the candlesticks, and in the bedroom all the nick-nacks on\nthe whatnot. They examined her dresses, the linen, the dressing-room;\nand her whole existence to its most intimate details, was, like a corpse\non whom a post-mortem is made, outspread before the eyes of these three\nmen.\n\nMaitre Hareng, buttoned up in his thin black coat, wearing a white\nchoker and very tight foot-straps, repeated from time to time--\"Allow\nme, madame. You allow me?\" Often he uttered exclamations. \"Charming!\nvery pretty.\" Then he began writing again, dipping his pen into the horn\ninkstand in his left hand.\n\nWhen they had done with the rooms they went up to the attic. She kept a\ndesk there in which Rodolphe's letters were locked. It had to be opened.\n\n\"Ah! a correspondence,\" said Maitre Hareng, with a discreet smile. \"But\nallow me, for I must make sure the box contains nothing else.\" And he\ntipped up the papers lightly, as if to shake out napoleons. Then she\ngrew angered to see this coarse hand, with fingers red and pulpy like\nslugs, touching these pages against which her heart had beaten.\n\nThey went at last. Felicite came back. Emma had sent her out to watch\nfor Bovary in order to keep him off, and they hurriedly installed the\nman in possession under the roof, where he swore he would remain.\n\nDuring the evening Charles seemed to her careworn. Emma watched him with\na look of anguish, fancying she saw an accusation in every line of his\nface. Then, when her eyes wandered over the chimney-piece ornamented\nwith Chinese screens, over the large curtains, the armchairs, all\nthose things, in a word, that had, softened the bitterness of her life,\nremorse seized her or rather an immense regret, that, far from crushing,\nirritated her passion. Charles placidly poked the fire, both his feet on\nthe fire-dogs.\n\nOnce the man, no doubt bored in his hiding-place, made a slight noise.\n\n\"Is anyone walking upstairs?\" said Charles.\n\n\"No,\" she replied; \"it is a window that has been left open, and is\nrattling in the wind.\"\n\nThe next day, Sunday, she went to Rouen to call on all the brokers whose\nnames she knew. They were at their country-places or on journeys. She\nwas not discouraged; and those whom she did manage to see she asked for\nmoney, declaring she must have some, and that she would pay it back.\nSome laughed in her face; all refused.\n\nAt two o'clock she hurried to Leon, and knocked at the door. No one\nanswered. At length he appeared.\n\n\"What brings you here?\"\n\n\"Do I disturb you?\"\n\n\"No; but--\" And he admitted that his landlord didn't like his having\n\"women\" there.\n\n\"I must speak to you,\" she went on.\n\nThen he took down the key, but she stopped him.\n\n\"No, no! Down there, in our home!\"\n\nAnd they went to their room at the Hotel de Boulogne.\n\nOn arriving she drank off a large glass of water. She was very pale. She\nsaid to him--\n\n\"Leon, you will do me a service?\"\n\nAnd, shaking him by both hands that she grasped tightly, she added--\n\n\"Listen, I want eight thousand francs.\"\n\n\"But you are mad!\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nAnd thereupon, telling him the story of the distraint, she explained\nher distress to him; for Charles knew nothing of it; her mother-in-law\ndetested her; old Rouault could do nothing; but he, Leon, he would set\nabout finding this indispensable sum.\n\n\"How on earth can I?\"\n\n\"What a coward you are!\" she cried.\n\nThen he said stupidly, \"You are exaggerating the difficulty. Perhaps,\nwith a thousand crowns or so the fellow could be stopped.\"\n\nAll the greater reason to try and do something; it was impossible that\nthey could not find three thousand francs. Besides, Leon, could be\nsecurity instead of her.\n\n\"Go, try, try! I will love you so!\"\n\nHe went out, and came back at the end of an hour, saying, with solemn\nface--\n\n\"I have been to three people with no success.\"\n\nThen they remained sitting face to face at the two chimney corners,\nmotionless, in silence. Emma shrugged her shoulders as she stamped her\nfeet. He heard her murmuring--\n\n\"If I were in your place _I_ should soon get some.\"\n\n\"But where?\"\n\n\"At your office.\" And she looked at him.\n\nAn infernal boldness looked out from her burning eyes, and their lids\ndrew close together with a lascivious and encouraging look, so that the\nyoung man felt himself growing weak beneath the mute will of this woman\nwho was urging him to a crime. Then he was afraid, and to avoid any\nexplanation he smote his forehead, crying--\n\n\"Morel is to come back to-night; he will not refuse me, I hope\" (this\nwas one of his friends, the son of a very rich merchant); \"and I will\nbring it you to-morrow,\" he added.\n\nEmma did not seem to welcome this hope with all the joy he had expected.\nDid she suspect the lie? He went on, blushing--\n\n\"However, if you don't see me by three o'clock do not wait for me, my\ndarling. I must be off now; forgive me! Goodbye!\"\n\nHe pressed her hand, but it felt quite lifeless. Emma had no strength\nleft for any sentiment.\n\nFour o'clock struck, and she rose to return to Yonville, mechanically\nobeying the force of old habits.\n\nThe weather was fine. It was one of those March days, clear and sharp,\nwhen the sun shines in a perfectly white sky. The Rouen folk, in\nSunday-clothes, were walking about with happy looks. She reached the\nPlace du Parvis. People were coming out after vespers; the crowd flowed\nout through the three doors like a stream through the three arches of\na bridge, and in the middle one, more motionless than a rock, stood the\nbeadle.\n\nThen she remembered the day when, all anxious and full of hope, she had\nentered beneath this large nave, that had opened out before her, less\nprofound than her love; and she walked on weeping beneath her veil,\ngiddy, staggering, almost fainting.\n\n\"Take care!\" cried a voice issuing from the gate of a courtyard that was\nthrown open.\n\nShe stopped to let pass a black horse, pawing the ground between the\nshafts of a tilbury, driven by a gentleman in sable furs. Who was it?\nShe knew him. The carriage darted by and disappeared.\n\nWhy, it was he--the Viscount. She turned away; the street was empty. She\nwas so overwhelmed, so sad, that she had to lean against a wall to keep\nherself from falling.\n\nThen she thought she had been mistaken. Anyhow, she did not know. All\nwithin her and around her was abandoning her. She felt lost, sinking\nat random into indefinable abysses, and it was almost with joy that, on\nreaching the \"Croix-Rouge,\" she saw the good Homais, who was watching\na large box full of pharmaceutical stores being hoisted on to the\n\"Hirondelle.\" In his hand he held tied in a silk handkerchief six\ncheminots for his wife.\n\nMadame Homais was very fond of these small, heavy turban-shaped loaves,\nthat are eaten in Lent with salt butter; a last vestige of Gothic food\nthat goes back, perhaps, to the time of the Crusades, and with which\nthe robust Normans gorged themselves of yore, fancying they saw on the\ntable, in the light of the yellow torches, between tankards of hippocras\nand huge boars' heads, the heads of Saracens to be devoured. The\ndruggist's wife crunched them up as they had done--heroically, despite\nher wretched teeth. And so whenever Homais journeyed to town, he never\nfailed to bring her home some that he bought at the great baker's in the\nRue Massacre.\n\n\"Charmed to see you,\" he said, offering Emma a hand to help her into the\n\"Hirondelle.\" Then he hung up his cheminots to the cords of the netting,\nand remained bare-headed in an attitude pensive and Napoleonic.\n\nBut when the blind man appeared as usual at the foot of the hill he\nexclaimed--\n\n\"I can't understand why the authorities tolerate such culpable\nindustries. Such unfortunates should be locked up and forced to work.\nProgress, my word! creeps at a snail's pace. We are floundering about in\nmere barbarism.\"\n\nThe blind man held out his hat, that flapped about at the door, as if it\nwere a bag in the lining that had come unnailed.\n\n\"This,\" said the chemist, \"is a scrofulous affection.\"\n\nAnd though he knew the poor devil, he pretended to see him for the first\ntime, murmured something about \"cornea,\" \"opaque cornea,\" \"sclerotic,\"\n\"facies,\" then asked him in a paternal tone--\n\n\"My friend, have you long had this terrible infirmity? Instead of\ngetting drunk at the public, you'd do better to die yourself.\"\n\nHe advised him to take good wine, good beer, and good joints. The blind\nman went on with his song; he seemed, moreover, almost idiotic. At last\nMonsieur Homais opened his purse--\n\n\"Now there's a sou; give me back two lairds, and don't forget my advice:\nyou'll be the better for it.\"\n\nHivert openly cast some doubt on the efficacy of it. But the druggist\nsaid that he would cure himself with an antiphlogistic pomade of his own\ncomposition, and he gave his address--\"Monsieur Homais, near the market,\npretty well known.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Hivert, \"for all this trouble you'll give us your\nperformance.\"\n\nThe blind man sank down on his haunches, with his head thrown back,\nwhilst he rolled his greenish eyes, lolled out his tongue, and rubbed\nhis stomach with both hands as he uttered a kind of hollow yell like a\nfamished dog. Emma, filled with disgust, threw him over her shoulder\na five-franc piece. It was all her fortune. It seemed to her very fine\nthus to throw it away.\n\nThe coach had gone on again when suddenly Monsieur Homais leant out\nthrough the window, crying--\n\n\"No farinaceous or milk food, wear wool next the skin, and expose the\ndiseased parts to the smoke of juniper berries.\"\n\nThe sight of the well-known objects that defiled before her eyes\ngradually diverted Emma from her present trouble. An intolerable fatigue\noverwhelmed her, and she reached her home stupefied, discouraged, almost\nasleep.\n\n\"Come what may come!\" she said to herself. \"And then, who knows? Why, at\nany moment could not some extraordinary event occur? Lheureux even might\ndie!\"\n\nAt nine o'clock in the morning she was awakened by the sound of voices\nin the Place. There was a crowd round the market reading a large bill\nfixed to one of the posts, and she saw Justin, who was climbing on to\na stone and tearing down the bill. But at this moment the rural guard\nseized him by the collar. Monsieur Homais came out of his shop, and Mere\nLefrangois, in the midst of the crowd, seemed to be perorating.\n\n\"Madame! madame!\" cried Felicite, running in, \"it's abominable!\"\n\nAnd the poor girl, deeply moved, handed her a yellow paper that she had\njust torn off the door. Emma read with a glance that all her furniture\nwas for sale.\n\nThen they looked at one another silently. The servant and mistress had\nno secret one from the other. At last Felicite sighed--\n\n\"If I were you, madame, I should go to Monsieur Guillaumin.\"\n\n\"Do you think--\"\n\nAnd this question meant to say--\n\n\"You who know the house through the servant, has the master spoken\nsometimes of me?\"\n\n\"Yes, you'd do well to go there.\"\n\nShe dressed, put on her black gown, and her hood with jet beads, and\nthat she might not be seen (there was still a crowd on the Place), she\ntook the path by the river, outside the village.\n\nShe reached the notary's gate quite breathless. The sky was sombre, and\na little snow was falling. At the sound of the bell, Theodore in a\nred waistcoat appeared on the steps; he came to open the door almost\nfamiliarly, as to an acquaintance, and showed her into the dining-room.\n\nA large porcelain stove crackled beneath a cactus that filled up the\nniche in the wall, and in black wood frames against the oak-stained\npaper hung Steuben's \"Esmeralda\" and Schopin's \"Potiphar.\" The\nready-laid table, the two silver chafing-dishes, the crystal door-knobs,\nthe parquet and the furniture, all shone with a scrupulous, English\ncleanliness; the windows were ornamented at each corner with stained\nglass.\n\n\"Now this,\" thought Emma, \"is the dining-room I ought to have.\"\n\nThe notary came in pressing his palm-leaf dressing-gown to his breast\nwith his left arm, while with the other hand he raised and quickly put\non again his brown velvet cap, pretentiously cocked on the right side,\nwhence looked out the ends of three fair curls drawn from the back of\nthe head, following the line of his bald skull.\n\nAfter he had offered her a seat he sat down to breakfast, apologising\nprofusely for his rudeness.\n\n\"I have come,\" she said, \"to beg you, sir--\"\n\n\"What, madame? I am listening.\"\n\nAnd she began explaining her position to him. Monsieur Guillaumin knew\nit, being secretly associated with the linendraper, from whom he always\ngot capital for the loans on mortgages that he was asked to make.\n\nSo he knew (and better than she herself) the long story of the bills,\nsmall at first, bearing different names as endorsers, made out at long\ndates, and constantly renewed up to the day, when, gathering together\nall the protested bills, the shopkeeper had bidden his friend Vincart\ntake in his own name all the necessary proceedings, not wishing to pass\nfor a tiger with his fellow-citizens.\n\nShe mingled her story with recriminations against Lheureux, to which the\nnotary replied from time to time with some insignificant word. Eating\nhis cutlet and drinking his tea, he buried his chin in his sky-blue\ncravat, into which were thrust two diamond pins, held together by a\nsmall gold chain; and he smiled a singular smile, in a sugary, ambiguous\nfashion. But noticing that her feet were damp, he said--\n\n\"Do get closer to the stove; put your feet up against the porcelain.\"\n\nShe was afraid of dirtying it. The notary replied in a gallant tone--\n\n\"Beautiful things spoil nothing.\"\n\nThen she tried to move him, and, growing moved herself, she began\ntelling him about the poorness of her home, her worries, her wants.\nHe could understand that; an elegant woman! and, without leaving off\neating, he had turned completely round towards her, so that his knee\nbrushed against her boot, whose sole curled round as it smoked against\nthe stove.\n\nBut when she asked for a thousand sous, he closed his lips, and declared\nhe was very sorry he had not had the management of her fortune before,\nfor there were hundreds of ways very convenient, even for a lady, of\nturning her money to account. They might, either in the turf-peats\nof Grumesnil or building-ground at Havre, almost without risk, have\nventured on some excellent speculations; and he let her consume herself\nwith rage at the thought of the fabulous sums that she would certainly\nhave made.\n\n\"How was it,\" he went on, \"that you didn't come to me?\"\n\n\"I hardly know,\" she said.\n\n\"Why, hey? Did I frighten you so much? It is I, on the contrary, who\nought to complain. We hardly know one another; yet I am very devoted to\nyou. You do not doubt that, I hope?\"\n\nHe held out his hand, took hers, covered it with a greedy kiss, then\nheld it on his knee; and he played delicately with her fingers whilst\nhe murmured a thousand blandishments. His insipid voice murmured like a\nrunning brook; a light shone in his eyes through the glimmering of his\nspectacles, and his hand was advancing up Emma's sleeve to press her\narm. She felt against her cheek his panting breath. This man oppressed\nher horribly.\n\nShe sprang up and said to him--\n\n\"Sir, I am waiting.\"\n\n\"For what?\" said the notary, who suddenly became very pale.\n\n\"This money.\"\n\n\"But--\" Then, yielding to the outburst of too powerful a desire, \"Well,\nyes!\"\n\nHe dragged himself towards her on his knees, regardless of his\ndressing-gown.\n\n\"For pity's sake, stay. I love you!\"\n\nHe seized her by her waist. Madame Bovary's face flushed purple. She\nrecoiled with a terrible look, crying--\n\n\"You are taking a shameless advantage of my distress, sir! I am to be\npitied--not to be sold.\"\n\nAnd she went out.\n\nThe notary remained quite stupefied, his eyes fixed on his fine\nembroidered slippers. They were a love gift, and the sight of them at\nlast consoled him. Besides, he reflected that such an adventure might\nhave carried him too far.\n\n\"What a wretch! what a scoundrel! what an infamy!\" she said to herself,\nas she fled with nervous steps beneath the aspens of the path. The\ndisappointment of her failure increased the indignation of her outraged\nmodesty; it seemed to her that Providence pursued her implacably, and,\nstrengthening herself in her pride, she had never felt so much esteem\nfor herself nor so much contempt for others. A spirit of warfare\ntransformed her. She would have liked to strike all men, to spit in\ntheir faces, to crush them, and she walked rapidly straight on, pale,\nquivering, maddened, searching the empty horizon with tear-dimmed eyes,\nand as it were rejoicing in the hate that was choking her.\n\nWhen she saw her house a numbness came over her. She could not go on;\nand yet she must. Besides, whither could she flee?\n\nFelicite was waiting for her at the door. \"Well?\"\n\n\"No!\" said Emma.\n\nAnd for a quarter of an hour the two of them went over the various\npersons in Yonville who might perhaps be inclined to help her. But each\ntime that Felicite named someone Emma replied--\n\n\"Impossible! they will not!\"\n\n\"And the master'll soon be in.\"\n\n\"I know that well enough. Leave me alone.\"\n\nShe had tried everything; there was nothing more to be done now; and\nwhen Charles came in she would have to say to him--\n\n\"Go away! This carpet on which you are walking is no longer ours. In\nyour own house you do not possess a chair, a pin, a straw, and it is I,\npoor man, who have ruined you.\"\n\nThen there would be a great sob; next he would weep abundantly, and at\nlast, the surprise past, he would forgive her.\n\n\"Yes,\" she murmured, grinding her teeth, \"he will forgive me, he who\nwould give a million if I would forgive him for having known me! Never!\nnever!\"\n\nThis thought of Bovary's superiority to her exasperated her. Then,\nwhether she confessed or did not confess, presently, immediately,\nto-morrow, he would know the catastrophe all the same; so she must wait\nfor this horrible scene, and bear the weight of his magnanimity. The\ndesire to return to Lheureux's seized her--what would be the use? To\nwrite to her father--it was too late; and perhaps, she began to repent\nnow that she had not yielded to that other, when she heard the trot of\na horse in the alley. It was he; he was opening the gate; he was whiter\nthan the plaster wall. Rushing to the stairs, she ran out quickly to the\nsquare; and the wife of the mayor, who was talking to Lestiboudois in\nfront of the church, saw her go in to the tax-collector's.\n\nShe hurried off to tell Madame Caron, and the two ladies went up to\nthe attic, and, hidden by some linen spread across props, stationed\nthemselves comfortably for overlooking the whole of Binet's room.\n\nHe was alone in his garret, busy imitating in wood one of those\nindescribable bits of ivory, composed of crescents, of spheres hollowed\nout one within the other, the whole as straight as an obelisk, and of no\nuse whatever; and he was beginning on the last piece--he was nearing his\ngoal. In the twilight of the workshop the white dust was flying from his\ntools like a shower of sparks under the hoofs of a galloping horse; the\ntwo wheels were turning, droning; Binet smiled, his chin lowered, his\nnostrils distended, and, in a word, seemed lost in one of those complete\nhappinesses that, no doubt, belong only to commonplace occupations,\nwhich amuse the mind with facile difficulties, and satisfy by a\nrealisation of that beyond which such minds have not a dream.\n\n\"Ah! there she is!\" exclaimed Madame Tuvache.\n\nBut it was impossible because of the lathe to hear what she was saying.\n\nAt last these ladies thought they made out the word \"francs,\" and Madame\nTuvache whispered in a low voice--\n\n\"She is begging him to give her time for paying her taxes.\"\n\n\"Apparently!\" replied the other.\n\nThey saw her walking up and down, examining the napkin-rings, the\ncandlesticks, the banister rails against the walls, while Binet stroked\nhis beard with satisfaction.\n\n\"Do you think she wants to order something of him?\" said Madame Tuvache.\n\n\"Why, he doesn't sell anything,\" objected her neighbour.\n\nThe tax-collector seemed to be listening with wide-open eyes, as if he\ndid not understand. She went on in a tender, suppliant manner. She came\nnearer to him, her breast heaving; they no longer spoke.\n\n\"Is she making him advances?\" said Madame Tuvache. Binet was scarlet to\nhis very ears. She took hold of his hands.\n\n\"Oh, it's too much!\"\n\nAnd no doubt she was suggesting something abominable to him; for the\ntax-collector--yet he was brave, had fought at Bautzen and at Lutzen,\nhad been through the French campaign, and had even been recommended for\nthe cross--suddenly, as at the sight of a serpent, recoiled as far as he\ncould from her, crying--\n\n\"Madame! what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Women like that ought to be whipped,\" said Madame Tuvache.\n\n\"But where is she?\" continued Madame Caron, for she had disappeared\nwhilst they spoke; then catching sight of her going up the Grande Rue,\nand turning to the right as if making for the cemetery, they were lost\nin conjectures.\n\n\"Nurse Rollet,\" she said on reaching the nurse's, \"I am choking; unlace\nme!\" She fell on the bed sobbing. Nurse Rollet covered her with a\npetticoat and remained standing by her side. Then, as she did not\nanswer, the good woman withdrew, took her wheel and began spinning flax.\n\n\"Oh, leave off!\" she murmured, fancying she heard Binet's lathe.\n\n\"What's bothering her?\" said the nurse to herself. \"Why has she come\nhere?\"\n\nShe had rushed thither; impelled by a kind of horror that drove her from\nher home.\n\nLying on her back, motionless, and with staring eyes, she saw things but\nvaguely, although she tried to with idiotic persistence. She looked\nat the scales on the walls, two brands smoking end to end, and a long\nspider crawling over her head in a rent in the beam. At last she began\nto collect her thoughts. She remembered--one day--Leon--Oh! how long\nago that was--the sun was shining on the river, and the clematis were\nperfuming the air. Then, carried away as by a rushing torrent, she soon\nbegan to recall the day before.\n\n\"What time is it?\" she asked.\n\nMere Rollet went out, raised the fingers of her right hand to that side\nof the sky that was brightest, and came back slowly, saying--\n\n\"Nearly three.\"\n\n\"Ah! thanks, thanks!\"\n\nFor he would come; he would have found some money. But he would,\nperhaps, go down yonder, not guessing she was here, and she told the\nnurse to run to her house to fetch him.\n\n\"Be quick!\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady, I'm going, I'm going!\"\n\nShe wondered now that she had not thought of him from the first.\nYesterday he had given his word; he would not break it. And she already\nsaw herself at Lheureux's spreading out her three bank-notes on his\nbureau. Then she would have to invent some story to explain matters to\nBovary. What should it be?\n\nThe nurse, however, was a long while gone. But, as there was no clock\nin the cot, Emma feared she was perhaps exaggerating the length of time.\nShe began walking round the garden, step by step; she went into the path\nby the hedge, and returned quickly, hoping that the woman would have\ncome back by another road. At last, weary of waiting, assailed by fears\nthat she thrust from her, no longer conscious whether she had been here\na century or a moment, she sat down in a corner, closed her eyes, and\nstopped her ears. The gate grated; she sprang up. Before she had spoken\nMere Rollet said to her--\n\n\"There is no one at your house!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Oh, no one! And the doctor is crying. He is calling for you; they're\nlooking for you.\"\n\nEmma answered nothing. She gasped as she turned her eyes about\nher, while the peasant woman, frightened at her face, drew back\ninstinctively, thinking her mad. Suddenly she struck her brow and\nuttered a cry; for the thought of Rodolphe, like a flash of lightning in\na dark night, had passed into her soul. He was so good, so delicate, so\ngenerous! And besides, should he hesitate to do her this service, she\nwould know well enough how to constrain him to it by re-waking, in a\nsingle moment, their lost love. So she set out towards La Huchette, not\nseeing that she was hastening to offer herself to that which but a while\nago had so angered her, not in the least conscious of her prostitution.\n\n\n\nChapter Eight\n\nShe asked herself as she walked along, \"What am I going to say? How\nshall I begin?\" And as she went on she recognised the thickets,\nthe trees, the sea-rushes on the hill, the chateau yonder. All the\nsensations of her first tenderness came back to her, and her poor aching\nheart opened out amorously. A warm wind blew in her face; the melting\nsnow fell drop by drop from the buds to the grass.\n\nShe entered, as she used to, through the small park-gate. She reached\nthe avenue bordered by a double row of dense lime-trees. They were\nswaying their long whispering branches to and fro. The dogs in their\nkennels all barked, and the noise of their voices resounded, but brought\nout no one.\n\nShe went up the large straight staircase with wooden balusters that led\nto the corridor paved with dusty flags, into which several doors in a\nrow opened, as in a monastery or an inn. His was at the top, right\nat the end, on the left. When she placed her fingers on the lock her\nstrength suddenly deserted her. She was afraid, almost wished he\nwould not be there, though this was her only hope, her last chance of\nsalvation. She collected her thoughts for one moment, and, strengthening\nherself by the feeling of present necessity, went in.\n\nHe was in front of the fire, both his feet on the mantelpiece, smoking a\npipe.\n\n\"What! it is you!\" he said, getting up hurriedly.\n\n\"Yes, it is I, Rodolphe. I should like to ask your advice.\"\n\nAnd, despite all her efforts, it was impossible for her to open her\nlips.\n\n\"You have not changed; you are charming as ever!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" she replied bitterly, \"they are poor charms since you disdained\nthem.\"\n\nThen he began a long explanation of his conduct, excusing himself in\nvague terms, in default of being able to invent better.\n\nShe yielded to his words, still more to his voice and the sight of him,\nso that, she pretended to believe, or perhaps believed; in the pretext\nhe gave for their rupture; this was a secret on which depended the\nhonour, the very life of a third person.\n\n\"No matter!\" she said, looking at him sadly. \"I have suffered much.\"\n\nHe replied philosophically--\n\n\"Such is life!\"\n\n\"Has life,\" Emma went on, \"been good to you at least, since our\nseparation?\"\n\n\"Oh, neither good nor bad.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it would have been better never to have parted.\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps.\"\n\n\"You think so?\" she said, drawing nearer, and she sighed. \"Oh, Rodolphe!\nif you but knew! I loved you so!\"\n\nIt was then that she took his hand, and they remained some time, their\nfingers intertwined, like that first day at the Show. With a gesture of\npride he struggled against this emotion. But sinking upon his breast she\nsaid to him--\n\n\"How did you think I could live without you? One cannot lose the habit\nof happiness. I was desolate. I thought I should die. I will tell you\nabout all that and you will see. And you--you fled from me!\"\n\nFor, all the three years, he had carefully avoided her in consequence\nof that natural cowardice that characterises the stronger sex. Emma went\non, with dainty little nods, more coaxing than an amorous kitten--\n\n\"You love others, confess it! Oh, I understand them, dear! I excuse\nthem. You probably seduced them as you seduced me. You are indeed a man;\nyou have everything to make one love you. But we'll begin again, won't\nwe? We will love one another. See! I am laughing; I am happy! Oh,\nspeak!\"\n\nAnd she was charming to see, with her eyes, in which trembled a tear,\nlike the rain of a storm in a blue corolla.\n\nHe had drawn her upon his knees, and with the back of his hand was\ncaressing her smooth hair, where in the twilight was mirrored like a\ngolden arrow one last ray of the sun. She bent down her brow; at last he\nkissed her on the eyelids quite gently with the tips of his lips.\n\n\"Why, you have been crying! What for?\"\n\nShe burst into tears. Rodolphe thought this was an outburst of her\nlove. As she did not speak, he took this silence for a last remnant of\nresistance, and then he cried out--\n\n\"Oh, forgive me! You are the only one who pleases me. I was imbecile and\ncruel. I love you. I will love you always. What is it. Tell me!\" He was\nkneeling by her.\n\n\"Well, I am ruined, Rodolphe! You must lend me three thousand francs.\"\n\n\"But--but--\" said he, getting up slowly, while his face assumed a grave\nexpression.\n\n\"You know,\" she went on quickly, \"that my husband had placed his whole\nfortune at a notary's. He ran away. So we borrowed; the patients don't\npay us. Moreover, the settling of the estate is not yet done; we shall\nhave the money later on. But to-day, for want of three thousand francs,\nwe are to be sold up. It is to be at once, this very moment, and,\ncounting upon your friendship, I have come to you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" thought Rodolphe, turning very pale, \"that was what she came for.\"\nAt last he said with a calm air--\n\n\"Dear madame, I have not got them.\"\n\nHe did not lie. If he had had them, he would, no doubt, have given them,\nalthough it is generally disagreeable to do such fine things: a demand\nfor money being, of all the winds that blow upon love, the coldest and\nmost destructive.\n\nFirst she looked at him for some moments.\n\n\"You have not got them!\" she repeated several times. \"You have not got\nthem! I ought to have spared myself this last shame. You never loved me.\nYou are no better than the others.\"\n\nShe was betraying, ruining herself.\n\nRodolphe interrupted her, declaring he was \"hard up\" himself.\n\n\"Ah! I pity you,\" said Emma. \"Yes--very much.\"\n\nAnd fixing her eyes upon an embossed carabine, that shone against its\npanoply, \"But when one is so poor one doesn't have silver on the butt of\none's gun. One doesn't buy a clock inlaid with tortoise shell,\" she went\non, pointing to a buhl timepiece, \"nor silver-gilt whistles for one's\nwhips,\" and she touched them, \"nor charms for one's watch. Oh, he wants\nfor nothing! even to a liqueur-stand in his room! For you love yourself;\nyou live well. You have a chateau, farms, woods; you go hunting; you\ntravel to Paris. Why, if it were but that,\" she cried, taking up two\nstuds from the mantelpiece, \"but the least of these trifles, one can get\nmoney for them. Oh, I do not want them, keep them!\"\n\nAnd she threw the two links away from her, their gold chain breaking as\nit struck against the wall.\n\n\"But I! I would have given you everything. I would have sold all, worked\nfor you with my hands, I would have begged on the highroads for a smile,\nfor a look, to hear you say 'Thanks!' And you sit there quietly in your\narm-chair, as if you had not made me suffer enough already! But for you,\nand you know it, I might have lived happily. What made you do it? Was\nit a bet? Yet you loved me--you said so. And but a moment since--Ah!\nit would have been better to have driven me away. My hands are hot with\nyour kisses, and there is the spot on the carpet where at my knees you\nswore an eternity of love! You made me believe you; for two years you\nheld me in the most magnificent, the sweetest dream! Eh! Our plans for\nthe journey, do you remember? Oh, your letter! your letter! it tore my\nheart! And then when I come back to him--to him, rich, happy, free--to\nimplore the help the first stranger would give, a suppliant, and\nbringing back to him all my tenderness, he repulses me because it would\ncost him three thousand francs!\"\n\n\"I haven't got them,\" replied Rodolphe, with that perfect calm with\nwhich resigned rage covers itself as with a shield.\n\nShe went out. The walls trembled, the ceiling was crushing her, and she\npassed back through the long alley, stumbling against the heaps of dead\nleaves scattered by the wind. At last she reached the ha-ha hedge in\nfront of the gate; she broke her nails against the lock in her haste to\nopen it. Then a hundred steps farther on, breathless, almost falling,\nshe stopped. And now turning round, she once more saw the impassive\nchateau, with the park, the gardens, the three courts, and all the\nwindows of the facade.\n\nShe remained lost in stupor, and having no more consciousness of herself\nthan through the beating of her arteries, that she seemed to hear\nbursting forth like a deafening music filling all the fields. The earth\nbeneath her feet was more yielding than the sea, and the furrows seemed\nto her immense brown waves breaking into foam. Everything in her\nhead, of memories, ideas, went off at once like a thousand pieces of\nfireworks. She saw her father, Lheureux's closet, their room at home,\nanother landscape. Madness was coming upon her; she grew afraid, and\nmanaged to recover herself, in a confused way, it is true, for she did\nnot in the least remember the cause of the terrible condition she was\nin, that is to say, the question of money. She suffered only in her\nlove, and felt her soul passing from her in this memory; as wounded men,\ndying, feel their life ebb from their bleeding wounds.\n\nNight was falling, crows were flying about.\n\nSuddenly it seemed to her that fiery spheres were exploding in the air\nlike fulminating balls when they strike, and were whirling, whirling,\nto melt at last upon the snow between the branches of the trees. In the\nmidst of each of them appeared the face of Rodolphe. They multiplied and\ndrew near her, penetrating, her. It all disappeared; she recognised the\nlights of the houses that shone through the fog.\n\nNow her situation, like an abyss, rose up before her. She was panting as\nif her heart would burst. Then in an ecstasy of heroism, that made\nher almost joyous, she ran down the hill, crossed the cow-plank, the\nfoot-path, the alley, the market, and reached the chemist's shop. She\nwas about to enter, but at the sound of the bell someone might come, and\nslipping in by the gate, holding her breath, feeling her way along the\nwalls, she went as far as the door of the kitchen, where a candle stuck\non the stove was burning. Justin in his shirt-sleeves was carrying out a\ndish.\n\n\"Ah! they are dining; I will wait.\"\n\nHe returned; she tapped at the window. He went out.\n\n\"The key! the one for upstairs where he keeps the--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nAnd he looked at her, astonished at the pallor of her face, that stood\nout white against the black background of the night. She seemed to\nhim extraordinarily beautiful and majestic as a phantom. Without\nunderstanding what she wanted, he had the presentiment of something\nterrible.\n\nBut she went on quickly in a love voice; in a sweet, melting voice, \"I\nwant it; give it to me.\"\n\nAs the partition wall was thin, they could hear the clatter of the forks\non the plates in the dining-room.\n\nShe pretended that she wanted to kill the rats that kept her from\nsleeping.\n\n\"I must tell master.\"\n\n\"No, stay!\" Then with an indifferent air, \"Oh, it's not worth while;\nI'll tell him presently. Come, light me upstairs.\"\n\nShe entered the corridor into which the laboratory door opened. Against\nthe wall was a key labelled Capharnaum.\n\n\"Justin!\" called the druggist impatiently.\n\n\"Let us go up.\"\n\nAnd he followed her. The key turned in the lock, and she went straight\nto the third shelf, so well did her memory guide her, seized the blue\njar, tore out the cork, plunged in her hand, and withdrawing it full of\na white powder, she began eating it.\n\n\"Stop!\" he cried, rushing at her.\n\n\"Hush! someone will come.\"\n\nHe was in despair, was calling out.\n\n\"Say nothing, or all the blame will fall on your master.\"\n\nThen she went home, suddenly calmed, and with something of the serenity\nof one that had performed a duty.\n\nWhen Charles, distracted by the news of the distraint, returned home,\nEmma had just gone out. He cried aloud, wept, fainted, but she did not\nreturn. Where could she be? He sent Felicite to Homais, to Monsieur\nTuvache, to Lheureux, to the \"Lion d'Or,\" everywhere, and in the\nintervals of his agony he saw his reputation destroyed, their fortune\nlost, Berthe's future ruined. By what?--Not a word! He waited till six\nin the evening. At last, unable to bear it any longer, and fancying she\nhad gone to Rouen, he set out along the highroad, walked a mile, met no\none, again waited, and returned home. She had come back.\n\n\"What was the matter? Why? Explain to me.\"\n\nShe sat down at her writing-table and wrote a letter, which she sealed\nslowly, adding the date and the hour. Then she said in a solemn tone:\n\n\"You are to read it to-morrow; till then, I pray you, do not ask me a\nsingle question. No, not one!\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"Oh, leave me!\"\n\nShe lay down full length on her bed. A bitter taste that she felt in her\nmouth awakened her. She saw Charles, and again closed her eyes.\n\nShe was studying herself curiously, to see if she were not suffering.\nBut no! nothing as yet. She heard the ticking of the clock, the\ncrackling of the fire, and Charles breathing as he stood upright by her\nbed.\n\n\"Ah! it is but a little thing, death!\" she thought. \"I shall fall asleep\nand all will be over.\"\n\nShe drank a mouthful of water and turned to the wall. The frightful\ntaste of ink continued.\n\n\"I am thirsty; oh! so thirsty,\" she sighed.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Charles, who was handing her a glass.\n\n\"It is nothing! Open the window; I am choking.\"\n\nShe was seized with a sickness so sudden that she had hardly time to\ndraw out her handkerchief from under the pillow.\n\n\"Take it away,\" she said quickly; \"throw it away.\"\n\nHe spoke to her; she did not answer. She lay motionless, afraid that\nthe slightest movement might make her vomit. But she felt an icy cold\ncreeping from her feet to her heart.\n\n\"Ah! it is beginning,\" she murmured.\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\nShe turned her head from side to side with a gentle movement full of\nagony, while constantly opening her mouth as if something very heavy\nwere weighing upon her tongue. At eight o'clock the vomiting began\nagain.\n\nCharles noticed that at the bottom of the basin there was a sort of\nwhite sediment sticking to the sides of the porcelain.\n\n\"This is extraordinary--very singular,\" he repeated.\n\nBut she said in a firm voice, \"No, you are mistaken.\"\n\nThen gently, and almost as caressing her, he passed his hand over her\nstomach. She uttered a sharp cry. He fell back terror-stricken.\n\nThen she began to groan, faintly at first. Her shoulders were shaken by\na strong shuddering, and she was growing paler than the sheets in which\nher clenched fingers buried themselves. Her unequal pulse was now almost\nimperceptible.\n\nDrops of sweat oozed from her bluish face, that seemed as if rigid in\nthe exhalations of a metallic vapour. Her teeth chattered, her dilated\neyes looked vaguely about her, and to all questions she replied only\nwith a shake of the head; she even smiled once or twice. Gradually, her\nmoaning grew louder; a hollow shriek burst from her; she pretended she\nwas better and that she would get up presently. But she was seized with\nconvulsions and cried out--\n\n\"Ah! my God! It is horrible!\"\n\nHe threw himself on his knees by her bed.\n\n\"Tell me! what have you eaten? Answer, for heaven's sake!\"\n\nAnd he looked at her with a tenderness in his eyes such as she had never\nseen.\n\n\"Well, there--there!\" she said in a faint voice. He flew to the\nwriting-table, tore open the seal, and read aloud: \"Accuse no one.\" He\nstopped, passed his hands across his eyes, and read it over again.\n\n\"What! help--help!\"\n\nHe could only keep repeating the word: \"Poisoned! poisoned!\" Felicite\nran to Homais, who proclaimed it in the market-place; Madame Lefrancois\nheard it at the \"Lion d'Or\"; some got up to go and tell their\nneighbours, and all night the village was on the alert.\n\nDistraught, faltering, reeling, Charles wandered about the room. He\nknocked against the furniture, tore his hair, and the chemist had never\nbelieved that there could be so terrible a sight.\n\nHe went home to write to Monsieur Canivet and to Doctor Lariviere. He\nlost his head, and made more than fifteen rough copies. Hippolyte went\nto Neufchatel, and Justin so spurred Bovary's horse that he left it\nfoundered and three parts dead by the hill at Bois-Guillaume.\n\nCharles tried to look up his medical dictionary, but could not read it;\nthe lines were dancing.\n\n\"Be calm,\" said the druggist; \"we have only to administer a powerful\nantidote. What is the poison?\"\n\nCharles showed him the letter. It was arsenic.\n\n\"Very well,\" said Homais, \"we must make an analysis.\"\n\nFor he knew that in cases of poisoning an analysis must be made; and the\nother, who did not understand, answered--\n\n\"Oh, do anything! save her!\"\n\nThen going back to her, he sank upon the carpet, and lay there with his\nhead leaning against the edge of her bed, sobbing.\n\n\"Don't cry,\" she said to him. \"Soon I shall not trouble you any more.\"\n\n\"Why was it? Who drove you to it?\"\n\nShe replied. \"It had to be, my dear!\"\n\n\"Weren't you happy? Is it my fault? I did all I could!\"\n\n\"Yes, that is true--you are good--you.\"\n\nAnd she passed her hand slowly over his hair. The sweetness of this\nsensation deepened his sadness; he felt his whole being dissolving\nin despair at the thought that he must lose her, just when she was\nconfessing more love for him than ever. And he could think of nothing;\nhe did not know, he did not dare; the urgent need for some immediate\nresolution gave the finishing stroke to the turmoil of his mind.\n\nSo she had done, she thought, with all the treachery; and meanness,\nand numberless desires that had tortured her. She hated no one now; a\ntwilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts, and, of all earthly\nnoises, Emma heard none but the intermittent lamentations of this poor\nheart, sweet and indistinct like the echo of a symphony dying away.\n\n\"Bring me the child,\" she said, raising herself on her elbow.\n\n\"You are not worse, are you?\" asked Charles.\n\n\"No, no!\"\n\nThe child, serious, and still half-asleep, was carried in on the\nservant's arm in her long white nightgown, from which her bare\nfeet peeped out. She looked wonderingly at the disordered room, and\nhalf-closed her eyes, dazzled by the candles burning on the table. They\nreminded her, no doubt, of the morning of New Year's day and Mid-Lent,\nwhen thus awakened early by candle-light she came to her mother's bed to\nfetch her presents, for she began saying--\n\n\"But where is it, mamma?\" And as everybody was silent, \"But I can't see\nmy little stocking.\"\n\nFelicite held her over the bed while she still kept looking towards the\nmantelpiece.\n\n\"Has nurse taken it?\" she asked.\n\nAnd at this name, that carried her back to the memory of her adulteries\nand her calamities, Madame Bovary turned away her head, as at the\nloathing of another bitterer poison that rose to her mouth. But Berthe\nremained perched on the bed.\n\n\"Oh, how big your eyes are, mamma! How pale you are! how hot you are!\"\n\nHer mother looked at her. \"I am frightened!\" cried the child, recoiling.\n\nEmma took her hand to kiss it; the child struggled.\n\n\"That will do. Take her away,\" cried Charles, who was sobbing in the\nalcove.\n\nThen the symptoms ceased for a moment; she seemed less agitated; and at\nevery insignificant word, at every respiration a little more easy, he\nregained hope. At last, when Canivet came in, he threw himself into his\narms.\n\n\"Ah! it is you. Thanks! You are good! But she is better. See! look at\nher.\"\n\nHis colleague was by no means of this opinion, and, as he said of\nhimself, \"never beating about the bush,\" he prescribed, an emetic in\norder to empty the stomach completely.\n\nShe soon began vomiting blood. Her lips became drawn. Her limbs were\nconvulsed, her whole body covered with brown spots, and her pulse\nslipped beneath the fingers like a stretched thread, like a harp-string\nnearly breaking.\n\nAfter this she began to scream horribly. She cursed the poison, railed\nat it, and implored it to be quick, and thrust away with her stiffened\narms everything that Charles, in more agony than herself, tried to make\nher drink. He stood up, his handkerchief to his lips, with a rattling\nsound in his throat, weeping, and choked by sobs that shook his whole\nbody. Felicite was running hither and thither in the room. Homais,\nmotionless, uttered great sighs; and Monsieur Canivet, always retaining\nhis self-command, nevertheless began to feel uneasy.\n\n\"The devil! yet she has been purged, and from the moment that the cause\nceases--\"\n\n\"The effect must cease,\" said Homais, \"that is evident.\"\n\n\"Oh, save her!\" cried Bovary.\n\nAnd, without listening to the chemist, who was still venturing the\nhypothesis, \"It is perhaps a salutary paroxysm,\" Canivet was about to\nadminister some theriac, when they heard the cracking of a whip; all the\nwindows rattled, and a post-chaise drawn by three horses abreast, up to\ntheir ears in mud, drove at a gallop round the corner of the market. It\nwas Doctor Lariviere.\n\nThe apparition of a god would not have caused more commotion. Bovary\nraised his hands; Canivet stopped short; and Homais pulled off his\nskull-cap long before the doctor had come in.\n\nHe belonged to that great school of surgery begotten of Bichat, to that\ngeneration, now extinct, of philosophical practitioners, who, loving\ntheir art with a fanatical love, exercised it with enthusiasm and\nwisdom. Everyone in his hospital trembled when he was angry; and his\nstudents so revered him that they tried, as soon as they were themselves\nin practice, to imitate him as much as possible. So that in all the\ntowns about they were found wearing his long wadded merino overcoat\nand black frock-coat, whose buttoned cuffs slightly covered his brawny\nhands--very beautiful hands, and that never knew gloves, as though to be\nmore ready to plunge into suffering. Disdainful of honours, of titles,\nand of academies, like one of the old Knight-Hospitallers, generous,\nfatherly to the poor, and practising virtue without believing in it, he\nwould almost have passed for a saint if the keenness of his intellect\nhad not caused him to be feared as a demon. His glance, more penetrating\nthan his bistouries, looked straight into your soul, and dissected every\nlie athwart all assertions and all reticences. And thus he went along,\nfull of that debonair majesty that is given by the consciousness\nof great talent, of fortune, and of forty years of a labourious and\nirreproachable life.\n\nHe frowned as soon as he had passed the door when he saw the cadaverous\nface of Emma stretched out on her back with her mouth open. Then, while\napparently listening to Canivet, he rubbed his fingers up and down\nbeneath his nostrils, and repeated--\n\n\"Good! good!\"\n\nBut he made a slow gesture with his shoulders. Bovary watched him; they\nlooked at one another; and this man, accustomed as he was to the sight\nof pain, could not keep back a tear that fell on his shirt-frill.\n\nHe tried to take Canivet into the next room. Charles followed him.\n\n\"She is very ill, isn't she? If we put on sinapisms? Anything! Oh, think\nof something, you who have saved so many!\"\n\nCharles caught him in both his arms, and gazed at him wildly,\nimploringly, half-fainting against his breast.\n\n\"Come, my poor fellow, courage! There is nothing more to be done.\"\n\nAnd Doctor Lariviere turned away.\n\n\"You are going?\"\n\n\"I will come back.\"\n\nHe went out only to give an order to the coachman, with Monsieur\nCanivet, who did not care either to have Emma die under his hands.\n\nThe chemist rejoined them on the Place. He could not by temperament keep\naway from celebrities, so he begged Monsieur Lariviere to do him the\nsignal honour of accepting some breakfast.\n\nHe sent quickly to the \"Lion d'Or\" for some pigeons; to the butcher's\nfor all the cutlets that were to be had; to Tuvache for cream; and\nto Lestiboudois for eggs; and the druggist himself aided in the\npreparations, while Madame Homais was saying as she pulled together the\nstrings of her jacket--\n\n\"You must excuse us, sir, for in this poor place, when one hasn't been\ntold the night before--\"\n\n\"Wine glasses!\" whispered Homais.\n\n\"If only we were in town, we could fall back upon stuffed trotters.\"\n\n\"Be quiet! Sit down, doctor!\"\n\nHe thought fit, after the first few mouthfuls, to give some details as\nto the catastrophe.\n\n\"We first had a feeling of siccity in the pharynx, then intolerable\npains at the epigastrium, super purgation, coma.\"\n\n\"But how did she poison herself?\"\n\n\"I don't know, doctor, and I don't even know where she can have procured\nthe arsenious acid.\"\n\nJustin, who was just bringing in a pile of plates, began to tremble.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said the chemist.\n\nAt this question the young man dropped the whole lot on the ground with\na crash.\n\n\"Imbecile!\" cried Homais, \"awkward lout! block-head! confounded ass!\"\n\nBut suddenly controlling himself--\n\n\"I wished, doctor, to make an analysis, and primo I delicately\nintroduced a tube--\"\n\n\"You would have done better,\" said the physician, \"to introduce your\nfingers into her throat.\"\n\nHis colleague was silent, having just before privately received a severe\nlecture about his emetic, so that this good Canivet, so arrogant and so\nverbose at the time of the clubfoot, was to-day very modest. He smiled\nwithout ceasing in an approving manner.\n\nHomais dilated in Amphytrionic pride, and the affecting thought of\nBovary vaguely contributed to his pleasure by a kind of egotistic\nreflex upon himself. Then the presence of the doctor transported him.\nHe displayed his erudition, cited pell-mell cantharides, upas, the\nmanchineel, vipers.\n\n\"I have even read that various persons have found themselves\nunder toxicological symptoms, and, as it were, thunderstricken by\nblack-pudding that had been subjected to a too vehement fumigation.\nAt least, this was stated in a very fine report drawn up by one of our\npharmaceutical chiefs, one of our masters, the illustrious Cadet de\nGassicourt!\"\n\nMadame Homais reappeared, carrying one of those shaky machines that\nare heated with spirits of wine; for Homais liked to make his coffee\nat table, having, moreover, torrefied it, pulverised it, and mixed it\nhimself.\n\n\"Saccharum, doctor?\" said he, offering the sugar.\n\nThen he had all his children brought down, anxious to have the\nphysician's opinion on their constitutions.\n\nAt last Monsieur Lariviere was about to leave, when Madame Homais asked\nfor a consultation about her husband. He was making his blood too thick\nby going to sleep every evening after dinner.\n\n\"Oh, it isn't his blood that's too thick,\" said the physician.\n\nAnd, smiling a little at his unnoticed joke, the doctor opened the\ndoor. But the chemist's shop was full of people; he had the greatest\ndifficulty in getting rid of Monsieur Tuvache, who feared his spouse\nwould get inflammation of the lungs, because she was in the habit of\nspitting on the ashes; then of Monsieur Binet, who sometimes experienced\nsudden attacks of great hunger; and of Madame Caron, who suffered\nfrom tinglings; of Lheureux, who had vertigo; of Lestiboudois, who had\nrheumatism; and of Madame Lefrancois, who had heartburn. At last the\nthree horses started; and it was the general opinion that he had not\nshown himself at all obliging.\n\nPublic attention was distracted by the appearance of Monsieur\nBournisien, who was going across the market with the holy oil.\n\nHomais, as was due to his principles, compared priests to ravens\nattracted by the odour of death. The sight of an ecclesiastic was\npersonally disagreeable to him, for the cassock made him think of the\nshroud, and he detested the one from some fear of the other.\n\nNevertheless, not shrinking from what he called his mission, he returned\nto Bovary's in company with Canivet whom Monsieur Lariviere, before\nleaving, had strongly urged to make this visit; and he would, but for\nhis wife's objections, have taken his two sons with him, in order\nto accustom them to great occasions; that this might be a lesson, an\nexample, a solemn picture, that should remain in their heads later on.\n\nThe room when they went in was full of mournful solemnity. On the\nwork-table, covered over with a white cloth, there were five or six\nsmall balls of cotton in a silver dish, near a large crucifix between\ntwo lighted candles.\n\nEmma, her chin sunken upon her breast, had her eyes inordinately wide\nopen, and her poor hands wandered over the sheets with that hideous\nand soft movement of the dying, that seems as if they wanted already to\ncover themselves with the shroud. Pale as a statue and with eyes red as\nfire, Charles, not weeping, stood opposite her at the foot of the bed,\nwhile the priest, bending one knee, was muttering words in a low voice.\n\nShe turned her face slowly, and seemed filled with joy on seeing\nsuddenly the violet stole, no doubt finding again, in the midst of\na temporary lull in her pain, the lost voluptuousness of her first\nmystical transports, with the visions of eternal beatitude that were\nbeginning.\n\nThe priest rose to take the crucifix; then she stretched forward her\nneck as one who is athirst, and glueing her lips to the body of the\nMan-God, she pressed upon it with all her expiring strength the fullest\nkiss of love that she had ever given. Then he recited the Misereatur and\nthe Indulgentiam, dipped his right thumb in the oil, and began to give\nextreme unction. First upon the eyes, that had so coveted all worldly\npomp; then upon the nostrils, that had been greedy of the warm breeze\nand amorous odours; then upon the mouth, that had uttered lies, that had\ncurled with pride and cried out in lewdness; then upon the hands that\nhad delighted in sensual touches; and finally upon the soles of the\nfeet, so swift of yore, when she was running to satisfy her desires, and\nthat would now walk no more.\n\nThe cure wiped his fingers, threw the bit of cotton dipped in oil into\nthe fire, and came and sat down by the dying woman, to tell her that\nshe must now blend her sufferings with those of Jesus Christ and abandon\nherself to the divine mercy.\n\nFinishing his exhortations, he tried to place in her hand a blessed\ncandle, symbol of the celestial glory with which she was soon to be\nsurrounded. Emma, too weak, could not close her fingers, and the taper,\nbut for Monsieur Bournisien would have fallen to the ground.\n\nHowever, she was not quite so pale, and her face had an expression of\nserenity as if the sacrament had cured her.\n\nThe priest did not fail to point this out; he even explained to Bovary\nthat the Lord sometimes prolonged the life of persons when he thought it\nmeet for their salvation; and Charles remembered the day when, so near\ndeath, she had received the communion. Perhaps there was no need to\ndespair, he thought.\n\nIn fact, she looked around her slowly, as one awakening from a dream;\nthen in a distinct voice she asked for her looking-glass, and remained\nsome time bending over it, until the big tears fell from her eyes. Then\nshe turned away her head with a sigh and fell back upon the pillows.\n\nHer chest soon began panting rapidly; the whole of her tongue protruded\nfrom her mouth; her eyes, as they rolled, grew paler, like the two\nglobes of a lamp that is going out, so that one might have thought\nher already dead but for the fearful labouring of her ribs, shaken\nby violent breathing, as if the soul were struggling to free itself.\nFelicite knelt down before the crucifix, and the druggist himself\nslightly bent his knees, while Monsieur Canivet looked out vaguely at\nthe Place. Bournisien had again begun to pray, his face bowed against\nthe edge of the bed, his long black cassock trailing behind him in the\nroom. Charles was on the other side, on his knees, his arms outstretched\ntowards Emma. He had taken her hands and pressed them, shuddering at\nevery beat of her heart, as at the shaking of a falling ruin. As the\ndeath-rattle became stronger the priest prayed faster; his prayers\nmingled with the stifled sobs of Bovary, and sometimes all seemed lost\nin the muffled murmur of the Latin syllables that tolled like a passing\nbell.\n\nSuddenly on the pavement was heard a loud noise of clogs and the\nclattering of a stick; and a voice rose--a raucous voice--that sang--\n\n\"Maids in the warmth of a summer day Dream of love and of love always\"\n\nEmma raised herself like a galvanised corpse, her hair undone, her eyes\nfixed, staring.\n\n\"Where the sickle blades have been, Nannette, gathering ears of corn,\nPasses bending down, my queen, To the earth where they were born.\"\n\n\"The blind man!\" she cried. And Emma began to laugh, an atrocious,\nfrantic, despairing laugh, thinking she saw the hideous face of the poor\nwretch that stood out against the eternal night like a menace.\n\n\"The wind is strong this summer day, Her petticoat has flown away.\"\n\nShe fell back upon the mattress in a convulsion. They all drew near. She\nwas dead.\n\n\n\nChapter Nine\n\nThere is always after the death of anyone a kind of stupefaction;\nso difficult is it to grasp this advent of nothingness and to resign\nourselves to believe in it. But still, when he saw that she did not\nmove, Charles threw himself upon her, crying--\n\n\"Farewell! farewell!\"\n\nHomais and Canivet dragged him from the room.\n\n\"Restrain yourself!\"\n\n\"Yes.\" said he, struggling, \"I'll be quiet. I'll not do anything. But\nleave me alone. I want to see her. She is my wife!\"\n\nAnd he wept.\n\n\"Cry,\" said the chemist; \"let nature take her course; that will solace\nyou.\"\n\nWeaker than a child, Charles let himself be led downstairs into the\nsitting-room, and Monsieur Homais soon went home. On the Place he\nwas accosted by the blind man, who, having dragged himself as far as\nYonville, in the hope of getting the antiphlogistic pomade, was asking\nevery passer-by where the druggist lived.\n\n\"There now! as if I hadn't got other fish to fry. Well, so much the\nworse; you must come later on.\"\n\nAnd he entered the shop hurriedly.\n\nHe had to write two letters, to prepare a soothing potion for Bovary, to\ninvent some lie that would conceal the poisoning, and work it up into an\narticle for the \"Fanal,\" without counting the people who were waiting to\nget the news from him; and when the Yonvillers had all heard his story\nof the arsenic that she had mistaken for sugar in making a vanilla\ncream. Homais once more returned to Bovary's.\n\nHe found him alone (Monsieur Canivet had left), sitting in an arm-chair\nnear the window, staring with an idiotic look at the flags of the floor.\n\n\"Now,\" said the chemist, \"you ought yourself to fix the hour for the\nceremony.\"\n\n\"Why? What ceremony?\" Then, in a stammering, frightened voice, \"Oh, no!\nnot that. No! I want to see her here.\"\n\nHomais, to keep himself in countenance, took up a water-bottle on the\nwhatnot to water the geraniums.\n\n\"Ah! thanks,\" said Charles; \"you are good.\"\n\nBut he did not finish, choking beneath the crowd of memories that this\naction of the druggist recalled to him.\n\nThen to distract him, Homais thought fit to talk a little horticulture:\nplants wanted humidity. Charles bowed his head in sign of approbation.\n\n\"Besides, the fine days will soon be here again.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Bovary.\n\nThe druggist, at his wit's end, began softly to draw aside the small\nwindow-curtain.\n\n\"Hallo! there's Monsieur Tuvache passing.\"\n\nCharles repeated like a machine---\n\n\"Monsieur Tuvache passing!\"\n\nHomais did not dare to speak to him again about the funeral\narrangements; it was the priest who succeeded in reconciling him to\nthem.\n\nHe shut himself up in his consulting-room, took a pen, and after sobbing\nfor some time, wrote--\n\n\"I wish her to be buried in her wedding-dress, with white shoes, and a\nwreath. Her hair is to be spread out over her shoulders. Three coffins,\none of oak, one of mahogany, one of lead. Let no one say anything to me.\nI shall have strength. Over all there is to be placed a large piece of\ngreen velvet. This is my wish; see that it is done.\"\n\nThe two men were much surprised at Bovary's romantic ideas. The chemist\nat once went to him and said--\n\n\"This velvet seems to me a superfetation. Besides, the expense--\"\n\n\"What's that to you?\" cried Charles. \"Leave me! You did not love her.\nGo!\"\n\nThe priest took him by the arm for a turn in the garden. He discoursed\non the vanity of earthly things. God was very great, was very good: one\nmust submit to his decrees without a murmur; nay, must even thank him.\n\nCharles burst out into blasphemies: \"I hate your God!\"\n\n\"The spirit of rebellion is still upon you,\" sighed the ecclesiastic.\n\nBovary was far away. He was walking with great strides along by the\nwall, near the espalier, and he ground his teeth; he raised to heaven\nlooks of malediction, but not so much as a leaf stirred.\n\nA fine rain was falling: Charles, whose chest was bare, at last began to\nshiver; he went in and sat down in the kitchen.\n\nAt six o'clock a noise like a clatter of old iron was heard on the\nPlace; it was the \"Hirondelle\" coming in, and he remained with his\nforehead against the windowpane, watching all the passengers get\nout, one after the other. Felicite put down a mattress for him in the\ndrawing-room. He threw himself upon it and fell asleep.\n\nAlthough a philosopher, Monsieur Homais respected the dead. So bearing\nno grudge to poor Charles, he came back again in the evening to sit up\nwith the body; bringing with him three volumes and a pocket-book for\ntaking notes.\n\nMonsieur Bournisien was there, and two large candles were burning at the\nhead of the bed, that had been taken out of the alcove. The druggist, on\nwhom the silence weighed, was not long before he began formulating some\nregrets about this \"unfortunate young woman.\" and the priest replied\nthat there was nothing to do now but pray for her.\n\n\"Yet,\" Homais went on, \"one of two things; either she died in a state of\ngrace (as the Church has it), and then she has no need of our prayers;\nor else she departed impertinent (that is, I believe, the ecclesiastical\nexpression), and then--\"\n\nBournisien interrupted him, replying testily that it was none the less\nnecessary to pray.\n\n\"But,\" objected the chemist, \"since God knows all our needs, what can be\nthe good of prayer?\"\n\n\"What!\" cried the ecclesiastic, \"prayer! Why, aren't you a Christian?\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said Homais; \"I admire Christianity. To begin with, it\nenfranchised the slaves, introduced into the world a morality--\"\n\n\"That isn't the question. All the texts-\"\n\n\"Oh! oh! As to texts, look at history; it, is known that all the texts\nhave been falsified by the Jesuits.\"\n\nCharles came in, and advancing towards the bed, slowly drew the\ncurtains.\n\nEmma's head was turned towards her right shoulder, the corner of her\nmouth, which was open, seemed like a black hole at the lower part of her\nface; her two thumbs were bent into the palms of her hands; a kind\nof white dust besprinkled her lashes, and her eyes were beginning to\ndisappear in that viscous pallor that looks like a thin web, as if\nspiders had spun it over. The sheet sunk in from her breast to her\nknees, and then rose at the tips of her toes, and it seemed to Charles\nthat infinite masses, an enormous load, were weighing upon her.\n\nThe church clock struck two. They could hear the loud murmur of the\nriver flowing in the darkness at the foot of the terrace. Monsieur\nBournisien from time to time blew his nose noisily, and Homais' pen was\nscratching over the paper.\n\n\"Come, my good friend,\" he said, \"withdraw; this spectacle is tearing\nyou to pieces.\"\n\nCharles once gone, the chemist and the cure recommenced their\ndiscussions.\n\n\"Read Voltaire,\" said the one, \"read D'Holbach, read the\n'Encyclopaedia'!\"\n\n\"Read the 'Letters of some Portuguese Jews,'\" said the other; \"read 'The\nMeaning of Christianity,' by Nicolas, formerly a magistrate.\"\n\nThey grew warm, they grew red, they both talked at once without\nlistening to each other. Bournisien was scandalized at such audacity;\nHomais marvelled at such stupidity; and they were on the point of\ninsulting one another when Charles suddenly reappeared. A fascination\ndrew him. He was continually coming upstairs.\n\nHe stood opposite her, the better to see her, and he lost himself in a\ncontemplation so deep that it was no longer painful.\n\nHe recalled stories of catalepsy, the marvels of magnetism, and he\nsaid to himself that by willing it with all his force he might perhaps\nsucceed in reviving her. Once he even bent towards he, and cried in a\nlow voice, \"Emma! Emma!\" His strong breathing made the flames of the\ncandles tremble against the wall.\n\nAt daybreak Madame Bovary senior arrived. Charles as he embraced her\nburst into another flood of tears. She tried, as the chemist had done,\nto make some remarks to him on the expenses of the funeral. He became so\nangry that she was silent, and he even commissioned her to go to town at\nonce and buy what was necessary.\n\nCharles remained alone the whole afternoon; they had taken Berthe\nto Madame Homais'; Felicite was in the room upstairs with Madame\nLefrancois.\n\nIn the evening he had some visitors. He rose, pressed their hands,\nunable to speak. Then they sat down near one another, and formed a large\nsemicircle in front of the fire. With lowered faces, and swinging one\nleg crossed over the other knee, they uttered deep sighs at intervals;\neach one was inordinately bored, and yet none would be the first to go.\n\nHomais, when he returned at nine o'clock (for the last two days only\nHomais seemed to have been on the Place), was laden with a stock of\ncamphor, of benzine, and aromatic herbs. He also carried a large jar\nfull of chlorine water, to keep off all miasmata. Just then the servant,\nMadame Lefrancois, and Madame Bovary senior were busy about Emma,\nfinishing dressing her, and they were drawing down the long stiff veil\nthat covered her to her satin shoes.\n\nFelicite was sobbing--\"Ah! my poor mistress! my poor mistress!\"\n\n\"Look at her,\" said the landlady, sighing; \"how pretty she still is!\nNow, couldn't you swear she was going to get up in a minute?\"\n\nThen they bent over her to put on her wreath. They had to raise the head\na little, and a rush of black liquid issued, as if she were vomiting,\nfrom her mouth.\n\n\"Oh, goodness! The dress; take care!\" cried Madame Lefrancois. \"Now,\njust come and help,\" she said to the chemist. \"Perhaps you're afraid?\"\n\n\"I afraid?\" replied he, shrugging his shoulders. \"I dare say! I've seen\nall sorts of things at the hospital when I was studying pharmacy. We\nused to make punch in the dissecting room! Nothingness does not terrify\na philosopher; and, as I often say, I even intend to leave my body to\nthe hospitals, in order, later on, to serve science.\"\n\nThe cure on his arrival inquired how Monsieur Bovary was, and, on\nthe reply of the druggist, went on--\"The blow, you see, is still too\nrecent.\"\n\nThen Homais congratulated him on not being exposed, like other people,\nto the loss of a beloved companion; whence there followed a discussion\non the celibacy of priests.\n\n\"For,\" said the chemist, \"it is unnatural that a man should do without\nwomen! There have been crimes--\"\n\n\"But, good heaven!\" cried the ecclesiastic, \"how do you expect an\nindividual who is married to keep the secrets of the confessional, for\nexample?\"\n\nHomais fell foul of the confessional. Bournisien defended it; he\nenlarged on the acts of restitution that it brought about. He cited\nvarious anecdotes about thieves who had suddenly become honest. Military\nmen on approaching the tribunal of penitence had felt the scales fall\nfrom their eyes. At Fribourg there was a minister--\n\nHis companion was asleep. Then he felt somewhat stifled by the\nover-heavy atmosphere of the room; he opened the window; this awoke the\nchemist.\n\n\"Come, take a pinch of snuff,\" he said to him. \"Take it; it'll relieve\nyou.\"\n\nA continual barking was heard in the distance. \"Do you hear that dog\nhowling?\" said the chemist.\n\n\"They smell the dead,\" replied the priest. \"It's like bees; they leave\ntheir hives on the decease of any person.\"\n\nHomais made no remark upon these prejudices, for he had again dropped\nasleep. Monsieur Bournisien, stronger than he, went on moving his lips\ngently for some time, then insensibly his chin sank down, he let fall\nhis big black boot, and began to snore.\n\nThey sat opposite one another, with protruding stomachs, puffed-up\nfaces, and frowning looks, after so much disagreement uniting at last in\nthe same human weakness, and they moved no more than the corpse by their\nside, that seemed to be sleeping.\n\nCharles coming in did not wake them. It was the last time; he came to\nbid her farewell.\n\nThe aromatic herbs were still smoking, and spirals of bluish vapour\nblended at the window-sash with the fog that was coming in. There were\nfew stars, and the night was warm. The wax of the candles fell in great\ndrops upon the sheets of the bed. Charles watched them burn, tiring his\neyes against the glare of their yellow flame.\n\nThe watering on the satin gown shimmered white as moonlight. Emma was\nlost beneath it; and it seemed to him that, spreading beyond her own\nself, she blended confusedly with everything around her--the silence,\nthe night, the passing wind, the damp odours rising from the ground.\n\nThen suddenly he saw her in the garden at Tostes, on a bench against the\nthorn hedge, or else at Rouen in the streets, on the threshold of their\nhouse, in the yard at Bertaux. He again heard the laughter of the happy\nboys beneath the apple-trees: the room was filled with the perfume\nof her hair; and her dress rustled in his arms with a noise like\nelectricity. The dress was still the same.\n\nFor a long while he thus recalled all his lost joys, her attitudes,\nher movements, the sound of her voice. Upon one fit of despair followed\nanother, and even others, inexhaustible as the waves of an overflowing\nsea.\n\nA terrible curiosity seized him. Slowly, with the tips of his fingers,\npalpitating, he lifted her veil. But he uttered a cry of horror that\nawoke the other two.\n\nThey dragged him down into the sitting-room. Then Felicite came up to\nsay that he wanted some of her hair.\n\n\"Cut some off,\" replied the druggist.\n\nAnd as she did not dare to, he himself stepped forward, scissors in\nhand. He trembled so that he pierced the skin of the temple in several\nplaces. At last, stiffening himself against emotion, Homais gave two\nor three great cuts at random that left white patches amongst that\nbeautiful black hair.\n\nThe chemist and the cure plunged anew into their occupations, not\nwithout sleeping from time to time, of which they accused each other\nreciprocally at each fresh awakening. Then Monsieur Bournisien sprinkled\nthe room with holy water and Homais threw a little chlorine water on the\nfloor.\n\nFelicite had taken care to put on the chest of drawers, for each\nof them, a bottle of brandy, some cheese, and a large roll. And the\ndruggist, who could not hold out any longer, about four in the morning\nsighed--\n\n\"My word! I should like to take some sustenance.\"\n\nThe priest did not need any persuading; he went out to go and say mass,\ncame back, and then they ate and hobnobbed, giggling a little without\nknowing why, stimulated by that vague gaiety that comes upon us after\ntimes of sadness, and at the last glass the priest said to the druggist,\nas he clapped him on the shoulder--\n\n\"We shall end by understanding one another.\"\n\nIn the passage downstairs they met the undertaker's men, who were coming\nin. Then Charles for two hours had to suffer the torture of hearing the\nhammer resound against the wood. Next day they lowered her into her\noak coffin, that was fitted into the other two; but as the bier was\ntoo large, they had to fill up the gaps with the wool of a mattress. At\nlast, when the three lids had been planed down, nailed, soldered, it was\nplaced outside in front of the door; the house was thrown open, and the\npeople of Yonville began to flock round.\n\nOld Rouault arrived, and fainted on the Place when he saw the black\ncloth!\n\n\n\nChapter Ten\n\nHe had only received the chemist's letter thirty-six hours after the\nevent; and, from consideration for his feelings, Homais had so worded it\nthat it was impossible to make out what it was all about.\n\nFirst, the old fellow had fallen as if struck by apoplexy. Next, he\nunderstood that she was not dead, but she might be. At last, he had put\non his blouse, taken his hat, fastened his spurs to his boots, and set\nout at full speed; and the whole of the way old Rouault, panting, was\ntorn by anguish. Once even he was obliged to dismount. He was dizzy; he\nheard voices round about him; he felt himself going mad.\n\nDay broke. He saw three black hens asleep in a tree. He shuddered,\nhorrified at this omen. Then he promised the Holy Virgin three chasubles\nfor the church, and that he would go barefooted from the cemetery at\nBertaux to the chapel of Vassonville.\n\nHe entered Maromme shouting for the people of the inn, burst open the\ndoor with a thrust of his shoulder, made for a sack of oats, emptied a\nbottle of sweet cider into the manger, and again mounted his nag, whose\nfeet struck fire as it dashed along.\n\nHe said to himself that no doubt they would save her; the doctors would\ndiscover some remedy surely. He remembered all the miraculous cures\nhe had been told about. Then she appeared to him dead. She was there;\nbefore his eyes, lying on her back in the middle of the road. He reined\nup, and the hallucination disappeared.\n\nAt Quincampoix, to give himself heart, he drank three cups of coffee\none after the other. He fancied they had made a mistake in the name in\nwriting. He looked for the letter in his pocket, felt it there, but did\nnot dare to open it.\n\nAt last he began to think it was all a joke; someone's spite, the jest\nof some wag; and besides, if she were dead, one would have known it. But\nno! There was nothing extraordinary about the country; the sky was blue,\nthe trees swayed; a flock of sheep passed. He saw the village; he was\nseen coming bending forward upon his horse, belabouring it with great\nblows, the girths dripping with blood.\n\nWhen he had recovered consciousness, he fell, weeping, into Bovary's\narms: \"My girl! Emma! my child! tell me--\"\n\nThe other replied, sobbing, \"I don't know! I don't know! It's a curse!\"\n\nThe druggist separated them. \"These horrible details are useless. I will\ntell this gentleman all about it. Here are the people coming. Dignity!\nCome now! Philosophy!\"\n\nThe poor fellow tried to show himself brave, and repeated several times.\n\"Yes! courage!\"\n\n\"Oh,\" cried the old man, \"so I will have, by God! I'll go along o' her\nto the end!\"\n\nThe bell began tolling. All was ready; they had to start. And seated in\na stall of the choir, side by side, they saw pass and repass in front of\nthem continually the three chanting choristers.\n\nThe serpent-player was blowing with all his might. Monsieur Bournisien,\nin full vestments, was singing in a shrill voice. He bowed before the\ntabernacle, raising his hands, stretched out his arms. Lestiboudois\nwent about the church with his whalebone stick. The bier stood near the\nlectern, between four rows of candles. Charles felt inclined to get up\nand put them out.\n\nYet he tried to stir himself to a feeling of devotion, to throw himself\ninto the hope of a future life in which he should see her again. He\nimagined to himself she had gone on a long journey, far away, for a long\ntime. But when he thought of her lying there, and that all was over,\nthat they would lay her in the earth, he was seized with a fierce,\ngloomy, despairful rage. At times he thought he felt nothing more, and\nhe enjoyed this lull in his pain, whilst at the same time he reproached\nhimself for being a wretch.\n\nThe sharp noise of an iron-ferruled stick was heard on the stones,\nstriking them at irregular intervals. It came from the end of the\nchurch, and stopped short at the lower aisles. A man in a coarse brown\njacket knelt down painfully. It was Hippolyte, the stable-boy at the\n\"Lion d'Or.\" He had put on his new leg.\n\nOne of the choristers went round the nave making a collection, and the\ncoppers chinked one after the other on the silver plate.\n\n\"Oh, make haste! I am in pain!\" cried Bovary, angrily throwing him a\nfive-franc piece. The churchman thanked him with a deep bow.\n\nThey sang, they knelt, they stood up; it was endless! He remembered that\nonce, in the early times, they had been to mass together, and they had\nsat down on the other side, on the right, by the wall. The bell began\nagain. There was a great moving of chairs; the bearers slipped their\nthree staves under the coffin, and everyone left the church.\n\nThen Justin appeared at the door of the shop. He suddenly went in again,\npale, staggering.\n\nPeople were at the windows to see the procession pass. Charles at the\nhead walked erect. He affected a brave air, and saluted with a nod those\nwho, coming out from the lanes or from their doors, stood amidst the\ncrowd.\n\nThe six men, three on either side, walked slowly, panting a little.\nThe priests, the choristers, and the two choirboys recited the De\nprofundis*, and their voices echoed over the fields, rising and falling\nwith their undulations. Sometimes they disappeared in the windings of\nthe path; but the great silver cross rose always before the trees.\n\n     *Psalm CXXX.\n\n\nThe women followed in black cloaks with turned-down hoods; each of them\ncarried in her hands a large lighted candle, and Charles felt himself\ngrowing weaker at this continual repetition of prayers and torches,\nbeneath this oppressive odour of wax and of cassocks. A fresh breeze was\nblowing; the rye and colza were sprouting, little dewdrops trembled at\nthe roadsides and on the hawthorn hedges. All sorts of joyous sounds\nfilled the air; the jolting of a cart rolling afar off in the ruts, the\ncrowing of a cock, repeated again and again, or the gambling of a foal\nrunning away under the apple-trees: The pure sky was fretted with rosy\nclouds; a bluish haze rested upon the cots covered with iris. Charles as\nhe passed recognised each courtyard. He remembered mornings like this,\nwhen, after visiting some patient, he came out from one and returned to\nher.\n\nThe black cloth bestrewn with white beads blew up from time to time,\nlaying bare the coffin. The tired bearers walked more slowly, and it\nadvanced with constant jerks, like a boat that pitches with every wave.\n\nThey reached the cemetery. The men went right down to a place in the\ngrass where a grave was dug. They ranged themselves all round; and while\nthe priest spoke, the red soil thrown up at the sides kept noiselessly\nslipping down at the corners.\n\nThen when the four ropes were arranged the coffin was placed upon them.\nHe watched it descend; it seemed descending for ever. At last a thud was\nheard; the ropes creaked as they were drawn up. Then Bournisien took\nthe spade handed to him by Lestiboudois; with his left hand all the\ntime sprinkling water, with the right he vigorously threw in a large\nspadeful; and the wood of the coffin, struck by the pebbles, gave forth\nthat dread sound that seems to us the reverberation of eternity.\n\nThe ecclesiastic passed the holy water sprinkler to his neighbour. This\nwas Homais. He swung it gravely, then handed it to Charles, who sank to\nhis knees in the earth and threw in handfuls of it, crying, \"Adieu!\" He\nsent her kisses; he dragged himself towards the grave, to engulf himself\nwith her. They led him away, and he soon grew calmer, feeling perhaps,\nlike the others, a vague satisfaction that it was all over.\n\nOld Rouault on his way back began quietly smoking a pipe, which Homais\nin his innermost conscience thought not quite the thing. He also noticed\nthat Monsieur Binet had not been present, and that Tuvache had \"made\noff\" after mass, and that Theodore, the notary's servant wore a blue\ncoat, \"as if one could not have got a black coat, since that is the\ncustom, by Jove!\" And to share his observations with others he went from\ngroup to group. They were deploring Emma's death, especially Lheureux,\nwho had not failed to come to the funeral.\n\n\"Poor little woman! What a trouble for her husband!\"\n\nThe druggist continued, \"Do you know that but for me he would have\ncommitted some fatal attempt upon himself?\"\n\n\"Such a good woman! To think that I saw her only last Saturday in my\nshop.\"\n\n\"I haven't had leisure,\" said Homais, \"to prepare a few words that I\nwould have cast upon her tomb.\"\n\nCharles on getting home undressed, and old Rouault put on his blue\nblouse. It was a new one, and as he had often during the journey wiped\nhis eyes on the sleeves, the dye had stained his face, and the traces of\ntears made lines in the layer of dust that covered it.\n\nMadame Bovary senior was with them. All three were silent. At last the\nold fellow sighed--\n\n\"Do you remember, my friend, that I went to Tostes once when you had\njust lost your first deceased? I consoled you at that time. I thought of\nsomething to say then, but now--\" Then, with a loud groan that shook his\nwhole chest, \"Ah! this is the end for me, do you see! I saw my wife go,\nthen my son, and now to-day it's my daughter.\"\n\nHe wanted to go back at once to Bertaux, saying that he could not sleep\nin this house. He even refused to see his granddaughter.\n\n\"No, no! It would grieve me too much. Only you'll kiss her many times\nfor me. Good-bye! you're a good fellow! And then I shall never forget\nthat,\" he said, slapping his thigh. \"Never fear, you shall always have\nyour turkey.\"\n\nBut when he reached the top of the hill he turned back, as he had turned\nonce before on the road of Saint-Victor when he had parted from her. The\nwindows of the village were all on fire beneath the slanting rays of the\nsun sinking behind the field. He put his hand over his eyes, and saw\nin the horizon an enclosure of walls, where trees here and there formed\nblack clusters between white stones; then he went on his way at a gentle\ntrot, for his nag had gone lame.\n\nDespite their fatigue, Charles and his mother stayed very long that\nevening talking together. They spoke of the days of the past and of the\nfuture. She would come to live at Yonville; she would keep house for\nhim; they would never part again. She was ingenious and caressing,\nrejoicing in her heart at gaining once more an affection that had\nwandered from her for so many years. Midnight struck. The village as\nusual was silent, and Charles, awake, thought always of her.\n\nRodolphe, who, to distract himself, had been rambling about the wood all\nday, was sleeping quietly in his chateau, and Leon, down yonder, always\nslept.\n\nThere was another who at that hour was not asleep.\n\nOn the grave between the pine-trees a child was on his knees weeping,\nand his heart, rent by sobs, was beating in the shadow beneath the load\nof an immense regret, sweeter than the moon and fathomless as the night.\nThe gate suddenly grated. It was Lestiboudois; he came to fetch his\nspade, that he had forgotten. He recognised Justin climbing over the\nwall, and at last knew who was the culprit who stole his potatoes.\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven\n\nThe next day Charles had the child brought back. She asked for her\nmamma. They told her she was away; that she would bring her back some\nplaythings. Berthe spoke of her again several times, then at last\nthought no more of her. The child's gaiety broke Bovary's heart, and he\nhad to bear besides the intolerable consolations of the chemist.\n\nMoney troubles soon began again, Monsieur Lheureux urging on anew his\nfriend Vincart, and Charles pledged himself for exorbitant sums; for he\nwould never consent to let the smallest of the things that had belonged\nto HER be sold. His mother was exasperated with him; he grew even more\nangry than she did. He had altogether changed. She left the house.\n\nThen everyone began \"taking advantage\" of him. Mademoiselle Lempereur\npresented a bill for six months' teaching, although Emma had never taken\na lesson (despite the receipted bill she had shown Bovary); it was an\narrangement between the two women. The man at the circulating library\ndemanded three years' subscriptions; Mere Rollet claimed the postage due\nfor some twenty letters, and when Charles asked for an explanation, she\nhad the delicacy to reply--\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. It was for her business affairs.\"\n\nWith every debt he paid Charles thought he had come to the end of them.\nBut others followed ceaselessly. He sent in accounts for professional\nattendance. He was shown the letters his wife had written. Then he had\nto apologise.\n\nFelicite now wore Madame Bovary's gowns; not all, for he had kept some\nof them, and he went to look at them in her dressing-room, locking\nhimself up there; she was about her height, and often Charles, seeing\nher from behind, was seized with an illusion, and cried out--\n\n\"Oh, stay, stay!\"\n\nBut at Whitsuntide she ran away from Yonville, carried off by Theodore,\nstealing all that was left of the wardrobe.\n\nIt was about this time that the widow Dupuis had the honour to inform\nhim of the \"marriage of Monsieur Leon Dupuis her son, notary at Yvetot,\nto Mademoiselle Leocadie Leboeuf of Bondeville.\" Charles, among the\nother congratulations he sent him, wrote this sentence--\n\n\"How glad my poor wife would have been!\"\n\nOne day when, wandering aimlessly about the house, he had gone up to the\nattic, he felt a pellet of fine paper under his slipper. He opened it\nand read: \"Courage, Emma, courage. I would not bring misery into your\nlife.\" It was Rodolphe's letter, fallen to the ground between the boxes,\nwhere it had remained, and that the wind from the dormer window had just\nblown towards the door. And Charles stood, motionless and staring, in\nthe very same place where, long ago, Emma, in despair, and paler even\nthan he, had thought of dying. At last he discovered a small R at the\nbottom of the second page. What did this mean? He remembered Rodolphe's\nattentions, his sudden, disappearance, his constrained air when they\nhad met two or three times since. But the respectful tone of the letter\ndeceived him.\n\n\"Perhaps they loved one another platonically,\" he said to himself.\n\nBesides, Charles was not of those who go to the bottom of things; he\nshrank from the proofs, and his vague jealousy was lost in the immensity\nof his woe.\n\nEveryone, he thought, must have adored her; all men assuredly must have\ncoveted her. She seemed but the more beautiful to him for this; he\nwas seized with a lasting, furious desire for her, that inflamed his\ndespair, and that was boundless, because it was now unrealisable.\n\nTo please her, as if she were still living, he adopted her\npredilections, her ideas; he bought patent leather boots and took to\nwearing white cravats. He put cosmetics on his moustache, and, like her,\nsigned notes of hand. She corrupted him from beyond the grave.\n\nHe was obliged to sell his silver piece by piece; next he sold the\ndrawing-room furniture. All the rooms were stripped; but the bedroom,\nher own room, remained as before. After his dinner Charles went up\nthere. He pushed the round table in front of the fire, and drew up her\narmchair. He sat down opposite it. A candle burnt in one of the gilt\ncandlesticks. Berthe by his side was painting prints.\n\nHe suffered, poor man, at seeing her so badly dressed, with laceless\nboots, and the arm-holes of her pinafore torn down to the hips; for the\ncharwoman took no care of her. But she was so sweet, so pretty, and her\nlittle head bent forward so gracefully, letting the dear fair hair fall\nover her rosy cheeks, that an infinite joy came upon him, a happiness\nmingled with bitterness, like those ill-made wines that taste of\nresin. He mended her toys, made her puppets from cardboard, or sewed up\nhalf-torn dolls. Then, if his eyes fell upon the workbox, a ribbon lying\nabout, or even a pin left in a crack of the table, he began to dream,\nand looked so sad that she became as sad as he.\n\nNo one now came to see them, for Justin had run away to Rouen, where he\nwas a grocer's assistant, and the druggist's children saw less and less\nof the child, Monsieur Homais not caring, seeing the difference of their\nsocial position, to continue the intimacy.\n\nThe blind man, whom he had not been able to cure with the pomade, had\ngone back to the hill of Bois-Guillaume, where he told the travellers of\nthe vain attempt of the druggist, to such an extent, that Homais when\nhe went to town hid himself behind the curtains of the \"Hirondelle\" to\navoid meeting him. He detested him, and wishing, in the interests of his\nown reputation, to get rid of him at all costs, he directed against\nhim a secret battery, that betrayed the depth of his intellect and the\nbaseness of his vanity. Thus, for six consecutive months, one could read\nin the \"Fanal de Rouen\" editorials such as these--\n\n\"All who bend their steps towards the fertile plains of Picardy have, no\ndoubt, remarked, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a wretch suffering from\na horrible facial wound. He importunes, persecutes one, and levies a\nregular tax on all travellers. Are we still living in the monstrous\ntimes of the Middle Ages, when vagabonds were permitted to display in\nour public places leprosy and scrofulas they had brought back from the\nCrusades?\"\n\nOr--\n\n\"In spite of the laws against vagabondage, the approaches to our great\ntowns continue to be infected by bands of beggars. Some are seen going\nabout alone, and these are not, perhaps, the least dangerous. What are\nour ediles about?\"\n\nThen Homais invented anecdotes--\n\n\"Yesterday, by the Bois-Guillaume hill, a skittish horse--\" And then\nfollowed the story of an accident caused by the presence of the blind\nman.\n\nHe managed so well that the fellow was locked up. But he was released.\nHe began again, and Homais began again. It was a struggle. Homais won\nit, for his foe was condemned to life-long confinement in an asylum.\n\nThis success emboldened him, and henceforth there was no longer a dog\nrun over, a barn burnt down, a woman beaten in the parish, of which\nhe did not immediately inform the public, guided always by the love of\nprogress and the hate of priests. He instituted comparisons between the\nelementary and clerical schools to the detriment of the latter; called\nto mind the massacre of St. Bartholomew a propos of a grant of one\nhundred francs to the church, and denounced abuses, aired new views.\nThat was his phrase. Homais was digging and delving; he was becoming\ndangerous.\n\nHowever, he was stifling in the narrow limits of journalism, and soon a\nbook, a work was necessary to him. Then he composed \"General Statistics\nof the Canton of Yonville, followed by Climatological Remarks.\" The\nstatistics drove him to philosophy. He busied himself with great\nquestions: the social problem, moralisation of the poorer classes,\npisciculture, caoutchouc, railways, etc. He even began to blush at being\na bourgeois. He affected the artistic style, he smoked. He bought two\nchic Pompadour statuettes to adorn his drawing-room.\n\nHe by no means gave up his shop. On the contrary, he kept well abreast\nof new discoveries. He followed the great movement of chocolates; he\nwas the first to introduce \"cocoa\" and \"revalenta\" into the\nSeine-Inferieure. He was enthusiastic about the hydro-electric\nPulvermacher chains; he wore one himself, and when at night he took off\nhis flannel vest, Madame Homais stood quite dazzled before the golden\nspiral beneath which he was hidden, and felt her ardour redouble for\nthis man more bandaged than a Scythian, and splendid as one of the Magi.\n\nHe had fine ideas about Emma's tomb. First he proposed a broken column\nwith some drapery, next a pyramid, then a Temple of Vesta, a sort of\nrotunda, or else a \"mass of ruins.\" And in all his plans Homais always\nstuck to the weeping willow, which he looked upon as the indispensable\nsymbol of sorrow.\n\nCharles and he made a journey to Rouen together to look at some tombs\nat a funeral furnisher's, accompanied by an artist, one Vaufrylard, a\nfriend of Bridoux's, who made puns all the time. At last, after having\nexamined some hundred designs, having ordered an estimate and made\nanother journey to Rouen, Charles decided in favour of a mausoleum,\nwhich on the two principal sides was to have a \"spirit bearing an\nextinguished torch.\"\n\nAs to the inscription, Homais could think of nothing so fine as Sta\nviator*, and he got no further; he racked his brain, he constantly\nrepeated Sta viator. At last he hit upon Amabilen conjugem calcas**,\nwhich was adopted.\n\n     * Rest traveler.\n\n     ** Tread upon a loving wife.\n\nA strange thing was that Bovary, while continually thinking of Emma, was\nforgetting her. He grew desperate as he felt this image fading from his\nmemory in spite of all efforts to retain it. Yet every night he dreamt\nof her; it was always the same dream. He drew near her, but when he was\nabout to clasp her she fell into decay in his arms.\n\nFor a week he was seen going to church in the evening. Monsieur\nBournisien even paid him two or three visits, then gave him up.\nMoreover, the old fellow was growing intolerant, fanatic, said Homais.\nHe thundered against the spirit of the age, and never failed, every\nother week, in his sermon, to recount the death agony of Voltaire, who\ndied devouring his excrements, as everyone knows.\n\nIn spite of the economy with which Bovary lived, he was far from being\nable to pay off his old debts. Lheureux refused to renew any more\nbills. A distraint became imminent. Then he appealed to his mother, who\nconsented to let him take a mortgage on her property, but with a great\nmany recriminations against Emma; and in return for her sacrifice she\nasked for a shawl that had escaped the depredations of Felicite. Charles\nrefused to give it her; they quarrelled.\n\nShe made the first overtures of reconciliation by offering to have the\nlittle girl, who could help her in the house, to live with her. Charles\nconsented to this, but when the time for parting came, all his courage\nfailed him. Then there was a final, complete rupture.\n\nAs his affections vanished, he clung more closely to the love of his\nchild. She made him anxious, however, for she coughed sometimes, and had\nred spots on her cheeks.\n\nOpposite his house, flourishing and merry, was the family of the\nchemist, with whom everything was prospering. Napoleon helped him in the\nlaboratory, Athalie embroidered him a skullcap, Irma cut out rounds of\npaper to cover the preserves, and Franklin recited Pythagoras' table in\na breath. He was the happiest of fathers, the most fortunate of men.\n\nNot so! A secret ambition devoured him. Homais hankered after the cross\nof the Legion of Honour. He had plenty of claims to it.\n\n\"First, having at the time of the cholera distinguished myself by a\nboundless devotion; second, by having published, at my expense,\nvarious works of public utility, such as\" (and he recalled his pamphlet\nentitled, \"Cider, its manufacture and effects,\" besides observation\non the lanigerous plant-louse, sent to the Academy; his volume of\nstatistics, and down to his pharmaceutical thesis); \"without counting\nthat I am a member of several learned societies\" (he was member of a\nsingle one).\n\n\"In short!\" he cried, making a pirouette, \"if it were only for\ndistinguishing myself at fires!\"\n\nThen Homais inclined towards the Government. He secretly did the\nprefect great service during the elections. He sold himself--in a word,\nprostituted himself. He even addressed a petition to the sovereign\nin which he implored him to \"do him justice\"; he called him \"our good\nking,\" and compared him to Henri IV.\n\nAnd every morning the druggist rushed for the paper to see if his\nnomination were in it. It was never there. At last, unable to bear it\nany longer, he had a grass plot in his garden designed to represent the\nStar of the Cross of Honour with two little strips of grass running from\nthe top to imitate the ribband. He walked round it with folded arms,\nmeditating on the folly of the Government and the ingratitude of men.\n\nFrom respect, or from a sort of sensuality that made him carry on his\ninvestigations slowly, Charles had not yet opened the secret drawer of\na rosewood desk which Emma had generally used. One day, however, he\nsat down before it, turned the key, and pressed the spring. All Leon's\nletters were there. There could be no doubt this time. He devoured them\nto the very last, ransacked every corner, all the furniture, all the\ndrawers, behind the walls, sobbing, crying aloud, distraught, mad. He\nfound a box and broke it open with a kick. Rodolphe's portrait flew full\nin his face in the midst of the overturned love-letters.\n\nPeople wondered at his despondency. He never went out, saw no one,\nrefused even to visit his patients. Then they said \"he shut himself up\nto drink.\"\n\nSometimes, however, some curious person climbed on to the garden hedge,\nand saw with amazement this long-bearded, shabbily clothed, wild man,\nwho wept aloud as he walked up and down.\n\nIn the evening in summer he took his little girl with him and led her to\nthe cemetery. They came back at nightfall, when the only light left in\nthe Place was that in Binet's window.\n\nThe voluptuousness of his grief was, however, incomplete, for he had no\none near him to share it, and he paid visits to Madame Lefrancois to be\nable to speak of her.\n\nBut the landlady only listened with half an ear, having troubles\nlike himself. For Lheureux had at last established the \"Favorites du\nCommerce,\" and Hivert, who enjoyed a great reputation for doing errands,\ninsisted on a rise of wages, and was threatening to go over \"to the\nopposition shop.\"\n\nOne day when he had gone to the market at Argueil to sell his horse--his\nlast resource--he met Rodolphe.\n\nThey both turned pale when they caught sight of one another. Rodolphe,\nwho had only sent his card, first stammered some apologies, then grew\nbolder, and even pushed his assurance (it was in the month of August and\nvery hot) to the length of inviting him to have a bottle of beer at the\npublic-house.\n\nLeaning on the table opposite him, he chewed his cigar as he talked, and\nCharles was lost in reverie at this face that she had loved. He seemed\nto see again something of her in it. It was a marvel to him. He would\nhave liked to have been this man.\n\nThe other went on talking agriculture, cattle, pasturage, filling out\nwith banal phrases all the gaps where an allusion might slip in. Charles\nwas not listening to him; Rodolphe noticed it, and he followed the\nsuccession of memories that crossed his face. This gradually grew\nredder; the nostrils throbbed fast, the lips quivered. There was at\nlast a moment when Charles, full of a sombre fury, fixed his eyes on\nRodolphe, who, in something of fear, stopped talking. But soon the same\nlook of weary lassitude came back to his face.\n\n\"I don't blame you,\" he said.\n\nRodolphe was dumb. And Charles, his head in his hands, went on in a\nbroken voice, and with the resigned accent of infinite sorrow--\n\n\"No, I don't blame you now.\"\n\nHe even added a fine phrase, the only one he ever made--\n\n\"It is the fault of fatality!\"\n\nRodolphe, who had managed the fatality, thought the remark very offhand\nfrom a man in his position, comic even, and a little mean.\n\nThe next day Charles went to sit down on the seat in the arbour. Rays\nof light were straying through the trellis, the vine leaves threw their\nshadows on the sand, the jasmines perfumed the air, the heavens were\nblue, Spanish flies buzzed round the lilies in bloom, and Charles was\nsuffocating like a youth beneath the vague love influences that filled\nhis aching heart.\n\nAt seven o'clock little Berthe, who had not seen him all the afternoon,\nwent to fetch him to dinner.\n\nHis head was thrown back against the wall, his eyes closed, his mouth\nopen, and in his hand was a long tress of black hair.\n\n\"Come along, papa,\" she said.\n\nAnd thinking he wanted to play; she pushed him gently. He fell to the\nground. He was dead.\n\nThirty-six hours after, at the druggist's request, Monsieur Canivet came\nthither. He made a post-mortem and found nothing.\n\nWhen everything had been sold, twelve francs seventy-five centimes\nremained, that served to pay for Mademoiselle Bovary's going to\nher grandmother. The good woman died the same year; old Rouault was\nparalysed, and it was an aunt who took charge of her. She is poor, and\nsends her to a cotton-factory to earn a living.\n\nSince Bovary's death three doctors have followed one another at Yonville\nwithout any success, so severely did Homais attack them. He has an\nenormous practice; the authorities treat him with consideration, and\npublic opinion protects him.\n\nHe has just received the cross of the Legion of Honour.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Madame Bovary, by Gustave Flaubert\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MADAME BOVARY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2413.txt or 2413.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/4\/1\/2413\/\n\nProduced by An Anonymous Volunteer, Noah Adams and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":440,"split":"train"}
