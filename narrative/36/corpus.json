She proves to be Dariel, the daughter of Sur Imar, a prince of the Lesghians, a wild tribe of the Caucasus. A blood feud has arisen between Imar and his sister, and so he has, with his daughter, his foster-brother Stepan, and a body of retainers, come to England and settled peaceably in a deserted house in Surrey.\nImar resolves to returns to his native land to educate his tribesmen in the lessons of civilisation. George, who has fallen in love with Dariel, follows her to the East. But Imar's twin-sister Marva, Queen of the Ossets, who is appropriately called by the natives \"the Bride of the Devil,\" plans to kill Prince Imar and wed his daughter Dariel to her son. After weeks of travelling and days full of desperate adventure, George, with the help of miners and Lesghians, rescues Dariel and her father and kills the wicked Princess and her fiendish son.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Dariel, by R.

For every one knows how to\ndo a thing, much better than the one who does it.\n\nIn spite of all that, I will declare in a truthful manner unabashed,\nwhatever I know concerning the strange affairs which have befallen me;\nand perhaps if you care to look into them, you will admit that even now,\nwhen the world supposes itself to be in a state of proud civilization,\nthere are things to be found near its centre of perfection which are not\nquite up to the standard of the Lord.\n\nTowards the middle of the month of May, in a year which I never shall\nforget, I happened to be riding home from Guildford in the county of\nSurrey, after a long but vain attempt to do a little business for my\nfather. For we were not, as we used to be, people of wealth and large\nestates, and such as the world looks up to; but sadly reduced, and\ncrippled, and hard-pushed to make a living. And the burden of this task\nhad fallen most heavily upon me, because I was the only son at home, and\nmy father's mind was much too large to be cramped with petty troubles.\nSo that when he had been deprived of nine-tenths of his property, and\ncould not procure any tenants for the rest, it became my duty to work\nthe best of the land that still remained, and make both ends meet, if\npossible.\n\nTo a young man this was no great hardship unless he were spoiled for\ncountry life by ambition, or sloth, or luxury; and it seemed to me at\nfirst a welcome change, to be recalled from Oxford and from Lincoln's\nInn, and set to watch the earth and sky, instead of ink and paper. And\nalthough there were storms and swamps of loss and disaster, to cross\ncontinually, I was always at the point of getting on, if only there came\njust a little turn of luck. But that which seemed to baffle mainly my\nmost choice endeavours, was that when I had done good work, and made\ngood staple--as it seemed to me--never a man to whom I showed it (at the\nmost reasonable figure) would stop to look at it for a moment in a\nreasonable spirit; because, whatever I had to offer was, by strange\ncoincidence, the very thing my fellow-creatures happened not to want\njust then.\n\nWhat had I done, this very day, but carried into Guildford market, more\nthan twelve miles from our home, samples of as fair, and fat, and\nthoroughly solid grain, as ever was grown to be ground in England? And\nwhat had the dealers said to me? \"Tut, tut! what call you that? Not so\nbad for an amateur. Try again, sir, try again. Sir Harold must grow it\ncheaper.\" And they made me not a single offer, such as I could think of\ntwice; while the farmers looked askance, and smiled very kindly and\nrespectfully, yet as if I had no business there, and must soon discover\nmy sad mistake.\n\n\"Never mind what they think,\" I exclaimed to myself, \"or how they laugh\nat all I can do. Wait a bit, wait a bit, my friends. We are not come to\nthe bottom of the basket yet. Hold up, ancient Joseph.\"\n\nAncient Joseph was the only horse now remaining with us, who could get\nalong at all, without a plough or waggon at his heels or tail. Like us,\nhe had seen better days; and like us he did not dwell upon them.\nFaithful, generous, and conscientious, he kept up to his own standard\nstill, and insisted upon his twelve miles an hour, whenever his head was\nhomeward. It was in that pleasant direction now; and much as I longed\nfor a gentle glide of the soft May breeze around me, and a leisurely\ngaze at the love of the year, now telling its tale in the valleys, that\nold fellow (sniffing his oats leagues away) cared for nothing but a\nquick stroke towards them. Much as I wanted to think about the money\nthat I ought to have got, but couldn't, this horse between my legs was\nso full of what he meant to be filled with, that I was compelled to\nattend to his mood, instead of giving rein to my own; lest haply a ditch\nshould be our conclusion.\n\nWithout any heed we scoured past the loveliest views in England, as\npeople in a train are forced to do; till Old Joe's wind became a gale,\nmore adverse now than favourable. His four legs, which had been going\nlike two, began to go like a figure of four, and he gave me to\nunderstand through the flaps of leather, that his heart was repentant of\nhaving its own way. On the ridge of the hills at the four cross-roads, I\nallowed him therefore a welcome rest, having the worst of the road\nbefore us, and the shadows growing deeper.\n\nPerhaps I had prided myself too much upon seldom indulging in whims and\nfreaks, as my elder brother Harold did, to his great disadvantage and\nour own; and now at the age of twenty-five, I should have known better\nthan to begin. But some strange impulse (which changed the whole course\nof my life from that hour) seized me, as I stopped to breathe my horse\nopposite that old direction-post.\n\n\"To Cobham and Esher\" was on the left arm; the forward one pointed to a\nvillage near our home, and that was the road I had always taken. But the\narm that would have pointed to the right, if it had been in its duty,\nwas not there now, though a double mortice-hole gave token of its late\nexistence. And the lane towards the right, of which it should have told\nus, seemed rather desirous of evading notice, and certainly had received\nvery little for years from any road-surveyor. Narrow, and overhung, and\nsinking into sleepy shadows with a fringe of old roots and dead bracken,\nit afforded a pleasant sense of passing into quietude and loneliness.\n\nTime was more plentiful than money with me, and why should I hurry to\ntell my father the old tale of failure, so often repeated, but none the\nmore welcome--as an old joke is--by reason of familiarity? I knew the\nchief outlines of the country pretty well, because an old fox had been\nfond of it, whom we never brought to book, when the hounds were kept at\nCrogate Park. How he had beaten us we never knew, beyond having fifty\nopinions about it, of which only two were in favour with the wise\nones--the first that he sank into the bowels of the earth, and the other\nthat he vanished into the clouds of heaven. And the place was lonely\nenough for him to have taken whichever course he chose, leaving nothing\nbut negative evidence.\n\nKnowing that if I could cross that valley I should probably strike into\na bridle-lane which would take me home at leisure, I turned my old\nhorse, much against his liking, into this dark and downhill course, away\nfrom the main road, which according to the wisdom of our forefathers\nfollowed the backbone of the ridge. Soon we began to descend steep\nplaces broken with slippery falls of rock, while branches of thicket and\nsapling trees shook hands overhead, and shut out the sky. My horse, who\nhad never been down on his knees, and knew perhaps by instinct the\nresult of that attitude in the eyes of men, was beginning to tremble\nexceedingly; and in fairness to him and myself as well, I jumped off and\nled him. He looked at me gratefully, and followed without fear, though\nsometimes sliding with all four feet, and throwing back his head for\nbalance. And perhaps he observed, as soon as I did, that no horse had\never tried that descent, since the rains of winter washed it.\n\nWhen I was ready to think myself a fool, and wish both of us well out of\nit, the sweetest and clearest note, that ever turned the air into melody\nand the dull world into poetry, came through the arching bowers of\nspring, and made the crisp leaves tremulous. Then as a bud, with its\npoint released, breaks into a fountain of flower, the silvery overture\nbroke into a myriad petals of sensitive song.\n\n\"What a stunning nightingale,\" said I, as a matter-of-fact young Briton\nmight, with never an inkling of idea that the bird meant anything to me.\nBut he seemed to be one of those that love mankind (as the genial\nrobin-redbreast does), or at any rate desire to be thought of kindly,\nand to finish well what is well begun; for he flitted before me down\nthe hill, and enlivened the gloom with vicissitudes of love.\n\nListening to this little fellow, and trying to catch sight of him, I was\nstanding with Old Joe's nose in my hand--for he was always\nfriendly--when the music that should lead my life, in the purest strain\ncame through the air. It was not the voice of a bird this time, but a\nsound that made my heart beat fast and then held me in rapture of\nwonder.\n\nDew of the morning in a moss-rose bud, crystal drops beading a frond of\nfern, lustre of a fountain in full moonlight--none of these seem to me\nfit to compare with the limpid beauty of that voice. And more than the\nsweetest sounds can do, that indite of things beyond us, and fall from a\nsphere where no man dwells, this voice came home to my heart, and filled\nit with a vivid sorrow and a vague delight.\n\nSturdy as I was, and robust, and hardy, and apt to laugh at all\nsentimental stuff, the force of the time overcame me, as if I had never\nbeen educated; and as soon as I rather felt than knew that I was\nlistening to some simple hymn, I became almost as a little child\ninhaling his first ideas of God. The words that fell upon my ears so\nsoftly were as unknown as the tune itself, voice and verse and air\ncombining into a harmony of heaven.\n\nOught any man to be called a snob, for doing a thing that is below\nhimself, on the impulse of the moment, and without a halt of thought? It\nis not for me to argue that; but I hope that fair ladies will forgive\nme, when I confess that I stepped very gently, avoiding every dry twig\nand stone, across the brown hollow that is generally found at the foot\nof any steep fall of wood. By this time the lane was gone to grass, and\nI slipped Old Joe's bit that he might have a graze, while I went in\nquest of my Siren.\n\nOn the further brink of the spongy trough, a dark frizzle of alder and\nclose brushwood was overhanging a bright swift stream, which I\nrecognised as the Pebblebourne, a copious brook, beloved of trout, and\nas yet little harassed by anglers. Through this dark screen I peered,\nand beheld a vision that amazed me. Along a fair meadow that bent\ntowards the west, and offered a slim tree here and there--like a\nwalking-stick for evening--the gentle light of day's departure came\nquite horizontally. There was, as there often is in nature, some deep\npeace of sadness, which rebukes mankind for its petty cares, and\nperpetual fuss about itself. And yet there was something in front of all\nthis, to set the heart of a young man fluttering.\n\nOn the opposite bank, and within fair distance for the eyes to make out\neverything, was a niche of dark wall shagged with ivy, and still\nsupporting the grey stonework of a ruined chapel-window, between whose\njagged mullions flowed the silvery light of the west and fell upon the\nface of a kneeling maiden. The profile, as perfect as that of a statue,\nyet with the tender curves of youth, more like the softness of a cameo,\nwas outlined as in a frame of light against the black curtain of the\nivied wall. Beside the kneeling figure lay a head-tire of some strange\ndesign, removed perhaps when the hymn was followed by the attitude of\nprayer.\n\nThe beauty and rapture of this devotion made me hold my breath, and feel\nas if I were profaning it. \"Get away, you low intruder,\" said my better\nself to me. But it is all very well to talk. It was out of my power to\ngo away. Under this spell I stood, until that gentle worshipper arose\nwith a bend of her graceful neck, and gathered her pale grey robe around\nher. It was not such a dress as English ladies according to the fashion\nof the moment wear, with pumpkin sleeves, or with wens upon their\nshoulders, and puckers, and gathers, and frizzles and scollops, in a\nmangle of angles and zig-zags. What it was made of is more than I can\nsay; I only know that it was beautiful; drawn in at the waist with a\nnarrow belt, and following rather than trying to lead the harmony of the\nliving form. But one thing caught my attention even so, and that was the\nflash of a bright red cross on the delicate curve of the bosom.\n\nIt appeared to me that tears were sparkling under the fringe of large\ndark eyes, as the lonely maiden glanced around, while preparing for\ndeparture. Then to my surprise--if anything could surprise me\nfurther--with a rapid movement she laid bare a gleaming shoulder, and\nset upon it the tip of a long straight finger. Her face was partly\nobscured to me by the bend of her arm, but I fancied that she smiled,\nand was opening her lips to pronounce some words, when suddenly that\nhorse Old Joe, who had been doing his best to lessen the burden of his\nmaintenance, gave vent to a snort of approbation, not of the fair sight\nacross the water--for that was hidden by bushes from him--but at the\njuiciness of his graze. My guilty conscience made me start, for I fully\nexpected to be found out in a thing I had never done before; and I felt\nashamed to look again, till I knew there was no suspicion. Then a breath\nof wind turned up a leaf; and who could help glancing under it?\n\nI saw that the beautiful and mysterious damsel had taken some little\nalarm at the grunt of the greedy quadruped. From the foot of the old\nchapel-window she was taking something white like a crucifix--though I\ncould not be certain about that; meanwhile she had placed on her head\nthat strange affair which I had seen lying on the ground. To me it\nlooked like an octagonal hat, with a long veil of gauze descending from\nit, resembling nothing that I had ever seen on a lady's head, to the\nbest of my remembrance; although in bright fact they wear such strange\nthings, and trim them anew so wondrously, that no man must be positive.\nWhatever it was, it looked very sweet--as the ladies themselves express\nit--but I grieved that I could see her face no more.\n\nShe placed that white object very carefully in the folds of her dress\nbeneath the veil which covered her down to the waist; and then to my\ngreat disappointment she was gone, seeming rather to float on the air\nthan to walk with a definite stride, as our ladies make their way. But\nthe quivering points of some pendulous leafage showed that a bodily form\nhad passed there.\n\nI was left in a conflict of wonder, and doubt, and intense desire to\nknow more, mingled with some self-reproach--though the worst of that\ncame afterwards--and a hollow feeling in my heart as if I should never\nfill it with myself again. Something told me that the proper course, and\nthe most manly and business-like, was to jump on my horse and make him\nclimb the hill anew, and take the high road, and get home at full speed,\nand never say a word about what I had seen, nor even think about it, if\nit could be helped.\n\nBut I assure you (and I hope again that allowance will be made for me,\nas a young man not much accustomed to the world, and hitherto heedless\nof feminine charms) that I found it impossible to do the right thing\nnow. Instead of a lofty and resolute withdrawal, in I went for more of\nthat, of which I had taken too much already. I stuck Old Joe's bit into\nthe hungry leather of his most voracious mouth, and came down on his\nback with a ponderous swing, and girded him with a hard grip of his\nbelly, to show me some more of what he had scared away. Much against his\nliking--for if ever a horse was totally destitute of romance, here he\nwas and no mistake--with a grunt of remonstrance he plodded into the\npebbly ford at the bottom of the hill.\n\nBut when we struck into the silence of the meadow, what was I the wiser?\nLo, the dusk was settling down in the most indifferent manner, the\nsunset flush was fading into a faint and chill neutrality, the trees had\nno shadow, and, worst of all, no sign or even memory of any sweet\npassage among them. Only on the left hand some hundred yards away was a\nblack door set in an old grey wall, which curved along leisurely as far\nas I could see, and offered no other entrance.\n\n\"I am not the sort of fellow to put up with this,\" I exclaimed to myself\nimpatiently; and yet there was no way to help it just now. And if it\ncame to reason, what business had I there? Still the whole of this land\nhad been ours not more than a century ago, and a true Briton feels that\nhe has his rights, however long he may have lost them. But it is not in\nhis nature to lose sight of reason, though I am not quite so certain how\nthat was with me, as I wandered home slowly along forgotten ways, and\nknew that my life was changed thenceforth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE FAMILY\n\n\nIt is said, and seems worthy of belief--though denied quite lately by a\ngreat Frenchman--that there are in the world no fairer damsels than\nthose of our own dear island. Graceful, elegant, straight and goodly,\ngentle--which is the first point of all--yet lively and able to take\ntheir own part, eager moreover to please, and clever to obtain what they\nwant by doing so, they have no cause to envy their brothers, or feel\nungrateful to Providence for making them fair. If any of them do that\nsometimes, when led astray every now and then by feminine agitators, for\nthe most part they will come back to themselves, if left without\ncontradiction.\n\nMy sister Grace, for instance, was one of the best and kindest-hearted\nEnglish girls that ever blushed. Far in front of me, I confess, in\nquickness of apprehension, and perception of character, and readiness of\nanswer, and I might almost say in common-sense; though I never quite\nconceded that, because I had so much need of it. Nevertheless she looked\nup to me, as her elder by five years, and a man. Therefore, it was my\ncustom always to listen with much toleration to her, and often adopt her\nviews in practice, after shaking my head for the time at them. For she\nalways finished her orations with, \"Well, brother George, you are sure\nto know the best.\"\n\nNow, if we had none but Grace to deal with, things would have been very\ndifferent. Not that we could have retrieved our fortunes--of that there\nwas no possibility; still, we might have carried on in our humble way,\nand kept my father, Sir Harold Cranleigh, comfortable in his old age,\nand even happy among his books and collection of minerals, and seals and\ncoins. My mother also might have had all she could wish; for she was in\ntruth a very quiet soul, bound up in her children, and fond of little\nelse, unless it were county histories, and the fulfilment of prophecy.\nSometimes she was grieved that we occupied now the old cottage in a\ncorner of the Park, which had once been the house of our agent; also at\nhaving but a pony-cart, instead of what she was accustomed to. But the\ngrief was not on her own account, and simply for our sake, as we knew\nwell; and we kept on telling her that we liked it better so.\n\nFor after all, if one comes to think, those very wealthy folk have no\ntrue enjoyment, and no keen relish for anything good. In the first\nplace, they can never feel the satisfaction of having earned, by honest\nwork, their pleasure. It comes to them but as an everyday matter,\nwearisome, vapid, insipid, and dull. Many of them have a noble spirit,\nand that makes it all the worse for them. They see and they feel the\nmisery of the poverty around them, but all they can do is of no avail.\nThey are cheated and wronged in their best endeavours; if they show\ndiscernment, they are called niggards; if they are profuse, it is\nostentation. And if they are large enough not to be soured by any of\nthese expressions, they begin to feel more and more, as time goes on,\nthat the money should stop in the family.\n\nRemembering this, we should have regarded with delicate compassion that\nvery wealthy individual, Mr. Jackson Stoneman. This eminent stockbroker\nclaimed not only our sympathy for his vast riches, but also some\ngoodwill by the relief afforded us in a cumbrous difficulty. My father\nhad long been casting about, as matters went from bad to worse, and farm\nafter farm was thrown up by insolvent tenants, for some one to occupy\nour old house, Crogate Hall, and the Park as well, for he could not bear\nto let them separately, and have the old place cut into patches. But\nthere was no one left among the old families of the county, still\npossessing cash enough to add this to the homes already on their hands.\nThere is much fine feeling and warmth of heart toward one another,\namong those who have never had much to do, from one generation to\nanother, except to encourage the good people who love order, by\npunishing those of an opposite turn, and to keep up the line which has\nalways been drawn between landed estate and commerce; as well as to be\nheartily kind to the poor--even though they do encroach a little on\npreserves--and above all to be hospitable not to one another only, but\nto people of business who know their position.\n\nOur family, one of the oldest in Surrey, and of Saxon lineage, requiring\nno mixed Norman blood of outsea cutthroats to better it, had always kept\nits proper place, and been beloved for its justice, generosity, and\nmodesty. Our tenants had never made any pretension to own the lands they\nheld of us, any more than a man to whom I had lent a thousand pounds at\ninterest--supposing that I owned such a sum--would set up a claim to my\ncapital. We were very kind to them as long as they could pay; and\nthroughout their long struggle with the foreign deluge, we made every\neffort to keep them afloat, reducing their rent to the vanishing point,\nand plunging with them into poverty. But what can be done, when the best\nland in England will not pay for working, and is burdened as heavily as\never?\n\n\"Cut your coat according to your cloth,\" is a very fine old precept; and\nwe went on doing so, as Heaven only knows. But when there is no cloth\nleft at all, and the climate is not good enough to supply fig-leaves,\nwherewithal shall a man be clothed? And for a woman, how much\nworse--though they sometimes exaggerate their trials. My sister Grace\nwas as lovely a maiden as ever was born of Saxon race, which at its best\nis the fairest of all. To my mind she was far more beautiful than her\nsister Elfrida, the eldest of us, now the wife of Lord Fitzragon, who\nhad children of her own, and very seldom came to see us, being taken up\nwith her own world. And one of the things that grieved me most was to\nsee my favourite sister dressed in some common blue serge, with a brown\nleather belt round her waist, and thick shoes on her delicate feet, like\na boy elected by Twickenham parish to the Blue-coat School. For a boy it\nis all very well, and may lead to the highest honours of the realm; but\nwith a maiden of gentle breed it is not so encouraging.\n\nNotwithstanding this, I say that you might put a lady of any rank you\nplease, and of any wealth to back it up, by the side of my sister Grace;\nand I know to which of them your eyes would turn. The Lord may see fit,\nfor some good purpose, to set one of His children high and to pluck down\nanother; but He never undoes what He did at the first, and His goodness\nremains in the trouble. Many girls lowered from their proper line of\nlife, and obliged to do things that seemed hard for them, would have\nturned sour, and tossed their heads, or at the very least would have\ntaken unkindly to what they were forced to do. And if anybody blamed\nthem for it, the chances are that it would be some one who would have\ndone the very same. But to see our Grace now, you would have thought\nthat she had been born a small yeoman's daughter, or apprenticed quite\nyoung to a dairyman. What I mean is--unless you looked at her twice; and\nto fail of doing that would be quite sufficient proof that you care not\nfor the most interesting thing in all human nature--except perhaps a\nloving mother--to wit, a gentle, truthful, lively, sweet, and\naffectionate young maid.\n\nIt is not in a man to be so good, and luckily it is not expected of him.\nCertainly I did speak strongly sometimes, and find fault with the luck,\nand the world, and the law, and above all with the Government, which\nevery Englishman has a right to do. At such times my sister would\nscarcely say a word,--which alone is enough to prove her\nself-command,--but draw down her golden hair between her fingers, and\nlook at me softly from her deep blue eyes, and clearly be trying to\nthink as I thought. When any one whose opinion is at all worth having\ndoes that sort of thing, almost any man is pleased with the silence he\nhas created; and his temper improves, as he approves of himself. And so\nI always felt with Grace, that she might be right, because I was right;\nand it helped me more than any one might think, to know that my words\nmade a stronger impression on another mind than they left upon my own.\n\nHappy beyond all chance of fortune would be the man who could win such a\nheart, and be looked at with even deeper love than a sister has for a\nbrother, and feel himself lifted more nigh to heaven than he had any\npower, or perhaps even any desire of his own to go. But no man so gifted\nhad appeared as yet, neither did we want him to turn up, for the very\ngood reason that Grace Cranleigh was the heart and soul of our little\nhousehold, just as I, George, was the hand and head, for all practical\npurposes, though much against my liking.\n\nBecause my elder brother Harold, heir to the title and the dwindled\nheritage, was the proper person to come forward, and take the lead of\nour forlorn hope, and stand up bravely in the gap, and encourage the\nelders when thus stricken down and impoverished. But as I have hinted\nbefore, we had a trouble almost as bad as mortgages, loss of invested\nmoney, and even the ruinous price of corn, and that was a Genius in the\nfamily, without any cash to support him. Truly in almost every family\nthe seeds of genius may be found, but most of them are nipped in early\ndays, or start in some harmless direction. But Harold's was not to be\ncured like this, for it started in every direction, with a force that\nleft nothing to be desired, except the completion of something. There\nwas no conceit in this brother of mine, neither any defect of energy. No\nmatter what he took up, not only was he full of it for the time, but\nperfectly certain that nothing of equal grandeur had dawned upon the\nhuman race till now. Time would fail me to begin the list of his\nmanifold inventions, for every one was greater than the one before it,\nand in justice to him I should have to go through all. While there were\ndifficulties in the way, his perseverance was boundless. But the moment\nhe had vanquished them, and proved that there was little more to do, as\nsure as eggs are eggs he would stop short, exclaim, \"Oh, any fool can do\nthat!\" and turn his great powers to something even greater.\n\nWe all admired him, as no one could help doing, for he was a wonderfully\ntaking fellow, gentle, handsome, generous, and upright, a lover of\nShakespeare, a very fine scholar, as tender to animals as if he knew\ntheir thoughts, and in every way a gentleman, though not fond of\nsociety. But the worst of it was that we had to pay for him; and this\nwas uncommonly hard to do, under our present circumstances. For\ninventors must have the very best material, as well as the finest tools\nfor their work, and some one of skill to hold things in their place, and\nto bear the whole blame when the job miscarries. We were grieved, when\ninstead of the untold gold which was to have set us staggering, a\nbasketful of bills was all that came, with headings that sent us to the\nCyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia, and footings that spelled the workhouse.\n\n\"What is all this about letting the old house?\" Harold had asked me,\nwithout indignation, but still with some sadness at our want of faith,\nthe very last time I had seen him. \"You have so very little foresight,\nGeorge! You forget altogether how easy it is to let a man in; but to get\nhim out again, there's the rub; and how often the landlord is forced to\ntake the roof off!\"\n\n\"The rub has been to get him in, this time,\" I answered in my dry\nsubmissive way, for I never tried to reason with such a clever fellow.\n\"The doors are scarcely large enough for a man of such substance. And as\nfor the roof, it was taking itself off, after three years without any\nrepairs, and no one to ask where the leaks were. I think it is a\nwonderful piece of luck that Mr. Jackson Stoneman, a man of\nextraordinary wealth, has taken such a fancy to the poor old place. It\nwas Grace who showed him round, for there was no one else to do it. And\nshe says that although he may not be quite accustomed----\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't wish to hear any more about him. I detest the idea of\nletting our old house, and the Park, and the stables, I suppose he wants\nthem all. And just when I am at the very point of securing a patent,\nwhich must restore us to our proper position in the county; for the\nmodel is as good as finished. No lease, no lease, my dear George. If you\nlet him in, have a binding agreement to get him out at any time, with\nthree months' notice. And when you speak of roofing, have you quite\nforgotten that I have discovered a material which must supersede all our\nbarbarous plans for keeping the sun and the rain out?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I remember. You mean to let them in,\" I replied, without any\nattempt at sarcasm, but having a vague recollection of something.\n\n\"Undoubtedly I do, to a certain extent; and then to utilise them. Every\ngreat idea must be in accordance with nature, instead of repelling her.\nNow the sun and the rain--but just give me that sheet of paper, and in\ntwo minutes you will see it all. It is the most simple and beautiful\nidea. All I fear is that some one else may hit upon it. But, George, I\ncan trust you, because you are so slow.\"\n\nWith pencil and compass he was sure to be happy for an hour or more and\ncome beaming to dinner; so I left him, and went to tell my father that\nhis eldest son, whose consent he required, had given it to that most\nnecessary step, the letting of Crogate Hall and Park to some eligible\ntenant. Not only was a very great burden removed,--for we could not bear\nto see the old place lapse into ruin,--but also a welcome addition was\nmade to our very scanty income. For the great stockbroker paid a\nhandsome rent without any demur, and began for his own sake to put\neverything into good order. Once more the windows shone with light\ninstead of being grimed with dust and fog; and the Park was mown, and\nthe deer replaced, and the broad expanse of lawn was gay with cricket\ncolours and the pretty ways of women.\n\nBut we in our corner kept ourselves at a distance from such enjoyment.\nNot through any false pride, or jealousy of a condition which had once\nbeen ours; but simply because, as my father said, and my mother agreed\nwith him warmly, it had never been the habit of our family to receive\nentertainment which it could not return. Our home-made bread was (for\nrelish and for nurture) worth fifty of their snowy Vienna stuff, and a\npint of the ale which I brewed myself was better than a dozen of their\ndry champagne, or a vintage of their Chateau this and that. But they\nwould never think so; and if Englishmen choose to run down their own\nblessings, as they do their merits, let the fashion prevail, while the\nfew who can judge for themselves hold fast their convictions.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTOM ERRICKER\n\n\nMr. Jackson Stoneman was--so far as I could make him out, without having\nhad six words with him--a very clever City-man, yet keeping two sides to\nhis life, as he could well afford to do. At an early age he had come\ninto the chief control of a long-established firm, one of those that\nventure little, but keep on rolling from age to age the ball of\naccumulating gold. This globe of all human delight was not at all likely\nto slip between such legs as his; though the wicked metal will do that\nsometimes, and roll away down the great hill of despair. He attended\nvery strictly to the main chance of all humanity, the object for which\nwe were born and die. That of course ruled his existence; but the people\nwho met him outside the covert, or rode with him when the scent was hot,\ndeclared that he was a most excellent fellow, ready at an answer,\nintelligent of hounds, skilful of hand and full of pluck, neither\nshowing off nor shirking work, and as courteous to a farmer as to the\nLord-Lieutenant.\n\nThis was high praise for a man of his position. And we found before long\nthat every one confirmed it. He took a large farm off our hands which\nhad long been begging anybody to take it; and though his solicitor was\nkeen enough to grind down the rent to the lowest figure, and insist upon\nmany new conditions, we could not blame his principal for that, and were\nwell aware that landlords nowadays must be grateful to any who will\npatronise them. In fact, we had no other grievance against him, except\nthat he was rich and we were poor; and I am sure that we were not so\nnarrow-minded as to feel any grudge on that account. My mother\nespecially--as behoved one of the most charitable of women--found many\ngood excuses for a practice of his, which some might have taken as a\nproof of want of taste. Our cottage was beside the direct road from the\nHall to the nearest railway station, for no line had cut up our\nneighbourhood as yet. Every morning, at least except on Saturday and\nSunday, when we were sitting down to breakfast, a rattle of wheels and\nclank of silver harness would explain itself into Mr. Jackson Stoneman,\nsitting bolt-upright with a cigar in his mouth, and flourishing a long\ntandem-whip, while a couple of glittering chestnuts whirled him along\nthe smooth road, and a groom in white buckskins and top-boots\naccordingly sat behind, and folded his arms in contempt of the world.\nGrace like a child, though she was dignity itself when any stranger\nlooked at her, used to run to the window and exclaim, \"Oh, what loves of\nhorses! How everything shines, and how well he drives!\"\n\n\"Who couldn't drive a team of circus horses?\" was the first thing I\nsaid, but she took no notice. And the next morning, when the thing came\njingling by, and she stopped my sugar to stare at it--\"Perhaps you long\nto be upon that spare cushion,\" I remarked; for what man can put up with\nhis sister's nonsense? And after that, she never knew when the brilliant\ntandem passed, which made me feel a little ashamed of myself.\n\nHowever, I will not blame the great stockbroker--\"Stocks-and-Stones\" was\nthe name I gave him, without meaning harm, but the nickname spread, and\ngave him some trifling annoyance, I fear--what right has any man to\nblame another for a little bit of thoughtlessness, redressed at first\nperception? Somebody told Stoneman, or perhaps he found it out, for\nnothing escaped him, that I was displeased at his flashing by like that,\nnot on my own account, as scarcely need be said; and the next week he\ntook another road to the station, half a mile longer and much worse for\nhis horses. And so we lost sight of his handsome turn-out, to which we\nwere getting accustomed and began to set our time-piece by it.\n\nAll these things are small; but what is truly great, unless it be\nconcerned with love, or valour, freedom, piety, or self-denial, and\ndesire to benefit the world at large? And yet, as a rule, we care most\nabout those who dwell little upon such big matters, but carry on\npleasantly, and suit us, and amuse us, and seem to be rather below than\nabove us, in mind, and ambition, and standard of life. Tom Erricker\nknows that he is of that class, and I am welcome to say what I like of\nhim, without any danger to our friendship. And if I describe him exactly\nas he is, he will take the better part as a compliment, and tell me that\nthe rest is of my imagination.\n\nAs he came to and fro from his chambers in the Temple, my friend Tom was\na very bright young fellow, indolent yet restless, perpetually in love,\nthough his loves were of brief continuity, light of heart, impulsive,\nvery eager to oblige, and gifted with a very high opinion of himself,\nand a profound scorn of everything that he could not understand. He was\ngenerous, bold, and adventurous, a keen judge of character according to\nhis own idea, yet a thorough hero-worshipper, very fond of addressing\nhimself in the mirror, and trying to give an impartial account of his\nown appearance and qualities.\n\n\"Well, Tom, my boy,\" I heard him say one day, for he was confidential to\nothers, as well as to himself, about himself, \"you are not looking quite\nthe thing this morning. A few cigars less, Tom, would suit you better.\nAnd little crow's-feet already coming! What business have they there at\nfive-and-twenty? It can't be reading too hard, or you would have got\nthrough, last time. Never mind, Tom, you are not a bad-looking fellow,\nthough you mustn't suppose you are handsome. There is not enough of you;\nthat's the great fault,--not enough of you to look dignified.\"\n\nIn all this he was perfectly correct, though he might have supposed\nhimself handsome without any very great partiality; for his eyes were of\na rich and lively brown, such as many a maiden might have envied. And\nhis features quite regular enough, and short, and full of genial\nvivacity. He was right enough also in the observation that there was not\nenough of him to enforce the impression which such wisdom as his should\ncreate; for although not by any means a dwarf, he was of less than\naverage stature, while exceedingly active and very well built. But he\nnever said a truer thing in the purest of all self-commune, than that\nhis crow's-feet, if any there were, could not have owed their origin to\nexcess of mental labour. Such is the sort of man one likes; because he\ncan never put one right, when a plague of accuracy comes on.\n\nNow what was my inducement, who shall say? And the reasons come too late\nto make much difference, when a man has done a very foolish thing. It\nmay have been partly because I had never kept any secret back from Tom,\nafter my long time at school and college with him, and I did not like to\ndo so now; and it may have been also that I felt uneasy about my own\nbehaviour, and longed for some encouragement. Be that as it will, when\nTom Erricker came down, as he never failed to do at least once every\nmonth, to spend Saturday and Sunday with us, no sooner had I got him in\nmy little den at the back of our cottage where the harness was kept,\nthan I bundled old Croaker, our only stableman, away to his dinner, and\nwith proper introductions poured forth to my friend the whole narrative\nof that strange affair which I had witnessed as above, but spoken of as\nyet to no one.\n\nMy friend's interjections and frequent questions need not be set down,\nfor he was of the many who can never hear a story without interruption.\nBut when I had assured him for the fiftieth time that there was nothing\nmore to tell, his face, which had been a fine study of amazement, became\nequally full of oracular wisdom.\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" he said; \"leave it to me, George. I will soon get to\nthe bottom of it. I never speak rashly. You know what I am. There is\nsomething very deep behind all this. You, who live so near, and are only\nacquainted with country ways, must not move in the matter. I shall find\nthe key to it. You can do nothing. I get about among people so much; and\nI know nearly all that goes on in Soho. You have never done a wiser\nthing than to keep this dark and consult me about it. And a wonderfully\nlovely girl, you say!\"\n\n\"Dark let it be if you please,\" I answered; though I had never even\nthought about that before, for I do detest all mystery. \"Erricker, I\ntold you this in confidence. It looks as if I was wrong in doing even\nthat, when you begin talking in that sort of way. Is it likely that I\nwould let you take it up? If I cannot myself, as a gentleman, pry into a\nthing I was not meant to see, do you suppose I would let a young\nfellow\"--Tom was my junior by about three months--\"a young fellow like\nyou meddle with it?\"\n\n\"Now don't be in a huff, George;\" he spoke with a smile, as if I were\nmaking a fuss about nothing. \"I have far more important things than this\nto think of. It was only for your sake that I said a word. But I always\ntry to be straightforward. Why did I go down in the last exam? They\nasked me to describe a contingent remainder; and I said it was a\nremainder that was contingent. Could anything be more correct than that?\nAnd yet the infernal old Q. C. said that I must pursue my studies. And\nnow, if I don't get through next time, the glorious tinman will cut\nshort my allowance. But, thank God, I have got a maiden aunt.\"\n\nThe glorious tinman was Tom's worthy father, the head of a great plating\nfirm at Sheffield. Being perpetually involved in law-suits concerning\ntrade-marks and patents, and finding silver and gold enough for a\nmonth's heavy plating sink into the long robe, this gentleman had said\nto his wife, \"Why not keep it in the family?\" And she had replied, \"Oh,\nhow clever our Tom is! None of those councillors understand the trade.\"\nTherefore was Tom at the Temple now.\n\nWhen my friend once began upon his own affairs, and the ignorance of his\nexaminers, he was ready to go on for ever; and so I cut him short with\nthe question which had chiefly induced me to unburden my mind to him.\n\n\"The point is this, my dear boy. Ought I to feel ashamed, do you feel\nashamed of me, for acting the spy upon a young lady who had no idea I\nwas looking at her? Speak plainly, I won't be offended.\"\n\n\"If I ever get through, I am sure to be a judge,\" Tom Erricker replied,\nwith a glance of deprecation at his rather \"loud\" suit of red-and-white\nplaid \"Dittoes;\" \"my aunt Gertrude has said so fifty times; and I feel\nthe making of it in me, though it takes a long time in development. And\nI sum up the merits thus, George Cranleigh. You had no right to begin;\nbut when you had begun, I am blowed if I can see how you could help\ngoing on. And I should like to go on a lot further with it.\"\n\nMy mind (which was larger then than now, for nothing loses more by wear\nand tear) was relieved, much more than it would be now by even some\nvalid pronouncement.\n\n\"Tom Erricker, you are a brick,\" I said; \"and I don't mind showing you\nthe place. There is plenty of time before dinner yet. Only you must give\nme your word of honour--not a syllable about it to any one.\"\n\n\"Hands up. That's what we say in our corps,\"--for he was a member of the\n\"Devil's Own,\" and a very zealous one, for such a lazy fellow,--\"but I\ncould not walk so far without a gun.\"\n\nThis difficulty did not last long; for I ran to the door, and asked my\nsister to lend her pony Amabel to my friend Tom for an hour or two.\nGrace was the most obliging girl that was ever too good to be married,\nand although she felt some kind disdain, as it seemed to me sometimes,\nfor Tom, her pony was heartily at his service, if he would promise not\nto whip her. Tom came out of our little hole, when this stipulation\nreached his ears, and he put on his hat for the pleasure and glory of\ntaking it off again to my sister. Among his many tendernesses, the\nsweetest and biggest of all perhaps was one with our Grace at the end of\nit. But he knew, as we know such things by instinct, that she never\nwould come in to share it; and though he fetched many a sigh, they were\nshallow, because hope had never been beneath them.\n\nOff we set in the summer afternoon, for the month was come to June\nalready, with everything going on as if we were nothing. Because I have\nnot said much about it,--as behoves an average young Englishman,--if\nanybody reads this, he may think that nothing to dwell upon had come\nhome to me, by reason of what I had seen that day when the millers made\nlight of my samples. But this I can declare, and would have done so long\nago except for some sense that it was my affair alone, the whole world\nhad been quite a different thing to me, ever since I set eyes\nupon--well, there is but one to any man worth anything; and does he ever\nget her?\n\nTom Erricker was the last fellow in the world to whom one could offer\nany fine gush of feeling; because he was sadly sentimental sometimes,\nwhen his veins of thought were varicose, and when something nasty had\nhappened to himself; but when his spirits were up, you would think there\nhad never been a tear shed in the world, except by some brat who knew\nnot how to cut his teeth. He was now in great exaltation at having\nfetched me, as he thought, to his level; for I had always regarded his\nlight flirtations with a pleasant turn of humour, and he could not see\nthe difference between himself and me. So I rode Old Joseph, who was a\ngood tall horse; and he on little Amabel looked up at me, with no more\nreverence than Sancho Panza showed to the immortal knight, who ever\nfailed to elevate him.\n\n\"Give me an open country, not your slash and scratch-pins.\" There was\nnothing Tom loved more than talking as if he had followed hounds from\nhis infancy, instead of growing up under a dish-cover; but romancing on\nsuch subjects would not go down with me.\n\n\"Surely you might have brought us by a better road than this, George. I\nhave had my bad times, I don't mind them in a burst; but I'm blessed if\nI like being scratched to pieces, with nothing whatever to show for it.\"\n\n\"To talk about, you mean, Tom. Well, here we get out into as pretty a\nbit of firland as can be found even in Surrey; and that may challenge\nall England to equal it. But I never go in for the picturesque.\"\n\n\"To be sure, not. The ladies do it ever so much better. To own the land,\nor at any rate the shooting, is the chief thing for us to care about.\nAnd the shooting is worth twice as much as the crops, in the present\ncondition of the market. Never mind, George, I won't talk about that,\nfor I know it is a very sore subject. Do you mean to say that all this\nbelonged to you, not more than fifty years ago?\"\n\n\"Out of the frying-pan into the fire, as regards the subject,\" I\nanswered with a smile, for I knew that he never meant to vex me. \"But I\nam sorry that we cannot give you leave even to poke about here with your\ngun, and pot blackbirds and magpies. There go two magpies! You don't\noften get so near them.\"\n\n\"Two for a wedding--don't they say? A good omen for you, George. But\nwhere the deuce does your nymph hang out? Aha! good hit of mine! A nymph\nmeans a bride, doesn't she, in Greek?\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" I said, for this talk was very paltry, and perhaps Tom\nErricker's appearance was not quite up to the mark of a romantic moment.\nMy chief desire was to gaze across the valley, down the further side of\nwhich, about a mile away, I could trace pretty clearly by its fringe of\nbushes the windings of the brook which I had crossed that day on my\nreturn from Guildford. It seemed to be ages ago, whereas it was only\nfour weeks; but I had thought about it enough to make a very broad space\nof time. And here was Tom chaffing, and eager to make fun, with his red\nplaid trousers forced up to his knees by his jerking about in the\nsaddle, and his loftiest air of acquaintance with the world, and his\nlargest smiles of superiority to women. For the moment I longed to\ndeposit him in an ant-hill.\n\n\"Well, what can I see? Or what am I to look for?\" He spoke as if he had\npaid me for a view and I was bound to make it worth the money. Whereas,\nthough I did ask his opinion at a distance, it was the last thing I\nshould think of now; and in plain truth, what business had he here at\nall, and spying about through a shilling eyeglass? But it was not for me\nto take things as he did. Let him long to enter into them.\n\n\"All right,\" I said. \"We will come another day. This may or it may not\nbe the place. Look at your poor legs. They are fat enough; but what a\nsight for a lady! What a fool you were, not to take my straps!\"\n\n\"Bless the fellow! Well, you are hard hit, or you would not carry on in\nthis style.\" Tom turned his eyeglass upon me in a manner which might\nhave provoked me, if I had been capable of thinking twice about him now.\n\"In a blue study, George? Everything looks blue, even the mist in the\nvalley. Has she got blue eyes? Ah! there is nothing like them.\"\n\n\"Blue eyes have no depth. What do you know about eyes?\" I spoke with\nsome warmth, as was natural. And then, just to show him how calmly I\ntook his childish and shallow observation, I proceeded as if he had\nnever spoken.\n\n\"You see that long mass of black ivy to the right, cutting a sort of\njag, or perhaps it is a great curve out of the flat steep line of the\nmeadow?\"\n\n\"Yes, to be sure I do. Nothing could be plainer. A jag which is a curve\nat the same time; and a flat meadow which is also steep!\"\n\n\"Never mind the meadow. You are not so stupid that you can't see the\nwall, and the ivy on it. Now, Tom Erricker, what do you suppose that to\nbe?\"\n\n\"How can I tell, about two miles away? Let us go on, and make it out,\nold chap.\"\n\n\"Not another step. I am not at all sure that I ought to have brought you\nso far as this. However, you can hold your tongue, I know; and you are\nupon your honour about all this. Well, that is the wall of an old\nmonastery, more than five hundred years old, I believe, and connected\nwith that ancient chapel on the hills. Naturally, it is all in ruins\nnow, and there has been an attempt to set a mill up in its place.\"\n\n\"The best thing to be done with it,\" Tom replied, for his nature was not\nreverent. \"But a mill should have paid, if it had any water. Free trade\nhas not had time to destroy the pounders yet, although it has killed the\nproducers. But I don't want to hear about monks and mills. The lovely\nnuns are more to my taste.\"\n\n\"What nuns could there be in a monastery, Tom? You are even more abroad\nthan usual. But though I have not been near the place, since the time I\ntold you of, and we have nothing to do with that valley now, I have put\na few quiet questions here and there, and I find that the old place has\nbeen sold to a foreign gentleman, whose name our fine fellows cannot\npronounce.\"\n\n\"Oho! That becomes very interesting. He's papa of the beautiful nymph,\nno doubt. But you never mean to say that you left off there?\"\n\n\"Certainly I do. How could I go prying? What Englishman would ever think\nof meddling with his neighbours? And a foreigner, too, who has come here\nfor quiet----\"\n\n\"Bother!\" replied Tom. \"If they have lovely daughters, everybody has a\nright to find out all about them. I'll bet you a hat it is some wicked\nold conspirator, a Nihilist perhaps, or at least an Anarchist, taking\nadvantage of our stupid hospitality, to hatch some fiendish plot, and\nblow up some foreign monarch, with whom we pretend to be in strict\nfriendship. Why, only a few months ago----\"\n\n\"No more of that. I hoped to have found a little common-sense in you. As\nif it were possible that that--that perfect----\"\n\n\"Angel!\" cried Tom. \"You can't get beyond that. And I am blessed if I\never could have believed that a sensible, slow-going bloke like you,\nGeorge----\"\n\nI took hold of his bridle, and turned Amabel homeward, and gave her such\na sharp little flick behind that my friend had as much as he could do to\nkeep in the saddle, for the best part of the way back to our cottage.\nFor we never grudged oats to our horses.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nMR. STONEMAN\n\n\nNo man who has to contend with the world, and support those he loves\nagainst it, cares twopence about being taken for a fool by the people he\nhas to contend with. Their opinion to this effect frequently is of some\nservice to him, and very seldom hurts him, unless he wants to get into\ntheir employment, or to borrow money from them. And in the latter point\nit even helps him, when he has good security to give.\n\nThere is a certain worm, whose name I know not, being all abroad in\nnatural history, whose habit it is to come out of the ground and give\nhimself an airing late at night. And then if you moisten him from above,\nin September or October, so grateful is he--or, if you deny him that\nlofty feeling, so sensitive--that he glitters like any glow-worm.\n\nWith no less amplitude, perhaps, a man who has deep emotions, such as\nshy ambition, or literary yearnings, or passionate humanity, or true\nlove of a woman, sometimes lets himself out at night, when small things\nare lost to the eyes, and the larger objects begin to assert themselves.\nFor after all, what are the toys of the day, for which we sweat, and\nfight, and crawl, and rack our poor brains till they cry for the\nrevolver--even if we get such gauds, what are they, to make up for the\ngentle delight we have lost, of the days when we loved all the world,\nand the moments when some one tried to do the like to us?\n\nNow nothing of this kind comes in here, for verily I had been cheated\ntoo often to rush into the embrace of the universe. But for the life of\nme, I cannot tell how to explain the behaviour of a man, keener by a\nthousandfold, and harder than in my worst moments I could long to be,\nexcept by such principles, or (if they are not that) such want of\nprinciple, such backsliding, such loosening of texture, and relapse into\nnature, as we feel even in ourselves sometimes, and are more ashamed of\nthem in voice than heart. However, let every one judge for himself.\n\nIt must have been close upon St. Swithin's Day, for people were watching\nthe weather as they do, to keep up the fine old legend, when after a\nlong turn among the hay, which was very late that year, I sat in my\nlittle den after dark, considering my pipe, or perhaps allowing it to\nconsider for me, because I was tired with a hard day's work, and fit for\nnothing but putting my legs up. While we were so busy with the only\nthing worth growing now in England, because it grows itself, the wisest\nplan was to dine, or at least to feed, among it, and be content. And to\nfeed upon it is what the true Briton must come to, whenever a great war\narises. The man who has shut his eyes, must also shut his mouth, as the\nproverb hath it.\n\nWhile I was nodding at every puff, and full of the sleepy scent of hay,\nthe sound of a step, and the darkening of my open doorway, aroused me.\n\"Come in, Bob,\" I said, \"anything the matter?\" For some of our ricks had\nbeen carried rather green, and we were still obliged to watch them.\n\n\"Excuse me for taking you thus by surprise. If you can spare me a few\nminutes, Mr. Cranleigh, you will do a great favour. It is Jackson\nStoneman.\"\n\nHaving seen this rich gentleman chiefly at a distance, and not cared\nmuch to look at him, I wondered at his coming in upon me thus, and was\nrather inclined to resent it. But the thought of my father and mother,\nand of the great help that his tenancy was to them, compelled me to drop\nsuch little points, and receive him with all civility. My snuggery was\nbut a very little place, forming a part of the harness-room, and\nresigned (whenever the door was shut) to a very modest share of daylight\ncoming through leaded diamonds, which were certainly not brilliants. So\nI lit my candles, still having a pair, and offered him my one armchair,\nan ancient Windsor, with a cushion in the bottom, more cosy than most of\nthe easy-chairs made now to be gazed at rather than sat upon. He thanked\nme, but took his seat upon an oaken bench, and looked at me steadily, as\nif to search my humour. Being of an equable and by no means rapid\ntemper, I returned his gaze with interest, and left him to begin.\n\n\"First of all, I must have this settled,\"--his voice was very clear and\nrather pleasant, though he showed some signs of nervousness; \"it must be\nunderstood that whether I am right or wrong in coming to you like this,\nyou will not be annoyed, and turn against me.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" I said, for the promise was a light one. What harm could I\ndo to a man of his wealth? And if a man offends me, I let him alone,\nuntil it is cowardice to do so.\n\n\"You attach much importance, I think, Mr. Cranleigh, to questions of\nbirth, and position in the county, and ancient family, and so on?\"\n\n\"I am not at all aware that I do so. The fact is, that I am too busy now\nto dwell much upon such things. And their period seems to be over.\"\n\nI knew that I was talking stuff, and that bitterness made me do it. One\nglance from his swift eyes showed me that he thought none the more of me\nfor taking such a tone, although for the moment it was genuine.\n\n\"If you make little of such matters, I do not,\" said Stoneman; \"neither\nwill any one of common-sense, for many generations yet to come. At least\nif those who are born to such advantage have the wisdom not to overdo\nit. But I want to put a few plain questions to you; and from what I have\nheard and seen of you, I am sure that you will answer them plainly, when\nyou know that they are not impertinent. And I give you my word that they\nare not that.\"\n\n\"Anything you please, to the best of my knowledge, of anything a\nstranger has a right to know.\"\n\n\"I am not a stranger altogether; though I have no privilege of\nfriendship. When I tell you what I have come about, you may think that\nI should have gone to your father first. But I thought it better to give\nyou the chance of saving him from annoyance. In almost every way, you\nact as the manager now for the family. Am I right in believing that?\"\n\n\"Yes, as regards all local business. My brother, Harold, would be the\nproper man; but he is seldom here, and he is not fond of\nbusiness--business of a small kind, I mean of course.\"\n\nMy visitor smiled, as if he doubted that ever there could be any but\nsmall business here; and remembering what we must have been once, I\nregarded him rather sternly. He was tall, and strongly built, and\nstraight, and plainly dressed, as a man should be, leaving beauty to the\nbeautiful. Not that he was an unsightly fellow, but very good-looking in\na certain way. His forehead was large and square, and gave the idea of\nstrength and steadfastness, and his eyes, perhaps too deeply set, but\nfull of vigour and decision. His complexion was dark for an\nEnglishman's, and his close-cropped hair as black as jet, and so was his\nshort moustache, the only growth allowed upon his face. A good clear\ncountenance upon the whole, without any sign of weakness in it, neither\nof more hardness than a man of the world requires, to hold his own and\nenlarge it.\n\nHe saw that I was \"taking stock\" of him,--as his own phrase might have\nbeen perhaps,--and he waited the result with confidence. Then he put me\nto some little confusion.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Cranleigh, I hope that some of your prejudices are not\nconfirmed. I know that my position here is not very likely to produce\ngoodwill, especially with young men of high spirit. But I will not go\ninto that question now, beyond asking you this as a favour. Have I done\nanything, since I occupied the Hall, that a stranger should not have\ndone among--among the real owners?\"\n\n\"Not that I know of. I may say more than that. I may say that you have\nshown us in every way very kind consideration.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I have tried to do so in everything round here. But now as\nto taking the hounds, I have given no promise, until I knew your\nopinion. Would it annoy Sir Harold, or any of your family?\"\n\n\"Not in the least; especially after you have been so kind as to ask us.\nThey have long left our hands, as you know. My grandfather kept them on,\nlong after he could afford it; but my father never cared for them, and\ngave it up as soon as possible. As for my brother, he would have nothing\nto do with them, if he were made of money. And my liking matters of\ncourse neither way.\"\n\n\"That seems hard when you do all the work. You mean, I suppose, that you\nwould like to keep them under different circumstances.\"\n\n\"If I were head of the family, and could afford it handsomely. As it is,\nI would not, even if I could afford it. I should seem to be putting\nmyself too forward.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. And shall not I appear to be putting myself too forward, if\nI bring them back to the old place, just because I can afford it? Your\ncandid opinion about that.\"\n\n\"Then I think not. No one could take it amiss but ourselves; and we are\nnot so small as that.\"\n\n\"Not even the ladies? Sometimes ladies do not see things quite as we do.\nThey might take it into their heads--I mean, they might think, not\nunreasonably, that I was of the upstart order.\"\n\n\"There is very little fear of that,\" I said; \"in our family the ladies\nare never difficult to deal with. They have always been consulted, and\ntherefore they are shy about forming their opinions. It is not as if\nthey had no weight, as among the less solid Norman race. They know that\nwhat they say is something; and that makes them like to hear our\nopinions first.\"\n\n\"That state of things is most interesting, as well as rather unusual.\"\nMr. Stoneman spoke with a smile of calm inquiry, entirely free from\nirony, and evidently wished me to go on. But I did not see how it\nconcerned a stranger; so I left him to his own affairs.\n\n\"He seems a very decent sort of fellow. But if he has come to pump me,\"\nthought I, \"he will find that the water has gone from the sucker.\" And\nhe saw that he could not pursue that subject.\n\n\"I have lately received a requisition, or whatever is the proper name\nfor it, from several of the people about here, whose acquaintance I made\nlast season, that I should take over the old Crogate hounds, as Lord\nWiedeland has resigned them. It was signed by yourself and your brother\nHarold. That made me think more about it. It seems rather absurd for a\nbusy man like me, who could never be out more than twice a-week, and\nvery seldom as much as that. And I am not such a fool as to care two\nraps about random popularity; but I want to do what I ought to do; and I\nwill, whenever I know it.\"\n\n\"Then I think that you ought to do this,\" I answered, seeing that he was\nin earnest. \"You ride very well, you enjoy it thoroughly, and you know\nquite enough about it to keep things in good order. There is not a man\nin the neighbourhood who dares take any liberties with you. Joe Stevens,\nof course, will come over with the pack. He is a host in himself. The\nkennels are as good as they ever were. And perhaps the hounds will\nrecognise their duty to their ancestors, who lived so happily in the old\nplace.\"\n\n\"Ah, there you touch me up; although I am sure that you never meant it.\nAnd that brings me to my second point. If I undertake this affair, upon\nthe distinct conditions which I shall make, will you join me, and be in\neffect the real master, although my name is used? You are here always, I\nam generally away. Everybody knows and values you. I am a mere\ninterloper. If you would only help me thus, everything would go\nbeautifully.\"\n\nNot being very quick of thought, which is upon the whole a benefit,\nwhile on the other hand I am uncommonly fond of hunting, I was not far\nfrom saying yes, when luckily my pipe went out. With that I arose to get\nanother, and as I stood by the mantelpiece a clearer waft of mind came\nto me, and showed me the many objections.\n\n\"Your offer is wonderfully kind and tempting, and shows more confidence\nin me than I have earned.\" I spoke with some emotion, because I felt\nthat last point strongly, having shown no friendship towards this man.\n\"But I cannot accept it, Mr. Stoneman. I will do all I can to make\nthings easy, and to help you to the utmost of my power. But my first\nduty is to my father and mother. And I could not do this without\nneglecting that.\"\n\n\"You are right. I was wrong in proposing it. My stable, of course, would\nhave been at your service. But the inroads upon your time, and the many\nderangements--well, never mind, so long as you are not angry with me for\nproposing it. But if you will come out with us now and then----\"\n\n\"Certainly I will, upon our Old Joseph. He ran away with me not very\nlong ago. Some of your young cracks would find him not so very far\nbehind; for he is wonderfully knowing.\"\n\n\"Good for you, I know how that tells up; though I am not a 'Parson\nJack,' who laid \u00c2\u00a35 that he would be in at the death upon his old donkey,\nand won it. Very well, all that is settled--not exactly as I should\nwish, but as much as we ever get things. But the next thing I shall\nnever get. And it is the only thing in life I care for.\"\n\n\"I should have thought that a man like you, resolute, very clear-headed,\nand wealthy, might make sure of everything that in reason he required.\nWith life and health, I mean, of course, and the will of the Lord not\nagainst him.\"\n\n\"We never know what is the will of the Lord, until we console ourselves\nwith it. Not that I am a scoffer or even a sceptic, Mr. Cranleigh. And\nin some of the greatest moments of my life--but I will not bother you\nwith them. Only I may say that I look upon this as the very greatest of\nthem all. I don't want to make a fool of myself--but--perhaps the Lord\nhas done it for me.\"\n\nHe tried to make a little smile of this, and looked as if he wanted me\nto help him out. But I could only stare, and wonder whether any man ever\nborn is at all times right in his head. For if anybody could be expected\nto know what he is about at all times, I should have thought that man\nwould be Jackson Stoneman of the Stock Exchange. So I waited, as my\nmanner is, for him to make good sense of this.\n\nThen he got up from his bench and set his face (which had been\nquivering) as firm as the Funds, and looked down at me--for I was in my\nWindsor chair again--and his eyes seemed to flash defiance at me,\nalthough his voice was tender.\n\n\"George Cranleigh, you may think what you like. I care not a rap what\nanybody thinks. I love your sister Grace, as no man ever loved a woman,\nor ever will.\"\n\nMy amazement was so great and sudden that I looked at him without a\nword. For a moment I was beaten out of time by this strong man's\nintensity.\n\n\"I know all the stuff that you will say,\" he went on with scanty\npoliteness. \"That I have not seen her more than half-a-dozen times. That\nI have no right to lift my eyes to her. That even a mint of money can\nnever make up for the want of birth. That I am nothing but an upstart.\nThat I may be a rogue for all you know. That she is a million times too\ngood, and pure, and beautiful for such a fellow. Go on, go on; I would\nrather have it over.\"\n\n\"But I have not begun yet, and you give me no time,\" I answered very\nsteadily, having now recovered myself, and objecting to have my\narguments forestalled. \"You seem to forget yourself, Mr. Stoneman. There\nis no necessity for excitement. That a man of the world like you----\"\n\n\"That is the very point. That's what makes my chance so bad. There is\nnothing of romance or sweet sentiment about me. I don't know anything\nabout hearts and darts. I have no poetical ideas. I could not fling\nmyself off a rock--if there was one. I don't know how to couch a lance.\nI am pretty sure, though I have never tried, that I couldn't do a\nsonnet, at any price. And if I did, and it leaked out, it would be the\nruin of my business.\"\n\n\"You can buy a sweet sonnet for five shillings, as good as they make\nthem nowadays, but a little common-sense is better than a thousand\nsonnets; and of that, when you are at all yourself, you must have a very\nlarge supply. Now sit down, and let us talk this out. At first it came\nto me as a very great surprise. It was about the last thing that I could\nhave expected. But I think you were wise in coming first to me.\"\n\nWhen I look back upon this interview, it often astonishes me that I\nshould have been able so quietly to take the upper hand with a man not\nonly my elder and of tenfold experience in the world, but also before me\nin natural gifts, and everything that one could think of, except bodily\nstrength and the accident of birth. Nevertheless I did at once, after\nthat weak confession of his, take a decided lead upon him. Why? Because\nhe was plunged into love--a quicksand out of which no man attempts to\npull another, being well aware what he would get for his pains, and\nrather inclined to make sport of him, whenever it may be done, without\nharm to oneself.\n\n\"Well,\" I said, after waiting to see whether he would make another\nstart; but even his vigour was unequal to that, and he felt that he had\ntrespassed over the British bounds of self-control--\"well, let us look\nat this affair like men, and as if there were no woman in it.\" He lifted\nhis hand, by way of protest, as if I were begging the question; but\nseeing how judicious my view was, and desiring perhaps to conciliate me,\nhe pulled out a large cigar and did his best to light it. \"You may take\nit,\" I proceeded, with much magnanimity and some contempt, little\npresaging my own condition in less than a month from that very day,\n\"that I look at these subjects sensibly. I have every reason so far to\nlike you, because you have behaved very well to us. You behaved very\nhandsomely and justly, long before--well, long before you could possibly\nhave taken this strange turn.\"\n\n\"What a way to put it! But let everything be straight. I should never\nhave taken the Hall unless--I mean if anybody else had been there to\nshow me--to show me what a nice place it was.\"\n\n\"I see. Well, never mind how it began. But I will be as straight as you\nare. It is difficult for me to do that, without saying some things to\noffend you.\"\n\n\"Say what you please, Mr. Cranleigh. Say what you will, I shall not\nforget whose brother you are, and that you mean to do your duty to her.\"\n\n\"To the best of my power. In the first place, then, do you know what the\ncharacter of our Grace is? She is gentle, and shy, and affectionate, and\nunselfish as a girl alone can be. On the other hand, she is proud, and\nhigh-spirited, and as obstinate as the very devil. Of money she never\nthinks twice, except for the sake of those around her. She has the very\nloftiest ideals, which she cherishes, but never speaks of them. Can a\nmoney-maker realise them?\"\n\nThis I ought never to have said; for it pained him very bitterly. He\nmade no answer; but the expression of his face showed that I had hit his\nown misgivings.\n\n\"Not that I would make too great a point of that,\" I proceeded more\npolitely; \"for a woman is not like a man altogether, however consistent\nshe may be. And Grace is only a girl after all, so that no one must be\ntoo certain. She forms her own opinions to some extent, and nothing will\nwork her out of them. She takes likes and dislikes at first sight, and\nshe declares they are always justified----\"\n\n\"You don't happen to know, I suppose--I mean you have not formed any\nidea----\"\n\n\"What she thought of you, Mr. Stoneman? No. I was rather surprised that\nshe never said a word that day she was sent for to give you the keys.\nThe utmost I could get out of her was, 'Oh, yes, he was very polite,\nvery polite, I assure you.' And so it is still; as if your entire nature\nwas politeness, and you consisted of good manners.\"\n\n\"Manners maketh man.\" My visitor spoke for the first time lightly, and\nthe smile on his face was no small improvement. \"But you will think that\nI cannot claim them, if I delay any longer to thank you. You have taken\nwhat I had to tell you much better than I could have expected; and for\nthat I am very grateful. But I want to know this. I have heard a good\ndeal of the importance attached by the Cranleighs to their very old\nlineage--Saxon, I believe. But my family has no such claims. We can\nboast no more than this--for three, or four generations at the most, we\nhave been well educated and well off. All business men, no lords of the\nland, no knights with coats of mail, and legs crossed upon a slab. Now\ndoes that make you look down upon me from the height of Salisbury\nsteeple?\"\n\nWithout any knowledge of his wealth, such as most of us look up to, it\nwould have been hard for any one to look down upon the man before me.\nAnd sooth to say, there are plenty of men in his position, and of far\nlower birth than his, who would have considered themselves at the top,\nand me at the bottom of the tower. But before I could answer, a sudden\nflush came over his face, and he rose in haste--for I had made him sit\ndown again--and he seemed to be trying very hard to look as if he were\nnot where he was. Perhaps his conscience told him that he was caught in\nthe attempt to steal a march.\n\nBut my sister Grace (who had just come in with her usual light step, to\ntempt me to have at least a glass of beer before despising everything),\nby some extraordinary gift of sight--though there never have been\nstraighter eyes--Grace never saw that great stockbroker, who wanted her\nnot to look at him.\n\n\"George, this is too bad of you again,\" she began with a smile, almost\ntoo sweet for home-consumption only. \"Work, work, all day, double,\ndouble, toil and trouble; and scarcely a morsel of nourishment!\"\n\n\"Not a bit to eat, is what you generally say, and ever so much better\nEnglish.\" I spoke in that way, because I really do dislike all\naffectation, and I was sure that she had espied the stockbroker.\n\n\"Never mind how I express it,\" said Grace, and I thought that rather\nindependent of her, and it confirmed my conviction that she knew of some\none too ready to make too much of her. \"If you understand it, that is\nenough. But do come, darling George, you make us so sadly anxious about\nyou. What should we do, if you fell ill? And your poor dear eyes that\nwere so blue--the loveliest blue--oh, such a blue----\"\n\nShe knew that her own were tenfold bluer, and mine no more than\ncigar-ash to them. Now a man can put up with a lot of humbug from a\nsister who is good to him; but he must be allowed to break out\nsometimes, or she herself will soon make nought of him. And all this\nunusual gush from Grace, because I had missed my supper beer. When she\noffered to kiss my poor lonely brow, it annoyed me, as I thought of\nbeing superseded.\n\n\"My dear child,\" I said, waving my hand towards the corner where\nStoneman looked envious, \"the light is very dim; but I really should\nhave thought that you must have seen Mr. Stoneman there. Mr. Stoneman,\nallow me to apologise for my sister's apparent rudeness. I fear that she\nover-tries her eyes sometimes.\"\n\nThe stockbroker favoured me with a glance, as if he longed to over-try\nmy eyes too; and then he came forward and offered his hand to my\ndiscomfited sister, with the lowest bow I ever did behold. All this was\na delight to me; but neither of them for the moment seemed to be\nenjoying it.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Stoneman,\" said our Grace, recovering\nherself with a curtsey, as profound as his bow, and a thousand times\nmore graceful. \"Really I must take to spectacles. But I hope, as you\nhave heard my little lecture, you will join me in persuading my dear\nbrother to take a little more care of himself. He works all day long;\nand then at night he sits all by himself and thinks--as I thought he was\ndoing when I came so in the dark.\"\n\nAfter a few more words she left us, departing with a dignity which\nshowed how wrong I must have been in suspecting her of levity.\n\n\"She is--she is----\" Mr. Stoneman stopped, for he could not find\nanything grand enough. \"Oh, I wish I might only call you _George_.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" I replied quite humbly, perceiving a touch of\nbathos, which in human affairs is almost sure to mean a return to\ncommon-sense. \"All over the farm they call me _George_, at any rate\nbehind my back.\"\n\n\"Then, my dear George, I will leave you now. I have had a most\ndelightful visit; and I wish to go and think about it. But do not\nsuppose for a moment that I shall cherish any foolish hopes. I know what\nI am, and what she is. Did you see how she walked from the table? And my\ncigar was smoking on it.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you what to do, my friend?\" I answered rather pettishly;\n\"you are famous for strong decision, as well as quick sagacity. Exert a\nlittle of them now, and put away this weakness.\"\n\n\"It is not my weakness. It is my strength.\"\n\nBefore I could speak again, he was gone. And verily, when I went out of\ndoors, and saw the stars in their distant gaze, and felt the deep\nloneliness of night, it struck me that perhaps this man was wise--to set\nhis heart upon a constant love, some warmth and truth not far to seek,\nand one at least who would never fail to feel his thoughts and endear\nhis deeds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTICKNOR'S MEW\n\n\nSome men there are whom it is a pleasure to observe at their daily work.\nHow they swing their shoulders, and sway their arms, and strain the\nstrong cordage of the bulky thigh, casting weight as well as muscle into\nthe fight they are waging! And this pleasure should be made the most of,\nbecause it is growing very rare. I have heard my grandfather say, that\nwhen he was a boy, one man could do, ay and would insist on doing, more\nwork in a day, than is now to be got out of three by looking hard at\nthem--three men of the very same stock and breed, perhaps even that\ngrandfather's own grandchildren. And the cause which he always assigned\nfor this, though not a bad scholar himself, and even capable of some\nLatin, was the wild cram and pressure of pugnacious education. \"The more\na jug gurgles, the less it pours,\" was his simple explanation.\n\nThere is much to be said on the other side, especially as the things put\ninto their heads are quick enough to go out again, and the Muses as yet\nhave not turned the village-boy into a Ganymede; but the only man, on\nour little farm, who ever worked with might and main had never been at\nschool at all, and his name was Robert Slemmick. To this man nothing\ncame amiss, if only there was enough of it. He was not particularly\nstrong, nor large of frame, nor well put together; but rather of a\nclumsy build and gait, walking always with a stoop, as if he were\ndriving a full wheel-barrow, and swinging both arms at full speed with\nhis legs. But set him at a job that seemed almost too heavy for him,\nand he never would speak, nor even grunt, nor throw down his tool and\nflap his arms, but tear away at it, without looking right or left, till\nyou saw with surprise that this middle-sized man had moved a bigger bulk\nin the course of a day than a couple of hulking navvies.\n\nBut one fault he had, and a very sad fault, which had lost him many a\ngood place ere now, and would probably bring him to the workhouse--he\nwas what is called by those who understand such matters a \"black\nbuster.\" At the nearest approach I could make to this subject, sidling\nvery carefully--for the British workman would be confidential rather to\na ghost than to his own employer--it seems that there are two kinds of\n\"busters.\" The white one, who only leaves work for a spree of a day or\ntwo, meaning to jollify, and to come back in a chastened vein, after\ntreating all his friends, and then going upon trust; and the black, who\nis of a stronger mind. This man knows better than to waste his cash upon\nclinking glasses with a bubble at the top. He is a pattern for weeks and\nmonths together, pours every shilling on a Saturday night into the hands\nof his excellent wife--for it is his luck to have a good one--sits in a\ncorner with his quiet pipe at home, and smiles the smile of memory when\nthe little ones appeal to his wisdom. And so he goes on, without much\nregret for adventure, or even for beer, beyond the half-pint to which\nhis wife coerces him.\n\nEverybody says, \"What a steady fellow Bob is! He is fit for a Guild, if\nhe would only go to Church.\" He ties the Canary creeper up, and he sees\nto his cabbages, upon a Sunday morning. And the next-door lady shakes\nher head over the four-feet palings, with her husband upstairs roaring\nout for a fresher, after a tumble-down night of it. \"Oh, if my Tom was\nlike your Mr. Robert!\" But Mrs. Bob also shakes her head. \"Oh, yes, he\nis wonderful good _just now_.\"\n\nThen comes the sudden break down, and breakaway. Without a word to any\none, or whisper to his family, off sets Mr. Robert, on a Monday morning\ngenerally, after doing two good hours' work, before breakfast. Perhaps\nhe has been touched on the virtuous road home, by a fine smell of beer\nat the corner, where the potboy was washing the pewters, and setting\nthem in the sun for an airing; perhaps it was a flower that set him off,\na scarlet Geranium, who can tell? Under some wild impulse he bolts and\nmakes away; he is in the next parish, before his poor wife has given up\nkeeping the tea-pot warm; and by the time she has knocked at the\ntool-house door, in the forlorn hope that he may be ill, he is rousing\nthe dust of the adjoining county, still going straight ahead, as if the\nDevil were after him. And that last authority alone can tell how Bob\nlives, what he thinks of, where his legs and arms are, whence his beer\nflows down to him, for a month, or even half-a-year, or nobody knows how\nlong it is.\n\nThis Robert Slemmick had been in our employment ever since last\nCandlemas, and had only broken out once as yet, in the manner above\ndescribed. Excepting only that little flaw, his character was excellent,\nand a more hard-working, obliging, intelligent man never came on any\npremises. When I took him back after his escapade, I told him very\nplainly that it would not be done again; and he promised to stick to his\nwork, and did so. But not a word to me, or anybody else, as to why he\nwent away, or whither, or what he had been doing, or how he got his\nliving. Knowing how peculiar the best men are--otherwise could they be\ngood at all?--I tried not to intrude upon the romance of his Beerhaven,\nbut showed myself rather cold to him, though I longed to know about it.\n\n\"Master Jarge,\" said this man one day, when he was treading a hayrick,\nand I was in the waggon with the fork below; and it must according to\nthe times have been the very day after Jackson Stoneman came to me,\n\"Master Jarge, what would 'e give to know summut as I could tell 'e?\"\n\nHe had had a little beer, as was needful for the hay; and I looked at\nhim very seriously; reminding him thus, without harshness, of my opinion\nof his tendencies. But he did not see it in that light.\n\n\"You shape the rick,\" I said. \"I don't want to hear nothing.\" For you\nmust use double negations if you wish them to understand you. We were\nfinishing a little rick of very choice short staple, with a lot of\nclover in it, and _Old Joe_ in the shafts was likely to think of it many\na winter night. At such a juncture, it will not do to encourage even a\nsilent man.\n\nBob went cleverly round and round, dealing an armful here and there, for\na very small round rick is the hardest of all for scientific building,\nand then he came back to the brink close to me, till I thought he was\ngoing to slide down upon my knees.\n\n\"What would 'e give, Master Jarge,\" he whispered, making a tube of his\nbrown, bristly hand, \"to hear all about the most bootifullest maiden as\never come out of the heavens?\"\n\nAlthough I felt a tingle in my heart at this, I answered him very\nfirmly. \"Get on with your work. Don't talk rubbish to me.\"\n\n\"You be the steadiest of the steady. Every fool knows that. But I\nreckon, Master Jarge hath his turn to come, same as every young man the\nLord hath made with a pair of eyes. Oh! our Miss Grace, she be bootiful\nenough. But this one over yonner--O Lord! O Lord!\"\n\nHe waved his hand towards the valley in the distance, whose outline was\nvisible from where we stood. And dignified as I tried to be, he saw my\nglance go wandering.\n\n\"Why, you knows all about it, Master Jarge! You be clapping your eyes\nupon the very place! Why, ne'er a man in England hath ever seed the\nlike. And who could a'thought it, a'standing outside!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" I said. \"Why, you must have been dreaming. Who knows what\ncomes over you sometimes?\"\n\nThis reference to his \"busting\" weakness was not in good taste, when the\ncrime had been forgiven, and the subject was known to be hateful to him.\nBut this was the sure way to let his tongue loose; and when a reserved\nman once breaks forth, he is like a teetotaller going on the spree.\n\n\"I could show 'e the place now just, Master Jarge; the place can't run\naway I reckon. All over ivy-leaves the same as a church-tower. You\ncan't deny of they, when you sees them, can 'e? And the bootiful young\ngal--why, you've seed her, Master Jarge! By the twinkle of your eyes, I\ncould swear to it.\"\n\n\"Robert Slemmick, you are off your head;\" I answered with a very\nsteadfast gaze at him, for his keen little eyes were ready to play \"I\nspy\" with mine. \"I insist upon knowing where you have been, and what you\nhave done, and what people you have met. If they knew that you were in\nSir Harold Cranleigh's service, you may have done us great discredit.\"\n\nWith some indignation he told his tale, and finished it before the other\nmen came back; for his tongue was as brisk as his arms and legs, which\nhad rare gifts of locomotion. But I must fill in what he left out, for\nit would be neither just nor wise to expect him to inform against\nhimself.\n\nIt seems that he was walking very fast, discharging himself from\ndomestic bonds, and responsibility, and temperance, when he came to a\nblack door in a big wall; and rapid as he was, this brought him up. His\nthoughts, if any, were always far in advance of him at such moments, and\nperhaps his main object was to overtake them. This he could not explain,\nand had never thought about it, but at any rate that door should not\nstop him. It was locked, or bolted, and without a bell, but he worked\nall his members together against it, as he alone of mankind could do,\nand what could withstand such progressive power? The door flew open, and\nin rushed Slemmick, like the London County Council.\n\nBut there are powers that pay no heed to the noblest psychical impulse.\nTwo dogs of extraordinary bulk and stature had him prostrate between\nthem in an instant, and stood over him, grinding enormous jaws. Dazed as\nhe was, cold terror kept his restless members quiet, and perhaps he\nfelt--though he did not so confess it--that conjugal law was vindicated.\n\"I were in too terrible a funk to think,\" was his statement of the\nposition.\n\nBut the two dogs appeared to enjoy the situation, and being of prime\nsagacity were discussing his character between them. If he had been a\nmere \"white buster,\" that is to say a common tramp, they would have\nstopped his tramp for ever. But they saw that he was a respectable man,\na sound home-liver in his proper state of mind; and although they would\nnot hear of his getting up, they deliberated what they ought to do with\nhim. Slemmick in the meanwhile was watching their great eyes, and their\ntails flourished high with triumphant duty, and worst of all their\ntremendous white fangs, quivering if he even dared to shudder.\n\n\"Abashed I were to the last degree,\" he told me, and I could well\nbelieve it; \"my last thought was to my poor wife Sally.\" A good partner,\nto whom his first thoughts should have been. But while he was thus truly\npenitent I hope, a clear sound as of a silver whistle came to his ears,\nand the dogs stood up, and took the crush of their paws from his breast,\nand one of them sat by him, in strict vigilance still, while the other\nbounded off for instructions.\n\nThen, according to Slemmick, there appeared to him the most beautiful\nvision he had ever seen. \"Straight from heaven. Don't tell me, Master\nJarge, for never will I hear a word agin it. Straight from heaven, with\nthe big hound a'jumping at her side, and him looking like an angel now.\nIf you was to see her, you'd just go mad, and never care to look at any\nother maid no more.\"\n\n\"What was she like, Bob?\" It had not been my intention to put any\nquestion of this kind, but Slemmick was in such a state of excitement,\nthat I had a right to know the reason.\n\n\"Don't 'e ask me, sir; for good, don't 'e ask me. There never was no\nwords in any Dixunary, and if there was, I couldn't lay to them. There\nthen, you go and judge for yourself, Master Jarge.\"\n\n\"But she can't be there all by herself, my friend. Surely you must have\nseen some one else. And what language did she speak in?\"\n\n\"Blowed if I can tell 'e, sir. All I know is, 't were a mixture of a\nflute and a blackbird, and the play-'em-out-of-Church pipes of the\nhorgan. Not that she were singing, only to the ear, my meaning is; and\nnever mind the words no more than folk does in a hanthem. Lor, to hear\npoor Sally's voice, after coming home from that--even in the wisest\nframe of mind, with all the wages in her lap!\"\n\n\"But you did not come home, Bob Slemmick, for I know not how long. Did\nyou spend the whole of your time in that enchanted valley?\"\n\n\"Ah, a chant it were, by gum! A chant as I could listen to--why, Master\nJarge, I'll take 'e there; for two skips of a flea I would. Won't 'e?\nVery well. Best not, I reckon. Never look at no English maids no more.\"\n\nThis was nearly all that I could get from Bob, without putting hundreds\nof questions; for instead of straight answers, he went off into ravings\nabout this most ravishing young lady, who must have contrived to make\nout what he wanted, for after having saved him from the dogs, she led\nhim directly to the lower door, and sped him on his way with\nhalf-a-crown. But that, as he assured me, was of no account in his\nestimate of her qualities. \"You ask Farmer Ticknor, sir, if you think I\nbe a'lying. Farmer Ticknor hath seed her, more at his comfort than ever\nI did; and Ticknor come hotter than I do. 'Hold your blessed jaw'--he\nsay, when I goeth to ask about her, knowing as he were\nneighbourly--'What call for you, Bob Slemmick?' he saith, 'to come\nrunning like a dog on end down here? I'll give you a charge of shot,' he\nsaith, 'if I catch you in the little lane again. 'T is the Royal Family,\nand no mistake, that knoweth all about this here. And don't you make no\npalaver of it, to come stealing of my mushrooms.' As if we hadn't better\nas we kicks up every day!\"\n\nNow all this talk of Bob's, although it may have told upon my mind a\nlittle, was not enough to set me running straight away from my home and\nfriends, at a very busy time of year, as Slemmick was so fond of doing.\nBut betwixt the green and yellow, as our people call the times of hay\nand corn, it seemed to me that I might as well have a talk with that\nFarmer Ticknor, who was known to be a man of great authority about the\nweather and the crops, and had held land under us as long as he could\nafford to do so. He was rather crusty now, as a man is apt to be when he\nlives upon a crust for the benefit of foreigners, and receives his\nexchange in coloured tallow. It was two or three years since I had seen\nhim now; for \"Ticknor's Mew,\" as he called his place, was out of the\ngeneral course of traffic, and as lonely among the woods as a dead\nfern-frond. I found him at home on a fine summer evening, and he put up\nmy horse, and received me very kindly, for he was not a bad sort of man,\nthough rough. And if any pleasure yet remained in Farmer's lane to\nworkhouse, this man made the most of it by looking at the sky, as if it\nstill could help him against the imbecility of the earth.\n\n\"Yes, I have been a fine hand at it,\" he said, after sending for a jug\nof ale, and two bell-rummers; \"there never was a cloud, but I know the\nmeaning of 'un, though without they long names they has now. Bessie, my\ndear, fetch _Ticknor's marks_. Don't care much to do it now--nought to\nlose or gain of it. Not much odds to this land of England now, what\nweather God Almighty please to send. 'And when they shamed the Lord out\nof caring to mind the harvest, the Government goeth for to hirritate Him\nmore, with a Hoffice to tell us what sort of hat to put upon our heads,\nwhen us can't pay for none. But I'll bet my Sunday beaver against his\nband of gold. What say to that, Mr. Cranleigh? I stuck 'un on the\nbarn-door every marnin' as long as there was anything to care for in the\nwhitfields. It covereth a whole year, don't it, Bessie? Cross stands for\nwrong, and straight line for right.\"\n\n_Ticknor's marks_, as he called his calendar, certainly seemed to hit\nthe mark more often than the men of science did. On a great blackboard\nwere pasted in parallel columns the \"Daily forecasts\" and Farmer\nTicknor's predictions entered at noon of each preceding day. His pretty\ndaughter Bessie, the editor, no doubt, of his oracles, displayed them\nwith no little pride.\n\n\"If you will be pleased to observe, Mr. Cranleigh\"--Bessie had been at a\nboarding-school--\"my father's predictions are in manuscript of\ncourse,\"--and much better than he could write, thought I,--\"while the\nauthorised forecasts are in type. Now the crosses on the manuscript are\nnot quite five per cent; while those upon the printing exceed\nseventy-five. If there were any impartiality in politics, don't you\nthink, Mr. Cranleigh, they would give father the appointment? And he\nwould be glad to do it in these bad times, for less than half the money.\nThough we must not blame the gentlemen who have to do it all through the\nwindow.\"\n\n\"You never hear me boast,\" interrupted the farmer; \"there never was that\ngift in our family. But I'll go bail to give that Meatyard man, or\nwhatever they calls 'un, five pips out of ten--all this reckoning by\nscents hath come after my time--and give 'un twelve hours longer with\nhis arrows and his dots; and then I'll name the day agin him, for the\nbest joint in his yard. But bless your heart and mine too, Master Jarge,\nwhat odds for the weather now? Why, even the hay, they tell me now, is\nto come in little blocks from foreign parts. Make a ton of it they say\nthey can by hyderaulic something come out not a morsel bigger than the\nparish-Bible. Well, well! Well, well!\"\n\nKnowing that if he once began upon \"Free Trade,\" there would be many\nchanges of weather before he stopped, I brought him back to the other\nsubject, and contrived to lead him as far as the margin of the wood,\nwhere the clouds by which he made his divinations could be contemplated\nmore completely; but he told me a great deal about their meanings,\nalthough he knew nothing of their names; all of which I forget, though I\ntried to attend.\n\nIt was not for any knowledge of clouds, or weather, or politics, or even\nharvest-prospects, that I was come to see this Prophet Ticknor in the\nwoods. My mother's favourite subject was the \"Fulfilment of Prophecy;\"\nbut what I cared for now, and thought myself bound to follow out, was\nthe vision (seen by others as well as myself) of a foreign young\nmaiden--if it must be so--unequalled by any of English birth. The\nprevalence of loose commercial ideas, and the prostitution of Britannia\n(so highly respected while she locked her own gate), had given me a turn\nagainst things foreign, though none but my enemies could call me\nnarrow-minded. And here I was open to conviction, as usual, with a\nstrong prepossession against my country, or, at any rate, against her\ngirls, however lovely.\n\n\"I suppose you don't happen to know,\" I said to that excellent Ticknor,\nwhile still among his clouds, \"whether anybody lives in that old place,\nwhere there seems to be such a lot of black stuff? What is it? Ivy it\nlooks like. And old walls behind it, or something very old. I think I\nhave heard of some old Monastery there; and it was part of our property\nlong and long ago. Oh, Farmer Ticknor, how everything does change!\"\n\nThe farmer afforded me a glance of some suspicion. Narrow\ntrade-interests had got the better of him. \"You be gone into the retail\nline,\" he said. \"To think of the Cranleighs coming down to that. But you\ndon't sell milk by the quart now, do 'e?\"\n\nThough I did not see how it could bear upon the subject, I assured him\nthat most of our milk went to London, under contract with a great man,\nwhose name I mentioned; and the rest we kept for making butter.\n\n\"Well, then, I does a good little stroke of business there. Though not\nmuch profit out of that, of course. They takes in a gallon-can every\nmorning. And they asked the boy whether I didn't keep no goats.\"\n\n\"Goats! Why then they must be foreigners,\" I said. \"No English people\ncare about goat's milk. At least, unless their doctor orders it.\"\n\n\"They ha'n't got no doctor, and don't want none. A rare strong lot\naccording to all I hear. Toorks I call them, and I put it on the bill,\n'Toork Esquire, debtor to John Ticknor.' Having raised no objection, why\nit stands they must be Toorks.\"\n\n\"But people can't live on milk alone, Mr. Ticknor. And they must have\nsome other name besides Turks. Even if they are Turks, which I scarcely\ncan believe.\"\n\n\"Well, you knows more about them than I do, sir. I never form an\nopinion, so long as they pays me good English money. But they never has\nno butcher's meat, nor no beer; and that proves that they bain't English\nfolk. If you want to know more about them, Mr. Cranleigh, the one as can\nteach you is my dog _Grab_. _Grab_ feeleth great curiosity about them,\nbecause of the big dogs inside the old wall. He hath drashed every other\ndog in the parish; and it goeth very hard with him to have no chance to\ndrash they. Never mind, old boy, your time will come.\"\n\nAn atrocious bull-dog of the fiercest fighting type, who had followed\nus from the farmhouse, was nuzzling into his master's grey whiskers. Now\nI love nearly all dogs, and, as a rule, they are very good to me; but\nthat surly fellow, who is supposed to be the type of our national\ncharacter, does not appear to me, by any means, adorable. Very faithful\nhe may be, and consistent, and straightforward, and devoted to his duty.\nBut why should he hold it a part of his duty to kill every gentle and\naccomplished dog he meets, unless the other dips his tail, the canine\nensign, to him? And of all the bull-dogs I have ever seen, this _Grab_\nwas the least urbane and polished. A white beast with three grisly\npatches destroying all candour of even blood-thirstiness, red eyes\nleering with treacherous ill-will, hideous nostrils, like ulcers cut\noff, and enormous jowls sagging from the stark white fangs. He saw that\nI disliked him, and a hearty desire to feel his tusks meet in my throat\nwas displayed in the lift of his lips, and the gleam of his eyes.\n\n\"Wonnerful big hounds they furriners has, according to what my milk-boy\nsays,\" the farmer continued, with a plaintive air; \"but they never lets\nthem free of the big wall hardly, to let _Grab_ see what they be made\nof. But come back to house, and have a bit of supper with us, before you\ngo home, Mr. Cranleigh. 'T is a roughish ride even in summer-time.\"\n\n\"Thank you; not a bit to eat; but perhaps before I go, another glass of\nyour very fine home-brewed. But I see a tree down in the valley there,\nthat I should like to know more about. I'll follow you back to the house\nin a few minutes. But how long did you say that those strangers have\nbeen here? It seems such an odd thing that nobody appears to know\nanything about them.\"\n\n\"Well, a goodish long while they must have been there now. And they\ndon't seem to make no secret of it. Bakes their own bread, if they have\nany; never has any carriage-folk to see them, never comes out with a gun\nto pot a hare; don't have no fishmonger, butcher, grocer, nor any boy to\ncall out 'papper' at the door. My boy Charlie is uncommon proud, because\nhe have got into their 'Good-morning.' They says it like Christians, so\nfar as he can judge, and naturally he sticketh up for them. You can ask\nhim, Master Jarge, if you think fit. Nothing clandestical about\nTicknor's Mew. But none of them Inspectors to pump into our milk, and\nswear as we did it. That's why I keep you, _Grab_.\"\n\nFarmer Ticknor made off with this little grumble, lifting his hat to me,\nuntil I should return. For he did not look down upon the \"Gentry of the\nland,\" for being out at elbows. After thinking for a minute of all that\nI had heard, which was not very much to dwell upon, I twirled my\nriding-crop (which I had brought from habit, and been glad to have when\nI watched _Grab's_ teeth), and set off with a light foot, to explore\nthat lonely valley.\n\nI was now on the opposite side from that by which I had entered it to\nthe tune of the nightingale, and at first I could scarcely make out my\nbearings. For though I had seen it afar with Tom Erricker, something\nprevented me from letting him come near it. Tom was an excellent fellow\nin his way; but of reverence and lofty regard for women no decent\nEnglishman could have much less. Decent I say, because if such\nsentiments are cast by, and scoffed at--as fools think it clever to\ndo--the only thing left is indecency.\n\nThis valley was not like many places, that are tempting only at a\ndistance. The deeper I found myself in it, the more I was filled with\nits gentleness and beauty. It has never been in my line at all to be\nable to convey what comes across me,--when I see things that look as if\nthey called upon us to be grateful for the pleasure they contribute to\nour minds. Certain people can do this, as some can make fine\nafter-dinner speeches, while others are more fitted to rejoice inside.\nAnd if I were to fail in depicting a landscape, such as any Surrey man\nmay see by walking a few miles, how would you care to follow me into the\ngrandest scenery the Maker of the earth has made anywhere, unless it be\nin His own temple of the heavens?\n\nEnough that it was a very lovely valley, winding wherever it ought to\nwind, and timbered just where it should be, with the music of a bright\nbrook to make it lively, and the distance of the hills to keep it\nsheltered from the world. And towards the upper end where first the\nstream came wimpling into it, that ancient wall, which had baffled me,\nenclosed a large piece of land as well as some length of watercourse,\nbut gave no other token of its purpose. This was what I cared most\nabout; for stupid and unreasonable as it must appear, a sharp spur had\nbeen clapped to my imagination by the vague talk of Slemmick and\nTicknor. And not only that, but to some extent, the zeal and the ardour\nof Jackson Stoneman, and his downright policy, had set me thinking that\npoor as I was, while he was rolling in money, the right of my manhood\nwas the same as his--to pursue by all honest means the one fair image\nwhich a gracious power had disclosed to me. Therefore, after looking at\nthe tree to soothe my conscience, I followed the course of that\nwandering wall, by no means in a sneaking manner, but showing myself\nfairly in the open meadows, and walking as one who takes exercise for\nhealth.\n\nThe wall was on my left hand, all the way from the track (in which the\nsteep road ended after crossing the brook) and although I would rather\nsink into a bog than seek to be spying impertinently, nothing could have\ncome upon that wall, and no one could have peeped over it without my\ntaking it in at a side-flick. But I only had sense of one thing moving\nthroughout all my circuit, and that was but little to comfort me. Just\nas I was slipping by the upper door (which Slemmick had burst open), and\ntaking long strides--for if some one had opened it and asked what I\nwanted there, how could I, as a gentleman, tell the whole\ntruth?--suddenly there appeared within a square embrasure, and above the\nparapet among the ivy, the most magnificent head I ever saw. Mighty\neyes, full of deep intelligence, regarded me, noble ears (such as no man\nis blest with) quivered with dignified inquiry, while a majestic pair of\nnostrils, as black as night, took sensitive quest of the wind, whether\nany of the wickedness of man were in it.\n\nKnowing that I only intended for the best, though doubtful if that would\nstand me in much stead, supposing that this glorious dog took another\nview of it, I addressed him from below with words of praise, which he\nevidently put aside with some contempt. He was considering me\nimpartially and at leisure; and if I had moved he would have bounded\ndown upon me. Luckily I had the sense to stand stock-still, and afford\nhim every facility for study of my character. At the same time I looked\nat him, not combatively, but as if I felt similar interest in him, which\nI had excellent reason for doing. To my great relief his eyes assumed a\nkind expression; by the pleasant waving of his ears I could tell that\nhis tail was wagging, and he showed a bright dimple beneath his black\nwhiskers, and smiled with the humour which is far beyond our ken.\nWhereupon I nodded to him, and made off.\n\nWhen I came to think of him, in that coarser frame of mind in which we\nexplain everything so meanly, it occurred to me that those noble\nnostrils, curving like the shell of Amphitrite, were scarcely moved so\nmuch perhaps by the influence of my goodness, as by the fragrance of my\nsister's spaniel, _Lady Silky_, who had nestled in my hairy jacket,\nwhile I was casting up accounts that day. However, be his motive large\nor small, he had formed a friendly opinion of me, and when I disappeared\namong the trees, a low whine followed me as if the place had grown more\nlonely.\n\nUpon the whole I had made some progress towards the solution of this\nstrange affair. Within those walls there must be living a settlement of\nforeigners, an establishment of some size, to judge by the quantity of\nmilk they used. Some of them could speak English, but they did not seem\nto associate with any of their neighbours, and probably procured from\nLondon the main part of what they needed. To Farmer Ticknor, as to most\nof the rustics round about us, all who were not of British birth were\neither Turks or Frenchmen. To my mind these were neither; and the\npossession of those noble dogs--a breed entirely new to me--showed that\nthey were not dwelling here to conceal their identity, or to retrench\nfrom poverty. For there were at least two dogs, perhaps more, worth a\nhundred guineas each to any London dealer at the lowest computation, and\nnot by any means qualified to live on scanty rations. Another point I\nhad ascertained--that the old Mill, out of use for many years, was now\nat work again. This had been built, no one knows how long ago, among\nthe monastic ruins upon the never-failing Pebblebourne. And while I was\ncounting the moments for that gigantic dog to spring down on me, I heard\nvery clearly the plash of the wheel, and the boom and murmur of the\nworks inside.\n\nAs a last chance of picking up something more, when I was getting on my\nhorse, I said across his mane to the fair Bessie Ticknor, that\n\"highly-cultured\" maiden,--\"A little bird has told me, though I would\nnot listen to him, that a young lady almost as pretty as Miss Ticknor\nlives in a valley not a hundred miles from here.\" Bessie raised her\njet-black eyes, and blushed, and simpered, and whispered, so that her\nfather could not hear it:--\n\n\"Oh, I 'd give anything to know! It is such a romantic mystery! Culture\ndoes put such a cruel curb upon curiosity. But it does not take much to\nsurpass _me_, Mr. Cranleigh.\"\n\n\"We are not all quite blind in this world, Miss Ticknor; though some may\ntry to contradict their looking-glass.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTRUE HYGIENE\n\n\nWhenever my brother Harold deigned to visit us from London, we had not\nmuch time to do anything more than try to understand his last idea. If\nhe had only been fond of society, or philosophy, or even ladies, we\ncould have got on with him ever so much better; for he really never\nmeant any harm at all. Pity for the pressure he was putting on his brain\nsaddened to some extent the pride which he inspired; and when he came\ndown to announce his last _eureka_, the first thing my mother did was to\nmake him show his tongue. My mother did think mighty things of this the\nfirst-born child she had; and him a son--endowed beyond all\nsister-babies with everything. Nevertheless she did her utmost to be\nfair to all of us; and sometimes when her eyes went round us, at\nChristmastime, or birthdays, any stranger would have thought that we all\nwere gifted equally.\n\nI am happy to say that this was not the case. Never has it been my gift\nto invent anything whatever; not even a single incident in this tale\nwhich I am telling you. Everything is exactly as it happened; and\naccording to some great authorities, we too are exactly as we happened.\n\nBut my brother Harold can never have happened. He must have been\ndesigned with a definite purpose, and a spirit to work his way\nthroughout, although it turned to Proteus. He had been through every\ncraze and fad,--I beg his pardon,--Liberation of the Age, Enlightenment,\nAmelioration of Humanity, &c. &c., and now in indignation at the Pump\nCourt drains, he was gone upon what he called _Hygiene_.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean, by this blessed Hygiene?\" Though by no\nmeans strong at poetry, I turned out this very neat couplet one day,\nwith the indignation that makes verses, when I saw that he had a big\ntrunk in the passage, which certain of us still called the hall.\n\n\"George, will you never have any large ideas?\" he replied with equal\nrudeness, such as brothers always use. \"This time, even you will find it\nhard to be indifferent to my new discovery. The ardour of truth has\ntriumphed.\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" I said, for he had had his dinner, though that made very\nlittle difference to him, his ardour of truth being toast and water now.\n\"But if you won't have a pipe, I will. Is the smell anti-hygienic?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly it is. About that there cannot be two sane opinions. Puff\naway; but be well assured that at every pull you are inhaling, and at\nevery expiration spreading--\"\n\n\"All right. Tell us something new, and you are never far to seek in\nthat--Pennyroyal, fenugreek, ruta nigra, tin-tacks hydrised, hyoscyamus,\ncolocasia, geopordon carbonised--what is the next panacea?\"\n\n\"Tabacum Nicotianum.\" Nothing pleased my brother more than the charge of\ninconsistency and self-contradiction. Seeing that he lay in wait for\nthis, I would not let him have it, but answered with indifference--\n\n\"That is right, old fellow. I am glad that you have come to a sensible\nview of Tobacco. Any very choice cigars in your trunk, old chap? But I\nshould fear that you had invented them.\"\n\nNo one could help liking Harold at first sight. He was simply the most\namiable fellow ever seen. Amiable chiefly in a passive way, although he\nwas ready for any kind action, when the claims of discovery permitted.\nAnd now as we were strolling in the park, and the fine Surrey air had\nbrightened his handsome face with more \"hygiene\" than he ever would\nproduce, I was not surprised at the amount of money he extracted even\nfrom our groans.\n\n\"Would you like to know what is in my trunk?\" he asked with that simple\nsmile, which was at once the effect and the cause of his magnetism. \"I\nhave done it for the sake of the family first, and then of the\nneighbourhood, and then of the county. I shall offer the advantages to\nSurrey first. As an old County family, that is our duty. There is some\nlow typhoid in the valleys still. Run and fetch my trunk, George. It is\nheavy for me, but nothing for your great shoulders. Bring it to the\nbower here; I don't want to open it in the house, because,\nbecause--well, you'll soon know why, when you follow my course of\nreasoning.\"\n\nI brought him his trunk, and he put it on a table, where people had tea\nin the park sometimes, to watch a game of cricket from a sheltered\nplace. \"Come quite close,\" he said very kindly, throwing open the trunk,\nand then making for the door, while I rashly stooped over his property.\nIn another minute I was lying down, actually sneezed off my legs, and\nunable to open my eyes from some spasmodic affection or affliction.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Harold, in a tone of satisfaction; \"don't be\nuneasy, my dear brother. For at least a fortnight you are immune from\nthe biggest enterprises of the most active Local Board. You may sit upon\nthe manholes of the best sanitated town; you may sleep in the House of\nCommons; you may pay a medical fee, and survive it. It is my own\ndiscovery. See those boxes?\"\n\n\"Not yet. But I shall as soon as my eyes get right!\" I was able now to\nleave off sneezing, almost for a second. And when I had chewed a bit of\nleaf he gave me, there seemed to be something great in this new idea.\n\n\"You are concluding with your usual slur\"--my brother began again, as\nsoon as I was fit to receive reason instead of sympathy--\"that this is\nnothing more than an adaptation of _Lundy Foote_, _Irish blackguard_, or\n_Welsh Harp_. George, you are wrong, as usual. You need not be capable\nof speech for that. Your gifts of error can express themselves in\nsilence.\"\n\n\"Cowardly reasoner,\" I began, but the movement of larynx, or whatever it\nmight be, threw me out of \"ratiocination.\" He had me at his mercy, and\nhe kept me so. To attempt to repeat what he said would convict me of\ncrankiness equal to his own, and worse--because he could do it, and I\ncannot. But the point he insisted on most of all, and which after my\nexperience I could not but concede, was that no known preparation of\nsnuff without his special chemistry could have achieved this excellence.\n\n\"Pteroxylon, euphorbium, and another irritant unknown as yet to\nChemists, have brought this to the power needful. But this is not a\nmerely speculative thing. You feel a true interest in it now, George.\"\n\n\"As men praise mustard, with tears in their eyes. But let me never hear\nof it, think of it, most of all never smell the like again. My nose will\nbe red, and my eyes sore for a fortnight.\"\n\nHarold tucked my arm under his, with a very affectionate manner of his\nown, which he knew that I never could resist. \"Four pockets always in\nyour waistcoat,\" he observed, \"and a flap over every one to keep it dry.\nNow I very seldom ask a favour, do I, George, of you? Here are three\nhundred little boxes here, as well as the bulk of my preparation. The\nboxes are perfectly air-tight, made from my own design, very little\nlarger and not much thicker than an old crown-piece. You touch a spring\nhere, and the box flies open. Without that you never would know that it\nwas there. Promise me that you will always carry this, and open it\nwhenever you come to a place where the Local Boards have got the roads\nup. One of my best friends, and I have not many, has lost his only\nlittle girl,--such a darling, she used to sit upon my knee and promise\nto marry me the moment she was big enough,--but now she has gone to a\nbetter world, through the new parish authorities. Diphtheria in the\nworst form, my dear boy!\"\n\nHis eyes filled with tears, for he was very tender-hearted, and in the\nwarmth of the moment, I promised to carry that little box of his, as a\nsafeguard against sanitation.\n\n\"My dear George, you will never regret it. You will find it most useful,\nI can assure you.\" He spoke with some gratitude, for he knew how much I\nhated all such chemistry. Little did I think how true his words would\nprove.\n\n\"Why, there goes that extraordinary fellow Stoneman!\" I exclaimed\nsuddenly, to change the subject. \"What a first-rate horse he always\nrides! But there is something I ought to tell you about that great\nStockbroker. I have not told the Governor yet, because I was not meant\nto do so, and must not, without the man's consent. But you ought to know\nit, and he would not object to that.\"\n\n\"What has he discovered? I have often thought that men, who fall into\nthe thick of humanity, ought to get their minds into an extremely active\nstate; like mariners straining their eyes to discover--\"\n\n\"The Gold Coast. There is nothing else they care for. But there I am\nwronging Jackson Stoneman. He is a man of the world, if there ever was\none; and yet he is taken above the world, by love.\"\n\n\"Love of what?\" asked my brother, who was sometimes hard upon people who\ndespised all the things he cared for. \"Love of gold? Love of rank? Love\nof dainty feeding? Love of his own fat self perhaps?\"\n\n\"He is not fat. He is scarcely round enough. He is one of the most\nactive men in the kingdom. There are very few things that he cannot do.\nAnd now he is deeply and permanently in love--\"\n\n\"With filthy lucre. If there is anything I hate, it is the scorn of\nhumanity that goes with that.\" Harold, in a lofty mood, began to strap\nup the trunk that was to save mankind.\n\n\"If filthy lucre means our Grace,\" I said with much emphasis, for it was\ngood to floor him, \"you have hit the mark. But our Grace has not a\nfarthing.\" I very nearly added--\"thanks to you.\" But it would have been\ncruel, and too far beyond the truth.\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" he answered, trying not to look surprised, though I knew\nthat I had got him there. \"Why, his grandfather kept a shoe-shop.\"\n\n\"That is a vile bit of lying gossip. But even if it were so, the love of\nhumanity should not stop short of their shoes. I am afraid you are a\nsnob, Harold, with all your vast ideas.\"\n\n\"I am a little inclined to that opinion myself,\" he answered very\ncordially. \"But come, this is very strange news about Grace. Has she any\nidea of the honour done her?\"\n\n\"Not the smallest. So far as I know at least. And I think it is better\nthat she should not know. Just at present, I mean, until he has had\ntime.\"\n\n\"But surely, George, you would not encourage such a thing. Putting aside\nthe man's occupation, which may be very honourable if he is so himself,\nwhat do we know of his character, except that he gives himself airs, and\nis rather ostentatious?\"\n\n\"He gives himself no airs. What you call ostentation is simply his\ngenerosity. You forget that in right of his wealth he stands in the\nplace we have lost through our poverty. That makes it a delicate\nposition for him, especially in his behaviour to us. And do what he\nwill, we should scarcely do our duty to ourselves, unless we made the\nworst of it.\"\n\n\"How long have you turned Cynic? Why, you put that rather neatly; I did\nnot think it was in you, George.\" It should be explained that my brother\nHarold could never be brought to see that it was possible for me to do\nanything even fairly well; unless it were in manual labour, or sporting,\nor something else that he despised. And this was all I got for my\nadmiration of his powers!\n\n\"Never mind about me,\" I replied; \"I am not a Cynic, and I never shall\nbe one. And when I spoke thus, I had not the least intention of\nincluding my father, who is above all such stuff. But mother, and you\nand I, and no doubt Grace herself, although she thinks so well of\neverybody,--it would be against all human nature for us to take a kind\nor even candid view of our successor's doings. And as for his station in\nlife, as you might call it, you must live entirely out of the world,\neven in the heart of London, not to know that he is placed far above us\nnow. Everywhere, except among the old-fashioned people who call\nthemselves the County families, a man of his wealth would be thought\nmuch more of, than we should have a chance of being. What good could we\ndo to anybody now? you must learn to look up to him, Harold my boy.\"\n\n\"Very well. I'll study him, whenever I get the chance. I can't look up\nto any man for his luck alone; though I may for the way he employs it.\nBut he must not suppose that his money will buy Grace. If ever there\nwas a girl who tried to think for herself and sometimes succeeded,\nprobably it is our Grace. She cannot do much. What woman has ever yet\nmade any real discovery, although they are so inquisitive? But she has a\nright to her own opinion.\"\n\n\"At any rate as to the disposal of herself.\" Here I was on strong\nground; though I never could argue with Harold upon scientific\nquestions. But I knew my dear Grace much better than he did; and she\nalways said that she liked me best, whenever I put that question to her;\nnot only to make up for mother's preferences in the wrong direction, but\nalso because she could understand me,--which did not require much\nintelligence,--not to mention that I was much bigger and stronger than\nHarold, though nothing like so good-looking, as anybody could see with\nhalf an eye.\n\n\"Leave it so,\" said Harold; for he liked sometimes to assert himself, as\nhe had the right to do, when he cast away scientific weaknesses. \"Let\nsuch things take their course, old fellow. If Grace takes a liking to\nhim, that will prove that he is worthy of it. For she is uncommonly hard\nto please. And she never seems to care about understanding me; perhaps\nbecause she knows it would be hopeless. I want to go on to Godalming\nto-morrow. There will be a meeting of Sanitary Engineers--the largest\nminds of the period. I speak of them with deference; though as yet I am\nunable to make out what the dickens they are up to. Can you get me the\none-horse trap from _The Bell_?\"\n\n\"Most likely. I will go and see about it by-and-by. Old Jacob will\nalways oblige me if he can. But you won't take away your sneezing trunk?\nYou owe it to your native parish first.\"\n\n\"My native parish must abide its time. In country places there is seldom\nany outbreak of virulent diseases, until they set up a Local Board. I\nshall leave a score of Hygioptarmic boxes in your charge. The rest are\nmeant for places where the authorities stir up the dregs of infection,\nand set them in slow circulation. And the first thing a Local Board\nalways does is that.\"\n\nI did not contradict him, for the subject was beyond me. And fond as I\nwas of him, and always much enlarged by his visits, and the stirring up\nof my dull ideas, it so happened that I did not want him now, when so\nmany things had to be considered, in which none of his discoveries would\nhelp me. In fact it seemed to me that he thought much more of his\nhygienic boxes, than of his and my dear sister.\n\nWhen he was gone in the old rattle-trap from _The Bell_, with his trunk\nbeneath his feet, my mother seemed inclined at first to think that no\none had made enough of him.\n\n\"All for the benefit of others!\" she exclaimed, after searching the\ndistance for one last view of him, if, haply, the sun might come out for\nthe purpose of showing his hat above some envious hedge; \"Does that poor\nboy ever think of himself? What makes it the more remarkable is that\nthis age is becoming so selfish, so wedded to all the smaller principles\nof action, so incapable of taking a large view of anything. But Harold,\nmy Harold\"--no words of the requisite goodness and greatness occurred to\nmy dear mother, and so she resorted to her handkerchief. \"It seems as if\nwe always must be parted. It is for the good of mankind, no doubt; but\nit does seem hard, though no one except myself seems so to regard it. It\nwas five o'clock yesterday before he came. It is not yet half-past ten,\nand to think of the rapidly-increasing distance--\"\n\n\"I defy him to get more than five miles an hour out of that old screw,\"\nI said. \"Not even with one of his Hygioptarmic boxes tied beneath the\nold chap's tail. Why, you can hear his old scuffle still, mother.\"\n\nShe listened intently, as if for a holy voice; while Grace looked at me\nwith a pleasant mixture of reproach and sympathy. For who did all the\nreal work? Who kept the relics of the property together? Who relieved\nthe little household of nearly all its trouble? Who went to market to\nbuy things without money, and (which is even harder still) to sell them\nwhen nobody wanted them? Who toiled like a horse, and much longer than a\nhorse--however, I never cared to speak up for myself. As a general rule,\nI would rather not be praised. And as for being thanked, it is pleasant\nin its way, but apt to hurt the feelings of a very modest man; and, of\ncourse, he knows that it will not last. After such a speech from my dear\nmother, no one could have blamed me very severely, if I had put my\nfishing-rod together and refused to do another stroke of work that day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\n_KUBAN_\n\n\nThat evening we stuck to our work, like Britons, and got all the ricks\ncombed down so well, and topped up ready for thatching, that the weather\nwas welcome to do what it pleased, short of a very heavy gale of wind.\nNot a mowing-machine, nor a patent haymaker, had been into our meadows,\nnor any other of those costly implements, which farmers are ordered by\ntheir critics to employ, when they can barely pay for scythe and rake.\nAll was the work of man and horse, if maids may be counted among the\nmen--for, in truth, they had turned out by the dozen, from cottage, and\nfarm, and the great house itself, to help the poor gentleman who had\nbeen rich, and had shown himself no prouder then than now.\n\nFor about three weeks, while the corn began to kern, and Nature wove the\nfringe before she spread the yellow banner, a man of the farm, though\nstill wanted near at hand, might take a little change and look about him\nmore at leisure, and ask how his neighbours were getting on, or even\nindulge in some distractions of his own. Now, in summer, a fellow of a\nquiet turn, who has no time to keep up his cricket, and has never heard\nof golf,--as was then the case with most of us,--and takes no delight in\ngreen tea-parties, neither runs after moths and butterflies, however\nattractive such society may be, this man finds a riverbank, or, better\nstill, a fair brook-side, the source of the sweetest voices to him. Here\nhe may find such pleasure as the indulgence of Nature has vouchsafed to\nthose who are her children still, and love to wander where she offers\nleisure, health, and large delights. So gracious is she in doing this,\nand so pleased at pleasing us, that she stays with us all the time, and\nbreathes her beauty all around us, while we forget all pains and\npassions, and administer the like relief to fish.\n\nWorms, however, were outside my taste. To see a sad creature go\nwriggling in the air, and then, cursing the day of its birth, descend\nupon the wet storm of the waters, and there go tossing up and down,\nwithout any perception of scenery--this (which is now become a very\nscientific and delicate art in delusion of trout) to me is a thing below\nour duty to our kin. A fish is a fellow that ought to be caught, if a\nman has sufficient skill for it. But not with any cruelty on either\nside; though the Lord knows that they torment us more, when they won't\nbite on any conditions, than some little annoyance we may cause\nthem--when we do pull them out--can balance.\n\nCertain of the soundness of these views, if, indeed, they had ever\noccurred to me, but despairing to convince my sister of them,--for women\nhave so little logic,--I fetched out a very ancient fly-book, with most\nof the hackles devoured by moth-grubs, and every barb as rusty as old\nenmity should grow. Harold never fished; he had no patience for it; and\nas for enjoying nature, his only enjoyment was to improve it. Tom\nErricker, who was lazy enough to saunter all day by a river, while he\ntalked as if examiners were scalping him, not an atom did he know of any\nsort of fishing, except sitting in a punt, and pulling roach in, like a\npod of seedy beans upon a long beanstick. Therefore was everything in my\nbook gone rusty, and grimy, and maggoty, and looped into tangles of\nyellow gut,--that very book which had been the most congenial love of\nboyhood. If I had only taken half as well to Homer, Virgil, Horace, I\nmight have been a Fellow of All Souls now (Bene natus, bene vestitus)\nand brought my sister Grace to turn the heads of Heads of Houses, in the\ngrand old avenue, where the Dons behold the joys that have slipped away\nfrom them.\n\nBut perhaps I should never have been half as happy. To battle with the\nworld, instead of battening in luxury, is the joy of life, while there\nis any pluck and pith. And I almost felt, as a man is apt to feel, when\nin his full harness, and fond of it, that to step outside of it, even\nfor a few hours, was a bit of self-indulgence unworthy of myself.\nHowever, I patched up a cast of two flies, which was quite enough, and\nmore than enough, for a little stream like the Pebblebourne, wherein I\nhad resolved to wet my line.\n\nThis was a swift bright stream, as yet ungriddled by any railway works,\nand unblocked by any notice-boards menacing frightful penalties. For\nalthough the time was well-nigh come when the sporting rights over\nEnglish land should exceed the rental in value, the wary trout was not\nyet made of gold and rubies; and in many places any one, with permission\nof the farmers, was welcome to wander by the babbling brook, and add to\nits music, if the skill were in him, the silvery tinkle of the leaping\nfish. And though all this valley was but little known to me, a call at a\nlonely farm-house on the hill, a mile or two further on than Ticknor's\nMew, made me free of the water and them that dwelled therein.\n\nNow why should I go to this Pebblebourne, rather than to some other\nSurrey stream, fishful, picturesque, and better known to anglers? Partly\nI believe through what Robert Slemmick said, and Farmer Ticknor after\nhim, and partly through my own memories. There can be no prying air, or\npushing appearance about a gentle fisherman, who shows himself intent\nupon the abstract beauties of a rivulet, or the concrete excellence of\nthe fish it holds. My mother liked nothing better than a dish of trout,\nmy father (though obliged to be very careful about the bones) considered\nthat fish much superior to salmon, ever since salmon had been propagated\ninto such amazing rarity. So I buckled on a basket, which would hold\nsome 50lb., took an unlimited supply of victuals, and set forth to clear\nthe Pebblebourne of trout.\n\nMy mother had no supper except toasted cheese that night, although I\nreturned pretty early; neither did my father find occasion to descant\nupon the inferiority of salmon. And the same thing happened when I went\nagain. I could see great abundance of those very pleasing fish, and they\nsaw an equal abundance of me. They would come and look at my fly, with\nan aspect of gratifying approval, as at a laudable specimen of clever\nplagiarism, and then off with them into the sparkles and wrinkles of the\nfrisky shallows, with a quick flop of tail, and yours truly till next\ntime. And yet I kept out of sight and cast up-stream, and made less mark\nthan a drop of rain on the silver of the stream.\n\nI was half inclined to drop any third attempt, having daintily treated\nsome meadows of brook, without any token of fish to carry home, or of\nhuman presence to stow away in heart, although I had persisted to the\nvery door, which had swallowed that fair vision, in the twilight of the\nMay. Her little shrine and holy place I never had profaned, feeling that\na stranger had no business there; neither could I bring myself to hang\nabout in ambush, and lurk for the hour of her evening prayer and hymn.\nBut my dear mother seemed to lose her fine faith in my skill; for ladies\nare certain to judge by the event; moreover to accept a beating lightly\nwas entirely against my rules. So I set forth once again, saying to\nmyself--\"the third time is lucky. Let us have one more trial.\"\n\nOn that third evening of my labour against stream, I was standing on the\nbank, where the bridle-track came through, and packing up my rod, after\nbetter luck with fish, for I had found a fly which puzzled them, and had\ntaken a good dozen--when who should come up gambolling round my heels,\nand asking, as it seemed to me, for a good word, or a pat, but that\nmagnificent and very noble dog who had reviewed, and so kindly approved\nof me, from the battlements near the upper door? \"What is your name, my\nstately friend?\" I said to him, not without some misgivings that he\nmight resent this overture. But he threw up his tail like a sheaf of\ngolden wheat, and made the deep valley ring, and the heights resound,\nwith a voice of vast rejoicing, and a shout of glorious freedom.\n\nBut was it this triumph that provoked the fates? While the echoes still\nwere eddying in the dimples of the hills, a white form arose on the\ncrest of the slope some fifty yards behind us. A vast broad head, with\nears prickled up like horns of an owl, and sullen eyes under patches of\nshade, regarded us; while great teeth glimmered under bulging jowls, and\nsquat red nostrils were quivering with disdain. It was _Grab_, Farmer\nTicknor's savage bull-dog; and hoping that he would be scared, as most\ndogs are, when they have no business, by the cast of a stone, I threw a\npebble at him, which struck the ground under his burly chest. He noticed\nit no more than he would heed a grasshopper, but began to draw upon us,\nas a pointer draws on game, with his wiry form rigid, and his hackles\nlike a tooth-brush, and every roll of muscle like an oak burr-knot.\n\nI drew the last loops of my line through the rings, and wound up the\nreel in all haste, and detaching the butt of my rod stood ready, for it\nlooked as if he meant to fly at me. But no, he marched straight up to my\nnoble friend, with blazing eyes fixed on him, and saluted him with a\nsnarl of fiendish malice. Clearly my dog, as I began to consider him,\nhad no experience of such low life. He was a gentleman by birth and\nsocial habits, not a coarse prize-fighter; so he stood looking down with\nsome surprise at this under-bred animal, yet glancing pleasantly as if\nhe would accept a challenge to a bout of gambols, as my lord will play\ncricket with a pot-boy. Nay, he even went so far as to wag his courtly\ntail, and draw his taper fore-legs, which shone like sable, a little\nbeneath the arch of his body, to be ready for a bound, if this other\nchap meant play. _Grab_ spied the mean chance, and leaped straight at\nhis throat, but missed it at first, or only plunged his hot fangs into a\nsoft rich bed of curls. My dog was amazed, and scarcely took it in\nearnest yet. His attitude was that of our truly peaceful nation--\"I\ndon't want to fight, but, by Jingo, if I must, it won't be long before\nthis little bully bites the dust.\"\n\n\"At him, _Grab_, at him, boy! Show 'un what you be made of! Tip 'un a\ntaste of British oak. Give 'un a bellyful. By the Lord in Heaven, would\nyou though?\"\n\nI stretched my rod in front of Ticknor, as he appeared from behind a\nridge, dancing on his heavy heels at the richness of the combat, and\nthen rushing at the dog, my friend, with a loaded crab-stick, because he\nhad got the bull-dog down and was throwing his great weight upon him. He\nhad tossed him up two or three times as if in play, for he seemed even\nnow not to enter into the deadliness of the enemy.\n\n\"Fair play, farmer!\" I said sternly. \"It was your beast that began it.\nLet him have a lesson. I hope the foreign dog will kill him.\"\n\nNo fair-minded person could help perceiving the chivalry of the one, and\nbestiality of the other; while the combat grew furious for life or\ndeath, with tossing and whirlings, and whackings of ribs, and roars of\ndeep rage on the part of my friend, while the other scarcely puffed or\npanted, but fought his fight steadily from the ground, and in deadly\nsilence.\n\n\"Furriner can't hurt 'un much,\" said the farmer, as I vainly strove to\nget between them; \"made of iron and guttaperk our _Grab_ is. I've been\na'biding for this, for two months. I sent 'e fair warning, Master\nGeorge, by that fellow Slemmick, that you might not lose it. Fair play,\nyou says; and I say the very same. Halloa! our _Grab_ hath got his hold\nat last. Won't be long in this world for your furriner now. Well done,\nour _Grab_! Needn't tell 'un to hold fast.\"\n\nTo my dismay, I saw that it was even so. My noble foreign friend was\nstill above the other, but his great frame was panting and his hind-legs\ntwitching, and long sobs of exhaustion fetching up his golden flanks.\nThe sleuth foe, the murderer, had him by his gasping throat, and was\nsucking out his breath with bloody fangs deep-buried.\n\n\"Let 'un kill 'un. Let 'un kill 'un!\" shouted Farmer Ticknor. \"Serve 'un\nright for showing cheek to an honest English dog--\"\n\nBut I sent Ticknor backwards, with a push upon his breast, and then with\nboth hands I tugged at his brutal beast. As well might I have striven,\nthough I am not made of kid gloves, to pull an oak in its prime from the\nroot-hold. The harder I tugged the deeper went the bulldog's teeth, the\nfaster fell the gouts of red into his blazing eyes, and the feebler grew\nthe gasps of his exhausted victim. Then I picked up my ashen butt and\nbroke it on the backbone of the tyrant, but he never even yielded for\nthe rebate of a snarl. Death was closing over those magnificent brown\neyes, as they turned to me faintly their last appeal.\n\nA sudden thought struck me. I stood up for a moment, although I could\nscarcely keep my legs, and whipping out of my waistcoat my brother's\npatent box, I touched the spring and poured the whole contents into the\nbloody nostrils of that tenacious beast. Aha, what a change! His grim\nset visage puckered back to his very ears, as if he were scalped by\nlightning; the flukes of his teeth fell away from their grip, as an\nanchor sags out of a quicksand, he quivered all over, and rolled on his\nback, and his gnarled legs fell in on the drum of his chest, while he\ntried to scrub his squat nose in an agony of blisters. Then he rolled on\nhis panting side, and sneezed till I thought he would have turned all\nhis body inside out.\n\nAs for me, I set both hands upon my hips, though conscious of some pain\nin doing so, and laughed until the tears ran down my cheeks. My\nenjoyment was becoming actual anguish when the pensive Ticknor stooping\nover his poor pet inhaled enough of the superfluous snuff to send him\ndancing and spluttering across the meadow, vainly endeavouring between\nhis sneezes to make an interval for a heartfelt damn.\n\nBut suddenly this buffoonery received a tragic turn. From the door in\nthe ivied wall came forth a gliding figure well known to me, but not in\nits present aspect. The calm glory of the eyes was changed to grief and\nterror, the damask of the cheeks was blurred with tears, the sweet lips\nquivered with distress and indignation.\n\n\"Ah, _Kuban, Kuban_, Daretza, Dula, _Kuban_!\" This, or something like\nthis, was her melancholy cry, as she sank on her knees without a glance\nat us, and covered that palpitating golden form with a shower of dark\ntresses, waving with sobs like a willow in the breeze.\n\n\"Ah, _Kuban, Kuban_!\" and then some soft words uttered into his ear, as\nif to speed his flight.\n\nI ran to the brook and filled my hat with water, for I did not believe\nthat this great dog could be dead. When I came back the young lady was\nsitting with the massive head helpless on her lap, and stroking the soft\ndotted cheeks, and murmuring, as if to touch the conscience of Farmer\nTicknor, \"Ah, cruel, cruel! How men are cruel!\"\n\n\"Allow me one moment,\" I said, for she seemed not even to know that I\nwas near. \"Be kind enough to leave the dog to me. I may be able yet to\nsave his life. Do you understand English, Mademoiselle?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_'Allow me one moment,' I said._\"]\n\n\"His life, it is gone?\" Another sob stopped her voice, as she put her\nlittle hand, where she thought his heart must be. \"Yes, sir, I\nunderstand English too well.\"\n\n\"Then if you will be quick, we may save his life yet. I am used to dogs;\nthis noble fellow is not dead; though he will be very soon, unless we\nhelp him. There is a wound here that I cannot bind up with anything I\nhave about me. Bring bandages and anything long and soft. Also bring\nwool, and a pot of grease, and a sponge with hot water, and a bowl or\ntwo. I will not let him die, till you come back!\"\n\n\"If that could be trusted for, when would I come back?\" She glanced at\nme, having no time to do more, with a soft thrill of light, such as hope\nwas born in; and before I could answer it she was gone, leaving me\nunable to follow with my eyes; for it was the turning-point of _Kuban's_\nlife--if that were the name of this high-souled dog. The throttling was\ngone, and the barbed strangulation, and devil's own tug at his windpipe;\nbut the free power of breath was not restored, and the heart was\nscarcely stirring. Lifting his eyelids, I saw also that there was\nconcussion of the brain to deal with; but the danger of all was the\nexhaustion.\n\nLuckily in the breast-pocket of my coat was a little silver flask with a\ncup at the bottom, Tom Erricker's present on my last birthday. I had\nfilled it with whiskey, though I seldom took spirits in those young\ndays, but carried this dram in case of accidents, when fishing. Instead\nof dashing cold water out of my hat on the poor dog's face, as I had\nmeant to do,--which must in such a case have been his last sensation,--I\npoured a little whiskey into the silver cup, and filled it with the\nresidue of water that was leaking quickly from my guaranteed felt. Then\nI held up the poor helpless head, and let the contents of the cup\ntrickle gently over the black roots of the tongue. Down it went, and a\nshort gurgle followed, and then a twitch of the eyelids, and a long soft\ngasp. The great heart gave a throb, and the brown eyes looked at me,\nand a faint snort came from the flabby nostrils, and I shouted aloud,\n\"_Kuban_ is saved.\"\n\nThere was nobody to hear me, except the dog himself, and he was too weak\nto know what I meant. Ticknor was gone, with that beast at his heels,\nfor at the end of the meadow I saw _Grab_, the British champion,\nslouching along, like a vanquished cur, with his ropy stomach venting\nheavy sneezes; and to the credit of his wisdom, I may add that even a\nlamb in that valley ever after was sacred from a glance of his\nbloodthirsty goggles.\n\nWith his long form laid between my legs, while I sat down on the sod and\nnursed him, my wounded dog began more and more to recover his\nacquaintance with the world, and to wonder what marvel had befallen him.\nHe even put out his tongue, and tried to give me a lick, and his grand\ntail made one or two beats upon the ground; but I held up my hand, for\nhe had several frightful wounds, and he laid down his ears with a\ngrateful little whine. For the main point was to keep him quite still\nnow, until the dangerous holes could be stopped from bleeding.\n\nSo intent was I upon doing this, that before I was at all aware of it,\nthree or four people were around me. But I had eyes for only one, the\nlovely mistress of the injured dog; while she for her part had no\nthought whatever of anything, or any one, except that blessed _Kuban_.\nThat was right enough of course, and what else could be expected? Still\nI must admit that this great fellow rose even higher in my estimation,\nwhen he showed that he knew well enough where to find the proper course\nof treatment, and was not to be misled even by the warmest loyalty into\nfaith in feminine therapeutics.\n\n\"He has turned his eyes away from me. Oh, _Kuban, Kuban_! But I care not\nwhat you do, beloved one, if only you preserve your life. Do you think\nthat he can do that, sir, with all these cruel damages?\"\n\nNow that she was more herself, I thought that I had never heard any\nmusic like her voice, nor read any poetry to be compared to the\nbrilliant depths of her expressive eyes. And the sweetness of her voice\nwas made doubly charming by the harsh and high tones of her attendants,\nwho were jabbering in some foreign tongue, probably longing to\ninterfere, and take the case out of my management.\n\n\"If they would not make such a noise,\" I said, \"it would be all the\nbetter for my patient. Can you persuade them to stand out of my light,\nand let the fresh air flow in upon us? Oh, thank you, that is a great\ndeal better. There! I think now if we let him rest a minute, and then\ncarry him home, he will be all right. How clever you must be, to bring\nthe right things so well!\"\n\nFor this bit of praise I was rewarded with a smile more lovely than I\nshould have thought possible, since the fair cheeks of Eve took the\nfatal bite, and human eyes imbibed Satan. But she was truthful, as Eve\nwas false.\n\n\"Without Stepan I could have done nothing. Stepan, come forth, and\nreceive the praise yours. You must now take _Kuban_ in your arms, and\nfollow this gentleman into the fort. Understand you? He has very little\nEnglish yet. He can do everything except learn. Stepan is too strong for\nthat. But he has not the experience that I have. Nevertheless, he is\nvery good. I am praising thee, oh, Stepan. Lose not the opportunity of\nthanking me.\"\n\nStepan, a huge fellow, dressed very wonderfully according to my present\nideas, stood forth in silence, and held up his arms, to show that they\nwere ready for anything. But I saw that a hard leather bandoleer, or\nsomething of that kind, with a frill of leather cases, hung before his\ngreat chest, and beneath the red cross which all of them were wearing.\n\"Stepan is strong as the ox,\" said the lady.\n\nThat he might be, and he looked it too. \"Can he pull off that great\nleather frill?\" I asked, seeing that it would scrub the poor dog sadly,\nas well as catch and jerk his bandages.\n\n\"He cannot remove it. That is part of Stepan.\" His young mistress smiled\nat him, as she said this.\n\n\"Then put him up here,\" I said, holding out my arms, though not sure\nthat I could manage it, for the dog must weigh some twelve stone at\nleast, and one of my arms had been injured. Stepan lifted him with the\ngreatest ease; but not so did I carry him, for he must be kept in one\nposition, and most of his weight came on my bad arm. So difficult was my\ntask indeed, that I saw nothing of the place they led me through, but\nfeared that I should drop down at every rough spot--which would have\nmeant the death of poor _Kuban_. And down I must have come, I am quite\nsure of that, if I had not heard the soft sweet voice behind me--\"It is\ntoo much for the kind gentleman. I pray you, sir, to handle him to the\ngreat Stepan.\"\n\nWhen I was all but compelled to give in, by the failure of the weak arm,\nand the fear of dropping my patient fatally, a man of magnificent\nappearance stood before me, and saw my sad plight at a glance.\n\n\"Permit me,\" he said, in a deep rich tone, yet as gentle as a woman's\nvoice. \"This is over-trying your good will. I see what it is. I have\nonly just heard. I will bear him very gently. Take _Orla_ away.\"\n\nFor another dog was jumping about me now, most anxious to know what on\nearth had befallen that poor _Kuban_, and displaying, as I thought, even\nmore curiosity than sympathy. But when the weight was taken from me, and\nmy companions went on, I turned aside with pains and aches, which came\nupon me all the worse.\n\n\"I have done all I can. I am wanted no more; the sooner I get home the\nbetter.\"\n\nThinking thus I made my way towards the black door of our entrance, now\nstanding wide open in the distance; and I felt low at heart through the\nfailure of my strength, and after such a burst of excitement.\n\n\"I am not wanted here. I have no right here. What have I to do with\nthese strange people?\" I said to myself, as I sat for a moment to\nrecover my breath, on a bench near the door. \"I have quite enough to do\nat home, and my arm is very sore. They evidently wish to live in strict\nseclusion; and as far as concerns me, so they may. If they wanted me,\nthey would send after me. A dog is more to them than a Christian\nperhaps. What on earth do they wear those crosses for?\"\n\nI would not even look around, to see what sort of a place it was; but\nslipped through the door, and picked up my shattered rod and half-filled\ncreel, and set off, as the dusk was deepening, on the long walk to my\nfather's cottage.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHROUGH THE CORN\n\n\nAccording to Farmer Bandilow (who was now our last old tenant, striving\nto escape from the wreck of plough, by paddling with spade and trowel),\nthe London season begins with turnip-tops, and ends with cabbage-grubs.\nBut this year it must have lasted well into the time of turnip-bottoms;\notherwise how could my sister, Lady Fitzragon, have been in London? Not\nthat we knew very much about the movements of her ladyship, for she\nfound our cottage beyond the reach of her fat and glittering horses;\nonly that she must have been now in town, because our Grace was with\nher. And this was a lucky thing for me; for if Grace had been at home,\nshe must have known all about my wounded arm, and a nice fuss she would\nhave made of it. But my mother, though equally kind and good, was not\nvery quick of perception; and being out of doors nearly all the day now,\nand keeping my own hours, I found it easy enough to avoid all notice and\nescape all questions. For the people at the cottage very seldom came to\nmy special den, the harness-room; and I kept my own little larder in\nwhat had once been a kennel close at hand, and my own little bed up a\nflat-runged ladder, and so troubled none but a sweetly deaf old dame.\nAnd this arrangement grew and prospered, whenever there was no Grace to\nbreak through it.\n\nHowever, there is no luck for some people. One night, when I felt sure\nthat all the cottage was asleep, I had taken off the bandages, and was\npumping very happily on my left forearm, where the flesh had been torn,\nwhen there in the stableyard before me, conspicuous in the moonlight,\nwith a blazing satin waistcoat, stood the only man who could do justice\nto it. For this gallant fellow had a style of his own, which added new\nbrilliance to the most brilliant apparel.\n\n\"Why, Tom,\" I cried, \"where on earth do you come from? I can't shake\nhands, or I shall spoil some of your charms. Why, you must have been\ndining with the governor. New togs again! What a coxcomb it is!\"\n\n\"Never would I have sported these, and indeed I would never have come\ndown at all, if I had known Grace was out of the way.\"\n\nHe was allowed to call her _Grace_ to me.\n\n\"How slow it is without her! But I say, old chap, what a frightful arm\nyou've got! Pitchfork again, I suppose\"--for I had received a scratch\nbefore--\"only ten times as bad. Why, you mustn't neglect this. You'll\nhave it off at the elbow, if you do. Why, even by this light--By Jove,\nwhat a whacking arm you've got! Why, it is twice the size of mine. I\ncould never have believed it. Let me pull off my coat, and show you.\"\n\n\"But you cannot want one the size of mine\"--I answered with a laugh, for\nit was thoroughly like Tom to fetch everything into his own person; \"you\ncould never put it into a waistcoat like that.\"\n\n\"George, you are an ass,\" was his very rude reply, and it seemed to ring\ninto me far beyond his meaning. \"My dear fellow, you will be, in your\nown parish, what nobody has seen anywhere,--a dead jackass,--if you go\non like this. There is a black stripe down your arm; the same as you see\non a 'mild-cured-haddy' when he shines by moonlight. What does that\nmean? Putrefaction.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" I replied, meaning his own words. \"I'll pump on you, waistcoat\nand all, my dear Tom, if you go on with this sort of rubbish.\" And yet I\nhad some idea that he might be right. But the worst--as I need not tell\nany strong young fellow--of the absurdities our worthy doctors try to\nscrew into us now--that a man must not draw the breath the Lord breathed\ninto him, for fear of myrio-mycelia-micro-somethings, neither dare to\nput his fork into the grand haunch of mutton which his Maker ordered\nhim to arise and eat--of all such infantile stuff the harm is this, that\nit makes a healthy man deride the better sense that is in them.\n\n\"Come to my hole, and have a smoke,\" I said to my dear friend. \"And mind\nyou, not a word about this scratch to my good people. To-morrow we shall\ncut our first field of wheat. Though it won't pay for cutting and\nbinding, Tom, the sight is as glorious as ever. What a pity for our\ndescendants, if we ever have any, to get no chance of ever seeing the\nnoblest sight of Old England! Come to this gate, and take a look. In a\nfew more years, there will be no such sight.\"\n\n\"Poetry is all very fine in its way,\" replied Tom, who had about as much\nas I possess, although he could make a hook and eye of rhyme sometimes.\n\"But the moon will go on all the same, I suppose; and she does most of\nour poetry.\"\n\nShe was doing plenty of it now, in silence, such as any man may feel,\nbut none can make another feel. We waited a minute or two by the gate,\ntill a white cloud veiled the quivering disc, and then all the lustre\nflowed softly to our eyes, like a sea of silver playing smoothly on a\nshore of gold.\n\n\"After all, love is rot,\" said Tom, carried away by larger beauty, after\nsome snub of the day before. \"I should like to see any girl who could\ncompare with that. And a man must be a muff who could look at this, and\nthen trouble his head about their stupid little tricks. Look at the\nbreadth of this, look at the depth of it! Why, it lifts one; it makes\none feel larger, George; that is the way to take things.\"\n\n\"Especially when some one has been making you feel small,\" I answered at\na venture, for I understood my friend; and this abstract worship of\nbeauty was not so satisfactory to me now. \"But come into my place, and\ntell me all about it, my dear Tom. You were so mysterious the other day,\nthat I knew you were after some other wild goose.\"\n\n\"I am happy, most happy,\" Tom went on to say, after pouring forth the\nsorrows of his last love-tale, through many a blue eye and bright curl\nof smoke; \"I feel that I cannot be thankful enough at the amount of\nside that girl puts on. And the beauty of it is, that she hasn't got a\nrap, and her husband would have to help to keep her mother. How lucky\nfor me she never can have heard of the glorious Tinman, or my oofy\nmaiden-aunt; wouldn't she have jumped at me, if she had? A fellow can't\nbe too careful, George, when you come to think. But you'll never make a\nfool of yourself. Not a bit of romance about you, Farmer Jarge; and a\nfellow of your size and family has a right to go in for ten thousand\na-year. How about those gipsies in the valley, though? You mustn't go on\nwith that, even if you could, my friend. Great swells, I daresay, but no\ntin.\"\n\n\"What business of yours? What do you know about them? I'll thank you to\nhold your tongue upon subjects that are above you.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha! Ho, ho! Tinmen must look up to tinkers, must they? How dare I\ncall them tinkers? Well, it is just like this. These people are gipsies,\nall gipsies are tinkers, therefore these people are tinkers. But don't\nget in a wax, George. I was only chaffing. It may be Cleopatra herself,\nfor all I know, come to look after her needle--would not look at it,\nwhile her own, will look at nothing else, when lost. Oh, I know what\nwomen are.\"\n\n\"And I know what idiots are,\" I answered with a superior smile; not\nbeing quite such a fool, I trust, as to pretend to that knowledge which\neven the highest genius denies to man. \"And an idiot you are to-night,\nTom.\"\n\n\"Well, I may be a little upset,\" said he, striking his glorious\nwaistcoat, and then stroking it to remove the mark. \"I confess I did\nlike that girl. And she liked me; I am sure of that. Why, bless her\nlittle heart, she cried, my boy! However, it was not to be. And when I\ntold her that I must look higher (meaning only up to heaven) for gradual\nconsolation, what a wax she did get in! Never mind. Let it pass. There\nare lots of pretty girls about. And no man can be called mercenary, for\nI am blest if any of them have got a bit of tin. I thank the Lord, every\nnight of my life, that my old aunt never was a beauty. And that makes\nher think all the more of me. Sir, your most obedient!\"\n\nBehind my chair was an old looking-glass, which Grace had insisted upon\nhanging there, to make the place look rather smart; and Tom, who had not\nseen himself for some hours, stood up before it in the weak\ncandle-light, and proceeded in his usual manner. \"Tom, my friend, you\ndon't look so much amiss. If your heart is broken, there is enough of it\nleft to do a little breaking on its own account. Don't be cast down, my\nboy. You may not be a beauty, though beautiful girls think better of you\nthan your modesty allows you to proclaim. But one thing you may say,\nTom; whoever has the luck to get you, will find you a model husband.\"\n\nThis I thought likely enough; if only he should get a wife with plenty\nof sense and love to guide him. But what was the opinion of a tall, hard\nman who stood in the doorway with a long gun on his arm, criticising\nErricker's sweet self-commune with a puzzled and yet a very\nwell-contented gaze?\n\n\"Mr. Stoneman!\" I exclaimed, giving Tom a little push, for he stood with\nhis back to him, in happy innocence of critics. \"We did not expect this\npleasure so late at night. This is an old friend of mine--Mr. Erricker.\nAllow me to introduce you, Tom, to Mr. Jackson Stoneman.\" My old friend\nturned round, without a symptom of embarrassment, and bowed almost as\ngracefully as he had been salaaming to himself.\n\n\"I have heard of Mr. Erricker, and have great pleasure in making his\nacquaintance,\" our new visitor replied, and I saw that the pleasure was\ngenuine, and knew why; to wit, that he was thinking in his heart, \"That\nlittle fop to make up to Grace Cranleigh!\" For no doubt he had heard of\nTom's frequent visits, and the inference drawn by neighbours. \"But I\nmust beg pardon,\" he continued, \"for daring to look in at such a time.\nIt was only this, I have been down to the pond at the bottom of the long\nshrubbery, to look for some shoveller ducks I heard of, and see that no\npoachers are after them. I don't want to shoot them, though I brought my\ngun; and going back, I happened to see your light up here.\"\n\n\"Sit down, Mr. Stoneman,\" said Tom, as if he were the master of the\nplace. \"I have often wished to see you, and I will tell you why. I am a\nbit of a sportsman, when I can get the chance. But this fellow,\nCranleigh, is so hard at work always that he never will come anywhere to\nshow me where to go.\"\n\n\"And he has not many places to take you to now.\" I spoke without\nthinking, for to beg permission from this new landowner was about the\nlast thing I would do. And I was vexed with my friend for his\neffrontery.\n\n\"Of course I should never dream,\" proceeded Tom, for he had some reason\nin him after all, \"to ask leave to shoot on any land of yours, or where\nyou have taken the shooting rights. But there is a little warren with a\nlot of rabbits, on Bandilow's farm, where Sir Harold gives me leave. But\nI must go a mile round to get at it, unless I may cross the park with my\ngun. May I do so, without firing, of course?\"\n\n\"To be sure. As often as you like. Any friend of Mr. Cranleigh may do\nmuch more than that. And I am come to ask a favour, too. I have three\nfellows doing next to nothing. They have just finished bundling a lot of\nfurze. Capital fellows with a hook, I believe; and so I don't want to\nturn them off. I hear you intend to begin reaping to-morrow. Can you\nfind a job for them, just for a few days?\"\n\nThis was a very pretty way to put it. I knew that he had plenty of work\nfor the men, but wanted to help us with our harvest labour, having\nheard, no doubt, that we were short of hands. I thanked him warmly, for\nthese men would be of the greatest service to us. And then he turned\nupon me severely, as if my health were under his superintendence, and I\nwas trying to elude it, by keeping my arm from his notice.\n\n\"You are doing a very stupid thing. You have a shocking wound in your\nleft arm, caused by the tooth or the claws of a dog; and instead of\nhaving it treated properly, all you do is to pump upon it.\"\n\n\"Halloa!\" cried Tom Erricker, \"a dog. I wouldn't have that for a\nthousand pounds. George, how could you play me such a trick? You told me\nit was a pitchfork.\"\n\n\"I told you nothing of the kind. I simply said nothing whatever about\nit. It can concern nobody but myself. And I will thank Mr. Stoneman, and\nyou, too, to attend to your own business.\"\n\n\"It may be no business of mine, perhaps,\" the stockbroker answered\nseverely; \"but it is the undoubted business of any intimate friend of\nyours, and most of all that of your family. Such behaviour of yours is\nnot true manliness, as I daresay you suppose, but foolhardy\nrecklessness, and want of consideration for your friends. And what does\nthat come to but selfishness, under one of its many disguises?\"\n\nTom chimed in to the same effect, even going so far as to ask me what my\nfather and mother could do without me, even if they survived the trial\nof seeing me smothered under a feather-bed. But when both my friends had\nkilled me of rabies to their entire satisfaction, I showed them in very\nfew words how little they knew about what they were talking of. For I\nhad done for myself all that could be done, as well as any doctor could\nhave managed it, and now there was nothing for it but cold water, and an\neasy mind, and trust in Providence.\n\nAs soon as Tom Erricker heard of Providence, he began to yawn, as if he\nwere in church; so I begged him to go to bed, for which he was quite\nready, while I had a little talk with our tenant.\n\n\"How did you hear of this affair?\" I asked, hoping for some light upon\nother matters; \"none of our people know it. They make such a fuss about\na dog-bite, that I was obliged to keep it close. I will beg you to do\nthe same, if you wish to oblige me.\"\n\n\"There is nothing I wish for more than that.\" Stoneman drew his chair\nover as he spoke, and offered me one of his grand cigars; and I was not\nabove accepting it, with my knowledge of his feelings. \"I have your\npermission to call you _George_. I will do so, now that your bright\nyoung friend is gone. When I think of the reports that reached me--but I\nwill say no more. A fine young fellow, no doubt, or he would not be a\nfriend of yours.\" The vision of Tom Erricker at the mirror brought a\nsmile to his firm lips; but for my sake he suppressed it. \"Now I want to\ntalk to you seriously, George. And you will not take it as a liberty,\nknowing my very warm regard for--for you.\"\n\n\"You may say what you like. I shall take it kindly. I am well aware that\nyou know a thousand times as much of the world as I do.\"\n\n\"And a very poor knowledge it is,\" he replied, gazing at a cloud of his\nown smoke. \"When the question is of deeper matters, the wisdom of the\nworld is a broken reed. And yet I want to bring it into play just now.\nIn the case of another, that is so much easier; just as any fool can\npass judgment on the labour he has never tried with his own hand. Excuse\nme, George, if I speak amiss, I do it out of good-will, as some of them\ndo not, but to show their own superiority. To cut the matter short--I\nknow all about--no, not all, but a lot about your new friends down in\nthe valley.\"\n\n\"They can scarcely be called my friends, if I require to be informed\nabout them.\" My mind had been full of them, although it was clear that\nthey cared not to hear any more of me.\n\n\"You are surprised, perhaps, at my knowledge of what occurred the other\nday. That was by the purest accident; for I am not the sort of man to\nplay the spy. You know that, I hope. Very well, I took the liberty then\nof inquiring for my own sake, and that of the neighbourhood, who these\nmysterious settlers were, and I knew where to go for my information.\nLike most things, when you get nearer to them, there is no real mystery\nat all. The only wonder is that they can have been there so long,\nwithout attracting notice. If the country had been hunted, as it used to\nbe, when people could afford to keep up the pack, they would never have\nbeen left so quiet. The parson of the parish, as a general rule, routs\nup every newcomer for church purposes, no matter what his creed may be;\nand I know that they seldom give much start even to the tax-collectors.\nBut the parson of that parish is a very old man, and has no one to look\nafter him, and the country is very thinly peopled. Well, they seem to\nhave bought the place for an old song, so that nobody can interfere with\nthem. And they soon put it into better order--\"\n\n\"But who are they? And what are they doing there? And how long do they\nmean to stop?\"\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry, my good friend. There is plenty of time for\nanother cigar. Pipes you prefer? Very well, fill again. However, for\nfear of being knocked on the head, I will resume my parable. Nothing can\nbe done without paying for it. That is the golden rule in England, and\neverywhere else upon this planet. And wherever money passes, it can be\nfollowed up. The strange thing is that these people seem to care very\nlittle about concealment, though they are not sociable. What their\nnative language is, we do not know, though they seem to be great\nlinguists. French, German, Russian, Arabic, and I don't know what else,\nand some of them very good in our beloved tongue, the hardest to learn\nof all the lot. They are of Eastern race, that appears quite certain,\nthough neither Jews, Turks, nor Armenians. But what they are here for\nseems pretty plain--forgery!\"\n\n\"Ridiculous!\" I exclaimed, though without showing any wrath. \"They are\npeople of high rank, I am sure of that. Political exiles, refugees,\nAnarchists, or even Nihilists--though I cannot think that. But as for\nforgers--\"\n\n\"It scarcely sounds nice; and yet I have little doubt about it; and the\npolice have come to that conclusion, and are keeping a sharp eye upon\nthem. For what other purpose can they want a mill? And a mill which they\nhave set up themselves, to suit themselves. The old water-wheel they\nhad, and the cogs and all that, left from the old corn-grinding time;\nbut they have refitted it for quite a different purpose, and done almost\nall of it with their own hands. What for? Plain as a pikestaff--to make\ntheir own paper, and get stamping power, and turn out forged notes,\nforeign of course, Russian rouble, the simplest of all.\"\n\nHe had made up his mind. He was sure of this solution. He had no doubt\nwhatever. Ah, but he had never seen the majestic man who met me, much\nless that beautiful nymph of the shrine!\n\n\"Stoneman, all this sounds very fine.\" I met his smile of confidence,\nand as it seemed to me of heartless triumph, with a gaze of faith in\nhumanity--which some people might call romance. \"But there is not a word\nof truth in it. What inference does a policeman draw? The worst he can\nimagine--grist for his own mill. They make the world a black chapter, to\nsuit their own book. But I have no motive. What motive could I have, to\nmake out that people are better than they seem? I tell you, and you may\ntake my word for it, that this little colony, of whatever race it may\nbe, has no evil purpose in coming among us. I might even go further and\nsay that I am sure of their having an excellent object, a noble object,\nsome great discovery, perhaps surpassing all my brother's, and something\nthat will be of service to entire humanity.\"\n\n\"Money, to wit. You know what the last great forger who was hanged,\nbefore we left off that wise plan, what he said when exhorted to\nrepentance, 'You make money for yourself, sir, I make it for the good of\nthe public.' No doubt they take that view of the case.\"\n\n\"Very well, you take a lesson from them, and improve the morals of the\nStock Exchange.\"\n\nThe stockbroker smiled very pleasantly, as one who was thoroughly at\nhome with that old joke; then he took up his gun, and marched off for\nthe Hall, leaving me to make the best of things.\n\nFeeling how small are the minds of mankind, even the best of them, when\nthey listen to the police, and knowing that I could not sleep as yet, I\nwent once more to the gate at the top of the yard, and gazed over the\nwheat which was to lie low on the morrow. Although I had just received\nproof of friendship, from two very nice fellows better than myself,\nwhich should have encouraged me to think the best, sadness came into my\nheart, and a sombre view of life depressed me. There are two things only\nthat can save a man from deep dejection occasionally. One of them is to\nhave no thought whatever, except for affairs of the moment; and the\nother and surer is to believe with unchangeable conviction that all is\nordered by a Higher Power, benevolent ever, and ever watchful for those\nwho commit themselves to it. That atom of humanity, which is myself, has\nnever been able to sink to the depth of the one condition, or soar to\nthe height of the other. So there must be frequent ups and downs with\nordinary mortals, gleams of light, and bars of shade; and happy is the\nman who can keep the latter from deepening as his steps go on. But who\nam I to moralise?\n\nEnough that any fellow worth his salt must be grieved and lowered, when\nsuspicions arise, concerning those of whom he has formed a high opinion.\nHow much worse, when his own judgment owns that things look rather\nblack, and memory quotes against his wishes more than one such\ndisappointment. If it were so, if those who had made so deep an\nimpression on me were skulking rogues and stealthy felons, no wonder\nthey had not cared to ask what became of the stranger, who by remarkable\npresence of mind had saved the life of their valued warder, and then\nwith a modesty no less rare, had vanished before they could thank him,\nif they ever had the grace to intend it. \"All the better,\" I said to\nmyself, with the acumen of the wisest fox that ever entered vineyard,\n\"even if all had been right, it never could have led to any good; and\nsee what a vast amount of work is coming on all at once, with no one\nelse to do it! And all the time is there any one but myself to see to my\nyoung sister's doings? Here is this fellow Stoneman sweet upon her,\nwonderfully sweet, quite spoony--who could have believed it of a\nstockbroker? What do I know about him? Nothing, except that he has\nendless tin, and spends it certainly like a brick. Is he worthy of her,\nand if he is, will she even look at him? Rather a romantic girl, too\nfond of her own opinions, and yet a little prone to hero-worship. She\nmight fall in love with some hero in London who hasn't got a\nhalf-penny--halloa, what can that be, winding in and out so, through the\nwheat?\"\n\nThe moon, now very nearly full, was making that low round of the sky\nwhich is all it can manage in August, and seemed rather to look along\nthe field than heartily down upon it. The effect was very different now\nfrom that which Tom and I had watched. For the surface of the luxuriant\ncorn, instead of imbibing and simpering with light, was flawed and\npatched (like a flowing tide) with flittings and hoverings of light and\nshade. And along a sweep of darkness near the shadow of a tree, there\nwas something moving stealthily like the figure of a man.\n\nFor a moment or two, I did not enjoy that calmness of mind which is\nbelieved (by Britons) to be the prerogative of Britons. The period of\nthe night, and the posture of the moon, and peculiar tone of things not\nto be told, as well as some dread of a mischief to my brain--through\nwhat had befallen me recently--took away from me that superior gift\nwhich had enabled me to beat the bull-dog. However, I might just as well\nnot have been afraid--as we generally find out afterwards--for the other\napparition, whatever it might be, was ever so much more afraid of me.\n\n\"What on earth are you about there?\" I shouted bravely, when this\nwelcome truth came to my knowledge. \"Can't you stand up like a man, and\nsay what you are about?\"\n\nIn reply to my challenge an undersized figure scarcely any taller than\nthe corn arose, showing a very strange head-dress and other outlandish\ngarments, and a loose idea generally of being all abroad. \"You are the\nlittle chap I saw the other day,\" said I.\n\nHe nodded his head, and said something altogether outside of my\nclassical attainments; and then he pulled forth from a long coat, whose\ncolours no moon, or even rainbow could render, a small square package,\nwhich he lifted to his eyes. With a rush of my heart into the situation,\nI seized him by his collar, or the thing that represented it, and\ntwisted him over the gate; and he looked thankful, having some fear\nperhaps of English five-bars.\n\nIn half a minute, I had this little fellow in my den, where he trembled\nand blinked at the light, and then grinned, as if to propitiate a\ncannibal. And I was pleased to see that he had pluck enough to put one\nhand upon the hilt of a little blue skewer which he wore in his belt,\nand then he looked at me boldly. With a smile to reassure him, I offered\nto take the missive from his other hand. But that was not the proper\nstyle of doing business with him. He drew back for a pace or two, and\nmade the utmost of his puny figure, and then with a low bow stretched\nforth both hands, and behold there was a letter in the end of a cleft\nstick! Where he found the cleft stick is more than I can tell. At the\nsame time, he said _Allai_, which turned out afterwards to be his own\nname.\n\n\"Sit down in that corner, little chap,\" I said as graciously as if he\nknew English. \"And make yourself at home, while I get on with this.\"\nPerhaps he was out of practice in the art of sitting down, for instead\nof accepting the chair I offered, he clapped himself in some wonderful\nmanner upon a hassock. But it was impossible for me to attend to him\nmuch, until I knew what he had brought.\n\nNow there was nothing particularly foreign about this. It looked like an\nordinary English letter, except that the paper was not like ours, and\nthe envelope was secured with silk, as well as sealed. But the writing\nwas the daintiest that ever I did see; and I longed to get rid of that\n\"darkie\" in the corner, whose eyes flashed at me from the gloomy floor.\nAnd his hand was playing with his _kinjal_ all the time, for so they\ncall those deadly bits of steel, without which they never think their\nattire complete. Being unaccustomed to be looked at so, I could not\nenter into my fair letter as I wished; though that little fellow would\nhave flown up to the slates, before he could get near me with that\nhateful snakish thing. And to tell the truth, I did him wrong by any\nsuch suspicion; for there could never be a more loyal, honest, and\nzealous retainer than Allai. \"Here you are,\" I said, addressing him in\nEnglish, though well aware now that he was none the wiser; \"here's a\ndrop of good beer for you, young man. You take a pull at that, while I\nwrite my answer. Ah, you won't get such stuff as that in--well, I don't\nknow where you hail from; but all over the world I defy you to get\nanything like it.\"\n\nAllai gave a grunt which I took for acquiescence; and leaving him to\nenjoy himself, I wrote a few lines and enclosed them in a cover. Then I\nfound a bit of sealing wax, and sealed it very carefully, and fixed it\nin the cleft wand, and handed it to Allai.\n\n\"You go straight away, quick-sticks, with this, and don't you lose it,\nor I'll break your neck. Why, I'm blest if the pagan has drunk a drop of\nhis beer! Can such a race ever be brought up to date? Why, he takes it\nfor virulent poison!\"\n\nThe young savage had poured my good ale upon the floor, and was soaking\nthe point of his dagger in it. He had put the glass to his lips no\ndoubt, and arrived at the sage conclusion that here was swift death for\nhis enemies. However, he possessed some civilisation as to the meaning\nof a broad crown-piece, which in the fervour of my joy I set before him.\nTo a rich man it would have been well worth the money, to see the glad\nsparkle of those black eyes, and the grin upon those swarthy cheeks.\nSuddenly with a deep salaam his slender form turned and was gone like a\nshadow.\n\nAnd then I was able at last to dwell upon this very beautiful letter,\nwhich might to the outward eye appear to convey not a token of anything\nmore than \"Miss Mary Jones presents her compliments;\" but to my deeper\nperception, and hopes higher than any telescope may carry, it showed the\nsky cast open at the zenith, like a lily, and a host of golden angels\nletting down a ladder for me. For no longer could I hide my state of\nmind, or disguise it from myself. Henceforth I shall be open about it,\nthough hitherto ashamed to say half of what I thought, while I had such\na little to go upon. But here is my key to Paradise. Let every man judge\nfor himself, bearing in mind that he never can be wise until he has been\na fool seventy times seven.\n\n\n     \"SIR,--My dear father, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, of Daghestan, has been injured\n     very greatly by your alien conduct to him. Your actions were of\n     high bravery, and great benevolence to us. But when we desired very\n     largely to inform you of our much gratitude, we could not discover\n     you in any place, and we sought for you vainly, with great\n     eagerness of sorrow. And then, for a long space of time, we made\n     endeavour to find out the name of the gentleman who had done us so\n     great a service, but would not permit us to thank him. We are\n     strangers here, and have not much knowledge. After that, a man who\n     possesses three goats pronounced to us that he understood the\n     matter. According to his words, I take the liberty of letter,\n     entreating you, if it is right, to come, and permit us to see to\n     whom we owe so much. And my father is afraid that the gentleman was\n     injured in the conflict with a furious English beast. If, then,\n     this should have happened, he can remedy it, as perhaps you cannot\n     in this country. I desire also, if it is right, to join my own\n     entreaties. I am, Sir, Yours very faithfully,\n\n     DARIEL.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nSTRANGE SENSATIONS\n\n\n\"Yours very faithfully.\" Oh, if that were only written in earnest,\ninstead of cold convention! To have, faithfully mine, the most lovely,\nand perfect, entrancing, enslaving, poetical, celestial--tush, what word\nis there in our language? None of course; because there has never been\nanything like it until now. Gentleness, sweetness, gracefulness, purity,\nsimplicity, warmth of heart, gratitude for even such a trifling\nservice--all these were very fine things in their way; but away with\nthem all, if they want to tell me why I love my darling! Because I\ncannot help it, is the only reason. It must be so, because it is so.\nSurely this is their own fair logic, and they must feel the force of it.\n\nAll this jumped with reason well, and was plainer than a pikestaff. But\nthe path of true love still was crossed by one little bar, without a\nsign-post. In the name of the zodiac, where was Daghestan?\n\nMan had not quite hatched board-schools yet; though already, under the\ntread of Progress, incubating of them. Having been only at a public\nschool, and then for two years at Oxford, no opportunity had I found for\nhearing of Modern Geography. That such a thing existed, I could well\nbelieve, from the talk of undergraduates, whose lot it was to cram for\ncompetition of a lower kind. I had been a prefect at Winchester, and\npassed my little-go at Oxford, and might have gone in for honours there,\nthough very likely not to get them. But in all this thoroughly sound\neducation, I had never dreamed of Modern Geography. I could have told\nyou, though it is all gone now, the name of every village in\nPeloponnese, and of every hill in Attica, and the shape of every bay and\nisland, and a pestilent lot of them there was, from the Hellespont to\nT\u00c3\u00a6narus. But if you had asked me the names and number of the counties of\nEngland, and other wild questions of that sort, I should have answered,\nas a friend of mine did, who got an open scholarship at Oxford, and then\nwent in for something in London, \"There are about half a hundred, more\nor less; but Parliament is always changing them.\" And this man got the\nhighest marks in the geography of that year; because the examiner was a\nWelshman, and therefore laid claim to Monmouth.\n\nBut wherever Daghestan might be, I felt sure of its being the noblest\ncountry (outside the British dominions) of all the sun could shine upon.\nMoreover, it sounded as if it had no little to do with the Garden of\nEden. Ispahan, and Teheran, and other rhymes for caravan, had a gorgeous\noriental sound, as of regions of romance, inhabited by Peris, and paved\nwith gold and diamonds. And the glow that flickered through the wheat\nthat day, as the mellow fountains danced before the blue half-moon of\nsickle, was warmer than an English sun can throw, and quickened with a\nbrilliance of heavenly tints, such as Hope alone, the Iris of the heart,\nmay cast.\n\n\"Farmer Jarge, here's nuts for you. What do you suppose I have found out\nnow?\"\n\nThis was that lazy fellow Tom, sprawling in the yellow stubble, with his\nback against a stook, and a pipe in his mouth, and a dog's-eared novel\non his lap. We had knocked off work for half an hour in the middle of\nthe day, just to get a bit to eat; and I was not best pleased with\nErricker, because of the difference between the noble promise of the\nbreakfast table, and the trumpery performance in the field.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Sprawling in the yellow stubble._\"]\n\n\"Get away,\" I said; \"you can talk, and nothing else. All you have found\nout is where the beer-can is; you are not even worthy of your bread and\ncheese.\" However, I gave him some, and he began to munch.\n\n\"Won't you laugh, when I tell you about this? And it upsets all your\ntheories that you are so wonderfully wise with. I must have heard you\nsay a thousand times, that it is only a fool that ever falls in love.\"\n\n\"You never understand a thing that anybody says. There are limitations,\nand conditions, and a whole variety of circumstances, that may make all\nthe difference; otherwise a man would be a fool to talk like that.\"\n\n\"Fool to do it? Or fool to talk about it? You seem to be getting a bit\nmixed, friend George. It's the stooping that has done it. By Jove! I\ncouldn't stand that. Nature never meant me for a reaper, George. And you\nmay thank the Lord that I did not cut your legs off. But what do you\nthink 'Stocks and Stones' has done? And you can't call him a fool\naltogether. Head over heels, 'Stocks and Stones' has fallen in love with\nour Grace!\"\n\n\"_Our Grace_, indeed! Have you a sister of that name? If you should\nhappen to refer to my sister, I will thank you to call her 'Miss\nCranleigh'! Is there anything this fellow does not meddle with?\"\n\n\"Mr. George Cranleigh, Mr. Jackson Stoneman aspires to the hand of Miss\nGrace Cranleigh, daughter of Sir Harold Cranleigh, Bart. Is that grand\nenough, Mr. Cranleigh? And if so, what do you think of it?\"\n\nWhat I thought of it was that there scarcely could have been a more\nunlucky complication than was likely now to be brought about by Tom's\nconfounded discovery. It was not in his nature to hold his tongue; and\nif he should once let this knowledge escape him, in the presence of my\nfather and mother, or worst of all in that of my sister, it would be all\nup with Stoneman's chance of marrying Grace Cranleigh. And as to binding\nTom to secrecy, as well might one blow the kitchen bellows at a\ndandelion ball, and beg it not to part with a particle of its plumage.\nOn the spur of the moment, I said more than facts would bear me out in,\nwhen they came up at leisure.\n\n\"Don't tell me, you stupid fellow. How many more mare's nests must come\nout of your eyes, before you see anything? But if you must take in such\nrubbish, just do this, Tom, will you? Keep your eyes wide open, my boy.\nYou know how sharp you are, Tom. But not a word to any one, or it would\nspoil your game altogether. By the by, where is Daghestan, Tom? You are\nsuch a swell at geography.\"\n\n\"Daghestan! I seem to have heard of it, and yet I can't be certain.\nPersian, I think. No, that is Ispahan. Tut, tut, what a fool I am!--of\ncourse I know all about it. Why it's in the United States, a prime place\nfor scalping and buffaloes.\"\n\n\"No, you old muff, that is Dakota. Quite another pair of shoes. I don't\nwant to disturb the Governor, or I could find out in a moment. Never\nmind, it doesn't matter; and here we go to work again. Now what is the\nsweetest smell, do you think, in all the world of farming? Not a great\nover-powering scent, but a delicate freshness through the air.\"\n\n\"I should say the hay on an upland meadow, when it begins to make. Or\nperhaps a field of new bean-blossom. I never knew that till this year;\nbut upon my word it was stunning.\"\n\n\"No, the most delicate of all scents is from the clover first laid bare\namong the wheat where it was sown. No blossom of course; but the\nfragrance of the leaf, among the glossy quills that sheltered it. But\ncome along; if you can't swing hook without peril of manslaughter, you\ncan bind, or you can set up stooks, or earn your keep some little. Why,\nGrace is worth a score of you! Poor Tom, is your finger bleeding? You\nmust come harvesting in kid gloves.\"\n\n\"I will tell you what it is,\" said Tom, after keeping his place among\nthe binders for about five minutes. \"I am a thoroughgoing countryman,\nand I know a lot about farming; and you know how I can jump and run, and\na good light weight with the gloves I am; but this job beats me\naltogether. 'Pay your footing, sir, pay your footing!' You'll have to\npay for my headstone, George, if you keep me on much longer. How you can\ngo on all day long--but I want you to do something for me, and by the\nPowers, I have earned it.\"\n\nHe wanted me to promise, in return for all his labours, to give up my\nplans for the evening, and present myself at dinner-time for the\nceremony at the cottage. This, though a very simple business, must be\ndone in the proper form; and then it would be my duty perhaps to offer\nto take a hand at whist, and be ready for the wearisome wrangle, which\neven well-bred people make of it. But I had nobler fish to fry.\n\n\"Tom, I can't do it. You like that sort of thing; and my mother is\ndelighted with your sprightly little tales. Go and put your brave\napparel on. Everybody admires you; and you love that.\"\n\nHe knew that he did. Why should he deny it? The happiness of mankind is\npleasure, though it passes without our knowledge, because we never can\nstop to think of it,--as a man in a coach sees the hedges race by; and\nif it comes to that, where may you find true bliss so near at home, as\nin being pleased with your own good self? Our Tom had a happy time.\nNothing long tormented him. He carried a lofty standard with him, and\nflopped its white folds joyously at little gnats and buzzing bees; and\nhe never failed to come up to it, because that standard was himself.\n\"What else could it be?\" he says to me. \"And that is why everybody likes\nme.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nUPON THE GROUND\n\n\nAlas! to come down from those pleasant heights, if ever I did attain to\nthem, to the turbulent dissatisfaction with oneself, and contempt of\nevery creature in the world, save one, which lonely love engenders!\nNever had I seemed to myself so low, so awfully prosaic and\nunpicturesque, as when I was trying to make myself look decent that very\nevening. Since then I have learned that even pretty girls, who are roses\nto thistles in comparison with us, are never quite certain at their\nlooking-glass that another touch might not improve them. And what did I\nbehold? A square-built fellow, with a stubby yellow moustache, and a\nnose fit for the ring,--or to have a ring through it,--a great bulky\nforehead, like Ticknor's bull-dog, and cheeks like a roasted\ncoffee-berry. The only thing decent was the eyes, firm and strong, of a\nsteadfast blue, and the broad full chin that kept the lips from drooping\nin a tremble even now. Proud as I was of my Saxon breed, and English\nbuild and character, in the abasement of the moment I almost longed for\na trace of the comely Norman traits. \"As if any girl could love you!\" I\nexclaimed, in parody of that handsome Tom's self-commune.\n\nIn for a penny, in for a pound. Without a trial, there's no denial.\nHandsome is that handsome does. Beauty is only skin-deep. And so on--I\nlaboured to fetch myself up to the mark, but it was a very low one. The\nneap of the tide, or the low spring water,--which goes ever so much\nfurther out,--was ebbing away on the shores of self-esteem as I entered\nthe glen of St. Winifred. Tom Erricker would have descended, as if the\nvalley and its contents belonged to him. Heaviness of heart may\nsometimes visit even a healthy and robust young man, living the life\nintended for us, working in the open air all day, and sleeping on a hard\npalliasse at night. Heaviness and diffidence, and clownish hesitation,\nand fear of losing precious landmarks in a desert-dazzle. Surely it were\nbetter to turn back before they can have seen me, set the sheepish face\nto the quiet hill, and thank my stars that not one of them yet has\nturned into a comet.\n\nSadly was I perpending this, slower and slower at every step, while the\nshadows of the trees grew longer, and the voice of birds was lower, and\nthe babble of the brook began to sink into the lisping of a cradled\nchild, as the draught of the valley hushed it; and falling into harmony\nwith all these signs, my breath was beginning to abate me, when along a\ntrough of sliding mist like a trysting track for the dusk, appeared the\nform of my friend _Kuban_. Courage at once arose within me, and spirit\nof true patronage. To men and women I may be nought, but to him I am a\nhero. Lo, how he licks my hand, and whines, as if he had never seen my\nlike, and would never believe it, if he did! He longs to roll upon his\nback, and offer himself a prostrate sacrifice. But he knows that I\nshould be vexed at that, because it would not be safe for him. The\nlabour of his great heart is to show me all his damages, and make me\nunderstand that, but for me, he could not display them. What with love,\nand what with fear, and the utter unsettlement of my mind, down I went\non the grass beside him, and took him paw by paw, to feel how much of\nhim was still existing.\n\nNow if I had thought of it in the coldest blood--if there still were\ncold blood in me--there was nothing in the world I could have done so\nwise as this abasement. What says Ovid in the \"Art of Love\"? Many low\nthings, I am afraid, that no Englishman would stoop to. But if that\ngreat Master arose anew, to give lessons to an age of milder passion,\nprobably he would have said to me, \"Water those wounds with your tears,\nmy friend.\"\n\nMy eyes, being British, were dry as a bone; but upon them fell, as they\nlooked up, the lustre of a very different pair, like bright stars\nextinguishing a glow-worm. And the glory of these was deepened by the\nsuffusion of their sparkle with a tender mist of tears. No blush was\nlurking in the petal of the cheeks, no smile in the brilliant bud of\nlips; pity and gentle sorrow seemed to be the sole expression.\n\nI dropped the dog's great legs, and rose, and with all the grace that in\nme lay--and that was very little--took off my hat, and made a bow, the\nformer being of the bowler order, and the latter of the British.\n\n\"No, no. Please not to do that,\" she said, \"it is so very grievous.\nForgive me, if I am sad to look at. It always comes upon me so, when I\nbehold things beautiful.\"\n\n\"But,\" I replied, being quite unable to consider myself of that number,\neven upon such authority, \"it is I that should be shedding tears; it is\nI that behold things beautiful.\"\n\n\"It was of the dog I meant my words,\"--this was rather a settler for\nme,--\"and the beautiful tokens he manifests of gratitude to the kind\ngentleman. And we have been desiring always; but the place we could not\nfind. It is my father who will best speak, for he has great talent of\nlanguages. He was hoping greatly that you would come. I also have been\ntroubling in my mind heavily, that we must appear so ungrateful. It is\nnow ten days that have passed away. But we could not learn to what place\nto send; neither did we know the name of Mr.--but I will not spoil it,\nuntil you have told me how to pronounce.\"\n\n\"_Cranleigh, Cran-lee_; as if it were spelled with a double e coming\nafter the letter l,\" said I to her. While to my all abroad self I\nwhispered, \"May the kind powers teach her to spell it, by making it her\nown, while she looks like that.\"\n\nFor sometimes it is vain to think, and to talk is worse than lunacy. Her\nattitude and manner now, and her way of looking at me,--as if I were\nwhat she might come to like, but would rather know more about it,--and\nthe touches of foreign style (which it is so sweet to domicile), and the\nexquisite music which her breath made, or it may have been her lips,\nwith our stringy words--I am lost in my sentence, and care not how or\nwhy, any more than I cared how I was lost then, so long as it was in\nDariel's eyes.\n\nIf Dariel's eyes will find me there, and send me down into her heart,\nwhat odds to me of the earth or heaven, the stars, the sun, or the moon\nitself--wherein I am qualified to walk with her?\n\nPossibly that sweet Dariel saw, but could not comprehend my catastrophe.\nShe drew back, as if from something strange, and utterly beyond her\nknowledge. Then she cast down those eyes, that were so upsetting me; and\nI felt that as yet I had no right to perceive the tint, as of heaven,\nbefore the earth has glimpsed the dawn, which awoke in welcome wonder on\nthe wavering of her face. See it I did however, and a glow went through\nme.\n\nWho can measure time when time acts thus? _Kuban_ arose, as if his\nwounds were all a sham, or as if we at least were taking them in that\nlight, and hating--as a good dog always does--to play second fiddle,\nturned his eyes from one to the other of the twain, in a manner so\ntragic that we both began to laugh. And when Dariel laughed, there could\nbe nothing more divine, unless it were Dariel crying.\n\n\"Oh, how he does love you, Mr. Cran-lee!\" she exclaimed with a little\npout, pretending to be vexed. \"What a wicked dog he is to depart from\nhis mind so! Why, he always used to think that there was nobody like\nme.\"\n\n\"If he would only think that I am like you, or at any rate try to make\nyou like me, what a blessed animal he would be!\" This I said with\npathos, and vainly looking at her.\n\n\"I am not very strong of the English language yet. It has so many words\nthat are of turns incomprehensible. And when one thinks to have learned\nthem all, behold they are quite different! To you I seem to speak it\nvery, very far from native.\"\n\n\"To me you seem to speak it so that it is full of music, of soft clear\nsounds, and melody, that no English voice can make of it. It is like the\nnightingale I heard when first--I mean one summer evening long ago;\nonly your voice is sweeter.\"\n\n\"Is it? Then I am glad, because my father hears it always. And he knows\neverything I think, before I have time to tell him. And he can speak the\nEnglish well,--as well as those who were born in it. Seven different\nlanguages he can speak. Oh, how he is learned! To hear me talk is\nnothing--nothing--folly, trifles, nothing more than deficiency of\nwisdom, and yet of himself he thinks no more, perhaps not so much as you\ndo.\"\n\n\"I think nothing of myself at all. How can I, when I am with you? Yet a\ngreat many different people think highly of me, and I do my best to\ndeserve it.\" This was no vain word, although it is not like my usual\nmanner to repeat it.\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" she answered simply, looking with kind approval at\nme; and I saw that her own clear nature led her to believe everything\nshe heard. \"That is the proper way for people, and as the good Lord\nintended. But how long we have been discoursing, without anything to be\nsaid, while the dusk of the night is approaching! It is my father beyond\nall doubt whom you have come by this long road to see. And he has been\ndesiring for many days to obtain the privilege of seeing you; not only\nthat he may return his thanks, but to learn that you did not receive a\nwound; for he says that the wound of a dog is very dangerous in this\ncountry.\"\n\n\"Yes, I did receive a wound, and a bad one rather,\"--how mean of me it\nwas to speak like this! Although I was telling the simple truth, for\nthere was a deep gash all down my left forearm. \"But I would gladly\nreceive a hundred wounds, for the sake of anything that you loved. For\nwhat am I? Who could find any good in me, compared with you, or even\nwith _Kuban_?\"\n\nBut this fine appeal to the tender emotions did not obtain any success\nthat time. If the pity, so ignobly fished for, felt any tendency to\nmove, it took good care not to show itself in the fountains watched by\nme.\n\n\"Mr. Cran-lee speaks much from his good-will to please. For there must\nbe good in him, even to compare with _Kuban_, if a great many people\nthink highly of him, and he does his best to deserve it. But is it not\nthe best thing to hasten at once with this very bad wound to the one who\ncan cure it? Let us waste no more time, but go at once to meet my\nfather.\"\n\nThere was no getting out of this; and I said to myself that Miss Dariel\nwas not quite so soft after all. What had she told me about herself?\nNothing. How much about her father? Very little. And here was I being\ntowed off to him, when I wanted to talk with her, study her, make way\nwith her, find out whether there was any other villain in pursuit of her\nmarvellous attractions,--in a word, make my best love to her.\n\nBut this was the very thing she would not have at present; and I felt\nlike a man tumbling out of a tree, through making too lofty a grab at\nthe fruit. So I fell into the opposite extreme of manner, to make it\ncome home to her that I was hurt. This was another mistake; because, as\nI came to understand long afterwards, the feminine part of mankind is\nnever struck all of a heap, as we are. If you will only think twice, you\nwill see that it never could be expected. For drop as we may--and the\nladies too often call upon us now to drop it--the sense that is inborn\nin us, of a purer and higher birth in them, which they kept and exalted\nby modesty--even if at their own demand we let fall every atom of that,\nand endeavour to regard them as bipeds on a wheel, with limbs rounder\nthan our own,--I say that we ought to try still to regard them as better\nthan ourselves, though they will not have it so. And what could say more\nfor their modesty?\n\nI looked at Dariel, and saw that she was not thinking of me at all,\nexcept as a matter of business. And fearing to have gone too far, I\ntried to behave in every way as a well-conducted stranger. This put her\ninto a friendly state of mind, and even more than that. For it was now\nher place to be hospitable; and I displayed such bashfulness, that\nbelieving her father to be the greatest man on earth, she concluded that\nI was terribly afraid of him.\n\n\"You must not be uneasy about meeting him;\" she spoke in a voice as\ngentle as the whisper of the wind in May, when it tempts a young lamb to\nsay \"Ba!\" \"I assure you, Mr. Cran-lee, although he can be very stern\nwith persons at all wicked, to those who are upright and good, he is a\ngreat deal less austere and rigid than even I am. And I am afraid that\nyou have discovered much harshness in my character, for you appear to\ndread a walk with me.\"\n\nI had fallen behind as we approached the door, partly to show my\nhumility, and partly to admire the grace and true perfection of her\nslender figure in motion. English girls may have lovely figures, but\nnone of them can walk like that.\n\n\"No,\" I said after some delay, to make her turn her head again, and\nrepeat that look of penitence; \"you have been as kind as I could expect,\nperhaps more kind than the ladies of your country are to a mere\nstranger.\"\n\nIf ever I deserved a good hearty kick, and too often that has been my\nmerit, here was a solid occasion for it. She stopped and spread both\nhands to me, and looked at me with her clear chin raised, and trembling\nlips, and soft dark eyes, whose radiant depths appeared to thrill with\ntender sorrow and self-reproach. What eyes to tell the tale of love, to\nthe happy man who shall inspire it!\n\nNo dawn was there now of any warmth, but light alone, the light of\nkindliness and good-will, and the tranquil beams of gratitude. What more\ncould I expect as yet, though myself in such a hurry?\n\n\"What a beautiful place! I had no idea that it would be like this.\"\n\nI spoke as we stood within the wall, for the maiden now seemed timid.\n\"Why, I must have lost my wits altogether, when I was here the other\nday, for I do not remember a bit of this. What a wonderful man your\nfather is! What taste, and skill, and knowledge! But it must have taken\nhim many years to bring it into this condition. It was nothing but a\npile of ruins, inside an old ruinous wall, at the time when I used to\ncome home from Winton. And how beautifully it is laid out! I should like\nto know who planned it. Why you must have quite a number of men to keep\nit in such order. It is almost like a dream to me. But how rude I must\nappear to you! Though really if the light were good, I could sit here\nfor an hour together and like to look at nothing else but all this\nperfect loveliness.\"\n\nShe had come quite close to me as I spoke, with a bright smile of\npleasure on her face,--for I warmed my description knowingly,--and as I\nsaid _perfect loveliness_, I think she knew where I found it. For she\nturned away, as if to look at the distance I was praising; and being in\nrapid chase of ever so trifling a thing to encourage me, after the many\nmistakes I had made, I tried with the greatest delight to believe that\nshe did that to rob me of a conscientious blush. But the wonder of all\nthese zig-zag ways, when a straight solid man tumbles into them, is that\nthey tussle him to and fro, a hundred times as much as they upset a\nslippery fellow whose practice is to slide in and out at pleasure. \"Oh,\nfor the wits of Tom Erricker now!\" was the only thought of things\noutside, that came to me in this crisis. Then again in a moment I\nscorned that wish. For a strong heart from its depth despises surface\ngloss and frothy scum.\n\n\"What is the proper expression for me? I see your noble father in the\ndistance. How shall I accost him?\" That I used such a word as\n_accost_--which I hate, but no better word would come to me--shows the\nstate of mind I had fallen into; not about him, but his daughter. For\nthe great S\u00c3\u00bbr--whatever they might mean--I did not care a fig as yet,\nand in fact felt rather annoyed with him. But it was of the utmost\nmoment now to make her prize my deference. That she did, far beyond the\nvalue, and smiled at me with a superior light.\n\n\"In his own land he is a prince,\" she said; \"not as those Russians call\neverybody; but a Prince of the longest generations. He, however, makes\nlightness of that; for he must have been the same without it. I have\nread that you are proud of your English race, which comes down to you\nnaturally. But my father is purer than to dwell upon that. He allows no\none to call him _Prince_. And I never call him anything but Father. We\nhave not many names in our country. He is Imar; and I am only Dariel.\"\n\nBefore I could go further into that important subject, I found myself\nlooking up at the most magnificent man I ever saw.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nS\u00c3\u009bR IMAR.\n\n\nAlthough it may seem very wonderful to those who have never been in that\nstate, nevertheless it is quite true, that in this condition of my\nfeelings, the magnitude of no man was a question that concerned me. Let\nhim be taller than the son of Kish, or wiser than Solomon the son of\nDavid, with supreme indifference I could scan the greatness of his body,\nor even of his mind. If Shakespeare had marched up to me, at that\nmoment, with \"Hamlet\" in his right hand, and the \"Tempest\" in his left,\nI should only have said to him--\"My good sir, are you the father of\nDariel?\"\n\nBut the beauty of goodness has some claim too, although more rarely\nrecognised, because so rarely visible. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's face invited love as\nwell as admiration, not only when his glance was resting on his gentle\ndaughter, but even when he had his eyes on me, who was longing all the\ntime to steal her. And I put on a manner whence he might conclude that\nit had never occurred to me to look at her.\n\nBut Dariel was above all thoughts of that, as much as I wished him to\nbe.\n\nShe rose on her purple sandals, which I had not observed till then, and\nkissed her dear father, as if she had not seen him for a month; but I\nsuppose it is their fashion, and he glanced at me as if he meant to\nsay--\"Nature first; manners afterwards.\" Then he looked again with some\nsurprise; and her face, which could tell all the world without a word,\nseemed to say to me--\"Now be on your very best behaviour.\"\n\nI was afraid she would use some foreign language, but her breeding was\ntoo fine for that.\n\n\"Father, at last we have the pleasure to see and know the kind\ngentleman who was so very brave, and who did us that great benefit. You\nbehold him; and his name is Mr. Cran-lee. Mr. Cran-lee, you behold S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar.\"\n\nBeing still in the skies to a certain extent, I longed for a hat of\ngreater dignity, to make a better bow withal; but still I stood up as an\nEnglishman should, in the presence of the biggest foreigner, until he\nknows more about him. I have thought sometimes that as every player at\nchess, golf, or billiards, knows almost at the first contact when he has\nmet his better, so we (without any sense of rivalry, and without being\never on the perk about ourselves) by some wave of Nature's hand along\nthe scale of her gifts to us, are aware, without a thought, when we come\ninto converse with a larger mind. Not of necessity a quicker one, not\nperadventure a keener one, possibly one that we could outdo, in the game\nof chuck-farthing, now the highest test we have.\n\nThis foreigner made me no bow at all, though I expected a very grand\none; he took me quietly by both hands, and said, \"I am very glad to know\nyou. Will you do me the favour of coming to my room?\"\n\nThe light of my eyes, and of his as well,--for that could be seen in\nhalf a glance,--vanished with a smile; and I followed my host through a\nnarrow stone-passage to an ancient door, studded with nails and iron\nfleurs-de-lis. That solid henchman was standing on guard, whom I had\nseen before, and known as Stepan; and inside lay that other mighty dog,\nof whom I had seen but little as yet, _Orla_, the son of _Kuban_. The\nroom was not large, but much loftier than the rooms of an old\ndwelling-house would be, and the walls were not papered nor painted, but\npartly covered with bright hangings, among which mirrored sconces were\nfixed, with candles burning in some of them. Stepan soon set the rest\nalight, so that the cheerful and pleasant aspect of the whole surprised\nme. But against the walls were ranged on shelves, betwixt the coloured\nhangings, metallic objects of a hundred shapes, tools, castings,\nappliances, implements unknown to me, and pieces of mechanism, enough to\npuzzle my brother Harold, or any other great inventor. But although\nthey were not in my line at all, I longed to know what they were meant\nfor.\n\n\"One of the great and peculiar features of the English nation,\" my host\nsaid, with a friendly smile, and slow but clear pronunciation,\n\"according to my experience is, that they never show much curiosity\nabout things that do not concern them. A Frenchman, a German, an Italian\nwould scarcely have cast his eyes round this room, without eager desire\narising in his bosom to know what the use of all these things may be.\nEven if he were too polite to enquire, he would contrive to fill me with\nsome conclusion of a duty to him--the duty of exposing to him my own\naffairs. With you it is entirely different. You do not even entertain a\nwish, you are free from all little desires to learn what could not in\nany way be your own business.\"\n\nAll this he put not as a question, but a statement of facts long proven.\nWhereas I was pricked internally with a very sharp curiosity. Could he\nbe chaffing me? I almost thought he must be, so far were his words from\ndescribing my condition. But on the other hand it would be too absurd,\nfor a foreigner to attempt to chaff an Englishman in his own language,\nand at the first conversation. So I tried to look as if I deserved the\nwhole of his compliments, and more. For I never like to think that a man\nis chaffing me; not even one of my own nation, and of proper rank to do\nit. Two bad turns of mind at once ensue, contempt of myself for being\nslow, and anger with him for discovering it.\n\n\"That is all a trifle,\" continued Prince Imar; for so I felt inclined to\ncall him now, to console myself for having such a cut beyond me--\"But I\ndid not bring you here for a trifle, Mr. Cranleigh. You Englishmen think\nvery little of yourselves. Not in comparison with foreigners, I mean;\nfor when it comes to that you have much self-respect. I mean with regard\nto your own bodies. You detest what you call a fuss about them, such as\nthe gallant Frenchman makes. But, as this has happened to you on our\nbehalf, you will not deny my right to learn what it is. I am not a man\nof medicine, but I have been present among many wounds. Will you do me\nthe favour of allowing me to see what has happened?\"\n\nIt would not be right for any one to say that I had fallen under this\nman's influence. No doubt I did that, when I came to know him better.\nBut as for any abject prostration of will, on the part of any healthy\nand sane man to another, at first sight, and through some occult power,\nsome \"odylic force,\" and so on--let the people believe in that, who can\ndo, or feel it. Nevertheless I showed him what had happened, because\nthat was common sense.\n\nAnd he took it strictly as a thing of common sense. \"You have done the\nvery best that could be done,\" he said, after looking at it carefully;\n\"it is a bad rent, even worse than I expected, and there will always be\na long scar there. But it will not lessen the power of the arm, if there\nis no other mischief. One thing is very important to know. Of the two\ndogs, which inflicted that wound?\"\n\nI told him that I could not pretend to say, having been in the thick of\nit between the two. And it had not occurred to me to think it out since\nthen. But remembering all I could of the ups and downs, I thought it\nmore likely that his dog had done it, having been so much more up in the\nair, while the bull-dog fought low, and was striving to grip upward.\nProbably _Kuban_ was making a rush at his foe, while I tried to get him\nby the neck.\n\n\"I hope with all my heart that it was so,\" my host replied very\ncheerfully; \"for then we need have no fear of any bad effects. There is\nno venom in the teeth of our noble mountain breed. But you will leave\nyourself to me.\"\n\nThis I did with the utmost confidence, and while he was using various\napplications carefully and with extraordinary skill, I ventured to ask\nin a careless tone--\"Of what mountain race is _Kuban_?\"\n\n\"Is it possible that you do not know? He is of the noblest race of dogs\nfrom the noblest mountains of the earth. A wolfhound of the Caucasus.\"\n\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's voice was very sad, as he dropped for a moment the herb he\nwas using, and fixed his calm dark eyes on mine. For the first time then\nI became aware that the general expression of his face was not that of a\nhappy man, but of one with a sorrow deeply stored, though not always at\ninterest in the soul. He was very unlikely, in his proud quiet way, to\nenlarge upon that; but of the common grief he spoke, with less heat and\nmuch greater resignation, than we feel about a railway overcharge.\n\n\"I am banished from the land where I was born. Of that I have no\ncomplaint to make. If I had been on the victorious side, perhaps I\nshould have done the like to those who fought against me. Perhaps I\nshould have been obliged to do so, whether it was just or otherwise.\nThat question cannot have any interest for you; and I owe you an apology\nfor speaking of it. But I am so grateful to the hospitable land which\nreceives me as if I belonged to it, and allows me to go anywhere without\na passport, that I wish every Englishman to understand that I shall\nnever make mean of their benefit. Will you do me the favour of tasting\nthis? You have borne much pain without a sign. It is Kahiti, the choice\nwine of the Caucasus, made within sight of Kazbek.\"\n\nWhere Kazbek was, or what Kazbek might be, I had not the least idea\nthen, though I came to know too well afterwards; but in fear of hurting\nhis feelings, and perhaps his opinion of myself, I looked as if I knew\nall about it. And as he began to pour out a pinkish liquid from an old\nblack bottle, with a fine smile sparkling in his quiet eyes, I could not\nhelp saying to myself--\"He deserves to be an Englishman.\" He was worthy\nalso of that crown of bliss, and came uncommonly near to it, when he\npraised his liquor, as a good host does, with geniality conquering\nmodesty.\n\n\"If you could only make this in England!\" he exclaimed, after drinking\nmy health most kindly; and I answered, \"Ah, if we only could!\" with a\nsmack of my lips, which meant--\"I hope we never should.\"\n\n\"Is this scratch likely to require further treatment? Or can I manage it\nmyself now?\" My question recalled him from some delightful vision,\nperhaps of grapes blushing on the slopes of some great mountain, perhaps\nof the sun making a sonnet of beauty, perhaps of his own honeymoon among\nthem, with the lovely mother of Dariel. It was rude of me to disturb\nhim; but why, if he wanted true politeness, why not send for a certain\nnymph to taste her native Helicon?\n\n\"_Orla_, come and show your teeth,\" he said; \"now, Mr. Cranleigh, his\nteeth are the very similarity of his father's. That is the one that\ninflicted the wound, the right canine; quite different would have been\nthat of the bull-dog. You need have no alarm. Shall I give you a--what\ncall you it--written testimony, to set your family at ease? What? Have\nyou never told them? Ah, but you take things with composure. It is\ntherefore all the more necessary for me to administer the proper\nmeasures. I shall require to see you in three days from this, and then\nat least once a week for the following two months.\"\n\nOh, what a chance, what a glorious chance of improving my acquaintance\nwith Dariel! Of course I could not expect to meet her every time, still\nnow and then--and as for that big Stepan, I warrant he knows what a\ncrown-piece is, as well as little Allai. With admirable self-denial, I\ncontended that such visits never could be needful, and that it was out\nof the question to spare so much time, etc., etc. But the great\nCaucasian stopped all that, by declaring that unless I trusted him\nentirely, and obeyed him implicitly, he should consider it his duty to\ninform my friends, that they might place me under strict medical\ntreatment. Thereupon, what could I do but consent to everything he\nrequired? Till with many directions as to my own conduct, he led me as\nfar as the door of _Little Guinib_, as he playfully called his snug\nretreat, and showed me before closing it behind me, how to obtain\nentrance at any time by pressing my hand against an upper panel, and he\ngave me leave to do so, as he said \"Good-night.\"\n\n\"No stranger would dare to enter thus, with _Kuban_ and _Orla_ loose\ninside, but you have made them both your faithful slaves. Good-night,\nand the Lord be with you.\"\n\nNow, though a Briton may be, and generally is, a very loose-seated\nChristian, only gripping on his steed when he is being taught to ride,\nor when he has to turn him into Pegasus, he is able to stand up in his\nstirrups high enough to look down upon every other pilgrim. When the\nPrince opened that bottle of wine, I said in my heart, \"Hurrah, this\ngreat father of Dariel cannot be a thoroughgoing Islamite;\" and now\nwhen he committed me to the Lord, instead of any Anti-British Allah, a\nstrong warmth of the true faith--which had been languishing, until I\nshould know what Dariel's was--set me quite firmly on my legs again.\nThus I went upon my way rejoicing, and the beautiful ideas that flowed\ninto my mind were such as come to no man, except when deep in love, and\nsuch as no man out of it deserves or cares to hear of.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIN THE BACKGROUND\n\n\nSurely as the world of night goes round, with clusters of stars\nthronging after one another, and loose wafts of vapour ever ready to\nflout them, and the spirit of dreams flitting over us, without any\nguidance of mind or matter, so surely will the dawn of our own little\ndays bring new things to us, which we cannot understand in the clearest\nlight of our wits beneath the sun. And of this I must give an instance\nnow, sorry as I am to do it.\n\nMy sister Grace (the very sweetest girl, always excepting one of course,\nthat ever tied a hat-string), what did she do but take a little touch of\nCupid, without knowing anything about it? She denied it strongly, and\nhotly even; as a Swiss hotel-keeper abjures scarlet fever. But I\ninsisted the more upon it; because it was quite picturesque to see Grace\nCranleigh in a passion. I found it worth while to go as near the brink\nof a downright lie as a truthful man can step, without falling over, in\norder to rouse and work up this dear girl, till she actually longed to\nstamp her feet. There was a vivid element--the father calls it gold, and\nthe brother calls it carrots--in her most abundant locks; and if you\ncould only hit upon a gentle strain of chaff, which must have a little\ngrain left in it, and pour it upon her with due gravity, she became a\ncharming sight to a philosopher.\n\nHer affection was so deep, and her character so placid, that a sharp\nword or two, or a knowing little sneer, produced nothing better than a\nlook of wonder, or sometimes a smile that abased us. She made no\npretence to any varied knowledge, or power to settle moot\nquestions,--though she would have known where Daghestan was,--and as for\ncontradiction, her tongue was never made for it, though her mind must\nhave whispered to her often enough that brother George's words outran\nhis wits. In spite of all this, it was possible to put her in a very\nnoble passion, when one had the time to spare. And it certainly was\nworth while for the beauty of the sight, as well as for increase of\nperception concerning the turns of the feminine mind. The first sign of\nsuccess for the most part was a deepening of the delicate and limpid\ntint that flitted on the soft curves of cheek; and then if one went on\nwith calm aggravation, that terrible portent, lightning in the blue sky\nof the eyes, and a seam (as of the finest needlework of an angel who\nhems her own handkerchief), just perceptible and no more, in the white\nsimplicity of forehead. And after that (if you had the heart to go on),\nno tears, none of that opening of the dikes, which the Low Country\nquenches an invasion with, but a genuine burst of righteous\nwrath--queenly figure, and all that sort of thing, such as Britannia\nalone can achieve, when unfeeling nations have poked fun at her too\nlong.\n\nFilled with a spirit of discontent, and a longing to know how girls\nbehave, when they are beginning to think about somebody,--for Dariel\nmust be a girl, as well as an Arch-female-Angel,--I contrived to fetch\nGrace to a prime state of wrath, the very first morning after her return\nfrom London. And I assure you that I learned a lot of things by that,\nwhich served me a good turn in my own case. A woman might call this a\nselfish proceeding. But what is love, except self flown skyward, and\nasking its way among the radiance of Heaven?\n\n\"This is a nice trick of yours,\" I said, with a careless air and an\nelderly smile, \"to go waltzing about in hot weather with young Earls, as\nif you thought nothing of your brother hard at work.\"\n\n\"I have not the least idea what you mean, brother George. I am thinking\nof you, George, wherever I may be. I never see anybody to compare with\nyou.\"\n\n\"Thousands of much better fellows everywhere.\" True enough that was,\nalthough I did not mean it. \"Brilliant young men in gorgeous apparel. I\nam not fit to hold a candle for them.\"\n\n\"Then hold it for yourself, George, as you have the right to do. And for\nall of us as well. For if ever there was an industrious, simple,\nunselfish fellow--\"\n\n\"I never like to hear about that, as you know. The little I can do is\naltogether useless. I only want to hear about the romantic young Earls.\"\n\n\"Young Earls!\" exclaimed Grace, with an innocence so pure that it\nrequired a little mantle on her cheeks; \"I fear that you have not been\nlooked after properly, while I have been away, dear George; or else you\nhave over-exerted yourself. Coming home also so late at night, several\ntimes, they tell me! Continuing your labours for our benefit, nobody\nseems to know exactly where! Such frightful work makes you quite red in\nthe face.\"\n\nIf that were true, all that I can say is, that the idea of being brought\nto book by a young girl like this, was enough to annoy the most superior\nbrother. But to let her see that was beneath me.\n\n\"I have thriven very tidily, while you have been away. My buttons never\ncome off, when I sew them on myself. But you know well enough what I\nmean about young Earls, and for you to prevaricate is quite a new thing.\nWhat I mean is about that young milksop of a fellow who writes verses,\nmakes sonnets, stuff he calls poems--fytte 1, and fytte 2, enough to\ngive you fifty fits. Lord Honey--something. What the deuce is his name?\"\n\n\"If you mean the Earl of Melladew, the only thing I regret, dear George,\nis that you have not a particle of his fine imagination. Not that you\nneed write poems, George; that of course would be wholly beyond you; but\nthat the gift of those higher faculties, those sensitive feelings, if\nthat is the right name, makes a man so much larger in his views, so very\nsuperior to coarse language, so capable of perceiving that the universe\ndoes not consist of men alone.\"\n\n\"Sensitive feelings! I should rather think so. He has got them, and no\nmistake, my dear girl. Why the year we licked Eton at Lord's, I happened\njust to graze him on the funny-bone with a mere lob, nothing of a whack\nat all for a decent fellow; and what did he do but throw down his bat,\nand roll about as if he was murdered? What could ever be the good of\nsuch a Molly-coddle?\"\n\n\"It comes to this then. Because you hurt him sadly when he was a boy,\nyou are inclined to look down upon him for life. Nice masculine logic!\nAnd you nearly broke his arm, I daresay.\"\n\n\"Scarcely took the bark off. But I'll break something else, if I catch\nhim piping love-ditties down here. I should have hoped that you would\nhave shown a little more self-respect.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't quite understand what my crime is, George. And to fly\ninto a passion with anybody who dares so much as to look at me! That is\nall Lord Melladew has done. And even that seemed too much for his\ncourage. I believe if he had to say boh to a goose, he would call for\npen and paper, and write it down. But your anxiety about me is quite a\nnew thing. Is there any favoured candidate of yours down here?\"\n\nHow sharp girls are! This was too bad of her, when I was doing my utmost\nfor her good. The twinkle in her eyes was enough to show that she\nsuspected something; and if she found it out, all up thenceforth with\nthe whole of my scheme for her benefit.\n\n\"Yes, to be sure there is,\" I answered in some haste, for if I had said\nno, it would have been untrue, for I thought more highly every day of\nJackson Stoneman, whereas Lord Melladew might be soon pulled down as we\nwere, and through the same ruinous policy; \"where will you find a nicer\nfellow, or one more highly esteemed (at any rate by himself), than my\nold friend, Tom Erricker? And when the tinning business comes to you,\nHarold will invent you a new process every day, until we are enabled to\nbuy back all our land. Though that would be a foolish thing to do,\nunless he could find some new crop to put upon it. I cannot see why you\nthink so little of Tom Erricker.\"\n\n\"Do you think much of him, George, in earnest? Is he a man to lead one's\nlife? Would you like to see your favourite sister the wife of a man she\ncould turn round her finger?\"\n\n\"Confound it! There is no such thing as pleasing you,\" I spoke with a\nsense of what was due to myself, having made the great mistake of\nreasoning. \"All of you girls begin to talk as if you were to rule the\nuniverse. No man is good enough for you, unless he is a perfect wonder\nof intellect. And then if you condescend to accept him, his mind is to\nbe in perfect servitude to yours--yours that are occupied nine minutes\nout of ten with considerations of the looking-glass.\"\n\n\"Can you say that of me, George? Now with your love of truth, can you\nfind it in your conscience to say such a thing of me?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps not. And for excellent reason. You have no need to make a\nstudy of it. Whatever you do, or whatever you wear, it makes no\ndifference; for you are always--\"\n\n\"What? What am I? Come, tell me the worst, while you are so put out with\nme. What are you going to call me now?\"\n\n\"The sweetest and the best girl in the world.\" I should not have put it\nquite so strongly, except for the way she was looking at me. But it was\ntoo late to qualify my words. Before I could think again, Grace was in\nmy arms, and her hair in a golden shower falling on my breast. \"After\nall, this is the best way to reason,\" she said with a smile that\ncontained a world of logic; and I only answered, \"At any rate for\nwomen;\" because it is not for them to have the last word always.\n\nHowever I had not changed my opinions, and did not mean to change them.\nFor Jackson Stoneman, whom I had at first repulsed and kept at a very\nstiff arm's length, was beginning to grow upon me,--as people say,--not\nthrough any affection for his money; so far from that indeed, that the\ntrue reason was, I could think of him now without thinking of his money.\nWhen we first know a man of great wealth, especially if we happen to be\nvery short of cash ourselves, we are apt to feel a certain shyness and\ndesire to keep away from him; not from any dislike of his money, or\nsense of injustice at his owning such a pile, but rather through\nuneasiness about ourselves, and want of perfect certainty in the bottom\nof our hearts, that we may not try--like a man who steals his gas--to\ntap the \"main chance\" behind the meter, and fetch a little into our own\nparlour on the sly. And even if our conscience is too brave to shrink\nfrom that, we know that if we walk too much in amity with this man of\ngold he will want, or at least he ought to want, to pay the piper who\nbesets every path of every kind in England; whereas it hurts our dignity\nto be paid for, except by our Uncles, or the Government.\n\nBut supposing Jackson were to become a member of our family, what could\nbe more inspiring and graceful, as well as delightful, for him, than the\nprivilege which must fall to his share, of endeavouring to please his\nrelatives? And looking at the matter from a point of view even more\nexalted, I began to perceive the course of duty very clearly staked out\nfor me. And the conversation above recorded made it doubly manifest. My\nsister had neither admitted, nor denied, that this young Melladew had\nbeen attracted by her, while she was staying at her sister's house. She\nhad spoken of his courage with some contempt; and any perception of such\na defect would be fatal to his chances with nine girls out of ten. But\nGrace had her own little pet ideas; and to shoot with swan-shot at a\nswarm of gnats is better worth the cost than to reason with such girls.\nThey are above reason; and there's an end of it.\n\nTo pass from all this to the things one can see, it was either that very\nsame day or the next, that I came away out of the harvest-field, just\nfor a morsel to eat and a pipe, in a snug place under the fringe of a\nwood, where a very small brook, fit only for minnows and grigs, made a\nlot of loops and tinkles. Two or three times I had been there before,\nand in fact was getting fond of it, because I believed, or as good as\nbelieved, without knowing every twist of it, that this little water in\nits own modest way never left off running until it reached the\nPebblebourne; and after that it must have gone a little faster, till it\ncame to the place where Dariel lived.\n\nPossibly if I threw in a pint bottle, after scraping off the red\npyramid, who could say that it might not land at the very feet to which\nall the world they ever trod upon must bow?\n\nEncouraging these profound reflections, I sat upon the bank, and pulled\nout my pocket-knife, being a little sharp-set for the moment, and aware\nof some thrills in a quarter near the heart. There was very little more\nto be done that afternoon, the week having ripened into Saturday, when\nno man of any self-respect does more than congratulate himself upon his\nindustry; and on this point few have a stronger sense of duty than the\ncultivator of the soil of Surrey. No matter what the weather is, or how\nimportant the job in hand may be, his employer may repose the purest\nconfidence in him, that he will make off with holy zeal, right early on\na Saturday.\n\nTherefore when I heard a step behind me, I knew that it could be none of\nour \"enlightened operatives;\" not even Bob Slemmick would pull his coat\noff at that hour, though he would sometimes stop long enough to put away\nhis tools. Correct was my reasoning, and with pleasure I beheld the\nactive figure and expressive countenance of Mr. Jackson Stoneman. Not\nthat every one would like this man, or care to have very much to do with\nhim. Universal benevolence was not by any means the polestar of his\nexistence, neither was it his chief employment to saunter amicably in\nthe Milky Way. Butter for his bread, and that the very best butter, had\nprobably been the main quest of his life; until his good stars brought\nhim down into our county, and toward our Grace. He was even beginning to\nrelax his mind, while he braced up his body already; and we thought that\na year or two of our fine air would bring a lot of hard gold out of him.\n\n\"Glad to see you again. Somebody told us that you were off for the\nMediterranean.\" In this careless manner did I shake hands with this 70\ncubit and 20 carat Colossus of gold. There is humbug in all of us--even\nin me.\n\n\"Well, I was thinking of it,\" he replied, as he sat down beside me, and\nstretched his long legs, trousered a thousand times better than mine,\nthough I knew which had most inside the cloth; \"but after all, what's\nthe good of foreign parts?\"\n\nKnowing but little about them as yet, and believing that he might\ntraverse many thousand leagues without finding anything to come up to\nSurrey, I answered very simply, \"You are quite right there.\"\n\n\"But isn't it disgusting, that in your native land, you can never make\nanything go to your liking?\"\n\nThis was very difficult for me to answer. I could not get along for a\nthousand wicked reasons--Free-trade, Democracy, adulteration,\nsewage-butter, foot-and-mouth complaint, living wage for men who have no\nlife, and all the other wrong end of the stick we get.\n\n\"What I mean has nothing to do with your ideas,\" he continued as if all\nmy ideas must be wrong, just when I was hoping that he began to see the\nright; \"for Constitutional questions, I don't care twopence. It has\nbecome a race of roguery between both sides. Don't look savage, George,\nyou know it as well as I do. Your party would do anything to get into\npower again. When the bone is in their own mouths, will they even try to\ncrack it? But I have not come to talk all that stuff. I am under your\ndirections in a matter nearer home. Are you going to play fast and loose\nwith me, while your sister is being truckled away to an idiot of an\nEarl?\"\n\nIf my mind had not been very equable and just, I must have had a quarrel\nwith him over this. And if he had looked at me with any defiance--but\nhis gaze was very sorrowful, as if all his hopes were blasted.\n\n\"Jackson,\" I answered in a rather solemn voice, having sense of my own\ntribulation, and I saw that he liked me to address him thus, though the\nname is not purely romantic, \"you are not a bit worse off than any other\nfellow. Do you suppose that nobody has ever been in love before? You\nlook at things from such a narrow point of view. Consider how much worse\nit must be for a woman.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish it was.\" His reply upset my arguments; I found it very\ndifficult to re-arrange them on that basis.\n\n\"So far as that goes, I can get on well enough,\" he proceeded as I\nlooked at him sensibly; \"I shall feel it for years, no doubt, but\nstill--but still the blackness and the bitterness of it is this, that\nsuch a girl, such a girl as never before trod the face of the earth, or\ninhaled the light of the sun--\" \"Don't get mixed,\" I implored, but he\nregarded me with scorn--\"should be sold, I say sold, like a lamb in the\nmarket, to an idiot, just because he has a title!\"\n\n\"You will be sorry when you have offended me,\" I spoke with\nextraordinary self-control, taking a side glance at my own case; \"for I\ndon't come round in a hurry, I can tell you. But you really don't know\nwhat you are talking of. My father and mother have heard of no proposal,\nneither have I. And as for Grace herself, she despises that milksop as\nheartily as I do.\"\n\n\"George Cranleigh, I have not known you long; but this I can say without\nhesitation, and I should like to see any man deny it, you are the very\nnoblest fellow that ever--\"\n\n\"Trod the face of the earth, or inhaled the light of the sun. And why?\nBecause I happen to agree with you. Ah, Jackson, allow me to improve the\nmoment. Is there any human praise that does not flow from the like\nsource, from the sense that the other fellow thinks as we do, and the\nsubtle flattery of our own wisdom, and concurrence with our wishes.\"\n\n\"Shut up,\" he cried with a smile, which must have procured him much\nlucrative business in the City; \"what has Farmer Jarge to do with\nmoralising? But are you quite sure of what you said--that she despises\nhim heartily?\"\n\n\"Unless anybody runs him down, she never has a good word to say for him.\nHe will be here upon some pretext or another; but you need have no fear.\nI see exactly how to treat the case--to praise him to the nines, and\nexalt him as the paragon of all manliness, and self-denial, and every\ntip-top element. And then to let her observe him closely, to see if he\ncomes up to that mark--and behold she finds him a selfish little funk!\nThat is the true policy with women, Jackson Stoneman.\"\n\nThe stock-broker looked at me, with puzzle in his eyes, which were ever\nso much keener than mine, and had a gift of creating a gable over them,\nlike a pair of dormer-windows with the frames painted black.\n\n\"Bless my soul, if you wouldn't do up our way!\" he said; and what higher\npraise could be given to a man? \"Friend George, you are a thousand times\nsharper than I thought. But all I wish is fair play, and no favour;\nexcept of course favour in a certain pair of eyes.\"\n\n\"You shall have it, my dear fellow, you shall have it. If only you will\nkeep yourself in the background, and do the most benevolent things you\ncan think of, without letting anybody know it. Your money is the main\npoint against you with her. Could you manage anyhow to be bankrupt?\"\n\n\"That comes to most of us in the end,\" he replied, with a sigh, which I\ndid not like at all, but hoped that it was rather of the heart than\npocket; \"if that were so, George, would you still take my part?\"\n\n\"Not unless my sister were really committed. But if she had set her\nheart upon you, Stoneman, your wealth or your poverty would make no\ndifference to me; and I am sure that it would make none to her.\"\n\n\"What more could a man wish? And I am sure you mean it. Come what will,\nI will play my game in an open and straightforward way. We must never\ntry any tricks with women, George. Bless them, they know us better than\nwe know ourselves. Perhaps because they pay so much more attention to\nthe subject.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nSMILES AND TEARS\n\n\nIf any one has followed my little adventures only half as carefully as I\nhave tried to tell them, he will see that the time had now come and\ngone, for my second visit to St. Winifred's, otherwise Little Guinib.\nAnd I would have set forth what happened then, if it had been worth\nmentioning. But except for the medical treatment received, I might just\nas well have stayed away, for I never got a glimpse of Dariel; and her\nfather was in such a sad state of mind, that he scarcely cared to speak\nat all. Being a most kind and courteous gentleman, he begged me to make\ndue allowance for him, for this was the anniversary of the most unhappy\nday of his life, and in truth it would have been better for him, if he\nhad died before he saw that day. One of the worst things of being a\ngentleman, or of having high-culture like Miss Ticknor, is that you must\nnot ask questions, or even hint at your desire to know more, but sit\nupon the edge of curiosity in silence, although it may be cutting you\nlike hoop-iron on the top-rail. And this feeling was not by any means\nallayed, when I saw the great henchman Stepan in the court hanging his\nhead, and without his red cross; and when with the tender of five\nshillings' worth of sympathy, I ventured to ask him to explain his woe,\nhis only answer was--\"Me no can.\"\n\nBut when another week had passed, and my next visit became due, the\nhills, and the valley, and everything else had put on a different\ncomplexion. It was not like a sunset when the year is growing old; but\nas lively and lovely as a morning of the May, when all the earth is\nclad in fresh apparel, and all the air is full of smiling glances at it.\nThere came to my perception such a bright wink from the west, and so\nmany touches, on the high ground and the low, of the encouragement of\nheaven to whatsoever thing looks up at it, that in my heart there must\nhave been a sense it had no words for--a forecast of its own perhaps\nthat it was going to be pleased, far beyond the pleasure of the eyes and\nmind. And in that prophecy it hit the mark, for who should meet me at a\nwinding of the path, but Dariel herself, no other? Dariel, my darling!\n\nAs yet she knew not--and I shivered with the thought that she might\nnever care to know--in what lowly but holy shrine she was for ever\nparamount. But a little blush, such as a white rose might feel at the\nmark H. C. in an exhibition, answered my admiring gaze; and then I was\nnowhere in the splendour of her eyes--nowhere, except for being\naltogether there.\n\nBut with no such disturbance was her mind astray. Alas, it was \"all\nthere,\" as sharp as the wits of the last man who wanted to sell me a\nhorse. And she did not want to sell me anything; only to keep her\nprecious value to herself. What a shame it is to leave things so that a\npoor fellow never knows how to begin! But that was not her meaning. In\nall her lovely life, she never meant anything that was not kind.\n\n\"I am not quite assured,\" she began, after waiting for me to speak,--as\nif I could, with the tongue in such a turbulence of eyes and heart!--\"it\nis beyond my knowledge of English society, Mr. Cran-lee, to be confident\nthat I am taking the correct step, in advancing in this manner to\ndeclare to you the things that have come into my thoughts. But if I have\ndone wrong, you will pardon me, I hope, because I am so anxious about\nvery dismal things.\"\n\n\"I assure you,\" I answered, with a flourish of my hat which I had been\npractising upon the road, \"that it is of the very best English society.\nIf we dared, we should insist upon it upon every occasion,\nMademoiselle.\"\n\n\"You must not call me that, sir. I am not of the French. I prefer the\nEnglish nation very greatly. There has only been one name given to me\nby my father, and that is _Dariel_.\"\n\n\"It is the sweetest name in all the world. Oh, Dariel, am I to call you\nDariel?\"\n\n\"If it is agreeable to you, Mr. Cran-lee, it will be also agreeable to\nme; for why should you not pronounce me the same as Stepan does, and\nAllai?\"--oh, that was a cruel fall for me. \"Although I have passed most\nof my life in England, and some of it even in London, I have not\ndeparted from the customs of my country, which are simple, very simple.\nSee here is _Kuban_ and _Orla_ too! Will you not make reply to them?\"\n\nHow could I make reply to dogs, with Dariel's eyes upon me? Many fellows\nwould have been glad to kick _Kuban_ and his son _Orla_, to teach them\nbetter than to jump around emotions so far above them. But not I, or at\nany rate not for more than half a moment; so sweetly was my spirit\nraised, that I never lifted either foot. Some of Dariel's gentle nature\ncame to strike the balance; for I may have been a little short of that.\n\n\"Good dogs, noble dogs, what a pattern to us!\" I had a very choice pair\nof trousers on, worthy of Tom Erricker,--if his had been ever\nbashful,--and in another minute there scarcely would have been enough of\nthem left to plough in.\n\nBut the joy of my heart--as I was beginning already to myself to call\nher--perceived at a glance the right thing to do; and her smile and\nblush played into one another, as the rising sun colours the veil he\nweaves.\n\n\"If Mr. Cran-lee will follow me, a step or two, I will show him a place\nwhere the dogs dare not to come.\"\n\n\"Follow thee! Follow thee! Wha wud na follow thee?\" came into my head,\nwith a worthier sequence, than ever was vouchsafed to Highlanders.\n\n\"Where the dogs dare not come\"--I kept saying to myself, instead of\nlooking to the right or left. The music of her voice seemed to linger in\nthose words, though they have not even a fine English sound, let alone\nItalian. But my mind was so far out of call that it went with them into\na goodly parable. \"All men are dogs in comparison, with her. Let none of\nthem come near, where ever it may be, except the one dog, that is blest\nbeyond all others.\"\n\n\"Are you a Christian?\" The question came so suddenly, that it sounded\nlike a mild rebuke--but no, it was not meant so. The maiden turned\ntowards me at a little wicket-gate, and her face expressed some doubt\nabout letting me come in.\n\n\"Yes, I am a Christian,\" I answered pretty firmly, and then began to\ntrim a little--\"not a very hot one I should say. Not at all bigoted, I\nmean; not one of those who think that every other person is a heathen.\"\n\nI had made a mull of it. For the first time I beheld a smile of some\ncontempt upon the gentle face. And I resolved to be of the strictest\nOrthodoxy evermore. Feeble religious views did not suit her.\n\n\"Christian! I should think so,\" I proceeded with high courage. \"There is\nscarcely a church-tower for ten miles round, that has not been built by\nmy ancestors.\" Possibly this assertion needed not only a grain but a\nblock of salt.\n\nBut Dariel was of good strong faith, without which a woman deserves only\nto be a man. She opened the gate, and let me in, so beautifully that I\nwas quite afraid.\n\n\"You must not be frightened,\" she said, with a very fine rally of\nherself, to encourage mine, \"it is the House of the Lord, and you have\ncome into it with your hat on. But you did not know, because there is no\nroof.\"\n\nNo roof, and no walls, and no anything left, except the sweet presence\nof this young maid. I took off my hat, and tried to think of the Creed,\nand the Catechism, and my many pious ancestors, if there had been any.\nAnd I almost tumbled over a great pile of ruin stones.\n\n\"We will not go in there, because--because we are not thinking of it\nproperly,\" she pointed, as she spoke, to an inner circle of ruins, with\nsome very fine blackberries just showing colour; and suddenly I knew it\nas the sanctuary, in which I had first descried her kneeling figure.\n\"But here we may sit down, without--without--it is a long word, Mr.\nCran-lee, I cannot quite recall it.\"\n\n\"Desecration,\" I suggested, and she looked at me with doubt, as if the\nword had made the thing. \"But you do not think it will be that, if I\nspeak of my dear father here?\"\n\nI was very near telling her that we think nothing of such old monkish\nruins, except to eat our chicken-pie, and drink our bottled beer in\ntheir most holy places; but why should I shock her feelings so? Little\nknows the ordinary English girl, that when she displays her want of\nreverence for the things above her, she is doing all she can to kill\nthat feeling towards herself, which is one of her choicest gifts.\n\n\"Dariel, you may be quite sure of this,\" I replied, after taking my seat\nupon a stone, over against the one she had chosen, but lower, so that I\ncould look up at her; \"a place of holy memories like this is the very\nspot especially fitted for--for consideration of your dear father. Some\nof my ancestors no doubt were the founders of this ancient chapel, so\nthat I speak with some authority, upon a point of that sort.\"\n\nAll content has a murmur in it, according to the laws of earth; and\nwithin a few yards of my joy, the brook with perpetual change of tone,\nand rise and fall of liquid tune, was making as sweet a melody as a man\ncan stop to hearken. But the brook might have ceased its noise for\nshame, at the music of my Dariel's voice. She gave me a timid glance at\nfirst, not for any care of me, but doubt of unlocking of her heart; and\nthen the power of a higher love swept away all sense of self.\n\n\"My father, as you must have learned already, is one of the greatest men\nthat have ever lived. There are many great men in this country also, in\ntheir way, which is very good; but they do not appear to cast away all\nregard for their own interests, in such a degree as my father does; and\nalthough they are very high Christians, they stop, or at least they\nappear to stop short of their doctrines, when the fear arises of not\nproviding for themselves. They call it a question of the public good,\nand they are afraid of losing commerce.\n\n\"But my father is not of that character. The thing that is recommended\nto him by religion is the thing he does, and trade is not superior to\nGod's will. Please to take notice of this, Mr. Cran-lee, because it\nmakes him difficult to be persuaded. And now he has told me quite lately\na thing, which if he adheres to it as he always does, will take him\naway, will extinguish, and altogether terminate him.\"\n\nShe turned her head aside, that I might not see the tears that were\nspringing upon either cheek, and a cloud of very filmy lace, from the\nstrange octagonal cap she wore, mingled with the dark shower of her\nhair.\n\n\"Oh, no, oh, no! that shall never be,\" I answered, as if I were master\nof the world; \"oh, Dariel, don't let your beautiful eyes--\"\n\n\"It is of my father and not of myself we are speaking, Mr. Cran-lee. And\nyou are surprised what reason I can have for--for inviting you to give\nopinion. But it is not your opinion for which I make petition, or not\nthe opinion only, but the assistance of kind action from you, if you can\nindeed be persuaded. And before that can be accomplished, I must expand\nto you things that you may not have been informed, concerning my father,\nyou know, do you not?\"\n\n\"Nothing, or very little except what you yourself have told me. I know\nall about Daghestan of course,\"--so I did by this time, or at least all\nthat was in the Cyclop\u00c3\u00a6dia,--\"and that your father has been a very great\nman there; and I can see that he has been accustomed to authority and\nprobably to wars, and that he is worshipped by his retainers, and that\nhe has some especial purpose here and prefers a private life, but is\nkind enough to give me admission because of my accident; and after that,\nlet me see, what else do I know? Why nothing at all, except that he has\nwonderful taste, and sense of order, and the loveliest\ndau--door-painting I ever beheld; and after that--\"\n\n\"Door-painting of great loveliness! I do not remember to have seen that;\nmy father has never concealed from me--I will ask him--\"\n\n\"Door-nailing is what I should have said, of course, Fleur de Lis\nflourishes, classic patterns. But what is all that in comparison with\nhim? A man of majestic appearance, and a smile--have you ever beheld\nsuch a smile?\"\n\n\"Never!\" cried Dariel, with great delight, \"but I expected not that you\nwould already be captured with that demonstrance. It shows how good he\nwas to be pleased with you, for he is not taken in with every one. But\nnow please to listen, while I tell you, so far as my acquaintance of\nyour language goes with me, what the condition is of circumstances\ntending about my father. Only I know not the half of it myself, for he\nfears to make me so solicitous; and it would not be just for me to ask\nquestions of people of the lower rank, in whom he has placed confidence;\nthough Stepan could tell me many things if he thought proper, and I have\nproved to him that it is his duty.\n\n\"My father is the Prince, as they call it in most countries, though he\nnever takes it to himself, of the highest and noblest and most ancient\nof the tribes belonging to the Lesghian race. The great warrior Shamyl,\nwho contended so long against all the armies of Russia, was of the\nlower, the Moslem division of the ancient Lesghian race, which is of the\nfirst origin of mankind, and has kept itself lofty as the mountains.\n\n\"But when all the other tribes fell away, with treachery and jealousy,\nand bribery, and cowardice, and Shamyl himself was betrayed in his\nstronghold, my father, who had been called to take the place of his\nfather who died in battle, at the head of the Christian and higher\ndivision of the race, could not prolong the war. Not that he was\nvanquished, that could never happen to him; but because all the\nMohammedans, who had made what they call a holy war of it, would not go\non under the command of a Christian, and they showed themselves so\ntreacherous that they betrayed him, for money no doubt, of which they\nwere too loving, into the hands of the Russian General. Every one\nexpected that he would be destroyed on account of the bitterness between\nthem, and the many times when he had been victorious. But the Russian\nCommander was much pleased with him, from the nobility of his manners,\nand treated him very gently, and finding that he was a Christian and\ndescended from English Crusaders, according to the red cross which we\nalways wear, as the badge of our lineage against the Moslem tribes, he\nobtained permission from Moscow to release him upon very generous\nconditions. His great extent of property was not taken from him, as was\ndone to most of the other chiefs, who had fought so long against Russia,\nbut was placed in the hands of a kinsman as his steward, and he was\nonly banished for fourteen years, until there should be no chance of\nany further war.\n\n\"My father made the best of all these things. He collected all the\nrelics of his patrimony, and travelled to many other lands, and then\nsettled in England, having learned while a boy in the 'City of\nlanguages,' where he was educated, to speak the English language as well\nas many others, German, French, Italian, Russian, Arabic, almost every\ntongue, for which he has a talent not granted to his daughter. But above\nall, he loves his own Lesghian words; and the rest of his life, if he\never goes home, will be spent for the education of the Lesghian people.\nHe will never conspire against Russia any more. He says that the tribes\nof the Caucasus are made up of every race under the sun, are always in\nconflict with one another, and speak, I forget how many languages, and\nhave, I forget how many forms of religion, whenever they have any\nreligion at all. But though he sees all these things, and is of the\nlargest mind ever vouchsafed to a man, he is filled in his heart with\nperpetual longing to be among the mountains of his early days, and to\nfinish all his wanderings in his first home. The fourteen years of his\nexile will expire very soon; and then what a joy there would be for him!\nI also long, more than it is possible to explain, to see the most noble\nland the Lord has ever made, though I only behold it in dreams\nsometimes, according to his description. For although I was born in the\nnoblest part under the shadow of Kazbek and in the most magnificent Pass\nof the earth, from which my name is taken, I was but a babe when my\nfather took me with him.\"\n\n\"If it must be so, if you must leave England,\" I asked with a very grim\nsmile, for what on earth would become of me without her, and I did not\neven belong to the Alpine Club, \"why should you be so unhappy about it?\nI fear there is no one in this country whom it would pain you much to\nleave. I fear that you find all English people rather dull, and cold,\nand uninteresting, and you will be too glad to be quit of them.\"\n\n\"I hear that they are cold, but I do not perceive it.\" Her glance as she\nsaid this was beyond interpretation; could it mean any cruel check to\nme? \"They are the first nation of all mankind, my father has declared\nto me, many times; but of such matters I have not yet arrived to think.\nThe thing that makes me full of fear about going from this safe land is,\nthat though the people may be dull and cold, as you do describe them,\namong them there is law and justice, and the wicked men are hanged\nwhenever they require it. But, alas, my father says that among his noble\npeople, no one can be sure of that.\"\n\n\"Dariel,\" I exclaimed with amazement, having made up my mind that her\nnature was all softness and all sweetness, \"surely you would never wish\nto be sure of anybody being hanged.\"\n\n\"I would never go to see it, as the people do in England, and I am not\nat all convinced that it ought to be done here. But in lands where the\nlaw of men's lives is revenge, even upon those of their own family, what\nelse is there to prevent them from committing murder? And that which\nterrifies me from all pleasure of seeing the land of my birth consists\nof that. Our family, the highest of the Lesghian race, have not that\nmost wicked rule of blood-revenge; but all the other tribes around them\nhave; and I am in the most dreadful alarm that my father has done\nsomething to make him subject to that barbarous, abominable,\nhorrible--oh, what shall I do? what shall I do?\"\n\nOnce more, I made offer to administer to her the kindest and softest\nconsolation; but she turned away sobbing, yet concealing it, as if it\ncould be no concern of mine. And this made me feel--I should be sorry to\nsay how.\n\nI believe that there is a bit of sulkiness in love, even with a man; and\nperhaps a large lump in a woman, because they are obliged to let it\ngrow. At any-rate I held my tongue. If her ladyship did not think me\nworthy of her confidence after all I felt, perhaps there was somebody\nelse who deserved it. I knocked my stick against my trousers; and it\nalmost seemed to me, as if I should like to whistle, if I mattered so\nlittle to the wind and sky.\n\n\"You are offended! You are angry with me!\" cried Dariel turning round,\nas if she were the larger part of me recoiling upon all the littleness.\n\"But I cannot tell you what I do not know. Everything is so dark to me.\"\n\nNow whether it was mean of me, or noble, depends upon the right view of\nthe case; but before she could repent of being kind, I got hold of her\nhand, and kissed it so as to assure her of my forgiveness. Then the\nloveliest colour ever seen on earth arose in her face, and in her eyes\nthere was the sweetest light just for a moment, and then she trembled,\nand I was afraid of myself.\n\nBy mutual accord we dropped that point. But I knew that she felt for the\nfirst time in her heart that the whole of mine belonged to it. Crafty\nlove and maiden fear combined to let that bide a while.\n\n\"I fear that it is too selfish of me, and too great trespass upon your\ngood-will,\" she said without looking at me again, \"if I ask you to help\nme in this matter. But you do admire my father, I think. Nobody can meet\nhim without that.\"\n\n\"He is the noblest and the grandest man I have ever had the honour of\nspeaking to. I wish that I could only do something for him. There can be\nno trespass on my good-will. Only tell me plainly.\"\n\n\"This is all I know, and I dare not ask more, for it is not considered\ngood to tell me. There is one day in the year of great sorrow and\nbitterness, through something that has happened in my father's life. It\nis something that he himself has done, though no one could believe that\nhe would ever commit a sin. Last year, and every year before that until\nnow, I was away and saw nothing of it, being under education with good\nladies of great learning. But now that is finished, and it was not\npossible for the tribulation to be concealed from me. Long before that I\nhad known there was something of very great misfortune and calamity to\nus; but I have never been permitted to hear more about it; and how can I\nlearn, of whom can I enquire? Stepan knows, I am almost sure of that;\nand perhaps Baboushka does--but as for telling me--it appears that with\nour people, the young maidens are kept out of reach of all knowledge;\nbut I have been brought up in England, and it is not curiosity, Mr.\nCran-lee, you must not be in such error as to think that I have\ncuriosity. It is anxiety, and love of my dear father, which any one of\nany age or nation has a right to; and if he is to go back into that\nland of danger without my knowing what I have to dread, or what to save\nhim from, how can I be of any use? He had better have no daughter.\"\n\n\"Shall I go and ask him all about it? He may think what he likes of me;\nif it will be of any good to you. No, that is not exactly what I mean.\nWhat I mean is, that I will take any row upon myself.\"\n\n\"I can scarcely understand what the English is of that.\" Oh, Dariel, can\neven you tell fibs? \"But if it is anything, Mr. Cran-lee, of a proposal\nunpleasant to you, and offering unkindness to my father, it is the very\nlast thing I would desire you to do. And what would become of you, when\nhe regarded you, as he has the power of doing to those--to those--who\nshow him what you call impertinence? What I was thinking of was quite\ndifferent to that. And though it would give some trouble, which I have\nno right to seek from you, there could not be anything unbecoming in it.\nI thought of it last night, when I was in such sorrow that I could not\nsleep with any happiness. My father has one great friend in London, a\ngentleman known to him in our native land, and who was a great part of\nhis coming to this country. He understands everything of our situation\nhere, and I have seen him several times. My father has told me to make\napplication to him, if anything should arise, beyond his own assistance.\nThe gentleman is not of our own rank of life, because he is of commerce,\nwhich we do not understand. Nevertheless he is very wealthy, and nothing\ncan be more respected than that point in England. He is now entitled\nSignor Nicolo, because it is better among the nations with whom he has\ndealings with the precious stones. But by birth, and of language, and\nthe ways of thinking, he has always been an Englishman of the name of\nNickols. And he is of an integrity beyond all common foreign names. He\nresides in the best part of London, mentioned by your great Shakespeare,\nand still called Hatton Garden.\"\n\n\"And you would like me to go and see him?\" I enquired with the greatest\nalacrity, perceiving a good chance now of discovering many things still\nmysterious; \"Dariel, it shall be done to-morrow. Don't talk of trouble,\nI beseech you.\"\n\n\"It is not only that,\" she answered, already assuming her right to my\nservices, which women are never very slow to do; \"but also the\ndifficulty that Signor Nicolo will have to perceive in what authority\nyou come. It is not as if you bore any message, or power of enquiry from\nmy father, for he would not wish at all that I should so employ myself.\nAnd if you do this for me, Mr. Cran-lee, you must bear in mind that my\ndear father will perhaps be much displeased that it has been done; and\nthen although he is so just and righteous, he will inflict the whole of\nthe blame upon you, because he can never find any fault with me. And\nthen perhaps you would never come here any more.\"\n\n\"Oh, that wouldn't do at all!\" I exclaimed, hoping that I saw a little\nsadness in her eyes; \"I shall put old Nickols under a frightful pledge,\npenalty of his very biggest diamond, never to let that cat out of the\nbag.\"\n\n\"He is not old Nickols. He is quite a young man, very clever, and very\nagreeable. And he has promised to do anything in the world for me.\nSignor Nicolo is a gentleman you would be much delighted to converse\nwith.\"\n\n\"Now you must know much better than that,\" thought I, \"the more\ndelightful he is, the more hateful to me.\" However, she did not seem to\ncatch that clue; but went on, as unconscious as the wire in the air is\nof its own significance.\n\n\"The last time he was here, I told him of my ancient ruby cross, the one\nwhich I wear most frequently, when I come to pray for my father here. It\nhas been preserved in our family from the period of the Crusades; when\nthe noble prisoners, escaping to our mountains, converted our tribe from\nidolatry, and married the fairest of the maidens. Signor Nicolo desires\nmuch to see it; and I will lend it to you, Mr. Cran-lee; and then he\nwill know that you have a right to ask concerning the questions of my\nfather. And the great question that you go to enquire of is this,\nwhether he can go back to the land belonging to him, without the\ngreatest peril to his own dear life.\"\n\n\"It is my determination,\" I replied, with some infection of her freely\nimported English, so sweet was the voice conveying it, \"not to leave\nthis matter now, until I have got to the bottom of it. Is there any\nother Prince, or Jeweller, or Crusader, whose ins and outs I ought to\nknow, before I can deal with him properly?\" My wrath grew as its tongue\nrolled on; and what tongue but our own can tell it then?\n\n\"There is another gentleman who has expressed a desire for a knowledge\nof our position here, and a little interview with me,\" she spoke as if\nshe lived without any dogs, or walls, or river, and I resolved at once\nto make _Kuban_ and _Orla_ as savage as _Grab_ himself was; \"but him I\nhave not as yet beheld at all. And he is a Prince, as you suppose so\nwell, possessed of great power already, even while he is so young,\nbecause of his courage and noble appearance, and desire to die for his\ncountry. He is a cousin of mine; and I have heard--but my father is most\nrighteous in whatever he proposes.\"\n\nShe dropped her beautiful eyes with a blush; and it was lucky that she\ndid not see me grind my teeth, for verily I must have looked--however, I\ncontrolled myself. \"What's the fellow's name?\" was the only thing I\nsaid.\n\n\"Prince Hafer, the Chief of the Ossets,\" she answered, looking with\ngreat surprise at me.\n\n\"Ossets! If I don't make bones of him,\" I muttered; \"but pardon me. Can\nI have the cross at once? I cannot go to see your dear father to-night.\nImportant business--I had quite forgotten. But yours shall be the first\nattended to. Oh, Dariel, Dariel, I must be off, before I say anything to\nvex you. Send Allai to-morrow night, and you shall hear of that young\nNickols.\"\n\nProbably she thought I was mad, and she was not far wrong, if she did\nso. She gave me the cross, to get rid of me perhaps; and I snatched her\nhand and kissed it, and was out of sight in no time.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHE RUBY CROSS\n\n\nIn all matters of love there is a vast amount of luck. That there is of\ncourse in all human affairs, as far as we can interpret them; but what I\nmean is a larger element of luck than in any of our other miseries;\nunless it be the still finer conflict, and far more enduring one, for\nmoney. Any one might have concluded, as I did, that it was all up now\nwith every little hope I might have nursed of winning the favour of\nDariel. Yielding to a sudden rush of jealousy, I had quitted her hastily\nand almost rudely, and broken my appointment with her father. It was\ntrue that her calmness and perfect indifference were enough to provoke a\nsaint--if he ever falls in love; but how could she know that? Though\ncertainly she ought to know it, if she ever thought of me in at all the\nproper vein. \"What a fool I am! It will serve me quite right, if she\nnever even condescends to glance at me again,\" I thought, as I wandered\nabout in the dark, after going home at a great pace upon the wings of\nrage; \"and just as I was getting on so nicely too! What is the use of my\ngoing to see that Nickols? A rogue no doubt, almost sure to be a rogue,\nfor sticking a foreign tail on to his name. No doubt he cheats them of\ntheir diamonds and rubies. That is why he wants to see this cross. Worth\na lot of money, I dare say. What an idiot I must be, to even think of\nthat, when I remember where it has been so often! Oh, Dariel, Dariel!\nWhen I first saw your beautiful, enchanting, ravishing,\nidolatrous--idolised I mean, confound it all--who could have imagined\nthat I should ever hold this badge of your faith--this symbol of your\nown high-minded, lofty-souled archetype--pish, there is no word to come\nnear her! But, oh, shall I never come near her again?\"\n\nTo cut short all discussion, I found myself in a frightful state both of\nhead and of heart, and ready to do anything to bring matters to the\ncrisis. Accordingly I said to Slemmick, who was in his right mind now,\n\"Just look after things to-day; I'm obliged to go to London.\" He\ngrinned, and I knew that he would be a tiger to any man lying down under\na rick.\n\nAs yet my conceptions about jewellers, diamond-merchants, and the like\nwere little more than a confusion of the Arabian Nights and Bond Street;\nso that it seemed to be quite a mistake when the policeman in a little\ndingy street pointed out a very common-looking house as the abode of\nSignor Nicolo. There was nothing to show that it contained as much as a\npaste shoe-buckle or a coral pin, and it struck me that if diamonds were\ntested there the light must proceed from the jewel itself. But perhaps\nit would be lighted up by Koh-i-noors, Stars of the South, and other\nglorious luminaries.\n\nNot only the house but the inhabitants thereof appeared to be sadly in\nneed of lighting up. How many times I rang, or at any rate pulled the\nlong handle, I will not pretend to say; but at last an old woman, not at\nall too clean, showed me into a small square room, remarkable for\nnothing except that one end appeared to consist of polished steel. My\ncard was taken upstairs, and presently Signor Nicolo himself appeared.\n\n\"Upon important business!\" he said. \"Ah, yes! Mr. George Cranleigh. Ah,\nyes, ah, yes!\" He was rather a handsome little man, about forty years\nold, with dark eyes and complexion, wearing a black velvet blouse,\ngathered in with a belt, and a red scarf under it. Apparently an\nEnglishman who desired to pass as a foreigner, and having a considerable\nshare of Jewish blood might do so without much trouble. Whether his\nperpetual \"Ah, yes\"--which I shall not repeat half as much as he\ndid--had first been assumed in imitation of some foreigner or had struck\nroot into his tongue, as \"You know,\" \"Don't you see?\" and other little\nexpletives are wont, it is beyond my power to say.\n\n\"And this you have brought me. Ah, yes, ah, yes,\" he proceeded when I\nhad explained my purpose, \"to certify that the Prince desires me to\nimpart to you all my knowledge concerning him. The rubies are very fine,\nand the trinket very ancient. They would not be set in silver\nnow-a-days. But I do not perceive in them, Mr. Cranleigh, you will\nexcuse my saying so, any message from the Prince to that effect.\"\n\n\"You mistake me, Signor,\" I answered with some warmth, for the man's\naffectation annoyed me, and I longed to call him \"Jemmy Nickols,\" as his\nGod-fathers and God-mothers meant him to be called; \"I said nothing\nabout S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, who makes no pretence to be called a Prince,\"--that was\na little rap at Jemmy,--\"it is his daughter who has sent me to you,\nbecause she is most anxious and miserable about her father. What she\nwants to know is this--can he return to his native land, from which he\nhas been so long banished, without incurring very great danger? You can\ntell me or not, just as you please. The question lies between you and\nher. She has always believed you to be her true friend. She cannot come\nto see you herself, of course, and her father might be angry if she\ntried to do so; and he would know your hand if you wrote to her. It\nappears to me that she has a right to ask.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes. She has a right to ask; and more than that, it is her place to\nask, that she may know how to act about it. On the other hand, the point\nfor me is--have I any right to tell?\"\n\nI began to respect the man more, as I perceived that he really wished to\ndo what was right, but scarcely saw the way to it, through some little\ncomplication. \"Signor, I am not in any hurry,\" I observed.\n\n\"Ah, you cannot understand,\" he said, as if I had no power, even if I\nhad a right, to put my tongue in; \"it is no reproach to you; but a young\nman who has never been among such things ought to thank his good stars,\nand keep out of them. You English are so stiff, you can allow for no\nideas. You think that all the world must have the same right and wrong\nas you have.\"\n\n\"Now, Signor Nicolo,\" I replied, with admirable self-control, for I\nbegan to know all about him now, by the lights that break in as we go\non in the dark, \"if ever there was an Englishman, you are one.\" He\nlooked at me steadily with eyes almost too dark for a pure-bred\nEnglishman, and then seeing that I meant to make him proud he became\nproud, as he ought to be.\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" he said first, from the force of habit, and then he went on,\nas became his birth-right. \"Sir, I am an Englishman, and as proud of it\nas you are. But we are not popular among the smaller nations, because\nthey have a lower standard. We give them everything in the way of trade,\nand they have not the calibre yet to enter into it. And I am very much\nafraid that they won't have that, till they have taken every farthing\nout of us. In spite of all lessons, we carry on still, as if all the\nworld were full of our own ideas. And what comes of that? They believe\nthrough thick and thin that our only ambition is to rob them. My\nbusiness lies chiefly on the Continent, and therefore I am Signor\nNicolo.\"\n\nFeeling the truth of this sad state of things, I took the hand he\noffered me. It was not his fault, but that of our blind rulers, that to\ndo any business he must be of foreign blood. Still it was a new light\nshed upon me, for hitherto my belief had been that people unlucky enough\nto have to live upon the land, had to bear the brunt of that British\nsuicide endowed with the catch-penny name Free-trade.\n\n\"Now, I am in this difficulty,\" continued the Signor, still employing\nthe gesticulation he had learned; \"on no account would I offend Prince\nImar,--a Prince he is, whether he likes it not,--while on the other\nhand, I may be guilty of his death, if I stand upon scruples. And that\nwould be a very poor requital, for I owe him my life, and am proud to\nowe it to a man so great and magnanimous. Crotchety perhaps, as all\ngreat men are, and sometimes even more than that; but take him all\nround, such a man as you won't see in a long day's ride, Mr. Cranleigh.\"\n\n\"That is the opinion I have formed of him. A man of the first magnitude\nin body, mind, and character. As yet I know very little of him; but one\nis struck with such a rarity at once, just as----\"\n\n\"As I might be with an enormous diamond. But I am surprised to hear you\nsay that you know him so little. I suppose he keeps himself very much\nto himself, down there. It was I who arranged that place for him.\"\n\n\"I do not even know whether he has any visitors. None from our part of\nthe country I believe. But I saw no signs of secrecy about the place. It\nis naturally very lonely and secluded, and out of the line of the more\nimportant roads. And he has as good as told me that he was busy about\nsomething that he did not wish to talk about. It is suspected in some\nquarters that his business is the forgery of Russian rouble-notes.\"\n\n\"No, you don't say that! What a people we are! Ah, yes, ah, yes! I have\nbeen on the Continent for some weeks, or certainly I must have heard\nthat grand joke. And they will make a raid upon him soon with a\nsearch-warrant I dare say. Oh, I would give something to see that! Tell\nthem to keep the dogs in. I know what they are. And the policemen would\nshoot them as soon as look, for doing the very duty they have to do\nthemselves, only doing it with a little more sagacity. Don't forget\nthat, Mr. Cranleigh. I wouldn't have those dogs killed for a thousand\npounds. There is not a dog to compare with them in England. I knew their\ngrandfathers in the Caucasus.\"\n\nHereupon I told him, just to help my case, how lucky I had been by a\nvery simple stratagem in saving the life of that glorious _Kuban_ from a\nlow beast of a bull-dog, and he laughed, and said \"Capital! I should\nnever have thought of that. By the by, I know something of your brother,\nMr. Cranleigh. He has very nearly made a diamond, and he came to me\nabout it. Upon my word, I thought at first that he had succeeded, until\nI threw my test-light on it. It was the nearest approach that has been\naccomplished yet. I dare say he told you all about it.\"\n\n\"Not a syllable. He never does, unless it is to try the effect upon me.\nHe has the lowest possible opinion of my intellect. He has monopolised\nthe brains of the family. But he is glad enough to come to me for more\nsubstantial things.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes! I see. But he will astonish the world some day. What amazed me\nabout him was not his inventive power--though that must be very great,\nof course--so much as the quantity of pluck he showed, at any rate I\nshould call it so. You would have thought it the turning-point in a\nyoung man's life, to know whether he had solved the great problem, or\nfailed; but his hand never shook, it was as steady as mine now, and his\ncolour never changed, he was as cool as any cucumber--the last one I\nbought was as hot as ginger. And when I said, 'No, sir. Not quite yet,'\nhe made me the most beautiful bow I ever saw, and walked off, leaving\nthe work of months with me.\"\n\n\"That is Harold all over. But he will never do any good. He is always on\nthe brink of success, but never in it. And if he ever does succeed, all\nhe'll say will be just this--'Oh, any fool can do that,' and never think\nof it again. However, I must not go on about him. Time is getting on,\nand I ought to be at home again. What answer shall I take to Miss--Miss\nPrince Imar?\"\n\n\"Do you know what Dariel is?\" Nicolo was smiling in a genial manner at\nmy levity. And then he said, to crush it in a truly British manner,\n\"Dariel is the heiress to the throne of Georgia. She has the pink eagle\non her left shoulder.\"\n\n\"But there is no throne of Georgia now,\" I answered, quite uncrushed,\nfor she might have been heiress to the throne of all the stars, without\nmounting any higher than she already was with me; \"the Russians have got\nGeorgia, and who shall ever turn them out?\"\n\nThis will show how I had got up my subject. A month ago Georgia, for all\nI knew or cared, might have been the property of our former George the\nFourth, or still the prize of victory for Saint-George and the Dragon.\n\n\"You take things as quietly as your brother Harold does. Ah, yes! it\nmust be in the family, no doubt. But I give you my word that it is true,\nMr. Cranleigh. Not that her father is a Georgian though, he belongs to a\nhigher race, the Lesghians, and the highest tribe of the Lesghians. All\nthe others, such as Shamyl, are Mohammedans. Dariel's mother was the\nPrincess Oria, the last representative of Tamara, the celebrated Queen\nof Georgia; and she was carried off from Tiflis--it is a most romantic\nstory; I can't tell you a quarter of it. But there was some frightful\ntragedy--bless you, they are always having tragedies there--and the long\nand the short of it is, that Imar has incurred the blood-feud. You may\nbe sure that he never ran away from it. He has the greatest contempt and\nloathing for all such horrible heathenism. After the capture of Shamyl\nall hope of resistance was over, for the Mohammedan tribes fell away, at\nonce. Shamyl's chief hold over those fierce races had been his position\nas Imaum, which confers divine command over those who belong to Islam.\nAh, he was a gallant Chieftain, but cruel sometimes, ah, yes, ah, yes!\"\n\n\"And your share in these adventures, Signor? You must have carried your\nlife in your hands. It seems as if there can be no danger in the world,\nwithout some brave Englishman being in the thick of it.\"\n\nJemmy Nickols threw his blouse open and showed a fine broad chest, which\nhe patted. \"You are right there,\" he said, \"it generally happens so. Ah,\nI was an active fellow in those days, and afraid of nobody but the\nDevil. And you may be sure, there was plenty of Him there. Ah, yes, our\nnation is always on about its sailors; but to my mind the landsmen are\nevery bit as good. However, it was business that took me there, and not\nany pleasure in hardship.\n\n\"I had to make my own way in the world, and was tired of sitting on a\nstool in London. So I got a commission from the firm to Amsterdam, my\nfather being one of the partners, and there I heard of something which\nsent me across Europe to meet a Russian merchant at Odessa. I found him\nquite a young man and very enterprising, which was not very often the\ncase with them in those days. We became good friends, and he told me\nthat he had heard from a brother of his, a Russian officer then serving\nagainst Shamyl, of a wonderful discovery of emeralds they had made among\nthe mountains of Daghestan. My knowledge of jewels was greater than his,\nand he made me an offer which I could not resist, to pay all expenses,\nand give me all benefit of Russian protection, if I would join him in\nthe search for this treasure; and if we found it, 25 per cent of all net\nproceeds.\n\n\"This was a wild-goose chase, you will say, but what young man of spirit\nis not a wild goose? We had a rough time of it and repented every day of\nour folly, but still went on with it. The Russians had an enormous\narmy, spread far and wide, and whenever we could keep near them we got\non well enough, but where we had to trust ourselves to native guides,\nwith the help of some interpreter, it was scarcely ever safe to close\nour eyes. Let me see, it must have been in 1858, towards the close of\nShamyl's long defence. It has often been said that the allies should\nhave landed a large force in Western Caucasus, to help him during our\nRussian war. But it would not have done a bit of good. He was far away\nin the Eastern chain, and it would have been a stiffish march to get\nnear him, I can tell you, and when we were there, we could have done no\ngood. People talk of Caucasia as if it were a nation. I cannot tell you\nhow many tribes there are; but for the most part they hate one another,\nand they speak about seventy languages, and cannot write any one of\ntheir own. How could you ever make a Nation of them? Russia might have\nconquered them a century ago, if she had been in earnest about it; and\nit is the best thing that could possibly happen to them now. Some little\nlaw and honesty, without any real oppression, is ever so much better\nthan a lot of murderous freedom. And pretty freedom! Why, in many of the\ntribes, the women have to do all the work, while the men lounge about,\nor rob their neighbours. My opinion is, Mr. Cranleigh, that we talk a\nlot of rot about civilization. Nature won't have it everywhere; and she\nshows what she means, by the way she marks the places. And the worse\nthey are in all common sense, the closer the natives stick to them.\n\n\"Well, we got a taste of the country, and the people that therein do\ndwell. My poor friend did not live to tell of it, neither should I, but\nfor Prince Imar. It was in a rocky hole where you said to yourself,\n'Never shall I get out of this, and it must have been the Devil that got\nme into it,'--when suddenly a score or two of thundering savages jumped\nout from the solid crag almost, and blocked all the horrible place both\nways. I am not at all sure that they meant to hurt us; and I dare say\nthey would have been satisfied to strip us, and rob us of our arms and\nmoney, and send our guides to the right about. But unluckily my Russian\nfriend lost his head, and sent a bullet into the crowd in front. I\ncannot tell you, any more than he could now, what happened in the rush\nthat was made on us. Only that my dear friend lay dead upon his back,\nwith his eyes upon the little blink of sky above the chasm, and that I\nlike a fool fell upon him to protect him, when nobody could harm him any\nmore, and a big fellow was going to give me my quietus when another man\ntwice his size sent him spinning. All the others fell away, for he had\ncome among them suddenly, and I heard them muttering 'S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar.'\n\n\"'No Englishman shall come to harm, when I can help it. This gentleman\nlooks like an Englishman,' he said, and I never was more ready in my\nlife to acknowledge that. The rest of the lot could not make out what he\nmeant, but they put down their weapons and looked at him. To cut a long\nstory short, he took me to his own mountain-castle, and treated me as if\nI had been an invited guest, and I never knew such hospitality in all my\nlife. I stayed there a long time, for it was not safe to travel; and\nthere I saw the most beautiful lady that ever trod this earth. Her\ndaughter is very beautiful; but you should have seen the Princess Oria,\nif you want to know the utmost that the Lord can do in the construction\nof the human race.\"\n\n\"Don't talk to me,\" I said, for I could not quite stand this; \"you are\nlike the rest who always talk of the past as superior to the present.\nBut I beg your pardon, pray go on.\"\n\n\"I have seen a great deal of the world. Ah, yes!\" continued my new\nfriend Nicolo; \"and I have come to this conclusion, from all the\ninstances within my knowledge--no very beautiful woman ever lives a life\nof happiness. I don't mean pretty girls of course, and all the fair\nwomen of ordinary charms. I mean the exceptional, the wonderful\ncreatures, of perfect and enthralling loveliness, of whom there are not\nsix in a century. They are as rare as a brilliant of three hundred\ncarats; as yet I have only seen one, and that one was the Princess\nOria.\"\n\n\"Then how can you argue about them all?\" I enquired very reasonably.\n\"You mean from history, and all that, I suppose. But what became of that\nwonder of the world?\"\n\nI should have known better than so to speak, when he was inclined to be\npathetic. But absurd as it may seem, I was jealous of Dariel's own\nmother, when quoted against her.\n\n\"Alas, that is more than I can tell,\" he replied without heeding my\nflippancy. \"I only know that it was pitiful, pitiful, something to make\nall who heard of it shudder. Prince Imar was a most cheerful man, full\nof life and spirit, even in the thick of blows and danger, when I had\nthe honour of being his guest. Not a sign of jealousy about him,\nintroducing all friends to his lovely wife,--which is not the custom\nwith the Moslem tribes, of course,--pleased that a comrade should share\nher sweet smile, and proud that she should be admired. And as for her, I\nbelieve she adored him. Insignificant as I was, I believe that she\npreferred me to many grander people, simply because I was never tired of\nsinging his praises, and because I owed my life to him. They cannot have\nquarrelled, at least I should have thought so; neither can she have\nbetrayed him. One never can be certain, where a woman is concerned;\notherwise I should have thought it utterly impossible. And yet what else\nis there that can at all account for it? She perished most sadly, there\nis no doubt of that. And I dare not even mention the subject before him.\nEven Dariel knows not a word about it.\"\n\nI could well understand that a man's most intimate friend would shrink\nfrom such a subject, and Nickols was not at all likely to be very\nintimate with S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, though he might have proved a valuable agent.\n\n\"Was there any Dariel in those days?\" I enquired, though I might have\nconcluded from her age that there was not.\n\n\"No, there was not any Dariel yet. But there was a fine little chap,\nabout a year old, and how well he could run! I have had him on my lap,\nmany a time. What was his name? Oh, Origen. Those people save their\nfriends a world of trouble by being contented with one name. But now I\nhave told you all I know, Mr. Cranleigh, or all that can be of\nimportance. And of course you will not speak about it to any one. Every\none has a right to his own privacy, and our friend insists upon a\nprivate life. He might have been the lion of a season if he had liked,\nwith his romantic history and noble appearance. Ah, yes, ah, yes! but I\nfear I must hurry you, or ask you to call again. We hold a meeting at 3\no'clock, of a Syndicate they call it--horrible word--about a big find in\nSouth Africa. In return for my information, I beg you to let me know if\nanything is threatened down there; and to do your utmost, if you have\nany influence, to keep them from returning to the Caucasus. He has\nplenty of money. Why can't he stop here, and have the sweet Dariel\nintroduced at Court? There is a very great man indeed who would be only\ntoo proud to manage it.\"\n\n\"Plague them all!\" I cried, as he began to fidget, \"how many more great\nmen, I wonder? But did you ever get those emeralds?\" The \"plenty of\nmoney\" made me think of this.\n\n\"Never saw one of them. Never got so far. And what could I do, when my\nfriend was killed? Very likely they are there though. I shall look them\nup some day, perhaps, if I can hear of that Russian officer. But most\nlikely not worth finding. Pale emeralds fetch very little. Good-bye,\ngood-bye! Don't forget one thing. Have the dogs chained up, for fear of\nthe police making holes in them.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are not afraid of the dogs making holes in the police?\" I said,\nwhile shaking hands with him. \"I should be sorry to have to fight\n_Kuban_ and _Orla_, with a police-staff.\"\n\n\"So should I. But you may depend upon it, when they make a raid of that\nsort, expecting a big capture, and stout resistance, they will not come\ndown without fire-arms.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nSISTER _v._ SWEETHEART\n\n\nThere had not been, so far as I could recollect, anything that could be\ncalled even a tiff--if such a wretched syllable can find its way into\nthe heaven seventy-seventh--between the lovely Dariel and myself; but on\nthe other hand I had left her rather more abruptly than courtesy would\nwarrant, because of the grievous tranquillity she displayed in speaking\nof a fellow (a Prince Hafer, as she called him), who possessed almost\nevery hateful merit, and was eager to bring it in, to cut out mine, by\nsome underhand and undermining fraud. What had I done to be treated like\nthis? Was there no claim established on my part? Was it nothing to have\ncome down the hill that evening, at the risk of my neck and Old Joe's as\nwell, and then to put up with a strained conscience for a month, and\nthen to catch no fish every day, for it might be a week of hook and\nbarb, and then to run a frightful risk of hydrophobia, and then to let\nmy duty and the business of the farm--however, there was not much to be\nsaid about that; but what had I done that no message came, that I should\nbe left to cool my heels, without even a distant sigh in token of some\nlittle anxiety about me?\n\n\"Send Allai to me to-morrow night,\" I had said as plainly as possible,\n\"and you shall hear all about young Nickols.\" It was no young\nNickols--that was my mistake, or my jealousy had rejuvenised him; but\nthat could not alter the intention.\n\nWas it to be supposed that Dariel, the gentle, and sensible, and\nsimple-hearted Dariel had taken offence at my hasty departure, and\nresolved to have no more to say to me?\n\nI passed a very anxious and uncomfortable time, endeavouring vainly to\nturn my whole attention to the doings and the interests of other people,\nwho certainly had a strong claim upon me; but still a certain feeling\nwould arise in my kindest and largest moments, that it was scarcely just\non my part to neglect with such severity my entire duty to myself. Who\nwas farmer Bandilow, who was Lord Melladew, Jackson Stoneman, or even\nsister Grace, that I should have no one to think about but them? Let the\nwhole parish, and the county too, rush into the Union, and break stones,\nor be stone-broken, by means of this new crack; but love is immortal,\nLove is Lord of all; what had I done to make him hold his blessed tongue\nlike this?\n\nI strode about, and strove about, and let everybody know that when I was\nput upon I could stand up against it; and my dear sister Grace, who had\nideas of her own, such as I had spoiled her into when she was my\nchildhood's pet, was beginning to smell--oh, vile metaphor!--a rat;\nbecause I would not always do exactly what she wanted, and once I had\nthe courage to tell her, that there were other girls in the world\nbesides Grace Cranleigh. Her state of mind at this was enough to prove\nto mine, that the great truth thus pronounced was a good one for the\nworld; and I venture, with some tenderness, to intimate as much. But how\nmuch better for me, as for every man so placed, if, instead of using\ntongue, I had plunged both hands into my pockets--a proceeding which\npuzzles and checkmates the female race, because they cannot gracefully\ndo the like--and then had walked off with a whistle, which adds _pari\nratione_ to their outer insight.\n\n\"Then I am right,\" said Grace, catching her advantage, as a girl always\ndoes, before it is even on the hop; \"there is some sly girl, without the\nsense of right to come and ask me what I think of it, who has laid her\nsnares too cleverly for my dear brother George, my only brother, I might\nsay. For Harold is too far above us in intellect to be counted as one of\nthe family. Oh, it is so sad, so sad and cruel to me!\"\n\n\"Explain yourself,\" I answered, hitting by a fluke on the very best\nthing to be said to a girl, because she never knows how to do it. And\nwhat had Harold done, to be set in the sky, like that?\n\n\"You know what I mean well enough. Too well, George, I can see it in\nyour face. Now can you look at me in your solid old way, as I have every\nright to demand, for even you will own that, and assure me on your\nhonour that I am altogether wrong? That there is nobody wanting to come\nbetween us. That I am still number one--'A1' you used to call me; but\nthat sounds like slang; and I don't understand the sea. Am I number one\nstill, George?\"\n\n\"Let every tub stand upon its own bottom.\" I was not taken altogether by\nsurprise, as she intended; for I had expected this for a long time,\nknowing how sharp our Grace was. I could scarcely have said a more\nappropriate thing; for my sister had her stiff linen apron on, bustling\nabout with it, as she did in the mornings, to attend to the dairy and\nthe poultry, and all that. And being of a noble English figure, she had\nnot pulled her waist in, as she found it her duty to do at one o'clock.\n\n\"I am not a tub, George. It is very unkind of you to use such\nexpressions about me. I don't care what you say in fun, you know. But\nwhen it comes to serious talk--but I dare say _she_--oh, you could span\nher with one hand.\"\n\n\"My dear sister,\" I replied, because I saw some sign of glistening in\nher bright blue eyes, and knew that it was all up with me, if that\nshould come to drops; \"I have never told you a falsehood, and I am not\nlikely to begin. Harold may have all the intellect of the age; but can\nyou say as much as that of him?\"\n\nShe shook her head, and made a face, which enabled me to smile at the\nsuperiority of his mind. \"Well, then, I will tell you--there is a little\ntruth in some of your imaginations. Though not at all as you think.\nQuite the opposite extreme. A great deal too good for me, too perfect,\ntoo lofty, too beautiful, in every way too angelic.\"\n\n\"It is quite unnecessary to tell me that.\" Grace might have shown more\nrefined feeling than this. \"But one naturally wants to know more about\nsuch an example to all humanity.\"\n\n\"No doubt. But you must curb your curiosity, my dear; and imitation on\nyour part would be hopeless; you have got all this out of me by much\nperseverance; that implies patience, which you will have to exercise.\"\n\n\"Now can you suppose for one moment, George, in spite of all your\nself-confidence, that I would put up with such a thing as this? That an\nabstract idea of some divinity is to be my entire knowledge of my\nbrother's choice?\"\n\n\"I wish it could be otherwise, my dear child,\" I replied, with a warmth\nthat should have satisfied her; \"just for the present it must be so. The\nwhole thing is very strange, and complicated with many things most\nunusual. I am not a free agent, as the lawyers say; if a mysterious\nthing of some importance comes to my knowledge confidentially, am I to\npour it forth to everybody? You would be the very last, I am quite sure,\nto tempt me to anything dishonourable.\"\n\nI looked at her impressively, and felt certain that such an appeal must\nsilence her. She thought a little while, and then looked at me; and some\nflicker of a smile, which I could not altogether help, set her off\nagain, as if I were only talking humbug.\n\n\"You called me a tub just now; and this perfect and wonderful creature\nthat lives in the clouds is superior to all the Angels, but even a star\nmay look down into a tub, as they showed us the eclipse last summer. On\nthe other hand, the tub may look up at the star; but, George, can it\ntalk about the star? Come, that is a very sound argument now. You can't\nget out of that, do what you will. You are bound to tell me everything,\ndarling George, by the force of your own reasoning.\"\n\nNo other relative but a brother could have held out against such coaxing\nways. She came, and sat upon my knee, and touched me with a run-away\nglance (as a child does to a child before any cares come between them)\nand then brought the hollow of her temple into mine, as if to say--\"How\ncould I run away from you?\" And then with the freshness of her sweet\nhair falling round me (which brought into my mind at once our joyful\nromps together) she knew a great deal better than to visit me with\nsentimental lips, though they were quivering--for what man cares to kiss\nhis sister, except upon her forehead? But she, being up to all devices,\nfound I had a button off; and in the very place where it should have\nbeen, which happened to be very near my heart, there she laid her\nfingers trembling, and began to reproach herself instead of me.\n\n\"None of that!\" I said, with the powers of logic coming to my aid;\nalthough I defy any father, grandfather, or uncle to have so got out of\nit. \"Everybody knows how good you are. Well, well, do anything you like\nwith me.\"\n\n\"Now if it had only been somebody else, somebody who never can know\neverything about you, as your favourite sister does, would you have\ncalled her a humbug, George--to use one of your own sweet expressions?\nOr would you have said, 'Yes, you have a right to know, you ought to\nknow everything about my affairs. I should be unworthy of the name of\nman, if I kept any secrets from you, my dear.' And then what a help you\nwould have, as soon as ever--\"\n\n\"As soon as ever I had told her all about myself! How you do mix up\nthings! But this curiosity of yours is useless. I am compelled to\nmaintain strict silence, until certain important events have taken\nplace. Until--\"\n\n\"Why, it must be at least a Princess!\" Grace exclaimed, jumping up, and\nclapping her hands, and then walking, as if she had a ten-yard train\nbehind her; \"we must all be kept waiting, until the impending vacancy of\nthe throne occurs.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_Why, it must at least be a Princess._\"]\n\n\"Exactly so,\" I answered; for after that bit of impudence, and her look\nof contempt at the ceiling, she deserved to be driven to Bedlam by the\ngoads of curiosity; \"how clever of you! There is a throne in question,\nand one of the most ancient in the world. Well, I never should have\nthought you could hit the mark like that!\"\n\n\"I won't ask another thing. I would not hear it, if you told me. No, no,\nnot for Joe!\" Oh, what would have Tom Erricker have thought, if he had\nheard the dignified Grace thus indulging in slang? \"I am not going to\nhave my head chopped off, for prying into State-secrets. Who is the\nPrime-minister? He was to have taken Elfrida into supper, the other\nnight, but he didn't. Still I can apply to him, not to have my head\nchopped off. George, don't attempt to tell me anything more.\nSelf-preservation is Heaven's first law. But I don't see how this\nparish will be large enough for us. Ha! I see it now. How very stupid of\nme, that is what the Earl of Melladew is come for. Closeted--is not that\nthe right expression?--closeted with his Royal Highness, Prince George\nCranleigh, for some hours! You see that nothing escapes me. But I must\nbe more cautious.\"\n\n\"No hope, sweet child, of putting me into a passion. And if nothing\nescapes you, why should you ever ask a question?\"\n\nThis was enough to floor even a girl of the highest abilities, for\nnearly half a second; and as they seldom give more than that time to\ntheir thoughts, a man may almost calculate upon the skedaddle of his\nsister, unless she has at him again within that period. Not so with his\nwife, she will stick to her guns, having bigger ones, and knowing how to\nwork them. Grace skedaddled, as consistency required; but with a popgun\nover her shoulder.\n\n\"Alas, that we should have to watch my dear brother! He is so good and\nsoft--they will be sure to take him in.\"\n\nAt this I was exceedingly annoyed. So much so that, if dignity and\ntriumphant reason had allowed, I would even have called her back at\nonce, and challenged her to explain her words; which (as I said before)\nis the last thing they can do. However, upon second thoughts I found it\nwiser to leave her to herself, which would be a miserable self; when\nreflection, which is a liquid operation with every true woman, should\nhave set her straight again.\n\nBut, thanks be to the Lord, who has made us real men, and given us power\nto exert our brains, without pit-pat of the heart to distract them at\nevery pulse! Although I was not in the calmest mood for thinking,\nbecause I had never had such a row with Grace before (and she was a\ndarling soul, whenever she let her mind come afterwards), nevertheless\nmy road was clear enough before me. \"If I am to be watched,\" thought I,\n\"and everything is to be put upon a business footing, the sooner I\nassert myself the better. I have talked rather big perhaps, because she\nprovoked me, and I am bound to have something to show for it. I will\nstrike a stroke at once. I will go and see my Princess.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nINTERNATIONAL ELEMENTS\n\n\nBut, alas, this was easier said than done, like most things in this\nworld of words. When I had put myself into choice apparel, with hat and\ntie exhibiting my College colours--which we should have carried to the\nhead of the river, if fate had not swept me from the New College\nboat--and when I had impeached that fate again, for not affording me my\nbrother Harold's face, yet resolving to brazen it out, had appeared\ninside the lower door of St. Winifred's stronghold (which I knew how to\nopen by the owner's counsel)--instead of finding things in their wonted\npeace, orderly, picturesque, in statuesque repose, at a glance I\ndescried a very warlike change.\n\nThere was Stepan with a long gun, and cartridges enough in the bandoleer\non his braided frock to account for all the civic force, as well as half\nof Aldershot; and behind him a score of fellows no less martial. Both\nthe gigantic dogs were loose, and equally resolute against invasion;\neven little Allai was in a clump of trees, with a dagger as long as\nhimself in both hands, and his white teeth ground against all Albion.\n\nIn the name of wonder, what could be in the wind? Just like my luck of\ncourse it was, at a most important moment, to hit upon something far\nmore momentous to the very people I was come to move.\n\n\"Good Stepan, I pray thee to communicate unto me the signification of\nthe matters I behold.\" For I knew that this trusty Caucasian had picked\nup a bit of our language, and preferred the long bits. He rolled his\nfine eyes, which were big enough for mill-stones, and in his still\nbigger mind revolved the sounds which had vainly reached his ears. \"What\nare you up to now?\" I amended my enquiry; and having heard the milk-boy\nsay something to that tune, when they declined so much of heaven in his\ncans, he bowed his head magnificently, and said, \"All right.\"\n\nThis is the first consolation found by a foreigner in our language. It\nis courteous to ourselves as well, and shows confidence in our country.\n\n\"What a fool you are!\" I cried, with a Briton's low ingratitude; and\nthen I saw the stately figure of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar coming towards me. This king\nof the mountains looked as calm as if he had been girded with ancestral\nsnow. There was no sort of weapon in his broad white belt, and no menace\nworse than a hospitable smile upon his large fair countenance. He took\nme by both hands, with a tenderness for the left, which proved how kind\nhis memory was, and led the way to a seat beneath the ivied wall, and\nlooked at me as if he liked me.\n\n\"I have been expecting you for many days,\" he said; and nothing but a\nlittle turn of voice just here and there could have led one to suppose\nthat he was not of English birth; \"why have you never come to show me\nwhether I am a good physician?\"\n\nI gave him all true reasons, that I had been away, and occupied with a\nnumber of home cares when at home, and I spoke of my parents in a way\nwhich he approved; and then I was led on by his kindness so that I asked\nwhether he was quite at leisure.\n\n\"Even more than usual,\" he answered with a smile. \"We have stopped our\nlittle operations for the afternoon; because we have been admonished by\na kind friend that some little attack upon our place may be expected.\"\n\n\"Well, you are a cool hand!\" was almost upon my lips; but a glance at\nhim prevented any personal remark. He was not the sort of man to be\ndealt with thus. But I resolved at least to be straightforward with him.\n\n\"S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, I must not come here under false pretences. The fact is\nsimply this, and I wish to tell you first, for no blame can possibly\nattach to her, and I have not told her of it. But I love your daughter,\nDariel.\"\n\nHe looked at me with some surprise, but no sign of resentment; and I\nmet his clear gaze firmly, trying at the same time to look braver than I\nfelt, for he took a long time before he answered.\n\n\"Ah, you little know what you are bringing upon yourself. For the sake\nof your friends you must overcome--you must put it down at once; before\nit gets stronger, quench it. For the sake of all who love you, and all\nyour hopes in life, you must conquer it, abolish it, annihilate it. You\nare a man of strong will, if I have any knowledge of the English face.\"\nHis tone and manner were of friendly advice, rather than of stern\nforbiddance.\n\n\"I know my own mind on this subject,\" I replied, \"and nothing will alter\nit. Whatever the consequence may be to myself, I shall go on unless\nthere is fear of harming her.\"\n\n\"There is fear of harming her, very great fear of it. Perhaps you have\nthe right to know. That depends upon yourself. Tell me, for I am at a\nloss to understand, how long this has been, and how it can have\nhappened; for surely it is of short opportunity.\"\n\n\"That is true enough, and too true;\" for although it had been going on\nwith me for months, there had not been half the opportunities I longed\nfor; \"but it has been growing very rapidly, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, although there\nhave been so few interviews, and the first of them quite a one-sided\none. In fact I have had very little chance as yet--one occasion I lost\naltogether, and I did not make the best of another. Oh, no, I have\nscarcely had any proper chances yet.\"\n\n\"Be thankful that it is so, my friend. It will be my duty to prevent\ntheir increase.\" Dariel's father smiled at his own words, with a sense\nof humour which I did not share. \"But just have the kindness, for I have\nthe right to know, to tell me how there can have been any interviews at\nall. My daughter has been brought up in England mainly, and resembles in\nmany points an English young lady, rather than a Lesghian; but----\"\n\n\"It has never been any fault of hers at all. Altogether my fault, what\nlittle fault there has been. But I hope, if you don't encourage me, S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar, you will take good care not to let anybody else.\"\n\n\"That is rather a surprising demand;\" he spoke so gravely that it was\nmy turn to smile at the modesty of my own request. \"Because you are\nprohibited, all the world must be so. But tell me how you fell into this\nsad mishap.\"\n\n\"That I shall never consider it, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, however hopeless my prospect\nmay be. Already I feel that my life has been exalted, my standard\nelevated, my character in every way----\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hurry you, Mr. Cranleigh, in the course of your\nself-congratulations; but some invasion of our refuge may be expected\nnow at almost any moment. And afterwards there may not be good\nopportunity of speaking.\"\n\nThereupon I told him, as briefly as I could, how my admiration first\nbegan, and how it had become entire devotion, in spite of the niggardly\noccasions it had found, and that now I set before me but one object in\nthe world, and cared not for obstacles, denials, scruples, opinion of\nothers, or perdition of myself--in for it I was, and go through with it\nI would. Then he stopped me, as if I spoke at random.\n\n\"Did you begin it, sir, in this lofty manner? Were all these fine\nsentiments already in your mind, when you peeped through the hedge at my\ndaughter?\"\n\n\"Sir, you exaggerate that small proceeding; and I am not a bit ashamed\nof it now,\" I replied, \"because of the glorious results it has\nproduced.\"\n\n\"I am a little inclined to think that I hear a thumping\"--in my heart\nthere was one of the biggest thumpings ever known, as I defied him thus,\nand he disarmed me in that manner. \"Is it the arrival of your Civic\nForce?\"\n\nThe Peelers, the Coppers, the Bobbies, there they were, beyond all\ndoubt; and I believe that I shall pay the Police-rate--our tribute to\nthe powers invisible--for the rest of my life without a growl, because\nof the moment of their knocking at that door.\n\n\"Stop, sir,\" I shouted, as the Prince was marching off, in his leisurely\nstyle--for nothing ever made him hurry--\"there is one thing I have\nforgotten. Fasten up the dogs. I was ordered especially to tell you\nthat; otherwise the poor things may be shot.\"\n\n\"Dogs must take their chance in a conflict of mankind. But I leave them\nto you, Mr. Cranleigh.\" I knew not then that the true Caucasian is never\nbrought up to love animals, and I wondered to find him so unjust. If a\nman likes to rush into a conflict, well and good. But to let a dog\nsacrifice himself to loyal feeling, appears to me unrighteous on the\nmaster's part. So I ran for my life, and caught _Kuban_ and _Orla_ (who\nwould have rushed point-blank at the muzzle of a cannon), and with much\ndifficulty, and some help, thumped them into their kennels.\n\nMeanwhile the kicking at the upper door, and the shouting of hoarse\nvoices, and the hoisting of coned heads between the ivied battlements,\nwere waxing every moment; and so was the ferocity of the warriors\ninside, who had not enjoyed a fight, perhaps, ever since they came to\nEngland, the country of policemen, who mainly beat white gloves. But the\nmaster of the place ordered all his henchmen back, and made them stand\ntheir murderous guns against the peaceful ivy.\n\nThen he swang on its pivot the bar of the door, which had been\nreadjusted since Slemmick dashed through, and throwing it wide he stood\namong the foes, and spoke.\n\n\"This is a very great commotion you are raising. Is there law in this\nland, that such things are allowed?\"\n\nWe beheld a large force of constables outside, as if much resistance had\nbeen expected; and some of the mounted police were present to intercept\nany runaway. \"Sir, there is law in the land; and under it I hold a\nsearch-warrant of these premises, with orders to arrest all persons\nhere, in case of certain discoveries. Sergeant, you will see that no one\nleaves the place, without my permission. Now, sir.\"\n\nExhibiting his warrant, the chief officer fixed keen eyes upon S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar's face, and scanned with stern suspicion the tranquil smile and the\nvery peaceful aspect. \"To the mill first! To the mill at once!\" he\nshouted, with some show of temper, being annoyed, as I could see, by the\ncalmness of this reception. \"Sir, will you have the kindness to inform\nme, why the mill is not at work, as usual?\"\n\n\"It was scarcely worth while, when I expected you, to begin work, and\nthen be interrupted.\"\n\n\"You expected me, sir? What the devil do you mean?\" cried the officer,\nas one in a fury.\n\n\"For some little time,\" S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar answered, with one of his most majestic\nbows, \"I have looked forward to this pleasure; but until this morning I\ncould not be sure of the hour most convenient to you. But according to a\nproverb of your country, 'better late than never,' sir. The mill is at\nyour service, and all that it contains. I have also provided some\nrefreshment for your men. Not such as I could wish, but what you call\n'rough and ready.'\"\n\n\"And you have laid it out in the mill! The very place we were to have\nbroken up! Of course, you have had time to clear everything away. It is\na farce, sir, a farce, to carry out our orders now.\"\n\n\"It would be that at any time, for you never should have received them.\nThere is in this country, though the constitution is the noblest in the\nworld--which generally means the least corrupt--very imperfect\ncommunication between the working departments. Perhaps you will\nencourage your men to search; while I am proving it needless. That would\nbe of a piece with your other arrangements. That is not your style of\nbusiness? Nay, but feeding is. I perceive that your men have walked far,\ngood sir. I entreat you to let them recruit their strength. Stepan,\nbring two more chairs this way. Gentlemen, I hope that you can manage\nroast-beef cold. If the date had been more definite, we could have shown\nmore hospitality.\"\n\n\"These things are beyond my understanding,\" said the officer, gazing at\nhis men, who stood strictly at attention, with eyes very right for the\ngreat sirloin; \"I have never been more astonished in my life. Will you\ngive me your word, sir, that no one shall leave the place? Then I see no\ngood reason against a little refreshment, while you are explaining this\nstrange state of things to me. Members of the Force, all fall to! Ha,\nwhat perfect discipline!\"\n\nI scarcely know when I have been more pleased, in my little way of\nregarding things, than I was at that moment to see everybody converted\nfrom the track of war, as one might say, to the course, or (as might be\nconsidered even better, when the fork takes its place as the knife's\nbetter half) the chairs--the comfortable dining-chairs of peace. Gallant\nas any known soldier on the globe, which can show more varieties of them\nthan of soil or climate, is the true British Peeler in quest of\npromotion; and these were all picked men, as they soon began to prove;\nand a warm sense of Providence arose within me, at the privilege of\nseeing them pitch into the victuals, instead of storming Caucasus.\n\n\"I am not intelligent of British manners,\" quoth S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar to the chief\nofficer, \"as if I had the honour, sir, of belonging to your island. But\nso far as a foreigner may understand your race, I trust that they will\nmake progress now.\"\n\n\"Like a house on fire,\" replied the officer, with a bow, and perhaps\nsome inclination to do better with his lips, than discipline as yet\nencouraged. \"Sir, I understood that you were going to show me\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Sir, in my native land we have a manner, suggested perhaps by the\nrigour of the climate, of producing a savoury broil at short notice.\nMeasures to that effect were taken upon your first application at my\ndoor; and if you will do me the honour of coming to my room, I would ask\nfor the advantage of your opinion on that subject. I trust that Mr.\nGeorge Cranleigh will join us.\"\n\n\"Mr. Cranleigh! Is this Sir Harold Cranleigh's son?\" the officer\nenquired, and a very gentlemanlike expression, which had been dawning on\nhis austere features, became established there for the rest of the day.\n\"After you, sir. After you!\" with a bow that did credit to the Force, he\nprotested; and soon he held his own in a spirited discussion upon the\nmost effective form discovered for a carving-knife.\n\n\"Well, sir, what report am I to make?\" he asked, in a very proper frame\nof mind, when now there was little left, and still less wanted;\n\"according to instructions, made strict search of suspected premises,\nencountered no resistance, found nothing in contravention of the law,\nbut excellent dinner prepared for us. Embraced the opportunity,\naccording to precept and example of superior officers; found no\noccasion to take any one in charge, and know no more than we knew\nbefore.\"\n\n\"You shall know more than you knew before. You shall not return without\nperfect satisfaction as to the question which brought you here. You have\nexhibited the common-sense, the self-restraint, and the consideration\nwhich English officials alone display. You perceived that it would be\nwhat you call a farce, to search the suspected premises, when you found\nthat your visit was expected. But the gendarmery of any other country\nwould have wreaked their anger and disappointment upon the suspected\nobjects. They would have shattered my machinery, sir; and that would\nhave been a heavy blow to me. I have naturally been indignant at the low\nsuspicions entertained of me. Otherwise I would have routed them, by\nreferring your chiefs to the Foreign Office. One word there would have\nsaved all this trouble. But now you shall understand this mighty secret;\nand so shall Mr. Cranleigh, if he cares to know it.\"\n\nWith these words our kind host left the table, and crossed the room to a\nlarge cupboard, which he unlocked, and took from it a box containing\nthings that jingled. This box he placed between us with the cover off,\nand we saw a quantity of small metallic objects, of very queer forms and\nvarious construction, like pieces of a Chinese puzzle. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar stood\nregarding us with a smile; for he saw that neither of us was a whit the\nwiser.\n\n\"Those are the products of my mill,\" he said; \"no very portentous\nsecret; but it might be fatal to my object, if my little scheme were to\nfind its way prematurely into the public Press. Therefore, I will ask\nyou, Mr. Officer, not to enter this in your report, though you are at\nliberty to mention it in confidence to your chief. Mr. Cranleigh, I am\nsure, will not speak of it at all, if I put it to him so. Now, what do\nyou call these little things?\"\n\n\"Couldn't guess to save my life,\" the officer replied, as he fingered\none or two; \"artificial insects, spiders, tadpoles, shrimps, or\ndragon-flies--no, that won't do; I give it up, Sir Imar.\"\n\n\"I know what it is,\" I said, not by any stroke of genius, but through my\nbrother's workshop; \"it is all of it type, of some queer sort, but what\nthe metal is I have not the least idea.\"\n\n\"Type it is, as you perceive. But to what language it belongs, I doubt\nwhether even the British Museum could tell you. For the very simple\nreason that nothing has been printed in that language yet. It is type of\nthe Lesghian alphabet, the first that has ever been cut, or cast, or in\nany other manner fashioned. Our language is a very fine one, infinitely\nthe finest of all the forms of speech in the long tract of mountains.\nBut nothing in it has been printed yet. We are obliged to have recourse\nto Arabic, if we desire to publish anything. And not only that, but the\nchildren even of our noblest families have not the least idea--Officer,\nI see that you are pressed for time; but if you had leisure to see me\nwork this press, not with those castings, but the larger form, the\ncapitals in fact, the coarse capitals, which we turned out first,--for\nwe had to feel our way,--I am almost sure that you would agree with\nme--\"\n\n\"I am sure that I should, sir. No doubt about that. I never saw anything\nso beautiful in my life. But we have exceeded our time, Sir Imar. Thank\nyou--well, I will taste a toss of that liqueur. Upon my word, you know\nthe right thing all round! Sir Imar, your best health! Trappistine is\nnot a patch on it. Beg pardon, Sir Imar, for having hit your gate so\nhard. I am not quite a literary man myself, but am able to allow for all\nin that way situated. Good-bye, Sir Imar, and if any one encroaches upon\nthe freedom of the Press, for the folk about here are not like us, just\none line to Scotland Yard--a cigar, sir? Yes, it will enable me to\nthink. And I shall take that young fellow's horse back to the station.\"\n\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar sat down, while I went to see them off; and outside the upper\ndoor they gave three cheers. \"Wonderful old chap! Grand old cock!\" the\nofficer said to me as I offered him a light; \"English Aristocracy not a\npatch upon him for cooking a dinner or for languages. But as mad as a\nMarch hare; what a pity! Don't he know what is good, though? Mr.\nCranleigh, attend to me. A man who can do French things to satisfy an\nEnglishman--that's what I call international, and no mistake!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nPEPPERCORNS\n\n\nBefore I went away, which I was obliged to do without even a glimpse of\nDariel, her father very kindly put this question to me, \"Do you really\nwish to know more, my friend, of the scheme which has brought me to this\nlonely valley, and kept me occupied here so long, in the hope that I may\nbe of service to the race which has trusted and loved me, but received\nfrom me as yet no better reward than disaster and war? You are eager to\nbe told? Then if you can come on Saturday, when the work of the day has\nbeen accomplished, you shall hear, not of that alone, but of things\nwhich have befallen me, from which you will perceive most clearly that\nthe greater the distance preserved henceforth between Mr. Cranleigh and\nall Caucasians, the better it will be for his welfare and that of all\nhis relations.\"\n\nNow it is useless for me to trouble anybody, even if anybody would be\ntroubled, with all the wild thoughts that came into my head, and all the\nsad things that would not let my heart alone, as I went with this burden\nof doubt to bear. It must not be supposed for a moment, because I have\nchanced not to touch upon the matter, that I had cast away all sense of\nduty to my relatives in this adventure. The home, and the farm, and the\nwelfare of the family had not been impaired by a single penny, through\nwhat some might call the distraction of my mind. Only let every one\nattend to business, as I had never failed to do all this time, and what\na different place the world would be! And as for disturbing my father\nand mother, with any description of what had happened to myself, when\nthe chances were that all of it would come to nothing--that would indeed\nhave been a wicked thing to do, in spite of all their preference for\nHarold.\n\nSo clear was I from doubt upon that score, and all my proceedings had\nbeen so blameless, ever since that casual \"peep through the hedge,\"--as\nDariel's father called it,--that instead of any squeamishness or\nself-reproach, I had two points to dwell upon of maltreatment to myself.\nWhy had I been sent to London on a special errand, and then deprived of\nall chance of completing it? And again, had I been told of that hateful\nPrince Hafer, and purposely goaded into just wrath against him, simply\nthat I might break forth into rude behaviour, and so be dismissed as a\nsavage, who could not control himself before a lady?\n\nThat supposition was too wretched to be borne with, not for the low\nesteem of me it implied, but rather on account of the paltriness imputed\nto the highest, and noblest, and loveliest of her sex. Against all that\nmy truer mind revolted, and my own experience did the like. But men have\na trick of saying such small things about women (when the feminine back\nis turned), partly because they think it lofty so to speak, and partly\nbecause of the poets and sages who have set them this example, and\npartly (a very small part, let us hope) in right of their own\nexperience. And these things come into a man's lower mind, when\ndepression sinks it in the mud-deposits of the heart.\n\n\"Halloa, George Cranleigh! What a blue study you must be in! Don't I\ncarry a light at my fore-peak? And if you can't see it you might smell\nit.\"\n\nIt was rather dark as I came near home, after that interview with the\npolice, and the trees at the back of the Hall were thick; but I might\nhave seen Stoneman and his cigar, if I had been at all on the lookout.\n\"Come in,\" he went on; \"I waylaid you because I want a chat with you\nmost uncommonly, and they told me at your den that you were gone this\nway. Fishing again? No rod this time! But perhaps you leave it at some\nfarmhouse.\" This man had his little faults; and among them was a trick\nof suggesting a handy fib, and then smashing it, if adopted; the which\nis not a friendly trick. \"Not been fishing, eh? Something better, I\ndaresay. Well, come in here; I want to show you something good, and the\nwonderful fellow who does it.\"\n\nThis was as dark as the sky itself to me. But I followed him, for he was\na leading man; and in little matters I submit my steps to theirs.\nVerily, on this occasion I did not walk amiss. For when we were in\nJackson Stoneman's little crib, such as any man of nous, with a big roof\nover his head, is fain to keep for his own better moments, there was\nsomething which no magnificence can bring home into the simple human\nbreast. Who is the most delightful writer of our race, since Heaven took\nShakespeare away in hot haste, when his hand was too close on the Tree\nof Life? The answer, although so long in coming, comes louder, as every\nyear adds to the echo--\"William Makepeace Thackeray.\"\n\nThat man of vast brain, with the fresh heart of a child, would have been\npleased to see what I beheld; and his tender touch only could have\ntouched it off. A bright fire was burning in a low, plain grate, there\nwas not a whiff of smoke throughout it, and in front of the red clear\nglow, at a distance nicely calculated, stood a beautiful machine with\nits back to us. Kneeling on the rug was a long-sided man, so intent on\nhis work that he never heard the door, with a silver spoon (once\napostolic perhaps) in his right hand, and a long slender crook in his\nleft. What he was tending could not be seen as yet; but a glorious\nfragrance held possession of the air, and wafted a divine afflatus to\nany heart not utterly insensible. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's broil was not a patch upon\nit.\n\n\"Ach! it is to spoil everyting dat you are here.\" The artist frowned and\ngrunted, without getting up, as Stoneman introduced me. \"My name is\nHopmann; but dese bairds, what will dere names be, if I interrupt?\"\n\nPeeping in over the lid of the alcove, which had an enamel lining, I saw\nfour partridges hung skilfully from hooks, with a swivel to each; so\nthat every bird might revolve with zeal, or pause with proper feeling,\nas his sense of perfection and of duty bade him. While in the tray\nbeneath them, some clear brown gravy was simmering, with a beaded eddy\nwhere the basting trickled. In and out among them, the silver spoon was\ngliding most skilfully and impartially, administering a drip to each,\nas sweetly and fairly as their own dear mother did it, in their happy\nnest. But instead of their dear mother, alas, it was not even an\nEnglishman who was tending them, but a German doctor with a very red\nface, gazing most severely at them through big silver spectacles. \"Not\nyou look! Not you come near!\" this gentleman cried, as he gave me a\npush, in return for the bow I offered him.\n\n\"Come in here, George,\" said Stoneman, with a wink at me. \"Let him\nalone, and I will tell you all about him. He is the best fellow that\never lived; but you will never get it out of his head that almost\neverything we do is wrong.\"\n\n\"Everyting, everyting! Not almost, but everyting the Englishman do\nwrong,\" the Herr Doctor shouted, as Stoneman led me into the next room,\nwhere a snug supper-table was set out for the three of us.\n\n\"Rather a queer customer, isn't he?\" said my host; \"but I have known him\nmore than ten years now, and got ten times as fond of him every year. He\nis the kindest-hearted fellow I ever came across; and there is scarcely\nanything he cannot do. He is well-known in London; he might be Professor\nof this, that, and the other. But he has not a particle of ambition,\nthough he values his profession mightily. He is fond of money, of\ncourse; but chiefly for the sake of his widowed mother, and two sisters\nwhom he supports. You know that old Chalker of Cobstone Hill went the\nway of all flesh last month, leaving a large practice, all abroad. Well,\nI persuaded Hopmann to take to it, for they were paying him shamefully\nin London, for a lot of work at one of the hospitals. He has only been\nhere about a fortnight yet, but he is sure to get on; he must get on;\nnothing comes amiss to him. And I want you to help him, wherever you\ncan: you need have no fear, he is quite tip-top--too good a great deal\nfor a country practice. But he would never do in London; he is too\nhonest--sees through any humbug in a moment, and would tell the patient\nso, though he were of the Royal family. But you should see Hopmann with\nsome old woman, who will never say 'thank you,' or pay him sixpence.\nThat is what I admire in a man; and that tells for him too in the end,\nyou may be sure. But come along, he is calling us, and he will be in a\nfury, if we let all his beautiful cookery spoil. All right, Hopmann, hop\nalong, old fellow. A metal dish apiece for us, piping hot.\"\n\n\"And ze last baird, he stay here and keep hot himself! And he become ze\nproperty of ze first gent zat is ready. Now, Mr. Cranleigh, you tell\ntruth! You never taste bartrich before. For why? Because you cannot cook\nthem in this land. You take away everyting that gives what you call ze\nflavour, that penetrates ze whole system of ze baird. Ach! I will cook\nagain for you, you shall see. Shackson is not half so wise.\"\n\nI was fortunate enough to please him, and not in words alone, for the\neffect of my bit of lunch had quite worn off. In a very short time (as\nhappens now and then when two men widely different in their main lines\nmeet) our little corners, which are the clinging points, had fitted very\nnicely into one another; and I longed to know more of the man, because I\nknew so much of him already. For who cares to get nearer to a man who\nkeeps his distance?\n\n\"Hopmann is a queer fellow in his way, but in a very good sort of a\nway,\" said Jackson Stoneman, as we two filled our pipes, and he lit his\nhalf-a-crown cigar, which I would not have smoked for half-a-crown; \"I\nam glad to see you enter into each other's merits. Now, will you fall in\nwith a little plan which I have conceived for the good of us all? My\nGerman friend is an excellent shot. He can knock a bird over, as well as\nhe can cook it. He was out with us on the first, when George Cranleigh\nwould not come. Two or three swells were inclined to laugh, but he very\nsoon turned the laugh on them. Garrod said that he never saw such a\nhand, which was not very graceful to the man who pays his wages. I have\nnot yet found anything that Hopmann cannot do.\"\n\n\"Shackson, there are two tings vot he cannot do. He cannot ride very\nwell ze horse, and he cannot listen to his own braises.\"\n\n\"Never mind, he will very soon learn both accomplishments, and then he\nwill be absolutely perfect. But we have a little campaign in view for\nthe day after to-morrow. We have only been round the outskirts yet, we\nhave not touched the best part of the shooting. Herr Doctor, will you\ncome with your 16-bore, that wiped the eye of several of our thundering\ntwelves, and show us straight powder on Thursday?\"\n\n\"I vill only come on ze onderstandings of before--that all ze bairds I\ndo shoot shall belong to me, to take home.\"\n\n\"You shall carry off, and cook with their trails in, every blessed bird\nyou knock over. And now about you, George. I have never seen you shoot,\nbut I hear you are very good. Are you afraid to try your hand against\nthis mighty German?\"\n\nThis put me a little on my mettle, as was meant. Not that I ever cared\nto shoot in competition; for that, as with fishing or any other friendly\nsport, to my mind kills the enjoyment. Moreover I had refused Stoneman's\ninvitation, from a sort of pride--a very false pride it might be--about\nwalking by his leave upon land that had been ours. And I had taken no\ncertificate this year.\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" I said. \"I won't bring my gun, for I have\ntaken no licence, and I would not shoot without. But I'll come and work\nthe dogs for you; they know me as well as they know Garrod, and I shall\nenjoy it quite as much.\"\n\n\"But Hopmann has taken no licence, either. As if any one would dare to\nask you about that, for shooting round here! I should like to see them\nask him even, when he is with me.\"\n\n\"For me it is to my conscience so,\"--the German had a great gift of\nwinking both eyes, through his spectacles, with rapid alternation; \"I am\nnot a subject of this realm. I make game of ze Game-laws.\"\n\nHowever, I was not to be persuaded; and when the day came, there were\nguns enough without mine, and far too many, as it seemed to me, for a\nfree beat and small enclosure. Luckily there was no covert-shooting yet;\nbut one or two of the dogs had most narrow escapes, and I was obliged to\ninterfere sometimes, and declare that I would walk them all back to\nkennel, unless the men tried to be more careful. One dog was my own, a\nvery handsome lemon-and-white setter-bitch, who dropped to shot almost\nbefore you could see the smoke; and yet somebody put a shot through her\near, though I did not find it out till afterwards, or home she would\nhave gone, whatever they might think at losing the best of the bunch, as\none might say.\n\nFor there were six guns, sometimes close together,--a dangerous affair\nfor a country like that, even when every man knows his neighbour, and\neach is an experienced and careful shot; most Cockneyfied too, for the\nlook of the thing; and I had a great mind to keep away from them. But\nStoneman would not hear of that; he had invited Lord Melladew, so he\nsaid, purely as a compliment to me, and how could I refuse to come with\nhim? To this I could make no reply, being taken up with my own affairs\nto such a degree that I was not at home concerning other people's\ndoings. The young Earl of Melladew was staying at the \"Bell,\"--which\nused to be called the \"Cranleigh Arms,\" until we went down in the\nworld,--and there he had his valet, and artistic outfit, and all his\nlarge ideas, in the long room with the magnificent view, where our\ntenant used to dry his onions. Now I am the very last to say a word\nagainst people who have gone up in life, by merits which have been\ndenied to us. The first peer had proved himself a fine man of business,\nand made an exemplary fortune by lucrative Army-contracts during the\nCrimean war. If he compressed some dead cows in his hay, and compelled\nhis old sheep-dogs to serve their time still by posthumous fidelity in\nthe form of mutton,--as war correspondents on very short commons were\nungrateful enough at that time to aver,--all those and greater errors he\nhad redeemed by having a grandson as unlike him as possible.\n\nThis young nobleman (for so he might be called) had many very excellent\nand amiable points. He was gentle, generous, and upright, more eager to\nplease than is altogether safe, except in a very rustic neighbourhood;\nand even less conceited and affected in his manners than a young man of\ngood looks, fair position, and literary tendencies ought to be, for his\nfriends to consider him natural. Everybody in our village said that\nwithout Farmer Jarge to certify it, they never could have taken his\nLordship for a Lord; though, considering the Boards, and the Hy\u00c3\u00a6nas this\nand that, and the Parson that couldn't turn his coat-tails up till a\nsecondary motion put him into his own chair in the Vestry, there was no\ncall for any one to feel surprise if the great folk came down, and made\nthe little ones go up. Lord Melladew also was enthusiastic as to the\ndelights of country-life, and the glories of British industry; and this\nhelped him much with my sister, who never could understand why we should\nbe starved by foreign produce, when the land, and the people, and the\nsky above our heads were exactly the same as she could remember always,\nand there was as much to pay for everything as ever.\n\nBut our young nobleman proved most clearly, with an elegant sonnet in\nthe \"Cobham Comet,\" entitled \"Sit down to your own desserts,\" that\nprosperity was to return to our land, and the Frenchman and Belgian be\nblown away by volleys of grape and apple shot from the bulwark of\nBritain at Farmer Bandilow's farm. Half a million fruit-trees would be\nplanted in October, and ten million bushels of apples, melons, peaches,\nplums, grapes, pine-apples, apricots, pears, &c., would confront the\npoor foreigner next August if he dared to attempt a landing.\n\nMy father was scarcely so sanguine, but said, \"Let them have their try,\nGeorge, if rich people find the money. Things can be no worse, and some\npoor fellows may find employment for the winter. Perhaps Mr. Stoneman\nwill take it up.\"\n\nStoneman, however, instead of doing that, showed an unaccountable\ncontempt and bitterness, not only towards the scheme itself, but all who\ntook any share in it. There seemed to be something in the matter that\ntouched him far more closely than any question of agriculture. Was it\nLord Melladew's long sojourn at the \"Bell,\" and his frequent visits at\nour cottage? Even now, with this young man his guest for the day, and\nbehaving most inoffensively, the grim stockbroker marched on in such a\nmanner, that I thought it my duty to remonstrate. \"You haven't shot him\nyet,\" I said, as we stood behind the others, \"because it is not dark\nenough. But if he gets peppered in the dusk, I shall know whose pot it\ncame from.\"\n\nStoneman gave me a grin, and behaved a little better, and did his best\nto be polite at luncheon-time, and after the narrow shaves of the\nmorning things went on more carefully; for the men who knew nothing\nabout a gun had now learned to be afraid of it. Until, with the sun\ngetting low behind a wood, we came to a bit of gorse-land having a steep\nfall towards a valley, favourite harbour for a fox, in the days when my\nchief business was such pleasant sport and jollity. There were narrow\nrides cut through the furze down hill, and across them tussocks of\nwelted fern, and strigs of moots that cropped up again, after the\nfuelling had been cleared.\n\n\"Why, this is the place where the yellow bunnies live,\" said Stoneman,\nas he opened a gate for us, and we stood on the crest of the furzy\nslope. \"I know a man, and a clever fellow too, who has offered a guinea\napiece for them. He has given up business, and set up his staff in a\nwild part of Wales; and there he is going in for a breed of these yellow\nrabbits. He has got a big name for the fur, and expects to cut out\nChinchilla with it. I have heard of our golden bunnies lots of times,\nand seen some of them once or twice. Shall we get a sample for him, and\nthen offer him live bunnies, if he jumps at it?\"\n\nAll agreed cheerfully to this, and the dogs were taken up, while the\nmen, peeping down the steep ridges, got a shot or two at any of the\nconey race who might be dining carelessly. Then, as all of these proved\nto be of the common grey sort, Garrod's boy was sent home for a couple\nof rough terriers, to run the furze thickets, while the guns should\nwatch the rides, for two or three yellow fellows had skipped away\nunscathed.\n\nThat boy took a long time in carrying out his message, and when he came\nback with his father behind him, the dusk of September was settling in\nthe valley, while a wisp of silvery vapour stole along the brown\nhalberds of the gorse, and the russet clumps of bramble. But the\nhillside now was ringing with the merry yelps of dogs, or the squeak of\nsome puppy in a tangled grip, while the low covert ruffled, or was\nchannelled here and there, with the sway of some resolute terrier hot in\nchase.\n\nThis holiday had been a rare enjoyment to me, though crossed with\nanxiety now and then, among so many barrels governed less by experience\nthan excitement. Most of all, as I said, about Lord Melladew, who strode\nalong so poetically, clad in green velveteen, beautifully made, but\nterminating unluckily in very smart buff gaiters short and\nspruce--concerning him I had prayed all day that he were safe back in\nthe onion loft. Not that he carried a gun to his own disadvantage as the\nreckless do, neither did he fire at random, but was well content, in the\nmanner of the public, to shout according to the hit or miss.\n\n\"Shut up all,\" I called out sharply; \"too dark, too dark! I expect to\nsee at least a dog shot, every moment.\"\n\nA dog indeed! If I had said a man, and that man a live Earl--for bang,\nbang, went the guns, just as if I had never spoken, and four or five\npuffs of smoke, as if the hillside were on fire, rose from the avenues\npoor bunny had to cross. \"Yellow! Did you see, Shorje? yellow as ze gold\nis!\" The German doctor shouted as he pointed down a ride. \"Shackson shot\ntoo, but ze rabbit is to me. I will have ze guinea. Ach, mein Gott!\"\n\nInstead of a rabbit giving the last kick of death, what did we see\nhalf-way down the slope but two buff coneys flying ever so much faster\nthan any coney ever flew before, each flashing in front of each other,\nas if father fox were after both of them. \"I am blowed if it isn't my\nLord,\" cried Garrod; \"the foreigner have shot him morshial!\"\n\n\"Vat you know, ze clods-having-to-hop-by-night-as-well-as-by-day fe-loe?\nBut keep your business, good fe-loe. If I have put ze shot in, I can\npull him out again. You shall see.\"\n\nGuns were laid aside, and the doctor left there (for he seemed to make\nnothing of peppering a lord, in comparison with basting partridges), and\ndown the steep pitch we raced after the Earl, who with a long start was\ngoing like the wind. Do all we might, we could not get near him, until\nhe was brought up by a heavy post and rail, where the Dorking road winds\nalong the bottom. There he struck his chest, and in spite of being\nwinded, did no small credit to his lungs, by a power of shrieks that\nrent the valley.\n\n\"What a coward!\" cried Stoneman, who had kept up with me, though we both\nhad \"gone croppers\" once or twice. \"He is all there for holloaing, at\nany rate!\"\n\nBut the worst of the business was yet to come. As we drew a pull of\nbreath, before rushing to the rescue, we heard a sudden clatter in the\nroad below, then we saw a wild dash of something dark, and a woman lay\non her back under a low tree. I leaped the rail fence, to which the Earl\nwas still clinging, and there lay my sister Grace, in her riding-habit,\nwhile the sound of the runaway pony's hoofs came clanging round the\ncorner.\n\nI lifted my darling sister Grace, and set her against the hedge-bank,\nand my heart went out of me, as I knelt and whispered to her. If it had\nbeen even Dariel, could my terror have been so terrible? I pulled her\nriding-gloves off, and found a penny in them, the change the dear frugal\nsoul had taken from the last turnpike gate she paid. And then when I saw\nher sweet kind face as white as a shroud, and the bright eyes closed,\nand the long black lashes that I used to vow she dyed--when I wanted to\nput her in a passion--lying upon the waxen cheeks, without caring a dump\nwhat any other chap might think, I lifted up my voice and wept.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Her sweet kind face as white as a shroud._\"]\n\n\"Shush, shush, don't be a fool, Shorje,\" said some fellow, pushing me\naway; \"ze gairl is only what you called shtunned. All raight, all\nraight, in ten skips of ze vlea. My tear, I am ze dochtor.\"\n\nI went across the road, and stood by Jackson Stoneman, who was standing\nas firm as a rock, and pretending to play with the whip he had picked\nup. \"Look here,\" I said, \"she will never pay another pike.\"\n\n\"Take a turn with me, my dear fellow,\" he replied; \"Hopmann will get on\nbetter without us. My housekeeper's mother lives round the corner.\nThough the Lord knows that if all we want is a woman-- Lord Melladew, I\nam so sorry for your little accident. You mustn't wear yellow spats, the\nnext time you go shooting. Garrod will help you to your inn, and the\ndoctor will come, when he has seen to this more urgent case. Garrod, let\nhis lordship throw all his weight on you. Stop a moment. Send your boy\nat full speed to 'The Bell,' and order their low four-wheeler here. He\nis not to say why, for fear of frightening Lady Cranleigh. And let him\ntake that villain of a pony to 'The Bell.'\"\n\nIn less than an hour, I had the great joy of hearing that Grace was\nquite conscious, and had no limbs broken, nor any other injury that a\nfew days would not cure. When the pony bolted at the shrieks and kicks\nand swaying figure of his lordship, a branch across the road had swept\nmy sister from the saddle, but luckily it did not strike any vulnerable\npart, unless the part that often wounds a man is such. In a word it was\nher lump of hair, or what ladies call their _chignon_, into which she\nwas obliged to coil her tresses tight for riding, that received the\nimpact of the too obtrusive tree. But I scarcely knew what to conclude\nabout the doctor, or Stoneman himself, who had been so uneasy about a\nyoung Earl hanging out so near our Grace, when, as sure as English words\nwere ever uttered by a German, I heard Hopmann whisper this condolence\nto himself--\"Zat was ze graidest shot as ever I did make. One fire,\nleetle bepper, bring me down two bagients.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA LOVEBIRD\n\n\nThus again, without any effort of his own, was the clever stockbroker\nquit of rivalry; for although the Earl did not leave the village for\nsome weeks, he was not in a condition to do much poetic wooing, even if\nhe could have found a partner. And this was not the only good result\nfrom that serious double accident; for the necessity of daily enquiry at\nour cottage became so pressing, and Stoneman so gallantly rose to this\noccasion, that the stiffness and coldness which had hitherto marked my\nmother's reception of him could no longer be maintained, but glided very\nquietly into goodwill and gratitude. All of us began to forgive him,\nmore and more, for the crime of not belonging to an ancient county\nfamily, while the merits of his affluence almost drove us to maintain\nthem against his own indifference.\n\n\"You go along,\" I said, for I had come to know him now, and could talk\nof his cash without tapping at it; \"you know as well as I do, that the\nfirst consideration with nine out of ten of us is--Money.\"\n\n\"I am afraid it is,\" he answered, as he stopped to make a bow, across a\nthousand cobblestones, to my sister, who was descending from the sky no\ndoubt to attend to her milk-pans, and to know of nothing else; \"I am\nafraid it is, with those who have not got it; and there is a great deal\nto be said for them. But I should be ashamed if it were so, with those\nwho have obtained it. Moreover, it would be contrary to human nature,\nfor does any man value a thing that is his own? As long as it seems\nbeyond his reach, it is all that is lovely and charming; but the moment\nhe has reduced the _chose in action_, as the lawyers express it, into\npossession, all its glory is gone, till he loses it again.\"\n\n\"Very well. There is your _chose in action_ over there.\" I pointed to\nthe dairy window. \"I shall take care to tell her how you mean to\nestimate her, if ever she becomes your property.\"\n\n\"For Heaven's sake,\" he cried, while he caught me by the sleeve, as if I\nwere going straightway to denounce him, \"don't suppose that such impious\ndoctrines apply to--to the one exception of all human laws.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that they do, and ever so much quicker than they apply to\nmoney. But once more, when are you going to try your luck?\"\n\nFor he had pestered me perpetually about his feelings now, and I had\nadvised him not to be in too much of a hurry. I felt that he was further\non than I was, in acquaintance with the lovely object; for he must have\nhad about thirty opportunities, to my three, counting dog-dialogues and\neverything. But he had not done half so much as I had; and women are\nwise enough to take one deed deeper to the dear heart, than a hundred\nthousand words. In fact, it is difficult to get that out again, if done\nby a man of the right age and manner, and if they were sensitive just\nthen with fright. The thought of this bore me up against friend\nJackson's flowing opportunities, and made me an impartial critic of his\nwork.\n\nHe looked at me uneasily, when I brought him to this point; and all his\nexperience in \"carrying over,\" and contingoes, and settling days, and\nwhatever else they call it, was of very little use to him with such a\nticklish stock.\n\n\"Come in here, George,\" he said; \"how am I to talk, as if it were a\nquestion of exchange and discount, when I see her bright hair dancing in\nthe sun like that? But let me look. Don't say a word, until she goes\naway.\"\n\n\"Here are two cart-saddles and a pair of blinkers, and a truss of clover\nhay. If her young spring-carrots can dance through all that, they must\nbeat Berenice's and Helen's of Troy. Don't be quite a fool, Jack. You\nought to know that girls can't abide being stared at with their slops\non. They have got a finer word for it--peg something, in the novels.\nBut Grace never gets herself up for a rustic surprise, like those\nfashionable dairymaids.\"\n\n\"I should hope not indeed! She is nature itself. And all nature is\nsweetest in the morning. But there is not a spark of poetry about you,\nGeorge. All that has gone into the female line. What would I give, to\nsee you frightfully in love!\"\n\nThe piercing glance he gave me completely turned the tables; but I\npulled him back so briskly that he came home to himself; for he was got\nup very bucklish in some Volunteer apparel, on his way to a swell\nrifle-meeting; and it may be imagined that he longed for Grace to look\nat him, almost as much as he longed to look at Grace. However, that was\nno concern of mine. He returned very modestly to his own affairs, and\nsat down where he could not see the window.\n\n\"Has she said anything about me lately? Does she seem to have the least\nidea? You know how I have tried to keep myself in the background\naccording to your advice, which was most kindly meant. But meanwhile\nother fellows have been making play. Thank God, we have settled\nMelladew; I was most afraid of him. Coronet, and sonnets, and a head of\ncurly hair. Foremost of her sex although she is--but, no, what am I\ntalking of? Her mind is far too lofty. When I behold her in her graceful\nsimplicity, like an Angel ministering what they get out of the cows--but\nallow me to hang that cart-saddle on the other peg, George.\"\n\nTo my vexation there was Grace again, standing in the doorway, with a\ngreat spoon in her hand--for a type of the greater one not so very far\naway--giving a taste of some white stuff to old Sally, who was stooping\na hunchified back to save spilling. To see the light poise of the\nyouthful figure, and the merry smile while the white froth was tilted\ncarefully into that ancient mouth, little would you think that within so\nshort a period, all this bright life had missed the grave by half an\ninch.\n\n\"Thank God!\" whispered Stoneman. \"How little heed we take of their\ngoodness, George! All men in comparison ought to be killed.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it,\" I answered. \"Perhaps Melladew ought. He couldn't\nhave made more row if he had been kilt, as an Irishman is being always.\nBut perhaps he could not help it; for it is his nature to.\"\n\n\"In any other case I should not have blamed him much, though it is not\naltogether perhaps the style of Englishmen. But one thing we always\nforget--how intensely some people feel what to others is a flea-bite.\nAnd the ankle is a very nasty place after all, though the shot only just\nbroke the skin, Hopmann says. You heard him claim the shot? Well, now he\nputs it upon me! However, he is quite welcome, for the tale might go\nagainst him with his 'bagients.' Ta, ta! I'm off to enquire for my lord,\nand I always let him know where I come from. Won't Hopmann make a fine\nthing out of this! I have lent him a trap and a man, to make the most of\nit. The man drives like a fury and calls out to everybody, 'Can't\nstop--very sorry--let them all know--the poor Hearl, he is in such\nhagony!' Hopmann's new letter-box is full already, and his hat is a\nhoarding of turnpike tickets.\"\n\n\"What a friend you are! What a friend to have!\" I exclaimed, as he\njumped upon his highly polished horse, for Grace had tripped away with a\nlittle turn of neck, which meant, \"Wouldn't you like to come with me?\"\nAnd Stoneman was hoping to get another glimpse from the saddle over the\npalings. Ay, and he did so too, as the light in his eyes made clear to\nme.\n\nA firm friend is likely to be a faithful lover, and a true husband when\nthe gloss is off the love; but whether Grace had any sense of this, or\neven thought at all about him, was more than I could say at present.\nQuick of perception as she was, it seemed almost impossible that she\ncould have failed to observe his attention, or it might be called his\nentire devotion to her. Yet when I tried her with a lot of little\ndodges, such as a brother must have at command, if he wants to keep time\nwith his sisters, she never turned a hair--as the sporting people\nsay--and she looked me out of countenance sometimes, as if I were\ninferior to the female race. Knowing what she was, I was unable to\nsuppose that there could be any depth in her beyond my understanding, so\nI said to myself, \"Let her mind the milk. What can a sweet girl desire\nbeyond that?\"\n\nTo do good, to be kind, to be always cheerful, and to find their\nhappiness in making ours--that was the proper thing, when I was young,\nfor the rising generation of the better sex. Of our faults they must\nhave no knowledge, but be as hard as possible upon their own; and in\nthat particular they had every help from their own sex, whose time was\nripening into criticism. Somehow or other they have changed all that,\nand flung themselves far into the opposite extreme.\n\nNothing could have made me dwell upon such little things, unless there\nhad been one of them that was all the world to me. And while I was\nendeavouring to explain my sister to the clearest of my understanding,\nand blaming her for my failure, there must have been some other purpose\nbehind, which was even more than brotherly. I was able to give very good\nadvice to Jackson Stoneman, and he was quite right in adopting it; but\nthat masterful inaction did not seem to suit my case. What might be\ngoing on even now--that was the great point for me to ascertain--in a\nmatter beyond all discretion or cold comfort? Saturday was come; and I\nhad been attending, with a grandeur of benevolence beyond all praise, to\na love-affair deeply interesting, but in which you might call me a\nspectator only. Surely my own state of puzzle was enough, without trying\nto make dovetails of another pair.\n\nTherefore, as soon as I had paid the men, at three o'clock that\nafternoon, which was the proper time, I saddled Old Joe, and without a\nword to Grace, who might think what she liked--let her mind her own\naffairs--off I set for St. Winifred's valley, where I knew an old shed\nthat would entertain the horse. Let this old fellow get enough to eat,\nwhich he might pull from the hayrick, and all time, all friends, any\nfatherland would be just alike to him.\n\nThe days were drawing in very fast, and although the sun was on the\nshoulder of the hill, the sense of autumn and of night impending had\ntaken the cheer and the warmth away, and saddened the dignity of the\ntrees. My heart was beating fast, yet low, as I hurried down the slope\nfrom the lonely shed: fast with some foolish jerks of hope that any\ncorner might show Dariel; yet low, as every corner went its way, without\nany sign of my darling. When I came to the ruined chapel, and peeped in,\ndiscovering only solitude, so flurried and tremulous was my condition--a\nmost unusual state for me--that the Lesghian chief, if he saw me thus,\nmight fairly think that some mischief from the old wound was at work\ninside. To recover myself and appear before him in a decent manner, I\ncrossed the brook by a fallen tree, and wandered into the gloomy wood,\nwhere the old approach had lost its way; and here I lingered so long\nthat dusk was deepening into darkness when I crossed the lonely stream\nagain.\n\nFearing that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar might suppose me to be careless, and having\nrecovered my self-command in right of much moralising, I entered by the\nlower door, and walked across the grass towards the quarters where the\npeople lived. All was quiet, dull, and foggy, darker than the land\noutside, and damp enough to give love itself a touch of rheumatic fever.\nMost of the men were gone, as their happy fashion was on Saturday, to\nfetch good things of victualling--for no cart came down the valley--and\nother delights, which we are so glad to deny to one another.\n\nAs I passed by a low ruined wall in the fog, I heard a click as of some\niron latch falling to, or flung to carelessly. This drew my attention\nthat way, and then a swish like the swing of a heavy cloak followed, and\nthen I saw a tall man coming from an angle in the wall that had a roof\nto it. At the moment I was walking rather fast, and if I had continued\nat that pace, my elbow and the stranger's might have struck one another;\nfor he was also walking fast, and his course--to use one of Slemmick's\nwords--was \"slantindicular\" to mine. He had not yet descried me, by\nreason of the wall, and feeling that he had no right on these premises,\nI drew back, and let him get in front of me. For I was never at all\ncomfortable about things here, since my interview with Nicolo.\n\nKeeping my distance carefully, I followed that man towards the\nbuildings, while I tried to make out enough of him to learn his rank and\nage, and anything else that could be known. If he were to turn and\nresent my vigilance, gladly would I have it out with him; for a little\nfight, even if I got the worst of it, would have been a comfort to my\nbruised spirit then. But the fellow never turned, and seemed to be quite\nindifferent whether there was any one to heed him. As for his\nappearance, I could make out very little, except that he was not an\nEnglishman. Dark as it was, I could have sworn to that; whether by his\nwalk, or dress, or figure, or what else, I cannot say; but at any rate\nhe was a foreigner; and I could almost answer for it that on his hip was\nswung a sword, which would have made short work of me, had he been so\ndesirous.\n\nInstead of entering the passage of grey flint which led to the\nhouseholds of the colony, the man I was following turned to the right,\nwhere the wall curved in towards the upper door. _Kuban_ and _Orla_, who\ndwelled for the best of their time in this part of the premises, came\nforth and looked at him without a single sniff; and then lowered their\ntails, and crawled away. \"What a villain he must be!\" thought I; \"they\nknow him, but would rather not even speak to him.\"\n\nBut the impression he had made upon them was far beyond this. To my\nsurprise, they condemned the entire human race for the moment, reasoning\n(as we must have taught them to do) from the particular to the\nuniversal. For when I passed and held out my hand, not a word would they\nhave to say to me, which perhaps was the better for my safety. Then as I\nfollowed with my temper rising, and resolved to bring the man to book as\nhe unbarred the door, what did he do but with one great vault gain that\ncoign of reconnaissance where the watch-dog loved to sit, and plunge\nfrom it into the world beyond, with some strange headgear shown between\nthe battlements, and then a clank of hard metal, and a heavy flap of\nivy.\n\nI have often been surprised, as every man must be, who lives to full\ngrowth upon this wondrous earth; but this time my astonishment went\nquite beyond its powers. Every one had always taken me for a great\njumper, but, to save my life, I could never have done that. I stood, and\nlooked up into the darkness of the sky, as if for some witness to\nconfirm my doubtful eyes; and then a deep conviction of the existence of\nthe Devil--which philosophers in mutinous ingratitude deny--came to my\naid, and calmed me with the sense of duty which his name inspires. And\nnow the two dogs, breathing calmly again, and with their tails\nhigh-masted, came to apologise for that trimming which even they had\nlearned towards their dearest friend. Here was something genial; and I\nforgave them, because I might have done the same, if touched with equal\ninsight.\n\n\"I will get to the bottom of this,\" thought I, \"though the scoundrel has\nput the wall between us.\" For I knew not at all how to open that door,\neven if it seemed desirable. With a quick step, therefore, I retraced my\ncourse, while _Kuban_ and _Orla_ came after me, sniffing my track with\nhappy puffs, to be sure of something wholesome. Keeping clear of the\ndwellings, I went back along the wall, to investigate the corner from\nwhich that demon of mystery had emerged. What superstition can there be\nin a Winchester and New College man, who has eaten for the Bar, and\nknows something of Stockbrokers, and as much as is good of Solicitors?\nBut it is better to avoid such subjects now.\n\nBoth dogs lay down at a certain spot, where a narrow track just visible\nacross the grass began; perhaps they were forbidden to come further down\nthat way. But I went on, treading gingerly, until I was stopped by a\npair of wire-doors. It was rather dark still, but not so murky as it had\nbeen, for the moon began to lift herself a little through the mist. As\nher faint light came glimmering over the black wall, I began to see what\nthe little structure was, and how it was sheltered and protected\noverhead. Dariel had told me that she was very fond of birds, and had\nsome beauties of her own; and no doubt this was where she kept them. Now\nif that hateful fellow with the strange headgear came out of this\nenclosure, as appeared too manifest, it was equally plain that he must\nhave been inside it; and what could he be doing in this aviary so late,\nunless the fair owner herself were there?\n\nMy wrath and indignation knew no bounds. If I were being treated in this\nperfidious way, what steps could be too strong or too insidious, if\nthey led to the confusion of the traitors? Though the dogs were as\nsilent as if they were carved in stone, I went back to them and\nthreatened them with quick and painful death, if they dared to enquire\ninto my proceedings. Then by a little reconnoitring I found a corner of\nthe netting which formed the outer fence, from which I could see into\nthe inner room, which had been impossible from the gate. I could have\nopened that gate perhaps, but not without noise enough to attract\nattention; and now I could see as well as if I were inside, for the\nwire-mesh made no difference.\n\nAt the end of the room which was nearest to me, and only a few yards\nfrom the corner I had found, sat Dariel herself, with a purple cloak on,\nor a mantle, or jacket--I never know the proper words, and it makes no\ndifference, except to women. Of the colour, I could not be sure by that\nlight; except that it was deep, and rich, and grand, and her white neck\nshone forth it, like a hyacinth from dark tulips. There were two candles\nburning on a rustic round table, and she, with her forehead gleaming\nsoftly, kept her left hand partly closed, while the other hand went\nround and round as if it were winding something slowly upon some little\nobject which I could not see; for around it fell the shadowy tresses\nwhich had so often baffled me in quest of a sweet glance from her eyes.\nEvery now and then, I caught a glimpse of a very delicate and straight\nnose (the beauty of which has never been surpassed), and once or twice\nthere came into view the perfection of a chin, a soft harmony conducting\nfrom the roses of the lips to the lilies of the neck. All this was very\nlovely, and my heart was wild about it; though my mind was fierce the\nother way, that none was ever to be mine. For whom had she arrayed\nherself in that homicidal beauty?\n\nBut while I was grinding my teeth and wrinkling my forehead into\nwire-work, she softly turned her gentle face, and my rage was gone as\ndarkness flies when the quiet moon arises. There were great tears\nrolling, and wet eyes beaming, and the pity of a world of sadness\nspeaking in the eloquence of a silent mouth. Also with love's\nvaticination I seemed to discover terror there, and the call for some\nstrong form to shield her from troubles and dangers menacing. \"There has\nbeen no flirtation here,\" thought I. \"What a jealous fool I am! In this\nthere must be some dark distress. How could I think so of my Dariel!\"\nAnd when I beheld the next thing she did, my self-reproach grew deeper.\n\nFor she opened the curve of her left palm, slowly and softly in fear of\nrash release, keeping the fingers of the other hand in readiness for\nrepression; and there I saw, with his green fluff panting in a velvet\ncradle, a small bird of bright plumage, with enquiring eyes regarding\nher. He seemed to know her for his best friend, and though taken aback\nby misfortune, to trust this member of the human race to do all that\nmankind could do for him.\n\nMade of hard stuff as I am, I do not feel ashamed to say, that the pity\nwhich is in all of us, drew straws from the candle and made bars along\nthe mist, when I saw what the girl I loved had done. That poor little\nbird had a broken leg, newly broken by violence, and Dariel had been\ngently binding the splintered shank together, with cotton wool and a\nreel of silk, as I could see on the table, and a strip of cane from a\nchair hard by; and now she was shaking one finger at him, to let him\nknow that fluttering is no remedy for affliction.\n\nBut why did she cry so? She ought to be smiling and looking glad, when\nthe little chap's mate flew down so kindly, and perched on the reel of\nsilk to comfort him, and then fluttered round and round him with her\nwings drooped down, and a tenderness of cooing which almost set him on\nhis legs again; for they were a pair of what are called \"lovebirds,\" of\nwhom, if one hops the final twig, the other pines into the darkness and\ndies. So at least the story of the bird-men goes, although that excess\nof fidelity may be beyond the faith of other men.\n\nTell me not that love is blind. It has the swiftest of all sight. It\nflies to its conclusion straighter than the truest lovebird. I saw why\nDariel could not smile at the success of her own skill: the tears on her\ncheeks were not of pity only, but of anger at human brutality. That\nfellow had done it, that miscreant whom even the dogs of his native land\nabhorred--Prince Hafer had broken the pretty lovebird's leg! A rapid\nconclusion of mine, but the right one; as became manifest, before many\ndays had passed.\n\nBlessedness and bitterness at once possessed me. Would she ever accept\nsuch a wicked beast as that? And when should I have the delight of\nbreaking--not his leg, that would not be half enough, but the haughty\nhead that he was carrying so high? I felt the black fury of the Caucasus\nitself rising in a breast of the quiet Surrey stock. Cruelty to anything\nthat lives is loathsome; but cruelty to a little trusting pet, lent us\nby the Father to teach us loving-kindness, and that pet the darling of a\nsweet and gentle maiden! One more look at her--she has put him to his\nroost in a soft warm corner where he can make no pretence to hop, but\nthe partner of his pain can feed him.\n\nBut I must be off, for I dare not intrude upon her quiet sorrow, and\nperhaps I had no right to watch her as I did; but I meant no harm, and\nthe pretty sight has been a lesson of goodwill to me. Now for her noble\nfather's room! I ought to have been there long ago. What will he say to\nme? But whatever it may be, what I say of his beautiful child is\nthis--\"She is more than any angel; she is a tenderhearted woman.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTO CLEAR THE WAY\n\n\nThe manners and customs of that little colony, or settlement, or camp,\nor whatever it should be called--for I never found out the right name\nfor it--differed from ours very widely, some better no doubt, and some\nworse perhaps. For instance, who could blame them for their rational\npractice of leaving hard work to Occidental races? They did a stroke or\ntwo when they could not help it, just to keep their bodies sound; but\nthe chief and commander, as we too expect, had to carry through with his\nown hands the hardest part of everything. But another custom of theirs\nappeared to be of more doubtful wisdom; for instead of having set hours\nfor meals and accomplishing them sociably, as well as with some\nregularity and sense of responsibility, every man was allowed to eat\nwhat he liked, when he liked, and where he liked. The natural result was\nthis--you could never be certain of finding a man with his mouth in\ncondition to answer you. How they got food enough to be at it so\nperpetually, was for a long time a mystery to me, especially as they\ndealt so little with any of the farms or shops around. Not a man of them\nwas ever seen in our village, and as for the very few women in the\ncamp--Baboushka, and Mrs. Stepan, and some who did the washing--not one\nof them came out of her white cocoon, though brought up very largely as\nChristians.\n\nThis statement is in its place, to show why the man, whom I revered, was\nstill in a position to command my reverence. If he had been subject to\nfeminine irruptions, to which even the greatest men are liable, all his\ndevotion to the highest enterprise might have failed to secure his\nequanimity. But he had contracted upon reasonable terms with a vast\nUniversal Provider, and he only had to pay the weekly totals in advance,\nand send to the place of delivery, once or twice a-week, according to\nthe temperature. Thus everybody found himself fed to the utmost of his\nnature, and most of them preferred canned victuals; though something\nmore British had been required for our Police.\n\nThat evening, when I entered S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's room, after leaving his daughter\namong her birds, the first thing I did was to watch him very keenly for\nany sign of anxiety or excitement, such as he might be expected to show\nif he had been just visited by that abominable Prince Hafer. What right\nhad I to identify the man I had seen with the one of whom I had only\nheard? And even if that conclusion should prove right, by what process\ncould I tell that there was nothing good about him? Yet in my mind there\nwas no shadow of a doubt about either of those points, and I looked at\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar as if he must acquit himself of some contagion before I could\nenjoy his society. But he met me quite as usual, without even\ncomplaining of my unpunctuality; for he was a man of such dignity that\nhe suspected nobody of slighting him.\n\nWhatever he might be doing, or of whatever he might be speaking, there\nwas such simplicity, and largeness, and straightforwardness pervading\nit, that one seemed to fall into it and follow, instead of doubting, and\nquerying, and perpending. And his gentle and friendly and kind steady\ngaze brought all that was good in one to meet him, and drove away the\ndirty streaks of our nature, to hide themselves under their own mud.\n\n\"I have been considering, my dear young friend,\" he said, as he took and\nheld my hand, and I felt ashamed to leave it in so warm a place, after\nall my cold suspicions, \"about my behaviour to you the other day.\nNothing unkind was intended, but unkindness is often done without that.\nYou told me that you loved my dear, and now my only child. I should have\nreceived that with more goodwill, whether it suited my own views or not.\nFor my manner then, I beg your pardon.\"\n\nI answered that nothing in his manner then, or at any time since I had\nknown him, could be taken by any gentleman as uncourteous or\ninconsiderate. I had told him what was the main object of my life, and I\nfelt that I was right in doing so; and although I could scarcely hope\nfor his approval, being a poor man and of no high rank, I had done what\nseemed to me to be the proper thing, instead of coming as his guest upon\nfalse pretences. I spoke plainly, and he answered nobly.\n\n\"Of rank I have not so much regard, as of the man who bears it. Neither\ndo I think that wealth confers any high condition on its owner. In too\nmany cases it lowers him. You will believe me when I say that neither of\nthose questions causes my regret at what you told me. I live for only\ntwo things now--the happiness of my darling child, and the improvement\nof the noble race to which I happen to belong. I have also bitter\nwrongs, and the happiness of my life snatched from me. The love of\nrevenge is in Eastern blood, and a very hard force it is to overcome.\nYou of English race cannot enter into that, because it is not born in\nyou. But I know what the indignation is, when the sense of justice\nrises.\"\n\nHis quiet eyes flashed as if his heart was roused by the words it had\ngiven way to. And glad was I, not to be the man presented by it in the\nportraiture of memory.\n\n\"Why do I admire the British race?\" he continued, with his better tone\nrecovered; \"not for their energy and manliness alone, not even for their\nlove of freedom, and great spirit of truth and justice, but most of all\nbecause they alone of all the nations I have mingled with are born\nwithout this cursed taint of savage and vile vindictiveness. If a man\nwrongs you, you have it out with him. You thrash him, if nature has\nenabled you. You vent your wrath upon him, and you go your way. The\nworld is large enough for both of you. If you hear of his misery, and\nwoe, and death, you only say, 'Poor fellow, there may have been more\ngood in him than I thought.' But with us of the Eastern and the Southern\nblood, that blood is turned to poison by a deep and bitter wrong. By the\ngrace of God, and the grandeur of our Christ, I have struggled long\nagainst this birth of Satan in me; but even now I have not overcome it,\nutterly and for ever, as a larger mind would crush it. But what has this\nto do with you? A great deal, if you have really set your heart upon my\ndaughter. Are you sure that you have done that with true English\nstrength and thoroughness? No passing whim, no delight of the eyes, as a\nflower or a picture catches them; but a power that will last as long as\nyou do, and longer than the earthly part of you?\"\n\nNo fellow likes to be cross-examined thus; and to tell the plain truth,\nI had scarcely gone into myself in this awful manner. But I soon\nperceived that he was speaking rather at the prompting of his own\nremembrance, than of set form and purpose for probing me. So as the\npicture arose before me of Dariel and her little bird, I spared no word\nthat I could think of; though none were half strong enough, none half\nstaunch enough; nothing that came to my lips had any right to go out as\nif it spoke for me. Truly I had not been so touched by the piety,\nmystery, exalted beauty, and lovely maidenhood of my love, as I was by\nthe sight of her tender self indulging her loving nature.\n\n\"I am satisfied about that, my friend,\" her father said, when I began to\nbe ashamed, as we ought to be, of all our higher feelings; \"and I know\nenough of you to be sure that you have a strong and steadfast mind. I\nhave not spoken of your friends, because you have never invited me to do\nso. That obstacle, if there is one, is your consideration, more than\nmine. But the obstacles on our part are of a very different nature. Of\nEnglish ladies I know not much, though I had the honour of being\nintroduced to some of what you call the high society, when I came first\nto this island; and they seemed to me to be endowed with virtues well\nadapted to their beauty. But they have to contend with this great\ndanger--they are allowed to choose their own partners in life, whenever\nthe money is abundant, before they have attained good intelligence. With\nour daughters this is not the case. The parents make a wise selection\nfor them, sometimes even dispensing with much revenue, when there are\ngreat qualities to compensate.\"\n\n\"We never go quite so far as that,\" I said, \"unless the lady behaves in\nsuch a way that it is impossible for us to help it.\"\n\n\"But I have been surprised to find,\" he continued, with a smile which\nleft me doubtful whether it were of paternal pride, or of that quiet\nhumour which he sometimes showed, \"that my daughter seems to take most\nkindly to the modes of thought and the greater independence which the\nladies of this country have permitted to themselves. It may be in the\nair, or it may be in the nature; but I am often quite astonished at the\nsayings and doings of my Dariel. She has been brought up by a lady who\nis partly of English birth, and for a month or two with English\nchildren; but still her unusual style of judging for herself is amazing\nand terrifying to our elder women, who being of a different rank--and\nthat reminds me, if my daughter has a fault, and I suppose she must\nhave, it is, Mr. Cranleigh, the pride of birth. Not an ignoble fault,\nbut still a very serious one, especially as it can never be expelled.\n\n\"Through her mother she is of higher birth than I am, though not of more\nancient lineage perhaps, as I happen to be one of the Kheusurs. But all\nthese things you cannot understand, even if you wish to do so, without a\nknowledge of my long sad tale, which I have not told as yet to any\nperson living. Even my daughter has not heard it, and I hope she never\nmay; for it would serve perhaps to do mischief to her young mind with\nanxiety. The Lord governs all things on earth; all of our race begin to\nfeel that, when their little strength is stripped from them. But you are\ntoo young to see things so; and never has the tale of one man's life had\nany effect upon another's, unless it were to lead him into wild\nadventures, easy to talk about, hard to go through. Be content without\nthem.\"\n\nI looked at him with some hesitation. Would it be kind of me, even if I\nhad the right, to put him through all these griefs again, which had\nchanged him from a bold young Chief, primed with excitement, and peril,\nand love, into a quiet exile, and a Christian moraliser, a founder of\ntype with hard blue hands, and oh, saddest fate of all, an experimental\nPublisher? No, it would be a cruel thing, a selfish call upon sad\nmemory, a mere abuse of large goodwill, and a vile advantage taken of an\nover-tender conscience. With these finer feelings, I almost said, \"I\nentreat you, sir, not to tell me;\" when the Spirit that hates the human\nrace whispered to me that there has never been a man, and probably never\nwill be one, who cannot find pleasure in talking of himself, however\ndark the subject. And why should I doubt that it would do him good, as\nsoon as he got into full swing?\n\n\"The last thing I could desire, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, would be to renew your\ntroubles.\" There was no humbug in these words of mine, as there was with\nthe pious \u00c3\u0086neas; for as the Lesghian Chief sat down and leaned his head\nupon his hands, he reminded me of my father's look, when his money came\nto nothing; moreover, I saw in his face a large resemblance to his\ndaughter's in her sorrow over that pet bird. \"It would be a terrible\ntrial to you. But until I know more, I am all in the dark. Perhaps you\nwill think it over, and whatever you do will be certain to be right.\"\nFor the more he reminded me of my sweet one, the less could I bear to\nworry him.\n\n\"This is very good of you,\" he said most kindly, \"and it doubles my duty\ntowards you. I am ashamed of this weak and foolish feeling. You have a\nright to know all my history, and you shall, if you will come to-morrow.\nIt is too late now for me to begin to-night, and I have a little duty to\ndischarge. On a Saturday night we always thank the Lord for His care of\nus throughout the week. You belong probably to the Church of England. We\nof the Kheusur tribe have our very simple forms, handed down through\nages, from the same source as yours perhaps. We have our little service\nat noon on Sundays. Would you like to be with us to-morrow?\"\n\nNothing could have been more to my liking; and as it happened, there was\nno fear of disturbing our home arrangements, for my father was laid up\nwith a slight attack of gout, and my mother in close attendance upon\nhim. So in a few words it was settled that after attending their\nservice, of whatever kind it might be, I should be allowed to hear the\nhistory of the Lesghian Chief, which was much more than the first\npromise I received. Knowing that now I should have full light thrown\nupon all the strange things which had so long engaged my attention and\ncuriosity, and what was infinitely more than that, upon everything\nconnected with Dariel, I rode home that night in a glow of excitement,\ntempered at intervals with nervous dread. For I might hear things that\nwould place a bar forever, or a gulf, betwixt me and my love.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nNOT FOR SALE\n\n\nBut when I had fed my good horse that evening, and bedded him\ncomfortably as he deserved, returning with a hock of cold bacon to my\nden, and a jug of ale which I needed sorely, there I found my white deal\ntable, just where I was going to lay the cloth, covered with a canopy\nand tissue-fringing of gold too bright for the candle-light.\n\n\"Who has brought this beehive here and stuck it on my table?\" I asked\nwith a tone of wonder and vexation; for I had quite enough to do with my\nown affairs just now.\n\n\"Did you ever see a beehive of this colour? Then I should like to know\nwhere they got the straw from?\"\n\nGrace had lifted her head, and was passing both hands through the curls\nof which she was so proud that she cared not what we called them, and\nher cheeks had a rich, unusual flush; and there was some new brightness\nin her eyes as well, bright enough always, now too bright, with\nunsettled weather in the depth beyond the blue. I saw that there was\nsomething up, but left her to begin it.\n\n\"George, have you taken it into your head, not to care a straw for your\nsister any more?\" This was exactly what I expected; but I looked at her\nwith innocent astonishment. I put down my bacon and my jug of beer, but\ndrew back the cloth, to leave room for her arms, and then gazed at her\nwith some dignity.\n\n\"Oh, you need not be afraid. I am not going to cry over it,\" she\nexclaimed, with the usual ingratitude of girls; \"in fact I feel much\nmore inclined to laugh. You have been trying to sell me, to sell your\nown sister! Can you not imagine, George, that I am not for sale?\"\n\n\"Look here!\" I said, for this was coming it too strong; \"you have got\ninto some tantrums, some feminine delusions. I have not had a bit to\neat, I don't know when; and I must recruit the inner man, while you come\nto your senses.\"\n\n\"Poor thing! It cannot be so very deep in love, or it would be satisfied\nto live on air. But don't they feed you where you go, dear George? Well,\nthat does seem inhospitable. And they must be rich people, or you would\nnot go so often.\"\n\nThis was almost more than I could stand. However, I kept up my dignity,\nremembering that the more impudent a girl is, the more she \"climbs down\"\nafterwards. \"Your very good health, my dear child!\" I said, and then\nobserved her through the glass which formed the bottom of the tankard.\nNow I say that she was a very sweet young woman, and a worthy wife for\nthe best man that ever lived, not to lose all self-command at this; for\nthe loveliest creature ever born cannot flatter herself that she looks\nwell thus.\n\n\"You want to make me cry, but you won't do it. And once for all, just\nunderstand this little point. I don't care a rap--as you elegantly\nexpress it--what airs you put on to exasperate me. Because I am certain\nthat you understand me, George. All the very small things you say--and\nyou have a low gift of walking under your own feet--all of them--what I\nmean is, none of them have the smallest effect upon my poor mind. In the\nfirst place, I am not clever, any more than you are. And if I were, I\nshould only use it to make you more and more fond of me, instead of\nendeavouring to make you feel small. But, oh, George, I never thought\nthat you would scheme to sell me!\"\n\n\"All this is Abracadabra to me,\" I replied quickly, in fear of a\ntorrent. For when a girl tells you that she won't cry, you may almost\nalways see her fingers getting ready for her handkerchief.\n\n\"How innocent you look! But just one little question. Did you not send\nMr. Stoneman Jackson to propose to me, this very evening?\"\n\n\"Nothing of the sort. And as if you did not know his name! I have not\neven seen him, since that day when you were cutting such a shine in the\nsun, as the frugal, virtuous, and lovely milkmaid. That is what has\nfetched him; not your stupid brother.\" I owed her a cut or two, as\neverybody will perceive.\n\n\"George, you are cruel, even more than crafty. As if I did anything so\nlow as that! But will you assure me, upon your honour, that you did not\nencourage him to--to try what he has been trying?\"\n\n\"Not only that, but I did all I could to damp him off, so far as such a\ndry fellow could be damped. I told him to hold off, while the Earl was\nin the running.\"\n\n\"There was no Earl in the running. This is too bad of you. It was only\nthe walking that Lord Melladew went in for, and I am sure he meant no\nharm by that.\"\n\n\"Well, he made the running fast enough, when they peppered his gaiters,\nand some one else did the tumbling. But I told Jackson to hold off, for\nI was sure that he had no chance yet. He is a decent sort of fellow\nenough in his way; but what chance could he have against a belted Earl,\nand a gaitered Earl too, who can shriek in sonnets? Poor Stoneman could\nscarcely put thumb to rhyme with mum; and mum he should have been,\nthough it is rather hard upon him. Never mind, he can find some other\ngirl, when he gets over it. I heard of a Duke's daughter who was wild to\ncatch him. But he is much too hard hit, to think of any one for years.\"\n\n\"One of Mr. Erricker's tales, I daresay,\" said Grace, with a little sigh\nof sympathy, as I fetched a sham groan for my poor friend, \"about that\nbeautiful Duke's daughter. As if any girl with any self-respect would\nallow herself to be talked of in that way! And as if Mr. Stoneman would\npermit it for a moment! However, you seem to have thoroughly discussed\nmy case. Did you settle what my pin-money was to be? Oh, George, George,\nwill you never understand how very different we are from you? I did\nthink I could have respected Mr. Stoneman; but when I find out that he\nhas been to you, trying to buy me like a colliery share, or not even\nthat, for it is all divorce now--to take me on lease like a cottage or a\nstable,--oh, I see why you took me for a beehive now; but you'll find\nless of honey than of sting in me, when you buy and sell me by the pound\nlike this.\"\n\nWhat a fool that stockbroker must have been to mention my name in the\nmatter, for it was sure to set her off upon this sort of tack! However,\nit proved afterwards that she, being perfectly calm, while he was in a\nfrightful flurry, had extracted from him with the greatest ease\neverything she cared to know, till she came with the usual leaps and\nbounds of feminine reason to the wrong conclusion--that I had suggested\nand worked up the whole affair.\n\n\"Now go to bed, my dear child,\" I said, perceiving how vain it was to\nargue now; \"I have business to see to, and even you can scarcely expect\nme to be swallowed up in your affairs, when you make a point of\ndisliking this man, because your own brother likes him.\"\n\nThat little turn was almost worthy of her own ingenuity. She looked at\nme with a twinkle, because it was so like what she herself in my\nposition would have said, and then after wishing me good-night, she\nadded--\n\n\"But I never said a word about disliking him. There has scarcely been\ntime enough for that as yet. Women very seldom form those sudden\nprejudices. That they leave for the lords of creation.\"\n\nAs she vanished with this very poor miss-fire, I began to put two and\ntwo together, and arrived at the conclusion that the stockbroker's case\nwas not altogether hopeless. She had not come to care about him yet\nperhaps; but now he would be in her thoughts more often; and if he kept\nhis distance, and looked downcast, and did a lot of good among the poor\nwith strict orders to have it kept secret, and caused general uneasiness\nabout his health; above all, if he could only be bankrupt,--without\nlosing his cash, which of course would never do,--I could not see why he\nshould not have a Mrs. Stoneman, who belonged to an old Saxon family,\nand had gold enough in her heart and head to do without any in her\nmaiden pocket, and who was blest with a brother of the name of George.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nVOICES OF THE VALLEY\n\n\nIn the calm air of the Sunday morning with the brook going gently by, I\ncame to the entrance of the hoary ruins wherein I had first seen Dariel.\nA chapel with lines of grey flint only, to show where once the sacred\nwalls had risen, and nothing but the soft sky for roof, and mortar and\nmoss for pavement. Stepan, as big as a pulpit, but more mute, stood\nclose by expecting me, and led me along a ferny path, and dusted a stone\nto sit upon, with a noble quietude. But when I asked him--\"What am I to\ndo?\" he took it for our national salutation, and answered \"like a house\nafire, sir.\" So I gave it up, and resolved to act according to the light\nof nature, and the behaviour of the others when they arrived. Only if\nthere came a great procession of images, as I expected, nothing should\nmake me depart from the proper demeanour of a Briton.\n\nHowever I was not called upon to assert the great Reformation. A more\nsimple, quiet, and impressive service I never witnessed anywhere; and\nalthough there was no roof overhead, and little enclosure on either\nside, the view of the sky, and the passing of the wind, and the sense of\nantiquity around us were in harmony, as it seemed to me, with the\nconditions of humility, and mortality, and hopefulness. The strictest\nPuritan could have found fault with little except the red crosses worn\nby all the congregation, and a few triangles and wreaths of white\nflowers. And the man who can find any fault with these must consider\nhimself too faultless to worship any other being.\n\nFirst came the women, only seven or eight in number, veiled not very\nheavily, and cloaked in cheerful raiment. And the last of these was\nDariel, looking as if she had never dreamed of anything uncelestial,\nwhile the loveliness of her figure gleamed through the folds of her\nflowing mantle; even as the flexure and the texture of an agate glisten\nthrough the cloudy pretext of their coat to hide them. \"Who shall\nunderstand these things?\" thought I, \"there is no one on earth fit to\napproach her; yet the Lord cannot have meant her to be always by\nherself.\" And then I thought of Hafer--Prince indeed! Prince of\ndarkness, and nothing else--and I looked about, with anything but\nreligious peace inside me. However I could perceive no sign of any\nwickedness high or low; and every heart except my own sang a grateful\nand worshipful tune to the Lord.\n\nEven to me it was a quiet and devout proceeding, when Imar (not as one\nwho preaches to a crowd of animals below him, but like a man speaking to\nand on behalf of men--not abject, though beneath a cloud) began the\nsimple offering of our love, and trust, and loyalty. To me it was\ngrander than it might have been to those who could criticise it; for I\ncould not object to anything, because I did not comprehend a word.\nNevertheless it did me good, inasmuch as it did the others good; and if\na man lives in himself alone, he will not find much good there, I fear.\nAnd when they began their final hymn of high thanksgiving, and hopeful\ntrust that our Maker will not be as hard upon us as we are upon one\nanother, the sound of great rejoicing--which our Christians never\nindulge in--filled the valley, and went up the heights, such as we are\nbidden to gaze at, while we stick to the dismal hollows. I knew that I\nwas only of a dull prosaic order, but felt for the moment above myself,\nwith the other fellows lifting me.\n\nHowever absurd it may appear to those who are always at one level of\nself-made dignity and--something else--true it is we all were moved, as\nno formality can stir us. Stepan had a mighty voice, and more than his\nthroat was in it; then Dariel cast by her veil, and her beautiful lips\nwere trembling, like a wild-rose quivering with petals half-open over\nsome melodious stream. I thought of the time when I had first beheld\nher, and my love was not of this earth alone.\n\nWhen all were gone, and I was thinking still what prigs we are, and\ncowards too, who suppose that there is one way only of getting near our\nFather, that humble man who had been our priest came up to me, and spoke\nsadly. I saw that he was down at heart, and full of doubt about himself,\nand wanting higher comfort than a man like me could give him. But I\ncould not guess, until he told his melancholy story, why he should be\nthus downcast, after doing his utmost for the benefit of others. I had\nnot known what the service meant, but saw that it had been simple,\nsolemn, and free from all rant and false excitement; and this I ventured\nto express.\n\n\"Come in, my friend, and have some refreshment. On Sundays all the men\ndine together,\" he said as he led me inside the door, \"and we will have\nsomething with them. I fear that you found it difficult to keep from\nlaughing at the sight of such an astonishing set of hats, and scarcely\nany two alike. We copied them first, I sometimes think, from our highest\nand most fantastic peaks; but art has outdone nature. In truth they are\na motley lot, but there is not a false heart among them.\"\n\nI had seen nearly all of them before, on the day of the police invasion,\nbut not as now in their best apparel, a strange and interesting sight.\nSome of them had wondrous coats, frogged and braided, and painted and\npatched, and ribboned and laced, and leathered, and I know not what,\nwith coins, and baubles, and charms, and stars, and every kind of\ndangle; and two of them wore Russian uniforms far advanced in years, and\ncaptured perhaps in the days of Shamyl. But their faces, though covered\nwith beards and freckles, could not be called savage or ignoble; and\nthough one or two bore a swarthy aspect, some were as fair as\nEnglishmen. I could well believe that there might be truth in the\ntradition of their tribe, that they were a separate race, distinct among\nthe myriad mountain strains, having the hot oriental blood refreshed and\nstrengthened from the Western founts. They regarded their Chief with\npatriarchal loyalty and deference, but no servility or cringing; it was\nhis pleasant duty to maintain them, and theirs to work for him, to a\nrational extent. Whatever they had was his, so far as nature allows\nsuch partnership; while his property enjoyed the privilege of\nministering to their welfare.\n\n\"They have done well,\" said the Chief to me, while I was revolving these\nthings slowly; and hoping that his daughter might appear at last to\ngrace the feast; \"they will go and wander in their gardens now, and have\nthe pleasure of sitting in their native form.\"\n\n\"Which is something like that of a hare,\" I replied, without calling to\nmind that it might seem rude; but he smiled, for he never took offence\nunless it were intended, which is a most sagacious rule. And he\nproceeded with his inference.\n\n\"The fact that they are coming without much pain to the use of chairs\nand benches, when commended to them by a good dinner, tends to prove\nthat they are of a high and naturally docile race. But come to my room,\nand have a glass of Kahiti; and then we will go forth into the wood, and\nyou shall know all that has come to pass in the life of a man not so\nvery old yet, but with all his best years behind him.\"\n\nHe smiled, and I looked at him still in his strength, still comely and\nsweet of temper, a man with almost every gift of nature, but not endowed\nwith happiness. And his smile was not that of a jubilant heart, which\nhas tried and can trust its own buoyancy; but rather of the calm mind\nwhich flows in, to level all the tumult, and to cover all the ruin. I\nthought to myself that I must come to that, if Dariel went on, as she\nseemed to do, and kept out of sight without a word to me.\n\nBut after a bottle of the Chief's light wine--a dozen of which would not\nhave turned a British hair--I had the presence of mind to fill my pipe\nand pouch with some very fair tobacco of the mountains, and to follow\nhim over a clever little bridge of his own construction into the heart\nof the grey old wood. There we sat upon a mossy log, and he poured out\nhis story, while the sunshine came in slants sometimes, and I wished\nthere had been more of it.\n\nI cannot repeat S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's tale with any of his self-commanding\nstrength, much less convey the light and shade of a voice alive with\nmemory of whatever the soul has suffered. However, to the best of my\nbelief, the import of his words is here. Feebly, but never falsely,\nhave I set down his remembrances. Only his foreign turns of language\nhave escaped my memory; and he must tell what he has to tell like an\nordinary Englishman. Which means without long words, whenever short ones\nserve the turn as well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nIMAR'S TALE--WAR\n\n\n\"That which I have always admired in your nation, and that which has\nmade you what you are, under the guidance of the Lord, is your natural\ngift of self-command. The race to which I belong has always been very\nscant of that great quality; and this fault has been from age to age the\ncause of misery and conflict. Not that we are by any means so turbulent\nand vindictive as other tribes around us; for we almost alone are\nguided, when in our proper state of mind, by any sense of Christianity;\nmost of the others who call themselves of that creed, such as the\nOssets, Imeritians, and barbarous Suans, have made a strange jumble of\nthe true faith with Mohammedanism, paganism, and even stark idolatry.\nBut the Lesghians, with whom we have most to do, and who claim us as of\ntheir affinity, still are of Islam, and mainly of that bigoted and\naggressive form of it which is known as Muridism. Even so, they are\nnobler, braver, more patriotic, and loyal to their chiefs, as well as of\nfiner presence, and greater activity and industry than most of their\nneighbours on the west and south, who suppose themselves to be\nChristians.\n\n\"My father, S\u00c3\u00bbr Dadian, as hereditary Chief of the Kheusurs--a tribe now\ndwindled from its former strength--commanded for many years their\ndivision in the army of the gallant Shamyl. Our people did not share of\ncourse that fury of Islam, and blaze of the crescent, which scorched the\nRussians by the thousand out of the dark ravines of Daghestan.\nNevertheless we stood up for ourselves, with the muzzle of a gun at\nevery elbow of the rocks; and if all the sons of Islam had been as\nfaithful to their great Imaum, as the Cross was, the Russian flag would\nnever have waved over Guinib, in Shamyl's lifetime.\n\n\"The Russian plan was to press us hard, throughout the summer and\nautumnal months, with ten men perhaps to every one of ours; to encourage\nus most benevolently to sow our land and tend it, and then to rejoice\nand renew their strength with the pithy marrow of our corn, and the\njuicy fibre of our flocks and herds. A man loves his country on the very\nsame principle on which he loves his mother; but if he can never taste\nwhat she is like, he might just as well have a step-mother. Neither was\nthis the only loss of satisfaction year by year. Our men, as I have\nheard them tell, when I was old enough to join them, felt even worse\nthan their own privations the rich gain of the enemy. To sit on a rock,\njust out of shot--as many a dauntless Avar told me--with glacier water\nfor his drink, and nothing but mast on his tattered lap, and to see a\nhundred fat round fellows, who had come into his land quite lean,\nlaughing and joking at his own door, with the milk of his best cow at\ntheir lips, and the kids of his flock coming up to them in sniffs from\nthe fires where they were roasting, this he assured me--and I could\nquite believe him--turned his empty digestion into bile, and the love of\nhis native land into a hollow ache. And this very feeling, in a higher\nform, cost my dear father his valiant life, and left me and my sister\norphans.\n\n\"You may have heard of the defeat and slaughter of an entire Russian\ncolumn, under the great Prince Dorougoff, which our gallant mountain\nforces, with my father second in command, accomplished most effectually.\nEverybody knows what glory and renown accrued to the stout Imaum through\nthis; but all of our men who were present declared that my father\ndeserved the main credit. The Emperor of Russia had grown impatient, and\nsent impetuous orders that his army should advance at once into the\nheart of the defiles, and crush the rebellion--as he dared to call it,\nthough we never had been his subjects--at one mighty blow, and for ever.\nThe Commander replied that he would march His Majesty's army in, but\nnever would march it out again. And according to that answer, so it\nwas. Our men became tired of slaughter, although they had many a long\nyear of suffering to avenge.\n\n\"As might have been expected, the mountaineers grew careless after this\ngreat victory, and left many of their passes open; for the stubborn foe\nhad recoiled, and appeared unable to do anything more until the\nfollowing season. My father went home to see to his affairs, and to\nsecure a new supply of rifles, for he had brought from Koorbashi a score\nof those skilled workmen of Genoese descent, who for accuracy and finish\ncan hold their own with the best gunmakers in the world. All Shamyl's\nbest troops were armed with weapons procured from these admirable\nartisans, and the clumsy muskets of the Russian force were quite unfit\nto cope with them. Stepan has one of those Koorbashi rifles, which you\nwould find it hard to match in London, either for beauty of design or\nfor excellence in shooting. But alas they were all muzzle-loaders, or\nthe Caucasus might have been Caucasian still.\n\n\"Karthlos Tower, where our family had dwelled for many generations,\ntakes its name from that same descendant of Noah who founded Mischel;\nand standing on a mountain plateau, with chasms abrupt and vertical\ncleaving the land to immeasurable depths, it is safe against all adverse\npowers, except treachery and famine. Among the labyrinth of ravines no\nstranger could ever find his road; and if chance at last brought him to\nthe winding access, discretion would hurry him shuddering away. For many\na black muzzle would look down upon him, and if he escaped all those, a\nscore of yellow ones would confront him at the final crest, and of\ntenfold size,--brass artillery from Koorbashi.\n\n\"It was growing dark in those cloven depths, though the sun was still\nhovering upon the upper world, when my father rode round the last sharp\njag at the foot of the ascent to Karthlos. The survivors of his\nwar-dwindled force were only a few yards behind him, lounging on their\ntired horses, and scarcely caring to keep up the burden of their\nhomeward song. Then when their leader was round the point, they heard\nthe roar of a heavy gun, swinging like a wing-flap from wall to wall,\nand departing in the distance, like an echo climbing stairs. They\nspurred to know what it could mean, and they found S\u00c3\u00bbr Dadian dead on\nthe neck of his horse.\n\n\"I had not seen my father more than half a dozen times, so far as\nchildish memory goes; but he was always kind and loving, and very gentle\nwith us. We had lost our mother before we knew her; and Marva and\nmyself, twin children, had been sent from home, we could not tell when,\nto be educated at Tiflis. There our father had some old friends, and\nbeing so seldom at home, by reason of this perpetual war, he had done\nthe best he could for us. I was placed in the German town on the left\nbank of the Kur, and under the care of a learned man, famous even in the\n\"City of many tongues\" for his knowledge of all useful languages. He had\nseveral English pupils, and admiring Shakespeare as the Germans do, he\nmade us almost as familiar with English as if we were born to it. But\nMarva, my sister, had her education in the school of a French convent on\nthe other side of the river. Twins as we were, and pining long at this\nunnatural severance, the force of events, and the power of education,\ndrove us further and further apart, until the early divergencies of\ntastes and dispositions became so hardened and widened that our mutual\nlove was vanishing.\n\n\"The murder of my father--for it could be nothing else--occurred in the\nautumn of 1852; but it was not known in Tiflis until three months later,\nfor the city had long been in Russian hands, and Shamyl's victorious\ntroops allowed very little communication. Even when known, it was kept\nfrom me, for some time longer, as I have reason to believe, by order of\nthe College authorities. At last I knew it by a letter from Shamyl\nhimself, or written by his orders--for he dispensed very largely with\nliterature--which it took me a long time to make out, for I had almost\nforgotten the Avar tongue. How he smuggled it to me, I know not; but at\nlast I understood it to this effect.\n\n\"'Young Imar, the son of Dadian. The Russians have slain thy father in\ncold blood. Thou art now the Chief of the Kheusurs. Thou art not of\nIslam; but if thou hast any blood in thy body, come without delay, and\nhave thy just revenge upon the accursed heathen. Shamyl, the Imaum.'\n\n\"What youth of spirit and health and strength could hesitate for an\nhour? I had many Russian friends at Tiflis, and all of the higher rank\nmade light of the barbarian tumult, as they called it, among the distant\nmountains. They begged me at least to wait until the truth of the\nMuridist outlaw's words could be properly established; for they said\nthat he could outlie a Greek, or even an Armenian. But I broke from them\nall, bade farewell to Marva, and in shorter time than space required,\npresented myself to Shamyl.\n\n\"That Hannibal of the East was now at the acme of his fame and power.\nThough not of great stature, or winning aspect, or even exemplary\ncleanliness, he possessed and exercised that gift of forcing the wills\nof others into the channel of his own, which makes a man's course\nhistorical. He had piercing eyes, deeply set and overhung, and a swarthy\ncomplexion, and strong harsh features, enlivened sometimes with a smile\nconveying a boyish and rudimental sense of humour. But let any one rouse\nhis temper, and the Demon of the Mountains, who haunts the crags of\nKazbek, could not rave more furiously. It was this, and not cold\ninhumanity--as strangers to our race imagined--which drove him into\nthose brutal acts which disgraced the name of Avar. Whether he believed\nin his Divine Mission to restore the glory of Islam, and extirpate the\ninfidel, or whether he laughed in his sleeve at that most useful\ndelusion, I never could decide. As a Christian, and a well educated\nyouth, I thoroughly disdained such stuff; but while contemning the\nMuridist and the Imaum, I fell more than behoved me perhaps under the\ninfluence of the patriot. For I was but eighteen years of age, and as\nyet quite a child among men of action, though foremost of the students\nin philology at Tiflis, and even in bodily strength and activity equal\nto the best of them.\n\n\"My presence at first was of service to the cause, only as securing the\nassistance of my tribe, who had no share in Islam, and would have\ndeserted very promptly without my presence among them. But before long I\nproved myself a valuable recruit, and was advanced to a command among\nthe scouts; upon whom in that war of surprises and sudden encounters\nmuch depended. Although I hated and scorned the religion of our Chief,\nI shared his patriotism, and admired his valour and genius, while often\nwondering at the forbearance he showed to an 'unbeliever.' This I owed\nto his sense of honour, as I learned long afterwards, inasmuch as he had\npromised my father, his old companion in arms, that he would never make\nany attempt to convert me, if I were allowed to join him. Then suddenly\nhe fell in my esteem, for I found out that he had lied to me.\n\n\"So zealous had I been in military matters, and so eager to qualify\nmyself for command, that for two years I never went home to Karthlos\nTower, the proper abode of our race. I never cared for form and fuss,\nand the earthly division of God's children into two creations--the\nhigh-born and the low-born half--for perhaps there are more who knew\ntheir Father in humility, than in proud estate.\n\n\"In my youth I never thought of such things, to which convention drives\nus, but simply divided the men around me into hearties who would fight,\nand poltroons who ran away; and of the latter there were but few. The\nSteward at the Tower had supplied me with all that I wanted in those\nrugged times; and in the hot vein of my patriotism, a crust and an\nicicle seemed enough for a soldier to subsist upon. But now I was\ncompelled to return to Karthlos by a strange thing which had come to\npass, while I was intent upon war alone.\n\n\"Marva, twin-sister of mine, and in childhood dearer than my little self\nto me, had defied all authority; and when that did not avail, had\noutwitted it, and vanished from the Convent-school at Tiflis. And my\nfirst news of it was a strong demand for her portion of the patrimony,\nfrom the man who had run away with her. This was the Chief of an Osset\ntribe, who had never joined in the war, but waited for the final issue;\nin which even we who kept it up could have little confidence, unless the\ngreat Powers in the West, now at enmity with Russia, would send us\nspeedy and effectual help. And I knew that this Osset Chief had been a\nhereditary foe to my father.\n\n\"His name was Rakhan, which is, I believe, of Tartar origin; and he\nshowed signs in character and in features too of kinship to that\nwidespread race. But his father had been of pure Ossetian blood, and now\nhe was acknowledged Chief of a certain wild, and semi-Christian tribe.\nWe had never had much to do with them, although their villages lay near\nus on the West; for the Russians kept a fortified post between us, where\ntheir main road crosses the mountain-chain, and we scarcely regarded\nthem as brother Christians, though that did not prevent us from having\nplenty of private feuds with them. And now this man of an inferior race,\nand a poor one too--for they throve principally upon goats--had dared to\nmake up to my twin-sister, and marry her, and demand her heritage!\n\n\"And this was not the worst of it, for as soon as I entered Karthlos, my\ngood Steward, Kobaduk, a very faithful servant, told me that beyond any\ndoubt Rakhan, the Osset, had compassed and probably with his own hand\ncommitted the murder of my father, S\u00c3\u00bbr Dadian. I replied that the Imaum\nhimself had assured me that the Russians were guilty of that crime, and\nthis had impelled me to quit all friends and hurry without going home to\nBodlith. But he spat on the ground, as our peasants do, when they hear\nof a black deception, and soon proved to me that the Czar's troops were\nguiltless; and not only so, but that Shamyl the Tartar--as he was\nfrequently called in contempt--knew as well as Kobaduk did, that there\nwas not a Russian within miles of Karthlos, when that cowardly shot was\nfired. Moreover, the foremost of my father's men who had spurred along\nthe defile, made oath that he saw a white globe whirl away where the\ncrags broke apart in the distance, and he put his jaded horse to the\nutmost speed, all in vain among darkness and precipices. Now every one\nknows that no Russian soldier, and the Ossets alone in our part of the\nrange can be found with that hideous head-gear flapping, a sheep-skin\npuffed out into a ball at the top, like a great white onion at the end\nof a stick. And there was other evidence as well as this.\n\n\"My twin-sister, my only near of kin, for my father had no other\nchildren--was I likely, although she had acted thus, to rob her of a\nsingle copek? Nay, rather would not every one of mine be at her service?\nAt the same time, could any son endure that his good father should be\nrobbed not only of life but also of a third part of his property by a\nscoundrel of inferior race, who had stolen his daughter for that very\nend. Thereupon I was compelled to believe--for charity is by St. Paul\ndescribed as the greatest of Christian virtues, but he does not appear\n(though a native of Cilicia) to have travelled in the Caucasus, as Peter\ndid, otherwise never could he have retained enough of that virtue to\ndescribe it--young as I was, the conviction grew upon me that Prince\nRakhan, the Osset, had murdered my father, S\u00c3\u00bbr Dadian, because he had\nrefused him his daughter Marva. Instead of answering the letter\ntherefore in which he demanded his portion, I set forth with a few\ntroopers well armed to pay him a visit in his stronghold at Zacca, near\nthe fountains of the Ardon river.\n\n\"Some parts of our own land are desolate enough, but this country where\nthe Ossets lived had scarcely a tree to make the world look living; and\nhaving had no war in their neglected places to civilize them with the\npassage of guns, they seemed to be quite outside all knowledge. Yet to\nmy surprise, they looked down upon our race, which we for generations\nhad been wont to do to them; and with better reason, as all others will\nadmit. We rode very fine Khabarda steeds, which are the best of all the\nCaucasus, but we were obliged to leave them in the bed of a little\nsnow-river at last, and appear at the entrance on foot, as if we\nexpected to be shot at.\n\n\"Nobody shot at us, chiefly perhaps because few of them had learned the\nway to shoot; but there was not one of them who required any lessons in\nthe art of staring. And to think that such people looked down upon us!\nAll their houses had hideous towers, as if their lives were spent in\nlooking out from the tops; and my heart went low, as I thought of my\nlively and lovely sister Marva, who had been brought up like a French\ngirl almost, extinguished and deadened among such clods. And I had not\neven the chance of learning how she liked the lot she had cast for\nherself. Perhaps she may have seen me from some tower--for they have\nnarrow loops instead of windows--but she never showed her face to me,\nnor sent me any message.\n\n\"We shouted, and made noise enough to fling all the rocky echoes into a\nBabel of dispute with one another, and if we could have found the butt\nend of a tree, we would have made a rush for it and rammed the heavy\ngate. At last a surly fellow put his head out at a loophole, and rubbed\nhis eyes as if we had broken his repose. I did not understand their\nlanguage then, though I came to know it afterwards; but some of my men\nmade out this delivery--'Sons of the Evil One, ye shall not rob us. The\nnoble Prince Rakhan is far off; but we will fight until he returns. Ye\nwill be slain by thundering guns, unless ye cease this uproar.'\n\n\"We could not believe that Osset robber; for the people of the village\nhad told us that the Chief and his bride were both at home; but I tore a\nleaf out of my order-book, and wrote a letter upon it, and handed it up\non the point of a lance. It contained no insolence, though that was\nrumoured afterwards, but only these words which a man of honesty would\nhave met according to their intention. 'S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar to Prince Rakhan. If\nyou will come to Karthlos, bringing with you the relics of St. Anthony,\nand upon them swear that you have had no hand in the death of my dear\nfather, I will deliver to you all the portion of my sister Marva, and\nadd thereto my own present to her, and acknowledge you as a brother.'\n\n\"This I signed with some hope of better feeling; for I knew that they\nhad in this savage place no small piece of St. Anthony, and having three\nmen who could make a cross, I secured all three as witnesses; and then\nwe marched away from this inhospitable desert. But the worst of the\nbusiness was not over yet, for when we returned to the spot where we had\ntethered our horses very carefully, not one of them was there except my\nown, and he was loose, but ran to me. Him alone those Ossets had not\nstolen, because he could bite as well as kick, and would let none but\nhis master handle him. We ran back to the village, but there was not a\nsoul there, except a few children yelling. All these we put into one hut\nfar apart, and then set fire to all the rest. But being of stone they\nburned very unkindly, and having no time to make a good job of it, we\nshook the Ossetian dust from our feet, and made off in hope as well as\nfear of having all the mad savages after us.\n\n\"How, among a people thus divided, could there be any chance of solid\nresistance to a mighty nation like Russia, acting in unity, and able to\nreplace every man killed with a dozen just as good? There was not a\ntribe among us that would join its neighbour, for any other purpose than\nthe plunder of a third; and when this was carried off, the victorious\npair were sure to have another fight about the booty, before they were\nhalf-way home again. A quarrel was now set up between my people and\nthose of Prince Rakhan, which would probably last for generations; not\nso much about my father's murder--for that was a matter of suspicion\nonly, and chiefly concerned his next of kin--but about the theft of\nthose well-bred horses, and the firing of that worthless village. And\nwhen I received a letter of insult in the Georgian language, from the\nman who had so injured me, the only thing that surprised me was his\nability to write it. For though he spent much of his time at Tiflis,\nwhenever he could scrape up coin enough, it was not for the purpose of\nimproving his mind, even if he had any to embellish. That problem\nhowever was speedily solved; for the writing was my sister's.\n\n\"'Imar, son of Dadian. Twice hast thou wronged me, thy brother in the\nLord. Thou hast robbed me of my portion of thy father's goods, and thou\nhast set fire to my wealthiest village, destroying men, women, and\nchildren. Though thou art now a great man of battle, and strong among\nthe strongest, so that thy name is as that of Minghi Tau, yet shall that\nmighty head be fetched down, and those strong hands shall feed the dogs\nof Kektris. The only hope left thee of escaping this destruction is if\nthou sendest to the glacier of Gumaran, before the snows fill up the\nvalley again, gold and cattle, and household goods, according to the\nnumber herein set down, which is far less than thou owest me, and will\nnot make peace between us for the village thou hast destroyed. But this\nif thou doest, I will pray for thy repentance, and thy sister whom thou\nhast robbed will permit thee to look upon her face again. Rakhan, Prince\nof the noble Ossets.'\n\n\"There was also another signature, broken and crooked, as if the hand\nhad been seized in another, and compelled to shape the name of _Marva_.\nThen I hoped that my sister had not turned against me in her heart,\nthough constrained by her fierce and wicked husband; and I ordered the\nmessenger to wait, and fed him with dainties that he knew not how to\nhandle, while I preserved my temper even against the insult of that\naddress. For now I was entitled to be addressed as _S\u00c3\u00bbr_, of which we\nthink more than the common word _Prince_; for it is a designation of\nwarlike rank, imported from the furthest Orient, and ascribed to none\nbut a Chief who has led his tribe into battle with a foreign foe.\nScorning to show anger, I wrote thus--\n\n\"'Accursed murderer of my father, and serpent robber of my sister. Thou\nhast piled up a mountain of lies, so vast, and of such deadly blackness,\nthat the snow of thy guile cannot cover them. A man of lower rank than\nmine may descend into the filth where thou grovellest, and strive to vie\nwith thee in vermin. But I will leave thee to the Lord, who heedeth the\nsmallest thing that He hath deigned to make. Yet that my sister be not a\nwidow, one thing I will say to thee. Let not the right bank of the Terek\nbe tainted by thine evil-smelling body. Lest, for the sake of those whom\nthe Heaven valueth, it be plunged into the bottomless bog. For verily\nthere are foul reeks of Satan, sent by his malice to corrupt the air.'\n\n\"Now this was not intended as an offering of peace--though many people\ntook it altogether in that light, not from the moderation of the\nlanguage only, but because I sent not the wonted double dagger with\nit--but simply as an overture of justice, in language not too mealy, and\nan opening for reconciliation. For Marva, my sister, I felt many pangs,\na hankering which I endeavoured to repress, a tenderness of the younger\ndays, when neither could have the skin broken without a burst of tears\nfrom the other's eyes. But we have to get harder as we go on, and the\nhold of soft love on our little thumbs grows slacker; and even sweet\ntwins (who have tumbled into one another's arms, and rolled over with\nrollicking, till no one could tell which was which of them) must begin\nto close palm, and even shut fist, to the kisses of each other. And with\nall this affection heavy on my mind, and a good guard left upon the\nsteeps of Karthlos, I returned for the summer to Shamyl.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nIMAR'S TALE--LOVE\n\n\n\"Perhaps you have gathered from my words already some idea of the\ncharacter of Shamyl. An idea, and not a perception, was all that his\ndearest friends could have of him, because he had no dear friends at\nall. And yet he was a man of warm nature, and kept nobody at a distance\nfrom him; neither was there any haughtiness, though abundance of\nrudeness, about him. Men put up with the latter, and even like it (when\nshown to their friends) and talk pleasantly about it, and the little\nruffle passes over, every one expecting that his friend will be the next\nto get it. But cold universal arrogance makes the greatest of\nmankind--if such can show it--universally detested.\n\n\"I believe that Shamyl was by nature kind,--though he did some\nabominably brutal things,--and that if he had not taken into his head,\nor had it put there by flatterers, that Allah had breathed into him the\nbreath of Mohammed, he would have been one of the noblest, as well as\nthe purest perhaps, of patriots. Peace be with him, for he was at least\nsincere, which cannot be said of all leading minds, and he understood\nother men at a glance, though he may not have looked very much into his\nown man.\n\n\"I fear that it may be ungrateful on my part not to speak even more\nhighly of him. For he took a great liking to me in his way, although I\nwas not of his creed; neither did I pretend to any personal hatred of\nthe Russians, who are generally very kind of nature,--more so perhaps\nthan we are,--and only did their duty in shooting us straightforwardly.\nNeither did I pretend to any special love of him, but carried out his\norders as a soldier should, unless they were worse than even war\ndemands, in which case I told him to seek elsewhere. Therefore I was\nsurprised, as much as any man acquainted with him could be surprised,\nwhen he took me aside one day and said: 'S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, I have an important\nmission for thee, which I would intrust to no other. Many of my officers\nare rough and wild, and have no command over themselves with women. My\nson is a prisoner with the Russians; and I have a noble scheme for\nrecovering him, and perhaps a hundred thousand crowns to boot. But it is\na dangerous enterprise, and must be carried out with proper delicacy to\nladies.'\n\n\"This was a very high compliment to me, being still a young man in the\nfervour of my days; but the Captain had heard of stern actions of mine,\nwhen some of his men had shown rudeness to those who could not take up\narms to protect themselves.\n\n\"'Thou hast the best horse in the army,' he continued, with his deep\neyes fixed upon my glowing cheeks, as the spirit of adventure began to\nrise, 'and there is not a stronger man among us, neither one to surpass\nthee in activity. All this will be needed, and boldness too, tempered\nwith skill and discretion. I would go myself, for the work is worthy of\nme, but I cannot leave the camp just now. My design is to carry off from\ntheir summer encampment all the ladies of the Russian and the Georgian\nCourt. Not a hair of their heads shall be harmed, and we will treat them\nas princesses, but hold them for the ransom of my dear son, and a good\nround sum for the military chest. The Powers of the West have been\nstingy to us, when we might have done them excellent service; but we\nwill make the Russian bear supply a little grease for our bullets; for\nthe ladies are of the highest rank. But the whole scheme fails, if even\none of them should be ill-treated.'\n\n\"This was the only point about which I felt uneasiness; but he gave me\npermission, and even clear orders, to shoot on the spot any man who\nmisbehaved. And when he allowed me to take fifty of my tribe, as well as\nfifty chosen men of his, my only anxiety was to start as soon as\narrangements could be made, and before any rumour of our plans should\nget abroad. For I knew all those southern stretches of the mountains\nwell, and that perhaps induced him to appoint me in command.\n\n\"He told me that trusty friends near the Georgian capital had informed\nhim that the early summer heat had made the city in the deep hollow by\nthe river almost unbearable for ladies of the north; and therefore the\nwives and daughters of the principal Russian officers, together with the\nnoblest of the Georgian women, had been sent to a cooler spot among the\nhills in the healthy district of Kahiti, celebrated for its vineyards.\nLittle expecting any danger there so far from the Lesghian outposts,\nthey were lodged in a pleasant place under canvas, guarded by a scanty\ndetachment of Cossacks, most of whom had been invalided from the war.\nPounce upon them suddenly, and what could they do but scream? Even this\nthey would not do very long, according to Shamyl's opinion, but soon be\nhappy when they found themselves made much of, and enjoy the romance of\nthe situation, and the high price put upon them. This prediction, to my\nsurprise, proved wonderfully correct; for many of the younger ladies\npermanently added to the beauty of our country and the quality of its\ninhabitants; while those who preferred restoration declared that they\nwould have no higgling about them,--if their husbands attempted to\ncheapen their price, let them even remain among the gallant men who put\nthem at a higher figure. But this is a later matter, and I only mention\nit to show the good feeling we created.\n\n\"Litters, and light carts, and other conveyances were sent in advance of\nus over the worst places, with orders to wait in a valley we described;\nand with all the best horses we could procure, we set forth at sunrise\none summer morning, so as to traverse the most dangerous part of the\njourney in good daylight. We rode very leisurely to keep our horses\nfresh, until in the afternoon of the second day, we halted in a hollow\nof the lower mountains to make a good meal, and learn more exactly where\nthe encampment of the ladies was. Here were a hundred of us, all good\nhorsemen, and accustomed to despise the enemy,--not for want of courage,\nbut for want of wit. In courage they were quite our equals, for they\nnever seemed to care much about their lives; but when briskness and\nreadiness turned the issue, the vigour of the free man could upset the\nbulk of serfs. This we had proved a hundred times against the weight of\nnumbers.\n\n\"Being in command of this dainty enterprise, and having to prove that I\nwas not too young, which always puts a youth upon his very finest\nmettle, I took all the precautions of an old commander. Ordering all the\nothers to keep close, and having only Stepan and the best of our guides\nwith me, I proceeded very carefully afoot along the course of a stream\nfrom the hills, which had worn a deep channel. We knew where the ladies\nought to be; and though a man must not rely too much on that, sure\nenough there they were by the dozen. Their encampment was pitched upon a\nvery pretty knoll, not more than a long eyeshot from the nearest bend of\nthe watercourse we crouched in. I put my red plume between my knees, and\nwatched them, being surprised at the beauty of their dress, and the far\ngreater beauty of their figures. The proudest radiance of the Russian\nCourt was there, and the softer charms of Georgia; and I was glad not to\nsee those lovely faces, which it would be my duty to bedew with tears so\nsoon.\n\n\"Having counted their tents, three of which were royal, and made myself\nsure of their position, I left all those beauties at their tea outside,\nwith the sunset casting their shadows down the slope, and saying to\nmyself, 'Where will you have your breakfasts, Mesdames?' stole back with\nmy two comrades, to make ready for this prize. Stepan, who was always\nfull of strong ideas, and never confined them to himself, did his utmost\nto convince me that the wisest plan was to let all these houris go\nsnugly to bed, and then catch them up as they were in their first\nslumber, and whirl them away on our saddles. But I could not bear to\nthink of this outrage on their modesty; and one figure in a silver pink\ndress was in my mind,--the youngest and the loveliest of all I had\ndescried. Therefore I made ready to descend upon these ladies before\nthey should begin to retire for the night, which they would not do until\nthey had supped well and probably played their games of cards.\n\n\"We had little fear of sentries, for there were not more than a dozen,\nand no sign of any horse-patrol about; and even of the few fellows\nlounging round the tents, and ordered to keep at a proper distance from\nthem, we got rid by the old device of sending a boy on a donkey with a\nflagon of vodka on either side. They showed their alacrity by robbing\nhim of these, and then retiring to their hut, with the officer on duty\nto take first pull. When the moon was up, and we rode softly over the\nsod of alluvial ground, the only challenge we received was the screech\nof a Russian drinking-chorus round the corner of the trees. Without\nfiring a shot, or disturbing a dog, we surrounded the camp of the fair\nones, and called upon them to surrender. At the same time we entreated\nthem to prepare in silence for their departure with us, if they valued\nthe lives of their guardians.\n\n\"This exhortation was of no effect. Amazement and terror quite overcame\ntheir natural discretion, and we found it impossible to parley with\nthem. So great was the outcry that we stood aghast, till those faithful\nCossacks came running, or rather staggering to the rescue, which\nrestored our power of action. We bound them in couples to convenient\ntrees with some ropes we had brought for the purpose; and then as the\nladies still declined to join us, we wrapped all the most important of\nthem in their cloaks, and placed them on our horses. In this they\nassisted us to some extent, by kindly disclosing the rank of each other.\nThus we obtained all who were of any value from a financial point of\nview, twenty-two of sterling substance; and at their entreaty and\nassurance of amendment we took a domestic for each of them, and turned\nour horses' heads towards the glen where the vehicles awaited us.\n\n\"My instructions were to leave no room for doubt as to our possession of\nsix Princesses, whose names I will not give, because most of them, I\ntrust, are still alive, and none the worse for their captivity. Enough\nthat they were of exalted rank, and in command--as the Russian ladies\ncontrive to be--of the Commanders of the army opposed to us. Therefore,\nbefore we started, I stood upon the terrace in front of the tents, with\nour horses pawing the turf, which was almost a novel treat to them, and\nthe white moon making a picture of us. And there with great deference\nand courtesy, I called over from the list provided me the names of their\nincomparable Highnesses, the Princess O----, and the Princess D----,\n&c.; and each of them made answer according to temperament, and sense of\nresignation to the will of Heaven. Then I gave the word to start, and\nremained the last, to bring up the rear as in duty I was bound.\n\n\"But suddenly a slender and timid figure came gliding, as if in the\nhaste of despair, from the shadow of a tent, and stood close to me. It\nwas the lovely maiden in the silver-pink attire, and she drew her veil\npartly aside, and glanced in the clear moonlight at my face, and then\ndropped her dark eyes, and then lifted them again with quivering tears\nlike a suppliant--'Oh, Captain, am I to be left behind?'\n\n\"'Lady, have no fear,' I said very gently, and half afraid to look again\nat her; 'you shall not be left unguarded. But tell me who you are, the\nfairest and the youngest of so many.'\n\n\"'Alas, sir, I am not worth money now,' she answered with her white\nhands clasped together; 'there is none of my race to pay ransom now.\nThere is not even a wealthy friend, to help, or to shelter Oria.'\n\n\"'The Princess Oria, the lily-bud of Kajori, the last of the Royal House\nof Georgia, to which the race of Rurik is a mushroom! Princess Oria, I\ndo you homage.'\n\n\"As I made her a low salute, which I would not have offered to the Czar\nhimself, she turned away as if she would not see it, and a soft sob made\nme feel afraid. This was not one of your haughty mesdames, who let the\nmen fancy that they carry them by storm, while they laugh in their own\nproud breasts, with knowledge that they are the Masters, as soon as they\nlike. I could hear the Princess D. in the distance, rating the man who\ncarried her on the cushion provided in front of him, and I knew that he\nhad a bad time of it.\n\n\"'What are the commands of your Royal Highness?' I asked, with an\nemphasis on the title, which she alone of the proud bevy could claim.\n'Behold, I am proud to be your slave.'\n\n\"She rose to the remembrance of her childhood, when she had been made\nmuch of, as the last descendant of Queen Tamara; and then her pride\nmelted into a flood of tears, and the sense of helpless maidenhood. She\ntried to say something, but it only came to sobs.\n\n\"'Trust yourself to me,' I said, 'I cannot leave you here at the mercy\nof drunken Cossacks. I am S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar of the Lesghians, not a Moslem, but a\nChristian. By the body of Christ, none shall harm you, while I live.'\n\n\"There was no time for further adjurations. She bowed her beautiful\nhead, and drew down her long veil, and in a moment the love of my life\nwas in my arms, and on the soft pillow in front of me, with my horse at\nfull gallop, in the broad stretch of the moon. Like an image of marble\nshe lay before me, and I touched her as if she were an image of glass.\nThe troopers were astonished when we overtook them, but they knew better\nthan to say a word, or down they would have gone, Russian Princess and\nall. For I was not in the cue to stand insolence. Having given my orders\nI kept in the rear, grudging even the moon between the bars of shadow a\nglimpse at the figure in my precious trust. But no man can think of such\nthings, and then tell them. For, they only come once in the nightmare of\nlife.\n\n\"Shamyl was delighted, when we brought him his fair prisoners, and he\ndid his very best in his peasant style to be courteous and polite to\nthem. As the leader of the expedition I had the privilege of introducing\nthem; and it was really a fine thing to see how they behaved to him, and\nhe to them. He gave himself airs which made me smile; and before so much\nrank and beauty--infidel though it might be--he forgot for the moment\nthat he was the Prophet of the Lord. And as for the ladies, although\nthey were bound in consistency to abhor him, not only did they forego\nthe attempt, but all who had rank to make such a claim decent, insisted\nupon having a lock of his hair.\n\n\"In a word, the Princesses were all so happy, when by means of a flag of\ntruce they had received from their friends a large supply of raiment and\nother luxuries, that the hope of getting a first-rate figure for them\nwas endangered. Instead of frantic adjurations, and despairing\noutcries, their letters now were full of bright descriptions and gay\nnarratives; and proud as we were of their good opinions, we could not\nafford them to that extent. It became needful on this behalf to send the\nfair captives to a duller place, to some desolate spot, where even a\nwoman could not contrive to see much of the world. Darghi, in the depths\nof Daghestan, and far away even from the echoes, was a place of so lofty\na character that the fashions of the Ark were as valid as the latest\nannounced from Paris; and thither I was ordered to conduct these ladies,\nfor the creation of discontent among them, the scenery being beautiful,\nbut sparsely populated. And if the love of Nature were by any means as\npotent in the Russian breast as the English ladies now declare it to\nhave grown in theirs, perfect happiness should have been the lot of\nthese fair Princesses. There was nothing to disturb them, beauty reigned\non every side; and beauty should have reigned within.\n\n\"But alas that human nature never, at least in its feminine state and\nform, finds satisfaction in the outward type! Among the rugged\nmountains, and with frequent shift, and much discomfort, these fair\ncreatures had been bright, and cheerful, and perilously amiable. A flag\non a rock, or a drum at the corner, or the flash of a helmet in the\nhollow, was enough to send their active minds into fifty pleasant\nflutters. But here they had no stir of war, no delightful dreads to\nrouse them, only the depths of lonely peace, and the repose, for which\nthey had so often sighed. For a day or two, they tried to enjoy it, and\nspoke of the pleasures of their childhood, and roved about in cotton\njackets as if they were longing to be peasants. Our duty was to defend\nthem only, and never interfere with them, so long as they kept within\ncertain bounds; and we gave them no cause to complain of us; but\nendeavoured to do our duty well, as sentries of so many money-bags.\n\n\"Strange as it must appear, there was nothing that irritated them more\nthan this. They could not bear to be regarded in that light, and being\ntoo proud to come out of it themselves, what did they do but send their\nmaids--they may not have meant it, but so it came to pass--to produce a\nflirtation among my men. Precautions had been taken (as we thought)\nagainst any process of that sort, by detailing for this custody only\ngrizzled veterans, who had wives at home, and could not understand a\nsingle word of Russian. But this, though a step in the right direction,\ndid not go quite far enough; and several of our villagers beyond the\nprime of life behaved in a manner more appropriate to their sons. So\nthat I found myself compelled, in the proper discharge of my office, to\nuse increasing diligence from day to day. For one of the Russian ladies,\nbeing the mother of two little girls, had obtained permission to bring\nher favourite French governess, as lively a girl as ever lived, and\nacquainted with half-a-dozen languages. This Mademoiselle de J----,--for\nI will show her the same consideration as her wealthier comrades,--was\nperpetually forming little plots of the wildest and most romantic kind,\nfor the escape of all the captive band. With a view to that, she took\nupon herself to inspect me closely, every time I came to a little gate,\nnewly put across the pass, by my special orders, which had created much\noffence inside. There was no other way, by which these ladies, who now\nplaced every confidence in me, could manage to get away at all, without\nperpendicular motion; unless it were the narrow winding passage leading\ninto a sombre wood, and there I had 'Wolves!' painted up in great\nRussian capitals, so that few feminine eyes had the courage even to look\nat the signboard. And this is how it should be with them. For we do not\nwish them to be like us.\n\n\"I was trying to get out of that condition of the mind, into which I had\nbeen cast by a very few words, and still fewer glances from that lovely\nPrincess Oria, whom I remembered as a very little maiden leading some\nprocession, when I was a lad at Tiflis. If ever any boy has any heart to\nlose, when it ought to be gone upon play and mischief, mine had taken a\nsally out of me at sight of that young darling, trying to walk in a\nstately manner as she had been instructed, and resolute to bring her\nsoft innocent self to the stiffness of the great occasion. How I had\nlonged to lift her up among them and shout--'This is your Queen, if you\nhad a spark of courage. Behold the pink eagle on her shoulder!'\n\n\"But now it was a very different thing. The duty of an officer in trust\nwas laid upon me, and if the men of Georgia would not stand up for their\nrace, what had any outer tribe to do with it? The main point before me\nwas to conquer foolish yearnings, and behave as a figure made of steel\nand leather. And without the interference of that glittering little\ngoverness, the rapture and the anguish of my life would not have been.\n\n\"I came down the narrow pass one evening towards dusk, to see to the\nposting of the sentinels, and to receive any message from the ladies,\nconcerning their welfare and their general ideas; for they were\nbeginning to write very craving letters and entreaties that would move a\nheart of stone, to husbands and fathers who were made of money, to\nrescue them from this seclusion. All these we forwarded, and Shamyl\ncalculated that every letter would be worth to us a thousand roubles on\nthe average. But money was not in my thoughts at all, and even the sense\nof duty fled, when I saw through the bars not the French woman only, but\na figure very closely veiled, and endeavouring not to be seen in the\ntwilight of a rock.\n\n\"'Poor little soul! She will die, she will die;' said the lady from\nParis, with a very light sigh, as if with the thought that we must all\ndo that. 'Those fat Princesses, what is it then? They are punishing her\nto the death. Poor little one! But why do I speak to Monsieur the\nCommander? Monsieur the Commander will rejoice in that occurrence,\nbecause the poor little one is not endowed with gold. Alas, it is so\neverywhere, except in France!'\n\n\"'Young lady, allow me to enter. It is my place to see to the safety of\nyou all. I have not entered after sundown hitherto. But stand aside,\nlady, or you may be harmed.'\n\n\"She saw that I would break the gate open at a thrust,--for we allowed\nthem to lock themselves in at night. 'Monsieur the Commander, how\nimperious he is!' she exclaimed with a wicked smile, as she turned the\nkey. I thanked her, and then put my arm across the passage as the other\nyoung lady seemed about to fly. 'Pardon, fair Princess, but I cannot\nhave it thus,' I said, with an attempt to look official; 'I am not your\nwarder only, but your guardian. You trusted yourself to my care that\nnight. A thousand Shamyls shall not take you from me. Can you not trust\nyourself to me again? Have I given you reason to regret it? I have\nlonged to be with you every moment; but have I ever dared to approach\nyou?' I spoke in her native language, which was very delightful to her\nears after so much Russian.\n\n\"'Speak then with good courage, thou silly child. Tell the brave\nCommander all the insults piled upon thee by the proud and fat\nPrincesses. Alas, good Heaven, there they are calling me again! Who\nwould not think that I was born to be their slave? Brave Commander, the\ntime is now for thee.' With these words away ran Mademoiselle de J----.\n\n\"Then Oria spoke, without shrinking from me, and her voice was as clear\nas the melody of a river when the Winter has released it, and the Spring\nis on its banks.\n\n\"'S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, thou hast been very good to me. If I placed no confidence in\nsuch a kind defender, never could I hope to be defended any more. But\nnow I am safe among all these great ladies; I am not one of those who\nshriek at every shadow.'\n\n\"'To that I can bear witness,' I answered very softly, to remind her of\nthe night when she lay upon my horse; 'but what can I do, if the\nPrincess will not trust me?'\n\n\"At this gentle reproach all her generous nature sprang forth, like the\nsun in a tempest. She threw aside her veil, and came close to me, and\nwas not afraid to fix her eyes on mine. 'S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, is that faith\nenough?' she asked, as she gave me her soft hand long enough to last for\nmany an hour of dreaming. 'It is all I can ask for the present,' I\nreplied, and she turned away her face, but not her form.\n\n[Illustration: \"_She turned away her face._\"]\n\n\"Fearing to bring her into contumely among her proud companions, whose\nvoices we could hear not far away, I retired from the gate with the\nproper martial tread; but not before I had obtained her promise to meet\nme on the morrow at the foot of the winding passage into the black wood;\nbut she was not to venture up the path, until she saw me there; for\ntruly there had been a wolf prowling near it, according to the children\nof the peasants. Therefore I had taken care to keep our golden ladies\nfrom risking ten thousand good crowns perhaps apiece to the cause of\nfreedom (which they were ready to embrace, as soon as they knew both\nsides of it), by venturing into those gaunt and lonely shadows, where no\nman could hear them while being devoured.\n\n\"In this assurance I had every hope of treating confidentially the\nposition of the Princess Oria; and if that desirable wolf would only\nform number three at the interview, who could say what might come of it?\nBut even his youngest cub, if he had any, might have regarded me with\ncontempt, if he had seen the condition I was in, while waiting for the\nfootstep of my love; for they look at such matters in a less submissive\nway.\n\n\"Unworthy as I was of the joy I then attained, even the pleasure of\nremembering it would be justly taken from me, if I lowered it by any\nordinary words. For any one else it seems enough to know that after some\ntalk of affairs in general, and trifles we pretended to be full of, my\nbeauty, my darling, my gift from Heaven, my own and my only love\nconfessed--that I was as much to her as she could be to me.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt this point, the Lesghian Prince became unable to proceed with his\nnarrative. I felt that I should have been ten times worse, if I had won\nand then lost his daughter. So I grasped his strong hand, which was\ntrembling not a little, and hoping that soft memories might subside to\ngentle sympathies, departed with my love for him increased, and my\nreverence not diminished. When I saw him next, he had gathered up his\ncourage, and was a little ashamed of his own breakdown. And he tried to\ntell the rest of his sad story, as if it were the sorrow of a cousin or\na comrade.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nIMAR'S TALE--PEACE\n\n\n\"Happiness appears to me to resemble the black eagle of the mountains\nmore than the fair dove of the proverb. Restless and swift of wing, it\nflutters, scarcely long enough for a hover, over any home of ours, and\neven then too high for us to be sure that we have seen it. Not until it\nis gone, can we believe that it has been with us; and we know in our\nhearts that to look for it destroys the chance of seeing it.\n\n\"Shamyl was in a rage that Oria dared to pledge her faith to me, without\nconsulting the 'Mountain-lion,' as his flatterers now called him.\nWhether he hoped to make money of her, or what other reason he may have\nhad, I will not pretend to say. But when by means of my good service,\nand without the loss of a single man, he secured all those fair prizes,\nand thus recovered his favourite son, not to mention an excellent sum in\ncash, and good wives for some of his officers, the least he should have\ndone in my opinion was to smile and pour his blessing upon the union of\nOria and Imar. Instead of that, on the very day when the last of the\nRussian ladies left the lonely recesses of Darghi, he sent a score of\nhis bodyguard, without even the courtesy of asking my consent, to escort\nthe Princess Oria to his own headquarters.\n\n\"Bad breeding here made a great mistake, as it usually does among\ngentlemen. For if he had sent his orders to me, as the officer to whom\nhe had intrusted the captives, I should have felt myself bound to obey\nhim, however much against my liking. But being treated in this rough\nmanner, which the Avar Chief was too fond of employing, I threw off at\nonce my allegiance to him,--which was not that of a tribesman, and had\nbeen already encroached upon a little too uncouthly. For at present he\nwas quite prosperous, and seemed well able to hold his own,--though the\nenemy had begun already their new plan of campaign, by which they\nprevailed in the end against him,--so that there could be no dishonour\nin leaving him with his glory. If the Russians had been pressing on him,\nI would not have quitted him; though nothing would have made me leave\nthe Princess at his mercy. For when she confided herself to me, what\nthings I said, and what vows I made, and what contempt I truly felt for\nevery human being who thought lightly of such loftiness! Those officers\nwho came with Shamyl's orders, were as faithful as could be to him; but\nten times as many would not have availed to march my Oria eastwards.\n\n\"'This lady goes with me,' I said, 'she will be my wife in three days'\ntime, just when you rejoin the camp. I will give you a letter to that\neffect to the inspired Commander. My men also will come with me; and if,\nas the General, he has any need of them hereafter, they will be at his\nservice. You know that I do not speak in vain.'\n\n\"They all knew that, and many no doubt wished that they also were\nhomeward bound. They went one way, and we the other; and the sons of\ngloomy Islam heard the songs of our rejoiceful faith borne back to them\nthrough the mountain passes, by the soft air from the west.\n\n\"For three or four years after that, I led a very peaceful life, happy\nin the perfect love of Oria, and the esteem of my faithful tribe. Being\nthoroughly versed in mountain war, we made ourselves respected by the\nbadly armed and undisciplined races to the westward and the north of us.\nIf they attempted an inroad, as their manner was, upon us, for their\nsakes we regretted it, but for our own were gratified. Because instead\nof plundering us of our honest crops and cattle, they always lost their\nthievish own; so that we grew very comfortable, and poverty was unknown\namong us. We sternly repressed all robbery, and to afford an abiding\nlesson to neighbours of lax principle, we deprived them of the means of\noutrage, placing these under our own control. At one time the numerous\nOsset tribes, far beyond Rukhan's rule, promised to join him in the\nplunder of our prosperity. But before they could mature their\ncontradictory ideas, we passed with a chosen band through their only\nfruitful places, obtaining many specimens of things we cannot cultivate,\nand leaving them so much to talk of that they fell with one accord upon\none another. So that they were compelled to send a humble petition to us\nfor seed, as soon as the sun came back again.\n\n\"These little matters kept our arms from rusting, and our bodies from\ntorpor. We injured no one who did not require it, and we taught them to\nabstain from injury. We encouraged literature in every village\npossessing two men who could read, and within ten miles of Karthlos\nTower there were five or six poets growing. All this I mention not by\nway of vaunt, but to show how much can be accomplished, when the mind is\neasy.\n\n\"But alas before these great reforms had taken solid root with us, the\nfinal advance of the Russian forces hurried us to the war again. Shamyl,\nthe gallant patriot, who had for a generation baffled the power of a\nboundless empire, was at last being crushed by weight of numbers, and\nworn out by perpetual blows. By forcing his scanty troops together, and\nclosing the defiles around them, the stubborn invaders now had him in a\ngrip, like a wolf blocked in his own den to starve. He called upon all\nwho had shared his successes to help him in this last resource; and loth\nas I was to leave my happy home and peaceful villages, honour and good\nfaith must not be starved by our prosperity.\n\n\"My sweet wife, who had never admired the great Captain as the Russian\nladies did, prayed and wept and coaxed in vain; she brought my two\nchildren, the boy and the girl, to show me that I ought to think of more\nthan mere abstractions. Innocent flesh of my own flesh, and tender bone\nof my own bone, and eyes more bright than any star in all the sky of\nglory, what had the 'Wolf of the mountains' done to make me love him\nmore than these? I stood at the gate with my arm around her trembling\nform; and my beautiful boy, just three years old, clung to my leg and\nkissed my knee, and the little baby always wise, who now has come to be\nDariel, looked at me through her mother's hair, with the sparkle of the\nbrighter world babes come from still unquenched by earth. What was pride\nto me, or glory, if I could not find them here? But love has never yet\nsufficed to keep a man contented. He grows ashamed of living in it; and\nhis manhood argues that if he lets his darlings wrap it all in warmth\nand softness, it will soon cease to be worth their care. I put my wife\nand children by, with a prayer to the Lord to protect them, and went to\ndo my duty.\n\n\"How often I looked back, and thought--as all I loved grew further\noff--that a man's first duty is to those who cannot live without him.\nMoreover, that I should be punished for casting eyes upon and longing\nfor stirring rather than steadfast life. Badly begun, and sadly ended,\nwas to be the rule of it. At the outset thus our little band (familiar\nas they once had been with every twist of the mountain-chain and every\ntangle of the gorges) had managed, by living in peace so long, to get\ntheir memories confused. And even when they hit upon the way, they found\nit stopped by Cossack outposts at the very points that we used to guard.\nBut after many a climb and crawl, we contrived to rejoin the brave\nImaum.\n\n\"I was admitted to him at once, and saw by the weariness of his eyes,\nand the looseness of his attitude, that he knew it was all over. He was\nsitting at a table with the lamp behind him, and his shaggy head thrown\nbackward, so that the light played down the furrows of his heavy\nforehead, as from below one sees the moon glistening down a wrinkled\nsteep. With his usual scorn of ceremony he did not rise, but grasped my\nhand.\n\n\"'Imar, thou art a man,' he said, with his guttural voice, such as all\nthe Avars have, now a little tremulous. 'If all had been as true as\nthou, I should not look like this to-night. It is Russian gold that has\nconquered us. To-morrow I surrender.'\n\n\"This was such a shock to me, that I could not reply immediately. Not\nthat I cared for the cause of Islam, to which he had been devoted;\nneither did I detest the Russians, or dream that we, with so many races\nall at feud with one another, could ever form a nation. But I felt as\nany true man would feel, a reverence for this dauntless hero (who had\nheld his own so long against resistless odds) and sorrow at the close of\na career so grand.\n\n\"'I have fought a good fight. I have held the faith. I have not striven\nfor my own glory, but in the cause of God most High. If it is His Holy\nwill to forsake us, there is no more for man to do.'\n\n\"It was useless of course to argue with him. A man at all open to\nargument would not have done much against Russia. And when I met my few\nsurviving friends among his gallant officers, they told me that his last\ndefence was gone, his force reduced to four hundred men, and all his\ninaccessible retreats cut off. The enemy had blocked him in his last\nhole; for his own life he cared little, as he had proved a thousand\ntimes; but the few who still remained faithful to him, and were ready to\ndie at his side, surely it would have been a mean requital to drive them\nlike sheep into the butcher's yard. Therefore must he yield at last.\n\n\"We were talking dismally about all this, and saying that the mountains\nwould never again be fit for a gentleman to live in, when I received\nanother call to Shamyl's room, and had another interview with him. He\nhad spent some time in prayer, and been rewarded with a holy vision from\non high, so that his eyes were full of fire, and his countenance shone\nwith happiness. One would scarcely believe that gloom and ferocity so\noften darkened that wondrous face.\n\n\"'I have received the word of the Lord, the holy voice of Allah, to whom\nbe all praise and glory! Imar of the Kheusurs, it is not for thee to\nhear it, being but an outer infidel. It is commanded that thou shouldest\ndepart from among the chosen warriors of heaven, that they who bear\nwitness be of the true faith. If thou and thy men can escape, behold it\nis my duty to aid thee. And verily I rejoice, for thou hast been a\nfaithful friend to us.'\n\n\"If he rejoiced, I could tell him of some one who rejoiced a\nhundred-fold, to escape a Russian jail and exile from his wife and\nchildren, even if his life were spared; of which there was no certainty,\nafter the many atrocities committed by my very noble friend. Perhaps it\nwas not magnanimous on my part to decline--if good luck should allow\nit--the glory of being shot or starved for the sake of the beloved\ncountry. But a lot of cross tangles came into that question. Was it my\ncountry in the first place? If it was, should I help it by quitting it\nso? And again, would that beloved land show equal love to me when gone,\nby attending to my belongings? No land I have heard of has ever done\nthat. Therefore I showed my love of my country, by deciding to remain\ninside it.\n\n\"'Commander of the Caucasus,' I said, knowing that he liked that\nappellation, though he never commanded half of it; 'a revelation such as\nthine is not to be disregarded. But how is it to be carried out? By many\ndevices, and some fighting, we have made our way to thee. But the foe\nhath closed in at our heels. Our little band could never hope to pass\nthe Russian lines again. Thrice hast thou come to life again, when the\nenemy proclaimed thee dead. But this is beyond even thy resources.'\n\n\"He smiled, with the pleasant smile of a man who feels himself\nunderrated. 'Imar, it is not that I am beaten in the powers of the\nmind,' he said, 'but never was there mortal born, and filled with the\nbreath of the Lord from birth, who could vanquish the love of gold in\nmen. The son of Manoah could not do it; neither even our Great Prophet.\nI, who have gifts from Heaven also, suited to a weaker age, am beaten by\nthat accursed Power. It is gold alone that hath vanquished Shamyl.'\n\n\"Believing that this upon the whole was true, I left him to his sad\nreflections. But presently he raised his head again, and looked at me\nwith his old grim smile. He spread out his woolly arms, and spoke with a\nlarge mouth quivering.\n\n\"'Knowest thou that I could carry off every man of my four hundred left,\nand laugh at the Russian beleaguerers? This night I would do it, and let\nthem smell for us in the morning. But to what effect? To kill a Russian\nis no dinner. All the passes are closed against us, and all our villages\noccupied. The winter is nigh; we should be no more than hungry wolves\nupon the mountains. But thou art young, thou hast a home to go to, and\nart not of our religion. Take thy faithful fifty, and go this night. My\nson will show thee how. No more.'\n\n\"That was the last I saw of Shamyl, and this much I will say for him.\nHe never sent any man to face a peril which he himself would shrink\nfrom, neither did he fight for his own ambition, or hide in his turban\none copek. The Russians behaved very generously and even nobly to him;\nand in the quiet evening of his days he may have looked back with sorrow\nupon his barbarities against them.\n\n\"Our little band had never shared in any of those atrocities. Therefore\nit would be better for us, if we could not escape capture, to fall into\nthe hands of the foe as a separate detachment, than to surrender with\nthe General. And this was my reason for attempting an escape, rather\nthan any fair prospect of success in such a situation. But strange to\nsay, by means of a tunnel in the cliff unknown to the enemy, and then\nsome most perilous scaling of rocks--such as Englishmen delight in, but\na native of the mountains prefers to do by deputy--and then some\nmidnight rushes through blockaded passes and defiles, we contrived with\nthe loss of two men only to regain our own abodes. But more than a month\nhad thus been spent after we quitted Shamyl, in wandering, fighting, and\nlying close, going out of our way for sustenance, and being driven out\nof it by enemies and tempests. With 50,000 men to stop them, not a horse\nto help them, no supplies to start with, and no village-folk to provide\nthem, nothing but the fruit the bears had left, to keep body and soul\ntogether--even veterans of Shamyl's training might have been proud to\nforce passage thus.\n\n\"Alas that we ever achieved it! For my men's sake I am glad, of course;\nbut for my own, I would that God had seen fit in His mercy to lay me\ndead by a Russian gun, or stretch me frozen on the mountain side!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nIMAR'S TALE--CRIME\n\n\n\"It was late of an October afternoon, when my heart, which had been low\nwith hunger, hardship, and long weariness, began to glow with hope and\nlove, as I stood at the bottom of our Karthlos steep. There was no\nfusilier on guard; and the granite steps and groins were choked with\nsnow; but I sent my followers to their homes, as was only fair to them,\nwith orders to come to a sheep-and-goat supper, if their appetites\nremained, when they had embraced their families. Then I sounded the\ngreat horn, fogged with cob-webs, hanging above the lower gate, and with\nonly my faithful milk-brother Stepan, and one other trooper who belonged\nto our old tower, breasted the rugged and crooked ascent.\n\n\"'How wild with delight will my Oria be!' I thought, as I laboured\nthrough the drifts, for there had been no opportunity of sending any\nletter. 'How lonely she must have been, sweet soul, and trembling with\nhope of a word from me!'\n\n\"But when we reached the upper gate, there was no one even there on\nguard. The brazen cannon once kept so bright were buried in winding\nsheets of snow; and even the terrace before the door, which it was a\npoint of hospitality to keep clean-swept for travellers, was glittering\nwith untrodden drift. We were all in such a ragged and savage state of\nbody, that I had ordered my two men to go round to the entrance for the\nmaidens, and meant to do the same myself, unless my darling met me. But\nnow, in my fierce anxiety, I thrust the main doors open, and stood in\nthe hall, which was cold and empty. No sound of my wife's step, no\npatter of little feet, no welcome, no answer, no gladness anywhere.\n\n\"Doubt and terror kept me standing there; but I shouted, in hope of some\ngreat mistake--'Oria, my wife, my wife!' And then, upon the chance that\nshe might be out--'Orry, my little son, my boy!'\n\n\"My call rang along the passages on either side, and up the stairs, and\nshook the plumes of mountain-grass, which she had placed in the vases;\nbut neither wife nor child appeared; and in my famished and haggard\nstate I fell upon a chair, and my heart began to beat, as if it would\nleap out of me. Then I saw a tall and stately lady, in a dress of\nvelvet, and with a serpent of white fur wound beneath her jewelled\nbosom, coming down the gray stone staircase, with her eyes fixed on me,\nbut not a word of speech.\n\n\"My voice failed me, as it does in a dream, when a sword is pointed at\none's throat; but the lady came and stood before me, and a child was\nclinging to her dress. She looked at me with some surprise, and contempt\nfor my ragged condition, but spoke as if she had never known a tear.\n\n\"'Imar, art thou not in haste to embrace thy twin sister Marva? The\nwrong thou hast done should not destroy all memory of the early days,\nwhen hers was thine, and thine was hers. I am prepared to forgive thee,\nImar, in this time of tribulation.'\n\n\"'To forgive! I never harmed thee, Va;' I answered, using her childish\nname, as I always did in thoughts of her. 'But none of that now. Where\nis my wife? Hath any one dared to injure her?'\n\n\"Weak as I was, I leaped up from the chair, and it would have gone ill\nwith Marva--for what is a sister compared to a wife?--if she had showed\nsigns of flinching. But she gazed at me with a quiet disdain, as if I\ncould not command myself.\n\n\"'I have not touched thy precious wife. I have not even set eyes on her.\nShe hath done the injury to me, that is worse than theft of goods and\ncattle. Yet have I come hither, to do the duty she hath forsaken, and\ncomfort her deserted husband from his mad adventures, while his\ntreasure of a wife, his Royal Princess Oria, heiress to a hundred\nthrones, is enjoying herself at the hot springs in the world of fashion\nand luxury, with my noble husband Rakhan.'\n\n\"What I said, or did, or thought, I know not--perhaps, nothing. The\nworld was all in a whirl with me, and perhaps I fainted, in my worn-out\nstate. It does not matter what I did. From the strongest man in the\nCaucasus, I was struck to the level of the weakest child. Even my twin\nsister, with a woman's petty spite inflamed by jealousy and bitter\nwrong, had some of the echoes of childhood roused, and thought of the\ntime when she loved me.\n\n\"'It is the part of a fool,' she said, meaning it for large comfort, 'to\nbe so wild about a woman, and the phantasy that they call love. When I\nwas a child, I believed in it; and to what has it brought me? To cast\naway my life upon a man, who swore that I was all the world to him, and\nbelieved it perhaps, while I was new. But lo, in a year he was weary of\nme, because I made too much of him. Hath Princess Oria done that? Nay,\nor thou wouldst be weary of her. Tush, what careth she for her lord? And\nwhy should he take it to heart like this? There are plenty of women in\nthe world, my brother; and the more their husbands make of them, the\nless will they return it. I am the one that should lament, not thou. For\nI have lost a man, but thou a woman only. My husband will come back to\nme when he is weary of thy Georgian doll; and I shall be forced to\nwelcome him. But thou, such is the law, thou hast it at thy pleasure to\nbe free.'\n\n\"'Talk not to me,' I said, for this was salt rubbed into my gashes; 'go\nand get me food, that I may recover a little of my strength. And then,\n_thou also shalt be free_.'\n\n\"Many a time have I wondered whether she knew what I meant by those last\nwords. If she knew it, she said nothing, but marched away in her stately\nstyle, dragging by the hand her child, who had been staring at my face\nall the time, as if he had never seen a man before. Marva's own servants\nbrought me food, and I knew not what it was, but took it, not for life\nso much as death--for death of Rakhan, the adulterer.\n\n\"Some sleep as well was needful to me, before I could accomplish\nthat,--sleep to restore the power of thought which seemed to have left\nme imbecile, as well as the vigour of my jaded body. No further would I\nenter my own house, but collected some rugs and bearskins--for we had\nnot even a bourka left--and was about to throw myself on a couch, when\nMarva's little boy came dancing, half in fright and half in glee at his\nown self-importance, with a crumpled letter for me. That she should send\nit by such hands is enough to show how she was changed. I saw that it\nwas from my enemy, and by the light of the one lamp they had brought me\nread the words that follow:--\n\n\n     \"'BELOVED BROTHER IMAR,--As thou hast given me to wife a beggar,\n     and a shrew to boot, it is but just that I should have a share of\n     thine to comfort me. She is soft and young and fair; and I have\n     taken such affection for her, and she for me, as the nature of\n     women is, that I will not charge thee for her clothes and lodgings\n     for at least a twelvemonth. Then if she hath a son, she shall\n     remain another twelvemonth; for Marva's child, though strong and\n     stout, is dumb from birth, and cannot be accepted therefore as\n     Chief Prince of Ossets. Son of Dadian, this relieves thee of the\n     cares that oppress thee most--the lust of money (which hath made\n     thee play the rogue), the peril of subservience to thy wife, which\n     overtaketh weak mankind, and the fear of having more children than\n     thine avarice would make welcome. Thou hast robbed me of good\n     substance; I relieve thee of light stuff. And even that, if thou\n     carest to lay claim, thou shalt have again without any charge. Thy\n     sister I leave to thy care meanwhile. She hath never had share of\n     her father's goods; and even thy greed cannot deny her meal and\n     milk, till her tongue grows mild. Her raiment is with her, and will\n     last until I am ready for her again. Unless thou dost relax of the\n     robbery thou hast rejoiced in for five years now, and givest her\n     the garments of her mother, as well as the third part of her\n     father's goods. Thy wife sends her duty to thee, and bids me say\n     that she likes thee still, but loves the man who hath his arm\n     around her, and doth not leave her to pine alone. We shall pass a\n     month at Patigorsk where the hot springs tend to warmth of love.\n     And then if thou hast aught to say, we shall not shut thee out\n     again, after doing this for thy benefit. Thy good brother RAKHAN,\n     Prince of the ancient Ossets.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nIMAR'S TALE--REVENGE\n\n\n\"In the morning I arose with all my strength renewed, and the sense of\nwrong as cold as stone, and keen as steel throughout me. My brother\nStepan was at my side, for he had come to watch me, knowing what I had\nendured, and fearing that it might outdo my sense of life. I smiled at\nhim; and he saw that I would smile, until I made others weep. Not a word\nwas said between us. My wrongs were hotter in his heart than in my own;\nfor I felt doubts about myself, and he had none. By the sacred custom of\nour tribe, which is a very ancient one, he was bound to hold my welfare\neven dearer than his own. When the eldest son of the Chief is born, and\nold enough to shape his lips, he is sent round to the nursing mothers of\nthe tribe to suckle. Whatever babe is placed with him at one breast, he\nat the other, thenceforth their lives are more than twin--for twins may\noften fall out and fight, as did myself and Marva, but never those\nmilk-brothers. Stepan's mother was the first to whom I paid my duty in\nthat tender way, and Stepan's arms were twined in mine; and nothing\ncould sever our hearts thenceforth from the allegiance of boy twins.\n\n\"As I would not enter the inner chambers, where I had been so happy,\nStepan led me to the bath, and fetched another suit of travelling\nclothes, and everything I wanted, not forgetting a trusty sword and a\npair of heavy pistols. Then we had breakfast, and set forth without a\nword to Marva. My children even I durst not ask for, fearing to hear\nthat their mother had carried them into my dishonour.\n\n\"But luckily my good horse _Ardon_, who had borne me through many\nadventures, had been left at home when I last set forth, and was\nneighing for me in the road below, for none but a mule or mountain-pony\ncould clamber up the steep access. Our vehicles also we kept below,\nusing hand-litters to the gates of Karthlos, for ladies or feeble\ntravellers. And thus we three set forth on horseback, with provisions\nfor three days--myself, and Stepan, and the other trooper who had\nreturned with me from Guinib, a faithful and brave fellow who is with me\nnow, named Usnik. Others would have joined us in the valley, but I would\nnot have them. Enough of disgrace already.\n\n\"The roads, or tracks as you would call them, bad enough at any time,\nwere now at many places blocked by heavy and windy snowfalls; for the\nseason was come to the middle of October, and winter had set in early.\nAny one who sees not much of such things, and might be in a mood to\nconsider them, would have found no small delight in the grandeur of the\nworld around. But all that I could think of was the bitterness and\nbaseness of the human race that breathed therein; and when we had passed\nthe post-house (where I kept my troika for long journeys) and learned\nthat the Princess had taken my carriage three days ago, when the weather\nwas fair, and ordered the driver to proceed with all possible haste to\nPatigorsk, my last hope fell, and before me rose only the fury of\nrevenge, and then the despair of a desert life.\n\n\"To that town, whose name was now poison to me, where dissolute Russians\ncame to revel, and vile Circassians to sell their daughters, the journey\nfrom Karthlos in the best of weather was a matter of three days; and now\nwith the road so cumbered, and the buffet of thick snowstorms often\ndashing in our faces, it seemed as if a week was likely still to find us\nstruggling vainly. But about noontide of the second day, being on the\nnorthern fall of mountains, and within the boundaries of Ossetland, we\ncame to a fork of the torrent channel which here served for a roadway,\nand we knew not whether to go right or left. As for any guidance the\nchance was small, one traveller in a winter week was enough for such a\nroad as that. The harvesting of the tissue-grass between the crags was\nover; the neatherd, the shepherd, and the goatherd had long driven home\ntheir charges. We knew not what to do, until one of us espied a little\ndrift of smoke among the pine-trees on the ridge, and I sent the hardy\nUsnik on foot in that direction, while we rested the horses and awaited\nhis return. By this time the wind had dropped a little, but a white\nvapour rolled in and out the crags and forest, as if a giant lay\nsnorting among them, and the air felt like the breath of death. Stepan\nstrode up and down, when he had tied the horses, slapping his bosom to\nkeep himself warm; but I sat upon a rock, and cast my eyes upon the\nground. I was thinking of what I had heard from an Englishman, who had\nbeen our guest at Karthlos. He had told me of the savage gaze of Prince\nRakhan, at my then beloved wife, when he met her at our summer-feast of\nroses, when I had been called away from home.\n\n\"'Why, who comes here on this evil travelling day?' cried Stepan,\nturning suddenly. 'My lord will have company, I think; but not of the\nkind he delights in.'\n\n\"His dark look showed me that there was something to be met, and,\nleaping to my feet, I beheld a company of horsemen advancing towards us\nby the road upon our left. They broke through the drifts by twos and\nthrees, which was all that the track in its widest parts admitted; but\nthe one who rode first rode singly, and he was a big man, stern and\nswarthy. The slope they were descending showed us a score of men,\nwell-armed, behind him.\n\n\"'Behold they are too many for us! Let us fly up the other road.' Stepan\nloosed the horses as he spoke. 'They will kill my lord, and then where\nis our revenge?'\n\n\"'What matters my life to me? Whoever they are, I will not fly. But why\nshould they desire to kill us, Stepan? They look not like bandits; and\nthey are not Russians.'\n\n\"'Nay, but they are worse than either. They are Ossets of the Karai\nKhokh, who go either side of the mountains. Their Chief is dead, and\nthey are Rakhan's children now. Rakhan rides first in this handful.'\n\n\"'Rakhan shall have speech with me,' I spoke, with the heart of my\nspirit rising, as the Lord has granted it to rise when He has beaten\ndown the body. 'Rakhan is welcome! I will salute him.'\n\n\"The man had been out of my sight so long (not only because of my\nservice with Shamyl, but through his own avoidance of me) that I did not\nknow his face for certain till I met his eyes. Then I felt sure what my\nduty was; as God himself ordained it, when He made man to be true to\nwoman, and woman true to man, and their children to spring of their own\nloins,--there was no choice left me but to slay this man, or be slain by\nhim.\n\n\"Having this within my mind, and being calmer than I can be now in\nlooking back upon it, I stood across the narrow track, and took the\nhorse that Rakhan rode by the head, and gazed at Rakhan. He was amazed\nat first, and the colour of his great black eyes turned paler, and he\nfumbled for a pistol, without daring to take his gaze from mine. I would\nnot speak, but I struck his hand up with a flip of mine. The lips that\nhad sullied my dear wife's should have no sort of speech with mine. He\ntried to regard me humorously, as a man who thinks woman his slave\nblinks eye, when the question is about her; but the sparkle of his gaze\ndied under mine, like an ember with the sun on it.\n\n\"'Get off thy horse, Prince Rakhan,' Stepan shouted, with his big arm\nlaid across. 'The time hath come for man to man, instead of lying with\nanother man's wife.'\n\n\"Rakhan made pretence to smile, and to leap from horseback lightly.\n'What a stir to make about a light-of-love! Fool that knows not what a\nwoman is! Stand back, my sons; this is not for you.'\n\n\"The Ossets took their orders gladly. Every savage man loves to see a\nfight. They leaped from their horses, and squatted in the snow, and\nfilled their pipes, and kindled them.\n\n\"There was a clear place close at hand, with a ring of black cedars\nround it, and room inside for stepping to and fro, if life and death\nrequired it. I threw off my furs, and so did he; and we stood against\none another.\n\n\"'Hold! Is this what you call fair duel? His sword is three inches\nlonger than mine,' Rakhan shouted, and I saw that it was just, although\nI had not dreamed of it. I threw away my blade, and took Stepan's,--a\ncommon short weapon, stout and broad.\n\n\"'One thing before I slay thee, Imar,' said Rakhan, with his bright\nGenoese on guard; and I saw that my sword was as nothing to his. 'Young\nman it was I who slew thy father; and now, by the same hand, thou shalt\ndie.'\n\n\"Before the words were finished, he advanced upon me, taking the\ncoward's advantage, as he hoped, of striking me when stricken with that\nshock. But I just drew back for a moment; and then, when he made sure\nthat he had me, and the point of his weapon flashed into my breast, up\nflew his steel, like the sparks of a flint, and my short strong blade\nrushed through his heart. He gave me one glare, and he lay between my\nfeet, with a gurgle of blood spouting out upon the snow.\n\n\"'Go home to the Devil that made thee,' I said, 'and commit adultery if\nthou canst, in hell!'\n\n\"Then Stepan drew the lids upon those toadstool eyes, and gazed at me\nwith terror; for there are times when the God that made us takes us out\nof His own knowledge with the passions Himself has placed in us. Stepan\nthought that I would have slain him too, for doing this ministry to the\ndead; but he did not understand me. I was quiet as a lamb, and would not\nhave resisted if any one had seized that bloody sword and driven it\nthrough my own heart too.\n\n\"'Is there any one among you men,' I asked, coming out into the road\nbefore them,--'any milk-brother of Prince Rakhan, who feels a desire to\nencounter me? I am weary now, and he will have fine chance. Or he can\nshoot at me, if he likes.' But they smoked their pipes, and hugged their\nknees together, and glanced at their horses, as if they loved their\nbacks. How different it would have been with my own tribe!\n\n\"In this stir I was forgetting about Usnik and his message. 'The first\nhalf is finished. Now for the second!' I shouted to Stepan from\n_Ardon's_ back, as I spurred him up the track by which the Ossets had\ndescended. 'This must be the way to the Princess Oria.' For what else\ncould I suppose after meeting Rakhan there?\n\n\"But the Ossets, who were departing by the road which had brought us\nhither, said something to Stepan, and he fetched me back, and pointed to\nthe track upon our right hand. At the same time Usnik returned from the\nfire in the wood, and the result of his inquiry agreed with what\nRakhan's retainers had declared. Patigorsk could be reached by either\nroad; but the one on the left was blocked for wheels, and would soon be\nclosed to horses. If I wished to follow the course of the troika, the\nroad on the right was the one to choose. Moreover, at about three hours'\ndistance, it passed a summer-house, or hunting-lodge, belonging to the\nOsset Chief, but at this time of year unoccupied, where, if we could get\nno further, as appeared too likely already, we could shelter our horses\nfor the night, and kindle fire for ourselves. Patigorsk was the place I\nwanted, and I took what seemed to be the best road to it.\n\n\"As we three set forth again, with our horses looking considerate,--for\nthese are better endowed than we are with knowledge both of sky and\nground,--a little toss of white softness met us, harbouring into our\neyes and beards. The ears and forelocks of our horses pricked themselves\nwith a glittering fringe; and then their manes were like a fountain, and\nthe bow of the saddle became an arch. Presently we could see nothing at\nall, but left it to them to find the way, which they did without any\ncomplaint, not even making a merit of obedience. I let the bridle fall,\nand wished that I could only submit to God, as these good creatures do\nour will, and never even seek for thanks.\n\n\"We went on thus, with the snow-cloud thickening, and black rocks or a\nbough of pine jumping out of the white against us, when suddenly my\nhorse pulled up, and his chin was striking something. He seemed to know\nit, and so did I. It was the black rail of my troika, in which we had\nenjoyed so many a summer jaunt, in the days when my Oria loved me. The\ncarriage was standing in the middle of the road, but there was no Oria\nin it, neither any other human being, nor even a horse in front of it.\nThe cushions were gone: the contents were snow.\n\n\"'Her Highness must be close at hand,' cried Stepan, leaning over it,\n'and yonder is Rakhan's pleasure-lodge. God grant that the wolves have\nnot gotten her!'\n\n\"'One wolf hath had her; but he will no more;' I answered, with my heart\non fire through all the snow that froze my breast. 'Thou, and Usnik,\nhold the horses; I will see to this myself.'\n\n\"Then I stamped on the road, and shook the snow off, and saw that it was\nred with my own blood where the dead man's sword had touched me; and\nfollowing the shelter of some trees, where the streaks of the storm went\nby me, I stood at the door of a house built of logs, with plaster\nslabbed between them. Thrice I knocked with the hilt of my sword,\nwithout drawing it from the scabbard, while I felt that the crisis of my\nlife was come--the time that comes only once, thank God, in His\ncreature's three score years and ten.\n\n\"'How soon thou art back! How glad I am! This is so kind and faithful of\nthee.' It was Oria's voice, and I ground my teeth. She expected her new\nlove, Rakhan.\n\n\"Then she drew back the bolt, and stood before me, glittering in all her\nperfect beauty, but pale as a ghost at this surprise. 'My lord!' she\ngasped, for she was always timid; and I said, 'Yes, thy proper lord.'\n\n\"Her hand went to her heart, as if it were failing her in this\namazement, and she spread the other arm to me; but I drew back and gazed\nat her. 'Never touch me more,' I said; and her soft eyes fell before the\nflash of mine.\n\n\"'What have I done to enrage thee, Imar? Thou hast never spoken to me\nlike this? I have left thy roof. But how could I help it? I have done\nwhat women may not do. But it was only for thy sake--and oh, my lord is\nwounded!'\n\n\"'Yes, through thee. But what is that?' I stretched my scabbarded sword\nacross, as she with a rush of tears approached. 'Thy paramour lies dead\nfor this. And what art thou? Liar, adulteress, Zanska.'\n\n\"That last is the lowest word that can be used to any woman. She gazed\nat me for a moment with a look that will never leave me, and then in a\nlow clear voice she said,--\n\n\"'It is enough. No woman of my race must hear that name from her lord,\nand live.'\n\n\"She bowed her head, as if receiving the sentence of death submissively,\nand then walked slowly towards the inner room. At the door she turned,\nand waved her hand with a proud and calm farewell to me. I knew what it\nmeant, and sprang towards her, but my scabbard struck the door-post, my\nfeet were cased in ice and snow, and I fell on my back in the outer\nroom, as a flash came from the inner.\n\n[Illustration: \"_At the door she turned with a proud and calm farewell\nto me._\"]\n\n\"'Help, help! My lord will bleed to death! Lady Oria! Baboushka!' The\nvoice was not Stepan's, but Kobaduk's; and I felt my boiling blood run\ncold.\n\n'What dost thou here? What have I done?' I shouted, rising clumsily, for\nmy wound had burst forth through the fall. 'Old man, thy mistress hath\nshot herself. What dost thou in Rakhan's service?'\n\n\"'Nought have I to do with Rakhan. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar knows not what he saith.\nBaboushka and I have been with the lady, all the way from Karthlos, till\nI went to yon village for food for us.'\n\n\"I fell against the wall, and stared at him. Then Stepan stood also in\nthe doorway, and his voice was like the moan of death.\n\n\"'It is true, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar. The troika hath broken down at this gate. The\nPrincess Oria hath never seen Rakhan; neither came she to see him.'\n\n\"I laughed, I shouted, as at some fine joke. 'I see, I see my sweet\nmistake. He came not from her; he came to seek her. Ah, but he met the\nwrong one; the wrong one it was, and yet the right.'\n\n\"What matter what I did or said? Henceforth in all my life, what\nmatters? And when it is over, can I be saved? If so, it will be for\nOria's sake. Thank God that she knew before she died, slain by the\nweapon which she had brought to protect her honour,--and Rakhan would\nhave tasted cold lead, I trow, if his miscreant scheme had entrapped\nher,--by the mercy of God, she knew in that short hour the hellish fraud\nwhich slew her.\n\n\"The bullet had not touched her heart, and she passed away as a flower\nfades, drooping from some inward harm. My pistols were left in my\nholsters, but I loaded Oria's again, that I might not be slow to follow\nher, the moment she could not see it done. But she opened her eyes for\nthe last time, when they seemed to have lost all sight of earth, and she\ntried to lay her hand on mine, with deep love looking back upon me\nthrough the cloud of Death.\n\n\"'For Orry's sake, for babe's, for _mine_,' she whispered with her\nlatest breath.\n\n\"I pledged my word; but how often was it almost beyond my power to keep!\nAnd one of my pledges was lost already; when I got home--to my desolate\nand wretched home--there was only my baby Dariel left, to link me to\nthis altered world. Marva was gone back to her Osset tower, and it\nseemed better so; for I had brought her husband's lying letter, handed\nme by Kobaduk, and purporting to come from her. To wit, an urgent\nsummons for my wife to fly to my bedside and nurse me through a\ndangerous wound at Patigorsk. This letter I meant to place on Marva's\nlap, and ask if she were privy to it. I hope not, I pray not; for it\nwould be almost too black-hearted, too treacherous for the worst woman's\nrevenge. I hope she believed that Oria, whom she always hated, had left\nhome through her own desire, to meet Rakhan in that festive town. For a\nwoman has not strong faith always in the virtue of other women. To her\nown faith she will be true; but she doubts about theirs too shrewdly.\nWomen of the common sort, I mean. My Oria was too sweet for that.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nIMAR'S TALE--EXILE\n\n\n\"You understand from what I said, that my only son was gone as well, the\neldest born of our fervent love, to whom with a pleasant conceit I had\ngiven the name of 'Origen,'--born of Oria. The other was named from the\nplace of her own birth, arriving unexpectedly, when we went in the\ntroika to see the great post-house just built by the Russians on their\ngrand new road, which cuts the great mountain-chain beneath the towering\npeak of Kazbek.\n\n\"Unnatural it may seem, and sluggish, and even an abject thing to those\nwho have never lost their courage; but when I was carried up the steps\nof Karthlos, with the body of my wife on the other litter, and the\ncarpenter ordered to remember my length in the boards he was cutting out\nfor her,--for we are a thrifty race, holding fast the hide when we have\nlost the horns,--and I managed to say at my own threshold--'Let me see\nmy babies'; behold there was only one brought to me, and she could not\nwalk, nor say 'Dadda,' as babies of every language do.\n\n\"Nevertheless, without excuse, she took my liking as of right, lying so,\nand smiling at me with the faith of baby eyes, and the beginning of a\nclever nose, and pink lips parted like a berry, as if I had a breast for\nher.\n\n\"'Sweetie, it is thy father, not thy mother,' the woman who bore her\nsaid, 'and if he hath no breast for thee, his heart shall be all the\nnigher. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, this is all the Lord hath left thee for thy home and\nheart. Gather thy life up, for her sake.'\n\n\"I saw the likeness of her mother in her, and she came into my helpless\narms, and laid her soft face in my beard, and played with the bandage\nround my wound. And they say that she spoke her first word thus; but\nwomen must not be trusted, when their imaginations move them.\n\n\"As soon as I was able to think more clearly, I asked for my boy,\nOrigen. They told me, as soon as they thought it safe, that on the\nsecond day after my departure, the very day of my fatal deeds, the poor\nlittle fellow, scarce three years old, was killed through his own high\ncourage. My sister, who reigned in the Castle now, had given orders that\nhe should be kept apart from her own child Hafer, and in the top rooms,\nwhere the nursery was with a separate staircase to it. Perhaps she\ndesired that even in childhood there should be no acquaintance between\nthe offspring of Oria and her own. But my little Orry was as strong and\nactive as an average child of twice his years, and he could not endure\nto be cooped up thus. He contrived to get out of a loop-hole, and thence\nto the head of the outer staircase, and so upon the table-cliff behind\nthe house, where he ran frolicking among the snow. This rock is\nperpendicular upon all its southern face, and the dumb child Hafer,\nseeing Orry's delight, ran out to share it from a lower door, while his\nmother was away upon some business, with only two trusty servants.\n\n\"Soon one of our women heard my boy shouting, and laughing at the other\nchild who could not shout; and instead of tempting them in with a\nsweetmeat, the thoughtless girl ran after them. Of course they ran away,\nand before she could catch them, both vanished over the brink of the\ncliff, where a crest of snow obscured it; and verily she was afraid to\ngo back to the house, and tell what she had done. She concealed herself\nbehind the corner, and left others to find out the loss. But it was not\nvery long unknown, for Marva was coming along the ravine upon her return\nto Karthlos, in the teleka which had brought her first, and which she\nkept at the posting-house. She saw the two children lying there after\ntheir fall of two hundred feet, her own child unhurt in a pile of snow,\nand my little darling on the rocky floor, with his poor head dashed to\npieces.\n\n\"For her bitter turn against me, I forgave her, when I heard of her\ntenderness to my poor child. It is at such times that the greatness of\na woman's nature shows itself. Happily she knew not as yet of my\nencounter with her husband, which must have been taking place just then,\nbut forgetting all her grievances against me she took both little ones\ninto her carriage, and drove at all speed to the posting-house. There\nshe ordered a private room, and allowed no one to come near them, except\nher own Baboushka, while she sent to a village five miles off for the\nonly doctor to be heard of. He came as soon as he could, but she had\nabandoned all hope by that time, as any but a woman must have done long\nsince, and there was no one to receive him. For Marva had sent her own\nchild home in dread of the effect upon his little brain, and at night\nshe appeared at the gate of Karthlos, with the baby heir cold as a stone\nin her arms. His pretty red cross, and his green velvet dress, and above\nall the billows of his golden hair still flowing from the linen swathes\nof Death--when the women saw these they bewailed the child of Imar and\nof Oria, almost as if they had lost their own. Before my return, he was\nburied in our little churchyard of the glen; and his mother lies beside\nhim.\n\n\"I have told you a melancholy tale; but when the Lord has tried one\nchild beyond His other children, and almost beyond the strength\nvouchsafed to the best of them to bear it, something good shall be yet\nin store; and happiness may spring up again, though pleasure be but a\nmemory. And the soul that has passed through rough affliction and the\nlong cold shadow, is led more kindly into the paths of shelter, and\ncontent with quietude.\n\n\"I have done enough of harm, my friend. I have broken up two households;\nI have wasted half my tribe in war, and slain a good few Russians. These\nyou may slay by the thousand, without checking the supply of them; you\nare only guilty of their blood, and the tears of those who loved them.\nBut my own losses taught me what it is to make others desolate. And the\nrest of my life, please God, shall go to redeem the wrongs of wrath and\nwar.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nSANGUINE STILL\n\n\nWhen the Prince Imar's tale was told, and I thought of all he had been\nthrough, I could not find it in my heart, or even in good manners, to\ncrave explanation of certain points which had not been made quite clear\nto me. For any such inquiry might appear to proceed from a hankering to\nhear more about his darling daughter. He had enjoyed, beyond our chance,\na quantity of romantic love; and though he might not be hard on mine,\nremembering his own tender time, and allowing for like state in others,\non the other hand that lesson might have taught him how to look at this,\nbefore it went too far to stop. And it is not in the gift of men, or at\nleast of such as I am, to be certain how a brother man may take what\nseems so clear to self. But while I was buried in these thoughts, he\nspoke again quite cheerfully, and as if he had understood them all, but\nwould not blame me for them.\n\n\"From what I have said, you will perceive that I have now two things to\nthink of. The first, and dearest, is my own child, the daughter of the\nblameless wife, whom I lost through my own madness. The other is my duty\ntowards the people who have been so true to me; who can be raised by one\nwho knows them, to a better and more peaceful life, and the first\ncondition of happiness the rule of Christianity. We have had the name\nfor ages; but we have never known the meaning; of which you too must\nwait to learn till sorrow has washed the eyes of pride.\n\n\"That vile blood-feud, the curse of the mountains, the cause of a myriad\nmurders, could not exist if we were more than mere ticket-porters of the\ncross. Therefore I am doing my best, without aid of your good societies,\nwhich would get into trouble with Russia at once, to print 10,000\ncopies of the New Testament, in the Lesghian tongue. In a short time now\nmy period of exile, fourteen years, will expire; and the rest of my life\nwill be given up to the spread of good-will amongst us. Thus alone can I\nhope to have done some good to balance my evil deeds. But the difficulty\nof the thing is this. Not a man in a hundred of us can read, and perhaps\nnot a woman of all the race. To meet this I am preparing primers,\nhorn-books, alphabets, all the rudiments; and I shall set up a school in\nevery village. It is too much for one short life, but at least I can\nbegin it, and when once begun, it will go on, for the Russians will not\nstop me. The Russians have been very good to me, and they hate the rule\nof Islam, which is warlike and implacable. The Commander of the Caucasus\nis a man of great humanity. If he could have done as he liked, I should\nhave received at once a free pardon; and as it is, my revenues have\nnever been confiscated. He knows that I would be the last to attempt or\njoin in another insurrection. There never was a chance, since time\nbegan, of a great Caucasian nation. We are split into about seventy\ntribes, and each loathes all the others. Young as I was, when I joined\nShamyl, the folly of it was clear to me; and my father perished not by a\nforeign but a neighbour's hand, as usual. That may be my fate also,\nespecially when I attempt reforms. But if so, I shall have done my best\nto redeem a life of violence.\"\n\nAs I looked at him, I could wonder no more that Dariel thought so little\nof all other men compared with him. Here was a man, one might well\nbelieve, who never knew what fear was, suspicion, falsehood, meanness,\nenvy, or even the love of money. It had been the sense of justice only,\nand no greed or jealousy, which had led him to reject the demand of\nRakhan, his father's murderer; whence all the disasters of his life\nensued. And it seemed to me that if ever there had lived a man of honour\nand kind heart, who deserved the favour of Heaven and the reverence of\nhis fellows, it was this man long oppressed by some mysterious curse of\ndestiny.\n\nMy voice was trembling with something more than regard for my own\ninterests, when I fetched him back from his great ideas, which were\never so far above my scope, to the matter which concerned me most.\n\n\"S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, I am quite small of mind, and would rather receive than do\ngood things. And of all the blessings of the blessed world, you know the\none that I value most.\" He smiled a little, for his face was always\nready to yield to gentle turns.\n\n\"My friend, I know what your desire is. You want to rob me of my one\ndelight. But I feel myself safe for a long while yet. I rely upon many\nobstacles. In the first place, will your own discretion and judgment\nbear you out in wishing, even if you had my consent, to connect yourself\nwith a race of such dark fortunes and sad calamities, and crimes as\nwell--for crimes they are? And perhaps there are more before us. I have\ntold you my tale, to show you this. I believe not of course in any\nheathen conceptions--At\u00c3\u00a9, Nemesis, Ananch\u00c3\u00a9, or what not? But who can\ndeny that there is an inheritance of evil quite beyond our power to\nexplain?\"\n\n\"That may be so. But my one prayer is to be allowed to risk such\npenalty.\"\n\n\"You speak like an Englishman,\" he answered, looking at me very gravely;\n\"other men equally brave would decline, through the force of\nsuperstition. But I have only begun my objections yet. For instance,\nwhat would your own friends have to say about this question? You have\nnot mentioned it yet, I suppose, as nothing was likely to come of it.\nBut without that, you must know pretty nearly how your friends would\ntake it.\"\n\nI answered in so many words that they left me to follow my own judgment\nnow; that while things continued as they were, it would be wrong of me\nto forsake them, as they could never get on without me; but that a\nchange for the better might be expected now with all confidence, for\nEngland was sick of that farce so ridiculously called \"free-trade,\" and\nthen the land might feed her sons again, instead of giving them nothing\nbut a weedy grave.\n\n\"It is the standing joke of Europe,\" he replied; \"there is nothing to\ncompare with it in history. Your benevolence is of the highest order,\nbecause so purely unconscious. But it will require another generation to\nrestore your sanity, unless you have a war that blocks your supplies;\nand then how simple! That man who can fast for forty days may challenge\nthe nation, when war is declared, and outlive them all, though they eat\nall they can get. But let me not interrupt you.\"\n\nWhat is the loaf compared to love? The dealers and the middlemen have\nthe chief pull of the former. Turn me into a Radical, if the labourer\ngets an ounce the more for his fourpence, than he often did of old, when\nhis right hand stood him in good stead, and his Saturday night was\ncertain. But a foreigner is allowed to show the common-sense, which an\nEnglishman is hooted down for hinting.\n\n\"We shall never be as we were,\" I said, \"we shall always be poor, S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar. And I am only a younger son. If it is your duty to repel me for\nthat reason, I have nothing more to say.\"\n\n\"We will not part like this,\" he answered, feigning, as every man should\ndo, to be blind when another man is moved; \"there are many things in\nyour way, my friend; but I will not make the worst of them. You have my\nrespect and liking, which I do not give to every one. But in spite of\nall I have gone through or perhaps by reason of it, I have some romance\nabout me still. You say that you love my daughter, and I thoroughly\nbelieve it. But does she love you?\"\n\n\"I have no reason to think so yet. What right have I to hope for it? She\nis far above me in every way. But if you do not forbid me--why I could\ntry--I could try my best, you know.\"\n\nIt was almost more than he could do to look with becoming gravity at the\nsadly waning phase of hope depicted on my countenance. He smiled,\nbecause he could not help it. And I smiled, to keep time with him.\n\n\"You are honest, at any rate,\" he said, \"and that you have been from\nfirst to last. Of English modes of wooing, I know nothing; and they are\nnot like ours. But this strikes me as an unusual thing; though perhaps\nall you ask is what you would call 'a fair field and no favour.' You\nshall have it, as far as I am concerned; though I will not pledge myself\nafterwards. But remember that in a month or so, we return to our native\nmountains.\"\n\nThis was awful news to me; and I seemed to have no fair chance left.\nMoreover I felt very deep alarm concerning that Prince Hafer, Dariel's\ncousin, about whom I had heard so much, and of whom I had seen too much\nalready. Was he the son of that terrible woman, Marva--S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's\nsister--and that hateful man, and horrible plotter, Rakhan, Prince of\nthe Ossets? I had longed to ask his Uncle Imar for more particulars,\nabout him, and especially what he was doing here, but my courage had\nfailed me on that point. Alas that he was no longer dumb; and if he had\nfallen 200 feet in his childhood, no wonder that he could jump 10 now;\nfor Nature always strives towards a balance. And if he could not jump 10\nfeet in height (which perhaps is more than any man even of the mountains\nhas achieved), it was plain enough that he would prove a very awkward\ncustomer, whenever my sense of the gross injustice inflicted by his\npresence should urge me to attempt by hand or foot his desirable\nremoval. But one thing I might ask, as I thought, without showing any\nimpertinence, or reviving painful memories.\n\n\"Your sister, the Princess Marva, sir? I hope she continued to show\ngood-will, and afforded you some comfort before you were banished from\nDaghestan. She herself remains there, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Not in Daghestan, but in Ossetia, which lies to the west of the great\nRussian road that marks the division of the Mountain-range. No, I cannot\nsay that she showed any sisterly feeling towards me, except the true\nsorrow for my child of which I spoke; and perhaps no woman who witnessed\na scene of such distress could have helped being touched. But when I\nheard of her tender behaviour, and remembered that old scruples were\npartly removed by the death of the offender, I sent her all that she\ncould claim, and much more, of her inheritance in goods and chattels.\nBut it is impossible for her, as long as she continues Rakhan's widow,\nto show much affection for me, though I may hope that she has it in her\nheart. For unhappily that most fiendish and accursed institution, which\nI hope to begin to extirpate, by the spread of the Gospel and of\neducation--the blood-feud is set up between us. By marriage she is an\nOsset, and among the Ossets she holds sway, like a petty Queen almost.\nAlthough she cannot have any vindictive feelings against me, after all\nher husband's behaviour to both of us, she must respect their customs,\nand not show herself too friendly. Therefore I take it as unusually kind\nand good on her part, that knowing how soon my time expires, she has\nsent her only son, Prince Hafer, to congratulate me, and to offer an\nancient residence or Court-house of the Ossets, which stands very\nconveniently, for us to occupy on our return, till Karthlos (which is in\na sad condition) can be put into good repair. That I call a true\nextension of the olive-branch; and it is the more remarkable to one who\nknows as I do that this infernal code, for I can call it nothing else,\nis supposed to be doubly binding when it inures betwixt near relatives.\nBlessed are they that never heard of it. No flight of time, no acts of\nkindness, no natural affections avail against it.\"\n\n\"It is horrible indeed,\" I said, \"and nothing can be more un-English. We\nare the most sensible race in the world, as well as the most\nstraightforward. 'Have it out and be done with it,' is our rule; no\nsteel, no lead, no poison; but a fight with what the Lord has made.\"\n\n\"You also have your brutality, I fear. But it is not my place to talk of\nthat, after all the kindness I have received among you. And you are wide\nawake to all your own virtues, so that I need not insist upon them. Is\nthere anything more you would ask me?\"\n\n\"Nothing, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar. And I may have seemed to trespass already on your\npatience. But I have a brother who is wonderfully clever in all\nmechanical and chemical affairs. May I bring him to see your\ntype-stamping process, and other beautiful devices? They are out of my\nline altogether; but he would appreciate all of them. And more than that\nhe is gifted, as you are, with the faculty of languages. He is the\ngenius, and I the dunce. May he come? He has nothing to do with the\nPress, and will not even talk of what he sees.\"\n\n\"It will give me great pleasure to see such a man;\" my host replied most\ncourteously. \"There is no secrecy about my work, beyond this--if your\njournals spoke of it--and they speak of even smaller matters--it might\nget into some Russian paper, and my little ideas would be quenched at\nonce. Russia does not encourage education, outside her own narrow\ngrooves. But if I could only begin unforbidden, probably I might go on\nfor years. You see how sanguine I am still.\"\n\n\"And your nephew will be of great service, no doubt, as his mother is so\nfriendly. In his early days he had no power of speech I think you told\nme. But that comes sometimes rather late in life.\"\n\n\"I do not think that I spoke about it; because I had no knowledge. His\nfather mentioned it in that fatal letter. But before I left the\nmountains I was told that an operation at Tiflis had relieved the child\nof the tongue-tie; and now he seems to be in many ways a fine specimen\nof the Caucasus. He cannot speak your language well, though he has\npicked up a little of it, and he is not very fond of your nation. But if\nyour brother is a linguist, possibly he might get on with him. And I\nshould like to try the experiment. When will you bring your brother? But\ntell him not the story of my life, as I have told it to you. It is a\nthing I never speak of, without a special reason.\"\n\n\"You may depend upon me, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar; I know the favour you have done me,\nand the reason for it. There are few who would have gone through so much\npain, for the sake of almost a stranger. But I know not when I can bring\nHarold. He is a most uncertain fellow. Nobody can ever tell where to\nfind him. He says it is the beauty of his character. But I hope that I\nmay come before he does; or it will be a bad look-out for me.\"\n\n\"You may come to see me every day, my friend, and I shall be pleased to\nsee you. But if you meet Hafer, be on your guard. He has the rough\nmanners of the mountains still, and has not seen the world, as I have.\"\n\nThus I was obliged to leave it. Not at all to my liking; yet with no\nright to complain of any one. This Lesghian Chief had laid me under a\nvery great obligation, by overcoming for my sake his natural reluctance\nto recall a past so full of pain, and in such bitter contrast with the\npresent conditions of his life. As a nation we make little of the debt\nwhich a foreigner incurs to the hospitality of England. The guest,\nmoreover, is too graceful ever to inflict on us the pain of seeing him\noverwhelmed with gratitude. But this Lesghian Chief had formed what was\nperhaps a romantic view of the greatness of our policy, and a liking for\nus which is, I fear, by no means universal. This I hoped to work with\ndiligence for my own advantage; as our Government used to do, as long as\nit still subsisted.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nLARGE AND LONG VIEWS\n\n\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had spoken of happiness as resembling a mountain-eagle in the\nbrevity of its visits, and the speed of its flight away from us, rather\nthan the gentle dove whose nest is always near our roof, while the\ncooing of her soft content pervades the summer evening. And probably he\nwas right enough as regards his own race and country, where all is\nrugged, strong, and fierce, and a pious life too often means pure\nimpotence for robbery.\n\nBut if he only could have seen my father of a sunny morning, sitting in\nhis little room, with the red cloth on the table, and the drawers of his\ncabinet pulled out, and his choicest coins laid gingerly with their\nfaces tilted towards the light, and a chamois leather, and a box of\npowder, and a tiny bottle of acid to be used most sparingly--that Chief\nof great stature, and still greater mind, would have perceived that\nbliss may come with the downy plume of the dove, as well as the swoop of\nthe eagle's pinion. For here was an ancient gentleman, who had never\nknown flash and clash of steel, or the rush of hot blood upon frozen\nsnow; but had only been damaged by the rapid fall of grain, and no\nlonger had the spirit to cry out at that; yet in the evening of his days\nfound pleasure in the coinage of the past, when the currency failed so\npainfully. Often he shouted for his wife or daughter, to share some\ngreat discovery, some new interpretation of his magnifying glass, or the\nlens of imagination, over some battered disc, resembling the plate which\nour blacksmith clamps red-hot on the nose of a vainly squealing porker.\n\nThen was Sir Harold's pleasure at the acme and the apex. What delight is\nperfect without something to find fault with? And the fonder one is of\nthe poor short-comer, the sweeter it becomes to correct the loose idea.\n\n\"This indeed is frightful, my dear Grace! Will you never know an old L\nfrom a T? And how often must I tell you, that they run the other way?\nThere's a tangle of your hair coming in the light again! If you want to\nbe of any use, which you never can be, do go and cut off at least three\nquarters of it. One would think that girls were made of nothing else but\nhair. Show me any mops and frizzles, on a feminine obverse. Look at this\nfascia! I'll get you one to-morrow. You fetch it round tightly, and then\nyou cut off all the rest. Unless you like to bunch it, as a jockey does\na horse, I shall speak to your mother about it. Nothing shall be done\nthat you dislike. But you see for yourself how becoming it is?\"\n\n\"Lovely, oh, lovely! I am wild about it, father. But the lady has no\nnose. Is mine to come off too?\"\n\n\"She has had a nose, and as good a one as yours. It is the mere accident\nof attrition. But here comes George! What can George want now? He knows\nthat I never should be interrupted, with all these drawers open. If any\nrival Numismatist--I am sorry to say there is no honesty among them.\nEven the people at the British Museum, when I lent them for comparison,\nkept back three most valuable--the gems, the gems of my whole\ncollection!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I don't blame them. It was for the instruction of the\nnation.\" I knew that my father was even more proud than indignant at\nthis fact--if fact it was, and he had long ago made it one, by telling\nit at least twice a-day. \"But I don't want to disturb you, sir, and I\ndon't often do it. Only there are two things that I am bound to consult\nyou about immediately, if you can spare me a few minutes, without having\nto put more important work aside.\"\n\nMy father sighed; for he hated business, as he had good cause to do,\nwhile Grace walked away with a lofty air, like a lady denied the\nfranchise. Finding myself rather nervous, I began in a craven manner\nwith other people's business.\n\n\"Bandilow wants to know, sir, whether he may break up half-moon meadow,\nand plant it with apple- and pear-trees. He says it is the only chance\nof his being able to pay his rent, next Lady day.\"\n\n\"But, my dear George,\" Sir Harold replied, while he spread a silk\nhandkerchief over his coins, lest the atmosphere of business should\ncorrode them, \"does the silly fellow expect to realise a fruit-crop\nbetwixt this and then?\"\n\n\"Very likely he does, for he has found an apple on a tree he planted not\nmore than two years ago; and the Society for the Promotion of British\nFructiculture has sent him a coloured print of apples bigger than\nturnips and brighter than prize carnations. And you know what Lord\nMelladew did for him; they would not advance him any money,--in fact, he\nhad to subscribe to them,--but for a 'nominal price' they supplied him\nwith a list of fifteen hundred kinds----\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't want to hear any more about that! I should have some faith\nin it, if they put their own money into it, instead of being paid for\npersuading other people to invest in it. However, it is no concern of\nmine.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I think it is. In a sort of sideway, at any rate.\nYou would not like an old tenant, whose family has held under ours for\nat least three centuries, to be robbed by private folly of the little\nthe public mania has left him. I know the climate of Surrey pretty well,\nand there are very few better in England. Last May, the mercury stood\nbelow freezing point at six in the morning, no less than eight times;\nand twice it was eight degrees below. Have we any fruit-bloom that can\nlaugh at that? You would not like an elderly man like Bandilow, with a\nlarge family dependent upon him, to be ruined, would you now? And he is\nalready in arrears of rent?\"\n\n\"Certainly I should grieve at that, and throw him off every farthing,\nlittle as we can afford it. But my dear boy, you make the worst of\nthings, and you are sadly obstinate; which, perhaps, is a family\nfailing. Men of tenfold your knowledge have proved that the only remedy,\nand a very easy one, offered by Providence itself, for the present\nstarvation of agriculture, is to take to horticulture. If wheat will not\npay at 30s. per quarter, fall back upon apples at a pound a bushel. And\nthen there is jam, a glorious scheme.\"\n\nI saw that all reason was in vain. Lord Melladew had got hold of my good\nfather, and tip-top prices upon West-end counters had been quoted for\norchard average. It was useless to say another word. But who ever ceased\non that account?\n\n\"If the wheat crop is precarious, I should like to know what the fruit\ncrop is. Two years in three give a fair crop of grain; scarcely one in\nthree of fruit. If we turned every field into a broom of trees, would\neven the present low prices hold, in the years when there was anything\non them? The fruit might roll on the ground and rot, whenever the season\nwas plentiful. Englishmen cannot live on apples; and jam is only fit for\nchildren. But do as you like, sir. Do as you like.\"\n\n\"George, I am guided too much sometimes by the way in which you look at\nthings. You have formed very strong opinions, and there may be something\nin them. Nothing is more wonderful to me than the difference in\ncharacter betwixt you and Harold. Harold looks at a thing all round, and\nis never quite sure about it. But you make up your mind without looking\nat all, and I defy anybody to move you.\"\n\n\"I have made up my mind, sir, about another matter, which I came to put\nbefore you. And though I am not to be moved from it, I do hope that you\nwill take my view. But is Bandilow to have his way?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" my father answered with a pleasant smile, for he had formed\nthe most erroneous opinions about me; \"is no one to have his way, but my\nson George? It is only fair to let a tenant crop his land as he thinks\nbest, unless he injures it permanently; and especially such a man as\nBandilow, who has stuck to us, when all the others dropped off. And\nthere is another reason. Many of the newspapers, loving, as some of them\nseem to do, to stir up ill-will among Englishmen, keep on declaring that\nthe landlords form the chief obstacle to the improvement of land. The\nthing is absurd. You might just as well say that if you borrow a\nhundred pounds of me, I must long for your bankruptcy, lest you should\nrepay me. What landlord would not be delighted if his tenant could make\n\u00c2\u00a350 an acre, as these people say? I only wish this fruit-craze could\nlast.\"\n\n\"Father, you are right. What a blessing it would be, if they could only\nfetch it round! Let us hope for the best, as they do. And now for the\nother question, all about myself; and I hope you will take the same\nliberal views. But it is a long story. Have your easy chair, and your\nlittle glass of mead that stops the cough. Well, Harold did some good in\nrecommending that. You never get the cough as you used to have it.\"\n\n\"Harold is a very clever fellow,\" my father said, after a sip or two;\n\"if that boy would only stick to something--or if I could make a blend\nof you two--well, well, we can't have everything.\"\n\n\"That is a righteous law for us; but it ought not to apply to you, sir,\nwhose wishes are so moderate. For instance, I want a thing that I shall\nnever get. May I call Mother in, to hear what it is?\"\n\nIn this there was wisdom, gracious wisdom, such as we are inspired with\nsometimes, however foolish we may generally be. For whatever opinion my\nfather might form, he would have my mother looking at him, and then she\nwould be sure to give a glance at me, and the experience of years would\nbe belied unless she gave utterance to a conclusion not directly\ncounter, but sub-contrary, hypenantious--if such a word is\npardonable--to the view which her husband had ventured to form without\nwaiting for her suggestion. For they had grown so much alike, that both\nof them doubted about the joint-stock wisdom; as we all despise\nhome-produce.\n\nSeeing myself in the right way thus, while indulging in all due\ndeference, I did my very best to let them know that I had striven after\nthings above me. My father was ready to concede that point; but my\nmother could not conceive it; and was eager to branch out into a long\ndiscourse, about all the great people akin to us in body, but in mind\nnot as yet awake to it. My father joined me in abbreviating that--though\nat such a time it was hard measure--but he heard the old Grandfather\nClock strike one; and if mother got wound up on that chain, the\nhour-hand might go round the dial before he got any luncheon! Therefore\nhe spoke decisively.\n\n\"What we have heard from George is not altogether what I expected.\nEverybody knows, though he seems to imagine that nobody ever dreamed of\nit, that he had found some attraction among those very strange people\nthat live in the dell. Who they are, or what they do there, it has never\nconcerned me to inquire. When strangers come into a neighbourhood, and\ndesire to keep themselves to themselves, no English gentleman would ever\nthink of obtruding himself upon them. They may be very estimable, and\neven of very high rank in a foreign way, as George supposes. But when\nthey pack themselves up inside a wall, without even a bell, or if they\nhave one with only fierce dogs to answer it, all we can do is to leave\nthem to the Police, or the Government, or the Newspapers. The right of\nasylum is sacred in England. Of Continental intrigues we know nothing,\nand we refuse to be mixed up with them. Even with a Radical Government\nin power--my dear, you quite agree with me?\"\n\n\"In every word that you have said, my dear. But when our George, without\nasking his mother, goes out of his way to make strange acquaintance, and\npeople who pretend to look down upon us----\"\n\n\"You have no right to say that, my dear. We must not think that they are\nso absurd. They have the highest opinion of this Country, as of course\nthey are bound to have, except as to our one great mistake. And there,\nif I understand George aright, Prince--what's his name, Mari? It sounds\nlike New Zealand, but at any rate his views do him very high credit. He\nspoke of Free Trade with very fine contempt; I think you told me so,\nGeorge?\"\n\n\"Sir, he could not find any word strong enough to describe our folly.\nAnd the testimony of an outsider--but you never use such language, sir.\"\n\n\"No, I leave that to younger people, who may live to see the worst of\nit. But this gentleman must have great perception, as well as much\nintegrity. You think that he draws a large revenue, and this young lady\nis his only child.\"\n\n\"My dear, you forget how they live out there,\" said my mother, who was\nabove lucre, and my father as well too superior to show it. \"Who can\ntell how many wives they have? And their laws not too respectable, I am\nhalf afraid, upon such points.\"\n\n\"I was very well up in Geography once,\" my father replied with a smile\nat her, \"I could construe some of Prometheus vinctus, and I have a coin,\nwith the rock and the chain and the vulture, but the Titan has been\neaten to nothing by time. It is extremely valuable; yet the British\nMuseum failed to steal it. That Prince comes from the very same spot. It\nmay have been struck by his ancestors. George says that they come in a\ndirect line from Noah's own great-grandson.\"\n\n\"In that case, indeed, who are we to talk of our own children? Who,\nindeed, are we?\" My mother glanced upward, as if to watch the whole of\ncreation sliding. \"Although to a reasonable mind the Heptarchy is as\nmuch as one requires to be sure of. But I should like to see that girl,\nGeorge.\"\n\n\"Stop,\" said my father, \"I am not a sceptic; Mama, you must not set a\nbad example. I had my little doubts about the Ark, I must confess, until\nso many people attacked it, among them a Bishop of our Church, who\ncontinued to enjoy his income. If he was in earnest, he scarcely could\nbe honest, and in that case, who would listen to him? And if the Ark\nrested upon Ararat, that would be the neighbourhood to know all about\nit. I will not contradict Prince Maori.\"\n\n\"But it is the girl I care about;\" my mother made a great point of the\ntempers of young women. \"George is so peaceable, and he never argues. I\ncannot risk his happiness with a wife who may be descended from--from\neven the females mentioned in the Bible.\"\n\n\"My dear mother, what a hurry you are in. The young lady does not care a\nfig about me yet. And I am very much afraid that she never, never will.\nOnly I thought that I had better let you know.\"\n\n\"This sort of thing has never happened to you before, and that is very\ngreatly to your credit, George.\" My father looked stealthily at my\nmother, lest her conscience should involve her in some misconstruction\nhere. \"But we must talk it over first, your mother and myself. We could\nhave no idea that such a thing was happening on our property, I mean--of\ncourse, what used to be ours. It seems to be departing from the proper\nway so much, and the practice of the family. I am sure there are plenty\nof nice girls round here.\"\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said my mother, rather quickly, and giving\nme a signal to leave the rest to her; \"English girls are not at all as\nthey were in my time. They have dropped all their modest looks and\ndelicacy. They talk slang, and they speak without being introduced, and\nthey call one another Jack and Jemmy, and they let young men give them\npairs of gloves, and they come into a room with both arms swinging; and\nas for their dresses, and the way they do their hair----\"\n\n\"Your opinion upon all these points, dear mother, has influenced me\nbeyond all doubt, even more than I was aware of. But you must remember\nthat Dariel is also of the most ancient English lineage, gone by quite\nas much as you could wish--Crusaders, probably our Richard the first,\nand some of his devoted paladins. What can be nobler than to carry on a\npeaceful crusade of education, literature, Christianity----\"\n\n\"They could never do that without plenty of money,\" said my father, a\nman as free from mercenary views as ever tried to raise a shilling. \"And\nyou spoke of some emerald mines, I think. But we must be careful, very\ncareful, and insist upon verifying everything, quite independently of\ntheir reports. Let me see! I have met the Russian ambassador--but no,\nthere have been two more since then. However I am not without influence\naltogether.\"\n\nHe waved his hand for me to go, and I slipped off, after a good kiss\nfrom my mother, who always gave way to the sentimental vein, when my\nfather fell into the financial. And sure enough our finances were of a\npensive character just now. My duty was clearly to allow my dear parents\nplenty of time to discuss me from my birth up to the present moment; and\nfinding myself just a little in the fidgets and unfit for steady work,\noff I set through the park to our old house, to inquire whether Stoneman\nhappened to be at home. For he had taken his holiday, and was come back;\nand so far as one could judge him by his looks and walk, he found\nhimself better suited in his native land than elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nIN THE QUIET PLACES\n\n\n\"Gone to the City, sir,\" said the man, who opened the door which I knew\nso well, and it had a few reasons for remembering my childhood,\nimpressed or indented upon its lower panels; \"but he wanted to see you\nparticular, Master George; and he will be home by two o'clock. I was to\nsend down, and ask you to step this way by two o'clock, if you could any\nway spare the time, for he thinks to have a bit of a treat for you.\"\n\nHow small are our natures! I was pleased with Biddles for making a \"he\"\nof his master; when at every breath it would have been \"Sir Harold,\"\nwhile we could afford his livery. A fine old Englishman was this, full\nof pure feeling, and in heart disdainful of gold in comparison with\nrank; though compelled by his stomach to coerce the higher organ. \"How\nis your little Bob, Biddles?\" I asked; and it was better than\nhalf-a-crown to him.\n\nBefore I had time to pick more than fifty holes in the stockbroker's\ntaste as compared with our own, in came the man himself, full of high\nspirits, and alive with that vigour which the sparkling metal gives. Any\nman must be a cur who can snarl at a good friend, for enjoying the\nmarrow-bone, which has dropped betwixt his paws. Jackson Stoneman was\nnot without his faults; but it would have been mean to make them greater\nthan they were, just because he was able to pay for them.\n\n\"Just the man I wanted--the very man,\" he said, as if I was worth all\nthe Stock Exchange; \"what luck I have had all day! And you are come to\ncrown it. Here, you shall have my new Dougall, and I shall shoot with my\nold Lancaster.\"\n\n\"What a deuce of a hurry you are in!\" I answered, for his mind could\ngive me ten yards from scratch at any time. \"I am not come here to\nshoot. I have no time for such trifles. I want to have a serious talk\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Who do you think looked at me over the palings?\" he spoke as if he had\nquaffed a fine Magnum of Champagne, although he was a man of very great\ndiscretion. \"Over the palings, my boy; and after putting me down so the\nother day! I assure you it has quite set me up again; though I am afraid\nit was only an accident.\"\n\n\"You may be quite certain of that,\" I replied, for he wanted a little\nquenching; \"she went to get the last of the globe-artichokes, and of\ncourse when she heard a horse she looked up. Old Sally looks up whenever\nany one goes by.\"\n\n\"I tell you there was no looking up about it. Globe-artichokes are as\nhigh as any woman's head. You are not going to put me down about that.\nAnd she kissed her hand to me. What do you think of that?\"\n\n\"If you took off your hat, she could do no less to a kind friend of her\nmother. My affairs in that line are not flourishing. But I don't want\nanother fellow to be made a fool of, Jackson. Can't you try to show a\nlittle common-sense?\"\n\n\"Grapes sour, George? Well, I am sorry. But I fear you have not invested\nwell, my son. What are those foreign girls? Do you think I would ever\nlook at them, with a ghost of a chance of a thorough English maiden?\nWhen it comes to an English girl, you know where you are, and no\nmistake.\"\n\n\"All this is below contempt,\" I answered, for he had taken altogether\nthe wrong tone with me. \"Let me hear no more of such stuff; we are not\nboys. What is it you want me to shoot?\"\n\n\"Well, that is a gracious way of putting it, when I offer you a chance\nanybody else would jump at. Guy Fawkes' day not come, and behold three\nwoodcocks marked down in the Pray-copse!\"\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it. They never come here yet. The earliest I\never shot was on the fifteenth. But if you can swallow it, I don't mind\ngoing with you.\"\n\n\"Well said. And back to dine with me at six o'clock. No scruple about\ncertificate in this, though to my mind the woodcock is the best of\nBritish game. We'll call for the spaniels at Ponder's cottage. Best foot\nforemost!\"\n\nIt was a bright autumnal afternoon, after a touch of white frost, and\nagainst the sky every here and there some bronzy leaf would swing and\nglisten like the pendulum of a clock at winding time. But most of the\nfoliage now had finished its career of flaunt and flutter, and was lying\nat our feet in soft brown strewage, or pricking its last crispage up,\nwhere a blade of grass supported it. While at every winding of the\nmeadow path (which followed the hedge like a selvage), how pleasant it\nwas to see afar the wavering sweeps of gentle hill, and plaits of rich\nembosomed valley, with copse, and turnip-field, and furzy common patched\nwith shadow. It made me bless the Lord at heart for casting my lines in\na quiet land, where a man beholds no craggy menace, black rush of blind\ntempests, bottomless gulfs, unfathomed forests, and peaks that would\nfreeze him into stone. For the people that live there must be in a wild\ncondition always; to tremble at Nature's fury, or to shudder at her\nmajesty, or look around on all that wraps them up, with desolate\nindifference.\n\nI glanced at Stoneman walking briskly with his gun upon his shoulder,\nand death to at least a dozen woodcocks in the keen flash of his eyes;\nand I said to myself--\"Please God, I will take a game-certificate, next\nAugust; there is nothing like a good day's shooting to save one from\nblood-thirstiness.\"\n\n\"Jackson, my boy!\" I said, with the refrain of a fine old Yankee song\narising in my memory, \"you have been over half the world; but have you\never been in the Caucasus?\"\n\n\"No, and don't want;\" he answered shortly, \"get robbed enough in London\nvillage. But they strip you naked there, I hear, and send you down a\nwaterfall. Shamyl did it to some young chap, who might have set up\nagainst him.\"\n\n\"That is a fiction of his enemies. The Avar Chief was dry in his manner\nto strangers; and who can wonder at it? But he never harmed one of his\nown race. I wish we had a few such patriots.\"\n\n\"Very well. You start the band. You are qualifying well, with all those\nEgyptian fellows in the valley. But George, you are much too good for\nthat. There are pretty girls in every caravan; but we don't jump over\nthe broom-stick with them.\"\n\nDariel and a broom-stick! Indignation may flash as fast in the meadows\nas in the mountains. \"You idiot! You talk like an utter cad,\" I cried;\nand he being quick of temper too, stood his gun against a tree, and\nlooked at me. I set my gun by the side of his. \"Let us have it out,\" was\nall I said.\n\nBut a gleam of reason came across him. He might have polished me off,\nperhaps, though he would not have found it very easy, for I was the\nheavier of the two, and in tidy rural condition. \"What rot this is!\" he\nsaid, lowering his hands. \"If you like to have a good smack at me, you\ncan. But I won't hit a fellow with Grace's eyes.\" I knew that he had\nmeant business, and that there was no white feather in his nature.\n\nHe begged my pardon, and we shook hands; and I felt just a little\nashamed of myself, although when I think of what he said, I see no\nmisbehaviour on my part.\n\nWithout another word, we dropped the question, and went on to look after\nthe woodcocks. We crossed the long \"pray,\" with the keeper and three\nspaniels coming after us, and whether it was that Jackson's hand shook\nafter menacing \"the eyes of Grace,\" or that mine was extra steady\nthrough that firm assertion of Dariel, it came to pass that I knocked\nover both of the birds that we put up, when they were sailing away from\nJackson's gun. The other longbill saved his bacon, by keeping it out of\nhuman eyes. These lucky shots, and the pleasant walk, and very fine\nbehaviour of the dogs--who were children of the animals I had loved and\nchastened, in the better days both for them and me--put me into so noble\na frame of mind, that after an excellent dinner and a glass or two of\nPort wine with the violet bouquet in it, I up and told Stoneman my own\nlove-story; for I knew that the whole of it must come out now.\n\nHe, being pretty much in the same condition, though without anything\nlike my excuse for it, listened as if he had never heard anything half\nso surprising and engrossing, and inspiriting. In fact, he seemed to\ntake the whole of it as applicable to his own case, though it was beyond\nmy power to perceive even the faintest analogy. His was an ordinary\nlove-affair with nothing remarkable about it, unless it were that money,\nwhich is the usual obstacle by its absence, was the obstacle here by its\npresence. But in my case money was the last thing thought of. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar\nhad never mentioned it; and as for me, I only hoped that Dariel might\nnever own a shilling, because then she would appreciate my few\nhalf-crowns. And I still possessed her ruby cross, and meant to keep it,\nuntil it should be mine by legal right. Ah, who can spy any chance of\nthat through all the gloom impending?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nPIT-A-PAT\n\n\n\"She didn't say that she could never care about me,\" replied the\nstockbroker, when I asked him what he thought. \"If she had, you wouldn't\nsee me here now. I should have been off to the real Rialto; for I've got\na first-rate fellow in the Avenue now.\"\n\n\"Jackson, my inquiry was about my own affair. I want to know what you\nthink of my chance there.\" I looked at him severely, for this\ninattention was too bad.\n\n\"Well, and I gave you a parallel. We are almost in the same boat, I\nshould say; though yours is a sort of savage canoe, full of Oriental\nfish-tails, no doubt, and liable to Vendetta, and many other frightful\nnuisances. To your young mind all that too probably increases the\nattraction. But to my mature views, there's romance enough and to spare,\nin a quiet English maiden,--sweet, gentle, affectionate,\nfirm-principled, and not too sure of her own mind. Are they to be\ndespised, because you can speak a civil word to them, without having a\nbullet through you? George, there is more romance really, where you know\nhow to behave, than where you don't.\"\n\n\"Can't see it,\" I answered, \"can't see it at all. Is it poetry to take\nup your spoon for pea-soup?\"\n\n\"Poetry be hanged!\" cried Jackson. And as it was only my brother who\nwent in for it, when I never could make a blessed rhyme, why should I\nstand up for the Muses, who had never deigned a glance at me?\nNevertheless, I was slightly shocked, for every man is, or ought to try\nto be, a little above the common mark, when he thinks he loves something\neven better than himself. And to be above the common mark is getting on\nfor poetry.\n\n\"You go your own way, and leave me to go mine.\" I spoke with that\nelbow-lift of the mind which resembles what coachmen used to do to one\nanother, when they met on the highroad, and did not want to raise the\nwhip. \"You will see, Jackson, if you live long enough, that I shall have\na better time than you will.\" For I knew that Grace needed a very light\nhand; though girls had not got their mouths just yet, half as much as\nthey have now.\n\n\"The Lord only grant me the chance of it!\" he replied, with the happy\nrashness of young men. It was not for me to speak against my sister; but\nI knew all her little ins and outs, and I daresay she thought that she\nknew mine.\n\n\"Let me come down to your happy valley,\" he continued, with that\ncontempt of my ideas, which I always leave Time to redress, and have\nseldom found him fail to do it. \"I want to see this perfect wonder. Why,\nShakespeare himself can have never created any heroine to compare with\nher. It is out of possibility, my dear George. Bless my heart--Imogen,\nPortia, Miranda, Rosalind, Juliet, Ophelia--no, she was weak--Sylvia,\nHelena, half a dozen others rolled into one, down in that little hole! I\nwant to see her, that I may learn to despise the best English girl ever\nborn; or try to pretend to do it, if she won't have me. Do you suppose I\nwas born yesterday?\"\n\nWhen a man carries on like this, you may say what you like--though you\nare Solomon's Mahatma--without getting a spark of wisdom into him. I\nlonged for Tom Erricker, who could always float on the top of a flood,\nbecause he was so light; and in a weak sort of way I had wanted him\noften, not to unload my mind upon him--for you might as well trust your\nwatch to a floating bladder--but to see him look buoyant, when my mouth\nwas full of brine. But Tom had been summoned by his electroplating\nparent to fall in love with a very nice young lady, whose father made\ndish-covers fluted in the rough. Those people had some shooting, and Tom\nthought that he could shoot. At any rate, it was better for him than the\nBar.\n\n\"You shall not come near my happy valley,\"--it would never have done for\nme to encourage this,--\"remember what you said of the hero who lives\nthere. You took him for a forger, or a ticket-of-leave man.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't care a fig what he is, so long as he gives you\nsatisfaction. But about Grace--I tell you I won't wait. If she kissed\nher hand to me, is not that enough to show--I shall be there to-morrow;\nbut you must not let her know.\"\n\n\"Not to-morrow, Jackson. Why, it is her butter-day. And if she could\never cut up rough, I believe it would be the butter, at this time of\nyear.\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. Nothing would ever make her peppery. And she is sure\nto be at home, and up in your part of the premises. That is where she\nlooks the most enthralling. But don't let her know, for the world, that\nI am coming.\"\n\nIt was fair that he should have his own way at last, after giving Grace\na luxury of time to think about him, since his offer was made about ten\ndays ago, when she put all the blame of her shilly-shally upon me! See\nhow differently I did everything.\n\nThe following morning I gave her a hint--for my duty was to her first,\nand long afterwards to Jackson--that peradventure somebody in the course\nof the morning might turn up, to have a look at me in the harness-room;\nbut she took the greatest pains not to understand me, and even put a\nparticularly simple jacket on, of buff-coloured linen smocked with blue,\nand a delicate suggestion of retiring fronds--almost like a landscape of\nforget-me-not and lady-fern. But the shade of it was nothing in\ncomparison with the shape, inasmuch as the latter was our Gracie's own;\nand everybody knows what that means. Only she herself had not the least\nidea about any part of it. All she cared for was to get on with her\nwork; so she kept all her body and arms in motion, as if she were intent\nupon throwing shadows.\n\nWhen the butter was coming forth, crowned with glory,--which the\ncleverest dairymaid may doubt about, as she has to do sometimes with a\nlittle pat or two inside her,--and the long slab of enamelled stuff (for\nwe could not afford white marble) was tilted so that every golden patin\ncould crisp itself without encroachment, and Grace, like a miser telling\nhis moidores, was entering the upshot upon a white slate hanging by a\nscarlet ribbon, and pondering in her heart with the scales behind her,\nwhether she had tried to cheat any one more than the good of the family\ndemanded, suddenly a riding-glove was waved inside the door, and its\nfingers went about like bananas on a string, because there was no flesh\ninside them.\n\n\"Can't have you now, Joe,\" Miss Grace cried, with a presence of mind\nthat could only be surpassed by the colour presented on her cheeks;\n\"come again in half an hour. I am calculating now.\" As if old Joe\nCroaker had ever even seen a glove!\n\n\"I won't say a word, if I may come in. Oh, do let me come in and be\ncalculated too. If I may only sit upon a pan upside down, or anyhow,\nquite out of sight in the corner. Oh, what a sweet place! I could live\nupon the smell of it. But I won't even go near the lace-edging of a\npat.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stoneman! Is it possible? This is one of my brother's proceedings.\nThat I cannot even finish a few pounds of butter! George has done many\ninconsiderate things--but this seems beyond even his temerity!\"\n\n\"Miss Cranleigh, I give you my word of honour that I have not even seen\nhim for the day. In fact I came to look for him, to say 'Good-bye,'\nbefore I start for Venice. One never knows when one may come back again,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"Of course not. There are so many lovely things out there. The only\nsurprising thing to me is, that any Englishman who can afford to travel\nspends so much of his time in this commonplace country.\"\n\n\"But you don't mean that! I do hope, Miss Cranleigh, that you have not\nso low an opinion of your own dear countrymen. And the dearer ones\nstill, your own countrywomen! Foreign girls are all very well in their\nway. But who with a pair of eyes in his head----\"\n\n\"You have seen more of them than I have, Mr. Stoneman. But everybody\nseems to say that they are most delightful. And even my poor brother\nGeorge,--but I forgot,--forgive me, I am not supposed to know anything\nof that.\"\n\n\"But I do. I know everything about it,\" that treacherous stockbroker\nwhispered: can any man be loyal to his best friend, when in love? \"What\na lucky chance that you should speak of that!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Stoneman; but I never spoke of anything. Only when a\nmystery is dwelling in one's mind, about one of those who naturally are\nthe dearest to one, and when one's parents do not condescend--you see\nwhat I mean; though I really mean nothing.\"\n\n\"Precisely. And with such swift intelligence as yours! It is not for me\nto hint at my own weak ideas--such a thing as that I never do. And when\nno one in the family cares a fig for my opinion----\"\n\n\"It is not at all fair of you to say that.\" Grace cast down her eyes,\nand then turned away in the most bewitching manner. The stockbroker\njumped up from his brown milk-pan; but she looked at him, and he sat\ndown again.\n\n\"Be careful, Mr. Stoneman, for I am afraid it has a crack. Sally says\nthey cannot make them, as they used to do! But as I was saying, both my\nfather and my mother are thoroughly aware of all your good-will. And\nthere is not a tenant on the property, I am sure----\"\n\n\"How can I think about the blessed tenants? Though of course I try to do\nmy duty to them. But oh, do give me a little taste of butter after\nthat.\"\n\n\"Am I a rogue, that I should dare do such a thing? Twenty-two pounds\nthere, and not a pennyweight to spare. And old Mrs. Ramshorn made a fuss\nlast time. After a cigar, how can you taste? Your taste must be very far\nfrom perfect.\"\n\n\"My taste is absolute perfection; and that is why--what I mean is, why I\nenjoy this most exquisite result. But a coward is ever so much worse\nthan a rogue; and to shrink from the test is cowardly. I could never\nhave believed it of Miss Cranleigh.\"\n\n\"Very well. But you shall pay for what you eat. I will take it from one\nof your own pats, that are going to the Hall in half an hour. But you\nmust not blame me if it is not first-rate. Slemmick, the cleverest man\nwe have, says that there is a leaf coming down now, which gets between\nthe blades of grass, and it is useless for the cows to blow at it, for\nit makes a point of getting into their very finest butter. George calls\nit nonsense. But what right has he, when Slemmick was brought up so much\nmore out of doors?\"\n\n\"Slemmick is sure to know most about it. A man who has never heard the\nnames of things, always knows most about them. Therefore do let me give\ntrue judgment on the butter.\"\n\n\"Then you have never heard the name of butter!\"\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear! you leave one less than a shred of the soundest\nargument,\" was the reply of the infatuated stockbroker. \"Reason\" would\nhave been the noun to use, after a twelvemonth of matrimony.\n\n\"Now you must understand,\" said Grace, in the flush of that triumph of\nintellect, \"that nothing ever tastes its best, when taken out of its\nproper course. No metal should ever be used with fresh butter. This is a\nblade of hard white wood, I quite forget the name of it. But I can\neasily find out. Let me run and ask old Sally. You can't wait? Very\nwell, then I must cut it short, and tell you when you come back from\nVenice. But to think that I made all of those, and the ready money they\nwill fetch!\"\n\nShe dropped her eyelids just a little, and spread one palm above them,\nas if the dance of pleasure in her eyes required veiling; and then she\nfinished her sentence. \"It is a lovely place, I hear. How nice it will\nbe, to be there! How much you will enjoy yourself!\"\n\n\"You are quite wrong there,\" replied Stocks and Stones. \"I expect to\nhave a most wretched time. What do I care for the Stones of Venice? I am\nnot going to please my very miserable self. You know why I am going,\nMiss Cranleigh.\"\n\n\"Mr. Stoneman! How should I know? I have not the very smallest idea!\"\nOh, what a dreadful story, Grace! And did you make it better or worse,\nby a blush, and quick palpitation of the guilty breast that harboured\nit?\n\n\"Then I am going for this cause. There is somebody in this country who\nhas got me entirely underfoot, and tramples on me every day. There is no\ncure for it, but to run away. I have no spirit left. My eyes are always\non the ground.\"\n\n\"Indeed! Well, I have not perceived that. But if you have no will of\nyour own, what else is there for you to do? But it seems so un-English\nto run away. You are not weak, Mr. Stoneman. My brother says that you\nare very strong. And he would be only too glad to help you. He is too\nfond of what the reporters love to describe as personal violence.\"\n\n\"If it were a man, I might have some hope, even without such a champion.\nBut when the tyrant is a lady, and the most perfect of her sex, one\nagainst whom it is impossible to rebel----\"\n\n\"This does you the very highest credit. And it is so unusual. A great\nfriend of mine, and such a sweet girl, quite adores her stepmother. But\nmen--though I know so little of them--but I fancied that they were apt\nto feel a kind--a kind of prejudice. Narrow, no doubt, but violent.\"\n\n\"It is worse than fifty stepmothers. My step is a quiet, sweet-tempered\nwoman; and I wish that I saw more of her; but she seems to prefer her\nown relatives. Now, as if you did not know what I mean! What did I tell\nyou the other day?\"\n\n\"A variety of things. And what did I tell you? And didn't you say very\nclearly that you liked me all the better for my objections?\"\n\n\"No, no. Come, that is a twist! I said that I respected your objections,\nbut thought them extremely romantic, and would live in the hope of your\ntrying to get over them. May I sit upon this tub, and reason with you?\nOh, how I wish I was a dairyman!\"\n\n\"My brother George is in love with a lady,\" said Grace, who never saw\nthe way to miss the very worst of jokes, \"who will want a lot of\npractice before she can sit down. What on earth will he do with her when\nhe gives a dinner-party?\" This was a thoroughly vulgar error, as I have\nshown most distinctly above.\n\n\"Poor George, what a fool he is making of himself! But no brother of\nyours could ever be a fool. Forgive me: for the moment I was forgetting\nthe great mental powers of your family, Miss Cranleigh.\"\n\n\"You need not call me that, unless you wish it. I mean at least--you\nneed not call me that, so often. After all that you have done for us, it\nsounds so formal.\"\n\n\"Bless your kind heart! what have I ever done for you? But Grace is what\nI should love to call you; Grace, Grace, and nothing else. Unless I\nmight add another word, beginning with a d----\"\n\n\"All words beginning with a d are bad. But there can't be much harm in\nGrace, that I know of. Only you shouldn't say it very often.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no! Not more than every time I breathe. Very often is\nsuperlative. And so are you. And therefore I am to say it, every time I\nsay you. So I will; am I not a worshipper of the Graces?\"\n\n\"You must not say it, every time you say me. And I made a dreadful slip,\nas you must perceive. I wasn't thinking for the moment. And surely you\nwould never dream of taking an advantage----\"\n\n\"Now come all they that wish me evil; all they that against me have\nimagined a vain thing----\"\n\n\"What else are you doing yourself, if you please? If you would only\nallow me one moment to explain----\"\n\n\"In the name of the Lord will I destroy them.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Jackson Stoneman!\"\n\nShe looked at him in doubt of his ferocity, or sanity; and he, in high\nspirits, clapped his heels on the floor and sprang up, and began to draw\nnearer. \"No tub will do for me. I must have a throne. I am the King of\nthe City, and of Surrey. Grace Cranleigh has proclaimed it.\"\n\n\"Truly you are in a great haste to crown yourself. She has never done\nanything of the kind. But if to make an ell out of half an inch is\nkingly----\"\n\n\"If I did that, I will soon put it right. Let me make half an inch out\nof the ell now.\"\n\n\"No, no! I insist upon your staying where you are. There is a little\ndoor going out, between these two pans; and unless you are quite\nsensible, you will see no more of me.\"\n\n\"How can I be quite sensible, when I see any? Oh, Grace, Grace, you\ncannot conceive what a relief to me it is, to be able to utter your\nname, with a joy, with a pride, with an ecstasy inconceivable!\"\n\n\"Mr. Stoneman, you are upon the Stock Exchange, and a certified\ndealer--is not that the proper term? Very well then; you don't deal with\nany property, until you get it.\"\n\n\"Don't we, though? Oh, Grace, if we did not, where in the world would\nour business be? But I don't want to talk shop now at all. I want to\ntalk something far outside of that.\"\n\n\"Shop-windows, perhaps.\" And then her heart reproached her, as it ought\nto do with one who has made a flippant stroke. But he had overdone his\nhit with her as well, and had the sagacity to wait for her remorse.\n\n\"I did not mean anything rude,\" she said, edging her own tub a little\nnearer, while the forget-me-nots on her bosom danced like flowers on a\nriver, when the mill-stream lifts; \"I say things I ought not to\nsay--what I mean is, I say things without meaning them.\"\n\n\"Whatever you say is the sweetest of the sweet,\" he answered with a\nsigh, that made his waistcoat keep the tune; \"and it is right to remind\nme of my distance, Miss Cranleigh; because I was taking liberties.\"\n\n\"I defy you to say such a thing to me again. You have not the least idea\nwhat I am like, when--when I feel that I have been unkind.\"\n\n\"Let me know what it is like,\" he whispered, \"when--when you feel that\nyou are getting kind again. O Grace, Grace, how I do love you!\" She\nlooked at him softly, and her blue eyes fell; and then she spoke\nsubmissively.\n\n\"Now don't pretend to say it; you must not pretend to say it--unless you\nare quite certain. Shall I tell you why?\"\n\n\"I say it a thousand times, and I will spend my life in saying it. You\nknow it as well as I do. Certain indeed! But tell me why?\"\n\n\"Only that I should feel it very much indeed, if I were not sure that it\nis perfectly true.\"\n\nThere were tears on her cheeks--the true playground of smiles; neither\ndid they look out of place, for there was not much sorrow in them.\n\nTo reassure herself, she whispered something altogether repugnant to the\nspirit of the Stock Exchange, silver, and gold, and even jewels. But\nthat blessed stockbroker knew the quickest way to close transactions. He\nswept back a mint-worth of ductile gold from the sapphires whose lustre\nwas tremulous with dew, and he gazed at them gently, tenderly,\ntriumphantly, yet not without fear and diffidence. \"All this committed\nto my charge?\" he asked, with the other arm defining the flexuous\ncircuit of his future realm.\n\n\"It may be a very poor investment,\" answered Grace; \"but one thing is\ncertain--what little there is, is entirely a genuine article.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_What little there is, is entirely a genuine article._\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nA PAINFUL DUTY\n\n\nIt is all very fine for those fine people who can carry on like that. My\nsister Grace gave ten thoughts to every pound of her own butter, for one\nshe could spare to every thousand pounds of Stoneman's money. A great\nweight of cash hung against him at first, in the scales of honest\naffection; but goodness, and kindness, and manly conduct, and\nbashfulness--thriving rather shyly in \"the House\" perhaps, but sprouting\nmore freely in our fine air--had gone down plump against the adverse\nweight of a metal which we seldom find too heavy. Yet people should keep\ntheir felicity quiet; even as a cat (whose name may be akin to it)\nshould purr before the fire, instead of squealing on the chimney-pot.\n\nBut Jackson went aloft, and began to look down upon me, to whom he owed\neverything, as he surely must have known. He chaffed me about my\nOriental Princess, a subject not only too lofty for him, but exceedingly\npainful to me just now. For I felt myself out in the cold, as it were;\nand with all due allowance for exalted spirits, there is such a thing as\ngood taste; and there is, or ought to be, such a thing as sympathy. And\nthe deeper a man is down in the hole of love, the more should the fellow\nat the top desire, and strive (without hooking him in the back) to wind\nhim up to bank again. However, I never let them hear a groan, but\nendeavoured to content myself by meditating on the comparative grandeur\nof my own position.\n\nGrace was all pity, and flutter, and excitement, and very tender\ninterest about my state of mind, and laid down the law, like the Lord\nChief-Justice in some very complicated Liquidation-suit. But when I\nsaid to her point-blank, \"Very well; as you have it all so clear, let me\ndrive you in mother's pony-trap; and then you will make it all right for\nme with S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, and with Dariel,\" to my great disgust her answer was,\n\"I am quite ready, George--if dear Jack thinks it proper.\"\n\n\"Dear Jack, indeed!\" I replied with undisguised contempt, for Stoneman\nhad persuaded her to drop the \"son\"; or perhaps she had made him his own\nfather. At any rate, they had found out between them that \"Jack\" was of\nhigher rank among the novelists than his offspring had as yet attained.\nHowever that might be, he was her Jack-of-all trades now; and I, who\nonce did everything, must be proud of second fiddle.\n\nThat settled all interference of theirs. And, in truth, I would not have\nlet her interfere if a thousand dear Jacks had sanctioned it. In the\nflow or ebb of his own affairs, let every man paddle his own canoe.\n\nInspirited thus, I made up my mind that if Harold did not appear right\nearly, the proper thing for me would be to pay my visit without him, for\nthe master of the place had clearly said that I might call upon him at\nany time; though that would be of little comfort to me, unless I might\ncall upon his daughter too. And here I confessed myself quite at a loss,\nbeing entirely in the dark as to the social usages, and the tiptop tone\nof the Caucasus, which must be in a position to look down upon ours. But\nI said to myself, \"Shall extreme humility bring me to so low a pass,\nthat a savage young Osset--whatever that may be--shall trample on the\nBritish flag? That a swaggering bully who scorns noble dogs, and breaks\nthe legs of lovebirds, shall scare a young Englishman from his true\nlove, and carry her off, and disdainfully treat her, as Rakhan his\nfather behaved to his mother? Where is my courage, or sense of right, or\neven manly compassion, that I should permit such a sacrilege as that?\"\n\nNot only was I warmed by these large reflections, but touched up also by\nthe little prick of thorns, which the May-bloom hedge of another\nfellow's love-nest sometimes administers to the plodder in the lane. So\nI came to this practical conclusion--take the bull by the horns, and\nhave it out with him. For this gallant purpose, forth I set about two\no'clock of a November day, with a little drizzle in the air, but not\nwhat an Englishman would call a real fog.\n\nPerhaps I may have mentioned, though I will not be too sure, that a\nlittle trifle of a brook arises, among the few fields which we still\nkept in hand, and contrives to make its way, without venturing upon\nnoise, but accepting every zigzag that any hedgerow offers, down the\ntrend of land that goes away very mildly, until it gets view of a\nvalley. And then there are thickets, and corners of halt, and windings\nof the little water, and flat beds strewn with the season's leaves,\nwhere birds of the neighbourhood, or of passage, find an agreeable\nchange of diet, or of rest when their wings are weary. And a man with a\ngun may get a very pleasant shot, if he probes this sweet home of theirs\nwarily.\n\nEven the tiniest brook ever seen must lead to something larger; but\naccording to the lie of the land, this runnel must wayfare long on its\nown account, before it meets the Pebblebourne. Woodcocks are apt to be\nsomewhat capricious birds. Sometimes we never heard of one almost\nthroughout the winter, and the next year, perhaps, it would come into\ntheir heads that there was nothing like a happy Surrey coppice. This\nyear they had taken that correct view of us, and our duty was to make it\nfinal. So I whistled for my favourite spaniel _Bess_, and with my old\nbreechloader on my arm, set off for a roundabout walk towards St.\nWinifred's. If I had the luck to bring down a long-bill, perhaps a fair\ncreature might immortalise him.\n\nAfter a long rough trudge through fern and swamp and briary thicket, I\nheard the murmur of a larger stream, which could be no other than the\nPebblebourne. Daylight began to fail, and the mist was deepening in the\nvalley, so I took a short cut towards the ancient walls with my little\noffering provided. A woodcock, a leash of snipe, and a widgeon were more\nthan I had expected, and a pheasant or two would have borne them\ncompany, if it had been lawful.\n\nSuddenly from a little glade of covert a frightful sound invaded me. It\nwas not like the cry of a cow for her calf, nor that of a dog with a\ncart-wheel on his tail, nor even the fitful palinode of a cat upon the\nroof, suffering deep remorse of love. But if there be any organ capable\nof combining a wail, a bellow, a shriek, and a yell, with a howl and a\nmoan, and a few other indications that all is not perfect bliss here\nbelow, that instrument must have been doing its utmost in the dusky\ncopse before me. My pet spaniel little _Bess_ slank away behind my\nheels, and covered her eyes with her ears to exclude such an audible\nvision of the Evil One. But a man alone, or at any rate a member of the\nhuman race alone, could compass an effect so horrendous. My blood ran as\ncold as the water in my boots, and if I had stopped to think for even\nhalf a second, right-about-face would have been the order.\n\nBut real curiosity must never stop to think. With a few rapid steps I\nwas over the low stile, and stood in the tangled enclosure. Like the\nshrillest fog-screecher that has ever been invented, that sound led me\nunmistakeably, until I saw a little dark man struggling for his life\nagainst victorious bondage. He was corded to a tree no larger in the\ntrunk than he was, so that it just filled the hollow of his back; his\nwrists were tied behind it, and his feet being lifted high enough above\nthe ground to deprive him of all leverage, the publication of his sorrow\nwas the sole resource. The last light of day was rolling, rather than\nflashing, in his helpless eyes; and the cruel distortion of his\nanguished face might have foiled his own mother's faith in him. And his\nyells were not those of our language, which can assert itself, even in\nour outcries.\n\nMy impulse of course was to rush forward, and succour this poor victim;\nand I went for it at once, although I saw that two strong men sat gazing\nat him. One of them was tall and dark, and a foreigner all over; while\nthe other was bulky and big of limb; and both were jeering pleasantly.\nWith my gun on the left arm, I pulled out a knife, and rushing between\nthem before they could rise, cut the cords of the captive, and eased him\ndown on my shoulder, and lo, it was Allai!\n\nHe uttered a guttural something, altogether beyond my philology, and\npicked up his pet little jingal from the moss, and was off like a hare,\nbefore I could speak. When I turned round, a man stood on either side\nof me, but not quick enough to grasp my arms. I jumped back, so as to\nget the tree in front, and cried, \"Fair play, you rascals! If you want\nto taste an ounce of shot apiece, here it is at your service.\"\n\nThe tall man turned away, as if that proposal were not much to his\nliking. But the other stood his ground, and spoke, as if he knew that I\nwould not fire. \"Who are you? What's your business here? Mind your own\naffairs. We were only having a bit of fun.\"\n\n\"Well, and so am I. It is quite as good fun to scare two scamps, as to\nbully a helpless little devil.\"\n\n\"Right you are,\" he exclaimed with a laugh, which made me think better\nof him, for he could not know that I had drawn my cartridges when I left\noff shooting; \"but we are not scamps, young man; we were performing a\npainful duty.\"\n\n\"You said it was a bit of fun just now. At any rate I have stopped it.\nAnd if you find that a grievance, I will put down my gun and meet you.\nBut only one at a time, mind.\"\n\n\"What an obliging man you are! And you stand nearly six inches over me.\nMy friend would have a better chance with you. But he does not\nunderstand 'the box.' You have spoiled our day's work. Who are you?\"\n\n\"I have a right to ask that question first. I am in my own\nneighbourhood, as you can see. But you are a stranger, and doing strange\nthings. Tell me your name, sir; and you shall have mine.\"\n\n\"Fair enough. I am Captain Strogue of the British Pioneers,--not ashamed\nof my name, and not likely to be, though it is better known all round\nthe world than at home. You think me a coward for tormenting a small\nchap. It only shows your ignorance of that race.\"\n\n\"It is not brave to torture anybody, Captain Strogue. But that is no\nlonger my business. My name is George Cranleigh, well known about here.\nWhat I have done I would do again, and so would any other Englishman.\"\n\n\"Likely enough. But it is unlucky, and you may have done a world of\nmischief. However, I bear no grudge against you. Some day perhaps you\nwill be sorry for it. But where the deuce is the--why, hang me upside\ndown, if he has not vanished!\"\n\nThe Captain seemed eager to do the like, and it was not my place to stop\nhim. He lifted his brown hat to me, and was gone, leaving upon me the\nimpression of a man, resolute, testy, adventurous, excitable, and\nperhaps unscrupulous.\n\nAs to the other man, although he had not presented himself distinctly,\nwhat other could he be than Hafer, the son of Imar's sister Marva, and\nnow the Chief of the Osset tribe? Although I had not seen his face that\nnight when he left Dariel weeping (neither had I seen it plainly now),\nthe figure and carriage and style of dress were quite enough to convince\nme. Even in the dark there had been something about that fellow--or\nPrince, as some would call him--and about the moral smell of his nature,\nunpleasant, to use the mildest word that I can think of, to my plain and\nsimple elements. He might be the better man of the two, more kindly,\nmore trusty, more lovable, and of a higher stamp in every way. Never\nmind; I had not the least desire, though he were all that, to resemble\nhim. And Providence, having made us as we are, cannot take it amiss if\nwe are satisfied.\n\n\"I shall have a good look at him some day,\" I thought, \"and then I am\nsure to feel that I was right. I can have no prejudice against him,\nmerely because he has dared to look at Dariel. She, who takes so long to\nsee what I am, is not at all likely to be carried by storm by this\nfellow's olive complexion, and fine nose, and black eyes, and sable\nmoustache, and all the rest of it. Why, he is a brute, and nothing else,\nhowever handsome he may try to look! I can scarcely believe him to be\nthat noble man's own nephew.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTREMBLING\n\n\nHowever, these great reflections did not save me from being in a rather\nnervous state when Stepan, who was most obsequious now,--if such a word\nmay be used of such a steadfast hero,--showed me into S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's room.\nAnd before he raised the curtain, he whispered in best English, \"Milord,\nme good friend to milord now. Allai worth dogs, dogs, all right a\nhundred dogs.\" I pressed his hand, because he was thus cultivating our\ndear language.\n\n\"It is long since I have seen you,\" S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar began, with his kind and\ncheerful but never joyful smile. \"I began to fear that you had taken\namiss something of what I said the other day. It is difficult at such\ntimes to consider one another. But all right, as Stepan says. He is\nbecoming quite an Englishman. Did you notice the fogle, as you call it,\nthis child of the Caucasus has picked up somewhere? It is the envy of\nall our encampment. What a simple-minded race we are! But that is a\nmaterial to work upon for good. And soon we shall be among the heart of\nit again. What will my daughter think of her native mountains?\"\n\n\"But surely,\" I answered in a melancholy voice,--\"surely you will not\ntake her to that frightful place--I beg your pardon, to all that world\nof grandeur--when everything is frozen, and there is not a place to sit\nupon. When there is not a flower, not a blade of green grass, nor even a\ntree that is not a hump of snow. You may find it very nice; but young\nladies--S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, have you thought about her constitution?\"\n\n\"My young friend, I have; and it is as sound as mine. There will not be\nmuch society; but has she any here? From all that I have seen of it,\nand I lived some time in London, society means pretence, affectation,\njealousy, littleness, stale slang instead of humour, slavish imitation,\ncontempt of fellow-creatures, and cowardly blindness to the afflictions\nof this earth. My daughter has no taste for such a life as that.\"\n\nHe appeared to me to speak too strongly, and too much from a primitive\npoint of view; and all who set up such a standard as that are impatient,\nand apt to exaggerate. But it was not for a country Lubin to vindicate\nthe ladies, and I was in haste to deal with nearer considerations.\n\n\"Perhaps you will be angry with me,\" I said, \"but you have told me so\nmuch of yourself, that you will not regard it as a liberty. Are you\nsure, sir, that you do not imperil your life by returning to people so\nrevengeful?\"\n\n\"As certain as a man can be who knows their obstinacy, and the power of\nlong tradition. And who would wish to harm me now? My sister made much\nfor a time of her wrongs about the marriage portion; but her wicked\nhusband's public vaunt that he had slain our father, and my surrender of\nall her share as soon as she was a widow, must have taken the sting from\nthat. And as for Rakhan, and his death, could she prefer a faithless\nhusband to her own twin brother?\"\n\n\"Well, you know best, sir. But is there not a son of that same Prince\nRakhan, 'Hafer' you called him the other day, who may feel himself bound\nby that fiendish law, even if his mother rejects it?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I hope to introduce him to you. A young man of what you call a\nrough and ready nature, the natural produce of a rugged land. Too\nfree-spoken perhaps, and apt to give offence to those who dislike strong\nconvictions. But I hear that among his own people he is beloved, and\nadmired beyond all example, for his justice, mildness, and unbounded\ngenerosity. The Ossets are not what you have in this country, advanced\nand experienced Christians. On the contrary, it is a painful fact that\nthe larger half are idolaters; and of them, and of the Christians too,\nnot one in ten is far off from a thief. This makes them thoroughly\nworthy of the deepest British interest. In going round the globe so\nmuch, you never care about any race that is beginning to get better.\nYour own, for instance, is nothing to you. You can hope for the best\nabout them; and believe that the Lord, who governs the earth for the\nbenefit of the British race, will make it all right for the worst of\nyou. Upon that point you have no misgivings, any more than you have\nabout any others, when you feel yourselves summoned to improve the\nworld. But my duty is upon a very small scale, and is limited to my own\npeople.\"\n\nGreat as my reverence was for S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, it was difficult not to suspect\nthat some adverse influence had been at work with him. Hitherto he had\nalways expressed a genial admiration of our race, which had produced on\nmy part a corresponding respect for his uncommon powers of insight and\nfreedom from foreign prejudice. \"You have taken a turn against us,\" I\nreplied with some warmth, and looking at him as I had never looked\nbefore; \"time will show who is right, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar.\"\n\n\"My young friend,\" he answered, \"you are quite mistaken. I am not\nleaving you through my own wish. Such quiet days I shall never know\nagain, and such kind respect for my privacy, even with ten feet of snow\nround my walls. For the sake of my countrymen I must go. That I cannot\ndo much is quite certain; but I hope to start them on a better course.\nFor years, as you know, I have been preparing, and my first chance of\ntrying it is come at last. Am I likely to speak ungratefully of the only\nland on the face of the earth that would receive me, without a thousand\nmortifications and annoyances? Why, even your tax-collectors have been\ncivil.\"\n\nThis was a climax of approbation which amazed, and by power of contrast\npuzzled the warmest asserter of national virtue. \"Surely you cannot mean\nthat!\" I exclaimed. But romantic as he was, he nodded.\n\n\"Now, as you charge me with distrust of England, and I may have said\nsome ungracious things,\" he spoke with a smile almost as bright as\nDariel's, \"show your forgiveness, my dear friend, by coming with me into\nmy daughter's room. We are beginning to put up our little possessions,\nfor the journey to a rougher place. How many thousand times shall we\nregret the halcyon days in this quiet little vale! But come and have a\ncup of coffee.\"\n\n\"I am not fit to go into a lady's room. I have got about a pint of\nwater in either boot. They are warranted waterproof, and so they won't\nlet it get out again.\"\n\n\"We'll soon put that to rights. You should wear arabas. Come into this\npassage, and Stepan will see to it, and bring you a pair of my sandals.\nI will be with you again in a minute.\"\n\nWhile the faithful henchman was pulling off my boots, which was no small\ntug for even his great arms, his mind was evidently in a condition of\nstill more strenuous exertion. She--if the higher portion of our\ncomposition lays claim to the higher half of gender--was struggling and\nrolling and flopping about (being over-bulky for lighter process) in\nquest of some fugitive English word, earnestly courted, but wickedly\ncoy.\n\n\"Milord, put on more smoke, more smoke. Yes, yes, more smoke, else be\ntoo late. Me good friend to milord now. Wicked mens come every day. But\nmilord smoke, smoke, smoke.\"\n\nHe puffed with his lips and panted, as if to impress me with the need\nfor a vast fumigation. \"I want a pipe sadly, my friend,\" I replied; \"but\nhow can I have it in a lady's room?\"\n\nThe Lesghian stared at me, and stroked his beard, and shook his head\nangrily, as if he had found it empty. \"Stepan fool. No say, no say,\" he\nexclaimed as he made off to fetch the slippers; but I am afraid that I\nheard him mutter, as he turned the corner, \"Inglese, dam languidge; dam\nlanguidge, Inglese!\" In a minute, however, he returned, with a broad\nsmile lighting up all his battered countenance, as if he had found what\nhe wanted in the sandals.\n\n\"Me know now. Stepan big fool. Milord put on shteam, shteam, shteam! Go\nahead! Who's afeard? Won't go home till mornin'? The gal I left behind\nme. Nancy is my darlin'! Milord know now.\"\n\n\"I am blest if I do,\" I endeavoured to reply; but he would have no more\nquenching. In the triumph of philology his dignity was lost; and I saw\nthat he must have spent at least a day in London. \"Is the Caucasus come\nto this?\" I asked, and was glad to see my host return.\n\nStepan stood up, and shut his mouth in the curtain of his beard, like a\ncasement closed under the ivy, and looked at me, as if there had never\nbeen less than a mile of moral distance between us. In the name of the\nLord, where does sham end? But I had to do a little on my own account.\n\nDariel's room! I had never been in the shrine of my divinity till now;\nand when I was there I could look at nothing except her entrancing\npresence. She was resting upon something--it might have been a cloud,\nfor all that I could tell about it. The soft light fell upon the\nsweetest face that heaven itself ever shone upon; and I tried to speak,\nbut no words came; neither could I look upon her as I longed to do. If\nshe had been too much for me out of doors, what possibility was left me\nhere?\n\n\"My child,\" said her father,--for she too was silent, which emboldened\nme to steal an ecstatic dream of the petals of a blush-rose fluttering\non her face,--\"my child, I have brought our kind friend, Mr. Cranleigh,\nwho has placed us under so many obligations, to say good-bye, or at\nleast good-night; for I hope that we may see him again before we leave.\nWe have taken you a little by surprise, I fear.\"\n\n\"But it is a pleasant surprise, dear father. I was a little--what is the\nproper English word?--melancholy? No, I can never be that with you. But\nsorry, perhaps,--out of spirits, is it so? We have been so happy in this\nvery tranquil rest.\"\n\n\"It is true,\" replied S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, as he turned to me; \"perhaps we shall\nnever have so smooth a time again. It is like the beginning of a new\nlife to us. But Dariel knows that we must not think of our own comfort\nonly.\"\n\n\"No, but of our lives--of your life, father. What does it matter to me\nwhere I go? But we are travelling from a land where you are safe to a\ncountry of savages, where there is no law, but everybody burning to kill\neverybody else.\"\n\n\"A pretty description of your native land! It is the air of this\ncountry, Mr. Cranleigh. My daughter has breathed it so long that she\nbelieves that there is no other excellence under the sun. We know that\nit has some such effect upon the natives. But why should it be so with\na little foreign girl? Dariel, my dear, I feel ashamed of you?\"\n\n\"Oh, how much better does he know than that!\" the loving daughter\nexclaimed, as she placed both hands upon his shoulders and her face\namong his beard, whose dark cascade spared a silver rill or two to\nglisten through the sable of the young abundance; and thence she looked\nat me with a snug composure, as if to ask, \"What do you want with\npassion? This is affection, if you please. This is all that a sweet girl\nneeds.\" And then she very calmly stroked his moustache up, and put her\nlips to his, and kept them there, till I could almost hope that he might\nprove to have taken a taste of garlic. But perhaps if he had, it would\nhave been all the same to her.\n\n\"You see what our manners are,\" said the father, with a laugh; \"we have\nnot quite attained the proper self-command, I fear.\" And then I had my\nrevenge; for Dariel blushed as if she had done an outrageous thing, and\nwhispered, \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\"\n\nIt was a lucky thing for her, perhaps, although a sad one for poor me,\nthat her father was so close at hand; else how could I have controlled\nmyself? For, being a little repressed, she turned the ardent appeal of\nher eyes on me, quite as if--quite as if I had been a member of the\nfamily. And when I smiled, not reassurance only, but most loyal\nencouragement, what did she do but glide away from papa, and sit down by\nthe visitor!\n\n\"Oh, Grace, you are graceful enough,\" thought I, \"for yourself, and for\nany stockbroker. But if you want to know how to sit down, you must come\nand see Dariel do it.\" For she had told Jackson, and he in his lunacy\nthought it too good to be kept to himself, that her brother George, if\nhe got the wife he wanted, would be obliged to put her through a course\nof chair-drill before he could give a dinner-party!\n\nHow I trembled to find myself sitting at her side, indoors, unhurried,\nwith the sanction of authority, civilised, waiting for a cup of coffee,\nwatching the turn of her exquisite hands, nettled by the dancing of the\nclustered hair, which drew a veil, always at the most provoking moment,\nover the lustrous speech of those myriad-flashing and yet ever gentle\neyes, as the filigree of some crafty jeweller tempers and deepens the\ndelight within! What was there for me? Could a common sort of fellow,\nwith nothing but rough truth and deep worship to commend him, dare to\nsuppose that he could ever get in there, and be cherished as the owner\nof the heart that moved the whole?\n\nI assure you that I made a great fool of myself; though such an\nassurance is superfluous to any man who has ever earned his salt. I had\njust enough sense left to say \"Yes\" or \"No,\" with a \"Please\" in a deep\nbreath now and then, and a \"Thank you\" that took away breath altogether.\nDariel, who was as fit as a fiddle--how those low expressions spoil\none's most exalted moments!--saw with her ill-timed serenity the\nconfounded tumult of my system; and, as she told me in the wiser days,\nfelt ashamed of herself for enjoying it. Ah, me! it is not often, in the\nlittle square-round of human life, that we get tossed over the\nboundaries thus, with the profundity of misery struggling with the\nsublimity of ecstasy.\n\n\"My dear young friend,\" said the tranquil Lesghian, who had let his eyes\nfollow the lines of his beard in amiable serenity, though there must\nhave been a stealthy smile under it, \"few things are more gratifying\nthan to have one's own productions valued by those who understand the\nsubject, and speak without prepossession; especially when the producer\nhas departed from general usage, and carried out his own opinions. You\nare really sure that you admire----\"\n\n\"Admire is too weak a word, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar,\"--my eyes were still upon the\ncharming result of his system of education,--\"worship, love, adore,\nenshrine----\"\n\n\"We will put it on the labels of our tins, as soon as we have a London\nagency. But only your initials, as your friends might not approve. I am\nalways at a loss for those strong, expressive words of your language,\nwhich now survive only in advertisements. My dear, put them down in your\ntablets; I defy any soap to surpass them. G. C. worships, loves, adores,\nand enshrines the coffee of the Caucasus. I am not enthusiastic, Mr.\nCranleigh; but next to education and the spread of Christianity, I trust\nto the civilising effects of commerce, which your nation insists upon,\nperhaps even more strenuously than the other two great agents. The\nRussians have introduced the growth of tea, and I heartily hope that it\nmay answer. But knowing the genius of our people, which certainly is not\ninclined to persistent toil, I have come to the conclusion that coffee,\nwhich requires less constant attention, would have a better chance upon\nour Southern slopes, where the summer is long and the heat intense. I\nwish I could have seen your brother Harold, that universal genius, about\nit. The preparation which has so impressed you is not from our native\nberries yet, only from the slopes near Tiflis. But I hope we shall have\nour own in a few years' time. And then my discovery comes in.\"\n\nFor all that I knew to the contrary, I might have been drinking\nbilge-water flavoured with tar and stirred with marlin-spikes. But I\ngrasped his hand with emotion, and said, \"No words are adequate, S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar.\"\n\nHe must have known as well as I did--or what would be the good of his\nhaving ever loved his Oria?--that confusion was far too weak a word, and\nfusion itself not strong enough to describe the condition of my brain.\nTill Dariel, with one precious glance of reserve and soft sympathy--as\nif her father really must not claim to be the only one having any\nknowledge of me--bowed for me to move a little; and oh, she quite hung\nover me! For, being so stupid, I had not moved; and stupidity gets the\nprize more often than the cleverest volatility. \"Darling!\" I whispered\nthrough her hair; for her father was gone to his coffee-grinder, to\nsecure some more of my adoration. And Dariel only whispered \"Hush,\" with\na quiver, but no repugnance.\n\n\"Father,\" she said with pure presence of mind, as he looked round from\nhis grinding, \"my senestra is a little out of tune; but Mr. Cranleigh\nwill allow for that. He is kind enough to wish to hear me sing; and he\nthinks that my voice is rather agreeable.\"\n\n\"He is right enough in his judgment there. But what opportunity has he\never had of hearing it?\" This question made me tremble when I thought of\nmy first offence; but the nymph answered very bashfully--\n\n\"You remember--the day, dear father, when you invited Mr. Cranleigh to\nattend our little service. We all sang in our quiet way; and he was kind\nenough to be pleased with it.\"\n\n\"How could he be pleased? They do their best; and I am always proud to\nhear them. But, my dear friend, it is a frightful noise that drowns my\nchild's soft melody. Englishmen who have travelled among our mountains,\ntell their countrymen that all our voices are harsh and cackling,\nguttural and disagreeable. Some may be so, but not all, and in my\nopinion few of them. I am not a judge of music, but I think my child\nsings beautifully.\"\n\n\"Oh, father, you have spoiled it all. Mr. Cranleigh will expect wonders.\nAnd all I can do is so simple; only it sounds nice to me\nbecause--because I feel that I mean it.\"\n\n\"Then your voice must be of your own tongue. She can sing in English\nvery sweetly; but never with the expression which her native language\nbrings to her. Mr. Cranleigh says he would like best to hear you in your\nown language, dear; though he won't understand a word of it. That\nancient lay of Inkulluk, I like it as well as any. The words are\nnothing; but the melody has a tinkle like a mountain-stream, which\nmodern music seldom has. We call it the song of the stork, although\nthere is very little about them in it. If you like it, you shall have a\nprose translation, and perhaps your brother will put it into verse, for\nyou tell me he has even that accomplishment. Now try that simple little\nsong, my dear.\"\n\nThe lovely maiden, thus exhorted, smiled as she cast back her hair, and\nupon the white rise of her breast laid a musical affair of some dark\nwood, having divers strings and curves. Lute, zither, mandolin,\ntambourine, lyre, it was none of those, and I knew not, neither cared\nwhat it was, only to watch her swift white fingers dancing like\nsnowdrops inspired by the wind, and her lips like rosebuds tremulous.\nThe words were nothing but sounds to me; yet I knew, by the power she\ngave to them, that whoever could bring them home to her would have no\ncold-hearted wife to wed. And this is what Harold made of it:--\n\n\n                  THE SONG OF THE STORK.\n\n     \"When the veil of the mountains is lifted by Spring,\n       And the voice of the water saith--Winter is past:\n     When the stork from Armenia plies her glad wing,\n       And the ibex lies down, without fear of the blast;\n        With a heart that is warm as the nest of a dove,\n        In the bend of the valley, I wait for my love.\n\n     \"When the splendour of summer makes spangles of snow,\n       And lights with red lilies the gloom of the glen;\n     While the forest is flushed with azalea's glow,\n       And the melody of fountains floats through it again;\n        With a heart that is true to its nest as a dove,\n        On a lawn of sweet roses, I wait for my love.\n\n     \"When the tempests of Autumn have turban'd the peak,\n       And the gray shadows hover above their stronghold;\n     Yet the fruitage still lingers--a faint purple streak,\n       And the ripe corn embroiders the breastland with gold;\n        Though my heart may be quailing at the storm-clouds above,\n        Like the harvest, it answers the sunshine of love.\n\n     \"When the mountains are turned into caverns by snow,\n       And the heavens are black with the fury of cold,\n     When the spectre of Rakhabat stalks to and fro,\n       And the gaunt wolf is howling alone on the wold;\n        With the ice-crags around us, and the avalanche above,\n        My love shall not shiver in the breast of his love.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nREJOICING\n\n\nWhen I was going home that night, a very strange thing befell me, which\nbut for the mercy of Providence would have left me nothing more to say.\nAlthough there had been very little chance of making sweet speeches to\nDariel, because her father would not leave the room, yet her rich clear\nvoice thrilled through me so that I scarcely knew what I was doing, and\nresolved to put all upon the cast at once, rather than flutter, and\nquiver, and tremble till some swaggering foreigner rushed in.\n\nModest I was; and think no harm to confess it, having never had chance\nto grow out of it, by any fat manuring while my roots were young. Humble\nI was; and who would not be so, unless he were fool enough not to know\nthe difference between a mere hulking clodpole and the exquisite\nperfection of the Maker's finest work? Timid too I may have been; and\nwho can be surprised, when even a stockbroker trembled at our Grace? But\nas for my being a jelly-fish, could any such creature have done what I\ndid? I held the hand of my darling as long as I dared at the corner of\nthe passage, when her father was looking for a lantern, and I said with\nan audacity which frightened me as soon as I had time to think of it,\n\"To-morrow I must know my fate. Will you be in the chapel, about three\no'clock? Or any time, any time; I will wait for hours.\"\n\n\"What can make you ask me such a thing?\" she answered, and I said,\n\"Don't you know, Dariel?\" And she drew back, and whispered, \"I will\ntry--if my father has no objection.\"\n\nNow it was the thought of this that sent me in a most exalted yet\nhighly disordered condition of mind upon my homeward course. If order is\nheaven's first law, as some one says, the entire code must be suspended\nwhen the human race is in its most heavenly state. To me the earth was\nnothing; and the stars alone and the distant sublimity of the sky had\nany claim of kindred. Leaving _Bess_ (who was very tired) to the care of\nStepan, with a careless toss I flung my gun upon my right shoulder, and\nstrode forth into the darkness.\n\nSuddenly, as I was marching on a ridge of moorland about half a mile\nfrom the camp, I received a most shocking whack under the right ear, as\nif somebody had struck me with a big hockey-stick; and at the same\nmoment a flash of broad fire started up, and then a roar from a clump of\nbushes just beneath me. How I saved myself from falling is more than I\ncan tell, for I staggered very heavily, and my head went round.\n\nI cannot remember at all what I did, much less what I thought in this\nfrightful amazement, though afterwards I tried to make it out more\nclearly. But I must have kept hold of my gun, although my right hand was\njarred and tingling with it, and then I must have leaped into the bushy\nhollow, without time enough to realise the peril. And I shouted, which\nwas a most stupid thing to do; but I know that I shouted, because one of\nthe first things that fetched me to myself was the sound of my own\nvoice. But there was no one for me to lay hold of, or to let drive at\nwith the butt of my gun. The place was all silent and empty, and I saw a\ngreat star shining through the naked twigs from the crown of the ridge I\nhad been crossing, and I knew that I had been shot at by the advantage\nof that star.\n\nTo the inhabitants of a lawless country this may be little to dwell\nupon; but never having been among such crooked lines of action, I knew\nnot what to make of it. My blood ran cold at the enormity of the thing;\nbut without further reasoning I pulled out a brace of cartridges, which\nI ought to have done before entering the hollow, and slipped them into\nmy old breechloader. Then I found that the right hammer would not move,\nand began to perceive what had happened. There was no time to go into\nthat question now. With the left hammer cocked, and the muzzle level and\nready for a snap-shot--though probably my nerve would have failed me at\na fellow-creature--I searched every yard of the thicket, and then the\ngully which led to a little watercourse below. The night, having only\nthat big star to help it, was so dark and baffling that a dozen men\nmight have slipped away without leaving me any the wiser; and the only\ntrace vouchsafed to me was a rustle of some bushes at the bottom of the\nslope where a hedge ran along. At this I brought my gun to my shoulder,\nfor I might just have peppered a man down there, and that would have\nbeen a caution to him. However, on second thoughts, I did not fire, for\nby this time I was quite cool again, and the blaze might have brought\nanother bullet at me before I could pop another cartridge in. So I\nmarked the spot very carefully, and hurried home with gratitude.\n\nAnd truly, when I had lighted both my candles, and taken a good draught\nof ale to refresh me, I perceived that my escape had been marvellous,\nand I knelt down and thanked God for it; though I have never been able,\nas many persons are, to believe myself the main shareholder of Divine\nprotection. A heavy bullet had been fired at me with accuracy\nundeniable. And it must have dropped me as dead as a stone, passing\nupward into my poor brain, if my own good trusty gun had not been on my\nshoulder. Happily for me the lead had struck the lock-plate just above\nthe trigger, and failing to enter the steel of course, had glanced\nupward and passed through the brim of my hat, cutting a groove in the\ncrown as well, but touching never a hair of my head. My right ear was\nred as a radish from the jar of the stock against it, and the spring and\ntumblers of the lock were jammed; but I soon put them to right again.\n\nWhat cowardly and cold-blooded miscreant could thirst for the life of a\nharmless, quiet, and unpretentious fellow thus? No enemy had I, to the\nbest of my knowledge, in all the wide world, for the simple reason that\nI never wronged, insulted, or looked down upon anybody; and whenever I\ncould not get on with a man, I let him go his way, while I went\nmine--unless he brought a pole across my shins; and even then, if he was\nsorry, I forgave him. But one thing was very clear to my mind, when I\nhad lighted an eager pipe, and dwelt on it (sliding along the gentle\nslope, where a blue cloud routs black vapours), that no Englishman ever\nwould have crawled like that, to pot a brother Englishman.\n\nThen I thought of the sneaking shot from the gun of Rakhan which had\nkilled S\u00c3\u00bbr Dadian, when he was returning full of joy to his ancestral\ncastle; and the thing became almost as plain to me as if the sunlight\nhad been poured on it. Captain Strogue would never have done it; a bravo\nhe might be, but not a Thug--if there is any meaning in any man's eyes.\nBut the tall dark fellow, that son of Rakhan who would not come up to\nlook at me, Hafer, who was come to fetch S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, he was the miscreant\nwho tried to shoot me.\n\nSometimes I have a deep vein of discretion, though nobody else perceives\nit, and I always feel myself below my proper level, when I work it. But\na man who has just escaped foul murder by a hair's breadth, and may meet\nthe like to-morrow with the turn of the hair against him, must--unless\nhe is weary of his life--take some thought of his actions. And I felt by\nno means weary of my life, but kindly and warmly in love with it, when\ncertain glances made it sparkle, like a dewdrop in the morning. Not a\nword must I say to any one about that dastardly attempt, unless it were\nto the faithful Stepan, who might cast some light upon it. He had warned\nme; perhaps he knew that some one longed to do away with me. He would\ntake it as the natural outcome of my intimacy at the camp; and now he\napproved of \"milord's\" suit, and urged him to put more steam on.\nProbably he knew why those two villains had lain in wait for poor Allai,\nand were trying by torture to make a traitor of him. And Stepan had\nclearly some reason of his own for keeping his master in the dark about\nit. Moreover, he was struggling with the English language, manifestly\nfor my benefit. With this resolution I went to bed, and dreamed neither\nof thickets, nor bullets, nor bravoes, nor anything else that was nasty;\nbut only of sweet Dariel singing the song of the stork like a\nnightingale, and coming with white wings to my window, where I caught\nher with a pair of reins.\n\nBy this time Grace was in such a state of mind about her noble\nstockbroker, that brother George might have fifty holes in his hat, or\nin his head almost, without the loving sister coming to brush, or darn,\nor even poultice them. Of this I made no grievance, but went so far as\nto be unaware of it; and when her conscience began to work, I showed her\nthat I had bought a thimble, and she called me a heartless molly-coddle.\n\"Never mind. There are better girls than you who can appreciate me,\" I\nanswered with a superior smile, and she flew into a passion. Such is\nfeminine jealousy. They want to love some new-comer better, yet we are\nnot to know it, or to feel the difference.\n\nMost heartily I wished poor Jackson Stoneman only half as good a bargain\nas he fancied he had made of it; for the blindness of a man in love is\nto others quite ridiculous. And I knew that although Grace was blessed\nwith many of the merits he had inspired her with, no one else could\nthink her fit to hold a candle to Dariel. Yet for the world I did not\nwish to hear any one praise my darling, unless it were her father or\nmyself; for it was our business only.\n\nUpon my way to the sacred place where my destiny was to be settled,\nbeing much before my time, and longing to divert my mind (which made my\nlegs feel trembling), I turned aside to search the covert which had so\nnearly proved my doom in the darkness of the night gone by. If I had\nbeen as nervous then as now, nothing could have saved me, for the shock\nof the blow must have thrown me down, and the enemy would have leaped up\nand dispatched me. Even as I had been full of glorious thoughts, and\nstriding in full pride of strength, probably I should have lost my\nbalance, if my left foot had been foremost. And now in the broad\ndaylight I was half afraid to examine the dingle. But I had brought my\ngun, that loyal friend, now as fit for work as ever, and both barrels\nloaded with duck-shot. If that miscreant's gun had been loaded so--but\nthose thundering villains are no sportsmen.\n\nAt once I discovered the place where he had crouched, and a comfortable\nlair he had made of it, less than twelve yards from the path by which\nhe expected me. But the ground being strewn with leaves, wherever it was\nnot covered with grass or tangle, no footprints could be descried,\neither there or further down the dingle; and I was at the point of\nabandoning my search, when a little brown disk, like a piece of stamped\nleather, attracted my attention. It was hanging on some twigs about a\nyard from the ground, in a line between the lurking-place and the spot\nwhere I had been when the bullet staggered me, and at first I took it\nfor a large, thick leaf. And a leaf it was, but not of any tree or shrub\nthat I had ever met with; and I perceived that it was streaked with\nblack, and smelled very strongly of gunpowder. Beyond any doubt, it had\nbeen used as a patch or wrapping for the leaden ball that was meant to\nsend me to another world, and parts of it were scorched or singed by the\nexplosion. I could even see the impress of the iron cap belonging to the\nheavy ramrod, by which it had been driven down the rifle-barrel, and on\nthe other side might be traced the convexity of the bullet which had\nbeen enclosed. What leaf could this be? It was thicker and tougher than\nany English leaf I knew, as well as different in shape and texture.\nTearing a fibre from the cleanest part I laid it on my tongue, and was\nsurprised by a strong and peculiar aroma. After packing it carefully in\na letter from Tom Erricker which happened to be in my pocket, I went on\nmy way towards the ruins of the chapel, having made up my mind to\ninquire at Kew, where I knew a noble botanist, what tree was likely to\nproduce that leathery and spicy foliage.\n\nBut this and every other thought of things around me and of myself were\nfar from any mind of mine,--if mind at all remained to me,--as I sat\nupon an ancient stone begirt with fern and lycopod, and sandalled with\nsoft moss rosetted here and there with ivy braids. All such things are\nsoothing; and there also seemed to be a tranquil air, proceeding from\nthe memory of holy monks, who never pretended to be better than they\nwere, because they saw no need of it. Hereupon I began to fear, as a few\ndead leaves went by me, that I should not have appointed this cold and\nholy spot for speaking of a turbulent affair like love. But, without\nanother word, I was strengthened greatly; the very argument against me\ntook my part. True love is a sacred thing, as the Lord Himself ordained\nit; and a place of ancient reverence, with the sky alone to roof it,\nsuited well for that which is the loftiest of the human state.\n\nPerhaps the maiden had some thoughts a little like my own, but better,\nlarger, and less tumultuous. I was not in a fit condition to know\nexactly what she did; and I even pretended to know less than eyes and\nheart brought home to me. I only knew that she was there, and for a\nlittle time I felt afraid to wish for any more than that.\n\nShe, to my delight and glory, trembled, and tried to look away, as if\nshe shared my fear, but begged me to let it go on a little longer. Then,\nas I caught her hand, and raised it very gently and reverently, good\nmanners compelled her to show surprise, and to cast an inquiring glance\nat me. \"Don't go,\" I said. \"If you only knew--but I never shall be able\nto make you know.\"\n\n\"It would not be right for me to go, when my father ordered me to come.\"\n\n\"Because he knows why. And he gave me leave to say what you know\nalready. Oh, Dariel, what is the good of talking? You know all about it.\nEver since that blessed moment, when I first caught sight of you----\"\n\n\"Through the bushes and across the water? Or was it when you saved\n_Kuban's_ life?\" She looked at me very gravely, as if the time made all\nthe difference.\n\n\"Both, both; and a thousand times since. And it must go on for ever. You\ncan't understand it; of course you can't. But I can understand nothing\nelse. Oh, Dariel, don't be hard upon me. I know that you are the wonder\nof the world, and that I am nothing but a very common fellow, not half\nso worthy to look at you as the short-eared owls in your ivy----\"\n\n\"I am very fond of owls,\" said Dariel; \"they are the wisest of all\nbirds. But I never saw them sit and look at me.\"\n\n\"Then they are fools, and I'll do it for them for ever. But oh, if I\ncould only make you see for a moment how I love you! Don't laugh at me,\nDariel. Don't do that.\"\n\n\"I am sure that I never laughed at all. How can you think that I would\nbe so wicked? But I will confess, if that will be quite sufficient,\nthat I think--that I have been persuaded considerably, Mr. Cranleigh,\nthat you--that you like me.\"\n\n\"Like you, Dariel! what a wretched word! Can you look at me, and fancy\nit no more than that?\" But she would not be taken at any disadvantage;\nthough she turned one ear towards me a little--as if ears could hold no\nagency for heart or lips or eyes.\n\n\"Now listen to me for a moment,\" I said, creeping close to that ear,\nwhich was a masterpiece of shell-work, and filigree curves, and chasing;\n\"tell me--just say--have a little kindness, say whether you think you\ncould ever like me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will say; I will not conceal. I think that I could like you very\nwell; because--because----\"\n\n\"Because what, Dariel? That I may do it again, and go on doing it for\never.\"\n\n\"Because, because--it is just for this reason,\" all the glory of her\neyes flashed on me, \"because you are so much afraid of me.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" In a moment she was in my arms, and I had the sweetest revenge\never known for an imputation of cowardice. And she, whether carried away\nby my love, or by her own sweet gratitude, looked at me with a glow of\nlight, like the gates of heaven opening, and drew me into fresh ecstasy,\nand whispered, \"Do you love me?\"\n\nSuch a time is the date of life, for ever to be dwelt upon; but never\nspoken of, unless it be with the only one who shared it. And I would\nnever have touched upon it, but left all those to take it home, who in\ntheir time have been so blessed; unless I were bound to let them see how\nmuch I had to go upon, in my obstinacy afterwards. Dariel loved me! Who\nwas I, to be rapt by such a miracle? And who of mankind should take it\nfrom me, as long as the heavens continued?\n\n\"Let us kneel, and thank the Lord,\" my darling said, with coy reproach\nof my impetuous transport; \"here where first you saw me, George. If He\nhas meant us for one another, He will be vexed if we do not thank Him.\"\n\nI followed her to the place that once had been of holy rite, and there\nshe took my hand, and knelt upon the plinth of the old sanctuary, and\nmade the sign of the Cross upon her breast and forehead, and spoke some\nwords in some sweet language, and then arose and offered me both hands,\nand I kissed her lovely brow, and met her loving eyes bedewed with\ntears, and said, \"You are mine for ever.\"\n\nShe bowed her head, as if to say, \"I am well contented with it;\" but\nwhen I drew forth that ruby cross of hers which I had kept so long, and\noffered to place it on her breast, as it was when I first beheld her,\nshe shrank away, and her cheeks grew pale, and she trembled so that I\nfelt compelled to throw both arms around her. \"What is it, my darling?\nMy own love, what has scared you so?\" I asked, drawing the red flash\nfrom her sight.\n\n\"You know that I am not too wise. You do not want me to be wise; oh,\nGeorge, I have no strength of mind; I cannot bear to be taken from you.\"\n\n\"I should like to see anybody do it,\" said I, guiding her craftily to a\nless exalted place; \"but why has this little thing frightened you so,\nwhen you must have worn it a hundred times?\"\n\n\"Because there is a most sad tale about it, which I will tell you some\nday. But even without that I must not wear it, according to the rules of\nthe family; unless--unless--a thing that would grieve you heartily, I\nhope, George--unless I cease to care for you. No maiden must have this\non her heart, when her heart has ceased to be her own. Shall I tell you\na little secret? That was why I lent it to you and never asked for it\nback again, as soon as ever I began to fancy--not to be too sure--but to\nbe uncertain whether--oh, you know my signification, George!\"\n\n\"When you doubted, sweetest sweet, whether you might not be beginning to\nthink in your angelic heart of a worthless fellow, whose name is\nGeorge.\"\n\n\"What language to use of such a pair! If you abuse one, you abuse the\nother. Do you see what English I speak now? I could not talk like this,\nwhen first I met you. How do you think I learned to do it?\"\n\n\"Dariel, how should I know? Your voice would make any language sweet.\nYour father has the gift of tongues. He speaks better English than I\ndo. No doubt it has come down to you. And you have been with English\nteachers.\"\n\n\"Yes. But they made me speak French more than this. They thought that\nthe air would teach me English. And my father always talked to me in our\nown language, such as I sang to you last night. But when I began to have\nGeorge in my mind, and to fancy that he was getting fond of me, I\nchanged all that. Comprehend you now? I made my darling father speak\nnothing to me but the English. And I shall be angry with myself, if you\nhave not observed the improvement.\"\n\nAt this proof of her lovely love, I said and did--no matter what. Never\nsince the world began has any man been so beyond himself. Such things\nare not to be described. And I never would have gone back thus, to give\nany one else an idea of them, if I could have won that glory, with no\nanguish afterwards. Every man must be in glory, when his true love loves\nhim. He knows that he is not worthy of it; and that makes the triumph\nnobler.\n\nShe might lead me where she liked. A man is never like a flower--unless\nit be a tobacco-flower, which only blooms in the evening--but he has\nalways been like grass; and grass (if you watch it carefully, and mow it\nvery seldom) has a gift of turning to the sun, like most of us who\nmanage it. My sense of beauty was so vast that I could not get to the\nend of it, and strove to teach her every item of her own perfections.\nBut she arose, and took my hand, and said, \"Let us go to father. A\nlittle bit of wisdom will be good among all these wonders. But I only\nwish that I owned them all; because they would all belong to you.\"\n\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar received us with a loving smile. I thought that he had never\nlooked more grand. Dariel knelt to him, while I held her hand; and if I\ncould have knelt to any man, I would have done so then to him. But the\nknee of an Englishman goes down to none except his Maker.\n\n[Illustration: \"_S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar received us with a loving smile._\"]\n\n\"So be it,\" he said, as he kissed her forehead; \"may the Lord bless both\nmy children.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nA RACE OF PLATERS\n\n\nOf the 26,250 days (which, after due allowance made for the little\njangles of the sun and moon, are the up-cast of our living-time\naccording to the wise man) that sage complains that no one produces\nanything exactly like the produce of its brother one day old. If it were\nso in the almanac of Solon, what can be expected now, when every day is\nsupposed to achieve a long stride in advance of all previous ages,\nclapping their laurels on its own pert head? So have I seen a pretty\nlittle dear, with her hair upon her shoulders, dash out in front of the\nvillage mile-race, at half a skip from the winning-post, and scream out,\n\"I have won it.\"\n\nTo me, in my quiet slow-go pace, it would have been more than enough, if\nthe morrow had been content with its yesterday, and backed it up in a\nfriendly style. But instead of that, it only cared to indorse the safe\ncorollary--\"All in all, a human creature is nothing more than accident.\"\nAccident to wit, just out of luck, according to the word there used,\nwhich bears no merry meaning. Perhaps this on the whole was my disgrace;\nfor a friend's good luck should be one's own.\n\nBut could I put Tom Erricker in the most romantic scale of friendship\n(such as the Romans cultivated) against the heavenly Dariel? Those\nTusculans knew not such love as ours; because they had no such girls to\nlove. However, let Tom have his say.\n\n\n     \"BELOVED GEORGE,--You are my best friend, the only one that\n     understands me, in this smiling vale of tears. You may not have\n     heard from me for some months, because I have had the finest\n     shooting I have ever yet been blest with. It makes one despise all\n     the partridges and pheasants, tame fowl of a lower order. Grouse,\n     my dear boy, and blackcocks too, and we heard of capercailzie! Tell\n     old Stocks and Stones, who was so stingy about his rabbits, that I\n     blow my nail at him, as the poet says. But that is not half of it.\n     The grub--the grub--George, you never came across the like. I am\n     seven pounds heavier than when I came down, in spite of walking off\n     two pounds per diem. The wind seems to blow it back into you. And\n     you make it up at dinner-time; and then you have cigars, such as\n     you never put between your teeth; and then half-a-dozen lovely\n     girls, all ready to scratch one another's faces, to draw you for\n     their pal at billiards. And did not I show them a dodge or two?\n\n     \"But that reminds me that I had my choice; and I chose like the man\n     who put the broom across the walk. I might have had beauty; I might\n     have had fashion; I might have had wit, though I hate it in a girl,\n     because they soon give you the worst of it. And I might have had\n     noble birth; but that would never do, because she might be nasty\n     about the forks and spoons, at the height of the most festive\n     enterprise. She was very sweet upon me for as much as three days;\n     and my aunt, who has \u00c2\u00a380,000 to leave, was wild to have a Lady\n     Frances Erricker. But my Lady Fanny made a wicked slip about the\n     new process, that the Governor has given five pounds for, and\n     expects to clear five thousand by it; and it was all over with her\n     chance. She repented with many tears, and I forgave her, but could\n     not see my way to put her on again; for her outside value was about\n     a thou.; and she would cost more per ann. than that to keep.\n\n     \"Well, I was just putting on my blinkers for another trot in single\n     harness, when a little thing comes round my nose, and looks at me,\n     and strokes my ears, and, by Jove, it was all up with me. Oh, she\n     is such a little Venus, George! Small, as all the true sort are;\n     but no mistake about her. Every time you look at her, you say to\n     yourself--This is a girl; not an Amazon, nor an owl, nor an\n     owl-faced Athen\u00c3\u00a8, nor even the one who changed her sex, every time\n     she struck a serpent. I may be wrong about that; never mind, my\n     Loo will never want to be a Louis. In plain unvarnished fact, she\n     is a duck, and that is what you want of them. Swans are not for me,\n     nor eagles, least of all a cormorant. Her sweet name is Louisa Box;\n     and I said a pretty thing to her. You know my little knack that\n     way. I said, 'Loo Box, you have boxed my compass, and fetched it\n     all to looward.' She could not quite take in my point, for no girl\n     ever knows north from south; but she said, 'Oh, Tom, you are so\n     clever!' while some of them would have boxed my ears; and Lady\n     Fanny longed to do it.\n\n     \"To cut a delicious tale too short, Louisa Box--who has \u00c2\u00a320,000 on\n     the nail, which is not to be sneezed at, with tin going down--and\n     Thomas Erricker, of Middle Temple, are to be joined in holy\n     matrimony, at 11 A. M. next Saturday, and the devil take the\n     hindmost. I have been up to London for new togs, but could not get\n     an hour to run down to you, and I know what a rumpus you are always\n     in. This you will excuse of course. But I rely upon you, mind (and\n     if you fail me it will not come off), to put yourself into your\n     best array, and be best man on Saturday. You must come by the train\n     which reaches Sheffield, 7.45 P. M. on Friday. I will meet you at\n     the station, and we will have a blow-out at the Governor's, and I\n     will put you up to everything. And it would be kind if you would\n     call at old Puckerpant's before you start, and bring my vestments\n     with you. I have paid his bill; so that you can swear at him.\n\n     \"Now, my dear fellow, this is a solemn matter. I feel the vitality\n     of holy matrimony; and I trust my old pal to back me up. Last night\n     I had a spasm in the plaster on my chest. I am not so strong as I\n     was at College, and I shall never pull through it without you. You\n     are a sneak, if you desert the Tom who has done so much for you.\"\n\n\nAny one of lofty altruistic soul, or even decent fidelity, would vote me\na very paltry fellow, for doubting what to do in a case like this. It\nseemed an atrocious thing of Tom, and a pestilent piece of luck for me,\nto take me two hundred miles from home, at this very crisis of my\nlife,--just when I meant to compel my father to call upon S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar; or\nif that could not be done, to bring sweet Dariel to see my mother, whose\nkind heart she would captivate. Then I would show her to Grace, and\nperhaps at some leisure to Jackson Stoneman; and look what becomes of\ntheir pride and their Saxon infatuation, after that! Was this and every\nother delightful plan to be put off, nobody knew how long, for the sake\nof a headlong cash and love-affair concocted by Tom Erricker? I was sure\nthat my sister would agree with me, for she always had made light of\nTom, and I vowed to my reluctant self, that the decision should be left\nto her. What then was my chagrin and wonder, when she said, \"You are\nbound to go, George!\" And I fear that she wanted me out of the way,\nbecause I would not kow-tow to her \"Jack!\"\n\nThe terrible results of this sudden start have strengthened me for ever\nin my solid judgment, which for the moment I was much inclined to\nslacken under the arch spell of St. Winifred. Listen deferentially to\nfeminine opinion, but never let it go beyond your ears; until you have a\ngood wife of your own. She will know how you look at things, and shape\nher wisdom to suit yours, and go beyond your own conviction in the\ncertainty that you are right. And then she knows that she has done it\nall, whenever everything turns out well. But if, peradventure, it all\ngoes amiss, she is the last one in the world to make it bad for you. It\nis your place then to take the blame on your own clumsy shoulders, and\nthink scorn of outside results, while you have one true breast to\ncomfort you.\n\nThese thoughts were far beyond me yet; for a young man believes himself\nwondrous clever, and airs his conclusions about womankind, as a boy\nblows his bubble, or a child upon the grass his ball of dandelion-seed.\nAnd this was just the very thing Tom Erricker had always done; and I had\nthought it very fine, until I met my Dariel. But now I felt disgusted\nwith him, and his Loo of \u00c2\u00a320,000 and all that snobbish frippery about\nhis togs. However, I must make the best of that and him.\n\nTo the life of my life I sent a line, as full of love as I could make\nit, with any room for common-sense behind. And then off I set for all\nthat humbug, show, and sham, and breakfast-speeches, women up to date\nwith tears, and men beyond it with champagne, lovely bride with lips\ntoo sweet for margarine to melt inside them, bridegroom in tepid waxwork\nform, and looking for courage to his mother, whose mind dwells over his\nweaning.\n\nAll this was there, and a great deal more; and it seemed to me that my\ndear friend (who had lost his wit, and his wits as well) deserved our\nfinest sympathies; though the girl was a harmless and good little thing,\nwho wondered how her Tom could have thought so much of me.\n\nBut if ever there were kind and warm people on the face of this\ncold-complexioned earth, these Yorkshire folk might fairly claim the\nwarmest place among them. Not for hospitality alone (though in that they\nwere beyond abundance) but also for solid good-will without sham, and a\nhearty power of liking any one who met them frankly. There was something\nabout them altogether different from our Southern style; stronger and\ndeeper, and more true in the way they stuck to what they said. Also I\nfound them very eager to have large and liberal views of their own in\nabstract questions of politics; and if they made mistakes, it was--so\nfar as I could follow suit--from contempt of shilly-shallying. I went\namong them, with the tags of my Tory armour tied, hooked with steel I\nought to say; and though they could not pull any of it off, they made\nthe whole suit more flexible, and airy, and elastic.\n\nAlas, that I had so brief a chance of expanding under the broadcloth!\nNone of them could unsettle me in what I was brought up to. But having\nan equitable mind, and being worsted generally in argument, I began to\nsee that the strongest principles may go too far in their own strength.\nThere was one old man of mighty aspect, and immense benevolence, who\nmust have brought me beneath his mantle, in three more nights of looking\nat me. I felt his influence, and feel it now.\n\nBut whether for any good or harm, all this was cut short suddenly. After\nTom and his bride were gone, with the usual showers after them, all the\nguests and many more came together at Silver Hall, the abode of the\nancient Tinman, as Tom in his impudence called his father. For why; it\nhad been arranged among them to have the wedding-dance out there, with\nmore room for enjoyment than Sir Benjamin Box could minister. And I was\nbeginning to count my time, for I meant to go by the midnight train; and\nclumsy dancer as I am, there were several very nice girls indeed, who\ndid their best in a charming way to make me do my best as well.\nEspecially there was Tom's younger sister, as pretty a girl as need be\nseen; in a formal mood of the masculine mind, \"Miss Argyrophylla\nErricker.\" Her mother had paid a poor Oxford man a guinea for invention\nof that name; and she was worth it, though everybody called her \"Pilla.\"\n\nIt was a lucky thing for me that I had not seen Pilla too early in life,\nfor I know not where I might have been. This very pretty girl was also\nof a very romantic tendency; which, with a little wit to quicken, and\nsweet brown eyes to sweeten it, stops you, in your course, like a double\nwater-jump with a hurdle of furze between it. You pause to think; and\nyou pause for ever. I had heard of her a hundred times from Tom, but had\nnever imagined that she was so nice; for he spoke of her with that fond\ncondescension which made her look up to him as a mighty hero. And now I\nhad to take care what I said, as she always got back to him at every\nother breath; and a great stretch of verity was needful on my part, to\nrespond to her view of his merits. But this made me like her all the\nmore, and I wished more than once that my sister Grace, who certainly\npossessed much more occasion for it, were gifted with an equal amount of\nthis lovely philadelphia.\n\nHow many times I danced with Pilla is a great deal more than I can say;\nbut it was very far from being to the exclusion of everybody else, as\npeople were found to say afterwards. She, as the daughter of the house,\nwas bound to pay proper attention to the guest who had come so far to\nplease her brother, and would have to leave so early. And, for my part,\nI could not forget the duty of warm friendship to my dear old Tom. Every\ntime she came back to me, I thought that her rich brown eyes grew\nbrighter, and I told her how much they resembled Tom's, although\ninfinitely more expressive. And she found me improving so fast in my\nsteps, which had fallen into sad neglect among the furrows, that I\nfeared to fall off again, if I failed to make the most of so rare a\nchance. But as to making love to her--what love had I to make? All my\nrights and dues of that were signed, sealed, and delivered to another\nlady--of a different grade altogether.\n\nBut away went all a man's thoughts of homage to anything but humanity\nwhen, after I had said \"Good-bye\" to Pilla, and seen my bag come down\nthe stairs, and was casting a wrapper around me, while the cabman\nthumped himself betwixt the doors, the sweet little creature ran up to\nme again and tried to speak, but only mumbled, and would have gone down\nwith her chin upon the floor, if I had not stretched both arms to catch\nher. Upon them she lay, like a lamb upon a rail, with all her body\nquivering, and the helplessness of her slack head thrown against my\ndancing waistcoat.\n\n\"What is it, dear child?\" I asked in vain. All she could do was to\nspread one hand towards a big door; and then that hand fell, and she was\nall long hair and pink muslin. \"Is there a woman here?\" I called out, in\nterror of a fit, as I kept her from the floor; and a woman of great\nsubstance rushed up and caught her, and glared at me, as if I were a\nvillain. \"Poor lamb! Poor darling! The bad wicked man!\" \"Did you see how\nhe swept her off her feet?\" There were half-a-dozen handmaids now; and I\nleft poor Pilla to them.\n\n[Illustration: \"_A woman of great substance rushed up and caught her._\"]\n\nThen seeing how stupidly quick they were, I went to the door she had\npointed at, and with heavy misgivings entered. It was a large high room,\nwith a lot of gilt about it, and gorgeous books sprawling upon stamped\nleather; but the gas was turned down, and the light of the fire\nflickered with gushes of shape and shadow.\n\nThere was another and a darker shadow there. A dead man lay in the deep\ncomposure of a most luxurious chair; his head had fallen back against\nthe rich morocco; and the fire that played on his dull wan eyes should\nwarm no part of him any more,--Theophilus Erricker, a man who had made\nhis fortune, in the rush, and kick, and pell-mell of life--by fair play,\nno doubt, when the rules permitted; and with kindness to his fellows,\nwhen so be it, the facts went the right way for him.\n\nIt was strong hospitality, and quick heart now, which had brought him\nto this sad extreme. Throughout the day, he had been doing too much for\na man of his legs, and years, and weight, as several persons told him.\nBut the old man kept up to the height of young time; and when Sir\nBenjamin Box (an alderman of substantial yet melancholy order) entreated\nhim not to dance so much, stout Mr. Erricker challenged him, though Box\nwas ten years his junior, to jump over a dining-room chair with him! And\nthus he carried on for hour after hour, dancing, and slapping old\nfriends on the back, and running about among the pretty girls, like a\nwaiter who has to subsist upon tips; and ever so much rasher than that\nman is, because he was stirring up his intellect, to the same high scale\nas his body. What wonder then--with his doctor called away to a wealthy\nconfinement, and his good wife too busy to frown at him--that he\nverified the warnings of those who knew, but could not at such a time\nremind him, that he had all but created a vacancy in the Town Council\nlast Easter Monday, through juvenile impetuosity?\n\nWhat an awful crash of buffers, in the midst of headlong gaiety! Even to\nme, so new a friend, it seemed to sweep aside all thoughts of self, and\nplunge it in the great tide of human fate, that pitiless gulf-stream, in\nwhich we cannot even endeavour a course of our own, but are whirled\nalong like a dollop of froth, or a shred of pop-weed among other weeds.\n\nBeing (as a young man ought to be) entirely without experience of the\nsudden tragedies of life, perhaps I overdid my sense of duty in a case\nlike this. If so, I erred on the better side; and in spite of all the\nsad home results I say that I would do the like again, whether others\nwould do as much for me, or not. Right or wrong, I could not bring\nmyself to leave these unhappy people without any friend to help them. My\nservices were but small of course; and yet as it happened there was no\none in the house to be more efficient. The family lawyer had left the\ntown, after seeing to the marriage-settlement; the execution of the will\nwas committed to Tom and his mother. Tom was away on his wedding-trip;\nand his mother, in delicate health for some years, had now broken down\nentirely, and left her daughter to do the best she could. Only on one\npoint the widowed mother still had the courage to insist. Whatever came\nof it, her son should not be called back from his honeymoon to the\ncoffin of his father. He had set off for Italy, or the South of\nFrance--I forgot which it was for the moment--nothing but a telegram\ncould stop him; and no telegram should be sent.\n\nA miserable time it was indeed. The lawyer's junior partner came; but he\nwas a young man without self-reliance, regardful of nothing but legal\nforms, and desirous of nothing but to please Miss Pilla, who could make\na flexible stalactite--if such a thing there be--of him, by every\ncrystal tear; and she having therefore little faith in him, all he did\nwas to cast the burden of every doubtful arrangement upon me.\n\n\"The old man will cut up finely, sir,\" was the most practical of his\nremarks to me; \"no expense must be spared on his funeral. Under the\nwidow's instructions--poor thing! you must now act as quasi-executor.\nThe Corporation will not be pleased, unless everything is carried out\nA1. And if I may venture upon a private sentiment, it will all tell up,\nsir; it will be a sound investment, with an eye to the welfare of the\nbusiness.\"\n\nThen Sir Benjamin Box came in, and put his hat upon the very chair in\nwhich the Master of the house had breathed his last, and spake below\nbreath impressively.\n\n\"Saddest thing I ever knew, in all my life! We shall never look upon his\nlike again. My dear Sir George, what a lesson for us! But to jump over\nchairs, at his time of life! And eighteen stone, if he weighed an ounce.\nI, who am comparatively active--but we will not reproach him, when he\ncannot reply. Fine thing for Tom though; can you give me an idea? You\nare the acting Executor, I believe.\"\n\n\"I am not an Executor at all, Sir Benjamin. And I am no Sir George, but\nplain George Cranleigh. I am doing what little I can, at the request of\nthe ladies, and their lawyer. But you are more nearly connected, and if\nyou would only take it off my hands----\"\n\n\"No, no, thank you. That wouldn't do at all. I never could stand a house\nof mourning. My own heart is ticklish; this has given me quite a turn.\nBut you are young, sir, you are young. My deepest sympathies to the\nafflicted ladies.\"\n\nHe was off with so light a foot, that even the ghost of the poor\ndeceased would have found itself too heavy, if it ever came to finish\nthe jumping-match. And then Argyrophylla glided in, looking like a\nsilver aspen leaf in a coil of black ivy, as she took my hand.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. George, what a hateful old man! I heard what he said, and I saw\nhim run away. And my brother has married his daughter! Cowards, how they\nfly at the very thought of death; and when their time of life should\nmake them so glad to know more about it! But you are not like that, are\nyou? Though it must be most sadly distressing for you. To attempt to\nthank you would be so absurd and hopeless. How proud my brother must be\nof such a friend! If I live to be eighty, I shall never forget you. But\nI came to tell you two pieces of good news, if there can be such a thing\nas good news now. Dr. Golightly has called upon the Coroner, and got him\nto dispense with an Inquest, as the case had been medically treated\nbefore. And then Aunt Gertrude is coming to-morrow, and she will bring\nSelina Petheril, who was at our school at Brompton.\"\n\nOf Selina Petheril I knew nothing, but this Aunt Gertrude was the\nrelative from whom Tom had great expectations; and her arrival made\nthings much better, and relieved me of some anxiety. She approved of all\nthat I had done; but I found it impossible to leave the house with any\nsecurity that all was right, until the third day after the funeral. I\nhad written to my sister, and heard from her once or twice, so that\nthere could be no uneasiness at home. But of my dear friends in the\nvalley not a word had reached me, though among all those dismal duties\nmy thoughts had been with them constantly.\n\nIt is not for me to pretend to say whether I acted well or ill. But to\none thing I can pledge my honour, that no small motive and no tender\nclaims of beauty in distress detained me. If Pilla had been the plainest\ngirl in the county of many acres, my behaviour would have been just the\nsame. I never said a word to her that was not of the purest pity and\ngood feeling; neither did she think twice of me, except as a willing and\nwarm friend. There is nothing in me to attract any girl; and even if\nthere were, any man who imagines that a loving daughter in deep\naffliction would set up a flirtation with a stranger, the same is a bad\nman, and proves it by measuring women by his own low mark.\n\nHowever, no more of that. Enough that when we heard by telegram that Tom\nwould be at home that night, I took the mail-train to London, and got\nhome at breakfast-time on Sunday morning, having thus been absent just\nnine days.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nGONE, GONE, GONE\n\n\nA small and well-measured breakfast-party, with the tea and the bacon\nand eggs provided, to expectation and experience, should not be\ndisturbed by the sudden irruption of a rough, unshaven, crumple-shirted,\nand worst of all, unfed young fellow, who cannot remember when his last\nmeal happened. Therefore I only sent word of my arrival, and went for a\nswim in Stoneman's lake, as my custom was throughout the year, while\nSally was preparing me some bread and milk. But while I was getting\nthrough this, and thinking of putting myself into church-going gear, my\nsister Grace ran in, and embraced me, as warmly as if I were on the\nStock Exchange.\n\n\"Oh, George, I think you are so noble,\" she declared, as if she had\nfound me at last too large for her understanding, \"to stay away so many\nweeks\"--I had not been away for a week and a half, but let her have a\ngirl's arithmetic--\"simply for the sake of other people's affairs,\nwithout even appointing anybody to look after your own, all that long\nwhile. I thought that I was almost as unselfish as anybody ought to be.\nBut I am not sure that I could quite have done all that.\"\n\n\"You don't understand things, my dear girl,\" I replied, with that\nsuperior tone which used to have a fine effect of closure upon the large\nfeminine parlance. \"I knew that hay was going up, and that Mr. Joplin\nwould have to put five shillings on to every pound he offered me in\nOctober.\"\n\n\"Hay indeed!\" she exclaimed with scorn. \"George, it is sweet hay--sweet\nhay--sour hay! And you have not made it, while the sun shone.\"\n\n\"Speak no more in parables. Speak plain English. What in common-sense\nare you driving at? There is no hay in the county to beat ours. And I\ndefy any rain to have got into the ricks.\"\n\n\"But suppose the ricks are all clean gone. Oh, George, how stupid you\nare at metaphors! But if they are gone, without letting you know--oh, I\nnever could believe that, of foreigners even! And after all the great\nthings you have felt for such great people!\"\n\n\"Out with it!\" I said, while my spoon went dribbling. \"You mean to tell\nme, I suppose, if plain English can ever be got from a girl, that S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar, and his people, have left the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"His people indeed! Well, if you can take it in that lofty spirit, you\nmay as well know everything. I was quite afraid of telling you. But men\nare all alike, at least old Sally says so--though what she can know\nabout it, the poor old soul----\"\n\n\"When did it happen?\" I asked quite calmly, for I wanted no pity about\nit; least of all from a girl who had never entered into any proper view\nof the question, because I never chose to run and gush to her.\n\n\"That is more than we can tell. They must have packed up very quickly,\nunless they left all their dogs and diamonds behind them. But we only\nheard of it yesterday, through Slemmick, who had it from Farmer Ticknor.\nThat seems a little rude, considering that you were to have taken me\ndown so soon, to fall at the feet of the Lesghian Bandit. But of course\nwe must not judge them by our own ideas. Perhaps, as we had never called\nupon them----\"\n\n\"They would not have troubled their heads about that. They look at\nthings from a higher level. But perhaps they might have sent a boy to\ntell me, if they had found any time to spare. My dear child, in a\nquarter of an hour I shall be ready; and then we will go to church\ntogether.\"\n\nLet any man tell me what else he would have done, and I shall be much\nobliged to him. Not that it could help me very much, for such a thing\ncan scarcely happen twice to any fellow; but that I should like to\ncompare his view of it with what went on in my own mind. Nothing is\neasier than to talk, when you see the thing a long way off, or (which is\neven better) only read about it, or give a bold verdict without a\nglance; which is the wisest course of all.\n\nAll that I can say about my part, is that reason did not count for a\nhalfpenny in the business. Pride (which is often a matter of temper, or\nself-esteem set up to crow, but when it arises in a modest nature is the\nproper power to keep it sweet)--pride said to me: \"I am well aware that\nyou never stuck up for being humble. You hate any fellow that goes in\nfor that, because you believe him a hypocrite. And so he is, ninety-nine\ntimes per cent; the one per cent being a true Christian, a quantity\naltogether negligible. You are not up to that mark. But you are a\nself-respecting Englishman. Show it, my fine fellow, by whistling at\npeople, who have not known you better than to snub you.\"\n\nI listened to this, and it all seemed true, as beyond all doubt it ought\nto be. And I went through everything so well that Grace (who was\nwatching me with tender interest, to learn perhaps how the Stockbroker\nwould take it if she vanished out of his investments) did her best to be\npleased for my dear sake; and yet for joint-stock sake afforded me as\ncold a kiss, when she said good-night, as any man insisting on the\nabstract woman can hope to receive from the concrete.\n\nThis alone was enough to show me that I was on the wrong tack\naltogether. Women are delightful in their talk, if nobody contradicts\nthem, about their finer nature, and purer standard, and higher mission\nto ennoble us. All this we acknowledge, and should feel it more if they\nsaid less concerning it. But the worst of it is, that if any man regards\nthem as they demand to be regarded, he may stand with his back to the\nwall while they go by.\n\nNow a man, however dull-witted he may be, has sense enough to know that\nin any nice point touching his behaviour to the better half of life, a\nmember of that half can show him what to do far better than he can\ndiscover it. Nothing could be clearer than that Grace despised the\nhaughtiness and the hardness which she herself would have shown in her\nown case. \"How her eyes would have flashed!\" thought I--and then came a\nvision of other eyes, gentle, true, deep-hearted eyes, sad with some\ndark mystery perhaps, compelled to keep their tears unseen; but\nwavering, jiltish, deceitful--never. And then I began to recall her\nkindly, and found it very comforting.\n\nFor when the sweet face came before me, with the soft radiance of those\neyes, and the play of those lips that trembled lest they should open\nthemselves unduly, and the movement of a heart that wondered whether it\nwanted itself to be understood, and a multitude of other little\nwaverings which a man is too dull to interpret,--when all this came home\nto me with unknown power (because I wanted it and nothing else)--\n\n\"Away with this stupid pride!\" said Love, clinging to my breast, and\nwhispering; \"the Power that made mankind made me, and ordered me never\nto be far off in the worst of your tribulations. But I must have faith,\nas even He requires in all His dealings with you. I have offered you as\nfair a chance as ever was given to a clumsy mortal,--the loveliest\ncreature, a child of my own, as much too good for you as I am. Because\nthe Wicked One has raised a mist, in his loathing of human happiness,\nare you fool enough to be untrue to me, and shut your blear eyes, and\nnever open them, until nothing is left worth looking at? Go your own\nway. I have plenty of finer fellows to stand by me.\"\n\nThough he may not have said it so distinctly--and he is not the fellow\nanyhow that should talk about a mist--it produced the same effect upon\nme. I felt myself, after a little thinking, very many cuts above Jackson\nStoneman and his slippery stuff among the pats of butter. His love was\nas sound as a roach, and as merry as a grig; and he was welcome to it: a\nthing like a bleak that flits under a film of the water, and jumps at a\nmidget, and so becomes fit to make pearl of Paris.\n\nWhen the striking-weight of a clock is too heavy, it slurs the hours\nwith such a tug that you cannot even count the strokes; and to me, with\nthat heavy weight upon my heart, time went by untimely: slowly, heavily,\nand sluggishly, if ever I began to count the ticks; but out of all\nproper chronology, at periods when I kept no eye upon it. Moreover, I\nhad a number of little things to see to, which had been neglected in my\nabsence, so that it was Tuesday afternoon when I stood at the door of\nSt. Winifred, and wondered whether she had fallen back into rust and\nruin once again. The old wall fringed with ivy looked like a billow with\na ruffled crest before the white comb breaks from it, and the slumber of\nthe valley was not shaken by groan or shudder of the water-wheel. No\nsmoke was rising from the buttressed chimneys which had been repaired\nand pointed, neither was there any sign of life, or sound of the harsh\nCaucasian gabble in which many idle souls delighted.\n\nIn short, the settlement (which had been so long the puzzle of the\nneighbourhood, and the blessing of the rate-collectors, for S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar\npaid always every penny put upon him) was gone, vanished, a vision of\nthe distance; a pleasant resource for the memory, when not too\nconceptive at dinner-time; a fact that would fade into a legend soon,\nand find matter-of-fact disproving it.\n\nIf I had not been reduced by this time to a meritorious humility--which\nI meant to keep up, let it suffer as it might--it would have gone hard\nwith our language to forego one of its strongest and briefest words,\nwhich the weaker tongues try to pronounce against us, but condemn\nthemselves by the effort. Being of the purest English birth, and\ntherefore (as even our enemies admit) an embodiment of justice, I stood\nstill, and made allowance for all of lesser privilege. They have quite\nas much right to their own ideas as the largest of us have to ours. And\nit is our power of perceiving that which has made us beloved throughout\nthe world, or at least by as many as can understand us. Or if they be\nfew, whose fault is that?\n\nWhile I was full of these quick thoughts, and exceedingly sorrowful over\nthem, lo, two streaks of yellow on the dark-green grass, and the\nself-possession of Albion was wellnigh rolled over in its own tricks.\n_Kuban_ and _Orla_, as mad as March hares, threw all their wild welcome\nupon me: kisses, and licks, and the hairiest embraces, and the most\nlunatic yells of delight; if ever there has been true love, here was the\nprime of it to knock me off my legs.\n\nAny one may laugh at me and all my pride; for the whole of it went to\nthe dogs in a jiffy. I am blest if I could help a gleam of moisture that\nmade it difficult for me to see the loyal love in eyes that never told a\nlie. \"You dears!\" I cried, \"you faithful dears!\" and they would scarcely\nlet me say it before they were smothering me again, and then they rolled\non the ground as if they had got no legs, and then they jumped up and\nlooked at one another to be certain of their facts; and then with one\naccord they made the valley ring with glorious shouts of joy, and the\ndead leaves tremble on the lonely trees. And behold, they had roused a\ngreat figure of a man, who came from a door where I had trembled like a\nleaf, and put his hand over his eyes, and gazed at me, as if he had\nnever seen a man before. And then a little figure ran almost between his\nlegs, and I halloed to Stepan and Allai.\n\nStepan showed a warm desire to embrace me, which proved that to him I\nwas guiltless as yet, while Allai put both hands on his head, and bowed\nalmost to my gaiters. Now if I could only make these fellows understand,\nand then get them to do the like to me, I should learn all about this\nsudden flitting, for the smallest of the Lesghians had always seemed to\nbe in partnership with the greatest.\n\nBut alas! what a conflict of languages we had! I think it is St. James\nwho dwells with great eloquence upon the many miseries we suffer from\nthe tongue; he has not, however, described for us one of its most\ndiabolical conditions, when it cannot hit upon the word it wants, and\nflies into a fury of perplexity with itself, and indignation at the\nstupid ear that keeps it so in limbo. Stepan tried English, and that was\nvery bad; then I tried Lesghian, but that was much worse. He could see\nthat I wanted to know why his master had broken up their English home so\nsuddenly, and without so much as a word of farewell; but all that he\ncould do towards telling me was to shake his head, and make a great\nnoise in his throat, and box the boy's ears for laughing at him. Then\nsomething not altogether devoid of true insight occurred to him, for he\nshouted in a mighty voice, \"Stepan dam fool!\" and gave Allai some order,\nwhich sent him to the buildings like an arrow.\n\nSomething had occurred to me also, so often are ideas simultaneous, and\nwhile the messenger was gone, I took that leaf of which I have spoken,\nfrom my pocket-book, and handed it to Stepan. He looked at it with great\nsurprise, and then put it to his lips and on his forehead, and then tore\noff a fibre and tasted it. \"Adul! Adul!\" or some word that sounded like\nthat, he repeated frequently, and did his utmost to show me that he felt\ngreat curiosity about it. Upon this I pulled out a pencil and drew a\nrough sketch of myself being shot at, taking poetic licence to show the\nbullet in the air and the leaf dropping from it. Also I tried to\nrepresent a man crouching in a bush and popping at me, and although not\na glimpse had been vouchsafed me of the villain on that occasion, I\nallowed imagination to indue him with the plumed hat of Prince Hafer.\nThis I had no right to do; but surely a little liberty is pardonable\nwith a gentleman who has taken a shot at one in the dark. At any rate\nStepan fell in most briskly with the inference of this costumiery, and\nseemed rather pleased at the confirmation of his own moral estimate and\nforesight.\n\nUntil I began to think, I was surprised that he should be so calm about\nthat black attempt to annihilate me; but remembering what he had been\nthrough, I let him take it according to his nature. He liked me, he\napproved of me, he thought me a good Englishman; and yet it would have\nbeen no more than the finish of a bear-hunt to him to have carried me\nhome on the hurdle I jumped, when I went to the rescue of Allai. And I\nlooked at him, with some disappointment.\n\n\"Enemy!\" he said; it was the word that had long been hanging in his\nwindcrop; and now he was so delighted with it that he said it three\ntimes over. \"Good Englisk; dam enemy. Stepan see all--all right, dam\nenemy!\"\n\nHis wondrous baldric (better smocked with cartridge-loops than a\nparish-clerk could show of plaiting on his Sunday front, in the days\nwhen his wife was proud of him) bulged on his mighty chest with the\nelation of this grand discovery. And then he said, \"Bad man, bad man!\"\nin a manner which appeared to me too abstract and philosophical. \"No\ndoubt you consider it very fine fun,\" I replied with some warmth of\nfeeling, but the knowledge that he was no wiser.\n\nThen up ran Allai, at a speed which made him resemble a hunted\ngrasshopper, and I took from his claws a sealed letter, and looked at\nthem both, in disdain of any hurry. \"This will keep,\" I said very\nquietly; for though they knew not the meaning of my words, they might be\nasked afterwards how I received it, and they should have no flurry to\nreport. So I put it in my pocket, like a Briton.\n\nStepan, and Allai, and one other man not equally well known to me, had\nevidently been left to finish the packing of some of the heavier goods,\nand the bales of books which had been printed, and to take them, as well\nas the beloved dogs, perhaps by some slower route, and rejoin their\nmaster by arrangement. I knew that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had long been preparing to\nmove, when his period of banishment expired, but I was sure that he had\nno intention of departing so suddenly, when I had seen him last. Stepan\ncontrived to let me know that the luggage was going by a smoker in a day\nor two from London pond, as he called it; and having no further business\nthere, I took leave of him and Allai. The Lesghian giant was dignified\nand impressive in his long farewell, and gave me his blessing--as I\nsupposed--and his invitation to the Caucasus. Also this comfort--\"Enemy\ngone. No more shoot good Englisk,\" which was some relief to a heavy\nmind. But little Allai, and the two dogs--I could scarcely get away from\nthem, so loving and so sad were they. The short November day was\ndarkening, as I left the valley, where I had found so much wild\nhappiness, and so much deep sorrow to humble me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nLOVERS MAKE MOAN\n\n\nNow when I had read S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's letter, which I hastened to do by the\nlight from the west at the very spot where he had told his tale, there\nwas nothing (at least to a clay-headed fellow) affording definite answer\nto the questions which concerned me most. The first of these was--why on\nearth had my friends broken up and departed so hastily? And the\nsecond--no less of a puzzle to me--what had I done to give fatal\noffence? All S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar wrote was this, wherein I found that although he\nspoke our language so well and fluently and with better command of it\nthan I have, he was not quite so familiar with the mysteries of our\nspelling. But let that pass unheeded.\n\n\n     MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND,--So I desire to call you still, because I am\n     old, and an old man has learned that he must not listen to\n     everything, neither yield without proof to assertions which\n     contradict his own experience. My belief is that you are as full of\n     honour as I was at your time of life; and it is always most hot in\n     the young, until they are taught that justice is the first thing to\n     be aimed at. And I have a firm belief from my observation of you,\n     that any mistake you may have made was caused by the influence of\n     the moment, and without any intention to do wrong.\n\n     I am grieved that I shall have no opportunity of meeting you again\n     in England. We are obliged to depart at once, having heard of an\n     adverse incident, which threatens all my prospects of success.\n     Probably we shall never meet again; and perhaps you will not desire\n     it. But Englishmen go everywhere, even to the inhospitable\n     Caucasus; and I would try to prove to you that the epithet is\n     undeserved, if you would afford me the chance, and show that you\n     still think kindly of your old friend,\n\n     IMAR, the Lesghian.\n\n\nVexed as I was with painful wonder as to the charge against me, I could\nnot help admiring the large and peaceful nature of this man. He thought\nthat I had wronged his child, the hope of his days, and the heart of his\nlife; and yet not a bitter word did he employ, nor even show a sign of\nscorn. Not in vain had he passed through the mill of tribulation. By\nloss of faith in woman's goodness, he had lost all the delights of love,\nof family bliss, and home, and comfort for the residue of his time on\nearth. And the lesson it had taught him was to doubt of evil in mankind,\nor at least in those whom his friendly nature led him to approve and\nlike. Oh! why was not his daughter of an equal trust and largeness? Not\na word had she sent me, not even one reproach, which might have told me\nthat her heart was sore. If after all her knowledge of me, all the proof\nwhich her eyes alone must have rendered to her mind, one lying tale,\nwhatever it was, had been enough to scatter to the wind all her faith\nand all her love, then none of it was worth having. So I reasoned, and\nyet in vain. The stronger my conviction grew, the less was I convinced\nof it. My heart was all with Dariel still; and let the mind argue as it\nwould, had logic ever looked at her? Any cold dribble may be crystal\nclear; but the current in the veins of man should be warm and red and\nglowing.\n\nUnder that sudden cloud could I rest without looking up to inquire what\nit was? All I could do was to guess and guess; but I had no guilty\nconscience, which is the quickest of all conjecturers. If for one moment\nof charm, or caprice, any lure of the eye, or bewitchment of a smile, I\nhad gone astray from my one true love, the memory would have come up at\nonce, and suggested to my shame that I was served aright. But there had\nbeen nothing of the kind. I had only done what seemed at first the\nsimple duty of friendship, and after that sunk my own delights in the\nstress of deep affliction. If for this, and no more than this, I was to\nbe treated as a scoundrel, I had a right to know who had put that twist\nupon it.\n\nTherefore, on the following day, I took an early train to London, and a\ncab from the terminus to Hatton Garden, and found Signor Nicolo\nfinishing at leisure a delicate and skilful breakfast. He received me\nvery kindly, and unpinned the napkin from his Italian velvet coat, and\noffered me a glass of something fine, which proved a great deal too fine\nfor me. My impatience seemed to please him, and he was in no hurry to\nallay it. And his first words seemed to me to contain some rather\nimpertinent assumption.\n\n\"The great point is to be calm, Mr. Cranleigh. To be quite calm, and\nlook at things quietly--ah, yes!\"\n\n\"I scarcely know what you refer to, Mr. Nickols. What is there to\nprevent my being calm? I am simply come to ask about some friends, as\na--as a matter of business. You were kind enough when I was here\nbefore----\"\n\n\"Come, come now. This won't do. We are not having a deal for a diamond.\nI know all about it, as well almost as if I had been in the thick of it.\nAh, yes! But you find yourself bothered, don't you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I don't like it much,\" I answered, as his black eyes flashed\nat me, and a merry smile lifted his long moustache. \"I did not expect to\nbe treated thus. And I was strongly attached to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar.\"\n\n\"And to _Kuban_ and _Orla_. Ah, yes, I see! And to Stepan and Allai, and\nall the rest. What a pity there were no ladies there! You might have\nbecome attached to them as well.\"\n\n\"I call it very kind of you to spare me so much time,\" I answered rather\nstiffly, for I would have no vulgar chaff about Dariel; \"I was almost\nafraid of encroaching upon business.\"\n\n\"Duke of K---- at eleven o'clock, Serene Highness of L---- at twelve,\nKing of the Malachites at half-past; and a bigger swell than all of them\nput together to a devilled bone at 1.30. Therefore we must touch the\npoint. You want to know why our interesting friends have bolted so\nsuddenly; and still more, why they did it without ta-ta to you. That\nlast point I am not clear about, though I have some shrewd suspicions.\nBut I think I can tell you why they made a brief adieu to the\nneighbours who never came near them. You will acknowledge that they\ncould not be expected to stand on ceremony there.\"\n\n\"You have got the stick by the wrong end altogether,\" I broke in, for\nthe sake of justice; \"we let them alone, for the excellent reason that\nwe knew they wished to be let alone. No Englishman ever endeavours to\npush through a gate that is always bolted. Our neighbourhood took no\nnotice of them, because it was known from the very first that they came\nthere for that purpose. And living in a wilderness of ivied ruins----\"\n\n\"You appear to have turned against them, even more than their behaviour\nwarrants. But for all that, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar is a really great man. He looks at\nthings differently from you and me; and it is not for us to judge him.\nFor, like all men who go in for what we don't care about, he is set down\nas a crank, a dreamer, a man with a tile off, a fellow you would like to\ntoss for sovereigns with, and everything else that a cad of the gutter\npities and sucks up to. But I can tell you that the Lesghian old man, as\nthe idiots would call him at forty-five, may defy a Polish Jew to cheat\nhim. For I don't call it cheating a man, when he knows it, and lets you\ndo it, because he scorns you and the cash alike. When you cheat him you\nare like a man who steals his house-water from a horse-trough, and you\ndeserve to get glanders for it. But what I call fine cheating is to get\ntwice the value of a thing out of a wiry old screw, whose money is his\nlife, and his life all money. Oh, yes! There is some joy in that.\"\n\nSignor Nicolo rubbed his hands, and then put them into the feeling of\nhis pockets, with a warmth of some rich memory--not very old, I daresay.\n\n\"But you would never do such a thing as that?\" I asked, with a little\ndoubt quivering in the question. \"You would be far above all such\nideas?\"\n\n\"Would I? Of course I would, when I couldn't get the chance. And I would\nnever get the better of a real friend, beyond twenty-five per cent at\nmaximum. And he would make seventy-five on that at the West End. But\nwhen a man I hate with a fine religious strength, comes here to get the\nbest of me, screwing up his mouth, and looking righteous, and as\ncordial as a stewed Spanish onion--'oh, dear, how lovely! A little flat\nin the culet--would be perfect but for that milky spot below the zone,'\nand so on; for what did the Almighty make a man except to chisel such a\ncurmudgeon? Ah, yes, I have done it a hundred times, and hope I may be\nspared to do it a thousand more. It is not for the money, it is the\nintellectual triumph. Everybody knows what I am. Come to me fairly, and\nI treat you fairly. Must have my living wage, of course. But no more,\nunless you try to rob me. Then you have got the wrong pig by the ear.\nAnd it's the very same thing in love, Mr. Cranleigh. Have you tried to\ntake a rise out of Dariel?\"\n\nThis would have made me very angry with at least nine people out of ten.\nBut I knew that I had a queer character to deal with, and that he meant\nno harm, but only to get to the bottom of the matter. So I told him that\nif there was anything of that sort, I thought it was rather the other\nway. And then I was quite in a fury with myself, for putting it as if\nshe could have done a shabby thing. And I praised her ninefold, and\ncould have gone on for an hour.\n\n\"You are all right,\" he said, \"that is clear enough; you are as\ninfatuated as a Goddess could require. We have all been so, some time or\nother. But you should have seen her mother, ah, yes, ah, yes! Signora\nNicolo cannot bear to hear her name, though she ought to be grateful,\nfor it kept me good, and plunged me, I do believe, into matrimony. A\nsweet woman never knows the good she does, any more than an impudent\nflippant one can measure her own mischief. For the sake of that noble\nOria, as well as of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, who saved, my life, I would go anywhere\nand do anything, to be of service to Dariel. And for her own sake too, I\ncan tell you, for she is a most charming creature, though a little too\nsoft, like her father. Ah, that's where the mischief will come in! How\ncan you save a man from himself? After all the lies he has suffered\nfrom, and the wreck of his life--I know all about it now, though I\ndidn't when I saw you--would you believe that he is spoonier than ever\nabout doing good to those cursed fellows? Saving their souls! Why,\nthey've got none; or if they have, what are ours to be called? As\ndifferent as quartz from opal, which are much the same thing though in\ndifferent form. And as for their bodies, they are big enough already,\nand dirty enough, and as hard as nails. Let them all kill one another,\nis what the Lord intended, and Nature does her best to help him. Why,\nthe country ought to belong to us; we could do some good with it. It\nshould have been ours long ago.\"\n\n\"No doubt of that,\" I replied, for that seems to be the duty of every\nland; \"I knew that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar meant to go, and for years he has been\npreparing to civilise his people; but what has made him go so suddenly?\"\n\n\"Well, I think it was through a tall young fellow, who has been prowling\nabout for a long time. 'Prince Hafer' he calls himself, Prince of the\nOssets, who are next-door neighbours to these Lesghians, when they have\nany door at all, I mean. I won't pretend to know much about him, but\nwhat I have heard is rather shady. He bore a most wonderful reputation\namong his own niggers, if I may call them so, for the Ossets are rather\na dusky lot--never had there been such an Angel seen; too good, too\nbenevolent, too holy. But Apollyon, the Prince of this village of ours,\nhas been too many for our Mountain-Chief; and he has carried on rarely\nat the Hotel Celestial, and other sparkling places. If he had not been a\nPrince, they would have had him up at Bow Street; but he talked about\nRussia, and they thought he was too big. Moreover, our noble Policemen\nsaw that there was nobody likely to interpret him; so they took it out\nin coin, according to the custom of the Country. He paid for a mirror\nand three electro-plated pots; and with mutual esteem they parted. But\nwhat a fiend of a temper he must have! For he never gets drunk to make\nus sponge him with our tears.\"\n\n\"That is most unjust on his part. I have seen him twice, and nearly felt\nhim once. But never mind that. I shall square it up, some day. I beg\npardon for interrupting. But how can S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar ever listen to him?\"\n\n\"When you are as old as I am, Mr. Cranleigh, one thing alone will\nsurprise you. To wit, that you were ever surprised at the folly of the\nwisest of mankind. But I have no time for a homily. You want to know how\nI have learned these things. Have you ever heard of a certain Captain\nStrogue?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I have seen him. And I formed a strong opinion, though all my\nimpressions seem worthless now, that Captain Strogue is a man of honour.\nIn his own way, I mean, and according to his views.\"\n\n\"Not a man who would try to pot you in the dark? I believe that you are\nquite right so far. Strogue is a man of honour, according to his lights.\nBut, alas, an inveterate gambler; and that saps the foundations of\nhonesty. God made honesty, and man makes honour, and shapes it according\nto the fashion of the day. Strogue has been here, he has sat in that\nchair, with his head in his hands, and shivering; for he is also a very\nhard drinker. I am well known all over Europe, as a purchaser of fine\ndiamonds. Strogue had given an I. O. U. the night before for \u00c2\u00a3500, which\nhe could not redeem. He had been fleeced, and he knew it too well, by\npaltry little all-round dealers, hucksters at the very bottom of the\ntrade, who have only one test for gem from paste. If your brother Harold\nwere a bit of a rogue he might have a fine game with them. But Strogue\nhad the wisdom at last to come to me. Poor fellow! He has a very fine\nnature. He absolutely burst into tears, when he saw all the value he had\nthrown away. 'Signor, I am very hard up,' he said--which is just the\nright way to begin with me, though the very worst with any other in the\ntrade; 'this is the last and the best of my jewels. A good judge has\ntold me it is very fine. Unless I can raise \u00c2\u00a3500 to-day, I shall have to\nput a pistol to my head. How much will you give me for this affair?'\n\n\"I examined it well, though a glance was enough. Then I tested him as to\nhis ownership, to keep him on the tenterhooks, as he richly deserved;\nand then I said, 'Captain, I will take it, at a thousand pounds. But\nonly upon one condition.' You should have seen his eyes. It was a\nlamentable sight to discover such joy in the face of a man, who had done\nsuch wonders in his better days. 'My condition,' I proceeded, for he\ncould not speak, 'is that you shall sign a pledge prepared by me.'\n'Anything, anything you like,' he answered; and in two minutes he had\nsigned an undertaking upon his honour to abandon every form of\ngambling. Whether he will keep it is another question; but so far he has\nkept it, and I think he will hold fast. That is what I call doing good.\nAnd the stone was well worth the money.\"\n\nI thought that it would have been still more beneficent, if the stone\nhad not been worth the money. But who could expect that, and of whom?\nSignor Nicolo looked for praise, and I gave it warmly.\n\n\"But you did not pump him, on the strength of it?\" I asked; and meeting\nan indignant glance, I qualified my question. \"What I mean is, you did\nnot exactly endeavour--your duty towards S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, and your desire to\nprotect him from the schemes of that other fellow did not induce you to\ninquire, I suppose, what this pair of rogues could be driving at? I am\nnot sure that I should have let him go without that.\"\n\n\"To a limited extent perhaps I did,\" Signor Nicolo answered with a\ncandid smile; \"not that I put any temptation in his way to make him turn\ntraitor to his master. But simply that casually, as things came about,\nhe cast away in some degree that cowardly veil of caution, which is\nalways so abhorrent to our better feelings. Nine people out of ten would\nhave cross-examined him. But I did nothing of the sort. Only from some\nthings he let slip I gathered a fair general idea of the game those two\nare playing. Or rather that other fellow; for to Strogue it can make no\ndifference, unless the bargain is--no play, no pay. Hafer's game is to\nget possession of the lovely Dariel, as you must have suspected long\nago; not for her beauty--those fellows out there pitch-and-toss for that\nkind of thing--but for the start it will give him, in the universal race\nof robbery. You must not be mild enough, Mr. Cranleigh, to suppose that\nyou have seen any sample of the Caucasus in the noble S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, and his\nsensitive daughter, or even in the model henchman Stepan. If the camp in\nyour valley had been of the general type, you would not have had a sheep\nleft long ago, much less a cock with a crow in his throat. 'Ragamuffins'\nis the proper name for most of them. And although these Lesghians, take\nthem all in all, are about the pick of the basket, you would be in the\nwrong box altogether, if you took them for sweet innocents. They are\nsimply under their chieftain's thumb; and by ancient tribal law, he can\nchop off their heads when he pleases. This keeps them in order; and they\npay for their milk, instead of lifting cattle. Prince Hafer, however, is\nnot under any fealty to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar. So far from that, his great aim is to\nbe Lord of the Ossets, and the Kheusurs too, and Karthlos Tower, which\nis a noble place, and might defy an army for a twelvemonth. Hafer is\ncunning, but has too much temper; and worst of all, he has not steered\nclear of the many traps set by civilisation for a young savage with his\npockets full. He has fallen among a bad lot, a company of young rakes,\ncontemptuous of women, and yet thoroughly in their power.\"\n\n\"What! would he venture near Dariel, after being in such vile company?\nWe have heard that he was almost too good to live. She gave me so grand\nan account of him, that I thought it was all up with my poor chance. But\nwhat a falling off is here! The Prince of all virtues, the paragon of\nmodesty, the hero of all chivalry--and now he won't even sham! Can you\nexplain it, Mr. Nickols?\"\n\n\"No; that's no business of mine. Nature does it. But I shall hear more\nabout it soon, and get a flood of light let in. In London you never know\nanything well, from hearing such a lot about everything. But it is not\nquite the same in the Caucasus. You don't hear much there; but you\nattend to it. And now you will be surprised to be told, that after so\nmany years of hearing next to nothing of that part of the world, and\nnever seeing one of their celestial peaks, except in a dream, I am\nlikely to know more about them than when I lived there. Ah, if I hadn't\ngot a wife, and three daughters,--and I have let out so much, like a\njolly fool, that they won't have French stuff on their birthdays,--I\nshould be ready to be off again; though I could never do the _djedje_\nnow; and the love of sport is not in me, as it is in all true-born\nEnglishmen.\"\n\nHe looked regretful, and perhaps remorseful against his mingled\nparentage; for there was a vein of the Israelite in him, which saddens\nand deepens the outlook, without showing any sport, except a gold disc\nto shoot at.\n\n\"Never mind,\" I answered him, though sorry to have to do it; \"you get\nyour little excitements, in your way. And although they are not like\nours altogether, they pay ever so much better in the end.\"\n\n\"Let us come back,\" he said, thinking in his heart, perhaps, that he\ncould do very well without my sympathy; \"my proceedings only bear upon\nyour case in an odd sort of way, which may come to nothing. You remember\nthat I told you of my Russian friend, whom I met at Odessa, twenty years\nago, or more. Through him I first went into those savage parts, where he\nlost his life; and it was a narrow shave that I survived to tell of it,\nfor which I have to thank S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar. You may have forgotten, but I think\nI must have told you that my Russian had a brother, an officer in the\narmy then closing round the forces of Shamyl. Very well, who should call\nupon me a few days after I told you about that, but the very same\nRussian officer, now second in command of the Caucasus Division, General\nStranglomoff himself. He was in London, about some military business,\nand knowing my intimacy with his poor brother, he did me the honour of\ncalling to hear some particulars of the sad occurrence. I described it\nas well as I could; and then he said, brushing up his English, as I\nbrushed up my Russian, whenever there was a gap between us--'I am not a\njeweller, Signor, and of precious stones I have not any knowledge; but\nplace thine eyes upon this, is it good?\" He wore a white glove of soft\nrat-skin, and upon it was the rich green light of the finest emerald I\nhave seen since I was at Warsaw.\n\n\"'Plenty, plenty, twenty, fifty--ten, a thousand! I pray you to accept\nthis pebble, Signor, for my brother's sake,' he said with a very\ngraceful bow; 'he was taken away through these, and I desire no\nadvantage of them.' And with that he shed a tear, which made me think\nhow much we undervalue that fine race. There is no kinder-hearted man on\nearth, and no more perfect gentleman, than a Russian of the highest\norder.\n\n\"Well, sir, I sent my own nephew out--Jack Nickols, a wonderfully plucky\nfellow; not much eye for a stone; but sure to stick to his orders, and\ntell you the truth. If you can't be satisfied with that, good-bye to\nyour chance of keeping anybody very long; for the sharp ones will soon\nbegin to rogue you. Jack is as good a bit of English Metal as you could\npick up from the lias to the granite. And not too clever. In fact, Mr.\nCranleigh, you remind me of him, at every turn.\"\n\nI bowed very deeply at this lovely compliment, with a glance which I\nmeant to be ironical. But Signor Nicolo was too busy with his thoughts\nto perceive the stern justice he had done me.\n\n\"Emeralds are going up,\" he proceeded, as if I were one of them, \"and I\nshould not be surprised if the true grass-green became the rage for the\nnext few years. There are only three gems that will always hold their\nown, diamonds, rubies, and sapphires. The rest go up and down, according\nto the fashion; and emeralds have been unduly in the shade. But now they\nare worth looking after again; and my nephew is the boy to do it. Hit or\nmiss, he will do his best; and we have made an arrangement with the\nRussian General, under which he is bound to back him up. Jack is not\nvery strong at letter-writing, and the post is not too brisk out there.\nBut he has been on the spot for some time now, and he has made a very\ngood beginning.\"\n\nAll this to me was little more than cold and cloudy comfort. Here was\nthe winter close at hand, the winter of the frosty Caucasus; the friends\nI loved become strangers to me, and lost to my sight among savages; my\nown fair fame in some mysterious manner assailed and blasted; and the\nonly hope of further tidings, or redress, yet visible lay in the chances\nof a roving jeweller's commission! Nickols might take it all quite\ncalmly. His heart was set, and cemented--as one might almost say--upon\nprecious stones, and hard enough, as it seemed to me, to grind them for\ntrade purposes. But in my impatience I wronged him there.\n\n\"You must try to make the best of it, Mr. Cranleigh,\" he went on, as if\nhe understood my thoughts. \"You have been horribly slandered, no doubt;\nand the sweet young lady has swallowed wicked lies, all the more readily\nbecause she is a sweet young lady, and for that reason credulous and\njealous. But there are a lot of things in your favour still, if you\nwill let me set them before you. I have not the least idea what you are\ncharged with, any more than you have. But whatever it may be, the charge\nwill grow fainter, and the faith in it weaker, as time goes on; and the\ninventor of it will become more hateful. Probably Hafer has invented it;\nand even while she listens to it, her heart will turn against him. I\nknow what a good woman is, because I have had to deal with them. A man\nwho runs women down, is either a bad lot himself, or a most unlucky\nfellow. Moreover, she dislikes that cousin of hers, if he is her cousin,\nfor his violence, and roughness, and haughty ways. All that will\nincrease, when he gets home again, and contrasts all their hard and\nuncivilised life with the luxuries and joys of London. She will turn\nagainst him more and more; and her father will never compel her to marry\nagainst her wishes. Moreover, there is likely to be some time yet before\nhis schemes come to a head. My young savage has overthrown his cast, or\nthat of his mother Marva. In his urgency to get them back straightway to\nthe land of the mountain without the flood, he has sent them round by\nSt. Petersburg. He insisted so much on the peril they were in of losing\nall their Lesghian rights, that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar resolved, very wisely as I\nthought, to assert them at headquarters. So Stepan and others were left\nbehind to take the heavy goods straight to Poti perhaps. This was a\nfloorer for Prince Hafer, and he gnashed his teeth, which he dyes\nyellow; for he is the Devil, and no mistake, when he can't have his own\nway. You don't consider me a suspicious man, Mr. Cranleigh, do you?\"\n\n\"A little too much the other way; as is the case with all fine natures,\"\nI replied, according to my thoughts; for he was evidently taking my part\nnow.\n\n\"In that case, listen to my firm belief. I am not at all up to the tone\nand style of what those mountaineers do now. And of course I may be as\nmuch behind the age, as S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar wants to be in front of it. But to my\nmind men are men always, and you can't improve them suddenly. A lot of\nsham comes in with some races; but not with stubborn chaps like these.\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar may print a million copies of the Sermon on the Mount; but it\nwon't go down with them. Or it goes down, and never comes up again. You\nmay as well pour gold into a cesspool. My firm belief is that this\nPrince Hafer intends to get our noble friend out there, marry his\ndaughter, and then shoot him, and combine that heritage with his own.\nAh, yes!\"\n\nNickols had a very quiet and even pleasant manner of imparting the most\natrocious thoughts, that could ever drive another man out of his mind. I\nlooked at him to ask whether he could mean it; and he smiled and\nanswered, \"You may take it for a fact.\"\n\n\"But his own sister, his twin sister, the darling of his\nchildhood--Marva! How could all such wickedness go on without her\nknowledge? It is impossible to imagine that she would allow it.\"\n\n\"She sent her son to England for that very purpose,\" Mr. Nickols\nreplied, in a tone of deep conviction. \"It may not sound sisterly; but\nit is true. There is the blood-feud between them. That they have been in\nthe womb together only makes it deadlier. I know what I am talking of.\"\n\nIf he did--and he spoke as if it were an ordinary matter--I can only be\ncertain that I did not. My brain was quite stunned with such horrible\nideas; and I almost felt as if Dariel herself would be too dear, at the\nprice of any connection with such vile and blood-thirsty savages. Then I\nfelt bitter reproach at blaming a sweet, gentle darling for what she\ncould not help; and after providing for quick communication, I hurried\naway, with my heart in a whirl.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nBLACK FRIDAY\n\n\nIn whatever condition a man may be placed, under the will of Heaven,\nthere is generally something to alleviate it, if he seek perseveringly;\nand always something to aggravate it, without any exertion on his part.\nIn my present trouble I had several consolations; and the best and\nsweetest of them was the kindness of my sister Grace. She had leaped,\nwithout looking for any signal, or even any ground to jump from, to the\nsolid conclusion that her poor brother George had been treated most\ncruelly, shamefully, shockingly, and if there be worse than this, put it\non the pile. And yet she never spoke of it--never at least to me (though\nshe may have filled the world with it to her beloved Jackson)--but let\nme know her sympathies by a silent lift of cover, as a large and capable\nham-boiler does,--when a tin saucepan would have blown its top off. A\nman loathes sympathy if he is of English race; nothing irritates him\nmore than for other fellows to come prying down into what goes on inside\nhim. Even to his dearest friend, he does not stretch out his heart, like\na washerwoman's line; what may be inside it is his own concern; and,\nlike a gentleman, he must not be too curious about that, so long as it\nleads him into nothing mean. All I can say is that I never felt inclined\nto be savage towards the female race, because one of them had\ndisappointed me. And the beauty of it was that I could not hold one\nspark of rancour against her. The great generosity of love was in me;\nand all the fault I had to find went abroad among her sex, but never\ntouched herself. So do jilted poets wail about all other women, but\nacquit the one they love.\n\nBut Grace showed her sympathy more delicately, according to her sex and\neducation. What pleased me most in her behaviour was that she never\nbrought her own little whiffs of love--and lovers are always having\neither whiffs, or tiffs--into her placid pretty interviews with me. She\neven broke out against her own sect, now and then--for the women had\nbegun to make sect of sex even then, as they feign to do now\naltogether--and expressed a contempt of them, which any man would have\nbeen extremely rash to acquiesce in. She meant it for the best, and I\nwas much obliged about it; but not the faintest fibre of my heart was\nput in tune by it.\n\nThen all of a sudden it became the duty of my life to comfort her. One\nevening, getting on for Christmas-tide, I was sitting in my beloved den,\nafter a rather hard day's work, as glum as a Briton can wish to be, but\nsoothed by my pipe, and the smell of saddles, when in came Grace very\nquietly and kindly, but without saying anything at first, as if I were\ntoo busy to notice her. She began to sweep a trifle of tobacco-dust\nwhich had dropped on the table contradictorily--for I am a wonderfully\ntidy fellow--into the pink cup of her palm; and then she went and put\nsomething straight that was straight enough before for any man; and then\nshe pretended not to hear me, when I asked--\"What is the matter, dear?\"\nfor I knew as well as a thousand sighs could have told me, that she was\nin trouble; and being up to every trick of hers, I was sure that her\neyes were full of tears, although she would not let me see them.\n\n\"Butter returned on your hands again?\" I suggested in a feeling tone;\nfor there was an old lady, quite a double patent screw, at the further\nend of the parish, who was never tired of boasting--as old Croaker told\nus more than once--that her butter was made by a baronet's daughter, yet\nsent her such messages as no Duchess would think of sending to her\ndairymaid. \"Returned on my own hands,\" Grace seemed to mutter, and I let\nher take her time, unable as I was to make this out. Then without caring\nproperly where she might be in the narrow little room, she hit upon, by\nforce of a gleam from the fireplace, that very same cracked and spotted\nlooking-glass, in which my friend Tom had admired himself. With\ninfinitely better reason--however feminine and wavering--Grace Cranleigh\nmight have regarded herself, and defied any one (except Dariel) to peep\nover the snowy shoulders. But instead of pride, what came? I know not.\nOnly that I flung my pipe away, and had my darling sister in my arms,\nwhere she cast away all pretence, and would have spoiled any waistcoat\nthat was not worn out.\n\n\"He--he--he,\" she sobbed. And I said--\"What he?\" and she answered \"him,\"\nas if there was only one man in the world, though he might go into fifty\ncases. \"Jackson?\" I asked. But she would not have it even at such a\ncrisis.\n\n\"My Jack,\" she declared, looking up at me, as if every George was\nrubbish; \"my own Jack--will you never understand? And when I was getting\nso fond of him.\"\n\n\"Getting indeed! Why you have thought of nothing else, for at least\nthree months. You have made too much of him; with the usual result, I\ndaresay.\"\n\n\"Oh don't touch me! Don't come near me! No wonder your Dariel ran away.\nYou have not the least sense of noble things. What have I done, to have\nsuch a brother?\"\n\n\"There must be a crack in the family,\" I said, as she cut away into a\nWindsor chair, and fixed all her soul on the fire, as if it were the\nonly warm thing left on earth.\n\n\"Wonderful, wonderful,\" I pursued my own reflections, till she should\ncome round.\n\n\"And you don't even seem to care to ask what it is he has done to me!\"\nGrace began to show her pretty nose over her left shoulder, while I\nsnuffed the candles, and began to fill a pipe. \"Though you know the high\nopinion I always have of your opinion.\"\n\n\"You had better not say a word about it,\" I answered in the kindest\nmanner; \"no doubt it is the usual thing. You told me that all men were\nalike, till you made such an idol of poor Stocks and Stones. Now you see\nthat he is just like the rest of us.\"\n\n\"I have long ceased to hope for any greatness from you; but I did expect\nsome fairness,\" my sister spoke as if I had not allowed her to say a\nword all this time: \"you know that I cannot argue, George; or at least\nyou pretend to think so, which comes to the very same thing with a man.\nThen how thoroughly ashamed of yourself you ought to be, as soon as you\ncan spare me time to tell you the simple truth. Mr. Jackson Stoneman,\nthe gentleman you with such admirable taste and such lofty humour call\n'Stocks and Stones,' is not tired of me, as you kindly imagine. In fact\nhe thinks more of me than ever. If you had only seen his face----\"\n\n\"Don't cry, my dear child. Now don't cry any more. I am very sorry if I\nmisunderstood you. But how could I help it? You do take such a time.\nWhat can be his reason for behaving in this manner?\"\n\n\"Because he is ru--ru--ruined!\" She never was much of a hand at crying;\nbut this terrible word, and her effort at it, served as the cord that\nbrings down the shower-bath. \"Hoo--hoo--hoo!\" she went, and it was no\ngood for me to say anything. \"Oh that Dariel were crying for me like\nthat!\" was the thought that came into my selfish heart. \"I should not\nmind being ru--ru--ruined, if I could only hope for that!\" Then Grace\ngot better, as girls always do, if you let them have their cry out.\n\n\"What makes it so--so distressing, so heart-breaking, is that the whole\nof it has been through me--through me, whom he chose without a single\npenny--me, who had nothing more than poverty to bring him, poverty, and\nfaith, and a very ordinary mind! And then, not content with that, I must\ndo my best to rob him of every farthing of his noble fortune. Perhaps\none of the wealthiest men in the world, until he set eyes upon unlucky\nme. Oh George, it will never be in your power to understand my pure\ncontempt for money! Yet you ought not to rob anybody of it; and I have\nrobbed the noblest man that ever lived of every penny, every penny!\"\n\n\"In the name of the forty thieves, and Morgiana, and the man they cut\ninto four pieces, how can you have done all this?\" I asked, being\ncertain that there never was a girl more reasonable, yet remembering how\nthe wisest of them love a little speculation.\n\n\"To anybody but you, George, it would be too self-evident to require any\nexplanation. Why will you drive me to a thing so painful? Do you mean\nto say that he does not love me?\"\n\n\"Better than his life, I believe; and better even than his money. But\nhow does that bear upon the matter? They don't quote love upon the Stock\nExchange.\"\n\n\"Oh George! And you think you are a business man!\" Grace smiled\ngloriously through her tears, possibly through her triumph over me,\nprobably through the joy of my assurance. \"Can anybody do two things at\nonce? Could my Jack attend to ups and downs, keep his whole mind intent\non Argentinas, contangoes, fundangoes, holdovers, and holdunders, and\neven unspeakable Turks with fifty wives, when the whole of his pure\nheart was down here? Why he only went up about once a-week, if he could\nget me to go out nutting with him.\"\n\n\"Alas, I see. Neglected business. Left understrappers, and dashing young\nclerks, and trusty old codgers with pens behind their ears to stick to\nthe stools, while he made sweet hay. But there must be something more\nthan that.\"\n\n\"You turn everything into vulgarity, George. And you are capable of\nlaughing at the most sacred things. But there was more than that, and a\ngreat deal more than that. You may have heard him speak in his grand\nconfiding manner of a man named Franks, who has been with him many\nyears. He has promoted him from place to place, and trusted him with\nalmost everything; and I do believe that Franks had no intention of\ndoing anything crooked. And he spoke in the most enthusiastic terms of\nme, though of course they never mention such a subject in the office.\nAnd when Black Friday came, as you know it did, through some very stupid\nerror of the Government, Jack only laughed at first, except for the sake\nof some dear friends of his, who were hit rather hard; it appeared so\nridiculous to suppose that a firm like his could be affected. But there\nproved to be something, I cannot quite understand it, although I keep my\nbooks so clearly that I know every farthing owing to me, something, some\ninvolvement, some terrible affair, which will force him to give up the\nHall, and the shooting, and the pedigree Butterfly cows, and even me.\"\n\n\"Don't let him do it. Don't hear of it for a moment. You will never get\nsuch another fellow;\" I exclaimed, as she turned away to wipe her\nglistening cheeks. \"He'll come round as right as a roach in the end. You\ndidn't let him off on that tack, I hope?\"\n\n\"As for letting him off, dear George, is he a trout that I should treat\nhim so? He is not like a slippery fish for a moment, but a deep-hearted,\ntrue-hearted, wonderful man. Why his conversation is as different from\nyours--but I will not depreciate you, unless you go against me. Only I\nshould like to know how I can help myself. When a gentleman says--'I am\ntruly sorry, but I can't have any more to do with you'--oh dear, oh\ndear, what can any lady do?\"\n\n\"Lay hold of his coat, and say, 'None of that nonsense! I am the best\njudge of that question, and I have settled it the other way; unless you\nput up the bans within a month, you must favor me with the address of\nyour Solicitors.'\"\n\n\"Don't laugh at me. I have never laughed at you. I did tell him over and\nover again that the money could never make any difference to me, and\nindeed that I was very glad, except for his sake, because then nobody\ncould ever say--but he talked of the duty of a man, and so forth, and\nthe crime of allowing me to sacrifice myself, and a Cranleigh the wife\nof a bankrupt, and I don't know what else, for I broke down then, and he\nwas obliged----\"\n\n\"Of course he was--any amount of physical sustentation, as the reporters\ncall it. But leave it to me, my dear. Where is he now? Too late for him\nto go back to London, I should think. But I wonder he didn't come to see\nme.\"\n\n\"He did. But you were not to be found. Oh George, I am thinking of every\none of us. What shall we do? The Hall will be thrown upon our hands\nagain, at a time of year when you would as soon live in a hearse. And\nHarold has made another of his great hits, which always cost a hundred\npounds, and never produce a penny. How often I wish that I were like old\nSally, without any pedigree Butterfly blood, and allowed to go and rout\nmy husband up, just as Mrs. Slemmick is!\"\n\n\"She routed him out from the root-house, last week,\" said I, being glad\nof any frivolous turn that might bring the dry colours into the rainbow;\n\"she believed that he was gone for ever, without leaving his wages in\nhis Sunday waistcoat pocket, and Snowdrop Violet Hyacinth just wheezing\ninto the whooping-cough. But no; she underrated the nobility of man. He\nhad tucked up his legs on a big flower-pot with a pipe in his mouth; and\nhis heart was so full that he was going without breakfast. Are women\nalone to be considered faithful?\"\n\n\"You mean that I am worse than Mrs. Slemmick.\" Girls never take the\nmoral of the proverb aright. \"Very well, I daresay I am. But I will\nnever tuck my feet upon a flower-pot, and wait to be coaxed home, when\nthe tea is getting cold. There is something very large in the character\nof Slemmick, and he shows it by his confidence in feminine affection. At\nthe same time, it does appear a little small of you, to quote Mother\nSlemmick against me. She is married, and cannot help herself.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" I cried, leaving her to put the point to it; which she did\nwith a blush, and a very cheerful smile. Then she gave me a kiss, to\nmake up for little words; and I set out to see what I could do for her.\n\nI found the poor Stockbroker looking stock-broken, and sitting on a hard\nchair, with his long legs crossed.\n\n\"Off for the Mediterranean?\" I asked; and he said--\"Bay of Biscay, or\nBay of Fundy. Going to the bottom anyhow.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" I replied, with less elegance than terseness. \"Don't try to make\nme think that you would ever throw the sponge up. I know you a bit\nbetter than that, Jackson Stoneman.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_'Rot!' I replied, with less elegance than terseness._\"]\n\n\"Would you like me to be a thief, George Cranleigh? If I choose to be a\nthief, I can slip out very lightly. But if I prefer to be an honest man,\nthere is very small chance of my doing it.\"\n\nHe told me in a few words what his position was, owing to a panic which\nhad ended in a crash, through the roguery of a few, and the folly of the\nmany; and how his own firm had become involved in thoroughly unsound\ntransactions, mainly through his own inattention and his confidence in\na very clever fellow, who had cut things a little too fine at last, as\nvery clever fellows nearly always do.\n\n\"We must lose a quarter of a million,\" he said, \"even if we pull through\nat all, which is more than doubtful. All depends upon to-morrow. But it\nis not for myself that I care, George. It is for your darling\nsister--the best, and the bravest, and the most unselfish girl--why she\nwanted to stick to me through everything! She behaved as if it could\nmake no difference between us.\"\n\n\"I should hope so indeed. I would disown her if she did otherwise. Did\nyou think that she was going to have you for your money, Jackson?\"\n\n\"I am not quite so bad as that, you may be sure. Still you must excuse a\nmodest fellow for thinking his money the best part of him.\" Here I was\nglad to see one of his old dry smiles. \"But the point of it is this, as\nyou know well enough without my telling--I can have nothing more to say\nto Grace, who was worth all my cash, and my credit, and ambitions, and\neverything except my conscience to me.\"\n\n\"That is all very fine, and very lofty in its way,\" I answered with a\nsuperior smile, which refreshed him, as it was meant to do; \"and among\nCity people it may hold good, or the big world of the Clubland. But no\nsound Englishman takes it so. You don't suppose that my father approved\nof your going in for our Grace, because you then were a wealthy man, I\nshould hope.\" I spoke with strong confidence; but perhaps the strength\nof it was chiefly in my voice.\n\n\"God forbid!\" he replied with horror; while I tried not to doubt that\nGod had forbidden. \"No, I am well aware that Sir Harold disliked it from\nthe first, and Lady Cranleigh even more. It was nothing but the goodness\nof dear Grace. And that makes it such a frightful thing for me. Why,\nthat Angel was ready to stick to me, like--like a brick, if I only would\nallow it. A man who knows the world would never believe it for a\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Then he must know a very bad world, and be a worthy member of it. What\ndo you suppose I would have done to my sister, if she had been mean\nenough to shy off, because of your misfortune?\"\n\n\"How can I tell, George? You are one of the most pig-headed fellows\ngoing. But you could not have been angry with her, for not being quite\nas stubborn as you are.\"\n\n\"Jackson, this is what I would have done. I would have taken the\nmane-scissors that hang above my mantel, and shorn off her great crop of\nhair to her ears. No gold for her there, if her heart were all\npinchbeck.\"\n\nStoneman looked at me with outraged feelings. \"Not even a brother could\ndo that,\" he said, \"brutal as brothers by nature seem to be. But without\nany humbug, George, do you really mean that you wish it to go on?\"\n\n\"If I did not, I should be a wretched snob. It was not for money that\nyou wanted Grace; and you insult her by fancying that she wanted you for\nyours.\"\n\n\"All this is very pleasant doctrine, and an edifying parable for little\nboys and girls;\" the Stockbroker had a peculiar trick of showing his\nkeen eyes as if in a gable, when his mind was puzzled or excited; \"but\nit would not hold water, George, either in a court of honour, or a\ncouncil of wisdom. Grace is entitled, both by birth and beauty, and I am\nsure that I might say by intellect as well, to a position which high\nrank alone, or wealth on her husband's part, can secure. High rank I\ncannot give her. Wealth I could have given. But the prospect of that has\nvanished, and with it vanishes all my hope of her. Oh that she had only\nthrown me over! I could have got over it then. But not now.\"\n\n\"Now look here,\" I said, as a Briton always calls attention to the\nknock-down blow he is delivering; \"all that would be worth listening to,\nif it had anything to do with the matter. But, as it happens, my sister\nGrace doesn't care a flip about position, any more than I do, or you, or\nanybody else with a ha'porth of common-sense. We value the opinion of\ngood people; and we like money for the comfort of others, as well as\nourselves. But as for that mysterious affair you call 'position'--the\nmore you poke your head up, the harder cracks you get on it. Grace will\nbe contented with whatever pleases you. That holds you together, and you\nnever slip away. People who have only got a lawn enjoy it a thousand\ntimes as much as a lord enjoys his park. And a man who loves his wife\ndoes not want to lose her among a thousand men and women he has never\nheard of, all pushing about to please themselves, and sneering at them\nboth, by way of gratitude.\"\n\n\"You will make a fine domestic character, George, if you only act up to\nyour theories. I shall never forget your true friendship and noble\nbehaviour in this matter. I shall take my own course, however, as I\nalways do. I know what is right: and you may talk for ever. There is\nonly one voice that could move me, and that one shall have no chance of\ndoing it (even if desired) for her own sweet sake. But everything will\ndepend upon to-morrow; if things are as bad then as they have been\nto-day, there will be no escape for me. Grace shall never be a\nbankrupt's wife. If her sense of honour urges it, mine forbids. And it\nis not only honour, but common-sense, my friend. Your family has fallen\nin the world too much already. It shall not be dragged lower by any\nconnection with a defaulting Stockbroker.\"\n\nHis face showed no sign of emotion now; and I owned to myself that from\nhis point of view no other course was possible for a man of honour.\nWhether his point of view was right or wrong, is quite a different\nquestion; but in spite of all my reasoning, I have very little doubt\nthat I should have done as he did.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nFRANGI, NON FLECTI\n\n\n\"Jack is getting on like a house on fire,\" Signor Nicolo wrote in an\nenvelope enclosing a rather grimy letter, which I received on the\nfollowing morning; \"he has not had a classical education, and so you can\nalways make out what he means. Specimens to hand confirm his opinion.\nPerhaps I shall go out in the spring. Could not stand the cold there\nnow. Come and see me whenever you think fit.\"\n\nWhen this was put into my hand, I was ready to start for London, having\npromised to meet Stoneman outside the Exchange, at one o'clock. This had\nbeen my own proposal, for one can never be certain how a man may take\ngreat ups and downs of fortune; and although I had not much apprehension\nas to Stoneman's fortitude, it seemed to me that a good friend should be\nat hand and do his best for him. So I read the letter of young Jack\nNickols, on my way to London-Bridge, and found it very straightforward\nand simple; and who cares for spelling after that? The rising generation\ngets on very well without it, and a thousand school-boards do their\nutmost to destroy its memory.\n\n\n     \"Never did see a place so mountanious,\"--this young fellow said,\n     where I first began to read, for the Signor had kept the first page\n     in his pocket, or leather bag, or steel safe, so far as I could\n     tell--\"you never get up to the jag of one knife-grinder, before you\n     have got to fetch your wind, and grind your bones for another. The\n     Alps is nothing to it; they goes up gradual, and is ever so much\n     smaller to my mind. And you don't get big chaps here to shove you\n     up and keep you straight. These fellows cackle at you with a horrid\n     voice, and they squat in a ring and stare at you, if you want to go\n     up any clumsy sort of peak, and they tell one another that all\n     Englishmen are mad. But they are as sharp about the rhino as\n     Petticoat Lane crossed with a New Cut costermonger; and you can't\n     bring them to book, as you can a thief at home. You have to do it\n     all through a chap who knows their lingo; and you can't make out\n     what he is saying to them, and you can't be sure, without your\n     revolver ready that they won't stick their skewers, which they call\n     jingles, into your spine, without letting you look round. I had a\n     poor time of it at first; but they seem to be getting now to make\n     me out.\n\n     \"When you come to know them, you might find worse fellows; for I\n     cannot call them treacherous exackly. They would skin you to your\n     spare-rib, if you let them have the chance; but they won't stick a\n     knife into you, until you aggravate them. I am getting rather thick\n     with some of them, by making out a little of their crack-jaw words,\n     though there seems to be no end of them. But talk about jaws, I\n     need not tell you, as you have seen too much of them. There was a\n     man in Yorkshire, about fifty years ago, who could get through a\n     lamb, and then three quarters of her mother. But one of these\n     fellows would eat the whole sheep first, and then take her little\n     ones for desert. But you must remember that their sheep weigh less\n     than ours, and I like to see a man make a hearty dinner. But it is\n     hard lines to pay him for the sheep; and then let him come to dine\n     with you, as he must do, so that you never get a taste of it.\n\n     \"However I am not complaining. The country must be beautiful, when\n     the snow lets a fellow look at it, and you think the more about it,\n     because it is out of sight. Tell Rosa that the girls are not a\n     patch upon her, and she would laugh to see how they put their hair\n     up. The men are not refined enough to think much of the women; but\n     make them wear swabs upon their faces, and the insects are\n     tremenjious in the summer-time. We have got more than we can do now\n     to keep any road clear to get at the pocket where the stones are,\n     just a soft place between two tremenjious rocks; down comes the\n     snow again, and you could scarcely find it out, unless you leave a\n     black tar-pole sticking up, and then you must fix it wonderfully\n     firm, or you won't find it in the morning, for the wind does blow,\n     I can tell you. We shall have to knock off for three months, I am\n     afraid, and where am I to go to all the time? The Russians are not\n     half bad fellows, only some of them too pious when you come to know\n     them. Only you may be glad of that sometimes, because when they go\n     to say their prayers, you get the best place by the fire. I don't\n     care for quite so much tea myself, and I have not tasted a good bit\n     of tobacco for a month. But everybody says that when some great\n     man, who has been living for several years in England, and I do\n     believe I have heard you speak of him, when he comes back they say\n     he will change everything, all the thieves of the mountains will\n     begin to say their prayers, and nobody will stick his best friend\n     for nothing. If this can be managed, it will be a true excelsior.\n\n     \"But you remember what the people said, the year we went to\n     Yarmouth; and it is out of the question for me to say what I would\n     give to be there now. They said, and you could not deny it when you\n     wanted a bloater before they came in--'Sir, we lay ourselves out to\n     oblige all the gents that come from London, but we cannot make a\n     red herring swim.' I could not see exactly how they meant it, but\n     it is just the same thing in the Caucasus.\n\n     \"For a long time I could not see my way to be sure of not being\n     struck at any moment. But I got over that idea, as we must, if we\n     mean to get on anywhere. I will not say that my life is sacred now,\n     as people express it in London; but ever since the popular opinion\n     began to identify me with the Devil, through their ignorance of\n     English manners, I have had a much better time of it. Tell Rosa,\n     that in spite of uncommonly rough victuals, I weigh seven pounds\n     more than I could pull, when she came to see me off at Wood-Green\n     station. Nobody ever weighs anybody here, for after all they are\n     not cannibals; though I told her so, to make her kiss me. But the\n     steelyard I brought goes to half an ounce, and has saved me a lot\n     of money. And tell her, if you think that it won't be too\n     encroaching, under the peculiar circumstances, that I am not quite\n     turned into the Devil yet, though she might say so if she could see\n     me; and even if the climate had done it, an Angel like her need not\n     be afraid of him. Hoping to come home with a sackful of emeralds,\n     believe me, dear Uncle James, your most affectionate nephew,\n\n     JOHN NICKOLS.\"\n\n\nAt the bottom of this very vague and disjointed, but as it proved\nafterwards too true description, Signor Nicolo had written in pencil:\n\"Rosa is my eldest daughter; but I shall have to put a stop to it.\"\n\n\"My noble countrymen!\" as S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar used to call them,--it would take a\nlong time to fetch them up to that mark, according to this English boy's\naccount, and the enthusiastic chief could not begin too soon. It\nappeared to me that as many generations as he could trace from Karthlos\nwould scarcely be enough to restore them to the level of antediluvian\n\"culture.\" No wonder that he was in a hurry to begin; and if I am doomed\nto wait for the completion of his task, _erit altera qu\u00c3\u00a6 vehat Argo_,\nthere will be another ark on the top of Ararat. And sure enough, here is\nanother Babel to begin with!\n\nFor in the absorption of the thoughts above recounted, I found myself\ncaught in the whirl and crush and uproar of a crowd as wild as any\nsavage land could show. A crowd not of paupers but well-dressed people\nroaring and raging and besieging the portals of the Stock Exchange.\nBattered hats, and coats in tatters, fists thrown up, but unable through\ncrunched elbow to come down again, faces black with choking wrath,\nwherever the brown mud peeled from them, grinding teeth and cursing\nlips, and chests that groaned with the digs they took without any chance\nof returning them--I thought of Lord Melladew's father and the bullock\ncompressed into his clover-hay. Only let me keep outside the pack of the\ncentral squeeze if possible; for once in there, no strength of man could\nget me out or let me out. So I put up my knee, which was a dangerous\nthing to do, for if I lost my feet good-bye to me; when a gentleman,\nwith whom it would have been a joy to dine--so comely, and well-liking,\nand well-to-do was he--being unable to get at me with his fists, let out\nat me with language I had never heard the like of. I attempted no\nretort, for he had already got the worst of it, and without any\nknowledge how it came to pass, except that there must be more luck than\nwit in shoving, here I was with my clothes still pretty sound, outside\nthe drum of squashed figs and squealing pigs.\n\nBut another poor fellow was not so lucky. \"Let him go, slide him on,\nhe'll be dead in half a minute. Serve him right. No, no. How'd you like\nit? Don't tread on him, more than you can help.\" It was a solid man upon\nthe ground, but likely to be hollow, before ever he could be an upright\nman. I had got a short knob-stick in my hand (which I always carried,\nsince my faith in human nature had waned through that dastardly bullet)\nand in the most blundering and selfish manner I set the knob against my\nbreast and the stub-end foremost, and charged into the lump of figures\nacross me. Considerable yielding, and heads running into heads, and\nyellow waistcoats sloping like sheaves of wheat in shock, and big boots\ntoeing up at me, and a hail of blows in flank--it is impossible to say\nhow I got on. But there must have been a hollow place somewhere in the\nmass, for they fought into a lane, and allowed me to lay hold of a pair\nof yellow shoes, or at least they had been yellow, and tow out the\nprostrate body on its back, and feel it for the signs of life or death.\n\"Ain't dead yet,\" said a hoarse and husky voice; \"never fainted in my\nlife, and don't mean to do it now.\"\n\nI admired the pluck of this poor fellow; for indeed he was in a\nfrightful mess, and another half-minute must have silenced him forever.\nWith the help of a bystander, who only cost a shilling, I was able to\nget my trodden friend across the street, and into a double doorway,\nwhere a score of people came and stared at him. \"Well, if he ain't a\ntough 'un. Cut the poor bloke's collar. Stand him on his pins, and blow\nto him. Give him a drop of brandy.\" Advice poured in on every side, more\nfreely than assistance.\n\n\"Don't you know who I am, you fools?\" The injured man sat up with the\naid of one hand on the stones, and gazed defiantly. \"All over the world\nI've been, but never saw such cursed idiots. Captain Strogue, sir, of\nthe British Pioneers.\"\n\nHe glanced at me with hazy eyes, which told of many strong waters, and\nwould tell of many more, if Heaven permitted; and then he tried to bow,\nbut a pang in his chest took the grace from that salutation. \"All right!\nDown the alley, three doors to the left.\"\n\nHe shoved away all who pressed forward to lift him, but allowed me to\nhelp him with his knees still hanging, to the place he had indicated.\nAnd sure enough everybody knew him there.\n\n\"The Captain, the Captain, the bold British Captain! He have been in the\nwars, and no mistake!\" Out came the landlady and the barmaid, with tears\nin their eyes--for he had promised to marry both--and an ancient potboy\nwith all his wits about him brought a rummer and a teaspoon, and stirred\nup something hot. \"That's the physic, ma'am,\" he said; and the lady\nsmiled and offered it, and met with no refusal.\n\nIn a word, Captain Strogue was in the right place now, and after helping\nto bestow him snugly upon a horse-hair sofa in a small back room, I was\nat the point of leaving, when he put up one hand and stopped me.\n\n\"Owe you my life,\" he said; \"not worth much now, but has done a deal of\nservice to civilization. Near St. Paul's, ain't we? That's where they'll\nput me. Know your face very well, but can't remember.\"\n\nHe seemed to be dropping off into a doze, having finished his strong\npotation; but I told him my name and where I had met him, for I was\neager to be off to keep my time with Stoneman.\n\n\"Don't be in a hurry, sir; you have helped me, and I can help you.\nStrogue pays his debts. Somebody else will find that out.\" His eyes\nshone fiercely, and he pressed his knuckles to his side. \"Widow Lazenby\nknows what I am--don't you, ducky?\"\n\n\"Oh, Captain! And at such a crisis!\" the landlady murmured, after\nlooking round to be certain where the barmaid was. \"But, sir, he have\ndescribed himself. Wonders he have done, without wondering at himself.\"\n\nIt is a righteous thing that men of such achievements should have their\nreward, where it is sweetest. Fame they may never get, for that is all a\nfluke; gold they scarcely ever gain, because they are no grubbers; love\nthey cannot stop to grasp, and see but savage frames of it; rank they\nlaugh at, having found it the chief delight of black boys; but to get\nhis grog for glory, and his victuals for victory, is the utmost any\nEnglish pioneer can hope of England.\n\n\"Cranleigh, you can go,\" said Strogue, for his manners were not perfect;\n\"you are involved in this little shindy, and you want to know all about\nit. These thieves shut shop at one o'clock on a Saturday, some one told\nme. But if you will come back by two, I shall have set this rib by then,\nand have rump-steak and oysters. Join me, without any ceremony. I owe\nyou a debt, and you shall have it.\"\n\nI had seen too many strange things now to be surprised at anything, as I\nmight have been six months ago; and it was plain that this companion of\nthe hateful Hafer meant to do me some good turn at a private\nopportunity. So I promised to return by two o'clock, and hurried to\nStoneman's business place, avoiding the crowd that still was yelling at\nevery approach to the House of Mammon. \"Bless you, sir; it is nothing at\nall compared to what it was yesterday. Ah, that was something like a\nrow!\" a big policeman told me; \"there was fifty taken to hospital, and\nthe barriers snapped like hurdles. Why, there ain't been half-a-dozen\nribs to-day. You can't call that no panic.\"\n\nNeither did I find any panic at Jackson Stoneman's offices. A stolid old\nclerk was putting things away, and evidently anxious to get home to\nearly dinner. He told me that his principal had been disappointed at not\nmeeting me, and concluded (as the train had been in long enough) that\nsomething had occurred to stop me, and so had departed on his own\naccount. When I asked how things had gone that morning, old Peppersall\neyed me with some indignation, as if it were impossible for anything to\ngo wrong with a firm so stable and majestic. \"Well, how did the senior\npartner look?\" I asked; and Peppersall replied: \"He was a bit put out\nabout a sixpence that rolled off a desk in room No. 8, till it turned up\nunder the wainscoting.\"\n\n\"You'll do,\" I said rather rudely, for this rebuff was not too\ncourteous, and he stared at me as if there could be any doubt about his\ndoing. \"That is the sort of fellow for a business-man, instead of any\nnew young manager\"--was my reflection, as I strode with good heart\ntowards the rump-steak and oysters.\n\nCaptain Strogue had been sponged and darned and brushed and polished\nup--so far as he was capable of polish--by skilful and tender hands, and\nwas sitting in a brown arm-chair, as bolt upright as if his ribs had\nthickened, as a barn-floor does, by the flail of many heels upon them.\n\"Keep 'em like that,\" he said, \"for about two hours, and fill up well\ninside, and it stands to reason that they must come right--can't help\nthemselves. Doctors? None of them for Bat Strogue. The only doctor I\never knew was any good is down your way now, a queer German cove. Say\ngrace for me, and carve for me, and fall to, my son. Take me for your\nguest; and you might have a more squeamish one.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nTWAIN MORE THAN TWIN\n\n\nIn spite of all anxiety, it was impossible to be anxious for the moment,\nin the company of this extraordinary fellow. Doubt is the most hostile\nand hateful element to all human pleasure; and doubt was at once kicked\nout from the society of Captain Strogue. Certainty stood in its place,\nas firm as--well, I might say as firm as Strogue's own nose, for I can\nthink of nothing firmer. Short and thick and straight it was, like a\nbuttress to support his bulky forehead, and keep his bright and defiant\neyes from glaring into one another; for they had a little cast towards\nit. Certainty also in the strongest point of all--that whoever you might\nbe, or wherever you had been, never till now had you come into\ncontact--or collision, if you liked that sort of thing--with a member of\nyour race so far above all little weakness, and yet so ready to\nparticipate in it, if you would pay the bill for him, as your new but\ntrue friend, Bartholomew Strogue.\n\n\"Imar is an exceedingly fine chap,\" he said, as he lit a long clay pipe,\nafter a dinner which impressed me with the truth that the more a man\nsees the more he feeds; \"you are too young, friend Cranleigh, to have\nany powers of reflection. But you may take it from me, that there are\nonly two ways now of being fit to consider yourself a fine chap. Of\ncourse I don't talk of nincompoops, who think themselves wonderful\nalways. What I mean is in common-sense; and there you can only be above\nthe ruck, by despising the human race, as I do; or loving it, as Imar\ndoes. I have found nothing in them to admire, though I have seen the\ninner side of many celebrated men; and as for loving them--well, I\nsuppose the Lord puts that into you, and bungs up your eyes. The man who\ncan do it is the happiest of his race, and a great deal too good to be\nleft among them. No fool can do it; for a fool always goes by facts.\"\n\n\"S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar is the largest-minded man I ever knew,\" I broke in upon\nStrogue with some indignation. \"He looks at the best side, as all good\npeople do. He likes human nature, because he judges by himself.\"\n\n\"Contempt is at the bottom of it. Amiable contempt, if you like to call\nit so. The contempt of an equitable mind, that knows the faults of its\nowner, and loving them, makes allowance for the like in others. Bless\nyour heart, Cranleigh, I like people well enough; but I despise them,\nbecause I despise myself. Come now, that is fair play. I am not\nargumentative; no man of action ever is. But that view of the case is a\npuzzle to you.\"\n\n\"Not a bit,\" I answered, with a smile of modest triumph; \"you despise\nmankind, because you think they are like you. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar loves them,\nbecause he thinks they are like him!\"\n\n\"Bravo! I like a man who tries an honest rap at me. Bat Strogue never\ntakes offence at truth, because he very seldom gets the chance. But I\ndid not fetch you here to argue with you. I believe that I can be of\nservice to you, very good service, such as you have rendered me; though\nperhaps you would not have pulled me out, if you had known who it was\nyou got hold of?\"\n\n\"Yes, I would; and with all the greater pleasure. I thought that you\nwere a decent Englishman; though I saw you in very bad company, that\nday!\"\n\n\"A decent Englishman! One of the most celebrated travellers of the age!\nSuch is fame. Wait until my book comes out. I might have been the lion\nof the season, if I liked. What are S. and G. and L.? What have they\ndone in comparison with me? However, let them have it for the moment.\nBad company, Cranleigh? You are quite right there. Many scurvy tricks\nhave I been played; but none to come near what that blackguard has\ndone. The fool, the besotted fool he must be. I was told you were far\naway in Yorkshire, and engaged to be married to a lady there. Nothing of\nthe sort? If I had known that, I would have come down to see you. He\nthinks he has got everything his own way; and he has thrown me over on\nthe strength of it. Much more than that--much worse than that. Oh, what\na pretty mistake he has made! Nobody ever fooled Bat Strogue yet,\nwithout paying out for it. Things are gone far, very far, my friend; but\nwe may be even with them yet. I see things now that I never dreamed of.\nBut tell me first of your own share in them.\"\n\nI told him briefly what had happened to myself. How after winning a\npledge for life from Dariel, and the approval of her father, I had been\nsuddenly called away to the wedding of my oldest friend, and had been\nkept there for several days by the sudden distress of the family. Then\nas soon as I could get away without inhumanity I had hastened home, and\nbeen utterly astonished to find the valley empty, and no message left\nfor me, except that cold letter from the man who had been so kind. And\nthen I told him also what I knew from Signor Nicolo, and his black\nsuspicions as to Hafer's object.\n\n\"It is impossible for them to be too black,\" Strogue replied with an\nominous smile. \"S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's life is not worth the lump of sugar melting\nunder this glass pestle. Hafer's heart is vile enough, but a viler\nheart, and a brain ten times as resolute and as deep as his, are set\nupon poor S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's death. I see it all now with the help of what you\ntell me. I took it in quite another light before. There is one thing\nstill that I cannot understand. I fell out with that miscreant first,\nbecause I found that he wanted me to lend a hand to get you put out of\nthe way, as if I were one of his tribesmen. What puzzles me beyond\neverything is that he never tried it.\"\n\n\"He did try it, and a very narrow shave I had. It was the very night\nafter I saw you with him.\" Then I told Strogue the particulars of that\ncowardly and cold-blooded attempt, and Stepan's conclusion about it.\n\n\"It is impossible to doubt it. The murderous sneak! One thing I can tell\nyou, young man; that marriage of your friend has saved your family the\nexpenses of your funeral. Two days more in that part of the world would\nhave sent you to your last account. He would never have shot at you\nagain; such is their superstition, that he believes you invulnerable by\nbullet; but he would have put a long dagger into you, springing from a\ncorner in the dark. At that game you would have no chance with him, even\nif you were on the outlook. You are stronger than he is, I daresay; but\nhe is the most lissome fellow I have ever met, and I have handled a good\nmany twisters and skippers in the way of savages. And to think that I\nshould be almost trodden into dust, like the emmets in a hymn I used to\nlearn, by a trumpery lot of common cockneys. It was contempt of the\nenemy that did it, a thing that generally ensures defeat. None of that\nnow, that won't do now. Cranleigh, we shall have to do all we know; and\nthe chances are that it will never be enough. It is not for Hafer, so\nmuch as that fiend of a woman, who stands behind him. One of the worst\nthat ever walked this earth, and that is no small order, I can tell you.\nA bad woman is blacker than a man, as many shades as gas-tar is than\nStockholm pitch.\"\n\n\"But who is it? Who is it? You have hinted that before. What woman in\nthe world would hurt S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, who looks upon them all as angels, in the\nreaction from his great mistake?\"\n\n\"I will tell you who it is, by-and-by; and you will be surprised a\nlittle. But first a few questions; and very important. The luck has been\nterribly adverse. Most of all in this, that I should not have known,\nuntil it was too late to stop him, the scoundrelly schemes of this\nHafer, and his abrupt cut-and-run. But if I have made a mistake, so has\nhe. Bat Strogue is hard to beat, young man; though he thinks so little\nof himself. But now, first of all, is there any chance of catching\nStepan? He is a thick, of course; as all faithful servants are. You\ncould not make head or tail of him; but I know their scabby lingo. Do\nyou know what ship he goes by?\"\n\n\"Not I. The fact is that I was quite upset, and felt that being so\nthrown over I had no right to pry into their arrangements. All the heavy\ngoods were going by some cargo-steamer. Blackwall was on the\ncanvas-wrappings. That is all I know about it.\"\n\n\"Then we are too late for that. Those heavy boats sail on a Thursday.\nBut the one point in our favour is that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar goes first to\nPetersburg. He has good friends there; but in spite of that, if I know\nanything of Russian ways, it will take at least three months for him to\nget a stroke of business done. And he will not want to take his daughter\nto her new surroundings, when the furious winter rages there. His\nenemies thought to settle him, this side of Christmas, and have three\nmonths to gorge him and hide the spoil, while all the passes are blocked\nwith snow. But they have overplayed their game, and they never dreamed\nof that stroke of his, which may give us time to save him. He has no\nidea of their plot, of course, but has acted with his usual simplicity.\nOne more question--can we obtain any idea of what goes on there, through\nNickols, or any of his jolly miners? I am sorry for them. What a dance\nthey will have on Kazbek, with frost-bitten toes! But they can't get\naway now, that's one comfort.\"\n\n\"How can I tell? I know nothing about communication with those deserts.\nThat is more in your line, and you know the country.\"\n\n\"There are not many countries beyond my knowledge,\" the British Pioneer\nreplied, with a gaze as if the whole world lay before it; \"but even I\ncannot always quote all the breaks and jerks of wire and post. However,\nI can easily find out. They were laying a line to Kutais, I know; but I\ndon't know whether it is working, and if it is it won't help us much,\nwhen all the tracks are impassable. One more question; young man, excuse\nit, but are you still nuts upon that lovely girl, who is too good for\nany but an Englishman? I don't hold with matrimony, mind. So you need\nnot mind saying if you have slipped off.\"\n\n\"I wish she were equally nuts upon me,\" I replied with a glance of\ncontempt, which should have pricked him. \"But she has vanished without\neven a good word. I shall never hear anything more of her.\"\n\n\"Stuff! Remember--'faint heart,' etc. She has been humbugged with lies\nabout you. And I know the pride of all that race. You shall have her\nyet, if you show pluck; and you won't be like yourself, if you fail\nthere. But you want to know who the dark enemy is, the one who is\nresolved to have S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's life, as well as everything else that\nbelongs to him. Very well, it is his own twin sister, Marva.\"\n\n\"What! Marva, the widow of Rakhan, that rascally Prince of the Ossets,\nwhom Imar very justly slew! So justly, that even he felt no compunction.\nMarva, who knew of her husband's falseness!\"\n\n\"That's the woman, and a nice specimen she is. I know one or two fine\nthings about her, from what Hafer, her own son, let out. Ah, she is a\ndeep one. It is a lucky thing for Imar that she sent Hafer, instead of\ncoming to manage the whole affair herself.\"\n\n\"You forget one thing, Captain Strogue,\" I interrupted, for this view of\nthe Princess did not tally well with S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's own account. \"She pitied\nhim, there can be no doubt about that, after his terrible calamity,\nthough as yet she did not know the worst. She pitied him, and proved it\nby her distress at the death of his little boy Origen. And when a woman\nonce lets pity in, there is no room for malice in her breast. I read\nthat the other day, in a very great writer.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that. I only know that she hates him. All\nthe wreck of her life she ascribes to him, because he would not pay her\nportion. She has been brought up very differently from him, you must\nremember. And when she was so kind about that poor little devil, she had\nnot the least idea that her husband that very day had fallen by the hand\nof Imar. Very likely she loved her husband all the more, without knowing\nit herself, for his behaviour to her. Some women do, there is no\nquestion about that; and there is queer morality in the Caucasus. She\nhates Imar, with all the power of her heart, which is anything but a\nweak one; and even if she loved him, she would be bound to kill him; for\nthe blood-feud is between them.\"\n\n\"You talk of it as if you were counting coppers; whereas it makes my\nblood run cold, cold and then hot, as if it boiled with a shudder.\"\n\n\"Ah, but I have seen the world,\" said Strogue.\n\n\"Very well, then tell me this. In the name of common-sense--if such a\nfaculty is known among such brutes--why did not Hafer put a bullet or a\ndagger into Imar, as he has had fifty chances and more of doing, instead\nof taking a steady but unlucky pop at me? Explain that, Captain, if you\ncan.\"\n\n\"Nothing is easier, friend Cranleigh. In the first place, he is not the\none to do it, without ruin to their scheme; for though he might marry\nDariel, after that there would always be something between them. And\nwhat would make it useless for him to do it, is that the blood must be\nshed, as you might say, for the sprinkling of the doorstep. To kill him\nin England would not count, because nobody would be sure of it. Hafer\nmight have made a hit, but he could not have scored it, and the revenues\nwould not have fallen in for years.\"\n\n\"It makes me sick to hear you talk.\" I had no intention of being rude;\nbut to see this man making balance of lives, as a grocer puts chocolates\ninto the scale, was beyond my gifts at present. \"Strogue, you make me\nhate you.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, you should not do that. I admire fine British indignation;\nand I had a lot of it at your age. I am not free from it now, by any\nmeans. But it must be governed and guided, when we deal with inferior\nraces. A Frenchman never discovers this, and therefore he cannot\ncolonise. He lets out his natural ardour at brutality, while we\naccommodate ours, and fetch it into better purpose. You must not suppose\nthat I sympathise with a savage, because I do not shoot him.\"\n\nI begged his pardon; for I knew nothing of such things. And he made\nallowance for my outburst; while I thought that I would rather play the\nFrench than the English part, in such a case--which was far from my\nusual sentiment.\n\n\"You need not make a fuss,\" he said, \"all these things are an allegory.\nThe wisest of men has been young and green at some time. Bat Strogue is\nnot the boy to sing for starch in bibs and tuckers. Cranleigh, you may\nlook at me, and some day you will tell your grandson--'Ah, you should\nhave seen Bat Strogue! An Englishman of the old sort he was. Forty-six\ninches round the chest, and not a lie to be found in him.' Give me your\nhand, young man, I like you.\"\n\nIt occurred to me--so mean our nature is--that the brandy-and-water,\nwhich he quaffed like milk, was beginning to perturb a spirit even so\nubiquitous. But his gaze was clear and bright as it had not been in the\nmorning, and his voice impressive.\n\n\"You have only to go home, and wait. I have a friend who is on his way\nat this moment to St. Petersburg. I shall telegraph to him to-morrow, to\nkeep his eye on S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar. He will have no trouble about that, the man\nbeing so conspicuous. I shall know when Imar thinks of leaving, and then\nwe must look sharp indeed. You want to save him; so do I. And more than\nthat, to blow to pieces the plans of this vile Hafer. He has treated me\ninfamously; I will not bother you with that now. He little knows what\nBat Strogue is. I might have starved, but for Jemmy Nickols. Just for\nthe present I am in cash; but money never sticks to me. If the sinews of\nwar fail, I shall not scruple to ask your help, though I know that you\nare not a millionaire, George Cranleigh. But I am a man of honour, sir.\nThough not a swell, I am no sponge. And I have some chance of a good\nwindfall which is keeping me in London now. 'Never say die,' is my\nmotto, sir; and if I get what I ought, I will lend you a hundred pounds\nas soon as look at you. Strogue is of Yorkshire family, sir, and a\nYorkshireman always does what he says. But that Hafer is a cur, as mean\na cur, and as fierce a cur, as was ever begotten by Cerberus. He made a\nscoundrel rob me of five hundred pounds, by false cards; as I found out\njust too late, and they split the swag between them. A burglar is a\ntrump in comparison with them; and he has taken out young Petheril\ninstead of me. Cranleigh, do you ask me why? Then I'll tell you in two\nwords; because he can get him cheaper, sir, and because he has got no\nprinciple. Strogue must travel like a gentleman, as he is by birth and\nbehaviour, and all that; Strogue maintains his rank, sir. You try to\nshove him into any skunky corner to save a few copeks in passage-money,\nand he lets you know--ay, you soon find that out, and you won't forget\nit in a hurry. But this fellow Petheril, that's his name, he would make\nany skunk's hole skunkier; and you wouldn't care to touch him with a\npair of tongs. And another reason I can tell you too, Petheril doesn't\nknow the little things about that beauty of a Marva, which have come to\nmy ears, though I never saw her. Shows what my reputation\nis--'Bartholomew Strogue, The World,' would find me from any post-office\nin it. Though when you send me a hundred-pound note, it would be as well\nto be more precise. But I am not proud of that; it is a nuisance to me.\nI open a hundred letters, when I find myself in the humour, and there is\nnot a penny in one of them; but they all want me to do something.\"\n\nFearing that he was becoming inclined to go off on the rove, as great\ntravellers must, and being in a hurry about Stoneman and Grace, I asked\nhim to say in a few words how Prince Hafer came under his charge in\nLondon.\n\n\"Simply because of my taking a little turn into the Caucasus,\" Captain\nStrogue replied, as if he had gone off into a side-walk in some\nHampstead villa garden. \"I was tired of the monotony on the northern\nside of the Caspian, where the people are too much alike, with plenty of\nbarbarous customs; but when you have seen one, you know them all. There\nis not the variety which can be found in the mountain regions only. In a\nvery rugged land, the human race cannot get so confoundedly chummy as to\ntake the variety out of them, like peas in a pod perhaps a thousand\nmiles long. The Caucasus is quite a small affair, compared to the Andes,\nor Himalaya, or half-a-dozen other mountain-chains. But it beats them\nall in this, that it was peopled earlier, or at any rate more thickly.\nAnd there the fellows are; no two lots at all alike; and if it was the\ncradle of the human race, as the ethnologists used to tell us, it was\nlucky that we tumbled out of it. Mind, I don't run them down; there are\nsome of the noblest samples, so far as the body is concerned, that you\ncould find on the face of the earth. And many of noble intelligence\ntoo, but with little chance of increasing it. As a rule, they hate work,\nboth of body and of mind; and without proper work, we all relapse into\nmonkeys, or advance into devils. You say, 'Strogue, then which are you?'\nYou were longing to ask it, but too polite. Very well, Cranleigh, I am\nneither. I have done as much hard work as any man living. And I hope to\ndo more, if my life holds out, although my joints are getting rickety.\nBut my rule is--either work, or play. And I never mix the two together.\"\n\n\"But,\" I inquired, to bring him back to the point, for he seemed to be\nrather fond of talking about himself, \"what was the reason that Hafer,\nif he was sent to fetch his uncle back, was not despatched to the camp\nat once, the old place in the valley, I mean, where his countrymen had\ntaken up their abode. That would have saved all the London expenses, and\nthe need for a guide and interpreter, and a lot of other trouble, as\nwell as kept him out of mischief.\"\n\n\"True, my son; but it would have ruined the whole scheme. Hafer's nature\nwould soon have shown itself, for his temper is simply horrible; kinjals\nwould have flashed in the Surrey sun, and no Dariel would there have\nbeen for him. Even as it was, he contrived sometimes to make himself\nunpleasant to her. You remember our catching your little friend Allai,\nand putting some strain upon his loyalty? That was to learn a few useful\nfacts from him, especially one about the lady and her father, and some\npoints as to your proceedings. If you had not interfered, we should very\nsoon have succeeded, for there is no great power of endurance in them.\nNo, no. His mother knows too well what Hafer is, to quarter him on a\nquiet gentleman. And he never would have stood it. He came here to have\nhis fling, quite as much as to carry out her plot--and a jolly wild time\nhe has had of it. There is no steady love in a man like that, any more\nthan there was in his father Rakhan.\"\n\n\"Foul scum of the earth, low blackguard! How dare he come near Dariel?\"\nFor the moment I lost my self-command. \"How can I wait, Strogue? Am I to\nsit and count the time, while Imar and his daughter are going to their\ndoom? Why not set off for Petersburg and try to keep them there? Or at\nany rate warn them, and go back with them, if they must go, and face\nthat wicked woman and her despicable son. That seems to me to be the\nbetter plan by far. It would cost a lot of money; but I would beg,\nborrow, steal--\"\n\n\"Won't do. You must follow my directions. In the first place, you forget\nwhat a cloud you are under. Probably S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar and his daughter would\nrefuse to see you if you followed them. Or if you got over that\ndifficulty, would they listen to your story? You know nothing about\nMarva's scheme, except through me, and I have no proofs. It is all\nsuspicion, or inference from little slips of Hafer's and so on, and what\nI have heard since he departed. Mind you, I know it, as well as if I saw\nit; but there is nothing I could lay before Imar, to convince him that\nhis sister intends to have him murdered, and to make her son the Master\nof Karthlos, and Chief of that branch of the Lesghians. Be in no hurry,\nmy good young friend. I shall prick you up quite soon enough. It is the\njerking that spoils everything. We were a nobler race five hundred years\nago than we are now; because we took our time to think, and mind kept\ntime with body. These fellows also take their time. They learn it from\nthe way the snow falls; and they know that the snow tells a deeper tale\nthan fifty thousand thunderstorms. In the Caucasus a tragedy--and they\nhave no such thing as comedy--goes into ten acts at least, and lasts for\ngenerations.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nA CROOKED BILLET\n\n\nOnce I saw the solid keeper of a well-known elephant (a grand mass of\nsagacious substance, gentle, good, and amiable) try his hand among the\nmonkeys, creatures in their way as worthy, but of different fibre. These\ntoo knew what kindness is, and had their sense of gratitude, but could\nnot stop to dwell upon it, and let it ripen in their hearts. The keeper,\naccustomed to slow ways, and leisurely though deep emotion, exerted all\nhis charm of eye and benevolence of whistle, and offered baits to\ncupboard-love, and even deigned to winsome ticklings of places not too\nhairy to be touched by human tenderness. He gazed with zoologic pride at\nthe manager of the monkeys, who was putting a new lash on his whip; then\nhis glory flew into a shriek, for his thumb was bitten in twain, and a\njabber of general joy endorsed it.\n\nSo it is too sure to be with any man, who drawing reason from her higher\nsources, applies the product of his skill, even in homoeopathic doses,\nto that irrational creature--love. Strogue had no idea of the meaning of\nthat word. A traveller gets too-far abroad, too loose, and large, and\nvague, and shifty, shallow with glancing instead of gazing, skimming the\nworld instead of letting it cream. Therefore to me there was scarcely a\ncrumb of comfort in all his assurances; and the only thing to stroke the\nlong anxiety the right way of the grain, and smooth its tissue, was to\nkeep on steadily with the labours of the day. And when these can be\ncarried on out of doors, under the sky, and (if so I may say) with the\neyes of the Lord smiling down on them, it is not to the credit of any\nyoung man, if he kicks about under his blanket and groans, when the\nnight makes all things equal. Unless he has bodily pain, I mean--which\nis another pair of shoes, that can never be unlaced by any effort of our\nown.\n\nMoreover, to see one's dearest friends escaping from some black\ndistress, and coming back to their usual cheer, and jokes, and pleasure\nin the world around, takes or ought to take a lot of lead out of our own\nhandicap. Although my sister had never been by any means painfully\nsympathetic with my misfortunes in the way of love, I was candid enough\nto feel that this might be because I had never asked her. Such an\naffection as mine was far beyond her understanding, a thing too holy to\nbe discussed by any girl with yellow hair in love with a member of the\nStock Exchange. But I quite forgave her all short-comings, the moment\nshe fell into real trouble, and I wiped her eyes almost as softly as if\nthey had been Dariel's. And this renewed our deep attachment, which had\nlost perhaps some little of its warmth, when she took to finding virtues\nin that marvellous Jackson Stoneman, which she had pronounced a hundred\ntimes to be sadly deficient in her brother. However they revived and\nflourished now; and I was not so mean as to ask how they came back, but\nwas proud of their possession. Let us take all the credit we can get,\nfrom people who are fond of us; there will scarcely be enough to plug\nthe holes our other brethren pick in us.\n\nStoneman, too, having turned the corner by the narrowest of shaves, with\nthe paint shorn from his shaft and felly, but his box and axle as sound\nas ever, was much improved for the present by the increase of humility.\nOr perhaps it would be more correct to say, by the birth of that quality\nwithin him; for if it had existed heretofore, it had been so true to\nitself as to recoil from all recognition. Except of course in his first\nlove-time; for if a man cannot be humble then, Lucifer is no match for\nhim. It is needless to say that the losses of the firm were spread from\nmouth to mouth at any figure that occurred to the imagination, long\nbefore the senior partner himself could lay a loose measure along them.\nBut he managed to stick to the Hall and the Park; though he gave up his\nyacht, and the hounds, and other enjoyments now too costly, and at\nGrace's urgent order clave to money-making all the week, and left the\nlove for Sundays.\n\nThere was even some little talk about my throwing up the plough, and\nharrow, pitchfork, flail, and stable-bucket, and quitting in despair the\nland that had now become too honest to maintain mankind. To wit, I was\nto join our Jackson, not as a partner (for the solid reason that I had\nno capital), but as an agent, an assessor, or I forget what they called\nit. My father wished it, and so did my mother, and every one except\nmyself; and I was doubting whether the sense of duty to my relatives\nought not to outweigh my own tastes and wishes, when all my thoughts\nwere upset again, and all my mind unsettled, by a letter just as\nfollows:--\n\n\n     \"DEAR SIR,--I must seek pardon for neglect or carelessness about\n     something. But it did not enter my thoughts at first, that the\n     letter enclosed belongs to you, or perhaps to the lady to whom it\n     was written. And we have been on the railway, or at sea so much,\n     and in strange hotels, that I could not procure it from my boxes. I\n     hope that it is of no importance; but I now perceive that I have\n     been guilty of a sad want of attention, which may have caused blame\n     to fall on others. If so I beg to be pardoned by them, for I had no\n     intention of retaining what could never belong to me.--Your\n     obedient servant,\n\n     \"DARIEL, daughter of IMAR.\"\n\n\nThe letter enclosed, or rather the note, was one of several little\nbillets, in which I had answered questions from Tom Erricker's sister,\nArgyrophylla, during that most melancholy time, when there was no one\nelse to support her. She behaved, all through that terrible period, in a\nfaultless manner; such as even Dariel herself would have found it hard\nto equal. Argyrophylla was just as mournful, just as trustful in the\nLord and the depth of heartfelt sympathy, just as determined to overcome\nher own feelings for the sake of others, as the nicest girl that was\never born, and therefore has to deal with death, could be. Any man who\ncould be cold to her (with her father just dead, and her mother scarcely\nmore than alive enough to moan) deserved to be screwed down, I say, and\nfind no one at his funeral. But I never care to defend myself. It is\nclear enough what any one must think of this, being told that it was all\nabout some crayfish soup, which was more for the lawyer's delectation\nthan for mine:--\n\n\n     \"MY MOST KIND AND THOUGHTFUL PILLA,--What matter for such trifles\n     now? Remember that all I care about is to be of service to you. It\n     would have been a weary day but for that consideration. Do exactly\n     as you feel inclined, but how happy I should be if you would come\n     down to dinner. [This I only wrote that I might try to make her eat\n     a bit, because she would not even take her gruel.] For the sake of\n     the many who love you, think a little of yourself, if a heart so\n     unselfish has the power. You must never speak as if I wished to be\n     elsewhere, unless your desire is to grieve me. You shall hear what\n     the lawyer has done for us by-and-by; but his chief wish is to\n     please us. You know quite well what mine is.--Ever yours, GEORGE\n     CRANLEIGH.\n\n     \"P. S.--The canon most readily promised to officiate.\"\n\n\nNow that such a simple letter, written when the cloth was laying, and\nthe room grown shadowy, yet full of thoughts of dinner-time--for Pilla\nthrough her tears took care to keep the kitchen-jack alive--that a few\nkind words like these of mine should start up as wilful enemies, is a\nproof of that which men like Strogue might take into some dry coil of\nbrain, having filled it more with the study of mankind than with\nconverse of their Maker. To wit, that whenever any human being yields to\nthe goodwill towards his fellows which has been implanted in him, he is\nmaking a fool of himself, without doing a bit of good to his brethren.\nLet Strogue think so, if he likes, and prove it by a thousand instances;\nhe will not get me to believe it, or at any rate to act as if I did.\n\nAnd here you will find, if you go on, that it was not so even in my own\ncase. At first it looked very bad indeed, and I made a grievance of it,\nas any but a perfect man must do; and him I have still to meet with. How\non earth could that hasty note, written only for comfort in profound\ndistress, and with the warmth one feels for affliction, have fallen into\nthe hands of some vile enemy, who had used it to destroy my Dariel's\nfaith in me? Over and over again I read the words I had scrawled in a\nhurry; and the more I pored over them the more distinctly I saw what\nthey might mean to Dariel. One most unlucky reference too would quench\nany doubt she might try to cherish. In my brief account of that sad\naffair at Sheffield, I mentioned, or should have done so, that Mr.\nErricker's old and trusted solicitor was gone from home at the time of\nthe sudden calamity, and his place had been supplied by a junior\npartner, a peaceful young man, who would never take the lead. His only\nanxiety was to keep within the possibility of mistake; and this (as the\nwidow was so ill, and entreated me to act for her) compelled me to be\ncontent with legal sanction rather than counsel. But Dariel knowing\nnought of that, or of the affliction in the house, would naturally\nconclude that the lawyer was come to arrange for my marriage with poor\nPilla. \"Well, this is a kettle of fish, and a kettle of devil-fish,\" I\nthought; \"but one great joy there is--my darling has not thrown me over\nthrough a toss-up.\"\n\nAll my love (which had never been away, longer than I could live without\nmy heart) came back with a rush of double power, and a wild condition\nprevailed with me. That cold letter of dismissal bore no date of time or\nplace, and afforded not a trace of the writer's whereabouts or\nintentions, except that it bore the post-mark of Dresden, and a date now\nfour days old. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had told me more than once of his love for art,\nand deep regret that his stormy life had allowed him no acquaintance\nwith it. Also he had shown me a very ancient--daub I should have called\nit, but for the subject--supposed to be a portrait of our Lord on panel,\nwhich according to legend had been brought by St. Peter when he came to\npreach in the Caucasus. Although he was not sure of that tradition, the\nLesghian chief attached no small importance to this heirloom, and was\nanxious to compare the face, or as much of it as could be descried, with\nsome of the first presentments, or conceptions, to be found in Europe.\nHe was gifted very richly, as all great men are, with the power of\nmoving slowly, not only abstaining from all attempt to rob Time of his\nforelock, but also offering that old robber plenty of leisure to tug his\nown. Thus the father of Dariel might stray through many a gallery,\nmuseum, and cathedral, before he reached the Russian capital; and\nwherever he was, there beyond a doubt would be his beloved daughter.\n\nWith this belief, I lost no time in going to see Strogue again, at least\nto hear what he had to say, though I expected little comfort. The place\nto which he now belonged, though it seemed more truly to belong to him,\nwas that ancient tavern \"The London Rock,\" so called perhaps in\ntranscendence of the London Stone, which was not far off. An\nold-fashioned, overhanging house, with windows like the stern-galleries\nof a veteran three-decker, and a double door with big brass fittings,\nand glass panels glancing; the whole withdrawn as with an inner meaning,\nand prim sense of private rights, even from the organ-grinder, who\ndictates to the alley, and the babies who tripudiate, with tongues that\ncan keep time, whenever dirty feet are weary. Strogue had seen all the\nworld almost, and was come back to the beginning of it, smiling at the\nglee of childhood through the majesty of a placid smoke.\n\nYou never could take that man aback; perhaps because that sort of thing\nhad been done to him once too often. He sat in a hooded chair of state,\nwith a long pipe casting garlands of the true Nicotine forget-me-not,\nlike a floral crown for his emerit head; but his legs were in front of\nhim as they ought to be, and the day being still in its youth, no car of\nBacchus had begun to jingle through the calm realms of baccy. Or at\nleast, there was only one cool tankard, and the crown of froth was gone\nfrom that.\n\n\"How is the rib?\" I asked in my usual stupid way, for all enquiry was\nout of place in a paradise so tranquil. And then I proceeded still more\nineptly by begging him not to be disturbed.\n\n\"What rib?\" enquired Strogue, with as much surprise as he could\nreconcile with his dignity.\n\n\"Why, the rib that was broken the other day,\" I answered, with some\nsense of trespass on his constitution.\n\n\"I remember now; and I call it very kind of you to think of it. But I\nunderstand my own inside, and can very soon put it right again. How are\nyou getting on with your love-affair, my boy?\"\n\nI did not see my way (as people always put it now, when they don't want\nto do what you want of them)--I did not see the fitness of discussing\nDariel in this draught of echo, and with the bar in the background\nclinking pots and mumbling chaff.\n\n\"Hold my pipe, while I get up,\" the Captain said magnanimously, for his\nfeet were on a leg-rest, and it was very good of him to move; \"I never\ntake anything so early in the day; but I don't judge the juniors. Come\nalong, and bring my pewter.\"\n\nWhen he had led me to an inner room, which appeared to be his sanctum, I\ntold him what had happened, but could not by any means bring myself to\nshow him Dariel's letter. And he did not ask for it; with all his\nbluffness, at heart he was a gentleman.\n\n\"Cut up rough, of course,\" he said; \"would not have been worth her salt,\nif she hadn't. Only two things are added to our knowledge. One that they\nhave been at Dresden, and the other that Hafer has been at work with\nthat musk-rat of a Petheril. He sent him to Sheffield after you; that is\nplainer than a pikestaff. He could not have gone on his own hook; for he\nknows nothing of English ways, and very little of the language. He found\nthat I would not do his dirty work, and so he took up with that\nblackguard. And cleaned me out, sir, cleaned me out! That is where I\nshall never forgive myself, until I cry evens with him. Would you look\nfor any green lines in Bat Strogue, a tyke who has been round the\nworld?\"\n\nHe stared at me so fiercely that I could scarce help laughing. Then he\nlaughed at himself, and said, \"All right, by-and-by. You go and see if\nJemmy Nickols has heard anything. I can tell you one piece of good news.\nI told you what I was in London about. It has turned out ever so much\nbetter than I thought. Those confounded lawyers would not let me have a\ncopper. But I put the enemy's lawyer at them; and by Jove, sir, I expect\nto get five thousand pounds. Not in a lump, mind; that would be too good\nfor an unlucky son of a gun like me; but a thousand by the end of\nJanuary, and the rest when some business in Yorkshire is wound up. So I\nneed not come down upon you for a penny; and more than that, my boy, I\nwill pay the piper, and you can pay your share, when your ship comes in.\nWe will have a grand time among the niggers. Don't thank me, or I'll\nnever forgive you. You have done me a good turn, and I'll repay it. Bat\nStrogue is a Christian, because he backs his friends up. But he doesn't\nhold with forgiving his enemies. He will have Hafer by the hip, and you\nshall see it. Stop a moment; you know some great swells, don't you?\"\n\n\"One or two people of title I know. But none of them are in London yet.\nI could write to them, of course, if that would do as well.\"\n\n\"That never does as well. But they will soon come back. Parliament meets\nrather early this year. And we must not expect to stir a stump till\nMarch. My friend at Petersburg is not a great gun; of about my own mark,\nbut not of my distinction. Bless you, I can go to Court anywhere, and\nplenty of bowing and scraping; but a tankard of malt is worth all of it.\nIf you could get a line under cover from a friend to our Ambassador at\nPetersburg, he would pass it on to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar when he gets there, and you\nmight make it right with your lady-love. I suppose that never occurred\nto you. Strogue knows the way to go to work. What do you think of that,\nmy friend?\"\n\n\"I think it is a very good suggestion, and very kind of you to think of\nit. If I had not been in such a hurry, I daresay it would have occurred\nto me.\"\n\n\"Not likely; but Nickols might have thought of it. And I daresay he\nknows great guns too. All those diamond-mongers do. You will manage it\neasily one way or another, and the sooner you do it the better. It will\nput a spoke in Hafer's wheel, but not the one I mean to put. Ask Nickols\nwhat sort of a winter they are having out that way. It might make a\ngreat difference to us. They very seldom have it as ours is, generally\nthe very opposite. We are having it mild, so the chances are that they\nhave got a stinger. All Azof was frozen up, and a good bit of the Black\nSea, the last time I came that way, and in London and Paris there had\nnot been one day's skating. However, you keep ready.\"\n\nThis was the very thing I meant to do, as soon as ever I could get the\nchance, and pick a little money up, for it was not likely that I would\nlet the Captain bear the charges. With many thanks to him, I took an\nomnibus, and had a short conversation with Nickols. As soon as he had\nheard my story, he approved of Strogue's suggestion, and quite agreed\nwith him that we should both be ready to start as soon as we could do\nany good. At the same time he said that there was not much chance of any\nmischief for the present, and he doubted whether Hafer had even returned\nto his native country yet. It was much more likely that after his taste\nof the sins of high civilization, which must have gone far to destroy\nthe zest for dull Caucasian villainies, he would hanker for another\nsparkling draught, before going home to be frozen up. And now he had\nPetheril with him, to guide and interpret all sweet baseness.\n\n\"Petheril! where have I heard that name? Not only from Strogue, but\nsomewhere else,\" I exclaimed, but could not remember.\n\nFor the rest, Signor Nicolo knew little, except that his nephew Jack was\ngetting the rough side of British enterprise. His last note was short\nwithout any sweetness, unless it were a waft for Rosa, to whom he was\nall the more faithful, while frozen.\n\n\"All been snowed up ever so long,\" he was tersely graphic with his\nmiddle finger blue; \"nothing to do, and less to eat. How I wish I had\nonly stopped away! Saved our lives with a goat that was frozen to death,\nbut had to eat him stiff, for the fire was frozen too. Tried to think\nof mutton at Simpson's in the Strand; but imagination not warm enough.\nSnow is white, and emeralds green. Shall never see anything green again,\nunless it is gangrene in my toes. But you know that I never do\ncomplain.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" said the Signor, as he warmed the letter that he might\nnot take a chill from it, \"my nephew never does complain. But sometimes\nhe exaggerates, and that made my daughter like him. I shall not let her\nknow a word of this, or she might put some of the blame on me. I know\nthat it is sure to be cold out there, when you go too far up the\nhillside. However, let us poke the fire up. You look rather chilly, Mr.\nCranleigh. Rosa knitted him two pairs of mittens; but perhaps he put\nthem by for keepsakes. Boys are so confoundedly romantic. But the wind\nhas changed since yesterday. Strogue is the only man I know who\nunderstands the weather. He would warm poor Jack in no time.\"\n\n\"You had better send him out with another pair of mittens,\" I said, with\nsome natural indignation. But the Signor had a pleasant gift of deafness\nto anything that twined against his twist.\n\n\"I shall see Strogue from time to time,\" he continued very comfortably;\n\"there is a great deal of good in that man, when you get over his little\noddities. And I am heartily glad to hear of his coming into property.\nProbably he will not drink now so freely; because it would be his place\nto pay for it. I know a fine fellow who was saved like that, when you\nwould not have given twopence for his life. However, your course is\nclear, Mr. Cranleigh. Patience--what is it about the mulberry leaf? You\nshould certainly write to St. Petersburg at once. Your brother-in-law,\nthe Earl of Fitzragon, is sure to know some one who will do the needful\nfor you. Or if not, I think I could manage it. You have been very lucky\nin falling in with Strogue, a man of great natural powers in his way,\nand very wide observation. Allow me; your coat is a little on the twist.\nYou shall hear from me, if anything turns up. Ah, we want a little frost\nto kill the slugs, though we don't want to live upon frozen goat.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nFAREWELL, SMILER\n\n\nIn proof of the critical, exacting, and thankless nature of the noble\nBriton, my father used to tell a little story savouring perhaps of the\nfable. Three excellent gardeners and botanists, representative of our\n\"three islands\"--as a learned Frenchman calls them--were searching some\ntorrid mountain slope, as travellers for a great London nursery. When\nready to drop with heat and thirst, for they had missed their supply of\nwater, they chanced upon a vine in a sheltered spot, bearing three fine\nbunches of ripe grapes. Like good men and just, they tossed for choice;\nPaddy coming last, as his destiny decrees. His bunch was gone in no\ntime, skin, stones, and stalk, while John Bull proceeded with a calm and\nsteady munch. Sandy, however, stood contemplating his,--the finest\ncluster of the three,--holding it against the burning sky, with its dewy\npurple glistening like amethysts of ice. \"Arrah, then, why don't ye ate\nit?\" cried Pat; \"if ye can't, it's meself that knows the bhoy as can.\"\n\"Hoot, toots, mon, a' was joost conseederin',\" the Scotchman replied, as\nhe held it out of reach, \"what a bonny boonch she wud a' been, gin I had\nonly had the loock to come along aboot twal' weeks bock wi' my theening\nscissors.\"\n\nPerhaps I was not quite so hard to please as that. But instead of being\ngrateful for the many strokes of luck vouchsafed in my present strait, I\ndid nothing but grumble at all that went amiss and growl at the heavy\nroll and everlasting lurch of time. However, let every man act according\nto his nature, or his own perversion of it; but I was not going to be\nbeaten thus. It would never do to leave the chance of obtaining some\nnews from St. Petersburg to a casual traveller, like Strogue's friend. I\nmust try to learn a little more about that. Therefore, as I would not go\nto Lord Fitzragon, it came into my mind that really I owed some amends\nto Lord Melladew; not for the peppering of his spats (for I had not even\nused a gun that day), but for my tolerance of such a stupid business,\nand the absence of wrath in my sorrow for it. The Earl had employed his\nlame time in writing a fine poem upon Russia, which had received a\nlittle private circulation; and a cultivated Russian, who had seen the\npoem, pronounced it the finest thing in the English language. Without\ngoing to that extent, I knew that his lordship was now a \"Persona grata\"\n(which means properly a welcome mask) at the Court of the Northern\nUniverse.\n\nWhen I met him at his club by appointment, for he was still in some\nterror of his mother, he showed himself as cordial as any young man who\noperates mainly with his intellect can be. \"We never have mutton-chops\nhere,\" he said, glancing along me, as if I were a hedgerow, with the\nside-look that comes from living always in a street; \"but the view from\nthe window is pleasing, George; and I can show you spots quite\nhistorical.\"\n\n\"Much obliged. But history is no good without age; and our own affairs\nare no good, when they get it.\"\n\nHe saw that I was going to be a plague, and he sank into a gimcrack\nvelvet chair, which was handicapped too heavily, even with such weight\nas his, and he waved his hand for me to do the like; but I found a thing\nlike a music-stool having more satisfactory understanding.\n\n\"How I have longed to be down your way!\" Conversation with him reminded\nme always of holding a skein of tissue silk for a lady to wind while you\nbob your thumbs. \"Any sign of spring, George? Willow catkins?\nElder-leaves?\"\n\n\"No, nor yet younger leaves,\" I answered gently. \"Lots of frost to come\nyet, I daresay. Lovely time for fruit-growers--cut their noses off in\nMay.\"\n\n\"I hope not. That bugbear must have been exploded. If I come down to see\nthe budding year, dear George, could you--I mean, could you tell me\nwhere to go? I want to write a paper for the R.H.S. I began one on the\nKentish pear and apple bloom last year, with a County Council lecturer\nwho came down that he might be certain which was which. But the wind\nchopped round suddenly, and we got snowed up, and naturally all the\nfruit failed that season. But the year before that, there would have\nbeen a splendid crop, except for that gale on the 1st of September; I\ndaresay you remember it. When I went to make an estimate of the saving\nto the country by growing its own fruit, with my usual luck I could find\nno proper specimens. The walks were so strewn with green fruit that my\nfeet were too tender to get along among the heaps, without two men with\nbrooms in front of me; and even so I could scarcely get upstairs that\nnight. But how is our good friend Bandilow?\"\n\n\"Becoming rather nervous, I am afraid. His family did their best to keep\nit from him about that other poor grower towards Godalming, who made\nthat frightful application of his gooseberry-knife. But poor Bandilow\nhad a sharpish tiff with his mother-in-law, as he could not see his way\nto keep her; and the cruel woman sent him full account of the inquest,\nwith the lunatic doctor's evidence, and the balance-sheet of several\nyears' jam-boiling, underlined in crimson ink. He told all the parish at\nthe Bell-tap on Friday, that the only plantation he should ever make now\nmust be in a box, and grow up into a stone.\"\n\n\"I hope not, I trust not most heartily,\" said the Earl, brushing his\neyes, for he was very tender-hearted. \"But let us turn to more cheerful\nsubjects. I feel sadly upset about it. Let us have a glass of port.\"\n\nAfter that he appeared a little stronger, and gladly undertook to\nforward any letter of mine to a friend of his who was attached to our\nembassy in Russia, and he felt no doubt that as soon as S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar\nappeared in that capital, it would be placed in his hands. Without\nlosing an hour I wrote my letter, and left it in his charge, for there\ncould be no harm in being too early, whereas it would be fatal to all my\nhopes, if I were even an hour too late.\n\nMy letter was short, and not too cordial; for really, when one came to\nreflect upon all the circumstances, my Lesghian friends had scarcely\nallowed me fair play, or so much as a chance to right myself. No man can\nbe sure what he would have done, in a case which has not hit him in the\nbreast, although we are very fond of talking so. Nevertheless, when I\nput a bit of spirit into my own consideration of myself, I could not\nhelp thinking that I would have given any one who fell into a sudden\ncloud of dust with me, more opportunity to clear the dirt away, and a\nfairer chance of asking from whose chimney it had come.\n\nFor weeks and weeks, I kept on waiting, looking out for anything that\nmight throw light on the whereabouts of my wandering friends, but\nobtaining disappointment only. The mildness of the winter continued\nhere; but a bitter frost prevailed in Eastern Europe, and the Danube was\nfrozen over at the Iron Gates. Strogue heard from his friend at St.\nPetersburg that the ice on the Neva was six feet thick, and they could\nscarcely keep the railways open. And Signor Nicolo was compelled to hope\nall he could about his nephew Jack, and comfort his daughter Rosa with\ntales of a cat who lived three months in a snow-drift, and the horse who\ngot into a hay-rick near Durham, and ate his way out again when the\nthatch began to drip. But he told me in confidence that he never was\nmore pleased to have a bad leg than when Jack's mother came to see him.\nFor sweethearts, being young, may shortly take up with another; but a\nwidow with one child has locked up all her reason in him.\n\nHowever, there was this advantage in the long suspense and waiting, that\nit gave me time to make all preparations leisurely, and get the money\nready for a costly expedition. The cash I could have had from several\nquarters; Nickols, Strogue, Tom Erricker, and Stoneman, now beginning to\nrecover from his troubles, all in the kindest manner offered to advance\nme a good round sum. But wonders, when they once set in, are like boys\nplaying leap-frog. Over each other's back they vault, and then down they\ndrop with hand on knee for a taller one to top them. And surely now came\nthe tallest one that ever rolled in at a tithe-barn door, or struck the\nlintel of a giraffe-house.\n\nHitherto I have felt throughout that every word must be believed exactly\nas I tell it, not on the faith of my character only, but from internal\nevidence. This has made me careless perhaps; but now I mean to be very\nstrict, confining every vocable to its first intention, and every\nnumeral to its precise notation. For if any other person had related as\nfollows, my interjections probably would have made him knock me down!\n\nThe days were beginning to pull out a little, and the wind was gone\nround to the east--as it always does, when too late to be of service for\nskates, or wild ducks, or golden plovers, but in good time to kill all\nbloom and foliage--and having had my bit of bacon in my Privy Council\nOffice (as Grace now called the harness-room), I was dwelling on my bad\nluck; than which there is no messuage more insanitary for any man to\ninhabit. When in came my brother Harold, with his hands in his pockets,\nand his usual slouch, and soft melodious whistle. I had wanted him many\ntimes, when I could not find him, especially to show him to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar;\nbut now I could see little chance of turning him into any value.\n\n\"Not fool enough to want a fiver, I suppose,\" he said without offering\nto shake hands, for if ever there was a careless fellow about forms,\nhere you had him.\n\n\"To have one to spare is what you mean to say. If a man is a fool who\nwants a fiver, I know a very clever fellow, who is a great fool always.\nBut he can't get it out of me. _Nulla bona._\"\n\n\"George,\" said my brother in that slurring tone, which means that any\ncare of pronunciation would be wasted on the muff before you; \"you can\nhave some, if you like. But don't let me force it upon you, George.\nThere are several other fellows after me.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" I answered, simply for his benefit not my own--for I did\nnot expect to see anything worth counting; \"that old tobacco-jar is\nempty; out with it, and let me put the top on. Is it from the sneezers,\nand the Local Board?\"\n\n\"Who ever got a penny from a Local Board? If I could invent a machine\nto do that, I should beat the great man in America. My sneezers, as you\ncall them, will be household words, when reason has a voice in\nsanitation. But this new discovery is of a million times the value,\nbecause it is for the destruction of mankind. It will kill a thousand\nmen, before they can call upon the Lord; and there will be no pieces\nleft for the Devil. I had scruples at first, because of the wholesale\ncarnage, and some of the victims might deserve to live; but the\nkindest-hearted man alive, and the chairman of five or six humane\nsocieties, ridicules that objection, and has taken shares. At the first\nblush it may seem too strong a measure; but when you know that it puts\nan end to war, you are reconciled to a few harsh moments.\"\n\nThere is a certain sound, enjoyed more often by bankers and brewers than\nby delvers of the earth, a silken harmony of thoughtful notes, silvery\nand sensitive, suggestive also of golden tones yet mellower. Seldom,\nalas! do we find it thrilling through the music of our spheres. Once\nheard, it is never forgotten; and now I heard it murmuring in my\ntobacco-jar, as it flowed from the lyre of my brother's fingers.\n\n\"Hold hard!\" I shouted. \"What the deuce are you about? You villain, you\nhave been forging! I was sure you'd come to that. But I doubt whether\neven Free-Trade makes it honest.\"\n\n\"Nice gratitude,\" he answered, \"when it is all for you. One would think\nthat you alone had the gift of making money. But it would take you a\nlong time to make that, my boy. Now help yourself. Don't be shy.\"\n\n\"Harold, you have worked hard for this.\" As I spoke, I regarded my elder\nbrother with respectful sympathy, such as he never had inspired until\nnow; \"and I cannot perceive that I have any right to make a hole in your\nhard earnings. Do you think that I would do anything so mean? But how\nmuch do you suppose you have dropped into that jar? If you heartily\ndesire to make me a little present--\"\n\n\"Perhaps there may be about two-fifty there. They got up a company, you\nsee, to work my patent Slaughter-ball. That makes everything\nstraightforward. The investors throw in, to get other people's money,\nand it is their own look-out about keeping their own. But peg away,\nGeorge; peg away.\"\n\n\"You are indeed a noble fellow.\" I spoke heartily and generously; when\nthe facts come to this, between two brothers, how can there be either\ngrudge or greed? \"But you would only run through every penny, my dear\nbrother. The wisest thing probably would be for me to secure for you\nsome five-and-twenty.\"\n\n\"You had better take larger views. But I leave you altogether to your\nown devices.\" He jerked a chair over, and put his heels upon the hob,\nand whistled to the modest fire, with his back toward me.\n\n\"Fifteen, twenty, twenty-five,\" I said, \"thank you heartily, my dear\nfellow, I call it very kind of you.\" He gave me a nod, without stopping\nhis whistle, and that made me look into the jar again.\n\n\"Well, there does seem to be a jolly lot. I have a great mind to go a\nlittle further down. In all probability, you would only waste it,\nHarold.\" He gave me two nods this time, as if to say--\"I will not deny\nit, if you take that view.\"\n\n\"Fifty would be quite as well, while one is about it. Forty, forty-five,\nfifty. Ah! you may not see me again for months, my dear fellow; even if\nI ever come back alive. I am going to the most dangerous part of the\nworld, where they stick a thing into you they call a kinjal. Harold, we\nhave always been fond of one another, although we are so different.\nWell, fifty then; but only as a loan, mind.\"\n\n\"I tell you what,\" he said, turning round and looking at me with\nresolute authority, \"I am your elder brother, George, and know more of\nthe world than you do. In fact, you are nothing but a farmer; and even\nthe Government, stupid as it is, can make game of a farmer. Now if you\ndon't take a hundred pounds, as a gentleman and a brother should, you\nmay go to the Devil, and how shall I ever see you again, while you are\nthere? So take your choice, and have done with it.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_'I tell you what,' he said, turning round and looking\nat me with authority._\"]\n\nHow could I part with him on such terms? And it struck me suddenly,\nthat if he were going to knock over all the human race, or at least the\nnon-British branches of it, nothing could stand him in better stead than\nto be able to say that the first-fruits of his discovery had been used\nto set a true Briton upon his legs. With a grateful heart I left him at\nleast a hundred and fifty pounds of his money, reminding him at the same\ntime of that duty towards our parents, which he alone now would have the\nprivilege of fulfilling. He promised to leave at least fifty pounds for\nthat; and then he went into particulars about his \"astrapebolia,\" as he\ncalled his discovery for visiting mankind with a human touch from\nheaven. This I could not understand, and therefore make no pretence to\nremember it; for my brain is not mathematical. Only I know that he\npleased me by a promise that he would always keep behind the guns, when\nhe sent them into action.\n\nHe went away suddenly as he came, being always of the comet order, but\nas lovable as the evening-star, whenever you could get hold of him. And\nwhen I had clapped a patent padlock on the first product of his genius,\na dark terror seized me that my only brother, so endeared to small\npeople like me, by his largeness, might be tempting Providence too far,\nand meddle too freely with fulminates, just as they began to pay. I\nlonged to write to him upon the subject; but no post ever knew where to\nfind him.\n\nThen I was suddenly called away from vague apprehensions to perils at\narm's-length, and even closer than that--blows eye to eye, and cheek by\njowl, and tooth to tooth, such as a peaceful Englishman would never\nface, if he could help it; but must take as the will of the Lord, when\nthey come. Sith it will no better be; he is sorry for himself, and does\nhis best to make his enemies share his dejection.\n\nIn token I need only say that when I was going on peacefully, sore at\nheart with outraged love, but too proud to allow it to be mentioned, and\ngirding myself for the work of the spring and that duty to the earth\nwhich a farmer must discharge even in despair of recompense--a dirty\nyellow envelope was put into my hand, as I came home with two faithful\nhorses as tired with dragging as I was with guiding, but all of us ready\nfor the manger. I leaned against _Smiler's_ sweaty chest, which looked\nas if lathered for shaving, and read the words which took me away from\nall smiling operations, almost forever.\n\n\n     \"Sudden news. Fear to be too late. All gone crooked. Tidal train\n     to-morrow. Meet me at Charing, 12.30, all packed. BAT STROGUE.\"\n\n\nShort notice indeed for so long a journey, and not a word said about\npassports. But I concluded that the old traveller would see to that\nmatter for both of us; and having long since prepared my friends, and\narranged home-affairs for a sudden departure, I was almost glad to\nexchange suspense for even headlong action. My father was kind enough to\nsay that he would do the best he could without me; and Stoneman would\neven have come with me, if his business could have done without him. My\nmother was just what a mother should be, faithful, tearful, hopeful, and\nmy sister Grace implored me to forgive sayings and doings on her part,\nwhich I had long ago forgotten. Everybody went on as if I had no chance\nof being seen alive again, and yet expressed a world of confidence in\nthe care which Heaven would take of me.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nTHE LAND OF MEDEA\n\n\nIn the days of yore, whenever any new pestilence or distemper fell from\nheaven upon the sons of men, the first thing to agitate the human mind\nwas a strong and bitter controversy. Chiron, the son of Philyra, and\nMelampus of Amythaon, instead of attacking the common foe, fell\npell-mell upon one another, maintaining or spurning their various\ndoctrines--contagion, infection, epidemism, conduction by water, by\nearth, by wind--until they were driven to run away headlong, or lie down\nforever. Such questions surpass our understanding. But one malady there\nis, contagious, infectious, endemic also as well as epidemic, grandly\ncontemptuous of pill and bolus, sticky as a limpet, while as slimy as a\nslug, and the name of this blessed disease is--\"The Blues.\" And the\nbeauty of it is, that everybody who has got it believes that he alone of\nall the people in the neighbourhood is free from every atom of a symptom\nof it.\n\nAs his luck, or perhaps mine, would have it, Strogue was in the blues,\nwhen he came to Charing Cross. He received me with a grunt, and would\nsay nothing, except to be down upon the cabman, and the porters, and\nshove his way along as if there were no English language. This is a very\nuseful way to go to work, whenever you can be quite certain that you are\nthe biggest fellow in the place, with no one to try to think otherwise.\nBut unless there is money right and left behind it, at a big railway\nstation it does not succeed.\n\n\"You are not among the niggers yet,\" I said, being always polite to\neverybody, and indignant at not being allowed to speak, while his voice\nrang along the glazing. But he deigned me no answer, not even a glance,\nbut shouted out \"Third Class! Where the devil are you driving to? Have\nyou never seen the Chairman of this Line?\" The porters were too\nwide-awake to do anything but grin, and touch their caps ironically, and\nthen he said \"First Class,\" whereupon they all believed him.\n\nNot a word however would he say to me, though we had all the carriage to\nourselves at starting; so I took him at his humour, and went to the\nother window, and drowned all my anxieties in \"The Money Market.\"\nPossibly his heart was heavy about the landlady of the \"London Rock,\" or\nthe barmaid thereof, or the daughter of the Boots, if a maiden there\nwere in that capacity; or perhaps a traveller even so well-seasoned\ncould not bid adieu to his native land once more, without emotions\nhonourable to his head and heart alike. Then the contagion of his low\nspirits began to spread around me, like the influenza vapour; and if he\nhad tried to talk, I should not have cared to answer.\n\nSuch tacit respect and mutual affability of silence do more to endear\ntwo heavy-witted Britons to one another, than a folio of flippant words.\nStrogue was kindly pleased with me, and I thought well of Strogue, when\nour lofty regard for the sea-sick passengers, as we had a rolling time\nof it, opened, as with one accord, the valves of communication. \"Give us\na light, old chap,\" said the Captain, as he clapped me on the back;\n\"come out of the sulks, and talk a bit.\"\n\nAfter all the temper he had shown, this was rather ludicrous; but I let\nhim put his own interpretation on it, for he was in this predicament for\nmy sake, quite as much as to please himself. But strange as it may seem,\nwe both avoided all important subjects, until the question of route\ncompelled us to consider them. Then I told him that money need not stop\nus, only mine must be put into proper form in Paris; and then we\ndiscussed the whole question.\n\nIt seems that he had ordered this sudden start by reason of something\nthat came to his knowledge only on the previous afternoon. In St. Paul's\nchurchyard he encountered quite by chance, according to his view of it,\na man well known through his travels in Central Asia, and most\ninteresting account of them. Strogue took him back to the \"London Rock,\"\nand there entertained him hospitably, for a traveller has generally\nacquired the power of feeding upon any wayside bench. By and by the two\ngreat wanderers came to a subject pretty sure to be handled by them, but\nnever with unanimity. Strogue thought highly of the classic charms of\nthe fair Ionian ladies; but Sir Robert B. called them a brown and skinny\nlot, and declared that there was not a girl of any Hellenic race fit to\nwalk beside a maiden he had seen at Athens, not more than a month ago,\nand who was said to be of old Caucasian lineage. Knowing that the ladies\nof the Caucasus are not much addicted to travel, the Captain began to\nenquire into this, and although he had never met Dariel, and had seen\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar at a distance only, his friend's account left him in no doubt\nwhatever that the pair he had been so vainly seeking, by letters to half\nthe capital towns of Europe, were in Athens at the end of February. Not\nonly did the description tally with all he heard from me and Nickols,\nand that scoundrel of a Hafer, but also Sir Robert, while making\nenquiries about the beautiful stranger, had been told by some facetious\nGreek that she was worthily named indeed, the daughter of Himeros, of\nlove, of passion, of delight, and yearning. And again he had learned at\nthe hotel, where they were staying, that their journey to St. Petersburg\nhad been prevented, or at any rate deferred, through the extreme\nseverity of the winter surpassing any season within memory. This I could\nwell understand, for I knew S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's dread of bad weather, not on his\nown account but lovely Dariel's.\n\nFather and daughter were still at the ancient centre of civilization,\nwhen Sir Robert left it, and their intentions were unknown to him. But\nhe was inclined to think, from certain purchases which he saw them\nmaking, that they were more likely to be on their way home than to\nproceed to Russia now, and if so there could be little doubt that they\nwould make their way first to Constantinople. Therefore it seemed to be\nour proper course, though beset with much doubt and perplexity, to\nbetake ourselves at the utmost speed to the Turkish capital, and try to\nintercept them there, or if too late for that, to follow them. For\neverything now would depend upon time. In a few more weeks the golden\nsun would have captured the mountain parapets, and begin to swing open\nwith summer light the bars of the steepest citadels; and then if S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar were a day before us, what chance of overtaking him? And his foes\nwere not likely to hold much parley, when once they found him in their\nhands.\n\nOut upon it! Who could imagine such a crime overlooked by the Power that\nrules the world? A loyal confidence possessed me for a while, that\nHeaven would protect its noblest produce, the few who ever think of\nlooking up to it, from the venom of its abject spawn.\n\n\"It will never do to take it in that light,\" said Strogue, though he\nalways attributed his own escapes, which had been manifold as well as\nnarrow, to celestial perception of his merits; \"no, you must never trust\nto that cock's fighting. Sometimes it will, and sometimes it won't. And\nwhere are you then without your revolver? And one thing you overlook\naltogether; setting aside all holy motives--which those fellows take\nrevenge to be--when a savage wants your property, does he dwell upon\nyour character?\"\n\n\"Then they ought to be all exterminated. What are the lives of a\nthousand savages, in comparison with that of one great good man, who\nlives only for their benefit?\"\n\n\"If you kill them, what good can he do them?\" Strogue asked, being\nalways more captious than logical. \"Imar is in front of his age; and the\nage makes martyrs of fellows of that kind and leaves the future to make\nsaints of them, if their ghosts turn up, within memory. Our business is\nto act, and not to argue. Now look to your luggage, my boy, and the most\nimportant part of it is firearms.\"\n\nSo we took our course along the chord of Europe by abominably slow\nlines, whenever there were any; and at last without any line at all. It\ngave an Englishman the tingles to see everybody crawling, as if time\nwere a tortoise with the gout, and the hours the produce of a coprite\nbeetle, which he slowly travels backward to bury. The slowest man on our\nfarm, after eating two days' dinner, was a swallow with a nest to feed,\ncompared to any one I saw throughout the east of Europe.\n\nThere was a little more vigour at Constantinople, and plenty of fellows\nwith fine pegs to stir, if they could only see the use of it. But as for\nany briskness, and punctuality, and eagerness to get a job and do it,\nthe loafer who stands by the horse-trough on the green in any Surrey\nvillage would have his hands out of his pockets and stand on his head,\nbefore their eyes were open. And yet we are told every day of our lives\nthat it serves the British farmer right to starve, because he has no\nactivity!\n\nWe had spent two days without any possibility of avoiding it in Paris,\nand but for Strogue it would have taken me twice as long to make the\nneedful arrangements; and now we lost four days in the City of the\nSultan, making search for our friends in all probable quarters, and\nprocuring what was indispensable. Without obtaining any further clue, we\nset forth on the 10th of April, by a poor little steamer very badly\nfound, for a place called Poti at the mouth of the Rion, one of the four\nchief rivers of the Caucasus, formerly known as the Phasis, whence the\nbird, whose lustre shames the glories of the golden fleece.\n\nStrogue had shown in very early days the quick force of his genius by\nrunning away from school, and defying pursuit, and beginning earnest\nlife in a wherry. \"You are picking up the lingoes very smart,\" he said,\nas we churned the muddy waters; \"but I can't stand affectation, George,\nand I won't have the old Ark called the _Argo_. Besides, she never came\nhere in her life; she drew a deal too much water. She went to pieces on\nArarat, I tell you, and Satan took her upper deck and put it on top of\nElbruz. Why? Why, that people might go against the Bible, as they are\nonly too glad to get an excuse to do. And he put about a story that she\ngrounded upon Elbruz, which she could not have done from the shape of\nit. No, no. Holy Writ is what I stick to, and as long as I do that, the\nLord will always stick to me. I won't hear another word about it.\"\n\nHowever, though he would not have the Argo even mentioned, he made no\nobjection to the golden fleece; in fact he confirmed it, having seen\nsome gold in the upper waters of the Rion; and as for Medea, when I told\nhim all her story, her treachery, incantations, murder of her brother\nand even her own babes, he became quite excited, and vowed that she must\nhave come to life again as the Princess Marva. Upon that I begged him to\ntell me all he knew about that extraordinary lady, for I had never\nunderstood from her brother's description that her nature was\nparticularly fierce and unforgiving, though she certainly behaved in a\ncold and distant manner, when she informed him that his wife was gone.\nBut that might arise from nothing more than the sense of the wrong she\nherself had received through her faithless husband Rakhan. And would a\nruthless woman feel such emotion at the casualty to another person's\nchild?\n\n\"Not knowing, can't say,\" the Captain answered in his favourite short\nstyle; \"but you must remember that I have not heard that story as he\ntold it. And another thing, he was not there to see it; for he was far\naway settling that other fellow's hash,--and his own too by being in\nsuch a blessed hurry. But I have got a very shrewd suspicion, my boy;\nyou will laugh at it, I dare say, and there certainly are some things\nthat pretty nearly knock it on the head. What do you say to this?\nSuppose it was her own child that was killed, and that she contrived to\nchange them, fearing that she would never have another, and so would\nlose her position altogether. For among those Ossets, as I have been\ntold, the childless wife of the chief must eat humble-pie at every\ncorner, and is apt to be superseded after six or seven years. And she\nmight have other motives too for getting Imar's heir into her\npossession.\"\n\n\"The idea is ingenious, but most improbable,\" I replied after thinking\nfor a moment. \"Not that she could not have done it, for there was no one\nto observe her, except her own nurse, whom she could easily silence. But\nher own conduct now proves that it cannot have been so. Shows that she\nhad not gone for that game, I mean. They may be a lawless lot, everybody\nsays so; but even your Medea would never send a man to marry his own\nsister.\"\n\n\"I hope not. It is too horrible to think of. Though it might be part of\nher hideous scheme for revenge. I tell you, Cranleigh, it is but a very\nstale thing to say, that a woman of the lowest depth of woman's\nwickedness is as far beneath any man's deepest pitch, as a good woman is\nabove his highest stretch. I don't go by what they tell you in the\nbooks. I have seen a big lot of men and women--civilized as they call\nthemselves, and savage; the latter on the whole more trustworthy; and\nyou know that I never dogmatise. Only a fool does that: and though I am\nan ass very often, especially when I yield to my feelings about right\nand wrong, you can't call me altogether a fool--now can you?\"\n\n\"Captain Strogue,\" I answered warmly, perceiving that he asked for it,\n\"fools are always numerous enough. But if you are one, I wish that they\nwere universal.\" And in saying this I was no hypocrite.\n\n\"There is not such a thing as a wise man now,\" he proceeded, after one\nquick glance, which showed that he liked my testimony. \"We don't want\nthem. They would never suit the age; and so the Lord abstains from\nsending them. The two or three last, who pretended to come, spent all\ntheir energy in scolding, which shows that they were not the proper\nstuff. But about this Medea--is that all you have got to say, to show\nthat she is not trying on this little game?\"\n\n\"No. I have a much stronger argument than that. No one could imagine for\na moment that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, the most benevolent man on earth, could be the\nfather of a hateful, spiteful, low-minded scoundrel, such as Hafer is.\"\n\n\"You have put it fairly. No one would imagine it; and therefore it is\nthe very thing that may be true. I am not a scholar; but such things\nhave been, and will be again, while the world endures. From bodily\nlikeness you may reason more than from the greater things you cannot\nsee. I have never seen Imar close at hand; but they are both tall,\nstrong men, straight, well-built, and active. Imar is fair you say, and\nHafer dark. That proves nothing.\"\n\n\"It is a vile idea, and I will not listen to it,\" I replied, with some\ninward sense of outrage on our race; \"I have never seen Hafer for a\nclose examination, and am not sure that I could swear to him, if he\nstood before me now. But from the glimpses I have had of him, I know\nthis--he is as different from the grand S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, as a blackberry bush\nis from a Muscat vine.\"\n\n\"Yet the one may be grafted on the other, I believe. The difficulty is\nnot concerning that, George Cranleigh; the difficulty is about the\nwoman's motives. Prove that it would suit her purposes to bring such a\nhorrible affair about, and the horror of it is no obstacle to the fact.\nWhat makes me doubt my own suggestion is, that I cannot see how the\nscheme would work for the benefit of Madame Marva. All other objections\non the score of human nature, or what human nature ought to be, are as\nnothing to the will of such a woman. Remember that she has a double\nobject--to make herself the Queen of both the tribes, and to avenge her\nhusband's death.\"\n\nWicked, and ruthless, and inhuman, as the sister of that lofty and\nnoble-minded man might be, I could not bring myself to believe her\ncapable of any such horrible design. But the misery, agony, and anxiety\nfor the pure and innocent Dariel, and her father already so cruelly\ntried by the dark decree of Heaven, also my deep and abiding fury at\nbloodthirsty treachery, and the terror of being too late for the rescue,\nall together these drove me to the verge of madness, when the rotten old\nhulk they called a steamer yawed to this side and to that, and quivered,\nand rattled, and groaned, and the decrepit engines panted, and the\ncraven crew fell upon their knees and wept; and it was announced in\nthree languages, that we had done miracles of daring, and must tempt the\nLord no longer, but thank Him for saving us from our own valour. The\nRion was in such high flood that we must cast anchor, and wait for three\ndays outside the Bar, till the rush of snow-water subsided.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nTHE LAND OF PROMETHEUS\n\n\nThere are thousands of people (Englishmen especially, and Germans\nuniversally) who would find terrible fault with me--if they ever heard\nof it--for the absence of calmness and self-command, which I ought to\nhave helped, but couldn't. Taking myself, as it ought to be, and always\nis in theory, I must have gone out of it, without asking leave, or even\nknowing that it took leave of me. Others, who have been in the like\ncondition, and perhaps they may be counted by the million, will freely\nallow for all I did, and all I said--which was a great deal worse. Even\nStrogue, though acquainted with many languages, and tolerant of all\ntheir excesses, admitted at last that there must be a power in our own,\nbeyond all foreign scope.\n\n\"You never use a wicked word,\" he said to me; \"or at any rate none that\ncould be scored against you, by any angel that understands our tongue;\nand yet you contrive to put things in such a way, that I would rather\nnot stand by you in a thunderstorm.\"\n\nThat of course was rubbish; for I spoke most mildly, and if ever I used\na strong expression, the sound of my own voice hurt me. I was trying,\nthroughout the long trial, to be of the large mind, which I admired so\nmuch whenever to be found for certain, in any human beings within my\nknowledge; and these being unsatisfactorily scarce, I went back to the\nmany I had read of, in my early days at Winchester, and did my utmost to\nbelieve in them, and shape myself accordingly.\n\nBut this was of very little help to me. Epaminondas, Timoleon, even the\ngrand Aristides, and the Roman who sacrificed his own son, were nothing\nbut shadows on a cloud, while I was the shivering form inside it.\nStrogue himself was limp and grim, and could not see how to get out; and\nit was not in his mouth to talk of angels, unless it was to give them\nmore to do. He might say what he liked, but he tried my temper, a great\ndeal more than I trespassed upon his. Moreover he had made a very\nserious mistake, and one which would probably prove fatal. If we had\nonly gone straight to Odessa, instead of losing time at Constantinople,\nwe might have been at Kutais a week ago, supposing we had caught the\nproper steamer. This he could not for a moment deny; and all he could\nsay was, that as I knew so much more about it than he did, although I\nhad scarcely heard of this part of the world before, the best thing\nwould be for me to command the expedition, and conduct it entirely in\nthe English language. But I pointed out to him that my remarks must not\nbe distorted in that manner, and that all of them were intended as\ncompliments, though he had not for the moment perceived it. Upon this he\ncame out of his anger, and said that every allowance must be made for\nme, and that if he were fool enough to be in love he should have carried\non worse than I did.\n\nAt the same time he announced, when at length and at last we had got our\n_podoroshno_--or something like that, which cost a lot of money at\nPoti--that from what he was told about the condition of the passes, his\nplan of the route must be abandoned, and we must go first to Tiflis,\nthough far to the south of our proper course. There we should get into\nthe great Russian road, which cuts the main link of the mountain-chain,\nand find a course open in almost any weather, and vehicles of some sort\nto be had for hire. Moreover it was not at all unlikely that our\nLesghian travellers might be there, waiting for the spring to tempt them\nhome.\n\nFor people in haste and having baggage, any railway (however vile and\nutterly profane, both in itself and all its consequences) is better than\nthe best carriage-road, or horse-track, likely to be found in the same\ndirection or anywhere near it. So we took to the new line (the wonder of\nthe age, to all Oriental intellects, and made as nature requires by\nEnglishmen), and instead of leaving it, as Strogue had first intended,\nat Kutais, or further on, we followed its rugged course throughout to\nthe \"City of languages,\" as the world calls Tiflis.\n\nUntil the weather becomes too hot this is the usual residence of the\nCommander-in-Chief of the Caucasus, and Strogue suggested that we should\ncall upon him, so as to start well with the authorities, in case of any\nviolence being done or suffered by us among fierce tribesmen, who might\nnot look at things as we did. For what could two men, even though of\nEnglish birth, avail among so many? Strogue himself spoke Russian very\nfairly; and even I could make out a little by this time, after taking\nmuch trouble, and undergoing a crick in the hinges of both jaws, for in\ncertain conditions of the human mind nothing seems too arduous.\n\nHis Highness Prince L. received us most politely, and at the Captain's\nrequest allowed us the privilege of a separate audience; for if it\nshould once get wind among the tribes of the upper Terek that we were\ncoming to meddle with their affairs, they were likely to show us nothing\nmore than loop-holes studded with rifle-muzzles. The Prince, who was a\nvery fine and handsome man, listened attentively to Strogue's account,\nand then (after telling us that he feared S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar was already in the\nnet and beyond our reach) he took a course which puzzled us altogether,\nand made us look rather foolish.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said with a pleasant smile, \"observe that I do not\nquestion the accuracy of your account. In fact I believe every syllable\nof it, and it confirms my own opinions. But unless you have brought me\nattested depositions, or are prepared to make them from your own\nknowledge, and recent presence on the spot, I have no power to do\nanything. Have you any such evidence to lay before me?\"\n\nStrogue shook his head, and I was compelled to do the same. \"We did not\nintend to apply to your Highness,\" I said in the best form I could\nmuster; \"that was only thought of afterwards, lest we should do anything\nagainst the law.\"\n\n\"It is fortunate for you that you have applied,\" he answered not\nunkindly. \"You are doing nothing against our law by entering the country\nwith our passports; but you are defying tribal laws, and outraging all\ntheir customs, by interfering with the private affairs of their ruling\nfamily. Have you at all considered what the result of that is? Captain\nStronger, you have travelled on those mountains. Did you find\nencouragement to treat the people thus?\"\n\n\"Your Highness, the conclusion I arrived at was--the further I keep away\nfrom all of them, the better.\"\n\n\"It was wise. It shows your great abilities. The same conclusion is\nmine; and I regret that we have been obliged to embody them. But if we\nhad not done so, it is certain that you would. But for years we must\ndeal very carefully with them. All we endeavour is to keep some sort of\norder, and encourage them to try to live without much thieving. Work\nthey will not, even for the four months, which is all the time many of\nthem could work, if they tried. Gentlemen, your sympathies are wasted in\nsuch quarters.\"\n\n\"Your Highness, I should like to shoot them all; and probably in your\nposition we should have done it.\" Strogue had not travelled for nothing,\nand he held up his thumb for me not to contradict him. \"You are the\ngreat civilizing power, as England begins at last to acknowledge. We did\nnot come here with the audacity to think that your Highness would help\nus in a private matter which does not concern your authority. But we\nknow that this Lesghian chief, although he was compelled to side with\nShamyl in his boyhood, and has paid the just penalty by long exile, is\nnow the warmest friend of your great Empire. The object for which he has\nreturned is this, to bring the barbarians into peaceful ways, and make\nthem good Russian subjects, able, and at the same time glad, to pay good\ntaxes. This gentleman with me, of the highest English family, is an\nintimate friend of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, and he will confirm every word I have said.\nSpeak up, Sir George, and tell his Highness what you know.\"\n\n\"How many times more am I to be Sir George?\" I muttered to myself in\nEnglish. And then as the Prince's eyes fell upon me, I said very\nbravely, \"It is so, your Highness.\" For everything was true, except\nperhaps about the taxes.\n\n\"And will the Commander-in-Chief allow,\" cried Strogue, getting stronger\nin his eloquence, \"a faithful and fervent Russian subject to be murdered\nby barbarous Ossets, the most cantankerous and anti-Russian tribe\nremaining in the Caucasus?\"\n\nThe Captain made a true hit here. The gorgeous decorations rose on the\nample bosom of the Prince, and his strong eyes flashed, as if in battle.\nBut a Russian of high rank keeps his head, and he answered rather\nformally.\n\n\"As I said before, I cannot interfere. But in case of any savage tumult,\nI will give you a letter to the officer on duty in the Kazbek district,\nwhich you will not present unless needful. And now, gentlemen, I wish\nyou well. You must bear in mind that you go with your lives in your\nhands, and we are not responsible. There is a little band of your\ncountrymen on the northern side of Kazbek, who hold our permission to\nquest for minerals. Two of them were frozen to death last winter,\nthrough their own imprudence. But that has not prevented more from\ncoming, in the manner of your country. You may find them of service to\nyou in the matter of supplies. Farewell.\"\n\nWe took our leave with many thanks, not daring to put any further\nquestions, although we concluded that he knew more than he saw fit to\ntell us. An officer brought us the promised letter, and looked at us\nvery curiously, as if we were even more insane than the English race in\ngeneral. I wanted Strogue to question him; but he said that it would be\na breach of etiquette, and might set the Commander against us. So we\nmade our bows, and went back to our inn, which was one of the queerest\nplaces ever seen.\n\nAnd this reminds me that I may have been expected to say something about\nthe many noble and wonderful sights of our long and tedious journey. But\nthe plain truth is, that they passed me by, without leaving any clear\nimpression, or even creating the interest which at any other time must\nhave swallowed me. I looked upon the grandest scenery of the world,\nwithout even thinking of its grandeur, caring for nothing but to leave\nit behind, as another obstacle gone by. Scarcely would I even lift my\neyes to the majesty of giant Tau, or peak that towered in dazzling white\n(like the hand of God spread on the heavens), or the sombre awe of\nmountain forest, deep with impenetrable gloom. Yet in after times all\nthese came gliding along the slides of memory, and now and then they\nstand and hold me, when I want to think of something else.\n\nBut what we had to think of now was to get along the roadless roads from\nTiflis into the black abysses and white steeps of the mountain range.\nMany of the passes still were blocked, although the strong sun scorched\nour skin, and the road was swamp or flood, whenever it was not crag or\nboulder. Strogue, being accustomed to such doings, took them with grim\nphilosophy; and I cared little what they were, except for the delay they\ncaused. The Prince most kindly sent a couple of Cossacks for our escort,\nand we had four men with their hired ponies, as well as an interpreter,\nfor Strogue might often be at fault even with the Lesghian tongue, and\nwe might visit places where that and Russian were of small avail.\n\nSo bad was the season, and the ways so roundabout and rugged, that not\nuntil the 3d of May did we enter the deep defile which leads to the foot\nof the crag of Karthlos. We threaded the narrow pass, and looked up at\nthe fearful heights, from which those playful children fell, when\nfrisking on their little legs among the treacherous snow-drift. And then\nwe saw the rocky elbow of the dark ravine where Imar's father Dadian\nfell to the stealthy shot of Rakhan. The lonely gorge, where a man felt\nhalf afraid to provoke an echo, seemed to be formed by nature for the\ndarkest deeds her sons can do. While the pale slant of declining\nsunshine, webbed with quivering vapour, here and there came partway down\nthe walls of rent and jagged rock, but nowhere reached the bottom. There\nwas not a sound to make us think of life in this unfathomable grave;\neven the Cossacks shuddered mutely under the gloomy chill of awe.\n\n\"Thank God!\" cried Strogue, when one of our horses, less romantic than\nthe rest, or lulled by power of contrast into a dream of clover, set up\na lively neigh, which rang like a peal of bells along the chasm; \"my\nson, thou shalt taste oats for that. This old hole never used to\nfrighten me. The 'London Rock' must have spoiled my nerves for rocks\nthat have got no chimneys. Here we are, George; let me see if I can\nblow. I used to know how. Or you try, if you like. You are more of a\nhuntsman.\"\n\nWe had stopped at a place where a steep, narrow channel cut the north\nwall of the gorge at right angles, and a battered old horn of great size\nhung from a staple at the rocky corner. I made a sign to him to blow,\nand blow he did, to such effect that the tattered grass, hanging here\nand there on either side of the chasm, shook as a matted cobweb shakes\nwhen a stag-beetle tumbles into it. In the midst of the solemn\ndesolation, and my own profound anxiety, I could not help laughing at\nthe Captain's face, as his great cheeks puffed with the rush from the\nlungs, and his fat chin went into plough-lines, and his grizzled\neyebrows into gables over his wet projecting eyes.\n\n\"Laugh at me?\" he said; \"then do it better.\" But I could not do it half\nas well; and we all looked vainly up the steep ascent, whose winding hid\nthe house from us--no one came, neither any answer, nor sign that we had\nmoved the air. Suddenly it occurred to me, how poor S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had stood\nwhere we were standing, and blown that very same horn in vain, with the\nflush of bright hope, and the glow of home, on the day that broke his\nlife in twain. Some men are content to accept the tricks of others and\nof fortune; not from their own want of power, but because of their\ncontempt of it.\n\nStrogue, who was not by any means of this too lofty order, glared and\nstamped, and shook his fist at all the void magnificence from which he\ncould get no response. \"Up we go,\" he said at last, \"if the mountain\nwon't come down to us--but keep your revolver ready.\"\n\nOne of the Cossacks came with us, according to his orders; the other\nstayed with the horses and their owners in the trackway. The ascent was\neasy enough for any one not encumbered with four legs, though the rope\nthat skirted the worst places was cut away, or worn out by time. And\nthen we mounted some big steps, with a slush of snow upon them, and\nstruck a heavy ring of brass upon a great gate of some dark wood. The\nmansion, or tower, or whatever it should be called, rose large and lofty\nbefore us, gazing with a dull and ancient aspect down a wilderness of\ncraggy clefts. For about a third part of the year the scene must be all\nmajesty, and for the rest all melancholy, even with life inside it. But\nnow it appeared as if it did not care for any outlook; winter or summer,\ngood or bad, could not matter much to it.\n\n\"Nobody at home. They don't keep bailiffs in this part of the world,\"\nsaid Strogue, \"or I should think some of those lovely fellows were\nhaving their steak in the kitchen. Down, George, down behind the\nparapet, or you'll never wear a hat again!\"\n\nLike an accomplished traveller, the Captain ducked his head out of shot.\nBut I was too slow and stupid, and had caught the despondency of the\nplace. \"Fire away,\" I said, \"if you can strike a light; I don't believe\nthat you can hit me.\"\n\nWant of faith is infectious, and the silver mop behind the rail, on\nwhich was resting a long brown barrel, arose very slowly, and behold, it\nwas the uncovered head of a very ancient man! Long white hair flowed\ndown his shoulders and over his breast, and I heard a hollow sigh. \"Blow\nme, if it isn't old Kobaduk!\" cried Strogue, who was taking a cautious\npeep; \"don't be in a funk, George; he knows me. Hold hard, old fellow,\nand keep your powder dry.\"\n\nThe old gentleman seemed to be in doubt about his eyes, till the Captain\nwent down a flight of steps and round towards the kitchen-entrance where\nthe ancient watchman stood. Then a few words of Lesghian passed, and\nKobaduk leaned his gun against the rail, and flung his wrinkled arms\nround the thick form of Strogue.\n\n\"Is he coming? Will he never come again?\" That much I could make out\namong his many trembling words. \"Is old Kobaduk to die without seeing\nhim? without ever hearing his voice again?\"\n\nThen he tottered to the corner of the steps, and spread his hand over\nhis brows, where the sunset struck through the glare of snow, and he\nleaned on the ramrod which he had picked up, and gazed, with his\nwrinkled eyes casting forth a bushy sparkle, down the lonely passage\nfrom the road below. \"Take it easy, old chap,\" shouted Strogue; and he\nanswered, \"I am too old to take it easy.\"\n\nThereupon his long beard fell lower on his breast, and his lips, which\nwere far out of sight behind it, mumbled some sadness which we could not\nunderstand, and he shuffled his feet to be sure that they were there,\nand made off for the kitchen-door, without another sign to us.\n\n\"Hospitable I call that,\" said Strogue; \"the poor old beggar doesn't\nknow what he is about. But we must put up here, willy, nilly, for the\nnight. We will make him rout up a bit of grub, and stir the dregs of his\nancient brain.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nAMONG THE GEMS\n\n\nThe Cossacks had discharged their duty now, after seeing us into\nfriendly hands, and in the morning they rode off to rejoin the\ndetachment at Tiflis. We sent a letter of thanks by them to the Russian\nPrince, for although we had not been molested, we owed our exemption in\nall probability to the presence of the uniform. We had passed through a\ndistrict especially delightful, even among their many happy\nhunting-grounds, to the heart of the only men among these mountains\n[unless it be the foreign gunsmiths, and a few of the timber-dealers]\nwho have a profession and practise it with any decent diligence--I mean\nthe gallant brigands. But they must not be quoted as a real exception to\nthe rule of sovereign indolence; because they are not true Caucasians,\notherwise they could never get through half of the robberies they\naccomplish.\n\nThe rest of us spent a whole day and two nights at the poor deserted\ntower, partly to refresh our horses, which were sent to the post-house\ndown below, and partly to consider our plans, after receiving from the\nancient steward the feeble light he could contribute. Although he had\nrecognised Strogue so suddenly and with such affection, he forgot him\nentirely, and with equal speed, until we began to talk in English, and\nthen he broke forth with the declaration that our language was sweeter\nto his ears than the murmur of a hive of bees breathing their last among\ntheir honey, or the first music of the waterfall that has broken the\nchains of winter.\n\nWhen Strogue translated this to me, I felt some gratifying surprise; for\nour language is not so wonderfully mellifluous, or melodious; though\nour voices are not such a cackle as theirs. But the old gentleman soon\nrevoked his claim upon my gratitude by explaining, as interpreted by\nStrogue, that the words indeed were strange and hideous, like the sound\nof a saw on a flinty rock; nevertheless, he loved them always, because\nthey brought to his mind the years that had unrolled day after day, as\nbright as the rising of the sun, and as smooth as a lake at the foot of\nthe mountains, where no wind comes blowing.\n\nI could not quite see what his wits were driving at; but Strogue, who\nhad very little reverence for anything, from seeing too much of all\nthings, sang out, \"Signor Nicolo?\" and Kobaduk took it to his heart\n(which works much longer than the brain does), and came up to us, and\ntouched both of us, with a shrivelled finger, upon either chest. \"It is\nthe name of the happy time; the time of the beautiful lady, and the\nnoble lord, and the lovely babes; and nothing to do but to laugh and\neat.\"\n\n\"And sleep,\" I suggested in his own language; and that completed his\nround of perfection, for he sent up the roots of his beard in a grin,\nand said, \"Thou hast hit the mark.\" And then he sat down upon a swab to\ndo it.\n\n\"Very fine, old codger, but beyond his time.\" Strogue gave him a tender\npoke with a stick, to make sure that he was not shamming; \"we used to\nhave faithful stuff like this in England; but education has vanquished\nit. He is sure to have a wife about twenty years old. Let us go in and\nstir her up. The wives are nothing but head-servants here. They are not\nsentimental, but they can cook, which is the highest duty of the\nfemale.\"\n\nMy feelings were shocked; but I left them so, because victuals alone\ncould relieve them. The faithful retainer had overdone himself by that\nsudden outburst of decrepit hope. But he had got a young wife, which I\nthought too bad, until she proved the contrary by making us very\ncomfortable, with a number of hot little barley-cakes, and some grilled\nkid flesh, which put a shine upon our faces. Then she poked her ancient\nhusband up, and he came and fed, and played the host, and made runaway\nknocks at the time-worn gates of his memory.\n\nThe worst of it was that we could not be sure how much truth, and how\nmuch fiction, or at any rate confusion, issued from that antique\nrepository. The older the thing was, the more it might be trusted--a\ntruth which holds good with the bulk of modern work. Whenever we brought\nhim to recent affairs, and the state of things now existing, he shook\nthe silver tissue over his bright black eyes, and stared at us. \"Kobaduk\nforgets, too long ago,\" was his chief perception of yesterday. However,\nwe fetched him nearer date, by speaking of the Princess Marva.\n\nThen the old man trembled, and turned his head away; and his fingers\n(which looked like empty bean-pods) fiddled at the cartridge loops which\nhung, like the smocking of a Surrey parish-clerk, on the quivering of\nhis sunken breast.\n\n\"For the sake of God, who made us all,\" he mumbled; and although he had\nbeen feeding well, his wife offered him some brown bits in vain. \"Let\nhim be,\" said Strogue, \"perhaps he'll have more pluck to-morrow.\"\n\nBut it did not seem to be so at all. He went up a ladder to bed that\nnight in a loft that reeked of onions, and he dragged his old gun after\nhim; but how he got his crooked knees up the rungs, and how he failed to\nshoot himself in the stomach, were difficulties not to be explained even\nby the miraculous powers of habit. \"The old cock will come down like a\nlark to-morrow,\" Strogue prophesied, as the trap-door banged. But larks\nare more famous for going up, and the Captain's prediction was about as\ncorrect as his reference to natural history.\n\n\"What a set of funks these people are! Is there no one here to tell us\nanything?\" we exclaimed almost with one accord, on the evening of the\nfollowing day, the only one we spent at Karthlos. We had asked at the\npost-house, where S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar used to keep his horses, and we had tried\nMrs. Kobaduk the fourth, and a grandson of the steward who hung about\nthe house, and a woodcutter who came home sometimes, and a fellow called\nthe huntsman, and everybody else we could come across. Most of them sat\ndown and stared at us, and feigned not to understand what we meant; and\nthen when we put the interpreter at them, all they would do was to\nshake their heads, and stretch their lazy hands westward. As for old\nKobaduk, if he was like a lark, it was one who has a skewer through him;\nand all we could get him to do was to show us where the Princess Oria\nand her baby lay.\n\nAlas, what an end for the loving and lovely, the passion of a warm life\ncold in dust, and the sad shadows creeping along the sadder grave. But I\nknew a heart in which she lived still, and a life as lovely as her\nown--were these to share her fate, or have a doom yet worse, and not\neven be restored to her in the silent home of death?\n\n\"I'll tell you what we will do, my boy,\" Strogue said to me after supper\nthat night, and after we had puffed and spat and stamped at the noxious\nvapour of the native weed (which we should have to come to in the end,\nunless our own end spared us that), the frightful stuff, grown badly,\nand cured worse, which they dare to call tobacco; \"this is a very grand\nplace in its way, and the tradition of good victuals lingers still\nabout. But the fragrance of the past is not enough for a man getting on\nin his forties. Hardships I have endured by the hundred, and could do it\nagain like Elijah; though he only went forty days, which is nothing to\nmy record. But you must understand, my son, that the fun of it is not so\nevident, when a man has got into napkin ways, and wants to lean back in\nhis chair, and think of the things he has done, instead of doing them.\nDon't be in a wax, George, I am not thinking of cutting the expedition.\nBat Strogue is made of too good stuff for that, and he means to have his\nlittle revenge as well. Only he must keep his headquarters somewhere\nwithin hail of the jack-spit. That sound has become of importance to\nhim, and his nature is not ungrateful. The world is not made of love\nalone, or precious little there would be of it. Listen to the words of\nwisdom. Men who work hard must live well. Miners work hard, therefore\nthey must live well. I never learned logic, but that sounds square.\"\n\n\"Very well, I am not going to controvert your logic. But how does it\nbear upon the present state of things?\"\n\n\"Thus, thou wooden-headed Saxon. Nicolo's fellows are at work again.\nThat much I found out yesterday; and you know the Prince as good as told\nus so. Kazbek is their diggings, a pretty large district, but not so\nextensive as Elbruz. It will be easy enough to find them out; then we\nhear a civilized tongue again, and get something civilized to put upon\nit. Here we can learn nothing; there we may get news. In the morning let\nus start for Kazbek.\"\n\nI was only too glad to have it so. For although not belonging to those\nup-and-down natures, which are either at the zenith or the nadir, I\nfound myself many pegs below the proper mark, among all this great\nbreadth and vast height, with nothing to touch, or lay hold of anywhere.\nIf Strogue was lost in sentimentality of stomach, which had been\nregarded with an excess of feminine tenderness at the \"London Rock,\" I\ncould feel for him heartily--though nobody might think it, through the\naffection of an organ of my own, which is not so far distant as the\npoets do imagine. So I said, \"You are right. We will start again\nto-morrow.\"\n\nThis we did, and our spirits began to rise, as we left that grand but\nill-fated place behind. From a rise of the mountain-track we saw it,\nmagnificent in its dark command, and vastly improved by the distance.\nAnd then we struck into the great Dariel road, the causeway of the\nCaucasus. This we followed as far as the Russian fort, where we\npresented ourselves, and our letter from the Commander-in-Chief, and\nwere entertained most hospitably. The Colonel was as kind as man could\nbe, and showed no reserve or reluctance in answering most of our\nquestions. My experience is too small to be of any value; but Strogue,\nwho had seen a great deal of Russian policy and management in the vast\ntracts added to their empire, always maintained that the common talk\nabout their grinding tyranny is jealous exaggeration; though they can be\nvery stern and hard when they meet with savage treachery, even as we\nourselves have been.\n\nAnd now this officer, a very capable, active, and intelligent man, told\nus plainly that his orders were to hold himself entirely aloof from all\nthe private feuds and quarrels among the mountain races, unless they\nrevolted, or refused to pay their very moderate taxes, or were guilty\nof open violence, or outrage upon travellers. He had heard of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar,\nas still the legitimate chief of an important tribe, for many years an\nexile now, but regarded kindly by the Government, and still in receipt\nof the larger part of his revenues through a Russian agent, who had been\nappointed upon his kinsman's death. But of his return or present\nwhereabouts he knew no more than we did.\n\nThen we asked him about the Princess Marva, and he smiled mysteriously.\n\"We don't talk of her so freely,\" he said, as Strogue still pressed him.\n\"She is a lady of very strong will, and has given us some trouble. But\nwe hope that she is improving now, and her son is a pattern of\nexcellence. If he would only take the command, which according to his\nrights he should have done long ago. But he is mild and submissive,\nthough endowed with great abilities. Many of the village headmen are\nindignant that she does not retire, for he is beloved, while she is not.\nBut we never interfere in such matters; we let them settle their own\nsuccessions. Only in case of absence, such as that of Imar--\"\n\n\"But Hafer himself has been long away,\" I interrupted him in some\nsurprise, and with faulty words, which made Strogue smile, but the\nRussian was more courteous; \"he has been for months in England.\"\n\n\"Of that I was not aware,\" the officer answered, after some reflection.\n\"But the winter has been the worst ever known, and almost all the passes\nblocked, except those we kept open. But, gentlemen, as I said before, we\ndo not interfere in private matters. You are going on, you told me, to\nthat place upon the mountain, where certain Englishmen with our\npermission are in search of minerals. They may know more about such\nmatters; for I believe that the lady has demanded payment from them, and\ndoes not recognise our licence, though Kazbek is not within her\nboundaries, or certainly not that part of it. If you will take my\nadvice, which I offer simply as a private friend, and one who admires\nEnglishmen, you will trespass as little as possible upon the domain of\nMadame Marva. I hope for the privilege of entertaining you, upon your\nreturn from the mountain.\"\n\nThis was plainly our dismissal, and his horse was waiting at the door\nfor him. So as the sun was still high in the heavens, and the weather\nvery favourable, we resolved to try to reach the mine that night, or\nrather I should say the diggings, for it had not attained the dignity of\na mine, and was not very likely to do so. We took a young goatherd for a\nguide, and leaving our horses at a hut, set forth in search of the\nemerald-hunters.\n\nAlthough we had no very great height to ascend, for the diggings were\nfar below the summit, and there was a fair track nearly all the way, and\na rope laid along the worst places, it was close upon sunset before we\nreached the magnificent gully where the miners had their camp. They were\njust leaving work for the day, and marching almost like a squad of\nsoldiers to the cells they had scooped for their dwelling-places under\nthe shelter of an overhanging crag. Each of them carried a rifle on his\nshoulder as well as a strong iron rod with a crook at the end, and a\ntool something like a spud, and a hammer with a long peak of steel. The\ncaptain, or master, or foreman, came last in the file with nothing in\nhis hands but a deep tar-pot, and he proved to be Mr. Jack Nickols, a\nsturdy young man with a round red face, active, resolute, and profoundly\ncontented with his own endowments.\n\n\"Halloa! Haven't you got a word to throw at a brother Englishman?\"\nStrogue was sadly short of breath, but still capable of indignation, as\nthese twelve or fourteen men regarded him with some suspicion, and not a\ntoken of hospitable emotion kindling in their bosoms. \"We are not come\nto steal your dirty stones, or to set up shop against you. We are of the\nhighest English birth, cousins to two Dukes, six Marquises, and a good\nround dozen of Earls. And what will touch you up more, my boys, if you\nare driven against nature to be Radicals, we have got three pounds of\nfine tobacco left; and if you are good, you shall have half of it.\"\n\nThis was an outburst of \"Altruism,\" as the people who ought to be in\nBedlam call it, which found no echo in my breast (because we were\nbeginning to smoke our ashes), but set up an irresponsible rub-a-dub in\ntheirs.\n\nWith one accord they all turned round; though bound for their suppers\n(as their mouths would have frankly declared, if sure of having more\nthan they could do with), still they proved their higher value, and\ntheir sense of the fine arts--such as we cultivate now with\npicture-frames on Sunday--by stopping and pulling out empty pipes, and\ndropping their thumbs from the barrel to the bowl.\n\n\"Plenty of time,\" said Captain Strogue, who was up to all those little\nthings; \"fine fellows all of you; but you don't get a whiff till I know\nmore about you. The laws of Great Britain hold good all over the globe,\nbecause they are righteous. You may shout in vain for Bacco, as the\nheathen gods did in their time. I am not a man of many words. We have\nhad to smoke a lot of poison ourselves, and not a blessed son of a gun\namong you tastes a shred of the genuine weed, till I have got all I want\nout of you.\"\n\nI thought that they would have turned crusty. But such misgivings showed\nthat I did not understand my countrymen. An Englishman can put up with\neverything but humbug. Bar that, and he begins to think of you.\n\n\"I want a young fellow called Jack Nickols, the nephew of my old friend,\nJemmy Nickols,\" Strogue went on with louder shouts, as he saw that the\nmen were taking to him; \"you are a rough lot, and you know it. But I\nhave been round the world seven times; and take you as you are, I would\nrather have you than any other fellows I have ever come across. You are\nno wonders, mind you; but you know what's what. And more than that, you\ndo it.\"\n\nThis was rather vague, though it sounded so precise. And I whispered to\nthe Captain, \"You are as good as John Bright.\" But he shoved me with his\nelbow, while his eloquence went down. Then the young man with the\ntar-pot came up mildly, in the presence of a larger spirit, and said,\n\"Captain, you must be the celebrated traveller;\" and Strogue looked at\nhim augustly, and said, \"Young man, you are right.\"\n\nAfter this it is impossible for me to tell the glorious night they made\nof it. They had spent all the time, when they could not work, in making\nthemselves more comfortable; and all the starvation they had been\nthrough was avenged upon itself by its own power. I have seen a good\ndeal of eating; and Strogue had both seen and done a great deal more;\nand the voice of travellers is unanimous that the Caucasian native\nacknowledges no superior in that line. It is not for me to contradict\nthem, but the impression I formed that night, and with my own mouth\nconfirmed it, was that the British settler can in that, as in less\nimportant matters, adapt himself to his environment. The sheep of the\nmountain are but small, and we furthered nature's ordinances by making\nsix, or perhaps I should say seven of them, smaller still. For the\nvalleys were spread with the verdure of spring, and it covered their\nsaddles with sweet white fat.\n\n\"One little slice more,\" Jack Nickols said; \"this is the best of the\nbatch, I know. What would we have given for a cut out of him last\nwinter! But we were obliged to leave this place altogether. Forty feet\ndeep the snow was here, and not a bit of firing to be got for love or\nmoney. You heard that two of us were frozen to death; but we never lost\na man. We set that story going, and it did us a lot of good, and choked\noff another lot who wanted to come here. We have got it all to ourselves\nat present, and mean to keep it. You saw my tar-pot. Capital plan. An\ninvention of my own. We have scarcely gone underground at all as yet. We\nscratch the crannies, and the dribble-places, and I stand by and watch\nevery fellow. Wonderfully honest, and all that, no doubt; but just as\nwell to look after them. Every bit of green they find, I drop it in the\ntar. They can't get it out again, even if they could find it, without\ntelling tales on their fingers. Nine out of ten are not worth keeping;\nbut we have got a few real beauties. There is one stone I wouldn't take\na hundred pounds for, and a lot worth more than fifty. I'll show you\nsome of them by daylight. It's the flaws, the flaws that murder them.\"\n\n\"We don't know anything about stones,\" replied Strogue, \"and I would\nrather look through a good green bottle than all the emeralds that ever\ncame from Peru, or wherever they get them. What we want to talk about is\nquite another pair of shoes, and I know you will help us if you can. We\ngave you that letter from your uncle. He will be out here this summer if\nhe can. But we cannot wait for that. We must set to work at once. When\nthe rest are gone, I will tell you all about it.\"\n\n\"We will go outside, if you don't mind. I can show you a very cosy place\nwhere we do our cooking, and the ashes warm the rock all night. Let us\nhave our pipes there, and leave the tag-rag here.\"\n\nWe followed him gladly to the open air, and sat upon some bear-skins in\na snug alcove of rock, with the stars shining on us, and the embers of\nthe fire doing better service still. And here we told young Jack Nickols\nall our story, a great part of which he must have known already.\n\n\"You will never go home alive,\" he said, \"if you are going to meddle\nwith that woman. Let her have her own way. She always does. What right\nhave you to conclude that she wants to murder her own twin-brother? It\nis likely enough, mind, from what you say, and in fact I have little\ndoubt about it. But for all that, you don't actually know it, and if you\ndid you are not the Russian Government. Let her alone, for God's sake.\"\n\nWe told him that this was the very thing we had sworn to ourselves we\nwould never do; and that he must stand by us, like an Englishman, and\nlike his uncle's nephew. \"Stand a long way off more likely,\" he replied,\n\"though I don't call myself a coward, and I hate that woman. But I will\ntry to contrive something, and let you know to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nQUEEN MARVA\n\n\nDiscovering nothing of any kind, concerning S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar and his daughter,\nafter they had quitted Athens, we made up our minds that the proper\ncourse was to pay a visit to the Princess Marva, and try to get some\ninkling of her plans. It was not very likely that a couple of clumsy\nfellows, like Strogue and my humble self, would prove a match, or even a\nserious check, for a subtle and ruthless woman, commanding a reckless\ntribe, and probably well informed of all the plans of her unsuspicious\nvictims. So that if we appeared in our own characters, or even let her\nknow that we were here, our days in this land, or indeed in any other\nvisible except to the eyes of faith, were likely to be brief indeed.\n\nBut for the sake of those who mean well, and desire fair play on the\nwhole, whenever it leaves a chance for them, Providence has been\ngracious enough to lay down one universal rule--that every wicked person\nhas some special weakness, some nick in his black shell for the\noyster-knife of justice; so that a simple and straight mind, like\nStrogue's and mine, may find its way through, and turn the whole to\nrighteous uses.\n\n\"I have hit the mark,\" Jack Nickols said, when he came home to breakfast\nwith his tar-pot; \"when the sun comes up these rattling peaks, instead\nof down over them, is the time to think. I could not see things clear\nlast night, though you know how little I take, Captain, compared with\nanybody else about. But when the sun came up from under to me, my\nbrains, which are bright now and then, began to work. I thought of you\nsnoozing in the ashes, and I resolved to do my best for you.\"\n\n\"Go on, my son,\" said the Captain kindly, with the tolerance of a\ngentleman who is offered lager-froth, instead of solid Bass; \"there is\nno doubt that you have fine ideas. A man who turns out so early picks up\nsomething.\"\n\n\"Then what do you say to this?\" cried Jack. \"You might roll over fifty\ntimes, till nine o'clock, as old gentlemen do in England, and yet never\nfind it occur to you. That Clipper of the mountains\"--\"Cleopatra\" was\nthe word in his mind perhaps--\"is a terrible oner for money, they say,\nand we have had a tip or two to that effect. Till we paid her toll,\nthough it is robbery downright, a bullet used to come from some black\ncorner, and my very best hand had a sample through his hat. One must\nexpect that sort of thing of course, in an out-of-way part of the world\nlike this; but luckily they have never been at Wimbledon. I came very\nnear the Queen's Prize once; but I told you all about that, last night.\nThese beggars won't give me a chance. Never mind, it will come some day.\nBut they haven't tried to pot us, since we paid toll. Now why shouldn't\nyou go upon the same tack? Go to Her Majesty, as an opposition company,\nand offer a premium over our heads.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, you are a clever fellow,\" said Strogue, looking at him\nthoughtfully; \"I fancied so when I saw the tar-pot. But, Jack, my dear\nboy, is there any foundation, anything for us to go upon?\"\n\n\"Yes, there is. And we can make much more of it. I can promise you an\ninterview with the tigress, if you will offer to put stripes of gold on\nher. You know what those confounded Germans are. No sooner do they hear\nof any English enterprise than they want to go one better and collar it.\nThey come in, and hoist us out, and get the cream of all our sweat.\nThere was a tremendous man of science, Herr Baddechopps, or Baddechumps,\nor some such name, poking about here with spectacles last autumn; I have\ngot his card, and you shall have it. We put a rope round him, and two\nmen at either end, and swept him down the hill faster than he came up,\nand we promised him the loop round his neck if he came back; for I can't\nstand their jealousy of everything we discover! You go and tell Marva\nthat we have got the place too cheap; that it all belongs to her, and\nyou will pay three times the royalty. Take a notary with you, but sign\nnothing.\"\n\n\"George, I am up for trying it, if you are,\" said Strogue. \"What is the\nname of her place--Gomorrah? Doesn't sound very inviting, does it? But\nthe lady won't hurt us, if we leave our cash behind. We can get there in\nthree days, you said last night. Let us beard the tigress in her den. I\nhave never been quite in that part before. There is no such thing as a\nroad, of course. All the better for that sometimes.\"\n\nNickols advised us to take no horses, lest we should be murdered for\ntheir sake; but to hire a guide, and a tent, and half-a-dozen of his men\n(whom he would try to spare), as well as our own interpreter, and a\nTartar or two who were always hanging about the Russian fort. Thus we\nshould be ten or twelve in number, all well-armed, and capable of giving\na good account of some thirty Ossets, if they took our expedition\nroughly; for they are not good shots, and their guns are very poor.\n\nWe spent that evening in consultation, receiving many hints from our\nyoung friend, who would have been glad to join us, if the state of his\nwork had allowed it. But his mate, as he called him, was away, and so he\ncould not well leave the diggings; moreover, there would have been some\ndanger that he might be recognised, which would prove fatal to our case\nat once. Yet he promised to help us with all his force, in any great\nemergency, if we could only give him notice in good time, and this was\nof no less value to us than a troop of Cossacks. Meanwhile he would send\nto make inquiry at Vladikaukaz, the chief town on the north, which\ntravellers from Russia would be almost sure to pass, whether our friends\nhad been heard of there. And so, with many thanks, we left him for the\npresent, and spent a day at Kazbek village, preparing for our visit to\nthe Princess Marva.\n\nAgainst so fierce an enemy, and with so good an object, our stratagem\nfor obtaining an audience was fair enough; but to use the German\nprofessor's card seemed to me far beyond the most elastic stretch of\nhonesty; so I threw it into the fire, to save argument, for Strogue\ntook a different view of the case. \"You may take the lead, and you may\ncall yourself a German,\" I told him resolutely; \"I am a silent partner,\nand it does not matter who I am. The lady speaks better French perhaps\nthan you do, and certainly much better than I do. You do all the\ntalking, and I nod my head. Cator is drawing up the rough agreement,\nwhich we submit for her consideration. The beauty of it is, that if in\nher greed she even gives a nibble at the bait, we can dangle it ever so\nlong before her, and are sure to find out something of what we want to\nknow. Cator must put it as vaguely as he can, and leave the royalty\nblank for us to fight about.\"\n\nCator was one of Jack Nickols' men, a sharp and well-educated youth, who\nhad been in a lawyer's office, but found a lack of bracing qualities in\nthe air, and left his stool in search of them. And now we gave him a\ndouble fee to prepare a document and enact the lawyer's clerk at our\ninterview, for men of law were almost as rare as men of medicine in\nthese parts. A formidable deed it was, with half-a-dozen seals to it,\nand we wrapped it round a straight black horn from some sheep or goat of\nthe mountains.\n\nThe roads were bad, being over-metalled by the melting of the snow. For\nthe roads are the river-courses, and when nature lays too much water on,\nit is not easy to get along them, even the right way of the grain. And\nour course now was against the grain, towards the head springs, or\nmother glaciers of the river Terek; which would have conducted us, when\nin a proper mood, but now knocked us back again, with a gruff and grey\nadversity. Neither was there anything for the eyes to spread their rims\nat, and make light of all the discontent of legs and back. All was dry\nrock, except where it was wet with dribble, or dirty with reek of thaw;\nand there was scarcely a tree to wipe the air, or show what way the wind\ncame.\n\nNevertheless we strove along, following our guide, who cared much more\nabout putting his own feet right than ours. For these men are not like\nthe Alpine guides, whose loyalty is more to them than money. At length,\non the third afternoon, we stood before a strange place, which I cannot\ndescribe, nor even give a rough idea of it, unless I may compare it with\na great pile of big dominoes, set at any angle, some on end, and some on\nedge, on the top of a black pillow bolt-upright. And this was the\nfortress of the Osset Queen.\n\nWe sounded a trumpet, but received no answer. And then we made a\nrub-a-dub on a goat-skin drum, which was hanging on a stump for\nvisitors. And when we left off, we heard a screech of metal going\nrustily and heavily upon its hinges. Then a muzzle, as big as a small\nchurch bell, came out, and we thought it was all up with us.\n\nBut Strogue, like a brave man, waved a white handkerchief on the screw\nof his ramrod, and we pushed the interpreter foremost, though it\nrequired three men to do it. What he said was beyond me altogether,\nthough crowded with illustrious but anxious words. And if words were\never known to afford relief, it is fair to acknowledge that they did so\nthen. The great muzzle which commanded all our bodies, so that to fly\nwas hopeless, sank upon its pivot--or whatever it might be--and a\nladder, which had been out of sight behind a buttress, came sliding down\nthe base to meet us. \"One man first\" was the order from the loop-hole;\nand every one of us quite admitted his friend's claim to precedence.\n\"Can die but once,\" cried Strogue; \"here goes.\" Upon which I felt my\ncheeks burn, and said, \"Let me.\" But he answered, \"No, you shall come\nnext, my son.\"\n\nThe Captain went up heavily, with the scroll upon his back, and the\nfour-chambered \"bull-dog\" in his left breast-pocket; and we saw two men\nreceive him on a narrow parapet, and he waved his hand to us to indicate\nall right. Then he vanished round a corner, and we waited for some\nminutes, having found a little shelter where it would take some time to\nshoot us. We assured one another very strongly that if anything happened\nto Captain Strogue, we would not be satisfied with avenging him, but\nwould have the whole place down, and a British fleet in a position to\nrake all the Caucasus, when to our great relief he appeared again at the\nhead of the ladder and shouted, \"Three more fellows may come up now.\"\nThis time, I was the foremost to run up. Not that I was really afraid\nbefore; only that I waited to know what the others thought, as a man of\nmodesty and deliberation does, when the circumstances are unusual. Cator\nfollowed readily, and so did another of Jack Nickols' men; but the\ninterpreter said that we should find him more useful at the bottom of\nthe ladder. \"She is a stunner, and she has got a stunning place,\"\nStrogue whispered to me, as he led us through a dark passage into a long\nlow room; \"she beats the Begum all to fits.\"\n\nWhat Begum he meant I could not tell, having heard him speak of several\nwhose hearts he had broken in his early days. But if he meant some\nregal-looking woman, he was not beyond the mark in his comparison. For I\nhad never beheld one so stately and grand as the lady who now received\nus with a slight inclination, reflected by the polish of the black\nwalnut table before her. She was sitting in a chair of purple velvet\nwith a leopard's skin thrown over it, and her dress was of soft maroon\nbrocade, with white fur trimmings at the neck and wrist, and a gold\nchain flowing upon her full broad bosom. There was not a wrinkle or a\nspot to mar the shapely column of her neck, or the firm sleek comeliness\nof her face; and her eyes, if there had only been some sweetness in\nthem, would have been as lovely as they were splendid. Her complexion\nwas darker than S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's, and the lineaments more delicate, so that\nher face excelled his in perfection of form, as the feminine face should\ndo. But as to expression, the gentler element was by no means in its\nduty there; for the aspect was of one who scorns, mistrusts, and repels\nall fellow-creatures, and sees the evil in them only.\n\n\"These, then, are the members of your company, Herr Steinhart,\"--she\naddressed herself to Strogue, after one flashing glance at each of us,\nas we entered, and her French pronunciation was a little too good for me\nto follow all of it, though she did not infuse much nasal twang; \"and it\nis your opinion that I am deluded by those who are working my mines at\npresent?\" _My mines_ indeed, how grand! I thought; what would the\nRussians have to say to that?\n\n\"I never speak ill of the poor,\" replied Strogue, \"and we must make\nevery allowance for the British audacity, your Highness. All cannot\nafford to pay as we can, for the reason that they have not our enormous\ncapital at command. We always find it the wisest course to treat the\nlandowners liberally. We make no pretence to be better, more honest or\nmore generous, than those Englishmen. Your Serene Highness, although so\nyoung, has had sufficient experience of the world, to know that all men\nare by nature rogues.\"\n\n\"My faith, but it is true! How seldom, though, have the men the good\nmanners to acknowledge that! Rather do they not put the fault upon the\nmore simple and righteous sex?\"\n\n\"Your Serene Highness,\" Strogue answered gravely, seeing that this title\nwas not ungrateful, \"the ladies perceive at once that they are grossly\nwronged; but they are too magnanimous, too regardless of gain, to\nremonstrate. You, for example, how much do you care? You have ample\nrevenues from your sovereignty, and things that occur on the back of a\nmountain are of small account to you. Nevertheless the right is right,\nand it ought to be defended.\"\n\n\"And the right shall be defended, when it is my right,\" said the lady;\n\"I am not accustomed, as you well observed, to the smaller business,\nHerr Steinhart; but those who defraud me suffer for it. Make your offer,\nif you please, more intelligible.\"\n\nThis was the very thing we did not want to do, having no offer of any\nkind to make. But Strogue had gone far enough, and wide enough, to know\nthat a question is answered best by another question.\n\n\"Is it possible that your Serene Highness will oblige us with the amount\nwhich those arrogant Englishmen have been in the habit of contributing\nto your lofty revenues? We are a wealthy company, but we cast away no\nmoney.\"\n\n\"It is just,\" she replied, \"and my desire is for justice. This is what\nthey pay me now. But they would have to double it for the coming year.\nThe trumpery sum of two hundred roubles. With you I will not treat for\nless than a thousand, and for one year only at that price.\"\n\n\"Your Highness is very just and moderate,\" said Strogue, while I turned\naway to hide my indignation, and sadness, that a woman so magnificent\nshould stoop to such a lie; for I knew that Jack Nickols had paid her\nonly twenty roubles, to last for two years, as she had no title there\nwhatever. \"But your Highness will pardon me for mentioning that we have\nheard a rumour, perhaps an absurd one, that a brother of yours, a great\nLesghian chief, who was banished by the Russians, is now returning to\nhis country, and may claim his rights over that desolate spot, and\nfinally establish them. In that case our lease from your Serene Highness\nmight not be so valuable as we were led to hope.\"\n\nA deep colour flushed, or I might say flashed, into the clear dusk of\nher cheeks, and a brilliance into the darkness of her eyes. Then she\nplaced the long oval of her smooth plump hands (which reminded me of\nDariel's, but were half again as large) on the black walnut wood before\nher, and gazed at the Captain, till he scarce knew where he was. Then\nshe turned her eyes on me, with contempt subduing anger.\n\n[Illustration: \"_Gazed at the Captain till he scarce knew where he\nwas._\"]\n\n\"If you think to defraud me by such pretences,\"--as she spoke she rose,\nand her head towered over the dumb-foundered Strogue's, and Cator's\nalso,--\"it would have been better for you, if you had remained at the\nfoot of my hospitable ladder. As to the chances of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's\ninterference, you shall have the evidence of Prince Hafer. His signature\nalso you shall have. I will produce him to you.\" With swift yet\ndignified steps, she left the long gloomy room, and we stared at one\nanother.\n\n\"Better cut and run, if they have left the ladder there,\" Strogue\nwhispered, for several men now occupied the doorway; \"it is all up, if\nHafer sees us. I made sure from what they told us that he was miles\naway. What's the good of four of us?\"\n\n\"They can shoot us all the easier, if we run,\" I said; \"let us have it\nout here, if it must be; this thundering walnut table makes a grand\nbreastwork. After all, they may not want to fight us.\"\n\n\"We can settle at least half-a-dozen of them;\" Cator's eyes shone with\nlegal pugnacity, \"four Englishmen can lick a score of Ossets.\"\n\n\"Not if they are like that man,\" said the fourth of us, Tommy Williams,\npointing to the door, which was not a door (as the old joke has it),\nneither could it be a jar, but looked more like a bed-curtain. The\nlintel was appointed for men of good stature, and I had passed beneath\nit without much bend; but the young man, who made his entry now, was\nabove any moderate stature of mankind, as he promised in breadth to\nout-do them. In a flash of thought, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar stood before me, as I first\nbeheld him. \"Has that woman killed him, and is this his spectre?\" I\nasked myself, as I fell back, and stared.\n\nDark as the room was, another moment showed me the excited wandering of\nmy wits. This was not S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's face, but one of similar comeliness,\nwithout his resolution behind it. A gentle, pleasant, large, and kindly\ncountenance as his was, but with very sad placidity, and no strong will\nto enforce its lines. The face of a man who can be trusted to do you no\nwrong, and never to stop any other man from doing it. Like that of the\nfriends we value most, when our little world goes smoothly.\n\nHe came to the table, behind which we had posted ourselves for a\ndesperate stand, and there he bowed very gracefully to us, and then\nlooked round for his admirable mother, as if he were quite at a loss\nwithout her. Strogue, in his polite way, asked in English, \"Who the\ndevil are you, sir?\" The young giant looked at him, and shook his head,\nlike a stranger to our fine language. \"No fear; he won't fight,\" the\nCaptain cried to comfort us; and we all took our hands from the triggers\nin our pockets.\n\nHis golden curls were waving still--for he had the finest crop that I\never did see--and he was looking at us calmly, and as we thought with a\nsweet and hospitable intent, when back came the lady almost with a rush,\nand tokens of fury on her too expressive face. She had not meant her son\nto come in without her; and we smiled among ourselves, as we thought how\nhe would \"catch it,\" by and by at any rate, if not in our presence.\nHowever, she controlled herself, and introduced him grandly.\n\n\"Gentlemen, this is my son Prince Hafer, who will add his signature to\nmine, to remove all your hesitation, if the terms you propose should be\nsuitable. Also he will confirm my declaration that my brother S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar\nwill raise no claim to the valuable mines you propose to rent from me.\nThe Prince is capable of speaking French; though not perhaps with my\nfacility. Your concession, which I have perused, is in French, but the\namount of your payment is not yet stated. It will be useless to say less\nthan one thousand roubles, five hundred of which must be paid in\nadvance. Herr Steinhart, I am not a lover of money; but I must insist\nupon my son's rights. Do you consent to the sum I mention?\"\n\nStrogue looked at me, and then at Cator. Intending no business, but only\na sham for the purpose of seeing the lady, and hearing something about\nher brother, he was taken aback at this close issue, especially the\ndemand for a large payment on the nail. Moreover, his mind was in sad\nconfusion, and so was mine, I must confess, about the existence of two\nPrince Hafers, while we durst not even hint at any explanation. But\nCator was quicker, and more ready with a quiddity.\n\n\"Your Highness,\" he said, \"as the legal adviser of this wealthy company,\nI may say that we shall not object to the rent you reserve, nor to the\nprepayment, which to us is a trifle below consideration. Only I should\ntake a note of guarantee from your Highness, and also from Prince Hafer,\nagainst interference on your brother's part. That will have to be\nembodied in this instrument, which moreover has not as yet the necessary\nstamp. You have already given us your full assurance. If the Prince in\nmy presence will add his, according to your proposition, I will put them\ninto legal form.\"\n\n\"Bravo, Cator!\" cried that stupid Strogue in English. \"Did you speak,\nsir?\" asked the Princess. \"Your Serene Highness, I am afflicted with a\ncough,\" the Captain replied, with his hand before his mouth.\n\n\"My son,\" said the lady, looking steadily at Hafer, \"oblige me by\nsitting down in that chair. It is one of my afflictions, gentlemen, that\nhe is not always in strong health. But he is the delight of all our\ntribe; so amiable, so just, so generous! Now,\" she continued, with her\nback towards us, so that we could not see the expression of her eyes,\n\"assure these gentlemen, my dear son, of your certain knowledge that\nPrince Imar will never set foot upon Kazbek again.\"\n\n\"I have no knowledge. I have never seen him. His doings are unknown to\nme. I cannot affirm at all where he is.\" As the Prince spoke, in French\nrather worse than my own, he began to tremble violently, and his eyes\nturned away from his mother's face.\n\nWe saw her place one hand below her solid breast. And then she said,\ncoaxingly as we thought, \"The poor dear, what an affliction it is! But,\nmy son, you can give us your firm belief that he will never tread the\nmountain of Kazbek any more.\"\n\n\"He will never tread that mountain any more,\" the young man replied in a\nlow sad voice; and then he broke into a torrent of tears.\n\n\"Excuse me, gentlemen. It is most grievous. From a child he has suffered\nfrom these heart-attacks. Oh, the unfortunate mother that I am!\" As she\nspoke, she was leading him out of the room; and we drew aside\nrespectfully.\n\nBefore we had time to discuss this scene, her ladyship returned with\nsome tears in her eyes, which made her look strangely beautiful. \"I\nthank you for your most kind sympathy,\" she said, \"and will not detain\nyou any longer. If you will put all into proper form (for even in\ntrouble such things must be seen to), and return with the 500 roubles\nand the deed, if it may be this day-week, I will grant all your desires.\nTill then, farewell.\"\n\nWith silent salaams we took our leave, and were shown forth, not from\nthe rock-front of the castle, but through a narrow passage, or gallery,\ncut in the crag, and provided with iron doors. And the Ossets who\nconducted us could not be tempted to open lips, or to make a sign.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nWOLF'S MEAT\n\n\nThus far Cator, the attorney's clerk, had proved himself the most\nsagacious and quick-witted of our party; though Captain Strogue would\nhave been amazed and indignant to hear me say so. And now, when we had\nrejoined the rest of our little expedition, and all were recruiting the\ninner man (or the middle man perhaps he is, body being first, stomach\nsecond, and mind--when found, third portion), that sprig of the law came\nup, with a bone between his teeth, and begged the Captain and myself,\nwho were feeding from the outside tops of our hats, to go a little\nfurther round the elbow of a crag. There he asked us what opinions we\nhad formed; and when we had taken our seats, we said: \"None at all;\nexcept that we are all bamboozled.\"\n\n\"No doubt about that. But how, and why?\" He answered with a mysterious\nlook, which we were inclined to smile at, not having known him long\nenough to be sure of his prophetic gifts. \"A lot of things have occurred\nto me, which may be very absurd of course, and it is not likely that all\nare right; but I am pretty sure that some are. Shall I tell you, and\nhear what you think of them?\" We lit our pipes, and nodded to him, and\nsmiled at one another.\n\n\"To begin with, then, I suspect most strongly that her Majesty, the\nDevil's wife, for so she deserves at least to be, has got her brother\nunder lock and key somewhere, snug enough, and at her mercy, if she owns\nsuch a quality. Did you see what she touched, when she went to gag, and\nat the same time to cram, that poor young fellow, whose will she has\ncrushed out of him by years and years of bullying? Perhaps you could\nnot see where you stood; and she did not think that I could. But I saw\nthe tips of her long fingers playing with a key which was in her belt--a\nmere household key of course--but enough to remind her unlucky son where\nhis poor Uncle was, without much chance of ever coming forth, but in his\ncoffin. And I caught a glance of his which proved that he understood her\nmeaning, and might soon have the same thing for himself. And then you\nsaw how he broke down; for he is a very tender-hearted youth.\"\n\n\"By Jove, it sounds uncommonly like it; I was so taken aback,\" said\nStrogue, \"at seeing another Prince Hafer in the field, and so different\nfrom my Simon Pure, that I could not notice small things much; and\nperhaps it was the same with Cranleigh. There is some abominable villany\nat work, and we shall be too late to stop it. I would like to insure\nfriend Imar's life for ten thousand at five thousand premium. Go on, my\nson, thou speakest well.\"\n\n\"Another thing, according to my lights. He is not in that queer old\nplace at all, Gomorrah Castle, or whatever they call it, although there\nare plenty of black holes there, enough to starve a regiment man by man.\nNo, he is away to the North at present, perhaps on the other side of the\nmountains. You saw the big window that faced the North, more like a door\nthan a window it was. Well, every time her brother was in question, and\nespecially when she was fingering that key, she gave a quick glance\nthrough that window, very likely without even knowing it. People who\ngesticulate much often follow it up in that way. When they speak of a\ndistant thing, they glance in that direction, if they can see it, or\nanything anywhere near it; and there was a great double-peaked mountain\ncovered with snow, like a white mitre, stuck against the sky in the\nNorth. And if her brother had been in the castle dungeons, she would\nhave made us go down the front ladder again, instead of getting a wink\nof back premises.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, this boy is wide-awake, considering how little he has\nseen yet of the world. Cator, like Cato, thou reasonest well. Go ahead,\nmy son, we hearken thee.\"\n\n\"You see, Captain,\" said the young man, feeling abashed in the presence\nof such renown, and doubtful about some chaff in its palm; \"you see, I\nshould never care to offer you advice. It might be in place with Mr.\nCranleigh here, because he is only a young beginner. But you know what's\nwhat, I should say, ever so much better than I do. But as you tell me to\ngo on, I will. Her Serene Highness intends to make away with her\ntwin-brother, on Monday next.\"\n\n\"Come now, come now! I can stand a great deal, Cator. And none of your\nbutter-Scotch--no, you are a Shropshire man, you say. Whatever you are,\nit won't make that go down. Why, Old Moore, and Zadkiel would be nothing\nto you.\"\n\n\"Captain, I will tell you what I go by, and then you'll be able to judge\nfor yourself, whether I talk bunkum, or good sense. I have been in these\nparts for a twelvemonth now, and I ought to know something of these\nblessed natives. There are no two lots of them quite alike, any more\nthan two mountains or two valleys are. But there is not a pin to choose\namong them in the matter of laziness. Poor beggars, they can scarcely\nhelp that, I dare say, frozen as they are for half the year, and roasted\nfor the other half. Well, about here the manner is to keep three\nholidays, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, just as if they did anything on\nthe other four days. These Ossets about here have no religion of any\nsort worth speaking of. Some call themselves Christians, some\nMahometans, many are simple idolaters; but all are full of superstition,\nas such people must be. All they do in the religious way, is to stick to\ntheir fasts and festivals, particularly the festivals. And their great\nfestival of the year finishes up next Sunday.\"\n\n\"What the deuce has that got to do with it?\" Strogue enquired\nimpatiently, for the sun was beginning to slope along the valley, and we\nhad ten miles to go to the next covered place.\n\n\"Everything, if you will hear me out. That festival goes on for three\nweeks; and during that time it is not lawful to follow up even the\nblood-feud. But on Monday, it will be the proper thing to stick and stab\nall who are waiting for it. And what makes me think that this little\ngame is on, according to institution, is that we have not seen a living\nsoul, except an old woman and a child or two, in the miserable villages\nwe have come by. Why? For the very simple reason that every noble savage\nwho can swing a dagger is off for this great act of faith on Monday; to\nsee the death of the head of the clan avenged.\"\n\n\"I won't believe a word of it,\" I exclaimed, meaning no rudeness of\ncourse to Cator, but scouting the possibility of such fiendish\nabominations, after all I had heard of the great man's lofty hopes and\npure ideals.\n\n\"To me it seems likely enough,\" said Strogue. \"I have been among fellows\nwho would eat their mothers, and serve up their own babies for a\ngarnish. We have none of that sort to deal with here; and the men of\nthese mountains, taking them all round, are an indolent rather than a\ncruel lot. Quarrelsome of course, and hot of blood, but most loyal to\ntheir chiefs, and very generous sometimes. It is the blood-feud that\nmakes devils of them; but how can they help that? It is their test of\nhonour, ever since they came out of the Ark with the raven. What we have\ngot to do is to act exactly as if all our friend Cator suggests were the\nfact. Thursday to-day; there is little time to lose, even if we can\ncatch it up at all. We shall want every son of an emerald of you; and\nyou must fight like sons of the Emerald Isle. By Jove, what a ripping\nturn-up it will be! Right about face, quick march for Kazbek!\"\n\nIt was all very well for him, and Cator, and the rest to take things\nlightly thus. They could not be expected to feel much concern for the\nLesghian Chief, or a Lesghian lady even more adorable. And as for\nStrogue his main object was less to rescue S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, than to wreak his\nown vengeance upon Hafer--that is to say the London Hafer, the one who\nhad leaped the ivied wall, and shot at me, and robbed the Captain, by\nsome blackleg's process, of \u00c2\u00a3300.\n\nBut I (with my warm affection and deep pity for the father, and\npassionate love of the daughter) could see no adventurous joy or fierce\ndelight in the issue impending. I wanted no revenge, no compensation for\nanything done against me. Hafer the genuine, and Hafer the counterfeit,\nmight settle their claims to the title as they pleased; even that most\nmalignant and awful woman--if she were as black as she was painted--the\nPrincess Marva might live her life out, and give the best account of it\nwhen her time came; if only she could be kept from harming her relatives\nso innocent. There must be in her motives something more than we could\nsee. Revenge alone for the loss of a husband, with whom she had lived on\nthe worst of terms, and who had wronged her on the tenderest\npoint--that, and the time-worn grievance about the refusal of her\nmarriage-portion were not enough to drive her to such a horrible and\nunnatural deed as--unless we wronged her most shamefully--she was now in\ncold blood designing. There must be some other strong motive too, some\ngreat temptation of self-interest, some of that stern, sour stuff which\ndrives us out of the hive that should be sweet to us.\n\nNo man knows what he does or thinks (unless he can keep himself separate\nfrom the thoughts of all around him, which requires a wonderful nature)\nwhen his legs go along with the legs of other men, and he has to swing\nhis arms accordingly. There was no sort of march among us; for we had\nnever been even of the Volunteer Force (except myself, and that only\nmade me critical, without any help in it), and if we had wanted to show\nthe Caucasus any sense of drill, we could never have done it, even if we\nhad known how. By order of the rocky way, or of rocks without any way\namong them, we could never march two abreast, or even three in file with\ndecency. All we could do was to get along, and admire one another's\nclumsiness.\n\nThen we came to a place with a sudden gap in front, and nothing but the\nsky beyond it. A cleft in the crown of a rugged ascent, with spires of\nblack rocks right and left. And there on the saddle-ridge that we must\npass, a gaunt and wondrous figure arose, whether of man or of beast, and\nwavered against the grey mist of the distance, and swayed. Two long\narms, like a gallows out of gear, or a cross that has rotted with its\nweight, struck up; and having been severely tried already we were much\nat a loss what to make of it. There was good light still, and we were\nnot to be frightened, as we must have been after sunset; but the\nInterpreter being always nervous turned round, and exclaimed: \"She has\nsent the Devil, the Devil himself, to stop us.\" While he spoke the long\nfigure fell down on its knees, and swung its lank arms, like a windmill.\n\n\"Hold hard! Don't fire!\" Strogue shouted sternly, as some of our men\nhad brought their guns to bear. \"Idiots, it is nothing but a poor lost\nman, a fellow without a bit of food inside him. George, let us go and\nsee what he is up to.\"\n\nI was ready to go anywhere and do anything in my present state of mind;\nand when we came up to him, our poor brother mortal fell upon his face,\nand put his hands upon our feet. He muttered some words which we could\nnot understand, and then he opened his mouth, which was very large, and\npointed down it intelligibly to the slowest comprehension.\n\n\"He may be the Devil, but he wants some grub,\" Strogue shouted back to\nour company, who were still looking towards us doubtfully, for people\nbecome superstitious, without intending it, in these wild places. Then\nCator came up, with a barley-cake in one hand and his rifle in the\nother. The unfortunate starver took no heed of the weapon in his\nextremity, but stretched his shrivelled arm across the muzzle, and tore\nthe cake from Cator. In a moment it was gone, almost without a munch;\nand then he stared at us, with sun-scorched eyes projecting from their\npeel like a boiled potato,--and groaned for more, crooking his fingers\nlike prongs of a rake. We shrank from him so that he might not touch us.\nBut for the blood he was covered with we should have taken him for a\nskeleton; and but for his groans and nakedness we should have passed him\nas a scarecrow.\n\n\"Don't be in such a hurry, old chap, or you'll do yourself more harm\nthan good,\" Strogue suggested reasonably. But even if the other had\nunderstood, it would have made no difference. He spread his face out in\nsuch a manner that there was nothing left but mouth; as a young cuckoo\nin a sparrow's nest, when his stepmother cannot satisfy him, squattles\nhis empty body down, and distends himself into one enormous gape. Then\nTommy Williams came up laughing, with his hat full of broken victuals;\nand the Captain, who understood the subject, said: \"Not too fast, or\nhe'll fall to pieces. And pour down a little whiskey to soften it.\"\n\nWhen the poor fellow came round a little--and flat enough he had been\nbefore--to our surprise he proved himself an exceedingly brave and\nwell-intentioned man. In fact, if he had been otherwise we should never\nhave found him there. A barbarian he appeared at first, but that was\nappearance only, and under the stress of misfortune, although he\nbelonged to a race which is the most barbarous of the Caucasus. When\nthrough our nervous interpreter we began to understand him, we soon\nperceived that it was our good luck as well as his own, which had\nbrought him to us. And much as at first we grudged the time expended in\nthis humanity, we soon came to see that it had been well spent, even for\nour own purposes. After such a fast, and then such feasting (prolonged\nin even more than due redress), it would have been most unfair to expect\nmany words from him prematurely. We clothed him a little, for he was\nstark naked,--and so hairy a person I never beheld,--and then we cut the\ntight cord knotted round his waist, from which even famine had not freed\nhim; and then we made a litter--for he could not walk--and carried him\nto our night-quarters. Luckily there was no foe in search of us, or that\nmiserable sufferer's groans and snores must have told our whereabout to\nevery echo. He surprised us again by an eager call for supper, but none\nwould we give him, until he had splashed for a quarter of an hour in the\nglacier stream. Then we fed him again, and clothed him fairly, and a\ndecent and reputable man he looked, though going down the vale of years.\nAnd his tale was interpreted as follows.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nUSI, THE SV\u00c3\u0082N\n\n\n\"I am Usi, of Ushkul, in the country of the Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns; Usi the Bear-slayer\nwas my name, as long as I lived among them. The custom of the country is\nthat as often as a female child is born, any youth of the village who\nlooks forward to his need of marriage may come to the cradle and hang\nhis own bullet around the neck of the infant, and from that time she is\npledged to him, and he must marry her when she is old enough. When I was\na stripling, the wife of our Priest produced him their fourteenth child,\na daughter; and I was the first to go in at his door, and bespeak the\nyoung creature for myself. But as fortune ordained, the damsel proved\ndeaf and dumb, though in other ways quite useful; and I very justly\nrefused in the presence of all the village to marry her. And this I did,\nwhen she was ten years old, allowing her plenty of time for others, who\nmight esteem it to their pleasure and advantage to possess a wife\nwithout a tongue. But the very next day, when I was watching the maize,\na bullet came through my hat, and lodged in a tree behind me; and when I\ndug it out, behold it was my own with the fancy pattern on it, with\nwhich I had betrothed myself ten years before. To that I need not have\npaid much attention, but that the Priest had nine well-grown sons, and\nit would be the duty of all these nine in succession to lie in wait for\nme, and endeavour to shoot me through the head. The eldest had been too\nnear the mark for me to believe without rashness that the other eight\nwould fire in vain; so I took my good mother's advice, which she gave me\nwith many tears, and left my native place for lifetime. Neither was it\nsafe for me to dwell in any of the villages for miles and miles around,\nbecause we people of the Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns had suffered from want of food for the\nlast two years, and had been obliged to take all the loaves, and corn,\nand cattle of our neighbours within three days' journey; and so we were\nout of favour with them.\n\n\"On this account I was compelled, having borne a strong hand in those\nforages, to keep myself away from spots where I would have settled\ngladly. At a distance I saw beautiful maidens, over the tops of the\nraspberries; but whenever I desired to draw near them, there was sure to\nbe a father or a brother, whose cow or whose sheep had been beef or\nmutton to me. And those people bear such things in mind, not being\ngenerous as we are. And thus I went along the valleys, feeding on the\nfruit, wherever the bears had left a tail of it. Then going further\ntowards the rising sun, which is the strength of all of us, I came upon\na man who carried a kinjal on a gun-mouth.\n\n\"In those days, I could jump as high as I could put my hands up; and\nbeing surprised by his pointing at me, I did it to give him time to\nthink. This made him think more of me than I deserved, and instead of\nshooting me, he asked in what land men could jump so. I could not\nunderstand at first, though he did it with all his fingers; because we\nhad kept ourselves apart from other people, whenever we could live\nwithout our neighbours' goods. But I was always considered the foremost\nof the young men for understanding, and I contrived to make out what he\nmeant, and to do a thing which is much harder--to make him know what I\nmeant. He was a soldier of the great Imaum, desiring to shoot Russians;\nand as soon as we made out one another, he showed me the notches on his\ngun, and I counted forty-two, and he said every one was the good corpse\nof a Russian. This made me long to do the like, though the Russians had\nnever shot at me, but my own friends had; and my soul arose to look\nalong a gun at any stranger, even as it had been done to me.\n\n\"Others came up, and when they found how straight my barrel was, and\nwhat it was famous for doing among the bears, the Captain said, 'Thou\nshalt do it, my lad, with the bears that eat our people.' And so I was\nput into Shamyl's army, and for many years enjoyed myself. I have shot\nthree Russian colonels, and small officers by the dozen; and I could\nhave shot the Commander once; but his daughter was by his side, and I\nstopped my finger when it was on the crook, with my mind upon my mother.\n\n\"Twelve years I fought under Shamyl, and did so much good that as often\nas a great man came on the Russian side, it was my place to put a stop\nto him. If you come across any of our old men now, and say to them,\n'What about Usi the Bear' you will see their eyes sparkle, and hear them\nsay, 'Not one among us could compare with him for sending a Cossack to\nthe devil three-quarters of a verst away.' Alas that I shall no more do\nit! The times are not as they used to be.\n\n\"Then there came a man who was the noblest of all the sons of men to\nlook at that ever the red sun shone upon. Imar, the son of Dadian,\nMaster of the Western Lesghians, stronger than an Auroch bull, and\ngentler than a suckling woman. His father Dadian had been mighty, and a\nlord of men; but Imar was as the Saint Christ that stands in gold among\nthe images of clay. Though I was not of his tribe, I craved to be put\ninto his troop, and whatever he did Usi was never far away. Until the\nwar came to an end, and all who were not shot or starved went home to\ntheir own mountains. But I dared not go to Ushkul yet, and had forgotten\nhow to live without a rifle in my hands. Then Imar, the son of Dadian,\ntook me, and beholding in me an honest man, and the surest with a long\ngun of all whom he had proved in battle, he appointed me a little place\non the northern slope of Kazbek, to keep the wild beasts from the crops,\nand the wolves who had thriven by means of the war from eating the\nhelpless children. As long as he reigned I had a hut in the forest, and\ntwenty-five kopeks a week, and all the timber I could cut, and a wife\nwho behaved very softly to me, and bore me several children.\n\n\"Then the Russians spread their hands along the mountains and the\nvalleys, when there was no longer any power of men in arms to stop them,\nand they put a tribute on every house, and they sent away all the\nleaders of the men who had fought against them, and among them the Lord\nImar, to a little island in the West which had never been friendly with\nthem. My money was cut down to ten kopeks; but I had my cattle and sheep\nand goats, and all the things that I could grow or shoot, until that\nPrincess Marva came, the widow of Rakhan Houseburner, and claimed the\ncommand of everything. I would not rebel against the sister of the man I\nhad loved so much, and she said that she sent him all the money to keep\nhim in his exile, and for a long time people believed her. Until a great\nman of authority was sent to us from Russia, to see to the forests and\nthe revenue, and he told us that the lady had never sent a kopek to her\nbrother, but that the Russians very justly allowed him most of his\nrevenue, because he had friends of clever voices and power in high\nplaces. Then the Princess said that I defied her, although I had never\nsaid a word of lies, and she sent fierce men to turn me out; but I had a\nlittle powder left, and my eye was straight though my hands are old, and\nI made two of them fall as dead as bears, and the rest flew away, like\nthe shadow of a cloud, when the wind is blowing.\n\n\"But a week after that my house was burned, while my wife and I were\nfast asleep; and I lost the gun that shoots so straight, though I think\nit must be in the ashes still. My little daughter, nine years old, died\nin the stream we put her in to relieve her of her death-pain, and the\nother damsel and both my boys were hurt by jumping into the fir-tree.\nThe hair of my wife's head was scorched so that I had to put a\nsheep-skin on; and the doctor said that if I had been a smooth man, I\nnever could have worn a shirt again. But people were good, and I had\nshot a bear, which was hanging on a tree unmelted; and when you have\nsuch fat to rub you, you can cure anything outside.\n\n\"Ossets, and Lesghians, and such races might think none the worse of\nMarva for treating them in that kind of way; but Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns, such as I am,\nhave never abandoned their bodies and their goods to the authority of\nany one since the time of the great Queen Tamara, none of us can tell\nhow long ago; and although I might not be a true Sv\u00c3\u00a2n now, yet the\nnature of the race abode in me. Then, while I was thinking, I heard a\nthing which stirred me like the trumpet of the great Imaum,--S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar\nhimself was coming home to take his proper place again, and do good to\nhis people. Great joy was spread among the Lesghians; but the Ossets\nwent against the thought, because he had too much strength of law, and\nhad grievously wronged them of the many goods flowing in to their\ndwellings from robbery, for the short time he governed at Karthlos. It\nwas said, moreover, that Queen Marva, as she loved to hear herself\ncalled, would now have no chance of holding fast her manifold\nencroachments, fruitful valleys which she had stolen, and flocks and\nherds, and timber-trees, and crag-sides where some strangers pay her for\nhunting stones which they can change for gold.\n\n\"Now I will tell you a little thing; and it is the wisdom of the wiser\ndays. There are two sorts of bears which prowl and devour in the\ncorn-land and the forest; the big brown bear called _Michael_, who\ndestroys the crops and the fruit-trees, but is glad to run from an\nunarmed child, unless his body is wounded; and then there is another\nbear, not so large indeed, but black with a white frill to its bosom.\nThis animal we call _Michaina_; and a wise man flies from it, unless he\ncan slay it at one shot; because it will rush upon him in the dark, and\ntear out his intestines. And our fathers have left word for us through\nmany generations, that the brown bear is the form in which bad men on\nearth have been condemned to come back to it and see the harm they did;\nwhen some of it has been stopped by death. But the black bears are the\nwicked women, still going on in wickedness, not so often met with as the\nevil men, but a hundredfold to be dreaded, being black to the depth of\ntheir hearts and souls. And this black bear Queen Marva is.\n\n\"I had no house in the forest now, and no place left me in the world\nbetter than any other; and it mattered little to my flesh what became of\nall great people. I had my wounded children, or as many as remained of\nthem, to carry on my back sometimes, or sometimes to run and pull me on,\naccording to the power of our courage. And my wife, when I grieved about\nher hair, which had brought men in office to admire her, said that\nwithout it her head felt lighter, and begged me not to accept another\nwoman, with no hut of my own to bring her to, and no meat to put into\nher. Why she asked me such a thing--when I had never thought of it, and\nwas going along in a steadfast way, with a child on either\nshoulder-blade--only the Lord, who made most of the women for our good,\ncan tell us.\n\n\"Sir, and honourable gentlemen (who have saved my life upon a hair),\nwhen I was a boy my teaching was to believe in the Devil only, and to\npray to certain images that knew the way to appease him. But now I have\nbeen among wiser people, who look up to the sky, and think that it was\nmade for good as well as evil. And whether that be true or false, I have\nfound the people who think thus a great deal better than the dark\nbelievers.\"\n\nAt this point the poor Sv\u00c3\u00a2n broke down, and shed a flood of tears after\na long sad gaze at the mountains as if he had no home now, and at the\nsky as if he had no hope there. We gave him a little more nourishment,\nfor we saw that his tale was coming towards us now; and then he wiped\nhis eyes, and set them sternly, and cast self-pity into the fire of his\nwrongs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nTHE EYE OF GOD\n\n\n\"Seven days agone I was seeking in the woods, together with my wife and\nlittle ones, with the worst of the winter past behind us, and kind roots\nshining above the snow (which had smothered all of them for months), and\npith of growth as good as corn, to be found by those who are used to it;\nfor the desire of our hearts was only to keep a spark of life in them,\nuntil we might get to places where mankind grows corn and grinds it. For\nI had heard of an ancient friend, the best man I ever knew to fight,\nwhen it came to axe or kinjal, though he never could shoot afar like me;\nand his name was Stepan, the Lesghian. For a number of years he had been\naway, following his master's fortunes; but lately he was come back, they\nsaid, bringing household goods to prepare for him.\n\n\"Then in the dark woods, as we crept along, weary and hungry and trying\nvainly to comfort one another, we beheld a company of well-fed people,\nriding in the timber-track below, which we had been afraid to occupy. By\nthe white sheep-skins upon their heads, we knew that they were Ossets,\nmen of Queen Marva's bodyguard, whom she had chosen from all the tribe;\neven as the great Imaum had riders of the Avar race continually faithful\nto him. At the head of them rode the young Prince Hisar, as wicked a\nyoung man as ever drew breath; and behind them came a score of footmen,\nrejoicing in cruelty, and haters of the Lord.\n\n\"'Go you on, my child,' I said to my wife Rhada; 'in the morning I will\nbe with you by the great red pine;' so I left my family in the hands of\nGod, and putting dust upon my head, like an old man seeking alms, I\nfell in with the rear of that sprawly-jointed troop, and none of them\nknew that it was Usi. When a man calls for alms in the name of the Lord,\nhis brethren are happy to escape expense by letting him walk with them,\nas if they heard him not. And so I went on with them till night, for I\nwanted to know what their wickedness was; and I sang them sweet verses\nwhich they could not understand, and they gave me some scraps to keep me\nquiet. Then from a boy who was pitiful to me, perceiving how much of the\nworld I had seen, when the flesh-pots hung upon the crooks and bubbled,\nI learned what the meaning of this armed troop was. They were coming\nwith a strong force by order of their Mistress, to make a hearty welcome\nto her brother and his daughter upon their return to the native land,\nfrom the place where the Russian steam-road ends at the Northern plain\nof the great mountains. All had been settled that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar and his\ndaughter should come from Vladikaukaz in a hired troika, and be received\nby their loving sister and aunt, at a place appointed; and there they\nmust leave the great Dariel road, and be conducted by her to Karthlos,\nwith great rejoicing and affection kindled. But why were all these men\nthus armed? Not as for travelling only? Why did they carry ropes and\nchains? Why was there not a Lesghian among them? and why was there no\nsign of the Princess, eager to embrace her kindred? Loving S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar as I\ndid, I resolved to go on, and understand these things.\n\n\"On the following day, the Ossets drove me from among them with many\nblows; but I cared not, since I had renewed my strength with plentiful\nwaste victuals, and a warm sound sleep. For I could watch them none the\nworse for being outside of their wicked troop, and by this time I well\nknew what they meant. So I followed them to the great Russian road,\ntowards which the forest track whereon I found them led; and there they\nencamped on either side. There were steep rocks around them, full of\nblack caves and crannies, and without much risk I crawled up into one of\nthese, so that I could see all these warriors and the road beyond them,\nwithout any risk of their seeing me.\n\n\"Before I had been there very long, a three-horse carriage came up the\nroad, followed by two carts piled with goods; and the young chief rode\nto meet them, and much salutation might be seen, and the carriage and\ncarts were unloaded and sent back again, so that only S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar--for I\nknew his gait and stature even at that distance--with a young lady, and\ntwo attendants, a man and a woman, stood in the road. Hisar no doubt had\nassured them that the Princess was close at hand with vehicles well\nprepared to conduct them home. But it seemed to me that the Prince and\nthe lady were looking to this side and to that, and gazing at every\ncorner, as if they expected some one who ought to have met them, but was\nnot to be found. And suddenly I thought that they were looking out for\nStepan, Imar's milk-brother and most faithful friend. And I wished with\nall my heart that he were there, or could even be advised of his lord's\nreturn.\n\n\"Sir, and honourable gentlemen, I will not deceive you by speaking as if\nI had seen the shameful things that happened, almost before one could\nthink of them, to the great Chief and his daughter. For they were led\nvery politely into a dark narrow valley that slopes from the road, and\ncannot be discerned at all from it. And a torrent, that rushes along the\nlower end, goes by with such an uproar that an army with drums might\nscarcely be heard at the mouth of it. They were led there perhaps on\npretence of a hospitable meal such as I would with joy pursue. But in\nsad truth it was to overthrow them by means of ropes, and loops, and\ntrees, for S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar was known to be the strongest man in all the great\narmy of Shamyl; and although he might now be unarmed and defenceless, it\nwould be easier to master him by fraud than force. And although I saw\nnot the doing of it, the old head sees more than young eyes sometimes;\naccording to an ancient tag of ours, 'The grey bush looks round the\ncorner.'\n\n\"They came not back into the wide strong road, for fear of Cossacks or\nother gapes; but went along the forest ways of rock and slough and\nwaterfall; and through my old experience in the turn of war--for Shamyl\nwas fox, wolf, and lion in one--it was easy enough for me to keep in\ntheir track, without giving them any smell of me. They had my old\ncommander strapped on poles across two horses, which must have been\ngreat pain for him, and would have torn a loose man in two; but I never\nheard him speak a groan, although they passed through hollow places,\nwhere the misery of a man sounds loud. The fair damsel had not her\nsenses with her, being of softer substance; and cruel as they were, they\nbore her gently upon a litter of slender wood, not desiring to hurt her\nyet, and having perhaps later occasion for her. Some of them jested\nabout her beauty, till the violent young man rode back, and sent their\nloose mouths sprawling on the rocks. He means to keep her for himself, I\ntrow.\n\n\"When the sun was getting low, and but for my memory of honest warfare,\nand the love of an old soldier for a kindly leader, I must have dropped\naway through weariness, the feet of their horses struck on softer\nground, and behold they were entering a fair green valley, on the\nnorthern breast of Kazbek, where the sun strikes not from on high, but\ntwinkles along the rocky passages, when the slope of the earth invites\nhim, in the morning and in the evening time, like a low flight of\narrows, such as I have seen when the Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns were mighty bowmen. Wherefore\nthis valley is never parched up, as they are on the south of the\nmountains, but is covered with moss, like the breath of night, and soft\nwith trickling moisture. And the learned men say that an ancient race,\nwho had come through the gates of Caucasus, having conquered the whole\nworld all around, set up their last pillars here, and desired to go no\nfurther. And the masonry of giants is there to prove it, such as no man\ncan make when the world grows old.\n\n\"Here that troop of brigands--for such a name is almost too good for\nthem--opened a narrow door in the cliff, which cannot be seen from every\nplace, because dark rocks encompass it. What they did there I cannot\ntell, for I durst not set foot down the valley, and there was no getting\nnear it in time from above, so as to look down over them. I could only\ndiscover that some went in, stepping as if with burdens, while others\nwere left on guard outside. By and by, I heard a clanking like the swing\nof an iron door, and presently all, or as I thought all, the riders came\nback, and with laughter and singing, and the young chief Hisar at their\nhead, made off by the track which leads home to their village.\n\n\"Then I did a very foolish thing, which has all but cost me my life,\nwithout being of any use to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar. If I had counted the men on\nhorseback, which I might have contrived perhaps to do, though it would\nnot have been very easy, I should have learned that they were not all\ngone, but that two were left on guard. Descrying no horses tethered in\nthe valley, and knowing that the prisoners could not escape, I concluded\nrashly that all the Ossets were gone, at least for the present, and that\nI might safely spy all around, and perhaps even try to let S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar know\nthat I would do my best to save him. So I hastened with some care, but\nstill too boldly, along the foot of the cliff which rims the valley, so\nas to endeavour to approach the door. For the shadows were wiping out\nthe shapes and colours of a man, or a bush, or a rock standing still;\nwhile the soft moss and herbage took away the fear of sound.\n\n\"Looking out winkingly in all directions, like a man of the chase who\nhas espied the T\u00c3\u00bbr, at the end of the valley in the clouding of the\ndusk, I beheld a company of little rocks, jutting from the soft land,\nand standing in jags, like an old man's teeth, across the butt-end,\nwhere the dungeon began. In and out of these I crept, going very\nstealthily, as if I were dealing with a Cossack outpost; but the\nmischief of it was that I had no gun, only the dagger that everybody\nhas; and this one was more like lead than steel, having come to me cheap\nin my distress from some city in the west called _Brummerum_. By\nbreathing upon it many times, I was doubtful of its temper, but never\nthought how much it would betray me.\n\n\"Among those jags of rock I stood, watching the face of the cliff\nbeyond, and the deep withdrawal of the iron door set in the granite\nmasonry of some nation as old as Noah. And I said to myself that with a\ngood ash-trunk, and Stepan, and myself, and a score of strong men to\ncharge at it like a battering-ram, stout as it was it would perhaps give\nin. There were loop-holes also on either side, to give air and a little\nlight sometimes, and I ventured a low breath of whistle in a soft and\nfriendly tone, to ask whether anybody might look forth, though there was\nno width for a fox to squeeze through. But the whole of my wisdom only\nproved what a fool an old soldier is sometimes.\n\n\"For a loop was thrown over my head from behind, and then two strong\nmen had hold of me. I managed to twist with one arm free, and struck\nwith my dagger at one of them. But instead of making any hole in him, it\ncame back on my wrist like an osier, having met with his metal\ncartridge-belt; and then they pulled me off my feet, and I lay like a\nsheep with his legs tied. I thought they would have cut my throat\noutright, for my head fell back the right way of it, and one of them\nwhipped out his knife to do it; but the other cried out about the holy\nseason, and then put his arm across. So they satisfied themselves with\nbinding me with cords that cut into my flesh; and they carried me\nthrough the night, shaken up with pain; and I knew not where I was, till\nI came back to myself through necessity of lying to Queen Marva.\n\n\"But as my evil fortune fell, there happened to be among the Ossets,\nanother old soldier of Shamyl, and one who had never served under S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar. This man knew me, and told the Queen who I was; and but for the\nholy time she would have crucified me then and there. 'Religion forbids\nus to slay the wretch,' said Marva, with a glance of blackness, 'but\ndoth not forbid to make wolf's meat of him.'\n\n\"Three days ago I was fastened to a rock with the big rope round my\nbody, and my wrists and ankles corded, so that if any wolves came by\nthey should have no trouble with me. But the Lord commanded only one\nwolf to come, and he was overtaken with great wonder at the sight; and I\nhad the courage to keep silence, and gaze at him, as if demanding what\nhe meant by being there. Seeing me naked and so hairy, he could not\nunderstand such an animal; for I could no longer stand upright. Then, as\nI never flinched nor moved, he sheathed his teeth, and turned his eyes,\nand his tail began to quiver. I kept my eyes fixed on him steadily, and\nmy face as firm as the crag behind; until with a little whine of doubt\nhe drew in his nostrils, and dropped his tail, and trotted off to\nconsult his friends, and perhaps he has taken his family to look for me\nthis evening. A monstrous wolf he was in truth, and as hungry perhaps as\nI could be.\n\n\"For two days I had been numbed, and parched, and struck by the sun and\nthe moon so much, that instead of any brave time of thought, I had only\nleaped and raved and yelled, and dashed myself about in vain, tearing my\nskin in strips, and cutting gashes into my purple flesh, and making\nholes all over me.\n\n\"But the moment that wolf was out of sight, I was seized with a cold and\nshivering dread, so that I could see the naked hairs of all my body\nquivering. Death I knew that I must have; and death had seemed a\nreasonable thing, when I gave it to another man who was trying to do the\nsame to me. But to see myself being crunched alive, to feel those yellow\nfangs pulling my strings out, and that long tongue lapping up my\nblood--let me die before he came again. Surely I must have strength\nenough left to burst the veins of my neck and die. Were there any rocks\nwithin my reach so rugged and sharp that I might fling one of my leading\nblood-pipes down, again and again, till it should burst? I flung out my\nlegs, and strained my length, like a chained dog clawing for a bone out\nof reach, in search of some blade of flint keen enough to saw my gullet\nor windpipe through.\n\n\"But what did I descry wedged firmly in a little cleft among them? A\nlong brown eye, which I could see into, curdled with coils of different\ncolours, as regular as a bulb cross-cut, centred with vaporous waves,\nand hooped with rings of white, as the rind encloses some dark wood.\nThen a spring of hope like the sparkle of a star flashed into the\nclouding of my mind, for this is the stone[1] which we call the 'Eye of\nGod.' It is stronger and keener of edge than any flint, luckier to man\nthan mother's milk, and harder than steel of the Genoese.\n\n\"Instead of straining, twisting, and wriggling, to release my corded\nwrists, which were lashed to the rope at my waist so tight that I could\nnot fetch teeth nigh them, I began to saw the cord below the clench of\nmy thumbs upon the stone of God. The agony of it was terrible; but at\nlast I rent my hands apart, and as soon as the blood returned to them,\nwith teeth and flint I contrived to sever the rope that strung me to\nthe rock, and to hobble to a brook to drink. The rest you know; three\ndays have I borne of agony, starvation, and the stars and sun. The Lord\nGod--if there be One in heaven to look down upon His own wicked\nworks--spit my blood into that woman's throat!\"\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[1] Probably the Agate.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nTWO OLD FRIENDS\n\n\nThe Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns are a strange and peculiar race, declared indeed by the few\noutsiders who have ever seen them and come back, to be the most original\nof mankind. And Usi proved at least that much, by showing some rudiments\nof gratitude.\n\nAlthough he had managed to tell his tale, with failure of words, and\ngasps for breath, and rolling of his eyes when the agony came back, poor\nWolfsmeat was not fit for much, except to be laid in a soft and shady\nplace, consoled with tobacco and cordials, and continually asked how he\nfelt now. We soon understood what he wished to say, even without the\ninterpreter, for he had picked up small pieces of divers tongues, by\nbeing so long among the mountain troops. More than once we feared that\nhe would never bear up from the pains and privations he had undergone;\nbut he said that he should be unworthy of the name of a Shamylid, or son\nof Shamyl, unless he could starve for a week, without showing immoderate\nsigns of hunger. If the signs Usi had manifested, after only three days,\nwere moderate, no wonder that the big wolf turned and fled from a\ncountenance so expressive.\n\nStrogue, and Cator, and myself, who might now be called the three\nleaders, sat late into that night, discussing the story of this patient\nsufferer. What chance had we of being in time, even if we could raise\nforce enough to prevent the murder in cold blood appointed for next\nMonday? All the fighting men of this tribe of Ossets in the Upper Terek,\nand the Ardon valleys, would probably be mustered there to carry out the\nexecution. Cator had often heard of the place so clearly described by\nthe injured Sv\u00c3\u00a2n, and he told us that these wild folk called it the\n\"Valley of Retribution.\" From Usi's account, it was plain that Marva was\nmaking a tribal revenge of it. Her brother would be tried and condemned\nby the tribe, in expiation of the death of their former chief, Prince\nRakhan. Him she had hated and scorned perhaps; for she was not of the\nsweet kind of women, who look at their wrongs with dewy eyes; but\naccording to the Osset creed her duty was--blood for blood, and soul for\nsoul. Strong in her own dominion now, she might drop all that, if she\nsaw fit, and cry, \"Bygones be bygones.\" Every man of the tribe (being in\nhis heart most loyally afraid of her) would have joined all his cousins\nin lamenting, that the days were not as they had been; that nobody had\nthe courage now to keep up good old customs; and yet, however right\none's own mind was, what could one do, but as the others did? And then\nto sigh, and cast a glance at Heaven (that forbears to fall upon us) and\nlight another pipe with some remorse, but plenty of sentiment to make it\ndraw.\n\nThis was not for us to do, in a state of things beyond all understanding\nof any man not in the thick of them; and a thousandfold worse for him,\nif he is there. Nothing is more pleasing than to hear a man tell the\nstory of some touch-and-go adventure he has been through. If he is an\nEnglishman, he is sure to be self-ashamed about it, and describe himself\nas much more frightened than his slow system gave him time to be. But\nwhoever he is, you may depend upon it that he will put into the\nnarrative a lot of things which never occurred--till afterwards. And I\nam afraid that I shall do this, when I try to tell how we went on,\nthough I mean to tell everything word for word, which ought to be the\nsame as fact for fact.\n\nBut lo, at the very outstart, indignation cripples one! We know that it\nis sure to go too far, and to put things into darker colours than clear\ntruth has cast into them. In dread of this, a truthful man draws back,\nand takes too weak a brush.\n\nAll of us were put upon that sense of wrong which stirs us up to think\nless of our own poor lives, and more of that great power which the Lord\nhas planted in us (though He has not always worked it out), to show that\nwe are something more than the brute creation round us. The sense of\njustice, and good will, and love to those of our own kind, and hate of\nall that wrong them. Even if S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had not been the man he was, and\nDariel's father, I would gladly have risked my life--if time were\nallowed me to know what I was about--rather than let such inhumanity\ntriumph among human beings. Strogue and Cator were of the same mind, and\nthe rest of the miners found that a little excitement would not be\namiss. The worst of it was that they were inclined to underrate the\nenemy. To them it seemed sound argument that a dozen Englishmen could\nlarrup, almost with their neckties, thirty or forty of such fellows as\nthey were like to meet with. Even if there had been truth in that, and\nit would be most ungrateful on my part to disparage them, what would\nthey do if they had to encounter perhaps a hundred men all well armed?\nTherefore we must increase our force, and that without loss of a minute.\nTo call for Russian interference would be vain, for they had no\nbrigade--even if they would have used it--that could be brought up in\nthree days' time. We must act for ourselves; as the rule is laid down\ngenerally for poor Englishmen, because they are so few, yet always\ncalled upon to meet so many.\n\nStrogue struck the proper note. Of savage people I knew nothing, save of\nIncome-tax Commissioners, who charged us twice upon our land,--once for\nour crime in owning it, and once for the profit which they alone were\nable to make out of it. But the Captain said: \"These men will fight. And\nthey fight quite as bravely as we do, only with more passion in it. To\nbeat them, we must have man for man, or something very near it. The only\nplan is to find your friend Stepan, and all the fellows he can bring.\nThat poor beggar who is groaning in his sleep seems to know where to\nfind him. He will not be able to walk for days; but he can tell us where\nto go.\"\n\nWe had searched in vain, as I may have said, for any sign of Stepan near\nKarthlos. That was one of the things which made us sure that treachery\nwas at work; for if he had travelled with the heavy goods, straightway\nhome, as his orders were, he ought to have been at Karthlos long ago, in\nspite of the terrible winter. But no one seemed to know where to find\nhim, although a rumour was spread abroad that his master was returning.\nThere was, however, every prospect now of discovering him and those\nother retainers who had been with the Chief in his exile, for Usi could\nnot have been so long the forester or huntsman of that district without\nknowing where to find all the principal members of his adopted tribe.\nWhat could be finer justice than that a fiendish plot of fratricide\nshould be discomfited chiefly through the brutality of its conceiver? If\nthat tortured victim could but recover the use of his swollen limbs, we\nmight push along towards the Lesghian valleys in time to rouse the tribe\non the Saturday night. But to carry poor Usi was a sad, slow drag, and\nto go without him would be useless, even if humanity allowed it.\n\n\"Bear's grease!\" was his perpetual moan; \"Oh, that men valued the\nprecious bear's grease! If the good Lord would send me only half a pound\nof bear's grease, I would leap like the Ibex, and dance like the T\u00c3\u00bbr.\"\n\nThen, as if to show that Heaven itself had taken a turn in our favour, a\nmost unusual thing came to pass, although at the time I was very far\nfrom being at all surprised at it. But those who knew the country said\nthat such a thing scarcely ever happened, and all of our little company\nmight live to be ninety, and keep eyes like twenty, without ever seeing\nsuch a thing again. However, I can answer for it, and was not at all\ndisturbed by it.\n\nWe came, walking heavily yet tenderly, and like men who (if they were in\nEngland) would go to their chemist and ask him whether he had tried his\n\"Celandine\" on his own feet,--we came about the middle of that\nday--Friday it was and a critical time--to a corner where two torrents\nran into one another's arms, with as much noise as two Frenchmen make.\nThere were no trees, not a leaf to break the sun; everything was either\nhard or wet; and the light itself seemed to come in gurgles, as if it\nwere almost giddy with the shining of the water, and the staring of the\nrocks. In the loose spread of it, below the rush of the two streams into\none another,--both being buxom with snow on the melt, which affords them\na thickness of suet,--there I saw a great sprawling thing--sprawling at\nleast it appeared to be, and at the same time splashing. I happened to\nbe foremost of the file, yet for the life of me, I could not make out\nwhat it was; till Cator spoke over my shoulder thus--\n\n\"Motherly she-bear, carrying her cub! Economical father wants to kill\nit--they always do at this time of year--mother takes a different view.\nShe will land in a second. Aim behind the shoulder. The kid is fine\neating. If you feel like missing, let me do it for you.\"\n\n\"Get away!\" I answered; \"I came first--what have you got to do with it?\"\nI put up my rifle, but when she landed with wonderful care not to hurt a\nhair of the baby in her clumsy mouth, and then looked at it so\nproudly--though it was but an ugly little lump--and began to lick the\nholy trickle from its newly opened eyes, such a touch of nature went\ninto my heart, that I would rather have shot myself almost. \"Fire, you\nstupid!\" keen Cator cried. And fire I did, but not at her. For\npaterfamilias came down raging, with his coat thrown back on his body,\nand his little eyes rolling, and his hairy chin poked out in fury at his\nwife's self-assertion. My bullet behind his open shoulder told him that\nthere might be two opinions about paternal duty, and he rolled like a\nlog into the swirling torrent, and was washed up on our side a hundred\nyards below. Then Usi, the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n, in a glory of excitement rose from his\nlitter, and told us what to do; and we cut him out the fat that lies\nalong the kidney part, and he scrabbled it into his stringy legs, and\nfell back again, and smiled at them. In less than half an hour he could\nwalk, and we had all we could do to keep up with him.\n\nThat night we slept in Kazbek village, which is on the great Russian\nroad; and we laid our plans for the morrow. Cator was to make rush for\nthe mine, which he could reach before nightfall, and implore Jack\nNickols to spare us every son of a gun who could handle a rifle; while\nStrogue, and Usi, and myself, and others, made every hour of daylight\ntell for our race in quest of Stepan. We feared that those vile Ossets\nhad a short cut across the western mountain, from their village to the\n\"Valley of Retribution,\" which would bring them in front of any speed of\nours; and unhappily so it proved indeed. And they must have carried Usi\nby that track, when they caught him spying in their valley; although\nthey gave him small chance of knowing what was time, or where was road.\nFor the mighty mass of Kazbek lay betwixt the Osset villages, and the\nvale which had been for ages hallowed to their horrible revenge.\n\nAt daybreak on Saturday we set forth, in the midst of a miserable\ndrizzle, which would have made the way as hard to find as it was bad\nwhen found, except for the knowledge of the land which Usi showed. That\nson of Shamyl, as he loved to be called, was of infinite service to our\ncause. Very seldom did he care to speak, unless he was consulted; and\nthe bronze cast of his rugged face beneath that hairy thicket showed no\nmore life than the juniper scrub which we saw on the cheeks of the\nmountain. But the quick blue flash of his eyes, whenever we caught them\nunexpectedly, was like the point blank spark that comes, when the\nlightning is over one's own lawn. Let me not be in that man's\nblack-books--was the first thought of even the boldest mind, as Strogue\nsaid more than once to me.\n\nPresently this \"Bear-slayer\" showed us that he deserved the name of\n\"Straight-pipe,\" which he had received from Shamyl. For while we were\nhalting in a glen to feed, Gator's rifle stood against a rock. We\ngrudged every moment, and were eating against time, when one of those\ngreat black eagles, which are the grandest of European birds, came\nsoaring above us at a mighty height, searching the earth for lamb, or\nkid, or perhaps a nice babe fast asleep beneath a rock. With Cator's\nleave, Usi raised his gun, and he must have been as quick as light, for\nthe crack of the rifle and the heavy flop of the dead bird on the track\nbefore us, were the first I knew of the matter, although I was standing\nwithin a few yards of him. \"That's a grand shot; I couldn't have done\nthat, although I am not a bad hand,\" said Strogue. But the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n was not\nsatisfied with his work. \"I struck him too far behind,\" he said, \"my own\npipe would have done it better. I must get time to search for it among\nthe ashes.\" But we could not spare him yet; for he alone could show us\nthe men we wanted.\n\nHow it may be in the winter I know not, and perhaps no one would care to\nknow much about it then, but to me, who was used to very reasonable\nweather (sometimes dull and sometimes fickle, but scarcely ever furious,\nand generally comprehensible), the style of this Caucasian sun, whether\nas he asked his way among a crowd of pinnacles, or whether as he mounted\nhigh, strong, and hot above them, or even when he meant to be\ncompassionate and genial in looking back at his long day's work--all I\ncan say is, that to a man of Surrey, who lives out of doors nearly all\nday long, and can tell you the time within half an hour, whether it be\ncloudy or whether it be clear, the climate was incongruous. At home, you\ncould look up at the sky, and after making wise allowances for the way\nof the wind, and the manner of the clouds, and the inclination of the\nquicksilver, you could generally say something, which could be explained\naway when a little incorrect. But here the only wisdom was to shake your\nhead, and say the developments are complicated, pressure variable and\nconflicting, local showers not improbable, thunder not impossible. As\nour Scientific Staff begins to waver, after predicting rain every day,\nin a drought of three months' duration.\n\nThat Saturday evening the sun went down (so far as we could get a\nstraight look at him through such ins and outs), genial, bountiful, a\ngreat globe of good will, squandering gold upon a maiden world of snow,\nwhich it blushed to accept, and yet spread upon its breast.\n\n\"The weather at any rate is on our side,\" was my cheerful remark to\nCaptain Strogue; \"if we can only find those fellows, we shall be all\nright.\"\n\n\"Don't you be too sure,\" he said, \"there may be a hurricane to-morrow.\"\n\nTravelling eastward all that day, we had passed the foot of Karthlos\nlong ago, under Usi's guidance; for to climb the steep would be waste of\ntime, as there was no strength of men there now. Then we descended into\nanother valley, and Usi blew upon a horn, and listened. We heard no\nreply, but he heard something, and led us, as the yellow light turned\ngrey, into a hollow place with huts around it, and out rushed two\nenormous dogs, and behold they were _Kuban_ and _Orla_!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nTHE ROOT OF EVIL\n\n\nThe amazement of those dogs at sight of me was beyond anything I ever\ndid behold. They had seen so much of the world by this time, including a\ngood deal of England, that they had learned to doubt all the evidence\nwhich untravelled dogs wag tail to. They pulled up suddenly, and looked\nat one another, with the tawny curls of their ears in a tremble, and the\nhackles of their necks thrown back, and every hair to the tips of their\ntails quivering with incredulity. Then, like a fool, I pronounced their\nnames, and the word that brings down the avalanche would have been a\nwiser utterance. They flung their great frames and golden crests in one\nshock of delight upon my breast, like a harvest-cart dashed against the\nrickyard post. Luckily I expected it, but even so was glad to be backed\nup by a rock, and there it was impossible for me to speak, all human\nemotion being swallowed up in dog.\n\nHowever, they soon made amends for that, and the roar that rang from\ncrag to crag brought every living being out. Foremost of these was our\nold friend Stepan, carrying a mighty gun, with Allai peeping through the\nloop of his elbow, and four or five more, who had been in our valley,\nstaring at us over the packing-cases. I shouted to them with the old\nsalute which they had taught me at St. Winifred's, and they made their\nsalaams, and sang their welcome, while Stepan enfolded me in his\ncapacious arms, and Allai hugged my knees and wept.\n\n\"Say nothing till we are inside,\" I whispered to Strogue, who could\nspeak their language somehow. It was high time to be prudent now, as\nwell as prompt and resolute, for it seemed as if the enemy had in every\nway outmanoeuvred us; and now, if our project should become known, the\ncase would indeed be hopeless. \"Not a word to any of these people, until\nStepan thinks fit to tell them.\"\n\nBut I need not have been so particular, for they are as true as steel to\none another, and above all to their Chieftain. Stepan told them, even\nbefore he heard my story out; because swift runners must be sent that\nvery night to other Kheusur villages, for every fighting man within\nreach to join the muster at the foot of Karthlos. And that muster, to be\nof any use, must not be later than noon of the morrow, which would be\nSunday.\n\nThen I told Stepan our side of the story, with Strogue to make it clear\nto him; and Usi, without whom we could have done nothing, recounted all\nthat he had seen, but scarcely spoke of his own woes.\n\nAt this I wondered for the moment, but knew the reason afterwards.\nStepan listened with arms folded, and his great grey head as still as a\nrock, while his eyes were harder and less expressive--as it chanced to\noccur to me--than the agate which had saved Usi's life. And I noticed\nthat the wall on which he fixed them was not half so sound and solid,\nnor the room itself so neat and cheerful as the old stone ruin occupied\nby S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's men in England. \"Is that all?\" he inquired at last; and\nStrogue replied, \"Yes; and to me it seems enough.\" The Lesghian dipped\nhis unshorn chin upon the wooded cataract of his breast, and nodded\ncourteously, meaning clearly--\"Sir, you have been through us, but not to\nany purpose among us.\" And I, as a young slip--in comparison with him,\nthough old enough now to stand up for my growth--marvelled about dry\nroots, and trunks that are all bark, and so on.\n\n\"Hearken to me, and I will use few words,\" said the loyal Lesghian\nslowly, with Strogue explaining for my benefit; \"I am getting old, and I\nhave my daughters, for the Lord has granted me no son, and the babes\nwhom my daughters have brought forth while I was far away, to dwell\nupon. I am growing old, and my strength is only in the standing combat\nnow. I cannot leap down from a rock and alight with both feet together,\nand my arms like willows of steel twined round the enemy. It has been\nordained that a man, as his years increase upon him, should increase\nalso in bulk and weight, if permitted by fortune to feed well. All the\nmen of our tribe feed well, because they are just and remain with their\nwives, who know how to cook the cattle of their neighbours. None of\nthose would we ever take, if we could trust them to leave us ours. For\nnot only are we righteous, but we endeavour to make strangers so, when\ntheir wickedness is not good for us.\n\n\"For my part I have been in foreign places, and learned much of foreign\nlanguage, sometimes increasing in wisdom thus. But as yet I have not\nfound a country fit to be placed by the side of ours, not only for the\nfairness of the land, but the goodness of the inhabitants. But, as a man\nof truth, I will admit that it is not so with our neighbours. They on\nthe other hand are breakers of the laws of righteousness, seeking only\nthe ways of evil, eager to slay all who set them example not convenient.\nAnd now they are in dread of the return of our great Chief, because he\nbrings justice and virtue with him. Their desire is to slay him, and to\nrob him of his goods, and to rule over us who belong to him.\n\n\"Me, who am his brother by the mother's breast, and bound to give my\nlife for his and all that I possess, they have deceived and cheated by\nmany lying tricks, and beguiled me, as the mother fox tempts away the\ndog to discourses of soft affection, while her children prey upon the\ntender lambs.\n\n\"Behold, when I landed from the great smoke-ship, after many weeks of\nrolling on strange waters, there came a man to meet me with a letter in\na stick, which he said was by order of the Prince himself, and I and all\nmy company must obey it. What the tongue says the ear can swallow, and\nrender to the mind for consideration. But that which the hand has\nshaped, in many forms of crookedness, cannot come into the mind through\nthe passes of the eyes without long teaching, and toiling through a\nforest full of twists and turns, which can only be endured in childhood.\nTherefore I went to a learned man, and paid him ten kopeks, and he made\nit to me the same as if S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's voice pronounced it. And thereby I\nwas commanded to stay where I was, with all my companions, and all the\ngoods, for the passes were already blocked with snow, until I should\nreceive another letter, as soon as the spring flung back the gates\nbetween the frozen mountains. The winter was very long, but at last\nanother paper came to us, through Officers of the Government, as the\nletters are sent in England. And I paid another ten kopeks, so expensive\nis such learning, and was commanded to come on by way of Kutais and hire\nwaggons, and get to this village, which is not my own; but not to go\nnear Karthlos yet, because it was full of workmen. Money was also sent\nto me in a note for a hundred roubles, and I was ordered to shoot both\nthese dogs, if I had kept them still alive.\n\n\"I was sure S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had not said that, because his daughter loved them\nso; and that made me wonder and begin to doubt, and I said to myself,\nthey shall see their master, and plead for their own lives with him.\nAlso I was ordered to remain here, almost as if I were to be in prison,\nkeeping away from my own village, and all my old friends, and obtaining\nfood only from the people close at hand, until I should be sent for. And\nthe reason was that if the Russians heard of all the goods we had, they\nwould send an officer to take toll, or seize them altogether. This I\nthought might be true enough, until the people here declared that the\nRussians never do anything like that; and again this made me doubtful.\n\n\"We, who are of the true and never to be called in question faith of\nChrist, even as the English are, do not observe these heathen fasts, and\nfeasts, and rites of superstition, but keep our own most holy seasons as\nordained by the Lord himself. Yet so noble are our minds, that we blame\nnot those of smaller knowledge, but rather abstain from meddling with\nthem during the days which they keep holy, although they be not the\nright ones. For this reason I remained here yet, resolving to set forth\non Monday, when their profane days will have returned, and to ask among\nthem the meaning of these things, which I am ordered not to seek among\nour own tribe.\n\n\"But woe is me to have learned it thus, with haste and peril and\nhelplessness! It must be the wicked Prince who has plotted this vile\nplan, having taken it straight from the fiery lips of the Evil One. It\nis not by any one to be believed that the sister of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, born at\none birth with him, should be as a cauldron of the pitch of hell, while\nhe is in an alabaster box of manna for the food of the faithful in the\nwilderness. By many generations it has been said that a woman who has\nnot been made of milk and honey must have been fashioned out of gall and\nvenom; and true it may be, yet how should such things descend from the\nmother of Imar?\n\n\"Tell me, then, for now we speak, as I would that we had spoken long\nago, in words that pass into the minds of one another, tell me what\nadvantage can the Princess Marva look for, from doing that which none of\nthe women of our tribe would wish to do, or even if she wished it under\nthe influence of the Devil, would dare to keep in her mind as long as a\nbaking-shovel in her hand.\"\n\nAs yet we had not dwelt much on this. The design being manifest, as we\nbelieved, the motive did not concern us much; and in all the hardships,\nperpetual effort, and weariness of travelling--such travel at least as\nwe had to face--the body was always too hard at work for the mind to be\nvery active, except in attending to it. Strogue looked at me, and I at\nhim, and each left the other to answer.\n\n\"Friend Stepan knows all the ins and outs of these tribal politics and\nfamily arrangements,\" the Captain opened his mouth at last, \"ever so\nmuch better of course than I do. No doubt her ladyship expects to suck\nsome benefit out of this murder,--for I don't see what else you can call\nit, although there may be a mock trial; but even without that, I always\nunderstood that the duty of the blood feud would compel her, even if she\nloved him the best on earth, to hunt him to death with alacrity. You\nknow that, although the law is not in your tribe, or at any rate you are\nfree from it, by marriage she is an Osset, and with them it is most\nsacred.\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten that,\" our host replied, looking doubtful as\nbecame him when even near the verge of argument; \"but even if that tribe\nkept up its wrath at the death of its chief so many years, the lady, as\nI have heard even in England, can do as she pleases among them now. It\nis not right, it is not just, it is not as the Lord intended. The woman\nshould never rule the man; but she will do it gladly, if they lift her\nupon the stool, instead of keeping her to the oven. But when she gets\ntired of salutes, and praises, and humble words, which ought to be like\nripe figs to her, what she begins to yearn after is money; and life will\nbe short for those who have it, when she thinks it should be hers.\"\n\n\"My good friend, my great friend Stepan,\" cried Strogue, with the stem\nof his pipe in the air, as if he never cared whether he sucked it again;\n\"you have hit the mark better about those blessed females, than I should\nhave ever dared to try to do. At the _London Rock_ it is just the\nsame--Landlady, or Barmaid, makes no difference, or the little girl that\nwipes the glasses. All eager to go for a celebrated man; but won't put a\ntear in the corner of their eyes, till they've peeped into his pockets\non the hook inside the door. That is why none of them can catch me. A\nman who has been round the world three times finds the black women\ntruest to their colour.\"\n\nTo me this was such hateful doctrine, so low, so coarse, so cannibal,\nthat I jumped up with a strong desire to send the Captain down among the\npacking-cases. But he gave me a sly wink, meaning clearly--\"The object\nof this is to fetch that fellow out.\"\n\nAnd Stepan came out, with a dignity scarcely to be expected from him.\nSome of his words were beyond my knowledge; but upon the whole he spoke\nlike this--\n\n\"I have not been round the world three times; and that man is the wisest\ntraveller who goes through his own self the most. But in all the\ncountries that I have seen, the women are better than the men, according\nto the gifts of nature. Of money they are not half so greedy, and they\nhave more compassion. Usi, the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n, will tell you what the father does\nto the female babies, when he has too many of them, in the country of\nmen and women. Straight-pipe, what does the father do then in the noble\ncountry of the Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns?\"\n\n\"He places the little one on her back,\" the Bear-slayer told us, looking\nat the floor, as if he were watching the domestic process; \"and he makes\nthe fire burn brightly. Then when the little one opens her mouth for the\nnourishment of nature, he takes the spoon from his bowl of soup, and\nfills it with red-hot embers, and pours them into the infant's mouth,\nand lo that child calls for no more food!\"\n\n\"Hast thou ever beholden a mother who would feed her infant thus?\"\nStepan asked the Captain, who looked as if his pipe had grown too hot\nfor him; and the Captain knocked out his ash, and said, \"Give me some\ncold whiskey.\"\n\n\"Lo, the moon is shining on the white peaks now, and the light will soon\nflow along the valleys. It is time for me to go,\" said Stepan, \"and\nAllai will come with me. I have told the head-man what to do; but the\nmen here are as nothing. Gentlemen, you are weary. The Lord give you\ngood rest to-night, for to-morrow we must travel fast. I will bring\nevery faithful son of the tribe, and meet you by noon at Karthlos.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nSTILL IN THE DARK\n\n\nAt midnight we stood by the door of the hut, and watched the broad bulk\nof Stepan, and the slender slip of Allai, sliding away into white breath\namong the black jaws of the mountains.\n\nI thought that I had never seen so fair a night, so lovely, soft, and\nkindly, offering guidance of bright stars among the pale blandishments\nof the moon, opening avenues of lofty hope, compassionate to mortals.\nWith such glory full in view, and the grandeur of unknown realms beyond,\nhow could any of those, who have so short a time to dwell below, spend\nit, or spare a moment of it, in the trivial worm-casts of rank and\nmoney, which cannot even slime the scythe of death?\n\nIf Farmer Ticknor had been with us--that Ticknor, I mean, who had proved\nhimself so trenchant a Micaiah to the Official Zedekiah--perhaps we\nmight not have entered into this rapturous view of the heavens. Or\nperhaps it was that we required a lesson. But whatever the explanation\nis, the fact came far in front of it. When we tried to get up in the\nmorning, there was nothing to get up by except time, who sheds no light,\nbut spends the better part of himself in quenching it. Laden as we were\nwith sleep, whose freight we had not yet discharged, we said to one\nanother that a special relief was granted us. It was manifest that human\nskill in the record of time had been overruled; the Powers that govern\nday and night could not be set at nought by watchmakers. We blew out the\nmatches we had struck, and rolled on our backs for another snooze,\nsubmissive to the will of Heaven.\n\nHow far we might have prolonged our snores, we never grew wide enough\nawake to say. But the soft folds of darkness fell around us still, and\nwe closed our eyes beneath them, as a child submits to the kisses of his\nmother. Then a mighty bellow, and a cackle, and a stamping, and a\nshovelful of cold slush thrown into our faces made all of us jump up,\nand stare about, and splutter, and every one swear, except, as I\nheartily hope, myself.\n\nIt was the old village Starchina, or Starost, or whatever his dignity\nmay have been, in a state of mind so furious that it was true bliss to\nbe no linguist. Strogue made out some of his compound curses, but was\ntoo wise to interpret them, or even to accept his own version; until\nthat most venerable and profane of men saw little advantage in cursing\nhimself. He flung down the shutter that served as a window, and poured\nabout a sackful of snow down our necks.\n\nThis might be the manner of the country; but we resented it all the more\nfor that, and spoke harshly of the place, and of all born near it, until\nStrogue sat up on his very hard board, and stared, with his eyes as\nclose as burning glasses, at the old silver watch, \"which a man could\nwork a ship by,\" and exclaimed--\"By Jove, he is done for now, George! We\nought to have been at Karthlos by this time. However he is safe to go to\nHeaven, according to your account of him.\"\n\nEven cowardice is sometimes less contemptible than flippancy. But I made\nno answer. My rage with myself was too deep to fly off into sparks\nagainst others. What could it matter to Strogue, or Starost, or even to\nStepan himself, compared with me, with me, the snorer? If the noble man\nwho had treated me as his equal--clumsy clodhopper as I was--and his\ndaughter (the model of all love and grace) were butchered by savages\nto-morrow, upon whose head would their blood lie?\n\nUpon mine--for my accursed laziness, self-indulgence, wicked gladness to\nbelieve the thing that I desired.\n\nThen I went out, and looked for the sky which had been so blue, and the\nearth which had been so green, wherever it was not brown rockiness.\nBehold--there was nothing to behold--as Usi the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n might have said of\nit--but grey thickness, fleecy softness, multitudinous whirl above, and\nvast whiteness, promiscuous glare, and slur of dazzle around us and\nbelow. Not what the puzzled world is wont to call a _blizzard_, and fly\nshuddering--for that only comes with a bitter blast, and is a mass of\npointed particles--but a genuine downright heavy snowfall (such as we\nget in March sometimes, when we are sowing the pea-drill), big flakes,\nthick flakes, like a shower of daisies, flinging their tufts in feathery\npiles, and smothering one another. \"It can't go on very long like this,\"\nsays a man who has lost in half-a-minute the pattern of his coat and\ntrousers.\n\nCertainly it could not in Surrey or in Kent; but here in the Caucasus it\nproved that it could go on, long enough at any rate to bury all the\ntrackways, and turn jagged rocks into treacherous white rollers. If we\nbegan (in our credulous greed for rest) with failing to know the time of\nday, we went on with losing the way; and what was worse, if possible, we\nlost the better part of our strength, through sprains, and strains, and\nstumbles in the drift. Mishaps of the like sort had befallen the party\nrecruited by Stepan, although they had not overslept themselves as we\ndid; and instead of prompt muster to start together at noon from the\nfoot of Karthlos, we found that it was almost four o'clock before every\none was ready.\n\n\"To do any good, we must travel all night,\" said Stepan, as he swung his\nheavy pack upon his rifle. \"To travel all night on a turnpike road is\nall very well,\" Strogue answered; \"but who could do it here, my friend?\nAnd sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If the snow stops us,\nit will stop the other fellows.\"\n\nI had indulged in this hope too; but the Lesghian's words were against\nit. \"No man can say, till his eyes give proof. But the storm came from\nthe east, and they seldom travel far in the summer-time. Like enough\nthere was not a flake on the western side of the Russian road. Ha!\nKobaduk, art thou coming too? Thy old limbs will tire, we shall have to\nleave thee, even though thou hast that colt.\"\n\nWe had not climbed the steep to the tower, because time was so short,\nand the old steward could not be of any service to us. Therefore it was\na great surprise when he slipped among us from a snowy corner, leading\na rough unsaddled colt, with a strap buckled over his loins to which a\nsword was attached on one side, and a rusty old musket on the other. An\nEnglish crowd would have gibed, I fear, at the menacing aspect of this\nfeeble ancient, and even Strogue made no attempt to hide a grin; but the\nLesghians glanced at him kindly, and made room for him among them, and\nhe plodded on resolutely without a word, like a fatalist come to look\nfate in the face.\n\nEven in a small lot such as we were, and consisting chiefly of hardy\nfellows, there must be--according to the varicose vein which runs\nthrough all humanity--three or four at least of softer pith, or\neruptions that arise to the occasion, or some thing or other that goes\namiss. And not having one leg too many among us, or I might say less\nthan half the legs we wanted, our hard fortune was that the briskest\nshank among us--which was not my own, though I did my best, and in\nSurrey would have challenged any of them--was obliged to stick fast,\nwhen it got too far ahead, and disguise its own gratitude for a thrill\nof rest, by turning on its heel disdainfully. In a word, nearly all our\nmost excellent men, brave and zealous, and brought up from childhood to\na good stroke of speed after other people's cattle, had lost the best\npart of their training, by compulsion--under Russian tyranny--to attend\nto their own flocks and herds, instead of lifting their neighbour's.\n\nThus it was that we came at last to an elbow of the great Russian road,\nwhich is a noble work, but not by any means such as we should make, if\nwe had the opportunity; and there we found a sample of what human nature\nis. Having surmounted, by wonderful endurance and perpetual rivalry with\none another, obstacles that seemed insuperable, surely we should have\ngone on with double spirit, when we came upon a Christian highway.\nInstead of that, every blessed man sat down, and thanked Heaven--or in\ntruer truth thanked himself--for having got along so famously. It was\ndark, as dark as one could ever wish to see it, down in this gorge of\nmagnificence, with the river roaring sleepy thunder, and the snow-clouds\nspent, and the stars looking faint. I thought--as an Englishman thinks\nby instinct--that men of our own race would not have stopped (at any\nrate if there was money in it) and shut up in this sudden style.\n\nHowever there was more excuse than help for it; and Stepan and myself,\nthe two who cared most deeply about the issue, tried to cheer each\nother, so far as our mutual misunderstandings reached.\n\nThen by a lucky chance the gallant miners (whom we should have missed\nperhaps, if we had gone on at once) came into our camp, with light\nhearts and merry songs, delighted at the prospect of a lively brush; for\nso they all regarded it. Jack Nickols himself had been unable to resist\nthe fierce temptation, and gloomy would be the outlook for any foe who\ncrossed his sky-line, though I cannot recollect just now his celebrated\nscore at the \"running deer.\"\n\nIt was terrible to me to find these fellows taking things so easily, not\nthrough any callous inhumanity or indifference, but simply because their\nown private interests were not immediately involved. For instance, the\nway in which Nickols, and Cator, and Strogue discussed the situation was\nenough to sponge out of my heart a great lump of that affection for the\nhuman race without which a man becomes miserable. Weary as they were,\nthey found it needful to hold some little council, while they smoked\ntheir pipes after supper, having settled that all should take four hours\nof sleep if they could get it, and start again when the moon arose. I\nsat in a corner and listened to them, refraining from all interruption,\nthough a great part of what they said was new to me; for if I had\nspoken, some heat might have followed my words, and done mischief to all\nof us.\n\n_Strogue._ \"I have always had the credit of seeing as far into a hayrick\nas any man that ever sucked a coral. But this fiend of a woman beats me\nhollow. I can't make out what her little game is.\"\n\n_Nickols._ \"Well, I can't see any difficulty about it. She wants her\nbrother's property, and to be the lady of the other tribe too, which she\nwould be as Dadian's daughter, if her brother Imar were done away with.\nShe will have him tried for the death of her husband, or get him shot\nwithout trial. Then she has discharged her duty according to the rules\nof the blood-feud, and she steps into poor Imar's shoes. To me it is\nplainer than a pikestaff.\"\n\n_Cator._ \"All that looks straight enough, but it won't hold water. You\nforget the pretty girl. Imar has a lovely daughter, and she would be the\nhead of the tribe, not Marva, when his goose is cooked.\"\n\n_Nickols._ \"That's true enough. But a woman with such a strong mind\nwouldn't make much bones of that. Or rather she'd make bones of her in\nno time. I am very sorry for that pretty girl. She is booked for a share\nof her father's grave.\"\n\n_Strogue._ \"Naturally I look deeper into things than you young fellows\ncan. The real difficulty has escaped you both. The woman is bad enough\nfor anything. I know things of her that I won't tell, at any rate for\nthe present.\n\n\"But as for making away with her niece, there are two good reasons\nagainst it. In the first place, the Russians would be almost certain to\npunish Madam heavily, though perhaps they would not interfere, if Imar\nalone were tried and condemned according to the usage of the country.\nAnd then again, even if they let it pass, the Lesghians, who are a very\nloyal race, would never accept Marva's rule, when she had slain their\nChief and his daughter. You have got the wrong story altogether,\naccording to my view of it. Her game is not quite so clumsy, though it\nis a very bold one.\"\n\n_Nickols._ \"Captain, you are one of those men who get the right tip\nalways. Don't be shy,--that would scarcely become you. But tell us\nexactly what you think; although it may be hard to square it with the\nhigher moralities.\"\n\n_Strogue._ \"You speak like a fool, as all boys do. But there is no time\nto board-school you; and you are getting too old for that rot even. Now\nlisten to what I have to say, though beyond the present range of your\nintellect. I have not dwelt among this mixed lot of savages; I have\nsimply passed through them in my usual course. You might live among them\ntill your hair grew white, and know less than you did when it was green.\nWhy? You are sharp enough in your way, and if you had started with a\nhumble mind, and kept it open, you might win knowledge. But that is not\nfine enough for you. You start with your poor wits already ingrained and\ncase-hardened with the grease and suet of self-conceit, and nothing ever\nsticks to you.\"\n\n_Nickols_, and _Cator_, and _I_, in the corner, with unanimous\nsurprise: \"Captain Strogue is the humblest of mankind, and therefore the\nmost omniscient!\"\n\n_Strogue._ \"It is true, my friends; a great home-truth, and you shall\ngather the fruits of it. I have penetrated this lady's scheme, and\ndeeply regret that so fine a woman, one of the handsomest I have ever\nseen, should not behave with equal beauty. Having sent her brother to a\nbetter world, she will bring his daughter to the altar as the bride of\nher noble son--noble indeed to look at, but unable as yet to say Boh to\na goose. He will be the master nominally of all Imar's fair dominions,\nwhich are as lovely as any in the world, when the snow allows a sight of\nthem. The real master, of course, will be a certain lady-friend of ours;\nfor you can see that from his cradle upwards she has cowed that\nuncommonly fine young fellow, so that he dare not call his soul his own.\nUpon my word I should not be surprised, when she has united these\ncentral tribes, if she threw off the yoke of Russia, and proclaimed\nherself Queen of the Caucasus, like a modern Tamara. All that is clear\nenough, but the one thing I can't make out for the very life of me is,\nwhy the dickens did she send us that scamp, whose real name is Hisar,\nunder the name of Hafer? She would not send the true Hafer of course,\nlest when he had been away for months, and seen the ways of the polished\nworld, and how absolutely the children rule their parents, he might be\nseized with emulation, and resolve to be master of his own domains, if\nnot of his own mother--though I am sorry for anybody who tries that. Now\ntell me, ye who flatter yourselves that you can see further into a\nmilestone than Strogue who has beheld so many, what induced this artful\nschemer to send Hisar to England in the name of Hafer, when for all that\nwe can see he might just as well have gone in his own name?\"\n\n_Nickols._ \"I was never any hand at crooked dealing, though there is\nplenty of it in our own line of business, but none with tip-toppers like\nmy uncle and me. We have a high character to sustain. Even supposing we\nwould stoop----\"\n\n_Cator._ \"Stow that, Jack, we know it all by heart. But I can tell the\nCaptain one good reason why the lady's ambassador should be called\n_Hafer_. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar was bound to receive his own nephew, when he might\nhave refused to see a stranger. And to take him into their confidence,\nand let him know their plans, and so on. All of which has enabled them\nto make fools of his faithful retainers, and prisoners of himself and\nhis daughter.\"\n\n_Strogue._ \"With half an eye open, I saw every bit of that. But it does\nnot touch the real difficulty. Dariel is to marry the true Hafer. Very\nwell, let her, if she likes. He's a young man of grand appearance; and\nthat reconciles the women to a lot of disadvantages. But if she was\nmeant to belong to him, why let another fellow get the start with her?\nThough women of decent age know better, a girl is sure to be romantic.\nShe piles wonders of imagination upon the first good-looking young\nfellow who suggests how lovely, how lofty, how divine she is.\n\n\"She keeps him at a blushing distance, and looks as if she had not the\nleast idea where he is, and would turn her head away if he came up.\nBless their hearts, I know them all; though I never let them see it. I\ncould have had fifty Mrs. Strogues,--for they love a man who knows the\nworld,--some of them too with cash and houses. But none of that for me,\ntill I want nursing. Half-a-dozen Miss Strogues here and there, some\nwhite, some black, and some the colour of an orange, or a good Mocha\nberry that you can't get now--and they behave all the better to you when\nthey know that you can do without them. Simple truth, gentlemen. I am\nnot romantic.\"\n\nThis was too much for Jack Nickols, who was truly in love with his Rosa.\nToo much even for Cator, though he had no love as yet to hold him. Young\nEnglishmen know right from wrong, though they do the wrong very often.\nBut they cannot bear to hear it boasted of. But to me, with Dariel in my\nheart, purifying and ennobling it, bad as the time was for a row, I\nshould have deserved no better time, if I had been afraid of it. So I\nmarched up, and laid my hand upon him.\n\n\"Sir,\" I said, without a sign of anger,--for such stuff was not worth\nit,--\"what you deserve, both of men and women, is to die in a workhouse,\nwith Mrs. Gamp and Betsy Prig to close your eyes. Bad women there must\nbe, as well as bad men; but tell me which has made the other? I know you\nbetter than to believe that you really think such wicked nonsense as you\ntalk, for the sake of seeming clever. Bartholomew Strogue is a better\nman than that.\"\n\n\"I should not be much surprised if he was,\" the Captain answered\npleasantly; \"and he can allow for babes and sucklings, who are the\nhappiest people after all. But come, my friends, I hear the sounds of\nsleep, the grinding of the mill of slumber. How those gallant Lesghians\nsnore! If the Caucasus is the true cradle of our race, sleep must have\nlost its silence before language was invented.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nA RUTHLESS SCHEME\n\n\nWhile these men were arguing thus (failing with all their ingenuity,\nperhaps, to hit upon the true state of the case) a scene which they\nwould have been glad to behold was taking place some twenty miles away,\nand not far from the banks of the Ardon. Here that river (on its way to\njoin the Terek below Vladikaukaz) rushes through a rugged and desolate\ncountry on the further side of Kazbek, where the fall of the land is\ntowards the north, and the long shadows lie in snowy stripes, even to\nthe suns of midsummer. This was the melancholy spot where Rakhan owned\nthat hunting-lodge, to which the poor Princess Oria had turned for\nrefuge, when the snows of autumn blocked the track. Here it was that\nImar (furious at her apparent guilt) found her most unhappily, at the\nvery moment when the faithful steward--whose presence would have proved\nher innocence--was gone to the nearest hut in search of provisions and\nhelp to clear the road. And here it was that she breathed her last,\nslain by her own hand, according to the ordinance of her ancient race,\nto expiate the intolerable insult of the man she loved and worshipped.\n\nBut now the woman who had caused her death, or led up to it so cleverly\nby her own malevolence, felt no misgivings about that. Betwixt twins,\neven of the kindest nature and clinging from their birth to one another,\na fungoid growth is apt to spring, as it does in a tree cleft down the\ncentre, but not allowed to part in twain. Either member of the impaired\nunion believes that the other belongs to it; and both are ready to close\nthe grip against all who would divide them. But as years go on, and\ndiverse attractions draw them more and more apart, each begins to form\nand thicken cuticle against the other; at least if they are of equal\nstrength. And then the stuff that vainly came to close the gap grows\nvenomous.\n\nJealousy, like a yellow toadstool, sprang up in young Marva's heart,\nwhen her brother dared to love another woman better than herself. She\nhad fallen away from the twinship first by giving herself to Rakhan,\nwithout a word to her brother, and sacrificing to passion all the tender\nties of kindred love. None the more could she endure that her brother\nshould do likewise; and she would not believe, although she knew it,\nthat her lover had murdered her father. Then when her husband made a\ngrievance of Imar's just refusal to pay marriage-portion to that\nmurderer--unless he would come and take the oath--she made a grievance\nof it too, more and more bitter as Rakhan began to make more and more\nspite of her poverty. And so it went on, with the crust of sullen temper\nthickening year by year, and the faith of married life turned sour by\nher husband's faithlessness, until her brother slew the wretch who had\nruined him and outraged her.\n\nFair fight it was, and if ever one man has the right to stop another\nfrom his evil deeds below, and give him chance of mercy ere his black\naccount grows blacker, the one might plead that right, and the other\naccept the relief with gratitude. But reason is less than a drop in the\nocean of a tempestuous woman's heart. Marva's ill-will towards her\nbrother deepened into bitter hatred, and nothing but his exile saved him\nfrom her brooding vengeance. And now she had found a chance of wreaking\nher wrath upon him to heart's content, and with the same blow satisfying\nher lifelong thirst for wealth and rule.\n\nTherefore now her black device was on its last bound towards success;\nand we, who rejoice in lawful acts, and tricks that can be justified by\nsolid legal argument, must bear in mind that her scheme was well in\naccordance with the local law.\n\nTo save all risk of being late for the ceremony of the morrow, she had\nquitted the stronghold where she allowed us the honour of that\ninterview, and crossing the mountains west of Kazbek by the Ardon\nwatercourse, had put up at this hunting-lodge, as the only suitable\ndwelling near the Valley of Retribution. About seventy armed men of the\ntribe, and a dozen village elders had been despatched to the Roman jail\nto keep guard, and prepare the trial; while she had only a few men with\nher, including the gentle Hafer, and the thoroughly savage Hisar.\n\nBut the lady as yet had no suspicion of our rapid counterplot, which we\nnever could have formed without the tidings and the help of Usi the\nBear-slayer, whom she had corded to the rock for wolves. And if we could\nonly have foreseen her sojourn at this hunting-lodge, what a dash we\nmight have made with the mining force alone and held our haughty captive\nas a hostage for her prisoners! But as yet we knew not where she was;\nand as to what may here be told it is scarcely needful to observe that\nit came to my knowledge afterwards. And often on our road we doubted, in\nspite of all we heard of her, whether that any woman in her right mind,\nand acting with cool intention, would compass a crime almost beyond the\nconception of a man soever vile. Although it was not for the sake of the\nhorror, but an indispensable part of her scheme, that her brother should\nbe slain by his own, and only son!\n\n\"Hafer,\" she said to this noble-looking youth, who believed himself the\nonly son of her injured husband Rakhan, \"at last the time is come for\nyou to vindicate your father. To-morrow his murderer will be condemned\nby the verdict of the elders of our tribe--the men who were faithful to\nyour father, the great Prince Rakhan of the Ossets. Your father died, as\nyou know too well, in the assertion of your mother's rights. Your uncle\nImar, my own brother, was gifted by Heaven with no sense of justice. He\nwas not content with robbing me, your dear mother, of my rightful share\nin my father Dadian's inheritance; but when your own brave father Rakhan\nvainly made suit after many years to obtain a small share of my rights,\nwhat did your uncle Imar do? You know, you have heard it a thousand\ntimes; he slew your father in cold blood, taking mean advantage of\nsuperior strength. He left me a widow, a helpless widow, with you my\nonly child almost a babe. Instead of remaining, like a man, to face the\nconsequence of his crime, and trying at least to make compensation, he\nfled to an island in the west called England, where all malefactors are\nsheltered and fed. There he lived in luxury for many years, receiving\nall the revenues which of right were mine. Now he has returned, without\na word of sorrow to me, to rob me of the little I have tried to save.\nYou know how hard I have striven against fortune, labouring to keep the\nscanty relics of my rights, and to take charge of small affairs that\nhave chanced to lose their owner. Even you I have been compelled\nsometimes to deprive of enjoyments to which your birth entitled you. Is\nit not the truth, my child?\"\n\n\"Mother, it is indeed the truth. I have often been ashamed of my desire\nfor more food. And yet it has been a pleasure to me to behold you never\nfamishing.\"\n\n\"A barley-cake has been enough for me. There are some who can so deny\nthemselves. But justice comes to those who wait, and bear their sorrows\npatiently. The murderer of your father has, even through his own bad\ndesigns, fallen into the hands of those to whom he owes so long a debt.\nWe have him beyond all power of escape. To-morrow he will be justly\ntried by those who know what he has done. The elders of this noble race,\nthe race of the white sheepskin, will have him placed before them. He\nwill be forbidden to poison the air with any lying speeches. His\nsentence will be death, and you--according to the law of ages--you are\nthe man to execute it.\"\n\nThe young man fixed his large and gentle eyes upon her face, in doubt\nwhether she could mean in earnest to enforce such a cruel task. Even the\nworst of tyrants threatens a great deal more than he means to do; and\nwhen it is a female tyrant, deeds can scarcely equal words, however\nstrong the whole may be. This youth had received enough of both,--the\nblast of words, the lash of deeds,--and a heart that was both just and\ntender had confused the brain by pouring vain emotions into it.\n\nThe lady met his eyes with more than the every-day contempt in hers. It\nwas not in her nature to make allowance for the result of her own work.\nStudiously from his infant days she had crushed all free-will out of\nhim; and yet she scorned him for having none. As fine a specimen of\nmanly growth as could be found in all the world was towering over her\ndark head, tall and stately though she was. She hated him for doing\nthat, and she scorned him for doing it in stature only.\n\n\"Am I to speak again?\" she asked, with a gaze from which his mild glance\nrecoiled. \"I have set your duty before you, Hafer; if you are coward\nenough to refuse it, another will discharge it for you; and according to\nthe ancient laws you will be imprisoned and starved to death. What will\nbecome of Lura then? She will love you, if you are a man. If not, she\nwill turn to Hisar, who is longing to prove himself more worthy, and all\nher beauty will be his.\"\n\n\"What has Hisar to do with this? He is always seeking to supplant me.\nYou speak as if I were a coward, because it is not my desire to shed\nblood of man or beast; those who have done no harm to me, why should I\ndo harm to them? Neither do I take heed of words, being brought up with\nreproaches daily, which it becomes me not to answer. But of Hisar I have\nno fear. It is the feminine voice that scares me, because it has always\nheld dominion, and is too rapid to contend with. You have never allowed\nme to obtain any skill in weapons, such as a full-grown man should have;\nneither have I desired to fight, which is worthy of wolves, and dogs,\nand hogs. But if Hisar thinks to take my place in the things which he is\ncoveting, Hisar is of ignoble breed, let him come and make trial of me;\nand let Lura come and see it, if her gentle nature does not shrink.\"\n\nHafer tossed his golden curls, and tried to look fierce; but nature had\nnot gifted him with that expression, neither had practice supplied the\nlack. And then he smiled at his own attempt, having much of his father\nImar's vein. No woman, worthy to be called a woman, could have looked at\nhim without admiration, and pity for all that he had suffered to take\nthe bold spirit out of him. But the woman who had crushed his life was\nenraged at this slight outbreak.\n\n\"Something more than vaunt is needful to establish claim to courage.\nHisar is brave; the maidens admire him, the fighting men are afraid of\nhim. If thou art too liver-hearted to avenge thy father's wrongs, a\nbraver youth will take thy place, and do thy duty for thee. It will not\nbe worth while to starve thee, Hafer, and to listen to thy craven\nshrieks. On thy forehead we will brand _Coward_, and expel thee from a\ntribe of men. Hisar shall be the Lord of Ossets, with Lura for their\nLady.\"\n\n\"For the Lordship I care not. Thou hast done thy best from my birth to\nmake me what thou art not--a woman. Hisar is more to thee than I am,\nthough he is but a stranger. But he shall never be Lord of Lura; for I\nknow that she hates him, and he would grind her into dust. For her sake,\nI will do this thing; loathsome as it is to me, since it must be done by\nsomebody. But remember one thing, if I am forced to this--never more\nwill I call thee mother.\"\n\n\"Poor fool! Does he think he will have the chance?\" she muttered, as he\nstrode away repenting already in his soft young heart of words that\nmight have been too harsh. \"Child of the detested Oria, better for thee\nto have died than led my own dear little one to his death. Thou hast\nescaped the precipice, but the Russian mines shall be thy doom. Hisar,\nwhere art thou, my son? Heardest thou what that spoon-pap said? This hut\nshall have a golden door, and walls of lapislazuli. Within it Oria slew\nherself; and within it her first-born has sealed himself for Siberia.\"\n\nHisar came forth from the inner room, so fateful to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, and for\nonce his surly face looked bright. Since his return he had thought scorn\nof his native land and all therein; but he durst not show his mother\nthat.\n\n\"Madam, it is nobly designed,\" he said, \"and all in strict accord with\nlaw. Pedrel first, he shall have his wages, for which he has dared to\nfollow me hither, and to plague me about marriage with his sister. Then\nto see that pious Imar fall by the hand of his sanctimonious son; to\nexplain to that sweet saint what he has done; and then to deliver him to\nthe Russians to be tried for parricide! It is high time to be quit of\nhim. He begins to show cheek, as the men of England say. I could have\nstabbed him yesterday, if it were not for spoiling your noble scheme.\nOh, mother, the eagles of Rakhabat alone can have brought thee such\ncounsel from the clouds above! I am clever, and full of great devices,\nbut never could I have invented this.\"\n\n\"My child, it is but one of many that have entered into my swift mind.\nWhen I was a girl among the nuns, to pass the winter nights, we used to\nrelate delightful stories, far more ingenious than this. The difficulty\nis not to think them, but to do them, to make a great success of them.\nThis we have not accomplished yet; but I see not how it can slip from\nour hands. So far, things have worked well for us. Even the weather has\ntaken our part. That spy of a Sv\u00c3\u00a2n is wolf's meat ere now, and there is\nnot a Lesghian this side of Karthlos. No fear of that meddlesome Briton,\nI trow, or of Stroke, the drunken traveller, who threatened to come\nafter thee.\"\n\n\"Would that I could catch them in our valleys, mother! George the farmer\nwould have small chance then of swinging his gun, and singing psalms\nwith the angelic Dariel! How I scorn and hate soft women! And they love\nme not. All love and liking hath gone to the meek and milky Lesghian\n'Hafer;' as thou hast chosen to call him. Therefore, to the Russian hell\nwith him! But of one thing I would warn thee, much admired and beloved\nmother. When we have torn the red cross down, and cast it beneath the\nwhite sheepskin, and filled our belts with the gold of Imar, not long\nwill I tarry in these dens of rock fit only for the hermit and the\nhuntsman. Of Selina I am already weary, and soon as my heart is weary\nboth of Dariel and Lura--since the ancient law allows us twain, which is\nless than the wisdom of the Moslem--I shall leave thee to command this\nsavage race, and take their tributes for me. Yearly will I come to see\nthee, and my two devoted wives, when the harvest-time is on, and cities\nare too hot to dwell in. But London and Paris, Paris and London, will be\nthe delight of Hisar.\"\n\nThe Princess had heard this more than once, and it did not distress her.\nShe had none to love or plot for now, except this savage Hisar, her own,\nbut unacknowledged son. Forsooth when Rakhan proved himself both brutal\nand faithless to her, and quitted her before the birth of the genuine\nOsset Hafer, and wandered with a light-of-love, the outraged wife took\nher revenge, according to the manner of the country, by encouraging a\nKhabardan chief, a bold and haughty Mussulman. Hisar, born of this\ntransmontane sally, about two years after the true Hafer's birth, but\nbefore his death at Karthlos, was of necessity kept from sight during\nevery return of Rakhan. That strong-willed savage, like many others,\nallowed unlimited action to himself, but passion only in the passive\nform to those who might have saved his soul, if there had been any heart\nbehind it.\n\n\"Thou art not fit to govern men,\" the Princess Marva looked at Hisar\nwith a smile of mild contempt, which would have been anything but mild\nto any other woman's son; \"but there is time enough to learn all that.\nFierce enough thou art; and that is the understreak of all government.\nAll the needful frauds will flow into thy noble spirit, when thy truest\nfriends and warmest loves have shown thee what the onyx is.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nTHE VALLEY OF RETRIBUTION\n\n\nUsi, the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n, came up to me, in the first gleam of the morning, when\nthe valleys were spiral snakes of white and the peaks were horns bedight\nwith rose, as in a Roman sacrifice. We had struggled and scrambled, by\nStepan's guidance, under the weak help of the moon, until jaded legs and\nburdened arms were like branches that droop with their own weight.\nStrogue most of all, after resting so long at the fountain of the\n_London Rock_, felt need of refreshment beyond the supply, and found\ntumbles less cheerful than tumblers. However, whenever we could stop to\nfeed he was as brisk as the youngest of the party.\n\nThen Usi, as I said, came round a crag with the light step of a\nmountaineer, and touched me on the elbow. I followed him into a piece of\nthicket, and there found our interpreter, a man of many accomplishments,\nand perceptive of their value. The Bear-slayer carried a long dull gun\nof ancient make and heavy substance, with the barrel stained by smoke\nand fire, and the carving of the stock turned black. Waving it proudly\nhe began to speak; and what he said was rendered thus, though\ninterpretation was growing needless as between his hits and mine.\n\n\"I am a man of piety not common among soldiers, and never yet heard of\namong the Sv\u00c3\u00a2ns. For this cause hath the Lord preserved me from wolves,\nand daggers, and Marva. And not only me hath He preserved, but also this\nlong pipe of Shamyl, this instrument of justice, renowned for laying low\nthe sinners who have persecuted Usi. From the blazing of fire and the\nhands of thieves the Almighty hath restored it for a holy purpose. I\nwill not boast; that now remains for the young man or the coward. But I\nhave seen in a dream of the night the proud eyes and the swelling breast\nlaid low.\n\n\"I have a scheme of my own devising, by which perchance the Lord of\nChristians, the greatest officer of Shamyl, and his dear child may keep\ntheir breath. Know you not that the murderers will guard their\ndungeon-gate in force, and as soon as we assault the valley, they will\nrush in and slay the prisoners? Of what avail will it be then, for us to\npour our strength in after them? Rather let the captain, and his brave\nmen, lie dark at the mouth of the valley, until the chief who hath\njustice in his eyes is brought forth for the death pronounced.\nMeanwhile, if there be any man young, and strong, and fearless, to whom\nthe lives of the prisoners are as precious as his own life, let him\ndescend and lie hidden in the valley between the murderers and the\nprison-gate, with an implement such as I have seen, but know not how to\nhandle, for it was not discovered in our war-time, a fire-arm which\ncontains the death of four men in close combat. Also let two men of\nstraight pipes--I myself will be one of them--lie in the wrinkle of the\ncliff, which is behind the prison-gate looking over it, and up the\nvalley. I know how to get to that hole unseen, for every crag is known\nto me. Also we two at the crafty minute can lower from the rocks the man\nwho is to hide in the valley; if a man can be found bold enough. I have\nspoken to this young son of the West, because he is strong and nimble, a\nlover of S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar also, and a worshipper of womankind. But if his\ncourage abide not with him to go down into the place of death, there is\na young Lesghian of better courage ready to encounter it. But he is not\nwell skilled in fire-arms. With wisdom have I spoken, as befits a son of\nShamyl.\"\n\nThe danger thus foreseen by the veteran sharpshooter had long been in my\nthoughts. Our attack upon the rear of the enemy, far away from the\ndungeon gate, would avail the prisoners not a jot, and only cause their\ninstant death, if the savage horde rushed at them first, as their leader\nwould probably command. Some one must be there to face them, at the\nfirst signal of the fight: for the straight course of the glen (which\nresembled in shape a drawn-out horseshoe) was nearly a quarter of a\nmile in length, and our appearance at the further end would leave plenty\nof time to stab those inside. But one man hidden in the glen itself, and\ntwo upon the cliffs above, might check the rush for a minute or two,\nuntil our main force dashed up behind. Yet to have six rifles on the\ncliff, and six revolvers in the valley--how much more effectual would\nthat be, as well as so much safer!\n\n\"Is there no room for more than one to lie concealed near the\nprison-gate, and for more than two upon the crag above?\"\n\nWhen the interpreter put my question, Usi shook his head, and turned his\nback upon me, as if he cared to hold no further converse with a craven.\n\"I would go myself,\" he muttered, \"if I had ever been taught to shoot\nwith pipes that are no longer than the honeycomb.\"\n\n\"Hearken unto my words,\" I spoke in the style of his own oration, \"O\nslayer of bears, the English heart hath as much endurance and contempt\nof peril, as ever was bred in the Lesghian or the untamed Sv\u00c3\u00a2n. From\nthis adventure I will not turn back, by reason of terror or the love of\nlife. Do thou consider these things apart, while I hold counsel with the\nCaptain of brave men.\"\n\nForty-two of us there were in all, without counting old Kobaduk or the\nfluent interpreter,--the one disabled by length of years, the other by\nprolixity of tongue. Time had failed us to muster more than twenty-two\nCaucasians, and eighteen British miners, with Strogue and myself to make\nup the force; but a match as we thought for twice that number of Ossets,\nor any other savage tribe. And we had the advantage of knowing much more\nabout their proceedings than they could know of ours; for Usi (who had\nleft us the day before to search his burned hut for the celebrated gun)\nhad made the best of his time in other ways, skirting the highlands\nround the valley at a prudent distance, and learning from a goatherd's\nboy what the proceedings of the morrow were to be. All these things I\nput plainly before Strogue as the commander of the expedition, and he\nfell in at once with the Bear-slayer's plan; while Jack Nickols (as the\nbest rifle-shot among us and a first-rate climber) volunteered to be\nUsi's partner in the dangerous enterprise among the cliffs. So we\nthree, Nickols, Usi, and myself, made every preparation we could think\nof, and set off with a quick step right early, in advance of the main\nbody.\n\nIn some of his tempers, Strogue was a very provoking and irritating\nfellow, and he knew it, I think; or he must have known it, whenever he\nlooked at Bat Strogue in the glass. But now I thought more of him than I\nhad ever thought before, because he behaved so kindly to me. For it must\nbe remembered that I had not always put up with his brag, and his\ncynicism, and contempt, or pretended contempt of women, and many other\nlittle ways that rasp the quiet Briton.\n\n\"Let Jack Nickols go; don't you go, George,\" he said to me, I daresay a\ndozen times; \"what matter if he gets a prod through the lungs? Take a\nlot of gabble out of him, if he ever came round again; if he didn't, one\ncoxcomb the less. He does think Treble X of himself; while you are\nalways so ready to learn,--it's a pleasure to hold a conversation with\nyou. And when a man comes to know you, George, he finds you not half\nsuch a fool as he thought! That is my experience at any rate, although I\nhave seen too much of men to pretend to know much about them. But nobody\nneed look twice at you, to understand you thoroughly. I am wanted here\nof course; but let that cock-headed young Nickols go; nobody would ever\nmiss him.\"\n\n\"Captain,\" I replied with emphasis, for I knew that he loved the\ntitle,--all the more perhaps as being of home-growth,--\"should I be\nworthy of your friendship if I allowed a young fellow quite a stranger\nto the case to undertake my duty?\"\n\n\"Well, well! God bless you! I shall never see you alive again. But I'll\nmake a rare example of the fellow that runs you through, dear George. I\nwish I had bought a six-shooter in London; however, the Lord be with\nyou. Be sure you kill four of them before you drop. That sham Hafer\nbelongs to me, mind, after all the tricks he has played me.\"\n\nThis was not encouraging; but there seemed to be no way out of it.\nNeither was there any genuine pluck in my volunteering; for as a mere\nquestion of selfishness, Dariel's life was worth to me a hundredfold as\nmuch as mine. Another thing was, that I had never felt sure whether\nnature had afforded me a decent share of that British pith, and presence\nof mind, and calmness, of which the father reads in the despatch, and\nsays, \"Thank God we are not going down the hill yet!\" while the mother's\neyes run over, and the brother wonders whether he could do the like, if\nthe pinch came to his own short ribs.\n\nSome people declare that dreams will tell us, when we can remember them,\nwhat our genuine nature is. If so, I have been told both ways; in some\nvisions, running like a niddering, in others standing firm as a pyramid.\nAnd now I found myself quite at a loss, although my mind felt firm\nenough, whether the body would toe the mark, stand steadfast, and act to\norders.\n\nHappily there was not much time for dealing with speculative terrors,\nfor we had to keep on at a rapid pace, to do any good with our\nambuscade. The sudden snowfall of the Sunday morning had not been so\nheavy on this northern side, but the track was very rough and crooked,\nas well as steep and slippery. So that Nickols and myself were ashamed\nto find the supple vigour of youth no match for the wiry endurance and\npractised precision of that ancient mountaineer. Then, at the crown of a\nterrible defile, he looked back, and ordered us to lie close, while he\ncrept down a narrow channel flanked with trickling combs of snow.\n\nWe were glad to have a breathing time, and Nickols proposed a quiet\nsmoke; but I would not hear of it, for the vaporous curls might be seen\nfrom below.\n\n\"Wonderful old buffer,\" Jack whispered with his hand to his mouth; \"I\nbelieve he could out-walk us both. I shall take to bear's grease when I\ngrow old. But I would like to shoot a match with him for his best\nbearskin, if the Amazon has not burned them all. By George, I shouldn't\nlike to be that lady though, with the long pipe bearing upon me. Have\nyou seen how his eyes flash and his lips twitch at the very name of that\nwoman? I do believe he has arranged all this for his private\nsatisfaction. But there goes the signal; we are to creep on carefully.\nMind you don't send a stone down hill.\"\n\nTaking our caps off, and stooping low so as not to jut out against the\nsky-line, we descended the shallow seam of rock, until we stood in a\nstony and briary hollow, as long and as wide as a sawpit. At the further\nend, brown Usi lay flat on his breast, and peered securely through a\nwattle of budding bush into the depth of the glen below. We joined him,\nand found ourselves in full command of the whole of the savage\nsolemnity.\n\nA heavy stone chair was planted near the middle of the valley, with a\nblack tent just behind it. On either side about a dozen dirty but\ndistinguished greybeards were squatting upon blocks of granite, wearing\nthe sheepskin head-dress, and the smock with fluted cross-belt, and\nholding long white rods, as if in trial or in council. There was no one\nin the high chair as yet, but a young attendant stood on guard,\nsmoothing now and then the pile of leopard-skin thrown over it. Further\nup the valley I could see a lot of Osset warriors, lounging in their\nusual way, some even squatting down and smoking, and scarcely any two\ndressed alike. Reckless fellows, and rough as wolves--it was difficult\nto count them; but at a guess I set them down as from eighty to a\nhundred, gallant men, no doubt, but looking better trained to rob than\nfight.\n\n\"Take it all in; shape it all to know every inch of it in your mind,\"\nJack Nickols whispered kindly; \"now is your time, George Cranleigh. It\nmay save your life, when it comes to the rush. Did you ever see anything\nmore lovely?\"\n\n\"Very fine for the fellows who are safe up here,\" I answered less\npolitely, and knowing (without advice of his) how much I had to think\nof.\n\nBut even in that nervous state, one could not behold without thinking\nabout it, the strange way in which the hand of nature had cut and shaped\nand almost furnished a theatre of the mountains here. The sides of the\nglen were of yellow rock, or rather perhaps of a dun colour, nowhere\nless than a hundred feet in sheer height, or beetling over; while the\nlevel spread of the bottom was, like a frame drawn by a tapestry-worker,\nsoft and rich and tissued smoothly, only of the brightest green, shot\nhere and there with play of gold, like a carpet woven of lycopod. Usi\nsaid that the people told him snow would never lie down here, neither\nwould any coarse weed grow, but only moss and the dews of heaven, for\nmagnanimous heroes who slept below. And he said that the grey rocks,\nstanding forth at the broad end we looked down upon, were tombstones,\nwhich had sprung like mushrooms where the Captains of those heroes lay.\n\n\"Imar and the lovely maiden,\" he said; as he struck his heel on rock,\nand Nickols told me what he meant, \"are a hundred feet beneath us now.\nIf you could drive an iron down, it would pierce the roof above their\nheads. But lo, one man has been slain already, condemned in the holy\nweeks and kept till now. A traitor, and an extortioner, by the black\nstake driven through him. The corpse is out of sight from the judgment\nyard, though I can see it plainly. By the dress he was of the Western\nraces, such as you yourselves are; but a small man, weak, and of no\naccount; perhaps an English slave purchased for his own use by Hisar.\n\n\"Now see, my son, where that horn of rock stands forth. When the wise\nmen put their heads together, by this rope we will let thee down, if\ntrembling cripple not thy strong limbs. The fighting men will not behold\nthee, because of the folding of the crag; the heads of men that are\nwhite with wisdom will be bowed into that of the wealthiest, while they\nwhisper to one another _death_. And the woman will abide unseen within\nthe tent. Therefore do thou quickly thus. As soon as thy feet are on the\nmoss, cut the rope, stop not to untie it, fall on thy breast, and crawl\ninto that hole--my finger shows it now--where slab of stone leans unto\nstone, and the body of a large heart may lie hidden. I saw it in the\ntwilight before they caught me; but like a fool I went not in. Within\ntwenty yards, thou wilt see the iron bars where S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar will be\nshackled to receive the death. Keep thy head below the brim, even as the\nsalesman scrimps his bushel, and thine eyes as deep as his, when he\nseemeth to heed nothing. Thine own strong head and heart will guide\nthee, when it comes to stabbing. At the sight or the sound of thy\ndownstroking we will shoot; and the Captain's force will rush up the\nvalley. Bear in mind that thou hast chosen this; and death comes only\nonce to man; and by the God on high, thou shalt be avenged on the\nwicked men that slay thee.\"\n\nThis ought to have been warm comfort to me, according to all great\nwriters, and the general practice of mankind. But it failed to kindle\none fibre of my system, and I dropped my eyes that the heartless slayer\nof many bears, and men thrice as many, might not behold the affliction\nin them which he would be sure to take amiss. It was not terror (I would\nwish to think), so much as pity for my father and dear mother, and\nGrace, and Harold, and the farm, and the horses, and the dogs I loved,\nand most of all for Dariel; also a good deal for myself, who went hand\nin hand with her in every thought of mine. But the less I thought and\nfelt, the better; for the time was now to act.\n\nWe crept unseen to the spur of rock which Usi had called a \"Horn;\" and\nthere they made the rope fast around my chest, and I passed a\nhandkerchief round the breech of my revolver, and slung my kinjal and\n_toorak_ securely, for I had taken kindly to that native weapon, made of\nthe long horn of a mountain-goat, laden with lead, and bound with\nleather. Then at the proper moment when the judges or the\njury--whichever they were--had gathered in a ring to consummate their\nfarce, from the lip of the cliff I was let down softly, and lowered so\nskilfully in the buttress corner of a crag, that I reached the bottom\nwith both feet ready, and only a little skin gone from my thumbs. There\nI cut the rope, and fell flat among the moss, which grew to the very\nplinth of cliff, and wormed my way, with the slab for a screen, until I\ndived into the hole at its base. Here I rubbed my knees, which had\nreceived a bruise or two, and began with great caution to survey the\nscene. For the little pit into which I had crawled was scarcely more\nthan a yard in depth, but protected at the top by a smaller slab of\nstone, which rested with a wide slope against the upright rock, as the\nspur of a wooden fence is reared above the ground, and splayed against\nthe post, to steady it.\n\nAt the lip of my refuge a grey plant grew with woolly leaves, something\nlike mullein, and although it had not got much growth yet, it afforded\nme precious shelter, when I raised my head to peep around; for it partly\nclosed the three-cornered gap, between the upright and the sloping\nstone. It is not in my power to make a list of all that I saw, being in\nso quick a terror; but the things that I was able to twist my neck to\nwere enough to make me sorry for the colour of my hair.\n\nIn the butt-end of the cliff, which I had just dropped down, I beheld a\nwide door of dark metal, and the gleam of it was more of bronze than\niron. What the metal truly was, no man would stop to ask himself, but\nrather stand in wonder, and be overcome by the solid mass and magnitude,\nand the strength of ancient times. All the sons of Caucasus might have\ncome together, and done their very best for a century--if nature allowed\nthem such length of strength--but even with the Genoese smiths to help\nthem, they could never have built such a door as that. A door I call it,\nthough I may be wrong; others would take it for a gate perhaps. But\nbeing all in one plane and flat, and having no frame in sight, to me it\nwas a door, and a marvellous door, beyond our power to make or even to\nbreak open. On either side of it were two long loop-holes, like the\nlancet-windows in our church at home, but carved in the solid rock, too\nnarrow for even a child to squeeze his little shoulders through. And I\nknew that in the chambers (quarried thus by Roman steel eighteen\ncenturies ago), waiting for their doom, were the chief whom I admired,\nand the lady whom I loved.\n\nThere was nothing more to be made of that; not even a sign that S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar\nknew what the savages outside were doing. But as I thought of him,\nlabouring for years, girding up the slack folds of a life, from which\nall the gladness of the world was gone, simply for the benefit of these\nwretches,--genuine indignation filled me, and I longed to shoot a tribe\nof them. This it was, and no true courage, which enabled me to regard\nthe whole, with a calm heart and a solid head, like the oak, which is\nour emblem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nAT THE BAR\n\n\nHow long those ragged elders carried on with their pretence of trial, is\nbeyond my power to say. I only know that my joints began to stiffen with\ncramp, and to ache with crush, and my brain to hum like a factory wheel.\nEven the relief of descrying Usi or Jack Nickols, on the bristly brow of\ncliff a hundred feet over the dungeon-gate, was more than they dared to\nafford me now; though I tried to persuade myself once or twice that I\nespied the glint of metal there. Neither was there sound or sign of life\nwithin the rocky jail, so far as watchful eyes and ears could learn;\nwhile the cackle of the greybeards some fifty yards behind me resembled\na drone of bagpipes enlivened by a cherry-clapper.\n\nAt last I beheld a stately woman advance from the cover of the private\ntent and take her seat in the chair of law, to receive the verdict of\nher puppets. Then some hypocritical farce ensued, as if she were\nshocked, and pleaded with them, and mourned to find them so inexorable.\nMy heart burned within me, and my fingers tingled to pull trigger at\nsome of them, such a fierce and dirty lot were they; but I said to\nmyself, \"Let Hisar come, the fellow that broke the lovebird's leg.\" Then\nas if the scene that could not be avoided was unfit for such gentle\neyes, the Princess, with a bow of resignation, retired into the sable\ntent.\n\nI lay close, and drew my head in, while four or five of the fighting men\nfollowed the hoary villain who had acted as chief-justice to the door of\nheavy metal sunk in the dark embrasure of the cliff. The old man drew\nforth a key as long as a toasting-fork and much bigger, and with brawny\narms thrusting in both directions, and a screech as if from wounded\nrock, the valves of the door slid back into their bed, as the damper of\na furnace slides. But one broad bar of metal spanned the opening\nhorizontally, about five feet above the iron threshold. The Osset\nwarriors stooped their white head-dresses under this heavy bar, and\ndisappeared in the gloom inside. That they would not slay their\nprisoners there I knew, from Usi, and from Stepan's tales.\n\nPresently they appeared again with a figure in the verge of sunlight,\ntowering over their woolly gleam.\n\nI saw S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's noble face, as calm as when he smiled on me, and\nblessed me with his daughter. His hands were roped behind his back, his\nsilvery curls uncovered, and his broad white chest laid naked; except\nthat the red cross hung upon it, in which he wore some of his dead\nwife's hair. Two of the men stretched spears behind him, as if he would\nshrink from the steps of death; but he walked as if he were coming to\nwelcome some expected visitor, bowed his head without a word, and laid\nhis breast against the bar. There they cast a broad shackle round him\nand made it fast behind his back; while a pompous dotard stood forth the\ndoor, and read (or made believe read) the verdict of his brother idiots.\nAs he finished, my pistol muzzle lay true upon the foremost of them; the\nman who first put hand to kinjal would never have put it to his mouth\nagain.\n\nThen to my surprise, they all withdrew, cackling in their crock-saw\nthroats, while that old fiend showed his gums like a rat-trap, grinning\nthrough his rheumy scrub. And the sound of tongues up the valley ceased;\nand the blowing of horns, and the shrilling of fifes; and the only thing\nthat I could hear was the slow beat of a sheepskin drum, to call the\nsavages to the death, and the rapid thumps of my own heart.\n\nListening for the fatal step, I fixed my eyes once more upon the bound\nand helpless victim. Perhaps to reduce his well-known strength, or to\nlower his high courage, the affectionate sister had kept in his body\njust life enough to last till he should be killed. His ribs stood forth,\nand his cheeks were meagre, and the eyes looked worn and sunken; but\nthere was not a sign of fear or flinching, no twitch or quiver in the\nsmooth white forehead, and not so much as a palpitation in the broad\nbreast laid against the bar. Like a fool I raised my hand a little and\ntried to attract his notice, but he kept his calm gaze towards his foes;\nuntil a low heart-broken wail from an inner cell of the caverned rock\ntold of a sorrow beyond his own. Then for a moment he turned his head,\nand spoke some words of comfort perhaps, or of love and long farewell,\nto the one who could not come to him, or perhaps not even hear him; and\nI hoped in the Lord of mercy that she could not see her father. At the\nthought of that possibility even, hot as I was, my blood ran cold. Could\nany woman exist who would set such a sight before a woman?\n\nSuddenly a glow of deep amazement shone in Imar's haggard eyes. With a\nwrench of his mighty frame he shook the steel bar like a ribbon, the\nshackles on his chest gave way a little, and his grand face issued from\nthe gloom of granite into the testimony of the sun. Then the strong\naspect and vivid lines--as firm as the cliff to confront their\ndoom--relaxed and softened, and grew bright, as if memory forgot its\nage, and went back upon its years, to have a play with tender visions.\n\n\"Oria, come at last!\" he cried, with a smile to tempt her nearer; \"my\nOria sent to call me home! The God, who has done this for me, will take\ncare of my daughter!\"\n\nBefore him stood--betwixt him and me, although I had heard no\nfootsteps--a tall young figure in a long white robe, timid as a woman,\nand as graceful; but with supple strength quivering for the will to man\nit. On the left hip hung a heavy sword; but the right hand had fallen\naway from the hilt, and the shoulders lay back with the sudden arrest.\n\"My son, my son, it is just,\" cried Imar; \"slay me, as I slew thy\nmother.\"\n\nThen the shackled man turned his head away, that his eyes should make no\nplea for him, and nature's dread could be seen in nothing but the quiver\nof his long arched throat.\n\nBut the young man stood as if carved in stone, with both arms stretched\nto his father, unable to take another step, unable to do anything but\nwonder.\n\nBut betwixt their gaze a dark form leaped, quivering with fury, and wild\nfor blood, too ravenous for slaughter to have formed a proper plan of\nit. And this was a very lucky thing for me.\n\nFor while he danced between them thus, with his hateful face on fire, in\nthe voluptuous choice of murder, there was time for me to leap out of my\nhole, and get my cramped limbs flexible; not a moment, however, for any\nkind of thought, and whatever I did was of instinct. What it was I know\nnot, nor does anybody else; it can only be told in a whirl as it befell.\n\nHisar, I think, made a jump at Hafer, before he saw me, and smacked his\nface (as if he had been a child), and tried to snatch his sword, but was\nthrust back, and then drew his own, and flew with it at the shackled\nImar's heart. But another was there--thank the Lord in heaven--I caught\nthe flame of Hisar's eyes on mine, as his blade went straight for Imar's\nbreast, and dashed it into splinters with my _toorak_. Then he hurled\nthe stump at me, drew his kinjal, and sprang, as if he were made of\nwings, at my breast. I stepped aside quicker than I ever moved at\ncricket, and as he passed me he ran against so hearty a whack upon his\nwicked temples, that no more sin was concocted there.\n\nDown he went, like a thistle at the ploughshare, and threw up his long\nlegs, and lay dead, with a tuft of bloody moss between his teeth. I took\nthe stump of his sword, which had struck me in the breast, and cut S\u00c3\u00bbr\nImar free, and hurried him inside (for he was lost as in a vision), and\nstood with my revolver in the doorway, ready for the onset of the\nfighting men. These being taken with astonishment hung back, as if they\nhad none to lead them; until the great lady appeared from the tent, to\nreceive the tidings of her brother's death.\n\nMarva came forth in her majestic manner (having turned away her face,\nperhaps with sisterly compunction), sweeping her black robe along the\nground, and framing her handsome features to the proper expression of\nregret. Now the desire of her life was won. Paramount of the Eastern\nOssets, and the Western Lesghians; quit of the brother who had thwarted\nher, and his son whom she had stolen for revenge and guile; nothing\nremained but to make her own son the heir,--for he was born in wedlock,\nthough not of it,--marry him to the Lesghian heiress, and herself enjoy\nall the power and the wealth, while he took his pleasure in the western\nworld. She despised all the ignorance and superstition round her too\nloftily to act down to it; and perhaps looked down upon herself a\nlittle, as she took her seat in the chair of stone. None the less she\ndid it with a royal air, more impressive to us from a woman than from\nman.\n\nTo recover my breath, and be ready, I drew back in the shadow of the\nprison entrance, where Hafer was standing by his prostrate father; and\nmuch as I longed to see all that happened, for the moment I was out of\nit. Not that I should have been much wiser even in the midst of them,\nknowing nothing of the Osset tongue, which sounds like a chorus of\nbull-frogs, bagpipes, pigs under a harrow, a cock in the roup, and a\nhooter at the junction, even when the men are calm and keep the women\nsilent. However, those who understood them tell me that they reported\nthus.\n\n\"Oh, lofty lady, mother of thy tribe, widow of the great Prince Rakhan,\nthe sentence hath been given according to thy will, and carried out even\nas the Heaven hath decreed.\"\n\n\"Wise men, speak not of any will of mine; whatever hath been done is\ngood and righteous, to establish justice, and avenge the wrong. The barb\nof the arrow of the Lord flies straight; never can it fail by any\ncrookedness of men. Yet the great Prince who has fallen was the nearest\nof all flesh to me. I will be content with your testimony. I cannot gaze\nupon him.\"\n\n\"But--but we know not how to say it, so as to mingle truth with\npleasure. Oh, lofty lady, it is not our enemy, Imar of the Kheusurs, who\nis dead. Rather is it sorrowful indeed for us to speak. Would that the\nLord had made us liars, when He hath cast the truth into the breast of\nevil!\"\n\n\"Wise men, what is it? Or am I to call you fools, if ye could not even\nexecute your own decree aright?\"\n\n\"It is no deed of ours. It is a spirit from the tombs, the tombs that\nwere made before the world itself. Let the high lady come and see.\"\n\nShe was girding up her long robe while they spoke, and the jewels on her\nshapely feet flashed forth. With a gesture of disdain she waved the old\nmen back, but a score of wild warriors followed her, as she strode\ntowards the dungeon, to see her brother's corpse. Instead of that, she\nstood before the body of her son, and a loud shriek proved that she was\nstill a woman. From the gloom of my shelter, I saw her proud eyes\naghast, and her arms thrown up, and her tall form quivering. Then she\ncontrolled herself, and looked around.\n\n\"To weep by-and-by,--to avenge him first,\" she shouted (as they told me\nafterwards), and such is the power of another's passion that I felt like\na murderer, and went forth with an impulse of shame to surrender myself.\nFor I had never slain a man till now.\n\n\"Idiot, get back!\" cried a voice from the cliff, the voice no doubt of\nJack Nickols.\n\n\"Slay him,--shoot all of you, shoot, shoot, slay him!\" the lady called\nout, and herself seized a gun; \"shoot him, though it be through my own\nbody!\"\n\nThis order was beyond my understanding; but I saw at least a score of\nmuzzles looking at me, and I had not even the wit to move.\n\n\"Which will first reach me, the sound or the bullets?\" That I should\nthus ponder shows clearly enough that fear had overcome all sense of\nterror.\n\n\"Now then; cut it short,\" I said, according to Jack Nickols,--though I\ncannot remember a word of it,--and the fellows were surprised, and drew\ntheir clumsy fingers back, and went down on their knees with\nsuperstition. But the Princess Marva drew near to me, and the butt of a\ngun was against her hip. She saw that I stood unarmed and nerveless, and\nshe could not help playing with the joy of her revenge. To be shot by a\nwoman! I had no power left. I could only stare, and wait for it.\n\n\"But I know him, I recognise my dear friend,\" she exclaimed in French,\nwhile she fingered the trigger, with the muzzle not two yards from my\nbreast; \"it is the gentleman desirous of my emeralds. Ah, thou shalt\nhave them! How many? Ten?\"\n\nTo prolong my agony, she began to count, with glittering eyes and a\ncourteous smile, tapping my time on the trigger; and would you believe\nthat I could not stir, and could only keep my gaze fixed on her? Then\nas she cried _Seven_, a white spot leaped--as it seemed to me--from the\npalpitant surge of her bosom. Her dark robe opened, and her musket\ndropped, as the roar of a gun rang overhead, and the Princess sank, with\nher lips still smiling, as dead as a stone, into low-born arms.\n\n\"Usi, the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n, hath his revenge!\" a shrill cry from the crags\nproclaimed; \"Wolf's meat hath choked the Queen of Wolves.\"\n\nFear fell on all of us, as if the sky had opened; and the warriors\ngrounded their guns upon the moss, and crowded round one who had an\nimage on his breast. Then with one accord they began a mournful howl, of\na quality to come from the bowels of the earth, or send all her\ninhabitants into them. My presence of mind was restored by this; and\nwith scarcely a wound I leaped back into my shelter, recovered my\nweapons, and determined to die hard.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nHARD IS THE FIGHT\n\n\nWhat right had I to be out of breath, after standing stock-still no one\nknows how long, like a cardboard dummy to be shot at? But there seemed\nto be a hollow where my heart in its duty should have been staunch and\nsteadfast; and my brain (having never been wrought up like this) must\nhave lost its true balance and standard. Otherwise could it have shocked\nme to know that a career of cruelty and wickedness was brought to an\nignominious close?\n\n\"Marva is dead,\" I kept on saying; \"the greatest woman of the age is\ndead! Not the best, not the purest, not even a true woman. But how grand\nwas her attitude, and how she disdained me! And now a wretched Sv\u00c3\u00a2n has\nshot her!\"\n\nLet any one despise me as he likes, with reason on his tongue and\nhumanity in his eyes. For the world at large it might be better to have\nsuch a woman stretched beneath the turf; but a man with his heart in the\nright place--which the muzzle of her musket knew too well--could not\nhelp feeling for her grandeur.\n\nHowever, it was not for me to lay down the law, or even to stand up for\nit against this crew of savages. To keep out of their way was my one\ndesire, and at first there seemed to be some chance of it, with their\nleader a corpse, and superstition frowning at them from the\ndungeon-gate. Hoping thus, I stood back in a niche of granite, while a\nbullet or two sang along the vault, and I strove to recover the spirit\nof a man, by thinking of my country and the luck we have in turning the\ncorner of situations, where others would lie down and breathe their\nlast.\n\nThe bar to which S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar had been bound was still in place; but he was\nnot in sight, neither could I see his son, the gentle youth sent to\nassassinate him. Then I heard the sound of heavy blows, and concluded\nthat the younger man was striving to release his sister, while the\nfather lay half-conscious still from brutal cruelty and want of food.\nThere was none but myself to guard the entrance--for Usi and Nickols had\nnot appeared--until our friends at the valley's mouth should have time\nto come to the rescue.\n\nGlad was I to think, as I did at first, that the savage warriors, scared\nand puzzled, and without a leader, would now hang back; as they had done\nwhen the Lesghian chief brought their Prince Rakhan to account. And so\nit would have been, by their own confession, but for the ferocity of one\nyoung man, Karkok the brother of Lura, and the chief friend of that\nHisar whom I had struck down. Karkok cannot have been stirred up by\nlove, or loyalty, or any other noble motive,--for who could have\nregretted Hisar?--but by ambition of the meanest sort, and a dash at the\nmastery of the tribe, for he was now the last relative of Rakhan.\n\nThis upstart fellow brought the fighting men together; and they laid\naside the bodies of Queen Marva and her son, in fear of their being\ntrampled on; and then (with a screech that must have set all the teeth\nof the flintiest echo aching) at the prison-gate they rushed, and the\nvalves being back there was only my poor body between them and the\nhelpless inmates.\n\nWhen I saw those fellows advancing upon me, capering, and flinging hairy\narms about, and tossing white sheepskins, and flourishing long muskets,\nbeyond any denial I was frightened, and would have given every penny I\nwas worth to be in my own little saddle-room once more. My hand shook so\nbadly that the blue revolver revolved without any mechanism; and the\nprudence which has been implanted in us all suggested that the bravest\nman must value his own bacon. When a friend assures me that I was\ngloriously brave, it would be a rude thing to contradict him; but what a\ndifferent tale my conscience tells!\n\nIn a word, just presence of mind enough was left me to show that I must\nfight it out. To make a bolt of it was useless, for whither could I go?\nAnywhere across the cave would bring a bullet into me; and as for\nslinking along the dark wall, where would that take me, even if I could\ncontrive it? Into the very arms of Dariel,--a truly sweet refuge, but\nnot for a coward. All I could do was to say to myself that the lines\nwere hard, but the Lord had made them so, and I must trust in Him to\ndeliver me.\n\nWhether it were faith, or sense of justice, or the love of woman, or\nsomething far lower than any of these, the brute element inborn in the\nsons of men,--no sooner did I see hateful eyes agoggle with lust for\nblood glaring at me, and great mouths agrin for a grab at me, than the\nlike spirit kindled in myself.\n\n\"Blood you shall have, but it shall be your own first,\" I shouted in\nEnglish, and leaped at them from the mouth of the cave, like the demon\nof Kazbek. They took me for that great power, and fell back, while a\nball slit the tip of my ear off, and before they could rally there were\ntwo as dead as stones with bullets in their heads, and two more fell\nupon them with their skulls cracked by the swing of my _toorak_. \"Want\nany more?\" I asked, having two charges left, and many of them showed the\nbetter part of valour. But a kinjal was thrown at me down a lane of\ncowards, and stuck in my breast, and that rallied the crowd. Three or\nfour made at me from behind, and I know not how it was, but down I went\nfrom a terrible whack on the back of my head, at the very same moment\nthat I shot their new chief.\n\nA very lucky shot, and one that governed all the issue. But of that I\nknew nothing until weeks had passed, my latest sense being of a white\nflash across me, and a plunge into a bottomless abyss of some one, who\nmight be anybody. \"There let him lay,\" as a great poet says--and never\nwould he have stood up again, if his skull had been of Norman growth.\n\nBut a mighty champion just in time had rushed into the thick of it, and\nscattered a storm of sword-flash, as the lightning fires a forest. Two\nruffians, poised for the final stab at my defenceless body, swung\nbackward with their arms chopped off, and the blade that should have\ndrained S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar's blood revelled in the gore of his enemies. For the\nfury of the mild and gentle \"Hafer\" (now that he had learned his wrongs\nand guessed his father's) swooped on those sheep-clad fiends, as a\nwhirlwind leaps upon a drying-ground of tallow candles. Would that I had\nonly kept sufficient sense to see, for they tell me that it was\nmagnificent. Heads that are full of hate should have some of it let out,\nand several of the worst were stopped for ever from receiving any more\nmisanthropy. All who knew anything about it said that Rakhabat himself,\nthe worst man-hater of all the demons of Kazbek, was seen to come down\nwith the wings of a black eagle, and enter the vesture of the white\n\"Lamb-angel.\" That was the Osset name for this poor Prince; and now\nhaving broken bounds, he proved the irony of his claim to it. For soon\nthe chief-justice of the court went down, and so did the foreman of the\njury, and a pair of clerks who sought nothing but their living, and\nothers who had come to see things out without any view to their own\nexit. Among them raged \"Hafer,\" like Hector of Troy, with twenty years,\nand more than that, of goodness to let out; and no man could shoot\nstraight at him, because he was in the right, while all their guns were\ncrooked.\n\nNevertheless the force of numbers must have been too great for him,--for\nthe conscience of Ossets still requires to be formed,--but for the rapid\nand resistless charge of Stepan and Strogue, and the Lesghians, and the\nminers, down the long valley, and over the moss reeking already with\nmore blood than it could staunch. At the same moment Usi, the Sv\u00c3\u00a2n, and\nJack Nickols, who had been hampered by some tangle of the rope, shouting\nto their comrades, fell in upon the flank; and the noble tribe of\nOssets, or at any rate that branch of it, split up and fell asunder like\nan unroped fagot. There can be no certainty of justice in this world;\nbut even the races connected with them by the tenderest ties of\nco-robbery found it in their hearts, when the facts could not be\naltered, to pronounce the only verdict--\"Served them right.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nBUT NOT IN VAIN\n\n\nIn recounting my little adventures--as I am begged sometimes to do--upon\ncoming to this particular part my general practice is to stop, as if I\nhad no more to say. Whereas it is only that I want to know in which of\nthe persons concerned my friends appear to take most interest. And to my\npride, more perhaps than to my credit, their first question always is,\nnot \"What became of you, George?\" but \"What became of Dariel?\" And that\nis more than I could tell for many a long day afterwards.\n\nWhen the door of her cell was beaten in, she came forth as in a dream or\ntrance, without any wonder, or fear, or question, possessed by one\npurpose alone,--to share the fate of her dear father. In the gloom of\nthe tunnelled rock she glanced at the tall form of her brother, but the\nlight even there was enough to show that this was not the one she\nwanted. And he, having reason from very early days to give a wide berth\nto the feminine form, drew aside gladly for a strange young lady to go\nher way without compressing him.\n\nFor this young fellow, Prince Origen, the son of Imar and Oria, the\nchild who escaped by his fall into the drift (when Marva's genuine Hafer\nperished), being substituted for him, and brought up with plenty of\nchastisement, and strict privations, and a candid absence of affection,\nhad never been encouraged to think, or act, or even to feel for his poor\nyoung self.\n\nWhat then could be expected of him, when in a moment at one blow the\nwhole of his world was cut from beneath him, his own identity plucked\naway, and not even a quiet corner left for considering who he was, or\nhow he came to be? In such a case is it surprising that his head went\nround so rapidly that he might fairly be said to have lost it? Instead\nof attending to his new-found father, he had simply stood staring at the\nprostrate form, till moans of despair from that inner cell were brought\nto his ear by the chilly draughts of rock. Thereupon he rushed in, and\nwhile I kept the entrance, he used his great strength to such purpose\nthat his unknown sister glided past him and hurried to their unconscious\nfather. And truly it was a great mercy for me, as well as a glory to\nthis grand young fellow, that, instead of waiting longer where he was\nnot wanted, he ran out at once to obtain fresh air, and get some light\nshed upon so many marvels. Rapid action and muscular exertion, for which\nhe found ample cause at once, probably saved him from congestion of the\nbrain, and certainly saved me from perforation of the heart.\n\nFor why should I make light of my defeats, any more than extol my\nvictories, which latter it would be hard to do by reason of their\nnonentity? Those Ossets had performed an exploit declared to be\nimpracticable by all the bravest sons of Wykeham during my generation.\nThat is to say, they had cracked my skull, which was not a piece of\nbiscuit china, but of solid and heavy metal, sounder I trow than its\ncontents. And those who have studied the subject tell me that the\nthicker the pot is, which nature has provided for our poor brains to\nboil in, the more ticklish the job is to make good the splinters. What\ntinker can patch an enamelled saucepan? And a queer saucepan must our\nbrainpan be, if, after all the smut shed round it and the slow smoke\nunder it, any steam of self-conceit still has a puff to lift the cover.\nLet any man who thinks himself a wonder get a bit of his skull (too\nsmall perhaps for a chick to pick up for the good of his gizzard)\ncrumbled in upon the brain he is so proud of; and if he has the luck to\nmeet with a friend who can get it out again, when he comes to know his\nown name once more, will he count it worth remembering?\n\nBut as for myself--because perhaps I had never thought wonders of\nit--trouble beyond belief was needful ever to make it sound again. When\nI came to know the facts--as I did at last--it may appear a singular\nresult, but as true as I sat up in bed, the salt tears ran into my soup\nso fast that they had to give me another basin. Not through any\nweakness, as an ill-natured man might fancy, but just because I was so\nhappy to come home to a world where loving folk were living, and people\nbetter than myself, who wished to keep me with them.\n\nPerhaps I ought not to talk about it, and yet it seems shabby and\nungrateful not to say how much they had done for me. Here was my sister\nGrace, together with her husband Jackson Stoneman, rushing from the\nhoneycomb of their blue moon among the soft Italian lakes into the\n\"horrid Caucasus;\" and bringing with them by telegraph to Surrey that\nwonderfully clever Dr. Hopmann, to whose skill I owe it that my reason\nwas restored as good as ever it was before, and perhaps even better, for\nwhen it came back it had slept in the dew of humility.\n\nBut the doctor's humility was not increased, neither deserved it so to\nbe. Because the most eminent physician at Tiflis, a Frenchman of vast\nrenown, being called in at once by my host S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, had pronounced all\nsurgical operation futile, and declared that the owner of that battered\nbrain might linger on for weeks, until inflammation kindled, but could\nnever be better than an imbecile, even if he failed to satisfy science\nby ending as a raving madman.\n\n\"Shorge, my poy,\" were the first words passed by my ears into any\nsuperior part, \"now you let your tongue come--very slowly. Put a good\nsoup at the back of him, then put him in his house quietly, and go to\nshleep again.\"\n\n\"But you haven't finished cooking the partridges yet; and I want to have\nthe one that is over.\"\n\nThis cupidity might scarcely seem to prove the possession of high\nintellect, yet Hopmann declares that the noblest utterance has never\nafforded him so fine a moral. \"Zat Frenchman! Vot he know, to talk so\nquick? No fear for a prain with a memory like zat. Shorge, they kill\nbairds all the year round here. Go to shleep while I cook you four\nbartriches.\"\n\nFor another week he took good care to keep me in a state of body which\nwanted no motion of the mind inside it, nor even any quick heart-action,\nexcept at the sight of a knife and fork. But I feel ashamed to say how\nlong the disabled body was the lord of all, and the nobler elements of\nour existence were not allowed even to speak to it.\n\n\"I have dishpelled his shister and his sweetheart off,\" I heard Dr.\nHopmann say to some one whom I could not see, after he had attended to\nmy straps one day. \"Vot they want? I tell you no. I let you help,\nbecause you not care. His leetle prain stand nothing yet.\"\n\n\"But I do care, because it was all through me,\" the reply was in a sweet\nlow voice, as I caught a glimpse of a fair young lady, dressed in black\nand retiring towards the door; \"you may have got rid of his sister,\ndoctor, but there is one you will never get rid of, so you may just as\nwell give it up. How much longer? And I am sure it would do him good.\nWhy only yesterday I knew----\"\n\n\"Ach, you be off! I am ze master here. We are not in England, where ze\nvimmen rule the roast.\"\n\nThe lady departed hastily, as if she had found that over-true, while the\nGerman bolted the heavy door, and came back with a grin on his solid\nruddy face.\n\n\"Am I never to see any one again,\" I muttered, for gratitude does not\nflourish and abound with a man who has spent two months on his back,\n\"nobody but a confounded German, who bolts everybody out?\"\n\n\"Zat is shoost vot I vant to hear. Shorge, zat proves how you come\nround. If you say, 'Dank you, Tochtor Hopmann, you have saved my life, I\nshall never forget it, how can I ever hope to recompensh you?' then I\nknow that your prain is very weak, not fit for healthy Englishman's at\nall. But when you call him a 'confounded Sherman,' he know, he see, that\nthe nation have come up, which is the most obstinate of nature not to\ndie. All the same, you lie down again. The world go on very well without\nyou, Shorge.\"\n\nIt came into my head that this was not quite right, and that as an\nhonest man I ought to try to stop it; but torpor overpowered my sense of\njustice, as it has a right to do, when the case is not our own. \"I only\nwant to know who that lady was,\" I mumbled.\n\n\"Zat gal was nothing of your concerns,\" Hopmann replied, as he sat down\nby the table, and began to rub some cake tobacco he had sliced; \"little\nEnglish Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein of the name of Pezzeril. Zat bad fe-loe you knock\nworse than they knock you bring her from England with a heap of lies,\nand make sham to marry her; then he throw her off, and drive long black\nstick through her brother, because he haf desire of too moosh money.\nEnglishmans often make mishtakes zat way.\"\n\n\"But I want to know about some one else, somebody different altogether,\nsomebody who never thinks of money----\"\n\n\"Ach zen, what fool can it be? Sometimes leetle gal not think of money;\nbut boys do, vimmen do, men obliged to follow zem.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, doctor! The men set the example. But you know well enough\nwhat I want to know. I want to know where I am, and all about it.\"\n\nThe German came over and looked at me, and turned up one of my eyelids,\nand then did the same to the other, while he blew his smoke over his\nshoulder; and then he said \"No fear. Shorge, you are a brick, and your\nprain go the way to belong to him. One leetle drop I give you shoost to\nclear both ears, and zen I tell you everyzing.\"\n\nO double-dyed villain! With my usual faith, I accepted and made the most\nof his kind offering; and when I awoke again where was he? Perhaps in a\nboat at the mouth of the Rion, listening for the mill-wheels of a\npaddle-steamer to grind the slow grit of distance. For a telegram had\nreached Karthlos that the vegetable Earl, the good Melladew, lay at the\nlast twist of our mortal coil internal, through travail on a bicycle\nwith a County Council lecturer who had taken crab-apples to be\nsynonymous with crabs.\n\nWhen this abandonment was first brought home to me, my behaviour was not\nwhat it should have been. We are all too apt to suppose ourselves\nneglected, and doubly so when the system has been lowered, and the\naction of the heart restricted. To my shame I confess that a miserable\npessimism--such as manhood should scorn on its own behalf, even without\nhigher thoughts to lead it--invaded and began to vanquish me.\n\n\"What is the good of anything? All nature is cruelty; all life a curse.\nEvery one for himself, and for none of us a God. Bitterness, and\ncontempt of mankind, and a reckless fight for one's own hand,--those\nare the only solid things black destiny has left us. There is no choice\nbefore us. As for sense of duty, or the stuff we call honour, or\npatriotism, or the absurdity called love----\"\n\n\"My dear young friend, my directions are precise and I cannot depart\nfrom them. You may talk as much as you like about flowers, or food, or\nsport, or the hills and valleys, or anything in fact that you know\nanything about. And while you do that, you may refresh yourself and grow\nstronger and stronger with these good things here.\" S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, who had\nrisen from behind a curtain, pointed to a table which was laden with\nfine import of exceedingly attractive fragrance. \"On the other hand, if\nyou insist upon wandering into difficult and unpleasant subjects, which\nno man has ever yet made head or tail of, my orders are to anticipate\nthe inevitable injury to the poor head and enfeebled system by prompt\nadministration of these two doses.\" My host laid his hands upon a large\nflat bottle nearly full, but with room below the cork to shake up a\nprofoundity of horrors at the bottom, and a box of pills as big as\nbullets. But before he could approach me, my heart and stomach, and\nevery other organ that can influence opinion underwent a fundamental\nchange.\n\n\"I did not mean it. You must make allowance. Only think of what has been\ndone to me. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, you are not a small minded man. You can see how a\nfellow gets driven to sing out. Emptiness must bear a great deal of the\nblame. I entreat you to look at the matter largely. I am ready to vow\nthat the world is good, and everything contained in it, except--except\nthat bottle, and that box.\"\n\n\"Hasty conversions are not worth much. But from you, George, we accept\nanything. I hope to confirm you in the better faith, with these little\nproofs that the world produces one or two things not entirely bad; and\nafter that, somebody--well, never mind, unless you are inclined to be\namiable.\"\n\nThe chief was now in full Lesghian dress, a very magnificent affair to\nlook at, stately, and graceful, and impressive; but he proved himself\nworthy of apparel even grander, by putting away all disrelishing sights,\nand waiting upon me like a hospital nurse, until I could compass not a\ndainty morsel more, and then he said, \"Shut your eyes, and perhaps you\nwill have a little dream.\"\n\nWas it a little dream? If so, I pray you tell me of a great one.\nExpecting nothing I lay back upon the quiet pillows, quite content, as\nyoung men are--for age destroys that comfort--to fancy that the world is\ngood, and governed by a gentle Lord who waves a hand when we drop our\neyes, that we may try to look up again. When the pride of strength is\ncrushed, and violence of the will lies low, and a man is able to take\nhimself at his proper insignificance, sometimes a little flow of calm\nglides in upon his nature, so that all is soft and bright, and his\nundulations multiply the silver and gold of heaven.\n\nFor behold, as I was gazing with a sweet and tranquil wonder, caring not\nto enquire even where I was, or who I was, but taking as it came to me\nthe good-will of the time, and welcome of the friendly air--behold there\ncame (as it were a vision, not to be enquired into, but accepted with\nthe smiles of sleep) the form and face that had never left me,--though\nnever could I see them clearly,--the presence without which my own\npresentment was all absence.\n\nIt was not for me to be certain yet, played with as I had been by\nvisions that cry advantage of the brain, when even a pennyweight thereof\nis gone; neither was I clear enough to indulge in bright aerial doubt,\nas adolescent genius may. All I knew was \"here I am;\" and nature needed\nno more proof, when I had given myself a substantial pinch. \"Is there\nany one here or there at all?\" I seemed to say, but could not be sure of\nuttering or thinking anything.\n\nThen, as sure as I am sitting here this day, the last thing that ever I\ncould have believed was done concerning me and to me. Dariel came, and I\nknew nothing, except that here was Dariel. I feared to look direct, or\neven glance as if I meant it, being now little more than a lump of\npatches, with gingery tufts among them; and fool enough in my heart to\nthink that love would be ashamed of me. I cannot say another word to\nteach any one who does not know, or do good to one who does. At such a\ntime is there any man, or even any woman, who notices the tint of\ncheeks, the curve of lips, and eyebrows, the guidance of the breath, or\neven the quick and tremulous enquiries, and lingering watches of the\neye? My love was looking at me thus, with a sad and piteous misgiving,\nwhether there might be any hope that I was large of heart as she\nwas,--for now she felt it trembling,--and yet with some cold arm of\npride and maiden fear thrown round it, to hold it back from being\noffered till it had been asked for. And I was looking at my love, with\nnothing but abasement, that anything I had ever done could make her feel\nafraid of me; and yet with some victorious hope that it was because she\nloved me.\n\n\"Yes, I do, I do,\" she said, as if she saw the very thing I wanted to be\nsure of. \"With all my heart I do. But how shall I make you believe it?\nAfter all that I have done, how can you ever believe it?\"\n\nThis made me look about and wonder; for all I wanted was her voice,--to\nlisten to its soft sweet tones, and feel that it was full of kindness,\nand know that it was meant for me; and then to see the smile perhaps\nthat came so often with her words, and never failed to follow them if\never they forgot themselves.\n\n\"You are not to me as you were; you think me of no value now, because I\nhave not been as true, and obstinate of truth against all signs and\nsymptoms and testimony, as an English lady would have been. If you have\nin your mind decided so to estimate me, there is nothing more for me to\nsay. Only that you must not think, because you will not let me show it,\nthat I am base enough not to feel the wonderful things you have done for\nus. For me it is nothing, for I am not worth it; but for my father, and\nmy brother, and for stopping cruel wickedness,--and now they have nearly\nkilled you, so that you do not even know me.\"\n\nShe had tried to make her meaning clear, by keeping herself a good way\noff, and looking at the mountains more than me, and speaking as if her\nwords came one by one from some type-writer; until the thought of my\nmishap and long disablement brought her near. Then I saw how she was\ntrembling, and withdrawing her hands to hide it, and striving to make\nher eyelids proof against the shower inside them. With that the power of\nmy love arose, and I said, \"Dariel, look at me.\"\n\n\"It is impossible any more, after all that I have done.\"\n\nEven while she spoke she did the impossible thing to such effect that I\npartook of the miracle. It seemed to me, as I met that soft deep gaze of\nboundless love and hope, as if Heaven had now so gifted and endowed me\nwith the richest wealth, that humble as my powers were, henceforth I\ncould do anything.\n\n\"I am afraid, I am afraid,\" she whispered, as she saw my joy. \"Love of\nmy heart, it is not right that you should care for me any more. It is\nright for me to love you, and to be your slave for ever. But for you to\nhate me, to hate the Dariel you loved once, because she so requited you.\nHere you have been worse than dead, worse than dead for weeks and weeks,\nafter saving all our lives! Through whom? Through me, that could not\ntrust you, but measured you by my paltry self. But now I know all from\nthat sly traitor who sent the letter to her wicked brother. Alas, how\nwicked I am, too, when he is dead, and she--oh, George, I ought to hate\nher, but I cannot, because of her misfortunes! Tell me, George, do you\nfeel like that? Do you feel that you ought to hate me, because I have\ndestroyed your poor, poor mind?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps I shall, when you have done it. But not till then, my\nDariel. And I think that Dariel owes me something for her compliment to\nmy intellect.\"\n\n\"Hush! My orders are to keep you perfectly quiet and stupid. I like that\nvery much, because it appears so soft and easy. But I must not take\nadvantage,--hush! You want to talk; it is not right.\"\n\nShe laid one sweet soft finger on my lips, and when I closed them,\nobedience had its due reward; such as is well known to those who have\nbeen true and faithful, through every doubt and trouble, to the one they\nlove better than themselves.\n\n\"I am the master now,\" she said, \"and I shall make the love to you, and\nyou will have to put up with it; because you are so helpless, and\nbecause I have robbed you of all chance of doing it to me, when you\ncould. But one thing I shall insist upon,--you must not want to know\nanything about yourself, or even me, or anything that you can think of,\nuntil your poor mind restores itself.\"\n\nThen I said a thing worthy of Tom Erricker, \"I will leave myself in\nDariel's hands, if she will take me into her arms sometimes.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nBeing so treated I should have shamed England among races who think well\nof her, if I had allowed a mere knock on the head to dwell too much upon\nmy mind. Strogue came to look at me, and spoke with his usual lofty\nconfidence.\n\n\"My son, you have done well and wisely. I fell among a tribe on the\nborders of Thibet, who make a point of taking out a piece about the size\nof half a crown from the skull of every strong male infant. The folly of\nthe earth goes out, and the wisdom of the air comes in, according to\ntheir traditions. But I was not allowed to verify their views, and I\nfound more vigour than wisdom there, for they kicked me over their\nborder. But you may hope the best. Who knows? You may begin to say\nsomething good at last, and we shall know how you got it.\"\n\nThis was all very well for him, who had not received a single scratch,\nand was living now in clover. Let good friends try things for\nthemselves, and comfort us with their own distress. \"Optimism\" is a\nlovely gift, and comes direct from Heaven, chiefly when the sun shines\non ourselves. But Strogue never listened to argument. \"You are the\nluckiest fellow,\" he proceeded, \"that I have ever come across. Here you\nhave had your sister crying over you for days and days, putting her\nhusband on the shelf, although he is made of money; and then the best\ndoctor in the world, the only one that ever did any good; and now you\nhave the loveliest girl ever seen waiting upon you hand and foot; and\nmore than all without a bit of pain, without even knowing it, you are\nmade a wise man for the rest of your life, at the age of six-and-twenty.\nStop out here, my boy, stop out here. Your father will have heaps of\nmoney now, from your brother's grand discovery. S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar has made up his\nmind to keep 'Farmer George' for the coffee-growing; you can shoot all\nsorts of mountain game, and people the Terek and the Kur with salmon,\nand winter at Tiflis or Patigorsk.\"\n\nAs yet I was not in a clear condition to care where I was, or even to\nenquire at all about it, so long as the one my whole heart looked for\ncame for it to dwell with every day. But gradually (I know not how, and\nprobably none can tell me) a power, almost as strong as love of the\nfinest and sweetest of our kind, began to grow in my heavy nature.\nEverything is now explained, even when a man knocks his brother on the\nhead, as a piece of hereditary tendency. To enter that plea appears to\nme to cast an ungraceful reproach upon those who have gone before us and\ndone their best according to their lights which we disparage, and\nwithout receiving any credit for the wonderful goodness we derive from\nthem. Let me blame no one but myself for that unreasonable pining and\nhankering for my native land.\n\n\"Look at the glory of the sky, look at the mountains and the woods,\"\nseveral people said to me, who never looked twice at them when they\ncould smell their dinner; \"look at the grand peaks robed with snow! Can\nyou see anything like that in England?\"\n\n\"No. But I can feel the things I see there,\" I used to answer meekly;\n\"there may be little grandeur in them, but I love the things I know.\"\n\nMoreover it came into my jarred and worried mind, that the gentle\nsatisfaction--the only solid form ever taken by human happiness--is\nseldom or perhaps never to be found, when nature is too great around us.\nWe see perpetual change of form and colour, and a fleeting majesty, and\npossibly our puny selves are incited to hopeless rivalry. Or even if\nthere be nought in that, the sense of danger and wild elements and\npowers altogether beyond our control is at enmity with placid thought\nand the quiet course of duties; so that it is a sweeter thing, at any\nrate for an Englishman, to watch the plough on a gentle slope, or the\ncows in a meadow with their hind legs spread ready for the milking-pail,\nor the harvest-waggon coming to the rick, than to gaze at all the rugged\ngrandeur of the Alps or Caucasus.\n\n\"My dear friend,\" S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar said, when I tried to make him see it so,\n\"you were not born here, but I was; and that makes all the difference. I\nsee no more of majesty, or menace, or sublime oppression, when I look at\na peak growing up against the sky, than you find in a tall poplar-tree.\nAnd behold how calm is your Captain Strogue, a man of the world, who\ntakes nothing amiss.\"\n\n\"Because he has no strict sense of right. He will do what he thinks\nhonourable, which every man judges by his own side-lights. Forgive me,\nS\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, for speaking so. You have your own standard, and you keep to\nit; and it is as much higher than mine, as Kazbek is than a Surrey\nhill.\"\n\n\"There you are wrong,\" he answered gently; \"the proof is always in the\npractice. And I am proving myself as selfish, and as thoroughly\nungrateful, as if I had always been prosperous. George, you know too\nwell what I mean. Through you alone, and your wonderful\"--it would not\nbecome me to repeat all he said--\"I now have not only my life and my\nrights, but also a very grand son of my own, whose nature is that of the\nsweet one I destroyed; and soon he will help me in the work I hope to\ndo. Yet I am so mean and small, that I grudge you the one love of your\nlife, if you insist upon taking her away.\"\n\nFor a moment, as I looked at him, and perceived the sparkle of tears in\nhis eyes, although his voice was clear and firm, it came home to my\nheart that here was a contest of generosity, wherein it would be ignoble\nof me not to show some valiance. But a sense of yearning, and perpetual\nloneliness, and an empty life, coupled with a doubt of my duty to the\nPower which has ordained true love, proved too much for my nobility.\n\n\"If you really think, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar,\" I began with a dismal voice, \"if you\ncan reconcile it with your duty as a father to keep your dear child all\nto yourself--for she has vowed, I may tell you that, fifty times she has\npledged herself never to have any one but me--and of course I know that\nI am poor.\" This was very mean of me, and I never meant to say it; but\nlove is mean, as well as grand.\n\n\"Then let us settle it this way,\" he answered, with a proud paternal\nsmile: \"I have been so long in England that I will follow English\nusages. Let us leave it to the lady. I will send for Dariel, and she\nshall choose between us.\"\n\n\"I pray you not. It would be such a pain and trial to her.\"\n\nAs I spoke, he looked at me with a warmth of true affection.\n\n\"George, you love her even more than her own father does,\" he said;\n\"you deserve a decision in your favour. But I doubt whether you will get\nit. If you do, I resign without conditions. But poverty there need be\nnone, unless you insist upon it. Mr. Stoneman, your brother-in-law,\nentreats me to accept \u00c2\u00a310,000 for the valley of St. Winifred. Three\nrailway companies there are, according to his account of it, railing and\nraving at one another for the possession of that part of Surrey. They\nall declare that such a line can never pay for making, but they would\nspend their last shilling upon it, rather than see either of the others\nthere. Mr. Stoneman is in what you call the bench, the chair, the throne\nof the wealthiest of the three; and if he can make purchase of that\ntrack, the rivals will have no chance to pass. I have felt much scruple\nabout accepting so much for land that cost me so little; the justice of\nthe matter is not clear to me as a stranger to the English equity.\"\n\n\"Oh, S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar,\" I exclaimed with great surprise, \"the largest and\nnoblest of all the Angels, if he got the whip-hand of a Railway Company,\nwould be compelled by self-respect to take it out of them, to their last\npenny.\"\n\n\"So I have been told on every side,\" the Lesghian chief replied with\ncalm decision; \"but I waited for you to confirm it, George. I perceive\nthat they are the civilised form of the bandit. Well, that sum which\nseems considerable to us, though in England you think nothing of it,\nwill pass at once to my Dariel, as the strict justice of the case\ndemands. Of that she knows nothing, and if she knew it, her decision\nwould be just the same. But here she comes, as I arranged.\"\n\nThe chief window of the sitting-room to which I was now promoted faced\nwestward over the table-rock on which the great house stood; and further\nto the west, beyond deep chasms and dark precipices, arose a mighty Tau,\nthe rival of Kazbek in this eastern range, and mantled with perpetual\nsnow. This being flushed with ruddy thrills from the glances of the\nevening sun shed a rich tint through the room, as if the rugged\nmountains vied with heaven to bring their sweet Princess a tribute of\nbright roses. Then as she passed the black walnut panels, which looked\nas old as the ark itself, I took it for a good omen that she wore a\ndress which I had praised; not such a thing as we see here, but\ngraceful, elegant, flowing softly, docile, ductile, and yet expressive,\nsimple though full of harmonious contrasts, zealous--if there were any\nhope of that--to enhance the beauty it contained, as a great poet's\nthoughts are clothed sometimes in language that transcends themselves.\n\nShe glanced at me as I rose, for now I could stand once more without\ngiddiness, and by that passing glance she told me that she knew the time\nwas come, when her long choice must be made. Then she went on to her\nfather's side, and took both his hands and looked at him, as if there\nwas nobody else to look at.\n\nOver her bowed head he gave me a smile, which I interpreted--\"Behold the\nvanity of human wishes! Be satisfied with Nature's laws. A dear child\nloves her father best. Young men may long to rob him; but the Lord\nforbids it. I grieve for you. But how could it be otherwise?\"\n\nThere was nothing more for me to say. I made the best bow of which a\ntrue-born British back is capable; and with all the dignity left in me\nby the beating of my foolish heart, I walked away from both of them\ntowards a little door which opened on a quiet gallery, where I might sit\ndown and think it over with myself alone.\n\nBut before I could turn the handle, trembling arms were round my neck,\nand a quivering breast arose to mine, and a face that shone with rolling\ntears looked up for me to comfort it, and sweet lips whispered close to\nmine--\"My love, could you believe it?\"\n\nThen I felt myself all right again. The strength that had been shattered\nby big Osset clubs, and long prostration, lonely wanderings of bloodless\nbrain, feeble doubts of woman's truth, and the crush of furious doctors,\nall flowed back, and filled my heart and life with the joy of this great\nlove.\n\nI led his beautiful daughter back to S\u00c3\u00bbr Imar, and I said--\"You see.\"\n\n\"Yes, I see,\" he answered softly. \"And there is no more to be said.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"_'Yes, I see,' he answered softly._\"]\n\n\nPRINTED BY WILLIAM BLACKWOOD AND SONS.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Dariel, by R.

To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":36,"split":"train"}
