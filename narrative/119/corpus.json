{"ori_id":"1a26b476901a0785835b0ebeecaae3a212b026ef","title":"Orley Farm (novel)","context":"Orley Farm (novel)\n When Joseph Mason of Groby Park, Yorkshire, died, he left his estate to his family. A codicil to his will, however, left Orley Farm (near London) to his much younger second wife and infant son. The will and the codicil were in her handwriting, and there were three witnesses, one of whom was no longer alive. A bitterly fought court case confirmed the codicil.\nTwenty years pass. Lady Mason lives at Orley Farm with her adult son, Lucius. Samuel Dockwrath, a tenant, is asked to leave by Lucius, who wants to try new intensive farming methods. Aggrieved, and knowing of the original case (John Kenneby, one of the codicil witnesses, had been an unsuccessful suitor of his wife Miriam Usbech), Dockwrath investigates and finds a second deed signed by the same witnesses on the same date, though they can remember signing only one. He travels to Groby Park in Yorkshire, where Joseph Mason the younger lives with his comically parsimonious wife, and persuades Mason to have Lady Mason prosecuted for forgery. The prosecution fails, but Lady Mason later confesses privately that she committed the forgery, and is prompted by conscience to give up the estate.\nThere are various subplots. The main one deals with a slowly unfolding romance between Felix Graham (a young and relatively poor barrister without family) and Madeline Staveley, daughter of Judge Stavely of Noningsby. Graham has a long-standing engagement to the penniless Mary Snow, whom he supports and educates while she is being \"moulded\" to be his wife.\nBetween the Staveleys at Alston and Orley Farm at Hamworth lies the Cleve, where Sir Peregrine Orme lives with his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Orme, and grandson, Peregrine. Sir Peregrine falls in love with Lady Mason and is briefly engaged to her, but she calls off the match when she realises the seriousness of the court case.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Furnival, another barrister, befriends Lady Mason, arousing the jealousy of his wife. His daughter, Sophia, has a brief relationship with Augustus Stavely and a brief engagement to Lucius Mason. Eventually Furnival and his wife are reconciled, and Sophia's engagement is dropped. Sophia is portrayed as an intelligent woman who writes comically skilful letters.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Orley Farm, by Anthony Trollope\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

CHAPTER LXXIX\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME I.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHE COMMENCEMENT OF THE GREAT ORLEY FARM CASE.\n\n\nIt is not true that a rose by any other name will smell as sweet.\nWere it true, I should call this story \"The Great Orley Farm Case.\"\nBut who would ask for the ninth number of a serial work burthened\nwith so very uncouth an appellation? Thence, and therefore,--Orley\nFarm.\n\nI say so much at commencing in order that I may have an opportunity\nof explaining that this book of mine will not be devoted in any\nspecial way to rural delights. The name might lead to the idea that\nnew precepts were to be given, in the pleasant guise of a novel, as\nto cream-cheeses, pigs with small bones, wheat sown in drills, or\nartificial manure. No such aspirations are mine. I make no attempts\nin that line, and declare at once that agriculturists will gain\nnothing from my present performance. Orley Farm, my readers, will be\nour scene during a portion of our present sojourn together, but the\nname has been chosen as having been intimately connected with certain\nlegal questions which made a considerable stir in our courts of law.\n\nIt was twenty years before the date at which this story will be\nsupposed to commence that the name of Orley Farm first became known\nto the wearers of the long robe. At that time had died an old\ngentleman, Sir Joseph Mason, who left behind him a landed estate in\nYorkshire of considerable extent and value. This he bequeathed, in a\nproper way, to his eldest son, the Joseph Mason, Esq., of our date.\nSir Joseph had been a London merchant; had made his own money, having\ncommenced the world, no doubt, with half a crown; had become, in\nturn, alderman, mayor, and knight; and in the fulness of time was\ngathered to his fathers. He had purchased this estate in Yorkshire\nlate in life--we may as well become acquainted with the name, Groby\nPark--and his eldest son had lived there with such enjoyment of the\nprivileges of an English country gentleman as he had been able to\nmaster for himself. Sir Joseph had also had three daughters, full\nsisters of Joseph of Groby, whom he endowed sufficiently and gave\nover to three respective loving husbands. And then shortly before his\ndeath, three years or so, Sir Joseph had married a second wife, a\nlady forty-five years his junior, and by her he also left one son, an\ninfant only two years old when he died.\n\nFor many years this prosperous gentleman had lived at a small country\nhouse, some five-and-twenty miles from London, called Orley Farm.\nThis had been his first purchase of land, and he had never given up\nhis residence there, although his wealth would have entitled him to\nthe enjoyment of a larger establishment. On the birth of his youngest\nson, at which time his eldest was nearly forty years old, he made\ncertain moderate provision for the infant, as he had already made\nmoderate provision for his young wife; but it was then clearly\nunderstood by the eldest son that Orley Farm was to go with the Groby\nPark estate to him as the heir. When, however, Sir Joseph died, a\ncodicil to his will, executed with due legal formalities, bequeathed\nOrley Farm to his youngest son, little Lucius Mason.\n\nThen commenced those legal proceedings which at last developed\nthemselves into the great Orley Farm Case. The eldest son contested\nthe validity of the codicil; and indeed there were some grounds\non which it appeared feasible that he should do so. This codicil\nnot only left Orley Farm away from him to baby Lucius, but also\ninterfered in another respect with the previous will. It devised a\nsum of two thousand pounds to a certain Miriam Usbech, the daughter\nof one Jonathan Usbech who was himself the attorney who had attended\nupon Sir Joseph for the making out of this very will, and also of\nthis very codicil. This sum of two thousand pounds was not, it is\ntrue, left away from the surviving Joseph, but was to be produced out\nof certain personal property which had been left by the first will to\nthe widow. And then old Jonathan Usbech had died, while Sir Joseph\nMason was still living.\n\nAll the circumstances of the trial need not be detailed here. It was\nclearly proved that Sir Joseph had during his whole life expressed\nhis intention of leaving Orley Farm to his eldest son; that he was a\nman void of mystery, and not given to secrets in his money matters,\nand one very little likely to change his opinion on such subjects. It\nwas proved that old Jonathan Usbech at the time in which the will was\nmade was in very bad circumstances, both as regards money and health.\nHis business had once not been bad, but he had eaten and drunk it,\nand at this period was feeble and penniless, overwhelmed both by gout\nand debt. He had for many years been much employed by Sir Joseph in\nmoney matters, and it was known that he was so employed almost up to\nthe day of his death. The question was whether he had been employed\nto make this codicil.\n\nThe body of the will was in the handwriting of the widow, as was also\nthe codicil. It was stated by her at the trial that the words were\ndictated to her by Usbech in her husband's hearing, and that the\ndocument was then signed by her husband in the presence of them both,\nand also in the presence of two other persons--a young man employed\nby her husband as a clerk, and by a servant-maid. These two last,\ntogether with Mr. Usbech, were the three witnesses whose names\nappeared in the codicil. There had been no secrets between Lady Mason\nand her husband as to his will. She had always, she said, endeavoured\nto induce him to leave Orley Farm to her child from the day of the\nchild's birth, and had at last succeeded. In agreeing to this Sir\nJoseph had explained to her, somewhat angrily, that he wished to\nprovide for Usbech's daughter, and that now he would do so out of\nmoneys previously intended for her, the widow, and not out of the\nestate which would go to his eldest son. To this she had assented\nwithout a word, and had written the codicil in accordance with the\nlawyer's dictation, he, the lawyer, suffering at the time from gout\nin his hand. Among other things Lady Mason proved that on the date of\nthe signatures Mr. Usbech had been with Sir Joseph for sundry hours.\n\nThen the young clerk was examined. He had, he said, witnessed in\nhis time four, ten, twenty, and, under pressure, he confessed to\nas many as a hundred and twenty business signatures on the part of\nhis employer, Sir Joseph. He thought he had witnessed a hundred\nand twenty, but would take his oath he had not witnessed a hundred\nand twenty-one. He did remember witnessing a signature of his\nmaster about the time specified by the date of the codicil, and he\nremembered the maid-servant also signing at the same time. Mr. Usbech\nwas then present; but he did not remember Mr. Usbech having the\npen in his hand. Mr. Usbech, he knew, could not write at that time,\nbecause of the gout; but he might, no doubt, have written as much\nas his own name. He swore to both the signatures--his own and his\nmaster's; and in cross-examination swore that he thought it probable\nthat they might be forgeries. On re-examination he was confident that\nhis own name, as there appearing, had been written by himself; but\non re-cross-examination, he felt sure that there was something wrong.\nIt ended in the judge informing him that his word was worth nothing,\nwhich was hard enough on the poor young man, seeing that he had done\nhis best to tell all that he remembered. Then the servant-girl came\ninto the witness-box. She was sure it was her own handwriting. She\nremembered being called in to write her name, and seeing the master\nwrite his. It had all been explained to her at the time, but she\nadmitted that she had not understood the explanation. She had also\nseen the clerk write his name, but she was not sure that she had seen\nMr. Usbech write. Mr. Usbech had had a pen in his hand; she was sure\nof that.\n\nThe last witness was Miriam Usbech, then a very pretty, simple girl\nof seventeen. Her father had told her once that he hoped Sir Joseph\nwould make provision for her. This had been shortly before her\nfather's death. At her father's death she had been sent for to Orley\nFarm, and had remained there till Sir Joseph died. She had always\nregarded Sir Joseph and Lady Mason as her best friends. She had known\nSir Joseph all her life, and did not think it unnatural that he\nshould provide for her. She had heard her father say more than once\nthat Lady Mason would never rest till the old gentleman had settled\nOrley Farm upon her son.\n\nNot half the evidence taken has been given here, but enough probably\nfor our purposes. The will and codicil were confirmed, and Lady Mason\ncontinued to live at the farm. Her evidence was supposed to have been\nexcellently given, and to have been conclusive. She had seen the\nsignature, and written the codicil, and could explain the motive. She\nwas a woman of high character, of great talent, and of repute in the\nneighbourhood; and, as the judge remarked, there could be no possible\nreason for doubting her word. Nothing also could be simpler or\nprettier than the evidence of Miriam Usbech, as to whose fate and\ndestiny people at the time expressed much sympathy. That stupid young\nclerk was responsible for the only weak part of the matter; but if\nhe proved nothing on one side, neither did he prove anything on the\nother.\n\nThis was the commencement of the great Orley Farm Case, and having\nbeen then decided in favour of the infant it was allowed to slumber\nfor nearly twenty years. The codicil was confirmed, and Lady Mason\nremained undisturbed in possession of the house, acting as guardian\nfor her child till he came of age, and indeed for some time beyond\nthat epoch. In the course of a page or two I shall beg my readers to\nallow me to introduce this lady to their acquaintance.\n\nMiriam Usbech, of whom also we shall see something, remained at the\nfarm under Lady Mason's care till she married a young attorney, who\nin process of time succeeded to such business as her father left\nbehind him. She suffered some troubles in life before she settled\ndown in the neighbouring country town as Mrs. Dockwrath, for she had\nhad another lover, the stupid young clerk who had so villainously\nbroken down in his evidence; and to this other lover, whom she had\nbeen unable to bring herself to accept, Lady Mason had given her\nfavour and assistance. Poor Miriam was at that time a soft, mild-eyed\ngirl, easy to be led, one would have said; but in this matter Lady\nMason could not lead her. It was in vain to tell her that the\ncharacter of young Dockwrath did not stand high, and that young\nKenneby, the clerk, should be promoted to all manner of good things.\nSoft and mild-eyed as Miriam was, Love was still the lord of all. In\nthis matter she would not be persuaded; and eventually she gave her\ntwo thousand pounds to Samuel Dockwrath, the young attorney with the\nquestionable character.\n\nThis led to no breach between her and her patroness. Lady Mason,\nwishing to do the best for her young friend, had favoured John\nKenneby, but she was not a woman at all likely to quarrel on such a\nground as this. \"Well, Miriam,\" she had said, \"you must judge for\nyourself, of course, in such a matter as this. You know my regard for\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, ma'am,\" said Miriam, eagerly.\n\n\"And I shall always be glad to promote your welfare as Mrs.\nDockwrath, if possible. I can only say that I should have had more\nsatisfaction in attempting to do so for you as Mrs. Kenneby.\" But,\nin spite of the seeming coldness of these words, Lady Mason had\nbeen constant to her friend for many years, and had attended to her\nwith more or less active kindness in all the sorrows arising from\nan annual baby and two sets of twins--a progeny which before the\ncommencement of my tale reached the serious number of sixteen, all\nliving.\n\nAmong other solid benefits conferred by Lady Mason had been the\nletting to Mr. Dockwrath of certain two fields, lying at the\nextremity of the farm property, and quite adjacent to the town of\nHamworth in which old Mr. Usbech had resided. These had been let by\nthe year, at a rent not considered to be too high at that period, and\nwhich had certainly become much lower in proportion to the value of\nthe land, as the town of Hamworth had increased. On these fields Mr.\nDockwrath expended some money, though probably not so much as he\naverred; and when noticed to give them up at the period of young\nMason's coming of age, expressed himself terribly aggrieved.\n\n\"Surely, Mr. Dockwrath, you are very ungrateful,\" Lady Mason had said\nto him. But he had answered her with disrespectful words; and hence\nhad arisen an actual breach between her and poor Miriam's husband. \"I\nmust say, Miriam, that Mr. Dockwrath is unreasonable,\" Lady Mason had\nsaid. And what could a poor wife answer? \"Oh! Lady Mason, pray let\nit bide a time till it all comes right.\" But it never did come right;\nand the affair of those two fields created the great Orley Farm Case,\nwhich it will be our business to unravel.\n\nAnd now a word or two as to this Orley Farm. In the first place let\nit be understood that the estate consisted of two farms. One, called\nthe Old Farm, was let to an old farmer named Greenwood, and had been\nlet to him and to his father for many years antecedent to the days\nof the Masons. Mr. Greenwood held about three hundred acres of land,\npaying with admirable punctuality over four hundred a year in rent,\nand was regarded by all the Orley people as an institution on the\nproperty. Then there was the farm-house and the land attached to it.\nThis was the residence in which Sir Joseph had lived, keeping in\nhis own hands this portion of the property. When first inhabited by\nhim the house was not fitted for more than the requirements of an\nordinary farmer, but he had gradually added to it and ornamented\nit till it was commodious, irregular, picturesque, and straggling.\nWhen he died, and during the occupation of his widow, it consisted\nof three buildings of various heights, attached to each other,\nand standing in a row. The lower contained a large kitchen, which\nhad been the living-room of the farm-house, and was surrounded\nby bake-house, laundry, dairy, and servants' room, all of fair\ndimensions. It was two stories high, but the rooms were low, and the\nroof steep and covered with tiles. The next portion had been added by\nSir Joseph, then Mr. Mason, when he first thought of living at the\nplace. This also was tiled, and the rooms were nearly as low; but\nthere were three stories, and the building therefore was considerably\nhigher. For five-and-twenty years the farm-house, so arranged, had\nsufficed for the common wants of Sir Joseph and his family; but when\nhe determined to give up his establishment in the City, he added on\nanother step to the house at Orley Farm. On this occasion he built\na good dining-room, with a drawing-room over it, and bed-room over\nthat; and this portion of the edifice was slated.\n\nThe whole stood in one line fronting on to a large lawn which fell\nsteeply away from the house into an orchard at the bottom. This\nlawn was cut in terraces, and here and there upon it there stood\napple-trees of ancient growth; for here had been the garden of the\nold farm-house. They were large, straggling trees, such as do not\ndelight the eyes of modern gardeners; but they produced fruit by the\nbushel, very sweet to the palate, though probably not so perfectly\nround, and large, and handsome as those which the horticultural skill\nof the present day requires. The face of the house from one end to\nthe other was covered with vines and passion-flowers, for the aspect\nwas due south; and as the whole of the later addition was faced by\na verandah, which also, as regarded the ground-floor, ran along the\nmiddle building, the place in summer was pretty enough. As I have\nsaid before, it was irregular and straggling, but at the same time\nroomy and picturesque. Such was Orley Farm-house.\n\nThere were about two hundred acres of land attached to it, together\nwith a large old-fashioned farm-yard, standing not so far from the\nhouse as most gentlemen farmers might perhaps desire. The farm\nbuildings, however, were well hidden, for Sir Joseph, though he would\nat no time go to the expense of constructing all anew, had spent more\nmoney than such a proceeding would have cost him doctoring existing\nevils and ornamenting the standing edifices. In doing this he had\nextended the walls of a brewhouse, and covered them with creepers, so\nas to shut out from the hall door the approach to the farm-yard, and\nhad put up a quarter of a mile of high ornamental paling for the same\npurpose. He had planted an extensive shrubbery along the brow of the\nhill at one side of the house, had built summer-houses, and sunk a\nha-ha fence below the orchard, and had contrived to give to the place\nthe unmistakable appearance of an English gentleman's country-house.\nNevertheless, Sir Joseph had never bestowed upon his estate, nor had\nit ever deserved, a more grandiloquent name than that which it had\npossessed of old.\n\nOrley Farm-house itself is somewhat more than a mile distant from\nthe town of Hamworth, but the land runs in the direction of the\ntown, not skirting the high road, but stretching behind the cottages\nwhich stand along the pathway; and it terminates in those two fields\nrespecting which Mr. Dockwrath the attorney became so irrationally\nangry at the period of which we are now immediately about to treat.\nThese fields lie on the steep slope of Hamworth Hill, and through\nthem runs the public path from the hamlet of Roxeth up to Hamworth\nchurch; for, as all the world knows, Hamworth church stands high, and\nis a landmark to the world for miles and miles around.\n\nWithin a circuit of thirty miles from London no land lies more\nbeautifully circumstanced with regard to scenery than the country\nabout Hamworth; and its most perfect loveliness commences just\nbeyond the slopes of Orley Farm. There is a little village called\nColdharbour, consisting of some half-dozen cottages, situated\nimmediately outside Lady Mason's gate,--and it may as well be stated\nhere that this gate is but three hundred yards from the house, and is\nguarded by no lodge. This village stands at the foot of Cleeve Hill.\nThe land hereabouts ceases to be fertile, and breaks away into heath\nand common ground. Round the foot of the hill there are extensive\nwoods, all of which belong to Sir Peregrine Orme, the lord of the\nmanor. Sir Peregrine is not a rich man, not rich, that is, it being\nborne in mind that he is a baronet, that he represented his county in\nparliament for three or four sessions, and that his ancestors have\nowned The Cleeve estate for the last four hundred years; but he is by\ngeneral repute the greatest man in these parts. We may expect to hear\nmore of him also as the story makes its way.\n\nI know many spots in England and in other lands, world-famous in\nregard to scenery, which to my eyes are hardly equal to Cleeve Hill.\nFrom the top of it you are told that you may see into seven counties;\nbut to me that privilege never possessed any value. I should not\ncare to see into seventeen counties, unless the country which spread\nitself before my view was fair and lovely. The country which is so\nseen from Cleeve Hill is exquisitely fair and lovely;--very fair,\nwith glorious fields of unsurpassed fertility, and lovely with oak\nwoods and brown open heaths which stretch away, hill after hill, down\ntowards the southern coast. I could greedily fill a long chapter with\nthe well-loved glories of Cleeve Hill; but it may be that we must\npress its heather with our feet more than once in the course of our\npresent task, and if so, it will be well to leave something for those\ncoming visits.\n\n\"Ungrateful! I'll let her know whether I owe her any gratitude.\nHaven't I paid her her rent every half-year as it came due? what more\nwould she have? Ungrateful, indeed! She is one of those women who\nthink that you ought to go down on your knees to them if they only\nspeak civilly to you. I'll let her know whether I'm ungrateful.\"\n\nThese words were spoken by angry Mr. Samuel Dockwrath to his wife, as\nhe stood up before his parlour-fire after breakfast, and the woman to\nwhom he referred was Lady Mason. Mr. Samuel Dockwrath was very angry\nas he so spoke, or at any rate he seemed to be so. There are men who\ntake a delight in abusing those special friends whom their wives\nbest love, and Mr. Dockwrath was one of these. He had never given\nhis cordial consent to the intercourse which had hitherto existed\nbetween the lady of Orley Farm and his household, although he had not\ndeclined the substantial benefits which had accompanied it. His pride\nhad rebelled against the feeling of patronage, though his interest\nhad submitted to the advantages thence derived. A family of sixteen\nchildren is a heavy burden for a country attorney with a small\npractice, even though his wife may have had a fortune of two thousand\npounds; and thus Mr. Dockwrath, though he had never himself loved\nLady Mason, had permitted his wife to accept all those numberless\nkindnesses which a lady with comfortable means and no children is\nalways able to bestow on a favoured neighbour who has few means and\nmany children. Indeed, he himself had accepted a great favour with\nreference to the holding of those two fields, and had acknowledged as\nmuch when first he took them into his hands some sixteen or seventeen\nyears back. But all that was forgotten now; and having held them for\nso long a period, he bitterly felt the loss, and resolved that it\nwould ill become him as a man and an attorney to allow so deep an\ninjury to pass unnoticed. It may be, moreover, that Mr. Dockwrath was\nnow doing somewhat better in the world than formerly, and that he\ncould afford to give up Lady Mason, and to demand also that his wife\nshould give her up. Those trumpery presents from Orley Farm were very\nwell while he was struggling for bare bread, but now, now that he had\nturned the corner,--now that by his divine art and mystery of law\nhe had managed to become master of that beautiful result of British\nperseverance, a balance at his banker's, he could afford to indulge\nhis natural antipathy to a lady who had endeavoured in early life\nto divert from him the little fortune which had started him in the\nworld.\n\nMiriam Dockwrath, as she sat on this morning, listening to her\nhusband's anger, with a sick little girl on her knee, and four or\nfive others clustering round her, half covered with their matutinal\nbread and milk, was mild-eyed and soft as ever. Hers was a nature in\nwhich softness would ever prevail;--softness, and that tenderness of\nheart, always leaning, and sometimes almost crouching, of which a\nmild eye is the outward sign. But her comeliness and prettiness were\ngone. Female beauty of the sterner, grander sort may support the\nburden of sixteen children, all living,--and still survive. I have\nknown it to do so, and to survive with much of its youthful glory.\nBut that mild-eyed, soft, round, plumpy prettiness gives way beneath\nsuch a weight as that: years alone tell on it quickly; but children\nand limited means combined with years leave to it hardly a chance.\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very sorry,\" said the poor woman, worn with her many\ncares.\n\n\"Sorry; yes, and I'll make her sorry, the proud minx. There's an old\nsaying, that those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.\"\n\n\"But, Samuel, I don't think she means to be doing you any harm. You\nknow she always did say-- Don't, Bessy; how can you put your fingers\ninto the basin in that way?\"\n\n\"Sam has taken my spoon away, mamma.\"\n\n\"I'll let her know whether she's doing any harm or no. And what\nsignifies what was said sixteen years ago? Has she anything to show\nin writing? As far as I know, nothing of the kind was said.\"\n\n\"Oh, I remember it, Samuel; I do indeed!\"\n\n\"Let me tell you then that you had better not try to remember\nanything about it. If you ain't quiet, Bob, I'll make you, pretty\nquick; d'ye hear that? The fact is, your memory is not worth a curse.\nWhere are you to get milk for all those children, do you think, when\nthe fields are gone?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very sorry, Samuel.\"\n\n\"Sorry; yes, and somebody else shall be sorry too. And look here,\nMiriam, I won't have you going up to Orley Farm on any pretence\nwhatever; do you hear that?\" and then, having given that imperative\ncommand to his wife and slave, the lord and master of that\nestablishment walked forth into his office.\n\nOn the whole Miriam Usbech might have done better had she followed\nthe advice of her patroness in early life, and married the stupid\nclerk.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nLADY MASON AND HER SON.\n\n\nI trust that it is already perceived by all persistent novel readers\nthat very much of the interest of this tale will be centred in the\nperson of Lady Mason. Such educated persons, however, will probably\nbe aware that she is not intended to be the heroine. The heroine, so\ncalled, must by a certain fixed law be young and marriageable. Some\nsuch heroine in some future number shall be forthcoming, with as\nmuch of the heroic about her as may be found convenient; but for the\npresent let it be understood that the person and character of Lady\nMason is as important to us as can be those of any young lady, let\nher be ever so gracious or ever so beautiful.\n\nIn giving the details of her history, I do not know that I need go\nback beyond her grandfather and grandmother, who were thoroughly\nrespectable people in the hardware line; I speak of those relatives\nby the father's side. Her own parents had risen in the world,--had\nrisen from retail to wholesale, and considered themselves for a\nlong period of years to be good representatives of the commercial\nenergy and prosperity of Great Britain. But a fall had come upon\nthem,--as a fall does come very often to our excellent commercial\nrepresentatives--and Mr. Johnson was in the \"Gazette.\" It would be\nlong to tell how old Sir Joseph Mason was concerned in these affairs,\nhow he acted as the principal assignee, and how ultimately he took\nto his bosom as his portion of the assets of the estate, young Mary\nJohnson, and made her his wife and mistress of Orley Farm. Of the\nfamily of the Johnsons there were but three others, the father, the\nmother, and a brother. The father did not survive the disgrace of his\nbankruptcy, and the mother in process of time settled herself with\nher son in one of the Lancashire manufacturing towns, where John\nJohnson raised his head in business to some moderate altitude, Sir\nJoseph having afforded much valuable assistance. There for the\npresent we will leave them.\n\nI do not think that Sir Joseph ever repented of the perilous deed he\ndid in marrying that young wife. His home for many years had been\ndesolate and solitary; his children had gone from him, and did not\ncome to visit him very frequently in his poor home at the farm. They\nhad become grander people than him, had been gifted with aspiring\nminds, and in every turn and twist which they took, looked to do\nsomething towards washing themselves clean from the dirt of the\ncounting-house. This was specially the case with Sir Joseph's son, to\nwhom the father had made over lands and money sufficient to enable\nhim to come before the world as a country gentleman with a coat of\narms on his coach-panel. It would be inconvenient for us to run off\nto Groby Park at the present moment, and I will therefore say no more\njust now as to Joseph junior, but will explain that Joseph senior was\nnot made angry by this neglect. He was a grave, quiet, rational man,\nnot however devoid of some folly; as indeed what rational man is so\ndevoid? He was burdened with an ambition to establish a family as the\nresult of his success in life; and having put forth his son into the\nworld with these views, was content that that son should act upon\nthem persistently. Joseph Mason, Esq., of Groby Park, in Yorkshire,\nwas now a county magistrate, and had made some way towards a footing\nin the county society around him. With these hopes, and ambition such\nas this, it was probably not expedient that he should spend much of\nhis time at Orley Farm. The three daughters were circumstanced much\nin the same way: they had all married gentlemen, and were bent on\nrising in the world; moreover, the steadfast resolution of purpose\nwhich characterised their father was known by them all,--and by\ntheir husbands: they had received their fortunes, with some settled\ncontingencies to be forthcoming on their father's demise; why, then,\ntrouble the old gentleman at Orley Farm?\n\nUnder such circumstances the old gentleman married his young\nwife,--to the great disgust of his four children. They of course\ndeclared to each other, corresponding among themselves by letter,\nthat the old gentleman had positively disgraced himself. It was\nimpossible that they should make any visits whatever to Orley Farm\nwhile such a mistress of the house was there;--and the daughters did\nmake no such visits. Joseph, the son, whose monetary connection with\nhis father was as yet by no means fixed and settled in its nature,\ndid make one such visit, and then received his father's assurance--so\nat least he afterwards said and swore--that this marriage should by\nno means interfere with the expected inheritance of the Orley Farm\nacres. But at that time no young son had been born,--nor, probably,\nwas any such young son expected.\n\nThe farm-house became a much brighter abode for the old man, for the\nfew years which were left to him, after he had brought his young\nwife home. She was quiet, sensible, clever, and unremitting in her\nattention. She burthened him with no requests for gay society, and\ntook his home as she found it, making the best of it for herself, and\nmaking it for him much better than he had ever hitherto known it. His\nown children had always looked down upon him, regarding him merely\nas a coffer from whence money might be had; and he, though he had\nnever resented this contempt, had in a certain measure been aware of\nit. But there was no such feeling shown by his wife. She took the\nbenefits which he gave her graciously and thankfully, and gave back\nto him in return, certainly her care and time, and apparently her\nlove. For herself, in the way of wealth and money, she never asked\nfor anything.\n\nAnd then the baby had come, young Lucius Mason, and there was of\ncourse great joy at Orley Farm. The old father felt that the world\nhad begun again for him, very delightfully, and was more than ever\nsatisfied with his wisdom in regard to that marriage. But the very\ngenteel progeny of his early youth were more than ever dissatisfied,\nand in their letters among themselves dealt forth harder and still\nharder words upon poor Sir Joseph. What terrible things might he not\nbe expected to do now that his dotage was coming on? Those three\nmarried ladies had no selfish fears--so at least they declared, but\nthey united in imploring their brother to look after his interests at\nOrley Farm. How dreadfully would the young heir of Groby be curtailed\nin his dignities and seignories if it should be found at the last day\nthat Orley Farm was not to be written in his rent-roll!\n\nAnd then, while they were yet bethinking themselves how they might\nbest bestir themselves, news arrived that Sir Joseph had suddenly\ndied. Sir Joseph was dead, and the will when read contained a codicil\nby which that young brat was made the heir to the Orley Farm estate.\nI have said that Lady Mason during her married life had never asked\nof her husband anything for herself; but in the law proceedings which\nwere consequent upon Sir Joseph's death, it became abundantly evident\nthat she had asked him for much for her son,--and that she had been\nspecific in her requests, urging him to make a second heir, and to\nsettle Orley Farm upon her own boy, Lucius. She herself stated that\nshe had never done this except in the presence of a third person. She\nhad often done so in the presence of Mr. Usbech the attorney,--as to\nwhich Mr. Usbech was not alive to testify; and she had also done so\nmore than once in the presence of Mr. Furnival, a barrister,--as to\nwhich Mr. Furnival, being alive, did testify--very strongly.\n\nAs to that contest nothing further need now be said. It resulted in\nthe favour of young Lucius Mason, and therefore, also, in the favour\nof the widow;--in the favour moreover of Miriam Usbech, and thus\nultimately in the favour of Mr. Samuel Dockwrath, who is now showing\nhimself to be so signally ungrateful. Joseph Mason, however, retired\nfrom the battle nothing convinced. His father, he said, had been\nan old fool, an ass, an idiot, a vulgar, ignorant fool; but he was\nnot a man to break his word. That signature to the codicil might be\nhis or might not. If his, it had been obtained by fraud. What could\nbe easier than to cheat an old doting fool? Many men agreed with\nJoseph Mason, thinking that Usbech the attorney had perpetrated this\nvillainy on behalf of his daughter; but Joseph Mason would believe,\nor say that he believed--a belief in which none but his sisters\njoined him,--that Lady Mason herself had been the villain. He was\nminded to press the case on to a Court of Appeal, up even to the\nHouse of Lords; but he was advised that in doing so he would spend\nmore money than Orley Farm was worth, and that he would, almost to a\ncertainty, spend it in vain. Under this advice he cursed the laws of\nhis country, and withdrew to Groby Park.\n\nLady Mason had earned the respect of all those around her by the way\nin which she bore herself in the painful days of the trial, and also\nin those of her success,--especially also by the manner in which she\ngave her evidence. And thus, though she had not been much noticed\nby her neighbours during the short period of her married life, she\nwas visited as a widow by many of the more respectable people round\nHamworth. In all this she showed no feeling of triumph; she never\nabused her husband's relatives, or spoke much of the harsh manner\nin which she had been used. Indeed, she was not given to talk about\nher own personal affairs; and although, as I have said, many of her\nneighbours visited her, she did not lay herself out for society. She\naccepted and returned their attention, but for the most part seemed\nto be willing that the matter should so rest. The people around by\ndegrees came to know her ways, they spoke to her when they met her,\nand occasionally went through the ceremony of a morning call; but did\nnot ask her to their tea-parties, and did not expect to see her at\npicnic and archery meetings.\n\nAmong those who took her by the hand in the time of her great trouble\nwas Sir Peregrine Orme of The Cleeve,--for such was the name which\nhad belonged time out of mind to his old mansion and park. Sir\nPeregrine was a gentleman now over seventy years of age, whose family\nconsisted of the widow of his only son, and the only son of that\nwidow, who was of course the heir to his estate and title. Sir\nPeregrine was an excellent old man, as I trust may hereafter be\nacknowledged; but his regard for Lady Mason was perhaps in the first\ninstance fostered by his extreme dislike to her stepson, Joseph Mason\nof Groby. Mr. Joseph Mason of Groby was quite as rich a man as Sir\nPeregrine, and owned an estate which was nearly as large as The\nCleeve property; but Sir Peregrine would not allow that he was a\ngentleman, or that he could by any possible transformation become\none. He had not probably ever said so in direct words to any of the\nMason family, but his opinion on the matter had in some way worked\nits way down to Yorkshire, and therefore there was no love to spare\nbetween these two county magistrates. There had been a slight\nacquaintance between Sir Peregrine and Sir Joseph; but the ladies of\nthe two families had never met till after the death of the latter.\nThen, while that trial was still pending, Mrs. Orme had come forward\nat the instigation of her father-in-law, and by degrees there had\ngrown up an intimacy between the two widows. When the first offers\nof assistance were made and accepted, Sir Peregrine no doubt did\nnot at all dream of any such result as this. His family pride, and\nespecially the pride which he took in his widowed daughter-in-law,\nwould probably have been shocked by such a surmise; but,\nnevertheless, he had seen the friendship grow and increase without\nalarm. He himself had become attached to Lady Mason, and had\ngradually learned to excuse in her that want of gentle blood and\nearly breeding which as a rule he regarded as necessary to a\ngentleman, and from which alone, as he thought, could spring many of\nthose excellences which go to form the character of a lady.\n\nIt may therefore be asserted that Lady Mason's widowed life was\nsuccessful. That it was prudent and well conducted no one could\ndoubt. Her neighbours of course did say of her that she would not\ndrink tea with Mrs. Arkwright of Mount Pleasant villa because she was\nallowed the privilege of entering Sir Peregrine's drawing-room; but\nsuch little scandal as this was a matter of course. Let one live\naccording to any possible or impossible rule, yet some offence will\nbe given in some quarter. Those who knew anything of Lady Mason's\nprivate life were aware that she did not encroach on Sir Peregrine's\nhospitality. She was not at The Cleeve as much as circumstances would\nhave justified, and at one time by no means so much as Mrs. Orme\nwould have desired.\n\nIn person she was tall and comely. When Sir Joseph had brought her\nto his house she had been very fair,--tall, slight, fair, and very\nquiet,--not possessing that loveliness which is generally most\nattractive to men, because the beauty of which she might boast\ndepended on form rather than on the brightness of her eye, or the\nsoftness of her cheek and lips. Her face too, even at that age,\nseldom betrayed emotion, and never showed signs either of anger or of\njoy. Her forehead was high, and though somewhat narrow, nevertheless\ngave evidence of considerable mental faculties; nor was the evidence\nfalse, for those who came to know Lady Mason well, were always ready\nto acknowledge that she was a woman of no ordinary power. Her eyes\nwere large and well formed, but somewhat cold. Her nose was long and\nregular. Her mouth also was very regular, and her teeth perfectly\nbeautiful; but her lips were straight and thin. It would sometimes\nseem that she was all teeth, and yet it is certain that she never\nmade an effort to show them. The great fault of her face was in\nher chin, which was too small and sharp, thus giving on occasions\nsomething of meanness to her countenance. She was now forty-seven\nyears of age, and had a son who had reached man's estate; and yet\nperhaps she had more of woman's beauty at this present time than\nwhen she stood at the altar with Sir Joseph Mason. The quietness and\nrepose of her manner suited her years and her position; age had given\nfulness to her tall form; and the habitual sadness of her countenance\nwas in fair accordance with her condition and character. And yet\nshe was not really sad,--at least so said those who knew her. The\nmelancholy was in her face rather than in her character, which was\nfull of energy,--if energy may be quiet as well as assured and\nconstant.\n\nOf course she had been accused a dozen times of matrimonial\nprospects. What handsome widow is not so accused? The world of\nHamworth had been very certain at one time that she was intent on\nmarrying Sir Peregrine Orme. But she had not married, and I think I\nmay say on her behalf that she had never thought of marrying. Indeed,\none cannot see how such a woman could make any effort in that line.\nIt was impossible to conceive that a lady so staid in her manner\nshould be guilty of flirting; nor was there any man within ten miles\nof Hamworth who would have dared to make the attempt. Women for the\nmost part are prone to love-making--as nature has intended that they\nshould be; but there are women from whom all such follies seem to be\nas distant as skittles and beer are distant from the dignity of the\nLord Chancellor. Such a woman was Lady Mason.\n\nAt this time--the time which is about to exist for us as the period\nat which our narrative will begin--Lucius Mason was over twenty-two\nyears old, and was living at the farm. He had spent the last three or\nfour years of his life in Germany, where his mother had visited him\nevery year, and had now come home intending to be the master of his\nown destiny. His mother's care for him during his boyhood, and up to\nthe time at which he became of age, had been almost elaborate in its\nthoughtfulness. She had consulted Sir Peregrine as to his school, and\nSir Peregrine, looking to the fact of the lad's own property, and\nalso to the fact, known by him, of Lady Mason's means for such a\npurpose, had recommended Harrow. But the mother had hesitated, had\ngently discussed the matter, and had at last persuaded the baronet\nthat such a step would be injudicious. The boy was sent to a private\nschool of a high character, and Sir Peregrine was sure that he had\nbeen so sent at his own advice. \"Looking at the peculiar position of\nhis mother,\" said Sir Peregrine to his young daughter-in-law, \"at her\nvery peculiar position, and that of his relatives, I think it will be\nbetter that he should not appear to assume anything early in life;\nnothing can be better conducted than Mr. Crabfield's establishment,\nand after much consideration I have had no hesitation in recommending\nher to send her son to him.\" And thus Lucius Mason had been sent to\nMr. Crabfield, but I do not think that the idea originated with Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"And perhaps it will be as well,\" added the baronet, \"that he and\nPerry should not be together at school, though I have no objection to\ntheir meeting in the holidays. Mr. Crabfield's vacations are always\ntimed to suit the Harrow holidays.\" The Perry here mentioned was the\ngrandson of Sir Peregrine--the young Peregrine who in coming days was\nto be the future lord of The Cleeve. When Lucius Mason was modestly\nsent to Mr. Crabfield's establishment at Great Marlow, young\nPeregrine Orme, with his prouder hopes, commenced his career at the\npublic school.\n\nMr. Crabfield did his duty by Lucius Mason, and sent him home at\nseventeen a handsome, well-mannered lad, tall and comely to the\neye, with soft brown whiskers sprouting on his cheek, well grounded\nin Greek, Latin, and Euclid, grounded also in French and Italian,\nand possessing many more acquirements than he would have learned\nat Harrow. But added to these, or rather consequent on them, was\na conceit which public-school education would not have created.\nWhen their mothers compared them in the holidays, not openly with\noutspoken words, but silently in their hearts, Lucius Mason was found\nby each to be the superior both in manners and knowledge; but each\nacknowledged also that there was more of ingenuous boyhood about\nPeregrine Orme.\n\nPeregrine Orme was a year the younger, and therefore his comparative\ndeficiencies were not the cause of any intense sorrow at The Cleeve;\nbut his grandfather would probably have been better satisfied--and\nperhaps also so would his mother--had he been less addicted to the\ncatching of rats, and better inclined towards Miss Edgeworth's novels\nand Shakespeare's plays, which were earnestly recommended to him by\nthe lady and the gentleman. But boys generally are fond of rats, and\nvery frequently are not fond of reading; and therefore, all this\nhaving been duly considered, there was not much deep sorrow in those\ndays at The Cleeve as to the boyhood of the heir.\n\nBut there was great pride at Orley Farm, although that pride was\nshown openly to no one. Lady Mason in her visits at The Cleeve said\nbut little as to her son's present excellences. As to his future\ncareer in life she did say much both to Sir Peregrine and to Mrs.\nOrme, asking the council of the one and expressing her fears to the\nother; and then, Sir Peregrine having given his consent, she sent the\nlad to Germany.\n\nHe was allowed to come of age without any special signs of manhood,\nor aught of the glory of property; although, in his case, that coming\nof age did put him into absolute possession of his inheritance. On\nthat day, had he been so minded, he could have turned his mother out\nof the farm-house, and taken exclusive possession of the estate; but\nhe did in fact remain in Germany for a year beyond this period, and\nreturned to Orley Farm only in time to be present at the celebration\nof the twenty-first birthday of his friend Peregrine Orme. This\nceremony, as may be surmised, was by no means slurred over without\ndue rejoicing. The heir at the time was at Christchurch; but at such\na period a slight interruption to his studies was not to be lamented.\nThere had been Sir Peregrine Ormes in those parts ever since the days\nof James I; and indeed in days long antecedent to those there had\nbeen knights bearing that name, some of whom had been honourably\nbeheaded for treason, others imprisoned for heresy; and one made\naway with on account of a supposed royal amour,--to the great\nglorification of all his descendants. Looking to the antecedents of\nthe family, it was only proper that the coming of age of the heir\nshould be duly celebrated; but Lucius Mason had had no antecedents;\nno great-great-grandfather of his had knelt at the feet of an\nimproper princess; and therefore Lady Mason, though she had been at\nThe Cleeve, had not mentioned the fact that on that very day her son\nhad become a man. But when Peregrine Orme became a man--though still\nin his manhood too much devoted to rats--she gloried greatly in her\nquiet way, and whispered a hope into the baronet's ear that the young\nheir would not imitate the ambition of his ancestor. \"No, by Jove! it\nwould not do now at all,\" said Sir Peregrine, by no means displeased\nat the allusion.\n\nAnd then that question as to the future life of Lucius Mason became\none of great importance, and it was necessary to consult, not only\nSir Peregrine Orme, but the young man himself. His mother had\nsuggested to him first the law: the great Mr. Furnival, formerly of\nthe home circuit, but now practising only in London, was her very\nspecial friend, and would give her and her son all possible aid in\nthis direction. And what living man could give better aid than the\ngreat Mr. Furnival? But Lucius Mason would have none of the law. This\nresolve he pronounced very clearly while yet in Germany, whither his\nmother visited him, bearing with her a long letter written by the\ngreat Mr. Furnival himself. But nevertheless young Mason would have\nnone of the law. \"I have an idea,\" he said, \"that lawyers are all\nliars.\" Whereupon his mother rebuked him for his conceited ignorance\nand want of charity; but she did not gain her point.\n\nShe had, however, another string to her bow. As he objected to be a\nlawyer, he might become a civil engineer. Circumstances had made Sir\nPeregrine Orme very intimate with the great Mr. Brown. Indeed, Mr.\nBrown was under great obligations to Sir Peregrine, and Sir Peregrine\nhad promised to use his influence. But Lucius Mason said that civil\nengineers were only tradesmen of an upper class, tradesmen with\nintellects; and he, he said, wished to use his intellect, but he did\nnot choose to be a tradesman. His mother rebuked him again, as well\nhe deserved that she should,--and then asked him of what profession\nhe himself had thought. \"Philology,\" said he; \"or as a profession,\nperhaps literature. I shall devote myself to philology and the races\nof man. Nothing considerable has been done with them as a combined\npursuit.\" And with these views he returned home--while Peregrine Orme\nat Oxford was still addicted to the hunting of rats.\n\nBut with philology and the races of man he consented to combine the\npursuit of agriculture. When his mother found that he wished to take\nup his abode in his own house, she by no means opposed him, and\nsuggested that, as such was his intention, he himself should farm his\nown land. He was very ready to do this, and had she not represented\nthat such a step was in every way impolitic, he would willingly have\nrequested Mr. Greenwood of the Old Farm to look elsewhere, and have\nspread himself and his energies over the whole domain. As it was he\ncontented himself with desiring that Mr. Dockwrath would vacate his\nsmall holding, and as he was imperative as to that his mother gave\nway without making it the cause of a battle. She would willingly have\nleft Mr. Dockwrath in possession, and did say a word or two as to the\nmilk necessary for those sixteen children. But Lucius Mason was ducal\nin his ideas, and intimated an opinion that he had a right to do what\nhe liked with his own. Had not Mr. Dockwrath been told, when the\nfields were surrendered to him as a favour, that he would only have\nthem in possession till the heir should come of age? Mr. Dockwrath\nhad been so told; but tellings such as these are easily forgotten by\nmen with sixteen children. And thus Mr. Mason became an agriculturist\nwith special scientific views as to chemistry, and a philologist\nwith the object of making that pursuit bear upon his studies with\nreference to the races of man. He was convinced that by certain\nadmixtures of ammonia and earths he could produce cereal results\nhitherto unknown to the farming world, and that by tracing out the\nroots of words he could trace also the wanderings of man since the\nexpulsion of Adam from the garden. As to the latter question his\nmother was not inclined to contradict him. Seeing that he would sit\nat the feet neither of Mr. Furnival nor of Mr. Brown, she had no\nobjection to the races of man. She could endure to be talked to about\nthe Oceanic Mongolidae and the Iapetidae of the Indo-Germanic class,\nand had perhaps her own ideas that such matters, though somewhat\nfoggy, were better than rats. But when he came to the other subject,\nand informed her that the properly plentiful feeding of the world\nwas only kept waiting for the chemists, she certainly did have her\nfears. Chemical agriculture is expensive; and though the results may\npossibly be remunerative, still, while we are thus kept waiting by\nthe backwardness of the chemists, there must be much risk in making\nany serious expenditure with such views.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, when he had now been at home about three months,\nand when the fiat for the expulsion of Samuel Dockwrath had already\ngone forth, \"I shall go to Liverpool to-morrow.\"\n\n\"To Liverpool, Lucius?\"\n\n\"Yes. That guano which I got from Walker is adulterated. I have\nanalyzed it, and find that it does not contain above thirty-two and a\nhalf hundredths of--of that which it ought to hold in a proportion of\nseventy-five per cent. of the whole.\"\n\n\"Does it not?\"\n\n\"No; and it is impossible to obtain results while one is working with\nsuch fictitious materials. Look at that bit of grass at the bottom of\nGreenwood's Hill.\"\n\n\"The fifteen-acre field? Why, Lucius, we always had the heaviest\ncrops of hay in the parish off that meadow.\"\n\n\"That's all very well, mother; but you have never tried,--nobody\nabout here ever has tried, what the land can really produce. I will\nthrow that and the three fields beyond it into one; I will get\nGreenwood to let me have that bit of the hill-side, giving him\ncompensation of course--\"\n\n\"And then Dockwrath would want compensation.\"\n\n\"Dockwrath is an impertinent rascal, and I shall take an opportunity\nof telling him so. But as I was saying, I will throw those seventy\nacres together, and then I will try what will be the relative effects\nof guano and the patent blood, But I must have real guano, and so I\nshall go to Liverpool.\"\n\n\"I think I would wait a little, Lucius. It is almost too late for any\nchange of that kind this year.\"\n\n\"Wait! Yes, and what has come of waiting? We don't wait at all in\ndoubling our population every thirty-three years; but when we come\nto the feeding of them we are always for waiting. It is that waiting\nwhich has reduced the intellectual development of one half of the\nhuman race to its present terribly low state--or rather prevented its\nrising in a degree proportionate to the increase of the population.\nNo more waiting for me, mother, if I can help it.\"\n\n\"But, Lucius, should not such new attempts as that be made by men\nwith large capital?\" said the mother.\n\n\"Capital is a bugbear,\" said the son, speaking on this matter quite\n_ex cathedr\u00c3\u00a2_, as no doubt he was entitled to do by his extensive\nreading at a German university--\"capital is a bugbear. The capital\nthat is really wanting is thought, mind, combination, knowledge.\"\n\n\"But, Lucius--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know what you are going to say, mother. I don't boast that\nI possess all these things; but I do say that I will endeavour to\nobtain them.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you will; but should not that come first?\"\n\n\"That is waiting again. We all know as much as this, that good manure\nwill give good crops if the sun be allowed full play upon the land,\nand nothing but the crop be allowed to grow. That is what I shall\nattempt at first, and there can be no great danger in that.\" And so\nhe went to Liverpool.\n\nLady Mason during his absence began to regret that she had not left\nhim in the undisturbed and inexpensive possession of the Mongolidae\nand the Iapetidae. His rent from the estate, including that which she\nwould have paid him as tenant of the smaller farm, would have enabled\nhim to live with all comfort; and, if such had been his taste, he\nmight have become a philosophical student, and lived respectably\nwithout adding anything to his income by the sweat of his brow. But\nnow the matter was likely to become serious enough. For a gentleman\nfarmer determined to wait no longer for the chemists, whatever might\nbe the results, an immediate profitable return per acre could not be\nexpected as one of them. Any rent from that smaller farm would now\nbe out of the question, and it would be well if the payments made\nso punctually by old Mr. Greenwood were not also swallowed up in\nthe search after unadulterated guano. Who could tell whether in\nthe pursuit of science he might not insist on chartering a vessel,\nhimself, for the Peruvian coast?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE CLEEVE.\n\n\nI have said that Sir Peregrine Orme was not a rich man, meaning\nthereby that he was not a rich man considering his acknowledged\nposition in the county. Such men not uncommonly have their tens,\ntwelves, and twenty thousands a year; but Sir Peregrine's estate\ndid not give him above three or four. He was lord of the manor of\nHamworth, and possessed seignorial rights, or rather the skeleton and\nremembrance of such rights with reference to a very large district of\ncountry; but his actual property--that from which he still received\nthe substantial benefits of ownership--was not so large as those\nof some of his neighbours. There was, however, no place within the\ncounty which was so beautifully situated as The Cleeve, or which had\nabout it so many of the attractions of age. The house itself had been\nbuilt at two periods,--a new set of rooms having been added to the\nremains of the old Elizabethan structure in the time of Charles II.\nIt had not about it anything that was peculiarly grand or imposing,\nnor were the rooms large or even commodious; but everything was old,\nvenerable, and picturesque. Both the dining-room and the library were\npanelled with black wainscoating; and though the drawing-rooms were\npapered, the tall, elaborately-worked wooden chimney-pieces still\nstood in them, and a wooden band or belt round the rooms showed that\nthe panels were still there, although hidden by the modern paper.\n\nBut it was for the beauty and wildness of its grounds that The Cleeve\nwas remarkable. The land fell here and there into narrow, wild\nravines and woody crevices. The soil of the park was not rich, and\ncould give but little assistance to the chemists in supplying the\nplentiful food expected by Mr. Mason for the coming multitudes of the\nworld; it produced in some parts heather instead of grass, and was\nas wild and unprofitable as Cleeve Common, which stretched for miles\noutside the park palings; but it seemed admirably adapted for deer\nand for the maintenance of half-decayed venerable oaks. Young timber\nalso throve well about the place, and in this respect Sir Peregrine\nwas a careful landlord. There ran a river through the park,--the\nRiver Cleeve, from which the place and parish are said to have\ntaken their names;--a river, or rather a stream, very narrow and\ninconsiderable as to its volume of water, but which passed for some\ntwo miles through so narrow a passage as to give to it the appearance\nof a cleft or fissure in the rocks. The water tumbled over stones\nthrough this entire course, making it seem to be fordable almost\neverywhere without danger of wet feet; but in truth there was hardly\na spot at which it could be crossed without a bold leap from rock to\nrock. Narrow as was the aperture through which the water had cut its\nway, nevertheless a path had been contrived now on one side of the\nstream and now on the other, crossing it here and there by slight\nhanging wooden bridges. The air here was always damp with spray, and\nthe rocks on both sides were covered with long mosses, as were also\nthe overhanging boughs of the old trees. This place was the glory\nof The Cleeve, and as far as picturesque beauty goes it was very\nglorious. There was a spot in the river from whence a steep path led\ndown from the park to the water, and at this spot the deer would come\nto drink. I know nothing more beautiful than this sight, when three\nor four of them could be so seen from one of the wooden bridges\ntowards the hour of sunset in the autumn.\n\nSir Peregrine himself at this time was an old man, having passed his\nseventieth year. He was a fine, handsome English gentleman with white\nhair, keen gray eyes, a nose slightly aquiline, and lips now too\nclosely pressed together in consequence of the havoc which time had\nmade among his teeth. He was tall, but had lost something of his\nheight from stooping,--was slight in his form, but well made, and\nvain of the smallness of his feet and the whiteness of his hands. He\nwas generous, quick tempered, and opinionated; generally very mild to\nthose who would agree with him and submit to him, but intolerant of\ncontradiction, and conceited as to his experience of the world and\nthe wisdom which he had thence derived. To those who were manifestly\nhis inferiors he was affable, to his recognised equals he was\ncourteous, to women he was almost always gentle;--but to men who\nclaimed an equality which he would not acknowledge, he could make\nhimself particularly disagreeable. In judging the position which a\nman should hold in the world, Sir Peregrine was very resolute in\nignoring all claims made by wealth alone. Even property in land could\nnot in his eyes create a gentleman. A gentleman, according to his\nideas, should at any rate have great-grandfathers capable of being\ntraced in the world's history; and the greater the number of such,\nand the more easily traceable they might be on the world's surface,\nthe more unquestionable would be the status of the claimant in\nquestion. Such being the case, it may be imagined that Joseph Mason,\nEsq., of Groby Park did not rank high in the estimation of Sir\nPeregrine Orme.\n\nI have said that Sir Peregrine was fond of his own opinion; but\nnevertheless he was a man whom it was by no means difficult to lead.\nIn the first place he was singularly devoid of suspicion. The word of\na man or of a woman was to him always credible, until full proof had\ncome home to him that it was utterly unworthy of credit. After that\nsuch a man or woman might as well spare all speech as regards the\nhope of any effect on the mind of Sir Peregrine Orme. He did not\neasily believe a fellow-creature to be a liar, but a liar to him once\nwas a liar always. And then he was amenable to flattery, and few that\nare so are proof against the leading-strings of their flatterers. All\nthis was well understood of Sir Peregrine by those about him. His\ngardener, his groom, and his woodman all knew his foibles. They all\nloved him, respected him, and worked for him faithfully; but each of\nthem had his own way in his own branch.\n\nAnd there was another person at The Cleeve who took into her own\nhands a considerable share of the management and leading of Sir\nPeregrine, though, in truth, she made no efforts in that direction.\nThis was Mrs. Orme, the widow of his only child, and the mother of\nhis heir. Mrs. Orme was a younger woman than Mrs. Mason of Orley Farm\nby nearly five years, though her son was but twelve months junior to\nLucius Mason. She had been the daughter of a brother baronet, whose\nfamily was nearly as old as that of the Ormes; and therefore, though\nshe had come penniless to her husband, Sir Peregrine had considered\nthat his son had married well. She had been a great beauty, very\nsmall in size and delicate of limb, fair haired, with soft blue\nwondering eyes, and a dimpled cheek. Such she had been when young\nPeregrine Orme brought her home to The Cleeve, and the bride at once\nbecame the darling of her father-in-law. One year she had owned\nof married joy, and then all the happiness of the family had been\nutterly destroyed, and for the few following years there had been no\nsadder household in all the country-side than that of Sir Peregrine\nOrme. His son, his only son, the pride of all who knew him, the hope\nof his political party in the county, the brightest among the bright\nones of the day for whom the world was just opening her richest\ntreasures, fell from his horse as he was crossing into a road, and\nhis lifeless body was brought home to The Cleeve.\n\nAll this happened now twenty years since, but the widow still wears\nthe colours of mourning. Of her also the world of course said that\nshe would soon console herself with a second love; but she too has\ngiven the world the lie. From that day to the present she has never\nleft the house of her father-in-law; she has been a true child to\nhim, and she has enjoyed all a child's privileges. There has been\nbut little favour for any one at The Cleeve who has been considered\nby the baronet to disregard the wishes of the mistress of the\nestablishment. Any word from her has been law to him, and he has of\ncourse expected also that her word should be law to others. He has\nyielded to her in all things, and attended to her will as though she\nwere a little queen, recognizing in her feminine weakness a sovereign\npower, as some men can and do; and having thus for years indulged\nhimself in a quixotic gallantry to the lady of his household, he has\ndemanded of others that they also should bow the knee.\n\nDuring the last twenty years The Cleeve has not been a gay house.\nDuring the last ten those living there have been contented, and in\nthe main happy; but there has seldom been many guests in the old\nhall, and Sir Peregrine has not been fond of going to other men's\nfeasts. He inherited the property very early in life, and then there\nwere on it some few encumbrances. While yet a young man he added\nsomething to these, and now, since his own son's death, he has been\nsetting his house in order, that his grandson should receive the\nfamily acres intact. Every shilling due on the property has been paid\noff; and it is well that this should be so, for there is reason to\nfear that the heir will want a helping hand out of some of youth's\ndifficulties,--perhaps once or twice before his passion for rats\ngives place to a good English gentleman-like resolve to hunt twice a\nweek, look after his timber, and live well within his means.\n\nThe chief fault in the character of young Peregrine Orme was that\nhe was so young. There are men who are old at one-and-twenty,--are\nquite fit for Parliament, the magistrate's bench, the care of a wife,\nand even for that much sterner duty, the care of a balance at the\nbankers; but there are others who at that age are still boys,--whose\ninner persons and characters have not begun to clothe themselves with\nthe \"toga virilis.\" I am not sure that those whose boyhoods are so\nprotracted have the worst of it, if in this hurrying and competitive\nage they can be saved from being absolutely trampled in the dust\nbefore they are able to do a little trampling on their own account.\nFruit that grows ripe the quickest is not the sweetest; nor when\nhoused and garnered will it keep the longest. For young Peregrine\nthere was no need of competitive struggles. The days have not yet\ncome, though they are no doubt coming, when \"detur digniori\" shall\nbe the rule of succession to all titles, honours, and privileges\nwhatsoever. Only think what a life it would give to the education of\nthe country in general, if any lad from seventeen to twenty-one could\ngo in for a vacant dukedom; and if a goodly inheritance could be\nmade absolutely incompatible with incorrect spelling and doubtful\nproficiency in rule of three!\n\nLuckily for Peregrine junior these days are not yet at hand, or I\nfear that there would be little chance for him. While Lucius Mason\nwas beginning to think that the chemists might be hurried, and that\nagriculture might be beneficially added to philology, our friend\nPeregrine had just been rusticated, and the head of his college had\nintimated to the baronet that it would be well to take the young\nman's name off the college books. This accordingly had been done,\nand the heir of The Cleeve was at present at home with his mother\nand grandfather. What special act of grace had led to this severity\nwe need not inquire, but we may be sure that the frolics of which\nhe had been guilty had been essentially young in their nature. He\nhad assisted in driving a farmer's sow into the man's best parlour,\nor had daubed the top of the tutor's cap with white paint, or had\nperhaps given liberty to a bag full of rats in the college hall at\ndinner-time. Such were the youth's academical amusements, and as they\nwere pursued with unremitting energy it was thought well that he\nshould be removed from Oxford.\n\nThen had come the terrible question of his university bills. One\nafter another, half a score of them reached Sir Peregrine, and then\ntook place that terrible interview,--such as most young men have had\nto undergo at least once,--in which he was asked how he intended to\nabsolve himself from the pecuniary liabilities which he had incurred.\n\n\"I am sure I don't know,\" said young Orme, sadly.\n\n\"But I shall be glad, sir, if you will favour me with your\nintentions,\" said Sir Peregrine, with severity. \"A gentleman does\nnot, I presume, send his orders to a tradesman without having some\nintention of paying him for his goods.\"\n\n[Illustration: SIR PEREGRINE AND HIS HEIR.]\n\n\"I intended that they should all be paid, of course.\"\n\n\"And how, sir? by whom?\"\n\n\"Well, sir,--I suppose I intended that you should pay them;\" and\nthe scapegrace as he spoke looked full up into the baronet's face\nwith his bright blue eyes,--not impudently, as though defying his\ngrandfather, but with a bold confidence which at once softened the\nold man's heart.\n\nSir Peregrine turned away and walked twice the length of the library;\nthen, returning to the spot where the other stood, he put his hand on\nhis grandson's shoulder. \"Well, Peregrine, I will pay them,\" he said.\n\"I have no doubt that you did so intend when you incurred them;--and\nthat was perhaps natural. I will pay them; but for your own sake, and\nfor your dear mother's sake, I hope that they are not very heavy. Can\nyou give me a list of all that you owe?\"\n\nYoung Peregrine said that he thought he could, and sitting down at\nonce he made a clean breast of it. With all his foibles, follies, and\nyouthful ignorances, in two respects he stood on good ground. He was\nneither false nor a coward. He continued to scrawl down items as long\nas there were any of which he could think, and then handed over the\nlist in order that his grandfather might add them up. It was the\nlast he ever heard of the matter; and when he revisited Oxford some\ntwelve months afterwards, the tradesmen whom he had honoured with his\ncustom bowed to him as low as though he had already inherited twenty\nthousand a year.\n\nPeregrine Orme was short in stature as was his mother, and he also\nhad his mother's wonderfully bright blue eyes; but in other respects\nhe was very like his father and grandfather;--very like all the\nOrmes who had lived for ages past. His hair was light; his forehead\nwas not large, but well formed and somewhat prominent; his nose\nhad something, though not much, of the eagle's beak; his mouth was\nhandsome in its curve, and his teeth were good, and his chin was\ndivided by a deep dimple. His figure was not only short, but stouter\nthan that of the Ormes in general. He was very strong on his legs; he\ncould wrestle, and box, and use the single-stick with a quickness and\nprecision that was the terror of all the freshmen who had come in his\nway.\n\nMrs. Orme, his mother, no doubt thought that he was perfect. Looking\nat the reflex of her own eyes in his, and seeing in his face so sweet\na portraiture of the nose and mouth and forehead of him whom she\nhad loved so dearly and lost so soon, she could not but think him\nperfect. When she was told that the master of Lazarus had desired\nthat her son should be removed from his college, she had accused the\ntyrant of unrelenting, persecuting tyranny; and the gentle arguments\nof Sir Peregrine had no effect towards changing her ideas. On that\ndisagreeable matter of the bills little or nothing was said to her.\nIndeed, money was a subject with which she was never troubled. Sir\nPeregrine conceived that money was a man's business, and that the\nsoftness of a woman's character should be preserved by a total\nabsence of all pecuniary thoughts and cares.\n\nAnd then there arose at The Cleeve a question as to what should\nimmediately be done with the heir. He himself was by no means so well\nprepared with an answer as had been his friend Lucius Mason. When\nconsulted by his grandfather, he said that he did not know. He would\ndo anything that Sir Peregrine wished. Would Sir Peregrine think\nit well that he should prepare himself for the arduous duties of a\nmaster of hounds? Sir Peregrine did not think this at all well, but\nit did not appear that he himself was prepared with any immediate\nproposition. Then Peregrine discussed the matter with his mother,\nexplaining that he had hoped at any rate to get the next winter's\nhunting with the H.H.;--which letters have represented the Hamworth\nFox Hunt among sporting men for many years past. To this his mother\nmade no objection, expressing a hope, however, that he would go\nabroad in the spring. \"Home-staying youths have ever homely wits,\"\nshe said to him, smiling on him ever so sweetly.\n\n\"That's quite true, mother,\" he said. \"And that's why I should like\nto go to Leicestershire this winter.\" But going to Leicestershire\nthis winter was out of the question.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE PERILS OF YOUTH.\n\n\nGoing to Leicestershire was quite out of the question for young Orme\nat this period of his life, but going to London unfortunately was\nnot so. He had become acquainted at Oxford with a gentleman of\ngreat skill in his peculiar line of life, whose usual residence\nwas in the metropolis; and so great had been the attraction found\nin the character and pursuits of this skilful gentleman, that our\nhero had not been long at The Cleeve, after his retirement from\nthe university, before he visited his friend. Cowcross Street,\nSmithfield, was the site of this professor's residence, the\ndestruction of rats in a barrel was his profession, and his name\nwas Carroty Bob. It is not my intention to introduce the reader to\nCarroty Bob in person, as circumstances occurred about this time\nwhich brought his intimacy with Mr. Orme to an abrupt conclusion. It\nwould be needless to tell how our hero was induced to back a certain\nterrier, presumed to be the pride of Smithfield; how a great match\ncame off, second only in importance to a contest for the belt of\nEngland; how money was lost and quarrels arose, and how Peregrine\nOrme thrashed one sporting gent within an inch of his life, and\nfought his way out of Carroty Bob's house at twelve o'clock at night.\nThe tale of the row got into the newspapers, and of course reached\nThe Cleeve. Sir Peregrine sent for his grandson into his study, and\ninsisted on knowing everything;--how much money there was to pay, and\nwhat chance there might be of an action and damages. Of an action and\ndamages there did not seem to be any chance, and the amount of money\nclaimed was not large. Rats have this advantage, that they usually\ncome cheaper than race-horses; but then, as Sir Peregrine felt\nsorely, they do not sound so well.\n\n\"Do you know, sir, that you are breaking your mother's heart?\" said\nSir Peregrine, looking very sternly at the young man--as sternly as\nhe was able to look, let him do his worst.\n\nPeregrine the younger had a very strong idea that he was not doing\nanything of the kind. He had left her only a quarter of an hour\nsince; and though she had wept during the interview, she had forgiven\nhim with many caresses, and had expressed her opinion that the chief\nfault had lain with Carroty Bob and those other wretched people\nwho had lured her dear child into their villainous den. She had\naltogether failed to conceal her pride at his having fought his way\nout from among them, and had ended by supplying his pocket out of\nher own immediate resources. \"I hope not, sir,\" said Peregrine the\nyounger, thinking over some of these things.\n\n\"But you will, sir, if you go on with this shameless career. I do not\nspeak of myself. I do not expect you to sacrifice your tastes for me;\nbut I did think that you loved your mother!\"\n\n\"So I do;--and you too.\"\n\n\"I am not speaking about myself sir. When I think what your father\nwas at your age;--how nobly--\" And then the baronet was stopped in\nhis speech, and wiped his eyes with his handkerchief. \"Do you think\nthat your father, sir, followed such pursuits as these? Do you think\nthat he spent his time in the pursuit of--rats?\"\n\n\"Well; I don't know; I don't think he did. But I have heard you say,\nsir, that you sometimes went to cockfights when you were young.\"\n\n\"To cockfights! well, yes. But let me tell you, sir, that I always\nwent in the company of gentlemen--that is, when I did go, which was\nvery seldom.\" The baronet in some after-dinner half-hour had allowed\nthis secret of his youth to escape from him, imprudently.\n\n\"And I went to the house in Cowcross Street with Lord John Fitzjoly.\"\n\n\"The last man in all London with whom you ought to associate! But I\nam not going to argue with you, sir. If you think, and will continue\nto think, that the slaughtering of vermin is a proper pursuit--\"\n\n\"But, sir, foxes are vermin also.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, sir, and listen to me. You know very well what\nI mean, sir. If you think that--rats are a proper pursuit for a\ngentleman in your sphere of life, and if all that I can say has\nno effect in changing your opinion--I shall have done. I have not\nmany years of life before me, and when I shall be no more, you can\nsquander the property in any vile pursuits that may be pleasing to\nyou. But, sir, you shall not do it while I am living; nor, if I can\nhelp it, shall you rob your mother of such peace of mind as is left\nfor her in this world. I have only one alternative for you, sir--.\"\nSir Peregrine did not stop to explain what might be the other branch\nof this alternative. \"Will you give me your word of honour as\na gentleman that you will never again concern yourself in this\ndisgusting pursuit?\"\n\n\"Never, grandfather!\" said Peregrine, solemnly.\n\nSir Peregrine before he answered bethought himself that any pledge\ngiven for a whole life-time must be foolish; and he bethought himself\nalso that if he could wean his heir from rats for a year or so, the\ntaste would perish from lack of nourishment. \"I will say for two\nyears,\" said Sir Peregrine, still maintaining his austere look.\n\n\"For two years!\" repeated Peregrine the younger; \"and this is the\nfourth of October.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; for two years,\" said the baronet, more angry than ever at\nthe young man's pertinacity, and yet almost amused at his grandson's\nalready formed resolve to go back to his occupation at the first\nopportunity allowed.\n\n\"Couldn't you date it from the end of August, sir? The best of the\nmatches always come off in September.\"\n\n\"No, sir; I will not date it from any other time than the present.\nWill you give me your word of honour as a gentleman, for two years?\"\n\nPeregrine thought over the proposition for a minute or two in sad\nanticipation of all that he was to lose, and then slowly gave his\nadhesion to the terms. \"Very well, sir;--for two years.\" And then he\ntook out his pocket-book and wrote in it slowly.\n\nIt was at any rate manifest that he intended to keep his word, and\nthat was much; so Sir Peregrine accepted the promise for what it was\nworth. \"And now,\" said he, \"if you have got nothing better to do, we\nwill ride down to Crutchley Wood.\"\n\n\"I should like it of all things,\" said his grandson.\n\n\"Samson wants me to cut a new bridle-path through from the larches at\nthe top of the hill down to Crutchley Bottom; but I don't think I'll\nhave it done. Tell Jacob to let us have the nags; I'll ride the gray\npony. And ask your mother if she'll ride with us.\"\n\nIt was the manner of Sir Peregrine to forgive altogether when he did\nforgive; and to commence his forgiveness in all its integrity from\nthe first moment of the pardon. There was nothing he disliked so\nmuch as being on bad terms with those around him, and with none more\nso than with his grandson. Peregrine well knew how to make himself\npleasant to the old man, and when duly encouraged would always do so.\nAnd thus the family party, as they rode on this occasion through the\nwoods of The Cleeve, discussed oaks and larches, beech and birches,\nas though there were no such animal as a rat in existence, and no\nsuch place known as Cowcross Street.\n\n\"Well, Perry, as you and Samson are both of one mind, I suppose the\npath must be made,\" said Sir Peregrine, as he got off his horse at\nthe entrance of the stable-yard, and prepared to give his feeble aid\nto Mrs. Orme.\n\nShortly after this the following note was brought up to The Cleeve by\na messenger from Orley Farm:--\n\n\n   MY DEAR SIR PEREGRINE,\n\n   If you are quite disengaged at twelve o'clock to-morrow, I\n   will walk over to The Cleeve at that hour. Or if it would\n   suit you better to call here as you are riding, I would\n   remain within till you come. I want your kind advice on a\n   certain matter.\n\n   Most sincerely yours,\n\n   MARY MASON.\n\n   Thursday.\n\n\nLady Mason, when she wrote this note, was well aware that it would\nnot be necessary for her to go to The Cleeve. Sir Peregrine's\ncourtesy would not permit him to impose any trouble on a lady when\nthe alternative of taking that trouble on himself was given to him.\nMoreover, he liked to have some object for his daily ride; he liked\nto be consulted \"on certain matters;\" and he especially liked being\nso consulted by Lady Mason. So he sent word back that he would be at\nthe farm at twelve on the following day, and exactly at that hour his\ngray pony or cob might have been seen slowly walking up the avenue to\nthe farm-house.\n\nThe Cleeve was not distant from Orley Farm more than two miles by\nthe nearest walking-path, although it could not be driven much under\nfive. With any sort of carriage one was obliged to come from The\nCleeve House down to the lodge on the Hamworth and Alston road, and\nthen to drive through the town of Hamworth, and so back to the farm.\nBut in walking one would take the path along the river for nearly a\nmile, thence rise up the hill to the top of Crutchley Wood, descend\nthrough the wood to Crutchley Bottom, and, passing along the valley,\ncome out at the foot of Cleeve Hill, just opposite to Orley Farm\nGate. The distance for a horseman was somewhat greater, seeing that\nthere was not as yet any bridle-way through Crutchley Wood. Under\nthese circumstances the journey between the two houses was very\nfrequently made on foot; and for those walking from The Cleeve House\nto Hamworth the nearest way was by Lady Mason's gate.\n\nLady Mason's drawing-room was very pretty, though it was by no means\nfashionably furnished. Indeed, she eschewed fashion in all things,\nand made no pretence of coming out before the world as a great lady.\nShe had never kept any kind of carriage, though her means, combined\nwith her son's income, would certainly have justified her in a\npony-chaise. Since Lucius had become master of the house he had\npresented her with such a vehicle, and also with the pony and harness\ncomplete; but as yet she had never used it, being afraid, as she said\nto him with a smile, of appearing ambitious before the stern citizens\nof Hamworth. \"Nonsense, mother,\" he had replied, with a considerable\namount of young dignity in his face. \"We are all entitled to those\ncomforts for which we can afford to pay without injury to any one. I\nshall take it ill of you if I do not see you using it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir Peregrine, this is so kind of you,\" said Lady Mason, coming\nforward to meet her friend. She was plainly dressed, without any full\nexuberance of costume, and yet everything about her was neat and\npretty, and everything had been the object of feminine care. A very\nplain dress may occasion as much study as the most elaborate,--and\nmay be quite as worthy of the study it has caused. Lady Mason, I am\ninclined to think, was by no means indifferent to the subject, but\nthen to her belonged the great art of hiding her artifice.\n\n\"Not at all; not at all,\" said Sir Peregrine, taking her hand and\npressing it, as he always did. \"What is the use of neighbours if they\nare not neighbourly?\" This was all very well from Sir Peregrine in\nthe existing case; but he was not a man who by any means recognised\nthe necessity of being civil to all who lived near him. To the great\nand to the poor he was neighbourly; but it may be doubted whether\nhe would have thought much of Lady Mason if she had been less good\nlooking or less clever.\n\n\"Ah! I know how good you always are to me. But I'll tell you why I am\ntroubling you now. Lucius went off two days since to Liverpool.\"\n\n\"My grandson told me that he had left home.\"\n\n\"He is an excellent young man, and I am sure that I have every reason\nto be thankful.\" Sir Peregrine, remembering the affair in Cowcross\nStreet, and certain other affairs of a somewhat similar nature,\nthought that she had; but for all that he would not have exchanged\nhis own bright-eyed lad for Lucius Mason with all his virtues and all\nhis learning.\n\n\"And indeed I am thankful,\" continued the widow. \"Nothing can be\nbetter than his conduct and mode of life; but--\"\n\n\"I hope he has no attraction at Liverpool, of which you disapprove.\"\n\n\"No, no; there is nothing of that kind. His attraction is--; but\nperhaps I had better explain the whole matter. Lucius, you know, has\ntaken to farming.\"\n\n\"He has taken up the land which you held yourself, has he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, and a little more; and he is anxious to add even to that. He is\nvery energetic about it, Sir Peregrine.\"\n\n\"Well; the life of a gentleman farmer is not a bad one; though in\nhis special circumstances I would certainly have recommended a\nprofession.\"\n\n\"Acting upon your advice I did urge him to go to the bar. But he has\na will of his own, and a mind altogether made up as to the line of\nlife which he thinks will suit him best. What I fear now is, that he\nwill spend more money upon experiments than he can afford.\"\n\n\"Experimental farming is an expensive amusement,\" said Sir Peregrine,\nwith a very serious shake of his head.\n\n\"I am afraid it is; and now he has gone to Liverpool to buy--guano,\"\nsaid the widow, feeling some little shame in coming to so\ninconsiderable a conclusion after her somewhat stately prologue.\n\n\"To buy guano! Why could he not get his guano from Walker, as my man\nSymonds does?\"\n\n\"He says it is not good. He analyzed it, and--\"\n\n\"Fiddlestick! Why didn't he order it in London, if he didn't like\nWalker's. Gone to Liverpool for guano! I'll tell you what it is, Lady\nMason; if he intends to farm his land in that way, he should have a\nvery considerable capital at his back. It will be a long time before\nhe sees his money again.\" Sir Peregrine had been farming all his\nlife, and had his own ideas on the subject. He knew very well that no\ngentleman, let him set to work as he might with his own land, could\ndo as well with it as a farmer who must make a living out of his\nfarming besides paying the rent;--who must do that or else have no\nliving; and he knew also that such operations as those which his\nyoung friend was now about to attempt was an amusement fitted only\nfor the rich. It may be also that he was a little old-fashioned, and\ntherefore prejudiced against new combinations between agriculture and\nchemistry. \"He must put a stop to that kind of work very soon, Lady\nMason; he must indeed; or he will bring himself to ruin--and you with\nhim.\"\n\nLady Mason's face became very grave and serious. \"But what can I say\nto him, Sir Peregrine? In such a matter as that I am afraid that he\nwould not mind me. If you would not object to speaking to him?\"\n\nSir Peregrine was graciously pleased to say that he would not object.\nIt was a disagreeable task, he said, that of giving advice to a young\nman who was bound by no tie either to take it or even to receive it\nwith respect.\n\n\"You will not find him at all disrespectful; I think I can promise\nthat,\" said the frightened mother; and that matter was ended by a\npromise on the part of the baronet to take the case in hand, and to\nsee Lucius immediately on his return from Liverpool. \"He had better\ncome and dine at The Cleeve,\" said Sir Peregrine, \"and we will have\nit out after dinner.\" All of which made Lady Mason very grateful.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nSIR PEREGRINE MAKES A SECOND PROMISE.\n\n\nWe left Lady Mason very grateful at the end of the last chapter for\nthe promise made to her by Sir Peregrine with reference to her son;\nbut there was still a weight on Lady Mason's mind. They say that the\npith of a lady's letter is in the postscript, and it may be that that\nwhich remained for Lady Mason to say, was after all the matter as to\nwhich she was most anxious for assistance. \"As you are here,\" she\nsaid to the baronet, \"would you let me mention another subject?\"\n\n\"Surely,\" said he, again putting down his hat and riding-stick.\n\nSir Peregrine was not given to close observation of those around him,\nor he might have seen by the heightened colour of the lady's face,\nand by the slight nervous hesitation with which she began to speak,\nthat she was much in earnest as to this other matter. And had he been\nclever in his powers of observation he might have seen also that she\nwas anxious to hide this feeling. \"You remember the circumstances of\nthat terrible lawsuit?\" she said, at last.\n\n\"What; as to Sir Joseph's will? Yes; I remember them well.\"\n\n\"I know that I shall never forget all the kindness that you showed\nme,\" said she. \"I don't know how I should have lived through it\nwithout you and dear Mrs. Orme.\"\n\n\"But what about it now?\"\n\n\"I fear I am going to have further trouble.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that the man at Groby Park is going to try the case\nagain? It is not possible after such a lapse of time. I am no lawyer,\nbut I do not think that he can do it.\"\n\n\"I do not know--I do not know what he intends, or whether he intends\nanything; but I am sure of this,--that he will give me trouble if he\ncan. But I will tell you the whole story, Sir Peregrine. It is not\nmuch, and perhaps after all may not be worth attention. You know the\nattorney in Hamworth who married Miriam Usbech?\"\n\n\"What, Samuel Dockwrath? Oh, yes; I know him well enough; and to tell\nthe truth I do not think very well of him. Is he not a tenant of\nyours?\"\n\n\"Not at present.\" And then Lady Mason explained the manner in which\nthe two fields had been taken out of the lawyer's hands by her son's\norder.\n\n\"Ah! he was wrong there,\" said the baronet. \"When a man has held land\nso long it should not be taken away from him except under pressing\ncircumstances; that is if he pays his rent.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dockwrath did pay his rent, certainly; and now, I fear, he is\ndetermined to do all he can to injure us.\"\n\n\"But what injury can Mr. Dockwrath do you?\"\n\n\"I do not know, but he has gone down to Yorkshire,--to Mr. Mason's\nplace; I know that; and he was searching through some papers of old\nMr. Usbech's before he went. Indeed, I may say that I know as a\nfact that he has gone to Mr. Mason with the hope that these law\nproceedings may be brought on again.\"\n\n\"You know it as a fact?\"\n\n\"I think I may say so.\"\n\n\"But, dear Lady Mason, may I ask you how you know this as a fact?\"\n\n\"His wife was with me yesterday,\" she said, with some feeling of\nshame as she disclosed the source from whence she had obtained her\ninformation.\n\n\"And did she tell the tale against her own husband?\"\n\n\"Not as meaning to say anything against him, Sir Peregrine; you\nmust not think so badly of her as that; nor must you think that I\nwould willingly obtain information in such a manner. But you must\nunderstand that I have always been her friend; and when she found\nthat Mr. Dockwrath had left home on a matter in which I am so nearly\nconcerned, I cannot but think it natural that she should let me\nknow.\"\n\nTo this Sir Peregrine made no direct answer. He could not quite say\nthat he thought it was natural, nor could he give any expressed\napproval of any such intercourse between Lady Mason and the\nattorney's wife. He thought it would be better that Mr. Dockwrath\nshould be allowed to do his worst, if he had any intention of doing\nevil, and that Lady Mason should pass it by without condescending to\nnotice the circumstance. But he made allowances for her weakness, and\ndid not give utterance to his disapproval in words.\n\n\"I know you think that I have done wrong,\" she then said, appealing\nto him; and there was a tone of sorrow in her voice which went to his\nheart.\n\n\"No, not wrong; I cannot say that you have done wrong. It may be a\nquestion whether you have done wisely.\"\n\n\"Ah! if you only condemn my folly, I will not despair. It is probable\nI may not have done wisely, seeing that I had not you to direct me.\nBut what shall I do now? Oh, Sir Peregrine, say that you will not\ndesert me if all this trouble is coming on me again!\"\n\n\"No, I will not desert you, Lady Mason; you may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"Dearest friend!\"\n\n\"But I would advise you to take no notice whatever of Mr. Dockwrath\nand his proceedings. I regard him as a person entirely beneath your\nnotice, and if I were you I should not move at all in this matter\nunless I received some legal summons which made it necessary for me\nto do so. I have not the honour of any personal acquaintance with Mr.\nMason of Groby Park.\" It was in this way that Sir Peregrine always\ndesignated his friend's stepson--\"but if I understand the motives by\nwhich he may probably be actuated in this or in any other matter,\nI do not think it likely that he will expend money on so very\nunpromising a case.\"\n\n\"He would do anything for vengeance.\"\n\n\"I doubt if he would throw away his money even for that, unless he\nwere very sure of his prey. And in this matter, what can he possibly\ndo? He has the decision of the jury against him, and at the time he\nwas afraid to carry the case up to a court of appeal.\"\n\n\"But, Sir Peregrine, it is impossible to know what documents he may\nhave obtained since that.\"\n\n\"What documents can do you any harm;--unless, indeed, there should\nturn out to be a will subsequent to that under which your son\ninherits the property?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; there was no subsequent will.\"\n\n\"Of course there was not; and therefore you need not frighten\nyourself. It is just possible that some attempt may be made now that\nyour son is of age, but I regard even that as improbable.\"\n\n\"And you would not advise me then to say anything to Mr. Furnival?\"\n\n\"No; certainly not--unless you receive some legal notice which may\nmake it necessary for you to consult a lawyer. Do nothing; and if\nMrs. Dockwrath comes to you again, tell her that you are not disposed\nto take any notice of her information. Mrs. Dockwrath is, I am sure,\na very good sort of woman. Indeed I have always heard so. But, if\nI were you, I don't think that I should feel inclined to have much\nconversation with her about my private affairs. What you tell her you\ntell also to her husband.\" And then the baronet, having thus spoken\nwords of wisdom, sat silent in his arm-chair; and Lady Mason, still\nlooking into his face, remained silent also for a few minutes.\n\n\"I am so glad I asked you to come,\" she then said.\n\n\"I am delighted, if I have been of any service to you.\"\n\n\"Of any service! oh, Sir Peregrine, you cannot understand what it is\nto live alone as I do,--for of course I cannot trouble Lucius with\nthese matters; nor can a man, gifted as you are, comprehend how a\nwoman can tremble at the very idea that those law proceedings may\npossibly be repeated.\"\n\nSir Peregrine could not but remember as he looked at her that during\nall those law proceedings, when an attack was made, not only on her\nincome but on her honesty, she had never seemed to tremble. She had\nalways been constant to herself, even when things appeared to be\ngoing against her. But years passing over her head since that time\nhad perhaps told upon her courage.\n\n\"But I will fear nothing now, as you have promised that you will\nstill be my friend.\"\n\n\"You may be very sure of that, Lady Mason. I believe that I may\nfairly boast that I do not easily abandon those whom I have once\nregarded with esteem and affection; among whom Lady Mason will, I am\nsure, allow me to say that she is reckoned as by no means the least.\"\nAnd then taking her hand, the old gentleman bowed over it and kissed\nit.\n\n\"My dearest, dearest friend!\" said she; and lifting Sir Peregrine's\nbeautifully white hand to her lips she also kissed that. It will be\nremembered that the gentleman was over seventy, and that this pretty\nscene could therefore be enacted without impropriety on either side.\nSir Peregrine then went, and as he passed out of the door Lady\nMason smiled on him very sweetly. It is quite true that he was over\nseventy; but nevertheless the smile of a pretty woman still had\ncharms for him, more especially if there was a tear in her eye the\nwhile;--for Sir Peregrine Orme had a soft heart.\n\nAs soon as the door was closed behind him Lady Mason seated herself\nin her accustomed chair, and all trace of the smile vanished from her\nface. She was alone now, and could allow her countenance to be a true\nindex of her mind. If such was the case her heart surely was very\nsad. She sat there perfectly still for nearly an hour, and during the\nwhole of that time there was the same look of agony on her brow. Once\nor twice she rubbed her hands across her forehead, brushing back her\nhair, and showing, had there been any one by to see it, that there\nwas many a gray lock there mixed with the brown hairs. Had there been\nany one by, she would, it may be surmised, have been more careful.\n\nThere was no smile in her face now, neither was there any tear in her\neye. The one and the other emblem were equally alien to her present\nmood. But there was sorrow at her heart, and deep thought in her\nmind. She knew that her enemies were conspiring against her,--against\nher and against her son; and what steps might she best take in order\nthat she might baffle them?\n\n[Illustration: There was sorrow in her heart,\nand deep thought in her mind.]\n\n\"I have got that woman on the hip now.\" Those were the words which\nMr. Dockwrath had uttered into his wife's ears, after two days spent\nin searching through her father's papers. The poor woman had once\nthought of burning all those papers--in old days before she had\nbecome Mrs. Dockwrath. Her friend, Lady Mason, had counselled her\nto do so, pointing out to her that they were troublesome, and could\nby no possibility lead to profit; but she had consulted her lover,\nand he had counselled her to burn nothing. \"Would that she had been\nguided by her friend!\" she now said to herself with regard to that\nold trunk, and perhaps occasionally with regard to some other things.\n\n\"I have got that woman on the hip at last!\" and there had been a\ngleam of satisfaction in Samuel's eye as he uttered the words which\nhad convinced his wife that it was not an idle threat. She knew\nnothing of what the box had contained; and now, even if it had not\nbeen kept safe from her under Samuel's private key, the contents\nwhich were of interest had of course gone. \"I have business in the\nnorth, and shall be away for about a week,\" Mr. Dockwrath had said to\nher on the following morning.\n\n\"Oh, very well; then I'll put up your things,\" she had answered in\nher usual mild, sad, whining, household voice. Her voice at home was\nalways sad and whining, for she was overworked, and had too many\ncares, and her lord was a tyrant to her rather than a husband.\n\n\"Yes, I must see Mr. Mason immediately. And look here, Miriam, I\npositively insist that you do not go to Orley Farm, or hold any\nintercourse whatever with Lady Mason. D'ye hear?\"\n\nMrs. Dockwrath said that she did hear, and promised obedience. Mr.\nDockwrath probably guessed that the moment his back was turned all\nwould be told at the farm, and probably also had no real objection to\nher doing so. Had he in truth wished to keep his proceedings secret\nfrom Lady Mason he would not have divulged them to his wife. And then\nMr. Dockwrath did start for the north, bearing certain documents with\nhim; and soon after his departure Mrs. Dockwrath did pay a visit to\nOrley Farm.\n\nLady Mason sat there perfectly still for about an hour thinking what\nshe would do. She had asked Sir Peregrine, and had the advantage of\nhis advice; but that did not weigh much with her. What she wanted\nfrom Sir Peregrine was countenance and absolute assistance in the\nday of trouble,--not advice. She had desired to renew his interest\nin her favour, and to receive from him his assurance that he would\nnot desert her; and that she had obtained. It was of course also\nnecessary that she should consult him; but in turning over within her\nown mind this and that line of conduct, she did not, consciously,\nattach any weight to Sir Peregrine's opinion. The great question for\nher to decide was this;--should she put herself and her case into the\nhands of her friend Mr. Furnival now at once, or should she wait till\nshe had received some certain symptom of hostile proceedings? If she\ndid see Mr. Furnival, what could she tell him? Only this, that Mr.\nDockwrath had found some document among the papers of old Mr. Usbech,\nand had gone off with the same to Groby Park in Yorkshire. What that\ndocument might be she was as ignorant as the attorney's wife.\n\nWhen the hour was ended she had made up her mind that she would do\nnothing more in the matter, at any rate on that day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTHE COMMERCIAL ROOM, BULL INN, LEEDS.\n\n\nMr. Samuel Dockwrath was a little man, with sandy hair, a pale face,\nand stone-blue eyes. In judging of him by appearance only and not by\nthe ear, one would be inclined to doubt that he could be a very sharp\nattorney abroad and a very persistent tyrant at home. But when Mr.\nDockwrath began to talk, one's respect for him began to grow. He\ntalked well and to the point, and with a tone of voice that could\ncommand where command was possible, persuade where persuasion was\nrequired, mystify when mystification was needed, and express with\naccuracy the tone of an obedient humble servant when servility was\nthought to be expedient. We will now accompany him on his little tour\ninto Yorkshire.\n\nGroby Park is about seven miles from Leeds, and as Mr. Dockwrath had\nin the first instance to travel from Hamworth up to London, he did\nnot reach Leeds till late in the evening. It was a nasty, cold,\ndrizzling night, so that the beauties and marvels of the large\nmanufacturing town offered him no attraction, and at nine o'clock\nhe had seated himself before the fire in the commercial room at The\nBull, had called for a pair of public slippers, and was about to\nsolace all his cares with a glass of mahogany-coloured brandy and\nwater and a cigar. The room had no present occupant but himself, and\ntherefore he was able to make the most of all its comforts. He had\ntaken the solitary arm-chair, and had so placed himself that the gas\nwould fall direct from behind his head on to that day's \"Leeds and\nHalifax Chronicle,\" as soon as he should choose to devote himself to\nlocal politics.\n\nThe waiter had looked at him with doubtful eyes when he asked to be\nshown into the commercial room, feeling all but confident that such a\nguest had no right to be there. He had no bulky bundles of samples,\nnor any of those outward characteristics of a commercial \"gent\" with\nwhich all men conversant with the rail and road are acquainted, and\nwhich the accustomed eye of a waiter recognises at a glance. And\nhere it may be well to explain that ordinary travellers are in this\nrespect badly treated by the customs of England, or rather by the\nhotel-keepers. All inn-keepers have commercial rooms, as certainly\nas they have taps and bars, but all of them do not have commercial\nrooms in the properly exclusive sense. A stranger, therefore, who has\nasked for and obtained his mutton-chop in the commercial room of The\nDolphin, The Bear, and The George, not unnaturally asks to be shown\ninto the same chamber at the King's Head. But the King's Head does a\nbusiness with real commercials, and the stranger finds himself--out\nof his element.\n\n\"'Mercial, sir?\" said the waiter at The Bull Inn, Leeds, to Mr.\nDockwrath, in that tone of doubt which seemed to carry an answer to\nhis own question. But Mr. Dockwrath was not a man to be put down by\na waiter. \"Yes,\" said he. \"Didn't you hear me say so?\" And then the\nwaiter gave way. None of those lords of the road were in the house at\nthe moment, and it might be that none would come that night.\n\nMr. Dockwrath had arrived by the 8.22 P.M. down, but the 8.45 P.M. up\nfrom the north followed quick upon his heels, and he had hardly put\nhis brandy and water to his mouth before a rush and a sound of many\nvoices were heard in the hall. There is a great difference between\nthe entrance into an inn of men who are not known there and of\nmen who are known. The men who are not known are shy, diffident,\ndoubtful, and anxious to propitiate the chambermaid by great\ncourtesy. The men who are known are loud, jocular, and assured;--or\nelse, in case of deficient accommodation, loud, angry, and full of\nthreats. The guests who had now arrived were well known, and seemed\nat present to be in the former mood. \"Well, Mary, my dear, what's the\ntime of day with you?\" said a rough, bass voice, within the hearing\nof Mr. Dockwrath. \"Much about the old tune, Mr. Moulder,\" said the\ngirl at the bar. \"Time to look alive and keep moving. Will you have\nthem boxes up stairs, Mr. Kantwise?\" and then there were a few words\nabout the luggage, and two real commercial gentlemen walked into the\nroom.\n\nMr. Dockwrath resolved to stand upon his rights, so he did not move\nhis chair, but looked up over his shoulder at the new comers. The\nfirst man who entered was short and very fat;--so fat that he could\nnot have seen his own knees for some considerable time past. His face\nrolled with fat, as also did all his limbs. His eyes were large, and\nbloodshot. He wore no beard, and therefore showed plainly the triple\nbagging of his fat chin. In spite of his overwhelming fatness, there\nwas something in his face that was masterful and almost vicious. His\nbody had been overcome by eating, but not as yet his spirit--one\nwould be inclined to say. This was Mr. Moulder, well known on the\nroad as being in the grocery and spirit line; a pushing man, who\nunderstood his business, and was well trusted by his firm in spite of\nhis habitual intemperance. What did the firm care whether or no he\nkilled himself by eating and drinking? He sold his goods, collected\nhis money, and made his remittances. If he got drunk at night that\nwas nothing to them, seeing that he always did his quota of work the\nnext day. But Mr. Moulder did not get drunk. His brandy and water\nwent into his blood, and into his eyes, and into his feet, and into\nhis hands,--but not into his brain.\n\nThe other was a little square man in the hardware line, of the name\nof Kantwise. He disposed of fire-irons, grates, ovens, and kettles,\nand was at the present moment heavily engaged in the sale of certain\nnewly-invented metallic tables and chairs lately brought out by the\nPatent Steel Furniture Company, for which Mr. Kantwise did business.\nHe looked as though a skin rather too small for the purpose had been\ndrawn over his head and face so that his forehead and cheeks and chin\nwere tight and shiny. His eyes were small and green, always moving\nabout in his head, and were seldom used by Mr. Kantwise in the\nordinary way. At whatever he looked he looked sideways; it was not\nthat he did not look you in the face, but he always looked at you\nwith a sidelong glance, never choosing to have you straight in front\nof him. And the more eager he was in conversation--the more anxious\nhe might be to gain his point, the more he averted his face and\nlooked askance; so that sometimes he would prefer to have his\nantagonist almost behind his shoulder. And then as he did this, he\nwould thrust forward his chin, and having looked at you round the\ncorner till his eyes were nearly out of his head, he would close\nthem both and suck in his lips, and shake his head with rapid little\nshakes, as though he were saying to himself, \"Ah, sir! you're a bad\nun, a very bad un.\" His nose--for I should do Mr. Kantwise injustice\nif I did not mention this feature--seemed to have been compressed\nalmost into nothing by that skin-squeezing operation. It was long\nenough, taking the measurement down the bridge, and projected\nsufficiently, counting the distance from the upper lip; but it had\nall the properties of a line; it possessed length without breadth.\nThere was nothing in it from side to side. If you essayed to pull it,\nyour fingers would meet. When I shall have also said that the hair\non Mr. Kantwise's head stood up erect all round to the height of two\ninches, and that it was very red, I shall have been accurate enough\nin his personal description.\n\nThat Mr. Moulder represented a firm good business, doing tea, coffee,\nand British brandy on a well-established basis of capital and profit,\nthe travelling commercial world in the north of England was well\naware. No one entertained any doubt about his employers, Hubbles and\nGrease of Houndsditch. Hubbles and Grease were all right, as they had\nbeen any time for the last twenty years. But I cannot say that there\nwas quite so strong a confidence felt in the Patent Steel Furniture\nCompany generally, or in the individual operations of Mr. Kantwise\nin particular. The world in Yorkshire and Lancashire was doubtful\nabout metallic tables, and it was thought that Mr. Kantwise was too\neloquent in their praise.\n\nMr. Moulder when he had entered the room, stood still, to enable\nthe waiter to peel off from him his greatcoat and the large shawl\nwith which his neck was enveloped, and Mr. Kantwise performed the\nsame operation for himself, carefully folding up the articles of\nclothing as he took them off. Then Mr. Moulder fixed his eyes on Mr.\nDockwrath, and stared at him very hard. \"Who's the party, James?\" he\nsaid to the waiter, speaking in a whisper that was plainly heard by\nthe attorney.\n\n\"Gen'elman by the 8.22 down,\" said James.\n\n\"Commercial?\" asked Mr. Moulder, with angry frown.\n\n\"He says so himself, anyways,\" said the waiter.\n\n\"Gammon!\" replied Mr. Moulder, who knew all the bearings of a\ncommercial man thoroughly, and could have put one together if he were\nonly supplied with a little bit--say the mouth, as Professor Owen\nalways does with the Dodoes. Mr. Moulder now began to be angry, for\nhe was a stickler for the rights and privileges of his class, and had\nan idea that the world was not so conservative in that respect as it\nshould be. Mr. Dockwrath, however, was not to be frightened, so he\ndrew his chair a thought nearer to the fire, took a sup of brandy and\nwater, and prepared himself for war if war should be necessary.\n\n\"Cold evening, sir, for the time of year,\" said Mr. Moulder, walking\nup to the fireplace, and rolling the lumps of his forehead about in\nhis attempt at a frown. In spite of his terrible burden of flesh, Mr.\nMoulder could look angry on occasions, but he could only do so when\nhe was angry. He was not gifted with a command of his facial muscles.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, not taking his eyes from off the Leeds\nand Halifax Chronicle. \"It is coldish. Waiter, bring me a cigar.\"\n\nThis was very provoking, as must be confessed. Mr. Moulder had not\nbeen prepared to take any step towards turning the gentleman out,\nthough doubtless he might have done so had he chosen to exercise\nhis prerogative. But he did expect that the gentleman would have\nacknowledged the weakness of his footing, by moving himself a little\ntowards one side of the fire, and he did not expect that he would\nhave presumed to smoke without asking whether the practice was\nheld to be objectionable by the legal possessors of the room. Mr.\nDockwrath was free of any such pusillanimity. \"Waiter,\" he said\nagain, \"bring me a cigar, d'ye hear?\"\n\nThe great heart of Moulder could not stand this unmoved. He had been\nan accustomed visitor to that room for fifteen years, and had always\ndone his best to preserve the commercial code unsullied. He was now\nso well known, that no one else ever presumed to take the chair\nat the four o'clock commercial dinner if he were present. It was\nincumbent on him to stand forward and make a fight, more especially\nin the presence of Kantwise, who was by no means stanch to his order.\nKantwise would at all times have been glad to have outsiders in the\nroom, in order that he might puff his tables, and if possible effect\na sale;--a mode of proceeding held in much aversion by the upright,\nold-fashioned, commercial mind.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Moulder, having become very red about the cheeks and\nchin, \"I and this gentleman are going to have a bit of supper, and it\nain't accustomed to smoke in commercial rooms during meals. You know\nthe rules no doubt if you're commercial yourself;--as I suppose you\nare, seeing you in this room.\"\n\nNow Mr. Moulder was wrong in his law, as he himself was very well\naware. Smoking is allowed in all commercial rooms when the dinner has\nbeen some hour or so off the table. But then it was necessary that he\nshould hit the stranger in some way, and the chances were that the\nstranger would know nothing about commercial law. Nor did he; so he\nmerely looked Mr. Moulder hard in the face. But Mr. Kantwise knew the\nlaws well enough, and as he saw before him a possible purchaser of\nmetallic tables, he came to the assistance of the attorney.\n\n\"I think you are a little wrong there, Mr. Moulder; eh; ain't you?\"\nsaid he.\n\n\"Wrong about what?\" said Moulder, turning very sharply upon his\nbase-minded compatriot.\n\n\"Well, as to smoking. It's nine o'clock, and if the gentleman--\"\n\n\"I don't care a brass farthing about the clock,\" said the other, \"but\nwhen I'm going to have a bit of steak with my tea, in my own room, I\nchooses to have it comfortable.\"\n\n\"Goodness me, Mr. Moulder, how many times have I seen you sitting\nthere with a pipe in your mouth, and half a dozen gents eating their\nteas the while in this very room? The rule of the case I take it to\nbe this; when--\"\n\n\"Bother your rules.\"\n\n\"Well; it was you spoke of them.\"\n\n\"The question I take to be this,\" said Moulder, now emboldened by\nthe opposition he had received. \"Has the gentleman any right to\nbe in this room at all, or has he not? Is he commercial, or is\nhe--miscellaneous? That's the chat, as I take it.\"\n\n\"You're on the square there, I must allow,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"James,\" said Moulder, appealing with authority to the waiter, who\nhad remained in the room during the controversy;--and now Mr. Moulder\nwas determined to do his duty and vindicate his profession, let\nthe consequences be what they might. \"James, is that gentleman\ncommercial, or is he not?\"\n\nIt was clearly necessary now that Mr. Dockwrath himself should take\nhis own part, and fight his own battle. \"Sir,\" said he, turning to\nMr. Moulder, \"I think you'll find it extremely difficult to define\nthat word;--extremely difficult. In this enterprising country all men\nare more or less commercial.\"\n\n\"Hear! hear!\" said Mr. Kantwise.\n\n\"That's gammon,\" said Mr. Moulder.\n\n\"Gammon it may be,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, \"but nevertheless it's\nright in law. Taking the word in its broadest, strictest, and most\nintelligible sense, I am a commercial gentleman; and as such I do\nmaintain that I have a full right to the accommodation of this public\nroom.\"\n\n\"That's very well put,\" said Mr. Kantwise.\n\n\"Waiter,\" thundered out Mr. Moulder, as though he imagined that that\nfunctionary was down the yard at the taproom instead of standing\nwithin three feet of his elbow. \"Is this gent a commercial, or is he\nnot? Because if not,--then I'll trouble you to send Mr. Crump here.\nMy compliments to Mr. Crump, and I wish to see him.\" Now Mr. Crump\nwas the landlord of the Bull Inn.\n\n\"Master's just stepped out, down the street,\" said James.\n\n\"Why don't you answer my question, sir?\" said Moulder, becoming\nredder and still more red about his shirt-collars.\n\n\"The gent said as how he was 'mercial,\" said the poor man. \"Was I to\ngo to contradict a gent and tell him he wasn't when he said as how he\nwas?\"\n\n\"If you please,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, \"we will not bring the waiter\ninto this discussion. I asked for the commercial room, and he did his\nduty in showing me to the door of it. The fact I take to be this; in\nthe south of England the rules to which you refer are not kept so\nstrictly as in these more mercantile localities.\"\n\n\"I've always observed that,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"I travelled for three years in Devonshire, Somersetshire, and\nWiltshire,\" said Moulder, \"and the commercial rooms were as well kept\nthere as any I ever see.\"\n\n\"I alluded to Surrey and Kent,\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"They're uncommonly miscellaneous in Surrey and Kent,\" said Kantwise.\n\"There's no doubt in the world about that.\"\n\n\"If the gentleman means to say that he's come in here because he\ndidn't know the custom of the country, I've no more to say, of\ncourse,\" said Moulder. \"And in that case, I, for one, shall be very\nhappy if the gentleman cam make himself comfortable in this room as a\nstranger, and I may say guest;--paying his own shot, of course.\"\n\n\"And as for me, I shall be delighted,\" said Kantwise. \"I never did\nlike too much exclusiveness. What's the use of bottling oneself up?\nthat's what I always say. Besides, there's no charity in it. We gents\nas are always on the road should show a little charity to them as\nain't so well accustomed to the work.\"\n\nAt this allusion to charity Mr. Moulder snuffled through his nose to\nshow his great disgust, but he made no further answer. Mr. Dockwrath,\nwho was determined not to yield, but who had nothing to gain by\nfurther fighting, bowed his head, and declared that he felt very much\nobliged. Whether or no there was any touch of irony in his tone, Mr.\nMoulder's ears were not fine enough to discover. So they now sat\nround the fire together, the attorney still keeping his seat in the\nmiddle. And then Mr. Moulder ordered his little bit of steak with his\ntea. \"With the gravy in it, James,\" he said, solemnly. \"And a bit\nof fat, and a few slices of onion, thin mind, put on raw, not with\nall the taste fried out; and tell the cook if she don't do it as\nit should be done, I'll be down into the kitchen and do it myself.\nYou'll join me, Kantwise, eh?\"\n\n\"Well, I think not; I dined at three, you know.\"\n\n\"Dined at three! What of that? a dinner at three won't last a man for\never. You might as well join me.\"\n\n\"No, I think not. Have you got such a thing as a nice red herring in\nthe house, James?\"\n\n\"Get one round the corner, sir.\"\n\n\"Do, there's a good fellow; and I'll take it for a relish with my\ntea. I'm not so fond of your solids three times a day. They heat the\nblood too much.\"\n\n\"Bother,\" grunted Moulder; and then they went to their evening meal,\nover which we will not disturb them. The steak, we may presume, was\ncooked aright, as Mr. Moulder did not visit the kitchen, and Mr.\nKantwise no doubt made good play with his unsubstantial dainty, as he\nspoke no further till his meal was altogether finished.\n\n\"Did you ever hear anything of that Mr. Mason who lives near\nBradford?\" asked Mr. Kantwise, addressing himself to Mr. Moulder, as\nsoon as the things had been cleared from the table, and that latter\ngentleman had been furnished with a pipe and a supply of cold\nwithout.\n\n\"I remember his father when I was a boy,\" said Moulder, not troubling\nhimself to take his pipe from his mouth, \"Mason and Martock in the\nOld Jewry; very good people they were too.\"\n\n\"He's decently well off now, I suppose, isn't he?\" said Kantwise,\nturning away his face, and looking at his companion out of the\ncorners of his eyes.\n\n\"I suppose he is. That place there by the road-side is all his own, I\ntake it. Have you been at him with some of your rusty, rickety tables\nand chairs?\"\n\n\"Mr. Moulder, you forget that there is a gentleman here who won't\nunderstand that you're at your jokes. I was doing business at Groby\nPark, but I found the party uncommon hard to deal with.\"\n\n\"Didn't complete the transaction?\"\n\n\"Well, no; not exactly; but I intend to call again. He's close enough\nhimself, is Mr. Mason. But his lady, Mrs. M.! Lord love you, Mr.\nMoulder, that is a woman!\"\n\n\"She is; is she? As for me, I never have none of these private\ndealings. It don't suit my book at all; nor it ain't what I've been\naccustomed to. If a man's wholesale, let him be wholesale.\" And then,\nhaving enunciated this excellent opinion with much energy, he took a\nlong pull at his brandy and water.\n\n\"Very old fashioned, Mr. Moulder,\" said Kantwise, looking round the\ncorner, then shutting his eyes and shaking his head.\n\n\"May be,\" said Moulder, \"and yet none the worse for that. I call it\nhawking and peddling, that going round the country with your goods\non your back. It ain't trade.\" And then there was a lull in the\nconversation, Mr. Kantwise, who was a very religious gentleman,\nhaving closed his eyes, and being occupied with some internal\nanathema against Mr. Moulder.\n\n\"Begging your pardon, sir, I think you were talking about one Mr.\nMason who lives in these parts,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"Exactly. Joseph Mason, Esq., of Groby Park,\" said Mr. Kantwise, now\nturning his face upon the attorney.\n\n\"I suppose I shall be likely to find him at home to-morrow, if I\ncall?\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir; certainly; leastwise I should say so. Any personal\nacquaintance with Mr. Mason, sir? If so, I meant nothing offensive by\nmy allusion to the lady, sir; nothing at all, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"The lady's nothing to me, sir; nor the gentleman either;--only that\nI have a little business with him.\"\n\n\"Shall be very happy to join you in a gig, sir, to-morrow, as far\nas Groby Park; or fly, if more convenient. I shall only take a few\npatterns with me, and they're no weight at all,--none in the least,\nsir. They go on behind, and you wouldn't know it, sir.\" To this,\nhowever, Mr. Dockwrath would not assent. As he wanted to see Mr.\nMason very specially, he should go early, and preferred going by\nhimself.\n\n\"No offence, I hope,\" said Mr. Kantwise.\n\n\"None in the least,\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"And if you would allow me, sir, to have the pleasure of showing you\na few of my patterns, I'm sure I should be delighted.\" This he said\nobserving that Mr. Moulder was sitting over his empty glass with the\npipe in his hand, and his eyes fast closed. \"I think, sir, I could\nshow you an article that would please you very much. You see, sir,\nthat new ideas are coming in every day, and wood, sir, is altogether\ngoing out,--altogether going out as regards furniture. In another\ntwenty years, sir, there won't be such a thing as a wooden table\nin the country, unless with some poor person that can't afford to\nrefurnish. Believe me, sir, iron's the thing now-a-days.\"\n\n\"And indian-rubber,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"Yes; indian-rubber's wonderful too. Are you in that line, sir?\"\n\n\"Well; no; not exactly.\"\n\n\"It's not like iron, sir. You can't make a dinner-table for fourteen\npeople out of indian-rubber, that will shut up into a box 3-6 by\n2-4 deep, and 2-6 broad. Why, sir, I can let you have a set of\ndrawing-room furniture for fifteen ten that you've never seen\nequalled in wood for three times the money;--ornamented in the\ntastiest way, sir, and fit for any lady's drawing-room or boodoor.\nThe ladies of quality are all getting them now for their boodoors.\nThere's three tables, eight chairs, easy rocking-chair, music-stand,\nstool to match, and pair of stand-up screens, all gilt in real Louey\ncatorse; and it goes in three boxes 4-2 by 2-1 and 2-3. Think of\nthat, sir. For fifteen ten and the boxes in.\" Then there was a pause,\nafter which Mr. Kantwise added--\"If ready money, the carriage paid.\"\nAnd then he turned his head very much away, and looked back very hard\nat his expected customer.\n\n\"I'm afraid the articles are not in my line,\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"It's the tastiest present for a gentleman to make to his lady that\nhas come out since--since those sort of things have come out at\nall. You'll let me show you the articles, sir. It will give me the\nsincerest pleasure.\" And Mr. Kantwise proposed to leave the room in\norder that he might introduce the three boxes in question.\n\n\"They would not be at all in my way,\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"The trouble would be nothing,\" said Mr. Kantwise, \"and it gives me\nthe greatest pleasure to make them known when I find any one who\ncan appreciate such undoubted luxuries;\" and so saying Mr. Kantwise\nskipped out of the room, and soon returned with James and Boots, each\nof the three bearing on his shoulder a deal box nearly as big as a\ncoffin, all of which were deposited in different parts of the room.\nMr. Moulder in the meantime snored heavily, his head falling on to\nhis breast every now and again. But nevertheless he held fast by his\npipe.\n\nMr. Kantwise skipped about the room with wonderful agility,\nunfastening the boxes, and taking out the contents, while Joe the\nboots and James the waiter stood by assisting. They had never yet\nseen the glories of these chairs and tables, and were therefore\nnot unwilling to be present. It was singular to see how ready\nMr. Kantwise was at the work, how recklessly he threw aside the\nwhitey-brown paper in which the various pieces of painted iron were\nenveloped, and with what a practised hand he put together one article\nafter another. First there was a round loo-table, not quite so large\nin its circumference as some people might think desirable, but,\nnevertheless, a round loo-table. The pedestal with its three claws\nwas all together. With a knowing touch Mr. Kantwise separated the\nbottom of what looked like a yellow stick, and, lo! there were three\nlegs, which he placed carefully on the ground. Then a small bar was\nscrewed on to the top, and over the bar was screwed the leaf, or\ntable itself, which consisted of three pieces unfolding with hinges.\nThese, when the screw had been duly fastened in the centre, opened\nout upon the bar, and there was the table complete.\n\nIt was certainly a \"tasty\" article, and the pride with which Mr.\nKantwise glanced back at it was quite delightful. The top of the\ntable was blue, with a red bird of paradise in the middle; and the\nedges of the table, to the breadth of a couple of inches, were\nyellow. The pillar also was yellow, as were the three legs. \"It's the\nreal Louey catorse,\" said Mr. Kantwise, stooping down to go on with\ntable number two, which was, as he described it, a \"chess,\" having\nthe proper number of blue and light-pink squares marked upon it; but\nthis also had been made Louey catorse with reference to its legs and\nedges. The third table was a \"sofa,\" of proper shape, but rather\nsmall in size. Then, one after another, he brought forth and screwed\nup the chairs, stools, and sundry screens, and within a quarter of an\nhour he had put up the whole set complete. The red bird of paradise\nand the blue ground appeared on all, as did also the yellow legs and\nedgings which gave to them their peculiarly fashionable character.\n\"There,\" said Mr. Kantwise, looking at them with fond admiration, \"I\ndon't mind giving a personal guarantee that there's nothing equal to\nthat for the money either in England or in France.\"\n\n\"They are very nice,\" said Mr. Dockwrath. When a man has had produced\nbefore him for his own and sole delectation any article or articles,\nhow can he avoid eulogium? Mr. Dockwrath found himself obliged to\npause, and almost feared that he should find himself obliged to buy.\n\n\"Nice! I should rather think they are,\" said Mr. Kantwise, becoming\ntriumphant,--\"and for fifteen ten, delivered, boxes included. There's\nnothing like iron, sir, nothing; you may take my word for that.\nThey're so strong, you know. Look here, sir.\" And then Mr. Kantwise,\ntaking two of the pieces of whitey-brown paper which had been laid\naside, carefully spread one on the centre of the round table, and the\nother on the seat of one of the chairs. Then lightly poising himself\non his toe, he stepped on to the chair, and from thence on to the\ntable. In that position he skillfully brought his feet together,\nso that his weight was directly on the leg, and gracefully waved\nhis hands over his head. James and Boots stood by admiring, with\nopen mouths, and Mr. Dockwrath, with his hands in his pockets, was\nmeditating whether he could not give the order without complying with\nthe terms as to ready money.\n\n[Illustration: \"There is nothing like iron, Sir; nothing.\"]\n\n\"Look at that for strength,\" said Mr. Kantwise from his exalted\nposition. \"I don't think any lady of your acquaintance, sir, would\nallow you to stand on her rosewood or mahogany loo-table. And if she\ndid, you would not like to adventure it yourself. But look at this\nfor strength,\" and he waved his arms abroad, still keeping his feet\nskilfully together in the same exact position.\n\nAt that moment Mr. Moulder awoke. \"So you've got your iron traps out,\nhave you?\" said he. \"What; you're there, are you? Upon my word I'd\nsooner you than me.\"\n\n\"I certainly should not like to see you up here, Mr. Moulder. I doubt\nwhether even this table would bear five-and-twenty stone. Joe, lend\nme your shoulder, there's a good fellow.\" And then Mr. Kantwise,\nbearing very lightly on the chair, descended to the ground without\naccident.\n\n\"Now, that's what I call gammon,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"What is gammon, Mr. Moulder?\" said the other, beginning to be angry.\n\n\"It's all gammon. The chairs and tables is gammon, and so is the\nstools and the screens.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moulder, I didn't call your tea and coffee and brandy gammon.\"\n\n\"You can't; and you wouldn't do any harm if you did. Hubbles and\nGrease are too well known in Yorkshire for you to hurt them. But as\nfor all that show-off and gimcrack-work, I tell you fairly it ain't\nwhat I call trade, and it ain't fit for a commercial room. It's\ngammon, gammon, gammon! James, give me a bedcandle.\" And so Mr.\nMoulder took himself off to bed.\n\n\"I think I'll go too,\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"You'll let me put you up the set, eh?\" said Mr. Kantwise.\n\n\"Well; I'll think about it,\" said the attorney. \"I'll not just give\nyou an answer to-night. Good night, sir; I'm very much obliged to\nyou.\" And he too went, leaving Mr. Kantwise to repack his chairs and\ntables with the assistance of James the waiter.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE MASONS OF GROBY PARK.\n\n\nGroby Park is about seven miles from Leeds, in the direction of\nBradford, and thither on the morning after the scene described in the\nlast chapter Mr. Dockwrath was driven in one of the gigs belonging\nto the Bull Inn. The park itself is spacious, but is flat and\nuninteresting, being surrounded by a thin belt of new-looking\nfir-trees, and containing but very little old or handsome timber.\nThere are on the high road two very important lodges, between which\nis a large ornamented gate, and from thence an excellent road leads\nto the mansion, situated in the very middle of the domain. The house\nis Greek in its style of architecture,--at least so the owner says;\nand if a portico with a pediment and seven Ionic columns makes a\nhouse Greek, the house in Groby Park undoubtedly is Greek.\n\nHere lived Mr. and Mrs. Mason, the three Misses Mason, and\noccasionally the two young Messrs. Mason; for the master of Groby\nPark was blessed with five children. He himself was a big, broad,\nheavy-browed man, in whose composition there was nothing of\ntenderness, nothing of poetry, and nothing of taste; but I cannot say\nthat he was on the whole a bad man. He was just in his dealings, or\nat any rate endeavoured to be so. He strove hard to do his duty as a\ncounty magistrate against very adverse circumstances. He endeavoured\nto enable his tenants and labourers to live. He was severe to his\nchildren, and was not loved by them; but nevertheless they were dear\nto him, and he endeavoured to do his duty by them. The wife of his\nbosom was not a pleasant woman, but nevertheless he did his duty by\nher; that is, he neither deserted her, nor beat her, nor locked her\nup. I am not sure that he would not have been justified in doing one\nof these three things, or even all the three; for Mrs. Mason of Groby\nPark was not a pleasant woman.\n\nBut yet he was a bad man in that he could never forget and never\nforgive. His mind and heart were equally harsh and hard and\ninflexible. He was a man who considered that it behoved him as a man\nto resent all injuries, and to have his pound of flesh in all cases.\nIn his inner thoughts he had ever boasted to himself that he had\npaid all men all that he owed. He had, so he thought, injured no\none in any of the relations of life. His tradesmen got their money\nregularly. He answered every man's letter. He exacted nothing from\nany man for which he did not pay. He never ill-used a servant either\nby bad language or by over-work. He never amused himself, but devoted\nhis whole time to duties. He would fain even have been hospitable,\ncould he have gotten his neighbours to come to him and have induced\nhis wife to put upon the table sufficient food for them to eat.\n\nSuch being his virtues, what right had any one to injure him? When he\ngot from his grocer adulterated coffee,--he analyzed the coffee, as\nhis half-brother had done the guano,--he would have flayed the man\nalive if the law would have allowed him. Had he not paid the man\nmonthly, giving him the best price as though for the best article?\nWhen he was taken in with a warranty for a horse, he pursued the\nculprit to the uttermost. Maid-servants who would not come from their\nbedrooms at six o'clock, he would himself disturb while enjoying\ntheir stolen slumbers. From his children he exacted all titles of\nrespect, because he had a right to them. He wanted nothing that\nbelonged to any one else, but he could not endure that aught should\nbe kept from him which he believed to be his own. It may be imagined,\ntherefore, in what light he esteemed Lady Mason and her son, and how\nhe regarded their residence at Orley Farm, seeing that he firmly\nbelieved that Orley Farm was his own, if all the truth were known.\n\nI have already hinted that Mrs. Mason was not a delightful woman.\nShe had been a beauty, and still imagined that she had not lost all\npretension to be so considered. She spent, therefore, a considerable\nportion of her day in her dressing-room, spent a great deal of money\nfor clothes, and gave herself sundry airs. She was a little woman\nwith long eyes, and regular eyelashes, with a straight nose, and thin\nlips and regular teeth. Her face was oval, and her hair was brown.\nIt had at least once been all brown, and that which was now seen was\nbrown also. But, nevertheless, although she was possessed of all\nthese charms, you might look at her for ten days together, and on the\neleventh you would not know her if you met her in the streets.\n\nBut the appearance of Mrs. Mason was not her forte. She had been a\nbeauty; but if it had been her lot to be known in history, it was not\nas a beauty that she would have been famous. Parsimony was her great\nvirtue, and a power of saving her strong point. I have said that she\nspent much money in dress, and some people will perhaps think that\nthe two points of character are not compatible. Such people know\nnothing of a true spirit of parsimony. It is from the backs and\nbellies of other people that savings are made with the greatest\nconstancy and the most satisfactory results.\n\nThe parsimony of a mistress of a household is best displayed on\nmatters eatable;--on matters eatable and drinkable; for there is a\nfine scope for domestic savings in tea, beer, and milk. And in such\nmatters chiefly did Mrs. Mason operate, going as far as she dared\ntowards starving even her husband. But nevertheless she would feed\nherself in the middle of the day, having a roast fowl with bread\nsauce in her own room. The miser who starves himself and dies without\nan ounce of flesh on his bones, while his skinny head lies on a bag\nof gold, is after all, respectable. There has been a grand passion\nin his life, and that grandest work of man, self-denial. You cannot\naltogether despise one who has clothed himself with rags and fed\nhimself with bone-scrapings, while broadcloth and ortolans were\nwithin his easy reach. But there are women, wives and mothers of\nfamilies, who would give the bone-scrapings to their husbands and the\nbones to their servants, while they hide the ortolans for themselves;\nand would dress children in rags, while they cram chests, drawers,\nand boxes with silks and satins for their own backs. Such a woman\none can thoroughly despise, and even hate; and such a woman was Mrs.\nMason of Groby Park.\n\nI shall not trouble the reader at present with much description of\nthe young Masons. The eldest son was in the army, and the younger at\nCambridge, both spending much more money than their father allowed\nthem. Not that he, in this respect, was specially close-fisted. He\nascertained what was sufficient,--amply sufficient as he was told by\nthe colonel of the regiment and the tutor of the college,--and that\namount he allowed, assuring both Joseph and John that if they spent\nmore, they would themselves have to pay for it out of the moneys\nwhich should enrich them in future years. But how could the sons\nof such a mother be other than spendthrifts? Of course they were\nextravagant; of course they spent more than they should have done;\nand their father resolved that he would keep his word with them\nreligiously.\n\nThe daughters were much less fortunate, having no possible means of\nextravagance allowed to them. Both the father and mother decided\nthat they should go out into the county society, and therefore their\nclothing was not absolutely of rags. But any young lady who does go\ninto society, whether it be of county or town, will fully understand\nthe difference between a liberal and a stingy wardrobe. Girls with\nslender provisions of millinery may be fit to go out,--quite fit in\ntheir father's eyes; and yet all such going out may be matter of\nintense pain. It is all very well for the world to say that a girl\nshould be happy without reference to her clothes. Show me such a\ngirl, and I will show you one whom I should be very sorry that a boy\nof mine should choose as his sweetheart.\n\nThe three Misses Mason, as they always were called by the Groby Park\npeople, had been christened Diana, Creusa, and Penelope, their mother\nhaving a passion for classic literature, which she indulged by a use\nof Lempri\u00c3\u00a8re's dictionary. They were not especially pretty, nor were\nthey especially plain. They were well grown and healthy, and quite\ncapable of enjoying themselves in any of the amusements customary to\nyoung ladies,--if only the opportunities were afforded them.\n\nMr. Dockwrath had thought it well to write to Mr. Mason, acquainting\nthat gentleman with his intended visit. Mr. Mason, he said to\nhimself, would recognise his name, and know whence he came, and under\nsuch circumstances would be sure to see him, although the express\npurpose of the proposed interview should not have been explained to\nhim. Such in result was exactly the case. Mr. Mason did remember the\nname of Dockwrath, though he had never hitherto seen the bearer of\nit; and as the letter was dated from Hamworth, he felt sufficient\ninterest in the matter to await at home the coming of his visitor.\n\n\"I know your name, Mr. Mason, sir, and have known it long,\" said Mr.\nDockwrath, seating himself in the chair which was offered to him in\nthe magistrate's study; \"though I never had the pleasure of seeing\nyou before,--to my knowledge. My name is Dockwrath, sir, and I am a\nsolicitor. I live at Hamworth, and I married the daughter of old Mr.\nUsbech, sir, whom you will remember.\"\n\nMr. Mason listened attentively as these details were uttered before\nhim so clearly, but he said nothing, merely bowing his head at each\nseparate statement. He knew all about old Usbech's daughter nearly as\nwell as Mr. Dockwrath did himself, but he was a man who knew how to\nbe silent upon occasions.\n\n\"I was too young, sir,\" continued Dockwrath, \"when you had that trial\nabout Orley Farm to have anything to do with the matter myself,\nbut nevertheless I remember all the circumstances as though it was\nyesterday. I suppose, sir, you remember them also?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Dockwrath, I remember them very well.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, my impression has always been that--\" And then the\nattorney stopped. It was quite his intention to speak out plainly\nbefore Mr. Mason, but he was anxious that that gentleman should speak\nout too. At any rate it might be well that he should be induced to\nexpress some little interest in the matter.\n\n\"Your impression, you say, has always been--\" said Mr. Mason,\nrepeating the words of his companion, and looking as ponderous and\ngrave as ever. His countenance, however, expressed nothing but his\nusual ponderous solemnity.\n\n\"My impression always was--that there was something that had not been\nas yet found out.\"\n\n\"What sort of thing, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"Well; some secret. I don't think that your lawyers managed the\nmatter well, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"You think you would have done it better, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"I don't say that, Mr. Mason. I was only a lad at the time, and could\nnot have managed it at all. But they didn't ferret about enough. Mr.\nMason, there's a deal better evidence than any that is given by word\nof mouth. A clever counsel can turn a witness pretty nearly any way\nhe likes, but he can't do that with little facts. He hasn't the time,\nyou see, to get round them. Your lawyers, sir, didn't get up the\nlittle facts as they should have done.\"\n\n\"And you have got them up since, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"I don't say that, Mr. Mason. You see all my interest lies in\nmaintaining the codicil. My wife's fortune came to her under that\ndeed. To be sure that's gone and spent long since, and the Lord\nChancellor with all the judges couldn't enforce restitution; but,\nnevertheless, I wouldn't wish that any one should have a claim\nagainst me on that account.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you will not object to say what it is that you do wish?\"\n\n\"I wish to see right done, Mr. Mason; that's all. I don't think that\nLady Mason or her son have any right to the possession of that place.\nI don't think that that codicil was a correct instrument; and in that\ncase of Mason versus Mason I don't think that you and your friends\ngot to the bottom of it.\" And then Mr. Dockwrath leaned back in his\nchair with an inward determination to say nothing more, until Mr.\nMason should make some sign.\n\nThat gentleman, however, still remained ponderous and heavy, and\ntherefore there was a short period of silence--\"And have you got to\nthe bottom of it since, Mr. Dockwrath?\" at last he said.\n\n\"I don't say that I have,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"Might I ask then what it is you propose to effect by the visit with\nwhich you have honoured me? Of course you are aware that these are\nvery private matters; and although I should feel myself under an\nobligation to you, or to any man who might assist me to arrive at any\ntrue facts which have hitherto been concealed, I am not disposed to\ndiscuss the affair with a stranger on grounds of mere suspicion.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't have come here, Mr. Mason, at very great expense, and\npersonal inconvenience to myself in my profession, if I had not some\ngood reason for doing so. I don't think that you ever got to the\nbottom of that matter, and I can't say that I have done so now; I\nhaven't even tried. But I tell you what, Mr. Mason; if you wish it, I\nthink I could put you in the way of--trying.\"\n\n\"My lawyers are Messrs. Round and Crook of Bedford Row. Will it not\nbe better that you should go to them, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Mason. I don't think it will be better that I should go\nto them. I know Round and Crook well, and don't mean to say a word\nagainst them; but if I go any farther into this affair I must do\nit with the principal. I am not going to cut my own throat for the\nsake of mending any man's little finger. I have a family of sixteen\nchildren, Mr. Mason, and I have to look about very sharp,--very sharp\nindeed.\" Then there was another pause, and Mr. Dockwrath began to\nperceive that Mr. Mason was not by nature an open, demonstrative, or\ncommunicative man. If anything further was to be done, he himself\nmust open out a little. \"The fact is, Mr. Mason, that I have come\nacross documents which you should have had at that trial. Round and\nCrook ought to have had them, only they weren't half sharp. Why, sir,\nMr. Usbech had been your father's man of business for years upon\nyears, and yet they didn't half go through his papers. They turned\n'em over and looked at 'em; but never thought of seeing what little\nfacts might be proved.\"\n\n\"And these documents are with you now, here?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Mason, I am not so soft as that. I never carry about\noriginal documents unless when ordered to prove. Copies of one or two\nitems I have made; not regular copies, Mr. Mason, but just a line or\ntwo to refresh my memory.\" And Mr. Dockwrath took a small letter-case\nout of his breast coat pocket.\n\nBy this time Mr. Mason's curiosity had been roused, and he began\nto think it possible that his visitor had discovered information\nwhich might be of importance to him. \"Are you going to show me any\ndocument?\" said he.\n\n\"That's as may be,\" said the attorney. \"I don't know as yet whether\nyou care to see it. I have come a long way to do you a service, and\nit seems to me you are rather shy of coming forward to meet me. As I\nsaid before, I've a very heavy family, and I'm not going to cut the\nnose off my own face to put money into any other man's pocket. What\ndo you think my journey down here will cost me, including loss of\ntime, and interruption to my business?\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Dockwrath; if you are really able to put me into\npossession of any facts regarding the Orley Farm estate which I\nought to know, I will see that you are compensated for your time and\ntrouble. Messrs. Round and Crook--\"\n\n\"I'll have nothing to do with Round and Crook. So that's settled, Mr.\nMason.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Dockwrath--\"\n\n\"Half a minute, Mr. Mason. I'll have nothing to do with Round and\nCrook; but as I know you to be a gentleman and a man of honour, I'll\nput you in possession of what I've discovered, and leave it to you\nafterwards to do what you think right about my expenses, time, and\nservices. You won't forget that it is a long way from Hamworth to\nGroby Park. And if you should succeed--\"\n\n\"If I am to look at this document, I must do so without pledging\nmyself to anything,\" said Mr. Mason, still with much solemnity. He\nhad great doubts as to his new acquaintance, and much feared that\nhe was derogating from his dignity as a county magistrate and owner\nof Groby Park in holding any personal intercourse with him; but\nnevertheless he could not resist the temptation. He most firmly\nbelieved that that codicil had not expressed the genuine last will\nand fair disposition of property made by his father, and it might\ncertainly be the case that proof of all that he believed was to be\nfound among the papers of the old lawyer. He hated Lady Mason with\nall his power of hatred, and if there did, even yet, exist for him a\nchance of upsetting her claims and ruining her before the world, he\nwas not the man to forego that chance.\n\n\"Well, sir, you shall see it,\" said Mr. Dockwrath; \"or rather hear\nit, for there is not much to see.\" And so saying he extracted from\nhis pocket-book a very small bit of paper.\n\n\"I should prefer to read it, if it's all the same to you, Mr.\nDockwrath. I shall understand it much better in that way.\"\n\n\"As you like, Mr. Mason,\" said the attorney, handing him the small\nbit of paper. \"You will understand, sir, that it's no real copy, but\nonly a few dates and particulars, just jotted down to assist my own\nmemory.\" The document, supported by which Mr. Dockwrath had come\ndown to Yorkshire, consisted of half a sheet of note paper, and the\nwriting upon this covered hardly the half of it. The words which Mr.\nMason read were as follows:--\n\n\n   Date of codicil. 14th July 18--.\n\n   Witnesses to the instrument. John Kenneby; Bridget\n   Bolster; Jonathan Usbech. N.B. Jonathan Usbech died before\n   the testator.\n\n   Mason and Martock. Deed of separation; dated 14th July\n   18--.\n\n   Executed at Orley Farm.\n\n   Witnesses John Kenneby; and Bridget Bolster. Deed was\n   prepared in the office of Jonathan Usbech, and probably\n   executed in his presence.\n\n\nThat was all that was written on the paper, and Mr. Mason read the\nwords to himself three times before he looked up, or said anything\nconcerning them. He was not a man quick at receiving new ideas into\nhis mind, or of understanding new points; but that which had once\nbecome intelligible to him and been made his own, remained so always.\n\"Well,\" said he, when he read the above words for the third time.\n\n\"You don't see it, sir?\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"See what?\" said Mr. Mason, still looking at the scrap of paper.\n\n\"Why; the dates, to begin with.\"\n\n\"I see that the dates are the same;--the 14th of July in the same\nyear.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, looking very keenly into the magistrate's\nface.\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Mason, looking over the paper at his boot.\n\n\"John Kenneby and Bridget Bolster were witnesses to both the\ninstruments,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"So I see,\" said the magistrate.\n\n\"But I don't remember that it came out in evidence that either of\nthem recollected having been called on for two signatures on the same\nday.\"\n\n\"No; there was nothing of that came out;--or was even hinted at.\"\n\n\"No; nothing even hinted at, Mr. Mason,--as you justly observe. That\nis what I mean by saying that Round and Crook's people didn't get up\ntheir little facts. Believe me, sir, there are men in the profession\nout of London who know quite as much as Round and Crook. They ought\nto have had those facts, seeing that the very copy of the document\nwas turned over by their hands.\" And Mr. Dockwrath hit the table\nheavily in the warmth of his indignation against his professional\nbrethren. Earlier in the interview Mr. Mason would have been made\nvery angry by such freedom, but he was not angry now.\n\n\"Yes; they ought to have known it,\" said he. But he did not even yet\nsee the point. He merely saw that there was a point worth seeing.\n\n\"Known it! Of course they ought to have known it. Look here, Mr.\nMason! If I had it on my mind that I'd thrown over a client of mine\nby such carelessness as that, I'd--I'd strike my own name off the\nrolls; I would indeed. I never could look a counsel in the face\nagain, if I'd neglected to brief him with such facts as those. I\nsuppose it was carelessness; eh, Mr. Mason?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I'm afraid so,\" said Mr. Mason, still rather in the dark.\n\n\"They could have had no object in keeping it back, I should say.\"\n\n\"No; none in life. But let us see, Mr. Dockwrath; how does it bear\nupon us? The dates are the same, and the witnesses the same.\"\n\n\"The deed of separation is genuine. There is no doubt about that.\"\n\n\"Oh; you're sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite certain. I found it entered in the old office books. It was\nthe last of a lot of such documents executed between Mason and\nMartock after the old man gave up the business. You see she was\nalways with him, and knew all about it.\"\n\n\"About the partnership deed?\"\n\n\"Of course she did. She's a clever woman, Mr. Mason; very clever, and\nit's almost a pity that she should come to grief. She has carried it\non so well; hasn't she?\"\n\nMr. Mason's face now became very black. \"Why,\" said he, \"if what you\nseem to allege be true, she must be a--a--a--. What do you mean, sir,\nby pity?\"\n\nMr. Dockwrath shrugged his shoulders. \"It is very blue,\" said he,\n\"uncommon blue.\"\n\n\"She must be a swindler; a common swindler. Nay, worse than that.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, a deal worse than that, Mr. Mason. And as for\ncommon;--according to my way of thinking there's nothing at all\ncommon about it. I look upon it as about the best got-up plant I ever\nremember to have heard of. I do, indeed, Mr. Mason.\" The attorney\nduring the last ten minutes of the conversation had quite altered\nhis tone, understanding that he had already achieved a great part\nof his object; but Mr. Mason in his intense anxiety did not observe\nthis. Had Mr. Dockwrath, in commencing the conversation, talked about\n\"plants\" and \"blue,\" Mr. Mason would probably have rung his bell for\nthe servant. \"If it's anything, it's forgery,\" said Mr. Dockwrath,\nlooking his companion full in the face.\n\n\"I always felt sure that my father never intended to sign such a\ncodicil as that.\"\n\n\"He never did sign it, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"And,--and the witnesses!\" said Mr. Mason, still not enlightened as\nto the true extent of the attorney's suspicion.\n\n\"They signed the other deed; that is two of them did. There is no\ndoubt about that;--on that very day. They certainly did witness a\nsignature made by the old gentleman in his own room on that 14th of\nJuly. The original of that document, with the date and their names,\nwill be forthcoming soon enough.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"But they did not witness two signatures.\"\n\n\"You think not, eh!\"\n\n\"I'm sure of it. The girl Bolster would have remembered it, and would\nhave said so. She was sharp enough.\"\n\n\"Who wrote all the names then at the foot of the will?\" said Mr.\nMason.\n\n\"Ah! that's the question. Who did write them? We know very well, Mr.\nMason, you and I that is, who did not. And having come to that, I\nthink we may give a very good guess who did.\"\n\nAnd then they both sat silent for some three or four minutes. Mr.\nDockwrath was quite at his ease, rubbing his chin with his hand,\nplaying with a paper-knife which he had taken from the study\ntable, and waiting till it should please Mr. Mason to renew the\nconversation. Mr. Mason was not at his ease, though all idea of\naffecting any reserve before the attorney had left him. He was\nthinking how best he might confound and destroy the woman who had\nrobbed him for so many years; who had defied him, got the better of\nhim, and put him to terrible cost; who had vexed his spirit through\nhis whole life, deprived him of content, and had been to him as a\nthorn ever present in a festering sore. He had always believed that\nshe had defrauded him, but this belief had been qualified by the\nunbelief of others. It might have been, he had half thought, that the\nold man had signed the codicil in his dotage, having been cheated and\nbullied into it by the woman. There had been no day in her life on\nwhich he would not have ruined her, had it been in his power to do\nso. But now--now, new and grander ideas were breaking in upon his\nmind. Could it be possible that he might live to see her, not merely\ndeprived of her ill-gained money, but standing in the dock as a felon\nto receive sentence for her terrible misdeeds? If that might be so,\nwould he not receive great compensation for all that he had suffered?\nWould it not be sweet to his sense of justice that both of them\nshould thus at last have their own? He did not even yet understand\nall that Mr. Dockwrath suspected. He did not fully perceive why the\nwoman was supposed to have chosen as the date of her forgery, the\ndate of that other genuine deed. But he did understand, he did\nperceive--at least so he thought,--that new and perhaps conclusive\nevidence of her villainy was at last within his reach.\n\n\"And what shall we do now, Mr. Dockwrath?\" he said at last.\n\n\"Well; am I to understand that you do me the honour of asking my\nadvice upon that question as being your lawyer?\"\n\nThis question immediately brought Mr. Mason back to business that he\ndid understand. \"A man in my position cannot very well change his\nlegal advisers at a moment's notice. You must be very well aware of\nthat, Mr. Dockwrath. Messrs. Round and Crook--\"\n\n\"Messrs. Round and Crook, sir, have neglected your business in a most\nshameful manner. Let me tell you that, sir.\"\n\n\"Well; that's as may be. I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Dockwrath;\nI'll think over this matter in quiet, and then I'll come up to town.\nPerhaps when there I may expect the honour of a further visit from\nyou.\"\n\n\"And you won't mention the matter to Round and Crook?\"\n\n\"I can't undertake to say that, Mr. Dockwrath. I think it will\nperhaps be better that I should mention it, and then see you\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"And how about my expenses down here?\"\n\nJust at this moment there came a light tap at the study door, and\nbefore the master of the house could give or withhold permission\nthe mistress of the house entered the room. \"My dear,\" she said, \"I\ndidn't know that you were engaged.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am engaged,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"Oh, I'm sure I beg pardon. Perhaps this is the gentleman from\nHamworth?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" said Mr. Dockwrath. \"I am the gentleman from Hamworth.\nI hope I have the pleasure of seeing you very well, ma'am?\" And\ngetting up from his chair he bowed politely.\n\n\"Mr. Dockwrath, Mrs. Mason,\" said the lady's husband, introducing\nthem; and then Mrs. Mason curtsied to the stranger. She too was very\nanxious to know what might be the news from Hamworth.\n\n\"Mr. Dockwrath will lunch with us, my dear,\" said Mr. Mason. And then\nthe lady, on hospitable cares intent, left them again to themselves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nMRS. MASON'S HOT LUNCHEON.\n\n\nThough Mr. Dockwrath was somewhat elated by this invitation to lunch,\nhe was also somewhat abashed by it. He had been far from expecting\nthat Mr. Mason of Groby Park would do him any such honour, and was\nmade aware by it of the great hold which he must have made upon the\nattention of his host. But nevertheless he immediately felt that his\nhands were to a certain degree tied. He, having been invited to sit\ndown at Mr. Mason's table, with Mrs. M. and the family,--having been\ntreated as though he were a gentleman, and thus being for the time\nbeing put on a footing of equality with the county magistrate, could\nnot repeat that last important question: \"How about my expenses down\nhere?\" nor could he immediately go on with the grand subject in any\nframe of mind which would tend to further his own interests. Having\nbeen invited to lunch, he could not haggle with due persistency for\nhis share of the business in crushing Lady Mason, nor stipulate\nthat the whole concern should not be trusted to the management of\nRound and Crook. As a source of pride this invitation to eat was\npleasant to him, but he was forced to acknowledge to himself that it\ninterfered with business.\n\nNor did Mr. Mason feel himself ready to go on with the conversation\nin the manner in which it had been hitherto conducted. His mind was\nfull of Orley Farm and his wrongs, and he could bring himself to\nthink of nothing else; but he could no longer talk about it to the\nattorney sitting there in his study. \"Will you take a turn about the\nplace while the lunch is getting ready?\" he said. So they took their\nhats and went out into the garden.\n\n\"It is dreadful to think of,\" said Mr. Mason, after they had twice\nwalked in silence the length of a broad gravel terrace.\n\n\"What; about her ladyship?\" said the attorney.\n\n\"Quite dreadful!\" and Mr. Mason shuddered. \"I don't think I ever\nheard of anything so shocking in my life. For twenty years, Mr.\nDockwrath, think of that. Twenty years!\" and his face as he spoke\nbecame almost black with horror.\n\n\"It is very shocking,\" said Mr. Dockwrath; \"very shocking. What on\nearth will be her fate if it be proved against her? She has brought\nit on herself; that is all that one can say of her.\"\n\n\"D---- her! d---- her!\" exclaimed the other, gnashing his teeth\nwith concentrated wrath. \"No punishment will be bad enough for her.\nHanging would not be bad enough.\"\n\n\"They can't hang her, Mr. Mason,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, almost\nfrightened by the violence of his companion.\n\n\"No; they have altered the laws, giving every encouragement to\nforgers, villains, and perjurers. But they can give her penal\nservitude for life. They must do it.\"\n\n\"She is not convicted yet, you know.\"\n\n\"D---- her!\" repeated the owner of Groby Park again, as he thought of\nhis twenty years of loss. Eight hundred a year for twenty years had\nbeen taken away from him; and he had been worsted before the world\nafter a hard fight. \"D---- her!\" he continued to growl between his\nteeth. Mr. Dockwrath when he had first heard his companion say how\nhorrid and dreadful the affair was, had thought that Mr. Mason was\nalluding to the condition in which the lady had placed herself by her\nassumed guilt. But it was of his own condition that he was speaking.\nThe idea which shocked him was the thought of the treatment which he\nhimself had undergone. The dreadful thing at which he shuddered was\nhis own ill usage. As for her;--pity for her! Did a man ever pity a\nrat that had eaten into his choicest dainties?\n\n\"The lunch is on the table, sir,\" said the Groby Park footman in the\nGroby Park livery. Under the present household arrangement of Groby\nPark all the servants lived on board wages. Mrs. Mason did not like\nthis system, though it had about it certain circumstances of economy\nwhich recommended it to her; it interfered greatly with the stringent\naptitudes of her character and the warmest passion of her heart; it\ntook away from her the delicious power of serving out the servants'\nfood, of locking up the scraps of meat, and of charging the maids\nwith voracity. But, to tell the truth, Mr. Mason had been driven by\nsheer necessity to take this step, as it had been found impossible to\ninduce his wife to give out sufficient food to enable the servants to\nlive and work. She knew that in not doing so she injured herself; but\nshe could not do it. The knife in passing through the loaf would make\nthe portion to be parted with less by one third than the portion to\nbe retained. Half a pound of salt butter would reduce itself to a\nquarter of a pound. Portions of meat would become infinitesimal.\nWhen standing with viands before her, she had not free will over her\nhands. She could not bring herself to part with victuals, though she\nmight ruin herself by retaining them. Therefore, by the order of the\nmaster, were the servants placed on board wages.\n\nMr. Dockwrath soon found himself in the dining-room, where the three\nyoung ladies with their mamma were already seated at the table. It\nwas a handsome room, and the furniture was handsome; but nevertheless\nit was a heavy room, and the furniture was heavy. The table was large\nenough for a party of twelve, and might have borne a noble banquet;\nas it was the promise was not bad, for there were three large plated\ncovers concealing hot viands, and in some houses lunch means only\nbread and cheese.\n\nMr. Mason went through the form of introduction between Mr. Dockwrath\nand his daughters. \"That is Miss Mason, that Miss Creusa Mason, and\nthis Miss Penelope. John, remove the covers.\" And the covers were\nremoved, John taking them from the table with a magnificent action of\nhis arm which I am inclined to think was not innocent of irony. On\nthe dish before the master of the house,--a large dish which must I\nfancy have been selected by the cook with some similar attempt at\nsarcasm,--there reposed three scraps, as to the nature of which Mr.\nDockwrath, though he looked hard at them, was unable to enlighten\nhimself. But Mr. Mason knew them well, as he now placed his eyes on\nthem for the third time. They were old enemies of his, and his brow\nagain became black as he looked at them. The scraps in fact consisted\nof two drumsticks of a fowl and some indescribable bone out of the\nback of the same. The original bird had no doubt first revealed\nall its glories to human eyes,--presuming the eyes of the cook to\nbe inhuman--in Mrs. Mason's \"boodoor.\" Then, on the dish before\nthe lady, there were three other morsels, black-looking and very\nsuspicious to the eye, which in the course of conversation were\nproclaimed to be ham,--broiled ham. Mrs. Mason would never allow\na ham in its proper shape to come into the room, because it is an\narticle upon which the guests are themselves supposed to operate\nwith the carving-knife. Lastly, on the dish before Miss Creusa there\nreposed three potatoes.\n\nThe face of Mr. Mason became very black as he looked at the banquet\nwhich was spread upon his board, and Mrs. Mason, eyeing him across\nthe table, saw that it was so. She was not a lady who despised such\nsymptoms in her lord, or disregarded in her valour the violence of\nmarital storms. She had quailed more than once or twice under rebuke\noccasioned by her great domestic virtue, and knew that her husband,\nthough he might put up with much as regarded his own comfort, and\nthat of his children, could be very angry at injuries done to his\nhousehold honour and character as a hospitable English country\ngentleman.\n\nConsequently the lady smiled and tried to look self-satisfied as\nshe invited her guest to eat. \"This is ham,\" said she with a little\nsimper, \"broiled ham, Mr. Dockwrath; and there is chicken at the\nother end; I think they call it--devilled.\"\n\n\"Shall I assist the young ladies to anything first?\" said the\nattorney, wishing to be polite.\n\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said Miss Penelope, with a very stiff bow.\nShe also knew that Mr. Dockwrath was an attorney from Hamworth, and\nconsidered herself by no means bound to hold any sort of conversation\nwith him.\n\n\"My daughters only eat bread and butter in the middle of the day,\"\nsaid the lady. \"Creusa, my dear, will you give Mr. Dockwrath a\npotato. Mr. Mason, Mr. Dockwrath will probably take a bit of that\nchicken.\"\n\n\"I would recommend him to follow the girls' example, and confine\nhimself to the bread and butter,\" said the master of the house,\npushing about the scraps with his knife and fork. \"There is nothing\nhere for him to eat.\"\n\n\"My dear!\" exclaimed Mrs. Mason.\n\n\"There is nothing here for him to eat,\" repeated Mr. Mason. \"And\nas far as I can see there is nothing there either. What is it you\npretend to have in that dish?\"\n\n\"My dear!\" again exclaimed Mrs. Mason.\n\n\"What is it?\" repeated the lord of the house in an angry tone.\n\n\"Broiled ham, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Then let the ham be brought in,\" said he. \"Diana, ring the bell.\"\n\n\"But the ham is not cooked, Mr. Mason,\" said the lady. \"Broiled ham\nis always better when it has not been first boiled.\"\n\n\"Is there no cold meat in the house?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am afraid not,\" she replied, now trembling a little in\nanticipation of what might be coming after the stranger should have\ngone. \"You never like large joints yourself, Mr. Mason; and for\nourselves we don't eat meat at luncheon.\"\n\n\"Nor anybody else either, here,\" said Mr. Mason in his anger.\n\n\"Pray don't mind me, Mr. Mason,\" said the attorney, \"pray don't, Mr.\nMason. I am a very poor fist at lunch; I am indeed.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am very sorry, very sorry, Mr. Mason,\" continued the\nlady. \"If I had known that an early dinner was required, it should\nhave been provided;--although the notice given was so very short.\"\n\n\"I never dine early,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, thinking that some\nimputation of a low way of living was conveyed in this supposition\nthat he required a dinner under the pseudonym of a lunch. \"I never\ndo, upon my word--we are quite regular at home at half-past five, and\nall I ever take in the middle of the day is a biscuit and a glass of\nsherry,--or perhaps a bite of bread and cheese. Don't be uneasy about\nme, Mrs. Mason.\"\n\nThe three young ladies, having now finished their repast, got up from\nthe table and retired, following each other out of the room in a\nline. Mrs. Mason remained for a minute or two longer, and then she\nalso went. \"The carriage has been ordered at three, Mr. M.,\" she\nsaid. \"Shall we have the pleasure of your company?\" \"No,\" growled\nthe husband. And then the lady went, sweeping a low curtsy to Mr.\nDockwrath as she passed out of the room.\n\nThere was again a silence between the host and his guest for some two\nor three minutes, during which Mr. Mason was endeavouring to get the\nlunch out of his head, and to redirect his whole mind to Lady Mason\nand his hopes of vengeance. There is nothing perhaps so generally\nconsoling to a man as a well-established grievance; a feeling of\nhaving been injured, on which his mind can brood from hour to hour,\nallowing him to plead his own cause in his own court, within his\nown heart,--and always to plead it successfully. At last Mr. Mason\nsucceeded, and he could think of his enemy's fraud and forget his\nwife's meanness. \"I suppose I may as well order my gig now,\" said Mr.\nDockwrath, as soon as his host had arrived at this happy frame of\nmind.\n\n\"Your gig? ah, well. Yes. I do not know that I need detain you\nany longer. I can assure you that I am much obliged to you, Mr.\nDockwrath, and I shall hope to see you in London very shortly.\"\n\n\"You are determined to go to Round and Crook, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, sir. They'll throw you over again as sure as your\nname is Mason.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dockwrath, you must if you please allow me to judge of that\nmyself.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, sir, of course. But I'm sure that a gentleman like\nyou, Mr. Mason, will understand--\"\n\n\"I shall understand that I cannot expect your services, Mr.\nDockwrath,--your valuable time and services,--without remunerating\nyou for them. That shall be fully explained to Messrs. Round and\nCrook.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir; very well. As long as I am paid for what I do, I am\ncontent. A professional gentleman of course expects that. How is he\nto get along else; particular with sixteen children?\" And then Mr.\nDockwrath got into the gig, and was driven back to the Bull at Leeds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nA CONVIVIAL MEETING.\n\n\nOn the whole Mr. Dockwrath was satisfied with the results of his trip\nto Groby Park, and was in a contented frame of mind as he was driven\nback to Leeds. No doubt it would have been better could he have\npersuaded Mr. Mason to throw over Messrs. Round and Crook, and put\nhimself altogether into the hands of his new adviser; but this had\nbeen too much to expect. He had not expected it, and had made the\nsuggestion as the surest means of getting the best terms in his\npower, rather than with a hope of securing the actual advantage\nnamed. He had done much towards impressing Mr. Mason with an idea of\nhis own sharpness, and perhaps something also towards breaking the\nprestige which surrounded the names of the great London firm. He\nwould now go to that firm and make his terms with them. They would\nprobably be quite as ready to acquiesce in the importance of his\ninformation as had been Mr. Mason.\n\nBefore leaving the inn after breakfast he had agreed to join the\ndinner in the commercial room at five o'clock, and Mr. Mason's hot\nlunch had by no means induced him to alter his purpose. \"I shall dine\nhere,\" he had said when Mr. Moulder was discussing with the waiter\nthe all-important subject of dinner. \"At the commercial table sir?\"\nthe waiter had asked, doubtingly. Mr. Dockwrath had answered boldly\nin the affirmative, whereat Mr. Moulder had growled; but Mr. Kantwise\nhad expressed satisfaction. \"We shall be extremely happy to enjoy\nyour company,\" Mr. Kantwise had said, with a graceful bow, making up\nby his excessive courtesy for the want of any courtesy on the part of\nhis brother-traveller. With reference to all this Mr. Moulder said\nnothing; the stranger had been admitted into the room, to a certain\nextent even with his own consent, and he could not now be turned out;\nbut he resolved within his own mind that for the future he would\nbe more firm in maintaining the ordinances and institutes of his\nprofession.\n\nOn his road home, Mr. Dockwrath had encountered Mr. Kantwise going to\nGroby Park, intent on his sale of a drawing-room set of the metallic\nfurniture; and when he again met him in the commercial room he asked\nafter his success. \"A wonderful woman that, Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Mr.\nKantwise, \"a really wonderful woman; no particular friend of yours I\nthink you say?\"\n\n\"None in the least, Mr. Kantwise,\"\n\n\"Then I may make bold to assert that for persevering sharpness she\nbeats all that I ever met, even in Yorkshire;\" and Mr. Kantwise\nlooked at his new friend over his shoulder, and shook his head as\nthough lost in wonder and admiration. \"What do you think she's done\nnow?\"\n\n\"She didn't give you much to eat, I take it.\"\n\n\"Much to eat! I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dockwrath; my belief is\nthat woman would have an absolute pleasure in starving a Christian; I\ndo indeed. I'll tell you what she has done; she has made me put her\nup a set of them things at twelve, seventeen, six! I needn't tell you\nthat they were never made for the money.\"\n\n\"Why, then, did you part with them at a loss?\"\n\n\"Well; that's the question. I was soft, I suppose. She got round me,\nbadgering me, till I didn't know where I was. She wanted them as a\npresent for the curate's wife, she said. Whatever should induce her\nto make a present!\"\n\n\"She got them for twelve, seventeen, six; did she?\" said Dockwrath,\nthinking that it might be as well to remember this, if he should feel\ninclined to make a purchase himself.\n\n\"But they was strained, Mr. Dockwrath; I must admit they was\nstrained,--particularly the loo.\"\n\n\"You had gone through your gymnastics on it a little too often?\"\nasked the attorney. But this Mr. Kantwise would not acknowledge. The\nstrength of that table was such that he could stand on it for ever\nwithout injury to it; but nevertheless, in some other way it had\nbecome strained, and therefore he had sold the set to Mrs. Mason for\n\u00c2\u00a312 17_s._ 6_d._, that lady being minded to make a costly present to\nthe wife of the curate of Groby.\n\nWhen dinner-time came Mr. Dockwrath found that the party was swelled\nto the number of eight, five other undoubted commercials having\nbrought themselves to anchor at the Bull Inn during the day. To all\nof these, Mr. Kantwise introduced him. \"Mr. Gape, Mr. Dockwrath,\"\nsaid he, gracefully moving towards them the palm of his hand, and\neyeing them over his shoulder. \"Mr. Gape is in the stationery line,\"\nhe added, in a whisper to the attorney, \"and does for Cumming and\nJibber of St. Paul's Churchyard. Mr. Johnson, Mr. Dockwrath. Mr.\nJ. is from Sheffield. Mr. Snengkeld, Mr. Dockwrath;\" and then he\nimparted in another whisper the necessary information as to Mr.\nSnengkeld. \"Soft goods, for Brown Brothers, of Snow Hill,\" and so\non through the whole fraternity. Each member bowed as his name was\nmentioned; but they did not do so very graciously, as Mr. Kantwise\nwas not a great man among them. Had the stranger been introduced to\nthem by Moulder,--Moulder the patriarch,--his reception among them\nwould have been much warmer. And then they sat down to dinner, Mr.\nMoulder taking the chair as president, and Mr. Kantwise sitting\nopposite to him, as being the longest sojourner at the inn. Mr.\nDockwrath sat at the right hand of Kantwise, discreetly avoiding the\nneighbourhood of Moulder, and the others ranged themselves according\nto fancy at the table. \"Come up along side of me, old fellow,\"\nMoulder said to Snengkeld. \"It ain't the first time that you and\nI have smacked our lips together over the same bit of roast beef.\"\n\"Nor won't, I hope, be the last by a long chalk, Mr. Moulder,\"\nsaid Snengkeld, speaking with a deep, hoarse voice which seemed to\nascend from some region of his body far below his chest. Moulder and\nSnengkeld were congenial spirits; but the latter, though the older\nman, was not endowed with so large a volume of body or so highly\ndominant a spirit. Brown Brothers, of Snow Hill, were substantial\npeople, and Mr. Snengkeld travelled in strict accordance with the\ngood old rules of trade which Moulder loved so well.\n\nThe politeness and general good manners of the company were something\nvery pretty to witness. Mr. Dockwrath, as a stranger, was helped\nfirst, and every courtesy was shown to him. Even Mr. Moulder carved\nthe beef for him with a loving hand, and Mr. Kantwise was almost\nsubservient in his attention. Mr. Dockwrath thought that he had\ncertainly done right in coming to the commercial table, and resolved\non doing so on all occasions of future journeys. So far all was good.\nThe commercial dinner, as he had ascertained, would cost him only\ntwo shillings, and a much inferior repast eaten by himself elsewhere\nwould have stood in his bill for three. So far all was good; but the\ntest by which he was to be tried was now approaching him.\n\nWhen the dinner was just half over,--Mr. Moulder well knew how to\nmark the time,--that gentleman called for the waiter, and whispered\nan important order into that functionary's ears. The functionary\nbowed, retired from the room, and reappeared again in two minutes,\nbearing a bottle of sherry in each hand; one of these he deposited at\nthe right hand of Mr. Moulder; and the other at the right hand of Mr.\nKantwise.\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mr. Moulder, addressing himself with great ceremony to\nMr. Dockwrath, \"the honour of a glass of wine with you, sir,\" and\nthe president, to give more importance to the occasion, put down his\nknife and fork, leaned back in his chair, and put both his hands upon\nhis waistcoat, looking intently at the attorney out of his little\neyes.\n\nMr. Dockwrath was immediately aware that a crisis had come upon\nhim which demanded an instant decision. If he complied with the\npresident's invitation he would have to pay his proportion of all the\nwine bill that might be incurred that evening by the seven commercial\ngentlemen at the table, and he knew well that commercial gentlemen do\nsometimes call for bottle after bottle with a reckless disregard of\nexpense. But to him, with his sixteen children, wine at an hotel was\nterrible. A pint of beer and a glass of brandy and water were the\nluxuries which he had promised himself, and with manly fortitude\nhe resolved that he would not be coerced into extravagance by any\npresident or any Moulder.\n\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I'm obliged by the honour, but I don't drink wine\nto my dinner.\" Whereupon Mr. Moulder bowed his head very solemnly,\nwinked at Snengkeld, and then drank wine with that gentleman.\n\n\"It's the rule of the room,\" whispered Mr. Kantwise into Mr.\nDockwrath's ear; but Mr. Dockwrath pretended not to hear him, and the\nmatter was allowed to pass by for the time.\n\nBut Mr. Snengkeld asked him for the honour, as also did Mr. Gape,\nwho sat at Moulder's left hand; and then Mr. Dockwrath began to wax\nangry. \"I think I remarked before that I don't drink wine to my\ndinner,\" he said; and then the three at the president's end of the\ntable all looked at each other very solemnly, and they all winked;\nand after that there was very little conversation during the\nremainder of the meal, for men knew that the goddess of discord was\nin the air.\n\nThe cheese came, and with that a bottle of port wine, which was\nhanded round, Mr. Dockwrath of course refusing to join in the\nconviviality; and then the cloth was drawn, and the decanters\nwere put before the president. \"James, bring me a little\nbrandy-and-water,\" said the attorney, striving to put a bold face on\nthe matter, but yet speaking with diminished voice.\n\n\"Half a moment, if you please, sir,\" said Moulder; and then he\nexclaimed with stentorian voice, \"James, the dinner bill.\" \"Yes,\nsir,\" said the waiter, and disappeared without any thought towards\nthe requisition for brandy-and-water from Mr. Dockwrath.\n\nFor the next five minutes they all remained silent, except that Mr.\nMoulder gave the Queen's health as he filled his glass and pushed\nthe bottles from him. \"Gentlemen, the Queen,\" and then he lifted his\nglass of port up to the light, shut one eye as he looked at it, and\nimmediately swallowed the contents as though he were taking a dose\nof physic. \"I'm afraid they'll charge you for the wine,\" said Mr.\nKantwise, again whispering to his neighbour. But Mr. Dockwrath paid\nno apparent attention to what was said to him. He was concentrating\nhis energies with a view to the battle.\n\nJames, the waiter, soon returned. He also knew well what was\nabout to happen, and he trembled as he handed in the document to\nthe president. \"Let's have it, James,\" said Moulder, with much\npleasantry, as he took the paper in his hand. \"The old ticket I\nsuppose; five bob a head.\" And then he read out the bill, the total\nof which, wine and beer included, came to forty shillings. \"Five\nshillings a head, gentlemen, as I said. You and I can make a pretty\ngood guess as to the figure; eh, Snengkeld?\" And then he put down his\ntwo half-crowns on the waiter, as also did Mr. Snengkeld, and then\nMr. Gape, and so on till it came to Mr. Kantwise.\n\n\"I think you and I will leave it, and settle at the bar,\" said\nKantwise, appealing to Dockwrath, and intending peace if peace were\nstill possible.\n\n\"No,\" shouted Moulder, from the other end of the table; \"let the man\nhave his money now, and then his troubles will be over. If there's\nto be any fuss about it, let's have it out. I like to see the dinner\nbill settled as soon as the dinner is eaten. Then one gets an\nappetite for one's supper.\"\n\n\"I don't think I have the change,\" said Kantwise, still putting off\nthe evil day.\n\n\"I'll lend, it you,\" said Moulder, putting his hand into his\ntrousers-pockets. But the money was forthcoming out of Mr. Kantwise's\nown proper repositories, and with slow motion he put down the five\nshillings one after the other.\n\nAnd then the waiter came to Mr. Dockwrath. \"What's this?\" said the\nattorney, taking up the bill and looking at it. The whole matter had\nbeen sufficiently explained to him, but nevertheless Mr. Moulder\nexplained it again. \"In commercial rooms, sir, as no doubt you must\nbe well aware, seeing that you have done us the honour of joining us\nhere, the dinner bill is divided equally among all the gentlemen as\nsit down. It's the rule of the room, sir. You has what you like, and\nyou calls for what you like, and conwiviality is thereby encouraged.\nThe figure generally comes to five shillings, and you afterwards\ngives what you like to the waiter. That's about it, ain't it, James?\"\n\n\"That's the rule, sir, in all commercial rooms as I ever see,\" said\nthe waiter.\n\nThe matter had been so extremely well put by Mr. Moulder, and that\ngentleman's words had carried with them so much conviction, that\nDockwrath felt himself almost tempted to put down the money; as far\nas his sixteen children and general ideas of economy were concerned\nhe would have done so; but his legal mind could not bear to be\nbeaten. The spirit of litigation within him told him that the point\nwas to be carried. Moulder, Gape, and Snengkeld together could not\nmake him pay for wine he had neither ordered nor swallowed. His\npocket was guarded by the law of the land, and not by the laws of any\nspecial room in which he might chance to find himself. \"I shall pay\ntwo shillings for my dinner,\" said he, \"and sixpence for my beer;\"\nand then he deposited the half-crown.\n\n\"Do you mean us to understand,\" said Moulder, \"that after forcing\nyour way into this room, and sitting down along with gentlemen at\nthis table, you refuse to abide by the rules of the room?\" And Mr.\nMoulder spoke and looked as though he thought that such treachery\nmust certainly lead to most disastrous results. The disastrous result\nwhich a stranger might have expected at the moment would be a fit of\napoplexy on the part of the worthy president.\n\n\"I neither ordered that wine nor did I drink it,\" said Mr. Dockwrath,\ncompressing his lips, leaning back in his chair, and looking up into\none corner of the ceiling.\n\n\"The gentleman certainly did not drink the wine,\" said Kantwise, \"I\nmust acknowledge that; and as for ordering it, why that was done by\nthe president, in course.\"\n\n\"Gammon!\" said Mr. Moulder, and he fixed his eyes steadfastly upon\nhis Vice. \"Kantwise, that's gammon. The most of what you says is\ngammon.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moulder, I don't exactly know what you mean by that word gammon,\nbut it's objectionable. To my feelings it's very objectionable. I\nsay that the gentleman did not drink the wine, and I appeal to the\ngentleman who sits at the gentleman's right, whether what I say\nis not correct. If what I say is correct, it can't be--gammon. Mr.\nBusby, did that gentleman drink the wine, or did he not?\"\n\n\"Not as I see,\" said Mr. Busby, somewhat nervous at being thus\nbrought into the controversy. He was a young man just commencing his\ntravels, and stood in awe of the great Moulder.\n\n\"Gammon!\" shouted Moulder, with a very red face. \"Everybody at the\ntable knows he didn't drink the wine. Everybody saw that he declined\nthe honour when proposed, which I don't know that I ever saw a\ngentleman do at a commercial table till this day, barring that he\nwas a teetotaller, which is gammon too. But its P.P. here, as every\ncommercial gentleman knows, Kantwise as well as the best of us.\"\n\n\"P.P., that's the rule,\" growled Snengkeld, almost from under the\ntable.\n\n\"In commercial rooms, as the gentleman must be aware, the rule is as\nstated by my friend on my right,\" said Mr. Gape. \"The wine is ordered\nby the president or chairman, and is paid for in equal proportions by\nthe company or guests,\" and in his oratory Mr. Gape laid great stress\non the word \"or.\" \"The gentleman will easily perceive that such a\nrule as this is necessary in such a society; and unless--\"\n\nBut Mr. Gape was apt to make long speeches, and therefore Mr. Moulder\ninterrupted him. \"You had better pay your five shillings, sir, and\nhave no jaw about it. The man is standing idle there.\"\n\n\"It's not the value of the money,\" said Dockwrath, \"but I must\ndecline to acknowledge that I am amenable to the jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"There has clearly been a mistake,\" said Johnson from Sheffield, \"and\nwe had better settle it among us; anything is better than a row.\"\nJohnson from Sheffield was a man somewhat inclined to dispute the\nsupremacy of Moulder from Houndsditch.\n\n\"No, Johnson,\" said the president. \"Anything is not better than a\nrow. A premeditated infraction of our rules is not better than a\nrow.\"\n\n\"Did you say premeditated?\" said Kantwise. \"I think not\npremeditated.\"\n\n\"I did say premeditated, and I say it again.\"\n\n\"It looks uncommon like it,\" said Snengkeld.\n\n\"When a gentleman,\" said Gape, \"who does not belong to a society--\"\n\n\"It's no good having more talk,\" said Moulder, \"and we'll soon\nbring this to an end. Mr.--; I haven't the honour of knowing the\ngentleman's name.\"\n\n\"My name is Dockwrath, and I am a solicitor.\"\n\n\"Oh, a solicitor; are you? and you said last night you was\ncommercial! Will you be good enough to tell us, Mr. Solicitor--for I\ndidn't just catch your name, except that it begins with a dock--and\nthat's where most of your clients are to be found, I suppose--\"\n\n\"Order, order, order!\" said Kantwise, holding up both his hands.\n\n\"It's the chair as is speaking,\" said Mr. Gape, who had a true\nEnglishman's notion that the chair itself could not be called to\norder.\n\n\"You shouldn't insult the gentleman because he has his own ideas,\"\nsaid Johnson.\n\n\"I don't want to insult no one,\" continued Moulder; \"and those who\nknow me best, among whom I can't as yet count Mr. Johnson, though\nhopes I shall some day, won't say it of me.\" \"Hear--hear--hear!\"\nfrom both Snengkeld and Gape; to which Kantwise added a little\n\"hear--hear!\" of his own, of which Mr. Moulder did not quite approve.\n\"Mr. Snengkeld and Mr. Gape, they're my old friends, and they knows\nme. And they knows the way of a commercial room--which some gentlemen\ndon't seem as though they do. I don't want to insult no one; but\nas chairman here at this conwivial meeting, I asks that gentleman\nwho says he is a solicitor whether he means to pay his dinner bill\naccording to the rules of the room, or whether he don't?\"\n\n\"I've paid for what I've had already,\" said Dockwrath, \"and I don't\nmean to pay for what I've not had.\"\n\n\"James,\" exclaimed Moulder,--and all the chairman was in his voice\nas he spoke,--\"my compliments to Mr. Crump, and I will request his\nattendance for five minutes;\" and then James left the room, and there\nwas silence for a while, during which the bottles made their round of\nthe table.\n\n\"Hadn't we better send back the pint of wine which Mr. Dockwrath\nhasn't used?\" suggested Kantwise.\n\n\"I'm d---- if we do!\" replied Moulder, with much energy; and the\ngeneral silence was not again broken till Mr. Crump made his\nappearance; but the chairman whispered a private word or two to his\nfriend Snengkeld. \"I never sent back ordered liquor to the bar yet,\nunless it was bad; and I'm not going to begin now.\"\n\nAnd then Mr. Crump came in. Mr. Crump was a very clean-looking\nperson, without any beard; and dressed from head to foot in black. He\nwas about fifty, with grizzly gray hair, which stood upright on his\nhead, and his face at the present moment wore on it an innkeeper's\nsmile. But it could also assume an innkeeper's frown, and on\noccasions did so--when bills were disputed, or unreasonable strangers\nthought that they knew the distance in posting miles round the\nneighbourhood of Leeds better than did he, Mr. Crump, who had lived\nat the Bull Inn all his life. But Mr. Crump rarely frowned on\ncommercial gentlemen, from whom was derived the main stay of his\nbusiness and the main prop of his house.\n\n\"Mr. Crump,\" began Moulder, \"here has occurred a very unpleasant\ntransaction.\"\n\n\"I know all about it, gentlemen,\" said Mr. Crump. \"The waiter has\nacquainted me, and I can assure you, gentlemen, that I am extremely\nsorry that anything should have arisen to disturb the harmony of your\ndinner-table.\"\n\n\"We must now call upon you, Mr. Crump,\" began Mr. Moulder, who was\nabout to demand that Dockwrath should be turned bodily out of the\nroom.\n\n\"If you'll allow me one moment, Mr. Moulder,\" continued Mr. Crump,\n\"and I'll tell you what is my suggestion. The gentleman here, who I\nunderstand is a lawyer, does not wish to comply with the rules of the\ncommercial room.\"\n\n\"I certainly don't wish or intend to pay for drink that I didn't\norder and haven't had,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Mr. Crump. \"And therefore, gentlemen, to get out of\nthe difficulty, we'll presume, if you please, that the bill is paid.\"\n\n\"The lawyer, as you call him, will have to leave the room,\" said\nMoulder.\n\n\"Perhaps he will not object to step over to the coffee-room on the\nother side,\" suggested the landlord.\n\n\"I can't think of leaving my seat here under such circumstances,\"\nsaid Dockwrath.\n\n\"You can't,\" said Moulder. \"Then you must be made, as I take it.\"\n\n\"Let me see the man that will make me,\" said Dockwrath.\n\nMr. Crump looked very apologetic and not very comfortable. \"There\nis a difficulty, gentlemen; there is a difficulty, indeed,\" he said.\n\"The fact is, the gentleman should not have been showed into the room\nat all;\" and he looked very angrily at his own servant, James.\n\n\"He said he was 'mercial,\" said James. \"So he did. Now he says as how\nhe's a lawyer. What's a poor man to do?\"\n\n\"I'm a commercial lawyer,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"He must leave the room, or I shall leave the house,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" said Crump. \"This kind of thing does not\nhappen often, and on this occasion I must try your kind patience. If\nMr. Moulder would allow me to suggest that the commercial gentlemen\nshould take their wine in the large drawing-room up stairs this\nevening, Mrs. C. will do her best to make it comfortable for them in\nfive minutes. There of course they can be private.\"\n\nThere was something in the idea of leaving Mr. Dockwrath alone in his\nglory which appeased the spirit of the great Moulder. He had known\nCrump, moreover, for many years, and was aware that it would be a\ndangerous, and probably an expensive proceeding to thrust out the\nattorney by violence. \"If the other gentlemen are agreeable, I am,\"\nsaid he. The other gentlemen were agreeable, and, with the exception\nof Kantwise, they all rose from their chairs.\n\n\"I must say I think you ought to leave the room as you don't\nchoose to abide by the rules,\" said Johnson, addressing himself to\nDockwrath.\n\n\"That's your opinion,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Johnson. \"That's my opinion.\"\n\n\"My own happens to be different,\" said Dockwrath; and so he kept his\nchair.\n\n\"There, Mr. Crump,\" said Moulder, taking half a crown from his pocket\nand throwing it on the table. \"I sha'n't see you at a loss.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Mr. Crump; and he very humbly took up the\nmoney.\n\n\"I keep a little account for charity at home,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"It don't run very high, do it?\" asked Snengkeld, jocosely.\n\n\"Not out of the way, it don't. But now I shall have the pleasure of\nwriting down in it that I paid half a crown for a lawyer who couldn't\nafford to settle his own dinner bill. Sir, we have the pleasure of\nwishing you a good night.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll find the large drawing-room up stairs quite\ncomfortable,\" said Dockwrath.\n\nAnd then they all marched out of the room, each with his own glass,\nMr. Moulder leading the way with stately step. It was pleasant to see\nthem as they all followed their leader across the open passage of the\ngateway, in by the bar, and so up the chief staircase. Mr. Moulder\nwalked slowly, bearing the bottle of port and his own glass, and\nMr. Snengkeld and Mr. Gape followed in line, bearing also their\nown glasses, and maintaining the dignity of their profession under\ncircumstances of some difficulty.\n\n[Illustration: And then they all marched out of the room,\neach with his own glass.]\n\n\"Gentlemen, I really am sorry for this little accident,\" said Mr.\nCrump, as they were passing the bar; \"but a lawyer, you know--\"\n\n\"And such a lawyer, eh, Crump?\" said Moulder.\n\n\"It might be five-and-twenty pound to me to lay a hand on him!\" said\nthe landlord.\n\nWhen the time came for Mr. Kantwise to move, he considered the matter\nwell. The chances, however, as he calculated them, were against any\nprofitable business being done with the attorney, so he also left the\nroom. \"Good night, sir,\" he said as he went. \"I wish you a very good\nnight.\"\n\n\"Take care of yourself,\" said Dockwrath; and then the attorney spent\nthe rest of the evening alone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nMR., MRS., AND MISS FURNIVAL.\n\n\nI will now ask my readers to come with me up to London, in order\nthat I may introduce them to the family of the Furnivals. We shall\nsee much of the Furnivals before we reach the end of our present\nundertaking, and it will be well that we should commence our\nacquaintance with them as early as may be done.\n\nMr. Furnival was a lawyer--I mean a barrister--belonging to Lincoln's\nInn, and living at the time at which our story is supposed to\ncommence in Harley Street. But he had not been long a resident in\nHarley Street, having left the less fashionable neighbourhood of\nRussell Square only two or three years before that period. On his\nmarriage he had located himself in a small house in Keppel Street,\nand had there remained till professional success, long waited for,\nenabled him to move further west, and indulge himself with the\ncomforts of larger rooms and more servants. At the time of which I am\nnow speaking Mr. Furnival was known, and well known, as a successful\nman; but he had struggled long and hard before that success had come\nto him, and during the earliest years of his married life had found\nthe work of keeping the wolf from the door to be almost more than\nenough for his energies.\n\nMr. Furnival practised at the common law bar, and early in life had\nattached himself to the home circuit. I cannot say why he obtained no\ngreat success till he was nearer fifty than forty years of age. At\nthat time I fancy that barristers did not come to their prime till\na period of life at which other men are supposed to be in their\ndecadence. Nevertheless, he had married on nothing, and had kept the\nwolf from the door. To do this he had been constant at his work in\nseason and out of season, during the long hours of day and the long\nhours of night. Throughout his term times he had toiled in court,\nand during the vacations he had toiled out of court. He had reported\nvolumes of cases, having been himself his own short-hand writer,--as\nit is well known to most young lawyers, who as a rule always fill\nan upper shelf in their law libraries with Furnival and Staples'\nseventeen volumes in calf. He had worked for the booksellers, and for\nthe newspapers, and for the attorneys,--always working, however, with\nreference to the law; and though he had worked for years with the\nlowest pay, no man had heard him complain. That no woman had heard\nhim do so, I will not say; as it is more than probable that into the\nsympathising ears of Mrs. Furnival he did pour forth plaints as to\nthe small wages which the legal world meted out to him in return for\nhis labours. He was a constant, hard, patient man, and at last there\ncame to him the full reward of all his industry. What was the special\ncase by which Mr. Furnival obtained his great success no man could\nsay. In all probability there was no special case. Gradually it\nbegan to be understood that he was a safe man, understanding his\ntrade, true to his clients, and very damaging as an opponent. Legal\ngentlemen are, I believe, quite as often bought off as bought up. Sir\nRichard and Mr. Furnival could not both be required on the same side,\nseeing what a tower of strength each was in himself; but then Sir\nRichard would be absolutely neutralized if Mr. Furnival were employed\non the other side. This is a system well understood by attorneys, and\nhas been found to be extremely lucrative by gentlemen leading at the\nbar.\n\nMr. Furnival was now fifty-five years of age, and was beginning\nto show in his face some traces of his hard work. Not that he was\nbecoming old, or weak, or worn; but his eye had lost its fire--except\nthe fire peculiar to his profession; and there were wrinkles in his\nforehead and cheeks; and his upper lip, except when he was speaking,\nhung heavily over the lower; and the loose skin below his eye was\nforming into saucers; and his hair had become grizzled; and on his\nshoulders, except when in court, there was a slight stoop. As seen in\nhis wig and gown he was a man of commanding presence,--and for ten\nmen in London who knew him in this garb, hardly one knew him without\nit. He was nearly six feet high, and stood forth prominently, with\nsquare, broad shoulders and a large body. His head also was large;\nhis forehead was high, and marked strongly by signs of intellect; his\nnose was long and straight, his eyes were very gray, and capable to\nan extraordinary degree both of direct severity and of concealed\nsarcasm. Witnesses have been heard to say that they could endure\nall that Mr. Furnival could say to them, and continue in some sort\nto answer all his questions, if only he would refrain from looking\nat them. But he would never refrain; and therefore it was now well\nunderstood how great a thing it was to secure the services of Mr.\nFurnival. \"Sir,\" an attorney would say to an unfortunate client\ndoubtful as to the expenditure, \"your witnesses will not be able to\nstand in the box if we allow Mr. Furnival to be engaged on the other\nside.\" I am inclined to think that Mr. Furnival owed to this power of\nhis eyes his almost unequalled perfection in that peculiar branch of\nhis profession. His voice was powerful, and not unpleasant when used\nwithin the precincts of a court, though it grated somewhat harshly on\nthe ears in the smaller compass of a private room. His flow of words\nwas free and good, and seemed to come from him without the slightest\neffort. Such at least was always the case with him when standing\nwigged and gowned before a judge. Latterly, however, he had tried his\neloquence on another arena, and not altogether with equal success. He\nwas now in Parliament, sitting as member for the Essex Marshes, and\nhe had not as yet carried either the country or the House with him,\nalthough he had been frequently on his legs. Some men said that\nwith a little practice he would yet become very serviceable as an\nhonourable and learned member; but others expressed a fear that he\nhad come too late in life to these new duties.\n\nI have spoken of Mr. Furnival's great success in that branch of\nhis profession which required from him the examination of evidence,\nbut I would not have it thought that he was great only in this, or\neven mainly in this. There are gentlemen at the bar, among whom\nI may perhaps notice my old friend Mr. Chaffanbrass as the most\nconspicuous, who have confined their talents to the browbeating\nof witnesses,--greatly to their own profit, and no doubt to the\nadvantage of society. But I would have it understood that Mr.\nFurnival was by no means one of these. He had been no Old Bailey\nlawyer, devoting himself to the manumission of murderers, or the\nsecurity of the swindling world in general. He had been employed on\nabstruse points of law, had been great in will cases, very learned as\nto the rights of railways, peculiarly apt in enforcing the dowries of\nmarried women, and successful above all things in separating husbands\nand wives whose lives had not been passed in accordance with the\nrecognised rules of Hymen. Indeed there is no branch of the Common\nLaw in which he was not regarded as great and powerful, though\nperhaps his proficiency in damaging the general characters of his\nopponents has been recognised as his especial forte. Under these\ncircumstances I should grieve to have him confounded with such men\nas Mr. Chaffanbrass, who is hardly known by the profession beyond\nthe precincts of his own peculiar court in the City. Mr. Furnival's\nreputation has spread itself wherever stuff gowns and horsehair wigs\nare held in estimation.\n\nMr. Furnival when clothed in his forensic habiliments certainly\npossessed a solemn and severe dignity which had its weight even with\nthe judges. Those who scrutinised his appearance critically might\nhave said that it was in some respects pretentious; but the ordinary\njurymen of this country are not critical scrutinisers of appearance,\nand by them he was never held in light estimation. When in his\naddresses to them, appealing to their intelligence, education, and\nenlightened justice, he would declare that the property of his\nclients was perfectly safe in their hands, he looked to be such an\nadvocate as a litigant would fain possess when dreading the soundness\nof his own cause. Any cause was sound to him when once he had been\nfeed for its support, and he carried in his countenance his assurance\nof this soundness,--and the assurance of unsoundness in the cause of\nhis opponent. Even he did not always win; but on the occasion of his\nlosing, those of the uninitiated who had heard the pleadings would\nexpress their astonishment that he should not have been successful.\n\nWhen he was divested of his wig his appearance was not so perfect.\nThere was then a hard, long straightness about his head and face,\ngiving to his countenance the form of a parallelogram, to which there\nbelonged a certain meanness of expression. He wanted the roundness of\nforehead, the short lines, and the graceful curves of face which are\nnecessary to unadorned manly comeliness. His whiskers were small,\ngrizzled, and ill grown, and required the ample relief of his wig.\nIn no guise did he look other than a clever man; but in his dress as\na simple citizen he would perhaps be taken as a clever man in whose\ntenderness of heart and cordiality of feeling one would not at first\nsight place implicit trust.\n\nAs a poor man Mr. Furnival had done his duty well by his wife and\nfamily,--for as a poor man he had been blessed with four children.\nThree of these had died as they were becoming men and women, and now,\nas a rich man, he was left with one daughter, an only child. As a\npoor man Mr. Furnival had been an excellent husband, going forth\nin the morning to his work, struggling through the day, and then\nreturning to his meagre dinner and his long evenings of unremitting\ndrudgery. The bodily strength which had supported him through his\nwork in those days must have been immense, for he had allowed himself\nno holidays. And then success and money had come,--and Mrs. Furnival\nsometimes found herself not quite so happy as she had been when\nwatching beside him in the days of their poverty.\n\nThe equal mind,--as mortal Delius was bidden to remember, and as Mr.\nFurnival might also have remembered had time been allowed him to\ncultivate the classics,--the equal mind should be as sedulously\nmaintained when things run well, as well as when they run hardly;\nand perhaps the maintenance of such equal mind is more difficult in\nthe former than in the latter stage of life. Be that as it may, Mr.\nFurnival could now be very cross on certain domestic occasions, and\ncould also be very unjust. And there was worse than this,--much worse\nbehind. He, who in the heyday of his youth would spend night after\nnight poring over his books, copying out reports, and never asking to\nsee a female habiliment brighter or more attractive than his wife's\nSunday gown, he, at the age of fifty-five, was now running after\nstrange goddesses! The member for the Essex Marshes, in these his\nlatter days, was obtaining for himself among other successes the\ncharacter of a Lothario; and Mrs. Furnival, sitting at home in her\ngenteel drawing-room near Cavendish Square, would remember with\nregret the small dingy parlour in Keppel Street.\n\nMrs. Furnival in discussing her grievances would attribute them\nmainly to port wine. In his early days Mr. Furnival had been\nessentially an abstemious man. Young men who work fifteen hours a day\nmust be so. But now he had a strong opinion about certain Portuguese\nvintages, was convinced that there was no port wine in London equal\nto the contents of his own bin, saving always a certain green cork\nappertaining to his own club, which was to be extracted at the rate\nof thirty shillings a cork. And Mrs. Furnival attributed to these\nlatter studies not only a certain purple hue which was suffusing his\nnose and cheeks, but also that unevenness of character and those\nsupposed domestic improprieties to which allusion has been made. It\nmay, however, be as well to explain that Mrs. Ball, the old family\ncook and housekeeper, who had ascended with the Furnivals in the\nworld, opined that made-dishes did the mischief. He dined out too\noften, and was a deal too particular about his dinner when he dined\nat home. If Providence would see fit to visit him with a sharp attack\nof the gout, it would--so thought Mrs. Ball--be better for all\nparties.\n\nWhether or no it may have been that Mrs. Furnival at fifty-five--for\nshe and her lord were of the same age--was not herself as attractive\nin her husband's eyes as she had been at thirty, I will not pretend\nto say. There can have been no just reason for any such change in\nfeeling, seeing that the two had grown old together. She, poor woman,\nwould have been quite content with the attentions of Mr. Furnival,\nthough his hair was grizzled and his nose was blue; nor did she ever\nthink of attracting to herself the admiration of any swain whose\ngeneral comeliness might be more free from all taint of age. Why then\nshould he wander afield--at the age of fifty-five? That he did wander\nafield, poor Mrs. Furnival felt in her agony convinced; and among\nthose ladies whom on this account she most thoroughly detested was\nour friend Lady Mason of Orley Farm. Lady Mason and the lawyer had\nfirst become acquainted in the days of the trial, now long gone\nby, on which occasion Mr. Furnival had been employed as the junior\ncounsel; and that acquaintance had ripened into friendship, and now\nflourished in full vigour,--to Mrs. Furnival's great sorrow and\ndisturbance.\n\nMrs. Furnival herself was a stout, solid woman, sensible on most\npoints, but better adapted, perhaps, to the life in Keppel Street\nthan that to which she had now been promoted. As Kitty Blacker she\nhad possessed feminine charms which would have been famous had\nthey been better known. Mr. Furnival had fetched her from farther\nEast--from the region of Great Ormond street and the neighbourhood of\nSouthampton Buildings. Her cherry cheeks, and her round eye, and her\nfull bust, and her fresh lip, had conquered the hard-tasked lawyer;\nand so they had gone forth to fight the world together. Her eye\nwas still round, and her cheek red, and her bust full,--there had\ncertainly been no falling off there; nor will I say that her lip had\nlost its freshness. But the bloom of her charms had passed away, and\nshe was now a solid, stout, motherly woman, not bright in converse,\nbut by no means deficient in mother-wit, recognizing well the duties\nwhich she owed to others, but recognizing equally well those which\nothers owed to her. All the charms of her youth--had they not been\ngiven to him, and also all her solicitude, all her anxious fighting\nwith the hard world? When they had been poor together, had she not\npatched and turned and twisted, sitting silently by his side into the\nlong nights, because she would not ask him for the price of a new\ndress? And yet now, now that they were rich--? Mrs. Furnival, when\nshe put such questions within her own mind, could hardly answer this\nlatter one with patience. Others might be afraid of the great Mr.\nFurnival in his wig and gown; others might be struck dumb by his\npower of eye and mouth; but she, she, the wife of his bosom, she\ncould catch him without his armour. She would so catch him and let\nhim know what she thought of all her wrongs. So she said to herself\nmany a day, and yet the great deed, in all its explosiveness, had\nnever yet been done. Small attacks of words there had been many, but\nhitherto the courage to speak out her griefs openly had been wanting\nto her.\n\nI can now allow myself but a small space to say a few words of Sophia\nFurnival, and yet in that small space must be confined all the direct\ndescription which can be given of one of the principal personages\nof this story. At nineteen Miss Furnival was in all respects a\nyoung woman. She was forward in acquirements, in manner, in general\nintelligence, and in powers of conversation. She was a handsome, tall\ngirl, with expressive gray eyes and dark-brown hair. Her mouth, and\nhair, and a certain motion of her neck and turn of her head, had come\nto her from her mother, but her eyes were those of her father: they\nwere less sharp perhaps, less eager after their prey; but they were\nbright as his had been bright, and sometimes had in them more of\nabsolute command than he was ever able to throw into his own.\n\nTheir golden days had come on them at a period of her life which\nenabled her to make a better use of them than her mother could do.\nShe never felt herself to be struck dumb by rank or fashion, nor did\nshe in the drawing-rooms of the great ever show signs of an Eastern\norigin. She could adapt herself without an effort to the manners of\nCavendish Square;--ay, and if need were, to the ways of more glorious\nsquares even than that. Therefore was her father never ashamed to be\nseen with her on his arm in the houses of his new friends, though on\nsuch occasions he was willing enough to go out without disturbing the\nrepose of his wife. No mother could have loved her children with a\nwarmer affection than that which had warmed the heart of poor Mrs.\nFurnival; but under such circumstances as these was it singular that\nshe should occasionally become jealous of her own daughter?\n\nSophia Furnival was, as I have said, a clever, attractive girl,\nhandsome, well-read, able to hold her own with the old as well as\nwith the young, capable of hiding her vanity if she had any, mild\nand gentle to girls less gifted, animated in conversation, and yet\npossessing an eye that could fall softly to the ground, as a woman's\neye always should fall upon occasions.\n\nNevertheless she was not altogether charming. \"I don't feel quite\nsure that she is real,\" Mrs. Orme had said of her, when on a certain\noccasion Miss Furnival had spent a day and a night at The Cleeve.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nMRS. FURNIVAL AT HOME.\n\n\nLucius Mason on his road to Liverpool had passed through London,\nand had found a moment to call in Harley Street. Since his return\nfrom Germany he had met Miss Furnival both at home at his mother's\nhouse--or rather his own--and at The Cleeve. Miss Furnival had been\nin the neighbourhood, and had spent two days with the great people at\nThe Cleeve, and one day with the little people at Orley Farm. Lucius\nMason had found that she was a sensible girl, capable of discussing\ngreat subjects with him; and had possibly found some other charms in\nher. Therefore he had called in Harley Street.\n\nOn that occasion he could only call as he passed through London\nwithout delay; but he received such encouragement as induced him to\nspend a night in town on his return, in order that he might accept an\ninvitation to drink tea with the Furnivals. \"We shall be very happy\nto see you,\" Mrs. Furnival had said, backing the proposition which\nhad come from her daughter without any very great fervour; \"but I\nfear Mr. Furnival will not be at home. Mr. Furnival very seldom is at\nhome now.\" Young Mason did not much care for fervour on the part of\nSophia's mother, and therefore had accepted the invitation, though he\nwas obliged by so doing to curtail by some hours his sojourn among\nthe guano stores of Liverpool.\n\nIt was the time of year at which few people are at home in London,\nbeing the middle of October; but Mrs. Furnival was a lady of whom at\nsuch periods it was not very easy to dispose. She could have made\nherself as happy as a queen even at Margate, if it could have suited\nFurnival and Sophia to be happy at Margate with her. But this did not\nsuit Furnival or Sophia. As regards money, any or almost all other\nautumnal resorts were open to her, but she could be contented at\nnone of them because Mr. Furnival always pleaded that business--law\nbusiness or political business--took him elsewhere. Now Mrs. Furnival\nwas a woman who did not like to be deserted, and who could not, in\nthe absence of those social joys which Providence had vouchsafed to\nher as her own, make herself happy with the society of other women\nsuch as herself. Furnival was her husband, and she wanted him to\ncarve for her, to sit opposite to her at the breakfast table, to tell\nher the news of the day, and to walk to church with her on Sundays.\nThey had been made one flesh and one bone, for better and worse,\nthirty years since; and now in her latter days she could not put up\nwith disseveration and dislocation.\n\nShe had gone down to Brighton in August, soon after the House broke\nup, and there found that very handsome apartments had been taken for\nher--rooms that would have made glad the heart of many a lawyer's\nwife. She had, too, the command of a fly, done up to look like\na private brougham, a servant in livery, the run of the public\nassembly-rooms, a sitting in the centre of the most fashionable\nchurch in Brighton--all that the heart of woman could desire. All\nbut the one thing was there; but, that one thing being absent, she\ncame moodily back to town at the end of September. She would have\nexchanged them all with a happy heart for very moderate accommodation\nat Margate, could she have seen Mr. Furnival's blue nose on the other\nside of the table every morning and evening as she sat over her\nshrimps and tea.\n\nMen who had risen in the world as Mr. Furnival had done do find it\nsometimes difficult to dispose of their wives. It is not that the\nladies are in themselves more unfit for rising than their lords, or\nthat if occasion demanded they would not as readily adapt themselves\nto new spheres. But they do not rise, and occasion does not demand\nit. A man elevates his wife to his own rank, and when Mr. Brown,\non becoming solicitor-general, becomes Sir Jacob, Mrs. Brown also\nbecomes my lady. But the whole set among whom Brown must be more\nor less thrown do not want her ladyship. On Brown's promotion she\ndid not become part of the bargain. Brown must henceforth have two\nexistences--a public and a private existence; and it will be well for\nLady Brown, and well also for Sir Jacob, if the latter be not allowed\nto dwindle down to a minimum.\n\nIf Lady B. can raise herself also, if she can make her own\noccasion--if she be handsome and can flirt, if she be impudent and\ncan force her way, if she have a daring mind and can commit great\nexpenditure, if she be clever and can make poetry, if she can in\nany way create a separate glory for herself, then, indeed, Sir Jacob\nwith his blue nose may follow his own path, and all will be well.\nSir Jacob's blue nose seated opposite to her will not be her summum\nbonum.\n\nBut worthy Mrs. Furnival--and she was worthy--had created for herself\nno such separate glory, nor did she dream of creating it; and\ntherefore she had, as it were, no footing left to her. On this\noccasion she had gone to Brighton, and had returned from it sulky\nand wretched, bringing her daughter back to London at the period of\nLondon's greatest desolation. Sophia had returned uncomplaining,\nremembering that good things were in store for her. She had been\nasked to spend her Christmas with the Staveleys at Noningsby--the\nfamily of Judge Staveley, who lives near Alston, at a very pretty\ncountry place so called. Mr. Furnival had been for many years\nacquainted with Judge Staveley,--had known the judge when he was a\nleading counsel; and now that Mr. Furnival was a rising man, and\nnow that he had a pretty daughter, it was natural that the young\nStaveleys and Sophia Furnival should know each other. But poor Mrs.\nFurnival was too ponderous for this mounting late in life, and she\nhad not been asked to Noningsby. She was much too good a mother to\nrepine at her daughter's promised gaiety. Sophia was welcome to go;\nbut by all the laws of God and man it would behove her lord and\nhusband to eat his mincepie at home.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival was to be back in town this evening,\" the lady said, as\nthough apologizing to young Mason for her husband's absence, when he\nentered the drawing-room, \"but he has not come, and I dare say will\nnot come now.\"\n\nMason did not care a straw for Mr. Furnival. \"Oh! won't he?\" said he.\n\"I suppose business keeps him.\"\n\n\"Papa is very busy about politics just at present,\" said Sophia,\nwishing to make matters smooth in her mother's mind. \"He was obliged\nto be at Romford in the beginning of the week, and then he went down\nto Birmingham. There is some congress going on there, is there not?\"\n\n\"All that must take a great deal of time,\" said Lucius.\n\n\"Yes; and it is a terrible bore,\" said Sophia. \"I know papa finds it\nso.\"\n\n\"Your papa likes it, I believe,\" said Mrs. Furnival, who would not\nhide even her grievances under a bushel.\n\n\"I don't think he likes being so much from home, mamma. Of course he\nlikes excitement, and success. All men do. Do they not, Mr. Mason?\"\n\n\"They all ought to do so, and women also.\"\n\n\"Ah! but women have no sphere, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"They have minds equal to those of men,\" said Lucius, gallantly, \"and\nought to be able to make for themselves careers as brilliant.\"\n\n\"Women ought not to have any spheres,\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"I don't know that I quite agree with you there, mamma.\"\n\n\"The world is becoming a great deal too fond of what you call\nexcitement and success. Of course it is a good thing for a man to\nmake money by his profession, and a very hard thing when he can't do\nit,\" added Mrs. Furnival, thinking of the olden days. \"But if success\nin life means rampaging about, and never knowing what it is to sit\nquiet over his own fireside, I for one would as soon manage to do\nwithout it.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, I don't see why success should always be rampageous.\"\n\n\"Literary women who have achieved a name bear their honours quietly,\"\nsaid Lucius.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Mrs. Furnival. \"I am told that some of them are\nas fond of gadding as the men. As regards the old maids, I don't care\nso much about it; people who are not married may do what they like\nwith themselves, and nobody has anything to say to them. But it\nis very different for married people. They have no business to be\nenticed away from their homes by any success.\"\n\n\"Mamma is all for a Darby and Joan life,\" said Sophia, laughing.\n\n\"No I am not, my dear; and you should not say so. I don't advocate\nanything that is absurd. But I do say that life should be lived at\nhome. That is the best part of it. What is the meaning of home if it\nisn't that?\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Furnival! she had no idea that she was complaining to a\nstranger of her husband. Had any one told her so she would have\ndeclared that she was discussing world-wide topics; but Lucius Mason,\nyoung as he was, knew that the marital shoe was pinching the lady's\ndomestic corn, and he made haste to change the subject.\n\n\"You know my mother, Mrs. Furnival?\"\n\nMrs. Furnival said that she had the honour of acquaintance with Lady\nMason; but on this occasion also she exhibited but little fervour.\n\n\"I shall meet her up in town to-morrow,\" said Lucius. \"She is coming\nup for some shopping.\"\n\n\"Oh! indeed,\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"And then we go down home together. I am to meet her at the chymist's\nat the top of Chancery Lane.\"\n\nNow this was a very unnecessary communication on the part of young\nMason, and also an unfortunate one. \"Oh! indeed,\" said Mrs. Furnival\nagain, throwing her head a little back. Poor woman! she could not\nconceal what was in her mind, and her daughter knew all about it\nimmediately. The truth was this. Mr. Furnival had been for some days\non the move, at Birmingham and elsewhere, and had now sent up sudden\nnotice that he should probably be at home that very night. He should\nprobably be at home that night, but in such case would be compelled\nto return to his friends at Birmingham on the following afternoon.\nNow if it were an ascertained fact that he was coming to London\nmerely with the view of meeting Lady Mason, the wife of his bosom\nwould not think it necessary to provide for him the warmest welcome.\nThis of course was not an ascertained fact; but were there not\nterrible grounds of suspicion? Mr. Furnival's law chambers were in\nOld Square, Lincoln's Inn, close to Chancery Lane, and Lady Mason had\nmade her appointment with her son within five minutes' walk of that\nlocality. And was it not in itself a strange coincidence that Lady\nMason, who came to town so seldom, should now do so on the very day\nof Mr. Furnival's sudden return? She felt sure that they were to meet\non the morrow, but yet she could not declare even to herself that it\nwas an ascertained fact.\n\n\"Oh! indeed,\" she said; and Sophia understood all about it, though\nLucius did not.\n\nThen Mrs. Furnival sank into silence; and we need not follow, word\nfor word, the conversation between the young lady and the young\ngentleman. Mr. Mason thought that Miss Furnival was a very nice girl,\nand was not at all ill pleased to have an opportunity of passing\nan evening in her company; and Miss Furnival thought--. What she\nthought, or what young ladies may think generally about young\ngentlemen, is not to be spoken openly; but it seemed as though she\nalso were employed to her own satisfaction, while her mother sat\nmoody in her own arm-chair. In the course of the evening the footman\nin livery brought in tea, handing it round on a big silver salver,\nwhich also added to Mrs. Furnival's unhappiness. She would have\nliked to sit behind her tea-tray as she used to do in the good\nold hard-working days, with a small pile of buttered toast on\nthe slop-bowl, kept warm by hot water below. In those dear old\nhard-working days, buttered toast had been a much-loved delicacy\nwith Furnival; and she, kind woman, had never begrudged her eyes, as\nshe sat making it for him over the parlour fire. Nor would she have\nbegrudged them now, neither her eyes nor the work of her hands, nor\nall the thoughts of her heart, if he would have consented to accept\nof her handiwork; but in these days Mr. Furnival had learned a relish\nfor other delicacies.\n\nShe also had liked buttered toast, always, however, taking the pieces\nwith the upper crust, in order that the more luscious morsels might\nbe left for him; and she had liked to prepare her own tea leisurely,\nputting in slowly the sugar and cream--skimmed milk it had used to\nbe, dropped for herself with a sparing hand, in order that his large\nbreakfast-cup might be whitened to his liking; but though the milk\nhad been skimmed and scanty, and though the tea itself had been put\nin with a sparing hand, she had then been mistress of the occasion.\nShe had had her own way, and in stinting herself had found her own\nreward. But now--the tea had no flavour now that it was made in the\nkitchen and brought to her, cold and vapid, by a man in livery whom\nshe half feared to keep waiting while she ministered to her own\nwants.\n\nAnd so she sat moody in her arm-chair, cross and sulky, as her\ndaughter thought. But yet there was a vein of poetry in her heart, as\nshe sat there, little like a sibyl as she looked. Dear old days, in\nwhich her cares and solicitude were valued; in which she could do\nsomething for the joint benefit of the firm into which she had been\ntaken as a partner! How happy she had been in her struggles, how\npiteously had her heart yearned towards him when she thought that he\nwas struggling too fiercely, how brave and constant he had been; and\nhow she had loved him as he sat steady as a rock at his grinding\nwork! Now had come the great success of which they had both dreamed\ntogether, of which they had talked as arm in arm they were taking the\nexercise that was so needful to him, walking quickly round Russell\nSquare, quickly round Bloomsbury Square and Bedford Square, and so\nback to the grinding work in Keppel Street. It had come now--all of\nwhich they had dreamed, and more than all they had dared to hope.\nBut of what good was it? Was he happy? No; he was fretful, bilious,\nand worn with toil which was hard to him because he ate and drank\ntoo much; he was ill at ease in public, only half understanding the\npolitical life which he was obliged to assume in his new ambition;\nand he was sick in his conscience--she was sure that must be so: he\ncould not thus neglect her, his loving, constant wife, without some\npangs of remorse. And was she happy? She might have revelled in silks\nand satins, if silks and satins would have done her old heart good.\nBut they would do her no good. How she had joyed in a new dress when\nit had been so hard to come by, so slow in coming, and when he would\ngo with her to the choosing of it! But her gowns now were hardly\nof more interest to her than the joints of meat which the butcher\nbrought to the door with the utmost regularity. It behoved the\nbutcher to send good beef and the milliner to send good silk, and\nthere was an end of it.\n\nNot but what she could have been ecstatic about a full skirt on a\nsmart body if he would have cared to look at it. In truth she was\nstill soft and young enough within, though stout, and solid, and\nsomewhat aged without. Though she looked cross and surly that night,\nthere was soft poetry within her heart. If Providence, who had\nbountifully given, would now by chance mercifully take away those\ngifts, would she not then forgive everything and toil for him again\nwith the same happiness as before? Ah! yes; she could forgive\neverything, anything, if he would only return and be contented to\nsit opposite to her once again. \"O mortal Delius, dearest lord and\nhusband!\" she exclaimed within her own breast, in language somewhat\ndiffering from that of the Roman poet, \"why hast thou not remembered\nto maintain a mind equal in prosperity as it was always equal and\nwell poised in adversity? Oh my Delius, since prosperity has been too\nmuch for thee, may the Lord bless thee once more with the adversity\nwhich thou canst bear--which thou canst bear, and I with thee!\" Thus\ndid she sing sadly within her own bosom,--sadly, but with true poetic\ncadence; while Sophia and Lucius Mason, sitting by, when for a moment\nthey turned their eyes upon her, gave her credit only for the cross\nsolemnity supposed to be incidental to obese and declining years.\n\nAnd then there came a ring at the bell and a knock at the door, and a\nrush along the nether passages, and the lady knew that he of whom she\nhad been thinking had arrived. In olden days she had ever met him in\nthe narrow passage, and, indifferent to the maid, she had hung about\nhis neck and kissed him in the hall. But now she did not stir from\nthe chair. She could forgive him all and run again at the sound of\nhis footstep, but she must first know that such forgiveness and such\nrunning would be welcome.\n\n\"That's papa,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"Don't forget that I have not met him since I have been home from\nGermany,\" said Lucius. \"You must introduce me.\"\n\nIn a minute or two Mr. Furnival opened the door and walked into the\nroom. Men when they arrive from their travels now-a-days have no\nstrippings of greatcoats, no deposits to make of thick shawls and\ndouble gloves, no absolutely necessary changes of raiment. Such had\nbeen the case when he had used to come back cold and weary from the\ncircuits; but now he had left Birmingham since dinner by the late\nexpress, and enjoyed his nap in the train for two hours or so, and\nwalked into his own drawing-room as he might have done had he dined\nin his own dining-room.\n\n\"How are you, Kitty?\" he said to his wife, handing to her the\nforefinger of his right hand by way of greeting. \"Well, Sophy, my\nlove;\" and he kissed his daughter. \"Oh! Lucius Mason. I am very glad\nto see you. I can't say I should have remembered you unless I had\nbeen told. You are very welcome in Harley Street, and I hope you will\noften be here.\"\n\n[Illustration: Mr. Furnival's welcome home.]\n\n\"It's not very often he'd find you at home, Mr. Furnival,\" said the\naggrieved wife.\n\n\"Not so often as I could wish just at present; but things will be\nmore settled, I hope, before very long. How's your mother, Lucius?\"\n\n\"She's pretty well, thank you, sir. I've to meet her in town\nto-morrow, and go down home with her.\"\n\nThere was then silence in the room for a few seconds, during which\nMrs. Furnival looked very sharply at her husband. \"Oh! she's to be in\ntown, is she?\" said Mr. Furnival, after a moment's consideration. He\nwas angry with Lady Mason at the moment for having put him into this\nposition. Why had she told her son that she was to be up in London,\nthus producing conversation and tittle-tattle which made deceit on\nhis part absolutely necessary? Lady Mason's business in London was\nof a nature which would not bear much open talking. She herself, in\nher earnest letter summoning Mr. Furnival up from Birmingham, had\nbesought him that her visit to his chambers might not be made matter\nof discussion. New troubles might be coming on her, but also they\nmight not; and she was very anxious that no one should know that\nshe was seeking a lawyer's advice on the matter. To all this Mr.\nFurnival had given in his adhesion; and yet she had put it into her\nson's power to come to his drawing-room and chatter there of her\nwhereabouts. For a moment or two he doubted; but at the expiration of\nthose moments he saw that the deceit was necessary. \"She's to be in\ntown, is she?\" said he. The reader will of course observe that this\ndeceit was practised, not as between husband and wife with reference\nto an assignation with a lady, but between the lawyer and the outer\nworld with reference to a private meeting with a client. But then it\nis sometimes so difficult to make wives look at such matters in the\nright light.\n\n\"She's coming up for some shopping,\" said Lucius.\n\n\"Oh! indeed,\" said Mrs. Furnival. She would not have spoken if she\ncould have helped it, but she could not help it; and then there\nwas silence in the room for a minute or two, which Lucius vainly\nendeavoured to break by a few indifferent observations to Miss\nFurnival. The words, however, which he uttered would not take the\nguise of indifferent observations, but fell flatly on their ears, and\nat the same time solemnly, as though spoken with the sole purpose of\ncreating sound.\n\n\"I hope you have been enjoying yourself at Birmingham,\" said Mrs.\nFurnival.\n\n\"Enjoyed myself! I did not exactly go there for enjoyment.\"\n\n\"Or at Romford, where you were before?\"\n\n\"Women seem to think that men have no purpose but amusement when they\ngo about their daily work,\" said Mr. Furnival; and then he threw\nhimself back in his arm-chair, and took up the last Quarterly.\n\nLucius Mason soon perceived that all the harmony of the evening had\nin some way been marred by the return of the master of the house, and\nthat he might be in the way if he remained; he therefore took his\nleave.\n\n\"I shall want breakfast punctually at half-past eight to-morrow\nmorning,\" said Mr. Furnival, as soon as the stranger had withdrawn.\n\"I must be in chambers before ten;\" and then he took his candle and\nwithdrew to his own room.\n\nSophia rang the bell and gave the servant the order; but Mrs.\nFurnival took no trouble in the matter whatever. In the olden days\nshe would have bustled down before she went to bed, and have seen\nherself that everything was ready, so that the master of the house\nmight not be kept waiting. But all this was nothing to her now.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nMR. FURNIVAL'S CHAMBERS.\n\n\nMr. Furnival's chambers were on the first floor in a very dingy\nedifice in Old Square, Lincoln's Inn. This square was always dingy,\neven when it was comparatively open and served as the approach from\nChancery Lane to the Lord Chancellor's Court; but now it has been\nbuilt up with new shops for the Vice-Chancellor, and to my eyes it\nseems more dingy than ever.\n\nHe there occupied three rooms, all of them sufficiently spacious\nfor the purposes required, but which were made oppressive by their\ngeneral dinginess and by a smell of old leather which pervaded them.\nIn one of them sat at his desk Mr. Crabwitz, a gentleman who had now\nbeen with Mr. Furnival for the last fifteen years, and who considered\nthat no inconsiderable portion of the barrister's success had been\nattributable to his own energy and genius. Mr. Crabwitz was a\ngenteel-looking man, somewhat over forty years of age, very careful\nas to his gloves, hat, and umbrella, and not a little particular\nas to his associates. As he was unmarried, fond of ladies' society,\nand presumed to be a warm man in money matters, he had his social\nsuccesses, and looked down from a considerable altitude on some men\nwho from their professional rank might have been considered as his\nsuperiors. He had a small bachelor's box down at Barnes, and not\nunfrequently went abroad in the vacations. The door opening into the\nroom of Mr. Crabwitz was in the corner fronting you on the left-hand\nside as you entered the chambers. Immediately on your left was a\nlarge waiting-room, in which an additional clerk usually sat at an\nordinary table. He was not an authorised part of the establishment,\nbeing kept only from week to week; but nevertheless, for the last two\nor three years he had been always there, and Mr. Crabwitz intended\nthat he should remain, for he acted as fag to Mr. Crabwitz. This\nwaiting-room was very dingy, much more so than the clerk's room, and\nboasted of no furniture but eight old leathern chairs and two old\ntables. It was surrounded by shelves which were laden with books and\ndust, which by no chance were ever disturbed. But to my ideas the\nmost dingy of the three rooms was that large one in which the great\nman himself sat; the door of which directly fronted you as you\nentered. The furniture was probably better than that in the other\nchambers, and the place had certainly the appearance of warmth and\nlife which comes from frequent use; but nevertheless, of all the\nrooms in which I ever sat I think it was the most gloomy. There were\nheavy curtains to the windows, which had once been ruby but were now\nbrown; and the ceiling was brown, and the thick carpet was brown, and\nthe books which covered every portion of the wall were brown, and the\npainted wood-work of the doors and windows was of a dark brown. Here,\non the morning with which we have now to deal, sat Mr. Furnival over\nhis papers from ten to twelve, at which latter hour Lady Mason was\nto come to him. The holidays of Mr. Crabwitz had this year been cut\nshort in consequence of his patron's attendance at the great congress\nwhich was now sitting, and although all London was a desert, as he\nhad piteously complained to a lady of his acquaintance whom he had\nleft at Boulogne, he was there in the midst of the desert, and on\nthis morning was sitting in attendance at his usual desk.\n\nWhy Mr. Furnival should have breakfasted by himself at half-past\neight in order that he might be at his chambers at ten, seeing that\nthe engagement for which he had come to town was timed for twelve,\nI will not pretend to say. He did not ask his wife to join him, and\nconsequently she did not come down till her usual time. Mr. Furnival\nbreakfasted by himself, and at ten o'clock he was in his chambers.\nThough alone for two hours he was not idle, and exactly at twelve Mr.\nCrabwitz opened his door and announced Lady Mason.\n\nWhen we last parted with her after her interview with Sir Peregrine\nOrme, she had resolved not to communicate with her friend the\nlawyer,--at any rate not to do so immediately. Thinking on that\nresolve she had tried to sleep that night; but her mind was\naltogether disturbed, and she could get no rest. What, if after\ntwenty years of tranquillity all her troubles must now be\nrecommenced? What if the battle were again to be fought,--with such\ntermination as the chances might send to her? Why was it that she was\nso much greater a coward now than she had been then? Then she had\nexpected defeat, for her friends had bade her not to be sanguine;\nbut in spite of that she had borne up and gone gallantly through the\nordeal. But now she felt that if Orley Farm were hers to give she\nwould sooner abandon it than renew the contest. Then, at that former\nperiod of her life, she had prepared her mind to do or die in the\ncause. She had wrought herself up for the work, and had carried it\nthrough. But having done that work, having accomplished her terrible\ntask, she had hoped that rest might be in store for her.\n\nAs she rose from her bed on the morning after her interview with Sir\nPeregrine, she determined that she would seek counsel from him in\nwhose counsel she could trust. Sir Peregrine's friendship was more\nvaluable to her than that of Mr. Furnival, but a word of advice\nfrom Mr. Furnival was worth all the spoken wisdom of the baronet,\nten times over. Therefore she wrote her letter, and proposed an\nappointment; and Mr. Furnival, tempted as I have said by some evil\nspirit to stray after strange goddesses in these his blue-nosed\ndays, had left his learned brethren at their congress in Birmingham,\nand had hurried up to town to assist the widow. He had left that\ncongress, though the wisest Rustums of the law from all the civilised\ncountries of Europe were there assembled, with Boanerges at their\nhead, that great, old, valiant, learned, British Rustum, inquiring\nwith energy, solemnity, and caution, with much shaking of ponderous\nheads and many sarcasms from those which were not ponderous, whether\nany and what changes might be made in the modes of answering that\ngreat question, \"Guilty or not guilty?\" and that other equally great\nquestion, \"Is it meum or is it tuum?\" To answer which question justly\nshould be the end and object of every lawyer's work. There were\ngreat men there from Paris, very capable, the Ulpians, Tribonians,\nand Papinians of the new empire, armed with the purest sentiments\nexpressed in antithetical and magniloquent phrases, ravishing to\nthe ears, and armed also with a code which, taken in its integrity,\nwould necessarily, as the logical consequence of its clauses, drive\nall injustice from the face of the earth. And there were great\npractitioners from Germany, men very skilled in the use of questions,\nwho profess that the tongue of man, if adequately skilful, may always\nprevail on guilt to disclose itself; who believe in the power of\ntheir own craft to produce truth, as our forefathers believed in\ntorture; and sometimes with the same result. And of course all that\nwas great on the British bench, and all that was famous at the\nBritish bar was there,--men very unlike their German brethren, men\nwho thought that guilt never should be asked to tell of itself,--men\nwho were customarily but unconsciously shocked whenever unwary guilt\ndid tell of itself. Men these were, mostly of high and noble feeling,\nborn and bred to live with upright hearts and clean hands, but taught\nby the peculiar tenets of their profession to think that that which\nwas high and noble in their private intercourse with the world need\nnot also be so esteemed in their legal practice. And there were\nItalians there, good-humoured, joking, easy fellows, who would laugh\ntheir clients in and out of their difficulties; and Spaniards, very\ngrave and serious, who doubted much in their minds whether justice\nmight not best be bought and sold; and our brethren from the United\nStates were present also, very eager to show that in this country\nlaw, and justice also, were clouded and nearly buried beneath their\nwig and gown.\n\nAll these and all this did Mr. Furnival desert for the space of\ntwenty-four hours in order that he might comply with the request of\nLady Mason. Had she known what it was that she was calling on him\nto leave, no doubt she would have borne her troubles for another\nweek,--for another fortnight, till those Rustums at Birmingham had\nbrought their labours to a close. She would not have robbed the\nEnglish bar of one of the warmest supporters of its present mode\nof practice, even for a day, had she known how much that support\nwas needed at the present moment. But she had not known; and Mr.\nFurnival, moved by her woman's plea, had not been hard enough in his\nheart to refuse her.\n\nWhen she entered the room she was dressed very plainly as was her\ncustom, and a thick veil covered her face; but still she was dressed\nwith care. There was nothing of the dowdiness of the lone lorn woman\nabout her, none of that lanky, washed-out appearance which sorrow and\ntrouble so often give to females. Had she given way to dowdiness, or\nsuffered herself to be, as it were, washed out, Mr. Furnival, we may\nsay, would not have been there to meet her;--of which fact Lady Mason\nwas perhaps aware.\n\n\"I am so grateful to you for this trouble,\" she said, as she raised\nher veil, and while he pressed her hand between both his own. \"I can\nonly ask you to believe that I would not have troubled you unless I\nhad been greatly troubled myself.\"\n\nMr. Furnival, as he placed her in an arm-chair by the fireside,\ndeclared his sorrow that she should be in grief, and then he took\nthe other arm-chair himself, opposite to her, or rather close to\nher,--much closer to her than he ever now seated himself to Mrs. F.\n\"Don't speak of my trouble,\" said he, \"it is nothing if I can do\nanything to relieve you.\" But though he was so tender, he did not\nomit to tell her of her folly in having informed her son that she was\nto be in London. \"And have you seen him?\" asked Lady Mason.\n\n\"He was in Harley Street with the ladies last night. But it does not\nmatter. It is only for your sake that I speak, as I know that you\nwish to keep this matter private. And now let us hear what it is. I\ncannot think that there can be anything which need really cause you\ntrouble.\" And he again took her hand,--that he might encourage her.\nLady Mason let him keep her hand for a minute or so, as though she\ndid not notice it; and yet as she turned her eyes to him it might\nappear that his tenderness had encouraged her.\n\nSitting there thus, with her hand in his,--with her hand in his\nduring the first portion of the tale,--she told him all that she\nwished to tell. Something more she told now to him than she had done\nto Sir Peregrine. \"I learned from her,\" she said, speaking about Mrs.\nDockwrath and her husband, \"that he had found out something about\ndates which the lawyers did not find out before.\"\n\n\"Something about dates,\" said Mr. Furnival, looking with all his eyes\ninto the fire. \"You do not know what about dates?\"\n\n\"No; only this; that he said that the lawyers in Bedford Row--\"\n\n\"Round and Crook.\"\n\n\"Yes; he said that they were idiots not to have found it out before;\nand then he went off to Groby Park. He came back last night; but of\ncourse I have not seen her since.\"\n\nBy this time Mr. Furnival had dropped the hand, and was sitting\nstill, meditating, looking earnestly at the fire while Lady Mason\nwas looking earnestly at him. She was trying to gather from his face\nwhether he had seen signs of danger, and he was trying to gather from\nher words whether there might really be cause to apprehend danger.\nHow was he to know what was really inside her mind; what were her\nactual thoughts and inward reasonings on this subject; what private\nknowledge she might have which was still kept back from him? In the\nordinary intercourse of the world when one man seeks advice from\nanother, he who is consulted demands in the first place that he shall\nbe put in possession of all the circumstances of the case. How else\nwill it be possible that he should give advice? But in matters of law\nit is different. If I, having committed a crime, were to confess my\ncriminality to the gentleman engaged to defend me, might he not be\ncalled on to say: \"Then, O my friend, confess it also to the judge;\nand so let justice be done. Ruat coelum, and the rest of it?\" But\nwho would pay a lawyer for counsel such as that?\n\nIn this case there was no question of payment. The advice to be given\nwas to a widowed woman from an experienced man of the world; but,\nnevertheless, he could only make his calculations as to her peculiar\ncase in the way in which he ordinarily calculated. Could it be\npossible that anything had been kept back from him? Were there facts\nunknown to him, but known to her, which would be terrible, fatal,\ndamning to his sweet friend if proved before all the world? He could\nnot bring himself to ask her, but yet it was so material that he\nshould know! Twenty years ago, at the time of the trial, he had at\none time thought,--it hardly matters to tell what, but those thoughts\nhad not been favourable to her cause. Then his mind had altered,\nand he had learned,--as lawyers do learn,--to believe in his own\ncase. And when the day of triumph had come, he had triumphed loudly,\ncommiserating his dear friend for the unjust suffering to which she\nhad been subjected, and speaking in no low or modified tone as to\nthe grasping, greedy cruelty of that man of Groby Park. Nevertheless,\nthrough it all, he had felt that Round and Crook had not made the\nmost of their case.\n\nAnd now he sat, thinking, not so much whether or no she had been in\nany way guilty with reference to that will, as whether the counsel\nhe should give her ought in any way to be based on the possibility\nof her having been thus guilty. Nothing might be so damning to her\ncause as that he should make sure of her innocence, if she were not\ninnocent; and yet he would not ask her the question. If innocent, why\nwas it that she was now so much moved, after twenty years of quiet\npossession?\n\n\"It was a pity,\" he said, at last, \"that Lucius should have disturbed\nthat fellow in the possession of his fields.\"\n\n\"It was; it was!\" she said. \"But I did not think it possible that\nMiriam's husband should turn against me. Would it be wise, do you\nthink, to let him have the land again?\"\n\n\"No, I do not think that. It would be telling him, and telling others\nalso, that you are afraid of him. If he has obtained any information\nthat may be considered of value by Joseph Mason, he can sell it at a\nhigher price than the holding of these fields is worth.\"\n\n\"Would it be well--?\" She was asking a question and then checked\nherself.\n\n\"Would what be well?\"\n\n\"I am so harassed that I hardly know what I am saying. Would it be\nwise, do you think, if I were to pay him anything, so as to keep him\nquiet?\"\n\n\"What; buy him off, you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, yes;--if you call it so. Give him some sum of money in\ncompensation for his land; and on the understanding, you know--,\" and\nthen she paused.\n\n\"That depends on what he may have to sell,\" said Mr. Furnival, hardly\ndaring to look at her.\n\n\"Ah; yes,\" said the widow. And then there was another pause.\n\n\"I do not think that that would be at all discreet,\" said Mr.\nFurnival. \"After all, the chances are that it is all moonshine.\"\n\n\"You think so?\"\n\n\"Yes; I cannot but think so. What can that man possibly have found\namong the old attorney's papers that may be injurious to your\ninterests?\"\n\n\"Ah! I do not know; I understand so little of these things. At the\ntime they told me,--you told me that the law might possibly go\nagainst my boy's rights. It would have been bad then, but it would be\nten times more dreadful now.\"\n\n\"But there were many questions capable of doubt then, which were\ndefinitely settled at the trial. As to your husband's intellect on\nthat day, for instance.\"\n\n\"There could be no doubt as to that.\"\n\n\"No; so it has been proved; and they will not raise that point again.\nCould he have possibly have made a later will?\"\n\n\"No; I am sure he did not. Had he done so it could not have been\nfound among Mr. Usbech's papers; for, as far as I remember, the poor\nman never attended to any business after that day.\"\n\n\"What day?\"\n\n\"The 14th of July, the day on which he was with Sir Joseph.\"\n\nIt was singular, thought the barrister, with how much precision she\nremembered the dates and circumstances. That the circumstances of the\ntrial should be fresh on her memory was not wonderful; but how was\nit that she knew so accurately things which had occurred before the\ntrial,--when no trial could have been expected? But as to this he\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"And you are sure he went to Groby Park?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I have no doubt of it. I am quite sure.\"\n\n\"I do not know that we can do anything but wait. Have you mentioned\nthis to Sir Peregrine?\" It immediately occurred to Lady Mason's mind\nthat it would be by no means expedient, even if it were possible,\nto keep Mr. Furnival in ignorance of anything that she really did;\nand therefore explained that she had seen Sir Peregrine. \"I was so\ntroubled at the first moment that I hardly knew where to turn,\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"You were quite right to go to Sir Peregrine.\"\n\n\"I am so glad you are not angry with me as to that.\"\n\n\"And did he say anything--anything particular?\"\n\n\"He promised that he would not desert me, should there be any new\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"That is well. It is always good to have the countenance of such a\nneighbour as he is.\"\n\n\"And the advice of such a friend as you are.\" And she again put out\nher hand to him.\n\n\"Well; yes. It is my trade, you know, to give advice,\" and he smiled\nas he took it.\n\n\"How should I live through such troubles without you?\"\n\n\"We lawyers are very much abused now-a-days,\" said Mr. Furnival,\nthinking of what was going on down at Birmingham at that very moment;\n\"but I hardly know how the world would get on without us.\"\n\n\"Ah! but all lawyers are not like you.\"\n\n\"Some perhaps worse, and a great many much better. But, as I was\nsaying, I do not think I would take any steps at present. The man\nDockwrath is a vulgar, low-minded, revengeful fellow; and I would\nendeavour to forget him.\"\n\n\"Ah, if I could!\"\n\n\"And why not? What can he possibly have learned to your injury?\" And\nthen as it seemed to Lady Mason that Mr. Furnival expected some reply\nto this question, she forced herself to give him one. \"I suppose that\nhe cannot know anything.\"\n\n\"I tell you what I might do,\" said Mr. Furnival, who was still\nmusing. \"Round himself is not a bad fellow, and I am acquainted with\nhim. He was the junior partner in that house at the time of the\ntrial, and I know that he persuaded Joseph Mason not to appeal to the\nLords. I will contrive, if possible, to see him. I shall be able to\nlearn from him at any rate whether anything is being done.\"\n\n\"And then if I hear that there is not, I shall be comforted.\"\n\n\"Of course; of course.\"\n\n\"But if there is--\"\n\n\"I think there will be nothing of the sort,\" said Mr. Furnival,\nleaving his seat as he spoke.\n\n\"But if there is--I shall have your aid?\" and she slowly rose from\nher chair as she spoke.\n\nMr. Furnival gave her a promise of this, as Sir Peregrine had done\nbefore; and then with her handkerchief to her eyes she thanked him.\nHer tears were not false as Mr. Furnival well saw; and seeing that\nshe wept, and seeing that she was beautiful, and feeling that in her\ngrief and in her beauty she had come to him for aid, his heart was\nsoftened towards her, and he put out his arms as though he would take\nher to his heart--as a daughter. \"Dearest friend,\" he said, \"trust me\nthat no harm shall come to you.\"\n\n\"I will trust you,\" she said, gently stopping the motion of his arm.\n\"I will trust you, altogether. And when you have seen Mr. Round,\nshall I hear from you?\"\n\nAt this moment, as they were standing close together, the door\nopened, and Mr. Crabwitz introduced another lady--who indeed had\nadvanced so quickly towards the door of Mr. Furnival's room, that the\nclerk had been hardly able to reach it before her.\n\n\"Mrs. Furnival, if you please, sir,\" said Mr. Crabwitz.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nGUILTY, OR NOT GUILTY.\n\n\nUnfortunately for Mr. Furnival, the intruder was Mrs.\nFurnival--whether he pleased or whether he did not please. There\nshe was in his law chamber, present in the flesh, a sight pleasing\nneither to her husband nor to her husband's client. She had knocked\nat the outside door, which, in the absence of the fag, had been\nopened by Mr. Crabwitz, and had immediately walked across the passage\ntowards her husband's room, expressing her knowledge that Mr.\nFurnival was within. Mr. Crabwitz had all the will in the world to\nstop her progress, but he found that he lacked the power to stay it\nfor a moment.\n\nThe advantages of matrimony are many and great,--so many and so\ngreat, that all men, doubtless, ought to marry. But even matrimony\nmay have its drawbacks; among which unconcealed and undeserved\njealousy on the part of the wife is perhaps as disagreeable as any.\nWhat is a man to do when he is accused before the world,--before\nany small fraction of the world, of making love to some lady of his\nacquaintance? What is he to say? What way is he to look? \"My love, I\ndidn't. I never did, and wouldn't think of it for worlds. I say it\nwith my hand on my heart. There is Mrs. Jones herself, and I appeal\nto her.\" He is reduced to that! But should any innocent man be so\nreduced by the wife of his bosom?\n\nI am speaking of undeserved jealousy, and it may therefore be thought\nthat my remarks do not apply to Mrs. Furnival. They do apply to\nher as much as to any woman. That general idea as to the strange\ngoddesses was on her part no more than a suspicion: and all women who\nso torment themselves and their husbands may plead as much as she\ncould. And for this peculiar idea as to Lady Mason she had no ground\nwhatever. Lady Mason may have had her faults, but a propensity to rob\nMrs. Furnival of her husband's affections had not hitherto been one\nof them. Mr. Furnival was a clever lawyer, and she had great need of\nhis assistance; therefore she had come to his chambers, and therefore\nshe had placed her hand in his. That Mr. Furnival liked his client\nbecause she was good looking may be true. I like my horse, my\npicture, the view from my study window for the same reason. I am\ninclined to think that there was nothing more in it than that.\n\n\"My dear!\" said Mr. Furnival, stepping back a little, and letting his\nhands fall to his sides. Lady Mason also took a step backwards, and\nthen with considerable presence of mind recovered herself and put out\nher hand to greet Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"How do you do, Lady Mason?\" said Mrs. Furnival, without any presence\nof mind at all. \"I hope I have the pleasure of seeing you very well.\nI did hear that you were to be in town--shopping; but I did not for a\nmoment expect the--gratification of finding you here.\" And every word\nthat the dear, good, heart-sore woman spoke, told the tale of her\njealousy as plainly as though she had flown at Lady Mason's cap with\nall the bold demonstrative energy of Spitalfields or St. Giles.\n\n\"I came up on purpose to see Mr. Furnival about some unfortunate law\nbusiness,\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"Oh, indeed! Your son Lucius did say--shopping.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Your son Lucius did say--shopping.\"]\n\n\"Yes; I told him so. When a lady is unfortunate enough to be driven\nto a lawyer for advice, she does not wish to make it known. I should\nbe very sorry if my dear boy were to guess that I had this new\ntrouble; or, indeed, if any one were to know it. I am sure that I\nshall be as safe with you, dear Mrs. Furnival, as I am with your\nhusband.\" And she stepped up to the angry matron, looking earnestly\ninto her face.\n\nTo a true tale of woman's sorrow Mrs. Furnival's heart could be as\nsnow under the noonday sun. Had Lady Mason gone to her and told her\nall her fears and all her troubles, sought counsel and aid from her,\nand appealed to her motherly feelings, Mrs. Furnival would have been\nurgent night and day in persuading her husband to take up the widow's\ncase. She would have bade him work his very best without fee or\nreward, and would herself have shown Lady Mason the way to Old\nSquare, Lincoln's Inn. She would have been discreet too, speaking no\nword of idle gossip to any one. When he, in their happy days, had\ntold his legal secrets to her, she had never gossiped,--had never\nspoken an idle word concerning them. And she would have been constant\nto her friend, giving great consolation in the time of trouble, as\none woman can console another. The thought that all this might be so\ndid come across her for a moment, for there was innocence written in\nLady Mason's eyes. But then she looked at her husband's face; and\nas she found no innocence there, her heart was again hardened. The\nwoman's face could lie;--\"the faces of such women are all lies,\" Mrs.\nFurnival said to herself;--but in her presence his face had been\ncompelled to speak the truth.\n\n\"Oh dear, no; I shall say nothing of course,\" she said. \"I am\nquite sorry that I intruded. Mr. Furnival, as I happened to be in\nHolborn--at Mudie's for some books--I thought I would come down and\nask whether you intend to dine at home to-day. You said nothing about\nit either last night or this morning; and nowadays one really does\nnot know how to manage in such matters.\"\n\n\"I told you that I should return to Birmingham this afternoon; I\nshall dine there,\" said Mr. Furnival, very sulkily.\n\n\"Oh, very well. I certainly knew that you were going out of town.\nI did not at all expect that you would remain at home; but I thought\nthat you might, perhaps, like to have your dinner before you\nwent. Good morning, Lady Mason; I hope you may be successful in\nyour--lawsuit.\" And then, curtsying to her husband's client, she\nprepared to withdraw.\n\n\"I believe that I have said all that I need say, Mr. Furnival,\"\nsaid Lady Mason; \"so that if Mrs. Furnival wishes--,\" and she also\ngathered herself up as though she were ready to leave the room.\n\n\"I hardly know what Mrs. Furnival wishes,\" said the husband.\n\n\"My wishes are nothing,\" said the wife, \"and I really am quite sorry\nthat I came in.\" And then she did go, leaving her husband and the\nwoman of whom she was jealous once more alone together. Upon the\nwhole I think that Mr. Furnival was right in not going home that day\nto his dinner.\n\nAs the door closed somewhat loudly behind the angry lady--Mr.\nCrabwitz having rushed out hardly in time to moderate the violence of\nthe slam--Lady Mason and her imputed lover were left looking at each\nother. It was certainly hard upon Lady Mason, and so she felt it.\nMr. Furnival was fifty-five, and endowed with a bluish nose; and she\nwas over forty, and had lived for twenty years as a widow without\nincurring a breath of scandal.\n\n\"I hope I have not been to blame,\" said Lady Mason in a soft, sad\nvoice; \"but perhaps Mrs. Furnival specially wished to find you\nalone.\"\n\n\"No, no; not at all.\"\n\n\"I shall be so unhappy if I think that I have been in the way. If\nMrs. Furnival wished to speak to you on business I am not surprised\nthat she should be angry, for I know that barristers do not usually\nallow themselves to be troubled by their clients in their own\nchambers.\"\n\n\"Nor by their wives,\" Mr. Furnival might have added, but he did not.\n\n\"Do not mind it,\" he said; \"it is nothing. She is the best-tempered\nwoman in the world; but at times it is impossible to answer even for\nthe best-tempered.\"\n\n\"I will trust you to make my peace with her.\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; she will not think of it after to-day; nor must you,\nLady Mason.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; except that I would not for the world be the cause of\nannoyance to my friends. Sometimes I am almost inclined to think that\nI will never trouble any one again with my sorrows, but let things\ncome and go as they may. Were it not for poor Lucius I should do so.\"\n\nMr. Furnival, looking into her face, perceived that her eyes were\nfull of tears. There could be no doubt as to their reality. Her eyes\nwere full of genuine tears, brimming over and running down; and the\nlawyer's heart was melted. \"I do not know why you should say so,\" he\nsaid. \"I do not think your friends begrudge any little trouble they\nmay take for you. I am sure at least that I may so say for myself.\"\n\n\"You are too kind to me; but I do not on that account the less know\nhow much it is I ask of you.\"\n\n\"'The labour we delight in physics pain,'\" said Mr. Furnival\ngallantly. \"But, to tell the truth, Lady Mason, I cannot understand\nwhy you should be so much out of heart. I remember well how brave and\nconstant you were twenty years ago, when there really was cause for\ntrembling.\"\n\n\"Ah, I was younger then.\"\n\n\"So the almanac tells us; but if the almanac did not tell us I should\nnever know. We are all older, of course. Twenty years does not go by\nwithout leaving its marks, as I can feel myself.\"\n\n\"Men do not grow old as women do, who live alone and gather rust as\nthey feed on their own thoughts.\"\n\n\"I know no one whom time has touched so lightly as yourself, Lady\nMason; but if I may speak to you as a friend--\"\n\n\"If you may not, Mr. Furnival, who may?\"\n\n\"I should tell you that you are weak to be so despondent, or rather\nso unhappy.\"\n\n\"Another lawsuit would kill me, I think. You say that I was brave and\nconstant before, but you cannot understand what I suffered. I nerved\nmyself to bear it, telling myself that it was the first duty that I\nowed to the babe that was lying on my bosom. And when standing there\nin the Court, with that terrible array around me, with the eyes of\nall men on me, the eyes of men who thought that I had been guilty of\nso terrible a crime, for the sake of that child who was so weak I\ncould be brave. But it nearly killed me. Mr. Furnival, I could not\ngo through that again; no, not even for his sake. If you can save me\nfrom that, even though it be by the buying off of that ungrateful\nman--\"\n\n\"You must not think of that.\"\n\n\"Must I not? ah me!\"\n\n\"Will you tell Lucius all this, and let him come to me?\"\n\n\"No; not for worlds. He would defy every one, and glory in the fight;\nbut after all it is I that must bear the brunt. No; he shall not know\nit;--unless it becomes so public that he must know it.\"\n\nAnd then, with some further pressing of the hand, and further words\nof encouragement which were partly tender as from the man, and partly\nforensic as from the lawyer, Mr. Furnival permitted her to go,\nand she found her son at the chemist's shop in Holborn as she had\nappointed. There were no traces of tears or of sorrow in her face as\nshe smiled on Lucius while giving him her hand, and then when they\nwere in a cab together she asked him as to his success at Liverpool.\n\n\"I am very glad that I went,\" said he, \"very glad indeed. I saw the\nmerchants there who are the real importers of the article, and I have\nmade arrangements with them.\"\n\n\"Will it be cheaper so, Lucius?\"\n\n\"Cheaper! not what women generally call cheaper. If there be anything\non earth that I hate, it is a bargain. A man who looks for bargains\nmust be a dupe or a cheat, and is probably both.\"\n\n\"Both, Lucius. Then he is doubly unfortunate.\"\n\n\"He is a cheat because he wants things for less than their value; and\na dupe because, as a matter of course, he does not get what he wants.\nI made no bargain at Liverpool,--at least, no cheap bargain; but\nI have made arrangements for a sufficient supply of a first-rate\nunadulterated article at its proper market price, and I do not fear\nbut the results will be remunerative.\" And then, as they went home in\nthe railway carriage the mother talked to her son about his farming\nas though she had forgotten her other trouble, and she explained to\nhim how he was to dine with Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"I shall be delighted to dine with Sir Peregrine,\" said Lucius, \"and\nvery well pleased to have an opportunity of talking to him about his\nown way of managing his land; but, mother, I will not promise to be\nguided by so very old-fashioned a professor.\"\n\nMr. Furnival, when he was left alone, sat thinking over the interview\nthat had passed. At first, as was most natural, he bethought himself\nof his wife; and I regret to say that the love which he bore to her,\nand the gratitude which he owed to her, and the memory of all that\nthey had suffered and enjoyed together, did not fill his heart with\nthoughts towards her as tender as they should have done. A black\nfrown came across his brow as he meditated on her late intrusion,\nand he made some sort of resolve that that kind of thing should be\nprevented for the future. He did not make up his mind how he would\nprevent it,--a point which husbands sometimes overlook in their\nmarital resolutions. And then, instead of counting up her virtues,\nhe counted up his own. Had he not given her everything; a house such\nas she had not dreamed of in her younger days? servants, carriages,\nmoney, comforts, and luxuries of all sorts? He had begrudged her\nnothing, had let her have her full share of all his hard-earned\ngains; and yet she could be ungrateful for all this, and allow her\nhead to be filled with whims and fancies as though she were a young\ngirl,--to his great annoyance and confusion. He would let her know\nthat his chambers, his law chambers, should be private even from her.\nHe would not allow himself to become a laughing-stock to his own\nclerks and his own brethren through the impertinent folly of a woman\nwho owed to him everything;--and so on! I regret to say that he never\nonce thought of those lonely evenings in Harley Street, of those\nlong days which the poor woman was doomed to pass without the only\ncompanionship which was valuable to her. He never thought of that vow\nwhich they had both made at the altar, which she had kept so loyally,\nand which required of him a cherishing, comforting, enduring love.\nIt never occurred to him that in denying her this he as much broke\nhis promise to her as though he had taken to himself in very truth\nsome strange goddess, leaving his wedded wife with a cold ceremony\nof alimony or such-like. He had been open-handed to her as regards\nmoney, and therefore she ought not to be troublesome! He had done his\nduty by her, and therefore he would not permit her to be troublesome!\nSuch, I regret to say, were his thoughts and resolutions as he sat\nthinking and resolving about Mrs. Furnival.\n\nAnd then, by degrees, his mind turned away to that other lady,\nand they became much more tender. Lady Mason was certainly both\ninteresting and comely in her grief. Her colour could still come and\ngo, her hand was still soft and small, her hair was still brown and\nsmooth. There were no wrinkles in her brow though care had passed\nover it; her step could still fall lightly, though it had borne a\nheavy weight of sorrow. I fear that he made a wicked comparison--a\ncomparison that was wicked although it was made unconsciously.\n\nBut by degrees he ceased to think of the woman and began to think of\nthe client, as he was in duty bound to do. What was the real truth\nof all this? Was it possible that she should be alarmed in that way\nbecause a small country attorney had told his wife that he had found\nsome old paper, and because the man had then gone off to Yorkshire?\nNothing could be more natural than her anxiety, supposing her to be\naware of some secret which would condemn her if discovered;--but\nnothing more unnatural if there were no such secret. And she must\nknow! In her bosom, if in no other, must exist the knowledge whether\nor no that will were just. If that will were just, was it possible\nthat she should now tremble so violently, seeing that its justice\nhad been substantially proved in various courts of law? But if it\nwere not just--if it were a forgery, a forgery made by her, or with\nher cognizance--and that now this truth was to be made known! How\nterrible would that be! But terrible is not the word which best\ndescribes the idea as it entered Mr. Furnival's mind. How wonderful\nwould it be; how wonderful would it all have been! By whose hand in\nsuch case had those signatures been traced? Could it be possible that\nshe, soft, beautiful, graceful as she was now, all but a girl as she\nhad then been, could have done it, unaided,--by herself?--that she\ncould have sat down in the still hour of the night, with that old man\non one side and her baby in his cradle on the other, and forged that\nwill, signatures and all, in such a manner as to have carried her\npoint for twenty years,--so skilfully as to have baffled lawyers and\njurymen and resisted the eager greed of her cheated kinsman? If so,\nwas it not all wonderful! Had not she been a woman worthy of wonder!\n\nAnd then Mr. Furnival's mind, keen and almost unerring at seizing\nlegal points, went eagerly to work, considering what new evidence\nmight now be forthcoming. He remembered at once the circumstances of\nthose two chief witnesses, the clerk who had been so muddle-headed,\nand the servant-girl who had been so clear. They had certainly\nwitnessed some deed, and they had done so on that special day. If\nthere had been a fraud, if there had been a forgery, it had been so\nclever as almost to merit protection! But if there had been such\nfraud, the nature of the means by which it might be detected became\nplain to the mind of the barrister,--plainer to him without knowledge\nof any circumstances than it had done to Mr. Mason after many of such\ncircumstances had been explained to him.\n\nBut it was impossible. So said Mr. Furnival to himself, out\nloud;--speaking out loud in order that he might convince himself.\nIt was impossible, he said again; but he did not convince himself.\nShould he ask her? No; it was not on the cards that he should do\nthat. And perhaps, if a further trial were forthcoming, it might be\nbetter for her sake that he should be ignorant. And then, having\ndeclared again that it was impossible, he rang his bell. \"Crabwitz,\"\nsaid he, without looking at the man, \"just step over to Bedford\nRow, with my compliments, and learn what is Mr. Round's present\naddress;--old Mr. Round, you know.\"\n\nMr. Crabwitz stood for a moment or two with the door in his hand, and\nMr. Furnival, going back to his own thoughts, was expecting the man's\ndeparture. \"Well,\" he said, looking up and seeing that his myrmidon\nstill stood there.\n\nMr. Crabwitz was not in a very good humour, and had almost made up\nhis mind to let his master know that such was the case. Looking at\nhis own general importance in the legal world, and the inestimable\nservices which he had rendered to Mr. Furnival, he did not think that\nthat gentleman was treating him well. He had been summoned back to\nhis dingy chamber almost without an excuse, and now that he was in\nLondon was not permitted to join even for a day the other wise men of\nthe law who were assembled at the great congress. For the last four\ndays his heart had been yearning to go to Birmingham, but had yearned\nin vain; and now his master was sending him about town as though he\nwere an errand-lad.\n\n\"Shall I step across to the lodge and send the porter's boy to Round\nand Crook's?\" asked Mr. Crabwitz.\n\n\"The porter's boy! no; go yourself; you are not busy. Why should I\nsend the porter's boy on my business?\" The fact probably was, that\nMr. Furnival forgot his clerk's age and standing. Crabwitz had been\nready to run anywhere when his employer had first known him, and Mr.\nFurnival did not perceive the change.\n\n\"Very well, sir; certainly I will go if you wish it;--on this\noccasion that is. But I hope, sir, you will excuse my saying--\"\n\n\"Saying what?\"\n\n\"That I am not exactly a messenger, sir. Of course I'll go now, as\nthe other clerk is not in.\"\n\n\"Oh, you're too great a man to walk across to Bedford Row, are you?\nGive me my hat, and I'll go.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, Mr. Furnival, I did not mean that. I'll step over to Bedford\nRow, of course;--only I did think--\"\n\n\"Think what?\"\n\n\"That perhaps I was entitled to a little more respect, Mr. Furnival.\nIt's for your sake as much as my own that I speak, sir; but if the\ngentlemen in the Lane see me sent about like a lad of twenty, sir,\nthey'll think--\"\n\n\"What will they think?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what they'll think, but I know it will be very\ndisagreeable, sir;--very disagreeable to my feelings. I did think,\nsir, that perhaps--\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Crabwitz, if your situation here does not\nsuit you, you may leave it to-morrow. I shall have no difficulty in\nfinding another man to take your place.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you speak in that way, Mr. Furnival, very\nsorry--after fifteen years, sir--.\"\n\n\"You find yourself too grand to walk to Bedford Row!\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I'll go now, of course, Mr. Furnival.\" And then Mr. Crabwitz\ndid go, meditating as he went many things to himself. He knew his own\nvalue, or thought that he knew it; and might it not be possible to\nfind some patron who would appreciate his services more justly than\ndid Mr. Furnival?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nDINNER AT THE CLEEVE.\n\n\nLady Mason on her return from London found a note from Mrs. Orme\nasking both her and her son to dine at The Cleeve on the following\nday. As it had been already settled between her and Sir Peregrine\nthat Lucius should dine there in order that he might be talked to\nrespecting his mania for guano, the invitation could not be refused;\nbut, as for Lady Mason herself, she would much have preferred to\nremain at home.\n\nIndeed, her uneasiness on that guano matter had been so outweighed\nby worse uneasiness from another source, that she had become, if not\nindifferent, at any rate tranquil on the subject. It might be well\nthat Sir Peregrine should preach his sermon, and well that Lucius\nshould hear it; but for herself it would, she thought, have been more\ncomfortable for her to eat her dinner alone. She felt, however, that\nshe could not do so. Any amount of tedium would be better than the\ndanger of offering a slight to Sir Peregrine, and therefore she wrote\na pretty little note to say that both of them would be at The Cleeve\nat seven.\n\n\"Lucius, my dear, I want you to do me a great favour,\" she said as\nshe sat by her son in the Hamworth fly.\n\n\"A great favour, mother! of course I will do anything for you that I\ncan.\"\n\n\"It is that you will bear with Sir Peregrine to-night.\"\n\n\"Bear with him! I do not know exactly what you mean. Of course I will\nremember that he is an old man, and not answer him as I would one of\nmy own age.\"\n\n\"I am sure of that, Lucius, because you are a gentleman. As much\nforbearance as that a young man, if he be a gentleman, will always\nshow to an old man. But what I ask is something more than that. Sir\nPeregrine has been farming all his life.\"\n\n\"Yes; and see what are the results! He has three or four hundred\nacres of uncultivated land on his estate, all of which would grow\nwheat.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that,\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"Ah, but that's the question. My trade is to be that of a farmer, and\nyou are sending me to school. Then comes the question, Of what sort\nis the schoolmaster?\"\n\n\"I am not talking about farming now, Lucius.\"\n\n\"But he will talk of it.\"\n\n\"And cannot you listen to him without contradicting him--for my\nsake? It is of the greatest consequence to me,--of the very\ngreatest, Lucius, that I should have the benefit of Sir Peregrine's\nfriendship.\"\n\n\"If he would quarrel with you because I chanced to disagree with\nhim about the management of land, his friendship would not be worth\nhaving.\"\n\n\"I do not say that he will do so; but I am sure you can understand\nthat an old man may be tender on such points. At any rate I ask it\nfrom you as a favour. You cannot guess how important it is to me to\nbe on good terms with such a neighbour.\"\n\n\"It is always so in England,\" said Lucius, after pausing for a while.\n\"Sir Peregrine is a man of family, and a baronet; of course all the\nworld, the world of Hamworth that is, should bow down at his feet.\nAnd I too must worship the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar, the\nKing of Fashion, has set up!\"\n\n\"Lucius, you are unkind to me.\"\n\n\"No, mother, not unkind; but like all men, I would fain act in such\nmatters as my own judgment may direct me.\"\n\n\"My friendship with Sir Peregrine Orme has nothing to do with his\nrank; but it is of importance to me that both you and I should stand\nwell in his sight.\" There was nothing more said on the matter; and\nthen they got down at the front door, and were ushered through the\nlow wide hall into the drawing-room.\n\nThe three generations of the family were there,--Sir Peregrine, his\ndaughter-in-law, and the heir. Lucius Mason had been at The Cleeve\ntwo or three times since his return from Germany, and on going there\nhad always declared to himself that it was the same to him as though\nhe were going into the house of Mrs. Arkwright, the doctor's widow at\nHamworth,--or even into the kitchen of Farmer Greenwood. He rejoiced\nto call himself a democrat, and would boast that rank could have no\neffect on him. But his boast was an untrue boast, and he could not\ncarry himself at The Cleeve as he would have done and did in Mrs.\nArkwright's little drawing-room. There was a majesty in the manner\nof Sir Peregrine which did awe him; there were tokens of birth\nand a certain grace of manner about Mrs. Orme which kept down his\nassumption; and even with young Peregrine he found that though he\nmight be equal he could by no means be more than equal. He had\nlearned more than Peregrine Orme, had ten times more knowledge in his\nhead, had read books of which Peregrine did not even know the names\nand probably never would know them; but on his side also young Orme\npossessed something which the other wanted. What that something might\nbe Lucius Mason did not at all understand.\n\nMrs. Orme got up from her corner on the sofa to greet her friend, and\nwith a soft smile and two or three all but whispered words led her\nforward to the fire. Mrs. Orme was not a woman given to much speech\nor endowed with outward warmth of manners, but she could make her few\nwords go very far; and then the pressure of her hand, when it was\ngiven, told more than a whole embrace from some other women. There\nare ladies who always kiss their female friends, and always call them\n\"dear.\" In such cases one cannot but pity her who is so bekissed.\nMrs. Orme did not kiss Lady Mason, nor did she call her dear; but she\nsmiled sweetly as she uttered her greeting, and looked kindness out\nof her marvellously blue eyes; and Lucius Mason, looking on over his\nmother's shoulders, thought that he would like to have her for his\nfriend in spite of her rank. If Mrs. Orme would give him a lecture on\nfarming it might be possible to listen to it without contradiction;\nbut there was no chance for him in that respect. Mrs. Orme never gave\nlectures to any one on any subject.\n\n\"So, Master Lucius, you have been to Liverpool, I hear,\" said Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"Yes, sir--I returned yesterday.\"\n\n\"And what is the world doing at Liverpool?\"\n\n\"The world is wide awake there, sir.\"\n\n\"Oh, no doubt; when the world has to make money it is always\nwide awake. But men sometimes may be wide awake and yet make no\nmoney;--may be wide awake, or at any rate think that they are so.\"\n\n\"Better that, Sir Peregrine, than wilfully go to sleep when there is\nso much work to be done.\"\n\n\"A man when he's asleep does no harm,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"What a comfortable doctrine to think of when the servant comes with\nthe hot water at eight o'clock in the morning!\" said his grandson.\n\n\"It is one that you study very constantly, I fear,\" said the old man,\nwho at this time was on excellent terms with his heir. There had\nbeen no apparent hankering after rats since that last compact had\nbeen made, and Peregrine had been doing great things with the H. H.;\nwinning golden opinions from all sorts of sportsmen, and earning a\ngreat reputation for a certain young mare which had been bred by Sir\nPeregrine himself. Foxes are vermin as well as rats, as Perry in his\nwickedness had remarked; but a young man who can break an old one's\nheart by a predilection for rat-catching may win it as absolutely\nand irretrievably by prowess after a fox. Sir Peregrine had told to\nfour different neighbours how a fox had been run into, in the open,\nnear Alston, after twelve desperate miles, and how on that occasion\nPeregrine had been in at the death with the huntsman and only one\nother. \"And the mare, you know, is only four years old and hardly\nhalf trained,\" said Sir Peregrine, with great exultation. \"The young\nscamp, to have ridden her in that way!\" It may be doubted whether he\nwould have been a prouder man or said more about it if his grandson\nhad taken honours.\n\nAnd then the gong sounded, and, Sir Peregrine led Lady Mason into the\ndining-room. Lucius, who as we know thought no more of the Ormes than\nof the Joneses and Smiths, paused in his awe before he gave his arm\nto Mrs. Orme; and when he did so he led her away in perfect silence,\nthough he would have given anything to be able to talk to her as\nhe went. But he bethought himself that unfortunately he could find\nnothing to say. And when he sat down it was not much better. He had\nnot dined at The Cleeve before, and I am not sure whether the butler\nin plain clothes and the two men in livery did not help to create his\nconfusion,--in spite of his well-digested democratic ideas.\n\nThe conversation during dinner was not very bright. Sir Peregrine\nsaid a few words now and again to Lady Mason, and she replied with\na few others. On subjects which did not absolutely appertain to the\ndinner, she perhaps was the greatest talker; but even she did not say\nmuch. Mrs. Orme as a rule never spoke unless she were spoken to in\nany company consisting of more than herself and one other; and young\nPeregrine seemed to imagine that carving at the top of the table,\nasking people if they would take stewed beef, and eating his own\ndinner, were occupations quite sufficient for his energies. \"Have a\nbit more beef, Mason; do. If you will, I will.\" So far he went in\nconversation, but no farther while his work was still before him.\n\nWhen the servants were gone it was a little better, but not much.\n\"Mason, do you mean to hunt this season?\" Peregrine asked.\n\n\"No,\" said the other.\n\n\"Well, I would if I were you. You will never know the fellows about\nhere unless you do.\"\n\n\"In the first place I can't afford the time,\" said Lucius, \"and in\nthe next place I can't afford the money.\" This was plucky on his\npart, and it was felt to be so by everybody in the room; but perhaps\nhad he spoken all the truth, he would have said also that he was not\naccustomed to horsemanship.\n\n\"To a fellow who has a place of his own as you have, it costs\nnothing,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"Oh, does it not?\" said the baronet; \"I used to think differently.\"\n\n\"Well; not so much, I mean, as if you had everything to buy. Besides,\nI look upon Mason as a sort of Croesus. What on earth has he got\nto do with his money? And then as to time;--upon my word I don't\nunderstand what a man means when he says he has not got time for\nhunting.\"\n\n\"Lucius intends to be a farmer,\" said his mother.\n\n\"So do I,\" said Peregrine. \"By Jove, I should think so. If I had two\nhundred acres of land in my own hand I should not want anything else\nin the world, and would never ask any one for a shilling.\"\n\n\"If that be so, I might make the best bargain at once that ever a man\nmade,\" said the baronet. \"If I might take you at your word, Master\nPerry--.\"\n\n\"Pray don't talk of it, sir,\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"You may be quite sure of this, my dear--that I shall not do more\nthan talk of it.\" Then Sir Peregrine asked Lady Mason if she would\ntake any more wine; after which the ladies withdrew, and the lecture\ncommenced.\n\nBut we will in the first place accompany the ladies into the\ndrawing-room for a few minutes. It was hinted in one of the first\nchapters of this story that Lady Mason might have become more\nintimate than she had done with Mrs. Orme, had she so pleased it; and\nby this it will of course be presumed that she had not so pleased.\nAll this is perfectly true. Mrs. Orme had now been living at The\nCleeve the greater portion of her life, and had never while there\nmade one really well-loved friend. She had a sister of her own, and\ndear old friends of her childhood, who lived far away from her in\nthe northern counties. Occasionally she did see them, and was then\nvery happy; but this was not frequent with her. Her sister, who was\nmarried to a peer, might stay at The Cleeve for a fortnight, perhaps\nonce in the year; but Mrs. Orme herself seldom left her own home. She\nthought, and certainly not without cause, that Sir Peregrine was not\nhappy in her absence, and therefore she never left him. Then, living\nthere so much alone, was it not natural that her heart should desire\na friend?\n\nBut Lady Mason had been living much more alone. She had no sister to\ncome to her, even though it were but once a year. She had no intimate\nfemale friend, none to whom she could really speak with the full\nfreedom of friendship, and it would have been delightful to have\nbound to her by ties of love so sweet a creature as Mrs. Orme, a\nwidow like herself,--and like herself a widow with one only son. But\nshe, warily picking her steps through life, had learned the necessity\nof being cautious in all things. The countenance of Sir Peregrine had\nbeen invaluable to her, and might it not be possible that she should\nlose that countenance? A word or two spoken now and then again, a\nlook not intended to be noticed, an altered tone, or perhaps a change\nin the pressure of the old man's hand, had taught Lady Mason to think\nthat he might disapprove such intimacy. Probably at the moment she\nwas right, for she was quick at reading such small signs. It behoved\nher to be very careful, and to indulge in no pleasure which might be\ncostly; and therefore she had denied herself in this matter,--as in\nso many others.\n\nBut now it had occurred to her that it might be well to change her\nconduct. Either she felt that Sir Peregrine's friendship for her was\ntoo confirmed to be shaken, or perhaps she fancied that she might\nstrengthen it by means of his daughter-in-law. At any rate she\nresolved to accept the offer which had once been tacitly made to her,\nif it were still open to her to do so.\n\n\"How little changed your boy is!\" she said, when they were seated\nnear to each other, with their coffee-cups between them.\n\n\"No; he does not change quickly; and, as you say, he is a boy still\nin many things. I do not know whether it may not be better that it\nshould be so.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to call him a boy in that sense,\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"But you might; now your son is quite a man.\"\n\n\"Poor Lucius! yes; in his position it is necessary. His little bit\nof property is already his own; and then he has no one like Sir\nPeregrine to look out for him. Necessity makes him manly.\"\n\n\"He will be marrying soon, I dare say,\" suggested Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Oh, I hope not. Do you think that early marriages are good for young\nmen?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think so. Why not?\" said Mrs. Orme, thinking of her own year\nof married happiness. \"Would you not wish to see Lucius marry?\"\n\n\"I fancy not. I should be afraid lest I should become as nothing to\nhim. And yet I would not have you think that I am selfish.\"\n\n\"I am sure that you are not that. I am sure that you love him better\nthan all the world besides. I can feel what that is myself.\"\n\n\"But you are not alone with your boy as I am. If he were to send me\nfrom him, there would be nothing left for me in this world.\"\n\n\"Send you from him! Ah, because Orley Farm belongs to him. But he\nwould not do that; I am sure he would not.\"\n\n\"He would do nothing unkind; but how could he help it if his wife\nwished it? But nevertheless I would not keep him single for that\nreason;--no, nor for any reason if I knew that he wished to marry.\nBut it would be a blow to me.\"\n\n\"I sincerely trust that Peregrine may marry early,\" said Mrs. Orme,\nperhaps thinking that babies were preferable either to rats or foxes.\n\n\"Yes, it would be well I am sure, because you have ample means, and\nthe house is large; and you would have his wife to love.\"\n\n\"If she were nice it would be so sweet to have her for a daughter. I\nalso am very much alone, though perhaps not so much as you are, Lady\nMason.\"\n\n\"I hope not--for I am sometimes very lonely.\"\n\n\"I have often thought that.\"\n\n\"But I should be wicked beyond everything if I were to complain,\nseeing that Providence has given me so much that I had no right to\nexpect. What should I have done in my loneliness if Sir Peregrine's\nhand and door had never been opened to me?\" And then for the next\nhalf-hour the two ladies held sweet converse together, during which\nwe will go back to the gentlemen over their wine.\n\n[Illustration: Over their Wine.]\n\n\"Are you drinking claret?\" said Sir Peregrine, arranging himself and\nhis bottles in the way that was usual to him. He had ever been a\nmoderate man himself, but nevertheless he had a business-like way of\ngoing to work after dinner, as though there was a good deal to be\ndone before the drawing-room could be visited.\n\n\"No more wine for me, sir,\" said Lucius.\n\n\"No wine!\" said Sir Peregrine the elder.\n\n\"Why, Mason, you'll never get on if that's the way with you,\" said\nPeregrine the younger.\n\n\"I'll try at any rate,\" said the other.\n\n\"Water-drinker, moody thinker,\" and Peregrine sang a word or two from\nan old drinking-song.\n\n\"I am not quite sure of that. We Englishmen I suppose are the\nmoodiest thinkers in all the world, and yet we are not so much given\nto water-drinking as our lively neighbours across the Channel.\"\n\nSir Peregrine said nothing more on the subject, but he probably\nthought that his young friend would not be a very comfortable\nneighbour. His present task, however, was by no means that of\nteaching him to drink, and he struck off at once upon the business he\nhad undertaken. \"So your mother tells me that you are going to devote\nall your energies to farming.\"\n\n\"Hardly that, I hope. There is the land, and I mean to see what I\ncan do with it. It is not much, and I intend to combine some other\noccupation with it.\"\n\n\"You will find that two hundred acres of land will give you a good\ndeal to do;--that is if you mean to make money by it.\"\n\n\"I certainly hope to do that,--in the long run.\"\n\n\"It seems to me the easiest thing in the world,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"You'll find out your mistake some day; but with Lucius Mason it is\nvery important that he should make no mistake at the commencement.\nFor a country gentleman I know no prettier amusement than\nexperimental farming;--but then a man must give up all idea of making\nhis rent out of the land.\"\n\n\"I can't afford that,\" said Lucius.\n\n\"No; and that is why I take the liberty of speaking to you. I hope\nthat the great friendship which I feel for your mother will be\nallowed to stand as my excuse.\"\n\n\"I am very much obliged by your kindness, sir; I am indeed.\"\n\n\"The truth is, I think you are beginning wrong. You have now been to\nLiverpool, to buy guano, I believe.\"\n\n\"Yes, that and some few other things. There is a man there who has\ntaken out a patent--\"\n\n\"My dear fellow, if you lay out your money in that way, you will\nnever see it back again. Have you considered in the first place what\nyour journey to Liverpool has cost you?\"\n\n\"Exactly nine and sixpence per cent. on the money that I laid out\nthere. Now that is not much more than a penny in the pound on the sum\nexpended, and is not for a moment to be taken into consideration in\ncomparison with the advantage of an improved market.\"\n\nThere was more in this than Sir Peregrine had expected to encounter.\nHe did not for a moment doubt the truth of his own experience or\nthe folly and the danger of the young man's proceedings; but he did\ndoubt his own power of proving either the one or the other to one\nwho so accurately computed his expenses by percentages on his outlay.\nPeregrine opened his eyes and sat by, wondering in silence. What on\nearth did Mason mean by an improved market?\n\n\"I am afraid then,\" said the baronet, \"that you must have laid out a\nlarge sum of money.\"\n\n\"A man can't do any good, Sir Peregrine, by hoarding his capital. I\ndon't think very much of capital myself--\"\n\n\"Don't you?\"\n\n\"Not of the theory of capital;--not so much as some people do; but\nif a man has got it, of course it should be expended on the trade to\nwhich it is to be applied.\"\n\n\"But some little knowledge--some experience is perhaps desirable\nbefore any great outlay is made.\"\n\n\"Yes; some little knowledge is necessary,--and some great knowledge\nwould be desirable if it were accessible;--but it is not, as I take\nit.\"\n\n\"Long years, perhaps, devoted to such pursuits--\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Peregrine; I know what you are going to say. Experience no\ndoubt will teach something. A man who has walked thirty miles a day\nfor thirty years will probably know what sort of shoes will best suit\nhis feet, and perhaps also the kind of food that will best support\nhim through such exertion; but there is very little chance of his\ninventing any quicker mode of travelling.\"\n\n\"But he will have earned his wages honestly,\" said Sir Peregrine,\nalmost angrily. In his heart he was very angry, for he did not love\nto be interrupted.\n\n\"Oh, yes; and if that were sufficient we might all walk our thirty\nmiles a day. But some of us must earn wages for other people, or the\nworld will make no progress. Civilization, as I take it, consists in\nefforts made not for oneself but for others.\"\n\n\"If you won't take any more wine we will join the ladies,\" said the\nbaronet.\n\n\"He has not taken any at all,\" said Peregrine, filling his own glass\nfor the last time and emptying it.\n\n\"That young man is the most conceited puppy it was ever my misfortune\nto meet,\" said Sir Peregrine to Mrs. Orme, when she came to kiss him\nand take his blessing as she always did before leaving him for the\nnight.\n\n\"I am sorry for that,\" said she, \"for I like his mother so much.\"\n\n\"I also like her,\" said Sir Peregrine; \"but I cannot say that I shall\never be very fond of her son.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, mamma,\" said young Peregrine, the same evening\nin his mother's dressing-room. \"Lucius Mason was too many for the\ngovernor this evening.\"\n\n\"I hope he did not tease your grandfather.\"\n\n\"He talked him down regularly, and it was plain that the governor did\nnot like it.\"\n\nAnd then the day was over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA MORNING CALL AT MOUNT PLEASANT VILLA.\n\n\nOn the following day Lady Mason made two visits, using her new\nvehicle for the first time. She would fain have walked had she dared;\nbut she would have given terrible offence to her son by doing so. He\nhad explained to her, and with some truth, that as their joint income\nwas now a thousand a year, she was quite entitled to such a luxury;\nand then he went on to say that as he had bought it for her, he\nshould be much hurt if she would not use it. She had put it off from\nday to day, and now she could put it off no longer.\n\nHer first visit was by appointment at The Cleeve. She had promised\nMrs. Orme that she would come up, some special purpose having been\nnamed;--but with the real idea, at any rate on the part of the\nlatter, that they might both be more comfortable together than alone.\nThe walk across from Orley Farm to The Cleeve had always been very\ndear to Lady Mason. Every step of it was over beautiful ground, and a\ndelight in scenery was one of the few pleasures which her lot in life\nhad permitted her to enjoy. But to-day she could not allow herself\nthe walk. Her pleasure and delight must be postponed to her son's\nwishes! But then she was used to that.\n\nShe found Mrs. Orme alone, and sat with her for an hour. I do not\nknow that anything was said between them which deserves to be\nspecially chronicled. Mrs. Orme, though she told her many things, did\nnot tell her what Sir Peregrine had said as he was going up to his\nbedroom on the preceding evening, nor did Lady Mason say much about\nher son's farming. She had managed to gather from Lucius that he\nhad not been deeply impressed by anything that had fallen from Sir\nPeregrine on the subject, and therefore thought it as well to hold\nher tongue. She soon perceived also, from the fact of Mrs. Orme\nsaying nothing about Lucius, that he had not left behind him any very\nfavourable impression. This was to her cause of additional sorrow,\nbut she knew that it must be borne. Nothing that she could say would\ninduce Lucius to make himself acceptable to Sir Peregrine.\n\nWhen the hour was over she went down again to her little carriage,\nMrs. Orme coming with her to look at it, and in the hall they met Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"Why does not Lady Mason stop for lunch?\" said he. \"It is past\nhalf-past one. I never knew anything so inhospitable as turning her\nout at this moment.\"\n\n\"I did ask her to stay,\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"But I command her to stay,\" said Sir Peregrine, knocking his stick\nupon the stone floor of the hall. \"And let me see who will dare to\ndisobey me. John, let Lady Mason's carriage and pony stand in the\nopen coach-house till she is ready.\" So Lady Mason went back and did\nremain for lunch. She was painfully anxious to maintain the best\npossible footing in that house, but still more anxious not to have\nit thought that she was intruding. She had feared that Lucius by his\noffence might have estranged Sir Peregrine against herself; but that\nat any rate was not the case.\n\nAfter lunch she drove herself to Hamworth and made her second visit.\nOn this occasion she called on one Mrs. Arkwright, who was a very\nold acquaintance, though hardly to be called an intimate friend.\nThe late Mr. Arkwright,--Dr. Arkwright as he used to be styled\nin Hamworth,--had been Sir Joseph's medical attendant for many\nyears, and therefore there had been room for an intimacy. No real\nfriendship, that is no friendship of confidence, had sprung up; but\nnevertheless the doctor's wife had known enough of Lady Mason in her\nyounger days to justify her in speaking of things which would not\nhave been mentioned between merely ordinary acquaintance. \"I am glad\nto see you have got promotion,\" said the old lady, looking out at\nLady Mason's little phaeton on the gravel sweep which divided Mrs.\nArkwright's house from the street. For Mrs. Arkwright's house was\nMount Pleasant Villa, and therefore was entitled to a sweep.\n\n\"It was a present from Lucius,\" said the other, \"and as such must be\nused. But I shall never feel myself at home in my own carriage.\"\n\n\"It is quite proper, my dear Lady Mason, quite proper. With his\nincome and with yours I do not wonder that he insists upon it. It is\nquite proper, and just at the present moment peculiarly so.\"\n\nLady Mason did not understand this; but she would probably have\npassed it by without understanding it, had she not thought that there\nwas some expression more than ordinary in Mrs. Arkwright's face. \"Why\npeculiarly so at the present moment?\" she said.\n\n\"Because it shows that this foolish report which is going about has\nno foundation. People won't believe it for a moment when they see you\nout and about, and happy-like.\"\n\n\"What rumour, Mrs. Arkwright?\" And Lady Mason's heart sunk within her\nas she asked the question. She felt at once to what it must allude,\nthough she had conceived no idea as yet that there was any rumour on\nthe subject. Indeed, during the last forty-eight hours, since she had\nleft the chambers of Mr. Furnival, she had been more at ease within\nherself than during the previous days which had elapsed subsequent to\nthe ill-omened visit made to her by Miriam Dockwrath. It had seemed\nto her that Mr. Furnival anticipated no danger, and his manner and\nwords had almost given her confidence. But now,--now that a public\nrumour was spoken of, her heart was as low again as ever.\n\n\"Sure, haven't you heard?\" said Mrs. Arkwright. \"Well, I wouldn't be\nthe first to tell you, only that I know that there is no truth in\nit.\"\n\n\"You might as well tell me now, as I shall be apt to believe worse\nthan the truth after what you have said.\"\n\nAnd then Mrs. Arkwright told her. \"People have been saying that Mr.\nMason is again going to begin those law proceedings about the farm;\nbut I for one don't believe it.\"\n\n\"People have said so!\" Lady Mason repeated. She meant nothing; it was\nnothing to her who the people were. If one said it now, all would\nsoon be saying it. But she uttered the words because she felt herself\nforced to say something, and the power of thinking what she might\nbest say was almost taken away from her.\n\n\"I am sure I don't know where it came from,\" said Mrs. Arkwright;\n\"but I would not have alluded to it if I had not thought that of\ncourse you had heard it. I am very sorry if my saying it has vexed\nyou.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Lady Mason, trying to smile.\n\n\"As I said before, we all know that there is nothing in it; and your\nhaving the pony chaise just at this time will make everybody see that\nyou are quite comfortable yourself.\"\n\n\"Thank you, yes; good-bye, Mrs. Arkwright.\" And then she made a great\neffort, feeling aware that she was betraying herself, and that it\nbehoved her to say something which might remove the suspicion which\nher emotion must have created. \"The very name of that lawsuit is so\ndreadful to me that I can hardly bear it. The memory of it is so\nterrible to me, that even my enemies would hardly wish that it should\ncommence again.\"\n\n\"Of course it is merely a report,\" said Mrs. Arkwright, almost\ntrembling at what she had done.\n\n\"That is all--at least I believe so. I had heard myself that some\nsuch threat had been made, but I did not think that any tidings of it\nhad got abroad.\"\n\n\"It was Mrs. Whiting told me. She is a great busybody, you know.\"\nMrs. Whiting was the wife of the present doctor.\n\n\"Dear Mrs. Arkwright, it does not matter in the least. Of course I\ndo not expect that people should hold their tongue on my account.\nGood-bye, Mrs. Arkwright.\" And then she got into the little carriage,\nand did contrive to drive herself home to Orley Farm.\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear, dear!\" said Mrs. Arkwright to herself when she was\nleft alone. \"Only to think of that; that she should be knocked in a\nheap by a few words--in a moment, as we may say.\" And then she began\nto consider of the matter. \"I wonder what there is in it! There must\nbe something, or she would never have looked so like a ghost. What\nwill they do if Orley Farm is taken away from them after all!\" And\nthen Mrs. Arkwright hurried out on her daily little toddle through\nthe town, that she might talk about and be talked to on the same\nsubject. She was by no means an ill-natured woman, nor was she at\nall inclined to direct against Lady Mason any slight amount of venom\nwhich might alloy her disposition. But then the matter was of such\nimportance! The people of Hamworth had hardly yet ceased to talk of\nthe last Orley Farm trial; and would it not be necessary that they\nshould talk much more if a new trial were really pending? Looking at\nthe matter in that light, would not such a trial be a godsend to the\npeople of Hamworth? Therefore I beg that it may not be imputed to\nMrs. Arkwright as a fault that she toddled out and sought eagerly for\nher gossips.\n\nLady Mason did manage to drive herself home; but her success in the\nmatter was more owing to the good faith and propriety of her pony,\nthan to any skilful workmanship on her own part. Her first desire had\nbeen to get away from Mrs. Arkwright, and having made that effort she\nwas now for a time hardly able to make any other. It was fast coming\nupon her now. Let Sir Peregrine say what comforting words he might,\nlet Mr. Furnival assure her that she was safe with ever so much\nconfidence, nevertheless she could not but believe, could not but\nfeel inwardly convinced, that that which she so dreaded was to\nhappen. It was written in the book of her destiny that there should\nbe a new trial.\n\nAnd now, from this very moment, the misery would again begin. People\nwould point at her, and talk of her. Her success in obtaining Orley\nFarm for her own child would again be canvassed at every house in\nHamworth; and not only her success, but the means also by which that\nsuccess had been obtained. The old people would remember and the\nyoung people would inquire; and, for her, tranquillity, repose, and\nthat retirement of life which had been so valuable to her, were all\ngone.\n\nThere could be no doubt that Dockwrath had spread the report\nimmediately on his return from Yorkshire; and had she well thought of\nthe matter she might have taken some comfort from this. Of course he\nwould tell the story which he did tell. His confidence in being able\nagain to drag the case before the Courts would by no means argue that\nothers believed as he believed. In fact the enemies now arraigned\nagainst her were only those whom she already knew to be so arraigned.\nBut she had not sufficient command of her thoughts to be able at\nfirst to take comfort from such a reflection as this. She felt, as\nshe was being carried home, that the world was going from her, and\nthat it would be well for her, were it possible, that she should die.\n\nBut she was stronger when she reached her own door than she had been\nat Mrs. Arkwright's. There was still within her a great power of\nself-maintenance, if only time were allowed to her to look about and\nconsider how best she might support herself. Many women are in this\nrespect as she was. With forethought and summoned patience they can\nendure great agonies; but a sudden pang, unexpected, overwhelms them.\nShe got out of the pony carriage with her ordinary placid face, and\nwalked up to her own room without having given any sign that she was\nuneasy; and then she had to determine how she should bear herself\nbefore her son. It had been with her a great object that both Sir\nPeregrine and Mr. Furnival should first hear of the tidings from her,\nand that they should both promise her their aid when they had heard\nthe story as she would tell it. In this she had been successful; and\nit now seemed to her that prudence would require her to act in the\nsame way towards Lucius. Had it been possible to keep this matter\nfrom him altogether, she would have given much to do so; but now it\nwould not be possible. It was clear that Mr. Dockwrath had chosen to\nmake the matter public, acting no doubt with forethought in doing\nso; and Lucius would be sure to hear words which would become common\nin Hamworth. Difficult as the task would be to her, it would be\nbest that she should prepare him. So she sat alone till dinner-time\nplanning how she would do this. She had sat alone for hours in the\nsame way planning how she would tell her story to Sir Peregrine; and\nagain as to her second story for Mr. Furnival. Those whose withers\nare unwrung can hardly guess how absolutely a sore under the collar\nwill embitter every hour for the poor jade who is so tormented!\n\nBut she met him at dinner with a smiling face. He loved to see her\nsmile, and often told her so, almost upbraiding her when she would\nlook sad. Why should she be sad, seeing that she had everything that\na woman could desire? Her mind was burdened with no heavy thoughts as\nto feeding coming multitudes. She had no contests to wage with the\ndesultory chemists of the age. His purpose was to work hard during\nthe hours of the day,--hard also during many hours of the night; and\nit was becoming that his mother should greet him softly during his\nfew intervals of idleness. He told her so, in some words not badly\nchosen for such telling; and she, loving mother that she was, strove\nvaliantly to obey him.\n\nDuring dinner she could not speak to him, nor immediately after\ndinner. The evil moment she put off from half-hour to half-hour,\nstill looking as though all were quiet within her bosom as she sat\nbeside him with her book in her hand. He was again at work before she\nbegan her story; he thought at least that he was at work, for he had\nbefore him on the table both Prichard and Latham, and was occupied\nin making copies from some drawings of skulls which purposed to\nrepresent the cerebral development of certain of our more distant\nAsiatic brethren.\n\n\"Is it not singular,\" said be, \"that the jaws of men born and bred\nin a hunter state should be differently formed from those of the\nagricultural tribes?\"\n\n\"Are they?\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"Oh yes; the maxillary profile is quite different. You will see this\nespecially with the Mongolians, among the Tartar tribes. It seems to\nme to be very much the same difference as that between a man and a\nsheep, but Prichard makes no such remark. Look here at this fellow;\nhe must have been intended to eat nothing but flesh; and that raw,\nand without any knife or fork.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose they had many knives or forks.\"\n\n\"By close observation I do not doubt that one could tell from a\nsingle tooth not only what food the owner of it had been accustomed\nto eat, but what language he had spoken. I say close observation, you\nknow. It could not be done in a day.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\" And then the student again bent over his drawing.\n\"You see it would have been impossible for the owner of such a jaw\nas that to have ground a grain of corn between his teeth, or to have\nmasticated even a cabbage.\"\n\n\"Lucius,\" said Lady Mason, becoming courageous on the spur of the\nmoment, \"I want you to leave that for a moment and speak to me.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said he, putting down his pencil and turning round. \"Here I\nam.\"\n\n\"You have heard of the lawsuit which I had with your brother when you\nwere an infant?\"\n\n\"Of course I have heard of it; but I wish you would not call that man\nmy brother. He would not own me as such, and I most certainly would\nnot own him. As far as I can learn he is one of the most detestable\nhuman beings that ever existed.\"\n\n\"You have heard of him from an unfavourable side, Lucius; you should\nremember that. He is a hard man, I believe; but I do not know that he\nwould do anything which he thought to be unjust.\"\n\n\"Why then did he try to rob me of my property?\"\n\n\"Because he thought that it should have been his own. I cannot see\ninto his breast, but I presume that it was so.\"\n\n\"I do not presume anything of the kind, and never shall. I was an\ninfant and you were a woman,--a woman at that time without many\nfriends, and he thought that he could rob us under cover of the law.\nHad he been commonly honest it would have been enough for him to\nknow what had been my father's wishes, even if the will had not been\nrigidly formal. I look upon him as a robber and a thief.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that, Lucius, because I differ from you. What I wish\nto tell you now is this,--that he is thinking of trying the question\nagain.\"\n\n\"What!--thinking of another trial now?\" and Lucius Mason pushed his\ndrawings and books from him with a vengeance.\n\n\"So I am told.\"\n\n\"And who told you? I cannot believe it, If he intended anything of\nthe kind I must have been the first person to hear of it. It would be\nmy business now, and you may be sure that he would have taken care to\nlet me know his purpose.\"\n\nAnd then by degrees she explained to him that the man himself, Mr.\nMason of Groby, had as yet declared no such purpose. She had intended\nto omit all mention of the name of Mr. Dockwrath, but she was unable\nto do so without seeming to make a mystery with her son. When she\ncame to explain how the rumour had arisen and why she had thought it\nnecessary to tell him this, she was obliged to say that it had all\narisen from the wrath of the attorney. \"He has been to Groby Park,\"\nshe said, \"and now that he has returned he is spreading this report.\"\n\n\"I shall go to him to-morrow,\" said Lucius, very sternly.\n\n\"No, no; you must not do that. You must promise me that you will not\ndo that.\"\n\n\"But I shall. You cannot suppose that I shall allow such a man as\nthat to tamper with my name without noticing it! It is my business\nnow.\"\n\n\"No, Lucius. The attack will be against me rather than you;--that is,\nif an attack be made. I have told you because I do not like to have a\nsecret from you.\"\n\n\"Of course you have told me. If you are attacked who should defend\nyou, if I do not?\"\n\n\"The best defence, indeed the only defence till they take some active\nstep, will be silence. Most probably they will not do anything,\nand then we can afford to live down such reports as these. You can\nunderstand, Lucius, that the matter is grievous enough to me; and I\nam sure that for my sake you will not make it worse by a personal\nquarrel with such a man as that.\"\n\n\"I shall go to Mr. Furnival,\" said he, \"and ask his advice.\"\n\n\"I have done that already, Lucius. I thought it best to do so, when\nfirst I heard that Mr. Dockwrath was moving in the matter. It was for\nthat that I went up to town.\"\n\n\"And why did you not tell me?\"\n\n\"I then thought that you might be spared the pain of knowing anything\nof the matter. I tell you now because I hear to-day in Hamworth that\npeople are talking on the subject. You might be annoyed, as I was\njust now, if the first tidings had reached you from some stranger.\"\n\nHe sat silent for a while, turning his pencil in his hand, and\nlooking as though he were going to settle the matter off hand by his\nown thoughts. \"I tell you what it is, mother; I shall not let the\nburden of this fall on your shoulders. You carried on the battle\nbefore, but I must do so now. If I can trace any word of scandal to\nthat fellow Dockwrath, I shall indict him for a libel.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucius!\"\n\n\"I shall, and no mistake!\"\n\nWhat would he have said had he known that his mother had absolutely\nproposed to Mr. Furnival to buy off Mr. Dockwrath's animosity, almost\nat any price?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nMR. DOCKWRATH IN BEDFORD ROW.\n\n\nMr. Dockwrath, as he left Leeds and proceeded to join the bosom of\nhis family, was not discontented with what he had done. It might not\nimprobably have been the case that Mr. Mason would altogether refuse\nto see him, and having seen him, Mr. Mason might altogether have\ndeclined his assistance. He might have been forced as a witness to\ndisclose his secret, of which he could make so much better a profit\nas a legal adviser. As it was, Mr. Mason had promised to pay him for\nhis services, and would no doubt be induced to go so far as to give\nhim a legal claim for payment. Mr. Mason had promised to come up to\ntown, and had instructed the Hamworth attorney to meet him there; and\nunder such circumstances the Hamworth attorney had but little doubt\nthat time would produce a considerable bill of costs in his favour.\n\nAnd then he thought that he saw his way to a great success. I should\nbe painting the Devil too black were I to say that revenge was\nhis chief incentive in that which he was doing. All our motives\nare mixed; and his wicked desire to do evil to Lady Mason in\nreturn for the evil which she had done to him was mingled with\nprofessional energy, and an ambition to win a cause that ought to\nbe won--especially a cause which others had failed to win. He said\nto himself, on finding those names and dates among old Mr. Usbech's\npapers, that there was still an opportunity of doing something\nconsiderable in this Orley Farm Case, and he had made up his mind to\ndo it. Professional energy, revenge, and money considerations would\nwork hand in hand in this matter; and therefore, as he left Leeds in\nthe second-class railway carriage for London, he thought over the\nresult of his visit with considerable satisfaction.\n\nHe had left Leeds at ten, and Mr. Moulder had come down in the same\nomnibus to the station, and was travelling in the same train in\na first-class carriage. Mr. Moulder was a man who despised the\nsecond-class, and was not slow to say so before other commercials who\ntravelled at a cheaper rate than he did. \"Hubbles and Grease,\" he\nsaid, \"allowed him respectably, in order that he might go about their\nbusiness respectable; and he wasn't going to give the firm a bad name\nby being seen in a second-class carriage, although the difference\nwould go into his own pocket. That wasn't the way he had begun, and\nthat wasn't the way he was going to end.\" He said nothing to Mr.\nDockwrath in the morning, merely bowing in answer to that gentleman's\nsalutation. \"Hope you were comfortable last night in the back\ndrawing-room,\" said Mr. Dockwrath; but Mr. Moulder in reply only\nlooked at him.\n\nAt the Mansfield station, Mr. Kantwise, with his huge wooden boxes,\nappeared on the platform, and he got into the same carriage with Mr.\nDockwrath. He had come on by a night train, and had been doing a\nstroke of business that morning. \"Well, Kantwise,\" Moulder holloaed\nout from his warm, well-padded seat, \"doing it cheap and nasty, eh?\"\n\n\"Not at all nasty, Mr. Moulder,\" said the other. \"And I find myself\namong as respectable a class of society in the second-class as you do\nin the first; quite so;--and perhaps a little better,\" Mr. Kantwise\nadded, as he took his seat immediately opposite to Mr. Dockwrath. \"I\nhope I have the pleasure of seeing you pretty bobbish this morning,\nsir.\" And he shook hands cordially with the attorney.\n\n\"Tidy, thank you,\" said Dockwrath. \"My company last night did not do\nme any harm; you may swear to that.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! ha! I was so delighted that you got the better of Moulder; a\ndomineering party, isn't he? quite terrible! For myself, I can't put\nup with him sometimes.\"\n\n\"I didn't have to put up with him last night.\"\n\n\"No, no; it was very good, wasn't it now? very capital, indeed. All\nthe same I wish you'd heard Busby give us 'Beautiful Venice, City\nof Song!' A charming voice has Busby; quite charming.\" And there\nwas a pause for a minute or so, after which Mr. Kantwise resumed\nthe conversation. \"You'll allow me to put you up one of those\ndrawing-room sets?\" he said.\n\n\"Well, I am afraid not. I don't think they are strong enough where\nthere are children.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear; dear, dear; to hear you say so, Mr. Dockwrath! Why, they\nare made for strength. They are the very things for children, because\nthey don't break, you know.\"\n\n\"But they'd bend terribly.\"\n\n\"By no means. They're so elastic that they always recovers\nthemselves. I didn't show you that; but you might turn the backs of\nthem chairs nearly down to the ground, and they will come straight\nagain. You let me send you a set for your wife to look at. If she's\nnot charmed with them I'll--I'll--I'll eat them.\"\n\n\"Women are charmed with anything,\" said Mr. Dockwrath. \"A new bonnet\ndoes that.\"\n\n\"They know what they are about pretty well, as I dare say you have\nfound out. I'll send express to Sheffield and have a completely new\nset put up for you.\"\n\n\"For twelve seventeen six, of course?\"\n\n\"Oh! dear no, Mr. Dockwrath. The lowest figure for ready money,\ndelivered free, is fifteen ten.\"\n\n\"I couldn't think of paying more than Mrs. Mason.\"\n\n\"Ah! but that was a damaged set; it was, indeed. And she merely\nwanted it as a present for the curate's wife. The table was quite\nsprung, and the music-stool wouldn't twist.\"\n\n\"But you'll send them to me new?\"\n\n\"New from the manufactory; upon my word we will.\"\n\n\"A table that you have never acted upon--have never shown off on;\nstanding in the middle, you know?\"\n\n\"Yes; upon my honour. You shall have them direct from the workshop,\nand sent at once; you shall find them in your drawing-room on Tuesday\nnext.\"\n\n\"We'll say thirteen ten.\"\n\n\"I couldn't do it, Mr. Dockwrath--\" And so they went on, bargaining\nhalf the way up to town, till at last they came to terms for fourteen\neleven. \"And a very superior article your lady will find them,\" Mr.\nKantwise said as he shook hands with his new friend at parting.\n\nOne day Mr. Dockwrath remained at home in the bosom of his family,\nsaying all manner of spiteful things against Lady Mason, and on the\nnext day he went up to town and called on Round and Crook. That one\nday he waited in order that Mr. Mason might have time to write; but\nMr. Mason had written on the very day of the visit to Groby Park,\nand Mr. Round junior was quite ready for Mr. Dockwrath when that\ngentleman called.\n\nMr. Dockwrath when at home had again cautioned his wife to have no\nintercourse whatever \"with that swindler at Orley Farm,\" wishing\nthereby the more thoroughly to imbue poor Miriam with a conviction\nthat Lady Mason had committed some fraud with reference to the will.\n\"You had better say nothing about the matter anywhere; d'you hear?\nPeople will talk; all the world will be talking about it before long.\nBut that is nothing to you. If people ask you, say that you believe\nthat I am engaged in the case professionally, but that you know\nnothing further.\" As to all which Miriam of course promised the most\nexact obedience. But Mr. Dockwrath, though he only remained one day\nin Hamworth before he went to London, took care that the curiosity of\nhis neighbours should be sufficiently excited.\n\nMr. Dockwrath felt some little trepidation at the heart as he walked\ninto the office of Messrs. Round and Crook in Bedford Row. Messrs.\nRound and Crook stood high in the profession, and were men who in\nthe ordinary way of business would have had no personal dealings\nwith such a man as Mr. Dockwrath. Had any such intercourse become\nnecessary on commonplace subjects Messrs. Round and Crook's\nconfidential clerk might have seen Mr. Dockwrath, but even he would\nhave looked down upon the Hamworth attorney as from a great moral\nheight. But now, in the matter of the Orley Farm Case, Mr. Dockwrath\nhad determined that he would transact business only on equal terms\nwith the Bedford Row people. The secret was his--of his finding;\nhe knew the strength of his own position, and he would use it. But\nnevertheless he did tremble inwardly as he asked whether Mr. Round\nwas within;--or if not Mr. Round, then Mr. Crook.\n\nThere were at present three members in the firm, though the old name\nremained unaltered. The Mr. Round and the Mr. Crook of former days\nwere still working partners;--the very Round and the very Crook who\nhad carried on the battle on the part of Mr. Mason of Groby twenty\nyears ago; but to them had been added another Mr. Round, a son of\nold Round, who, though his name did not absolutely appear in the\nnomenclature of the firm, was, as a working man, the most important\nperson in it. Old Mr. Round might now be said to be ornamental and\ncommunicative. He was a hale man of nearly seventy, who thought a\ngreat deal of his peaches up at Isleworth, who came to the office\nfive times a week--not doing very much hard work, and who took the\nlargest share in the profits. Mr. Round senior had enjoyed the\nreputation of being a sound, honourable man, but was now considered\nby some to be not quite sharp enough for the practice of the present\nday.\n\nMr. Crook had usually done the dirty work of the firm, having been\noriginally a managing clerk; and he still did the same--in a small\nway. He had been the man to exact penalties, look after costs, and\nattend to any criminal business, or business partly criminal in its\nnature, which might chance find its way to them. But latterly in all\ngreat matters Mr. Round junior, Mr. Matthew Round,--his father was\nRichard,--was the member of the firm on whom the world in general\nplaced the greatest dependence. Mr. Mason's letter had in the\nordinary way of business come to him, although it had been addressed\nto his father, and he had resolved on acting on it himself.\n\nWhen Mr. Dockwrath called Mr. Round senior was at Birmingham, Mr.\nCrook was taking his annual holiday, and Mr. Round junior was\nreigning alone in Bedford Row. Instructions had been given to the\nclerks that if Mr. Dockwrath called he was to be shown in, and\ntherefore he found himself seated, with much less trouble than he had\nexpected, in the private room of Mr. Round junior. He had expected\nto see an old man, and was therefore somewhat confused, not feeling\nquite sure that he was in company with one of the principals; but\nnevertheless, looking at the room, and especially at the arm-chair\nand carpet, he was aware that the legal gentleman who motioned him to\na seat could be no ordinary clerk.\n\nThe manner of this legal gentleman was not, as Mr. Dockwrath thought,\nquite so ceremoniously civil as it might be, considering the\nimportant nature of the business to be transacted between them.\nMr. Dockwrath intended to treat on equal terms, and so intending\nwould have been glad to have shaken hands with his new ally at the\ncommencement of their joint operations. But the man before him,--a\nman younger than himself too,--did not even rise from his chair. \"Ah!\nMr. Dockwrath,\" he said, taking up a letter from the table, \"will you\nhave the goodness to sit down?\" And Mr. Matthew Round wheeled his\nown arm-chair towards the fire, stretching out his legs comfortably,\nand pointing to a somewhat distant seat as that intended for the\naccommodation of his visitor. Mr. Dockwrath seated himself in the\nsomewhat distant seat, and deposited his hat upon the floor, not\nbeing as yet quite at home in his position; but he made up his mind\nas he did so that he would be at home before he left the room.\n\n\"I find that you have been down in Yorkshire with a client of ours,\nMr. Dockwrath,\" said Mr. Matthew Round.\n\n\"Yes, I have,\" said he of Hamworth.\n\n\"Ah! well--; you are in the profession yourself, I believe?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am an attorney.\"\n\n\"Would it not have been well to have come to us first?\"\n\n\"No, I think not. I have not the pleasure of knowing your name, sir.\"\n\n\"My name is Round--Matthew Round.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, sir; I did not know,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, bowing.\nIt was a satisfaction to him to learn that he was closeted with a Mr.\nRound, even if it were not the Mr. Round. \"No, Mr. Round, I can't say\nthat I should have thought of that. In the first place I didn't know\nwhether Mr. Mason employed any lawyer, and in the next--\"\n\n\"Well, well; it does not matter. It is usual among the profession;\nbut it does not in the least signify. Mr. Mason has written to us,\nand he says that you have found out something about that Orley Farm\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Yes; I have found out something. At least, I rather think so.\"\n\n\"Well, what is, it, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"Ah! that's the question. It's rather a ticklish business, Mr. Round;\na family affair, as I may say.\"\n\n\"Whose family?\"\n\n\"To a certain extent my family, and to a certain extent Mr. Mason's\nfamily. I don't know how far I should be justified in laying all the\nfacts before you--wonderful facts they are too--in an off-hand way\nlike that. These matters have to be considered a great deal. It is\nnot only the extent of the property. There is much more than that in\nit, Mr. Round.\"\n\n\"If you don't tell me what there is in it, I don't see what we are to\ndo. I am sure you did not give yourself the trouble of coming up here\nfrom Hamworth merely with the object of telling us that you are going\nto hold your tongue.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Mr. Round.\"\n\n\"Then what did you come to say?\"\n\n\"May I ask you, Mr. Round, what Mr. Mason has told you with reference\nto my interview with him?\"\n\n\"Yes; I will read you a part of his letter--'Mr. Dockwrath is\nof opinion that the will under which the estate is now enjoyed\nis absolutely a forgery.' I presume you mean the codicil, Mr.\nDockwrath?\"\n\n\"Oh yes! the codicil of course.\"\n\n\"'And he has in his possession documents which I have not seen,\nbut which seem to me, as described, to go far to prove that this\ncertainly must have been the case.' And then he goes on with\na description of dates, although it is clear that he does not\nunderstand the matter himself--indeed he says as much. Now of course\nwe must see these documents before we can give our client any\nadvice.\" A certain small portion of Mr. Mason's letter Mr. Round did\nthen read, but he did not read those portions in which Mr. Mason\nexpressed his firm determination to reopen the case against Lady\nMason, and even to prosecute her for forgery if it were found that he\nhad anything like a fair chance of success in doing so. \"I know that\nyou were convinced,\" he had said, addressing himself personally to\nMr. Round senior, \"that Lady Mason was acting in good faith. I was\nalways convinced of the contrary, and am more sure of it now than\never.\" This last paragraph, Mr. Round junior had not thought it\nnecessary to read to Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"The documents to which I allude are in reference to my confidential\nfamily matters; and I certainly shall not produce them without\nknowing on what ground I am standing.\"\n\n\"Of course you are aware, Mr. Dockwrath, that we could compel you.\"\n\n\"There, Mr. Round, I must be allowed to differ.\"\n\n\"It won't come to that, of course. If you have anything worth\nshowing, you'll show it; and if we make use of you as a witness, it\nmust be as a willing witness.\"\n\n\"I don't think it probable that I shall be a witness in the matter at\nall.\"\n\n\"Ah, well; perhaps not. My own impression is that no case will be\nmade out; that there will be nothing to take before a jury.\"\n\n\"There again, I must differ from you, Mr. Round.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course! I suppose the real fact is, that it is a matter of\nmoney. You want to be paid for what information you have got. That is\nabout the long and the short of it; eh, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"I don't know what you call the long and the short of it, Mr. Round;\nor what may be your way of doing business. As a professional man, of\ncourse I expect to be paid for my work;--and I have no doubt that you\nexpect the same.\"\n\n\"No doubt, Mr. Dockwrath; but--as you have made the comparison,\nI hope you will excuse me for saying so--we always wait till our\nclients come to us.\"\n\nMr. Dockwrath drew himself up with some intention of becoming angry;\nbut he hardly knew how to carry it out; and then it might be a\nquestion whether anger would serve his turn. \"Do you mean to say, Mr.\nRound, if you had found documents such as these, you would have done\nnothing about them--that you would have passed them by as worthless?\"\n\n\"I can't say that till I know what the documents are. If I found\npapers concerning the client of another firm, I should go to that\nfirm if I thought that they demanded attention.\"\n\n\"I didn't know anything about the firm;--how was I to know?\"\n\n\"Well! you know now, Mr. Dockwrath. As I understand it, our client\nhas referred you to us. If you have anything to say, we are ready to\nhear it. If you have anything to show, we are ready to look at it. If\nyou have nothing to say, and nothing to show--\"\n\n\"Ah, but I have; only--\"\n\n\"Only you want us to make it worth your while. We might as well have\nthe truth at once. Is not that about it?\"\n\n\"I want to see my way, of course.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And now, Mr. Dockwrath, I must make you understand that we\ndon't do business in that way.\"\n\n\"Then I shall see Mr. Mason again myself.\"\n\n\"That you can do. He will be in town next week, and, as I believe,\nwishes to see you. As regards your expenses, if you can show us\nthat you have any communication to make that is worth our client's\nattention, we will see that you are paid what you are out of pocket,\nand some fair remuneration for the time you may have lost;--not as an\nattorney, remember, for in that light we cannot regard you.\"\n\n\"I am every bit as much an attorney as you are.\"\n\n\"No doubt; but you are not Mr. Mason's attorney; and as long as it\nsuits him to honour us with his custom, you cannot be so regarded.\"\n\n\"That's as he pleases.\"\n\n\"No; it is not, Mr. Dockwrath. It is as he pleases whether he employs\nyou or us; but it is not as he pleases whether he employs both on\nbusiness of the same class. He may give us his confidence, or he may\nwithdraw it.\"\n\n\"Looking at the way the matter was managed before, perhaps the latter\nmay be the better for him.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Dockwrath, for saying that that is a question I shall\nnot discuss with you.\"\n\nUpon this Mr. Dockwrath jumped from his chair, and took up his hat.\n\"Good morning to you, sir,\" said Mr. Round, without moving from his\nchair; \"I will tell Mr. Mason that you have declined making any\ncommunication to us. He will probably know your address--if he should\nwant it.\"\n\nMr. Dockwrath paused. Was he not about to sacrifice substantial\nadvantage to momentary anger? Would it not be better that he should\ncarry this impudent young London lawyer with him if it were possible?\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"I am quite willing to tell you all that I know of\nthis matter at present, if you will have the patience to hear it.\"\n\n\"Patience, Mr. Dockwrath! Why I am made of patience. Sit down again,\nMr. Dockwrath, and think of it.\"\n\nMr. Dockwrath did sit down again, and did think of it; and it ended\nin his telling to Mr. Round all that he had told to Mr. Mason. As he\ndid so, he looked closely at Mr. Round's face, but there he could\nread nothing. \"Exactly,\" said Mr. Round. \"The fourteenth of July is\nthe date of both. I have taken a memorandum of that. A final deed for\nclosing partnership, was it? I have got that down. John Kenneby and\nBridget Bolster. I remember the names,--witnesses to both deeds, were\nthey? I understand; nothing about this other deed was brought up at\nthe trial? I see the point--such as it is. John Kenneby and Bridget\nBolster;--both believed to be living. Oh, you can give their address,\ncan you? Decline to do so now? Very well; it does not matter. I think\nI understand it all now, Mr. Dockwrath; and when we want you again,\nyou shall hear from us. Samuel Dockwrath, is it? Thank you. Good\nmorning. If Mr. Mason wishes to see you, he will write, of course.\nGood day, Mr. Dockwrath.\"\n\nAnd so Mr. Dockwrath went home, not quite contented with his day's\nwork.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nVON BAUHR.\n\n\nIt will be remembered that Mr. Crabwitz was sent across from\nLincoln's Inn to Bedford Row to ascertain the present address of old\nMr. Round. \"Mr. Round is at Birmingham,\" he said, coming back. \"Every\none connected with the profession is at Birmingham, except--\"\n\n\"The more fools they,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"I am thinking of going down myself this evening,\" said Mr. Crabwitz.\n\"As you will be out of town, sir, I suppose I can be spared?\"\n\n\"You too!\"\n\n\"And why not me, Mr. Furnival? When all the profession is meeting\ntogether, why should not I be there as well as another? I hope you do\nnot deny me my right to feel an interest in the great subjects which\nare being discussed.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, Mr. Crabwitz. I do not deny you your right to be\nLord Chief Justice, if you can accomplish it. But you cannot be Lord\nChief Justice and my clerk at the same time. Nor can you be in my\nchambers if you are at Birmingham. I rather think I must trouble you\nto remain here, as I cannot tell at what moment I may be in town\nagain.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, I'm afraid--\" Mr. Crabwitz began his speech and then\nfaltered. He was going to tell Mr. Furnival that he must suit himself\nwith another clerk, when he remembered his fees, and paused. It would\nbe very pleasant to him to quit Mr. Furnival, but where could he get\nsuch another place? He knew that he himself was invaluable, but then\nhe was invaluable only to Mr. Furnival. Mr. Furnival would be mad to\npart with him, Mr. Crabwitz thought; but then would he not be almost\nmore mad to part with Mr. Furnival?\n\n\"Eh; well?\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"Oh! of course; if you desire it, Mr. Furnival, I will remain. But I\nmust say I think it is rather hard.\"\n\n\"Look here, Mr. Crabwitz; if you think my service is too hard upon\nyou, you had better leave it. But if you take upon yourself to\ntell me so again, you must leave it. Remember that.\" Mr. Furnival\npossessed the master mind of the two; and Mr. Crabwitz felt this as\nhe slunk back to his own room.\n\nSo Mr. Round also was at Birmingham, and could be seen there. This\nwas so far well; and Mr. Furnival, having again with ruthless malice\nsent Mr. Crabwitz for a cab, at once started for the Euston Square\nStation. He could master Mr. Crabwitz, and felt a certain pleasure\nin having done so; but could he master Mrs. F.? That lady had on one\nor two late occasions shown her anger at the existing state of her\ndomestic affairs, and had once previously gone so far as to make\nher lord understand that she was jealous of his proceedings with\nreference to other goddesses. But she had never before done this in\nthe presence of other people;--she had never allowed any special\ngoddess to see that she was the special object of such jealousy.\nNow she had not only committed herself in this way, but had also\ncommitted him, making him feel himself to be ridiculous; and it was\nhighly necessary that some steps should be taken;--if he only knew\nwhat step! All which kept his mind active as he journeyed in the cab.\n\nAt the station he found three or four other lawyers, all bound for\nBirmingham. Indeed, during this fortnight the whole line had been\nalive with learned gentlemen going to and fro, discussing weighty\npoints as they rattled along the iron road, and shaking their\nponderous heads at the new ideas which were being ventilated.\nMr. Furnival, with many others--indeed, with most of those who\nwere so far advanced in the world as to be making bread by their\nprofession--was of opinion that all this palaver that was going on in\nthe various tongues of Babel would end as it began--in words. \"Vox et\npr\u00c3\u00a6terea nihil.\" To practical Englishmen most of these international\ncongresses seem to arrive at nothing else. Men will not be talked out\nof the convictions of their lives. No living orator would convince a\ngrocer that coffee should be sold without chicory; and no amount of\neloquence will make an English lawyer think that loyalty to truth\nshould come before loyalty to his client. And therefore our own\npundits, though on this occasion they went to Birmingham, summoned by\nthe greatness of the occasion, by the dignity of foreign names, by\ninterest in the question, and by the influence of such men as Lord\nBoanerges, went there without any doubt on their minds as to the\nrectitude of their own practice, and fortified with strong resolves\nto resist all idea of change.\n\nAnd indeed one cannot understand how the bent of any man's mind\nshould be altered by the sayings and doings of such a congress.\n\n\"Well, Johnson, what have you all been doing to-day?\" asked Mr.\nFurnival of a special friend whom he chanced to meet at the club\nwhich had been extemporized at Birmingham.\n\n\"We have had a paper read by Von Bauhr. It lasted three hours.\"\n\n\"Three hours! heavens! Von Bauhr is, I think, from Berlin.\"\n\n\"Yes; he and Dr. Slotacher. Slotacher is to read his paper the day\nafter to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Then I think I shall go to London again. But what did Von Bauhr say\nto you during those three hours?\"\n\n\"Of course it was all in German, and I don't suppose that any one\nunderstood him,--unless it was Boanerges. But I believe it was the\nold story, going to show that the same man might be judge, advocate,\nand jury.\"\n\n\"No doubt;--if men were machines, and if you could find such machines\nperfect at all points in their machinery.\"\n\n\"And if the machines had no hearts?\"\n\n\"Machines don't have hearts,\" said Mr. Furnival; \"especially those in\nGermany. And what did Boanerges say? His answer did not take three\nhours more, I hope.\"\n\n\"About twenty minutes; but what he did say was lost on Von Bauhr, who\nunderstands as much English as I do German. He said that the practice\nof the Prussian courts had always been to him a subject of intense\ninterest, and that the general justice of their verdicts could not be\nimpugned.\"\n\n\"Nor ought it, seeing that a single trial for murder will occupy a\ncourt for three weeks. He should have asked Von Bauhr how much work\nhe usually got through in the course of a sessions. I don't seem\nto have lost much by being away. By-the-by, do you happen to know\nwhether Round is here?\"\n\n\"What, old Round? I saw him in the hall to-day yawning as though\nhe would burst.\" And then Mr. Furnival strolled off to look for\nthe attorney among the various purlieus frequented by the learned\nstrangers.\n\n\"Furnival,\" said another barrister, accosting him,--an elderly man,\nsmall, with sharp eyes and bushy eyebrows, dirty in his attire and\npoor in his general appearance, \"have you seen Judge Staveley?\" This\nwas Mr. Chaffanbrass, great at the Old Bailey, a man well able to\nhold his own in spite of the meanness of his appearance. At such a\nmeeting as this the English bar generally could have had no better\nrepresentative than Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n\"No; is he here?\"\n\n\"He must be here. He is the only man they could find who knows enough\nItalian to understand what that fat fellow from Florence will say\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"We're to have the Italian to-morrow, are we?\"\n\n\"Yes; and Staveley afterwards. It's as good as a play; only, like\nall plays, it's three times too long. I wonder whether anybody here\nbelieves in it?\"\n\n\"Yes, Felix Graham does.\"\n\n\"He believes everything--unless it is the Bible. He is one of\nthose young men who look for an instant millennium, and who regard\nthemselves not only as the prophets who foretell it, but as the\npreachers who will produce it. For myself, I am too old for a new\ngospel, with Felix Graham as an apostle.\"\n\n\"They say that Boanerges thinks a great deal of him.\"\n\n\"That can't be true, for Boanerges never thought much of any one but\nhimself. Well, I'm off to bed, for I find a day here ten times more\nfatiguing than the Old Bailey in July.\"\n\nOn the whole the meeting was rather dull, as such meetings usually\nare. It must not be supposed that any lawyer could get up at will, as\nthe spirit moved him, and utter his own ideas; or that all members of\nthe congress could speak if only they could catch the speaker's eye.\nHad this been so, a man might have been supported by the hope of\nhaving some finger in the pie, sooner or later. But in such case the\ncongress would have lasted for ever. As it was, the names of those\nwho were invited to address the meeting were arranged, and of course\nmen from each country were selected who were best known in their own\nspecial walks of their profession. But then these best-known men\ntook an unfair advantage of their position, and were ruthless in the\nlengthy cruelty of their addresses. Von Bauhr at Berlin was no doubt\na great lawyer, but he should not have felt so confident that the\nlegal proceedings of England and of the civilised world in general\ncould be reformed by his reading that book of his from the rostrum\nin the hall at Birmingham! The civilised world in general, as there\nrepresented, had been disgusted, and it was surmised that poor Dr.\nSlotacher would find but a meagre audience when his turn came.\n\nAt last Mr. Furnival succeeded in hunting up Mr. Round, and found him\nrecruiting outraged nature with a glass of brandy and water and a\ncigar. \"Looking for me, have you? Well, here I am; that is to say,\nwhat is left of me. Were you in the hall to-day?\"\n\n\"No; I was up in town.\"\n\n\"Ah! that accounts for your being so fresh. I wish I had been there.\nDo you ever do anything in this way?\" and Mr. Round touched the\noutside of his glass of toddy with his spoon. Mr. Furnival said that\nhe never did do anything in that way, which was true. Port wine was\nhis way, and it may be doubted whether on the whole it is not the\nmore dangerous way of the two. But Mr. Furnival, though he would\nnot drink brandy and water or smoke cigars, sat down opposite to Mr.\nRound, and had soon broached the subject which was on his mind.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the attorney, \"it is quite true that I had a letter on\nthe subject from Mr. Mason. The lady is not wrong in supposing that\nsome one is moving in the matter.\"\n\n\"And your client wishes you to take up the case again?\"\n\n\"No doubt he does. He was not a man that I ever greatly liked, Mr.\nFurnival, though I believe he means well. He thinks that he has been\nill used; and perhaps he was ill used--by his father.\"\n\n\"But that can be no possible reason for badgering the life out of his\nfather's widow twenty years after his father's death!\"\n\n\"Of course he thinks that he has some new evidence. I can't say I\nlooked into the matter much myself. I did read the letter; but that\nwas all, and then I handed it to my son. As far as I remember, Mr.\nMason said that some attorney at Hamworth had been to him.\"\n\n\"Exactly; a low fellow whom you would be ashamed to see in your\noffice! He fancies that young Mason has injured him; and though he\nhas received numberless benefits from Lady Mason, this is the way in\nwhich he chooses to be revenged on her son.\"\n\n\"We should have nothing to do with such a matter as that, you know.\nIt's not our line.\"\n\n\"No, of course it is not; I am well aware of that. And I am equally\nwell aware that nothing Mr. Mason can do can shake Lady Mason's\ntitle, or rather her son's title, to the property. But, Mr. Round, if\nhe be encouraged to gratify his malice--\"\n\n\"If who be encouraged?\"\n\n\"Your client, Mr. Mason of Groby;--there can be no doubt that he\nmight harass this unfortunate lady till he brought her nearly to the\ngrave.\"\n\n\"That would be a pity, for I believe she's still an uncommon pretty\nwoman.\" And the attorney indulged in a little fat inward chuckle;\nfor in these days Mr. Furnival's taste with reference to strange\ngoddesses was beginning to be understood by the profession.\n\n\"She is a very old friend of mine,\" said Mr. Furnival, gravely, \"a\nvery old friend indeed; and if I were to desert her now, she would\nhave no one to whom she could look.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes; I'm sure you're very kind;\" and Mr. Round altered his\nface and tone, so that they might be in conformity with those of his\ncompanion. \"Anything I can do, of course I shall be very happy. I\nshould be slow, myself, to advise my client to try the matter again,\nbut to tell the truth anything of this kind would go to my son now. I\ndid read Mr. Mason's letter, but I immediately handed it to Matthew.\"\n\n\"I will tell you how you can oblige me, Mr. Round.\"\n\n\"Do tell me; I am sure I shall be very happy.\"\n\n\"Look into this matter yourself, and talk it over with Mr. Mason\nbefore you allow anything to be done. It is not that I doubt your\nson's discretion. Indeed we all know what an exceedingly good man of\nbusiness he is.\"\n\n\"Matthew is sharp enough,\" said the prosperous father.\n\n\"But then young men are apt to be too sharp. I don't know whether you\nremember the case about that Orley Farm, Mr. Round.\"\n\n\"As well as if it were yesterday,\" said the attorney.\n\n\"Then you must recollect how thoroughly you were convinced that your\nclient had not a leg to stand upon.\"\n\n\"It was I that insisted that he should not carry it before the\nChancellor. Crook had the general management of those cases then, and\nwould have gone on; but I said, no. I would not see my client's money\nwasted in such a wild-goose chase. In the first place the property\nwas not worth it; and in the next place there was nothing to impugn\nthe will. If I remember right it all turned on whether an old man who\nhad signed as witness was well enough to write his name.\"\n\n\"That was the point.\"\n\n\"And I think it was shown that he had himself signed a receipt on\nthat very day--or the day after, or the day before. It was something\nof that kind.\"\n\n\"Exactly; those were the facts. As regards the result of a new trial,\nno sane man, I fancy, could have any doubt. You know as well as any\none living how great is the strength of twenty years of possession--\"\n\n\"It would be very strong on her side, certainly.\"\n\n\"He would not have a chance; of course not. But, Mr. Round, he might\nmake that poor woman so wretched that death would be a relief to her.\nNow it may be possible that something looking like fresh evidence\nmay have been discovered; something of this kind probably has been\nfound, or this man would not be moving; he would not have gone to the\nexpense of a journey to Yorkshire had he not got hold of some new\nstory.\"\n\n\"He has something in his head; you may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"Don't let your son be run away with by this, or advise your client\nto incur the terrible expense of a new trial, without knowing what\nyou are about. I tell you fairly that I do dread such a trial on this\npoor lady's account. Reflect what it would be, Mr. Round, to any lady\nof your own family.\"\n\n\"I don't think Mrs. Round would mind it much; that is, if she were\nsure of her case.\"\n\n\"She is a strong-minded woman; but poor Lady Mason--.\"\n\n\"She was strong-minded enough too, if I remember right, at the last\ntrial. I shall never forget how composed she was when old Bennett\ntried to shake her evidence. Do you remember how bothered he was?\"\n\n\"He was an excellent lawyer,--was Bennett. There are few better men\nat the bar now-a-days.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't have found him down here, Mr. Furnival, listening to a\nGerman lecture three hours long. I don't know how it is, but I think\nwe all used to work harder in those days than the young men do now.\"\nAnd then these eulogists of past days went back to the memories of\ntheir youths, declaring how in the old glorious years, now gone, no\ncongress such as this would have had a chance of success. Men had\nmen's work to do then, and were not wont to play the fool, first at\none provincial town and then at another, but stuck to their oars and\nmade their fortunes. \"It seems to me, Mr. Furnival,\" said Mr. Round,\n\"that this is all child's play, and to tell the truth I am half\nashamed of myself for being here.\"\n\n\"And you'll look into that matter yourself, Mr. Round?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will, certainly.\"\n\n\"I shall take it as a great favour. Of course you will advise your\nclient in accordance with any new facts which may be brought before\nyou; but as I feel certain that no case against young Mason can have\nany merits, I do hope that you will be able to suggest to Mr. Mason\nof Groby that the matter should be allowed to rest.\" And then Mr.\nFurnival took his leave, still thinking how far it might be possible\nthat the enemy's side of the question might be supported by real\nmerits. Mr. Round was a good-natured old fellow, and if the case\ncould be inveigled out of his son's hands and into his own, it might\nbe possible that even real merits should avail nothing.\n\n\"I confess I am getting rather tired of it,\" said Felix Graham that\nevening to his friend young Staveley, as he stood outside his bedroom\ndoor at the top of a narrow flight of stairs in the back part of a\nlarge hotel at Birmingham.\n\n\"Tired of it! I should think you are too.\"\n\n\"But nevertheless I am as sure as ever that good will come from it.\nI am inclined to think that the same kind of thing must be endured\nbefore any improvement is made in anything.\"\n\n\"That all reformers have to undergo Von Bauhr?\"\n\n\"Yes, all of them that do any good. Von Bauhr's words were very dry,\nno doubt.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to say that you understood them?\"\n\n\"Not many of them. A few here and there, for the first half-hour,\ncame trembling home to my dull comprehension, and then--\"\n\n\"You went to sleep.\"\n\n\"The sounds became too difficult for my ears; but dry and dull and\nhard as they were, they will not absolutely fall to the ground. He\nhad a meaning in them, and that meaning will reproduce itself in some\nshape.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid that it should ever do so in my presence! All the\niniquities of which the English bar may be guilty cannot be so\nintolerable to humanity as Von Bauhr.\"\n\n\"Well, good-night, old fellow; your governor is to give us his ideas\nto-morrow, and perhaps he will be as bad to the Germans as your Von\nBauhr was to us.\"\n\n\"Then I can only say that my governor will be very cruel to the\nGermans.\" And so they two went to their dreams.\n\nIn the mean time Von Bauhr was sitting alone looking back on the past\nhours with ideas and views very different from those of the many\nEnglish lawyers who were at that time discussing his demerits. To him\nthe day had been one long triumph, for his voice had sounded sweet\nin his own ears as, period after period, he had poured forth in full\nflowing language the gathered wisdom and experience of his life.\nPublic men in England have so much to do that they cannot give time\nto the preparation of speeches for such meetings as these, but Von\nBauhr had been at work on his pamphlet for months. Nay, taking it in\nthe whole, had he not been at work on it for years? And now a kind\nProvidence had given him the opportunity of pouring it forth before\nthe assembled pundits gathered from all the nations of the civilised\nworld.\n\nAs he sat there, solitary in his bedroom, his hands dropped down by\nhis side, his pipe hung from his mouth on to his breast, and his\neyes, turned up to the ceiling, were lighted almost with inspiration.\nMen there at the congress, Mr. Chaffanbrass, young Staveley, Felix\nGraham, and others, had regarded him as an impersonation of dullness;\nbut through his mind and brain, as he sat there wrapped in his old\ndressing-gown, there ran thoughts which seemed to lift him lightly\nfrom the earth into an elysium of justice and mercy. And at the\nend of this elysium, which was not wild in its beauty, but trim\nand orderly in its gracefulness,--as might be a beer-garden at\nMunich,--there stood among flowers and vases a pedestal, grand above\nall other pedestals in that garden; and on this there was a bust with\nan inscription:--\"To Von Bauhr, who reformed the laws of nations.\"\n\nIt was a grand thought; and though there was in it much of human\nconceit, there was in it also much of human philanthropy. If a reign\nof justice could be restored through his efforts--through those\nefforts in which on this hallowed day he had been enabled to make\nso great a progress--how beautiful would it be! And then as he sat\nthere, while the smoke still curled from his unconscious nostrils, he\nfelt that he loved all Germans, all Englishmen, even all Frenchmen,\nin his very heart of hearts, and especially those who had travelled\nwearily to this English town that they might listen to the results\nof his wisdom. He said to himself, and said truly, that he loved\nthe world, and that he would willingly spend himself in these great\nendeavours for the amelioration of its laws and the perfection of its\njudicial proceedings. And then he betook himself to bed in a frame of\nmind that was not unenviable.\n\n[Illustration: Von Bauhr's Dream.]\n\nI am inclined, myself, to agree with Felix Graham that such efforts\nare seldom absolutely wasted. A man who strives honestly to do good\nwill generally do good, though seldom perhaps as much as he has\nhimself anticipated. Let Von Bauhr have his pedestal among the\nflowers, even though it be small and humble!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE ENGLISH VON BAUHR.\n\n\nOn the following morning, before breakfast, Felix Graham and Augustus\nStaveley prepared themselves for the labours of the coming day by a\nwalk into the country; for even at Birmingham, by perseverance, a\nwalk into the country may be attained,--and very pretty country it\nis when reached. These congress meetings did not begin before eleven,\nso that for those who were active time for matutinal exercise was\nallowed.\n\nAugustus Staveley was the only son of the judge who on that day was\nto defend the laws of England from such attacks as might be made on\nthem by a very fat advocate from Florence. Of Judge Staveley himself\nmuch need not be said now, except that he lived at Noningsby near\nAlston, distant from The Cleeve about nine miles, and that at his\nhouse Sophia Furnival had been invited to pass the coming Christmas.\nHis son was a handsome clever fellow, who had nearly succeeded in\ngetting the Newdegate, and was now a member of the Middle Temple. He\nwas destined to follow the steps of his father, and become a light\nat the Common Law bar; but hitherto he had not made much essential\nprogress. The world had been too pleasant to him to allow of his\ngiving many of his hours to work. His father was one of the best men\nin the world, revered on the bench, and loved by all men; but he\nhad not sufficient parental sternness to admit of his driving his\nson well into harness. He himself had begun the world with little\nor nothing, and had therefore succeeded; but his son was already\npossessed of almost everything that he could want, and therefore his\nsuccess seemed doubtful. His chambers were luxuriously furnished, he\nhad his horse in Piccadilly, his father's house at Noningsby was\nalways open to him, and the society of London spread out for him all\nits allurements. Under such circumstances how could it be expected\nthat he should work? Nevertheless he did talk of working, and had\nsome idea in his head of the manner in which he would do so. To a\ncertain extent he had worked, and he could talk fluently of the\nlittle that he knew. The idea of a _far niente_ life would have been\nintolerable to him; but there were many among his friends who began\nto think that such a life would nevertheless be his ultimate destiny.\nNor did it much matter, they said, for the judge was known to have\nmade money.\n\nBut his friend Felix Graham was rowing in a very different boat; and\nof him also many prophesied that he would hardly be able to push his\ncraft up against the strength of the stream. Not that he was an idle\nman, but that he would not work at his oars in the only approved\nmethod of making progress for his boat. He also had been at Oxford;\nbut he had done little there except talk at a debating society, and\nmake himself notorious by certain ideas on religious subjects which\nwere not popular at the University. He had left without taking a\ndegree, in consequence, as it was believed, of some such notions,\nand had now been called to the bar with a fixed resolve to open the\noyster with such weapons, offensive and defensive, as nature had\ngiven to him. But here, as at Oxford, he would not labour on the\nsame terms with other men, or make himself subject to the same\nconventional rules; and therefore it seemed only too probable that he\nmight win no prize. He had ideas of his own that men should pursue\ntheir labours without special conventional regulations, but should be\nguided in their work by the general great rules of the world,--such\nfor instance as those given in the commandments:--Thou shalt not bear\nfalse witness; Thou shalt not steal; and others. His notions no doubt\nwere great, and perhaps were good; but hitherto they had not led him\nto much pecuniary success in his profession. A sort of a name he\nhad obtained, but it was not a name sweet in the ears of practising\nattorneys.\n\nAnd yet it behoved Felix Graham to make money, for none was coming\nto him ready made from any father. Father or mother he had none, nor\nuncles and aunts likely to be of service to him. He had begun the\nworld with some small sum, which had grown smaller and smaller, till\nnow there was left to him hardly enough to create an infinitesimal\ndividend. But he was not a man to become downhearted on that\naccount. A living of some kind he could pick up, and did now procure\nfor himself, from the press of the day. He wrote poetry for the\nperiodicals, and politics for the penny papers with considerable\nsuccess and sufficient pecuniary results. He would sooner do this, he\noften boasted, than abandon his great ideas or descend into the arena\nwith other weapons than those which he regarded as fitting for an\nhonest man's hand.\n\nAugustus Staveley, who could be very prudent for his friend, declared\nthat marriage would set him right. If Felix would marry he would\nquietly slip his neck into the collar and work along with the team,\nas useful a horse as ever was put at the wheel of a coach. But Felix\ndid not seem inclined to marry. He had notions about that also, and\nwas believed by one or two who knew him intimately to cherish an\ninsane affection for some unknown damsel, whose parentage, education,\nand future were not likely to assist his views in the outer world.\nSome said that he was educating this damsel for his wife,--moulding\nher, so that she might be made fit to suit his taste; but Augustus,\nthough he knew the secret of all this, was of opinion that it would\ncome right at last. \"He'll meet some girl in the world with a hatful\nof money, a pretty face, and a sharp tongue; then he'll bestow his\nmoulded bride on a neighbouring baker with two hundred pounds for her\nfortune;--and everybody will be happy.\"\n\nFelix Graham was by no means a handsome man. He was tall and thin,\nand his face had been slightly marked with the small-pox. He stooped\nin his gait as he walked, and was often awkward with his hands and\nlegs. But he was full of enthusiasm, indomitable, as far as pluck\nwould make him so, in contests of all kinds, and when he talked on\nsubjects which were near his heart there was a radiance about him\nwhich certainly might win the love of the pretty girl with the sharp\ntongue and the hatful of money. Staveley, who really loved him, had\nalready selected the prize, and she was no other than our friend,\nSophia Furnival. The sharp tongue and the pretty face and the hatful\nof money would all be there; but then Sophia Furnival was a girl who\nmight perhaps expect in return for these things more than an ugly\nface which could occasionally become radiant with enthusiasm.\n\nThe two men had got away from the thickness of the Birmingham smoke,\nand were seated on the top rung of a gate leading into a stubble\nfield. So far they had gone with mutual consent, but further than\nthis Staveley refused to go. He was seated with a cigar in his mouth.\nGraham also was smoking, but he was accommodated with a short pipe.\n\n[Illustration: The English Von Bauhr and his pupil.]\n\n\"A walk before breakfast is all very well,\" said Staveley, \"but I\nam not going on a pilgrimage. We are four miles from the inn this\nminute.\"\n\n\"And for your energies that is a good deal. Only think that you\nshould have been doing anything for two hours before you begin to\nfeed.\"\n\n\"I wonder why matutinal labour should always be considered as so\nmeritorious. Merely, I take it, because it is disagreeable.\"\n\n\"It proves that the man can make an effort.\"\n\n\"Every prig who wishes to have it believed that he does more than his\nneighbours either burns the midnight lamp or gets up at four in the\nmorning. Good wholesome work between breakfast and dinner never seems\nto count for anything.\"\n\n\"Have you ever tried?\"\n\n\"Yes; I am trying now, here at Birmingham.\"\n\n\"Not you.\"\n\n\"That's so like you, Graham. You don't believe that anybody is\nattending to what is going on except yourself. I mean to-day to take\nin the whole theory of Italian jurisprudence.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that you may do so with advantage. I do not suppose\nthat it is very good, but it must at any rate be better than our own.\nCome, let us go back to the town; my pipe is finished.\"\n\n\"Fill another, there's a good fellow. I can't afford to throw away my\ncigar, and I hate walking and smoking. You mean to assert that our\nwhole system is bad, and rotten, and unjust?\"\n\n\"I mean to say that I think so.\"\n\n\"And yet we consider ourselves the greatest people in the world,--or\nat any rate the honestest.\"\n\n\"I think we are; but laws and their management have nothing to do\nwith making people honest. Good laws won't make people honest, nor\nbad laws dishonest.\"\n\n\"But a people who are dishonest in one trade will probably be\ndishonest in others. Now, you go so far as to say that all English\nlawyers are rogues.\"\n\n\"I have never said so. I believe your father to be as honest a man as\never breathed.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" and Staveley lifted his hat.\n\n\"And I would fain hope that I am an honest man myself.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you don't make money by it.\"\n\n\"What I do mean is this, that from our love of precedent and ceremony\nand old usages, we have retained a system which contains many of\nthe barbarities of the feudal times, and also many of its lies. We\ntry our culprit as we did in the old days of the ordeal. If luck\nwill carry him through the hot ploughshares, we let him escape\nthough we know him to be guilty. We give him the advantage of every\ntechnicality, and teach him to lie in his own defence, if nature has\nnot sufficiently so taught him already.\"\n\n\"You mean as to his plea of not guilty.\"\n\n\"No, I don't; that is little or nothing. We ask him whether or no he\nconfesses his guilt in a foolish way, tending to induce him to deny\nit; but that is not much. Guilt seldom will confess as long as a\nchance remains. But we teach him to lie, or rather we lie for him\nduring the whole ceremony of his trial. We think it merciful to give\nhim chances of escape, and hunt him as we do a fox, in obedience to\ncertain laws framed for his protection.\"\n\n\"And should he have no protection?\"\n\n\"None certainly, as a guilty man; none which may tend towards the\nconcealing of his guilt. Till that be ascertained, proclaimed, and\nmade apparent, every man's hand should be against him.\"\n\n\"But if he is innocent?\"\n\n\"Therefore let him be tried with every possible care. I know you\nunderstand what I mean, though you look as though you did not. For\nthe protection of his innocence let astute and good men work their\nbest, but for the concealing of his guilt let no astute or good man\nwork at all.\"\n\n\"And you would leave the poor victim in the dock without defence?\"\n\n\"By no means. Let the poor victim, as you call him,--who in\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred is a rat who has been preying in\nour granaries,--let him, I say, have his defender,--the defender of\nhis possible innocence, not the protector of his probable guilt. It,\nall resolves itself into this. Let every lawyer go into court with\na mind resolved to make conspicuous to the light of day that which\nseems to him to be the truth. A lawyer who does not do that--who does\nthe reverse of that, has in my mind undertaken work which is unfit\nfor a gentleman and impossible for an honest man.\"\n\n\"What a pity it is that you should not have an opportunity of\nrivalling Von Bauhr at the congress!\"\n\n\"I have no doubt that Von Bauhr said a great deal of the same nature;\nand what Von Bauhr said will not wholly be wasted, though it may not\nyet have reached our sublime understandings.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he will vouchsafe to us a translation.\"\n\n\"It would be useless at present, seeing that we cannot bring\nourselves to believe it possible that a foreigner should in any\nrespect be wiser than ourselves. If any such point out to us our\nfollies, we at once claim those follies as the special evidences of\nour wisdom. We are so self-satisfied with our own customs, that we\nhold up our hands with surprise at the fatuity of men who presume\nto point out to us their defects. Those practices in which we most\nwidely depart from the broad and recognised morality of all civilised\nages and countries are to us the Palladiums of our jurisprudence.\nModes of proceeding which, if now first proposed to us, would be\nthought to come direct from the devil, have been made so sacred by\ntime that they have lost all the horror of their falseness in the\nholiness of their age. We cannot understand that other nations look\nupon such doings as we regard the human sacrifices of the Brahmins;\nbut the fact is that we drive a Juggernaut's car through every assize\ntown in the country, three times a year, and allow it to be dragged\nruthlessly through the streets of the metropolis at all times and\nseasons. Now come back to breakfast, for I won't wait here any\nlonger.\" Seeing that these were the ideas of Felix Graham, it is\nhardly a matter of wonder that such men as Mr. Furnival and Mr. Round\nshould have regarded his success at the bar as doubtful.\n\n\"Uncommon bad mutton chops these are,\" said Staveley, as they sat at\ntheir meal in the coffee-room of the Imperial Hotel.\n\n\"Are they?\" said Graham. \"They seem to me much the same as other\nmutton chops.\"\n\n\"They are uneatable. And look at this for coffee! Waiter, take this\naway, and have some made fresh.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the waiter, striving to escape without further\ncomment.\n\n\"And waiter--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir;\" and the poor overdriven functionary returned.\n\n\"Ask them from me whether they know how to make coffee. It does not\nconsist of an unlimited supply of lukewarm water poured over an\ninfinitesimal proportion of chicory. That process, time-honoured in\nthe hotel line, will not produce the beverage called coffee. Will you\nhave the goodness to explain that in the bar as coming from me?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the waiter; and then he was allowed to disappear.\n\n\"How can you give yourself so much trouble with no possible hope of\nan advantageous result?\" said Felix Graham.\n\n\"That's what you weak men always say. Perseverance in such a course\nwill produce results. It is because we put up with bad things that\nhotel-keepers continue to give them to us. Three or four Frenchmen\nwere dining with my father yesterday at the King's Head, and I had to\nsit at the bottom of the table. I declare to you that I literally\nblushed for my country; I did indeed. It was useless to say anything\nthen, but it was quite clear that there was nothing that one of them\ncould eat. At any hotel in France you'll get a good dinner; but we're\nso proud that we are ashamed to take lessons.\" And thus Augustus\nStaveley was quite as loud against his own country, and as laudatory\nwith regard to others, as Felix Graham had been before breakfast.\n\nAnd so the congress went on at Birmingham. The fat Italian from\nTuscany read his paper; but as he, though judge in his own country\nand reformer here in England, was somewhat given to comedy, this\nmorning was not so dull as that which had been devoted to Von Bauhr.\nAfter him Judge Staveley made a very elegant, and some said, a very\neloquent speech; and so that day was done. Many other days also wore\nthemselves away in this process; numerous addresses were read, and\nanswers made to them, and the newspapers for the time were full of\nlaw. The defence of our own system, which was supposed to be the most\nremarkable for its pertinacity, if not for its justice, came from Mr.\nFurnival, who roused himself to a divine wrath for the occasion. And\nthen the famous congress at Birmingham was brought to a close, and\nall the foreigners returned to their own countries.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE STAVELEY FAMILY.\n\n\nThe next two months passed by without any events which deserve our\nspecial notice, unless it be that Mr. Joseph Mason and Mr. Dockwrath\nhad a meeting in the room of Mr. Matthew Round, in Bedford Row. Mr.\nDockwrath struggled hard to effect this without the presence of the\nLondon attorney; but he struggled in vain. Mr. Round was not the man\nto allow any stranger to tamper with his client, and Mr. Dockwrath\nwas forced to lower his flag before him. The result was that the\ndocument or documents which had been discovered at Hamworth were\nbrought up to Bedford Row; and Dockwrath at last made up his mind\nthat as he could not supplant Matthew Round, he would consent to\nfight under him as his lieutenant--or even as his sergeant or\ncorporal, if no higher position might be allowed to him.\n\n\"There is something in it, certainly, Mr. Mason,\" said young Round;\n\"but I cannot undertake to say as yet that we are in a position to\nprove the point.\"\n\n\"It will be proved,\" said Mr. Dockwrath.\n\n\"I confess it seems to me very clear,\" said Mr. Mason, who by this\ntime had been made to understand the bearings of the question. \"It\nis evident that she chose that day for her date because those two\npersons had then been called upon to act as witnesses to that other\ndeed.\"\n\n\"That of course is our allegation. I only say that we may have some\ndifficulty in proving it.\"\n\n\"The crafty, thieving swindler!\" exclaimed Mr. Mason. \"She has been\nsharp enough if it is as we think,\" said Round, laughing; and then\nthere was nothing more done in the matter for some time, to the great\ndisgust both of Mr. Dockwrath and Mr. Mason. Old Mr. Round had kept\nhis promise to Mr. Furnival; or, at least, had done something towards\nkeeping it. He had not himself taken the matter into his own hands,\nbut he had begged his son to be cautious. \"It's not the sort of\nbusiness that we care for, Mat,\" said he; \"and as for that fellow\ndown in Yorkshire, I never liked him.\" To this Mat had answered that\nneither did he like Mr. Mason; but as the case had about it some very\nremarkable points, it was necessary to look into it; and then the\nmatter was allowed to stand over till after Christmas.\n\nWe will now change the scene to Noningsby, the judge's country\nseat, near Alston, at which a party was assembled for the Christmas\nholidays. The judge was there of course,--without his wig; in which\nguise I am inclined to think that judges spend the more comfortable\nhours of their existence; and there also was Lady Staveley, her\npresence at home being altogether a matter of course, inasmuch as she\nhad no other home than Noningsby. For many years past, ever since the\nhappy day on which Noningsby had been acquired, she had repudiated\nLondon; and the poor judge, when called upon by his duties to reside\nthere, was compelled to live like a bachelor, in lodgings. Lady\nStaveley was a good, motherly, warm-hearted woman, who thought a\ngreat deal about her flowers and fruit, believing that no one else\nhad them so excellent,--much also about her butter and eggs, which\nin other houses were, in her opinion, generally unfit to be eaten;\nshe thought also a great deal about her children, who were all\nswans,--though, as she often observed with a happy sigh, those of her\nneighbours were so uncommonly like geese. But she thought most of\nall of her husband, who in her eyes was the perfection of all manly\nvirtues. She had made up her mind that the position of a puisne judge\nin England was the highest which could fall to the lot of any mere\nmortal. To become a Lord Chancellor, or a Lord Chief Justice, or\na Chief Baron, a man must dabble with Parliament, politics, and\ndirt; but the bench-fellows of these politicians were selected for\ntheir wisdom, high conduct, knowledge, and discretion. Of all such\nselections, that made by the late king when he chose her husband, was\nthe one which had done most honour to England, and had been in all\nits results most beneficial to Englishmen. Such was her creed with\nreference to domestic matters.\n\nThe Staveley young people at present were only two in number,\nAugustus, namely, and his sister Madeline. The eldest daughter was\nmarried, and therefore, though she spent these Christmas holidays at\nNoningsby, must not be regarded as one of the Noningsby family. Of\nAugustus we have said enough; but as I intend that Madeline Staveley\nshall, to many of my readers, be the most interesting personage\nin this story, I must pause to say something of her. I must say\nsomething of her; and as, with all women, the outward and visible\nsigns of grace and beauty are those which are thought of the most, or\nat any rate spoken of the oftenest, I will begin with her exterior\nattributes. And that the muses may assist me in my endeavour,\nteaching my rough hands to draw with some accuracy the delicate lines\nof female beauty, I now make to them my humble but earnest prayer.\n\nMadeline Staveley was at this time about nineteen years of age. That\nshe was perfect in her beauty I cannot ask the muses to say, but that\nshe will some day become so, I think the goddesses may be requested\nto prophesy. At present she was very slight, and appeared to be\nalmost too tall for her form. She was indeed above the average height\nof women, and from her brother encountered some ridicule on this\nhead; but not the less were all her movements soft, graceful, and\nfawnlike as should be those of a young girl. She was still at this\ntime a child in heart and spirit, and could have played as a child\nhad not the instinct of a woman taught to her the expediency of a\nstaid demeanour. There is nothing among the wonders of womanhood more\nwonderful than this, that the young mind and young heart,--hearts and\nminds young as youth can make them, and in their natures as gay,--can\nassume the gravity and discretion of threescore years and maintain\nit successfully before all comers. And this is done, not as a lesson\nthat has been taught, but as the result of an instinct implanted from\nthe birth. Let us remember the mirth of our sisters in our homes, and\ntheir altered demeanours when those homes were opened to strangers;\nand remember also that this change had come from the inward working\nof their own feminine natures!\n\nBut I am altogether departing from Madeline Staveley's external\ngraces. It was a pity almost that she should ever have become grave,\nbecause with her it was her smile that was so lovely. She smiled with\nher whole face. There was at such moments a peculiar laughing light\nin her gray eyes, which inspired one with an earnest desire to be in\nher confidence; she smiled with her soft cheek, the light tints of\nwhich would become a shade more pink from the excitement, as they\nsoftly rippled into dimples; she smiled with her forehead which would\ncatch the light from her eyes and arch itself in its glory; but above\nall she smiled with her mouth, just showing, but hardly showing, the\nbeauty of the pearls within. I never saw the face of a woman whose\nmouth was equal in pure beauty, in beauty that was expressive of\nfeeling, to that of Madeline Staveley. Many have I seen with a richer\nlip, with a more luxurious curve, much more tempting as baits to the\nvillainy and rudeness of man; but never one that told so much by\nits own mute eloquence of a woman's happy heart and a woman's happy\nbeauty. It was lovely as I have said in its mirth, but if possible it\nwas still more lovely in its woe; for then the lips would separate,\nand the breath would come, and in the emotion of her suffering the\nlife of her beauty would be unrestrained.\n\nHer face was oval, and some might say that it was almost too thin;\nthey might say so till they knew it well, but would never say so when\nthey did so know it. Her complexion was not clear, though it would be\nwrong to call her a brunette. Her face and forehead were never brown,\nbut yet she could not boast the pure pink and the pearly white which\ngo to the formation of a clear complexion. For myself I am not sure\nthat I love a clear complexion. Pink and white alone will not give\nthat hue which seems best to denote light and life, and to tell of\na mind that thinks and of a heart that feels. I can name no colour\nin describing the soft changing tints of Madeline Staveley's face,\nbut I will make bold to say that no man ever found it insipid or\ninexpressive.\n\nAnd now what remains for me to tell? Her nose was Grecian, but\nperhaps a little too wide at the nostril to be considered perfect\nin its chiselling. Her hair was soft and brown,--that dark brown\nwhich by some lights is almost black; but she was not a girl whose\nloveliness depended much upon her hair. With some women it is their\ngreat charm,--Ne\u00c3\u00a6ras who love to sit half sleeping in the shade,--but\nit is a charm that possesses no powerful eloquence. All beauty of a\nhigh order should speak, and Madeline's beauty was ever speaking. And\nnow that I have said that, I believe that I have told all that may\nbe necessary to place her outward form before the inward eyes of my\nreaders.\n\nIn commencing this description I said that I would begin with her\nexterior; but it seems to me now that in speaking of these I have\nsufficiently noted also that which was within. Of her actual thoughts\nand deeds up to this period it is not necessary for our purposes that\nanything should be told; but of that which she might probably think\nor might possibly do, a fair guess may, I hope, be made from that\nwhich has been already written.\n\nSuch was the Staveley family. Those of their guests whom it is\nnecessary that I should now name, have been already introduced to us.\nMiss Furnival was there, as was also her father. He had not intended\nto make any prolonged stay at Noningsby,--at least so he had said in\nhis own drawing-room; but nevertheless he had now been there for a\nweek, and it seemed probable that he might stay over Christmas-day.\nAnd Felix Graham was there. He had been asked with a special purpose\nby his friend Augustus, as we already have heard; in order, namely,\nthat he might fall in love with Sophia Furnival, and by the aid of\nher supposed hatful of money avoid the evils which would otherwise so\nprobably be the consequence of his highly impracticable turn of mind.\nThe judge was not averse to Felix Graham; but as he himself was a\nman essentially practical in all his views, it often occurred that,\nin his mild kindly way, he ridiculed the young barrister. And Sir\nPeregrine Orme was there, being absent from home as on a very rare\noccasion; and with him of course were Mrs. Orme and his grandson.\nYoung Perry was making, or was prepared to make, somewhat of a\nprolonged stay at Noningsby. He had a horse there with him for the\nhunting, which was changed now and again; his groom going backwards\nand forwards between that place and The Cleeve. Sir Peregrine,\nhowever, intended to return before Christmas, and Mrs. Orme would go\nwith him. He had come for four days, which for him had been a long\nabsence from home, and at the end of the four days he would be gone.\n\nThey were all sitting in the dining-room round the luncheon-table\non a hopelessly wet morning, listening to a lecture from the judge\non the abomination of eating meat in the middle of the day, when a\nservant came behind young Orme's chair and told him that Mr. Mason\nwas in the breakfast-parlour and wished to see him.\n\n\"Who wishes to see you?\" said the baronet in a tone of surprise. He\nhad caught the name, and thought at the moment that it was the owner\nof Groby Park.\n\n\"Lucius Mason,\" said Peregrine, getting up. \"I wonder what he can\nwant me for?\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucius Mason,\" said the grandfather. Since the discourse about\nagriculture he was not personally much attached even to Lucius; but\nfor his mother's sake he could be forgiven.\n\n\"Pray ask him into lunch,\" said Lady Staveley. Something had been\nsaid about Lady Mason since the Ormes had been at Noningsby, and the\nStaveley family were prepared to regard her with sympathy, and if\nnecessary with the right hand of fellowship.\n\n\"He is the great agriculturist, is he not?\" said Augustus. \"Bring him\nin by all means; there is no knowing how much we may not learn before\ndinner on such a day as this.\"\n\n\"He is an ally of mine; and you must not laugh at him,\" said Miss\nFurnival, who was sitting next to Augustus.\n\nBut Lucius Mason did not come in. Young Orme remained with him for\nabout a quarter of an hour, and then returned to the room, declaring\nwith rather a serious face, that he must ride to Hamworth and back\nbefore dinner.\n\n\"Are you going with young Mason?\" asked his grandfather.\n\n\"Yes, sir; he wishes me to do something for him at Hamworth, and I\ncannot well refuse him.\"\n\n\"You are not going to fight a duel!\" said Lady Staveley, holding up\nher hands in horror as the idea came across her brain.\n\n\"A duel!\" screamed Mrs. Orme. \"Oh, Peregrine!\"\n\n\"There can be nothing of the sort,\" said the judge. \"I should think\nthat young Mason is not so foolish; and I am sure that Peregrine Orme\nis not.\"\n\n\"I have not heard of anything of the kind,\" said Peregrine, laughing.\n\n\"Promise me, Peregrine,\" said his mother. \"Say that you promise me.\"\n\n\"My dearest mother, I have no more thought of it than you\nhave;--indeed I may say not so much.\"\n\n\"You will be back to dinner?\" said Lady Staveley.\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly.\"\n\n\"And tell Mr. Mason,\" said the judge, \"that if he will return with\nyou we shall be delighted to see him.\"\n\nThe errand which took Peregrine Orme off to Hamworth will be\nexplained in the next chapter, but his going led to a discussion\namong the gentlemen after dinner as to the position in which Lady\nMason was now placed. There was no longer any possibility of keeping\nthe matter secret, seeing that Mr. Dockwrath had taken great care\nthat every one in Hamworth should hear of it. He had openly declared\nthat evidence would now be adduced to prove that Sir Joseph Mason's\nwidow had herself forged the will, and had said to many people that\nMr. Mason of Groby had determined to indict her for forgery. This\nhad gone so far that Lucius had declared as openly that he would\nprosecute the attorney for a libel, and Dockwrath had sent him word\nthat he was quite welcome to do so if he pleased.\n\n\"It is a scandalous state of things,\" said Sir Peregrine, speaking\nwith much enthusiasm, and no little temper, on the subject. \"Here is\na question which was settled twenty years ago to the satisfaction of\nevery one who knew anything of the case, and now it is brought up\nagain that two men may wreak their vengeance on a poor widow. They\nare not men; they are brutes.\"\n\n\"But why does she not bring an action against this attorney?\" said\nyoung Staveley.\n\n\"Such actions do not easily lie,\" said his father. \"It may be quite\ntrue that Dockwrath may have said all manner of evil things against\nthis lady, and yet it may be very difficult to obtain evidence of a\nlibel. It seems to me from what I have heard that the man himself\nwishes such an action to be brought.\"\n\n\"And think of the state of poor Lady Mason!\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\"Conceive the misery which it would occasion her if she were dragged\nforward to give evidence on such a matter!\"\n\n\"I believe it would kill her,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"The best means of assisting her would be to give her some\ncountenance,\" said the judge; \"and from all that I can hear of her,\nshe deserves it.\"\n\n\"She does deserve it,\" said Sir Peregrine, \"and she shall have it.\nThe people at Hamworth shall see at any rate that my daughter regards\nher as a fit associate. I am happy to say that she is coming to The\nCleeve on my return home, and that she will remain there till after\nChristmas.\"\n\n\"It is a very singular case,\" said Felix Graham, who had been\nthinking over the position of the lady hitherto in silence.\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said the judge; \"and it shows how careful men should\nbe in all matters relating to their wills. The will and the codicil,\nas it appears, are both in the handwriting of the widow, who acted\nas an amanuensis not only for her husband but for the attorney. That\nfact does not in my mind produce suspicion; but I do not doubt that\nit has produced all this suspicion in the mind of the claimant. The\nattorney who advised Sir Joseph should have known better.\"\n\n\"It is one of those cases,\" continued Graham, \"in which the sufferer\nshould be protected by the very fact of her own innocence. No lawyer\nshould consent to take up the cudgels against her.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that she will not escape persecution from any such\nprofessional chivalry,\" said the judge.\n\n\"All that is moonshine,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"And moonshine is a very pretty thing if you were not too much afraid\nof the night air to go and look at it. If the matter be as you all\nsay, I do think that any gentleman would disgrace himself by lending\na hand against her.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sir, I fully agree with you,\" said Sir Peregrine,\nbowing to Felix Graham over his glass.\n\n\"I will take permission to think, Sir Peregrine,\" said Mr. Furnival,\n\"that you would not agree with Mr. Graham if you had given to the\nmatter much deep consideration.\"\n\n\"I have not had the advantage of a professional education,\" said Sir\nPeregrine, again bowing, and on this occasion addressing himself to\nthe lawyer; \"but I cannot see how any amount of learning should alter\nmy views on such a subject.\"\n\n\"Truth and honour cannot be altered by any professional\narrangements,\" said Graham; and then the conversation turned away\nfrom Lady Mason, and directed itself to those great corrections of\nlegal reform which had been debated during the past autumn.\n\nThe Orley Farm Case, though in other forms and different language,\nwas being discussed also in the drawing-room. \"I have not seen much\nof her,\" said Sophia Furnival, who by some art had usurped the most\nprominent part in the conversation, \"but what I did see I liked much.\nShe was at The Cleeve when I was staying there, if you remember, Mrs.\nOrme.\" Mrs. Orme said that she did remember.\n\n\"And we went over to Orley Farm. Poor lady! I think everybody ought\nto notice her under such circumstances. Papa, I know, would move\nheaven and earth for her if he could.\"\n\n\"I cannot move the heaven or the earth either,\" said Lady Staveley;\n\"but if I thought that my calling on her would be any satisfaction to\nher--\"\n\n\"It would, Lady Staveley,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"It would be a great\nsatisfaction to her. I cannot tell you how warmly I regard her, nor\nhow perfectly Sir Peregrine esteems her.\"\n\n\"We will drive over there next week, Madeline.\"\n\n\"Do, mamma. Everybody says that she is very nice.\"\n\n\"It will be so kind of you, Lady Staveley,\" said Sophia Furnival.\n\n\"Next week she will be staying with us,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"And that\nwould save you three miles, you know, and we should be so glad to see\nyou.\"\n\nLady Staveley declared that she would do both. She would call at\nThe Cleeve, and again at Orley Farm after Lady Mason's return home.\nShe well understood, though she could not herself then say so, that\nthe greater part of the advantage to be received from her kindness\nwould be derived from its being known at Hamworth that the Staveley\ncarriage had been driven up to Lady Mason's door.\n\n\"Her son is very clever, is he not?\" said Madeline, addressing\nherself to Miss Furnival.\n\nSophia shrugged her shoulders and put her head on one side with a\npretty grace. \"Yes, I believe so. People say so. But who is to tell\nwhether a young man be clever or no?\"\n\n\"But some are so much more clever than others. Don't you think so?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, as some girls are so much prettier than others. But if Mr.\nMason were to talk Greek to you, you would not think him clever.\"\n\n\"I should not understand him, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course not; but you would understand that he was a blockhead to\nshow off his learning in that way. You don't want him to be clever,\nyou see; you only want him to be agreeable.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I want either the one or the other.\"\n\n\"Do you not? I know I do. I think that young men in society are bound\nto be agreeable, and that they should not be there if they do not\nknow how to talk pleasantly, and to give something in return for all\nthe trouble we take for them.\"\n\n\"I don't take any trouble for them,\" said Madeline laughing.\n\n\"Surely you must, if you only think of it. All ladies do, and so they\nought. But if in return for that a man merely talks Greek to me, I,\nfor my part, do not think that the bargain is fairly carried out.\"\n\n\"I declare you will make me quite afraid of Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Oh, he never talks Greek;--at least he never has to me. I rather\nlike him. But what I mean is this, that I do not think a man a bit\nmore likely to be agreeable because he has the reputation of being\nvery clever. For my part I rather think that I like stupid young\nmen.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you? Then now I shall know what you think of Augustus. We\nthink he is very clever; but I do not know any man who makes himself\nmore popular with young ladies.\"\n\n\"Ah, then he is a gay deceiver.\"\n\n\"He is gay enough, but I am sure he is no deceiver. A man may make\nhimself nice to young ladies without deceiving any of them; may he\nnot?\"\n\n\"You must not take me 'au pied de la lettre,' Miss Staveley, or I\nshall be lost. Of course he may. But when young gentlemen are so very\nnice, young ladies are so apt to--\"\n\n\"To what?\"\n\n\"Not to fall in love with them exactly, but to be ready to be fallen\nin love with, and then if a man does do it he is a deceiver. I\ndeclare it seems to me that we don't allow them a chance of going\nright.\"\n\n\"I think that Augustus manages to steer through such difficulties\nvery cleverly.\"\n\n\"He sails about in the open sea, touching at all the most lovely\ncapes and promontories, and is never driven on shore by stress of\nweather! What a happy sailor he must be!\"\n\n\"I think he is happy, and that he makes others so.\"\n\n\"He ought to be made an admiral at once But we shall hear some day of\nhis coming to a terrible shipwreck.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope not!\"\n\n\"He will return home in desperate plight, with only two planks left\ntogether, with all his glory and beauty broken and crumpled to pieces\nagainst some rock that he has despised in his pride.\"\n\n\"Why do you prophesy such terrible things for him?\"\n\n\"I mean that he will get married.\"\n\n\"Get married! of course he will. That's just what we all want. You\ndon't call that a shipwreck; do you?\"\n\n\"It's the sort of shipwreck that these very gallant barks have to\nencounter.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that he'll marry a disagreeable wife!\"\n\n\"Oh, no; not in the least. I only mean to say that like other sons of\nAdam, he will have to strike his colours. I dare say, if the truth\nwere known, he has done so already.\"\n\n\"I am sure he has not.\"\n\n\"I don't at all ask to know his secrets, and I should look upon you\nas a very bad sister if you told them.\"\n\n\"But I am sure he has not got any,--of that kind.\"\n\n\"Would he tell you if he had?\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope so; any serious secret. I am sure he ought, for I am\nalways thinking about him.\"\n\n\"And would you tell him your secrets?\"\n\n\"I have none.\"\n\n\"But when you have, will you do so?\"\n\n\"Will I? Well, yes; I think so. But a girl has no such secret,\" she\ncontinued to say, after pausing for a moment. \"None, generally, at\nleast, which she tells, even to herself, till the time comes in\nwhich she tells it to all whom she really loves.\" And then there was\nanother pause for a moment.\n\n\"I am not quite so sure of that,\" said Miss Furnival. After which the\ngentlemen came into the drawing-room.\n\nAugustus Staveley had gone to work in a manner which he conceived to\nbe quite systematic, having before him the praiseworthy object of\nmaking a match between Felix Graham and Sophia Furnival. \"By George,\nGraham,\" he had said, \"the finest girl in London is coming down to\nNoningsby; upon my word I think she is.\"\n\n\"And brought there expressly for your delectation, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh no, not at all; indeed, she is not exactly in my style; she is\ntoo,--too,--too--in point of fact, too much of a girl for me. She has\nlots of money, and is very clever, and all that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"I never knew you so humble before.\"\n\n\"I am not joking at all. She is a daughter of old Furnival's, whom\nby-the-by I hate as I do poison. Why my governor has him down at\nNoningsby I can't guess. But I tell you what, old fellow, he can give\nhis daughter five-and-twenty thousand pounds. Think of that, Master\nBrook.\" But Felix Graham was a man who could not bring himself to\nthink much of such things on the spur of the moment, and when he was\nintroduced to Sophia, he did not seem to be taken with her in any\nwonderful way.\n\nAugustus had asked his mother to help him, but she had laughed at\nhim. \"It would be a splendid arrangement,\" he had said with energy.\n\"Nonsense, Gus,\" she had answered. \"You should always let those\nthings take their chance. All I will ask of you is that you don't\nfall in love with her yourself; I don't think her family would be\nnice enough for you.\"\n\nBut Felix Graham certainly was ungrateful for the friendship spent\nupon him, and so his friend felt it. Augustus had contrived to\nwhisper into the lady's ear that Mr. Graham was the cleverest young\nman now rising at the bar, and as far as she was concerned, some\namount of intimacy might at any rate have been produced; but he,\nGraham himself, would not put himself forward. \"I will pique him into\nit,\" said Augustus to himself, and therefore when on this occasion\nthey came into the drawing-room, Staveley immediately took a vacant\nseat beside Miss Furnival, with the very friendly object which he had\nproposed to himself.\n\nThere was great danger in this, for Miss Furnival was certainly\nhandsome, and Augustus Staveley was very susceptible. But what will\nnot a man go through for his friend? \"I hope we are to have the\nhonour of your company as far as Monkton Grange the day we meet\nthere,\" he said. The hounds were to meet at Monkton Grange, some\nseven miles from Noningsby, and all the sportsmen from the house were\nto be there.\n\n\"I shall be delighted,\" said Sophia, \"that is to say if a seat in the\ncarriage can be spared for me.\"\n\n\"But we'll mount you. I know that you are a horsewoman.\" In answer to\nwhich Miss Furnival confessed that she was a horsewoman, and owned\nalso to having brought a habit and hat with her.\n\n\"That will be delightful. Madeline will ride also, and you will meet\nthe Miss Tristrams. They are the famous horsewomen of this part of\nthe country.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that they go after the dogs, across the hedges.\"\n\n\"Indeed they do.\"\n\n\"And does Miss Staveley do that?\"\n\n\"Oh, no--Madeline is not good at a five-barred gate, and would make\nbut a very bad hand at a double ditch. If you are inclined to remain\namong the tame people, she will be true to your side.\"\n\n\"I shall certainly be one of the tame people, Mr. Staveley.\"\n\n\"I rather think I shall be with you myself; I have only one horse\nthat will jump well, and Graham will ride him. By-the-by, Miss\nFurnival, what do you think of my friend Graham?\"\n\n\"Think of him! Am I bound to have thought anything about him by this\ntime?\"\n\n\"Of course you are;--or at any rate of course you have. I have\nno doubt that you have composed in your own mind an essay on the\ncharacter of everybody here. People who think at all always do.\"\n\n\"Do they? My essay upon him then is a very short one.\"\n\n\"But perhaps not the less correct on that account. You must allow me\nto read it.\"\n\n\"Like all my other essays of that kind, Mr. Staveley, it has been\ncomposed solely for my own use, and will be kept quite private.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry for that, for I intended to propose a bargain to you.\nIf you would have shown me some of your essays, I would have been\nequally liberal with some of mine.\" And in this way, before the\nevening was over, Augustus Staveley and Miss Furnival became very\ngood friends.\n\n\"Upon my word she is a very clever girl,\" he said afterwards, as\nyoung Orme and Graham were sitting with him in an outside room which\nhad been fitted up for smoking.\n\n\"And uncommonly handsome,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"And they say she'll have lots of money,\" said Graham. \"After all,\nStaveley, perhaps you could not do better.\"\n\n\"She's not my style at all,\" said he. \"But of course a man is obliged\nto be civil to girls in his own house.\" And then they all went to\nbed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nMR. DOCKWRATH IN HIS OWN OFFICE.\n\n\nIn the conversation which had taken place after dinner at Noningsby\nwith regard to the Masons Peregrine Orme took no part, but his\nsilence had not arisen from any want of interest on the subject.\nHe had been over to Hamworth that day on a very special mission\nregarding it, and as he was not inclined to speak of what he had then\nseen and done, he held his tongue altogether.\n\n\"I want you to do me a great favour,\" Lucius had said to him, when\nthe two were together in the breakfast-parlour at Noningsby; \"but I\nam afraid it will give you some trouble.\"\n\n\"I sha'n't mind that,\" said Peregrine, \"if that's all.\"\n\n\"You have heard of this row about Joseph Mason and my mother? It has\nbeen so talked of that I fear you must have heard it.\"\n\n\"About the lawsuit? Oh yes. It has certainly been spoken of at The\nCleeve.\"\n\n\"Of course it has. All the world is talking of it. Now there is a man\nnamed Dockwrath in Hamworth--;\" and then he went on to explain how it\nhad reached him from various quarters that Mr. Dockwrath was accusing\nhis mother of the crime of forgery; how he had endeavoured to\npersuade his mother to indict the man for libel; how his mother had\npleaded to him with tears in her eyes that she found it impossible to\ngo through such an ordeal; and how he, therefore, had resolved to go\nhimself to Mr. Dockwrath. \"But,\" said he, \"I must have some one with\nme, some gentleman whom I can trust, and therefore I have ridden over\nto ask you to accompany me as far as Hamworth.\"\n\n\"I suppose he is not a man that you can kick,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"I am afraid not,\" said Lucius; \"he's over forty years old, and has\ndozens of children.\"\n\n\"And then he is such a low beast,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"I have no idea of kicking him, but I think it would be wrong to\nallow him to go on saying these frightful things of my mother,\nwithout showing him that we are not afraid of him.\" Upon this the\ntwo young men got on horseback, and riding into Hamworth, put their\nhorses up at the inn.\n\n\"And now I suppose we might as well go at once,\" said Peregrine, with\na very serious face.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other; \"there's nothing to delay us. I cannot tell\nyou how much obliged I am to you for coming with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't say anything about that; of course I'm only too happy.\"\nBut all the same he felt that his heart was beating, and that he\nwas a little nervous. Had he been called upon to go in and thrash\nsomebody, he would have been quite at home; but he did not feel at\nhis ease in making an inimical visit to an attorney's office.\n\nIt would have been wise, perhaps, if in this matter Lucius had\nsubmitted himself to Lady Mason's wishes. On the previous evening\nthey had talked the matter over with much serious energy. Lucius\nhad been told in the streets of Hamworth by an intermeddling little\nbusybody of an apothecary that it behoved him to do something, as Mr.\nDockwrath was making grievous accusations against his mother. Lucius\nhad replied haughtily, that he and his mother would know how to\nprotect themselves, and the apothecary had retreated, resolving to\nspread the report everywhere. Lucius on his return home had declared\nto the unfortunate lady that she had now no alternative left to her.\nShe must bring an action against the man, or at any rate put the\nmatter into the hands of a lawyer with a view of ascertaining whether\nshe could do so with any chance of success. If she could not, she\nmust then make known her reason for remaining quiet. In answer to\nthis, Lady Mason had begun by praying her son to allow the matter to\npass by.\n\n\"But it will not pass by,\" Lucius had said.\n\n\"Yes, dearest, if we leave it, it will,--in a month or two. We can do\nnothing by interference. Remember the old saying, You cannot touch\npitch without being defiled.\"\n\nBut Lucius had replied, almost with anger, that the pitch had already\ntouched him, and that he was defiled. \"I cannot consent to hold the\nproperty,\" he had said, \"unless something be done.\" And then his\nmother had bowed her head as she sat, and had covered her face with\nher hands.\n\n\"I shall go to the man myself,\" Lucius had declared with energy.\n\n\"As your mother, Lucius, I implore you not to do so,\" she had said to\nhim through her tears.\n\n\"I must either do that or leave the country. It is impossible that I\nshould live here, hearing such things said of you, and doing nothing\nto clear your name.\" To this she had made no actual reply, and now\nhe was standing at the attorney's door about to do that which he had\nthreatened.\n\nThey found Mr. Dockwrath sitting at his desk at the other side of\nwhich was seated his clerk. He had not yet promoted himself to the\ndignity of a private office, but generally used his parlour as such\nwhen he was desirous of seeing his clients without disturbance. On\nthis occasion, however, when he saw young Mason enter, he made no\noffer to withdraw. His hat was on his head as he sat on his stool,\nand he did not even take it off as he returned the stiff salutation\nof his visitor. \"Keep your hat on your head, Mr. Orme,\" he said, as\nPeregrine was about to take his off. \"Well, gentlemen, what can I do\nfor you?\"\n\nLucius looked at the clerk, and felt that there would be great\ndifficulty in talking about his mother before such a witness. \"We\nwish to see you in private, Mr. Dockwrath, for a few minutes--if it\nbe convenient.\"\n\n\"Is not this private enough?\" said Dockwrath. \"There is no one here\nbut my confidential clerk.\"\n\n\"If you could make it convenient--\" began Lucius.\n\n\"Well, then, Mr. Mason, I cannot make it convenient, and there is the\nlong and the short of it. You have brought Mr. Orme with you to hear\nwhat you've got to say, and I choose that my clerk shall remain by\nto hear it also. Seeing the position in which you stand there is no\nknowing what may come of such an interview as this.\"\n\n\"In what position do I stand, sir?\"\n\n\"If you don't know, Mr. Mason, I am not going to tell you. I feel\nfor you, I do upon my word. I feel for you, and I pity you.\" Mr.\nDockwrath as he thus expressed his commiseration was sitting with his\nhigh chair tilted back, with his knees against the edge of his desk,\nwith his hat almost down upon his nose as he looked at his visitors\nfrom under it, and he amused himself by cutting up a quill pen into\nsmall pieces with his penknife. It was not pleasant to be pitied by\nsuch a man as that, and so Peregrine Orme conceived.\n\n\"Sir, that is nonsense,\" said Lucius. \"I require no pity from you or\nfrom any man.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there is one in all Hamworth that does not feel for\nyou,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"He means to be impudent,\" said Peregrine. \"You had better come to\nthe point with him at once.\"\n\n\"No, I don't mean to be impudent, young gentleman. A man may speak\nhis own mind in his own house I suppose without any impudence. You\nwouldn't stand cap in hand to me if I were to go down to you at The\nCleeve.\"\n\n\"I have come here to ask of you,\" said Lucius, \"whether it be true\nthat you are spreading these reports about the town with reference to\nLady Mason. If you are a man you will tell me the truth.\"\n\n\"Well; I rather think I am a man.\"\n\n\"It is necessary that Lady Mason should be protected from such\ninfamous falsehoods, and it may be necessary to bring the matter into\na court of law--\"\n\n\"You may be quite easy about that, Mr. Mason. It will be necessary.\"\n\n\"As it may be necessary, I wish to know whether you will acknowledge\nthat these reports have come from you?\"\n\n\"You want me to give evidence against myself. Well, for once in a way\nI don't mind if I do. The reports have come from me. Now, is that\nmanly?\" And Mr. Dockwrath, as he spoke, pushed his hat somewhat off\nhis nose, and looked steadily across into the face of his opponent.\n\nLucius Mason was too young for the task which he had undertaken, and\nallowed himself to be disconcerted. He had expected that the lawyer\nwould deny the charge, and was prepared for what he would say and do\nin such a case; but now he was not prepared.\n\n\"How on earth could you bring yourself to be guilty of such\nvillainy?\" said young Orme.\n\n\"Highty-tighty! What are you talking about, young man? The fact is,\nyou do not know what you are talking about. But as I have a respect\nfor your grandfather and for your mother I will give you and them a\npiece of advice, gratis. Don't let them be too thick with Lady Mason\ntill they see how this matter goes.\"\n\n\"Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Lucius, \"you are a mean, low, vile scoundrel.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. Adams, just take a note of that. Don't mind what Mr.\nOrme said. I can easily excuse him. He'll know the truth before long,\nand then he'll beg my pardon.\"\n\n\"I'll take my oath I look upon you as the greatest miscreant that\never I met,\" said Peregrine, who was of course bound to support his\nfriend.\n\n\"You'll change your mind, Mr. Orme, before long, and then you'll find\nthat you have met a worse miscreant than I am. Did you put down those\nwords, Adams?\"\n\n\"Them as Mr. Mason spoke? Yes; I've got them down.\"\n\n\"Read them,\" said the master.\n\nAnd the clerk read them, \"Mr. Dockwrath, you are a mean, low, vile\nscoundrel.\"\n\n\"And now, young gentlemen, if you have got nothing else to observe,\nas I am rather busy, perhaps you will allow me to wish you good\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Mason; \"you may be sure that you\nwill hear further from me.\"\n\n\"We shall be sure to hear of each other. There is no doubt in the\nworld about that,\" said the attorney. And then the two young men\nwithdrew with an unexpressed feeling in the mind of each of them,\nthat they had not so completely got the better of their antagonist as\nthe justice of their case demanded.\n\nThey then remounted their horses, and Orme accompanied his friend as\nfar as Orley Farm, from whence he got into the Alston road through\nThe Cleeve grounds. \"And what do you intend to do now?\" said\nPeregrine as soon as they were mounted.\n\n\"I shall employ a lawyer,\" said he, \"on my own footing; not my\nmother's lawyer, but some one else. Then I suppose I shall be guided\nby his advice.\" Had he done this before he made his visit to Mr.\nDockwrath, perhaps it might have been better. All this sat very\nheavily on poor Peregrine's mind; and therefore as the company were\ntalking about Lady Mason after dinner, he remained silent, listening,\nbut not joining in the conversation.\n\nThe whole of that evening Lucius and his mother sat together, saying\nnothing. There was not absolutely any quarrel between them, but on\nthis terrible subject there was an utter want of accordance, and\nalmost of sympathy. It was not that Lucius had ever for a moment\nsuspected his mother of aught that was wrong. Had he done so he\nmight perhaps have been more gentle towards her in his thoughts and\nwords. He not only fully trusted her, but he was quite fixed in\nhis confidence that nothing could shake either her or him in their\nrights. But under these circumstances he could not understand how she\ncould consent to endure without resistance the indignities which were\nput upon her. \"She should combat them for my sake, if not for her\nown,\" he said to himself over and over again. And he had said so also\nto her, but his words had had no effect.\n\nShe, on the other hand, felt that he was cruel to her. She was\nweighed down almost to the ground by these sufferings which had\nfallen on her, and yet he would not be gentle and soft to her. She\ncould have borne it all, she thought, if he would have borne with\nher. She still hoped that if she remained quiet no further trial\nwould take place. At any rate this might be so. That it would be so\nshe had the assurance of Mr. Furnival. And yet all this evil which\nshe dreaded worse than death was to be precipitated on her by her\nson! So they sat through the long evening, speechless; each seated\nwith the pretence of reading, but neither of them capable of the\nattention which a book requires.\n\nHe did not tell her then that he had been with Mr. Dockwrath, but she\nknew by his manner that he had taken some terrible step. She waited\npatiently the whole evening, hoping that he would tell her, but when\nthe hour came for her to go up to her room he had told her nothing.\nIf he now were to turn against her, that would be worse than all! She\nwent up to her room and sat herself down to think. All that passed\nthrough her brain on that night I may not now tell; but the grief\nwhich pressed on her at this moment with peculiar weight was the\nself-will and obstinacy of her boy. She said to herself that she\nwould be willing now to die,--to give back her life at once, if such\nmight be God's pleasure; but that her son should bring down her hairs\nwith shame and sorrow to the grave--! In that thought there was a\nbitterness of agony which she knew not how to endure!\n\nThe next morning at breakfast he still remained silent, and his brow\nwas still black. \"Lucius,\" she said, \"did you do anything in that\nmatter yesterday?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother; I saw Mr. Dockwrath.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I took Peregrine Orme with me that I might have a witness, and I\nthen asked him whether he had spread these reports. He acknowledged\nthat he had done so, and I told him that he was a villain.\"\n\nUpon hearing this she uttered a long, low sigh, but she said nothing.\nWhat use could there now be in her saying aught? Her look of agony\nwent to the young man's heart, but he still thought that he had been\nright. \"Mother,\" he continued to say, \"I am very sorry to grieve\nyou in this way;--very sorry. But I could not hold up my head in\nHamworth,--I could not hold up my head anywhere, if I heard these\nthings said of you and did not resent it.\"\n\n\"Ah, Lucius, if you knew the weakness of a woman!\"\n\n\"And therefore you should let me bear it all. There is nothing I\nwould not suffer; no cost I would not undergo rather than you should\nendure all this. If you would only say that you would leave it to\nme!\"\n\n\"But it cannot be left to you. I have gone to a lawyer, to Mr.\nFurnival. Why will you not permit that I should act in it as he\nthinks best? Can you not believe that that will be the best for both\nof us?\"\n\n\"If you wish it, I will see Mr. Furnival.\"\n\nLady Mason did not wish that, but she was obliged so far to yield as\nto say that he might do so if he would. Her wish was that he should\nbear it all and say nothing. It was not that she was indifferent to\ngood repute among her neighbours, or that she was careless as to what\nthe apothecaries and attorneys said of her; but it was easier for\nher to bear the evil than to combat it. The Ormes and the Furnivals\nwould support her. They and such-like persons would acknowledge her\nweakness, and would know that from her would not be expected such\nloud outbursting indignation as might be expected from a man. She had\ncalculated the strength of her own weakness, and thought that she\nmight still be supported by that,--if only her son would so permit.\n\nIt was two days after this that Lucius was allowed the honour of\na conference by appointment with the great lawyer; and at the\nexpiration of an hour's delay he was shown into the room by Mr.\nCrabwitz. \"And, Crabwitz,\" said the barrister, before he addressed\nhimself to his young friend, \"just run your eye over those papers,\nand let Mr. Bideawhile have them to-morrow morning; and, Crabwitz--.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"That opinion of Sir Richard's in the Ahatualpaca Mining Company--I\nhave not seen it, have I?\"\n\n\"It's all ready, Mr. Furnival.\"\n\n\"I will look at it in five minutes. And now, my young friend, what\ncan I do for you?\"\n\nIt was quite clear from Mr. Furnival's tone and manner that he did\nnot mean to devote much time to Lucius Mason, and that he was not\ngenerally anxious to hold any conversation with him on the subject in\nquestion. Such, indeed, was the case. Mr. Furnival was determined to\npull Lady Mason out of the sea of trouble into which she had fallen,\nlet the effort cost him what it might, but he did not wish to do so\nby the instrumentality, or even with the aid, of her son.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival,\" began Mason, \"I want to ask your advice about these\ndreadful reports which are being spread on every side in Hamworth\nabout my mother.\"\n\n\"If you will allow me then to say so, I think that the course which\nyou should pursue is very simple. Indeed there is, I think, only one\ncourse which you can pursue with proper deference to your mother's\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"And what is that, Mr. Furnival?\"\n\n\"Do nothing, and say nothing. I fear from what I have heard that you\nhave already done and said much more than was prudent.\"\n\n\"But how am I to hear such things as these spoken of my own mother?\"\n\n\"That depends on the people by whom the things are spoken. In this\nworld, if we meet a chimney-sweep in the path we do not hustle with\nhim for the right of way. Your mother is going next week to The\nCleeve. It was only yesterday that I heard that the Noningsby people\nare going to call on her. You can hardly, I suppose, desire for your\nmother better friends than such as these. And can you not understand\nwhy such people gather to her at this moment? If you can understand\nit you will not trouble yourself to interfere much more with Mr.\nDockwrath.\"\n\nThere was a rebuke in this which Lucius Mason was forced to endure;\nbut nevertheless as he retreated disconcerted from the barrister's\nchambers, he could not bring himself to think it right that such\ncalumny should be borne without resistance. He knew but little as yet\nof the ordinary life of gentlemen in England; but he did know,--so at\nleast he thought,--that it was the duty of a son to shield his mother\nfrom insult and libel.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nCHRISTMAS IN HARLEY STREET.\n\n\nIt seems singular to me myself, considering the idea which I have\nin my own mind of the character of Lady Staveley, that I should be\ndriven to declare that about this time she committed an unpardonable\noffence, not only against good nature, but also against the domestic\nproprieties. But I am driven so to say, although she herself was of\nall women the most good-natured and most domestic; for she asked\nMr. Furnival to pass his Christmas-day at Noningsby, and I find it\nimpossible to forgive her that offence against the poor wife whom in\nthat case he must leave alone by her desolate hearth. She knew that\nhe was a married man as well as I do. Sophia, who had a proper regard\nfor the domestic peace of her parents, and who could have been happy\nat Noningsby without a father's care, not unfrequently spoke of her,\nso that her existence in Harley Street might not be forgotten by\nthe Staveleys--explaining, however, as she did so, that her dear\nmother never left her own fireside in winter, so that no suspicion\nmight be entertained that an invitation was desired for her also;\nnevertheless, in spite of all this, on two separate occasions did\nLady Staveley say to Mr. Furnival that he might as well prolong his\nvisit over Christmas.\n\nAnd yet Lady Staveley was not attached to Mr. Furnival with any\npeculiar warmth of friendship; but she was one of those women whose\nfoolish hearts will not allow themselves to be controlled in the\nexercise of their hospitality. Her nature demanded of her that she\nshould ask a guest to stay. She would not have allowed a dog to\ndepart from her house at this season of the year, without suggesting\nto him that he had better take his Christmas bone in her yard. It\nwas for Mr. Furnival to adjust all matters between himself and his\nwife. He was not bound to accept the invitation because she gave it;\nbut she, finding him there, already present in the house, did feel\nherself bound to give it;--for which offence, as I have said before,\nI cannot bring myself to forgive her.\n\nAt his sin in staying away from home, or rather--as far as the story\nhas yet carried us--in thinking that he would do so, I am by no means\nso much surprised. An angry ill-pleased wife is no pleasant companion\nfor a gentleman on a long evening. For those who have managed that\nthings shall run smoothly over the domestic rug there is no happier\ntime of life than these long candlelight hours of home and silence.\nNo spoken content or uttered satisfaction is necessary. The fact that\nis felt is enough for peace. But when the fact is not felt; when\nthe fact is by no means there; when the thoughts are running in a\ndirection altogether different; when bitter grievances from one to\nthe other fill the heart, rather than memories of mutual kindness;\nthen, I say, those long candlelight hours of home and silence are not\neasy of endurance. Mr. Furnival was a man who chose to be the master\nof his own destiny, so at least to himself he boasted; and therefore\nwhen he found himself encountered by black looks and occasionally by\nsullen words, he declared to himself that he was ill-used and that he\nwould not bear it. Since the domestic rose would no longer yield him\nhoney, he would seek his sweets from the stray honeysuckle on which\nthere grew no thorns.\n\nMr. Furnival was no coward. He was not one of those men who wrong\ntheir wives by their absence, and then prolong their absence because\nthey are afraid to meet their wives. His resolve was to be free\nhimself, and to be free without complaint from her. He would have\nit so, that he might remain out of his own house for a month at the\ntime and then return to it for a week--at any rate without outward\nbickerings. I have known other men who have dreamed of such a state\nof things, but at this moment I can remember none who have brought\ntheir dream to bear.\n\nMr. Furnival had written to his wife,--not from Noningsby, but\nfrom some provincial town, probably situated among the Essex\nmarshes,--saying various things, and among others that he should\nnot, as he thought, be at home at Christmas-day. Mrs. Furnival had\nremarked about a fortnight since that Christmas-day was nothing to\nher now; and the base man, for it was base, had hung upon this poor,\nsore-hearted word an excuse for remaining away from home. \"There are\nlawyers of repute staying at Noningsby,\" he had said, \"with whom it\nis very expedient that I should remain at this present crisis.\"--When\nyet has there been no crisis present to a man who has wanted an\nexcuse?--\"And therefore I may probably stay,\"--and so on. Who does\nnot know the false mixture of excuse and defiance which such a letter\nis sure to maintain; the crafty words which may be taken as adequate\nreason if the receiver be timid enough so to receive them, or as a\nnoisy gauntlet thrown to the ground if there be spirit there for the\npicking of it up? Such letter from his little borough in the Essex\nmarshes did Mr. Furnival write to the partner of his cares, and there\nwas still sufficient spirit left for the picking up of the gauntlet.\n\"I shall be home to-morrow,\" the letter had gone on to say, \"but\nI will not keep you waiting for dinner, as my hours are always so\nuncertain. I shall be at my chambers till late, and will be with you\nbefore tea. I will then return to Alston on the following morning.\"\nThere was at any rate good courage in this on the part of Mr.\nFurnival;--great courage; but with it coldness of heart, dishonesty\nof purpose, and black ingratitude. Had she not given everything to\nhim?\n\nMrs. Furnival when she got the letter was not alone. \"There,\"\nsaid she; throwing it over to a lady who sat on the other side of\nthe fireplace handling a loose sprawling mass of not very clean\ncrochet-work. \"I knew he would stay away on Christmas-day. I told you\nso.\"\n\n\"I didn't think it possible,\" said Miss Biggs, rolling up the big\nball of soiled cotton, that she might read Mr. Furnival's letter at\nher leisure. \"I didn't really think it possible--on Christmas-day!\nSurely, Mrs. Furnival, he can't mean Christmas-day? Dear, dear, dear!\nand then to throw it in your face in that way that you said you\ndidn't care about it.\"\n\n\"Of course I said so,\" answered Mrs. Furnival. \"I was not going to\nask him to come home as a favour.\"\n\n\"Not to make a favour of it, of course not.\" This was Miss Biggs\nfrom ----. I am afraid if I tell the truth I must say that she came\nfrom Red Lion Square! And yet nothing could be more respectable than\nMiss Biggs. Her father had been a partner with an uncle of Mrs.\nFurnival's; and when Kitty Blacker had given herself and her young\nprettinesses to the hardworking lawyer, Martha Biggs had stood at the\naltar with her, then just seventeen years of age, and had promised\nto her all manner of success for her coming life. Martha Biggs had\nnever, not even then, been pretty; but she had been very faithful.\nShe had not been a favourite with Mr. Furnival, having neither wit\nnor grace to recommend her, and therefore in the old happy days of\nKeppel Street she had been kept in the background; but now, in this\npresent time of her adversity, Mrs. Furnival found the benefit of\nhaving a trusty friend.\n\n\"If he likes better to be with these people down at Alston, I am sure\nit is the same to me,\" said the injured wife.\n\n\"But there's nobody special at Alston, is there?\" asked Miss Biggs,\nwhose soul sighed for a tale more piquant than one of mere general\nneglect. She knew that her friend had dreadful suspicions, but Mrs.\nFurnival had never as yet committed herself by uttering the name of\nany woman as her rival. Miss Biggs thought that a time had now come\nin which the strength of their mutual confidence demanded that such\nname should be uttered. It could not be expected that she should\nsympathise with generalities for ever. She longed to hate, to\nreprobate, and to shudder at the actual name of the wretch who had\nrobbed her friend of a husband's heart. And therefore she asked the\nquestion, \"There's nobody special at Alston, is there?\"\n\nNow Mrs. Furnival knew to a furlong the distance from Noningsby to\nOrley Farm, and knew also that the station at Hamworth was only\ntwenty-five minutes from that at Alston. She gave no immediate\nanswer, but threw up her head and shook her nostrils, as though she\nwere preparing for war; and then Miss Martha Biggs knew that there\nwas somebody special at Alston. Between such old friends why should\nnot the name be mentioned?\n\nOn the following day the two ladies dined at six, and then waited tea\npatiently till ten. Had the thirst of a desert been raging within\nthat drawing-room, and had tea been within immediate call, those\nladies would have died ere they would have asked for it before his\nreturn. He had said he would be home to tea, and they would have\nwaited for him, had it been till four o'clock in the morning! Let the\nfemale married victim ever make the most of such positive wrongs as\nProvidence may vouchsafe to her. Had Mrs. Furnival ordered tea on\nthis evening before her husband's return, she would have been a woman\nblind to the advantages of her own position. At ten the wheels of Mr.\nFurnival's cab were heard, and the faces of both the ladies prepared\nthemselves for the encounter.\n\n\"Well, Kitty, how are you?\" said Mr. Furnival, entering the room with\nhis arms prepared for a premeditated embrace. \"What, Miss Biggs with\nyou? I did not know. How do you do, Miss Biggs?\" and Mr. Furnival\nextended his hand to the lady. They both looked at him, and they\ncould tell from the brightness of his eye and from the colour of his\nnose that he had been dining at his club, and that the bin with the\nprecious cork had been visited on his behalf.\n\n\"Yes, my dear, it's rather lonely being here in this big room all\nby oneself so long; so I asked Martha Biggs to come over to me. I\nsuppose there's no harm in that.\"\n\n\"Oh, if I'm in the way,\" began Miss Biggs, \"or if Mr. Furnival is\ngoing to stay at home for long--\"\n\n\"You are not in the way, and I am not going to stay at home for\nlong,\" said Mr. Furnival, speaking with a voice that was perhaps a\nlittle thick,--only a very little thick. No wife on good terms with\nher husband would have deigned to notice, even in her own mind, an\namount of thickness of voice which was so very inconsiderable. But\nMrs. Furnival at the present moment did notice it.\n\n\"Oh, I did not know,\" said Miss Biggs.\n\n\"You know now,\" said Mr. Furnival, whose ear at once appreciated the\nhostility of tone which had been assumed.\n\n\"You need not be rude to my friend after she has been waiting tea for\nyou till near eleven o'clock,\" said Mrs. Furnival. \"It is nothing to\nme, but you should remember that she is not used to it.\"\n\n\"I wasn't rude to your friend, and who asked you to wait tea till\nnear eleven o'clock? It is only just ten now, if that signifies.\"\n\n\"You expressly desired me to wait tea, Mr. Furnival. I have got your\nletter, and will show it you if you wish it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense; I just said I should be home--\"\n\n\"Of course you just said you would be home, and so we waited; and\nit's not nonsense; and I declare--! Never mind, Martha, don't mind\nme, there's a good creature. I shall get over it soon;\" and then fat,\nsolid, good-humoured Mrs. Furnival burst out into an hysterical fit\nof sobbing. There was a welcome for a man on his return to his home\nafter a day's labour!\n\nMiss Biggs immediately got up and came round behind the drawing-room\ntable to her friend's head. \"Be calm, Mrs. Furnival,\" she said; \"do\nbe calm, and then you will be better soon. Here is the hartshorn.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter, Martha: never mind: leave me alone,\" sobbed the\npoor woman.\n\n\"May I be excused for asking what is really the matter?\" said Mr.\nFurnival, \"for I'll be whipped if I know.\" Miss Biggs looked at him\nas if she thought that he ought to be whipped.\n\n\"I wonder you ever come near the place at all, I do,\" said Mrs.\nFurnival.\n\n\"What place?\" asked Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"This house in which I am obliged to live by myself, without a soul\nto speak to, unless when Martha Biggs comes here.\"\n\n\"Which would be much more frequent, only that I know I am not welcome\nby everybody.\"\n\n\"I know that you hate it. How can I help knowing it?--and you hate\nme too; I know you do;--and I believe you would be glad if you need\nnever come back here at all; I do. Don't, Martha; leave me alone. I\ndon't want all that fuss. There; I can bear it now, whatever it is.\nDo you choose to have your tea, Mr. Furnival? or do you wish to keep\nthe servants waiting out of their beds all night?\"\n\n\"D---- the servants,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"Oh laws!\" exclaimed Miss Biggs, jumping up out of her chair with her\nhands and fingers outstretched, as though never, never in her life\nbefore, had her ears been wounded by such wicked words as those.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival, I am ashamed of you,\" said his wife with gathered\ncalmness of stern reproach.\n\nMr. Furnival was very wrong to swear; doubly wrong to swear before\nhis wife; trebly wrong to swear before a lady visitor; but it must\nbe confessed that there was provocation. That he was at this present\nperiod of his life behaving badly to his wife must be allowed, but on\nthis special evening he had intended to behave well. The woman had\nsought a ground of quarrel against him, and had driven him on till he\nhad forgotten himself in his present after-dinner humour. When a man\nis maintaining a whole household on his own shoulders, and working\nhard to maintain it well, it is not right that he should be brought\nto book because he keeps the servants up half an hour later than\nusual to wash the tea-things. It is very proper that the idle members\nof the establishment should conform to hours, but these hours must\ngive way to his requirements. In those old days of which we have\nspoken so often he might have had his tea at twelve, one, two, or\nthree without a murmur. Though their staff of servants then was\nscanty enough, there was never a difficulty then in supplying any\nsuch want for him. If no other pair of hands could boil the kettle,\nthere was one pair of hands there which no amount of such work on his\nbehalf could tire. But now, because he had come in for his tea at\nten o'clock, he was asked if he intended to keep the servants out of\ntheir beds all night!\n\n\"Oh laws!\" said Miss Biggs, jumping up from her chair as though she\nhad been electrified.\n\nMr. Furnival did not think it consistent with his dignity to keep up\nany dispute in the presence of Miss Biggs, and therefore sat himself\ndown in his accustomed chair without further speech. \"Would you\nwish to have tea now, Mr. Furnival?\" asked his wife again, putting\nconsiderable stress upon the word now.\n\n\"I don't care about it,\" said he.\n\n\"And I am sure I don't at this late hour,\" said Miss Biggs. \"But so\ntired as you are, dear--\"\n\n\"Never mind me, Martha; as for myself, I shall take nothing now.\" And\nthen they all sat without a word for the space of some five minutes.\n\"If you like to go, Martha,\" said Mrs. Furnival, \"don't mind waiting\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" and then Miss Biggs took her bedcandle and left the\nroom. Was it not hard upon her that she should be forced to absent\nherself at this moment, when the excitement of the battle was about\nto begin in earnest? Her footsteps lingered as she slowly retreated\nfrom the drawing-room door, and for one instant she absolutely\npaused, standing still with eager ears. It was but for an instant,\nand then she went on up stairs, out of hearing, and sitting herself\ndown by her bedside allowed the battle to rage in her imagination.\n\nMr. Furnival would have sat there silent till his wife had gone also,\nand so the matter would have terminated for that evening,--had she\nso willed it. But she had been thinking of her miseries; and, having\ncome to some sort of resolution to speak of them openly, what time\ncould she find more appropriate for doing so than the present? \"Tom,\"\nshe said,--and as she spoke there was still a twinkle of the old\nlove in her eye, \"we are not going on together as well as we should\ndo,--not lately. Would it not be well to make a change before it is\ntoo late?\"\n\n\"What change?\" he asked; not exactly in an ill humour, but with a\nhusky, thick voice. He would have preferred now that she should have\nfollowed her friend to bed.\n\n\"I do not want to dictate to you, Tom, but--! Oh Tom, if you knew how\nwretched I am!\"\n\n\"What makes you wretched?\"\n\n\"Because you leave me all alone; because you care more for other\npeople than you do for me; because you never like to be at home,\nnever if you can possibly help it. You know you don't. You are always\naway now upon some excuse or other; you know you are. I don't have\nyou home to dinner not one day in the week through the year. That\ncan't be right, and you know it is not. Oh Tom! you are breaking my\nheart, and deceiving me,--you are. Why did I go down and find that\nwoman in your chamber with you, when you were ashamed to own to me\nthat she was coming to see you? If it had been in the proper way of\nlaw business, you wouldn't have been ashamed. Oh, Tom!\"\n\nThe poor woman had begun her plaint in a manner that was not\naltogether devoid of a discreet eloquence. If only she could have\nmaintained that tone, if she could have confined her words to the\ntale of her own grievances, and have been contented to declare that\nshe was unhappy, only because he was not with her, it might have\nbeen well. She might have touched his heart, or at any rate his\nconscience, and there might have been some enduring result for good.\nBut her feelings had been too many for her, and as her wrongs came to\nher mind, and the words heaped themselves upon her tongue, she could\nnot keep herself from the one subject which she should have left\nuntouched. Mr. Furnival was not the man to bear any interference such\nas this, or to permit the privacy of Lincoln's Inn to be invaded even\nby his wife. His brow grew very black, and his eyes became almost\nbloodshot. The port wine which might have worked him to softness, now\nworked him to anger, and he thus burst forth with words of marital\nvigour:\n\n\"Let me tell you once for ever, Kitty, that I will admit of no\ninterference with what I do, or the people whom I may choose to\nsee in my chambers in Lincoln's Inn. If you are such an infatuated\nsimpleton as to believe--\"\n\n\"Yes; of course I am a simpleton; of course I am a fool; women always\nare.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, will you?\"\n\n\"Listen, yes; it's my business to listen. Would you like that I\nshould give this house up for her, and go into lodgings somewhere? I\nshall have very little objection as matters are going now. Oh dear,\noh dear, that things should ever have come to this!\"\n\n\"Come to what?\"\n\n\"Tom, I could put up with a great deal,--more I think than most\nwomen; I could slave for you like a drudge, and think nothing about\nit. And now that you have got among grand people, I could see you go\nout by yourself without thinking much about that either. I am very\nlonely sometimes,--very; but I could bear that. Nobody has longed to\nsee you rise in the world half so anxious as I have done. But, Tom,\nwhen I know what your goings on are with a nasty, sly, false woman\nlike that, I won't bear it; and there's an end.\" In saying which\nfinal words Mrs. Furnival rose from her seat, and thrice struck her\nhand by no means lightly on the loo table in the middle of the room.\n\n\"I did not think it possible that you should be so silly. I did not\nindeed.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, silly! very well. Women always are silly when they mind\nthat kind of thing. Have you got anything else to say, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes, I have; I have this to say, that I will not endure this sort of\nusage.\"\n\n\"Nor I won't,\" said Mrs. Furnival; \"so you may as well understand it\nat once. As long as there was nothing absolutely wrong, I would put\nup with it for the sake of appearances, and because of Sophia. For\nmyself I don't mind what loneliness I may have to bear. If you had\nbeen called on to go out to the East Indies or even to China, I could\nhave put up with it. But this sort of thing I won't put up with;--nor\nI won't be blind to what I can't help seeing. So now, Mr. Furnival,\nyou may know that I have made up my mind.\" And then, without waiting\nfurther parley, having wisked herself in her energy near to the door,\nshe stalked out, and went up with hurried steps to her own room.\n\nOccurrences of a nature such as this are in all respects unpleasant\nin a household. Let the master be ever so much master, what is he to\ndo? Say that his wife is wrong from the beginning to the end of the\nquarrel,--that in no way improves the matter. His anxiety is that the\nworld abroad shall not know he has ought amiss at home; but she, with\nher hot sense of injury, and her loud revolt against supposed wrongs,\ncares not who hears it. \"Hold your tongue, madam,\" the husband says.\nBut the wife, bound though she be by an oath of obedience, will not\nobey him, but only screams the louder.\n\nAll which, as Mr. Furnival sat there thinking of it, disturbed his\nmind much. That Martha Biggs would spread the tale through all\nBloomsbury and St. Pancras of course he was aware. \"If she drives\nme to it, it must be so,\" he said to himself at last. And then he\nalso betook himself to his rest. And so it was that preparations for\nChristmas were made in Harley Street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nCHRISTMAS AT NONINGSBY.\n\n\nThe house at Noningsby on Christmas-day was quite full, and yet it\nwas by no means a small house. Mrs. Arbuthnot, the judge's married\ndaughter, was there, with her three children; and Mr. Furnival was\nthere, having got over those domestic difficulties in which we lately\nsaw him as best he might; and Lucius Mason was there, having been\nespecially asked by Lady Staveley when she heard that his mother was\nto be at The Cleeve. There could be no more comfortable country-house\nthan Noningsby; and it was, in its own way, pretty, though\nessentially different in all respects from The Cleeve. It was a new\nhouse from the cellar to the ceiling, and as a house was no doubt the\nbetter for being so. All the rooms were of the proper proportion, and\nall the newest appliances for comfort had been attached to it. But\nnevertheless it lacked that something, in appearance rather than in\nfact, which age alone can give to the residence of a gentleman in the\ncountry. The gardens also were new, and the grounds around them trim,\nand square, and orderly. Noningsby was a delightful house; no one\nwith money and taste at command could have created for himself one\nmore delightful; but then there are delights which cannot be created\neven by money and taste.\n\nIt was a pleasant sight to see, the long, broad, well-filled\nbreakfast table, with all that company round it. There were some\neighteen or twenty gathered now at the table, among whom the judge\nsat pre-eminent, looming large in an arm-chair and having a double\nspace allotted to him;--some eighteen or twenty, children included.\nAt the bottom of the table sat Lady Staveley, who still chose to\npreside among her own tea cups as a lady should do; and close to her,\nassisting in the toils of that presidency, sat her daughter Madeline.\nNearest to them were gathered the children, and the rest had formed\nthemselves into little parties, each of which already well knew its\nown place at the board. In how very short a time will come upon one\nthat pleasant custom of sitting in an accustomed place! But here, at\nthese Noningsby breakfasts, among other customs already established,\nthere was one by which Augustus Staveley was always privileged to\nsit by the side of Sophia Furnival. No doubt his original object was\nstill unchanged. A match between that lady and his friend Graham was\nstill desirable, and by perseverance he might pique Felix Graham to\narouse himself. But hitherto Felix Graham had not aroused himself in\nthat direction, and one or two people among the party were inclined\nto mistake young Staveley's intentions.\n\n\"Gus,\" his sister had said to him the night before, \"I declare I\nthink you are going to make love to Sophia Furnival.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" he had replied. \"As a rule I do not think there is any one\nin the world for whose discernment I have so much respect as I have\nfor yours. But in this respect even you are wrong.\"\n\n\"Ah, of course you say so.\"\n\n\"If you won't believe me, ask her. What more can I say?\"\n\n\"I certainly sha'n't ask her, for I don't know her well enough.\"\n\n\"She's a very clever girl; let me tell you that, whoever falls in\nlove with her.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she is, and she is handsome too, very; but for all that she\nis not good enough for our Gus.\"\n\n\"Of course she is not, and therefore I am not thinking of her. And\nnow go to bed and dream that you have got the Queen of the Fortunate\nIslands for your sister-in-law.\"\n\nBut although Staveley was himself perfectly indifferent to all the\ncharms of Miss Furnival, nevertheless he could hardly restrain his\ndislike to Lucius Mason, who, as he thought, was disposed to admire\nthe lady in question. In talking of Lucius to his own family and to\nhis special friend Graham, he had called him conceited, pedantic,\nuncouth, unenglish, and detestable. His own family, that is, his\nmother and sister, rarely contradicted him in anything; but Graham\nwas by no means so cautious, and usually contradicted him in\neverything. Indeed, there was no sign of sterling worth so plainly\nmarked in Staveley's character as the full conviction which he\nentertained of the superiority of his friend Felix.\n\n\"You are quite wrong about him,\" Felix had said. \"He has not been at\nan English school, or English university, and therefore is not like\nother young men that you know; but he is, I think, well educated\nand clever. As for conceit, what man will do any good who is not\nconceited? Nobody holds a good opinion of a man who has a low opinion\nof himself.\"\n\n\"All the same, my dear fellow, I do not like Lucius Mason.\"\n\n\"And some one else, if you remember, did not like Dr. Fell.\"\n\n\"And now, good people, what are you all going to do about church?\"\nsaid Staveley, while they were still engaged with their rolls and\neggs.\n\n\"I shall walk,\" said the judge.\n\n\"And I shall go in the carriage,\" said the judge's wife.\n\n\"That disposes of two; and now it will take half an hour to settle\nfor the rest. Miss. Furnival, you no doubt will accompany my mother.\nAs I shall be among the walkers you will see how much I sacrifice by\nthe suggestion.\"\n\nIt was a mile to the church, and Miss Furnival knew the advantage\nof appearing in her seat unfatigued and without subjection to wind,\nmud, or rain. \"I must confess,\" she said, \"that under all the\ncircumstances, I shall prefer your mother's company to yours;\"\nwhereupon Staveley, in the completion of his arrangements, assigned\nthe other places in the carriage to the married ladies of the\ncompany.\n\n\"But I have taken your sister Madeline's seat in the carriage,\"\nprotested Sophia with great dismay.\n\n\"My sister Madeline generally walks.\"\n\n\"Then of course I shall walk with her;\" but when the time came Miss\nFurnival did go in the carriage whereas Miss Staveley went on foot.\n\nIt so fell out, as they started, that Graham found himself walking at\nMiss Staveley's side, to the great disgust, no doubt, of half a dozen\nother aspirants for that honour. \"I cannot help thinking,\" he said,\nas they stepped briskly over the crisp white frost, \"that this\nChristmas-day of ours is a great mistake.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham!\" she exclaimed\n\n\"You need not regard me with horror,--at least not with any special\nhorror on this occasion.\"\n\n\"But what you say is very horrid.\"\n\n\"That, I flatter myself, seems so only because I have not yet said\nit. That part of our Christmas-day which is made to be in any degree\nsacred is by no means a mistake.\"\n\n\"I am glad you think that.\"\n\n\"Or rather, it is not a mistake in as far as it is in any degree made\nsacred. But the peculiar conviviality of the day is so ponderous! Its\nroast-beefiness oppresses one so thoroughly from the first moment\nof one's waking, to the last ineffectual effort at a bit of fried\npudding for supper!\"\n\n\"But you need not eat fried pudding for supper. Indeed, here, I am\nafraid, you will not have any supper offered you at all.\"\n\n\"No; not to me individually, under that name. I might also manage\nto guard my own self under any such offers. But there is always the\nflavour of the sweetmeat, in the air,--of all the sweetmeats edible\nand non-edible.\"\n\n\"You begrudge the children their snap-dragon. That's what it all\nmeans, Mr. Graham.\"\n\n\"No; I deny it; unpremeditated snap-dragon is dear to my soul; and I\ncould expend myself in blindman's buff.\"\n\n\"You shall then, after dinner; for of course you know that we all\ndine early.\"\n\n\"But blindman's buff at three, with snap-dragon at a quarter to\nfour--charades at five, with wine and sweet cake at half-past six,\nis ponderous. And that's our mistake. The big turkey would be very\ngood;--capital fun to see a turkey twice as big as it ought to\nbe! But the big turkey, and the mountain of beef, and the pudding\nweighing a hundredweight, oppress one's spirits by their combined\ngravity. And then they impart a memory of indigestion, a halo as it\nwere of apoplexy, even to the church services.\"\n\n\"I do not agree with you the least in the world.\"\n\n\"I ask you to answer me fairly. Is not additional eating an ordinary\nEnglishman's ordinary idea of Christmas-day?\"\n\n\"I am only an ordinary Englishwoman and therefore cannot say. It is\nnot my idea.\"\n\n\"I believe that the ceremony, as kept by us, is perpetuated by the\nbutchers and beersellers, with a helping hand from the grocers. It is\nessentially a material festival; and I would not object to it even on\nthat account if it were not so grievously overdone. How the sun is\nmoistening the frost on the ground. As we come back the road will be\nquite wet.\"\n\n\"We shall be going home then and it will not signify. Remember, Mr.\nGraham, I shall expect you to come forward in great strength for\nblindman's buff.\" As he gave her the required promise, he thought\nthat even the sports of Christmas-day would be bearable, if she also\nwere to make one of the sportsmen; and then they entered the church.\n\n[Illustration: Christmas at Noningsby--Morning.]\n\nI do not know of anything more pleasant to the eye than a pretty\ncountry church, decorated for Christmas-day. The effect in a city is\naltogether different. I will not say that churches there should not\nbe decorated, but comparatively it is a matter of indifference. No\none knows who does it. The peculiar munificence of the squire who\nhas sacrificed his holly bushes is not appreciated. The work of the\nfingers that have been employed is not recognised. The efforts made\nfor hanging the pendent wreaths to each capital have been of no\nspecial interest to any large number of the worshippers. It has\nbeen done by contract, probably, and even if well done has none of\nthe grace of association. But here at Noningsby church, the winter\nflowers had been cut by Madeline and the gardener, and the red\nberries had been grouped by her own hands. She and the vicar's wife\nhad stood together with perilous audacity on the top of the clerk's\ndesk while they fixed the branches beneath the cushion of the\nold-fashioned turret, from which the sermons were preached. And\nall this had of course been talked about at the house; and some of\nthe party had gone over to see, including Sophia Furnival, who had\ndeclared that nothing could be so delightful, though she had omitted\nto endanger her fingers by any participation in the work. And the\nchildren had regarded the operation as a triumph of all that was\nwonderful in decoration; and thus many of them had been made happy.\n\nOn their return from church, Miss Furnival insisted on walking,\nin order, as she said, that Miss Staveley might not have all the\nfatigue; but Miss Staveley would walk also, and the carriage, after\na certain amount of expostulation and delay, went off with its load\nincomplete.\n\n\"And now for the plum-pudding part of the arrangement,\" said Felix\nGraham.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Graham,\" said Madeline, \"now for the plum-pudding--and the\nblindman's buff.\"\n\n\"Did you ever see anything more perfect than the church, Mr. Mason?\"\nsaid Sophia.\n\n\"Anything more perfect? no; in that sort of way, perhaps, never. I\nhave seen the choir of Cologne.\"\n\n\"Come, come; that's not fair,\" said Graham. \"Don't import Cologne in\norder to crush us here down in our little English villages. You never\nsaw the choir of Cologne bright with holly berries.\"\n\n\"No; but I have with cardinal's stockings, and bishop's robes.\"\n\n\"I think I should prefer the holly,\" said Miss Furnival. \"And why\nshould not our churches always look like that, only changing the\nflowers and the foliage with the season? It would make the service so\nattractive.\"\n\n\"It would hardly do at Lent,\" said Madeline, in a serious tone.\n\n\"No, perhaps not at Lent exactly.\"\n\nPeregrine and Augustus Staveley were walking on in front, not perhaps\nas well satisfied with the day as the rest of the party. Augustus, on\nleaving the church, had made a little effort to assume his place as\nusual by Miss Furnival's side, but by some accident of war, Mason\nwas there before him. He had not cared to make one of a party of\nthree, and therefore had gone on in advance with young Orme. Nor was\nPeregrine himself much more happy. He did not know why, but he felt\nwithin his breast a growing aversion to Felix Graham. Graham was a\npuppy, he thought, and a fellow that talked too much; and then he\nwas such a confoundedly ugly dog, and--and--and--Peregrine Orme did\nnot like him. He was not a man to analyze his own feelings in such\nmatters. He did not ask himself why he should have been rejoiced to\nhear that instant business had taken Felix Graham off to Hong Kong;\nbut he knew that he would have rejoiced. He knew also that Madeline\nStaveley was--. No; he did not know what she was; but when he was\nalone, he carried on with her all manner of imaginary conversations,\nthough when he was in her company he had hardly a word to say to her.\nUnder these circumstances he fraternized with her brother; but even\nin that he could not receive much satisfaction, seeing that he could\nnot abuse Graham to Graham's special friend, nor could he breathe a\nsigh as to Madeline's perfections into the ear of Madeline's brother.\n\nThe children,--and there were three or four assembled there besides\nthose belonging to Mrs. Arbuthnot, were by no means inclined to agree\nwith Mr. Graham's strictures as to the amusements of Christmas-day.\nTo them it appeared that they could not hurry fast enough into the\nvortex of its dissipations. The dinner was a serious consideration,\nespecially with reference to certain illuminated mince-pies which\nwere the crowning glory of that banquet; but time for these was\nalmost begrudged in order that the fast handkerchief might be tied\nover the eyes of the first blindman.\n\n\"And now we'll go into the schoolroom,\" said Marian Arbuthnot,\njumping up and leading the way. \"Come along, Mr. Felix,\" and Felix\nGraham followed her.\n\nMadeline had declared that Felix Graham should be blinded first, and\nsuch was his doom. \"Now mind you catch me, Mr. Felix; pray do,\" said\nMarian, when she had got him seated in a corner of the room. She was\na beautiful fair little thing, with long, soft curls, and lips red as\na rose, and large, bright blue eyes, all soft and happy and laughing,\nloving the friends of her childhood with passionate love, and fully\nexpecting an equal devotion from them. It is of such children that\nour wives and sweethearts should be made.\n\n\"But how am I to find you when my eyes are blinded?\"\n\n\"Oh, you can feel, you know. You can put your hand on the top of my\nhead. I mustn't speak, you know; but I'm sure I shall laugh; and\nthen you must guess that it's Marian.\" That was her idea of playing\nblindman's buff according to the strict rigour of the game.\n\n\"And you'll give me a big kiss?\" said Felix.\n\n\"Yes, when we've done playing,\" she promised with great seriousness.\n\nAnd then a huge white silk handkerchief, as big as a small sail, was\nbrought down from grandpapa's dressing-room, so that nobody should\nsee the least bit \"in the world,\" as Marian had observed with great\nenergy; and the work of blinding was commenced. \"I ain't big enough\nto reach round,\" said Marian, who had made an effort, but in vain.\n\"You do it, aunt Mad,\" and she tendered the handkerchief to Miss\nStaveley, who, however, did not appear very eager to undertake the\ntask.\n\n\"I'll be the executioner,\" said grandmamma, \"the more especially as\nI shall not take any other share in the ceremony. This shall be the\nchair of doom. Come here, Mr. Graham, and submit yourself to me.\" And\nso the first victim was blinded. \"Mind you remember,\" said Marian,\nwhispering into his ear as he was led away. \"Green spirits and white;\nblue spirits and gray--,\" and then he was twirled round in the room\nand left to commence his search as best he might.\n\nMarian Arbuthnot was not the only soft little laughing darling that\nwished to be caught, and blinded, so that there was great pulling\nat the blindman's tails, and much grasping at his outstretched arms\nbefore the desired object was attained. And he wandered round the\nroom skilfully, as though a thought were in his mind false to his\ntreaty with Marian,--as though he imagined for a moment that some\nother prize might be caught. But if so, the other prize evaded him\ncarefully, and in due progress of play, Marian's soft curls were\nwithin his grasp. \"I'm sure I didn't speak, or say a word,\" said she,\nas she ran up to her grandmother to have the handkerchief put over\nher eyes. \"Did I, grandmamma?\"\n\n\"There are more ways of speaking than one,\" said Lady Staveley. \"You\nand Mr. Graham understand each other, I think.\"\n\n\"Oh, I was caught quite fairly,\" said Marian--\"and now lead me round\nand round.\" To her at any rate the festivities of Christmas-day were\nnot too ponderous for real enjoyment.\n\nAnd then, at last, somebody caught the judge. I rather think it\nwas Madeline; but his time in truth was come, and he had no chance\nof escape. The whole room was set upon his capture, and though he\nbarricaded himself with chairs and children, he was duly apprehended\nand named. \"That's papa; I know by his watch-chain, for I made it.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, my dears,\" said the judge. \"I will do no such thing. I\nshould never catch anybody, and should remain blind for ever.\"\n\n\"But grandpapa must,\" said Marian. \"It's the game that he should be\nblinded when he's caught.\"\n\n\"Suppose the game was that we should be whipped when we are caught,\nand I was to catch you,\" said Augustus.\n\n\"But I would not play that game,\" said Marian.\n\n\"Oh, papa, you must,\" said Madeline. \"Do--and you shall catch Mr.\nFurnival.\"\n\n\"That would be a temptation,\" said the judge. \"I've never been able\nto do that yet, though I've been trying it for some years.\"\n\n\"Justice is blind,\" said Graham. \"Why should a judge be ashamed to\nfollow the example of his own goddess?\" And so at last the owner of\nthe ermine submitted, and the stern magistrate of the bench was led\nround with the due incantation of the spirits, and dismissed into\nchaos to seek for a new victim.\n\n[Illustration: Christmas at Noningsby--Evening.]\n\nOne of the rules of blindman's buff at Noningsby was this, that\nit should not be played by candlelight,--a rule that is in every\nway judicious, as thereby an end is secured for that which might\notherwise be unending. And therefore when it became so dark in the\nschoolroom that there was not much difference between the blind man\nand the others, the handkerchief was smuggled away, and the game was\nat an end.\n\n\"And now for snap-dragon,\" said Marian.\n\n\"Exactly as you predicted, Mr. Graham,\" said Madeline: \"blindman's\nbuff at a quarter past three, and snap-dragon at five.\"\n\n\"I revoke every word that I uttered, for I was never more amused in\nmy life.\"\n\n\"And you will be prepared to endure the wine and sweet cake when they\ncome.\"\n\n\"Prepared to endure anything, and go through everything. We shall be\nallowed candles now, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, by no means. Snap-dragon by candlelight! who ever heard\nof such a thing? It would wash all the dragon out of it, and leave\nnothing but the snap. It is a necessity of the game that it should be\nplayed in the dark,--or rather by its own lurid light.\"\n\n\"Oh, there is a lurid light; is there?\"\n\n\"You shall see;\" and then she turned away to make her preparations.\n\nTo the game of snap-dragon, as played at Noningsby, a ghost was\nalways necessary, and aunt Madeline had played the ghost ever since\nshe had been an aunt, and there had been any necessity for such a\npart. But in previous years the spectators had been fewer in number\nand more closely connected with the family. \"I think we must drop the\nghost on this occasion,\" she said, coming up to her brother.\n\n\"You'll disgust them all dreadfully if you do,\" said he. \"The young\nSebrights have come specially to see the ghost.\"\n\n\"Well, you can do ghost for them.\"\n\n\"I! no; I can't act a ghost. Miss Furnival, you'd make a lovely\nghost.\"\n\n\"I shall be most happy to be useful,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"Oh, aunt Mad, you must be ghost,\" said Marian, following her.\n\n\"You foolish little thing, you; we are going to have a beautiful\nghost--a divine ghost,\" said uncle Gus.\n\n\"But we want Madeline to be the ghost,\" said a big Miss Sebright, ten\nor eleven years old.\n\n\"She's always ghost,\" said Marian.\n\n\"To be sure; it will be much better,\" said Miss Furnival. \"I only\noffered my poor services hoping to be useful. No Banquo that ever\nlived could leave a worse ghost behind him than I should prove.\"\n\nIt ended in there being two ghosts. It had become quite impossible\nto rob Miss Furnival of her promised part, and Madeline could not\nrefuse to solve the difficulty in this way without making more of the\nmatter than it deserved. The idea of two ghosts was delightful to\nthe children, more especially as it entailed two large dishes full\nof raisins, and two blue fires blazing up from burnt brandy. So the\ngirls went out, not without proffered assistance from the gentlemen,\nand after a painfully long interval of some fifteen or twenty\nminutes,--for Miss Furnival's back hair would not come down and\nadjust itself into ghostlike lengths with as much readiness as that\nof her friend,--they returned bearing the dishes before them on large\ntrays. In each of them the spirit was lighted as they entered the\nschoolroom door, and thus, as they walked in, they were illuminated\nby the dark-blue flames which they carried.\n\n\"Oh, is it not grand?\" said Marian, appealing to Felix Graham.\n\n\"Uncommonly grand,\" he replied.\n\n\"And which ghost do you think is the grandest? I'll tell you which\nghost I like the best,--in a secret, you know; I like aunt Mad the\nbest, and I think she's the grandest too.\"\n\n\"And I'll tell you in a secret that I think the same. To my mind she\nis the grandest ghost I ever saw in my life.\"\n\n\"Is she indeed?\" asked Marian, solemnly, thinking probably that her\nnew friend's experience in ghosts must be extensive. However that\nmight be, he thought that as far as his experience in women went, he\nhad never seen anything more lovely than Madeline Staveley dressed in\na long white sheet, with a long bit of white cambric pinned round her\nface.\n\nAnd it may be presumed that the dress altogether is not unbecoming\nwhen accompanied by blue flames, for Augustus Staveley and Lucius\nMason thought the same thing of Miss Furnival, whereas Peregrine Orme\ndid not know whether he was standing on his head or his feet as he\nlooked at Miss Staveley. Miss Furnival may possibly have had some\ninkling of this when she offered to undertake the task, but I protest\nthat such was not the case with Madeline. There was no second thought\nin her mind when she first declined the ghosting, and afterwards\nundertook the part. No wish to look beautiful in the eyes of Felix\nGraham had come to her--at any rate as yet; and as to Peregrine Orme,\nshe had hardly thought of his existence. \"By heavens!\" said Peregrine\nto himself, \"she is the most beautiful creature that I ever saw;\" and\nthen he began to speculate within his own mind how the idea might be\nreceived at The Cleeve.\n\nBut there was no such realised idea with Felix Graham. He saw that\nMadeline Staveley was very beautiful, and he felt in an unconscious\nmanner that her character was very sweet. He may have thought that he\nmight have loved such a girl, had such love been a thing permitted to\nhim. But this was far from being the case. Felix Graham's lot in this\nlife, as regarded that share which his heart might have in it, was\nalready marked out for him;--marked out for himself and by himself.\nThe future wife of his bosom had already been selected, and was now\nin course of preparation for the duties of her future life. He was\none of those few wise men who have determined not to take a partner\nin life at hazard, but to mould a young mind and character to those\npursuits and modes of thought which may best fit a woman for the\nduties she will have to perform. What little it may be necessary to\nknow of the earlier years of Mary Snow shall be told hereafter. Here\nit will be only necessary to say that she was an orphan, that as yet\nshe was little more than a child, and that she owed her maintenance\nand the advantage of her education to the charity and love of her\ndestined husband. Therefore, as I have said, it was manifest that\nFelix Graham could not think of falling in love with Miss Staveley,\neven had not his very low position, in reference to worldly affairs,\nmade any such passion on his part quite hopeless. But with Peregrine\nOrme the matter was different. There could be no possible reason why\nPeregrine Orme should not win and wear the beautiful girl whom he so\nmuch admired.\n\nBut the ghosts are kept standing over their flames, the spirit is\nbecoming exhausted, and the raisins will be burnt. At snap-dragon,\ntoo, the ghosts here had something to do. The law of the game is\nthis--a law on which Marian would have insisted had not the flames\nbeen so very hot--that the raisins shall become the prey of those\naudacious marauders only who dare to face the presence of the ghost,\nand to plunge their hands into the burning dish. As a rule the boys\ndo this, clawing out the raisins, while the girls pick them up and\neat them. But here at Noningsby the boys were too little to act thus\nas pioneers in the face of the enemy, and the raisins might have\nremained till the flames were burnt out, had not the beneficent ghost\nscattered abroad the richness of her own treasures.\n\n\"Now, Marian,\" said Felix Graham, bringing her up in his arms.\n\n\"But it will burn, Mr. Felix. Look there; see; there are a great many\nat that end. You do it.\"\n\n\"I must have another kiss then.\"\n\n\"Very well, yes; if you get five.\" And then Felix dashed his hand in\namong the flames and brought forth a fistful of fruit, which imparted\nto his fingers and wristband a smell of brandy for the rest of the\nevening.\n\n\"If you take so many at a time I shall rap your knuckles with the\nspoon,\" said the ghost, as she stirred up the flames to keep them\nalive.\n\n\"But the ghost shouldn't speak,\" said Marian, who was evidently\nunacquainted with the best ghosts of tragedy.\n\n\"But the ghost must speak when such large hands invade the caldron;\"\nand then another raid was effected, and the threatened blow was\ngiven. Had any one told her in the morning that she would that day\nhave rapped Mr. Graham's knuckles with a kitchen spoon, she would not\nhave believed that person; but it is thus that hearts are lost and\nwon.\n\nAnd Peregrine Orme looked on from a distance, thinking of it all.\nThat he should have been stricken dumb by the beauty of any girl was\nsurprising even to himself; for though young and almost boyish in his\nmanners, he had never yet feared to speak out in any presence. The\ntutor at his college had thought him insolent beyond parallel; and\nhis grandfather, though he loved him for his open face and plain\noutspoken words, found them sometimes almost too much for him. But\nnow he stood there looking and longing, and could not summon courage\nto go up and address a few words to this young girl even in the midst\nof their sports. Twice or thrice during the last few days he had\nessayed to speak to her, but his words had been dull and vapid, and\nto himself they had appeared childish. He was quite conscious of his\nown weakness. More than once, during that period of the snap-dragon,\ndid he say to himself that he would descend into the lists and break\na lance in that tourney; but still he did not descend, and his lance\nremained inglorious in its rest.\n\nAt the other end of the long table the ghost also had two attendant\nknights, and neither of them refrained from the battle. Augustus\nStaveley, if he thought it worth his while to keep the lists at\nall, would not be allowed to ride through them unopposed from any\nbackwardness on the part of his rival. Lucius Mason was not likely\nto become a timid, silent, longing lover. To him it was not possible\nthat he should fear the girl whom he loved. He could not worship that\nwhich he wished to obtain for himself. It may be doubted whether he\nhad much faculty of worshipping anything in the truest meaning of\nthat word. One worships that which one feels, through the inner and\nunexpressed conviction of the mind, to be greater, better, higher\nthan oneself; but it was not probable that Lucius Mason should so\nthink of any woman that he might meet.\n\nNor, to give him his due, was it probable that he should be in any\nway afraid of any man that he might encounter. He would fear neither\nthe talent, nor the rank, nor the money influence, nor the dexterity\nof any such rival. In any attempt that he might make on a woman's\nheart he would regard his own chance as good against that of any\nother possible he. Augustus Staveley was master here at Noningsby,\nand was a clever, dashing, handsome, fashionable young fellow; but\nLucius Mason never dreamed of retreating before such forces as those.\nHe had words with which to speak as fair as those of any man, and\nflattered himself that he as well knew how to use them.\n\nIt was pretty to see with what admirable tact and judicious\nmanagement of her smiles Sophia received the homage of the two young\nmen, answering the compliments of both with ease, and so conducting\nherself that neither could fairly accuse her of undue favour to the\nother. But unfairly, in his own mind, Augustus did so accuse her.\nAnd why should he have been so venomous, seeing that he entertained\nno regard for the lady himself? His object was still plain\nenough,--that, namely, of making a match between his needy friend and\nthe heiress.\n\nHis needy friend in the mean time played on through the long evening\nin thoughtless happiness; and Peregrine Orme, looking at the game\nfrom a distance, saw that rap given to the favoured knuckles with a\nbitterness of heart and an inner groaning of the spirit that will not\nbe incomprehensible to many.\n\n\"I do so love that Mr. Felix!\" said Marian, as her aunt Madeline\nkissed her in her little bed on wishing her good night. \"Don't you,\naunt Mad--?\"\n\nAnd so it was that Christmas-day was passed at Noningsby.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\nCHRISTMAS AT GROBY PARK.\n\n\nChristmas-day was always a time of very great trial to Mrs. Mason of\nGroby Park. It behoved her, as the wife of an old English country\ngentleman, to spread her board plenteously at that season, and in\nsome sort to make an open house of it. But she could not bring\nherself to spread any board with plenty, and the idea of an open\nhouse would almost break her heart. Unlimited eating! There was\nsomething in the very sounds of such words which was appalling to the\ninner woman.\n\nAnd on this Christmas-day she was doomed to go through an ordeal of\nvery peculiar severity. It so happened that the cure of souls in the\nparish of Groby had been intrusted for the last two or three years to\na young, energetic, but not very opulent curate. Why the rector of\nGroby should be altogether absent, leaving the work in the hands\nof a curate, whom he paid by the lease of a cottage and garden and\nfifty-five pounds a year,--thereby behaving as he imagined with\nextensive liberality,--it is unnecessary here to inquire. Such was\nthe case, and the Rev. Adolphus Green, with Mrs. A. Green and the\nfour children, managed to live with some difficulty on the produce\nof the garden and the allotted stipend; but could not probably have\nlived at all in that position had not Mrs. Adolphus Green been\nblessed with some small fortune.\n\nIt had so happened that Mrs. Adolphus Green had been instrumental in\nimparting some knowledge of singing to two of the Miss Masons, and\nhad continued her instructions over the last three years. This had\nnot been done in any preconcerted way, but the lessons had grown by\nchance. Mrs. Mason the while had looked on with a satisfied eye at an\narrangement that was so much to her taste.\n\n\"There are no regular lessons you know,\" she had said to her husband,\nwhen he suggested that some reward for so much work would be\nexpedient. \"Mrs. Green finds it convenient to have the use of my\ndrawing-room, and would never see an instrument from year's end to\nyear's end if she were not allowed to come up here. Depend upon it\nshe gets a great deal more than she gives.\"\n\nBut after two years of tuition Mr. Mason had spoken a second time.\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"I cannot allow the girls to accept so great a\nfavour from Mrs. Green without making her some compensation.\"\n\n\"I don't see that it is at all necessary,\" Mrs. Mason had\nanswered; \"but if you think so, we could send her down a hamper of\napples,--that is, a basketful.\" Now it happened that apples were very\nplentiful that year, and that the curate and his wife were blessed\nwith as many as they could judiciously consume.\n\n\"Apples! nonsense!\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"If you mean money, my dear, I couldn't do it. I wouldn't so offend a\nlady for all the world.\"\n\n\"You could buy them something handsome, in the way of furniture. That\nlittle room of theirs that they call the drawing-room has nothing in\nit at all. Get Jones from Leeds to send them some things that will\ndo for them.\" And hence, after many inner misgivings, had arisen\nthat purchase of a drawing-room set from Mr. Kantwise,--that set of\nmetallic \"Louey Catorse furniture,\" containing three tables, eight\nchairs, &c., &c., as to which it may be remembered that Mrs. Mason\nmade such an undoubted bargain, getting them for less than cost\nprice. That they had been \"strained,\" as Mr. Kantwise himself\nadmitted in discoursing on the subject to Mr. Dockwrath, was not\nmatter of much moment. They would do extremely well for a curate's\nwife.\n\nAnd now on this Christmas-day the present was to be made over to the\nhappy lady. Mr. and Mrs. Green were to dine at Groby Park,--leaving\ntheir more fortunate children to the fuller festivities of the\ncottage; and the intention was that before dinner the whole\ndrawing-room set should be made over. It was with grievous pangs of\nheart that Mrs. Mason looked forward to such an operation. Her own\nhouse was plenteously furnished from the kitchens to the attics,\nbut still she would have loved to keep that metallic set of painted\ntrumpery. She knew that the table would not screw on; she knew that\nthe pivot of the music stool was bent; she knew that there was no\nplace in the house in which they could stand; she must have known\nthat in no possible way could they be of use to her or hers,--and\nyet she could not part with them without an agony. Her husband was\ninfatuated in this matter of compensation for the use of Mrs. Green's\nidle hours; no compensation could be necessary;--and then she paid\nanother visit to the metallic furniture. She knew in her heart of\nhearts that they could never be of use to anybody, and yet she made\nup her mind to keep back two out of the eight chairs. Six chairs\nwould be quite enough for Mrs. Green's small room.\n\nAs there was to be feasting at five, real roast beef, plum-pudding\nand mince-pies;--\"Mince-pies and plum-pudding together are vulgar,\nmy dear,\" Mrs. Mason had said to her husband; but in spite of the\nvulgarity he had insisted;--the breakfast was of course scanty. Mr.\nMason liked a slice of cold meat in the morning, or the leg of a\nfowl, or a couple of fresh eggs as well as any man; but the matter\nwas not worth a continual fight. \"As we are to dine an hour earlier\nto-day I did not think you would eat meat,\" his wife said to him.\n\"Then there would be less expense in putting it on the table,\" he\nhad answered; and after that there was nothing more said about it.\nHe always put off till some future day that great contest which he\nintended to wage and to win, and by which he hoped to bring it about\nthat plenty should henceforward be the law of the land at Groby Park.\nAnd then they all went to church. Mrs. Mason would not on any account\nhave missed church on Christmas-day or a Sunday. It was a cheap duty,\nand therefore rigidly performed. As she walked from her carriage up\nto the church-door she encountered Mrs. Green, and smiled sweetly as\nshe wished that lady all the compliments of the season.\n\n\"We shall see you immediately after church,\" said Mrs. Mason.\n\n\"Oh yes, certainly,\" said Mrs. Green.\n\n\"And Mr. Green with you?\"\n\n\"He intends to do himself the pleasure,\" said the curate's wife.\n\n\"Mind he comes, because we have a little ceremony to go through\nbefore we sit down to dinner,\" and Mrs. Mason smiled again ever\nso graciously. Did she think, or did she not think, that she was\ngoing to do a kindness to her neighbour? Most women would have sunk\ninto their shoes as the hour grew nigh at which they were to show\nthemselves guilty of so much meanness.\n\nShe stayed for the sacrament, and it may here be remarked that on\nthat afternoon she rated both the footman and housemaid because they\nomitted to do so. She thought, we must presume, that she was doing\nher duty, and must imagine her to have been ignorant that she was\ncheating her husband and cheating her friend. She took the sacrament\nwith admirable propriety of demeanour, and then, on her return home,\nwithdrew another chair from the set. There would still be six,\nincluding the rocking chair, and six would be quite enough for that\nlittle hole of a room.\n\nThere was a large chamber up stairs at Groby Park which had been used\nfor the children's lessons, but which now was generally deserted.\nThere was in it an old worn-out pianoforte,--and though Mrs. Mason\nhad talked somewhat grandly of the use of her drawing-room, it was\nhere that the singing had been taught. Into this room the metallic\nfurniture had been brought, and up to that Christmas morning it had\nremained here packed in its original boxes. Hither immediately after\nbreakfast Mrs. Mason had taken herself, and had spent an hour in her\nefforts to set the things forth to view. Two of the chairs she then\nput aside into a cupboard, and a third she added to her private store\non her return to her work after church.\n\nBut, alas, alas! let her do what she would, she could not get the top\non to the table. \"It's all smashed, ma'am,\" said the girl whom she\nat last summoned to her aid. \"Nonsense, you simpleton; how can it be\nsmashed when it's new,\" said the mistress. And then she tried again,\nand again, declaring as she did do, that she would have the law of\nthe rogue who had sold her a damaged article. Nevertheless she had\nknown that it was damaged, and had bought it cheap on that account,\ninsisting in very urgent language that the table was in fact worth\nnothing because of its injuries.\n\nAt about four Mr. and Mrs. Green walked up to the house and were\nshown into the drawing-room. Here was Mrs. Mason supported by\nPenelope and Creusa. As Diana was not musical, and therefore under\nno compliment to Mrs. Green, she kept out of the way. Mr. Mason also\nwas absent. He knew that something very mean was about to be done,\nand would not show his face till it was over. He ought to have taken\nthe matter in hand himself, and would have done so had not his mind\nbeen full of other things. He himself was a man terribly wronged and\nwickedly injured, and could not therefore in these present months\ninterfere much in the active doing of kindnesses. His hours were\nspent in thinking how he might best obtain justice,--how he might\nsecure his pound of flesh. He only wanted his own, but that he\nwould have;--his own, with due punishment on those who had for so\nmany years robbed him of it. He therefore did not attend at the\npresentation of the furniture.\n\n\"And now we'll go up stairs, if you please,\" said Mrs. Mason, with\nthat gracious smile for which she was so famous. \"Mr. Green, you must\ncome too. Dear Mrs. Green has been so very kind to my two girls; and\nnow I have got a few articles,--they are of the very newest fashion,\nand I do hope that Mrs. Green will like them.\" And so they all went\nup into the schoolroom.\n\n\"There's a new fashion come up lately,\" said Mrs. Mason as she walked\nalong the corridor, \"quite new:--of metallic furniture. I don't know\nwhether you have seen any.\" Mrs. Green said she had not seen any as\nyet.\n\n\"The Patent Steel Furniture Company makes it, and it has got very\ngreatly into vogue for small rooms. I thought that perhaps you would\nallow me to present you with a set for your drawing-room.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it is very kind of you to think of it,\" said Mrs. Green.\n\n\"Uncommonly so,\" said Mr. Green. But both Mr. Green and Mrs. Green\nknew the lady, and their hopes did not run high.\n\nAnd then the door was opened and there stood the furniture to view.\nThere stood the furniture, except the three subtracted chairs, and\nthe loo table. The claw and leg of the table indeed were standing\nthere, but the top was folded up and lying on the floor beside it. \"I\nhope you'll like the pattern,\" began Mrs. Mason. \"I'm told that it\nis the prettiest that has yet been brought out. There has been some\nlittle accident about the screw of the table, but the smith in the\nvillage will put that to rights in five minutes. He lives so close to\nyou that I didn't think it worth while to have him up here.\"\n\n\"It's very nice,\" said Mrs. Green, looking round her almost in\ndismay.\n\n\"Very nice indeed,\" said Mr. Green, wondering in his mind for\nwhat purpose such utter trash could have been manufactured, and\nendeavouring to make up his mind as to what they might possibly do\nwith it. Mr. Green knew what chairs and tables should be, and was\nwell aware that the things before him were absolutely useless for any\nof the ordinary purposes of furniture.\n\n\"And they are the most convenient things in the world,\" said Mrs.\nMason, \"for when you are going to change house you pack them all up\nagain in those boxes. Wooden furniture takes up so much room, and is\nso lumbersome.\"\n\n\"Yes, it is,\" said Mrs. Green.\n\n\"I'll have them all put up again and sent down in the cart\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"Thank you; that will be very kind,\" said Mr. Green, and then the\nceremony of the presentation was over. On the following day the boxes\nwere sent down, and Mrs. Mason might have abstracted even another\nchair without detection, for the cases lay unheeded from month to\nmonth in the curate's still unfurnished room. \"The fact is they\ncannot afford a carpet,\" Mrs. Mason afterwards said to one of her\ndaughters, \"and with such things as those they are quite right to\nkeep them up till they can be used with advantage. I always gave Mrs.\nGreen credit for a good deal of prudence.\"\n\nAnd then, when the show was over, they descended again into the\ndrawing-room,--Mr. Green and Mrs. Mason went first, and Creusa\nfollowed. Penelope was thus so far behind as to be able to speak to\nher friend without being heard by the others.\n\n\"You know mamma,\" she said, with a shrug of her shoulders and a look\nof scorn in her eye.\n\n\"The things are very nice.\"\n\n\"No, they are not, and you know they are not. They are worthless;\nperfectly worthless.\"\n\n\"But we don't want anything.\"\n\n\"No; and if there had been no pretence of a gift it would all have\nbeen very well. What will Mr. Green think?\"\n\n\"I rather think he likes iron chairs;\" and then they were in the\ndrawing-room.\n\nMr. Mason did not appear till dinner-time, and came in only just in\ntime to give his arm to Mrs. Green. He had had letters to write,--a\nletter to Messrs. Round and Crook, very determined in its tone; and a\nletter also to Mr. Dockwrath, for the little attorney had so crept on\nin the affair that he was now corresponding with the principal. \"I'll\nteach those fellows in Bedford Row to know who I am,\" he had said to\nhimself more than once, sitting on his high stool at Hamworth.\n\nAnd then came the Groby Park Christmas dinner. To speak the truth Mr.\nMason had himself gone to the neighbouring butcher, and ordered the\nsurloin of beef, knowing that it would be useless to trust to orders\nconveyed through his wife. He had seen the piece of meat put on\none side for him, and had afterwards traced it on to the kitchen\ndresser. But nevertheless when it appeared at table it had been\nsadly mutilated. A steak had been cut off the full breadth of it--a\nmonstrous cantle from out its fair proportions. The lady had seen the\njovial, thick, ample size of the goodly joint, and her heart had been\nunable to spare it. She had made an effort and turned away, saying to\nherself that the responsibility was all with him. But it was of no\nuse. There was that within her which could not do it. \"Your master\nwill never be able to carve such a mountain of meat as that,\" she had\nsaid, turning back to the cook. \"Deed, an' it's he that will, ma'am,\"\nsaid the Irish mistress of the spit; for Irish cooks are cheaper than\nthose bred and born in England. But nevertheless the thing was done,\nand it was by her own fair hands that the envious knife was used. \"I\ncouldn't do it, ma'am,\" the cook had said; \"I couldn't railly.\"\n\nMr. Mason's face became very black when he saw the raid that had been\neffected, and when he looked up across the table his wife's eye was\non him. She knew what she had to expect, and she knew also that it\nwould not come now. Her eye steadily looked at his, quivering with\nfear; for Mr. Mason could be savage enough in his anger. And what had\nshe gained? One may as well ask what does the miser gain who hides\naway his gold in an old pot, or what does that other madman gain\nwho is locked up for long long years because he fancies himself the\ngrandmother of the Queen of England?\n\nBut there was still enough beef on the table for all of them to\neat, and as Mrs. Mason was not intrusted with the carving of it,\ntheir plates were filled. As far as a sufficiency of beef can make\na good dinner Mr. and Mrs. Green did have a good dinner on that\nChristmas-day. Beyond that their comfort was limited, for no one was\nin a humour for happy conversation.\n\nAnd over and beyond the beef there was a plum-pudding and three\nmince-pies. Four mince-pies had originally graced the dish, but\nbefore dinner one had been conveyed away to some up stairs receptacle\nfor such spoils. The pudding also was small, nor was it black and\nrich, and laden with good things as a Christmas pudding should be\nladen. Let us hope that what the guests so lost was made up to them\non the following day, by an absence of those ill effects which\nsometimes attend upon the consumption of rich viands.\n\n\"And now, my dear, we'll have a bit of bread and cheese and a glass\nof beer,\" Mr. Green said when he arrived at his own cottage. And so\nit was that Christmas-day was passed at Groby Park.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\nCHRISTMAS IN GREAT ST. HELENS.\n\n\nWe will now look in for a moment at the Christmas doings of our fat\nfriend, Mr. Moulder. Mr. Moulder was a married man living in lodgings\nover a wine-merchant's vaults in Great St. Helens. He was blessed--or\ntroubled, with no children, and prided himself greatly on the\nmaterial comfort with which his humble home was surrounded. \"His\nwife,\" he often boasted, \"never wanted for plenty of the best of\neating; and for linen and silks and such-like, she could show her\ndrawers and her wardrobes with many a great lady from Russell Square,\nand not be ashamed, neither!\" And then, as for drink,--\"tipple,\" as\nMr. Moulder sportively was accustomed to name it among his friends,\nhe opined that he was not altogether behind the mark in that respect.\n\"He had got some brandy--he didn't care what anybody might say about\nCognac and eau de vie; but the brandy which he had got from Betts'\nprivate establishment seventeen years ago, for richness of flavour\nand fullness of strength, would beat any French article that anybody\nin the city could show. That at least was his idea. If anybody didn't\nlike it, they needn't take it. There was whisky that would make your\nhair stand on end.\" So said Mr. Moulder, and I can believe him; for\nit has made my hair stand on end merely to see other people drinking\nit.\n\nAnd if comforts of apparel, comforts of eating and drinking, and\ncomforts of the feather-bed and easy-chair kind can make a woman\nhappy, Mrs. Moulder was no doubt a happy woman. She had quite fallen\nin to the mode of life laid out for her. She had a little bit of hot\nkidney for breakfast at about ten; she dined at three, having seen\nherself to the accurate cooking of her roast fowl, or her bit of\nsweetbread, and always had her pint of Scotch ale. She turned over\nall her clothes almost every day. In the evening she read Reynolds's\nMiscellany, had her tea and buttered muffins, took a thimbleful of\nbrandy and water at nine, and then went to bed. The work of her\nlife consisted in sewing buttons on to Moulder's shirts, and seeing\nthat his things were properly got up when he was at home. No doubt\nshe would have done better as to the duties of the world, had the\nworld's duties come to her. As it was, very few such had come in her\ndirection. Her husband was away from home three-fourths of the year,\nand she had no children that required attention. As for society, some\nfour or five times a year she would drink tea with Mrs. Hubbles at\nClapham. Mrs. Hubbles was the wife of the senior partner in the firm,\nand on such occasions Mrs. Moulder dressed herself in her best, and\nhaving travelled to Clapham in an omnibus, spent the evening in dull\npropriety on one corner of Mrs. Hubbles's sofa. When I have added to\nthis that Moulder every year took her to Broadstairs for a fortnight,\nI think that I have described with sufficient accuracy the course of\nMrs. Moulder's life.\n\nOn the occasion of this present Christmas-day Mr. Moulder entertained\na small party. And he delighted in such occasional entertainments,\ntaking extraordinary pains that the eatables should be of the\nvery best; and he would maintain an hospitable good humour to the\nlast,--unless anything went wrong in the cookery, in which case he\ncould make himself extremely unpleasant to Mrs. M. Indeed, proper\ncooking for Mr. M. and the proper starching of the bands of his\nshirts were almost the only trials that Mrs. Moulder was doomed to\nsuffer. \"What the d---- are you for?\" he would say, almost throwing\nthe displeasing viands at her head across the table, or tearing the\nrough linen from off his throat. \"It ain't much I ask of you in\nreturn for your keep;\" and then he would scowl at her with bloodshot\neyes till she shook in her shoes. But this did not happen often, as\nexperiences had made her careful.\n\nBut on this present Christmas festival all went swimmingly to the\nend. \"Now, bear a hand, old girl,\" was the harshest word he said\nto her; and he enjoyed himself like Duncan, shut up in measureless\ncontent. He had three guests with him on this auspicious day. There\nwas his old friend Snengkeld, who had dined with him on every\nChristmas since his marriage; there was his wife's brother, of whom\nwe will say a word or two just now;--and there was our old friend,\nMr. Kantwise. Mr. Kantwise was not exactly the man whom Moulder would\nhave chosen as his guest, for they were opposed to each other in\nall their modes of thought and action; but he had come across the\ntravelling agent of the Patent Metallic Steel Furniture Company on\nthe previous day, and finding that he was to be alone in London on\nthis general holiday, he had asked him out of sheer good nature.\nMoulder could be very good natured, and full of pity when the sorrow\nto be pitied arose from some such source as the want of a Christmas\ndinner. So Mr. Kantwise had been asked, and precisely at four o'clock\nhe made his appearance at Great St. Helens.\n\nBut now, as to this brother-in-law. He was no other than that John\nKenneby whom Miriam Usbech did not marry,--whom Miriam Usbech might,\nperhaps, have done well to marry. John Kenneby, after one or two\nattempts in other spheres of life, had at last got into the house\nof Hubbles and Grease, and had risen to be their book-keeper. He\nhad once been tried by them as a traveller, but in that line he had\nfailed. He did not possess that rough, ready, self-confident tone\nof mind which is almost necessary for a man who is destined to move\nabout quickly from one circle of persons to another. After a six\nmonths' trial he had given that up, but during the time, Mr. Moulder,\nthe senior traveller of the house, had married his sister. John\nKenneby was a good, honest, painstaking fellow, and was believed\nby his friends to have put a few pounds together in spite of the\ntimidity of his character.\n\nWhen Snengkeld and Kenneby were shown up into the room, they found\nnobody there but Kantwise. That Mrs. Moulder should be down stairs\nlooking after the roast turkey was no more than natural; but why\nshould not Moulder himself be there to receive his guests? He soon\nappeared, however, coming up without his coat.\n\n\"Well, Snengkeld, how are you, old fellow; many happy returns, and\nall that; the same to you, John. I'll tell you what, my lads; it's a\nprime 'un. I never saw such a bird in all my days.\"\n\n\"What, the turkey?\" said Snengkeld.\n\n\"You didn't think it'd be a ostrich, did you?\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Snengkeld. \"No, I didn't expect nothing but a\nturkey here on Christmas-day.\"\n\n\"And nothing but a turkey you'll have, my boys. Can you eat turkey,\nKantwise?\"\n\nMr. Kantwise declared that his only passion in the way of eating was\nfor a turkey.\n\n\"As for John, I'm sure of him. I've seen him at the work before.\"\nWhereupon John grinned but said nothing.\n\n\"I never see such a bird in my life, certainly.\"\n\n\"From Norfolk, I suppose,\" said Snengkeld, with a great appearance of\ninterest.\n\n\"Oh, you may swear to that. It weighed twenty-four pounds, for I put\nit into the scales myself, and old Gibbetts let me have it for a\nguinea. The price marked on it was five-and-twenty, for I saw it.\nHe's had it hanging for a fortnight, and I've been to see it wiped\ndown with vinegar regular every morning. And now, my boys, it's done\nto a turn. I've been in the kitchen most of the time myself; and\neither I or Mrs. M. has never left it for a single moment.\"\n\n\"How did you manage about divine service?\" said Kantwise; and then,\nwhen he had spoken, closed his eyes and sucked his lips.\n\nMr. Moulder looked at him for a minute, and then said, \"Gammon.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Snengkeld. And then Mrs. Moulder appeared,\nbringing the turkey with her; for she would trust it to no hands less\ncareful than her own.\n\n\"By George, it is a bird,\" said Snengkeld, standing over it and\neyeing it minutely.\n\n\"Uncommon nice it looks,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"All the same, I wouldn't eat none, if I were you,\" said Moulder,\n\"seeing what sinners have been a basting it.\" And then they all sat\ndown to dinner, Moulder having first resumed his coat.\n\nFor the next three or four minutes Moulder did not speak a word. The\nturkey was on his mind, with the stuffing, the gravy, the liver, the\nbreast, the wings, and the legs. He stood up to carve it, and while\nhe was at the work he looked at it as though his two eyes were hardly\nsufficient. He did not help first one person and then another, so\nending by himself; but he cut up artistically as much as might\nprobably be consumed, and located the fragments in small heaps or\nshares in the hot gravy; and then, having made a partition of the\nspoils, he served it out with unerring impartiality. To have robbed\nany one of his or her fair slice of the breast would, in his mind,\nhave been gross dishonesty. In his heart he did not love Kantwise,\nbut he dealt by him with the utmost justice in the great affair of\nthe turkey's breast. When he had done all this, and his own plate was\nladen, he gave a long sigh. \"I shall never cut up such another bird\nas that, the longest day that I have to live,\" he said; and then he\ntook out his large red silk handkerchief and wiped the perspiration\nfrom his brow.\n\n\"Deary me, M.; don't think of that now,\" said the wife.\n\n\"What's the use?\" said Snengkeld. \"Care killed a cat.\"\n\n\"And perhaps you may,\" said John Kenneby, trying to comfort him; \"who\nknows?\"\n\n\"It's all in the hands of Providence,\" said Kantwise, \"and we should\nlook to him.\"\n\n\"And how does it taste?\" asked Moulder, shaking the gloomy thoughts\nfrom his mind.\n\n\"Uncommon,\" said Snengkeld, with his mouth quite full. \"I never eat\nsuch a turkey in all my life.\"\n\n\"Like melted diamonds,\" said Mrs. Moulder, who was not without a\ntouch of poetry.\n\n\"Ah, there's nothing like hanging of 'em long enough, and watching of\n'em well. It's that vinegar as done it;\" and then they went seriously\nto work, and there was nothing more said of any importance until the\neating was nearly over.\n\nAnd now Mrs. M. had taken away the cloth, and they were sitting\ncozily over their port wine. The very apple of the eye of the evening\nhad not arrived even yet. That would not come till the pipes were\nbrought out, and the brandy was put on the table, and the whisky was\nthere that made the people's hair stand on end. It was then that the\nfloodgates of convivial eloquence would be unloosed. In the mean time\nit was necessary to sacrifice something to gentility, and therefore\nthey sat over their port wine.\n\n\"Did you bring that letter with you, John?\" said his sister. John\nreplied that he had done so, and that he had also received another\nletter that morning from another party on the same subject.\n\n\"Do show it to Moulder, and ask him,\" said Mrs. M.\n\n\"I've got 'em both on purpose,\" said John; and then he brought\nforth two letters, and handed one of them to his brother-in-law.\nIt contained a request, very civilly worded, from Messrs. Round\nand Crook, begging him to call at their office in Bedford Row on\nthe earliest possible day, in order that they might have some\nconversation with him regarding the will of the late Sir Joseph\nMason, who died in 18--.\n\n\"Why, this is law business,\" said Moulder, who liked no business\nof that description. \"Don't you go near them, John, if you ain't\nobliged.\"\n\nAnd then Kenneby gave his explanation on the matter, telling how in\nformer years,--many years ago, he had been a witness in a lawsuit.\nAnd then as he told it he sighed, remembering Miriam Usbech, for\nwhose sake he had remained unmarried even to this day. And he went\non to narrate how he had been bullied in the court, though he had\nvaliantly striven to tell the truth with exactness; and as he spoke,\nan opinion of his became manifest that old Usbech had not signed\nthe document in his presence. \"The girl signed it certainly,\" said\nhe, \"for I handed her the pen. I recollect it, as though it were\nyesterday.\"\n\n\"They are the very people we were talking of at Leeds,\" said Moulder,\nturning to Kantwise. \"Mason and Martock; don't you remember how you\nwent out to Groby Park to sell some of them iron gimcracks? That was\nold Mason's son. They are the same people.\"\n\n\"Ah, I shouldn't wonder,\" said Kantwise, who was listening all the\nwhile. He never allowed intelligence of this kind to pass by him\nidly.\n\n\"And who's the other letter from?\" asked Moulder. \"But, dash my wigs,\nit's past six o'clock. Come, old girl, why don't you give us the\ntobacco and stuff?\"\n\n\"It ain't far to fetch,\" said Mrs. Moulder. And then she put the\ntobacco and \"stuff\" upon the table.\n\n\"The other letter is from an enemy of mine,\" said John Kenneby,\nspeaking very solemnly; \"an enemy of mine, named Dockwrath, who lives\nat Hamworth. He's an attorney too.\"\n\n\"Dockwrath!\" said Moulder.\n\nMr. Kantwise said nothing, but he looked round over his shoulder at\nKenneby, and then shut his eyes.\n\n\"That was the name of the man whom we left in the commercial room at\nthe Bull,\" said Snengkeld.\n\n\"He went out to Mason's at Groby Park that same day,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Then it's the same man,\" said Kenneby; and there was as much\nsolemnity in the tone of his voice as though the unravelment of\nall the mysteries of the iron mask was now about to take place. Mr.\nKantwise still said nothing, but he also perceived that it was the\nsame man.\n\n\"Let me tell you, John Kenneby,\" said Moulder, with the air of one\nwho understood well the subject that he was discussing, \"if they two\nbe the same man, then the man who wrote that letter to you is as big\na blackguard as there is from this to hisself.\" And Mr. Moulder in\nthe excitement of the moment puffed hard at his pipe, took a long\npull at his drink, and dragged open his waistcoat. \"I don't know\nwhether Kantwise has anything to say upon that subject,\" added\nMoulder.\n\n\"Not a word at present,\" said Kantwise. Mr. Kantwise was a very\ncareful man, and usually calculated with accuracy the value which he\nmight extract from any circumstances with reference to his own main\nchance. Mr. Dockwrath had not as yet paid him for the set of metallic\nfurniture, and therefore he also might well have joined in that\nsweeping accusation; but it might be that by a judicious use of what\nhe now heard he might obtain the payment of that little bill,--and\nperhaps other collateral advantages.\n\nAnd then the letter from Dockwrath to Kenneby was brought forth and\nread. \"My dear John,\" it began,--for the two had known each other\nwhen they were lads together,--and it went on to request Kenneby's\nattendance at Hamworth for the short space of a few hours,--\"I want\nto have a little conversation with you about a matter of considerable\ninterest to both of us; and as I cannot expect you to undertake\nexpense I enclose a money order for thirty shillings.\"\n\n\"He's in earnest at any rate,\" said Mr. Moulder.\n\n\"No mistake about that,\" said Snengkeld.\n\nBut Mr. Kantwise spoke never a word.\n\nIt was at last decided that John Kenneby should go both to Hamworth\nand to Bedford Row, but that he should go to Hamworth first. Moulder\nwould have counselled him to have gone to neither, but Snengkeld\nremarked that there were too many at work to let the matter sleep,\nand John himself observed that \"anyways he hadn't done anything to be\nashamed of.\"\n\n\"Then go,\" said Moulder at last, \"only don't say more than you are\nobliged to.\"\n\n\"I does not like these business talkings on Christmas night,\" said\nMrs. Moulder, when the matter was arranged.\n\n\"What can one do?\" asked Moulder.\n\n\"It's a tempting of Providence in my mind,\" said Kantwise, as he\nreplenished his glass, and turned his eyes up to the ceiling.\n\n\"Now that's gammon,\" said Moulder. And then there arose among them a\nlong and animated discussion on matters theological.\n\n\"I'll tell you what my idea of death is,\" said Moulder, after a\nwhile. \"I ain't a bit afeard of it. My father was an honest man as\ndid his duty by his employers, and he died with a bottom of brandy\nbefore him and a pipe in his mouth. I sha'n't live long myself--\"\n\n\"Gracious, Moulder, don't!\" said Mrs. M.\n\n\"No, more I sha'n't, 'cause I'm fat as he was; and I hope I may die\nas he did. I've been honest to Hubbles and Grease. They've made\nthousands of pounds along of me, and have never lost none. Who can\nsay more than that? When I took to the old girl there, I insured my\nlife, so that she shouldn't want her wittles and drink--\"\n\n\"Oh, M., don't!\"\n\n\"And I ain't afeard to die. Snengkeld, my old pal, hand us the\nbrandy.\"\n\nSuch is the modern philosophy of the Moulders, pigs out of the sty\nof Epicurus. And so it was they passed Christmas-day in Great St.\nHelens.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\nMR. FURNIVAL AGAIN AT HIS CHAMBERS.\n\n\nThe Christmas doings at The Cleeve were not very gay. There was no\nvisitor there, except Lady Mason, and it was known that she was\nin trouble. It must not, however, be supposed that she constantly\nbewailed herself while there, or made her friends miserable by a\nsuccession of hysterical tears. By no means. She made an effort to be\nserene, and the effort was successful--as such efforts usually are.\nOn the morning of Christmas-day they duly attended church, and Lady\nMason was seen by all Hamworth sitting in The Cleeve pew. In no way\ncould the baronet's friendship have been shown more plainly than\nin this, nor could a more significant mark of intimacy have been\ngiven;--all which Sir Peregrine well understood. The people of\nHamworth had chosen to talk scandal about Lady Mason, but he at any\nrate would show how little attention he paid to the falsehoods that\nthere were circulated. So he stood by her at the pew door as she\nentered, with as much deference as though she had been a duchess; and\nthe people of Hamworth, looking on, wondered which would be right,\nMr. Dockwrath or Sir Peregrine.\n\nAfter dinner Sir Peregrine gave a toast. \"Lady Mason, we will drink\nthe health of the absent boys. God bless them! I hope they are\nenjoying themselves.\"\n\n\"God bless them!\" said Mrs. Orme, putting her handkerchief to her\neyes.\n\n\"God bless them both!\" said Lady Mason, also putting her handkerchief\nto her eyes. Then the ladies left the room, and that was the extent\nof their special festivity. \"Robert,\" said Sir Peregrine immediately\nafterwards to his butler, \"let them have what port wine they want in\nthe servants' hall--within measure.\"\n\n\"Yes, Sir Peregrine.\"\n\n\"And Robert, I shall not want you again.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir Peregrine.\"\n\nFrom all which it may be imagined that the Christmas doings at The\nCleeve were chiefly maintained below stairs.\n\n\"I do hope they are happy,\" said Mrs. Orme, when the two ladies\nwere together in the drawing-room. \"They have a very nice party at\nNoningsby.\"\n\n\"Your boy will be happy, I'm sure,\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"And why not Lucius also?\"\n\nIt was sweet in Lady Mason's ear to hear her son called by his\nChristian name. All these increasing signs of interest and intimacy\nwere sweet, but especially any which signified some favour shown to\nher son. \"This trouble weighs heavy on him,\" she replied. \"It is only\nnatural that he should feel it.\"\n\n\"Papa does not seem to think much of it,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"If I were\nyou, I would strive to forget it.\"\n\n\"I do strive,\" said the other; and then she took the hand which Mrs.\nOrme had stretched out to her, and that lady got up and kissed her.\n\n\"Dearest friend,\" said Mrs. Orme, \"if we can comfort you we will.\"\nAnd then they sobbed in each other's arms.\n\nIn the mean time Sir Peregrine was sitting alone, thinking. He sat\nthinking, with his glass of claret untouched by his side, and with\nthe biscuit which he had taken lying untouched upon the table. As he\nsat he had raised one leg upon the other, placing his foot on his\nknee, and he held it there with his hand upon his instep. And so he\nsat without moving for some quarter of an hour, trying to use all\nhis mind on the subject which occupied it. At last he roused himself,\nalmost with a start, and leaving his chair, walked three or four\ntimes the length of the room. \"Why should I not?\" at last he said to\nhimself, stopping suddenly and placing his hand upon the table. \"Why\nshould I not, if it pleases me? It shall not injure him--nor her.\"\nAnd then he walked again. \"But I will ask Edith,\" he said, still\nspeaking to himself. \"If she says that she disapproves of it, I will\nnot do it.\" And then he left the room, while the wine still remained\nuntasted on the table.\n\n[Illustration: \"Why should I not?\"]\n\nOn the day following Christmas Mr. Furnival went up to town, and Mr.\nRound junior,--Mat Round, as he was called in the profession,--came\nto him at his chambers. A promise had been made to the barrister by\nRound and Crook that no active steps should be taken against Lady\nMason on the part of Joseph Mason of Groby, without notice being\ngiven to Mr. Furnival. And this visit by appointment was made in\nconsequence of that promise.\n\n\"You see,\" said Matthew Round, when that visit was nearly brought to\na close, \"that we are pressed very hard to go on with this, and if we\ndo not, somebody else will.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, if I were you, I should decline,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"You're looking to your client, not to ours, sir,\" said the attorney.\n\"The fact is that the whole case is very queer. It was proved on the\nlast trial that Bolster and Kenneby were witnesses to a deed on the\n14th of July, and that was all that was proved. Now we can prove that\nthey were on that day witnesses to another deed. Were they witnesses\nto two?\"\n\n\"Why should they not be?\"\n\n\"That is for us to see. We have written to them both to come up to\nus, and in order that we might be quite on the square I thought it\nright to tell you.\"\n\n\"Thank you; yes; I cannot complain of you. And what form do you think\nthat your proceedings will take?\"\n\n\"Joseph Mason talks of indicting her for--forgery,\" said the\nattorney, pausing a moment before he dared to pronounce the dread\nword.\n\n\"Indict her for forgery!\" said Furnival, with a start. And yet the\nidea was one which had been for some days present to his mind's eye.\n\n\"I do not say so,\" said Round. \"I have as yet seen none of the\nwitnesses myself. If they are prepared to prove that they did sign\ntwo separate documents on that day, the thing must pass off.\" It was\nclear to Mr. Furnival that even Mr. Round junior would be glad that\nit should pass off. And then he also sat thinking. Might it not be\nprobable that, with a little judicious exercise of their memory,\nthose two witnesses would remember that they had signed two\ndocuments; or at any rate, looking to the lapse of the time, that\nthey might be induced to forget altogether whether they had signed\none, two, or three? Or even if they could be mystified so that\nnothing could be proved, it would still be well with his client.\nIndeed no magistrate would commit such a person as Lady Mason,\nespecially after so long an interval, and no grand jury would find a\nbill against her, except upon evidence that was clear, well defined,\nand almost indubitable. If any point of doubt could be shown, she\nmight be brought off without a trial, if only she would be true\nto herself. At the former trial there was the existing codicil,\nand the fact also that the two surviving reputed witnesses would\nnot deny their signatures. These signatures--if they were genuine\nsignatures--had been attached with all proper formality, and the form\nused went to state that the testator had signed the instrument in the\npresence of them all, they all being present together at the same\ntime. The survivors had both asserted that when they did affix their\nnames the three were then present, as was also Sir Joseph; but\nthere had been a terrible doubt even then as to the identity of the\ndocument; and a doubt also as to there having been any signature made\nby one of the reputed witnesses--by that one, namely, who at the\ntime of that trial was dead. Now another document was forthcoming,\npurporting to have been witnessed, on the same day, by these two\nsurviving witnesses! If that document were genuine, and if these\ntwo survivors should be clear that they had written their names but\nonce on that 14th of July, in such case could it be possible to\nquash further public inquiry? The criminal prosecution might not be\npossible as a first proceeding, but if the estate were recovered at\ncommon law, would not the criminal prosecution follow as a matter of\ncourse? And then Mr. Furnival thought it all over again and again.\n\nIf this document were genuine,--this new document which the man\nDockwrath stated that he had found,--this deed of separation of\npartnership which purported to have been executed on that 14th of\nJuly! That was now the one important question. If it were genuine!\nAnd why should there not be as strong a question of the honesty\nof that document as of the other? Mr. Furnival well knew that no\nfraudulent deed would be forged and produced without a motive; and\nthat if he impugned this deed he must show the motive. Motive enough\nthere was, no doubt. Mason might have had it forged in order to get\nthe property, or Dockwrath to gratify his revenge. But in such case\nit would be a forgery of the present day. There could have been no\nmotive for such a forgery twenty years ago. The paper, the writing,\nthe attested signature of Martock, the other party to it, would prove\nthat it had not been got up and manufactured now. Dockwrath would not\ndare to bring forward such a forgery as that. There was no hope of\nany such result.\n\nBut might not he, Furnival, if the matter were pushed before a jury,\nmake them think that the two documents stood balanced against each\nother? and that Lady Mason's respectability, her long possession,\ntogether with the vile malignity of her antagonists, gave the greater\nprobability of honesty to the disputed codicil? Mr. Furnival did\nthink that he might induce a jury to acquit her; but he terribly\nfeared that he might not be able to induce the world to acquit her\nalso. As he thought of all the case, he seemed to put himself apart\nfrom the world at large. He did not question himself as to his own\nbelief, but seemed to feel that it would suffice for him if he could\nso bring it about that her other friends should think her innocent.\nIt would by no means suffice for him to secure for her son the\nproperty, and for her a simple acquittal. It was not that he dreaded\nthe idea of thinking her guilty himself; perhaps he did so think her\nnow--he half thought her so, at any rate; but he greatly dreaded the\nidea of others thinking so. It might be well to buy up Dockwrath, if\nit were possible. If it were possible! But then it was not possible\nthat he himself could have a hand in such a matter. Could Crabwitz do\nit? No; he thought not. And then, at this moment, he was not certain\nthat he could depend on Crabwitz.\n\nAnd why should he trouble himself in this way? Mr. Furnival was a\nman loyal to his friends at heart. Had Lady Mason been a man, and had\nhe pulled that man through great difficulties in early life, he\nwould have been loyally desirous of carrying him through the same or\nsimilar difficulties at any after period. In that cause which he had\nonce battled he was always ready to do battle, without reference to\nany professional consideration of triumph or profit. It was to this\nfeeling of loyalty that he had owed much of his success in life. And\nin such a case as this it may be supposed that that feeling would be\nstrong. But then such a feeling presumed a case in which he could\nsympathise--in which he could believe. Would it be well that he\nshould allow himself to feel the same interest in this case, to\nmaintain respecting it the same personal anxiety, if he ceased to\nbelieve in it? He did ask himself the question, and he finally\nanswered it in the affirmative. He had beaten Joseph Mason once in a\ngood stand-up fight; and having done so, having thus made the matter\nhis own, it was necessary to his comfort that he should beat him\nagain, if another fight were to be fought. Lady Mason was his client,\nand all the associations of his life taught him to be true to her as\nsuch.\n\nAnd as we are thus searching into his innermost heart we must say\nmore than this. Mrs. Furnival perhaps had no sufficient grounds for\nthose terrible fears of hers; but nevertheless the mistress of Orley\nFarm was very comely in the eyes of the lawyer. Her eyes, when full\nof tears, were very bright, and her hand, as it lay in his, was very\nsoft. He laid out for himself no scheme of wickedness with reference\nto her; he purposely entertained no thoughts which he knew to be\nwrong; but, nevertheless, he did feel that he liked to have her by\nhim, that he liked to be her adviser and friend, that he liked to\nwipe the tears from those eyes--not by a material handkerchief from\nhis pocket, but by immaterial manly sympathy from his bosom; and that\nhe liked also to feel the pressure of that hand. Mrs. Furnival had\nbecome solid, and heavy, and red; and though he himself was solid,\nand heavy, and red also--more so, indeed, in proportion than his poor\nwife, for his redness, as I have said before, had almost reached a\npurple hue; nevertheless his eye loved to look upon the beauty of a\nlovely woman, his ear loved to hear the tone of her voice, and his\nhand loved to meet the soft ripeness of her touch. It was very wrong\nthat it should have been so, but the case is not without a parallel.\n\nAnd therefore he made up his mind that he would not desert Lady\nMason. He would not desert her; but how would he set about the\nfighting that would be necessary in her behalf? He was well aware of\nthis, that if he fought at all, he must fight now. It would not do to\nlet the matter go on till she should be summoned to defend herself.\nSteps which might now be available would be altogether unavailable in\ntwo or three months' time--would be so, perhaps, if he allowed two or\nthree weeks to pass idly by him. Mr. Round, luckily, was not disposed\nto hurry his proceedings; nor, as far as he was concerned, was there\nany bitterness of antagonism. But with both Mason and Dockwrath there\nwould be hot haste, and hotter malice. From those who were really her\nenemies she could expect no quarter.\n\nHe was to return on that evening to Noningsby, and on the following\nday he would go over to The Cleeve. He knew that Lady Mason was\nstaying there; but his object in making that visit would not be\nmerely that he might see her, but also that he might speak to Sir\nPeregrine, and learn how far the baronet was inclined to support\nhis neighbour in her coming tribulation. He would soon be able to\nascertain what Sir Peregrine really thought--whether he suspected the\npossibility of any guilt; and he would ascertain also what was the\ngeneral feeling in the neighbourhood of Hamworth. It would be a great\nthing if he could spread abroad a conviction that she was an injured\nwoman. It would be a great thing even if he could make it known that\nthe great people of the neighbourhood so thought. The jurymen of\nAlston would be mortal men; and it might be possible that they should\nbe imbued with a favourable bias on the subject before they assembled\nin their box for its consideration.\n\nHe wished that he knew the truth in the matter; or rather he wished\nhe could know whether or no she were innocent, without knowing\nwhether or no she were guilty. The fight in his hands would be\nconducted on terms so much more glorious if he could feel sure of her\ninnocence. But then if he attempted that, and she were not innocent,\nall might be sacrificed by the audacity of his proceedings. He could\nnot venture that, unless he were sure of his ground. For a moment or\ntwo he thought that he would ask her the question. He said to himself\nthat he could forgive the fault. That it had been repented ere this\nhe did not doubt, and it would be sweet to say to her that it was\nvery grievous, but that yet it might be forgiven. It would be sweet\nto feel that she was in his hands, and that he would treat her with\nmercy and kindness. But then a hundred other thoughts forbade him to\nthink more of this. If she had been, guilty,--if she declared her\nguilt to him,--would not restitution be necessary? In that case her\nson must know it, and all the world must know it. Such a confession\nwould be incompatible with that innocence before the world which it\nwas necessary that she should maintain. Moreover, he must be able to\nproclaim aloud his belief in her innocence; and how could he do that,\nknowing her to be guilty--knowing that she also knew that he had such\nknowledge? It was impossible that he should ask any such question, or\nadmit of any such confidence.\n\nIt would be necessary, if the case did come to a trial, that\nshe should employ some attorney. The matter must come into the\nbarrister's hands in the usual way, through a solicitor's house, and\nit would be well that the person employed should have a firm faith in\nhis client. What could he say--he, as a barrister--if the attorney\nsuggested to him that the lady might possibly be guilty? As he\nthought of all these things he almost dreaded the difficulties before\nhim.\n\nHe rang the bell for Crabwitz,--the peculiar bell which Crabwitz was\nbound to answer,--having first of all gone through a little ceremony\nwith his cheque-book. Crabwitz entered, still sulky in his demeanour,\nfor as yet the old anger had not been appeased, and it was still a\ndoubtful matter in the clerk's mind whether or no it might not be\nbetter for him to seek a master who would better appreciate his\nservices. A more lucrative position it might be difficult for him to\nfind; but money is not everything, as Crabwitz said to himself more\nthan once.\n\n\"Crabwitz,\" said Mr. Furnival, looking with a pleasant face at his\nclerk, \"I am leaving town this evening, and I shall be absent for the\nnext ten days. If you like you can go away for a holiday.\"\n\n\"It's rather late in the season now, sir,\" said Crabwitz, gloomily,\nas though he were determined not to be pleased.\n\n\"It is a little late, as you say; but I really could not manage it\nearlier. Come, Crabwitz, you and I should not quarrel. Your work has\nbeen a little hard, but then so has mine also.\"\n\n\"I fancy you like it, sir.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha! Like it, indeed! But so do you like it--in its way. Come,\nCrabwitz, you have been an excellent servant to me; and I don't think\nthat, on the whole, I have been a bad master to you.\"\n\n\"I am making no complaint, sir.\"\n\n\"But you're cross because I've kept you in town a little too long.\nCome, Crabwitz, you must forget all that. You have worked very hard\nthis year past. Here is a cheque for fifty pounds. Get out of town\nfor a fortnight or so, and amuse yourself.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very much obliged, sir,\" said Crabwitz, putting out\nhis hand and taking the cheque. He felt that his master had got the\nbetter of him, and he was still a little melancholy on that account.\nHe would have valued his grievance at that moment almost more\nthan the fifty pounds, especially as by the acceptance of it he\nsurrendered all right to complain for some considerable time to come.\n\n\"By-the-by, Crabwitz,\" said Mr. Furnival, as the clerk was about to\nleave the room.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Crabwitz.\n\n\"You have never chanced to hear of an attorney named Dockwrath, I\nsuppose?\"\n\n\"What! in London, Mr. Furnival?\"\n\n\"No; I fancy he has no place of business in town. He lives I know at\nHamworth.\"\n\n\"It's he you mean, sir, that is meddling in this affair of Lady\nMason's.\"\n\n\"What! you have heard of that; have you?\"\n\n\"Oh! yes, sir. It's being a good deal talked about in the profession.\nMessrs. Round and Crook's leading young man was up here with me the\nother day, and he did say a good deal about it. He's a very decent\nyoung man, considering his position, is Smart.\"\n\n\"And he knows Dockwrath, does he?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I can't say that he knows much of the man; but Dockwrath\nhas been at their place of business pretty constant of late, and he\nand Mr. Matthew seem thick enough together.\"\n\n\"Oh! they do; do they?\"\n\n\"So Smart tells me. I don't know how it is myself, sir. I don't\nsuppose this Dockwrath is a very--\"\n\n\"No, no; exactly. I dare say not. You've never seen him yourself,\nCrabwitz?\"\n\n\"Who, sir? I, sir? No, sir, I've never set eyes on the man, sir. From\nall I hear it's not very likely he should come here; and I'm sure it\nis not at all likely that I should go to him.\"\n\nMr. Furnival sat thinking awhile, and the clerk stood waiting\nopposite to him, leaning with both his hands upon the table. \"You\ndon't know any one in the neighbourhood of Hamworth, I suppose?\" Mr.\nFurnival said at last.\n\n\"Who, sir? I, sir? Not a soul, sir. I never was there in my life.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you why I ask. I strongly suspect that that man Dockwrath\nis at some very foul play.\" And then he told to his clerk so much of\nthe whole story of Lady Mason and her affairs as he chose that he\nshould know. \"It is plain enough that he may give Lady Mason a great\ndeal of annoyance,\" he ended by saying.\n\n\"There's no doubting that, sir,\" said Crabwitz. \"And, to tell the\ntruth, I believe his mind is made up to do it.\"\n\n\"You don't think that anything could be done by seeing him? Of course\nLady Mason has got nothing to compromise. Her son's estate is as safe\nas my hat; but--\"\n\n\"The people at Round's think it isn't quite so safe, sir.\"\n\n\"Then the people at Round's know nothing about it. But Lady Mason is\nso averse to legal proceedings that it would be worth her while to\nhave matters settled. You understand?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; I understand. Would not an attorney be the best person,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Not just at present, Crabwitz. Lady Mason is a very dear friend of\nmine--\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; we know that,\" said Crabwitz.\n\n\"If you could make any pretence for running down to Hamworth--change\nof air, you know, for a week or so. It's a beautiful country; just\nthe place you like. And you might find out whether anything could be\ndone, eh?\"\n\nMr. Crabwitz was well aware, from the first, that he did not get\nfifty pounds for nothing.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nWHY SHOULD I NOT?\n\n\nA day or two after his conversation with Crabwitz, as described in\nthe last chapter, Mr. Furnival was driven up to the door of Sir\nPeregrine Orme's house in a Hamworth fly. He had come over by train\nfrom Alston on purpose to see the baronet, whom he found seated in\nhis library. At that very moment he was again asking himself those\nquestions which he had before asked as he was walking up and down his\nown dining-room. \"Why should I not?\" he said to himself,--\"unless,\nindeed, it will make her unhappy.\" And then the barrister was shown\ninto his room, muffled up to his eyes in his winter clothing.\n\nSir Peregrine and Mr. Furnival were well known to each other, and had\nalways met as friends. They had been interested on the same side in\nthe first Orley Farm Case, and possessed a topic of sympathy in their\nmutual dislike to Joseph Mason of Groby Park. Sir Peregrine therefore\nwas courteous, and when he learned the subject on which he was to be\nconsulted he became almost more than courteous.\n\n\"Oh! yes; she's staying here, Mr. Furnival. Would you like to see\nher?\"\n\n\"Before I leave I shall be glad to see her, Sir Peregrine; but if I\nam justified in regarding you as specially her friend, it may perhaps\nbe well that I should first have some conversation with you.\" Sir\nPeregrine in answer to this declared that Mr. Furnival certainly\nwould be so justified; that he did regard himself as Lady Mason's\nspecial friend, and that he was ready to hear anything that the\nbarrister might have to say to him.\n\nMany of the points of this case have already been named so often, and\nwill, I fear, be necessarily named so often again that I will spare\nthe repetition when it is possible. Mr. Furnival on this occasion\ntold Sir Peregrine--not all that he had heard, but all that he\nthought it necessary to tell, and soon became fully aware that in the\nbaronet's mind there was not the slightest shadow of suspicion that\nLady Mason could have been in any way to blame. He, the baronet, was\nthoroughly convinced that Mr. Mason was the great sinner in this\nmatter, and that he was prepared to harass an innocent and excellent\nlady from motives of disappointed cupidity and long-sustained malice,\nwhich made him seem in Sir Peregrine's eyes a being almost too vile\nfor humanity. And of Dockwrath he thought almost as badly--only that\nDockwrath was below the level of his thinking. Of Lady Mason he spoke\nas an excellent and beautiful woman driven to misery by unworthy\npersecution; and so spoke with an enthusiasm that was surprising\nto Mr. Furnival. It was very manifest that she would not want for\nfriendly countenance, if friendly countenance could carry her through\nher difficulties.\n\nThere was no suspicion against Lady Mason in the mind of Sir\nPeregrine, and Mr. Furnival was careful not to arouse any such\nfeeling. When he found that the baronet spoke of her as being\naltogether pure and good, he also spoke of her in the same tone; but\nin doing so his game was very difficult. \"Let him do his worst, Mr.\nFurnival,\" said Sir Peregrine; \"and let her remain tranquil; that is\nmy advice to Lady Mason. It is not possible that he can really injure\nher.\"\n\n\"It is possible that he can do nothing--very probable that he can do\nnothing; but nevertheless, Sir Peregrine--\"\n\n\"I would have no dealing with him or his. I would utterly disregard\nthem. If he, or they, or any of them choose to take steps to annoy\nher, let her attorney manage that in the usual way. I am no lawyer\nmyself, Mr. Furnival, but that I think is the manner in which things\nof this kind should be arranged. I do not know whether they have\nstill the power of disputing the will, but if so, let them do it.\"\n\nGradually, by very slow degrees, Mr. Furnival made Sir Peregrine\nunderstand that the legal doings now threatened were not of that\nnature;--that Mr. Mason did not now talk of proceeding at law for\nthe recovery of the property, but for the punishment of his father's\nwidow as a criminal; and at last the dreadful word \"forgery\" dropped\nfrom his lips.\n\n\"Who dares to make such a charge as that?\" demanded the baronet,\nwhile fire literally flashed from his eyes in his anger. And when he\nwas told that Mr. Mason did make such a charge he called him \"a mean,\nunmanly dastard.\" \"I do not believe that he would dare to make it\nagainst a man,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\nBut there was the fact of the charge--the fact that it had been\nplaced in the hands of respectable attorneys, with instructions to\nthem to press it on--and the fact also that the evidence by which\nthat charge was to be supported possessed at any rate a _prim\u00c3\u00a2 facie_\nappearance of strength. All that it was necessary to explain to Sir\nPeregrine, as it would also be necessary to explain it to Lady Mason.\n\n\"Am I to understand, then, that you also think--?\" began Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"You are not to understand that I think anything injurious to the\nlady; but I do fear that she is in a position of much jeopardy, and\nthat great care will be necessary.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! Do you mean to say that an innocent person can under\nsuch circumstances be in danger in this country?\"\n\n\"An innocent person, Sir Peregrine, may be in danger of very great\nannoyance, and also of very great delay in proving that innocence.\nInnocent people have died under the weight of such charges. We must\nremember that she is a woman, and therefore weaker than you or I.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; but still--. You do not say that you think she can be in\nany real danger?\" It seemed, from the tone of the old man's voice, as\nthough he were almost angry with Mr. Furnival for supposing that such\ncould be the case. \"And you intend to tell her all this?\" he asked.\n\n\"I fear that, as her friend, neither you nor I will be warranted in\nkeeping her altogether in the dark. Think what her feelings would be\nif she were summoned before a magistrate without any preparation!\"\n\n\"No magistrate would listen to such a charge,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"In that he must be guided by the evidence.\"\n\n\"I would sooner throw up my commission than lend myself in any way to\na proceeding so iniquitous.\"\n\nThis was all very well, and the existence of such a feeling showed\ngreat generosity, and perhaps also poetic chivalry on the part of\nSir Peregrine Orme; but it was not the way of the world, and so Mr.\nFurnival was obliged to explain. Magistrates would listen to the\ncharge--would be forced to listen to the charge,--if the evidence\nwere apparently sound. A refusal on the part of a magistrate to do\nso would not be an act of friendship to Lady Mason, as Mr. Furnival\nendeavoured to explain. \"And you wish to see her?\" Sir Peregrine\nasked at last.\n\n\"I think she should be told; but as she is in your house, I will,\nof course, do nothing in which you do not concur.\" Upon which\nSir Peregrine rang the bell and desired the servant to take his\ncompliments to Lady Mason and beg her attendance in the library if\nit were quite convenient. \"Tell her,\" said Sir Peregrine, \"that Mr.\nFurnival is here.\"\n\nWhen the message was given to her she was seated with Mrs. Orme, and\nat the moment she summoned strength to say that she would obey the\ninvitation, without displaying any special emotion while the servant\nwas in the room; but when the door was shut, her friend looked at her\nand saw that she was as pale as death. She was pale and her limbs\nquivered, and that look of agony, which now so often marked her face,\nwas settled on her brow. Mrs. Orme had never yet seen her with such\nmanifest signs of suffering as she wore at this instant.\n\n\"I suppose I must go to them,\" she said, slowly rising from her seat;\nand it seemed to Mrs. Orme that she was forced to hold by the table\nto support herself.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival is a friend, is he not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! a kind friend, but--\"\n\n\"They shall come in here if you like it better, dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! I will go to them. It would not do that I should seem so\nweak. What must you think of me to see me so?\"\n\n\"I do not wonder at it, dear,\" said Mrs. Orme, coming round to her;\n\"such cruelty would kill me. I wonder at your strength rather than\nyour weakness.\" And then she kissed her. What was there about the\nwoman that had made all those fond of her that came near her?\n\nMrs. Orme walked with her across the hall, and left her only at the\nlibrary door. There she pressed her hand and again kissed her, and\nthen Lady Mason turned the handle of the door and entered the room.\nMr. Furnival, when he looked at her, was startled by the pallor of\nher face, but nevertheless he thought that she had never looked so\nbeautiful. \"Dear Lady Mason,\" said he, \"I hope you are well.\"\n\nSir Peregrine advanced to her and handed her over to his own\narm-chair. Had she been a queen in distress she could not have been\ntreated with more gentle deference. But she never seemed to count\nupon this, or in any way to assume it as her right. I should accuse\nher of what I regard as a sin against all good taste were I to say\nthat she was humble in her demeanour; but there was a soft meekness\nabout her, an air of feminine dependence, a proneness to lean\nand almost to cling as she leaned, which might have been felt as\nirresistible by any man. She was a woman to know in her deep sorrow\nrather than in her joy and happiness; one with whom one would love to\nweep rather than to rejoice. And, indeed, the present was a time with\nher for weeping, not for rejoicing.\n\nSir Peregrine looked as though he were her father as he took her\nhand, and the barrister immediately comforted himself with the\nremembrance of the baronet's great age. It was natural, too, that\nLady Mason should hang on him in his own house. So Mr. Furnival\ncontented himself at the first moment with touching her hand and\nhoping that she was well. She answered hardly a word to either of\nthem, but she attempted to smile as she sat down, and murmured\nsomething about the trouble she was giving them.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival thinks it best that you should be made aware of the\nsteps which are being taken by Mr. Mason of Groby Park,\" began Sir\nPeregrine. \"I am no lawyer myself, and therefore of course I cannot\nput my advice against his.\"\n\n\"I am sure that both of you will tell me for the best,\" she said.\n\n\"In such a matter as this it is right that you should be guided by\nhim. That he is as firmly your friend as I am there can be no doubt.\"\n\n\"I believe Lady Mason trusts me in that,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Indeed I do; I would trust you both in anything,\" she said.\n\n\"And there can be no doubt that he must be able to direct you for\nthe best. I say so much at the first, because I myself so thoroughly\ndespise that man in Yorkshire,--I am so convinced that anything which\nhis malice may prompt him to do must be futile, that I could not\nmyself have thought it needful to pain you by what must now be said.\"\n\nThis was a dreadful commencement, but she bore it, and even was\nrelieved by it. Indeed, no tale that Mr. Furnival could have to tell\nafter such an exordium would be so bad as that which she had feared\nas the possible result of his visit. He might have come there to let\nher know that she was at once to be carried away--immediately to be\ntaken to her trial--perhaps to be locked up in gaol. In her ignorance\nof the law she could only imagine what might or might not happen to\nher at any moment, and therefore the words which Sir Peregrine had\nspoken relieved her rather than added to her fears.\n\nAnd then Mr. Furnival began his tale, and gradually put before her\nthe facts of the matter. This he did with a choice of language and a\ndelicacy of phraseology which were admirable, for he made her clearly\nunderstand the nature of the accusation which was brought against her\nwithout using any word which was in itself harsh in its bearing. He\nsaid nothing about fraud, or forgery, or false evidence, but he made\nit manifest to her that Joseph Mason had now instructed his lawyer\nto institute a criminal proceeding against her for having forged a\ncodicil to her husband's will.\n\n\"I must bear it as best I may,\" she said. \"May the Lord give me\nstrength to bear it!\"\n\n\"It is terrible to think of,\" said Sir Peregrine; \"but nobody can\ndoubt how it will end. You are not to suppose that Mr. Furnival\nintends to express any doubt as to your ultimate triumph. What we\nfear for you is the pain you must endure before this triumph comes.\"\n\nAh, if that were all! As the baronet finished speaking she looked\nfurtively into the lawyer's face to see how far the meaning of these\nsmooth words would be supported by what she might read there. Would\nhe also think that a final triumph did certainly await her? Sir\nPeregrine's real opinion was easily to be learned, either from his\ncountenance or from his words; but it was not so with Mr. Furnival.\nIn Mr. Furnival's face, and from Mr. Furnival's words, could be\nlearned only that which Mr. Furnival wished to declare. He saw that\nglance, and fully understood it; and he knew instinctively, on the\nspur of the moment, that he must now either assure her by a lie, or\nbreak down all her hopes by the truth. That final triumph was not\ncertain to her--was very far from certain! Should he now be honest to\nhis friend, or dishonest? One great object with him was to secure the\nsupport which Sir Peregrine could give by his weight in the county;\nand therefore, as Sir Peregrine was present, it was needful that he\nshould be dishonest. Arguing thus he looked the lie, and Lady Mason\nderived more comfort from that look than from all Sir Peregrine's\nwords.\n\nAnd then those various details were explained to her which Mr.\nFurnival understood that Mr. Dockwrath had picked up. They went into\nthat matter of the partnership deed, and questions were asked as to\nthe man Kenneby and the woman Bolster. They might both, Lady Mason\nsaid, have been witnesses to half a dozen deeds on that same day, for\naught she knew to the contrary. She had been present with Sir Joseph,\nas far as she could now remember, during the whole of that morning,\n\"in and out, Sir Peregrine, as you can understand.\" Sir Peregrine\nsaid that he did understand perfectly. She did know that Mr. Usbech\nhad been there for many hours that day, probably from ten to two\nor three, and no doubt therefore much business was transacted. She\nherself remembered nothing but the affair of the will; but then that\nwas natural, seeing that there was no other affair in which she had\nspecially interested herself.\n\n\"No doubt these people did witness both the deeds,\" said Sir\nPeregrine. \"For myself, I cannot conceive how that wretched man can\nbe so silly as to spend his money on such a case as this.\"\n\n\"He would do anything for revenge,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\nAnd then Lady Mason was allowed to go back to the drawing-room, and\nwhat remained to be said was said between the two gentlemen alone.\nSir Peregrine was very anxious that his own attorneys should be\nemployed, and he named Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile, than whom there\nwere no more respectable men in the whole profession. But then Mr.\nFurnival feared that they were too respectable. They might look at\nthe matter in so straightforward a light as to fancy their client\nreally guilty; and what might happen then? Old Slow would not conceal\nthe truth for all the baronets in England--no, nor for all the pretty\nwomen. The touch of Lady Mason's hand and the tear in her eye would\nbe nothing to old Slow. Mr. Furnival, therefore, was obliged to\nexplain that Slow and Bideawhile did not undertake that sort of\nbusiness.\n\n\"But I should wish it to be taken up through them. There must be\nsome expenditure, Mr. Furnival, and I should prefer that they should\narrange about that.\"\n\nMr. Furnival made no further immediate objection, and consented at\nlast to having an interview with one of the firm on the subject,\nprovided, of course, that that member of the firm came to him at his\nchambers. And then he took his leave. Nothing positive had been done,\nor even settled to be done, on this morning; but the persons most\ninterested in the matter had been made to understand that the affair\nwas taking an absolute palpable substance, and that steps must be\ntaken--indeed would be taken almost immediately. Mr. Furnival, as he\nleft the house, resolved to employ the attorneys whom he might think\nbest adapted for the purpose. He would settle that matter with Slow\nand Bideawhile afterwards.\n\nAnd then, as he returned to Noningsby, he wondered at his persistence\nin the matter. He believed that his client had been guilty; he\nbelieved that this codicil was no real instrument made by Sir Joseph\nMason. And so believing, would it not be better for him to wash his\nhands of the whole affair? Others did not think so, and would it not\nbe better that such others should be her advisers? Was he not taking\nup for himself endless trouble and annoyance that could have no\nuseful purpose? So he argued with himself, and yet by the time that\nhe had reached Noningsby he had determined that he would stand by\nLady Mason to the last. He hated that man Mason, as he declared to\nhimself when providing himself with reasons for his resolve, and\nregarded his bitter, malicious justice as more criminal than any\ncrime of which Lady Mason might have been guilty. And then as he\nleaned back in the railway carriage he still saw her pale face before\nhim, still heard the soft tone of her voice, and was still melted by\nthe tear in her eye. Young man, young friend of mine, who art now\nfilled to the overflowing of thy brain with poetry, with chivalry,\nand love, thou seest seated opposite to thee there that grim old man,\nwith long snuffy nose, with sharp piercing eyes, with scanty frizzled\nhairs. He is rich and cross, has been three times married, and has\noften quarrelled with his children. He is fond of his wine, and\nsnores dreadfully after dinner. To thy seeming he is a dry, withered\nstick, from which all the sap of sentiment has been squeezed by the\nrubbing and friction of years. Poetry, the feeling if not the words\nof poetry,--is he not dead to it, even as the pavement is dead over\nwhich his wheels trundle? Oh, my young friend! thou art ignorant in\nthis--as in most other things. He may not twitter of sentiment, as\nthou doest; nor may I trundle my hoop along the high road as do the\nlittle boys. The fitness of things forbids it. But that old man's\nheart is as soft as thine, if thou couldst but read it. The body\ndries up and withers away, and the bones grow old; the brain, too,\nbecomes decrepit, as do the sight, the hearing, and the soul. But the\nheart that is tender once remains tender to the last.\n\nLady Mason, when she left the library, walked across the hall towards\nthe drawing-room, and then she paused. She would fain remain alone\nfor a while if it were possible, and therefore she turned aside into\na small breakfast parlour, which was used every morning, but which\nwas rarely visited afterwards during the day. Here she sat, leaving\nthe door slightly open, so that she might know when Mr. Furnival left\nthe baronet. Here she sat for a full hour, waiting--waiting--waiting.\nThere was no sofa or lounging-chair in the room, reclining in which\nshe could remain there half sleeping, sitting comfortably at her\nease; but she placed herself near the table, and leaning there with\nher face upon her hand, she waited patiently till Mr. Furnival had\ngone. That her mind was full of thoughts I need hardly say, but yet\nthe hour seemed very long to her. At last she heard the library door\nopen, she heard Sir Peregrine's voice as he stood in the hall and\nshook hands with his departing visitor, she heard the sound of the\nwheels as the fly moved upon the gravel, and then she heard Sir\nPeregrine again shut the library door behind him.\n\nShe did not immediately get up from her chair; she still waited\nawhile, perhaps for another period of ten minutes, and then she\nnoiselessly left the room, and moving quickly and silently across the\nhall she knocked at Sir Peregrine's door. This she did so gently that\nat first no answer was made to her. Then she knocked again, hardly\nlouder but with a repeated rap, and Sir Peregrine summoned her to\ncome in. \"May I trouble you once more--for one moment?\" she said.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly; it is no trouble. I am glad that you are here\nin the house at this time, that you may see me at any moment that you\nmay wish.\"\n\n\"I do not know why you should be so good to me.\"\n\n\"Because you are in great grief, in undeserved grief, because--. Lady\nMason, my services are at your command. I will act for you as I would\nfor a--daughter.\"\n\n\"You hear now of what it is that they accuse me.\"\n\n\"Yes, he said; I do hear;\" and as he spoke he came round so that he\nwas standing near to her, but with his back to the fireplace. \"I do\nhear, and I blush to think that there is a man in England, holding\nthe position of a county magistrate, who can so forget all that is\ndue to honesty, to humanity, and to self-respect.\"\n\n\"You do not then think that I have been guilty of this thing?\"\n\n\"Guilty--I think you guilty! No, nor does he think so. It is\nimpossible that he should think so. I am no more sure of my own\ninnocence than of yours;\" and as he spoke he took both her hands and\nlooked into her face, and his eyes also were full of tears. \"You\nmay be sure of this, that neither I nor Edith will ever think you\nguilty.\"\n\n\"Dearest Edith,\" she said; she had never before called Sir\nPeregrine's daughter-in-law by her Christian name, and as she now did\nso she almost felt that she had sinned. But Sir Peregrine took it in\ngood part. \"She is dearest,\" he said; \"and be sure of this, that she\nwill be true to you through it all.\"\n\nAnd so they stood for a while without further speech. He still held\nboth her hands, and the tears still stood in his eyes. Her eyes were\nturned to the ground, and from them the tears were running fast. At\nfirst they ran silently, without audible sobbing, and Sir Peregrine,\nwith his own old eyes full of salt water, hardly knew that she was\nweeping. But gradually the drops fell upon his hand, one by one at\nfirst, and then faster and faster; and soon there came a low sob, a\nsob all but suppressed, but which at last forced itself forth, and\nthen her head fell upon his shoulder. \"My dear,\" he said, himself\nhardly able to speak; \"my poor dear, my ill-used dear!\" and as she\nwithdrew one hand from his, that she might press a handkerchief to\nher face, his vacant arm passed itself round her waist. \"My poor,\nill-used dear!\" he said again, as he pressed her to his old heart,\nand leaning over her he kissed her lips.\n\nSo she stood for some few seconds, feeling that she was pressed\nclose by the feeble pressure of his arm, and then she gradually sank\nthrough from his embrace, and fell upon her knees at his feet. She\nknelt at his feet, supporting herself with one arm upon the table,\nand with the other hand she still held his hand over which her head\nwas bowed. \"My friend,\" she said, still sobbing, and sobbing loudly\nnow; \"my friend, that God has sent me in my trouble.\" And then, with\nwords that were wholly inaudible, she murmured some prayer on his\nbehalf.\n\n\"I am better now,\" she said, raising herself quickly to her feet when\na few seconds had passed. \"I am better now,\" and she stood erect\nbefore him. \"By God's mercy I will endure it; I think I can endure it\nnow.\"\n\n\"If I can lighten the load--\"\n\n\"You have lightened it--of half its weight; but, Sir Peregrine, I\nwill leave this--\"\n\n\"Leave this! go away from The Cleeve!\"\n\n\"Yes; I will not destroy the comfort of your home by the wretchedness\nof my position. I will not--\"\n\n\"Lady Mason, my house is altogether at your service. If you will be\nled by me in this matter, you will not leave it till this cloud shall\nhave passed by you. You will be better to be alone now;\" and then\nbefore she could answer him further, he led her to the door. She\nfelt that it was better for her to be alone, and she hastened up the\nstairs to her own chamber.\n\n\"And why should I not?\" said Sir Peregrine to himself, as he again\nwalked the length of the library.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nCOMMERCE.\n\n\nLucius Mason was still staying at Noningsby when Mr. Furnival made\nhis visit to Sir Peregrine, and on that afternoon he received a note\nfrom his mother. Indeed, there were three notes passed between them\non that afternoon, for he wrote an answer to his mother, and then\nreceived a reply to that answer. Lady Mason told him that she did not\nintend to return home to the Farm quite immediately, and explained\nthat her reason for not doing so was the necessity that she should\nhave assistance and advice at this period of her trouble. She did\nnot say that she misdoubted the wisdom of her son's counsels; but it\nappeared to him that she intended to signify to him that she did so,\nand he answered her in words that were sore and almost bitter. \"I am\nsorry,\" he said, \"that you and I cannot agree about a matter that is\nof such vital concern to both of us; but as it is so, we can only act\nas each thinks best, you for yourself and I for myself. I am sure,\nhowever, that you will believe that my only object is your happiness\nand your fair name, which is dearer to me than anything else in the\nworld.\" In answer to this, she had written again immediately, filling\nher letter with sweet words of motherly love, telling him that she\nwas sure, quite sure, of his affection and kind spirit, and excusing\nherself for not putting the matter altogether in his hands by saying\nthat she was forced to lean on those who had supported her from the\nbeginning--through that former trial which had taken place when he,\nLucius, was yet a baby. \"And, dearest Lucius, you must not be angry\nwith me,\" she went on to say; \"I am suffering much under this cruel\npersecution, but my sufferings would be more than doubled if my own\nboy quarrelled with me.\" Lucius, when he received this, flung up his\nhead. \"Quarrel with her,\" he said to himself; \"nothing on earth would\nmake me quarrel with her; but I cannot say that that is right which I\nthink to be wrong.\" His feelings were good and honest, and kindly too\nin their way; but tenderness of heart was not his weakness. I should\nwrong him if I were to say that he was hard-hearted, but he flattered\nhimself that he was just-hearted, which sometimes is nearly the\nsame--as had been the case with his father before him, and was now\nthe case with his half-brother Joseph.\n\nThe day after this was his last at Noningsby. He had told Lady\nStaveley that he intended to go, and though she had pressed his\nfurther stay, remarking that none of the young people intended to\nmove till after twelfth-night, nevertheless he persisted. With\nthe young people of the house themselves he had not much advanced\nhimself; and altogether he did not find himself thoroughly happy in\nthe judge's house. They were more thoughtless than he--as he thought;\nthey did not understand him, and therefore he would leave them.\nBesides, there was a great day of hunting coming on, at which\neverybody was to take a part, and as he did not hunt that gave\nhim another reason for going. \"They have nothing to do but amuse\nthemselves,\" he said to himself; \"but I have a man's work before me,\nand a man's misfortunes. I will go home and face both.\"\n\nIn all this there was much of conceit, much of pride, much of\ndeficient education,--deficiency in that special branch of education\nwhich England has imparted to the best of her sons, but which\nis now becoming out of fashion. He had never learned to measure\nhimself against others,--I do not mean his knowledge or his\nbook-acquirements, but the every-day conduct of his life,--and\nto perceive that that which is insignificant in others must be\ninsignificant in himself also. To those around him at Noningsby his\nextensive reading respecting the Iapetid\u00c3\u00a6 recommended him not at all,\nnor did his agricultural ambitions;--not even to Felix Graham, as a\ncompanion, though Felix Graham could see further into his character\nthan did the others. He was not such as they were. He had not the\nunpretentious, self-controlling humour, perfectly free from all\nconceit, which was common to them. Life did not come easy to him,\nand the effort which he was ever making was always visible. All men\nshould ever be making efforts, no doubt; but those efforts should\nnot be conspicuous. But yet Lucius Mason was not a bad fellow, and\nyoung Staveley showed much want of discernment when he called him\nempty-headed and selfish. Those epithets were by no means applicable\nto him. That he was not empty-headed is certain; and he was moreover\ncapable of a great self-sacrifice.\n\nThat his talents and good qualities were appreciated by one person\nin the house, seemed evident to Lady Staveley and the other married\nladies of the party. Miss Furnival, as they all thought, had not\nfound him empty-headed. And, indeed, it may be doubted whether Lady\nStaveley would have pressed his stay at Noningsby, had Miss Furnival\nbeen less gracious. Dear Lady Staveley was always living in a fever\nlest her only son, the light of her eyes, should fall irrevocably\nin love with some lady that was by no means good enough for him.\nRevocably in love he was daily falling; but some day he would go too\ndeep, and the waters would close over his well-loved head. Now in her\ndear old favouring eyes Sophia Furnival was by no means good enough,\nand it had been quite clear that Augustus had become thoroughly lost\nin his attempts to bring about a match between Felix Graham and\nthe barrister's daughter. In preparing the bath for his friend he\nhad himself fallen bodily into the water. He was always at Miss\nFurnival's side as long as Miss Furnival would permit it. But it\nseemed to Lady Staveley that Miss Furnival, luckily, was quite as\nfond of having Lucius Mason at her side;--that of the two she perhaps\npreferred Lucius Mason. That her taste and judgment should be so bad\nwas wonderful to Lady Staveley; but this depravity though wonderful\nwas useful; and therefore Lucius Mason might have been welcome to\nremain at Noningsby.\n\nIt may, however, be possible that Miss Furnival knew what she was\ndoing quite as well as Lady Staveley could know for her. In the\nfirst place she may possibly have thought it indiscreet to admit Mr.\nStaveley's attentions with too much freedom. She may have doubted\ntheir sincerity; or feared to give offence to the family, or Mr.\nMason may in her sight have been the preferable suitor. That his\ngifts of intellect were at any rate equal to those of the other there\ncan be no doubt. Then, his gifts of fortune were already his own, and\nfor ought that Miss Furnival knew, might be equal to any that would\never appertain to the other gentleman. That Lady Staveley should\nthink her swan better looking than Lady Mason's goose was very\nnatural; but then Lady Mason would no doubt have regarded the two\nbirds in an exactly opposite light. It is only fair to conceive that\nMiss Furnival was a better judge than either of them.\n\nOn the evening before his departure the whole party had been playing\ncommerce; for the rule of the house during these holidays was this,\nthat all the amusements brought into vogue were to be adapted to the\nchildren. If the grown-up people could adapt themselves to them, so\nmuch the better for them; if not, so much the worse; they must in\nsuch case provide for themselves. On the whole, the grown-up people\nseemed to live nearly as jovial a life as did the children. Whether\nthe judge himself was specially fond of commerce I cannot say; but he\npersisted in putting in the whole pool, and played through the entire\ngame, rigidly fighting for the same pool on behalf of a very small\ngrandchild, who sat during the whole time on his knee. There are\nthose who call cards the devil's books, but we will presume that the\njudge was of a different way of thinking.\n\nOn this special evening Sophia had been sitting next to Augustus,--a\nyoung man can always arrange these matters in his own house,--but had\nnevertheless lost all her lives early in the game. \"I will not have\nany cheating to-night,\" she had said to her neighbour; \"I will take\nmy chance, and if I die, I die. One can die but once.\" And so she\nhad died, three times indeed instead of once only, and had left the\ntable. Lucius Mason also had died. He generally did die the first,\nhaving no aptitude for a collection of kings or aces, and so they two\ncame together over the fire in the second drawing-room, far away from\nthe card-players. There was nothing at all remarkable in this, as Mr.\nFurnival and one or two others who did not play commerce were also\nthere; but nevertheless they were separated from those of the party\nwho were most inclined to criticise their conduct.\n\n\"So you are leaving to-morrow, Mr. Mason,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"Yes. I go home to-morrow after breakfast; to my own house, where for\nsome weeks to come I shall be absolutely alone.\"\n\n\"Your mother is staying at The Cleeve, I think.\"\n\n\"Yes,--and intends remaining there as she tells me. I wish with all\nmy heart she were at Orley Farm.\"\n\n\"Papa saw her yesterday. He went over to The Cleeve on purpose to see\nher; and this morning he has been talking to me about her. I cannot\ntell you how I grieve for her.\"\n\n\"It is very sad; very sad. But I wish she were in her own house.\nUnder the circumstances as they now are, I think it would be better\nfor her to be there than elsewhere. Her name has been disgraced--\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Mason; not disgraced.\"\n\n\"Yes; disgraced. Mark you; I do not say that she has been disgraced;\nand pray do not suppose it possible that I should think so. But a\ngreat opprobrium has been thrown on her name, and it would be better,\nI think, that she should remain at home till she has cast it off from\nher. Even for myself, I feel it almost wrong to be here; nor would I\nhave come had I known when I did come as much as I do know now.\"\n\n\"But no one can for a moment think that your mother has done anything\nthat she should not have done.\"\n\n\"Then why do so many people talk of her as though she had committed a\ngreat crime? Miss Furnival, I know that she is innocent. I know it as\nsurely as I know the fact of my own existence--\"\n\n\"And we all feel the same thing.\"\n\n\"But if you were in my place,--if it were your father whose name was\nso bandied about in people's mouths, you would think that it behoved\nhim to do nothing, to go nowhere, till he had forced the world to\nconfess his innocence. And this is ten times stronger with regard to\na woman. I have given my mother my counsel, and I regret to say that\nshe differs from me.\"\n\n\"Why do you not speak to papa?\"\n\n\"I did once. I went to him at his chambers, and he rebuked me.\"\n\n\"Rebuked you, Mr. Mason! He did not do that intentionally I am sure.\nI have heard him say that you are an excellent son.\"\n\n\"But nevertheless he did rebuke me. He considered that I was\ntravelling beyond my own concerns, in wishing to interfere for the\nprotection of my mother's name. He said that I should leave it to\nsuch people as the Staveleys and the Ormes to guard her from ignominy\nand disgrace.\"\n\n\"Oh, he did not mean that!\"\n\n\"But to me it seems that it should be a son's first duty. They are\ntalking of trouble and of cost. I would give every hour I have in the\nday, and every shilling I own in the world to save her from one week\nof such suffering as she now endures; but it cuts me to the heart\nwhen she tells me that because she is suffering, therefore she must\nseparate herself from me. I think it would be better for her, Miss\nFurnival, to be staying at home with me, than to be at The Cleeve.\"\n\n\"The kindness of Mrs. Orme must be a great support to her.\"\n\n\"And why should not my kindness be a support to her,--or rather my\naffection? We know from whom all these scandals come. My desire is to\nmeet that man in a court of law and thrust these falsehoods down his\nthroat.\"\n\n\"Ah! but you are a man.\"\n\n\"And therefore I would take the burden from her shoulders. But no;\nshe will not trust to me. The truth, Miss Furnival, is this, that she\nhas not yet learned to think of me as a man. To her I am still the\nboy for whom she is bound to provide, not the son who should bear\nfor her all her cares. As it is I feel that I do not dare again to\ntrouble her with my advice.\"\n\n\"Grandmamma is dead,\" shouted out a shrill small voice from the\ncard-table. \"Oh, grandmamma, do have one of my lives. Look! I've got\nthree,\" said another.\n\n\"Thank you, my dears; but the natural term of my existence has come,\nand I will not rebel against fate.\"\n\n\"Oh, grandmamma,--we'll let you have another grace.\"\n\n\"By no means, Charley. Indeed I am not clear that I am entitled to\nChristian burial, as it is.\"\n\n\"A case of felo de se, I rather think,\" said her son. \"About this\ntime of the night suicide does become common among the elders.\nUnfortunately for me, the pistol that I have been snapping at my own\nhead for the last half-hour always hangs fire.\"\n\nThere was not much of love-making in the conversation which had taken\nplace between young Mason and Sophia; not much at least up to this\npoint; but a confidence had been established, and before he left her\nhe did say a word or two that was more tender in its nature. \"You\nmust not be in dudgeon with me,\" he said, \"for speaking to you of all\nthis. Hitherto I have kept it all to myself, and perhaps I should\nstill have done so.\"\n\n\"Oh no; do not say that.\"\n\n\"I am in great grief. It is dreadful to me to hear these things said,\nand as yet I have found no sympathy.\"\n\n\"I can assure you, Mr. Mason, that I do sympathise with you most\nsincerely. I only wish my sympathy could be of more value.\"\n\n\"It will be invaluable,\" he said, not looking at her, but fixing his\neyes upon the fire, \"if it be given with constancy from the first to\nthe last of this sad affair.\"\n\n\"It shall be so given,\" said Miss Furnival, also looking at the fire.\n\n\"It will be tolerably long, and men will say cruel things of us. I\ncan foresee this, that it will be very hard to prove to the world\nwith certainty that there is no foundation whatever for these\ncharges. If those who are now most friendly to us turn away from\nus--\"\n\n\"I will never turn away from you, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Then give me your hand on that, and remember that such a promise\nin my ears means much.\" He in his excitement had forgotten that\nthere were others in the room who might be looking at them, and that\nthere was a vista open upon them direct from all the eyes at the\ncard-table; but she did not forget it. Miss Furnival could be very\nenthusiastic, but she was one of those who in her enthusiasm rarely\nforgot anything. Nevertheless, after a moment's pause, she gave him\nher hand. \"There it is,\" she said; \"and you may be sure of this, that\nwith me also such a promise does mean something. And now I will say\ngood night.\" And so, having received the pressure of her hand, she\nleft him.\n\n\"I will get you your candle,\" he said, and so he did.\n\n\"Good night, papa,\" she said, kissing her father. And then, with\na slight muttered word to Lady Staveley, she withdrew, having\nsacrificed the remainder of that evening for the sake of acceding to\nMr. Mason's request respecting her pledge. It could not be accounted\nstrange that she should give her hand to the gentleman with whom she\nwas immediately talking as she bade him good night.\n\n\"And now grandpapa is dead too,\" said Marian, \"and there's nobody\nleft but us three.\"\n\n\"And we'll divide,\" said Fanny Sebright; and so the game of commerce\nwas brought to an end.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nMONKTON GRANGE.\n\n\nDuring these days Peregrine Orme--though he was in love up to his\nvery chin, seriously in love, acknowledging this matter to himself\nopenly, pulling his hair in the retirement of his bedroom, and\nresolving that he would do that which he had hitherto in life always\nbeen successful in doing--ask, namely, boldly for that he wanted\nsorely--Peregrine Orme, I say, though he was in this condition, did\nnot in these days neglect his hunting. A proper attendance upon the\nproceedings of the H. H. was the only duty which he had hitherto\nundertaken in return for all that his grandfather had done for him,\nand I have no doubt that he conceived that he was doing a duty in\ngoing hither and thither about the county to their most distant\nmeets. At this period of the present season it happened that\nNoningsby was more central to the proceedings of the hunt than The\nCleeve, and therefore he was enabled to think that he was remaining\naway from home chiefly on business. On one point, however, he had\nstoutly come to a resolution. That question should be asked of\nMadeline Staveley before he returned to his grandfather's house.\n\nAnd now had arrived a special hunting morning,--special, because\nthe meet was in some degree a show meet, appropriate for ladies,\nat a comfortable distance from Noningsby, and affording a chance\nof amusement to those who sat in carriages as well as to those on\nhorseback. Monkton Grange was the well-known name of the place,\na name perhaps dearer to the ladies than to the gentlemen of the\ncountry, seeing that show meets do not always give the best sport.\nMonkton Grange is an old farm-house, now hardly used as such,\nhaving been left, as regards the habitation, in the hands of a head\nlabourer; but it still possesses the marks of ancient respectability\nand even of grandeur. It is approached from the high road by a long\ndouble avenue of elms, which still stand in all their glory. The road\nitself has become narrow, and the space between the side row of trees\nis covered by soft turf, up which those coming to the meet love to\ngallop, trying the fresh metal of their horses. And the old house\nitself is surrounded by a moat, dry indeed now for the most part, but\nnevertheless an evident moat, deep and well preserved, with a bridge\nover it which Fancy tells us must once have been a drawbridge. It\nis here, in front of the bridge, that the old hounds sit upon their\nhaunches, resting quietly round the horses of the huntsmen, while\nthe young dogs move about, and would wander if the whips allowed\nthem--one of the fairest sights to my eyes that this fair country\nof ours can show. And here the sportsmen and ladies congregate by\ndegrees, men from a distance in dog-carts generally arriving first,\nas being less able to calculate the time with accuracy. There is room\nhere too in the open space for carriages, and there is one spot on\nwhich always stands old Lord Alston's chariot with the four posters;\nan ancient sportsman he, who still comes to some few favourite meets;\nand though Alston Court is but eight miles from the Grange, the\npost-horses always look as though they had been made to do their\nbest, for his lordship likes to move fast even in his old age. He is\na tall thin man, bent much with age, and apparently too weak for much\nwalking; he is dressed from head to foot in a sportsman's garb, with\na broad stiffly starched coloured handkerchief tied rigidly round his\nneck. One would say that old as he is he has sacrificed in no way\nto comfort. It is with difficulty that he gets into his saddle, his\nservant holding his rein and stirrup and giving him perhaps some\nother slight assistance; but when he is there, there he will remain\nall day, and when his old blood warms he will gallop along the road\nwith as much hot fervour as his grandson. An old friend he of Sir\nPeregrine's. \"And why is not your grandfather here to-day?\" he said\non this occasion to young Orme. \"Tell him from me that if he fails\nus in this way, I shall think he is getting old.\" Lord Alston was in\ntruth five years older than Sir Peregrine, but Sir Peregrine at this\ntime was thinking of other things.\n\n[Illustration: Monkton Grange.]\n\nAnd then a very tidy little modern carriage bustled up the road,\na brougham made for a pair of horses which was well known to all\nhunting men in these parts. It was very unpretending in its colour\nand harness; but no vehicle more appropriate to its purpose ever\ncarried two thorough-going sportsmen day after day about the country.\nIn this as it pulled up under the head tree of the avenue were seated\nthe two Miss Tristrams. The two Miss Tristrams were well known to the\nHamworth Hunt--I will not merely say as fearless riders,--of most\ngirls who hunt as much can be said as that; but they were judicious\nhorsewomen; they knew when to ride hard, and when hard riding, as\nregarded any necessary for the hunt, would be absolutely thrown\naway. They might be seen for half the day moving about the roads as\nleisurely, or standing as quietly at the covert's side as might the\nseniors of the fields. But when the time for riding did come, when\nthe hounds were really running--when other young ladies had begun\nto go home--then the Miss Tristrams were always there;--there or\nthereabouts, as their admirers would warmly boast.\n\nNor did they commence their day's work as did other girls who came\nout on hunting mornings. With most such it is clear to see that the\nobject is pretty much the same here as in the ballroom. \"Spectatum\nveniunt; veniunt spectentur ut ips\u00c3\u00a6,\" as it is proper, natural, and\ndesirable that they should do. By that word \"spectatum\" I would wish\nto signify something more than the mere use of the eyes. Perhaps an\noccasional word dropped here and there into the ears of a cavalier\nmay be included in it; and the \"spectentur\" also may include a word\nso received. But the Miss Tristrams came for hunting. Perhaps there\nmight be a slight shade of affectation in the manner by which they\nwould appear to come for that and that only. They would talk of\nnothing else, at any rate during the earlier portion of the day, when\nmany listeners were by. They were also well instructed as to the\ncountry to be drawn, and usually had a word of import to say to the\nhuntsman. They were good-looking, fair-haired girls, short in size,\nwith bright gray eyes, and a short decisive mode of speaking. It must\nnot be imagined that they were altogether indifferent to such matters\nas are dear to the hearts of other girls. They were not careless as\nto admiration, and if report spoke truth of them were willing enough\nto establish themselves in the world; but all their doings of that\nkind had a reference to their favourite amusement, and they would as\nsoon have thought of flirting with men who did not hunt as some other\ngirls would with men who did not dance.\n\nI do not know that this kind of life had been altogether successful\nwith them, or that their father had been right to permit it. He\nhimself had formerly been a hunting man, but he had become fat and\nlazy, and the thing had dropped away from him. Occasionally he did\ncome out with them, but when he did not do so some other senior of\nthe field would have them nominally under charge; but practically\nthey were as independent when going across the country as the young\nmen who accompanied them. I have expressed a doubt whether this life\nwas successful with them, and indeed such doubt was expressed by many\nof their neighbours. It had been said of each of them for the last\nthree years that she was engaged, now to this man, and then to that\nother; but neither this man nor that other had yet made good the\nassertion, and now people were beginning to say that no man was\nengaged to either of them. Hunting young ladies are very popular\nin the hunting-field; I know no place in which girls receive more\nworship and attention; but I am not sure but they may carry their\nenthusiasm too far for their own interests, let their horsemanship be\nas perfect as it may be.\n\nThe two girls on this occasion sat in their carriage till the groom\nbrought up their horses, and then it was wonderful to see with what\nease they placed themselves in their saddles. On such occasions they\nadmitted no aid from the gentlemen around them, but each stepping\nfor an instant on a servant's hand, settled herself in a moment on\nhorseback. Nothing could be more perfect than the whole thing, but\nthe wonder was that Mr. Tristram should have allowed it.\n\nThe party from Noningsby consisted of six or seven on horseback,\nbesides those in the carriage. Among the former there were the two\nyoung ladies, Miss Furnival and Miss Staveley, and our friends Felix\nGraham, Augustus Staveley, and Peregrine Orme. Felix Graham was not\nby custom a hunting man, as he possessed neither time nor money for\nsuch a pursuit; but to-day he was mounted on his friend Staveley's\nsecond horse, having expressed his determination to ride him as long\nas they two, the man and the horse, could remain together.\n\n\"I give you fair warning,\" Felix had said, \"if I do not spare my own\nneck, you cannot expect me to spare your horse's legs.\"\n\n\"You may do your worst,\" Staveley had answered. \"If you give him his\nhead, and let him have his own way, he won't come to grief, whatever\nyou may do.\"\n\nOn their road to Monkton Grange, which was but three miles from\nNoningsby, Peregrine Orme had ridden by the side of Miss Staveley,\nthinking more of her than of the affairs of the hunt, prominent as\nthey were generally in his thoughts. How should he do it, and when,\nand in what way should he commence the deed? He had an idea that it\nmight be better for him if he could engender some closer intimacy\nbetween himself and Madeline before he absolutely asked the fatal\nquestion; but the closer intimacy did not seem to produce itself\nreadily. He had, in truth, known Madeline Staveley for many years,\nalmost since they were children together; but lately, during these\nChristmas holidays especially, there had not been between them that\nclose conversational alliance which so often facilitates such an\noverture as that which Peregrine was now desirous of making. And,\nworse again, he had seen that there was such close conversational\nalliance between Madeline and Felix Graham. He did not on that\naccount dislike the young barrister, or call him, even within his own\nbreast, a snob or an ass. He knew well that he was neither the one\nnor the other; but he knew as well that he could be no fit match\nfor Miss Staveley, and, to tell the truth, he did not suspect that\neither Graham or Miss Staveley would think of such a thing. It was\nnot jealousy that tormented him, so much as a diffidence in his\nown resources. He made small attempts which did not succeed, and\ntherefore he determined that he would at once make a grand attempt.\nHe would create himself an opportunity before he left Noningsby, and\nwould do it even to-day on horseback, if he could find sufficient\nopportunity. In taking a determined step like that, he knew that he\nwould not lack the courage.\n\n\"Do you mean to ride to-day,\" he said to Madeline, as they were\napproaching the bottom of the Grange avenue. For the last half-mile\nhe had been thinking what he would say to her, and thinking in\nvain; and now, at the last moment, he could summon no words to his\nassistance more potent for his purpose than these.\n\n\"If you mean by riding, Mr. Orme, going across the fields with you\nand the Miss Tristrams, certainly not. I should come to grief, as you\ncall it, at the first ditch.\"\n\n\"And that is just what I shall do,\" said Felix Graham, who was at her\nother side.\n\n\"Then, if you take my advice, you'll remain with us in the wood, and\nact as squire of dames. What on earth would Marian do if aught but\ngood was to befall you?\"\n\n\"Dear Marian! She gave me a special commission to bring her the fox's\ntail. Foxes' tails are just like ladies.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Mr. Graham. I've heard you make some pretty compliments,\nand that is about the prettiest.\"\n\n\"A faint heart will never win either the one or the other, Miss\nStaveley.\"\n\n\"Oh, ah, yes. That will do very well. Under these circumstances I\nwill accept the comparison.\"\n\nAll of which very innocent conversation was overheard by Peregrine\nOrme, riding on the other side of Miss Staveley's horse. And why not?\nNeither Graham nor Miss Staveley had any objection. But how was it\nthat he could not join in and take his share in it? He had made one\nlittle attempt at conversation, and that having failed he remained\nperfectly silent till they reached the large circle at the head of\nthe avenue. \"It's no use, this sort of thing,\" he said to himself. \"I\nmust do it at a blow, if I do it at all;\" and then he rode away to\nthe master of the hounds.\n\nAs our party arrived at the open space the Miss Tristrams were\nstepping out of their carriage, and they came up to shake hands with\nMiss Staveley.\n\n\"I am so glad to see you,\" said the eldest; \"it is so nice to have\nsome ladies out besides ourselves.\"\n\n\"Do keep up with us,\" said the second. \"It's a very open country\nabout here, and anybody can ride it.\" And then Miss Furnival was\nintroduced to them. \"Does your horse jump, Miss Furnival?\"\n\n\"I really do not know,\" said Sophia; \"but I sincerely trust that if\nhe does, he will refrain to-day.\"\n\n\"Don't say so,\" said the eldest sportswoman. \"If you'll only begin\nit will come as easy to you as going along the road;\" and then, not\nbeing able to spare more of these idle moments, they both went off to\ntheir horses, walking as though their habits were no impediments to\nthem, and in half a minute they were seated.\n\n\"What is Harriet on to-day?\" asked Staveley of a constant member of\nthe hunt. Now Harriet was the eldest Miss Tristram.\n\n\"A little brown mare she got last week. That was a terrible brush we\nhad on Friday. You weren't out, I think. We killed in the open, just\nat the edge of Rotherham Common. Harriet was one of the few that was\nup, and I don't think the chestnut horse will be the better of it\nthis season.\"\n\n\"That was the horse she got from Griggs?\"\n\n\"Yes; she gave a hundred and fifty for him; and I'm told he was as\nnearly done on Friday as any animal you ever put your eyes on. They\nsay Harriet cried when she got home.\" Now the gentleman who was\ntalking about Harriet on this occasion was one with whom she would no\nmore have sat down to table than with her own groom.\n\nBut though Harriet may have cried when she got home on that fatal\nFriday evening, she was full of the triumph of the hunt on this\nmorning. It is not often that the hounds run into a fox and\nabsolutely surround and kill him on the open ground, and when this\nis done after a severe run, there are seldom many there to see it.\nIf a man can fairly take a fox's brush on such an occasion as that,\nlet him do it; otherwise let him leave it to the huntsman. On the\noccasion in question it seems that Harriet Tristram might have done\nso, and some one coming second to her had been gallant enough to do\nit for her.\n\n\"Oh, my lord, you should have been out on Friday,\" she said to Lord\nAlston. \"We had the prettiest thing I ever saw.\"\n\n\"A great deal too pretty for me, my dear.\"\n\n\"Oh, you who know the roads so well would certainly have been up. I\nsuppose it was thirteen miles from Cobbleton's Bushes to Rotherham\nCommon.\"\n\n\"Not much less, indeed,\" said his lordship, unwilling to diminish the\nlady's triumph. Had a gentleman made the boast his lordship would\nhave demonstrated that it was hardly more than eleven.\n\n\"I timed it accurately from the moment he went away,\" said the lady,\n\"and it was exactly fifty-seven minutes. The first part of it was\nawfully fast. Then we had a little check at Moseley Bottom. But for\nthat, nobody could have lived through it. I never shall forget how\ndeep it was coming up from there to Cringleton. I saw two men get off\nto ease their horses up the deep bit of plough; and I would have done\nso too, only my horse would not have stood for me to get up.\"\n\n\"I hope he was none the worse for it,\" said the sporting character\nwho had been telling Staveley just now how she had cried when she got\nhome that night.\n\n\"To tell the truth, I fear it has done him no good. He would not\nfeed, you know, that night at all.\"\n\n\"And broke out into cold sweats,\" said the gentleman.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said the lady, not quite liking it, but still enduring\nwith patience.\n\n\"Rather groggy on his pins the next morning?\" suggested her friend.\n\n\"Very groggy,\" said Harriet, regarding the word as one belonging to\nfair sporting phraseology.\n\n\"And inclined to go very much on the points of his toes. I know all\nabout it, Miss Tristam, as well as though I'd seen him.\"\n\n\"There's nothing but rest for it, I suppose.\"\n\n\"Rest and regular exercise--that's the chief thing; and I should give\nhim a mash as often as three times a week. He'll be all right again\nin three or four weeks,--that is if he's sound, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, as sound as a bell,\" said Miss Tristram.\n\n\"He'll never be the same horse on a road though,\" said the sporting\ngentlemen, shaking his head and whispering to Staveley.\n\nAnd now the time had come at which they were to move. They always met\nat eleven; and at ten minutes past, to the moment, Jacob the huntsman\nwould summons the old hounds from off their haunches. \"I believe we\nmay be moving, Jacob,\" said Mr. Williams, the master.\n\n\"The time be up,\" said Jacob, looking at a ponderous timekeeper that\nmight with truth be called a hunting-watch; and then they all moved\nslowly away back from the Grange, down a farm-road which led to\nMonkton Wood, distant from the old house perhaps a quarter of a mile.\n\n\"May we go as far as the wood?\" said Miss Furnival to Augustus.\n\"Without being made to ride over hedges, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, yes; and ride about the wood half the day. It will be an\nhour and a half before a fox will break--even if he ever breaks.\"\n\n\"Dear me! how tired you will be of us. Now do say something pretty,\nMr. Staveley.\"\n\n\"It's not my _m\u00c3\u00a9tier_. We shall be tired, not of you, but of the\nthing. Galloping up and down the same cuts in the wood for an hour\nand a half is not exciting; nor does it improve the matter much if we\nstand still, as one should do by rights.\"\n\n\"That would be very slow.\"\n\n\"You need not be afraid. They never do here. Everybody will be\nrushing about as though the very world depended on their galloping.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad; that's just what I like.\"\n\n\"Everybody except Lord Alston, Miss Tristram, and, the other old\nstagers. They will husband their horses, and come out as fresh at\ntwo o'clock as though they were only just out. There is nothing so\nvaluable as experience in hunting.\"\n\n\"Do you think it nice seeing a young lady with so much hunting\nknowledge?\"\n\n\"Now you want me to talk slander, but I won't do it. I admire the\nMiss Tristrams exceedingly, and especially Julia.\"\n\n\"And which is Julia?\"\n\n\"The youngest; that one riding by herself.\"\n\n\"And why don't you go and express your admiration?\"\n\n\"Ah, me! why don't we all express the admiration that we feel, and\npour sweet praises into the ears of the lady that excites it? Because\nwe are cowards, Miss Furnival, and are afraid even of such a weak\nthing as a woman.\"\n\n\"Dear me! I should hardly have thought that you would suffer from\nsuch terror as that.\"\n\n\"Because you don't quite know me, Miss Furnival.\"\n\n\"And Miss Julia Tristram is the lady that has excited it?\"\n\n\"If it be not she, it is some other fair votary of Diana at present\nriding into Monkton Wood.\"\n\n\"Ah, now you are giving me a riddle to guess, and I never guess\nriddles. I won't even try at it. But they all seem to be stopping.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are putting the hounds into covert. Now if you want to\nshow yourself a good sportsman, look at your watch. You see that\nJulia Tristram has got hers in her hand.\"\n\n\"What's that for?\"\n\n\"To time the hounds; to see how long they'll be before they find.\nIt's very pretty work in a small gorse, but in a great wood like this\nI don't care much for being so accurate. But for heaven's sake don't\ntell Julia Tristram; I should not have a chance if she thought I was\nso slack.\"\n\nAnd now the hounds were scattering themselves in the wood, and the\nparty rode up the centre roadway towards a great circular opening in\nthe middle of it. Here it was the recognised practice of the horsemen\nto stand, and those who properly did their duty would stand there;\nbut very many lingered at the gate, knowing that there was but one\nother exit from the wood, without overcoming the difficulty of a very\nintricate and dangerous fence.\n\n\"There be a gap, bain't there?\" said one farmer to another, as they\nwere entering.\n\n\"Yes, there be a gap, and young Grubbles broke his 'orse's back a\ngetting over of it last year,\" said the second farmer.\n\n\"Did he though?\" said the first; and so they both remained at the\ngate.\n\nAnd others, a numerous body, including most of the ladies, galloped\nup and down the cross ways, because the master of the hounds and the\nhuntsman did so. \"D---- those fellows riding up and down after me\nwherever I go,\" said the master. \"I believe they think I'm to be\nhunted.\" This seemed to be said more especially to Miss Tristram, who\nwas always in the master's confidence; and I fear that the fellows\nalluded to included Miss Furnival and Miss Staveley.\n\nAnd then there came the sharp, eager sound of a hound's voice; a\nsingle, sharp, happy opening bark, and Harriet Tristram was the first\nto declare that the game was found. \"Just five minutes and twenty\nseconds, my lord,\" said Julia Tristram to Lord Alston. \"That's not\nbad in a large wood like this.\"\n\n\"Uncommonly good,\" said his lordship. \"And when are we to get out of\nit?\"\n\n\"They'll be here for the next hour, I'm afraid,\" said the lady, not\nmoving her horse from the place where she stood, though many of the\nmore impetuous of the men were already rushing away to the gates.\n\"I have seen a fox go away from here without resting a minute; but\nthat was later in the season, at the end of February. Foxes are away\nfrom home then.\" All which observations showed a wonderfully acute\nsporting observation on the part of Miss Tristram.\n\nAnd then the music of the dogs became fast and frequent, as they\ndrove the brute across and along from one part of the large wood to\nanother. Sure there is no sound like it for filling a man's heart\nwith an eager desire to be at work. What may be the trumpet in battle\nI do not know, but I can imagine that it has the same effect. And\nnow a few of them were standing on that wide circular piece of grass,\nwhen a sound the most exciting of them all reached their ears. \"He's\naway!\" shouted a whip from a corner of the wood. The good-natured\nbeast, though as yet it was hardly past Christmas-time, had consented\nto bless at once so many anxious sportsmen, and had left the back of\nthe covert with the full pack at his heels.\n\n\"There is no gate that way, Miss Tristram,\" said a gentleman.\n\n\"There's a double ditch and bank that will do as well,\" said she, and\naway she went directly after the hounds, regardless altogether of the\ngates. Peregrine Orme and Felix Graham, who were with her, followed\nclose upon her track.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nBREAKING COVERT.\n\n\n\"There's a double ditch and bank that will do as well,\" Miss Tristram\nhad said when she was informed that there was no gate out of the\nwood at the side on which the fox had broken. The gentleman who had\ntendered the information might as well have held his tongue, for Miss\nTristram knew the wood intimately, was acquainted with the locality\nof all its gates, and was acquainted also with the points at which it\nmight be left, without the assistance of any gate at all, by those\nwho were well mounted and could ride their horses. Therefore she had\nthus replied, \"There's a double ditch and bank that will do as well.\"\nAnd for the double ditch and bank at the end of one of the grassy\nroadways Miss Tristram at once prepared herself.\n\n\"That's the gap where Grubbles broke his horse's back,\" said a man in\na red coat to Peregrine Orme, and so saying he made up his wavering\nmind and galloped away as fast as his nag could carry him. But\nPeregrine Orme would not avoid a fence at which a lady was not afraid\nto ride; and Felix Graham, knowing little but fearing nothing,\nfollowed Peregrine Orme.\n\nAt the end of the roadway, in the middle of the track, there was the\ngap. For a footman it was doubtless the easiest way over the fence,\nfor the ditch on that side was half filled up, and there was space\nenough left of the half-broken bank for a man's scrambling feet; but\nMiss Tristram at once knew that it was a bad place for a horse. The\nsecond or further ditch was the really difficult obstacle, and there\nwas no footing in the gap from which a horse could take his leap. To\nthe right of this the fence was large and required a good horse, but\nMiss Tristram knew her animal and was accustomed to large fences. The\ntrained beast went well across on to the bank, poised himself there\nfor a moment, and taking a second spring carried his mistress across\ninto the further field apparently with ease. In that field the dogs\nwere now running, altogether, so that a sheet might have covered\nthem; and Miss Tristram, exulting within her heart and holding in her\nhorse, knew that she had got away uncommonly well.\n\nPeregrine Orme followed,--a little to the right of the lady's\npassage, so that he might have room for himself, and do no mischief\nin the event of Miss Tristram or her horse making any mistake at\nthe leap. He also got well over. But, alas! in spite of such early\nsuccess he was destined to see nothing of the hunt that day! Felix\nGraham, thinking that he would obey instructions by letting his horse\ndo as he pleased, permitted the beast to come close upon Orme's track\nand to make his jump before Orme's horse had taken his second spring.\n\n\"Have a care,\" said Peregrine, feeling that the two were together on\nthe bank, \"or you'll shove me into the ditch.\" He however got well\nover.\n\nFelix, attempting to \"have a care\" just when his doing so could be\nof no avail, gave his horse a pull with the curb as he was preparing\nfor his second spring. The outside ditch was broad and deep and well\nbanked up, and required that an animal should have all his power. It\nwas at such a moment as this that he should have been left to do his\nwork without injudicious impediment from his rider. But poor Graham\nwas thinking only of Orme's caution, and attempted to stop the beast\nwhen any positive and absolute stop was out of the question. The\nhorse made his jump, and, crippled as he was, jumped short. He came\nwith his knees against the further bank, threw his rider, and then in\nhis struggle to right himself rolled over him.\n\nFelix felt at once that he was much hurt--that he had indeed come to\ngrief; but still he was not stunned nor did he lose his presence of\nmind. The horse succeeded in gaining his feet, and then Felix also\njumped up and even walked a step or two towards the head of the\nanimal with the object of taking the reins. But he found that he\ncould not raise his arm, and he found also that he could hardly\nbreathe.\n\nBoth Peregrine and Miss Tristram looked back. \"There's nothing\nwrong I hope,\" said the lady; and then she rode on. And let it be\nunderstood that in hunting those who are in advance generally do\nride on. The lame and the halt and the wounded, if they cannot pick\nthemselves up, have to be picked up by those who come after them. But\nPeregrine saw that there was no one else coming that way. The memory\nof young Grubbles' fate had placed an interdict on that pass out\nof the wood, which nothing short of the pluck and science of Miss\nTristram was able to disregard. Two cavaliers she had carried with\nher. One she had led on to instant slaughter, and the other remained\nto look after his fallen brother-in-arms. Miss Tristram in the mean\ntime was in the next field and had settled well down to her work.\n\n\"Are you hurt, old fellow?\" said Peregrine, turning back his horse,\nbut still not dismounting.\n\n\"Not much, I think,\" said Graham, smiling. \"There's something wrong\nabout my arm,--but don't you wait.\" And then he found that he spoke\nwith difficulty.\n\n\"Can you mount again?\"\n\n\"I don't think I'll mind that. Perhaps I'd better sit down.\" Then\nPeregrine Orme knew that Graham was hurt, and jumping off his own\nhorse he gave up all hope of the hunt.\n\n\"Here, you fellow, come and hold these horses.\" So invoked, a boy who\nin following the sport had got as far as this ditch did as he was\nbid, and scrambled over. \"Sit down, Graham: there; I'm afraid you\nare hurt. Did he roll on you?\" But Felix merely looked up into his\nface,--still smiling. He was now very pale, and for the moment could\nnot speak. Peregrine came close to him, and gently attempted to raise\nthe wounded limb; whereupon Graham shuddered, and shook his head.\n\n\"I fear it is broken,\" said Peregrine. Graham nodded his head, and\nraised his left hand to his breast; and Peregrine then knew that\nsomething else was amiss also.\n\nI don't know any feeling more disagreeable than that produced by\nbeing left alone in a field, when out hunting, with a man who has\nbeen very much hurt and who is incapable of riding or walking.\nThe hurt man himself has the privilege of his infirmities and may\nremain quiescent; but you, as his only attendant, must do something.\nYou must for the moment do all, and if you do wrong the whole\nresponsibility lies on your shoulders. If you leave a wounded man on\nthe damp ground, in the middle of winter, while you run away, five\nmiles perhaps, to the next doctor, he may not improbably--as you\nthen think--be dead before you come back. You don't know the way;\nyou are heavy yourself, and your boots are very heavy. You must stay\ntherefore; but as you are no doctor you don't in the least know what\nis the amount of the injury. In your great trouble you begin to roar\nfor assistance; but the woods re-echo your words, and the distant\nsound of the huntsman's horn, as he summons his hounds at a check,\nonly mocks your agony.\n\nBut Peregrine had a boy with him. \"Get upon that horse,\" he said at\nlast; \"ride round to Farmer Griggs, and tell them to send somebody\nhere with a spring cart. He has got a spring cart I know;--and a\nmattress in it.\"\n\n\"But I hain't no gude at roiding like,\" said the boy, looking with\ndismay at Orme's big horse.\n\n\"Then run; that will be better, for you can go through the wood. You\nknow where Farmer Griggs lives. The first farm the other side of the\nGrange.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, I knows where Farmer Griggs lives well enough.\"\n\n\"Run, then; and if the cart is here in half an hour I'll give you a\nsovereign.\"\n\nInspirited by the hopes of such wealth, golden wealth, wealth for a\nlifetime, the boy was quickly back over the fence, and Peregrine was\nleft alone with Felix Graham. He was now sitting down, with his feet\nhanging into the ditch, and Peregrine was kneeling behind him. \"I am\nsorry I can do nothing more,\" said he; \"but I fear we must remain\nhere till the cart comes.\"\n\n\"I am--so--vexed--about your hunt,\" said Felix, gasping as he spoke.\nHe had in fact broken his right arm which had been twisted under him\nas the horse rolled, and two of his ribs had been staved in by the\npommel of his saddle. Many men have been worse hurt and have hunted\nagain before the end of the season, but the fracture of three bones\ndoes make a man uncomfortable for the time. \"Now the cart--is--sent\nfor, couldn't you--go on?\" But it was not likely that Peregrine Orme\nwould do that. \"Never mind me,\" he said. \"When a fellow is hurt he\nhas always to do as he's told. You'd better have a drop of sherry.\nLook here: I've got a flask at my saddle. There; you can support\nyourself with that arm a moment. Did you ever see horses stand so\nquiet. I've got hold of yours, and now I'll fasten them together. I\nsay, Whitefoot, you don't kick, do you?\" And then he contrived to\npicket the horses to two branches, and having got out his case of\nsherry, poured a small modicum into the silver mug which was attached\nto the apparatus and again supported Graham while he drank. \"You'll\nbe as right as a trivet by-and-by; only you'll have to make Noningsby\nyour headquarters for the next six weeks.\" And then the same idea\npassed through the mind of each of them;--how little a man need be\npitied for such a misfortune if Madeline Staveley would consent to be\nhis nurse.\n\n[Illustration: Felix Graham in trouble.]\n\nNo man could have less surgical knowledge than Peregrine Orme, but\nnevertheless he was such a man as one would like to have with him if\none came to grief in such a way. He was cheery and up-hearted, but at\nthe same time gentle and even thoughtful. His voice was pleasant and\nhis touch could be soft. For many years afterwards Felix remembered\nhow that sherry had been held to his lips, and how the young heir of\nThe Cleeve had knelt behind him in his red coat, supporting him as he\nbecame weary with waiting, and saying pleasant words to him through\nthe whole. Felix Graham was a man who would remember such things.\n\nIn running through the wood the boy first encountered three horsemen.\nThey were the judge, with his daughter Madeline and Miss Furnival.\n\"There be a mon there who be a'most dead,\" said the boy, hardly able\nto speak from want of breath. \"I be agoing for Farmer Griggs' cart.\"\nAnd then they stopped him a moment to ask for some description, but\nthe boy could tell them nothing to indicate that the wounded man\nwas one of their friends. It might however be Augustus, and so the\nthree rode on quickly towards the fence, knowing nothing of the\ncircumstances of the ditches which would make it out of their power\nto get to the fallen sportsman.\n\nBut Peregrine heard the sound of the horses and the voices of the\nhorsemen. \"By Jove, there's a lot of them coming down here,\" said he.\n\"It's the judge and two of the girls. Oh, Miss Staveley, I'm so glad\nyou've come. Graham has had a bad fall and hurt himself. You haven't\na shawl, have you? the ground is so wet under him.\"\n\n\"It doesn't signify at all,\" said Felix, looking round and seeing the\nfaces of his friends on the other side of the bank.\n\nMadeline Staveley gave a slight shriek which her father did not\nnotice, but which Miss Furnival heard very plainly. \"Oh papa,\" she\nsaid, \"cannot you get over to him?\" And then she began to bethink\nherself whether it were possible that she should give up something of\nher dress to protect the man who was hurt from the damp muddy ground\non which he lay.\n\n\"Can you hold my horse, dear,\" said the judge, slowly dismounting;\nfor the judge, though he rode every day on sanitary considerations,\nhad not a sportsman's celerity in leaving and recovering his saddle.\nBut he did get down, and burdened as he was with a great-coat, he\ndid succeed in crossing that accursed fence. Accursed it was from\nhenceforward in the annals of the H. H., and none would ride it but\ndare-devils who professed themselves willing to go at anything.\nMiss Tristram, however, always declared that there was nothing in\nit--though she avoided it herself, whispering to her friends that she\nhad led others to grief there, and might possibly do so again if she\npersevered.\n\n\"Could you hold the horse?\" said Madeline to Miss Furnival; \"and I\nwill go for a shawl to the carriage.\" Miss Furnival declared that to\nthe best of her belief she could not, but nevertheless the animal was\nleft with her, and Madeline turned round and galloped back towards\nthe carriage. She made her horse do his best though her eyes were\nnearly blinded with tears, and went straight on for the carriage,\nthough she would have given much for a moment to hide those tears\nbefore she reached it.\n\n\"Oh, mamma! give me a thick shawl; Mr. Graham has hurt himself in the\nfield, and is lying on the grass.\" And then in some incoherent and\nquick manner she had to explain what she knew of the accident before\nshe could get a carriage-cloak out of the carriage. This, however,\nshe did succeed in doing, and in some manner, very unintelligible\nto herself afterwards, she did gallop back with her burden. She\npassed the cloak over to Peregrine, who clambered up the bank to get\nit, while the judge remained on the ground, supporting the young\nbarrister. Felix Graham, though he was weak, was not stunned or\nsenseless, and he knew well who it was that had procured for him that\ncomfort.\n\nAnd then the carriage followed Madeline, and there was quite a\nconcourse of servants and horses and ladies on the inside of the\nfence. But the wounded man was still unfortunately on the other side.\nNo cart from Farmer Griggs made its appearance, though it was now\nmore than half an hour since the boy had gone. Carts, when they are\nwanted in such sudden haste, do not make their appearance. It was two\nmiles through the wood to Mr. Griggs's farm-yard, and more than three\nmiles back by any route which the cart could take. And then it might\nbe more than probable that in Farmer Griggs's establishment there was\nnot always a horse ready in harness, or a groom at hand prepared to\nyoke him. Peregrine had become very impatient, and had more than once\ninvoked a silent anathema on the farmer's head; but nevertheless\nthere was no appearance of the cart.\n\n\"We must get him across the ditches into the carriage,\" said the\njudge.\n\n\"If Lady Staveley will let us do that,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"The difficulty is not with Lady Staveley but with these nasty\nditches,\" said the judge, for he had been up to his knees in one of\nthem, and the water had penetrated his boots. But the task was at\nlast done. Mrs. Arbuthnot stood up on the back seat of the carriage\nso that she might hold the horses, and the coachman and footman got\nacross into the field. \"It would be better to let me lie here all\nday,\" said Felix, as three of them struggled back with their burden,\nthe judge bringing up the rear with two hunting-whips and Peregrine's\ncap. \"How on earth any one would think of riding over such a place as\nthat!\" said the judge. But then, when he had been a young man it had\nnot been the custom for barristers to go out hunting.\n\nMadeline, as she saw the wounded man carefully laid on the back seat\nof the carriage, almost wished that she could have her mother's place\nthat she might support him. Would they be careful enough with him?\nWould they remember how terrible must be the pain of that motion to\none so hurt as he was? And then she looked into his face as he was\nmade to lean back, and she saw that he still smiled. Felix Graham was\nby no means a handsome man; I should hardly sin against the truth if\nI were to say that he was ugly. But Madeline, as she looked at him\nnow lying there utterly without colour but always with that smile on\nhis countenance, thought that no face to her liking had ever been\nmore gracious. She still rode close to him as they went down the\ngrassy road, saying never a word. And Miss Furnival rode there also,\nsomewhat in the rear, condoling with the judge as to his wet feet.\n\n\"Miss Furnival,\" he said, \"when a judge forgets himself and goes out\nhunting he has no right to expect anything better. What would your\nfather have said had he seen me clambering up the bank with young\nOrme's hunting-cap between my teeth? I positively did.\"\n\n\"He would have rushed to assist you,\" said Miss Furnival, with a\nlittle burst of enthusiasm which was hardly needed on the occasion.\nAnd then Peregrine came after them leading Graham's horse. He had\nbeen compelled to return to the field and ride both the horses back\ninto the wood; one after the other, while the footman held them. That\nriding back over fences in cold blood is the work that really tries\na man's nerve. And a man has to do it too when no one is looking on.\nHow he does crane and falter and look about for an easy place at such\na moment as that! But when the blood is cold, no places are easy.\n\nThe procession got back to Noningsby without adventure, and Graham\nas a matter of course was taken up to his bed. One of the servants\nhad been despatched to Alston for a surgeon, and in an hour or\ntwo the extent of the misfortune was known. The right arm was\nbroken--\"very favourably,\" as the doctor observed. But two ribs were\nbroken--\"rather unfavourably.\" There was some talk of h\u00c3\u00a6morrhage and\ninward wounds, and Sir Jacob from Saville Row was suggested by Lady\nStaveley. But the judge, knowing the extent of Graham's means, made\nsome further preliminary inquiries, and it was considered that Sir\nJacob would not be needed--at any rate not as yet.\n\n\"Why don't they send for him?\" said Madeline to her mother with\nrather more than her wonted energy.\n\n\"Your papa does not think it necessary, my dear. It would be very\nexpensive, you know.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, would you let a man die because it would cost a few\npounds to cure him?\"\n\n\"My dear, we all hope that Mr. Graham won't die--at any rate not at\npresent. If there be any danger you may be sure that your papa will\nsend for the best advice.\"\n\nBut Madeline was by no means satisfied. She could not understand\neconomy in a matter of life and death. If Sir Jacob's coming would\nhave cost fifty pounds, or a hundred, what would that have signified,\nweighed in such a balance? Such a sum would be nothing to her father.\nHad Augustus fallen and broken his arm all the Sir Jacobs in London\nwould not have been considered too costly could their joint coming\nhave mitigated any danger. She did not however dare to speak to her\nmother again, so she said a word or two to Peregrine Orme, who was\nconstant in his attendance on Felix. Peregrine had been very kind,\nand she had seen it, and her heart therefore warmed towards him.\n\n\"Don't you think he ought to have more advice, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"Well, no; I don't know. He's very jolly, you know; only he can't\ntalk. One of the bones ran into him, but I believe he's all right.\"\n\n\"Oh, but that is so frightful!\" and the tears were again in her eyes.\n\n\"If I were him I should think one doctor enough. But it's easy enough\nhaving a fellow down from London, you know, if you like it.\"\n\n\"If he should get worse, Mr. Orme--.\" And then Peregrine made her a\nsort of promise, but in doing so an idea shot through his poor heart\nof what the truth might really be. He went back and looked at Felix\nwho was sleeping. \"If it is so I must bear it,\" he said to himself;\n\"but I'll fight it on;\" and a quick thought ran through his brain of\nhis own deficiencies. He knew that he was not clever and bright in\ntalk like Felix Graham. He could not say the right thing at the right\nmoment without forethought. How he wished that he could! But still he\nwould fight it on, as he would have done any losing match,--to the\nlast. And then he sat down by Felix's head, and resolved that he\nwould be loyal to his new friend all the same--loyal in all things\nneedful. But still he would fight it on.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nANOTHER FALL.\n\n\nFelix Graham had plenty of nurses, but Madeline was not one of them.\nAugustus Staveley came home while the Alston doctor was still busy\nat the broken bones, and of course he would not leave his friend. He\nwas one of those who had succeeded in the hunt, and consequently had\nheard nothing of the accident till the end of it. Miss Tristram had\nbeen the first to tell him that Mr. Graham had fallen in leaving the\ncovert, but having seen him rise to his legs she had not thought he\nwas seriously hurt.\n\n\"I do not know much about your friend,\" she had said; \"but I think I\nmay comfort you by an assurance that your horse is none the worse. I\ncould see as much as that.\"\n\n\"Poor Felix!\" said, Staveley. \"He has lost a magnificent run. I\nsuppose we are nine or ten miles from Monkton Grange now?\"\n\n\"Eleven if we are a yard,\" said the lady. \"It was an ugly country,\nbut the pace was nothing wonderful.\" And then others dropped in, and\nat last came tidings about Graham. At first there was a whisper that\nhe was dead. He had ridden over Orme, it was said; had nearly killed\nhim, and had quite killed himself. Then the report became less fatal.\nBoth horses were dead, but Graham was still living though with most\nof his bones broken.\n\n\"Don't believe it,\" said Miss Tristram. \"In what condition Mr. Graham\nmay be I won't say; but that your horse was safe and sound after he\ngot over the fence, of that you may take my word.\" And thus, in a\nstate of uncertainty, obtaining fresh rumours from every person he\npassed, Staveley hurried home. \"Right arm and two ribs,\" Peregrine\nsaid to him, as he met him in the hall. \"Is that all?\" said Augustus.\nIt was clear therefore that he did not think so much about it as his\nsister.\n\n\"If you'd let her have her head she'd never have come down like\nthat,\" Augustus said, as he sat that evening by his friend's bedside.\n\n\"But he pulled off, I fancy, to avoid riding over me,\" said\nPeregrine.\n\n\"Then he must have come too quick at his leap,\" said Augustus. \"You\nshould have steadied him as he came to it.\" From all which Graham\nperceived that a man cannot learn how to ride any particular horse by\ntwo or three words of precept.\n\n\"If you talk any more about the horse, or the hunt, or the accident,\nneither of you shall stay in the room,\" said Lady Staveley, who came\nin at that moment. But they both did stay in the room, and said a\ngreat deal more about the hunt, and the horse, and the accident\nbefore they left it; and even became so far reconciled to the\ncircumstance that they had a hot glass of brandy and water each,\nsitting by Graham's fire.\n\n\"But, Augustus, do tell me how he is,\" Madeline said to her brother,\nas she caught him going to his room. She had become ashamed of asking\nany more questions of her mother.\n\n\"He's all right; only he'll be as fretful as a porcupine, shut up\nthere. At least I should be. Are there lots of novels in the house?\nMind you send for a batch to-morrow. Novels are the only chance a man\nhas when he's laid up like that.\" Before breakfast on the following\nmorning Madeline had sent off to the Alston circulating library a\nlist of all the best new novels of which she could remember the\nnames.\n\nNo definite day had hitherto been fixed for Peregrine's return to\nThe Cleeve, and under the present circumstances he still remained at\nNoningsby assisting to amuse Felix Graham. For two days after the\naccident such seemed to be his sole occupation; but in truth he was\nlooking for an opportunity to say a word or two to Miss Staveley, and\npaving his way as best he might for that great speech which he was\nfully resolved that he would make before he left the house. Once or\ntwice he bethought himself whether he would not endeavour to secure\nfor himself some confidant in the family, and obtain the sanction and\nspecial friendship either of Madeline's mother, or her sister, or her\nbrother. But what if after that she should reject him? Would it not\nbe worse for him then that any one should have known of his defeat?\nHe could, as he thought, endure to suffer alone; but on such a matter\nas that pity would be unendurable. So as he sat there by Graham's\nfireside, pretending to read one of poor Madeline's novels for the\nsake of companionship, he determined that he would tell no one of his\nintention;--no one till he could make the opportunity for telling\nher.\n\nAnd when he did meet her, and find, now and again, some moment for\nsaying a word alone to her, she was very gracious to him. He had been\nso kind and gentle with Felix, there was so much in him that was\nsweet and good and honest, so much that such an event as this brought\nforth and made manifest, that Madeline, and indeed the whole family,\ncould not but be gracious to him. Augustus would declare that he was\nthe greatest brick he had ever known, repeating all Graham's words as\nto the patience with which the embryo baronet had knelt behind him on\nthe cold muddy ground, supporting him for an hour, till the carriage\nhad come up. Under such circumstances how could Madeline refrain from\nbeing gracious to him?\n\n\"But it is all from favour to Graham!\" Peregrine would say to himself\nwith bitterness; and yet though he said so he did not quite believe\nit. Poor fellow! It was all from favour to Graham. And could he have\nthoroughly believed the truth of those words which he repeated to\nhimself so often, he might have spared himself much pain. He might\nhave spared himself much pain, and possibly some injury; for if aught\ncould now tend to mature in Madeline's heart an affection which was\nbut as yet nascent, it would be the offer of some other lover. But\nsuch reasoning on the matter was much too deep for Peregrine Orme.\n\"It may be,\" he said to himself, \"that she only pities him because he\nis hurt. If so, is not this time better for me than any other? If it\nbe that she loves him, let me know it, and be out of my pain.\" It did\nnot then occur to him that circumstances such as those in question\ncould not readily be made explicit;--that Madeline might refuse\nhis love, and yet leave him no wiser than he now was as to her\nreasons for so refusing;--perhaps, indeed, leave him less wise, with\nincreased cause for doubt and hopeless hope, and the green melancholy\nof a rejected lover.\n\nMadeline during these two days said no more about the London doctor;\nbut it was plain to all who watched her that her anxiety as to the\npatient was much more keen than that of the other ladies of the\nhouse. \"She always thinks everybody is going to die,\" Lady Staveley\nsaid to Miss Furnival, intending, not with any consummate prudence,\nto account to that acute young lady for her daughter's solicitude.\n\"We had a cook here, three months since, who was very ill, and\nMadeline would never be easy till the doctor assured her that the\npoor woman's danger was altogether past.\"\n\n\"She is so very warm-hearted,\" said Miss Furnival in reply. \"It is\nquite delightful to see her. And she will have such pleasure when she\nsees him come down from his room.\"\n\nLady Staveley on this immediate occasion said nothing to her\ndaughter, but Mrs. Arbuthnot considered that a sisterly word might\nperhaps be spoken in due season.\n\n\"The doctor says he is doing quite well now,\" Mrs. Arbuthnot said to\nher, as they were sitting alone.\n\n\"But does he indeed? Did you hear him?\" said Madeline, who was\nsuspicious.\n\n\"He did so, indeed. I heard him myself. But he says also that he\nought to remain here, at any rate for the next fortnight,--if mamma\ncan permit it without inconvenience.\"\n\n\"Of course she can permit it. No one would turn any person out of\ntheir house in such a condition as that!\"\n\n\"Papa and mamma both will be very happy that he should stay here;--of\ncourse they would not do what you call turning him out. But, Mad,\nmy darling,\"--and then she came up close and put her arm round\nher sister's waist. \"I think mamma would be more comfortable in\nhis remaining here if your charity towards him were--what shall I\nsay?--less demonstrative.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Isabella?\"\n\n\"Dearest, dearest; you must not be angry with me. Nobody has hinted\nto me a word on the subject, nor do I mean to hint anything that can\npossibly be hurtful to you.\"\n\n\"But what do you mean?\"\n\n\"Don't you know, darling? He is a young man--and--and--people see\nwith such unkind eyes, and hear with such scandal-loving ears. There\nis that Miss Furnival--\"\n\n\"If Miss Furnival can think such things, I for one do not care what\nshe thinks.\"\n\n\"No, nor do I;--not as regards any important result. But may it not\nbe well to be careful? You know what I mean, dearest?\"\n\n\"Yes--I know. At least I suppose so. And it makes me know also how\nvery cold and shallow and heartless people are! I won't ask any more\nquestions, Isabella; but I can't know that a fellow-creature is\nsuffering in the house,--and a person like him too, so clever, whom\nwe all regard as a friend,--the most intimate friend in the world\nthat Augustus has,--and the best too, as I heard papa himself\nsay--without caring whether he is going to live or die.\"\n\n\"There is no danger now, you know.\"\n\n\"Very well; I am glad to hear it. Though I know very well that there\nmust be danger after such a terrible accident as that.\"\n\n\"The doctor says there is none.\"\n\n\"At any rate I will not--\" And then instead of finishing her sentence\nshe turned away her head and put up her handkerchief to wipe away a\ntear.\n\n\"You are not angry with me, dear?\" said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Madeline; and then they parted.\n\nFor some days after that Madeline asked no question whatever about\nFelix Graham, but it may be doubted whether this did not make the\nmatter worse. Even Sophia Furnival would ask how he was at any rate\ntwice a day, and Lady Staveley continued to pay him regular visits\nat stated intervals. As he got better she would sit with him, and\nbrought back reports as to his sayings. But Madeline never discussed\nany of these; and refrained alike from the conversation, whether\nhis broken bones or his unbroken wit were to be the subject of it.\nAnd then Mrs. Arbuthnot, knowing that she would still be anxious,\ngave her private bulletins as to the state of the sick man's\nprogress;--all which gave an air of secrecy to the matter, and caused\neven Madeline to ask herself why this should be so.\n\nOn the whole I think that Mrs. Arbuthnot was wrong. Mrs. Arbuthnot\nand the whole Staveley family would have regarded a mutual attachment\nbetween Mr. Graham and Madeline as a great family misfortune. The\njudge was a considerate father to his children, holding that a\nfather's control should never be brought to bear unnecessarily. In\nlooking forward to the future prospects of his sons and daughters\nit was his theory that they should be free to choose their life's\ncompanions for themselves. But nevertheless it could not be agreeable\nto him that his daughter should fall in love with a man who had\nnothing, and whose future success at his own profession seemed to be\nso very doubtful. On the whole I think that Mrs. Arbuthnot was wrong,\nand that the feeling that did exist in Madeline's bosom might more\npossibly have died away, had no word been said about it--even by a\nsister.\n\nAnd then another event happened which forced her to look into her\nown heart. Peregrine Orme did make his proposal. He waited patiently\nduring those two or three days in which the doctor's visits were\nfrequent, feeling that he could not talk about himself while any\nsense of danger pervaded the house. But then at last a morning came\non which the surgeon declared that he need not call again till\nthe morrow; and Felix himself, when the medical back was turned,\nsuggested that it might as well be to-morrow week. He began also to\nscold his friends, and look bright about the eyes, and drink his\nglass of sherry in a pleasant dinner-table fashion, not as if he were\nswallowing his physic. And Peregrine, when he saw all this, resolved\nthat the moment had come for the doing of his deed of danger. The\ntime would soon come at which he must leave Noningsby, and he would\nnot leave Noningsby till he had learned his fate.\n\nLady Staveley, who with a mother's eye had seen her daughter's\nsolicitude for Felix Graham's recovery,--had seen it, and\nanimadverted on it to herself,--had seen also, or at any rate had\nsuspected, that Peregrine Orme looked on her daughter with favouring\neyes. Now Peregrine Orme would have satisfied Lady Staveley as a\nson-in-law. She liked his ways and manners of thought--in spite of\nthose rumours as to the rat-catching which had reached her ears. She\nregarded him as quite clever enough to be a good husband, and no\ndoubt appreciated the fact that he was to inherit his title and The\nCleeve from an old grandfather instead of a middle-aged father. She\ntherefore had no objection to leave Peregrine alone with her one\newe-lamb, and therefore the opportunity which he sought was at last\nfound.\n\n\"I shall be leaving Noningsby to-morrow, Miss Staveley,\" he said one\nday, having secured an interview in the back drawing-room--in that\nhappy half-hour which occurs in winter before the world betakes\nitself to dress. Now I here profess my belief, that out of every\nten set offers made by ten young lovers, nine of such offers are\ncommenced with an intimation that the lover is going away. There is\na dash of melancholy in such tidings well suited to the occasion. If\nthere be any spark of love on the other side it will be elicited by\nthe idea of a separation. And then, also, it is so frequently the\nactual fact. This making of an offer is in itself a hard piece of\nbusiness,--a job to be postponed from day to day. It is so postponed,\nand thus that dash of melancholy, and that idea of separation are\nbrought in at the important moment with so much appropriate truth.\n\n\"I shall be leaving Noningsby to-morrow, Miss Staveley,\" Peregrine\nsaid.\n\n\"Oh dear! we shall be so sorry. But why are you going? What will Mr.\nGraham and Augustus do without you? You ought to stay at least till\nMr. Graham can leave his room.\"\n\n\"Poor Graham!--not that I think he is much to be pitied either; but\nhe won't be about for some weeks to come yet.\"\n\n\"You do not think he is worse; do you?\"\n\n\"Oh, dear, no; not at all.\" And Peregrine was unconsciously irritated\nagainst his friend by the regard which her tone evinced. \"He is quite\nwell; only they will not let him be moved. But, Miss Staveley, it was\nnot of Mr. Graham that I was going to speak.\"\n\n\"No--only I thought he would miss you so much.\" And then she blushed,\nthough the blush in the dark of the evening was lost upon him. She\nremembered that she was not to speak about Felix Graham's health, and\nit almost seemed as though Mr. Orme had rebuked her for doing so in\nsaying that he had not come there to speak of him.\n\n\"Lady Staveley's house has been turned up side down since this\naffair, and it is time now that some part of the trouble should\ncease.\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma does not mind it at all.\"\n\n\"I know how good she is; but nevertheless, Miss Staveley, I must go\nto-morrow.\" And then he paused a moment before he spoke again. \"It\nwill depend entirely upon you,\" he said, \"whether I may have the\nhappiness of returning soon to Noningsby.\"\n\n\"On me, Mr. Orme!\"\n\n\"Yes, on you. I do not know how to speak properly that which I have\nto say; but I believe I may as well say it out at once. I have come\nhere now to tell you that I love you and to ask you to be my wife.\"\nAnd then he stopped as though there were nothing more for him to say\nupon the matter.\n\nIt would be hardly extravagant to declare that Madeline's breath was\ntaken away by the very sudden manner in which young Orme had made his\nproposition. It had never entered her head that she had an admirer in\nhim. Previously to Graham's accident she had thought nothing about\nhim. Since that event she had thought about him a good deal; but\naltogether as of a friend of Graham's. He had been good and kind to\nGraham, and therefore she had liked him and had talked to him. He\nhad never said a word to her that had taught her to regard him as\na possible lover; and now that he was an actual lover, a declared\nlover standing before her, waiting for an answer, she was so\nastonished that she did not know how to speak. All her ideas too,\nas to love,--such ideas as she had ever formed, were confounded by\nhis abruptness. She would have thought, had she brought herself\nabsolutely to think upon it, that all speech of love should be very\ndelicate; that love should grow slowly, and then be whispered softly,\ndoubtingly, and with infinite care. Even had she loved him, or had\nshe been in the way towards loving him, such violence as this would\nhave frightened her and scared her love away. Poor Peregrine! His\nintentions had been so good and honest! He was so true and hearty,\nand free from all conceit in the matter! It was a pity that he should\nhave marred his cause by such ill judgment.\n\nBut there he stood waiting an answer,--and expecting it to be as\nopen, definite, and plain as though he had asked her to take a walk\nwith him. \"Madeline,\" he said, stretching out his hand when he\nperceived that she did not speak to him at once. \"There is my hand.\nIf it be possible give me yours.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Orme!\"\n\n\"I know that I have not said what I had to say very--very gracefully.\nBut you will not regard that I think. You are too good, and too\ntrue.\"\n\nShe had now seated herself, and he was standing before her. She had\nretreated to a sofa in order to avoid the hand which he had offered\nher; but he followed her, and even yet did not know that he had no\nchance of success. \"Mr. Orme,\" she said at last, speaking hardly\nabove her breath, \"what has made you do this?\"\n\n\"What has made me do it? What has made me tell you that I love you?\"\n\n\"You cannot be in earnest!\"\n\n\"Not in earnest! By heavens, Miss Staveley, no man who has said the\nsame words was ever more in earnest. Do you doubt me when I tell you\nthat I love you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so sorry!\" And then she hid her face upon the arm of the\nsofa and burst into tears.\n\nPeregrine stood there, like a prisoner on his trial, waiting for a\nverdict. He did not know how to plead his cause with any further\nlanguage; and indeed no further language could have been of any\navail. The judge and jury were clear against him, and he should have\nknown the sentence without waiting to have it pronounced in set\nterms. But in plain words he had made his offer, and in plain words\nhe required that an answer should be given to him. \"Well,\" he said,\n\"will you not speak to me? Will you not tell me whether it shall be\nso?\"\n\n\"No,--no,--no,\" she said.\n\n\"You mean that you cannot love me.\" And as he said this the agony\nof his tone struck her ear and made her feel that he was suffering.\nHitherto she had thought only of herself, and had hardly recognised\nit as a fact that he could be thoroughly in earnest.\n\n\"Mr. Orme, I am very sorry. Do not speak as though you were angry\nwith me. But--\"\n\n\"But you cannot love me?\" And then he stood again silent, for there\nwas no reply. \"Is it that, Miss Staveley, that you mean to answer? If\nyou say that with positive assurance, I will trouble you no longer.\"\nPoor Peregrine! He was but an unskilled lover!\n\n\"No!\" she sobbed forth through her tears; but he had so framed his\nquestion that he hardly knew what No meant.\n\n\"Do you mean that you cannot love me, or may I hope that a day will\ncome--? May I speak to you again--?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no! I can answer you now. It grieves me to the heart. I know\nyou are so good. But, Mr. Orme--\"\n\n\"Well--\"\n\n\"It can never, never be.\"\n\n\"And I must take that as answer?\"\n\n\"I can make no other.\" He still stood before her,--with gloomy and\nalmost angry brow, could she have seen him; and then he thought he\nwould ask her whether there was any other love which had brought\nabout her scorn for him. It did not occur to him, at the first\nmoment, that in doing so he would insult and injure her.\n\n\"At any rate I am not flattered by a reply which is at once so\ndecided,\" he began by saying.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Orme, do not make me more unhappy--\"\n\n\"But perhaps I am too late. Perhaps--\" Then he remembered himself and\npaused. \"Never mind,\" he said, speaking to himself rather than to\nher. \"Good-bye, Miss Staveley. You will at any rate say good-bye to\nme. I shall go at once now.\"\n\n\"Go at once! Go away, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"Yes; why should I stay here? Do you think that I could sit down to\ntable with you all after that? I will ask your brother to explain my\ngoing; I shall find him in his room. Good-bye.\"\n\nShe took his hand mechanically, and then he left her. When she came\ndown to dinner she looked furtively round to his place and saw that\nit was vacant.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nFOOTSTEPS IN THE CORRIDOR.\n\n\n\"Upon my word I am very sorry,\" said the judge. \"But what made him go\noff so suddenly? I hope there's nobody ill at The Cleeve!\" And then\nthe judge took his first spoonful of soup.\n\n\"No, no; there is nothing of that sort,\" said Augustus. \"His\ngrandfather wants him, and Orme thought he might as well start at\nonce. He was always a sudden harum-scarum fellow like that.\"\n\n\"He's a very pleasant, nice young man,\" said Lady Staveley; \"and\nnever gives himself any airs. I like him exceedingly.\"\n\nPoor Madeline did not dare to look either at her mother or her\nbrother, but she would have given much to know whether either of them\nwere aware of the cause which had sent Peregrine Orme so suddenly\naway from the house. At first she thought that Augustus surely did\nknow, and she was wretched as she thought that he might probably\nspeak to her on the subject. But he went on talking about Orme and\nhis abrupt departure till she became convinced that he knew nothing\nand suspected nothing of what had occurred.\n\nBut her mother said never a word after that eulogium which she had\nuttered, and Madeline read that eulogium altogether aright. It said\nto her ears that if ever young Orme should again come forward with\nhis suit, her mother would be prepared to receive him as a suitor;\nand it said, moreover, that if that suitor had been already sent away\nby any harsh answer, she would not sympathise with that harshness.\n\nThe dinner went on much as usual, but Madeline could not bring\nherself to say a word. She sat between her brother-in-law, Mr.\nArbuthnot, on one side, and an old friend of her father's, of thirty\nyears' standing, on the other. The old friend talked exclusively to\nLady Staveley, and Mr. Arbuthnot, though he now and then uttered a\nword or two, was chiefly occupied with his dinner. During the last\nthree or four days she had sat at dinner next to Peregrine Orme, and\nit seemed to her now that she always had been able to talk to him.\nShe had liked him so much too! Was it not a pity that he should have\nbeen so mistaken! And then as she sat after dinner, eating five or\nsix grapes, she felt that she was unable to recall her spirits and\nlook and speak as she was wont to do: a thing had happened which had\nknocked the ground from under her--had thrown her from her equipoise,\nand now she lacked the strength to recover herself and hide her\ndismay.\n\nAfter dinner, while the gentlemen were still in the dining-room, she\ngot a book, and nobody disturbed her as she sat alone pretending to\nread it. There never had been any intimate friendship between her and\nMiss Furnival, and that young lady was now employed in taking the\nchief part in a general conversation about wools. Lady Staveley got\nthrough a good deal of wool in the course of the year, as also did\nthe wife of the old thirty-years' friend; but Miss Furnival, short as\nher experience had been, was able to give a few hints to them both,\nand did not throw away the occasion. There was another lady there,\nrather deaf, to whom Mrs. Arbuthnot devoted herself, and therefore\nMadeline was allowed to be alone.\n\nThen the men came in, and she was obliged to come forward and\nofficiate at the tea-table. The judge insisted on having the teapot\nand urn brought into the drawing-room, and liked to have his cup\nbrought to him by one of his own daughters. So she went to work and\nmade the tea; but still she felt that she scarcely knew how to go\nthrough her task. What had happened to her that she should be thus\nbeside herself, and hardly capable of refraining from open tears?\nShe knew that her mother was looking at her, and that now and again\nlittle things were done to give her ease if any ease were possible.\n\n\"Is anything the matter with my Madeline?\" said her father, looking\nup into her face, and holding the hand from which he had taken his\ncup.\n\n\"No, papa; only I have got a headache.\"\n\n\"A headache, dear; that's not usual with you.\"\n\n\"I have seen that she has not been well all the evening,\" said Lady\nStaveley; \"but I thought that perhaps she might shake it off. You had\nbetter go, my dear, if you are suffering. Isabella, I'm sure, will\npour out the tea for us.\"\n\nAnd so she got away, and skulked slowly up stairs to her own room.\nShe felt that it was skulking. Why should she have been so weak as to\nhave fled in that way? She had no headache--nor was it heartache that\nhad now upset her. But a man had spoken to her openly of love, and no\nman had ever so spoken to her before.\n\nShe did not go direct to her own chamber, but passed along the\ncorridor towards her mother's dressing-room. It was always her custom\nto remain there some half-hour before she went to bed, doing little\nthings for her mother, and chatting with any other girl who might be\nintimate enough to be admitted there. Now she might remain there for\nan hour alone without danger of being disturbed; and she thought to\nherself that she would remain there till her mother came, and then\nunburthen herself of the whole story.\n\nAs she went along the corridor she would have to pass the room which\nhad been given up to Felix Graham. She saw that the door was ajar,\nand as she came close up to it, she found the nurse in the act of\ncoming out from the room. Mrs. Baker had been a very old servant in\nthe judge's family, and had known Madeline from the day of her birth.\nHer chief occupation for some years had been nursing when there was\nanybody to nurse, and taking a general care and surveillance of the\nfamily's health when there was no special invalid to whom she could\ndevote herself. Since Graham's accident she had been fully employed,\nand had greatly enjoyed the opportunities it had given her.\n\nMrs. Baker was in the doorway as Madeline attempted to pass by on\ntiptoe. \"Oh, he's a deal better now, Miss Madeline, so that you\nneedn't be afeard of disturbing;--ain't you, Mr. Graham?\" So she was\nthus brought into absolute contact with her friend, for the first\ntime since he had hurt himself.\n\n[Illustration: Footsteps in the corridor.]\n\n\"Indeed I am,\" said Felix; \"I only wish they'd let me get up and go\ndown stairs. Is that Miss Staveley, Mrs. Baker?\"\n\n\"Yes, sure. Come, my dear, he's got his dressing-gown on, and you may\njust come to the door and ask him how he does.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to hear that you are so much better, Mr. Graham,\"\nsaid Madeline, standing in the doorway with averted eyes, and\nspeaking with a voice so low that it only just reached his ears.\n\n\"Thank you, Miss Staveley; I shall never know how to express what I\nfeel for you all.\"\n\n\"And there's none of 'em have been more anxious about you than she,\nI can tell you; and none of 'em ain't kinder-hearteder,\" said Mrs.\nBaker.\n\n\"I hope you will be up soon and be able to come down to the\ndrawing-room,\" said Madeline. And then she did glance round, and for\na moment saw the light of his eye as he sat upright in the bed. He\nwas still pale and thin, or at least she fancied so, and her heart\ntrembled within her as she thought of the danger he had passed.\n\n\"I do so long to be able to talk to you again; all the others come\nand visit me, but I have only heard the sounds of your footsteps as\nyou pass by.\"\n\n\"And yet she always walks like a mouse,\" said Mrs. Baker.\n\n\"But I have always heard them,\" he said. \"I hope Marian thanked you\nfor the books. She told me how you had gotten them for me.\"\n\n\"She should not have said anything about them; it was Augustus who\nthought of them,\" said Madeline.\n\n\"Marian comes to me four or five times a day,\" he continued; \"I do\nnot know what I should do without her.\"\n\n\"I hope she is not noisy,\" said Madeline.\n\n\"Laws, miss, he don't care for noise now, only he ain't good at\nmoving yet, and won't be for some while.\"\n\n\"Pray take care of yourself, Mr. Graham,\" she said; \"I need not\ntell you how anxious we all are for your recovery. Good night, Mr.\nGraham.\" And then she passed on to her mother's dressing-room, and\nsitting herself down in an arm-chair opposite to the fire began to\nthink--to think, or else to try to think.\n\nAnd what was to be the subject of her thoughts? Regarding Peregrine\nOrme there was very little room for thinking. He had made her an\noffer, and she had rejected it as a matter of course, seeing that she\ndid not love him. She had no doubt on that head, and was well aware\nthat she could never accept such an offer. On what subject then was\nit necessary that she should think?\n\nHow odd it was that Mr. Graham's room door should have been open\non this especial evening, and that nurse should have been standing\nthere, ready to give occasion for that conversation! That was the\nidea that first took possession of her brain. And then she recounted\nall those few words which had been spoken as though they had had some\nspecial value--as though each word had been laden with interest. She\nfelt half ashamed of what she had done in standing there and speaking\nat his bedroom door, and yet she would not have lost the chance for\nworlds. There had been nothing in what had passed between her and the\ninvalid. The very words, spoken elsewhere, or in the presence of her\nmother and sister, would have been insipid and valueless; and yet she\nsat there feeding on them as though they were of flavour so rich that\nshe could not let the sweetness of them pass from her. She had been\nstunned at the idea of poor Peregrine's love, and yet she never asked\nherself what was this new feeling. She did not inquire--not yet at\nleast--whether there might be danger in such feelings.\n\nShe remained there, with eyes fixed on the burning coals, till her\nmother came up. \"What, Madeline,\" said Lady Staveley, \"are you here\nstill? I was in hopes you would have been in bed before this.\"\n\n\"My headache is gone now, mamma; and I waited because--\"\n\n\"Well, dear; because what?\" and her mother came and stood over her\nand smoothed her hair. \"I know very well that something has been the\nmatter. There has been something; eh, Madeline?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"And you have remained up that we may talk about it. Is that it,\ndearest?\"\n\n\"I did not quite mean that, but perhaps it will be best. I can't be\ndoing wrong, mamma, in telling you.\"\n\n\"Well; you shall judge of that yourself;\" and Lady Staveley sat down\non the sofa so that she was close to the chair which Madeline still\noccupied. \"As a general rule I suppose you could not be doing wrong;\nbut you must decide. If you have any doubt, wait till to-morrow.\"\n\n\"No, mamma; I will tell you now. Mr. Orme--\"\n\n\"Well, dearest. Did Mr. Orme say anything specially to you before he\nwent away?\"\n\n\"He--he--\"\n\n\"Come to me, Madeline, and sit here. We shall talk better then.\"\nAnd the mother made room beside her on the sofa for her daughter,\nand Madeline, running over, leaned with her head upon her mother's\nshoulder. \"Well, darling; what did he say? Did he tell you that he\nloved you?\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma.\"\n\n\"And you answered him--\"\n\n\"I could only tell him--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know. Poor fellow! But, Madeline, is he not an excellent\nyoung man;--one, at any rate, that is lovable? Of course in such a\nmatter the heart must answer for itself. But I, looking at the offer\nas a mother--I could have been well pleased--\"\n\n\"But, mamma, I could not--\"\n\n\"Well, love, there shall be an end of it; at least for the present.\nWhen I heard that he had gone suddenly away I thought that something\nhad happened.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry that he should be unhappy, for I know that he is\ngood.\"\n\n\"Yes, he is good; and your father likes him, and Augustus. In such a\nmatter as this, Madeline, I would never say a word to persuade you. I\nshould think it wrong to do so. But it may be, dearest, that he has\nflurried you by the suddenness of his offer; and that you have not\nyet thought much about it.\"\n\n\"But, mamma, I know that I do not love him.\"\n\n\"Of course. That is natural. It would have been a great misfortune if\nyou had loved him before you had reason to know that he loved you;--a\ngreat misfortune. But now,--now that you cannot but think of him, now\nthat you know what his wishes are, perhaps you may learn--\"\n\n\"But I have refused him, and he has gone away.\"\n\n\"Young gentlemen under such circumstances sometimes come back again.\"\n\n\"He won't come back, mamma, because--because I told him so plainly--I\nam sure he understands that it is all to be at an end.\"\n\n\"But if he should, and if you should then think differently towards\nhim--\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"But if you should, it may be well that you should know how all your\nfriends esteem him. In a worldly view the marriage would be in all\nrespects prudent; and as to disposition and temper, which I admit are\nmuch more important, I confess I think that he has all the qualities\nbest adapted to make a wife happy. But, as I said before, the heart\nmust speak for itself.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course. And I know that I shall never love him;--not in that\nway.\"\n\n\"You may be sure, dearest, that there will be no constraint put\nupon you. It might be possible that I or your papa should forbid a\ndaughter's marriage, if she had proposed to herself an imprudent\nmatch; but neither he nor I would ever use our influence with a child\nto bring about a marriage because we think it prudent in a worldly\npoint of view.\" And then Lady Staveley kissed her daughter.\n\n\"Dear mamma, I know how good you are to me.\" And she answered her\nmother's embrace by the pressure of her arm. But nevertheless she did\nnot feel herself to be quite comfortable. There was something in\nthe words which her mother had spoken which grated against her most\ncherished feelings;--something, though she by no means knew what.\nWhy had her mother cautioned her in that way, that there might be a\ncase in which she would refuse her sanction to a proposed marriage?\nIsabella's marriage had been concluded with the full agreement of\nthe whole family; and she, Madeline, had certainly never as yet\ngiven cause either to father or mother to suppose that she would\nbe headstrong and imprudent. Might not the caution have been\nomitted?--or was it intended to apply in any way to circumstances as\nthey now existed?\n\n\"You had better go now, dearest,\" said Lady Staveley, \"and for\nthe present we will not think any more about this gallant young\nknight.\" And then Madeline, having said good night, went off rather\ncrestfallen to her own room. In doing so she again had to pass\nGraham's door, and as she went by it, walking not quite on tiptoe,\nshe could not help asking herself whether or no he would really\nrecognise the sound of her footsteps.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to say that Lady Staveley had conceived\nto herself a recognised purpose in uttering that little caution\nto her daughter; and she would have been quite as well pleased\nhad circumstances taken Felix Graham out of her house instead of\nPeregrine Orme. But Felix Graham must necessarily remain for the next\nfortnight, and there could be no possible benefit in Orme's return,\nat any rate till Graham should have gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nWHAT BRIDGET BOLSTER HAD TO SAY.\n\n\nIt has been said in the earlier pages of this story that there was\nno prettier scenery to be found within thirty miles of London than\nthat by which the little town of Hamworth was surrounded. This was\nso truly the case that Hamworth was full of lodgings which in the\nautumn season were always full of lodgers. The middle of winter was\ncertainly not the time for seeing the Hamworth hills to advantage;\nnevertheless it was soon after Christmas that two rooms were taken\nthere by a single gentleman who had come down for a week, apparently\nwith no other view than that of enjoying himself. He did say\nsomething about London confinement and change of air; but he was\nmanifestly in good health, had an excellent appetite, said a great\ndeal about fresh eggs,--which at that time of the year was hardly\nreasonable, and brought with him his own pale brandy. This gentleman\nwas Mr. Crabwitz.\n\nThe house at which he was to lodge had been selected with\nconsiderable judgment. It was kept by a tidy old widow known as Mrs.\nTrump; but those who knew anything of Hamworth affairs were well\naware that Mrs. Trump had been left without a shilling, and could not\nhave taken that snug little house in Paradise Row and furnished it\ncompletely, out of her own means. No. Mrs. Trump's lodging-house was\none of the irons which Samuel Dockwrath ever kept heating in the\nfire, for the behoof of those fourteen children. He had taken a lease\nof the house in Paradise Row, having made a bargain and advanced a\nfew pounds while it was yet being built; and he then had furnished\nit and put in Mrs. Trump. Mrs. Trump received from him wages and a\npercentage; but to him were paid over the quota of shillings per\nweek in consideration for which the lodgers were accommodated. All\nof which Mr. Crabwitz had ascertained before he located himself in\nParadise Row.\n\nAnd when he had so located himself he soon began to talk to Mrs.\nTrump about Mr. Dockwrath. He himself, as he told her in confidence,\nwas in the profession of the law; he had heard of Mr. Dockwrath, and\nshould be very glad if that gentleman would come over and take a\nglass of brandy and water with him some evening.\n\n\"And a very clever sharp gentleman he is,\" said Mrs. Trump.\n\n\"With a tolerably good business, I suppose?\" asked Crabwitz.\n\n\"Pretty fair for that, sir. But he do be turning his hand to\neverything. He's a mortal long family of his own, and he has need of\nit all, if it's ever so much. But he'll never be poor for the want of\nlooking after it.\"\n\nBut Mr. Dockwrath did not come near his lodger on the first evening,\nand Mr. Crabwitz made acquaintance with Mrs. Dockwrath before he saw\nher husband. The care of the fourteen children was not supposed to\nbe so onerous but that she could find a moment now and then to see\nwhether Mrs. Trump kept the furniture properly dusted, and did not\ninfringe any of the Dockwrathian rules. These were very strict; and\nwhenever they were broken it was on the head of Mrs. Dockwrath that\nthe anger of the ruler mainly fell.\n\n\"I hope you find everything comfortable, sir,\" said poor Miriam,\nhaving knocked at the sitting-room door when Crabwitz had just\nfinished his dinner.\n\n\"Yes, thank you; very nice. Is that Mrs. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir. I'm Mrs. Dockwrath. As it's we who own the room I looked\nin to see if anything's wanting.\"\n\n\"You are very kind. No; nothing is wanting. But I should be delighted\nto make your acquaintance if you would stay for a moment. Might I ask\nyou to take a chair?\" and Mr. Crabwitz handed her one.\n\n\"Thank you; no, sir I won't intrude.\"\n\n\"Not at all, Mrs. Dockwrath. But the fact is, I'm a lawyer myself,\nand I should be so glad to become known to your husband. I have heard\na great deal of his name lately as to a rather famous case in which\nhe is employed.\"\n\n\"Not the Orley Farm case?\" said Mrs. Dockwrath immediately.\n\n\"Yes, yes; exactly.\"\n\n\"And is he going on with that, sir?\" asked Mrs. Dockwrath with great\ninterest.\n\n\"Is he not? I know nothing about it myself, but I always supposed\nthat such was the case. If I had such a wife as you, Mrs. Dockwrath,\nI should not leave her in doubt as to what I was doing in my own\nprofession.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about it, Mr. Cooke;\"--for it was as Mr. Cooke that\nhe now sojourned at Hamworth. Not that it should be supposed he had\nreceived instructions from Mr. Furnival to come down to that place\nunder a false name. From Mr. Furnival he had received no further\ninstructions on that matter than those conveyed at the end of a\nprevious chapter. \"I know nothing about it, Mr. Cooke; and don't want\nto know generally. But I am anxious about this Orley Farm case. I do\nhope that he's going to drop it.\" And then Mr. Crabwitz elicited her\nview of the case with great ease.\n\nOn that evening, about nine, Mr. Dockwrath did go over to Paradise\nRow, and did allow himself to be persuaded to mix a glass of brandy\nand water and light a cigar. \"My missus tells me, sir, that you\nbelong to the profession as well as myself.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; I'm a lawyer, Mr. Dockwrath.\"\n\n\"Practising in town as an attorney, sir?\"\n\n\"Not as an attorney on my own hook exactly. I chiefly employ my time\nin getting up cases for barristers. There's a good deal done in that\nway.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, beginning to feel himself the\nbigger man of the two; and from that moment he patronised his\ncompanion instead of allowing himself to be patronised.\n\nThis went against the grain with Mr. Crabwitz, but, having an object\nto gain, he bore it. \"We hear a great deal up in London just at\npresent about this Orley Farm case, and I always hear your name as\nconnected with it. I had no idea when I was taking these lodgings\nthat I was coming into a house belonging to that Mr. Dockwrath.\"\n\n\"The same party, sir,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, blowing the smoke out of\nhis mouth as he looked up to the ceiling.\n\nAnd then by degrees Mr. Crabwitz drew him into conversation.\nDockwrath was by nature quite as clever a man as Crabwitz, and in\nsuch a matter as this was not one to be outwitted easily; but in\ntruth he had no objection to talk about the Orley Farm case. \"I have\ntaken it up on public motives, Mr. Cooke,\" he said, \"and I mean to go\nthrough with it.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course; in such a case as that you will no doubt go through\nwith it?\"\n\n\"That's my intention, I assure you. And I tell you what; young\nMason,--that's the son of the widow of the old man who made the\nwill--\"\n\n\"Or rather who did not make it, as you say.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; he made the will; but he did not make the codicil--and\nthat young Mason has no more right to the property than you have.\"\n\n\"Hasn't he now?\"\n\n\"No; and I can prove it too.\"\n\n\"Well; the general opinion in the profession is that Lady Mason will\nstand her ground and hold her own. I don't know what the points are\nmyself, but I have heard it discussed, and that is certainly what\npeople think.\"\n\n\"Then people will find that they are very much mistaken.\"\n\n\"I was talking to one of Round's young men about it, and I fancy they\nare not very sanguine.\"\n\n\"I do not care a fig for Round or his young men. It would be quite\nas well for Joseph Mason if Round and Crook gave up the matter\naltogether. It lies in a nutshell, and the truth must come out\nwhatever Round and Crook may choose to say. And I'll tell you\nmore--old Furnival, big a man as he thinks himself, cannot save her.\"\n\n\"Has he anything to do with it?\" asked Mr. Cooke.\n\n\"Yes; the sly old fox. My belief is that only for him she'd give up\nthe battle, and be down on her marrow-bones asking for mercy.\"\n\n\"She'd have little chance of mercy, from what I hear of Joseph\nMason.\"\n\n\"She'd have to give up the property of course. And even then I don't\nknow whether he'd let her off. By heavens! he couldn't let her off\nunless I chose.\" And then by degrees he told Mr. Cooke some of the\ncircumstances of the case.\n\nBut it was not till the fourth evening that Mr. Dockwrath spent with\nhis lodger that the intimacy had so far progressed as to enable Mr.\nCrabwitz to proceed with his little scheme. On that day Mr. Dockwrath\nhad received a notice that at noon on the following morning Mr.\nJoseph Mason and Bridget Bolster would both be at the house of\nMessrs. Round and Crook in Bedford Row, and that he could attend at\nthat hour if it so pleased him. It certainly would so please him,\nhe said to himself when he got that letter; and in the evening he\nmentioned to his new friend the business which was taking him to\nLondon.\n\n\"If I might advise you in the matter, Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Crabwitz,\n\"I should stay away altogether.\"\n\n\"And why so?\"\n\n\"Because that's not your market. This poor devil of a woman--for she\nis a poor devil of a woman--\"\n\n\"She'll be poor enough before long.\"\n\n\"It can't be any gratification to you running her down.\"\n\n\"Ah, but the justice of the thing.\"\n\n\"Bother. You're talking now to a man of the world. Who can say what\nis the justice or the injustice of anything after twenty years of\npossession? I have no doubt the codicil did express the old man's\nwish,--even from your own story. But of course you are looking for\nyour market. Now it seems to me that there's a thousand pounds in\nyour way as clear as daylight.\"\n\n\"I don't see it myself, Mr. Cooke.\"\n\n\"No; but I do. The sort of thing is done every day. You have your\nfather-in-law's office journal?\"\n\n\"Safe enough.\"\n\n\"Burn it;--or leave it about in these rooms like;--so that somebody\nelse may burn it.\"\n\n\"I'd like to see the thousand pounds first.\"\n\n\"Of course you'd do nothing till you knew about that;--nothing except\nkeeping away from Round and Crook to-morrow. The money would be\nforthcoming if the trial were notoriously dropped by next assizes.\"\n\nDockwrath sat thinking for a minute or two, and every moment of\nthought made him feel more strongly that he could not now succeed in\nthe manner pointed out by Mr. Cooke. \"But where would be the market\nyou are talking of?\" said he.\n\n\"I could manage that,\" said Crabwitz.\n\n\"And go shares in the business?\"\n\n\"No, no; nothing of the sort.\" And then he added, remembering that he\nmust show that he had some personal object, \"If I got a trifle in the\nmatter it would not come out of your allowance.\"\n\nThe attorney again sat silent for a while, and now he remained so for\nfull five minutes, during which Mr. Crabwitz puffed the smoke from\nbetween his lips with a look of supreme satisfaction. \"May I ask,\" at\nlast Mr. Dockwrath said, \"whether you have any personal interest in\nthis matter?\"\n\n\"None in the least;--that is to say, none as yet.\"\n\n\"You did not come down here with any view--\"\n\n\"Oh dear no; nothing of the sort. But I see at a glance that it is\none of those cases in which a compromise would be the most judicious\nsolution of difficulties. I am well used to this kind of thing, Mr.\nDockwrath.\"\n\n\"It would not do, sir,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, after some further slight\nperiod of consideration. \"It wouldn't do. Round and Crook have all\nthe dates, and so has Mason too. And the original of that partnership\ndeed is forthcoming; and they know what witnesses to depend on. No,\nsir; I've begun this on public grounds, and I mean to carry it on. I\nam in a manner bound to do so as the representative of the attorney\nof the late Sir Joseph Mason;--and by heavens, Mr. Cooke, I'll do my\nduty.\"\n\n\"I dare say you're right,\" said Mr. Crabwitz, mixing a quarter of a\nglass more brandy and water.\n\n\"I know I'm right, sir,\" said Dockwrath. \"And when a man knows he's\nright, he has a deal of inward satisfaction in the feeling.\" After\nthat Mr. Crabwitz was aware that he could be of no use at Hamworth,\nbut he stayed out his week in order to avoid suspicion.\n\nOn the following day Mr. Dockwrath did proceed to Bedford Row,\ndetermined to carry out his original plan, and armed with that inward\nsatisfaction to which he had alluded. He dressed himself in his best,\nand endeavoured as far as was in his power to look as though he were\nequal to the Messrs. Round. Old Crook he had seen once, and him he\nalready despised. He had endeavoured to obtain a private interview\nwith Mrs. Bolster before she could be seen by Matthew Round; but in\nthis he had not succeeded. Mrs. Bolster was a prudent woman, and,\nacting doubtless under advice, had written to him, saying that she\nhad been summoned to the office of Messrs. Round and Crook, and would\nthere declare all that she knew about the matter. At the same time\nshe returned to him a money order which he had sent to her.\n\nPunctually at twelve he was in Bedford Row, and there he saw a\nrespectable-looking female sitting at the fire in the inner part of\nthe outer office. This was Bridget Bolster, but he would by no means\nhave recognised her. Bridget had risen in the world and was now head\nchambermaid at a large hotel in the west of England. In that capacity\nshe had laid aside whatever diffidence may have afflicted her earlier\nyears, and was now able to speak out her mind before any judge or\njury in the land. Indeed she had never been much afflicted by such\ndiffidence, and had spoken out her evidence on that former occasion,\nnow twenty years since, very plainly. But as she now explained to the\nhead clerk, she had at that time been only a poor ignorant slip of a\ngirl, with no more than eight pounds a year wages.\n\nDockwrath bowed to the head clerk, and passed on to Mat Round's\nprivate room. \"Mr. Matthew is inside, I suppose,\" said he, and hardly\nwaiting for permission he knocked at the door, and then entered.\nThere he saw Mr. Matthew Round, sitting in his comfortable arm-chair,\nand opposite to him sat Mr. Mason of Groby Park.\n\nMr. Mason got up and shook hands with the Hamworth attorney, but\nRound junior made his greeting without rising, and merely motioned\nhis visitor to a chair.\n\n\"Mr. Mason and the young ladies are quite well, I hope?\" said Mr.\nDockwrath, with a smile.\n\n\"Quite well, I thank you,\" said the county magistrate.\n\n\"This matter has progressed since I last had the pleasure of seeing\nthem. You begin to think I was right; eh, Mr. Mason?\"\n\n\"Don't let us triumph till we are out of the wood,\" said Mr. Round.\n\"It is a deal easier to spend money in such an affair as this than it\nis to make money by it. However we shall hear to-day more about it.\"\n\n\"I do not know about making money,\" said Mr. Mason, very solemnly.\n\"But that I have been robbed by that woman out of my just rights in\nthat estate for the last twenty years,--that I may say I do know.\"\n\n\"Quite true, Mr. Mason; quite true,\" said Mr. Dockwrath with\nconsiderable energy.\n\n\"And whether I make money or whether I lose money I intend to proceed\nin this matter. It is dreadful to think that in this free and\nenlightened country so abject an offender should have been able to\nhold her head up so long without punishment and without disgrace.\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I feel,\" said Dockwrath. \"The very stones and\ntrees of Hamworth cry out against her.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Mr. Round, \"we have first to see whether there has\nbeen any injustice or not. If you will allow me I will explain to you\nwhat I now propose to do.\"\n\n\"Proceed, sir,\" said Mr. Mason, who was by no means satisfied with\nhis young attorney.\n\n\"Bridget Bolster is now in the next room, and as far as I can\nunderstand the case at present, she would be the witness on whom your\ncase, Mr. Mason, would most depend. The man Kenneby I have not yet\nseen; but from what I understand he is less likely to prove a willing\nwitness than Mrs. Bolster.\"\n\n\"I cannot go along with you there, Mr. Round,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"Excuse me, sir, but I am only stating my opinion. If I should find\nthat this woman is unable to say that she did not sign two separate\ndocuments on that day--that is, to say so with a positive and point\nblank assurance, I shall recommend you, as my client, to drop the\nprosecution.\"\n\n\"I will never drop it,\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"You will do as you please,\" continued Round; \"I can only say what\nunder such circumstances will be the advice given to you by this\nfirm. I have talked the matter over very carefully with my father and\nwith our other partner, and we shall not think well of going on with\nit unless I shall now find that your view is strongly substantiated\nby this woman.\"\n\nThen outspoke Mr. Dockwrath, \"Under these circumstances, Mr. Mason,\nif I were you, I should withdraw from the house at once. I certainly\nwould not have my case blown upon.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason, sir, will do as he pleases about that. As long as the\nbusiness with which he honours us is straight-forward, we will do it\nfor him, as for an old client, although it is not exactly in our own\nline. But we can only do it in accordance with our own judgment. I\nwill proceed to explain what I now propose to do. The woman Bolster\nis in the next room, and I, with the assistance of my head clerk,\nwill take down the headings of what evidence she can give.\"\n\n\"In our presence, sir,\" said Mr. Dockwrath; \"or if Mr. Mason should\ndecline, at any rate in mine.\"\n\n\"By no means, Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Round.\n\n\"I think Mr. Dockwrath should hear her story,\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"He certainly will not do so in this house or in conjunction with me.\nIn what capacity should he be present, Mr. Mason?\"\n\n\"As one of Mr. Mason's legal advisers,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"If you are to be one of them, Messrs. Round and Crook cannot be the\nothers. I think I explained that to you before. It now remains for\nMr. Mason to say whether he wishes to employ our firm in this matter\nor not. And I can tell him fairly,\" Mr. Round added this after a\nslight pause, \"that we shall be rather pleased than otherwise if he\nwill put the case into other hands.\"\n\n\"Of course I wish you to conduct it,\" said Mr. Mason, who, with all\nhis bitterness against the present holders of Orley Farm, was afraid\nof throwing himself into the hands of Dockwrath. He was not an\nignorant man, and he knew that the firm of Round and Crook bore a\nhigh reputation before the world.\n\n\"Then,\" said Round, \"I must do my business in accordance with my own\nviews of what is right. I have reason to believe that no one has\nyet tampered with this woman,\" and as he spoke he looked hard at\nDockwrath, \"though probably attempts may have been made.\"\n\n\"I don't know who should tamper with her,\" said Dockwrath, \"unless it\nbe Lady Mason--whom I must say you seem very anxious to protect.\"\n\n\"Another word like that, sir, and I shall be compelled to ask you to\nleave the house. I believe that this woman has been tampered with by\nno one. I will now learn from her what is her remembrance of the\ncircumstances as they occurred twenty years since, and I will then\nread to you her deposition. I shall be sorry, gentlemen, to keep you\nhere, perhaps for an hour or so, but you will find the morning papers\non the table.\" And then Mr. Round, gathering up certain documents,\npassed into the outer office, and Mr. Mason and Mr. Dockwrath were\nleft alone.\n\n\"He is determined to get that woman off,\" said Mr. Dockwrath, in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"I believe him to be an honest man,\" said Mr. Mason, with some\nsternness.\n\n\"Honesty, sir! It is hard to say what is honesty and what is\ndishonesty. Would you believe it, Mr. Mason, only last night I had a\nthousand pounds offered me to hold my tongue about this affair?\"\n\nMr. Mason at the moment did not believe this, but he merely looked\nhard into his companion's face, and said nothing.\n\n\"By the heavens above us what I tell you is true! a thousand pounds,\nMr. Mason! Only think how they are going it to get this thing\nstifled. And where should the offer come from but from those who know\nI have the power?\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that the offer came from this firm?\"\n\n\"Hush-sh, Mr. Mason. The very walls hear and talk in such a place as\nthis. I'm not to know who made the offer, and I don't know. But a man\ncan give a very good guess sometimes. The party who was speaking to\nme is up to the whole transaction, and knows exactly what is going on\nhere--here, in this house. He let it all out, using pretty nigh the\nsame words as Round used just now. He was full about the doubt that\nRound and Crook felt--that they'd never pull it through. I'll tell\nyou what it is, Mr. Mason, they don't mean to pull it through.\"\n\n\"What answer did you make to the man?\"\n\n\"What answer! why I just put my thumb this way over my shoulder.\nNo, Mr. Mason, if I can't carry on without bribery and corruption,\nI won't carry on at all. He'd called at the wrong house with that\ndodge, and so he soon found.\"\n\n\"And you think he was an emissary from Messrs. Round and Crook?\"\n\n\"Hush-sh-sh. For heaven's sake, Mr. Mason, do be a little lower. You\ncan put two and two together as well as I can, Mr. Mason. I find they\nmake four. I don't know whether your calculation will be the same. My\nbelief is, that these people are determined to save that woman. Don't\nyou see it in that young fellow's eye--that his heart is all on the\nother side. Now he's got hold of that woman Bolster, and he'll teach\nher to give such evidence as will upset us. But I'll be even with him\nyet, Mr. Mason. If you'll only trust me, we'll both be even with him\nyet.\"\n\nMr. Mason at the present moment said nothing further, and when\nDockwrath pressed him to continue the conversation in whispers, he\ndistinctly said that he would rather say no more upon the subject\njust then. He would wait for Mr. Round's return. \"Am I at liberty,\"\nhe asked, \"to mention that offer of the thousand pounds?\"\n\n\"What--to Mat Round?\" said Dockwrath. \"Certainly not, Mr. Mason. It\nwouldn't be our game at all.\"\n\n\"Very well, sir.\" And then Mr. Mason took up a newspaper, and no\nfurther words were spoken till the door opened and Mr. Round\nre-entered the room.\n\nThis he did with slow, deliberate step, and stopping on the\nhearth-rug, he stood leaning with his back against the mantelpiece.\nIt was clear from his face to see that he had much to tell, and clear\nalso that he was not pleased at the turn which affairs were taking.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen, I have examined the woman,\" he said, \"and here is\nher deposition.\"\n\n\"And what does she say?\" asked Mr. Mason.\n\n\"Come, out with it, sir,\" said Dockwrath. \"Did she, or did she not\nsign two documents on that day?\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason,\" said Round, turning to that gentleman, and altogether\nignoring Dockwrath and his question; \"I have to tell you that her\nstatement, as far as it goes, fully corroborates your view of the\ncase. As far as it goes, mind you.\"\n\n\"Oh, it does; does it?\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"And she is the only important witness?\" said Mr. Mason with great\nexultation.\n\n\"I have never said that; what I did say was this--that your case\nmust break down unless her evidence supported it. It does support\nit--strongly; but you will want more than that.\"\n\n\"And now if you please, Mr. Round, what is it that she has deposed?\"\nasked Dockwrath.\n\n\"She remembers it all then?\" said Mason.\n\n\"She is a remarkably clear-headed woman, and apparently does remember\na great deal. But her remembrance chiefly and most strongly goes to\nthis--that she witnessed only one deed.\"\n\n\"She can prove that, can she?\" said Mason, and the tone of his voice\nwas loudly triumphant.\n\n\"She declares that she never signed but one deed in the whole of her\nlife--either on that day or on any other; and over and beyond this\nshe says now--now that I have explained to her what that other deed\nmight have been--that old Mr. Usbech told her that it was about a\npartnership.\"\n\n\"He did, did he?\" said Dockwrath, rising from his chair and clapping\nhis hands. \"Very well. I don't think we shall want more than that,\nMr. Mason.\"\n\nThere was a tone of triumph in the man's voice, and a look of\ngratified malice in his countenance which disgusted Mr. Round and\nirritated him almost beyond his power of endurance. It was quite true\nthat he would much have preferred to find that the woman's evidence\nwas in favour of Lady Mason. He would have been glad to learn that\nshe actually had witnessed the two deeds on the same day. His tone\nwould have been triumphant, and his face gratified, had he returned\nto the room with such tidings. His feelings were all on that side,\nthough his duty lay on the other. He had almost expected that it\nwould be so. As it was, he was prepared to go on with his duty, but\nhe was not prepared to endure the insolence of Mr. Dockwrath. There\nwas a look of joy also about Mr. Mason which added to his annoyance.\nIt might be just and necessary to prosecute that unfortunate woman at\nOrley Farm, but he could not gloat over such work.\n\n\"Mr. Dockwrath,\" he said, \"I will not put up with such conduct here.\nIf you wish to rejoice about this, you must go elsewhere.\"\n\n\"And what are we to do now?\" said Mr. Mason. \"I presume there need be\nno further delay.\"\n\n\"I must consult with my partner. If you can make it convenient to\ncall this day week--\"\n\n\"But she will escape.\"\n\n\"No, she will not escape. I shall not be ready to say anything before\nthat. If you are not in town, then I can write to you.\" And so the\nmeeting was broken up, and Mr. Mason and Mr. Dockwrath left the\nlawyer's office together.\n\nMr. Mason and Mr. Dockwrath left the office in Bedford Row together,\nand thus it was almost a necessity that they should walk together for\nsome distance through the streets. Mr. Mason was going to his hotel\nin Soho Square, and Mr. Dockwrath turned with him through the passage\nleading into Red Lion Square, linking his own arm in that of his\ncompanion. The Yorkshire county magistrate did not quite like this,\nbut what was he to do?\n\n\"Did you ever see anything like that, sir?\" said Mr. Dockwrath; \"for\nby heavens I never did.\"\n\n\"Like what?\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"Like that fellow there;--that Round. It is my opinion that he\ndeserves to have his name struck from the rolls. Is it not clear that\nhe is doing all in his power to bring that wretched woman off? And\nI'll tell you what, Mr. Mason, if you let him play his own game in\nthat way, he will bring her off.\"\n\n\"But he expressly admitted that this woman Bolster's evidence is\nconclusive.\"\n\n\"Yes; he was so driven into a corner that he could not help admitting\nthat. The woman had been too many for him, and he found that he\ncouldn't cushion her. But do you mind my words, Mr. Mason. He intends\nthat you shall be beaten. It's as plain as the nose on your face. You\ncan read it in the very look of him, and in every tone of his voice.\nAt any rate I can. I'll tell you what it is\"--and then he squeezed\nvery close to Mr. Mason--\"he and old Furnival understand each other\nin this matter like two brothers. Of course Round will have his bill\nagainst you. Win or lose, he'll get his costs out of your pocket. But\nhe can make a deuced pretty thing out of the other side as well. Let\nme tell you, Mr. Mason, that when notes for a thousand pounds are\nflying here and there, it isn't every lawyer that will see them pass\nby him without opening his hand.\"\n\n\"I do not think that Mr. Round would take a bribe,\" said Mr. Mason\nvery stiffly.\n\n\"Wouldn't he? Just as a hound would a pat of butter. It's your own\nlook-out, you know, Mr. Mason. I haven't got an estate of twelve\nhundred a year depending on it. But remember this;--if she escapes\nnow, Orley Farm is gone for ever.\"\n\nAll this was extremely disagreeable to Mr. Mason. In the first place\nhe did not at all like the tone of equality which the Hamworth\nattorney had adopted; he did not like to acknowledge that his affairs\nwere in any degree dependent on a man of whom he thought so badly as\nhe did of Mr. Dockwrath; he did not like to be told that Round and\nCrook were rogues,--Round and Crook whom he had known all his life;\nbut least of all did he like the feeling of suspicion with which,\nin spite of himself, this man had imbued him, or the fear that his\nvictim might at last escape him. Excellent, therefore, as had been\nthe evidence with which Bridget Bolster had declared herself ready\nto give in his favour, Mr. Mason was not a contented man when he sat\ndown to his solitary beefsteak in Soho Square.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\nTHE ANGEL OF LIGHT.\n\n\nIn speaking of the character and antecedents of Felix Graham I have\nsaid that he was moulding a wife for himself. The idea of a wife thus\nmoulded to fit a man's own grooves, and educated to suit matrimonial\npurposes according to the exact views of the future husband was by no\nmeans original with him. Other men have moulded their wives, but I do\nnot know that as a rule the practice has been found to answer. It is\nopen, in the first place, to this objection,--that the moulder does\nnot generally conceive such idea very early in life, and the idea\nwhen conceived must necessarily be carried out on a young subject.\nSuch a plan is the result of much deliberate thought, and has\ngenerally arisen from long observation, on the part of the thinker,\nof the unhappiness arising from marriages in which there has been no\nmoulding. Such a frame of mind comes upon a bachelor, perhaps about\nhis thirty-fifth year, and then he goes to work with a girl of\nfourteen. The operation takes some ten years, at the end of which the\nmoulded bride regards her lord as an old man. On the whole I think\nthat the ordinary plan is the better, and even the safer. Dance\nwith a girl three times, and if you like the light of her eye and\nthe tone of voice with which she, breathless, answers your little\nquestions about horseflesh and music--about affairs masculine and\nfeminine,--then take the leap in the dark. There is danger, no doubt;\nbut the moulded wife is, I think, more dangerous.\n\nWith Felix Graham the matter was somewhat different, seeing that he\nwas not yet thirty, and that the lady destined to be the mistress\nof his family had already passed through three or four years of her\nnoviciate. He had begun to be prudent early in life; or had become\nprudent rather by force of sentiment than by force of thought. Mary\nSnow was the name of his bride-elect; and it is probable that, had\nnot circumstances thrown Mary Snow in his way, he would not have gone\nout of his way to seek a subject for his experiment. Mary Snow was\nthe daughter of an engraver,--not of an artist who receives four or\nfive thousand pounds for engraving the chef-d'oeuvre of a modern\npainter,--but of a man who executed flourishes on ornamental cards\nfor tradespeople, and assisted in the illustration of circus\nplaybills. With this man Graham had become acquainted through certain\ntransactions of his with the press, and had found him to be a\nwidower, drunken, dissolute, and generally drowned in poverty. One\nchild the man had, and that child was Mary Snow.\n\nHow it came to pass that the young barrister first took upon himself\nthe charge of maintaining and educating this poor child need not now\nbe told. His motives had been thoroughly good, and in the matter he\nhad endeavoured to act the part of a kind Samaritan. He had found her\npretty, half starved, dirty, ignorant, and modest; and so finding\nher had made himself responsible for feeding, cleaning, and teaching\nher,--and ultimately for marrying her. One would have said that in\nundertaking a task of such undoubted charity as that comprised in the\nthree first charges, he would have encountered no difficulty from\nthe drunken, dissolute, impoverished engraver. But the man from the\nbeginning was cunning; and before Graham had succeeded in obtaining\nthe custody of the child, the father had obtained a written\nundertaking from him that he would marry her at a certain age if\nher conduct up to that age had been becoming. As to this latter\nstipulation no doubt had arisen; and indeed Graham had so acted by\nher that had she fallen away the fault would have been all her own.\nThere wanted now but one year to the coming of that day on which he\nwas bound to make himself a happy man, and hitherto he himself had\nnever doubted as to the accomplishment of his undertaking.\n\nHe had told his friends,--those with whom he was really intimate,\nAugustus Staveley and one or two others,--what was to be his\nmatrimonial lot in life; and they had ridiculed him for his quixotic\nchivalry. Staveley especially had been strong in his conviction that\nno such marriage would ever take place, and had already gone so far\nas to plan another match for his friend.\n\n\"You know you do not love her,\" he had said, since Felix had been\nstaying on this occasion at Noningsby.\n\n\"I know no such thing,\" Felix had answered, almost in anger. \"On the\ncontrary I know that I do love her.\"\n\n\"Yes, as I love my niece Marian, or old Aunt Bessy, who always\nsupplied me with sugar-candy when I was a boy.\"\n\n\"It is I that have supplied Mary with her sugar-candy, and the love\nthus engendered is the stronger.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless you are not in love with her, and never will be, and if\nyou marry her you will commit a great sin.\"\n\n\"How moral you have grown!\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. I'm not a bit moral. But I know very well when a man\nis in love with a girl, and I know very well that you're not in love\nwith Mary Snow. And I tell you what, my friend, if you do marry her\nyou are done for life. There will absolutely be an end of you.\"\n\n\"You mean to say that your royal highness will drop me.\"\n\n\"I mean to say nothing about myself. My dropping you or not dropping\nyou won't alter your lot in life. I know very well what a poor man\nwants to give him a start; and a fellow like you who has such quaint\nideas on so many things requires all the assistance he can get. You\nshould look out for money and connection.\"\n\n\"Sophia Furnival, for instance.\"\n\n\"No; she would not suit you. I perceive that now.\"\n\n\"So I supposed. Well, my dear fellow, we shall not come to\nloggerheads about that. She is a very fine girl, and you are welcome\nto the hatful of money--if you can get it.\"\n\n\"That's nonsense. I'm not thinking of Sophia Furnival any more than\nyou are. But if I did it would be a proper marriage. Now--\" And then\nhe went on with some further very sage remarks about Miss Snow.\n\nAll this was said as Felix Graham was lying with his broken bones in\nthe comfortable room at Noningsby; and to tell the truth, when it was\nso said his heart was not quite at ease about Mary Snow. Up to this\ntime, having long since made up his mind that Mary should be his\nwife, he had never allowed his thoughts to be diverted from that\npurpose. Nor did he so allow them now,--as long as he could prevent\nthem from wandering.\n\nBut, lying there at Noningsby, thinking of those sweet Christmas\nevenings, how was it possible that they should not wander? His friend\nhad told him that he did not love Mary Snow; and then, when alone,\nhe asked himself whether in truth he did love her. He had pledged\nhimself to marry her, and he must carry out that pledge. But\nnevertheless did he love her? And if not her, did he love any other?\n\nMary Snow knew very well what was to be her destiny, and indeed had\nknown it for the last two years. She was now nineteen years old,--and\nMadeline Staveley was also nineteen; she was nineteen, and at twenty\nshe was to become a wife, as by agreement between Felix Graham and\nMr. Snow, the drunken engraver. They knew their destiny,--the future\nhusband and the future wife,--and each relied with perfect faith on\nthe good faith and affection of the other.\n\nGraham, while he was thus being lectured by Staveley, had under\nhis pillow a letter from Mary. He wrote to her regularly--on every\nSunday, and on every Tuesday she answered him. Nothing could be more\nbecoming than the way she obeyed all his behests on such matters;\nand it really did seem that in his case the moulded wife would turn\nout to have been well moulded. When Staveley left him he again read\nMary's letter. Her letters were always of the same length, filling\ncompletely the four sides of a sheet of note paper. They were\nexcellently well written; and as no one word in them was ever\naltered or erased, it was manifest enough to Felix that the original\ncomposition was made on a rough draft. As he again read through the\nfour sides of the little sheet of paper, he could not refrain from\nconjecturing what sort of a letter Madeline Staveley might write.\nMary Snow's letter ran as follows:--\n\n\n   3 Bloomfield Terrace, Peckham,\n   Tuesday, 10 January, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAREST FELIX,\n\n--she had so called him for the last twelvemonth by common consent\nbetween Graham and the very discreet lady under whose charge she at\npresent lived. Previously to that she had written to him as, My dear\nMr. Graham.\n\n   MY DEAREST FELIX,\n\n   I am very glad to hear that your arm and your two ribs are\n   getting so much better. I received your letter yesterday,\n   and was glad to hear that you are so comfortable in\n   the house of the very kind people with whom you are\n   staying. If I knew them I would send them my respectful\n   remembrances, but as I do not know them I suppose it would\n   not be proper. But I remember them in my prayers.--\n\nThis last assurance was inserted under the express instruction\nof Mrs. Thomas, who however did not read Mary's letters, but\noccasionally, on some subjects, gave her hints as to what she ought\nto say. Nor was there hypocrisy in this, for under the instruction of\nher excellent mentor she had prayed for the kind people.--\n\n   I hope you will be well enough to come and pay me a visit\n   before long, but pray do not come before you are well\n   enough to do so without giving yourself any pain. I am\n   glad to hear that you do not mean to go hunting any more,\n   for it seems to me to be a dangerous amusement.\n\nAnd then the first paragraph came to an end.\n\n   My papa called here yesterday. He said he was very badly\n   off indeed, and so he looked. I did not know what to\n   say at first, but he asked me so much to give him some\n   money, that I did give him at last all that I had. It was\n   nineteen shillings and sixpence. Mrs. Thomas was angry,\n   and told me I had no right to give away your money, and\n   that I should not have given more than half a crown. I\n   hope you will not be angry with me. I do not want any more\n   at present. But indeed he was very bad, especially about\n   his shoes.\n\n   I do not know that I have any more to say except that\n   I put back thirty lines of T\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a9maque into French every\n   morning before breakfast. It never comes near right, but\n   nevertheless M. Grigaud says it is well done. He says that\n   if it came quite right I should compose French as well as\n   M. F\u00c3\u00a9nelon, which of course I cannot expect.\n\n   I will now say good-bye, and I am yours most\n   affectionately,\n\n   MARY SNOW.\n\n\nThere was nothing in this letter to give any offence to Felix Graham,\nand so he acknowledged to himself. He made himself so acknowledge,\nbecause on the first reading of it he had felt that he was half angry\nwith the writer. It was clear that there was nothing in the letter\nwhich would justify censure;--nothing which did not, almost, demand\npraise. He would have been angry with her had she limited her filial\ndonation to the half-crown which Mrs. Thomas had thought appropriate.\nHe was obliged to her for that attention to her French which he had\nspecially enjoined. Nothing could be more proper than her allusion to\nthe Staveleys;--and altogether the letter was just what it ought to\nbe. Nevertheless it made him unhappy and irritated him. Was it well\nthat he should marry a girl whose father was \"indeed very bad, but\nespecially about his shoes?\" Staveley had told him that connection\nwould be necessary for him, and what sort of a connection would this\nbe? And was there one word in the whole letter that showed a spark\nof true love? Did not the footfall of Madeline Staveley's step as\nshe passed along the passage go nearer to his heart than all the\noutspoken assurance of Mary Snow's letter?\n\nNevertheless he had undertaken to do this thing, and he would do\nit,--let the footfall of Madeline Staveley's step be ever so sweet in\nhis ear. And then, lying back in his bed, he began to think whether\nit would have been as well that he should have broken his neck\ninstead of his ribs in getting out of Monkton Grange covert.\n\nMrs. Thomas was a lady who kept a school consisting of three little\ngirls and Mary Snow. She had in fact not been altogether successful\nin the line of life she had chosen for herself, and had hardly been\nable to keep her modest door-plate on her door, till Graham, in\nsearch of some home for his bride, then in the first noviciate of her\nmoulding, had come across her. Her means were now far from plentiful;\nbut as an average number of three children still clung to her, and\nas Mary Snow's seventy pounds per annum--to include clothes--were\npunctually paid, the small house at Peckham was maintained. Under\nthese circumstances Mary Snow was somebody in the eyes of Mrs.\nThomas, and Felix Graham was a very great person indeed.\n\nGraham had received his letter on a Wednesday, and on the following\nMonday Mary, as usual, received one from him. These letters always\ncame to her in the evening, as she was sitting over her tea with Mrs.\nThomas, the three children having been duly put to bed. Graham's\nletters were very short, as a man with a broken right arm and two\nbroken ribs is not fluent with his pen. But still a word or two did\ncome to her. \"Dearest Mary, I am doing better and better, and I hope\nI shall see you in about a fortnight. Quite right in giving the\nmoney. Stick to the French. Your own F. G.\" But as he signed himself\nher own, his mind misgave him that he was lying.\n\n\"It is very good of him to write to you while he is in such a state,\"\nsaid Mrs. Thomas.\n\n\"Indeed it is,\" said Mary--\"very good indeed.\" And then she went\non with the history of \"Rasselas\" in his happy valley, by which\nstudy Mrs. Thomas intended to initiate her into that course of\nnovel-reading which has become necessary for a British lady. But Mrs.\nThomas had a mind to improve the present occasion. It was her duty to\ninculcate in her pupil love and gratitude towards the beneficent man\nwho was doing so much for her. Gratitude for favours past and love\nfor favours to come; and now, while that scrap of a letter was lying\non the table, the occasion for doing so was opportune.\n\n\"Mary, I do hope you love Mr. Graham with all your heart and all your\nstrength.\" She would have thought it wicked to say more; but so far\nshe thought she might go, considering the sacred tie which was to\nexist between her pupil and the gentleman in question.\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed I do;\" and then Mary's eyes fell wishfully on the\ncover of the book which lay in her lap while her finger kept the\nplace. Rasselas is not very exciting, but it was more so than Mrs.\nThomas.\n\n\"You would be very wicked if you did not. And I hope you think\nsometimes of the very responsible duties which a wife owes to her\nhusband. And this will be more especially so with you than with any\nother woman--almost that I ever heard of.\"\n\nThere was something in this that was almost depressing to poor Mary's\nspirit, but nevertheless she endeavoured to bear up against it and\ndo her duty. \"I shall do all I can to please him, Mrs. Thomas;--and\nindeed I do try about the French. And he says I was right to give\npapa that money.\"\n\n\"But there will be many more things than that when you've stood at\nthe altar with him and become his wife;--bone of his bone, Mary.\" And\nshe spoke these last words in a very solemn tone, shaking her head,\nand the solemn tone almost ossified poor Mary's heart as she heard\nit.\n\n\"Yes; I know there will. But I shall endeavour to find out what he\nlikes.\"\n\n\"I don't think he is so particular about his eating and drinking as\nsome other gentlemen; though no doubt he will like his things nice.\"\n\n\"I know he is fond of strong tea, and I sha'n't forget that.\"\n\n\"And about dress. He is not very rich you know, Mary; but it will\nmake him unhappy if you are not always tidy. And his own shirts--I\nfancy he has no one to look after them now, for I so often see the\nbuttons off. You should never let one of them go into his drawers\nwithout feeling them all to see that they're on tight.\"\n\n\"I'll remember that,\" said Mary, and then she made another little\nfurtive attempt to open the book.\n\n\"And about your own stockings, Mary. Nothing is so useful to a young\nwoman in your position as a habit of darning neat. I'm sometimes\nalmost afraid that you don't like darning.\"\n\n\"Oh yes I do.\" That was a fib; but what could she do, poor girl, when\nso pressed?\n\n\"Because I thought you would look at Jane Robinson's and Julia\nWright's which are lying there in the basket. I did Rebecca's myself\nbefore tea, till my old eyes were sore.\"\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know,\" said Mary, with some slight offence in her tone.\n\"Why didn't you ask me to do them downright if you wanted?\"\n\n\"It's only for the practice it will give you.\"\n\n\"Practice! I'm always practising something.\" But nevertheless she\nlaid down the book, and dragged the basket of work up on to the\ntable. \"Why, Mrs. Thomas, it's impossible to mend these; they're all\ndarn.\"\n\n\"Give them to me,\" said Mrs. Thomas. And then there was silence\nbetween them for a quarter of an hour during which Mary's thoughts\nwandered away to the events of her future life. Would his stockings\nbe so troublesome as these?\n\nBut Mrs. Thomas was at heart an honest woman, and as a rule was\nhonest also in practice. Her conscience told her that Mr. Graham\nmight probably not approve of this sort of practice for conjugal\nduties, and in spite of her failing eyes she resolved to do her duty.\n\"Never mind them, Mary,\" said she. \"I remember now that you were\ndoing your own before dinner.\"\n\n\"Of course I was,\" said Mary sulkily. \"And as for practice, I don't\nsuppose he'll want me to do more of that than anything else.\"\n\n\"Well, dear, put them by.\" And Miss Snow did put them by, resuming\nRasselas as she did so. Who darned the stockings of Rasselas and felt\nthat the buttons were tight on his shirts? What a happy valley must\nit have been if a bride expectant were free from all such cares as\nthese!\n\n\"I suppose, Mary, it will be some time in the spring of next year.\"\nMrs. Thomas was not reading, and therefore a little conversation from\ntime to time was to her a solace.\n\n\"What will be, Mrs. Thomas?\"\n\n\"Why, the marriage.\"\n\n\"I suppose it will. He told father it should be early in 18--, and I\nshall be past twenty then.\"\n\n\"I wonder where you'll go to live.\"\n\n\"I don't know. He has never said anything about that.\"\n\n\"I suppose not; but I'm sure it will be a long way away from\nPeckham.\" In answer to this Mary said nothing, but could not help\nwishing that it might be so. Peckham to her had not been a place\nbright with happiness, although she had become in so marked a way a\nchild of good fortune. And then, moreover, she had a deep care on her\nmind with which the streets and houses and pathways of Peckham were\nclosely connected. It would be very expedient that she should go far,\nfar away from Peckham when she had become, in actual fact, the very\nwife of Felix Graham.\n\n\"Miss Mary,\" whispered the red-armed maid of all work, creeping up\nto Mary's bedroom door, when they had all retired for the night, and\nwhispering through the chink. \"Miss Mary. I've somethink to say.\"\nAnd Mary opened the door. \"I've got a letter from him;\" and the maid\nof all work absolutely produced a little note enclosed in a green\nenvelope.\n\n\"Sarah, I told you not,\" said Mary, looking very stern and hesitating\nwith her finger whether or no she would take the letter.\n\n\"But he did so beg and pray. Besides, miss, as he says hisself he\nmust have his answer. Any gen'leman, he says, 'as a right to a\nanswer. And if you'd a seed him yourself I'm sure you'd have took it.\nHe did look so nice with a blue and gold hankercher round his neck.\nHe was a-going to the the-a-tre he said.\"\n\n\"And who was going with him, Sarah?\"\n\n\"Oh, no one. Only his mamma and sister, and them sort. He's all\nright--he is.\" And then Mary Snow did take the letter.\n\n\"And I'll come for the answer when you're settling the room after\nbreakfast to-morrow?\" said the girl.\n\n\"No; I don't know. I sha'n't send any answer at all. But, Sarah, for\nheaven's sake, do not say a word about it!\"\n\n\"Who, I? Laws love you, miss. I wouldn't;--not for worlds of gold.\"\nAnd then Mary was left alone to read a second letter from a second\nsuitor.\n\n\"Angel of light!\" it began, \"but cold as your own fair name.\" Poor\nMary thought it was very nice and very sweet, and though she was so\nmuch afraid of it that she almost wished it away, yet she read it a\nscore of times. Stolen pleasures always are sweet. She had not cared\nto read those two lines from her own betrothed lord above once, or at\nthe most twice; and yet they had been written by a good man,--a man\nsuperlatively good to her, and written too with considerable pain.\n\n[Illustration: The Angel of Light.]\n\nShe sat down all trembling to think of what she was doing; and then,\nas she thought, she read the letter again. \"Angel of light! but cold\nas your own fair name.\" Alas, alas! it was very sweet to her!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nMR. FURNIVAL LOOKS FOR ASSISTANCE.\n\n\n\"And you think that nothing can be done down there?\" said Mr.\nFurnival to his clerk, immediately after the return of Mr. Crabwitz\nfrom Hamworth to London.\n\n\"Nothing at all, sir,\" said Mr. Crabwitz, with laconic significance.\n\n\"Well; I dare say not. If the matter could have been arranged at a\nreasonable cost, without annoyance to my friend Lady Mason, I should\nhave been glad; but, on the whole, it will perhaps be better that the\nlaw should take its course. She will suffer a good deal, but she will\nbe the safer for it afterwards.\"\n\n\"Mr. Furnival, I went so far as to offer a thousand pounds!\"\n\n\"A thousand pounds! Then they'll think we're afraid of them.\"\n\n\"Not a bit more than they did before. Though I offered the money, he\ndoesn't know the least that the offer came from our side. But I'll\ntell you what it is, Mr. Furnival--. I suppose I may speak my mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! But remember this, Crabwitz; Lady Mason is no more in\ndanger of losing the property than you are. It is a most vexatious\nthing, but there can be no doubt as to what the result will be.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Furnival,--I don't know.\"\n\n\"In such matters, I am tolerably well able to form an opinion.\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly!\"\n\n\"And that's my opinion. Now I shall be very glad to hear yours.\"\n\n\"My opinion is this, Mr. Furnival, that Sir Joseph never made that\ncodicil.\"\n\n\"And what makes you think so?\"\n\n\"The whole course of the evidence. It's quite clear there was another\ndeed executed that day, and witnessed by Bolster and Kenneby. Had\nthere been two documents for them to witness, they would have\nremembered it so soon after the occurrence.\"\n\n\"Well, Crabwitz, I differ from you,--differ from you in toto. But\nkeep your opinion to yourself, that's all. I've no doubt you did\nthe best for us you could down at Hamworth, and I'm much obliged to\nyou. You'll find we've got our hands quite full again,--almost too\nfull.\" Then he turned round to his table, and to the papers upon it;\nwhereupon, Crabwitz took the hint, and left the room.\n\nBut when he had gone, Mr. Furnival again raised his eyes from the\npapers on the table, and leaning back in his chair, gave himself up\nto further consideration of the Orley Farm case. Crabwitz he knew was\na sharp, clever man, and now the opinion formed by Crabwitz, after\nhaving seen this Hamworth attorney, tallied with his own opinion.\nYes; it was his own opinion. He had never said as much, even to\nhimself, with those inward words which a man uses when he assures\nhimself of the result of his own thoughts; but he was aware that it\nwas his own opinion. In his heart of hearts, he did believe that that\ncodicil had been fraudulently manufactured by his friend and client,\nLady Mason.\n\nUnder these circumstances, what should he do? He had the handle of\nhis pen between his teeth, as was his habit when he was thinking, and\ntried to bring himself to some permanent resolution.\n\nHow beautiful had she looked while she stood in Sir Peregrine's\nlibrary, leaning on the old man's arm--how beautiful and how\ninnocent! That was the form which his thoughts chiefly took. And then\nshe had given him her hand, and he still felt the soft silken touch\nof her cool fingers. He would not be a man if he could desert a woman\nin such a strait. And such a woman! If even guilty, had she not\nexpiated her guilt by deep sorrow? And then he thought of Mr. Mason\nof Groby Park; and he thought of Sir Peregrine's strong conviction,\nand of Judge Staveley's belief; and he thought also of the strong\nhold which public opinion and twenty years of possession would still\ngive to the cause he favoured. He would still bring her through! Yes;\nin spite of her guilt, if she were guilty; on the strength of her\ninnocency, if she were innocent; but on account of her beauty, and\nsoft hand, and deep liquid eye. So at least he would have owned,\ncould he have been honest enough to tell himself the whole truth.\n\nBut he must prepare himself for the battle in earnest. It was not as\nthough he had been briefed in this case, and had merely to perform\nthe duty for which he had been hired. He was to undertake the\nwhole legal management of the affair. He must settle what attorney\nshould have the matter in hand, and instruct that attorney how to\nreinstruct him, and how to reinstruct those other barristers who must\nnecessarily be employed on the defence, in a case of such magnitude.\nHe did not yet know under what form the attack would be made; but he\nwas nearly certain that it would be done in the shape of a criminal\ncharge. He hoped that it might take the direct form of an accusation\nof forgery. The stronger and more venomous the charge made, the\nstronger also would be public opinion in favour of the accused,\nand the greater the chance of an acquittal. But if she were to be\nfound guilty on any charge, it would matter little on what. Any\nsuch verdict of guilty would be utter ruin and obliteration of her\nexistence.\n\nHe must consult with some one, and at last he made up his mind to go\nto his very old friend, Mr. Chaffanbrass. Mr. Chaffanbrass was safe,\nand he might speak out his mind to him without fear of damaging the\ncause. Not that he could bring himself to speak out his real mind,\neven to Mr. Chaffanbrass. He would so speak that Mr. Chaffanbrass\nshould clearly understand him; but still, not even to his ears, would\nhe say that he really believed Lady Mason to have been guilty. How\nwould it be possible that he should feign before a jury his assured,\nnay, his indignant conviction of his client's innocence, if he had\never whispered to any one his conviction of her guilt?\n\nOn that same afternoon he sent to make an appointment with Mr.\nChaffanbrass, and immediately after breakfast, on the following\nmorning, had himself taken to that gentleman's chambers. The chambers\nof this great guardian of the innocence--or rather not-guiltiness\nof the public--were not in any so-named inn, but consisted of two\ngloomy, dark, panelled rooms in Ely Place. The course of our story,\nhowever, will not cause us to make many visits to Ely Place, and\nany closer description of them may be spared. I have said that Mr.\nChaffanbrass and Mr. Furnival were very old friends. So they were.\nThey had known each other for more than thirty years, and each knew\nthe whole history of the other's rise and progress in the profession;\nbut any results of their friendship at present were but scanty. They\nmight meet each other in the streets, perhaps, once in the year; and\noccasionally--but very seldom--might be brought together on subjects\nconnected with their profession; as was the case when they travelled\ntogether down to Birmingham. As to meeting in each other's houses, or\ncoming together for the sake of the friendship which existed,--the\nidea of doing so never entered the head of either of them.\n\nAll the world knows Mr. Chaffanbrass--either by sight or by\nreputation. Those who have been happy enough to see the face and\ngait of the man as, in years now gone, he used to lord it at the Old\nBailey, may not have thought much of the privilege which was theirs.\nBut to those who have only read of him, and know of his deeds simply\nby their triumphs, he was a man very famous and worthy to be seen.\n\"Look; that's Chaffanbrass. It was he who cross-examined ---- at the\nOld Bailey, and sent him howling out of London, banished for ever\ninto the wilderness.\" \"Where, where? Is that Chaffanbrass? What a\ndirty little man!\"\n\nTo this dirty little man in Ely Place, Mr. Furnival now went in his\ndifficulty. Mr. Furnival might feel himself sufficient to secure the\nacquittal of an innocent person, or even of a guilty person, under\nordinary circumstances; but if any man in England could secure the\nacquittal of a guilty person under extraordinary circumstances, it\nwould be Mr. Chaffanbrass. This had been his special line of work for\nthe last thirty years.\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass was a dirty little man; and when seen without his\ngown and wig, might at a first glance be thought insignificant. But\nhe knew well how to hold his own in the world, and could maintain\nhis opinion, unshaken, against all the judges in the land. \"Well,\nFurnival, and what can I do for you?\" he said, as soon as the member\nfor the Essex Marshes was seated opposite to him. \"It isn't often\nthat the light of your countenance shines so far east as this.\nSomebody must be in trouble, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Somebody is in trouble,\" said Mr. Furnival; and then he began\nto tell his story. Mr. Chaffanbrass listened almost in silence\nthroughout. Now and then he asked a question by a word or two,\nexpressing no opinion whatever as he did so; but he was satisfied to\nleave the talking altogether in the hands of his visitor till the\nwhole tale was told. \"Ah,\" he said then, \"a clever woman!\"\n\n\"An uncommonly sweet creature too,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\n\"I dare say,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass; and then there was a pause.\n\n\"And what can I do for you?\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n\"In the first place I should be very glad to have your advice; and\nthen--. Of course I must lead in defending her,--unless it were well\nthat I should put the case altogether in your hands.\"\n\n\"Oh no! don't think of that. I couldn't give the time to it. My heart\nis not in it, as yours is. Where will it be?\"\n\n\"At Alston, I suppose.\"\n\n\"At the Spring assizes. That will be--. Let me see; about the 10th of\nMarch.\"\n\n\"I should think we might get it postponed till the summer. Round is\nnot at all hot about it.\"\n\n\"Should we gain anything by that? If a prisoner be innocent why\ntorment him by delay. He is tolerably sure of escape. If he be\nguilty, extension of time only brings out the facts the clearer.\nAs far as my experience goes, the sooner a man is tried the\nbetter,--always.\"\n\n\"And you would consent to hold a brief?\"\n\n\"Under you? Well; yes. I don't mind it at Alston. Anything to oblige\nan old friend. I never was proud, you know.\"\n\n\"And what do you think about it, Chaffanbrass?\"\n\n\"Ah! that's the question.\"\n\n\"She must be pulled through. Twenty years of possession! Think of\nthat.\"\n\n\"That's what Mason, the man down in Yorkshire, is thinking of.\nThere's no doubt of course about that partnership deed?\"\n\n\"I fear not. Round would not go on with it if that were not all\ntrue.\"\n\n\"It depends on those two witnesses, Furnival. I remember the case of\nold, though it was twenty years ago, and I had nothing to do with it.\nI remember thinking that Lady Mason was a very clever woman, and that\nRound and Crook were rather slow.\"\n\n\"He's a brute; is that fellow, Mason of Groby Park.\"\n\n\"A brute; is he? We'll get him into the box and make him say as much\nfor himself. She's uncommonly pretty, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She is a pretty woman.\"\n\n\"And interesting? It will all tell, you know. A widow with one son,\nisn't she?\"\n\n\"Yes, and she has done her duty admirably since her husband's death.\nYou will find too that she has the sympathies of all the best\npeople in her neighbourhood. She is staying now at the house of Sir\nPeregrine Orme, who would do anything for her.\"\n\n\"Anything, would he?\"\n\n\"And the Staveleys know her. The judge is convinced of her\ninnocence.\"\n\n\"Is he? He'll probably have the Home Circuit in the summer. His\nconviction expressed from the bench would be more useful to her. You\ncan make Staveley believe everything in a drawing-room or over a\nglass of wine; but I'll be hanged if I can ever get him to believe\nanything when he's on the bench.\"\n\n\"But, Chaffanbrass, the countenance of such people will be of great\nuse to her down there. Everybody will know that she's been staying\nwith Sir Peregrine.\"\n\n\"I've no doubt she's a clever woman.\"\n\n\"But this new trouble has half killed her.\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at that either. These sort of troubles do vex people.\nA pretty woman like that should have everything smooth; shouldn't\nshe? Well, we'll do the best we can. You'll see that I'm properly\ninstructed. By-the-by, who is her attorney? In such a case as that\nyou couldn't have a better man than old Solomon Aram. But Solomon\nAram is too far east from you, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Isn't he a Jew?\"\n\n\"Upon my word I don't know. He's an attorney, and that's enough for\nme.\"\n\nAnd then the matter was again discussed between them, and it was\nagreed that a third counsel would be wanting. \"Felix Graham is very\nmuch interested in the case,\" said Mr. Furnival, \"and is as firmly\nconvinced of her innocence as--as I am.\" And he managed to look his\nally in the face and to keep his countenance firmly.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass. \"But what if he should happen to change\nhis opinion about his own client?\"\n\n\"We could prevent that, I think.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure. And then he'd throw her over as sure as your name's\nFurnival.\"\n\n\"I hardly think he'd do that.\"\n\n\"I believe he'd do anything.\" And Mr. Chaffanbrass was quite moved\nto enthusiasm. \"I've heard that man talk more nonsense about the\nprofession in one hour, than I ever heard before since I first put a\ncotton gown on my back. He does not understand the nature of the duty\nwhich a professional man owes to his client.\"\n\n\"But he'd work well if he had a case at heart himself. I don't like\nhim, but he is clever.\"\n\n\"You can do as you like, of course. I shall be out of my ground down\nat Alston, and of course I don't care who takes the fag of the work.\nBut I tell you this fairly;--if he does go into the case and then\nturns against us or drops it,--I shall turn against him and drop into\nhim.\"\n\n\"Heaven help him in such a case as that!\" And then these two great\nluminaries of the law shook hands and parted.\n\nOne thing was quite clear to Mr. Furnival as he had himself carried\nin a cab from Ely Place to his own chambers in Lincoln's Inn. Mr.\nChaffanbrass was fully convinced of Lady Mason's guilt. He had not\nactually said so, but he had not even troubled himself to go through\nthe little ceremony of expressing a belief in her innocence. Mr.\nFurnival was well aware that Mr. Chaffanbrass would not on this\naccount be less likely to come out strongly with such assurances\nbefore a jury, or to be less severe in his cross-examination of a\nwitness whose evidence went to prove that guilt; but nevertheless\nthe conviction was disheartening. Mr. Chaffanbrass would know, almost\nby instinct, whether an accused person was or was not guilty; and\nhe had already perceived, by instinct, that Lady Mason was guilty.\nMr. Furnival sighed as he stepped out of his cab, and again wished\nthat he could wash his hands of the whole affair. He wished it very\nmuch;--but he knew that his wish could not be gratified.\n\n\"Solomon Aram!\" he said to himself, as he again sat down in his\narm-chair. \"It will sound badly to those people down at Alston. At\nthe Old Bailey they don't mind that kind of thing.\" And then he made\nup his mind that Solomon Aram would not do. It would be a disgrace to\nhim to take a case out of Solomon Aram's hands. Mr. Chaffanbrass\ndid not understand all this. Mr. Chaffanbrass had been dealing with\nSolomon Arams all his life. Mr. Chaffanbrass could not see the effect\nwhich such an alliance would have on the character of a barrister\nholding Mr. Furnival's position. Solomon Aram was a good man in his\nway no doubt;--perhaps the best man going. In taking every dodge to\nprevent a conviction no man could be better than Solomon Aram. All\nthis Mr. Furnival felt;--but he felt also that he could not afford\nit. \"It would be tantamount to a confession of guilt to take such a\nman as that down into the country,\" he said to himself, trying to\nexcuse himself.\n\nAnd then he also made up his mind that he would sound Felix Graham.\nIf Felix Graham could be induced to take up the case thoroughly\nbelieving in the innocence of his client, no man would be more useful\nas a junior. Felix Graham went the Home Circuit on which Alston was\none of the assize towns.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\nLOVE WAS STILL THE LORD OF ALL.\n\n\nWhy should I not? Such had been the question which Sir Peregrine Orme\nhad asked himself over and over again, in these latter days, since\nLady Mason had been staying at his house; and the purport of the\nquestion was this:--Why should he not make Lady Mason his wife?\n\nI and my readers can probably see very many reasons why he should not\ndo so; but then we are not in love with Lady Mason. Her charms and\nher sorrows,--her soft, sad smile and her more lovely tears have not\noperated upon us. We are not chivalrous old gentlemen, past seventy\nyears of age, but still alive, keenly alive, to a strong feeling of\nromance. That visit will perhaps be remembered which Mr. Furnival\nmade at The Cleeve, and the subsequent interview between Lady Mason\nand the baronet. On that day he merely asked himself the question,\nand took no further step. On the subsequent day and the day after,\nit was the same. He still asked himself the question, sitting alone\nin his library; but he did not ask it as yet of any one else. When\nhe met Lady Mason in these days his manner to her was full of the\ndeference due to a lady and of the affection due to a dear friend;\nbut that was all. Mrs. Orme, seeing this, and cordially concurring in\nthis love for her guest, followed the lead which her father-in-law\ngave, and threw herself into Lady Mason's arms. They two were fast\nand bosom friends.\n\nAnd what did Lady Mason think of all this? In truth there was much in\nit that was sweet to her, but there was something also that increased\nthat idea of danger which now seemed to envelop her whole existence.\nWhy had Sir Peregrine so treated her in the library, behaving towards\nher with such tokens of close affection? He had put his arm round her\nwaist and kissed her lips and pressed her to his old bosom. Why had\nthis been so? He had assured her that he would be to her as a father,\nbut her woman's instinct had told her that the pressure of his hand\nhad been warmer than that which a father accords to his adopted\ndaughter. No idea of anger had come upon her for a moment; but she\nhad thought about it much, and had thought about it almost in dismay.\nWhat if the old man did mean more than a father's love? It seemed to\nher as though it must be a dream that he should do so; but what if he\ndid? How should she answer him? In such circumstances what should she\ndo or say? Could she afford to buy his friendship,--even his warmest\nlove at the cost of the enmity of so many others? Would not Mrs. Orme\nhate her, Mrs. Orme, whom she truly, dearly, eagerly loved? Mrs.\nOrme's affection was, of all personal gratifications, the sweetest\nto her. And the young heir,--would not he hate her? Nay, would he\nnot interfere and with some strong hand prevent so mean a deed on the\npart of his grandfather? And if so, would she not thus have lost them\naltogether? And then she thought of that other friend whose aid would\nbe so indispensable to her in this dreadful time of tribulation. How\nwould Mr. Furnival receive such tidings, if it should come to pass\nthat such tidings were to be told?\n\nLady Mason was rich with female charms, and she used them partly with\nthe innocence of the dove, but partly also with the wisdom of the\nserpent. But in such use as she did make of these only weapons which\nProvidence had given to her, I do not think that she can be regarded\nas very culpable. During those long years of her young widowhood in\nwhich nothing had been wanting to her, her conduct had been free from\nany hint of reproach. She had been content to find all her joy in\nher duties and in her love as a mother. Now a great necessity for\nassistance had come upon her. It was necessary that she should bind\nmen to her cause, men powerful in the world and able to fight her\nbattle with strong arms. She did so bind them with the only chains at\nher command,--but she had no thought, nay, no suspicion of evil in so\ndoing. It was very painful to her when she found that she had caused\nunhappiness to Mrs. Furnival; and it caused her pain now, also, when\nshe thought of Sir Peregrine's new love. She did wish to bind these\nmen to her by a strong attachment; but she would have stayed this\nfeeling at a certain point had it been possible for her so to manage\nit.\n\nIn the mean time Sir Peregrine still asked himself that question. He\nhad declared to himself when first the idea had come to him, that\nnone of those whom he loved should be injured. He would even ask his\ndaughter-in-law's consent, condescending to plead his cause before\nher, making her understand his motives, and asking her acquiescence\nas a favour. He would be so careful of his grandson that this second\nmarriage--if such event did come to pass--should not put a pound out\nof his pocket, or at any rate should not hamper the succession of the\nestate with a pound of debt. And then he made excuses to himself as\nto the step which he proposed to take, thinking how he would meet his\nfriends, and how he would carry himself before his old servants.\n\nOld men have made more silly marriages than this which he then\ndesired. Gentlemen such as Sir Peregrine in age and station have\nmarried their housemaids,--have married young girls of eighteen\nyears of age,--have done so and faced their friends and servants\nafterwards. The bride that he proposed to himself was a lady, an old\nfriend, a woman over forty, and one whom by such a marriage he could\ngreatly assist in her deep sorrow. Why should he not do it?\n\nAfter much of such thoughts as these, extended over nearly a week,\nhe resolved to speak his mind to Mrs. Orme. If it were to be done it\nshould be done at once. The incredulous unromantic readers of this\nage would hardly believe me if I said that his main object was to\nrender assistance to Lady Mason in her difficulty; but so he assured\nhimself, and so he believed. This assistance to be of true service\nmust be given at once;--and having so resolved he sent for Mrs. Orme\ninto the library.\n\n\"Edith, my darling,\" he said, taking her hand and pressing it between\nboth his own as was often the wont with him in his more affectionate\nmoods. \"I want to speak to you--on business that concerns me nearly;\nmay perhaps concern us all nearly. Can you give me half an hour?\"\n\n\"Of course I can--what is it, sir? I am a bad hand at business; but\nyou know that.\"\n\n\"Sit down, dear; there; sit there, and I will sit here. As to this\nbusiness, no one can counsel me as well as you.\"\n\n\"Dearest father, I should be a poor councillor in anything.\"\n\n\"Not in this, Edith. It is about Lady Mason that I would speak to\nyou. We both love her dearly; do we not?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"And are glad to have her here?\"\n\n\"Oh, so glad. When this trial is only over, it will be so sweet, to\nhave her for a neighbour. We really know her now. And it will be so\npleasant to see much of her.\"\n\nThere was nothing discouraging in this, but still the words in some\nslight degree grated against Sir Peregrine's feelings. At the present\nmoment he did not wish to think of Lady Mason as living at Orley\nFarm, and would have preferred that his daughter-in-law should have\nspoken of her as being there, at The Cleeve.\n\n\"Yes; we know her now,\" he said. \"And believe me in this, Edith; no\nknowledge obtained of a friend in happiness is at all equal to that\nwhich is obtained in sorrow. Had Lady Mason been prosperous, had she\nnever become subject to the malice and avarice of wicked people, I\nshould never have loved her as I do love her.\"\n\n\"Nor should I, father.\"\n\n\"She is a cruelly ill-used woman, and a woman worthy of the kindest\nusage. I am an old man now, but it has never before been my lot to\nbe so anxious for a fellow-creature as I am for her. It is dreadful\nto think that innocence in this country should be subject to such\nattacks.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is; but you do not think that there is any danger?\"\n\nThis was all very well, and showed that Mrs. Orme's mind was well\ndisposed towards the woman whom he loved. But he had known that\nbefore, and he began to feel that he was not approaching the object\nwhich he had in view. \"Edith,\" at last he said abruptly, \"I love her\nwith my whole heart. I would fain make her--my wife.\" Sir Peregrine\nOrme had never in his course through life failed in anything for lack\nof courage; and when the idea came home to him that he was trembling\nat the task which he had imposed on himself, he dashed at it at once.\nIt is so that forlorn hopes are led, and become not forlorn; it is so\nthat breaches are taken.\n\n\"Your wife!\" said Mrs. Orme. She would not have breathed a syllable\nto pain him if she could have helped it, but the suddenness of the\nannouncement overcame her for a moment.\n\n\"Yes, Edith, my wife. Let us discuss the matter before you condemn\nit. But in the first place I would have you to understand this--I\nwill not marry her if you say that it will make you unhappy. I have\nnot spoken to her as yet, and she knows nothing of this project.\" Sir\nPeregrine, it may be presumed, had not himself thought much of that\nkiss which he had given her. \"You,\" he continued to say, \"have given\nup your whole life to me. You are my angel. If this thing will make\nyou unhappy it shall not be done.\"\n\nSir Peregrine had not so considered it, but with such a woman as Mrs.\nOrme this was, of course, the surest way to overcome opposition. On\nher own behalf, thinking only of herself, she would stand in the\nway of nothing that could add to Sir Peregrine's happiness. But\nnevertheless the idea was strong in her mind that such a marriage\nwould be imprudent. Sir Peregrine at present stood high before the\nworld. Would he stand so high if he did this thing? His gray hair\nand old manly bearing were honoured and revered by all who knew him.\nWould this still be so if he made himself the husband of Lady Mason?\nShe loved so dearly, she valued so highly the honour that was paid\nto him! She was so proud of her own boy in that he was the grandson\nof so perfect a gentleman! Would not this be a sad ending to such\na career? Such were the thoughts which ran through her mind at the\nmoment.\n\n\"Make me unhappy!\" she said getting up and going over to him. \"It is\nyour happiness of which I would think. Will it make you more happy?\"\n\n\"It will enable me to befriend her more effectually.\"\n\n\"But, dearest father, you must be the first consideration to us,--to\nme and Peregrine. Will it make you more happy?\"\n\n\"I think it will,\" he answered slowly.\n\n\"Then I, for one, will say nothing against it,\" she answered. She was\nvery weak, it will be said. Yes, she was weak. Many of the sweetest,\nkindest, best of women are weak in this way. It is not every woman\nthat can bring herself to say hard, useful, wise words in opposition\nto the follies of those they love best. A woman to be useful and wise\nno doubt should have such power. For myself I am not so sure that I\nlike useful and wise women. \"Then I for one will say nothing against\nit,\" said Mrs. Orme, deficient in utility, wanting in wisdom, but\nfull of the sweetest affection.\n\n\"You are sure that you will not love her the less yourself?\" said Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"Yes; I am sure of that. If it were to be so, I should endeavour to\nlove her the more.\"\n\n\"Dearest Edith. I have only one other person to tell.\"\n\n\"Do you mean Peregrine?\" she said in her softest voice.\n\n\"Yes. Of course he must be told. But as it would not be well to ask\nhis consent,--as I have asked yours--\" and then as he said this she\nkissed his brow.\n\n\"But you will let him know it?\"\n\n\"Yes; that is if she accepts my proposition. Then he shall know it\nimmediately. And, Edith, my dear, you may be sure of this; nothing\nthat I do shall be allowed in any way to injure his prospects or to\nhamper him as regards money when I am gone. If this marriage takes\nplace I cannot do very much for her in the way of money; she will\nunderstand that. Something I can of course.\"\n\nAnd then Mrs. Orme stood over the fire, looking at the hot coals, and\nthinking what Lady Mason's answer would be. She esteemed Lady Mason\nvery highly, regarding her as a woman sensible and conscientious at\nall points, and she felt by no means certain that the offer would\nbe accepted. What if Lady Mason should say that such an arrangement\nwould not be possible for her. Mrs. Orme felt that under such\ncircumstances she at any rate would not withdraw her love from Lady\nMason.\n\n\"And now I may as well speak to her at once,\" said Sir Peregrine. \"Is\nshe in the drawing-room?\"\n\n\"I left her there.\"\n\n\"Will you ask her to come to me--with my love?\"\n\n\"I had better not say anything I suppose?\"\n\nSir Peregrine, in his heart of hearts wished that his daughter-in-law\ncould say it all, but he would not give her such a commission. \"No;\nperhaps not.\" And then Mrs. Orme was going to leave him.\n\n\"One word more, Edith. You and I, darling, have known each other so\nlong and loved each other so well, that I should be unhappy if I were\nto fall in your estimation.\"\n\n\"There is no fear of that, father.\"\n\n\"Will you believe me when I assure you that my great object in doing\nthis is to befriend a good and worthy woman whom I regard as ill\nused--beyond all ill usage of which I have hitherto known anything?\"\n\nShe then assured him that she did so believe, and she assured him\ntruly; after that she left him and went away to send in Lady Mason\nfor her interview. In the mean time Sir Peregrine got up and stood\nwith his back to the fire. He would have been glad that the coming\nscene could be over, and yet I should be wronging him to say that\nhe was afraid of it. There would be a pleasure to him in telling\nher that he loved her so dearly and trusted her with such absolute\nconfidence. There would be a sort of pleasure to him in speaking even\nof her sorrow, and in repeating his assurance that he would fight the\nbattle for her with all the means at his command. And perhaps also\nthere would be some pleasure in the downcast look of her eye, as she\naccepted the tender of his love. Something of that pleasure he had\nknown already. And then he remembered the other alternative. It was\nquite upon the cards that she should decline his offer. He did not by\nany means shut his eyes to that. Did she do so, his friendship should\nby no means be withdrawn from her. He would be very careful from the\nonset that she should understand so much as that. And then he heard\nthe light footsteps in the hall; the gentle hand was raised to the\ndoor, and Lady Mason was standing in the room.\n\n\"Dear Lady Mason,\" he said, meeting her half way across the room, \"it\nis very kind of you to come to me when I send for you in this way.\"\n\n\"It would be my duty to come to you, if it were half across the\nkingdom;--and my pleasure also.\"\n\n\"Would it?\" said he, looking into her face with all the wishfulness\nof a young lover. From that moment she knew what was coming. Strange\nas was the destiny which was to be offered to her at this period of\nher life, yet she foresaw clearly that the offer was to be made. What\nshe did not foresee, what she could not foretell, was the answer\nwhich she might make to it!\n\n\"It would certainly be my sweetest pleasure to send for you if you\nwere away from us,--to send for you or to follow you,\" said he.\n\n\"I do not know how to make return for all your kind regard to me;--to\nyou and to dear Mrs. Orme.\"\n\n\"Call her Edith, will you not? You did so call her once.\"\n\n\"I call her so often when we are alone together, now; and yet I feel\nthat I have no right.\"\n\n\"You have every right. You shall have every right if you will accept\nit. Lady Mason, I am an old man,--some would say a very old man. But\nI am not too old to love you. Can, you accept the love of an old man\nlike me?\"\n\nLady Mason was, as we are aware, not taken in the least by surprise;\nbut it was quite necessary that she should seem to be so taken. This\nis a little artifice which is excusable in almost any lady at such\na period. \"Sir Peregrine,\" she said, \"you do not mean more than the\nlove of a most valued friend?\"\n\n\"Yes, much more. I mean the love of a husband for his wife; of a wife\nfor her husband.\"\n\n\"Sir Peregrine! Ah me! You have not thought of this, my friend. You\nhave not remembered the position in which I am placed. Dearest,\ndearest friend; dearest of all friends,\"--and then she knelt before\nhim, leaning on his knees, as he sat in his accustomed large\narm-chair. \"It may not be so. Think of the sorrow that would come to\nyou and yours, if my enemies should prevail.\"\n\n\"By ---- they shall not prevail!\" swore Sir Peregrine, roundly; and\nas he swore the oath he put his two hands upon her shoulders.\n\n\"No; we will hope not. I should die here at your feet if I thought\nthat they could prevail. But I should die twenty deaths were I to\ndrag you with me into disgrace. There will be disgrace even in\nstanding at that bar.\"\n\n\"Who will dare to say so, when I shall stand there with you?\" said\nSir Peregrine.\n\nThere was a feeling expressed in his face as he spoke these words,\nwhich made it glorious, and bright, and beautiful. She, with her eyes\nladen with tears, could not see it; but nevertheless, she knew that\nit was bright and beautiful. And his voice was full of hot eager\nassurance,--that assurance which had the power to convey itself from\none breast to another. Would it not be so? If he stood there with her\nas her husband and lord, would it not be the case that no one would\ndare to impute disgrace to her?\n\nAnd yet she did not wish it. Even yet, thinking of all this as she\ndid think of it, according to the truth of the argument which he\nhimself put before her, she would still have preferred that it should\nnot be so. If she only knew with what words to tell him so;--to tell\nhim so and yet give no offence! For herself, she would have married\nhim willingly. Why should she not? Nay, she could and would have\nloved him, and been to him a wife, such as he could have found in no\nother woman. But she said within her heart that she owed him kindness\nand gratitude--that she owed them all kindness, and that it would\nbe bad to repay them in such a way as this. She also thought of Sir\nPeregrine's gray hairs, and of his proud standing in the county, and\nthe respect in which men held him. Would it be well in her to drag\nhim down in his last days from the noble pedestal on which he stood,\nand repay him thus for all that he was doing for her?\n\n\"Well,\" said he, stroking her soft hair with his hands--the hair\nwhich appeared in front of the quiet prim cap she wore, \"shall it be\nso? Will you give me the right to stand there with you and defend you\nagainst the tongues of wicked men? We each have our own weakness, and\nwe also have each our own strength. There I may boast that I should\nbe strong.\"\n\nShe thought again for a moment or two without rising from her knees,\nand also without speaking. Would such strength suffice? And if it did\nsuffice, would it then be well with him? As for herself, she did love\nhim. If she had not loved him before, she loved him now. Who had ever\nbeen to her so noble, so loving, so gracious as he? In her ears no\nyoung lover's vows had ever sounded. In her heart such love as all\nthe world knows had never been known. Her former husband had been\nkind to her in his way, and she had done her duty by him carefully,\npainfully, and with full acceptance of her position. But there had\nbeen nothing there that was bright, and grand, and noble. She would\nhave served Sir Peregrine on her knees in the smallest offices, and\ndelighted in such services. It was not for lack of love that she must\nrefuse him. But still she did not answer him, and still he stroked\nher hair.\n\n\"It would be better that you had never seen me,\" at last she said;\nand she spoke with truth the thought of her mind. That she must do\nhis bidding, whatever that bidding might be, she had in a certain way\nacknowledged to herself. If he would have it so, so it must be. How\ncould she refuse him anything, or be disobedient in aught to one to\nwhom she owed so much? But still it would be wiser otherwise, wiser\nfor all--unless it were for herself alone. \"It would be better that\nyou had never seen me,\" she said.\n\n\"Nay, not so, dearest. That it would not be better for me,--for me\nand Edith I am quite sure. And I would fain hope that for you--\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir Peregrine! you know what I mean. You know how I value your\nkindness. What should I be if it were withdrawn from me?\"\n\n\"It shall not be withdrawn. Do not let that feeling actuate you.\nAnswer me out of your heart, and however your heart may answer,\nremember this, that my friendship and support shall be the same. If\nyou will take me for your husband, as your husband will I stand by\nyou. If you cannot,--then I will stand by you as your father.\"\n\nWhat could she say? A word or two she did speak as to Mrs. Orme and\nher feelings, delaying her absolute reply--and as to Peregrine Orme\nand his prospects; but on both, as on all other points, the baronet\nwas armed with his answer. He had spoken to his darling Edith, and\nshe had gladly given her consent. To her it would be everything to\nhave so sweet a friend. And then as to his heir, every care should\nbe taken that no injury should be done to him; and speaking of this,\nSir Peregrine began to say a few words, plaintively, about money.\nBut then Lady Mason stopped him. \"No,\" she said, \"she could not,\nand would not, listen to that. She would have no settlement. No\nconsideration as to money should be made to weigh with her. It was\nin no degree for that--\" And then she wept there till she would have\nfallen had he not supported her.\n\nWhat more is there to be told. Of course she accepted him. As far as\nI can see into such affairs no alternative was allowed to her. She\nalso was not a wise woman at all points. She was one whose feelings\nwere sometimes too many for her, and whose feelings on this occasion\nhad been much too many for her. Had she been able to throw aside from\nher his offer, she would have done so; but she had felt that she was\nnot able. \"If you wish it, Sir Peregrine,\" she said at last.\n\n\"And can you love an old man?\" he had asked. Old men sometimes will\nask questions such as these. She did not answer him, but stood by his\nside; and, then again he kissed her, and was happy.\n\nHe resolved from that moment that Lady Mason should no longer be\nregarded as the widow of a city knight, but as the wife elect of a\ncountry baronet. Whatever ridicule he might incur in this matter, he\nwould incur at once. Men and women had dared to speak of her cruelly,\nand they should now learn that any such future speech would be spoken\nof one who was exclusively his property. Let any who chose to be\nspeakers under such circumstances look to it. He had devoted himself\nto her that he might be her knight and bear her scathless through the\nfury of this battle. With God's help he would put on his armour at\nonce for that fight. Let them who would now injure her look to it. As\nsoon as might be she should bear his name; but all the world should\nknow at once what was her right to claim his protection. He had never\nbeen a coward, and he would not now be guilty of the cowardice of\nhiding his intentions. If there were those who chose to smile at the\nold man's fancy, let them smile. There would be many, he knew, who\nwould not understand an old man's honour and an old man's chivalry.\n\n\"My own one,\" he then said, pressing her again to his side, \"will\nyou tell Edith, or shall I? She expects it.\" But Lady Mason begged\nthat he would tell the tale. It was necessary, she said, that she\nshould be alone for a while. And then, escaping, she went to her own\nchamber.\n\n\"Ask Mrs. Orme if she will kindly step to me,\" said Sir Peregrine,\nhaving rang his bell for the servant.\n\nLady Mason escaped across the hall to the stairs, and succeeded in\nreaching her room without being seen by any one. Then she sat herself\ndown, and began to look her future world in the face. Two questions\nshe had to ask. Would it be well for her that this marriage should\ntake place? and would it be well for him? In an off-hand way she\nhad already answered both questions; but she had done so by feeling\nrather than by thought.\n\nNo doubt she would gain much in the coming struggle by such a\nposition as Sir Peregrine would give her. It did seem to her that Mr.\nDockwrath and Joseph Mason would hardly dare to bring such a charge\nas that threatened against the wife of Sir Peregrine Orme. And then,\ntoo, what evidence as to character would be so substantial as the\nevidence of such a marriage? But how would Mr. Furnival bear it,\nand if he were offended would it be possible that the fight should\nbe fought without him? No; that would be impossible. The lawyer's\nknowledge, experience, and skill were as necessary to her as the\nbaronet's position and character. But why should Mr. Furnival be\noffended by such a marriage? \"She did not know,\" she said to herself.\n\"She could not see that there should be cause of offence.\" But yet\nsome inner whisper of her conscience told her that there would be\noffence. Must Mr. Furnival be told; and must he be told at once? And\nthen what would Lucius say and think, and how should she answer the\nstrong words which her son would use to her? He would use strong\nwords she knew, and would greatly dislike this second marriage of his\nmother. What grown-up son is ever pleased to hear that his mother is\nabout to marry? The Cleeve must be her home now--that is, if she did\nthis deed. The Cleeve must be her home, and she must be separated\nin all things from Orley Farm. As she thought of this her mind went\nback, and back to those long gone days in which she had been racked\nwith anxiety that Orley Farm should be the inheritance of the little\nbaby that was lying at her feet. She remembered how she had pleaded\nto the father, pointing out the rights of her son--declaring, and\nwith justice, that for herself she had asked for nothing; but that\nfor him--instead of asking might she not demand? Was not that other\nson provided for, and those grown-up women with their rich husbands?\n\"Is he not your child as well as they?\" she had pleaded. \"Is he not\nyour own, and as well worthy of your love?\" She had succeeded in\ngetting the inheritance for the baby at her feet;--but had his having\nit made her happy, or him? Then her child had been all in all to her;\nbut now she felt that that child was half estranged from her about\nthis very property, and would become wholly estranged by the method\nshe was taking to secure it! \"I have toiled for him,\" she said to\nherself, \"rising up early, and going to bed late; but the thief\ncometh in the night and despoileth it.\" Who can guess the bitterness\nof her thoughts as she said this?\n\nBut her last thoughts, as she sat there thinking, were of him--Sir\nPeregrine. Would it be well for him that he should do this? And in\nthus considering she did not turn her mind chiefly to the usual\nview in which such a marriage would be regarded. Men might call Sir\nPeregrine an old fool and laugh at him; but for that she would, with\nGod's help, make him amends. In those matters, he could judge for\nhimself; and should he judge it right thus to link his life to hers,\nshe would be true and leal to him in all things.\n\nBut then, about this trial. If there came disgrace and ruin, and\nan utter overthrow? If--? Would it not be well at any rate that no\nmarriage should take place till that had been decided? She could not\nfind it in her heart to bring down his old gray hairs with utter\nsorrow to the grave.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nWHAT THE YOUNG MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT.\n\n\nLucius Mason at this time was living at home at Orley Farm, not by\nany means in a happy frame of mind. It will be perhaps remembered\nthat he had at one time had an interview with Mr. Furnival in that\nlawyer's chambers, which was by no means consoling to him, seeing\nthat Mr. Furnival had pooh-poohed him and his pretensions in a very\noff-hand way; and he had since paid a very memorable visit to Mr.\nDockwrath in which he had hardly been more successful. Nevertheless,\nhe had gone to another lawyer. He had felt it impossible to remain\ntranquil, pursuing the ordinary avocations of his life, while such\ndreadful charges were being made openly against his mother, and\nbeing so made without any authorised contradiction. He knew that she\nwas innocent. No doubt on that matter ever perplexed his mind for a\nmoment. But why was she such a coward that she would not allow him\nto protect her innocence in the only way which the law permitted? He\ncould hardly believe that he had no power of doing so even without\nher sanction; and therefore he went to another lawyer.\n\nThe other lawyer did him no good. It was not practicable that he, the\nson, should bring an action for defamatory character on the part of\nthe mother, without that mother's sanction. Moreover, as this new\nlawyer saw in a moment, any such interference on the part of Lucius,\nand any interposition of fresh and new legal proceedings would\ncripple and impede the advisers to whom Lady Mason had herself\nconfided her own case. The new lawyer could do nothing, and thus\nLucius, again repulsed, betook himself to Orley Farm in no happy\nframe of mind.\n\nFor some day or two after this he did not see his mother. He would\nnot go down to The Cleeve, though they sent up and asked him; and she\nwas almost afraid to go across to the house and visit him. \"He will\nbe in church on Sunday,\" she had said to Mrs. Orme. But he was not\nin church on Sunday, and then on Sunday afternoon she did go to him.\nThis, it will be understood, was before Sir Peregrine had made his\noffer, and therefore as to that, there was as yet no embarrassment on\nthe widow's mind.\n\n\"I cannot help feeling, mother,\" he said, after she had sat there\nwith him for a short time, \"that for the present there is a division\nbetween you and me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucius!\"\n\n\"It is no use our denying it to ourselves. It is so. You are in\ntrouble, and you will not listen to my advice. You leave my house and\ntake to the roof of a new and an untried friend.\"\n\n\"No, Lucius; not that.\"\n\n\"Yes. I say a new friend. Twelve months ago, though you might call\nthere, you never did more than that--and even that but seldom. They\nare new friends; and yet, now that you are in trouble, you choose to\nlive with them.\"\n\n\"Dear Lucius, is there any reason why I should not visit at The\nCleeve?\"\n\n\"Yes; if you ask me--yes;\" and now he spoke very sternly. \"There is a\ncloud upon you, and you should know nothing of visitings and of new\nfriendships till that cloud has been dispersed. While these things\nare being said of you, you should set at no other table than this,\nand drink of no man's cup but mine. I know your innocence,\" and as\nhe went on to speak, he stood up before her and looked down fully\ninto her face, \"but others do not. I know how unworthy are these\nfalsehoods with which wicked men strive to crush you, but others\nbelieve that they are true accusations. They cannot be disregarded,\nand now it seems,--now that you have allowed them to gather to a\nhead, they will result in a trial, during which you will have to\nstand at the bar charged with a dreadful crime.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucius!\" and she hid her eyes in her hands. \"I could not have\nhelped it. How could I have helped it?\"\n\n\"Well; it must be so now. And till that trial is over, here should\nbe your place. Here, at my right hand; I am he who am bound to stand\nby you. It is I whose duty it is to see that your name be made white\nagain, though I spend all I have, ay, and my life in doing it. I am\nthe one man on whose arm you have a right to lean. And yet, in such\ndays as these, you leave my house and go to that of a stranger.\"\n\n\"He is not a stranger, Lucius.\"\n\n\"He cannot be to you as a son should be. However, it is for you to\njudge. I have no control in this matter, but I think it right that\nyou should know what are my thoughts.\"\n\nAnd then she had crept back again to The Cleeve. Let Lucius say what\nhe might, let this additional sorrow be ever so bitter, she could not\nobey her son's behests. If she did so in one thing she must do so in\nall. She had chosen her advisers with her best discretion, and by\nthat choice she must abide--even though it separated her from her\nson. She could not abandon Sir Peregrine Orme and Mr. Furnival. So\nshe crept back and told all this to Mrs. Orme. Her heart would have\nutterly sunk within her could she not have spoken openly to some one\nof this sorrow.\n\n\"But he loves you,\" Mrs. Orme had said, comforting her. \"It is not\nthat he does not love you.\"\n\n\"But he is so stern to me.\" And then Mrs. Orme had kissed her, and\npromised that none should be stern to her, there, in that house. On\nthe morning after this Sir Peregrine had made his offer, and then\nshe felt that the division between her and her boy would be wider\nthan ever. And all this had come of that inheritance which she had\ndemanded so eagerly for her child.\n\nAnd now Lucius was sitting alone in his room at Orley Farm, having,\nfor the present, given up all idea of attempting anything himself by\nmeans of the law. He had made his way into Mr. Dockwrath's office,\nand had there insulted the attorney in the presence of witnesses. His\nhope now was that the attorney might bring an action against him. If\nthat were done he would thus have the means of bringing out all the\nfacts of the case before a jury and a judge. It was fixed in his mind\nthat if he could once drag that reptile before a public tribunal,\nand with loud voice declare the wrong that was being done, all might\nbe well. The public would understand and would speak out, and the\nreptile would be scorned and trodden under foot. Poor Lucius! It\nis not always so easy to catch public sympathy, and it will occur\nsometimes that the wrong reptile is crushed by the great public heel.\n\n[Illustration: Lucius Mason in his Study.]\n\nHe had his books before him as he sat there--his Latham and his\nPritchard, and he had the jawbone of one savage and the skull of\nanother. His Liverpool bills for unadulterated guano were lying on\nthe table, and a philosophical German treatise on agriculture which\nhe had resolved to study. It became a man, he said to himself, to do\na man's work in spite of any sorrow. But, nevertheless, as he sat\nthere, his studies were but of little service to him. How many men\nhave declared to themselves the same thing, but have failed when the\ntrial came! Who, can command the temper and the mind? At ten I will\nstrike the lyre and begin my poem. But at ten the poetic spirit is\nunder a dark cloud--because the water for the tea had not boiled when\nit was brought in at nine. And so the lyre remains unstricken.\n\nAnd Lucius found that he could not strike his lyre. For days he had\nsat there and no good note had been produced. And then he had walked\nover his land, having a farming man at his heels, thinking that he\ncould turn his mind to the actual and practical working of his land.\nBut little good had come of that either. It was January, and the land\nwas sloppy and half frozen. There was no useful work to be done on\nit. And then what farmer Greenwood had once said of him was true\nenough, \"The young maister's spry and active surely, but he can't let\nunself down to stable doong and the loik o' that.\" He had some grand\nidea of farming--a conviction that the agricultural world in general\nwas very backward, and that he would set it right. Even now in his\nsorrow, as he walked through his splashy, frozen fields, he was\ntormented by a desire to do something, he knew not what, that might\nbe great.\n\nHe had no such success on the present occasion and returned\ndisconsolate to the house. This happened about noon on the day after\nthat on which Sir Peregrine had declared himself. He returned as\nI have said to the house, and there at the kitchen door he met a\nlittle girl whom he knew well as belonging to The Cleeve. She was a\nfavourite of Mrs. Orme's, was educated and clothed by her, and ran\non her messages. Now she had brought a letter up to Lucius from his\nmother. Curtsying low she so told him, and he at once went into the\nsitting-room where he found it lying on his table. His hand was\nnervous as he opened it; but if he could have seen how tremulous had\nbeen the hand that wrote it! The letter was as follows:--\n\n\n   DEAREST LUCIUS,\n\n   I know you will be very much surprised at what I am going\n   to tell you, but I hope you will not judge me harshly.\n   If I know myself at all I would take no step of any kind\n   for my own advantage which could possibly injure you. At\n   the present moment we unfortunately do not agree about a\n   subject which is troubling us both, and I cannot therefore\n   consult you as I should otherwise have done. I trust that\n   by God's mercy these troubles may come to an end, and that\n   there may be no further differences between you and me.\n\n   Sir Peregrine Orme has made me an offer of marriage and I\n   have accepted it--\n\nLucius Mason when he had read so far threw down the letter upon the\ntable, and rising suddenly from his chair walked rapidly up and\ndown the room. \"Marry him!\" he said out loud, \"marry him!\" The idea\nthat their fathers and mothers should marry and enjoy themselves is\nalways a thing horrible to be thought of in the minds of the rising\ngeneration. Lucius Mason now began to feel against his mother the\nsame sort of anger which Joseph Mason had felt when his father had\nmarried again. \"Marry him!\" And then he walked rapidly about the\nroom, as though some great injury had been threatened to him.\n\nAnd so it had, in his estimation. Was it not her position in life to\nbe his mother? Had she not had her young days? But it did not occur\nto him to think what those young days had been. And this then was the\nmeaning of her receding from his advice and from his roof! She had\nbeen preparing for herself in the world new hopes, a new home, and a\nnew ambition. And she had so prevailed upon the old man that he was\nabout to do this foolish thing! Then again he walked up and down the\nroom, injuring his mother much in his thoughts. He gave her credit\nfor none of those circumstances which had truly actuated her in\naccepting the hand which Sir Peregrine had offered her. In that\nmatter touching the Orley Farm estate he could acquit his mother\ninstantly,--with acclamation. But in this other matter he had\npronounced her guilty before she had been allowed to plead. Then he\ntook up the letter and finished it.\n\n   Sir Peregrine Orme has made me an offer of marriage and\n   I have accepted it. It is very difficult to explain in a\n   letter all the causes that have induced me to do so. The\n   first perhaps is this, that I feel myself so bound to him\n   by love and gratitude, that I think it my duty to fall in\n   with all his wishes. He has pointed out to me that as my\n   husband he can do more for me than would be possible for\n   him without that name. I have explained to him that I\n   would rather perish than that he should sacrifice himself;\n   but he is pleased to say that it is no sacrifice. At any\n   rate he so wishes it, and as Mrs. Orme has cordially\n   assented, I feel myself bound to fall in with his views.\n   It was only yesterday that Sir Peregrine made his offer. I\n   mention this that you may know that I have lost no time in\n   telling you.\n\n   Dearest Lucius, believe that I shall be as ever\n   Your most affectionate mother,\n\n   MARY MASON.\n\n   The little girl will wait for an answer if she finds that\n   you are at the farm.\n\n\n\"No,\" he said to himself, still walking about the room. \"She can\nnever be to me the same mother that she was. I would have sacrificed\neverything for her. She should have been the mistress of my house, at\nany rate till she herself should have wished it otherwise. But now--\"\nAnd then his mind turned away suddenly to Sophia Furnival.\n\nI cannot myself but think that had that affair of the trial been set\nat rest Lady Mason would have been prudent to look for another home.\nThe fact that Orley Farm was his house and not hers occurred almost\ntoo frequently to Lucius Mason; and I am not certain that it would\nhave been altogether comfortable as a permanent residence for his\nmother after he should have brought home to it some such bride as her\nhe now proposed to himself.\n\nIt was necessary that he should write an answer to his mother, which\nhe did at once.\n\n\n   Orley Farm, -- January.\n\n   DEAR MOTHER,\n\n   It is I fear too late for me to offer any counsel on the\n   subject of your letter. I cannot say that I think you are\n   right.\n\n   Your affectionate son,\n\n   LUCIUS MASON.\n\n\nAnd then, having finished this, he again walked the room. \"It is all\nup between me and her,\" he said, \"as real friends in life and heart.\nShe shall still have the respect of a son, and I shall have the\nregard of a mother. But how can I trim my course to suit the welfare\nof the wife of Sir Peregrine Orme?\" And then he lashed himself into\nanger at the idea that his mother should have looked for other solace\nthan that which he could have given.\n\nNothing more from The Cleeve reached him that day; but early on\nthe following morning he had a visitor whom he certainly had not\nexpected. Before he sat down to his breakfast he heard the sound of\na horse's feet before the door, and immediately afterwards Peregrine\nOrme entered the sitting-room. He was duly shown in by the servant,\nand in his ordinary way came forward quickly and shook hands. Then he\nwaited till the door was closed, and at once began upon the subject\nwhich had brought him there.\n\n\"Mason,\" he said, \"you have heard of this that is being done at The\nCleeve?\"\n\nLucius immediately fell back a step or two, and considered for a\nmoment how he should answer. He had pressed very heavily on his\nmother in his own thoughts, but he was not prepared to hear her\nharshly spoken of by another.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"I have heard.\"\n\n\"And I understand from your mother that you do not approve of it.\"\n\n\"Approve of it! No; I do not approve of it.\"\n\n\"Nor by heavens do I!\"\n\n\"I do not approve of it,\" said Mason, speaking with deliberation;\n\"but I do not know that I can take any steps towards preventing it.\"\n\n\"Cannot you see her, and talk to her, and tell her how wrong it is?\"\n\n\"Wrong! I do not know that she is wrong in that sense. I do not know\nthat you have any right to blame her. Why do not you speak to your\ngrandfather?\"\n\n\"So I have--as far as it was possible for me. But you do not know Sir\nPeregrine. No one has any influence over him, but my mother;--and now\nalso your mother.\"\n\n\"And what does Mrs. Orme say?\"\n\n\"She will say nothing. I know well that she disapproves of it. She\nmust disapprove of it, though she will not say so. She would rather\nburn off both her hands than displease my grandfather. She says that\nhe asked her and that she consented.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that it is for her and you to prevent this.\"\n\n\"No; it is for your mother to prevent it. Only think of it, Mason.\nHe is over seventy, and, as he says himself, he will not burden the\nestate with a new jointure. Why should she do it?\"\n\n\"You are wronging her there. It is no affair of money. She is not\ngoing to marry him for what she can get.\"\n\n\"Then why should she do it?\"\n\n\"Because he tells her. These troubles about the lawsuit have turned\nher head, and she has put herself entirely into his hands. I think\nshe is wrong. I could have protected her from all this evil, and\nwould have done so. I could have done more, I think, than Sir\nPeregrine can do. But she has thought otherwise, and I do not know\nthat I can help it.\"\n\n\"But will you speak to her? Will make her perceive that she is\ninjuring a family that is treating her with kindness?\"\n\n\"If she will come here I will speak to her. I cannot do it there. I\ncannot go down to your grandfather's house with such an object as\nthat.\"\n\n\"All the world will turn against her if she marries him,\" said\nPeregrine. And then there was silence between them for a moment or\ntwo.\n\n\"It seems to me,\" said Lucius at last, \"that you wrong my mother very\nmuch in this matter, and lay all the blame where but the smallest\npart of the blame is deserved. She has no idea of money in her mind,\nor any thought of pecuniary advantage. She is moved solely by what\nyour grandfather has said to her,--and by an insane dread of some\ncoming evil which she thinks may be lessened by his assistance. You\nare in the house with them, and can speak to him,--and if you please\nto her also. I do not see that I can do either.\"\n\n\"And you will not help me to break it off?\"\n\n\"Certainly,--if I can see my way.\"\n\n\"Will you write to her?\"\n\n\"Well; I will think about it.\"\n\n\"Whether she be to blame or not it must be your duty as well as mine\nto prevent such a marriage if it be possible. Think what people will\nsay of it?\"\n\nAfter some further discussion Peregrine remounted his horse, and rode\nback to The Cleeve, not quite satisfied with young Mason.\n\n\"If you do speak to her,--to my mother, do it gently.\" Those were the\nlast words whispered by Lucius as Peregrine Orme had his foot in the\nstirrup.\n\nYoung Peregrine Orme, as he rode home, felt that the world was using\nhim very unkindly. Everything was going wrong with him, and an idea\nentered his head that he might as well go and look for Sir John\nFranklin at the North Pole, or join some energetic traveller in the\nmiddle of Central Africa. He had proposed to Madeline Staveley and\nhad been refused. That in itself caused a load to lie on his heart\nwhich was almost unendurable;--and now his grandfather was going to\ndisgrace himself. He had made his little effort to be respectable\nand discreet, devoting himself to the county hunt and county\ndrawing-rooms, giving up the pleasures of London and the glories of\ndissipation. And for what?\n\nThen Peregrine began to argue within himself as some others have done\nbefore him--\n\n\"Were it not better done as others use--\" he said to himself, in that\nor other language; and as he rode slowly into the courtyard of The\nCleeve, he thought almost with regret of his old friend Carroty Bob.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nPEREGRINE'S ELOQUENCE.\n\n\nIn the last chapter Peregrine Orme called at Orley Farm with the\nview of discussing with Lucius Mason the conduct of their respective\nprogenitors; and, as will be remembered, the young men agreed in\na general way that their progenitors were about to make fools of\nthemselves. Poor Peregrine, however, had other troubles on his mind.\nNot only had his grandfather been successful in love, but he had\nbeen unsuccessful. As he had journeyed home from Noningsby to The\nCleeve in a high-wheeled vehicle which he called his trap, he had\ndetermined, being then in a frame of mind somewhat softer than was\nusual with him, to tell all his troubles to his mother. It sounds as\nthough it were lack-a-daisical--such a resolve as this on the part\nof a dashing young man, who had been given to the pursuit of rats,\nand was now a leader among the sons of Nimrod in the pursuit of\nfoxes. Young men of the present day, when got up for the eyes of the\nworld, look and talk as though they could never tell their mothers\nanything,--as though they were harder than flint, and as little in\nwant of a woman's counsel and a woman's help as a colonel of horse\non the morning of a battle. But the rigid virility of his outward\naccoutrements does in no way alter the man of flesh and blood who\nwears them; the young hero, so stern to the eye, is, I believe, as\noften tempted by stress of sentiment to lay bare the sorrow of his\nheart as is his sister. On this occasion Peregrine said to himself\nthat he would lay bare the sorrow of his heart. He would find out\nwhat others thought of that marriage which he had proposed to\nhimself; and then, if his mother encouraged him, and his grandfather\napproved, he would make another attack, beginning on the side of the\njudge, or perhaps on that of Lady Staveley.\n\nBut he found that others, as well as he, were labouring under a\nstress of sentiment; and when about to tell his own tale, he had\nlearned that a tale was to be told to him. He had dined with Lady\nMason, his mother, and his grandfather, and the dinner had been very\nsilent. Three of the party were in love, and the fourth was burdened\nwith the telling of the tale. The baronet himself said nothing on the\nsubject as he and his grandson sat over their wine; but later in the\nevening Peregrine was summoned to his mother's room, and she, with\nconsiderable hesitation and much diffidence, informed him of the\ncoming nuptials.\n\n\"Marry Lady Mason!\" he had said.\n\n\"Yes, Peregrine. Why should he not do so if they both wish it?\"\n\nPeregrine thought that there were many causes and impediments\nsufficiently just why no such marriage should take place, but he\nhad not his arguments ready at his fingers' ends. He was so stunned\nby the intelligence that he could say but little about it on that\noccasion. By the few words that he did say, and by the darkness of\nhis countenance, he showed plainly enough that he disapproved. And\nthen his mother said all that she could in the baronet's favour,\npointing out that in a pecuniary way Peregrine would receive benefit\nrather than injury.\n\n\"I'm not thinking of the money, mother.\"\n\n\"No, my dear; but it is right that I should tell you how considerate\nyour grandfather is.\"\n\n\"All the same, I wish he would not marry this woman.\"\n\n\"Woman, Peregrine! You should not speak in that way of a friend whom\nI dearly love.\"\n\n\"She is a woman all the same.\" And then he sat sulkily looking at the\nfire. His own stress of sentiment did not admit of free discussion\nat the present moment, and was necessarily postponed. On that other\naffair he was told that his grandfather would be glad to see him on\nthe following morning; and then he left his mother.\n\n\"Your grandfather, Peregrine, asked for my assent,\" said Mrs. Orme;\n\"and I thought it right to give it.\" This she said to make him\nunderstand that it was no longer in her power to oppose the match.\nAnd she was thoroughly glad that this was so, for she would have\nlacked the courage to oppose Sir Peregrine in anything.\n\nOn the next morning Peregrine saw his grandfather before breakfast.\nHis mother came to his room door while he was dressing to whisper\na word of caution to him. \"Pray, be courteous to him,\" she\nsaid. \"Remember how good he is to you--to us both! Say that you\ncongratulate him.\"\n\n\"But I don't,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"Ah, but, Peregrine--\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do, mother. I'll leave the house altogether\nand go away, if you wish it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Peregrine! How can you speak in that way? But he's waiting now.\nPray, pray, be kind in your manner to him.\"\n\nHe descended with the same sort of feeling which had oppressed him on\nhis return home after his encounter with Carroty Bob in Smithfield.\nSince then he had been on enduring good terms with his grandfather,\nbut now again all the discomforts of war were imminent.\n\n\"Good morning, sir,\" he said, on going into his grandfather's\ndressing-room.\n\n\"Good morning, Peregrine.\" And then there was silence for a moment or\ntwo.\n\n\"Did you see your mother last night?\"\n\n\"Yes; I did see her.\"\n\n\"And she told you what it is that I propose to do?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; she told me.\"\n\n\"I hope you understand, my boy, that it will not in any way affect\nyour own interests injuriously.\"\n\n\"I don't care about that, sir--one way or the other.\"\n\n\"But I do, Peregrine. Having seen to that I think that I have a right\nto please myself in this matter.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, sir; I know you have the right.\"\n\n\"Especially as I can benefit others. Are you aware that your mother\nhas cordially given her consent to the marriage?\"\n\n\"She told me that you had asked her, and that she had agreed to it.\nShe would agree to anything.\"\n\n\"Peregrine, that is not the way in which you should speak of your\nmother.\"\n\nAnd then the young man stood silent, as though there was nothing more\nto be said. Indeed, he had nothing more to say. He did not dare to\nbring forward in words all the arguments against the marriage which\nwere now crowding themselves into his memory, but he could not induce\nhimself to wish the old man joy, or to say any of those civil things\nwhich are customary on such occasions. The baronet sat for a while,\nsilent also, and a cloud of anger was coming across his brow; but he\nchecked that before he spoke. \"Well, my boy,\" he said, and his voice\nwas almost more than usually kind, \"I can understand your thoughts,\nand we will say nothing of them at present. All I will ask of you is\nto treat Lady Mason in a manner befitting the position in which I\nintend to place her.\"\n\n\"If you think it will be more comfortable, sir, I will leave The\nCleeve for a time.\"\n\n\"I hope that may not be necessary--Why should it? Or at any rate, not\nas yet,\" he added, as a thought as to his wedding day occurred to\nhim. And then the interview was over, and in another half-hour they\nmet again at breakfast.\n\nIn the breakfast-room Lady Mason was also present. Peregrine was the\nlast to enter, and as he did so his grandfather was already standing\nin his usual place, with the book of Prayers in his hand, waiting\nthat the servants should arrange themselves at their chairs before he\nknelt down. There was no time then for much greeting, but Peregrine\ndid shake hands with her as he stept across to his accustomed corner.\nHe shook hands with her, and felt that her hand was very cold; but he\ndid not look at her, nor did he hear any answer given to his muttered\nwords. When they all got up she remained close to Mrs. Orme, as\nthough she might thus be protected from the anger which she feared\nfrom Sir Peregrine's other friends. And at breakfast also she sat\nclose to her, far away from the baronet, and almost hidden by the urn\nfrom his grandson. Sitting there she said nothing; neither in truth\ndid she eat anything. It was a time of great suffering to her, for\nshe knew that her coming could not be welcomed by the young heir. \"It\nmust not be,\" she said to herself over and over again. \"Though he\nturn me out of the house, I must tell him that it cannot be so.\"\n\nAfter breakfast Peregrine had ridden over to Orley Farm, and there\nheld his consultation with the other heir. On his returning to The\nCleeve, he did not go into the house, but having given up his horse\nto a groom, wandered away among the woods. Lucius Mason had suggested\nthat he, Peregrine Orme, should himself speak to Lady Mason on this\nmatter. He felt that his grandfather would be very angry, should he\ndo so. But he did not regard that much. He had filled himself full\nwith the theory of his duties, and he would act up to it. He would\nsee her, without telling any one what was his purpose, and put it\nto her whether she would bring down this destruction on so noble a\ngentleman. Having thus resolved, he returned to the house, when it\nwas already dark, and making his way into the drawing-room, sat\nhimself down before the fire, still thinking of his plan. The room\nwas dark, as such rooms are dark for the last hour or two before\ndinner in January, and he sat himself in an arm-chair before the\nfire, intending to sit there till it would be necessary that he\nshould go to dress. It was an unaccustomed thing with him so to place\nhimself at such a time, or to remain in the drawing-room at all till\nhe came down for a few minutes before dinner; but he did so now,\nhaving been thrown out of his usual habits by the cares upon his\nmind. He had been so seated about a quarter of an hour, and was\nalready nearly asleep, when he heard the rustle of a woman's garment,\nand looking round, with such light as the fire gave him, perceived\nthat Lady Mason was in the room. She had entered very quietly, and\nwas making her way in the dark to a chair which she frequently\noccupied, between the fire and one of the windows, and in doing so\nshe passed so near Peregrine as to touch him with her dress.\n\n\"Lady Mason,\" he said, speaking, in the first place, in order that\nshe might know that she was not alone, \"it is almost dark; shall I\nring for candles for you?\"\n\nShe started at hearing his voice, begged his pardon for disturbing\nhim, declined his offer of light, and declared that she was going up\nagain to her own room immediately. But it occurred to him that if it\nwould be well that he should speak to her, it would be well that he\nshould do so at once; and what opportunity could be more fitting than\nthe present? \"If you are not in a hurry about anything,\" he said,\n\"would you mind staying here for a few minutes?\"\n\n\"Oh no, certainly not.\" But he could perceive that her voice trembled\nin uttering even these few words.\n\n\"I think I'd better light a candle,\" he said; and then he did light\none of those which stood on the corner of the mantelpiece,--a\nsolitary candle, which only seemed to make the gloom of the large\nroom visible. She, however, was standing close to it, and would have\nmuch preferred that the room should have been left to its darkness.\n\n\"Won't you sit down for a few minutes?\" and then she sat down. \"I'll\njust shut the door, if you don't mind.\" And then, having done so, he\nreturned to his own chair and again faced the fire. He saw that she\nwas pale and nervous, and he did not like to look at her as he spoke.\nHe began to reflect also that they might probably be interrupted by\nhis mother, and he wished that they could adjourn to some other room.\nThat, however, seemed to be impossible; so he summoned up all his\ncourage, and began his task.\n\n\"I hope you won't think me uncivil, Lady Mason, for speaking to you\nabout this affair.\"\n\n\"Oh no, Mr. Orme; I am sure that you will not be uncivil to me.\"\n\n\"Of course I cannot help feeling a great concern in it, for it's very\nnearly the same, you know, as if he were my father. Indeed, if you\ncome to that, it's almost worse; and I can assure you it is nothing\nabout money that I mind. Many fellows in my place would be afraid\nabout that, but I don't care twopence what he does in that respect.\nHe is so honest and so noble-hearted, that I am sure he won't do me a\nwrong.\"\n\n\"I hope not, Mr. Orme; and certainly not in respect to me.\"\n\n\"I only mention it for fear you should misunderstand me. But there\nare other reasons, Lady Mason, why this marriage will make me--make\nme very unhappy.\"\n\n\"Are there? I shall be so unhappy if I make others unhappy.\"\n\n\"You will then,--I can assure you of that. It is not only me, but\nyour own son. I was up with him to-day, and he thinks of it the same\nas I do.\"\n\n\"What did he say, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"What did he say? Well, I don't exactly remember his words; but he\nmade me understand that your marriage with Sir Peregrine would make\nhim very unhappy. He did indeed. Why do you not see him yourself, and\ntalk to him?\"\n\n\"I thought it best to write to him in the first place.\"\n\n\"Well, now you have written; and don't you think it would be well\nthat you should go up and see him? You will find that he is quite as\nstrong against it as I am,--quite.\"\n\nPeregrine, had he known it, was using the arguments which were of all\nthe least likely to induce Lady Mason to pay a visit to Orley Farm.\nShe dreaded the idea of a quarrel with her son, and would have made\nalmost any sacrifice to prevent such a misfortune; but at the present\nmoment she feared the anger of his words almost more than the anger\nimplied by his absence. If this trial could be got over, she would\nreturn to him and almost throw herself at his feet; but till that\ntime, might it not be well that they should be apart? At any rate,\nthese tidings of his discontent could not be efficacious in inducing\nher to seek him.\n\n\"Dear Lucius!\" she said, not addressing herself to her companion, but\nspeaking her thoughts. \"I would not willingly give him cause to be\ndiscontented with me.\"\n\n\"He is, then, very discontented. I can assure you of that.\"\n\n\"Yes; he and I think differently about all this.\"\n\n\"Ah, but don't you think you had better speak to him before you quite\nmake up your mind? He is your son, you know; and an uncommon clever\nfellow too. He'll know how to say all this much better than I do.\"\n\n\"Say what, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"Why, of course you can't expect that anybody will like such a\nmarriage as this;--that is, anybody except you and Sir Peregrine.\"\n\n\"Your mother does not object to it.\"\n\n\"My mother! But you don't know my mother yet. She would not object to\nhave her head cut off if anybody wanted it that she cared about. I\ndo not know how it has all been managed, but I suppose Sir Peregrine\nasked her. Then of course she would not object. But look at the\ncommon sense of it, Lady Mason. What does the world always say when\nan old man like my grandfather marries a young woman?\"\n\n\"But I am not--.\" So far she got, and then she stopped herself.\n\n\"We have all liked you very much. I'm sure I have for one; and I'll\ngo in for you, heart and soul, in this shameful law business. When\nLucius asked me, I didn't think anything of going to that scoundrel\nin Hamworth; and all along I've been delighted that Sir Peregrine\ntook it up. By heavens! I'd be glad to go down to Yorkshire myself,\nand walk into that fellow that wants to do you this injury. I would\nindeed; and I'll stand by you as strong as anybody. But, Lady Mason,\nwhen it comes to one's grandfather marrying, it--it--it--. Think what\npeople in the county will say of him. If it was your father, and if\nhe had been at the top of the tree all his life, how would you like\nto see him get a fall, and be laughed at as though he were in the mud\njust when he was too old ever to get up again?\"\n\nI am not sure whether Lucius Mason, with all his cleverness, could\nhave put the matter much better, or have used a style of oratory more\nefficacious to the end in view. Peregrine had drawn his picture with\na coarse pencil, but he had drawn it strongly, and with graphic\neffect. And then he paused; not with self-confidence, or as giving\nhis companion time to see how great had been his art, but in want of\nwords, and somewhat confused by the strength of his own thoughts. So\nhe got up and poked the fire, turning his back to it, and then sat\ndown again. \"It is such a deuce of a thing, Lady Mason,\" he said,\n\"that you must not be angry with me for speaking out.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Orme, I am not angry, and I do not know what to say to you.\"\n\n\"Why don't you speak to Lucius?\"\n\n\"What could he say more than you have said? Dear Mr. Orme, I would\nnot injure him,--your grandfather, I mean,--for all that the world\nholds.\"\n\n\"You will injure him;--in the eyes of all his friends.\"\n\n\"Then I will not do it. I will go to him, and beg him that it may not\nbe so. I will tell him that I cannot. Anything will be better than\nbringing him to sorrow or disgrace.\"\n\n\"By Jove! but will you really?\" Peregrine was startled and almost\nfrightened at the effect of his own eloquence. What would the baronet\nsay when he learned that he had been talked out of his wife by his\ngrandson?\n\n\"Mr. Orme,\" continued Lady Mason, \"I am sure you do not understand\nhow this matter has been brought about. If you did, however much it\nmight grieve you, you would not blame me, even in your thoughts.\nFrom the first to the last my only desire has been to obey your\ngrandfather in everything.\"\n\n\"But you would not marry him out of obedience?\"\n\n\"I would--and did so intend. I would, certainly; if in doing so I did\nhim no injury. You say that your mother would give her life for him.\nSo would I;--that or anything else that I could give, without hurting\nhim or others. It was not I that sought for this marriage; nor did I\nthink of it. If you were in my place, Mr. Orme, you would know how\ndifficult it is to refuse.\"\n\nPeregrine again got up, and standing with his back to the fire,\nthought over it all again. His soft heart almost relented towards the\nwoman who had borne his rough words with so much patient kindness.\nHad Sir Peregrine been there then, and could he have condescended so\nfar, he might have won his grandson's consent without much trouble.\nPeregrine, like some other generals, had expended his energy in\ngaining his victory, and was more ready now to come to easy terms\nthan he would have been had he suffered in the combat.\n\n[Illustration: Peregrine's Eloquence.]\n\n\"Well,\" he said after a while, \"I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you\nfor the manner in which you have taken what I said to you. Nobody\nknows about it yet, I suppose; and perhaps, if you will talk to the\ngovernor--\"\n\n\"I will talk to him, Mr. Orme.\"\n\n\"Thank you; and then perhaps all things may turn out right. I'll go\nand dress now.\" And so saying he took his departure, leaving her to\nconsider how best she might act at this crisis of her life, so that\nthings might go right, if such were possible. The more she thought of\nit, the less possible it seemed that her affairs should be made to go\nright.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nOH, INDEED!\n\n\nThe dinner on that day at The Cleeve was not very dull. Peregrine had\nsome hopes that the idea of the marriage might be abandoned, and was\nat any rate much better disposed towards Lady Mason than he had been.\nHe spoke to her, asking her whether she had been out, and suggesting\nroast mutton or some such creature comfort. This was lost neither on\nSir Peregrine nor on Mrs. Orme, and they both exerted themselves to\nsay a few words in a more cheery tone than had been customary in the\nhouse for the last day or two. Lady Mason herself did not say much;\nbut she had sufficient tact to see the effort which was being made;\nand though she spoke but little she smiled and accepted graciously\nthe courtesies that were tendered to her.\n\nThen the two ladies went away, and Peregrine was again left with his\ngrandfather. \"That was a nasty accident that Graham had going out of\nMonkton Grange,\" said he, speaking on the moment of his closing the\ndining-room door after his mother. \"I suppose you heard all about\nit, sir?\" Having fought his battle so well before dinner, he was\ndetermined to give some little rest to his half-vanquished enemy.\n\n\"The first tidings we heard were that he was dead,\" said Sir\nPeregrine, filling his glass.\n\n\"No; he wasn't dead. But of course you know that now. He broke an arm\nand two ribs, and got rather a bad squeeze. He was just behind me,\nyou know, and I had to wait for him. I lost the run, and had to see\nHarriet Tristram go away with the best lead any one has had to a\nfast thing this year. That's an uncommon nasty place at the back of\nMonkton Grange.\"\n\n\"I hope, Peregrine, you don't think too much about Harriet Tristram.\"\n\n\"Think of her! who? I? Think of her in what sort of a way? I think\nshe goes uncommonly well to hounds.\"\n\n\"That may be, but I should not wish to see you pin your happiness on\nany lady that was celebrated chiefly for going well to hounds.\"\n\n\"Do you mean marry her?\" and Peregrine immediately made a strong\ncomparison in his mind between Miss Tristram and Madeline Staveley.\n\n\"Yes; that's what I did mean.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have her if she owned every fox-cover in the county. No,\nby Jove! I know a trick worth two of that. It's jolly enough to see\nthem going, but as to being in love with them--in that sort of way--\"\n\n\"You are quite right, my boy; quite right. It is not that that a man\nwants in a wife.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Peregrine, with a melancholy cadence in his voice,\nthinking of what it was that he did want. And so they sat sipping\ntheir wine. The turn which the conversation had taken had for the\nmoment nearly put Lady Mason out of the young man's head.\n\n\"You would be very young to marry yet,\" said the baronet.\n\n\"Yes, I should be young; but I don't know that there is any harm in\nthat.\"\n\n\"Quite the contrary, if a young man feels himself to be sufficiently\nsettled. Your mother I know would be very glad that you should marry\nearly;--and so should I, if you married well.\"\n\nWhat on earth could all this mean? It could not be that his\ngrandfather knew that he was in love with Miss Staveley; and had this\nbeen known his grandfather would not have talked of Harriet Tristram.\n\"Oh yes; of course a fellow should marry well. I don't think much of\nmarrying for money.\"\n\n\"Nor do I, Peregrine;--I think very little of it.\"\n\n\"Nor about being of very high birth.\"\n\n\"Well; it would make me unhappy--very unhappy if you were to marry\nbelow your own rank.\"\n\n\"What do you call my own rank?\"\n\n\"I mean any girl whose father is not a gentleman, and whose mother is\nnot a lady; and of whose education among ladies you could not feel\ncertain.\"\n\n\"I could be quite certain about her,\" said Peregrine, very\ninnocently.\n\n\"Her! what her?\"\n\n\"Oh, I forgot that we were talking about nobody.\"\n\n\"You don't mean Harriet Tristram?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not.\"\n\n\"Of whom were you thinking, Peregrine? May I ask--if it be not too\nclose a secret?\" And then again there was a pause, during which\nPeregrine emptied his glass and filled it again. He had no objection\nto talk to his grandfather about Miss Staveley, but he felt ashamed\nof having allowed the matter to escape him in this sort of way. \"I\nwill tell you why I ask, my boy,\" continued the baronet. \"I am going\nto do that which many people will call a very foolish thing.\"\n\n\"You mean about Lady Mason.\"\n\n\"Yes; I mean my own marriage with Lady Mason. We will not talk about\nthat just at present, and I only mention it to explain that before I\ndo so, I shall settle the property permanently. If you were married\nI should at once divide it with you. I should like to keep the old\nhouse myself, till I die--\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir!\"\n\n\"But sooner than give you cause of offence I would give that up.\"\n\n\"I would not consent to live in it unless I did so as your guest.\"\n\n\"Until your marriage I think of settling on you a thousand a\nyear;--but it would add to my happiness if I thought it likely that\nyou would marry soon. Now may I ask of whom were you thinking?\"\n\nPeregrine paused for a second or two before he made any reply, and\nthen he brought it out boldly. \"I was thinking of Madeline Staveley.\"\n\n\"Then, my boy, you were thinking of the prettiest girl and the\nbest-bred lady in the county. Here's her health;\" and he filled for\nhimself a bumper of claret. \"You couldn't have named a woman whom I\nshould be more proud to see you bring home. And your mother's opinion\nof her is the same as mine. I happen to know that;\" and with a look\nof triumph he drank his glass of wine, as though much that was very\njoyful to him had been already settled.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Peregrine mournfully, \"she is a very nice girl; at least\nI think so.\"\n\n\"The man who can win her, Peregrine, may consider himself to be a\nlucky fellow. You were quite right in what you were saying about\nmoney. No man feels more sure of that than I do. But if I am not\nmistaken Miss Staveley will have something of her own. I rather think\nthat Arbuthnot got ten thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, sir,\" said Peregrine; and his voice was by no\nmeans as much elated as that of his grandfather.\n\n\"I think he did; or if he didn't get it all, the remainder is settled\non him. And the judge is not a man to behave better to one child than\nto another.\"\n\n\"I suppose not.\"\n\nAnd then the conversation flagged a little, for the enthusiasm was\nall one side. It was moreover on that side which naturally would have\nbeen the least enthusiastic. Poor Peregrine had only told half his\nsecret as yet, and that not the most important half. To Sir Peregrine\nthe tidings, as far as he had heard them, were very pleasant. He did\nnot say to himself that he would purchase his grandson's assent to\nhis own marriage by giving his consent to his grandson's marriage.\nBut it did seem to him that the two affairs, acting upon each other,\nmight both be made to run smooth. His heir could have made no better\nchoice in selecting the lady of his love. Sir Peregrine had feared\nmuch that some Miss Tristram or the like might have been tendered to\nhim as the future Lady Orme, and he was agreeably surprised to find\nthat a new mistress for The Cleeve had been so well chosen. He would\nbe all kindness to his grandson and win from him, if it might be\npossible, reciprocal courtesy and complaisance. \"Your mother will be\nvery pleased when she hears this,\" he said.\n\n\"I meant to tell my mother,\" said Peregrine, still very dolefully,\n\"but I do not know that there is anything in it to please her. I only\nsaid that I--I admired Miss Staveley.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, if you'll take my advice you'll propose to her at once.\nYou have been staying in the same house with her, and--\"\n\n\"But I have.\"\n\n\"Have what?\"\n\n\"I have proposed to her.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And she has refused me. You know all about it now, and there's no\nsuch great cause for joy.\"\n\n\"Oh, you have proposed to her. Have you spoken to her father or\nmother?\"\n\n\"What was the use when she told me plainly that she did not care for\nme? Of course I should have asked her father. As to Lady Staveley,\nshe and I got on uncommonly well. I'm almost inclined to think that\nshe would not have objected.\"\n\n\"It would be a very nice match for them, and I dare say she would not\nhave objected.\" And then for some ten minutes they sat looking at the\nfire. Peregrine had nothing more to say about it, and the baronet was\nthinking how best he might encourage his grandson.\n\n\"You must try again, you know,\" at last he said.\n\n\"Well; I fear not. I do not think it would be any good. I'm not quite\nsure she does not care for some one else.\"\n\n\"Who is he?\"\n\n\"Oh, a fellow that's there. The man who broke his arm. I don't say\nshe does, you know, and of course you won't mention it.\"\n\nSir Peregrine gave the necessary promises, and then endeavoured to\ngive encouragement to the lover. He would himself see the judge, if\nit were thought expedient, and explain what liberal settlement would\nbe made on the lady in the event of her altering her mind. \"Young\nladies, you know, are very prone to alter their minds on such\nmatters,\" said the old man. In answer to which Peregrine declared\nhis conviction that Madeline Staveley would not alter her mind. But\nthen do not all despondent lovers hold that opinion of their own\nmistresses?\n\nSir Peregrine had been a great gainer by what had occurred, and so\nhe felt it. At any rate all the novelty of the question of his own\nmarriage was over, as between him and Peregrine; and then he had\nacquired a means of being gracious which must almost disarm his\ngrandson of all power of criticism. When he, an old man, was ready to\ndo so much to forward the views of a young man, could it be possible\nthat the young man should oppose his wishes? And Peregrine was aware\nthat his power of opposition was thus lessened.\n\nIn the evening nothing remarkable occurred between them. Each had his\nor her own plans; but these plans could not be furthered by anything\nto be said in a general assembly. Lady Mason had already told to Mrs.\nOrme all that had passed in the drawing-room before dinner, and Sir\nPeregrine had determined that he would consult Mrs. Orme as to that\nmatter regarding Miss Staveley. He did not think much of her refusal.\nYoung ladies always do refuse--at first.\n\nOn the day but one following this there came another visit from Mr.\nFurnival, and he was for a long time closeted with Sir Peregrine.\nMatthew Round had, he said, been with him, and had felt himself\nobliged in the performance of his duty to submit a case to counsel\non behalf of his client Joseph Mason. He had not as yet received the\nwritten opinion of Sir Richard Leatherham, to whom he had applied;\nbut nevertheless, as he wished to give every possible notice, he had\ncalled to say that his firm were of opinion that an action must be\nbrought either for forgery or for perjury.\n\n\"For perjury!\" Mr. Furnival had said.\n\n\"Well; yes. We would wish to be as little harsh as possible. But if\nwe convict her of having sworn falsely when she gave evidence as to\nhaving copied the codicil herself, and having seen it witnessed by\nthe pretended witnesses;--why in that case of course the property\nwould go back.\"\n\n\"I can't give any opinion as to what might be the result in such a\ncase,\" said Mr. Furnival.\n\nMr. Round had gone on to say that he thought it improbable that the\naction could be tried before the summer assizes.\n\n\"The sooner the better as far as we are concerned,\" said Mr.\nFurnival.\n\n\"If you really mean that, I will see that there shall be no\nunnecessary delay.\" Mr. Furnival had declared that he did really mean\nit, and so the interview had ended.\n\nMr. Furnival had really meant it, fully concurring in the opinion\nwhich Mr. Chaffanbrass had expressed on this matter; but nevertheless\nthe increasing urgency of the case had almost made him tremble.\nHe still carried himself with a brave outside before Mat Round,\nprotesting as to the utter absurdity as well as cruelty of the\nwhole proceeding; but his conscience told him that it was not\nabsurd. \"Perjury!\" he said to himself, and then he rang the bell for\nCrabwitz. The upshot of that interview was that Mr. Crabwitz received\na commission to arrange a meeting between that great barrister, the\nmember for the Essex Marshes, and Mr. Solomon Aram.\n\n\"Won't it look rather, rather--rather--; you know what I mean, sir?\"\nCrabwitz had asked.\n\n\"We must fight these people with their own weapons,\" said Mr.\nFurnival;--not exactly with justice, seeing that Messrs. Round and\nCrook were not at all of the same calibre in the profession as Mr.\nSolomon Aram.\n\nMr. Furnival had already at this time seen Mr. Slow, of the firm of\nSlow and Bideawhile, who were Sir Peregrine's solicitors. This he had\ndone chiefly that he might be able to tell Sir Peregrine that he had\nseen him. Mr. Slow had declared that the case was one which his firm\nwould not be prepared to conduct, and he named a firm to which he\nshould recommend his client to apply. But Mr. Furnival, carefully\nconsidering the whole matter, had resolved to take the advice and\nbenefit by the experience of Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\nAnd then he went down once more to The Cleeve. Poor Mr. Furnival! In\nthese days he was dreadfully buffeted about both as regards his outer\nman and his inner conscience by this unfortunate case, giving up to\nit time that would otherwise have turned itself into heaps of gold;\ngiving up domestic conscience--for Mrs. Furnival was still hot in\nher anger against poor Lady Mason; and giving up also much peace of\nmind, for he felt that he was soiling his hands by dirty work. But\nhe thought of the lady's pale sweet face, of her tear-laden eye, of\nher soft beseeching tones, and gentle touch; he thought of these\nthings--as he should not have thought of them;--and he persevered.\n\nOn this occasion he was closeted with Sir Peregrine for a couple of\nhours, and each heard much from the other that surprised him very\nmuch. Sir Peregrine, when he was told that Mr. Solomon Aram from\nBucklersbury, and Mr. Chaffanbrass from the Old Bailey, were to be\nretained for the defence of his future wife, drew himself up and said\nthat he could hardly approve of it. The gentlemen named were no doubt\nvery clever in criminal concerns; he could understand as much as\nthat, though he had not had great opportunity of looking into affairs\nof that sort. But surely, in Lady Mason's case, assistance of such a\ndescription would hardly be needed. Would it not be better to consult\nMessrs. Slow and Bideawhile?\n\nAnd then it turned out that Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile had been\nconsulted; and Mr. Furnival, not altogether successfully, endeavoured\nto throw dust into the baronet's eyes, declaring that in a combat\nwith the devil one must use the devil's weapons. He assured Sir\nPeregrine that he had given the matter his most matured and indeed\nmost painful professional consideration; there were unfortunate\ncircumstances which required peculiar care; it was a matter which\nwould depend entirely on the evidence of one or two persons who might\nbe suborned; and in such a case it would be well to trust to those\nwho knew how to break down and crush a lying witness. In such work as\nthat Slow and Bideawhile would be innocent and ignorant as babes. As\nto breaking down and crushing a witness anxious to speak the truth,\nMr. Furnival at that time said nothing.\n\n\"I will not think that falsehood and fraud can prevail,\" said Sir\nPeregrine proudly.\n\n\"But they do prevail sometimes,\" said Mr. Furnival. And then with\nmuch outer dignity of demeanour, but with some shame-faced tremblings\nof the inner man hidden under the guise of that outer dignity, Sir\nPeregrine informed the lawyer of his great purpose.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Mr. Furnival, throwing himself back into his chair\nwith a start.\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Furnival. I should not have taken the liberty to trouble\nyou with a matter so private in its nature, but for your close\nprofessional intimacy and great friendship with Lady Mason.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Mr. Furnival; and the baronet could understand\nfrom the lawyer's tone that even he did not approve.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nWHY SHOULD HE GO?\n\n\n\"I am well aware, Mr. Staveley, that you are one of those gentlemen\nwho amuse themselves by frequently saying such things to girls. I had\nlearned your character in that respect before I had been in the house\ntwo days.\"\n\n\"Then, Miss Furnival, you learned what was very false. May I ask who\nhas blackened me in this way in your estimation?\" It will be easily\nseen from this that Mr. Augustus Staveley and Miss Furnival were at\nthe present moment alone together in one of the rooms at Noningsby.\n\n\"My informant,\" she replied, \"has been no one special sinner whom you\ncan take by the throat and punish. Indeed, if you must shoot anybody,\nit should be chiefly yourself, and after that your father, and\nmother, and sisters. But you need not talk of being black. Such sins\nare venial now-a-days, and convey nothing deeper than a light shade\nof brown.\"\n\n\"I regard a man who can act in such a way as very base.\"\n\n\"Such a way as what, Mr. Staveley?\"\n\n\"A man who can win a girl's heart for his own amusement.\"\n\n\"I said nothing about the winning of hearts. That is treachery of\nthe worst dye; but I acquit you of any such attempt. When there is a\nquestion of the winning of hearts men look so different.\"\n\n\"I don't know how they look,\" said Augustus, not altogether satisfied\nas to the manner in which he was being treated--\"but such has been my\naudacity,--my too great audacity on the present occasion.\"\n\n\"You are the most audacious of men, for your audacity would carry you\nto the feet of another lady to-morrow without the slightest check.\"\n\n\"And that is the only answer I am to receive from you?\"\n\n\"It is quite answer enough. What would you have me do? Get up and\ndecline the honour of being Mrs. Augustus Staveley with a curtsy?\"\n\n\"No--I would have you do nothing of the kind. I would have you get up\nand accept the honour,--with a kiss.\"\n\n\"So that you might have the kiss, and I might have the--; I was going\nto say disappointment, only that would be untrue. Let me assure you\nthat I am not so demonstrative in my tokens of regard.\"\n\n\"I wonder whether you mean that you are not so honest?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Staveley; I mean nothing of the kind; and you are very\nimpertinent to express such a supposition. What have I done or said\nto make you suppose that I have lost my heart to you?\"\n\n\"As you have mine, it is at any rate human nature in me to hope that\nI might have yours.\"\n\n\"Psha! your heart! You have been making a shuttlecock of it till it\nis doubtful whether you have not banged it to pieces. I know two\nladies who carry in their caps two feathers out of it. It is so\neasy to see when a man is in love. They all go cross-gartered like\nMalvolio;--cross-gartered in their looks and words and doings.\"\n\n\"And there is no touch of all this in me?\"\n\n\"You cross-gartered! You have never got so far yet as a\nlack-a-daisical twist to the corner of your mouth. Did you watch Mr.\nOrme before he went away?\"\n\n\"Why; was he cross-gartered?\"\n\n\"But you men have no eyes; you never see anything. And your idea of\nlove-making is to sit under a tree wishing, wondering whether the\nripe fruit will fall down into your mouth. Ripe fruit does sometimes\nfall, and then it is all well with you. But if it won't, you pass on\nand say that it is sour. As for climbing--\"\n\n\"The fruit generally falls too fast to admit of such exercise,\" said\nStaveley, who did not choose that all the sharp things should be said\non the other side.\n\n\"And that is the result of your very extended experience? The\norchards which have been opened to you have not, I fear, been of the\nfirst quality. Mr. Staveley, my hand will do very well by itself.\nSuch is not the sort of climbing that is required. That is what I\ncall stooping to pick up the fruit that has fallen.\" And as she\nspoke, she moved a little away from him on the sofa.\n\n\"And how is a man to climb?\"\n\n\"Do you really mean that you want a lesson? But if I were to tell\nyou, my words would be thrown away. Men will not labour who have\ngotten all that they require without work. Why strive to deserve any\nwoman, when women are plenty who do not care to be deserved? That\nplan of picking up the fallen apples is so much the easier.\"\n\nThe lesson might perhaps have been given, and Miss Furnival might\nhave imparted to Mr. Staveley her idea of \"excelsior\" in the matter\nof love-making, had not Mr. Staveley's mother come into the room at\nthat moment. Mrs. Staveley was beginning to fear that the results of\nher Christmas hospitality would not be satisfactory. Peregrine Orme,\nwhom she would have been so happy to welcome to the warmest corner of\nher household temple as a son, had been sent away in wretchedness and\ndisappointment. Madeline was moping about the house, hardly making an\neffort to look like herself; attributing, in her mother's ears, all\nher complaint to that unexpected interview with Peregrine Orme, but\nnot so attributing it--as her mother fancied--with correctness. And\nthere was Felix Graham still in the room up stairs, the doctor having\nsaid that he might be moved in a day or two;--that is, such movement\nmight possibly be effected without detriment;--but having said also\nthat another ten days of uninterrupted rest would be very desirable.\nAnd now, in addition to this, her son Augustus was to be found on\nevery wet morning closeted somewhere with Sophia Furnival;--on every\nwet morning, and sometimes on dry mornings also!\n\n[Illustration: Lady Stavely interrupting her Son\nand Sophia Furnival.]\n\nAnd then, on this very day, Lady Staveley had discovered that Felix\nGraham's door in the corridor was habitually left open. She knew\nher child too well, and was too clear and pure in her own mind, to\nsuppose that there was anything wrong in this;--that clandestine\ntalkings were arranged, or anything planned in secret. What she\nfeared was that which really occurred. The door was left open, and as\nMadeline passed Felix would say a word, and then Madeline would pause\nand answer him. Such words as they were might have been spoken before\nall the household, and if so spoken would have been free from danger.\nBut they were not free from danger when spoken in that way, in the\npassage of a half-closed doorway;--all which Lady Staveley understood\nperfectly.\n\n\"Baker,\" she had said, with more of anger in her voice than was usual\nwith her, \"why do you leave that door open?\"\n\n\"I think it sweetens the room, my lady;\" and, indeed, Felix Graham\nsometimes thought so too.\n\n\"Nonsense; every sound in the house must be heard. Keep it shut, if\nyou please.\"\n\n\"Yes, my lady,\" said Mrs. Baker--who also understood perfectly.\n\n\"He is better, my darling,\" said Mrs. Baker to Madeline, the same\nday; \"and, indeed, for that he is well enough as regards eating and\ndrinking. But it would be cruelty to move him yet. I heard what the\ndoctor said.\"\n\n\"Who talks of moving him?\"\n\n\"Well, he talks of it himself; and the doctor said it might be\npossible. But I know what that means.\"\n\n\"What does it mean?\"\n\n\"Why, just this: that if we want to get rid of him, it won't quite be\nthe death of him.\"\n\n\"But who wants to get rid of him?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't. I don't mind my trouble the least in life. He's as\nnice a young gentleman as ever I sat beside the bed of; and he's full\nof spirit--he is.\"\n\nAnd then Madeline appealed to her mother. Surely her mother would not\nlet Mr. Graham be sent out of the house in his present state, merely\nbecause the doctor said it might be possible to move him without\ncausing his instant death! And tears stood in poor Madeline's eyes\nas she thus pleaded the cause of the sick and wounded. This again\ntormented Lady Staveley, who found it necessary to give further\ncaution to Mrs. Baker. \"Baker,\" she said, \"how can you be so foolish\nas to be talking to Miss Madeline about Mr. Graham's arm?\"\n\n\"Who, my lady? I, my lady?\"\n\n\"Yes, you; when you know that the least thing frightens her. Don't\nyou remember how ill it made her when Roger\"--Roger was an old family\ngroom--\"when Roger had that accident?\" Lady Staveley might have saved\nherself the trouble of the reminiscence as to Roger, for Baker knew\nmore about it than that. When Roger's scalp had been laid bare by a\nfall, Miss Madeline had chanced to see it, and had fainted; but Miss\nMadeline was not fainting now. Baker knew all about it, almost better\nthan Lady Staveley herself. It was of very little use talking to\nBaker about Roger the groom. Baker thought that Mr. Felix Graham\nwas a very nice young man, in spite of his \"not being exactly\nhandsomelike about the physgognomy,\" as she remarked to one of the\nyounger maids, who much preferred Peregrine Orme.\n\nComing away from this last interval with Mrs. Baker, Lady Staveley\ninterrupted her son and Sophia Furnival in the back drawing-room, and\nbegan to feel that her solicitude for her children would be almost\ntoo much for her. Why had she asked that nasty girl to her house, and\nwhy would not the nasty girl go away? As for her going away, there\nwas no present hope; for it had been arranged that she should stay\nfor another fortnight. Why could not the Fates have been kind, and\nhave allowed Felix Graham and Miss Furnival to fall in love with each\nother? \"I can never make a daughter of her if he does marry her,\"\nLady Staveley said to herself, as she looked at them.\n\nAugustus looked as though he were detected, and stammered out some\nquestion about his mother and the carriage; but Miss Furnival did not\nfor a moment lose her easy presence of mind. \"Lady Staveley,\" said\nshe, \"why does not your son go and hunt, or shoot, or fish, instead\nof staying in the house all day? It seems to me that his time is so\nheavy on his hands that he will almost have to hang himself.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I can't tell,\" said Lady Staveley, who was not so perfect\nan actor as her guest.\n\n\"I do think gentlemen in the house in the morning always look so\nunfortunate. You have been endeavouring to make yourself agreeable,\nbut you know you've been yawning.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose then that men never sit still in the morning?\" said\nAugustus.\n\n\"Oh, in their chambers, yes; or on the bench, and perhaps also behind\ncounters; but they very seldom do so in a drawing-room. You have been\nfidgeting about with the poker till you have destroyed the look of\nthe fireplace.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll go and fidget up stairs with Graham,\" said he; and so he\nleft the room.\n\n\"Nasty, sly girl,\" said Lady Staveley to herself as she took up her\nwork and sat herself down in her own chair.\n\nAugustus did go up to his friend and found him reading letters. There\nwas no one else in the room, and the door when Augustus reached it\nwas properly closed. \"I think I shall be off to-morrow, old boy,\"\nsaid Felix.\n\n\"Then I think you'll do no such thing,\" said Augustus. \"What's in the\nwind now?\"\n\n\"The doctor said this morning that I could be moved without danger.\"\n\n\"He said that it might possibly be done in two or three days--that\nwas all. What on earth makes you so impatient? You've nothing to do.\nNobody else wants to see you; and nobody here wants to get rid of\nyou.\"\n\n\"You're wrong in all your three statements.\"\n\n\"The deuce I am! Who wants to get rid of you?\"\n\n\"That shall come last. I have something to do, and somebody else\ndoes want to see me. I've got a letter from Mary here, and another\nfrom Mrs. Thomas;\" and he held up to view two letters which he had\nreceived, and which had, in truth, startled him.\n\n\"Mary's duenna;--the artist who is supposed to be moulding the wife.\"\n\n\"Yes; Mary's duenna, or Mary's artist, whichever you please.\"\n\n\"And which of them wants to see you? It's just like a woman, to\nrequire a man's attendance exactly when he is unable to move.\"\n\nThen Felix, though he did not give up the letters to be read,\ndescribed to a certain extent their contents. \"I don't know what\non earth has happened,\" he said. \"Mary is praying to be forgiven,\nand saying that it is not her fault; and Mrs. Thomas is full\nof apologies, declaring that her conscience forces her to tell\neverything; and yet, between them both, I do not know what has\nhappened.\"\n\n\"Miss Snow has probably lost the key of the workbox you gave her.\"\n\n\"I have not given her a workbox.\"\n\n\"Then the writing-desk. That's what a man has to endure when he will\nmake himself head schoolmaster to a young lady. And so you're going\nto look after your charge with your limbs still in bandages?\"\n\n\"Just so;\" and then he took up the two letters and read them again,\nwhile Staveley still sat on the foot of the bed. \"I wish I knew what\nto think about it,\" said Felix.\n\n\"About what?\" said the other. And then there was another pause, and\nanother reading of a portion of the letters.\n\n\"There seems something--something almost frightful to me,\" said Felix\ngravely, \"in the idea of marrying a girl in a few months' time, who\nnow, at so late a period of our engagement, writes to me in that sort\nof cold, formal way.\"\n\n\"It's the proper moulded-wife style, you may depend,\" said Augustus.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Staveley, if you can talk to me seriously for\nfive minutes, I shall be obliged to you. If that is impossible to\nyou, say so, and I will drop the matter.\"\n\n\"Well, go on; I am serious enough in what I intend to express, even\nthough I may not be so in my words.\"\n\n\"I'm beginning to have my doubts about this dear girl.\"\n\n\"I've had my doubts for some time.\"\n\n\"Not, mark you, with regard to myself. The question is not now\nwhether I can love her sufficiently for my own happiness. On that\nside I have no longer the right to a doubt.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't marry her if you did not love her.\"\n\n\"We need not discuss that. But what if she does not love me? What if\nshe would think it a release to be freed from this engagement? How am\nI to find that out?\"\n\nAugustus sat for a while silent, for he did feel that the matter was\nserious. The case as he looked at it stood thus:--His friend Graham\nhad made a very foolish bargain, from which he would probably be glad\nto escape, though he could not now bring himself to say as much. But\nthis bargain, bad for him, would probably be very good for the young\nlady. The young lady, having no shilling of her own, and no merits\nof birth or early breeding to assist her outlook in the world, might\nprobably regard her ready-made engagement to a clever, kind-hearted,\nhigh-spirited man, as an advantage not readily to be abandoned.\nStaveley, as a sincere friend, was very anxious that the match should\nbe broken off; but he could not bring himself to tell Graham that\nhe thought that the young lady would so wish. According to his idea\nthe young lady must undergo a certain amount of disappointment,\nand receive a certain amount of compensation. Graham had been very\nfoolish, and must pay for his folly. But in preparing to do so, it\nwould be better that he should see and acknowledge the whole truth of\nthe matter.\n\n\"Are you sure that you have found out your own feelings?\" Staveley\nsaid at last; and his tone was then serious enough even for his\nfriend.\n\n\"It hardly matters whether I have or have not,\" said Felix.\n\n\"It matters above all things;--above all things, because as to them\nyou may come to something like certainty. Of the inside of her heart\nyou cannot know so much. The fact I take it is this--that you would\nwish to escape from this bondage.\"\n\n\"No; not unless I thought she regarded it as bondage also. It may be\nthat she does. As for myself, I believe that at the present moment\nsuch a marriage would be for me the safest step that I could take.\"\n\n\"Safe as against what danger?\"\n\n\"All dangers. How, if I should learn to love another woman,--some one\nutterly out of my reach,--while I am still betrothed to her?\"\n\n\"I rarely flatter you, Graham, and don't mean to do it now; but no\ngirl ought to be out of your reach. You have talent, position, birth,\nand gifts of nature, which should make you equal to any lady. As for\nmoney, the less you have the more you should look to get. But if\nyou would cease to be mad, two years would give you command of an\nincome.\"\n\n\"But I shall never cease to be mad.\"\n\n\"Who is it that cannot be serious, now?\"\n\n\"Well, I will be serious--serious enough. I can afford to be so, as\nI have received my medical passport for to-morrow. No girl, you say,\nought to be out of my reach. If the girl were one Miss Staveley,\nshould she be regarded as out of my reach?\"\n\n\"A man doesn't talk about his own sister,\" said Staveley, having got\nup from the bed and walked to the window, \"and I know you don't mean\nanything.\"\n\n\"But, by heavens! I do mean a great deal.\"\n\n\"What is it you mean, then?\"\n\n\"I mean this--What would you say if you learned that I was a suitor\nfor her hand?\"\n\nStaveley had been right in saying that a man does not talk about\nhis own sister. When he had declared, with so much affectionate\nadmiration for his friend's prowess, that he might aspire to the\nhand of any lady, that one retiring, modest-browed girl had not been\nthought of by him. A man in talking to another man about women is\nalways supposed to consider those belonging to himself as exempt from\nthe incidents of the conversation. The dearest friends do not talk\nto each other about their sisters when they have once left school;\nand a man in such a position as that now taken by Graham has to make\nfight for his ground as closely as though there had been no former\nintimacies. My friend Smith in such a matter as that, though I have\nbeen hail fellow with him for the last ten years, has very little\nadvantage over Jones, who was introduced to the house for the first\ntime last week. And therefore Staveley felt himself almost injured\nwhen Felix Graham spoke to him about Madeline.\n\n\"What would I say? Well--that is a question one does not understand,\nunless--unless you really meant to state it as a fact that it was\nyour intention to propose to her.\"\n\n\"But I mean rather to state it as a fact that it is not my intention\nto propose to her.\"\n\n\"Then we had better not speak of her.\"\n\n\"Listen to me a moment. In order that I may not do so, it will be\nbetter for me--better for us all, that I should leave the house.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say--?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do mean to say! I mean to say all that your mind is now\nsuggesting to you. I quite understand your feelings when you declare\nthat a man does not like to talk of his own sister, and therefore we\nwill talk of your sister no more. Old fellow, don't look at me as\nthough you meant to drop me.\"\n\nAugustus came back to the bedside, and again seating himself, put his\nhand almost caressingly over his friend's shoulder. \"I did not think\nof this,\" he said.\n\n\"No; one never does think of it,\" Graham replied.\n\n\"And she?\"\n\n\"She knows no more of it than that bed-post,\" said Graham. \"The\ninjury, such as there is, is all on one side. But I'll tell you who\nsuspects it.\"\n\n\"Baker?\"\n\n\"Your mother. I am much mistaken if you will not find that she, with\nall her hospitality, would prefer that I should recover my strength\nelsewhere.\"\n\n\"But you have done nothing to betray yourself.\"\n\n\"A mother's ears are very sharp. I know that it is so. I cannot\nexplain to you how. Do you tell her that I think of getting up to\nLondon to-morrow, and see how she will take it. And, Staveley, do not\nfor a moment suppose that I am reproaching her. She is quite right.\nI believe that I have in no way committed myself--that I have said\nno word to your sister with which Lady Staveley has a right to feel\nherself aggrieved; but if she has had the wit to read the thoughts of\nmy bosom, she is quite right to wish that I were out of the house.\"\n\nPoor Lady Staveley had been possessed of no such wit at all. The\nsphynx which she had read had been one much more in her own line. She\nhad simply read the thoughts in her daughter's bosom--or rather, the\nfeelings in her daughter's heart.\n\nAugustus Staveley hardly knew what he ought to say. He was not\nprepared to tell his friend that he was the very brother-in-law for\nwhose connection he would be desirous. Such a marriage for Madeline,\neven should Madeline desire it, would not be advantageous. When\nAugustus told Graham that he had gifts of nature which made him equal\nto any lady, he did not include his own sister. And yet the idea of\nacquiescing in his friend's sudden departure was very painful to him.\n\"There can be no reason why you should not stay up here, you know,\"\nat last he said;--and in so saying he pronounced an absolute verdict\nagainst poor Felix.\n\nOn few matters of moment to a man's own heart can he speak out\nplainly the whole truth that is in him. Graham had intended so to\ndo, but had deceived himself. He had not absolutely hoped that his\nfriend would say, \"Come among us, and be one of us; take her, and\nbe my brother.\" But yet there came upon his heart a black load of\ndisappointment, in that the words which were said were the exact\nopposite of these. Graham had spoken of himself as unfit to match\nwith Madeline Staveley, and Madeline Staveley's brother had taken him\nat his word. The question which Augustus asked himself was this--Was\nit, or was it not practicable that Graham should remain there without\ndanger of intercourse with his sister? To Felix the question came in\na very different shape. After having spoken as he had spoken--might\nhe be allowed to remain there, enjoying such intercourse, or might he\nnot? That was the question to which he had unconsciously demanded an\nanswer;--and unconsciously he had still hoped that the question might\nbe answered in his favour. He had so hoped, although he was burdened\nwith Mary Snow, and although he had spoken of his engagement with\nthat lady in so rigid a spirit of self-martyrdom. But the question\nhad been answered against him. The offer of a further asylum in the\nseclusion of that bedroom had been made to him by his friend with a\nsort of proviso that it would not be well that he should go further\nthan the bedroom, and his inner feelings at once grated against each\nother, making him wretched and almost angry.\n\n\"Thank you, no; I understand how kind you are, but I will not do\nthat. I will write up to-night, and shall certainly start to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My dear fellow--\"\n\n\"I should get into a fever, if I were to remain in this house after\nwhat I have told you. I could not endure to see you, or your mother,\nor Baker, or Marian, or any one else. Don't talk about it. Indeed,\nyou ought to feel that it is not possible. I have made a confounded\nass of myself, and the sooner I get away the better. I say--perhaps\nyou would not be angry if I was to ask you to let me sleep for an\nhour or so now. After that I'll get up and write my letters.\"\n\nHe was very sore. He knew that he was sick at heart, and ill at ease,\nand cross with his friend; and knew also that he was unreasonable\nin being so. Staveley's words and manner had been full of kindness.\nGraham was aware of this, and was therefore the more irritated with\nhimself. But this did not prevent his being angry and cross with his\nfriend.\n\n\"Graham,\" said the other, \"I see clearly enough that I have annoyed\nyou.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. A man falls into the mud, and then calls to\nanother man to come and see him. The man in the mud of course is not\ncomfortable.\"\n\n\"But you have called to me, and I have not been able to help you.\"\n\n\"I did not suppose you would, so there has been no disappointment.\nIndeed, there was no possibility for help. I shall follow out the\nline of life which I have long since chalked out for myself, and\nI do not expect that I shall be more wretched than other poor\ndevils around me. As far as my idea goes, it all makes very little\ndifference. Now leave me; there's a good fellow.\"\n\n\"Dear old fellow, I would give my right hand if it would make you\nhappy!\"\n\n\"But it won't. Your right hand will make somebody else happy, I\nhope.\"\n\n\"I'll come up to you again before dinner.\"\n\n\"Very well. And, Staveley, what we have now said cannot be forgotten\nbetween us; but when we next meet, and ever after, let it be as\nthough it were forgotten.\" Then he settled himself down on the bed,\nand Augustus left the room.\n\nIt will not be supposed that Graham did go to sleep, or that he had\nany thought of doing so. When he was alone those words of his friend\nrang over and over again in his ears, \"No girl ought to be out of\nyour reach.\" Why should Madeline Staveley be out of his reach, simply\nbecause she was his friend's sister? He had been made welcome to that\nhouse, and therefore he was bound to do nothing unhandsome by the\nfamily. But then he was bound by other laws, equally clear, to do\nnothing unhandsome by any other family--or by any other lady. If\nthere was anything in Staveley's words, they applied as strongly to\nStaveley's sister as to any other girl. And why should not he, a\nlawyer, marry a lawyer's daughter? Sophia Furnival, with her hatful\nof money, would not be considered too high for him; and in what\nrespect was Madeline Staveley above Sophia Furnival? That the one\nwas immeasurably above the other in all those respects which in his\nestimation tended towards female perfection, he knew to be true\nenough; but the fruit which he had been forbidden to gather hung no\nhigher on the social tree than that other fruit which he had been\nspecially invited to pluck and garner.\n\nAnd then Graham was not a man to think any fruit too high for him.\nHe had no overweening idea of his own deserts, either socially or\nprofessionally, nor had he taught himself to expect great things from\nhis own genius; but he had that audacity of spirit which bids a man\nhope to compass that which he wishes to compass,--that audacity which\nis both the father and mother of success,--that audacity which seldom\nexists without the inner capability on which it ought to rest.\n\nBut then there was Mary Snow! Augustus Staveley thought but little of\nMary Snow. According to his theory of his friend's future life, Mary\nSnow might be laid aside without much difficulty. If this were so,\nwhy should not Madeline be within his reach? But then was it so? Had\nhe not betrothed himself to Mary Snow in the presence of the girl's\nfather, with every solemnity and assurance, in a manner fixed beyond\nthat of all other betrothals? Alas, yes; and for this reason it was\nright that he should hurry away from Noningsby.\n\nThen he thought of Mary's letter, and of Mrs. Thomas's letter. What\nwas it that had been done? Mary had written as though she had been\ncharged with some childish offence; but Mrs. Thomas talked solemnly\nof acquitting her own conscience. What could have happened that had\ntouched Mrs. Thomas in the conscience?\n\nBut his thoughts soon ran away from the little house at Peckham,\nand settled themselves again at Noningsby. Should he hear more of\nMadeline's footsteps?--and if not, why should they have been banished\nfrom the corridor? Should he hear her voice again at the door,--and\nif not, why should it have been hushed? There is a silence which may\nbe more eloquent than the sounds which it follows. Had no one in that\nhouse guessed the feelings in his bosom, she would have walked along\nthe corridor as usual, and spoken a word with her sweet voice in\nanswer to his word. He felt sure that this would be so no more; but\nwho had stopped it, and why should such sounds be no more heard?\n\nAt last he did go to sleep, not in pursuance of any plan formed for\ndoing so; for had he been asked he would have said that sleep was\nimpossible for him. But he did go to sleep, and when he awoke it was\ndark. He had intended to have got up and dressed on that afternoon,\nor to have gone through such ceremony of dressing as was possible for\nhim,--in preparation of his next day's exercise; and now he rose up\nin his bed with a start, angry with himself in having allowed the\ntime to pass by him.\n\n\"Lord love you, Mr. Graham, why how you have slept!\" said Mrs. Baker.\n\"If I haven't just sent your dinner down again to keep hot. Such a\nbeautiful pheasant, and the bread sauce'll be lumpy now, for all the\nworld like pap.\"\n\n\"Never mind the bread sauce, Mrs. Baker;--the pheasant's the thing.\"\n\n\"And her ladyship's been here, Mr. Graham, only she wouldn't have you\nwoke. She won't hear of your being moved to-morrow, nor yet won't the\njudge. There was a rumpus down stairs when Mr. Augustus as much as\nmentioned it. I know one who--\"\n\n\"You know one who--you were saying?\"\n\n\"Never mind.--It ain't one more than another, but it's all. You ain't\nto leave this to-morrow, so you may just give it over. And indeed\nyour things is all at the wash, so you can't;--and now I'll go down\nfor the pheasant.\"\n\nFelix still declared very positively that he should go, but his\ndoing so did not shake Mrs. Baker. The letter-bag he knew did not\nleave till eight, and as yet it was not much past five. He would see\nStaveley again after his dinner, and then he would write.\n\nWhen Augustus left the room in the middle of the day he encountered\nMadeline wandering about the house. In these days she did wander\nabout the house, as though there were something always to be done in\nsome place apart from that in which she then was. And yet the things\nwhich she did were but few. She neither worked nor read, and as for\nhousehold duties, her share in them was confined almost entirely to\nthe morning and evening teapot.\n\n\"It isn't true that he's to go to-morrow morning, Augustus, is it?\"\nsaid she.\n\n\"Who, Graham? Well; he says that he will. He is very anxious to get\nto London; and no doubt he finds it stupid enough lying there and\ndoing nothing.\"\n\n\"But he can do as much there as he can lying by himself in his own\nchambers, where I don't suppose he would have anybody to look after\nhim. He thinks he's a trouble and all that, and therefore he wants to\ngo. But you know mamma doesn't mind about trouble of that kind; and\nwhat should we think of it afterwards if anything bad was to happen\nto your friend because we allowed him to leave the house before\nhe was in a fit state to be moved? Of course Mr. Pottinger says\nso--\" Mr. Pottinger was the doctor. \"Of course Mr. Pottinger says\nso, because he thinks he has been so long here, and he doesn't\nunderstand.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Pottinger would like to keep a patient.\"\n\n\"Oh no; he's not at all that sort of man. He'd think of mamma,--the\ntrouble I mean of having a stranger in the house. But you know mamma\nwould think nothing of that, especially for such an intimate friend\nof yours.\"\n\nAugustus turned slightly round so as to look more fully into his\nsister's face, and he saw that a tear was gathered in the corner of\nher eye. She perceived his glance and partly shrank under it, but she\nsoon recovered herself and answered it. \"I know what you mean,\" she\nsaid, \"and if you choose to think so, I can't help it. But it is\nhorrible--horrible--\" and then she stopped herself, finding that a\nlittle sob would become audible if she trusted herself to further\nwords.\n\n\"You know what I mean, Mad?\" he said, putting his arm affectionately\nround her waist. \"And what is it that I mean? Come; you and I never\nhave any secrets;--you always say so when you want to get at mine.\nTell me what it is that I mean.\"\n\n\"I haven't got any secret.\"\n\n\"But what did I mean?\"\n\n\"You looked at me, because I don't want you to let them send Mr.\nGraham away. If it was old Mr. Furnival I shouldn't like them to turn\nhim out of this house when he was in such a state as that.\"\n\n\"Poor Mr. Furnival; no; I think he would bear it worse than Felix.\"\n\n\"Then why should he go? And why--should you look at me in that way?\"\n\n\"Did I look at you, Mad? Well, I believe I did. We are to have no\nsecrets; are we?\"\n\n\"No,\" said she. But she did not say it in the same eager voice with\nwhich hitherto she had declared that they would always tell each\nother everything.\n\n\"Felix Graham is my friend,\" said he, \"my special friend; and I hope\nyou will always like my friends. But--\"\n\n\"Well?\" she said.\n\n\"You know what I mean, Mad\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n\"That is all, dearest.\" And then she knew that he also had cautioned\nher not to fall in love with Felix Graham, and she felt angry with\nhim for the caution. \"Why--why--why--?\" But she hardly knew as yet\nhow to frame the question which she desired to ask herself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nI CALL IT AWFUL.\n\n\n\"Oh indeed!\" Those had been the words with which Mr. Furnival had\nreceived the announcement made by Sir Peregrine as to his proposed\nnuptials. And as he uttered them the lawyer drew himself up stiffly\nin his chair, looking much more like a lawyer and much less like an\nold family friend than he had done the moment before.\n\nWhereupon Sir Peregrine drew himself up also. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I\nshould be intrusive if I were to trouble you with my motives, and\ntherefore I need only say further as regards the lady, that I trust\nthat my support, standing as I shall do in the position of her\nhusband, will be more serviceable to her than it could otherwise have\nbeen in this trial which she will, I presume, be forced to undergo.\"\n\n\"No doubt; no doubt,\" said Mr. Furnival; and then the interview\nhad ended. The lawyer had been anxious to see his client, and had\nintended to ask permission to do so; but he had felt on hearing Sir\nPeregrine's tidings that it would be useless now to make any attempt\nto see her alone, and that he could speak to her with no freedom\nin Sir Peregrine's presence. So he left The Cleeve, having merely\nintimated to the baronet the fact of his having engaged the services\nof Mr. Chaffanbrass and Mr. Solomon Aram. \"You will not see Lady\nMason?\" Sir Peregrine had asked. \"Thank you; I do not know that\nI need trouble her,\" Mr. Furnival had answered. \"You of course\nwill explain to her how the case at present stands. I fear she\nmust reconcile herself to the fact of a trial. You are aware, Sir\nPeregrine, that the offence imputed is one for which bail will be\ntaken. I should propose yourself and her son. Of course I should be\nhappy to lend my own name, but as I shall be on the trial, perhaps it\nmay be as well that this should be avoided.\"\n\nBail will be taken! These words were dreadful in the ears of the\nexpectant bridegroom. Had it come to this; that there was a question\nwhether or no she should be locked up in a prison, like a felon? But\nnevertheless his heart did not misgive him. Seeing how terribly she\nwas injured by others, he felt himself bound by the stronger law to\ncling to her himself. Such was the special chivalry of the man.\n\nMr. Furnival on his return to London thought almost more of Sir\nPeregrine than he did either of Lady Mason or of himself. Was it not\na pity? Was it not a thousand pities that that aged noble gentleman\nshould be sacrificed? He had felt angry with Sir Peregrine when the\ntidings were first communicated to him; but now, as he journeyed up\nto London this feeling of anger was transferred to his own client.\nThis must be her doing, and such doing on her part, while she was in\nher present circumstances, was very wicked. And then he remembered\nher guilt,--her probable guilt, and his brow became very black. Her\nsupposed guilt had not been horrible to him while he had regarded it\nas affecting herself alone, and in point of property affecting Joseph\nMason and her son Lucius. He could look forward, sometimes almost\ntriumphantly, to the idea of washing her--so far as this world's\nwashing goes--from that guilt, and setting her up again clear before\nthe world, even though in doing so he should lend a hand in robbing\nJoseph Mason of his estate. But this dragging down of another--and\nsuch another--head into the vortex of ruin and misery was horrible to\nhim. He was not straitlaced, or mealy-mouthed, or overburthened with\nscruples. In the way of his profession he could do many a thing at\nwhich--I express a single opinion with much anxious deference--at\nwhich an honest man might be scandalized if it came beneath his\njudgment unprofessionally. But this he could not stand. Something\nmust be done in the matter. The marriage must be stayed till after\nthe trial,--or else he must himself retire from the defence and\nexplain both to Lady Mason and to Sir Peregrine why he did so.\n\nAnd then he thought of the woman herself, and his spirit within him\nbecame very bitter. Had any one told him that he was jealous of the\npreference shown by his client to Sir Peregrine, he would have fumed\nwith anger, and thought that he was fuming justly. But such was in\ntruth the case. Though he believed her to have been guilty of this\nthing, though he believed her to be now guilty of the worse offence\nof dragging the baronet to his ruin, still he was jealous of her\nregard. Had she been content to lean upon him, to trust to him as her\ngreat and only necessary friend, he could have forgiven all else, and\nplaced at her service the full force of his professional power,--even\nthough by doing so he might have lowered himself in men's minds. And\nwhat reward did he expect? None. He had formed no idea that the woman\nwould become his mistress. All that was as obscure before his mind's\neye, as though she had been nineteen and he five-and-twenty.\n\nHe was to dine at home on this day, that being the first occasion of\nhis doing so for--as Mrs. Furnival declared--the last six months. In\ntruth, however, the interval had been long, though not so long as\nthat. He had a hope that having announced his intention, he might\nfind the coast clear and hear Martha Biggs spoken of as a dear\none lately gone. But when he arrived at home Martha Biggs was\nstill there. Under circumstances as they now existed Mrs. Furnival\nhad determined to keep Martha Biggs by her, unless any special\nedict for her banishment should come forth. Then, in case of such\nspecial edict, Martha Biggs should go, and thence should arise the\nnew casus belli. Mrs. Furnival had made up her mind that war was\nexpedient,--nay, absolutely necessary. She had an idea, formed no\ndoubt from the reading of history, that some allies require a smart\nbrush now and again to blow away the clouds of distrust which become\nengendered by time between them; and that they may become better\nallies than ever afterwards. If the appropriate time for such a brush\nmight ever come, it had come now. All the world,--so she said to\nherself,--was talking of Mr. Furnival and Lady Mason. All the world\nknew of her injuries.\n\nMartha Biggs was second cousin to Mr. Crook's brother's wife--I speak\nof that Mr. Crook who had been professionally known for the last\nthirty years as the partner of Mr. Round. It had been whispered in\nthe office in Bedford Row--such whisper I fear originating with old\nRound--that Mr. Furnival admired his fair client. Hence light had\nfallen upon the eyes of Martha Biggs, and the secret of her friend\nwas known to her. Need I trace the course of the tale with closer\naccuracy?\n\n\"Oh, Kitty,\" she had said to her friend with tears that evening--\"I\ncannot bear to keep it to myself any more! I cannot when I see you\nsuffering so. It's awful.\"\n\n\"Cannot bear to keep what, Martha?\"\n\n\"Oh, I know. Indeed all the town knows it now.\"\n\n\"Knows what? You know how I hate that kind of thing. If you have\nanything to say, speak out.\"\n\nThis was not kind to such a faithful friend as Martha Biggs; but\nMartha knew what sacrifices friendship such as hers demanded, and she\ndid not resent it.\n\n\"Well then;--if I am to speak out, it's--Lady Mason. And I do say\nthat it's shameful, quite shameful;--and awful; I call it awful.\"\n\nMrs. Furnival had not said much at the time to encourage the fidelity\nof her friend, but she was thus justified in declaring to herself\nthat her husband's goings on had become the talk of all the\nworld;--and his goings on especially in that quarter in which she\nhad long regarded them with so much dismay. She was not therefore\nprepared to welcome him on this occasion of his coming home to dinner\nby such tokens of friendly feeling as the dismissal of her friend to\nRed Lion Square. When the moment for absolute war should come Martha\nBiggs should be made to depart.\n\nMr. Furnival when he arrived at his own house was in a thoughtful\nmood, and disposed for quiet and domestic meditation. Had Miss Biggs\nnot been there he could have found it in his heart to tell everything\nabout Lady Mason to his wife, asking her counsel as to what he should\ndo with reference to that marriage. Could he have done so, all would\nhave been well; but this was not possible while that red-faced lump\nof a woman from Red Lion Square sat in his drawing-room, making\neverything uncomfortable.\n\nThe three sat down to dinner together, and very little was said\nbetween them. Mr. Furnival did try to be civil to his wife, but wives\nsometimes have a mode of declining such civilities without committing\nthemselves to overt acts of war. To Miss Biggs Mr. Furnival could not\nbring himself to say anything civil, seeing that he hated her; but\nsuch words as he did speak to her she received with grim griffin-like\nausterity, as though she were ever meditating on the awfulness of his\nconduct. And so in truth she was. Why his conduct was more awful in\nher estimation since she had heard Lady Mason's name mentioned, than\nwhen her mind had been simply filled with general ideas of vague\nconjugal infidelity, I cannot say; but such was the case. \"I call it\nawful,\" were the first words she again spoke when she found herself\nonce more alone with Mrs. Furnival in the drawing-room. And then\nshe sat down over the fire, thinking neither of her novel nor her\nknitting, with her mind deliciously filled with the anticipation of\ncoming catastrophes.\n\n\"If I sit up after half-past ten would you mind going to bed?\" said\nMrs. Furnival, when they had been in the drawing-room about ten\nminutes.\n\n\"Oh no, not in the least,\" said Miss Biggs. \"I'll be sure to go.\"\nBut she thought it very unkind, and she felt as a child does who is\ndeceived in a matter of being taken to the play. If no one goes the\nchild can bear it. But to see others go, and to be left behind, is\ntoo much for the feelings of any child,--or of Martha Biggs.\n\nMr. Furnival had no inclination for sitting alone over his wine on\nthis occasion. Had it been possible for him he would have preferred\nto have gone quickly up stairs, and to have taken his cup of coffee\nfrom his wife's hand with some appreciation of domestic comfort. But\nthere could be no such comfort to him while Martha Biggs was there,\nso he sat down stairs, sipping his port according to his custom, and\nlooking into the fire for a solution of his difficulties about Lady\nMason. He began to wish that he had never seen Lady Mason, and to\nreflect that the intimate friendship of pretty women often brings\nwith it much trouble. He was resolved on one thing. He would not go\ndown into court and fight that battle for Lady Orme. Were he to do so\nthe matter would have taken quite a different phase,--one that he had\nnot at all anticipated. In case that his present client should then\nhave become Lady Orme, Mr. Chaffanbrass and Mr. Solomon Aram might\ncarry on the battle between them, with such assistance as they might\nbe able to get from Messrs. Slow and Bideawhile. He became angry as\nhe drank his port, and in his anger he swore that it should be so.\nAnd then as his anger became hot at the close of his libations, he\nremembered that Martha Biggs was up stairs, and became more angry\nstill. And thus when he did go into the drawing-room at some time in\nthe evening not much before ten, he was not in a frame of mind likely\nto bring about domestic comfort.\n\nHe walked across the drawing-room, sat down in an arm-chair by the\ntable, and took up the last number of a review, without speaking to\neither of them. Whereupon Mrs. Furnival began to ply her needle which\nhad been lying idly enough upon her work, and Martha Biggs fixed\nher eyes intently upon her book. So they sat twenty minutes without\na word being spoken, and then Mrs. Furnival inquired of her lord\nwhether he chose to have tea.\n\n\"Of course I shall,--when you have it,\" said he.\n\n\"Don't mind us,\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"Pray don't mind me,\" said Martha Biggs. \"Don't let me be in the\nway.\"\n\n\"No, I won't,\" said Mr. Furnival. Whereupon Miss Biggs again jumped\nup in her chair as though she had been electrified. It may be\nremembered that on a former occasion Mr. Furnival had sworn at\nher--or at least in her presence.\n\n\"You need not be rude to a lady in your own house, because she is my\nfriend,\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"Bother,\" said Mr. Furnival. \"And now if we are going to have any\ntea, let us have it.\"\n\n\"I don't think I'll mind about tea to-night, Mrs. Furnival,\" said\nMiss Biggs, having received a notice from her friend's eye that it\nmight be well for her to depart. \"My head aches dreadful, and I shall\nbe better in bed. Good-night, Mrs. Furnival.\" And then she took her\ncandle and went away.\n\nFor the next five minutes there was not a word said. No tea had been\nordered, although it had been mentioned. Mrs. Furnival had forgotten\nit among the hot thoughts that were running through her mind, and Mr.\nFurnival was indifferent upon the subject. He knew that something was\ncoming, and he resolved that he would have the upper hand let that\nsomething be what it might. He was being ill used,--so he said to\nhimself--and would not put up with it.\n\nAt last the battle began. He was not looking, but he heard her first\nmovement as she prepared herself. \"Tom!\" she said, and then the voice\nof the war goddess was again silent. He did not choose to answer her\nat the instant, and then the war goddess rose from her seat and again\nspoke. \"Tom!\" she said, standing over him and looking at him.\n\n\"What is it you mean?\" said he, allowing his eyes to rise to her face\nover the top of his book.\n\n\"Tom!\" she said for the third time.\n\n\"I'll have no nonsense, Kitty,\" said he. \"If you have anything to\nsay, say it.\"\n\nEven then she had intended to be affectionate,--had so intended at\nthe first commencement of her address. She had no wish to be a war\ngoddess. But he had assisted her attempt at love by no gentle word,\nby no gentle look, by no gentle motion. \"I have this to say,\" she\nreplied; \"you are disgracing both yourself and me, and I will not\nremain in this house to be a witness to it.\"\n\n\"Then you may go out of the house.\" These words, be it remembered,\nwere uttered not by the man himself, but by the spirit of port wine\nwithin the man.\n\n\"Tom, do you say that;--after all?\"\n\n\"By heavens I do say it! I'll not be told in my own drawing-room,\neven by you, that I am disgracing myself.\"\n\n\"Then why do you go after that woman down to Hamworth? All the world\nis talking of you. At your age too! You ought to be ashamed of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I can't stand this,\" said he, getting up and throwing the book from\nhim right across the drawing-room floor; \"and, by heavens! I won't\nstand it.\"\n\n\"Then why do you do it, sir?\"\n\n\"Kitty, I believe the devil must have entered into you to drive you\nmad.\"\n\n\"Oh, oh, oh! very well, sir. The devil in the shape of drink\nand lust has entered into you. But you may understand this;\nI--will--not--consent to live with you while such deeds as these are\nbeing done.\" And then without waiting for another word, she stormed\nout of the room.\n\n\n\n\nVOLUME II.\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nHOW CAN I SAVE HIM?\n\n\n\"I will not consent to live with you while such deeds as these are\nbeing done.\" Such were the last words which Mrs. Furnival spoke as\nshe walked out of her own drawing-room, leaving her husband still\nseated in his arm-chair.\n\nWhat was he to do? Those who would hang by the letter of the law in\nsuch matters may say that he should have rung the bell, sent for his\nwife, explained to her that obedience was a necessary duty on her\npart, and have finished by making her understand that she must and\nwould continue to live wherever he chose that she should live. There\nbe those who say that if a man be anything of a man, he can always\ninsure obedience in his own household. He has the power of the purse\nand the power of the law; and if, having these, he goes to the wall,\nit must be because he is a poor creature. Those who so say have\nprobably never tried the position.\n\nMr. Furnival did not wish to send for his wife, because by doing so\nhe would have laid bare his sore before his servants. He could not\nfollow her, because he knew that he should not find her alone in her\nroom. Nor did he wish for any further parley, because he knew that\nshe would speak loud, and probably sob--nay, very possibly proceed to\na fainting fit. And, moreover, he much doubted whether he would have\nthe power to keep her in the house if it should be her pleasure to\nleave it. And then what should he do? The doing of something in such\na catastrophe was, he thought, indispensable.\n\nWas ever a man so ill treated? Was ever jealousy so groundless? Here\nwas a woman, with whom he was on the point of quarrelling, who was\nengaged to be married to another man, whom for months past he had\nonly seen as a client; and on her account he was to be told by his\nwife that she would not consent to live with him! Yes; it was quite\nindispensable that he should do something.\n\nAt last he went to bed, and slept upon it; not sharing the marital\ncouch, but occupying his own dressing-room. In the morning, however,\nas he sat down to his solitary breakfast, he was as far as ever from\nhaving made up his mind what that something should be. A message\nwas brought to him by an elderly female servant with a grave\nface,--the elderly servant who had lived with them since their\npoorer days,--saying that \"Missus would not come down to breakfast\nthis morning.\" There was no love sent, no excuse as to illness, no\nsemblance of a peaceable reason, assumed even to deceive the servant.\nIt was clear to Mr. Furnival that the servant was intended to know\nall about it. \"And Miss Biggs says, sir, that if you please you're\nnot to wait for her.\"\n\n\"Very well, that'll do,\" said Mr. Furnival, who had not the slightest\nintention of waiting for Miss Biggs; and then he sat himself down to\neat his bacon, and bethink himself what step he would take with this\nrecreant and troublesome spouse.\n\nWhile he was thus employed the post came. The bulk of his letters as\na matter of course went to his chambers; but there were those among\nhis correspondents who wrote to him at Harley Street. To-day he\nreceived three or four letters, but our concern will be with one\nonly. This one bore the Hamworth post-mark, and he opened it the\nfirst, knowing that it came from Lady Mason. It was as follows:--\n\n\n   _Private_\n\n   THE CLEEVE, 23rd January, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. FURNIVAL,\n\n   I am so very sorry that I did not see you to-day! Indeed,\n   your leaving without seeing me has made me unhappy, for I\n   cannot but think that it shows that you are displeased.\n   Under these circumstances I must write to you and explain\n   to you how that came to pass which Sir Peregrine told you.\n   I have not let him know that I am writing to you, and I\n   think for his sake that I had better not. But he is so\n   good, and has shown to me such nobleness and affection,\n   that I can hardly bring myself to have any secret from\n   him.\n\n   You may conceive what was my surprise when I first\n   understood that he wished to make me his wife. It is\n   hardly six months since I thought that I was almost\n   exceeding my station in visiting at his house. Then by\n   degrees I began to be received as a friend, and at last I\n   found myself treated with the warmest love. But still I\n   had no thought of this, and I knew that it was because of\n   my great trouble that Sir Peregrine and Mrs. Orme were so\n   good to me.\n\n   When he sent for me into his library and told me what\n   he wished, I could not refuse him anything. I promised\n   obedience to him as though I were a child; and in this way\n   I found myself engaged to be his wife. When he told me\n   that he would have it so, how could I refuse him, knowing\n   as I do all that he has done for me, and thinking of it\n   as I do every minute? As for loving him, of course I love\n   him. Who that knows him does not love him? He is made to\n   be loved. No one is so good and so noble as he. But of\n   love of that sort I had never dreamed. Ah me, no!--a woman\n   burdened as I am does not think of love.\n\n   He told me that he would have it so, and I said that I\n   would obey him; and he tried to prove to me that in this\n   dreadful trial it would be better for me. But I would not\n   wish it on that account. He has done enough for me without\n   my causing him such injury. When I argued it with him,\n   trying to say that others would not like it, he declared\n   that Mrs. Orme would be well pleased, and, indeed, so she\n   told me afterwards herself. And thus I yielded to him,\n   and agreed that I would be his wife. But I was not happy,\n   thinking that I should injure him; and I promised only\n   because I could not deny him.\n\n   But the day before yesterday young Mr. Orme, his grandson,\n   came to me and told me that such a marriage would be very\n   wrong. And I do believe him. He said that old family\n   friends would look down upon his grandfather and ridicule\n   him if he were to make this marriage. And I can see that\n   it would be so. I would not have such injury come upon him\n   for the gain of all the world to myself. So I have made\n   up my mind to tell him that it cannot be, even though I\n   should anger him. And I fear that it will anger him, for\n   he loves to have his own way,--especially in doing good;\n   and he thinks that our marriage would rescue me altogether\n   from the danger of this trial.\n\n   So I have made up my mind to tell him, but I have not\n   found courage to do it yet; and I do wish, dear Mr.\n   Furnival, that I might see you first. I fear that I may\n   have lost your friendship by what has already been done.\n   If so, what will become of me? When I heard that you had\n   gone without asking for me, my heart sank within me. I\n   have two friends whom I so dearly love, and I would fain\n   do as both direct me, if that may be possible. And now I\n   propose to go up to London to-morrow, and to be at your\n   chambers about one o'clock. I have told Sir Peregrine and\n   Mrs. Orme that I am going; but he is too noble-minded\n   to ask questions now that he thinks I may feel myself\n   constrained to tell him. So I will call in Lincoln's Inn\n   at one o'clock, and I trust that if possible you will see\n   me. I am greatly in want of your advice, for in truth I\n   hardly know what to do.\n\n   Pray believe me to be always your attached friend,\n\n   MARY MASON.\n\n\nThere was hardly a word,--I believe not a word in that letter that\nwas not true. Her acceptance of Sir Peregrine had been given exactly\nin the manner and for the reasons there explained; and since she had\naccepted him she had been sorry for having done so, exactly in the\nway now described. She was quite willing to give up her husband if it\nwas thought best,--but she was not willing to give up her friend. She\nwas not willing to give up either friend, and her great anxiety was\nso to turn her conduct that she might keep them both.\n\nMr. Furnival was gratified as he read the letter--gratified in spite\nof his present frame of mind. Of course he would see her;--and of\ncourse, as he himself well knew, would take her again into favour.\nBut he must insist on her carrying out her purpose of abandoning the\nmarriage project. If, arising from this abandonment, there should\nbe any coolness on the part of Sir Peregrine, Mr. Furnival would\nnot regret it. Mr. Furnival did not feel quite sure whether in the\nconduct of this case he was not somewhat hampered by the--energetic\nzeal of Sir Peregrine's line of defence.\n\nWhen he had finished the perusal of his letter and the consideration\nwhich it required, he put it carefully into his breast coat pocket,\nenvelope and all. What might not happen if he left that envelope\nabout in that house? And then he took it out again, and observed upon\nthe cover the Hamworth post-mark, very clear. Post-marks now-a-days\nare very clear, and everybody may know whence a letter comes. His\nletters had been brought to him by the butler; but was it not\nprobable that that ancient female servant might have seen them first,\nand have conveyed to her mistress intelligence as to this post-mark?\nIf so--; and Mr. Furnival almost felt himself to be guilty as he\nthought of it.\n\nWhile he was putting on his greatcoat in the hall, the butler\nassisting him, the ancient female servant came to him again. There\nwas a look about her face which told of war, and declared her\nto be, if not the chief lieutenant of his wife, at any rate her\ncolour-serjeant. Martha Biggs no doubt was chief lieutenant. \"Missus\ndesires me to ask,\" said she, with her grim face and austere voice,\n\"whether you will be pleased to dine at home to-day?\" And yet the\ngrim, austere woman could be affectionate and almost motherly in her\nministrations to him when things were going well, and had eaten his\nsalt and broken his bread for more than twenty years. All this was\nvery hard! \"Because,\" continued the woman, \"missus says she thinks\nshe shall be out this evening herself.\"\n\n\"Where is she going?\"\n\n\"Missus didn't tell me, sir.\"\n\nHe almost determined to go up stairs and call upon her to tell him\nwhat she was going to do, but he remembered that if he did it would\nsurely make a row in the house. Miss Biggs would put her head out\nof some adjacent door and scream, \"Oh laws!\" and he would have to\ndescend his own stairs with the consciousness that all his household\nwere regarding him as a brute. So he gave up that project. \"No,\" he\nsaid, \"I shall not dine at home;\" and then he went his way.\n\n\"Missus is very aggravating,\" said the butler, as soon as the door\nwas closed.\n\n\"You don't know what cause she has, Spooner,\" said the housekeeper\nvery solemnly.\n\n\"Is it at his age? I believe it's all nonsense, I do;--feminine\nfancies, and vagaries of the weaker sex.\"\n\n\"Yes, I dare say; that's what you men always say. But if he don't\nlook out he'll find missus'll be too much for him. What'd he do if\nshe were to go away from him?\"\n\n\"Do?--why live twice as jolly. It would only be the first rumpus of\nthe thing.\"\n\nI am afraid that there was some truth in what Spooner said. It is the\nfirst rumpus of the thing, or rather the fear of that, which keeps\ntogether many a couple.\n\nAt one o'clock there came a timid female rap at Mr. Furnival's\nchamber door, and the juvenile clerk gave admittance to Lady Mason.\nCrabwitz, since the affair of that mission down at Hamworth, had\nso far carried a point of his, that a junior satellite was now\npermanently installed; and for the future the indignity of opening\ndoors, and \"just stepping out\" into Chancery Lane, would not await\nhim. Lady Mason was dressed all in black,--but this was usual\nwith her when she left home. To-day, however, there was about her\nsomething blacker and more sombre than usual. The veil which she wore\nwas thick, and completely hid her face; and her voice, as she asked\nfor Mr. Furnival, was low and plaintive. But, nevertheless, she had\nby no means laid aside the charm of womanhood; or it might be more\njust to say that the charm of womanhood had not laid aside her. There\nwas that in her figure, step, and gait of going which compelled men\nto turn round and look at her. We all know that she had a son some\ntwo or three and twenty years of age, and that she had not been quite\na girl when she married. But, notwithstanding this, she was yet\nyoung; and though she made no effort--no apparent effort--to maintain\nthe power and influence which beauty gives, yet she did maintain it.\n\nHe came forward and took her by the hand with all his old\naffectionate regard, and, muttering some words of ordinary\nsalutation, led her to a chair. It may be that she muttered something\nalso, but if so the sound was too low to reach his ears. She sat down\nwhere he placed her, and as she put her hand on the table near her\narm, he saw that she was trembling.\n\n\"I got your letter this morning,\" he said, by way of beginning the\nconversation.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; and then, finding that it was not possible that he\nshould hear her through her veil, she raised it. She was very pale,\nand there was a look of painful care, almost of agony, round her\nmouth. He had never seen her look so pale,--but he said to himself at\nthe same time that he had never seen her look so beautiful.\n\n\"And to tell you the truth, Lady Mason, I was very glad to get it.\nYou and I had better speak openly to each other about this;--had we\nnot?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said. And then there was a struggle within her not to\ntremble--a struggle that was only too evident. She was aware of this,\nand took her hand off the table.\n\n\"I vexed you because I did not see you at The Cleeve the other day.\"\n\n\"Because I thought that you were angry with me.\"\n\n\"And I was so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Furnival!\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, Lady Mason. I was angry;--or rather sorry and\nvexed to hear of that which I did not approve. But your letter has\nremoved that feeling. I can now understand the manner in which\nthis engagement was forced upon you; and I understand also--do I\nnot?--that the engagement will not be carried out?\"\n\nShe did not answer him immediately, and he began to fear that\nshe repented of her purpose. \"Because,\" said he, \"under no other\ncircumstances could I--\"\n\n\"Stop, Mr. Furnival. Pray do not be severe with me.\" And she looked\nat him with eyes which would almost have melted his wife,--and which\nhe was quite unable to withstand. Had it been her wish, she might\nhave made him promise to stand by her, even though she had persisted\nin her engagement.\n\n\"No, no; I will not be severe.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to marry him,\" she went on to say. \"I have resolved to\ntell him so. That was what I said in my letter.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"I do not wish to marry him. I would not bring his gray hairs with\nsorrow to the grave--no, not to save myself from--\" And then, as she\nthought of that from which she desired to save herself, she trembled\nagain, and was silent.\n\n\"It would create in men's minds such a strong impression against you,\nwere you to marry him at this moment!\"\n\n\"It is of him I am thinking;--of him and Lucius. Mr. Furnival, they\nmight do their worst with me, if it were not for that thought. My\nboy!\" And then she rose from her chair, and stood upright before him,\nas though she were going to do or say some terrible thing. He still\nkept his chair, for he was startled, and hardly knew what he would be\nabout. That last exclamation had come from her almost with a shriek,\nand now her bosom was heaving as though her heart would burst with\nthe violence of her sobbing. \"I will go,\" she said. \"I had better\ngo.\" And she hurried away towards the door.\n\n\"No, no; do not go yet.\" And he rose to stop her, but she was quite\npassive. \"I do not know why you should be so much moved now.\" But\nhe did know. He did understand the very essence and core of her\nfeelings;--as probably may the reader also. But it was impossible\nthat he should allow her to leave him in her present state.\n\nShe sat down again, and leaning both her arms upon the table, hid\nher face within her hands. He was now standing, and for the moment\ndid not speak to her. Indeed he could not bring himself to break the\nsilence, for he saw her tears, and could still hear the violence of\nher sobs. And then she was the first to speak. \"If it were not for\nhim,\" she said, raising her head, \"I could bear it all. What will he\ndo? what will he do?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said Mr. Furnival, speaking very slowly, \"if\nthe--verdict--should go against us.\"\n\n\"It will go against us,\" she said. \"Will it not?--tell me the truth.\nYou are so clever, you must know. Tell me how it will go. Is there\nanything I can do to save him?\" And she took hold of his arm with\nboth her hands, and looked up eagerly--oh, with such terrible\neagerness!--into his face.\n\nWould it not have been natural now that he should have asked her to\ntell him the truth? And yet he did not dare to ask her. He thought\nthat he knew it. He felt sure,--almost sure, that he could look into\nher very heart, and read there the whole of her secret. But still\nthere was a doubt,--enough of doubt to make him wish to ask the\nquestion. Nevertheless he did not ask it.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival,\" she said; and as she spoke there was a hardness came\nover the soft lines of her feminine face; a look of courage which\namounted almost to ferocity, a look which at the moment recalled\nto his mind, as though it were but yesterday, the attitude and\ncountenance she had borne as she stood in the witness-box at that\nother trial, now so many years since,--that attitude and countenance\nwhich had impressed the whole court with so high an idea of her\ncourage. \"Mr. Furnival, weak as I am, I could bear to die here on the\nspot,--now--if I could only save him from this agony. It is not for\nmyself I suffer.\" And then the terrible idea occurred to him that she\nmight attempt to compass her escape by death. But he did not know\nher. That would have been no escape for her son.\n\n\"And you too think that I must not marry him?\" she said, putting up\nher hands to her brows as though to collect her thoughts.\n\n\"No; certainly not, Lady Mason.\"\n\n\"No, no. It would be wrong. But, Mr. Furnival, I am so driven that I\nknow not how I should act. What if I should lose my mind?\" And as she\nlooked at him there was that about her eyes which did tell him that\nsuch an ending might be possible.\n\n\"Do not speak in such a way,\" he said.\n\n\"No, I will not. I know that it is wrong. I will go down there, and\ntell him that it must not--must not be so. But I may stay at The\nCleeve;--may I not?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly--if he wishes it,--after your understanding with him.\"\n\n\"Ah; he may turn me out, may he not? And they are so kind to me,\nso gentle and so good. And Lucius is so stern. But I will go back.\nSternness will perhaps be better for me now than love and kindness.\"\n\nIn spite of everything, in the teeth of his almost certain conviction\nof her guilt, he would now, even now, have asked her to come to his\nown house, and have begged her to remain there till the trial was\nover,--if only he had had the power to do so. What would it be to him\nwhat the world might say, if she should be proved guilty? Why should\nnot he have been mistaken as well as others? And he had an idea\nthat if he could get her into his own hands he might still bring\nher through triumphantly,--with assistance from Solomon Aram and\nChaffanbrass. He was strongly convinced of her guilt, but by no means\nstrongly convinced that her guilt could be proved. But then he had no\nhouse at the present moment that he could call his own. His Kitty,\nthe Kitty of whom he still sometimes thought with affection,--that\nKitty whose soft motherly heart would have melted at such a story\nof a woman's sorrows, if only it had been rightly approached,--that\nKitty was now vehemently hostile, hostile both to him and to this\nvery woman for whom he would have asked her care.\n\n\"May God help me!\" said the poor woman. \"I do not know where else to\nturn for aid. Well; I may go now then. And, indeed, why should I take\nup your time further?\"\n\nBut before she did go, Mr. Furnival gave her much counsel. He did not\nask as to her guilt, but he did give her that advice which he would\nhave thought most expedient had her guilt been declared and owned. He\ntold her that very much would depend on her maintaining her present\nposition and standing; that she was so to carry herself as not to\nlet people think that she was doubtful about the trial; and that\nabove all things she was to maintain a composed and steadfast manner\nbefore her son. As to the Ormes, he bade her not to think of leaving\nThe Cleeve, unless she found that her remaining there would be\ndisagreeable to Sir Peregrine after her explanation with him. That\nshe was to decline the marriage engagement, he was very positive; on\nthat subject there was to be no doubt.\n\nAnd then she went; and as she passed down the dark passage into the\nnew square by the old gate of the Chancellor's court, she met a stout\nlady. The stout lady eyed her savagely, but was not quite sure as to\nher identity. Lady Mason in her trouble passed the stout lady without\ntaking any notice of her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nJOHN KENNEBY GOES TO HAMWORTH.\n\n\nWhen John Kenneby dined with his sister and brother-in-law on\nChristmas-day he agreed, at the joint advice of the whole party there\nassembled, that he would go down and see Mr. Dockwrath at Hamworth,\nin accordance with the invitation received from that gentleman;--his\nenemy, Dockwrath, who had carried off Miriam Usbech, for whom John\nKenneby still sighed,--in a gentle easy manner indeed,--but still\nsighed as though it were an affair but of yesterday. But though he\nhad so agreed, and though he had never stirred from that resolve, he\nby no means did it immediately. He was a slow man, whose life had\noffered him but little excitement; and the little which came to him\nwas husbanded well and made to go a long way. He thought about this\njourney for nearly a month before he took it, often going to his\nsister and discussing it with her, and once or twice seeing the great\nMoulder himself. At last he fixed a day and did go down to Hamworth.\n\nHe had, moreover, been invited to the offices of Messrs. Round and\nCrook, and that visit also was as yet unpaid. A clerk from the house\nin Bedford Row had found him out at Hubbles and Grease's, and had\ndiscovered that he would be forthcoming as a witness. On the special\nsubject of his evidence not much had then passed, the clerk having\nhad no discretion given him to sift the matter. But Kenneby had\npromised to go to Bedford Row, merely stipulating for a day at some\nlittle distance of time. That day was now near at hand; but he was\nto see Dockwrath first, and hence it occurred that he now made his\njourney to Hamworth.\n\nBut another member of that Christmas party at Great St. Helen's had\nnot been so slow in carrying out his little project. Mr. Kantwise had\nat once made up his mind that it would be as well that he should see\nDockwrath. It would not suit him to incur the expense of a journey\nto Hamworth, even with the additional view of extracting payment for\nthat set of metallic furniture; but he wrote to the attorney telling\nhim that he should be in London in the way of trade on such and such\na day, and that he had tidings of importance to give with reference\nto the great Orley Farm case. Dockwrath did see him, and the result\nwas that Mr. Kantwise got his money, fourteen eleven;--at least he\ngot fourteen seven six, and had a very hard fight for the three odd\nhalf-crowns,--and Dockwrath learned that John Kenneby, if duly used,\nwould give evidence on his side of the question.\n\nAnd then Kenneby did go down to Hamworth. He had not seen Miriam\nUsbech since the days of her marriage. He had remained hanging\nabout the neighbourhood long enough to feast his eyes with the\nagony of looking at the bride, and then he had torn himself away.\nCircumstances since that had carried him one way and Miriam another,\nand they had never met. Time had changed him very little, and what\nchange time had made was perhaps for the better. He hesitated\nless when he spoke, he was less straggling and undecided in his\nappearance, and had about him more of manhood than in former days.\nBut poor Miriam had certainly not been altered for the better by\nyears and circumstances as far as outward appearance went.\n\nKenneby as he walked up from the station to the house,--and from old\nremembrances he knew well where the house stood,--gave up his mind\nentirely to the thought of seeing Miriam, and in his memories of old\nlove passages almost forgot the actual business which now brought him\nto the place. To him it seemed as though he was going to meet the\nsame Miriam he had left,--the Miriam to whom in former days he had\nhardly ventured to speak of love, and to whom he must not now venture\nso to speak at all. He almost blushed as he remembered that he would\nhave to take her hand.\n\nThere are men of this sort, men slow in their thoughts but very keen\nin their memories; men who will look for the glance of a certain\nbright eye from a window-pane, though years have rolled on since\nlast they saw it,--since last they passed that window. Such men will\nbethink themselves, after an interval of weeks, how they might have\nbrought up wit to their use and improved an occasion which chance\nhad given them. But when the bright eyes do glance, such men pass\nby abashed; and when the occasion offers, their wit is never at\nhand. Nevertheless they are not the least happy of mankind, these\nnever-readies; they do not pick up sudden prizes, but they hold\nfast by such good things as the ordinary run of life bestows upon\nthem. There was a lady even now, a friend of Mrs. Moulder, ready to\nbestow herself and her fortune on John Kenneby,--a larger fortune\nthan Miriam had possessed, and one which would not now probably be\nneutralised by so large a family as poor Miriam had bestowed upon her\nhusband.\n\nHow would Miriam meet him? It was of this he thought, as he\napproached the door. Of course he must call her Mrs. Dockwrath,\nthough the other name was so often on his tongue. He had made up\nhis mind, for the last week past, that he would call at the private\ndoor of the house, passing by the door of the office. Otherwise\nthe chances were that he would not see Miriam at all. His enemy,\nDockwrath, would be sure to keep him from her presence. Dockwrath had\never been inordinately jealous. But when he came to the office-door\nhe hardly had the courage to pass on to that of the private dwelling.\nHis heart beat too quickly, and the idea of seeing Miriam was almost\ntoo much for him. But, nevertheless, he did carry out his plan, and\ndid knock at the door of the house.\n\nAnd it was opened by Miriam herself. He knew her instantly in spite\nof all the change. He knew her, but the whole course of his feelings\nwere altered at the moment, and his blood was made to run the other\nway. And she knew him too. \"La, John,\" she said, \"who'd have thought\nof seeing you?\" And she shifted the baby whom she carried from one\narm to the other as she gave him her hand in token of welcome.\n\n[Illustration: John Kenneby and Miriam Dockwrath.]\n\n\"It is a long time since we met,\" he said. He felt hardly any\ntemptation now to call her Miriam. Indeed it would have seemed\naltogether in opposition to the common order of things to do so. She\nwas no longer Miriam, but the maternal Dockwrath;--the mother of that\nlong string of dirty children whom he saw gathered in the passage\nbehind her. He had known as a fact that she had all the children, but\nthe fact had not made the proper impression on his mind till he had\nseen them.\n\n\"A long time! 'Deed then it is. Why we've hardly seen each other\nsince you used to be a courting of me; have we? But, my! John; why\nhaven't you got a wife for yourself these many years? But come in.\nI'm glad to see every bit of you, so I am; though I've hardly a place\nto put you to sit down in.\" And then she opened a door and took him\ninto a little sitting-room on the left-hand side of the passage.\n\nHis feeling of intense enmity to Dockwrath was beginning to wear\naway, and one of modified friendship for the whole family was\nsupervening. It was much better that it should be so. He could not\nunderstand before how Dockwrath had had the heart to write to him and\ncall him John, but now he did understand it. He felt that he could\nhimself be friendly with Dockwrath now, and forgive him all the\ninjury; he felt also that it would not go so much against the grain\nwith him to marry that friend as to whom his sister would so often\nsolicit him.\n\n\"I think you may venture to sit down upon them,\" said Miriam, \"though\nI can't say that I have ever tried myself.\" This speech referred to\nthe chairs with which her room was supplied, and which Kenneby seemed\nto regard with suspicion.\n\n\"They are very nice I'm sure,\" said he, \"but I don't think I ever saw\nany like them.\"\n\n\"Nor nobody else either. But don't you tell him so,\" and she nodded\nwith her head to the side of the house on which the office stood. \"I\nhad as nice a set of mahoganys as ever a woman could want, and bought\nwith my own money too, John; but he's took them away to furnish some\nof his lodgings opposite, and put them things here in their place.\nDon't, Sam; you'll have 'em all twisted about nohows in no time if\nyou go to use 'em in that way.\"\n\n\"I wants to see the pictur' on the table,\" said Sam.\n\n\"Drat the picture,\" said Mrs. Dockwrath. \"It was hard, wasn't it,\nJohn, to see my own mahoganys, as I had rubbed with my own hands till\nthey was ever so bright, and as was bought with my own money too,\ntook away and them things brought here? Sam, if you twist that round\nany more, I'll box your ears. One can't hear oneself speak with the\nnoise.\"\n\n\"They don't seem to be very useful,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"Useful! They're got up for cheatery;--that's what they're got up\nfor. And that Dockwrath should be took in with 'em--he that's so\nsharp at everything,--that's what surprises me. But laws, John, it\nisn't the sharp ones that gets the best off. You was never sharp, but\nyou're as smirk and smooth as though you came out of a band-box. I am\nglad to see you, John, so I am.\" And she put her apron up to her eyes\nand wiped away a tear.\n\n\"Is Mr. Dockwrath at home?\" said John.\n\n\"Sam, run round and see if your father's in the office. He'll be home\nto dinner, I know. Molly, do be quiet with your sister. I never see\nsuch a girl as you are for bothering. You didn't come down about\nbusiness, did you, John?\" And then Kenneby explained to her that he\nhad been summoned by Dockwrath as to the matter of this Orley Farm\ntrial. While he was doing so, Sam returned to say that his father had\nstepped out, but would be back in half an hour, and Mrs. Dockwrath,\nfinding it impossible to make use of her company sitting-room, took\nher old lover into the family apartment which they all ordinarily\noccupied.\n\n\"You can sit down there at any rate without it all crunching under\nyou, up to nothing.\" And she emptied for him as she spoke the seat\nof an old well-worn horse-hair bottomed arm-chair. \"As to them tin\nthings I wouldn't trust myself on one of them; and so I told him,\nangry as it made him. But now about poor Lady Mason--. Sam and Molly,\nyou go into the garden, there's good children. They is so ready with\ntheir ears, John; and he contrives to get everything out of 'em. Now\ndo tell me about this.\"\n\nKenneby could not help thinking that the love match between Miriam\nand her husband had not turned out in all respects well, and I fear\nthat he derived from the thought a certain feeling of consolation.\n\"He\" was spoken about in a manner that did not betoken unfailing love\nand perfect confidence. Perhaps Miriam was at this moment thinking\nthat she might have done better with her youth and her money! She\nwas thinking of nothing of the kind. Her mind was one that dwelt on\nthe present, not on the past. She was unhappy about her furniture,\nunhappy about the frocks of those four younger children, unhappy that\nthe loaves of bread went faster and faster every day, very unhappy\nnow at the savageness with which her husband prosecuted his anger\nagainst Lady Mason. But it did not occur to her to be unhappy because\nshe had not become Mrs. Kenneby.\n\nMrs. Dockwrath had more to tell in the matter than had Kenneby, and\nwhen the elder of the children who were at home had been disposed of\nshe was not slow to tell it. \"Isn't it dreadful, John, to think that\nthey should come against her now, and the will all settled as it was\ntwenty year ago? But you won't say anything against her; will you\nnow, John? She was always a good friend to you; wasn't she? Though\nit wasn't much use; was it?\" It was thus that she referred to the\nbusiness before them, and to the love passages of her early youth at\nthe same time.\n\n\"It's a very dreadful affair,\" said Kenneby, very solemnly; \"and the\nmore I think of it the more dreadful it becomes.\"\n\n\"But you won't say anything against her, will you? You won't go over\nto his side; eh, John?\"\n\n\"I don't know much about sides,\" said he.\n\n\"He'll get himself into trouble with it; I know he will. I do so wish\nyou'd tell him, for he can't hurt you if you stand up to him. If I\nspeak,--Lord bless you, I don't dare to call my soul my own for a\nweek afterwards.\"\n\n\"Is he so very--\"\n\n\"Oh, dreadful, John. He's bid me never speak a word to her. But for\nall that I used till she went away down to The Cleeve yonder. And\nwhat do you think they say now? And I do believe it too. They say\nthat Sir Peregrine is going to make her his lady. If he does that it\nstands to reason that Dockwrath and Joseph Mason will get the worst\nof it. I'm sure I hope they will; only he'll be twice as hard if he\ndon't make money by it in some way.\"\n\n\"Will he, now?\"\n\n\"Indeed he will. You never knew anything like him for hardness if\nthings go wrong awhile. I know he's got lots of money, because he's\nalways buying up bits of houses; besides, what has he done with mine?\nbut yet sometimes you'd hardly think he'd let me have bread enough\nfor the children--and as for clothes--!\" Poor Miriam! It seemed that\nher husband shared with her but few of the spoils or triumphs of his\nprofession.\n\nTidings now came in from the office that Dockwrath was there. \"You'll\ncome round and eat a bit of dinner with us?\" said she, hesitatingly.\nHe felt that she hesitated, and hesitated himself in his reply. \"He\nmust say something in the way of asking you, you know, and then say\nyou'll come. His manner's nothing to you, you know. Do now. It does\nme good to look at you, John; it does indeed.\" And then, without\nmaking any promise, he left her and went round to the office.\n\nKenneby had made up his mind, talking over the matter with Moulder\nand his sister, that he would be very reserved in any communication\nwhich he might make to Dockwrath as to his possible evidence at the\ncoming trial; but nevertheless when Dockwrath had got him into his\noffice, the attorney made him give a succinct account of everything\nhe knew, taking down his deposition in a regular manner. \"And now if\nyou'll just sign that,\" Dockwrath said to him when he had done.\n\n\"I don't know about signing,\" said Kenneby. \"A man should never write\nhis own name unless he knows why.\"\n\n\"You must sign your own deposition;\" and the attorney frowned at him\nand looked savage. \"What would a judge say to you in court if you had\nmade such a statement as this, affecting the character of a woman\nlike Lady Mason, and then had refused to sign it? You'd never be able\nto hold up your head again.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't I?\" said Kenneby gloomily; and he did sign it. This was a\ngreat triumph to Dockwrath. Mat Round had succeeded in getting the\ndeposition of Bridget Bolster, but he had got that of John Kenneby.\n\n\"And now,\" said Dockwrath, \"I'll tell you what we'll do;--we'll go to\nthe Blue Posts--you remember the Blue Posts?--and I'll stand a beef\nsteak and a glass of brandy and water. I suppose you'll go back to\nLondon by the 3 P.M. train. We shall have lots of time.\"\n\nKenneby said that he should go back by the 3 P.M. train, but he\ndeclined, with considerable hesitation, the beefsteak and brandy and\nwater. After what had passed between him and Miriam he could not go\nto the Blue Posts with her husband.\n\n\"Nonsense, man,\" said Dockwrath. \"You must dine somewhere.\"\n\nBut Kenneby said that he should dine in London. He always preferred\ndining late. Besides, it was a long time since he had been at\nHamworth, and he was desirous of taking a walk that he might renew\nhis associations.\n\n\"Associations!\" said Dockwrath with a sneer. According to his ideas\na man could have no pleasant associations with a place unless he had\nmade money there or been in some way successful. Now John Kenneby\nhad enjoyed no success at Hamworth. \"Well then, if you prefer\nassociations to the Blue Posts I'll say good-bye to you. I don't\nunderstand it myself. We shall see each other at the trial you know.\"\nKenneby with a sigh said that he supposed they should.\n\n\"Are you going into the house,\" said Dockwrath, \"to see her again?\"\nand he indicated with his head the side on which his wife was, as she\nbefore had indicated his side.\n\n\"Well, yes; I think I'll say good-bye.\"\n\n\"Don't be talking to her about this affair. She understands nothing\nabout it, and everything goes up to that woman at Orley Farm.\" And so\nthey parted.\n\n\"And he wanted you to go to the Blue Posts, did he?\" said Miriam when\nshe heard of the proposition. \"It's like him. If there is to be any\nmoney spent it's anywhere but at home.\"\n\n\"But I ain't going,\" said John.\n\n\"He'll go before the day's out, though he mayn't get his dinner\nthere. And he'll be ever so free when he's there. He'll stand brandy\nand water to half Hamworth when he thinks he can get anything by\nit; but if you'll believe me, John, though I've all the fag of the\nhouse on me, and all them children, I can't get a pint of beer--not\nregular--betwixt breakfast and bedtime.\" Poor Miriam! Why had she not\ntaken advice when she was younger? John Kenneby would have given her\nwhat beer was good for her, quite regularly.\n\nThen he went out and took his walk, sauntering away to the gate of\nOrley Farm, and looking up the avenue. He ventured up some way, and\nthere at a distance before him he saw Lucius Mason walking up and\ndown, from the house towards the road and back again, swinging a\nheavy stick in his hand, with his hat pressed down over his brows.\nKenneby had no desire to speak to him; so he returned to the gate,\nand thence went back to the station, escaping the town by a side\nlane; and in this way he got back to London without holding further\ncommunication with the people of Hamworth.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nJOHN KENNEBY'S COURTSHIP.\n\n\n\"She's as sweet a temper, John, as ever stirred a lump of sugar in\nher tea,\" said Mrs. Moulder to her brother, as they sat together over\nthe fire in Great St. Helen's on that same evening,--after his return\nfrom Hamworth. \"That she is,--and so Smiley always found her. 'She's\nalways the same,' Smiley said to me many a day. And what can a man\nwant more than that?\"\n\n\"That's quite true,\" said John.\n\n\"And then as to her habits--I never knew her take a drop too much\nsince first I set eyes on her, and that's nigh twenty years ago. She\nlikes things comfortable;--and why shouldn't she, with two hundred a\nyear of her own coming out of the Kingsland Road brick-fields? As for\ndress, her things is beautiful, and she is the woman that takes care\nof 'em! Why, I remember an Irish tabinet as Smiley gave her when\nfirst that venture in the brick-fields came up money; if that tabinet\nis as much as turned yet, why, I'll eat it. And then, the best of\nit is, she'll have you to-morrow. Indeed she will; or to-night, if\nyou'll ask her. Goodness gracious! if there ain't Moulder!\" And the\nexcellent wife jumped up from her seat, poked the fire, emptied the\nmost comfortable arm-chair, and hurried out to the landing at the top\nof the stairs. Presently the noise of a loudly wheezing pair of lungs\nwas heard, and the commercial traveller, enveloped from head to foot\nin coats and comforters, made his appearance. He had just returned\nfrom a journey, and having deposited his parcels and packages at\nthe house of business of Hubbles and Grease in Houndsditch, had now\nreturned to the bosom of his family. It was a way he had, not to let\nhis wife know exactly the period of his return. Whether he thought\nthat by so doing he might keep her always on the alert and ready for\nmarital inspection, or whether he disliked to tie himself down by the\nobligation of a fixed time for his return, Mrs. Moulder had never\nmade herself quite sure. But on neither view of the subject did she\nadmire this practice of her lord. She had on many occasions pointed\nout to him how much more snug she could make him if he would only let\nher know when he was coming. But he had never taken the hint, and in\nthese latter days she had ceased to give it.\n\n\"Why, I'm uncommon cold,\" he said in answer to his wife's inquiries\nafter his welfare. \"And so would you be too, if you'd come up from\nLeeds since you'd had your dinner. What, John, are you there? The two\nof you are making yourself snug enough, I suppose, with something\nhot?\"\n\n\"Not a drop he's had yet since he's been in the house,\" said Mrs.\nMoulder. \"And he's hardly as much as darkened the door since you\nleft it.\" And Mrs. Moulder added, with some little hesitation in her\nvoice, \"Mrs. Smiley is coming in to-night, Moulder.\"\n\n\"The d---- she is! There's always something of that kind when I gets\nhome tired out, and wants to be comfortable. I mean to have my supper\nto myself, as I likes it, if all the Mother Smileys in London choose\nto come the way. What on earth is she coming here for this time of\nnight?\"\n\n\"Why, Moulder, you know.\"\n\n\"No; I don't know. I only know this, that when a man's used up with\nbusiness he don't want to have any of that nonsense under his nose.\"\n\n\"If you mean me--\" began John Kenneby.\n\n\"I don't mean you; of course not; and I don't mean anybody. Here,\ntake my coats, will you? and let me have a pair of slippers. If Mrs.\nSmiley thinks that I'm going to change my pants, or put myself about\nfor her--\"\n\n\"Laws, Moulder, she don't expect that.\"\n\n\"She won't get it any way. Here's John dressed up as if he was\ngoing to a box in the the-atre. And you--why should you be going to\nexpense, and knocking out things that costs money, because Mother\nSmiley's coming? I'll Smiley her.\"\n\n\"Now, Moulder--\" But Mrs. Moulder knew that it was of no use speaking\nto him at the present moment. Her task should be this,--to feed and\ncosset him if possible into good humour before her guest should\narrive. Her praises of Mrs. Smiley had been very fairly true. But\nnevertheless she was a lady who had a mind and voice of her own,\nas any lady has a right to possess who draws in her own right two\nhundred a year out of a brick-field in the Kingsland Road. Such a one\nknows that she is above being snubbed, and Mrs. Smiley knew this of\nherself as well as any lady; and if Moulder, in his wrath, should\ncall her Mother Smiley, or give her to understand that he regarded\nher as an old woman, that lady would probably walk herself off in a\ngreat dudgeon,--herself and her share in the brick-field. To tell the\ntruth, Mrs. Smiley required that considerable deference should be\npaid to her.\n\nMrs. Moulder knew well what was her husband's present ailment. He had\ndined as early as one, and on his journey up from Leeds to London had\nrefreshed himself with drink only. That last glass of brandy which\nhe had taken at the Peterborough station had made him cross. If she\ncould get him to swallow some hot food before Mrs. Smiley came, all\nmight yet be well.\n\n\"And what's it to be, M.?\" she said in her most insinuating\nvoice--\"there's a lovely chop down stairs, and there's nothing so\nquick as that.\"\n\n\"Chop!\" he said, and it was all he did say at the moment.\n\n\"There's a 'am in beautiful cut,\" she went on, showing by the urgency\nof her voice how anxious she was on the subject.\n\nFor the moment he did not answer her at all, but sat facing the fire,\nand running his fat fingers through his uncombed hair. \"Mrs. Smiley!\"\nhe said; \"I remember when she was kitchen-maid at old Pott's.\"\n\n\"She ain't nobody's kitchen-maid now,\" said Mrs. Moulder, almost\nprepared to be angry in the defence of her friend.\n\n\"And I never could make out when it was that Smiley married\nher,--that is, if he ever did.\"\n\n\"Now, Moulder, that's shocking of you. Of course he married her. She\nand I is nearly an age as possible, though I think she is a year over\nme. She says not, and it ain't nothing to me. But I remember the\nwedding as if it was yesterday. You and I had never set eyes on each\nother then, M.\" This last she added in a plaintive tone, hoping to\nsoften him.\n\n\"Are you going to keep me here all night without anything?\" he then\nsaid. \"Let me have some whisky,--hot, with;--and don't stand there\nlooking at nothing.\"\n\n\"But you'll take some solids with it, Moulder? Why it stands to\nreason you'll be famished.\"\n\n\"Do as you're bid, will you, and give me the whisky. Are you going to\ntell me when I'm to eat and when I'm to drink, like a child?\" This he\nsaid in that tone of voice which made Mrs. Moulder know that he meant\nto be obeyed; and though she was sure that he would make himself\ndrunk, she was compelled to minister to his desires. She got the\nwhisky and hot water, the lemon and sugar, and set the things beside\nhim; and then she retired to the sofa. John Kenneby the while sat\nperfectly silent looking on. Perhaps he was considering whether he\nwould be able to emulate the domestic management of Dockwrath or of\nMoulder when he should have taken to himself Mrs. Smiley and the\nKingsland brick-field.\n\n\"If you've a mind to help yourself, John, I suppose you'll do it,\"\nsaid Moulder.\n\n\"None for me just at present, thank'ee,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"I suppose you wouldn't swallow nothing less than wine in them togs?\"\nsaid the other, raising his glass to his lips. \"Well, here's better\nluck, and I'm blessed if it's not wanting. I'm pretty well tired of\nthis go, and so I mean to let 'em know pretty plainly.\"\n\nAll this was understood by Mrs. Moulder, who knew that it only\nsignified that her husband was half tipsy, and that in all\nprobability he would be whole tipsy before long. There was no\nhelp for it. Were she to remonstrate with him in his present mood,\nhe would very probably fling the bottle at her head. Indeed,\nremonstrances were never of avail with him. So she sat herself down,\nthinking how she would run down when she heard Mrs. Smiley's step,\nand beg that lady to postpone her visit. Indeed it would be well to\nsend John to convey her home again.\n\nMoulder swallowed his glass of hot toddy fast, and then mixed\nanother. His eyes were very bloodshot, and he sat staring at the\nfire. His hands were thrust into his pockets between the periods of\nhis drinking, and he no longer spoke to any one. \"I'm ---- if I stand\nit,\" he growled forth, addressing himself. \"I've stood it a ---- deal\ntoo long.\" And then he finished the second glass. There was a sort\nof understanding on the part of his wife that such interjections\nas these referred to Hubbles and Grease, and indicated a painfully\nadvanced state of drink. There was one hope; the double heat, that of\nthe fire and of the whisky, might make him sleep; and if so, he would\nbe safe for two or three hours.\n\n\"I'm blessed if I do, and that's all,\" said Moulder, grasping the\nwhisky-bottle for the third time. His wife sat behind him very\nanxious, but not daring to interfere. \"It's going over the table,\nM.,\" she then said.\n\n\"D---- the table!\" he answered; and then his head fell forward on his\nbreast, and he was fast asleep with the bottle in his hand.\n\n\"Put your hand to it, John,\" said Mrs. Moulder in a whisper. But John\nhesitated. The lion might rouse himself if his prey were touched.\n\n\"He'll let it go easy if you put your hand to it. He's safe enough\nnow. There. If we could only get him back from the fire a little, or\nhis face'll be burnt off of him.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't move him?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; we'll try. I've done it before, and he's never stirred.\nCome here, just behind. The casters is good, I know. Laws! ain't he\nheavy?\" And then they slowly dragged him back. He grunted out some\nhalf-pronounced threat as they moved him; but he did not stir, and\nhis wife knew that she was again mistress of the room for the next\ntwo hours. It was true that he snored horribly, but then she was used\nto that.\n\n\"You won't let her come up, will you?\" said John.\n\n\"Why not? She knows what men is as well I do. Smiley wasn't that way\noften, I believe; but he was awful when he was. He wouldn't sleep it\noff, quite innocent, like that; but would break everything about the\nplace, and then cry like a child after it. Now Moulder's got none of\nthat about him. The worst of it is, how am I ever to get him into bed\nwhen he wakes?\"\n\nWhile the anticipation of this great trouble was still on her mind,\nthe ring at the bell was heard, and John Kenneby went down to the\nouter door that he might pay to Mrs. Smiley the attention of waiting\nupon her up stairs. And up stairs she came, bristling with silk--the\nidentical Irish tabinet, perhaps, which had never been turned--and\nconscious of the business which had brought her.\n\n\"What--Moulder's asleep is he?\" she said as she entered the room. \"I\nsuppose that's as good as a pair of gloves, any way.\"\n\n\"He ain't just very well,\" said Mrs. Moulder, winking at her friend;\n\"he's tired after a long journey.\"\n\n\"Oh-h! ah-h!\" said Mrs. Smiley, looking down upon the sleeping\nbeauty, and understanding everything at a glance. \"It's uncommon bad\nfor him, you know, because he's so given to flesh.\"\n\n\"It's as much fatigue as anything,\" said the wife.\n\n\"Yes, I dare say;\" and Mrs. Smiley shook her head. \"If he fatigues\nhimself so much as that often he'll soon be off the hooks.\"\n\nMuch was undoubtedly to be borne from two hundred a year in a\nbrick-field, especially when that two hundred a year was coming so\nvery near home; but there is an amount of impertinent familiarity\nwhich must be put down even in two hundred a year. \"I've known worse\ncases than him, my dear; and that ended worse.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say. But you're mistook if you mean Smiley. It was\n'sepilus as took him off, as everybody knows.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, I'm sure I'm not going to say anything against that.\nAnd now, John, do help her off with her bonnet and shawl, while I get\nthe tea-things.\"\n\nMrs. Smiley was a firm set, healthy-looking woman of--about forty.\nShe had large, dark, glassy eyes, which were bright without\nsparkling. Her cheeks were very red, having a fixed settled colour\nthat never altered with circumstances. Her black wiry hair was\nended in short crisp curls, which sat close to her head. It almost\ncollected like a wig, but the hair was in truth her own. Her mouth\nwas small, and her lips thin, and they gave to her face a look of\nsharpness that was not quite agreeable. Nevertheless she was not a\nbad-looking woman, and with such advantages as two hundred a year and\nthe wardrobe which Mrs. Moulder had described, was no doubt entitled\nto look for a second husband.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Kenneby, and how do you find yourself this cold weather?\nDear, how he do snore; don't he?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Kenneby, very thoughtfully, \"he does rather.\" He was\nthinking of Miriam Usbech as she was twenty years ago, and of Mrs.\nSmiley as she appeared at present. Not that he felt inclined to\ngrumble at the lot prepared for him, but that he would like to take a\nfew more years to think about it.\n\nAnd then they sat down to tea. The lovely chops which Moulder had\ndespised, and the ham in beautiful cut which had failed to tempt\nhim, now met with due appreciation. Mrs. Smiley, though she had\nnever been known to take a drop too much, did like to have things\ncomfortable; and on this occasion she made an excellent meal,\nwith a large pocket-handkerchief of Moulder's--brought in for the\noccasion--stretched across the broad expanse of the Irish tabinet.\n\"We sha'n't wake him, shall we?\" said she, as she took her last bit\nof muffin.\n\n\"Not till he wakes natural, of hisself,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"When\nhe's worked it off, he'll rouse himself, and I shall have to get him\nto bed.\"\n\n\"He'll be a bit patchy then, won't he?\"\n\n\"Well, just for a while of course he will,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"But\nthere's worse than him. To-morrow morning, maybe, he'll be just as\nsweet as sweet. It don't hang about him, sullen like. That's what I\nhate, when it hangs about 'em.\" Then the tea-things were taken away,\nMrs. Smiley in her familiarity assisting in the removal, and--in\nspite of the example now before them--some more sugar and some more\nspirits, and some more hot water were put upon the table. \"Well,\nI don't mind just the least taste in life, Mrs. Moulder, as we're\nquite between friends; and I'm sure you'll want it to-night to keep\nyourself up.\" Mrs. Moulder would have answered these last words with\nsome severity had she not felt that good humour now might be of great\nvalue to her brother.\n\n\"Well, John, and what is it you've got to say to her?\" said Mrs.\nMoulder, as she put down her empty glass. Between friends who\nunderstood each other so well, and at their time of life, what was\nthe use of ceremony?\n\n\"La, Mrs. Moulder, what should he have got to say? Nothing I'm sure\nas I'd think of listening to.\"\n\n\"You try her, John.\"\n\n\"Not but what I've the greatest respect in life for Mr. Kenneby,\nand always did have. If you must have anything to do with men, I've\nalways said, recommend me to them as is quiet and steady, and hasn't\ngot too much of the gab;--a quiet man is the man for me any day.\"\n\n\"Well, John?\" said Mrs. Moulder.\n\n\"Now, Mrs. Moulder, can't you keep yourself to yourself, and we shall\ndo very well. Laws, how he do snore! When his head goes bobbing that\nway I do so fear he'll have a fit.\"\n\n\"No he won't; he's coming to, all right. Well, John?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I shall be very happy,\" said John, \"if she likes it. She\nsays that she respects me, and I'm sure I've a great respect for her.\nI always had--even when Mr. Smiley was alive.\"\n\n\"It's very good of you to say so,\" said she; not speaking however as\nthough she were quite satisfied. What was the use of his remembering\nSmiley just at present?\n\n\"Enough's enough between friends any day,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"So\ngive her your hand, John.\"\n\n\"I think it'll be right to say one thing first,\" said Kenneby, with a\nsolemn and deliberate tone.\n\n\"And what's that?\" said Mrs. Smiley, eagerly.\n\n\"In such a matter as this,\" continued Kenneby, \"where the hearts are\nconcerned--\"\n\n\"You didn't say anything about hearts yet,\" said Mrs. Smiley, with\nsome measure of approbation in her voice.\n\n\"Didn't I?\" said Kenneby. \"Then it was an omission on my part, and I\nbeg leave to apologise. But what I was going to say is this: when the\nhearts are concerned, everything should be honest and above-board.\"\n\n\"Oh of course,\" said Mrs. Moulder; \"and I'm sure she don't suspect\nnothing else.\"\n\n\"You'd better let him go on,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"My heart has not been free from woman's lovely image.\"\n\n\"And isn't free now, is it, John?\" said Mrs. Moulder.\n\n\"I've had my object, and though she's been another's, still I've kept\nher image on my heart.\"\n\n\"But it ain't there any longer, John? He's speaking of twenty years\nago, Mrs. Smiley.\"\n\n\"It's quite beautiful to hear him,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Go on, Mr.\nKenneby.\"\n\n\"The years are gone by as though they was nothing, and still I've had\nher image on my heart. I've seen her to-day.\"\n\n\"Her gentleman's still alive, ain't he?\" asked Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"And likely to live,\" said Mrs. Moulder.\n\n\"I've seen her to-day,\" Kenneby continued; \"and now the Adriatic's\nfree to wed another.\"\n\nNeither of the ladies present exactly understood the force of the\nquotation; but as it contained an appropriate reference to marriage,\nand apparently to a second marriage, it was taken by both of them in\ngood part. He was considered to have made his offer, and Mrs. Smiley\nthereupon formally accepted him. \"He's spoke quite handsome, I'm\nsure,\" said Mrs. Smiley to his sister; \"and I don't know that any\nwoman has a right to expect more. As to the brick-fields--.\" And then\nthere was a slight reference to business, with which it will not be\nnecessary that the readers of this story should embarrass themselves.\n\nSoon after that Mr. Kenneby saw Mrs. Smiley home in a cab, and poor\nMrs. Moulder sat by her lord till he roused himself from his sleep.\nLet us hope that her troubles with him were as little vexatious as\npossible; and console ourselves with the reflection that at twelve\no'clock the next morning, after the second bottle of soda and brandy,\nhe was \"as sweet as sweet.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nSHOWING HOW LADY MASON COULD BE VERY NOBLE.\n\n\nLady Mason returned to The Cleeve after her visit to Mr. Furnival's\nchambers, and nobody asked her why she had been to London or whom she\nhad seen. Nothing could be more gracious than the deference which was\nshown to her, and the perfect freedom of action which was accorded\nto her. On that very day Lady Staveley had called at The Cleeve,\nexplaining to Sir Peregrine and Mrs. Orme that her visit was made\nexpressly to Lady Mason. \"I should have called at Orley Farm, of\ncourse,\" said Lady Staveley, \"only that I hear that Lady Mason is\nlikely to prolong her visit with you. I must trust to you, Mrs. Orme,\nto make all that understood.\" Sir Peregrine took upon himself to say\nthat it all should be understood, and then drawing Lady Staveley\naside, told her of his own intended marriage. \"I cannot but be\naware,\" he said, \"that I have no business to trouble you with an\naffair that is so exclusively our own; but I have a wish, which\nperhaps you may understand, that there should be no secret about it.\nI think it better, for her sake, that it should be known. If the\nconnection can be of any service to her, she should reap that benefit\nnow, when some people are treating her name with a barbarity which\nI believe to be almost unparalleled in this country.\" In answer to\nthis Lady Staveley was of course obliged to congratulate him, and she\ndid so with the best grace in her power; but it was not easy to say\nmuch that was cordial, and as she drove back with Mrs. Arbuthnot to\nNoningsby the words which were said between them as to Lady Mason\nwere not so kindly meant towards that lady as their remarks on their\njourney to The Cleeve.\n\nLady Staveley had hoped,--though she had hardly expressed her hope\neven to herself, and certainly had not spoken of it to any one\nelse,--that she might have been able to say a word or two to Mrs.\nOrme about young Peregrine, a word or two that would have shown her\nown good feeling towards the young man,--her own regard, and almost\naffection for him, even though this might have been done without\nany mention of Madeline's name. She might have learned in this way\nwhether young Orme had made known at home what had been his hopes and\nwhat his disappointments, and might have formed some opinion whether\nor no he would renew his suit. She would not have been the first to\nmention her daughter's name; but if Mrs. Orme should speak of it,\nthen the subject would be free for her, and she could let it be known\nthat the heir of The Cleeve should at any rate have her sanction and\ngood will. What happiness could be so great for her as that of having\na daughter so settled, within eight miles of her? And then it was not\nonly that a marriage between her daughter and Peregrine Orme would be\nan event so fortunate, but also that those feelings with reference\nto Felix Graham were so unfortunate! That young heart, she thought,\ncould not as yet be heavy laden, and it might be possible that the\nwhole affair should be made to run in the proper course,--if only\nit could be done at once. But now, that tale which Sir Peregrine\nhad told her respecting himself and Lady Mason had made it quite\nimpossible that anything should be said on the other subject. And\nthen again, if it was decreed that the Noningsby family and the\nfamily of The Cleeve should be connected, would not such a marriage\nas this between the baronet and Lady Mason be very injurious? So that\nLady Staveley was not quite happy as she returned to her own house.\n\nLady Staveley's message, however, for Lady Mason was given with all\nits full force. Sir Peregrine had felt grateful for what had been\ndone, and Mrs. Orme, in talking of it, made quite the most of it.\nCivility from the Staveleys to the Ormes would not, in the ordinary\ncourse of things, be accounted of any special value. The two families\nmight, and naturally would, know each other on intimate terms. But\nthe Ormes would as a matter of course stand the highest in general\nestimation. Now, however, the Ormes had to bear up Lady Mason with\nthem. Sir Peregrine had so willed it, and Mrs. Orme had not for a\nmoment thought of contesting the wish of one whose wishes she had\nnever contested. No words were spoken on the subject; but still with\nboth of them there was a feeling that Lady Staveley's countenance\nand open friendship would be of value. When it had come to this\nwith Sir Peregrine Orme, he was already disgraced in his own\nestimation,--already disgraced, although he declared to himself a\nthousand times that he was only doing his duty as a gentleman.\n\nOn that evening Lady Mason said no word of her new purpose. She\nhad pledged herself both to Peregrine Orme and to Mr. Furnival. To\nboth she had made a distinct promise that she would break off her\nengagement, and she knew well that the deed should be done at once.\nBut how was she to do it? With what words was she to tell him that\nshe had changed her mind and would not take the hand that he had\noffered to her? She feared to be a moment alone with Peregrine lest\nhe should tax her with the non-fulfilment of her promise. But in\ntruth Peregrine at the present moment was thinking more of another\nmatter. It had almost come home to him that his grandfather's\nmarriage might facilitate his own; and though he still was far from\nreconciling himself to the connection with Lady Mason, he was almost\ndisposed to put up with it.\n\nOn the following day, at about noon, a chariot with a pair of\npost-horses was brought up to the door of The Cleeve at a very fast\npace, and the two ladies soon afterwards learned that Lord Alston was\ncloseted with Sir Peregrine. Lord Alston was one of Sir Peregrine's\noldest friends. He was a man senior both in age and standing to the\nbaronet; and, moreover, he was a friend who came but seldom to The\nCleeve, although his friendship was close and intimate. Nothing was\nsaid between Mrs. Orme and Lady Mason, but each dreaded that Lord\nAlston had come to remonstrate about the marriage. And so in truth he\nhad. The two old men were together for about an hour, and then Lord\nAlston took his departure without asking for, or seeing any other\none of the family. Lord Alston had remonstrated about the marriage,\nusing at last very strong language to dissuade the baronet from\na step which he thought so unfortunate; but he had remonstrated\naltogether in vain. Every word he had used was not only fruitless,\nbut injurious; for Sir Peregrine was a man whom it was very difficult\nto rescue by opposition, though no man might be more easily led by\nassumed acquiescence.\n\n\"Orme, my dear fellow,\" said his lordship, towards the end of the\ninterview, \"it is my duty, as an old friend, to tell you this.\"\n\n\"Then, Lord Alston, you have done your duty.\"\n\n\"Not while a hope remains that I may prevent this marriage.\"\n\n\"There is ground for no such hope on your part; and permit me to\nsay that the expression of such a hope to me is greatly wanting in\ncourtesy.\"\n\n\"You and I,\" continued Lord Alston, without apparent attention to the\nlast words which Sir Peregrine had spoken, \"have nearly come to the\nend of our tether here. Our careers have been run; and I think I may\nsay as regards both, but I may certainly say as regards you, that\nthey have been so run that we have not disgraced those who preceded\nus. Our dearest hopes should be that our names may never be held as a\nreproach by those who come after us.\"\n\n\"With God's blessing I will do nothing to disgrace my family.\"\n\n\"But, Orme, you and I cannot act as may those whose names in the\nworld are altogether unnoticed. I know that you are doing this from a\nfeeling of charity to that lady.\"\n\n\"I am doing it, Lord Alston, because it so pleases me.\"\n\n\"But your first charity is due to your grandson. Suppose that he was\nmaking an offer of his hand to the daughter of some nobleman,--as he\nis so well entitled to do,--how would it affect his hopes if it were\nknown that you at the time had married a lady whose misfortune made\nit necessary that she should stand at the bar in a criminal court?\"\n\n\"Lord Alston,\" said Sir Peregrine, rising from his chair, \"I trust\nthat my grandson may never rest his hopes on any woman whose heart\ncould be hardened against him by such a thought as that.\"\n\n\"But what if she should be guilty?\" said Lord Alston.\n\n\"Permit me to say,\" said Sir Peregrine, still standing, and standing\nnow bolt upright, as though his years did not weigh on him a feather,\n\"that this conversation has gone far enough. There are some surmises\nto which I cannot listen, even from Lord Alston.\"\n\nThen his lordship shrugged his shoulders, declared that in speaking\nas he had spoken he had endeavoured to do a friendly duty by an old\nfriend,--certainly the oldest, and almost the dearest friend he\nhad,--and so he took his leave. The wheels of the chariot were heard\ngrating over the gravel, as he was carried away from the door at a\ngallop, and the two ladies looked into each other's faces, saying\nnothing. Sir Peregrine was not seen from that time till dinner; but\nwhen he did come into the drawing-room his manner to Lady Mason was,\nif possible, more gracious and more affectionate than ever.\n\n\"So Lord Alston was here to-day,\" Peregrine said to his mother that\nnight before he went to bed.\n\n\"Yes, he was here.\"\n\n\"It was about this marriage, mother, as sure as I am standing here.\"\n\n\"I don't think Lord Alston would interfere about that, Perry.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he? He would interfere about anything he did not like; that\nis, as far as the pluck of it goes. Of course he can't like it. Who\ncan?\"\n\n\"Perry, your grandfather likes it; and surely he has a right to\nplease himself.\"\n\n\"I don't know about that. You might say the same thing if he wanted\nto kill all the foxes about the place, or do any other outlandish\nthing. Of course he might kill them, as far as the law goes, but\nwhere would he be afterwards? She hasn't said anything to him, has\nshe?\"\n\n\"I think not.\"\n\n\"Nor to you?\"\n\n\"No; she has not spoken to me; not about that.\"\n\n\"She promised me positively that she would break it off.\"\n\n\"You must not be hard on her, Perry.\"\n\nJust as these words were spoken, there came a low knock at Mrs.\nOrme's dressing-room door. This room, in which Mrs. Orme was wont to\nsit for an hour or so every night before she went to bed, was the\nscene of all the meetings of affection which took place between the\nmother and the son. It was a pretty little apartment, opening from\nMrs. Orme's bed-room, which had at one time been the exclusive\nproperty of Peregrine's father. But by degrees it had altogether\nassumed feminine attributes; had been furnished with soft chairs,\na sofa, and a lady's table; and though called by the name of Mrs.\nOrme's dressing-room, was in fact a separate sitting-room devoted to\nher exclusive use. Sir Peregrine would not for worlds have entered it\nwithout sending up his name beforehand, and this he did on only very\nrare occasions. But Lady Mason had of late been admitted here, and\nMrs. Orme now knew that it was her knock.\n\n\"Open the door, Perry,\" she said; \"it is Lady Mason.\" He did open the\ndoor, and Lady Mason entered.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Orme, I did not know that you were here.\"\n\n\"I am just off. Good night, mother.\"\n\n\"But I am disturbing you.\"\n\n\"No, we had done;\" and he stooped down and kissed his mother. \"Good\nnight, Lady Mason. Hadn't I better put some coals on for you, or the\nfire will be out?\" He did put on the coals, and then he went his way.\n\nLady Mason while he was doing this had sat down on the sofa, close\nto Mrs. Orme; but when the door was closed Mrs. Orme was the first\nto speak. \"Well, dear,\" she said, putting her hand caressingly on\nthe other's arm. I am inclined to think that had there been no one\nwhom Mrs. Orme was bound to consult but herself, she would have\nwished that this marriage should have gone on. To her it would have\nbeen altogether pleasant to have had Lady Mason ever with her in\nthe house; and she had none of those fears as to future family\nretrospections respecting which Lord Alston had spoken with so much\nknowledge of the world. As it was, her manner was so caressing and\naffectionate to her guest, that she did much more to promote Sir\nPeregrine's wishes than to oppose them. \"Well, dear,\" she said, with\nher sweetest smile.\n\n\"I am so sorry that I have driven your son away.\"\n\n\"He was going. Besides, it would make no matter; he would stay here\nall night sometimes, if I didn't drive him away myself. He comes here\nand writes his letters at the most unconscionable hours, and uses up\nall my note-paper in telling some horsekeeper what is to be done with\nhis mare.\"\n\n\"Ah, how happy you must be to have him!\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose I am,\" she said, as a tear came into her eyes.\n\"We are so hard to please. I am all anxiety now that he should be\nmarried; and if he were married, then I suppose I should grumble\nbecause I did not see so much of him. He would be more settled if he\nwould marry, I think. For myself I approve of early marriages for\nyoung men.\" And then she thought of her own husband whom she had\nloved so well and lost so soon. And so they sat silent for a while,\neach thinking of her own lot in life.\n\n\"But I must not keep you up all night,\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"Oh, I do so like you to be here,\" said the other. Then again she\ntook hold of her arm, and the two women kissed each other.\n\n\"But, Edith,\" said the other, \"I came in here to-night with a\npurpose. I have something that I wish to say to you. Can you listen\nto me?\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Mrs. Orme; \"surely.\"\n\n\"Has your son been talking to you about--about what was said between\nhim and me the other day? I am sure he has, for I know he tells you\neverything,--as he ought to do.\"\n\n\"Yes, he did speak to me,\" said Mrs. Orme, almost trembling with\nanxiety.\n\n\"I am so glad, for now it will be easier for me to tell you. And\nsince that I have seen Mr. Furnival, and he says the same. I tell you\nbecause you are so good and so loving to me. I will keep nothing from\nyou; but you must not tell Sir Peregrine that I talked to Mr.\nFurnival about this.\"\n\nMrs. Orme gave the required promise, hardly thinking at the moment\nwhether or no she would be guilty of any treason against Sir\nPeregrine in doing so.\n\n\"I think I should have said nothing to him, though he is so very old\na friend, had not Mr. Orme--\"\n\n\"You mean Peregrine?\"\n\n\"Yes; had not he been so--so earnest about it. He told me that if I\nmarried Sir Peregrine I should be doing a cruel injury to him--to his\ngrandfather.\"\n\n\"He should not have said that.\"\n\n\"Yes, Edith,--if he thinks it. He told me that I should be turning\nall his friends against him. So I promised him that I would speak to\nSir Peregrine, and break it off if it be possible.\"\n\n\"He told me that.\"\n\n\"And then I spoke to Mr. Furnival, and he told me that I should be\nblamed by all the world if I were to marry him. I cannot tell you all\nhe said, but he said this: that if--if--\"\n\n\"If what, dear?\"\n\n\"If in the court they should say--\"\n\n\"Say what?\"\n\n\"Say that I did this thing,--then Sir Peregrine would be crushed, and\nwould die with a broken heart.\"\n\n\"But they cannot say that;--it is impossible. You do not think it\npossible that they can do so?\" And then again she took hold of Lady\nMason's arm, and looked up anxiously, into her face. She looked up\nanxiously, not suspecting anything, not for a moment presuming it\npossible that such a verdict could be justly given, but in order that\nshe might see how far the fear of a fate so horrible was operating on\nher friend. Lady Mason's face was pale and woe-worn, but not more so\nthan was now customary with her.\n\n\"One cannot say what may be possible,\" she answered slowly. \"I\nsuppose they would not go on with it if they did not think they had\nsome chance of success.\"\n\n\"You mean as to the property?\"\n\n\"Yes; as to the property.\"\n\n\"But why should they not try that, if they must try it, without\ndragging you there?\"\n\n\"Ah, I do not understand; or at least I cannot explain it. Mr.\nFurnival says that it must be so; and therefore I shall tell Sir\nPeregrine to-morrow that all this must be given up.\" And then they\nsat together silently, holding each other by the hand.\n\n\"Good night, Edith,\" Lady Mason said at last, getting up from her\nseat.\n\n\"Good night, dearest.\"\n\n\"You will let me be your friend still, will you not?\" said Lady\nMason.\n\n\"My friend! Oh yes; always my friend. Why should this interfere\nbetween you and me?\"\n\n\"But he will be very angry--at least I fear that he will. Not\nthat--not that he will have anything to regret. But the very strength\nof his generosity and nobleness will make him angry. He will be\nindignant because I do not let him make this sacrifice for me. And\nthen--and then--I fear I must leave this house.\"\n\n\"Oh no, not that; I will speak to him. He will do anything for me.\"\n\n\"It will be better perhaps that I should go. People will think that I\nam estranged from Lucius. But if I go, you will come to me? He will\nlet you do that; will he not?\"\n\nAnd then there were warm, close promises given, and embraces\ninterchanged. The women did love each other with a hearty, true\nlove, and each longed that they might be left together. And yet how\ndifferent they were, and how different had been their lives!\n\nThe prominent thought in Lady Mason's mind as she returned to her own\nroom was this:--that Mrs. Orme had said no word to dissuade her from\nthe line of conduct which she had proposed to herself. Mrs. Orme\nhad never spoken against the marriage as Peregrine had spoken, and\nMr. Furnival. Her heart had not been stern enough to allow her to\ndo that. But was it not clear that her opinion was the same as\ntheirs? Lady Mason acknowledged to herself that it was clear, and\nacknowledged to herself also that no one was in favour of the\nmarriage. \"I will do it immediately after breakfast,\" she said to\nherself. And then she sat down,--and sat through the half the night\nthinking of it.\n\nMrs. Orme, when she was left alone, almost rebuked herself in that\nshe had said no word of counsel against the undertaking which Lady\nMason proposed for herself. For Mr. Furnival and his opinion she did\nnot care much. Indeed, she would have been angry with Lady Mason\nfor speaking to Mr. Furnival on the subject, were it not that her\npity was too deep to admit of any anger. That the truth must be\nestablished at the trial Mrs. Orme felt all but confident. When alone\nshe would feel quite sure on this point, though a doubt would always\ncreep in on her when Lady Mason was with her. But now, as she sat\nalone, she could not realise the idea that the fear of a verdict\nagainst her friend should offer any valid reason against the\nmarriage. The valid reasons, if there were such, must be looked for\nelsewhere. And were these other reasons so strong in their validity?\nSir Peregrine desired the marriage; and so did Lady Mason herself, as\nregarded her own individual wishes. Mrs. Orme was sure that this was\nso. And then for her own self, she,--Sir Peregrine's daughter-in-law,\nthe only lady concerned in the matter,--she also would have liked it.\nBut her son disliked it, and she had yielded so far to the wishes of\nher son. Well; was it not right that with her those wishes should be\nall but paramount? And thus she endeavoured to satisfy her conscience\nas she retired to rest.\n\nOn the following morning the four assembled at breakfast. Lady Mason\nhardly spoke at all to any one. Mrs. Orme, who knew what was about to\ntake place, was almost as silent; but Sir Peregrine had almost more\nto say than usual to his grandson. He was in good spirits, having\nfirmly made up his mind on a certain point; and he showed this by\ntelling Peregrine that he would ride with him immediately after\nbreakfast. \"What has made you so slack about your hunting during the\nlast two or three days?\" he asked.\n\n\"I shall hunt to-morrow,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"Then you can afford time to ride with me through the woods after\nbreakfast.\" And so it would have been arranged had not Lady Mason\nimmediately said that she hoped to be able to say a few words to Sir\nPeregrine in the library after breakfast. \"_Place aux dames_,\" said\nhe. \"Peregrine, the horses can wait.\" And so the matter was arranged\nwhile they were still sitting over their toast.\n\nPeregrine, as this was said, had looked at his mother, but she had\nnot ventured to take her eyes for a moment from the teapot. Then he\nhad looked at Lady Mason, and saw that she was, as it were, going\nthrough a fashion of eating her breakfast. In order to break the\nabsolute silence of the room he muttered something about the weather,\nand then his grandfather, with the same object, answered him. After\nthat no words were spoken till Sir Peregrine, rising from his chair,\ndeclared that he was ready.\n\nHe got up and opened the door for his guest, and then hurrying across\nthe hall, opened the library door for her also, holding it till she\nhad passed in. Then he took her left hand in his, and passing his\nright arm round her waist, asked her if anything disturbed her.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she said, \"yes; there is much that disturbs me. I have done\nvery wrong.\"\n\n\"How done wrong, Mary?\" She could not recollect that he had called\nher Mary before, and the sound she thought was very sweet;--was very\nsweet, although she was over forty, and he over seventy years of age.\n\n\"I have done very wrong, and I have now come here that I may undo it.\nDear Sir Peregrine, you must not be angry with me.\"\n\n\"I do not think that I shall be angry with you; but what is it,\ndearest?\"\n\nBut she did not know how to find words to declare her purpose. It was\ncomparatively an easy task to tell Mrs. Orme that she had made up\nher mind not to marry Sir Peregrine, but it was by no means easy to\ntell the baronet himself. And now she stood there leaning over the\nfireplace, with his arm round her waist,--as it behoved her to stand\nno longer, seeing the resolution to which she had come. But still she\ndid not speak.\n\n\"Well, Mary, what is it? I know there is something on your mind or\nyou would not have summoned me in here. Is it about the trial? Have\nyou seen Mr. Furnival again?\"\n\n\"No; it is not about the trial,\" she said, avoiding the other\nquestion.\n\n\"What is it then?\"\n\n\"Sir Peregrine, it is impossible that we should be married.\" And thus\nshe brought forth her tidings, as it were at a gasp, speaking at the\nmoment with a voice that was almost indicative of anger.\n\n\"And why not?\" said he, releasing her from his arm and looking at\nher.\n\n\"It cannot be,\" she said.\n\n\"And why not, Lady Mason?\"\n\n\"It cannot be,\" she said again, speaking with more emphasis, and with\na stronger tone.\n\n\"And is that all that you intend to tell me? Have I done anything\nthat has offended you?\"\n\n\"Offended me! No. I do not think that would be possible. The offence\nis on the other side--\"\n\n\"Then, my dear,--\"\n\n\"But listen to me now. It cannot be. I know that it is wrong.\nEverything tells me that such a marriage on your part would be a\nsacrifice,--a terrible sacrifice. You would be throwing away your\ngreat rank--\"\n\n\"No,\" shouted Sir Peregrine; \"not though I married a\nkitchen-maid,--instead of a lady who in social life is my equal.\"\n\n\"Ah, no; I should not have said rank. You cannot lose that;--but your\nstation in the world, the respect of all around you, the--the--the--\"\n\n\"Who has been telling you all this?\"\n\n\"I have wanted no one to tell me. Thinking of it has told it me all.\nMy own heart which is full of gratitude and love for you has told\nme.\"\n\n\"You have not seen Lord Alston?\"\n\n\"Lord Alston! oh, no.\"\n\n\"Has Peregrine been speaking to you?\"\n\n\"Peregrine!\"\n\n\"Yes; Peregrine; my grandson?\"\n\n\"He has spoken to me.\"\n\n\"Telling you to say this to me. Then he is an ungrateful boy;--a very\nungrateful boy. I would have done anything to guard him from wrong in\nthis matter.\"\n\n\"Ah; now I see the evil that I have done. Why did I ever come into\nthe house to make quarrels between you?\"\n\n\"There shall be no quarrel. I will forgive him even that if you will\nbe guided by me. And, dearest Mary, you must be guided by me now.\nThis matter has gone too far for you to go back--unless, indeed, you\nwill say that personally you have an aversion to the marriage.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; no; it is not that,\" she said eagerly. She could not help\nsaying it with eagerness. She could not inflict the wound on his\nfeelings which her silence would then have given.\n\n\"Under those circumstances, I have a right to say that the marriage\nmust go on.\"\n\n\"No; no.\"\n\n\"But I say it must. Sit down, Mary.\" And she did sit down, while he\nstood leaning over her and thus spoke. \"You speak of sacrificing\nme. I am an old man with not many more years before me. If I did\nsacrifice what little is left to me of life with the object of\nbefriending one whom I really love, there would be no more in it than\nwhat a man might do, and still feel that the balance was on the right\nside. But here there will be no sacrifice. My life will be happier,\nand so will Edith's. And so indeed will that boy's, if he did but\nknow it. For the world's talk, which will last some month or two, I\ncare nothing. This I will confess, that if I were prompted to this\nonly by my own inclination, only by love for you--\" and as he spoke\nhe held out his hand to her, and she could not refuse him hers--\"in\nsuch a case I should doubt and hesitate and probably keep aloof from\nsuch a step. But it is not so. In doing this I shall gratify my own\nheart, and also serve you in your great troubles. Believe me, I have\nthought of that.\"\n\n\"I know you have, Sir Peregrine,--and therefore it cannot be.\"\n\n\"But therefore it shall be. The world knows it now; and were we to\nbe separated after what has past, the world would say that I--I had\nthought you guilty of this crime.\"\n\n\"I must bear all that.\" And now she stood before him, not looking him\nin the face, but with her face turned down towards the ground, and\nspeaking hardly above her breath.\n\n\"By heavens, no; not whilst I can stand by your side. Not whilst I\nhave strength left to support you and thrust the lie down the throat\nof such a wretch as Joseph Mason. No, Mary, go back to Edith and tell\nher that you have tried it, but that there is no escape for you.\" And\nthen he smiled at her. His smile at times could be very pleasant!\n\nBut she did not smile as she answered him. \"Sir Peregrine,\" she said;\nand she endeavoured to raise her face to his but failed.\n\n\"Well, my love.\"\n\n\"Sir Peregrine, I am guilty.\"\n\n\"Guilty! Guilty of what?\" he said, startled rather than instructed by\nher words.\n\n\"Guilty of all this with which they charge me.\" And then she threw\nherself at his feet, and wound her arms round his knees.\n\n[Illustration: Guilty.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\nSHOWING HOW MRS. ORME COULD BE VERY WEAK MINDED.\n\n\nI venture to think, I may almost say to hope, that Lady Mason's\nconfession at the end of the last chapter will not have taken anybody\nby surprise. If such surprise be felt I must have told my tale badly.\nI do not like such revulsions of feeling with regard to my characters\nas surprises of this nature must generate. That Lady Mason had\ncommitted the terrible deed for which she was about to be tried, that\nMr. Furnival's suspicion of her guilt was only too well founded, that\nMr. Dockwrath with his wicked ingenuity had discovered no more than\nthe truth, will, in its open revelation, have caused no surprise to\nthe reader;--but it did cause terrible surprise to Sir Peregrine\nOrme.\n\nAnd now we must go back a little and endeavour to explain how it was\nthat Lady Mason had made this avowal of her guilt. That she had not\nintended to do so when she entered Sir Peregrine's library is very\ncertain. Had such been her purpose she would not have asked Mrs. Orme\nto visit her at Orley Farm. Had such a course of events been in her\nmind she would not have spoken of her departure from The Cleeve as\ndoubtful. No. She had intended still to keep her terrible secret to\nherself; still to have leaned upon Sir Peregrine's arm as on the arm\nof a trusting friend. But he had overcome her by his generosity; and\nin her fixed resolve that he should not be dragged down into this\nabyss of misery the sudden determination to tell the truth at least\nto him had come upon her. She did tell him all; and then, as soon as\nthe words were out of her mouth, the strength which had enabled her\nto do so deserted her, and she fell at his feet overcome by weakness\nof body as well as spirit.\n\nBut the words which she spoke did not at first convey to his mind\ntheir full meaning. Though she had twice repeated the assertion\nthat she was guilty, the fact of her guilt did not come home to his\nunderstanding as a thing that he could credit. There was something,\nhe doubted not, to surprise and harass him,--something which when\nrevealed and made clear might, or might not, affect his purpose of\nmarrying,--something which it behoved this woman to tell before she\ncould honestly become his wife, something which was destined to give\nhis heart a blow. But he was very far as yet from understanding the\nwhole truth. Let us think of those we love best, and ask ourselves\nhow much it would take to convince us of their guilt in such a\nmatter. That thrusting of the lie down the throat of Joseph Mason had\nbecome to him so earnest a duty, that the task of believing the lie\nto be on the other side was no easy one. The blow which he had to\nsuffer was a cruel blow. Lady Mason, however, was merciful, for she\nmight have enhanced the cruelty tenfold.\n\nHe stood there wondering and bewildered for some minutes of time,\nwhile she, with her face hidden, still clung round his knees. \"What\nis it?\" at last he said. \"I do not understand.\" But she had no answer\nto make to him. Her great resolve had been quickly made and quickly\ncarried out, but now the reaction left her powerless. He stooped down\nto raise her; but when he moved she fell prone upon the ground; he\ncould hear her sobs as though her bosom would burst with them.\n\nAnd then by degrees the meaning of her words began to break upon him.\n\"I am guilty of all this with which they charge me.\" Could that be\npossible? Could it be that she had forged that will; that with base,\npremeditated contrivance she had stolen that property; stolen it and\nkept it from that day to this;--through all these long years? And\nthen he thought of her pure life, of her womanly, dignified repose,\nof her devotion to her son,--such devotion indeed!--of her sweet pale\nface and soft voice! He thought of all this, and of his own love and\nfriendship for her,--of Edith's love for her! He thought of it all,\nand he could not believe that she was guilty. There was some other\nfault, some much lesser fault than that, with which she charged\nherself. But there she lay at his feet, and it was necessary that he\nshould do something towards lifting her to a seat.\n\nHe stooped and took her by the hand, but his feeble strength was not\nsufficient to raise her. \"Lady Mason,\" he said, \"speak to me. I do\nnot understand you. Will you not let me seat you on the sofa?\"\n\nBut she, at least, had realised the full force of the revelation she\nhad made, and lay there covered with shame, broken-hearted, and\nunable to raise her eyes from the ground. With what inward struggles\nshe had played her part during the last few months, no one might ever\nknow! But those struggles had been kept to herself. The world, her\nworld, that world for which she had cared, in which she had lived,\nhad treated her with honour and respect, and had looked upon her as\nan ill-used innocent woman. But now all that would be over. Every one\nnow must know what she was. And then, as she lay there, that thought\ncame to her. Must every one know it? Was there no longer any hope\nfor her? Must Lucius be told? She could bear all the rest, if only\nhe might be ignorant of his mother's disgrace;--he, for whom all\nhad been done! But no. He, and every one must know it. Oh! if the\nbeneficent Spirit that sees all and pities all would but take her\nthat moment from the world!\n\nWhen Sir Peregrine asked her whether he should seat her on the sofa,\nshe slowly picked herself up, and with her head still crouching\ntowards the ground, placed herself where she before had been sitting.\nHe had been afraid that she would have fainted, but she was not one\nof those women whose nature easily admits of such relief as that.\nThough she was always pale in colour and frail looking, there was\nwithin her a great power of self-sustenance. She was a woman who with\na good cause might have dared anything. With the worst cause that a\nwoman could well have, she had dared and endured very much. She did\nnot faint, nor gasp as though she were choking, nor become hysteric\nin her agony; but she lay there, huddled up in the corner of the\nsofa, with her face hidden, and all those feminine graces forgotten\nwhich had long stood her in truth so royally. The inner, true, living\nwoman was there at last,--that and nothing else.\n\nBut he,--what was he to do? It went against his heart to harass her\nat that moment; but then it was essential that he should know the\ntruth. The truth, or a suspicion of the truth was now breaking upon\nhim; and if that suspicion should be confirmed, what was he to do?\nIt was at any rate necessary that everything should be put beyond a\ndoubt.\n\n\"Lady Mason,\" he said, \"if you are able to speak to me--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, gradually straightening herself, and raising her\nhead though she did not look at him. \"Yes. I am able.\" But there was\nsomething terrible in the sound of her voice. It was such a sound of\nagony that he felt himself unable to persist.\n\n\"If you wish it I will leave you, and come back,--say in an hour.\"\n\n\"No, no; do not leave me.\" And her whole body was shaken with a\ntremour, as though of an ague fit. \"Do not go away, and I will tell\nyou everything. I did it.\"\n\n\"Did what?\"\n\n\"I--forged the will. I did it all.--I am guilty.\"\n\nThere was the whole truth now, declared openly and in the most simple\nwords, and there was no longer any possibility that he should doubt.\nIt was very terrible,--a terrible tragedy. But to him at this present\nmoment the part most frightful was his and her present position. What\nshould he do for her? How should he counsel her? In what way so act\nthat he might best assist her without compromising that high sense\nof right and wrong which in him was a second nature. He felt at\nthe moment that he would still give his last shilling to rescue\nher,--only that there was the property! Let the heavens fall, justice\nmust be done there. Even a wretch such as Joseph Mason must have that\nwhich was clearly his own.\n\nAs she spoke those last words, she had risen from the sofa, and was\nnow standing before him resting with her hands upon the table, like a\nprisoner in the dock.\n\n\"What!\" he said; \"with your own hands?\"\n\n\"Yes; with my own hands. When he would not do justice to my baby,\nwhen he talked of that other being the head of his house, I did it,\nwith my own hands,--during the night.\"\n\n\"And you wrote the names,--yourself?\"\n\n\"Yes; I wrote them all.\" And then there was again silence in the\nroom; but she still stood, leaning on the table, waiting for him to\nspeak her doom.\n\nHe turned away from the spot in which he had confronted her and\nwalked to the window. What was he to do? How was he to help her? And\nhow was he to be rid of her? How was he to save his daughter from\nfurther contact with a woman such as this? And how was he to bid his\ndaughter behave to this woman as one woman should behave to another\nin her misery? Then too he had learned to love her himself,--had\nyearned to call her his own; and though this in truth was a minor\nsorrow, it was one which at the moment added bitterness to the\nothers. But there she stood, still waiting her doom, and it was\nnecessary that that doom should be spoken by him.\n\n\"If this can really be true--\"\n\n\"It is true. You do not think that a woman would falsely tell such a\ntale as that against herself!\"\n\n\"Then I fear--that this must be over between you and me.\"\n\nThere was a relief to her, a sort of relief, in those words. The doom\nas so far spoken was so much a matter of course that it conveyed no\npenalty. Her story had been told in order that that result might be\nattained with certainty. There was almost a tone of scorn in her\nvoice as she said, \"Oh yes; all that must be over.\"\n\n\"And what next would you have me do?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have nothing to request,\" she said. \"If you must tell it to all\nthe world, do so.\"\n\n\"Tell it; no. It will not be my business to be an informer.\"\n\n\"But you must tell it. There is Mrs. Orme.\"\n\n\"Yes: to Edith!\"\n\n\"And I must leave the house. Oh, where shall I go when he knows it?\nAnd where will he go?\" Wretched miserable woman, but yet so worthy\nof pity! What a terrible retribution for that night's work was now\ncoming on her!\n\nHe again walked to the window to think how he might answer these\nquestions. Must he tell his daughter? Must he banish this criminal\nat once from his house? Every one now had been told of his intended\nmarriage; every one had been told through Lord Alston, Mr. Furnival,\nand such as they. That at any rate must now be untold. And would it\nbe possible that she should remain there, living with them at The\nCleeve, while all this was being done? In truth he did not know how\nto speak. He had not hardness of heart to pronounce her doom.\n\n\"Of course I shall leave the house,\" she said, with something almost\nof pride in her voice. \"If there be no place open to me but a gaol I\nwill do that. Perhaps I had better go now and get my things removed\nat once. Say a word of love for me to her;--a word of respectful\nlove.\" And she moved as though she were going to the door.\n\nBut he would not permit her to leave him thus. He could not let the\npoor, crushed, broken creature wander forth in her agony to bruise\nherself at every turn, and to be alone in her despair. She was still\nthe woman whom he had loved; and, over and beyond that, was she not\nthe woman who had saved him from a terrible downfall by rushing\nherself into utter ruin for his sake? He must take some steps in her\nbehalf--if he could only resolve what those steps should be. She was\nmoving to the door, but stopping her, he took her by the hand. \"You\ndid it,\" he said, \"and he, your husband, knew nothing of it?\" The\nfact itself was so wonderful, that he had hardly as yet made even\nthat all his own.\n\n\"I did it, and he knew nothing of it. I will go now, Sir Peregrine; I\nam strong enough.\"\n\n\"But where will you go?\"\n\n\"Ah me, where shall I go?\" And she put the hand which was at liberty\nup to her temple, brushing back her hair as though she might thus\ncollect her thoughts. \"Where shall I go? But he does not know it yet.\nI will go now to Orley Farm. When must he be told? Tell me that. When\nmust he know it?\"\n\n\"No, Lady Mason; you cannot go there to-day. It's very hard to say\nwhat you had better do.\"\n\n\"Very hard,\" she echoed, shaking her head.\n\n\"But you must remain here at present;--at The Cleeve I mean; at any\nrate for to-day. I will think about it. I will endeavour to think\nwhat may be the best.\"\n\n\"But--we cannot meet now. She and I;--Mrs. Orme?\" And then again\nhe was silent; for in truth the difficulties were too many for him.\nMight it not be best that she should counterfeit illness and be\nconfined to her own room? But then he was averse to recommend any\ncounterfeit; and if Mrs. Orme did not go to her in her assumed\nillness, the counterfeit would utterly fail of effect in the\nhousehold. And then, should he tell Mrs. Orme? The weight of these\ntidings would be too much for him, if he did not share them with some\none. So he made up his mind that he must tell them to her--though to\nno other one.\n\n\"I must tell her,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" she replied; and he felt her hand tremble in his, and\ndropped it. He had forgotten that he thus held her as all these\nthoughts pressed upon his brain.\n\n\"I will tell it to her, but to no one else. If I might advise you, I\nwould say that it will be well for you now to take some rest. You are\nagitated, and--\"\n\n\"Agitated! yes. But you are right, Sir Peregrine. I will go at once\nto my room. And then--\"\n\n\"Then, perhaps,--in the course of the morning, you will see me\nagain.\"\n\n\"Where?--will you come to me there?\"\n\n\"I will see you in her room, in her dressing-room. She will be down\nstairs, you know.\" From which last words the tidings were conveyed to\nLady Mason that she was not to see Mrs. Orme again.\n\nAnd then she went, and as she slowly made her way across the hall\nshe felt that all of evil, all of punishment that she had ever\nanticipated, had now fallen upon her. There are periods in the lives\nof some of us--I trust but of few--when, with the silent inner voice\nof suffering, we call on the mountains to fall and crush us, and\non the earth to gape open and take us in. When, with an agony of\nintensity, we wish that our mothers had been barren. In those moments\nthe poorest and most desolate are objects to us of envy, for their\nsufferings can be as nothing to our own. Lady Mason, as she crept\nsilently across the hall, saw a servant girl pass down towards the\nentrance to the kitchen, and would have given all, all that she had\nin the world, to have changed places with that girl. But no change\nwas possible for her. Neither would the mountains crush her, nor\nwould the earth take her in. There was her burden, and she must bear\nit to the end. There was the bed which she had made for herself, and\nshe must lie upon it. No escape was possible to her. She had herself\nmixed the cup, and she must now drink of it to the dregs.\n\nSlowly and very silently she made her way up to her own room, and\nhaving closed the door behind her sat herself down upon the bed. It\nwas as yet early in the morning, and the servant had not been in the\nchamber. There was no fire there although it was still mid-winter.\nOf such details as these Sir Peregrine had remembered nothing when\nhe recommended her to go to her own room. Nor did she think of them\nat first as she placed herself on the bed-side. But soon the bitter\nair pierced her through and through, and she shivered with the cold\nas she sat there. After a while she got herself a shawl, wrapped it\nclose around her, and then sat down again. She bethought herself that\nshe might have to remain in this way for hours, so she rose again\nand locked the door. It would add greatly to her immediate misery\nif the servants were to come while she was there, and see her in\nher wretchedness. Presently the girls did come, and being unable to\nobtain entrance were told by Lady Mason that she wanted the chamber\nfor the present. Whereupon they offered to light the fire, but she\ndeclared that she was not cold. Her teeth were shaking in her head,\nbut any suffering was better than the suffering of being seen.\n\n[Illustration: Lady Mason after her Confession.]\n\nShe did not lie down, or cover herself further than she was covered\nwith that shawl, nor did she move from her place for more than an\nhour. By degrees she became used to the cold. She was numbed, and\nas it were, half dead in all her limbs, but she had ceased to shake\nas she sat there, and her mind had gone back to the misery of her\nposition. There was so much for her behind that was worse! What\nshould she do when even this retirement should not be allowed to her?\nInstead of longing for the time when she should be summoned to meet\nSir Peregrine, she dreaded its coming. It would bring her nearer to\nthat other meeting when she would have to bow her head and crouch\nbefore her son.\n\nShe had been there above an hour and was in truth ill with the cold\nwhen she heard,--and scarcely heard,--a light step come quickly along\nthe passage towards her door. Her woman's ear instantly told her who\nowned that step, and her heart once more rose with hope. Was she\ncoming there to comfort her, to speak to the poor bruised sinner one\nword of feminine sympathy? The quick light step stopped at the door,\nthere was a pause, and then a low, low knock was heard. Lady Mason\nasked no question, but dropping from the bed hurried to the door and\nturned the key. She turned the key, and as the door was opened half\nhid herself behind it;--and then Mrs. Orme was in the room.\n\n\"What! you have no fire?\" she said, feeling that the air struck her\nwith a sudden chill. \"Oh, this is dreadful! My poor, poor dear!\" And\nthen she took hold of both Lady Mason's hands. Had she possessed the\nwisdom of the serpent as well as the innocence of the dove she could\nnot have been wiser in her first mode of addressing the sufferer. For\nshe knew it all. During that dreadful hour Sir Peregrine had told\nher the whole story; and very dreadful that hour had been to her. He,\nwhen he attempted to give counsel in the matter, had utterly failed.\nHe had not known what to suggest, nor could she say what it might\nbe wisest for them all to do; but on one point her mind had been at\nonce resolved. The woman who had once been her friend, whom she had\nlearned to love, should not leave the house without some sympathy\nand womanly care. The guilt was very bad; yes, it was terrible;\nshe acknowledged that it was a thing to be thought of only with\nshuddering. But the guilt of twenty years ago did not strike her\nsenses so vividly as the abject misery of the present day. There was\nno pity in her bosom for Mr. Joseph Mason when she heard the story,\nbut she was full of pity for her who had committed the crime. It was\ntwenty years ago, and had not the sinner repented? Besides, was she\nto be the judge? \"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged,\" she said,\nwhen she thought that Sir Peregrine spoke somewhat harshly in the\nmatter. So she said, altogether misinterpreting the Scripture in her\ndesire to say something in favour of the poor woman.\n\nBut when it was hinted to her that Lady Mason might return to Orley\nFarm without being again seen by her, her woman's heart at once\nrebelled. \"If she has done wrong,\" said Mrs. Orme--\n\n\"She has done great wrong--fearful wrong,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"It will not hurt me to see her because she has done wrong. Not see\nher while she is in the house! If she were in the prison, would I not\ngo to see her?\" And then Sir Peregrine had said no more, but he loved\nhis daughter-in-law all the better for her unwonted vehemence.\n\n\"You will do what is right,\" he said--\"as you always do.\" Then he\nleft her; and she, after standing for a few moments while she shaped\nher thoughts, went straight away to Lady Mason's room.\n\nShe took Lady Mason by both her hands and found that they were icy\ncold. \"Oh, this is dreadful,\" she said. \"Come with me, dear.\" But\nLady Mason still stood, up by the bed-head, whither she had retreated\nfrom the door. Her eyes were still cast upon the ground and she\nleaned back as Mrs. Orme held her, as though by her weight she would\nhinder her friend from leading her from the room.\n\n\"You are frightfully cold,\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Has he told you?\" said Lady Mason, asking the question in the lowest\npossible whisper, and still holding back as she spoke.\n\n\"Yes; he has told me;--but no one else--no one else.\" And then for a\nfew moments nothing was spoken between them.\n\n\"Oh, that I could die!\" said the poor wretch, expressing in words\nthat terrible wish that the mountains might fall upon her and crush\nher.\n\n\"You must not say that. That would be wicked, you know. He can\ncomfort you. Do you not know that He will comfort you, if you are\nsorry for your sins and go to Him?\"\n\nBut the woman in her intense suffering could not acknowledge to\nherself any idea of comfort. \"Ah, me!\" she exclaimed, with a deep\nbursting sob which went straight to Mrs. Orme's heart. And then a\nconvulsive fit of trembling seized her so strongly that Mrs. Orme\ncould hardly continue to hold her hands.\n\n\"You are ill with the cold,\" she said. \"Come with me, Lady Mason, you\nshall not stay here longer.\"\n\nLady Mason then permitted herself to be led out of the room, and the\ntwo went quickly down the passage to the head of the front stairs,\nand from thence to Mrs. Orme's room. In crossing the house they had\nseen no one and been seen by no one; and Lady Mason when she came to\nthe door hurried in, that she might again hide herself in security\nfor the moment. As soon as the door was closed Mrs. Orme placed her\nin an arm-chair which she wheeled up to the front of the fire, and\nseating herself on a stool at the poor sinner's feet, chafed her\nhands within her own. She took away the shawl and made her stretch\nout her feet towards the fire, and thus seated close to her, she\nspoke no word for the next half-hour as to the terrible fact that\nhad become known to her. Then, on a sudden, as though the ice of her\nheart had thawed from the warmth of the other's kindness, Lady Mason\nburst into a flood of tears, and flinging herself upon her friend's\nneck and bosom begged with earnest piteousness to be forgiven.\n\nAnd Mrs. Orme did forgive her. Many will think that she was wrong to\ndo so, and I fear it must be acknowledged that she was not strong\nminded. By forgiving her I do not mean that she pronounced absolution\nfor the sin of past years, or that she endeavoured to make the\nsinner think that she was no worse for her sin. Mrs. Orme was a good\nchurchwoman but not strong, individually, in points of doctrine. All\nthat she left mainly to the woman's conscience and her own dealings\nwith her Saviour,--merely saying a word of salutary counsel as to a\ncertain spiritual pastor who might be of aid. But Mrs. Orme forgave\nher,--as regarded herself. She had already, while all this was\nunknown, taken this woman to her heart as pure and good. It now\nappeared that the woman had not been pure, had not been good!--And\nthen she took her to her heart again! Criminal as the woman was,\ndisgraced and debased, subject almost to the heaviest penalties of\noutraged law and justice, a felon against whom the actual hands of\nthe law's myrmidons would probably soon prevail, a creature doomed to\nbear the scorn of the lowest of her fellow-creatures,--such as she\nwas, this other woman, pure and high, so shielded from the world's\nimpurity that nothing ignoble might touch her,--this lady took her\nto her heart again and promised in her ear with low sweet words of\nconsolation that they should still be friends. I cannot say that Mrs.\nOrme was right. That she was weak minded I feel nearly certain. But,\nperhaps, this weakness of mind may never be brought against her to\nher injury, either in this world or in the next.\n\nI will not pretend to give the words which passed between them at\nthat interview. After a while Lady Mason allowed herself to be guided\nall in all by her friend's advice as though she herself had been a\nchild. It was decided that for the present,--that is for the next day\nor two,--Lady Mason should keep her room at The Cleeve as an invalid.\nCounterfeit in this there would be none certainly, for indeed she was\nhardly fit for any place but her own bed. If inclined and able to\nleave her room, she should be made welcome to the use of Mrs. Orme's\ndressing-room. It would only be necessary to warn Peregrine that for\nthe present he must abstain from coming there. The servants, Mrs.\nOrme said, had heard of their master's intended marriage. They would\nnow hear that this intention had been abandoned. On this they would\nput their own construction, and would account in their own fashion\nfor the fact that Sir Peregrine and his guest no longer saw each\nother. But no suspicion of the truth would get abroad when it was\nseen that Lady Mason was still treated as a guest at The Cleeve. As\nto such future steps as might be necessary to be taken, Mrs. Orme\nwould consult with Sir Peregrine, and tell Lady Mason from time to\ntime. And as for the sad truth, the terrible truth,--that, at any\nrate for the present, should be told to no other ears. And so the\nwhole morning was spent, and Mrs. Orme saw neither Sir Peregrine nor\nher son till she went down to the library in the first gloom of the\nwinter evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nA WOMAN'S IDEA OF FRIENDSHIP.\n\n\nSir Peregrine after the hour that he had spent with his\ndaughter-in-law,--that terrible hour during which Lady Mason had sat\nalone on the bed-side,--returned to the library and remained there\nduring the whole of the afternoon. It may be remembered that he had\nagreed to ride through the woods with his grandson; but that purpose\nhad been abandoned early in the day, and Peregrine had in consequence\nbeen hanging about the house. He soon perceived that something was\namiss, but he did not know what. He had looked for his mother, and\nhad indeed seen her for a moment at her door; but she had told him\nthat she could not then speak to him. Sir Peregrine also had shut\nhimself up, but about the hour of dusk he sent for his grandson; and\nwhen Mrs. Orme, on leaving Lady Mason, went down to the library, she\nfound them both together.\n\nThey were standing with their backs to the fire, and the gloom in the\nroom was too dark to allow of their faces being seen, but she felt\nthat the conversation between them was of a serious nature. Indeed\nwhat conversation in that house could be other than serious on\nthat day? \"I see that I am disturbing you,\" she said, preparing to\nretreat. \"I did not know that you were together.\"\n\n\"Do not go, Edith,\" said the old man. \"Peregrine, put a chair for\nyour mother. I have told him that all this is over now between me and\nLady Mason.\"\n\nShe trembled as she heard the words, for it seemed to her that there\nmust be danger now in even speaking of Lady Mason,--danger with\nreference to that dreadful secret, the divulging of which would be so\nfatal.\n\n\"I have told him,\" continued Sir Peregrine, \"that for a few minutes I\nwas angry with him when I heard from Lady Mason that he had spoken to\nher; but I believe that on the whole it is better that it should have\nbeen so.\"\n\n\"He would be very unhappy if anything that he had done had distressed\nyou,\" said Mrs. Orme, hardly knowing what words to use, or how to\nspeak. Nor did she feel quite certain as yet how much had been told\nto her son, and how much was concealed from him.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" said the old man, laying his arm affectionately on the\nyoung man's shoulder. \"He has done nothing to distress me. There is\nnothing wrong--nothing wrong between him and me. Thank God for that.\nBut, Perry, we will think now of that other matter. Have you told\nyour mother anything about it?\" And he strove to look away from the\nwretchedness of his morning's work to something in his family that\nstill admitted of a bright hope.\n\n\"No, sir; not yet. We won't mind that just now.\" And then they all\nremained silent, Mrs. Orme sitting, and the two men still standing\nwith their backs towards the fire. Her mind was too intent on the\nunfortunate lady up stairs to admit of her feeling interest in that\nother unknown matter to which Sir Peregrine had alluded.\n\n\"If you have done with Perry,\" she said at last, \"I would be glad to\nspeak to you for a minute or two.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Peregrine;--\"we have done.\" And then he went.\n\n\"You have told him,\" said she, as soon as they were left together.\n\n\"Told him; what, of her? Oh no. I have told him that that,--that\nidea of mine has been abandoned.\" From this time forth Sir Peregrine\ncould never endure to speak of his proposed marriage, nor to hear it\nspoken of. \"He conceives that this has been done at her instance,\" he\ncontinued.\n\n\"And so it has,\" said Mrs. Orme, with much more of decision in her\nvoice than was customary with her.\n\n\"And so it has,\" he repeated after her.\n\n\"Nobody must know of this,\"--said she very solemnly, standing up and\nlooking into his face with eager eyes. \"Nobody but you and I.\"\n\n\"All the world, I fear, will know it soon,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"No; no. Why should all the world know it? Had she not told us we\nshould not have known it. We should not have suspected it. Mr.\nFurnival, who understands these things;--he does not think her\nguilty.\"\n\n\"But, Edith--the property!\"\n\n\"Let her give that up--after a while; when all this has passed by.\nThat man is not in want. It will not hurt him to be without it a\nlittle longer. It will be enough for her to do that when this trial\nshall be over.\"\n\n\"But it is not hers. She cannot give it up. It belongs to her\nson,--or is thought to belong to him. It is not for us to be\ninformers, Edith--\"\n\n\"No, no; it is not for us to be informers. We must remember that.\"\n\n\"Certainly. It is not for us to tell the story of her guilt; but her\nguilt will remain the same, will be acted over and over again every\nday, while the proceeds of the property go into the hands of Lucius\nMason. It is that which is so terrible, Edith;--that her conscience\nshould have been able to bear that load for the last twenty years! A\ndeed done,--that admits of no restitution, may admit of repentance.\nWe may leave that to the sinner and his conscience, hoping that he\nstands right with his Maker. But here, with her, there has been a\ncontinual theft going on from year to year,--which is still going\non. While Lucius Mason holds a sod of Orley Farm, true repentance\nwith her must be impossible. It seems so to me.\" And Sir Peregrine\nshuddered at the doom which his own rectitude of mind and purpose\nforced him to pronounce.\n\n\"It is not she that has it,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"It was not done for\nherself.\"\n\n\"There is no difference in that,\" said he sharply. \"All sin\nis selfish, and so was her sin in this. Her object was the\naggrandisement of her own child; and when she could not accomplish\nthat honestly, she did it by fraud, and--and--and--. Edith, my dear,\nyou and I must look at this thing as it is. You must not let your\nkind heart make your eyes blind in a matter of such moment.\"\n\n\"No, father; nor must the truth make our hearts cruel. You talk of\nrestitution and repentance. Repentance is not the work of a day. How\nare we to say by what struggles her poor heart has been torn?\"\n\n\"I do not judge her.\"\n\n\"No, no; that is it. We may not judge her; may we? But we may assist\nher in her wretchedness. I have promised that I will do all I can to\naid her. You will allow me to do so;--you will; will you not?\" And\nshe pressed his arm and looked up into his face, entreating him.\nSince first they two had known each other, he had never yet denied\nher a request. It was a law of his life that he would never do so.\nBut now he hesitated, not thinking that he would refuse her, but\nfeeling that on such an occasion it would be necessary to point out\nto her how far she might go without risk of bringing censure on her\nown name. But in this case, though the mind of Sir Peregrine might\nbe the more logical, the purpose of his daughter-in-law was the\nstronger. She had resolved that such communication with crime would\nnot stain her, and she already knew to what length she would go in\nher charity. Indeed, her mind was fully resolved to go far enough.\n\n\"I hardly know as yet what she intends to do; any assistance that you\ncan give her must, I should say, depend on her own line of conduct.\"\n\n\"But I want your advice as to that. I tell you what I purpose. It is\nclear that Mr. Furnival thinks she will gain the day at this trial.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Furnival does not know the truth.\"\n\n\"Nor will the judge and the lawyers, and all the rest. As you say so\nproperly, it is not for us to be the informers. If they can prove it,\nlet them. But you would not have her tell them all against herself?\"\nAnd then she paused, waiting for his answer.\n\n\"I do not know. I do not know what to say. It is not for me to advise\nher.\"\n\n\"Ah, but it is for you,\" she said; and as she spoke she put her\nlittle hand down on the table with an energy which startled him. \"She\nis here--a wretched woman, in your house. And why do you know the\ntruth? Why has it been told to you and me? Because without telling it\nshe could not turn you from that purpose of yours. It was generous,\nfather--confess that; it was very generous.\"\n\n\"Yes, it was generous,\" said Sir Peregrine.\n\n\"It was very generous. It would be base in us if we allowed ourselves\nto forget that. But I was telling you my plan. She must go to this\ntrial.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; there will be no doubt as to that.\"\n\n\"Then--if she can escape, let the property be given up afterwards.\"\n\n\"I do not see how it is to be arranged. The property will belong to\nLucius, and she cannot give it up then. It is not so easy to put\nmatters right when guilt and fraud have set them wrong.\"\n\n\"We will do the best we can. Even suppose that you were to tell\nLucius afterwards;--you yourself! if that were necessary, you know.\"\n\nAnd so by degrees she talked him over; but yet he would come to no\ndecision as to what steps he himself must take. What if he himself\nshould go to Mr. Round, and pledge himself that the whole estate\nshould be restored to Mr. Mason of Groby, on condition that the trial\nwere abandoned? The world would probably guess the truth after that;\nbut the terrible trial and the more terrible punishment which would\nfollow it might be thus escaped. Poor Sir Peregrine! Even when\nhe argued thus within himself, his conscience told him that in\ntaking such a line of conduct, he himself would be guilty of some\noutrage against the law by aiding a criminal in her escape. He had\nheard of misprision of felony; but nevertheless, he allowed his\ndaughter-in-law to prevail. Before such a step as this could be taken\nthe consent of Lady Mason must of course be obtained; but as to that\nMrs. Orme had no doubt. If Lucius could be induced to abandon the\nproperty without hearing the whole story, it would be well. But if\nthat could not be achieved,--then the whole story must be told to\nhim. \"And you will tell it,\" Mrs. Orme said to him. \"It would be\neasier for me to cut off my right arm,\" he answered; \"but I will do\nmy best.\"\n\nAnd then came the question as to the place of Lady Mason's immediate\nresidence. It was evident to Mrs. Orme that Sir Peregrine expected\nthat she would at once go back to Orley Farm;--not exactly on that\nday, nor did he say on the day following. But his words made it\nvery manifest that he did not think it right that she should under\nexisting circumstances remain at The Cleeve. Sir Peregrine, however,\nas quickly understood that Mrs. Orme did not wish her to go away for\nsome days.\n\n\"It would injure the cause if she were to leave us quite at once,\"\nsaid Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"But how can she stay here, my dear,--with no one to see her; with\nnone but the servants to wait upon her?\"\n\n\"I should see her,\" said Mrs. Orme, boldly.\n\n\"Do you mean constantly--in your old, friendly way?\"\n\n\"Yes, constantly; and,\" she added after a pause, \"not only here, but\nat Orley Farm also.\" And then there was another pause between them.\n\nSir Peregrine certainly was not a cruel man, nor was his heart by any\nmeans hardened against the lady with whom circumstances had lately\njoined him so closely. Indeed, since the knowledge of her guilt had\nfully come upon him, he had undertaken the conduct of her perilous\naffairs in a manner more confidential even than that which had\nexisted while he expected to make her his wife. But, nevertheless,\nit went sorely against the grain with him when it was proposed that\nthere should still exist a close intimacy between the one cherished\nlady of his household and the woman who had been guilty of so base\na crime. It seemed to him that he might touch pitch and not be\ndefiled;--he or any man belonging to him. But he could not reconcile\nit to himself that the widow of his son should run such risk. In\nhis estimation there was something almost more than human about the\npurity of the only woman that blessed his hearth. It seemed to him\nas though she were a sacred thing, to be guarded by a shrine,--to be\nprotected from all contact with the pollutions of the outer world.\nAnd now it was proposed to him that she should take a felon to her\nbosom as her friend!\n\n\"But will that be necessary, Edith?\" he said; \"and after all that has\nbeen revealed to us now, will it be wise?\"\n\n\"I think so,\" she said, speaking again with a very low voice. \"Why,\nshould I not?\"\n\n\"Because she has shown herself unworthy of such friendship;--unfit\nfor it I should say.\"\n\n\"Unworthy! Dear father, is she not as worthy and as fit as she was\nyesterday? If we saw clearly into each other's bosom, whom should we\nthink worthy?\"\n\n\"But you would not choose for your friend one--one who could do such\na deed as that?\"\n\n\"No; I would not choose her because she had so acted; nor perhaps if\nI knew all beforehand would I open my heart to one who had so done.\nBut it is different now. What are love and friendship worth if they\ncannot stand against such trials as these?\"\n\n\"Do you mean, Edith, that no crime would separate you from a friend?\"\n\n\"I have not said that. There are circumstances always. But if she\nrepents,--as I am sure she does, I cannot bring myself to desert her.\nWho else is there that can stand by her now; what other woman? At any\nrate I have promised her, and you would not have me break my word.\"\n\nThus she again gained her point, and it was settled that for the\npresent Lady Mason should be allowed to occupy her own room,--her own\nroom, and occasionally Mrs. Orme's sitting-room, if it pleased her\nto do so. No day was named for her removal, but, Mrs. Orme perfectly\nunderstood that the sooner such a day could be fixed the better Sir\nPeregrine would be pleased. And, indeed, his household as at present\narranged was not a pleasant one. The servants had all heard of his\nintended marriage, and now they must also hear that that intention\nwas abandoned. And yet the lady would remain up stairs as a guest\nof his! There was much in this that was inconvenient; but under\ncircumstances as they now existed, what could he do?\n\nWhen all this was arranged and Mrs. Orme had dressed for dinner, she\nagain went to Lady Mason. She found her in bed, and told her that at\nnight she would come to her and tell her all. And then she instructed\nher own servant as to attending upon the invalid. In doing this she\nwas cunning in letting a word fall here and there, that might teach\nthe woman that that marriage purpose was all over; but nevertheless\nthere was so much care and apparent affection in her mode of\nspeaking, and she gave her orders for Lady Mason's comfort with so\nmuch earnestness, that no idea could get abroad in the household that\nthere had been any cause for absolute quarrel.\n\nLate at night, when her son had left her, she did go again to her\nguest's room, and sitting down by the bed-side she told her all that\nhad been planned, pointing out however with much care that, as a\npart of those plans, Orley Farm was to be surrendered to Joseph\nMason. \"You think that is right; do you not?\" said Mrs. Orme, almost\ntrembling as she asked a question so pertinent to the deed which the\nother had done, and to that repentance for the deed which was now so\nmuch to be desired.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other, \"of course it will be right.\" And then the\nthought that it was not in her power to abandon the property occurred\nto her also. If the estate must be voluntarily surrendered, no one\ncould so surrender it but Lucius Mason. She knew this, and felt at\nthe moment that of all men he would be the least likely to do so,\nunless an adequate reason was made clearly plain to him. The same\nthought at the same moment was passing through the minds of them\nboth; but Lady Mason could not speak out her thought, and Mrs. Orme\nwould not say more on that terrible day to trouble the mind of the\npoor creature whose sufferings she was so anxious to assuage.\n\nAnd then Lady Mason was left alone, and having now a partner in her\nsecret, slept sounder than she had done since the tidings first\nreached her of Mr. Dockwrath's vengeance.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nTHE GEM OF THE FOUR FAMILIES.\n\n\nAnd now we will go back to Noningsby. On that evening Graham ate his\npheasant with a relish although so many cares sat heavy on his mind,\nand declared, to Mrs. Baker's great satisfaction, that the cook had\nmanaged to preserve the bread sauce uninjured through all the perils\nof delay which it had encountered.\n\n\"Bread sauce is so ticklish; a simmer too much and it's clean done\nfor,\" Mrs. Baker said with a voice of great solicitude. But she had\nbeen accustomed perhaps to patients whose appetites were fastidious.\nThe pheasant and the bread sauce and the mashed potatoes, all\nprepared by Mrs. Baker's own hands to be eaten as spoon meat,\ndisappeared with great celerity; and then, as Graham sat sipping the\nsolitary glass of sherry that was allowed to him, meditating that\nhe would begin his letter the moment the glass was empty, Augustus\nStaveley again made his appearance.\n\n[Illustration: \"Bread Sauce is so ticklish.\"]\n\n\"Well, old fellow,\" said he, \"how are you now?\" and he was\nparticularly careful so to speak as to show by his voice that his\naffection for his friend was as strong as ever. But in doing so he\nshowed also that there was some special thought still present in his\nmind,--some feeling which was serious in its nature if not absolutely\npainful.\n\n\"Staveley,\" said the other, gravely, \"I have acquired knowledge\nto-day which I trust I may carry with me to my grave.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\" said Augustus, looking round to Mrs. Baker as\nthough he thought it well that she should be out of the room before\nthe expected communication was made. But Mrs. Baker's attention was\nso riveted by her patient's earnestness, that she made no attempt to\ngo.\n\n\"It is a wasting of the best gifts of Providence,\" said Graham, \"to\neat a pheasant after one has really done one's dinner.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's it, is it?\" said Augustus.\n\n\"So it is, sir,\" said Mrs. Baker, thinking that the subject quite\njustified the manner.\n\n\"And of no use whatsoever to eat only a little bit of one as a man\ndoes then. To know what a pheasant is you should have it all to\nyourself.\"\n\n\"So you should, sir,\" said Mrs. Baker, quite delighted and very much\nin earnest.\n\n\"And you should have nothing else. Then, if the bird be good to begin\nwith, and has been well hung--\"\n\n\"There's a deal in that,\" said Mrs. Baker.\n\n\"Then, I say, you'll know what a pheasant is. That's the lesson which\nI have learned to-day, and I give it you as an adequate return for\nthe pheasant itself.\"\n\n\"I was almost afeard it would be spoilt by being brought up the\nsecond time,\" said Mrs. Baker. \"And so I said to my lady; but she\nwouldn't have you woke, nohow.\" And then Mrs. Baker, having heard the\nlast of the lecture, took away the empty wine-glass and shut the door\nbehind her.\n\n\"And now I'll write those two letters,\" said Graham. \"What I've\nwritten hitherto I wrote in bed, and I feel almost more awkward now I\nam up than I did then.\"\n\n\"But what letters are they?\"\n\n\"Well, one to my laundress to tell her I shall be there to-morrow,\nand one to Mary Snow to say that I'll see her the day after.\"\n\n\"Then, Felix, don't trouble yourself to write either. You positively\nwon't go to-morrow--\"\n\n\"Who says so?\"\n\n\"The governor. He has heard from my mother exactly what the doctor\nsaid, and declares that he won't allow it. He means to see the doctor\nhimself before you stir. And he wants to see you also. I am to tell\nyou he'll come to you directly after breakfast.\"\n\n\"I shall be delighted to see your father, and am very much gratified\nby his kindness, but--\"\n\n\"But what--\"\n\n\"I'm a free agent, I suppose,--to go when I please?\"\n\n\"Not exactly. The law is unwritten; but by traditional law a man laid\nup in his bedroom is not free to go and come. No action for false\nimprisonment would lie if Mrs. Baker kept all your clothes away from\nyou.\"\n\n\"I should like to try the question.\"\n\n\"You will have the opportunity, for you may be sure that you'll not\nleave this to-morrow.\"\n\n\"It would depend altogether on the evidence of the doctor.\"\n\n\"Exactly so. And as the doctor in this case would clearly be on the\nside of the defendants, a verdict on behalf of the plaintiff would\nnot be by any means attainable.\" After that the matter was presumed\nto be settled, and Graham said no more as to leaving Noningsby on\nthe next day. As things turned out afterwards he remained there for\nanother week.\n\n\"I must at any rate write a letter to Mary Snow,\" he said. And to\nMary Snow he did write some three or four lines, Augustus sitting by\nthe while. Augustus Staveley would have been very glad to know the\ncontents, or rather the spirit of those lines; but nothing was said\nabout them, and the letter was at last sealed up and intrusted to\nhis care for the post-bag. There was very little in it that could\nhave interested Augustus Staveley or any one else. It contained the\nordinary, but no more than the ordinary terms of affection. He told\nher that he found it impracticable to move himself quite immediately.\nAnd then as to that cause of displeasure,--that cause of supposed\ndispleasure as to which both Mary and Mrs. Thomas had written, he\ndeclared that he did not believe that anything had been done that he\nshould not find it easy to forgive after so long an absence.\n\nAugustus then remained there for another hour, but not a word was\nsaid between the young men on that subject which was nearest, at the\nmoment, to the hearts of both of them. Each was thinking of Madeline,\nbut neither of them spoke as though any such subject were in their\nthoughts.\n\n\"Heaven and earth!\" said Augustus at last, pulling out his watch. \"It\nonly wants three minutes to seven. I shall have a dozen messages from\nthe judge before I get down, to know whether he shall come and help\nme change my boots. I'll see you again before I go to bed. Good-bye,\nold fellow.\" And then Graham was again alone.\n\nIf Lady Staveley were really angry with him for loving her\ndaughter,--if his friend Staveley were in very truth determined\nthat such love must under no circumstances be sanctioned,--would\nthey treat him as they were treating him? Would they under such\ncircumstances make his prolonged stay in the house an imperative\nnecessity? He could not help asking himself this question, and\nanswering it with some gleam of hope. And then he acknowledged\nto himself that it was ungenerous in him to do so. His remaining\nthere,--the liberty to remain there which had been conceded to\nhim,--had arisen solely from the belief that a removal in his present\nstate would be injudicious. He assured himself of this over and over\nagain, so that no false hope might linger in his heart. And yet hope\ndid linger there whether false or true. Why might he not aspire to\nthe hand of Madeline Staveley,--he who had been assured that he need\nregard no woman as too high for his aspirations?\n\n\"Mrs. Baker,\" he said that evening, as that excellent woman was\ntaking away his tea-things, \"I have not heard Miss Staveley's voice\nthese two days.\"\n\n\"Well, no; no more you have,\" said she. \"There's two ways, you know,\nMr. Graham, of going to her part of the house. There's the door that\nopens at the end of the passage by her mamma's room. She's been that\nway, and that's the reason, I suppose. There ain't no other, I'm\nsure.\"\n\n\"One likes to hear one's friends if one can't see them; that's all.\"\n\n\"To be sure one does. I remember as how when I had the measles--I was\nliving with my lady's mother, as maid to the young ladies. There was\nfour of 'em, and I dressed 'em all--God bless 'em. They've all got\nhusbands now and grown families--only there ain't one among 'em equal\nto our Miss Madeline, though there's some of 'em much richer. When\nmy lady married him,--the judge, you know,--he was the poorest of\nthe lot. They didn't think so much of him when he came a-courting in\nthose days.\"\n\n\"He was only a practising barrister then.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; he knew well how to practise, for Miss Isabella--as she was\nthen--very soon made up her mind about him. Laws, Mr. Graham, she\nused to tell me everything in them days. They didn't want her to\nhave nothing to say to Mr. Staveley at first; but she made up her\nmind, and though she wasn't one of them as has many words, like Miss\nFurnival down there, there was no turning her.\"\n\n\"Did she marry at last against their wish?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, no; nothing of that sort. She wasn't one of them flighty\nones neither. She just made up her own mind and bided. And now I\ndon't know whether she hasn't done about the best of 'em all. Them\nOliphants is full of money, they do say--full of money. That was\nMiss Louisa, who came next. But, Lord love you, Mr. Graham, he's so\ncrammed with gout as he can't ever put a foot to the ground; and as\ncross;--as cross as cross. We goes there sometimes, you know. Then\nthe girls is all plain; and young Mr. Oliphant, the son,--why he\nnever so much as speaks to his own father; and though they're rolling\nin money, they say he can't pay for the coat on his back. Now our Mr.\nAugustus, unless it is that he won't come down to morning prayers and\nalways keeps the dinner waiting, I don't think there's ever a black\nlook between him and his papa. And as for Miss Madeline,--she's the\ngem of the four families. Everybody gives that up to her.\"\n\nIf Madeline's mother married a barrister in opposition to the wishes\nof her family--a barrister who then possessed nothing but his\nwits--why should not Madeline do so also? That was of course the line\nwhich his thoughts took. But then, as he said to himself, Madeline's\nfather had been one of the handsomest men of his day, whereas he was\none of the ugliest; and Madeline's father had been encumbered with no\nMary Snow. A man who had been such a fool as he, who had gone so far\nout of the regular course, thinking to be wiser than other men, but\nbeing in truth much more silly, could not look for that success and\nhappiness in life which men enjoy who have not been so lamentably\ndeficient in discretion! 'Twas thus that he lectured himself; but\nstill he went on thinking of Madeline Staveley.\n\nThere had been some disagreeable confusion in the house that\nafternoon after Augustus had spoken to his sister. Madeline had gone\nup to her own room, and had remained there, chewing the cud of her\nthoughts. Both her sister and her brother had warned her about this\nman. She could moreover divine that her mother was suffering under\nsome anxiety on the same subject. Why was all this? Why should these\nthings be said and thought? Why should there be uneasiness in the\nhouse on her account in this matter of Mr. Graham? She acknowledged\nto herself that there was such uneasiness;--and she almost\nacknowledged to herself the cause.\n\nBut while she was still sitting over her own fire, with her needle\nuntouched beside her, her father had come home, and Lady Staveley had\nmentioned to him that Mr. Graham thought of going on the next day.\n\n\"Nonsense, my dear,\" said the judge. \"He must not think of such a\nthing. He can hardly be fit to leave his room yet.\"\n\n\"Pottinger does say that it has gone on very favourably,\" pleaded\nLady Staveley.\n\n\"But that's no reason he should destroy the advantages of his healthy\nconstitution by insane imprudence. He's got nothing to do. He wants\nto go merely because he thinks he is in your way.\"\n\nLady Staveley looked wishfully up in her husband's face, longing to\ntell him all her suspicions. But as yet her grounds for them were so\nslight that even to him she hesitated to mention them.\n\n\"His being here is no trouble to me, of course,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course not. You tell him so, and he'll stay,\" said the judge. \"I\nwant to see him to-morrow myself;--about this business of poor Lady\nMason's.\"\n\nImmediately after that he met his son. And Augustus also told him\nthat Graham was going.\n\n\"Oh no; he's not going at all,\" said the judge. \"I've settled that\nwith your mother.\"\n\n\"He's very anxious to be off,\" said Augustus gravely.\n\n\"And why? Is there any reason?\"\n\n\"Well; I don't know.\" For a moment he thought he would tell his\nfather the whole story; but he reflected that his doing so would\nbe hardly fair towards his friend. \"I don't know that there is any\nabsolute reason; but I'm quite sure that he is very anxious to go.\"\n\nThe judge at once perceived that there was something in the wind,\nand during that hour in which the pheasant was being discussed up\nin Graham's room, he succeeded in learning the whole from his wife.\nDear, good, loving wife! A secret of any kind from him was an\nimpossibility to her, although that secret went no further than her\nthoughts.\n\n\"The darling girl is so anxious about him, that--that I'm afraid,\"\nsaid she.\n\n\"He's by no means a bad sort of man, my love,\" said the judge.\n\n\"But he's got nothing--literally nothing,\" said the mother.\n\n\"Neither had I, when I went a wooing,\" said the judge. \"But,\nnevertheless, I managed to have it all my own way.\"\n\n\"You don't mean really to make a comparison?\" said Lady Staveley. \"In\nthe first place you were at the top of your profession.\"\n\n\"Was I? If so I must have achieved that distinction at a very early\nage.\" And then he kissed his wife very affectionately. Nobody was\nthere to see, and under such circumstances a man may kiss his wife\neven though he be a judge, and between fifty and sixty years old.\nAfter that he again spoke to his son, and in spite of the resolves\nwhich Augustus had made as to what friendship required of him,\nsucceeded in learning the whole truth.\n\nLate in the evening, when all the party had drunk their cups of tea,\nwhen Lady Staveley was beginning her nap, and Augustus was making\nhimself agreeable to Miss Furnival--to the great annoyance of\nhis mother, who half rousing herself every now and then, looked\nsorrowfully at what was going on with her winking eyes,--the judge\ncontrived to withdraw with Madeline into the small drawing-room,\ntelling her as he put his arm around her waist, that he had a few\nwords to say to her.\n\n\"Well, papa,\" said she, as at his bidding she sat herself down beside\nhim on the sofa. She was frightened, because such summonses were very\nunusual; but nevertheless her father's manner towards her was always\nso full of love that even in her fear she felt a comfort in being\nwith him.\n\n\"My darling,\" he said, \"I want to ask you one or two questions--about\nour guest here who has hurt himself,--Mr. Graham.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\" And now she knew that she was trembling with nervous\ndread.\n\n\"You need not think that I am in the least angry with you, or that I\nsuspect you of having done or said, or even thought anything that is\nwrong. I feel quite confident that I have no cause to do so.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, papa.\"\n\n\"But I want to know whether Mr. Graham has ever spoken to you--as a\nlover.\"\n\n\"Never, papa.\"\n\n\"Because under the circumstances of his present stay here, his doing\nso would, I think, have been ungenerous.\"\n\n\"He never has, papa, in any way--not a single word.\"\n\n\"And you have no reason to regard him in that light.\"\n\n\"No, papa.\" But in the speaking of these last two words there was a\nslight hesitation,--the least possible shade of doubt conveyed, which\nmade itself immediately intelligible to the practised ear of the\njudge.\n\n\"Tell me all, my darling;--everything that there is in your heart, so\nthat we may help each other if that may be possible.\"\n\n\"He has never said anything to me, papa.\"\n\n\"Because your mamma thinks that you are more anxious about him than\nyou would be about an ordinary visitor.\"\n\n\"Does she?\"\n\n\"Has any one else spoken to you about Mr. Graham?\"\n\n\"Augustus did, papa; and Isabella, some time ago.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose they thought the same.\"\n\n\"Yes; I suppose they did.\"\n\n\"And now, dear, is there anything else you would like to say to me\nabout it?\"\n\n\"No, papa, I don't think there is.\"\n\n\"But remember this always;--that my only wishes respecting you, and\nyour mother's wishes also, are to see you happy and good.\"\n\n\"I am very happy, papa.\"\n\n\"And very good also to the best of my belief.\" And then he kissed\nher, and they went back again into the large drawing-room.\n\nMany of my readers, and especially those who are old and wise,--if I\nchance to have any such,--will be inclined to think that the judge\nbehaved foolishly in thus cross-questioning his daughter on a matter,\nwhich, if it were expedient that it should die away, would die away\nthe more easily the less it were talked about. But the judge was\nan odd man in many of the theories of his life. One of them, with\nreference to his children, was very odd, and altogether opposed to\nthe usual practice of the world. It was this,--that they should be\nallowed, as far as was practicable, to do what they liked. Now the\ngeneral opinion of the world is certainly quite the reverse--namely\nthis, that children, as long as they are under the control of their\nparents, should be hindered and prevented in those things to which\nthey are most inclined. Of course the world in general, in carrying\nout this practice, excuses it by an assertion,--made to themselves\nor others,--that children customarily like those things which they\nought not to like. But the judge had an idea quite opposed to this.\nChildren, he said, if properly trained would like those things which\nwere good for them. Now it may be that he thought his daughter had\nbeen properly trained.\n\n\"He is a very clever young man, my dear; you may be sure of that,\"\nwere the last words which the judge said to his wife that night.\n\n\"But then he has got nothing,\" she replied; \"and he is so uncommonly\nplain.\"\n\nThe judge would not say a word more, but he could not help thinking\nthat this last point was one which might certainly be left to the\nyoung lady.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nTHE ANGEL OF LIGHT UNDER A CLOUD.\n\n\nOn the following morning, according to appointment, the judge visited\nFelix Graham in his room. It was only the second occasion on which he\nhad done so since the accident, and he was therefore more inclined to\nregard him as an invalid than those who had seen him from day to day.\n\n\"I am delighted to hear that your bones have been so amenable,\" said\nthe judge. \"But you must not try them too far. We'll get you down\nstairs into the drawing-room, and see how you get on there by the\nnext few days.\"\n\n\"I don't want to trouble you more than I can help,\" said Felix,\nsheepishly. He knew that there were reasons why he should not go\ninto that drawing-room, but of course he could not guess that those\nreasons were as well known to the judge as they were to himself.\n\n\"You sha'n't trouble us--more than you can help. I am not one of\nthose men who tell my friends that nothing is a trouble. Of course\nyou give trouble.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry!\"\n\n\"There's your bed to make, my dear fellow, and your gruel to warm.\nYou know Shakspeare pretty well by heart I believe, and he puts that\nmatter,--as he did every other matter,--in the best and truest point\nof view. Lady Macbeth didn't say she had no labour in receiving the\nking. 'The labour we delight in physics pain,' she said. Those were\nher words, and now they are mine.\"\n\n\"With a more honest purpose behind,\" said Felix.\n\n\"Well, yes; I've no murder in my thoughts at present. So that is all\nsettled, and Lady Staveley will be delighted to see you down stairs\nto-morrow.\"\n\n\"I shall be only too happy,\" Felix answered, thinking within his own\nmind that he must settle it all in the course of the day with\nAugustus.\n\n\"And now perhaps you will be strong enough to say a few words about\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Graham.\n\n\"You have heard of this Orley Farm case, in which our neighbour Lady\nMason is concerned.\"\n\n\"Oh yes; we were all talking of it at your table;--I think it was the\nnight, or a night or two, before my accident.\"\n\n\"Very well; then you know all about it. At least as much as the\npublic knows generally. It has now been decided on the part of Joseph\nMason,--the husband's eldest son, who is endeavouring to get the\nproperty,--that she shall be indicted for perjury.\"\n\n\"For perjury!\"\n\n\"Yes; and in doing that, regarding the matter from his point of view,\nthey are not deficient in judgment.\"\n\n\"But how could she have been guilty of perjury?\"\n\n\"In swearing that she had been present when her husband and the three\nwitnesses executed the deed. If they have any ground to stand on--and\nI believe they have none whatever, but if they have, they would much\nmore easily get a verdict against her on that point than on a charge\nof forgery. Supposing it to be the fact that her husband never\nexecuted such a deed, it would be manifest that she must have sworn\nfalsely in swearing that she saw him do so.\"\n\n\"Why, yes; one would say so.\"\n\n\"But that would afford by no means conclusive evidence that she had\nforged the surreptitious deed herself.\"\n\n\"It would be strong presumptive evidence that she was cognizant of\nthe forgery.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,--but uncorroborated would hardly bring a verdict after\nsuch a lapse of years. And then moreover a prosecution for forgery,\nif unsuccessful, would produce more painful feeling. Whether\nsuccessful or unsuccessful it would do so. Bail could not be taken in\nthe first instance, and such a prosecution would create a stronger\nfeeling that the poor lady was being persecuted.\"\n\n\"Those who really understand the matter will hardly thank them for\ntheir mercy.\"\n\n\"But then so few will really understand it. The fact however is\nthat she will be indicted for perjury. I do not know whether the\nindictment has not been already laid. Mr. Furnival was with me in\ntown yesterday, and at his very urgent request, I discussed the whole\nsubject with him. I shall be on the Home Circuit myself on these next\nspring assizes, but I shall not take the criminal business at Alston.\nIndeed I should not choose that this matter should be tried before me\nunder any circumstances, seeing that the lady is my near neighbour.\nNow Furnival wants you to be engaged on the defence as junior\ncounsel.\"\n\n\"With himself?\"\n\n\"Yes; with himself,--and with Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"With Mr. Chaffanbrass!\" said Graham, in a tone almost of horror--as\nthough he had been asked to league himself with all that was most\ndisgraceful in the profession;--as indeed perhaps he had been.\n\n\"Yes--with Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"Will that be well, judge, do you think?\"\n\n\"Mr. Chaffanbrass no doubt is a very clever man, and it may be wise\nin such a case as this to have the services of a barrister who is\nperhaps unequalled in his power of cross-examining a witness.\"\n\n\"Does his power consist in making a witness speak the truth, or in\nmaking him conceal it?\"\n\n\"Perhaps in both. But here, if it be the case as Mr. Furnival\nsuspects, that witnesses will be suborned to give false evidence--\"\n\n\"But surely the Rounds would have nothing to do with such a matter as\nthat?\"\n\n\"No, probably not. I am sure that old Richard Round would abhor any\nsuch work as you or I would do. They take the evidence as it is\nbrought to them. I believe there is no doubt that at any rate one\nof the witnesses to the codicil in question will now swear that the\nsignature to the document is not her signature.\"\n\n\"A woman--is it?\"\n\n\"Yes; a woman. In such a case it may perhaps be allowable to employ\nsuch a man as Mr. Chaffanbrass; and I should tell you also, such\nanother man as Mr. Solomon Aram.\"\n\n\"Solomon Aram, too! Why, judge, the Old Bailey will be left bare.\"\n\n\"The shining lights will certainly be down at Alston. Now under those\ncircumstances will you undertake the case?\"\n\n\"Would you;--in my place?\"\n\n\"Yes; if I were fully convinced of the innocence of my client at the\nbeginning.\"\n\n\"But what if I were driven to change my opinion as the thing\nprogressed?\"\n\n\"You must go on, in such a case, as a matter of course.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can have a day or two to think of it?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I should not myself be the bearer to you of Mr. Furnival's\nmessage, were it not that I think that Lady Mason is being very\ncruelly used in the matter. If I were a young man in your position,\nI should take up the case _con amore_, for the sake of beauty and\nwomanhood. I don't say that that Quixotism is very wise; but still I\ndon't think it can be wrong to join yourself even with such men as\nChaffanbrass and Mr. Solomon Aram, if you can feel confident that you\nhave justice and truth on your side.\" Then after a few more words the\ninterview was over, and the judge left the room making some further\nobservation as to his hope of seeing Graham in the drawing-room on\nthe next day.\n\nOn the following morning there came from Peckham two more letters for\nGraham, one of course from Mary Snow, and one from Mrs. Thomas. We\nwill first give attention to that from the elder lady. She commenced\nwith much awe, declaring that her pen trembled within her fingers,\nbut that nevertheless she felt bound by her conscience and that\nduty which she owed to Mr. Graham, to tell him everything that had\noccurred,--\"word by word,\" as she expressed it. And then Felix,\nlooking at the letter, saw that he held in his hand two sheets of\nletter paper, quite full of small writing, the latter of which was\ncrossed. She went on to say that her care had been unremitting, and\nher solicitude almost maternal; that Mary's conduct had on the whole\nbeen such as to inspire her with \"undeviating confidence;\" but that\nthe guile of the present age was such, especially in respect to\nfemale servants--who seemed, in Mrs. Thomas's opinion, to be sent in\nthese days express from a very bad place for the express assistance\nof a very bad gentleman--that it was impossible for any woman, let\nher be ever so circumspect, to say \"what was what, or who was who.\"\nFrom all which Graham learned that Mrs. Thomas had been \"done;\" but\nby the middle of the third page he had as yet learned nothing as to\nthe manner of the doing.\n\nBut by degrees the long reel unwinded itself;--angel of light, and\nall. Mary Snow had not only received but had answered a lover's\nletter. She had answered that lover's letter by making an appointment\nwith him; and she had kept that appointment,--with the assistance of\nthe agent sent express from that very bad gentleman. All this Mrs.\nThomas had only discovered afterwards by finding the lover's letter,\nand the answer which the angel of light had written. Both of these\nshe copied verbatim, thinking probably that the original documents\nwere too precious to be intrusted to the post; and then ended by\nsaying that an additional year of celibacy, passed under a closer\nespionage, and with more severe moral training, might still perhaps\nmake Mary Snow fit for the high destiny which had been promised to\nher.\n\nThe only part of this letter which Felix read twice was that which\ncontained the answer from the angel of light to her lover. \"You have\nbeen very wicked to address me,\" the angel of light said severely.\n\"And it is almost impossible that I should ever forgive you!\" If only\nshe could have brought herself to end there! But her nature, which\nthe lover had greatly belied in likening it to her name, was not cold\nenough for this. So she added a few more words very indiscreetly. \"As\nI want to explain to you why I can never see you again, I will meet\nyou on Thursday afternoon, at half-past four, a little way up Clapham\nLane, at the corner of the doctor's wall, just beyond the third\nlamp.\" It was the first letter she had ever written to a lover, and\nthe poor girl had betrayed herself by keeping a copy of it.\n\nAnd then Graham came to Mary Snow's letter to himself, which, as it\nwas short, the reader shall have entire.\n\n\n   MY DEAR MR. GRAHAM,\n\n   I never was so unhappy in my life, and I am sure I don't\n   know how to write to you. Of course I do not think you\n   will ever see me again unless it be to upbraid me for my\n   perfidy, and I almost hope you won't, for I should sink\n   into the ground before your eyes. And yet I didn't mean to\n   do anything very wrong, and when I did meet him I wouldn't\n   as much as let him take me by the hand;--not of my own\n   accord. I don't know what she has said to you, and I think\n   she ought to have let me read it; but she speaks to me now\n   in such a way that I don't know how to bear it. She has\n   rummaged among everything I have got, but I am sure she\n   could find nothing except those two letters. It wasn't my\n   fault that he wrote to me, though I know now I ought not\n   to have met him. He is quite a genteel young man, and very\n   respectable in the medical line; only I know that makes\n   no difference now, seeing how good you have been to me. I\n   don't ask you to forgive me, but it nearly kills me when I\n   think of poor papa.\n\n   Yours always, most unhappy, and very sorry for what I have\n   done,\n\n   MARY SNOW.\n\n\nPoor Mary Snow! Could any man under such circumstances have been\nangry with her? In the first place if men will mould their wives,\nthey must expect that kind of thing; and then, after all, was there\nany harm done? If ultimately he did marry Mary Snow, would she make\na worse wife because she had met the apothecary's assistant at the\ncorner of the doctor's wall, under the third lamp-post? Graham, as he\nsat with the letters before him, made all manner of excuses for her;\nand this he did the more eagerly, because he felt that he would have\nwillingly made this affair a cause for breaking off his engagement,\nif his conscience had not told him that it would be unhandsome in him\nto do so.\n\nWhen Augustus came he could not show the letters to him. Had he done\nso it would have been as much as to declare that now the coast was\nclear as far as he was concerned. He could not now discuss with his\nfriend the question of Mary Snow, without also discussing the other\nquestion of Madeline Staveley. So he swept the letters away, and\ntalked almost entirely about the Orley Farm case.\n\n\"I only wish I were thought good enough for the chance,\" said\nAugustus. \"By heavens! I would work for that woman as I never could\nwork again for any fee that could be offered me.\"\n\n\"So would I; but I don't like my fellow-labourers.\"\n\n\"I should not mind that.\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Graham, \"there can be no possible doubt as to her\nabsolute innocence?\"\n\n\"None whatever. My father has no doubt. Furnival has no doubt. Sir\nPeregrine has no doubt,--who, by-the-by, is going to marry her.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Oh, but he is though. He has taken up her case _con amore_ with a\nvengeance.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry for that. It makes me think him a fool, and her--a\nvery clever woman.\"\n\nAnd so that matter was discussed, but not a word was said between\nthem about Mary Snow, or as to that former conversation respecting\nMadeline Staveley. Each felt then there was a reserve between them;\nbut each felt also that there was no way of avoiding this. \"The\ngovernor seems determined that you sha'n't stir yet awhile,\" Augustus\nsaid as he was preparing to take his leave.\n\n\"I shall be off in a day or two at the furthest all the same,\" said\nGraham.\n\n\"And you are to drink tea down stairs to-night. I'll come and fetch\nyou as soon as we're out of the dining-room. I can assure you that\nyour first appearance after your accident has been duly announced to\nthe public, and that you are anxiously expected.\" And then Staveley\nleft him.\n\nSo he was to meet Madeline that evening. His first feeling at the\nthought was one of joy, but he soon brought himself almost to wish\nthat he could leave Noningsby without any such meeting. There\nwould have been nothing in it,--nothing that need have called for\nobservation or remark,--had he not told his secret to Augustus. But\nhis secret had been told to one, and might be known to others in the\nhouse. Indeed he felt sure that it was suspected by Lady Staveley. It\ncould not, as he said to himself, have been suspected by the judge,\nor the judge would not have treated him in so friendly a manner, or\nhave insisted so urgently on his coming down among them.\n\nAnd then, how should he carry himself in her presence? If he were to\nsay nothing to her, his saying nothing would be remarked; and yet\nhe felt that all his powers of self-control would not enable him to\nspeak to her in the same manner that he would speak to her sister. He\nhad to ask himself, moreover, what line of conduct he did intend to\nfollow. If he was still resolved to marry Mary Snow, would it not be\nbetter that he should take this bull by the horns and upset it at\nonce? In such case, Madeline Staveley must be no more to him than her\nsister. But then he had two intentions. In accordance with one he\nwould make Mary Snow his wife; and in following the other he would\nmarry Miss Staveley. It must be admitted that the two brides which he\nproposed to himself were very different. The one that he had moulded\nfor his own purposes was not, as he admitted, quite equal to her of\nwhom nature, education, and birth had had the handling.\n\nAgain he dined alone; but on this occasion Mrs. Baker was able to\nelicit from him no enthusiasm as to his dinner. And yet she had done\nher best, and placed before him a sweetbread and dish of sea-kale\nthat ought to have made him enthusiastic. \"I had to fight with the\ngardener for that like anything,\" she said, singing her own praises\nwhen he declined to sing them.\n\n\"Dear me! They'll think that I am a dreadful person to have in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Not a bit. Only they sha'n't think as how I'm going to be said 'no'\nto in that way when I've set my mind on a thing. I know what's going\nand I know what's proper. Why, laws, Mr. Graham, there's heaps of\nthings there and yet there's no getting of 'em;--unless there's a\nparty or the like of that. What's the use of a garden I say,--or of\na gardener neither, if you don't have garden stuff? It's not to look\nat. Do finish it now;--after all the trouble I had, standing over him\nin the cold while he cut it.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear, Mrs. Baker, why did you do that?\"\n\n\"He thought to perish me, making believe it took him so long to get\nat it; but I'm not so easy perished; I can tell him that! I'd have\nstood there till now but what I had it. Miss Madeline see'd me as I\nwas coming in, and asked me what I'd been doing.\"\n\n\"I hope you didn't tell her that I couldn't live without sea-kale?\"\n\n\"I told her that I meant to give you your dinner comfortable as long\nas you had it up here; and she said--; but laws, Mr. Graham, you\ndon't care what a young lady says to an old woman like me. You'll see\nher yourself this evening, and then you can tell her whether or no\nthe sea-kale was worth the eating! It's not so badly biled, I will\nsay that for Hannah Cook, though she is rampagious sometimes.\" He\nlonged to ask her what words Madeline had used, even in speaking on\nsuch a subject as this; but he did not dare to do so. Mrs. Baker was\nvery fond of talking about Miss Madeline, but Graham was by no means\nassured that he should find an ally in Mrs. Baker if he told her all\nthe truth.\n\nAt last the hour arrived, and Augustus came to convoy him down to\nthe drawing-room. It was now many days since he had been out of that\nroom, and the very fact of moving was an excitement to him. He hardly\nknew how he might feel in walking down stairs, and could not quite\nseparate the nervousness arising from his shattered bones from that\nother nervousness which came from his--shattered heart. The word is\nundoubtedly a little too strong, but as it is there, there let it\nstay. When he reached the drawing-room, he almost felt that he had\nbetter decline to enter it. The door however was opened, and he was\nin the room before he could make up his mind to any such step, and\nhe found himself being walked across the floor to some especial seat,\nwhile a dozen kindly anxious faces were crowding round him.\n\n\"Here's an arm-chair, Mr. Graham, kept expressly for you, near the\nfire,\" said Lady Staveley. \"And I am extremely glad to see you well\nenough to fill it.\"\n\n\"Welcome out of your room, sir,\" said the judge. \"I compliment you,\nand Pottinger also, upon your quick recovery; but allow me to tell\nyou that you don't yet look a man fit to rough it alone in London.\"\n\n\"I feel very well, sir,\" said Graham.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Arbuthnot greeted him, and Miss Furnival, and four or\nfive others who were of the party, and he was introduced to one or\ntwo whom he had not seen before. Marian too came up to him,--very\ngently, as though he were as brittle as glass, having been warned by\nher mother. \"Oh, Mr. Felix,\" she said, \"I was so unhappy when your\nbones were broken. I do hope they won't break again.\"\n\nAnd then he perceived that Madeline was in the room and was coming\nup to him. She had in truth not been there when he first entered,\nhaving thought it better, as a matter of strategy, to follow upon his\nfootsteps. He was getting up to meet her, when Lady Staveley spoke to\nhim.\n\n\"Don't move, Mr. Graham. Invalids, you know, are chartered.\"\n\n\"I am very glad to see you once more down stairs,\" said Madeline, as\nshe frankly gave him her hand,--not merely touching his--\"very, very\nglad. But I do hope you will get stronger before you venture to leave\nNoningsby. You have frightened us all very much by your terrible\naccident.\"\n\nAll this was said in her peculiarly sweet silver voice, not speaking\nas though she were dismayed and beside herself, or in a hurry to get\nthrough a lesson which she had taught herself. She had her secret to\nhide, and had schooled herself how to hide it. But in so schooling\nherself she had been compelled to acknowledge to herself that the\nsecret did exist. She had told herself that she must meet him, and\nthat in meeting him she must hide it. This she had done with absolute\nsuccess. Such is the peculiar power of women; and her mother, who had\nlistened not only to every word, but to every tone of her voice, gave\nher exceeding credit.\n\n\"There's more in her than I thought there was,\" said Sophia Furnival\nto herself, who had also listened and watched.\n\n\"It has not gone very deep, with her,\" said the judge, who on this\nmatter was not so good a judge as Miss Furnival.\n\n\"She cares about me just as Mrs. Baker does,\" said Graham to himself,\nwho was the worst judge of them all. He muttered something quite\nunintelligible in answer to the kindness of her words; and then\nMadeline, having gone through her task, retired to the further side\nof the round table, and went to work among the teacups.\n\nAnd then the conversation became general, turning altogether on the\naffairs of Lady Mason. It was declared as a fact by Lady Staveley\nthat there was to be a marriage between Sir Peregrine Orme and his\nguest, and all in the room expressed their sorrow. The women were\nespecially indignant. \"I have no patience with her,\" said Mrs.\nArbuthnot. \"She must know that such a marriage at his time of life\nmust be ridiculous, and injurious to the whole family.\"\n\nThe women were very indignant,--all except Miss Furnival, who did not\nsay much, but endeavoured to palliate the crimes of Lady Mason in\nthat which she did say. \"I do not know that she is more to blame\nthan any other lady who marries a gentleman thirty years older than\nherself.\"\n\n\"I do then,\" said Lady Staveley, who delighted in contradicting\nMiss Furnival. \"And so would you too, my dear, if you had known Sir\nPeregrine as long as I have. And if--if--if--but it does not matter.\nI am very sorry for Lady Mason,--very. I think she is a woman cruelly\nused by her own connections; but my sympathies with her would\nbe warmer if she had refrained from using her power over an old\ngentleman like Sir Peregrine, in the way she has done.\" In all which\nexpression of sentiment the reader will know that poor dear Lady\nStaveley was wrong from the beginning to the end.\n\n\"For my part,\" said the judge, \"I don't see what else she was to do.\nIf Sir Peregrine asked her, how could she refuse?\"\n\n\"My dear!\" said Lady Staveley.\n\n\"According to that, papa, every lady must marry any gentleman that\nasks her,\" said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\"When a lady is under so deep a weight of obligation I don't know how\nshe is to refuse. My idea is that Sir Peregrine should not have asked\nher.\"\n\n\"And mine too,\" said Felix. \"Unless indeed he did it under an\nimpression that he could fight for her better as her husband than\nsimply as a friend.\"\n\n\"And I feel sure that that is what he did think,\" said Madeline, from\nthe further side of the table. And her voice sounded in Graham's ears\nas the voice of Eve may have sounded to Adam. No; let him do what he\nmight in the world;--whatever might be the form in which his future\ncareer should be fashioned, one thing was clearly impossible to him.\nHe could not marry Mary Snow. Had he never learned to know what were\nthe true charms of feminine grace and loveliness, it might have been\npossible for him to do so, and to have enjoyed afterwards a fair\namount of contentment. But now even contentment would be impossible\nto him under such a lot as that. Not only would he be miserable, but\nthe woman whom he married would be wretched also. It may be said that\nhe made up his mind definitely, while sitting in that arm-chair, that\nhe would not marry Mary Snow. Poor Mary Snow! Her fault in the matter\nhad not been great.\n\nWhen Graham was again in his room, and the servant who was obliged\nto undress him had left him, he sat over his fire, wrapped in his\ndressing-gown, bethinking himself what he would do. \"I will tell the\njudge everything,\" he said at last. \"Then, if he will let me into his\nhouse after that, I must fight my own battle.\" And so he betook\nhimself to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nMRS. FURNIVAL CAN'T PUT UP WITH IT.\n\n\nWhen Lady Mason last left the chambers of her lawyer in Lincoln's\nInn, she was watched by a stout lady as she passed through the narrow\npassage leading from the Old to the New Square. That fact will I\ntrust be remembered, and I need hardly say that the stout lady was\nMrs. Furnival. She had heard betimes of the arrival of that letter\nwith the Hamworth post-mark, had felt assured that it was written by\nthe hands of her hated rival, and had at once prepared for action.\n\n\"I shall leave this house to-day,--immediately after breakfast,\" she\nsaid to Miss Biggs, as they sat disconsolately at the table with the\nurn between them.\n\n\"And I think you will be quite right, my dear,\" replied Miss Biggs.\n\"It is your bounden duty to put down such wicked iniquity as\nthis;--not only for your own sake, but for that of morals in general.\nWhat in the world is there so beautiful and so lovely as a high tone\nof moral sentiment?\" To this somewhat transcendental question Mrs.\nFurnival made no reply. That a high tone of moral sentiment as a\nthing in general, for the world's use, is very good, she was no doubt\naware; but her mind at the present moment was fixed exclusively on\nher own peculiar case. That Tom Furnival should be made to give up\nseeing that nasty woman who lived at Hamworth, and to give up also\nhaving letters from her,--that at present was the extent of her moral\nsentiment. His wicked iniquity she could forgive with a facility\nnot at all gratifying to Miss Biggs, if only she could bring about\nsuch a result as that. So she merely grunted in answer to the above\nproposition.\n\n\"And will you sleep away from this?\" asked Miss Biggs.\n\n\"Certainly I will. I will neither eat here, nor sleep here, nor stay\nhere till I know that all this is at an end. I have made up my mind\nwhat I will do.\"\n\n\"Well?\" asked the anxious Martha.\n\n\"Oh, never mind. I am not exactly prepared to talk about it. There\nare things one can't talk about,--not to anybody. One feels as though\none would burst in mentioning it. I do, I know.\"\n\nMartha Biggs could not but feel that this was hard, but she knew that\nfriendship is nothing if it be not long enduring. \"Dearest Kitty!\"\nshe exclaimed. \"If true sympathy can be of service to you--\"\n\n\"I wonder whether I could get respectable lodgings in the\nneighbourhood of Red Lion Square for a week?\" said Mrs. Furnival,\nonce more bringing the conversation back from the abstract to the\nconcrete.\n\nIn answer to this Miss Biggs of course offered the use of her own\nbedroom and of her father's house; but her father was an old man, and\nMrs. Furnival positively refused to agree to any such arrangement. At\nlast it was decided that Martha should at once go off and look for\nlodgings in the vicinity of her own home, that Mrs. Furnival should\nproceed to carry on her own business in her own way,--the cruelty\nbeing this, that she would not give the least hint as to what that\nway might be,--and that the two ladies should meet together in the\nRed Lion Square drawing-room at the close of the day.\n\n\"And about dinner, dear?\" asked Miss Biggs.\n\n\"I will get something at a pastrycook's,\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"And your clothes, dear?\"\n\n\"Rachel will see about them; she knows.\" Now Rachel was the old\nfemale servant of twenty years' standing; and the disappointment\nexperienced by poor Miss Biggs at the ignorance in which she was left\nwas greatly enhanced by a belief that Rachel knew more than she did.\nMrs. Furnival would tell Rachel but would not tell her. This was\nvery, very hard, as Miss Biggs felt. But, nevertheless, friendship,\nsincere friendship is long enduring, and true patient merit will\ngenerally receive at last its appropriate reward.\n\nThen Mrs. Furnival had sat down, Martha Biggs having been duly sent\nforth on the mission after the lodgings, and had written a letter to\nher husband. This she intrusted to Rachel, whom she did not purpose\nto remove from that abode of iniquity from which she herself was\nfleeing, and having completed her letter she went out upon her own\nwork. The letter ran as follows:--\n\n\n   Harley Street--Friday.\n\n   MY DEAREST TOM,\n\n   I cannot stand this any longer, so I have thought it best\n   to leave the house and go away. I am very sorry to be\n   forced to such a step as this, and would have put up with\n   a good deal first; but there are some things which I\n   cannot put up with,--and won't. I know that a woman has\n   to obey her husband, and I have always obeyed you, and\n   thought it no hardship even when I was left so much alone;\n   but a woman is not to see a slut brought in under her very\n   nose,--and I won't put up with it. We've been married now\n   going on over twenty-five years, and it's terrible to\n   think of being driven to this. I almost believe it will\n   drive me mad, and then, when I'm a lunatic, of course you\n   can do as you please.\n\n   I don't want to have any secrets from you. Where I shall\n   go I don't yet know, but I've asked Martha Biggs to take\n   lodgings for me somewhere near her. I must have somebody\n   to speak to now and again, so you can write to 23 Red Lion\n   Square till you hear further. It's no use sending for me,\n   for I _won't come_;--not till I know that you think better\n   of your present ways of going on. I don't know whether you\n   have the power to get the police to come after me, but I\n   advise you not. If you do anything of that sort the people\n   about shall hear of it.\n\n   And now, Tom, I want to say one word to you. You can't\n   think it's a happiness to me going away from my own home\n   where I have lived respectable so many years, or leaving\n   you whom I've loved with all my whole heart. It makes me\n   very very unhappy, so that I could sit and cry all day if\n   it weren't for pride and because the servants shouldn't\n   see me. To think that it has come to this after all! Oh,\n   Tom, I wonder whether you ever think of the old days when\n   we used to be so happy in Keppel Street! There wasn't\n   anybody then that you cared to see, except me;--I do\n   believe that. And you'd always come home then, and I never\n   thought bad of it though you wouldn't have a word to speak\n   to me for hours. Because you were doing your duty. But you\n   ain't doing your duty now, Tom. You know you ain't doing\n   your duty when you never dine at home, and come home so\n   cross with wine that you curse and swear, and have that\n   nasty woman coming to see you at your chambers. Don't tell\n   me it's about law business. Ladies don't go to barristers'\n   chambers about law business. All that is done by\n   attorneys. I've heard you say scores of times that you\n   never would see people themselves, and yet you see her.\n\n   Oh, Tom, you have made me so wretched! But I can forgive\n   it all, and will never say another word about it to fret\n   you, if you'll only promise me to have nothing more to\n   say to that woman. Of course I'd like you to come home to\n   dinner, but I'd put up with that. You've made your own way\n   in the world, and perhaps it's only right you should enjoy\n   it. I don't think so much dining at the club can be good\n   for you, and I'm afraid you'll have gout, but I don't\n   want to bother you about that. Send me a line to say that\n   you won't see her any more, and I'll come back to Harley\n   Street at once. If you can't bring yourself to do that,\n   you--and--I--must--part. I can put up with a great deal,\n   but I can't put up with that;--_and won't_.\n\n   Your affectionate loving wife,\n\n   C. FURNIVAL.\n\n\n\"I wonder whether you ever think of the old days when we used to be\nso happy in Keppel Street?\" Ah me, how often in after life, in those\nsuccessful days when the battle has been fought and won, when all\nseems outwardly to go well,--how often is this reference made to the\nhappy days in Keppel Street! It is not the prize that can make us\nhappy; it is not even the winning of the prize, though for the one\nshort half-hour of triumph that is pleasant enough. The struggle, the\nlong hot hour of the honest fight, the grinding work,--when the teeth\nare set, and the skin moist with sweat and rough with dust, when all\nis doubtful and sometimes desperate, when a man must trust to his own\nmanhood knowing that those around him trust to it not at all,--that\nis the happy time of life. There is no human bliss equal to twelve\nhours of work with only six hours in which to do it. And when\nthe expected pay for that work is worse than doubtful, the inner\nsatisfaction is so much the greater. Oh, those happy days in Keppel\nStreet, or it may be over in dirty lodgings in the Borough, or\nsomewhere near the Marylebone workhouse;--anywhere for a moderate\nweekly stipend. Those were to us, and now are to others, and always\nwill be to many, the happy days of life. How bright was love, and how\nfull of poetry! Flashes of wit glanced here and there, and how they\ncame home and warmed the cockles of the heart. And the unfrequent\nbottle! Methinks that wine has utterly lost its flavour since those\ndays. There is nothing like it; long work, grinding weary work, work\nwithout pay, hopeless work; but work in which the worker trusts\nhimself, believing it to be good. Let him, like Mahomet, have one\nother to believe in him, and surely nothing else is needed. \"Ah me! I\nwonder whether you ever think of the old days when we used to be so\nhappy in Keppel Street?\"\n\nNothing makes a man so cross as success, or so soon turns a pleasant\nfriend into a captious acquaintance. Your successful man eats too\nmuch and his stomach troubles him; he drinks too much and his nose\nbecomes blue. He wants pleasure and excitement, and roams about\nlooking for satisfaction in places where no man ever found it. He\nfrets himself with his banker's book, and everything tastes amiss to\nhim that has not on it the flavour of gold. The straw of an omnibus\nalways stinks; the linings of the cabs are filthy. There are but\nthree houses round London at which an eatable dinner may be obtained.\nAnd yet a few years since how delicious was that cut of roast goose\nto be had for a shilling at the eating-house near Golden Square. Mrs.\nJones and Mrs. Green, Mrs. Walker and all the other mistresses, are\ntoo vapid and stupid and humdrum for endurance. The theatres are dull\nas Lethe, and politics have lost their salt. Success is the necessary\nmisfortune of life, but it is only to the very unfortunate that it\ncomes early.\n\nMrs. Furnival, when she had finished her letter and fastened it, drew\none of the heavy dining-room arm-chairs over against the fire, and\nsat herself down to consider her past life, still holding the letter\nin her lap. She had not on that morning been very careful with her\ntoilet, as was perhaps natural enough. The cares of the world were\nheavy on her, and he would not be there to see her. Her hair was\nrough, and her face was red, and she had hardly had the patience\nto make straight the collar round her neck. To the eye she was\nan untidy, angry, cross-looking woman. But her heart was full of\ntenderness,--full to overflowing. She loved him now as well as ever\nshe had loved him:--almost more as the thought of parting from\nhim pressed upon her! Was he not all in all to her? Had she not\nworshipped him during her whole life? Could she not forgive him?\n\nForgive him! Yes. Forgive him with the fullest, frankest, freest\npardon, if he would only take forgiveness. Should she burn that\nletter in the fire, send to Biggs saying that the lodgings were not\nwanted, and then throw herself at Tom's feet, imploring him to have\nmercy upon her? All that she could do within her heart, and make her\nwords as passionate, as soft, and as poetical as might be those of a\nyoung wife of twenty. But she felt that such words,--though she could\nframe the sentence while sitting there,--could never get themselves\nspoken. She had tried it, and it had been of no avail. Not only\nshould she be prepared for softness, but he also must be so prepared\nand at the same moment. If he should push her from him and call her\na fool when she attempted that throwing of herself at his feet, how\nwould it be with her spirit then? No. She must go forth and the\nletter must be left. If there were any hope of union for the future\nit must come from a parting for the present. So she went up stairs\nand summoned Rachel, remaining with her in consultation for some\nhalf-hour. Then she descended with her bonnet and shawl, got into a\ncab while Spooner stood at the door looking very serious, and was\ndriven away,--whither, no one knew in Harley Street except Mrs.\nFurnival herself, and that cabman.\n\n\"She'll never put her foot inside this hall door again. That's my\nidea of the matter,\" said Spooner.\n\n\"Indeed and she will,\" said Rachel, \"and be a happier woman than ever\nshe's been since the house was took.\"\n\n\"If I know master,\" said Spooner, \"he's not the man to get rid of an\nold woman, easy like that, and then 'ave her back agin.\" Upon hearing\nwhich words, so very injurious to the sex in general, Rachel walked\ninto the house not deigning any further reply.\n\nAnd then, as we have seen, Mrs. Furnival was there, standing in the\ndark shadow of the Lincoln's Inn passage, when Lady Mason left the\nlawyer's chambers. She felt sure that it was Lady Mason, but she\ncould not be quite sure. The woman, though she came out from the\nentry which led to her husband's chambers, might have come down\nfrom some other set of rooms. Had she been quite certain she would\nhave attacked her rival there, laying bodily hands upon her in the\npurlieus of the Lord Chancellor's Court. As it was, the poor bruised\ncreature was allowed to pass by, and as she emerged out into the\nlight at the other end of the passage Mrs. Furnival became quite\ncertain of her identity.\n\n\"Never mind,\" she said to herself. \"She sha'n't escape me long. Him\nI could forgive, if he would only give it up; but as for her--! Let\nwhat come of it, come may, I will tell that woman what I think of her\nconduct before I am many hours older.\" Then, giving one look up to\nthe windows of her husband's chambers, she walked forth through the\ndusty old gate into Chancery Lane, and made her way on foot up to No.\n23 Red Lion Square. \"I'm glad I've done it,\" she said to herself as\nshe went; \"very glad. There's nothing else for it, when things come\nto such a head as that.\" And in this frame of mind she knocked at her\nfriend's door.\n\n\"Well!\" said Martha Biggs, with her eyes, and mouth, and arms, and\nheart all open.\n\n\"Have you got me the lodgings?\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"Yes, close by;--in Orange Street. I'm afraid you'll find them very\ndull. And what have you done?\"\n\n\"I have done nothing, and I don't at all mind their being dull. They\ncan't possibly be more dull than Harley Street.\"\n\n\"And I shall be near you; sha'n't I?\" said Martha Biggs.\n\n\"Umph,\" said Mrs. Furnival. \"I might as well go there at once and\nget myself settled.\" So she did, the affectionate Martha of course\naccompanying her; and thus the affairs of that day were over.\n\nHer intention was to go down to Hamworth at once, and make her way\nup to Orley Farm, at which place she believed that Lady Mason was\nliving. Up to this time she had heard no word of the coming trial\nbeyond what Mr. Furnival had told her as to his client's \"law\nbusiness.\" And whatever he had so told her, she had scrupulously\ndisbelieved. In her mind all that went for nothing. Law business! she\nwas not so blind, so soft, so green, as to be hoodwinked by such\nstuff as that. Beautiful widows don't have personal interviews with\nbarristers in their chambers over and over again, let them have what\nlaw business they may. At any rate Mrs. Furnival took upon herself to\nsay that they ought not to have such interviews. She would go down to\nOrley Farm and she would have an interview with Lady Mason. Perhaps\nthe thing might be stopped in that way.\n\nOn the following morning she received a note from her husband the\nconsideration of which delayed her proceedings for that day.\n\n\"DEAR KITTY,\" the note ran.\n\n\n   I think you are very foolish. If regard for me had not\n   kept you at home, some consideration with reference to\n   Sophia should have done so. What you say about that poor\n   lady at Orley Farm is too absurd for me to answer. If you\n   would have spoken to me about her, I would have told you\n   that which would have set your mind at rest, at any rate\n   as regards her. I cannot do this in a letter, nor could I\n   do it in the presence of your friend, Miss Biggs.\n\n   I hope you will come back at once; but I shall not add\n   to the absurdity of your leaving your own house by any\n   attempt to bring you back again by force. As you must want\n   money I enclose a check for fifty pounds. I hope you will\n   be back before you want more; but if not I will send it as\n   soon as you ask for it.\n\n   Yours affectionately as always,\n\n   T. FURNIVAL.\n\n\nThere was about this letter an absence of sentiment, and an absence\nof threat, and an absence of fuss, which almost overset her. Could\nit be possible that she was wrong about Lady Mason? Should she go to\nhim and hear his own account before she absolutely declared war by\nbreaking into the enemy's camp at Orley Farm? Then, moreover, she was\ntouched and almost overcome about the money. She wished he had not\nsent it to her. That money difficulty had occurred to her, and been\nmuch discussed in her own thoughts. Of course she could not live away\nfrom him if he refused to make her any allowance,--at least not for\nany considerable time. He had always been liberal as regards money\nsince money had been plenty with him, and therefore she had some\nsupply with her. She had jewels too which were her own; and though,\nas she had already determined, she would not part with them without\ntelling him what she was about to do, yet she could, if pressed, live\nin this way for the next twelve months;--perhaps, with close economy,\neven for a longer time than that. In her present frame of mind she\nhad looked forward almost with gratification to being pinched and\nmade uncomfortable. She would wear her ordinary and more dowdy\ndresses; she would spend much of her time in reading sermons; she\nwould get up very early and not care what she ate or drank. In short,\nshe would make herself as uncomfortable as circumstances would admit,\nand thoroughly enjoy her grievances.\n\nBut then this check of fifty pounds, and this offer of as much more\nas she wanted when that was gone, rather took the ground from under\nher feet. Unless she herself chose to give way she might go on living\nin Orange Street to the end of the chapter, with every material\ncomfort about her,--keeping her own brougham if she liked, for the\nchecks she now knew would come without stint. And he would go on\nliving in Harley street, seeing Lady Mason as often as he pleased.\nSophia would be the mistress of the house, and as long as this was\nso, Lady Mason would not show her face there. Now this was not a\ncourse of events to which Mrs. Furnival could bring herself to look\nforward with satisfaction.\n\nAll this delayed her during that day, but before she went to bed she\nmade up her mind that she would at any rate go down to Hamworth. Tom,\nshe knew, was deceiving her; of that she felt morally sure. She would\nat any rate go down to Hamworth, and trust to her own wit for finding\nout the truth when there.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nIT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE.\n\n\nAll was now sadness at The Cleeve. It was soon understood among the\nservants that there was to be no marriage, and the tidings spread\nfrom the house, out among the neighbours and into Hamworth. But no\none knew the reason of this change;--none except those three, the\nwoman herself who had committed the crime and the two to whom she had\ntold it. On that same night, the night of the day on which the tale\nhad been told, Lady Mason wrote a line,--almost a single line to her\nson.\n\n\n   DEAREST LUCIUS,\n\n   All is over between me and Sir Peregrine. It is better\n   that it should be so. I write to tell you this without\n   losing an hour. For the present I remain here with my\n   dear--dearest friends.\n\n   Your own affectionate mother,\n\n   M. MASON.\n\n\nThis note she had written in obedience to the behests of Mrs. Orme,\nand even under her dictation--with the exception of one or two words,\n\"I remain here with my friends,\" Mrs. Orme had said; but Lady Mason\nhad put in the two epithets, and had then declared her own conviction\nthat she had now no right to use such language.\n\n\"Yes, of me you may, certainly,\" said Mrs. Orme, keeping close to her\nshoulder.\n\n\"Then I will alter it,\" said Lady Mason. \"I will write it again and\nsay I am staying with you.\"\n\nBut this Mrs. Orme had forbidden. \"No; it will be better so,\" she\nsaid. \"Sir Peregrine would wish it. I am sure he would. He quite\nagrees that--\" Mrs. Orme did not finish her sentence, but the letter\nwas despatched, written as above. The answer which Lucius sent down\nbefore breakfast the next morning was still shorter.\n\n\n   DEAREST MOTHER,\n\n   I am greatly rejoiced that it is so.\n\n   Your affectionate son,\n\n   L. M.\n\n\nHe sent this note, but he did not go down to her, nor was there any\nother immediate communication between them.\n\nAll was now sadness at The Cleeve. Peregrine knew that that marriage\nproject was over, and he knew also that his grandfather and Lady\nMason did not now meet each other; but he knew nothing of the cause,\nthough he could not but remark that he did not see her. On that day\nshe did not come down either to dinner or during the evening; nor\nwas she seen on the following morning. He, Peregrine, felt aware\nthat something had occurred at that interview in the library after\nbreakfast, but was lost in surmising what that something had been.\nThat Lady Mason should have told his grandfather that the marriage\nmust be given up would have been only in accordance with the promise\nmade by her to him; but he did not think that that alone would\nhave occasioned such utter sadness, such deathlike silence in the\nhousehold. Had there been a quarrel Lady Mason would have gone\nhome;--but she did not go home. Had the match been broken off without\na quarrel, why should she mysteriously banish herself to two rooms so\nthat no one but his mother should see her?\n\nAnd he too had his own peculiar sorrow. On that morning Sir Peregrine\nhad asked him to ride through the grounds, and it had been the\nbaronet's intention to propose during that ride that he should go\nover to Noningsby and speak to the judge about Madeline. We all know\nhow that proposition had been frustrated. And now Peregrine, thinking\nover the matter, saw that his grandfather was not in a position at\nthe present moment to engage himself ardently in any such work. By\nwhatever means or whatever words he had been induced to agree to the\nabandonment of that marriage engagement, that abandonment weighed\nvery heavily on his spirits. It was plain to see that he was a broken\nman, broken in heart and in spirit. He shut himself up alone in his\nlibrary all that afternoon, and had hardly a word to say when he came\nout to dinner in the evening. He was very pale too, and slow and weak\nin his step. He tried to smile as he came up to his daughter-in-law\nin the drawing-room; but his smile was the saddest thing of all. And\nthen Peregrine could see that he ate nothing. He was very gentle\nin his demeanour to the servants, very courteous and attentive\nto Mrs. Orme, very kind to his grandson. But yet his mind was\nheavy;--brooding over some sorrow that oppressed it. On the following\nmorning it was the same, and the grandson knew that he could look to\nhis grandfather for no assistance at Noningsby.\n\nImmediately after breakfast Peregrine got on his horse, without\nspeaking to any one of his intention,--almost without having formed\nan intention, and rode off in the direction of Alston. He did not\ntake the road, but went out through The Cleeve woods, on to the\ncommon, by which, had he turned to the left, he might have gone to\nOrley Farm; but when on the top of the rise from Crutchley Bottom he\nturned to the right, and putting his horse into a gallop, rode along\nthe open ground till he came to an enclosure into which he leaped.\nFrom thence he made his way through a farm gate into a green country\nlane, along which he still pressed his horse, till he found himself\ndivided from the end of a large wood by but one field. He knew the\nground well, and the direction in which he was going. He could pass\nthrough that wood, and then down by an old farm-house at the other\nend of it, and so on to the Alston road, within a mile of Noningsby.\nHe knew the ground well, for he had ridden over every field of it.\nWhen a man does so after thirty he forgets the spots which he passes\nin his hurry, but when he does so before twenty he never forgets.\nThat field and that wood Peregrine Orme would never forget. There was\nthe double ditch and bank over which Harriet Tristram had ridden with\nso much skill and courage. There was the spot on which he had knelt\nso long, while Felix Graham lay back against him, feeble and almost\nspeechless. And there, on the other side, had sat Madeline on her\nhorse, pale with anxiety but yet eager with hope, as she asked\nquestion after question as to him who had been hurt.\n\nPeregrine rode up to the ditch, and made his horse stand while he\nlooked at it. It was there, then, on that spot, that he had felt the\nfirst pang of jealousy. The idea had occurred to him that he for\nwhom he had been doing a friend's offices with such zealous kindness\nwas his worst enemy. Had he,--he, Peregrine Orme,--broken his arms\nand legs, or even broken his neck, would she have ridden up, all\nthoughtless of herself, and thrown her very life into her voice as\nshe had done when she knew that Felix Graham had fallen from his\nhorse? And then he had gone on with his work, aiding the hurt man as\nzealously as before, but still feeling that he was bound to hate him.\nAnd afterwards, at Noningsby, he had continued to minister to him as\nto his friend,--zealously doing a friend's offices, but still feeling\nthat the man was his enemy. Not that he was insincere. There was no\nplace for insincerity or treachery within his heart. The man had done\nno ill,--was a good fellow--was entitled to his kindness by all the\nsocial laws which he knew. They two had gone together from the same\ntable to the same spot, and had been close together when the one had\ncome to sorrow. It was his duty to act as Graham's friend; and yet\nhow could he not feel that he must hate him?\n\nAnd now he sat looking at the fence, wishing,--wishing;--no,\ncertainly not wishing that Graham's hurt had been more serious; but\nwishing that in falling from his horse he might utterly have fallen\nout of favour with that sweet young female heart; or rather wishing,\ncould he so have expressed it, that he himself might have had the\nfall, and the broken bones, and all the danger,--so that he might\nalso have had the interest which those eyes and that voice had shown.\n\nAnd then quickly he turned his horse, and without giving the beast\ntime to steady himself he rammed him at the fence. The leap out of\nthe wood into the field was difficult, but that back into the wood\nwas still worse. The up-jump was higher, and the ditch which must be\nfirst cleared was broader. Nor did he take it at the easiest part as\nhe had done on that day when he rode his own horse and then Graham's\nback into the wood. But he pressed his animal exactly at the spot\nfrom which his rival had fallen. There were still the marks of the\nbeast's struggle, as he endeavoured to save himself before he came\ndown, head foremost, into the ditch. The bank had been somewhat\nnarrowed and pared away, and it was clearly the last place in the\nface of the whole opening into the wood, which a rider with his\nsenses about him would have selected for his jump.\n\nThe horse knowing his master's humour, and knowing also,--which is so\nvitally important,--the nature of his master's courage, jumped at the\nbank, without pausing. As I have said, no time had been given him to\nsteady himself,--not a moment to see where his feet should go, to\nunderstand and make the most of the ground that he was to use. He\njumped and jumped well, but only half gained the top of the bank. The\npoor brute, urged beyond his power, could not get his hind feet up so\nnear the surface as to give him a fulcrum for a second spring. For a\nmoment he strove to make good his footing, still clinging with his\nfore feet, and then slowly came down backwards into the ditch, then\nregained his feet, and dragging himself with an effort from the mud,\nmade his way back into the field. Peregrine Orme had kept his seat\nthroughout. His legs were accustomed to the saddle and knew how to\ncling to it, while there was a hope that he might struggle through.\nAnd now that he was again in the field he wheeled his horse to a\ngreater distance, striking him with his whip, and once more pushed\nhim at the fence. The gallant beast went at it bravely, slightly\nswerving from the fatal spot to which Peregrine had endeavoured once\nmore to guide him, leaped with a full spring from the unworn turf,\nand, barely touching the bank, landed himself and his master lightly\nwithin the precincts of the wood.\n\n\"Ah-h!\" said Peregrine, shouting angrily at the horse, as though the\nbrute had done badly instead of well. And then he rode down slowly\nthrough the wood, and out by Monkton Grange farm, round the moat, and\ndown the avenue, and before long he was standing at Noningsby gate.\n\nHe had not made up his mind to any plan of action, nor indeed had he\ndetermined that he would ask to see any of the family or even enter\nthe place. The woman at the lodge opened the gate, and he rode in\nmechanically, asking if any of them were at home. The judge and Mr.\nAugustus were gone up to London, but my lady and the other ladies\nwere in the house. Mr. Graham had not gone, the woman said in answer\nto his question; nor did she know when he was going. And then, armed\nwith this information, Peregrine Orme rode round to the stables, and\ngave up his horse to a groom.\n\n\"Yes, Lady Staveley was at home,\" the servant said at the door.\n\"Would Mr. Orme walk into the drawing-room, where he would find the\nyoung ladies?\" But Mr. Orme would not do this. He would go into a\nsmall book-room with which he was well acquainted, and have his name\ntaken up to Lady Staveley. \"He did not,\" he said, \"mean to stay very\nlong; but particularly wished to see Lady Staveley.\" In a few minutes\nLady Staveley came to him, radiant with her sweetest smile, and with\nboth her hands held out to greet him.\n\n\"My dear Mr. Orme,\" she said, \"I am delighted to see you; but what\nmade you run away from us so suddenly?\" She had considered her words\nin that moment as she came across the hall, and had thought that in\nthis way she might best enable him to speak.\n\n\"Lady Staveley,\" he said, \"I have come here on purpose to tell you.\nHas your daughter told you anything?\"\n\n\"Who--Madeline?\"\n\n\"Yes, Madeline. I mean Miss Staveley. Has she said anything to you\nabout me?\"\n\n\"Well; yes, she has. Will you not sit down, Mr. Orme, and then\nwe shall be more comfortable.\" Hitherto he had stood up, and had\nblurted out his words with a sudden, determined, and almost ferocious\nair,--as though he were going to demand the girl's hand, and\nchallenge all the household if it were refused him. But Lady Staveley\nunderstood his manner and his nature, and liked him almost the better\nfor his abruptness.\n\n\"She has spoken to me, Mr. Orme; she has told me of what passed\nbetween you on the last day that you were with us.\"\n\n\"And yet you are surprised that I should have gone! I wonder at that,\nLady Staveley. You must have known--\"\n\n\"Well; perhaps I did know; but sit down, Mr. Orme. I won't let you\nget up in that restless way, if we are to talk together. Tell me\nfrankly; what is it you think that I can do for you?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you can do anything;--but I thought I would come\nover and speak to you. I don't suppose I've any chance?\" He had\nseated himself far back on a sofa, and was holding his hat between\nhis knees, with his eyes fixed on the ground; but as he spoke the\nlast words he looked round into her face with an anxious inquiring\nglance which went direct to her heart.\n\n\"What can I say, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"Ah, no. Of course nothing. Good-bye, Lady Staveley. I might as well\ngo. I know that I was a fool for coming here. I knew it as I was\ncoming. Indeed I hardly meant to come in when I found myself at the\ngate.\"\n\n\"But you must not go from us like that.\"\n\n\"I must though. Do you think that I could go in and see her? If I did\nI should make such a fool of myself that I could never again hold up\nmy head. And I am a fool. I ought to have known that a fellow like me\ncould have no chance with her. I could knock my own head off, if I\nonly knew how, for having made such an ass of myself.\"\n\n\"No one here thinks so of you, Mr. Orme.\"\n\n\"No one here thinks what?\"\n\n\"That it was--unreasonable in you to propose to Madeline. We all know\nthat you did her much honour.\"\n\n\"Psha!\" said he, turning away from her.\n\n\"Ah! but you must listen to me. That is what we all think--Madeline\nherself, and I, and her father. No one who knows you could think\notherwise. We all like you, and know how good and excellent you are.\nAnd as to worldly station, of course you stand above her.\"\n\n\"Psha!\" he said again angrily. How could any one presume to talk of\nthe worldly station of his goddess? For just then Madeline Staveley\nto him was a goddess!\n\n\"That is what we think, indeed, Mr. Orme. As for myself, had my girl\ncome to me telling me that you had proposed to her, and telling me\nalso that--that--that she felt that she might probably like you, I\nshould have been very happy to hear it.\" And Lady Staveley as she\nspoke, put out her hand to him.\n\n\"But what did she say?\" asked Peregrine, altogether disregarding the\nhand.\n\n\"Ah, she did not say that. She told me that she had declined the\nhonour that you had offered her;--that she did not regard you as she\nmust regard the man to whom she would pledge her heart.\"\n\n\"But did she say that she could never love me?\" And now as he asked\nthe question he stood up again, looking down with all his eyes into\nLady Staveley's face,--that face which would have been so friendly to\nhim, so kind and so encouraging, had it been possible.\n\n\"Never is a long word, Mr. Orme.\"\n\n\"Ah, but did she say it? Come, Lady Staveley; I know I have been a\nfool, but I am not a cowardly fool. If it be so;--if I have no hope,\ntell me at once, that I may go away. In that case I shall be better\nanywhere out of the county.\"\n\n\"I cannot say that you should have no hope.\"\n\n\"You think then that there is a chance?\" and for a moment he looked\nas though all his troubles were nearly over.\n\n\"If you are so impetuous, Mr. Orme, I cannot speak to you. If you\nwill sit down for a minute or two I will tell you exactly what I\nthink about it.\" And then he sat down, trying to look as though he\nwere not impetuous. \"I should be deceiving you if I were not to tell\nyou that she speaks of the matter as though it were all over,--as\nthough her answer to you was a final one.\"\n\n\"Ah; I knew it was so.\"\n\n\"But then, Mr. Orme, many young ladies who have been at the first\nmoment quite as sure of their decision have married the gentlemen\nwhom they refused, and have learned to love them with all their\nhearts.\"\n\n\"But she isn't like other girls,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"I believe she is a great deal better than many, but nevertheless she\nmay be like others in that respect. I do not say that it will be so,\nMr. Orme. I would not on any account give you hopes which I believed\nto be false. But if you are anxious in the matter--\"\n\n\"I am as anxious about it as I am about my soul!\"\n\n\"Oh fie, Mr. Orme! You should not speak in that way. But if you are\nanxious, I would advise you to wait.\"\n\n\"And see her become the wife of some one else.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Mr. Orme. Madeline is very young. And so indeed are\nyou too;--almost too young to marry as yet, even if my girl were\nwilling that it should be so. But we all like you very much; and\nas you both are so very young, I think that you might wait with\npatience,--say for a year. Then come to Noningsby again, and try your\nfortune once more. That is my advice.\"\n\n\"Will you tell me one thing, Lady Staveley?\"\n\n\"What is that, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"Does she care for any one else?\"\n\nLady Staveley was prepared to do anything she could for her young\nfriend except to answer that question. She did believe that Madeline\ncared for somebody else,--cared very much. But she did not think that\nany way would be opened by which that caring would be made manifest;\nand she thought also that if wholly ungratified by any word of\nintercourse that feeling would die away. Could she have told\neverything to Peregrine Orme she would have explained to him that his\nbest chance lay in that liking for Felix Graham; or, rather, that as\nhis rejection had been caused by that liking, his chance would be\ngood again when that liking should have perished from starvation. But\nall this Lady Staveley could not explain to him; nor would it have\nbeen satisfactory to her feelings had it been in her power to do so.\nStill there remained the question, \"Does she care for any one else?\"\n\n\"Mr. Orme,\" she said, \"I will do all for you that a mother can do or\nought to do; but I must not admit that you have a right to ask such\na question as that. If I were to answer that now, you would feel\nyourself justified in asking it again when perhaps it might not be so\neasy to answer.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Lady Staveley;\" and Peregrine blushed up to his\neyes. \"I did not intend--\"\n\n\"No; do not beg my pardon, seeing that you have given me no offence.\nAs I said just now, all that a mother can and ought to do I will do\nfor you. I am very frank, and tell you that I should be rejoiced to\nhave you for my son-in-law.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm very much obliged to you.\"\n\n\"But neither by me nor by her father will any constraint ever be put\non the inclinations of our child. At any rate as to whom she will not\naccept she will always be allowed to judge for herself. I have told\nyou that to us you would be acceptable as a suitor; and after that\nI think it will be best to leave the matter for the present without\nany further words. Let it be understood that you will spend next\nChristmas at Noningsby, and then you will both be older and perhaps\nknow your own minds better.\"\n\n\"That's a year, you know.\"\n\n\"A year is not so very long--at your time of life.\" By which latter\nremark Lady Staveley did not show her knowledge of human nature.\n\n\"And I suppose I had better go now?\" said Peregrine sheepishly.\n\n\"If you like to go into the drawing-room, I'm sure they will all be\nvery glad to see you.\"\n\nBut Peregrine declared that he would not do this on any account. \"You\ndo not know, Lady Staveley, what a fool I should make myself. It\nwould be all over with me then.\"\n\n\"You should be more moderate in your feelings, Mr. Orme.\"\n\n\"It's all very well saying that; but you wouldn't be moderate if\nNoningsby were on fire, or if you thought the judge was going to\ndie.\"\n\n\"Good gracious, Mr. Orme!\"\n\n\"It's the same sort of thing to me, I can tell you. A man can't be\nmoderate when he feels that he should like to break his own neck. I\ndeclare I almost tried to do it to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Orme!\"\n\n\"Well; I did. But don't suppose I say that as a sort of threat. I'm\nsafe enough to live for the next sixty years. It's only the happy\npeople and those that are some good in the world that die. Good-bye,\nLady Staveley. I'll come back next Christmas;--that is if it isn't\nall settled before then; but I know it will be no good.\" Then he got\non his horse and rode very slowly home, along the high road to The\nCleeve.\n\nLady Staveley did not go in among the other ladies till luncheon was\nannounced, and when she did so, she said no word about her visitor.\nNevertheless it was known by them all that Peregrine Orme had been\nthere. \"Ah, that's Mr. Orme's roan-coloured horse,\" Sophia Furnival\nhad said, getting up and thrusting her face close to the drawing-room\nwindow. It was barely possible to see a portion of the road from the\ndrawing-room; but Sophia's eyes had been sharp enough to see that\nportion.\n\n\"A groom has probably come over with a note,\" said Mrs. Arbuthnot.\n\n\"Very likely,\" said Sophia. But they all knew from her voice that the\nrider was no groom, and that she did not intend it to be thought that\nhe was a groom. Madeline said not a word, and kept her countenance\nmarvellously; but she knew well enough that Peregrine had been with\nher mother; and guessed also why he had been there.\n\nMadeline had asked herself some serious questions, and had answered\nthem also, since that conversation which she had had with her father.\nHe had assured her that he desired only her happiness; and though in\nso saying he had spoken nothing of marriage, she had well understood\nthat he had referred to her future happiness,--at that time when by\nher own choice she should be leaving her father's house. And now\nshe asked herself boldly in what way might that happiness be best\nsecured. Hitherto she had refrained from any such home questions.\nLatterly, within the last week or two, ideas of what love meant had\nforced themselves upon her mind. How could it have been otherwise?\nBut she had never dared to tell herself either that she did love, or\nthat she did not. Mr. Orme had come to her with his offer, plainly\nasking her for the gift of her heart, and she had immediately been\naware that any such gift on her part was impossible,--any such gift\nin his favour. She had known without a moment's thought that there\nwas no room for hesitation. Had he asked her to take wings and fly\naway with him over the woods, the feat would not have been to her\nmore impossible than that of loving him as his wife. Yet she liked\nhim,--liked him much in these latter days, because he had been so\ngood to Felix Graham. When she felt that she liked him as she refused\nhim, she felt also that it was for this reason that she liked him.\nOn the day of Graham's accident she had thought nothing of him,--had\nhardly spoken to him. But now she loved him--with a sort of love,\nbecause he had been so good to Graham. Though in her heart she knew\nall this, she asked herself no questions till her father had spoken\nto her of her future happiness.\n\nThen, as she wandered about the house alone,--for she still went on\nwandering,--she did ask herself a question or two. What was it that\nhad changed her thus, and made her gay quick step so slow? what had\naltered the happy silver tone of her voice? what had created that\nload within her which seemed to weigh her down during every hour of\nthe day? She knew that there had been a change; that she was not as\nshe had been; and now she asked herself the question. Not on the\nfirst asking nor on the second did the answer come; not perhaps on\nthe twentieth. But the answer did come at last, and she told herself\nthat her heart was no longer her own. She knew and acknowledged to\nherself that Felix Graham was its master and owner.\n\nAnd then came the second question. Under those circumstances what had\nshe better do? Her mother had told her,--and the words had fallen\ndeep into her ears,--that it would be a great misfortune if she loved\nany man before she had reason to know that that man loved her. She\nhad no such knowledge as regarded Felix Graham. A suspicion that it\nmight be so she did feel,--a suspicion which would grow into a hope\nlet her struggle against it as she might. Baker, that injudicious\nBaker, had dropped in her hearing a word or two, which assisted this\nsuspicion. And then the open frank question put to her by her father\nwhen he demanded whether Graham had addressed her as a lover, had\ntended towards the same result. What had she better do? Of one thing\nshe now felt perfectly certain. Let the world go as it might in\nother respects, she could never leave her father's house as a bride\nunless the bridegroom were Felix Graham. A marriage with him might\nprobably be impracticable, but any other marriage would be absolutely\nimpossible. If her father or her mother told her not to think of\nFelix Graham, as a matter of course she would obey them; but not even\nin obedience to father or mother could she say that she loved any one\nelse.\n\nAnd now, all these matters having been considered, what should she\ndo? Her father had invited her to tell everything to him, and she was\npossessed by a feeling that in this matter she might possibly find\nmore indulgence with her father than with her mother; but yet it was\nmore natural that her mother should be her confidante and adviser.\nShe could speak to her mother, also, with a better courage, even\nthough she felt less certain of sympathy. Peregrine Orme had now been\nthere again, and had been closeted With Lady Staveley. On that ground\nshe would speak, and having so resolved she lost no time in carrying\nout her purpose.\n\n\"Mamma, Mr. Orme was here to-day; was he not?\"\n\n\"Yes, my love.\" Lady Staveley was sorry rather than otherwise that\nher daughter had asked her, but would have been puzzled to explain\nwhy such should have been the case.\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Madeline.\n\n\"He rode over, and told me among other things that the match between\nhis grandfather and Lady Mason is at an end. I was very glad to hear\nit, for I thought that Sir Peregrine was going to do a very foolish\nthing.\" And then there were a few further remarks on that subject,\nmade probably by Lady Staveley with some undefined intention of\ninducing her daughter to think that Peregrine Orme had come over\nchiefly on that matter.\n\n\"But, mamma--\"\n\n\"Well, my love.\"\n\n\"Did he say anything about--about what he was speaking to me about?\"\n\n\"Well, Madeline; he did. He did say something on that subject; but I\nhad not intended to tell you unless you had asked.\"\n\n\"I hope, mamma, he understands that what he wants can never\nhappen;--that is if he does want it now?\"\n\n\"He does want it certainly, my dear.\"\n\n\"Then I hope you told him that it can never be? I hope you did,\nmamma!\"\n\n\"But why should you be so certain about it, my love? He does not\nintend to trouble you with his suit,--nor do I. Why not leave that\nto time? There can be no reason why you should not see him again on\na friendly footing when this embarrassment between you shall have\npassed away.\"\n\n\"There would be no reason, mamma, if he were quite sure that there\ncould never be any other footing.\"\n\n\"Never is a very long word.\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Never is a very long word.\"]\n\n\"But it is the only true word, mamma. It would be wrong in you, it\nwould indeed, if you were to tell him to come again. I like Mr. Orme\nvery much as a friend, and I should be very glad to know him,--that\nis if he chose to know me.\" And Madeline as she made this little\nproviso was thinking what her own worldly position might be as the\nwife of Felix Graham. \"But as it is quite impossible that he and I\nshould ever be anything else to each other, he should not be asked to\ncome here with any other intention.\"\n\n\"But Madeline, I do not see that it is so impossible.\"\n\n\"Mamma, it is impossible; quite impossible!\" To this assertion\nLady Staveley made no answer in words, but there was that in her\ncountenance which made her daughter understand that she did not quite\nagree in this assertion, or understand this impossibility.\n\n\"Mamma, it is quite, quite impossible!\" Madeline repeated.\n\n\"But why so?\" said Lady Staveley, frightened by her daughter's\nmanner, and almost fearing that something further was to come which\nhad by far better be left unsaid.\n\n\"Because, mamma, I have no love to give him. Oh, mamma, do not be\nangry with me; do not push me away. You know who it is that I love.\nYou knew it before.\" And then she threw herself on her knees, and hid\nher face on her mother's lap.\n\nLady Staveley had known it, but up to that moment she had hoped that\nthat knowledge might have remained hidden as though it were unknown.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nMRS. FURNIVAL'S JOURNEY TO HAMWORTH.\n\n\nWhen Peregrine got back to The Cleeve he learned that there was a\nlady with his mother. He had by this time partially succeeded in\nreasoning himself out of his despondency. He had learned at any rate\nthat his proposition to marry into the Staveley family had been\nregarded with favour by all that family except the one whose views\non that subject were by far the most important to him; and he had\nlearned, as he thought, that Lady Staveley had no suspicion that her\ndaughter's heart was preoccupied. But in this respect Lady Staveley\nhad been too cunning for him. \"Wait!\" he said to himself as he went\nslowly along the road. \"It's all very well to say wait, but there\nare some things which won't bear waiting for. A man who waits never\ngets well away with the hounds.\" Nevertheless as he rode into the\ncourtyard his hopes were somewhat higher than they had been when he\nrode out of it.\n\n\"A lady! what lady? You don't mean Lady Mason?\"\n\nNo. The servant did not mean Lady Mason. It was an elderly stout lady\nwho had come in a fly, and the elderly stout lady was now in the\ndrawing-room with his mother. Lady Mason was still up stairs. We all\nknow who was that elderly stout lady, and we must now go back and say\na few words as to her journey from Orange Street to Hamworth.\n\nOn the preceding evening Mrs. Furnival had told Martha Biggs what was\nher intention; Or perhaps it would be more just to say that Martha\nBiggs had worked it out of her. Now that Mrs. Furnival had left the\nfashionable neighbourhood of Cavendish Square, and located herself in\nthat eastern homely district to which Miss Biggs had been so long\naccustomed, Miss Biggs had been almost tyrannical. It was not that\nshe was less attentive to her friend, or less willing to slave for\nher with a view to any possible or impossible result. But the friend\nof Mrs. Furnival's bosom could not help feeling her opportunity. Mrs.\nFurnival had now thrown herself very much upon her friend, and of\ncourse the friend now expected unlimited privileges;--as is always\nthe case with friends in such a position. It is very well to have\nfriends to lean upon, but it is not always well to lean upon one's\nfriends.\n\n\"I will be with you before you start in the morning,\" said Martha.\n\n\"It will not be at all necessary,\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"Oh, but I shall indeed. And, Kitty, I should think nothing of going\nwith you, if you would wish it. Indeed I think you should have a\nfemale friend alongside of you in such a trouble. You have only to\nsay the word and I'll go in a minute.\"\n\nMrs. Furnival however did not say the word, and Miss Biggs was\nobliged to deny herself the pleasure of the journey. But true to her\nword she came in the morning in ample time to catch Mrs. Furnival\nbefore she started, and for half an hour poured out sweet counsel\ninto her friend's ear. If one's friends would as a rule refrain from\naction how much more strongly would real friendship flourish in the\nworld!\n\n\"Now, Kitty, I do trust you will persist in seeing her.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm going there.\"\n\n\"Yes; but she might put you off it, if you're not firm. Of course\nshe'll deny herself if you send in your name first. What I should do\nwould be this;--to ask to be shown in to her and then follow the\nservant. When the happiness of a life is at stake,--the happinesses\nof two lives I may say, and perhaps the immortal welfare of one of\nthem in another world,--one must not stand too much upon etiquette.\nYou would never forgive yourself if you did. Your object is to save\nhim and to shame her out of her vile conduct. To shame her and\nfrighten her out of it if that be possible. Follow the servant in and\ndon't give them a moment to think. That's my advice.\"\n\nIn answer to all this Mrs. Furnival did not say much, and what little\nshe did say was neither in the affirmative nor in the negative.\nMartha knew that she was being ill treated, but not on that account\ndid she relax her friendly efforts. The time would soon come, if\nall things went well, when Mrs. Furnival would be driven by the\nloneliness of her position to open her heart in a truly loving and\nconfidential manner. Miss Biggs hoped sincerely that her friend and\nher friend's husband might be brought together again;--perhaps by\nher own efforts; but she did not anticipate,--or perhaps desire any\nspeedy termination of the present arrangements. It would be well\nthat Mr. Furnival should be punished by a separation of some months.\nThen, when he had learned to know what it was to have a home without\na \"presiding genius,\" he might, if duly penitent and open in his\nconfession, be forgiven. That was Miss Biggs's programme, and she\nthought it probable that Mrs. Furnival might want a good deal of\nconsolation before that day of open confession arrived.\n\n\"I shall go with you as far as the station, Kitty,\" she said in a\nvery decided voice.\n\n\"It will not be at all necessary,\" Mrs. Furnival replied.\n\n\"Oh, but I shall. You must want support at such a moment as this, and\nas far as I can give it you shall have it.\"\n\n\"But it won't be any support to have you in the cab with me. If you\nwill believe me, I had rather go alone. It is so necessary that I\nshould think about all this.\"\n\nBut Martha would not believe her; and as for thinking, she was quite\nready to take that part of the work herself. \"Don't say another\nword,\" she said, as she thrust herself in at the cab-door after her\nfriend. Mrs. Furnival hardly did say another word, but Martha Biggs\nsaid many. She knew that Mrs. Furnival was cross, ill pleased, and\nnot disposed to confidence. But what of that? Her duty as a friend\nwas not altered by Mrs. Furnival's ill humour. She would persevere,\nand having in her hands so great an opportunity, did not despair but\nwhat the time might come when both Mr. and Mrs. Furnival would with\nunited voices hail her as their preserver. Poor Martha Biggs! She did\nnot mean amiss; but she was troublesome.\n\nIt was very necessary that Mrs. Furnival should think over the step\nwhich she was taking. What was it that she intended to do when she\narrived at Hamworth? That plan of forcing her way into Lady Mason's\nhouse did not recommend itself to her the more in that it was\nrecommended by Martha Biggs. \"I suppose you will come up to us this\nevening?\" Martha said, when she left her friend in the railway\ncarriage. \"Not this evening, I think. I shall be so tired,\" Mrs.\nFurnival had replied. \"Then I shall come down to you,\" said Martha,\nalmost holloaing after her friend, as the train started. Mr. Furnival\nwould not have been displeased had he known the state of his wife's\nmind at that moment towards her late visitor. During the whole of her\njourney down to Hamworth she tried to think what she would say to\nLady Mason, but instead of so thinking her mind would revert to the\nunpleasantness of Miss Biggs's friendship.\n\nWhen she left the train at the Hamworth station she was solicited by\nthe driver of a public vehicle to use his fly, and having ascertained\nfrom the man that he well knew the position of Orley Farm, she got\ninto the carriage and had herself driven to the residence of her\nhated rival. She had often heard of Orley Farm, but she had never as\nyet seen it, and now felt considerable anxiety both as regards the\nhouse and its occupant.\n\n\"This is Orley Farm, ma'am,\" said the man, stopping at the gate.\n\"Shall I drive up?\"\n\nBut at this moment the gate was opened by a decent, respectable\nwoman,--Mrs. Furnival would not quite have called her a lady,--who\nlooked hard at the fly as it turned on to the private road.\n\n\"Perhaps this lady could tell me,\" said Mrs. Furnival, putting out\nher hand. \"Is this where Lady Mason lives?\"\n\nThe woman was Mrs. Dockwrath. On that day Samuel Dockwrath had gone\nto London, but before starting he had made known to his wife with\nfiendish glee that it had been at last decided by all the persons\nconcerned that Lady Mason should be charged with perjury, and tried\nfor that offence.\n\n\"You don't mean to say that the judges have said so?\" asked poor\nMiriam.\n\n\"I do mean to say that all the judges in England could not save her\nfrom having to stand her trial, and it is my belief that all the\nlawyers in the land cannot save her from conviction. I wonder whether\nshe ever thinks now of those fields which she took away from me!\"\n\nThen, when her master's back was turned, she put on her bonnet and\nwalked up to Orley Farm. She knew well that Lady Mason was at The\nCleeve, and believed that she was about to become the wife of Sir\nPeregrine; but she knew also that Lucius was at home, and it might\nbe well to let him know what was going on. She had just seen Lucius\nMason when she was met by Mrs. Furnival's fly. She had seen Lucius\nMason, and the angry manner in which he declared that he could in no\nway interfere in his mother's affairs had frightened her. \"But, Mr.\nLucius,\" she had said, \"she ought to be doing something, you know.\nThere is no believing how bitter Samuel is about it.\"\n\n\"He may be as bitter as he likes, Mrs. Dockwrath,\" young Mason had\nanswered with considerable dignity in his manner. \"It will not in the\nleast affect my mother's interests. In the present instance, however,\nI am not her adviser.\" Whereupon Mrs. Dockwrath had retired, and as\nshe was afraid to go to Lady Mason at The Cleeve, she was about to\nreturn home when she opened the gate for Mrs. Furnival. She then\nexplained that Lady Mason was not at home and had not been at home\nfor some weeks; that she was staying with her friends at The Cleeve,\nand that in order to get there Mrs. Furnival must go back through\nHamworth and round by the high road.\n\n\"I knows the way well enough, Mrs. Dockwrath,\" said the driver. \"I've\nbeen at The Cleeve before now, I guess.\"\n\nSo Mrs. Furnival was driven back to Hamworth, and on going over that\npiece of ground she resolved that she would follow Lady Mason to The\nCleeve. Why should she be afraid of Sir Peregrine Orme or of all the\nOrmes? Why should she fear any one while engaged in the performance\nof so sacred a duty? I must confess that in truth she was very much\nafraid, but nevertheless she had herself taken on to The Cleeve. When\nshe arrived at the door, she asked of course for Lady Mason, but did\nnot feel at all inclined to follow the servant uninvited into the\nhouse as recommended by Miss Biggs. Lady Mason, the man said, was\nnot very well, and after a certain amount of parley at the door the\nmatter ended in her being shown into the drawing-room, where she was\nsoon joined by Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"I am Mrs. Furnival,\" she began, and then Mrs. Orme begged her to sit\ndown. \"I have come here to see Lady Mason--on some business--some\nbusiness not of a very pleasant nature. I'm sure I don't know how to\ntrouble you with it, and yet--\" And then even Mrs. Orme could see\nthat her visitor was somewhat confused.\n\n\"Is it about the trial?\" asked Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Then there is really a lawsuit going on?\"\n\n\"A lawsuit!\" said Mrs. Orme, rather puzzled.\n\n\"You said something about a trial. Now, Mrs. Orme, pray do not\ndeceive me. I'm a very unhappy woman; I am indeed.\"\n\n\"Deceive you! Why should I deceive you?\"\n\n\"No, indeed. Why should you? And now I look at you I do not think you\nwill.\"\n\n\"Indeed I will not, Mrs. Furnival.\"\n\n\"And there is really a lawsuit then?\" Mrs. Furnival persisted in\nasking.\n\n\"I thought you would know all about it,\" said Mrs. Orme, \"as Mr.\nFurnival manages Lady Mason's law business. I thought that perhaps it\nwas about that that you had come.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Furnival explained that she knew nothing whatever about\nLady Mason's affairs, that hitherto she had not believed that there\nwas any trial or any lawsuit, and gradually explained the cause of\nall her trouble. She did not do this without sundry interruptions,\ncaused both by her own feelings and by Mrs. Orme's exclamations. But\nat last it all came forth; and before she had done she was calling\nher husband Tom, and appealing to her listener for sympathy.\n\n\"But indeed it's a mistake, Mrs. Furnival. It is indeed. There are\nreasons which make me quite sure of it.\" So spoke Mrs. Orme. How\ncould Lady Mason have been in love with Mr. Furnival,--if such a\nstate of things could be possible under any circumstances,--seeing\nthat she had been engaged to marry Sir Peregrine? Mrs. Orme did not\ndeclare her reasons, but repeated with very positive assurances her\nknowledge that Mrs. Furnival was labouring under some very grievous\nerror.\n\n\"But why should she always be at his chambers? I have seen her there\ntwice, Mrs. Orme. I have indeed;--with my own eyes.\"\n\nMrs. Orme would have thought nothing of it if Lady Mason had\nbeen seen there every day for a week together, and regarded Mrs.\nFurnival's suspicions as an hallucination bordering on insanity. A\nwoman be in love with Mr. Furnival! A very pretty woman endeavour\nto entice away from his wife the affection of such a man as that!\nAs these ideas passed through Mrs. Orme's mind she did not perhaps\nremember that Sir Peregrine, who was more than ten years Mr.\nFurnival's senior, had been engaged to marry the same lady. But then\nshe herself loved Sir Peregrine dearly, and she had no such feeling\nwith reference to Mr. Furnival. She however did what was most within\nher power to do to allay the suffering under which her visitor\nlaboured, and explained to her the position in which Lady Mason was\nplaced. \"I do not think she can see you,\" she ended by saying, \"for\nshe is in very great trouble.\"\n\n\"To be tried for perjury!\" said Mrs. Furnival, out of whose heart all\nhatred towards Lady Mason was quickly departing. Had she heard that\nshe was to be tried for murder,--that she had been convicted for\nmurder,--it would have altogether softened her heart towards her\nsupposed enemy. She could forgive her any offence but the one.\n\n\"Yes indeed,\" said Mrs. Orme, wiping a tear away from her eye as she\nthought of all the troubles present and to come. \"It is the saddest\nthing. Poor lady! It would almost break your heart if you were to see\nher. Since first she heard of this, which was before Christmas, she\nhas not had one quiet moment.\"\n\n\"Poor creature!\" said Mrs. Furnival.\n\n\"Ah, you would say so, if you knew all. She has had to depend a great\ndeal upon Mr. Furnival for advice, and without that I don't know\nwhat she would do.\" This Mrs. Orme said, not wishing to revert to\nthe charge against Lady Mason which had brought Mrs. Furnival down\nto Hamworth, but still desirous of emancipating her poor friend\ncompletely from that charge. \"And Sir Peregrine also is very kind\nto her,--very.\" This she added; feeling that up to that moment Mrs.\nFurnival could have heard nothing of the intended marriage, but\nthinking it probable that she must do so before long. \"Indeed anybody\nwould be kind to her who saw her in her suffering. I am sure you\nwould, Mrs. Furnival.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" said Mrs. Furnival who was beginning to entertain\nalmost a kindly feeling towards Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"It is such a dreadful position for a lady. Sometimes I think that\nher mind will fail her before the day comes.\"\n\n\"But what a very wicked man that other Mr. Mason must be!\" said Mrs.\nFurnival.\n\nThat was a view of the matter on which Mrs. Orme could not say much.\nShe disliked that Mr. Mason as much as she could dislike a man whom\nshe had never seen, but it was not open to her now to say that he was\nvery wicked in this matter. \"I suppose he thinks the property ought\nto belong to him,\" she answered.\n\n\"That was settled years ago,\" said Mrs. Furnival. \"Horrid, cruel man!\nBut after all I don't see why she should mind it so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Furnival!--to stand in a court and be tried.\"\n\n\"But if one is innocent! For my part, if I knew myself innocent I\ncould brave them all. It is the feeling that one is wrong that cows\none.\" And Mrs. Furnival thought of the little confession which she\nwould be called upon to make at home.\n\nAnd then feeling some difficulty as to her last words in such an\ninterview, Mrs. Furnival got up to go. \"Perhaps, Mrs. Orme,\" she\nsaid, \"I have been foolish in this.\"\n\n\"You have been mistaken, Mrs. Furnival. I am sure of that.\"\n\n\"I begin to think I have. But, Mrs. Orme, will you let me ask you\na favour? Perhaps you will not say anything about my coming here.\nI have been very unhappy; I have indeed; and--\" Mrs. Furnival's\nhandkerchief was now up at her eyes, and Mrs. Orme's heart was again\nfull of pity. Of course she gave the required promise; and, looking\nto the character of the woman, we may say that, of course, she kept\nit.\n\n\"Mrs. Furnival! What was she here about?\" Peregrine asked of his\nmother.\n\n\"I would rather not tell you, Perry,\" said his mother, kissing him;\nand then there were no more words spoken on the subject.\n\nMrs. Furnival as she made her journey back to London began to dislike\nMartha Biggs more and more, and most unjustly attributed to that lady\nin her thoughts the folly of this journey to Hamworth. The journey\nto Hamworth had been her own doing, and had the idea originated with\nMiss Biggs the journey would never have been made. As it was, while\nshe was yet in the train, she came to the strong resolution of\nreturning direct from the London station to her own house in Harley\nStreet. It would be best to cut the knot at once, and thus by a bold\nstroke of the knife rid herself of the Orange Street rooms and Miss\nBiggs at the same time. She did drive to Harley Street, and on her\narrival at her own door was informed by the astonished Spooner that,\n\"Master was at home,--all alone in the dining-room. He was going to\ndine at home, and seemed very lonely like.\" There, as she stood in\nthe hall, there was nothing but the door between her and her husband,\nand she conceived that the sound of her arrival must have been\nheard by him. For a moment her courage was weak, and she thought of\nhurrying up stairs. Had she done so her trouble would still have been\nall before her. Some idea of this came upon her mind, and after a\nmoment's pause, she opened the dining-room door and found herself\nin her husband's presence. He was sitting over the fire in his\narm-chair, very gloomily, and had not heard the arrival. He too had\nsome tenderness left in his heart, and this going away of his wife\nhad distressed him.\n\n\"Tom,\" she said, going up to him, and speaking in a low voice, \"I\nhave come back again.\" And she stood before him as a suppliant.\n\n[Illustration: \"Tom,\" she said, \"I have come back.\"]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nSHOWING HOW THINGS WENT ON AT NONINGSBY.\n\n\nYes, Lady Staveley had known it before. She had given a fairly\ncorrect guess at the state of her daughter's affections, though\nshe had not perhaps acknowledged to herself the intensity of her\ndaughter's feelings. But the fact might not have mattered if it had\nnever been told. Madeline might have overcome this love for Mr.\nGraham, and all might have been well if she had never mentioned\nit. But now the mischief was done. She had acknowledged to her\nmother,--and, which was perhaps worse, she had acknowledged to\nherself,--that her heart was gone, and Lady Staveley saw no cure for\nthe evil. Had this happened but a few hours earlier she would have\nspoken with much less of encouragement to Peregrine Orme.\n\nAnd Felix Graham was not only in the house, but was to remain there\nfor yet a while longer, spending a very considerable portion of his\ntime in the drawing-room. He was to come down on this very day at\nthree o'clock, after an early dinner, and on the next day he was\nto be promoted to the dining-room. As a son-in-law he was quite\nineligible. He had, as Lady Staveley understood, no private fortune,\nand he belonged to a profession which he would not follow in the only\nway by which it was possible to earn an income by it. Such being\nthe case, her daughter, whom of all girls she knew to be the most\nretiring, the least likely to speak of such feelings unless driven to\nit by great stress,--her daughter had positively declared to her that\nshe was in love with this man! Could anything be more hopeless? Could\nany position be more trying?\n\n\"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!\" she said, almost wringing her hands in\nher vexation,--\"No, my darling I am not angry,\" and she kissed her\nchild and smoothed her hair. \"I am not angry; but I must say I think\nit very unfortunate. He has not a shilling in the world.\"\n\n\"I will do nothing that you and papa do not approve,\" said Madeline,\nholding down her head.\n\n\"And then you know he doesn't think of such a thing himself--of\ncourse he does not. Indeed, I don't think he's a marrying man at\nall.\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma, do not talk in that way;--as if I expected anything. I\ncould not but tell you the truth when you spoke of Mr. Orme as you\ndid.\"\n\n\"Poor Mr. Orme! he is such an excellent young man.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose he's better than Mr. Graham, mamma, if you speak of\ngoodness.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Lady Staveley, very much put beside\nherself. \"I wish there were no such things as young men at all.\nThere's Augustus making a fool of himself.\" And she walked twice the\nlength of the room in an agony of maternal anxiety. Peregrine Orme\nhad suggested to her what she would feel if Noningsby were on fire;\nbut could any such fire be worse than these pernicious love flames?\nHe had also suggested another calamity, and as Lady Staveley\nremembered that, she acknowledged to herself that the Fates were not\nso cruel to her as they might have been. So she kissed her daughter,\nagain assured her that she was by no means angry with her, and then\nthey parted.\n\nThis trouble had now come to such a head that no course was any\nlonger open to poor Lady Staveley, but that one which she had adopted\nin all the troubles of her married life. She would tell the judge\neverything, and throw all the responsibility upon his back. Let him\ndecide whether a cold shoulder or a paternal blessing should be\nadministered to the ugly young man up stairs, who had tumbled off\nhis horse the first day he went out hunting, and who would not earn\nhis bread as others did, but thought himself cleverer than all the\nworld. The feelings in Lady Staveley's breast towards Mr. Graham at\nthis especial time were not of a kindly nature. She could not make\ncomparisons between him and Peregrine Orme without wondering at her\ndaughter's choice. Peregrine was fair and handsome, one of the\ncurled darlings of the nation, bright of eye and smooth of skin,\ngood-natured, of a sweet disposition, a young man to be loved by\nall the world, and--incidentally--the heir to a baronetcy and a\ngood estate. All his people were nice, and he lived close in the\nneighbourhood! Had Lady Staveley been set to choose a husband for\nher daughter she could have chosen none better. And then she counted\nup Felix Graham. His eyes no doubt were bright enough, but taken\naltogether he was,--at least so she said to herself--hideously ugly.\nHe was by no means a curled darling. And then he was masterful in\nmind, and not soft and pleasant as was young Orme. He was heir to\nnothing; and as to people of his own he had none in particular. Who\ncould say where he must live? As likely as not in Patagonia, having\nbeen forced to accept a judgeship in that new colony for the sake of\nbread. But her daughter should not go to Patagonia with him if she\ncould help it! So when the judge came home that evening, she told him\nall before she would allow him to dress for dinner.\n\n\"He certainly is not very handsome,\" the judge said, when Lady\nStaveley insisted somewhat strongly on that special feature of the\ncase.\n\n\"I think he is the ugliest young man I know,\" said her ladyship.\n\n\"He looks very well in his wig,\" said the judge.\n\n\"Wig! Madeline would not see him in a wig; nor anybody else very\noften, seeing the way he is going on about his profession. What are\nwe to do about it?\"\n\n\"Well. I should say, do nothing.\"\n\n\"And let him propose to the dear girl if he chooses to take the fancy\ninto his head?\"\n\n\"I don't see how we are to hinder him. But I have that impression of\nMr. Graham that I do not think he will do anything unhandsome by us.\nHe has some singular ideas of his own about law, and I grant you that\nhe is plain--\"\n\n\"The plainest young man I ever saw,\" said Lady Staveley.\n\n\"But, if I know him, he is a man of high character and much more than\nordinary acquirement.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand Madeline,\" Lady Staveley went on, not caring\novermuch about Felix Graham's acquirements.\n\n\"Well, my dear, I think the key to her choice is this, that she has\njudged not with her eyes, but with her ears, or rather with her\nunderstanding. Had she accepted Mr. Orme, I as a father should of\ncourse have been well satisfied. He is, I have no doubt, a fine young\nfellow, and will make a good husband some day.\"\n\n\"Oh, excellent!\" said her ladyship; \"and The Cleeve is only seven\nmiles.\"\n\n\"But I must acknowledge that I cannot feel angry with Madeline.\"\n\n\"Angry! no, not angry. Who would be angry with the poor child?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I am somewhat proud of her. It seems to me that she prefers\nmind to matter, which is a great deal to say for a young lady.\"\n\n\"Matter!\" exclaimed Lady Staveley, who could not but feel that the\nterm, as applied to such a young man as Peregrine Orme, was very\nopprobrious.\n\n\"Wit and intellect and power of expression have gone further with her\nthan good looks and rank and worldly prosperity. If that be so, and I\nbelieve it is, I cannot but love her the better for it.\"\n\n\"So do I love her, as much as any mother can love her daughter.\"\n\n\"Of course you do.\" And the judge kissed his wife.\n\n\"And I like wit and genius and all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Otherwise you would have not taken me, my dear.\"\n\n\"You were the handsomest man of your day. That's why I fell in love\nwith you.\"\n\n\"The compliment is a very poor one,\" said the judge.\n\n\"Never mind that. I like wit and genius too; but wit and genius are\nnone the better for being ugly; and wit and genius should know how to\nbutter their own bread before they think of taking a wife.\"\n\n\"You forget, my dear, that for aught we know wit and genius may be\nperfectly free from any such thought.\" And then the judge made it\nunderstood that if he were left to himself he would dress for dinner.\n\nWhen the ladies left the parlour that evening they found Graham\nin the drawing-room, but there was no longer any necessity for\nembarrassment on Madeline's part at meeting him. They had been in the\nroom together on three or four occasions, and therefore she could\ngive him her hand, and ask after his arm without feeling that every\none was watching her. But she hardly spoke to him beyond this, nor\nindeed did she speak much to anybody. The conversation, till the\ngentlemen joined them, was chiefly kept up by Sophia Furnival and\nMrs. Arbuthnot, and even after that the evening did not pass very\nbriskly.\n\nOne little scene there was, during which poor Lady Staveley's eyes\nwere anxiously fixed upon her son, though most of those in the room\nsupposed that she was sleeping. Miss Furnival was to return to\nLondon on the following day, and it therefore behoved Augustus to be\nvery sad. In truth he had been rather given to a melancholy humour\nduring the last day or two. Had Miss Furnival accepted all his civil\nspeeches, making him answers equally civil, the matter might very\nprobably have passed by without giving special trouble to any one.\nBut she had not done this, and therefore Augustus Staveley had\nfancied himself to be really in love with her. What the lady's\nintentions were I will not pretend to say; but if she was in truth\ndesirous of becoming Mrs. Staveley, she certainly went about her\nbusiness in a discreet and wise manner.\n\n\"So you leave us to-morrow, immediately after breakfast,\" said he,\nhaving dressed his face with that romantic sobriety which he had been\npractising for the last three days.\n\n\"I am sorry to say that such is the fact,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"To tell you the truth I am not sorry,\" said Augustus; and he turned\naway his face for a moment, giving a long sigh.\n\n\"I dare say not, Mr. Staveley; but you need not have said so to me,\"\nsaid Sophia, pretending to take him literally at his word.\n\n\"Because I cannot stand this kind of thing any longer. I suppose I\nmust not see you in the morning,--alone?\"\n\n\"Well, I suppose not. If I can get down to prayers after having all\nmy things packed up, it will be as much as I can do.\"\n\n\"And if I begged for half an hour as a last kindness--\"\n\n\"I certainly should not grant it. Go and ask your mother whether such\na request would be reasonable.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"Ah, but it's not psha! Half-hours between young ladies and young\ngentlemen before breakfast are very serious things.\"\n\n\"And I mean to be serious,\" said Augustus.\n\n\"But I don't,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"I am to understand then that under no possible circumstances--\"\n\n\"Bless me, Mr. Staveley, how solemn you are.\"\n\n\"There are occasions in a man's life when he is bound to be solemn.\nYou are going away from us, Miss Furnival--\"\n\n\"One would think I was going to Jeddo, whereas I am going to Harley\nStreet.\"\n\n\"And I may come and see you there!\"\n\n\"Of course you may if you like it. According to the usages of the\nworld you would be reckoned very uncivil if you did not. For myself I\ndo not much care about such usages, and therefore if you omit it I\nwill forgive you.\"\n\n\"Very well; then I will say good-night,--and good-bye.\" These last\nwords he uttered in a strain which should have melted her heart, and\nas he took leave of her he squeezed her hand with an affection that\nwas almost painful.\n\nIt may be remarked that if Augustus Staveley was quite in earnest\nwith Sophia Furnival, he would have asked her that all-important\nquestion in a straightforward manner as Peregrine Orme had asked it\nof Madeline. Perhaps Miss Furnival was aware of this, and, being so\naware, considered that a serious half-hour before breakfast might not\nas yet be safe. If he were really in love he would find his way to\nHarley Street. On the whole I am inclined to think that Miss Furnival\ndid understand her business.\n\nOn the following morning Miss Furnival went her way without any\nfurther scenes of tenderness, and Lady Staveley was thoroughly glad\nthat she was gone. \"A nasty, sly thing,\" she said to Baker. \"Sly\nenough, my lady,\" said Baker; \"but our Mr. Augustus will be one too\nmany for her. Deary me, to think of her having the imperance to think\nof him.\" In all which Miss Furnival was I think somewhat ill used.\nIf young gentlemen, such as Augustus Staveley, are allowed to amuse\nthemselves with young ladies, surely young ladies such as Miss\nFurnival should be allowed to play their own cards accordingly.\n\nOn that day, early in the morning, Felix Graham sought and obtained\nan interview with his host in the judge's own study. \"I have come\nabout two things,\" he said, taking the easy chair to which he was\ninvited.\n\n\"Two or ten, I shall be very happy,\" said the judge cheerily.\n\n\"I will take business first,\" said Graham.\n\n\"And then pleasure will be the sweeter afterwards,\" said the judge.\n\n\"I have been thinking a great deal about this case of Lady Mason's,\nand I have read all the papers, old and new, which Mr. Furnival has\nsent me. I cannot bring myself to suppose it possible that she can\nhave been guilty of any fraud or deception.\"\n\n\"I believe her to be free from all guilt in the matter--as I told you\nbefore. But then of course you will take that as a private opinion,\nnot as one legally formed. I have never gone into the matter as you\nhave done.\"\n\n\"I confess that I do not like having dealings with Mr. Chaffanbrass\nand Mr. Aram.\"\n\n\"Mr. Chaffanbrass and Mr. Aram may not be so bad as you, perhaps\nin ignorance, suppose them to be. Does it not occur to you that we\nshould be very badly off without such men as Chaffanbrass and Aram?\"\n\n\"So we should without chimney-sweepers and scavengers.\"\n\n\"Graham, my dear fellow, judge not that you be not judged. I am older\nthan you, and have seen more of these men. Believe me that as you\ngrow older and also see more of them, your opinion will be more\nlenient,--and more just. Do not be angry with me for taking this\nliberty with you.\"\n\n\"My dear judge, if you knew how I value it;--how I should value any\nmark of such kindness that you can show me! However I have decided\nthat I will know something more of these gentlemen at once. If I have\nyour approbation I will let Mr. Furnival know that I will undertake\nthe case.\"\n\nThe judge signified his approbation, and thus the first of those two\nmatters was soon settled between them.\n\n\"And now for the pleasure,\" said the judge.\n\n\"I don't know much about pleasure,\" said Graham, fidgeting in his\nchair, rather uneasily. \"I'm afraid there is not much pleasure for\neither of us, or for anybody else, in what I'm going to say.\"\n\n\"Then there is so much more reason for having it said quickly.\nUnpleasant things should always be got over without delay.\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth can exceed Lady Staveley's kindness to me, and\nyours, and that of the whole family since my unfortunate accident.\"\n\n\"Don't think of it. It has been nothing. We like you, but we should\nhave done as much as that even if we had not.\"\n\n\"And now I'm going to tell you that I have fallen in love with\nyour daughter Madeline.\" As the judge wished to have the tale told\nquickly, I think he had reason to be satisfied with the very succinct\nterms used by Felix Graham.\n\n\"Indeed!\" said the judge.\n\n\"And that was the reason why I wished to go away at the earliest\npossible time--and still wish it.\"\n\n\"You are right there, Mr. Graham. I must say you are right there.\nUnder all the circumstances of the case I think you were right to\nwish to leave us.\"\n\n\"And therefore I shall go the first thing to-morrow morning\"--in\nsaying which last words poor Felix could not refrain from showing a\ncertain unevenness of temper, and some disappointment.\n\n\"Gently, gently, Mr. Graham. Let us have a few more words before we\naccede to the necessity of anything so sudden. Have you spoken to\nMadeline on this subject?\"\n\n\"Not a word.\"\n\n\"And I may presume that you do not intend to do so.\"\n\nFor a moment or so Felix Graham sat without speaking, and then,\ngetting up from his chair, he walked twice the length of the room.\n\"Upon my word, judge, I will not answer for myself if I remain here,\"\nhe said at last.\n\nA softer-hearted man than Judge Staveley, or one who could make\nhimself more happy in making others happy, never sat on the English\nbench. Was not this a gallant young fellow before him,--gallant and\nclever, of good honest principles, and a true manly heart? Was he not\na gentleman by birth, education, and tastes? What more should a man\nwant for a son-in-law? And then his daughter had had the wit to love\nthis man so endowed. It was almost on his tongue to tell Graham that\nhe might go and seek the girl and plead his own cause to her.\n\nBut bread is bread, and butcher's bills are bills! The man and the\nfather, and the successful possessor of some thousands a year, was\ntoo strong at last for the soft-hearted philanthropist. Therefore,\nhaving collected his thoughts, he thus expressed himself upon the\noccasion:--\n\n\"Mr. Graham, I think you have behaved very well in this matter, and\nit is exactly what I should have expected from you.\" The judge at the\ntime knew nothing about Mary Snow. \"As regards yourself personally\nI should be proud to own you as my son-in-law, but I am of course\nbound to regard the welfare of my daughter. Your means I fear are but\nsmall.\"\n\n\"Very small indeed,\" said Graham.\n\n\"And though you have all those gifts which should bring you on in\nyour profession, you have learned to entertain ideas, which hitherto\nhave barred you from success. Now I tell you what you shall do.\nRemain here two or three days longer, till you are fit to travel,\nand abstain from saying anything to my daughter. Come to me again\nin three months, if you still hold the same mind, and I will pledge\nmyself to tell you then whether or no you have my leave to address my\nchild as a suitor.\"\n\nFelix Graham silently took the judge's hand, feeling that a strong\nhope had been given to him, and so the interview was ended.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nLADY MASON RETURNS HOME.\n\n\nLady Mason remained at The Cleeve for something more than a week\nafter that day on which she made her confession, during which time\nshe was fully committed to take her trial at the next assizes at\nAlston on an indictment for perjury. This was done in a manner that\nastonished even herself by the absence of all publicity or outward\nscandal. The matter was arranged between Mr. Matthew Round and Mr.\nSolomon Aram, and was so arranged in accordance with Mr. Furnival's\nwishes. Mr. Furnival wrote to say that at such a time he would call\nat The Cleeve with a post-chaise. This he did, and took Lady Mason\nwith him before two magistrates for the county who were sitting at\nDoddinghurst, a village five miles distant from Sir Peregrine's\nhouse. Here by agreement they were met by Lucius Mason who was\nto act as one of the bailsmen for his mother's appearance at the\ntrial. Sir Peregrine was the other, but it was brought about by\namicable management between the lawyers that his appearance before\nthe magistrates was not required. There were also there the two\nattorneys, Bridget Bolster the witness, one Torrington from London\nwho brought with him the absolute deed executed on that 14th of\nJuly with reference to the then dissolved partnership of Mason and\nMartock; and there was Mr. Samuel Dockwrath. I must not forget to say\nthat there was also a reporter for the press, provided by the special\ncare of the latter-named gentleman.\n\n[Illustration: Lady Mason going before the Magistrates.]\n\nThe arrival in the village of four different vehicles, and the sight\nof such gentlemen as Mr. Furnival, Mr. Round, and Mr. Aram, of course\naroused some excitement there; but this feeling was kept down as much\nas possible, and Lady Mason was very quickly allowed to return to the\ncarriage. Mr. Dockwrath made one or two attempts to get up a scene,\nand to rouse a feeling of public anger against the lady who was to be\ntried; but the magistrates put him down. They also seemed to be fully\nimpressed with a sense of Lady Mason's innocence in the teeth of the\nevidence which was given against her. This was the general feeling\non the minds of all people,--except of those who knew most about her.\nThere was an idea that affairs had so been managed by Mr. Joseph\nMason and Mr. Dockwrath that another trial was necessary, but that\nthe unfortunate victim of Mr. Mason's cupidity and Mr. Dockwrath's\nmalice would be washed white as snow when the day of that trial came.\nThe chief performers on the present occasion were Round and Aram, and\na stranger to such proceedings would have said that they were acting\nin concert. Mr. Round pressed for the indictment, and brought forward\nin a very short way the evidence of Bolster and Torrington. Mr. Aram\nsaid that his client was advised to reserve her defence, and was\nprepared with bail to any amount. Mr. Round advised the magistrates\nthat reasonable bail should be taken, and then the matter was\nsettled. Mr. Furnival sat on a chair close to the elder of those two\ngentlemen, and whispered a word to him now and then. Lady Mason was\nprovided with an arm-chair close to Mr. Furnival's right hand, and\nclose to her right hand stood her son. Her face was covered by a\ndeep veil, and she was not called upon during the whole proceeding\nto utter one audible word. A single question was put to her by the\npresiding magistrate before the committal was signed, and it was\nunderstood that some answer was made to it; but this answer reached\nthe ears of those in the room by means of Mr. Furnival's voice.\n\nIt was observed by most of those there that during the whole of the\nsitting Lady Mason held her son's hand; but it was observed also that\nthough Lucius permitted this he did not seem to return the pressure.\nHe stood there during the entire proceedings without motion or\nspeech, looking very stern. He signed the bail-bond, but even that\nhe did without saying a word. Mr. Dockwrath demanded that Lady Mason\nshould be kept in custody till the bond should also have been signed\nby Sir Peregrine; but upon this Mr. Round remarked that he believed\nMr. Joseph Mason had intrusted to him the conduct of the case, and\nthe elder magistrate desired Mr. Dockwrath to abstain from further\ninterference. \"All right,\" said he to a person standing close to\nhim. \"But I'll be too many for them yet, as you will see when she is\nbrought before a judge and jury.\" And then Lady Mason stood committed\nto take her trial at the next Alston assizes.\n\nWhen Lucius had come forward to hand her from the post-chaise in\nwhich she arrived Lady Mason had kissed him, but this was all\nthe intercourse that then passed between the mother and son. Mr.\nFurnival, however, informed him that his mother would return to Orley\nFarm on the next day but one.\n\n\"She thinks it better that she should be at home from this time to\nthe day of the trial,\" said Mr. Furnival; \"and on the whole Sir\nPeregrine is inclined to agree with her.\"\n\n\"I have thought so all through,\" said Lucius.\n\n\"But you are to understand that there is no disagreement between your\nmother and the family at The Cleeve. The idea of the marriage has, as\nI think very properly, been laid aside.\"\n\n\"Of course it was proper that it should be laid aside.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I must beg you to understand that there has been no\nquarrel. Indeed you will, I have no doubt, perceive that, as Mrs.\nOrme has assured me that she will see your mother constantly till the\ntime comes.\"\n\n\"She is very kind,\" said Lucius. But it was evident from the tone of\nhis voice that he would have preferred that all the Ormes should have\nremained away. In his mind this time of suffering to his mother and\nto him was a period of trial and probation,--a period, if not of\nactual disgrace, yet of disgrace before the world; and he thought\nthat it would have best become his mother to have abstained from\nall friendship out of her own family, and even from all expressed\nsympathy, till she had vindicated her own purity and innocence. And\nas he thought of this he declared to himself that he would have\nsacrificed everything to her comfort and assistance if she would only\nhave permitted it. He would have loved her, and been tender to her,\nreceiving on his own shoulders all those blows which now fell so\nhardly upon hers. Every word should have been a word of kindness;\nevery look should have been soft and full of affection. He would have\ntreated her not only with all the love which a son could show to a\nmother, but with all the respect and sympathy which a gentleman could\nfeel for a lady in distress. But then, in order that such a state\nof things as this should have existed, it would have been necessary\nthat she should have trusted him. She should have leaned upon him,\nand,--though he did not exactly say so in talking over the matter\nwith himself, still he thought it,--on him and on him only. But\nshe had declined to lean upon him at all. She had gone away to\nstrangers,--she, who should hardly have spoken to a stranger during\nthese sad months! She would not have his care; and under those\ncircumstances he could only stand aloof, hold up his head, and look\nsternly. As for her innocence, that was a matter of course. He knew\nthat she was innocent. He wanted no one to tell him that his own\nmother was not a thief, a forger, a castaway among the world's worst\nwretches. He thanked no one for such an assurance. Every honest man\nmust sympathise with a woman so injured. It would be a necessity\nof his manhood and of his honesty! But he would have valued most a\nsympathy which would have abstained from all expression till after\nthat trial should be over. It should have been for him to act and for\nhim to speak during this terrible period. But his mother who was a\nfree agent had willed it otherwise.\n\nAnd there had been one other scene. Mr. Furnival had introduced Lady\nMason to Mr. Solomon Aram, having explained to her that it would be\nindispensable that Mr. Aram should see her, probably once or twice\nbefore the trial came on.\n\n\"But cannot it be done through you?\" said Lady Mason. \"Though of\ncourse I should not expect that you can so sacrifice your valuable\ntime.\"\n\n\"Pray believe me that that is not the consideration,\" said Mr.\nFurnival. \"We have engaged the services of Mr. Aram because he is\nsupposed to understand difficulties of this sort better than any\nother man in the profession, and his chance of rescuing you from\nthis trouble will be much better if you can bring yourself to have\nconfidence in him--full confidence.\" And Mr. Furnival looked into\nher face as he spoke with an expression of countenance that was very\neloquent. \"You must not suppose that I shall not do all in my power.\nIn my proper capacity I shall be acting for you with all the energy\nthat I can use; but the case has now assumed an aspect which requires\nthat it should be in an attorney's hands.\" And then Mr. Furnival\nintroduced her to Mr. Solomon Aram.\n\nMr. Solomon Aram was not, in outward appearance, such a man as Lady\nMason, Sir Peregrine Orme, or others quite ignorant in such matters\nwould have expected. He was not a dirty old Jew with a hooked\nnose and an imperfect pronunciation of English consonants. Mr.\nChaffanbrass, the barrister, bore more resemblance to a Jew of that\nancient type. Mr. Solomon Aram was a good-looking man about forty,\nperhaps rather over-dressed, but bearing about him no other sign of\nvulgarity. Nor at first sight would it probably have been discerned\nthat he was of the Hebrew persuasion. He had black hair and a\nwell-formed face; but his eyes were closer than is common with most\nof us, and his nose seemed to be somewhat swollen about the bridge.\nWhen one knew that he was a Jew one saw that he was a Jew; but in the\nabsence of such previous knowledge he might have been taken for as\ngood a Christian as any other attorney.\n\nMr. Aram raised his hat and bowed as Mr. Furnival performed the\nceremony of introduction. This was done while she was still seated in\nthe carriage, and as Lucius was waiting at the door to hand her down\ninto the house where the magistrates were sitting. \"I am delighted to\nhave the honour of making your acquaintance,\" said Mr. Aram.\n\nLady Mason essayed to mutter some word; but no word was audible, nor\nwas any necessary. \"I have no doubt,\" continued the attorney, \"that\nwe shall pull through this little difficulty without any ultimate\ndamage whatsoever. In the mean time it is of course disagreeable to\na lady of your distinction.\" And then he made another bow. \"We are\npeculiarly happy in having such a tower of strength as Mr. Furnival,\"\nand then he bowed to the barrister.\n\n\"And my old friend Mr. Chaffanbrass is another tower of strength. Eh,\nMr. Furnival?\" And so the introduction was over.\n\nLady Mason had quite understood Mr. Furnival;--had understood both\nhis words and his face, when he told her how indispensable it was\nthat she should have full confidence in this attorney. He had meant\nthat she should tell him all. She must bring herself to confess\neverything to this absolute stranger. And then--for the first\ntime--she felt sure that Mr. Furnival had guessed her secret. He also\nknew it, but it would not suit him that any one should know that he\nknew it! Alas, alas! would it not be better that all the world should\nknow it and that there might be an end? Had not her doom been told to\nher? Even if the paraphernalia of justice,--the judge, and the jury,\nand the lawyers, could be induced to declare her innocent before all\nmen, must she not confess her guilt to him,--to that one,--for whose\nverdict alone she cared? If he knew her to be guilty what matter who\nmight think her innocent? And she had been told that all must be\ndeclared to him. That property was his,--but his only through her\nguilt; and that property must be restored to its owner! So much Sir\nPeregrine Orme had declared to be indispensable,--Sir Peregrine Orme,\nwho in other matters concerning this case was now dark enough in his\njudgment. On that point, however, there need be no darkness. Though\nthe heaven should fall on her devoted head, that tardy justice must\nbe done!\n\nWhen this piece of business had been completed at Doddinghurst, Lady\nMason returned to The Cleeve, whither Mr. Furnival accompanied her.\nHe had offered his seat in the post-chaise to Lucius, but the young\nman had declared that he was unwilling to go to The Cleeve, and\nconsequently there was no opportunity for conversation between Lady\nMason and her son. On her arrival she went at once to her room, and\nthere she continued to live as she had done for the last few days\ntill the morning of her departure came. To Mrs. Orme she told all\nthat had occurred, as Mr. Furnival did also to Sir Peregrine. On that\noccasion Sir Peregrine said very little to the barrister, merely\nbowing his head courteously as each different point was explained, in\nintimation of his having heard and understood what was said to him.\nMr. Furnival could not but see that his manner was entirely altered.\nThere was no enthusiasm now, no violence of invective against\nthat wretch at Groby Park, no positive assurance that his guest's\ninnocence must come out at the trial bright as the day! He showed no\ninclination to desert Lady Mason's cause, and indeed insisted on\nhearing the particulars of all that had been done; but he said very\nlittle, and those few words adverted to the terrible sadness of the\nsubject. He seemed too to be older than he had been, and less firm\nin his gait. That terrible sadness had already told greatly upon\nhim. Those about him had observed that he had not once crossed the\nthreshold of his hall door since the morning on which Lady Mason had\ntaken to her own room.\n\n\"He has altered his mind,\" said the lawyer to himself as he was\ndriven back to the Hamworth station. \"He also now believes her to be\nguilty.\" As to his own belief, Mr. Furnival held no argument within\nhis own breast, but we may say that he was no longer perplexed by\nmuch doubt upon the matter.\n\nAnd then the morning came for Lady Mason's departure. Sir Peregrine\nhad not seen her since she had left him in the library after her\nconfession, although, as may be remembered, he had undertaken to do\nso. But he had not then known how Mrs. Orme might act when she heard\nthe story. As matters had turned out Mrs. Orme had taken upon herself\nthe care of their guest, and all intercourse between Lady Mason and\nSir Peregrine had passed through his daughter-in-law. But now, on\nthis morning, he declared that he would go to her up stairs in Mrs.\nOrme's room, and himself hand her down through the hall into the\ncarriage. Against this Lady Mason had expostulated, but in vain.\n\n\"It will be better so, dear,\" Mrs. Orme had said. \"It will teach the\nservants and people to think that he still respects and esteems you.\"\n\n\"But he does not!\" said she, speaking almost sharply. \"How would it\nbe possible? Ah, me--respect and esteem are gone from me for ever!\"\n\n\"No, not for ever,\" replied Mrs. Orme. \"You have much to bear, but no\nevil lasts for ever.\"\n\n\"Will not sin last for ever;--sin such as mine?\"\n\n\"Not if you repent;--repent and make such restitution as is possible.\nLady Mason, say that you have repented. Tell me that you have asked\nHim to pardon you!\" And then, as had been so often the case during\nthese last days, Lady Mason sat silent, with hard, fixed eyes, with\nher hands clasped, and her lips compressed. Never as yet had Mrs.\nOrme induced her to say that she had asked for pardon at the cost of\ntelling her son that the property which he called his own had been\nprocured for him by his mother's fraud. That punishment, and that\nonly, was too heavy for her neck to bear. Her acquittal in the law\ncourt would be as nothing to her if it must be followed by an avowal\nof her guilt to her own son!\n\nSir Peregrine did come up stairs and handed her down through the hall\nas he had proposed. When he came into the room she did not look at\nhim, but stood leaning against the table, with her eyes fixed upon\nthe ground.\n\n\"I hope you find yourself better,\" he said, as he put out his hand to\nher. She did not even attempt to make a reply, but allowed him just\nto touch her fingers.\n\n\"Perhaps I had better not come down,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"It will be\neasier to say good-bye here.\"\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Lady Mason, and her voice sounded in Sir Peregrine's\nears like a voice from the dead.\n\n\"God bless you and preserve you,\" said Mrs. Orme, \"and restore you to\nyour son. God will bless you if you will ask Him. No; you shall not\ngo without a kiss.\" And she put out her arms that Lady Mason might\ncome to her.\n\nThe poor broken wretch stood for a moment as though trying to\ndetermine what she would do; and then, almost with a shriek, she\nthrew herself on to the bosom of the other woman, and burst into a\nflood of tears. She had intended to abstain from that embrace; she\nhad resolved that she would do so, declaring to herself that she was\nnot fit to be held against that pure heart; but the tenderness of the\noffer had overcome her; and now she pressed her friend convulsively\nin her arms, as though there might yet be comfort for her as long as\nshe could remain close to one who was so good to her.\n\n\"I shall come and see you very often,\" said Mrs. Orme,--\"almost\ndaily.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" exclaimed the other, hardly knowing the meaning of her\nown words.\n\n\"But I shall. My father is waiting now, dear, and you had better go.\"\n\nSir Peregrine had turned to the window, where he stood shading his\neyes with his hand. When he heard his daughter-in-law's last words he\nagain came forward, and offered Lady Mason his arm. \"Edith is right,\"\nhe said. \"You had better go now. When you are at home you will be\nmore composed.\" And then he led her forth, and down the stairs,\nand across the hall, and with infinite courtesy put her into the\ncarriage. It was a moment dreadful to Lady Mason; but to Sir\nPeregrine, also, it was not pleasant. The servants were standing\nround, officiously offering their aid,--those very servants who had\nbeen told about ten days since that this lady was to become their\nmaster's wife and their mistress. They had been told so with no\ninjunction as to secrecy, and the tidings had gone quickly through\nthe whole country. Now it was known that the match was broken off,\nthat the lady had been living up stairs secluded for the last week,\nand that she was to leave the house this morning, having been\ncommitted during the last day or two to stand her trial at the\nassizes for some terrible offence! He succeeded in his task. He\nhanded her into the carriage, and then walked back through his own\nservants to the library without betraying to them the depth of his\nsorrow; but he knew that the last task had been too heavy for him.\nWhen it was done he shut himself up and sat there for hours without\nmoving. He also declared to himself that the world was too hard for\nhim, and that it would be well for him that he should die. Never till\nnow had he come into close contact with crime, and now the criminal\nwas one whom as a woman he had learned to love, and whom he had\nproposed to the world as his wife! The criminal was one who had\ndeclared her crime in order to protect him, and whom therefore he was\nstill bound in honour to protect!\n\nWhen Lady Mason arrived at Orley Farm her son was waiting at the door\nto receive her. It should have been said that during the last two\ndays,--that is ever since the committal,--Mrs. Orme had urged upon\nher very strongly that it would be well for her to tell everything to\nher son. \"What! now, at once?\" the poor woman had said. \"Yes, dear,\nat once,\" Mrs. Orme had answered. \"He will forgive you, for I know he\nis good. He will forgive you, and then the worst of your sorrow will\nbe over.\" But towards doing this Lady Mason had made no progress even\nin her mind. In the violence of her own resolution she had brought\nherself to tell her guilt to Sir Peregrine. That effort had nearly\ndestroyed her, and now she knew that she could not frame the words\nwhich should declare the truth to Lucius. What; tell him the tale;\nwhereas her whole life had been spent in an effort to conceal it from\nhim? No. She knew that she could not do it. But the idea of doing so\nmade her tremble at the prospect of meeting him.\n\n\"I am very glad you have come home, mother,\" said Lucius, as he\nreceived her. \"Believe me that for the present this will be the best\nplace for both of us,\" and then he led her into the house.\n\n\"Dear Lucius, it would always be best for me to be with you, if it\nwere possible.\"\n\nHe did not accuse her of hypocrisy in saying this; but he could not\nbut think that had she really thought and felt as she now spoke\nnothing need have prevented her remaining with him. Had not his house\never been open to her? Had he not been willing to make her defence\nthe first object of his life? Had he not longed to prove himself a\ngood son? But she had gone from him directly that troubles came upon\nher, and now she said that she would fain be with him always--if it\nwere possible! Where had been the impediment? In what way had it been\nnot possible? He thought of this with bitterness as he followed her\ninto the house, but he said not a word of it. He had resolved that he\nwould be a pattern son, and even now he would not rebuke her.\n\nShe had lived in this house for some four-and-twenty years, but it\nseemed to her in no way like her home. Was it not the property of her\nenemy, Joseph Mason? and did she not know that it must go back into\nthat enemy's hands? How then could it be to her like a home? The room\nin which her bed was laid was that very room in which her sin had\nbeen committed. There in the silent hours of the night, while the\nold man lay near his death in the adjoining chamber, had she with\ninfinite care and much slow preparation done that deed, to undo\nwhich, were it possible, she would now give away her existence,--ay,\nher very body and soul. And yet for years she had slept in that room,\nif not happily at least tranquilly. It was matter of wonder to her\nnow, as she looked back at her past life, that her guilt had sat so\nlightly on her shoulders. The black unwelcome guest, the spectre\nof coming evil, had ever been present to her; but she had seen it\nindistinctly, and now and then the power had been hers to close her\neyes. Never again could she close them. Nearer to her, and still\nnearer, the spectre came; and now it sat upon her pillow, and put\nits claw upon her plate; it pressed upon her bosom with its fiendish\nstrength, telling her that all was over for her in this world:--ay,\nand telling her worse even than that. Her return to her old home\nbrought with it but little comfort.\n\nAnd yet she was forced to make an effort at seeming glad that she had\ncome there,--a terrible effort! He, her son, was not gay or disposed\nto receive from her a show of happiness; but he did think that she\nshould compose herself and be tranquil, and that she should resume\nthe ordinary duties of her life in her ordinarily quiet way. In\nall this she was obliged to conform herself to his wishes,--or to\nattempt so to conform herself, though her heart should break in the\nstruggle. If he did but know it all, then he would suffer her to be\nquiet,--suffer her to lie motionless in her misery! Once or twice she\nalmost said to herself that she would make the effort; but when she\nthought of him and his suffering, of his pride, of the respect which\nhe claimed from all the world as the honest son of an honest mother,\nof his stubborn will and stiff neck, which would not bend, but would\nbreak beneath the blow. She had done all for him,--to raise him in\nthe world; and now she could not bring herself to undo the work that\nhad cost her so dearly!\n\nThat evening she went through the ceremony of dinner with him, and he\nwas punctilious in waiting upon her as though bread and meat could\ncomfort her or wine could warm her heart. There was no warmth for her\nin all the vintages of the south, no comfort though gods should bring\nto her their banquets. She was heavy laden,--laden to the breaking of\nher back, and did not know where to lay her burden down.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said to her that night, lifting his head from the books\nover which he had been poring, \"There must be a few words between us\nabout this affair. They might as well be spoken now.\"\n\n\"Yes, Lucius; of course--if you desire it.\"\n\n\"There can be no doubt now that this trial will take place.\"\n\n\"No doubt;\" she said. \"There can be no doubt.\"\n\n\"Is it your wish that I should take any part in it?\"\n\nShe remained silent, for some moments before she answered him,\nthinking,--striving to think, how best she might do him pleasure.\n\"What part?\" she said at last.\n\n\"A man's part, and a son's part. Shall I see these lawyers and learn\nfrom them what they are at? Have I your leave to tell them that you\nwant no subterfuge, no legal quibbles,--that you stand firmly on your\nown clear innocence, and that you defy your enemies to sully it?\nMother, those who have sent you to such men as that cunning attorney\nhave sent you wrong,--have counselled you wrong.\"\n\n\"It cannot be changed now, Lucius.\"\n\n\"It can be changed, if you will tell me to change it.\"\n\nAnd then again she paused. Ah, think of her anguish as she sought for\nwords to answer him! \"No, Lucius,\" she said, \"it cannot be changed\nnow.\"\n\n\"So be it, mother; I will not ask again,\" and then he moodily\nreturned to his books, while she returned to her thoughts. Ah, think\nof her misery!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nTELLING ALL THAT HAPPENED BENEATH THE LAMP-POST.\n\n\nWhen Felix Graham left Noningsby and made his way up to London, he\ncame at least to one resolution which he intended to be an abiding\none. That idea of a marriage with a moulded wife should at any rate\nbe abandoned. Whether it might be his great destiny to be the husband\nof Madeline Staveley, or whether he might fail in achieving this\npurpose, he declared to himself that it would be impossible that he\nshould ever now become the husband of Mary Snow. And the ease with\nwhich his conscience settled itself on this matter as soon as he had\nreceived from the judge that gleam of hope astonished even himself.\nHe immediately declared to himself that he could not marry Mary Snow\nwithout perjury! How could he stand with her before the altar and\nswear that he would love her, seeing that he did not love her at\nall,--seeing that he altogether loved some one else? He acknowledged\nthat he had made an ass of himself in this affair of Mary Snow. This\nmoulding of a wife had failed with him, he said, as it always must\nfail with every man. But he would not carry his folly further.\nHe would go to Mary Snow, tell her the truth, and then bear\nwhatever injury her angry father might be able to inflict on him.\nIndependently of that angry father he would of course do for Mary\nSnow all that his circumstances would admit.\n\nPerhaps the gentleman of a poetic turn of mind whom Mary had\nconsented to meet beneath the lamp-post might assist him in his\nviews; but whether this might be so or not, he would not throw that\nmeeting ungenerously in her teeth. He would not have allowed that\noffence to turn him from his proposed marriage had there been nothing\nelse to turn him, and therefore he would not plead that offence as\nthe excuse for his broken troth. That the breaking of that troth\nwould not deeply wound poor Mary's heart--so much he did permit\nhimself to believe on the evidence of that lamp-post.\n\nHe had written to Mrs. Thomas telling her when he would be at\nPeckham, but in his letter he had not said a word as to those\nterrible tidings which she had communicated to him. He had written\nalso to Mary, assuring her that he accused her of no injury against\nhim, and almost promising her forgiveness; but this letter Mary had\nnot shown to Mrs. Thomas. In these days Mary's anger against Mrs.\nThomas was very strong. That Mrs. Thomas should have used all her\nvigilance to detect such goings on as those of the lamp-post was\nonly natural. What woman in Mrs. Thomas's position,--or in any other\nposition,--would not have done so? Mary Snow knew that had she\nherself been the duenna she would have left no corner of a box\nunturned but she would have found those letters. And having found\nthem she would have used her power over the poor girl. She knew\nthat. But she would not have betrayed her to the man. Truth between\nwoman and woman should have prevented that. Were not the stockings\nwhich she had darned for Mrs. Thomas legion in number? Had she not\nconsented to eat the veriest scraps of food in order that those three\nbrats might be fed into sleekness to satisfy their mother's eyes? Had\nshe not reported well of Mrs. Thomas to her lord, though that house\nof Peckham was nauseous to her? Had she ever told to Mr. Graham any\none of those little tricks which were carried on to allure him into a\nbelief that things at Peckham were prosperous? Had she ever exposed\nthe borrowing of those teacups when he came, and the fact that those\nknobs of white sugar were kept expressly on his behoof? No; she would\nhave scorned to betray any woman; and that woman whom she had not\nbetrayed should have shown the same feeling towards her. Therefore\nthere was enmity at Peckham, and the stockings of those infants lay\nunmended in the basket.\n\n\"Mary, I have done it all for the best,\" said Mrs. Thomas, driven to\ndefend herself by the obdurate silence of her pupil.\n\n\"No, Mrs. Thomas, you didn't. You did it for the worst,\" said Mary.\nAnd then there was again silence between them.\n\nIt was on the morning following this that Felix Graham was driven\nto the door in a cab. He still carried his arm in a sling, and was\nobliged to be somewhat slow in his movements, but otherwise he was\nagain well. His accident however was so far a godsend to both the\nwomen at Peckham that it gave them a subject on which they were\ncalled upon to speak, before that other subject was introduced. Mary\nwas very tender in her inquiries,--but tender in a bashful retiring\nway. To look at her one would have said that she was afraid to touch\nthe wounded man lest he should be again broken.\n\n\"Oh, I'm all right,\" said he, trying to assume a look of good-humour.\n\"I sha'n't go hunting again in a hurry; you may be sure of that.\"\n\n\"We have all great reason to be thankful that Providence interposed\nto save you,\" said Mrs. Thomas, in her most serious tone. Had\nProvidence interposed to break Mrs. Thomas's collar-bone, or at least\nto do her some serious outward injury, what a comfort it would be,\nthought Mary Snow.\n\n\"Have you seen your father lately?\" asked Graham.\n\n\"Not since I wrote to you about the money that he--borrowed,\" said\nMary.\n\n\"I told her that she should not have given it to him,\" said Mrs.\nThomas.\n\n\"She was quite right,\" said Graham. \"Who could refuse assistance to\na father in distress?\" Whereupon Mary put her handkerchief up to her\neyes and began to cry.\n\n\"That's true of course,\" said Mrs. Thomas; \"but it would never do\nthat he should be a drain in that way. He should feel that if he had\nany feeling.\"\n\n\"So he has,\" said Mary. \"And you are driven close enough yourself\nsometimes, Mrs. Thomas. There's days when you'd like to borrow\nnineteen and sixpence if anybody would lend it you.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Mrs. Thomas, crossing her hands over each other in\nher lap and assuming a look of resignation; \"I suppose all this will\nbe changed now. I have endeavoured to do my duty, and very hard it\nhas been.\"\n\nFelix felt that the sooner he rushed into the middle of the subject\nwhich brought him there, the better it would be for all parties. That\nthe two ladies were not very happy together was evident, and then he\nmade a little comparison between Madeline and Mary. Was it really\nthe case that for the last three years he had contemplated making\nthat poor child his wife? Would it not be better for him to tie a\nmillstone round his neck and cast himself into the sea? That was now\nhis thought respecting Mary Snow.\n\n\"Mrs. Thomas,\" he said, \"I should like to speak to Mary alone for a\nfew minutes if you could allow it.\"\n\n\"Oh certainly; by all means. It will be quite proper.\" And gathering\nup a bundle of the unfortunate stockings she took herself out of the\nroom.\n\nMary, as soon as Graham had spoken, became almost pale, and sat\nperfectly still with her eyes fixed on her betrothed husband. While\nMrs. Thomas was there she was prepared for war and her spirit was hot\nwithin her, but all that heat fled in a moment when she found herself\nalone with the man to whom it belonged to speak her doom. He had\nalmost said that he would forgive her, but yet she had a feeling that\nthat had been done which could not altogether be forgiven. If he\nasked her whether she loved the hero of the lamp-post what would she\nsay? Had he asked her whether she loved him, Felix Graham, she would\nhave sworn that she did, and have thought that she was swearing\ntruly; but in answer to that other question if it were asked, she\nfelt that her answer must be false. She had no idea of giving up\nFelix of her own accord, if he were still willing to take her. She\ndid not even wish that he would not take her. It had been the lesson\nof her life that she was to be his wife, and, by becoming so, provide\nfor herself and for her wretched father. Nevertheless a dream of\nsomething different from that had come across her young heart, and\nthe dream had been so pleasant! How painfully, but yet with what a\nrapture, had her heart palpitated as she stood for those ten wicked\nminutes beneath the lamp-post!\n\n\"Mary,\" said Felix, as soon as they were alone,--and as he spoke he\ncame up to her and took her hand, \"I trust that I may never be the\ncause to you of any unhappiness;--that I may never be the means of\nmaking you sad.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham, I am sure that you never will. It is I that have\nbeen bad to you.\"\n\n\"No, Mary, I do not think you have been bad at all. I should have\nbeen sorry that that had happened, and that I should not have known\nit.\"\n\n\"I suppose she was right to tell, only--\" In truth Mary did not at\nall understand what might be the nature of Graham's thoughts and\nfeelings on such a subject. She had a strong woman's idea that the\nman whom she ought to love would not be gratified by her meeting\nanother man at a private assignation, especially when that other man\nhad written to her a love-letter; but she did not at all know how far\nsuch a sin might be regarded as pardonable according to the rules of\nthe world recognised on such subjects. At first, when the letters\nwere discovered and the copies of them sent off to Noningsby, she\nthought that all was over. According to her ideas, as existing\nat that moment, the crime was conceived to be one admitting of\nno pardon; and in the hours spent under that conviction all her\nconsolation came from the feeling that there was still one who\nregarded her as an angel of light. But then she had received Graham's\nletter, and as she began to understand that pardon was possible, that\nother consolation waxed feeble and dim. If Felix Graham chose to take\nher, of course she was there for him to take. It never for a moment\noccurred to her that she could rebel against such taking, even though\nshe did shine as an angel of light to one dear pair of eyes.\n\n\"I suppose she was right to tell you, only--\"\n\n\"Do not think, Mary, that I am going to scold you, or even that I am\nangry with you.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I know you must be angry.\"\n\n\"Indeed I am not. If I pledge myself to tell you the truth in\neverything, will you be equally frank with me?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mary. But it was much easier for Felix to tell the truth\nthan for Mary to be frank. I believe that schoolmasters often tell\nfibs to schoolboys, although it would be so easy for them to tell the\ntruth. But how difficult it is for the schoolboy always to tell the\ntruth to his master! Mary Snow was now as a schoolboy before her\ntutor, and it may almost be said that the telling of the truth was\nto her impossible. But of course she made the promise. Who ever said\nthat she would not tell the truth when so asked?\n\n\"Have you ever thought, Mary, that you and I would not make each\nother happy if we were married?\"\n\n\"No; I have never thought that,\" said Mary innocently. She meant to\nsay exactly that which she thought Graham would wish her to say, but\nshe was slow in following his lead.\n\n\"It has never occurred to you that though we might love each other\nvery warmly as friends--and so I am sure we always shall--yet we\nmight not suit each other in all respects as man and wife?\"\n\n\"I mean to do the very best I can; that is, if--if--if you are not\ntoo much offended with me now.\"\n\n\"But, Mary, it should not be a question of doing the best you can.\nBetween man and wife there should be no need of such effort. It\nshould be a labour of love.\"\n\n\"So it will;--and I'm sure I'll labour as hard as I can.\"\n\nFelix began to perceive that the line he had taken would not answer\nthe required purpose, and that he must be somewhat more abrupt with\nher,--perhaps a little less delicate, in coming to the desired point.\n\"Mary,\" he said, \"what is the name of that gentleman whom--whom you\nmet out of doors you know?\"\n\n\"Albert Fitzallen,\" said Mary, hesitating very much as she pronounced\nthe name, but nevertheless rather proud of the sound.\n\n\"And you are--fond of him?\" asked Graham.\n\nPoor girl! What was she to say? \"No; I'm not very fond of him.\"\n\n\"Are you not? Then why did you consent to that secret meeting?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham--I didn't mean it; indeed I didn't. And I didn't tell\nhim to write to me, nor yet to come looking after me. Upon my word I\ndidn't. But then I thought when he sent me that letter that he didn't\nknow;--about you I mean; and so I thought I'd better tell him; and\nthat's why I went. Indeed that was the reason.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Thomas could have told him that.\"\n\n\"But I don't like Mrs. Thomas, and I wouldn't for worlds that she\nshould have had anything to do with it. I think Mrs. Thomas has\nbehaved very bad to me; so I do. And you don't half know her;--that\nyou don't.\"\n\n\"I will ask you one more question, Mary, and before answering it I\nwant to make you believe that my only object in asking it is to\nascertain how I may make you happy. When you did meet Mr.--this\ngentleman--\"\n\n\"Albert Fitzallen.\"\n\n\"When you did meet Mr. Fitzallen, did you tell him nothing else\nexcept that you were engaged to me? Did you say nothing to him as to\nyour feelings towards himself?\"\n\n\"I told him it was very wrong of him to write me that letter.\"\n\n\"And what more did you tell him?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham, I won't see him any more; indeed I won't. I give you\nmy most solemn promise. Indeed I won't. And I will never write a line\nto him,--or look at him. And if he sends anything I'll send it to\nyou. Indeed I will. There was never anything of the kind before; upon\nmy word there wasn't. I did let him take my hand, but I didn't know\nhow to help it when I was there. And he kissed me--only once. There;\nI've told it all now, as though you were looking at me. And I ain't a\nbad girl, whatever she may say of me. Indeed I ain't.\" And then poor\nMary Snow burst out into an agony of tears.\n\nFelix began to perceive that he had been too hard upon her. He had\nwished that the first overtures of a separation should come from her,\nand in wishing this he had been unreasonable. He walked for a while\nabout the room, and then going up to her he stood close by her and\ntook her hand. \"Mary,\" he said, \"I'm sure you're not a bad girl.\"\n\n\"No;\" she said, \"no, I ain't;\" still sobbing convulsively. \"I didn't\nmean anything wrong, and I couldn't help it.\"\n\n\"I am sure you did not, and nobody has said you did.\"\n\n\"Yes, they have. She has said so. She said that I was a bad girl. She\ntold me so, up to my face.\"\n\n\"She was very wrong if she said so.\"\n\n\"She did then, and I couldn't bear it.\"\n\n\"I have not said so, and I don't think so. Indeed in all this matter\nI believe that I have been more to blame than you.\"\n\n\"No;--I know I was wrong. I know I shouldn't have gone to see him.\"\n\n\"I won't even say as much as that, Mary. What you should have\ndone;--only the task would have been too hard for any young girl--was\nto have told me openly that you--liked this young gentleman.\"\n\n\"But I don't want ever to see him again.\"\n\n\"Look here, Mary,\" he said. But now he had dropped her hand and taken\na chair opposite to her. He had begun to find that the task which he\nhad proposed to himself was not so easy even for him. \"Look here,\nMary. I take it that you do like this young gentleman. Don't answer\nme till I have finished what I am going to say. I suppose you do like\nhim,--and if so it would be very wicked in you to marry me.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham--\"\n\n\"Wait a moment, Mary. But there is nothing wicked in your liking\nhim.\" It may be presumed that Mr. Graham would hold such an opinion\nas this, seeing that he had allowed himself the same latitude of\nliking. \"It was perhaps only natural that you should learn to do\nso. You have been taught to regard me rather as a master than as a\nlover.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham, I'm sure I've loved you. I have indeed. And I will.\nI won't even think of Al--\"\n\n\"But I want you to think of him,--that is if he be worth thinking\nof.\"\n\n\"He's a very good young man, and always lives with his mother.\"\n\n\"It shall be my business to find out that. And now Mary, tell me\ntruly. If he be a good young man, and if he loves you well enough to\nmarry you, would you not be happier as his wife than you would as\nmine?\"\n\nThere! The question that he wished to ask her had got itself asked at\nlast. But if the asking had been difficult, how much more difficult\nmust have been the answer! He had been thinking over all this for the\nlast fortnight, and had hardly known how to come to a resolution. Now\nhe put the matter before her without a moment's notice and expected\nan instant decision. \"Speak the truth, Mary;--what you think about\nit;--without minding what anybody may say of you.\" But Mary could not\nsay anything, so she again burst into tears.\n\n\"Surely you know the state of your own heart, Mary?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" she answered.\n\n\"My only object is to secure your happiness;--the happiness of both\nof us, that is.\"\n\n\"I'll do anything you please,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Well then, I'll tell you what I think. I fear that a marriage\nbetween us would not make either of us contented with our lives. I'm\ntoo old and too grave for you.\" Yet Mary Snow was not younger than\nMadeline Staveley. \"You have been told to love me; and you think that\nyou do love me because you wish to do what you think to be your duty.\nBut I believe that people can never really love each other merely\nbecause they are told to do so. Of course I cannot say what sort of\na young man Mr. Fitzallen may be; but if I find that he is fit to\ntake care of you, and that he has means to support you,--with such\nlittle help as I can give,--I shall be very happy to promote such an\narrangement.\"\n\nEverybody will of course say that Felix Graham was base in not\ntelling her that all this arose, not from her love affair with Albert\nFitzallen, but from his own love affair with Madeline Staveley. But\nI am inclined to think that everybody will be wrong. Had he told her\nopenly that he did not care for her, but did care for some one else,\nhe would have left her no alternative. As it was, he did not mean\nthat she should have any alternative. But he probably consulted her\nfeelings best in allowing her to think that she had a choice. And\nthen, though he owed much to her, he owed nothing to her father;\nand had he openly declared his intention of breaking off the match\nbecause he had attached himself to some one else, he would have put\nhimself terribly into her father's power. He was willing to submit to\nsuch pecuniary burden in the matter as his conscience told him that\nhe ought to bear; but Mr. Snow's ideas on the subject of recompense\nmight be extravagant; and therefore,--as regarded Snow the\nfather,--he thought that he might make some slight and delicate use\nof the meeting under the lamp-post. In doing so he would be very\ncareful to guard Mary from her father's anger. Indeed Mary would be\nsurrendered, out of his own care, not to that of her father, but to\nthe fostering love of the gentleman in the medical line of life.\n\n\"I'll do anything that you please,\" said Mary, upon whose mind and\nheart all these changes had come with a suddenness which prevented\nher from thinking,--much less speaking her thoughts.\n\n\"Perhaps you had better mention it to Mrs. Thomas.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Graham, I'd rather not talk to her. I don't love her a bit.\"\n\n\"Well, I will not press it on you if you do not wish it. And have I\nyour permission to speak to Mr. Fitzallen;--and if he approves to\nspeak to his mother?\"\n\n\"I'll do anything you think best, Mr. Graham,\" said poor Mary. She\nwas poor Mary; for though she had consented to meet a lover beneath\nthe lamp-post, she had not been without ambition, and had looked\nforward to the glory of being wife to such a man as Felix Graham. She\ndid not however, for one moment, entertain any idea of resistance to\nhis will.\n\nAnd then Felix left her, having of course an interview with Mrs.\nThomas before he quitted the house. To her, however, he said nothing.\n\"When anything is settled, Mrs. Thomas, I will let you know.\" The\nwords were so lacking in confidence that Mrs. Thomas when she heard\nthem knew that the verdict had gone against her.\n\nFelix for many months had been accustomed to take leave of Mary Snow\nwith a kiss. But on this day he omitted to kiss her, and then Mary\nknew that it was all over with her ambition. But love still remained\nto her. \"There is some one else who will be proud to kiss me,\" she\nsaid to herself, as she stood alone in the room when he closed the\ndoor behind him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nWHAT TOOK PLACE IN HARLEY STREET.\n\n\n\"Tom, I've come back again,\" said Mrs. Furnival, as soon as the\ndining-room door was closed behind her back.\n\n\"I'm very glad to see you; I am indeed,\" said he, getting up and\nputting out his hand to her. \"But I really never knew why you went\naway.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you know. I'm sure you know why I went. But--\"\n\n\"I'll be shot if I did then.\"\n\n\"I went away because I did not like Lady Mason going to your\nchambers.\"\n\n\"Psha!\"\n\n\"Yes; I know I was wrong, Tom. That is I was wrong--about that.\"\n\n\"Of course you were, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Well; don't I say I was? And I've come back again, and I beg your\npardon;--that is about the lady.\"\n\n\"Very well. Then there's an end of it.\"\n\n\"But Tom; you know I've been provoked. Haven't I now? How often have\nyou been home to dinner since you have been member of parliament for\nthat place?\"\n\n\"I shall be more at home now, Kitty.\"\n\n\"Shall you indeed? Then I'll not say another word to vex you. What on\nearth can I want, Tom, except just that you should sit at home with\nme sometimes on evenings, as you used to do always in the old days?\nAnd as for Martha Biggs--\"\n\n\"Is she come back too?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no. She's in Red Lion Square. And I'm sure, Tom, I never had\nher here except when you wouldn't dine at home. I wonder whether you\nknow how lonely it is to sit down to dinner all by oneself!\"\n\n\"Why; I do it every other day of my life. And I never think of\nsending for Martha Biggs; I promise you that.\"\n\n\"She isn't very nice, I know,\" said Mrs. Furnival--\"that is, for\ngentlemen.\"\n\n\"I should say not,\" said Mr. Furnival. Then the reconciliation had\nbeen effected, and Mrs. Furnival went up stairs to prepare for\ndinner, knowing that her husband would be present, and that Martha\nBiggs would not. And just as she was taking her accustomed place at\nthe head of the table, almost ashamed to look up lest she should\ncatch Spooner's eye who was standing behind his master, Rachel went\noff in a cab to Orange Street, commissioned to pay what might be due\nfor the lodgings, to bring back her mistress's boxes, and to convey\nthe necessary tidings to Miss Biggs.\n\n\"Well I never!\" said Martha, as she listened to Rachel's story.\n\n\"And they're quite loving I can assure you,\" said Rachel.\n\n\"It'll never last,\" said Miss Biggs triumphantly--\"never. It's been\ndone too sudden to last.\"\n\n\"So I'll say good-night if you please, Miss Biggs,\" said Rachel, who\nwas in a hurry to get back to Harley Street.\n\n\"I think she might have come here before she went there; especially\nas it wasn't anything out of her way. She couldn't have gone shorter\nthan Bloomsbury Square, and Russell Square, and over Tottenham Court\nRoad.\"\n\n\"Missus didn't think of that, I dare say.\"\n\n\"She used to know the way about these parts well enough. But give her\nmy love, Rachel.\" Then Martha Biggs was again alone, and she sighed\ndeeply.\n\nIt was well that Mrs. Furnival came back so quickly to her own house,\nas it saved the scandal of any domestic quarrel before her daughter.\nOn the following day Sophia returned, and as harmony was at that time\nreigning in Harley Street, there was no necessity that she should\nbe presumed to know anything of what had occurred. That she did\nknow,--know exactly what her mother had done, and why she had done\nit, and how she had come back, leaving Martha Biggs dumfounded by\nher return, is very probable, for Sophia Furnival was a clever girl,\nand one who professed to understand the ins and outs of her own\nfamily,--and perhaps of some other families. But she behaved very\nprettily to her papa and mamma on the occasion, never dropping a word\nwhich could lead either of them to suppose that she had interrogated\nRachel, been confidential with the housemaid, conversed on the\nsubject--even with Spooner, and made a morning call on Martha Biggs\nherself.\n\nThere arose not unnaturally some conversation between the mother\nand daughter as to Lady Mason;--not as to Lady Mason's visits to\nLincoln's Inn and their impropriety as formerly presumed;--not at\nall as to that; but in respect to her present lamentable position\nand that engagement which had for a time existed between her and Sir\nPeregrine Orme. On this latter subject Mrs. Furnival had of course\nheard nothing during her interview with Mrs. Orme at Noningsby. At\nthat time Lady Mason had formed the sole subject of conversation;\nbut in explaining to Mrs. Furnival that there certainly could be\nno unhallowed feeling between her husband and the lady, Mrs. Orme\nhad not thought it necessary to allude to Sir Peregrine's past\nintentions. Mrs. Furnival, however, had heard the whole matter\ndiscussed in the railway carriage, had since interrogated her\nhusband,--learning, however, not very much from him,--and now\ninquired into all the details from her daughter.\n\n\"And she and Sir Peregrine were really to be married?\" Mrs. Furnival,\nas she asked the question, thought with confusion of her own unjust\naccusations against the poor woman. Under such circumstances as\nthose Lady Mason must of course have been innocent as touching Mr.\nFurnival.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Sophia. \"There is no doubt whatsoever that they were\nengaged. Sir Peregrine told Lady Staveley so himself.\"\n\n\"And now it's all broken off again?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; it is all broken off now. I believe the fact to be this.\nLord Alston, who lives near Noningsby, is a very old friend of Sir\nPeregrine's. When he heard of it he went to The Cleeve--I know that\nfor certain;--and I think he talked Sir Peregrine out of it.\"\n\n\"But, my conscience, Sophia--after he had made her the offer!\"\n\n\"I fancy that Mrs. Orme arranged it all. Whether Lord Alston saw\nher or not I don't know. My belief is that Lady Mason behaved very\nwell all through, though they say very bitter things against her at\nNoningsby.\"\n\n\"Poor thing!\" said Mrs. Furnival, the feelings of whose heart were\nquite changed as regarded Lady Mason.\n\n\"I never knew a woman so badly treated.\" Sophia had her own reasons\nfor wishing to make the best of Lady Mason's case. \"And for myself\nI do not see why Sir Peregrine should not have married her if he\npleased.\"\n\n\"He is rather old, my dear.\"\n\n\"People don't think so much about that now-a-days as they used. If he\nliked it, and she too, who had a right to say anything? My idea is\nthat a man with any spirit would have turned Lord Alston out of the\nhouse. What business had he to interfere?\"\n\n\"But about the trial, Sophia?\"\n\n\"That will go on. There's no doubt about that. But they all say that\nit's the most unjust thing in the world, and that she must be proved\ninnocent. I heard the judge say so myself.\"\n\n\"But why are they allowed to try her then?\"\n\n\"Oh, papa will tell you that.\"\n\n\"I never like to bother your papa about law business.\" Particularly\nnot, Mrs. Furnival, when he has a pretty woman for his client!\n\n\"My wonder is that she should make herself so unhappy about it,\"\ncontinued Sophia. \"It seems that she is quite broken down.\"\n\n\"But won't she have to go and sit in the court,--with all the people\nstaring at her?\"\n\n\"That won't kill her,\" said Sophia, who felt that she herself would\nnot perish under any such process. \"If I was sure that I was in the\nright, I think that I could hold up my head against all that. But\nthey say that she is crushed to the earth.\"\n\n\"Poor thing!\" said Mrs. Furnival. \"I wish that I could do anything\nfor her.\" And in this way they talked the matter over very\ncomfortably.\n\nTwo or three days after this Sophia Furnival was sitting alone in the\ndrawing-room in Harley Street, when Spooner answered a double knock\nat the door, and Lucius Mason was shown up stairs. Mrs. Furnival had\ngone to make her peace in Red Lion Square, and there may perhaps\nbe ground for supposing that Lucius had cause to expect that Miss\nFurnival might be seen at this hour without interruption. Be that\nas it may, she was found alone, and he was permitted to declare his\npurpose unmolested by father, mother, or family friends.\n\n\"You remember how we parted at Noningsby,\" said he, when their first\ngreetings were well over.\n\n\"Oh, yes; I remember it very well. I do not easily forget words such\nas were spoken then.\"\n\n\"You said that you would never turn away from me.\"\n\n\"Nor will I;--that is with reference to the matter as to which we\nwere speaking.\"\n\n\"Is our friendship then to be confined to one subject?\"\n\n\"By no means. Friendship cannot be so confined, Mr. Mason. Friendship\nbetween true friends must extend to all the affairs of life. What I\nmeant to say was this-- But I am quite sure that you understand me\nwithout any explanation.\"\n\nHe did understand her. She meant to say that she had promised to\nhim her sympathy and friendship, but nothing more. But then he had\nasked for nothing more. The matter of doubt within his own heart was\nthis. Should he or should he not ask for more; and if he resolved\non answering this question in the affirmative, should he ask for it\nnow? He had determined that morning that he would come to some fixed\npurpose on this matter before he reached Harley Street. As he crossed\nout of Oxford Street from the omnibus he had determined that the\npresent was no time for love-making;--walking up Regent Street,\nhe had told himself that if he had one faithful heart to bear him\ncompany he could bear his troubles better;--as he made his way along\nthe north side of Cavendish Square he pictured to himself what would\nbe the wound to his pride if he were rejected;--and in passing the\nten or twelve houses which intervened in Harley Street between the\ncorner of the square and the abode of his mistress, he told himself\nthat the question must be answered by circumstances.\n\n\"Yes, I understand you,\" he said. \"And believe me in this--I would\nnot for worlds encroach on your kindness. I knew that when I pressed\nyour hand that night, I pressed the hand of a friend,--and nothing\nmore.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Sophia. Sophia's wit was usually ready enough, but\nat that moment she could not resolve with what words she might make\nthe most appropriate reply to her--friend. What she did say was\nrather lame, but it was not dangerous.\n\n\"Since that I have suffered a great deal,\" said Lucius. \"Of course\nyou know that my mother has been staying at The Cleeve?\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I believe she left it only a day or two since.\"\n\n\"And you heard perhaps of her--. I hardly know how to tell you, if\nyou have not heard it.\"\n\n\"If you mean about Sir Peregrine, I have heard of that.\"\n\n\"Of course you have. All the world has heard of it.\" And Lucius Mason\ngot up and walked about the room holding his hand to his brow. \"All\nthe world are talking about it. Miss Furnival, you have never known\nwhat it is to blush for a parent.\"\n\nMiss Furnival at the moment felt a sincere hope that Mr. Mason might\nnever hear of Mrs. Furnival's visit to the neighbourhood of Orange\nStreet and of the causes which led to it, and by no means thought\nit necessary to ask for her friend's sympathy on that subject. \"No,\"\nsaid she, \"I never have; nor need you do so for yours. Why should not\nLady Mason have married Sir Peregrine Orme, if they both thought such\na marriage fitting?\"\n\n\"What; at such a time as this; with these dreadful accusations\nrunning in her ears? Surely this was no time for marrying! And what\nhas come of it? People now say that he has rejected her and sent her\naway.\"\n\n\"Oh no. They cannot say that.\"\n\n\"But they do. It is reported that Sir Peregrine has sent her away\nbecause he thinks her to be guilty. That I do not believe. No honest\nman, no gentleman, could think her guilty. But is it not dreadful\nthat such things should be said?\"\n\n\"Will not the trial take place very shortly now? When that is once\nover all these troubles will be at an end.\"\n\n\"Miss Furnival, I sometimes think that my mother will hardly have\nstrength to sustain the trial. She is so depressed that I almost fear\nher mind will give way; and the worst of it is that I am altogether\nunable to comfort her.\"\n\n\"Surely that at present should specially be your task.\"\n\n\"I cannot do it. What should I say to her? I think that she is wrong\nin what she is doing; thoroughly, absolutely wrong. She has got about\nher a parcel of lawyers. I beg your pardon, Miss Furnival, but you\nknow I do not mean such as your father.\"\n\n\"But has not he advised it?\"\n\n\"If so I cannot but think he is wrong. They are the very scum of\nthe gaols; men who live by rescuing felons from the punishment they\ndeserve. What can my mother require of such services as theirs? It is\nthey that frighten her and make her dread all manner of evils. Why\nshould a woman who knows herself to be good and just fear anything\nthat the law can do to her?\"\n\n\"I can easily understand that such a position as hers must be very\ndreadful. You must not be hard upon her, Mr. Mason, because she is\nnot as strong as you might be.\"\n\n\"Hard upon her! Ah, Miss Furnival, you do not know me. If she would\nonly accept my love I would wait upon her as a mother does upon her\ninfant. No labour would be too much for me; no care would be too\nclose. But her desire is that this affair should never be mentioned\nbetween us. We are living now in the same house, and though I see\nthat this is killing her yet I may not speak of it.\" Then he got\nup from his chair, and as he walked about the room he took his\nhandkerchief from his pocket and wiped his eyes.\n\n\"I wish I could comfort you,\" said she. And in saying so she spoke\nthe truth. By nature she was not tender hearted, but now she did\nsympathise with him. By nature, too, she was not given to any deep\naffection, but she did feel some spark of love for Lucius Mason. \"I\nwish I could comfort you.\" And as she spoke she also got up from her\nchair.\n\n\"And you can,\" said he, suddenly stopping himself and coming close to\nher. \"You can comfort me,--in some degree. You and you only can do\nso. I know this is no time for declarations of love. Were it not that\nwe are already so much to each other, I would not indulge myself at\nsuch a moment with such a wish. But I have no one whom I can love;\nand--it is very hard to bear.\" And then he stood, waiting for her\nanswer, as though he conceived that he had offered her his hand.\n\nBut Miss Furnival well knew that she had received no offer. \"If my\nwarmest sympathy can be of service to you--\"\n\n\"It is your love I want,\" he said, taking her hand as he spoke. \"Your\nlove, so that I may look on you as my wife;--your acceptance of my\nlove, so that we may be all in all to each other. There is my hand.\nI stand before you now as sad a man as there is in all London. But\nthere is my hand--will you take it and give me yours in pledge of\nyour love.\"\n\nI should be unjust to Lucius Mason were I to omit to say that he\nplayed his part with a becoming air. Unhappiness and a melancholy\nmood suited him perhaps better than the world's ordinary good-humour.\nHe was a man who looked his best when under a cloud, and shone the\nbrightest when everything about him was dark. And Sophia also was not\nunequal to the occasion. There was, however, this difference between\nthem. Lucius was quite honest in all that he said and did upon the\noccasion; whereas Miss Furnival was only half honest. Perhaps she was\nnot capable of a higher pitch of honesty than that.\n\n\"There is my hand,\" said she; and they stood holding each other, palm\nto palm.\n\n\"And with it your heart?\" said Lucius.\n\n\"And with it my heart,\" answered Sophia. Nor as she spoke did she\nhesitate for a moment, or become embarrassed, or lose her command\nof feature. Had Augustus Staveley gone through the same ceremony at\nNoningsby in the same way I am inclined to think that she would have\nmade the same answer. Had neither done so, she would not on that\naccount have been unhappy. What a blessed woman would Lady Staveley\nhave been had she known what was being done in Harley Street at this\nmoment!\n\nIn some short rhapsody of love it may be presumed that Lucius\nindulged himself when he found that the affair which he had in hand\nhad so far satisfactorily arranged itself. But he was in truth\ntoo wretched at heart for any true enjoyment of the delights of\na favoured suitor. They were soon engaged again on that terrible\nsubject, seated side by side indeed and somewhat close, but the tone\nof their voices and their very words were hardly different from what\nthey might have been had no troth been plighted between them. His\npresent plan was that Sophia should visit Orley Farm for a time, and\ntake that place of dear and bosom friend which a woman circumstanced\nas was his mother must so urgently need. We, my readers, know well\nwho was now that loving friend, and we know also which was best\nfitted for such a task, Sophia Furnival or Mrs. Orme. But we have\nhad, I trust, better means of reading the characters of those ladies\nthan had fallen to the lot of Lucius Mason, and should not be angry\nwith him because his eyes were dark.\n\nSophia hesitated a moment before she answered this proposition,--not\nas though she were slack in her love, or begrudged her services to\nhis mother; but it behoved her to look carefully at the circumstances\nbefore she would pledge herself to such an arrangement as that. If\nshe went to Orley Farm on such a mission would it not be necessary\nto tell her father and mother,--nay, to tell all the world that she\nwas engaged to Lucius Mason; and would it be wise to make such a\ncommunication at the present moment? Lucius said a word to her of\ngoing into court with his mother, and sitting with her, hand in hand,\nwhile that ordeal was passing by. In the publicity of such sympathy\nthere was something that suited the bearings of Miss Furnival's mind,\nThe idea that Lady Mason was guilty had never entered her head, and\ntherefore, on this she thought there could be no disgrace in such a\nproceeding. But nevertheless--might it not be prudent to wait till\nthat trial were over?\n\n\"If you are my wife you must be her daughter; and how can you better\ntake a daughter's part?\" pleaded Lucius.\n\n\"No, no; and I would do it with my whole heart. But, Lucius, does she\nknow me well enough? It is of her that we must think. After all that\nyou have told me, can we think that she would wish me to be there?\"\n\nIt was his desire that his mother should learn to have such a wish,\nand this he explained to her. He himself could do but little at home\nbecause he could not yield his opinion on those matters of importance\nas to which he and his mother differed so vitally; but if she had a\nwoman with her in the house,--such a woman as his own Sophia,--then\nhe thought her heart would be softened and part of her sorrow might\nbe assuaged.\n\nSophia at last said that she would think about it. It would be\nimproper, she said, to pledge herself to anything rashly. It might be\nthat as her father was to defend Lady Mason, he might on that account\nobject to his daughter being in the court. Lucius declared that this\nwould be unreasonable,--unless indeed Mr. Furnival should object to\nhis daughter's engagement. And might he not do so? Sophia thought\nit very probable that he might. It would make no difference in her,\nshe said. Her engagement would be equally binding,--as permanently\nbinding, let who would object to it. And as she made this\ndeclaration, there was of course a little love scene. But, for the\npresent, it might be best that in this matter she should obey her\nfather. And then she pointed out how fatal it might be to avert her\nfather from the cause while the trial was still pending. Upon the\nwhole she acted her part very prudently, and when Lucius left her\nshe was pledged to nothing but that one simple fact of a marriage\nengagement.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nHOW SIR PEREGRINE DID BUSINESS WITH MR. ROUND.\n\n\nIn the mean time Sir Peregrine was sitting at home trying to\ndetermine in what way he should act under the present emergency,\nactuated as he was on one side by friendship and on the other by\nduty. For the first day or two--nay for the first week after the\nconfession had been made to him,--he had been so astounded, had\nbeen so knocked to the earth, and had remained in such a state of\nbewilderment, that it had been impossible for him to form for himself\nany line of conduct. His only counsellor had been Mrs. Orme; and,\nthough he could not analyze the matter, he felt that her woman's\nideas of honour and honesty were in some way different from his ideas\nas a man. To her the sorrows and utter misery of Lady Mason seemed of\ngreater weight than her guilt. At least such was the impression which\nher words left. Mrs. Orme's chief anxiety in the matter still was\nthat Lady Mason should be acquitted;--as strongly so now as when they\nboth believed her to be as guiltless as themselves. But Sir Peregrine\ncould not look at it in this light. He did not say that he wished\nthat she might be found guilty;--nor did he wish it. But he did\nannounce his opinion to his daughter-in-law that the ends of justice\nwould so be best promoted, and that if the matter were driven to a\ntrial it would not be for the honour of the court that a false\nverdict should be given. Nor would he believe that such a false\nverdict could be obtained. An English judge and an English jury were\nto him the Palladium of discerning truth. In an English court of law\nsuch a matter could not remain dark;--nor ought it, let whatever\nmisery betide. It was strange how that old man should have lived so\nnear the world for seventy years, should have taken his place in\nParliament and on the bench, should have rubbed his shoulders so\nconstantly against those of his neighbours, and yet have retained so\nstrong a reliance on the purity of the world in general. Here and\nthere such a man may still be found, but the number is becoming very\nfew.\n\nAs for the property, that must of necessity be abandoned. Lady Mason\nhad signified her agreement to this; and therefore he was so far\nwilling that she should be saved from further outward punishment, if\nthat were still possible. His plan was this; and to his thinking it\nwas the only plan that was feasible. Let the estate be at once given\nup to the proper owner,--even now, before the day of trial should\ncome; and then let them trust, not to Joseph Mason, but to Joseph\nMason's advisers to abstain from prosecuting the offender. Even this\ncourse he knew to be surrounded by a thousand difficulties; but it\nmight be possible. Of Mr. Round, old Mr. Round, he had heard a good\nreport. He was a kind man, and even in this very matter had behaved\nin a way that had shamed his client. Might it not be possible that\nMr. Round would engage to drop the prosecution if the immediate\nreturn of the property were secured? But to effect this must he not\ntell Mr. Round of the woman's guilt? And could he manage it himself?\nMust he not tell Mr. Furnival? And by so doing, would he not rob Lady\nMason of her sole remaining tower of strength?--for if Mr. Furnival\nknew that she was guilty, Mr. Furnival must of course abandon her\ncause. And then Sir Peregrine did not know how to turn himself, as he\nthus argued the matter within his own bosom.\n\nAnd then too his own disgrace sat very heavy on him. Whether or no\nthe law might pronounce Lady Mason to have been guilty, all the world\nwould know her guilt. When that property should be abandoned, and\nher wretched son turned out to earn his bread, it would be well\nunderstood that she had been guilty. And this was the woman, this\nmidnight forger, whom he had taken to his bosom, and asked to be\nhis wife! He had asked her, and she had consented, and then he had\nproclaimed the triumph of his love to all the world. When he stood\nthere holding her to his breast he had been proud of her affection.\nWhen Lord Alston had come to him with his caution he had scorned his\nold friend and almost driven him from his door. When his grandson had\nspoken a word, not to him but to another, he had been full of wrath.\nHe had let it be known widely that he would feel no shame in showing\nher to the world as Lady Orme. And now she was a forger, and a\nperjurer, and a thief;--a thief who for long years had lived on the\nproceeds of her dexterous theft. And yet was he not under a deep\nobligation to her--under the very deepest? Had she not saved him from\na worse disgrace;--saved him at the cost of all that was left to\nherself? Was he not still bound to stand by her? And did he not still\nlove her?\n\nPoor Sir Peregrine! May we not say that it would have been well for\nhim if the world and all its trouble could have now been ended so\nthat he might have done with it?\n\nMrs. Orme was his only counsellor, and though she could not be\nbrought to agree with him in all his feelings, yet she was of\ninfinite comfort to him. Had she not shared with him this terrible\nsecret his mind would have given way beneath the burden. On the day\nafter Lady Mason's departure from The Cleeve, he sat for an hour in\nthe library considering what he would do, and then he sent for his\ndaughter-in-law. If it behoved him to take any step to stay the\ntrial, he must take it at once. The matter had been pressed on by\neach side, and now the days might be counted up to that day on\nwhich the judges would arrive in Alston. That trial would be very\nterrible to him in every way. He had promised, during those pleasant\nhours of his love and sympathy in which he had felt no doubt as to\nhis friend's acquittal, that he would stand by her when she was\narraigned. That was now impossible, and though he had not dared to\nmention it to Lady Mason, he knew that she would not expect that he\nshould do so. But to Mrs. Orme he had spoken on the matter, and she\nhad declared her purpose of taking the place which it would not now\nbecome him to fill! Sir Peregrine had started from his chair when she\nhad so spoken. What! his daughter! She, the purest of the pure, to\nwhom the very air of a court of law would be a contamination;--she,\nwhose whiteness had never been sullied by contact with the world's\ndust; she set by the side of that terrible criminal, hand in hand\nwith her, present to all the world as her bosom friend! There had\nbeen but few words between them on the matter; but Sir Peregrine had\nfelt strongly that that might not be permitted. Far better than that\nit would be that he should humble his gray hairs and sit there to\nbe gazed at by the crowd. But on all accounts how much was it to be\ndesired that there should be no trial!\n\n\"Sit down, Edith,\" he said, as with her soft step she came up to him.\n\"I find that the assizes will be here, in Alston, at the end of next\nmonth.\"\n\n\"So soon as that, father?\"\n\n\"Yes; look here: the judges will come in on the 25th of March.\"\n\n\"Ah me--this is very sudden. But, father, will it not be best for her\nthat it should be over?\"\n\nMrs. Orme still thought, had always thought that the trial itself was\nunavoidable. Indeed she had thought and she did think that it\nafforded to Lady Mason the only possible means of escape. Her mind on\nthe subject, if it could have been analyzed, would probably have been\nthis. As to the property, that question must for the present stand\nin abeyance. It is quite right that it should go to its detestable\nowners,--that it should be made over to them at some day not very\ndistant. But for the present, the trial for that old, long-distant\ncrime was the subject for them to consider. Could it be wrong to wish\nfor an acquittal for the sinner,--an acquittal before this world's\nbar, seeing that a true verdict had undoubtedly been given before\nanother bar? Mrs. Orme trusted that no jury would convict her friend.\nLet Lady Mason go through that ordeal; and then, when the law had\ndeclared her innocent, let restitution be made.\n\n\"It will be very terrible to all if she be condemned,\" said Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"Very terrible! But Mr. Furnival--\"\n\n\"Edith, if it comes to that, she will be condemned. Mr. Furnival is a\nlawyer and will not say so; but from his countenance, when he speaks\nof her, I know that he expects it!\"\n\n\"Oh, father, do not say so.\"\n\n\"But if it is so--. My love, what is the purport of these courts of\nlaw if it be not to discover the truth, and make it plain to the\nlight of day?\" Poor Sir Peregrine! His innocence in this respect was\nperhaps beautiful, but it was very simple. Mr. Aram, could he have\nbeen induced to speak out his mind plainly, would have expressed,\nprobably, a different opinion.\n\n\"But she escaped before,\" said Mrs. Orme, who was clearly at present\non the same side with Mr. Aram.\n\n\"Yes; she did;--by perjury, Edith. And now the penalty of that\nfurther crime awaits her. There was an old poet who said that the\nwicked man rarely escapes at last. I believe in my heart that he\nspoke the truth.\"\n\n\"Father, that old poet knew nothing of our faith.\"\n\nSir Peregrine could not stop to explain, even if he knew how to do\nso, that the old poet spoke of punishment in this world, whereas the\nfaith on which his daughter relied is efficacious for pardon beyond\nthe grave. It would be much, ay, in one sense everything, if Lady\nMason could be brought to repent of the sin she had committed; but\nno such repentance would stay the bitterness of Joseph Mason or\nof Samuel Dockwrath. If the property were at once restored, then\nrepentance might commence. If the property were at once restored,\nthen the trial might be stayed. It might be possible that Mr. Round\nmight so act. He felt all this, but he could not argue on it. \"I\nthink, my dear,\" he said, \"that I had better see Mr. Round.\"\n\n\"But you will not tell him?\" said Mrs. Orme, sharply.\n\n\"No; I am not authorised to do that.\"\n\n\"But he will entice it from you! He is a lawyer, and he will wind\nanything out from a plain, chivalrous man of truth and honour.\"\n\n\"My dear, Mr. Round I believe is a good man.\"\n\n\"But if he asks you the question, what will you say?\"\n\n\"I will tell him to ask me no such question.\"\n\n\"Oh, father, be careful. For her sake be careful. How is it that you\nknow the truth;--or that I know it? She told it here because in that\nway only could she save you from that marriage. Father, she has\nsacrificed herself for--for us.\"\n\nSir Peregrine when this was said to him got up from his chair and\nwalked away to the window. He was not angry with her that she so\nspoke to him. Nay; he acknowledged inwardly the truth of her words,\nand loved her for her constancy. But nevertheless they were very\nbitter. How had it come to pass that he was thus indebted to so deep\na criminal? What had he done for her but good?\n\n\"Do not go from me,\" she said, following him. \"Do not think me\nunkind.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" he answered, striving almost ineffectually to repress a\nsob. \"You are not unkind.\"\n\nFor two days after that not a word was spoken between them on the\nsubject, and then he did go to Mr. Round. Not a word on the subject\nwas spoken between Sir Peregrine and Mrs. Orme; but she was twice at\nOrley Farm during the time, and told Lady Mason of the steps which\nher father-in-law was taking. \"He won't betray me!\" Lady Mason had\nsaid. Mrs. Orme had answered this with what best assurance she should\ngive; but in her heart of hearts she feared that Sir Peregrine would\nbetray the secret.\n\nIt was not a pleasant journey for Sir Peregrine. Indeed it may be\nsaid that no journeys could any longer be pleasant for him. He was\nold and worn and feeble; very much older and much more worn than he\nhad been at the period spoken of in the commencement of this story,\nthough but a few months had passed over his head since that time. For\nhim now it would have been preferable to remain in the arm-chair by\nthe fireside in his own library, receiving such comfort in his old\nage as might come to him from the affection of his daughter-in-law\nand grandson. But he thought that it behoved him to do this work; and\ntherefore, old and feeble as he was, he set himself to his task. He\nreached the station in London, had himself driven to Bedford Row in a\ncab, and soon found himself in the presence of Mr. Round.\n\n[Illustration: Sir Peregrine at Mr. Round's office.]\n\nThere was much ceremonial talk between them before Sir Peregrine\ncould bring himself to declare the purport which had brought him\nthere. Mr. Round of course protested that he was very sorry for all\nthis affair. The case was not in his hands personally. He had hoped\nmany years since that the matter was closed. His client, Mr. Mason of\nGroby Park, had insisted that it should be reopened; and now he, Mr.\nRound, really hardly knew what to say about it.\n\n\"But, Mr. Round, do you think it is quite impossible that the trial\nshould even now be abandoned?\" asked Sir Peregrine very carefully.\n\n\"Well, I fear it is. Mason thinks that the property is his, and is\ndetermined to make another struggle for it. I am imputing nothing\nwrong to the lady. I really am not in a position to have any opinion\nof my own--\"\n\n\"No, no, no; I understand. Of course your firm is bound to do the\nbest it can for its client. But, Mr. Round;--I know I am quite safe\nwith you.\"\n\n\"Well; safe in one way I hope you are. But, Sir Peregrine, you must\nof course remember that I am the attorney for the other side,--for\nthe side to which you are opposed.\"\n\n\"But still;--all that you can want is your client's interest.\"\n\n\"Of course we desire to serve his interest.\"\n\n\"And with that view, Mr. Round, is it not possible that we might come\nto some compromise?\"\n\n\"What;--by giving up part of the property?\"\n\n\"By giving up all the property,\" said Sir Peregrine, with\nconsiderable emphasis.\n\n\"Whew-w-w.\" Mr. Round at the moment made no other answer than this,\nwhich terminated in a low whistle.\n\n\"Better that, at once, than that she should die broken-hearted,\" said\nSir Peregrine.\n\nThere was then silence between them for a minute or two, after which\nMr. Round, turning himself round in his chair so as to face his\nvisitor more fully, spoke as follows. \"I told you just now, Sir\nPeregrine, that I was Mr. Mason's attorney, and I must now tell you,\nthat as regards this interview between you and me, I will not hold\nmyself as being in that position. What you have said shall be as\nthough it had not been said; and as I am not, myself, taking any part\nin the proceedings, this may with absolute strictness be the case.\nBut--\"\n\n\"If I have said anything that I ought not to have said--\" began Sir\nPeregrine.\n\n\"Allow me for one moment,\" continued Mr. Round. \"The fault is mine,\nif there be a fault, as I should have explained to you that the\nmatter could hardly be discussed with propriety between us.\"\n\n\"Mr. Round, I offer you my apology from the bottom of my heart.\"\n\n\"No, Sir Peregrine. You shall offer me no apology, nor will I accept\nany. I know no words strong enough to convey to you my esteem and\nrespect for your character.\"\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"But I will ask you to listen to me for a moment. If any compromise\nbe contemplated, it should be arranged by the advice of Mr. Furnival\nand of Mr. Chaffanbrass, and the terms should be settled between Mr.\nAram and my son. But I cannot myself say that I see any possibility\nof such a result. It is not however for me to advise. If on that\nmatter you wish for advice, I think that you had better see Mr.\nFurnival.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Sir Peregrine, telling more and more of the story by every\nutterance he made.\n\n\"And now it only remains for me to assure you once more that the\nwords which have been spoken in this room shall be as though they had\nnot been spoken.\" And then Mr. Round made it very clear that there\nwas nothing more to be said between them on the subject of Lady\nMason. Sir Peregrine repeated his apology, collected his hat and\ngloves, and with slow step made his way down to his cab, while Mr.\nRound absolutely waited upon him till he saw him seated within the\nvehicle.\n\n\"So Mat is right after all,\" said the old attorney to himself as he\nstood alone with his back to his own fire, thrusting his hands into\nhis trousers-pockets. \"So Mat is right after all!\" The meaning of\nthis exclamation will be plain to my readers. Mat had declared to\nhis father his conviction that Lady Mason had forged the codicil in\nquestion, and the father was now also convinced that she had done so.\n\"Unfortunate woman!\" he said; \"poor, wretched woman!\" And then he\nbegan to calculate what might yet be her chances of escape. On the\nwhole he thought that she would escape. \"Twenty years of possession,\"\nhe said to himself \"and so excellent a character!\" But, nevertheless,\nhe repeated to himself over and over again that she was a wretched,\nmiserable woman.\n\nWe may say that all the persons most concerned were convinced, or\nnearly convinced, of Lady Mason's guilt. Among her own friends Mr.\nFurnival had no doubt of it, and Mr. Chaffanbrass and Mr. Aram but\nvery little; whereas Sir Peregrine and Mrs. Orme of course had none.\nOn the other side Mr. Mason and Mr. Dockwrath were both fully sure of\nthe truth, and the two Rounds, father and son, were quite of the same\nmind. And yet, except with Dockwrath and Sir Peregrine, the most\nhonest and the most dishonest of the lot, the opinion was that she\nwould escape. These were five lawyers concerned, not one of whom gave\nto the course of justice credit that it would ascertain the truth,\nand not one of whom wished that the truth should be ascertained.\nSurely had they been honest-minded in their profession they would\nall have so wished;--have so wished, or else have abstained from all\nprofessional intercourse in the matter. I cannot understand how any\ngentleman can be willing to use his intellect for the propagation\nof untruth, and to be paid for so using it. As to Mr. Chaffanbrass\nand Mr. Solomon Aram,--to them the escape of a criminal under their\nauspices would of course be a matter of triumph. To such work\nfor many years had they applied their sharp intellects and legal\nknowledge. But of Mr. Furnival;--what shall we say of him?\n\nSir Peregrine went home very sad at heart, and crept silently back\ninto his own library. In the evening, when he was alone with Mrs.\nOrme, he spoke one word to her. \"Edith,\" he said, \"I have seen Mr.\nRound. We can do nothing for her there.\"\n\n\"I feared not,\" said she.\n\n\"No; we can do nothing for her there.\"\n\nAfter that Sir Peregrine took no step in the matter. What step could\nhe take? But he sat over his fire in his library, day after day,\nthinking over it all, and waiting till those terrible assizes should\nhave come.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nTHE LOVES AND HOPES OF ALBERT FITZALLEN.\n\n\nFelix Graham, when he left poor Mary Snow, did not go on immediately\nto the doctor's shop. He had made up his mind that Mary Snow should\nnever be his wife, and therefore considered it wise to lose no time\nin making such arrangements as might be necessary both for his\nrelease and for hers. But, nevertheless, he had not the heart to\ngo about the work the moment that he left her. He passed by the\napothecary's, and looking in saw a young man working sedulously at a\npestle. If Albert Fitzallen were fit to be her husband and willing\nto be so, poor as he was himself, he would still make some pecuniary\nsacrifice by which he might quiet his own conscience and make Mary's\nmarriage possible. He still had a sum of \u00c2\u00a31,200 belonging to him,\nthat being all his remaining capital; and the half of that he would\ngive to Mary as her dower. So in two days he returned, and again\nlooking in at the doctor's shop, again saw the young man at his work.\n\n\"Yes, sir, my name is Albert Fitzallen,\" said the medical aspirant,\ncoming round the counter. There was no one else in the shop, and\nFelix hardly knew how to accost him on so momentous a subject, while\nhe was still in charge of all that store of medicine, and liable\nto be called away at any moment to relieve the ailments of Clapham.\nAlbert Fitzallen was a pale-faced, light-haired youth, with an\nincipient moustache, with his hair parted in equal divisions over\nhis forehead, with elaborate shirt-cuffs elaborately turned back,\nand with a white apron tied round him so that he might pursue his\nvocation without injury to his nether garments. His face, however,\nwas not bad, nor mean, and had there not been about him a little air\nof pretension, assumed perhaps to carry off the combined apron and\nbeard, Felix would have regarded him altogether with favourable eyes.\n\n\"Is it in the medical way?\" asked Fitzallen, when Graham suggested\nthat he should step out with him for a few minutes. Graham explained\nthat it was not in the medical way,--that it was in a way altogether\nof a private nature; and then the young man, pulling off his apron\nand wiping his hands on a thoroughly medicated towel, invoked the\nmaster of the establishment from an inner room, and in a few minutes\nMary Snow's two lovers were walking together, side by side, along the\ncauseway.\n\n\"I believe you know Miss Snow,\" said Felix, rushing at once into the\nmiddle of all those delicate circumstances.\n\nAlbert Fitzallen drew himself up, and declared that he had that\nhonour.\n\n\"I also know her,\" said Felix. \"My name is Felix Graham--\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, very well,\" said Albert. The street in which they were\nstanding was desolate, and the young man was able to assume a look\nof decided hostility without encountering any other eyes than those\nof his rival. \"If you have anything to say to me, sir, I am quite\nprepared to listen to you--to listen to you, and to answer you. I\nhave heard your name mentioned by Miss Snow.\" And Albert Fitzallen\nstood his ground as though he were at once going to cover himself\nwith his pistol arm.\n\n\"Yes, I know you have. Mary has told me what has passed between you.\nYou may regard me, Mr. Fitzallen, as Mary's best and surest friend.\"\n\n\"I know you have been a friend to her; I am aware of that. But, Mr.\nGraham, if you will allow me to say so, friendship is one thing, and\nthe warm love of a devoted bosom is another.\"\n\n\"Quite so,\" said Felix.\n\n\"A woman's heart is a treasure not to be bought by any efforts of\nfriendship,\" said Fitzallen.\n\n\"I fully agree with you there,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Far be it from me to make any boast,\" continued the other, \"or even\nto hint that I have gained a place in that lady's affections. I know\nmy own position too well, and say proudly that I am existing only on\nhope.\" Here, to show his pride, he hit himself with his closed fist\non his shirt-front. \"But, Mr. Graham, I am free to declare, even in\nyour presence, though you may be her best and surest friend,\"--and\nthere was not wanting from the tone of his voice a strong flavour of\nscorn as he repeated these words--\"that I do exist on hope, let your\nclaims be what they will. If you desire to make such hope on my part\na cause of quarrel, I have nothing to say against it.\" And then he\ntwirled all that he could twirl of that incipient moustache.\n\n\"By no means,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Fitzallen. \"Then we understand that the arena\nof love is open to us both. I do not fail to appreciate the immense\nadvantages which you enjoy in this struggle.\" And then Fitzallen\nlooked up into Graham's ugly face, and thought of his own appearance\nin the looking-glass.\n\n\"What I want to know is this,\" said Felix. \"If you marry Mary Snow,\nwhat means have you of maintaining her? Would your mother receive her\ninto her house? I presume you are not a partner in that shop; but\nwould it be possible to get you in as a partner, supposing Mary were\nto marry you and had a little money as her fortune?\"\n\n\"Eh!\" said Albert, dropping his look of pride, allowing his hand to\nfall from his lips, and standing still before his companion with his\nmouth wide open.\n\n\"Of course you mean honestly by dear Mary.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, yes, on the honour of a gentleman. My intentions, sir,\nare--. Mr. Graham, I love that young lady with a devotion of heart,\nthat--that--that--. Then you don't mean to marry her yourself; eh,\nMr. Graham?\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Fitzallen, I do not. And now, if you will so far confide in\nme, we will talk over your prospects.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well. I'm sure you are very kind. But Miss Snow did tell\nme--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know she did, and she was quite right. But as you said just\nnow, a woman's heart cannot be bought by friendship. I have not been\na bad friend to Mary, but I had no right to expect that I could win\nher love in that way. Whether or no you may be able to succeed,\nI will not say, but I have abandoned the pursuit.\" In all which\nGraham intended to be exceedingly honest, but was, in truth, rather\nhypocritical.\n\n\"Then the course is open to me,\" said Fitzallen.\n\n\"Yes, the course is open,\" answered Graham.\n\n\"But the race has still to be run. Don't you think that Miss Snow is\nof her nature very--very cold?\"\n\nFelix remembered the one kiss beneath the lamp-post,--the one kiss\ngiven, and received. He remembered also that Mary's acquaintance with\nthe gentleman must necessarily have been short; and he made no answer\nto this question. But he made a comparison. What would Madeline have\nsaid and done had he attempted such an iniquity? And he thought of\nher flashing eyes and terrible scorn, of the utter indignation of all\nthe Staveley family, and of the wretched abyss into which the\noffender would have fallen.\n\nHe brought back the subject at once to the young man's means, to\nhis mother, and to the doctor's shop; and though he learned nothing\nthat was very promising, neither did he learn anything that was the\nreverse. Albert Fitzallen did not ride a very high horse when he\nlearned that his supposed rival was so anxious to assist him. He was\nquite willing to be guided by Graham, and, in that matter of the\nproposed partnership, was sure that old Balsam, the owner of the\nbusiness, would be glad to take a sum of money down. \"He has a son\nof his own,\" said Albert, \"but he don't take to it at all. He's gone\ninto wine and spirits; but he don't sell half as much as he drinks.\"\n\nFelix then proposed that he should call on Mrs. Fitzallen, and to\nthis Albert gave a blushing consent. \"Mother has heard of it,\" said\nAlbert, \"but I don't exactly know how.\" Perhaps Mrs. Fitzallen was as\nattentive as Mrs. Thomas had been to stray documents packed away in\nodd places. \"And I suppose I may call on--on--Mary?\" asked the lover,\nas Graham took his leave. But Felix could give no authority for this,\nand explained that Mrs. Thomas might be found to be a dragon still\nguarding the Hesperides. Would it not be better to wait till Mary's\nfather had been informed? and then, if all things went well, he might\nprosecute the affair in due form and as an acknowledged lover.\n\nAll this was very nice, and as it was quite unexpected, Fitzallen\ncould not but regard himself as a fortunate young man. He had never\ncontemplated the possibility of Mary Snow being an heiress. And when\nhis mother had spoken to him of the hopelessness of his passion, she\nhad suggested that he might perhaps marry his Mary in five or six\nyears. Now the dearest wish of his heart was brought close within\nhis reach, and he must have been a happy man. But yet, though this\ncertainly was so, nevertheless, there was a feeling of coldness about\nhis love, and almost of disappointment as he again took his place\nbehind the counter. The sorrows of Lydia in the play when she finds\nthat her passion meets with general approbation are very absurd\nbut, nevertheless, are quite true to nature. Lovers would be great\nlosers if the path of love were always to run smooth. Under such a\ndispensation, indeed, there would probably be no lovers. The matter\nwould be too tame. Albert did not probably bethink himself of a\nbecoming disguise, as did Lydia,--of an amiable ladder of ropes,\nof a conscious moon, or a Scotch parson; but he did feel, in some\nundefined manner, that the romance of his life had been taken away\nfrom him. Five minutes under a lamp-post with Mary Snow was sweeter\nto him than the promise of a whole bevy of evenings spent in the same\nsociety, with all the comforts of his mother's drawing-room around\nhim. Ah, yes, dear readers--my male readers of course I mean--were\nnot those minutes under the lamp-post always very pleasant?\n\nBut Graham encountered none of this feeling when he discussed the\nsame subject with Albert's mother. She was sufficiently alive to the\nmaterial view of the matter, and knew how much of a man's married\nhappiness depends on his supplies of bread and butter. Six hundred\npounds! Mr. Graham was very kind--very kind indeed. She hadn't a word\nto say against Mary Snow. She had seen her, and thought her very\npretty and modest looking. Albert was certainly warmly attached to\nthe young lady. Of that she was quite certain. And she would say this\nof Albert,--that a better-disposed young man did not exist anywhere.\nHe came home quite regular to his meals, and spent ten hours a day\nbehind the counter in Mr. Balsam's shop--ten hours a day, Sundays\nincluded, which Mrs. Fitzallen regarded as a great drawback to the\nmedical line--as should I also, most undoubtedly. But six hundred\npounds would make a great difference. Mrs. Fitzallen little doubted\nbut that sum would tempt Mr. Balsam into a partnership, or perhaps\nthe five hundred, leaving one hundred for furniture. In such a case\nAlbert would spend his Sundays at home, of course. After that, so\nmuch having been settled, Felix Graham got into an omnibus and took\nhimself back to his own chambers.\n\nSo far was so good. This idea of a model wife had already become a\nvery expensive idea, and in winding it up to its natural conclusion\npoor Graham was willing to spend almost every shilling that he could\ncall his own. But there was still another difficulty in his way. What\nwould Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re say? Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re was, he knew, a man with whom dealings\nwould be more difficult than with Albert Fitzallen. And then, seeing\nthat he had already promised to give his remaining possessions to\nAlbert Fitzallen, with what could he bribe Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re to abandon that\nnatural ambition to have a barrister for his son-in-law? In these\ndays, too, Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re had derogated even from the position in which\nGraham had first known him, and had become but little better than a\ndrunken, begging impostor. What a father-in-law to have had! And then\nFelix Graham thought of Judge Staveley.\n\nHe sent, however, to the engraver, and the man was not long in\nobeying the summons. In latter days Graham had not seen him\nfrequently, having bestowed his alms through Mary, and was shocked at\nthe unmistakable evidence of the gin-shop which the man's appearance\nand voice betrayed. How dreadful to the sight are those watery\neyes; that red, uneven, pimpled nose; those fallen cheeks; and that\nhanging, slobbered mouth! Look at the uncombed hair, the beard half\nshorn, the weak, impotent gait of the man, and the tattered raiment,\nall eloquent of gin! You would fain hold your nose when he comes nigh\nyou, he carries with him so foul an evidence of his only and his\nhourly indulgence. You would do so, had you not still a respect for\nhis feelings, which he himself has entirely forgotten to maintain.\nHow terrible is that absolute loss of all personal dignity which the\ndrunkard is obliged to undergo! And then his voice! Every tone has\nbeen formed by gin, and tells of the havoc which the compound has\nmade within his throat. I do not know whether such a man as this is\nnot the vilest thing which grovels on God's earth. There are women\nwhom we affect to scorn with the full power of our contempt; but I\ndoubt whether any woman sinks to a depth so low as that. She also may\nbe a drunkard, and as such may more nearly move our pity and affect\nour hearts, but I do not think she ever becomes so nauseous a thing\nas the man that has abandoned all the hopes of life for gin. You can\nstill touch her;--ay, and if the task be in one's way, can touch her\ngently, striving to bring her back to decency. But the other! Well,\none should be willing to touch him too, to make that attempt of\nbringing back upon him also. I can only say that the task is both\nnauseous and unpromising. Look at him as he stands there before the\nfoul, reeking, sloppy bar, with the glass in his hand, which he has\njust emptied. See the grimace with which he puts it down, as though\nthe dram had been almost too unpalatable. It is the last touch of\nhypocrisy with which he attempts to cover the offence;--as though\nhe were to say, \"I do it for my stomach's sake; but you know how\nI abhor it.\" Then he skulks sullenly away, speaking a word to no\none,--shuffling with his feet, shaking himself in his foul rags,\npressing himself into a heap--as though striving to drive the warmth\nof the spirit into his extremities! And there he stands lounging at\nthe corner of the street, till his short patience is exhausted, and\nhe returns with his last penny for the other glass. When that has\nbeen swallowed the policeman is his guardian.\n\nReader, such as you and I have come to that, when abandoned by the\nrespect which a man owes to himself. May God in his mercy watch over\nus and protect us both!\n\nSuch a man was Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re as he stood before Graham in his chambers in\nthe Temple. He could not ask him to sit down, so he himself stood up\nas he talked to him. At first the man was civil, twirling his old hat\nabout, and shifting from one foot to the other;--very civil, and also\nsomewhat timid, for he knew that he was half drunk at the moment. But\nwhen he began to ascertain what was Graham's object in sending for\nhim, and to understand that the gentleman before him did not propose\nto himself the honour of being his son-in-law, then his civility left\nhim, and, drunk as he was, he spoke out his mind with sufficient\nfreedom.\n\n\"You mean to say, Mr. Graham\"--and under the effect of gin he turned\nthe name into Gorm--\"that you are going to throw that young girl\nover?\"\n\n\"I mean to say no such thing. I shall do for her all that is in my\npower. And if that is not as much as she deserves, it will, at any\nrate, be more than you deserve for her.\"\n\n\"And you won't marry her?\"\n\n\"No; I shall not marry her. Nor does she wish it. I trust that she\nwill be engaged, with my full approbation--\"\n\n\"And what the deuce, sir, is your full approbation to me? Whose\nchild is she, I should like to know? Look here, Mr. Gorm; perhaps\nyou forget that you wrote me this letter when I allowed you to have\nthe charge of that young girl?\" And he took out from his breast a\nvery greasy pocket-book, and displayed to Felix his own much-worn\nletter,--holding it, however, at a distance, so that it should not\nbe torn from his hands by any sudden raid. \"Do you think, sir, I\nwould have given up my child if I didn't know she was to be married\nrespectable? My child is as dear to me as another man's.\"\n\n\"I hope she is. And you are a very lucky fellow to have her so well\nprovided for. I've told you all I've got to say, and now you may go.\"\n\n\"Mr. Gorm!\"\n\n\"I've nothing more to say; and if I had, I would not say it to you\nnow. Your child shall be taken care of.\"\n\n\"That's what I call pretty cool on the part of any gen'leman. And\nyou're to break your word,--a regular breach of promise, and nothing\nain't to come of it! I'll tell you what, Mr. Gorm, you'll find that\nsomething will come of it. What do you think I took this letter for?\"\n\n\"You took it, I hope, for Mary's protection.\"\n\n\"And by ---- she shall be protected.\"\n\n\"She shall, undoubtedly; but I fear not by you. For the present I\nwill protect her; and I hope that soon a husband will do so who will\nlove her. Now, Mr. Snow, I've told you all I've got to say, and I\nmust trouble you to leave me.\"\n\nNevertheless there were many more words between them before Graham\ncould find himself alone in his chambers. Though Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re might be\na thought tipsy--a sheet or so in the wind, as folks say, he was not\nmore tipsy than was customary with him, and knew pretty well what he\nwas about. \"And what am I to do with myself; Mr. Gorm?\" he asked in\na snivelling voice, when the idea began to strike him that it might\nperhaps be held by the courts of law that his intended son-in-law was\ndoing well by his daughter.\n\n\"Work,\" said Graham, turning upon him sharply and almost fiercely.\n\n\"That's all very well. It's very well to say 'Work!'\"\n\n\"You'll find it well to do it, too. Work, and don't drink. You hardly\nthink, I suppose, that if I had married your daughter I should have\nfound myself obliged to support you in idleness?\"\n\n\"It would have been a great comfort in my old age to have had a\ndaughter's house to go to,\" said Snow, na\u00c3\u00afvely, and now reduced to\nlachrymose distress.\n\nBut when he found that Felix would do nothing for him; that he would\nnot on the present occasion lend him a sovereign, or even half a\ncrown, he again became indignant and paternal, and in this state of\nmind was turned out of the room.\n\n\"Heaven and earth!\" said Felix to himself, clenching his hands and\nstriking the table with both of them at the same moment. That was the\nman with whom he had proposed to link himself in the closest ties\nof family connection. Albert Fitzallen did not know Mr. Snow; but\nit might be a question whether it would not be Graham's duty to\nintroduce them to each other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nMISS STAVELEY DECLINES TO EAT MINCED VEAL.\n\n\nThe house at Noningsby was now very quiet. All the visitors had gone,\nincluding even the Arbuthnots. Felix Graham and Sophia Furnival,\nthat terrible pair of guests, had relieved Mrs. Staveley of their\npresence; but, alas! the mischief they had done remained behind them.\nThe house was very quiet, for Augustus and the judge were up in town\nduring the greater part of the week, and Madeline and her mother were\nalone. The judge was to come back to Noningsby but once before he\ncommenced the circuit which was to terminate at Alston; and it seemed\nto be acknowledged now on all sides that nothing more of importance\nwas to be done or said in that locality until after Lady Mason's\ntrial.\n\nIt may be imagined that poor Madeline was not very happy. Felix had\ngone away, having made no sign, and she knew that her mother rejoiced\nthat he had so gone. She never accused her mother of cruelty, even\nwithin her own heart. She seemed to realise to herself the assurance\nthat a marriage with the man she loved was a happiness which she had\nno right to expect. She knew that her father was rich. She was aware\nthat in all probability her own fortune would be considerable. She\nwas quite sure that Felix Graham was clever and fit to make his way\nthrough the world. And yet she did not think it hard that she should\nbe separated from him. She acknowledged from the very first that he\nwas not the sort of man whom she ought to have loved, and therefore\nshe was prepared to submit.\n\nIt was, no doubt, the fact that Felix Graham had never whispered\nto her a word of love, and that therefore, on that ground, she had\nno excuse for hope. But, had that been all, she would not have\ndespaired. Had that been all, she might have doubted, but her doubt\nwould have been strongly mingled with the sweetness of hope. He had\nnever whispered a syllable of love, but she had heard the tone of his\nvoice as she spoke a word to him at his chamber door; she had seen\nhis eyes as they fell on her when he was lifted into the carriage;\nshe had felt the tremor of his touch on that evening when she walked\nup to him across the drawing-room and shook hands with him. Such a\ngirl as Madeline Staveley does not analyze her feelings on such a\nmatter, and then draw her conclusions. But a conclusion is drawn; the\nmind does receive an impression; and the conclusion and impression\nare as true as though they had been reached by the aid of logical\nreasoning. Had the match been such as her mother would have approved,\nshe would have had a hope as to Felix Graham's love--strong enough\nfor happiness.\n\nAs it was, there was no use in hoping; and therefore she\nresolved--having gone through much logical reasoning on this\nhead--that by her all ideas of love must be abandoned. As regarded\nherself, she must be content to rest by her mother's side as a flower\nungathered. That she could marry no man without the approval of her\nfather and mother was a thing to her quite certain; but it was, at\nany rate, as certain that she could marry no man without her own\napproval. Felix Graham was beyond her reach. That verdict she herself\npronounced, and to it she submitted. But Peregrine Orme was still\nmore distant from her;--Peregrine Orme, or any other of the curled\ndarlings who might come that way playing the part of a suitor.\nShe knew what she owed to her mother, but she also knew her own\nprivileges.\n\nThere was nothing said on the subject between the mother and\nchild during three days. Lady Staveley was more than ordinarily\naffectionate to her daughter, and in that way made known the thoughts\nwhich were oppressing her; but she did so in no other way. All\nthis Madeline understood, and thanked her mother with the sweetest\nsmiles and the most constant companionship. Nor was she, even\nnow, absolutely unhappy, or wretchedly miserable; as under such\ncircumstances would be the case with many girls. She knew all that\nshe was prepared to abandon, but she understood also how much\nremained to her. Her life was her own, and with her life the energy\nto use it. Her soul was free. And her heart, though burdened with\nlove, could endure its load without sinking. Let him go forth on his\ncareer. She would remain in the shade, and be contented while she\nwatched it.\n\nSo strictly wise and philosophically serene had Madeline become\nwithin a few days of Graham's departure, that she snubbed poor Mrs.\nBaker, when that good-natured and sharp-witted housekeeper said a\nword or two in praise of her late patient.\n\n\"We are very lonely, ain't we, miss, without Mr. Graham to look\nafter?\" said Mrs. Baker.\n\n\"I'm sure we are all very glad that he has so far recovered as to be\nable to be moved.\"\n\n\"That's in course,--though I still say that he went before he ought.\nHe was such a nice gentleman. Where there's one better, there's\ntwenty worse; and as full of cleverness as an egg's full of meat.\" In\nanswer to which Madeline said nothing.\n\n\"At any rate, Miss Madeline, you ought to say a word for him,\"\ncontinued Mrs. Baker; \"for he used to worship the sound of your\nvoice. I've known him lay there and listen, listen, listen, for your\nvery footfall.\"\n\n\"How can you talk such stuff, Mrs. Baker? You have never known\nanything of the kind--and even if he had, how could you know it? You\nshould not talk such nonsense to me, and I beg you won't again.\" Then\nshe went away, and began to read a paper about sick people written by\nFlorence Nightingale.\n\nBut it was by no means Lady Staveley's desire that her daughter\nshould take to the Florence Nightingale line of life. The charities\nof Noningsby were done on a large scale, in a quiet, handsome,\nmethodical manner, and were regarded by the mistress of the mansion\nas a very material part of her life's duty; but she would have been\ndriven distracted had she been told that a daughter of hers was\nabout to devote herself exclusively to charity. Her ideas of general\nreligion were the same. Morning and evening prayers, church twice\non Sundays, attendance at the Lord's table at any rate once a month,\nwere to herself--and in her estimation for her own family--essentials\nof life. And they had on her their practical effects. She was not\ngiven to backbiting--though, when stirred by any motive near to her\nown belongings, she would say an ill-natured word or two. She was\nmild and forbearing to her inferiors. Her hand was open to the poor.\nShe was devoted to her husband and her children. In no respect\nwas she self-seeking or self-indulgent. But, nevertheless, she\nappreciated thoroughly the comforts of a good income--for herself and\nfor her children. She liked to see nice-dressed and nice-mannered\npeople about her, preferring those whose fathers and mothers\nwere nice before them. She liked to go about in her own carriage,\ncomfortably. She liked the feeling that her husband was a judge, and\nthat he and she were therefore above other lawyers and other lawyers'\nwives. She would not like to have seen Mrs. Furnival walk out of a\nroom before her, nor perhaps to see Sophia Furnival when married take\nprecedence of her own married daughter. She liked to live in a large\nplace like Noningsby, and preferred country society to that of the\nneighbouring town.\n\nIt will be said that I have drawn an impossible character, and\ndepicted a woman who served both God and Mammon. To this accusation\nI will not plead, but will ask my accusers whether in their life's\ntravail they have met no such ladies as Lady Staveley?\n\nBut such as she was, whether good or bad, she had no desire whatever\nthat her daughter should withdraw herself from the world, and give\nup to sick women what was meant for mankind. Her idea of a woman's\nduties comprehended the birth, bringing up, education, and settlement\nin life of children, also due attendance upon a husband, with a close\nregard to his special taste in cookery. There was her granddaughter\nMarian. She was already thinking what sort of a wife she would make,\nand what commencements of education would best fit her to be a good\nmother. It is hardly too much to say that Marian's future children\nwere already a subject of care to her. Such being her disposition, it\nwas by no means matter of joy to her when she found that Madeline was\nlaying out for herself little ways of life, tending in some slight\ndegree to the monastic. Nothing was said about it, but she fancied\nthat Madeline had doffed a ribbon or two in her usual evening attire.\nThat she read during certain fixed hours in the morning was very\nmanifest. As to that daily afternoon service at four o'clock--she had\nvery often attended that, and it was hardly worthy of remark that\nshe now went to it every day. But there seemed at this time to be a\nmonotonous regularity about her visits to the poor, which told to\nLady Staveley's mind--she hardly knew what tale. She herself visited\nthe poor, seeing some of them almost daily. If it was foul weather\nthey came to her, and if it was fair weather she went to them. But\nMadeline, without saying a word to any one, had adopted a plan of\ngoing out exactly at the same hour with exactly the same object, in\nall sorts of weather. All this made Lady Staveley uneasy; and then,\nby way of counterpoise, she talked of balls, and offered Madeline\n_carte blanche_ as to a new dress for that special one which would\ngrace the assizes. \"I don't think I shall go,\" said Madeline; and\nthus Lady Staveley became really unhappy. Would not Felix Graham\nbe better than no son-in-law? When some one had once very strongly\npraised Florence Nightingale in Lady Staveley's presence, she had\nstoutly declared her opinion that it was a young woman's duty to get\nmarried. For myself, I am inclined to agree with her. Then came the\nsecond Friday after Graham's departure, and Lady Staveley observed,\nas she and her daughter sat at dinner alone, that Madeline would eat\nnothing but potatoes and sea-kale. \"My dear, you will be ill if you\ndon't eat some meat.\"\n\n\"Oh no, I shall not,\" said Madeline with her prettiest smile.\n\n\"But you always used to like minced veal.\"\n\n\"So I do, but I won't have any to-day, mamma, thank you.\"\n\nThen Lady Staveley resolved that she would tell the judge that Felix\nGraham, bad as he might be, might come there if he pleased. Even\nFelix Graham would be better than no son-in-law at all.\n\nOn the following day, the Saturday, the judge came down with\nAugustus, to spend his last Sunday at home before the beginning of\nhis circuit, and some little conversation respecting Felix Graham did\ntake place between him and his wife.\n\n\"If they are both really fond of each other, they had better marry,\"\nsaid the judge, curtly.\n\n\"But it is terrible to think of their having no income,\" said his\nwife.\n\n\"We must get them an income. You'll find that Graham will fall on his\nlegs at last.\"\n\n\"He's a very long time before he begins to use them,\" said Lady\nStaveley. \"And then you know The Cleeve is such a nice property, and\nMr. Orme is--\"\n\n\"But, my love, it seems that she does not like Mr. Orme.\"\n\n\"No, she doesn't,\" said the poor mother in a tone of voice that\nwas very lachrymose. \"But if she would only wait she might like\nhim,--might she not now? He is such a very handsome young man.\"\n\n\"If you ask me, I don't think his beauty will do it.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose she cares for that sort of thing,\" said Lady\nStaveley, almost crying. \"But I'm sure of this, if she were to go and\nmake a nun of herself, it would break my heart,--it would, indeed. I\nshould never hold up my head again.\"\n\nWhat could Lady Staveley's idea have been of the sorrows of some\nother mothers, whose daughters throw themselves away after a\ndifferent fashion?\n\nAfter lunch on Sunday the judge asked his daughter to walk with him,\nand on that occasion the second church service was abandoned. She got\non her bonnet and gloves, her walking-boots and winter shawl, and\nputting her arm happily and comfortably within his, started for what\nshe knew would be a long walk.\n\n\"We'll get as far as the bottom of Cleeve Hill,\" said the judge.\n\nNow the bottom of Cleeve Hill, by the path across the fields and the\ncommon, was five miles from Noningsby.\n\n\"Oh, as for that, I'll walk to the top if you like,\" said Madeline.\n\n\"If you do, my dear, you'll have to go up alone,\" said the judge. And\nso they started.\n\nThere was a crisp, sharp enjoyment attached to a long walk with her\nfather which Madeline always loved, and on the present occasion\nshe was willing to be very happy; but as she started, with her\narm beneath his, she feared she knew not what. She had a secret,\nand her father might touch upon it; she had a sore, though it was\nnot an unwholesome festering sore, and her father might probe the\nwound. There was, therefore, the slightest shade of hypocrisy in the\nalacrity with which she prepared herself, and in the pleasant tone of\nher voice as she walked down the avenue towards the gate.\n\nBut by the time that they had gone a mile, when their feet had left\nthe road and were pressing the grassy field-path, there was no longer\nany hypocrisy in her happiness. Madeline believed that no human being\ncould talk as did her father, and on this occasion he came out with\nhis freshest thoughts and his brightest wit. Nor did he, by any\nmeans, have the talk all to himself. The delight of Judge Staveley's\nconversation consisted chiefly in that--that though he might bring on\nto the carpet all the wit and all the information going, he rarely\nuttered much beyond his own share of words. And now they talked of\npictures and politics--of the new gallery that was not to be built at\nCharing Cross, and the great onslaught which was not to end in the\ndismissal of Ministers. And then they got to books--to novels, new\npoetry, magazines, essays, and reviews; and with the slightest touch\nof pleasant sarcasm the judge passed sentence on the latest efforts\nof his literary contemporaries. And thus at last they settled down on\na certain paper which had lately appeared in a certain Quarterly--a\npaper on a grave subject, which had been much discussed--and the\njudge on a sudden stayed his hand, and spared his raillery. \"You have\nnot heard, I suppose, who wrote that?\" said he. No; Madeline had not\nheard. She would much like to know. When young people begin their\nworld of reading there is nothing so pleasant to them as knowing the\nlittle secrets of literature; who wrote this and that, of which folk\nare then talking;--who manages this periodical, and puts the salt and\npepper into those reviews. The judge always knew these events of the\ninner literary world, and would communicate them freely to Madeline\nas they walked. No; there was no longer the slightest touch of\nhypocrisy in her pleasant manner and eager voice as she answered,\n\"No, papa, I have not heard. Was it Mr. So-and-so?\" and she named an\nephemeral literary giant of the day. \"No,\" said the judge, \"it was\nnot So-and-so; but yet you might guess, as you know the gentleman.\"\nThen the slight shade of hypocrisy came upon her again in a moment.\n\"She couldn't guess,\" she said; \"she didn't know.\" But as she thus\nspoke the tone of her voice was altered. \"That article,\" said the\njudge, \"was written by Felix Graham. It is uncommonly clever, and yet\nthere are a great many people who abuse it.\"\n\nAnd now all conversation was stopped. Poor Madeline, who had been so\nready with her questions, so eager with her answers, so communicative\nand so inquiring, was stricken dumb on the instant. She had ceased\nfor some time to lean upon his arm, and therefore he could not feel\nher hand tremble; and he was too generous and too kind to look into\nher face; but he knew that he had touched the fibres of her heart,\nand that all her presence of mind had for the moment fled from her.\nOf course such was the case, and of course he knew it. Had he not\nbrought her out there, that they might be alone together when he\nsubjected her to the violence of this shower-bath?\n\n\"Yes,\" he continued, \"that was written by our friend Graham. Do you\nremember, Madeline, the conversation which you and I had about him in\nthe library some time since?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"she remembered it.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" said the judge, \"and have thought much about it since.\nA very clever fellow is Felix Graham. There can be no doubt of that.\"\n\n\"Is he?\" said Madeline.\n\nI am inclined to think that the judge also had lost something of his\npresence of mind, or, at least, of his usual power of conversation.\nHe had brought his daughter out there with the express purpose of\nsaying to her a special word or two; he had beat very wide about the\nbush with the view of mentioning a certain name; and now that his\ndaughter was there, and the name had been mentioned, it seemed that\nhe hardly knew how to proceed.\n\n\"Yes, he is clever enough,\" repeated the judge, \"clever enough; and\nof high principles and an honest purpose. The fault which people find\nwith him is this,--that he is not practical. He won't take the world\nas he finds it. If he can mend it, well and good; we all ought to do\nsomething to mend it; but while we are mending it we must live in\nit.\"\n\n\"Yes, we must live in it,\" said Madeline, who hardly knew at the\nmoment whether it would be better to live or die in it. Had her\nfather remarked that they must all take wings and fly to heaven, she\nwould have assented.\n\nThen the judge walked on a few paces in silence, bethinking himself\nthat he might as well speak out at once the words which he had to\nsay. \"Madeline, my darling,\" said he, \"have you the courage to tell\nme openly what you think of Felix Graham?\"\n\n\"What I think of him, papa?\"\n\n\"Yes, my child. It may be that you are in some difficulty at this\nmoment, and that I can help you. It may be that your heart is sadder\nthan it would be if you knew all my thoughts and wishes respecting\nyou, and all your mother's. I have never had many secrets from my\nchildren, Madeline, and I should be pleased now if you could see into\nmy mind and know all my thoughts and wishes as they regard you.\"\n\n\"Dear papa!\"\n\n\"To see you happy--you and Augustus and Isabella--that is now\nour happiness; not to see you rich or great. High position and a\nplentiful income are great blessings in this world, so that they be\nachieved without a stain. But even in this world they are not the\ngreatest blessings. There are things much sweeter than them.\" As he\nsaid this, Madeline did not attempt to answer him, but she put her\narm once more within his, and clung to his side.\n\n\"Money and rank are only good, if every step by which they are gained\nbe good also. I should never blush to see my girl the wife of a poor\nman whom she loved; but I should be stricken to the core of my heart\nif I knew that she had become the wife of a rich man whom she did not\nlove.\"\n\n\"Papa!\" she said, clinging to him. She had meant to assure him that\nthat sorrow should never be his, but she could not get beyond the one\nword.\n\n\"If you love this man, let him come,\" said the judge, carried by his\nfeelings somewhat beyond the point to which he had intended to go.\n\"I know no harm of him. I know nothing but good of him. If you are\nsure of your own heart, let it be so. He shall be to me as another\nson,--to me and to your mother. Tell me, Madeline, shall it be so?\"\n\nShe was sure enough of her own heart; but how was she to be sure of\nthat other heart? \"It shall be so,\" said her father. But a man could\nnot be turned into a lover and a husband because she and her father\nagreed to desire it;--not even if her mother would join in that\nwish. She had confessed to her mother that she loved this man, and\nthe confession had been repeated to her father. But she had never\nexpressed even a hope that she was loved in return. \"But he has never\nspoken to me, papa,\" she said, whispering the words ever so softly\nlest the winds should carry them.\n\n\"No; I know he has never spoken to you,\" said the judge. \"He told me\nso himself. I like him the better for that.\"\n\nSo then there had been other communications made besides that which\nshe had made to her mother. Mr. Graham had spoken to her father, and\nhad spoken to him about her. In what way had he done this, and how\nhad he spoken? What had been his object, and when had it been done?\nHad she been indiscreet, and allowed him to read her secret? And then\na horrid thought came across her mind. Was he to come there and offer\nher his hand because he pitied and was sorry for her? The Friday\nfastings and the evening church and the sick visits would be better\nfar than that. She could not however muster courage to ask her father\nany question as to that interview between him and Mr. Graham.\n\n\"Well, my love,\" he said, \"I know it is impertinent to ask a young\nlady to speak on such a subject; but fathers are impertinent. Be\nfrank with me. I have told you what I think, and your mamma agrees\nwith me. Young Mr. Orme would have been her favourite--\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, that is impossible.\"\n\n\"So I perceive, my dear, and therefore we will say no more about it.\nI only mention his name because I want you to understand that you may\nspeak to your mamma quite openly on the subject. He is a fine young\nfellow, is Peregrine Orme.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he is, papa.\"\n\n\"But that is no reason you should marry him if you don't like him.\"\n\n\"I could never like him,--in that way.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear. There is an end of that, and I'm sorry for him.\nI think that if I had been a young man at The Cleeve, I should have\ndone just the same. And now let us decide this important question.\nWhen Master Graham's ribs, arms, and collar bones are a little\nstronger, shall we ask him to come back to Noningsby?\"\n\n\"If you please, papa.\"\n\n\"Very well, we'll have him here for the assize week. Poor fellow,\nhe'll have a hard job of work on hand just then, and won't have much\ntime for philandering. With Chaffanbrass to watch him on his own\nside, and Leatherham on the other, I don't envy him his position. I\nalmost think I should keep my arm in the sling till the assizes were\nover, by way of exciting a little pity.\"\n\n\"Is Mr. Graham going to defend Lady Mason?\"\n\n\"To help to do so, my dear.\"\n\n\"But, papa, she is innocent; don't you feel sure of that?\"\n\nThe judge was not quite so sure as he had been once. However, he said\nnothing of his doubts to Madeline. \"Mr. Graham's task on that account\nwill only be the more trying if it becomes difficult to establish her\ninnocence.\"\n\n\"Poor lady!\" said Madeline. \"You won't be the judge; will you, papa?\"\n\n\"No, certainly not. I would have preferred to have gone any other\ncircuit than to have presided in a case affecting so near a\nneighbour, and I may almost say a friend. Baron Maltby will sit in\nthat court.\"\n\n\"And will Mr. Graham have to do much, papa?\"\n\n\"It will be an occasion of very great anxiety to him, no doubt.\" And\nthen they began to return home,--Madeline forming a little plan in\nher mind by which Mr. Furnival and Mr. Chaffanbrass were to fail\nabsolutely in making out that lady's innocence, but the fact was to\nbe established to the satisfaction of the whole court, and of all the\nworld, by the judicious energy of Felix Graham.\n\nOn their homeward journey the judge again spoke of pictures and\nbooks, of failures and successes, and Madeline listened to him\ngratefully. But she did not again take much part in the conversation.\nShe could not now express a very fluent opinion on any subject, and\nto tell the truth, could have been well satisfied to have been left\nentirely to her own thoughts. But just before they came out again\nupon the road, her father stopped her and asked a direct question.\n\"Tell me, Madeline, are you happy now?\"\n\n[Illustration: \"Tell me, Madeline, are you happy now?\"]\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"That is right. And what you are to understand is this; Mr. Graham\nwill now be privileged by your mother and me to address you. He has\nalready asked my permission to do so, and I told him that I must\nconsider the matter before I either gave it or withheld it. I shall\nnow give him that permission.\" Whereupon Madeline made her answer by\na slight pressure upon his arm.\n\n\"But you may be sure of this, my dear; I shall be very discreet, and\ncommit you to nothing. If he should choose to ask you any question,\nyou will be at liberty to give him any answer that you may think\nfit.\" But Madeline at once confessed to herself that no such liberty\nremained to her. If Mr. Graham should choose to ask her a certain\nquestion, it would be in her power to give him only one answer. Had\nhe been kept away, had her father told her that such a marriage might\nnot be, she would not have broken her heart. She had already told\nherself, that under such circumstances, she could live and still live\ncontented. But now,--now if the siege were made, the town would have\nto capitulate at the first shot. Was it not an understood thing that\nthe governor had been recommended by the king to give up the keys as\nsoon as they were asked for?\n\n\"You will tell your mamma of this my dear,\" said the judge, as they\nwere entering their own gate.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Madeline. But she felt that, in this matter, her father\nwas more surely her friend than her mother. And indeed she could\nunderstand her mother's opposition to poor Felix, much better than\nher father's acquiescence.\n\n\"Do, my dear. What is anything to us in this world, if we are not all\nhappy together? She thinks that you have become sad, and she must\nknow that you are so no longer.\"\n\n\"But I have not been sad, papa,\" said Madeline, thinking with some\npride of her past heroism.\n\nWhen they reached the hall-door she had one more question to ask; but\nshe could not look in her father's face as she asked.\n\n\"Papa, is that review you were speaking of here at Noningsby?\"\n\n\"You will find it on my study table; but remember, Madeline, I don't\nabove half go along with him.\"\n\nThe judge went into his study before dinner, and found that the\nreview had been taken.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX.\n\nNO SURRENDER.\n\n\nSir Peregrine Orme had gone up to London, had had his interview with\nMr. Round, and had failed. He had then returned home, and hardly a\nword on the subject had been spoken between him and Mrs. Orme. Indeed\nlittle or nothing was now said between them as to Lady Mason or the\ntrial. What was the use of speaking on a subject that was in every\nway the cause of so much misery? He had made up his mind that it was\nno longer possible for him to take any active step in the matter. He\nhad become bail for her appearance in court, and that was the last\ntrifling act of friendship which he could show her. How was it any\nlonger possible that he could befriend her? He could not speak up\non her behalf with eager voice, and strong indignation against her\nenemies, as had formerly been his practice. He could give her no\ncounsel. His counsel would have taught her to abandon the property\nin the first instance, let the result be what it might. He had made\nhis little effort in that direction by seeing the attorney, and his\nlittle effort had been useless. It was quite clear to him that there\nwas nothing further for him to do;--nothing further for him, who\nbut a week or two since was so actively putting himself forward and\nletting the world know that he was Lady Mason's champion.\n\nWould he have to go into court as a witness? His mind was troubled\nmuch in his endeavour to answer that question. He had been her\ngreat friend. For years he had been her nearest neighbour. His\ndaughter-in-law still clung to her. She had lived at his house. She\nhad been chosen to be his wife. Who could speak to her character, if\nhe could not do so? And yet, what could he say, if so called on? Mr.\nFurnival, Mr. Chaffanbrass--all those who would have the selection\nof the witnesses, believing themselves in their client's innocence,\nas no doubt they did, would of course imagine that he believed in it\nalso. Could he tell them that it would not be in his power to utter a\nsingle word in her favour?\n\nIn these days Mrs. Orme went daily to the Farm. Indeed, she never\nmissed a day from that on which Lady Mason left The Cleeve up to the\ntime of the trial. It seemed to Sir Peregrine that his daughter's\naffection for this woman had grown with the knowledge of her guilt;\nbut, as I have said before, no discussion on the matter now took\nplace between them. Mrs. Orme would generally take some opportunity\nof saying that she had been at Orley Farm; but that was all.\n\nSir Peregrine during this time never left the house once, except for\nmorning service on Sundays. He hung his hat up on its accustomed peg\nwhen he returned from that ill-omened visit to Mr. Round, and did not\nmove it for days, ay, for weeks,--except on Sunday mornings. At first\nhis groom would come to him, suggesting to him that he should ride,\nand the woodman would speak to him about the young coppices; but\nafter a few days they gave up their efforts. His grandson also strove\nto take him out, speaking to him more earnestly than the servants\nwould do, but it was of no avail. Peregrine, indeed, gave up the\nattempt sooner, for to him his grandfather did in some sort confess\nhis own weakness. \"I have had a blow,\" said he; \"Peregrine, I have\nhad a blow. I am too old to bear up against it;--too old and too\nweak.\" Peregrine knew that he alluded in some way to that proposed\nmarriage, but he was quite in the dark as to the manner in which his\ngrandfather had been affected by it.\n\n\"People think nothing of that now, sir,\" said he, groping in the dark\nas he strove to administer consolation.\n\n\"People will think of it;--and I think of it. But never mind, my boy.\nI have lived my life, and am contented with it. I have lived my life,\nand have great joy that such as you are left behind to take my place.\nIf I had really injured you I should have broken my heart--have\nbroken my heart.\"\n\nPeregrine of course assured him that let what would come to him the\npride which he had in his grandfather would always support him. \"I\ndon't know anybody else that I could be so proud of,\" said Peregrine;\n\"for nobody else that I see thinks so much about other people. And I\nalways was, even when I didn't seem to think much about it;--always.\"\n\nPoor Peregrine! Circumstances had somewhat altered him since that\nday, now not more than six months ago, in which he had pledged\nhimself to abandon the delights of Cowcross Street. As long as there\nwas a hope for him with Madeline Staveley all this might be very\nwell. He preferred Madeline to Cowcross Street with all its delights.\nBut when there should be no longer any hope--and indeed, as things\nwent now, there was but little ground for hoping--what then? Might it\nnot be that his trial had come on him too early in life, and that he\nwould solace himself in his disappointment, if not with Carroty Bob,\nwith companionships and pursuits which would be as objectionable, and\nperhaps more expensive?\n\nOn three or four occasions his grandfather asked him how things\nwere going at Noningsby, striving to interest himself in something\nas to which the outlook was not altogether dismal, and by degrees\nlearned,--not exactly all the truth--but as much of the truth as\nPeregrine knew.\n\n\"Do as she tells you,\" said the grandfather, referring to Lady\nStaveley's last words.\n\n\"I suppose I must,\" said Peregrine, sadly. \"There's nothing else for\nit. But if there's anything that I hate in this world, it's waiting.\"\n\n\"You are both very young,\" said his grandfather.\n\n\"Yes; we are what people call young, I suppose. But I don't\nunderstand all that. Why isn't a fellow to be happy when he's young\nas well as when he's old?\"\n\nSir Peregrine did not answer him, but no doubt thought that he might\nalter his opinion in a few years. There is great doubt as to what may\nbe the most enviable time of life with a man. I am inclined to think\nthat it is at that period when his children have all been born but\nhave not yet began to go astray or to vex him with disappointment;\nwhen his own pecuniary prospects are settled, and he knows pretty\nwell what his tether will allow him; when the appetite is still good\nand the digestive organs at their full power; when he has ceased to\ncare as to the length of his girdle, and before the doctor warns\nhim against solid breakfasts and port wine after dinner; when his\naffectations are over and his infirmities have not yet come upon him;\nwhile he can still walk his ten miles, and feel some little pride in\nbeing able to do so; while he has still nerve to ride his horse to\nhounds, and can look with some scorn on the ignorance of younger men\nwho have hardly yet learned that noble art. As regards men, this,\nI think, is the happiest time of life; but who shall answer the\nquestion as regards women? In this respect their lot is more liable\nto disappointment. With the choicest flowers that blow the sweetest\naroma of their perfection lasts but for a moment. The hour that sees\nthem at their fullest glory sees also the beginning of their fall.\n\nOn one morning before the trial Sir Peregrine rang his bell and\nrequested that Mr. Peregrine might be asked to come to him. Mr.\nPeregrine was out at the moment, and did not make his appearance much\nbefore dark, but the baronet had fully resolved upon having this\ninterview, and ordered that the dinner should be put back for half\nan hour. \"Tell Mrs. Orme, with my compliments,\" he said, \"that if it\ndoes not put her to inconvenience we will not dine till seven.\" It\nput Mrs. Orme to no inconvenience; but I am inclined to agree with\nthe cook, who remarked that the compliments ought to have been sent\nto her.\n\n\"Sit down, Peregrine,\" he said, when his grandson entered his room\nwith his thick boots and muddy gaiters. \"I have been thinking of\nsomething.\"\n\n\"I and Samson have been cutting down trees all day,\" said Peregrine.\n\"You've no conception how the water lies down in the bottom there;\nand there's a fall every yard down to the river. It's a sin not to\ndrain it.\"\n\n\"Any sins of that kind, my boy, shall lie on your own head for the\nfuture. I will wash my hands of them.\"\n\n\"Then I'll go to work at once,\" said Peregrine, not quite\nunderstanding his grandfather.\n\n\"You must go to work on more than that, Peregrine.\" And then the old\nman paused. \"You must not think that I am doing this because I am\nunhappy for the hour, or that I shall repent it when the moment has\ngone by.\"\n\n\"Doing what?\" asked Peregrine.\n\n\"I have thought much of it, and I know that I am right. I cannot get\nout as I used to do, and do not care to meet people about business.\"\n\n\"I never knew you more clear-headed in my life, sir.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps not. We'll say nothing about that. What I intend to do\nis this;--to give up the property into your hands at Lady-day. You\nshall be master of The Cleeve from that time forth.\"\n\n\"Sir?\"\n\n\"The truth is, you desire employment, and I don't. The property is\nsmall, and therefore wants the more looking after. I have never had\na regular land steward, but have seen to that myself. If you'll take\nmy advice you'll do the same. There is no better employment for a\ngentleman. So now, my boy, you may go to work and drain wherever you\nlike. About that Crutchley bottom I have no doubt you're right. I\ndon't know why it has been neglected.\" These last words the baronet\nuttered in a weak, melancholy tone, asking, as it were, forgiveness\nfor his fault; whereas he had spoken out the purport of his great\nresolution with a clear, strong voice, as though the saying of the\nwords pleased him well.\n\n\"I could not hear of such a thing as that,\" said his grandson, after\na short pause.\n\n\"But you have heard it, Perry, and you may be quite sure that I\nshould not have named it had I not fully resolved upon it. I have\nbeen thinking of it for days, and have quite made up my mind. You\nwon't turn me out of the house, I know.\"\n\n\"All the same, I will not hear of it,\" said the young man, stoutly.\n\n\"Peregrine!\"\n\n\"I know very well what it all means, sir, and I am not at all\nastonished. You have wished to do something out of sheer goodness of\nheart, and you have been balked.\"\n\n\"We will not talk about that, Peregrine.\"\n\n\"But I must say a few words about it. All that has made you unhappy,\nand--and--and--\" He wanted to explain that his grandfather was\nashamed of his baffled attempt, and for that reason was cowed and\ndown at heart at the present moment; but that in the three or four\nmonths when this trial would be over and the wonder passed away, all\nthat would be forgotten, and he would be again as well as ever. But\nPeregrine, though he understood all this, was hardly able to express\nhimself.\n\n\"My boy,\" said the old man, \"I know very well what you mean. What\nyou say is partly true, and partly not quite true. Some day, perhaps,\nwhen we are sitting here together over the fire, I shall be better\nable to talk over all this; but not now, Perry. God has been very\ngood to me, and given me so much that I will not repine at this\nsorrow. I have lived my life, and am content.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, of course all that's true enough. And if God should choose\nthat you should--die, you know, or I either, some people would be\nsorry, but we shouldn't complain ourselves. But what I say is this:\nyou should never give up as long as you live. There's a sort of\nfeeling about it which I can't explain. One should always say to\noneself, No surrender.\" And Peregrine, as he spoke, stood up from his\nchair, thrust his hands into his trouser-pockets, and shook his head.\n\n[Illustration: \"No Surrender.\"]\n\nSir Peregrine smiled as he answered him. \"But Perry, my boy, we can't\nalways say that. When the heart and the spirit and the body have all\nsurrendered, why should the voice tell a foolish falsehood?\"\n\n\"But it shouldn't be a falsehood,\" said Peregrine. \"Nobody should\never knock under of his own accord.\"\n\n\"You are quite right there, my boy; you are quite right there. Stick\nto that yourself. But, remember, that you are not to knock under to\nany of your enemies. The worst that you will meet with are folly, and\nvice, and extravagance.\"\n\n\"That's of course,\" said Peregrine, by no means wishing on the\npresent occasion to bring under discussion his future contests with\nany such enemies as those now named by his grandfather.\n\n\"And now, suppose you dress for dinner,\" said the baronet. \"I've got\nahead of you there you see. What I've told you to-day I have already\ntold your mother.\"\n\n\"I'm sure she doesn't think you right.\"\n\n\"If she thinks me wrong, she is too kind and well-behaved to\nsay so,--which is more than I can say for her son. Your mother,\nPerry, never told me that I was wrong yet, though she has had many\noccasions;--too many, too many. But, come, go and dress for dinner.\"\n\n\"You are wrong in this, sir, if ever you were wrong in your life,\"\nsaid Peregrine, leaving the room. His grandfather did not answer him\nagain, but followed him out of the door, and walked briskly across\nthe hall into the drawing-room.\n\n\"There's Peregrine been lecturing me about draining,\" he said to his\ndaughter-in-law, striving to speak in a half-bantering tone of voice,\nas though things were going well with him.\n\n\"Lecturing you!\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"And he's right, too. There's nothing like it. He'll make a better\nfarmer, I take it, than Lucius Mason. You'll live to see him know the\nvalue of an acre of land as well as any man in the county. It's the\nvery thing that he's fit for. He'll do better with the property than\never I did.\"\n\nThere was something beautiful in the effort which the old man was\nmaking when watched by the eyes of one who knew him as well as did\nhis daughter-in-law. She knew him, and understood all the workings of\nhis mind, and the deep sorrow of his heart. In very truth, the star\nof his life was going out darkly under a cloud; but he was battling\nagainst his sorrow and shame--not that he might be rid of them\nhimself, but that others might not have to share them. That doctrine\nof \"No surrender\" was strong within his bosom, and he understood\nthe motto in a finer sense than that in which his grandson had used\nit. He would not tell them that his heart was broken,--not if he\ncould help it. He would not display his wound if it might be in his\npower to hide it. He would not confess that lands, and houses, and\nseignorial functions were no longer of value in his eyes. As far as\nmight be possible he would bear his own load till that and the memory\nof his last folly might be hidden together in the grave.\n\nBut he knew that he was no longer fit for a man's work, and that\nit would be well that he should abandon it. He had made a terrible\nmistake. In his old age he had gambled for a large stake, and had\nlost it all. He had ventured to love;--to increase the small number\nof those who were nearest and dearest to him, to add one to those\nwhom he regarded as best and purest,--and he had been terribly\ndeceived. He had for many years almost worshipped the one lady who\nhad sat at his table, and now in his old age he had asked her to\nshare her place of honour with another. What that other was need not\nnow be told. And the world knew that this woman was to have been his\nwife! He had boasted loudly that he would give her that place and\nthose rights. He had ventured his all upon her innocence and her\npurity. He had ventured his all,--and he had lost.\n\nI do not say that on this account there was any need that he should\nbe stricken to the ground,--that it behoved him as a man of high\nfeeling to be broken-hearted. He would have been a greater man had\nhe possessed the power to bear up against all this, and to go forth\nto the world bearing his burden bravely on his shoulders. But Sir\nPeregrine Orme was not a great man, and possessed few or none of the\nelements of greatness. He was a man of a singularly pure mind, and\nendowed with a strong feeling of chivalry. It had been everything to\nhim to be spoken of by the world as a man free from reproach,--who\nhad lived with clean hands and with clean people around him. All\nmanner of delinquencies he could forgive in his dependents which did\nnot tell of absolute baseness; but it would have half killed him had\nhe ever learned that those he loved had become false or fraudulent.\nWhen his grandson had come to trouble about the rats, he had acted,\nnot over-cleverly, a certain amount of paternal anger; but had\nPeregrine broken his promise to him, no acting would have been\nnecessary. It may therefore be imagined what were now his feelings as\nto Lady Mason.\n\nHer he could forgive for deceiving him. He had told his\ndaughter-in-law that he would forgive her; and it was a thing done.\nBut he could not forgive himself in that he had been deceived. He\ncould not forgive himself for having mingled with the sweet current\nof his Edith's life the foul waters of that criminal tragedy. He\ncould not now bid her desert Lady Mason: for was it not true that the\nwoman's wickedness was known to them two, through her resolve not to\ninjure those who had befriended her? But all this made the matter\nworse rather than better to him. It is all very well to say, \"No\nsurrender;\" but when the load placed upon the back is too heavy to be\nborne, the back must break or bend beneath it.\n\nHis load was too heavy to be borne, and therefore he said to himself\nthat he would put it down. He would not again see Lord Alston and\nthe old friends of former days. He would attend no more at the\nmagistrates' bench, but would send his grandson out into his place.\nFor the few days that remained to him in this world, he might be well\ncontented to abandon the turmoils and troubles of life. \"It will not\nbe for long,\" he said to himself over and over again. And then he\nwould sit in his arm-chair for hours, intending to turn his mind\nto such solemn thoughts as might befit a dying man. But, as he sat\nthere, he would still think of Lady Mason. He would remember her as\nshe had leaned against his breast on that day that he kissed her; and\nthen he would remember her as she was when she spoke those horrid\nwords to him--\"Yes; I did it; at night, when I was alone.\" And this\nwas the woman whom he had loved! This was the woman whom he still\nloved,--if all the truth might be confessed.\n\nHis grandson, though he read much of his grandfather's mind, had\nfailed to read it all. He did not know how often Sir Peregrine\nrepeated to himself those words, \"No Surrender,\" or how gallantly\nhe strove to live up to them. Lands and money and seats of honour\nhe would surrender, as a man surrenders his tools when he has done\nhis work; but his tone of feeling and his principle he would not\nsurrender, though the maintenance of them should crush him with their\nweight. The woman had been very vile, desperately false, wicked\nbeyond belief, with premeditated villany, for years and years;--and\nthis was the woman whom he had wished to make the bosom companion of\nhis latter days!\n\n\"Samson is happy now, I suppose, that he has got the axe in his\nhand,\" he said to his grandson.\n\n\"Pretty well for that, sir, I think.\"\n\n\"That man will cut down every tree about the place, if you'll let\nhim.\" And in that way he strove to talk about the affairs of the\nproperty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX.\n\nWHAT REBEKAH DID FOR HER SON.\n\n\nEvery day Mrs. Orme went up to Orley Farm and sat for two hours\nwith Lady Mason. We may say that there was now no longer any secret\nbetween them, and that she whose life had been so innocent, so pure,\nand so good, could look into the inmost heart and soul of that other\nwoman whose career had been supported by the proceeds of one terrible\nlife-long iniquity. And now, by degrees, Lady Mason would begin to\nplead for herself, or rather, to put in a plea for the deed she had\ndone, acknowledging, however, that she, the doer of it, had fallen\nalmost below forgiveness through the crime. \"Was he not his son as\nmuch as that other one; and had I not deserved of him that he should\ndo this thing for me?\" And again \"Never once did I ask of him any\nfavour for myself from the day that I gave myself to him, because he\nhad been good to my father and mother. Up to the very hour of his\ndeath I never asked him to spend a shilling on my own account. But I\nasked him to do this thing for his child; and when at last he refused\nme, I told him that I myself would cause it to be done.\"\n\n\"You told him so?\"\n\n\"I did; and I think that he believed me. He knew that I was one who\nwould act up to my word. I told him that Orley Farm should belong to\nour babe.\"\n\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\n\"He bade me beware of my soul. My answer was very terrible, and I\nwill not shock you with it. Ah me! it is easy to talk of repentance,\nbut repentance will not come with a word.\"\n\nIn these days Mrs. Orme became gradually aware that hitherto she had\ncomprehended but little of Lady Mason's character. There was a power\nof endurance about her, and a courage that was almost awful to the\nmind of the weaker, softer, and better woman. Lady Mason, during\nher sojourn at The Cleeve, had seemed almost to sink under her\nmisfortune; nor had there been any hypocrisy, any pretence in her\napparent misery. She had been very wretched;--as wretched a human\ncreature, we may say, as any crawling God's earth at that time. But\nshe had borne her load, and, bearing it, had gone about her work,\nstill striving with desperate courage as the ground on which she trod\ncontinued to give way beneath her feet, inch by inch. They had known\nand pitied her misery; they had loved her for misery--as it is in\nthe nature of such people to do;--but they had little known how great\nhad been the cause for it. They had sympathised with the female\nweakness which had succumbed when there was hardly any necessity for\nsuccumbing. Had they then known all, they would have wondered at the\nstrength which made a struggle possible under such circumstances.\n\nEven now she would not yield. I have said that there had been no\nhypocrisy in her misery during those weeks last past; and I have said\nso truly. But there had perhaps been some pretences, some acting of a\npart, some almost necessary pretence as to her weakness. Was she not\nbound to account to those around her for her great sorrow? And was it\nnot above all things needful that she should enlist their sympathy\nand obtain their aid? She had been obliged to cry to them for help,\nthough obliged also to confess that there was little reason for such\ncrying. \"I am a woman, and weak,\" she had said, \"and therefore cannot\nwalk alone, now that the way is stony.\" But what had been the truth\nwith her? How would she have cried, had it been possible for her to\nutter the sharp cry of her heart? The waters had been closing over\nher head, and she had clutched at a hand to save her; but the owner\nof that hand might not know how imminent, how close was the danger.\n\nBut in these days, as she sat in her own room with Mrs. Orme, the\nowner of that hand might know everything. The secret had been told,\nand there was no longer need for pretence. As she could now expose\nto view the whole load of her wretchedness, so also could she make\nknown the strength that was still left for endurance. And these two\nwomen who had become endeared to each other under such terrible\ncircumstances, came together at these meetings with more of the\nequality of friendship than had ever existed at The Cleeve. It may\nseem strange that it should be so--strange that the acknowledged\nforger of her husband's will should be able to maintain a better\nclaim for equal friendship than the lady who was believed to be\ninnocent and true! But it was so. Now she stood on true ground;--now,\nas she sat there with Mrs. Orme, she could speak from her heart,\npouring forth the real workings of her mind. From Mrs. Orme she had\nno longer aught to fear; nor from Sir Peregrine. Everything was known\nto them, and she could now tell of every incident of her crime with\nan outspoken boldness that in itself was incompatible with the humble\nbearing of an inferior in the presence of one above her.\n\nAnd she did still hope. The one point to be gained was this; that\nher son, her only son, the child on whose behalf this crime had been\ncommitted, should never know her shame, or live to be disgraced by\nher guilt. If she could be punished, she would say, and he left in\nignorance of her punishment, she would not care what indignities\nthey might heap upon her. She had heard of penal servitude, of years,\nterribly long, passed in all the misery of vile companionship; of\nsolitary confinement, and the dull madness which it engenders; of\nall the terrors of a life spent under circumstances bearable only by\nthe uneducated, the rude, and the vile. But all this was as nothing\nto her compared with the loss of honour to her son. \"I should live,\"\nshe would say; \"but he would die. You cannot ask me to become his\nmurderer!\"\n\nIt was on this point that they differed always. Mrs. Orme would\nhave had her confess everything to Lucius, and strove to make her\nunderstand that if he were so told, the blow would fall less heavily\nthan it would do if the knowledge came to him from her conviction at\nthe trial. But the mother would not bring herself to believe that it\nwas absolutely necessary that he should ever know it. \"There was the\nproperty! Yes; but let the trial come, and if she were acquitted,\nthen let some arrangement be made about that. The lawyers might find\nout some cause why it should be surrendered.\" But Mrs. Orme feared\nthat if the trial were over, and the criminal saved from justice,\nthe property would not be surrendered. And then how would that wish\nof repentance be possible? After all was not that the one thing\nnecessary?\n\nI will not say that Mrs. Orme in these days ever regretted that her\nsympathy and friendship had been thus bestowed, but she frequently\nacknowledged to herself that the position was too difficult for her.\nThere was no one whose assistance she could ask; for she felt that\nshe could not in this matter ask counsel from Sir Peregrine. She\nherself was good, and pure, and straightminded, and simple in her\nperception of right and wrong; but Lady Mason was greater than she in\nforce of character,--a stronger woman in every way, endowed with more\nforce of will, with more power of mind, with greater energy, and\na swifter flow of words. Sometimes she almost thought it would be\nbetter that she should stay away from Orley Farm; but then she\nhad promised to be true to her wretched friend, and the mother's\nsolicitude for her son still softened the mother's heart.\n\nIn these days, till the evening came, Lucius Mason never made his way\ninto his mother's sitting-room, which indeed was the drawing-room of\nthe house,--and he and Mrs. Orme, as a rule, hardly ever met each\nother. If he saw her as she entered or left the place, he would lift\nhis hat to her and pass by without speaking. He was not admitted to\nthose councils of his mother's, and would not submit to ask after\nhis mother's welfare or to inquire as to her affairs from a stranger.\nOn no other subject was it possible that he should now speak to the\ndaily visitor and the only visitor at Orley Farm. All this Mrs. Orme\nunderstood, and saw that the young man was alone and comfortless. He\npassed his hours below, in his own room, and twice a day his mother\nfound him in the parlour, and then they sat through their silent,\nmiserable meals. She would then leave him, always saying some soft\nwords of motherly love, and putting her hand either upon his shoulder\nor his arm. On such occasions he was never rough to her, but he would\nnever respond to her caress. She had ill-treated him, preferring in\nher trouble the assistance of a stranger to his assistance. She would\nask him neither for his money nor his counsel, and as she had thus\nchosen to stand aloof from him, he also would stand aloof from her.\nNot for always,--as he said to himself over and over again; for his\nheart misgave him when he saw the lines of care so plainly written\non his mother's brow. Not for always should it be so. The day of the\ntrial would soon be present, and the day of the trial would soon be\nover; then again would they be friends. Poor young man! Unfortunate\nyoung man!\n\nMrs. Orme saw all this, and to her it was very terrible. What would\nbe the world to her, if her boy should frown at her, and look black\nwhen she caressed him? And she thought that it was the fault of\nthe mother rather than of the son; as indeed was not all that\nwretchedness the mother's fault? But then again, there was the one\ngreat difficulty. How could any step be taken in the right direction\ntill the whole truth had been confessed to him?\n\nThe two women were sitting together in that up stairs room; and the\nday of the trial was now not a full week distant from them, when Mrs.\nOrme again tried to persuade the mother to intrust her son with the\nburden of all her misery. On the preceding day Mr. Solomon Aram had\nbeen down at Orley Farm, and had been with Lady Mason for an hour.\n\n\"He knows the truth!\" Lady Mason had said to her friend. \"I am sure\nof that.\"\n\n\"But did he ask you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, he did not ask me that. He asked of little things that\nhappened at the time; but from his manner I am sure he knows it all.\nHe says--that I shall escape.\"\n\n\"Did he say escape?\"\n\n\"No; not that word, but it was the same thing. He spoke to Lucius,\nfor I saw them on the lawn together.\"\n\n\"You do not know what he said to him?\"\n\n\"No; for Lucius would not speak to me, and I could not ask him.\" And\nthen they both were silent, for Mrs. Orme was thinking how she could\nbring about that matter that was so near her heart. Lady Mason was\nseated in a large old-fashioned arm-chair, in which she now passed\nnearly all her time. The table was by her side, but she rarely turned\nherself to it. She sat leaning with her elbow on her arm, supporting\nher face with her hand; and opposite to her, so close that she might\nlook into her face and watch every movement of her eyes, sat Mrs.\nOrme,--intent upon that one thing, that the woman before her should\nbe brought to repent the evil she had done.\n\n\"And you have not spoken to Lucius?\"\n\n\"No,\" she answered. \"No more than I have told you. What could I say\nto him about the man?\"\n\n\"Not about Mr. Aram. It might not be necessary to speak of him. He\nhas his work to do; and I suppose that he must do it in his own way?\"\n\n\"Yes; he must do it, in his own way. Lucius would not understand.\"\n\n\"Unless you told him everything, of course he could not understand.\"\n\n\"That is impossible.\"\n\n\"No, Lady Mason, it is not impossible. Dear Lady Mason, do not turn\nfrom me in that way. It is for your sake,--because I love you, that I\npress you to do this. If he knew it all--\"\n\n\"Could you tell your son such a tale?\" said Lady Mason, turning upon\nher sharply, and speaking almost with an air of anger.\n\nMrs. Orme was for a moment silenced, for she could not at once bring\nherself to conceive it possible that she could be so circumstanced.\nBut at last she answered. \"Yes,\" she said, \"I think I could, if--.\"\nAnd then she paused.\n\n\"If you had done such a deed! Ah, you do not know, for the doing of\nit would be impossible to you. You can never understand what was my\nchildhood, and how my young years were passed. I never loved anything\nbut him;--that is, till I knew you, and--and--.\" But instead of\nfinishing her sentence she pointed down towards The Cleeve. \"How,\nthen, can I tell him? Mrs. Orme, I would let them pull me to pieces,\nbit by bit, if in that way I could save him.\"\n\n\"Not in that way,\" said Mrs. Orme; \"not in that way.\"\n\nBut Lady Mason went on pouring forth the pent-up feelings of her\nbosom, not regarding the faint words of her companion. \"Till he lay\nin my arms I had loved nothing. From my earliest years I had been\ntaught to love money, wealth, and property; but as to myself the\nteachings had never come home to me. When they bade me marry the old\nman because he was rich, I obeyed them,--not caring for his riches,\nbut knowing that it behoved me to relieve them of the burden of my\nsupport. He was kinder to me than they had been, and I did for him\nthe best I could. But his money and his wealth were little to me. He\ntold me over and over again that when he died I should have the means\nto live, and that was enough. I would not pretend to him that I cared\nfor the grandeur of his children who despised me. But then came my\nbaby, and the world was all altered for me. What could I do for the\nonly thing that I had ever called my own? Money and riches they had\ntold me were everything.\"\n\n\"But they had told you wrong,\" said Mrs. Orme, as she wiped the tears\nfrom her eyes.\n\n\"They had told me falsely. I had heard nothing but falsehoods from my\nyouth upwards,\" she answered fiercely. \"For myself I had not cared\nfor these things; but why should not he have money and riches and\nland? His father had them to give over and above what had already\nmade those sons and daughters so rich and proud. Why should not this\nother child also be his father's heir? Was he not as well born as\nthey? was he not as fair a child? What did Rebekah do, Mrs. Orme? Did\nshe not do worse; and did it not all go well with her? Why should my\nboy be an Ishmael? Why should I be treated as the bondwoman, and see\nmy little one perish of thirst in this world's wilderness?\"\n\n\"No Saviour had lived and died for the world in those days,\" said\nMrs. Orme.\n\n\"And no Saviour had lived and died for me,\" said the wretched woman,\nalmost shrieking in her despair. The lines of her face were terrible\nto be seen as she thus spoke, and an agony of anguish loaded her brow\nupon which Mrs. Orme was frightened to look. She fell on her knees\nbefore the wretched woman, and taking her by both her hands strove\nall she could to find some comfort for her.\n\n\"Ah, do not say so. Do not say that. Whatever may come, that\nmisery--that worst of miseries need not oppress you. If that indeed\nwere true!\"\n\n\"It was true;--and how should it be otherwise?\"\n\n\"But now,--now. It need not be true now. Lady Mason, for your soul's\nsake say that it is so now.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Orme,\" she said, speaking with a singular quiescence of tone\nafter the violence of her last words, \"it seems to me that I care\nmore for his soul than for my own. For myself I can bear even that.\nBut if he were a castaway--!\"\n\nI will not attempt to report the words that passed between them for\nthe next half-hour, for they concerned a matter which I may not dare\nto handle too closely in such pages as these. But Mrs. Orme still\nknelt there at her feet, pressing Lady Mason's hands, pressing\nagainst her knees, as with all the eagerness of true affection she\nendeavoured to bring her to a frame of mind that would admit of some\ncomfort. But it all ended in this:--Let everything be told to Lucius,\nso that the first step back to honesty might be taken,--and then let\nthem trust to Him whose mercy can ever temper the wind to the shorn\nlamb.\n\nBut, as Lady Mason had once said to herself, repentance will not come\nwith a word. \"I cannot tell him,\" she said at last. \"It is a thing\nimpossible. I should die at his feet before the words were spoken.\"\n\n\"I will do it for you,\" said Mrs. Orme, offering from pure charity\nto take upon herself a task perhaps as heavy as any that a human\ncreature could perform. \"I will tell him.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" screamed Lady Mason, taking Mrs. Orme by both her arms as\nshe spoke. \"You will not do so: say that you will not. Remember your\npromise to me. Remember why it is that you know it all yourself.\"\n\n\"I will not, surely, unless you bid me,\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"No, no; I do not bid you. Mind, I do not bid you. I will not have it\ndone. Better anything than that, while it may yet be avoided. I have\nyour promise; have I not?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course I should not do it unless you told me.\" And then,\nafter some further short stay, during which but little was said, Mrs.\nOrme got up to go.\n\n\"You will come to me to-morrow,\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"Yes, certainly,\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Because I feared that I had offended you.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; I will take no offence from you.\"\n\n\"You should not, for you know what I have to bear. You know, and no\none else knows. Sir Peregrine does not know. He cannot understand.\nBut you know and understand it all. And, Mrs. Orme, what you do now\nwill be counted to you for great treasure,--for very great treasure.\nYou are better than the Samaritan, for he went on his way. But you\nwill stay till the last. Yes; I know you will stay.\" And the poor\ncreature kissed her only friend;--kissed her hands and her forehead\nand her breast. Then Mrs. Orme went without speaking, for her heart\nwas full, and the words would not come to her; but as she went she\nsaid to herself that she would stay till the last.\n\nStanding alone on the steps before the front door she found Lucius\nMason all alone, and some feeling moved her to speak a word to him as\nshe passed. \"I hope all this does not trouble you much, Mr. Mason,\"\nshe said, offering her hand to him. She felt that her words were\nhypocritical as she was speaking them; but under such circumstances\nwhat else could she say to him?\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Orme, such an episode in one's family history does give\none some trouble. I am unhappy,--very unhappy; but not too much\nso to thank you for your most unusual kindness to my poor mother.\"\nAnd then, having been so far encouraged by her speaking to him, he\naccompanied her round the house on to the lawn, from whence a path\nled away through a shrubbery on to the road which would take her by\nthe village of Coldharbour to The Cleeve.\n\n\"Mr. Mason,\" she said, as they walked for a few steps together before\nthe house, \"do not suppose that I presume to interfere between you\nand your mother.\"\n\n\"You have a right to interfere now,\" he said.\n\n\"But I think you might comfort her if you would be more with her.\nWould it not be better if you could talk freely together about all\nthis?\"\n\n\"It would be better,\" he said; \"but I fear that that is no longer\npossible. When this trial is over, and the world knows that she is\ninnocent; when people shall see how cruelly she has been used--\"\n\nMrs. Orme might not tell the truth to him, but she could with\ndifficulty bear to hear him dwell thus confidently on hopes which\nwere so false. \"The future is in the hands of God, Mr. Mason; but for\nthe present--\"\n\n\"The present and the future are both in His hands, Mrs. Orme. I know\nmy mother's innocence, and would have done a son's part towards\nestablishing it;--but she would not allow me. All this will soon be\nover now, and then, I trust, she and I will once again understand\neach other. Till then I doubt whether I shall be wise to interfere.\nGood morning, Mrs. Orme; and pray believe that I appreciate at its\nfull worth all that you are doing for her.\" Then he again lifted his\nhat and left her.\n\nLady Mason from her window saw them as they walked together, and her\nheart for a moment misgave her. Could it be that her friend was\ntreacherous to her? Was it possible that even now she was telling\neverything that she had sworn that she would not tell? Why were they\ntwo together, seeing that they passed each other day by day without\nintercourse? And so she watched with anxious eyes till they parted,\nand then she saw that Lucius stood idly on the terrace swinging his\nstick as he looked down the hill towards the orchard below him. He\nwould not have stood thus calmly had he already heard his mother's\nshame. This she knew, and having laid aside her immediate fears she\nretreated back to her chair. No; she would not tell him: at any rate\ntill the trial should be over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI.\n\nTHE STATE OF PUBLIC OPINION.\n\n\nThe day of the trial was now quickly coming on, and the London world,\nespecially the world of lawyers, was beginning to talk much on the\nsubject. Men about the Inns of Court speculated as to the verdict,\noffering to each other very confident opinions as to the result, and\noffering, on some occasions, bets as well as opinions. The younger\nworld of barristers was clearly of opinion that Lady Mason was\ninnocent; but a portion, an unhappy portion, was inclined to fear,\nthat, in spite of her innocence, she would be found guilty. The elder\nworld of barristers was not, perhaps, so demonstrative, but in that\nworld the belief in her innocence was not so strong, and the fear of\nher condemnation much stronger. The attorneys, as a rule, regarded\nher as guilty. To the policeman's mind every man not a policeman is\na guilty being, and the attorneys perhaps share something of this\nfeeling. But the attorneys to a man expected to see her acquitted.\nGreat was their faith in Mr. Furnival; great their faith in Solomon\nAram; but greater than in all was their faith in Mr. Chaffanbrass. If\nMr. Chaffanbrass could not pull her through, with a prescription of\ntwenty years on her side, things must be very much altered indeed in\nour English criminal court. To the outer world, that portion of the\nworld which had nothing to do with the administration of the law, the\nidea of Lady Mason having been guilty seemed preposterous. Of course\nshe was innocent, and of course she would be found to be innocent.\nAnd of course, also, that Joseph Mason of Groby Park was, and would\nbe found to be, the meanest, the lowest, the most rapacious of\nmankind.\n\nAnd then the story of Sir Peregrine's attachment and proposed\nmarriage, joined as it was to various hints of the manner in which\nthat marriage had been broken off, lent a romance to the whole\naffair, and added much to Lady Mason's popularity. Everybody had\nnow heard of it, and everybody was also aware, that though the\nidea of a marriage had been abandoned, there had been no quarrel.\nThe friendship between the families was as close as ever, and\nSir Peregrine,--so it was understood--had pledged himself to an\nacquittal. It was felt to be a public annoyance that an affair of so\nexciting a nature should be allowed to come off in the little town of\nAlston. The court-house, too, was very defective in its arrangements,\nand ill qualified to give accommodation to the great body of would-be\nattendants at the trial. One leading newspaper went so far as to\nsuggest, that in such a case as this, the antediluvian prejudices\nof the British grandmother--meaning the Constitution--should be set\naside, and the trial should take place in London. But I am not aware\nthat any step was taken towards the carrying out of so desirable a\nproject.\n\nDown at Hamworth the feeling in favour of Lady Mason was not\nperhaps so strong as it was elsewhere. Dockwrath was a man not much\nrespected, but nevertheless many believed in him; and down there, in\nthe streets of Hamworth, he was not slack in propagating his view of\nthe question. He had no doubt, he said, how the case would go. He had\nno doubt, although he was well aware that Mr. Mason's own lawyers\nwould do all they could to throw over their own client. But he was\ntoo strong, he said, even for that. The facts as he would bring them\nforward would confound Round and Crook, and compel any jury to find\na verdict of guilty. I do not say that all Hamworth believed in\nDockwrath, but his energy and confidence did have its effect, and\nLady Mason's case was not upheld so strongly in her own neighbourhood\nas elsewhere.\n\nThe witnesses in these days were of course very important persons,\nand could not but feel the weight of that attention which the world\nwould certainly pay to them. There would be four chief witnesses for\nthe prosecution; Dockwrath himself, who would be prepared to speak\nas to the papers left behind him by old Usbech; the man in whose\npossession now remained that deed respecting the partnership which\nwas in truth executed by old Sir Joseph on that fourteenth of\nJuly; Bridget Bolster; and John Kenneby. Of the manner in which Mr.\nDockwrath used his position we already know enough. The man who held\nthe deed, one Torrington, was a relative of Martock, Sir Joseph's\npartner, and had been one of his executors. It was not much indeed\nthat he had to say, but that little sent him up high in the social\nscale during those days. He lived at Kennington, and he was asked\nout to dinner in that neighbourhood every day for a week running, on\nthe score of his connection with the great Orley Farm case. Bridget\nBolster was still down at the hotel in the West of England, and\nbeing of a solid, sensible, and somewhat unimaginative turn of mind,\nprobably went through her duties to the last without much change of\nmanner. But the effect of the coming scenes upon poor John Kenneby\nwas terrible. It was to him as though for the time they had made of\nhim an Atlas, and compelled him to bear on his weak shoulders the\nweight of the whole world. Men did talk much about Lady Mason and the\ncoming trial; but to him it seemed as though men talked of nothing\nelse. At Hubbles and Grease's it was found useless to put figures\ninto his hands till all this should be over. Indeed it was doubted\nby many whether he would ever recover his ordinary tone of mind.\nIt seemed to be understood that he would be cross-examined by\nChaffanbrass, and there were those who thought that John Kenneby\nwould never again be equal to a day's work after that which he would\nthen be made to endure. That he would have been greatly relieved\ncould the whole thing have been wiped away from him there can\nbe no manner of doubt; but I fancy that he would also have been\ndisappointed. It is much to be great for a day, even though the day's\ngreatness should cause the shipwreck of a whole life.\n\n\"I shall endeavour to speak the truth,\" said John Kenneby, solemnly.\n\n\"The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,\" said\nMoulder.\n\n\"Yes, Moulder, that will be my endeavour; and then I may lay my hand\nupon my bosom and think that I have done my duty by my country.\" And\nas Kenneby spoke he suited the action to the word.\n\n\"Quite right, John,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Them's the sentiments of\na man, and I, as a woman having a right to speak where you are\nconcerned, quite approve of them.\"\n\n\"They'll get nothing but the truth out of John,\" said Mrs. Moulder;\n\"not if he knows it.\" These last words she added, actuated by\nadmiration of what she had heard of Mr. Chaffanbrass, and perhaps\nwith some little doubt as to her brother's firmness.\n\n\"That's where it is,\" said Moulder. \"Lord bless you, John, they'll\nturn you round their finger like a bit of red tape. Truth! Gammon!\nWhat do they care for truth?\"\n\n\"But I care, Moulder,\" said Kenneby. \"I don't suppose they can make\nme tell falsehoods if I don't wish it.\"\n\n\"Not if you're the man I take you to be,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"Gammon!\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Mr. Moulder, that's an objectionable word,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"If\nJohn Kenneby is the man I take him to be,--and who's a right to speak\nif I haven't, seeing that I am going to commit myself for this world\ninto his hands?\"--and Mrs. Smiley, as she spoke, simpered, and looked\ndown with averted head on the fulness of her Irish tabinet--\"if\nhe's the man that I take him to be, he won't say on this thrilling\noccasion no more than the truth, nor yet no less. Now that isn't\ngammon--if I know what gammon is.\"\n\nIt will have been already seen that the party in question were\nassembled at Mr. Moulder's room in Great St. Helen's. There had been\na little supper party there to commemorate the final arrangements\nas to the coming marriage, and the four were now sitting round the\nfire with their glasses of hot toddy at their elbows. Moulder was\narmed with his pipe, and was enjoying himself in that manner which\nmost delighted him. When last we saw him he had somewhat exceeded\ndiscretion in his cups, and was not comfortable. But at the present\nnothing ailed him. The supper had been good, the tobacco was good,\nand the toddy was good. Therefore when the lovely Thais sitting\nbeside him,--Thais however on this occasion having been provided not\nfor himself but for his brother-in-law,--when Thais objected to the\nuse of his favourite word, he merely chuckled down in the bottom of\nhis fat throat, and allowed her to finish her sentence.\n\nPoor John Kenneby had more--much more, on his hands than this\ndreadful trial. Since he had declared that the Adriatic was free\nto wed another, he had found himself devoted and given up to Mrs.\nSmiley. For some days after that auspicious evening there had been\nconsiderable wrangling between Mrs. Moulder and Mrs. Smiley as to the\nproceeds of the brick-field; and on this question Moulder himself\nhad taken a part. The Moulder interest had of course desired that\nall right of management in the brick-field should be vested in\nthe husband, seeing that, according to the usages of this country,\nbrick-fields and their belongings appertain rather to men than to\nwomen; but Mrs. Smiley had soon made it evident that she by no means\nintended to be merely a sleeping partner in the firm. At one time\nKenneby had entertained a hope of escape; for neither would the\nMoulder interest give way, nor would the Smiley. But two hundred a\nyear was a great stake, and at last the thing was arranged, very much\nin accordance with the original Smiley view. And now at this most\ntrying period of his life, poor Kenneby had upon his mind all the\ncares of a lover as well as the cares of a witness.\n\n\"I shall do my best,\" said John. \"I shall do my best and then throw\nmyself upon Providence.\"\n\n\"And take a little drop of something comfortable in your pocket,\"\nsaid his sister, \"so as to sperrit you up a little when your name's\ncalled.\"\n\n\"Sperrit him up!\" said Moulder; \"why I suppose he'll be standing in\nthat box the best part of a day. I knowed a man was a witness; it was\na case of horse-stealing; and the man who was the witness was the man\nwho'd took the horse.\"\n\n\"And he was witness against hisself!\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"No; he'd paid for it. That is to say, either he had or he hadn't.\nThat was what they wanted to get out of him, and I'm blessed if he\ndidn't take 'em till the judge wouldn't set there any longer. And\nthen they hadn't got it out of him.\"\n\n\"But John Kenneby ain't one of that sort,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"I suppose that man did not want to unbosom himself,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"Well; no. The likes of him seldom do like to unbosom themselves,\"\nsaid Moulder.\n\n\"But that will be my desire. If they will only allow me to speak\nfreely whatever I know about this matter, I will give them no\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"You mean to act honest, John,\" said his sister.\n\n\"I always did, Mary Anne.\"\n\n\"Well now, I'll tell you what it is,\" said Moulder. \"As Mrs. Smiley\ndon't like it I won't say anything more about gammon;--not just at\npresent, that is.\"\n\n\"I've no objection to gammon, Mr. Moulder, when properly used,\" said\nMrs. Smiley, \"but I look on it as disrespectful; and seeing the\nposition which I hold as regards John Kenneby, anything disrespectful\nto him is hurtful to my feelings.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Moulder. \"And now, John, I'll just tell you what\nit is. You've no more chance of being allowed to speak freely there\nthan--than--than--no more than if you was in church. What are them\nfellows paid for if you're to say whatever you pleases out in your\nown way?\"\n\n\"He only wants to say the truth, M.,\" said Mrs. Moulder, who probably\nknew less than her husband of the general usages of courts of law.\n\n\"Truth be ----,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Mr. Moulder!\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"There's ladies by, if you'll please\nto remember.\"\n\n\"To hear such nonsense sets one past oneself,\" continued he; \"as if\nall those lawyers were brought together there--the cleverest and\nsharpest fellows in the kingdom, mind you--to listen to a man like\nJohn here telling his own story in his own way. You'll have to tell\nyour story in their way; that is, in two different ways. There'll be\none fellow'll make you tell it his way first, and another fellow'll\nmake you tell it again his way afterwards; and its odds but what the\nfirst 'll be at you again after that, till you won't know whether you\nstand on your heels or your head.\"\n\n\"That can't be right,\" said Mrs. Moulder.\n\n\"And why can't it be right?\" said Moulder. \"They're paid for it;\nit's their duties; just as it's my duty to sell Hubbles and Grease's\nsugar. It's not for me to say the sugar's bad, or the samples not\nequal to the last. My duty is to sell, and I sell;--and it's their\nduty to get a verdict.\"\n\n\"But the truth, Moulder--!\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"Gammon!\" said Moulder. \"Begging your pardon, Mrs. Smiley, for making\nuse of the expression. Look you here, John; if you're paid to bring\na man off not guilty, won't you bring him off if you can? I've been\nat trials times upon times, and listened till I've wished from the\nbottom of my heart that I'd been brought up a barrister. Not that I\nthink much of myself, and I mean of course with education and all\nthat accordingly. It's beautiful to hear them. You'll see a little\nfellow in a wig, and he'll get up; and there'll be a man in the box\nbefore him,--some swell dressed up to his eyes, who thinks no end of\nstrong beer of himself; and in about ten minutes he'll be as flabby\nas wet paper, and he'll say--on his oath, mind you,--just anything\nthat that little fellow wants him to say. That's power, mind you, and\nI call it beautiful.\"\n\n\"But it ain't justice,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"Why not? I say it is justice. You can have it if you choose to pay\nfor it, and so can I. If I buy a greatcoat against the winter, and\nyou go out at night without having one, is it injustice because\nyou're perished by the cold while I'm as warm as a toast. I say it's\na grand thing to live in a country where one can buy a greatcoat.\"\n\nThe argument had got so far, Mr. Moulder certainly having the best of\nit, when a ring at the outer door was heard.\n\n\"Now who on earth is that?\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Snengkeld, I shouldn't wonder,\" said his wife.\n\n\"I hope it ain't no stranger,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Situated as John\nand I are now, strangers is so disagreeable.\" And then the door was\nopened by the maid-servant, and Mr. Kantwise was shown into the room.\n\n\"Halloo, Kantwise!\" said Mr. Moulder, not rising from his chair, or\ngiving any very decided tokens of welcome. \"I thought you were down\nsomewhere among the iron foundries?\"\n\n\"So I was, Mr. Moulder, but I came up yesterday. Mrs. Moulder, allow\nme to have the honour. I hope I see you quite well; but looking\nat you I need not ask. Mr. Kenneby, sir, your very humble servant.\nThe day's coming on fast; isn't it, Mr. Kenneby? Ma'am, your very\nobedient. I believe I haven't the pleasure of being acquainted.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Smiley, Mr. Kantwise. Mr. Kantwise, Mrs. Smiley,\" said the\nlady of the house, introducing her visitors to each other in the\nappropriate way.\n\n\"Quite delighted, I'm sure,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"Smiley as is, and Kenneby as will be this day three weeks,\" said\nMoulder; and then they all enjoyed that little joke, Mrs. Smiley by\nno means appearing bashful in the matter although Mr. Kantwise was a\nstranger.\n\n\"I thought I should find Mr. Kenneby here,\" said Kantwise, when the\nsubject of the coming nuptials had been sufficiently discussed, \"and\ntherefore I just stepped in. No intrusion, I hope, Mr. Moulder.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Moulder; \"make yourself at home. There's the stuff\non the table. You know what the tap is.\"\n\n\"I've just parted from--Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Kantwise, speaking\nin a tone of voice which implied the great importance of the\ncommunication, and looking round the table to see the effect of it\nupon the circle.\n\n\"Then you've parted from a very low-lived party, let me tell you\nthat,\" said Moulder. He had not forgotten Dockwrath's conduct in the\ncommercial room at Leeds, and was fully resolved that he never would\nforgive it.\n\n\"That's as may be,\" said Kantwise. \"I say nothing on that subject at\nthe present moment, either one way or the other. But I think you'll\nall agree as to this: that at the present moment Mr. Dockwrath fills\na conspicuous place in the public eye.\"\n\n\"By no means so conspicuous as John Kenneby,\" said Mrs. Smiley, \"if I\nmay be allowed in my position to hold an opinion.\"\n\n\"That's as may be, ma'am. I say nothing about that. What I hold by\nis, that Mr. Dockwrath does hold a conspicuous place in the public\neye. I've just parted with him in Gray's Inn Lane, and he says--that\nit's all up now with Lady Mason.\"\n\n\"Gammon!\" said Moulder. And on this occasion Mrs. Smiley did not\nrebuke him. \"What does he know about it more than any one else? Will\nhe bet two to one? Because, if so, I'll take it;--only I must see the\nmoney down.\"\n\n\"I don't know what he'll bet, Mr. Moulder; only he says it's all up\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Will he back his side, even handed?\"\n\n\"I ain't a betting man, Mr. Moulder. I don't think it's right. And on\nsuch a matter as this, touching the liberty and almost life of a lady\nwhom I've had the honour of seeing, and acquainted as I am with the\nlady of the other party, Mrs. Mason that is of Groby Park, I should\nrather, if it's no offence to you, decline the subject of--betting.\"\n\n\"Bother!\"\n\n\"Now M., in your own house, you know!\" said his wife.\n\n\"So it is bother. But never mind that. Go on, Kantwise. What is this\nyou were saying about Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's about all. I thought you would like to know what they\nwere doing,--particularly Mr. Kenneby. I do hear that they mean to be\nuncommonly hard upon him.\"\n\nThe unfortunate witness shifted uneasily in his seat, but at the\nmoment said nothing himself.\n\n\"Well, now, I can't understand it,\" said Mrs. Smiley, sitting upright\nin her chair, and tackling herself to the discussion as though she\nmeant to express her opinion, let who might think differently. \"How\nis any one to put words into my mouth if I don't choose to speak\nthen? There's John's waistcoat is silk.\" Upon which they all looked\nat Kenneby's waistcoat, and, with the exception of Kantwise,\nacknowledged the truth of the assertion.\n\n\"That's as may be,\" said he, looking round at it from the corner of\nhis eyes.\n\n\"And do you mean to say that all the barristers in London will make\nme say that it's made of cloth? It's ridic'lous--nothing short of\nridic'lous.\"\n\n\"You've never tried, my dear,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"I don't know about being your dear, Mr. Moulder--\"\n\n\"Nor yet don't I neither, Mrs. Smiley,\" said the wife.\n\n\"Mr. Kenneby's my dear, and I ain't ashamed to own him,--before men\nand women. But if he allows hisself to be hocussed in that way, I\ndon't know but what I shall be ashamed. I call it hocussing--just\nhocussing.\"\n\n\"So it is, ma'am,\" said Kantwise, \"only this, you know, if I hocus\nyou, why you hocus me in return; so it isn't so very unfair, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Unfair!\" said Moulder. \"It's the fairest thing that is. It's the\nbulwark of the British Constitution.\"\n\n\"What! being badgered and browbeat?\" asked Kenneby, who was thinking\nwithin himself that if this were so he did not care if he lived\nsomewhere beyond the protection of that blessed \u00c3\u0086gis.\n\n\"Trial by jury is,\" said Moulder. \"And how can you have trial by jury\nif the witnesses are not to be cross-questioned?\"\n\nTo this position no one was at the moment ready to give an answer,\nand Mr. Moulder enjoyed a triumph over his audience. That he lived\nin a happy and blessed country Moulder was well aware, and with\nthose blessings he did not wish any one to tamper. \"Mother,\" said a\nfastidious child to his parent, \"the bread is gritty and the butter\ntastes of turnips.\" \"Turnips indeed,--and gritty!\" said the mother.\n\"Is it not a great thing to have bread and butter at all?\" I own that\nmy sympathies are with the child. Bread and butter is a great thing;\nbut I would have it of the best if that be possible.\n\nAfter that Mr. Kantwise was allowed to dilate upon the subject\nwhich had brought him there. Mr. Dockwrath had been summoned to\nBedford Row, and there had held a council of war together with Mr.\nJoseph Mason and Mr. Matthew Round. According to his own story Mr.\nMatthew had quite come round and been forced to acknowledge all that\nDockwrath had done for the cause. In Bedford Row there was no doubt\nwhatever as to the verdict. \"That woman Bolster is quite clear that\nshe only signed one deed,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"I shall say nothing--nothing here,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"Quite right, John,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Your feelings on the occasion\nbecome you.\"\n\n\"I'll lay an even bet she's acquitted,\" said Moulder. \"And I'll do it\nin a ten-p'und note.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXII.\n\nWHAT THE FOUR LAWYERS THOUGHT ABOUT IT.\n\n\nI have spoken of the state of public opinion as to Lady Mason's\ncoming trial, and have explained that for the most part men's\nthoughts and sympathies took part with her. But I cannot say that\nsuch was the case with the thoughts of those who were most closely\nconcerned with her in the matter,--whatever may have been their\nsympathies. Of the state of Mr. Furnival's mind on the matter enough\nhas been said. But if he had still entertained any shadow of doubt\nas to his client's guilt or innocence, none whatever was entertained\neither by Mr. Aram or by Mr. Chaffanbrass. From the day on which they\nhad first gone into the real circumstances of the case, looking into\nthe evidence which could be adduced against their client, and looking\nalso to their means of rebutting that evidence, they had never felt\na shadow of doubt upon the subject. But yet neither of them had ever\nsaid that she was guilty. Aram, in discussing with his clerks the\nwork which it was necessary that they should do in the matter, had\nnever expressed such an opinion; nor had Chaffanbrass done so in the\nconsultations which he had held with Aram. As to the verdict they\nhad very often expressed an opinion--differing considerably. Mr.\nAram was strongly of opinion that Lady Mason would be acquitted,\nresting that opinion mainly on his great confidence in the powers\nof Mr. Chaffanbrass. But Mr. Chaffanbrass would shake his head, and\nsometimes say that things were not now as they used to be.\n\n\"That may be so in the City,\" said Mr. Aram. \"But you won't find a\nCity jury down at Alston.\"\n\n\"It's not the juries, Aram. It's the judges. It usedn't to be so,\nbut it is now. When a man has the last word, and will take the\ntrouble to use it, that's everything. If I were asked what point I'd\nbest like to have in my favour I'd say, a deaf judge. Or if not that,\none regularly tired out. I've sometimes thought I'd like to be a\njudge myself, merely to have the last word.\"\n\n\"That wouldn't suit you at all, Mr. Chaffanbrass, for you'd be sick\nof it in a week.\"\n\n\"At any rate I'm not fit for it,\" said the great man meekly. \"I'll\ntell you what, Aram, I can look back on life and think that I've done\na deal of good in my way. I've prevented unnecessary bloodshed. I've\nsaved the country thousands of pounds in the maintenance of men\nwho've shown themselves well able to maintain themselves. And I've\nmade the Crown lawyers very careful as to what sort of evidence they\nwould send up to the Old Bailey. But my chances of life have been\nsuch that they haven't made me fit to be a judge. I know that.\"\n\n\"I wish I might see you on the bench to-morrow;--only that we\nshouldn't know what to do without you,\" said the civil attorney. It\nwas no more than the fair every-day flattery of the world, for the\npractice of Mr. Solomon Aram in his profession was quite as surely\nattained as was that of Mr. Chaffanbrass. And it could hardly be\ncalled flattery, for Mr. Solomon Aram much valued the services of\nMr. Chaffanbrass, and greatly appreciated the peculiar turn of that\ngentleman's mind.\n\nThe above conversation took place in Mr. Solomon Aram's private room\nin Bucklersbury. In that much-noted city thoroughfare Mr. Aram rented\nthe first floor of a house over an eating establishment. He had no\ngreat paraphernalia of books and boxes and clerks' desks, as are\napparently necessary to attorneys in general. Three clerks he did\nemploy, who sat in one room, and he himself sat in that behind\nit. So at least they sat when they were to be found at the parent\nestablishment; but, as regarded the attorney himself and his senior\nassistant, the work of their lives was carried on chiefly in the\ncourts of law. The room in which Mr. Aram was now sitting was\nfurnished with much more attention to comfort than is usual in\nlawyers' chambers. Mr. Chaffanbrass was at present lying, with his\nfeet up, on a sofa against the wall, in a position of comfort never\nattained by him elsewhere till the after-dinner hours had come to\nhim; and Mr. Aram himself filled an easy lounging-chair. Some few law\npapers there were scattered on the library table, but none of those\npiles of dusty documents which give to a stranger, on entering an\nordinary attorney's room, so terrible an idea of the difficulty and\ndreariness of the profession. There were no tin boxes with old names\nlabelled on them; there were no piles of letters, and no pigeon-holes\nloaded with old memoranda. On the whole Mr. Aram's private room was\nsmart and attractive; though, like himself, it had an air rather of\npretence than of steady and assured well-being.\n\n[Illustration: Mr. Chaffanbrass and Mr. Solomon Aram.]\n\nIt is not quite the thing for a barrister to wait upon an attorney,\nand therefore it must not be supposed that Mr. Chaffanbrass had come\nto Mr. Aram with any view to immediate business; but nevertheless, as\nthe two men understood each other, they could say what they had to\nsay as to this case of Lady Mason's, although their present positions\nwere somewhat irregular. They were both to meet Mr. Furnival and\nFelix Graham on that afternoon in Mr. Furnival's chambers with\nreference to the division of those labours which were to be commenced\nat Alston on the day but one following, and they both thought that\nit might be as well that they should say a word to each other on the\nsubject before they went there.\n\n\"I suppose you know nothing about the panel down there, eh?\" said\nChaffanbrass.\n\n\"Well, I have made some inquiries; but I don't think there's\nanything especial to know;--nothing that matters. If I were you, Mr.\nChaffanbrass, I wouldn't have any Hamworth people on the jury, for\nthey say that a prophet is never a prophet in his own country.\"\n\n\"But do you know the Hamworth people?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I can tell you as much as that. But I don't think it will\nmatter much who is or is not on the jury.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\n\"If those two witnesses break down--that is, Kenneby and Bolster, no\njury can convict her. And if they don't--\"\n\n\"Then no jury can acquit her. But let me tell you, Aram, that it's\nnot every man put into a jury-box who can tell whether a witness has\nbroken down or not.\"\n\n\"But from what I hear, Mr. Chaffanbrass, I don't think either of\nthese can stand a chance;--that is, if they both come into your\nhands.\"\n\n\"But they won't both come into my hands,\" said the anxious hero of\nthe Old Bailey.\n\n\"Ah! that's where it is. That's where we shall fail. Mr. Furnival is\na great man, no doubt.\"\n\n\"A very great man,--in his way,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n\"But if he lets one of those two slip through his fingers the thing's\nover.\"\n\n\"You know my opinion,\" said Chaffanbrass. \"I think it is all over. If\nyou're right in what you say,--that they're both ready to swear in\ntheir direct evidence that they only signed one deed on that day, no\nvacillation afterwards would have any effect on the judge. It's just\npossible, you know, that their memory might deceive them.\"\n\n\"Possible! I should think so. I'll tell you what, Mr. Chaffanbrass,\nif the matter was altogether in your hands I should have no\nfear,--literally no fear.\"\n\n\"Ah, you're partial, Aram.\"\n\n\"It couldn't be so managed, could it, Mr. Chaffanbrass? It would be a\ngreat thing; a very great thing.\" But Mr. Chaffanbrass said that he\nthought it could not be managed. The success or safety of a client\nis a very great thing;--in a professional point of view a very\ngreat thing indeed. But there is a matter which in legal eyes is\ngreater even than that. Professional etiquette required that the\ncross-examination of these two most important witnesses should not be\nleft in the hands of the same barrister.\n\nAnd then the special attributes of Kenneby and Bridget Bolster were\ndiscussed between them, and it was manifest that Aram knew with great\naccuracy the characters of the persons with whom he had to deal. That\nKenneby might be made to say almost anything was taken for granted.\nWith him there would be very great scope for that peculiar skill with\nwhich Mr. Chaffanbrass was so wonderfully gifted. In the hands of\nMr. Chaffanbrass it was not improbable that Kenneby might be made to\nswear that he had signed two, three, four--any number of documents\non that fourteenth of July, although he had before sworn that he had\nonly signed one. Mr. Chaffanbrass indeed might probably make him\nsay anything that he pleased. Had Kenneby been unsupported the case\nwould have been made safe,--so said Mr. Solomon Aram,--by leaving\nKenneby in the hands of Mr. Chaffanbrass. But then Bridget Bolster\nwas supposed to be a witness of altogether a different class of\ncharacter. To induce her to say exactly the reverse of that which she\nintended to say might, no doubt, be within the power of man. Mr. Aram\nthought that it would be within the power of Mr. Chaffanbrass. He\nthought, however, that it would as certainly be beyond the power of\nMr. Furnival; and when the great man lying on the sofa mentioned the\nname of Mr. Felix Graham, Mr. Aram merely smiled. The question with\nhim was this:--Which would be the safest course?--to make quite sure\nof Kenneby by leaving him with Chaffanbrass; or to go for the double\nstake by handing Kenneby over to Mr. Furnival and leaving the task of\ndifficulty to the great master?\n\n\"When so much depends upon it, I do detest all this etiquette and\nprecedence,\" said Aram with enthusiasm. \"In such a case Mr. Furnival\nought not to think of himself.\"\n\n\"My dear Aram,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass, \"men always think of\nthemselves first. And if we were to go out of the usual course, do\nyou conceive that the gentlemen on the other side would fail to\nnotice it?\"\n\n\"Which shall it be then?\"\n\n\"I'm quite indifferent. If the memory of either of these two persons\nis doubtful,--and after twenty years it may be so,--Mr. Furnival will\ndiscover it.\"\n\n\"Then on the whole I'm disposed to think that I'd let him take the\nman.\"\n\n\"Just as you please, Aram. That is, if he's satisfied also.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to have my client overthrown, you know,\" said Aram.\n\"And then you'll take Dockwrath also, of course. I don't know that\nit will have much effect upon the case, but I shall like to see\nDockwrath in your hands; I shall indeed.\"\n\n\"I doubt he'll be too many for me.\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" Aram might well laugh; for when had any one shown\nhimself able to withstand the powers of Mr. Chaffanbrass?\n\n\"They say he is a sharp fellow,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass. \"Well, we\nmust be off. When those gentlemen at the West End get into Parliament\nit does not do to keep them waiting. Let one of your fellows get\na cab.\" And then the barrister and the attorney started from\nBucklersbury for the general meeting of their forces to be held in\nthe Old Square, Lincoln's Inn.\n\nWe have heard how it came to pass that Felix Graham had been induced\nto become one of that legal phalanx which was employed on behalf of\nLady Mason. It was now some days since he had left Noningsby, and\nthose days with him had been very busy. He had never yet undertaken\nthe defence of a person in a criminal court, and had much to\nlearn,--or perhaps he rather fancied that he had. And then that\naffair of Mary Snow's new lover was not found to arrange itself\naltogether easily. When he came to the details of his dealings with\nthe different parties, every one wanted from him twice as much money\nas he had expected. The chemist was very willing to have a partner,\nbut then a partnership in his business was, according to his view\nof the matter, a peculiarly expensive luxury. Snow p\u00c3\u00a8re, moreover,\ncame forward with claims which he rested on various arguments, that\nGraham found it almost impossible to resist them. At first,--that is\nimmediately subsequent to the interview between him and his patron\ndescribed in a preceding chapter, Graham had been visited by a very\nrepulsive attorney who had talked loudly about the cruel wrongs of\nhis ill-used client. This phasis of the affair would have been by\nfar the preferable one; but the attorney and his client probably\ndisagreed. Snow wanted immediate money, and as no immediate money\nwas forthcoming through the attorney, he threw himself repentant at\nGraham's feet, and took himself off with twenty shillings. But his\npenitence, and his wants, and his tears, and the thwarted ambition\nof his parental mind were endless; and poor Felix hardly knew where\nto turn himself without seeing him. It seemed probable that every\ndenizen of the courts of law in London would be told before long\nthe sad tale of Mary Snow's injuries. And then Mrs. Thomas wanted\nmoney,--more money than she had a right to want in accordance with\nthe terms of their mutual agreement. \"She had been very much put\nabout,\" she said,--\"dreadfully put about. She had had to change her\nservant three times. There was no knowing the trouble Mary Snow had\ngiven her. She had, in a great measure, been forced to sacrifice her\nschool.\" Poor woman! she thought she was telling the truth while\nmaking these false plaints. She did not mean to be dishonest, but it\nis so easy to be dishonest without meaning it when one is very poor!\nMary Snow herself made no claim on her lost lover, no claim for money\nor for aught besides. When he parted from her on that day without\nkissing her, Mary Snow knew that all that was over. But not the less\ndid Graham recognise her claim. The very bonnet which she must wear\nwhen she stood before the altar with Fitzallen must be paid for out\nof Graham's pocket. That hobby of moulding a young lady is perhaps of\nall hobbies the most expensive to which a young gentleman can apply\nhimself.\n\nAnd in these days he heard no word from Noningsby. Augustus Staveley\nwas up in town, and once or twice they saw each other. But, as may\neasily be imagined, nothing was said between them about Madeline. As\nAugustus had once declared, a man does not talk to his friend about\nhis own sister. And then hearing nothing--as indeed how could he\nhave heard anything?--Graham endeavoured to assure himself that that\nwas all over. His hopes had ran high at that moment when his last\ninterview with the judge had taken place; but after all to what did\nthat amount? He had never even asked Madeline to love him. He had\nbeen such a fool that he had made no use of those opportunities which\nchance had thrown in his way. He had been told that he might fairly\naspire to the hand of any lady. And yet when he had really loved, and\nthe girl whom he had loved had been close to him, he had not dared\nto speak to her! How could he now expect that she, in his absence,\nshould care for him?\n\nWith all these little troubles around him he went to work on Lady\nMason's case, and at first felt thoroughly well inclined to give her\nall the aid in his power. He saw Mr. Furnival on different occasions,\nand did much to charm that gentleman by his enthusiasm in this\nmatter. Mr. Furnival himself could no longer be as enthusiastic as he\nhad been. The skill of a lawyer he would still give if necessary, but\nthe ardour of the loving friend was waxing colder from day to day.\nWould it not be better, if such might be possible, that the whole\naffair should be given up to the hands of Chaffanbrass who could be\nenergetic without belief, and of Graham who was energetic because\nhe believed? So he would say to himself frequently. But then he\nwould think again of her pale face and acknowledge that this was\nimpossible. He must go on till the end. But, nevertheless, if this\nyoung man could believe, would it not be well that he should bear the\nbrunt of the battle? That fighting of a battle without belief is, I\nthink, the sorriest task which ever falls to the lot of any man.\n\nBut, as the day grew nigh, a shadow of unbelief, a dim passing\nshade--a shade which would pass, and then return, and then pass\nagain--flitted also across the mind of Felix Graham. His theory had\nbeen, and still was, that those two witnesses, Kenneby and Bolster,\nwere suborned by Dockwrath to swear falsely. He had commenced\nby looking at the matter with a full confidence in his client's\ninnocence, a confidence which had come from the outer world, from his\nsocial convictions, and the knowledge which he had of the confidence\nof others. Then it had been necessary for him to reconcile the\nstories which Kenneby and Bolster were prepared to tell with this\nstrong confidence, and he could only do so by believing that they\nwere both false and had been thus suborned. But what if they were not\nfalse? What if he were judging them wrongfully? I do not say that\nhe had ceased to believe in Lady Mason; but a shadow of doubt would\noccasionally cross his mind, and give to the whole affair an aspect\nwhich to him was very tragical.\n\nHe had reached Mr. Furnival's chambers on this day some few minutes\nbefore his new allies, and as he was seated there discussing the\nmatter which was now so interesting to them all, he blurted out a\nquestion which nearly confounded the elder barrister.\n\n\"I suppose there can really be no doubt as to her innocence?\"\n\nWhat was Mr. Furnival to say? Mr. Chaffanbrass and Mr. Aram had asked\nno such question. Mr. Round had asked no such question when he had\ndiscussed the whole matter confidentially with him. It was a sort of\nquestion never put to professional men, and one which Felix Graham\nshould not have asked. Nevertheless it must be answered.\n\n\"Eh?\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose we may take it for granted that Lady Mason is really\ninnocent,--that is, free from all falsehood or fraud in this matter?\"\n\n\"Really innocent! Oh yes; I presume we take that for granted, as a\nmatter of course.\"\n\n\"But you yourself, Mr. Furnival; you have no doubt about it? You have\nbeen concerned in this matter from the beginning, and therefore I\nhave no hesitation in asking you.\"\n\nBut that was exactly the reason why he should have hesitated! At\nleast so Mr. Furnival thought. \"Who; I? No; I have no doubt; none in\nthe least,\" said he. And thus the lie, which he had been trying to\navoid, was at last told.\n\nThe assurance thus given was very complete as far as the words were\nconcerned; but there was something in the tone of Mr. Furnival's\nvoice, which did not quite satisfy Felix Graham. It was not that he\nthought that Mr. Furnival had spoken falsely, but the answer had not\nbeen made in a manner to set his own mind at rest. Why had not Mr.\nFurnival answered him with enthusiasm? Why had he not, on behalf of\nhis old friend, shown something like indignation that any such doubt\nshould have been expressed? His words had been words of assurance;\nbut, considering the subject, his tone had contained no assurance.\nAnd thus the shadow of doubt flitted backwards and forwards before\nGraham's mind.\n\nThen the general meeting of the four lawyers was held, and the\nvarious arrangements necessary for the coming contest were settled.\nNo such impertinent questions were asked then, nor were there\nany communications between them of a confidential nature. Mr.\nChaffanbrass and Solomon Aram might whisper together, as might also\nMr. Furnival and Felix Graham; but there could be no whispering\nwhen all the four were assembled. The programme of their battle was\nsettled, and then they parted with the understanding that they were\nto meet again in the court-house at Alston.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII.\n\nTHE EVENING BEFORE THE TRIAL.\n\n\nThe eve of the trial had now come, and still there had been no\nconfidence between the mother and the son. No words of kindness had\nbeen spoken with reference to that terrible event which was so near\nat hand. Lucius had in his manner been courteous to his mother, but\nhe had at the same time been very stern. He had seemed to make no\nallowance for her sorrows, never saying to her one of those soft\nwords which we all love to hear from those around us when we are\nsuffering. Why should she suffer thus? Had she chosen to lean upon\nhim, he would have borne on her behalf all this trouble and vexation.\nAs to her being guilty--as to her being found guilty by any twelve\njurymen in England,--no such idea ever entered his head. I have said\nthat many people had begun to suspect; but no such suspicions had\nreached his ears. What man, unless it should be Dockwrath, would\nwhisper to the son the possibility of his mother's guilt? Dockwrath\nhad done more than whisper it; but the words of such a man could have\nno avail with him against his mother's character.\n\nOn that day Mrs. Orme had been with Lady Mason for some hours, and\nhad used all her eloquence to induce the mother even then to divulge\nher secret to her son. Mrs. Orme had suggested that Sir Peregrine\nshould tell him; she had offered to tell him herself; she had\nproposed that Lady Mason should write to Lucius. But all had been of\nno avail. Lady Mason had argued, and had argued with some truth, that\nit was too late to tell him now, with the view of obtaining from him\nsupport during the trial. If he were now told, he would not recover\nfrom the first shock of the blow in time to appear in court without\nshowing on his brow the perturbation of his spirit. His terrible\ngrief would reveal the secret to every one. \"When it is over,\"--she\nhad whispered at last, as Mrs. Orme continued to press upon her the\nabsolute necessity that Lucius should give up the property,--\"when it\nis over, you shall do it.\"\n\nWith this Mrs. Orme was obliged to rest contented. She had not the\nheart to remind Lady Mason how probable it was that the truth might\nbe told out to all the world during the next two or three days;--that\na verdict of Guilty might make any further telling unnecessary. And\nindeed it was not needed that she should do so. In this respect Lady\nMason was fully aware of the nature of the ground on which she stood.\n\nMrs. Orme had sat with her the whole afternoon, only leaving herself\ntime to be ready for Sir Peregrine's dinner; and as she left her she\npromised to be with her early on the following morning to go with her\ndown to the court. Mr. Aram was also to come to the Farm for her, and\na closed carriage had been ordered from the inn for the occasion.\n\n\"You won't let him prevent you?\" were the last words she spoke, as\nMrs. Orme then left her.\n\n\"He will not wish to do so,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"He has already given me\nhis permission. He never goes back from his word, you know.\"\n\nThis had been said in allusion to Sir Peregrine. When Mrs. Orme had\nfirst proposed to accompany Lady Mason to the court and to sit by her\nside during the whole trial, he had been much startled. He had been\nstartled, and for a time had been very unwilling to accede to such\na step. The place which she now proposed to fill was one which he\nhad intended to fill himself;--but he had intended to stand by an\ninnocent, injured lady, not a perpetrator of midnight forgery. He\nhad intended to support a spotless being, who would then be his\nwife,--not a woman who for years had lived on the proceeds of fraud\nand felony, committed by herself!\n\n\"Edith,\" he had said, \"you know that I am unwilling to oppose you;\nbut I think that in this your feelings are carrying you too far.\"\n\n\"No, father,\" she answered, not giving way at all, or showing herself\nminded to be turned from her purpose by anything he might say.\n\"Do not think so; think of her misery. How could she endure it by\nherself?\"\n\n\"Think of her guilt, Edith!\"\n\n\"I will leave others to think of that. But, father, her guilt will\nnot stain me. Are we not bound to remember what injury she might\nhave done to us, and how we might still have been ignorant of all\nthis, had not she herself confessed it--for our sakes--for our sakes,\nfather?\"\n\nAnd then Sir Peregrine gave way. When this argument was used to him,\nhe was forced to yield. It was true that, had not that woman been as\ngenerous as she was guilty, he would now have been bound to share her\nshame. The whole of this affair, taken together, had nearly laid him\nprostrate; but that which had gone the farthest towards effecting\nthis ruin, was the feeling that he owed so much to Lady Mason. As\nregarded the outer world, the injury to him would have been much more\nterrible had he married her; men would then have declared that all\nwas over with him; but as regards the inner man, I doubt whether he\nwould not have borne that better. It was easier for him to sustain\nan injury than a favour,--than a favour from one whom his judgment\ncompelled him to disown as a friend.\n\nBut he had given way, and it was understood at The Cleeve that Mrs.\nOrme was to remain by Lady Mason's side during the trial. To the\ngeneral household there was nothing in this that was wonderful. They\nknew only of the old friendship. To them the question of her guilt\nwas still an open question. As others had begun to doubt, so had\nthey; but no one then presumed that Sir Peregrine or Mrs. Orme had\nany doubt. That they were assured of her innocence was the conviction\nof all Hamworth and its neighbourhood.\n\n\"He never goes back from his word, you know,\" Mrs. Orme had said;\nand then she kissed Lady Mason, and went her way. She had never left\nher without a kiss, had never greeted her without a warm pressure of\nthe hand, since that day on which the secret had been told in Sir\nPeregrine's library. It would be impossible to describe how great\nhad been the worth of this affection to Lady Mason; but it may\nalmost be said that it had kept her alive. She herself had said but\nlittle about it, uttering but few thanks; but not the less had she\nrecognised the value of what had been done for her. She had even\nbecome more free herself in her intercourse with Mrs. Orme,--more\nopen in her mode of speech,--had put herself more on an equality with\nher friend, since there had ceased to be anything hidden between\nthem. Previously Lady Mason had felt, and had occasionally expressed\nthe feeling, that she was hardly fit to associate on equal terms with\nMrs. Orme; but now there was none of this,--now, as they sat together\nfor hours and hours, they spoke, and argued, and lived together as\nthough they were equal. But nevertheless, could she have shown her\nlove by any great deed, there was nothing which Lady Mason would not\nhave done for Mrs. Orme.\n\nShe was now left alone, and according to her daily custom would\nremain there till the servant told her that Mr. Lucius was waiting\nfor her in the dining-room. In an early part of this story I have\nendeavoured to describe how this woman sat alone, with deep sorrow in\nher heart and deep thought on her mind, when she first learned what\nterrible things were coming on her. The idea, however, which the\nreader will have conceived of her as she sat there will have come\nto him from the skill of the artist, and not from the words of the\nwriter. If that drawing is now near him, let him go back to it. Lady\nMason was again sitting in the same room--that pleasant room, looking\nout through the verandah on to the sloping lawn, and in the same\nchair; one hand again rested open on the arm of the chair, while the\nother supported her face as she leaned upon her elbow; and the sorrow\nwas still in her heart, and the deep thought in her mind. But the\nlines of her face were altered, and the spirit expressed by it was\nchanged. There was less of beauty, less of charm, less of softness;\nbut in spite of all that she had gone through there was more of\nstrength,--more of the power to resist all that this world could do\nto her.\n\nIt would be wrong to say that she was in any degree a hypocrite. A\nman is no more a hypocrite because his manner and gait when he is\nalone are different from those which he assumes in company, than he\nis for wearing a dressing-gown in the morning, whereas he puts on a\nblack coat in the evening. Lady Mason in the present crisis of her\nlife endeavoured to be true in all her dealings with Mrs. Orme; but\nnevertheless Mrs. Orme had not yet read her character. As she now sat\nthinking of what the morrow would bring upon her,--thinking of all\nthat the malice of that man Dockwrath had brought upon her,--she\nresolved that she would still struggle on with a bold front. It\nhad been brought home to her that he, her son, the being for whom\nher soul had been imperilled, and all her hopes for this world\ndestroyed,--that he must be told of his mother's guilt and shame. Let\nhim be told, and then let him leave her while his anguish and the\nfeeling of his shame were hot upon him. Should she be still a free\nwoman when this trial was over she would move herself away at once,\nand then let him be told. But still it would be well--well for his\nsake, that his mother should not be found guilty by the law. It was\nstill worth her while to struggle. The world was very hard to her,\nbruising her to the very soul at every turn, allowing her no hope,\noffering to her no drop of cool water in her thirst. But still for\nhim there was some future career; and that career perhaps need not be\nblotted by the public notice of his mother's guilt. She would still\nfight against her foes,--still show to that court, and to the world\nthat would then gaze at her, a front on which guilt should not seem\nto have laid its hideous, defacing hand.\n\nThere was much that was wonderful about this woman. While she was\nwith those who regarded her with kindness she could be so soft and\nwomanly; and then, when alone, she could be so stern and hard! And\nit may be said that she felt but little pity for herself. Though she\nrecognised the extent of her misery, she did not complain of it. Even\nin her inmost thoughts her plaint was this,--that he, her son, should\nbe doomed to suffer so deeply for her sin! Sometimes she would utter\nto that other mother a word of wailing, in that he would not be soft\nto her; but even in that she did not mean to complain of him. She\nknew in her heart of hearts that she had no right to expect such\nsoftness. She knew that it was better that it should be as it now\nwas. Had he stayed with her from morn till evening, speaking kind\nwords to her, how could she have failed to tell him? In sickness it\nmay irk us because we are not allowed to take the cool drink that\nwould be grateful; but what man in his senses would willingly swallow\nthat by which his very life would be endangered? It was thus she\nthought of her son, and what his love might have been to her.\n\nYes; she would still bear up, as she had borne up at that other\ntrial. She would dress herself with care, and go down into the court\nwith a smooth brow. Men, as they looked at her, should not at once\nsay, \"Behold the face of a guilty woman!\" There was still a chance\nin the battle, though the odds were so tremendously against her. It\nmight be that there was but little to which she could look forward,\neven though the verdict of the jury should be in her favour; but all\nthat she regarded as removed from her by a great interval. She had\npromised that Lucius should know all after the trial,--that he should\nknow all, so that the property might be restored to its rightful\nowner; and she was fully resolved that this promise should be kept.\nBut nevertheless there was a long interval. If she could battle\nthrough this first danger,--if by the skill of her lawyers she could\navert the public declaration of her guilt, might not the chances of\nwar still take some further turn in her favour? And thus, though\nher face was pale with suffering and thin with care, though she\nhad realised the fact that nothing short of a miracle could save\nher,--still she would hope for that miracle.\n\nBut the absolute bodily labour which she was forced to endure was so\nhard upon her! She would dress herself, and smooth her brow for the\ntrial; but that dressing herself, and that maintenance of a smooth\nbrow would impose upon her an amount of toil which would almost\novertask her physical strength. O reader, have you ever known what it\nis to rouse yourself and go out to the world on your daily business,\nwhen all the inner man has revolted against work, when a day of rest\nhas seemed to you to be worth a year of life? If she could have\nrested now, it would have been worth many years of life,--worth all\nher life. She longed for rest,--to be able to lay aside the terrible\nfatigue of being ever on the watch. From the burden of that necessity\nshe had never been free since her crime had been first committed.\nShe had never known true rest. She had not once trusted herself to\nsleep without the feeling that her first waking thought would be\none of horror, as the remembrance of her position came upon her. In\nevery word she spoke, in every trifling action of her life, it was\nnecessary that she should ask herself how that word and action might\ntell upon her chances of escape. She had striven to be true and\nhonest,--true and honest with the exception of that one deed. But\nthat one deed had communicated its poison to her whole life. Truth\nand honesty,--fair, unblemished truth and open-handed, fearless\nhonesty,--had been impossible to her. Before she could be true and\nhonest it would be necessary that she should go back and cleanse\nherself from the poison of that deed. Such cleansing is to be done.\nMen have sinned deep as she had sinned, and, lepers though they have\nbeen, they have afterwards been clean. But that task of cleansing\noneself is not an easy one;--the waters of that Jordan in which it is\nneedful to wash are scalding hot. The cool neighbouring streams of\nlife's pleasant valleys will by no means suffice.\n\nSince she had been home at Orley Farm she had been very scrupulous\nas to going down into the parlour both at breakfast and at dinner,\nso that she might take her meals with her son. She had not as yet\nomitted this on one occasion, although sometimes the task of sitting\nthrough the dinner was very severe upon her. On the present occasion,\nthe last day that remained to her before the trial--perhaps the last\nevening on which she would ever watch the sun set from those windows,\nshe thought that she would spare herself. \"Tell Mr. Lucius,\" she said\nto the servant who came to summon her, \"that I would be obliged to\nhim if he would sit down without me. Tell him that I am not ill, but\nthat I would rather not go down to dinner!\" But before the girl was\non the stairs she had changed her mind. Why should she now ask for\nthis mercy? What did it matter? So she gathered herself up from the\nchair, and going forth from the room, stopped the message before it\nwas delivered. She would bear on to the end.\n\nShe sat through the dinner, and answered the ordinary questions\nwhich Lucius put to her with her ordinary voice, and then, as was\nher custom, she kissed his brow as she left the room. It must be\nremembered that they were still mother and son, and that there had\nbeen no quarrel between them. And now, as she went up stairs, he\nfollowed her into the drawing-room. His custom had been to remain\nbelow, and though he had usually seen her again during the evening,\nthere had seldom or never been any social intercourse between them.\nOn the present occasion, however, he followed her, and closing the\ndoor for her as he entered the room, he sat himself down on the sofa,\nclose to her chair.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, putting out his hand and touching her arm, \"things\nbetween us are not as they should be.\"\n\nShe shuddered, not at the touch, but at the words. Things were not as\nthey should be between them. \"No,\" she said. \"But I am sure of this,\nLucius, that you never had an unkind thought in your heart towards\nme.\"\n\n\"Never, mother. How could I,--to my own mother, who has ever been so\ngood to me? But for the last three months we have been to each other\nnearly as though we were strangers.\"\n\n\"But we have loved each other all the same,\" said she.\n\n\"But love should beget close social intimacy, and above all close\nconfidence in times of sorrow. There has been none such between us.\"\n\nWhat could she say to him? It was on her lips to promise him that\nsuch love should again prevail between them as soon as this trial\nshould be over; but the words stuck in her throat. She did not dare\nto give him so false an assurance. \"Dear Lucius,\" she said, \"if it\nhas been my fault, I have suffered for it.\"\n\n\"I do not say that it is your fault;--nor will I say that it has been\nmy own. If I have seemed harsh to you, I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"No, Lucius, no; you have not been harsh. I have understood you\nthrough it all.\"\n\n\"I have been grieved because you did not seem to trust me;--but let\nthat pass now. Mother, I wish that there may be no unpleasant feeling\nbetween us when you enter on this ordeal to-morrow.\"\n\n\"There is none;--there shall be none.\"\n\n\"No one can feel more keenly,--no one can feel so keenly as I do, the\ncruelty with which you are treated. The sight of your sorrow has made\nme wretched.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucius!\"\n\n\"I know how pure and innocent you are--\"\n\n\"No, Lucius, no.\"\n\n\"But I say yes; and knowing that, it has cut me to the quick to see\nthem going about a defence of your innocence by quips and quibbles,\nas though they were struggling for the escape of a criminal.\"\n\n\"Lucius!\" And she put her hands up, praying for mercy, though she\ncould not explain to him how terribly severe were his words.\n\n\"Wait a moment, mother. To me such men as Mr. Chaffanbrass and his\ncomrades are odious. I will not, and do not believe that their\nservices are necessary to you--\"\n\n\"But, Lucius, Mr. Furnival--\"\n\n\"Yes; Mr. Furnival! It is he that has done it all. In my heart I wish\nthat you had never known Mr. Furnival;--never known him as a lawyer\nthat is,\" he added, thinking of his own strong love for the lawyer's\ndaughter.\n\n\"Do not upbraid me now, Lucius. Wait till it is all over.\"\n\n\"Upbraid you! No. I have come to you now that we may be friends.\nAs things have gone so far, this plan of defence must of course be\ncarried on. I will say no more about that. But, mother, I will go\ninto the court with you to-morrow. That support I can at any rate\ngive you, and they shall see that there is no quarrel between us.\"\n\nBut Lady Mason did not desire this. She would have wished that he\nmight have been miles away from the court had that been possible.\n\"Mrs. Orme is to be with me,\" she said.\n\nThen again there came a black frown upon his brow,--a frown such as\nthere had often been there of late. \"And will Mrs. Orme's presence\nmake the attendance of your own son improper?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; of course not. I did not mean that, Lucius.\"\n\n\"Do you not like to have me near you?\" he asked; and as he spoke he\nrose up, and took her hand as he stood before her.\n\nShe gazed for a moment into his face while the tears streamed down\nfrom her eyes, and then rising from her chair, she threw herself on\nto his bosom and clasped him in her arms. \"My boy! my boy!\" she said.\n\"Oh, if you could be near me, and away from this--away from this!\"\n\nShe had not intended thus to give way, but the temptation had been\ntoo strong for her. When she had seen Mrs. Orme and Peregrine\ntogether,--when she had heard Peregrine's mother, with words\nexpressed in a joyful tone, affect to complain of the inroads which\nher son made upon her, she had envied her that joy. \"Oh, if it could\nbe so with me also!\" she always thought; and the words too had more\nthan once been spoken. Now at last, in this last moment, as it might\nbe, of her life at home, he had come to her with kindly voice, and\nshe could not repress her yearning.\n\n\"Lucius,\" she said; \"dearest Lucius! my own boy!\" And then the tears\nfrom her eyes streamed hot on to his bosom.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"it shall be so. I will be with you.\"\n\nBut she was now thinking of more than this--of much more. Was it\npossible for her to tell him now? As she held him in her arms, hiding\nher face upon his breast, she struggled hard to speak the word. Then\nin the midst of that struggle, while there was still something like a\nhope within her that it might be done, she raised her head and looked\nup into his face. It was not a face pleasant to look at, as was that\nof Peregrine Orme. It was hard in its outlines, and perhaps too manly\nfor his age. But she was his mother, and she loved it well. She\nlooked up at it, and raising her hands she stroked his cheeks. She\nthen kissed him again and again, with warm, clinging kisses. She\nclung to him, holding him close to her, while the sobs which she had\nso long repressed came forth from her with a violence that terrified\nhim. Then again she looked up into his face with one long wishful\ngaze; and after that she sank upon the sofa and hid her face within\nher hands. She had made the struggle, but it had been of no avail.\nShe could not tell him that tale with her own voice.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"what does this mean? I cannot understand such\ngrief as this.\" But for a while she was quite unable to answer. The\nflood-gates were at length opened, and she could not restrain the\ntorrent of her sobbings.\n\n\"You do not understand how weak a woman can be,\" she said at last.\n\nBut in truth he understood nothing of a woman's strength. He sat down\nby her, now and then taking her by the hand when she would leave it\nto him, and in his way endeavoured to comfort her. All comfort, we\nmay say, was out of the question; but by degrees she again became\ntranquil. \"It shall be to-morrow as you will have it. You will not\nobject to her being with me also?\"\n\nHe did object, but he could not say so. He would have much preferred\nto be the only friend near to her, but he felt that he could not\ndeny her the solace of a woman's aid and a woman's countenance. \"Oh\nno,\" he said, \"if you wish it.\" He would have found it impossible to\ndefine even to himself the reason for his dislike to any assistance\ncoming from the family of the Ormes; but the feeling was there,\nstrong within his bosom.\n\n\"And when this is over, mother, we will go away,\" he said. \"If you\nwould wish to live elsewhere, I will sell the property. It will be\nbetter perhaps after all that has passed. We will go abroad for a\nwhile.\"\n\nShe could make no answer to this except pressing his hand. Ah, if\nhe had been told--if she had allowed Mrs. Orme to do that kindness\nfor her, how much better for her would it now have been! Sell the\nproperty! Ah, me! Were they not words of fearful sound in her\nears,--words of terrible import?\n\n\"Yes, it shall be so,\" she said, putting aside that last proposition\nof his. \"We will go together to-morrow. Mr. Aram said that he would\nsit at my side, but he cannot object to your being there between us.\"\nMr. Aram's name was odious to Lucius Mason. His close presence would\nbe odious to him. But he felt that he could urge nothing against an\narrangement that had now become necessary. Mr. Aram, with all his\nquibbles, had been engaged, and the trial must now be carried through\nwith all the Aram tactics.\n\nAfter that Lucius left his mother, and took himself out into the dark\nnight, walking up and down on the road between his house and the\nouter gate, endeavouring to understand why his mother should be so\ndespondent. That she must fear the result of the trial, he thought,\nwas certain, but he could not bring himself to have any such fear. As\nto any suspicion of her guilt,--no such idea had even for one moment\ncast a shadow upon his peace of mind.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV.\n\nTHE FIRST JOURNEY TO ALSTON.\n\n\nAt that time Sir Richard Leatherham was the Solicitor-general, and\nhe had been retained as leading counsel for the prosecution. It was\nquite understood by all men who did understand what was going on in\nthe world, that this trial had been in truth instituted by Mr. Mason\nof Groby with the hope of recovering the property which had been left\naway from him by his father's will. The whole matter had now been so\nmuch discussed, that the true bearings of it were publicly known. If\non the former trial Lady Mason had sworn falsely, then there could be\nno doubt that that will, or the codicil to the will, was an untrue\ndocument, and the property would in that case revert to Mr. Mason,\nafter such further legal exercitations on the subject as the lawyers\nmight find necessary and profitable. As far as the public were\nconcerned, and as far as the Masons were concerned, it was known and\nacknowledged that this was another struggle on the part of the Groby\nPark family to regain the Orley Farm estate. But then the question\nhad become much more interesting than it had been in the days of the\nold trial, through the allegation which was now made of Lady Mason's\nguilt. Had the matter gone against her in the former trial, her child\nwould have lost the property, and that would have been all. But\nthe present issue would be very different. It would be much more\ntragical, and therefore of much deeper interest.\n\nAs Alston was so near to London, Sir Richard, Mr. Furnival,\nMr. Chaffanbrass, and others, were able to go up and down by\ntrain,--which arrangement was at ordinary assizes a great heartsore\nto the hotel-keepers and owners of lodging-houses in Alston. But on\nthis occasion the town was quite full in spite of this facility. The\nattorneys did not feel it safe to run up and down in that way, nor\ndid the witnesses. Mr. Aram remained, as did also Mr. Mat Round.\nSpecial accommodation had been provided for John Kenneby and Bridget\nBolster, and Mr. Mason of Groby had lodgings of his own.\n\nMr. Mason of Groby had suggested to the attorneys in Bedford Row that\nhis services as a witness would probably be required, but they had\nseemed to think otherwise. \"We shall not call you,\" Mr. Round had\nsaid, \"and I do not suppose that the other side will do so. They\ncan't if they do not first serve you.\" But in spite of this Mr. Mason\nhad determined to be at Alston. If it were true that this woman had\nrobbed him;--if it could be proved that she had really forged a will,\nand then by crime of the deepest dye taken from him for years that\nwhich was his own, should he not be there to see? Should he not be a\nwitness to her disgrace? Should he not be the first to know and feel\nhis own tardy triumph? Pity! Pity for her! When such a word was named\nto him, it seemed to him as though the speaker were becoming to a\ncertain extent a partner in her guilt. Pity! Yes; such pity as an\nEnglishman who had caught the Nana Sahib might have felt for his\nvictim. He had complained twenty times since this matter had been\nmooted of the folly of those who had altered the old laws. That folly\nhad probably robbed him of his property for twenty years, and would\nnow rob him of half his revenge. Not that he ever spoke even to\nhimself of revenge. \"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.\" He would\nhave been as able as any man to quote the words, and as willing.\nJustice, outraged justice, was his theme. Whom had he ever robbed? To\nwhom had he not paid all that was owing? \"All that have I done from\nmy youth upwards.\" Such were his thoughts of himself; and with such\nthoughts was it possible that he should willingly be absent from\nAlston during such a trial?\n\n\"I really would stay away if I were you,\" Mat Round had said to him.\n\n\"I will not stay away,\" he had replied, with a look black as a\nthundercloud. Could there really be anything in those suspicions of\nDockwrath, that his own lawyer had wilfully thrown him over once, and\nwas now anxious to throw him over again? \"I will not stay away,\" he\nsaid; and Dockwrath secured his lodgings for him. About this time\nhe was a good deal with Mr. Dockwrath, and almost regretted that he\nhad not followed that gentleman's advice at the commencement of the\ntrial, and placed the management of the whole concern in his hands.\n\nThus Alston was quite alive on the morning of the trial, and the\ndoors of the court-house were thronged long before they were opened.\nThey who were personally concerned in the matter, whose presence\nduring the ceremony would be necessary, or who had legal connection\nwith the matter in hand, were of course not driven to this tedious\nmanner of obtaining places. Mr. Dockwrath, for instance, did\nnot stand waiting at the door, nor did his friend Mr. Mason. Mr.\nDockwrath was a great man as far as this day was concerned, and could\ncommand admittance from the doorkeepers and others about the court.\nBut for the outer world, for men and women who were not lucky enough\nto be lawyers, witnesses, jurymen, or high sheriff, there was no\nmeans of hearing and seeing the events of this stirring day except\nwhat might be obtained by exercise of an almost unlimited patience.\n\nThere had been much doubt as to what arrangement for her attendance\nat the court it might be best for Lady Mason to make, and some\ndifficulty too as to who should decide as to these arrangements.\nMr. Aram had been down more than once, and had given a hint that it\nwould be well that something should be settled. It had ended in his\nsettling it himself,--he, with the assistance of Mrs. Orme. What\nwould Sir Peregrine have said had he known that on any subject these\ntwo had been leagued in council together?\n\n\"She can go from hence in a carriage--a carriage from the inn,\" Mrs.\nOrme had said.\n\n\"Certainly, certainly; a carriage from the inn; yes. But in the\nevening, ma'am?\"\n\n\"When the trial is over?\" said Mrs. Orme, inquiring from him his\nmeaning.\n\n\"We can hardly expect that it shall be over in one day, ma'am. She\nwill continue to be on bail, and can return home. I will see that she\nis not annoyed as she leaves the town.\"\n\n\"Annoyed?\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"By the people I mean.\"\n\n\"Will there be anything of that, sir?\" she asked, turning pale at the\nidea. \"I shall be with her, you know.\"\n\n\"Through the whole affair, ma'am?\"\n\n\"Yes, through the whole affair.\"\n\n\"They'll want to have a look at her of course; but,--Mrs. Orme, we'll\nsee that you are not annoyed. Yes; she had better come back home the\nfirst day. The expense won't be much; will it?\"\n\n\"Oh no,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"I must return home, you know. How many days\nwill it be, sir?\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps two,--perhaps three. It may run on all the week. Of\ncourse you know, Mrs. Orme--\"\n\n\"Know what?\" she asked.\n\n\"When the trial is over, if--if it should go against us,--then you\nmust return alone.\"\n\nAnd so the matter had been settled, and Mr. Aram himself had ordered\nthe carriage from the inn. Sir Peregrine's carriage would have been\nat their disposal,--or rather Mrs. Orme's own carriage; but she had\nfelt that The Cleeve arms on The Cleeve panels would be out of place\nin the streets of Hamworth on such an occasion. It would of course be\nimpossible that she should not be recognised in the court, but she\nwould do as little as possible to proclaim her own presence.\n\nWhen the morning came, the very morning of the terrible day, Mrs.\nOrme came down early from her room, as it was necessary that she\nshould breakfast two hours before the usual time. She had said\nnothing of this to Sir Peregrine, hoping that she might have been\nable to escape in the morning without seeing him. She had told her\nson to be there; but when she made her appearance in the breakfast\nparlour, she found that his grandfather was already with him. She sat\ndown and took her cup of tea almost in silence, for they all felt\nthat on such a morning much speech was impossible for them.\n\n\"Edith, my dear,\" said the baronet, \"you had better eat something.\nThink of the day that is before you.\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I have,\" said she, and she lifted a morsel of bread to\nher mouth.\n\n\"You must take something with you,\" said he, \"or you will be faint in\nthe court. Have you thought how many hours you will be there?\"\n\n\"I will see to that,\" said Peregrine, speaking with a stern decision\nin his voice that was by no means natural to him.\n\n\"Will you be there, Perry?\" said his mother.\n\n\"Of course I shall. I will see that you have what you want. You will\nfind that I will be near you.\"\n\n\"But how will you get in, my boy?\" asked his grandfather.\n\n\"Let me alone for that. I have spoken to the sheriff already. There\nis no knowing what may turn up; so if anything does turn up you may\nbe sure that I am near you.\"\n\nThen another slight attempt at eating was made, the cup of tea was\nemptied, and the breakfast was finished. \"Is the carriage there,\nPerry?\" asked Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Yes; it is at the door.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, father; I am so sorry to have disturbed you.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Edith; God bless you, and give you strength to bear it.\nAnd, Edith--\"\n\n\"Sir?\" and she held his hand as he whispered to her.\n\n\"Say to her a word of kindness from me;--a word of kindness. Tell her\nthat I have forgiven her, but tell her also that man's forgiveness\nwill avail her nothing.\"\n\n\"Yes, father, I will.\"\n\n\"Teach her where to look for pardon. But tell her all the same that I\nhave forgiven her.\"\n\nAnd then he handed her into the carriage. Peregrine, as he stood\naside, had watched them as they whispered, and to his mind also as he\nfollowed them to the carriage a suspicion of what the truth might be\nnow made its way. Surely there would be no need of all this solemn\nmourning if she were innocent. Had she been esteemed as innocent, Sir\nPeregrine was not the man to believe that any jury of his countrymen\ncould find her guilty. Had this been the reason for that sudden\nchange,--for that breaking off of the intended marriage? Even\nPeregrine, as he went down the steps after his mother, had begun to\nsuspect the truth; and we may say that he was the last within all\nthat household who did so. During the last week every servant at The\nCleeve had whispered to her fellow-servant that Lady Mason had forged\nthe will.\n\n\"I shall be near you, mother,\" said Peregrine as he put his hand into\nthe carriage; \"remember that. The judge and the other fellows will\ngo out in the middle of the day to get a glass of wine. I'll have\nsomething for both of you near the court.\"\n\nPoor Mrs. Orme as she pressed her son's hand felt much relieved by\nthe assurance. It was not that she feared anything, but she was going\nto a place that was absolutely new to her,--to a place in which the\neyes of many would be fixed on her,--to a place in which the eyes of\nall would be fixed on the companion with whom she would be joined.\nHer heart almost sank within her as the carriage drove away. She\nwould be alone till she reached Orley Farm, and there she would take\nup not only Lady Mason, but Mr. Aram also. How would it be with them\nin that small carriage while Mr. Aram was sitting opposite to them?\nMrs. Orme by no means regretted this act of kindness which she was\ndoing, but she began to feel that the task was not a light one. As\nto Mr. Aram's presence in the carriage, she need have been under no\nuneasiness. He understood very well when his presence was desirable,\nand also when it was not desirable.\n\nWhen she arrived at the door of Orley Farm house she found Mr. Aram\nwaiting there to receive her. \"I am sorry to say,\" said he, raising\nhis hat, \"that Lady Mason's son is to accompany us.\"\n\n\"She did not tell me,\" said Mrs. Orme, not understanding why this\nshould make him sorry.\n\n\"It was arranged between them last night, and it is very unfortunate.\nI cannot explain this to her; but perhaps--\"\n\n\"Why is it unfortunate, sir?\"\n\n\"Things will be said which--which--which would drive me mad if they\nwere said about my mother.\" And immediately there was a touch of\nsympathy between the high-bred lady and the Old Bailey Jew lawyer.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"It will be dreadful.\"\n\n\"And then if they find her guilty! It may be so, you know. And how is\nhe to sit there and hear the judge's charge;--and then the verdict,\nand the sentence. If he is there he cannot escape. I'll tell you\nwhat, Mrs. Orme; he should not be there at all.\"\n\nBut what could she do? Had it been possible that she should be an\nhour alone with Lady Mason, she would have explained all this to\nher,--or if not all, would have explained much of it. But now, with\nno minutes to spare, how could she make this understood? \"But all\nthat will not come to-day, will it, sir?\"\n\n\"Not all,--not the charge or the verdict. But he should not be there\neven to-day. He should have gone away; or if he remained at home, he\nshould not have shown himself out of the house.\"\n\nBut this was too late now, for as they were still speaking Lady Mason\nappeared at the door, leaning on her son's arm. She was dressed from\nhead to foot in black, and over her face there was a thick black\nveil. Mr. Aram spoke no word further as she stepped up the steps\nfrom the hall door to the carriage, but stood back, holding the\ncarriage-door open in his hand. Lucius merely bowed to Mrs. Orme as\nhe assisted his mother to take her place; and then following her,\nhe sat himself down in silence opposite to them. Mr. Aram, who had\ncarefully arranged his own programme, shut the door, and mounted on\nto the box beside the driver.\n\nMrs. Orme had held out her own hand, and Lady Mason having taken\nit, still held it after she was seated. Then they started, and for\nthe first mile no word was spoken between them. Mrs. Orme was most\nanxious to speak, if it might only be for the sake of breaking the\nhorrid stillness of their greeting; but she could think of no word\nwhich it would be proper on such an occasion to say, either to\nLucius, or even before him. Had she been alone with Lady Mason there\nwould have been enough of words that she could have spoken. Sir\nPeregrine's message was as a burden upon her tongue till she could\ndeliver it; but she could not deliver it while Lucius Mason was\nsitting by her.\n\nLady Mason herself was the first to speak. \"I did not know yesterday\nthat Lucius would come,\" she said, \"or I should have told you.\"\n\n\"I hope it does not inconvenience you,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh no; by no means.\"\n\n\"I could not let my mother go out without me on such an occasion as\nthis. But I am grateful to you, Mrs. Orme, for coming also.\"\n\n\"I thought it would be better for her to have some lady with her,\"\nsaid Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Oh yes, it is better--much better.\" And then no further word was\nspoken by any of them till the carriage drove up to the court-house\ndoor. It may be hoped that the journey was less painful to Mr. Aram\nthan to the others, seeing that he solaced himself on the coach-box\nwith a cigar.\n\nThere was still a great crowd round the front of the court-house when\nthey reached it, although the doors were open, and the court was\nalready sitting. It had been arranged that this case--the great case\nof the assize--should come on first on this day, most of the criminal\nbusiness having been completed on that preceding; and Mr. Aram\nhad promised that his charge should be forthcoming exactly at ten\no'clock. Exactly at ten the carriage was driven up to the door,\nand Mr. Aram jumping from his seat directed certain policemen and\nsheriff's servants to make a way for the ladies up to the door, and\nthrough the hall of the court-house. Had he lived in Alston all his\nlife, and spent his days in the purlieus of that court, he could not\nhave been more at home or have been more promptly obeyed.\n\n\"And now I think we may go in,\" he said, opening the door and letting\ndown the steps with his own hands.\n\nAt first he took them into a small room within the building, and\nthen bustled away himself into the court. \"I shall be back in half a\nminute,\" he said; and in half a dozen half-minutes he was back. \"We\nare all ready now, and shall have no trouble about our places. If you\nhave anything to leave,--shawls, or things of that sort,--they will\nbe quite safe here: Mrs. Hitcham will look after them.\" And then\nan old woman who had followed Mr. Aram into the room on the last\noccasion curtsied to them. But they had nothing to leave, and their\nlittle procession was soon made.\n\nLucius at first offered his arm to his mother, and she had taken it\ntill she had gone through the door into the hall. Mr. Aram also had,\nwith some hesitation, offered his arm to Mrs. Orme; but she, in spite\nof that touch of sympathy, had managed, without speaking, to decline\nit. In the hall, however, when all the crowd of gazers had turned\ntheir eyes upon them and was only kept off from pressing on them by\nthe policemen and sheriff's officers, Lady Mason remembered herself,\nand suddenly dropping her son's arm, she put out her hand for Mrs.\nOrme. Mr. Aram was now in front of them, and thus they two followed\nhim into the body of the court. The veils of both of them were down;\nbut Mrs. Orme's veil was not more than ordinarily thick, and she\ncould see everything that was around her. So they walked up through\nthe crowded way, and Lucius followed them by himself.\n\nThey were very soon in their seats, the crowd offering them no\nimpediment. The judge was already on the bench,--not our old\nacquaintance Justice Staveley, but his friend and colleague Baron\nMaltby. Judge Staveley was sitting in the other court. Mrs. Orme and\nLady Mason soon found themselves seated on a bench, with a slight\nstanding desk before them, much as though they were seated in\na narrow pew. Up above them, on the same seat, were the three\nbarristers employed on Lady Mason's behalf; nearest to the judge\nwas Mr. Furnival; then came Felix Graham, and below him sat Mr.\nChaffanbrass, somewhat out of the line of precedence, in order that\nhe might more easily avail himself of the services of Mr. Aram.\nLucius found himself placed next to Mr. Chaffanbrass, and his mother\nsat between him and Mrs. Orme. On the bench below them, immediately\nfacing a large table which was placed in the centre of the court, sat\nMr. Aram and his clerk.\n\n[Illustration: The Court.]\n\nMrs. Orme as she took her seat was so confused that she could hardly\nlook around her; and it may be imagined that Lady Mason must have\nsuffered at any rate as much in the same way. But they who were\nlooking at her--and it may be said that every one in the court was\nlooking at her--were surprised to see that she raised her veil as\nsoon as she was seated. She raised her veil, and never lowered it\nagain till she left the court, and repassed out into the hall. She\nhad thought much of this day,--even of the little incidents which\nwould occur,--and she was aware that her identification would be\nnecessary. Nobody should tell her to unveil herself, nor would she\nlet it be thought that she was afraid to face her enemies. So there\nshe sat during the whole day, bearing the gaze of the court.\n\nShe had dressed herself with great care. It may be said of most women\nwho could be found in such a situation, that they would either give\nno special heed to their dress on such a morning, or that they would\nappear in garments of sorrow studiously unbecoming and lachrymose, or\nthat they would attempt to outface the world, and have appeared there\nin bright trappings, fit for happier days. But Lady Mason had dressed\nherself after none of these fashions. Never had her clothes been\nbetter made, or worn with a better grace; but they were all black,\nfrom her bonnet-ribbon down to her boot, and were put on without\nany attempt at finery or smartness. As regards dress, she had never\nlooked better than she did now; and Mr. Furnival, when his eye caught\nher as she turned her head round towards the judge, was startled by\nthe grace of her appearance. Her face was very pale, and somewhat\nhard; but no one on looking at it could say that it was the\ncountenance of a woman overcome either by sorrow or by crime. She was\nperfect mistress of herself, and as she looked round the court, not\nwith defiant gaze, but with eyes half raised, and a look of modest\nbut yet conscious intelligence, those around her hardly dared to\nthink that she could be guilty.\n\nAs she thus looked her gaze fell on one face that she had not seen\nfor years, and their eyes met. It was the face of Joseph Mason of\nGroby, who sat opposite to her; and as she looked at him her own\ncountenance did not quail for a moment. Her own countenance did not\nquail; but his eyes fell gradually down, and when he raised them\nagain she had averted her face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV.\n\nFELIX GRAHAM RETURNS TO NONINGSBY.\n\n\n\"If you love the man, let him come.\" It was thus that the judge had\ndeclared to his daughter his opinion of what had better be done in\nthat matter of Felix Graham. Then he had gone on to declare that he\nhad given his permission to Felix Graham to say anything that he had\ngot to say, and finally had undertaken to invite Felix Graham to\nspend the assize week at Noningsby. Of course in the mind of the\njudge all this amounted to an actual giving away of his daughter.\nHe regarded the thing now as done, looking upon the young people as\nbetrothed, and his reflections mainly ran on the material part of\nthe business. How should Graham be made to earn an income, and what\nallowance must be made to him till he did so? There was a certain sum\nset apart for Madeline's fortune, but that would by no means suffice\nfor the livelihood of a married barrister in London. Graham no doubt\nearned something as it was, but that was done by his pen rather than\nby his wig, and the judge was inclined to think that the pen must\nbe abandoned before the wig could be made profitable. Such were the\ndirections which his thoughts took regarding Madeline's lot in life.\nWith him the next week or two, with their events, did not signify\nmuch; whereas the coming years did signify a great deal.\n\nAt that time, on that Sunday afternoon, there still remained to\nMadeline the best part of a month to think of it all, before Felix\nshould reappear upon the scene. But then she could not think of it\nby herself in silence. Her father had desired her to tell her mother\nwhat had passed, and she felt that a great difficulty still lay\nbefore her. She knew that her mother did not wish her to marry Felix\nGraham. She knew that her mother did wish her to marry Peregrine\nOrme. And therefore though no mother and child had ever treated each\nother with a sweeter confidence, or loved each other with warmer\nhearts, there was as it were a matter of disunion between them. But\nnevertheless she must tell her mother, and the dread of this telling\nweighed heavy upon her as she sat that night in the drawing-room\nreading the article which Felix had written.\n\nBut she need not have been under any alarm. Her father, when he told\nher to discuss the matter with her mother, had by no means intended\nto throw on her shoulders the burden of converting Lady Staveley to\nthe Graham interest. He took care to do this himself effectually, so\nthat in fact there should be no burden left for Madeline's shoulders.\n\"Well, my dear,\" he said that same Sunday evening to his wife, \"I\nhave had it all out with Madeline this afternoon.\"\n\n\"About Mr. Graham, do you mean?\"\n\n\"Yes; about Mr. Graham. I have promised that he shall come here for\nthe assize week.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\"\n\n\"It's done, my love; and I believe we shall find it all for the\nbest. The bishops' daughters always marry clergymen, and the judges'\ndaughters ought to marry lawyers.\"\n\n\"But you can't give him a practice. The bishops have livings to give\naway.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I may show him how to make a practice for himself, which\nwould be better. Take my word for it that it will be best for her\nhappiness. You would not have liked to be disappointed yourself, when\nyou made up your mind to be married.\"\n\n\"No, I should not,\" said Lady Staveley.\n\n\"And she will have a will of her own quite as strong as you had.\" And\nthen there was silence in the room for some time.\n\n\"You'll be kind to him when he comes?\" said the judge.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Lady Staveley, in a voice that was by no means devoid\nof melancholy.\n\n\"Nobody can be so kind as you when you please. And as it is to be--\"\n\n\"I always did like him,\" said Lady Staveley, \"although he is so very\nplain.\"\n\n\"You'll soon get used to that, my dear.\"\n\n\"And as for poor young Mr. Orme--\"\n\n\"As for poor young Mr. Orme, as you call him, he will not die of a\nbroken heart. Poor young Mr. Orme has all the world before him and\nwill soon console himself.\"\n\n\"But he is so attached to her. And then The Cleeve is so near.\"\n\n\"We must give up all that, my dear.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Lady Staveley; and from that moment it may be said\nthat she had given in her adhesion to the Graham connection. When\nsome time after she gave her orders to Baker as to preparing a room\nfor Mr. Graham, it was made quite clear to that excellent woman by\nher mistress's manner and anxiety as to the airing of the sheets,\nthat Miss Madeline was to have her own way in the matter.\n\nBut long previous to these preparations Madeline and her mother had\ndiscussed the matter fully. \"Papa says that Mr. Graham is to come\nhere for the assize week,\" said Lady Staveley.\n\n\"Yes; so he told me,\" Madeline replied, very bashfully.\n\n\"I suppose it's all for the best.\"\n\n\"I hope it is,\" said Madeline. What could she do but hope so?\n\n\"Your papa understands everything so very well that I am sure he\nwould not let him come if it were not proper.\"\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Madeline.\n\n\"And now I look upon the matter as all settled.\"\n\n\"What matter, mamma?\"\n\n\"That he--that he is to come here as your lover.\"\n\n\"Oh, no, mamma. Pray don't imagine that. It is not so at all. What\nshould I do if you were to say anything to make him think so?\"\n\n\"But you told me that you loved him.\"\n\n\"So I do, mamma.\"\n\n\"And he told your papa that he was desperately in love with you.\"\n\n\"I don't know, mamma.\"\n\n\"But he did;--your papa told me so, and that's why he asked him to\ncome down here again. He never would have done it without.\"\n\nMadeline had her own idea about this, believing that her father had\nthought more of her wants in the matter than he had of those of Felix\nGraham; but as to this she said nothing. \"Nevertheless, mamma, you\nmust not say that to any one,\" she answered. \"Mr. Graham has never\nspoken to me,--not a word. I should of course have told you had he\ndone so.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am sure of that. But, Madeline, I suppose it's all the same.\nHe asked papa for permission to speak to you, and your papa has given\nit.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know, mamma.\"\n\nIt was a quarter of an hour after that when Lady Staveley again\nreturned to the subject. \"I am sure Mr. Graham is very clever, and\nall that.\"\n\n\"Papa says that he is very clever indeed.\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure he is, and he makes himself very nice in the house,\nalways talking when there are people to dinner. Mr. Arbuthnot never\nwill talk when there are people to dinner. But Mr. Arbuthnot has got\na very nice place in Warwickshire, and they say he'll come in for the\ncounty some day.\"\n\n\"Of course, mamma, if there should be anything of that sort, we\nshould not be rich people, like Isabella and Mr. Arbuthnot.\"\n\n\"Not at first, dear.\"\n\n\"Neither first nor last. But I don't care about that. If you and papa\nwill like him, and--and--if it should come to that!--Oh, mamma, he is\nso good, and so clever, and he understands things, and talks about\nthings as though he knew how to make himself master of them. And he\nis honest and proud. Oh, mamma, if it should be so, I do hope you\nwill love him.\"\n\nAnd then Lady Staveley promised that she would love him, thinking\nnevertheless that had things gone differently she would have extended\na more motherly warmth of affection to Peregrine Orme.\n\nAnd about this time Peregrine Orme made another visit to Noningsby.\nHis intention was to see the judge, explaining what steps his\ngrandfather had taken as to The Cleeve property, and then once more\nto have thrown himself at Madeline's feet. But circumstances as they\nturned out prevented this. Although he had been at some trouble to\nascertain when the judge would be at Noningsby, nevertheless, on his\narrival, the judge was out. He would be home, the servant said,\nto dinner, but not before; and therefore he had again seen Lady\nStaveley, and after seeing her had not thrown himself at Madeline's\nfeet.\n\nHe had made up his mind to give a systematic and detailed account of\nhis pecuniary circumstances, and had selected nearly the very words\nin which this should be made, not actuated by any idea that such a\nprocess would have any weight with Madeline, or by any means assist\nhim with her, but hoping that he might thus procure the judge's\npermission to press his suit. But all this preparation and all his\nchosen words were of no use to him. When he saw Lady Staveley's face\nhe at once knew that she had no comfort to offer to him. \"Well,\" he\nsaid; \"is there any chance for me?\" He had intended to speak in a\nvery different tone, but words which have been prepared seldom manage\nto fit themselves into their appropriate places.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Orme,\" she said, taking him by the hand, and holding it. \"I\nwish it were different; I wish it could be different.\"\n\n\"There is no hope then?\" And as he spoke there was a sound in his\nvoice as though the tidings would utterly unman him.\n\n\"I should be wicked to deceive you,\" she said. \"There is no hope.\"\nAnd then as she looked up at the sorrow so plainly written in the\nlines of his young, handsome face, tears came into her eyes and\nrolled down her cheeks. How could it be that a daughter of hers\nshould be indifferent to the love of such a suitor as this?\n\nBut Peregrine, when he saw her sorrow, repressed his own. \"Very\nwell,\" said he; \"I will at any rate know how to take an answer. And\nfor your kindness to me in the matter I am much obliged. I ought to\nhave known myself better than to have supposed she could have cared\nfor me.\"\n\n\"I am sure she feels that you have done her great honour.\"\n\n\"Psha! honour! But never mind--Good-bye, Lady Staveley.\"\n\n\"Will you not see her?\"\n\n\"No. Why should I see her? Give her my love--my best love--\"\n\n\"I will--I will.\"\n\n\"And tell her that I hope she may be happy, and make some fellow\nhappy who is more fortunate than I am. I shall get out of the way\nsomewhere, so that I shall not make a fool of myself when I see it.\"\nAnd then he took his departure, and rode back again to The Cleeve.\nThis happened two days before the commencement of the trial, and the\nday before that on which Graham was to arrive at Noningsby.\n\nWhen Graham received the judge's note asking him to put up at\nNoningsby for the assize week, he was much astonished. It was very\nshort.\n\n\n   DEAR GRAHAM,\n\n   As you are coming down to Alston, special in Lady Mason's\n   case, you may as well come and stay here. Lady Staveley\n   bids me say that she will be delighted. Your elder\n   brethren will no doubt go back to London each night, so\n   that you will not be expected to remain with them.\n\n   Yours always, &c.\n\n\nWhat could be the intention of the judge in taking so strange a step\nas this? The judge had undertaken to see him in three months, having\ngiven him some faint idea that there then might be a chance of hope.\nBut now, before one month was over, he was actually sending for him\nto the house, and inviting him to stay there. What would all the bar\nworld say when they found that a young barrister was living at the\njudge's house during the assizes? Would it not be in every man's\nmouth that he was a suitor accepted both by the judge's daughter and\nby the judge? There would be nothing in that to go against the grain\nwith him, if only the fact were so. That the fact should be so he\ncould not venture to hope even on this hint; but he accepted the\njudge's invitation, sent his grateful thanks to Lady Staveley;--as\nto Lady Staveley's delight, he was sure that the judge must have\nromanced a little, for he had clearly recognised Lady Staveley as his\nenemy;--and then he prepared himself for the chances of war.\n\nOn the evening before the trial he arrived at Noningsby just in time\nfor dinner. He had been obliged to remain an hour or two at Alston in\nconference with Mr. Aram, and was later than he had expected he would\nbe. He had been afraid to come early in the day, lest by doing so he\nmight have seemed to overstep the margin of his invitation. When he\ndid arrive, the two ladies were already dressing, and he found the\njudge in the hall.\n\n\"A pretty fellow you are,\" said the judge. \"It's dinner-time already,\nand of course you take an hour to dress.\"\n\n\"Mr. Aram--\" began Felix.\n\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Aram! I'll give you fifteen minutes, but not a moment\nmore.\" And so Felix was hurried on up to his bedroom--the old bedroom\nin which he had passed so many hours, and been so very uneasy. As\nhe entered the room all that conversation with Augustus Staveley\nreturned upon his memory. He had seen his friend in London, and told\nhim that he was going down to Noningsby. Augustus had looked grave,\nbut had said nothing about Madeline. Augustus was not in his father's\nconfidence in this matter, and had nothing to do but to look grave.\nOn that very morning, moreover, some cause had been given to himself\nfor gravity of demeanour.\n\nAt the door of his room he met Mrs. Baker, and, hurried though he was\nby the judge's strict injunction, he could not but shake hands with\nhis old and very worthy friend.\n\n\"Quite strong again,\" said he, in answer to her tender inquiries.\n\n\"So you are, I do declare. I will say this, Mr. Graham, for\nwholesomeness of flesh you beat anything I ever come nigh. There's\na many would have been weeks and weeks before they could have been\nmoved.\"\n\n\"It was your good nursing, Mrs. Baker.\"\n\n\"Well, I think we did take care of you among us. Do you remember the\npheasant, Mr. Graham?\"\n\n\"Remember it! I should think so; and how I improved the occasion.\"\n\n\"Yes; you did improve fast enough. And the sea-kale, Mr. Graham.\nLaws! the row I had with John Gardener about that! And, Mr. Graham,\ndo you remember how a certain friend used to come and ask after you\nat the door? Dear, dear, dear! I nearly caught it about that.\"\n\nBut Graham in his present frame of mind could not well endure to\ndiscuss his remembrances on that subject with Mrs. Baker, so he\ngood-humouredly pushed her out of the room, saying that the judge\nwould be mad if he delayed.\n\n\"That's true, too, Mr. Graham. And it won't do for you to take up Mr.\nAugustus's tricks in the house yet; will it?\" And then she left the\nroom. \"What does she mean by 'yet'?\" Felix said to himself as he went\nthrough the ceremony of dressing with all the haste in his power.\n\nHe was in the drawing-room almost within the fifteen minutes, and\nthere he found none but the judge and his wife and daughter. He had\nat first expected to find Augustus there, but had been told by Mrs.\nBaker that he was to come down on the following morning. His first\ngreeting from Lady Staveley was something like that he had already\nreceived up stairs, only made in less exuberant language. He was\ncongratulated on his speedy recovery and made welcome by a kind\nsmile. Then he shook hands with Madeline, and as he did so he\nobserved that the judge was at the trouble to turn away, so that he\nshould not watch the greeting. This he did see, but into Madeline's\nface he hardly ventured to look. He touched her hand, however, and\nsaid a word; and she also murmured something about his injury. \"And\nnow we'll go to dinner,\" said the judge. \"Give your arm that is not\nbroken to Lady Staveley.\" And so the meeting was over. \"Augustus will\nbe in Alston to-morrow when the court is opened,\" said the judge.\n\"That is to say if he finds it possible to get up so soon; but to-day\nhe had some engagements in town.\" The truth however was that the\njudge had chosen to be alone with Felix after dinner.\n\nThe dinner was very pleasant, but the judge talked for the whole\nparty. Madeline hardly spoke at all, nor did Lady Staveley say much.\nFelix managed to put in a few words occasionally, as it always\nbecomes a good listener to do, but the brunt of the battle lay with\nthe host. One thing Felix observed painfully,--that not a word was\nspoken about Lady Mason or Orley Farm. When he had been last there\nthe judge had spoken of it openly before the whole party, expressing\nhis opinion that she was a woman much injured; but now neither did\nhe say anything nor did Lady Staveley. He would probably not have\nobserved this had not a feeling crept upon him during the last\nfortnight, that that thorough conviction which men had felt as to her\ninnocence was giving way. While the ladies were there, however, he\ndid not himself allude to the subject.\n\nWhen they had left the room and the door had been closed behind\nthem, the judge began the campaign--began it, and as far as he was\nconcerned, ended it in a very few minutes. \"Graham,\" said he, \"I am\nglad to see you.\"\n\n\"Thank you, judge,\" said he.\n\n\"Of course you know, and I know, what that amounts to now. My idea is\nthat you acted as an honest man when you were last here. You are not\na rich man--\"\n\n\"Anything but that.\"\n\n\"And therefore I do not think it would have been well had you\nendeavoured to gain my daughter's affections without speaking to\nme,--or to her mother.\" Judge Staveley always spoke of his wife\nas though she were an absolute part of himself. \"She and I have\ndiscussed the matter now,--and you are at liberty to address yourself\nto Madeline if you please.\"\n\n\"My dear judge--\"\n\n\"Of course you understand that I am not answering for her?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course not.\"\n\n\"That's your look out. You must fight your own battle there. What you\nare allowed to understand is this,--that her father and mother will\ngive their consent to an engagement, if she finds that she can bring\nherself to give hers. If you are minded to ask her, you may do so.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall ask her.\"\n\n\"She will have five thousand pounds on her marriage, settled upon\nherself and her children,--and as much more when I die, settled\nin the same way. Now fill your glass.\" And in his own easy way he\nturned the subject round and began to talk about the late congress at\nBirmingham.\n\nFelix felt that it was not open to him at the present moment to say\nanything further about Madeline; and though he was disappointed at\nthis,--for he would have wished to go on talking about her all the\nevening--perhaps it was better for him. The judge would have said\nnothing further to encourage him, and he would have gradually been\ntaught to think that his chance with Madeline was little, and then\nless. \"He must have been a fool,\" my readers will say, \"not to\nhave known that Madeline was now his own.\" Probably. But then\nmodest-minded young men are fools.\n\nAt last he contrived to bring the conversation round from the\nBirmingham congress to the affairs of his new client; and indeed he\ncontrived to do so in spite of the judge, who was not particularly\nanxious to speak on the subject. \"After all that we said and did at\nBirmingham, it is odd that I should so soon find myself joined with\nMr. Furnival.\"\n\n\"Not at all odd. Of course you must take up your profession as others\nhave taken it up before you. Very many young men dream of a Themis\nfit for Utopia. You have slept somewhat longer than others, and your\ndreams have been more vivid.\"\n\n\"And now I wake to find myself leagued with the Empson and Dudley of\nour latter-day law courts.\"\n\n\"Fie, Graham, fie. Do not allow yourself to speak in that tone of men\nwhom you know to be zealous advocates, and whom you do not know to be\ndishonest opponents.\"\n\n\"It is they and such as they that make so many in these days feel the\nneed of some Utopia,--as it was in the old days of our history. But I\nbeg your pardon for nicknaming them, and certainly ought not to have\ndone so in your presence.\"\n\n\"Well; if you repent yourself, and will be more charitable for the\nfuture, I will not tell of you.\"\n\n\"I have never yet even seen Mr. Chaffanbrass in court,\" said Felix,\nafter a pause.\n\n\"The more shame for you, never to have gone to the court in which he\npractises. A barrister intending to succeed at the common law bar\ncannot have too wide an experience in such matters.\"\n\n\"But then I fear that I am a barrister not intending to succeed.\"\n\n\"I am very sorry to hear it,\" said the judge. And then again the\nconversation flagged for a minute or two.\n\n\"Have you ever seen him at a country assize town before, judge?\"\nasked Felix.\n\n\"Whom? Chaffanbrass? I do not remember that I have.\"\n\n\"His coming down in this way is quite unusual, I take it.\"\n\n\"Rather so, I should say. The Old Bailey is his own ground.\"\n\n\"And why should they think it necessary in such a case as this to\nhave recourse to such a proceeding?\"\n\n\"It would be for me to ask you that, seeing that you are one of the\ncounsel.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say, judge, that between you and me you are unwilling\nto give an opinion on such a subject?\"\n\n\"Well; you press me hard, and I think I may fairly say that I am\nunwilling. I would sooner discuss the matter with you after the\nverdict than before it. Come; we will go into the drawing-room.\"\n\nThere was not much in this. Indeed if it were properly looked at\nthere was nothing in it. But nevertheless Graham, as he preceded the\njudge out of the dining-room, felt that his heart misgave him about\nLady Mason. When first the matter had been spoken of at Noningsby,\nJudge Staveley had been fully convinced of Lady Mason's innocence,\nand had felt no reserve in expressing his opinion. He had expressed\nsuch an opinion very openly. Why should he now affect so much\nreticence, seeing that the question had been raised in the presence\nof them two alone? It was he who had persuaded Graham to undertake\nthis work, and now he went back from what he had done, and refused\neven to speak upon the subject. \"It must be that he thinks she is\nguilty,\" said Graham to himself, as he lay down that night in bed.\n\nBut there had been something more for him to do before bedtime came.\nHe followed the judge into the drawing-room, and in five minutes\nperceived that his host had taken up a book with the honest intention\nof reading it. Some reference was made to him by his wife, but he\nshowed at once that he did not regard Graham as company, and that he\nconceived himself to be entitled to enjoy the full luxury of home.\n\"Upon my word I don't know,\" he answered, without taking his eye off\nthe page. And then nobody spoke to him another word.\n\nAfter another short interval Lady Staveley went to sleep. When Felix\nGraham had before been at Noningsby, she would have rebelled against\nnature with all her force rather than have slept while he was left to\nwhisper what he would to her darling. But now he was authorised to\nwhisper, and why should not Lady Staveley sleep if she wished it? She\ndid sleep, and Felix was left alone with his love.\n\n[Illustration: The Drawing-Room at Noningsby.]\n\nAnd yet he was not altogether alone. He could not say to her those\nwords which he was now bound to say; which he longed to say in order\nthat he might know whether the next stage of his life was to be light\nor dark. There sat the judge, closely intent no doubt upon his book,\nbut wide awake. There also sat Lady Staveley, fast asleep certainly;\nbut with a wondrous power of hearing even in her sleep. And yet how\nwas he to talk to his love unless he talked of love? He wished that\nthe judge would help them to converse; he wished that some one else\nwas there; he wished at last that he himself was away. Madeline sat\nperfectly tranquil stitching a collar. Upon her there was incumbent\nno duty of doing anything beyond that. But he was in a measure bound\nto talk. Had he dared to do so he also would have taken up a book;\nbut that he knew to be impossible.\n\n\"Your brother will be down to-morrow,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Yes; he is to go direct to Alston. He will be here in the\nevening,--to dinner.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; I suppose we shall all be late to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Papa always is late when the assizes are going on,\" said Madeline.\n\n\"Alston is not very far,\" said Felix.\n\n\"Only two miles,\" she answered.\n\nAnd during the whole of that long evening the conversation between\nthem did not reach a more interesting pitch than that.\n\n\"She must think me an utter fool,\" said Felix to himself, as he sat\nstaring at the fire. \"How well her brother would have made the most\nof such an opportunity!\" And then he went to bed, by no means in a\ngood humour with himself.\n\nOn the next morning he again met her at breakfast, but on that\noccasion there was no possible opportunity for private conversation.\nThe judge was all alive, and talked enough for the whole party during\nthe twenty minutes that was allowed to them before they started\nfor Alston. \"And now we must be off. We'll say half-past seven for\ndinner, my dear.\" And then they also made their journey to Alston.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI.\n\nSHOWING HOW MISS FURNIVAL TREATED HER LOVERS.\n\n\nIt is a great thing for young ladies to live in a household in which\nfree correspondence by letter is permitted. \"Two for mamma, four for\nAmelia, three for Fanny, and one for papa.\" When the postman has left\nhis budget they should be dealt out in that way, and no more should\nbe said about it,--except what each may choose to say. Papa's letter\nis about money of course, and interests nobody. Mamma's contain the\ncharacter of a cook and an invitation to dinner, and as they interest\neverybody, are public property. But Fanny's letters and Amelia's\nshould be private; and a well-bred mamma of the present day scorns\neven to look at the handwriting of the addresses. Now in Harley\nStreet things were so managed that nobody did see the handwriting\nof the addresses of Sophia's letters till they came into her own\nhand,--that is, neither her father nor her mother did so. That both\nSpooner and Mrs. Ball examined them closely is probable enough.\n\nThis was well for her now, for she did not wish it to be known as yet\nthat she had accepted an offer from Lucius Mason, and she did wish\nto have the privilege of receiving his letters. She fancied that she\nloved him. She told herself over and over again that she did so. She\ncompared him within her own mind to Augustus Staveley, and always\ngave the preference to Lucius. She liked Augustus also, and could\nhave accepted him as well, had it been the way of the world in\nEngland for ladies to have two accepted lovers. Such is not the\nway of the world in England, and she therefore had been under the\nnecessity of choosing one. She had taken the better of the two, she\ndeclared to herself very often; but nevertheless was it absolutely\nnecessary that the other should be abandoned altogether? Would it not\nbe well at any rate to wait till this trial should be over? But then\nthe young men themselves were in such a hurry!\n\nLucius, like an honest man, had proposed to go at once to Mr.\nFurnival when he was accepted; but to this Sophia had objected, \"The\npeculiar position in which my father stands to your mother at the\npresent moment,\" said she, \"would make it very difficult for him\nto give you an answer now.\" Lucius did not quite understand the\nreasoning, but he yielded. It did not occur to him for a moment that\neither Mr. or Miss Furnival could doubt the validity of his title to\nthe Orley Farm property.\n\nBut there was no reason why he should not write to her. \"Shall I\naddress here?\" he had asked. \"Oh yes,\" said Sophia; \"my letters are\nquite private.\" And he had written very frequently, and she had\nanswered him. His last letter before the trial I propose to publish,\ntogether with Sophia's answer, giving it as my opinion that the\ngentleman's production affords by no means a good type of a lover's\nletter. But then his circumstances were peculiar. Miss Furnival's\nanswer was, I think, much better.\n\n\n   Orley Farm, ---- ---- ----.\n\n   MY OWN SOPHIA,\n\n   My only comfort--I may really say my only comfort now--is\n   in writing to you. It is odd that at my age, and having\n   begun the world early as I did, I should now find myself\n   so much alone. Were it not for you, I should have no\n   friend. I cannot describe to you the sadness of this\n   house, nor the wretched state in which my mother exists. I\n   sometimes think that had she been really guilty of those\n   monstrous crimes which people lay to her charge, she could\n   hardly have been more miserable. I do not understand it;\n   nor can I understand why your father has surrounded her\n   with lawyers whom he would not himself trust in a case of\n   any moment. To me she never speaks on the subject, which\n   makes the matter worse--worse for both of us. I see her\n   at breakfast and at dinner, and sometimes sit with her\n   for an hour in the evening; but even then we have no\n   conversation. The end of it is I trust soon coming, and\n   then I hope that the sun will again be bright. In these\n   days it seems as though there were a cloud over the whole\n   earth.\n\n   I wish with all my heart that you could have been here\n   with her. I think that your tone and strength of mind\n   would have enabled her to bear up against these troubles\n   with more fortitude. After all, it is but the shadow of\n   a misfortune which has come across her, if she would but\n   allow herself so to think. As it is, Mrs. Orme is with\n   her daily, and nothing I am sure can be more kind. But I\n   can confess to you, though I could do so to no one else,\n   that I do not willingly see an intimacy kept up between\n   my mother and The Cleeve. Why was there that strange\n   proposition as to her marriage; and why, when it was once\n   made, was it abandoned? I know that my mother has been\n   not only guiltless, but guileless, in these matters as to\n   which she is accused; but nevertheless her affairs will\n   have been so managed that it will be almost impossible for\n   her to remain in this neighbourhood.\n\n   When all this is over, I think I shall sell this place.\n   What is there to bind me,--to bind me or you to Orley\n   Farm? Sometimes I have thought that I could be happy here,\n   devoting myself to agriculture,--\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" Sophia exclaimed, as she read this,\n\n   --and doing something to lessen the dense ignorance of\n   those around me; but for such work as that a man should\n   be able to extend himself over a larger surface than that\n   which I can influence. My dream of happiness now carries\n   me away from this to other countries,--to the sunny\n   south. Could you be happy there? A friend of mine whom I\n   well knew in Germany, has a villa on the Lake of Como,--\n\n\"Indeed, sir, I'll do no such thing,\" said Sophia to herself,\n\n   --and there I think we might forget all this annoyance.\n\n   I shall not write again now till the trial is over. I have\n   made up my mind that I will be in court during the whole\n   proceedings. If my mother will admit it, I will remain\n   there close to her, as her son should do in such an\n   emergency. If she will not have this, still I will be\n   there. No one shall say that I am afraid to see my mother\n   in any position to which fortune can bring her, or that I\n   have ever doubted her innocence.\n\n   God bless you, my own one.\n\n   Yours,\n\n   L. M.\n\n\nTaking this letter as a whole perhaps we may say that there was not\nas much nonsense in it as young gentlemen generally put into their\nlove-letters to young ladies; but I am inclined to think that it\nwould have been a better love-letter had there been more nonsense. At\nany rate there should have been less about himself, and more about\nthe lady. He should have omitted the agriculture altogether, and been\nmore sure of his loved one's tastes before he suggested the sunny\nsouth and the Como villa. It is true that he was circumstanced as few\nlovers are, with reference to his mother; but still I think he might\nhave been less lachrymose. Sophia's answer, which was sent after the\nlapse of a day or two, was as follows:--\n\n\n   Harley Street, ---- ---- ----.\n\n   MY DEAR LUCIUS,\n\n   I am not surprised that you should feel somewhat\n   low-spirited at the present moment; but you will find,\n   I have no doubt, that the results of the next week will\n   cure all that. Your mother will be herself again when this\n   trial is over, and you will then wonder that it should\n   ever have had so depressing an influence either upon you\n   or upon her. I cannot but suppose that papa has done the\n   best as to her advisers. I know how anxious he is about\n   it, and they say that he is very clever in such matters.\n   Pray give your mother my love. I cannot but think she\n   is lucky to have Mrs. Orme with her. What can be more\n   respectable than a connection at such a time with such\n   people?\n\n   As to your future residence, do not make up your mind\n   to anything while your spirits are thus depressed. If\n   you like to leave Orley Farm, why not let it instead of\n   selling it? As for me, if it should be fated that our lots\n   are to go together, I am inclined to think that I should\n   prefer to live in England. In London papa's position might\n   probably be of some service, and I should like no life\n   that was not active. But it is too early in the day to\n   talk thus at present. You must not think me cold hearted\n   if I say that what has as yet been between us must not be\n   regarded as an absolute and positive engagement. I, on my\n   part, hope that it may become so. My heart is not cold,\n   and I am not ashamed to own that I esteem you favourably;\n   but marriage is a very serious thing, and there is so much\n   to be considered! I regard myself as a free agent, and in\n   a great measure independent of my parents on such a matter\n   as that; but still I think it well to make no positive\n   promise without consulting them. When this trial is over\n   I will speak to my father, and then you will come up to\n   London and see us.\n\n   Mind you give my love to your mother; and--if it have any\n   value in your eyes--accept it yourself.\n\n   Your affectionate friend,\n\n   SOPHIA FURNIVAL.\n\n\nI feel very confident that Mrs. Furnival was right in declining\nto inquire very closely into the circumstances of her daughter's\ncorrespondence. A young lady who could write such a letter to her\nlover as that requires but little looking after; and in those points\nas to which she may require it, will--if she be so minded--elude it.\nSuch as Miss Furnival was, no care on her mother's part would, I\nthink, have made her better. Much care might have made her worse, as,\nhad she been driven to such resources, she would have received her\nletters under a false name at the baker's shop round the corner.\n\nBut the last letter was not written throughout without interruption.\nShe was just declaring how on her part she hoped that her present\nuncertain tenure of her lover's hand might at some future time become\ncertain, when Augustus Staveley was announced. Sophia, who was\nalone in the drawing-room, rose from her table, gracefully, slipped\nher note under the cover of the desk, and courteously greeted her\nvisitor. \"And how are they all at dear Noningsby?\" she asked.\n\n[Illustration: \"And how are they all at Noningsby?\"]\n\n\"Dear Noningsby is nearly deserted. There is no one there but my\nmother and Madeline.\"\n\n\"And who more would be wanting to make it still dear,--unless it be\nthe judge? I declare, Mr. Staveley, I was quite in love with your\nfather when I left. Talk of honey falling from people's mouths!--he\ndrops nothing less than champagne and pineapples.\"\n\n\"How very difficult of digestion his conversation must be!\"\n\n\"By no means. If the wine be good and the fruit ripe, nothing can be\nmore wholesome. And is everybody else gone? Let me see;--Mr. Graham\nwas still there when I left.\"\n\n\"He came away shortly afterwards,--as soon, that is, as his arm would\nallow him.\"\n\n\"What a happy accident that was for him, Mr. Staveley!\"\n\n\"Happy!--breaking three of his ribs, his arm, and his collar-bone! I\nthought it very unhappy.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's because your character is so deficient in true chivalry.\nI call it a very happy accident which gives a gentleman an\nopportunity of spending six weeks under the same roof with the lady\nof his love. Mr. Graham is a man of spirit, and I am by no means sure\nthat he did not break his bones on purpose.\"\n\nAugustus for a moment thought of denying the imputation with regard\nto his sister, but before he had spoken he had changed his mind. He\nwas already aware that his friend had been again invited down to\nNoningsby, and if his father chose to encourage Graham, why should\nhe make difficulties? He had conceived some general idea that Felix\nGraham was not a guest to be welcomed into a rich man's family as a\nson-in-law. He was poor and crotchety, and as regards professional\nmatters unsteady. But all that was a matter for his father to\nconsider, not for him. So he held his peace as touching Graham, and\ncontrived to change the subject, veering round towards that point of\nthe compass which had brought him into Harley Street.\n\n\"Perhaps then, Miss Furnival, it might answer some purpose if I were\nto get myself run over outside there. I could get one of Pickford's\nvans, or a dray from Barclay and Perkins', if that might be thought\nserviceable.\"\n\n\"It would be of no use in the world, Mr. Staveley. Those very\ncharitable middle-aged ladies opposite, the Miss Mac Codies, would\nhave you into their house in no time, and when you woke from your\nfirst swoon, you would find yourself in their best bedroom, with one\non each side of you.\"\n\n\"And you in the mean time--\"\n\n\"I should send over every morning at ten o'clock to inquire after\nyou--in mamma's name. 'Mrs. Furnival's compliments, and hopes Mr.\nStaveley will recover the use of his legs.' And the man would bring\nback word: 'The doctor hopes he may, miss; but his left eye is gone\nfor ever.' It is not everybody that can tumble discreetly. Now you, I\nfancy, would only disfigure yourself.\"\n\n\"Then I must try what fortune can do for me without the brewer's\ndray.\"\n\n\"Fortune has done quite enough for you, Mr. Staveley; I do not advise\nyou to tempt her any further.\"\n\n\"Miss Furnival, I have come to Harley Street to-day on purpose to\ntempt her to the utmost. There is my hand--\"\n\n\"Mr. Staveley, pray keep your hand for a while longer in your own\npossession.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly I shall do so, unless I dispose of it this morning. When\nwe were at Noningsby together, I ventured to tell you what I felt for\nyou--\"\n\n\"Did you, Mr. Staveley? If your feelings were anything beyond the\ncommon, I don't remember the telling.\"\n\n\"And then,\" he continued, without choosing to notice her words, \"you\naffected to believe that I was not in earnest in what I said to you.\"\n\n\"And you must excuse me if I affect to believe the same thing of you\nstill.\"\n\nAugustus Staveley had come into Harley Street with a positive resolve\nto throw his heart and hand and fortune at the feet of Miss Furnival.\nI fear that I shall not raise him in the estimation of my readers by\nsaying so. But then my readers will judge him unfairly. They will\nforget that they have had a much better opportunity of looking into\nthe character of Miss Furnival than he had had; and they will also\nforget that they have had no such opportunity of being influenced by\nher personal charms. I think I remarked before that Miss Furnival\nwell understood how best to fight her own battle. Had she shown\nherself from the first anxious to regard as a definite offer the\nfirst words tending that way which Augustus had spoken to her,\nhe would at once have become indifferent about the matter. As a\nconsequence of her judicious conduct he was not indifferent. We\nalways want that which we can't get easily. Sophia had made herself\ndifficult to be gotten, and therefore Augustus fancied that he wanted\nher. Since he had been in town he had been frequently in Harley\nStreet, and had been arguing with himself on the matter. What match\ncould be more discreet or better? Not only was she very handsome, but\nshe was clever also. And not only was she handsome and clever, but\nmoreover she was an heiress. What more could his friends want for\nhim, and what more could he want for himself? His mother did in truth\nregard her as a nasty, sly girl; but then his mother did not know\nSophia, and in such matters mothers are so ignorant!\n\nMiss Furnival, on his thus repeating his offer, again chose to affect\na belief that he was not in earnest. I am inclined to think that she\nrather liked this kind of thing. There is an excitement in the game;\nand it is one which may be played without great danger to either\nparty if it be played cautiously and with some skill. As regards\nAugustus at the present moment, I have to say--with some regret--that\nhe abandoned all idea of caution, and that he showed very little\nskill.\n\n\"Then,\" said he, \"I must beg you to lay aside an affectation which is\nso very injurious both to my honour and to my hopes of happiness.\"\n\n\"Your honour, Mr. Staveley, is quite safe, I am certain.\"\n\n\"I wish that my happiness were equally so,\" said he. \"But at any rate\nyou will let me have an answer. Sophia--\"\n\nAnd now he stood up, looking at her with something really like love\nin his eyes, and Miss Furnival began to understand that if she so\nchose it the prize was really within her reach. But then was it a\nprize? Was not the other thing the better prize? The other thing was\nthe better prize;--if only that affair about the Orley Farm were\nsettled. Augustus Staveley was a good-looking handsome fellow, but\nthen there was that in the manner and gait of Lucius Mason which\nbetter suited her taste. There are ladies who prefer Worcester ware\nto real china; and, moreover, the order for the Worcester ware had\nalready been given.\n\n\"Sophia, let a man be ever so light-hearted, there will come to him\nmoments of absolute and almost terrible earnestness.\"\n\n\"Even to you, Mr. Staveley.\"\n\n\"I have at any rate done nothing to deserve your scorn.\"\n\n\"Fie, now; you to talk of my scorn! You come here with soft words\nwhich run easily from your tongue, feeling sure that I shall be proud\nin heart when I hear them whispered into my ears; and now you pretend\nto be angry because I do not show you that I am elated. Do you think\nit probable that I should treat with scorn anything of this sort that\nyou might say to me seriously?\"\n\n\"I think you are doing so.\"\n\n\"Have you generally found yourself treated with scorn when you have\nbeen out on this pursuit?\"\n\n\"By heavens! you have no right to speak to me so. In what way shall I\nput my words to make them sound seriously to you? Do you want me to\nkneel at your feet, as our grandfathers used to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, certainly not. Our grandmothers were very stupid in desiring\nthat.\"\n\n\"If I put my hand on my heart will you believe me better?\"\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Then through what formula shall I go?\"\n\n\"Go through no formula, Mr. Staveley. In such affairs as these very\nlittle, as I take it, depends on the words that are uttered. When\nheart has spoken to heart, or even head to head, very little other\nspeaking is absolutely necessary.\"\n\n\"And my heart has not spoken to yours?\"\n\n\"Well;--no;--not with that downright plain open language which a\nheart in earnest always knows how to use. I suppose you think you\nlike me?\"\n\n\"Sophia, I love you well enough to make you my wife to-morrow.\"\n\n\"Yes; and to be tired of your bargain on the next day. Has it ever\noccurred to you that giving and taking in marriage is a very serious\nthing?\"\n\n\"A very serious thing; but I do not think that on that account it\nshould be avoided.\"\n\n\"No; but it seems to me that you are always inclined to play at\nmarriage. Do not be angry with me, but for the life of me I can never\nthink you are in earnest.\"\n\n\"But I shall be angry--very angry--if I do not get from you some\nanswer to what I have ventured to say.\"\n\n\"What, now; to-day;--this morning? If you insist upon that, the\nanswer can only be of one sort. If I am driven to decide this morning\non the question that you have asked me, great as the honour is--and\ncoming from you, Mr. Staveley, it is very great--I must decline it. I\nam not able, at any rate at the present moment, to trust my happiness\naltogether in your hands.\" When we think of the half-written letter\nwhich at this moment Miss Furnival had within her desk, this was not\nwonderful.\n\nAnd then, without having said anything more that was of note,\nAugustus Staveley went his way. As he walked up Harley Street, he\nhardly knew whether or no he was to consider himself as bound to Miss\nFurnival; nor did he feel quite sure whether or no he wished to be so\nbound. She was handsome, and clever, and an heiress; but yet he was\nnot certain that she possessed all those womanly charms which are\ndesirable in a wife. He could not but reflect that she had never yet\nsaid a soft word to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII.\n\nMR. MOULDER BACKS HIS OPINION.\n\n\nAs the day of the trial drew nigh, the perturbation of poor John\nKenneby's mind became very great. Moulder had not intended to\nfrighten him, but had thought it well to put him up to what he\nbelieved to be the truth. No doubt he would be badgered and bullied.\n\"And,\" as Moulder said to his wife afterwards, \"wasn't it better that\nhe should know what was in store for him?\" The consequence was, that\nhad it been by any means possible, Kenneby would have run away on the\nday before the trial.\n\nBut it was by no means possible, for Dockwrath had hardly left him\nalone for an instant. Dockwrath at this time had crept into a sort of\nemployment in the case from which Matthew Round had striven in vain\nto exclude him. Mr. Round had declared once or twice that if Mr.\nMason encouraged Dockwrath in interfering, he, Round, would throw\nthe matter up. But professional men cannot very well throw up their\nbusiness, and Round went on, although Dockwrath did interfere, and\nalthough Mr. Mason did encourage him. On the eve of the trial he went\ndown to Alston with Kenneby and Bolster; and Mr. Moulder, at the\nexpress instance of Kenneby, accompanied them.\n\n\"What can I do? I can't stop the fellow's gab,\" Moulder had said. But\nKenneby pleaded hard that some friend might be near him in the day of\nhis trouble, and Moulder at last consented.\n\n\"I wish it was me,\" Mrs. Smiley had said, when they talked the matter\nover in Great St. Helens; \"I'd let the barrister know what was what\nwhen he came to knock me about.\" Kenneby wished it also, with all his\nheart.\n\nMr. Mason went down by the same train, but he travelled by the first\nclass. Dockwrath, who was now holding his head up, would have gone\nwith him, had he not thought it better to remain with Kenneby. \"He\nmight jump out of the carriage and destroy himself,\" he said to Mr.\nMason.\n\n\"If he had any of the feelings of an Englishman within his breast,\"\nsaid Mason, \"he would be anxious to give assistance towards the\npunishment of such a criminal as that.\"\n\n\"He has only the feelings of a tomtit,\" said Dockwrath.\n\nLodgings had been taken for the two chief witnesses together, and\nMoulder and Dockwrath shared the accommodation with them. As they sat\ndown to tea together, these two gentlemen doubtless felt that Bridget\nBolster was not exactly fitting company for them. But the necessities\nof an assize week, and of such a trial as this, level much of these\ndistinctions, and they were both prepared to condescend and become\naffable.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. Bolster, and how do you find yourself?\" asked Dockwrath.\n\nBridget was a solid, square-looking woman, somewhat given to flesh,\nand now not very quick in her movements. But the nature of her past\nlife had given to her a certain amount of readiness, and an absence\nof that dread of her fellow-creatures, which so terribly afflicted\npoor Kenneby. And then also she was naturally not a stupid woman, or\none inclined to be muddle-headed. Perhaps it would be too much to say\nthat she was generally intelligent, but what she did understand, she\nunderstood thoroughly.\n\n\"Pretty well, I thank you, Mr. Dockwrath. I sha'n't be sorry to have\na bit of something to my tea.\"\n\nBridget Bolster perfectly understood that she was to be well fed\nwhen thus brought out for work in her country's service. To have\neverything that she wanted to eat and drink at places of public\nentertainment, and then to have the bills paid for her behind her\nback, was to Bridget Bolster the summit of transitory human bliss.\n\n\"And you shall have something to your tea,\" said Dockwrath. \"What's\nit to be?\"\n\n\"A steak's as good as anything at these places,\" suggested Moulder.\n\n\"Or some ham and eggs,\" suggested Dockwrath.\n\n\"Kidneys is nice,\" said Bridget.\n\n\"What do you say, Kenneby?\" asked Dockwrath.\n\n\"It is nothing to me,\" said Kenneby; \"I have no appetite. I think\nI'll take a little brandy-and-water.\"\n\nMr. Moulder possessed the most commanding spirit, and the steak was\nordered. They then made themselves as comfortable as circumstances\nwould admit, and gradually fell into a general conversation about\nthe trial. It had been understood among them since they first came\ntogether, that as a matter of etiquette the witnesses were not to\nbe asked what they had to say. Kenneby was not to divulge his facts\nin plain language, nor Bridget Bolster those which belonged to her;\nbut it was open to them all to take a general view of the matter,\nand natural that at the present moment they should hardly be able\nto speak of anything else. And there was a very divided opinion on\nthe subject in dispute; Dockwrath, of course, expressing a strong\nconviction in favour of a verdict of guilty, and Moulder being as\ncertain of an acquittal. At first Moulder had been very unwilling\nto associate with Dockwrath; for he was a man who maintained his\nanimosities long within his breast; but Dockwrath on this occasion\nwas a great man, and there was some slight reflection of greatness\non the associates of Dockwrath; it was only by the assistance of\nDockwrath that a place could be obtained within the court, and, upon\nthe whole, it became evident to Moulder that during such a crisis as\nthis the society of Dockwrath must be endured.\n\n\"They can't do anything to one if one do one's best?\" said Kenneby,\nwho was sitting apart from the table while the others were eating.\n\n\"Of course they can't,\" said Dockwrath, who wished to inspirit the\nwitnesses on his own side.\n\n\"It ain't what they do, but what they say,\" said Moulder; \"and then\neverybody is looking at you. I remember a case when I was young on\nthe road; it was at Nottingham. There had been some sugars delivered,\nand the rats had got at it. I'm blessed if they didn't ask me\nbackwards and forwards so often that I forgot whether they was\nseconds or thirds, though I'd sold the goods myself. And then the\nlawyer said he'd have me prosecuted for perjury. Well, I was that\nfrightened, I could not stand in the box. I ain't so green now by a\ngood deal.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you're not, Mr. Moulder,\" said Bridget, who well understood\nthe class to which Moulder belonged.\n\n\"After that I met that lawyer in the street, and was ashamed to look\nhim in the face. I'm blessed if he didn't come up and shake hands\nwith me, and tell me that he knew all along that his client hadn't a\nleg to stand on. Now I call that beautiful.\"\n\n\"Beautiful!\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"Yes, I do. He fought that battle just as if he was sure of winning,\nthough he knew he was going to lose. Give me the man that can fight a\nlosing battle. Anybody can play whist with four by honours in his own\nhands.\"\n\n\"I don't object to four by honours either,\" said Dockwrath; \"and\nthat's the game we are going to play to-morrow.\"\n\n\"And lose the rubber after all,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"No, I'm blessed if we do, Mr. Moulder. If I know anything of my own\nprofession--\"\n\n\"Humph!\" ejaculated Moulder.\n\n\"And I shouldn't be here in such a case as this if I didn't;--but if\nI do, Lady Mason has no more chance of escape than--than--than that\nbit of muffin has.\" And as he spoke the savoury morsel in question\ndisappeared from the fingers of the commercial traveller.\n\nFor a moment or two Moulder could not answer him. The portion of food\nin question was the last on his plate; it had been considerable in\nsize, and required attention in mastication. Then the remaining gravy\nhad to be picked up on the blade of the knife, and the particles of\npickles collected and disposed of by the same process. But when all\nthis had been well done, Moulder replied--\n\n\"That may be your opinion, Mr. Dockwrath, and I dare say you may know\nwhat you're about.\"\n\n\"Well; I rather think I do, Mr. Moulder.\"\n\n\"Mine's different. Now when one gentleman thinks one thing and\nanother thinks another, there's nothing for it in my mind but for\neach gentleman to back his own. That's about the ticket in this\ncountry, I believe.\"\n\n\"That's just as a gentleman may feel disposed,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"No it ain't. What's the use of a man having an opinion if he won't\nback it? He's bound to back it, or else he should give way, and\nconfess he ain't so sure about it as he said he was. There's no\ncoming to an end if you don't do that. Now there's a ten-pound note,\"\nand Moulder produced that amount of the root of all evil; \"I'll put\nthat in John Kenneby's hands, and do you cover it.\" And then he\nlooked as though there were no possible escape from the proposition\nwhich he had made.\n\n\"I decline to have anything to do with it,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"Gammon,\" said Moulder; \"two ten-pound notes won't burn a hole in\nyour pocket.\"\n\n\"Suppose I should be asked a question about it to-morrow; where\nshould I be then?\"\n\n\"Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Kenneby,\" said Dockwrath; \"I'm not going\nto bet.\"\n\n\"You ain't, ain't you?\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Certainly not, Mr. Moulder. If you understood professional matters\na little better, you'd know that a professional gentleman couldn't\nmake a bet as to a case partly in his own hands without very great\nimpropriety.\" And Dockwrath gathered himself up, endeavouring to\nimpress a sense of his importance on the two witnesses, even should\nhe fail of doing so upon Mr. Moulder.\n\nMoulder repocketed his ten-pound note, and laughed with a long, low\nchuckle. According to his idea of things, he had altogether got the\nbetter of the attorney upon that subject. As he himself put it so\nplainly, what criterion is there by which a man can test the validity\nof his own opinion if he be not willing to support it by a bet? A man\nis bound to do so, or else to give way and apologise. For many years\nhe had insisted upon this in commercial rooms as a fundamental law in\nthe character and conduct of gentlemen, and never yet had anything\nbeen said to him to show that in such a theory he was mistaken.\n\nDuring all this Bridget Bolster sat there much delighted. It was not\nnecessary to her pleasure that she should say much herself. There she\nwas seated in the society of gentlemen and of men of the world, with\na cup of tea beside her, and the expectation of a little drop of\nsomething warm afterwards. What more could the world offer to her, or\nwhat more had the world to offer to anybody? As far as her feelings\nwent she did not care if Lady Mason were tried every month in the\nyear! Not that her feelings towards Lady Mason were cruel. It was\nnothing to her whether Lady Mason should be convicted or acquitted.\nBut it was much to her to sit quietly on her chair and have nothing\nto do, to eat and drink of the best, and be made much of; and it was\nvery much to her to hear the conversation of her betters.\n\nOn the following morning Dockwrath breakfasted by appointment with\nMr. Mason,--promising, however, that he would return to his friends\nwhom he left behind him, and introduce them into the court in proper\ntime. As I have before hinted, Mr. Mason's confidence in Dockwrath\nhad gone on increasing day by day since they had first met each other\nat Groby Park, till he now wished that he had altogether taken the\nadvice of the Hamworth attorney and put this matter entirely into\nhis hands. By degrees Joseph Mason had learned to understand and\nthoroughly to appreciate the strong points in his own case; and\nnow he was so fully convinced of the truth of those surmises which\nDockwrath had been the first to make, that no amount of contrary\nevidence could have shaken him. And why had not Round and Crook\nfound this out when the matter was before investigated? Why had they\nprevented him from appealing to the Lord Chancellor when, through\ntheir own carelessness, the matter had gone against him in the\ninferior court? And why did they now, even in these latter days,\nwhen they were driven to reopen the case by the clearness of the\nevidence submitted to them,--why did they even now wound his ears,\nirritate his temper, and oppose the warmest feelings of his heart by\nexpressing pity for this wicked criminal, whom it was their bounden\nduty to prosecute to the very utmost? Was it not by their fault that\nOrley Farm had been lost to him for the last twenty years? And yet\nyoung Round had told him, with the utmost composure, that it would\nbe useless for him to look for any of those moneys which should have\naccrued to him during all those years! After what had passed, young\nRound should have been anxious to grind Lucius Mason into powder, and\nmake money of his very bones! Must he not think, when he considered\nall these things, that Round and Crook had been wilfully dishonest\nto him, and that their interest had been on the side of Lady Mason?\nHe did so think at last, under the beneficent tutelage of his new\nadviser, and had it been possible would have taken the case out of\nthe hands of Round and Crook even during the week before the trial.\n\n\"We mustn't do it now,\" Dockwrath had said, in his triumph. \"If we\ndid, the whole thing would be delayed. But they shall be so watched\nthat they shall not be able to throw the thing over. I've got them in\na vice, Mr. Mason; and I'll hold them so tight that they must convict\nher whether they will or no.\"\n\nAnd the nature and extent of Mr. Dockwrath's reward had been already\nsettled. When Lucius Mason should be expelled from Orley Farm with\nignominy, he, Dockwrath, should become the tenant. The very rent was\nsettled with the understanding that it should be remitted for the\nfirst year. It would be pleasant to him to have back his two fields\nin this way;--his two fields, and something else beyond! It may be\nremembered that Lucius Mason had once gone to his office insulting\nhim. It would now be his turn to visit Lucius Mason at his domicile.\nHe was disposed to think that such visit would be made by him with\nmore effect than had attended that other.\n\n\"Well, sir, we're all right,\" he said, as he shook hands with Mr.\nMason of Groby; \"there's no screw loose that I can find.\"\n\n\"And will that man be able to speak?\" Mr. Mason was alluding to John\nKenneby.\n\n\"I think he will, as corroborating the woman Bolster. That's all we\nshall want. We shall put up the woman first; that is, after I have\ndone. I don't think they'll make much of her, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"They can't make her say that she signed two deeds if she is willing\nto tell the truth. There's no danger, you think, that she's been\ntampered with,--that she has taken money.\"\n\n\"No, no; there's been nothing of that.\"\n\n\"They'd do anything, you know,\" said Mr. Mason. \"Think of such a man\nas Solomon Aram! He's been used to it all his life, you know.\"\n\n\"They could not do it, Mr. Mason; I've been too sharp on them. And\nI tell you what,--they know it now. There isn't one of them that\ndoesn't know we shall get a verdict.\" And then for a few minutes\nthere was silence between the two friends.\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Dockwrath,\" said Mr. Mason, after a while; \"I've\nso set my heart upon this--upon getting justice at last--that I do\nthink it would kill me if I were to be beaten. I do, indeed. I've\nknown this, you know, all my life; and think what I've felt! For\ntwenty-two years, Dockwrath! By ----! in all that I have read I don't\nthink I ever heard of such a hardship! That she should have robbed\nme for two-and-twenty years!--And now they say that she will be\nimprisoned for twelve months!\"\n\n\"She'll get more than that, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"I know what would have been done to her thirty years ago, when\nthe country was in earnest about such matters. What did they do to\nFauntleroy?\"\n\n\"Things are changed since then, ain't they?\" said Dockwrath, with\na laugh. And then he went to look up his flock, and take them into\ncourt. \"I'll meet you in the hall, Mr. Mason, in twenty minutes from\nthis time.\"\n\nAnd so the play was beginning on each side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\n\nTHE FIRST DAY OF THE TRIAL.\n\n\nAnd now the judge was there on the bench, the barristers and the\nattorneys were collected, the prisoner was seated in their presence,\nand the trial was begun. As is usual in cases of much public moment,\nwhen a person of mark is put upon his purgation, or the offence is\none which has attracted notice, a considerable amount of time was\nspent in preliminaries. But we, who are not bound by the necessities\nunder which the court laboured, will pass over these somewhat\nrapidly. The prisoner was arraigned on the charge of perjury, and\npleaded \"not guilty\" in a voice which, though low, was audible to all\nthe court. At that moment the hum of voices had stayed itself, and\nthe two small words, spoken in a clear, silver tone, reached the ears\nof all that then were there assembled. Some had surmised it to be\npossible that she would at the last moment plead guilty, but such\npersons had not known Lady Mason. And then by slow degrees a jury was\nsworn, a considerable number of jurors having been set aside at the\ninstance of Lady Mason's counsel. Mr. Aram had learned to what part\nof the county each man belonged, and upon his instructions those who\ncame from the neighbourhood of Hamworth were passed over.\n\nThe comparative lightness of the offence divested the commencement\nof the trial of much of that importance and apparent dignity which\nattach themselves to most celebrated criminal cases. The prisoner was\nnot bidden to look upon the juror, nor the juror to look upon the\nprisoner, as though a battle for life and death were to be fought\nbetween them. A true bill of perjury had come down to the court from\nthe grand jury, but the court officials could not bring themselves\non such an occasion to open the case with all that solemnity and\ndeference to the prisoner which they would have exhibited had she\nbeen charged with murdering her old husband. Nor was it even the same\nas though she had been accused of forgery. Though forgery be not now\na capital crime, it was so within our memories, and there is still\na certain grandeur in the name. But perjury sounds small and petty,\nand it was not therefore till the trial had advanced a stage or two\nthat it assumed that importance which it afterwards never lost. That\nthis should be so cut Mr. Mason of Groby to the very soul. Even Mr.\nDockwrath had been unable to make him understand that his chance\nof regaining the property was under the present circumstances much\ngreater than it would have been had Lady Mason been arraigned for\nforgery. He would not believe that the act of forgery might possibly\nnot have been proved. Could she have been first whipped through the\nstreet for the misdemeanour, and then hung for the felony, his spirit\nwould not have been more than sufficiently appeased.\n\nThe case was opened by one Mr. Steelyard, the junior counsel for\nthe prosecution; but his work on this occasion was hardly more than\nformal. He merely stated the nature of the accusation against Lady\nMason, and the issue which the jury were called upon to try. Then got\nup Sir Richard Leatherham, the solicitor-general, and at great length\nand with wonderful perspicuity explained all the circumstances of\nthe case, beginning with the undoubted will left by Sir Joseph Mason,\nthe will independently of the codicil, and coming down gradually to\nthe discovery of that document in Mr. Dockwrath's office, which led\nto the surmise that the signature of those two witnesses had been\nobtained, not to a codicil to a will, but to a deed of another\ncharacter. In doing this Sir Richard did not seem to lean very\nheavily upon Lady Mason, nor did he say much as to the wrongs\nsuffered by Mr. Mason of Groby. When he alluded to Mr. Dockwrath and\nhis part in these transactions, he paid no compliment to the Hamworth\nattorney; but in referring to his learned friend on the other side\nhe protested his conviction that the defence of Lady Mason would be\nconducted not only with zeal, but in that spirit of justice and truth\nfor which the gentlemen opposite to him were so conspicuous in their\nprofession. All this was wormwood to Joseph Mason; but nevertheless,\nthough Sir Richard was so moderate as to his own side, and so\ncourteous to that opposed to him, he made it very clear before he sat\ndown that if those witnesses were prepared to swear that which he was\ninstructed they would swear, either they must be utterly unworthy of\ncredit--a fact which his learned friends opposite were as able to\nelicit as any gentlemen who had ever graced the English bar--or else\nthe prisoner now on her trial must have been guilty of the crime of\nperjury now imputed to her.\n\nOf all those in court now attending to the proceedings, none listened\nwith greater care to the statement made by Sir Richard than Joseph\nMason, Lady Mason herself, and Felix Graham. To Joseph Mason it\nappeared that his counsel was betraying him. Sir Richard and Round\nwere in a boat together and were determined to throw him over\nyet once again. Had it been possible he would have stopped the\nproceedings, and in this spirit he spoke to Dockwrath. To Joseph\nMason it would have seemed right that Sir Richard should begin by\nholding up Lady Mason to the scorn and indignation of the twelve\nhonest jurymen before him. Mr. Dockwrath, whose intelligence was\nkeener in such matters, endeavoured to make his patron understand\nthat he was wrong; but in this he did not succeed. \"If he lets her\nescape me,\" said Mason, \"I think it will be the death of me.\"\n\nTo Lady Mason it appeared as though the man who was now showing to\nall the crowd there assembled the chief scenes of her past life, had\nbeen present and seen everything that she had ever done. He told the\njury of all who had been present in the room when that true deed had\nbeen signed; he described how old Usbech had sat there incapable of\naction; how that affair of the partnership had been brought to a\nclose; how those two witnesses had thereupon appended their name to a\ndeed; how those witnesses had been deceived, or partially deceived,\nas to their own signatures when called upon to give their testimony\nat a former trial; and he told them also that a comparison of\nthe signatures on the codicil with those signatures which were\nundoubtedly true would lead an expert and professional judge of\nwriting to tell them that the one set of signatures or the other must\nbe forgeries. Then he went on to describe how the pretended codicil\nmust in truth have been executed--speaking of the solitary room in\nwhich the bad work had been done, of the midnight care and terrible\nsolicitude for secrecy. And then, with apparent mercy, he attempted\nto mitigate the iniquity of the deed by telling the jury that it had\nnot been done by that lady with any view to self-aggrandisement, but\nhad been brought about by a lamentable, infatuated, mad idea that she\nmight in this way do that justice to her child which that child's\nfather had refused to do at her instance. He also, when he told of\nthis, spoke of Rebekah and her son; and Mrs. Orme when she heard him\ndid not dare to raise her eyes from the table. Lucius Mason, when he\nhad listened to this, lifted his clenched hand on high, and brought\nit down with loud violence on the raised desk in front of him. \"I\nknow the merits of that young man,\" said Sir Richard, looking at\nhim; \"I am told that he is a gentleman, good, industrious, and high\nspirited. I wish he were not here; I wish with all my heart he were\nnot here.\" And then a tear, an absolute and true drop of briny\nmoisture, stood in the eye of that old experienced lawyer. Lucius,\nwhen he heard this, for a moment covered his face. It was but for a\nmoment, and then he looked up again, turning his eyes slowly round\nthe entire court, and as he did so grasping his mother by the arm.\n\"He'll look in a different sort of fashion by to-morrow evening, I\nguess,\" said Dockwrath into his neighbour's ear. During all this time\nno change came over Lady Mason's face. When she felt her son's hand\nupon her arm her muscles had moved involuntarily; but she recovered\nherself at the moment, and then went on enduring it all with absolute\ncomposure. Nevertheless it seemed to her as though that man who stood\nbefore her, telling his tale so calmly, had read the secrets of her\nvery soul. What chance could there be for her when everything was\nthus known?\n\nTo every word that was spoken Felix Graham gave all his mind. While\nMr. Chaffanbrass sat fidgeting, or reading, or dreaming, caring\nnothing for all that his learned brother might say, Graham listened\nto every fact that was stated, and to every surmise that was\npropounded. To him the absolute truth in this affair was matter of\ngreat moment, but yet he felt that he dreaded to know the truth.\nWould it not be better for him that he should not know it? But yet he\nlistened, and his active mind, intent on the various points as they\nwere evolved, would not restrain itself from forming opinions. With\nall his ears he listened, and as he did so Mr. Chaffanbrass, amidst\nhis dreaming, reading, and fidgeting, kept an attentive eye upon him.\nTo him it was a matter of course that Lady Mason should be guilty.\nHad she not been guilty, he, Mr. Chaffanbrass, would not have been\nrequired. Mr. Chaffanbrass well understood that the defence of\ninjured innocence was no part of his mission.\n\nThen at last Sir Richard Leatherham brought to a close his long tale,\nand the examination of the witnesses was commenced. By this time\nit was past two o'clock, and the judge went out of court for a few\nminutes to refresh himself with a glass of wine and a sandwich. And\nnow young Peregrine Orme, in spite of all obstacles, made his way up\nto his mother and led her also out of court. He took his mother's\narm, and Lady Mason followed with her son, and so they made their way\ninto the small outer room which they had first entered. Not a word\nwas said between them on the subject which was filling the minds of\nall of them. Lucius stood silent and absorbed while Peregrine offered\nrefreshment to both the ladies. Lady Mason, doing as she was bid,\nessayed to eat and to drink. What was it to her whether she ate and\ndrank or was a-hungered? To maintain by her demeanour the idea in\nmen's minds that she might still possibly be innocent--that was her\nwork. And therefore, in order that those two young men might still\nthink so, she ate and drank as she was bidden.\n\nOn their return to court Mr. Steelyard got up to examine Dockwrath,\nwho was put into the box as the first witness. The attorney produced\ncertain documents supposed to be of relevancy, which he had found\namong his father-in-law's papers, and then described how he had found\nthat special document which gave him to understand that Bolster and\nKenneby had been used as witnesses to a certain signature on that\n14th of July. He had known all the circumstances of the old trial,\nand hence his suspicions had been aroused. Acting upon this he had\ngone immediately down to Mr. Mason in Yorkshire, and the present\ntrial was the result of his care and intelligence. This was in effect\nthe purport of his direct evidence, and then he was handed over to\nthe tender mercies of the other side.\n\nOn the other side Mr. Chaffanbrass rose to begin the battle. Mr.\nFurnival had already been engaged in sundry of those preliminary\nskirmishes which had been found necessary before the fight had been\ncommenced in earnest, and therefore the turn had now come for Mr.\nChaffanbrass. All this, however, had been arranged beforehand, and\nit had been agreed that if possible Dockwrath should be made to fall\ninto the clutches of the Old Bailey barrister. It was pretty to see\nthe meek way in which Mr. Chaffanbrass rose to his work; how gently\nhe smiled, how he fidgeted about a few of the papers as though he\nwere not at first quite master of his situation, and how he arranged\nhis old wig in a modest, becoming manner, bringing it well forward\nover his forehead. His voice also was low and soft;--so low that\nit was hardly heard through the whole court, and persons who had\ncome far to listen to him began to feel themselves disappointed.\nAnd it was pretty also to see how Dockwrath armed himself for the\nencounter,--how he sharpened his teeth, as it were, and felt the\npoints of his own claws. The little devices of Mr. Chaffanbrass did\nnot deceive him. He knew what he had to expect; but his pluck was\ngood, as is the pluck of a terrier when a mastiff prepares to attack\nhim. Let Mr. Chaffanbrass do his worst; that would all be over in an\nhour or so. But when Mr. Chaffanbrass had done his worst, Orley Farm\nwould still remain.\n\n\"I believe you were a tenant of Lady Mason's at one time, Mr.\nDockwrath?\" asked the barrister.\n\n\"I was; and she turned me out. If you will allow me I will tell\nyou how all that happened, and how I was angered by the usage I\nreceived.\" Mr. Dockwrath was determined to make a clean breast of it,\nand rather go before his tormentor in telling all that there was to\nbe told, than lag behind as an unwilling witness.\n\n\"Do,\" said Mr. Chaffanbrass. \"That will be very kind of you. When I\nhave learned all that, and one other little circumstance of the same\nnature, I do not think I shall want to trouble you any more.\" And\nthen Mr. Dockwrath did tell it all;--how he had lost the two fields,\nhow he had thus become very angry, how this anger had induced him at\nonce to do that which he had long thought of doing,--search, namely,\namong the papers of old Mr. Usbech, with the view of ascertaining\nwhat might be the real truth as regarded that doubtful codicil.\n\n\"And you found what you searched for, Mr. Dockwrath?\"\n\n\"I did,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"Without very much delay, apparently?\"\n\n\"I was two or three days over the work.\"\n\n\"But you found exactly what you wanted?\"\n\n\"I found what I expected to find.\"\n\n\"And that, although all those papers had been subjected to the\nscrutiny of Messrs. Round and Crook at the time of that other trial\ntwenty years ago?\"\n\n\"I was sharper than them, Mr. Chaffanbrass,--a deal sharper.\"\n\n\"So I perceive,\" said Chaffanbrass, and now he had pushed back his\nwig a little, and his eyes had begun to glare with an ugly red light.\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"it will be long, I think, before my old friends\nRound and Crook are as sharp as you are, Mr. Dockwrath.\"\n\n\"Upon my word I agree with you, Mr. Chaffanbrass.\"\n\n\"Yes; Round and Crook are babies to you, Mr. Dockwrath;\" and now Mr.\nChaffanbrass began to pick at his chin with his finger, as he was\naccustomed to do when he warmed to his subject. \"Babies to you! You\nhave had a good deal to do with them, I should say, in getting up\nthis case.\"\n\n\"I have had something to do with them.\"\n\n\"And very much they must have enjoyed your society, Mr. Dockwrath!\nAnd what wrinkles they must have learned from you! What a pleasant\noasis it must have been in the generally somewhat dull course of\ntheir monotonous though profitable business! I quite envy Round and\nCrook having you alongside of them in their inner council-chamber.\"\n\n\"I know nothing about that, sir.\"\n\n\"No; I dare say you don't;--but they'll remember it. Well, when you'd\nturned over your father-in-law's papers for three days you found what\nyou looked for?\"\n\n\"Yes, I did.\"\n\n\"You had been tolerably sure that you would find it before you began,\neh?\"\n\n\"Well, I had expected that something would turn up.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you did,--and something has turned up. That\ngentleman sitting next to you there,--who is he?\"\n\n\"Joseph Mason, Esquire, of Groby Park,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"So I thought. It is he that is to have Orley Farm, if Lady Mason and\nher son should lose it?\"\n\n\"In that case he would be the heir.\"\n\n\"Exactly. He would be the heir. How pleasant it must be to you to\nfind yourself on such affectionate terms with--the heir! And when\nhe comes into his inheritance, who is to be tenant? Can you tell us\nthat?\"\n\nDockwrath here paused for a moment. Not that he hesitated as to\ntelling the whole truth. He had fully made up his mind to do so,\nand to brazen the matter out, declaring that of course he was to be\nconsidered worthy of his reward. But there was that in the manner and\neye of Chaffanbrass which stopped him for a moment, and his enemy\nimmediately took advantage of this hesitation. \"Come sir,\" said he,\n\"out with it. If I don't get it from you, I shall from somebody else.\nYou've been very plain-spoken hitherto. Don't let the jury think that\nyour heart is failing you at last.\"\n\n\"There is no reason why my heart should fail me,\" said Dockwrath, in\nan angry tone.\n\n\"Is there not? I must differ from you there, Mr. Dockwrath. The heart\nof any man placed in such a position as that you now hold must, I\nthink, fail him. But never mind that. Who is to be the tenant of\nOrley Farm when my client has been deprived of it?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"Just so. You were turned out from those two fields when young Mason\ncame home from Germany?\"\n\n\"I was.\"\n\n\"You immediately went to work and discovered this document?\"\n\n\"I did.\"\n\n\"You put up Joseph Mason to this trial?\"\n\n\"I told him my opinion.\"\n\n\"Exactly. And if the result be successful, you are to be put in\npossession of the land.\"\n\n\"I shall become Mr. Mason's tenant at Orley Farm.\"\n\n\"Yes, you will become Mr. Mason's tenant at Orley Farm. Upon my word,\nMr. Dockwrath, you have made my work to-day uncommonly easy for\nme,--uncommonly easy. I don't know that I have anything else to ask\nyou.\" And then Mr. Chaffanbrass, as he sat down, looked up to the\njury with an expression of countenance which was in itself worth any\nfee that could be paid to him for that day's work. His face spoke as\nplain as a face could speak, and what his face said was this: \"After\nthat, gentlemen of the jury, very little more can be necessary. You\nnow see the motives of our opponents, and the way in which those\nmotives have been allowed to act. We, who are altogether upon the\nsquare in what we are doing, desire nothing more than that.\" All\nwhich Mr. Chaffanbrass said by his look, his shrug, and his gesture,\nmuch more eloquently than he could have done by the use of any words.\n\nMr. Dockwrath, as he left the box and went back to his seat--in\ndoing which he had to cross the table in the middle of the\ncourt--endeavoured to look and move as though all were right with\nhim. He knew that the eyes of the court were on him, and especially\nthe eyes of the judge and jury. He knew also how men's minds are\nunconsciously swayed by small appearances. He endeavoured therefore\nto seem indifferent; but in doing so he swaggered, and was conscious\nthat he swaggered; and he felt as he gained his seat that Mr.\nChaffanbrass had been too much for him.\n\nThen one Mr. Torrington from London was examined by Sir Richard\nLeatherham, and he proved, apparently beyond all doubt, that a\ncertain deed which he produced was genuine. That deed bore the same\ndate as the codicil which was now questioned, had been executed at\nOrley Farm by old Sir Joseph, and bore the signatures of John Kenneby\nand Bridget Bolster as witnesses. Sir Richard, holding the deeds in\nhis hands, explained to the jury that he did not at the present stage\nof the proceedings ask them to take it as proved that those names\nwere the true signatures of the two persons indicated. (\"I should\nthink not,\" said Mr. Furnival, in a loud voice.) But he asked them to\nsatisfy themselves that the document as now existing purported to\nbear those two signatures. It would be for them to judge, when the\nevidence brought before them should be complete, whether or no that\ndeed were a true document. And then the deed was handed up into the\njury-box, and the twelve jurymen all examined it. The statement made\nby this Mr. Torrington was very simple. It had become his business\nto know the circumstances of the late partnership between Mason and\nMartock, and these circumstances he explained. Then Sir Richard\nhanded him over to be cross-examined.\n\nIt was now Graham's turn to begin his work; but as he rose to do so\nhis mind misgave him. Not a syllable that this Torrington had said\nappeared to him to be unworthy of belief. The man had not uttered a\nword, of the truth of which Graham did not feel himself positively\nassured; and, more than that,--the man had clearly told all that was\nwithin him to tell, all that it was well that the jury should hear\nin order that they might thereby be assisted in coming to a true\ndecision. It had been hinted in his hearing, both by Chaffanbrass and\nAram, that this man was probably in league with Dockwrath, and Aram\nhad declared with a sneer that he was a puzzle-pated old fellow. He\nmight be puzzle-pated, and had already shown that he was bashful and\nunhappy in his present position; but he had shown also, as Graham\nthought, that he was anxious to tell the truth.\n\nAnd, moreover, Graham had listened with all his mind to the\ncross-examination of Dockwrath, and he was filled with disgust--with\ndisgust, not so much at the part played by the attorney as at that\nplayed by the barrister. As Graham regarded the matter, what had the\niniquities and greed of Dockwrath to do with it? Had reason been\nshown why the statement made by Dockwrath was in itself unworthy of\nbelief,--that that statement was in its own essence weak,--then the\ncharacter of the man making it might fairly affect its credibility.\nBut presuming that statement to be wrong,--presuming that it was\ncorroborated by other evidence, how could it be affected by any\namount of villainy on the part of Dockwrath? All that Chaffanbrass\nhad done or attempted was to prove that Dockwrath had had his own\nend to serve. Who had ever doubted it? But not a word had been said,\nnot a spark of evidence elicited, to show that the man had used a\nfalsehood to further those views of his. Of all this the mind of\nFelix Graham had been full; and now, as he rose to take his own share\nof the work, his wit was at work rather in opposition to Lady Mason\nthan on her behalf.\n\nThis Torrington was a little old man, and Graham had watched how his\nhands had trembled when Sir Richard first addressed him. But Sir\nRichard had been very kind,--as was natural to his own witness, and\nthe old man had gradually regained his courage. But now as he turned\nhis face round to the side where he knew that he might expect to\nfind an enemy, that tremor again came upon him, and the stick which\nhe held in his hand was heard as it tapped gently against the side\nof the witness-box. Graham, as he rose to his work, saw that Mr.\nChaffanbrass had fixed his eye upon him, and his courage rose the\nhigher within him as he felt the gaze of the man whom he so much\ndisliked. Was it within the compass of his heart to bully an old man\nbecause such a one as Chaffanbrass desired it of him? By heaven, no!\n\nHe first asked Mr. Torrington his age, and having been told that he\nwas over seventy, Graham went on to assure him that nothing which\ncould be avoided should be said to disturb his comfort. \"And now, Mr.\nTorrington,\" he asked, \"will you tell me whether you are a friend of\nMr. Dockwrath's, or have had any acquaintance with him previous to\nthe affairs of this trial?\" This question he repeated in various\nforms, but always in a mild voice, and without the appearance of any\ndisbelief in the answers which were given to him. All these questions\nTorrington answered by a plain negative. He had never seen Dockwrath\ntill the attorney had come to him on the matter of that partnership\ndeed. He had never eaten or drunk with him, nor had there ever been\nbetween them any conversation of a confidential nature. \"That will\ndo, Mr. Torrington,\" said Graham; and as he sat down, he again turned\nround and looked Mr. Chaffanbrass full in the face.\n\nAfter that nothing further of interest was done that day. A few\nunimportant witnesses were examined on legal points, and then the\ncourt was adjourned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX.\n\nTHE TWO JUDGES.\n\n\nFelix Graham as he left the Alston court-house on the close of the\nfirst day of the trial was not in a happy state of mind. He did not\nactually accuse himself of having omitted any duty which he owed to\nhis client; but he did accuse himself of having undertaken a duty for\nwhich he felt himself to be manifestly unfit. Would it not have been\nbetter, as he said to himself, for that poor lady to have had any\nother possible advocate than himself? Then as he passed out in the\ncompany of Mr. Furnival and Mr. Chaffanbrass, the latter looked at\nhim with a scorn which he did not know how to return. In his heart he\ncould do so; and should words be spoken between them on the subject,\nhe would be well able and willing enough to defend himself. But had\nhe attempted to bandy looks with Mr. Chaffanbrass, it would have\nseemed even to himself that he was proclaiming his resolution to put\nhimself in opposition to his colleagues.\n\nHe felt as though he were engaged to fight a battle in which truth\nand justice, nay heaven itself must be against him. How can a man\nput his heart to the proof of an assertion in the truth of which he\nhimself has no belief? That though guilty this lady should be treated\nwith the utmost mercy compatible with the law;--for so much, had her\nguilt stood forward as acknowledged, he could have pleaded with all\nthe eloquence that was in him. He could still pity her, sympathise\nwith her, fight for her on such ground as that; but was it possible\nthat he, believing her to be false, should stand up before the crowd\nassembled in that court, and use such intellect as God had given him\nin making others think that the false and the guilty one was true and\ninnocent, and that those accusers were false and guilty whom he knew\nto be true and innocent?\n\nIt had been arranged that Baron Maltby should stay that night at\nNoningsby. The brother-judges therefore occupied the Noningsby\ncarriage together, and Graham was driven back in a dog-cart by\nAugustus Staveley.\n\n\"Well, old boy,\" said Augustus, \"you did not soil your conscience\nmuch by bullying that fellow.\"\n\n\"No, I did not,\" said Graham; and then he was silent.\n\n\"Chaffanbrass made an uncommonly ugly show of the Hamworth attorney,\"\nsaid Augustus, after a pause; but to this Graham at first made no\nanswer.\n\n\"If I were on the jury,\" continued the other, \"I would not believe a\nsingle word that came from that fellow's mouth, unless it were fully\nsupported by other testimony. Nor will the jury believe him.\"\n\n\"I tell you what, Staveley,\" said Graham, \"you will oblige me greatly\nin this matter if you will not speak to me of the trial till it is\nover.\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"No; don't do that. Nothing can be more natural than that you and\nI should discuss it together in all its bearings. But there are\nreasons, which I will explain to you afterwards, why I would rather\nnot do so.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Augustus. \"I'll not say another word.\"\n\n\"And for my part, I will get through the work as well as I may.\" And\nthen they both sat silent in the gig till they came to the corner of\nNoningsby wall.\n\n\"And is that other subject tabooed also?\" said Augustus.\n\n\"What other subject?\"\n\n\"That as to which we said something when you were last\nhere,--touching my sister Madeline.\"\n\nGraham felt that his face was on fire, but he did not know how to\nanswer. \"In that it is for you to decide whether or no there should\nbe silence between us,\" he said at last.\n\n\"I certainly do not wish that there should be any secret between us,\"\nsaid Augustus.\n\n\"Then there shall be none. It is my intention to make an offer to\nher before I leave Noningsby. I can assure you for your satisfaction,\nthat my hopes do not run very high.\"\n\n\"For my satisfaction, Felix! I don't know why you should suppose me\nto be anxious that you should fail.\" And as he so spoke he stopped\nhis horse at the hall-door, and there was no time for further speech.\n\n\"Papa has been home a quarter of an hour,\" said Madeline, meeting\nthem in the hall.\n\n\"Yes, he had the pull of us by having his carriage ready,\" said her\nbrother. \"We had to wait for the ostler.\"\n\n\"He says that if you are not ready in ten minutes he will go to\ndinner without you. Mamma and I are dressed.\" And as she spoke she\nturned round with a smile to Felix, making him feel that both she and\nher father were treating him as though he were one of the family.\n\n\"Ten minutes will be quite enough for me,\" said he.\n\n\"If the governor only would sit down,\" said Augustus, \"it would be\nall right. But that's just what he won't do. Mad, do send somebody to\nhelp me to unpack.\" And then they all bustled away, so that the pair\nof judges might not be kept waiting for their food.\n\nFelix Graham hurried up stairs, three steps at a time, as though all\nhis future success at Noningsby depended on his being down in the\ndrawing-room within the period of minutes stipulated by the judge.\nAs he dressed himself with the utmost rapidity, thinking perhaps not\nso much as he should have done of his appearance in the eyes of his\nlady-love, he endeavoured to come to some resolve as to the task\nwhich was before him. How was he to find an opportunity of speaking\nhis mind to Madeline, if, during the short period of his sojourn at\nNoningsby, he left the house every morning directly after breakfast,\nand returned to it in the evening only just in time for dinner?\n\nWhen he entered the drawing-room both the judges were there, as was\nalso Lady Staveley and Madeline. Augustus alone was wanting. \"Ring\nthe bell, Graham,\" the judge said, as Felix took his place on the\ncorner of the rug. \"Augustus will be down about supper-time.\" And\nthen the bell was rung and the dinner ordered.\n\n\"Papa ought to remember,\" said Madeline, \"that he got his carriage\nfirst at Alston.\"\n\n\"I heard the wheels of the gig,\" said the judge. \"They were just two\nminutes after us.\"\n\n\"I don't think Augustus takes longer than other young men,\" said Lady\nStaveley.\n\n\"Look at Graham there. He can't be supposed to have the use of all\nhis limbs, for he broke half a dozen of them a month ago; and yet\nhe's ready. Brother Maltby, give your arm to Lady Staveley. Graham,\nif you'll take Madeline, I'll follow alone.\" He did not call her Miss\nStaveley, as Felix specially remarked, and so remarking, pressed the\nlittle hand somewhat closer to his side. It was the first sign of\nlove he had ever given her, and he feared that some mark of anger\nmight follow it. There was no return to his pressure;--not the\nslightest answer was made with those sweet finger points; but there\nwas no anger. \"Is your arm quite strong again?\" she asked him as they\nsat down, as soon as the judge's short grace had been uttered.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes to the second,\" said Augustus, bustling into the\nroom, \"and I think that an unfair advantage has been taken of me. But\nwhat can a juvenile barrister expect in the presence of two judges?\"\nAnd then the dinner went on, and a very pleasant little dinner-party\nit was.\n\nNot a word was said, either then or during the evening, or on the\nfollowing morning, on that subject which was engrossing so much of\nthe mind of all of them. Not a word was spoken as to that trial which\nwas now pending, nor was the name of Lady Mason mentioned. It was\nunderstood even by Madeline that no allusion could with propriety be\nmade to it in the presence of the judge before whom the cause was now\npending, and the ground was considered too sacred for feet to tread\nupon it. Were it not that this feeling is so general an English judge\nand English counsellors would almost be forced to subject themselves\nin such cases to the close custody which jurymen are called upon to\nendure. But, as a rule, good taste and good feeling are as potent as\nlocks and walls.\n\n\"Do you know, Mr. Graham,\" said Madeline, in that sort of whisper\nwhich a dinner-table allows, \"that Mrs. Baker says you have cut her\nsince you got well.\"\n\n\"I! I cut one of my very best friends! How can she say anything so\nuntrue? If I knew where she lived I'd go and pay her a visit after\ndinner.\"\n\n\"I don't think you need do that,--though she has a very snug little\nroom of her own. You were in it on Christmas-day when we had the\nsnapdragon,--when you and Marion carried away the dishes.\"\n\n\"I remember. And she is base enough to say that I have cut her? I did\nsee her for a moment yesterday, and then I spoke to her.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you should have had a long chat with her. She expects you\nto go back over all the old ground, how you were brought in helpless,\nhow the doctor came to you, and how you took all the messes she\nprepared for you like a good boy. I'm afraid, Mr. Graham, you don't\nunderstand old women.\"\n\n\"Nor young ones either,\" it was on his tongue to say, but he did not\nsay it.\n\n\"When I was a young man,\" said the baron, carrying on some\nconversation which had been general at the table, \"I never had an\nopportunity of breaking my ribs out hunting.\"\n\n\"Perhaps if you had,\" said Augustus, \"you might have used it with\nmore effect than my friend here, and have deprived the age of one\nof its brightest lights, and the bench of one of its most splendid\nornaments.\"\n\n\"Hear, hear, hear!\" said his father.\n\n\"Augustus is coming out in a new character,\" said his mother.\n\n\"I am heartily obliged to him,\" said the baron. \"But, as I was saying\nbefore, these sort of things never came in my way. If I remember\nright, my father would have thought I was mad had I talked of going\nout hunting. Did you hunt, Staveley?\"\n\nWhen the ladies were gone the four lawyers talked about law, though\nthey kept quite clear of that special trial which was going on at\nAlston. Judge Staveley, as we know, had been at the Birmingham\ncongress; but not so his brother the baron. Baron Maltby, indeed,\nthought but little of the Birmingham doings, and was inclined to be a\nlittle hard upon his brother in that he had taken a part in it.\n\n\"I think that the matter is one open to discussion,\" said the host.\n\n\"Well, I hope so,\" said Graham. \"At any rate I have heard no\narguments which ought to make us feel that our mouths are closed.\"\n\n\"Arguments on such a matter are worth nothing at all,\" said the\nbaron. \"A man with what is called a logical turn of mind may prove\nanything or disprove anything; but he never convinces anybody. On any\nmatter that is near to a man's heart, he is convinced by the tenour\nof his own thoughts as he goes on living, not by the arguments of a\nlogician, or even by the eloquence of an orator. Talkers are apt to\nthink that if their listener cannot answer them they are bound to\ngive way; but non-talkers generally take a very different view of the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"But does that go to show that a question should not be ventilated?\"\nasked Felix.\n\n\"I don't mean to be uncivil,\" said the baron, \"but of all words in\nthe language there is none which I dislike so much as that word\nventilation. A man given to ventilating subjects is worse than a man\nwho has a mission.\"\n\n\"Bores of that sort, however,\" said Graham, \"will show themselves\nfrom time to time and are not easily put down. Some one will have a\nmission to reform our courts of law, and will do it too.\"\n\n\"I only hope it may not be in my time,\" said the baron.\n\n\"I can't go quite so far as that,\" said the other judge. \"But no\ndoubt we all have the same feeling more or less. I know pretty well\nwhat my friend Graham is driving at.\"\n\n\"And in your heart you agree with me,\" said Graham.\n\n\"If you would carry men's heads with you they would do you more good\nthan their hearts,\" said the judge. And then as the wine bottles\nwere stationary, the subject was cut short and they went into the\ndrawing-room.\n\nGraham had no opportunity that evening of telling his tale to\nMadeline Staveley. The party was too large for such tale-telling or\nelse not large enough. And then the evening in the drawing-room was\nover before it had seemed to begin; and while he was yet hoping that\nthere might be some turn in his favour, Lady Staveley wished him\ngood-night, and Madeline of course did the same. As he again pressed\nher hand he could not but think how little he had said to her since\nhe had been in the house, and yet it seemed to him as though that\nlittle had made him more intimate with her than he had ever found\nhimself before. He had made an attempt to separate himself from\nthe company by proposing to go and call on Mrs. Baker in her own\nquarters; but Madeline had declared it to be too late for such an\nexpedition, explaining that when Mrs. Baker had no patient on hand\nshe was accustomed to go early to her bed. In the present instance,\nhowever, she had been wrong, for when Felix reached the door of his\nown room, Mrs. Baker was coming out of it.\n\n\"I was just looking if everything was right,\" said she. \"It seems\nnatural to me to come and look after you, you know.\"\n\n\"And it is quite as natural to me to be looked after.\"\n\n\"Is it though? But the worst of you gentlemen when you get well is\nthat one has done with you. You go away, and then there's no more\nabout it. I always begrudge to see you get well for that reason.\"\n\n\"When you have a man in your power you like to keep him there.\"\n\n\"That's always the way with the women you know. I hope we shall see\none of them tying you by the leg altogether before long.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that,\" said Felix, sheepishly.\n\n\"Don't you? Well, if you don't I suppose nobody don't. But\nnevertheless I did hear a little bird say--eh! Mr. Graham.\"\n\n\"Those little birds are the biggest liars in the world.\"\n\n\"Are they now? Well perhaps they are. And how do you think our Miss\nMadeline is looking? She wasn't just well for one short time after\nyou went away.\"\n\n\"Has she been ill?\"\n\n\"Well, not ill; not so that she came into my hands. She's looking\nherself again now, isn't she?\"\n\n\"She is looking, as she always does, uncommonly well.\"\n\n\"Do you remember how she used to come and say a word to you standing\nat the door? Dear heart! I'll be bound now I care more for her than\nyou do.\"\n\n\"Do you?\" said Graham.\n\n\"Of course I do. And then how angry her ladyship was with me,--as\nthough it were my fault. I didn't do it. Did I, Mr. Graham? But,\nLord love you, what's the use of being angry? My lady ought to have\nremembered her own young days, for it was just the same thing with\nher. She had her own way, and so will Miss Madeline.\" And then with\nsome further inquiries as to his fire, his towels, and his sheets,\nMrs. Baker took herself off.\n\nFelix Graham had felt a repugnance to taking the gossiping old woman\nopenly into his confidence, and yet he had almost asked her whether\nhe might in truth count upon Madeline's love. Such at any rate had\nbeen the tenour of his gossiping; but nevertheless he was by no means\ncertified. He had the judge's assurance in allowing him to be there;\nhe had the assurance given to him by Augustus in the few words spoken\nto him at the door that evening; and he ought to have known that he\nhad received sufficient assurance from Madeline herself. But in truth\nhe knew nothing of the kind. There are men who are much too forward\nin believing that they are regarded with favour; but there are others\nof whom it may be said that they are as much too backward. The world\nhears most of the former, and talks of them the most, but I doubt\nwhether the latter are not the more numerous.\n\nThe next morning of course there was a hurry and fuss at breakfast in\norder that they might get off in time for the courts. The judges were\nto take their seats at ten, and therefore it was necessary that they\nshould sit down to breakfast some time before nine. The achievement\ndoes not seem to be one of great difficulty, but nevertheless it left\nno time for lovemaking.\n\nBut for one instant Felix was able to catch Madeline alone in the\nbreakfast-parlour. \"Miss Staveley,\" said he, \"will it be possible\nthat I should speak to you alone this evening;--for five minutes?\"\n\n\"Speak to me alone?\" she said, repeating his words; and as she did\nso she was conscious that her whole face had become suffused with\ncolour.\n\n\"Is it too much to ask?\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"Then if I leave the dining-room soon after you have done so--\"\n\n\"Mamma will be there, you know,\" she said. Then others came into the\nroom and he was able to make no further stipulation for the evening.\n\nMadeline, when she was left alone that morning, was by no means\nsatisfied with her own behaviour, and accused herself of having been\nunnecessarily cold to him. She knew the permission which had been\naccorded to him, and she knew also--knew well--what answer would\nbe given to his request. In her mind the matter was now fixed. She\nhad confessed to herself that she loved him, and she could not now\ndoubt of his love to her. Why then should she have answered him with\ncoldness and doubt? She hated the missishness of young ladies, and\nhad resolved that when he asked her a plain question she would give\nhim a plain answer. It was true that the question had not been asked\nas yet; but why should she have left him in doubt as to her kindly\nfeeling?\n\n\"It shall be but for this one day,\" she said to herself as she sat\nalone in her room.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX.\n\nHOW AM I TO BEAR IT?\n\n\nWhen the first day's work was over in the court, Lady Mason and\nMrs. Orme kept their seats till the greater part of the crowd\nhad dispersed, and the two young men, Lucius Mason and Peregrine,\nremained with them. Mr. Aram also remained, giving them sundry little\ninstructions in a low voice as to the manner in which they should go\nhome and return the next morning,--telling them the hour at which\nthey must start, and promising that he would meet them at the door\nof the court. To all this Mrs. Orme endeavoured to give her best\nattention, as though it were of the last importance; but Lady Mason\nwas apparently much the more collected of the two, and seemed to take\nall Mr. Aram's courtesies as though they were a matter of course.\nThere she sat, still with her veil up, and though all those who had\nbeen assembled there during the day turned their eyes upon her as\nthey passed out, she bore it all without quailing. It was not that\nshe returned their gaze, or affected an effrontery in her conduct;\nbut she was able to endure it without showing that she suffered as\nshe did so.\n\n\"The carriage is there now,\" said Mr. Aram, who had left the court\nfor a minute; \"and I think you may get into it quietly.\" This\naccordingly they did, making their way through an avenue of idlers\nwho still remained that they might look upon the lady who was accused\nof having forged her husband's will.\n\n[Illustration: Lady Mason leaving the Court.]\n\n\"I will stay with her to-night,\" whispered Mrs. Orme to her son as\nthey passed through the court.\n\n\"Do you mean that you will not come to The Cleeve at all?\"\n\n\"Not to-night; not till the trial be over. Do you remain with your\ngrandfather.\"\n\n\"I shall be here to-morrow of course to see how you go on.\"\n\n\"But do not leave your grandfather this evening. Give him my love,\nand say that I think it best that I should remain at Orley Farm till\nthe trial be over. And, Peregrine, if I were you I would not talk to\nhim much about the trial.\"\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\"I will tell you when it is over. But it would only harass him at\nthe present moment.\" And then Peregrine handed his mother into the\ncarriage and took his own way back to The Cleeve.\n\nAs he returned he was bewildered in his mind by what he had heard,\nand he also began to feel something like a doubt as to Lady Mason's\ninnocence. Hitherto his belief in it had been as fixed and assured as\nthat of her own son. Indeed it had never occurred to him as possible\nthat she could have done the thing with which she was charged. He\nhad hated Joseph Mason for suspecting her, and had hated Dockwrath\nfor his presumed falsehood in pretending to suspect her. But\nwhat was he to think of this question now, after hearing the\nclear and dispassionate statement of all the circumstances by the\nsolicitor-general? Hitherto he had understood none of the particulars\nof the case; but now the nature of the accusation had been made\nplain, and it was evident to him that at any rate that far-sighted\nlawyer believed in the truth of his own statement. Could it be\npossible that Lady Mason had forged the will,--that this deed had\nbeen done by his mother's friend, by the woman who had so nearly\nbecome Lady Orme of The Cleeve? The idea was terrible to him as he\nrode home, but yet he could not rid himself of it. And if this were\nso, was it also possible that his grandfather suspected it? Had that\nmarriage been stopped by any such suspicion as this? Was it this that\nhad broken the old man down and robbed him of all his spirit? That\nhis mother could not have any such suspicion seemed to him to be made\nclear by the fact that she still treated Lady Mason as her friend.\nAnd then why had he been specially enjoined not to speak to his\ngrandfather as to the details of the trial?\n\nBut it was impossible for him to meet Sir Peregrine without speaking\nof the trial. When he entered the house, which he did by some back\nentrance from the stables, he found his grandfather standing at his\nown room door. He had heard the sounds of the horse, and was unable\nto restrain his anxiety to learn.\n\n\"Well,\" said Sir Peregrine, \"what has happened?\"\n\n\"It is not over as yet. It will last, they say, for three days.\"\n\n\"But come in, Peregrine;\" and he shut the door, anxious rather that\nthe servants should not witness his own anxiety than that they should\nnot hear tidings which must now be common to all the world. \"They\nhave begun it?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! they have begun it.\"\n\n\"Well, how far has it gone?\"\n\n\"Sir Richard Leatherham told us the accusation they make against her,\nand then they examined Dockwrath and one or two others. They have not\ngot further than that.\"\n\n\"And the--Lady Mason--how does she bear it?\"\n\n\"Very well I should say. She does not seem to be nearly as nervous\nnow, as she was while staying with us.\"\n\n\"Ah! indeed. She is a wonderful woman,--a very wonderful woman. So\nshe bears up? And your mother, Peregrine?\"\n\n\"I don't think she likes it.\"\n\n\"Likes it! Who could like such a task as that?\"\n\n\"But she will go through with it.\"\n\n\"I am sure she will. She will go through with anything that she\nundertakes. And--and--the judge said nothing--I suppose?\"\n\n\"Very little, sir.\"\n\nAnd Sir Peregrine again sat down in his arm-chair as though the work\nof conversation were too much for him. But neither did he dare to\nspeak openly on the subject; and yet there was so much that he was\nanxious to know. Do you think she will escape? That was the question\nwhich he longed to ask but did not dare to utter.\n\nAnd then, after a while, they dined together. And Peregrine\ndetermined to talk of other things; but it was in vain. While the\nservants were in the room nothing was said. The meat was carved and\nthe plates were handed round, and young Orme ate his dinner; but\nthere was a constraint upon them both which they were quite unable to\ndispel, and at last they gave it up and sat in silence till they were\nalone.\n\nWhen the door was closed, and they were opposite to each other over\nthe fire, in the way which was their custom when they two only were\nthere, Sir Peregrine could restrain his desire no longer. It must be\nthat his grandson, who had heard all that had passed in court that\nday, should have formed some opinion of what was going on,--should\nhave some idea as to the chance of that battle which was being\nfought. He, Sir Peregrine, could not have gone into the court\nhimself. It would have been impossible for him to show himself there.\nBut there had been his heart all the day. How had it gone with that\nwoman whom a few weeks ago he had loved so well that he had regarded\nher as his wife?\n\n\"Was your mother very tired?\" he said, again endeavouring to draw\nnear the subject.\n\n\"She did looked fagged while sitting in court.\"\n\n\"It was a dreadful task for her,--very dreadful.\"\n\n\"Nothing could have turned her from it,\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"No,--you are right there. Nothing would have turned her from it. She\nthought it to be her duty to that poor lady. But she--Lady Mason--she\nbore it better, you say?\"\n\n\"I think she bears it very well,--considering what her position is.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. It is very dreadful. The solicitor-general when he\nopened,--was he very severe upon her?\"\n\n\"I do not think he wished to be severe.\"\n\n\"But he made it very strong against her.\"\n\n\"The story, as he told it, was very strong against her;--that is, you\nknow, it would be if we were to believe all that he stated.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, of course. He only stated what he has been told by others.\nYou could not see how the jury took it?\"\n\n\"I did not look at them. I was thinking more of her and of Lucius.\"\n\n\"Lucius was there?\"\n\n\"Yes; he sat next to her. And Sir Richard said, while he was telling\nthe story, that he wished her son were not there to hear it. Upon my\nword, sir, I almost wished so too.\"\n\n\"Poor fellow,--poor fellow! It would have been better for him to stay\naway.\"\n\n\"And yet had it been my mother--\"\n\n\"Your mother, Perry! It could not have been your mother. She could\nnot have been so placed.\"\n\n\"If it be Lady Mason's misfortune, and not her fault--\"\n\n\"Ah, well; we will not talk about that. And there will be two days\nmore you say?\"\n\n\"So said Aram, the attorney.\"\n\n\"God help her;--may God help her! It would be very dreadful for a\nman, but for a woman the burden is insupportable.\"\n\nThen they both sat silent for a while, during which Peregrine was\nengrossed in thinking how he could turn his grandfather from the\nconversation.\n\n\"And you heard no one express any opinion?\" asked Sir Peregrine,\nafter a pause.\n\n\"You mean about Lady Mason?\" And Peregrine began to perceive that his\nmother was right, and that it would have been well if possible to\navoid any words about the trial.\n\n\"Do they think that she will--will be acquitted? Of course the people\nthere were talking about it?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, they were talking about it. But I really don't know as to\nany opinion. You see, the chief witnesses have not been examined.\"\n\n\"And you, Perry, what do you think?\"\n\n\"I, sir! Well, I was altogether on her side till I heard Sir Richard\nLeatherham.\"\n\n\"And then--?\"\n\n\"Then I did not know what to think. I suppose it's all right; but one\nnever can understand what those lawyers are at. When Mr. Chaffanbrass\ngot up to examine Dockwrath, he seemed to be just as confident on his\nside as the other fellow had been on the other side. I don't think\nI'll have any more wine, sir, thank you.\"\n\nBut Sir Peregrine did not move. He sat in his old accustomed way,\nnursing one leg over the knee of the other, and thinking of the\nmanner in which she had fallen at his feet, and confessed it all.\nHad he married her, and gone with her proudly into the court,--as he\nwould have done,--and had he then heard a verdict of guilty given by\nthe jury;--nay, had he heard such proof of her guilt as would have\nconvinced himself, it would have killed him. He felt, as he sat\nthere, safe over his own fireside, that his safety was due to her\ngenerosity. Had that other calamity fallen upon him, he could not\nhave survived it. His head would have fallen low before the eyes of\nthose who had known him since they had known anything, and would\nnever have been raised again. In his own spirit, in his inner life,\nthe blow had come to him; but it was due to her effort on his behalf\nthat he had not been stricken in public. When he had discussed the\nmatter with Mrs. Orme, he had seemed in a measure to forget this. It\nhad not at any rate been the thought which rested with the greatest\nweight upon his mind. Then he had considered how she, whose life had\nbeen stainless as driven snow, should bear herself in the presence of\nsuch deep guilt. But now,--now as he sat alone, he thought only of\nLady Mason. Let her be ever so guilty,--and her guilt had been very\nterrible,--she had behaved very nobly to him. From him at least she\nhad a right to sympathy.\n\nAnd what chance was there that she should escape? Of absolute escape\nthere was no chance whatever. Even should the jury acquit her, she\nmust declare her guilt to the world,--must declare it to her son,\nby taking steps for the restoration of the property. As to that Sir\nPeregrine felt no doubt whatever. That Joseph Mason of Groby would\nrecover his right to Orley Farm was to him a certainty. But how\nterrible would be the path over which she must walk before this\ndeed of retribution could be done! \"Ah, me! ah, me!\" he said, as\nhe thought of all this,--speaking to himself, as though he were\nunconscious of his grandson's presence. \"Poor woman! poor woman!\"\nThen Peregrine felt sure that she had been guilty, and was sure also\nthat his grandfather was aware of it.\n\n\"Will you come into the other room, sir?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, yes; if you like it.\" And then the one leg fell from the other,\nand he rose to do his grandson's bidding. To him now and henceforward\none room was much the same as another.\n\nIn the mean time the party bound for Orley Farm had reached that\nplace, and to them also came the necessity of wearing through that\ntedious evening. On the mind of Lucius Mason not even yet had a\nshadow of suspicion fallen. To him, in spite of it all, his mother\nwas still pure. But yet he was stern to her, and his manner was very\nharsh. It may be that had such suspicion crossed his mind he would\nhave been less stern, and his manner more tender. As it was he could\nunderstand nothing that was going on, and almost felt that he was\nkept in the dark at his mother's instance. Why was it that a man\nrespected by all the world, such as Sir Richard Leatherham, should\nrise in court and tell such a tale as that against his mother; and\nthat the power of answering that tale on his mother's behalf should\nbe left to such another man as Mr. Chaffanbrass? Sir Richard had told\nhis story plainly, but with terrible force; whereas Chaffanbrass had\ncontented himself with brow-beating another lawyer with the lowest\nquirks of his cunning. Why had not some one been in court able to use\nthe language of passionate truth and ready to thrust the lie down the\nthroats of those who told it?\n\nTea and supper had been prepared for them, and they sat down\ntogether; but the nature of the meal may be imagined. Lady Mason had\nstriven with terrible effort to support herself during the day, and\neven yet she did not give way. It was quite as necessary that she\nshould restrain herself before her son as before all those others\nwho had gazed at her in court. And she did sustain herself. She took\na knife and fork in her hand and ate a few morsels. She drank her\ncup of tea, and remembering that there in that house she was still\nhostess, she made some slight effort to welcome her guest. \"Surely\nafter such a day of trouble you will eat something,\" she said to her\nfriend. To Mrs. Orme it was marvellous that the woman should even\nbe alive,--let alone that she should speak and perform the ordinary\nfunctions of her daily life. \"And now,\" she said--Lady Mason said--as\nsoon as that ceremony was over, \"now as we are so tired I think we\nwill go up stairs. Will you light our candles for us, Lucius?\" And so\nthe candles were lit, and the two ladies went up stairs.\n\nA second bed had been prepared in Lady Mason's room, and into this\nchamber they both went at once. Mrs. Orme, as soon as she had\nentered, turned round and held out both her hands in order that she\nmight comfort Lady Mason by taking hers; but Lady Mason, when she had\nclosed the door, stood for a moment with her face towards the wall,\nnot knowing how to bear herself. It was but for a moment, and then\nslowly moving round, with her two hands clasped together, she sank on\nher knees at Mrs. Orme's feet, and hid her face in the skirt of Mrs.\nOrme's dress.\n\n\"My friend--my friend!\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"Yes, I am your friend--indeed I am. But, dear Lady Mason--\" And she\nendeavoured to think of words by which she might implore her to rise\nand compose herself.\n\n\"How is it you can bear with such a one as I am? How is it that you\ndo not hate me for my guilt?\"\n\n\"He does not hate us when we are guilty.\"\n\n\"I do not know. Sometimes I think that all will hate me,--here and\nhereafter--except you. Lucius will hate me, and how shall I bear\nthat? Oh, Mrs. Orme, I wish he knew it!\"\n\n\"I wish he did. He shall know it now,--to-night, if you will allow me\nto tell him.\"\n\n\"No. It would kill me to bear his looks. I wish he knew it, and was\naway, so that he might never look at me again.\"\n\n\"He too would forgive you if he knew it all.\"\n\n\"Forgive! How can he forgive?\" And as she spoke she rose again to her\nfeet, and her old manner came upon her. \"Do you think what it is that\nI have done for him? I,--his mother,--for my only child? And after\nthat, is it possible that he should forgive me?\"\n\n\"You meant him no harm.\"\n\n\"But I have ruined him before all the world. He is as proud as\nyour boy; and could he bear to think that his whole life would be\ndisgraced by his mother's crime?\"\n\n\"Had I been so unfortunate he would have forgiven me.\"\n\n\"We are speaking of what is impossible. It could not have been so.\nYour youth was different from mine.\"\n\n\"God has been very good to me, and not placed temptation in my\nway;--temptation, I mean, to great faults. But little faults require\nrepentance as much as great ones.\"\n\n\"But then repentance is easy; at any rate it is possible.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lady Mason, is it not possible for you?\"\n\n\"But I will not talk of that now. I will not hear you compare\nyourself with such a one as I am. Do you know I was thinking to-day\nthat my mind would fail me, and that I should be mad before this is\nover? How can I bear it? how can I bear it?\" And rising from her\nseat, she walked rapidly through the room, holding back her hair from\nher brows with both her hands.\n\n[Illustration: \"How can I bear it?\"]\n\nAnd how was she to bear it? The load on her back was too much for her\nshoulders. The burden with which she had laden herself was too heavy\nto be borne. Her power of endurance was very great. Her strength in\nsupporting the extreme bitterness of intense sorrow was wonderful.\nBut now she was taxed beyond her power. \"How am I to bear it?\" she\nsaid again, as still holding her hair between her fingers, she drew\nher hands back over her head.\n\n\"You do not know. You have not tried it. It is impossible,\" she said\nin her wildness, as Mrs. Orme endeavoured to teach her the only\nsource from whence consolation might be had. \"I do not believe in\nthe thief on the cross, unless it was that he had prepared himself\nfor that day by years of contrition. I know I shock you,\" she added,\nafter a while. \"I know that what I say will be dreadful to you. But\ninnocence will always be shocked by guilt. Go, go and leave me. It\nhas gone so far now that all is of no use.\" Then she threw herself on\nthe bed, and burst into a convulsive passion of tears.\n\nOnce again Mrs. Orme endeavoured to obtain permission from her to\nundertake that embassy to her son. Had Lady Mason acceded, or been\nnear acceding, Mrs. Orme's courage would probably have been greatly\nchecked. As it was she pressed it as though the task were one to be\nperformed without difficulty. Mrs. Orme was very anxious that Lucius\nshould not sit in the court throughout the trial. She felt that if he\ndid so the shock,--the shock which was inevitable,--must fall upon\nhim there; and than that she could conceive nothing more terrible.\nAnd then also she believed that if the secret were once made known\nto Lucius, and if he were for a time removed from his mother's side,\nthe poor woman might be brought to a calmer perception of her true\nposition. The strain would be lessened, and she would no longer feel\nthe necessity of exerting so terrible a control over her feelings.\n\n\"You have acknowledged that he must know it sooner or later,\" pleaded\nMrs. Orme.\n\n\"But this is not the time,--not now, during the trial. Had he known\nit before--\"\n\n\"It would keep him away from the court.\"\n\n\"Yes, and I should never see him again! What will he do when he hears\nit? Perhaps it would be better that he should go without seeing me.\"\n\n\"He would not do that.\"\n\n\"It would be better. If they take me to the prison, I will never see\nhim again. His eyes would kill me. Do you ever watch him and see the\npride that there is in his eye? He has never yet known what disgrace\nmeans; and now I, his mother, have brought him to this!\"\n\nIt was all in vain as far as that night was concerned. Lady Mason\nwould give no such permission. But Mrs. Orme did exact from her a\nkind of promise that Lucius should be told on the next evening, if it\nthen appeared, from what Mr. Aram should say, that the result of the\ntrial was likely to be against them.\n\nLucius Mason spent his evening alone; and though he had as yet heard\nnone of the truth, his mind was not at ease, nor was he happy at\nheart. Though he had no idea of his mother's guilt, he did conceive\nthat after this trial it would be impossible that they should remain\nat Orley Farm. His mother's intended marriage with Sir Peregrine, and\nthen the manner in which that engagement had been broken off; the\ncourse of the trial, and its celebrity; the enmity of Dockwrath; and\nlastly, his own inability to place himself on terms of friendship\nwith those people who were still his mother's nearest friends, made\nhim feel that in any event it would be well for them to change their\nresidence. What could life do for him there at Orley Farm, after all\nthat had passed? He had gone to Liverpool and bought guano, and now\nthe sacks were lying in his barn unopened. He had begun to drain, and\nthe ugly unfinished lines of earth were lying across his fields. He\nhad no further interest in it, and felt that he could no longer go to\nwork on that ground as though he were in truth its master.\n\nBut then, as he thought of his future hopes, his place of residence\nand coming life, there was one other beyond himself and his mother\nto whom his mind reverted. What would Sophia wish that he should\ndo?--his own Sophia,--she who had promised him that her heart should\nbe with his through all the troubles of this trial? Before he went\nto bed that night he wrote to Sophia, and told her what were his\ntroubles and what his hopes. \"This will be over in two days more,\"\nhe said, \"and then I will come to you. You will see me, I trust, the\nday after this letter reaches you; but nevertheless I cannot debar\nmyself from the satisfaction of writing. I am not happy, for I am\ndissatisfied with what they are doing for my mother; and it is only\nwhen I think of you, and the assurance of your love, that I can feel\nanything like content. It is not a pleasant thing to sit by and\nhear one's mother charged with the foulest frauds that practised\nvillains can conceive! Yet I have had to bear it, and have heard\nno denial of the charge in true honest language. To-day, when the\nsolicitor-general was heaping falsehoods on her name, I could hardly\nrefrain myself from rushing at his throat. Let me have a line of\ncomfort from you, and then I will be with you on Friday.\"\n\nThat line of comfort never came, nor did Lucius on the Friday make\nhis intended visit. Miss Furnival had determined, some day or two\nbefore this, that she would not write to Lucius again till this\ntrial was over; and even then it might be a question whether a\ncorrespondence with the heir of Noningsby would not be more to her\ntaste.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI.\n\nSHOWING HOW JOHN KENNEBY AND BRIDGET BOLSTER\nBORE THEMSELVES IN COURT.\n\n\nOn the next morning they were all in their places at ten o'clock,\nand the crowd had been gathered outside the doors of the court from\na much earlier hour. As the trial progressed the interest in it\nincreased, and as people began to believe that Lady Mason had in\ntruth forged a will, so did they the more regard her in the light of\na heroine. Had she murdered her husband after forging his will, men\nwould have paid half a crown apiece to have touched her garments, or\na guinea for the privilege of shaking hands with her. Lady Mason had\nagain taken her seat with her veil raised, with Mrs. Orme on one side\nof her and her son on the other. The counsel were again ranged on the\nseats behind, Mr. Furnival sitting the nearest to the judge, and Mr.\nAram again occupied the intermediate bench, so placing himself that\nhe could communicate either with his client or with the barristers.\nThese were now their established places, and great as was the crowd,\nthey found no difficulty in reaching them. An easy way is always made\nfor the chief performers in a play.\n\nThis was to be the great day as regarded the evidence. \"It is a\ncase that depends altogether on evidence,\" one young lawyer said to\nanother. \"If the counsel know how to handle the witnesses, I should\nsay she is safe.\" The importance of this handling was felt by every\none, and therefore it was understood that the real game would\nbe played out on this middle day. It had been all very well for\nChaffanbrass to bully Dockwrath and make the wretched attorney\nmiserable for an hour or so, but that would have but little bearing\non the verdict. There were two persons there who were prepared to\nswear that on a certain day they had only signed one deed. So much\nthe solicitor-general had told them, and nobody doubted that it\nwould be so. The question now was this, would Mr. Furnival and Mr.\nChaffanbrass succeed in making them contradict themselves when they\nhad so sworn? Could they be made to say that they had signed two\ndeeds, or that they might have done so?\n\nIt was again the duty of Mr. Furnival to come first upon the\nstage,--that is to say, he was to do so as soon as Sir Richard had\nperformed his very second-rate part of eliciting the evidence in\nchief. Poor John Kenneby was to be the first victim, and he was\nplaced in the box before them all very soon after the judge had\ntaken his seat. Why had he not emigrated to Australia, and escaped\nall this,--escaped all this, and Mrs. Smiley also? That was John\nKenneby's reflection as he slowly mounted the two steps up into\nthe place of his torture. Near to the same spot, and near also to\nDockwrath who had taken these two witnesses under his special charge,\nsat Bridget Bolster. She had made herself very comfortable that\nmorning with buttered toast and sausages; and when at Dockwrath's\ninstance Kenneby had submitted to a slight infusion of Dutch\ncourage,--a bottle of brandy would not have sufficed for the\npurpose,--Bridget also had not refused the generous glass. \"Not that\nI wants it,\" said she, meaning thereby to express an opinion that she\ncould hold her own, even against the great Chaffanbrass, without any\nsuch extraneous aid. She now sat quite quiet, with her hands crossed\non her knees before her, and her eyes immovably fixed on the table\nwhich stood in the centre of the court. In that position she remained\ntill her turn came; and one may say that there was no need for fear\non account of Bridget Bolster.\n\nAnd then Sir Richard began. What would be the nature of Kenneby's\ndirect evidence the reader pretty well knows. Sir Richard took a long\ntime in extracting it, for he was aware that it would be necessary\nto give his witness some confidence before he came to his main\nquestions. Even to do this was difficult, for Kenneby would speak in\na voice so low that nobody could hear him; and on the second occasion\nof the judge enjoining him to speak out, he nearly fainted. It is odd\nthat it never occurs to judges that a witness who is naturally timid\nwill be made more so by being scolded. When I hear a judge thus use\nhis authority, I always wish that I had the power of forcing him to\nsome very uncongenial employment,--jumping in a sack, let us say; and\nthen when he jumped poorly, as he certainly would, I would crack my\nwhip and bid him go higher and higher. The more I so bade him, the\nmore he would limp; and the world looking on, would pity him and\nexecrate me. It is much the same thing when a witness is sternly told\nto speak louder.\n\nBut John Kenneby at last told his plain story. He remembered the day\non which he had met old Usbech and Bridget Bolster and Lady Mason\nin Sir Joseph's chamber. He had then witnessed a signature by Sir\nJoseph, and had only witnessed one on that day;--of that he was\nperfectly certain. He did not think that old Usbech had signed the\ndeed in question, but on that matter he declined to swear positively.\nHe remembered the former trial. He had not then been able to swear\npositively whether Usbech had or had not signed the deed. As far as\nhe could remember, that was the point to which his cross-examination\non that occasion had chiefly been directed. So much John Kenneby did\nat last say in language that was sufficiently plain.\n\nAnd then Mr. Furnival arose. The reader is acquainted with the state\nof his mind on the subject of this trial. The enthusiasm on behalf of\nLady Mason, which had been aroused by his belief in her innocence, by\nhis old friendship, by his ancient adherence to her cause, and by his\nadmiration for her beauty, had now greatly faded. It had faded much\nwhen he found himself obliged to call in such fellow-labourers as\nChaffanbrass and Aram, and had all but perished when he learned from\ncontact with them to regard her guilt as certain. But, nevertheless,\nnow that he was there, the old fire returned to him. He had wished\ntwenty times that he had been able to shake the matter from him and\nleave his old client in the hands of her new advisers. It would be\nbetter for her, he had said to himself. But on this day--on these\nthree days--seeing that he had not shaken the matter off, he rose to\nhis work as though he still loved her, as though all his mind was\nstill intent on preserving that ill-gotten inheritance for her son.\nIt may almost be doubted whether at moments during these three days\nhe did not again persuade himself that she was an injured woman.\nAram, as may be remembered, had felt misgivings as to Mr. Furnival's\npowers for such cross-examination; but Chaffanbrass had never doubted\nit. He knew that Mr. Furnival could do as much as himself in that\nway; the difference being this,--that Mr. Furnival could do something\nelse besides.\n\n\"And now, Mr. Kenneby, I'll ask you a few questions,\" he said; and\nKenneby turned round to him. The barrister spoke in a mild low voice,\nbut his eye transfixed the poor fellow at once; and though Kenneby\nwas told a dozen times to look at the jury and speak to the jury, he\nnever was able to take his gaze away from Mr. Furnival's face.\n\n\"You remember the old trial,\" he said; and as he spoke he held in his\nhand what was known to be an account of that transaction. Then there\narose a debate between him and Sir Richard, in which Chaffanbrass,\nand Graham, and Mr. Steelyard all took part, as to whether Kenneby\nmight be examined as to his former examination; and on this point\nGraham pleaded very volubly, bringing up precedents without\nnumber,--striving to do his duty to his client on a point with which\nhis own conscience did not interfere. And at last it was ruled by the\njudge that this examination might go on;--whereupon both Sir Richard\nand Mr. Steelyard sat down as though they were perfectly satisfied.\nKenneby, on being again asked, said that he did remember the old\ntrial.\n\n\"It is necessary, you know, that the jury should hear you, and if you\nlook at them and speak to them, they would stand a better chance.\"\nKenneby for a moment allowed his eye to travel up to the jury box,\nbut it instantly fell again, and fixed itself on the lawyer's face.\n\"You do remember that trial?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, I remember it,\" whispered Kenneby.\n\n\"Do you remember my asking you then whether you had been in the habit\nof witnessing Sir Joseph Mason's signature?\"\n\n\"Did you ask me that, sir?\"\n\n\"That is the question which I put to you. Do you remember my doing\nso?\"\n\n\"I dare say you did, sir.\"\n\n\"I did, and I will now read your answer. We shall give to the jury a\ncopy of the proceedings of that trial, my lord, when we have proved\nit,--as of course we intend to do.\"\n\nAnd then there was another little battle between the barristers. But\nas Lady Mason was now being tried for perjury, alleged to have been\ncommitted at that other trial, it was of course indispensable that\nall the proceedings of that trial should be made known to the jury.\n\n\"You said on that occasion,\" continued Furnival, \"that you were sure\nyou had witnessed three signatures of Sir Joseph's that summer,--that\nyou had probably witnessed three in July, that you were quite sure\nyou had witnessed three in one week in July, that you were nearly\nsure you had witnessed three in one day, that you could not tell what\nday that might have been, and that you had been used as a witness so\noften that you really did not remember anything about it. Can you say\nwhether that was the purport of the evidence you gave then?\"\n\n\"If it's down there--\" said John Kenneby, and then he stopped\nhimself.\n\n\"It is down here; I have read it.\"\n\n\"I suppose it's all right,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"I must trouble you to speak out,\" said the judge; \"I cannot hear\nyou, and it is impossible that the jury should do so.\" The judge's\nwords were not uncivil, but his voice was harsh, and the only\nperceptible consequence of the remonstrance was to be seen in the\nthick drops of perspiration standing on John Kenneby's brow.\n\n\"That is the evidence which you gave on the former trial? May the\njury presume that you then spoke the truth to the best of your\nknowledge?\"\n\n\"I tried to speak the truth, sir.\"\n\n\"You tried to speak the truth? But do you mean to say that you\nfailed?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think I failed.\"\n\n\"When, therefore, you told the jury that you were nearly sure that\nyou had witnessed three signatures of Sir Joseph's in one day, that\nwas truth?\"\n\n\"I don't think I ever did.\"\n\n\"Ever did what?\"\n\n\"Witness three papers in one day.\"\n\n\"You don't think you ever did?\"\n\n\"I might have done, to be sure.\"\n\n\"But then, at that trial, about twelve months after the man's death,\nyou were nearly sure you had done so.\"\n\n\"Was I?\"\n\n\"So you told the jury.\"\n\n\"Then I did, sir.\"\n\n\"Then you did what?\"\n\n\"Did witness all those papers.\"\n\n\"You think then now that it is probable you witnessed three\nsignatures on the same day?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think that.\"\n\n\"Then what do you think?\"\n\n\"It is so long ago, sir, that I really don't know.\"\n\n\"Exactly. It is so long ago that you cannot depend on your memory.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can't, sir.\"\n\n\"But you just now told the gentleman who examined you on the other\nside, that you were quite sure you did not witness two deeds on the\nday he named,--the 14th of July. Now, seeing that you doubt your own\nmemory, going back over so long a time, do you wish to correct that\nstatement?\"\n\n\"I suppose I do.\"\n\n\"What correction do you wish to make?\"\n\n\"I don't think I did.\"\n\n\"Don't think you did what?\"\n\n\"I don't think I signed two--\"\n\n\"I really cannot hear the witness,\" said the judge\n\n\"You must speak out louder,\" said Mr. Furnival, himself speaking very\nloudly.\n\n\"I mean to do it as well as I can,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"I believe you do,\" said Furnival; \"but in so meaning you must be\nvery careful to state nothing as a certainty, of the certainty of\nwhich you are not sure. Are you certain that on that day you did not\nwitness two deeds?\"\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"And yet you were not certain twenty years ago, when the fact was so\nmuch nearer to you?\"\n\n\"I don't remember.\"\n\n\"You don't remember whether you were certain twelve months after the\noccurrence, but you think you are certain now.\"\n\n\"I mean, I don't think I signed two.\"\n\n\"It is, then, only a matter of thinking?\"\n\n\"No;--only a matter of thinking.\"\n\n\"And you might have signed the two?\"\n\n\"I certainly might have done so.\"\n\n\"What you mean to tell the jury is this: that you have no remembrance\nof signing twice on that special day, although you know that you have\nacted as witness on behalf of Sir Joseph Mason more than twice on the\nsame day?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That is the intended purport of your evidence?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\nAnd then Mr. Furnival travelled off to that other point of Mr.\nUsbech's presence and alleged handwriting. On that matter Kenneby\nhad not made any positive assertion, though he had expressed a very\nstrong opinion. Mr. Furnival was not satisfied with this, but wished\nto show that Kenneby had not on that matter even a strong opinion. He\nagain reverted to the evidence on the former trial, and read various\nquestions with their answers; and the answers as given at that time\ncertainly did not, when so taken, express a clear opinion on the part\nof the person who gave them; although an impartial person on reading\nthe whole evidence would have found that a very clear opinion was\nexpressed. When first asked, Kenneby had said that he was nearly sure\nthat Mr. Usbech had not signed the document. But his very anxiety to\nbe true had brought him into trouble. Mr. Furnival on that occasion\nhad taken advantage of the word \"nearly,\" and had at last succeeded\nin making him say that he was not sure at all. Evidence by means\nof torture,--thumbscrew and suchlike,--we have for many years past\nabandoned as barbarous, and have acknowledged that it is of its very\nnature useless in the search after truth. How long will it be before\nwe shall recognise that the other kind of torture is equally opposed\nboth to truth and civilization?\n\n\"But Mr. Usbech was certainly in the room on that day?\" continued Mr.\nFurnival.\n\n\"Yes, he was there.\"\n\n\"And knew what you were all doing, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose he knew.\"\n\n\"I presume it was he who explained to you the nature of the deed you\nwere to witness?\"\n\n\"I dare say he did.\"\n\n\"As he was the lawyer, that would be natural.\"\n\n\"I suppose it would.\"\n\n\"And you don't remember the nature of that special deed, as explained\nto you on the day when Bridget Bolster was in the room?\"\n\n\"No, I don't.\"\n\n\"It might have been a will?\"\n\n\"Yes, it might. I did sign one or two wills for Sir Joseph, I think.\"\n\n\"And as to this individual document, Mr. Usbech might have signed it\nin your presence, for anything you know to the contrary?\"\n\n\"He might have done so.\"\n\n\"Now, on your oath, Kenneby, is your memory strong enough to enable\nyou to give the jury any information on this subject upon which they\nmay firmly rely in convicting that unfortunate lady of the terrible\ncrime laid to her charge.\" Then for a moment Kenneby glanced round\nand fixed his eyes upon Lady Mason's face. \"Think a moment before\nyou answer; and deal with her as you would wish another should deal\nwith you if you were so situated. Can you say that you remember that\nUsbech did not sign it?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I don't think he did.\"\n\n\"But he might have done so?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; he might.\"\n\n\"You do not remember that he did do so?\"\n\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\n\"And that is about the extent of what you mean to say?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Let me understand,\" said the judge--and then the perspiration became\nmore visible on poor Kenneby's face;--\"do you mean to say that you\nhave no memory on the matter whatever?--that you simply do not\nremember whether Usbech did or did not sign it?\"\n\n\"I don't think he signed it.\"\n\n\"But why do you think he did not, seeing that his name is there?\"\n\n\"I didn't see him.\"\n\n\"Do you mean,\" continued the judge, \"that you didn't see him, or that\nyou don't remember that you saw him?\"\n\n\"I don't remember that I saw him.\"\n\n\"But you may have done so? He may have signed, and you may have seen\nhim do so, only you don't remember it?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord.\"\n\nAnd then Kenneby was allowed to go down. As he did so, Joseph Mason,\nwho sat near to him, turned upon him a look black as thunder. Mr.\nMason gave him no credit for his timidity, but believed that he had\nbeen bought over by the other side. Dockwrath, however, knew better.\n\"They did not quite beat him about his own signature,\" said he; \"but\nI knew all along that we must depend chiefly upon Bolster.\"\n\nThen Bridget Bolster was put into the box, and she was examined by\nMr. Steelyard. She had heard Kenneby instructed to look up, and she\ntherefore fixed her eyes upon the canopy over the judge's seat. There\nshe fixed them, and there she kept them till her examination was\nover, merely turning them for a moment on to Mr. Chaffanbrass, when\nthat gentleman became particularly severe in his treatment of her.\nWhat she said in answer to Mr. Steelyard, was very simple. She had\nnever witnessed but one signature in her life, and that she had done\nin Sir Joseph's room. The nature of the document had been explained\nto her. \"But,\" as she said, \"she was young and giddy then, and what\nwent in at one ear went out at another.\" She didn't remember Mr.\nUsbech signing, but he might have done so. She thought he did not. As\nto the two signatures purporting to be hers, she could not say which\nwas hers and which was not. But this she would swear positively,\nthat they were not both hers. To this she adhered firmly, and Mr.\nSteelyard handed her over to Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n[Illustration: Bridget Bolster in Court.]\n\nThen Mr. Chaffanbrass rose from his seat, and every one knew that his\nwork was cut out for him. Mr. Furnival had triumphed. It may be said\nthat he had demolished his witness; but his triumph had been very\neasy. It was now necessary to demolish Bridget Bolster, and the\nopinion was general that if anybody could do it Mr. Chaffanbrass\nwas the man. But there was a doggedness about Bridget Bolster which\ninduced many to doubt whether even Chaffanbrass would be successful.\nMr. Aram trusted greatly; but the bar would have preferred to stake\ntheir money on Bridget.\n\nChaffanbrass as he rose pushed back his small ugly wig from his\nforehead, thrusting it rather on one side as he did so, and then,\nwith his chin thrown forward, and a wicked, ill-meaning smile upon\nhis mouth, he looked at Bridget for some moments before he spoke to\nher. She glanced at him, and instantly fixed her eyes back upon the\ncanopy. She then folded her hands one on the other upon the rail\nbefore her, compressed her lips, and waited patiently.\n\n\"I think you say you're--a chambermaid?\" That was the first question\nwhich Chaffanbrass asked, and Bridget Bolster gave a little start as\nshe heard his sharp, angry, disagreeable voice.\n\n\"Yes, I am, sir, at Palmer's Imperial Hotel, Plymouth, Devonshire;\nand have been for nineteen years, upper and under.\"\n\n\"Upper and under! What do upper and under mean?\"\n\n\"When I was under, I had another above me; and now, as I'm upper, why\nthere's others under me.\" So she explained her position at the hotel,\nbut she never took her eyes from the canopy.\n\n\"You hadn't begun being--chambermaid, when you signed these\ndocuments?\"\n\n\"I didn't sign only one of 'em.\"\n\n\"Well, one of them. You hadn't begun being chambermaid then?\"\n\n\"No, I hadn't; I was housemaid at Orley Farm.\"\n\n\"Were you upper or under there?\"\n\n\"Well, I believe I was both; that is, the cook was upper in the\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Oh, the cook was upper. Why wasn't she called to sign her name?\"\n\n\"That I can't say. She was a very decent woman,--that I can say,--and\nher name was Martha Mullens.\"\n\nSo far Mr. Chaffanbrass had not done much; but that was only the\npreliminary skirmish, as fencers play with their foils before they\nbegin.\n\n\"And now, Bridget Bolster, if I understand you,\" he said, \"you\nhave sworn that on the 14th of July you only signed one of these\ndocuments.\"\n\n\"I only signed once, sir. I didn't say nothing about the 14th of\nJuly, because I don't remember.\"\n\n\"But when you signed the one deed, you did not sign any other?\"\n\n\"Neither then nor never.\"\n\n\"Do you know the offence for which that lady is being tried--Lady\nMason?\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't sure; it's for doing something about the will.\"\n\n\"No, woman, it is not.\" And then, as Mr. Chaffanbrass raised his\nvoice, and spoke with savage earnestness, Bridget again started, and\ngave a little leap up from the floor. But she soon settled herself\nback in her old position. \"No one has dared to accuse her of that,\"\ncontinued Mr. Chaffanbrass, looking over at the lawyers on the other\nside. \"The charge they have brought forward against her is that of\nperjury--of having given false evidence twenty years ago in a court\nof law. Now look here, Bridget Bolster; look at me, I say.\" She\ndid look at him for a moment, and then turned her eyes back to the\ncanopy. \"As sure as you're a living woman, you shall be placed there\nand tried for the same offence,--for perjury,--if you tell me a\nfalsehood respecting this matter.\"\n\n\"I won't say nothing but what's right,\" said Bridget.\n\n\"You had better not. Now look at these two signatures;\" and he handed\nto her two deeds, or rather made one of the servants of the court\nhold them for him; \"which of those signatures is the one which you\ndid not sign?\"\n\n\"I can't say, sir.\"\n\n\"Did you write that further one,--that with your hand on it?\"\n\n\"I can't say, sir.\"\n\n\"Look at it, woman, before you answer me.\"\n\nBridget looked at it, and then repeated the same words--\n\n\"I can't say, sir.\"\n\n\"And now look at the other.\" And she again looked down for a moment.\n\"Did you write that?\"\n\n\"I can't say, sir.\"\n\n\"Will you swear that you wrote either?\"\n\n\"I did write one once.\"\n\n\"Don't prevaricate with me, woman. Were either of those signatures\nthere written by you?\"\n\n\"I suppose that one was.\"\n\n\"Will you swear that you wrote either the one or the other?\"\n\n\"I'll swear I did write one, once.\"\n\n\"Will you swear you wrote one of those you have before you? You can\nread, can't you?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I can read.\"\n\n\"Then look at them.\" Again she turned her eyes on them for half a\nmoment. \"Will you swear that you wrote either of those?\"\n\n\"Not if there's another anywhere else,\" said Bridget, at last.\n\n\"Another anywhere else,\" said Chaffanbrass, repeating her words;\n\"what do you mean by another?\"\n\n\"If you've got another that anybody else has done, I won't say which\nof the three is mine. But I did one, and I didn't do no more.\"\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass continued at it for a long time, but with very\nindifferent success. That affair of the signatures, which was\nindeed the only point on which evidence was worth anything, he then\nabandoned, and tried to make her contradict herself about old Usbech.\nBut on this subject she could say nothing. That Usbech was present\nshe remembered well, but as to his signing the deed, or not signing\nit, she would not pretend to say anything.\n\n\"I know he was cram full of gout,\" she said; \"but I don't remember\nnothing more.\"\n\nBut it may be explained that Mr. Chaffanbrass had altogether altered\nhis intention and the very plan of his campaign with reference to\nthis witness, as soon as he saw what was her nature and disposition.\nHe discovered very early in the affair that he could not force her\nto contradict herself and reduce her own evidence to nothing, as\nFurnival had done with the man. Nothing would flurry this woman,\nor force her to utter words of which she herself did not know the\nmeaning. The more he might persevere in such an attempt, the more\ndogged and steady she would become. He therefore soon gave that\nup. He had already given it up when he threatened to accuse her of\nperjury, and resolved that as he could not shake her he would shake\nthe confidence which the jury might place in her. He could not make a\nfool of her, and therefore he would make her out to be a rogue. Her\nevidence would stand alone, or nearly alone; and in this way he might\nturn her firmness to his own purpose, and explain that her dogged\nresolution to stick to one plain statement arose from her having been\nspecially instructed so to do, with the object of ruining his client.\nFor more than half an hour he persisted in asking her questions with\nthis object; hinting that she was on friendly terms with Dockwrath;\nasking her what pay she had received for her evidence; making her\nacknowledge that she was being kept at free quarters, and on the fat\nof the land. He even produced from her a list of the good things\nshe had eaten that morning at breakfast, and at last succeeded\nin obtaining information as to that small but indiscreet glass\nof spirits. It was then, and then only, that poor Bridget became\ndiscomposed. Beefsteaks, sausages, and pigs' fry, though they were\ntaken three times a day, were not disgraceful in her line of life;\nbut that little thimble of brandy, taken after much pressing and in\nthe openness of good fellowship, went sorely against the grain with\nher. \"When one has to be badgered like this, one wants a drop of\nsomething more than ordinary,\" she said at last. And they were the\nonly words which she did say which proved any triumph on the part\nof Mr. Chaffanbrass. But nevertheless Mr. Chaffanbrass was not\ndissatisfied. Triumph, immediate triumph over a poor maid-servant\ncould hardly have been the object of a man who had been triumphant in\nsuch matters for the last thirty years. Would it not be practicable\nto make the jury doubt whether that woman could be believed? That was\nthe triumph he desired. As for himself, Mr. Chaffanbrass knew well\nenough that she had spoken nothing but the truth. But had he so\nmanaged that the truth might be made to look like falsehood,--or\nat any rate to have a doubtful air? If he had done that, he had\nsucceeded in the occupation of his life, and was indifferent to his\nown triumph.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII.\n\nMR. FURNIVAL'S SPEECH.\n\n\nAll this as may be supposed disturbed Felix Graham not a little. He\nperceived that each of those two witnesses had made a great effort to\nspeak the truth;--an honest, painful effort to speak the truth, and\nin no way to go beyond it. His gall had risen within him while he had\nlistened to Mr. Furnival, and witnessed his success in destroying the\npresence of mind of that weak wretch who was endeavouring to do his\nbest in the cause of justice. And again, when Mr. Chaffanbrass had\nseized hold of that poor dram, and used all his wit in deducing from\nit a self-condemnation from the woman before him;--when the practised\nbarrister had striven to show that she was an habitual drunkard,\ndishonest, unchaste, evil in all her habits, Graham had felt almost\ntempted to get up and take her part. No doubt he had evinced this,\nfor Chaffanbrass had understood what was going on in his colleague's\nmind, and had looked round at him from time to time with an air of\nscorn that had been almost unendurable.\n\nAnd then it had become the duty of the prosecutors to prove the\ncircumstances of the former trial. This was of course essentially\nnecessary, seeing that the offence for which Lady Mason was now on\nher defence was perjury alleged to have been committed at that trial.\nAnd when this had been done at considerable length by Sir Richard\nLeatherham,--not without many interruptions from Mr. Furnival and\nmuch assistance from Mr. Steelyard,--it fell upon Felix Graham to\nshow by cross-examination of Crook the attorney, what had been the\nnature and effect of Lady Mason's testimony. As he arose to do this,\nMr. Chaffanbrass whispered into his ear, \"If you feel yourself\nunequal to it I'll take it up. I won't have her thrown over for any\netiquette,--nor yet for any squeamishness.\" To this Graham vouchsafed\nno answer. He would not even reply by a look, but he got up and did\nhis work. At this point his conscience did not interfere with him,\nfor the questions which he asked referred to facts which had really\noccurred. Lady Mason's testimony at that trial had been believed by\neverybody. The gentleman who had cross-examined her on the part of\nJoseph Mason, and who was now dead, had failed to shake her evidence.\nThe judge who tried the case had declared to the jury that it was\nimpossible to disbelieve her evidence. That judge was still living,\na poor old bedridden man, and in the course of this latter trial his\nstatement was given in evidence. There could be no doubt that at the\ntime Lady Mason's testimony was taken as worthy of all credit. She\nhad sworn that she had seen the three witnesses sign the codicil, and\nno one had then thrown discredit on her. The upshot of all was this,\nthat the prosecuting side proved satisfactorily that such and such\nthings had been sworn by Lady Mason; and Felix Graham on the side of\nthe defence proved that, when she had so sworn, her word had been\nconsidered worthy of credence by the judge and by the jury, and had\nhardly been doubted even by the counsel opposed to her. All this\nreally had been so, and Felix Graham used his utmost ingenuity in\nmaking clear to the court how high and unassailed had been the\nposition which his client then held.\n\nAll this occupied the court till nearly four o'clock, and then as\nthe case was over on the part of the prosecution, the question arose\nwhether or no Mr. Furnival should address the jury on that evening,\nor wait till the following day. \"If your lordship will sit till seven\no'clock,\" said Mr. Furnival, \"I think I can undertake to finish\nwhat remarks I shall have to make by that time.\" \"I should not mind\nsitting till nine for the pleasure of hearing Mr. Furnival,\" said the\njudge, who was very anxious to escape from Alston on the day but one\nfollowing. And thus it was decided that Mr. Furnival should commence\nhis speech.\n\nI have said that in spite of some previous hesitation his old fire\nhad returned to him when he began his work in court on behalf of\nhis client. If this had been so when that work consisted in the\ncross-examination of a witness, it was much more so with him now when\nhe had to exhibit his own powers of forensic eloquence. When a man\nknows that he can speak with ease and energy, and that he will be\nlistened to with attentive ears, it is all but impossible that he\nshould fail to be enthusiastic, even though his cause be a bad one.\nIt was so with him now. All his old fire came back upon him, and\nbefore he had done he had almost brought himself again to believe\nLady Mason to be that victim of persecution as which he did not\nhesitate to represent her to the jury.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury,\" he said, \"I never rose to plead a client's\ncause with more confidence than I now feel in pleading that of my\nfriend Lady Mason. Twenty years ago I was engaged in defending her\nrights in this matter, and I then succeeded. I little thought at that\ntime that I should be called on after so long an interval to renew\nmy work. I little thought that the pertinacity of her opponent would\nhold out for such a period. I compliment him on the firmness of his\ncharacter, on that equable temperament which has enabled him to sit\nthrough all this trial, and to look without dismay on the unfortunate\nlady whom he has considered it to be his duty to accuse of perjury. I\ndid not think that I should live to fight this battle again. But so\nit is; and as I had but little doubt of victory then,--so have I none\nnow. Gentlemen of the jury, I must occupy some of your time and of\nthe time of the court in going through the evidence which has been\nadduced by my learned friend against my client; but I almost feel\nthat I shall be detaining you unnecessarily, so sure I am that the\ncircumstances, as they have been already explained to you, could not\njustify you in giving a verdict against her.\"\n\nAs Mr. Furnival's speech occupied fully three hours, I will not\ntrouble my readers with the whole of it. He began by describing the\nformer trial, and giving his own recollections as to Lady Mason's\nconduct on that occasion. In doing this, he fully acknowledged on her\nbehalf that she did give as evidence that special statement which her\nopponents now endeavoured to prove to have been false. \"If it were\nthe case,\" he said, \"that that codicil--or that pretended codicil,\nwas not executed by old Sir Joseph Mason, and was not witnessed by\nUsbech, Kenneby, and Bridget Bolster,--then, in that case, Lady\nMason has been guilty of perjury.\" Mr. Furnival, as he made this\nacknowledgement, studiously avoided the face of Lady Mason. But as\nhe made this assertion, almost everybody in the court except her own\ncounsel did look at her. Joseph Mason opposite and Dockwrath fixed\ntheir gaze closely upon her. Sir Richard Leatherham and Mr. Steelyard\nturned their eyes towards her, probably without meaning to do so.\nThe judge looked over his spectacles at her. Even Mr. Aram glanced\nround at her surreptitiously; and Lucius turned his face upon his\nmother's, almost with an air of triumph. But she bore it all without\nflinching;--bore it all without flinching, though the state of her\nmind at that moment must have been pitiable. And Mrs. Orme, who held\nher hand all the while, knew that it was so. The hand which rested in\nhers was twitched as it were convulsively, but the culprit gave no\noutward sign of her guilt.\n\nMr. Furnival then read much of the evidence given at the former\ntrial, and especially showed how the witnesses had then failed to\nprove that Usbech had not been required to write his name. It was\nquite true, he said, that they had been equally unable to prove that\nhe had done so; but that amounted to nothing; the \"onus probandi\" lay\nwith the accusing side. There was the signature, and it was for them\nto prove that it was not that which it pretended to be. Lady Mason\nhad proved that it was so; and because that had then been held to\nbe sufficient, they now, after twenty years, took this means of\ninvalidating her testimony. From that he went to the evidence given\nat the present trial, beginning with the malice and interested\nmotives of Dockwrath. Against three of them only was it needful that\nhe should allege anything, seeing that the statements made by the\nothers were in no way injurious to Lady Mason,--if the statements\nmade by those three were not credible. Torrington, for instance, had\nproved that other deed; but what of that, if on the fatal 14th of\nJuly Sir Joseph Mason had executed two deeds? As to Dockwrath,--that\nhis conduct had been interested and malicious there could be no\ndoubt; and he submitted to the jury that he had shown himself to be a\nman unworthy of credit. As to Kenneby,--that poor weak creature, as\nMr. Furnival in his mercy called him,--he, Mr. Furnival, could not\ncharge his conscience with saying that he believed him to have been\nguilty of any falsehood. On the contrary, he conceived that Kenneby\nhad endeavoured to tell the truth. But he was one of those men whose\nminds were so inconsequential that they literally did not know truth\nfrom falsehood. He had not intended to lie when he told the jury\nthat he was not quite sure he had never witnessed two signatures by\nSir Joseph Mason on the same day, nor did he lie when he told them\nagain that he had witnessed three. He had meant to declare the truth;\nbut he was, unfortunately, a man whose evidence could not be of\nmuch service in any case of importance, and could be of no service\nwhatever in a criminal charge tried, as was done in this instance,\nmore than twenty years after the alleged commission of the offence.\nWith regard to Bridget Bolster, he had no hesitation whatever in\ntelling the jury that she was a woman unworthy of belief,--unworthy\nof that credit which the jury must place in her before they could\nconvict any one on her unaided testimony. It must have been clear to\nthem all that she had come into court drilled and instructed to make\none point-blank statement, and to stick to that. She had refused to\ngive any evidence as to her own signature. She would not even look at\nher own name as written by herself; but had contented herself with\nrepeating over and over again those few words which she had been\ninstructed so to say;--the statement namely, that she had never put\nher hand to more than one deed.\n\nThen he addressed himself, as he concluded his speech, to that part\nof the subject which was more closely personal to Lady Mason herself.\n\"And now, gentlemen of the jury,\" he said, \"before I can dismiss you\nfrom your weary day's work, I must ask you to regard the position of\nthe lady who has been thus accused, and the amount of probability of\nher guilt which you may assume from the nature of her life. I shall\ncall no witnesses as to her character, for I will not submit her\nfriends to the annoyance of those questions which the gentlemen\nopposite might feel it their duty to put to them. Circumstances\nhave occurred--so much I will tell you, and so much no doubt\nyou all personally know, though it is not in evidence before\nyou;--circumstances have occurred which would make it cruel on my\npart to place her old friend Sir Peregrine Orme in that box. The\nstory, could I tell it to you, is one full of romance, but full also\nof truth and affection. But though Sir Peregrine Orme is not here,\nthere sits his daughter by Lady Mason's side,--there she has sat\nthrough this tedious trial, giving comfort to the woman that she\nloves,--and there she will sit till your verdict shall have made\nher further presence here unnecessary. His lordship and my learned\nfriend there will tell you that you cannot take that as evidence of\ncharacter. They will be justified in so telling you; but I, on the\nother hand, defy you not to take it as such evidence. Let us make\nwhat laws we will, they cannot take precedence of human nature. There\ntoo sits my client's son. You will remember that at the beginning of\nthis trial the solicitor-general expressed a wish that he were not\nhere. I do not know whether you then responded to that wish, but I\nbelieve I may take it for granted that you do not do so now. Had any\nwoman dear to either of you been so placed through the malice of an\nenemy, would you have hesitated to sit by her in her hour of trial?\nHad you doubted of her innocence you might have hesitated; for who\ncould endure to hear announced in a crowded court like this the guilt\nof a mother or a wife? But he has no doubt. Nor, I believe, has any\nliving being in this court,--unless it be her kinsman opposite, whose\nlife for the last twenty years has been made wretched by a wicked\nlonging after the patrimony of his brother.\n\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, there sits my client with as loving a friend\non one side as ever woman had, and with her only child on the other.\nDuring the incidents of this trial the nature of the life she has\nled during the last twenty years,--since the period of that terrible\ncrime with which she is charged,--has been proved before you. I may\nfearlessly ask you whether so fair a life is compatible with the\nidea of guilt so foul? I have known her intimately during all those\nyears,--not as a lawyer, but as a friend,--and I confess that the\naudacity of this man Dockwrath, in assailing such a character\nwith such an accusation, strikes me almost with admiration. What!\nForgery!--for that, gentlemen of the jury, is the crime with which\nshe is substantially charged. Look at her, as she sits there! That\nshe, at the age of twenty, or not much more,--she who had so well\nperformed the duties of her young life, that she should have forged\na will,--have traced one signature after another in such a manner as\nto have deceived all those lawyers who were on her track immediately\nafter her husband's death! For, mark you, if this be true, with\nher own hand she must have done it! There was no accomplice there.\nLook at her! Was she a forger? Was she a woman to deceive the sharp\nbloodhounds of the law? Could she, with that young baby on her bosom,\nhave wrested from such as him\"--and as he spoke he pointed with his\nfinger, but with a look of unutterable scorn, to Joseph Mason, who\nwas sitting opposite to him--\"that fragment of his old father's\nproperty which he coveted so sorely? Where had she learned such\nskilled artifice? Gentlemen, such ingenuity in crime as that has\nnever yet been proved in a court of law, even against those who have\nspent a life of wretchedness in acquiring such skill; and now you are\nasked to believe that such a deed was done by a young wife, of whom\nall that you know is that her conduct in every other respect had been\nbeyond all praise! Gentlemen, I might have defied you to believe\nthis accusation had it even been supported by testimony of a high\ncharacter. Even in such case you would have felt that there was more\nbehind than had been brought to your knowledge. But now, having seen,\nas you have, of what nature are the witnesses on whose testimony she\nhas been impeached, it is impossible that you should believe this\nstory. Had Lady Mason been a woman steeped in guilt from her infancy,\nhad she been noted for cunning and fraudulent ingenuity, had she been\nknown as an expert forger, you would not have convicted her on this\nindictment, having had before you the malice and greed of Dockwrath,\nthe stupidity--I may almost call it idiocy, of Kenneby, and the\ndogged resolution to conceal the truth evinced by the woman Bolster.\nWith strong evidence you could not have believed such a charge\nagainst so excellent a lady. With such evidence as you have had\nbefore you, you could not have believed the charge against a\npreviously convicted felon.\n\n\"And what has been the object of this terrible persecution,--of the\ndreadful punishment which has been inflicted on this poor lady? For\nremember, though you cannot pronounce her guilty, her sufferings have\nbeen terribly severe. Think what it must have been for a woman with\nhabits such as hers, to have looked forward for long, long weeks\nto such a martyrdom as this! Think what she must have suffered in\nbeing dragged here and subjected to the gaze of all the county as a\nsuspected felon! Think what must have been her feelings when I told\nher, not knowing how deep an ingenuity might be practised against\nher, that I must counsel her to call to her aid the unequalled\ntalents of my friend Mr. Chaffanbrass\"--\"Unequalled no longer, but\nfar surpassed,\" whispered Chaffanbrass, in a voice that was audible\nthrough all the centre of the court. \"Her punishment has been\nterrible,\" continued Mr. Furnival. \"After what she has gone through,\nit may well be doubted whether she can continue to reside at that\nsweet spot which has aroused such a feeling of avarice in the bosom\nof her kinsman. You have heard that Sir Joseph Mason had promised his\neldest son that Orley Farm should form a part of his inheritance. It\nmay be that the old man did make such a promise. If so, he thought\nfit to break it. But is it not wonderful that a man wealthy as is Mr.\nMason--for his fortune is large; who has never wanted anything that\nmoney can buy; a man for whom his father did so much,--that he should\nbe stirred up by disappointed avarice to carry in his bosom for\ntwenty years so bitter a feeling of rancour against those who are\nnearest to him by blood and ties of family! Gentlemen, it has been\na fearful lesson; but it is one which neither you nor I will ever\nforget!\n\n\"And now I shall leave my client's case in your hands. As to the\nverdict which you will give, I have no apprehension. You know as well\nas I do that she has not been guilty of this terrible crime. That\nyou will so pronounce I do not for a moment doubt. But I do hope\nthat that verdict will be accompanied by some expression on your\npart which may show to the world at large how great has been the\nwickedness displayed in the accusation.\"\n\nAnd yet as he sat down he knew that she had been guilty! To his ear\nher guilt had never been confessed; but yet he knew that it was so,\nand, knowing that, he had been able to speak as though her innocence\nwere a thing of course. That those witnesses had spoken truth he also\nknew, and yet he had been able to hold them up to the execration of\nall around them as though they had committed the worst of crimes from\nthe foulest of motives! And more than this, stranger than this, worse\nthan this,--when the legal world knew--as the legal world soon did\nknow--that all this had been so, the legal world found no fault with\nMr. Furnival, conceiving that he had done his duty by his client in a\nmanner becoming an English barrister and an English gentleman.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\n\nMRS. ORME TELLS THE STORY.\n\n\nIt was late when that second day's work was over, and when Mrs. Orme\nand Lady Mason again found themselves in the Hamworth carriage. They\nhad sat in court from ten in the morning till past seven, with a\nshort interval of a few minutes in the middle of the day, and were\nweary to the very soul when they left it. Lucius again led out his\nmother, and as he did so he expressed to her in strong language his\napproval of Mr. Furnival's speech. At last some one had spoken out on\nhis mother's behalf in that tone which should have been used from the\nfirst. He had been very angry with Mr. Furnival, thinking that the\nbarrister had lost sight of his mother's honour, and that he was\nplaying with her happiness. But now he was inclined to forgive him.\nNow at last the truth had been spoken in eloquent words, and the\npersecutors of his mother had been addressed in language such as it\nwas fitting that they should hear. To him the last two hours had been\ntwo hours of triumph, and as he passed through the hall of the court\nhe whispered in his mother's ear that now, at last, as he hoped, her\ntroubles were at an end.\n\nAnd another whisper had been spoken as they passed through that hall.\nMrs. Orme went out leaning on the arm of her son, but on the other\nside of her was Mr. Aram. He had remained in his seat till they had\nbegun to move, and then he followed them. Mrs. Orme was already half\nway across the court when he made his way up to her side and very\ngently touched her arm.\n\n\"Sir?\" said she, looking round.\n\n\"Do not let her be too sure,\" he said. \"Do not let her be over\nconfident. All that may go for nothing with a jury.\" Then he lifted\nhis hat and left her.\n\nAll that go for nothing with a jury! She hardly understood this, but\nyet she felt that it all should go for nothing if right were done.\nHer mind was not argumentative, nor yet perhaps was her sense of true\njustice very acute. When Sir Peregrine had once hinted that it would\nbe well that the criminal should be pronounced guilty, because in\ntruth she had been guilty, Mrs. Orme by no means agreed with him. But\nnow, having heard how those wretched witnesses had been denounced,\nknowing how true had been the words they had spoken, knowing how\nfalse were those assurances of innocence with which Mr. Furnival had\nbeen so fluent, she felt something of that spirit which had actuated\nSir Peregrine, and had almost thought that justice demanded a verdict\nagainst her friend.\n\n\"Do not let her be over-confident,\" Mr. Aram had said. But in truth\nMrs. Orme, as she had listened to Mr. Furnival's speech, had become\nalmost confident that Lady Mason would be acquitted. It had seemed to\nher impossible that any jury should pronounce her to be guilty after\nthat speech. The state of her mind as she listened to it had been\nvery painful. Lady Mason's hand had rested in her own during a great\nportion of it; and it would have been natural that she should give\nsome encouragement to her companion by a touch, by a slight pressure,\nas the warm words of praise fell from the lawyer's mouth. But how\ncould she do so, knowing that the praise was false? It was not\npossible to her to show her friendship by congratulating her friend\non the success of a lie. Lady Mason also had, no doubt, felt this,\nfor after a while her hand had been withdrawn, and they had both\nlistened in silence, giving no signs to each other as to their\nfeelings on the subject.\n\nBut as they sat together in the carriage Lucius did give vent to his\nfeelings. \"I cannot understand why all that should not have been said\nbefore, and said in a manner to have been as convincing as it was\nto-day.\"\n\n\"I suppose there was no opportunity before the trial,\" said Mrs.\nOrme, feeling that she must say something, but feeling also how\nimpossible it was to speak on the subject with any truth in the\npresence both of Lady Mason and her son.\n\n\"But an occasion should have been made,\" said Lucius. \"It is\nmonstrous that my mother should have been subjected to this\naccusation for months and that no one till now should have spoken out\nto show how impossible it is that she should have been guilty.\"\n\n\"Ah! Lucius, you do not understand,\" said his mother.\n\n\"And I hope I never may,\" said he. \"Why did not the jury get up in\ntheir seats at once and pronounce their verdict when Mr. Furnival's\nspeech was over? Why should they wait there, giving another day of\nprolonged trouble, knowing as they must do what their verdict will\nbe? To me all this is incomprehensible, seeing that no good can in\nany way come from it.\"\n\nAnd so he went on, striving to urge his companions to speak upon a\nsubject which to them did not admit of speech in his presence. It was\nvery painful to them, for in addressing Mrs. Orme he almost demanded\nfrom her some expression of triumph. \"You at least have believed in\nher innocence,\" he said at last, \"and have not been ashamed to show\nthat you did so.\"\n\n\"Lucius,\" said his mother, \"we are very weary; do not speak to us\nnow. Let us rest till we are at home.\" Then they closed their eyes\nand there was silence till the carriage drove up to the door of Orley\nFarm House.\n\nThe two ladies immediately went up stairs, but Lucius, with more\ncheerfulness about him than he had shown for months past, remained\nbelow to give orders for their supper. It had been a joy to him to\nhear Joseph Mason and Dockwrath exposed, and to listen to those words\nwhich had so clearly told the truth as to his mother's history. All\nthat torrent of indignant eloquence had been to him an enumeration of\nthe simple facts,--of the facts as he knew them to be,--of the facts\nas they would now be made plain to all the world. At last the day had\ncome when the cloud would be blown away. He, looking down from the\nheight of his superior intellect on the folly of those below him, had\nbeen indignant at the great delay;--but that he would now forgive.\n\nThey had not been long in the house, perhaps about fifteen minutes,\nwhen Mrs. Orme returned down stairs and gently entered the\ndining-room. He was still there, standing with his back to the fire\nand thinking over the work of the day.\n\n\"Your mother will not come down this evening, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Not come down?\"\n\n\"No; she is very tired,--very tired indeed. I fear you hardly know\nhow much she has gone through.\"\n\n\"Shall I go to her?\" said Lucius.\n\n\"No, Mr. Mason, do not do that. I will return to her now.\nAnd--but;--in a few minutes, Mr. Mason, I will come back to you\nagain, for I shall have something to say to you.\"\n\n\"You will have tea here?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think not. When I have spoken to you I will go back\nto your mother. I came down now in order that you might not wait for\nus.\" And then she left the room and again went up stairs. It annoyed\nhim that his mother should thus keep away from him, but still he\ndid not think that there was any special reason for it. Mrs. Orme's\nmanner had been strange; but then everything around them in these\ndays was strange, and it did not occur to him that Mrs. Orme would\nhave aught to say in her promised interview which would bring to him\nany new cause for sorrow.\n\nLady Mason, when Mrs. Orme returned to her, was sitting exactly in\nthe position in which she had been left. Her bonnet was off and was\nlying by her side, and she was seated in a large arm-chair, again\nholding both her hands to the sides of her head. No attempt had been\nmade to smooth her hair or to remove the dust and soil which had\ncome from the day's long sitting in the court. She was a woman very\ncareful in her toilet, and scrupulously nice in all that touched her\nperson. But now all that had been neglected, and her whole appearance\nwas haggard and dishevelled.\n\n\"You have not told him?\" she said.\n\n\"No; I have not told him yet; but I have bidden him expect me. He\nknows that I am coming to him.\"\n\n\"And how did he look?\"\n\n\"I did not see his face.\" And then there was silence between them\nfor a few minutes, during which Mrs. Orme stood at the back of Lady\nMason's chair with her hand on Lady Mason's shoulder. \"Shall I go\nnow, dear?\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"No; stay a moment; not yet. Oh, Mrs. Orme!\"\n\n\"You will find that you will be stronger and better able to bear it\nwhen it has been done.\"\n\n\"Stronger! Why should I wish to be stronger? How will he bear it?\"\n\n\"It will be a blow to him, of course.\"\n\n\"It will strike him to the ground, Mrs. Orme. I shall have murdered\nhim. I do not think that he will live when he knows that he is so\ndisgraced.\"\n\n\"He is a man, and will bear it as a man should do. Shall I do\nanything for you before I go?\"\n\n\"Stay a moment. Why must it be to-night?\"\n\n\"He must not be in the court to-morrow. And what difference will one\nday make? He must know it when the property is given up.\"\n\nThen there was a knock at the door, and a girl entered with a\ndecanter, two wine-glasses, and a slice or two of bread and butter.\n\"You must drink that,\" said Mrs. Orme, pouring out a glass of wine.\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Yes, I will take some too. There. I shall be stronger now. Nay, Lady\nMason, you shall drink it. And now if you will take my advice you\nwill go to bed.\"\n\n\"You will come to me again?\"\n\n\"Yes; directly it is over. Of course I shall come to you. Am I not to\nstay here all night?\"\n\n\"But him;--I will not see him. He is not to come.\"\n\n\"That will be as he pleases.\"\n\n\"No. You promised that. I cannot see him when he knows what I have\ndone for him.\"\n\n\"Not to hear him say that he forgives you?\"\n\n\"He will not forgive me. You do not know him. Could you bear to look\nat your boy if you had disgraced him for ever?\"\n\n\"Whatever I might have done he would not desert me. Nor will Lucius\ndesert you. Shall I go now?\"\n\n\"Ah, me! Would that I were in my grave!\"\n\nThen Mrs. Orme bent over her and kissed her, pressed both her hands,\nthen kissed her again, and silently creeping out of the room made her\nway once more slowly down the stairs.\n\nMrs. Orme, as will have been seen, was sufficiently anxious to\nperform the task which she had given herself, but yet her heart sank\nwithin her as she descended to the parlour. It was indeed a terrible\ncommission, and her readiness to undertake it had come not from any\nfeeling on her own part that she was fit for the work and could do\nit without difficulty, but from the eagerness with which she had\npersuaded Lady Mason that the thing must be done by some one. And\nnow who else could do it? In Sir Peregrine's present state it would\nhave been a cruelty to ask him; and then his feelings towards Lucius\nin the matter were not tender as were those of Mrs. Orme. She had\nbeen obliged to promise that she herself would do it, or otherwise\nshe could not have urged the doing. And now the time had come.\nImmediately on their return to the house Mrs. Orme had declared that\nthe story should be told at once; and then Lady Mason, sinking into\nthe chair from which she had not since risen, had at length agreed\nthat it should be so. The time had now come, and Mrs. Orme, whose\nfootsteps down the stairs had not been audible, stood for a moment\nwith the handle of the door in her hand.\n\nHad it been possible she also would now have put it off till the\nmorrow,--would have put it off till any other time than that which\nwas then present. All manner of thoughts crowded on her during those\nfew seconds. In what way should she do it? What words should she use?\nHow should she begin? She was to tell this young man that his mother\nhad committed a crime of the very blackest dye, and now she felt that\nshe should have prepared herself and resolved in what fashion this\nshould be done. Might it not be well, she asked herself for one\nmoment, that she should take the night to think of it and then see\nhim in the morning? The idea, however, only lasted her for a moment,\nand then, fearing lest she might allow herself to be seduced into\nsome weakness, she turned the handle and entered the room.\n\nHe was still standing with his back to the fire, leaning against\nthe mantelpiece, and thinking over the occurrences of the day that\nwas past. His strongest feeling now was one of hatred to Joseph\nMason,--of hatred mixed with thorough contempt. What must men say of\nhim after such a struggle on his part to ruin the fame of a lady and\nto steal the patrimony of a brother! \"Is she still determined not to\ncome down?\" he said as soon as he saw Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"No; she will not come down to-night, Mr. Mason. I have something\nthat I must tell you.\"\n\n\"What! is she ill? Has it been too much for her?\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason,\" she said, \"I hardly know how to do what I have\nundertaken.\" And he could see that she actually trembled as she spoke\nto him.\n\n\"What is it, Mrs. Orme? Is it anything about the property? I think\nyou need hardly be afraid of me. I believe I may say I could bear\nanything of that kind.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason--\" And then again she stopped herself.\n\nHow was she to speak this horrible word?\n\n\"Is it anything about the trial?\" He was now beginning to be\nfrightened, feeling that something terrible was coming; but still of\nthe absolute truth he had no suspicion.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Mason, if it were possible that I could spare you I would do\nso. If there were any escape,--any way in which it might be avoided.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said he. And now his voice was hoarse and low, for a\nfeeling of fear had come upon him. \"I am a man and can bear it,\nwhatever it is.\"\n\n\"You must be a man then, for it is very terrible. Mr. Mason, that\nwill, you know--\"\n\n\"You mean the codicil?\"\n\n\"The will that gave you the property--\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"It was not done by your father.\"\n\n\"Who says so?\"\n\n\"It is too sure. It was not done by him,--nor by them,--those other\npeople who were in the court to-day.\"\n\n\"But who says so? How is it known? If my father did not sign it, it\nis a forgery; and who forged it? Those wretches have bought over some\none and you have been deceived, Mrs. Orme. It is not of the property\nI am thinking, but of my mother. If it were as you say, my mother\nmust have known it?\"\n\n\"Ah! yes.\"\n\n\"And you mean that she did know it; that she knew it was a forgery?\"\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Heaven and earth! Let me go to her. If she were to tell me so\nherself I would not believe it of her. Ah! she has told you?\"\n\n\"Yes; she has told me.\"\n\n\"Then she is mad. This has been too much for her, and her brain has\ngone with it. Let me go to her, Mrs. Orme.\"\n\n\"No, no; you must not go to her.\" And Mrs. Orme put herself directly\nbefore the door. \"She is not mad,--not now. Then, at that time, we\nmust think she was so. It is not so now.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand you.\" And he put his left hand up to his\nforehead as though to steady his thoughts. \"I do not understand you.\nIf the will be a forgery, who did it?\"\n\nThis question she could not answer at the moment. She was still\nstanding against the door, and her eyes fell to the ground. \"Who did\nit?\" he repeated. \"Whose hand wrote my father's name?\"\n\n\"You must be merciful, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Merciful;--to whom?\"\n\n\"To your mother.\"\n\n\"Merciful to my mother! Mrs. Orme, speak out to me. If the will was\nforged, who forged it? You cannot mean to tell me that she did it!\"\n\nShe did not answer him at the moment in words, but coming close up to\nhim she took both his hands in hers, and then looked steadfastly up\ninto his eyes. His face had now become almost convulsed with emotion,\nand his brow was very black. \"Do you wish me to believe that my\nmother forged the will herself?\" Then again he paused, but she\nsaid nothing. \"Woman, it's a lie,\" he exclaimed; and then tearing\nhis hands from her, shaking her off, and striding away with quick\nfootsteps, he threw himself on a sofa that stood in the furthest part\nof the room.\n\nShe paused for a moment and then followed him very gently. She\nfollowed him and stood over him in silence for a moment, as he lay\nwith his face from her. \"Mr. Mason,\" she said at last, \"you told me\nthat you would bear this like a man.\"\n\nBut he made her no answer, and she went on. \"Mr. Mason, it is, as I\ntell you. Years and years ago, when you were a baby, and when she\nthought that your father was unjust to you--for your sake,--to remedy\nthat injustice, she did this thing.\"\n\n\"What; forged his name! It must be a lie. Though an angel came to\ntell me so, it would be a lie! What; my mother!\" And now he turned\nround and faced her, still however lying on the sofa.\n\n\"It is true, Mr. Mason. Oh, how I wish that it were not! But you\nmust forgive her. It is years ago, and she has repented of it, Sir\nPeregrine has forgiven her,--and I have done so.\"\n\nAnd then she told him the whole story. She told him why the marriage\nhad been broken off, and described to him the manner in which the\ntruth had been made known to Sir Peregrine. It need hardly be said,\nthat in doing so, she dealt as softly as was possible with his\nmother's name; but yet she told him everything. \"She wrote it\nherself, in the night.\"\n\n\"What all; all the names herself?\"\n\n\"Yes, all.\"\n\n\"Mrs. Orme, it cannot be so. I will not believe it. To me it is\nimpossible. That you believe it I do not doubt, but I cannot. Let\nme go to her. I will go to her myself. But even should she say so\nherself, I will not believe it.\"\n\nBut she would not let him go up stairs even though he attempted to\nmove her from the door, almost with violence. \"No; not till you say\nthat you will forgive her and be gentle with her. And it must not be\nto-night. We will be up early in the morning, and you can see her\nbefore we go;--if you will be gentle to her.\"\n\nHe still persisted that he did not believe the story, but it became\nclear to her, by degrees, that the meaning of it all had at last sunk\ninto his mind, and that he did believe it. Over and over again she\ntold him all that she knew, explaining to him what his mother had\nsuffered, making him perceive why she had removed herself out of his\nhands, and had leant on others for advice. And she told him also that\nthough they still hoped that the jury might acquit her, the property\nmust be abandoned.\n\n\"I will leave the house this night if you wish it,\" he said.\n\n\"When it is all over, when she has been acquitted and shall have gone\naway, then let it be done. Mr. Mason, you will go with her; will you\nnot?\" and then again there was a pause.\n\n\"Mrs. Orme, it is impossible that I should say now what I may do. It\nseems to me as though I could not live through it. I do not believe\nit. I cannot believe it.\"\n\nAs soon as she had exacted a promise from him that he would not go\nto his mother, at any rate without further notice, she herself went\nup stairs and found Lady Mason lying on her bed. At first Mrs. Orme\nthought that she was asleep, but no such comfort had come to the poor\nwoman. \"Does he know it?\" she asked.\n\nMrs. Orme's task for that night was by no means yet done. After\nremaining for a while with Lady Mason she again returned to Lucius,\nand was in this way a bearer of messages between them. There was at\nlast no question as to doubting the story. He did believe it. He\ncould not avoid the necessity for such belief. \"Yes,\" he said, when\nMrs. Orme spoke again of his leaving the place, \"I will go and hide\nmyself; and as for her--\"\n\n\"But you will go with her,--if the jury do not say that she was\nguilty--\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. Orme!\"\n\n\"If they do, you will come back for her, when the time of her\npunishment is over? She is still your mother, Mr. Mason.\"\n\nAt last the work of the night was done, and the two ladies went to\ntheir beds. The understanding was that Lucius should see his mother\nbefore they started in the morning, but that he should not again\naccompany them to the court. Mrs. Orme's great object had been,--her\ngreat object as regarded the present moment,--to prevent his presence\nin court when the verdict should be given. In this she had succeeded.\nShe could now wish for an acquittal with a clear conscience; and\ncould as it were absolve the sinner within her own heart, seeing that\nthere was no longer any doubt as to the giving up of the property.\nWhatever might be the verdict of the jury Joseph Mason of Groby\nwould, without doubt, obtain the property which belonged to him.\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. Mason,\" Mrs. Orme said at last, as she gave him her\nhand.\n\n\"Good-night. I believe that in my madness I spoke to you to-night\nlike a brute.\"\n\n\"No, no. It was nothing. I did not think of it.\"\n\n\"When you think of how it was with me, you will forgive me.\"\n\nShe pressed his hand and again told him that she had not thought of\nit. It was nothing. And indeed it had been as nothing to her. There\nmay be moments in a man's life when any words may be forgiven, even\nthough they be spoken to a woman.\n\nWhen Mrs. Orme was gone, he stood for a while perfectly motionless\nin the dining-room, and then coming out into the hall he opened the\nfront door, and taking his hat, went out into the night. It was still\nwinter, but the night, though cold and very dark, was fine, and the\nair was sharp with the beginning frost. Leaving the door open he\nwalked forth, and passing out on to the road went down from thence\nto the gate. It had been his constant practice to walk up and down\nfrom his own hall door to his own gate on the high road, perhaps\ncomforting himself too warmly with the reflection that the ground\non which he walked was all his own. He had no such comfort now, as\nhe made his way down the accustomed path and leaned upon the gate,\nthinking over what he had heard.\n\n[Illustration: Lucius Mason, as he leaned on the Gate\nthat was no longer his own.]\n\nA forger! At some such hour as this, with patient premeditated care,\nshe had gone to work and committed one of the vilest crimes known\nto man. And this was his mother! And he, he, Lucius Mason, had been\nliving for years on the fruit of this villainy;--had been so living\ntill this terrible day of retribution had come upon him! I fear that\nat that moment he thought more of his own misery than he did of hers,\nand hardly considered, as he surely should have done, that mother's\nlove which had led to all this guilt. And for a moment he resolved\nthat he would not go back to the house. His head, he said to himself,\nshould never again rest under a roof which belonged of right\nto Joseph Mason. He had injured Joseph Mason;--had injured him\ninnocently, indeed, as far as he himself was concerned; but he had\ninjured him greatly, and therefore now hated him all the more. \"He\nshall have it instantly,\" he said, and walked forth into the high\nroad as though he would not allow his feet to rest again on his\nbrother's property.\n\nBut he was forced to remember that this could not be so. His mother's\ntrial was not yet over, and even in the midst of his own personal\ntrouble he remembered that the verdict to her was still a matter of\nterrible import. He would not let it be known that he had abandoned\nthe property, at any rate till that verdict had been given. And then\nas he moved back to the house he tried to think in what way it would\nbecome him to behave to his mother. \"She can never be my mother\nagain,\" he said to himself. They were terrible words;--but then was\nnot his position very terrible?\n\nAnd when at last he had bolted the front door, going through the\naccustomed task mechanically, and had gone up stairs to his own room,\nhe had failed to make up his mind on this subject. Perhaps it would\nbe better that he should not see her. What could he say to her? What\nword of comfort could he speak? It was not only that she had beggared\nhim! Nay; it was not that at all! But she had doomed him to a life of\ndisgrace which no effort of his own could wipe away. And then as he\nthrew himself on his bed he thought of Sophia Furnival. Would she\nshare his disgrace with him? Was it possible that there might be\nsolace there?\n\nQuite impossible, we should say, who know her well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\n\nYOUNG LOCHINVAR.\n\n\nJudge Staveley, whose court had not been kept sitting to a late hour\nby any such eloquence as that of Mr. Furnival, had gone home before\nthe business of the other court had closed. Augustus, who was his\nfather's marshal, remained for his friend, and had made his way in\namong the crowd, so as to hear the end of the speech.\n\n\"Don't wait dinner for us,\" he had said to his father. \"If you do you\nwill be hating us all the time; and we sha'n't be there till between\neight and nine.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry to hate you,\" said the judge, \"and so I won't.\"\nWhen therefore Felix Graham escaped from the court at about half-past\nseven, the two young men were able to take their own time and eat\ntheir dinner together comfortably, enjoying their bottle of champagne\nbetween them perhaps more thoroughly than they would have done had\nthe judge and Mrs. Staveley shared it with them.\n\nBut Felix had something of which to think besides the\nchampagne--something which was of more consequence to him even than\nthe trial in which he was engaged. Madeline had promised that she\nwould meet him that evening;--or rather had not so promised. When\nasked to do so she had not refused, but even while not refusing had\nreminded him that her mother would be there. Her manner to him had,\nhe thought, been cold, though she had not been ungracious. Upon the\nwhole, he could not make up his mind to expect success. \"Then he must\nhave been a fool!\" the reader learned in such matters will say. The\nreader learned in such matters is, I think, right. In that respect he\nwas a fool.\n\n\"I suppose we must give the governor the benefit of our company over\nhis wine,\" said Augustus, as soon as their dinner was over.\n\n\"I suppose we ought to do so.\"\n\n\"And why not? Is there any objection?\"\n\n\"To tell the truth,\" said Graham, \"I have an appointment which I am\nvery anxious to keep.\"\n\n\"An appointment? Where? Here at Noningsby, do you mean?\"\n\n\"In this house. But yet I cannot say that it is absolutely an\nappointment. I am going to ask your sister what my fate is to be.\"\n\n\"And that is the appointment! Very well, my dear fellow; and may God\nprosper you. If you can convince the governor that it is all right, I\nshall make no objection. I wish, for Madeline's sake, that you had\nnot such a terrible bee in your bonnet.\"\n\n\"And you will go to the judge alone?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. I'll tell him--. What shall I tell him?\"\n\n\"The truth, if you will. Good-bye, old fellow. You will not see me\nagain to-night, nor yet to-morrow in this house, unless I am more\nfortunate than I have any right to hope to be.\"\n\n\"Faint heart never won fair lady, you know,\" said Augustus.\n\n\"My heart is faint enough then; but nevertheless I shall say what I\nhave got to say.\" And then he got up from the table.\n\n\"If you don't come down to us,\" said Augustus, \"I shall come up to\nyou. But may God speed you. And now I'll go to the governor.\"\n\nFelix made his way from the small breakfast-parlour in which they had\ndined across the hall into the drawing-room, and there he found Lady\nStaveley alone. \"So the trial is not over yet, Mr. Graham?\" she said.\n\n\"No; there will be another day of it.\"\n\n\"And what will be the verdict? Is it possible that she really forged\nthe will?\"\n\n\"Ah! that I cannot say. You know that I am one of her counsel, Lady\nStaveley?\"\n\n\"Yes; I should have remembered that, and been more discreet. If you\nare looking for Madeline, Mr. Graham, I think that she is in the\nlibrary.\"\n\n\"Oh! thank you;--in the library.\" And then Felix got himself out of\nthe drawing-room into the hall again not in the most graceful manner.\nHe might have gone direct from the drawing-room to the library, but\nthis he did not remember. It was very odd, he thought, that Lady\nStaveley, of whose dislike to him he had felt sure, should have thus\nsent him direct to her daughter, and have become a party, as it were,\nto an appointment between them. But he had not much time to think of\nthis before he found himself in the room. There, sure enough, was\nMadeline waiting to listen to his story. She was seated when he\nentered, with her back to him; but as she heard him she rose, and,\nafter pausing for a moment, she stepped forward to meet him.\n\n\"You and Augustus were very late to-day,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes. I was kept there, and he was good enough to wait for me.\"\n\n\"You said you wanted to--speak to me,\" she said, hesitating a little,\nbut yet very little; \"to speak to me alone; and so mamma said I had\nbetter come in here. I hope you are not vexed that I should have told\nher.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Miss Staveley.\"\n\n\"Because I have no secrets from mamma.\"\n\n\"Nor do I wish that anything should be secret. I hate all secrecies.\nMiss Staveley, your father knows of my intention.\"\n\nOn this point Madeline did not feel it to be necessary to say\nanything. Of course her father knew of the intention. Had she not\nreceived her father's sanction for listening to Mr. Graham she would\nnot have been alone with him in the library. It might be that the\ntime would come in which she would explain all this to her lover,\nbut that time had not come yet. So when he spoke of her father she\nremained silent, and allowing her eyes to fall to the ground she\nstood before him, waiting to hear his question.\n\n\"Miss Staveley,\" he said;--and he was conscious himself of being very\nawkward. Much more so, indeed, than there was any need, for Madeline\nwas not aware that he was awkward. In her eyes he was quite master\nof the occasion, and seemed to have everything his own way. He had\nalready done all that was difficult in the matter, and had done it\nwithout any awkwardness. He had already made himself master of her\nheart, and it was only necessary now that he should enter in and take\npossession. The ripe fruit had fallen, as Miss Furnival had once\nchosen to express it, and there he was to pick it up,--if only he\nconsidered it worth his trouble to do so. That manner of the picking\nwould not signify much, as Madeline thought. That he desired to take\nit into his garner and preserve it for his life's use was everything\nto her, but the method of his words at the present moment was\nnot much. He was her lord and master. He was the one man who had\nconquered and taken possession of her spirit; and as to his being\nawkward, there was not much in that. Nor do I say that he was\nawkward. He spoke his mind in honest, plain terms, and I do not know\nhe could have done better.\n\n\"Miss Staveley,\" he said, \"in asking you to see me alone, I have made\na great venture. I am indeed risking all that I most value.\" And then\nhe paused, as though he expected that she would speak. But she still\nkept her eyes upon the ground, and still stood silent before him.\n\"I cannot but think you must guess my purpose,\" he said, \"though I\nacknowledge that I have had nothing that can warrant me in hoping for\na favourable answer. There is my hand; if you can take it you need\nnot doubt that you have my heart with it.\" And then he held out to\nher his broad, right hand.\n\nMadeline still stood silent before him and still fixed her eyes upon\nthe ground, but very slowly she raised her little hand and allowed\nher soft slight fingers to rest upon his open palm. It was as though\nshe thus affixed her legal signature and seal to the deed of gift.\nShe had not said a word to him; not a word of love or a word of\nassent; but no such word was now necessary.\n\n\"Madeline, my own Madeline,\" he said; and then taking unfair\nadvantage of the fingers which she had given him he drew her to his\nbreast and folded her in his arms.\n\nIt was nearly an hour after this when he returned to the\ndrawing-room. \"Do go in now,\" she said. \"You must not wait any\nlonger; indeed you must go.\"\n\n\"And you--; you will come in presently.\"\n\n\"It is already nearly eleven. No, I will not show myself again\nto-night. Mamma will soon come up to me, I know. Good-night, Felix.\nDo you go now, and I will follow you.\" And then after some further\nlittle ceremony he left her.\n\nWhen he entered the drawing-room Lady Staveley was there, and the\njudge with his teacup beside him, and Augustus standing with his back\nto the fire. Felix walked up to the circle, and taking a chair sat\ndown, but at the moment said nothing.\n\n\"You didn't get any wine after your day's toil, Master Graham,\" said\nthe judge.\n\n\"Indeed I did, sir. We had some champagne.\"\n\n\"Champagne, had you? Then I ought to have waited for my guest, for I\ngot none. You had a long day of it in court.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed, sir.\"\n\n\"And I am afraid not very satisfactory.\" To this Graham made no\nimmediate answer, but he could not refrain from thinking that the\nday, taken altogether, had been satisfactory to him.\n\nAnd then Baker came into the room, and going close up to Lady\nStaveley, whispered something in her ear. \"Oh, ah, yes,\" said Lady\nStaveley. \"I must wish you good night, Mr. Graham.\" And she took his\nhand, pressing it very warmly. But though she wished him good night\nthen, she saw him again before he went to bed. It was a family in\nwhich all home affairs were very dear, and a new son could not be\nwelcomed into it without much expression of affection.\n\n\"Well, sir! and how have you sped since dinner?\" the judge asked as\nsoon as the door was closed behind his wife.\n\n\"I have proposed to your daughter and she has accepted me.\" And as\nhe said so he rose from the chair in which he had just now seated\nhimself.\n\n\"Then, my boy, I hope you will make her a good husband;\" and the\njudge gave him his hand.\n\n\"I will try to do so. I cannot but feel, however, how little right I\nhad to ask her, seeing that I am likely to be so poor a man.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well--we will talk of that another time. At present we\nwill only sing your triumphs--\n\n\n   \"So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,\n    There never was knight like the young Lochinvar.\"\n\n\n\"Felix, my dear fellow, I congratulate you with all my heart,\" said\nAugustus. \"But I did not know you were good as a warrior.\"\n\n\"Ah, but he is though,\" said the judge. \"What do you think of his\nwounds? And if all that I hear be true, he has other battles on hand.\nBut we must not speak about that till this poor lady's trial is\nover.\"\n\n\"I need hardly tell you, sir,\" said Graham, with that sheep-like air\nwhich a man always carries on such occasions, \"that I regard myself\nas the most fortunate man in the world.\"\n\n\"Quite unnecessary,\" said the judge. \"On such occasions that is taken\nas a matter of course.\" And then the conversation between them for\nthe next ten minutes was rather dull and flat.\n\nUp stairs the same thing was going on, in a manner somewhat more\nanimated, between the mother and daughter,--for ladies on such\noccasions can be more animated than men.\n\n\"Oh, mamma, you must love him,\" Madeline said.\n\n\"Yes, my dear; of course I shall love him now. Your papa says that he\nis very clever.\"\n\n\"I know papa likes him. I knew that from the very first. I think that\nwas the reason why--\"\n\n\"And I suppose clever people are the best,--that is to say, if they\nare good.\"\n\n\"And isn't he good?\"\n\n\"Well--I hope so. Indeed, I'm sure he is. Mr. Orme was a very good\nyoung man too;--but it's no good talking about him now.\"\n\n\"Mamma, that never could have come to pass.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear. It's over now, and of course all that I looked\nfor was your happiness.\"\n\n\"I know that, mamma; and indeed I am very happy. I'm sure I could not\never have liked any one else since I first knew him.\"\n\nLady Staveley still thought it very odd, but she had nothing else to\nsay. As regarded the pecuniary considerations of the affair she left\nthem altogether to her husband, feeling that in this way she could\nrelieve herself from misgivings which might otherwise make her\nunhappy. \"And after all I don't know that his ugliness signifies,\"\nshe said to herself. And so she made up her mind that she would\nbe loving and affectionate to him, and sat up till she heard his\nfootsteps in the passage, in order that she might speak to him, and\nmake him welcome to the privileges of a son-in-law.\n\n\"Mr. Graham,\" she said, opening her door as he passed by.\n\n\"Of course she has told you,\" said Felix.\n\n\"Oh yes, she has told me. We don't have many secrets in this house.\nAnd I'm sure I congratulate you with all my heart; and I think you\nhave got the very best girl in all the world. Of course I'm her\nmother; but I declare, if I was to talk of her for a week, I could\nnot say anything of her but good.\"\n\n\"I know how fortunate I am.\"\n\n\"Yes, you are fortunate. For there is nothing in the world equal to\na loving wife who will do her duty. And I'm sure you'll be good to\nher.\"\n\n\"I will endeavour to be so.\"\n\n\"A man must be very bad indeed who would be bad to her,--and I\ndon't think that of you. And it's a great thing, Mr. Graham, that\nMadeline should have loved a man of whom her papa is so fond. I\ndon't know what you have done to the judge, I'm sure.\" This she said,\nremembering in the innocence of her heart that Mr. Arbuthnot had been\na son-in-law rather after her own choice, and that the judge always\ndeclared that his eldest daughter's husband had seldom much to say\nfor himself.\n\n\"And I hope that Madeline's mother will receive me as kindly as\nMadeline's father,\" said he, taking Lady Staveley's hand and pressing\nit.\n\n\"Indeed I will. I will love you very dearly if you will let me. My\ngirls' husbands are the same to me as sons.\" Then she put up her face\nand he kissed it, and so they wished each other good night.\n\nHe found Augustus in his own room, and they two had hardly sat\nthemselves down over the fire, intending to recall the former scenes\nwhich had taken place in that very room, when a knock was heard at\nthe door, and Mrs. Baker entered.\n\n\"And so it's all settled, Mr. Felix,\" said she.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he; \"all settled.\"\n\n\"Well now! didn't I know it from the first?\"\n\n\"Then what a wicked old woman you were not to tell,\" said Augustus.\n\n\"That's all very well, Master Augustus. How would you like me to tell\nof you;--for I could, you know?\"\n\n\"You wicked old woman, you couldn't do anything of the kind.\"\n\n\"Oh, couldn't I? But I defy all the world to say a word of Miss\nMadeline but what's good,--only I did know all along which way the\nwind was blowing. Lord love you, Mr. Graham, when you came in here\nall of a smash like, I knew it wasn't for nothing.\"\n\n\"You think he did it on purpose then,\" said Staveley.\n\n\"Did it on purpose? What; make up to Miss Madeline? Why, of course he\ndid it on purpose. He's been a-thinking of it ever since Christmas\nnight, when I saw you, Master Augustus, and a certain young lady when\nyou came out into the dark passage together.\"\n\n\"That's a downright falsehood, Mrs. Baker.\"\n\n\"Oh--very well. Perhaps I was mistaken. But now, Mr. Graham, if you\ndon't treat our Miss Madeline well--\"\n\n\"That's just what I've been telling him,\" said her brother. \"If he\nuses her ill, as he did his former wife--breaks her heart as he did\nwith that one--\"\n\n\"His former wife!\" said Mrs. Baker.\n\n\"Haven't you heard of that? Why, he's had two already.\"\n\n\"Two wives already! Oh now, Master Augustus, what an old fool I am\never to believe a word that comes out of your mouth.\" Then having\nuttered her blessing, and having had her hand cordially grasped by\nthis new scion of the Staveley family, the old woman left the young\nmen to themselves, and went to her bed.\n\n\"Now that it is done--,\" said Felix.\n\n\"You wish it were undone.\"\n\n\"No, by heaven! I think I may venture to say that it will never come\nto me to wish that. But now that it is done, I am astonished at my\nown impudence almost as much as at my success. Why should your father\nhave welcomed me to his house as his son-in-law, seeing how poor are\nmy prospects?\"\n\n\"Just for that reason; and because he is so different from other men.\nI have no doubt that he is proud of Madeline for having liked a man\nwith an ugly face and no money.\"\n\n\"If I had been beautiful like you, I shouldn't have had a chance with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Not if you'd been weighted with money also. Now, as for myself, I\nconfess I'm not nearly so magnanimous as my father, and, for Mad's\nsake, I do hope you will get rid of your vagaries. An income, I know,\nis a very commonplace sort of thing; but when a man has a family\nthere are comforts attached to it.\"\n\n\"I am at any rate willing to work,\" said Graham somewhat moodily.\n\n\"Yes, if you may work exactly in your own way. But men in the world\ncan't do that. A man, as I take it, must through life allow himself\nto be governed by the united wisdom of others around him. He cannot\ntake upon himself to judge as to every step by his own lights. If\nhe does, he will be dead before he has made up his mind as to the\npreliminaries.\" And in this way Augustus Staveley from the depth of\nhis life's experience spoke words of worldly wisdom to his future\nbrother-in-law.\n\nOn the next morning before he started again for Alston and his now\nodious work, Graham succeeded in getting Madeline to himself for five\nminutes. \"I saw both your father and mother last night,\" said he,\n\"and I shall never forget their goodness to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, they are good.\"\n\n\"It seems like a dream to me that they should have accepted me as\ntheir son-in-law.\"\n\n\"But it is no dream to me, Felix;--or if so, I do not mean to wake\nany more. I used to think that I should never care very much for\nanybody out of my own family;--but now--\" And she then pressed her\nlittle hand upon his arm.\n\n\"And Felix,\" she said, as he prepared to leave her, \"you are not to\ngo away from Noningsby when the trial is over. I wanted mamma to tell\nyou, but she said I'd better do it.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV.\n\nTHE LAST DAY.\n\n\nMrs. Orme was up very early on that last morning of the trial, and\nhad dressed herself before Lady Mason was awake. It was now March,\nbut yet the morning light was hardly sufficient for her as she went\nthrough her toilet. They had been told to be in the court very\npunctually at ten, and in order to do so they must leave Orley Farm\nat nine. Before that, as had been arranged over night, Lucius was to\nsee his mother.\n\n\"You haven't told him! he doesn't know!\" were the first words which\nLady Mason spoke as she raised her head from the pillow. But then she\nremembered. \"Ah! yes,\" she said, as she again sank back and hid her\nface, \"he knows it all now.\"\n\n\"Yes, dear; he knows it all; and is it not better so? He will come\nand see you, and when that is over you will be more comfortable than\nyou have been for years past.\"\n\nLucius also had been up early, and when he learned that Mrs. Orme was\ndressed, he sent up to her begging that he might see her. Mrs. Orme\nat once went to him, and found him seated at the breakfast-table with\nhis head resting on his arm. His face was pale and haggard, and his\nhair was uncombed. He had not been undressed that night, and his\nclothes hung on him as they always do hang on a man who has passed\na sleepless night in them. To Mrs. Orme's inquiry after himself he\nanswered not a word, nor did he at first ask after his mother. \"That\nwas all true that you told me last night?\"\n\n\"Yes, Mr. Mason; it was true.\"\n\n\"And she and I must be outcasts for ever. I will endeavour to bear\nit, Mrs. Orme. As I did not put an end to my life last night I\nsuppose that I shall live and bear it. Does she expect to see me?\"\n\n\"I told her that you would come to her this morning.\"\n\n\"And what shall I say? I would not condemn my own mother; but how can\nI not condemn her?\"\n\n\"Tell her at once that you will forgive her.\"\n\n\"But it will be a lie. I have not forgiven her. I loved my mother and\nesteemed her as a pure and excellent woman. I was proud of my mother.\nHow can I forgive her for having destroyed such feelings as those?\"\n\n\"There should be nothing that a son would not forgive his mother.\"\n\n\"Ah! that is so easily spoken. Men talk of forgiveness when their\nanger rankles deepest in their hearts. In the course of years I shall\nforgive her. I hope I shall. But to say that I can forgive her now\nwould be a farce. She has broken my heart, Mrs. Orme.\"\n\n\"And has not she suffered herself? Is not her heart broken?\"\n\n\"I have been thinking of that all night. I cannot understand how she\nshould have lived for the last six months. Well; is it time that I\nshould go to her?\"\n\nMrs. Orme again went up stairs, and after another interval of half\nan hour returned to fetch him. She almost regretted that she had\nundertaken to bring them together on that morning, thinking that\nit might have been better to postpone the interview till the trial\nshould be over. She had expected that Lucius would have been softer\nin his manner. But it was too late for any such thought.\n\n\"You will find her dressed now, Mr. Mason,\" said she; \"but I conjure\nyou, as you hope for mercy yourself, to be merciful to her. She is\nyour mother, and though she has injured you by her folly, her heart\nhas been true to you through it all. Go now, and remember that\nharshness to any woman is unmanly.\"\n\n\"I can only act as I think best,\" he replied in that low stern voice\nwhich was habitual to him; and then with slow steps he went up to his\nmother's room.\n\nWhen he entered it she was standing with her eyes fixed upon the door\nand her hands clasped together. So she stood till he had closed the\ndoor behind him, and had taken a few steps on towards the centre of\nthe room. Then she rushed forward, and throwing herself on the ground\nbefore him clasped him round the knees with her arms. \"My boy, my\nboy!\" she said. And then she lay there bathing his feet with her\ntears.\n\n\"Oh! mother, what is this that she has told me?\"\n\nBut Lady Mason at the moment spoke no further words. It seemed as\nthough her heart would have burst with sobs, and when for a moment\nshe lifted up her face to his, the tears were streaming down her\ncheeks. Had it not been for that relief she could not have borne the\nsufferings which were heaped upon her.\n\n\"Mother, get up,\" he said. \"Let me raise you. It is dreadful that you\nshould lie there. Mother, let me lift you.\" But she still clung to\nhis knees, grovelling on the ground before him. \"Lucius, Lucius,\" she\nsaid, and she then sank away from him as though the strength of her\nmuscles would no longer allow her to cling to him. She sank away from\nhim and lay along the ground hiding her face upon the floor.\n\n\"Mother,\" he said, taking her gently by the arm as he knelt at her\nside, \"if you will rise I will speak to you.\"\n\n\"Your words will kill me,\" she said. \"I do not dare to look at you.\nOh! Lucius, will you ever forgive me?\"\n\nAnd yet she had done it all for him. She had done a rascally deed,\nan hideous cut-throat deed, but it had been done altogether for him.\nNo thought of her own aggrandisement had touched her mind when she\nresolved upon that forgery. As Rebekah had deceived her lord and\nrobbed Esau, the first-born, of his birthright, so had she robbed him\nwho was as Esau to her. How often had she thought of that, while her\nconscience was pleading hard against her! Had it been imputed as a\ncrime to Rebekah that she had loved her own son well, and loving him\nhad put a crown upon his head by means of her matchless guile? Did\nshe love Lucius, her babe, less than Rebekah had loved Jacob? And had\nshe not striven with the old man, struggling that she might do this\njust thing without injustice, till in his anger he had thrust her\nfrom him. \"I will not break my promise for the brat,\" the old man had\nsaid;--and then she did the deed. But all that was as nothing now.\nShe felt no comfort now from that Bible story which had given her\nsuch encouragement before the thing was finished. Now the result of\nevil-doing had come full home to her, and she was seeking pardon with\na broken heart, while burning tears furrowed her cheeks,--not from\nhim whom she had thought to injure, but from the child of her own\nbosom, for whose prosperity she had been so anxious.\n\nThen she slowly arose and allowed him to place her upon the sofa.\n\"Mother,\" he said, \"it is all over here.\"\n\n\"Ah! yes.\"\n\n\"Whither we had better go, I cannot yet say,--or when. We must wait\ntill this day is ended.\"\n\n\"Lucius, I care nothing for myself,--nothing. It is nothing to me\nwhether or no they say that I am guilty. It is of you only that I am\nthinking.\"\n\n\"Our lot, mother, must still be together. If they find you guilty\nyou will be imprisoned, and then I will go, and come back when they\nrelease you. For you and me the future world will be very different\nfrom the past.\"\n\n\"It need not be so,--for you, Lucius. I do not wish to keep you near\nme now.\"\n\n\"But I shall be near you. Where you hide your shame there will I\nhide mine. In this world there is nothing left for us. But there is\nanother world before you,--if you can repent of your sin.\" This too\nhe said very sternly, standing somewhat away from her, and frowning\nthe while with those gloomy eyebrows. Sad as was her condition he\nmight have given her solace, could he have taken her by the hand and\nkissed her. Peregrine Orme would have done so, or Augustus Staveley,\ncould it have been possible that they should have found themselves\nin that position. Though Lucius Mason could not do so, he was not\nless just than they, and, it may be, not less loving in his heart.\nHe could devote himself for his mother's sake as absolutely as could\nthey. But to some is given and to some is denied that cruse of\nheavenly balm with which all wounds can be assuaged and sore hearts\never relieved of some portion of their sorrow. Of all the virtues\nwith which man can endow himself surely none other is so odious as\nthat justice which can teach itself to look down upon mercy almost as\na vice!\n\n\"I will not ask you to forgive me,\" she said, plaintively.\n\n\"Mother,\" he answered, \"were I to say that I forgave you my words\nwould be a mockery. I have no right either to condemn or to forgive.\nI accept my position as it has been made for me, and will endeavour\nto do my duty.\"\n\nIt would have been almost better for her that he should have\nupbraided her for her wickedness. She would then have fallen again\nprostrate before him, if not in body at least in spirit, and\nher weakness would have stood for her in place of strength. But\nnow it was necessary that she should hear his words and bear his\nlooks,--bear them like a heavy burden on her back without absolutely\nsinking. It had been that necessity of bearing and never absolutely\nsinking which, during years past, had so tried and tested the\nstrength of her heart and soul. Seeing that she had not sunk, we may\nsay that her strength had been very wonderful.\n\nAnd then she stood up and came close to him. \"But you will give me\nyour hand, Lucius?\"\n\n\"Yes, mother; there is my hand. I shall stand by you through it all.\"\nBut he did not offer to kiss her; and there was still some pride in\nher heart which would not allow her to ask him for an embrace.\n\n\"And now,\" he said, \"it is time that you should prepare to go. Mrs.\nOrme thinks it better that I should not accompany you.\"\n\n\"No, Lucius, no; you must not hear them proclaim my guilt in court.\"\n\n\"That would make but little difference. But nevertheless I will not\ngo. Had I known this before I should not have gone there. It was to\ntestify my belief in your innocence; nay, my conviction--\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucius, spare me!\"\n\n\"Well, I will speak of it no more. I shall be here to-night when you\ncome back.\"\n\n\"But if they say that I am guilty they will take me away.\"\n\n\"If so I will come to you,--in the morning if they will let me. But,\nmother, in any case I must leave this house to-morrow.\" Then again\nhe gave her his hand, but he left her without touching her with his\nlips.\n\nWhen the two ladies appeared in court together without Lucius Mason\nthere was much question among the crowd as to the cause of his\nabsence. Both Dockwrath and Joseph Mason looked at it in the right\nlight, and accepted it as a ground for renewed hope. \"He dare not\nface the verdict,\" said Dockwrath. And yet when they had left the\ncourt on the preceding evening, after listening to Mr. Furnival's\nspeech, their hopes had not been very high. Dockwrath had not\nadmitted with words that he feared defeat, but when Mason had gnashed\nhis teeth as he walked up and down his room at Alston, and striking\nthe table with his clenched fist had declared his fears, \"By heavens\nthey will escape me again!\" Dockwrath had not been able to give him\nsubstantial comfort. \"The jury are not such fools as to take all\nthat for gospel,\" he had said. But he had not said it with that tone\nof assured conviction which he had always used till Mr. Furnival's\nspeech had been made. There could have been no greater attestation\nto the power displayed by Mr. Furnival than Mr. Mason's countenance\nas he left the court on that evening. \"I suppose it will cost me\nhundreds of pounds,\" he said to Dockwrath that evening. \"Orley Farm\nwill pay for it all,\" Dockwrath had answered; but his answer had\nshown no confidence. And, if we think well of it, Joseph Mason was\ndeserving of pity. He wanted only what was his own; and that Orley\nFarm ought to be his own he had no smallest doubt. Mr. Furnival had\nnot in the least shaken him; but he had made him feel that others\nwould be shaken. \"If it could only be left to the judge,\" thought Mr.\nMason to himself. And then he began to consider whether this British\npalladium of an unanimous jury had not in it more of evil than of\ngood.\n\nYoung Peregrine Orme again met his mother at the door of the court,\nand at her instance gave his arm to Lady Mason. Mr. Aram was also\nthere; but Mr. Aram had great tact, and did not offer his arm to Mrs.\nOrme, contenting himself with making a way for her and walking beside\nher. \"I am glad that her son has not come to-day,\" he said, not\nbringing his head suspiciously close to hers, but still speaking so\nthat none but she might hear him. \"He has done all the good that he\ncould do, and as there is only the judge's charge to hear, the jury\nwill not notice his absence. Of course we hope for the best, Mrs.\nOrme, but it is doubtful.\"\n\nAs Felix Graham took his place next to Chaffanbrass, the old lawyer\nscowled at him, turning his red old savage eyes first on him and then\nfrom him, growling the while, so that the whole court might notice\nit. The legal portion of the court did notice it and were much\namused. \"Good morning, Mr. Chaffanbrass,\" said Graham quite aloud as\nhe took his seat; and then Chaffanbrass growled again. Considering\nthe lights with which he had been lightened, there was a species of\nhonesty about Mr. Chaffanbrass which certainly deserved praise. He\nwas always true to the man whose money he had taken, and gave to his\ncustomer, with all the power at his command, that assistance which he\nhad professed to sell. But we may give the same praise to the hired\nbravo who goes through with truth and courage the task which he has\nundertaken. I knew an assassin in Ireland who professed that during\ntwelve years of practice in Tipperary he had never failed when he had\nonce engaged himself. For truth and honesty to their customers--which\nare great virtues--I would bracket that man and Mr. Chaffanbrass\ntogether.\n\nAnd then the judge commenced his charge, and as he went on with it\nhe repeated all the evidence that was in any way of moment, pulling\nthe details to pieces, and dividing that which bore upon the subject\nfrom that which did not. This he did with infinite talent and with a\nperspicuity beyond all praise. But to my thinking it was remarkable\nthat he seemed to regard the witnesses as a dissecting surgeon may\nbe supposed to regard the subjects on which he operates for the\nadvancement of science. With exquisite care he displayed what each\nhad said and how the special saying of one bore on that special\nsaying of another. But he never spoke of them as though they had been\nlive men and women who were themselves as much entitled to justice\nat his hands as either the prosecutor in this matter or she who was\nbeing prosecuted; who, indeed, if anything, were better entitled\nunless he could show that they were false and suborned; for unless\nthey were suborned or false they were there doing a painful duty to\nthe public, for which they were to receive no pay and from which they\nwere to obtain no benefit. Of whom else in that court could so much\nbe said? The judge there had his ermine and his canopy, his large\nsalary and his seat of honour. And the lawyers had their wigs, and\ntheir own loud voices, and their places of precedence. The attorneys\nhad their seats and their big tables, and the somewhat familiar\nrespect of the tipstaves. The jury, though not much to be envied,\nwere addressed with respect and flattery, had their honourable seats,\nand were invariably at least called gentlemen. But why should there\nbe no seat of honour for the witnesses? To stand in a box, to be\nbawled after by the police, to be scowled at and scolded by the\njudge, to be browbeaten and accused falsely by the barristers, and\nthen to be condemned as perjurers by the jury,--that is the fate of\nthe one person who during the whole trial is perhaps entitled to\nthe greatest respect, and is certainly entitled to the most public\ngratitude. Let the witness have a big arm-chair, and a canopy over\nhim, and a man behind him with a red cloak to do him honour and keep\nthe flies off; let him be gently invited to come forward from some\ninner room where he can sit before a fire. Then he will be able to\nspeak out, making himself heard without scolding, and will perhaps be\nable to make a fair fight with the cocks who can crow so loudly on\ntheir own dunghills.\n\nThe judge in this case did his work with admirable skill, blowing\naside the froth of Mr. Furnival's eloquence, and upsetting the\nsophistry and false deductions of Mr. Chaffanbrass. The case for the\njury, as he said, hung altogether upon the evidence of Kenneby and\nthe woman Bolster. As far as he could see, the evidence of Dockwrath\nhad little to do with it; and alleged malice and greed on the part of\nDockwrath could have nothing to do with it. The jury might take it\nas proved that Lady Mason at the former trial had sworn that she\nhad been present when her husband signed the codicil and had seen\nthe different signatures affixed to it. They might also take it\nas proved, that that other deed,--the deed purporting to close a\npartnership between Sir Joseph Mason and Mr. Martock,--had been\nexecuted on the 14th of July, and that it had been signed by Sir\nJoseph, and also by those two surviving witnesses, Kenneby and\nBolster. The question, therefore, for the consideration of the jury\nhad narrowed itself to this: had two deeds been executed by Sir\nJoseph Mason, both bearing the same date? If this had not been done,\nand if that deed with reference to the partnership were a true\ndeed, then must the other be false and fraudulent; and if false and\nfraudulent, then must Lady Mason have sworn falsely, and been guilty\nof that perjury with which she was now charged. There might, perhaps,\nbe one loophole to this argument by which an escape was possible.\nThough both deeds bore the date of 14th July, there might have been\nerror in this. It was possible, though no doubt singular, that that\ndate should have been inserted in the partnership deed, and the deed\nitself be executed afterwards. But then the woman Bolster told them\nthat she had been called to act as witness but once in her life, and\nif they believed her in that statement, the possibility of error as\nto the date would be of little or no avail on behalf of Lady Mason.\nFor himself, he could not say that adequate ground had been shown\nfor charging Bolster with swearing falsely. No doubt she had been\nobstinate in her method of giving her testimony, but that might have\narisen from an honest resolution on her part not to allow herself to\nbe shaken. The value of her testimony must, however, be judged by\nthe jury themselves. As regarded Kenneby, he must say that the man\nhad been very stupid. No one who had heard him would accuse him for\na moment of having intended to swear falsely, but the jury might\nperhaps think that the testimony of such a man could not be taken as\nhaving much value with reference to circumstances which happened more\nthan twenty years since.\n\nThe charge took over two hours, but the substance of it has been\nstated. Then the jury retired to consider their verdict, and the\njudge, and the barristers, and some other jury proceeded to the\nbusiness of some other and less important trial. Lady Mason and Mrs.\nOrme sat for a while in their seats--perhaps for a space of twenty\nminutes--and then, as the jury did not at once return into court,\nthey retired to the sitting-room in which they had first been placed.\nHere Mr. Aram accompanied them, and here they were of course met by\nPeregrine Orme.\n\n\"His lordship's charge was very good--very good, indeed,\" said Mr.\nAram.\n\n\"Was it?\" asked Peregrine.\n\n\"And very much in our favour,\" continued the attorney.\n\n\"You think then,\" said Mrs. Orme, looking up into his face, \"you\nthink that--\" But she did not know how to go on with her question.\n\n\"Yes, I do. I think we shall have a verdict; I do, indeed. I would\nnot say so before Lady Mason if my opinion was not very strong. The\njury may disagree. That is not improbable. But I cannot anticipate\nthat the verdict will be against us.\"\n\nThere was some comfort in this; but how wretched was the nature of\nthe comfort! Did not the attorney, in every word which he spoke,\ndeclare his own conviction of his client's guilt. Even Peregrine Orme\ncould not say out boldly that he felt sure of an acquittal because\nno other verdict could be justly given. And then why was not Mr.\nFurnival there, taking his friend by the hand and congratulating her\nthat her troubles were so nearly over? Mr. Furnival at this time did\nnot come near her; and had he done so, what could he have said to\nher?\n\nHe and Sir Richard Leatherham left the court together, and the latter\nwent at once back to London without waiting to hear the verdict. Mr.\nChaffanbrass also, and Felix Graham retired from the scene of their\nlabours, and as they did so, a few words were spoken between them.\n\n\"Mr. Graham,\" said the ancient hero of the Old Bailey, \"you are too\ngreat for this kind of work I take it. If I were you, I would keep\nout of it for the future.\"\n\n\"I am very much of the same way of thinking, Mr. Chaffanbrass,\" said\nthe other.\n\n\"If a man undertakes a duty, he should do it. That's my opinion,\nthough I confess it's a little old fashioned; especially if he takes\nmoney for it, Mr. Graham.\" And then the old man glowered at him with\nhis fierce eyes, and nodded his head and went on. What could Graham\nsay to him? His answer would have been ready enough had there been\ntime or place in which to give it. But he had no answer ready\nwhich was fit for the crowded hall of the court-house, and so Mr.\nChaffanbrass went on his way. He will now pass out of our sight,\nand we will say of him, that he did his duty well according to his\nlights.\n\nThere, in that little room, sat Lady Mason and Mrs. Orme till late in\nthe evening, and there, with them, remained Peregrine. Some sort of\nrefreshment was procured for them, but of the three days they passed\nin the court, that, perhaps, was the most oppressive. There was\nno employment for them, and then the suspense was terrible! That\nsuspense became worse and worse as the hours went on, for it was\nclear that at any rate some of the jury were anxious to give a\nverdict against her. \"They say that there's eight and four,\" said Mr.\nAram, at one of the many visits which he made to them; \"but there's\nno saying how true that may be.\"\n\n\"Eight and four!\" said Peregrine.\n\n\"Eight to acquit, and four for guilty,\" said Aram. \"If so, we're\nsafe, at any rate, till the next assizes.\"\n\nBut it was not fated that Lady Mason should be sent away from the\ncourt in doubt. At eight o'clock Mr. Aram came to them, hot with\nhaste, and told them that the jury had sent for the judge. The judge\nhad gone home to his dinner, but would return to court at once when\nhe heard that the jury had agreed.\n\n\"And must we go into court again?\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Lady Mason must do so.\"\n\n\"Then of course I shall go with her. Are you ready now, dear?\"\n\nLady Mason was unable to speak, but she signified that she was ready,\nand then they went into court. The jury were already in the box, and\nas the two ladies took their seats, the judge entered. But few of the\ngas-lights were lit, so that they in the court could hardly see each\nother, and the remaining ceremony did not take five minutes.\n\n\"Not guilty, my lord,\" said the foreman. Then the verdict was\nrecorded, and the judge went back to his dinner. Joseph Mason and\nDockwrath were present and heard the verdict. I will leave the reader\nto imagine with what an appetite they returned to their chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI.\n\nI LOVE HER STILL.\n\n\nIt was all over now, and as Lucius had said to his mother, there was\nnothing left for them but to go and hide themselves. The verdict had\nreached him before his mother's return, and on the moment of his\nhearing it he sat down and commenced the following letter to Mr.\nFurnival:--\n\n\n   Orley Farm, March --, 18--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,\n\n   I beg to thank you, in my mother's name, for your great\n   exertions in the late trial. I must acknowledge that I\n   have been wrong in thinking that you gave her bad advice,\n   and am now convinced that you acted with the best judgment\n   on her behalf. May I beg that you will add to your great\n   kindness by inducing the gentlemen who undertook the\n   management of the case as my mother's attorneys to let\n   me know as soon as possible in what sum I am indebted to\n   them?\n\n   I believe I need trouble you with no preamble as to my\n   reasons when I tell you that I have resolved to abandon\n   immediately any title that I may have to the possession of\n   Orley Farm, and to make over the property at once, in any\n   way that may be most efficacious, to my half-brother,\n   Mr. Joseph Mason, of Groby Park. I so strongly feel the\n   necessity of doing this at once, without even a day's\n   delay, that I shall take my mother to lodgings in London\n   to-morrow, and shall then decide on what steps it may be\n   best that we shall take. My mother will be in possession\n   of about \u00c2\u00a3200 a year, subject to such deduction as the\n   cost of the trial may make from it.\n\n   I hope that you will not think that I intrude upon you\n   too far when I ask you to communicate with my brother's\n   lawyers on the subject of this surrender. I do not know\n   how else to do it; and of course you will understand that\n   I wish to screen my mother's name as much as may be in my\n   power with due regard to honesty. I hope I need not insist\n   on the fact,--for it is a fact,--that nothing will change\n   my purpose as to this. If I cannot have it done through\n   you, I must myself go to Mr. Round. I am, moreover, aware\n   that in accordance with strict justice my brother should\n   have upon me a claim for the proceeds of the estate since\n   the date of our father's death. If he wishes it I will\n   give him such claim, making myself his debtor by any\n   form that may be legal. He must, however, in such case\n   be made to understand that his claim will be against a\n   beggar; but, nevertheless, it may suit his views to have\n   such a claim upon me. I cannot think that, under the\n   circumstances, I should be justified in calling on my\n   mother to surrender her small income; but should you be of\n   a different opinion, it shall be done.\n\n   I write thus to you at once as I think that not a day\n   should be lost. I will trouble you with another line from\n   London, to let you know what is our immediate address.\n\n   Pray believe me to be\n   Yours, faithfully and obliged,\n\n   LUCIUS MASON.\n\n   T. Furnival, Esq.,\n   Old Square, Lincoln's Inn Fields.\n\n\nAs soon as he had completed this letter, which was sufficiently good\nfor its purpose, and clearly explained what was the writer's will on\nthe subject of it, he wrote another, which I do not think was equally\nefficacious. The second was addressed to Miss Furnival, and being\na love letter, was not so much within the scope of the writer's\npeculiar powers.\n\n\n   DEAREST SOPHIA,\n\n   I hardly know how to address you; or what I should tell\n   you or what conceal. Were we together, and was that\n   promise renewed which you once gave me, I should tell you\n   all;--but this I cannot do by letter. My mother's trial is\n   over, and she is acquitted; but that which I have learned\n   during the trial has made me feel that I am bound to\n   relinquish to my brother-in-law all my title to Orley\n   Farm, and I have already taken the first steps towards\n   doing so. Yes, Sophia, I am now a beggar on the face of\n   the world. I have nothing belonging to me, save those\n   powers of mind and body which God has given me; and I am,\n   moreover, a man oppressed with a terribly heavy load of\n   grief. For some short time I must hide myself with my\n   mother; and then, when I shall have been able to brace\n   my mind to work, I shall go forth and labour in whatever\n   field may be open to me.\n\n   But before I go, Sophia, I wish to say a word of farewell\n   to you, that I may understand on what terms we part. Of\n   course I make no claim. I am aware that that which I now\n   tell you must be held as giving you a valid excuse for\n   breaking any contract that there may have been between\n   us. But, nevertheless, I have hope. That I love you very\n   dearly I need hardly now say; and I still venture to think\n   that the time may come when I shall again prove myself\n   to be worthy of your hand. If you have ever loved me you\n   cannot cease to do so merely because I am unfortunate; and\n   if you love me still, perhaps you will consent to wait. If\n   you will do so,--if you will say that I am rich in that\n   respect,--I shall go to my banishment not altogether a\n   downcast man.\n\n   May I say that I am still your own\n\n   LUCIUS MASON?\n\n\nNo; he decidedly might not say so. But as the letter was not\nyet finished when his mother and Mrs. Orme returned, I will not\nanticipate matters by giving Miss Furnival's reply.\n\nMrs. Orme came back that night to Orley Farm, but without the\nintention of remaining there. Her task was over, and it would be well\nthat she should return to The Cleeve. Her task was over; and as the\nhour must come in which she would leave the mother in the hands of\nher son, the present hour would be as good as any.\n\nThey again went together to the room which they had shared for the\nlast night or two, and there they parted. They had not been there\nlong when the sound of wheels was heard on the gravel, and Mrs. Orme\ngot up from her seat. \"There is Peregrine with the carriage,\" said\nshe.\n\n\"And you are going?\" said Lady Mason.\n\n\"If I could do you good, I would stay,\" said Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"No, no; of course you must go. Oh, my darling, oh, my friend,\" and\nshe threw herself into the other's arms.\n\n\"Of course I will write to you,\" said Mrs. Orme. \"I will do so\nregularly.\"\n\n\"May God bless you for ever. But it is needless to ask for blessings\non such as you. You are blessed.\"\n\n\"And you too;--if you will turn to Him you will be blessed.\"\n\n\"Ah me. Well, I can try now. I feel that I can at any rate try.\"\n\n\"And none who try ever fail. And now, dear, good-bye.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my angel. But, Mrs. Orme, I have one word I must first\nsay; a message that I must send to him. Tell him this, that never in\nmy life have I loved any man as well as I have loved him and as I do\nlove him. That on my knees I beg his pardon for the wrong I have done\nhim.\"\n\n\"But he knows how great has been your goodness to him.\"\n\n\"When the time came I was not quite a devil to drag him down with me\nto utter destruction!\"\n\n\"He will always remember what was your conduct then.\"\n\n\"But tell him, that though I loved him, and though I loved you with\nall my heart,--with all my heart, I knew through it all, as I know\nnow, that I was not a fitting friend for him or you. No; do not\ninterrupt me, I always knew it; and though it was so sweet to me to\nsee your faces, I would have kept away; but that he would not have\nit. I came to him to assist me because he was great and strong, and\nhe took me to his bosom with his kindness, till I destroyed his\nstrength; though his greatness nothing can destroy.\"\n\n\"No, no; he does not think that you have injured him.\"\n\n\"But tell him what I say; and tell him that a poor bruised, broken\ncreature, who knows at least her own vileness, will pray for him\nnight and morning. And now good-bye. Of my heart towards you I cannot\nspeak.\"\n\n\"Good-bye then, and, Lady Mason, never despair. There is always room\nfor hope; and where there is hope there need not be unhappiness.\"\n\nThen they parted, and Mrs. Orme went down to her son.\n\n\"Mother, the carriage is here,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes, I heard it. Where is Lucius? Good-bye, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"God bless you, Mrs. Orme. Believe me I know how good you have been\nto us.\"\n\nAs she gave him her hand, she spoke a few words to him. \"My last\nrequest to you, Mr. Mason, is to beg that you will be tender to your\nmother.\"\n\n\"I will do my best, Mrs. Orme.\"\n\n\"All her sufferings and your own, have come from her great love for\nyou.\"\n\n\"That I know and feel, but had her ambition for me been less it would\nhave been better for both of us.\" And there he stood bare-headed at\nthe door while Peregrine Orme handed his mother into the carriage.\nThus Mrs. Orme took her last leave of Orley Farm, and was parted from\nthe woman she had loved with so much truth and befriended with so\nmuch loyalty.\n\nVery few words were spoken in the carriage between Peregrine and\nhis mother while they were being taken back through Hamworth to The\nCleeve. To Peregrine the whole matter was unintelligible. He knew\nthat the verdict had been in favour of Lady Mason, and yet there\nhad been no signs of joy at Orley Farm, or even of contentment. He\nhad heard also from Lucius, while they had been together for a few\nminutes, that Orley Farm was to be given up.\n\n\"You'll let it I suppose,\" Peregrine had asked.\n\n\"It will not be mine to let. It will belong to my brother,\" Lucius\nhad answered. Then Peregrine had asked no further question; nor had\nLucius offered any further information.\n\nBut his mother, as he knew, was worn out with the work she had done,\nand at the present moment he felt that the subject was one which\nwould hardly bear questions. So he sat by her side in silence; and\nbefore the carriage had reached The Cleeve his mind had turned away\nfrom the cares and sorrows of Lady Mason, and was once more at\nNoningsby. After all, as he said to himself, who could be worse off\nthan he was. He had nothing to hope.\n\nThey found Sir Peregrine standing in the hall to receive them, and\nMrs. Orme, though she had been absent only three days, could not but\nperceive the havoc which this trial had made upon him. It was not\nthat the sufferings of those three days had broken him down, but that\nnow, after that short absence, she was able to perceive how great had\nbeen upon him the effect of his previous sufferings. He had never\nheld up his head since the day on which Lady Mason had made to him\nher first confession. Up to that time he had stood erect, and though\nas he walked his steps had shown that he was no longer young, he\nhad walked with a certain air of strength and manly bearing. Till\nLady Mason had come to The Cleeve no one would have said that Sir\nPeregrine looked as though his energy and life had passed away. But\nnow, as he put his arm round his daughter's waist, and stooped down\nto kiss her cheek, he was a worn-out, tottering old man.\n\nDuring these three days he had lived almost altogether alone, and had\nbeen ashamed to show to those around him the intense interest which\nhe felt in the result of the trial. His grandson had on each day\nbreakfasted alone, and had left the house before his grandfather was\nout of his room; and on each evening he had returned late,--as he\nnow returned with his mother,--and had dined alone. Then he had sat\nwith his grandfather for an hour or two, and had been constrained\nto talk over the events of the day without being allowed to ask Sir\nPeregrine's opinion as to Lady Mason's innocence or to express his\nown. These three days had been dreadful to Sir Peregrine. He had not\nleft the house, but had crept about from room to room, ever and again\ntaking up some book or paper and putting it down unread, as his mind\nreverted to the one subject which now for him bore any interest. On\nthe second of these three days a note had been brought to him from\nhis old friend Lord Alston. \"Dear Orme,\" the note had run, \"I am not\nquite happy as I think of the manner in which we parted the other\nday. If I offended in any degree, I send this as a peacemaker, and\nbeg to shake your hand heartily. Let me have a line from you to say\nthat it is all right between us. Neither you nor I can afford to\nlose an old friend at our time of life. Yours always, Alston.\" But\nSir Peregrine had not answered it. Lord Alston's servant had been\ndismissed with a promise that an answer should be sent, but at the\nend of the three days it had not yet been written. His mind indeed\nwas still sore towards Lord Alston. The counsel which his old friend\nhad given him was good and true, but it had been neglected, and its\nvery truth and excellence now made the remembrance of it unpalatable.\nHe had, nevertheless, intended to write; but the idea of such\nexertion from hour to hour had become more distressing to him.\n\nHe had of course heard of Lady Mason's acquittal; and indeed tidings\nof the decision to which the jury had come went through the country\nvery quickly. There is a telegraphic wire for such tidings which has\nbeen very long in use, and which, though always used, is as yet but\nvery little understood. How is it that information will spread itself\nquicker than men can travel, and make its way like water into all\nparts of the world? It was known all through the country that night\nthat Lady Mason was acquitted; and before the next night it was as\nwell known that she had acknowledged her guilt by giving up the\nproperty.\n\nLittle could be said as to the trial while Peregrine remained in the\nroom with his mother and his grandfather; but this he had the tact to\nperceive, and soon left them together. \"I shall see you, mother, up\nstairs before you go to bed,\" he said as he sauntered out.\n\n\"But you must not keep her up,\" said his grandfather. \"Remember all\nthat she has gone through.\" With this injunction he went off, and as\nhe sat alone in his mother's room he tried to come to some resolution\nas to Noningsby. He knew he had no ground for hope;--no chance, as\nhe would have called it. And if so, would it not be better that\nhe should take himself off? Nevertheless he would go to Noningsby\nonce more. He would not be such a coward but that he would wish her\ngood-bye before he went, and hear the end of it all from her own\nlips.\n\nWhen he had left the room Lady Mason's last message was given to Sir\nPeregrine. \"Poor soul, poor soul!\" he said, as Mrs. Orme began her\nstory. \"Her son knows it all then now.\"\n\n\"I told him last night,--with her consent; so that he should not go\ninto the court to-day. It would have been very bad, you know, if they\nhad--found her guilty.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; very bad--very bad indeed. Poor creature! And so you told\nhim. How did he bear it?\"\n\n\"On the whole, well. At first he would not believe me.\"\n\n\"As for me, I could not have done it. I could not have told him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, you would;--you would, if it had been required of you.\"\n\n\"I think it would have killed me. But a woman can do things for which\na man's courage would never be sufficient. And he bore it manfully.\"\n\n\"He was very stern.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and he will be stern. Poor soul!--I pity her from my very\nheart. But he will not desert her; he will do his duty by her.\"\n\n\"I am sure he will. In that respect he is a good young man.\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. He is one of those who seem by nature created to bear\nadversity. No trouble or sorrow would I think crush him. But had\nprosperity come to him, it would have made him odious to all around\nhim. You were not present when they met?\"\n\n\"No--I thought it better to leave them.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes. And he will give up the place at once.\"\n\n\"To-morrow he will do so. In that at any rate he has true spirit.\nTo-morrow early they will go to London, and she I suppose will never\nsee Orley Farm again.\" And then Mrs. Orme gave Sir Peregrine that\nlast message.--\"I tell you everything as she told me,\" Mrs. Orme\nsaid, seeing how deeply he was affected. \"Perhaps I am wrong.\"\n\n\"No, no, no,\" he said.\n\n\"Coming at such a moment, her words seemed to be almost sacred.\"\n\n\"They are sacred. They shall be sacred. Poor soul, poor soul!\"\n\n\"She did a great crime.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"But if a crime can be forgiven,--can be excused on account of its\nmotives--\"\n\n\"It cannot, my dear. Nothing can be forgiven on that ground.\"\n\n\"No; we know that; we all feel sure of that. But yet how can one help\nloving her? For myself, I shall love her always.\"\n\n\"And I also love her.\" And then the old man made his confession.\n\"I loved her well;--better than I had ever thought to love any one\nagain, but you and Perry. I loved her very dearly, and felt that I\nshould have been proud to have called her my wife. How beautiful she\nwas in her sorrow, when we thought that her life had been pure and\ngood!\"\n\n\"And it had been good,--for many years past.\"\n\n\"No; for the stolen property was still there. But yet how graceful\nshe was, and how well her sorrows sat upon her! What might she not\nhave done had the world used her more kindly, and not sent in her\nway that sore temptation! She was a woman for a man to have loved to\nmadness.\"\n\n\"And yet how little can she have known of love!\"\n\n\"I loved her.\" And as the old man said so he rose to his feet with\nsome show of his old energy. \"I loved her,--with all my heart! It is\nfoolish for an old man so to say; but I did love her; nay, I love her\nstill. But that I knew that it would be wrong,--for your sake, and\nfor Perry's--\" And then he stopped himself, as though he would fain\nhear what she might say to him.\n\n\"Yes; it is all over now,\" she said in the softest, sweetest, lowest\nvoice. She knew that she was breaking down a last hope, but she knew\nalso that that hope was vain. And then there was silence in the room\nfor some ten minutes' space.\n\n\"It is all over,\" he then said, repeating her last words.\n\n\"But you have us still,--Perry and me. Can any one love you better\nthan we do?\" And she got up and went over to him and stood by him,\nand leaned upon him.\n\n\"Edith, my love, since you came to my house there has been an angel\nin it watching over me. I shall know that always; and when I turn\nmy face to the wall, as I soon shall, that shall be my last earthly\nthought.\" And so in tears they parted for that night. But the sorrow\nthat was bringing him to his grave came from the love of which he had\nspoken. It is seldom that a young man may die from a broken heart;\nbut if an old man have a heart still left to him, it is more fragile.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII.\n\nJOHN KENNEBY'S DOOM.\n\n\nOn the evening but one after the trial was over Mr. Moulder\nentertained a few friends to supper at his apartments in Great St.\nHelen's, and it was generally understood that in doing so he intended\nto celebrate the triumph of Lady Mason. Through the whole affair he\nhad been a strong partisan on her side, had expressed a very loud\nopinion in favour of Mr. Furnival, and had hoped that that scoundrel\nDockwrath would get all that he deserved from the hands of Mr.\nChaffanbrass. When the hour of Mr. Dockwrath's punishment had come he\nhad been hardly contented, but the inadequacy of Kenneby's testimony\nhad restored him to good humour, and the verdict had made him\ntriumphant.\n\n\"Didn't I know it, old fellow?\" he had said, slapping his friend\nSnengkeld on the back. \"When such a low scoundrel as Dockwrath is\npitted against a handsome woman like Lady Mason he'll not find a jury\nin England to give a verdict in his favour.\" Then he asked Snengkeld\nto come to his little supper; and Kantwise also he invited, though\nKantwise had shown Dockwrath tendencies throughout the whole\naffair;--but Moulder was fond of Kantwise as a butt for his own\nsarcasm. Mrs. Smiley, too, was asked, as was natural, seeing that she\nwas the betrothed bride of one of the heroes of the day; and Moulder,\nin the kindness of his heart, swore that he never was proud, and told\nBridget Bolster that she would be welcome to take a share of what was\ngoing.\n\n\"Laws, M.,\" said Mrs. Moulder, when she was told of this. \"A\nchambermaid from an inn! What will Mrs. Smiley say?\"\n\n\"I ain't going to trouble myself with what Mother Smiley may say or\nthink about my friends. If she don't like it, she may do the other\nthing. What was she herself when you first knew her?\"\n\n\"Yes, Moulder; but then money do make a difference, you know.\"\n\nBridget Bolster, however, was invited, and she came in spite of the\ngrandeur of Mrs. Smiley. Kenneby also of course was there, but he was\nnot in a happy frame of mind. Since that wretched hour in which he\nhad heard himself described by the judge as too stupid to be held\nof any account by the jury he had become a melancholy, misanthropic\nman. The treatment which he received from Mr. Furnival had been very\ngrievous to him, but he had borne with that, hoping that some word of\neulogy from the judge would set him right in the public mind. But no\nsuch word had come, and poor John Kenneby felt that the cruel hard\nworld was too much for him. He had been with his sister that morning,\nand words had dropped from him which made her fear that he would\nwish to postpone his marriage for another space of ten years or so.\n\"Brick-fields!\" he had said. \"What can such a one as I have to do\nwith landed property? I am better as I am.\"\n\nMrs. Smiley, however, did not at all seem to think so, and welcomed\nJohn Kenneby back from Alston very warmly in spite of the disgrace to\nwhich he had been subjected. It was nothing to her that the judge had\ncalled her future lord a fool; nor indeed was it anything to any one\nbut himself. According to Moulder's views it was a matter of course\nthat a witness should be abused. For what other purpose was he had\ninto the court? But deep in the mind of poor Kenneby himself the\ninjurious words lay festering. He had struggled hard to tell the\ntruth, and in doing so had simply proved himself to be an ass. \"I\nain't fit to live with anybody else but myself,\" he said to himself,\nas he walked down Bishopsgate Street.\n\nAt this time Mrs. Smiley was not yet there. Bridget had arrived, and\nhad been seated in a chair at one corner of the fire. Mrs. Moulder\noccupied one end of a sofa opposite, leaving the place of honour at\nthe other end for Mrs. Smiley. Moulder sat immediately in front of\nthe fire in his own easy chair, and Snengkeld and Kantwise were on\neach side of him. They were of course discussing the trial when Mrs.\nSmiley was announced; and it was well that she made a diversion by\nher arrival, for words were beginning to run high.\n\n\"A jury of her countrymen has found her innocent,\" Moulder had said\nwith much heat; \"and any one who says she's guilty after that is\na libeller and a coward, to my way of thinking. If a jury of her\ncountrymen don't make a woman innocent, what does?\"\n\n\"Of course she's innocent,\" said Snengkeld; \"from the very moment\nthe words was spoken by the foreman. If any newspaper was to say she\nwasn't she'd have her action.\"\n\n\"That's all very well,\" said Kantwise, looking up to the ceiling\nwith his eyes nearly shut. \"But you'll see. What'll you bet me, Mr.\nMoulder, that Joseph Mason don't get the property?\"\n\n\"Gammon!\" answered Moulder.\n\n\"Well, it may be gammon; but you'll see.\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" said Mrs. Smiley, sailing into the room;\n\"upon my word one hears all you say ever so far down the street.\"\n\n\"And I didn't care if they heard it right away to the Mansion House,\"\nsaid Moulder. \"We ain't talking treason, nor yet highway robbery.\"\n\nThen Mrs. Smiley was welcomed;--her bonnet was taken from her and her\numbrella, and she was encouraged to spread herself out over the sofa.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Bolster; the witness!\" she said, when Mrs. Moulder went\nthrough some little ceremony of introduction. And from the tone of\nher voice it appeared that she was not quite satisfied that Mrs.\nBolster should be there as a companion for herself.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. I was the witness as had never signed but once,\" said\nBridget, getting up and curtsying. Then she sat down again, folding\nher hands one over the other on her lap.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"But where's the other witness, Mrs.\nMoulder? He's the one who is a deal more interesting to me. Ha, ha,\nha! But as you all know it here, what's the good of not telling the\ntruth? Ha, ha, ha!\"\n\n\"John's here,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"Come, John, why don't you show\nyourself?\"\n\n\"He's just alive, and that's about all you can say for him,\" said\nMoulder.\n\n\"Why, what's there been to kill him?\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"Well, John,\nI must say you're rather backward in coming forward, considering what\nthere's been between us. You might have come and taken my shawl, I'm\nthinking.\"\n\n\"Yes, I might,\" said Kenneby gloomily. \"I hope I see you pretty well,\nMrs. Smiley.\"\n\n\"Pretty bobbish, thank you. Only I think it might have been Maria\nbetween friends like us.\"\n\n\"He's sadly put about by this trial,\" whispered Mrs. Moulder. \"You\nknow he is so tender-hearted that he can't bear to be put upon like\nanother.\"\n\n\"But you didn't want her to be found guilty; did you, John?\"\n\n\"That I'm sure he didn't,\" said Moulder. \"Why it was the way he gave\nhis evidence that brought her off.\"\n\n\"It wasn't my wish to bring her off,\" said Kenneby; \"nor was it my\nwish to make her guilty. All I wanted was to tell the truth and do my\nduty. But it was no use. I believe it never is any use.\"\n\n\"I think you did very well,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"I'm sure Lady Mason ought to be very much obliged to you,\" said\nKantwise.\n\n\"Nobody needn't care for what's said to them in a court,\" said\nSnengkeld. \"I remember when once they wanted to make out that I'd\ntaken a parcel of teas--\"\n\n\"Stolen, you mean, sir,\" suggested Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"Yes; stolen. But it was only done by the opposite side in court, and\nI didn't think a halfporth of it. They knew where the teas was well\nenough.\"\n\n\"Speaking for myself,\" said Kenneby, \"I must say I don't like it.\"\n\n\"But the paper as we signed,\" said Bridget, \"wasn't the old\ngentleman's will,--no more than this is;\" and she lifted up her\napron. \"I'm rightly sure of that.\"\n\nThen again the battle raged hot and furious, and Moulder became angry\nwith his guest, Bridget Bolster. Kantwise finding himself supported\nin his views by the principal witness at the trial took heart\nagainst the tyranny of Moulder and expressed his opinion, while Mrs.\nSmiley, with a woman's customary dislike to another woman, sneered\nill-naturedly at the idea of Lady Mason's innocence. Poor Kenneby had\nbeen forced to take the middle seat on the sofa between his bride and\nsister; but it did not appear that the honour of his position had\nany effect in lessening his gloom or mitigating the severity of the\njudgment which had been passed on him.\n\n\"Wasn't the old gentleman's will!\" said Moulder, turning on poor\nBridget in his anger with a growl. \"But I say it was the old\ngentleman's will. You never dared say as much as that in court.\"\n\n\"I wasn't asked,\" said Bridget.\n\n\"You weren't asked! Yes, you was asked often enough.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is,\" said Kantwise, \"Mrs. Bolster's right in\nwhat she says as sure as your name's Moulder.\"\n\n\"Then as sure as my name's Moulder she's wrong. I suppose we're to\nthink that a chap like you knows more about it than the jury! We all\nknow who your friend is in the matter. I haven't forgot our dinner at\nLeeds, nor sha'n't in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Now, John,\" said Mrs. Smiley, \"nobody can know the truth of this so\nwell as you do. You've been as close as wax, as was all right till\nthe lady was out of her troubles. That's done and over, and let us\nhear among friends how the matter really was.\" And then there was\nsilence among them in order that his words might come forth freely.\n\n\"Come, my dear,\" said Mrs. Smiley with a tone of encouraging love.\n\"There can't be any harm now; can there?\"\n\n\"Out with it, John,\" said Moulder. \"You're honest, anyways.\"\n\n\"There ain't no gammon about you,\" said Snengkeld.\n\n\"Mr. Kenneby can speak if he likes, no doubt,\" said Kantwise; \"though\nmaybe it mayn't be very pleasant to him to do so after all that's\ncome and gone.\"\n\n\"There's nothing that's come and gone that need make our John hold\nhis tongue,\" said Mrs. Moulder. \"He mayn't be just as bright as some\nof those lawyers, but he's a deal more true-hearted.\"\n\n\"But he can't say as how it was the old gentleman's will as we\nsigned. I'm well assured of that,\" said Bridget.\n\nBut Kenneby, though thus called upon by the united strength of the\ncompany to solve all their doubts, still remained silent. \"Come,\nlovey,\" said Mrs. Smiley, putting forth her hand and giving his arm a\ntender squeeze.\n\n\"If you've anything to say to clear that woman's character,\" said\nMoulder, \"you owe it to society to say it; because she is a woman,\nand because her enemies is villains.\" And then again there was\nsilence while they waited for him.\n\n\"I think it will go with him to his grave,\" said Mrs. Smiley, very\nsolemnly.\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder,\" said Snengkeld.\n\n\"Then he must give up all idea of taking a wife,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"He won't do that I'm sure,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"That he won't. Will you, John?\" said his sister.\n\n\"There's no knowing what may happen to me in this world,\" said\nKenneby, \"but sometimes I almost think I ain't fit to live in it,\nalong with anybody else.\"\n\n\"You'll make him fit, won't you, my dear?\" said Mrs. Moulder.\n\n\"I don't exactly know what to say about it,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"If\nMr. Kenneby ain't willing, I'm not the woman to bind him to his word,\nbecause I've had his promise over and over again, and could prove\nit by a number of witnesses before any jury in the land. I'm an\nindependent woman as needn't be beholden to any man, and I should\nnever think of damages. Smiley left me comfortable before all the\nworld, and I don't know but what I'm a fool to think of changing.\nAnyways if Mr. Kenneby--\"\n\n\"Come, John. Why don't you speak to her?\" said Mrs. Moulder.\n\n\"And what am I to say?\" said Kenneby, thrusting himself forth from\nbetween the ample folds of the two ladies' dresses. \"I'm a blighted\nman; one on whom the finger of scorn has been pointed. His lordship\nsaid that I was--stupid; and perhaps I am.\"\n\n\"She don't think nothing of that, John.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"As long as a man can pay twenty shillings in the pound and a trifle\nover, what does it matter if all the judges in the land was to call\nhim stupid?\" said Snengkeld.\n\n\"Stupid is as stupid does,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"Stupid be d----,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"Mr. Moulder, there's ladies present,\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"Come, John, rouse yourself a bit,\" said his sister. \"Nobody here\nthinks the worse of you for what the judge said.\"\n\n\"Certainly not,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"And as it becomes me to speak,\nI'll say my mind. I'm accustomed to speak freely before friends, and\nas we are all friends here, why should I be ashamed?\"\n\n\"For the matter of that nobody says you are,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"And I don't mean, Mr. Moulder. Why should I? I can pay my way, and\ndo what I like with my own, and has people to mind me when I speak,\nand needn't mind nobody else myself;--and that's more than everybody\ncan say. Here's John Kenneby and I, is engaged as man and wife. He\nwon't say as it's not so, I'll be bound.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Kenneby, \"I'm engaged I know.\"\n\n\"When I accepted John Kenneby's hand and heart,--and well I remember\nthe beauteous language in which he expressed his feelings, and always\nshall,--I told him, that I respected him as a man that would do his\nduty by a woman, though perhaps he mightn't be so cute in the way\nof having much to say for himself as some others. 'What's the good,'\nsaid I, 'of a man's talking, if so be he's ashamed to meet the baker\nat the end of the week?' So I listened to the vows he made me, and\nhave considered that he and I was as good as one. Now that he's been\nput upon by them lawyers, I'm not the woman to turn my back upon\nhim.\"\n\n\"That you're not,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"No I ain't, Mr. Moulder, and so, John, there's my hand again, and\nyou're free to take it if you like.\" And so saying she put forth her\nhand almost into his lap.\n\n\"Take it, John!\" said Mrs. Moulder. But poor Kenneby himself did not\nseem to be very quick in availing himself of the happiness offered to\nhim. He did raise his right arm slightly; but then he hesitated, and\nallowed it to fall again between him and his sister.\n\n\"Come, John, you know you mean it,\" said Mrs. Moulder. And then with\nboth her hands she lifted his, and placed it bodily within the grasp\nof Mrs. Smiley's, which was still held forth to receive it.\n\n\"I know I'm engaged,\" said Kenneby.\n\n\"There's no mistake about it,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"There needn't be none,\" said Mrs. Smiley, softly blushing; \"and I\nwill say this of myself--as I have been tempted to give a promise,\nI'm not the woman to go back from my word. There's my hand, John; and\nI don't care though all the world hears me say so.\" And then they sat\nhand in hand for some seconds, during which poor Kenneby was unable\nto escape from the grasp of his bride elect. One may say that all\nchance of final escape for him was now gone by.\n\n\"But he can't say as how it was the old gentlemen's will as we\nsigned,\" said Bridget, breaking the silence which ensued.\n\n\"And now, ladies and gentlemen,\" said Kantwise, \"as Mrs. Bolster has\ncome back to that matter, I'll tell you something that will surprise\nyou. My friend Mr. Moulder here, who is as hospitable a gentleman as\nI know anywhere wouldn't just let me speak before.\"\n\n\"That's gammon, Kantwise. I never hindered you from speaking.\"\n\n\"How I do hate that word. If you knew my aversion, Mr. Moulder--\"\n\n\"I can't pick my words for you, old fellow.\"\n\n\"But what were you going to tell us, Mr. Kantwise?\" said Mrs. Smiley.\n\n\"Something that will make all your hairs stand on end, I think.\" And\nthen he paused and looked round upon them all. It was at this moment\nthat Kenneby succeeded in getting his hand once more to himself.\n\"Something that will surprise you all, or I'm very much mistaken.\nLady Mason has confessed her guilt.\"\n\nHe had surprised them all. \"You don't say so,\" exclaimed Mrs.\nMoulder.\n\n\"Confessed her guilt,\" said Mrs. Smiley. \"But what guilt, Mr.\nKantwise?\"\n\n\"She forged the will,\" said Kantwise.\n\n\"I knew that all along,\" said Bridget Bolster.\n\n\"I'm d---- if I believe it,\" said Moulder.\n\n\"You can do as you like about that,\" said Kantwise; \"but she has.\nAnd I'll tell you what's more: she and young Mason have already left\nOrley Farm and given it all up into Joseph Mason's hands.\"\n\n\"But didn't she get a verdict?\" asked Snengkeld.\n\n\"Yes, she got a verdict. There's no doubt on earth about that.\"\n\n\"Then it's my opinion she can't make herself guilty if she wished it;\nand as for the property, she can't give it up. The jury has found a\nverdict, and nobody can go beyond that. If anybody tries she'll have\nher action against 'em.\" That was the law as laid down by Snengkeld.\n\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" said Moulder. \"Dockwrath has told\nhim. I'll bet a hat that Kantwise got it from Dockwrath.\"\n\nIt turned out that Kantwise had received his information from\nDockwrath; but nevertheless, there was that in his manner, and in the\nnature of the story as it was told to them, that did produce belief.\nMoulder for a long time held out, but it became clear at last that\neven he was shaken; and now, even Kenneby acknowledged his conviction\nthat the signature to the will was not his own.\n\n\"I know'd very well that I never did it twice,\" said Bridget Bolster\ntriumphantly, as she sat down to the supper table.\n\nI am inclined to think, that upon the whole the company in Great St.\nHelen's became more happy as the conviction grew upon them that a\ngreat and mysterious crime had been committed, which had baffled two\ncourts of law, and had at last thrust itself forth into the open\ndaylight through the workings of the criminal's conscience. When\nKantwise had completed his story, the time had come in which it\nbehoved Mrs. Moulder to descend to the lower regions, and give some\naid in preparation of the supper. During her absence the matter\nwas discussed in every way, and on her return, when she was laden\nwith good things, she found that all the party was contented except\nMoulder and her brother.\n\n\"It's a very terrible thing,\" said Mrs. Smiley, later in the evening,\nas she sat with her steaming glass of rum and water before her. \"Very\nterrible indeed; ain't it, John? I do wish now I'd gone down and\nsee'd her, I do indeed. Don't you, Mrs. Moulder?\"\n\n\"If all this is true I should like just to have had a peep at her.\"\n\n\"At any rate we shall have pictures of her in all the papers,\" said\nMrs. Smiley.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII.\n\nTHE LAST OF THE LAWYERS.\n\n\n\"I should have done my duty by you, Mr. Mason, which those men have\nnot, and you would at this moment have been the owner of Orley Farm.\"\n\nIt will easily be known that these words were spoken by Mr.\nDockwrath, and that they were addressed to Joseph Mason. The two\nmen were seated together in Mr. Mason's lodgings at Alston, late\non the morning after the verdict had been given, and Mr. Dockwrath\nwas speaking out his mind with sufficient freedom. On the previous\nevening he had been content to put up with the misery of the\nunsuccessful man, and had not added any reproaches of his own. He\nalso had been cowed by the verdict, and the two had been wretched and\ncrestfallen together. But the attorney since that had slept upon the\nmatter, and had bethought himself that he at any rate would make out\nhis little bill. He could show that Mr. Mason had ruined their joint\naffairs by his adherence to those London attorneys. Had Mr. Mason\nlistened to the advice of his new adviser all would have been well.\nSo at least Dockwrath was prepared to declare, finding that by so\ndoing he would best pave the way for his own important claim.\n\nBut Mr. Mason was not a man to be bullied with tame endurance. \"The\nfirm bears the highest name in the profession, sir,\" he said; \"and I\nhad just grounds for trusting them.\"\n\n\"And what has come of your just grounds, Mr. Mason? Where are you?\nThat's the question. I say that Round and Crook have thrown you over.\nThey have been hand and glove with old Furnival through the whole\ntransaction; and I'll tell you what's more, Mr. Mason. I told you how\nit would be from the beginning.\"\n\n\"I'll move for a new trial.\"\n\n\"A new trial; and this a criminal prosecution! She's free of you now\nfor ever, and Orley Farm will belong to that son of hers till he\nchooses to sell it. It's a pity; that's all. I did my duty by you\nin a professional way, Mr. Mason; and you won't put the loss on my\nshoulders.\"\n\n\"I've been robbed;--damnably robbed, that's all that I know.\"\n\n\"There's no mistake on earth about that, Mr. Mason; you have been\nrobbed; and the worst of it is, the costs will be so heavy! You'll be\ngoing down to Yorkshire soon I suppose, sir.\"\n\n\"I don't know where I shall go!\" said the squire of Groby, not\ncontent to be cross-questioned by the attorney from Hamworth.\n\n\"Because it's as well, I suppose, that we should settle something\nabout the costs before you leave. I don't want to press for my money\nexactly now, but I shall be glad to know when I'm to get it.\"\n\n\"If you have any claim on me, Mr. Dockwrath, you can send it to Mr.\nRound.\"\n\n\"If I have any claim! What do you mean by that, sir? And I shall\nsend nothing in to Mr. Round. I have had quite enough of Mr. Round\nalready. I told you from the beginning, Mr. Mason, that I would have\nnothing to do with this affair as connected with Mr. Round. I have\ndevoted myself entirely to this matter since you were pleased to\nengage my services at Groby Park. It is not by my fault that you have\nfailed. I think, Mr. Mason, you will do me the justice to acknowledge\nthat.\" And then Dockwrath was silent for a moment, as though waiting\nfor an answer.\n\n\"I have nothing to say upon the subject, Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Mason.\n\n\"But, by heaven, something must be said. That won't do at all, Mr.\nMason. I presume you do not think that I have been working like a\nslave for the last four months for nothing.\"\n\nMr. Mason was in truth an honest man, and did not wish that any one\nshould work on his account for nothing;--much less did he wish that\nsuch a one as Dockwrath should do so. But then, on the other side,\nin his present frame of mind he was by no means willing to yield\nanything to any one. \"I neither deny nor allow your claim, Mr.\nDockwrath,\" said he. \"But I shall pay nothing except through my\nregular lawyers. You can send your account to me if you please, but I\nshall send it on to Mr. Round without looking at it.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's to be the way, is it? That's your gratitude. Very well,\nMr. Mason; I shall now know what to do. And I think you'll find--\"\n\nHere Mr. Dockwrath was interrupted by the lodging-house servant, who\nbrought in a note for Mr. Mason. It was from Mr. Furnival, and the\ngirl who delivered it said that the gentleman's messenger was waiting\nfor an answer.\n\n\"SIR,\" said the note,\n\n\n   A communication has been made to me this morning on the\n   part of your brother, Mr. Lucius Mason, which may make\n   it desirable that I should have an interview with you.\n   If not inconvenient to you, I would ask you to meet me\n   to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock at the chambers of\n   your own lawyer, Mr. Round, in Bedford Row. I have\n   already seen Mr. Round, and find that he can meet us.\n\n   I am, sir,\n   Your very obedient servant,\n\n   THOMAS FURNIVAL.\n\n   J. Mason, Esq., J.P.\n   (of Groby Park).\n\n\nMr. Furnival when he wrote this note had already been over to Orley\nFarm, and had seen Lucius Mason. He had been at the farm almost\nbefore daylight, and had come away with the assured conviction that\nthe property must be abandoned by his client.\n\n\"We need not talk about it, Mr. Furnival,\" Lucius had said. \"It must\nbe so.\"\n\n\"You have discussed the matter with your mother?\"\n\n\"No discussion is necessary, but she is quite aware of my intention.\nShe is prepared to leave the place--for ever.\"\n\n\"But the income--\"\n\n\"Belongs to my brother Joseph. Mr. Furnival, I think you may\nunderstand that the matter is one in which it is necessary that I\nshould act, but as to which I trust I may not have to say many words.\nIf you cannot arrange this for me, I must go to Mr. Round.\"\n\nOf course Mr. Furnival did understand it all. His client had been\nacquitted, and he had triumphed; but he had known for many a long day\nthat the estate did belong of right to Mr. Mason of Groby; and though\nhe had not suspected that Lucius would have been so told, he could\nnot be surprised at the result of such telling. It was clear to him\nthat Lady Mason had confessed, and that restitution would therefore\nbe made.\n\n\"I will do your bidding,\" said he.\n\n\"And, Mr. Furnival,--if it be possible, spare my mother.\" Then the\nmeeting was over, and Mr. Furnival returning to Hamworth wrote his\nnote to Mr. Joseph Mason.\n\nMr. Dockwrath had been interrupted by the messenger in the middle\nof his threat, but he caught the name of Furnival as the note was\ndelivered. Then he watched Mr. Mason as he read it and read it again.\n\n\"If you please, sir, I was to wait for an answer,\" said the girl.\n\nMr. Mason did not know what answer it would behove him to give. He\nfelt that he was among Philistines while dealing with all these\nlawyers, and yet he was at a loss in what way to reply to one without\nleaning upon another. \"Look at that,\" he said, sulkily handing the\nnote to Dockwrath.\n\n\"You must see Mr. Furnival, by all means,\" said Dockwrath. \"But--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"In your place I should not see him in the presence of Mr.\nRound,--unless I was attended by an adviser on whom I could rely.\"\nMr. Mason, having given a few moments' consideration to the matter,\nsat himself down and wrote a line to Mr. Furnival, saying that he\nwould be in Bedford Row at the appointed time.\n\n\"I think you are quite right,\" said Dockwrath.\n\n\"But I shall go alone,\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"Oh, very well; you will of course judge for yourself. I cannot say\nwhat may be the nature of the communication to be made; but if it be\nanything touching the property, you will no doubt jeopardise your own\ninterests by your imprudence.\"\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Dockwrath,\" said Mr. Mason.\n\n\"Oh, very well. Good morning, sir. You shall hear from me very\nshortly, Mr. Mason; and I must say that, considering everything, I\ndo not know that I ever came across a gentleman who behaved himself\nworse in a peculiar position than you have done in yours.\" And so\nthey parted.\n\nPunctually at eleven o'clock on the following day Mr. Mason was in\nBedford Row. \"Mr. Furnival is with Mr. Round,\" said the clerk, \"and\nwill see you in two minutes.\" Then he was shown into the dingy office\nwaiting-room, where he sat with his hat in his hand, for rather more\nthan two minutes.\n\nAt that moment Mr. Round was describing to Mr. Furnival the manner\nin which he had been visited some weeks since by Sir Peregrine Orme.\n\"Of course, Mr. Furnival, I knew which way the wind blew when I heard\nthat.\"\n\n\"She must have told him everything.\"\n\n\"No doubt, no doubt. At any rate he knew it all.\"\n\n\"And what did you say to him?\"\n\n\"I promised to hold my tongue;--and I kept my promise. Mat knows\nnothing about it to this day.\"\n\nThe whole history thus became gradually clear to Mr. Furnival's\nmind, and he could understand in what manner that marriage had been\navoided. Mr. Round also understood it, and the two lawyers confessed\ntogether, that though the woman had deserved the punishment which had\ncome upon her, her character was one which might have graced a better\ndestiny. \"And now, I suppose, my fortunate client may come in,\" said\nMr. Round. Whereupon the fortunate client was released from his\ncaptivity, and brought into the sitting-room of the senior partner.\n\n\"Mr. Mason, Mr. Furnival,\" said the attorney, as soon as he had\nshaken hands with his client. \"You know each other very well by name,\ngentlemen.\"\n\nMr. Mason was very stiff in his bearing and demeanour, but remarked\nthat he had heard of Mr. Furnival before.\n\n\"All the world has heard of him,\" said Mr. Round. \"He hasn't hid\nhis light under a bushel.\" Whereupon Mr. Mason bowed, not quite\nunderstanding what was said to him.\n\n\"Mr. Mason,\" began the barrister, \"I have a communication to make to\nyou, very singular in its nature, and of great importance. It is one\nwhich I believe you will regard as being of considerable importance\nto yourself, and which is of still higher moment to my--my friend,\nLady Mason.\"\n\n\"Lady Mason, sir--\" began the other; but Mr. Furnival stopped him.\n\n\"Allow me to interrupt you, Mr. Mason. I think it will be better that\nyou should hear me before you commit yourself to any expression as to\nyour relative.\"\n\n\"She is no relative of mine.\"\n\n\"But her son is. However,--if you will allow me, I will go on. Having\nthis communication to make, I thought it expedient for your own sake\nthat it should be done in the presence of your own legal adviser and\nfriend.\"\n\n\"Umph!\" grunted the disappointed litigant.\n\n\"I have already explained to Mr. Round that which I am about to\nexplain to you, and he was good enough to express himself as\nsatisfied with the step which I am taking.\"\n\n\"Quite so, Mr. Mason. Mr. Furnival is behaving, and I believe has\nbehaved throughout, in a manner becoming the very high position which\nhe holds in his profession.\"\n\n\"I suppose he has done his best on his side,\" said Mason.\n\n\"Undoubtedly I have,--as I should have done on yours, had it so\nchanced that I had been honoured by holding a brief from your\nattorneys. But the communication which I am going to make now I make\nnot as a lawyer but as a friend. Mr. Mason, my client Lady Mason,\nand her son Lucius Mason, are prepared to make over to you the full\npossession of the estate which they have held under the name of Orley\nFarm.\"\n\nThe tidings, as so given, were far from conveying to the sense of the\nhearer the full information which they bore. He heard the words, and\nat the moment conceived that Orley Farm was intended to come into\nhis hands by some process to which it was thought desirable that\nhe should be brought to agree. He was to be induced to buy it, or\nto be bought over from further opposition by some concession of an\nindefinitely future title. But that the estate was to become his\nat once, without purchase, and by the mere free will of his hated\nrelatives, was an idea that he did not realise.\n\n\"Mr. Furnival,\" he said, \"what future steps I shall take I do not yet\nknow. That I have been robbed of my property I am as firmly convinced\nnow as ever. But I tell you fairly, and I tell Mr. Round so too, that\nI will have no dealings with that woman.\"\n\n\"Your father's widow, sir,\" said Mr. Furnival, \"is an unhappy lady,\nwho is now doing her best to atone for the only fault of which I\nbelieve her to have been guilty. If you were not unreasonable as well\nas angry, you would understand that the proposition which I am now\nmaking to you is one which should force you to forgive any injury\nwhich she may hitherto have done to you. Your half-brother Lucius\nMason has instructed me to make over to you the possession of Orley\nFarm.\" These last words Mr. Furnival uttered very slowly, fixing his\nkeen grey eyes full upon the face of Joseph Mason as he did so, and\nthen turning round to the attorney he said, \"I presume your client\nwill understand me now.\"\n\n\"The estate is yours, Mr. Mason,\" said Round. \"You have nothing to do\nbut to take possession of it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said Mason, turning round upon Furnival.\n\n\"Exactly what I say. Your half-brother Lucius surrenders to you the\nestate.\"\n\n\"Without payment?\"\n\n\"Yes; without payment. On his doing so you will of course absolve him\nfrom all liability on account of the proceeds of the property while\nin his hands.\"\n\n\"That will be a matter of course,\" said Mr. Round.\n\n\"Then she has robbed me,\" said Mason, jumping up to his feet. \"By\n----, the will was forged after all.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason,\" said Mr. Round, \"if you have a spark of generosity\nin you, you will accept the offer made to you without asking any\nquestion. By no such questioning can you do yourself any good,--nor\ncan you do that poor lady any harm.\"\n\n\"I knew it was so,\" he said loudly, and as he spoke he twice walked\nthe length of the room. \"I knew it was so;--twenty years ago I\nsaid the same. She forged the will. I ask you, as my lawyer, Mr.\nRound,--did she not forge the will herself?\"\n\n\"I shall answer no such question, Mr. Mason.\"\n\n\"Then by heavens I'll expose you. If I spend the whole value of the\nestate in doing it I'll expose you, and have her punished yet. The\nslippery villain! For twenty years she has robbed me.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mason, you are forgetting yourself in your passion,\" said Mr.\nFurnival. \"What you have to look for now is the recovery of the\nproperty.\" But here Mr. Furnival showed that he had not made himself\nmaster of Joseph Mason's character.\n\n\"No,\" shouted the angry man;--\"no, by heaven. What I have first to\nlook to is her punishment, and that of those who have assisted her. I\nknew she had done it,--and Dockwrath knew it. Had I trusted him, she\nwould now have been in gaol.\"\n\nMr. Furnival and Mr. Round were both desirous of having the matter\nquietly arranged, and with this view were willing to put up with\nmuch. The man had been ill used. When he declared for the fortieth\ntime that he had been robbed for twenty years, they could not deny\nit. When with horrid oaths he swore that that will had been a\nforgery, they could not contradict him. When he reviled the laws of\nhis country, which had done so much to facilitate the escape of a\ncriminal, they had no arguments to prove that he was wrong. They bore\nwith him in his rage, hoping that a sense of his own self-interest\nmight induce him to listen to reason. But it was all in vain. The\nproperty was sweet, but that sweetness was tasteless when compared to\nthe sweetness of revenge.\n\n\"Nothing shall make me tamper with justice;--nothing,\" said he.\n\n\"But even if it were as you say, you cannot do anything to her,\" said\nRound.\n\n\"I'll try,\" said Mason. \"You have been my attorney, and what you know\nin the matter you are bound to tell. And I'll make you tell, sir.\"\n\n\"Upon my word,\" said Round, \"this is beyond bearing. Mr. Mason, I\nmust trouble you to walk out of my office.\" And then he rang the\nbell. \"Tell Mr. Mat I want to see him.\" But before that younger\npartner had joined his father Joseph Mason had gone. \"Mat,\" said the\nold man, \"I don't interfere with you in many things, but on this I\nmust insist. As long as my name is in the firm Mr. Joseph Mason of\nGroby shall not be among our customers.\"\n\n\"The man's a fool,\" said Mr. Furnival. \"The end of all that will be\nthat two years will go by before he gets his property; and, in the\nmeantime, the house and all about it will go to ruin.\"\n\nIn these days there was a delightful family concord between Mr.\nFurnival and his wife, and perhaps we may be allowed to hope that the\npeace was permanent. Martha Biggs had not been in Harley Street since\nwe last saw her there, and was now walking round Red Lion Square by\nthe hour with some kindred spirit, complaining bitterly of the return\nwhich had been made for her friendship. \"What I endured, and what I\nwas prepared to endure for that woman, no breathing creature can ever\nknow,\" said Martha Biggs, to that other Martha; \"and now--\"\n\n\"I suppose the fact is he don't like to see you there,\" said the\nother.\n\n\"And is that a reason?\" said our Martha. \"Had I been in her place I\nwould not have put my foot in his house again till I was assured that\nmy friend should be as welcome there as myself. But then, perhaps, my\nideas of friendship may be called romantic.\"\n\nBut though there were heart-burnings and war in Red Lion Square,\nthere was sweet peace in Harley Street. Mrs. Furnival had learned\nthat beyond all doubt Lady Mason was an unfortunate woman on whose\nbehalf her husband was using his best energies as a lawyer; and\nthough rumours had begun to reach her that were very injurious to the\nlady's character, she did not on that account feel animosity against\nher. Had Lady Mason been guilty of all the sins in the calendar\nexcept one, Mrs. Furnival could find it within her heart to forgive\nher.\n\nBut Sophia was now more interested about Lady Mason than was her\nmother, and during those days of the trial was much more eager to\nlearn the news as it became known. She had said nothing to her mother\nabout Lucius, nor had she said anything as to Augustus Staveley. Miss\nFurnival was a lady who on such subjects did not want the assistance\nof a mother's counsel. Then, early on the morning that followed the\ntrial, they heard the verdict and knew that Lady Mason was free.\n\n\"I am so glad,\" said Mrs. Furnival; \"and I am sure it was your papa's\ndoing.\"\n\n\"But we will hope that she was really innocent,\" said Sophia.\n\n\"Oh, yes; of course; and so I suppose she was. I am sure I hope so.\nBut, nevertheless, we all know that it was going very much against\nher.\"\n\n\"I believe papa never thought she was guilty for a moment.\"\n\n\"I don't know, my dear; your papa never talks of the clients for whom\nhe is engaged. But what a thing it is for Lucius! He would have lost\nevery acre of the property.\"\n\n\"Yes; it's a great thing for him, certainly.\" And then she began to\nconsider whether the standing held by Lucius Mason in the world was\nnot even yet somewhat precarious.\n\nIt was on the same day--in the evening--that she received her lover's\nletter. She was alone when she read it, and she made herself quite\nmaster of its contents before she sat herself to think in what way it\nwould be expedient that she should act. \"I am bound to relinquish to\nmy brother-in-law my title to Orley Farm.\" Why should he be so bound,\nunless--? And then she also came to that conclusion which Mr. Round\nhad reached, and which Joseph Mason had reached, when they heard that\nthe property was to be given up. \"Yes, Sophia, I am a beggar,\" the\nletter went on to say. She was very sorry, deeply sorry;--so, at\nleast, she said to herself. As she sat there alone, she took out her\nhandkerchief and pressed it to her eyes. Then, having restored it to\nher pocket, after moderate use, she refolded her letter, and put that\ninto the same receptacle.\n\n\"Papa,\" said she, that evening, \"what will Mr. Lucius Mason do now?\nwill he remain at Orley Farm?\"\n\n\"No, my dear. He will leave Orley Farm, and, I think, will go abroad\nwith his mother.\"\n\n\"And who will have Orley Farm?\"\n\n\"His brother Joseph, I believe.\"\n\n\"And what will Lucius have?\"\n\n\"I cannot say. I do not know that he will have anything. His mother\nhas an income of her own, and he, I suppose, will go into some\nprofession.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed. Is not that very sad for him, poor fellow?\" In answer to\nwhich her father made no remark.\n\nThat night, in her own room, she answered her lover's letter, and her\nanswer was as follows:--\n\n\n   Harley Street, March, 18--.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. MASON,\n\n   I need hardly tell you that I was grieved to the heart by\n   the tidings conveyed in your letter. I will not ask you\n   for that secret which you withhold from me, feeling that\n   I have no title to inquire into it; nor will I attempt to\n   guess at the cause which induces you to give up to your\n   brother the property which you were always taught to\n   regard as your own. That you are actuated by noble motives\n   I am sure; and you may be sure of this, that I shall\n   respect you quite as highly in your adversity as I have\n   ever done in your prosperity. That you will make your way\n   in the world, I shall never doubt; and it may be that the\n   labour which you will now encounter will raise you to\n   higher standing than any you could have achieved, had the\n   property remained in your possession.\n\n   I think you are right in saying, with reference to our\n   mutual regard for each other, that neither should be\n   held as having any claim upon the other. Under present\n   circumstances, any such claim would be very silly. Nothing\n   would hamper you in your future career so much as a long\n   marriage engagement; and for myself, I am aware that the\n   sorrow and solicitude thence arising would be more than I\n   could support. Apart from this, also, I feel certain that\n   I should never obtain my father's sanction for such an\n   engagement, nor could I make it, unless he sanctioned it.\n   I feel so satisfied that you will see the truth of this,\n   that I need not trouble you, and harass my own heart by\n   pursuing the subject any further.\n\n   My feelings of friendship for you--of affectionate\n   friendship--will be as true as ever. I shall look to your\n   future career with great hope, and shall hear of your\n   success with the utmost satisfaction. And I trust that\n   the time may come, at no very distant date, when we may\n   all welcome your return to London, and show you that our\n   regard for you has never been diminished.\n\n   May God bless and preserve you in the trials which are\n   before you, and carry you through them with honour and\n   safety. Wherever you may be I shall watch for tidings of\n   you with anxiety, and always hear them with gratification.\n   I need hardly bid you remember that you have no more\n   affectionate friend\n\n   Than yours always most sincerely,\n\n   SOPHIA FURNIVAL.\n\n   P.S.--I believe that a meeting between us at the present\n   moment would only cause pain to both of us. It might drive\n   you to speak of things which should be wrapped in silence.\n   At any rate, I am sure that you will not press it on me.\n\n\nLucius, when he received this letter, was living with his mother in\nlodgings near Finsbury Circus, and the letter had been redirected\nfrom Hamworth to a post-office in that neighbourhood. It was his\nintention to take his mother with him to a small town on one of the\nrivers that feed the Rhine, and there remain hidden till he could\nfind some means by which he might earn his bread. He was sitting with\nher in the evening, with two dull tallow candles on the table between\nthem, when his messenger brought the letter to him. He read it in\nsilence very deliberately, then crushed it in his hand, and threw it\nfrom him with violence into the fire.\n\n\"I hope there is nothing further to distress you, Lucius,\" said his\nmother, looking up into his face as though she were imploring his\nconfidence.\n\n\"No, nothing; nothing that matters. It is an affair quite private to\nmyself.\"\n\nSir Peregrine had spoken with great truth when he declared that\nLucius Mason was able to bear adversity. This last blow had now come\nupon him, but he made no wailings as to his misery, nor did he say\na word further on the subject. His mother watched the paper as the\nflame caught it and reduced it to an ash; but she asked no further\nquestion. She knew that her position with him did not permit of her\nasking, or even hoping, for his confidence.\n\n\"I had no right to expect it would be otherwise,\" he said to himself.\nBut even to himself he spoke no word of reproach against Miss\nFurnival. He had realised the circumstances by which he was\nsurrounded, and had made up his mind to bear their result.\n\nAs for Miss Furnival, we may as well declare here that she did not\nbecome Mrs. Staveley. Our old friend Augustus conceived that he had\nreceived a sufficient answer on the occasion of his last visit to\nHarley Street, and did not repeat it immediately. Such little scenes\nas that which took place there had not been uncommon in his life; and\nwhen in after months he looked back upon the affair, he counted it up\nas one of those miraculous escapes which had marked his career.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX.\n\nFAREWELL.\n\n\n\"That letter you got this morning, my dear, was it not from Lady\nMason?\"\n\n\"It was from Lady Mason, father; they go on Thursday.\"\n\n\"On Thursday; so soon as that.\" And then Sir Peregrine, who had asked\nthe question, remained silent for a while. The letter, according\nto the family custom, had been handed to Mrs. Orme over the\nbreakfast-table; but he had made no remark respecting it till they\nwere alone together and free from the servants. It had been a\nfarewell letter, full of love and gratitude, and full also of\nrepentance. Lady Mason had now been for three weeks in London, and\nonce during that time Mrs. Orme had gone up to visit her. She had\nthen remained with her friend for hours, greatly to Lady Mason's\ncomfort, and now this letter had come, bringing a last adieu.\n\n[Illustration: Farewell!]\n\n\"You may read it, sir, if you like,\" said Mrs. Orme, handing him the\nletter. It was evident, by his face, that he was gratified by the\nprivilege; and he read it, not once only, but over and over again. As\nhe did so, he placed himself in the shade, and sat with his back to\nMrs. Orme; but nevertheless she could see that from time to time he\nrubbed his eyes with the back of his hand, and gradually raised his\nhandkerchief to his face.\n\n\"Thank you, dearest,\" he said, as he gave the letter back to her.\n\n\"I think that we may forgive her now, even all that she has done,\"\nsaid Mrs. Orme.\n\n\"Yes--yes--yes,\" he answered. \"For myself, I forgave her from the\nfirst.\"\n\n\"I know you did. But as regards the property,--it has been given up\nnow.\" And then again they were silent.\n\n\"Edith,\" he said, after a while, \"I have forgiven her altogether. To\nme she is the same as though she had never done that deed. Are we not\nall sinners?\"\n\n\"Surely, father.\"\n\n\"And can I say because she did one startling thing that the total of\nher sin is greater than mine? Was I ever tempted as she was tempted?\nWas my youth made dangerous for me as was hers? And then she did\nnothing for herself; she did it all for another. We may think of that\nnow.\"\n\n\"I have thought of it always.\"\n\n\"It did not make the sin the less; but among her fellow-mortals--\"\nAnd then he stopped himself, wanting words to express his meaning.\nThe sin, till it was repented, was damning; but now that it was\nrepented, he could almost love the sinner for the sin.\n\n\"Edith,\" he said, again. And he looked at her so wishfully! She knew\nwell what was the working of his heart, and she knew also that she\ndid not dare to encourage him.\n\n\"I trust,\" said Mrs. Orme, \"that she will bear her present lot for a\nfew years; and then, perhaps--\"\n\n\"Ah! then I shall be in my grave. A few months will do that.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\"\n\n\"Why should I not save her from such a life as that?\"\n\n\"From that which she had most to fear she has been saved.\"\n\n\"Had she not so chosen it herself, she could now have demanded from\nme a home. Why should I not give it to her now?\"\n\n\"A home here, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes;--why not? But I know what you would say. It would be wrong,--to\nyou and Perry.\"\n\n\"It would be wrong to yourself, sir. Think of it, father. It is the\nfact that she did that thing. We may forgive her, but others will not\ndo so on that account. It would not be right that you should bring\nher here.\"\n\nSir Peregrine knew that it would not be right. Though he was old, and\nweak in body, and infirm in purpose, his judgment had not altogether\nleft him. He was well aware that he would offend all social laws if\nhe were to do that which he contemplated, and ask the world around\nhim to respect as Lady Orme--as his wife, the woman who had so deeply\ndisgraced herself. But yet he could hardly bring himself to confess\nthat it was impossible. He was as a child who knows that a coveted\ntreasure is beyond his reach, but still covets it, still longs for\nit, hoping against hope that it may yet be his own. It seemed to him\nthat he might yet regain his old vitality if he could wind his arm\nonce more about her waist, and press her to his side, and call her\nhis own. It would be so sweet to forgive her; to make her sure that\nshe was absolutely forgiven; to teach her that there was one at\nleast who would not bring up against her her past sin, even in his\nmemory. As for his grandson, the property should be abandoned to him\naltogether. 'Twas thus he argued with himself; but yet, as he argued,\nhe knew that it could not be so.\n\n\"I was harsh to her when she told me,\" he said, after another\npause--\"cruelly harsh.\"\n\n\"She does not think so.\"\n\n\"No. If I had spurned her from me with my foot, she would not have\nthought so. She had condemned herself, and therefore I should have\nspared her.\"\n\n\"But you did spare her. I am sure she feels that from the first to\nthe last your conduct to her has been more than kind.\"\n\n\"And I owed her more than kindness, for I loved her;--yes, I loved\nher, and I do love her. Though I am a feeble old man, tottering to my\ngrave, yet I love her--love her as that boy loves the fair girl for\nwhom he longs. He will overcome it, and forget it, and some other one\nas fair will take her place. But for me it is all over.\"\n\nWhat could she say to him? In truth, it was all over,--such love\nat least as that of which his old heart was dreaming in its dotage.\nThere is no Medea's caldron from which our limbs can come out young\nand fresh; and it were well that the heart should grow old as does\nthe body.\n\n\"It is not all over while we are with you,\" she said, caressing him.\nBut she knew that what she said was a subterfuge.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I have you, dearest,\" he answered. But he also knew that\nthat pretence at comfort was false and hollow.\n\n\"And she starts on Thursday,\" he said; \"on next Thursday.\"\n\n\"Yes, on Thursday. It will be much better for her to be away from\nLondon. While she is there she never ventures even into the street.\"\n\n\"Edith, I shall see her before she goes.\"\n\n\"Will that be wise, sir?\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. It may be foolish,--very foolish; but still I shall\nsee her. I think you forget, Edith, that I have never yet bidden her\nfarewell. I have not spoken to her since that day when she behaved so\ngenerously.\"\n\n\"I do not think that she expects it, father.\"\n\n\"No; she expects nothing for herself. Had it been in her nature to\nexpect such a visit, I should not have been anxious to make it. I\nwill go to-morrow. She is always at home you say?\"\n\n\"Yes, she is always at home.\"\n\n\"And, Lucius--\"\n\n\"You will not find him there in the daytime.\"\n\n\"I shall go to-morrow, dear. You need not tell Peregrine.\"\n\nMrs. Orme still thought that he was wrong, but she had nothing\nfurther to say. She could not hinder his going, and therefore, with\nhis permission she wrote a line to Lady Mason, telling her of his\npurpose. And then, with all the care in her power, and with infinite\nsoftness of manner, she warned him against the danger which she so\nmuch feared. What might be the result, if, overcome by tenderness,\nhe should again ask Lady Mason to become his wife? Mrs. Orme firmly\nbelieved that Lady Mason would again refuse; but, nevertheless, there\nwould be danger.\n\n\"No,\" said he, \"I will not do that. When I have said so you may\naccept my word.\" Then she hastened to apologise to him, but he\nassured her with a kiss that he was in nowise angry with her.\n\nHe held by his purpose, and on the following day he went up to\nLondon. There was nothing said on the matter at breakfast, nor did\nshe make any further endeavour to dissuade him. He was infirm, but\nstill she knew that the actual fatigue would not be of a nature to\ninjure him. Indeed her fear respecting him was rather in regard to\nhis staying at home than to his going abroad. It would have been well\nfor him could he have been induced to think himself fit for more\nactive movement.\n\nLady Mason was alone when he reached the dingy little room near\nFinsbury Circus, and received him standing. She was the first to\nspeak, and this she did before she had even touched his hand. She\nstood to meet him, with her eyes turned to the ground, and her hands\ntightly folded together before her. \"Sir Peregrine,\" she said, \"I did\nnot expect from you this mark of your--kindness.\"\n\n\"Of my esteem and affection, Lady Mason,\" he said. \"We have known\neach other too well to allow of our parting without a word. I am an\nold man, and it will probably be for ever.\"\n\nThen she gave him her hand, and gradually lifted her eyes to his\nface. \"Yes,\" she said; \"it will be for ever. There will be no coming\nback for me.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; we will not say that. That's as may be hereafter. But it\nwill not be at once. It had better not be quite at once. Edith tells\nme that you go on Thursday.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir; we go on Thursday.\"\n\nShe had still allowed her hand to remain in his, but now she withdrew\nit, and asked him to sit down. \"Lucius is not here,\" she said. \"He\nnever remains at home after breakfast. He has much to settle as to\nour journey; and then he has his lawyers to see.\"\n\nSir Peregrine had not at all wished to see Lucius Mason, but he did\nnot say so. \"You will give him my regards,\" he said, \"and tell him\nthat I trust that he may prosper.\"\n\n\"Thank you. I will do so. It is very kind of you to think of him.\"\n\n\"I have always thought highly of him as an excellent young man.\"\n\n\"And he is excellent. Where is there any one who could suffer without\na word as he suffers? No complaint ever comes from him; and yet--I\nhave ruined him.\"\n\n\"No, no. He has his youth, his intellect, and his education. If such\na one as he cannot earn his bread in the world--ay, and more than\nhis bread--who can do so? Nothing ruins a young man but ignorance,\nidleness, and depravity.\"\n\n\"Nothing;--unless those of whom he should be proud disgrace him\nbefore the eyes of the world. Sir Peregrine, I sometimes wonder at my\nown calmness. I wonder that I can live. But, believe me, that never\nfor a moment do I forget what I have done. I would have poured out\nfor him my blood like water, if it would have served him; but instead\nof that I have given him cause to curse me till the day of his death.\nThough I still live, and eat, and sleep, I think of that always. The\nremembrance is never away from me. They bid those who repent put on\nsackcloth, and cover themselves with ashes. That is my sackcloth, and\nit is very sore. Those thoughts are ashes to me, and they are very\nbitter between my teeth.\"\n\nHe did not know with what words to comfort her. It all was as she\nsaid, and he could not bid her even try to free herself from that\nsackcloth and from those ashes. It must be so. Were it not so with\nher, she would not have been in any degree worthy of that love which\nhe felt for her. \"God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"for the shorn lamb--\" And then she was silent\nagain. But could that bitter, biting wind be tempered for the\nshe-wolf who, in the dead of night, had broken into the fold, and\nwith prowling steps and cunning clutch had stolen the fodder from the\nsheep? That was the question as it presented itself to her; but she\nsat silent, and refrained from putting it into words. She sat silent,\nbut he read her heart. \"For the shorn lamb--\" she had said, and he\nhad known her thoughts, as they followed, quick, one upon another,\nthrough her mind. \"Mary,\" he said, seating himself now close beside\nher on the sofa, \"if his heart be as true to you as mine, he will\nnever remember these things against you.\"\n\n\"It is my memory, not his, that is my punishment,\" she said.\n\nWhy could he not take her home with him, and comfort her, and heal\nthat festering wound, and stop that ever-running gush of her heart's\nblood? But he could not. He had pledged his word and pawned his\nhonour. All the comfort that could be his to bestow must be given in\nthose few minutes that remained to him in that room. And it must be\ngiven, too, without falsehood. He could not bring himself to tell her\nthat the sackcloth need not be sore to her poor lacerated body, nor\nthe ashes bitter between her teeth. He could not tell her that the\ncup of which it was hers to drink might yet be pleasant to the taste,\nand cool to the lips! What could he tell her? Of the only source of\ntrue comfort others, he knew, had spoken,--others who had not spoken\nin vain. He could not now take up that matter, and press it on her\nwith available strength. For him there was but one thing to say. He\nhad forgiven her; he still loved her; he would have cherished her in\nhis bosom had it been possible. He was a weak, old, foolish man; and\nthere was nothing of which he could speak but of his own heart.\n\n\"Mary,\" he said, again taking her hand, \"I wish--I wish that I could\ncomfort you.\"\n\n\"And yet on you also have I brought trouble, and misery--and--all but\ndisgrace!\"\n\n\"No, my love, no; neither misery nor disgrace,--except this misery,\nthat I shall be no longer near to you. Yes, I will tell you all now.\nWere I alone in the world, I would still beg you to go back with me.\"\n\n\"It cannot be; it could not possibly be so.\"\n\n\"No; for I am not alone. She who loves you so well, has told me so.\nIt must not be. But that is the source of my misery. I have learned\nto love you too well, and do not know how to part with you. If this\nhad not been so, I would have done all that an old man might to\ncomfort you.\"\n\n\"But it has been so,\" she said. \"I cannot wash out the past. Knowing\nwhat I did of myself, Sir Peregrine, I should never have put my foot\nover your threshold.\"\n\n\"I wish I might hear its step again upon my floors. I wish I might\nhear that light step once again.\"\n\n\"Never, Sir Peregrine. No one again ever shall rejoice to hear either\nmy step or my voice, or to see my form, or to grasp my hand. The\nworld is over for me, and may God soon grant me relief from my\nsorrow. But to you--in return for your goodness--\"\n\n\"For my love.\"\n\n\"In return for your love, what am I to say? I could have loved you\nwith all my heart had it been so permitted. Nay, I did do so. Had\nthat dream been carried out, I should not have sworn falsely when I\ngave you my hand. I bade her tell you so from me, when I parted with\nher.\"\n\n\"She did tell me.\"\n\n\"I have known but little love. He--Sir Joseph--was my master rather\nthan my husband. He was a good master, and I served him truly--except\nin that one thing. But I never loved him. But I am wrong to talk\nof this, and I will not talk of it longer. May God bless you, Sir\nPeregrine! It will be well for both of us now that you should leave\nme.\"\n\n\"May God bless you, Mary, and preserve you, and give back to you the\ncomforts of a quiet spirit, and a heart at rest! Till you hear that I\nam under the ground you will know that there is one living who loves\nyou well.\" Then he took her in his arms, twice kissed her on the\nforehead, and left the room without further speech on either side.\n\n[Illustration: Farewell!]\n\nLady Mason, as soon as she was alone, sat herself down, and her\nthoughts ran back over the whole course of her life. Early in her\ndays, when the world was yet beginning to her, she had done one evil\ndeed, and from that time up to those days of her trial she had been\nthe victim of one incessant struggle to appear before the world as\nthough that deed had not been done,--to appear innocent of it before\nthe world, but, beyond all things, innocent of it before her son.\nFor twenty years she had striven with a labour that had been all but\nunendurable; and now she had failed, and every one knew her for what\nshe was. Such had been her life; and then she thought of the life\nwhich might have been hers. In her earlier days she had known what\nit was to be poor, and had seen and heard those battles after money\nwhich harden our hearts, and quench the poetry of our natures. But it\nhad not been altogether so with her. Had things gone differently with\nher it might afterwards have been said that she had gone through the\nfire unscathed. But the beast had set his foot upon her, and when the\ntemptation came it was too much for her. Not for herself would she\nhave sinned, or have robbed that old man, who had been to her a kind\nmaster. But when a child was born to her, her eyes were blind, and\nshe could not see that wealth ill gotten for her child would be\nas sure a curse as wealth ill gotten for herself. She remembered\nRebekah, and with the cunning of a second Rebekah she filched a\nworld's blessing for her baby. Now she thought of all this as\npictures of that life which might have been hers passed before her\nmind's eye.\n\nAnd they were pleasant pictures, had they not burnt into her very\nsoul as she looked at them. How sweet had been that drawing-room at\nThe Cleeve, as she sat there in luxurious quiet with her new friend!\nHow sweet had been that friendship with a woman pure in all her\nthoughts, graceful to the eye, and delicate in all her ways! She knew\nnow, as she thought of this, that to her had been given the power\nto appreciate such delights as these. How full of charm to her\nwould have been that life, in which there had been so much of\ntrue, innocent affection;--had the load ever been absent from her\nshoulders! And then she thought of Sir Peregrine, with his pleasant,\nancient manner and truth of heart, and told herself that she could\nhave been happy with the love of even so old a man as that,--had that\nburden been away from her! But the burden had never been away--never\ncould be away. Then she thought once more of her stern but just son,\nand as she bowed her head and kissed the rod, she prayed that her\nrelease might come to her soon.\n\nAnd now we will say farewell to her, and as we do so the chief\ninterest of our tale will end. I may, perhaps be thought to owe an\napology to my readers in that I have asked their sympathy for a woman\nwho had so sinned as to have placed her beyond the general sympathy\nof the world at large. If so, I tender my apology, and perhaps feel\nthat I should confess a fault. But as I have told her story that\nsympathy has grown upon myself till I have learned to forgive her,\nand to feel that I too could have regarded her as a friend. Of her\nfuture life I will not venture to say anything. But no lesson is\ntruer than that which teaches us to believe that God does temper the\nwind to the shorn lamb. To how many has it not seemed, at some one\nperiod of their lives, that all was over for them, and that to them\nin their afflictions there was nothing left but to die! And yet they\nhave lived to laugh again, to feel that the air was warm and the\nearth fair, and that God in giving them ever-springing hope had given\neverything. How many a sun may seem to set on an endless night, and\nyet rising again on some morrow--\n\n\n   \"He tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore\n    Flames in the forehead of the morning sky!\"\n\n\nFor Lady Mason let us hope that the day will come in which she also\nmay once again trick her beams in some modest, unassuming way, and\nthat for her the morning may even yet be sweet with a glad warmth.\nFor us, here in these pages, it must be sufficient to say this last\nkindly farewell.\n\nAs to Lucius Mason and the arrangement of his affairs with his\nstep-brother a very few concluding words will suffice. When Joseph\nMason left the office of Messrs. Round and Crook he would gladly\nhave sacrificed all hope of any eventual pecuniary benefit from\nthe possession of Orley Farm could he by doing so have secured\nthe condign punishment of her who had so long kept him out of his\ninheritance. But he soon found that he had no means of doing this.\nIn the first place he did not know where to turn for advice. He had\nquarrelled absolutely with Dockwrath, and though he now greatly\ndistrusted the Rounds, he by no means put implicit trust in him of\nHamworth. Of the Rounds he suspected that they were engaged to serve\nhis enemy, of Dockwrath he felt sure that he was anxious only to\nserve himself. Under these circumstances he was driven into the arms\nof a third attorney, and learned from him, after a delay that cut\nhim to the soul, that he could take no further criminal proceeding\nagainst Lady Mason. It would be impossible to have her even indicted\nfor the forgery,--seeing that two juries, at the interval of twenty\nyears, had virtually acquitted her,--unless new evidence which should\nbe absolute and positive in its kind should be forthcoming. But there\nwas no new evidence of any kind. The offer made to surrender the\nproperty was no evidence for a jury whatever it might be in the mind\nof the world at large.\n\n\"And what am I to do?\" asked Mason.\n\n\"Take the goods the gods provide you,\" said the attorney. \"Accept the\noffer which your half-brother has very generously made you.\"\n\n\"Generously!\" shouted Mason of Groby.\n\n\"Well, on his part it is generous. It is quite within his power to\nkeep it; and were he to do so no one would say he was wrong. Why\nshould he judge his mother?\"\n\nThen Mr. Joseph Mason went to another attorney; but it was of no\navail. The time was passing away, and he learned that Lady Mason and\nLucius had actually started for Germany. In his agony for revenge he\nhad endeavoured to obtain some legal order that should prevent her\ndeparture;--\"ne exeat regno,\" as he repeated over and over again to\nhis advisers learned in the law. But it was of no avail. Lady Mason\nhad been tried and acquitted, and no judge would interfere.\n\n\"We should soon have her back again, you know, if we had evidence of\nforgery,\" said the last attorney.\n\n\"Then, by ----! we will have her back again,\" said Mason.\n\nBut the threat was vain; nor could he get any one even to promise him\nthat she could be prosecuted and convicted. And by degrees the desire\nfor vengeance slackened as the desire for gain resumed its sway.\nMany men have threatened to spend a property upon a lawsuit who\nhave afterwards felt grateful that their threats were made abortive.\nAnd so it was with Mr. Mason. After remaining in town over a month\nhe took the advice of the first of those new lawyers and allowed\nthat gentleman to put himself in communication with Mr. Furnival.\nThe result was that by the end of six months he again came out of\nYorkshire to take upon himself the duties and privileges of the owner\nof Orley Farm.\n\nAnd then came his great fight with Dockwrath, which in the end ruined\nthe Hamworth attorney, and cost Mr. Mason more money than he ever\nliked to confess. Dockwrath claimed to be put in possession of Orley\nFarm at an exceedingly moderate rent, as to the terms of which he was\nprepared to prove that Mr. Mason had already entered into a contract\nwith him. Mr. Mason utterly ignored such contract, and contended that\nthe words contained in a certain note produced by Dockwrath amounted\nonly to a proposition to let him the land in the event of certain\ncircumstances and results--which circumstances and results never took\nplace.\n\nThis lawsuit Mr. Joseph Mason did win, and Mr. Samuel Dockwrath was,\nas I have said, ruined. What the attorney did to make it necessary\nthat he should leave Hamworth I do not know; but Miriam, his wife,\nis now the mistress of that lodging-house to which her own mahogany\nfurniture was so ruthlessly removed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX.\n\nSHOWING HOW AFFAIRS SETTLED THEMSELVES AT NONINGSBY.\n\n\nWe must now go back to Noningsby for one concluding chapter, and then\nour work will be completed. \"You are not to go away from Noningsby\nwhen the trial is over, you know. Mamma said that I had better tell\nyou so.\" It was thus that Madeline had spoken to Felix Graham as he\nwas going out to the judge's carriage on the last morning of the\ncelebrated great Orley Farm case, and as she did so she twisted one\nof her little fingers into one of his buttonholes. This she did with\na prettiness of familiarity, and the assumption of a right to give\nhim orders and hold him to obedience, which was almost intoxicating\nin its sweetness. And why should she not be familiar with him? Why\nshould she not hold him to obedience by his buttonhole? Was he not\nher own? Had she not chosen him and taken him up to the exclusion of\nall other such choosings and takings?\n\n\"I shall not go till you send me,\" he said, putting up his hand as\nthough to protect his coat, and just touching her fingers as he did\nso.\n\n\"Mamma says it will be stupid for you in the mornings, but it will\nnot be worse for you than for Augustus. He stays till after Easter.\"\n\n\"And I shall stay till after Whitsuntide unless I am turned out.\"\n\n\"Oh! but you will be turned out. I am not going to make myself\nanswerable for any improper amount of idleness. Papa says you have\ngot all the law courts to reform.\"\n\n\"There must be a double Hercules for such a set of stables as that,\"\nsaid Felix; and then with the slight ceremony to which I have before\nadverted he took his leave for the day.\n\n\"I suppose there will be no use in delaying it,\" said Lady Staveley\non the same morning as she and her daughter sat together in the\ndrawing-room. They had already been talking over the new engagement\nby the hour, together; but that is a subject on which mothers\nwith marriageable daughters never grow tired, as all mothers and\nmarriageable daughters know full well.\n\n\"Oh! mamma, I think it must be delayed.\"\n\n\"But why, my love? Mr. Graham has not said so?\"\n\n\"You must call him Felix, mamma. I'm sure it's a nice name.\"\n\n\"Very well, my dear, I will.\"\n\n\"No; he has said nothing yet. But of course he means to wait\ntill,--till it will be prudent.\"\n\n\"Men never care for prudence of that kind when they are really in\nlove;--and I'm sure he is.\"\n\n\"Is he, mamma?\"\n\n\"He will marry on anything or nothing. And if you speak to him he\ntells you of how the young ravens were fed. But he always forgets\nthat he's not a young raven himself.\"\n\n\"Now you're only joking, mamma.\"\n\n\"Indeed I'm quite in earnest. But I think your papa means to make up\nan income for you,--only you must not expect to be rich.\"\n\n\"I do not want to be rich. I never did.\"\n\n\"I suppose you will live in London, and then you can come down here\nwhen the courts are up. I do hope he won't ever want to take a\nsituation in the colonies.\"\n\n\"Who, Felix? Why should he go to the colonies?\"\n\n\"They always do,--the clever young barristers who marry before they\nhave made their way. That would be very dreadful. I really think it\nwould kill me.\"\n\n\"Oh! mamma, he sha'n't go to any colony.\"\n\n\"To be sure there are the county courts now, and they are better. I\nsuppose you wouldn't like to live at Leeds or Merthyr-Tydvil?\"\n\n\"Of course I shall live wherever he goes; but I don't know why you\nshould send him to Merthyr-Tydvil.\"\n\n\"Those are the sort of places they do go to. There is young Mrs.\nBright Newdegate,--she had to go to South Shields, and her babies\nare all dreadfully delicate. She lost two, you know. I do think the\nLord Chancellor ought to think about that. Reigate, or Maidstone, or\nanywhere about Great Marlow would not be so bad.\" And in this way\nthey discussed the coming event and the happy future, while Felix\nhimself was listening to the judge's charge and thinking of his\nclient's guilt.\n\nThen there were two or three days passed at Noningsby of almost\nunalloyed sweetness. It seemed that they had all agreed that Prudence\nshould go by the board, and that Love with sweet promises, and hopes\nbright as young trees in spring, should have it all her own way.\nJudge Staveley was a man who on such an occasion--knowing with whom\nhe had to deal--could allow ordinary prudence to go by the board.\nThere are men, and excellent men too, from whose minds the cares\nof life never banish themselves, who never seem to remember that\nprovision is made for the young ravens. They toil and spin always,\nthinking sternly of the worst and rarely hoping for the best. They\nare ever making provision for rainy days, as though there were to be\nno more sunshine. So anxious are they for their children that they\ntake no pleasure in them, and their fear is constant that the earth\nwill cease to produce her fruits. Of such was not the judge. \"Dulce\nest desipere in locis,\" he would say, \"and let the opportunities be\nfrequent and the occasions many.\" Such a love-making opportunity as\nthis surely should be one.\n\nSo Graham wandered about through the dry March winds with his future\nbride by his side, and never knew that the blasts came from the\npernicious east. And she would lean on his arm as though he had been\nthe friend of her earliest years, listening to and trusting him in\nall things. That little finger, as they stood together, would get up\nto his buttonhole, and her bright frank eyes would settle themselves\non his, and then her hand would press closely upon his arm, and he\nknew that she was neither ashamed nor afraid of her love. Her love to\nher was the same as her religion. When it was once acknowledged by\nher to be a thing good and trustworthy, all the world might know it.\nWas it not a glory to her that he had chosen her, and why should she\nconceal her glory? Had it been that some richer, greater man had won\nher love,--some one whose titles were known and high place in the\nworld approved,--it may well be that then she would have been less\nfree with him.\n\n\"Papa would like it best if you would give up your writing, and think\nof nothing but the law,\" she said to him. In answer to which he told\nher, with many compliments to the special fox in question, that story\nof the fox who had lost his tail and thought it well that other foxes\nshould dress themselves as he was dressed.\n\n\"At any rate papa looks very well without his tail,\" said Madeline\nwith somewhat of a daughter's pride. \"But you shall wear yours all\nthe same, if you like it,\" she added with much of a young maiden's\nlove.\n\nAs they were thus walking near the house on the afternoon of the\nthird or fourth day after the trial, one of the maids came to them\nand told Madeline that a gentleman was in the house who wished to see\nher.\n\n\"A gentleman!\" said Madeline.\n\n\"Mr. Orme, miss. My lady told me to ask you up if you were anywhere\nnear.\"\n\n\"I suppose I must go,\" said Madeline, from whom all her pretty\nfreedom of manner and light happiness of face departed on the moment.\nShe had told Felix everything as to poor Peregrine in return for that\nstory of his respecting Mary Snow. To her it seemed as though that\nhad made things equal between them,--for she was too generous to\nobserve that though she had given nothing to her other lover, Felix\nhad been engaged for many months to marry his other love. But girls,\nI think, have no objection to this. They do not desire first fruits,\nor even early fruits, as men do. Indeed, I am not sure whether\nexperience on the part of a gentleman in his use of his heart is not\nsupposed by most young ladies to enhance the value of the article.\nMadeline was not in the least jealous of Mary Snow; but with great\ngood nature promised to look after her, and patronise her when she\nshould have become Mrs. Albert Fitzallen. \"But I don't think I should\nlike that Mrs. Thomas,\" she said.\n\n\"You would have mended the stockings for her all the same.\"\n\n\"O yes, I would have done that;--and so did Miss Snow. But I would\nhave kept my box locked. She should never have seen my letters.\"\n\nIt was now absolutely necessary that she should return to the house,\nand say to Peregrine Orme what words of comfort might be possible for\nher. If she could have spoken simply with her heart, she would have\nsaid much that was friendly, even though it might not be comfortable.\nBut it was necessary that she should express herself in words, and\nshe felt that the task was very difficult. \"Will you come in?\" she\nsaid to Felix.\n\n\"No, I think not. But he's a splendid fellow, and to me was a stanch\nfriend. If I can catch him as he comes out I will speak to him.\"\nAnd then Madeline, with hesitating steps, with her hat still on her\nhead, and her gloves on her hands, walked through the hall into the\ndrawing-room. There she found her mother seated on the sofa, and\nPeregrine Orme standing before her. Madeline walked up to him with\nextended hand and a kindly welcome, though she felt that the colour\nwas high in her cheeks. Of course it would be impossible to come out\nfrom such an interview as this without having confessed her position,\nor hearing it confessed by her mother in her presence. That, however,\nhad been already done, and Peregrine knew that the prize was gone.\n\n\"How do you do, Miss Staveley?\" said he. \"As I am going to leave The\nCleeve for a long time, I have come over to say good-bye to Lady\nStaveley--and to you.\"\n\n\"Are you going away, Mr. Orme?\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall go abroad,--to Central Africa, I think. It seems a wild\nsort of place with plenty of animals to kill.\"\n\n\"But isn't it very dangerous?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. The people always come back alive. I've a sort\nof idea that nothing will kill me. At any rate I couldn't stay here.\"\n\n\"Madeline, dear, I've told Mr. Orme that you have accepted Mr.\nGraham. With a friend such as he is I know that you will not be\nanxious to keep this a secret.\"\n\n\"No, mamma.\"\n\n\"I was sure of that; and now that your papa has consented to it, and\nthat it is quite fixed, I am sure that it is better that he should\nknow it. We shall always look upon him as a very dear friend--if he\nwill allow us.\"\n\nThen it was necessary that Peregrine should speak, which he did as\nfollows, holding Madeline's hand for the first three or four seconds\nof the time:--\"Miss Staveley, I will say this of myself, that if ever\na fellow loved a girl truly, I loved you;--and I do so now as well or\nbetter than ever. It is no good my pretending to be contented, and\nall that sort of thing. I am not contented, but very unhappy. I have\nnever wished for but one thing in my life; and for that I would have\ngiven all that I have in the world. I know that I cannot have it, and\nthat I am not fit to have it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Orme, it is not that.\"\n\n\"But it is that. I knew you before Graham did, and loved you quite\nas soon. I believe--though of course I don't mean to ask any\nquestions--but I believe I told you so before he ever did.\"\n\n\"Marriages, they say, are planned in heaven,\" said Lady Staveley.\n\n\"Perhaps they are. I only wish this one had not been planned there.\nI cannot help it,--I cannot express my satisfaction, though I will\nheartily wish for your happiness. I knew from the first how it would\nbe, and was always sure that I was a fool to love you. I should have\ngone away when I first thought of it, for I used to feel that you\nnever cared to speak to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, indeed I did,\" said poor Madeline.\n\n\"No, you did not. And why should you when I had nothing to say for\nmyself? I ought to have fallen in love with some foolish chit with as\nlittle wit about her as I have myself.\"\n\n\"I hope you will fall in love with some very nice girl,\" said Lady\nStaveley; \"and that we shall know her and love her very much.\"\n\n\"Oh, I dare say I shall marry some day. I feel now as though I should\nlike to break my neck, but I don't suppose I shall. Good-bye, Lady\nStaveley.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Orme; and may God send that you may be happy.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Madeline. I shall never call you so again,--except to\nmyself. I do wish you may be happy,--I do indeed. As for him,--he has\nbeen before me, and taken away all that I wanted to win.\"\n\nBy this time the tears were in his eyes, and his voice was not free\nfrom their effect. Of this he was aware, and therefore, pressing her\nhand, he turned upon his heel and abruptly left the room. He had been\nunable to say that he wished also that Felix might be happy; but this\nomission was forgiven him by both the ladies. Poor Madeline, as he\nwent, muttered a kind farewell, but her tears had mastered her also,\nso that she could hardly speak.\n\nHe went directly to the stables, there got upon his horse, and then\nwalked slowly down the avenue towards the gate. He had got the better\nof that tear-compelling softness as soon as he found himself beyond\nthe presence of the girl he loved, and was now stern in his mood,\nstriving to harden his heart. He had confessed himself a fool in\ncomparison with Felix Graham; but yet,--he asked himself,--in spite\nof that, was it not possible that he would have made her a better\nhusband than the other? It was not to his title or his estate that he\ntrusted as he so thought, but to a feeling that he was more akin to\nher in circumstances, in ways of life, and in tenderness of heart. As\nall this was passing through his mind, Felix Graham presented himself\nto him in the road.\n\n\"Orme,\" said he, \"I heard that you were in the house, and have come\nto shake hands with you. I suppose you have heard what has taken\nplace. Will you not shake hands with me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Peregrine, \"I will not.\"\n\n\"I am sorry for that, for we were good friends, and I owe you much\nfor your kindness. It was a fair stand-up fight, and you should not\nbe angry.\"\n\n\"I am angry, and I don't want your friendship. Go and tell her that I\nsay so, if you like.\"\n\n\"No, I will not do that.\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart that we had both killed ourselves at that\nbank.\"\n\n\"For shame, Orme, for shame!\"\n\n\"Very well, sir; let it be for shame.\" And then he passed on, meaning\nto go through the gate, and leaving Graham on the grass by the\nroad-side. But before he had gone a hundred yards down the road his\nbetter feelings came back upon him, and he returned.\n\n\"I am unhappy,\" he said, \"and sore at heart. You must not mind what\nwords I spoke just now.\"\n\n\"No, no; I am sure you did not mean them,\" said Felix, putting his\nhand on the horse's mane.\n\n\"I did mean them then, but I do not mean them now. I won't say\nanything about wishes. Of course you will be happy with her. Anybody\nwould be happy with her. I suppose you won't die, and give a fellow\nanother chance.\"\n\n\"Not if I can help it,\" said Graham.\n\n\"Well, if you are to live, I don't wish you any evil. I do wish you\nhadn't come to Noningsby, that's all. Good-bye to you.\" And he held\nout his hand, which Graham took.\n\n\"We shall be good friends yet, for all that is come and gone,\" said\nGraham; and then there were no more words between them.\n\nPeregrine did as he said, and went abroad, extending his travels to\nmany wild countries, in which, as he used to say, any one else would\nhave been in danger. No danger ever came to him,--so at least he\nfrequently wrote word to his mother. Gorillas he slew by scores,\nlions by hundreds, and elephants sufficient for an ivory palace. The\nskins, and bones, and other trophies, he sent home in various ships;\nand when he appeared in London as a lion, no man doubted his word.\nBut then he did not write a book, nor even give lectures; nor did he\npresume to know much about the huge brutes he had slain, except that\nthey were pervious to powder and ball.\n\nSir Peregrine had endeavoured to keep him at home by giving up the\nproperty into his hands; but neither for grandfather, nor for mother,\nnor for lands and money would he remain in the neighbourhood of\nNoningsby. \"No, mother,\" he said; \"it will be better for me to be\naway.\" And away he went.\n\nThe old baronet lived to see him return, though with plaintive wail\nhe often declared to his daughter-in-law that this was impossible. He\nlived, but he never returned to that living life which had been his\nbefore he had taken up the battle for Lady Mason. He would sometimes\nallow Mrs. Orme to drive him about the grounds, but otherwise he\nremained in the house, sitting solitary over his fire,--with a\nbook, indeed, open before him, but rarely reading. He was waiting\npatiently, as he said, till death should come to him.\n\nMrs. Orme kept her promise, and wrote constantly to Lady\nMason,--hearing from her as constantly. When Lucius had been six\nmonths in Germany, he decided on going to Australia, leaving his\nmother for the present in the little German town in which they were\nstaying. For her, on the whole, the change was for the better. As\nto his success in a thriving colony, there can be but little doubt.\n\nFelix Graham was soon married to Madeline; and as yet I have not\nheard of any banishment either to Patagonia or to Merthyr-Tydvil.\n\nAnd now I may say, Farewell.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ORLEY FARM***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 23000-8.txt or 23000-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/3\/0\/0\/23000\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":119,"split":"train"}
