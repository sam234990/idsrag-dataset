{"ori_id":"778b1dc6fca050bfeb111f3e718d6fecce4bded4","title":"The Half-Hearted","context":"The Half-Hearted\n Set in the closing years of the 19th century, this two-part novel tells the story of Lewis Haystoun, a young Scottish laird. Part I of the novel is a story of manners and romance in upper class Scotland. Part II is quite different, and is an action tale of adventure and duty in northern India.\nWhen his local Member of Parliament decides to retire, Haystoun is persuaded to stand. Although he is liked and respected by his local tenants, he finds himself unable to speak wholeheartedly and with full conviction at the hustings and is beaten by his opponent, the ambitious and fluent social climber Albert Stocks. Following an initial meeting at a dinner party, both Haystoun and Stocks fall in love with Alice Wishart, the daughter of a rich city merchant. Miss Wishart initially favours Haystoun, but gradually becomes disenchanted with his apparent lack of ability to commit to anything. During a picnic on the moors, Miss Wishart slips and falls into a lake. Haystoun, standing beside her, hesitates just long enough to allow his rival to dive in and make the rescue. Haystoun is devastated, believes himself to be a coward and avoids Miss Wishart's company, pushing her more and more into the company of Stocks. Stocks asks her to marry him and, believing that Haystoun is not interested in her, she agrees.\nRumours have reached the British Government of a possible danger to the Empire via an uncharted area of the northern Indian frontier. Haystoun has explored this area before, and when he is asked by a friend to go out again to reconnoitre in a semi-official capacity, he jumps at the chance to escape his situation and to prove his courage. The night before his departure, Haystoun and Miss Wishart meet and declare their mutual love for the first time. Although there would still be time for Miss Wishart to break her engagement, the pair feel that they have been 'set apart by the fates' and they separate to follow their own individual paths.\nIn part II of the novel, Haystoun travels to the northern frontier lands where he learns of a Russian plot to invade India via a little-known narrow mountain pass in the Kashmir, with the help of the local hill tribes. Having become aware of an imminent Cossack attack, Haystoun sends word to the local fort, calling on them to telegraph warnings to the northern garrisons and settlements, and sets off alone to try to delay the invaders at the pass. There he dies heroically, but is able to delay the invasion for just time enough for the alarm to be raised and for defences to be put in place. The Empire is saved by his valiant efforts.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Half-Hearted, by John Buchan\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Its head is far inland in a place of mountain\nsolitudes, but its mouth is all but on the lip of the sea, and salt\nbreezes fight with the flying winds of the hills. It is a land of green\nmeadows on the brink of heather, of far-stretching fir woods that climb\nto the edge of the uplands and sink to the fringe of corn. Nowhere is\nthere any march between art and nature, for the place is in the main for\nsheep, and the single road which threads the glen is little troubled\nwith cart and crop-laden wagon. Midway there is a stretch of wood and\ngarden around the House of Glenavelin, the one great dwelling-place in\nthe vale. But it is a dwelling and a little more, for the home of the\nreal lords of the land is many miles farther up the stream, in the\nmoorland house of Etterick, where the Avelin is a burn, and the hills\nhang sharply over its source. To a stranger in an afternoon it seems a\nvery vale of content, basking in sun and shadow, green, deep, and\nsilent. But it is also a place of storms, for its name means the \"glen\nof white waters,\" and mist and snow are commoner in its confines than\nsummer heats.\n\nOn a very wet evening in June a young man in a high dogcart was driving\nup the glen. A deer-stalker's cap was tied down over his ears, and the\ncollar of a great white waterproof defended his neck. A cheerful\nbronzed face was shadowed by the peak of his cap, and two very keen grey\neyes peered out into the mist. He was driving with tight rein, for the\nmare was fresh and the road had awkward slopes and corners; but none the\nless he was dreaming, thinking pleasant thoughts, and now and then\nlooking cheerily at the ribs of hill which at times were cleared of\nmist. His clean-shaven face was wet and shining with the drizzle, pools\nformed on the floor of the cart, and the mare's flanks were plastered\nwith the weather.\n\nSuddenly he drew up sharp at the sight of a figure by the roadside.\n\n\"Hullo, Doctor Gracey,\" he cried, \"where on earth have you come from?\nCome in and I'll give you a lift.\"\n\nThe figure advanced and scrambled into the vacant seat. It was a little\nold man in a big topcoat with a quaint-fashioned wide-awake hat on his\nhead. In ill weather all distinctions are swept away. The stranger\nmight have been a statesman or a tramp.\n\n\"It is a pleasure to see you, Doctor,\" and the young man grasped a\nmittened hand and looked into his companion's face. There was something\nboth kindly and mirthful in his grey eyes.\n\nThe old man arranged his seat comfortably, buttoned another button at\nthe neck of the coat, and then scrutinised the driver. \"It's four\nyears--four years in October since I last cast eyes on you, Lewie, my\nboy,\" he said. \"I heard you were coming, so I refused a lift from\nHaystounslacks and the minister. Haystounslacks was driving from\nGledsmuir, and unless the Lord protects him he will be in Avelin water\nere he gets home. Whisky and a Glenavelin road never agree, Lewie, as I\nwho have mended the fool's head a dozen times should know. But I\nthought you would never come, and was prepared to ride in the next\nbaker's van.\" The Doctor spoke with the pure English and high northern\nvoice of an old school of professional men, whose tongue, save in\ntelling a story, knew not the vernacular, and yet in its pitch and\naccent inevitably betrayed their birthplace. Precise in speech and\ndress, uncommonly skilful, a mild humorist, and old in the world's\nwisdom, he had gone down the evening way of life with the heart of a\nboy.\n\n\"I was delayed--I could not help it, though I was all afternoon at the\njob,\" said the young man. \"I've seen a dozen and more tenants and I\ntalked sheep and drains till I got out of my depth and was gravely\ncorrected. It's the most hospitable place on earth, this, but I thought\nit a pity to waste a really fine hunger on the inevitable ham and eggs,\nso I waited for dinner. Lord, I have an appetite! Come and dine,\nDoctor. I am in solitary state just now, and long, wet evenings are\ndreary.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I must excuse myself, Lewie,\" was the formal answer, with\njust a touch of reproof. Dinner to Doctor Gracey was a serious\nceremony, and invitations should not be scattered rashly. \"My\nhousekeeper's wrath is not to be trifled with, as you should know.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said the young man in a tone of decent melancholy. \"She once\ncuffed my ears the month I stayed with you for falling in the burn.\nDoes she beat you, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Indeed, no,\" said the little old gentleman; \"not as yet. But\nphysically she is my superior and I live in terror.\" Then abruptly, \"For\nheaven's sake, Lewie, mind the mare.\"\n\n\"It's all right,\" said the driver, as the dogcart swung neatly round an\nugly turn. \"There's the mist going off the top of Etterick Law,\nand--why, that's the end of the Dreichill?\"\n\n\"It's the Dreichill, and beyond it is the Little Muneraw. Are you glad\nto be home, Lewie?\"\n\n\"Rather,\" said the young man gravely. \"This is my own countryside, and\nI fancy it's the last place a man forgets.\"\n\n\"I fancy so--with right-thinking people. By the way, I have much to\ncongratulate you on. We old fogies in this desert place have been often\nseeing your name in the newspapers lately. You are a most experienced\ntraveller.\"\n\n\"Fair. But people made a great deal more of that than it deserved. It\nwas very simple, and I had every chance. Some day I will go out and do\nthe same thing again with no advantages, and if I come back you may\npraise me then.\"\n\n\"Right, Lewie. A bare game and no chances is the rule of war. And now,\nwhat will you do?\"\n\n\"Settle down,\" said the young man with mock pathos, \"which in my case\nmeans settling up also. I suppose it is what you would call the crucial\nmoment in my life. I am going in for politics, as I always intended,\nand for the rest I shall live a quiet country life at Etterick. I've a\nwonderful talent for rusticity.\"\n\nThe Doctor shot an inquiring glance from beneath the flaps of his hat.\n\"I never can make up my mind about you, Lewie.\"\n\n\"I daresay not. It is long since I gave up trying to make up my mind\nabout myself.\"\n\n\"When you were a very small and very bad boy I made the usual prophecy\nthat you would make a spoon or spoil a horn. Later I declared you would\nmake the spoon. I still keep to that opinion, but I wish to goodness I\nknew what shape your spoon would take.\"\n\n\"Ornamental, Doctor, some odd fancy spoon, but not useful. I feel an\ninner lack of usefulness.\"\n\n\"Humph! Then things are serious, Lewie, and I, as your elder, should\ngive advice; but confound it, my dear, I cannot think what it should be.\nLife has been too easy for you, a great deal too easy. You want a\nlittle of the salt and iron of the world. You are too clever ever to be\nconceited, and you are too good a fellow ever to be a fool, but apart\nfrom these sad alternatives there are numerous middle stages which are\nnot very happy.\"\n\nThe young man's face lengthened, as it always did either in repose or\nreflection.\n\n\"You are old and wise, Doctor. Have you any cure for a man with\nsufficient money and no immediate profession to prevent stagnation?\"\n\n\"None,\" said the Doctor; \"but the man himself can find many. The chief\nis that he be conscious of his danger, and on the watch against it. As\na last expedient I should recommend a second course of travel.\"\n\n\"But am I to be barred from my home because of this bogey of yours?\"\n\n\"No, Lewie lad, but you must be kept, as you say, 'up to scratch,'\" and\nthe old face smiled. \"You are too good to waste. You Haystouns are\nhigh-strung, finicking people, on whom idleness sits badly. Also you\nare the last of your race and have responsibilities. You must remember\nI was your father's friend, and knew you all well.\"\n\nAt the mention of his father the young man's interest quickened.\n\n\"I must have been only about six years old when he died. I find so few\npeople who remember him well and can tell me about him.\"\n\n\"You are very like him, Lewie. He began nearly as well as you; but he\nsettled down into a quiet life, which was the very thing for which he\nwas least fitted. I do not know if he had altogether a happy time. He\nlost interest in things, and grew shy and rather irritable. He\nquarrelled with most of his neighbours, and got into a trick of\nmagnifying little troubles till he shrank from the slightest\ndiscomfort.\"\n\n\"And my mother?\"\n\n\"Ah, your mother was different--a cheery, brave woman. While she lived\nshe kept him in some measure of self-confidence, but you know she died\nat your birth, Lewie, and after that he grew morose and retiring. I\nspeak about these things from the point of view of my profession, and I\nfancy it is the special disease which lies in your blood. You have all\nbeen over-cultured and enervated; as I say, you want some of the salt\nand iron of life.\"\n\nThe young man's brow was furrowed in a deep frown which in no way broke\nthe good-humour of his face. They were nearing a cluster of houses, the\nlast clachan of sorts in the glen, where a kirk steeple in a grove of\ntrees proclaimed civilization. A shepherd passed them with a couple of\ndogs, striding with masterful step towards home and comfort. The cheery\nglow of firelight from the windows pleased both men as they were whirled\nthrough the raw weather.\n\n\"There, you see,\" said the Doctor, nodding his head towards the\nretreating figure; \"there's a man who in his own way knows the secret of\nlife. Most of his days are spent in dreary, monotonous toil. He is for\never wrestling with the weather and getting scorched and frozen, and the\nresult is that the sparse enjoyments of his life are relished with a\nrare gusto. He sucks his pipe of an evening with a zest which the man\nwho lies on his back all day smoking knows nothing about. So, too, the\nlabourer who hoes turnips for one and sixpence the day. They know the\narduousness of life, which is a lesson we must all learn sooner or\nlater. You people who have been coddled and petted must learn it, too;\nand for you it is harder to learn, but pleasanter in the learning,\nbecause you stand above the bare need of things, and have leisure for\nthe adornments. We must all be fighters and strugglers, Lewie, and it\nis better to wear out than to rust out. It is bad to let choice things\nbecome easily familiar; for, you know, familiarity is apt to beget a\nproverbial offspring.\"\n\nThe young man had listened attentively, but suddenly he leaned from the\nseat and with a dexterous twitch of his whip curled it round the leg of\na boy of sixteen who stood before a cottage.\n\n\"Hullo, Jock,\" he cried. \"When are you coming up to see me? Bring your\nbrother some day and we'll go and fish the Midburn.\" The urchin pulled\noff a ragged cap and grinned with pleasure.\n\n\"That's the boy you pulled out of the Avelin?\" asked the Doctor. \"I had\nheard of that performance. It was a good introduction to your\nhome-coming.\"\n\n\"It was nothing,\" said the young man, flushing slightly. \"I was\ncrossing the ford and the stream was up a bit. The boy was fishing,\nwading pretty deep, and in turning round to stare at me he slipped and\nwas carried down. I merely rode my horse out and collared him. There\nwas no danger.\"\n\n\"And the Black Linn just below,\" said the Doctor, incredulously. \"You\nhave got the usual modesty of the brave man, Lewie.\"\n\n\"It was a very small thing. My horse knew its business--that was all.\"\nAnd he flicked nervously with the whip.\n\nA grey house among trees rose on the left with a quaint gateway of\nunhewn stone. The dogcart pulled up, and the Doctor scrambled down and\nstood shaking the rain from his hat and collar. He watched the young\nman till, with a skilful turn, he had entered Etterick gates, and then\nwith a more meditative face than is usual in a hungry man he went\nthrough the trees to his own dwelling.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nLADY MANORWATER'S GUESTS\n\n\nWhen the afternoon train from the south drew into Gledsmuir station, a\ngirl who had been devouring the landscape for the last hour with eager\neyes, rose nervously to prepare for exit. To Alice Wishart the country\nwas a novel one, and the prospect before her an unexplored realm of\nguesses. The daughter of a great merchant, she had lived most of her\ndays in the ugly environs of a city, save for such time as she had spent\nat the conventional schools. She had never travelled; the world of men\nand things was merely a name to her, and a girlhood, lonely and\nbrightened chiefly by the companionship of books, had not given her\nself-confidence. She had casually met Lady Manorwater at some political\nmeeting in her father's house, and the elder woman had taken a strong\nliking to the quiet, abstracted child. Then came an invitation to\nGlenavelin, accepted gladly yet with much fear and searching of heart.\nNow, as she looked out on the shining mountain land, she was full of\ndelight that she was about to dwell in the heart of it. Something of\npride, too, was present, that she was to be the guest of a great lady,\nand see something of a life which seemed infinitely remote to her\nprovincial thoughts. But when her journey drew near its end she was\nfoolishly nervous, and scanned the platform with anxious eye.\n\nThe sight of her hostess reassured her. Lady Manorwater was a small\nmiddle-aged woman, with a thin classical face, large colourless eyes,\nand untidy fair hair. She was very plainly dressed, and as she darted\nforward to greet the girl with entire frankness and kindness, Alice\nforgot her fears and kissed her heartily. A languid young woman was\nintroduced as Miss Afflint, and in a few minutes the three were in the\nGlenavelin carriage with the wide glen opening in front.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, I hope you will enjoy your visit. We are quite a small\nparty, for Jack says Glenavelin is far too small to entertain in. You\nare fond of the country, aren't you? And of course the place is very\npretty. There is tennis and golf and fishing; but perhaps you don't\nlike these things? We are not very well off for neighbours, but we are\nlarge enough in number to be sufficient to ourselves. Don't you think\nso, Bertha?\" And Lady Manorwater smiled at the third member of the\ngroup.\n\nMiss Afflint, a silent girl, smiled back and said nothing. She had been\nengaged in a secret study of Alice's face, and whenever the object of\nthe study raised her eyes she found a pair of steady blue ones beaming\non her. It was a little disconcerting, and Alice gazed out at the\nlandscape with a fictitious curiosity.\n\nThey passed out of the Gled valley into the narrower strath of Avelin,\nand soon, leaving the meadows behind, went deep into the recesses of\nwoods. At a narrow glen bridged by the road and bright with the spray\nof cascades and the fresh green of ferns, Alice cried out in delight,\n\"Oh, I must come back here some day and sketch it. What a Paradise of a\nplace!\"\n\n\"Then you had better ask Lewie's permission.\" And Lady Manorwater\nlaughed.\n\n\"Who is Lewie?\" asked the girl, anticipating some gamekeeper or\nshepherd.\n\n\"Lewie is my nephew. He lives at Etterick, up at the head of the glen.\"\n\nMiss Afflint spoke for the first time. \"A very good man. You should\nknow Lewie, Miss Wishart. I'm sure you would like him. He is a great\ntraveller, you know, and has written a famous book. Lewis Haystoun is\nhis full name.\"\n\n\"Why, I have read it,\" cried Alice. \"You mean the book about Kashmir.\nBut I thought the author was an old man.\"\n\n\"Lewie is not very old,\" said his aunt; \"but I haven't seen him for\nyears, so he may be decrepit by this time. He is coming home soon, he\nsays, but he never writes. I know two of his friends who pay a Private\nInquiry Office to send them news of him.\"\n\nAlice laughed and became silent. What merry haphazard people were these\nshe had fallen among! At home everything was docketed and ordered.\nMeals were immovable feasts, the hour for bed and the hour for rising\nwere more regular than the sun's. Her father was full of proverbs on\nthe virtue of regularity, and was wont to attribute every vice and\nmisfortune to its absence. And yet here were men and women who got on\nvery well without it. She did not wholly like it. The little\ndoctrinaire in her revolted and she was pleased to be censorious.\n\n\"You are a very learned young woman, aren't you?\" said Lady Manorwater,\nafter a short silence. \"I have heard wonderful stories about your\nlearning. Then I hope you will talk to Mr. Stocks, for I am afraid he\nis shocked at Bertha's frivolity. He asked her if she was in favour of\nthe Prisons Regulation Bill, and she was very rude.\"\n\n\"I only said,\" broke in Miss Afflint, \"that owing to my lack of definite\nlocal knowledge I was not in a position to give an answer commensurate\nwith the gravity of the subject.\" She spoke in a perfect imitation of\nthe tone of a pompous man.\n\n\"Bertha, I do not approve of you,\" said Lady Manorwater. \"I forbid you\nto mimic Mr. Stocks. He is very clever, and very much in earnest over\neverything. I don't wonder that a butterfly like you should laugh, but\nI hope Miss Wishart will be kind to him.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I am very ignorant,\" said Alice hastily, \"and I am very\nuseless. I never did any work of any sort in my life, and when I think\nof you I am ashamed.\"\n\n\"Oh, my dear child, please don't think me a paragon,\" cried her hostess\nin horror. \"I am a creature of vague enthusiasms and I have the sense\nto know it. Sometimes I fancy I am a woman of business, and then I take\nup half a dozen things till Jack has to interfere to prevent financial\nruin. I dabble in politics and I dabble in philanthropy; I write review\narticles which nobody reads, and I make speeches which are a horror to\nmyself and a misery to my hearers. Only by the possession of a sense of\nhumour am I saved from insignificance.\"\n\nTo Alice the speech was the breaking of idols. Competence,\nresponsibility were words she had been taught to revere, and to hear\nthem light-heartedly disavowed seemed an upturning of the foundation of\nthings. You will perceive that her education had not included that\nvaluable art, the appreciation of the flippant.\n\nBy this time the carriage was entering the gates of the park, and the\nthick wood cleared and revealed long vistas of short hill grass, rising\nand falling like moorland, and studded with solitary clumps of firs.\nThen a turn in the drive brought them once more into shadow, this time\nbeneath a heath-clad knoll where beeches and hazels made a pleasant\ntangle. All this was new, not three years old; but soon they were in\nthe ancient part of the policy which had surrounded the old house of\nGlenavelin. Here the grass was lusher, the trees antique oaks and\nbeeches, and grey walls showed the boundary of an old pleasure-ground.\nHere in the soft sunlit afternoon sleep hung like a cloud, and the peace\nof centuries dwelt in the long avenues and golden pastures. Another\nturning and the house came in sight, at first glance a jumble of grey\ntowers and ivied walls. Wings had been built to the original square\nkeep, and even now it was not large, a mere moorland dwelling. But the\nwhitewashed walls, the crow-step gables, and the quaint Scots baronial\nturrets gave it a perfection to the eye like a house in a dream. To\nAlice, accustomed to the vulgarity of suburban villas with Italian\ncampaniles, a florid lodge a stone's throw from the house, darkened too\nwith smoke and tawdry with paint, this old-world dwelling was a patch of\nwonderland. Her eyes drank in the beauty of the place--the great blue\nbacks of hill beyond, the acres of sweet pasture, the primeval woods.\n\n\"Is this Glenavelin?\" she cried. \"Oh, what a place to live in!\"\n\n\"Yes, it's very pretty, dear.\" And Lady Manorwater, who possessed half a\ndozen houses up and down the land, patted her guest's arm and looked\nwith pleasure on the flushed girlish face.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nTwo hours later, Alice, having completed dressing, leaned out of her\nbedroom window to drink in the soft air of evening. She had not brought\na maid, and had refused her hostess's offer to lend her her own on the\nground that maids were a superfluity. It was her desire to be a very\npractical young person, a scorner of modes and trivialities, and yet she\nhad taken unusual care with her toilet this evening, and had spent many\nminutes before the glass. Looking at herself carefully, a growing\nconviction began to be confirmed--that she was really rather pretty.\nShe had reddish-brown hair and--a rare conjunction--dark eyes and\neyebrows and a delicate colour. As a small girl she had lamented\nbitterly the fate that had not given her the orthodox beauty of the dark\nor fair maiden, and in her school days she had passed for plain. Now it\nbegan to dawn on her that she had beauty of a kind--the charm of\nstrangeness; and her slim strong figure had the grace which a wholesome\nlife alone can give. She was in high spirits, curious, interested, and\ngenerous. The people amused her, the place was a fairyland and outside\nthe golden weather lay still and fragrant among the hills.\n\nWhen she came down to the drawing-room she found the whole party\nassembled. A tall man with a brown beard and a slight stoop ceased to\nassault the handle of a firescreen and came over to greet her. He had\nonly come back half an hour ago, he explained, and so had missed her\narrival. The face attracted and soothed her. Abundant kindness lurked\nin the humorous brown eyes, and a queer pucker on the brow gave him the\nair of a benevolent despot. If this was Lord Manorwater, she had no\nfurther dread of the great ones of the earth. There were four other\nmen, two of them mild, spectacled people, who had the air of students\nand a precise affected mode of talk, and one a boy cousin of whom no one\ntook the slightest notice. The fourth was a striking figure, a man of\nabout forty in appearance, tall and a little stout, with a rugged face\nwhich in some way suggested a picture of a prehistoric animal in an old\nnatural history she had owned. The high cheek-bones, large nose, and\nslightly protruding eyes had an unfinished air about them, as if their\nowner had escaped prematurely from a mould. A quantity of bushy black\nhair--which he wore longer than most men--enhanced the dramatic air of his\nappearance. It was a face full of vigour and a kind of strength,\nshrewd, a little coarse, and solemn almost to the farcical. He was\nintroduced in a rush of words by the hostess, but beyond the fact that\nit was a monosyllable, Alice did not catch his name.\n\nLord Manorwater took in Miss Afflint, and Alice fell to the dark man\nwith the monosyllabic name. He had a way of bowing over his hand which\nslightly repelled the girl, who had no taste for elaborate manners. His\nfirst question, too, displeased her. He asked her if she was one of the\nWisharts of some unpronounceable place.\n\nShe replied briefly that she did not know. Her grandfathers on both\nsides had been farmers.\n\nThe gentleman bowed with the smiling unconcern of one to whom pedigree\nis a matter of course.\n\n\"I have heard often of your father,\" he said. \"He is one of the local\nsupports of the party to which I have the honour to belong. He\nrepresents one great section of our retainers, our host another. I am\nglad to see such friendship between the two.\" And he smiled elaborately\nfrom Alice to Lord Manorwater.\n\nAlice was uncomfortable. She felt she must be sitting beside some very\ngreat man, and she was tortured by vain efforts to remember the\nmonosyllable which had stood for his name. She did not like his voice,\nand, great man or not, she resented the obvious patronage. He spoke\nwith a touch of the drawl which is currently supposed to belong only to\nthe half-educated classes of England.\n\nShe turned to the boy who sat on the other side of her. The young\ngentleman--his name was Arthur and, apparently, nothing else--was only\ntoo ready to talk. He proceeded to explain, compendiously, his doings of\nthe past week, to which the girl listened politely. Then anxiety got\nthe upper hand, and she asked in a whisper, _a propos_ of nothing in\nparticular, the name of her left-hand neighbour.\n\n\"They call him Stocks,\" said the boy, delighted at the tone of\nconfidence, and was going on to sketch the character of the gentleman in\nquestion when Alice cut him short.\n\n\"Will you take me to fish some day?\" she asked.\n\n\"Any day,\" gasped the hilarious Arthur. \"I'm ready, and I'll tell you\nwhat, I know the very burn--\" and he babbled on happily till he saw that\nMiss Wishart had ceased to listen. It was the first time a pretty girl\nhad shown herself desirous of his company, and he was intoxicated with\nthe thought.\n\nBut Alice felt that she was in some way bound to make the most of Mr.\nStocks, and she set herself heroically to the task. She had never heard\nof him, but then she was not well versed in the minutiae of things\npolitical, and he clearly was a politician. Doubtless to her father his\nname was a household word. So she spoke to him of Glenavelin and its\nbeauties.\n\nHe asked her if she had seen Royston Castle, the residence of his friend\nthe Duke of Sanctamund. When he had stayed there he had been much\nimpressed--\n\nThen she spoke wildly of anything, of books and pictures and\npeople and politics. She found him well-informed, clever, and dogmatic.\nThe culminating point was reached when she embarked on a stray remark\nconcerning certain events then happening in India.\n\nHe contradicted her with a lofty politeness.\n\nShe quoted a book on Kashmir.\n\nHe laughed the authority to scorn. \"Lewis Haystoun?\" he asked. \"What\ncan he know about such things? A wandering dilettante, the worst type\nof the pseudo-culture of our universities. He must see all things\nthrough the spectacles of his upbringing.\"\n\nFortunately he spoke in a low voice, but Lord Manorwater caught the\nname.\n\n\"You are talking about Lewie,\" he said; and then to the table at large,\n\"do you know that Lewie is home? I saw him to-day.\"\n\nBertha Afflint clapped her hands. \"Oh, splendid! When is he coming\nover? I shall drive to Etterick to-morrow. No--bother! I can't go\nto-morrow, I shall go on Wednesday.\"\n\nLady Manorwater opened mild eyes of surprise. \"Why didn't the boy\nwrite?\" And the young Arthur indulged in sundry exclamations, \"Oh,\nripping, I say! What? A clinking good chap, my cousin Lewie!\"\n\n\"Who is this Lewis the well-beloved?\" said Mr. Stocks. \"I was talking\nabout a very different person--Lewis Haystoun, the author of a foolish\nbook on Kashmir.\"\n\n\"Don't you like it?\" said Lord Manorwater, pleasantly. \"Well, it's the\nsame man. He is my nephew, Lewie Haystoun. He lives at Etterick, four\nmiles up the glen. You will see him over here to-morrow or the day\nafter.\"\n\nMr. Stocks coughed loudly to cover his discomfiture. Alice could not\nrepress a little smile of triumph, but she was forbearing and for the\nrest of dinner exerted herself to appease her adversary, listening to\nhis talk with an air of deference which he found entrancing.\n\nMeanwhile it was plain that Lord Manorwater was not quite at ease with\nhis company. Usually a man of brusque and hearty address, he showed his\ndiscomfort by an air of laborious politeness. He was patronized for a\nbrief minute by Mr. Stocks, who set him right on some matter of\nagricultural reform. Happening to be a specialist on the subject and an\nenthusiastic farmer from his earliest days, he took the rebuke with\nproper meekness. The spectacled people were talking earnestly with his\nwife. Arthur was absorbed in his dinner and furtive glances at his\nleft-hand neighbour. There remained Bertha Afflint, whom he had\nhitherto admired with fear. To talk with her was exhausting to frail\nmortality, and he had avoided the pleasure except in moments of\nboisterous bodily and mental health. Now she was his one resource, and\nthe unfortunate man, rashly entering into a contest of wit, found\nhimself badly worsted by her ready tongue. He declared that she was\nworse than her mother, at which the unabashed young woman replied that\nthe superiority of parents was the last retort of the vanquished. He\nregistered an inward vow that Miss Afflint should be used on the morrow\nas a weapon to quell Mr. Stocks.\n\nWhen Alice escaped to the drawing-room she found Bertha and her sister--a\nyounger and ruddier copy--busy with the letters which had arrived by the\nevening post. Lady Manorwater, who reserved her correspondence for the\nlate hours, seized upon the girl and carried her off to sit by the great\nFrench windows from which lawn and park sloped down to the moorland\nloch. She chattered pleasantly about many things, and then innocently\nand abruptly asked her if she had not found her companion at table\namusing.\n\nAlice, unaccustomed to fiction, gave a hesitating \"Yes,\" at which her\nhostess looked pleased. \"He is very clever, you know,\" she said, \"and\nhas been very useful to me on many occasions.\"\n\nAlice asked his occupation.\n\n\"Oh, he has done many things. He has been very brave and quite the\nmaker of his own fortunes. He educated himself, and then I think he\nedited some Nonconformist paper. Then he went into politics, and became\na Churchman. Some old man took a liking to him and left him his money,\nand that was the condition. So I believe he is pretty well off now and\nis waiting for a seat. He has been nursing this constituency, and since\nthe election comes off in a month or two, we asked him down here to\nstay. He has also written a lot of things and he is somebody's private\nsecretary.\" And Lady Manorwater relapsed into vagueness.\n\nThe girl listened without special interest, save that she modified her\nverdict on Mr. Stocks, and allowed, some degree of respect for him to\nfind place in her heart. The fighter in life always appealed to her,\nwhatever the result of his struggle.\n\nThen Lady Manorwater proceeded to hymn his excellences in an\nindeterminate, artificial manner, till the men came into the room, and\nconversation became general. Lord Manorwater made his way to Alice,\nthereby defeating Mr. Stocks, who tended in the same direction. \"Come\noutside and see things, Miss Wishart,\" he said. \"It's a shame to miss a\nGlenavelin evening if it's fine. We must appreciate our rarities.\"\n\nAnd Alice gladly followed him into the still air of dusk which made hill\nand tree seem incredibly distant and the far waters of the lake merge\nwith the moorland in one shimmering golden haze. In the rhododendron\nthickets sparse blooms still remained, and all along by the stream-side\nstood stately lines of yellow iris above the white water-ranunculus.\nThe girl was sensitive to moods of season and weather, and she had\nalmost laughed at the incongruity of the two of them in modern clothes\nin this fit setting for an old tale. Dickon of Glenavelin, the sworn\nfoe of the Lord of Etterick, on such nights as this had ridden up the\nwater with his bands to affront the quiet moonlight. And now his\ndescendant was pointing out dim shapes in the park which he said were\nprize cattle.\n\n\"Whew! what a weariness is civilization!\" said the man, with comical\neyes. \"We have been making talk with difficulty all the evening which\nserves no purpose in the world. Upon my word, my kyloes have the best\nof the bargain. And in a month or so there will be the election and I\nshall have to go and rave--there is no other word for it, Miss\nWishart--rave on behalf of some fool or other, and talk Radicalism which\nwould make your friend Dickon turn in his grave, and be in earnest for\nweeks when I know in the bottom of my heart that I am a humbug and care\nfor none of these things. How lightly politics and such matters sit on\nus all!\"\n\n\"But you know you are talking nonsense,\" said the serious Alice. \"After\nall, these things are the most important, for they mean duty and courage\nand--and--all that sort of thing.\"\n\n\"Right, little woman,\" said he, smiling; \"that is what Stocks tells me\ntwice a day, but, somehow, reproof comes better from you. Dear me!\nit's a sad thing that a middle-aged legislator should be reproved by a\nvery little girl. Come and see the herons. The young birds will be\neverywhere just now.\"\n\nFor an hour in the moonlight they went a-sightseeing, and came back very\ncool and fresh to the open drawing-room window. As they approached they\ncaught an echo of a loud, bland voice saying, \"We must remember our\nmoral responsibilities, my dear Lady Manorwater. Now, for instance--\"\n\nAnd a strange thing happened. For the first time in her life Miss Alice\nWishart felt that the use of loud and solemn words could jar upon her\nfeelings. She set it down resignedly to the evil influence of her\ncompanion.\n\nIn the calm of her bedroom Alice reviewed her recent hours. She\nadmitted to herself that she would enjoy her visit. A healthy and\nactive young woman, the mere prospect of an open-air life gave her\npleasure. Also she liked the people. Mentally she epitomized each of\nthe inmates of the house. Lady Manorwater was all she had pictured\nher--a dear, whimsical, untidy creature, with odd shreds of cleverness\nand a heart of gold. She liked the boy Arthur, and the spectacled\npeople seemed harmless. Bertha she was prepared to adore, for behind\nthe languor and wit she saw a very kindly and capable young woman\nfashioned after her own heart. But of all she liked Lord Manorwater\nbest. She knew that he had a great reputation, that he was said to be\nincessantly laborious, and she had expected some one of her father's\ntype, prim, angular, and elderly. Instead she found a boyish person\nwhom she could scold, and with women reproof is the first stone in the\nfoundation of friendship. On Mr. Stocks she generously reserved her\njudgment, fearing the fate of the hasty.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nUPLAND WATERS\n\n\nWhen Alice woke next morning the cool upland air was flooding through\nthe window, and a great dazzle of sunlight made the world glorious. She\ndressed and ran out to the lawn, then past the loch right to the very\nedge of the waste country. A high fragrance of heath and bog-myrtle was\nin the wind, and the mouth grew cool as after long draughts of spring\nwater. Mists were crowding in the valleys, each bald mountain top shone\nlike a jewel, and far aloft in the heavens were the white streamers of\nmorn. Moorhens were plashing at the loch's edge, and one tall heron\nrose from his early meal. The world was astir with life: sounds of the\n_plonk-plonk_ of rising trout and the endless twitter of woodland birds\nmingled with the far-away barking of dogs and the lowing of the\nfull-uddered cows in the distant meadows. Abashed and enchanted, the\ngirl listened. It was an elfin land where the old witch voices of hill\nand river were not silenced. With the wind in her hair she climbed the\nslope again to the garden ground, where she found a solemn-eyed collie\nsniffing the fragrant wind in his morning stroll.\n\nBreakfast over, the forenoon hung heavy on her hands. It was Lady\nManorwater's custom to let her guests sit idle in the morning and follow\ntheir own desire, but in the afternoon she would plan subtle and\nfar-reaching schemes of enjoyment. It was a common saying that in her\nlarge good-nature she amused people regardless of their own expense.\nShe would light-heartedly make town-bred folk walk twenty miles or bear\nthe toil of infinite drives. But this was after lunch; before, her\nguests might do as they pleased. Lord Manorwater went off to see some\ntenant; Arthur, after vain efforts to decoy Alice into a fishing\nexpedition, went down the stream in a canoe, because to his fool's head\nit seemed the riskiest means of passing the time at his disposal; Bertha\nand her sister were writing letters; the spectacled people had settled\nthemselves below shady trees with voluminous papers and a pile of books.\nAlice alone was idle. She made futile expeditions to the library, and\nreturned with an armful of volumes which she knew in her heart she would\nnever open. She found the deepest and most comfortable chair and placed\nit in a shady place among beeches. But she could not stay there, and\nmust needs wander restlessly about the gardens, plucking flowers and\nlistlessly watching the gardeners at their work.\n\nLunch-time found this young woman in a slightly irritable frame of mind.\nThe cause direct and indirect was Mr. Stocks, who had found her alone,\nand had saddled her with his company for the space of an hour and a\nhalf. His vein had been _badinage_ of the serious and reproving kind, and\nthe girl had been bored to distraction. But a misspent hour is soon\nforgotten, and the sight of her hostess's cheery face would have\nrestored her to good humour had it not been for a thought which could\nnot be exorcised. She knew of Lady Manorwater's reputation as an\ninveterate matchmaker, and in some subtle way the suspicion came to her\nthat that goddess had marked herself as a quarry. She found herself\nnext Mr. Stocks at meals, she had already listened to his eulogy from\nher hostess's own lips, and to her unquiet fancy it seemed as if the\nothers stood back that they two might be together. Brought up in an\natmosphere of commerce, she was perfectly aware that she was a desirable\nmatch for an embryo politician, and that sooner or later she would be\nmistress of many thousands. The thought was a barbed vexation. To Mr.\nStocks she had been prepared to extend the tolerance of a happy\naloofness; now she found that she was driven to dislike him with all the\nbitterness of unwelcome proximity.\n\nThe result of such thoughts was that after lunch she disregarded her\nhostess's preparations and set out for a long hill walk. Like all\nperfectly healthy people, much exercise was as welcome to her as food\nand sleep; ten miles were refreshing; fifteen miles in an afternoon an\nexaltation. She reached the moor beyond the policies, and, once past\nthis rushy wilderness, came to the Avelin-side and a single plank bridge\nwhich she crossed lightly without a tremor. Then came the highway, and\nthen a long planting of firs, and last of all the dip of a rushing\nstream pouring down from the hills in a lonely wooded hollow. The girl\nloved to explore, and here was a field ripe for adventure.\n\nSoon she grew flushed with the toil and the excitement; climbing the bed\nof the stream was no child's play, for ugly corners had to be passed,\nslippery rocks to be skirted, and many breakneck leaps to be effected.\nHer spirits rose as the spray from little falls brushed her face and the\nthick screen of the birches caught in her hair. When she reached a\nvantage-rock and looked down on the chain of pools and rapids by which\nshe had come, a cry of delight broke from her lips. This was living,\nthis was the zest of life! The upland wind cooled her brow; she washed\nher hands in a rocky pool and arranged her tangled tresses. What did\nshe care for Mr. Stocks or any man? He was far down on the lowlands\ntalking his pompous nonsense; she was on the hills with the sky above\nher and the breeze of heaven around her, free, sovereign, the queen of\nan airy land.\n\nWith fresh wonder she scrambled on till the trees began to grow sparser\nand an upland valley opened in view. Now the burn was quiet, running in\nlong shining shallows and falling over little rocks into deep brown\npools where the trout darted. On either side rose the gates of the\nvalley--two craggy knolls each with a few trees on its face. Beyond was\na green lawnlike place with a great confusion of blue mountains hemmed\naround its head. Here, if anywhere, primeval peace had found its\ndwelling, and Alice, her eyes bright with pleasure, sat on a green\nknoll, too rapt with the sight for word or movement.\n\nThen very slowly, like an epicure lingering at a feast, she walked up\nthe banks of the burn, now high above a trough of rock, now down in a\ngreen winding hollow. Suddenly she came on the spirits of the place in\nthe shape of two boys down on their faces groping among the stones of a\npool.\n\nOne was very small and tattered, one about sixteen; both were barefoot\nand both were wet and excited. \"Tam, ye stot, ye've let the muckle yin\naff again,\" groaned the smaller. \"Oh, be canny, man! If we grip him\nit'll be the biggest trout that the laird will have in his basket.\" The\nelder boy, who was bearing the heat and burden of the work, could only\ngroan \"Heather!\" at intervals. It seemed to be his one exclamation.\n\nNow it happened that the two ragamuffins lifted their eyes and saw to\ntheir amazement a girl walking on the bank above them, a girl who smiled\ncomrade-like on them and seemed in no way surprised. They propped\nthemselves on their elbows and stared. \"Heather!\" they ejaculated in\none breath. Then they, too, grinned broadly, for it was impossible to\nresist so good-humoured an intruder. She held her head high and walked\nlike a queen, till a turn of the water hid her. \"It's a wumman,\" gasped\nthe smaller boy. \"And she's terrible bonny,\" commented the more\ncritical brother. Then the two fell again to the quest of the great\ntrout.\n\nMeanwhile the girl pursued her way till she came to a fall where the\nbank needed warier climbing. As she reached the top a little flushed\nand panting, she became conscious that the upland valley was not without\ninhabitants. For, not six paces off, stood a man's figure, his back\nturned towards her, and his mind apparently set on mending a piece of\ntackle.\n\nShe stood for a moment hesitating. How could she pass without being\nseen? The man was blissfully unconscious of her presence, and as he\nworked he whistled Schubert's \"Wohin,\" and whistled it very badly. Then\nhe fell to apostrophizing his tackle, and then he grew irritable.\n\"Somebody come and keep this thing taut,\" he cried. \"Tam, Jock! where\non earth are you?\"\n\nThe thing in question was lying at Alice's feet in wavy coils.\n\n\"Jock, you fool, where are you?\" cried the man, but he never looked\nround and went on biting and tying. Then an impulse took the girl and\nshe picked up the line. \"That's right,\" cried the man, \"pull it as\ntight as you can,\" and Alice tugged heroically at the waterproof silk.\nShe felt horribly nervous, and was conscious that she must look a very\nflushed and untidy young barbarian. Many times she wanted to drop it\nand run away, but the thought of the menaces against the absent Jock and\nof her swift discovery deterred her. When he was done with her help he\nmight go on working and never look round. Then she would escape\nunnoticed down the burn.\n\nBut no such luck befell her. With a satisfied tug he pronounced the\nthing finished and wheeled round to regard his associates. \"Now, you\nyoung wretches--\" and the words froze on his lips, for in the place of\ntwo tatterdemalion boys he saw a young girl holding his line limply and\nsmiling with much nervousness.\n\n\"Oh,\" he cried, and then became dumb and confused. He was shy and\nunhappy with women, save the few whom he had known from childhood. The\ngirl was no better. She had blushed deeply, and was now minutely\nscanning the stones in the burn. Then she raised her eyes, met his, and\nthe difficulty was solved by both falling into fits of deep laughter.\nShe was the first to speak.\n\n\"I am so sorry I surprised you. I did not see you till I was close to\nyou, and then you were abusing somebody so terribly that to stop such\nlanguage I had to stop and help you. I saw Tam and Jock at a pool a\nlong way down, so they couldn't hear you, you know.\"\n\n\"And I'm very much obliged to you. You held it far better than Tam or\nJock would have done. But how did you get up here?\"\n\n\"I climbed up the burn,\" said Alice simply, putting up a hand to confine\na wandering tress. The young man saw a small, very simply dressed girl,\nwith a flushed face and bright, deep eyes. The small white hat crowned\na great tangle of wonderful reddish gold hair. She held herself with\nthe grace which is born of natural health and no modish training; the\nstrong hazel stick, the scratched shoes, and the wet fringes of her gown\nshowed how she had spent the afternoon. The young man, having received\nan excellent education, thought of Dryads and Oreads.\n\nAlice for her part saw a strong, well-knit being, with a brown,\nclean-shaven face, a straight nose, and a delicate, humorous mouth. He\nhad large grey eyes, very keen, quizzical, and kindly. His raiment was\ndisgraceful--an old knickerbocker suit with a ruinous Norfolk jacket,\npatched at the elbows and with leather at wrist and shoulder.\nApparently he scorned the June sun, for he had no cap. His pockets\nseemed bursting with tackle, and a discarded basket lay on the ground.\nThe whole figure pleased her, its rude health, simplicity, and disorder.\nThe atrocious men who sometimes came to her father's house had been\nmiracles of neatness, and Mr. Stocks was wont to robe his person in the\nmost faultless of shooting suits.\n\nA fugitive memory began to haunt the girl. She had met or heard of this\nman before. The valley was divided between Glenavelin and Etterick. He\nwas not the Doctor, and he was not the minister. Might not he be that\nLewie, the well-beloved, whose praises she had heard consistently sung\nsince her arrival? It pleased her to think that she had been the first\nto meet the redoubtable young man.\n\nTo them there entered the two boys, the younger dangling a fish. \"It is\nthe big trout ye lost,\" he cried. \"We guddled 'um. We wad has gotten\n'um afore, but a wumman frichted 'um.\" Then turning unabashed to Alice,\nhe said in accusing tones, \"That's the wumman!\"\n\nThe elder boy gently but firmly performed on his brother the operation\nknown as \"scragging.\" It was a subdued spirit which emerged from the\nfraternal embrace.\n\n\"Pit the fush in the basket, Tam,\" said he, \"and syne gang away wide up\nthe hill till I cry ye back.\" The tones implied that his younger brother\nwas no fit company for two gentlemen and a lady.\n\n\"I won't spoil your fishing,\" said Alice, fearing fratricidal strife.\n\"You are fishing up, so I had better go down the burn again.\" And with a\ndignified nod to the others she turned to go.\n\nJock sprang forward with a bound and proceeded to stone the small Tam\nup the hill. He coursed that young gentleman like a dog, bidding him\n\"come near,\" or \"gang wide,\" or \"lie down there,\" to all of which the\nculprit, taking the sport in proper spirit, gaily responded.\n\n\"I think you had better not go down the burn,\" said the man\nreflectively. \"You should keep the dry hillside. It is safer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not afraid,\" said the girl, laughing.\n\n\"But then I might want to fish down, and the trout are very shy there,\"\nsaid he, lying generously.\n\n\"Well, I won't then, but please tell me where Glenavelin is, for the\nstream-side is my only direction.\"\n\n\"You are staying there?\" he asked with a pleased face. \"We shall meet\nagain, for I shall be over to-morrow. That fence on the hillside is\ntheir march, and if you follow it you will come to the footbridge on the\nAvelin. Many thanks for taking Jock's place and helping me.\"\n\nHe watched her for a second as she lightly jumped the burn and climbed\nthe peaty slope. Then he turned to his fishing, and when Alice looked\nback from the vantage-ground of the hill shoulder she saw a figure\nbending intently below a great pool. She was no coquette, but she could\nnot repress a tinge of irritation at so callous and self-absorbed a\nyoung man. Another would have been profuse in thanks and would have\naccompanied her to point out the road, or in some way or other would\nhave declared his appreciation of her presence. He might have told her\nhis name, and then there would have been a pleasant informal\nintroduction, and they could have talked freely. If he came to\nGlenavelin to-morrow, she would have liked to appear as already an\nacquaintance of so popular a guest.\n\nBut such thoughts did not long hold their place. She was an honest\nyoung woman, and she readily confessed that fluent manners and the air\nof the _cavaliere servente_ were things she did not love. Carelessness\nsuited well with a frayed jacket and the companionship of a hill burn\nand two ragged boys. So, comforting her pride with proverbs, she\nreturned to Glenavelin to find the place deserted save for dogs, and in\ntheir cheering presence read idly till dinner.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAFTERNOON IN A GARDEN\n\n\nThe gardens of Glenavelin have an air of antiquity beyond the dwelling,\nfor there the modish fashions of another century have been followed with\nenthusiasm. There are clipped yews and long arched avenues, bowers and\nsummer-houses of rustic make, and a terraced lawn fringed with a\nGeorgian parapet. A former lord had kept peacocks innumerable, and\nsomething of the tradition still survived. Set in the heart of hilly\nmoorlands, it was like a cameo gem in a tartan plaid, a piece of old\nVauxhall or Ranelagh in an upland vale. Of an afternoon sleep reigned\nsupreme. The shapely immobile trees, the grey and crumbling stone, the\nlone green walks vanishing into a bosky darkness were instinct with the\nquiet of ages. It needed but Lady Prue with her flounces and furbelows\nand Sir Pertinax with his cane and buckled shoon to re-create the\nancient world before good Queen Anne had gone to her rest.\n\nIn one of the shadiest corners of a great lawn Lady Manorwater sat\nmaking tea. Bertha, with a broad hat shading her eyes, dozed over a\nmagazine in a deck-chair. That morning she and Alice had broken the\nconvention of the house and gone riding in the haughlands till lunch.\nNow she suffered the penalty and dozed, but her companion was very wide\nawake, being a tireless creature who knew not lethargy. Besides, there\nwas sufficient in prospect to stir her curiosity. Lady Manorwater had\nannounced some twenty times that day that her nephew Lewis would come to\ntea, and Alice, knowing the truth of the prophecy, was prepared to\nreceive him.\n\nThe image of the forsaken angler remained clear in her memory, and she\nconfessed to herself that he interested her. The girl had no\nconnoisseur's eye for character; her interest was the frank and\nunabashed interest in a somewhat mysterious figure who was credited by\nall his friends with great gifts and a surprising amiability. After\nbreakfast she had captured one of the spectacled people, whose name was\nHoddam. He was a little shy man, one of the unassuming tribe of\nstudents by whom all the minor intellectual work of the world is done,\nand done well. It is a great class, living in the main in red-brick\nvillas on the outskirts of academic towns, marrying mild blue-stockings,\nworking incessantly, and finally attaining to the fame of mention in\nprefaces and foot-notes, and a short paragraph in the _Times_ at the\nlast.... Mr. Hoddam did not seek the company of one who was young,\npretty, an heiress, and presumably flippant, but he was flattered when\nshe plainly sought him.\n\n\"Mr. Lewis Haystoun is coming here this afternoon,\" she had announced.\n\"Do you know him?\"\n\n\"I have read his book,\" said her victim.\n\n\"Yes, but did you not know him at Oxford? You were there with him, were\nyou not?\"\n\n\"Yes, we were there together. I knew him by sight, of course, for he\nwas a very well-known person. But, you see, we belonged to very\ndifferent sets.\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\" asked the blunt Alice.\n\n\"Well, you see,\" began Mr. Hoddam awkwardly--absolute honesty was one\nof his characteristics--\"he was very well off, and he lived with a\nsporting set, and he was very exclusive.\"\n\n\"But I thought he was clever--I thought he was rather brilliant?\"\n\n\"Oh, he was! Indubitably! He got everything he wanted, but then he got\nthem easily and had a lot of time for other things, whereas most of us\nhad not a moment to spare. He got the best First of his year and the\nSt. Chad's Fellowship, but I think he cared far more about winning the\n'Varsity Grind. Men who knew him said he was an extremely good fellow,\nbut he had scores of rich sporting friends, and nobody else ever got to\nknow him. I have heard him speak often, and his manner gave one the\nimpression that he was a tremendous swell, you know, and rather\nconceited. People used to think him a sort of universal genius who\ncould do everything. I suppose he was quite the ablest man that had\nbeen there for years, but I should think he would succeed ultimately as\nthe man of action and not as the scholar.\"\n\n\"You give him a most unlovely character,\" said the girl.\n\n\"I don't mean to. I own to being entirely fascinated by him. But he\nwas never, I think, really popular. He was supposed to be intolerant of\nmediocrity; and also he used to offend quite honest, simple-minded\npeople by treating their beliefs very cavalierly. I used to compare him\nwith Raleigh or Henri IV.--the proud, confident man of action.\"\n\nAlice had pondered over Mr. Hoddam's confessions and was prepared to\nreceive the visitor with coldness. The vigorous little democrat in her\nhated arrogance. Before, if she had asked herself what type on earth\nshe hated most, she would have decided for the unscrupulous, proud man.\nAnd yet this Lewis must be lovable. That brown face had infinite\nattractiveness, and she trusted Lady Manorwater's acuteness and goodness\nof heart.\n\nLord Manorwater had gone off on some matter of business and taken the\nyounger Miss Afflint with him. As Alice looked round the little\nassembly on the lawn, she felt for the first time the insignificance of\nthe men. The large Mr. Stocks was not at his best in such\nsurroundings. He was the typical townsman, and bore with him wherever\nhe went an atmosphere of urban dust and worry. He hungered for\nostentation, he could only talk well when he felt that he impressed his\nhearers; Bertha, who was not easily impressed, he shunned like a plague.\nThe man, reflected the censorious Alice, had no shades or half-tones in\nhis character; he was all bald, strong, and crude. Now he was talking\nto his hostess with the grace of the wise man unbending.\n\n\"I shall be pleased indeed to meet your nephew,\" he said. \"I feel sure\nthat we have many interests in common. Do you say he lives near?\"\n\nLady Manorwater, ever garrulous on family matters, readily enlightened\nhim. \"Etterick is his, and really all the land round here. We simply\nlive on a patch in the middle of it. The shooting is splendid, and\nLewie is a very keen sportsman. His mother was my husband's sister, and\ndied when he was born. He is wonderfully unspoiled to have had such a\nlonely boyhood.\"\n\n\"How did the family get the land?\" he asked. It was a matter which\ninterested him, for democratic politician though he was, he looked\nalways forward to the day when he should own a pleasant country\nproperty, and forget the troubles of life in the Nirvana of the\nrespectable.\n\n\"Oh, they've had it for ages. They are a very old family, you know, and\nlook down upon us as parvenus. They have been everything in their\nday--soldiers, statesmen, lawyers; and when we were decent merchants in\nAbbeykirk three centuries ago, they were busy making history. When you\ngo to Etterick you must see the pictures. There is a fine one by\nJameson of the Haystoun who fought with Montrose, and Raeburn painted\nmost of the Haystouns of his time. They were a very handsome race, at\nleast the men; the women were too florid and buxom for my taste.\"\n\n\"And this Lewis--is he the only one of the family?\"\n\n\"The very last, and of course he does his best to make away with himself\nby risking his precious life in Hindu Kush or Tibet or somewhere.\" Her\nladyship was geographically vague.\n\n\"What a pity he does not realize his responsibilities!\" said the\npolitician. \"He might do so much.\"\n\nBut at the moment it dawned upon the speaker that the shirker of\nresponsibilities was appearing in person. There strode towards them,\nacross the lawn, a young man and two dogs.\n\n\"How do you do, Aunt Egeria?\" he cried, and he caught her small woman's\nhand in a hard brown one and smiled on the little lady.\n\nBertha Afflint had flung her magazine to the winds and caught his\navailable left hand. \"Oh, Lewie, you wretch! how glad we are to see\nyou again.\" Meantime the dogs performed a solemn minuet around her\nladyship's knees.\n\nThe young man, when he had escaped from the embraces of his friends,\nturned to the others. He seemed to recognize two of them, for he shook\nhands cordially with the two spectacled people. \"Hullo, Hoddam, how are\nyou? And Imrie! Who would have thought of finding you here?\" And he\npoured forth a string of kind questions till the two beamed with\npleasure.\n\nThen Alice heard dimly words of introduction: \"Miss Wishart, Mr.\nHaystoun,\" and felt herself bowing automatically. She actually felt\nnervous. The disreputable fisher of the day before was in ordinary\nriding garments of fair respectability. He recognized her at once, but\nhe, too, seemed to lose for a moment his flow of greetings. His tone\ninsensibly changed to a conventional politeness, and he asked her some\nof the stereotyped questions with which one greets a stranger. She felt\nsharply that she was a stranger to whom the courteous young man assumed\nmore elaborate manners. The freedom of the day before seemed gone. She\nconsoled herself with the thought that whereas then she had been warm,\nflushed, and untidy, she was now very cool and elegant in her prettiest\nfrock.\n\nThen Mr. Stocks arose and explained that he was delighted to meet Mr.\nLewis Haystoun, that he knew of his reputation, and hoped to have some\npleasant talk on matters dear to the heart of both. At which Lewis\nshunned the vacant seat between Bertha and that gentleman, and stretched\nhimself on the lawn beside Alice's chair. A thrill of pleasure entered\nthe girl's heart, to her own genuine surprise.\n\n\"Are Tam and Jock at peace now?\" she asked.\n\n\"Tam and Jock are never at peace. Jock is sedate and grave and old for\nhis years, while Tam is simply a human collie. He has the same endearing\nmanners and irresponsible mind. I had to fish him out of several\nrock-pools after you left.\"\n\nAlice laughed, and Lady Manorwater said in wonder, \"I didn't know you\nhad met Lewie before, Alice.\"\n\n\"Miss Wishart and I forgathered accidentally at the Midburn yesterday,\"\nsaid the man.\n\n\"Oh, you went there,\" cried the aggrieved Arthur, \"and you never told\nme! Why, it is the best water about here, and yesterday was a\nfirst-rate day. What did you catch, Lewie?\"\n\n\"Twelve pounds--about four dozen trout.\"\n\n\"Listen to that! And to think that that great hulking chap got all the\nsport!\" And the boy intercepted his cousin's tea by way of retaliation.\n\nThen Mr. Stocks had his innings, with Lady Manorwater for company, and\nLewis was put through a strict examination on his doings for the past\nyears.\n\n\"What made you choose that outlandish place, my dear?\" asked his aunt.\n\n\"Oh, partly the chance of a shot at big game, partly a restless interest\nin frontier politics which now and then seizes me. But really it was\nWratislaw's choice.\"\n\n\"Do you know Wratislaw?\" asked Mr. Stocks abruptly.\n\n\"Tommy?--why, surely! My best of friends. He had got his fellowship\nsome years before I went up, but I often saw him at Oxford, and he has\nhelped me innumerable times.\" The young man spoke eagerly, prepared to\nextend warm friendship to any acquaintance of his friend's.\n\n\"He and I have sometimes crossed swords,\" said Mr. Stocks pompously.\n\nLewis nodded, and forbore to ask which had come off the better.\n\n\"He is, of course, very able,\" said Mr. Stocks, making a generous\nadmission.\n\nHis hearer wondered why he should be told of a man's ability when he had\nspoken of him as his friend.\n\n\"Have you heard much of him lately?\" he asked. \"We corresponded\nregularly when I was abroad, but of course he never would speak about\nhimself, and I only saw him for a short time last week in London.\"\n\nThe gentleman addressed waved a deprecating hand.\n\n\"He has had no popular recognition. Such merits as he has are too aloof\nto touch the great popular heart. But we who believe in the people and\nwork for them have found him a bitter enemy. The idle, academic,\nsuperior person, whatever his gifts, is a serious hindrance to honest\nwork,\" said the popular idol.\n\n\"I shouldn't call him idle or superior,\" said Lewis quietly. \"I have\nseen hard workers, but I have never seen anything like Tommy. He is a\nperfect mill-horse, wasting his fine talent on a dreary routine, merely\nbecause he is conscientious and nobody can do it so well.\"\n\nHe always respected honesty, so he forbore to be irritated with this\nassured speaker.\n\nBut Alice interfered to prevent jarring.\n\n\"I read your book, Mr. Haystoun. What a time you must have had! You\nsay that north of Bardur or some place like that there are two hundred\nmiles of utterly unknown land till you come to Russian territory. I\nshould have thought that land important. Why doesn't some one penetrate\nit?\n\n\"Well, for various causes. It is very high land and the climate is not\nmild. Also, there are abundant savage tribes with a particularly\neffective crooked kind of knife. And, finally, our Government\ndiscourages British enterprise there, and Russia would do the same as\nsoon as she found out.\"\n\n\"But what a chance for an adventurer!\" said Alice, with a face aglow.\n\nLewis looked up at the slim figure in the chair above him, and caught\nthe gleam of dark eyes.\n\n\"Well, some day, Miss Wishart--who knows?\" he said slowly and\ncarelessly.\n\nBut three people looked at him, Bertha, his aunt, and Mr. Stocks, and\nthree people saw the same thing. His face had closed up like a steel\ntrap. It was no longer the kindly, humorous face of the sportsman and\ngood fellow, but the keen, resolute face of the fighter, the schemer,\nthe man of daring. The lines about his chin and brow seemed to tighten\nand strengthen and steel, while the grey eyes had for a moment a glint\nof fire.\n\nThree people never forgot that face. It was a pity that the lady at his\nside was prevented from seeing it by her position, for otherwise life\nmight have gone differently with both. But the things which we call\nchance are in the power of the Fateful Goddesses who reserve their right\nto juggle with poor humanity.\n\nAlice only heard the words, but they pleased her. Mr. Stocks fell\nfarther into the background of disfavour. She had imagination and fire\nas well as common sense. It was the purple and fine gold which first\ncaught her fancy, though on reflection she might decide for the\nhodden-grey. So she was very gracious to the young adventurer. And\nArthur's brows grew dark as Erebus.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nLewis rode home in the late afternoon to Etterick in a haze of golden\nweather with an abstracted air and a slack bridle. A small, dainty\nfigure tripped through the mazes of his thoughts. This man, usually\noblivious of woman's presence, now mooned like any schoolboy. Those\nfresh young eyes and the glory of that hair! And to think that once he\nhad sworn by black!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nA CONFERENCE OF THE POWERS\n\n\nIt was the sultriest of weather in London--days when the city lay in a\nfog of heat, when the paving cracked, and the brow was damp from the\nslightest movement and the mind of the stranger was tortured by the\nthought of airy downs and running rivers. The leaves in the Green Park\nwere withered and dusty, the window-boxes in Mayfair had a tarnished\nlook, and horse and man moved with unwilling languor. A tall young man\nin a grey frockcoat searched the street for shadow, and finding none\nentered the doorway of a club which promised coolness.\n\nMr. George Winterham removed his top-hat, had a good wash, and then\nsought the smoking room. Seen to better advantage, he was sufficiently\ngood-looking, with an elegant if somewhat lanky frame, a cheerful\ncountenance, and a great brown moustache which gave him the air\nmilitary. But he was no soldier, being indeed that anomalous creature,\nthe titular barrister, who shows his profession by rarely entering the\nchambers and by an ignorance of law more profound than Necessity's.\n\nHe found the shadiest corner of the smoking room and ordered the coolest\ndrink he could think of. Then he smiled, for he saw advancing to him\nacross the room another victim of the weather. This was a small, thin\nman, with a finely-shaped dark head and the most perfectly-fitting\nclothes. He had been deep in a review, but at the sight of the wearied\ngiant in the corner he had forgotten his interest in the \"Entomology of\nthe Riviera.\" He looked something of the artist or the man of letters,\nbut in truth he had no taint of Bohemianism about him, being a very\nrespectable person and a rising politician. His name was Arthur\nMordaunt, but because it was the fashion at the time for a certain class\nof people to address each other in monosyllables, his friends invariably\nknew him as \"John.\"\n\nHe dropped into a chair and regarded his companion with half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Well, John. Dished, eh? Most infernal heat I ever endured! I can't\nstand it, you know. I'll have to go away.\"\n\n\"Think,\" said the other, \"think that at this moment somewhere in the\ncountry there are great, cool, deep woods and lakes and waterfalls, and\nwe might be sitting in flannels instead of being clothed in these\ngarments of sin.\"\n\n\"Think,\" said George, \"of nothing of the kind. Think of high upland\nglens and full brown rivers, and hillsides where there is always wind.\nWhy do I tantalize myself and talk to a vexatious idiot like you?\"\n\nThis young man had a deep voice, a most emphatic manner of speech, and a\ntrick of cheerfully abusing his friends which they rather liked than\notherwise.\n\n\"And why should I sit opposite six feet of foolishness which can give me\nno comfort? Whew! But I think I am getting cool at last. I have sworn\nto make use of my first half-hour of reasonable temperature and\nconsequent clearness of mind to plan flight from this place.\"\n\n\"May I come with you, my pretty maid? I am hideously sick of July in\ntown. I know Mabel will never forgive me, but I must risk it.\"\n\nMabel was the young man's sister, and the friendship between the two was\na perpetual joke. As a small girl she had been wont to con eagerly her\nbrother's cricketing achievements, for George had been a famous\ncricketer, and annually went crazy with excitement at the Eton and\nHarrow match. She exercised a maternal care over him, and he stood in\nwholesome fear of her and ordered his doings more or less at her\njudgment. Now she was married, but she still supervised her tall\nbrother, and the victim made no secret of the yoke.\n\nSuddenly Arthur jumped to his feet. \"I say, what about Lewis Haystoun?\nHe is home now, somewhere in Scotland. Have you heard a word about\nhim?\"\n\n\"He has never written,\" groaned George, but he took out a pocket-book\nand shook therefrom certain newspaper cuttings. \"The people I employ\nsent me these about him to-day.\" And he laid them out on his knee.\n\nThe first of them was long, and consisted of a belated review of Mr.\nHaystoun's book. George, who never read such things, handed it to\nArthur, who glanced over the lines and returned it. The second\nexplained in correct journalese that the Manorwater family had returned\nto Glenavelin for the summer and autumn, and that Mr. Lewis Haystoun\nwas expected at Etterick shortly. The third recorded the opening of a\nbazaar in the town of Gledsmuir which Mr. Haystoun had patronised,\n\"looking,\" said the fatuous cutting, \"very brown and distinguished after\nhis experiences in the East.\"--\"Whew!\" said George. \"Poor beggar, to\nhave such stuff written about him!\"--The fourth discussed the possible\nretirement of Sir Robert Merkland, the member for Gledsmuir, and his\npossible successor. Mr. Haystoun's name was mentioned, \"though\nindeed,\" said the wiseacre, \"that gentleman has never shown any decided\nleanings to practical politics. We understand that the seat will be\ncontested in the Radical interest by Mr. Albert Stocks, the well-known\nwriter and lecturer.\"\n\n\"You know everybody, John. Who's the fellow?\" George asked.\n\n\"Oh, a very able man indeed, one of the best speakers we have. I should\nlike to see a fight between him and Lewie: they would not get on with\neach other. This Stocks is a sort of living embodiment of the irritable\nRadical conscience, a very good thing in its way, but not quite in\nLewie's style.\"\n\nThe fifth cutting mentioned the presence of Mr. Haystoun at three\ngarden-parties, and hinted the possibility of a mistress soon to be at\nEtterick.\n\nGeorge lay back in his chair gasping. \"I never thought it would come to\nthis. I always thought Lewie the least impressionable of men. I wonder\nwhat sort of woman he has fallen in love with. But it may not be true.\"\n\n\"We'll pray that it isn't true. But I was never quite sure of him. You\nknow there was always an odd romantic strain in the man. The ordinary\nsmart, pretty girl, who adorns the end of a dinner-table and makes an\nadmirable mistress of a house, he would never think twice about. But\nfor all his sanity Lewie has many cranks, and a woman might get him on\nthat side.\"\n\n\"Don't talk of it. I can picture the horrid reality. He will marry\nsome thin-lipped creature who will back him in all his madness, and his\nfriends will have to bid him a reluctant farewell. Or, worse still,\nthere are scores of gushing, sentimental girls who might capture him. I\nwish old Wratislaw were here to ask him what he thinks, for he knows\nLewie better than any of us. Is he a member here?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, he is a member, but I don't think he comes much. You people\nare too frivolous for him.\"\n\n\"Well, that is all the good done by subscribing to a news-cutting agency\nfor news of one's friends. I feel as low as ditch water. There is that\nidiot who goes off to the ends of the earth for three years, and when he\ncomes back his friends get no good of him for the confounded women.\"\nGeorge echoed the ancient complaint which is doubtless old as David and\nJonathan.\n\nThen these two desolated young men, in view of their friend's defection,\nwere full of sad memories, much as relations after a funeral hymn the\nacts of the deceased.\n\nGeorge lit a cigar and smoked it savagely. \"So that is the end of\nLewis! And to think I knew the fool at school and college and couldn't\nmake a better job of him than this! Do you remember, John, how we used\nto call him 'Vaulting Ambition,' because he won the high jump and was a\ncocky beggar in general?\"\n\n\"And do you remember when he got his First, and they wanted him to stand\nfor a fellowship, but he was keen to get out of England and travel? Do\nyou remember that last night at Heston, when he told us all he was going\nto do, and took a bet with Wratislaw about it?\"\n\nIt is probable that this sad elegy would have continued for hours, had\nnot a servant approached with letters, which he distributed, two to\nArthur Mordaunt and one to Mr. Winterham. A close observer might have\nseen that two of the envelopes were identical. Arthur slipped one into\nhis pocket, but tore open the other and read.\n\n\"It's from Lewie,\" he cried. \"He wants me down there next week at\nEtterick. He says he is all alone and crazy to see old friends again.\"\n\n\"Mine's the same!\" said George, after puzzling out Mr. Haystoun's by no\nmeans legible writing. \"I say, John, of course we'll go. It's the very\nchance we were wishing for.\"\n\nThen he added with a cheerful face, \"I begin to think better of human\nnature. Here were we abusing the poor man as a defaulter, and ten\nminutes after he heaps coals of fire on our heads. There can't be much\ntruth in what that newspaper says, or he wouldn't want his friends down\nto spoil sport.\"\n\n\"I wonder what he'll be like? Wratislaw saw him in town, but only for a\nlittle, and he notices nothing. He's rather famous now, you know, and\nwe may expect to find him very dignified and wise. He'll be able to\nteach us most things, and we'll have to listen with proper humility.\"\n\n\"I'll give you fifty to one he's nothing of the kind,\" said George. \"He\nhas his faults like us all, but they don't run in that line. No, no,\nLewie will be modest enough. He may have the pride of Lucifer at heart,\nbut he would never show it. His fault is just this infernal modesty,\nwhich makes him shirk fighting some blatant ass or publishing his merits\nto the world.\"\n\nArthur looked curiously at his companion. Mr. Winterham was loved of\nhis friends as the best of good fellows, but to the staid and rising\npolitician he was not a person for serious talk. Hence, when he found\nhim saying very plainly what had for long been a suspicion of his own,\nhe was willing to credit him with a new acuteness.\n\n\"You know I've always backed Lewie to romp home some day,\" went on the\nyoung man. \"He has got it in him to do most things, if he doesn't jib\nand bolt altogether.\"\n\n\"I don't see why you should talk of your friends as if they were\nracehorses or prize dogs.\"\n\n\"Well, there's a lot of truth in the metaphor. You know yourself what a\nmess of it he might make. Say some good woman got hold of him--some\ngood woman, for we will put aside the horrible suggestion of the\nadventuress. I suppose he'd be what you call a 'good husband.' He would\nbecome a magistrate and a patron of local agricultural societies and\nflower shows. And eveybody would talk about him as a great success in\nlife; but we--you and I and Tommy--who know him better, would feel that\nit was all a ghastly failure.\"\n\nMr. Lewis Haystoun's character erred in its simplicity, for it was at\nthe mercy of every friend for comment.\n\n\"What makes you dread the women so?\" asked Arthur with a smile.\n\n\"I don't dread 'em. They are all that's good, and a great deal better\nthan most men. But then, you know, if you get a man really first-class\nhe's so much better than all but the very best women that you've got to\nlook after him. To ordinary beggars like myself it doesn't matter a\nstraw, but I won't have Lewie throwing himself away.\"\n\n\"Then is the ancient race of the Haystouns to disappear from the earth?\"\n\n\"Oh, there are women fit for him, sure enough, but you won't find them\nat every garden party. Why, to find the proper woman would be the\nmaking of the man, and I should never have another doubt about him. But\nI am afraid. He's a deal too kindly and good-natured, and he'd marry a\ngirl to-morrow merely to please her. And then some day quite casually\nhe would come across the woman who was meant by Providence for him, and\nthere would be the devil to pay and the ruin of one good man. I don't\nmean that he'd make a fool of himself or anything of that sort, for he's\nnot a cad; but in the middle of his pleasant domesticity he would get a\nglimpse of what he might have been, and those glimpses are not\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"Why, George, you are getting dithyrambic,\" said Arthur, still smiling,\nbut with a new vague respect in his heart.\n\n\"For you cannot harness the wind or tie--tie the bonds of the wild ass,\"\nsaid George, with an air of quotation. \"At any rate, we're going to\nlook after him. He is a good chap and I've got to see him through.\"\n\nFor Mr. Winterham, who was very much like other men, whose language was\nfree, and who respected few things indeed in the world, had unfailing\ntenderness for two beings--his sister and his friend.\n\nThe two young men rose, yawned, and strolled out into the hall. They\nscanned carelessly the telegram boards. Arthur pointed a finger to a\nmessage typed in a corner.\n\n\"That will make a good deal of difference to Wratislaw.\"\n\nGeorge read: \"The death is announced, at his residence in Hampshire, of\nEarl Beauregard. His lordship had reached the age of eighty-five, and\nhad been long in weak health. He is succeeded by his son the Right Hon.\nLord Malham, the present Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\"\n\n\"It means that if Wratislaw's party get back with a majority after\nAugust, and if Wratislaw gets the under-secretaryship as most people\nexpect, then, with his chief in the Lords, he will be rather an\nimportant figure in the Commons.\"\n\n\"And I suppose his work will be pretty lively,\" said George. He had\nbeen reading some of the other telegrams, which were, as a rule,\nhysterical messages by way of foreign capitals, telling of Russian\npreparations in the East.\n\n\"Oh, lively, yes. But I've confidence in Tommy. I wish the Fate which\ndecides men's politics had sent him to our side. He knows more about\nthe thing than any one else, and he knows his own mind, which is rare\nenough. But it's too hot for serious talk. I suppose my seat is safe\nenough in August, but I don't relish the prospect of a three weeks'\nfight. Wratislaw, lucky man, will not be opposed. I suppose he'll come\nup and help Lewis to make hay of Stock's chances. It's a confounded\nshame. I shall go and talk for him.\"\n\nOn the steps of the club both men halted, and looked up and down the\nsultry white street. The bills of the evening papers were plastered in\na row on the pavement, and the glaring pink and green still further\nincreased the dazzle. After the cool darkness within each shaded his\neyes and blinked.\n\n\"This settles it,\" said George. \"I shall wire to Lewie to-night.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said the other; \"and to-morrow evening we'll be in that cool\ngreen Paradise of a glen. Think of it! Meantime I shall grill through\nanother evening in the House, and pair.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nPASTORAL\n\n\nI\n\nA July morning had dawned over the Dreichill, and the glen was filled\nwith sunlight, though as yet there seemed no sun. Behind a peak of hill\nit displayed its chastened morning splendours, but a stray affluence of\nbrightness had sought the nooks of valley in all the wide uplands,\ncourier of the great lord of heat and light and the brown summer. The\nhouse of Etterick stands high in a crinkle of hill, with a background of\ndark pines, and in front a lake, set in shores of rock and heather.\nWhen the world grew bright Lewis awoke, for that strange young man had a\ntrick of rising early, and as he rubbed sleep from his eyes at the\nwindow he saw the exceeding goodliness of the morning. He roused his\ncompanions with awful threats, and then wandered along a corridor till\nhe came to a low verandah, whence a little pier ran into a sheltered bay\nof the loch. This was his morning bathing-place, and as he ran down the\nsurface of rough moorland stone he heard steps behind him, and George\nplunged into the cold blue waters scarcely a second after his host.\n\nIt was as chill as winter save for the brightness of the morning, which\nmade the loch in open spaces a shining gold. As they raced each other\nto the far end, now in the dark blue of shade, now in the gold of the\nopen, the hill breeze fanned their hair, and the great woody smell of\npines was sweet around them. The house stood dark and silent, for the\nside before them was the men's quarters, and at that season given up to\nthemselves; but away beyond, the smoke of chimneys curled into the still\nair. A man was mowing in some field on the hillside, and the cry of\nsheep came from the valley. By and by they reached the shelving coast\nof fine hill gravel, and as they turned to swim easily back a sleepy\nfigure staggered down the pier and stumbled rather than plunged into the\nwater.\n\n\"Hullo!\" gasped George, \"there's old John. He'll drown, for I bet you\nanything he isn't awake. Look!\"\n\nBut in a second a dark head appeared which shook itself vigorously, and\na figure made for the other two with great strokes. He was by so much\nthe best swimmer of the three that he had soon reached them, and though\nin all honesty he first swam to the farther shore, yet he touched the\npier very little behind them. Then came a rush for the house, and in\nhalf an hour three fresh-coloured young men came downstairs, whistling\nfor breakfast.\n\nThe breakfast-room was a place to refresh a townsman's senses. Long and\ncool and dark, it was simply Lewis's room, and he preferred to entertain\nhis friends there instead of wandering among unused dining-rooms. It\nhad windows at each end with old-fashioned folding sashes; and the view\non one side was to a great hill shoulder, fir-clad and deep in heather,\nand on the other to the glen below and the shining links of the Avelin.\nIt was panelled in dark oak, and the furniture was a strange medley.\nThe deep arm-chairs by the fire and the many pipes savoured of the\nsmoking-room; the guns, rods, polo sticks, whips, which were stacked or\nhung everywhere, and the heads of deer on the walls, gave it an\natmosphere of sport. The pictures were few but good--two water-colours,\na small Raeburn above the fireplace, and half a dozen fine etchings. In\na corner were many old school and college groups--the Eton Ramblers, the\nO.U.A.C., some dining clubs, and one of Lewis on horseback in racing\ncostume, looking deeply miserable. Low bookcases of black oak ran round\nthe walls, and the shelves were crammed with books piled on one another,\nmany in white vellum bindings, which showed pleasantly against the dark\nwood. Flowers were everywhere--common garden flowers of old-fashioned\nkinds, for the owner hated exotics, and in a shallow silver bowl in the\nmidst of the snowy table-cloth was a great mass of purple heather-bells.\n\nThree very hungry young men sat down to their morning meal with a hearty\ngoodwill. The host began to rummage among his correspondence, and\nfinally extracted an unstamped note, which he opened. His face\nbrightened as he read, and he laid it down with a broad smile and helped\nhimself to fish.\n\n\"Are you people very particular what you do to-day?\" he asked.\n\nArthur said, No. George explained that he was in the hands of his\nbeneficent friend.\n\n\"Because my Aunt Egeria down at Glenavelin has got up some sort of a\npicnic on the moors, and she wants us to meet her at the sheepfolds\nabout twelve.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said George meditatively. \"Excellent! I shall be charmed.\" But\nhe looked significantly at Arthur, who returned the glance.\n\n\"Who are at Glenavelin?\" asked that simple young man with an air of\ninnocence.\n\n\"There's a man called Stocks, whom you probably know.\"\n\nArthur nodded.\n\n\"And there's Bertha Afflint and her sister.\"\n\nIt was George's turn to nod approvingly. The sharp-witted Miss Afflint\nwas a great ally of his.\n\n\"And there's a Miss Wishart--Alice Wishart,\" said Lewis, without a word\nof comment. \"And with my Aunt Egeria that will be all.\"\n\nThe pair got the cue, and resolved to subject the Miss Wishart whose\nname came last on their host's tongue to a friendly criticism.\nMeanwhile they held their peace on the matter like wise men.\n\n\"What a strange name Egeria is!\" said Arthur. \"Very,\" said Lewis; \"but\nyou know the story. My respectable aunt's father had a large family of\ngirls, and being of a classical turn of mind he called them after the\nMuses. The Muses held out for nine, but for the tenth and youngest he\nfound himself in a difficulty. So he tried another tack and called the\nchild after the nymph Egeria. It sounds outlandish, but I prefer it to\nTerpsichore.\"\n\nThereafter they lit pipes, and, with the gravity which is due to a great\nsubject, inspected their friend's rods and guns.\n\n\"I see no memorials of your travels, Lewie,\" said Arthur. \"You must\nhave brought back no end of things, and most people like to stick them\nround as a remembrance.\"\n\n\"I have got a roomful if you want to see them,\" said the traveller; \"but\nI don't see the point of spoiling a moorland place with foreign odds and\nends. I like homely and native things about me when I am in Scotland.\"\n\n\"You're a sentimentalist, old man,\" said his friend; and George, who\nheard only the last word, assumed that Arthur had then and there\ndivulged his suspicions, and favoured that gentleman with a wild frown\nof disapproval.\n\nAs Lewis sat on the edge of the Etterick burn and looked over the\nshining spaces of morning, forgetful of his friends, forgetful of his\npast, his mind was full of a new turmoil of feeling. Alice Wishart had\nbegun to claim a surprising portion of his thoughts. He told himself a\nthousand times that he was not in love--that he should never be in love,\nbeing destined for other things; that he liked the girl as he liked any\nfresh young creature in the morning of life, with youth's beauty and the\ngrace of innocence. But insensibly his everyday reflections began to be\ncoloured by her presence. \"What would she think of this?\" \"How that\nwould please her!\" were sentences spoken often by the tongue of his\nfancy. He found charm in her presence after his bachelor solitude; her\ndemure gravity pleased him; but that he should be led bond-slave by\nlove--that was a matter he valiantly denied.\n\n\nII\n\nThe sheepfolds of Etterick lie in a little fold of glen some two miles\nfrom the dwelling, where the heathy tableland, known all over the glen\nas \"The Muirs,\" relieves the monotony of precipitous hills. On this day\nit was alert with life. The little paddock was crammed with sheep, and\nmore stood huddling in the pens. Within was the liveliest scene, for\nthere a dozen herds sat on clipping-stools each with a struggling ewe\nbetween his knees, and the ground beneath him strewn with creamy folds\nof fleece. From a thing like a gallows in a corner huge bags were\nsuspended which were slowly filling. A cauldron of pitch bubbled over a\nfire, and the smoke rose blue in the hot hill air. Every minute a\nbashful animal was led to be branded with a great E on the left shoulder\nand then with awkward stumbling let loose to join her naked\nfellow-sufferers. Dogs slept in the sun and wagged their tails in the\nrear of the paddock. Small children sat on gates and lent willing feet\nto drive the flocks. In a corner below a little shed was the clippers'\nmeal of ale and pies, with two glasses of whisky each, laid by under a\nwhite cloth. Meantime from all sides rose the continual crying of\nsheep, the intermittent bark of dogs, and the loud broad converse of the\nmen.\n\nLewis and his friends jumped a fence, and were greeted heartily in the\nenclosure. He seemed to know each herd by name or rather nickname, for\nhe had a word for all, and they with all freedom grinned _badinage_ back.\n\n\"Where's my stool, Yed?\" he cried. \"Am I not to have a hand in clipping\nmy own sheep?\"\n\nAn obedient shepherd rose and fetched one of the triangular seats, while\nLewis with great ease caught the ewe, pulled her on her back, and\nproceeded to call for shears. An old pair was found for him, and with\nmuch dexterity he performed the clipping, taking little longer to the\nbusiness than the expert herd, and giving the shears a professional wipe\non the sacking with which he had prudently defended his clothes.\n\nFrom somewhere in the back two boys came forward--the Tam and Jock of a\nformer day--eager to claim acquaintance. Jock was clearly busy, for his\njacket was off and a very ragged shirt was rolled about two stout brown\narms. The \"human collie\" seemed to be a gentleman of some leisure, for\nhe was arrayed in what was for him the pink of fashion in dress. The\ntwo immediately lay down on the ground beside Lewis exactly in the\nmanner of faithful dogs.\n\nThe men talked cheerfully, mainly on sheep and prices. Now talk would\ntouch on neighbours, and there would be the repetition of some tale or\nsaying. \"There was a man in the glen called Rorison. D'ye mind Jock\nRorison, Sandy?\" And Sandy would reply, \"Fine I mind Jock,\" and then\nboth would proceed to confidences.\n\n\"Hullo, Tam,\" said Lewis at last, realizing his henchman's grandeur. \"Why\nthis magnificence of dress?\n\n\"I'm gaun to the Sabbath-school treat this afternoon,\" said that worthy.\n\n\"And you, Jock-are you going too?\"\n\n\"No me! I'm ower auld, and besides, I've cast out wi' the minister.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"Oh, I had been fechtin',\" said Jock airily. \"It was Andra Laidlaw. He\ncalled me ill names, so I yokit on him and bate him too, but I got my\nface gey sair bashed. The minister met me next day when I was a' blue\nand yellow, and, says he, 'John Laverlaw, what have ye been daein'?\nYe're a bonny sicht for Christian een. How do ye think a face like\nyours will look between a pair o' wings in the next warld?' I ken I'm no\nbonny,\" added the explanatory Jock; \"but ye canna expect a man to thole\nsiccan language as that.\"\n\nLewis laughed and, being engaged in clipping his third sheep, forgot the\ndelicacy of his task and let the shears slip. A very ugly little cut on\nthe animal's neck was the result.\n\n\"Oh, confound it!\" cried the penitent amateur. \"Look what I've done,\nYed. I'll have to rub in some of that stuff of yours and sew on a\nbandage. The files will kill the poor thing if we leave the cut bare in\nthis infernal heat.\"\n\nThe old shepherd nodded, and pointed to where the remedies were kept.\nJock went for the box, which contained, besides the ointment, some rolls\nof stout linen and a huge needle and twine. Lewis doctored the wound as\nbest he could, and then proceeded to lay on the cloth and sew it to the\nfleece. The ewe grew restless with the heat and the pinching of the\ncut, and Jock was given the task of holding her head.\n\nClearly Lewis was not meant by Providence for a tailor. He made\nlamentable work with the needle. It slipped and pricked his fingers,\nwhile his unfeeling friends jeered and Tam turned great eyes of sympathy\nupwards from his Sunday garments.\n\n\"Patience, patience, man!\" said the old herd. \"Ca' cannier and be a wee\nthing quieter in your langwidge. There's a wheen leddies comin' up the\nburn.\"\n\nIt was too late. Before Lewis understood the purport of the speech Lady\nManorwater and her party were at the folds, and as he made one final\neffort with the refractory needle a voice in his ear said:\n\n\"Please let me do that, Mr. Haystoun. I've often done it before.\"\n\nHe looked up and met Alice Wishart's laughing eyes. She stood beside\nhim and deftly finished the bandage till the ewe was turned off the\nstool. Then, very warm and red, he turned to find a cool figure\nlaughing at his condition.\n\n\"I'll have to go and wash my hands, Miss Wishart,\" he said gravely.\n\"You had better come too.\" And the pair ran down to a deep brown pool in\nthe burn and cleansed from their fingers the subtle aroma of fleeces.\n\n\"Ugh! my clothes smell like a drover's. That's the worst of being a\ndabbler in most trades. You can never resist the temptation to try your\nhand.\"\n\n\"But, really, your whole manner was most professional, Mr. Haystoun.\nYour language--\"\n\n\"Please, don't,\" said the penitent; and they returned to the others to\nfind that once cheerful assembly under a cloud. Every several man there\nwas nervously afraid of women and worked feverishly as if under some\ngreat Taskmistress's eye. The result was a superfluity of shear-marks\nand deep, muffled profanity. Lady Manorwater ran here and there asking\nquestions and confusing the workers; while Mr. Stocks, in pursuance of\nhis democratic sentiments, talked in a stilted fashion to the nearest\nclipper, who called him \"Sir\" and seemed vastly ill at ease.\n\nLewis restored some cordiality. Under her nephew's influence Lady\nManorwater became natural and pleasing. Jock was ferreted out of some\ncorner and, together with the reluctant Tam, brought up for\npresentation.\n\n\"Tam,\" said his patron, \"I'll give you your choice. Whether will you go\nto the Sabbath-school treat, or come with us to a real picnic? Jock is\ncoming, and I promise you better fun and better things to eat.\"\n\nIt was no case for hesitation. Tam executed a doglike gambol on the\nturf, and proceeded to course up the burn ahead of the party, a vision\nof twinkling bare legs and ill-fitting Sunday clothes. The sedate Jock\nrolled down his sleeves, rescued a ragged jacket, and stalked in the\nrear.\n\n\nIII\n\nOnce on the heathy plateau the party scattered. Mr. Stocks caught the\nunwilling Arthur and treated him to a disquisition on the\ncharacteristics of the people whose votes he was soon to solicit. As\nhis acquaintance with the subject was not phenomenal, the profit to the\naggrieved listener was small. George, Lady Manorwater, and the two Miss\nAfflints sought diligently for a camping-ground, which they finally\nfound by a clear spring of water on the skirts of a great grey rock.\nMeanwhile, Alice Wishart and Lewis, having an inordinate love of high\nplaces, set out for the ridge summit, and reached it to find a wind\nblowing from the far Gled valley and cooling the hot air.\n\nAlice found a scrap of rock and climbed to the summit, where she sat\nlike a small pixie, surveying a wide landscape and her warm and\nprostrate companion. Her bright hair and eyes and her entrancing grace\nof form made the callous Lewis steal many glances upwards from his lowly\nseat. The two had become excellent friends, for the man had that honest\nsimplicity towards women which is the worst basis for love and the best\nfor friendship. She felt that at any moment he might call her by some\none or other of the endearing expressions used between men. He, for his\npart, was fast drifting from friendship to another feeling, but as yet\nhe gave no sign of it, and kept up the brusque, kindly manners of his\ncommon life.\n\nAs she looked east and north to the heart of the hill-land, her eyes\nbrightened, and she rose up and strained on tiptoe to scan the farthest\nhorizon. Eagerly she asked the name of this giant and that, of this\nglint of water--was it loch or burn? Lewis answered without hesitation,\nas one to whom the country was as well known as his own name.\n\nBy and by her curiosity was satisfied and she slipped back into her old\nposture, and with chin on hand gazed into the remote distances. \"And\nmost of that is yours? Do you know, if I had a land like this I should\nnever leave it again. You, in your ingratitude, will go wandering away\nin a year or two, as if any place on earth could be better than this.\nYou are simply 'sinning away your mercies,' as my grandfather used to\nsay.\"\n\n\"But what would become of the heroic virtues that you adore?\" asked the\ncynical Lewis. \"If men were all home-keepers it would be a prosaic\nworld.\"\n\n\"Can you talk of the prosaic and Etterick in the same breath? Besides,\nit is the old fallacy of man that the domestic excludes the heroic,\"\nsaid Alice, fighting for the privileges of her sex.\n\n\"But then, you know, there comes a thing they call the go-fever, which\nis not amenable to reason. People who have it badly do not care a straw\nfor a place in itself; all they want is to be eternally moving from one\nspot to another.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not a sufferer yet, but I walk in fear, for at any moment it\nmay beset me.\" And, laughing, he climbed up beside her.\n\nIt may be true that the last subject of which a man tires is himself,\nbut Lewis Haystoun in this matter must have been distinct from the\ncommon run of men. Alice had given him excellent opportunities for\negotism, but the blind young man had not taken them. The girl, having\nbeen brought up to a very simple and natural conception of talk, thought\nno more about it, except that she would have liked so great a traveller\nto speak more generously. No doubt, after all, this reticence was\npreferable to self-revelation. Mr. Stocks had been her companion that\nmorning in the drive to Etterick, and he had entertained her with a\nsketch of his future. He had declined, somewhat nervously, to talk of\nhis early life, though the girl, with her innate love of a fighter,\nwould have listened with pleasure. But he had sketched his political\ncreed, hinted at the puissance of his friends, claimed a monopoly of the\npurer sentiments of life, and rosily augured the future. The girl had\nbeen silent--the man had thought her deeply impressed; but now the\nmorning's talk seemed to point a contrast, and Mr. Lewis Haystoun\nclimbed to a higher niche in the temple of her esteem.\n\nAfar off the others were signaling that lunch was ready, but the two on\nthe rock were blind.\n\n\"I think you are right to go away,\" said Alice. \"You would be too well\noff here. One would become a very idle sort of being almost at once.\"\n\n\"And I am glad you agree with me, Miss Wishart. 'Here is the shore, and\nthe far wide world's before me,' as the song says. There is little\ndoing in these uplands, but there's a vast deal astir up and down the\nearth, and it would be a pity not to have a hand in it.\"\n\nThen he stopped suddenly, for at that moment the light and colour went\nout of his picture of the wanderer's life, and he saw instead a homelier\nscene--a dainty figure moving about the house, sitting at his table's\nhead, growing old with him in the fellowship of years. For a moment he\nfelt the charm of the red hearth and the quiet life. Some such sketch\nmust the Goddess of Home have drawn for Ulysses or the wandering Olaf,\nand if Swanhild or the true Penelope were as pretty as this lady of the\nrock there was credit in the renunciation. The man forgot the wide\nworld and thought only of the pin-point of Glenavelin.\n\nSome such fancy too may have crossed the girl's mind. At any rate she\ncast one glance at the abstracted Lewis and welcomed a courier from the\nrest of the party. This was no other than the dandified Tam, who had\nbeen sent post-haste by George--that true friend having suffered the\nagonies of starvation and a terrible suspicion as to what rash step his\nhost might be taking. Plainly the young man had not yet made Miss\nWishart's acquaintance.\n\n\nIV\n\nThe sun set in the thick of the dark hills, and a tired and merry party\nscrambled down the burnside to the highway. They had long outstayed\ntheir intention, but care sat lightly there, and Lady Manorwater alone\nwas vexed by thoughts of a dinner untouched and a respectable household\nin confusion. The sweet-scented dusk was soothing to the senses, and\nthere in the narrow glen, with the wide blue strath and the gleam of the\nriver below, it was hard to find the link of reality and easy to credit\nfairyland. Arthur and Miss Wishart had gone on in front and were now\nstrayed among boulders. She liked this trim and precise young man,\nwhose courtesy was so grave and elaborate, while he, being a recluse by\nnature but a humanitarian by profession, was half nervous and half\nentranced in her cheerful society. They talked of nothing, their hearts\nbeing set on the scramble, and when at last they reached the highway and\nthe farm where the Glenavelin traps had been put up, they found\nthemselves a clear ten minutes in advance of the others.\n\nAs they sat on the dyke in the soft cool air Alice spoke casually of the\nplace. \"Where is Etterick?\" she asked; and a light on a hillside\nfarther up the glen was pointed out to her.\n\n\"It's a very fresh and pleasant place to stay at,\" said Arthur. \"We're\nmuch higher than you are at Glenavelin, and the house is bigger and\nolder. But we simply camp in a corner of it. You can never get Lewie\nto live like other people. He is the best of men, but his tastes are\nprimeval. He makes us plunge off a verandah into a loch first thing in\nthe morning, you know, and I shall certainly drown some day, for I am\nnever more than half awake, and I always seem to go straight to the\nbottom. Then he is crazy about long expeditions, and when the Twelfth\ncomes we shall never be off the hill. He is a long way too active for\nthese slack modern days.\"\n\nLewie, Lewie! It was Lewie everywhere! thought the girl. What could\nbecome of a man who was so hedged about by admirers? He had seemed to\ncourt her presence, and her heart had begun to beat faster of late when\nshe saw his face. She dared not confess to herself that she was in\nlove--that she wanted this Lewis to herself, and bated the pretensions of\nhis friends. Instead she flattered herself with a fiction. Her ground\nwas the high one of an interest in character. She liked the young man\nand was sorry to see him in a way to be spoiled by too much admiration.\nAnd the angel who records our innermost thoughts smiled to himself, if\nsuch grave beings can smile.\n\nMeantime Lewis was delivered bound and captive to the enemy. All down\nthe burn his companion had been Mr. Stocks, and they had lagged behind\nthe others. That gentleman had not enjoyed the day; he had been bored\nby the landscape and scorched by the sun; also, as the time of contest\napproached, he was full of political talk, and he had found no ears to\nappreciate it. Now he had seized on Lewis, and the younger man had lent\nhim polite attention though inwardly full of ravening and bitterness.\n\n\"Your friend Mr. Mordaunt has promised to support my candidature. You,\nof course, will be in the opposite camp.\"\n\nLewis said he did not think so--that he had lost interest in party\npolitics, and would lie low.\n\nMr. Stocks bowed in acquiescence.\n\n\"And what do you think of my chances?\"\n\nLewis replied that he should think about equal betting. \"You see the\nplace is Radical in the main, with the mills at Gledfoot and the weavers\nat Gledsmuir. Up in Glenavelin they are more or less Conservative.\nMerkland gets in usually by a small majority because he is a local man\nand has a good deal of property down the Gled. If two strangers fought\nit the Radical would win; as it is it is pretty much of a toss-up either\nway.\"\n\n\"But if Sir Robert resigns?\"\n\n\"Oh, that scare has been raised every time by the other party. I should\nsay that there's no doubt that the old man will keep on for years.\"\n\nMr. Stocks looked relieved. \"I heard of his resignation as a\ncertainty, and I was afraid that a stronger man might take his place.\"\n\nSo it fell out that the day which began with pastoral closed, like many\nanother day, with politics. Since Lewis refrained from controversy, Mr.\nStocks seemed to look upon him as a Gallio from whom no danger need be\nfeared, nay, even as a convert to be fostered. He became confident and\ntalked jocularly of the tricks of his trade. Lewis's boredom was\ncomplete by the time they reached the farmhouse and found the Glenavelin\nparty ready to start.\n\n\"We want to see Etterick, so we shall come to lunch to-morrow, Lewie,\"\nsaid his aunt. \"So be prepared, my dear, and be on your best\nbehaviour.\"\n\nThen, with his two friends, he turned towards the lights of his home.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHE MAKERS OF EMPIRE\n\n\nThe day before the events just recorded two men had entered the door of\na certain London club and made their way to a remote little smoking-room\non the first floor. It was not a handsome building, nor had it any\nparticular outlook or position. It was a small, old-fashioned place in\na side street, in style obviously of last century, and the fittings\nwithin were far from magnificent. Yet no club carried more distinction\nin its membership. Its hundred possible inmates were the cream of the\nhigher professions, the chef and the cellar were things to wonder at,\nand the man who could write himself a member of the Rota Club had\nobtained one of the rare social honours which men confer on one another.\nThither came all manner of people--the distinguished foreigner travelling\nincognito, and eager to talk with some Minister unofficially on matters\nof import, the diplomat on a secret errand, the traveller home for a\nbrief season, the soldier, the thinker, the lawyer. It was a catholic\nassembly, but exclusive--very. Each man bore the stamp of competence on\nhis face, and there was no cheap talk of the \"well-informed\" variety.\nWhen the members spoke seriously they spoke like experts; otherwise they\nwere apt to joke very much like schoolboys let loose. The Right Hon.\nMr. M---- was not above twitting Lord S---- with gunroom stories, and\nsuffering in turn good-natured libel.\n\nOf the two men lighting their pipes in the little room one was to the\nfirst glance a remarkable figure. About the middle height, with a\nsquare head and magnificent shoulders, he looked from the back not\nunlike some professional strong man. But his face betrayed him, for it\nwas clearly the face of the intellectual worker, the man of character\nand mind. His jaw was massive and broad, saved from hardness only by a\nquaintly humorous mouth; he had, too, a pair of very sharp blue eyes\nlooking from under shaggy eyebrows. His age was scarcely beyond thirty,\nbut one would have put it ten years later, for there were lines on his\nbrow and threads of grey in his hair. His companion was slim and, to a\nhasty glance, insignificant. He wore a peaked grey beard which\nlengthened his long, thin face, and he had a nervous trick of drumming\nalways with his fingers on whatever piece of furniture was near. But if\nyou looked closer and marked the high brow, the keen eyes, and the very\nresolute mouth, the thought of insignificance disappeared. He looked\nnot unlike a fighting Yankee colonel who had had a Puritan upbringing,\nand the impression was aided by his simplicity in dress. He was, in\nfact, a very great man, the Foreign Secretary of the time, formerly\nknown to fame as Lord Malham, and at the moment, by his father's death,\nLord Beauregard, and, for his sins, an exile to the Upper House. His\ncompanion, whose name was Wratislaw, was a younger Member of Parliament\nwho was credited with peculiar knowledge and insight on the matters\nwhich formed his lordship's province. They were close friends and\nallies of some years' standing, and colloquies between the two in this\nvery place were not unknown to the club annals.\n\nLord Beauregard looked at his companion's anxious face. \"Do you know\nthe news?\" he said.\n\n\"What news?\" asked Wratislaw. \"That your family position is changed, or\nthat the dissolution will be a week earlier, or that Marka is busy\nagain?\"\n\n\"I mean the last. How did you know? Did you see the telegrams?\"\n\n\"No, I saw it in the papers.\"\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" said the great man. \"Let me see the thing,\" and he\nsnatched a newspaper cutting from Wratislaw's hand, returning it the\nnext moment with a laugh. It ran thus: \"Telegrams from the Punjab\ndeclare that an expedition, the personnel of which is not yet revealed,\nis about to start for the town of Bardur in N. Kashmir, to penetrate the\nwastes beyond the frontier. It is rumoured that the expedition has a\nsemi-official character.\"\n\n\"That's our friend,\" said Wratislaw, putting the paper into his pocket.\n\nLord Beauregard wrinkled his brow and stared at the bowl of his pipe.\n\"I see the motive clearly, but I am hanged if I understand why an\nevening paper should print it. Who in this country knows of the\nexistence of Bardur?\"\n\n\"Many people since Haystoun's book,\" said the other.\n\n\"I have just glanced at it. Is there anything important in it?\"\n\n\"Nothing that we did not know before. But things are put in a fresh\nlight. He covered ground himself of which we had only a second-hand\naccount.\"\n\n\"And he talks of this Bardur?\"\n\n\"A good deal. He is an expert in his way on the matter and uncommonly\nclever. He kept the best things out of the book, and it would be worth\nyour while meeting him. Do you happen to know him?\"\n\n\"No--o,\" said the great man doubtfully. \"Oh, stop a moment. I have\nheard my young brother talk of somebody of the same name. Rather a\nfigure at Oxford, wasn't he?\"\n\nWratislaw nodded. \"But to talk of Marka,\" he added.\n\n\"His mission is, of course, official, and he has abundant resources.\"\n\n\"So much I gathered,\" said Wratislaw. \"But his designs?\n\n\"He knows the tribes in the North better than any living man, but\nwithout a base at hand he is comparatively harmless. The devil in the\nthing is that we do not know how close that base may be. Fifty thousand\nmen may be massed within fifty miles, and we are in ignorance.\"\n\n\"It is the lack of a secret service,\" said the other. \"Had we that,\nthere are a hundred young men who would have risked their necks there\nand kept us abreast of our enemies. As it is, we have to wait till news\ncomes by some roundabout channel, while that cheerful being, Marka,\nkeeps the public easy by news of hypothetical private expeditious.\"\n\n\"And meantime there is that thousand-mile piece of desert of which we\nknow nothing, and where our friends may be playing pranks as they\nplease. Well, well, we must wait on developments. It is the last\nrefuge of the ill-informed. What about the dissolution? You are safe,\nI suppose?\"\n\nWratislaw nodded.\n\n\"I have been asked my forecast fifty times to-day, and I steadily refuse\nto speak. But I may as well give it to you. We shall come back with a\nmajority of from fifty to eighty, and you, my dear fellow, will not be\nforgotten.\"\n\n\"You mean the Under-Secretaryship,\" said the other. \"Well, I don't mind\nit.\"\n\n\"I should think not. Why, you will get that chance your friends have\nhoped so long for, and then it is only a matter of time till you climb\nthe last steps. You are a youngish man for a Minister, for all your\nelderly manners.\"\n\nWratislaw smiled the pleased smile of the man who hears kind words from\none whom he admires. \"It won't be a bed of roses, you know. I am very\nunpopular, and I have the grace to know it.\"\n\nThe elder man looked on the younger with an air of kindly wisdom. \"Your\npride may have a fall, my dear fellow. You are young and confident, I\nam old and humble. Some day you will be glad to hope that you are not\nwithout this despised popularity.\"\n\nWratislaw looked grave. \"God forbid that I should despise it. When it\ncomes my way I shall think that my work is done, and rest in peace. But\nyou and I are not the sort of people who can court it with comfort. We\nare old sticks and very full of angles, but it would be a pity to rub\nthem off if the shape were to be spoiled.\"\n\nLord Beauregard nodded. \"Tell me more about your friend Haystoun.\"\n\nWratislaw's face relaxed, and he became communicative.\n\n\"He is a Scots laird, rather well off, and, as I have said, uncommonly\nclever. He lives at a place called Etterick in the Gled valley.\"\n\n\"I saw Merkland to-day, and he spoke his farewell to politics. The\nWhips told me about it yesterday.\"\n\n\"Merkland! But he always raised that scare!\"\n\n\"He is serious this time. He has sold his town house.\"\n\n\"Then that settles it. Lewis shall stand in his place.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the great man. \"We want experts. He would strengthen your\nfeeble hands and confirm your tottering knees, Tommy.\"\n\n\"If he gets in; but he will have a fight for it. Our dear friend Albert\nStocks has been nursing the seat, and the Manorwaters and scores of\nLewie's friends will help him. That young man has a knack of confining\nhis affections to members of the opposite party.\"\n\n\"What was Merkland's majority? Two-fifty or something like that?\"\n\n\"There or about. But he was an old and well-liked country laird,\nwhereas Lewie is a very young gentleman with nothing to his credit\nexcept an Oxford reputation and a book of travels, neither of which will\nappeal to the Gledsmuir weavers.\"\n\n\"But he is popular?\"\n\n\"Where he is known--adored. But his name does not carry confidence to\nthose who do not know the man, for his family were weak-kneed gentry.\"\n\n\"Yes, I knew his father. Able, but crotchety and impossible! Tommy,\nthis young man must get the seat, for we cannot afford to throw away a\nsingle chance. You say he knows the place,\" and he jerked his head to\nindicate that East to which his thoughts were ever turning. \"Some time\nin the next two years there will be the devil's own mess in that happy\nland. Then your troubles will begin, my friend, and I can wish nothing\nbetter for you than the support of some man in the Commons who knows\nthat Bardur is not quite so pastoral as Hampshire. He may relieve you\nof some of the popular odium you are courting, and at the worst he can\nbe sent out.\"\n\nWratislaw whistled long and low. \"I think not,\" he said. \"He is too\ngood to throw away. But he must get in, and as there is nothing in the\nworld for me to do I shall go up to Etterick tomorrow and talk to him.\nHe will do as I tell him, and we can put our back into the fight.\nBesides, I want to see Stocks again. That man is the joy of my heart!\"\n\n\"Lucky beggar!\" said the Minister. \"Oh, go by all means and enjoy\nyourself, while I swelter here for another three weeks over meaningless\ntelegrams enlivened by the idiot diplomatist. Good-bye and good luck,\nand bring the young man to a sense of his own value.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nMR. WRATISLAW'S ADVENT\n\n\nAs the three men went home in the dusk they talked of the day. Lewis\nhad been in a bad humour, but the company of his friends exorcised the\nimp of irritation, and he felt only the mellow gloom of the evening and\nthe sweet scents of the moor. In such weather he had a trick of walking\nwith his head high and his nostrils wide, sniffing the air like the wild\nass of the desert with which the metaphorical George had erstwhile\ncompared him. That young man meanwhile was occupied with his own\nreflections. His good nature had been victimized, he had been made to\nfetch and carry continually, and the result was that he had scarcely\nspoken a word to Miss Wishart. His plans thus early foiled, nothing\nremained but to draw the more fortunate Arthur, so in a conspirator's\naside he asked him his verdict. But Arthur refused to speak. \"She is\npretty and clever,\" he said, \"and excellent company.\" And with this his\nlips were sealed, and his thoughts went off on his own concerns.\n\nLewis heard and smiled. The sun and wind of the hills beat in his\npulses like wine. To have breathed all day the fragrance of heather and\npines, to have gladdened the eye with an infinite distance and blue\nlines of mountain, was with this man to have drunk the cup of\nintoxicating youth. The cool gloaming did not chill; rather it was the\nhigh and solemn aftermath of the day's harvesting. The faces of\ngracious women seemed blent with the pageant of summer weather; kindly\nvoices, simple joys--for a moment they seemed to him the major matters in\nlife. So far it was pleasing fancy, but Alice soon entered to disturb\nwith the disquieting glory of her hair. The family of the Haystouns had\never a knack of fine sentiment. Fantastic, unpractical, they were\ngluttons for the romantic, the recondite, and the dainty. But now had\ncome a breath of strong wind which rent the meshes of a philandering\nfancy. A very new and strange feeling was beginning to make itself\nknown. He had come to think of Alice with the hot pained affection\nwhich makes the high mountains of the world sink for the time to a\nspecies of mole-hillock. She danced through his dreams and usurped all\nthe paths of his ambition. Formerly he had thought of himself--for the\nman was given to self-portraiture--as the adventurer, the scorner of the\ndomestic; now he struggled to regain the old attitude, but he struggled\nin vain. The ways were blocked, a slim figure was ever in view, and lo!\nwhen he blotted it from his sight the world was dark and the roads\nblind. For a moment he had lost his bearings on the sea of life. As\nyet the discomfiture was sweet, his confusion was a joy; and it is the\nfirst trace of weakness which we have seen in the man that he accepted\nthe unsatisfactory with composure.\n\nAt the door of Etterick it became apparent that something was astir.\nWheel-marks were clear in the gravel, and the ancient butler had an air\nof ceremony. \"Mr. Wratislaw has arrived, sir,\" he whispered to Lewis,\nwhereat that young man's face shone.\n\n\"When? How? Where is he now?\" he cried, and with a word to his\ncompanions he had crossed the hall, raced down a lengthy passage, and\nflung open the door of his sanctum. There, sure enough, were the broad\nshoulders of Wratislaw bending among the books.\n\n\"Lord bless me, Tommy, what extraordinary surprise visit is this? I\nthought you would be over your ears in work. We are tremendously\npleased to see you.\"\n\nThe sharp blue eyes had been scanning the other's frank sunburnt face\nwith an air of affectionate consideration. \"I got off somehow or other,\nas I had to see you, old man, so I thought I would try this place first.\nWhat a fortressed wilderness you live in! I got out at Gledsmuir after\ntravelling some dreary miles in a train which stopped at every farm, and\nthen I had to wait an hour till the solitary dogcart of the inn\nreturned. Hullo! you've got other visitors.\" And he stretched out a\nmassive hand to Arthur and George.\n\nThe sight of him had lifted a load from these gentlemen's hearts. The\nold watchdog had come; the little terriers might now take holiday. The\ntask of being Lewis's keeper did not by right belong to them; they were\nonly amateurs acting in the absence of the properly qualified Wratislaw.\nBesides, it had been anxious work, for while each had sworn to himself\naforetime to protect his friend from the wiles of Miss Wishart, both\nwere now devoted slaves drawn at that young woman's chariot wheel. You\nwill perceive that it is a delicate matter to wage war with a goddess,\nand a task unblest of Heaven.\n\nSupper was brought, and the lamps lit in the cool old room, where,\nthrough the open window, they could still catch the glint of foam on the\nstream and the dark gloom of pines on the hill. They fell ravenously on\nthe meal, for one man had eaten nothing since midday and the others were\nfresh from moorland air. Thereafter they pulled armchairs to a window,\nand lit the pipes of contentment. Wratislaw stretched his arms on the\nsill and looked out into the fragrant darkness.\n\n\"Any news, Tommy?\" asked his host. \"Things seem lively in the East.\"\n\n\"Very, but I am ill-informed. Did you lay no private lines of\ncommunication in your travels?\"\n\n\"They were too short. I picked up a lot of out-of-the-way hints, but as\nI am not a diplomatist I cannot use them. I think I have already made\nyou a present of most. By the by, I see from the papers that an\nofficial expedition is going north from Bardur. What idiot invented\nthat?\"\n\nWratislaw pulled his head in and sat back in his chair. \"You are sure\nyou don't happen to know?\"\n\n\"Sure. But it is just the sort of canard which the gentry on the other\nside of the frontier would invent to keep things quiet. Who are the\nEnglishmen at Bardur now?\"\n\nThe elder man looked shrewdly at the younger, who was carelessly pulling\na flower to pieces. \"There's Logan, whom you know, and Thwaite and\nGribton.\"\n\n\"Good men all, but slow in the uptake. Logan is a jewel. He gave me\nthe best three days' shooting I ever dreamed of, and he has more stories\nin his head than George. But if matters got into a tangle I would\nrather not be in his company. Thwaite is a gentlemanlike sort of\nfellow, but dull--very, while Gribton is the ordinary shrewd commercial\nman, very cautious and rather timid.\"\n\n\"Did you ever happen to hear of a man called Marka? He might call\nhimself Constantine Marka, or Arthur Marker, or the Baron Mark--whatever\nhappened to suit him.\"\n\nLewis puzzled for a little. \"Yes, of course I did. By George! I\nshould think so. It was a chap of that name who had gone north the week\nbefore I arrived. They said he would never be heard of again. He\nseemed a reckless sort of fool.\"\n\n\"You didn't see him?\"\n\n\"No. But why?\"\n\n\"Simply that you came within a week of meeting one of the cleverest men\nliving, a cheerful being whom the Foreign Office is more interested in\nthan any one else in the world. If you should hear again of Constantine\nMarka, Marker, or Mark, please note it down.\"\n\n\"You mean that he is the author of the _canard_,\" said Lewis, with sharp\neyes, taking up a newspaper.\n\n\"Yes, and many more. This graceful person will complicate things for\nme, for I am to represent the Office in the Commons if we get back with\na decent majority.\"\n\nLewis held out a cordial hand. \"I congratulate you, Tommy. Now\nbeginneth the end, and may I be spared to see!\"\n\n\"I hope you may, and it's on this I want to talk to you. Merkland has\nresigned; it will be in the papers to-morrow. I got it kept out till I\ncould see you!\"\n\n\"Yes?\" said Lewis, with quickening interest.\n\n\"And we want you to take his place. I spoke to him, and he is\nenthusiastic on the matter. I wired to the Conservative Club at\nGledsmuir, and it seems you are their most cherished possibility. The\nleaders of the party are more than willing, so it only remains for you\nto consent, my dear boy.\"\n\n\"I--don't--think--I--can,\" said the possibility slowly. \"You see, only\nto-day I told that man Stocks that Merkland would not resign, and that I\nwas sick of party politics and would not interfere with his chances.\nThe poor beggar is desperately keen, and if I stood now he would think\nme disingenuous.\"\n\n\"But there is no reason why he should not know the truth. You can tell\nhim that you only heard about Merkland to-night, and that you act only\nin deference to strong external pressure.\"\n\n\"In that case he would think me a fool. I have a bad enough reputation\nfor lack of seriousness in these matters already. The man is not very\nparticular, and there is nothing to hinder him from blazoning it up and\ndown the place that I changed my mind in ten minutes on a friend's\nrecommendation. I should get a very complete licking.\"\n\n\"Do you mind, Lewie, if I advise you to take it seriously? It is really\nnot a case for little scruples about reputation. There are rocks ahead\nof me, and I want a man like you in the House more than I could make you\nunderstand. You say you hate party politics, and I am with you, but\nthere is no reason why you should not use them as a crutch to better\nwork. You are in your way an expert, and that is what we will need\nabove all things in the next few years. Of course, if you feel yourself\nbound by a promise not to oppose Stocks, then I have nothing more to\nsay; but, unless the man is a lunatic, he will admit the justice of your\ncase.\"\n\n\"You mean that you really want me, Tommy?\" said the young man, in great\ndoubt. \"I hate the idea of fighting Stocks, and I shall most certainly\nbe beaten.\"\n\n\"That is on the knees of the gods, and as for the rest I take the\nresponsibility. I shall speak to Stocks myself. It will be a sharp\nfight, but I see no reason why you should not win. After all, it is\nyour own countryside, and you are a better man than your opponent.\"\n\n\"You are the serpent who has broken up this peaceful home. I shall be\nmiserable for a month, and the house will be divided against itself.\nArthur has promised to help Stocks, while the Manorwaters, root and\nbranch, are pledged to support him.\"\n\n\"I'll do my best, Lewie, for old acquaintance' sake. It had to come\nsooner or later, you know, and it is as well that you should seize the\nfavourable moment. Now let us drop the subject for to-night. I want to\nenjoy myself.\"\n\nAnd he rose, stretched his great arms, and wandered about the room.\n\nTo all appearance he had forgotten the very existence of things\npolitical. Arthur, who had a contest to face shortly, was eager for\nadvice and the odds and ends of information which defend the joints in a\ncandidate's harness, but the well-informed man disdained to help. He\ntested the guns, gave his verdict on rods, and ranged through a cabinet\nof sporting requisites. Then he fell on his host's books, and for an\nhour the three were content to listen to him. It was rarely that\nWratislaw fell into such moods, but when the chance came it was not to\nbe lightly disregarded. A laborious youth had given him great stores of\nscholarship, and Lewis's books were a curious if chaotic collection. On\nthe fly-leaf of a little duodecimo was an inscription from the author of\nWaverley, who had often made Etterick his hunting-ground. A Dunbar had\nHawthornden's autograph, and a set of tall classic folios bore the\nhandwriting of George Buchanan. Lord Kames, Hume, and a score of others\nhad dedicated works to lairds of Etterick, and the Haystouns themselves\nhad deigned at times to court the Muse. Lewis's own special\nbooks--college prizes, a few modern authors, some well-thumbed poets, and\na row in half a dozen languages on some matters of diplomatic\ninterest--were crowded into a little oak bookcase which had once graced\nhis college rooms. Thither Wratislaw ultimately turned, dipping,\nbrowsing, reading a score of lines.\n\n\"What a nice taste you have in arrangement!\" he cried. \"Scott, Tolstoi,\nMeredith, an odd volume of a Saga library, an odd volume of the _Corpus\nBoreale_, some Irish reprints, Stevenson's poems, Virgil and the\n_Pilgrim's Progress_, and a French Gazetteer of Mountains wedged above\nthem. And then an odd Badminton volume, French _Memoires_, a Dante, a\nHomer, and a badly printed German text of Schopenhauer! Three different\ncopies of Rabelais, a De Thou, a Horace, and-bless my soul!--about\ntwenty books of fairy tales! Lewie, you must have a mind like a\nlumber-room.\"\n\n\"I pillaged books from the big library as I wanted them,\" said the young\nman humbly. \"Do you know, Tommy, to talk quite seriously, I get more\nerratic every day? Knocking about the world and living alone make me a\nqueer slave of whims. I am straying too far from the normal. I wish to\ngoodness you would take me and drive me back to the ways of common\nsense.\"\n\n\"Meaning--?\n\n\"That I am getting cranky and diffident. I am beginning to get nervous\nabout people's opinion and sensitive to my own eccentricity. It is a\nsad case for a man who never used to care a straw for a soul on earth.\"\n\n\"Lewie, attend to me,\" said Wratislaw, with mock gravity. \"You have not\nby any chance been falling in love?\"\n\nThe accused blushed like a girl, and lied withal like a trooper, to the\ndelight of the un-Christian George.\n\n\"Well, then, my dear fellow, there is hope for you yet. If a man once\ngets sentimental, he desires to be normal above all things, for he has a\ncrazy intuition that it is the normal which women really like, being\nthemselves but a hair's-breadth from the commonplace. I suppose it is\nonly another of the immortal errors with which mankind hedges itself\nabout.\"\n\n\"You think it an error?\" said Lewis, with such an air of relief that\nGeorge began to laugh and Wratislaw looked comically suspicious.\n\n\"Why the tone of joy, Lewie?\"\n\n\"I wanted your opinion,\" said the perjured young man. \"I thought of\nwriting a book. But that is not the thing I was talking about. I want\nto be normal, aggressively normal, to court the suffrages of Gledsmuir.\nDo you know Stocks?\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"An excellent person, but I never heard him utter a word above a child's\ncapacity. He can talk the most shrieking platitudes as if he had found\nat last the one and only truth. And people are impressed.\"\n\nWratislaw pulled down his eyebrows and proceeded to defend a Scottish\nconstituency against the libel of gullibility. But Lewis was not\nlistening. He did not think of the impression made on the voting\npowers, but on one small girl who clamorously impeded all his thoughts.\nShe was, he knew, an enthusiast for the finer sentiments of life, and of\nthese Mr. Stocks had long ago claimed a monopoly. He felt bitterly\njealous--the jealousy of the innocent man to whom woman is an\nunaccountable creature, whose habits and likings must be curiously\nstudied. He was dimly conscious of lacking the stage attributes of a\nlover. He could not pose as a mirror of all virtues, a fanatic for the\nTrue and the Good. Somehow or other he had acquired an air of\nself-seeking egotism, unscrupulousness, which he felt miserably must\nmake him unlovely in certain eyes. Nor would the contest he was\nentering upon improve this fancied reputation of his. He would have to\nsay hard, unfeeling things against what all the world would applaud as\ngenerous sentiment.\n\nWhen the others had gone yawning to bed, he returned and sat at the\nwindow for a little, smoking hard and puzzling out the knots which\nconfronted him. He had a dismal anticipation of failure. Not\ndefeat--that was a little matter; but an abject show of incompetence.\nHis feelings pulled him hither and thither. He could not utter moral\nplatitudes to checkmate his opponent's rhetoric, for, after all, he was\nhonest; nor could he fill the part of the cold critic of hazy sentiment;\ngladly though he would have done it, he feared the reproach in girlish\neyes. This good man was on the horns of a dilemma. Love and habit, a\ngenerous passion and a keen intellect dragged him alternately to their\nside, and as a second sign of weakness the unwilling scribe has to\nrecord that his conclusion as he went to bed was to let things drift--to\ntake his chance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nTHE EPISODES OF A DAY\n\n\nIt is painful to record it, but when the Glenavelin party arrived at\nnoon of the next day it was only to find the house deserted. Lady\nManorwater, accustomed to the vagaries of her nephew, led the guests\nover the place and found to her horror that it seemed undwelt in. The\nhall was in order, and the tart and rosy lairds of Etterick looked down\nfrom their Raeburn canvases on certain signs of habitation; but the\ndrawing-rooms were dingy with coverings and all the large rooms were in\nthe same tidy disarray. Then, wise from experience, she led the way to\nLewis's sanctum, and found there a pretty luncheon-table and every token\nof men's presence. Soon the four tenants arrived, hot and breathless,\nfrom the hill, to find Bertha Afflint deep in rods and guns, Miss\nWishart and Lady Manorwater ensconced in the great armchairs, and Mr.\nStocks casting a critic's eye over the unruly bookshelves.\n\nWratislaw's presence at first cast a certain awe on the assembly. His\nname was so painfully familiar, so consistently abused, that it was hard\nto refrain from curiosity. Lady Manorwater, an ancient ally, greeted\nhim effusively, and Alice cast shy glances at this strong man with the\nkind smile and awkward manners. The truth is that Wratislaw was acutely\nnervous. With Mr. Stocks alone was he at his ease. He shook his hand\nheartily, declared himself delighted to meet him again, and looked with\nsuch manifest favour on this opponent that the gentleman was cast into\nconfusion.\n\n\"I must talk shop,\" cried Lady Manorwater when they were seated at\ntable. \"Lewie, have you heard the news that poor Sir Robert has\nretired? What a treasure of a cook you have, sir! The poor man is\ngoing to travel, as his health is bad; he wrote me this morning. Now\nwho is to take his place? And I wish you'd get me the recipe for this\ntomato soup.\"\n\nLewis unravelled the tangled skein of his aunt's questions.\n\n\"I heard about Merkland last night from Wratislaw. I think, perhaps, I\nhad better make a confession to everybody. I never intended to bother\nwith party politics, at least not for a good many years, but some people\nwant me to stand, so I have agreed. You will have a very weak opponent,\nStocks, so I hope you will pardon my impertinence in trying the thing.\"\n\nThe candidate turned a little pale, but he smiled gallantly.\n\n\"I shall be glad to have so distinguished an opponent. But I thought\nthat yesterday you would never have dreamed of the thing.\"\n\n\"No more I should; but Wratislaw talked to me seriously and I was\npersuaded.\"\n\nWratislaw tried to look guileless, failed signally, and detected a\nsudden unfavourable glance from Mr. Stocks in his direction.\n\n\"We must manage everything as pleasantly as possible. You have my aunt\nand my uncle and Arthur on your side, while I have George, who doesn't\ncount in this show, and I hope Wratislaw. I'll give you a three days'\nstart if you like in lieu of notice.\" And the young man laughed as if\nthe matter were the simplest of jokes.\n\nThe laugh jarred very seriously on one listener. To Alice the morning\nhad been full of vexations, for Mr. Stocks had again sought her\ncompany, and wearied her with a new manner of would-be gallantry which\nsat ill upon him. She had come to Etterick with a tenderness towards\nLewis which was somewhat dispelled by his newly-disclosed political\naims. It meant that the Glenavelin household, including herself, would\nbe in a different camp for three dreary weeks, and that Mr. Stocks\nwould claim more of her society than ever. With feminine inconsistency\nshe visited her repugnance towards that gentleman on his innocent rival.\nBut Mr. Lewis Haystoun's light-hearted manner of regarding the business\nstruck the little Puritan deeper. Politics had always been a thing of\nthe gravest import in her eyes, bound up with a man's duty and honour\nand religion, and lo! here was this Gallio who not only adorned a party\nshe had been led to regard as reprobate, but treated the whole affair as\na half-jocular business, on which one should not be serious. It was\nsheer weakness, her heart cried out, the weakness of the philanderer,\nthe half-hearted. In her vexation her interest flew in sympathy to Mr.\nStocks, and she viewed him for the occasion with favour.\n\n\"You are far too frivolous about it,\" she cried. \"How can you fight if\nyou are not in earnest, and how can you speak things you only half\nbelieve? I hate to think of men playing at politics.\" And she had set\nher little white teeth, and sat flushed and diffident, a Muse of\nProtest.\n\nLewis flushed in turn. He recognized with pain the fulfilment of his\nfears. He saw dismally how during the coming fight he would sink daily\nin the estimation of this small critic, while his opponent would as\nconspicuously rise. The prospect did not soothe him, and he turned to\nBertha Afflint, who was watching the scene with curious eyes.\n\n\"It's very sad, Lewie,\" she said, \"but you'll get no canvassers from\nGlenavelin. We have all been pledged to Mr. Stocks for the last week.\nAlice is a keen politician, and, I believe, has permanently unsettled\nLord Manorwater's easy-going Liberalism. She believes in action;\nwhereas, you know, he does not.\"\n\n\"We all believe in action nowadays,\" said Wratislaw. \"I could wish at\ntimes for the revival of 'leisureliness' as a party catch-word.\"\n\nAnd then there ensued a passage of light arms between the great man and\nBertha which did not soothe Alice's vexation. She ignored the amiable\nGeorge, seeing in him another of the half-hearted, and in a fine heat of\nvirtue devoted herself to Mr. Stocks. That gentleman had been\nmelancholy, but the favour of Miss Wishart made him relax his heavy\nbrows and become communicative. He was flattered by her interest. She\nheard his reminiscences with a smile and his judgments with attention.\nSoon the whole table talked merrily, and two people alone were aware\nthat breaches yawned under the unanimity.\n\nArchness was not in Alice's nature, and still less was coquetry. When\nLewis after lunch begged to be allowed to show her his dwelling she did\nnot blush and simper, she showed no pretty reluctance, no graceful\ndispleasure. She thanked him, but coldly, and the two climbed the ridge\nabove the lake, whence the whole glen may be seen winding beneath. It\nwas still, hot July weather, and the far hills seemed to blink and\nshimmer in the haze; but at their feet was always coolness in the blue\ndepth of the loch, the heath-fringed shores, the dark pines, and the\ncold whinstone crags.\n\n\"You don't relish the prospect of the next month?\" she asked.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"After all, it is only a month, and it will\nall be over before the shooting begins.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand you,\" she cried suddenly and impatiently. \"People\ncall you ambitious, and yet you have to be driven by force to the\nsimplest move in the game, and all the while you are thinking and\ntalking as if a day's sport were of far greater importance.\"\n\n\"And it really vexes you--Alice?\" he said, with penitent eyes.\n\nShe drew swiftly away and turned her face, so that the man might not see\nthe vexation and joy struggling for mastery.\n\n\"Of course it is none of my business, but surely it is a pity.\" And the\nlittle doctrinaire walked with head erect to the edge of the slope and\nstudied intently the distant hills.\n\nThe man was half amused, half pained, but his evil star was in the\nascendant. Had he known it, he would have been plain and natural, for\nat no time had the girl ever been so near to him. Instead, he made some\nlaughing remark, which sounded harshly flippant in her ears. She looked\nat him reproachfully; it was cruel to treat her seriousness with scorn;\nand then, seeing Lady Manorwater and the others on the lawn below, she\nasked him with studied carelessness to take her back. Lewis obeyed\nmeekly, cursing in his heart his unhappy trick of an easy humour. If\nhis virtues were to go far to rob him of what he most cared for, it\nlooked black indeed for the unfortunate young man.\n\nMeantime Wratislaw and Mr. Stocks had drawn together by the attraction\nof opposites. A change had come over the latter, and momentarily\neclipsed his dignity. For the man was not without tact, and he felt\nthat the attitude of high-priest of all the virtues would not suit in\nthe presence of one whose favourite task it was to laugh his so-called\nvirtues to scorn. Such, at least to begin with, was his honourable\nintention. But the subtle Wratislaw drew him from his retirement and\nskilfully elicited his coy principles. It was a cruel performance--a\nshameless one, had there been any spectator. The one would lay down a\nfine generous line of policy; the other would beg for a fact in\nconfirmation. The one would haltingly detail some facts; the other\nwould promptly convince him of their falsity. Eventually the victim\ngrew angry and a little frightened. The real Mr. Stocks was a man of\nbusiness, not above making a deal with an opponent; and for a little the\nreal Mr. Stocks emerged from his shell.\n\n\"You won't speak much in the coming fight, will you? You see, you are\nrather heavy metal for a beginner like myself,\" he said, with commercial\nfrankness.\n\n\"No, my dear Stocks, to set your mind at rest, I won't. Lewis wants to\nbe knocked about a little, and he wants the fight to brace him. I'll\nleave him to fight his own battles, and wish good luck to the better\nman. Also, I won't come to your meetings and ask awkward questions.\"\n\nMr. Stocks bore malice only to his inferiors, and respected his betters\nwhen he was not on a platform. He thanked Wratislaw with great\nheartiness, and when Lady Manorwater found the two they were beaming on\neach other like the most ancient friends.\n\n\"Has anybody seen Lewie?\" she was asking. \"He is the most scandalous\nhost in the world. We can't find boats or canoes and we can't find him.\nOh, here is the truant!\" And the renegade host was seen in the wake of\nAlice descending from the ridge.\n\nSomething in the attitude of the two struck the lady with suspicion.\nWas it possible that she had been blind, and that her nephew was about\nto confuse her cherished schemes? This innocent woman, who went through\nthe world as not being of it, had fancied that already Alice had fallen\nin with her plans. She had seemed to court Mr. Stocks's company, while\nhe most certainly sought eagerly for hers. But Lewis, if he entered the\nlists, would be a perplexing combatant, and Lady Manorwater called her\ngods to witness that it should not be. Many motives decided her against\nit. She hated that a scheme of her own once made should be checkmated,\nthough it were by her dearest friend. More than all, her pride was in\narms. Lewis was a dazzling figure; he should make a great match; money\nand pretty looks and parvenu blood were not enough for his high\nmightiness.\n\nSo it came about that, when they had explored the house, circumnavigated\nthe loch, and had tea on a lawn of heather, she informed her party that\nshe must get out at Haystounslacks, for she wished to see the farmer,\nand asked Bertha to keep her company. The young woman agreed readily,\nwith the result that Alice and Mr. Stocks were left sole occupants of\nthe carriage for the better half of the way. The man was only too\nwilling to seize the chance thus divinely given him. His irritation at\nLewis's projects had been tempered by Alice's kindness at lunch and\nWratislaw's unlooked-for complaisance. Things looked rosy for him; far\noff, as on the horizon of his hopes, he saw a seat in Parliament and a\nfair and amply dowered wife.\n\nBut Miss Wishart was scarcely in so pleasant a humour. With Lewis she\nwas undeniably cross, but of Mr. Stocks she was radically intolerant.\nA moment of pique might send her to his side, but the position was\nunnatural and could not be maintained. Even now Lewis was in her\nthoughts. Fragments of his odd romantic speech clove to her memory.\nHis figure--for he showed to perfection in his own surroundings--was so\ncomely and gallant, so bright with the glamour of adventurous youth,\nthat for a moment this prosaic young woman was a convert to the coloured\nside of life and had forgotten her austere creed.\n\nMr. Stocks went about his duty with praise-worthy thoroughness. For\nthe fiftieth time in a week he detailed to her his prospects. When he\nhad raised a cloud-built castle of fine hopes, when he had with manly\nsimplicity repeated his confession of faith, he felt that the crucial\nmoment had arrived. Now, when she looked down the same avenue of\nprospect as himself, he could gracefully ask her to adorn the fair scene\nwith her presence.\n\n\"Alice,\" he said, and at the sound of her name the girl started from a\nreverie in which Lewis was not absent, and looked vacantly in his face.\n\nHe took it for maidenly modesty.\n\n\"I have wanted to speak to you for long, Alice. We have seen a good\ndeal of each other lately, and I have come to be very fond of you. I\ntrust you may have some liking for me, for I want you to promise to be\nmy wife.\"\n\nHe told his love in regular sentences. Unconsciously he had fallen into\nthe soft patronizing tone in which aforetime he had shepherded a Sunday\nschool.\n\nThe girl looked at the large sentimental face and laughed. She felt\nashamed of her rudeness even in the act.\n\nHe caught her hands, and before she knew his face was close to hers.\n\"Promise me, dear,\" he said. \"We have everything in common. Your\nfather will be delighted, and we will work together for the good of the\npeople. You are not meant to be a casual idler like the people at\nEtterick. You and I are working man and woman.\"\n\nIt was her turn to flush in downright earnest. The man's hot face\nsickened her. What were these wild words he was speaking? She dimly\ncaught their purport, heard the mention of Etterick, saw once again\nLewis with his quick, kindly eyes, and turned coldly to the lover.\n\n\"It is quite out of the question, Mr. Stocks,\" she said calmly. \"Of\ncourse I am obliged to you for the honour you have done me, but the\nthing is impossible.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" he cried, with angry eyes. \"Is it Lewis Haystoun?\"\n\nThe girl looked quickly at him, and he was silent, abashed. Strangely\nenough, at that moment she liked him better than ever before. She\nforgave him his rudeness and folly, his tactless speech and his comical\nface. He was in love with her, he offered her what he most valued, his\npolitical chances and his code of fine sentiments; it was not his blame\nif she found both little better than husks.\n\nHer attention flew for a moment to the place she had left, only to\nreturn to a dismal reflection. Was she not, after all, in the same\ngalley as her rejected suitor? What place had she in the frank\ngood-fellowship of Etterick, or what part had they in the inheritance of\nherself and her kind? Had not Mr. Stocks--now sitting glumly by her\nside--spoken the truth? We are only what we are made, and generations\nof thrift and seriousness had given her a love for the strenuous and the\nunadorned which could never be cast out. Here was a quandary--for at\nthe same instant there came the voice of the heart defiantly calling her\nto the breaking of idols.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHOME TRUTHS\n\n\nI\n\nIt is told by a great writer in his generous English that when the\nfollowers of Diabolus were arraigned before the Recorder and Mayor of\nregenerate Mansoul, a certain Mr. Haughty carried himself well to the\nlast. \"He declared,\" says Bunyan, \"that he had carried himself bravely,\nnot considering who was his foe or what was the cause in which he was\nengaged. It was enough for him if he fought like a man and came off\nvictorious.\" Nevertheless, we are told, he suffered the common doom,\nbeing crucified next day at the place of execution. It is the old fate\nof the freelance, the Hal o' the Wynd who fights for his own hand; for\nin life's contest the taking of sides is assumed to be a necessity.\n\nSuch was Lewis's reflections when he found Wratislaw waiting for him in\nthe Etterick dogcart when he emerged from a meeting in Gledsmuir. He\nhad now enjoyed ten days of it, and he was heartily tired. His throat\nwas sore with much speaking, his mind was barren with thinking on the\nunthinkable, and his spirits were dashed with a bitter sense of\nfutility. He had honestly done his best. So far his conscience was\nclear; but as he reviewed the past in detail, his best seemed a very\nshoddy compromise. It was comfort to see the rugged face of Wratislaw\nagain, though his greeting was tempered by mistrust. The great man had\nrefused to speak for him and left him to fight his own battles;\nmoreover, he feared the judgment of the old warrior on his conduct of\nthe fight. He was acutely conscious of the joints in his armour, but he\nhad hoped to have decently cloaked them from others. When he heard the\nfirst words, \"Well, Lewie, my son, you have been making a mess of it,\"\nhis heart sank.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said. \"But how?\"\n\n\"How? Why, my dear chap, you have no grip. You have let the thing get\nout of hand. I heard your speech to-night. It was excellent, very\nclever, a beautiful piece of work, but worse than useless for your\npurpose. You forget the sort of man you are fighting. Oh, I have been\nfollowing the business carefully, and I felt bound to come down to keep\nyou in order. To begin with, you have left your own supporters in the\nplace in a nice state of doubt.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Why, because you have given them nothing to catch hold of. They\nexpected the ordinary Conservative confession of faith--a rosy sketch of\nforeign affairs, and a little gentle Socialism, and the old rhetoric\nabout Church and State. Instead, they are put off with epigrams and\nexcellent stories, and a few speculations as to the metaphysical basis\nof politics. Believe me, Lewie, it is only the very general liking for\nyour unworthy self which keeps them from going over in a body to\nStocks.\" And Wratislaw lit a cigar and puffed furiously.\n\n\"Then you would have me deliver the usual insincere platitudes?\" said\nLewis dismally.\n\n\"I would have you do nothing of the kind. I thought you understood my\npoint of view. A man like Stocks speaks his platitudes with vehemence\nbecause he believes in them whole-heartedly. You have also your\nplatitudes to get through with, not because you would stake your soul on\nyour belief in them, but because they are as near as possible the\ninaccurate popular statement of your views, which is all that your\nconstituents would understand, and you pander to the popular craving\nbecause it is honest enough in itself and is for you the stepping-stone\nto worthier work.\"\n\nLewis shook his head dismally.\n\n\"I haven't the knack of it. I seem to stand beside myself and jeer all\nthe while. Besides, it would be opposing complete sincerity with a very\nshady substitute. That man Stocks is at least an honest fool. I met\nhim the other day after he had been talking some atrocious nonsense. I\nasked him as a joke how he could be such a humbug, and he told me quite\nhonestly that he believed every word; so, of course, I apologized. He\nwas attacking you people on your foreign policy, and he pulled out a New\nTestament and said, 'What do I read here?' It went down with many\npeople, but the thing took away my breath.\"\n\nHis companion looked perplexedly at the speaker. \"You have had the\nwrong kind of education, Lewie. You have always been the spoiled child,\nand easily and half-unconsciously you have mastered things which the\nself-made man has to struggle towards with a painful conscious effort.\nThe result is that you are a highly cultured man without any crudeness\nor hysteria, while the other people see things in the wrong perspective\nand run their heads against walls and make themselves miserable. You\ngain a lot, but you miss one thing. You know nothing of the heart of\nthe crowd. Oh, I don't mean the people about Etterick. They are your\nown folk, and the whole air of the place is semi-feudal. But the\nweavers and artisans of the towns and the ordinary farm workers--what do\nyou know of them? Your precious theories are so much wind in their\nears. They want the practical, the blatantly obvious, spiced with a\nlittle emotion. Stocks knows their demands. He began among them, and\nat present he is but one remove from them. A garbled quotation from the\nScriptures or an appeal to their domestic affections is the very thing\nrequired. Moreover, the man understands an audience. He can bully it,\nyou know; put on airs of sham independence to cover his real obeisance;\nwhile you are polite and deferent to hide your very obvious scorn.\"\n\n\"Do you know, Tommy, I'm a coward,\" Lewis broke in. \"I can't face the\npeople. When I see a crowd of upturned faces, crass, ignorant,\nunwholesome many of them, I begin to despair. I cannot begin to explain\nthings from the beginning; besides, they would not understand me if I\ndid. I feel I have nothing in common with them. They lead, most of\nthem, unhealthy indoor lives, their minds are half-baked, and their\nbodies half-developed. I feel a terrible pity, but all the same I\ncannot touch them. And then I become a coward and dare not face them\nand talk straight as man to man. I repeat my platitudes to the ceiling,\nand they go away thinking, and thinking rightly, that I am a fool.\"\n\nWratislaw looked worried. \"That is one of my complaints. The other is\nthat on certain occasions you cannot hold yourself in check. Do you\nknow you have been blackguarded in the papers lately, and that there is\na violent article against you in the Critic, and all on account of some\nunwise utterances?\"\n\nLewis flushed deeply. \"That is the worst thing I have done, and I feel\nhorribly penitent. It was the act of a cad and a silly schoolboy. But\nI had some provocation, Tommy. I had spoken at length amid many\ninterruptions, and I was getting cross. It was at Gledfoot, and the\nmeeting was entirely against me. Then a man got up to tackle me, not a\nnative, but some wretched London agitator. As I looked at him--a little\nchap with fiery eyes and receding brow--and heard his cockney patter, my\ntemper went utterly. I made a fool of him, and I abused the whole\nassembly, and, funnily enough, I carried them with me. People say I\nhelped my cause immensely.\"\n\n\"It is possible,\" said Wratislaw dryly. \"The Scot has a sense of humour\nand has no objection to seeing his prophets put to shame. But you are\ngetting a nice reputation elsewhere. When I read some of your sayings,\nI laughed of course, but I thought ruefully of your chances.\"\n\nIt was a penitent and desponding man who followed Wratislaw into the\nsnuggery at Etterick. But light and food, the gleam of silver and\nvellum and the sweet fragrance of tobacco consoled him; for in most\nmatters he was half-hearted, and politics sat lightly on his affections.\n\n\nII\n\nTo Alice the weeks of the contest were filled with dire unpleasantness.\nLewis, naturally, kept far from Glenavelin, while of Mr. Stocks she was\nnever free. She followed Lady Manorwater's lead and canvassed\nvigorously, hoping to find distraction in the excitement of the fight.\nBut her efforts did not prosper. On one occasion she found herself in a\ncottage on the Gledsmuir road, her hands filled with election\nliterature. A hale old man was sitting at his meal, who greeted her\ncordially, and made her sit down while she stumbled through the usual\nquestions and exhortations. \"Are ye no' bidin' at Glenavelin?\" he\nasked. \"And have I no seen ye walking on the hill wi' Maister Lewie?\"\nWhen the girl assented, he asked, with the indignation of the\nprivileged, \"Then what for are ye sac keen this body Stocks should win\nin? If Maister Lewie's fond o' ye, wad it no be wiser--like to wark for\nhim? Poalitics! What should a woman's poalitics be but just the same\nas her lad's? I hae nae opeenion o' this clash about weemen's\neddication.\" And with flaming cheeks the poor girl had risen and fled\nfrom the old reactionary.\n\nThe incident burned into her mind, and she was wretched with the anomaly\nof her position. A dawning respect for her rejected lover began to rise\nin her heart. The first of his meetings which she attended had\nimpressed her with his skill in his own vocation. He had held those\npeople interested. He had spoken bluntly, strongly, honestly. To few\nwomen is it given to distinguish the subtle shades of sincerity in\nspeech, and to the rule Alice was no exception. The rhetoric and the\ncheers which followed had roused the speaker to a new life. His face\nbecame keen, almost attractive, without question full of power. He was\nan orator beyond doubt, and when he concluded in a riot of applause,\nAlice sat with small hands clenched and eyes shining with delight. He\nhad spoken the main articles of her creed, but with what force and\nfreshness! She was convinced, satisfied, delighted; though somewhere in\nher thought lurked her old dislike of the man and the memory of another.\n\nAs ill-luck would have it, the next night she went to hear Lewis in\nGledsmuir, when that young gentleman was at his worst. She went\nunattended, being a fearless young woman, and consequently found herself\nin the very back of the hall crowded among some vehement politicians.\nThe audience, to begin with, was not unkind. Lewis was greeted with\napplause, and at the first heard with patience. But his speech was\nvague, incoherent, and tactless. To her unquiet eyes he seemed to be\nafraid of the men before him. Every phrase was guarded with a proviso,\nand \"possiblys\" bristled in every sentence. The politicians at the back\ngrew restless, and Alice was compelled to listen to their short,\nscathing criticisms. Soon the meeting was hopelessly out of hand. Men\nrose and rudely marched to the door. Catcalls were frequent from the\ncorners, and the back of the hall became aggressive. The girl had sat\nwith white, pained face, understanding little save that Lewis was\ntalking nonsense and losing all grip on his hearers. In spite of\nherself she was contrasting this fiasco with the pithy words of Mr.\nStocks. When the meeting became unruly she looked for some display of\ncharacter, some proof of power. Mr. Stocks would have fiercely cowed\nthe opposition, or at least have spoken the last word in any quarrel.\nLewis's conduct was different. He shrugged his shoulders, made some\nlaughing remark to a friend on the platform, and with all the\nnonchalance in the world asked the meeting if they wished to hear any\nmore. A claque of his supporters replied with feigned enthusiasm, but a\nmalcontent at Alice's side rose and stamped to the door. \"I came to\nhear sense,\" he cried, \"and no this bairn's-blethers!\"\n\nThe poor girl was in despair. She had fancied him a man of power and\nambition, a doer, a man of action. But he was no more than a creature\nof words and sentiment, graceful manners, and an engaging appearance.\nThe despised Mr. Stocks was the real worker. She had laughed at his\nincessant solemnity as the badge of a fool, and adored Lewis's\nlight-heartedness as the true air of the great. But she had been\nmistaken. Things were what they seemed. The light-hearted was the\nhalf-hearted, \"the wandering dilettante,\" Mr. Stocks had called him,\n\"the worst type of the pseudo-culture of our universities.\" She told\nherself she hated the whole affectation of breeding and chivalry. Those\nmen--Lewis and his friends--were always kind and soft-spoken to her and\nher sex. Her soul hated it; she cried aloud for equal treatment, for a\nshare of the iron and rigour of life. Their manners were a mere cloak\nfor contempt. If they could only be rude to a woman, it would be a\nwelcome relief from this facile condescension. What had she or any\nwoman with brains to do in that galley? They despised her kind, with\nthe scorn of sultans who chose their women-folk for looks and graces.\nThe thought was degrading, and a bitterness filled her heart against the\nwhole clique of easy aristocrats. Mr. Stocks was her true ally. To\nhim she was a woman, an equal; to them she was an engaging child, a\ndelicate toy.\n\nSo far she went in her heresy, but no farther. It is a true saying that\nyou will find twenty heroic women before you may meet one generous one;\nbut Alice was not wholly without this rarest of qualities. The memory\nof a frank voice, very honest grey eyes, and a robust cheerfulness\nbrought back some affection for the erring Lewis. The problem was\nbeyond her reconciling efforts, so the poor girl, torn between common\nsense and feeling, and recognizing with painful clearness the complexity\nof life, found refuge in secret tears.\n\nIII\n\nThe honours of the contest, so far as Lewis's party was concerned, fell\nto George Winterham, and this was the fashion of the event. He had been\ndragged reluctantly into the thing, foreseeing dire disaster for\nhimself, for he knew little and cared less about matters political,\nthough he was ready enough at a pinch to place his ignorance at his\nfriend's disposal. So he had been set to the dreary work of\ncommittee-rooms; and then, since his manners were not unpleasing,\ndispatched as aide-de-camp to any chance orator who enlivened the\ncounty. But at last a crisis arrived in which other use was made of\nhim. A speaker of some pretensions had been announced for a certain\nnight at the considerable village of Allerfoot. The great man failed,\nand as it was the very eve of the election none could be found for his\nplace. Lewis was in despair, till he thought of George. It was a\ndesperate chance, but the necessity was urgent, so, shutting himself up\nfor an hour, he wrote the better part of a speech which he entrusted to\nhis friend to prepare. George, having a good memory, laboriously\nlearned it by heart, and clutching the friendly paper and\nwhole-heartedly abusing his chief, he set out grimly to his fate.\n\nPromptly at the hour of eight he was deposited at the door of the\nMasonic Hail in Allerfoot. The place seemed full, and a nervous\nchairman was hovering around the gate. News of the great man's\ndefection had already been received, and he was in the extremes of\nnervousness. He greeted George as a saviour, and led him inside, where\nsome three hundred people crowded a small whitewashed building. The\nvillage of Allerfoot itself is a little place, but it is the centre of a\nwide pastoral district, and the folk assembled were brown-faced herds\nand keepers from the hills, plough-men from the flats of Glen Aller, a\nfew fishermen from the near sea-coast, as well as the normal inhabitants\nof the village.\n\nGeorge was wretchedly nervous and sat in a cold sweat while the chairman\nexplained that the great Mr. S---- deeply regretted that at the last\nmoment he was unfortunately compelled to break so important an\nengagement, but that he had sent in his stead Mr. George Winterham,\nwhose name was well known as a distinguished Oxford scholar and a rising\nbarrister. George, who had been ploughed twice for Smalls and had\neventually taken a pass degree, and to whom the law courts were nearly\nas unknown as the Pyramids, groaned inwardly at the astounding news.\nThe audience might have been a turnip field for all the personality it\npossessed for him. He heard their applause as the chairman sat down\nmopping his brow, and he rose to his feet conscious that he was smiling\nlike an idiot. He made some introductory remarks of his own--that \"he\nwas sorry the other chap hadn't turned up, that he was happy to have the\nprivilege of expounding to them his views on this great subject \"--and\nthen with an ominous sinking of heart plucked forth his papers and\nlaunched into the unknown.\n\nThe better part of the speech was wiped clean from his memory at the\nstart, so he had to lean heavily on the written word. He read rapidly\nbut without intelligence. Now and again a faint cheer would break the\neven flow, and he would look up for a moment with startled eyes, only to\ngo off again with quickened speed. He found himself talking neat\nparadoxes which he did not understand, and speaking glibly of names\nwhich to him were no more than echoes. Eventually he came to an end at\nleast twenty minutes before a normal political speech should close, and\nsat down, hot and perplexed, with a horrible sense of having made a fool\nof himself.\n\nThe chairman, no less perplexed, made the usual remarks and then called\nfor questions, for the time had to be filled in somehow. The words left\nGeorge aghast. The wretched man looked forward to raw public shame.\nHis ignorance would be exposed, his presumption laid bare, his pride\nthrown in the dust. He nerved himself for a despairing effort. He\nwould brazen things out as far as possible; afterwards, let the heavens\nfall.\n\nAn old minister rose and asked in a thin ancient voice what the\nGovernment had done for the protection of missionaries in\nKhass-Kotannun. Was he, Mr. Winterham, aware that our missionaries in\nthat distant land had been compelled to wear native dress by the\narrogant chiefs, and so fallen victims to numerous chills and epidemics?\n\nGeorge replied that he considered the treatment abominable, believed\nthat the matter occupied the mind of the Foreign Office night and day,\nand would be glad personally to subscribe to any relief fund. The good\nman declared himself satisfied, and St. Sebastian breathed freely\nagain.\n\nA sturdy man in homespun rose to discover the Government's intention on\nChurch matters. Did the speaker ken that on his small holding he paid\nten pound sterling in tithes, though he himself did not hold with the\nEstablishment, being a Reformed Presbyterian? The Laodicean George said\nhe did not understand the differences, but that it seemed to him a\nconfounded shame, and he would undertake that Mr. Haystoun, if\nreturned, would take immediate steps in the matter.\n\nSo far he had done well, but with the next question he betrayed his\nignorance. A good man arose, also hot on Church affairs, to discourse\non some disabilities, and casually described himself as a U.P. George's\nwits busied themselves in guessing at the mystic sign. At last to his\ndelight he seemed to achieve it, and, in replying, electrified his\naudience by assuming that the two letters stood for Unreformed\nPresbyterian.\n\nBut the meeting was in good humour in spite of his incomprehensible\naddress and unsatisfying answers, till a small section of the young\nbloods of the opposite party, who had come to disturb, felt that this\npeace must be put an end to. Mr. Samuel M'Turk, lawyer's clerk, who\nhailed from the west country and betrayed his origin in his speech, rose\namid some applause from his admirers to discomfit George. He was a\nyoung man with a long, sallow face, carefully oiled and parted hair, and\na resonant taste in dress. A bundle of papers graced his hand, and his\nair was parliamentary.\n\n\"Wis Mister Winterham aware that Mister Haystoun had contradicted\nhimself on two occasions lately, as he would proceed to show?\"\n\nGeorge heard him patiently, said that now he was aware of the fact, but\ncouldn't for the life of him see what the deuce it mattered.\n\n\"After Mister Winterham's ignoring of my pint,\" went on the young man,\n\"I proceed to show ...\" and with all the calmness in the world he\ndisplayed to his own satisfaction how Mr. Lewis Haystoun was no fit\nperson to represent the constituency. He profaned the Sabbath, which\nthis gentleman professed to hold dear, he was notorious for drunkenness,\nand his conduct abroad had not been above suspicion.\n\nGeorge was on his feet in a moment, his confusion gone, his face very\nred, and his shoulders squared for a fight. The man saw the effect of\nhis words, and promptly sat down.\n\n\"Get up,\" said George abruptly.\n\nThe man's face whitened and he shrank back among his friends.\n\n\"Get up; up higher--on the top of the seat, that everybody may see and\nhear you! Now repeat very carefully all that over again.\"\n\nThe man's confidence had deserted him. He stammered something about\nmeaning no harm.\n\n\"You called my friend a drunken blackguard. I am going to hear the\naccusation in detail.\" George stood up to his full height, a terrible\nfigure to the shrinking clerk, who repeated his former words with a\nfaltering tongue.\n\nHe heard him out quietly, and then stared coolly down on the people. He\nfelt himself master of the situation. The enemy had played into his\nhands, and in the shape of a sweating clerk sat waiting on his action.\n\n\"You have heard what this man has to tell you. I ask you as men, as\nfolk of this countryside, if it is true?\"\n\nIt was the real speech of the evening, which was all along waiting to be\ndelivered instead of the frigid pedantries on the paper. A man was\nspeaking simply, valiantly, on behalf of his friend. It was cunningly\ndone, with the natural tact which rarely deserts the truly honest man in\nhis hour of extremity. He spoke of Lewis as he had known him, at school\nand college and in many wild sporting expeditions in desert places, and\nslowly the people kindled and listened. Then, so to speak, he kicked\naway the scaffolding of his erection. He ceased to be the apologist,\nand became the frank eulogist. He stood squarely on the edge of the\nplatform, gathering the eyes of his hearers, smiling pleasantly, arms\nakimbo, a man at his ease and possibly at his pleasure.\n\n\"Some of you are herds,\" he cried, \"and some are fishers, and some are\nfarmers, and some are labourers. Also some of you call yourselves\nRadicals or Tories or Socialists. But you are all of you far more than\nthese things. You are men--men of this great countryside, with blood in\nyour veins and vigour in that blood. If you were a set of pale-faced\nmechanics, I should not be speaking to you, for I should not understand\nyou. But I know you all, and I like you, and I am going to prevent you\nfrom making godless fools of yourselves. There are two men before you.\nOne is a very clever man, whom I don't know anything about, nor you\neither. The other is my best friend, and known to all of you. Many of\nyou have shot or sailed with him, many of you were born on his and his\nfathers' lands. I have told you of his abilities and quoted better\njudges than myself. I don't need to tell you that he is the best of\nmen, a sportsman, a kind master, a very good fellow indeed. You can\nmake up your mind between the two. Opinions matter very little, but\ngood men are too scarce to be neglected. Why, you fools,\" he cried with\nboisterous good humour, \"I should back Lewis if he were a Mohammedan or\nan Anarchist. The man is sound metal, I tell you, and that's all I\nask.\"\n\nIt was a very young man's confession of faith, but it was enough. The\nmeeting went with him almost to a man. A roar of applause greeted the\nsmiling orator, and when he sat down with flushed face, bright eyes, and\na consciousness of having done his duty, John Sanderson, herd in Nether\nCallowa, rose to move a vote of confidence:\n\n\"That this assembly is of opinion that Maister Lewis Haystoun is a guid\nman, and sae is our friend Maister Winterham, and we'll send Lewie back\nto Parliament or be--\"\n\nIt was duly seconded and carried with acclamation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE PRIDE BEFORE A FALL\n\n\nThe result of the election was announced in Gledsmuir on the next\nWednesday evening, and carried surprise to all save Lewis's nearer\nfriends. For Mr. Albert Stocks was duly returned member for the\nconstituency by a majority of seventy votes. The defeated candidate\nreceived the news with great composure, addressed some good-humoured\nwords to the people, had a generous greeting for his opponent, and met\nhis committee with a smiling face. But his heart was sick within him,\nand as soon as he decently might he escaped from the turmoil, found his\nhorse, and set off up Glenavelin for his own dwelling.\n\nHe had been defeated, and the fact, however confidently looked for,\ncomes with a bitter freshness to every man. He had lost a seat for his\nparty--that in itself was bad. But he had proved himself incompetent,\nunadaptable, a stick, a pedantic incapable. A dozen stings rankled in\nhis soul. Alice would be justified of her suspicions. Where would his\nplace be now in that small imperious heart? His own people had forsaken\nhim for a gross and unlikely substitute, and he had been wrong in his\nestimate alike of ally and enemy. Above all came that cruelest\nstab--what would Wratislaw think of it? He had disgraced himself in the\neyes of his friend. He who had made a fetish of competence had\nmanifestly proved wanting; he who had loved to think of himself as the\nbold, opportune man, had shown himself formal and hidebound.\n\nAs he passed Glenavelin among the trees the thought of Alice was a sharp\npang of regret. He could never more lift his eyes in that young and\nradiant presence. He pictured the successful Stocks welcomed by her,\nand words of praise for which he would have given his immortal soul,\nmeted out lavishly to that owl-like being. It was a dismal business,\nand ruefully, but half-humorously, he caught at the paradox of his fate.\n\nThrough the swiftly failing darkness the inn of Etterick rose before\nhim, a place a little apart from the village street. A noise of talk\nfloated from the kitchen and made him halt at the door and dismount.\nThe place would be full of folk discussing the election, and he would go\nin among them and learn the worst opinion which men might have of him.\nAfter all, they were his own people, who had known him in his power as\nthey now saw him in his weakness. If he had failed he was not wholly\nfoolish; they knew his few redeeming virtues, and they would be\ngenerous.\n\nThe talk stopped short as he entered, and he saw through the tobacco\nreek half a dozen lengthy faces wearing the air of solemnity which the\nhillman adopts in his pleasures. They were all his own herds and\nkeepers, save two whom he knew for foresters from Glenavelin. He was\nrecognized at once, and with a general nervous shuffling they began to\nmake room for the laird at the table. He cried a hasty greeting to all,\nand sat down between a black-bearded giant, whose clothes smelt of\nsheep, and a red-haired man from one of the remoter glens. The notion\nof the thing pleased him, and he ordered drinks for each with a lavish\ncarelessness. He asked for a match for his pipe, and the man who gave\nit wore a decent melancholy on his face and shook his head with unction.\n\n\"This is a bad job, Lewie,\" he said, using the privileged name of the\nancient servant. \"Whae would have ettled sic a calaamity to happen in\nyour ain countryside? We a' thocht it would be a grand pioy for ye, for\nye would settle down here and hae nae mair foreign stravaigins. And\nthen this tailor body steps in and spoils a'. It's maist vexaatious.\"\n\n\"It was a good fight, and he beat me fairly; but we'll drop the matter.\nI'm sick--tired of politics, Adam. If I had been a better man they\nmight have made a herd of me, and I should have been happy.\"\n\n\"Wheesht, Lewie,\" said the man, grinning. \"A herd's job is no for the\nlikes o' you. But there's better wark waiting for ye than poalitics.\nIt's a beggar's trade after a', and far better left to bagman bodies\nlike yon Stocks. It's a puir thing for sac proper a man as you.\"\n\n\"But what can I do?\" cried Lewis in despair. \"I have no profession. I\nam useless.\"\n\n\"Useless! Ye are a grand judge o' sheep and nowt, and ye ken a horse\nbetter than ony couper. Ye can ride like a jockey and drive like a\nJehu, and there's no your equal in these parts with a gun or a\nfishing-rod. Forbye, I would rather walk ae mile on the hill wi' ye\nthan twae, for ye gang up a brae-face like a mawkin! God! There's no a\nsingle man's trade that ye're no brawly fitted for. And then ye've a\nheap o' book-lear that folk learned ye away about England, though I\ncannot speak muckle on that, no being a jidge.\"\n\nLewis grinned at the portraiture. \"You do me proud. But let's talk\nabout serious things. You were on sheep when I came in. Get back to\nthem and give me your mind on Cheviots. The lamb sales promise well.\"\n\nFor twenty minutes the room hummed with technicalities. One man might\nsupport the conversation on alien matters, but on sheep the humblest\nfound a voice: Lewis watched the ring of faces with a sharp delight.\nThe election had made him sick of his fellows--fellows who chattered and\nwrangled and wallowed in the sentimental. But now every line of these\nbrown faces, the keen blue eyes, the tawny, tangled beards, and the\ninimitable soft-sounding southern speech, seemed an earnest of a real\nand strenuous life. He began to find a new savour in existence. The\nsense of his flat incompetence left him, and he found himself speaking\nheartily and laughing with zest.\n\n\"It's as I say,\" said the herd of the Redswirebead. \"I'm getting an\nauld man and a verra wise ane, and the graund owercome for the world is\njust 'Pay no attention.' Ye'll has heard how the word cam' to be. It\nwas Jock Linklater o' the Caulds wha was glen notice to quit by the\nlaird, and a' the countryside was vexed to pairt wi' Jock, for he was a\npopular character. But about a year after a friend meets him at\nGledsmuir merkit as crouse as ever. 'Lodsake, Jock, man, I thocht ye\nwere awa',' says he. 'No,' says Jock, 'no. I'm here as ye see.' 'But\nhow did ye manage it?' he asked. 'Fine,' says Jock. 'They sent me a\nletter tellin' me I must gang; but I just payed no attention. Syne they\nsent me a blue letter frae the lawyer's, but I payed no attention. Syne\nthe factor cam' to see me.' 'Ay, and what did ye do then, Jock?' says\nhe. 'Oh, I payed no attention. Syne the laird cam' himsel.' 'Ay, that\nwould fricht ye,' he says. 'No, no a grain,' said Jock, verra calm. 'I\njust payed no attention, and here I am.'\"\n\nLewis laughed, but the rest of the audience suffered no change of\nfeature. The gloaming had darkened, and the little small-paned window\nwas a fretted sheet of dark and lucent blue. Grateful odours of food\nand drink and tobacco hung in the air, though tar and homespun and the\nfar-carried fragrance of peat fought stoutly for the mastery.\n\nOne man fell to telling of a fox-hunt, when he lay on the hill for the\nnight and shot five of the destroyers of his flock before the morning,\nit was the sign--and the hour--for stories of many kinds--tales of\nweather and adventure, humorous lowland escapades and dismal mountain\nrealities. Or stranger still, there would come the odd, half-believed\nlegends of the glen, told shamefully yet with the realism of men for\nwhom each word had a power and meaning far above fiction. Lewis\nlistened entranced, marking his interest now by an exclamation, and\nagain by a question.\n\nThe herd of Farawa told of the salmon, the king of the Aller salmon, who\nswam to the head of Aller and then crossed the spit of land to the head\nof Callowa to meet the king of the Callowa fish. It was a humorous\nstory, and was capped there and then by his cousin of the Dreichill, who\ntold a ghastly tale of a murder in the wilds. Then a lonely man, Simon\no' the Heid o' the Hope, glorified his powers on a January night when he\nswung himself on a flood-gate over the Aller while the thing quivered\nbeneath him, and the water roared redly above his thighs.\n\n\"And that yett broke when I was three pairts ower, and I went down the\nriver with my feet tangled in the bars and nae room for sweemin'. But I\ngripped an oak-ritt and stelled mysel' for an hour till the water\nknockit the yett to sawdust. It broke baith my ankles, and though I'm a\nmortal strong man in my arms, thae twisted kitts keepit me helpless.\nWhen a man's feet are broke he has nae strength in his wrist.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Lewis, with excitement. \"I have found the same myself.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked the man, without rudeness.\n\n\"Once on the Skifso when I was after salmon, and once in the Doorab\nhills above Abjela.\"\n\n\"Were ye sick when they rescued ye? I was. I had twae muscles sprung\non my arm, but that was naething to the retching and dizziness when they\nlaid me on the heather. Jock Jeffrey was bending ower me, and though he\nwasna touching me I began to suffocate, and yet I was ower weak to cry\nout and had to thole it.\"\n\n\"I know. If you hang up in the void for a little and get the feeling of\ngreat space burned on your mind, you nearly die of choking when you are\npulled up. Fancy you knowing about that.\"\n\n\"Have you suffered it, Maister Lewie?\" said the man.\n\n\"Once. There was a gully in the Doorabs just like the Scarts o' the\nMuneraw, only twenty times deeper, and there was a bridge of tree-trunks\nbound with ropes across it. We all got over except one mule and a\ncouple of men. They were just getting off when a trunk slipped and\ndangled down into the abyss with one end held up by the ropes. The poor\nanimal went plumb to the bottom; we heard it first thud on a jag of rock\nand then, an age after, splash in the water. One of the men went with\nit, but the other got his legs caught between the ropes and the tree and\nmanaged to hang on. The poor beggar was helpless with fright; and he\nsquealed--great heavens! how he did squeal!\"\n\n\"And what did ye dae?\" asked a breathless audience.\n\n\"I went down after him. I had to, for I was his master, and besides, I\nwas a bit of an athlete then. I cried to him to hang on and not look\ndown. I clambered down the swaying trunk while my people held the ropes\nat the top, and when I got near the man I saw what had happened.\n\n\"He had twisted his ankles in the fall, and though he had got them out\nof the ropes, yet they hung loose and quite obviously broken. I got as\nnear him as I could, and leaned over, and I remember seeing through\nbelow his armpits the blue of the stream six hundred feet down. It made\nme rather sick with my job, and when I called him to pull himself up a\nbit till I could grip him I thought he was helpless with the same\nfright. But it turned out that I had misjudged him. He had no power in\nhis arms, simply the dead strength to hang on. I was in a nice fix, for\nI could lower myself no farther without slipping into space. Then I\nthought of a dodge. I got a good grip of the rope and let my legs\ndangle down till they were level with his hands. I told him to try and\nchange his grip and catch my ankles. He did it, somehow or other, and\nby George! the first shock of his weight nearly ended me, for he was a\nheavy man. However, I managed to pull myself up a yard or two and then\nI could reach down and catch his arms. We both got up somehow or other,\nbut it took a devilish time, and when they laid us both on the ground\nand came round like fools with brandy I thought I should choke and had\nscarcely strength to swear at them to get out.\"\n\nThe assembly had listened intently, catching its breath with a sharp\n_risp_ as all outdoor folks will do when they hear of an escapade which\nstrikes their fancy. One man--a stranger--hammered his empty pipe-bowl\non the table in applause.\n\n\"Whae was the man, d'ye say?\" he asked. \"A neeger?\"\n\nLewis laughed. \"Not a nigger most certainly, though he had a brown\nface.\"\n\n\"And ye risked your life for a black o' some kind? Man, ye must be\nawfu' fond o' your fellow men. Wad ye dae the same for the likes o' us?\n\n\"Surely. For one of my own folk! But it was really a very small\nthing.\"\n\n\"Then I have just ae thing to say,\" said the brown-bearded man. \"I am\nwhat ye cal a Raadical, and yestreen I recorded my vote for yon man\nStocks. He crackit a lot about the rights o' man--as man, and I was wi'\nhim. But I tell ye that you yoursel' have a better notion o' human\nkindness than ony Stocks, and though ye're no o' my party, yet I\nherewith propose a vote o' confidence in Maister Lewis Haystoun.\"\n\nThe health was drunk solemnly yet with gusto, and under cover of it\nLewis fled out of doors. His despondency had passed, and a fit of\nfierce exhilaration had seized him. Men still swore by his name; he was\nstill loved by his own folk; small matter to him if a townsman had\ndefeated him. He was no vain talker, but a doer, a sportsman, an\nadventurer. This was his true career. Let others have the applause of\nexcited indoor folk or dull visionaries; for him a man's path, a man's\nwork, and a man's commendation.\n\nThe moon was up, riding high in a shoreless sea of blue, and in the\nstill weather the streams called to each other from the mountain sides,\nas in some fantastic cosmic harmony. High on the ridge shoulder the\nlights of Etterick twinkled starlike amid the fretted veil of trees. A\nsense of extraordinary and crazy exhilaration, the recoil from the\nconstraint of weeks, laid hold on his spirit. He hummed a dozen\nfragments of song, and at times would laugh with the pure pleasure of\nlife. The quixotic, the generous, the hopeless, the successful;\nlaughter and tears; death and birth; the warm hearth and the open\nroad--all seemed blent for the moment into one great zest for living.\n\"I'll to Lochiel and Appin and kneel to them,\" he was humming aloud,\nwhen suddenly his bridle was caught and a man's hand was at his knee.\n\n\"Lewie,\" cried Wratislaw, \"gracious, man! have you been drinking?\" And\nthen seeing the truth, he let go the bridle, put an arm through the\nstirrup leathers, and walked by the horse's side. \"So that's the way\nyou take it, old chap? Do you know that you are a discredited and\ndefeated man? and yet I find you whistling like a boy. I have hopes\nfor you, Lewie. You have the Buoyant Heart, and with that nothing can\nmuch matter. But, confound it! you are hours late for dinner.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nPASTORAL AND TRAGEDY\n\n\nThe news of the election, brought to Glenavelin by a couple of ragged\nrunners, had a different result from that forecast by Lewis. Alice\nheard it with a heart unquickened; and when, an hour after, the flushed,\ntriumphant Mr. Stocks arrived in person to claim the meed of success,\nhe was greeted with a painful carelessness. Lady Manorwater had been\nloud in her laments for her nephew, but to Mr. Stocks she gave the\nhonest praise which a warm-hearted woman cannot withhold from the\nfighter.\n\n\"Our principles have won,\" she cried. \"Now who will call the place a\nTory stronghold? Oh, Mr. Stocks, you have done wonderfully, and I am\nvery glad. I'm not a bit sorry for Lewis, for he well deserved his\nbeating.\"\n\nBut with Alice there could be neither pleasure nor its simulation. Her\nterrible honesty forbade her the easy path of false congratulations.\nShe bit her lip till tears filled her eyes. What was this wretched\nposition into which she had strayed? Lewis was all she had feared, but\nhe was Lewis, and far more than any bundle of perfections. A hot,\npassionate craving for his presence was blinding her to reason. And\nthis man who had won--this, the fortunate politician--she cared for him\nnot a straw. A strong dislike began to grow in her heart to the\nblameless Mr. Stocks.\n\nDinner that night was a weary meal to the girl. Lady Manorwater\nprattled about the day's events, and Lord Manorwater, hopelessly bored,\nate his food in silence. The lively Bertha had gone to bed with a\nheadache, and the younger Miss Afflint was the receptacle for the moment\nof her hostess's confidences. Alice sat between Mr. Stocks and Arthur,\nfacing a tall man with a small head and immaculate hair who had ridden\nover to dine and sleep. One of the two had the wisdom to see her humour\nand keep silent, though the thought plunged him into a sea of ugly\nreflections. It would be hard if, now that things were going well with\nhim, the lady alone should prove obdurate. For in all this politician's\ndaydreams a dainty figure walked by his side, sat at his table's head,\nreceived his friends, fascinated austere ministers, and filled his pipe\nof an evening at home.\n\nArthur was silent, and to him the lady turned in vain. He treated her\nwith an elaborate politeness which sat ill on his brusque manners, and\nfor the most part showed no desire to enliven the prevailing dulness.\nBut after dinner he carried her off to the gardens on the plea of fresh\nair and a fine sunset, and the girl, who liked the boy, went gladly.\nThen the reason of his silence was made plain. He dismayed her by\nbecoming lovesick.\n\n\"Tell me your age, Alice,\" he implored.\n\n\"I am twenty at Christmas time,\" said the girl, amazed at the question.\n\n\"And I am seventeen or very nearly that. Men sometimes marry women\nolder than themselves, and I don't see why I shouldn't. Oh, Alice,\npromise that you will marry me. I never met a girl I liked so much, and\nI am sure we should be happy.\"\n\n\"I am sure we should,\" said the girl, laughing. \"You silly boy! what\nput such nonsense in your head? I am far too old for you, and though I\nlike you very much, I don't in the least want to marry you.\" She seemed\nto herself to have got out of a sober world into a sort of Mad\nTea-party, where people behaved like pantaloons and spoke in conundrums.\n\nThe boy flushed and his eyes grew cross. \"Is it somebody else?\" he\nasked; at which the girl, with a memory of Mr. Stocks, reflected on the\ndreadful monotony of men's ways.\n\nA solution flashed upon his brain. \"Are you going to marry Lewie\nHaystoun?\" he cried in a more cheerful voice. After all, Lewis was his\ncousin, and a worthy rival.\n\nAlice grew hotly uncomfortable. \"I am not going to marry Mr. Lewis\nHaystoun, and I am not going to talk to you any more.\" And she turned\nround with a flaming face to the cool depths of the wood.\n\n\"Then it is that fellow Stocks. Oh, Lord!\" groaned Arthur, irritated\ninto bad manners. \"You can't mean it, Alice. He's not fit to black\nyour boots.\"\n\nSome foolish impulse roused the girl to reply. She defended the very\nman against whom all the evening she had been unreasonably bitter. \"You\nhave no right to abuse him. He is your people's guest and a very\ndistinguished man, and you are only a foolish boy.\"\n\nHe paled below his sunburn. Now he believed the truth of the horrid\nsuspicion which had been fastening on his mind. \"But--but,\" he\nstammered, \"the chap isn't a gentleman, you know.\"\n\nThe words quickened her vexation. A gentleman! The cant word, the\nfetish of this ring of idle aristocrats--she knew the hollowness of the\nwhole farce. The democrat in her made her walk off with erect head and\nbright eyes, leaving a penitent boy behind; while all the time a sick,\nlonging heart drove her to the edge of tears.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days dragged slowly for the girl. The brightness had gone out of\nthe wide, airy landscape, and the warm August days seemed chill. She\nhated herself for the wrong impression she had left on the boy Arthur's\nmind, but she was too proud to seek to erase it; she could but trust to\nhis honour for silence. If Lewis heard--the thought was too terrible to\nface! He would resign himself to the inevitable; she knew the temper of\nthe man. Good form was his divinity, and never by word or look would he\nattempt to win another man's betrothed. She must see him and learn the\ntruth: but he came no more to Glenavelin, and Etterick was a far cry for\na girl's fancy. Besides, the Twelfth had come and the noise of guns on\nevery hill spoke of other interests for the party at Etterick. Lewis\nhad forgotten his misfortunes, she told herself, and in the easy way of\nthe half-hearted found in bodily fatigue a drug for a mind but little in\nneed of it.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nOne afternoon Lady Manorwater came over the lawn waving a letter. \"Do\nyou want to go and picnic to-morrow, Alice?\" she cried. \"Lewis is to\nbe shooting on the moors at the head of the Avelin, and he wants us to\ncome and lunch at the Pool of Ness. He wants the whole party to come,\nparticularly Mr. Stocks, and he wants to know if you have forgiven him.\nWhat can the boy mean?\"\n\nAs the cheerful little lady paused, Alice's heart beat till she feared\nbetrayal. A sudden fierce pleasure burned in her veins. Did he still\nseek her good opinion? Was he, as well as herself, miserable alone?\nAnd then came like a stab the thought that he had joined her with\nStocks. Did he class her with that alien world of prigs and dullards?\nShe ceased to think, and avoiding her hostess and tea, ran over the\nwooden bridge to the slope of hill and climbed up among the red heather.\n\nA month ago she had been heart-whole and young, a simple child. The\nsame prejudices and generous beliefs had been hers, but held loosely\nwith a child's comprehension. But now this old world had been awakened\nto arms against a dazzling new world of love and pleasure. She was led\ncaptive by emotion, but the cold rook of scruple remained. She had read\nof women surrendering all for love, but she felt dismally that this\nhappy gift had been denied her. Criticism, a fierce, vulgar antagonism,\nimpervious to sentiment, not to be exorcised by generous impulse--such\nwas her unlovely inheritance.\n\nAs she leaned over a pool of clear brown water in a little burn, where\nscented ferns dipped and great rocks of brake and heather shadowed, she\nsaw her face and figure mirrored in every colour and line. Her\nextraordinary prettiness delighted her, and then she laughed at her own\nvanity. A lady of the pools, with the dark eyes and red-gold hair of\nthe north, surely a creature of dawn and the blue sky, and born for no\ndreary self-communings. She returned, with her eyes clear and something\nlike laughter in her heart. To-morrow she should see him, to-morrow!\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nIt was the utter burning silence of midday, when the man who toils loses\nthe skin of his face, and the man who rests tastes the joys of deep\nleisure. The blue, airless sky, the level hilltops, the straight lines\nof glen, the treeless horizon of the moors--no sharp ridge or cliff\ncaught the tired eye, only an even, sleep-lulled harmony. Five very\nhungry, thirsty, and wearied men lay in the shadow above the Pool of\nNess, and prayed heaven for luncheon.\n\nLewis and George, Wratislaw and Arthur Mordaunt were there, and Doctor\nGracey, who loved a day on the hills. The keepers sat farther up the\nslope smoking their master's tobacco--sure sign of a well-spent morning.\nFor the party had been on the moors by eight, and for five burning hours\nhad tramped the heather. All wore light and airy shooting-clothes save\nthe doctor, who had merely buckled gaiters over his professional black\ntrousers. All were burned to a tawny brown, and all lay in different\nattitudes of gasping ease. Few things so clearly proclaim a man's past\nas his posture when lounging. Arthur and Wratislaw lay, like townsmen,\nprone on their faces with limbs rigidly straight. Lewis and George--old\ncampaigners both--lay a little on the side, arms lying loosely, and\nknees a little bent. But one and all gasped, and swore softly at the\nweather.\n\n\"Turn round, Tommy,\" said George, glancing up, \"or you'll get sunstroke\nat the back of the neck. I've had it twice, so I ought to know. You\nwant to wet your handkerchief and put it below your cap. Why don't you\nwear a deer-stalker instead of that hideous jockey thing? Feugh, I am\nwarm and cross and thirsty. Lewis, I'll give your aunt five minutes,\nand then I shall go down and drink that pool dry.\"\n\nLewis sat up and watched the narrow ribbon of road which coiled up the\nglen to the pool's edge. He only saw some hundreds of yards down it,\nbut the prospect served to convince him that his erratic aunt was late.\n\n\"If my wishes had any effect,\" said George, \"at this moment I should be\nhaving iced champagne.\" And he cast a longing eye to the hampers.\n\n\"You won't get any,\" said Lewis. \"We are not sybarites in this\nglen, and our drinks are the drinks of simple folk. Do you\nremember Cranstoun? I once went stalking with him, and we had\n_pate-de-foie-gras_ for luncheon away up on the side of a rugged\nmountain. That sort of thing sets my teeth on edge.\"\n\n\"Honest man!\" cried George. \"But here are your friends, and you had\nbetter stir yourself and make them welcome.\"\n\nFive very cool and leisurely beings were coming up the hill-path, for,\nhaving driven to above the village, they had had an easy walk of\nscarcely half a mile. Lewis's eye sought out a slight figure behind the\nothers, a mere gleam of pink and white. As she stepped out from the\npath to the heather his eye was quick to seize her exquisite grace.\nOther women arrayed themselves in loose and floating raiment, ribbons\nand what not; but here was one who knew her daintiness, and made no\neffort to cloak it. Trim, cool, and sweet, the coils of bright hair\nabove the white frock catching the noon sun--surely a lady to pray for\nand toil for, one made for no facile wooing or easy conquest.\n\nLewis advanced to Mr. Stocks as soon as he had welcomed his aunt, and\nshook hands cordially. \"We seem to have lost sight of each other during\nthe last few days. I never congratulated you enough, but you probably\nunderstood that my head was full of other things. You fought\nsplendidly, and I can't say I regret the issue. You will do much better\nthan I ever could.\"\n\nMr. Stocks smiled happily. The wheel of his fortunes was bringing him\nvery near the top. All the way up he had had Alice for a companion; and\nthat young woman, happy from a wholly different cause, had been\nwonderfully gracious. He felt himself on Mr. Lewis Haystoun's level at\nlast, and the baffling sense of being on a different plane, which he had\nalways experienced in his company, was gone, he hoped, for ever. So he\nbecame frank and confidential, forgot the pomp of his talk and his\ninevitable principles, and assisted in laying lunch.\n\nLady Manorwater drove her nephew into a corner.\n\n\"Where have you been, Lewis, all these days? If you had been anybody\nelse, I should have said you were sulking. I must speak to you\nseriously. Do you know that Alice has been breaking her heart for you?\nI won't have the poor child made miserable, and though I don't in the\nleast want you to marry her, yet; I cannot have you playing with her.\"\n\nLewis had grown suddenly very red.\n\n\"I think you are mistaken,\" he said stiffly. \"Miss Wishart does not\ncare a straw for me. If she is in love with anybody, it is with\nStocks.\"\n\n\"I am much older than you, my dear, and I should know better. I may as\nwell confess that I hoped it would be Mr. Stocks, but I can't\ndisbelieve my own eyes. The child becomes wretched whenever she hears\nyour name.\"\n\n\"You are making me miserably unhappy, because I can't believe a word of\nit. I have made a howling fool of myself lately, and I can't be blind\nto what she thinks of me.\"\n\nLady Manorwater looked pathetic. \"Is the great Lewis ashamed of\nhimself?\"\n\n\"Not a bit. I would do it again, for it is my nature to, as the hymn\nsays. I am cut all the wrong way, and my mind is my mind, you know.\nBut I can't expect Miss Wishart to take that point of view.\"\n\nHis aunt shook a hopeless head. \"Your moral nature is warped, my dear.\nIt has always been the same since you were a very small boy at\nGlenavelin, and read the Holy War on the hearthrug. You could never be\nmade to admire Emmanuel and his captains, but you set your heart on the\nreprobates Jolly and Griggish. But get away and look after your guests,\nsir.\"\n\nLunch came just in time to save five hungry men from an undignified end.\nThe Glenavelin party looked on with amusement as the ravenous appetites\nwere satisfied. Mr. Stocks, in a huge good humour, talked discursively\nof sport. He inquired concerning the morning's bag, and called up\nreminiscences of friends who had equalled or exceeded it. Lewis was\nuncomfortable, for he felt that in common civility Mr. Stocks should\nhave been asked to shoot. He could not excuse himself with the plea of\nan unintentional omission, for he had heard reports of the gentleman's\nwonderful awkwardness with a gun, and he had not found it in his heart\nto spoil the sport of five keen and competent hands.\n\nHe dared not look at Alice, for his aunt's words had set his pulses\nbeating hotly. For the last week he had wrestled with himself, telling\nhis heart that this lady was beyond his ken for ever and a day, for he\nbelonged by nature to the clan of despondent lovers. Before, she had\nhad all the icy reserve, he all the fervours. The hint of some spark of\nfire behind the snows of her demeanour filled him with a delirious joy.\nEvery movement of her body pleased him, every word which she spoke, the\nblitheness of her air and the ready kindness. The pale, pretty Afflint\ngirls, with their wit and their confidence, seemed old and womanly\ncompared with Alice. Let simplicity be his goddess\nhenceforth--simplicity and youth.\n\nThe Pool of Ness is a great, black cauldron of clear water, with berries\nabove and berries below, and high crags red with heather. There you may\nfind shade in summer, and great blaeberries and ripening rowans in the\nwane of August. These last were the snare for Alice, who was ever an\nadventurer. For the moment she was the schoolgirl again, and all sordid\nelderly cares were tossed to the wind. She teased Doctor Gracey to that\nworthy's delight, and she bade George and Arthur fetch and carry in a\nway that made them her slaves for life. Then she unbent to Mr. Stocks\nand made him follow her out on a peninsula of rock, above which hung a\ngreat cluster of fruit. The unfortunate politician was not built for\nthis kind of exercise, and slipped and clung despairingly to every root\nand cleft. Lewis followed aimlessly: her gaiety did not fit with his\nmood; and he longed to have her to himself and know his fortune.\n\nHe passed the panting Stocks and came up with the errant lady.\n\n\"For heaven's sake be careful, Miss Wishart,\" he cried in alarm.\n\"That's an ugly black swirl down there.\"\n\nThe girl laughed in his face.\n\n\"Isn't the place glorious!\" she cried. \"It's as cool as winter, and\noh! the colours of that hillside. I'm going up to that birk-tree to\nsit. Do you think I can do it?\"\n\n\"I am coming up after you,\" said Lewis.\n\nShe stopped and regarded it with serious eyes. \"It's hard, but I'm\ngoing to try. It's harder than the Midburn that I climbed up on the\nday I saw you fishing.\"\n\nShe remembered! Joy caught at his heart, and he laughed so gladly that\nAlice turned round to look at him. Something in his eyes made her turn\nher head away and scan the birk-tree again.\n\nThen suddenly there was a slip of soil, a helpless clutch at fern and\nheather, a cry of terror, and he was alone on the headland. The black\nswirl was closing over the girl's head.\n\nHe had been standing rapt in a happy fancy, his thoughts far in a world\nof their own, and his eyes vacant of any purpose. Startled to\nalertness, he still saw vaguely, and for a second stood irresolute and\nwondering. Then came another splash, and a heavy body flung itself into\nthe pool from lower down the rock. He knew the black head and the round\nshoulders of Mr. Stocks.\n\nThe man caught the girl as she struggled to get out of the swirl and\nwith strong ugly strokes began to make for shore. Lewis stood with a\nsick heart, slow to realize the horror which had overtaken him. She was\nout of danger, though the man was swimming badly; dismally he noted the\nfact of his atrocious swimming. But this was the hero; he had stood\nirresolute. The thought burned him like a hot iron.\n\nHalf a dozen pairs of hands relieved the swimmer of his burden. Alice\nwas little the worse, a trifle pale, very draggled and unhappy, and\nutterly tired. Lady Manorwater wept over her and kissed her, and hailed\nthe dripping Stocks as her preserver. Lewis alone stood back. He\nsatisfied himself that she was unhurt, and then, on the plea of getting\nthe carriage, set off down the glen with a very grey, quivering face.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTHE PLEASURES OF A CONSCIENCE\n\n\nIt was half-way down the glen that the full ignominy of his position\ncame on Lewis with the shock of a thunder-clap. A hateful bitterness\nagainst her preserver and the tricks of fate had been his solitary\nfeeling, till suddenly he realized the part he had played, and saw\nhimself for a naked coward. Coward he called himself--without\nreflection; for in such a moment the mind thinks in crude colours and\nbold lines of division. He set his teeth in his lip, and with a heart\nsinking at the shameful thought stalked into the farm stables where the\nGlenavelin servants were.\n\nHe could not return to the Pool. Alice was little hurt, so anxiety was\nneedless; better let him leave Mr. Stocks to enjoy his heroics in\npeace. He would find an excuse; meanwhile, give him quiet and solitude\nto digest his bitterness. He cursed himself for the unworthiness of his\nthoughts. What a pass had he come to when he grudged a little _kudos_\nto a rival, grudged it churlishly, childishly. He flung from him the\nself-reproach. Other people would wonder at his ungenerousness, and his\nsulky ill-nature. They would explain by the first easy discreditable\nreason. What cared he for their opinion when he knew the far greater\nshame in his heart?\n\nFor as he strode up the woodland path to Etterick the wrappings of\nsurface passion fell off from his view of the past hour, and he saw the\nbald and naked ribs of his own incapacity. It was a trivial incident to\nthe world, but to himself a momentous self-revelation. He was a\ndreamer, a weakling, a fool. He had hesitated in a crisis, and another\nhad taken his place. A thousand incidents of ready courage in past\nsport and travel were forgotten, and on this single slip the terrible\nindictment was founded. And the reason is at hand; this weakness had at\nlast drawn near to his life's great passion.\n\nHe found a deserted house, but its solitude was too noisy for his\nunrest. Bidding the butler tell his friends that he had gone up the\nhill, he crossed the sloping lawns and plunged into the thicket of\nrhododendrons. Soon he was out on the heather, with the great slopes,\nscorched with the heat, lying still and fragrant before him. He felt\nsick and tired, and flung himself down amid the soft brackens.\n\nIt was the man's first taste of bitter mental anguish. Hitherto his\nlife had been equable and pleasant; his friends had adored him; the\nworld had flattered him; he had been at peace with his own soul. He had\nknown his failings, but laughed at them cavalierly; he stood on a\ndifferent platform from the struggling, conscience-stricken herd. Now\nhe had in very truth been flung neck and crop from the pedestal of his\nself-esteem; and he lay groaning in the dust of abasement.\n\nWratislaw guessed with a friend's instinct his friend's disquietude, and\nturned his steps to the hill when he had heard the butler's message. He\nhad known something of Lewis's imaginary self-upbraidings, and he was\nprepared for them, but he was not prepared for the grey and wretched\nface in the lee of the pinewood. A sudden suspicion that Lewis had been\nguilty of some real dishonour flashed across his mind for the moment,\nonly to be driven out with scorn.\n\n\"Lewie, my son, what the deuce is wrong with you?\" he cried.\n\nThe other looked at him with miserable eyes.\n\n\"I am beginning to find out my rottenness.\"\n\nWratislaw laughed in spite of himself. \"What a fool to go making\npsychological discoveries on such a day! Is it all over the little\nmisfortune at the pool?\"\n\nTragedy grew in Lewis's eyes. \"Don't laugh, old chap. You don't know\nwhat I did. I let her fall into the water, and then I stood staring and\nlet another man--the other man--save her.\"\n\n\"Well, and what about that? He had a better chance than you. You\nshouldn't grudge him his good fortune.\"\n\n\"Good Lord, man, you don't think it's that that's troubling me! I felt\nmurderous, but it wasn't on his account.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" asked the older man drily. \"You love the girl, and he's in\nthe running with you. What more?\"\n\nLewis groaned. \"How can I talk about loving her when my love is such a\ntrifling thing that it doesn't nerve me to action? I tell you I love\nher body and soul. I live for her. The whole world is full of her.\nShe is never a second out of my thoughts. And yet I am so little of a\nman that I let her come near death and never try to save her.\"\n\n\"But, confound it, man, it may have been mere absence of mind. You were\nalways an extraordinarily plucky chap.\" Wratislaw spoke irritably, for\nit seemed to him sheer folly.\n\nLewis looked at him imploringly. \"Can you not understand?\" he cried.\n\nWratislaw did understand, and suddenly. The problem was subtler than he\nhad thought. Weakness was at the core of it, weakness revealed in\nself-deception and self-accusation alike, the weakness of the finical\ndreamer, the man with the unrobust conscience. But the weakness which\nLewis arraigned himself on was the very obvious failing of the diffident\nand the irresolute. Wratislaw tried the path of boisterous\nencouragement.\n\n\"Get up, you old fool, and come down to the house. You a coward! You\nare simply a romancer with an unfortunate knack of tragedy.\" The man\nmust be laughed out of this folly. If he were not he would show the\nself-accusing front to the world, and the Manorwaters, Alice,\nStocks--all save his chosen intimates--would credit him with a cowardice\nof which he had no taint.\n\nArthur and George, resigned now to the inevitable lady, had seen in the\nincident only the anxiety of a man for his beloved, and just a hint of\nthe ungenerous in his treatment of Mr. Stocks. They were not prepared\nfor the silent tragic figure which Wratislaw brought with him.\n\nArthur had a glint of the truth, but the obtuse George saw nothing. \"Do\nyou know that you are going to have the Wisharts for neighbours for a\ncouple of months yet? Old Wishart has taken Glenavelin from the end of\nAugust.\"\n\nThis would have been pleasant hearing at another time, but now it simply\ndrove home the nail of his bitter reflections. Alice would be near him,\na terrible reproach--she, the devotee of strength and competence. He\ncould not win her, and it is characteristic of the man that he had\nceased to think of Mr. Stocks as his rival. He would lose her to no\nrival; to his ragged incapacity alone would his ill fortune be due.\n\nHe struggled to act the part of the cheerful host, and Wratislaw watched\nhis efforts grimly. He ate little at dinner, showed no desire to smoke,\nand played billiards so badly that Wratislaw, an execrable player, won\nthe first and last game of his life. The victor took him out of doors\nthereafter to walk on the moonlit, fragrant lawn.\n\n\"You are taking things to heart,\" said he.\n\n\"And I'm blessed if I can understand you. To me it's sheer mania.\"\n\n\"And to me it's the last link in a chain. I have suspected myself for\nlong, now I know myself and--ugh! the knowledge is a hideous thing.\"\n\nWratislaw stood regarding his companion seriously. \"I wonder what will\nhappen to you, Lewie. Life is serious enough without inventing a\ncrotchety virtue to make it miserable.\"\n\n\"Can't you understand me, Tommy? It isn't that I'm a cad, it's that I\nam a coward. I couldn't be a cad supposing I tried. These things are a\nmatter chiefly of blood and bone, and I am not made that way. But God\nhelp me! I am a coward. I can't fight worth twopence. Look at my\nperformance a fortnight ago. The ordinary gardener's boy can beat me at\nmaking love. I am full of generous impulses and sentiments, but what's\nthe use of them? Everything grows cold and I am a dumb icicle when it\ncomes to action. I knew all this before, but I thought I had kept my\nbodily courage. I've had a good enough training, and I used to have\npluck.\"\n\n\"But you don't mean to tell me that it was funk that kept you out of the\npool to-day?\" cried the impatient Wratislaw.\n\n\"How do I know that it wasn't?\" came the wretched answer.\n\nWratislaw turned on his heel and made to go back.\n\n\"You're an infernal idiot, Lewie, and an infernal child. Thank heaven!\nyour friends know you better than you know yourself.\"\n\nThe next morning it was a different man who came down to breakfast. He\nhad lost his haggard air, and seemed to have forgotten the night's\nepisode.\n\n\"Was I very rude to everybody last night?\" he asked. \"I have a vague\nrecollection of playing the fool.\"\n\n\"You were particularly rude about yourself,\" said Wratislaw.\n\nThe young man laughed. \"It's a way I have sometimes. It's an awkward\nthing when a man's foes are of his own household.\"\n\nThe others seemed to see a catch in his mirth, a ring as of something\nhollow. He opened some letters, and looked up from one with a twitching\nface and a curious droop of the eyelids. \"Miss Wishart is all right,\"\nhe said. \"My aunt says that she is none the worse, but that Stocks has\ncaught a tremendous cold. An unromantic ending!\"\n\nThe meal ended, they wandered out to the lawn to smoke, and Wratislaw\nfound himself standing with a hand on his host's shoulder. He noticed\nsomething distraught in his glance and air.\n\n\"Are you fit again to-day?\" he asked.\n\n\"Quite fit, thanks,\" said Lewis, but his face belied him. He had\nforgiven himself the incident of yesterday, but no proof of a non\nsequitur could make him relinquish his dismal verdict. The wide morning\nlandscape lay green and soothing at his feet. Down in the glen men were\nwinning the bog-hay; up on the hill slopes they were driving lambs; the\nAvelin hurried to the Gled, and beyond was the great ocean and the\ninfinite works of man. The whole brave bustling world was astir, little\nand great ships hasting out of port, the soldier scaling the breach, the\nadventurer travelling the deserts. And he, the fool, had no share in\nthis braggart heritage. He could not dare to look a man straight in the\nface, for like the king in the old fable he had lost his soul.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nA GENTLEMAN IN STRAITS\n\n\nThe fall of the leaf found Etterick very full of people, and new\ndwellers in Glenavelin. The invitations were of old standing, but Lewis\nfound their fulfilment a pleasant trick of Fortune's. To keep a\nbustling household in good spirits leaves small room for brooding, and\nhe was famous for his hospitality. The partridges were plentiful that\nyear, and a rainless autumn had come on the heels of a fine summer. So\nlife went pleasantly with all, and the master of the place cloaked a\nvery sick heart under a ready good-humour.\n\nHis thoughts were always on Glenavelin, and when he happened to be near\nit he used to look with anxious eyes for a slim figure which was rarely\nout of his fancy. He had not seen Alice since the accident, save for\none short minute, when riding from Gledsmuir he had passed her one\nafternoon at the Glenavelin gates. He had earnestly desired to stop,\nbut his curious cowardice had made him pass with a lifted hat and a\nhasty smile. Could he have looked back, he might have seen the girl\nwatching him out of sight with tearful eyes. To himself he was the\nhopeless lover, and she the scornful lady, while she in her own eyes was\nthe unhappy girl for whom the soldier in the song shakes his bridle\nreins and cries an eternal adieu.\n\nMatters did not improve when the Manorwaters left and Mr. Wishart\nhimself came down, bringing with him Stocks, a certain Mr. Andrews and\nhis wife, and an excellent young man called Thompson. All were pleasant\npeople, with the manners which the world calls hearty, well-groomed,\npresentable folk, who enjoyed this life and looked forward to a better.\n\nMr. Wishart explored the place thoroughly the first evening, and\nexplained that he was thankful indeed that he had been led to take it.\nHe was a handsome man with a worn, elderly face, a square jaw and\nsomewhat weary eyes. It is given to few men to make a great fortune and\nnot bear the signs of it on their persons.\n\n\"I expect you enjoyed staying with Lady Manorwater, Alice?\" Mrs.\nAndrews declared at dinner. \"They are very plain people, aren't they,\nto be such great aristocrats?\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said the girl listlessly.\n\n\"I once met Lady Manorwater at Mrs. Cookson's at afternoon tea. I\nthought she was badly dressed. You know Manorwater, don't you, George?\"\nsaid the lady to her husband, with the boldness which comes from the use\nof a peer's name without the handle.\n\n\"Oh yes, I know him well. I have met him at the Liberal Club dinners,\nand I was his chairman once when he spoke on Irish affairs. A\ndelightful man!\"\n\n\"I suppose they would have a pleasant house-party when you were here, my\ndear?\" asked the lady. \"And of course you had the election. What fun!\nAnd what a victory for you, Mr. Stocks! I hear you beat the greatest\nlandowner in the district.\"\n\nMr. Stocks smiled and glanced at Alice. The girl flushed; she could\nnot help it; and she hated Mr. Stocks for his look.\n\nHer father spoke for the first time. \"What is the young man like, Mr.\nStocks? I hear he is very proud and foolish, the sort of over-educated\ntype which the world has no use for.\"\n\n\"I like him,\" said Mr. Stocks dishonestly. \"He fought like a\ngentleman.\"\n\n\"These people are so rarely gentlemen,\" said Mrs. Andrews, proud of her\nhigh attitude. \"I suppose his father made his money in coal and bought\nthe land from some poor dear old aristocrat. It is so sad to think of\nit. And that sort of person is always over-educated, for you see they\nhave not the spirit of the old families and they bury themselves in\nbooks.\" Mrs. Andrews's father had kept a crockery shop, but his\ndaughter had buried the memory.\n\nMr. Wishart frowned. The lady had been asked down for her husband's\nsake, and he did not approve of this chatter about family. Mr. Stocks,\nwho was about to explain the Haystoun pedigree, caught his host's eye\nand left the dangerous subject untouched.\n\n\"You said in your letters that they had been kind to you at this young\nman's place. We must ask him down here to dinner, Alice. Oh, and that\nreminds me I found a letter from him to-day asking me to shoot. I don't\ngo in for that sort of thing, but you young fellows had better try it.\"\n\nMr. Stocks declined, said he had given it up. Mr. Thompson said,\n\"Upon my word I should like to,\" and privately vowed to forget the\ninvitation. He distrusted his prowess with a gun.\n\n\"By the by, was he not at the picnic when you saved my daughter's life?\nI can never thank you enough, Stocks. What should I have done without\nmy small girl?\"\n\n\"Yes, he was there. In fact he was with Miss Alice at the moment she\nslipped.\"\n\nHe may not have meant it, but the imputation was clear, and it stirred\none fiery expostulation. \"Oh, but he hadn't time before Mr. Stocks\ncame after me,\" she began, and then feeling it ungracious towards that\ngentleman to make him share a possibility of heroism with another, she\nwas silent. More, a lurking fear which had never grown large enough for\na suspicion, began to catch at her heart. Was it possible that Lewis\nhad held back?\n\nFor a moment the candle-lit room vanished from her eyes. She saw the\nwarm ledge of rock with the rowan berries above. She saw his flushed,\neager face--it was her last memory before she had fallen. Surely\nnever--never was there cowardice in those eyes!\n\nMrs. Andrews's vulgarities and her husband's vain repetitions began to\npall upon the anxious girl. The young Mr. Thompson talked shrewdly\nenough on things of business, and Mr. Stocks abated something of his\npomposity and was honestly amiable. These were her own people, the\nworkers for whom she had craved. And yet--were they so desirable? Her\nfather's grave, keen face pleased her always, but what of the others?\nThe radiant gentlewomen whom she had met with the Manorwaters seemed to\nbelong to another world than this of petty social struggling and awkward\nostentation. And the men! Doubtless they were foolish, dilettanti,\nbarbarians of sport, half-hearted and unpractical! And she shut her\nheart to any voice which would defend them.\n\nLewis drove over to dine some four days later with dismal presentiments.\nThe same hopeless self-contempt which had hung over him for weeks was\nstill weighing on his soul. He dreaded the verdict of Alice's eyes, and\nin a heart which held only kindness he looked for a cold criticism. It\nwas this despair which made his position hopeless. He would never take\nhis chance; there could be no opportunity for the truth to become clear\nto both; for in his plate-armour of despair he was shielded against the\nworld. Such was his condition to the eyes of a friend; to himself he\nwas the common hopeless lover who sighed for a stony mistress.\n\nHe noticed changes in Glenavelin. Businesslike leather pouches stood in\nthe hall, and an unwontedly large pile of letters lay on a table. The\ndrawing-room was the same as ever, but in the dining-room an escritoire\nhad been established which groaned under a burden of papers. Mr.\nWishart puzzled and repelled him. It was a strong face, but a cold and\na stupid one, and his eyes had the glassy hardness of the man without\nvision. He was bidden welcome, and thanked in a tactless way for his\nkindness to Mr. Wishart's daughter. Then he was presented to Mrs.\nAndrews, and his courage sank as he bowed to her.\n\nAt table the lady twitted him with graceful badinage. \"Alice and you\nmust have had a gay time, Mr. Haystoun. Why, you've been seeing each\nother constantly for months. Have you become great friends?\" She\nexerted herself, for, though he might be a parvenu, he was undeniably\nhandsome.\n\nMr. Stocks explained that Mr. Haystoun had organized wonderful picnic\nparties. The lady clapped her many-ringed hands, and declared that he\nmust repeat the experiment. \"For I love picnics,\" she said, \"I love the\nsimplicity and the fresh air and the rippling streams. And washing up\nis fun, and it is such a great chance for you young men.\" And she cast a\ncoy glance over her shoulder.\n\n\"Do you live far off, Mr. Haystoun?\" she asked repeatedly. \"Four\nmiles? Oh, that's next door. We shall come and see you some day. We\nhave just been staying with the Marshams--Mr. Marsham, you know, the\nbig cotton people. Very vulgar, but the house is charming. It was so\nexciting, for the elections were on, and the Hestons, who are the great\npeople in that part of the country, were always calling. Dear Lady\nJulia is so clever. Did you ever meet Mr. Marsham, by any chance?\"\n\n\"Not that I remember. I know the Hestons of course. Julia is my\ncousin.\"\n\nThe lady was silenced. \"But I thought,\" she murmured. \"I thought--they\nwere--\" She broke off with a cough.\n\n\"Yes, I spent a good many of my school holidays at Heston.\"\n\nAlice broke in with a question about the Manorwaters. The youthful Mr.\nThompson, who, apart from his solicitor's profession, was a devotee of\ncricket, asked in a lofty way if Mr. Haystoun cared for the game.\n\n\"I do rather. I'm not very good, but we raised an eleven this year in\nthe glen which beat Gledsmuir.\"\n\nThe notion pleased the gentleman. If a second match could be arranged\nhe might play and show his prowess. In all likelihood this solemn and\nbookish laird, presumably brought up at home, would be a poor enough\nplayer.\n\n\"I played a lot at school,\" he said. \"In fact I was in the Eleven for\ntwo years and I played in the Authentics match, and once against the\nEton Ramblers. A strong lot they were.\"\n\n\"Let me see. Was that about seven years ago? I seem to remember.\"\n\n\"Seven years ago,\" said Mr. Thompson. \"But why? Did you see the\nmatch?\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't in the match; I had twisted my ankle, jumping. But I\ncaptained the Ramblers that season, so I remember it.\"\n\nRespect grew large in Mr. Thompson's eyes. Here were modesty and\ndistinction equally mated. The picture of the shy student had gone from\nhis memory.\n\n\"If you like to come up to Etterick we might get up a match from the\nvillage,\" said Lewis courteously. \"Ourselves with the foresters and\nkeepers against the villagers wouldn't be a bad arrangement.\"\n\nTo Alice the whole conversation struck a jarring note. His eye kindled\nand he talked freely on sport. Was it not but a new token of his\nincurable levity? Mr. Wishart, who had understood little of the talk,\nfound in this young man strange stuff to shape to a politician's ends.\nContrasted with the gravity of Mr. Stocks, it was a schoolboy beside a\nmaster.\n\n\"I have been reading,\" he said slowly, \"reading a speech of the new\nUnder-Secretary for Foreign Affairs. I cannot understand the temper of\nmind which it illustrates. He talks of the Bosnian war, and a brave\npeople struggling for freedom, as if it were merely a move in some\nhideous diplomatists' game. A man of that sort cannot understand a\nmoral purpose.\"\n\n\"Tommy--I mean to say Mr. Wratislaw--doesn't believe in Bosnian\nfreedom, but you know he is a most ardent moralist.\"\n\n\"I do not understand,\" said Mr. Wishart drily.\n\n\"I mean that personally he is a Puritan, a man who tries every action of\nhis life by a moral standard. But he believes that moral standards vary\nwith circumstances.\"\n\n\"Pernicious stuff, sir. There is one moral law. There is one Table of\nCommandments.\"\n\n\"But surely you must translate the Commandments into the language of the\noccasion. You do not believe that 'Thou shalt not kill' is absolute in\nevery case?\"\n\n\"I mean that except in the God-appointed necessity of war, and in the\nserving of criminal justice, killing is murder.\"\n\n\"Suppose a man goes travelling,\" said Lewis with abstracted eyes, \"and\nhas a lot of native servants. They mutiny, and he shoots down one or\ntwo. He saves his life, he serves, probably, the ends of civilization.\nDo you call that murder?\"\n\n\"Assuredly. Better, far better that he should perish in the wilderness\nthan that he should take the law into his own hands and kill one of\nGod's creatures.\"\n\n\"But law, you know, is not an absolute word.\"\n\nMr. Wishart scented danger. \"I can't argue against your subtleties,\nbut my mind is clear; and I can respect no man who could think\notherwise.\"\n\nLewis reddened and looked appealingly at Alice. She, too, was\nuncomfortable. Her opinions sounded less convincing when stated\ndogmatically by her father.\n\nMr. Stocks saw his chance and took it.\n\n\"Did you ever happen to be in such a crisis as you speak of, Mr.\nHaystoun? You have travelled a great deal.\"\n\n\"I have never had occasion to put a man to death,\" said Lewis, seeing\nthe snare and scorning to avoid it.\n\n\"But you have had difficulties?\"\n\n\"Once I had to flog a couple of men. It was not pleasant, and worst of\nall it did no good.\"\n\n\"Irrational violence seldom does,\" grunted Mr. Wishart.\n\n\"No, for, as I was going to say, it was a clear case where the men\nshould have been put to death. They had deserved it, for they had\ndisobeyed me, and by their disobedience caused the death of several\ninnocent people. They decamped shortly afterwards, and all but managed\nto block our path. I blame myself still for not hanging them.\"\n\nA deep silence hung over the table. Mr. Wishart and the Andrews stared\nwith uncomprehending faces. Mr. Stocks studied his plate, and Alice\nlooked on the speaker with eyes in which unwilling respect strove with\nconsternation.\n\nOnly the culprit was at his ease. The discomfort of these good people\nfor a moment amused him. Then the sight of Alice's face, which he\nwholly misread, brought him back to decent manners.\n\n\"I am afraid I have shocked you,\" he said simply. \"If one knocks about\nthe world one gets a different point of view.\"\n\nMr. Wishart restrained a flood of indignation with an effort. \"We\nwon't speak on the subject,\" he said. \"I confess I have my prejudices.\"\n\nMr. Stocks assented with a smile and a sigh. In the drawing-room\nafterwards Lewis was presented with the olive-branch of peace. He had\nto attend Mrs. Andrews to the piano and listen to her singing of a\nsentimental ballad with the face of a man in the process of enjoyment.\nSoon he pleaded the four miles of distance and the dark night, and took\nhis leave. His spirits had in a measure returned. Alice had not been\ngracious, but she had shown no scorn. And her spell at the first sight\nof her was woven a thousand-fold over his heart.\n\nHe found her alone for one moment in the hall.\n\n\"Alice--Miss Wishart, may I come and see you? It is a pity such near\nneighbours should see so little of each other.\"\n\nHis hesitation made him cloak a despairing request in the garb of a\nconventional farewell.\n\nThe girl had the sense to pierce the disguise. \"You may come and see\nus, if you like, Mr. Haystoun. We shall be at home all next week.\"\n\n\"I shall come very soon,\" he cried, and he was whirled away from the\nlight; with the girl's face framed in the arch of the doorway making a\npicture for his memory.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen the others had gone to bed, Stocks and Mr. Wishart sat up over a\nlast pipe by the smoking-room fire.\n\nThe younger man moved uneasily in his chair. He had something to say\nwhich had long lain on his mind, and he was uncertain of its reception.\n\n\"You have been for a long time my friend, Mr. Wishart,\" he began. \"You\nhave done me a thousand kindnesses, and I only hope I have not proved\nmyself unworthy of them.\"\n\nMr. Wishart raised his eyebrows at the peculiar words. \"Certainly you\nhave not,\" he said. \"I regard you as the most promising by far of the\nyounger men of my acquaintance, and any little services I may have\nrendered have been amply repaid me.\"\n\nThe younger man bowed and looked into the fire.\n\n\"It is very kind of you to speak so,\" he said. \"I have been wondering\nwhether I might not ask for a further kindness, the greatest favour\nwhich you could confer upon me. Have you made any plans for your\ndaughter's future?\"\n\nMr. Wishart sat up stiffly on the instant. \"You mean?\" he said.\n\n\"I mean that I love Alice ... your daughter ... and I wish to make\nher my wife. If you will give me your consent, I will ask her.\"\n\n\"But--but,\" said the old man, stammering. \"Does the girl know anything\nof this?\"\n\n\"She knows that I love her, and I think she will not be unkind.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I object,\" said Mr. Wishart after a long pause. \"In\nfact I am very willing, and I am very glad that you had the good manners\nto speak to me first. Yes, upon my word, sir, I am pleased. You have\nhad a creditable career, and your future promises well. My girl will\nhelp you, for though I say it, she will not be ill-provided for. I\nrespect your character and I admire your principles, and I give you my\nheartiest good wishes.\"\n\nMr. Stocks rose and held out his hand. He felt that the interview\ncould not be prolonged in the present fervour of gratitude.\n\n\"Had it been that young Haystoun now,\" said Mr. Wishart, \"I should\nnever have given my consent. I resolved long ago that my daughter\nshould never marry an idle man. I am a plain man, and I care nothing\nfor social distinctions.\"\n\nBut as Mr. Stocks left the room the plain man glanced after him, and\nsitting back suffered a moment's reflection. The form of this worker\ncontrasted in his mind with the figure of the idler who had that evening\ngraced his table. A fool, doubtless, but a fool with an air and a\nmanner! And for one second he allowed himself to regret that he was to\nacquire so unromantic a son-in-law.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHE NEMESIS OF A COWARD\n\n\nTwo days later the Andrews drove up the glen to Etterick, taking with\nthem the unwilling Mr. Wishart. Alice had escaped the ordeal with some\nfeigned excuse, and the unfortunate Mr. Thompson, deeply grieving, had\nbeen summoned by telegram from cricket to law. The lady had chattered\nall the way up the winding moorland road, crying out banalities about\nthe pretty landscape, or questioning her very ignorant companions about\nthe dwellers in Etterick. She was full of praises for the house when it\ncame in view; it was \"quaint,\" it was \"charming,\" it was everything\ninappropriate. But the amiable woman's prattle deserted her when she\nfound herself in the cold stone hall with the great portraits and the\nlack of all modern frippery. It was so plainly a man's house, so\nclearly a place of tradition, that her pert modern speech seemed for one\nmoment a fatuity.\n\nIt was an off-day for the shooters, and so for a miracle there were men\nin the drawing-room at tea-time. The hostess for the time was an aunt\nof Lewis's, a certain Mrs. Alderson, whose husband (the famous big-game\nhunter) had but recently returned from the jaws of a Zambesi lion.\nGeorge's sister, Lady Clanroyden, a tall, handsome girl in a white\nfrock, was arranging flowers in a bowl, and on the sill of the open\nwindow two men were basking in the sun. From the inner drawing-room\nthere came an echo of voices and laughter. The whole scene was sunny\nand cheerful, youth and age, gay frocks and pleasant faces amid the old\ntapestry and mahogany of a moorland house.\n\nMr. Andrews sat down solemnly to talk of the weather with the two men,\nwho found him a little dismal. One--he of the Zambesi lion episode--was\ngrizzled, phlegmatic, and patient, and in no way critical of his\ncompany. So soon he was embarked on extracts from his own experience to\nwhich Mr. Andrews, who had shares in some company in the neighbourhood,\nlistened with flattering attention. Mrs. Alderson set herself to\nentertain Mr. Wishart, and being a kindly, simple person, found the\ntask easy. They were soon engaged in an earnest discussion of\nunsectarian charities.\n\nLady Clanroyden, with an unwilling sense of duty, devoted herself to\nMrs. Andrews. That simpering matron fell into a vein of confidences\nand in five brief minutes had laid bare her heart. Then came the\nnarrative of her recent visit to the Marshams, and the inevitable\nmention of the Hestons.\n\n\"Oh, you know the Hestons?\" said Lady Clanroyden, brightening.\n\n\"Very well indeed.\" The lady smiled, looking round to make sure that\nLewis was not in the room.\n\n\"Julia is here, you know. Julia, come and speak to your friends.\"\n\nA dark girl in mourning came forward to meet the expansive smile of Mrs.\nAndrews. Earnestly the lady hoped that she remembered the single brief\nmeeting on which she had built a fictitious acquaintance, and was\nreassured when the newcomer shook hands with her pleasantly. Truth to\ntell, Lady Julia had no remembrance of her face, but was too\ngood-natured to be honest.\n\n\"And how is your dear mother? I was so sorry to hear from a mutual\nfriend that she had been unwell.\" How thankful she was that she read\neach week various papers which reported people's doings!\n\nA sense of bewilderment lurked in her heart. Who was this Lewis\nHaystoun who owned such a house and such a kindred? The hypothesis of\nmoney made in coal seemed insufficient, and with much curiosity she set\nherself to solve the problem.\n\n\"Is Mr. Haystoun coming back to tea?\" she asked by way of a preface.\n\n\"No, he has had to go to Gledsmuir. We are all idle this afternoon, but\nhe has a landowner's responsibilities.\"\n\n\"Have his family been here long? I seem never to have heard the name.\"\n\nLady Clanroyden looked a little surprised. \"Yes, they have been rather\na while. I forget how many centuries, but a good many. It was about\nthis place, you know, that the old ballad of 'The Riding of Etterick'\nwas made, and a Haystoun was the hero.\"\n\nMrs. Andrews knew nothing about old ballads, but she feigned a happy\nreminiscence.\n\n\"It is so sad his being beaten by Mr. Stocks,\" she declared. \"Of\ncourse an old county family should provide the members for a district.\nThey have the hearts of the people with them.\"\n\n\"Then the hearts of the people have a funny way of revealing\nthemselves,\" Lady Clanroyden laughed. \"I'm not at all sorry that Lewie\nwas beaten. He is the best man in the world, but one wants to shake him\nup. His motto is 'Thole,' and he gets too few opportunities of\n'tholing.'\"\n\n\"You all call him 'Lewie,'\" commented the lady. \"How popular he must\nbe!\"\n\nMabel Clanroyden laughed. \"I have known him ever since I was a small\ngirl in a short frock and straight-brushed hair. He was never anything\nelse than Lewie to his friends. Oh, here is my wandering brother and my\nonly son returned,\" and she rose to catch up a small, self-possessed boy\nof some six years, who led the flushed and reluctant George in tow.\n\nThe small boy was very dirty, ruddy and cheerful. He had torn his\nblouse, and scratched his brow, and the crown of his straw hat had\nparted company with the brim.\n\n\"George,\" said his sister severely, \"have you been corrupting the\nmanners of my son? Where have you been?\"\n\nThe boy--he rejoiced in the sounding name of Archibald--slapped a small\nleg with a miniature whip, and counterfeited with great skill the pose\nof the stable-yard. He slowly unclenched a smutty fist and revealed\nthree separate shillings.\n\n\"I won um myself,\" he explained.\n\n\"Is it highway robbery?\" asked his mother with horrified eyes.\n\"Archibald, have you stopped a coach, or held up a bus or anything of\nthe kind?\"\n\nThe child unclenched his hand again, beamed on his prize, smiled\nknowingly at the world, and shut it.\n\n\"What has the dreadful boy been after? Oh, tell me, George, please. I\nwill try to bear it.\"\n\n\"We fell in with a Sunday-school picnic along in the glen, and Archie\nmade me take him there. And he had tea--I hope the little chap won't be\nill, by the by. And he made a speech or a recitation or something of\nthe sort. Nobody understood it, but it went down like anything.\"\n\n\"And do you mean to say that the people gave him money, and you allowed\nhim to take it?\" asked an outraged mother.\n\n\"He won it,\" said George. \"Won it in fair fight. He was second in the\nrace under twelve, and first in the race under ten. They gave him a\ndecent handicap, and he simply romped home. That chap can run, Mabel.\nHe tried the sack race, too, but the first time he slipped altogether\ninside the thing and had to be taken out, yelling. But he stuck to it\nlike a Trojan, and at the second shot he got started all right, and\nwould have won it if he hadn't lost his head and rolled down a bank. He\nisn't scratched much, considering he fell among whins. That also\nexplains the state of his hat.\"\n\n\"George, you shall never, never, as long as I live, take my son out with\nyou again. It is a wonder the poor child escaped with his life. You\nhave not a scrap of feeling. I must take the boy away or he will shame\nme before everybody. Come and talk to Mrs. Andrews, George. May I\nintroduce my brother, Mr. Winterham?\"\n\nGeorge, who wanted to smoke, sat down unwillingly in the chair which his\nsister had left. The lady, whose airs and graces were all for men, put\non her most bewitching manner.\n\n\"Your sister and I have just been talking about this exquisite place,\nMr. Winterham. It must be delightful to live in such a centre of old\nromance. That lovely 'Riding of Etterick' has been running in my head\nall the way up.\"\n\nGeorge privately wondered at the confession. The peculiarly tragic and\nghastly fragments which made up \"The Riding of Etterick,\" seemed\nscarcely suited to haunt a lady's memory.\n\n\"Had you a long drive?\" he asked in despair for a topic.\n\n\"Only from Glenavelin.\"\n\nHe awoke to interest. \"Are you staying at Glenavelin just now? The\nWisharts are in it, are they not? We were a great deal about the place\nwhen the Manorwaters were there.\"\n\n\"Oh yes. I have heard about Lady Manorwater from Alice Wishart. She\nmust be a charming woman; Alice cannot speak enough about her.\"\n\nGeorge's face brightened. \"Miss Wishart is a great friend of mine, and\na most awfully good sort.\"\n\n\"And as you are a great friend of hers I think I may tell you a great\nsecret,\" and the lady patted him playfully. \"Our pretty Alice is going\nto be married.\"\n\nGeorge was thoroughly roused to attention. \"Who is the man?\" he asked\nsharply.\n\n\"I think I may tell you,\" said Mrs. Andrews, enjoying her sense of\nimportance. \"It is Mr. Stocks, the new member.\"\n\nGeorge restrained with difficulty a very natural oath. Then he looked\nat his informant and saw in her face only silliness and truth. For the\ngood woman had indeed persuaded herself of the verity of her fancy. Mr.\nStocks had told her that he had her father's consent and good wishes,\nand misinterpreting the girl's manner she had considered the affair\nsettled.\n\nIt was unfortunate that Mr. Wishart at this moment showed such obvious\nsigns of restlessness that the lady rose to take her leave, otherwise\nGeorge might have learned the truth. After the Glenavelin party had\ngone he wandered out to the lawn, pulling his moustache in vast\nperplexity and cursing the twisted world. He had no guess at Lewis's\nmanner of wooing; to him it had seemed the simple, straightforward love\nwhich he thought beyond resistance. And now, when he learned of this\nmelancholy issue, he was sore at heart for his friend.\n\nHe was awakened from his reverie by Lewis himself, who, having ridden\nstraight to the stables, was now sauntering towards the house. A trim\nman looks at his best in riding clothes, and Lewis was no exception. He\nwas flushed with sun and motion, his spirits were high, for all the\njourney he had been dreaming of a coming meeting with Alice, and the\nhope which had suddenly increased a thousand-fold. George marked his\nmood, and with a regret at his new role caught him by the arm and\nchecked him.\n\n\"I say, old man, don't go in just yet. I want to tell you something,\nand I think you had better hear it now.\"\n\nLewis turned obediently, amazed by the gravity of his friend's face.\n\n\"Some people came up from Glenavelin this afternoon and among them a\nMrs. Andrews, whom I had a talk to. She told me that Al--Miss Wishart\nis engaged to that fellow Stocks.\"\n\nLewis's face whitened and he turned away his eyes. He could not credit\nit. Two days ago she had been free; he could swear it; he remembered\nher eyes at parting. Then came the thought of his blindness, and in a\ngreat horror of self-mistrust he seemed to see throughout it all his\ncriminal folly. He, poor fool, had been pleasing himself with dreams of\na meeting, when all the while the other man had been the real lover.\nShe had despised him, spared not a thought for him save as a pleasing\nidler; and he--that he should ever have ventured for one second to hope!\nCuriously enough, for the first time he thought of Stocks with respect;\nto have won the girl seemed in itself the proof of dignity and worth.\n\n\"Thanks very much for telling me. I am glad I know. No, I don't think\nI'll go into the house yet.\"\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe days passed and Alice waited with anxious heart for the coming of\nthe very laggard Lewis. To-day he will come, she said each morning; and\nevening found her--poor heart!--still expectant. She told herself a\nthousand times that it was sheer folly. He meant nothing, it was a mere\nfashion of speech; and then her heart would revolt and bid common sense\nbe silent. He came indeed with some of the Etterick party on a formal\ncall, but this was clearly not the fulfilment of his promise. So the\ngirl waited and despaired, while the truant at Etterick was breaking his\nheart for the unattainable.\n\nMr. Stocks, having won the official consent, conducted his suit with\ncommendable discretion. Suit is the word for the performance, so full\nwas it of elaborate punctilios. He never intruded upon her unhappiness.\nA studied courtesy, a distant thoughtfulness were his only compliments.\nBut when he found her gayer, then would he strive with subtle delicacies\nof manner to make clear the part he desired to play.\n\nThe girl saw his kindness and was grateful. In the revulsion against\nthe Andrews he seemed a link with the more pleasant sides of life, and\nsoon in her despair and anger his modest merits took heroic proportions\nin her eyes. She forgot her past dislike; she thought only of this, the\nsimple good man, contrasted with the showy and fickle-hearted--true\nmetal against glittering tinsel. His very weaknesses seemed homely and\nvenial. He was of her own world, akin to the things which deep down in\nher soul she knew she must love to the last. It is to the credit of the\nman's insight that he saw the mood and took pains to foster it.\n\nTwice he asked her to marry him. The first time her heart was still\nsore with disappointment and she refused--yet half-heartedly.\n\nHe waited his time and when the natural cheerfulness of her temper was\nbeginning to rise, he again tried his fortune.\n\n\"I cannot,\" she cried. \"I cannot. I like you very much, but oh, it is\ntoo much to ask me to marry you.\"\n\n\"But I love you with all my heart, Alice.\" And the honesty of his tone\nand the distant thought of a very different hope brought the tears to\nher eyes.\n\nHe had forgotten all pompous dreams and the stilted prospects with which\nhe had aforetime hoped to beguile his wife. The man was plain and\nsimple now, a being very much on fire with an honest passion. He may\nhave left her love-cold, but he touched the sympathy which in a true\nwoman is love's nearest neighbour. Before she knew herself she had\npromised, and had been kissed respectfully and tenderly by her delighted\nlover. For a moment she felt something like joy, and then, with a\ndreadful thought of the baselessness of her pleasure, walked slowly\nhomewards by his side.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe next morning Alice rose with a dreary sense of the irrevocable. A\ndoor seemed to have closed behind her, and the future stretched before\nher in a straight dusty path with few nooks and shadows. This was not\nthe blithe morning of betrothal she had looked for. The rapturous\noutlook on life which she had dreamed of was replaced by a cold and\nbusiness-like calculation of profits. The rose garden of the \"god\nunconquered in battle\" was exchanged for a very shoddy and huckstering\nparadise.\n\nMrs. Andrews claimed her company all the morning, and with the\npertinacity of her kind soon guessed the very obvious secret. Her\ngushing congratulations drove the girl distracted. She praised the good\nStocks, and Alice drank in the comfort of such words with greedy ears.\nFrom one young man she passed to another, and hung lovingly over the\nperfections of Mr. Haystoun. \"He has the real distinction, dear,\" she\ncried, \"which you can never mistake. It only belongs to old blood and\nit is quite inimitable. His friends are so charming, too, and you can\nalways tell a man by his people. It is so pleasant to fall in with old\nacquaintances again. That dear Lady Clanroyden promised to come over\nsoon. I quite long to see her, for I feel as if I had known her for\nages.\"\n\nAfter lunch Alice fled the house and sought her old refuge--the hills.\nThere she would find the deep solitude for thought. She was not\nbroken-hearted, though she grieved now and again with a blind longing of\nregret. But she was confused and shaken; the landmarks of her vision\nseemed to have been removed, and she had to face the grim narrowing-down\nof hopes which is the sternest trial for poor mortality.\n\nAutumn's hand was lying heavy on the hillsides. Bracken was yellowing,\nheather passing from bloom, and the clumps of wild-wood taking the soft\nrusset and purple of decline. Faint odours of wood smoke seemed to flit\nover the moor, and the sharp lines of the hill fastnesses were drawn as\nwith a graving-tool against the sky. She resolved to go to the Midburn\nand climb up the cleft, for the place was still a centre of memory. So\nshe kept for a mile to the Etterick road, till she came in view of the\nlittle stone bridge where the highway spans the moorland waters.\n\nThere had been intruders in Paradise before her. Broken bottles and\nscraps of paper were defacing the hill turf, and when she turned to get\nto the water's edge she found the rushy coverts trampled on every side.\nFrom somewhere among the trees came the sound of singing--a silly\nmusic-hall catch. It was a sharp surprise, and the girl, in horror at\nthe profanation, was turning in all haste to leave.\n\nBut the Fates had prepared an adventure. Three half-tipsy men came\nswinging down the slope, their arms linked together, and bowlers set\nrakishly on the backs of their heads. They kept up the chorus of the\nsong which was being sung elsewhere, and they suited their rolling gait\nto the measure.\n\n\"For it ain't Maria,\" came the tender melody; and the reassuring phrase\nwas repeated a dozen times. Then by ill-luck they caught sight of the\nastonished Alice, and dropping their musical efforts they hailed her\nfamiliarly. Clearly they were the stragglers of some picnic from the\ntown, the engaging type of gentleman who on such occasions is drunk by\nmidday. They were dressed in ill-fitting Sunday clothes, great flowers\nbeamed from their button-holes, and after the fashion of their kind\ntheir waistcoats were unbuttoned for comfort. The girl tried to go back\nby the way she had come, but to her horror she found that she was\nintercepted. The three gentlemen commanded her retreat.\n\nThey seemed comparatively sober, so she tried entreaty. \"Please, let me\npass,\" she said pleasantly. \"I find I have taken the wrong road.\"\n\n\"No, you haven't, dearie,\" said one of the men, who from a superior\nneatness of apparel might have been a clerk. \"You've come the right\nroad, for you've met us. And now you're not going away.\" And he came\nforward with a protecting arm.\n\nAlice, genuinely frightened, tried to cross the stream and escape by the\nother side. But the crossing was difficult, and she slipped at the\noutset and wet her ankles. One of the three lurched into the water\nafter her, and withdrew with sundry oaths.\n\nThe poor girl was in sad perplexity. Before was an ugly rush of water\nand a leap beyond her strength; behind, three drunken men, their mouths\nfull of endearment and scurrility. She looked despairingly to the level\nwhite road for the Perseus who should deliver her.\n\nAnd to her joy the deliverer was not wanting. In the thick of the idiot\nshouting of the trio there came the clink-clank of a horse's feet and a\nyoung man came over the bridge. He saw the picture at a glance and its\nmeaning; and it took him short time to be on his feet and then over the\nbroken stone wall to the waterside. Suddenly to the girl's delight\nthere appeared at the back of the roughs the inquiring, sunburnt face of\nLewis.\n\nThe men turned and stared with hanging jaws. \"Now, what the dickens is\nthis?\" he cried, and catching two of their necks he pulled their heads\ntogether and then flung them apart.\n\nThe three seemed sobered by the apparition. \"And what the h-ll is your\nbusiness?\" they cried conjointly; and one, a dark-browed fellow, doubled\nhis fists and advanced.\n\nLewis stood regarding them with a smiling face and very bright, cross\neyes. \"Are you by way of insulting this lady? If you weren't drunk,\nI'd teach you manners. Get out of this in case I forget myself.\"\n\nFor answer the foremost of the men hit out. A glance convinced Lewis\nthat there was enough sobriety to make a fight of it. \"Miss\nWishart ... Alice,\" he cried, \"come back and go down to the road\nand see to my horse, please. I'll be down in a second.\"\n\nThe girl obeyed, and so it fell out that there was no witness to that\nburn-side encounter. It was a complex fight and it lasted for more than\na second. Two of the men had the grace to feel ashamed of themselves\nhalf-way through, and retired from the contest with shaky limbs and\naching faces. The third had to be assisted to his feet in the end by\nhis antagonist. It was not a good fight, for the three were\npasty-faced, overgrown young men, in no training and stupid with liquor.\nBut they pressed hard on Lewis for a little, till he was compelled in\nself-defence to treat them as fair opponents.\n\nHe came down the road in a quarter of an hour with a huge rent in his\ncoat-sleeve and a small cut on his forehead. He was warm and\nbreathless, still righteously indignant at the event, and half-ashamed\nof so degrading an encounter. He found the girl standing statue-like,\nholding the bridle-rein, and looking into the distance with vacant eyes.\n\n\"Are you going back to Glenavelin, Miss Wishart?\" he asked. \"I think I\nhad better go with you if you will allow me.\"\n\nAlice mutely assented and walked beside him while he led his horse. He\ncould think of nothing to say. The whole world lay between them now,\nand there was no single word which either could speak without showing\nsome trace of the tragic separation.\n\nIt was the girl who first broke the silence.\n\n\"I want to thank you with all my heart,\" she stammered. And then by an\nawkward intuition she looked in his face and saw written there all the\nhopelessness and longing which he was striving to conceal. For one\nmoment she saw clearly, and then the crooked perplexities of the world\nseemed to stare cruelly in her eyes. A sob caught her voice, and before\nshe was conscious of her action she laid a hand on Lewis's arm and burst\ninto tears.\n\nThe sight was so unexpected that it deprived him of all power of action.\nThen came the fatally easy solution that it was but reaction of\nover-strained nerves. Always ill at ease in a woman's presence, a\nwoman's tears reduced him to despair. He stroked her hair gently as he\nwould have quieted a favourite horse.\n\n\"I am so sorry that these brutes have frightened you. But here we are\nat Glenavelin gates.\"\n\nAnd all the while his heart was crying out to him to clasp her in his\narms, and the words which trembled on his tongue were the passionate\nconsolations of a lover.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA MOVEMENT OF THE POWERS\n\n\nAt Mrs. Montrayner's dinner parties a world of silent men is sandwiched\nbetween a _monde_ of chattering women. The hostess has a taste for busy\ncelebrities who eat their dinner without thought of the cookery, and\nregard their fair neighbours much as the diners think of the band in a\nrestaurant. She chose her company with care, and if at her table there\nwas not the busy clack of a fluent conversation, there was always the\npossibility of _bons mots_ and the off-chance of a State secret. So to\nhave dined with the Montrayners became a boast in a small social set,\nand to the unilluminate the Montrayner banquets seemed scarce less\nmomentous than Cabinet meetings.\n\nWratislaw found himself staring dully at a snowy bank of flowers and\nlooking listlessly at the faces beyond. He was extremely worried, and\nhis grey face and sunken eyes showed the labour he had been passing\nthrough. The country was approaching the throes of a crisis, and as yet\nthe future was a blind alley to him. There was an autumn session, and\nhe had been badgered all the afternoon in the Commons; his even temper\nhad been perilously near its limits, and he had been betrayed\nunconsciously into certain ineptitudes which he knew would grin in his\nface on the morrow from a dozen leading articles. The Continent seemed\non the edge of an outbreak; in the East especially, Russia by a score of\npetty acts had seemed to foreshadow an incomprehensible policy. It was\na powder-barrel waiting for the spark; and he felt dismally that the\nspark might come at any moment from some unlooked-for quarter of the\nglobe. He ran over in his mind the position of foreign affairs. All\nseemed vaguely safe; and yet he was conscious that all was vaguely\nunsettled. The world was on the eve of one of its cyclic changes, and\nunrest seemed to make the air murky.\n\nHe tried to be polite and listened attentively to the lady on his right,\nwho was telling him the latest gossip about a certain famous marriage.\nBut his air was so manifestly artificial that she turned to the\npresumably more attractive topic of his doings.\n\n\"You look ill,\" she said--she was one who adopted the motherly air\ntowards young men, which only a pretty woman can use. \"Are they\nover-working you in the House?\"\n\n\"Pretty fair,\" and he smiled grimly. \"But really I can't complain. I\nhave had eight hours' sleep in the last four days, and I don't think\nBeauregard could say as much. Some day I shall break loose and go to a\nquiet place and sleep for a week. Brittany would do--or Scotland.\"\n\n\"I was in Scotland last week,\" she said. \"I didn't find it quiet. It\nwas at one of those theatrical Highland houses where they pipe you to\nsleep and pipe you to breakfast. I used to have to sit up all night by\nthe fire and read Marius the Epicurean, to compose myself. Did you ever\ntry the specific?\"\n\n\"No,\" he said, laughing. \"I always soothe my nerves with Blue-books.\"\n\nShe made a mouth at the thought. \"And do you know I met such a nice man\nup there, who said you were a great friend of his? His name was\nHaystoun.\"\n\n\"Do you remember his Christian name?\" he asked.\n\n\"Lewis,\" she said without hesitation.\n\nHe laughed. \"He is a man who should only have one name and that his\nChristian one. I never heard him called 'Haystoun' in my life. How is\nhe?\"\n\n\"He seemed well, but he struck me as being at rather a loose end. What\nis wrong with him? You know him well and can tell me. He seems to have\nnothing to do; to have fallen out of his niche, you know. And he looks\nso extraordinarily clever.\"\n\n\"He _is_ extraordinarily clever. But if I undertook to tell you what\nwas wrong with Lewie Haystoun, I should never get to the House to-night.\nThe vitality of a great family has run to a close in him. He is strong\nand able, and yet, unless the miracle of miracles happens, he will never\ndo anything. Two hundred years ago he might have led some mad Jacobite\nplot to success. Three hundred and he might have been another Raleigh.\nSix hundred, and there would have been a new crusade. But as it is, he\nis out of harmony with his times; life is too easy and mannered; the\nfield for a man's courage is in petty and recondite things, and Lewie is\nnot fitted to understand it. And all this, you see, spells a kind of\ncowardice: and if you have a friend who is a hero out of joint, a great\nman smothered in the wrong sort of civilization, and all the while one\nwho is building up for himself with the world and in his own heart the\nreputation of a coward, you naturally grow hot and bitter.\"\n\nThe lady looked curiously at the speaker. She had never heard the\nsilent politician speak so earnestly before.\n\n\"It seems to me a clear case of _chercher la femme_,\" said she.\n\n\"That,\" said Wratislaw with emphasis, \"is the needle-point of the whole\nbusiness. He has fallen in love with just the wrong sort of woman.\nVery pretty, very good, a demure puritanical little Pharisee, clever\nenough, too, to see Lewie's merits, too weak to hope to remedy them, and\ntoo full of prejudice to accept them. There you have the makings of a\nvery pretty tragedy.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry,\" said the lady. She was touched by this man's anxiety\nfor his friend, and Mr. Lewis Haystoun, whom she was never likely to\nmeet again, became a figure of interest in her eyes. She turned to say\nsomething more, but Wratislaw, having unburdened his soul to some one,\nand feeling a little relieved, was watching his chief's face further\ndown the table. That nobleman, hopelessly ill at ease, had given up the\npretence of amiability and was now making frantic endeavours to send\nmute signals across the flowers to his under secretary.\n\nThe Montrayner guests seldom linger. Within half an hour after the\nladies left the table Beauregard and Wratislaw were taking leave and\nhurrying into their greatcoats.\n\n\"You are going down to the House,\" said the elder man, \"and I'll come\ntoo. I want to have some talk with you. I tried to catch your eye at\ndinner to get you to come round and deliver me from old Montrayner, for\nI had to sit on his right hand and couldn't come round to you.\nHeigho-ho! I wish I was a Trappist.\"\n\nThe cab had turned out of Piccadilly into St. James's Street before\neither man spoke again. The tossing lights of a windy autumn evening\nwere shimmering on the wet pavement, and faces looked spectral white in\nthe morris-dance of shine and shadow. Wratislaw, whose soul was sick\nfor high, clean winds and the great spaces of the moors, was thinking of\nGlenavelin and Lewis and the strong, quickening north. His companion\nwas furrowing his brow over some knotty problem in his duties.\n\nIn Pall Mall there was a lull in the noise, but neither seemed disposed\nto talk.\n\n\"We had better wait till we get to the House,\" said Beauregard. \"We\nmust have peace, for I have got the most vexatious business to speak\nabout.\" And again he wrinkled his anxious brows and stared in front of\nhim.\n\nThey entered a private room where the fire had burned itself out, and\nthe lights fell on heavy furniture and cheerless solitude. Beauregard\nspread himself out in an arm-chair, and stared at the ceiling.\nWratislaw, knowing his chief's manners, stood before the blackened grate\nand waited.\n\n\"Fetch me an atlas--that big one, and find the map of the Indian\nfrontier.\" Wratislaw obeyed and stretched the huge folio on the table.\n\nThe elder man ran his forefinger in a circle.\n\n\"There--that wretched radius is the plague of my life. Our reports stop\nshort at that line, and reliable information begins again some hundreds\nof miles north. Meanwhile--between?\" And he shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"I got news to-day in a roundabout way from Taghati. That's the town\njust within the Russian frontier there. It seems that the whole country\nis in a ferment. The hill tribes are out and the Russian frontier line\nis threatened. So they say. I have the actual names of the people who\nare making the row. Russian troops are being massed along the line\nthere. The whole place, you know, has been for long a military beehive\nand absurdly over-garrisoned, so there is no difficulty about the\nmassing. The difficulty lies in the reason. Three thousand square\nmiles or so of mountain cannot be so dangerous. One would think that\nthe whole Afghan nation was meditating a descent on the Amu Daria.\" He\nglanced up at his companion, and the two men saw the same anxiety in\neach other's eyes.\n\n\"Anything more of Marka?\" asked Wratislaw.\n\n\"Nothing definite. He is somewhere in the Pamirs, up to some devilry or\nother. Oh, by the by, there is something I have forgotten. I found out\nthe other day that our gentleman had been down quite recently in\nsouth-west Kashmir. He was Arthur Marker at the time, the son of a\nGerman count and a Scotch mother, you understand. Immensely popular,\ntoo, among natives and Europeans alike. He went south from Bardur, and\napparently returned north by the Punjab. At Bardur, Logan and Thwaite\nwere immensely fascinated, Gribton remained doubtful. Now the good\nGribton is coming home, and so he will have the place for a happy\nhunting-ground.\"\n\nWratislaw was puffing his under-lip in deep thought. \"It is a sweet\nbusiness,\" he said. \"But what can we do? Only wait?\"\n\n\"Yes, one could wait if Marka were the only disquieting feature. But\nwhat about Taghati and the Russian activity? What on earth is going on\nor about to go on in this square inch of mountain land to make all the\npother? If it is a tribal war on a first-class scale then we must know\nabout it, for it is in the highest degree our concern too. If it is\nanything else, things look more than doubtful. All the rest I don't\nmind. It's open and obvious, and we are on the alert. But that little\nbit of frontier there is so little known and apparently so remote that I\nbegin to be afraid of trouble in that direction. What do you think?\"\n\nWratislaw shook his head. He had no opinion to offer.\n\n\"At any rate, you need fear no awkward questions in the House, for this\nsort of thing cannot be public for months.\"\n\n\"I am wondering whether somebody should not go out. Somebody quite\nunofficial and sufficiently clever.\"\n\n\"My thought too,\" said Beauregard. \"The pinch is where to get our man\nfrom. I have been casting up possibilities all day, and this one is too\nclever, another too dull, another too timid, and another too\nhare-brained.\"\n\nWratislaw seemed sunk in a brown study.\n\n\"Do you remember my telling you once about my friend Lewis Haystoun?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"I remember perfectly. What made him get so badly beaten? He ought to\nhave won.\"\n\n\"That's part of my point,\" said the other. \"If I knew him less well\nthan I do I should say he was the man cut out by Providence for the\nwork. He has been to the place, he knows the ropes of travelling, he is\nexceedingly well-informed, and he is uncommonly clever. But he is badly\noff colour. The thing might be the saving of him, or the ruin--in which\ncase, of course, he would also be the ruin of the thing.\"\n\n\"As risky as that?\" Beauregard asked. \"I have heard something of him,\nbut I thought it merely his youth. What's wrong with him?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can't tell. A thousand things, but all might be done away with\nby a single chance like this. I tell you what I'll do. After to-night\nI can be spared for a couple of days. I feel rather hipped myself, so I\nshall get up to the north and see my man. I know the circumstances and\nI know Lewis. If the two are likely to suit each other I have your\nauthority to give him your message?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my dear Wratislaw. I have all the confidence in the world\nin your judgment. You will be back the day after to-morrow?\"\n\n\"I shall only be out of the House one night, and I think the game worth\nit. I need not tell you that I am infernally anxious both about the\nbusiness and my friend. It is just on the cards that one might be the\nsolution of the other.\"\n\n\"You understand everything?\"\n\n\"Everything. I promise you I shall be exacting enough. And now I had\nbetter be looking after my own work.\"\n\nBeauregard stared after him as he went out of the room and remained for\na few minutes in deep thought. Then he deliberately wrote out a foreign\ntelegram form and rang the bell.\n\n\"I fancy I know the man,\" he said to himself. \"He will go. Meantime I\ncan prepare things for his passage.\" The telegram was to the fugitive\nGribton at Florence, asking him to meet a certain Mr. Haystoun at the\nEmbassy in Paris within a week for the discussion of a particular\nquestion.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE BRINK OF THE RUBICON\n\n\nThe next evening Wratislaw drove in a hired dogcart up Glenavelin from\nGledsmuir just as a stormy autumn twilight was setting in over the bare\nfields. A wild back-end had followed on the tracks of a marvellous\nsummer. Though it was still October the leaves lay heaped beneath the\nhedgerows, the bracken had yellowed to a dismal hue of decay, and the\nheather had turned from the purple of its flower to the grey-blue of its\npassing. Rain had fallen, and the long road-side pools were fired by\nthe westering sun. Glenavelin looked crooked and fantastic in the\nfalling shadows, and two miles farther the high lights of Etterick rose\nlike a star in the bosom of the hills. Seen after many weeks' work in\nthe bustle and confinement of town, the solitary, shadow-haunted world\nsoothed and comforted.\n\nHe found Lewis in his room alone. The place was quite dark for no lamp\nwas lit, and only a merry fire showed the occupant. He welcomed his\nfriend with crazy vehemence, pushing him into a great armchair, offering\na dozen varieties of refreshment, and leaving the butler aghast with\ncontradictory messages about dinner.\n\n\"Oh, Tommy, upon my soul, it is good to see you here! I was getting as\ndull as an owl.\"\n\n\"Are you alone?\" Wratislaw asked.\n\n\"George is staying here, but he has gone over to Glenaller to a big\nshoot. I didn't care much about it, so I stayed at home. He will be\nback to-morrow.\"\n\nLewis's face in the firelight seemed cheerful and wholesome enough, but\nhis words belied it. Wratislaw wondered why this man, who had been wont\nto travel to the ends of the earth for good shooting, should deny\nhimself the famous Glenaller coverts.\n\nAt dinner the lamplight showed him more clearly, and the worried look in\nhis eyes could not be hidden. He was listless, too, his kindly,\nboisterous manner seemed to have forsaken him, and he had acquired a\ngreat habit of abstracted silence. He asked about recent events in the\nHouse, commenting shrewdly enough, but without interest. When Wratislaw\nin turn questioned him on his doings, he had none of the ready\nenthusiasm which had been used to accompany his talk on sport. He gave\nbare figures and was silent.\n\nAfterwards in his own sanctum, with drawn curtains and a leaping fire,\nhe became more cheerful. It was hard to be moody in that pleasant room,\nwith the light glancing from silver and vellum and dark oak, and a\nthousand memories about it of the clean, outdoor life. Wratislaw\nstretched his legs to the blaze and watched the coils of blue smoke\nmounting from his pipe with a feeling of keen pleasure. His errand was\nout of the focus of his thoughts.\n\nIt was Lewis himself who recalled him to the business.\n\n\"I thought of coming down to town,\" he said. \"I have been getting out\nof spirits up here, and I wanted to be near you.\"\n\n\"Then it was an excellent chance which brought me up to-night. But why\nare you dull? I thought you were the sort of man who is sufficient unto\nhimself, you know.\"\n\n\"I am not,\" he said sharply. \"I never realized my gross insufficiency\nso bitterly.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Wratislaw, sitting up, \"love?\"\n\n\"Did you happen to see Miss Wishart's engagement in the papers?\"\n\n\"I never read the papers. But I have heard about this: in fact, I\nbelieve I have congratulated Stocks.\"\n\n\"Do you know that she ought to have married me?\" Lewis cried almost\nshrilly. \"I swear she loved me. It was only my hideous folly that\ndrove her from me.\"\n\n\"Folly?\" said Wratislaw, smiling. \"Folly? Well you might call it\nthat. I have come up 'ane's errand,' as your people hereabouts say, to\ntalk to you like a schoolmaster, Lewie. Do you mind a good talking-to?\"\n\n\"I need it,\" he said. \"Only it won't do any good, because I have been\ntalking to myself for a month without effect. Do you know what I am,\nTommy?\"\n\n\"I am prepared to hear,\" said the other.\n\n\"A coward! It sounds nice, doesn't it? I am a shirker, a man who would\nbe drummed out of any regiment.\"\n\n\"Rot!\" said Wratislaw. \"In that sort of thing you have the courage of\nyour kind. You are the wrong sort of breed for common shirking cowards.\nWhy, man, you might get the Victoria Cross ten times over with ease, as\nfar as that goes. Only you wouldn't, for you are something much more\nsubtle and recondite than a coward.\"\n\nIt was Lewis's turn for the request. \"I am prepared to hear,\" he said.\n\n\"A fool! An arrant, extraordinary fool! A fool of quality and parts, a\nfool who is the best fellow in the world and who has every virtue a man\ncan wish, but at the same time a conspicuous monument of folly. And it\nis this that I have come to speak about.\"\n\nLewis sat back in his chair with his eyes fixed on the glowing coal.\n\n\"I want you to make it all plain,\" he said slowly. \"I know it all\nalready; I have got the dull, dead consciousness of it in my heart, but\nI want to hear it put into words.\" And he set his lips like a man in\npain.\n\n\"It is hard,\" said Wratislaw, \"devilish hard, but I've got to try.\" He\nknocked out the ashes from his pipe and leaned forward.\n\n\"What would you call the highest happiness, Lewie?\" he asked.\n\n\"The sense of competence,\" was the answer, given without hesitation.\n\n\"Right. And what do we mean by competence? Not success! God knows it\nis something very different from success! Any fool may be successful,\nif the gods wish to hurt him. Competence means that splendid joy in\nyour own powers and the approval of your own heart, which great men feel\nalways and lesser men now and again at favoured intervals. There are a\ncertain number of things in the world to be done, and we have got to do\nthem. We may fail--it doesn't in the least matter. We may get killed\nin the attempt--it matters still less. The things may not altogether be\nworth doing--it is of very little importance. It is ourselves we have\ngot to judge by. If we are playing our part well, and know it, then we\ncan thank God and go on. That is what I call happiness.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"And how are you to get happiness? Not by thinking about it. The great\nthings of the world have all been done by men who didn't stop to reflect\non them. If a man comes to a halt and analyses his motives and\ndistrusts the value of the thing he strives for, then the odds are that\nhis halt is final. You strive to strive and not to attain. A man must\nhave that direct practical virtue which forgets itself and sees only its\nwork. Parsons will tell you that all virtue is self-sacrifice, and they\nare right, though not in the way they mean. It may all seem a tissue of\ncontradictions. You must not pitch on too fanciful a goal, nor, on the\nother hand, must you think on yourself. And it is a contradiction which\nonly resolves itself in practice, one of those anomalies on which the\nworld is built up.\"\n\nLewis nodded his head.\n\n\"And the moral of it all is that there are two sorts of people who will\nnever do any good on this planet. One is the class which makes formulas\nand shallow little ideals its gods and has no glimpse of human needs and\nthe plain issues of life. The other is the egotist whose eye is always\nfilled with his own figure, who investigates his motives, and hesitates\nand finicks, till Death knocks him on the head and there is an end of\nhim. Of the two give me the second, for even a narrow little\negotistical self is better than a formula. But I pray to be delivered\nfrom both.\"\n\n\"'Then who shall stand if Thou, O Lord, dost mark iniquity?'\" Lewis\nquoted.\n\n\"There are two men only who will not be ashamed to look their work in\nthe face in the end--the brazen opportunist and the rigid Puritan.\nSuppose you had some desperate frontier work to get through with and a\nbody of men to pick for it, whom would you take? Not the ordinary,\ncolourless, respectable being, and still less academic nonentities! If\nI had my pick, my companions should either be the narrowest religionists\nor frank, unashamed blackguards. I should go to the Calvinists and the\nfanatics for choice, but if I could not get them then I should have the\nrankers. For, don't you see, the first would have the fear of God in\nthem, and that somehow keeps a man from fearing anything else. They\nwould do their work because they believed it to be their duty. And the\nsecond would have the love of the sport in them, and they should also be\nmade to dwell in the fear of me. They would do their work because they\nliked it, and liked me, and I told them to do it.\"\n\n\"I agree with you absolutely,\" said Lewis. \"I never thought otherwise.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said Wratislaw. \"Now for my application. You've had the\nmisfortune to fall between the two stools, Lewie. You're too clever for\na Puritan and too good for a ranker. You're too finicking and\nhigh-strung and fanciful for a prosaic world. You think yourself the\nlaughing philosopher with an infinite appreciation of everything, and\nyet you have not the humour to stand aside and laugh at yourself.\"\n\n\"I am a coward, as I have told you,\" said the other dourly.\n\n\"No, you are not. But you can't bring yourself down to the world of\ncompromises, which is the world of action. You have lost the practical\ntouch. You muddled your fight with Stocks because you couldn't get out\nof touch with your own little world in practice, however you might\nmanage it in theory. You can't be single-hearted. Twenty impulses are\nalways pulling different ways with you, and the result is that you\nbecome an unhappy, self-conscious waverer.\"\n\nLewis was staring into the fire, and the older man leaned forward and\nput his hand very tenderly on his shoulder.\n\n\"I don't want to speak about the thing which gives you most pain, old\nchap; but I think you have spoiled your chances in the same way in\nanother matter--the most important matter a man can have to do with,\nthough it ill becomes a cynical bachelor like myself to say it.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Lewis dismally.\n\n\"You see it is the Nemesis of your race which has overtaken you. The\nrich, strong blood of you Haystouns must be given room or it sours into\nmoodiness. It is either a spoon or a spoiled horn with you. You are\ncapable of the big virtues, and just because of it you are\nextraordinarily apt to go to the devil. Not the ordinary devil, of\ncourse, but to a very effective substitute. You want to be braced and\npulled together. A war might do it, if you were a soldier. A religious\nenthusiasm would do it, if that were possible for you. As it is, I have\nsomething else, which I came up to propose to you.\"\n\nLewis faced round in an attitude of polite attention. But his eyes had\nno interest in them.\n\n\"You know Bardur and the country about there pretty well?\"\n\nLewis nodded.\n\n\"Also I once talked to you about a man called Marka. Do you remember?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do. The man who went north from Bardur the week\nbefore I turned up there?\"\n\n\"Well, there's trouble brewing thereabouts. You know the Taghati\ncountry up beyond the Russian line. Things are in a ferment there,\ngreat military preparations and all the rest of it, and the reason, they\nsay, is that the hill-tribes in the intervening No-man's-land are at\ntheir old games. Things look very ugly abroad just now, and we can't\nafford to neglect anything when a crisis may be at the door. So we want\na man to go out there and find out the truth.\"\n\nLewis had straightened himself and was on his feet before Wratislaw had\ndone. \"Upon my word,\" he cried, \"if it isn't what I expected! We have\nbeen far too sure of the safety of that Kashmir frontier. You mean, of\ncourse, that there may be a chance of an invasion?\"\n\n\"I mean nothing. But things look ugly enough in Europe just now, and\nAsia would naturally be the starting-point.\"\n\nLewis made some rapid calculations in his head which he jotted on the\nwood of the fireplace. \"It would take a week to get from Bardur to\nTaghati by the ordinary Kashmir rate of travelling, but of course the\nplace is unknown and it might take months. One would have to try it?\"\n\n\"I can only give you the bare facts. If you decide to go, Beauregard\nwill give you particulars in town.\"\n\n\"When would he want to know?\"\n\n\"At once. I go back to-morrow morning, and I must have your answer\nwithin three days. You would be required to start within a week. You\ncan take time and quiet to make up your mind.\"\n\n\"It's a great chance,\" said Lewis. \"Does Beauregard think it\nimportant?\"\n\n\"Of the highest importance. Also, of course it is dangerous. The\ntravelling is hard, and you may be knocked on the head at any moment as\na spy.\"\n\n\"I don't mind that,\" said the other, flushing. \"I've been through the\nsame thing before.\"\n\n\"I need not say the work will be very difficult. Remember that your\nerrand will not be official, so in case of failure or trouble we could\nnot support you. We might even have to disclaim all responsibility. In\nthe event of success, on the other hand, your fortune is something more\nthan made.\"\n\n\"Would you go?\" came the question.\n\n\"No,\" said Wratislaw, \"I shouldn't.\"\n\n\"But if you were in my place?\"\n\n\"I should hope that I would, but then I might not have the courage. I\nam giving you the brave man's choice, Lewie. You will be going out to\nuncertainty and difficulty and extreme danger. On the other hand, I\nbelieve in my soul it will harden you into the man you ought to be.\nLord knows I would rather have you stay at home!\"\n\nThe younger man looked up for a second and saw something in Wratislaw's\nface which made him turn away his eyes. The look of honest regret cut\nhim to the heart. Those friends of his, of whom he was in nowise\nworthy, made the burden of his self-distrust doubly heavy.\n\n\"I will tell you within three days,\" he said hoarsely. \"God bless you,\nTommy. I don't deserve to have a man like you troubling himself about\nme.\"\n\nIt was his one spoken tribute to their friendship; and both, with the\nnervousness of honest men in the presence of emotion, hastened to change\nthe subject.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHE FURTHER BRINK\n\n\nWratislaw left betimes the next morning, and a long day faced Lewis with\nevery hour clamouring for a decision. George would be back by noon, and\nbefore his return he must seek quiet and the chances of reflection. He\nwas happy with a miserable fluctuating happiness. Of a sudden his\nhorizon was enlarged, but as he gazed it seemed to narrow again. His\nmind was still unplumbed; somewhere in its depths might lie the\nshrinking and unwillingness which would bind him to the dreary present.\n\nHe went out to the autumn hills and sought the ridge which runs for\nmiles on the lip of the glen. It was a grey day, with snow waiting in\ncloud-banks in the north sky and a thin wind whistling through the\npines. The scene matched his humour. He was in love for the moment\nwith the stony and stormy in life. He hungered morbidly for\nill-fortune, something to stamp out the ease in his soul, and weld him\ninto the form of a man.\n\nHe had got his chance and the rest lay with himself. It was a chance of\nhigh adventure, a great mission, a limitless future. At the thought the\nold fever began to rise in his blood. The hot, clear smell of rock and\nsand, the brown depths of the waters, the far white peaks running up\namong the stars, all spoke to him with the long-remembered call. Once\nmore he should taste life, and, alert in mind and body, hold up his chin\namong his fellows. It would be a contest of wits, and for all his\ncowardice this was not the contest he shrank from.\n\nAnd then there came back on him, like a flood, the dumb misery of\nincompetence which had weighed on heart and brain. The hatred of the\nwhole struggling, sordid crew, all the cant and ugliness and ignorance\nof a mad world, his weakness in the face of it, his fall from common\nvirtue, his nerveless indolence--all stung him like needle points, till\nhe cried out in agony. Anything to deliver his soul from such a\nbondage, and in his extreme bitterness his mind closed with Wratislaw's\noffer.\n\nHe felt--and it is a proof of his weakness--a certain nameless feeling\nof content when he had once forced himself into the resolution. Now at\nleast he had found a helm and a port to strain to. As his fancy dwelt\nupon the mission and drew airy pictures of the land, he found to his\ndelight a boyish enthusiasm arising. Old simple pleasures seemed for\nthe moment dear. There was a zest for toils and discomforts, a\ntolerance of failure, which had been aforetime his chief traveller's\nheritage.\n\nAnd then as he came to the ridge where the road passes from Glenavelin\nto Glen Adler, he stopped as in duty bound to look at the famous\nprospect. You stand at the shedding of two streams; behind, the green\nand woodland spaces of the pastoral Avelin; at the feet, a land of\nstones and dwarf junipers and naked rifts in the hills, with\nwhite-falling waters and dark shadows even at midday. And then, beyond\nand afar, the lines of hill-land crowd upon each other till the eye is\nlost in a mystery of grey rock and brown heather and single bald peaks\nrising sentinel-like in the waste. The grey heavens lent a chill\neeriness to the dim grey distances; the sharp winds, the forerunners of\nsnow, blew over the moors like blasts from a primeval night.\n\nBy an odd vagary of temper the love of these bleak hills blazed up\nfiercely in his heart. Never before had he felt so keenly the nameless\nglamour of his own heritage. He had not been back six months and yet he\nhad come to accept all things as matters of course, the beauty of the\nplace, its sport, its memories. Rarely had he felt that intimate joy in\nit which lies at the bottom of all true souls. There is a sentiment\nwhich old poets have made into songs and called the \"Lilt of the\nHeather,\" and which is knit closer to man's heart than love of wife or\nkin or his own fair fortune. It had not come to him in the time of the\nhills' glory, but now on the brink of winter the far-off melancholy of\nthe place and its infinite fascination seemed to clutch at his\nheart-strings. It was his own land, the place of his fathers; and now\nhe must sever himself from it and carry only a barren memory.\n\nAnd yet he felt no melancholy. Rather it was the immortal gaiety of the\nwanderer, to whom the homeland is dearest as a memory, who pitches his\ncamp by waters of Babylon and yet as ever the old word on his lip, the\nold song in his ear, and the kindly picture in his heart. Strange that\nit is the little races who wander farthest and yet have the eternal\nhome-sickness! And yet not strange, for to the little peoples, their\nland, bare and uncouth and unfriendly for the needs of life, must be\nmore the ideal, the dream, than the satisfaction. The lush countries\ngive corn and wine for their folks, the little bare places afford no\nmore than a spiritual heritage. Yet spiritual it is, and for two men\nwho in the moment of their extremity will think on meadow, woodland, or\nplacid village, a score will figure the windy hill, the grey lochan, and\nthe mournful sea.\n\nFor the moment he felt a self-pity which he cast from him. To this\ndegradation at least he should never come. But as the thought of Alice\ncame up ever and again, his longing for her seemed to be changed from\nhot pain to a chastened regret. The red hearth-fire was no more in his\nfancy. The hunger for domesticity had gone, and the girl was now less\nthe wife he had desired than the dream of love he had vainly followed.\nAs he came back across the moors, for the first time for weeks his\njealous love left him at peace. His had been a fanciful Sylvia, \"holy,\nfair, and wise\"; and what if mortal Sylvia were unkind, there was yet\ncomfort in this elusive lady of his memories.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nHe found George at the end of a second breakfast, a very ruddy, happy\nyoung man hunting high and low for a lost tobacco-jar.\n\n\"Oh, first-class,\" he said in answer to Lewis's question. \"Out and out\nthe best day's shooting I've had in my life. You were an ass not to\ncome, you know. A lot of your friends there, tremendously disappointed\ntoo, and entrusted me with a lot of messages for you which I have\nforgotten.\"\n\nHis companion's high spirits infected Lewis and he fell into cheery\ngossip. Then he could contain the news no more.\n\n\"I had Tommy up last night on a flying visit. He says that Beauregard\nwants me to go out to Kashmir again. There has been some threatening of\na row up there, and he thinks that as I know the place I might be able\nto get good information.\"\n\n\"Official?\" asked George.\n\n\"Practically, yes; but in theory it's quite off my own bat, and they are\ngood enough to tell me that they will not acknowledge responsibility.\nHowever, it's a great chance and I am going.\"\n\n\"Good,\" said the other, and his face and voice had settled into gravity.\n\"Pretty fair sport up in those parts, isn't there?\"\n\n\"Pretty fair? it's about the best in the world. Your ordinary man who\ngoes the grand tour comes home raving about the sport in the Himalayan\nfoothills, and it's not to be named with this.\"\n\n\"Good chance too of a first-rate row, isn't there? Natives troublesome,\nand Russia near, and that sort of thing?\" George's manner showed a\ngrowing enthusiasm.\n\n\"A rather good chance. It is about that I'm going, you know.\"\n\n\"Then if you don't mind, I am coming with you.\"\n\nLewis stared, incredulous.\n\n\"It's quite true. I am serious enough. I am doing nothing at the Bar,\nand I want to travel, proper travelling, where you are not coddled with\nrailways and hotels.\"\n\n\"But it's hideously risky, and probably very arduous and thankless. You\nwill tire of it in a week.\"\n\n\"I won't,\" said George, \"and in any case I'll make my book for that.\nYou must let me come, Lewie. I simply couldn't stand your going off\nalone.\"\n\n\"But I may have to leave you. There are places where one can go when\ntwo can't.\"\n\n\"When you come to that sort of place I'll stay behind. I'll be quite\nunder your orders.\"\n\n\"Well, at any rate take some time to think over it.\"\n\n\"Bless you, I don't want time to think over it,\" cried George. \"I know\nmy own mind. It's the chance I've been waiting on for years.\"\n\n\"Thanks tremendously then, my dear chap,\" said Lewis, very ill at ease.\n\"It's very good of you. I must wire at once to Tommy.\"\n\n\"I'll take it down, if you like. I want to try that new mare of yours\nin the dog-cart.\"\n\nWhen his host had left the room George forgot to light his pipe, but\nwalked instead to the window and whistled solemnly. \"Poor old man,\" he\nsaid softly to himself, \"it had to come to this, but I'm hanged if he\ndoesn't take it like a Trojan.\" And he added certain striking comments\non the ways of womankind and the afflictions of life, which, being\nexpressed in Mr. Winterham's curious phraseology, need not be set down.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAlice had gone out after lunch to walk to Gledsmuir, seeking in the\nbitter cold and the dawning storm the freshness which comes from\nconflict. All the way down the glen the north wind had stung her cheeks\nto crimson and blown stray curls about her ears; but when she left the\nlittle market-place to return she found a fine snow powdering the earth,\nand a haze creeping over the hills which threatened storm. A mile of\nthe weather delighted her, but after that she grew weary. When the fall\nthickened she sought the shelter of a way-side cottage, with the purpose\nof either sending to Glenavelin for a carriage or waiting for the\noff-chance of a farmer's gig.\n\nBy four o'clock the snow showed no sign of clearing, but fell in the\nsame steady, noiseless drift. The mistress of the place made the girl\ntea and dispatched her son to Glenavelin. But the errand would take\ntime, for the boy was small, and Alice, ever impatient, stood drumming\non the panes, watching the dreary weather with a dreary heart. The\ngoodwife was standing at the door on the look-out for a passing gig, and\nher cry brought the girl to attention.\n\n\"I see a machine comin'! I think it's the Etterick dowg-cairt. Ye'll\nget a drive in it.\"\n\nAlice had gone to the door, and lo! through the thick fall a dog-cart\ncame into view driven by a tall young man. He recognized her at once,\nand drew up.\n\n\"Hullo, Miss Wishart! Storm-stayed? Can I help you?\"\n\nThe girl looked distrustfully at the very restless horse and he caught\nher diffidence.\n\n\"Don't be afraid. 'What I don't know about 'oases ain't worth\nknowin','\" he quoted with a laugh; and leaning forward he prepared to\nassist her to mount.\n\nThere was nothing for it but to accept, and the next minute she found\nherself in the high seat beside him. Her wraps, sufficient for walking,\nwere scarcely sufficient for a snowy drive, and this, to his credit, the\nyoung man saw. He unbuttoned his tweed shooting-cape, and gravely put\nit round her. A curious dainty figure she made with her face all bright\nwith wind, framed in the great grey cloak.\n\nThe horse jibbed for a second and then swung along the wild road with\nthe vigorous ease of good blood skilfully handled. George was puzzling\nhis brain all the while as to how he should tell his companion something\nwhich she ought to know. The strong drift and the turns of the road\nclaimed much of his attention, so it is possible that he blurted out his\nnews somewhat baldly.\n\n\"Do you know, Miss Wishart, that Lewis Haystoun and I are going off next\nweek? Abroad, you know.\"\n\nThe girl, who had been enjoying the ecstasy of swift motion through the\nbitter weather, glanced up at him with pain in her eyes.\n\n\"Where?\" she asked.\n\n\"To the Indian frontier. We are going to be special unpaid unofficial\nmembers of the Intelligence Department.\"\n\nShe asked the old, timid woman's question about danger.\n\n\"It's where Lewis was before. Only, you see, things have got into a\nmess thereabouts, and the Foreign Office has asked him to go out again.\nBy the by, you mustn't tell any one about this, for it's in strict\nconfidence.\"\n\nThe words were meaningless, and yet they sent a pang through her heart.\nHad he no guess at her inmost feelings? Could he think that she would\ntalk to Mr. Stocks of a thing which was bound up for her with all the\nsorrow and ecstasy of life?\n\nHe looked down and saw that her face had paled and that her mouth was\ndrawn with some emotion. A sudden gleam of light seemed to break in\nupon him.\n\n\"Are you sorry?\" he asked half-unwittingly.\n\nFor answer the girl turned her tragic eyes upon him, tried to speak, and\nfaltered. He cursed himself for a fool and a brute, and whipped up an\nalready over-active horse, till it was all but unmanageable. It was a\nwise move, for it absorbed his attention and gave the poor child at his\nside a chance to recover her composure.\n\nThey came to Glenavelin gates and George turned in. \"I had better drive\nyou to the door, in this charming weather,\" he said. The sight of the\npale little face had moved him to deep pity. He cursed his blindness,\nthe blindness of a whole world of fools, and at the same time, with the\nimpotence of the honest man, he could only wait and be silent.\n\nAt the door he stopped to unbutton his cape from her neck, and even in\nhis nervousness he felt the trembling of her body. She spoke rapidly\nand painfully.\n\n\"I want you to take a message from me to--to--Lewis. Tell him I must\nsee him. Tell him to come to the Midburn foot, to-morrow in the\nafternoon. Oh, I am ashamed to ask you, but you must tell him.\" And\nthen without thanks or good-bye she fled into the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHE BRIDGE OF BROKEN HEARTS\n\n\nListless leaves were tossing in the light wind or borne downward in the\nswirl of the flooded Midburn, to the weary shallows where they lay,\nbeached high and sodden, till the frost nipped and shrivelled their\nrottenness into dust. A bleak, thin wind it was, like a fine sour wine,\nsearching the marrow and bringing no bloom to the cheek. A light snow\npowdered the earth, the grey forerunner of storms.\n\nAlice stood back in the shelter of the broken parapet. The highway with\nits modern crossing-place was some hundreds of yards up stream, but\nhere, at the burn mouth, where the turbid current joined with the cold,\nglittering Avelin, there was a grass-grown track, and an ancient,\nbroken-backed bridge. There were few passers on the high-road, none on\nthis deserted way; but the girl in all her loneliness shrank back into\nthe shadow. In these minutes she endured the bitter mistrust, the sore\nhesitancy, of awaiting on a certain but unknown grief.\n\nShe had not long to wait, for Lewis came down the Avelin side by a\nbypath from Etterick village. His alert gait covered his very real\nconfusion, but to the girl he seemed one who belonged to an alien world\nof cheerfulness. He could not know her grief, and she regretted her\ncoming.\n\nHis manners were the same courteous formalities. The man was torn with\nemotion, and yet he greeted her with a conventional ease.\n\n\"It was so good of you, Miss Wishart, to give me a chance to come and\nsay good-bye. My going is such a sudden affair, that I might have had\nno time to come to Glenavelin, but I could not have left without seeing\nyou.\"\n\nThe girl murmured some indistinct words. \"I hope you will have a good\ntime and come back safely,\" she said, and then she was tongue-tied.\n\nThe two stood before each other, awkward and silent--two between whom no\nword of love had ever been spoken, but whose hearts were clamouring at\nthe iron gates of speech.\n\nAlice's face and neck were dyed crimson, as the impossible position\ndawned on her mind. No word could break down the palisade, of form.\nLewis, his soul a volcano, struggled for the most calm and inept words.\nHe spoke of the weather, of her father, of his aunt's messages.\n\nThen the girl held out her hand.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" she said, looking away from him.\n\nHe held it for a second. \"Good-bye, Miss Wishart,\" he said hoarsely.\nWas this the consummation of his brief ecstasy, the end of months of\nlonging? The steel hand of fate was on him and he turned to leave.\n\nHe turned when he had gone three paces and came back. The girl was\nstill standing by the parapet, but she had averted her face towards the\nwintry waters. His step seemed to fall on deaf ears, and he stood\nbeside her before she looked towards him.\n\nPassion had broken down his awkwardness. He asked the old question with\na shaking voice. \"Alice,\" he said, \"have I vexed you?\"\n\nShe turned to him a pale, distraught face, her eyes brimming over with\nthe sorrow of love, the passionate adventurous longing which claims true\nhearts for ever.\n\nHe caught her in his arms, his heart in a glory of joy.\n\n\"Oh, Alice, darling,\" he cried. \"What has happened to us? I love you,\nI love you, and you have never given me a chance to say it.\"\n\nShe lay passive in his arms for one brief minute and then feebly drew\nback.\n\n\"Sweetheart,\" he cried. \"Sweetheart! For I will call you sweetheart,\nthough we never meet again. You are mine, Alice. We cannot help\nourselves.\"\n\nThe girl stood as in a trance, her eyes caught and held by his face.\n\n\"Oh, the misery of things,\" she said half-sobbing. \"I have given my\nsoul to another, and I knew it was not mine to give. Why, oh why, did\nyou not speak to me sooner? I have been hungering for you and you never\ncame.\"\n\nA sense of his folly choked him.\n\n\"And I have made you suffer, poor darling! And the whole world is out\nof joint for us!\"\n\nThe hopeless feeling of loss, forgotten for a moment, came back to him.\nThe girl was gone from him for ever, though a bridge of hearts should\nalways cross the chasm of their severance.\n\n\"I am going away,\" he said, \"to make reparation. I have my repentance\nto work out, and it will be bitterer than yours, little woman. Ours\nmust be an austere love.\"\n\nShe looked at him till her pale face flushed and a sad exultation woke\nin her eyes.\n\n\"You will never forget?\" she asked wistfully, confident of the answer.\n\n\"Forget!\" he cried. \"It is my only happiness to remember. I am going\naway to be knocked about, dear. Wild, rough work, but with a man's\nchances!\"\n\nFor a moment she let another thought find harbour in her mind. Was the\npast irretrievable, the future predetermined? A woman's word had an old\nright to be broken. If she went to him, would not he welcome her\ngladly, and the future might yet be a heritage for both?\n\nThe thought endured but a moment, for she saw how little simple was the\ncrux of her destiny. The two of them had been set apart by the fates;\neach had salvation to work out alone; no facile union would ever join\nthem. For him there was the shaping of a man's path; for her the\nillumination which only sorrows and parting can bring. And with the\nthought she thought kindly of the man to whom she had pledged her word.\nIt was but a little corner of her heart he could ever possess; but\ndoubtless in such matters he was not ambitious.\n\nLewis walked by her side down the by-path towards Glenavelin. Tragedy\nmuffled in the garments of convention was there, not the old picturesque\nTragic with sword and cloak and steel for the enemy, but the silent\nTragic which pulls at the heart-strings.\n\n\"The summer is over,\" she said. \"It has been a cruel summer, but very\nbright.\"\n\n\"Romance with the jarring modern note which haunts us all to-day,\" he\nsaid. \"This upland country is confused with bustling politics, and\npastoral has been worried to death by sickness of heart. You cannot\nfind the old peaceful life without.\"\n\n\"And within?\" she asked.\n\n\"That is for you and me to determine, dear. God grant it. I have found\nmy princess, like the man in the fairy-tale, but I may not enter the\nkingdom.\"\n\n\"And the poor princess must sit and mope in her high stone tower? It is\na hard world for princesses.\"\n\n\"Hard for the knights, too, for they cannot come back and carry off\ntheir ladies. In the old days it used to be so, but then simplicity has\ngone out of life.\"\n\n\"And the princess waits and watches and cries herself to sleep?\"\n\n\"And the knight goes off to the World's End and never forgets.\"\n\nThey were at Glenavelin gates now, and stood silent against the moment\nof parting. She flew to his arms, for a second his kisses were on her\nlips, and then came the sundering. A storm of tears was in her heart,\nbut with dry eyes she said the words of good-bye. Meanwhile from the\nhills came a drift of snow, and a dreary wind sang in the pines the\ndirge of the dead summer, the plaint of long farewells.\n\n\n\n\nPART II\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHE EASTERN ROAD\n\n\nIf you travel abroad in certain seasons you will find that a type\npredominates among the travellers. From Dover to Calais, from Calais to\nParis, there is an unnatural eagerness on faces, an unrest in gait, a\ndisorder in dress which argues worry and haste. And if you inquire\nfurther, being of a speculative turn, you will find that there is\nsomething in the air. The papers, French and English, have ugly\nheadlines and mystic leaders. Disquiet is in the atmosphere, each man\nhas a solution or a secret, and far at the back sits some body of men\nwho know that a crisis is near and square their backs for it. The\njournalist is sick with work and fancied importance; the diplomat's hair\nwhitens with the game which he cannot understand; the statesman, if he\nbe wise, is in fear, knowing the meaning of such movements, while, if he\nbe foolish, he chirps optimistically in his speeches and is applauded in\nthe press. There are grey faces at the seats of the money-changers, for\nwar, the scourge of small cords, seems preparing for the overturning of\ntheir tables, and the castigation of their persons.\n\nLewis and George rang the bell in the Faubourg St. Honor\u00c3\u00a9 on a Monday\nafternoon, and asked for Lord Rideaux. His lordship was out, but, if\nthey were the English gentlemen who had the appointment with M. Gribton,\nMonsieur would be with them speedily.\n\nLewis looked about the heavily furnished ante-room with its pale yellow\nwalls and thick, green curtains, with the air of a man trying to recall\na memory. \"I came over here with John Lambert, when his father had the\nplace. That was just after I left Oxford. Gad, I was a happy man then.\nI thought I could do anything. They put me next to Madame de Ravignet\nbecause of my French, and because old Ankerville declared that I ought\nto know the cleverest woman in Europe. S\u00c3\u00a9ry, the man who was Premier\nlast year, came and wrung my hand afterwards, said my fortune was\nassured because I had impressed the Ravignet, and no one had ever done\nit before except Bismarck. Ugh, the place is full of ghosts. Poor old\nJohn died a year after, and here am I, far enough, God knows, from my\ngood intentions.\"\n\nA servant announced \"Monsieur Gribton,\" and a little grizzled man\nhobbled in, leaning heavily on a stick. He wore a short beard, and in\nhis tanned face two clever grey eyes twinkled sedately. He shook hands\ngravely when Lewis introduced George, but his eyes immediately returned\nto the former's face.\n\n\"You look a fit pair,\" he said. \"I am instructed to give you all the\nhelp in my power, but I should like to know your game. It isn't sport\nthis time, is it, Haystoun? Logan is still talking about his week with\nyou. Well, well, we can do things at our leisure. I have letters to\nwrite, and then it will be dinner-time, when we can talk. Come to the\nclub at eight, 'Cercle des Voyageurs,' corner of Rue Neuve de St.\nMichel. I expect you belong, Haystoun; and anyway I'll be there.\"\n\nHe bowed them out with his staccato apologies, and the two returned to\ntheir hotel to dress. Two hours later they found Gribton warming his\nhands in the smoking-room of the Cercle, a fussy and garrulous\ngentleman, eager for his dinner. He pointed out such people as he knew,\nand was consumed with curiosity about the others. Lewis wandered about\nthe room before he sat down, shaking hands with several and nodding to\nmany.\n\n\"You seem to know the whole earth,\" said Gribton.\n\n\"I suppose that a world of acquaintance is the only reward of\nslackness,\" Lewis said, laughing. \"It's a trick I have. I never forget\na face and I honestly like to see people again.\"\n\nGeorge pulled his long moustache. \"It's simply hideous the way one is\nforgotten. It's all right for the busy people, for they shift their\nsets with their fortune, but for drones like me it's the saddest thing\nin life. Before we came away, Lewie, I went up for a day to Oxford to\nsee about some things, and stopped a night there. I haven't been down\nlong, and yet I knew nobody at the club except the treasurer, and he had\nnothing to say to me except to ask after you. I went to dinner with the\ndons at the high table, and I nearly perished of the blues. Little\nRiddell chirped about my profession, and that bounder Jackson, who was\nof our year, pretended that he had been your bosom friend. I got so\nbored that I left early and wandered back to the club. Somebody was\nmaking a racket in our old rooms in the High, windows open, you know,\nand singing. I stopped to look at them, and then they started, 'Willie\nbrewed a peck o' maut,' and, 'pon my soul, I had to come away. Couldn't\nstand it. It reminded me so badly of you and Arthur and old John\nLambert, and all the honest men that used to be there. It was\ninfernally absurd that I should have got so sentimental, but that wasn't\nthe worst of it. For I met Tony and he made me come round to a dinner,\nand there I found people I didn't know from Adam drinking the old toasts\nwe started. Gad, they had them all. 'Las Palmas,' 'The Old Guard,'\n'The Wandering Scot,' and all the others. It made me feel as low as an\nowl, and when I got back to the club and saw poor old John's photograph\non the wall, I tell you I went to bed in the most wretched melancholy.\"\n\nLewis stared open-mouthed at George, the irrepressible, in this new\nattitude. He, as the hardened traveller, had had little more than a\ndecent pang of home-sickness. His regret was far deeper and more real\nthan the sentimental article of commerce, and he could afford to be\nalmost gay while George sat in the depths.\n\n\"I'm coming home, and I'm not happy; you young men are going out, and\nyou have got the blues. There's no pleasing weak humanity. I say,\nHaystoun, who's that old man?\" Gribton's jovial looks belied his words.\n\nLewis mentioned a name for his host's benefit. The room was emptying\nrapidly, for the Cercle dined early.\n\n\"Now for business,\" said Gribton, when a waiter had brought the game\ncourse, and they sat in the midst of a desert of linen and velvet. \"I\nhave given the thing up, but I spent twenty of my best years at Bardur.\nSo, as I am instructed to do all in my power to aid you, I am ready.\nFirst, is it sport?\n\n\"Partly,\" said George, but Lewis's head gave denial.\n\n\"Because, if it is, I am not the best man. Well, then, is it\ngeographical? For if it is, there is much to be done.\"\n\n\"Partly,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"Then I take it that the residue is political. You are following the\npopular avenue to polities, I suppose. Leave the 'Varsity very raw,\nknock about in an unintelligent way for three or four years on some\nfrontier, then come home, go into the House, and pose as a specialist in\nforeign affairs. I should have thought you had too much humour for\nthat.\"\n\n\"Only, you see, I have been there before. I am merely going back upon\nmy tracks to make sure. I go purely as an adventurer, hoping to pick up\nsome valuable knowledge, but prepared to fail.\"\n\nGribton helped himself to champagne. \"That's better. Now I know your\nattitude, we can talk like friends. Better come to the small\nsmoking-room. They've got a '51 brandy here which is beyond words.\nHave some for a liqueur.\"\n\nIn the smoking-room Gribton fussed about coffee and cigars for many\nminutes ere he settled down. Then, when he could gaze around and see\nhis two guests in deep armchairs, each smoking and comfortable, he\nreturned to his business.\n\n\"I don't mind telling you a secret,\" he said, \"or rather it's only a\nsecret here, for once you get out there you will find 'Gribton's view,'\nas they call it, well enough known and very much laughed at. I've\nalways been held up to ridicule as an alarmist about that Kashmir\nfrontier, and especially about that Bardur country. Take the whole\nprovince. It's well garrisoned on the north, but below that it is all\nempty and open. The way into the Punjab is as clear as daylight for a\nswift force, and the way to the Punjab is the way to India.\"\n\nLewis rose and went to a rack on the wall. \"Do you mind if I get down\nmaps? These French ones are very good.\" He spread a sheet of canvas on\nthe table, thereby confounding all Gribton's hospitable manoeuvring.\n\n\"There,\" said Gribton, his eyes now free from drowsiness, and clear and\nbright, \"that's the road I fear.\"\n\n\"But these three inches are unknown,\" said Lewis. \"I have been myself\nas far as these hills.\"\n\nGribton looked sharply up. \"You don't know the place as I know it.\nI've never been so far, but I know the sheep-skinned devils who come\nacross from Turkestan. I tell you that place isn't the impenetrable\ncraggy desert that the Government of India thinks it. There's a road\nthere of some sort, and if you're worth your salt you'll find it out.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Lewis. \"I am going to try.\"\n\n\"There's another thing. For the last three years all that north part of\nKashmir, and right away south-west to the Punjab borders, has been\nhonoured with visits from plausible Russian gentlemen who may come down\nby the ordinary caravan routes, or, on the other hand, may not. They\nturn up quite suddenly with tooth-brushes and dressing-cases, and they\ncan't have come from the south. They fool around in Bardur, and then go\ndown to Gilgit, and, I suppose, on to the Punjab. They've got excellent\nmanners, and they hang about the clubs and give dinners and charm the\nwhole neighbourhood. Logan is their bosom friend, and Thwaite declares\nthat their society reconciles him to the place. Then they go away, and\nthe place keeps on the randan for weeks after.\"\n\n\"Do you know a man called Marker by any chance?\" Lewis asked.\n\nGribton looked curiously at the speaker. \"Have you actually heard about\nhim? Yes, I know him, but not very well, and I can't say I ever cared\nfor him. However, he is easily the most popular man in Bardur, and I\ndaresay is a very good fellow. But you don't call him Russian. I\nthought he was sort of half a Scotsman.\"\n\n\"Very likely he is,\" said Lewis. \"I happen to have heard a good deal\nabout him. But what ails you at him?\"\n\n\"Oh, small things,\" and the man laughed. \"You know I am getting elderly\nand cranky, and I like a man to be very fair and four-square. I confess\nI never got to the bottom of the chap. He was a capital sportsman, good\nbridge-player, head like a rock for liquor, and all that; but I'm hanged\nif he didn't seem to me to be playing some sort of game. Another thing,\nhe seemed to me a terribly cold-blooded devil. He was always slapping\npeople on the back and calling them 'dear old fellows,' but I happened\nto see a small interview once between him and one of his servants.\nPerhaps I ought not to mention it, but the thing struck me unpleasantly.\nIt was below the club verandah, and nobody happened to be about except\nmyself, who was dozing after lunch. Marker was rating a servant in some\nBorder tongue--Chil, it sounded like; and I remember wondering how he\ncould have picked it up. I saw the whole thing through a chink in the\nfloor, and I noticed that the servant's face was as grey as a brown\nhillman's can be. Then the fellow suddenly caught his arm and twisted\nit round, the man's face working with pain, though he did not dare to\nutter a sound. It was an ugly sight, and when I caught a glimpse of\nMarker's face, 'pon my soul, those straight black eyebrows of his gave\nhim a most devilish look.\"\n\n\"What's he like to look at?\" George asked.\n\n\"Oh, he's rather tall, very straight, with a sort of military carriage,\nand he has one of those perfect oval faces that you sometimes see. He\nhas most remarkable black eyes and very neat, thin eyebrows. He is the\nsort of man you'd turn round to look at if you once passed him in the\nstreet; and if you once saw him smile you'd begin to like him. It's the\nprettiest thing I've ever seen.\"\n\n\"I expect I'll run across him somewhere,\" said Lewis, \"and I want badly\nto know him. Would you mind giving me an introduction?\"\n\n\"Charmed!\" said Gribton. \"Shall I write it now?\" And sitting down at a\ntable he scribbled a few lines, put them in an envelope, and gave it to\nLewis.\n\n\"You are pretty certain to know him when you see him, so you can give\nhim that line. You might run across him anywhere from Hyderabad to\nRawal Pinch, and in any case you'll hear word of him in Bardur. He's\nthe man for your purpose; only, as I say, I never liked him. I suspect\na loop somewhere.\"\n\n\"What are Logan and Thwaite like?\" Lewis asked.\n\n\"Easy-going, good fellows. Believe in God and the British Government,\nand the inherent goodness of man. I am rather the other way, so they\ncall me a cynic and an alarmist.\"\n\n\"But what do you fear?\" said George. \"The place is well garrisoned.\"\n\n\"I fear four inches in that map of unknown country,\" said Gribton\nshortly. \"The people up there call it a 'God-given rock-wall,' and of\ncourse there is no force to speak of just near it. But a tribe of\ndevils incarnate, who call themselves the Bada-Mawidi, live on its\nskirts, and there must be a road through it. It isn't the caravan\nroute, which goes much farther east and is plain enough. But I know\nenough of the place to know that every man who comes over the frontier\nto Bardur does not come by the high-road.\"\n\n\"But what could happen? Surely Bardur is strongly garrisoned enough to\nblock any secret raid.\"\n\n\"It isn't bad in its way, if the people were not so slack and easy.\nThey might rise to scratch, but, on the other hand, they might not, and\nonce past Bardur you have the open road to India, if you march quick\nenough.\"\n\n\"Then you have no man sufficiently adventurous there to do a little\nexploring?\"\n\n\"None. They care only about shooting, and there happens to be little in\nthose rocks. Besides, they trust in God and the Government of India. I\ndidn't, so I became unpopular, and was voted a bore. But the work is\nwaiting for you young men.\"\n\nGribton rose, yawned, and stretched himself. \"Shall I tell you any\nmore?\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" said Lewis, smiling; \"I fancy I understand, and I am\nsure we are obliged to you. Hadn't we better have a game?\"\n\nThey went to the billiard-room and played two games of a hundred up,\nboth of which George, who had the idler's knack in such matters, won\nwith ease. Gribton played so well that he became excessively\ngood-humoured.\n\n\"I almost wish I was going out again if I had you two as company. We\ndon't get the right sort out there. Our globe-trotters all want to show\ntheir cleverness, or else they are merely fools. You will find it\nmiserably dull. Nothing but bad claret and cheap champagne at the\nclubs, a cliquey set of English residents, and the sort of stock sport\nof which you tire in a month. That's what you may expect our frontier\ntowns to be like.\"\n\n\"And the neighbourhood?\" said Lewis, with lifted eyebrows.\n\n\"Oh, the neighbourhood is wonderful enough; but our people there are too\nslack and stale to take advantage of it. It is a peaceful frontier, you\nknow, and men get into a rut as easily there as elsewhere. The\ncountry's too fat and wealthy, and people begin to forget the skeleton\nup among the rocks in the north.\"\n\n\"What are the garrisons like?\"\n\n\"Good people, but far too few for a serious row, and just sufficiently\nlarge to have time hang on their hands. Our friends the Bada-Mawidi now\nand then wake them up. I see from the _Temps_ that a great stirring of\nthe tribes in the Southern Pamirs is reported. I expect that news came\noverland through Russia. It's the sort of canard these gentry are\nalways getting up to justify a massing of troops on the Amu Daria in\norder that some new governor may show his strategic skill. I daresay\nyou may find things a little livelier than I found them.\"\n\nAs they went towards the Faubourg St. Honor\u00c3\u00a9 a bitter Paris\nnorth-easter had begun to drift a fine powdered snow in their eyes.\nGribton shivered and turned up the collar of his fur coat. \"Ugh, I\ncan't stand this. It makes me sick to be back. Thank your stars that\nyou are going to the sun and heat, and out of this hideous grey\nweather.\"\n\nThey left him at the Embassy, and turned back to their hotel.\n\n\"He's a useful man,\" said Lewis, \"he has given us a cue; life will be\npretty well varied out there for you and me, I fancy.\"\n\nThen, as they entered a boulevard, and the real sweep of the wind met\ntheir faces, both men fell strangely silent. To George it was the last\nword of the north which they were leaving, and his recent home-sickness\ncame back and silenced him. But to Lewis, his mind already busy with\nhis errand, this sting of wind was the harsh disturber which carried him\nback to a lonely home in a cold, upland valley. It was the wintry\nweather which was his own, and Alice's face, framed in a cloak, as he\nhad seen it at the Broken Bridge, rose in the gallery of his heart. In\na moment he was disillusioned. Success, enterprise, new lands and faces\nseemed the most dismal vexation of spirit. With a very bitter heart he\nwalked home, and, after the fashion of his silent kind, gave no sign of\nhis mood save by a premature and unreasonable retirement to bed.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nIN THE HEART OF THE HILLS\n\n\nAll around was stone and scrub, rising in terraces to the foot of sheer\ncliffs which opened up here and there in nullahs and gave a glimpse of\ngreat snow hills behind them. On one of the flat ridge-tops a little\nvillage of stunted, slaty houses squatted like an ape, with a vigilant\neye on twenty gorges. Thin, twisting paths led up to it, and before, on\nthe more clement slopes, some fields of grain were tilled as our Aryan\nforefathers tilled the soil on the plains of Turkestan. The place was\nat least 8,000 feet above the sea, so the air was highland, clear and\npleasant, save for the dryness which the great stone deserts forced upon\nthe soft south winds. You will not find the place marked in any map,\nfor it is a little beyond even the most recent geographer's ken, but it\nis none the less a highly important place, for the nameless village is\none of the seats of that most active and excellent race of men, the\nBada-Mawidi, who are so old that they can afford to look down on their\nneighbours from a vantage-ground of some thousands of years. It is well\nknown that when God created the earth He first fashioned this tangle of\nhill land, and set thereon a primitive Bada-Mawidi, the first of the\nclan, who was the ancestor, in the thousandth degree, of the excellent\nFazir Khan, the present father of the tribe.\n\nThe houses clustered on the scarp and enclosed a piece of well-beaten\nground and one huge cedar tree. Sounds came from the near houses, but\naround the tree itself the more privileged sat in solemn conclave. Food\nand wine were going the round, for the Maulai Mohammedans have no taboos\nin eating and drinking. Fazir Khan sat smoking next the tree trunk, a\nshort, sinewy man with a square, Aryan face, clear-cut and cruel. His\nchiefs were around him, all men of the same type, showing curiously fair\nskins against their oiled black hair. A mullah sat cross-legged, his\nstraggling beard in his lap, repeating some crazy charm to himself and\nlooking every now and again with anxious eyes to the guest who sat on\nthe chief's right hand.\n\nThe guest was a long, thin man, clad in the Cossacks' fur lined military\ncloak, under which his untanned riding-boots showed red in the\nmoonlight. He was still busy eating goat's flesh, cheese and fruits,\nand drinking deeply from the sweet Hunza wine, like a man who had come\nfar and fast. He ate with the utmost disregard of his company. He\nmight have been a hunter supping alone in the solitary hills for all the\nnotice he took of the fifty odd men around him.\n\nBy and by he finished, pulled forth a little silver toothpick from an\ninner pocket, and reached a hand for the long cherry-wood pipe which had\nbeen placed beside him. He lit it, and blew a few clouds into the calm\nair.\n\n\"Now, Fazir Khan,\" he said, \"I am a new man, and we shall talk. First,\nhave you done my bidding?\"\n\n\"Thy bidding has been done,\" said the great man sulkily. \"See, I am\nhere with my chiefs. All the twenty villages of my tribe have been\nwarned, and arms have been got from the fools at Bardur. Also, I have\nthe Yarkand powder I was told of, to give the signals on the hills. The\nNazri Pass road, which we alone know, has been widened. What more could\nman do?\"\n\n\"That is well,\" said the other. \"It is well for you and your people\nthat you have done this. Your service shall not be forgotten.\nOtherwise--\"\n\n\"Otherwise?\" said the Fazir Khan, his hand travelling to his belt at the\nsound of a threat.\n\nThe man laughed. \"You know the tale,\" he said. \"Doubtless your mother\ntold you it when you clutched at her breast. Some day a great white\npeople from the north will come down and swallow up the disobedient.\nThat day is now at hand. You have been wise in time. Therefore I say\nit is well.\"\n\nThe stranger spoke with perfect coolness. He looked round curiously at\nthe circle of dark faces and laughed quietly to himself. The chief\nstole one look at him and then said something to a follower.\n\n\"I need not speak of the reward,\" said the stranger. \"You are our\nservants, and duty is duty. But I have authority for saying that we\nshall hold your work in mind when we have settled our business.\"\n\n\"What would ye be without us?\" said the chief in sudden temper. \"What\ndo ye know of the Nazri gates or the hill country? What is this talk of\nduty, when ye cannot stir a foot without our aid?\"\n\n\"You are our servants, as I said before,\" said the man curtly. \"You\nhave taken our gold and our food. Where would you be, outlaws, vagrants\nthat you are, hated of God and man, but for our help? Your bodies would\nhave rotted long ago on the hills. The kites would be feeding on your\nsons; your women would be in the Bokhara market. We have saved you a\ndozen times from the vengeance of the English. When they wished to come\nup and burn you out, we have put them past the project with smooth\nwords. We have fed you in famine, we have killed your enemies, we have\ngiven you life. You are freemen indeed in the face of the world, but\nyou are our servants.\"\n\nFazir Khan made a gesture of impatience. \"That is as God may direct\nit,\" he said. \"Who are ye but a people of yesterday, while the\nBada-Mawidi is as old as the rocks. The English were here before you,\nand we before the English. It is right that youth should reverence\nage.\"\n\n\"That is one proverb,\" said the man, \"but there are others, and in\nespecial one to the effect that the man without a sword should bow\nbefore his brother who has one. In this game we are the people with the\nsword, my friends.\"\n\nThe hillman shrugged his shoulders. His men looked on darkly, as if\nlittle in love with the stranger's manner of speech.\n\n\"It is ill working in the dark,\" he said at length. \"Ye speak of this\nattack and the aid you expect from us, but we have heard this talk\nbefore. One of your people came down with some followers in my father's\ntime, and his words were the same, but lo! nothing has yet happened.\"\n\n\"Since your father's time things have changed, my brother. Then the\nEnglish were very much on the watch, now they sleep. Then there were no\nroads, or very bad ones, and before an army could reach the plains the\nwhole empire would have been wakened. Now, for their own undoing, they\nhave made roads up to the very foot of yon mountains, and there is a new\nrailway down the Indus through Kohistan waiting to carry us into the\nheart of the Punjab. They seek out inventions for others to enjoy, as\nthe Koran says, and in this case we are to be the enjoyers.\"\n\n\"But what if ye fail?\" said the chief. \"Ye will be penned up in that\nHunza valley like sheep, and I, Fazir Khan, shall be unable to unlock\nthe door of that sheepfold.\"\n\n\"We shall not fail. This is no war of rock-pigeons, my brothers. Our\nagents are in every town and village from Bardur to Lahore. The\nfrontier tribes, you among the rest, are rising in our favour. There is\nnothing to stop us but isolated garrisons of Gurkhas and Pathans, with a\nfew overworked English officers at their head. In a week we shall\ncommand the north of India, and if we hold the north, in another week we\nshall hold Calcutta and Bombay.\"\n\nThe chief nodded his head. Such far-off schemes pleased his fancy, but\nonly remotely touched his interest. Calcutta was beyond his ken, but he\nknew Bardur and Gilgit.\n\n\"I have little love for the race,\" he said. \"They hanged two of my\nservants who ventured too near the rifle-room, and they shot my son in\nthe back when we raided the Chitralis. If ye and your friends cross the\nborder I will be with you. But meantime, till that day, what is my\nduty?\"\n\n\"To wait in patience, and above all things to let the garrisons alone.\nIf we stir up the hive in the valleys they may come and see things too\nsoon for our success. We must win by secrecy and surprise. All is lost\nif we cannot reach the railway before the Punjab is stirring.\"\n\nThe mullah had ceased muttering to himself. He scrambled to his feet,\nshaking down his rags over his knees, a lean, crazy apparition of a man\nwith deep-set, smouldering eyes.\n\n\"I will speak,\" he cried. \"Ye listen to the man's words and ye are\nsilent, believing all things. Ye are silent, my children, because ye\nknow not. But I am old and I have seen many things, and these are my\nwords. Ye speak of pushing out the English from the land. Allah knows\nI love not the breed! I spit upon it, I thirst for the heart of every\nman, woman, and child, that I might burn them in the sight of all of\nyou. But I have heard this talk before. When I was a young priest at\nKufaz, there was word of this pushing out of the foreigner, and I\nrejoiced, being unwise. Then there was much fighting, and at the end\nmore English came up the valleys and, before we knew, we were paying\ntribute. Since then many of our people have gone down from the\nmountains with the same thought, and they have never returned. Only the\nEnglish and the troops have crept nearer. Now this stranger talks of\nhis Tsar and how an army will come through the passes, and foreigner\nwill fight with foreigner. This talk, too, I have heard. Once there\ncame a man with a red beard who spoke thus, and he went down to Bardur,\nand lo! our men told me that they saw him hanged there for a warning.\nLet foreigner war on foreigner if they please, but what have we to do in\nthe quarrel, my children? Ye owe nothing to either.\"\n\nThe stranger regarded the speaker with calm eyes of amusement.\n\n\"Nothing,\" said he, \"except that we have fed you and armed you. By your\nown acts you are the servants of my master.\"\n\nThe mullah was rapidly working himself into a frenzy. He swung his long\nbony arms across his breast and turned his face skywards. \"Ye hear\nthat, my children. The free people, the Bada-Mawidi, of whose loins\nsprang Abraham the prophet, are the servants of some foreign dog in the\nnorth. If ye were like your fathers, ye would have long ago ere this\nwiped out the taunt in blood.\"\n\nThe man sat perfectly composed, save that his right hand had grasped a\nrevolver. He was playing a bold game, but he had played it before. And\nhe knew the man he had to deal with.\n\n\"I say again, you are my master's servants by your own confession. I\ndid not say his slaves. You are a free people, but you will serve a\ngreater in this affair. As for this dog who blasphemes, when we have\nsettled more important matters we will attend to him.\"\n\nThe mullah was scarcely a popular member of his tribe, for no one\nstirred at the call. The stranger sat watching him with very bright,\neager eyes. Suddenly the priest ceased his genuflexions, there was a\ngleam of steel among his rags, then something bright flashed in the air.\nIt fell short, because at the very moment of throwing, a revolver had\ncracked out in the silence, and a bullet had broken two of his fingers.\nThe man flung himself writhing on the ground, howling forth\nimprecations.\n\nThe stranger looked half apologetically at the chief, whose glum\ndemeanour had never relaxed. \"Sorry,\" he said; \"it had to be done in\nself-defence. But I ask your pardon for it.\"\n\nFazir Khan nodded carelessly. \"He is a disturber of peace, and to one\nwho cannot fight a hand matters little. But, by Allah, ye northerners\nshoot quick.\"\n\nThe stranger relinquished the cherry-wood pipe and filled a meerschaum\nfrom a pouch which he carried in the pocket of his cloak. He took a\nlong drink from the loving-cup of mulled wine which was passing round.\n\n\"Your mad priest has method in his folly,\" he said. \"It is true that we\nare attacking a great people; therefore the more need of wariness for\nyou and me, Fazir Khan. If we fail there will be the devil to pay for\nyou. The English will shift their frontier-line beyond the mountains,\nand there will be no more lifting of women and driving of cattle for the\nBada-Mawidi. You will all be sent to school, and your guns will be\ntaken from you.\"\n\nThe chief compressed his attractive features into a savage scowl. \"That\nmay not be in my lifetime,\" he said. \"Besides, are there no mountains\nall around? In five hours I shall be in China, and in a little more I\nmight be beyond the Amu. But why talk of this? The accursed English\nshall not escape us, I swear by the hilt of my sword and the hearts of\nmy fathers.\"\n\nA subdued murmur of applause ran around the circle.\n\n\"You are men after my own heart,\" said the stranger. \"Meanwhile, a word\nin your own ear, Fazir Khan. Dare you come to Bardur with me?\"\n\nThe chief made a gesture of repugnance. \"I hate that place of mud and\nlime. The blood of my people cries on me when I enter the gates. But\nif it is your counsel I will come with you.\"\n\n\"I wish to assure myself that the place is quiet. Our success depends\nupon the whole country being unsuspicious and asleep. Now if word has\ngot to the south, and worse still to England, there will be questions\nasked and vague instructions sent up to the frontier. We shall find a\nstir among the garrisons, and perhaps some visitors in the place. And\nat the very worst we might find some fool inquiring about the Nazri\nPass. There was once a man in Bardur who did, but people laughed at him\nand he has gone.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked the chief.\n\n\"To England. But he was a harmless man, and he is too old to have any\nvigour.\"\n\nAs the darkness grew over the hills the fires were brightened and the\ncurious game of _khoti_ was played in groups of six. The women came to\nthe house-doors to sit and gossip, and listened to the harsh laughter of\ntheir lords from beside the fires. A little after midnight, when the\nstars were picked out in the deep, velvet sky, Fazir Khan and the\nstranger, both muffled to the ears, stole beyond the street and\nscrambled down the perilous path-ways to the south.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTHE OUTPOSTS\n\n\nTowards the close of a wet afternoon two tongas discharged Lewis,\nGeorge, two native servants, and a collection of gun-cases in the\ncourt-yard of the one hotel in Bardur. They had made a record journey\nup country, stopping to present no letters of introduction, which are\nthe thieves of time. Now, as Lewis found himself in the strait valley,\nwith the eternal snows where the sky should be, and sniffed the dry air\nfrom the granite walls, he glowed with the pleasure of recollection.\n\nThe place was the same as ever. The same medley of races perambulated\nthe streets. Sheep-skinned Central Asians and Mongolian merchants from\nYarkand still displayed their wares and their cunning; Hunza tribesmen,\nhalf-clad Chitralis, wild-eyed savages from Yagistan mingled in the\nnarrow stone streets with the civilized Persian and Turcoman from beyond\nthe mountains. Kashmir sepoys, an untidy race, still took their ease in\nthe sun, and soldiers of South India from the Imperial Service Troops\nshowed their odd accoutrements and queer race mixtures. The place\nlooked and smelled like a kind of home, and Lewis, with one eye on the\ngun-cases and one on the great hills, forgot his heart-sickness and had\nleisure for the plain joys of expectation.\n\n\"I am going to get to work at once,\" he said, when he had washed the\ndust out of his eyes and throat. \"I shall go and call on the Logans\nthis very minute, and I expect we shall see Thwaite and some of the\nsoldiers at the club to-night.\" So George, much against his will, was\ncompelled to don a fresh suit and suffer himself to be conducted to the\nbungalow of the British Resident.\n\nThe Sahib was from home, at Gilgit, but Madame would receive the\nstrangers. So the two found themselves in a drawing-room aggressively\nEnglish in its air, shaking hands with a small woman with kind eyes and\na washed-out complexion.\n\nMrs. Logan was unaffectedly glad to see them. She had that trick of\ndominating her surroundings which English ladies seem to bear to the\nuttermost ends of the globe. There, in that land of snows and rock,\nwith savage tribesmen not thirty miles away, and the British\nfrontier-line something less than fifty, she gave them tea and talked\nsmall talk with the ease and gusto of an English country home.\n\n\"It's the most unfortunate thing in the world,\" she cried. \"If you had\nonly wired, Gilbert would have stayed, but as it is he has gone down to\nGilgit about some polo ponies, and won't be back for two days. Things\nare so humdrum and easy-going up here that one loses interest in one's\nprofession. Gilbert has nothing to do except arrange with the foreman\nof the coolies who are making roads, and hold stupid courts, and consult\nwith Captain Thwaite and the garrison people. The result is that the\npoor man has become crazy about golf, and wastes all his spare money on\npolo ponies. You can have no idea what a godsend a new face is to us\npoor people. It is simply delightful to see you again, Mr. Haystoun.\nYou left us about sixteen months ago, didn't you? Did you enjoy going\nback?\"\n\nLewis said yes, with an absurd sense of the humour of the question. The\nlady talked as if home had been merely an interlude, instead of the\ncrisis of his life.\n\n\"And what did you do? And whom did you see? Please tell me, for I am\ndying for a gossip.\"\n\n\"I have been home in Scotland, you know. Looking after my affairs and\nidling. I stood for Parliament and got beaten.\"\n\n\"Really! How exciting! Where is your home in Scotland, Mr. Haystoun?\nYou told me once, but I have forgotten. You know I have no end of\nScotch relatives.\"\n\n\"It's in rather a remote part, a place called Etterick, in Glenavelin.\"\n\n\"Glenavelin, Glenavelin,\" the lady repeated. \"That's where the\nManorwaters live, isn't it?\"\n\n\"My uncle,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"I had a letter from a friend who was staying there in the summer. I\nwonder if you ever met her. A Miss Wishart. Alice Wishart?\"\n\nLewis strove to keep any extraordinary interest out of his eyes. This\nvoice from another world had broken rudely in upon his new composure.\n\n\"I knew her,\" he said, and his tone was of such studied carelessness\nthat Mrs. Logan looked up at him curiously.\n\n\"I hope you liked her, for her mother was a relation of my husband, and\nwhen I have been home the small Alice has always been a great friend of\nmine. I wonder if she has grown pretty. Gilbert and I used to bet\nabout it on different sides. I said she would be very beautiful some\nday.\"\n\n\"She is very beautiful,\" said Lewis in a level voice, and George,\nfeeling the thin ice, came to his friend's rescue. He could at least\ntalk naturally of Miss Wishart.\n\n\"The Wisharts took the place, you know, Mrs. Logan, so we saw a lot of\nthem. The girl was delightful, good sportswoman and all that sort of\nthing, and capital company. I wonder she never told us about you. She\nknew we were coming out here, for I told her, and she was very\ninterested.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's odd, for I suppose she had read Mr. Haystoun's book, where\nmy husband comes in a good deal. I shall tell her about seeing you in\nmy next letter. And now tell me your plans.\"\n\nLewis's face had begun to burn in a most compromising way. Those last\ndays in Glenavelin had risen again before the eye of his mind and old\nwounds were reopened. The thought that Alice was not yet wholly out of\nhis life, that the new world was not utterly severed from the old,\naffected him with a miserable delight. Mrs. Logan became invested with\nan extraordinary interest. He pulled himself together to answer her\nquestion.\n\n\"Oh, our errand is much the same as last time. We want to get all the\nsport we can, and if possible to cross the mountains into Turkestan. I\nam rather keen on geographical work just now, and there's a bit of land\nup here which wants exploring.\"\n\nThe lady laughed. \"That sounds like poor dear Mr. Gribton. I suppose\nyou remember him? He left here in the summer, but when he lived in\nBardur he had got that northern frontier-line on the brain. He was a\nhorrible bore, for he would always work the conversation round to it\nsooner or later. I think it was really Mr. Gribton who made people\noften lose interest in these questions. They had to assume an indolent\nattitude in pure opposition to his fussiness.\"\n\n\"When will your husband be home?\" Lewis asked.\n\n\"In two days, or possibly three. I am so sorry about it. I'll wire at\nonce, but it's a slow journey, especially if he is bringing ponies. Of\ncourse you want to see him before you start. It's such a pity, but\nBardur is fearfully empty of men just now. Captain Thwaite has gone off\nafter ibex, and though I think he will be back to-morrow, I am afraid he\nwill be too late for my dance. Oh, really, this is lucky. I had\nforgotten all about it. Of course you two will come. That will make\ntwo more men, and we shall be quite a respectable party. We are having\na dance to-morrow night, and as the English people here are so few and\nuncertain in their movements we can't afford to miss a chance. You\n_must_ come. I've got the Thwaites and the Beresfords and the Waltons,\nand some of the garrison people who are down on leave. Oh, and there's\na man coming whom you must know. A Mr. Marker, a most delightful\nperson. I don't think you met him before, but you must have heard my\nhusband talk about him. He is the very man for your purpose. Gilbert\nsays he knows the hills better than any of the Hunza tribesmen, and that\nhe is the best sportsman he ever met. Besides, he is such an\ninteresting person, very much a man of the world, you know, who has been\neverywhere and knows everybody.\"\n\nLewis congratulated himself on his luck. \"I should like very much to\ncome to the dance, and I especially want to meet Mr. Marker.\"\n\n\"He is half Scotch, too,\" said the lady. \"His mother was a Kirkpatrick\nor some name like that, and he actually seems to talk English with a\nkind of Scotch accent. Of course that may be the German part of him.\nHe is a Pomeranian count or something of the sort, and very rich. You\nmight get him to go with you into the hills.\"\n\n\"I wish we could,\" said Lewis falsely. His curiosity was keenly\nexcited.\n\n\"Why does he come up here such a lot?\" George asked.\n\n\"I suppose because he likes to 'knock about,' as you call it. He is a\ntremendous traveller. He has been into Tibet and all over Turkestan and\nPersia. Gilbert says that he is the wonder of the age.\"\n\n\"Is he here just now?\"\n\n\"No, I don't think so. I know he is coming to-morrow, because he wrote\nme about it, and promised to come to my dance. But he is a very busy\nman, so I don't suppose he will arrive till just before. He wrote me\nfrom Gilgit, so he may find Gilbert there and bring him up with him.\"\n\nMarker, Marker. The air seemed full of the strange name. Lewis saw\nagain Wratislaw's wrinkled face when he talked of him, and remembered\nhis words. \"You were within an ace of meeting one of the cleverest men\nliving, a cheerful being in whom the Foreign Office is more interested\nthan in any one else in the world.\" Wratislaw had never been in the\nhabit of talking without good authority. This Marker must be indeed a\ngentleman of parts.\n\nThen conversation dwindled. Lewis, his mind torn between bitter\nmemories and the pressing necessities of his mission, lent a stupid ear\nto Mrs. Logan's mild complaints, her gossip about Bardur, her eager\nquestions about home. George manfully took his place, and by a\nfortunate clumsiness steered the flow of the lady's talk from Glenavelin\nand the Wisharts. Lewis spoke now and then, when appealed to, but he\nwas busy thinking out his own problem. On the morrow night he should\nmeet Marker, and his work would reveal itself. Meanwhile he was in the\ndark, the flimsiest adventurer on the wildest of errands. This easy,\nsettled place, these Englishmen whose minds held fast by polo and games,\nthese English ladies who had no thought beyond little social devices to\nrelieve the monotony of the frontier, all seemed to make a mockery of\nhis task. He had fondly imagined himself going to a certainty of toil\nand danger; to his vexation this certainty seemed to be changing into\nthe most conventional of visits to the most normal of places. But\nto-morrow he should see Marker; and his hope revived at the prospect.\n\n\"It is so pleasant seeing two fresh fellow-countrymen,\" Mrs. Logan was\nsaying. \"Do you know, you two people look quite different from our men\nup here. They are all so dried up and tired out. Our complexions are\nall gone, and our eyes have got that weariness of the sun in them which\nnever goes away even when we go home again. But you two look quite keen\nand fresh and enthusiastic. You mustn't mind compliments from an old\nwoman, but I wish our own people looked as nice as you. You will make\nus all homesick.\"\n\nA native servant entered, more noiseless and more dignified than any\nEnglish footman, and announced another visitor. Lewis lifted his head,\nand saw the lady rise, smiling, to greet a tall man who had come in with\nthe frankness of a privileged acquaintance. \"How do you do, Mr.\nMarker?\" he heard. \"I am so glad to see you. We didn't dare to expect\nyou till to-morrow. May I introduce two English friends, Mr. Haystoun\nand Mr. Winterham?\"\n\nAnd so the meeting came about in the simplest way. Lewis found himself\nshaking hands cordially with a man who stood upright, quite in the\nEnglish fashion, and smiled genially on the two strangers. Then he took\nthe vacant chair by Mrs. Logan, and answered the lady's questions with\nthe ease and kindliness of one who knows and likes his fellow-creatures.\nHe deplored Logan's absence, grew enthusiastic about the dance, and\nproduced from a pocket certain sweetmeats, not made in Kashmir, for the\ntwo children. Then he turned to George and asked pleasantly about the\njourney. How did they find the roads from Gilgit? He hoped they would\nget good sport, and if he could be of any service, would they command\nhim? He had heard of Lewis's former visit, and, of course, he had read\nhis book. The most striking book of travel he had seen for long. Of\ncourse he didn't agree with certain things, but each man for his own\nview; and he should like to talk over the matter with Mr. Haystoun.\nWere they staying long? At Galetti's of course? By good luck that was\nalso his headquarters. And so he talked pleasingly, in the style of a\nlady's drawing-room, while Lewis, his mind consumed with interest, sat\npuzzling out the discords in his face.\n\n\"Do you know, Mr. Marker, we were talking about you before you came in.\nI was telling Mr. Haystoun that I thought you were half Scotch. Mr.\nHaystoun, you know, lives in Scotland.\"\n\n\"Do you really? Then I am a thousand times delighted to meet you, for I\nhave many connections with Scotland. My grandmother was a Scotswoman,\nand though I have never been in your beautiful land, yet I have known\nmany of your people. And, indeed, I have heard of one of your name who\nwas a friend of my father's--a certain Mr. Haystoun of Etterick.\"\n\n\"My father,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"Ah, I am so pleased to hear. My father and he met often in Paris, when\nthey were attached to their different embassies. My father was in the\nGerman service.\"\n\n\"Your mother was Russian, was she not?\" Lewis asked tactlessly, impelled\nby he knew not what motive.\n\n\"Ah, how did you know?\" Mr. Marker smiled in reply, with the slightest\nraising of the eyebrows. \"I have indeed the blood of many nationalities\nin my veins. Would that I were equally familiar with all nations, for I\nknow less of Russia than I know of Scotland. We in Germany are their\nnear neighbours, and love them, as you do here, something less than\nourselves.\"\n\nHe talked English with that pleasing sincerity which seems inseparable\nfrom the speech of foreigners, who use a purer and more formal idiom\nthan ourselves. George looked anxiously towards Lewis, with a question\nin his eyes, but finding his companion abstracted, he spoke himself.\n\n\"I have just arrived,\" said the other simply; \"but it was from a\ndifferent direction. I have been shooting in the hills, getting cool\nair into my lungs after the valleys. Why, Mrs. Logan, I have been down\nto Rawal Pindi since I saw you last, and have been choked with the sun.\nWe northerners do not take kindly to glare and dust.\"\n\n\"But you are an old hand here, they tell me. I wish you'd show me the\nropes, you know. I'm very keen, but as ignorant as a babe. What sort\nof rifles do they use here? I wish you'd come and look at my\nironmongery.\" And George plunged into technicalities.\n\nWhen Lewis rose to leave, following unwillingly the convention which\nforbids a guest to stay more than five minutes after a new visitor has\narrived, Marker crossed the room with them. \"If you're not engaged for\nto-night, Mr. Haystoun, will you do me the honour to dine with me? I\nam alone, and I think we might manage to find things to talk about.\"\nLewis accepted gladly, and with one of his sweetest smiles the gentleman\nreturned to Mrs. Logan's side.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nTHE DINNER AT GALETTI'S\n\n\n\"I have heard of you so much,\" Mr. Marker said, \"and it was a lucky\nchance which brought me to Bardur to meet you.\" They had taken their\ncigars out to the verandah, and were drinking the strong Persian coffee,\nwith a prospect before them of twinkling town lights, and a mountain\nline of rock and snow. Their host had put on evening clothes and wore a\nbraided dinner-jacket which gave the faintest touch of the foreigner to\nhis appearance. At dinner he had talked well of a score of things. He\nhad answered George's questions on sport with the readiness of an\nexpert; he had told a dozen good stories, and in an easy, pleasant way\nhe had gossiped of books and places, people and politics. His knowledge\nstruck both men as uncanny. Persons of minute significance in\nParliament were not unknown to him, and he was ready with a theory or an\nexplanation on the most recondite matters. But coffee and cigars found\nhim a different man. He ceased to be the enthusiast, the omnivorous and\nversatile inquirer, and relapsed into the ordinary good fellow, who is\nno cleverer than his neighbours.\n\n\"We're confoundedly obliged to you,\" said George. \"Haystoun is keen\nenough, but when he was out last time he seems to have been very slack\nabout the sport.\"\n\n\"Sort of student of frontier peoples and politics, as the newspapers\ncall it. I fancy that game is, what you say, 'played out' a little\nnowadays. It is always a good cry for alarmist newspapers to send up\ntheir circulation by, but you and I, my friend, who have mixed with\nserious politicians, know its value.\"\n\nGeorge nodded. He liked to be considered a person of importance, and he\nwanted the conversation to get back to ibex.\n\n\"I speak as of a different nation,\" Marker said, looking towards Lewis.\n\"But I find the curse of modern times is this mock-seriousness. Some\ncenturies ago men and women were serious about honour and love and\nreligion. Nowadays we are frivolous and sceptical about these things,\nbut we are deadly in earnest about fads. Plans to abolish war, schemes\nto reform criminals, and raise the condition of woman, and supply the\nBada-Mawidi with tooth-picks are sure of the most respectful treatment\nand august patronage.\"\n\n\"I agree,\" said Lewis. \"The Bada-Mawidi live there?\" And he pointed to\nthe hill line.\n\nMarker nodded. He had used the name inadvertently as an illustration,\nand he had no wish to answer questions on the subject.\n\n\"A troublesome tribe, rather?\" asked Lewis, noticing the momentary\nhesitation.\n\n\"In the past. Now they are quiet enough.\"\n\n\"But I understood that there was a ferment in the Pamirs. The other\nside threatened, you know.\" He had almost said \"your side,\" but checked\nhimself.\n\n\"Ah yes, there are rumours of a rising, but that is further west. The\nBada-Mawidi are too poor to raise two swords in the whole tribe. You\nwill come across them if you go north, and I can recommend them as\nexcellent beaters.\"\n\n\"Is the north the best shooting quarter?\" asked Lewis with sharp eyes.\n\"I am just a little keen on some geographical work, and if I can join\nboth I shall be glad. Due north is the Russian frontier?\n\n\"Due north after some scores of the most precipitous miles in the world.\nIt is a preposterous country. I myself have been on the verge of it,\nand know it as well as most. The geographical importance, too, is\nabsurdly exaggerated. It has never been mapped because there is nothing\nabout it to map, no passes, no river, no conspicuous mountain, nothing\nbut desolate, unvaried rock. The pass to Yarkand goes to the east, and\nthe Afghan routes are to the west. But to the north you come to a wall,\nand if you have wings you may get beyond it. The Bada-Mawidi live in\nsome of the wretched nullahs. There is sport, of course, of a kind, but\nnot perhaps the best. I should recommend you to try the more easterly\nhills.\"\n\nThe speaker's manner was destitute of all attempt to dissuade, and yet\nLewis felt in some remote way that this man was trying to dissuade him.\nThe rock-wall, the Bada-Mawidi, whatever it was, something existed\nbetween Bardur and the Russian frontier which this pleasant gentleman\ndid not wish him to see.\n\n\"Our plans are all vague,\" he said, \"and of course we are glad of your\nadvice.\"\n\n\"And I am glad to give it, though in many ways you know the place better\nthan I do. Your book is the work of a very clever and observant man, if\nyou will excuse my saying so. I was thankful to find that you were not\nthe ordinary embryo-publicist who looks at the frontier hills from\nBardur, and then rushes home and talks about invasion.\"\n\n\"You think there is no danger, then?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I honestly think that there is danger, but from a\ndifferent direction. Britain is getting sick, and when she is sick\nenough, some people who are less sick will overwhelm her. My own\nopinion is that Russia will be the people.\"\n\n\"But is not that one of the old cries that you object to?\" and Lewis\nsmiled.\n\n\"It was; now it is ceasing to be a cry, and passing into a fact, or as\nmuch a fact as that erroneous form of gratuity, prophecy, can be. Look\nat Western Europe and you cannot disbelieve the evidence of your own\neyes. In France you have anarchy, the vulgarest frivolity and the\ncheapest scepticism, joined with a sort of dull capacity for routine\nwork. Germany, the very heart of it eaten out with sentiment, either\nthe cheap military or the vague socialist brand. Spain and Italy\nshadows, Denmark and Sweden farces, Turkey a sinful anachronism.\"\n\n\"And Britain?\" George asked.\n\n\"My Scotch blood gives me the right to speak my mind,\" said the man,\nlaughing. \"Honestly I don't find things much better in Britain. You\nwere always famous for a dogged common sense which was never tricked\nwith catch-words, and yet the British people seem to be growing nervous\nand ingenuous. The cult of abstract ideals, which has been the curse of\nthe world since Adam, is as strong with you as elsewhere. The\nphilosophy of 'gush' is good enough in its place, but it is the devil in\npolitics.\"\n\n\"That is true enough,\" said Lewis solemnly. \"And then you are losing\ngrip. A belief in sentiment means a disbelief in competence and\nstrength, and that is the last and fatalest heresy. And a belief in\nsentiment means a foolish scepticism towards the great things of life.\nThere is none of the blood and bone left for honest belief. You hold\nyour religion half-heartedly. Honest fanaticism is a thing intolerable\nto you. You are all mild, rational sentimentalists, and I would not\ngive a ton of it for an ounce of good prejudice.\" George and Lewis\nlaughed.\n\n\"And Russia?\" they asked.\n\n\"Ah, there I have hope. You have a great people, uneducated and\nunspoiled. They are physically strong, and they have been trained by\ncenturies of serfdom to discipline and hardships. Also, there is fire\nsmouldering somewhere. You must remember that Russia is the\nstepdaughter of the East. The people are northern in the truest sense,\nbut they have a little of Eastern superstition. A rational, sentimental\npeople live in towns or market gardens, like your English country, but\ngreat lonely plains and forests somehow do not agree with that sort of\ncreed. That slow people can still believe freshly and simply, and some\nday when the leader arrives they will push beyond their boundaries and\nsweep down on Western Europe, as their ancestors did thirteen hundred\nyears ago. And you have no walls of Rome to resist them, and I do not\nthink you will find a Charlemagne. Good heavens! What can your\nlatter-day philosophic person, who weighs every action and believes only\nin himself, do against an unwearied people with the fear of God in their\nhearts? When that day comes, my masters, we shall have a new empire,\nthe Holy Eastern Empire, and this rotten surface civilization of ours\nwill be swept off. It is always the way. Men get into the habit of\nbelieving that they can settle everything by talk, and fancy themselves\nthe arbiters of the world, and then suddenly the great man arrives, your\nCaesar or Cromwell, and clears out the talkers.\"\n\n\"I've heard something like that before. In fact, on occasions I have\nsaid it myself. It's a pretty idea. How long do you give this\n_Volkerwanderung_ to get started?\"\n\n\"It will not be in our time,\" said the man sadly. \"I confess I am\nrather anxious for it to come off. Europe is a dull place at present,\ngiven up to Jews and old women. But I am an irreclaimable wanderer, and\nit is some time since I have been home. Things may be already\nchanging.\"\n\n\"Scarcely,\" said Lewis. \"And meantime where is this Slav invasion going\nto begin? I suppose they will start with us here, before they cross the\nChannel?\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly. But Britain is the least sick of the crew, so she may be\nleft in peace till the confirmed invalids are destroyed. At the best it\nwill be a difficult work. Our countrymen, you will permit the name, my\nfriends, have unexpected possibilities in their blood. And even this\nIndia will be a hard nut to crack. It is assumed that Russia has but to\nfind Britain napping, buy a passage from the more northerly tribes, and\nsweep down on the Punjab. I need not tell you how impossible such a\nland invasion is. It is my opinion that when the time comes the attack\nwill be by sea from some naval base on the Persian Gulf. It is a mere\nmatter of time till Persia is the Tsar's territory, and then they may\nbegin to think about invasion.\"\n\n\"You think the northern road impossible! I suppose you ought to know.\"\n\n\"I do, and I have some reason for my opinion. I know Afghanistan and\nChitral as few Europeans know it.\"\n\n\"But what about Bardur, and this Kashmir frontier? I can understand the\ndifficulties of the Khyber, but this Kashmir road looks promising.\"\n\nMarker laughed a great, good-humoured, tolerant, incredulous laugh. \"My\ndear sir, that's the most utter nonsense. How are you to bring an army\nover a rock wall which a chamois hunter could scarcely climb? An\ninvading army is not a collection of winged fowl. I grant you Bardur is\na good starting-point if it were once reached. But you might as well\nthink of a Chinese as of a Russian invasion from the north. It would be\na good deal more possible, for there is a road to Yarkand, and\nrespectable passes to the north-east. But here we are shut off from the\nOxus by as difficult a barrier as the Elburz. Go up and see. There is\nsome shooting to be had, and you will see for yourself the sort of\ncountry between here and Taghati.\"\n\n\"But people come over here sometimes.\"\n\n\"Yes, from the south, or by Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"Not always. What about the Korabaut Pass into Chitral? Ianoff and the\nCossacks came through it.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" said the man, as if in deep thought. \"I had forgotten,\nbut the band was small and the thing was a real adventure.\"\n\n\"And then you have Gromchevtsky. He brought his people right down\nthrough the Pamirs.\"\n\nFor a second the man's laughing ease deserted him. He leaned his head\nforward and peered keenly into Lewis's face. Then, as if to cover his\ndiscomposure, he fell into the extreme of bluff amusement. The\nexaggeration was plain to both his hearers.\n\n\"Oh yes, there was poor old Gromchevtsky. But then you know he was what\nyou call 'daft,' and one never knew how much to believe. He had hatred\nof the English on the brain, and he went about the northern valleys\nmaking all sorts of wild promises on the part of the Tsar. A great\nRussian army was soon to come down from the hills and restore the\nvalleys to their former owners. And then, after he had talked all this\nnonsense, and actually managed to create some small excitement among the\ntribesmen, the good fellow disappeared. No man knows where he went.\nThe odd thing is that I believe he has never been heard of again in\nRussia to this day. Of course his mission, as he loved to call it, was\nperfectly unauthorized, and the man himself was a creature of farce. He\nprobably came either by the Khyber or the Korabaut Pass, possibly even\nby the ordinary caravan-route from Yarkand, but felt it necessary for\nhis mission's sake to pretend he had found some way through the rock\nbarrier. I am afraid I cannot allow him to be taken seriously.\"\n\nLewis yawned and reached out his hand for the cigars. \"In any case it\nis merely a question of speculative interest. We shall not fall just\nyet, though you think so badly of us.\"\n\n\"You will not fall just yet,\" said Marker slowly, \"but that is not your\nfault. You British have sold your souls for something less than the\nconventional mess of pottage. You are ruled in the first place by\nmoney-bags, and the faddists whom they support to blind your eyes. If I\nwere a young man in your country with my future to make, do you know\nwhat I would do? I would slave in the Stock Exchange. I would spend my\ndays and nights in the pursuit of fortune, and, by heaven, I would get\nit. Then I would rule the market and break, crush, quietly and\nruthlessly, the whole gang of Jew speculators and vulgarians who would\ncorrupt a great country. Money is power with you, and I should attain\nit, and use it to crush the leeches who suck our blood.\"\n\n\"Good man,\" said George, laughing. \"That's my way of thinking. Never\nheard it better put.\"\n\n\"I have felt the same,\" said Lewis. \"When I read of 'rings' and\n'corners' and 'trusts' and the misery and vulgarity of it all, I have\noften wished to have a try myself, and see whether average brains and\nclean blood could not beat these fellows on their own ground.\"\n\n\"Then why did you not?\" asked Marker. \"You were rich enough to make a\nproper beginning.\"\n\n\"I expect I was too slack. I wanted to try the thing, but there was so\nmuch that was repulsive that I never quite got the length of trying.\nBesides, I have a bad habit of seeing both sides of a question. The\nordinary arguments seemed to me weak, and it was too much fag to work\nout an attitude for oneself.\"\n\nMarker looked sharply at Lewis, and George for a moment saw and\ncontrasted the two faces. Lewis's keen, kindly, humorous, cultured,\nwith strong lines ending weakly, a face over-bred, brave and finical;\nthe other's sharp, eager, with the hungry wolf-like air of ambition,\nevery line graven in steel, and the whole transfused, as it were, by the\nfire of the eyes into the living presentment of human vigour.\n\nIt was the eternal contrast of qualities, and for a moment in George's\nmind there rose a delight that two such goodly pieces of manhood should\nhave found a meeting-ground.\n\n\"I think, you know, that we are not quite so bad as you make out,\" said\nLewis quietly. \"To an outsider we must appear on the brink of\nincapacity, but then it is not the first time we have produced that\nimpression. You will still find men who in all their spiritual sickness\nhave kept something of that restless, hard-bitten northern energy, and\nthat fierce hunger for righteousness, which is hard to fight with.\nScores of people, who can see no truth in the world and are sick with\ndoubt and introspection and all the latter-day devils, have yet\nsomething of pride and honour in their souls which will make them show\nwell at the last. If we are going to fall our end will not be quite\ninglorious.\"\n\nMarker laughed and rose. \"I am afraid I must leave you now. I have to\nsee my servant, for I am off to-morrow. This has been a delightful\nmeeting. I propose that we drink to its speedy repetition.\"\n\nThey drank, clinking glasses in continental fashion, and the host shook\nhands and departed.\n\n\"Good chap,\" was George's comment. \"Put us up to a wrinkle or two, and\nseemed pretty sound in his politics. I wish I could get him to come and\nstop with me at home. Do you think we shall run across him again?\"\n\nLewis was looking at the fast vanishing lights of the town. \"I should\nthink it highly probable,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nTHE TACTICS OF A CHIEF\n\n\nThere is another quarter in Bardur besides the English one. Down by the\nstream side there are narrow streets built on the scarp of the rock,\nhovels with deep rock cellars, and a wonderful amount of cubic space\nbeneath the brushwood thatch. There the trader from Yarkand who has\ncontraband wares to dispose of may hold a safe market. And if you were\nto go at nightfall into this quarter, where the foot of the Kashmir\npoliceman rarely penetrates, you might find shaggy tribesmen who have\nbeen all their lives outlaws, walking unmolested to visit their friends,\nand certain Jewish gentlemen, members of the great family who have\nconquered the world, engaged in the pursuit of their unlawful calling.\n\nMarker speedily left the broader streets of the European quarter, and\nplunged down a steep alley which led to the stream. Half way down there\nwas a lane to the left in the line of hovels, and, after stopping a\nmoment to consider, he entered this. It was narrow and dark, but smelt\ncleanly enough of the dry granite sand. There were little dark\napertures in the huts, which might have been either doors or windows,\nand at one of these he stopped, lit a match, and examined it closely.\nThe result was satisfactory; for the man, who had hitherto been\ncrouching, straightened himself up and knocked. The door opened\ninstantaneously, and he bowed his tall head to enter a narrow passage.\nThis brought him into a miniature courtyard, about thirty feet across,\nabove which gleamed a patch of violet sky, sown with stars. Below a\ndoor on the right a light shone, and this he pushed open, and entered a\nlittle room.\n\nThe place was richly furnished, with low couches and Persian tables, and\non the floor a bright matting. The short, square-set man sitting\nsmoking on the divan we have already met at a certain village in the\nmountains. Fazir Khan, descendant of Abraham, and father and chief of\nthe Bada-Mawidi, has a nervous eye and an uneasy face to-night, for it\nis a hard thing for a mountaineer, an inhabitant of great spaces, to sit\nwith composure in a trap-like room in the citadel of a foe who has many\nacts of rape and murder to avenge on his body. To do Fazir Khan justice\nhe strove to conceal his restlessness under the usual impassive calm of\nhis race. He turned his head slightly as Marker entered, nodded gravely\nover the bowl of his pipe, and pointed to the seat at the far end of the\ndivan.\n\n\"It is a dark night,\" he said. \"I heard you stumbling on the causeway\nbefore you entered. And I have many miles to cover before dawn.\"\n\nMarker nodded. \"Then you must make haste, my friend. You must be in\nthe hills by daybreak, for I have some errands I want you to do for me.\nI have to-night been dining with two strangers, who have come up from\nthe south.\"\n\nThe chief's eyes sparkled. \"Do they suspect?\"\n\n\"Nothing in particular, everything in general. They are English. One\nwas here before and got far up into your mountains. He wrote a clever\nbook when he returned, which made people think. They say their errand\nis sport, and it may be. On the other hand I have a doubt. One has not\nthe air of the common sportsman. He thinks too much, and his eyes have\na haggard look. It is possible that they are in their Government's\nservices and have come to reconnoitre.\"\n\n\"Then we are lost,\" said Fazir Khan sourly. \"It was always a fool's\nplan, at the mercy of any wandering Englishman.\"\n\n\"Not so,\" said Marker. \"Nothing is lost, and nothing will be lost. But\nI fear these two men. They do not bluster and talk at random like the\nothers. They are so very quiet that they may mean danger.\"\n\n\"They must remain here,\" said the chief. \"Give me the word, and I will\nsend one of my men to hough their horses and, if need be, cripple\nthemselves.\"\n\nMarker laughed. \"You are an honest fool, Fazir Khan. That sort of\nthing is past now. We live in the wrong times and places for it. We\ncannot keep them here, but we must send them on a goose-chase. Do you\nunderstand?\"\n\n\"I understand nothing. I am a simple man and my ways are simple, and\nnot as yours.\"\n\n\"Then attend to my words, my friend. Our expedition must be changed and\nmade two days sooner. That will give these two Englishmen three days\nonly to checkmate it. Besides, they are ignorant, and to-morrow is lost\nto them, for they go to a ball at the Logan woman's. Still, I fear them\nwith two days to work in. If they go north, they are clever and\nsuspicious, and they may see or fancy enough to wreck our plans. They\nmay have the way barred, and we know how little would bar the way.\"\n\n\"Ten resolute men,\" said the chief. \"Nay, I myself, with my two sons,\nwould hold a force at bay there.\"\n\n\"If that is true, how much need is there to be wary beforehand! Since\nwe cannot prevent these men from meddling, we can give them rope to\nmeddle in small matters. Let us assume that they have been sent out by\ntheir Government. They are the common make of Englishmen, worshipping a\ngod which they call their honour. They will do their duty if they can\nfind it out. Now there is but one plan, to create a duty for them which\nwill take them out of the way.\"\n\nThe chief was listening with half-closed eyes. He saw new trouble for\nhimself and was not cheerful.\n\n\"Do you know how many men Holm has with him at the Forza camp?\"\n\n\"A score and a half. Some of my people passed that way yesterday, when\nthe soldiers were parading.\"\n\n\"And there are two more camps?\n\n\"There are two beyond the Nazri Pass, on the fringe of the Doorab hills.\nWe call the places Khautmi-sa and Khautmi-bana, but the English have\ntheir own names for them.\"\n\nMarker nodded.\n\n\"I know the places. They are Gurkha camps. The officers are called\nMitchinson and St. John. They will give us little trouble. But the\nForza garrison is too near the pass for safety, and yet far enough away\nfor my plans.\" And for a moment the man's eyes were abstracted, as if in\ndeep thought.\n\n\"I have another thing to tell of the Forza camp,\" the chief interrupted.\n\"The captain, the man whom they call Holm, is sick, so sick that he\ncannot remain there. He went out shooting and came too near to\ndangerous places, so a bullet of one of my people's guns found his leg.\nHe will be coming to Bardur to-morrow. Is it your wish that he be\nprevented?\n\n\"Let him come,\" said Marker. \"He will suit my purpose. Now I will tell\nyou your task, Fazir Khan, for it is time that you took the road. You\nwill take a hundred of the Bada-Mawidi and put them in the rocks round\nthe Forza camp. Let them fire a few shots but do no great damage, lest\nthis man Holm dare not leave. If I know the man at all, he will only\nhurry the quicker when he hears word of trouble, for he has no stomach\nfor danger, if he can get out of it creditably. So he will come down\nhere to-morrow with a tale of the Bada-Mawidi in arms, and find no men\nin the place to speak of, except these two strangers. I will have\nalready warned them of this intended rising, and if, as I believe, they\nserve the Government, they will let no grass grow below their feet till\nthey get to Forza. Then on the day after let your tribesmen attack the\nplace, not so as to take it, but so as to make a good show of fight and\nkeep the garrison employed. This will keep these young men quiet; they\nwill think that all rumours they may have heard culminate in this rising\nof yours, and they will be content, and satisfied that they have done\ntheir duty. Then, the day after, while they are idling at Forza, we\nwill slip through the passes, and after that there will be no need for\nruses.\"\n\nThe chief rose and pulled himself up to his full height. \"After that,\"\nhe said, \"there will be work for men. God! We shall harry the valleys\nas our forefathers harried them, and we shall suck the juicy plains dry.\nYou will give us a free hand, my lord?\"\n\n\"Your hand shall be free enough,\" said Marker. \"But see that every word\nof my bidding is done. We fail utterly unless all is secret and swift.\nIt is the lion attacking the village. If he crosses the trap gate safely\nhe may ravage at his pleasure, but there is first the trap to cross. And\nnow it is your time to leave.\"\n\nThe mountaineer tightened his girdle, and exchanged his slippers for\ndeer-hide boots. He bowed gravely to the other and slipped out into the\ndarkness of the court. Marker drew forth some plans and writing\nmaterials from his great-coat pocket and spread them before him on the\ntable. It was a thing he had done a hundred times within the last week,\nand as he made his calculations again and traced his route anew, his\naction showed the tinge of nervousness to which the strongest natures at\ntimes must yield. Then he wrote a letter, and, yawning deeply, he shut\nup the place and returned to Galetti's.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nMRS. LOGAN'S BALL\n\n\nWhen Lewis had finished breakfast next morning, and was sitting idly on\nthe verandah watching the busy life of the bazaar at his feet, a letter\nwas brought him by a hotel servant. \"It was left for you by Marker\nSahib, when he went away this morning. He sent his compliments to the\nsahibs and regretted that he had to leave too early to speak with them,\nbut he left this note.\" Lewis broke the envelope and read:\n\n\/#\n     DEAR MR. HAYSTOUN,\n\n     When I was thinking over our conversation last night, chance put a\n     piece of information in my way which you may think fit to use. You\n     know that I am more intimate than most people with the hill tribes.\n     Well, let this be the guarantee of my news, but do not ask how I\n     got it, for I cannot betray friends. Some of these, the Bada-Mawidi\n     to wit, are meditating mischief. The Forza camp, which I think you\n     have visited--a place some twenty miles off--is too near those\n     villages to be safe. So to-morrow at latest they have planned to\n     make a general attack upon it, and, unless the garrison were\n     prepared, I should fear for the result, for they are the most\n     cunning scoundrels in the world. What puzzles me is how they have\n     ever screwed up the courage for such a move, for lately they were\n     very much in fear of the Government. It appears as if they looked\n     for backing from over the frontier. You will say that this proves\n     your theory; but to me it merely seems as if some maniac of the\n     Gromchevtsky type had got among them. In any case I wish something\n     could be done. My duties take me away at once, and in a very\n     different direction, but perhaps you could find some means of\n     putting the camp on their guard. I should be sorry to hear of a\n     tragedy; also I should be sorry to see the Bada-Mawidi get into\n     trouble. They are foolish blackguards, but amusing.\n\n     Yours most sincerely,\n\n     ARTHUR MARKER.\n#\/\n\nLewis read the strange letter several times through, then passed it to\nGeorge. George read it with difficulty, not being accustomed to a\nflowing frontier hand. \"Jolly decent of him, I call it,\" was his\nremark.\n\n\"I would give a lot to know what to make of it. The man is playing some\ngame, but what the deuce it is I can't fathom.\"\n\n\"I suppose we had better get up to that Forza place as soon as we can.\"\n\n\"I think not,\" said Lewis.\n\n\"The man's honest, surely?\"\n\n\"But he is also clever. Remember who he is. He may wish to get us out\nof the way. I don't suppose that he can possibly fear us, but he may\nwant the coast clear from suspicious spectators. Besides, I don't see\nthe good of Forza. It is not the part of the hills I want to explore.\nThere can be no frontier danger there, and at the worst there can be\nnothing more than a little tribal disturbance. Now what on earth would\nRussia gain by moving the tribes there, except as a blind?\"\n\n\"Still, you know, the man admits all that in his letter. And if the\npeople up there are going to be in trouble we ought to go and give them\nnotice.\"\n\n\"I'll take an hour to think over it, and then I'll go and see Thwaite.\nHe was to be back this morning.\"\n\nLewis spread the letter before him. It was a simple, friendly note,\ngiving him a chance of doing a good turn to friends. His clear course\nwas to lay it before Thwaite and shift the responsibility for action to\nhis shoulders. But he felt all the while that this letter had a\npersonal application which he could not conceal. It would have been as\neasy for Marker to send the note to Thwaite, whom he had long known.\nBut he had chosen to warn him privately. It might be a ruse, but he had\nno glimpse of the meaning. Or, again, it might be a piece of pure\nfriendliness, a chance of unofficial adventure given by one wanderer to\nanother. He puzzled it out, lamenting that he was so deep in the dark,\nand cursing his indecision. Another man would have made up his mind\nlong ago; it was a ruse, therefore let it be neglected and remain in\nBardur with open eyes; it was good faith and a good chance, therefore\nlet him go at once. But to Lewis the possibilities seemed endless, and\nhe could find no solution save the old one of the waverer, to wait for\nfurther light.\n\nHe found Thwaite at breakfast, just returned from his travels.\n\n\"Hullo, Haystoun. I heard you were here. Awfully glad to see you. Sit\ndown, won't you, and have some breakfast.\" The officer was a long man,\nwith a thin, long face, a reddish moustache, and small, blue eyes.\n\n\"I came to ask you questions, if you don't mind. I have the regular\nglobe-trotter's trick of wanting information. What's the Forza camp\nlike? Do you think that the Bada-Mawidi, supposing they stir again,\nwould be likely to attack it?\"\n\n\"Not a bit of it. That was the sort of thing that Gribton was always\ncroaking about. Why, man, the Bada-Mawidi haven't a kick in them.\nBesides, they are very nearly twenty miles off and the garrison's a very\nfit lot. They're all right. Trust them to look after themselves.\"\n\n\"But I have been hearing stories of Bada-Mawidi risings which are to\ncome off soon.\"\n\n\"Oh, you'll always hear stories of that sort. All the old women in the\nneighbourhood purvey them.\"\n\n\"Who are in charge at Forza?\"\n\n\"Holm and Andover. Don't care much for Holm, but Andy is a good chap.\nBut what's this new interest of yours? Are you going up there?\n\n\"I'm out here to shoot and explore, you know, so Forza comes into my\nbeat. Thanks very much. See you to-night, I suppose.\"\n\nLewis went away dispirited and out of temper. He had been pitchforked\namong easy-going people, when all the while mysterious things, dangerous\nthings, seemed to hang in the air. He had not the material for even the\nfirst stages of comprehension. No one suspected, every one was\nsatisfied; and at the same time came those broken hints of other things.\nHe felt choked and muffled, wrapped in the cotton-wool of this easy\nlife; and all the afternoon he chafed at his own impotence and the\nworld's stupidity.\n\nWhen the two travellers presented themselves at the Logans' house that\nevening, they were immediately seized upon by the hostess and compelled,\nto their amusement, to do her bidding. They were her discoveries, her\nnew young men, and as such, they had their responsibilities. George,\nwho liked dancing, obeyed meekly; but Lewis, being out of temper and\nseeing before him an endless succession of wearisome partners, soon\nbroke loose, and accompanied Thwaite to the verandah for a cigar.\n\nThe man was ill at ease, and the sight of young faces and the sound of\nlaughter vexed him with a sense of his eccentricity. He could never,\nlike George, take the world as he found it. At home he was the slave of\nhis own incapacity; now he was the slave of memories. He had come out\non an errand, with a chance to recover his lost self-respect, and lo!\nhe was as far as ever from attainment. His lost capacity for action was\nnot to be found here, in the midst of this petty diplomacy and\ninglorious ease.\n\nFrom the verandah a broad belt of lawn ran down to the edge of the north\nroad. It lay shining in the moonlight like a field of snow with the\nhighway a dark ribbon beyond it. Thwaite and Lewis walked down to the\ngate talking casually, and at the gate they stopped and looked down on\nthe town. It lay a little to the left, the fort rising black before it,\nand the road ending in a patch of shade which was the old town gate.\nThe night was very still, cool airs blew noiselessly from the hills, and\na jackal barked hoarsely in some far-off thicket.\n\nThe men hung listlessly on the gate, drinking in the cool air and\nwatching the blue cigar smoke wreathe and fade. Suddenly down the road\nthere came the sound of wheels.\n\n\"That's a tonga,\" said Thwaite. \"Wonder who it is.\"\n\n\"Do tongas travel this road?\" Lewis asked.\n\n\"Oh yes, they go ten miles up to the foot of the rocks. We use them for\nsending up odds and ends to the garrisons. After that coolies are the\nonly conveyance. Gad, I believe this thing is going to stop.\"\n\nThe thing in question, which was driven by a sepoy in bright yellow\npyjamas, stopped at the Logans' gate. A peevish voice was heard giving\ndirections from within.\n\n\"It sounds like Holm,\" said Thwaite, walking up to it, \"and upon my soul\nit is Holm. What on earth are you doing here, my dear fellow?\"\n\n\"Is that you, Thwaite?\" said the voice. \"I wish you'd help me out. I\nwant Logan to give me a bed for the night. I'm infernally ill.\"\n\nLewis looked within and saw a pale face and bloodshot eyes which did not\nbelie the words.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Thwaite. \"Fever or anything smashed?\"\n\n\"I've got a bullet in my leg which has got to be cut out. Got it two\ndays ago when I was out shooting. Some natives up in the rocks did it,\nI fancy. Lord, how it hurts.\" And the unhappy man groaned as he tried\nto move.\n\n\"That's bad,\" said Thwaite sympathetically. \"The Logans have got a\ndance on, but we'll look after you all right. How did you leave things\nin Forza?\"\n\n\"Bad. I oughtn't to be here, but Andy insisted. He said I would only\nget worse and crock entirely. Things look a bit wild up there just now.\nThere has been a confounded lot of rifle-stealing, and the Bada-Mawidi\nare troublesome. However, I hope it's only their fun.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Thwaite. \"You know Haystoun, don't you?\"\n\n\"Glad to meet you,\" said the man. \"Heard of you. Coming up our way? I\nhope you will after I get this beastly leg of mine better.\"\n\n\"Thwaite will tell you I have been cross-examining him about your place.\nI wanted badly to ask you about it, for I got a letter this morning from\na man called Marker with some news for you.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\" asked Holm sharply.\n\n\"He said that he had heard privately that the Bada-Mawidi were planning\nan attack on you to-morrow or the day after.\"\n\n\"The deuce they are,\" said Holm peevishly, and Thwaite's face\nlengthened.\n\n\"And he told me to find some way of letting you know.\"\n\n\"Then why didn't you tell me earlier?\" said Thwaite. \"Marker should\nknow if anybody does. We should have kept Holm up there. Now it's\nalmost too late. Oh, this is the devil!\"\n\nLewis held his peace. He had forgotten the solidity of Marker's\nreputation.\n\n\"What's the chances of the place?\" Thwaite was asking. \"I know your\nnumbers and all that, but are they anything like prepared?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Holm miserably. \"They might get on all right, but\neverybody is pretty slack just now. Andy has a touch of fever, and some\nof the men may get leave for shooting. I must get back at once.\"\n\n\"You can't. Why, man, you couldn't get half way. And what's more, I\ncan't go. This place wants all the looking after it can get. A row in\nthe hills means a very good possibility of a row in Bardur, and that is\ntoo dangerous a game. And besides myself there is scarcely a man in the\nplace who counts. Logan has gone to Gilgit, and there's nobody left but\nboys.\"\n\n\"If you don't mind I should like to go,\" said Lewis shamefacedly.\n\n\"You,\" they cried. \"Do you know the road?\"\n\n\"I've been there before, and I remember it more or less. Besides, it is\nreally my show this time. I got the warning, and I want the credit.\"\nAnd he smiled.\n\n\"The road's bound to be risky,\" said Thwaite thoughtfully. \"I don't\nfeel inclined to let you run your neck into danger like this.\"\n\nLewis was busy turning over the problem in his mind. The presence of\nthe man Holm seemed the one link of proof he needed. He had his word\nthat there were signs of trouble in the place, and that the Bada-Mawidi\nwere ill at ease. Whatever game Marker was playing, on this matter he\nseemed to have spoken in good faith. Here was a clear piece of work for\nhim. And even if it was fruitless it would bring him nearer to the\nfrontier; his expedition to the north would be begun.\n\n\"Let me go,\" he said. \"I came out here to explore the hills and I take\nall risks on my own head. I can give them Marker's message as well as\nanybody else.\"\n\nThwaite looked at Holm. \"I don't see why he shouldn't. You're a wreck,\nand I can't leave my own place.\"\n\n\"Tell Andy you saw me,\" cried Holm. \"He'll be anxious. And tell him to\nmind the north gate. If the fools knew how to use dynamite they might\nhave it down at once. If they attack it can't last long, but then they\ncan't last long either, for they are hard up for arms, and unless they\nhave changed since last week they have no ammunition to speak of.\"\n\n\"Marker said it looked as if they were being put up to the job from over\nthe frontier.\"\n\n\"Gad, then it's my turn to look out,\" said Thwaite. \"If it's the\ngentlemen from over the frontier they won't stop at Forza. Lord, I hate\nthis border business, it's so hideously in the dark. But I think that's\nall rot. Any tribal row here is sure to be set down to Russian\ninfluence. We don't understand the joint possession of an artificial\nfrontier,\" he added, with an air of quoting from some book.\n\n\"Did you get that from Marker?\" Holm asked crossly. \"He once said the\nsame thing to me.\" His temper had suffered badly among the hills.\n\n\"We'd better get you to bed, my dear fellow,\" said Thwaite, looking down\nat him. \"You look remarkably cheap. Would you mind going in and trying\nto find Mrs. Logan, Haystoun? I'll carry this chap in. Stop a minute,\nthough. Perhaps he's got something to say to you.\"\n\n\"Mind the north gate ... tell Andy I'm all right and make him look\nafter himself ... he's overworking ... if you want to send a\nmessage to the other people you'd better send by Nazri ... if the\nBadas mean business they'll shut up the road you go by. That's all.\nGood luck and thanks very much.\"\n\nLewis found Mrs. Logan making a final inspection of the supper-room.\nShe ran to the garden, to find the invalid Holm in Thwaite's arms at the\nsteps of the verandah. The sick warrior pulled off an imaginary cap and\nsmiled feebly.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Holm, I'm so sorry. Of course we can have you. I'll put you in\nthe other end of the house where you won't be so much troubled with the\nnoise. You must have had a dreadful journey.\" And so forth, with the\neasy condolences of a kind woman.\n\nWhen Thwaite had laid down his burden, he turned to Lewis.\n\n\"I wish we had another man, Haystoun. What about your friend Winterham?\nOne's enough to do your work, but if the thing turns out to be serious,\nthere ought to be some means of sending word. Andover will want you to\nstay, for they are short-handed enough.\"\n\n\"I'll get Winterham to go and wait for me somewhere. If I don't turn up\nby a certain time, he can come and look for me.\"\n\n\"That will do,\" said Thwaite, \"though it's a stale job for him. Well,\ngood-bye and good luck to you. I expect there won't be much trouble,\nbut I wish you had told us in the morning.\"\n\nLewis turned to go and find George. \"What a chance I had almost\nmissed,\" was the word in his heart. The errand might be futile, the\nmessage a blind, but it was at least movement, action, a possibility.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nFRIEND TO FRIEND\n\n\nHe found George sitting down in the verandah after waltzing. His\npartner was a sister of Logan's, a dark girl whose husband was Resident\nsomewhere in Lower Kashmir. The lady gave her hand to Lewis and he took\nthe vacant seat on the other side.\n\nHe apologized for carrying off her companion, escorted her back to the\nballroom, and then returned to satisfy the amazed George.\n\n\"I want to talk to you. Excuse my rudeness, but I have explained to\nMrs. Tracy. I have a good many things I want to say to you.\"\n\n\"Where on earth have you been all night, Lewis? I call it confoundedly\nmean to go off and leave me to do all the heavy work. I've never been\nso busy in my life. Lots of girls and far too few men. This is the\nfirst breathing space I've had. What is it that you want?\"\n\n\"I am going off this very moment up into the hills. That letter Marker\nsent me this morning has been confirmed. Holm, who commands up at the\nForza fort, has just come down very sick, and he says that the\nBada-Mawidi are looking ugly, and that we should take Marker's word. He\nwanted to go back himself but he is too ill, and Thwaite can't leave\nhere, so I am going. I don't expect there will be much risk, but in\ncase the rising should be serious I want you to do me a favour.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can't come with you,\" said George ruefully. \"I know I\npromised to let you go your own way before we came out, but I wish you\nwould let me stick by you. What do you want me to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing desperate,\" said Lewis, laughing. \"You can stay on here and\ndance till sunrise if you like. But to-morrow I want you to come up to\na certain place at the foot of the hills which I will tell you about,\nand wait there. It's about half distance between Forza and the two\nKhautmi forts. If the rising turns out to be a simple affair I'll join\nyou there to-morrow night and we can start our shooting. But if I\ndon't, I want you to go up to the Khautmi forts and rouse St. John and\nMitchinson and get them to send to Forza. Do you see?\"\n\nLewis had taken out a pencil and began to sketch a rough plan on\nGeorge's shirt cuff. \"This will give you an idea of the place. You can\nlook up a bigger map in the hotel, and Thwaite or any one will give you\ndirections about the road. There's Forza, and there are the Khautmis\nabout twenty miles west. Half-way between the two is that long Nazri\nvalley, and at the top is a tableland strewn with boulders where you\nshoot mountain sheep. I've been there, and the road between Khautmi and\nForza passes over it. I expect it is a very bad road, but apparently\nyou can get a little Kashmir pony to travel it. To the north of that\nplateau there is said to be nothing but rock and snow for twenty miles\nto the frontier. That may be so, but if this thing turns out all right\nwe'll look into the matter. Anyway, you have got to pitch your tent\nto-morrow on that tableland just above the head of the Nazri gully.\nWith luck I should be able to get to you some time in the afternoon. If\nI don't turn up, you go off to Khautmi next morning at daybreak and give\nthem my message. If I can't come myself I'll find a way to send word;\nbut if you don't hear from me it will be fairly serious, for it will\nmean that the rising is a formidable thing after all. And that, of\ncourse, will mean trouble for everybody all round. In that case you'd\nbetter do what St. John and Mitchinson tell you. You're sure to be\nwanted.\"\n\nGeorge's face cleared. \"That sounds rather sport. I'd better bring up\nthe servants. They might turn out useful. And I suppose I'll bring a\ncouple of rifles for you, in case it's all a fraud and we want to go\nshooting. I thought the place was going to be stale, but it promises\npretty well now.\" And he studied the plan on his shirt cuff. Then an\nidea came to him.\n\n\"Suppose you find no rising. That will mean that Marker's letter was a\nblind of some sort. He wanted to get you out of the way or something.\nWhat will you do then? Come back here?\"\n\n\"N--o,\" said Lewis hesitatingly. \"I think Thwaite is good enough, and I\nshould be no manner of use. You and I will wait up there in the hills\non the off-chance of picking up some news. I swear I won't come back\nhere to hang about and try and discover things. It's enough to drive a\nman crazy.\"\n\n\"It is rather a ghastly place. Wonder how the Logans thrive here. Odd\nmixture this. Strauss and hill tribes not twenty miles apart.\"\n\nLewis laughed. \"I think I prefer the hill tribes. I am not in the\nhumour for Strauss just now. I shall have to be off in an hour, so I am\ngoing to change. See you to-morrow, old man.\"\n\nGeorge retired to the ballroom, where he had to endure the reproaches of\nMrs. Logan. He was an abstracted and silent partner, and in the\nintervals of dancing he studied his cuff. Miss A talked to him of polo,\nand Miss B of home; Miss C discovered that they had common friends, and\nMiss D that she had known his sister. Miss E, who was more observant,\nsaw the cause of his distraction and asked, \"What queer hieroglyphics\nhave you got on your cuff, Mr. Winterham?\"\n\nGeorge looked down in a bewildered way at his sleeve. \"Where on earth\nhave I been?\" he asked in wonder. \"That's the worst of being an\nabsent-minded fellow. I've been scribbling on my cuff with my programme\npencil.\"\n\nSoon he escaped, and made his way down to the garden gate, where Thwaite\nwas standing smoking. A _sais_ held a saddled pony by the road-side.\nLewis, in rough shooting clothes, was preparing to mount. From indoors\ncame the jigging of a waltz tune and the sound of laughter, while far in\nthe north the cliffs of the pass framed a dark blue cleft where the\nstars shone. George drew in great draughts of the cool, fresh air. \"I\nwish I was coming with you,\" he said wistfully.\n\n\"You'll be in time enough to-morrow,\" said Lewis. \"I wish you'd give\nhim all the information you can about the place, Thwaite. He's an\nignorant beggar. See that he remembers to bring food and matches. The\nguns are the only things I can promise he won't forget.\"\n\nThen he rode off, the little beast bucking excitedly at the patches of\nmoonlight, and the two men walked back to the house.\n\n\"Hope he comes back all right,\" said Thwaite. \"He's too good a man to\nthrow away.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE ROAD TO FORZA\n\n\nThe road ran in a straight line through the valley of dry rocks, a dull,\nmodern road, engineered and macadamized up to the edge of the hills.\nThe click of hoofs raised echoes in the silence, for in all the great\nvalley, in the chain of pools in the channel, the acres of sun-dried\nstone, the granite rocks, the tangle of mountain scrub, there seemed no\nlife of bird or beast. It was a strange, deathly stillness, and\noverhead the purple sky, sown with a million globes of light, seemed so\nnear and imminent that the glen for the moment was but a vast jewel-lit\ncavern, and the sky a fretted roof which spanned the mountains.\n\nFor the first time Lewis felt the East. Hitherto he had been unable to\nsee anything in his errand but its futility. A stupider man, with a\nsharp, practical brain, would have taken himself seriously and come to\nBardur with an intent and satisfied mind. He would have assumed the air\nof a diplomatist, have felt the dignity of his mission, and in success\nand failure have borne himself with self-confidence. But to Lewis the\nbusiness which loomed serious in England, at Bardur took on the colour\nof comedy. He felt his impotence, he was touched insensibly by the easy\ncontent of the place. Frontier difficulties seemed matters for romance\nand comic opera; and Bardur resolved itself into an English suburb, all\ntea-parties and tennis. But at times an austere conscience jogged him\nto remembrance, and in one such fitful craving for action and enterprise\nhe had found this errand. Now at last, astride the little Kashmir pony,\nwith his face to the polestar and the hills, he felt the mystery of a\nstrange world, and his work assumed a tinge of the adventurer. This was\nnew, he told himself; this was romance. He had his eyes turned to a new\nland, and the smell of dry mountain sand and scrub, and the vault-like,\nimperial sky were the earnest of his inheritance. This was the East,\nthe gorgeous, the impenetrable. Before him were the hill deserts, and\nthen the great, warm plains, and the wide rivers, and then on and on to\nthe cold north, the steppes, the icy streams, the untrodden forests. To\nthe west and beyond the mountains were holy mosques, \"shady cities of\npalm trees,\" great walled towns to which north and west and south\nbrought their merchandise. And to the east were latitudes more\nwonderful, the uplands of the world, the impassable borders of the\noldest of human cultures. Names rang in his head like tunes--Khiva,\nBokhara, Samarkand, the goal of many boyish dreams born of clandestine\nsuppers and the Arabian Nights. It was an old fierce world he was on\nthe brink of, and the nervous frontier civilization fell a thousand\nmiles behind him.\n\nThe white road turned to the right with the valley, and the hills crept\ndown to the distance of a gun-shot. The mounting tiers of stone and\nbrawling water caught the moonlight in waves, and now he was in a cold\npit of shadow and now in a patch of radiant moonshine. It was a world\nof fantasy, a rousing world of wintry hill winds and sudden gleams of\nsummer. His spirits rose high, and he forgot all else in plain\nenjoyment. Now at last he had found life, rich, wild, girt with\nmarvels. He was beginning to whistle some air when his pony shied\nviolently and fell back, and at the same moment a pistol-shot cracked\nout of a patch of thorn.\n\nHe turned the beast and rode straight at the thicket, which was a very\nlittle one. The ball had wandered somewhere into the void, and no harm\nwas done, but he was curious about its owner. Up on the hillside he\nseemed to see a dark figure scrambling among the cliffs in the fretted\nmoonlight.\n\nIt is unpleasant to be shot at in the dark from the wayside, but at the\nmoment the thing pleased this strange young man. It seemed a token that\nat last he was getting to work. He found a rope stretched taut across\nthe road, which accounted for the pony's stumble. Laughing heartily, he\ncut it with his knife, and continued, cheerful as before, but somewhat\nless fantastic. Now he kept a sharp eye on all wayside patches.\n\nAt the head of the valley the waters of the stream forked into two\ntorrents, one flowing from the east in an open glen up which ran the\nroad to Yarkand, the other descending from the northern hills in a wild\ngully. At the foot stood a little hut with an apology for stabling,\nwhere an old and dirty gentleman of the Hunza race pursued his calling\ntill such time as he should attract the notice of his friends up in the\nhills and go to paradise with a slit throat.\n\nLewis roused the man with a violent knocking at the door. The old\nruffian appeared with a sputtering lamp which might have belonged to a\ncave man, and a head of matted grey hair which suggested the same\norigin. He was old and suspicious, but at Lewis's bidding he hobbled\nforth and pointed out the stabling.\n\n\"The pony is to stay here till it is called for. Do you hear? And if\nHolm Sahib returns and finds that it is not fed he will pay you nothing.\nSo good night, father. Sound sleep and a good conscience.\"\n\nHe turned to the twisting hill road which ran up from the light into the\ngloom of the cleft with all the vigour of an old mountaineer who has\nbeen long forced to dwell among lowlands. Once a man acquires the art\nof hill walking he will always find flat country something of a burden,\nand the mere ascent of a slope will have a tonic's power. The path was\ngood, but perilous at the best, and the proximity of yawning precipices\ngave a zest to the travel. The road would fringe a pit of shade, black\nbut for the gleam of mica and the scattered foam of the stream. It was\nno longer a silent world. Hawks screamed at times from the cliffs, and\na multitude of bats and owls flickered in the depths. A continuous\nfalling of waters, an infinite sighing of night winds, the swaying and\ntossing which is always heard in the midmost mountain solitudes, the\ncrumbling of hill gravel and the bleat of a goat on some hill-side, all\nmade a cheerful accompaniment to the scraping of his boots on the rocky\nroad.\n\nHe remembered the way as if he had travelled it yesterday. Soon the\ngorge would narrow and he would be almost at the water's edge. Then the\npath turned to the right and wound into the heart of a side nullah,\nwhich at length brought it out on a little plateau of rocks. There the\nroad climbed a long ridge till at last it reached the great plateau,\nwhere Forza, set on a small hilltop, watched thirty miles of primeval\ndesert. The air was growing chilly, for the road climbed steeply and\nalready it was many thousand feet above the sea. The curious salt smell\nwhich comes from snow and rock was beginning to greet his nostrils. The\nblood flowed more freely in his veins, and insensibly he squared his\nshoulders to drink in the cold hill air. It was of the mountains and\nyet strangely foreign, an air with something woody and alpine in the\nheart of it, an air born of scrub and snow-clad rock, and not of his own\nfree spaces of heather. But it was hill-born, and this contented him;\nit was night-born, and it refreshed him. In a little the road turned\ndown to the stream side, and he was on the edge of a long dark pool.\n\nThe river, which made a poor show in the broad channel at Bardur, was\nnow, in this straitened place, a full lipping torrent of clear, green\nwater. Lewis bathed his flushed face and drank, and it was as cold as\nsnow. It stung his face to burning, and as he walked the heartsome glow\nof great physical content began to rise in his heart. He felt fit and\nready for any work. Life was quick in his sinews, his brain was a\nweathercock, his strength was tireless. At last he had found a man's\nlife. He had never had a chance before. Life had been too easy and\nsheltered; he had been coddled like a child; he had never roughed it\nexcept for his own pleasure. Now he was outside this backbone of the\nworld with a task before him, and only his wits for his servant. Eton\nand Oxford, Eton and Oxford--so it had been for generations--an\neducation sufficient to damn a race. Stocks was right, and he had all\nalong been wrong; but now he was in a fair way to taste the world's iron\nand salt, and he exulted at the prospect.\n\nIt was hard walking in the nullah. In and out of great crevices the\nroad wound itself, on the brink of stupendous waterfalls, or in the\nheart of a brushwood tangle. Soon a clear vault of sky replaced the\nout-jutting crags, and he came out on a little plateau where a very cold\nwind was blowing. The smell of snow was in the air, a raw smell like\nsalt when carried on a north wind over miles of granite crags. But on\nthe little tableland the moon was shining clearly. It was green with\nsmall cloud-berries and dwarf juniper, and the rooty fragrance was for\nall the world like an English bolt or a Highland pasture. Lewis flung\nhimself prone and buried his face among the small green leaves. Then,\nstill on the ground, he scanned the endless yellow distance. Mountains,\nserrated and cleft as in some giant's play, rose on every hand, while\nthrough the hollows gleamed the farther snow-peaks. This little bare\nplateau must be naked to any eye on any hill-side, and at the thought he\ngot to his feet and advanced.\n\nAt first sight the place had looked not a mile long, but before he got\nto the farther slope he found that it was nearer two. The mountain air\nhad given him extraordinary lightness, and he ran the distance, finding\nthe hard, sandy soil like a track under his feet. The slope, when he\nhad reached it, proved to be abrupt and boulder-strewn, and the path had\nan ugly trick of avoiding steepness by skirting horrible precipices.\nLuckily the moon was bright, and the man was an old mountaineer;\notherwise he might have found a grave in the crevices which seamed the\nhill.\n\nHe had not gone far when he began to realize that he was not the only\noccupant of the mountain side. A whistle which was not a bird's seemed\nto catch his ear at times, and once, as he shrank back into the lee of a\nboulder, there was the sound of naked feet on the road before him. This\nwas news indeed, and he crept very cautiously up the rugged path. Once,\nwhen in shelter, he looked out, and for a second, in a patch of\nmoonlight, he saw a man with the loose breeches and tightened girdle of\nthe hillmen. He was running swiftly as if to some arranged place of\nmeeting.\n\nThe sight put all doubts out of his head. An attack on Forza was\nimminent, and this was the side from which least danger would be\nexpected. If the enemy got there before him they would find an easy\nentrance. The thought made him quicken his pace. These scattered\ntribesmen must meet before they attacked, and there might still be time\nfor him to get in front. His ears were sharp as a deer's to the\nslightest sound. A great joy in the game possessed him. When he\ncrouched in the shelter of a granite boulder or sprawled among the scrub\nwhile the light footsteps of a tribesman passed on the road he felt that\none point was scored to him in a game in which he had no advantages. He\nblessed his senses trained by years of sport to a keenness beyond a\ntownsman's; his eye, which could see distances clear even in the misty\nmoonlight; his ear, which could judge the proximity of sounds with a\nnice exactness. Twice he was on the brink of discovery. A twig snapped\nas he lay in cover, and he heard footsteps pause, and he knew that a\npair of very keen eyes were scanning the brushwood. He blessed his\nlucky choice in clothes which had made him bring a suit so near the hue\nof his hiding-place. Then he felt that the eyes were averted, the\nfootsteps died away, and he was safe. Again, as he turned a corner\nswiftly, he almost came on the back of a man who was stepping along\nleisurely before him. For a second he stopped, and then he was back\nround the corner, and had swung himself up to a patch of shadow on the\ncrag-side. He looked down and saw his enemy clearly in the moonlight; a\nlong, ferret-faced fellow, with a rifle hung on his back and an ugly\ncrooked knife in his hand. The man looked round, sniffing the air like\na stag, and then, satisfied that there was nothing to fear, turned and\nwent on. Lewis, who had been sitting on a sharp jag of rock, swung an\naching body to the ground and advanced circumspectly.\n\nIn an hour or two he came to the top of the slope and the beginning of\nthe second tableland. A grey dimness was taking the place of the dark,\nand it had suddenly grown bitterly cold. Dawn in such high latitudes is\nnot a thing of violent changes, but of slow and subtle gradations of\nlight, of sudden, coy flushes of colour, of thin winds and bright\nfleeting hazes. He lay for a minute in the scrub of cloud-berries, the\ncollar of his coat buttoned round his throat, and the morning wind,\nfresh from leagues of snow, blowing chill on his face. Behind was the\nslope alive with men who at any moment might emerge on the plateau. He\nwaited for the sight of a figure, but none came; clearly the muster was\nnot yet complete. A thought grew in his brain, and a sudden clearness\nin the air translated it into action; for in the hazy distance across\nthe tableland he saw the walls of Forza fort.\n\nThe place could not be two miles off, and between it and him there was\nthe smooth benty plateau. He might make a rush for it and cross\nunobserved. Even now the early sun was beginning to strike it. The\nyellow-grey walls stood out clear against the far line of mountains, and\nthe wisp of colour which fluttered in the wind was clearly the British\nflag. The exceeding glory of the morning gave him a new vigour. Why\nshould not he run with any tribesman of the lot? If he could but avoid\nthe risk of a rifle bullet at the outset, he would have no fear of the\nissue.\n\nHe glanced behind him. The place seemed still, though far down there\nwas a tinkle as of little stones falling. He stood up, straightened\nhimself for one moment till he had filled his lungs with the clean air.\nThen he started to run quickly towards the fort.\n\nThe full orb of the sun topped the mountains and the dazzle was in his\neyes from the first. If he covered the first half-mile unpursued he\nwould be safe; otherwise he might expect a bullet. It was a comic\nfeeling--the wide green heath, the fresh air, the easy vigour in his\nstride, the flush of the morning sun, and that awkward, nervous weakness\nin the small of his back where a bullet might be expected to find a\nlodgment.\n\nHe never looked back till he had gone what seemed to him the proper\ndistance, and then he glanced hurriedly over his shoulder.\n\nTwo men had emerged from the scrub and stood on the edge of the slope.\nThey were gazing intently at him, and suddenly one lifted a Snider to\nhis shoulder and fired. The bullet burrowed in the sand to the right of\nhim. Again he looked back and there they were--five of them now--crying\nout to him. Then with one accord they followed over the plateau.\n\nIt was now a clear race for life. He must keep beyond reasonable\nrifle-shot; otherwise a broken leg might bring him to a standstill. He\ncursed the deceptive clearness of the hill air which made it impossible\nfor his unpractised eye to judge distances. The fort stood clear in\nevery stone, but it might be miles off though it looked scarcely a\nthousand yards. Apparently it was still asleep, for no smoke was\nrising, and, strain his ears as he might, he could hear no sound of a\nsentry's walk. This looked awkward indeed for him. If the people were\nnot awake to receive him, he would be potted against its wall as surely\nas a rat in a corner. He grew acutely nervous, and as he drew nearer he\nmade the air hideous with shouts to wake the garrison. A clear race in\nthe open he did not mind; but he had no stomach for a game of\nhide-and-seek around an unscalable wall with an active enemy.\n\nApparently the gentry behind him were growing despondent. Two rifle\nbullets, fired by running men, sang unsteadily in his wake. He was now\nso near that he could see the rough wooden gate and the pyramidal nails\nwith which it was studded. He could guess the number of paces between\nhim and safety. He was out of breath and a little tired, for the\nscramble up the nullah had not been a light one. Again he yelled\nfrantically to the dead walls, beseeching their inmates to get out of\nbed and save his life.\n\nThere was still no sound from the sleeping fortress. He was barely a\nhundred yards off, and he saw now that the walls were too high to climb\nand that nothing remained but the gate. He picked up a stone and flung\nit against the woodwork. The din echoed through the empty place, but\nthere was no sound of life. Just at the threshold there was a patch of\nshadow. It was his one way of escape, and as he reached the door and\nkicked and hammered at the wood, he cowered down in the shade, praying\nthat his friends behind might be something less than sharpshooters.\n\nThe pursuit saw its chance, and running forward to get within easy\nrange, proceeded to target practice. Lewis, kicking diligently at the\ndoor, was trying to draw himself into the smallest space, and his mind\nwas far from comfortable. It needs good nerves to fill the position of\na target with equanimity, and he was too tired to take it in good part.\nA disagreeable cold sweat stood on his brow, and his heart beat\nviolently. Then a bullet did what all his knocking had failed to do,\nfor it crashed into the woodwork and woke the garrison. He heard feet\nhurrying across a yard, and then it seemed to him that men were\nreconnoitring from the top of the wall. A second later--when the third\nbullet had buried itself in dust a foot beyond his head--the heavy gate\nwas half opened and a man's hand assisted him to crawl inside.\n\nHe looked up to see a tall figure in pyjamas standing over him. \"Now I\nwonder who the deuce you are?\" it was saying.\n\n\"My name's Haystoun. H-a-y-s;\" then he broke off and laughed. He had\nfallen into his old trick of spelling his name to the Oxford tradesmen\nwhen he was young and hated to have it garbled.\n\nHe looked up at the questioner again. \"Bless me, Andy, so it's you.\"\n\nThe man gave a yell of delight. \"Lewis, upon my soul. Who'd have\nthought it? It is a Providence. By Gad, I believe I'm just in time to\nsave your life.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nTHE HILL-FORT\n\n\nLewis got to his feet and blinked at the morning sun across the yard.\n\n\"That was a near shave. Phew, I hate being a target for sharpshooting!\nThese devils are your friends the Bada-Mawidi.\"\n\n\"The deuce they are,\" said Andover lugubriously. \"I always knew it.\nI've told Holm a hundred times, and now here is the beggar away sick and\nI am left to pay the piper.\"\n\n\"I know. I met him in Bardur, and that's why I'm here. He told me to\ntell you to mind the north gate.\"\n\n\"More easily said than done. We're too few by half here if things get\nnasty. How was the chap looking?\"\n\n\"Pretty miserable. Thwaite and I put him to bed. Then they sent me off\nhere, for I've got news for you. You know a man called Marker?\"\n\nAndover nodded.\n\n\"I was dining with him the day before yesterday, and yesterday morning I\ngot a note from him. He says that he has heard from some private source\nthat the Bada-Mawidi were arming and proposed an attack on Forza to-day.\nHe thinks they may have got their arms from the other side, you know.\nAt any rate he asked me to try to let you hear, and when I saw Holm last\nnight and heard that such a thing was possible, I came off at once. I\nsuppose Marker is the sort of man who should know.\"\n\n\"What did Thwaite say?\"\n\n\"He was keen that I should come at once. Do you think that it's a false\nalarm?\"\n\n\"Oh, it will be genuine enough on Marker's part, but he may have been\nmisinformed. What beats me is the attack by day. I know the Badas as I\nknow my own name, and they're too few at the best to have any chance of\nrushing the place. Besides, they are poor fighters in the open. On the\nother hand they are devils incarnate in a night attack, as we used to\nfind to our cost. You are sure he said to-day?\"\n\n\"Sure. Some time this morning.\"\n\n\"Wonder what their game is. However, he ought to be right if anybody\nis, and we are much obliged to you for your trouble. You had a pretty\nhard time in the open, but how on earth did you get up the hill?\"\n\n\"Deerstalking style. It was good sport. But for heaven's sake, Andy,\ngive me breakfast, and tell me what you want me to do. I am under your\norders now.\"\n\n\"You'd better feed and then sleep for a bit. If you don't mind I'll\nleave you, for I've got to be very busy. And poor old Holm looked\npretty sick, did he? Well, I am glad he has been saved this affair\nanyhow.\"\n\nA Sikh orderly brought Lewis breakfast. Beyond the tent door there was\nstir in the garrison. Men were deployed in the yard, Gurkhas mainly,\nwith a few Kashmir sepoys, and the loud harsh voice of Andover was\nraised to give orders. It was a hot still morning, with something\nthunderous in the air. Hot sulphurous clouds were massing on the\nwestern horizon, and the cool early breeze had gone. The whole place\nsmelt of powder.\n\nHalf-way through the meal Andover returned, his lean face red with\nexertion. \"I've got things more or less in order. They may easily\nstarve us out, for we are wretchedly provisioned, but I don't think\nthey'll get us with a rush. I wonder when the show is to commence.\" He\ndrank some coffee, and then filled a pipe.\n\n\"I left a man at Nazri. If the thing turns out to be a small affair I\nam to meet him there to-night; but if I don't come he is to know that it\nis serious and go and warn the Khautmi people. You haven't a connection\nby any chance?\"\n\n\"No. Wish we had. The heliograph is no good, and the telegraph is\nstill under the consideration of some engineer man. But how do you\npropose to get to Nazri? It's only twelve miles, but they are mostly up\non end.\"\n\n\"I did it when I was here before. It's easy enough if you have done any\nrock-climbing, and I can leave with the light. Besides, there's a\nmoon.\"\n\nAndover laughed. \"You've turned over a new leaf, Lewis. Your energy\nputs us all to shame. I wish I had your physical gifts, my son. The\nworst of being long and lanky in a place like this is that you're always\nas stiff as a poker. I shall die of sciatica before I am forty. But\nupon my word it is queer meeting you here in the loneliest spot in\ncreation. When I saw you in town before I came out, you were going into\nParliament or some game of that kind. Then I heard that you had been\nout here, and gone back; and now for no earthly reason I waken up one\nfine morning to find you being potted at before my gate. You're as\nsudden as Marker, and a long chalk more mysterious.\"\n\nLewis looked grave. \"I wish Marker were only as simple as me, or I as\nsudden as him. It's a gift not learned in a day. Anyhow I'm here, and\nwe've got a day's sport before us. Hullo, the ball seems about to open.\"\nLittle puffs of smoke and dust were rising from beyond the wall, and on\nthe heavy air came the faint ping-ping of rifles.\n\nAndover stretched himself elaborately. \"Lord alive, but this is absurd.\nWhat do these beggars expect to do? They can't shell a fort with stolen\nexpresses.\"\n\nThe two men went up to the edge of the wall and looked over the plateau.\nA hundred yards off stood a group of tribesmen formed in some semblance\nof military order, each with a smoking rifle in his hand. It was like a\nparody of a formation, and Andover after rubbing his eyes burst into a\nroar of laughter.\n\n\"The beggars must be mad. What in heaven's name do they expect to do,\nstanding there like mummies and potting at a stone wall? There's two\nmore companies of them over there. It isn't war, it's comic opera.\" And\nhe sat down, still laughing, on the edge of a gun-case to put on the\nboots which his orderly had brought.\n\nIt was comic opera, but the tinge of melodrama was not absent. When a\nsufficient number of rounds had been fired, the tribesmen, as if acting\non half-understood instructions from some prehistoric manual, slung\ntheir rifles on their shoulders and came on. The fire from the fort did\nnot stop them, though it broke their line. In a minute they were\nclutching at every hand-grip and foothold on the wall, and Andover with\na beaming face directed the disposition of his men.\n\nForza is built of great, rough stones, with ends projecting in places\ncyclopean-wise, which to an active man might give a foothold. The\nlittle garrison was at its posts, and picked the men off with carbines\nand revolvers, and in emergencies gave a brown chest the straight\nbayonet-thrust home. The tribesmen fought like fiends, scrambling up\nsilently with long knives between their teeth, till a shot found them\nand they rolled back to die on the sand at the foot. Now and again\na man would reach the parapet and spring down into the courtyard. Then\nit was the turn of Andover and Lewis to account for him, and they did\nnot miss. One man with matted hair and beard was at Lewis's back before\nhe saw him. A crooked knife had nearly found that young man's neck, but\na lucky twisting aside saved him. He dodged his adversary up and down\nthe yard till he got his pistol from his inner pocket. Then it was his\nturn to face about. The man never stopped and a ball took him between\nthe eyes. He dropped dead as a stone, and his knife flying from his\nhand skidded along the sand till it stopped with a clatter on the\nstones. The sound in the hot sulphurous air grated horribly, and Lewis\nclapped his hands to his ears to find that he too had not come off\nscathless. The knife had cut the lobe, and, bleeding like a pig, he\nwent in search of water.\n\nThe assailants seemed prepared to find paradise speedily, for they were\nnot sparing with their lives. The attacking party was small, and\napparently there was no reserve, for in all the wide landscape there was\nno sign of man. Then for no earthly reason the assault was at an end.\nOne by one the men dropped back and disappeared from the plateau. There\nwas no overt signal, no sound; but in a little the annoyed garrison were\nlooking at vacancy and one another.\n\n\"This is the devil's own business,\" said Andover, rubbing his eyes. The\nmen, too astonished to pick off stragglers, allowed the enemy to melt\ninto space; then they set themselves down with rifles cuddled up to\ntheir chins, and stared at Andover.\n\n\"It beats me,\" said that disturbed man. \"How many killed?\"\n\n\"Seven,\" said a sergeant. \"About five more wounded. None of us\ntouched, barring a bullet in my boot, and two Johnnies slashed on the\ncheek. Seems to me as if the gen'lman, Mr. 'Aystoun, was 'it, though.\"\n\nAt the word Andover ran for his quarters, where he found his servant\ndressing Lewis's wounded ear. That young man with a face of great\ndespair was inclining his head over a basin.\n\n\"What's the matter, Andy? Don't tell me the show has stopped. I\nthought they were game to go on for hours, and I was just coming to join\nyou.\"\n\n\"They've gone, every mother's son of them. I told you it was comic\nopera all along. Seven of them have found the part too much for them,\nbut the rest have cleared out like smoke. I give it up.\"\n\nLewis stared at the speaker, his brain busy with a problem. For a\nmoment before the fight, and for a little during its progress he had\nbeen serenely happy. He had done something hard and perilous; he had\nrisked bullets; he had brought authentic news of a real danger. He was\nhappily at peace with himself; the bland quiet of conscience which he\nhad not felt for months had given him the vision of a new life. But the\ndanger had faded away in smoke; and here was Andover with a mystified\nface asking its meaning.\n\n\"I swear that those fellows never had the least intention of beating us.\nThere were far too few of them for one thing. They looked like\ncriminals fighting under sentence, you know, like the Persian fellows.\nIt was more like some religious ceremony than a fight. The whole thing\nis beyond me, but I think no harm's done. Hang it, I wish Holm were\nhere. He's a depressing beggar, but he takes responsibility off my\nshoulders.\"\n\nThe dead men were buried as quickly and decently as the place allowed\nof. Things were generally cleaned up, and by noon the little fort was\nas spick as if the sound of a rifle had never been heard within its\nwalls. Lewis and Andover had the midday meal in a sort of gun-room\nwhich looked over the edge of the plateau to a valley in the hills. It\nhad been arranged and furnished by a former commandant who found in the\nview a repetition of the one in a much-loved Highland shooting-box.\nAccordingly it was comfortable and homelike beyond the average of\nfrontier dwellings. Outside a dripping mist had clouded the hills and\nchilled the hot air.\n\nThe two men smoked silently, knocking out their ashes and refilling with\nthe regularity of clockwork. Lewis was thinking hard, thinking of the\nbitterness of dashed hopes, of self-confidence clutched at and lost. He\nsaw as if in an inspiration the trend of Marker's plans. He had been\ngiven a paltry fictitious errand, like a bone to a dog, to quiet him.\nSome devilry was afoot and he must be got out of the road. For a second\nthe thought pleased him, the thought that at least one man held him\nworthy of attention, and went out of his way to circumvent him. But the\ngleam of satisfaction was gone in a moment. He could not even be sure\nthat there was guile at the back of it. It might be all foolish\nhonesty, and to a man cursed with a sense of weakness the thought of\nsuch a pedestrian failure was trebly intolerable.\n\nBut honesty was inconceivable. He and he alone in all the frontier\ncountry knew Marker and his ways. To Andover, sucking his pipe dismally\nbeside him, the thing appeared clear as the daylight. Marker, the best\nman alive, had word of some Bada-Mawidi doings and had given a friendly\nhint. It was not his blame if the thing had fizzled out like damp\npowder. But to Lewis, Marker was a man of uncanny powers and\nintelligence beyond others, the iron will of the true adventurer. There\nmust be devilry behind it all, and to the eye of suspicion there was\ndoubt in every detail. And meantime he had fallen an easy victim.\nMarooned in this frontier fort, the world might be turned topsy-turvy at\nBardur, and he not a word the wiser. Things were slipping from his\ngrasp again. He had an intense desire to shut his eyes and let all\ndrift. He had done enough. He had come up here at the risk of his\nneck; fate had fought against him, and he must succumb. The fatal\nwisdom of proverbs was all on his side.\n\nBut once again conscience assailed him. Why had he believed Marker,\nknowing what he knew? He had been led by the nose like a crude\nschool-boy. It was nothing to him that he had to believe or remain idle\nin Bardur. Another proof of his folly! This importunate sense of\nweakness was the weakest of all qualities. It made him a nervous and\nawkward follower of strength, only to plunge deeper into the mud of\nincapacity.\n\nAndover looked at him curiously. His annoyance was of a different\nstamp--a little disappointment, intense boredom, and the ever-present\nfrontier anxiety. But such were homely complaints to be forgotten over\na pipe and in sleep. It struck him that his companion's eyes betrayed\nsomething more, and he kicked him on the shins into attention.\n\n\"Been seedy lately? Have some quinine. Or if you can't sleep I can\ntell you a dodge. But you know you are looking a bit cheap, old man.\"\n\n\"I'm pretty fit,\" said Lewis, and he raised his brown face to a glass.\n\"Why I'm tanned like a nigger and my eye's perfectly clear.\"\n\n\"Then you're in love,\" said the mysterious Andover. \"Trust me for\nknowing. When a man keeps as quiet as you for so long, he's either in\nlove or seedy. Up here people don't fall in love, so I thought it must\nbe the other thing.\"\n\n\"Rot,\" said Lewis. \"I'm going out of doors. I must be off pretty soon,\nif I'm to get to Nazri by sundown. I wish you'd come out and show me\nthe sort of lie of the land. There are three landmarks, but I can't\nremember their order.\"\n\nAn hour later the two men returned, and Lewis sat down to an early\ndinner. He ate quickly, and made up sandwiches which he stuffed into\nhis pocket. Then he rose and gripped his host's hand.\n\n\"Good-bye, Andy. This has been a pleasant meeting. Wish it could have\nbeen longer.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, old chap. Glad to have seen you. My love to George, if you\nget to Nazri. Give you three to one in half-crowns you won't get there\nto-night.\"\n\n\"Done,\" said Lewis. \"You shall pay when I see you next.\" And in the\nmost approved style of the hero of melodrama he lit a short pipe and\nwent off into Immensity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nTHE WAY TO NAZRI\n\n\nOur traveller did not reach Nazri that night for many reasons, of which\nthe chief shall be told. The way to Nazri is long and the way to Nazri\nis exceedingly rough. Leaving the table-land you plunge down a\ntrackless gully into the dry bed of a stream. Thence it is an hour's\nuneasy walking among stagnant pools and granite boulders to the foot of\nanother nullah which runs up to the heart of the hills. From this you\npick your way along the precipitous side of a mountain, and if your head\nis good and your feet sure, may come eventually to a place like the roof\nof the house, beyond which lies a thicket of thorn-bushes and the Nazri\ngully. At first sight the thing seems impossible, but by a bold man it\ncan be crossed either in the untanned Kashmir shoes or with the naked\nfeet.\n\nLewis had not gone a mile and had barely reached the dry watercourse,\nwhen the weather broke utterly in a storm of mist and fine rain. At\nother times this chill weather would have been a comfort, but here in\nthese lonely altitudes, with a difficult path before him, its result was\nto confound confusion. So long as he stuck to the stream he had some\nguidance; it was hard, even when the air was like a damp blanket, to\nmistake the chaos of boulder and shingle which meant the channel. But\nthe mist was close to him and wrapped him in like a quilt, and he looked\nin vain for the foot of the nullah he must climb. He tried keeping by\nthe edge and feeling his way, but it only landed him in a ditch of\nstagnant slime. The thing was too vexatious, and his temper went; and\nwith his temper his last chance of finding his road. When he had\nstumbled for what seemed hours he sat down on a boulder and whistled\ndismally. The stream belonged to another watershed. If he followed it,\nassuming that he did not break his neck over a dry cataract, he would be\nthrough the mountains and near Taghati quicker than he intended.\nMeantime the miserable George would wait at Nazri, would rouse the\nKhautmi garrison on a false alarm, and would find himself irretrievably\nseparated from his friend. The thought was so full of irritation, that\nhe resolved not to stir one step further. He would spend the night if\nneed be in this place and wait till the mist lifted.\n\nHe found a hollow among the boulders, and improvidently ate half his\nstore of sandwiches. Then, finding his throat dry, he got up to hunt\nfor water. A trickle afar off in the rocks led him on, and sure enough\nhe found water; but when he tried to retrace his steps to his former\nresting place he found that he had forgotten the way. This new place\nwas conspicuously less sheltered, but he sat down on the wet gravel, lit\na pipe with difficulty, and with his knees close to his chin strove to\npossess his soul in patience.\n\nHe was tired, for he had slept little for two days, and the closer air\nof the ravine made him drowsy. He had lost any sense of discomfort from\nthe wet, and was in the numb condition of the utterly drenched. He\ncould not spend the night like this, so he roused himself and stood\nstaring, pipe in teeth, into the drizzle. The mist seemed clearer. He\nwas a little stupid, so he did not hear the sound of feet on stones till\nthey were almost on him. Then through the haze he saw a procession of\nfigures moving athwart the channel. They were not his countrymen, for\nthey walked with the stoop forward which no Englishman can ever quite\nmaster in his hill-climbing. Lewis turned to flee, but in his numbness\nof mind and body missed footing, and fell sprawling over a bank of\nshingle. He scrambled to his feet only to find hands at his throat, and\nhimself a miserable prisoner.\n\nThe scene had shifted with a vengeance, and his first and sole impulse\nwas to laugh. It is possible that if the scarf of a brawny tribesman\nhad not been so tight across his chest he would have astonished his\ncaptors with hysterical laughter. But the jolt as he was dragged up\nhill, tied close to a horse's side, was unfavourable to merriment, and\nraw despondency filled his soul. This was the end of his fine doings.\nThe prisoner of unknown bandits, hurried he knew not whence, a pretty\npass for an adventurer. This was the seal on his ineffectiveness. Shot\nagainst a rock, held up to some sordid ransom, he was as impotent for\ngood or ill as if he had stayed at home. For a second he longed to pull\nhorse and captor with one wrench over the brink to the kindly gulf where\nall was quiet.\n\nThe bitterest ill-humour possessed this meekest of men. Normally he\nwould have been afraid, for he was an imaginative being who feared\nhorrors and had little relish for them. But there is a certain perfect\nbad temper which casteth out fear, and this held him in its grip. He\ncursed the mountain solitude and he cursed the Bada-Mawidi with awful\ndirectness. Then he chose silence as the easier part, and trudged like\na stolid criminal till, half in a daze of weariness and sleep, he found\nthat the cavalcade had halted.\n\nThe place was the edge of a little tableland where in a hollow among\nrocks lay a collection of mud-walled huts. A fire, in spite of the damp\nweather, blazed cheerfully in the midst of the clearing. There was\ncommotion in the huts, every door was opened, and evil-smelling people\npoured forth with cries and questions. The leader of the newly arrived\nparty bowed himself before a short, square man whom we have met before,\nand spoke something in his ear. Fazir Khan looked up sharply at Lewis,\nthen laughed, and spoke something to his men in his own tongue.\n\nLewis comprehended barely a few words of Chil, the Bada tongue, and he\nknew little of the frontier speeches. But to his amazement the chief\naddressed him in tolerable, if halting, English. It was not for nothing\nthat Fazir Khan had harried the Border and sojourned incognito in every\ntown in North India.\n\n\"Allah has given thee to us, my son,\" he said sweetly. \"It is vain to\nfight against God. I have heard of thee as the Englishman who would\nknow more than is good for man to know. You were at Forza to-day.\"\n\nLewis's temper was at its worst. \"I was at Forza to-day, and I watched\nyour people running. Had they waited a little longer we should have\nslain them all, and then have come for you.\"\n\nThe chief smiled unpleasantly. \"My people did not fight at Forza\nto-day. That was but the sport to draw on fools. Soon we shall fight\nin earnest, but in a different place, and thou shalt not see.\"\n\n\"I am your prisoner,\" said Lewis grimly, \"and it is in your power to do\nwith me as you please. But remember that for every hair of my head my\npeople will take the lives of four of your cattle-lifters.\"\n\n\"That is an old story,\" said Fazir Khan wearily, \"and I have heard it\nmany times before. You speak boldly like a man, and because you are not\nafraid I will tell you the truth. In a very little there will be not\none of your people in the land, only the Bada-Mawidi, and others whom I\ndo not name.\"\n\n\"That is a still older story. I have heard it since I was in my\nmother's arms. Do you think to frighten me by such a tale?\"\n\n\"Let us not talk of fear,\" said the chief with some politeness. \"There\nare two races in your people, one which talks and allies itself with\nBengalis and swine, and one which lives in hard places and follows war.\nThe second I love, and had it been possible, I would have allied myself\nwith it and driven the others into the sea.\" This petty chieftain spoke\nwith the pride of one who ruled the destinies of the earth.\n\nLewis was unimpressed. \"I am tired of your riddles,\" he said. \"If you\nwould kill me have done with it. If you would keep me prisoner, give me\nfood and a place to sleep. But if you would be merciful, let me go and\nshow me the way to Bardur. Life is too short for waiting.\"\n\nFazir Khan laughed loudly, and spoke something to his people.\n\n\"You shall join in our company for the night,\" he said. \"I have eaten\nof the salt of your people and I do not murder without cause. Also I\nlove a bold man.\"\n\nLewis was led into the largest of the huts and given food and warm Hunza\nwine. The place was hot to suffocation; large beads of moisture stood\non the mud walls, and the smell of uncleanly clothing and sweating limbs\nwas difficult to stand. But the man's complexion was hard, and he made\nan excellent supper. Thereafter he became utterly drowsy. He had it in\nhis mind to question this Fazir Khan about his dark sayings, but his\neyes closed as if drawn by a magnet and his head nodded. It may have\nbeen something in the wine; it may have been merely the vigil of the\nlast night, and the toil of the past hours. At any rate his mind was\nsoon a blank, and when a servant pointed out a heap of skins in a\ncorner, he flung himself on them and was at once asleep. He was utterly\nat their mercy, but his course, had he known it, was the wisest. Even a\nBada's treachery has its limits, and he will not knife a confident\nguest. The men talked and wrangled, ate and drank, and finally snored\naround him, but he slept through it all like a sleeper of Ephesus.\n\nWhen he woke the hut was cleared. The village slept late but he had\nslept later, for the sun was piercing the unglazed windows and making\npattern-work on the earth floor. He had slept soundly a sleep haunted\nwith nightmares, and he was still dazed as he peered out into the square\nwhere men were passing. He saw a sentry at the door of his hut, which\nreminded him of his condition. All the long night he had been far away,\nfishing, it seemed to him, in a curious place which was Glenavelin, and\nyet was ever changing to a stranger glen. It was moonlight, still,\nbright and warm on all the green hill shoulders. He remembered that he\ncaught nothing, but had been deliriously happy. People seemed passing\non the bank, Arthur and Wratislaw and Julia Heston, and all his\nboyhood's companions. He talked to them pleasantly, and all the while\nhe was moving up the glen which lay so soft in the moonlight. He\nremembered looking everywhere for Alice Wishart, but her face was\nwanting. Then suddenly the place seemed to change. The sleeping glen\nchanged to a black sword-cut among rocks, his friends disappeared, and\nonly George was left. He remembered that George cried out something and\npointed to the gorge, and he knew--though how he knew it he could not\ntell--that the lost Alice was somewhere there before him in the darkness\nand he must go towards her. Then he had wakened shivering, for in that\ndarkness there was terror as well as joy.\n\nHe went to the door, only to find himself turned back by the sheep-skin\nsentry, who half unsheathed for his benefit an ugly knife. He found\nthat his revolver, his sole weapon, had been taken while he slept.\nEscape was impossible till his captors should return.\n\nA day of burning sun had followed on the storm. Out of doors in the\nscorching glare from the rock there seemed an extraordinary bustle. It\nwas like the preparations for a march, save that there seemed no method\nin the activity. One man burnished a knife, a dozen were cleaning\nrifles, and all wore the evil-smelling finery with which the hillman\ndecks his person for war. Their long oiled hair was tied in a sort of\nrude knot, new and fuller turbans adorned the head, and on the feet were\nstout slippers of Bokhara make. Lewis had keen eyesight, and he strove\nto read the marks on the boxes of cartridges which stood in a corner.\nIt was not the well-known Government mark which usually brands stolen\nammunition. The three crosses with the crescent above--he had seen them\nbefore, but his memory failed him. It might have been at Bardur in the\ninn; it might have been at home in the house of some great traveller.\nAt any rate the sight boded no good to himself or the border peace. He\nthought of George waiting alone at Nazri, and then obediently warning\nthe people at Khautmi. By this time Andover would know he was missing,\nand men would be out on a very hopeless search. At any rate he had done\nsome good, for if the Badas meant marching they would find the garrisons\nprepared.\n\nAbout noon there was a bustle in the square and Fazir Khan with a dozen\nof his tail swaggered in. He came straight to the hut, and two men\nentered and brought out the prisoner. Lewis stiffened his back and\nprepared not reluctantly for a change in the situation. He had no\nspecial fear of this smiling, sinister chieftain. So far he had been\nspared, and now it seemed unlikely that in the midst of this bustle of\nwar there would be room for the torture which alone he dreaded. So he\nmet the chief's look squarely, and at the moment he thanked the lot\nwhich had given him two more inches of height.\n\n\"I have sent for thee, my son,\" said Fazir Khan, \"that you may see how\ngreat my people is.\"\n\n\"I have seen,\" said Lewis, looking round. \"You have a large collection\nof jackals, but you will not bring many back.\"\n\nThe notion tickled Fazir Khan and he laughed with great good-humour.\n\"So, so,\" he cried. \"Behold how great is the wisdom of youth. I will\ntell you a secret, my son. In a little the Bada-Mawidi, my people, will\nbe in Bardur and a little later in the fat corn lands of the south, and\nI, Fazir Khan, will sit in King's palaces.\" He looked contemptuously\nround at his mud walls, his heart swelling with pride.\n\n\"What the devil do you mean?\" Lewis asked with rising suspicion. This\nwas not the common talk of a Border cateran.\n\n\"I mean what I mean,\" said the other. \"In a little all the world shall\nsee. But because I have a liking for a bold cockerel like thee, I will\nspeak unwisely. The days of your people are numbered. This very night\nthere are those coming from the north who will set their foot on your\nnecks.\"\n\nLewis went sick at heart. A thousand half-forgotten suspicions called\nclamorously. This was the secret of the burlesque at Forza, and the new\nvalour of the Badas. He saw Marker's game with the fatal clearness of\none who is too late. He had been given a chance of a little piece of\nservice to avert his suspicions. Marker had fathomed him well as one\nwho must satisfy a restless conscience but had no stomach for anything\nbeyond. Doubtless he thought that now he would be enjoying the rest\nafter labour at Forza, flattering himself on saving a garrison, when all\nthe while the force poured down which was to destroy an empire. An army\nfrom the north, backed and guided by every Border half-breed and\noutlaw--what hope of help in God's name was to be found in the sleepy\nforts and the unsuspecting Bardur?\n\nAnd the Kashmir and the Punjab? A train laid in every town and village.\nSupplies in readiness, communications waiting to be held, railways ready\nfor capture. Europe was on the edge of a volcano. He saw an outbreak\nthere which would keep Britain employed at home, while the great power\nwith her endless forces and bottomless purse poured her men over the\nfrontier. But at the thought of the frontier he checked himself. There\nwas no road by which an army could march; if there was any it could be\nblocked by a handful. A week's, a day's delay would save the north, and\nthe north would save the empire.\n\nHis voice came out of his throat with a crack in it like an old man's.\n\n\"There is no road through the mountains. I have been there before and I\nknow.\"\n\nAgain Fazir Khan smiled. \"I use no secrecy to my friends. There is a\nway, though all men do not know it. From Nazri there is a valley\nrunning towards the sunrise. At the head there is a little ridge easily\ncrossed, and from that there is a dry channel between high precipices.\nIt is not the width of a man's stature, so even the sharp eyes of my\nbrother might miss it. Beyond that there is a sandy tableland, and then\nanother valley, and then plains.\"\n\nThe plan of the place was clear in Lewis's brain. He remembered each\ndetail. The long nullah on which he had looked from the hill-tops had,\nthen, an outlet, and did not end, as he had guessed, in a dead wall of\nrock. Fool and blind! to have missed so glorious a chance!\n\nHe stood staring dumbly around him, unconscious that he was the\nlaughingstock of all. Then he looked at the chief.\n\n\"Am I your prisoner?\" he asked hoarsely.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the other good-humouredly, \"thou art free. We have\nover-much work on hand to-day to be saddled with captives.\"\n\n\"Then where is Nazri?\" he asked.\n\nThe chief laughed a loud laugh of tolerant amusement. \"Hear to the bold\none,\" he cried. \"He will not miss the great spectacle. See, I will\nshow you the road,\" and he pointed out certain landmarks. \"For one of\nmy own people it is a journey of four hours; for thee it will be\nsomething more. But hurry, and haply the game will not have begun. If\nthe northern men take thee I will buy thy life.\"\n\nFour hours; the words rang in his brain like a sentence. He had no\nhope, but a wild craving to attempt the hopeless. George might have\nreturned to Nazri to wait; it was the sort of docile thing that George\nwould do. In any case not five miles from Nazri was the end of the\nnorth road and a little telegraph hut used by the Khautmi forts. The\nnight would be full moonlight; and by night the army would come. His\nwatch had been stolen, but he guessed by the heavens that it was some\ntwo hours after noon. Five hours would bring him to Nazri at six, in\nanother he might be at the hut before the wires were severed. It was a\ncrazy chance, but it was his all, and meanwhile these grinning tribesmen\nwere watching him like some curious animal. They had talked to him\nfreely to mock his feebleness. His dominant wish was to escape from\ntheir sight.\n\nHe turned to the descent. \"I am going to Nazri,\" he said.\n\nThe chief held out his pistol. \"Take your little weapon. We have no\nneed of such things when great matters are on hand. Allah speed you,\nbrother! A sure foot and a keen eye may bring you there in time for the\nsport.\" And, still laughing, he turned to enter the hut.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nEVENING IN THE HILLS\n\n\nThe airless heat of afternoon lay on the rocks and dry pastures. The\nfar snow-peaks, seen for a moment through a rift in the hills, shimmered\nin the glassy stillness. No cheerful sound of running water filled the\nhollows, for all was parched and bare with the violence of intemperate\nsuns and storms. Soon he was out of sight and hearing of the village,\ntravelling in a network of empty watercourses, till at length he came to\nthe long side of mountain which he knew of old as the first landmark of\nthe way. A thin ray of hope began to break up his despair. He knew now\nthe exact distance he had to travel, for his gift had always been an\ninfallible instinct for the lie of a countryside. The sun was still\nhigh in the heavens; with any luck he should be at Nazri by six o'clock.\n\nHe was still sore with wounded pride. That Marker should have divined\nhis weakness and left open to him a task in which he might rest with a\ncheap satisfaction was bitter to his vanity. The candour of his mind\nmade him grant its truth, but his new-born confidence was sadly\ndissipated. And he felt, too, the futility of his efforts. That one\nman alone in this precipitous wilderness should hope to wake the Border\nseemed a mere nightmare of presumption. But it was possible, he said to\nhimself. Time only was needed. If he could wake Bardur and the north,\nand the forts on the passes, there would be delay enough to wake India.\nIf George were at Nazri there would be two for the task; if not, there\nwould be one at least willing and able.\n\nIt was characteristic of the man that the invasion was bounded for him\nby Nazri and Bardur. He had no ears for ultimate issues and the ruin of\nan empire. Another's fancy would have been busy on the future; Lewis\nsaw only that pass at Nazri and the telegraph-hut beyond. He must get\nthere and wake the Border; then the world might look after itself. As\nhe ran, half-stumbling, along the stony hillside he was hard at work\nrecounting to himself the frontier defences. The Forza and Khautmi\ngarrisons might hold the pass for an hour if they could be summoned. It\nmeant annihilation, but that was in the bargain. Thwaite was strong\nenough in Bardur, but the town might give him trouble of itself, and he\nwas not a man of resources. After Bardur there was no need of thought.\nTwo hours after the telegraph clicked in the Nazri hut, the north of\nIndia would have heard the news and be bestirring itself for work. In\nfive hours all would be safe, unless Bardur could be taken and the wires\ncut. There might be treason in the town, but that again was not his\naffair. Let him but send the message before sunset, and he would still\nhave time to get to Khautmi, and with good luck hold the defile for\nsixty minutes. The thought excited him wildly. His face dripped with\nsweat, his boots were cut with rock till the leather hung in shreds, and\na bleeding arm showed through the rents in his sleeve. But he felt no\nphysical discomfort, only the exhilaration of a rock climber with the\nsummit in sight, or a polo player with a clear dribble before him to the\ngoal. At last he was playing a true game of hazard, and the chance gave\nhim the keenest joy.\n\nAll the hot afternoon he scrambled till he came to the edge of a new\nvalley. Nazri must lie beyond, he reasoned, and he kept to the higher\nground. But soon he was mazed among precipitous shelves which needed\nall his skill. He had to bring his long stride down to a very slow and\ncautious pace, and, since he was too old a climber to venture rashly, he\nmust needs curb his impatience. He suffered the dull recoil of his\nearlier vigour. While he was creeping on this accursed cliff the\nminutes were passing, and every second lessening his chances. He was in\na fever of unrest, and only a happy fortune kept him from death. But at\nlength the place was passed, and the mountain shelved down to a plateau.\nA wide view lay open to the eye, and Lewis blinked and hesitated. He\nhad thought Nazri lay below him, and lo! there was nothing but a tangle\nof black watercourses.\n\nThe sun had begun to decline over the farther peak, and the man's heart\nfailed him utterly. These unkind stony hills had been his ruin. He was\nlost in the most formidable country on God's earth, lost! when his\nwhole soul cried out for hurry. He could have wept with misery, and\nwith a drawn face he sat down and forced himself to think.\n\nSuddenly a long, narrow black cleft in the farther tableland caught his\neye. He took the direction from the sun and looked again. This must be\nthe Nazri Pass, which he had never before that day heard of. He saw\nwhere it ended in a stony valley. Once there he had but to follow the\nnullah and cross the little ridge to come to Nazri.\n\nWeariness was beginning to grow on him, but the next miles were the\nquickest of the day. He seemed to have the foot of a chamois. Down the\nrocky hillside, across the chaos of boulders, and up into the dark\nnullah he ran like a maniac. His mouth was parched with thirst, and he\nstopped for a moment in the valley bottom to swallow some rain-water.\nAt last he found himself in the Nazri valley, with the thin sword-cut\nshowing dark in the yellow evening. Another mile and he would be at the\ncamping-place, and in five more at the hut.\n\nHe kept high up on the ridge, for the light had almost gone and the\nvalley was perilous. It must be hideously late, eight o'clock or more,\nhe thought, and his despair made him hurry his very weary limbs.\nSuddenly in the distant hollow he saw the gleam of a fire. He stopped\nabruptly and then quickened with a cry of joy. It must be the faithful\nGeorge still waiting in the place appointed. Now there would be two to\nthe task. But it was too late, he bitterly reflected. In a little the\nmoon would rise, and then at any moment the van of the invader might\nemerge from the defile. He might warn Bardur, but before anything could\nbe done the enemy would be upon them. And then there would be a\nsouthward march upon a doubtful and half-awakened country, and then--he\nknew not.\n\nBut there was one other way. It had not occurred to him before, for it\nis not an expedient which comes often to men nowadays, save to such as\nare fools and outcasts. We are a wise and provident age, mercantile in\nour heroics, seeking a solid profit for every sacrifice. But this\nman--a child of the latter day--had not the new self-confidence, and he\nwas at the best high-strung, unwise, and unworldly. Besides, he was\nbroken with toil and excited with adventure. The last dying rays of the\nsun were resting on the far snow walls, and the great heart of the west\nburned in one murky riot of flame. But to the north, whence came\ndanger, there was a sea of yellow light, islanded with faint roseate\nclouds like some distant happy country. The air of dusk was thin and\nchill but stirring as wine to the blood, and all the bare land was for\nthe moment a fairy realm, mystic, intangible and untrodden. The\nfrontier line ran below the camping place; here he was over the border,\nbeyond the culture of his kind. He was alone, for in this adventure\nGeorge would not share. He would earn nothing, in all likelihood he\nwould achieve nothing; but by the grace of God he might gain some\nminutes' respite. He would be killed; but that, again, was no business\nof his. At least he could but try, for this was his one shred of hope\nremaining.\n\nThe thought, once conceived, could not be rejected. He was no coward or\nsophist to argue himself out of danger. He laid no flattering unction\nto his soul that he had done his best while another way remained\nuntried. For this type of man may be half-hearted and a coward in\nlittle matters, but he never deceives himself. We have all our own\nvirtues and their defects. I am a well-equipped and confident person,\nwalking bluffly through the world, looking through and down upon my\nneighbours, the incarnation of honesty; but I can find excuses for\nmyself when I desire them, I hug my personal esteem too close, and a\nthousand to one I am too great a coward at heart to tell myself the\nnaked truth. You, on the other hand, are vacillating and ill at your\nease. You shrink from the hards of life which I steer happily through.\nBut you have no delusions with yourself, and the odds are that when the\ntime comes you may choose the \"high that proved too high\" and achieve\nthe impossibly heroic.\n\nA tired man with an odd gleam in his eye came out of the shadows to the\nfirelight and called George by name.\n\n\"My God, Lewis, I am glad to see you! I thought you were lost. Food?\"\nand he displayed the resources of his larder.\n\nLewis hunted for the water-bottle and quenched his thirst. Then he ate\nravenously of the cold wild-fowl and oatcake which George had provided.\nHe was silent and incurious till he had satisfied his wants; then he\nlooked up to meet George's questions.\n\n\"Where on earth have you been? Andover said you started out to come\nhere last night. I did as you told me, you know, and when you didn't\ncome I roused the Khautmi people. They swore a good deal but turned\nout, and after an infernal long climb we got to Forza. We roused up\nAndover after a lot of trouble, and he took us in and gave us supper.\nHe said you had gone off hours ago, and that the Bada-Mawidi business\nhad been more or less of a fraud. So I slept there and came back here\nin the morning in case you should turn up. Been shooting all day, but\nit was lonely work and I didn't get the right hang of the country.\nThese beggars there are jolly little use,\" and he jerked his head in the\ndirection of the native servants. \"What _have_ you been after?\"\n\n\"I? Oh, I've been in queer places. I fell into the hands of the Badas\na couple of hours after I left Forza. There was a storm up there and I\ngot lost in the mist. They took me up to a village and kept me there\nall night. And then I heard news--my God, such news! They let me go\nbecause they thought I could do no harm and I ran most of the way here.\nMarker has scored this time, old man. You know how he has been going\nabout all North India for the last year or two getting things much his\nown way. Well, to-night when the moon rises the great blow is to be\nstruck. It seems there is a pass to the north of this; I knew the place\nbut I didn't know of the road. There is an army coming down that place\nin an hour or so. It is the devil's own business, but it has got to be\nfaced. We must warn Bardur, and trust to God that Bardur may warn the\nsouth. You know the telegraph hut at the end of the road, when you\nbegin to climb up the ravine to the place? You must get down there at\nonce, for every moment is precious.\"\n\nGeorge had listened with staring eyes to the tale. \"I can't believe\nit,\" he managed to ejaculate. \"God, man! it's invasion, an unheard-of\nthing!\"\n\n\"It's the most desperate truth, unheard-of or no. The whole thing lies\nin our hands. They cannot come till after midnight, and by that time\nThwaite may be ready in Bardur, and the Khautmi men may be holding the\nroad. That would delay them for a little, and by the time they took\nBardur they might find the south in arms. It wouldn't matter a straw if\nit were an ordinary filibustering business. But I tell you it's a great\narmy, and everything is prepared for it. Marker has been busy for\nmonths. There will be outbreaks in every town in the north. The\nrailways and arsenals will be captured before ever the enemy appears.\nThere will be a native rising. That was to be bargained for. But God\nonly knows how the native troops have been tampered with. That man was\nas clever as they make, and he has had a free hand. Oh the blind\nfools!\"\n\nGeorge had turned, and was buttoning the top button of his shooting-coat\nagainst the chilly night wind. \"What shall I say to Thwaite?\" he\nasked.\n\n\"Oh, anything. Tell him it's life or death. Tell him the facts, and\ndon't spare. You'll have to impress on the telegraph clerk its\nimportance first and that will take time. Tell him to send to Gilgit\nand Srinagar, and then to the Indus Valley. He must send into Chitral\ntoo and warn Armstrong. Above all things the Kohistan railway must be\nwatched, because it must be their main card. Lord! I wish I understood\nthe game better. Heaven knows it isn't my profession. But Thwaite will\nunderstand if you scare him enough. Tell him that Bardur must be held\nready for siege at any moment. You understand how to work the thing?\"\n\nGeorge nodded. \"There'll be nobody there, so I suppose I'll have to\nbreak the door open. I think I remember the trick of the business.\n_Then_, what do I do?\"\n\n\"Get up to Khautmi as fast as you can shin it. Better take the servants\nand send them before you while you work the telegraph. I suppose\nthey're trustworthy. Get them to warn Mitchinson and St. John. They\nmust light the fires on the hills and collect all the men they can spare\nto hold the road. Of course it's a desperate venture. We'll probably\nall be knocked on the head, but we must risk it. If we can stop the\nbeggars for one half-hour we'll give Thwaite a better chance to set his\nhouse in order. How I'd sell my soul to see a strong man in Bardur!\nThat will be the key of the position. If the place is uncaptured\nto-morrow morning, and your wires have gone right, the chief danger on\nthis side will be past. There will be little risings of wasps' nests up\nand down the shop, but we can account for them if this army from the\nnorth is stopped.\"\n\n\"I wonder how many of us will see to-morrow morning,\" said George\ndismally. He was not afraid of death, but he loved the pleasant world.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" said Lewis abruptly, holding out his hand.\n\nThe action made George realize for the first time the meaning of his\nerrand.\n\n\"But, I say, Lewie, hold on. What the deuce are you going to do?\"\n\n\"I am dog-tired,\" said the impostor. \"I must wait here and rest. I\nshould only delay you.\" And always, as if to belie his fatigue, his eyes\nwere turning keenly to the north. At any moment while he stood there\nbandying words there might come the sound of marching, and the van of\nthe invaders issue from the defile.\n\n\"But, hang it, you know. I can't allow this. The Khautmi men mayn't\nreach you in time, and I'm dashed if I am going to leave you here to be\nchawed up by Marker. You're coming with me.\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass,\" said Lewis kindly. This parting, one in ignorance,\nthe other in too certain knowledge, was very bitter. \"They can't be here\nbefore midnight. They were to start at moonrise, and the moon is only\njust up. You'll be back in heaps of time, and, besides, we'll soon all\nbe in the same box.\"\n\nIt was a false card to play, for George grew obstinate at once. \"Then\nI'm going to be in the same box as you from the beginning. Do you\nreally think I am going to desert you? Hang it, you're more important\nthan Bardur.\"\n\n\"Oh, for God's sake, listen to reason,\" Lewis cried in despair. \"You\nmust go at once. I can't or I would. It's our only chance. It's a\njolly good chance of death anyway, but it's a naked certainty unless you\ndo this. Think of the women and children and the people at home. You\nmay as well talk about letting the whole thing slip and getting back to\nBardur with safe skins. We must work the telegraph and then try to hold\nthe road with the Khautmi men, or be cowards for evermore. We're\ngentlemen, and we are responsible.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean it that way,\" said George dismally. \"But I want you to\ncome with me. I can't bear the thought of your being butchered here\nalone, supposing the beggars come before we get back. You're sure there\nis time?\"\n\n\"You've three hours before you, but every moment is important. This is\nthe frontier line, and this fire will do for one of the signals. You'll\nfind me here. I haven't slept for days.\" And he yawned with feigned\ndrowsiness.\n\n\"Then--good-bye,\" said George solemnly, holding out his hand a second\ntime. \"Remember, I'm devilish anxious about you. It's a pretty hot job\nfor us all; but, gad! if we pull through you get the credit.\"\n\nThen with a single backward glance he led the way down the narrow track,\ntwo mystified servants at his heels.\n\nLewis watched him disappear, and then turned sadly to his proper\nbusiness. This was the end of a very old song, and his heart cried out\nat the thought. He heaped more wood on the blaze from the little pile\ncollected, and soon a roaring, boisterous fire burned in the glen, while\ngiant shadows danced on the sombre hills. Then he rummaged in the tent\ntill he found the rifles, carefully cleaned and laid aside. He selected\ntwo express 400 bores, a Metford express and a smooth-bore Winchester\nrepeater. Then he filled his pockets with cartridges, and from a small\nbox took a handful for his revolver. All this he did in a sort of\nsobbing haste, turning nervous eyes always to the mouth of the ca\u00c3\u00b1on.\nHe filled his flask from a case in the tent, and, being still ravenously\nhungry, crammed the remnants of supper into a capacious game-pocket.\nThen, all preparations being made, he looked for a moment down the road\nwhere his best friend had just gone out of his ken for ever. The\nthought was so dreary that he did not dare to delay longer, but with a\nbundle of ironmongery below his arms began to scramble up the glen to\nwhere the north star burned between two peaks of hill.\n\nHe did the journey in an hour, for he was in a pitiable state of\nanxiety. Every moment he looked to hear the tramp of an army before\nhim, and know his errand of no avail. Over the little barrier ridge he\nscrambled, and then up the straight gully to the little black rift which\nwas the gate of an empire. His unquiet mind peopled the wilderness with\nvoices, but when, breathless and sore, he came into the jaws of the\npass, all was still, silent as the grave, save for an eagle which\ncroaked from some eyrie in the cliffs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nEVENTS SOUTH OF THE BORDER\n\n\nThwaite was finishing a solitary dinner and attempting to find interest\nin a novel when his butler came with news that the telephone bell was\nringing in the gun-room. Thwaite, being tired and cross, told him to\nanswer it himself, expecting some frivolous message about supplies. The\nman returned in a little with word that he could not understand it.\nThen Thwaite arose, blessing him, and went to see. The telegraph office\nproper was on the other side of the river, on the edge of the native\ntown, but a telephone had been established to the garrison.\n\nThwaite's first impulse was to suspect a gigantic hoax. A scared native\nclerk was trying to tell him a most appalling tale. George had not\nspared energy in his message, and the Oriental imagination as a medium\nhad considerably increased it. The telegrams came in a confused order,\nhard to piece together, but two facts seemed to stand out from the\nconfusion. One was that there was an unknown pass in the hills beyond\nNazri through which danger was expected at any moment that night; the\nother was that treason was suspected throughout the whole north. Then\ncame the name of Marker, which gave Thwaite acute uneasiness. Finally\ncame George's two words of advice--keep strict watch on the native town\nand hold Bardur in readiness for a siege; and wire the same directions\nto Yasin, Gilgit, Chitral, Chilas, and throughout Kashmir and the\nPunjab. Above all, wire to the chief places on the new Indus Valley\nrailway, for in case of success in Bardur, the railway would be the\nfirst object of the invader.\n\nThwaite put down the ear-trumpet, his face very white and perspiring.\nHe looked at his watch; it was just on nine o'clock. The moon had\narisen and the telegram said \"moonrise.\" He could not doubt the\ngenuineness of the message when he had heard at the end the names\nWinterham and Haystoun. Already Marker might be through the pass, and\nlittle the Khautmi people could do against him. He must be checked at\nBardur, though it cost every life in the garrison. Four hours' delay\nwould arm the north to adequate resistance.\n\nHe telephoned to the telegraph office to shut and lock the doors and\nadmit no one till word came from him. Then he summoned his Sikh\norderly, his English servant, and the native officers of the garrison.\nHe had one detachment of Imperial Service troops officered by Punjabis,\nand a certain force of Kashmir Sepoys who made ineffective policemen,\nand as soldiers were worse than useless. And with them he had to defend\nthe valley, and hold the native town, which might give trouble on his\nflank. This was the most vexatious part of the business. If Marker had\norganized the thing, then nothing could be unexpected, and treachery was\nsure to be thick around them.\n\nThe men came, saluted, and waited in silence. Thwaite sat down at a\ntable and pulled a sheaf of telegraph forms to pieces. First he wired\nto Ladcock at Gilgit, beseeching reinforcements. From Bardur to the\nsouth there is only one choice of ways--by Yasin and Yagistan to the\nIndus Valley, or by Gilgit and South Kashmir. Once beyond Gilgit there\nwas small hope of checking an advance, but in case the shorter way to\nthe Indus by the Astor Valley was tried there might be hope of a delay.\nSo he besought Ladcock to post men on the Mazeno Pass if the time was\ngiven him. Then he sent a like message to Yasin, though on the high\npasses and the unsettled country there was small chance of the wires\nremaining uncut. A force in Yasin might take on the flank any invasion\nfrom Afghanistan and in any case command the Chitral district. Then\ncame a series of frantic wires at random--to Rawal Pindi, to the Punjabi\ncentres, to South Kashmir. He had small confidence in these messages.\nIf the local risings were serious, as he believed them to be, they would\nbe too late, and in any case they were beyond the country where\nstrategical points were of advantage against an invader. There remained\nthe stations on the Indus Valley railway, which must be\nthe earliest point of attack. The terminus at Boonji was held by a\ncertain Jackson, a wise man who inspired terror in a mixed force of\nirregulars, Afridis, Pathans, Punjabis, Swats, and a dozen other\nvarieties of tribesmen. To him he sent the most lengthy and urgent\nmessages, for he held the key of a great telegraphic system with which\nhe might awake Abbotabad and the Punjab. Then, perspiring with heat and\nanxiety, he gave the bundle into the hands of his English servant, and\ntold off an officer and twenty men to hold the telegraph office. A blue\nlight was to be lit in the window if the native town should prove\ntroublesome and reinforcements be needed.\n\nSoon the force of the garrison was assembled in the yard, all but a few\nwho had been sent on messages to the more isolated houses of the English\nresidents. Thwaite addressed them briefly: \"Men, there's the devil's\nown sweet row up the north, and it's moving down to us. This very night\nwe may have to fight. And, remember, it's not the old game with the\nhillmen, but an army of white men, servants of the Tsar, come to fight\nthe servants of the Empress. Therefore, it is your duty to kill them\nall like locusts, else they will swallow up you and your cattle and your\nwives and your children, and, speaking generally, the whole bally show.\nWe may be killed, but if we keep them back even for a little God will\nbless us. So be steady at your posts.\"\n\nThe garrison was soon dispersed, the guns in readiness, pointing up the\nvalley. It was ten o'clock by Thwaite's watch ere the last click of the\nloaders told that Bardur was awaiting an enemy. The town behind was in\nan uproar, men clamouring at the gates, and seeking passports to flee to\nthe south. Chinese and Turcoman traders from Leh and Lhassa, Yarkand\nand Bokhara, with scared faces, were getting their goods together and\ninvoking their mysterious gods. Logan, who had returned from Gilgit\nthat very day, rode breathless into the yard, clamouring for Thwaite.\nHe received the tale in half a dozen sentences, whistled, and turned to\ngo, for he had his own work to do. One question he asked:\n\n\"Who sent the telegrams?\"\n\n\"Haystoun and Winterham.\"\n\n\"Then they're alone at Nazri?\"\n\n\"Except for the Khautmi men.\"\n\n\"Will they try to hold it?\"\n\n\"I should think so. They're all sportsmen. Gad, there won't be a soul\nleft alive.\"\n\nLogan galloped off with a long face. It would be a great ending, but\nwhat a waste of heroic stuff! And as he remembered Lewis's frank\ngood-fellowship he shut his lips, as if in pain.\n\nThe telegrams were sent, and reply messages began to pour in, which kept\none man at the end of the telephone. About half-past ten a blue light\nburned in the window across the river. There seemed something to do in\nthe native town of narrow streets and evil-smelling lanes, for the sound\nof shouting and desultory firing rose above the stir of the fort. The\ntelegraph office abutted on the far end of the bridge, and Thwaite had\ntaken the precaution of bidding the native officer he had sent across\nkeep his men posted around the end of the passage. Now he himself took\nthirty men, for the native town was the most dangerous point he had to\nfear. The wires must not be cut till the last moment, and, as they\npassed over the bridge and then through the English quarter, there was\nsmall danger if the office was held. He found, as he expected, that the\nplace was being maintained against considerable odds. A huge mixed\ncrowd, drawn in the main from the navvies who had been employed on the\nnew road, armed with knives and a few rifles, and encouraged by certain\nwild, dancing figures which had the look of priests, was surging around\nthe gate. The fighting stuff was Afridi or Chitrali, but there was\nabundance of yelling from this rabble of fakirs and beggars who\naccompanied them. Order there was none, and it was clear to Thwaite\nthat this rising had been arranged for but not organized. His men had\nsmall difficulty in forcing a way to the office, where they served to\ncomplete the cordon of defence and the garrison of the bridge-end. Two\nmen had been killed and some half-dozen of the rioters. He pushed into\nthe building, and found a terrified Kashmir clerk sternly watched by his\nservant and the Sikh orderly. The man, with tears streaming down his\nface, was attempting to read the messages which the wires brought.\n\nThwaite picked up and read the latest, which was a scrawl in quavering\ncharacters over three telegraph forms. It was from Ladcock at Gilgit,\nsaying that he was having a row of his own with the navvies there, and\nthat he could send no reinforcements at present. If he quieted the\ntrouble in time he would try and hold the Mazeno Pass, and meanwhile he\nhad done his best to wake the Punjab. As the wires would be probably\ncut within the next hour there would be no more communications, but he\nbesought Thwaite to keep the invader in the passes, as the whole south\ncountry was a magazine waiting for a spark to explode. The message ran\nin short violent words, and Thwaite had a vision of Ladcock, short,\nruddy, and utterly out of temper, stirred up from his easy life to hold\na frontier.\n\nThere was no word from Yasin, as indeed he had expected, for the tribes\non the highlands about Hunza and Punial were the most disaffected on the\nBorder, and doubtless the first to be tampered with. Probably his own\nmessage had never gone, and he could only pray that the men there might\nby the grace of God have eyes in their heads to read the signs of the\ntimes. There was a brief word from Jackson at Boonji. There attacks\nhad been made on the terminus and the engine-sheds since sunset, which\nhis men had luckily had time to repulse. A large amount of\nrolling-stock was lying there, as five freight trains had brought up\nmaterial for the new bridge the day before. Of this the enemy had\nprobably had word. Anyhow, he hoped to quiet all local disturbances,\nand he would undertake to see that every station on the line was warned.\nHe would receive reinforcements from Abbotabad by the afternoon of the\nnext day; if Bardur and Gilgit, or Yasin as it might be, could delay the\nattack till then everything might be safe--unless, indeed, the whole\nnexus of hill-tribes rose as one man. In which case there would be the\ndevil to pay, and he had no advice to give.\n\nThwaite read and laughed grimly. It was not a question of a day's\ndelay, but of an hour's, and the hill-tribes, if he judged Marker's\ncleverness rightly, would act just as Jackson feared. The business had\nbegun among the navvies at Bardur and Gilgit and Boonji. In a little\nthey would have news of real tribal war--Hunzas, Pathans, Chitralis,\nPunialis, and Chils, tribes whom England had fought a dozen times before\nand knew the mettle of; now would be the time for their innings. Well\nsupplied with money and arms--this would have been part of Marker's\nbusiness--they would be the forerunners of the great army. First savage\nwar, then scientific annihilation by civilized hands--a sweet prospect\nfor a peaceful man in the prime of life!\n\nHe returned to the fort to find all quiet and in order. It commanded\nthe north road, but though the eye might weary itself with looking on\nthe moonlit sandy valley and the opaque blue hills, there was no sight\nor sound of men. The stars were burning hard and cold in the vault of\nsky, and looking down somewhere on the march of an army. It was now\nclose on midnight; in five hours dawn would break in the east and the\nnight of attack would be gone. But death waited between this midnight\nhour and the morning. What were Haystoun and the men from Khautmi\ndoing? Fighting or beyond all fighting? Well, he would soon know. He\nwas not afraid, but this cursed waiting took the heart out of a man!\nAnd he looked at his watch and found it half-past twelve.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nAt Yasin there was the most severe fighting. It lasted for three days,\nand in effect amounted to a little tribal war. A man called Mackintosh\ncommanded, and he had the advantage of having regulars with him, Gurkhas\nfor the most part, who were old campaigners. The place had seemed\nunquiet for some days, and certain precautions had been taken, so that\nwhen the rioting broke out at sunset it was easy to get the town under\nsubjection and prepare for external attack. The Chiling Pass into\nChitral had given trouble of old, but Mackintosh was scarcely prepared\nfor the systematic assaults of Punialis and Tangiris from the east and\nsouth. Having always been famous as an alarmist he put the right\ninterpretation on the business, and settled down to what he half hoped,\nhalf feared, might be a great frontier war. The place was strong only\non the north side, and the defence was as much a question of engineering\nas of war. His Sepoys toiled gallantly at the incomplete defences,\nwhile the rest fought hand to hand--bayonet against knife, Metford\nagainst Enfield--to cover their labour. He lost many men, but on the\nevening of the next day he had the satisfaction of seeing the\nfortifications complete, and he awaited a siege with equanimity, as he\nwas well victualled.\n\nOn the second night the enemy again attacked, but the moon was bright,\nand they were no match for his sharpshooters. About two in the morning\nthey fell back, and for the next day it looked as if they proposed to\ninvest the garrison. But by the third evening they began to melt away,\ntaking with them such small plunder as they had won. Mackintosh, who\nwas a man of enterprise, told off a detachment for pursuit, and cursed\nbitterly the fate which had broken his ankle with a rifle-bullet.\n\nIn the south along the railway the warnings came in good time. At Rawal\nPindi there was some small difficulty with native officials, a large\nbody of whom seemed to have unaccountably disappeared. This delayed for\nsome time the sending of a freight-train to Abbotabad, but by and by\nsubstitutes were found, and the works left under guard. The telegram to\nPeshawur found things in readiness there, for memories of old trouble\nstill linger, and people sleep lightly on that frontier. Word came of\nnative riots in the south, at Lahore and Amritsar, and the line of towns\nwhich mark the way to Delhi. In some places extraordinary accidents\nwere reported. Certain officers had gone off on holiday and had not\nreturned; odd and unintelligible commands had come to perplex the minds\nof others; whole camps were reported sick where sickness was least\nexpected. A little rising of certain obscure rivers had broken up an\nimportant highway by destroying all the bridges save the one which\ncarried the railway. The whole north was on the brink of a sudden\ndisorganization, but the brink had still to be passed. It lay with its\nmasters to avert calamity; and its masters, going about with haggard\nfaces, prayed for daylight and a few hours to prepare.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nGeorge had sent his men to Khautmi before he entered the telegraph hut,\nand he followed himself in twenty minutes. Somewhere upon the hill-road\nhe met St. John with a dozen men, who abused him roundly and besought\ndetails.\n\n\"Are you sure?\" he cried. \"For God's sake, say you're mistaken. For,\nif you're not, upon my soul it's the last hour for all of us.\"\n\nGeorge was in little mood for jest. He told Lewis's tale in a few\nwords.\n\n\"A pass beyond Nazri,\" the man cried. \"Why, I was there shooting buck\nlast week. Up the nullah and over the ridge, and then a cleft at the\ntop of the next valley? Does he say there's a pass there? Maybe, but\nI'll be hanged if an army could get through. If we get there we can\nhold it.\"\n\n\"We haven't time. They may be here at any moment. Send men to Forza\nand get them to light the fires. Oh, for God's sake, be quick! I've\nleft Haystoun down there. The obstinate beggar was too tired to move.\"\n\nOver all the twenty odd miles between Forza and Khautmi there is a chain\nof fires which can be used for signals in the Border wars. On this\nnight Khautmi was to take the west side of the Nazri gully and Forza the\neast, and the two quickest runners in the place were sent off to Andover\nwith the news. He was to come towards them, leaving men at the\ndifferent signal-posts in case of scattered assaults, and if he came in\ntime the two forces would join in holding the Nazri pass. But should\nthe invader come before, then it fell on the Khautmi men to stand alone.\nIt was a smooth green hollow in the stony hills, some hundred yards\nwide, and at the most they might hope to make a fight of thirty minutes.\nSt. John and George, with their men, ran down the stony road till the\nsweat dripped from their brows, though the night was chilly. Mitchinson\nwas to follow with the rest and light the fires; meantime, they must get\nto Nazri, in case the march should forestall them. St. John was\ncursing his ill-luck. Two hours earlier and they might have held the\ndistant cleft in the hills, and, if they were doomed to perish, have\nperished to some purpose. But the holding of the easy Nazri pass was\nsheer idle mania, and yet it was the only chance of gaining some paltry\nminutes. As for George, he had forgotten his vexatious. His one\nanxiety was for Lewis; that he should be in time to have his friend at\nhis side. And when at last they came down on the pass and saw the\ncamp-fire blazing fiercely and no trace of the enemy, he experienced a\nsense of vast relief. Lewis was making himself comfortable, cool beggar\nthat he was, and now was probably sleeping. He should be left alone; so\nhe persuaded St. John that the best point to take their stand on was on\na shoulder of hill beyond the fire. It gave him honest pleasure to\nthink that at last he had stolen a march on his friend. He should at\nleast have his sleep in peace before the inevitable end.\n\nHe looked at his watch; it was almost half-past eleven.\n\n\"Haystoun said they'd be here at midnight,\" he whispered to his\ncompanion. \"We haven't long. When do you suppose Andover will come?\"\n\n\"Not for an hour and a half at the earliest. Afraid this is going to be\nour own private show. Where's Haystoun?\"\n\nGeorge nodded back to the fire in the hollow, and the tent beside it.\n\"There, I expect, sleeping. He's dog-tired, and he always was a very\ncool hand in a row. He'll be wakened soon enough, poor chap.\"\n\n\"You're sure he can't tell us anything?\"\n\n\"Nothing. He told me all. Better let him be.\" Mitchinson came up with\nthe rearguard. Living all but alone in the wilds had made him a silent\nman compared to whom the taciturn St. John was garrulous. He nodded to\nGeorge and sat down.\n\n\"How many are we?\" George asked.\n\n\"Forty-three, counting the three of us. Not enough for a good stand.\nWonder how it'll turn out. Never had to do such a thing before.\"\n\nSt. John, whose soul longed for Maxims, posted his men as best he\ncould. There was no time to throw up earthworks, but a rough cairn of\nstone which stood in the middle of the hollow gave at least a central\nrallying-ground. Then they waited, watching the fleecy night vapours\nblow across the peaks and straining their ears for the first sound of\nmen.\n\nGeorge grew impatient. \"It can't be more than five miles to the pass.\nShouldn't some of us try to get there? It would make all the\ndifference.\"\n\nSt. John declined sharply. \"We've taken our place and we must stick to\nit. We can't afford to straggle. Hullo! it's just on twelve. Thwaite\nhas had three hours to prepare, and he's bound to have wakened the\nsouth. I fancy the business won't quite come off this time.\"\n\nSuddenly in the chilly silence there rose something like the faint and\ndistant sound of rifles. It was no more than the sound of stone\ndropping on a rock ledge, for, still and clear and cold though the night\nwas, the narrowness of the valley and the height of the cliffs dulled\nall distant sounds. But each man had the ear of the old hunter, and\nwaited with head bent forward.\n\nAgain the drip-drip; then a scattering noise as when one lets peas fall\non the floor.\n\n\"God! That's carbines. Who the devil are they fighting with?\"\nMitchinson's eye had lost its lethargy. His scraggy neck was craned\nforward, and his grim mouth had relaxed into a grimmer smile.\n\n\"It's them, sure enough,\" said St. John, and spoke something to his\nservant.\n\n\"I'm going forward,\" said George. \"It may be somebody else making a\nstand, and we're bound to help.\"\n\n\"You're bound not to be an ass,\" said St. John. \"Who in the Lord's\nname could it be? It may be the Badas polishing off some hereditary\nfoes, and it may be Marker getting rid of some wandering hillmen. Man,\nwe're miles beyond the pale. Who's to make a stand but ourselves?\"\n\nAgain came the patter of little sounds, and then a long calm.\n\n\"They're through now,\" said St. John. \"The next thing to listen for is\nthe sound of their feet. When that comes I pass the word along. We're\nall safe for heaven, so keep your minds easy.\"\n\nBut the sound of feet was long in coming. Only the soft night airs, and\nat rare intervals an eagle's cry, or the bleat of a doe from the valley\nbottom. The first half-hour of waiting was a cruel strain. In such\nmoments a man's sins rise up large before him. When his future life is\nnarrowed down to an hour's compass, he sees with cruel distinctness the\nfollies of his past. A thousand things he had done or left undone\nloomed on George's mental horizon. His slackness, his self-indulgence,\nhis unkindness--he went over the whole innocent tale of his sins. To\nthe happy man who lives in the open and meets the world with a square\nfront this forced final hour of introspection has peculiar terrors.\nMeantime Lewis was sleeping peacefully in the tent by the still cheerful\nfire. Thank God, he was spared this hideous waiting!\n\nAbout two Andover turned up with fifteen men, hot and desperate. He\nlistened to St. John's story in silence.\n\n\"Thank God, I'm in time. Who found out this? Haystoun? Good man,\nLewis! I wonder who has been firing out there. They can't have been\nstopped? It's getting devilish late for them anyhow, and I believe\nthere's a little hope. It would be too risky to leave this pass, but I\nvote we send a scout.\"\n\nA man was chosen and dispatched. Two hours later he returned to the\nmystified watchers at Nazri. He had been on the hill-shoulder and\nlooked into the cleft. There was no sign of men there, but he had heard\nthe sound of men, though where he could not tell. Far down the cleft\nthere was a gleam of fire, but no man near it.\n\n\"That's a Bada dodge,\" said Andover promptly. \"Now I wonder if Marker\ntrusted too much to these gentry, and they have done us the excellent\nservice of misleading him. They hate us like hell, and they'd sell\ntheir souls any day for a dozen cartridges; so it can't have been done\non purpose. Seems to me there has been a slip in his plans somewhere.\"\n\nBut the sound of voices! The man was questioned closely, and he was\nstrong on its truth. He was a hillman from the west of the Khyber, and\nhe swore that he knew the sound of human speech in the hills many miles\noff, though he could not distinguish the words.\n\n\"In thirty minutes it will be morning,\" said George. \"Lord, such a\nnight, and Lewis to have missed it all!\" His spirits were rising, and he\nlit a pipe. The north was safe whatever happened, and, as the inertness\nof midnight passed off, he felt satisfaction in any prospect, however\nhazardous. He sat down beneath a boulder and smoked, while Andover\ntalked with the others. They were the frontier soldiers, and this was\ntheir profession; he was the amateur to whom technicalities were\nunmeaning.\n\nSuddenly he sprang up and touched St. John on the shoulder. A great\nchill seemed to have passed over the world, and on the hill-tops there\nwas a faint light. Both men looked to the east, and there, beyond the\nForza hills, was the red foreglow spreading over the grey. It was dawn,\nand with the dawn came safety. The fires had burned low, and the\nvagrant morning winds were beginning to scatter the white ashes. Now\nwas the hour for bravado, since the time for silence had gone. St.\nJohn gave the word, and it was passed like a roll-call to left and\nright, the farthest man shouting it along the ribs of mountain to the\nnext watch-fire. The air had grown clear and thin, and far off the dim\nrepetition was heard, which told of sentries at their place, and the\nline of posts which rimmed the frontier.\n\nMitchinson moistened his dry lips and filled his lungs with the cold,\nfresh air. \"That,\" he said slowly, \"is the morning report of the last\noutpost of the Empire, and by the grace of God it's 'All's well.'\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTHE BLESSING OF GAD\n\n\n\"Gad--a troop shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last.\"\n\nLewis peered into the gorge and saw only a thin darkness. The high\nwalls made pits of shade at the foot, but above there was a misty column\nof light which showed the spectres of rock and bush in the nullah\nbeyond. It was all but dark, and the stars were coming out like the\nlights on a sea-wall, hard and cold and gleaming. Just in the throat of\nthe pass a huge boulder had fallen and left a passage not two yards\nwide. Beyond there was a sharp descent of a dozen feet to the gravelled\nbottom which fell away in easier stages to the other watershed. Here\nwas a place made by nature for his plans. With immense pains he rolled\nthe biggest stones he could move to the passage, so that they were\npoised above the slope. He tried the great boulder, too, with his\nshoulders, and it seemed to quiver. In the last resort this mass of\nrock might be sent crashing down the incline, and by the blessing of God\nit should account for its man.\n\nHe brought his rifles forward to the stones, loaded them and felt the\ncartridges easy in his pocket. They were for the thirty-yards range;\nhis pistol would be kept for closer quarters. He tried one after the\nother, cuddling the stocks to his cheek. They were all dear-loved\nweapons, used in deer-stalking at home and on many a wilder beat. He\nknew the tricks of each, and he had little pet devices laughed at by his\nfriends. This one had clattered down fifty feet of rock in Ross-shire\nas the scars on the stock bore witness, and another had his initials\nburned in the wood, the relic of a winter's night in a Finnish camp. A\nthousand old pleasant memories came back to him, the sights and scents\nand sounds of forgotten places, the zest of toil and escapade, the joy\nof food and warmth and rest. Well! he had lived, had tasted to the\nfull the joys of the old earth, the kindly mother of her children. He\nhad faced death thoughtlessly many times, and now the Ancient Enemy was\non his heels and he was waiting to give him greeting. A phrase ran in\nhis head, some trophy from his aimless wanderings among books, which\nspoke of death coming easily to one \"who has walked steadfastly in the\ndirection of his dreams.\" It was a comforting thought to a creature of\nmoods and fancies. He had failed, doubtless, but he had ever kept some\nselect fanciful aim unforgotten. In all his weakness he had never\nbetrayed this ultimate Desire of the Heart.\n\nSome few feet up the cliff was a little thicket of withered thorns. The\nair was chilly and the cleft was growing very black. Why should not he\nmake a fire behind the great boulder? He gathered some armfuls and\nheaped them in a space of dry sand. They were a little wet, so they\nburned slowly with a great smoke, which the rising night wind blew\nbehind him. He was still hungry, so he ate the food he had brought in\nhis pockets; and then he lit his pipe. How oddly the tobacco tasted in\nthis moment of high excitement! It was as if the essence of all the\npipes he had ever smoked was concentrated into this last one. The smoke\nblew back, and as he sniffed its old homely fragrance he seemed to feel\nthe smell of peat and heather, of drenched homespun in the snowy bogs,\nand the glory of a bright wood fire and the moorland cottage. In a\nsecond his thoughts were many thousand miles away. The night wind\ncooled his brow, and he looked into the dark gap and saw his own past.\n\nThe first picture was a cold place on a low western island. Snow was\ndrifting sparsely, and a dull grey Atlantic swell was grumbling on the\nreefs. He was crouching among the withered rushes, where seaweed and\nshells had been blown, and snow lay in dirty patches. He felt the thick\ncollar of his shooting-coat tight about his neck, while the December\nevening grew darker and colder. A gillie, who had no English, was lying\nat his right hand, and far out at sea a string of squattering geese were\nslowly drifting shorewards with the wind. He saw the scene clear in\nevery line, and he remembered the moment as if it had been yesterday. It\nhad been one of his periods of great exultation. He had just left\nOxford, and had fled northward after some weeks in Paris to wash out the\ntaste of civilization from his mouth among the island north-westers. He\nhad had a great day among the woodcock, and now was finishing with a\nstalk after wild geese. He was furiously hungry, chilled and soaked to\nthe bone, but riotously happy. His future seemed to stretch before him,\na brighter continuation of a bright past, a time for high achievement,\nbold work, and yet no surcease of pleasure. He had been master of\nhimself in that hour, his body firm and strong, his soul clear, his mind\na tempered weapon awaiting his hands.\n\nAnd then the scene changed to a June evening in his own countryside. He\nwas deep in the very heart of the hills beside a little loch, whose\nclear waves lapped on beaches of milky sand, it was just on twilight,\nand an infinite sighing of soft winds was around him, a far-away\nineffable brightness of sunset, and the good scents of dusk among thyme\nand heather. He had fished all the afternoon, and his catch lay on the\nbent beside him. He was to sleep the night in his plaid, and already a\nfire of heather-roots behind him was prepared for supper. He had been\nfor a swim, and his hair was still wet on his forehead. Just across a\nconical hill rose into the golden air, the highest hill in all the\ncountryside, but here but a little thing, for the loch was as high as\nmany a hill-top. Just on its face was a scaur, and there a raven--a\nspeck--was wheeling slowly. Among the little islands broods of mallard\nwere swimming, and trout in a bay were splashing with wide circles. The\nwhole place had seemed caught up into an ecstasy, a riot of gold and\ncrimson and far-off haunting shades and scents and voices. And yet it\nwas no wild spectacle; it was the delicate comfort of it all which had\ncharmed him. Life seemed one glorious holiday, the world a garden of\nthe gods. There was his home across the hills, with its cool chambers,\nits books and pictures, its gardens and memories. There were his\nfriends up and down the earth. There was the earth itself waiting for\nhis conquest. And, meantime, there was this airy land around him, his\nown by the earliest form of occupation.\n\nThe fire died down to embers and a sudden scattering of ashes woke him\nout of his dreaming. The old Scots land was many thousand miles away.\nHis past was wiped out behind him. He was alone in a very strange\nplace, cut off by a great gulf from youth and home and pleasure. For an\ninstant the extreme loneliness of an exile's death smote him, but the\nnext second he comforted himself. The heritage of his land and his\npeople was his in this ultimate moment a hundredfold more than ever.\nThe sounding tale of his people's wars--one against a host, a foray in\nthe mist, a last stand among the mountain snows--sang in his heart like\na tune. The fierce, northern exultation, which glories in hardships and\nthe forlorn, came upon him with such keenness and delight that, as he\nlooked into the night and the black unknown, he felt the joy of a\ngreater kinship. He was kin to men lordlier than himself, the\ntrue-hearted who had ridden the King's path and trampled a little world\nunder foot. To the old fighters in the Border wars, the religionists of\nthe South, the Highland gentlemen of the Cause, he cried greeting over\nthe abyss of time. He had lost no inch of his inheritance. Where,\nindeed, was the true Scotland? Not in the little barren acres he had\nleft, the few thousands of city-folk, or the contentions of unlovely\ncreeds and vain philosophies. The elect of his race had ever been the\nwanderers. No more than Hellas had his land a paltry local unity.\nWherever the English flag was planted anew, wherever men did their duty\nfaithfully and without hope of little reward--there was the fatherland\nof the true patriot.\n\nThe time was passing, and still the world was quiet. The hour must be\nclose on midnight, and still there was no sign of men. For the first\ntime he dared to hope for success. Before, an hour's delay was all that\nhe had sought. To give the north time for a little preparation, to make\ndefence possible, had been his aim; now with the delay he seemed to see\na chance for victory. Bardur would be alarmed hours ago; men would be\non the watch all over Kashmir and the Punjab; the railways would be\nguarded. The invader would find at the least no easy conquest. When\nthey had trodden his life out in the defile they would find stronger men\nto bar their path, and he would not have died in vain. It was a slender\nsatisfaction for vanity, for what share would he have in the defence?\nUnknown, unwept, he would perish utterly, and to others would be the\nglory. He did not care, nay, he rejoiced in the brave obscurity. He\nhad never sought so vulgar a thing as fame. He was going out of life\nlike a snuffed candle. George, if George survived, would know nothing\nof his death. He was miles beyond the frontier, and if George, after\nmonths of war, should make his way to this fatal cleft, what trace would\nhe find of him? And all his friends, Wratislaw, Arthur Mordaunt, the\nfolk of Glenavelin--no word would ever come to them to tell them of his\nend.\n\nBut Alice--and in one wave there returned to him the story which he had\nstriven to put out of his heart. She had known him in his weakness, but\nshe would never think of him in his strength. The whimsical fate\npleased him. The last meeting on that grey autumn afternoon at the\nBroken Bridge had heartened him for his travellings. It had been a\ncompact between them; and now he was redeeming the promise of the tryst.\nAnd she would never know it, would only know that somewhere and somehow\nhe had ceased to struggle with an inborn weakness. Well-a-day! It was\nno world of rounded corners and complete achievements. It was enough if\na hint, a striving, a beginning were found in the scheme of man's\nfrailty. He had no clear-cut conception of a future--that was the happy\nlot of the strong-hearted--but he had a generous intolerance of little\nsuccess. He did not ask rewards, but he prayed for the hope of a good\nbeginning or a gallant failure. The odd romance which lies in the\nwanderer's brain welcomed the paradox. Alice and her bright hair\nfloated dim on the horizon of his vision, something exquisite and dear,\na memory, a voice, a note of tenderness in this last exhilaration. A\nsentimental passion was beyond him; he was too critical of folly to\nworship any lost lady; and he had no love for vain reminiscences. But\nthe girl had become the embodied type of the past. A year ago he had\nnot seen her, now she was home and childhood and friends to him. For a\nmoment there was the old heart-hunger, but the pain had gone. The\nineffectual longing which had galled him had perished at the advent of\nhis new strength.\n\nFor in this ultimate moment he at last seemed to have come to his own.\nThe vulgar little fears, which, like foxes, gnaw at the roots of the\nheart, had gone, even the greater perils of faint hope and a halting\nenergy. The half-hearted had become the stout-hearted. The resistless\nvigour of the strong and the simple was his. He stood in the dark gully\npeering into the night, his muscles stiff from heel to neck. The\nweariness of the day had gone: only the wound in his ear, got the day\nbefore, had begun to bleed afresh. He wiped the blood away with his\nhandkerchief, and laughed at the thought of this little care. In a few\nminutes he would be facing death, and now he was staunching a pin-prick.\n\nHe wondered idly how soon death would come. It would be speedy, at\nleast, and final. And then the glory of the utter loss. His bones\nwhitening among the stones, the suns of summer beating on them and the\nwinter snowdrifts decently covering them with a white sepulchre. No man\ncould seek a lordlier burial. It was the death he had always craved.\nFrom murder, fire, and sudden death, why should we call on the Lord to\ndeliver us? A broken neck in a hunting-field, a slip on rocky\nmountains, a wounded animal at bay--such was the environment of death\nfor which he had ever prayed. But this--this was beyond his dreams.\n\nAnd with it all a great humility fell upon him. His battles were all\nunfought. His life had been careless and gay; and the noble\ncommonplaces of faith and duty had been things of small meaning. He had\nlived within the confines of a little aristocracy of birth and wealth\nand talent, and the great melancholy world scourged by the winds of God\nhad seemed to him but a phrase of rhetoric. His creeds and his\narguments seemed meaningless now in this solemn hour; the truth had been\nhis no more than his crude opponent's! Had he his days to live over\nagain he would look on the world with different eyes. No man any more\nshould call him a dreamer. It pleased him to think that, half-hearted\nand sceptical as he had been, a humorist, a laughing philosopher, he was\nnow dying for one of the catchwords of the crowd. He had returned to\nthe homely paths of the commonplace, and young, unformed, untried, he\nwas caught up by kind fate to the place of the wise and the heroic.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nSuddenly on his thoughts there broke in a dull tread of men, a sound of\nslipping stones and feet upon dry gravel. He broke into the cold sweat\nof tense nerves, and waited, half hidden, with his rifle ready. Then\ncame the light of dull lanterns which showed a thin, endless column\nbeneath the rock walls. They advanced with wonderful quietness, the\nsound of feet broken only by a soft word of command. He calculated the\ndistance--now it was three hundred yards, now two, now a bare eighty.\nAt fifty his rifle flew to his shoulder and he fired. His nerves were\nbad, for one bullet clicked on the rock, while the second took the dust\na yard before the enemy's feet. Instantly there was a halt and the\nsound of speech.\n\nThe failure had steadied him. The second pair of shots killed their\nmen. He heard the quick cry of pain and shivered. He was new to this\nwork and the cry hurt him. But he picked up his express and fired\nagain, and again there was a cry and a fall. Then he heard a word of\ncommand and the sound of men creeping in the side of the nullah. Eye\nand ear were marvelously acute at the moment, for he picked out the\nscouts and killed them. Then he loaded his rifles and waited.\n\nHe saw a man in the half-light not five yards below him. He fired and\nthe man dropped, but he had used his rifle and the great spattering of\nearth showed his whereabouts. Now was the time for keen eye and steady\narm. The enemy had halted thirty yards off and beneath the slope there\nwas a patch of darkness. He kept one eye on this, for it might contain\na man. He fixed his attention on a ray of moonlight which fell across\nthe floor of the gully. When a man crept past this he shot, and he\nrarely failed.\n\nThen a command was given and the column came forward at the double. He\nfired two shots, but the advance continued. They passed the ray of\nlight and he saw the whites of their eyes and the gleam of teeth and\nsteel. They paused a second to fire a volley, and a storm of shot\nrattled about him. He had stepped back into his shelter, and was\nunscathed, but when he looked out he saw the enemy at the foot of the\nslope. His weapons were all loaded except the express, and in mad haste\nhe sent shot after shot into the ranks. The fire halted them, and for a\nsecond they were on the edge of a panic. This unknown destruction\ncoming out of the darkness was terrifying to the stoutest hearts. All\nthe while there was wrath behind them. This stopping of the advance\ncolumn was throwing the whole force into confusion. Angry messages came\nup from the centre, and distracted officers cursed their native guides.\n\nMeanwhile Lewis was something wholly unlike himself, a maddened creature\nwith every sense on the alert, drinking in the glory of the fight. He\nhusbanded the chances of his life with generous parsimony. Every chance\nmeant some minutes' delay and every delay a new link of safety for the\nnorth. His cartridges were getting near an end, but there still\nremained the stones and his pistol and the power of his arm hand to\nhand.\n\nSuddenly came a second volley which all but killed him, bullets glancing\non all sides of him and scraping the rocks with a horrid message of\ndeath. Then on the heels of it came a charge up the slope. The turn\nhad come for the last expedient. He rushed to the stone and with the\nstrength of madness rooted it from its foundations. It wavered for a\nsecond, and then with a cloud of earth and gravel it plunged downwards.\nA second and it had ploughed its way with a sickening grinding sound\ninto the ranks of the men below. There was one wild scream of terror,\nand then a retreat, a flight, almost a panic.\n\nDown in the hollow was a babel of sound, men yelping with fright,\nofficers calming and cursing them, and the shouting of the forces\nbehind. For Lewis the last moment was approaching. The neck of the\npass was now bare and wide and half of the slope was gone. He had lost\nhis weapons in the fall, all but his express, and the loosening of the\nstone had crushed his foot so that he could scarcely stand. Then order\nseemed to be restored, for another volley rang out, which passed over\nhis head as he crouched on the ground. The enemy were advancing slowly,\nresolutely. He knew that now there was something different in their\ntread.\n\nHe was calm and quiet. The mad exhilaration was ebbing and he was\ncalculating chances as dispassionately as a scientist in his study. Two\nshots, the six chambers of his pistol, and then he would be ground to\npowder. The moon rode over the top of the cleft and a sudden wave of\nlight fell on the slope, the writhing dead, and below, the advancing\ncolumn. It gave him a chance for fair shooting, and he did not miss.\nBut the men were maddened with anger and taunts, and they would have\ncharged a battery. They came up on the slope with a fierce rush,\ncursing in gutturals. He slipped behind the old friendly jag of rock\nand waited till they were abreast. Then began a strange pistol\npractice. Crouching in the darkness he selected his men and shot them,\nmaking no mistake. The front ranks of the column turned to the right\nand lunged with their bayonets into the gloom. But the man knew his\npurpose. He climbed farther back till he was above their heads, looking\ndown on ranks of white inhuman faces mad with slaughter and the courage\nwhich is next door to fear. They were still advancing, but with an\nuncertain air. He saw his chance and took it. Crying out he knew not\nwhat, he leapt among them with clutched rifle, striking madly to right\nand left. There was a roar of fright, and for a moment a space was\ncleared around him. He fought like a maniac, stumbling with his crushed\nfoot and leaving two men stunned at his feet. But it was only for a\nmoment. A bayonet entered his side and his rifle snapped at the stock.\nHe grappled with the nearest man and pulled him to the ground, for he\ncould stand no longer. Then there came a wild surge around, a dozen\nbayonets pierced him, and in the article of death he was conscious of a\ngreat press which ground him into the earth. The next moment the column\nwas marching over his body.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nDawn came with light and sweet airs to the dark cleft in the hills.\nJust at that moment, when the red east was breaking into spires and\nclouds of colour, and the little morning winds were beginning to flutter\namong the crags, two men were standing in the throat of the pass. The\nground about them was ploughed up as if by a battery, the rock seamed\nand broken, and red stains of blood were on the dry gravel. From the\nnorth, in the direction of the plain, came the confused sound of an army\nin camp. But to the south there was a glimpse through an aperture of\nhill of a far side of mountain, and on it a gleam as of fire.\n\nMarka, clad in the uniform of a captain of Cossacks, looked fiercely at\nhis companion and then at the beacon.\n\n\"Look,\" he said, \"look and listen!\" And sure enough in the morning\nstillness came the sound as of a watchword cried from post to post.\n\n\"That,\" said he, \"is the morning signal of an awakened empire and the\nfinal proof of our failure.\"\n\n\"It was no fault of mine,\" said Fazir Khan sourly. \"I did as I was\ncommanded, and lo! when I come I find an army in confusion and the\nfrontier guarded.\" The chief spoke with composure, but he had in his\nheart an uneasy consciousness that he had had some share in this\nundoing.\n\nMarka looked down at a body which lay wrinkled across the path. It was\ntrodden all but shapeless, the poor face was unrecognizable, the legs\nwere scrawled like a child's letters. Only one hand with a broken gold\nsignet-ring remained to tell of the poor inmate of the clay.\n\nThe Cossack looked down on the dead with a scowling face. \"Curse\nhim--curse him eternally. Who would have guessed that this fool, this\nphrasing fool, would have spoiled our plans? Curse his conscience and\nhis honour, and God pity him for a fool! I must return to my troops,\nfor this is no place to linger in.\" The man saw his work of years\nspoiled in a night, and all by the agency of a single adventurer. He\nsaw his career blighted, his reputation gone. It is not to be wondered\nat if he was bitter.\n\nHe turned to go, and in leaving pushed the dead man over with his foot.\nHe saw the hand and the broken ring.\n\n\"This thing was once a gentleman,\" he said, and he went down the pass.\n\nBut Fazir Khan remained by the body. He remembered his guest of two\ndays before, and he cursed himself for underrating this wandering\nEnglishman. He saw himself in evil case. His chances of spoil and\nglory had departed. He foresaw expeditions of reprisal, and the\nBada-Mawidi hunted like partridges upon the mountains. He had staked his\nall on a desperate chance, and this one man had been his ruin. For a\nmoment the barbarian came out, and in a sudden ferocity he kicked the\ndead.\n\nBut as he looked again he was moved to a juster appreciation.\n\n\"This thing was a man,\" he said.\n\nThen stooping he dipped his finger in blood and touched his forehead.\n\"This man,\" he said, \"was of the race of kings.\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE HALF-HEARTED***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 17047-8.txt or 17047-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/7\/0\/4\/17047\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations. To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":511,"split":"train"}
