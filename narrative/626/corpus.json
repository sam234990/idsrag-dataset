{"ori_id":"94be0f70671c74fb1eb95f92eeb78601828f3fe8","title":"The Custom of the Country","context":"The Custom of the Country\n The Spraggs, a family of midwesterners from the fictional city of Apex who have made money through somewhat shady financial dealings, arrive in New York City at the prompting of their beautiful, ambitious, but socially-naive daughter, Undine. She marries Ralph Marvell, a member of an old New York family that no longer enjoys significant wealth. Before her wedding, Undine encounters an acquaintance from Apex named Elmer Moffatt, a character with \"a genuine disdain for religious piety and social cant\", as the scholar Elaine Showalter observes. Undine begs him not to do anything that will endanger her wedding to Ralph. Elmer agrees.\nAlthough Ralph dotes on Undine, his finances do not permit the extravagant lifestyle Undine desires, and she feels that her in-laws scorn her. When she becomes pregnant, she is disconsolate; and she neglects her son, Paul, after he is born. Alone in Europe, Undine begins an affair with the nouveau riche Peter Van Degen, who is married to Ralph's cousin, Clare. She then divorces Ralph in the hope of marrying Peter, but this does not work out: Peter seems to want nothing more to do with Undine, and Clare will not grant him a divorce anyway. As a divorcee, Undine loses her high position in society, and spends a few years living in North Dakota, New York, and Paris, scheming to scramble up the social ladder again.\nIn Paris, a French count, Raymond de Chelles, falls in love with Undine. They desire to get married, but, as a Catholic, Raymond cannot marry a divorc\u00e9e. To procure enough money to bribe the Pope to annul Undine's previous marriage, Undine blackmails Ralph. Having been awarded custody of their son, but allowing him to live with Ralph (it was inconvenient for her to raise him in Europe), she demands that the boy be sent to her. It is clear that she will let him remain with Ralph only if he sends her a large sum of money. Ralph does not have sufficient funds of his own, so he borrows money from friends and family and invests it in one of Elmer Moffatt's business deals. The deal does not go through in time to meet Undine's deadline, and Moffat also informs Ralph that he had once eloped with Undine and then was divorced from her\u2014the secret she feared that New York society would discover. Shocked, and also distraught at the thought of losing his son, Ralph commits suicide. Undine is able to marry Raymond as a widow, though this would not be possible if Raymond knew of her first marriage to Moffat.\nUndine is soon dissatisfied with Raymond, too. The de Chelles are hidebound aristocrats, their wealth tied up in land and art and antiques that they will not consider selling, and Undine cannot adjust to the staid customs of upper-class French society. She also resents having to spend most of her time in the country because her husband cannot pay for expensive stays, entertainment, and shopping trips in Paris. Ultimately, she divorces Raymond in order to remarry Elmer Moffatt, who by now has made a fortune. Now, married to the crass midwestern businessman who was best suited to her in the first place, Undine finally has everything she ever desired. Still, it is clear that she wants even more: in the last paragraph of the novel, she imagines what it would be like to be an ambassador's wife \u2013 a position closed to her owing to her divorces.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Custom of the Country, by Edith\nWharton\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost\nno restrictions whatsoever.

The Spragg\nrooms were known as one of the Looey suites, and the drawing-room walls,\nabove their wainscoting of highly-varnished mahogany, were hung with\nsalmon-pink damask and adorned with oval portraits of Marie Antoinette\nand the Princess de Lamballe. In the centre of the florid carpet a gilt\ntable with a top of Mexican onyx sustained a palm in a gilt basket tied\nwith a pink bow. But for this ornament, and a copy of \"The Hound of the\nBaskervilles\" which lay beside it, the room showed no traces of human\nuse, and Mrs. Spragg herself wore as complete an air of detachment as if\nshe had been a wax figure in a show-window. Her attire was fashionable\nenough to justify such a post, and her pale soft-cheeked face, with\npuffy eye-lids and drooping mouth, suggested a partially-melted wax\nfigure which had run to double-chin.\n\nMrs. Heeny, in comparison, had a reassuring look of solidity and\nreality. The planting of her firm black bulk in its chair, and the\ngrasp of her broad red hands on the gilt arms, bespoke an organized and\nself-reliant activity, accounted for by the fact that Mrs. Heeny was a\n\"society\" manicure and masseuse. Toward Mrs. Spragg and her daughter\nshe filled the double role of manipulator and friend; and it was in the\nlatter capacity that, her day's task ended, she had dropped in for a\nmoment to \"cheer up\" the lonely ladies of the Stentorian.\n\nThe young girl whose \"form\" had won Mrs. Heeny's professional\ncommendation suddenly shifted its lovely lines as she turned back from\nthe window.\n\n\"Here--you can have it after all,\" she said, crumpling the note and\ntossing it with a contemptuous gesture into her mother's lap.\n\n\"Why--isn't it from Mr. Popple?\" Mrs. Spragg exclaimed unguardedly.\n\n\"No--it isn't. What made you think I thought it was?\" snapped her\ndaughter; but the next instant she added, with an outbreak of childish\ndisappointment: \"It's only from Mr. Marvell's sister--at least she says\nshe's his sister.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg, with a puzzled frown, groped for her eye-glass among the\njet fringes of her tightly-girded front.\n\nMrs. Heeny's small blue eyes shot out sparks of curiosity.\n\"Marvell--what Marvell is that?\"\n\nThe girl explained languidly: \"A little fellow--I think Mr. Popple said\nhis name was Ralph\"; while her mother continued: \"Undine met them both\nlast night at that party downstairs. And from something Mr. Popple said\nto her about going to one of the new plays, she thought--\"\n\n\"How on earth do you know what I thought?\" Undine flashed back, her grey\neyes darting warnings at her mother under their straight black brows.\n\n\"Why, you SAID you thought--\" Mrs. Spragg began reproachfully; but\nMrs. Heeny, heedless of their bickerings, was pursuing her own train of\nthought.\n\n\"What Popple? Claud Walsingham Popple--the portrait painter?\"\n\n\"Yes--I suppose so. He said he'd like to paint me. Mabel Lipscomb\nintroduced him. I don't care if I never see him again,\" the girl said,\nbathed in angry pink.\n\n\"Do you know him, Mrs. Heeny?\" Mrs. Spragg enquired.\n\n\"I should say I did. I manicured him for his first society portrait--a\nfull-length of Mrs. Harmon B. Driscoll.\" Mrs. Heeny smiled indulgently\non her hearers. \"I know everybody. If they don't know ME they ain't in\nit, and Claud Walsingham Popple's in it. But he ain't nearly AS in it,\"\nshe continued judicially, \"as Ralph Marvell--the little fellow, as you\ncall him.\"\n\nUndine Spragg, at the word, swept round on the speaker with one of\nthe quick turns that revealed her youthful flexibility. She was always\ndoubling and twisting on herself, and every movement she made seemed\nto start at the nape of her neck, just below the lifted roll of\nreddish-gold hair, and flow without a break through her whole slim\nlength to the tips of her fingers and the points of her slender restless\nfeet.\n\n\"Why, do you know the Marvells? Are THEY stylish?\" she asked.\n\nMrs. Heeny gave the discouraged gesture of a pedagogue who has vainly\nstriven to implant the rudiments of knowledge in a rebellious mind.\n\n\"Why, Undine Spragg, I've told you all about them time and again!\nHis mother was a Dagonet. They live with old Urban Dagonet down in\nWashington Square.\"\n\nTo Mrs. Spragg this conveyed even less than to her daughter, \"'way down\nthere? Why do they live with somebody else? Haven't they got the means\nto have a home of their own?\"\n\nUndine's perceptions were more rapid, and she fixed her eyes searchingly\non Mrs. Heeny.\n\n\"Do you mean to say Mr. Marvell's as swell as Mr. Popple?\"\n\n\"As swell? Why, Claud Walsingham Popple ain't in the same class with\nhim!\"\n\nThe girl was upon her mother with a spring, snatching and smoothing out\nthe crumpled note.\n\n\"Laura Fairford--is that the sister's name?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Henley Fairford; yes. What does she write about?\"\n\nUndine's face lit up as if a shaft of sunset had struck it through the\ntriple-curtained windows of the Stentorian.\n\n\"She says she wants me to dine with her next Wednesday. Isn't it queer?\nWhy does SHE want me? She's never seen me!\" Her tone implied that she\nhad long been accustomed to being \"wanted\" by those who had.\n\nMrs. Heeny laughed. \"HE saw you, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Who? Ralph Marvell? Why, of course he did--Mr. Popple brought him to\nthe party here last night.\"\n\n\"Well, there you are... When a young man in society wants to meet a girl\nagain, he gets his sister to ask her.\"\n\nUndine stared at her incredulously. \"How queer! But they haven't all\ngot sisters, have they? It must be fearfully poky for the ones that\nhaven't.\"\n\n\"They get their mothers--or their married friends,\" said Mrs. Heeny\nomnisciently.\n\n\"Married gentlemen?\" enquired Mrs. Spragg, slightly shocked, but\ngenuinely desirous of mastering her lesson.\n\n\"Mercy, no! Married ladies.\"\n\n\"But are there never any gentlemen present?\" pursued Mrs. Spragg,\nfeeling that if this were the case Undine would certainly be\ndisappointed.\n\n\"Present where? At their dinners? Of course--Mrs. Fairford gives the\nsmartest little dinners in town. There was an account of one she gave\nlast week in this morning's TOWN TALK: I guess it's right here among my\nclippings.\" Mrs. Heeny, swooping down on her bag, drew from it a handful\nof newspaper cuttings, which she spread on her ample lap and proceeded\nto sort with a moistened forefinger. \"Here,\" she said, holding one of\nthe slips at arm's length; and throwing back her head she read, in a\nslow unpunctuated chant: '\"Mrs. Henley Fairford gave another of her\nnatty little dinners last Wednesday as usual it was smart small and\nexclusive and there was much gnashing of teeth among the left-outs\nas Madame Olga Loukowska gave some of her new steppe dances after\ndinner'--that's the French for new dance steps,\" Mrs. Heeny concluded,\nthrusting the documents back into her bag.\n\n\"Do you know Mrs. Fairford too?\" Undine asked eagerly; while Mrs.\nSpragg, impressed, but anxious for facts, pursued: \"Does she reside on\nFifth Avenue?\"\n\n\"No, she has a little house in Thirty-eighth Street, down beyond Park\nAvenue.\"\n\nThe ladies' faces drooped again, and the masseuse went on promptly: \"But\nthey're glad enough to have her in the big houses!--Why, yes, I know\nher,\" she said, addressing herself to Undine. \"I mass'd her for a\nsprained ankle a couple of years ago. She's got a lovely manner, but\nNO conversation. Some of my patients converse exquisitely,\" Mrs. Heeny\nadded with discrimination.\n\nUndine was brooding over the note. \"It IS written to mother--Mrs. Abner\nE. Spragg--I never saw anything so funny! 'Will you ALLOW your daughter\nto dine with me?' Allow! Is Mrs. Fairford peculiar?\"\n\n\"No--you are,\" said Mrs. Heeny bluntly. \"Don't you know it's the thing\nin the best society to pretend that girls can't do anything without\ntheir mothers' permission? You just remember that. Undine. You mustn't\naccept invitations from gentlemen without you say you've got to ask your\nmother first.\"\n\n\"Mercy! But how'll mother know what to say?\"\n\n\"Why, she'll say what you tell her to, of course. You'd better tell her\nyou want to dine with Mrs. Fairford,\" Mrs. Heeny added humorously, as\nshe gathered her waterproof together and stooped for her bag.\n\n\"Have I got to write the note, then?\" Mrs. Spragg asked with rising\nagitation.\n\nMrs. Heeny reflected. \"Why, no. I guess Undine can write it as if it was\nfrom you. Mrs. Fairford don't know your writing.\"\n\nThis was an evident relief to Mrs. Spragg, and as Undine swept to her\nroom with the note her mother sank back, murmuring plaintively: \"Oh,\ndon't go yet, Mrs. Heeny. I haven't seen a human being all day, and I\ncan't seem to find anything to say to that French maid.\"\n\nMrs. Heeny looked at her hostess with friendly compassion. She was well\naware that she was the only bright spot on Mrs. Spragg's horizon. Since\nthe Spraggs, some two years previously, had moved from Apex City to New\nYork, they had made little progress in establishing relations with their\nnew environment; and when, about four months earlier, Mrs. Spragg's\ndoctor had called in Mrs. Heeny to minister professionally to his\npatient, he had done more for her spirit than for her body. Mrs. Heeny\nhad had such \"cases\" before: she knew the rich helpless family, stranded\nin lonely splendour in a sumptuous West Side hotel, with a father\ncompelled to seek a semblance of social life at the hotel bar, and\na mother deprived of even this contact with her kind, and reduced to\nillness by boredom and inactivity. Poor Mrs. Spragg had done her own\nwashing in her youth, but since her rising fortunes had made this\noccupation unsuitable she had sunk into the relative inertia which the\nladies of Apex City regarded as one of the prerogatives of affluence. At\nApex, however, she had belonged to a social club, and, until they moved\nto the Mealey House, had been kept busy by the incessant struggle with\ndomestic cares; whereas New York seemed to offer no field for any form\nof lady-like activity. She therefore took her exercise vicariously, with\nMrs. Heeny's help; and Mrs. Heeny knew how to manipulate her imagination\nas well as her muscles. It was Mrs. Heeny who peopled the solitude\nof the long ghostly days with lively anecdotes of the Van Degens, the\nDriscolls, the Chauncey Ellings and the other social potentates whose\nleast doings Mrs. Spragg and Undine had followed from afar in the Apex\npapers, and who had come to seem so much more remote since only the\nwidth of the Central Park divided mother and daughter from their\nOlympian portals.\n\nMrs. Spragg had no ambition for herself--she seemed to have transferred\nher whole personality to her child--but she was passionately resolved\nthat Undine should have what she wanted, and she sometimes fancied that\nMrs. Heeny, who crossed those sacred thresholds so familiarly, might\nsome day gain admission for Undine.\n\n\"Well--I'll stay a little mite longer if you want; and supposing I was\nto rub up your nails while we're talking? It'll be more sociable,\" the\nmasseuse suggested, lifting her bag to the table and covering its shiny\nonyx surface with bottles and polishers.\n\nMrs. Spragg consentingly slipped the rings from her small mottled hands.\nIt was soothing to feel herself in Mrs. Heeny's grasp, and though she\nknew the attention would cost her three dollars she was secure in the\nsense that Abner wouldn't mind. It had been clear to Mrs. Spragg, ever\nsince their rather precipitate departure from Apex City, that Abner was\nresolved not to mind--resolved at any cost to \"see through\" the New York\nadventure. It seemed likely now that the cost would be considerable.\nThey had lived in New York for two years without any social benefit\nto their daughter; and it was of course for that purpose that they had\ncome. If, at the time, there had been other and more pressing reasons,\nthey were such as Mrs. Spragg and her husband never touched on, even in\nthe gilded privacy of their bedroom at the Stentorian; and so completely\nhad silence closed in on the subject that to Mrs. Spragg it had become\nnon-existent: she really believed that, as Abner put it, they had left\nApex because Undine was too big for the place.\n\nShe seemed as yet--poor child!--too small for New York: actually\nimperceptible to its heedless multitudes; and her mother trembled for\nthe day when her invisibility should be borne in on her. Mrs. Spragg\ndid not mind the long delay for herself--she had stores of lymphatic\npatience. But she had noticed lately that Undine was beginning to be\nnervous, and there was nothing that Undine's parents dreaded so much as\nher being nervous. Mrs. Spragg's maternal apprehensions unconsciously\nescaped in her next words.\n\n\"I do hope she'll quiet down now,\" she murmured, feeling quieter herself\nas her hand sank into Mrs. Heeny's roomy palm.\n\n\"Who's that? Undine?\"\n\n\"Yes. She seemed so set on that Mr. Popple's coming round. From the way\nhe acted last night she thought he'd be sure to come round this morning.\nShe's so lonesome, poor child--I can't say as I blame her.\"\n\n\"Oh, he'll come round. Things don't happen as quick as that in New\nYork,\" said Mrs. Heeny, driving her nail-polisher cheeringly.\n\nMrs. Spragg sighed again. \"They don't appear to. They say New Yorkers\nare always in a hurry; but I can't say as they've hurried much to make\nour acquaintance.\"\n\nMrs. Heeny drew back to study the effect of her work. \"You wait, Mrs.\nSpragg, you wait. If you go too fast you sometimes have to rip out the\nwhole seam.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's so--that's SO!\" Mrs. Spragg exclaimed, with a tragic\nemphasis that made the masseuse glance up at her.\n\n\"Of course it's so. And it's more so in New York than anywhere. The\nwrong set's like fly-paper: once you're in it you can pull and pull, but\nyou'll never get out of it again.\"\n\nUndine's mother heaved another and more helpless sigh. \"I wish YOU'D\ntell Undine that, Mrs. Heeny.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess Undine's all right. A girl like her can afford to wait.\nAnd if young Marvell's really taken with her she'll have the run of the\nplace in no time.\"\n\nThis solacing thought enabled Mrs. Spragg to yield herself unreservedly\nto Mrs. Heeny's ministrations, which were prolonged for a happy\nconfidential hour; and she had just bidden the masseuse good-bye, and\nwas restoring the rings to her fingers, when the door opened to admit\nher husband.\n\nMr. Spragg came in silently, setting his high hat down on the\ncentre-table, and laying his overcoat across one of the gilt chairs. He\nwas tallish, grey-bearded and somewhat stooping, with the slack figure\nof the sedentary man who would be stout if he were not dyspeptic; and\nhis cautious grey eyes with pouch-like underlids had straight black\nbrows like his daughter's. His thin hair was worn a little too long over\nhis coat collar, and a Masonic emblem dangled from the heavy gold chain\nwhich crossed his crumpled black waistcoat.\n\nHe stood still in the middle of the room, casting a slow pioneering\nglance about its gilded void; then he said gently: \"Well, mother?\"\n\nMrs. Spragg remained seated, but her eyes dwelt on him affectionately.\n\"Undine's been asked out to a dinner-party; and Mrs. Heeny says it's to\none of the first families. It's the sister of one of the gentlemen that\nMabel Lipscomb introduced her to last night.\"\n\nThere was a mild triumph in her tone, for it was owing to her insistence\nand Undine's that Mr. Spragg had been induced to give up the house\nthey had bought in West End Avenue, and move with his family to the\nStentorian. Undine had early decided that they could not hope to get\non while they \"kept house\"--all the fashionable people she knew either\nboarded or lived in hotels. Mrs. Spragg was easily induced to take\nthe same view, but Mr. Spragg had resisted, being at the moment unable\neither to sell his house or to let it as advantageously as he had hoped.\nAfter the move was made it seemed for a time as though he had been\nright, and the first social steps would be as difficult to make in a\nhotel as in one's own house; and Mrs. Spragg was therefore eager to have\nhim know that Undine really owed her first invitation to a meeting under\nthe roof of the Stentorian.\n\n\"You see we were right to come here, Abner,\" she added, and he absently\nrejoined: \"I guess you two always manage to be right.\"\n\nBut his face remained unsmiling, and instead of seating himself and\nlighting his cigar, as he usually did before dinner, he took two or\nthree aimless turns about the room, and then paused in front of his\nwife.\n\n\"What's the matter--anything wrong down town?\" she asked, her eyes\nreflecting his anxiety.\n\nMrs. Spragg's knowledge of what went on \"down town\" was of the most\nelementary kind, but her husband's face was the barometer in which she\nhad long been accustomed to read the leave to go on unrestrictedly,\nor the warning to pause and abstain till the coming storm should be\nweathered.\n\nHe shook his head. \"N--no. Nothing worse than what I can see to, if you\nand Undine will go steady for a while.\" He paused and looked across the\nroom at his daughter's door. \"Where is she--out?\"\n\n\"I guess she's in her room, going over her dresses with that French\nmaid. I don't know as she's got anything fit to wear to that dinner,\"\nMrs. Spragg added in a tentative murmur.\n\nMr. Spragg smiled at last. \"Well--I guess she WILL have,\" he said\nprophetically.\n\nHe glanced again at his daughter's door, as if to make sure of its being\nshut; then, standing close before his wife, he lowered his voice to say:\n\"I saw Elmer Moffatt down town to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, Abner!\" A wave of almost physical apprehension passed over Mrs.\nSpragg. Her jewelled hands trembled in her black brocade lap, and the\npulpy curves of her face collapsed as if it were a pricked balloon.\n\n\"Oh, Abner,\" she moaned again, her eyes also on her daughter's door. Mr.\nSpragg's black eyebrows gathered in an angry frown, but it was evident\nthat his anger was not against his wife.\n\n\"What's the good of Oh Abner-ing? Elmer Moffatt's nothing to us--no\nmore'n if we never laid eyes on him.\"\n\n\"No--I know it; but what's he doing here? Did you speak to him?\" she\nfaltered.\n\nHe slipped his thumbs into his waistcoat pockets. \"No--I guess Elmer and\nI are pretty well talked out.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg took up her moan. \"Don't you tell her you saw him, Abner.\"\n\n\"I'll do as you say; but she may meet him herself.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess not--not in this new set she's going with! Don't tell her\nANYHOW.\"\n\nHe turned away, feeling for one of the cigars which he always carried\nloose in his pocket; and his wife, rising, stole after him, and laid her\nhand on his arm.\n\n\"He can't do anything to her, can he?\"\n\n\"Do anything to her?\" He swung about furiously. \"I'd like to see him\ntouch her--that's all!\"\n\n\n\nII\n\nUndine's white and gold bedroom, with sea-green panels and old rose\ncarpet, looked along Seventy-second Street toward the leafless tree-tops\nof the Central Park.\n\nShe went to the window, and drawing back its many layers of lace gazed\neastward down the long brownstone perspective. Beyond the Park lay Fifth\nAvenue--and Fifth Avenue was where she wanted to be!\n\nShe turned back into the room, and going to her writing-table laid Mrs.\nFairford's note before her, and began to study it minutely. She had\nread in the \"Boudoir Chat\" of one of the Sunday papers that the smartest\nwomen were using the new pigeon-blood notepaper with white ink; and\nrather against her mother's advice she had ordered a large supply, with\nher monogram in silver. It was a disappointment, therefore, to find that\nMrs. Fairford wrote on the old-fashioned white sheet, without even a\nmonogram--simply her address and telephone number. It gave Undine rather\na poor opinion of Mrs. Fairford's social standing, and for a moment\nshe thought with considerable satisfaction of answering the note on\nher pigeon-blood paper. Then she remembered Mrs. Heeny's emphatic\ncommendation of Mrs. Fairford, and her pen wavered. What if white paper\nwere really newer than pigeon blood? It might be more stylish, anyhow.\nWell, she didn't care if Mrs. Fairford didn't like red paper--SHE did!\nAnd she wasn't going to truckle to any woman who lived in a small house\ndown beyond Park Avenue...\n\nUndine was fiercely independent and yet passionately imitative. She\nwanted to surprise every one by her dash and originality, but she could\nnot help modelling herself on the last person she met, and the confusion\nof ideals thus produced caused her much perturbation when she had to\nchoose between two courses. She hesitated a moment longer, and then took\nfrom the drawer a plain sheet with the hotel address.\n\nIt was amusing to write the note in her mother's name--she giggled as\nshe formed the phrase \"I shall be happy to permit my daughter to take\ndinner with you\" (\"take dinner\" seemed more elegant than Mrs. Fairford's\n\"dine\")--but when she came to the signature she was met by a new\ndifficulty. Mrs. Fairford had signed herself \"Laura Fairford\"--just as\none school-girl would write to another. But could this be a proper model\nfor Mrs. Spragg? Undine could not tolerate the thought of her mother's\nabasing herself to a denizen of regions beyond Park Avenue, and she\nresolutely formed the signature: \"Sincerely, Mrs. Abner E. Spragg.\"\nThen uncertainty overcame her, and she re-wrote her note and copied Mrs.\nFairford's formula: \"Yours sincerely, Leota B. Spragg.\" But this struck\nher as an odd juxtaposition of formality and freedom, and she made a\nthird attempt: \"Yours with love, Leota B. Spragg.\" This, however,\nseemed excessive, as the ladies had never met; and after several other\nexperiments she finally decided on a compromise, and ended the note:\n\"Yours sincerely, Mrs. Leota B. Spragg.\" That might be conventional.\nUndine reflected, but it was certainly correct. This point settled, she\nflung open her door, calling imperiously down the passage: \"Celeste!\"\nand adding, as the French maid appeared: \"I want to look over all my\ndinner-dresses.\"\n\nConsidering the extent of Miss Spragg's wardrobe her dinner-dresses were\nnot many. She had ordered a number the year before but, vexed at her\nlack of use for them, had tossed them over impatiently to the maid.\nSince then, indeed, she and Mrs. Spragg had succumbed to the abstract\npleasure of buying two or three more, simply because they were too\nexquisite and Undine looked too lovely in them; but she had grown tired\nof these also--tired of seeing them hang unworn in her wardrobe, like so\nmany derisive points of interrogation. And now, as Celeste spread them\nout on the bed, they seemed disgustingly common-place, and as familiar\nas if she had danced them to shreds. Nevertheless, she yielded to the\nmaid's persuasions and tried them on.\n\nThe first and second did not gain by prolonged inspection: they looked\nold-fashioned already. \"It's something about the sleeves,\" Undine\ngrumbled as she threw them aside.\n\nThe third was certainly the prettiest; but then it was the one she\nhad worn at the hotel dance the night before and the impossibility of\nwearing it again within the week was too obvious for discussion. Yet she\nenjoyed looking at herself in it, for it reminded her of her sparkling\npassages with Claud Walsingham Popple, and her quieter but more fruitful\ntalk with his little friend--the young man she had hardly noticed.\n\n\"You can go, Celeste--I'll take off the dress myself,\" she said: and\nwhen Celeste had passed out, laden with discarded finery. Undine bolted\nher door, dragged the tall pier-glass forward and, rummaging in a drawer\nfor fan and gloves, swept to a seat before the mirror with the air of\na lady arriving at an evening party. Celeste, before leaving, had drawn\ndown the blinds and turned on the electric light, and the white and gold\nroom, with its blazing wall-brackets, formed a sufficiently brilliant\nbackground to carry out the illusion. So untempered a glare would have\nbeen destructive to all half-tones and subtleties of modelling; but\nUndine's beauty was as vivid, and almost as crude, as the brightness\nsuffusing it. Her black brows, her reddish-tawny hair and the pure red\nand white of her complexion defied the searching decomposing radiance:\nshe might have been some fabled creature whose home was in a beam of\nlight.\n\nUndine, as a child, had taken but a lukewarm interest in the diversions\nof her playmates. Even in the early days when she had lived with her\nparents in a ragged outskirt of Apex, and hung on the fence with Indiana\nFrusk, the freckled daughter of the plumber \"across the way,\" she had\ncared little for dolls or skipping-ropes, and still less for the riotous\ngames in which the loud Indiana played Atalanta to all the boyhood of\nthe quarter. Already Undine's chief delight was to \"dress up\" in her\nmother's Sunday skirt and \"play lady\" before the wardrobe mirror. The\ntaste had outlasted childhood, and she still practised the same secret\npantomime, gliding in, settling her skirts, swaying her fan, moving\nher lips in soundless talk and laughter; but lately she had shrunk\nfrom everything that reminded her of her baffled social yearnings. Now,\nhowever, she could yield without afterthought to the joy of dramatizing\nher beauty. Within a few days she would be enacting the scene she was\nnow mimicking; and it amused her to see in advance just what impression\nshe would produce on Mrs. Fairford's guests.\n\nFor a while she carried on her chat with an imaginary circle of\nadmirers, twisting this way and that, fanning, fidgeting, twitching at\nher draperies, as she did in real life when people were noticing her.\nHer incessant movements were not the result of shyness: she thought it\nthe correct thing to be animated in society, and noise and restlessness\nwere her only notion of vivacity. She therefore watched herself\napprovingly, admiring the light on her hair, the flash of teeth between\nher smiling lips, the pure shadows of her throat and shoulders as she\npassed from one attitude to another. Only one fact disturbed her: there\nwas a hint of too much fulness in the curves of her neck and in the\nspring of her hips. She was tall enough to carry off a little extra\nweight, but excessive slimness was the fashion, and she shuddered at the\nthought that she might some day deviate from the perpendicular.\n\nPresently she ceased to twist and sparkle at her image, and sinking into\nher chair gave herself up to retrospection. She was vexed, in looking\nback, to think how little notice she had taken of young Marvell, who\nturned out to be so much less negligible than his brilliant friend.\nShe remembered thinking him rather shy, less accustomed to society; and\nthough in his quiet deprecating way he had said one or two droll things\nhe lacked Mr. Popple's masterly manner, his domineering yet caressing\naddress. When Mr. Popple had fixed his black eyes on Undine, and\nmurmured something \"artistic\" about the colour of her hair, she had\nthrilled to the depths of her being. Even now it seemed incredible that\nhe should not turn out to be more distinguished than young Marvell: he\nseemed so much more in the key of the world she read about in the Sunday\npapers--the dazzling auriferous world of the Van Degens, the Driscolls\nand their peers.\n\nShe was roused by the sound in the hall of her mother's last words to\nMrs. Heeny. Undine waited till their adieux were over; then, opening her\ndoor, she seized the astonished masseuse and dragged her into the room.\nMrs. Heeny gazed in admiration at the luminous apparition in whose hold\nshe found herself.\n\n\"Mercy, Undine--you do look stunning! Are you trying on your dress for\nMrs. Fairford's?\"\n\n\"Yes--no--this is only an old thing.\" The girl's eyes glittered under\ntheir black brows. \"Mrs. Heeny, you've got to tell me the truth--ARE\nthey as swell as you said?\"\n\n\"Who? The Fairfords and Marvells? If they ain't swell enough for you.\nUndine Spragg, you'd better go right over to the court of England!\"\n\nUndine straightened herself. \"I want the best. Are they as swell as the\nDriscolls and Van Degens?\"\n\nMrs. Heeny sounded a scornful laugh. \"Look at here, now, you unbelieving\ngirl! As sure as I'm standing here before you, I've seen Mrs. Harmon B.\nDriscoll of Fifth Avenue laying in her pink velvet bed with Honiton lace\nsheets on it, and crying her eyes out because she couldn't get asked\nto one of Mrs. Paul Marvell's musicals. She'd never 'a dreamt of being\nasked to a dinner there! Not all of her money couldn't 'a bought her\nthat--and she knows it!\"\n\nUndine stood for a moment with bright cheeks and parted lips; then she\nflung her soft arms about the masseuse. \"Oh Mrs. Heeny--you're lovely\nto me!\" she breathed, her lips on Mrs. Heeny's rusty veil; while the\nlatter, freeing herself with a good-natured laugh, said as she turned\naway: \"Go steady. Undine, and you'll get anywheres.\"\n\nGO STEADY, UNDINE! Yes, that was the advice she needed. Sometimes, in\nher dark moods, she blamed her parents for not having given it to her.\nShe was so young... and they had told her so little! As she looked back\nshe shuddered at some of her escapes. Even since they had come to New\nYork she had been on the verge of one or two perilous adventures, and\nthere had been a moment during their first winter when she had actually\nengaged herself to the handsome Austrian riding-master who accompanied\nher in the Park. He had carelessly shown her a card-case with a coronet,\nand had confided in her that he had been forced to resign from a crack\ncavalry regiment for fighting a duel about a Countess; and as a result\nof these confidences she had pledged herself to him, and bestowed on him\nher pink pearl ring in exchange for one of twisted silver, which he\nsaid the Countess had given him on her deathbed with the request that\nhe should never take it off till he met a woman more beautiful than\nherself.\n\nSoon afterward, luckily. Undine had run across Mabel Lipscomb, whom\nshe had known at a middle western boarding-school as Mabel Blitch. Miss\nBlitch occupied a position of distinction as the only New York girl at\nthe school, and for a time there had been sharp rivalry for her\nfavour between Undine and Indiana Frusk, whose parents had somehow\ncontrived--for one term--to obtain her admission to the same\nestablishment. In spite of Indiana's unscrupulous methods, and of a\ncertain violent way she had of capturing attention, the victory remained\nwith Undine, whom Mabel pronounced more refined; and the discomfited\nIndiana, denouncing her schoolmates as a \"bunch of mushes,\" had\ndisappeared forever from the scene of her defeat.\n\nSince then Mabel had returned to New York and married a stock-broker;\nand Undine's first steps in social enlightenment dated from the day when\nshe had met Mrs. Harry Lipscomb, and been again taken under her wing.\n\nHarry Lipscomb had insisted on investigating the riding-master's record,\nand had found that his real name was Aaronson, and that he had left\nCracow under a charge of swindling servant-girls out of their savings;\nin the light of which discoveries Undine noticed for the first time that\nhis lips were too red and that his hair was pommaded. That was one of\nthe episodes that sickened her as she looked back, and made her resolve\nonce more to trust less to her impulses--especially in the matter of\ngiving away rings. In the interval, however, she felt she had learned a\ngood deal, especially since, by Mabel Lipscomb's advice, the Spraggs had\nmoved to the Stentorian, where that lady was herself established.\n\nThere was nothing of the monopolist about Mabel, and she lost no time in\nmaking Undine free of the Stentorian group and its affiliated branches:\na society addicted to \"days,\" and linked together by membership in\ncountless clubs, mundane, cultural or \"earnest.\" Mabel took Undine to\nthe days, and introduced her as a \"guest\" to the club-meetings, where\nshe was supported by the presence of many other guests--\"my friend Miss\nStager, of Phalanx, Georgia,\" or (if the lady were literary) simply \"my\nfriend Ora Prance Chettle of Nebraska--you know what Mrs. Chettle stands\nfor.\"\n\nSome of these reunions took place in the lofty hotels moored like a\nsonorously named fleet of battle-ships along the upper reaches of the\nWest Side: the Olympian, the Incandescent, the Ormolu; while others,\nperhaps the more exclusive, were held in the equally lofty but more\nromantically styled apartment-houses: the Parthenon, the Tintern Abbey\nor the Lido.\n\nUndine's preference was for the worldly parties, at which games were\nplayed, and she returned home laden with prizes in Dutch silver; but\nshe was duly impressed by the debating clubs, where ladies of local\ndistinction addressed the company from an improvised platform, or the\nmembers argued on subjects of such imperishable interest as: \"What is\ncharm?\" or \"The Problem-Novel\" after which pink lemonade and rainbow\nsandwiches were consumed amid heated discussion of the \"ethical aspect\"\nof the question.\n\nIt was all very novel and interesting, and at first Undine envied Mabel\nLipscomb for having made herself a place in such circles; but in time\nshe began to despise her for being content to remain there. For it did\nnot take Undine long to learn that introduction to Mabel's \"set\" had\nbrought her no nearer to Fifth Avenue. Even in Apex, Undine's tender\nimagination had been nurtured on the feats and gestures of Fifth\nAvenue. She knew all of New York's golden aristocracy by name, and the\nlineaments of its most distinguished scions had been made familiar by\npassionate poring over the daily press. In Mabel's world she sought\nin vain for the originals, and only now and then caught a tantalizing\nglimpse of one of their familiars: as when Claud Walsingham Popple,\nengaged on the portrait of a lady whom the Lipscombs described as \"the\nwife of a Steel Magnet,\" felt it his duty to attend one of his client's\nteas, where it became Mabel's privilege to make his acquaintance and to\nname to him her friend Miss Spragg.\n\nUnsuspected social gradations were thus revealed to the attentive\nUndine, but she was beginning to think that her sad proficiency had been\nacquired in vain when her hopes were revived by the appearance of Mr.\nPopple and his friend at the Stentorian dance. She thought she had\nlearned enough to be safe from any risk of repeating the hideous\nAaronson mistake; yet she now saw she had blundered again in\ndistinguishing Claud Walsingham Popple while she almost snubbed his more\nretiring companion. It was all very puzzling, and her perplexity had\nbeen farther increased by Mrs. Heeny's tale of the great Mrs. Harmon B.\nDriscoll's despair.\n\nHitherto Undine had imagined that the Driscoll and Van Degen clans and\ntheir allies held undisputed suzerainty over New York society. Mabel\nLipscomb thought so too, and was given to bragging of her acquaintance\nwith a Mrs. Spoff, who was merely a second cousin of Mrs. Harmon\nB. Driscoll's. Yet here was she. Undine Spragg of Apex, about to be\nintroduced into an inner circle to which Driscolls and Van Degens had\nlaid siege in vain! It was enough to make her feel a little dizzy with\nher triumph--to work her up into that state of perilous self-confidence\nin which all her worst follies had been committed.\n\nShe stood up and, going close to the glass, examined the reflection\nof her bright eyes and glowing cheeks. This time her fears were\nsuperfluous: there were to be no more mistakes and no more follies now!\nShe was going to know the right people at last--she was going to get\nwhat she wanted!\n\nAs she stood there, smiling at her happy image, she heard her father's\nvoice in the room beyond, and instantly began to tear off her dress,\nstrip the long gloves from her arms and unpin the rose in her hair.\nTossing the fallen finery aside, she slipped on a dressing-gown and\nopened the door into the drawing-room.\n\nMr. Spragg was standing near her mother, who sat in a drooping attitude,\nher head sunk on her breast, as she did when she had one of her \"turns.\"\nHe looked up abruptly as Undine entered.\n\n\"Father--has mother told you? Mrs. Fairford has asked me to dine. She's\nMrs. Paul Marvell's daughter--Mrs. Marvell was a Dagonet--and they're\nsweller than anybody; they WON'T KNOW the Driscolls and Van Degens!\"\n\nMr. Spragg surveyed her with humorous fondness.\n\n\"That so? What do they want to know you for, I wonder?\" he jeered.\n\n\"Can't imagine--unless they think I'll introduce YOU!\" she jeered back\nin the same key, her arms around his stooping shoulders, her shining\nhair against his cheek.\n\n\"Well--and are you going to? Have you accepted?\" he took up her joke as\nshe held him pinioned; while Mrs. Spragg, behind them, stirred in her\nseat with a little moan.\n\nUndine threw back her head, plunging her eyes in his, and pressing so\nclose that to his tired elderly sight her face was a mere bright blur.\n\n\"I want to awfully,\" she declared, \"but I haven't got a single thing to\nwear.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg, at this, moaned more audibly. \"Undine, I wouldn't ask\nfather to buy any more clothes right on top of those last bills.\"\n\n\"I ain't on top of those last bills yet--I'm way down under them,\" Mr.\nSpragg interrupted, raising his hands to imprison his daughter's slender\nwrists.\n\n\"Oh, well--if you want me to look like a scarecrow, and not get asked\nagain, I've got a dress that'll do PERFECTLY,\" Undine threatened, in a\ntone between banter and vexation.\n\nMr. Spragg held her away at arm's length, a smile drawing up the loose\nwrinkles about his eyes.\n\n\"Well, that kind of dress might come in mighty handy on SOME occasions;\nso I guess you'd better hold on to it for future use, and go and select\nanother for this Fairford dinner,\" he said; and before he could finish\nhe was in her arms again, and she was smothering his last word in little\ncries and kisses.\n\n\n\nIII\n\nThough she would not for the world have owned it to her parents, Undine\nwas disappointed in the Fairford dinner.\n\nThe house, to begin with, was small and rather shabby. There was no\ngilding, no lavish diffusion of light: the room they sat in after\ndinner, with its green-shaded lamps making faint pools of brightness,\nand its rows of books from floor to ceiling, reminded Undine of the old\ncirculating library at Apex, before the new marble building was put\nup. Then, instead of a gas-log, or a polished grate with electric bulbs\nbehind ruby glass, there was an old-fashioned wood-fire, like pictures\nof \"Back to the farm for Christmas\"; and when the logs fell forward Mrs.\nPairford or her brother had to jump up to push them in place, and the\nashes scattered over the hearth untidily.\n\nThe dinner too was disappointing. Undine was too young to take note of\nculinary details, but she had expected to view the company through a\nbower of orchids and eat pretty-coloured entrees in ruffled papers.\nInstead, there was only a low centre-dish of ferns, and plain roasted\nand broiled meat that one could recognize--as if they'd been dyspeptics\non a diet! With all the hints in the Sunday papers, she thought it\ndull of Mrs. Fairford not to have picked up something newer; and as the\nevening progressed she began to suspect that it wasn't a real \"dinner\nparty,\" and that they had just asked her in to share what they had when\nthey were alone.\n\nBut a glance about the table convinced her that Mrs. Fairford could not\nhave meant to treat her other guests so lightly. They were only eight\nin number, but one was no less a person than young Mrs. Peter Van\nDegen--the one who had been a Dagonet--and the consideration which this\nyoung lady, herself one of the choicest ornaments of the Society Column,\ndisplayed toward the rest of the company, convinced Undine that they\nmust be more important than they looked. She liked Mrs. Fairford,\na small incisive woman, with a big nose and good teeth revealed by\nfrequent smiles. In her dowdy black and antiquated ornaments she was not\nwhat Undine would have called \"stylish\"; but she had a droll kind way\nwhich reminded the girl of her father's manner when he was not tired or\nworried about money. One of the other ladies, having white hair, did not\nlong arrest Undine's attention; and the fourth, a girl like herself, who\nwas introduced as Miss Harriet Ray, she dismissed at a glance as plain\nand wearing a last year's \"model.\"\n\nThe men, too, were less striking than she had hoped. She had not\nexpected much of Mr. Fairford, since married men were intrinsically\nuninteresting, and his baldness and grey moustache seemed naturally to\nrelegate him to the background; but she had looked for some brilliant\nyouths of her own age--in her inmost heart she had looked for Mr.\nPopple. He was not there, however, and of the other men one, whom\nthey called Mr. Bowen, was hopelessly elderly--she supposed he was the\nhusband of the white-haired lady--and the other two, who seemed to be\nfriends of young Marvell's, were both lacking in Claud Walsingham's\ndash.\n\nUndine sat between Mr. Bowen and young Marvell, who struck her as very\n\"sweet\" (it was her word for friendliness), but even shyer than at the\nhotel dance. Yet she was not sure if he were shy, or if his quietness\nwere only a new kind of self-possession which expressed itself\nnegatively instead of aggressively. Small, well-knit, fair, he sat\nstroking his slight blond moustache and looking at her with kindly,\nalmost tender eyes; but he left it to his sister and the others to draw\nher out and fit her into the pattern.\n\nMrs. Fairford talked so well that the girl wondered why Mrs. Heeny had\nfound her lacking in conversation. But though Undine thought silent\npeople awkward she was not easily impressed by verbal fluency. All the\nladies in Apex City were more voluble than Mrs. Fairford, and had\na larger vocabulary: the difference was that with Mrs. Fairford\nconversation seemed to be a concert and not a solo. She kept drawing in\nthe others, giving each a turn, beating time for them with her smile,\nand somehow harmonizing and linking together what they said. She took\nparticular pains to give Undine her due part in the performance; but\nthe girl's expansive impulses were always balanced by odd reactions\nof mistrust, and to-night the latter prevailed. She meant to watch and\nlisten without letting herself go, and she sat very straight and pink,\nanswering promptly but briefly, with the nervous laugh that punctuated\nall her phrases--saying \"I don't care if I do\" when her host asked her\nto try some grapes, and \"I wouldn't wonder\" when she thought any one was\ntrying to astonish her.\n\nThis state of lucidity enabled her to take note of all that was being\nsaid. The talk ran more on general questions, and less on people, than\nshe was used to; but though the allusions to pictures and books escaped\nher, she caught and stored up every personal reference, and the pink in\nher cheeks deepened at a random mention of Mr. Popple.\n\n\"Yes--he's doing me,\" Mrs. Peter Van Degen was saying, in her slightly\ndrawling voice. \"He's doing everybody this year, you know--\"\n\n\"As if that were a reason!\" Undine heard Mrs. Fairford breathe to Mr.\nBowen; who replied, at the same pitch: \"It's a Van Degen reason, isn't\nit?\"--to which Mrs. Fairford shrugged assentingly.\n\n\"That delightful Popple--he paints so exactly as he talks!\" the\nwhite-haired lady took it up. \"All his portraits seem to proclaim what\na gentleman he is, and how he fascinates women! They're not pictures of\nMrs. or Miss So-and-so, but simply of the impression Popple thinks he's\nmade on them.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford smiled. \"I've sometimes thought,\" she mused, \"that Mr.\nPopple must be the only gentleman I know; at least he's the only man\nwho has ever told me he was a gentleman--and Mr. Popple never fails to\nmention it.\"\n\nUndine's ear was too well attuned to the national note of irony for her\nnot to perceive that her companions were making sport of the painter.\nShe winced at their banter as if it had been at her own expense, yet\nit gave her a dizzy sense of being at last in the very stronghold of\nfashion. Her attention was diverted by hearing Mrs. Van Degen, under\ncover of the general laugh, say in a low tone to young Marvell: \"I\nthought you liked his things, or I wouldn't have had him paint me.\"\n\nSomething in her tone made all Undine's perceptions bristle, and she\nstrained her ears for the answer.\n\n\"I think he'll do you capitally--you must let me come and see some day\nsoon.\" Marvell's tone was always so light, so unemphasized, that she\ncould not be sure of its being as indifferent as it sounded. She looked\ndown at the fruit on her plate and shot a side-glance through her lashes\nat Mrs. Peter Van Degen.\n\nMrs. Van Degen was neither beautiful nor imposing: just a dark\ngirlish-looking creature with plaintive eyes and a fidgety frequent\nlaugh. But she was more elaborately dressed and jewelled than the other\nladies, and her elegance and her restlessness made her seem less\nalien to Undine. She had turned on Marvell a gaze at once pleading and\npossessive; but whether betokening merely an inherited intimacy (Undine\nhad noticed that they were all more or less cousins) or a more personal\nfeeling, her observer was unable to decide; just as the tone of\nthe young man's reply might have expressed the open avowal of\ngood-fellowship or the disguise of a different sentiment. All was\nblurred and puzzling to the girl in this world of half-lights,\nhalf-tones, eliminations and abbreviations; and she felt a violent\nlonging to brush away the cobwebs and assert herself as the dominant\nfigure of the scene.\n\nYet in the drawing-room, with the ladies, where Mrs. Fairford came and\nsat by her, the spirit of caution once more prevailed. She wanted to be\nnoticed but she dreaded to be patronized, and here again her hostess's\ngradations of tone were confusing. Mrs. Fairford made no tactless\nallusions to her being a newcomer in New York--there was nothing as\nbitter to the girl as that--but her questions as to what pictures had\ninterested Undine at the various exhibitions of the moment, and which of\nthe new books she had read, were almost as open to suspicion, since they\nhad to be answered in the negative. Undine did not even know that there\nwere any pictures to be seen, much less that \"people\" went to see them;\nand she had read no new book but \"When The Kissing Had to Stop,\" of\nwhich Mrs. Fairford seemed not to have heard. On the theatre they were\nequally at odds, for while Undine had seen \"Oolaloo\" fourteen times, and\nwas \"wild\" about Ned Norris in \"The Soda-Water Fountain,\" she had not\nheard of the famous Berlin comedians who were performing Shakespeare at\nthe German Theatre, and knew only by name the clever American actress\nwho was trying to give \"repertory\" plays with a good stock company. The\nconversation was revived for a moment by her recalling that she had seen\nSarah Bernhard in a play she called \"Leg-long,\" and another which she\npronounced \"Fade\"; but even this did not carry them far, as she had\nforgotten what both plays were about and had found the actress a good\ndeal older than she expected.\n\nMatters were not improved by the return of the men from the\nsmoking-room. Henley Fairford replaced his wife at Undine's side; and\nsince it was unheard-of at Apex for a married man to force his society\non a young girl, she inferred that the others didn't care to talk to\nher, and that her host and hostess were in league to take her off their\nhands. This discovery resulted in her holding her vivid head very high,\nand answering \"I couldn't really say,\" or \"Is that so?\" to all Mr.\nFairford's ventures; and as these were neither numerous nor striking it\nwas a relief to both when the rising of the elderly lady gave the signal\nfor departure.\n\nIn the hall, where young Marvell had managed to precede her. Undine\nfound Mrs. Van Degen putting on her cloak. As she gathered it about her\nshe laid her hand on Marvell's arm.\n\n\"Ralphie, dear, you'll come to the opera with me on Friday? We'll dine\ntogether first--Peter's got a club dinner.\" They exchanged what seemed a\nsmile of intelligence, and Undine heard the young man accept. Then Mrs.\nVan Degen turned to her.\n\n\"Good-bye, Miss Spragg. I hope you'll come--\"\n\n\"--TO DINE WITH ME TOO?\" That must be what she was going to say, and\nUndine's heart gave a bound.\n\n\"--to see me some afternoon,\" Mrs. Van Degen ended, going down the steps\nto her motor, at the door of which a much-furred footman waited with\nmore furs on his arm.\n\nUndine's face burned as she turned to receive her cloak. When she had\ndrawn it on with haughty deliberation she found Marvell at her side,\nin hat and overcoat, and her heart gave a higher bound. He was going to\n\"escort\" her home, of course! This brilliant youth--she felt now that he\nWAS brilliant--who dined alone with married women, whom the \"Van Degen\nset\" called \"Ralphie, dear,\" had really no eyes for any one but herself;\nand at the thought her lost self-complacency flowed back warm through\nher veins.\n\nThe street was coated with ice, and she had a delicious moment\ndescending the steps on Marvell's arm, and holding it fast while they\nwaited for her cab to come up; but when he had helped her in he closed\nthe door and held his hand out over the lowered window.\n\n\"Good-bye,\" he said, smiling; and she could not help the break of pride\nin her voice, as she faltered out stupidly, from the depths of her\ndisillusionment: \"Oh--good-bye.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\"Father, you've got to take a box for me at the opera next Friday.\"\n\nFrom the tone of her voice Undine's parents knew at once that she was\n\"nervous.\"\n\nThey had counted a great deal on the Fairford dinner as a means of\ntranquillization, and it was a blow to detect signs of the opposite\nresult when, late the next morning, their daughter came dawdling into\nthe sodden splendour of the Stentorian breakfast-room.\n\nThe symptoms of Undine's nervousness were unmistakable to Mr. and Mrs.\nSpragg. They could read the approaching storm in the darkening of her\neyes from limpid grey to slate-colour, and in the way her straight\nblack brows met above them and the red curves of her lips narrowed to a\nparallel line below.\n\nMr. Spragg, having finished the last course of his heterogeneous meal,\nwas adjusting his gold eye-glasses for a glance at the paper when\nUndine trailed down the sumptuous stuffy room, where coffee-fumes hung\nperpetually under the emblazoned ceiling and the spongy carpet might\nhave absorbed a year's crumbs without a sweeping.\n\nAbout them sat other pallid families, richly dressed, and silently\neating their way through a bill-of-fare which seemed to have ransacked\nthe globe for gastronomic incompatibilities; and in the middle of the\nroom a knot of equally pallid waiters, engaged in languid conversation,\nturned their backs by common consent on the persons they were supposed\nto serve.\n\nUndine, who rose too late to share the family breakfast, usually had her\nchocolate brought to her in bed by Celeste, after the manner described\nin the articles on \"A Society Woman's Day\" which were appearing in\nBoudoir Chat. Her mere appearance in the restaurant therefore prepared\nher parents for those symptoms of excessive tension which a nearer\ninspection confirmed, and Mr. Spragg folded his paper and hooked his\nglasses to his waistcoat with the air of a man who prefers to know the\nworst and have it over.\n\n\"An opera box!\" faltered Mrs. Spragg, pushing aside the bananas and\ncream with which she had been trying to tempt an appetite too languid\nfor fried liver or crab mayonnaise.\n\n\"A parterre box,\" Undine corrected, ignoring the exclamation, and\ncontinuing to address herself to her father. \"Friday's the stylish\nnight, and that new tenor's going to sing again in 'Cavaleeria,'\" she\ncondescended to explain.\n\n\"That so?\" Mr. Spragg thrust his hands into his waistcoat pockets, and\nbegan to tilt his chair till he remembered there was no wall to meet it.\nHe regained his balance and said: \"Wouldn't a couple of good orchestra\nseats do you?\"\n\n\"No; they wouldn't,\" Undine answered with a darkening brow. He looked at\nher humorously. \"You invited the whole dinner-party, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No--no one.\"\n\n\"Going all alone in a box?\" She was disdainfully silent. \"I don't s'pose\nyou're thinking of taking mother and me?\"\n\nThis was so obviously comic that they all laughed--even Mrs. Spragg--and\nUndine went on more mildly: \"I want to do something for Mabel Lipscomb:\nmake some return. She's always taking me 'round, and I've never done a\nthing for her--not a single thing.\"\n\nThis appeal to the national belief in the duty of reciprocal \"treating\"\ncould not fail of its effect, and Mrs. Spragg murmured: \"She never HAS,\nAbner,\"--but Mr. Spragg's brow remained unrelenting.\n\n\"Do you know what a box costs?\"\n\n\"No; but I s'pose you do,\" Undine returned with unconscious flippancy.\n\n\"I do. That's the trouble. WHY won't seats do you?\"\n\n\"Mabel could buy seats for herself.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" interpolated Mrs. Spragg--always the first to succumb to\nher daughter's arguments.\n\n\"Well, I guess I can't buy a box for her.\"\n\nUndine's face gloomed more deeply. She sat silent, her chocolate\nthickening in the cup, while one hand, almost as much beringed as her\nmother's, drummed on the crumpled table-cloth.\n\n\"We might as well go straight back to Apex,\" she breathed at last\nbetween her teeth.\n\nMrs. Spragg cast a frightened glance at her husband. These struggles\nbetween two resolute wills always brought on her palpitations, and she\nwished she had her phial of digitalis with her.\n\n\"A parterre box costs a hundred and twenty-five dollars a night,\" said\nMr. Spragg, transferring a toothpick to his waistcoat pocket.\n\n\"I only want it once.\"\n\nHe looked at her with a quizzical puckering of his crows'-feet. \"You\nonly want most things once. Undine.\"\n\nIt was an observation they had made in her earliest youth--Undine never\nwanted anything long, but she wanted it \"right off.\" And until she got\nit the house was uninhabitable.\n\n\"I'd a good deal rather have a box for the season,\" she rejoined, and he\nsaw the opening he had given her. She had two ways of getting things\nout of him against his principles; the tender wheedling way, and the\nharsh-lipped and cold--and he did not know which he dreaded most. As a\nchild they had admired her assertiveness, had made Apex ring with\ntheir boasts of it; but it had long since cowed Mrs. Spragg, and it was\nbeginning to frighten her husband.\n\n\"Fact is, Undie,\" he said, weakening, \"I'm a little mite strapped just\nthis month.\"\n\nHer eyes grew absent-minded, as they always did when he alluded to\nbusiness. THAT was man's province; and what did men go \"down town\" for\nbut to bring back the spoils to their women? She rose abruptly, leaving\nher parents seated, and said, more to herself than the others: \"Think\nI'll go for a ride.\"\n\n\"Oh, Undine!\" fluttered Mrs. Spragg. She always had palpitations when\nUndine rode, and since the Aaronson episode her fears were not confined\nto what the horse might do.\n\n\"Why don't you take your mother out shopping a little?\" Mr. Spragg\nsuggested, conscious of the limitation of his resources.\n\nUndine made no answer, but swept down the room, and out of the door\nahead of her mother, with scorn and anger in every line of her arrogant\nyoung back. Mrs. Spragg tottered meekly after her, and Mr. Spragg\nlounged out into the marble hall to buy a cigar before taking the Subway\nto his office.\n\nUndine went for a ride, not because she felt particularly disposed for\nthe exercise, but because she wished to discipline her mother. She was\nalmost sure she would get her opera box, but she did not see why she\nshould have to struggle for her rights, and she was especially annoyed\nwith Mrs. Spragg for seconding her so half-heartedly. If she and her\nmother did not hold together in such crises she would have twice the\nwork to do.\n\nUndine hated \"scenes\": she was essentially peace-loving, and would have\npreferred to live on terms of unbroken harmony with her parents. But\nshe could not help it if they were unreasonable. Ever since she could\nremember there had been \"fusses\" about money; yet she and her mother had\nalways got what they wanted, apparently without lasting detriment to the\nfamily fortunes. It was therefore natural to conclude that there were\nample funds to draw upon, and that Mr. Spragg's occasional resistances\nwere merely due to an imperfect understanding of what constituted the\nnecessities of life.\n\nWhen she returned from her ride Mrs. Spragg received her as if she had\ncome back from the dead. It was absurd, of course; but Undine was inured\nto the absurdity of parents.\n\n\"Has father telephoned?\" was her first brief question.\n\n\"No, he hasn't yet.\"\n\nUndine's lips tightened, but she proceeded deliberately with the removal\nof her habit.\n\n\"You'd think I'd asked him to buy me the Opera House, the way\nhe's acting over a single box,\" she muttered, flinging aside her\nsmartly-fitting coat. Mrs. Spragg received the flying garment and\nsmoothed it out on the bed. Neither of the ladies could \"bear\" to have\ntheir maid about when they were at their toilet, and Mrs. Spragg had\nalways performed these ancillary services for Undine.\n\n\"You know, Undie, father hasn't always got the money in his pocket, and\nthe bills have been pretty heavy lately. Father was a rich man for Apex,\nbut that's different from being rich in New York.\"\n\nShe stood before her daughter, looking down on her appealingly.\n\nUndine, who had seated herself while she detached her stock and\nwaistcoat, raised her head with an impatient jerk. \"Why on earth did we\never leave Apex, then?\" she exclaimed.\n\nMrs. Spragg's eyes usually dropped before her daughter's inclement\ngaze; but on this occasion they held their own with a kind of awe-struck\ncourage, till Undine's lids sank above her flushing cheeks.\n\nShe sprang up, tugging at the waistband of her habit, while Mrs. Spragg,\nrelapsing from temerity to meekness, hovered about her with obstructive\nzeal. \"If you'd only just let go of my skirt, mother--I can unhook it\ntwice as quick myself.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg drew back, understanding that her presence was no longer\nwanted. But on the threshold she paused, as if overruled by a stronger\ninfluence, and said, with a last look at her daughter: \"You didn't meet\nanybody when you were out, did you, Undie?\"\n\nUndine's brows drew together: she was struggling with her long\npatent-leather boot.\n\n\"Meet anybody? Do you mean anybody I know? I don't KNOW anybody--I never\nshall, if father can't afford to let me go round with people!\"\n\nThe boot was off with a wrench, and she flung it violently across the\nold-rose carpet, while Mrs. Spragg, turning away to hide a look of\ninexpressible relief, slipped discreetly from the room.\n\nThe day wore on. Undine had meant to go down and tell Mabel Lipscomb\nabout the Fairford dinner, but its aftertaste was flat on her lips. What\nwould it lead to? Nothing, as far as she could see. Ralph Marvell had\nnot even asked when he might call; and she was ashamed to confess to\nMabel that he had not driven home with her.\n\nSuddenly she decided that she would go and see the pictures of which\nMrs. Fairford had spoken. Perhaps she might meet some of the people she\nhad seen at dinner--from their talk one might have imagined that they\nspent their lives in picture-galleries.\n\nThe thought reanimated her, and she put on her handsomest furs, and a\nhat for which she had not yet dared present the bill to her father. It\nwas the fashionable hour in Fifth Avenue, but Undine knew none of the\nladies who were bowing to each other from interlocked motors. She had to\ncontent herself with the gaze of admiration which she left in her wake\nalong the pavement; but she was used to the homage of the streets and\nher vanity craved a choicer fare.\n\nWhen she reached the art gallery which Mrs. Fairford had named she\nfound it even more crowded than Fifth Avenue; and some of the ladies\nand gentlemen wedged before the pictures had the \"look\" which signified\nsocial consecration. As Undine made her way among them, she was aware of\nattracting almost as much notice as in the street, and she flung\nherself into rapt attitudes before the canvases, scribbling notes in\nthe catalogue in imitation of a tall girl in sables, while ripples of\nself-consciousness played up and down her watchful back.\n\nPresently her attention was drawn to a lady in black who was examining\nthe pictures through a tortoise-shell eye-glass adorned with diamonds\nand hanging from a long pearl chain. Undine was instantly struck by the\nopportunities which this toy presented for graceful wrist movements\nand supercilious turns of the head. It seemed suddenly plebeian and\npromiscuous to look at the world with a naked eye, and all her floating\ndesires were merged in the wish for a jewelled eye-glass and chain. So\nviolent was this wish that, drawn on in the wake of the owner of the\neye-glass, she found herself inadvertently bumping against a stout\ntight-coated young man whose impact knocked her catalogue from her hand.\n\nAs the young man picked the catalogue up and held it out to her she\nnoticed that his bulging eyes and queer retreating face were suffused\nwith a glow of admiration. He was so unpleasant-looking that she would\nhave resented his homage had not his odd physiognomy called up some\nvaguely agreeable association of ideas. Where had she seen before this\ngrotesque saurian head, with eye-lids as thick as lips and lips as\nthick as ear-lobes? It fled before her down a perspective of innumerable\nnewspaper portraits, all, like the original before her, tightly coated,\nwith a huge pearl transfixing a silken tie....\n\n\"Oh, thank you,\" she murmured, all gleams and graces, while he stood hat\nin hand, saying sociably:\n\n\"The crowd's simply awful, isn't it?\"\n\nAt the same moment the lady of the eye-glass drifted closer, and with a\ntap of her wand, and a careless \"Peter, look at this,\" swept him to the\nother side of the gallery.\n\nUndine's heart was beating excitedly, for as he turned away she had\nidentified him. Peter Van Degen--who could he be but young Peter Van\nDegen, the son of the great banker, Thurber Van Degen, the husband of\nRalph Marvell's cousin, the hero of \"Sunday Supplements,\" the captor of\nBlue Ribbons at Horse-Shows, of Gold Cups at Motor Races, the owner of\nwinning race-horses and \"crack\" sloops: the supreme exponent, in short,\nof those crowning arts that made all life seem stale and unprofitable\noutside the magic ring of the Society Column? Undine smiled as she\nrecalled the look with which his pale protruding eyes had rested on\nher--it almost consoled her for his wife's indifference!\n\nWhen she reached home she found that she could not remember anything\nabout the pictures she had seen...\n\nThere was no message from her father, and a reaction of disgust set in.\nOf what good were such encounters if they were to have no sequel? She\nwould probably never meet Peter Van Degen again--or, if she DID run\nacross him in the same accidental way, she knew they could not continue\ntheir conversation without being \"introduced.\" What was the use of being\nbeautiful and attracting attention if one were perpetually doomed to\nrelapse again into the obscure mass of the Uninvited?\n\nHer gloom was not lightened by finding Ralph Marvell's card on the\ndrawing-room table. She thought it unflattering and almost impolite of\nhim to call without making an appointment: it seemed to show that he\ndid not wish to continue their acquaintance. But as she tossed the card\naside her mother said: \"He was real sorry not to see you. Undine--he sat\nhere nearly an hour.\"\n\nUndine's attention was roused. \"Sat here--all alone? Didn't you tell him\nI was out?\"\n\n\"Yes--but he came up all the same. He asked for me.\"\n\n\"Asked for YOU?\"\n\nThe social order seemed to be falling in ruins at Undine's feet. A\nvisitor who asked for a girl's mother!--she stared at Mrs. Spragg with\ncold incredulity. \"What makes you think he did?\"\n\n\"Why, they told me so. I telephoned down that you were out, and they\nsaid he'd asked for me.\" Mrs. Spragg let the fact speak for itself--it\nwas too much out of the range of her experience to admit of even a\nhypothetical explanation.\n\nUndine shrugged her shoulders. \"It was a mistake, of course. Why on\nearth did you let him come up?\"\n\n\"I thought maybe he had a message for you, Undie.\"\n\nThis plea struck her daughter as not without weight. \"Well, did he?\"\nshe asked, drawing out her hat-pins and tossing down her hat on the onyx\ntable.\n\n\"Why, no--he just conversed. He was lovely to me, but I couldn't make\nout what he was after,\" Mrs. Spragg was obliged to own.\n\nHer daughter looked at her with a kind of chill commiseration. \"You\nnever CAN,\" she murmured, turning away.\n\nShe stretched herself out moodily on one of the pink and gold sofas,\nand lay there brooding, an unread novel on her knee. Mrs. Spragg timidly\nslipped a cushion under her daughter's head, and then dissembled herself\nbehind the lace window-curtains and sat watching the lights spring out\ndown the long street and spread their glittering net across the Park. It\nwas one of Mrs. Spragg's chief occupations to watch the nightly lighting\nof New York.\n\nUndine lay silent, her hands clasped behind her head. She was plunged in\none of the moods of bitter retrospection when all her past seemed like a\nlong struggle for something she could not have, from a trip to Europe to\nan opera-box; and when she felt sure that, as the past had been, so the\nfuture would be. And yet, as she had often told her parents, all she\nsought for was improvement: she honestly wanted the best.\n\nHer first struggle--after she had ceased to scream for candy, or sulk\nfor a new toy--had been to get away from Apex in summer. Her summers,\nas she looked back on them, seemed to typify all that was dreariest and\nmost exasperating in her life. The earliest had been spent in the\nyellow \"frame\" cottage where she had hung on the fence, kicking her\ntoes against the broken palings and exchanging moist chewing-gum and\nhalf-eaten apples with Indiana Frusk. Later on, she had returned from\nher boarding-school to the comparative gentility of summer vacations at\nthe Mealey House, whither her parents, forsaking their squalid suburb,\nhad moved in the first flush of their rising fortunes. The tessellated\nfloors, the plush parlours and organ-like radiators of the Mealey House\nhad, aside from their intrinsic elegance, the immense advantage of\nlifting the Spraggs high above the Frusks, and making it possible for\nUndine, when she met Indiana in the street or at school, to chill her\nadvances by a careless allusion to the splendours of hotel life. But\neven in such a setting, and in spite of the social superiority it\nimplied, the long months of the middle western summer, fly-blown,\ntorrid, exhaling stale odours, soon became as insufferable as they had\nbeen in the little yellow house. At school Undine met other girls whose\nparents took them to the Great Lakes for August; some even went to\nCalifornia, others--oh bliss ineffable!--went \"east.\"\n\nPale and listless under the stifling boredom of the Mealey House\nroutine, Undine secretly sucked lemons, nibbled slate-pencils and drank\npints of bitter coffee to aggravate her look of ill-health; and when she\nlearned that even Indiana Frusk was to go on a month's visit to Buffalo\nit needed no artificial aids to emphasize the ravages of envy. Her\nparents, alarmed by her appearance, were at last convinced of the\nnecessity of change, and timidly, tentatively, they transferred\nthemselves for a month to a staring hotel on a glaring lake.\n\nThere Undine enjoyed the satisfaction of sending ironic post-cards to\nIndiana, and discovering that she could more than hold her own\nagainst the youth and beauty of the other visitors. Then she made the\nacquaintance of a pretty woman from Richmond, whose husband, a mining\nengineer, had brought her west with him while he inspected the\nnewly developed Eubaw mines; and the southern visitor's dismay, her\nrepugnances, her recoil from the faces, the food, the amusements, the\ngeneral bareness and stridency of the scene, were a terrible initiation\nto Undine. There was something still better beyond, then--more\nluxurious, more exciting, more worthy of her! She once said to herself,\nafterward, that it was always her fate to find out just too late about\nthe \"something beyond.\" But in this case it was not too late--and\nobstinately, inflexibly, she set herself to the task of forcing her\nparents to take her \"east\" the next summer.\n\nYielding to the inevitable, they suffered themselves to be impelled to\na Virginia \"resort,\" where Undine had her first glimpse of more romantic\npossibilities--leafy moonlight rides and drives, picnics in mountain\nglades, and an atmosphere of Christmas-chromo sentimentality that\ntempered her hard edges a little, and gave her glimpses of a more\ndelicate kind of pleasure. But here again everything was spoiled by a\npeep through another door. Undine, after a first mustering of the other\ngirls in the hotel, had, as usual, found herself easily first--till the\narrival, from Washington, of Mr. and Mrs. Wincher and their daughter.\nUndine was much handsomer than Miss Wincher, but she saw at a glance\nthat she did not know how to use her beauty as the other used her\nplainness. She was exasperated too, by the discovery that Miss Wincher\nseemed not only unconscious of any possible rivalry between them, but\nactually unaware of her existence. Listless, long-faced, supercilious,\nthe young lady from Washington sat apart reading novels or playing\nsolitaire with her parents, as though the huge hotel's loud life of\ngossip and flirtation were invisible and inaudible to her. Undine never\neven succeeded in catching her eye: she always lowered it to her book\nwhen the Apex beauty trailed or rattled past her secluded corner. But\none day an acquaintance of the Winchers' turned up--a lady from Boston,\nwho had come to Virginia on a botanizing tour; and from scraps of Miss\nWincher's conversation with the newcomer, Undine, straining her ears\nbehind a column of the long veranda, obtained a new glimpse into the\nunimagined.\n\nThe Winchers, it appeared, found themselves at Potash Springs merely\nbecause a severe illness of Mrs. Wincher's had made it impossible, at\nthe last moment, to move her farther from Washington. They had let their\nhouse on the North Shore, and as soon as they could leave \"this dreadful\nhole\" were going to Europe for the autumn. Miss Wincher simply didn't\nknow how she got through the days; though no doubt it was as good as\na rest-cure after the rush of the winter. Of course they would have\npreferred to hire a house, but the \"hole,\" if one could believe it,\ndidn't offer one; so they had simply shut themselves off as best\nthey could from the \"hotel crew\"--had her friend, Miss Wincher\nparenthetically asked, happened to notice the Sunday young men? They\nwere queerer even than the \"belles\" they came for--and had escaped the\npromiscuity of the dinner-hour by turning one of their rooms into a\ndining-room, and picnicking there--with the Persimmon House standards,\none couldn't describe it in any other way! But luckily the awful place\nwas doing mamma good, and now they had nearly served their term...\n\nUndine turned sick as she listened. Only the evening before she had\ngone on a \"buggy-ride\" with a young gentleman from Deposit--a dentist's\nassistant--and had let him kiss her, and given him the flower from her\nhair. She loathed the thought of him now: she loathed all the people\nabout her, and most of all the disdainful Miss Wincher. It enraged her\nto think that the Winchers classed her with the \"hotel crew\"--with\nthe \"belles\" who awaited their Sunday young men. The place was forever\nblighted for her, and the next week she dragged her amazed but thankful\nparents back to Apex.\n\nBut Miss Wincher's depreciatory talk had opened ampler vistas, and the\npioneer blood in Undine would not let her rest. She had heard the call\nof the Atlantic seaboard, and the next summer found the Spraggs at Skog\nHarbour, Maine. Even now Undine felt a shiver of boredom as she recalled\nit. That summer had been the worst of all. The bare wind-beaten inn, all\nshingles without and blueberry pie within, was \"exclusive,\" parochial,\nBostonian; and the Spraggs wore through the interminable weeks in blank\nunmitigated isolation. The incomprehensible part of it was that every\nother woman in the hotel was plain, dowdy or elderly--and most of them\nall three. If there had been any competition on ordinary lines Undine\nwould have won, as Van Degen said, \"hands down.\" But there wasn't--the\nother \"guests\" simply formed a cold impenetrable group who walked,\nboated, played golf, and discussed Christian Science and the Subliminal,\nunaware of the tremulous organism drifting helplessly against their\nrock-bound circle.\n\nIt was on the day the Spraggs left Skog Harbour that Undine vowed to\nherself with set lips: \"I'll never try anything again till I try New\nYork.\" Now she had gained her point and tried New York, and so far, it\nseemed, with no better success. From small things to great, everything\nwent against her. In such hours of self-searching she was ready enough\nto acknowledge her own mistakes, but they exasperated her less than the\nblunders of her parents. She was sure, for instance, that she was on\nwhat Mrs. Heeny called \"the right tack\" at last: yet just at the\nmoment when her luck seemed about to turn she was to be thwarted by her\nfather's stupid obstinacy about the opera-box...\n\nShe lay brooding over these things till long after Mrs. Spragg had gone\naway to dress for dinner, and it was nearly eight o'clock when she heard\nher father's dragging tread in the hall.\n\nShe kept her eyes fixed on her book while he entered the room and moved\nabout behind her, laying aside his hat and overcoat; then his steps came\nclose and a small parcel dropped on the pages of her book.\n\n\"Oh, father!\" She sprang up, all alight, the novel on the floor, her\nfingers twitching for the tickets. But a substantial packet emerged,\nlike nothing she had ever seen. She looked at it, hoping, fearing--she\nbeamed blissful interrogation on her father while his sallow smile\ncontinued to tantalize her. Then she closed on him with a rush,\nsmothering his words against her hair.\n\n\"It's for more than one night--why, it's for every other Friday! Oh, you\ndarling, you darling!\" she exulted.\n\nMr. Spragg, through the glittering meshes, feigned dismay. \"That so?\nThey must have given me the wrong--!\" Then, convicted by her radiant\neyes as she swung round on him: \"I knew you only wanted it ONCE for\nyourself. Undine; but I thought maybe, off nights, you'd like to send it\nto your friends.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg, who from her doorway had assisted with moist eyes at this\nclosing pleasantry, came forward as Undine hurried away to dress.\n\n\"Abner--can you really manage it all right?\"\n\nHe answered her with one of his awkward brief caresses. \"Don't you fret\nabout that, Leota. I'm bound to have her go round with these people she\nknows. I want her to be with them all she can.\"\n\nA pause fell between them, while Mrs. Spragg looked anxiously into his\nfagged eyes.\n\n\"You seen Elmer again?\"\n\n\"No. Once was enough,\" he returned, with a scowl like Undine's.\n\n\"Why--you SAID he couldn't come after her, Abner!\"\n\n\"No more he can. But what if she was to get nervous and lonesome, and\nwant to go after him?\"\n\nMrs. Spragg shuddered away from the suggestion. \"How'd he look? Just the\nsame?\" she whispered.\n\n\"No. Spruced up. That's what scared me.\"\n\nIt scared her too, to the point of blanching her habitually lifeless\ncheek. She continued to scrutinize her husband broodingly. \"You look\nfairly sick, Abner. You better let me get you some of those stomach\ndrops right off,\" she proposed.\n\nBut he parried this with his unfailing humour. \"I guess I'm too sick to\nrisk that.\" He passed his hand through her arm with the conjugal gesture\nfamiliar to Apex City. \"Come along down to dinner, mother--I guess\nUndine won't mind if I don't rig up to-night.\"\n\n\n\nV\n\nShe had looked down at them, enviously, from the balcony--she had looked\nup at them, reverentially, from the stalls; but now at last she was on a\nline with them, among them, she was part of the sacred semicircle whose\nprivilege it is, between the acts, to make the mere public forget that\nthe curtain has fallen.\n\nAs she swept to the left-hand seat of their crimson niche, waving\nMabel Lipscomb to the opposite corner with a gesture learned during\nher apprenticeship in the stalls, Undine felt that quickening of the\nfaculties that comes in the high moments of life. Her consciousness\nseemed to take in at once the whole bright curve of the auditorium, from\nthe unbroken lines of spectators below her to the culminating blaze\nof the central chandelier; and she herself was the core of that vast\nillumination, the sentient throbbing surface which gathered all the\nshafts of light into a centre.\n\nIt was almost a relief when, a moment later, the lights sank, the\ncurtain rose, and the focus of illumination was shifted. The music, the\nscenery, and the movement on the stage, were like a rich mist tempering\nthe radiance that shot on her from every side, and giving her time to\nsubside, draw breath, adjust herself to this new clear medium which made\nher feel so oddly brittle and transparent.\n\nWhen the curtain fell on the first act she began to be aware of a subtle\nchange in the house. In all the boxes cross-currents of movement had\nset in: groups were coalescing and breaking up, fans waving and heads\ntwinkling, black coats emerging among white shoulders, late comers\ndropping their furs and laces in the red penumbra of the background.\nUndine, for the moment unconscious of herself, swept the house with her\nopera-glass, searching for familiar faces. Some she knew without being\nable to name them--fixed figure-heads of the social prow--others she\nrecognized from their portraits in the papers; but of the few from whom\nshe could herself claim recognition not one was visible, and as she\npursued her investigations the whole scene grew blank and featureless.\n\nAlmost all the boxes were full now, but one, just opposite, tantalized\nher by its continued emptiness. How queer to have an opera-box and not\nuse it! What on earth could the people be doing--what rarer delight\ncould they be tasting? Undine remembered that the numbers of the boxes\nand the names of their owners were given on the back of the programme,\nand after a rapid computation she turned to consult the list. Mondays\nand Fridays, Mrs. Peter Van Degen. That was it: the box was empty\nbecause Mrs. Van Degen was dining alone with Ralph Marvell! \"PETER WILL\nBE AT ONE OF HIS DINNERS.\" Undine had a sharp vision of the Van Degen\ndining-room--she pictured it as oak-carved and sumptuous with gilding\n--with a small table in the centre, and rosy lights and flowers, and\nRalph Marvell, across the hot-house grapes and champagne, leaning to\ntake a light from his hostess's cigarette. Undine had seen such scenes\non the stage, she had come upon them in the glowing pages of fiction,\nand it seemed to her that every detail was before her now, from the\nglitter of jewels on Mrs. Van Degen's bare shoulders to the way young\nMarvell stroked his slight blond moustache while he smiled and listened.\n\nUndine blushed with anger at her own simplicity in fancying that he had\nbeen \"taken\" by her--that she could ever really count among these happy\nself-absorbed people! They all had their friends, their ties, their\ndelightful crowding obligations: why should they make room for an\nintruder in a circle so packed with the initiated?\n\nAs her imagination developed the details of the scene in the Van Degen\ndining-room it became clear to her that fashionable society was horribly\nimmoral and that she could never really be happy in such a poisoned\natmosphere. She remembered that an eminent divine was preaching a series\nof sermons against Social Corruption, and she determined to go and hear\nhim on the following Sunday.\n\nThis train of thought was interrupted by the feeling that she was being\nintently observed from the neighbouring box. She turned around with a\nfeint of speaking to Mrs. Lipscomb, and met the bulging stare of Peter\nVan Degen. He was standing behind the lady of the eye-glass, who had\nreplaced her tortoise-shell implement by one of closely-set brilliants,\nwhich, at word from her companion, she critically bent on Undine.\n\n\"No--I don't remember,\" she said; and the girl reddened, divining\nherself unidentified after this protracted scrutiny.\n\nBut there was no doubt as to young Van Degen's remembering her. She was\neven conscious that he was trying to provoke in her some reciprocal sign\nof recognition; and the attempt drove her to the haughty study of her\nprogramme.\n\n\"Why, there's Mr. Popple over there!\" exclaimed Mabel Lipscomb, making\nlarge signs across the house with fan and play-bill.\n\nUndine had already become aware that Mabel, planted, blond and brimming,\ntoo near the edge of the box, was somehow out of scale and out of\ndrawing; and the freedom of her demonstrations increased the effect\nof disproportion. No one else was wagging and waving in that way: a\ngestureless mute telegraphy seemed to pass between the other boxes.\nStill, Undine could not help following Mrs. Lipscomb's glance, and\nthere in fact was Claud Popple, taller and more dominant than ever, and\nbending easily over what she felt must be the back of a brilliant woman.\n\nHe replied by a discreet salute to Mrs. Lipscomb's intemperate\nmotions, and Undine saw the brilliant woman's opera-glass turn in their\ndirection, and said to herself that in a moment Mr. Popple would be\n\"round.\" But the entr'acte wore on, and no one turned the handle of\ntheir door, or disturbed the peaceful somnolence of Harry Lipscomb, who,\nnot being (as he put it) \"onto\" grand opera, had abandoned the struggle\nand withdrawn to the seclusion of the inner box. Undine jealously\nwatched Mr. Popple's progress from box to box, from brilliant woman to\nbrilliant woman; but just as it seemed about to carry him to their door\nhe reappeared at his original post across the house.\n\n\"Undie, do look--there's Mr. Marvell!\" Mabel began again, with another\nconspicuous outbreak of signalling; and this time Undine flushed to the\nnape as Mrs. Peter Van Degen appeared in the opposite box with Ralph\nMarvell behind her. The two seemed to be alone in the box--as they had\ndoubtless been alone all the evening!--and Undine furtively turned\nto see if Mr. Van Degen shared her disapproval. But Mr. Van Degen had\ndisappeared, and Undine, leaning forward, nervously touched Mabel's arm.\n\n\"What's the matter. Undine? Don't you see Mr. Marvell over there? Is\nthat his sister he's with?\"\n\n\"No.--I wouldn't beckon like that,\" Undine whispered between her teeth.\n\n\"Why not? Don't you want him to know you're here?\"\n\n\"Yes--but the other people are not beckoning.\"\n\nMabel looked about unabashed. \"Perhaps they've all found each other.\nShall I send Harry over to tell him?\" she shouted above the blare of the\nwind instruments.\n\n\"NO!\" gasped Undine as the curtain rose.\n\nShe was no longer capable of following the action on the stage. Two\npresences possessed her imagination: that of Ralph Marvell, small,\nunattainable, remote, and that of Mabel Lipscomb, near-by, immense and\nirrepressible.\n\nIt had become clear to Undine that Mabel Lipscomb was ridiculous. That\nwas the reason why Popple did not come to the box. No one would care to\nbe seen talking to her while Mabel was at her side: Mabel, monumental\nand moulded while the fashionable were flexible and diaphanous, Mabel\nstrident and explicit while they were subdued and allusive. At the\nStentorian she was the centre of her group--here she revealed herself\nas unknown and unknowing. Why, she didn't even know that Mrs. Peter Van\nDegen was not Ralph Marvell's sister! And she had a way of trumpeting\nout her ignorances that jarred on Undine's subtler methods. It was\nprecisely at this point that there dawned on Undine what was to be one\nof the guiding principles of her career: \"IT'S BETTER TO WATCH THAN TO\nASK QUESTIONS.\"\n\nThe curtain fell again, and Undine's eyes flew back to the Van Degen\nbox. Several men were entering it together, and a moment later she saw\nRalph Marvell rise from his seat and pass out. Half-unconsciously she\nplaced herself in such a way as to have an eye on the door of the box.\nBut its handle remained unturned, and Harry Lipscomb, leaning back\non the sofa, his head against the opera cloaks, continued to breathe\nstentorously through his open mouth and stretched his legs a little\nfarther across the threshold...\n\nThe entr'acte was nearly over when the door opened and two gentlemen\nstumbled over Mr. Lipscomb's legs. The foremost was Claud Walsingham\nPopple; and above his shoulder shone the batrachian countenance of Peter\nVan Degen. A brief murmur from Mr. Popple made his companion known to\nthe two ladies, and Mr. Van Degen promptly seated himself behind Undine,\nrelegating the painter to Mrs. Lipscomb's elbow.\n\n\"Queer go--I happened to see your friend there waving to old Popp across\nthe house. So I bolted over and collared him: told him he'd got to\nintroduce me before he was a minute older. I tried to find out who\nyou were the other day at the Motor Show--no, where was it? Oh, those\npictures at Goldmark's. What d'you think of 'em, by the way? You ought\nto be painted yourself--no, I mean it, you know--you ought to get old\nPopp to do you. He'd do your hair ripplingly. You must let me come and\ntalk to you about it... About the picture or your hair? Well, your hair\nif you don't mind. Where'd you say you were staying? Oh, you LIVE here,\ndo you? I say, that's first rate!\"\n\nUndine sat well forward, curving toward him a little, as she had seen\nthe other women do, but holding back sufficiently to let it be visible\nto the house that she was conversing with no less a person than Mr.\nPeter Van Degen. Mr. Popple's talk was certainly more brilliant and\npurposeful, and she saw him cast longing glances at her from behind Mrs.\nLipscomb's shoulder; but she remembered how lightly he had been treated\nat the Fairford dinner, and she wanted--oh, how she wanted!--to have\nRalph Marvell see her talking to Van Degen.\n\nShe poured out her heart to him, improvising an opinion on the pictures\nand an opinion on the music, falling in gaily with his suggestion of\na jolly little dinner some night soon, at the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Martin, and\nstrengthening her position, as she thought, by an easy allusion to her\nacquaintance with Mrs. Van Degen. But at the word her companion's eye\nclouded, and a shade of constraint dimmed his enterprising smile.\n\n\"My wife--? Oh, SHE doesn't go to restaurants--she moves on too high a\nplane. But we'll get old Popp, and Mrs.--, Mrs.--, what'd you say your\nfat friend's name was? Just a select little crowd of four--and some kind\nof a cheerful show afterward... Jove! There's the curtain, and I must\nskip.\"\n\nAs the door closed on him Undine's cheeks burned with resentment. If\nMrs. Van Degen didn't go to restaurants, why had he supposed that\nSHE would? and to have to drag Mabel in her wake! The leaden sense of\nfailure overcame her again. Here was the evening nearly over, and what\nhad it led to? Looking up from the stalls, she had fancied that to sit\nin a box was to be in society--now she saw it might but emphasize one's\nexclusion. And she was burdened with the box for the rest of the season!\nIt was really stupid of her father to have exceeded his instructions:\nwhy had he not done as she told him?... Undine felt helpless and\ntired... hateful memories of Apex crowded back on her. Was it going to\nbe as dreary here as there?\n\nShe felt Lipscomb's loud whisper in her back: \"Say, you girls, I guess\nI'll cut this and come back for you when the show busts up.\" They\nheard him shuffle out of the box, and Mabel settled back to undisturbed\nenjoyment of the stage.\n\nWhen the last entr'acte began Undine stood up, resolved to stay no\nlonger. Mabel, lost in the study of the audience, had not noticed her\nmovement, and as she passed alone into the back of the box the door\nopened and Ralph Marvell came in.\n\nUndine stood with one arm listlessly raised to detach her cloak from the\nwall. Her attitude showed the long slimness of her figure and the fresh\ncurve of the throat below her bent-back head. Her face was paler and\nsofter than usual, and the eyes she rested on Marvell's face looked deep\nand starry under their fixed brows.\n\n\"Oh--you're not going?\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"I thought you weren't coming,\" she answered simply.\n\n\"I waited till now on purpose to dodge your other visitors.\"\n\nShe laughed with pleasure. \"Oh, we hadn't so many!\"\n\nSome intuition had already told her that frankness was the tone to take\nwith him. They sat down together on the red damask sofa, against the\nhanging cloaks. As Undine leaned back her hair caught in the spangles of\nthe wrap behind her, and she had to sit motionless while the young man\nfreed the captive mesh. Then they settled themselves again, laughing a\nlittle at the incident.\n\nA glance had made the situation clear to Mrs. Lipscomb, and they saw her\nreturn to her rapt inspection of the boxes. In their mirror-hung recess\nthe light was subdued to a rosy dimness and the hum of the audience came\nto them through half-drawn silken curtains. Undine noticed the delicacy\nand finish of her companion's features as his head detached itself\nagainst the red silk walls. The hand with which he stroked his small\nmoustache was finely-finished too, but sinewy and not effeminate. She\nhad always associated finish and refinement entirely with her own sex,\nbut she began to think they might be even more agreeable in a man.\nMarvell's eyes were grey, like her own, with chestnut eyebrows and\ndarker lashes; and his skin was as clear as a woman's, but pleasantly\nreddish, like his hands.\n\nAs he sat talking in a low tone, questioning her about the music, asking\nher what she had been doing since he had last seen her, she was aware\nthat he looked at her less than usual, and she also glanced away; but\nwhen she turned her eyes suddenly they always met his gaze.\n\nHis talk remained impersonal. She was a little disappointed that he did\nnot compliment her on her dress or her hair--Undine was accustomed to\nhearing a great deal about her hair, and the episode of the spangles had\nopened the way to a graceful allusion--but the instinct of sex told\nher that, under his quiet words, he was throbbing with the sense of her\nproximity. And his self-restraint sobered her, made her refrain from the\nflashing and fidgeting which were the only way she knew of taking part\nin the immemorial love-dance. She talked simply and frankly of herself,\nof her parents, of how few people they knew in New York, and of how, at\ntimes, she was almost sorry she had persuaded them to give up Apex.\n\n\"You see, they did it entirely on my account; they're awfully lonesome\nhere; and I don't believe I shall ever learn New York ways either,\" she\nconfessed, turning on him the eyes of youth and truthfulness. \"Of course\nI know a few people; but they're not--not the way I expected New York\npeople to be.\" She risked what seemed an involuntary glance at Mabel.\n\"I've seen girls here to-night that I just LONG to know--they look so\nlovely and refined--but I don't suppose I ever shall. New York's not\nvery friendly to strange girls, is it? I suppose you've got so many of\nyour own already--and they're all so fascinating you don't care!\" As\nshe spoke she let her eyes rest on his, half-laughing, half-wistful, and\nthen dropped her lashes while the pink stole slowly up to them.\n\nWhen he left her he asked if he might hope to find her at home the next\nday.\n\nThe night was fine, and Marvell, having put his cousin into her motor,\nstarted to walk home to Washington Square. At the corner he was joined\nby Mr. Popple. \"Hallo, Ralph, old man--did you run across our auburn\nbeauty of the Stentorian? Who'd have thought old Harry Lipscomb'd have\nput us onto anything as good as that? Peter Van Degen was fairly taken\noff his feet--pulled me out of Mrs. Monty Thurber's box and dragged me\n'round by the collar to introduce him. Planning a dinner at Martin's\nalready. Gad, young Peter must have what he wants WHEN he wants it!\nI put in a word for you--told him you and I ought to be let in on the\nground floor. Funny the luck some girls have about getting started. I\nbelieve this one'll take if she can manage to shake the Lipscombs. I\nthink I'll ask to paint her; might be a good thing for the spring show.\nShe'd show up splendidly as a PENDANT to my Mrs. Van Degen--Blonde and\nBrunette... Night and Morning... Of course I prefer Mrs. Van Degen's\ntype--personally, I MUST have breeding--but as a mere bit of flesh and\nblood... hallo, ain't you coming into the club?\"\n\nMarvell was not coming into the club, and he drew a long breath of\nrelief as his companion left him.\n\nWas it possible that he had ever thought leniently of the egregious\nPopple? The tone of social omniscience which he had once found so comic\nwas now as offensive to him as a coarse physical touch. And the worst of\nit was that Popple, with the slight exaggeration of a caricature, really\nexpressed the ideals of the world he frequented. As he spoke of Miss\nSpragg, so others at any rate would think of her: almost every one in\nRalph's set would agree that it was luck for a girl from Apex to be\nstarted by Peter Van Degen at a Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Martin dinner...\n\nRalph Marvell, mounting his grandfather's doorstep, looked up at the\nsymmetrical old red house-front, with its frugal marble ornament, as he\nmight have looked into a familiar human face.\n\n\"They're right,--after all, in some ways they're right,\" he murmured,\nslipping his key into the door.\n\n\"They\" were his mother and old Mr. Urban Dagonet, both, from Ralph's\nearliest memories, so closely identified with the old house\nin Washington Square that they might have passed for its inner\nconsciousness as it might have stood for their outward form; and the\nquestion as to which the house now seemed to affirm their intrinsic\nrightness was that of the social disintegration expressed by\nwidely-different architectural physiognomies at the other end of Fifth\nAvenue. As Ralph pushed the bolts behind him, and passed into the hall,\nwith its dark mahogany doors and the quiet \"Dutch interior\" effect of\nits black and white marble paving, he said to himself that what Popple\ncalled society was really just like the houses it lived in: a muddle of\nmisapplied ornament over a thin steel shell of utility. The steel shell\nwas built up in Wall Street, the social trimmings were hastily added\nin Fifth Avenue; and the union between them was as monstrous and\nfactitious, as unlike the gradual homogeneous growth which flowers\ninto what other countries know as society, as that between the Blois\ngargoyles on Peter Van Degen's roof and the skeleton walls supporting\nthem.\n\nThat was what \"they\" had always said; what, at least, the Dagonet\nattitude, the Dagonet view of life, the very lines of the furniture in\nthe old Dagonet house expressed. Ralph sometimes called his mother and\ngrandfather the Aborigines, and likened them to those vanishing denizens\nof the American continent doomed to rapid extinction with the advance\nof the invading race. He was fond of describing Washington Square as the\n\"Reservation,\" and of prophesying that before long its inhabitants would\nbe exhibited at ethnological shows, pathetically engaged in the exercise\nof their primitive industries.\n\nSmall, cautious, middle-class, had been the ideals of aboriginal New\nYork; but it suddenly struck the young man that they were singularly\ncoherent and respectable as contrasted with the chaos of indiscriminate\nappetites which made up its modern tendencies. He too had wanted to be\n\"modern,\" had revolted, half-humorously, against the restrictions and\nexclusions of the old code; and it must have been by one of the ironic\nreversions of heredity that, at this precise point, he began to see what\nthere was to be said on the other side--his side, as he now felt it to\nbe.\n\n\n\nVI\n\nUpstairs, in his brown firelit room, he threw himself into an armchair,\nand remembered... Harvard first--then Oxford; then a year of wandering\nand rich initiation. Returning to New York, he had read law, and now\nhad his desk in the office of the respectable firm in whose charge the\nDagonet estate had mouldered for several generations. But his profession\nwas the least real thing in his life. The realities lay about him now:\nthe books jamming his old college bookcases and overflowing on chairs\nand tables; sketches too--he could do charming things, if only he had\nknown how to finish them!--and, on the writing-table at his elbow,\nscattered sheets of prose and verse; charming things also, but, like the\nsketches, unfinished.\n\nNothing in the Dagonet and Marvell tradition was opposed to this\ndesultory dabbling with life. For four or five generations it had been\nthe rule of both houses that a young fellow should go to Columbia or\nHarvard, read law, and then lapse into more or less cultivated inaction.\nThe only essential was that he should live \"like a gentleman\"--that is,\nwith a tranquil disdain for mere money-getting, a passive openness to\nthe finer sensations, one or two fixed principles as to the quality of\nwine, and an archaic probity that had not yet learned to distinguish\nbetween private and \"business\" honour.\n\nNo equipment could more thoroughly have unfitted the modern youth for\ngetting on: it hardly needed the scribbled pages on the desk to complete\nthe hopelessness of Ralph Marvell's case. He had accepted the fact with\na humorous fatalism. Material resources were limited on both sides of\nthe house, but there would always be enough for his frugal wants--enough\nto buy books (not \"editions\"), and pay now and then for a holiday dash\nto the great centres of art and ideas. And meanwhile there was the world\nof wonders within him. As a boy at the sea-side, Ralph, between tides,\nhad once come on a cave--a secret inaccessible place with glaucous\nlights, mysterious murmurs, and a single shaft of communication with the\nsky. He had kept his find from the other boys, not churlishly, for he\nwas always an outspoken lad, but because he felt there were things about\nthe cave that the others, good fellows as they all were, couldn't be\nexpected to understand, and that, anyhow, it would never be quite his\ncave again after he had let his thick-set freckled cousins play smuggler\nand pirate in it.\n\nAnd so with his inner world. Though so coloured by outer impressions,\nit wove a secret curtain about him, and he came and went in it with\nthe same joy of furtive possession. One day, of course, some one would\ndiscover it and reign there with him--no, reign over it and him. Once or\ntwice already a light foot had reached the threshold. His cousin Clare\nDagonet, for instance: there had been a summer when her voice had\nsounded far down the windings... but he had run over to Spain for the\nautumn, and when he came back she was engaged to Peter Van Degen, and\nfor a while it looked black in the cave. That was long ago, as time is\nreckoned under thirty; and for three years now he had felt for her only\na half-contemptuous pity. To have stood at the mouth of his cave, and\nhave turned from it to the Van Degen lair--!\n\nPoor Clare repented, indeed--she wanted it clearly but she repented in\nthe Van Degen diamonds, and the Van Degen motor bore her broken heart\nfrom opera to ball. She had been subdued to what she worked in, and she\ncould never again find her way to the enchanted cave... Ralph, since\nthen, had reached the point of deciding that he would never marry;\nreached it not suddenly or dramatically, but with such sober advisedness\nas is urged on those about to take the opposite step. What he most\nwanted, now that the first flutter of being was over, was to learn and\nto do--to know what the great people had thought, think about their\nthinking, and then launch his own boat: write some good verse if\npossible; if not, then critical prose. A dramatic poem lay among the\nstuff at his elbow; but the prose critic was at his elbow too, and not\nto be satisfied about the poem; and poet and critic passed the nights\nin hot if unproductive debate. On the whole, it seemed likely that the\ncritic would win the day, and the essay on \"The Rhythmical Structures of\nWalt Whitman\" take shape before \"The Banished God.\" Yet if the light in\nthe cave was less supernaturally blue, the chant of its tides less laden\nwith unimaginable music, it was still a thronged and echoing place when\nUndine Spragg appeared on its threshold...\n\nHis mother and sister of course wanted him to marry. They had the usual\ntheory that he was \"made\" for conjugal bliss: women always thought that\nof a fellow who didn't get drunk and have low tastes. Ralph smiled at\nthe idea as he sat crouched among his secret treasures. Marry--but whom,\nin the name of light and freedom? The daughters of his own race sold\nthemselves to the Invaders; the daughters of the Invaders bought\ntheir husbands as they bought an opera-box. It ought all to have been\ntransacted on the Stock Exchange. His mother, he knew, had no such\nambitions for him: she would have liked him to fancy a \"nice girl\" like\nHarriet Ray.\n\nHarriet Ray was neither vulgar nor ambitious. She regarded Washington\nSquare as the birthplace of Society, knew by heart all the cousinships\nof early New York, hated motor-cars, could not make herself understood\non the telephone, and was determined, if she married, never to receive\na divorced woman. As Mrs. Marvell often said, such girls as Harriet were\ngrowing rare. Ralph was not sure about this. He was inclined to think\nthat, certain modifications allowed for, there would always be plenty of\nHarriet Rays for unworldly mothers to commend to their sons; and he had\nno desire to diminish their number by removing one from the ranks of the\nmarriageable. He had no desire to marry at all--that had been the whole\ntruth of it till he met Undine Spragg. And now--? He lit a cigar, and\nbegan to recall his hour's conversation with Mrs. Spragg.\n\nRalph had never taken his mother's social faiths very seriously.\nSurveying the march of civilization from a loftier angle, he had early\nmingled with the Invaders, and curiously observed their rites and\ncustoms. But most of those he had met had already been modified by\ncontact with the indigenous: they spoke the same language as his, though\non their lips it had often so different a meaning. Ralph had never seen\nthem actually in the making, before they had acquired the speech of the\nconquered race. But Mrs. Spragg still used the dialect of her people,\nand before the end of the visit Ralph had ceased to regret that her\ndaughter was out. He felt obscurely that in the girl's presence--frank\nand simple as he thought her--he should have learned less of life in\nearly Apex.\n\nMrs. Spragg, once reconciled--or at least resigned--to the mysterious\nnecessity of having to \"entertain\" a friend of Undine's, had yielded to\nthe first touch on the weak springs of her garrulity. She had not seen\nMrs. Heeny for two days, and this friendly young man with the gentle\nmanner was almost as easy to talk to as the masseuse. And then she could\ntell him things that Mrs. Heeny already knew, and Mrs. Spragg liked\nto repeat her stories. To do so gave her almost her sole sense of\npermanence among the shifting scenes of life. So that, after she had\nlengthily deplored the untoward accident of Undine's absence, and her\nvisitor, with a smile, and echoes of divers et ondoyant in his brain,\nhad repeated her daughter's name after her, saying: \"It's a wonderful\nfind--how could you tell it would be such a fit?\"--it came to her quite\neasily to answer: \"Why, we called her after a hair-waver father put on\nthe market the week she was born--\" and then to explain, as he remained\nstruck and silent: \"It's from UNdoolay, you know, the French for\ncrimping; father always thought the name made it take. He was quite a\nscholar, and had the greatest knack for finding names. I remember the\ntime he invented his Goliath Glue he sat up all night over the Bible to\nget the name... No, father didn't start IN as a druggist,\" she went on,\nexpanding with the signs of Marvell's interest; \"he was educated for\nan undertaker, and built up a first-class business; but he was always\na beautiful speaker, and after a while he sorter drifted into the\nministry. Of course it didn't pay him anything like as well, so finally\nhe opened a drug-store, and he did first-rate at that too, though his\nheart was always in the pulpit. But after he made such a success with\nhis hair-waver he got speculating in land out at Apex, and somehow\neverything went--though Mr. Spragg did all he COULD--.\" Mrs. Spragg,\nwhen she found herself embarked on a long sentence, always ballasted it\nby italicizing the last word.\n\nHer husband, she continued, could not, at the time, do much for his\nfather-in-law. Mr. Spragg had come to Apex as a poor boy, and their\nearly married life had been a protracted struggle, darkened by domestic\naffliction. Two of their three children had died of typhoid in the\nepidemic which devastated Apex before the new water-works were built;\nand this calamity, by causing Mr. Spragg to resolve that thereafter\nApex should drink pure water, had led directly to the founding of his\nfortunes.\n\n\"He had taken over some of poor father's land for a bad debt, and when\nhe got up the Pure Water move the company voted to buy the land and\nbuild the new reservoir up there: and after that we began to be better\noff, and it DID seem as if it had come out so to comfort us some about\nthe children.\"\n\nMr. Spragg, thereafter, had begun to be a power in Apex, and fat years\nhad followed on the lean. Ralph Marvell was too little versed in affairs\nto read between the lines of Mrs. Spragg's untutored narrative, and he\nunderstood no more than she the occult connection between Mr. Spragg's\ndomestic misfortunes and his business triumph. Mr. Spragg had \"helped\nout\" his ruined father-in-law, and had vowed on his children's graves\nthat no Apex child should ever again drink poisoned water--and out\nof those two disinterested impulses, by some impressive law of\ncompensation, material prosperity had come. What Ralph understood and\nappreciated was Mrs. Spragg's unaffected frankness in talking of her\nearly life. Here was no retrospective pretense of an opulent past,\nsuch as the other Invaders were given to parading before the bland but\nundeceived subject race. The Spraggs had been \"plain people\" and had not\nyet learned to be ashamed of it. The fact drew them much closer to the\nDagonet ideals than any sham elegance in the past tense. Ralph felt\nthat his mother, who shuddered away from Mrs. Harmon B. Driscoll, would\nunderstand and esteem Mrs. Spragg.\n\nBut how long would their virgin innocence last? Popple's vulgar hands\nwere on it already--Popple's and the unspeakable Van Degen's! Once they\nand theirs had begun the process of initiating Undine, there was no\nknowing--or rather there was too easy knowing--how it would end! It was\nincredible that she too should be destined to swell the ranks of the\ncheaply fashionable; yet were not her very freshness, her malleability,\nthe mark of her fate? She was still at the age when the flexible soul\noffers itself to the first grasp. That the grasp should chance to be Van\nDegen's--that was what made Ralph's temples buzz, and swept away all his\nplans for his own future like a beaver's dam in a spring flood. To\nsave her from Van Degen and Van Degenism: was that really to be his\nmission--the \"call\" for which his life had obscurely waited? It was\nnot in the least what he had meant to do with the fugitive flash of\nconsciousness he called self; but all that he had purposed for that\ntransitory being sank into insignificance under the pressure of Undine's\nclaims.\n\nRalph Marvell's notion of women had been formed on the experiences\ncommon to good-looking young men of his kind. Women were drawn to him as\nmuch by his winning appealing quality, by the sense of a youthful warmth\nbehind his light ironic exterior, as by his charms of face and mind.\nExcept during Clare Dagonet's brief reign the depths in him had not been\nstirred; but in taking what each sentimental episode had to give he\nhad preserved, through all his minor adventures, his faith in the great\nadventure to come. It was this faith that made him so easy a victim\nwhen love had at last appeared clad in the attributes of romance: the\nimaginative man's indestructible dream of a rounded passion.\n\nThe clearness with which he judged the girl and himself seemed the\nsurest proof that his feeling was more than a surface thrill. He was not\nblind to her crudity and her limitations, but they were a part of her\ngrace and her persuasion. Diverse et ondoyante--so he had seen her from\nthe first. But was not that merely the sign of a quicker response to the\nworld's manifold appeal? There was Harriet Ray, sealed up tight in the\nvacuum of inherited opinion, where not a breath of fresh sensation could\nget at her: there could be no call to rescue young ladies so\nsecured from the perils of reality! Undine had no such traditional\nsafeguards--Ralph guessed Mrs. Spragg's opinions to be as fluid as\nher daughter's--and the girl's very sensitiveness to new impressions,\ncombined with her obvious lack of any sense of relative values, would\nmake her an easy prey to the powers of folly. He seemed to see her--as\nhe sat there, pressing his fists into his temples--he seemed to see her\nlike a lovely rock-bound Andromeda, with the devouring monster Society\ncareering up to make a mouthful of her; and himself whirling down on his\nwinged horse--just Pegasus turned Rosinante for the nonce--to cut her\nbonds, snatch her up, and whirl her back into the blue...\n\n\n\nVII\n\nSome two months later than the date of young Marvell's midnight vigil,\nMrs. Heeny, seated on a low chair at Undine's knee, gave the girl's left\nhand an approving pat as she laid aside her lapful of polishers.\n\n\"There! I guess you can put your ring on again,\" she said with a laugh\nof jovial significance; and Undine, echoing the laugh in a murmur of\ncomplacency, slipped on the fourth finger of her recovered hand a band\nof sapphires in an intricate setting.\n\nMrs. Heeny took up the hand again. \"Them's old stones, Undine--they've\ngot a different look,\" she said, examining the ring while she rubbed her\ncushioned palm over the girl's brilliant finger-tips. \"And the setting's\nquaint--I wouldn't wonder but what it was one of old Gran'ma Dagonet's.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg, hovering near in fond beatitude, looked up quickly.\n\n\"Why, don't you s'pose he BOUGHT it for her, Mrs. Heeny? It came in a\nTiff'ny box.\"\n\nThe manicure laughed again. \"Of course he's had Tiff'ny rub it up.\nAin't you ever heard of ancestral jewels, Mrs. Spragg? In the Eu-ropean\naristocracy they never go out and BUY engagement-rings; and Undine's\nmarrying into our aristocracy.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg looked relieved. \"Oh, I thought maybe they were trying to\nscrimp on the ring--\"\n\nMrs. Heeny, shrugging away this explanation, rose from her seat and\nrolled back her shiny black sleeves.\n\n\"Look at here, Undine, if you really want me to do your hair it's time\nwe got to work.\"\n\nThe girl swung about in her seat so that she faced the mirror on the\ndressing-table. Her shoulders shone through transparencies of lace\nand muslin which slipped back as she lifted her arms to draw the\ntortoise-shell pins from her hair.\n\n\"Of course you've got to do it--I want to look perfectly lovely!\"\n\n\"Well--I dunno's my hand's in nowadays,\" said Mrs. Heeny in a tone that\nbelied the doubt she cast on her own ability.\n\n\"Oh, you're an ARTIST, Mrs. Heeny--and I just couldn't have had that\nFrench maid 'round to-night,\" sighed Mrs. Spragg, sinking into a chair\nnear the dressing-table.\n\nUndine, with a backward toss of her head, scattered her loose locks\nabout her. As they spread and sparkled under Mrs. Heeny's touch, Mrs.\nSpragg leaned back, drinking in through half-closed lids her daughter's\nloveliness. Some new quality seemed added to Undine's beauty: it had a\nmilder bloom, a kind of melting grace, which might have been lent to it\nby the moisture in her mother's eyes.\n\n\"So you're to see the old gentleman for the first time at this dinner?\"\nMrs. Heeny pursued, sweeping the live strands up into a loosely woven\ncrown.\n\n\"Yes. I'm frightened to death!\" Undine, laughing confidently, took up a\nhand-glass and scrutinized the small brown mole above the curve of her\nupper lip.\n\n\"I guess she'll know how to talk to him,\" Mrs. Spragg averred with a\nkind of quavering triumph.\n\n\"She'll know how to LOOK at him, anyhow,\" said Mrs. Heeny; and Undine\nsmiled at her own image.\n\n\"I hope he won't think I'm too awful!\"\n\nMrs. Heeny laughed. \"Did you read the description of yourself in the\nRadiator this morning? I wish't I'd 'a had time to cut it out. I guess\nI'll have to start a separate bag for YOUR clippings soon.\"\n\nUndine stretched her arms luxuriously above her head and gazed through\nlowered lids at the foreshortened reflection of her face.\n\n\"Mercy! Don't jerk about like that. Am I to put in this\nrose?--There--you ARE lovely!\" Mrs. Heeny sighed, as the pink petals\nsank into the hair above the girl's forehead. Undine pushed her chair\nback, and sat supporting her chin on her clasped hands while she studied\nthe result of Mrs. Heeny's manipulations.\n\n\"Yes--that's the way Mrs. Peter Van Degen's flower was put in the other\nnight; only hers was a camellia.--Do you think I'd look better with a\ncamellia?\"\n\n\"I guess if Mrs. Van Degen looked like a rose she'd 'a worn a rose,\"\nMrs. Heeny rejoined poetically. \"Sit still a minute longer,\" she added.\n\"Your hair's so heavy I'd feel easier if I was to put in another pin.\"\n\nUndine remained motionless, and the manicure, suddenly laying both hands\non the girl's shoulders, and bending over to peer at her reflection,\nsaid playfully: \"Ever been engaged before, Undine?\"\n\nA blush rose to the face in the mirror, spreading from chin to brow, and\nrunning rosily over the white shoulders from which their covering had\nslipped down.\n\n\"My! If he could see you now!\" Mrs. Heeny jested.\n\nMrs. Spragg, rising noiselessly, glided across the room and became lost\nin a minute examination of the dress laid out on the bed.\n\nWith a supple twist Undine slipped from Mrs. Heeny's hold.\n\n\"Engaged? Mercy, yes! Didn't you know? To the Prince of Wales. I broke\nit off because I wouldn't live in the Tower.\"\n\nMrs. Spragg, lifting the dress cautiously over her arm, advanced with a\nreassured smile.\n\n\"I s'pose Undie'll go to Europe now,\" she said to Mrs. Heeny.\n\n\"I guess Undie WILL!\" the young lady herself declared. \"We're going\nto sail right afterward.--Here, mother, do be careful of my hair!\" She\nducked gracefully to slip into the lacy fabric which her mother held\nabove her head. As she rose Venus-like above its folds there was a tap\non the door, immediately followed by its tentative opening.\n\n\"Mabel!\" Undine muttered, her brows lowering like her father's; and\nMrs. Spragg, wheeling about to screen her daughter, addressed herself\nprotestingly to the half-open door.\n\n\"Who's there? Oh, that YOU, Mrs. Lipscomb? Well, I don't know as you\nCAN--Undie isn't half dressed yet--\"\n\n\"Just like her--always pushing in!\" Undine murmured as she slipped her\narms into their transparent sleeves.\n\n\"Oh, that don't matter--I'll help dress her!\" Mrs. Lipscomb's large\nblond person surged across the threshold. \"Seems to me I ought to lend a\nhand to-night, considering I was the one that introduced them!\"\n\nUndine forced a smile, but Mrs. Spragg, her soft wrinkles deepening with\nresentment, muttered to Mrs. Heeny, as she bent down to shake out the\ngirl's train: \"I guess my daughter's only got to show herself--\"\n\nThe first meeting with old Mr. Dagonet was less formidable than Undine\nhad expected. She had been once before to the house in Washington\nSquare, when, with her mother, she had returned Mrs. Marvell's\nceremonial visit; but on that occasion Ralph's grandfather had not\nbeen present. All the rites connected with her engagement were new and\nmysterious to Undine, and none more so than the unaccountable necessity\nof \"dragging\"--as she phrased it--Mrs. Spragg into the affair. It was\nan accepted article of the Apex creed that parental detachment should be\ncompletest at the moment when the filial fate was decided; and to find\nthat New York reversed this rule was as puzzling to Undine as to her\nmother. Mrs. Spragg was so unprepared for the part she was to play\nthat on the occasion of her visit to Mrs. Marvell her helplessness had\ninfected Undine, and their half-hour in the sober faded drawing-room\nremained among the girl's most unsatisfactory memories.\n\nShe re-entered it alone with more assurance. Her confidence in her\nbeauty had hitherto carried her through every ordeal; and it was\nfortified now by the feeling of power that came with the sense of being\nloved. If they would only leave her mother out she was sure, in her\nown phrase, of being able to \"run the thing\"; and Mrs. Spragg had\nprovidentially been left out of the Dagonet dinner.\n\nIt was to consist, it appeared, only of the small family group Undine\nhad already met; and, seated at old Mr. Dagonet's right, in the high\ndark dining-room with mahogany doors and dim portraits of \"Signers\"\nand their females, she felt a conscious joy in her ascendancy. Old Mr.\nDagonet--small, frail and softly sardonic--appeared to fall at once\nunder her spell. If she felt, beneath his amenity, a kind of delicate\ndangerousness, like that of some fine surgical instrument, she ignored\nit as unimportant; for she had as yet no clear perception of forces that\ndid not directly affect her.\n\nMrs. Marvell, low-voiced, faded, yet impressive, was less responsive\nto her arts, and Undine divined in her the head of the opposition to\nRalph's marriage. Mrs. Heeny had reported that Mrs. Marvell had other\nviews for her son; and this was confirmed by such echoes of the short\nsharp struggle as reached the throbbing listeners at the Stentorian. But\nthe conflict over, the air had immediately cleared, showing the enemy in\nthe act of unconditional surrender. It surprised Undine that there had\nbeen no reprisals, no return on the points conceded. That was not her\nidea of warfare, and she could ascribe the completeness of the victory\nonly to the effect of her charms.\n\nMrs. Marvell's manner did not express entire subjugation; yet she seemed\nanxious to dispel any doubts of her good faith, and if she left the\nburden of the talk to her lively daughter it might have been because\nshe felt more capable of showing indulgence by her silence than in her\nspeech.\n\nAs for Mrs. Fairford, she had never seemed more brilliantly bent\non fusing the various elements under her hand. Undine had already\ndiscovered that she adored her brother, and had guessed that this\nwould make her either a strong ally or a determined enemy. The latter\nalternative, however, did not alarm the girl. She thought Mrs. Fairford\n\"bright,\" and wanted to be liked by her; and she was in the state of\ndizzy self-assurance when it seemed easy to win any sympathy she chose\nto seek.\n\nFor the only other guests--Mrs. Fairford's husband, and the elderly\nCharles Bowen who seemed to be her special friend--Undine had no\nattention to spare: they remained on a plane with the dim pictures\nhanging at her back. She had expected a larger party; but she was\nrelieved, on the whole, that it was small enough to permit of her\ndominating it. Not that she wished to do so by any loudness of\nassertion. Her quickness in noting external differences had already\ntaught her to modulate and lower her voice, and to replace \"The I-dea!\"\nand \"I wouldn't wonder\" by more polished locutions; and she had not been\nten minutes at table before she found that to seem very much in love,\nand a little confused and subdued by the newness and intensity of the\nsentiment, was, to the Dagonet mind, the becoming attitude for a young\nlady in her situation. The part was not hard to play, for she WAS in\nlove, of course. It was pleasant, when she looked across the table, to\nmeet Ralph's grey eyes, with that new look in them, and to feel that\nshe had kindled it; but I it was only part of her larger pleasure in\nthe general homage to her beauty, in the sensations of interest and\ncuriosity excited by everything about her, from the family portraits\noverhead to the old Dagonet silver on the table--which were to be hers\ntoo, after all!\n\nThe talk, as at Mrs. Fairford's, confused her by its lack of the\npersonal allusion, its tendency to turn to books, pictures and politics.\n\"Politics,\" to Undine, had always been like a kind of back-kitchen to\nbusiness--the place where the refuse was thrown and the doubtful messes\nwere brewed. As a drawing-room topic, and one to provoke disinterested\nsentiments, it had the hollowness of Fourth of July orations, and her\nmind wandered in spite of the desire to appear informed and competent.\n\nOld Mr. Dagonet, with his reedy staccato voice, that gave polish and\nrelief to every syllable, tried to come to her aid by questioning her\naffably about her family and the friends she had made in New York.\nBut the caryatid-parent, who exists simply as a filial prop, is not a\nfruitful theme, and Undine, called on for the first time to view her own\nprogenitors as a subject of conversation, was struck by their lack of\npoints. She had never paused to consider what her father and mother\nwere \"interested\" in, and, challenged to specify, could have named--with\nsincerity--only herself. On the subject of her New York friends it was\nnot much easier to enlarge; for so far her circle had grown less rapidly\nthan she expected. She had fancied Ralph's wooing would at once admit\nher to all his social privileges; but he had shown a puzzling reluctance\nto introduce her to the Van Degen set, where he came and went with such\nfamiliarity; and the persons he seemed anxious to have her know--a few\nfrumpy \"clever women\" of his sister's age, and one or two brisk\nold ladies in shabby houses with mahogany furniture and Stuart\nportraits--did not offer the opportunities she sought.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know many people yet--I tell Ralph he's got to hurry up and\ntake me round,\" she said to Mr. Dagonet, with a side-sparkle for Ralph,\nwhose gaze, between the flowers and lights, she was aware of perpetually\ndrawing.\n\n\"My daughter will take you--you must know his mother's friends,\" the old\ngentleman rejoined while Mrs. Marvell smiled noncommittally.\n\n\"But you have a great friend of your own--the lady who takes you\ninto society,\" Mr. Dagonet pursued; and Undine had the sense that the\nirrepressible Mabel was again \"pushing in.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--Mabel Lipscomb. We were school-mates,\" she said indifferently.\n\n\"Lipscomb? Lipscomb? What is Mr. Lipscomb's occupation?\"\n\n\"He's a broker,\" said Undine, glad to be able to place her friend's\nhusband in so handsome a light. The subtleties of a professional\nclassification unknown to Apex had already taught her that in New York\nit is more distinguished to be a broker than a dentist; and she was\nsurprised at Mr. Dagonet's lack of enthusiasm.\n\n\"Ah? A broker?\" He said it almost as Popple might have said \"A\nDENTIST?\" and Undine found herself astray in a new labyrinth of social\ndistinctions. She felt a sudden contempt for Harry Lipscomb, who\nhad already struck her as too loud, and irrelevantly comic. \"I guess\nMabel'll get a divorce pretty soon,\" she added, desiring, for personal\nreasons, to present Mrs. Lipscomb as favourably as possible.\n\nMr. Dagonet's handsome eye-brows drew together. \"A divorce? H'm--that's\nbad. Has he been misbehaving himself?\"\n\nUndine looked innocently surprised. \"Oh, I guess not. They like each\nother well enough. But he's been a disappointment to her. He isn't\nin the right set, and I think Mabel realizes she'll never really get\nanywhere till she gets rid of him.\"\n\nThese words, uttered in the high fluting tone that she rose to when sure\nof her subject, fell on a pause which prolonged and deepened itself to\nreceive them, while every face at the table, Ralph Marvell's excepted,\nreflected in varying degree Mr. Dagonet's pained astonishment.\n\n\"But, my dear young lady--what would your friend's situation be if, as\nyou put it, she 'got rid' of her husband on so trivial a pretext?\"\n\nUndine, surprised at his dullness, tried to explain. \"Oh that wouldn't\nbe the reason GIVEN, of course. Any lawyer could fix it up for them.\nDon't they generally call it desertion?\"\n\nThere was another, more palpitating, silence, broken by a laugh from\nRalph.\n\n\"RALPH!\" his mother breathed; then, turning to Undine, she said with\na constrained smile: \"I believe in certain parts of the country\nsuch--unfortunate arrangements--are beginning to be tolerated. But in\nNew York, in spite of our growing indifference, a divorced woman is\nstill--thank heaven!--at a decided disadvantage.\"\n\nUndine's eyes opened wide. Here at last was a topic that really\ninterested her, and one that gave another amazing glimpse into the\ncamera obscura of New York society. \"Do you mean to say Mabel would be\nworse off, then? Couldn't she even go round as much as she does now?\"\n\nMrs. Marvell met this gravely. \"It would depend, I should say, on the\nkind of people she wished to see.\"\n\n\"Oh, the very best, of course! That would be her only object.\"\n\nRalph interposed with another laugh. \"You see, Undine, you'd better\nthink twice before you divorce me!\"\n\n\"RALPH!\" his mother again breathed; but the girl, flushed and sparkling,\nflung back: \"Oh, it all depends on YOU! Out in Apex, if a girl marries a\nman who don't come up to what she expected, people consider it's to her\ncredit to want to change. YOU'D better think twice of that!\"\n\n\"If I were only sure of knowing what you expect!\" he caught up her joke,\ntossing it back at her across the fascinated silence of their listeners.\n\n\"Why, EVERYTHING!\" she announced--and Mr. Dagonet, turning, laid an\nintricately-veined old hand on, hers, and said, with a change of tone\nthat relaxed the tension of the listeners: \"My child, if you look like\nthat you'll get it.\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\nIt was doubtless owing to Mrs. Fairford's foresight that such\npossibilities of tension were curtailed, after dinner, by her carrying\noff Ralph and his betrothed to the theatre.\n\nMr. Dagonet, it was understood, always went to bed after an hour's whist\nwith his daughter; and the silent Mr. Fairford gave his evenings to\nbridge at his club. The party, therefore, consisted only of Undine\nand Ralph, with Mrs. Fairford and her attendant friend. Undine vaguely\nwondered why the grave and grey-haired Mr. Bowen formed so invariable a\npart of that lady's train; but she concluded that it was the York custom\nfor married ladies to have gentlemen \"'round\" (as girls had in Apex),\nand that Mr. Bowen was the sole survivor of Laura Fairford's earlier\ntriumphs.\n\nShe had, however, little time to give to such conjectures, for the\nperformance they were attending--the debut of a fashionable London\nactress--had attracted a large audience in which Undine immediately\nrecognized a number of familiar faces. Her engagement had been announced\nonly the day before, and she had the delicious sense of being \"in\nall the papers,\" and of focussing countless glances of interest and\ncuriosity as she swept through the theatre in Mrs. Fairford's wake.\nTheir stalls were near the stage, and progress thither was slow enough\nto permit of prolonged enjoyment of this sensation. Before passing to\nher place she paused for Ralph to remove her cloak, and as he lifted it\nfrom her shoulders she heard a lady say behind her: \"There she is--the\none in white, with the lovely back--\" and a man answer: \"Gad! Where did\nhe find anything as good as that?\"\n\nAnonymous approval was sweet enough; but she was to taste a moment more\nexquisite when, in the proscenium box across the house, she saw Clare\nVan Degen seated beside the prim figure of Miss Harriet Ray. \"They're\nhere to see me with him--they hate it, but they couldn't keep away!\"\nShe turned and lifted a smile of possessorship to Ralph. Mrs. Fairford\nseemed also struck by the presence Of the two ladies, and Undine heard\nher whisper to Mr. Bowen: \"Do you see Clare over there--and Harriet with\nher? Harriet WOULD COME--I call it Spartan! And so like Clare to ask\nher!\"\n\nHer companion laughed. \"It's one of the deepest instincts in human\nnature. The murdered are as much given as the murderer to haunting the\nscene of the crime.\"\n\nDoubtless guessing Ralph's desire to have Undine to himself, Mrs.\nFairford had sent the girl in first; and Undine, as she seated herself,\nwas aware that the occupant of the next stall half turned to her, as\nwith a vague gesture of recognition. But just then the curtain rose, and\nshe became absorbed in the development of the drama, especially as it\ntended to display the remarkable toilets which succeeded each other on\nthe person of its leading lady. Undine, seated at Ralph Marvell's side,\nand feeling the thrill of his proximity as a subtler element in\nthe general interest she was exciting, was at last repaid for the\ndisappointment of her evening at the opera. It was characteristic of her\nthat she remembered her failures as keenly as her triumphs, and that\nthe passionate desire to obliterate, to \"get even\" with them, was always\namong the latent incentives of her conduct. Now at last she was having\nwhat she wanted--she was in conscious possession of the \"real thing\";\nand through her other, diffused, sensations Ralph's adoration gave her\nsuch a last refinement of pleasure as might have come to some warrior\nQueen borne in triumph by captive princes, and reading in the eyes of\none the passion he dared not speak. When the curtain fell this vague\nenjoyment was heightened by various acts of recognition. All the people\nshe wanted to \"go with,\" as they said in Apex, seemed to be about her\nin the stalls and boxes; and her eyes continued to revert with special\nsatisfaction to the incongruous group formed by Mrs. Peter Van Degen and\nMiss Ray. The sight made it irresistible to whisper to Ralph: \"You ought\nto go round and talk to your cousin. Have you told her we're engaged?\"\n\n\"Clare? of course. She's going to call on you tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, she needn't put herself out--she's never been yet,\" said Undine\nloftily.\n\nHe made no rejoinder, but presently asked: \"Who's that you're waving\nto?\"\n\n\"Mr. Popple. He's coming round to see us. You know he wants to paint\nme.\" Undine fluttered and beamed as the brilliant Popple made his way\nacross the stalls to the seat which her neighbour had momentarily left.\n\n\"First-rate chap next to you--whoever he is--to give me this chance,\"\nthe artist declared. \"Ha, Ralph, my boy, how did you pull it off? That's\nwhat we're all of us wondering.\" He leaned over to give Marvell's hand\nthe ironic grasp of celibacy. \"Well, you've left us lamenting: he has,\nyou know. Miss Spragg. But I've got one pull over the others--I can\npaint you! He can't forbid that, can he? Not before marriage, anyhow!\"\n\nUndine divided her shining glances between the two. \"I guess he isn't\ngoing to treat me any different afterward,\" she proclaimed with joyous\ndefiance.\n\n\"Ah, well, there's no telling, you know. Hadn't we better begin at once?\nSeriously, I want awfully to get you into the spring show.\"\n\n\"Oh, really? That would be too lovely!\"\n\n\"YOU would be, certainly--the way I mean to do you. But I see Ralph\ngetting glum. Cheer up, my dear fellow; I daresay you'll be invited to\nsome of the sittings--that's for Miss Spragg to say.--Ah, here comes\nyour neighbour back, confound him--You'll let me know when we can\nbegin?\"\n\nAs Popple moved away Undine turned eagerly to Marvell. \"Do you suppose\nthere's time? I'd love to have him to do me!\"\n\nRalph smiled. \"My poor child--he WOULD 'do' you, with a vengeance.\nInfernal cheek, his asking you to sit--\"\n\nShe stared. \"But why? He's painted your cousin, and all the smart\nwomen.\"\n\n\"Oh, if a 'smart' portrait's all you want!\"\n\n\"I want what the others want,\" she answered, frowning and pouting a\nlittle. She was already beginning to resent in Ralph the slightest\nsign of resistance to her pleasure; and her resentment took the\nform--a familiar one in Apex courtships--of turning on him, in the next\nentr'acte, a deliberately averted shoulder. The result of this was to\nbring her, for the first time, in more direct relation to her other\nneighbour. As she turned he turned too, showing her, above a shining\nshirt-front fastened with a large imitation pearl, a ruddy plump snub\nface without an angle in it, which yet looked sharper than a razor.\nUndine's eyes met his with a startled look, and for a long moment they\nremained suspended on each other's stare.\n\nUndine at length shrank back with an unrecognizing face; but her\nmovement made her opera-glass slip to the floor, and her neighbour bent\ndown and picked it up.\n\n\"Well--don't you know me yet?\" he said with a slight smile, as he\nrestored the glass to her.\n\nShe had grown white to the lips, and when she tried to speak the effort\nproduced only a faint click in her throat. She felt that the change in\nher appearance must be visible, and the dread of letting Marvell see it\nmade her continue to turn her ravaged face to her other neighbour.\nThe round black eyes set prominently in the latter's round glossy\ncountenance had expressed at first only an impersonal and slightly\nironic interest; but a look of surprise grew in them as Undine's silence\ncontinued.\n\n\"What's the matter? Don't you want me to speak to you?\"\n\nShe became aware that Marvell, as if unconscious of her slight show of\ndispleasure, had left his seat, and was making his way toward the aisle;\nand this assertion of independence, which a moment before she would so\ndeeply have resented, now gave her a feeling of intense relief.\n\n\"No--don't speak to me, please. I'll tell you another time--I'll\nwrite.\" Her neighbour continued to gaze at her, forming his lips into a\nnoiseless whistle under his small dark moustache.\n\n\"Well, I--That's about the stiffest,\" he murmured; and as she made no\nanswer he added: \"Afraid I'll ask to be introduced to your friend?\"\n\nShe made a faint movement of entreaty. \"I can't explain. I promise to\nsee you; but I ASK you not to talk to me now.\"\n\nHe unfolded his programme, and went on speaking in a low tone while he\naffected to study it. \"Anything to oblige, of course. That's always been\nmy motto. But is it a bargain--fair and square? You'll see me?\"\n\nShe receded farther from him. \"I promise. I--I WANT to,\" she faltered.\n\n\"All right, then. Call me up in the morning at the Driscoll Building.\nSeven-o-nine--got it?\"\n\nShe nodded, and he added in a still lower tone: \"I suppose I can\ncongratulate you, anyhow?\" and then, without waiting for her reply,\nturned to study Mrs. Van Degen's box through his opera-glass. Clare, as\nif aware of the scrutiny fixed on her from below leaned back and threw a\nquestion over her shoulder to Ralph Marvell, who had just seated himself\nbehind her.\n\n\"Who's the funny man with the red face talking to Miss Spragg?\"\n\nRalph bent forward. \"The man next to her? Never saw him before. But I\nthink you're mistaken: she's not speaking to him.\"\n\n\"She WAS--Wasn't she, Harriet?\"\n\nMiss Ray pinched her lips together without speaking, and Mrs. Van Degen\npaused for the fraction of a second. \"Perhaps he's an Apex friend,\" she\nthen suggested.\n\n\"Very likely. Only I think she'd have introduced him if he had been.\"\n\nHis cousin faintly shrugged. \"Shall you encourage that?\"\n\nPeter Van Degen, who had strayed into his wife's box for a moment,\ncaught the colloquy, and lifted his opera-glass.\n\n\"The fellow next to Miss Spragg? (By George, Ralph, she's ripping\nto-night!) Wait a minute--I know his face. Saw him in old Harmon\nDriscoll's office the day of the Eubaw Mine meeting. This chap's his\nsecretary, or something. Driscoll called him in to give some facts to\nthe directors, and he seemed a mighty wide-awake customer.\"\n\nClare Van Degen turned gaily to her cousin. \"If he has anything to\ndo with the Driscolls you'd better cultivate him! That's the kind of\nacquaintance the Dagonets have always needed. I married to set them an\nexample!\"\n\nRalph rose with a laugh. \"You're right. I'll hurry back and make\nhis acquaintance.\" He held out his hand to his cousin, avoiding her\ndisappointed eyes.\n\nUndine, on entering her bedroom late that evening, was startled by the\npresence of a muffled figure which revealed itself, through the dimness,\nas the ungirded midnight outline of Mrs. Spragg.\n\n\"MOTHER? What on earth--?\" the girl exclaimed, as Mrs. Spragg pressed\nthe electric button and flooded the room with light. The idea of a\nmother's sitting up for her daughter was so foreign to Apex customs\nthat it roused only mistrust and irritation in the object of the\ndemonstration.\n\nMrs. Spragg came forward deprecatingly to lift the cloak from her\ndaughter's shoulders.\n\n\"I just HAD to, Undie--I told father I HAD to. I wanted to hear all\nabout it.\"\n\nUndine shrugged away from her. \"Mercy! At this hour? You'll be as white\nas a sheet to-morrow, sitting up all night like this.\"\n\nShe moved toward the toilet-table, and began to demolish with feverish\nhands the structure which Mrs. Heeny, a few hours earlier, had so\nlovingly raised. But the rose caught in a mesh of hair, and Mrs. Spragg,\nventuring timidly to release it, had a full view of her daughter's face\nin the glass.\n\n\"Why, Undie, YOU'RE as white as a sheet now! You look fairly sick.\nWhat's the matter, daughter?\"\n\nThe girl broke away from her.\n\n\"Oh, can't you leave me alone, mother? There--do I look white NOW?\" she\ncried, the blood flaming into her pale cheeks; and as Mrs. Spragg\nshrank back, she added more mildly, in the tone of a parent rebuking a\npersistent child: \"It's enough to MAKE anybody sick to be stared at that\nway!\"\n\nMrs. Spragg overflowed with compunction. \"I'm so sorry, Undie. I guess\nit was just seeing you in this glare of light.\"\n\n\"Yes--the light's awful; do turn some off,\" ordered Undine, for whom,\nordinarily, no radiance was too strong; and Mrs. Spragg, grateful to\nhave commands laid upon her, hastened to obey.\n\nUndine, after this, submitted in brooding silence to having her dress\nunlaced, and her slippers and dressing-gown brought to her. Mrs. Spragg\nvisibly yearned to say more, but she restrained the impulse lest it\nshould provoke her dismissal.\n\n\"Won't you take just a sup of milk before you go to bed?\" she suggested\nat length, as Undine sank into an armchair.\n\n\"I've got some for you right here in the parlour.\"\n\nWithout looking up the girl answered: \"No. I don't want anything. Do go\nto bed.\"\n\nHer mother seemed to be struggling between the life-long instinct\nof obedience and a swift unformulated fear. \"I'm going, Undie.\" She\nwavered. \"Didn't they receive you right, daughter?\" she asked with\nsudden resolution.\n\n\"What nonsense! How should they receive me? Everybody was lovely to me.\"\nUndine rose to her feet and went on with her undressing, tossing her\nclothes on the floor and shaking her hair over her bare shoulders.\n\nMrs. Spragg stooped to gather up the scattered garments as they fell,\nfolding them with a wistful caressing touch, and laying them on the\nlounge, without daring to raise her eyes to her daughter. It was not\ntill she heard Undine throw herself on the bed that she went toward her\nand drew the coverlet up with deprecating hands.\n\n\"Oh, do put the light out--I'm dead tired,\" the girl grumbled, pressing\nher face into the pillow.\n\nMrs. Spragg turned away obediently; then, gathering all her scattered\nimpulses into a passionate act of courage, she moved back to the\nbedside.\n\n\"Undie--you didn't see anybody--I mean at the theatre? ANYBODY YOU\nDIDN'T WANT TO SEE?\"\n\nUndine, at the question, raised her head and started right against\nthe tossed pillows, her white exasperated face close to her mother's\ntwitching features. The two women examined each other a moment, fear\nand anger in their crossed glances; then Undine answered: \"No, nobody.\nGood-night.\"\n\n\n\nIX\n\nUndine, late the next day, waited alone under the leafless trellising of\na wistaria arbour on the west side of the Central Park. She had put on\nher plainest dress, and wound a closely, patterned veil over her least\nvivid hat; but even thus toned down to the situation she was conscious\nof blazing out from it inconveniently.\n\nThe habit of meeting young men in sequestered spots was not unknown to\nher: the novelty was in feeling any embarrassment about it. Even now\nshe--was disturbed not so much by the unlikely chance of an accidental\nencounter with Ralph Marvell as by the remembrance of similar meetings,\nfar from accidental, with the romantic Aaronson. Could it be that the\nhand now adorned with Ralph's engagement ring had once, in this very\nspot, surrendered itself to the riding-master's pressure? At the thought\na wave of physical disgust passed over her, blotting out another memory\nas distasteful but more remote.\n\nIt was revived by the appearance of a ruddy middle-sized young man, his\nstoutish figure tightly buttoned into a square-shouldered over-coat, who\npresently approached along the path that led to the arbour. Silhouetted\nagainst the slope of the asphalt, the newcomer revealed an outline thick\nyet compact, with a round head set on a neck in which, at the first\nchance, prosperity would be likely to develop a red crease. His face,\nwith its rounded surfaces, and the sanguine innocence of a complexion\nbelied by prematurely astute black eyes, had a look of jovial cunning\nwhich Undine had formerly thought \"smart\" but which now struck her as\nmerely vulgar. She felt that in the Marvell set Elmer Moffatt would have\nbeen stamped as \"not a gentleman.\" Nevertheless something in his look\nseemed to promise the capacity to develop into any character he might\ncare to assume; though it did not seem probable that, for the present,\nthat of a gentleman would be among them. He had always had a brisk\nswaggering step, and the faintly impudent tilt of the head that she had\nonce thought \"dashing\"; but whereas this look had formerly denoted\na somewhat desperate defiance of the world and its judgments it now\nsuggested an almost assured relation to these powers; and Undine's heart\nsank at the thought of what the change implied.\n\nAs he drew nearer, the young man's air of assurance was replaced by an\nexpression of mildly humorous surprise.\n\n\"Well--this is white of you. Undine!\" he said, taking her lifeless\nfingers into his dapperly gloved hand.\n\nThrough her veil she formed the words: \"I said I'd come.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"That's so. And you see I believed you. Though I might not\nhave--\"\n\n\"I don't see the use of beginning like this,\" she interrupted nervously.\n\n\"That's so too. Suppose we walk along a little ways? It's rather chilly\nstanding round.\"\n\nHe turned down the path that descended toward the Ramble and the girl\nmoved on beside him with her long flowing steps.\n\nWhen they had reached the comparative shelter of the interlacing trees\nMoffatt paused again to say: \"If we're going to talk I'd like to see\nyou. Undine;\" and after a first moment of reluctance she submissively\nthrew back her veil.\n\nHe let his eyes rest on her in silence; then he said judicially: \"You've\nfilled out some; but you're paler.\" After another appreciative scrutiny\nhe added: \"There's mighty few women as well worth looking at, and I'm\nobliged to you for letting me have the chance again.\"\n\nUndine's brows drew together, but she softened her frown to a quivering\nsmile.\n\n\"I'm glad to see you too, Elmer--I am, REALLY!\"\n\nHe returned her smile while his glance continued to study her\nhumorously. \"You didn't betray the fact last night. Miss Spragg.\"\n\n\"I was so taken aback. I thought you were out in Alaska somewhere.\"\n\nThe young man shaped his lips into the mute whistle by which he\nhabitually vented his surprise. \"You DID? Didn't Abner E. Spragg tell\nyou he'd seen me down town?\"\n\nUndine gave him a startled glance. \"Father? Why, have you seen him? He\nnever said a word about it!\"\n\nHer companion's whistle became audible. \"He's running yet!\" he said\ngaily. \"I wish I could scare some people as easy as I can your father.\"\n\nThe girl hesitated. \"I never felt toward you the way father did,\" she\nhazarded at length; and he gave her another long look in return.\n\n\"Well, if they'd left you alone I don't believe you'd ever have acted\nmean to me,\" was the conclusion he drew from it.\n\n\"I didn't mean to, Elmer ... I give you my word--but I was so young ...\nI didn't know anything....\"\n\nHis eyes had a twinkle of reminiscent pleasantry. \"No--I don't suppose\nit WOULD teach a girl much to be engaged two years to a stiff like\nMillard Binch; and that was about all that had happened to you before I\ncame along.\"\n\nUndine flushed to the forehead. \"Oh, Elmer--I was only a child when I\nwas engaged to Millard--\"\n\n\"That's a fact. And you went on being one a good while afterward. The\nApex Eagle always head-lined you 'The child-bride'--\"\n\n\"I can't see what's the use--now--.\"\n\n\"That ruled out of court too? See here. Undine--what CAN we talk about?\nI understood that was what we were here for.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" She made an effort at recovery. \"I only meant to\nsay--what's the use of raking up things that are over?\"\n\n\"Rake up? That's the idea, is it? Was that why you tried to cut me last\nnight?\"\n\n\"I--oh, Elmer! I didn't mean to; only, you see, I'm engaged.\"\n\n\"Oh, I saw that fast enough. I'd have seen it even if I didn't read the\npapers.\" He gave a short laugh. \"He was feeling pretty good, sitting\nthere alongside of you, wasn't he? I don't wonder he was. I remember.\nBut I don't see that that was a reason for cold-shouldering me. I'm\na respectable member of society now--I'm one of Harmon B. Driscoll's\nprivate secretaries.\" He brought out the fact with mock solemnity.\n\nBut to Undine, though undoubtedly impressive, the statement did not\nimmediately present itself as a subject for pleasantry.\n\n\"Elmer Moffatt--you ARE?\"\n\nHe laughed again. \"Guess you'd have remembered me last night if you'd\nknown it.\"\n\nShe was following her own train of thought with a look of pale\nintensity. \"You're LIVING in New York, then--you're going to live here\nright along?\"\n\n\"Well, it looks that way; as long as I can hang on to this job. Great\nmen always gravitate to the metropolis. And I gravitated here just as\nUncle Harmon B. was looking round for somebody who could give him an\ninside tip on the Eubaw mine deal--you know the Driscolls are\npretty deep in Eubaw. I happened to go out there after our little\nunpleasantness at Apex, and it was just the time the deal went through.\nSo in one way your folks did me a good turn when they made Apex too hot\nfor me: funny to think of, ain't it?\"\n\nUndine, recovering herself, held out her hand impulsively.\n\n\"I'm real glad of it--I mean I'm real glad you've had such a stroke of\nluck!\"\n\n\"Much obliged,\" he returned. \"By the way, you might mention the fact to\nAbner E. Spragg next time you run across him.\"\n\n\"Father'll be real glad too, Elmer.\" She hesitated, and then went on:\n\"You must see now that it was natural father and mother should have felt\nthe way they did--\"\n\n\"Oh, the only thing that struck me as unnatural was their making you\nfeel so too. But I'm free to admit I wasn't a promising case in those\ndays.\" His glance played over her for a moment. \"Say, Undine--it was\ngood while it lasted, though, wasn't it?\"\n\nShe shrank back with a burning face and eyes of misery.\n\n\"Why, what's the matter? That ruled out too? Oh, all right. Look at\nhere, Undine, suppose you let me know what you ARE here to talk about,\nanyhow.\"\n\nShe cast a helpless glance down the windings of the wooded glen in which\nthey had halted.\n\n\"Just to ask you--to beg you--not to say anything of this kind\nagain--EVER--\"\n\n\"Anything about you and me?\"\n\nShe nodded mutely.\n\n\"Why, what's wrong? Anybody been saying anything against me?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. It's not that!\"\n\n\"What on earth is it, then--except that you're ashamed of me, one way\nor another?\" She made no answer, and he stood digging the tip of his\nwalking-stick into a fissure of the asphalt. At length he went on in\na tone that showed a first faint trace of irritation: \"I don't want to\nbreak into your gilt-edged crowd, if it's that you're scared of.\"\n\nHis tone seemed to increase her distress. \"No, no--you don't understand.\nAll I want is that nothing shall be known.\"\n\n\"Yes; but WHY? It was all straight enough, if you come to that.\"\n\n\"It doesn't matter ... whether it was straight ... or ... not ...\" He\ninterpolated a whistle which made her add: \"What I mean is that out here\nin the East they don't even like it if a girl's been ENGAGED before.\"\n\nThis last strain on his credulity wrung a laugh from Moffatt. \"Gee!\nHow'd they expect her fair young life to pass? Playing 'Holy City' on\nthe melodeon, and knitting tidies for church fairs?\"\n\n\"Girls are looked after here. It's all different. Their mothers go round\nwith them.\"\n\nThis increased her companion's hilarity and he glanced about him with a\npretense of compunction. \"Excuse ME! I ought to have remembered. Where's\nyour chaperon, Miss Spragg?\" He crooked his arm with mock ceremony.\n\"Allow me to escort you to the bew-fay. You see I'm onto the New York\nstyle myself.\"\n\nA sigh of discouragement escaped her. \"Elmer--if you really believe I\nnever wanted to act mean to you, don't you act mean to me now!\"\n\n\"Act mean?\" He grew serious again and moved nearer to her. \"What is it\nyou want, Undine? Why can't you say it right out?\"\n\n\"What I told you. I don't want Ralph Marvell--or any of them--to know\nanything. If any of his folks found out, they'd never let him marry\nme--never! And he wouldn't want to: he'd be so horrified. And it would\nKILL me, Elmer--it would just kill me!\"\n\nShe pressed close to him, forgetful of her new reserves and repugnances,\nand impelled by the passionate absorbing desire to wring from him some\ndefinite pledge of safety.\n\n\"Oh, Elmer, if you ever liked me, help me now, and I'll help you if I\nget the chance!\"\n\nHe had recovered his coolness as hers forsook her, and stood his ground\nsteadily, though her entreating hands, her glowing face, were near\nenough to have shaken less sturdy nerves.\n\n\"That so, Puss? You just ask me to pass the sponge over Elmer Moffatt of\nApex City? Cut the gentleman when we meet? That the size of it?\"\n\n\"Oh, Elmer, it's my first chance--I can't lose it!\" she broke out,\nsobbing.\n\n\"Nonsense, child! Of course you shan't. Here, look up. Undine--why, I\nnever saw you cry before. Don't you be afraid of me--_I_ ain't going to\ninterrupt the wedding march.\" He began to whistle a bar of Lohengrin. \"I\nonly just want one little promise in return.\"\n\nShe threw a startled look at him and he added reassuringly: \"Oh, don't\nmistake me. I don't want to butt into your set--not for social purposes,\nanyhow; but if ever it should come handy to know any of 'em in a\nbusiness way, would you fix it up for me--AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED?'\"\n\nTheir eyes met, and she remained silent for a tremulous moment or two;\nthen she held out her hand. \"Afterward--yes. I promise. And YOU promise,\nElmer?\"\n\n\"Oh, to have and to hold!\" he sang out, swinging about to follow her as\nshe hurriedly began to retrace her steps.\n\nThe March twilight had fallen, and the Stentorian facade was all aglow,\nwhen Undine regained its monumental threshold. She slipped through the\nmarble vestibule and soared skyward in the mirror-lined lift, hardly\nconscious of the direction she was taking. What she wanted was solitude,\nand the time to put some order into her thoughts; and she hoped to steal\ninto her room without meeting her mother. Through her thick veil\nthe clusters of lights in the Spragg drawing-room dilated and flowed\ntogether in a yellow blur, from which, as she entered, a figure detached\nitself; and with a start of annoyance she saw Ralph Marvell rise from\nthe perusal of the \"fiction number\" of a magazine which had replaced\n\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\" on the onyx table.\n\n\"Yes; you told me not to come--and here I am.\" He lifted her hand to his\nlips as his eyes tried to find hers through the veil.\n\nShe drew back with a nervous gesture. \"I told you I'd be awfully late.\"\n\n\"I know--trying on! And you're horribly tired, and wishing with all your\nmight I wasn't here.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure I'm not!\" she rejoined, trying to hide her vexation in\na smile.\n\n\"What a tragic little voice! You really are done up. I couldn't help\ndropping in for a minute; but of course if you say so I'll be off.\" She\nwas removing her long gloves and he took her hands and drew her close.\n\"Only take off your veil, and let me see you.\"\n\nA quiver of resistance ran through her: he felt it and dropped her\nhands.\n\n\"Please don't tease. I never could bear it,\" she stammered, drawing\naway.\n\n\"Till to-morrow, then; that is, if the dress-makers permit.\"\n\nShe forced a laugh. \"If I showed myself now you might not come back\nto-morrow. I look perfectly hideous--it was so hot and they kept me so\nlong.\"\n\n\"All to make yourself more beautiful for a man who's blind with your\nbeauty already?\"\n\nThe words made her smile, and moving nearer she bent her head and stood\nstill while he undid her veil. As he put it back their lips met, and his\nlook of passionate tenderness was incense to her.\n\nBut the next moment his expression passed from worship to concern.\n\"Dear! Why, what's the matter? You've been crying!\"\n\nShe put both hands to her hat in the instinctive effort to hide her\nface. His persistence was as irritating as her mother's.\n\n\"I told you it was frightfully hot--and all my things were horrid; and\nit made me so cross and nervous!\" She turned to the looking-glass with a\nfeint of smoothing her hair.\n\nMarvell laid his hand on her arm, \"I can't bear to see you so done\nup. Why can't we be married to-morrow, and escape all these ridiculous\npreparations? I shall hate your fine clothes if they're going to make\nyou so miserable.\"\n\nShe dropped her hands, and swept about on him, her face lit up by a new\nidea. He was extraordinarily handsome and appealing, and her heart began\nto beat faster.\n\n\"I hate it all too! I wish we COULD be married right away!\"\n\nMarvell caught her to him joyously. \"Dearest--dearest! Don't, if you\ndon't mean it! The thought's too glorious!\"\n\nUndine lingered in his arms, not with any intent of tenderness, but\nas if too deeply lost in a new train of thought to be conscious of his\nhold.\n\n\"I suppose most of the things COULD be got ready sooner--if I said they\nMUST,\" she brooded, with a fixed gaze that travelled past him. \"And the\nrest--why shouldn't the rest be sent over to Europe after us? I want to\ngo straight off with you, away from everything--ever so far away,\nwhere there'll be nobody but you and me alone!\" She had a flash of\nillumination which made her turn her lips to his.\n\n\"Oh, my darling--my darling!\" Marvell whispered.\n\n\n\nX\n\nMr. and Mrs. Spragg were both given to such long periods of ruminating\napathy that the student of inheritance might have wondered whence Undine\nderived her overflowing activity. The answer would have been obtained\nby observing her father's business life. From the moment he set foot\nin Wall Street Mr. Spragg became another man. Physically the change\nrevealed itself only by the subtlest signs. As he steered his way to his\noffice through the jostling crowd of William Street his relaxed\nmuscles did not grow more taut or his lounging gait less desultory.\nHis shoulders were hollowed by the usual droop, and his rusty black\nwaistcoat showed the same creased concavity at the waist, the same\nflabby prominence below. It was only in his face that the difference was\nperceptible, though even here it rather lurked behind the features than\nopenly modified them: showing itself now and then in the cautious glint\nof half-closed eyes, the forward thrust of black brows, or a tightening\nof the lax lines of the mouth--as the gleam of a night-watchman's light\nmight flash across the darkness of a shuttered house-front. The shutters\nwere more tightly barred than usual, when, on a morning some two\nweeks later than the date of the incidents last recorded, Mr. Spragg\napproached the steel and concrete tower in which his office occupied a\nlofty pigeon-hole. Events had moved rapidly and somewhat surprisingly in\nthe interval, and Mr. Spragg had already accustomed himself to the fact\nthat his daughter was to be married within the week, instead of awaiting\nthe traditional post-Lenten date. Conventionally the change meant little\nto him; but on the practical side it presented unforeseen difficulties.\nMr. Spragg had learned within the last weeks that a New York marriage\ninvolved material obligations unknown to Apex. Marvell, indeed, had\nbeen loftily careless of such questions; but his grandfather, on the\nannouncement of the engagement, had called on Mr. Spragg and put before\nhim, with polished precision, the young man's financial situation.\n\nMr. Spragg, at the moment, had been inclined to deal with his visitor in\na spirit of indulgent irony. As he leaned back in his revolving chair,\nwith feet adroitly balanced against a tilted scrap basket, his air of\nrelaxed power made Mr. Dagonet's venerable elegance seem as harmless as\nthat of an ivory jack-straw--and his first replies to his visitor were\nmade with the mildness of a kindly giant.\n\n\"Ralph don't make a living out of the law, you say? No, it didn't strike\nme he'd be likely to, from the talks I've had with him. Fact is, the\nlaw's a business that wants--\" Mr. Spragg broke off, checked by a\nprotest from Mr. Dagonet. \"Oh, a PROFESSION, you call it? It ain't\na business?\" His smile grew more indulgent as this novel distinction\ndawned on him. \"Why, I guess that's the whole trouble with Ralph. Nobody\nexpects to make money in a PROFESSION; and if you've taught him to\nregard the law that way, he'd better go right into cooking-stoves and\ndone with it.\"\n\nMr. Dagonet, within a narrower range, had his own play of humour; and\nit met Mr. Spragg's with a leap. \"It's because I knew he would manage to\nmake cooking-stoves as unremunerative as a profession that I saved him\nfrom so glaring a failure by putting him into the law.\"\n\nThe retort drew a grunt of amusement from Mr. Spragg; and the eyes of\nthe two men met in unexpected understanding.\n\n\"That so? What can he do, then?\" the future father-in-law enquired.\n\n\"He can write poetry--at least he tells me he can.\" Mr. Dagonet\nhesitated, as if aware of the inadequacy of the alternative, and then\nadded: \"And he can count on three thousand a year from me.\"\n\nMr. Spragg tilted himself farther back without disturbing his\nsubtly-calculated relation to the scrap basket.\n\n\"Does it cost anything like that to print his poetry?\"\n\nMr. Dagonet smiled again: he was clearly enjoying his visit. \"Dear,\nno--he doesn't go in for 'luxe' editions. And now and then he gets ten\ndollars from a magazine.\"\n\nMr. Spragg mused. \"Wasn't he ever TAUGHT to work?\"\n\n\"No; I really couldn't have afforded that.\"\n\n\"I see. Then they've got to live on two hundred and fifty dollars a\nmonth.\"\n\nMr. Dagonet remained pleasantly unmoved. \"Does it cost anything like\nthat to buy your daughter's dresses?\"\n\nA subterranean chuckle agitated the lower folds of Mr. Spragg's\nwaistcoat.\n\n\"I might put him in the way of something--I guess he's smart enough.\"\n\nMr. Dagonet made a gesture of friendly warning. \"It will pay us both in\nthe end to keep him out of business,\" he said, rising as if to show that\nhis mission was accomplished.\n\nThe results of this friendly conference had been more serious than\nMr. Spragg could have foreseen--and the victory remained with his\nantagonist. It had not entered into Mr. Spragg's calculations that he\nwould have to give his daughter any fixed income on her marriage. He\nmeant that she should have the \"handsomest\" wedding the New York press\nhad ever celebrated, and her mother's fancy was already afloat on a\nsea of luxuries--a motor, a Fifth Avenue house, and a tiara that should\nout-blaze Mrs. Van Degen's; but these were movable benefits, to be\nconferred whenever Mr. Spragg happened to be \"on the right side\" of the\nmarket. It was a different matter to be called on, at such short\nnotice, to bridge the gap between young Marvell's allowance and Undine's\nrequirements; and her father's immediate conclusion was that the\nengagement had better be broken off. Such scissions were almost painless\nin Apex, and he had fancied it would be easy, by an appeal to the girl's\npride, to make her see that she owed it to herself to do better.\n\n\"You'd better wait awhile and look round again,\" was the way he had put\nit to her at the opening of the talk of which, even now, he could not\nrecall the close without a tremor.\n\nUndine, when she took his meaning, had been terrible. Everything had\ngone down before her, as towns and villages went down before one of the\ntornadoes of her native state. Wait awhile? Look round? Did he suppose\nshe was marrying for MONEY? Didn't he see it was all a question, now\nand here, of the kind of people she wanted to \"go with\"? Did he want\nto throw her straight back into the Lipscomb set, to have her marry a\ndentist and live in a West Side flat? Why hadn't they stayed in Apex, if\nthat was all he thought she was fit for? She might as well have married\nMillard Binch, instead of handing him over to Indiana Frusk! Couldn't\nher father understand that nice girls, in New York, didn't regard\ngetting married like going on a buggy-ride? It was enough to ruin a\ngirl's chances if she broke her engagement to a man in Ralph Marvell's\nset. All kinds of spiteful things would be said about her, and she would\nnever be able to go with the right people again. They had better go back\nto Apex right off--it was they and not SHE who had wanted to leave Apex,\nanyhow--she could call her mother to witness it. She had always, when it\ncame to that, done what her father and mother wanted, but she'd given\nup trying to make out what they were after, unless it was to make her\nmiserable; and if that was it, hadn't they had enough of it by this\ntime? She had, anyhow. But after this she meant to lead her own life;\nand they needn't ask her where she was going, or what she meant to do,\nbecause this time she'd die before she told them--and they'd made life\nso hateful to her that she only wished she was dead already.\n\nMr. Spragg heard her out in silence, pulling at his beard with one\nsallow wrinkled hand, while the other dragged down the armhole of his\nwaistcoat. Suddenly he looked up and said: \"Ain't you in love with the\nfellow, Undie?\"\n\nThe girl glared back at him, her splendid brows beetling like an\nAmazon's. \"Do you think I'd care a cent for all the rest of it if I\nwasn't?\"\n\n\"Well, if you are, you and he won't mind beginning in a small way.\"\n\nHer look poured contempt on his ignorance. \"Do you s'pose I'd drag\nhim down?\" With a magnificent gesture she tore Marvell's ring from her\nfinger. \"I'll send this back this minute. I'll tell him I thought he\nwas a rich man, and now I see I'm mistaken--\" She burst into shattering\nsobs, rocking her beautiful body back and forward in all the abandonment\nof young grief; and her father stood over her, stroking her shoulder and\nsaying helplessly: \"I'll see what I can do, Undine--\"\n\nAll his life, and at ever-diminishing intervals, Mr. Spragg had been\ncalled on by his womenkind to \"see what he could do\"; and the seeing had\nalmost always resulted as they wished. Undine did not have to send back\nher ring, and in her state of trance-like happiness she hardly asked by\nwhat means her path had been smoothed, but merely accepted her mother's\nassurance that \"father had fixed everything all right.\"\n\nMr. Spragg accepted the situation also. A son-in-law who expected to\nbe pensioned like a Grand Army veteran was a phenomenon new to his\nexperience; but if that was what Undine wanted she should have it. Only\ntwo days later, however, he was met by a new demand--the young people\nhad decided to be married \"right off,\" instead of waiting till June.\nThis change of plan was made known to Mr. Spragg at a moment when he was\npeculiarly unprepared for the financial readjustment it necessitated. He\nhad always declared himself able to cope with any crisis if Undine and\nher mother would \"go steady\"; but he now warned them of his inability to\nkeep up with the new pace they had set. Undine, not deigning to return\nto the charge, had commissioned her mother to speak for her; and Mr.\nSpragg was surprised to meet in his wife a firmness as inflexible as his\ndaughter's.\n\n\"I can't do it, Loot--can't put my hand on the cash,\" he had protested;\nbut Mrs. Spragg fought him inch by inch, her back to the wall--flinging\nout at last, as he pressed her closer: \"Well, if you want to know, she's\nseen Elmer.\"\n\nThe bolt reached its mark, and her husband turned an agitated face on\nher.\n\n\"Elmer? What on earth--he didn't come HERE?\"\n\n\"No; but he sat next to her the other night at the theatre, and she's\nwild with us for not having warned her.\"\n\nMr. Spragg's scowl drew his projecting brows together. \"Warned her of\nwhat? What's Elmer to her? Why's she afraid of Elmer Moffatt?\"\n\n\"She's afraid of his talking.\"\n\n\"Talking? What on earth can he say that'll hurt HER?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" Mrs. Spragg wailed. \"She's so nervous I can hardly\nget a word out of her.\"\n\nMr. Spragg's whitening face showed the touch of a new fear. \"Is she\nafraid he'll get round her again--make up to her? Is that what she\nmeans by 'talking'?\" \"I don't know, I don't know. I only know she is\nafraid--she's afraid as death of him.\"\n\nFor a long interval they sat silently looking at each other while their\nheavy eyes exchanged conjectures: then Mr. Spragg rose from his chair,\nsaying, as he took up his hat: \"Don't you fret, Leota; I'll see what I\ncan do.\"\n\nHe had been \"seeing\" now for an arduous fortnight; and the strain on his\nvision had resulted in a state of tension such as he had not undergone\nsince the epic days of the Pure Water Move at Apex. It was not his habit\nto impart his fears to Mrs. Spragg and Undine, and they continued the\nbridal preparations, secure in their invariable experience that, once\n\"father\" had been convinced of the impossibility of evading their\ndemands, he might be trusted to satisfy them by means with which his\nwomenkind need not concern themselves. Mr. Spragg, as he approached his\noffice on the morning in question, felt reasonably sure of fulfilling\nthese expectations; but he reflected that a few more such victories\nwould mean disaster.\n\nHe entered the vast marble vestibule of the Ararat Trust Building and\nwalked toward the express elevator that was to carry him up to his\noffice. At the door of the elevator a man turned to him, and he\nrecognized Elmer Moffatt, who put out his hand with an easy gesture.\n\nMr. Spragg did not ignore the gesture: he did not even withhold his\nhand. In his code the cut, as a conscious sign of disapproval, did not\nexist. In the south, if you had a grudge against a man you tried to\nshoot him; in the west, you tried to do him in a mean turn in business;\nbut in neither region was the cut among the social weapons of offense.\nMr. Spragg, therefore, seeing Moffatt in his path, extended a lifeless\nhand while he faced the young man scowlingly. Moffatt met the hand and\nthe scowl with equal coolness.\n\n\"Going up to your office? I was on my way there.\"\n\nThe elevator door rolled back, and Mr. Spragg, entering it, found his\ncompanion at his side. They remained silent during the ascent to Mr.\nSpragg's threshold; but there the latter turned to enquire ironically of\nMoffatt: \"Anything left to say?\"\n\nMoffatt smiled. \"Nothing LEFT--no; I'm carrying a whole new line of\ngoods.\"\n\nMr. Spragg pondered the reply; then he opened the door and suffered\nMoffatt to follow him in. Behind an inner glazed enclosure, with its\none window dimmed by a sooty perspective barred with chimneys, he seated\nhimself at a dusty littered desk, and groped instinctively for the\nsupport of the scrap basket. Moffatt, uninvited, dropped into the\nnearest chair, and Mr. Spragg said, after another silence: \"I'm pretty\nbusy this morning.\"\n\n\"I know you are: that's why I'm here,\" Moffatt serenely answered. He\nleaned back, crossing his legs, and twisting his small stiff moustache\nwith a plump hand adorned by a cameo.\n\n\"Fact is,\" he went on, \"this is a coals-of-fire call. You think I owe\nyou a grudge, and I'm going to show you I'm not that kind. I'm going\nto put you onto a good thing--oh, not because I'm so fond of you; just\nbecause it happens to hit my sense of a joke.\"\n\nWhile Moffatt talked Mr. Spragg took up the pile of letters on his desk\nand sat shuffling them like a pack of cards. He dealt them deliberately\nto two imaginary players; then he pushed them aside and drew out his\nwatch.\n\n\"All right--I carry one too,\" said the young man easily. \"But you'll\nfind it's time gained to hear what I've got to say.\"\n\nMr. Spragg considered the vista of chimneys without speaking, and\nMoffatt continued: \"I don't suppose you care to hear the story of my\nlife, so I won't refer you to the back numbers. You used to say out\nin Apex that I spent too much time loafing round the bar of the Mealey\nHouse; that was one of the things you had against me. Well, maybe I\ndid--but it taught me to talk, and to listen to the other fellows too.\nJust at present I'm one of Harmon B. Driscoll's private secretaries, and\nsome of that Mealey House loafing has come in more useful than any job I\never put my hand to. The old man happened to hear I knew something about\nthe inside of the Eubaw deal, and took me on to have the information\nwhere he could get at it. I've given him good talk for his money;\nbut I've done some listening too. Eubaw ain't the only commodity the\nDriscolls deal in.\"\n\nMr. Spragg restored his watch to his pocket and shifted his drowsy gaze\nfrom the window to his visitor's face.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Moffatt, as if in reply to the movement, \"the Driscolls are\ngetting busy out in Apex. Now they've got all the street railroads in\ntheir pocket they want the water-supply too--but you know that as well\nas I do. Fact is, they've got to have it; and there's where you and I\ncome in.\"\n\nMr. Spragg thrust his hands in his waistcoat arm-holes and turned his\neyes back to the window.\n\n\"I'm out of that long ago,\" he said indifferently.\n\n\"Sure,\" Moffatt acquiesced; \"but you know what went on when you were in\nit.\"\n\n\"Well?\" said Mr. Spragg, shifting one hand to the Masonic emblem on his\nwatch-chain.\n\n\"Well, Representative James J. Rolliver, who was in it with you, ain't\nout of it yet. He's the man the Driscolls are up against. What d'you\nknow about him?\"\n\nMr. Spragg twirled the emblem thoughtfully. \"Driscoll tell you to come\nhere?\"\n\nMoffatt laughed. \"No, SIR--not by a good many miles.\"\n\nMr. Spragg removed his feet from the scrap basket and straightened\nhimself in his chair.\n\n\"Well--I didn't either; good morning, Mr. Moffatt.\"\n\nThe young man stared a moment, a humorous glint in his small black eyes;\nbut he made no motion to leave his seat. \"Undine's to be married next\nweek, isn't she?\" he asked in a conversational tone.\n\nMr. Spragg's face blackened and he swung about in his revolving chair.\n\n\"You go to--\"\n\nMoffatt raised a deprecating hand. \"Oh, you needn't warn me off. I\ndon't want to be invited to the wedding. And I don't want to forbid the\nbanns.\"\n\nThere was a derisive sound in Mr. Spragg's throat.\n\n\"But I DO want to get out of Driscoll's office,\" Moffatt imperturbably\ncontinued. \"There's no future there for a fellow like me. I see things\nbig. That's the reason Apex was too tight a fit for me. It's only\nthe little fellows that succeed in little places. New York's my\nsize--without a single alteration. I could prove it to you to-morrow if\nI could put my hand on fifty thousand dollars.\"\n\nMr. Spragg did not repeat his gesture of dismissal: he was once more\nlistening guardedly but intently. Moffatt saw it and continued.\n\n\"And I could put my hand on double that sum--yes, sir, DOUBLE--if you'd\njust step round with me to old Driscoll's office before five P. M. See\nthe connection, Mr. Spragg?\"\n\nThe older man remained silent while his visitor hummed a bar or two of\n\"In the Gloaming\"; then he said: \"You want me to tell Driscoll what I\nknow about James J. Rolliver?\"\n\n\"I want you to tell the truth--I want you to stand for political purity\nin your native state. A man of your prominence owes it to the community,\nsir,\" cried Moffatt. Mr. Spragg was still tormenting his Masonic emblem.\n\n\"Rolliver and I always stood together,\" he said at last, with a tinge of\nreluctance.\n\n\"Well, how much have you made out of it? Ain't he always been ahead of\nthe game?\"\n\n\"I can't do it--I can't do it,\" said Mr. Spragg, bringing his clenched\nhand down on the desk, as if addressing an invisible throng of\nassailants.\n\nMoffatt rose without any evidence of disappointment in his ruddy\ncountenance. \"Well, so long,\" he said, moving toward the door. Near\nthe threshold he paused to add carelessly: \"Excuse my referring to a\npersonal matter--but I understand Miss Spragg's wedding takes place next\nMonday.\"\n\nMr. Spragg was silent.\n\n\"How's that?\" Moffatt continued unabashed. \"I saw in the papers the date\nwas set for the end of June.\"\n\nMr. Spragg rose heavily from his seat. \"I presume my daughter has her\nreasons,\" he said, moving toward the door in Moffatt's wake.\n\n\"I guess she has--same as I have for wanting you to step round with me\nto old Driscoll's. If Undine's reasons are as good as mine--\"\n\n\"Stop right here, Elmer Moffatt!\" the older man broke out with lifted\nhand. Moffatt made a burlesque feint of evading a blow; then his face\ngrew serious, and he moved close to Mr. Spragg, whose arm had fallen to\nhis side.\n\n\"See here, I know Undine's reasons. I've had a talk with her--didn't\nshe tell you? SHE don't beat about the bush the way you do. She told\nme straight out what was bothering her. She wants the Marvells to think\nshe's right out of Kindergarten. 'No goods sent out on approval from\nthis counter.' And I see her point--_I_ don't mean to publish my\nmeemo'rs. Only a deal's a deal.\" He paused a moment, twisting his\nfingers about the heavy gold watch-chain that crossed his waistcoat.\n\"Tell you what, Mr. Spragg, I don't bear malice--not against Undine,\nanyway--and if I could have afforded it I'd have been glad enough to\noblige her and forget old times. But you didn't hesitate to kick me when\nI was down and it's taken me a day or two to get on my legs again after\nthat kicking. I see my way now to get there and keep there; and there's\na kinder poetic justice in your being the man to help me up. If I can\nget hold of fifty thousand dollars within a day or so I don't care who's\ngot the start of me. I've got a dead sure thing in sight, and you're the\nonly man that can get it for me. Now do you see where we're coming out?\"\n\nMr. Spragg, during this discourse, had remained motionless, his hands\nin his pockets, his jaws moving mechanically, as though he mumbled a\ntooth-pick under his beard. His sallow cheek had turned a shade paler,\nand his brows hung threateningly over his half-closed eyes. But there\nwas no threat--there was scarcely more than a note of dull curiosity--in\nthe voice with which he said: \"You mean to talk?\"\n\nMoffatt's rosy face grew as hard as a steel safe. \"I mean YOU to\ntalk--to old Driscoll.\" He paused, and then added: \"It's a hundred\nthousand down, between us.\"\n\nMr. Spragg once more consulted his watch. \"I'll see you again,\" he said\nwith an effort.\n\nMoffatt struck one fist against the other. \"No, SIR--you won't! You'll\nonly hear from me--through the Marvell family. Your news ain't worth a\ndollar to Driscoll if he don't get it to-day.\"\n\nHe was checked by the sound of steps in the outer office, and Mr.\nSpragg's stenographer appeared in the doorway.\n\n\"It's Mr. Marvell,\" she announced; and Ralph Marvell, glowing with haste\nand happiness, stood between the two men, holding out his hand to Mr.\nSpragg.\n\n\"Am I awfully in the way, sir? Turn me out if I am--but first let me\njust say a word about this necklace I've ordered for Un--\"\n\nHe broke off, made aware by Mr. Spragg's glance of the presence of Elmer\nMoffatt, who, with unwonted discretion, had dropped back into the\nshadow of the door. Marvell turned on Moffatt a bright gaze full of the\ninstinctive hospitality of youth; but Moffatt looked straight past him\nat Mr. Spragg. The latter, as if in response to an imperceptible signal,\nmechanically pronounced his visitor's name; and the two young men moved\ntoward each other.\n\n\"I beg your pardon most awfully--am I breaking up an important\nconference?\" Ralph asked as he shook hands.\n\n\"Why, no--I guess we're pretty nearly through. I'll step outside and woo\nthe blonde while you're talking,\" Moffatt rejoined in the same key.\n\n\"Thanks so much--I shan't take two seconds.\" Ralph broke off to\nscrutinize him. \"But haven't we met before? It seems to me I've seen\nyou--just lately--\"\n\nMoffatt seemed about to answer, but his reply was checked by an abrupt\nmovement on the part of Mr. Spragg. There was a perceptible pause,\nduring which Moffatt's bright black glance rested questioningly on\nRalph; then he looked again at the older man, and their eyes held each\nother for a silent moment.\n\n\"Why, no--not as I'm aware of, Mr. Marvell,\" Moffatt said, addressing\nhimself amicably to Ralph. \"Better late than never, though--and I hope\nto have the pleasure soon again.\"\n\nHe divided a nod between the two men, and passed into the outer\noffice, where they heard him addressing the stenographer in a strain of\nexaggerated gallantry.\n\n\n\nXI\n\nThe July sun enclosed in a ring of fire the ilex grove of a villa in the\nhills near Siena.\n\nBelow, by the roadside, the long yellow house seemed to waver and\npalpitate in the glare; but steep by steep, behind it, the cool\nilex-dusk mounted to the ledge where Ralph Marvell, stretched on his\nback in the grass, lay gazing up at a black reticulation of branches\nbetween which bits of sky gleamed with the hardness and brilliancy of\nblue enamel.\n\nUp there too the air was thick with heat; but compared with the white\nfire below it was a dim and tempered warmth, like that of the churches\nin which he and Undine sometimes took refuge at the height of the torrid\ndays.\n\nRalph loved the heavy Italian summer, as he had loved the light spring\ndays leading up to it: the long line of dancing days that had drawn\nthem on and on ever since they had left their ship at Naples four months\nearlier. Four months of beauty, changeful, inexhaustible, weaving itself\nabout him in shapes of softness and strength; and beside him, hand in\nhand with him, embodying that spirit of shifting magic, the radiant\ncreature through whose eyes he saw it. This was what their hastened\nmarriage had blessed them with, giving them leisure, before summer came,\nto penetrate to remote folds of the southern mountains, to linger in the\nshade of Sicilian orange-groves, and finally, travelling by slow stages\nto the Adriatic, to reach the central hill-country where even in July\nthey might hope for a breathable air.\n\nTo Ralph the Sienese air was not only breathable but intoxicating. The\nsun, treading the earth like a vintager, drew from it heady fragrances,\ncrushed out of it new colours. All the values of the temperate landscape\nwere reversed: the noon high-lights were whiter but the shadows had\nunimagined colour. On the blackness of cork and ilex and cypress lay the\ngreen and purple lustres, the coppery iridescences, of old bronze; and\nnight after night the skies were wine-blue and bubbling with stars.\nRalph said to himself that no one who had not seen Italy thus prostrate\nbeneath the sun knew what secret treasures she could yield.\n\nAs he lay there, fragments of past states of emotion, fugitive\nfelicities of thought and sensation, rose and floated on the surface\nof his thoughts. It was one of those moments when the accumulated\nimpressions of life converge on heart and brain, elucidating, enlacing\neach other, in a mysterious confusion of beauty. He had had glimpses of\nsuch a state before, of such mergings of the personal with the general\nlife that one felt one's self a mere wave on the wild stream of being,\nyet thrilled with a sharper sense of individuality than can be known\nwithin the mere bounds of the actual. But now he knew the sensation in\nits fulness, and with it came the releasing power of language. Words\nwere flashing like brilliant birds through the boughs overhead; he had\nbut to wave his magic wand to have them flutter down to him. Only they\nwere so beautiful up there, weaving their fantastic flights against the\nblue, that it was pleasanter, for the moment, to watch them and let the\nwand lie.\n\nHe stared up at the pattern they made till his eyes ached with excess of\nlight; then he changed his position and looked at his wife.\n\nUndine, near by, leaned against a gnarled tree with the slightly\nconstrained air of a person unused to sylvan abandonments. Her beautiful\nback could not adapt itself to the irregularities of the tree-trunk,\nand she moved a little now and then in the effort to find an easier\nposition. But her expression was serene, and Ralph, looking up at her\nthrough drowsy lids, thought her face had never been more exquisite.\n\n\"You look as cool as a wave,\" he said, reaching out for the hand on her\nknee. She let him have it, and he drew it closer, scrutinizing it as if\nit had been a bit of precious porcelain or ivory. It was small and soft,\na mere featherweight, a puff-ball of a hand--not quick and thrilling,\nnot a speaking hand, but one to be fondled and dressed in rings, and\nto leave a rosy blur in the brain. The fingers were short and tapering,\ndimpled at the base, with nails as smooth as rose-leaves. Ralph lifted\nthem one by one, like a child playing with piano-keys, but they were\ninelastic and did not spring back far--only far enough to show the\ndimples.\n\nHe turned the hand over and traced the course of its blue veins from the\nwrist to the rounding of the palm below the fingers; then he put a kiss\nin the warm hollow between. The upper world had vanished: his universe\nhad shrunk to the palm of a hand. But there was no sense of diminution.\nIn the mystic depths whence his passion sprang, earthly dimensions were\nignored and the curve of beauty was boundless enough to hold whatever\nthe imagination could pour into it. Ralph had never felt more convinced\nof his power to write a great poem; but now it was Undine's hand which\nheld the magic wand of expression.\n\nShe stirred again uneasily, answering his last words with a faint accent\nof reproach.\n\n\"I don't FEEL cool. You said there'd be a breeze up here.\".\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"You poor darling! Wasn't it ever as hot as this in Apex?\"\n\nShe withdrew her hand with a slight grimace.\n\n\"Yes--but I didn't marry you to go back to Apex!\"\n\nRalph laughed again; then he lifted himself on his elbow and regained\nthe hand. \"I wonder what you DID marry me for?\"\n\n\"Mercy! It's too hot for conundrums.\" She spoke without impatience, but\nwith a lassitude less joyous than his.\n\nHe roused himself. \"Do you really mind the heat so much? We'll go, if\nyou do.\"\n\nShe sat up eagerly. \"Go to Switzerland, you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, I hadn't taken quite as long a leap. I only meant we might drive\nback to Siena.\"\n\nShe relapsed listlessly against her tree-trunk. \"Oh, Siena's hotter than\nthis.\"\n\n\"We could go and sit in the cathedral--it's always cool there at\nsunset.\"\n\n\"We've sat in the cathedral at sunset every day for a week.\"\n\n\"Well, what do you say to stopping at Lecceto on the way? I haven't\nshown you Lecceto yet; and the drive back by moonlight would be\nglorious.\"\n\nThis woke her to a slight show of interest. \"It might be nice--but where\ncould we get anything to eat?\"\n\nRalph laughed again. \"I don't believe we could. You're too practical.\"\n\n\"Well, somebody's got to be. And the food in the hotel is too disgusting\nif we're not on time.\"\n\n\"I admit that the best of it has usually been appropriated by the\nextremely good-looking cavalry-officer who's so keen to know you.\"\n\nUndine's face brightened. \"You know he's not a Count; he's a Marquis.\nHis name's Roviano; his palace in Rome is in the guide-books, and\nhe speaks English beautifully. Celeste found out about him from the\nheadwaiter,\" she said, with the security of one who treats of recognized\nvalues.\n\nMarvell, sitting upright, reached lazily across the grass for his hat.\n\"Then there's all the more reason for rushing back to defend our share.\"\nHe spoke in the bantering tone which had become the habitual expression\nof his tenderness; but his eyes softened as they absorbed in a last\nglance the glimmering submarine light of the ancient grove, through\nwhich Undine's figure wavered nereid-like above him.\n\n\"You never looked your name more than you do now,\" he said, kneeling\nat her side and putting his arm about her. She smiled back a little\nvaguely, as if not seizing his allusion, and being content to let it\ndrop into the store of unexplained references which had once stimulated\nher curiosity but now merely gave her leisure to think of other things.\nBut her smile was no less lovely for its vagueness, and indeed, to\nRalph, the loveliness was enhanced by the latent doubt. He remembered\nafterward that at that moment the cup of life seemed to brim over.\n\n\"Come, dear--here or there--it's all divine!\"\n\nIn the carriage, however, she remained insensible to the soft spell of\nthe evening, noticing only the heat and dust, and saying, as they passed\nunder the wooded cliff of Lecceto, that they might as well have stopped\nthere after all, since with such a headache as she felt coming on she\ndidn't care if she dined or not. Ralph looked up yearningly at the long\nwalls overhead; but Undine's mood was hardly favourable to communion\nwith such scenes, and he made no attempt to stop the carriage. Instead\nhe presently said: \"If you're tired of Italy, we've got the world to\nchoose from.\"\n\nShe did not speak for a moment; then she said: \"It's the heat I'm tired\nof. Don't people generally come here earlier?\"\n\n\"Yes. That's why I chose the summer: so that we could have it all to\nourselves.\"\n\nShe tried to put a note of reasonableness into her voice. \"If you'd told\nme we were going everywhere at the wrong time, of course I could have\narranged about my clothes.\"\n\n\"You poor darling! Let us, by all means, go to the place where the\nclothes will be right: they're too beautiful to be left out of our\nscheme of life.\"\n\nHer lips hardened. \"I know you don't care how I look. But you didn't\ngive me time to order anything before we were married, and I've got\nnothing but my last winter's things to wear.\"\n\nRalph smiled. Even his subjugated mind perceived the inconsistency\nof Undine's taxing him with having hastened their marriage; but her\nvariations on the eternal feminine still enchanted him.\n\n\"We'll go wherever you please--you make every place the one place,\" he\nsaid, as if he were humouring an irresistible child.\n\n\"To Switzerland, then? Celeste says St. Moritz is too heavenly,\"\nexclaimed Undine, who gathered her ideas of Europe chiefly from the\nconversation of her experienced attendant.\n\n\"One can be cool short of the Engadine. Why not go south again--say to\nCapri?\"\n\n\"Capri? Is that the island we saw from Naples, where the artists go?\"\nShe drew her brows together. \"It would be simply awful getting there in\nthis heat.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I know a little place in Switzerland where one can still\nget away from the crowd, and we can sit and look at a green water-fall\nwhile I lie in wait for adjectives.\"\n\nMr. Spragg's astonishment on learning that his son-in-law contemplated\nmaintaining a household on the earnings of his Muse was still matter for\npleasantry between the pair; and one of the humours of their first weeks\ntogether had consisted in picturing themselves as a primeval couple\nsetting forth across a virgin continent and subsisting on the adjectives\nwhich Ralph was to trap for his epic. On this occasion, however, his\nwife did not take up the joke, and he remained silent while their\ncarriage climbed the long dusty hill to the Fontebranda gate. He had\nseen her face droop as he suggested the possibility of an escape from\nthe crowds in Switzerland, and it came to him, with the sharpness of\na knife-thrust, that a crowd was what she wanted--that she was sick to\ndeath of being alone with him.\n\nHe sat motionless, staring ahead at the red-brown walls and towers\non the steep above them. After all there was nothing sudden in his\ndiscovery. For weeks it had hung on the edge of consciousness, but\nhe had turned from it with the heart's instinctive clinging to the\nunrealities by which it lives. Even now a hundred qualifying reasons\nrushed to his aid. They told him it was not of himself that Undine had\nwearied, but only of their present way of life. He had said a moment\nbefore, without conscious exaggeration, that her presence made any place\nthe one place; yet how willingly would he have consented to share in\nsuch a life as she was leading before their marriage? And he had to\nacknowledge their months of desultory wandering from one remote Italian\nhill-top to another must have seemed as purposeless to her as balls and\ndinners would have been to him. An imagination like his, peopled with\nsuch varied images and associations, fed by so many currents from the\nlong stream of human experience, could hardly picture the bareness of\nthe small half-lit place in which his wife's spirit fluttered. Her mind\nwas as destitute of beauty and mystery as the prairie school-house in\nwhich she had been educated; and her ideals seemed to Ralph as pathetic\nas the ornaments made of corks and cigar-bands with which her infant\nhands had been taught to adorn it. He was beginning to understand this,\nand learning to adapt himself to the narrow compass of her experience.\nThe task of opening new windows in her mind was inspiring enough to\ngive him infinite patience; and he would not yet own to himself that her\npliancy and variety were imitative rather than spontaneous.\n\nMeanwhile he had no desire to sacrifice her wishes to his, and it\ndistressed him that he dared not confess his real reason for avoiding\nthe Engadine. The truth was that their funds were shrinking faster\nthan he had expected. Mr. Spragg, after bluntly opposing their hastened\nmarriage on the ground that he was not prepared, at such short notice,\nto make the necessary provision for his daughter, had shortly afterward\n(probably, as Undine observed to Ralph, in consequence of a lucky \"turn\"\nin the Street) met their wishes with all possible liberality, bestowing\non them a wedding in conformity with Mrs. Spragg's ideals and up to\nthe highest standard of Mrs. Heeny's clippings, and pledging himself to\nprovide Undine with an income adequate to so brilliant a beginning. It\nwas understood that Ralph, on their return, should renounce the law for\nsome more paying business; but this seemed the smallest of sacrifices to\nmake for the privilege of calling Undine his wife; and besides, he still\nsecretly hoped that, in the interval, his real vocation might declare\nitself in some work which would justify his adopting the life of\nletters.\n\nHe had assumed that Undine's allowance, with the addition of his own\nsmall income, would be enough to satisfy their needs. His own were few,\nand had always been within his means; but his wife's daily requirements,\ncombined with her intermittent outbreaks of extravagance, had thrown out\nall his calculations, and they were already seriously exceeding their\nincome.\n\nIf any one had prophesied before his marriage that he would find it\ndifficult to tell this to Undine he would have smiled at the suggestion;\nand during their first days together it had seemed as though pecuniary\nquestions were the last likely to be raised between them. But his\nmarital education had since made strides, and he now knew that a\ndisregard for money may imply not the willingness to get on without\nit but merely a blind confidence that it will somehow be provided. If\nUndine, like the lilies of the field, took no care, it was not because\nher wants were as few but because she assumed that care would be taken\nfor her by those whose privilege it was to enable her to unite floral\ninsouciance with Sheban elegance.\n\nShe had met Ralph's first note of warning with the assurance that she\n\"didn't mean to worry\"; and her tone implied that it was his business\nto do so for her. He certainly wanted to guard her from this as from all\nother cares; he wanted also, and still more passionately after the topic\nhad once or twice recurred between them, to guard himself from the risk\nof judging where he still adored. These restraints to frankness kept him\nsilent during the remainder of the drive, and when, after dinner, Undine\nagain complained of her headache, he let her go up to her room and\nwandered out into the dimly lit streets to renewed communion with his\nproblems.\n\nThey hung on him insistently as darkness fell, and Siena grew vocal\nwith that shrill diversity of sounds that breaks, on summer nights, from\nevery cleft of the masonry in old Italian towns. Then the moon rose,\nunfolding depth by depth the lines of the antique land; and Ralph,\nleaning against an old brick parapet, and watching each silver-blue\nremoteness disclose itself between the dark masses of the middle\ndistance, felt his spirit enlarged and pacified. For the first time, as\nhis senses thrilled to the deep touch of beauty, he asked himself if out\nof these floating and fugitive vibrations he might not build something\nconcrete and stable, if even such dull common cares as now oppressed him\nmight not become the motive power of creation. If he could only, on\nthe spot, do something with all the accumulated spoils of the last\nmonths--something that should both put money into his pocket and harmony\ninto the rich confusion of his spirit! \"I'll write--I'll write: that\nmust be what the whole thing means,\" he said to himself, with a vague\nclutch at some solution which should keep him a little longer hanging\nhalf-way down the steep of disenchantment.\n\nHe would have stayed on, heedless of time, to trace the ramifications\nof his idea in the complex beauty of the scene, but for the longing to\nshare his mood with Undine. For the last few months every thought and\nsensation had been instantly transmuted into such emotional impulses\nand, though the currents of communication between himself and Undine\nwere neither deep nor numerous, each fresh rush of feeling seemed\nstrong enough to clear a way to her heart. He hurried back, almost\nbreathlessly, to the inn; but even as he knocked at her door the subtle\nemanation of other influences seemed to arrest and chill him.\n\nShe had put out the lamp, and sat by the window in the moonlight, her\nhead propped on a listless hand. As Marvell entered she turned; then,\nwithout speaking, she looked away again.\n\nHe was used to this mute reception, and had learned that it had no\npersonal motive, but was the result of an extremely simplified social\ncode. Mr. and Mrs. Spragg seldom spoke to each other when they met, and\nwords of greeting seemed almost unknown to their domestic vocabulary.\nMarvell, at first, had fancied that his own warmth would call forth\na response from his wife, who had been so quick to learn the forms of\nworldly intercourse; but he soon saw that she regarded intimacy as a\npretext for escaping from such forms into a total absence of expression.\n\nTo-night, however, he felt another meaning in her silence, and perceived\nthat she intended him to feel it. He met it by silence, but of a\ndifferent kind; letting his nearness speak for him as he knelt beside\nher and laid his cheek against hers. She seemed hardly aware of\nthe gesture; but to that he was also used. She had never shown any\nrepugnance to his tenderness, but such response as it evoked was remote\nand Ariel-like, suggesting, from the first, not so much of the recoil of\nignorance as the coolness of the element from which she took her name.\n\nAs he pressed her to him she seemed to grow less impassive and he felt\nher resign herself like a tired child. He held his breath, not daring to\nbreak the spell.\n\nAt length he whispered: \"I've just seen such a wonderful thing--I wish\nyou'd been with me!\"\n\n\"What sort of a thing?\" She turned her head with a faint show of\ninterest.\n\n\"A--I don't know--a vision.... It came to me out there just now with the\nmoonrise.\"\n\n\"A vision?\" Her interest flagged. \"I never cared much about spirits.\nMother used to try to drag me to seances--but they always made me\nsleepy.\"\n\nRalph laughed. \"I don't mean a dead spirit but a living one! I saw the\nvision of a book I mean to do. It came to me suddenly, magnificently,\nswooped down on me as that big white moon swooped down on the black\nlandscape, tore at me like a great white eagle-like the bird of Jove!\nAfter all, imagination WAS the eagle that devoured Prometheus!\"\n\nShe drew away abruptly, and the bright moonlight showed him the\napprehension in her face. \"You're not going to write a book HERE?\"\n\nHe stood up and wandered away a step or two; then he turned and came\nback. \"Of course not here. Wherever you want. The main point is that\nit's come to me--no, that it's come BACK to me! For it's all these\nmonths together, it's all our happiness--it's the meaning of life that\nI've found, and it's you, dearest, you who've given it to me!\"\n\nHe dropped down beside her again; but she disengaged herself and he\nheard a little sob in her throat.\n\n\"Undine--what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing...I don't know...I suppose I'm homesick...\"\n\n\"Homesick? You poor darling! You're tired of travelling? What is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know...I don't like Europe...it's not what I expected, and I\nthink it's all too dreadfully dreary!\" The words broke from her in a\nlong wail of rebellion.\n\nMarvell gazed at her perplexedly. It seemed strange that such unguessed\nthoughts should have been stirring in the heart pressed to his. \"It's\nless interesting than you expected--or less amusing? Is that it?\"\n\n\"It's dirty and ugly--all the towns we've been to are disgustingly\ndirty. I loathe the smells and the beggars. I'm sick and tired of the\nstuffy rooms in the hotels. I thought it would all be so splendid--but\nNew York's ever so much nicer!\"\n\n\"Not New York in July?\"\n\n\"I don't care--there are the roof-gardens, anyway; and there are always\npeople round. All these places seem as if they were dead. It's all like\nsome awful cemetery.\"\n\nA sense of compunction checked Marvell's laughter. \"Don't cry,\ndear--don't! I see, I understand. You're lonely and the heat has tired\nyou out. It IS dull here; awfully dull; I've been stupid not to feel it.\nBut we'll start at once--we'll get out of it.\"\n\nShe brightened instantly. \"We'll go up to Switzerland?\"\n\n\"We'll go up to Switzerland.\" He had a fleeting glimpse of the quiet\nplace with the green water-fall, where he might have made tryst with his\nvision; then he turned his mind from it and said: \"We'll go just where\nyou want. How soon can you be ready to start?\"\n\n\"Oh, to-morrow--the first thing to-morrow! I'll make Celeste get out\nof bed now and pack. Can we go right through to St. Moritz? I'd rather\nsleep in the train than in another of these awful places.\"\n\nShe was on her feet in a flash, her face alight, her hair waving and\nfloating about her as though it rose on her happy heart-beats.\n\n\"Oh, Ralph, it's SWEET of you, and I love you!\" she cried out, letting\nhim take her to his breast.\n\n\n\nXII\n\nIn the quiet place with the green water-fall Ralph's vision might\nhave kept faith with him; but how could he hope to surprise it in the\nmidsummer crowds of St. Moritz? Undine, at any rate, had found there\nwhat she wanted; and when he was at her side, and her radiant smile\nincluded him, every other question was in abeyance. But there were hours\nof solitary striding over bare grassy slopes, face to face with the\nironic interrogation of sky and mountains, when his anxieties came back,\nmore persistent and importunate. Sometimes they took the form of merely\nmaterial difficulties. How, for instance, was he to meet the cost of\ntheir ruinous suite at the Engadine Palace while he awaited Mr. Spragg's\nnext remittance? And once the hotel bills were paid, what would be left\nfor the journey back to Paris, the looming expenses there, the price\nof the passage to America? These questions would fling him back on the\nthought of his projected book, which was, after all, to be what the\nmasterpieces of literature had mostly been--a pot-boiler. Well! Why not?\nDid not the worshipper always heap the rarest essences on the altar\nof his divinity? Ralph still rejoiced in the thought of giving back to\nUndine something of the beauty of their first months together. But even\non his solitary walks the vision eluded him; and he could spare so few\nhours to its pursuit!\n\nUndine's days were crowded, and it was still a matter of course that\nwhere she went he should follow. He had risen visibly in her opinion\nsince they had been absorbed into the life of the big hotels, and she\nhad seen that his command of foreign tongues put him at an advantage\neven in circles where English was generally spoken if not understood.\nUndine herself, hampered by her lack of languages, was soon drawn into\nthe group of compatriots who struck the social pitch of their hotel.\n\nTheir types were familiar enough to Ralph, who had taken their measure\nin former wanderings, and come across their duplicates in every scene\nof continental idleness. Foremost among them was Mrs. Harvey Shallum,\na showy Parisianized figure, with a small wax-featured husband whose\nultra-fashionable clothes seemed a tribute to his wife's importance\nrather than the mark of his personal taste. Mr. Shallum, in fact,\ncould not be said to have any personal bent. Though he conversed with\na colourless fluency in the principal European tongues, he seldom\nexercised his gift except in intercourse with hotel-managers and\nhead-waiters; and his long silences were broken only by resigned\nallusions to the enormities he had suffered at the hands of this gifted\nbut unscrupulous class.\n\nMrs. Shallum, though in command of but a few verbs, all of which, on\nher lips, became irregular, managed to express a polyglot personality\nas vivid as her husband's was effaced. Her only idea of intercourse\nwith her kind was to organize it into bands and subject it to frequent\ndisplacements; and society smiled at her for these exertions like an\ninfant vigorously rocked. She saw at once Undine's value as a factor in\nher scheme, and the two formed an alliance on which Ralph refrained from\nshedding the cold light of depreciation. It was a point of honour\nwith him not to seem to disdain any of Undine's amusements: the\nnoisy interminable picnics, the hot promiscuous balls, the concerts,\nbridge-parties and theatricals which helped to disguise the difference\nbetween the high Alps and Paris or New York. He told himself that there\nis always a Narcissus-element in youth, and that what Undine really\nenjoyed was the image of her own charm mirrored in the general\nadmiration. With her quick perceptions and adaptabilities she would\nsoon learn to care more about the quality of the reflecting surface; and\nmeanwhile no criticism of his should mar her pleasure.\n\nThe appearance at their hotel of the cavalry-officer from Siena was a\nnot wholly agreeable surprise; but even after the handsome Marquis had\nbeen introduced to Undine, and had whirled her through an evening's\ndances, Ralph was not seriously disturbed. Husband and wife had grown\ncloser to each other since they had come to St. Moritz, and in the brief\nmoments she could give him Undine was now always gay and approachable.\nHer fitful humours had vanished, and she showed qualities of comradeship\nthat seemed the promise of a deeper understanding. But this very hope\nmade him more subject to her moods, more fearful of disturbing the\nharmony between them. Least of all could he broach the subject of money:\nhe had too keen a memory of the way her lips could narrow, and her eyes\nturn from him as if he were a stranger.\n\nIt was a different matter that one day brought the look he feared to her\nface. She had announced her intention of going on an excursion with Mrs.\nShallum and three or four of the young men who formed the nucleus of\ntheir shifting circle, and for the first time she did not ask Ralph\nif he were coming; but he felt no resentment at being left out. He was\ntired of these noisy assaults on the high solitudes, and the prospect\nof a quiet afternoon turned his thoughts to his book. Now if ever there\nseemed a chance of recapturing the moonlight vision...\n\nFrom his balcony he looked down on the assembling party. Mrs. Shallum\nwas already screaming bilingually at various windows in the long facade;\nand Undine presently came out of the hotel with the Marchese Roviano and\ntwo young English diplomatists. Slim and tall in her trim mountain\ngarb, she made the ornate Mrs. Shallum look like a piece of ambulant\nupholstery. The high air brightened her cheeks and struck new lights\nfrom her hair, and Ralph had never seen her so touched with morning\nfreshness. The party was not yet complete, and he felt a movement of\nannoyance when he recognized, in the last person to join it, a Russian\nlady of cosmopolitan notoriety whom he had run across in his unmarried\ndays, and as to whom he had already warned Undine. Knowing what\nstrange specimens from the depths slip through the wide meshes of the\nwatering-place world, he had foreseen that a meeting with the Baroness\nAdelschein was inevitable; but he had not expected her to become one of\nhis wife's intimate circle.\n\nWhen the excursionists had started he turned back to his writing-table\nand tried to take up his work; but he could not fix his thoughts:\nthey were far away, in pursuit of Undine. He had been but five months\nmarried, and it seemed, after all, rather soon for him to be dropped out\nof such excursions as unquestioningly as poor Harvey Shallum. He smiled\naway this first twinge of jealousy, but the irritation it left found\na pretext in his displeasure at Undine's choice of companions. Mrs.\nShallum grated on his taste, but she was as open to inspection as\na shop-window, and he was sure that time would teach his wife the\ncheapness of what she had to show. Roviano and the Englishmen were well\nenough too: frankly bent on amusement, but pleasant and well-bred. But\nthey would naturally take their tone from the women they were with;\nand Madame Adelschein's tone was notorious. He knew also that Undine's\nfaculty of self-defense was weakened by the instinct of adapting herself\nto whatever company she was in, of copying \"the others\" in speech and\ngesture as closely as she reflected them in dress; and he was disturbed\nby the thought of what her ignorance might expose her to.\n\nShe came back late, flushed with her long walk, her face all sparkle and\nmystery, as he had seen it in the first days of their courtship; and the\nlook somehow revived his irritated sense of having been intentionally\nleft out of the party.\n\n\"You've been gone forever. Was it the Adelschein who made you go such\nlengths?\" he asked her, trying to keep to his usual joking tone.\n\nUndine, as she dropped down on the sofa and unpinned her hat, shed on\nhim the light of her guileless gaze.\n\n\"I don't know: everybody was amusing. The Marquis is awfully bright.\"\n\n\"I'd no idea you or Bertha Shallum knew Madame Adelschein well enough to\ntake her off with you in that way.\"\n\nUndine sat absently smoothing the tuft of glossy cock's-feathers in her\nhat.\n\n\"I don't see that you've got to know people particularly well to go for\na walk with them. The Baroness is awfully bright too.\"\n\nShe always gave her acquaintances their titles, seeming not, in this\nrespect, to have noticed that a simpler form prevailed.\n\n\"I don't dispute the interest of what she says; but I've told you what\ndecent people think of what she does,\" Ralph retorted, exasperated by\nwhat seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance.\n\nShe continued to scrutinize him with her clear eyes, in which there was\nno shadow of offense.\n\n\"You mean they don't want to go round with her? You're mistaken: it's\nnot true. She goes round with everybody. She dined last night with the\nGrand Duchess; Roviano told me so.\"\n\nThis was not calculated to make Ralph take a more tolerant view of the\nquestion.\n\n\"Does he also tell you what's said of her?\"\n\n\"What's said of her?\" Undine's limpid glance rebuked him. \"Do you mean\nthat disgusting scandal you told me about? Do you suppose I'd let him\ntalk to me about such things? I meant you're mistaken about her social\nposition. He says she goes everywhere.\"\n\nRalph laughed impatiently. \"No doubt Roviano's an authority; but it\ndoesn't happen to be his business to choose your friends for you.\"\n\nUndine echoed his laugh. \"Well, I guess I don't need anybody to do that:\nI can do it myself,\" she said, with the good-humoured curtness that was\nthe habitual note of intercourse with the Spraggs.\n\nRalph sat down beside her and laid a caressing touch on her shoulder.\n\"No, you can't, you foolish child. You know nothing of this society\nyou're in; of its antecedents, its rules, its conventions; and it's my\naffair to look after you, and warn you when you're on the wrong track.\"\n\n\"Mercy, what a solemn speech!\" She shrugged away his hand without\nill-temper. \"I don't believe an American woman needs to know such a lot\nabout their old rules. They can see I mean to follow my own, and if they\ndon't like it they needn't go with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, they'll go with you fast enough, as you call it. They'll be too\ncharmed to. The question is how far they'll make you go with THEM, and\nwhere they'll finally land you.\"\n\nShe tossed her head back with the movement she had learned in \"speaking\"\nschool-pieces about freedom and the British tyrant.\n\n\"No one's ever yet gone any farther with me than I wanted!\" she\ndeclared. She was really exquisitely simple.\n\n\"I'm not sure Roviano hasn't, in vouching for Madame Adelschein. But he\nprobably thinks you know about her. To him this isn't 'society' any more\nthan the people in an omnibus are. Society, to everybody here, means\nthe sanction of their own special group and of the corresponding groups\nelsewhere. The Adelschein goes about in a place like this because it's\nnobody's business to stop her; but the women who tolerate her here would\ndrop her like a shot if she set foot on their own ground.\"\n\nThe thoughtful air with which Undine heard him out made him fancy this\nargument had carried; and as be ended she threw him a bright look.\n\n\"Well, that's easy enough: I can drop her if she comes to New York.\"\n\nRalph sat silent for a moment--then he turned away and began to gather\nup his scattered pages.\n\nUndine, in the ensuing days, was no less often with Madame Adelschein,\nand Ralph suspected a challenge in her open frequentation of the lady.\nBut if challenge there were, he let it lie. Whether his wife saw more or\nless of Madame Adelschein seemed no longer of much consequence: she had\nso amply shown him her ability to protect herself. The pang lay in the\ncompleteness of the proof--in the perfect functioning of her instinct\nof self-preservation. For the first time he was face to face with his\nhovering dread: he was judging where he still adored.\n\nBefore long more pressing cares absorbed him. He had already begun\nto watch the post for his father-in-law's monthly remittance, without\nprecisely knowing how, even with its aid, he was to bridge the gulf of\nexpense between St. Moritz and New York. The non-arrival of Mr. Spragg's\ncheque was productive of graver tears, and these were abruptly confirmed\nwhen, coming in one afternoon, he found Undine crying over a letter from\nher mother.\n\nHer distress made him fear that Mr. Spragg was ill, and he drew her to\nhim soothingly; but she broke away with an impatient movement.\n\n\"Oh, they're all well enough--but father's lost a lot of money. He's\nbeen speculating, and he can't send us anything for at least three\nmonths.\"\n\nRalph murmured reassuringly: \"As long as there's no one ill!\"--but in\nreality he was following her despairing gaze down the long perspective\nof their barren quarter.\n\n\"Three months! Three months!\"\n\nUndine dried her eyes, and sat with set lips and tapping foot while he\nread her mother's letter.\n\n\"Your poor father! It's a hard knock for him. I'm sorry,\" he said as he\nhanded it back.\n\nFor a moment she did not seem to hear; then she said between her teeth:\n\"It's hard for US. I suppose now we'll have to go straight home.\"\n\nHe looked at her with wonder. \"If that were all! In any case I should\nhave to be back in a few weeks.\"\n\n\"But we needn't have left here in August! It's the first place in Europe\nthat I've liked, and it's just my luck to be dragged away from it!\"\n\n\"I'm so awfully sorry, dearest. It's my fault for persuading you to\nmarry a pauper.\"\n\n\"It's father's fault. Why on earth did he go and speculate? There's no\nuse his saying he's sorry now!\" She sat brooding for a moment and then\nsuddenly took Ralph's hand. \"Couldn't your people do something--help us\nout just this once, I mean?\"\n\nHe flushed to the forehead: it seemed inconceivable that she should make\nsuch a suggestion.\n\n\"I couldn't ask them--it's not possible. My grandfather does as much as\nhe can for me, and my mother has nothing but what he gives her.\"\n\nUndine seemed unconscious of his embarrassment. \"He doesn't give us\nnearly as much as father does,\" she said; and, as Ralph remained silent,\nshe went on:\n\n\"Couldn't you ask your sister, then? I must have some clothes to go home\nin.\"\n\nHis heart contracted as he looked at her. What sinister change came\nover her when her will was crossed? She seemed to grow inaccessible,\nimplacable--her eyes were like the eyes of an enemy.\n\n\"I don't know--I'll see,\" he said, rising and moving away from her.\nAt that moment the touch of her hand was repugnant. Yes--he might ask\nLaura, no doubt: and whatever she had would be his. But the necessity\nwas bitter to him, and Undine's unconsciousness of the fact hurt him\nmore than her indifference to her father's misfortune.\n\nWhat hurt him most was the curious fact that, for all her light\nirresponsibility, it was always she who made the practical suggestion,\nhit the nail of expediency on the head. No sentimental scruple made the\nblow waver or deflected her resolute aim. She had thought at once of\nLaura, and Laura was his only, his inevitable, resource. His anxious\nmind pictured his sister's wonder, and made him wince under the sting of\nHenley Fairford's irony: Fairford, who at the time of the marriage had\nsat silent and pulled his moustache while every one else argued and\nobjected, yet under whose silence Ralph had felt a deeper protest than\nunder all the reasoning of the others. It was no comfort to reflect\nthat Fairford would probably continue to say nothing! But necessity made\nlight of these twinges, and Ralph set his teeth and cabled.\n\nUndine's chief surprise seemed to be that Laura's response, though\nimmediate and generous, did not enable them to stay on at St. Moritz.\nBut she apparently read in her husband's look the uselessness of such\na hope, for, with one of the sudden changes of mood that still disarmed\nhim, she accepted the need of departure, and took leave philosophically\nof the Shallums and their band. After all, Paris was ahead, and in\nSeptember one would have a chance to see the new models and surprise the\nsecret councils of the dressmakers.\n\nRalph was astonished at the tenacity with which she held to her purpose.\nHe tried, when they reached Paris, to make her feel the necessity of\nstarting at once for home; but she complained of fatigue and of feeling\nvaguely unwell, and he had to yield to her desire for rest. The word,\nhowever, was to strike him as strangely misapplied, for from the day of\ntheir arrival she was in state of perpetual activity. She seemed to\nhave mastered her Paris by divination, and between the hounds of the\nBoulevards and the Place Vendome she moved at once with supernatural\nease.\n\n\"Of course,\" she explained to him, \"I understand how little we've got\nto spend; but I left New York without a rag, and it was you who made me\ncountermand my trousseau, instead of having it sent after us. I wish now\nI hadn't listened to you--father'd have had to pay for THAT before he\nlost his money. As it is, it will be cheaper in the end for me to pick\nup a few things here. The advantage of going to the French dress-makers\nis that they'll wait twice as long for their money as the people at\nhome. And they're all crazy to dress me--Bertha Shallum will tell you\nso: she says no one ever had such a chance! That's why I was willing to\ncome to this stuffy little hotel--I wanted to save every scrap I could\nto get a few decent things. And over here they're accustomed to being\nbargained with--you ought to see how I've beaten them down! Have you any\nidea what a dinner-dress costs in New York--?\"\n\nSo it went on, obtusely and persistently, whenever he tried to sound\nthe note of prudence. But on other themes she was more than usually\nresponsive. Paris enchanted her, and they had delightful hours at the\ntheatres--the \"little\" ones--amusing dinners at fashionable restaurants,\nand reckless evenings in haunts where she thrilled with simple glee\nat the thought of what she must so obviously be \"taken for.\" All these\nfamiliar diversions regained, for Ralph, a fresh zest in her\ncompany. Her innocence, her high spirits, her astounding comments and\ncredulities, renovated the old Parisian adventure and flung a veil of\nromance over its hackneyed scenes. Beheld through such a medium the\nfuture looked less near and implacable, and Ralph, when he had received\na reassuring letter from his sister, let his conscience sleep and\nslipped forth on the high tide of pleasure. After all, in New York\namusements would be fewer, and their life, for a time, perhaps more\nquiet. Moreover, Ralph's dim glimpses of Mr. Spragg's past suggested\nthat the latter was likely to be on his feet again at any moment, and\natoning by redoubled prodigalities for his temporary straits; and beyond\nall these possibilities there was the book to be written--the book on\nwhich Ralph was sure he should get a real hold as soon as they settled\ndown in New York.\n\nMeanwhile the daily cost of living, and the bills that could not be\ndeferred, were eating deep into Laura's subsidy. Ralph's anxieties\nreturned, and his plight was brought home to him with a shock when, on\ngoing one day to engage passages, he learned that the prices were that\nof the \"rush season,\" and one of the conditions immediate payment. At\nother times, he was told the rules were easier; but in September and\nOctober no exception could be made.\n\nAs he walked away with this fresh weight on his mind he caught sight of\nthe strolling figure of Peter Van Degen--Peter lounging and luxuriating\namong the seductions of the Boulevard with the disgusting ease of a\nman whose wants are all measured by money, and who always has enough to\ngratify them.\n\nHis present sense of these advantages revealed itself in the affability\nof his greeting to Ralph, and in his off-hand request that the latter\nshould \"look up Clare,\" who had come over with him to get her winter\nfinery.\n\n\"She's motoring to Italy next week with some of her long-haired\nfriends--but I'm off for the other side; going back on the Sorceress.\nShe's just been overhauled at Greenock, and we ought to have a good spin\nover. Better come along with me, old man.\"\n\nThe Sorceress was Van Degen's steam-yacht, most huge and complicated of\nher kind: it was his habit, after his semi-annual flights to Paris and\nLondon, to take a joyous company back on her and let Clare return by\nsteamer. The character of these parties made the invitation almost\nan offense to Ralph; but reflecting that it was probably a phrase\ndistributed to every acquaintance when Van Degen was in a rosy mood,\nhe merely answered: \"Much obliged, my dear fellow; but Undine and I are\nsailing immediately.\"\n\nPeter's glassy eye grew livelier. \"Ah, to be sure--you're not over the\nhoneymoon yet. How's the bride? Stunning as ever? My regards to her,\nplease. I suppose she's too deep in dress-making to be called on? Don't\nyou forget to look up Clare!\" He hurried on in pursuit of a flitting\npetticoat and Ralph continued his walk home.\n\nHe prolonged it a little in order to put off telling Undine of his\nplight; for he could devise only one way of meeting the cost of the\nvoyage, and that was to take it at once, and thus curtail their Parisian\nexpenses. But he knew how unwelcome this plan would be, and he shrank\nthe more from seeing Undine's face harden; since, of late, he had so\nbasked in its brightness.\n\nWhen at last he entered the little salon she called \"stuffy\" he found\nher in conference with a blond-bearded gentleman who wore the red ribbon\nin his lapel, and who, on Ralph's appearance--and at a sign, as it\nappeared, from Mrs. Marvell--swept into his note-case some small\nobjects that had lain on the table, and bowed himself out with a\n\"Madame--Monsieur\" worthy of the highest traditions.\n\nRalph looked after him with amusement. \"Who's your friend--an Ambassador\nor a tailor?\"\n\nUndine was rapidly slipping on her rings, which, as he now saw, had also\nbeen scattered over the table.\n\n\"Oh, it was only that jeweller I told you about--the one Bertha Shallum\ngoes to.\"\n\n\"A jeweller? Good heavens, my poor girl! You're buying jewels?\" The\nextravagance of the idea struck a laugh from him.\n\nUndine's face did not harden: it took on, instead, almost deprecating\nlook. \"Of course not--how silly you are! I only wanted a few old things\nreset. But I won't if you'd rather not.\"\n\nShe came to him and sat down at his side, laying her hand on his arm.\nHe took the hand up and looked at the deep gleam of the sapphires in the\nold family ring he had given her.\n\n\"You won't have that reset?\" he said, smiling and twisting the ring\nabout on her finger; then he went on with his thankless explanation.\n\"It's not that I don't want you to do this or that; it's simply that,\nfor the moment, we're rather strapped. I've just been to see the steamer\npeople, and our passages will cost a good deal more than I thought.\"\n\nHe mentioned the sum and the fact that he must give an answer the next\nday. Would she consent to sail that very Saturday? Or should they go a\nfortnight later, in a slow boat from Plymouth?\n\nUndine frowned on both alternatives. She was an indifferent sailor and\nshrank from the possible \"nastiness\" of the cheaper boat. She wanted\nto get the voyage over as quickly and luxuriously as possible--Bertha\nShallum had told her that in a \"deck-suite\" no one need be sea-sick--but\nshe wanted still more to have another week or two of Paris; and it was\nalways hard to make her see why circumstances could not be bent to her\nwishes.\n\n\"This week? But how on earth can I be ready? Besides, we're dining at\nEnghien with the Shallums on Saturday, and motoring to Chantilly with\nthe Jim Driscolls on Sunday. I can't imagine how you thought we could go\nthis week!\"\n\nBut she still opposed the cheap steamer, and after they had carried the\nquestion on to Voisin's, and there unprofitably discussed it through a\nlong luncheon, it seemed no nearer a solution.\n\n\"Well, think it over--let me know this evening,\" Ralph said,\nproportioning the waiter's fee to a bill burdened by Undine's reckless\nchoice of primeurs.\n\nHis wife was to join the newly-arrived Mrs. Shallum in a round of the\nrue de la Paix; and he had seized the opportunity of slipping off to a\nclassical performance at the Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais. On their arrival in Paris he had\ntaken Undine to one of these entertainments, but it left her too weary\nand puzzled for him to renew the attempt, and he had not found time\nto go back without her. He was glad now to shed his cares in such an\natmosphere. The play was of the greatest, the interpretation that of the\nvanishing grand manner which lived in his first memories of the Parisian\nstage, and his surrender such influences as complete as in his early\ndays. Caught up in the fiery chariot of art, he felt once more the\ntug of its coursers in his muscles, and the rush of their flight still\nthrobbed in him when he walked back late to the hotel.\n\n\n\nXIII\n\nHe had expected to find Undine still out; but on the stairs he crossed\nMrs. Shallum, who threw at him from under an immense hat-brim: \"Yes,\nshe's in, but you'd better come and have tea with me at the Luxe. I\ndon't think husbands are wanted!\"\n\nRalph laughingly rejoined that that was just the moment for them to\nappear; and Mrs. Shallum swept on, crying back: \"All the same, I'll wait\nfor you!\"\n\nIn the sitting-room Ralph found Undine seated behind a tea-table on the\nother side of which, in an attitude of easy intimacy, Peter Van Degen\nstretched his lounging length.\n\nHe did not move on Ralph's appearance, no doubt thinking their kinship\nclose enough to make his nod and \"Hullo!\" a sufficient greeting. Peter\nin intimacy was given to miscalculations of the sort, and Ralph's first\nmovement was to glance at Undine and see how it affected her. But her\neyes gave out the vivid rays that noise and banter always struck from\nthem; her face, at such moments, was like a theatre with all the lustres\nblazing. That the illumination should have been kindled by his cousin's\nhusband was not precisely agreeable to Marvell, who thought Peter a\nbore in society and an insufferable nuisance on closer terms. But he\nwas becoming blunted to Undine's lack of discrimination; and his own\ntreatment of Van Degen was always tempered by his sympathy for Clare.\n\nHe therefore listened with apparent good-humour to Peter's suggestion\nof an evening at a petit theatre with the Harvey Shallums, and joined in\nthe laugh with which Undine declared: \"Oh, Ralph won't go--he only\nlikes the theatres where they walk around in bathtowels and talk\npoetry.--Isn't that what you've just been seeing?\" she added, with a\nturn of the neck that shed her brightness on him.\n\n\"What? One of those five-barrelled shows at the Fran\u00c3\u00a7ais? Great Scott,\nRalph--no wonder your wife's pining for the Folies Berg\u00c3\u00a8re!\"\n\n\"She needn't, my dear fellow. We never interfere with each other's\nvices.\"\n\nPeter, unsolicited, was comfortably lighting a cigarette. \"Ah, there's\nthe secret of domestic happiness. Marry somebody who likes all the\nthings you don't, and make love to somebody who likes all the things you\ndo.\"\n\nUndine laughed appreciatively. \"Only it dooms poor Ralph to such awful\nfrumps. Can't you see the sort of woman who'd love his sort of play?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can see her fast enough--my wife loves 'em,\" said their visitor,\nrising with a grin; while Ralph threw, out: \"So don't waste your pity on\nme!\" and Undine's laugh had the slight note of asperity that the mention\nof Clare always elicited.\n\n\"To-morrow night, then, at Paillard's,\" Van Degen concluded. \"And about\nthe other business--that's a go too? I leave it to you to settle the\ndate.\"\n\nThe nod and laugh they exchanged seemed to hint at depths of collusion\nfrom which Ralph was pointedly excluded; and he wondered how large\na programme of pleasure they had already had time to sketch out. He\ndisliked the idea of Undine's being too frequently seen with Van Degen,\nwhose Parisian reputation was not fortified by the connections that\npropped it up in New York; but he did not want to interfere with her\npleasure, and he was still wondering what to say when, as the door\nclosed, she turned to him gaily.\n\n\"I'm so glad you've come! I've got some news for you.\" She laid a light\ntouch on his arm.\n\nTouch and tone were enough to disperse his anxieties, and he answered\nthat he was in luck to find her already in when he had supposed her\nengaged, over a Nouveau Luxe tea-table, in repairing the afternoon's\nravages.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't shop much--I didn't stay out long.\" She raised a kindling\nface to him. \"And what do you think I've been doing? While you were\nsitting in your stuffy old theatre, worrying about the money I was\nspending (oh, you needn't fib--I know you were!) I was saving you\nhundreds and thousands. I've saved you the price of our passage!\"\n\nRalph laughed in pure enjoyment of her beauty. When she shone on him\nlike that what did it matter what nonsense she talked?\n\n\"You wonderful woman--how did you do it? By countermanding a tiara?\"\n\n\"You know I'm not such a fool as you pretend!\" She held him at arm's\nlength with a nod of joyous mystery. \"You'll simply never guess! I've\nmade Peter Van Degen ask us to go home on the Sorceress. What. do you\nsay to that?\"\n\nShe flashed it out on a laugh of triumph, without appearing to have a\ndoubt of the effect the announcement would produce.\n\nRalph stared at her. \"The Sorceress? You MADE him?\"\n\n\"Well, I managed it, I worked him round to it! He's crazy about the idea\nnow--but I don't think he'd thought of it before he came.\"\n\n\"I should say not!\" Ralph ejaculated. \"He never would have had the cheek\nto think of it.\"\n\n\"Well, I've made him, anyhow! Did you ever know such luck?\"\n\n\"Such luck?\" He groaned at her obstinate innocence. \"Do you suppose I'll\nlet you cross the ocean on the Sorceress?\"\n\nShe shrugged impatiently. \"You say that because your cousin doesn't go\non her.\"\n\n\"If she doesn't, it's because it's no place for decent women.\"\n\n\"It's Clare's fault if it isn't. Everybody knows she's crazy about you,\nand she makes him feel it. That's why he takes up with other women.\"\n\nHer anger reddened her cheeks and dropped her brows like a black bar\nabove her glowing eyes. Even in his recoil from what she said Ralph felt\nthe tempestuous heat of her beauty. But for the first time his latent\nresentments rose in him, and he gave her back wrath for wrath.\n\n\"Is that the precious stuff he tells you?\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I had to wait for him to tell me? Everybody knows\nit--everybody in New York knew she was wild when you married. That's\nwhy she's always been so nasty to me. If you won't go on the Sorceress\nthey'll all say it's because she was jealous of me and wouldn't let\nyou.\"\n\nRalph's indignation had already flickered down to disgust. Undine was no\nlonger beautiful--she seemed to have the face of her thoughts. He stood\nup with an impatient laugh.\n\n\"Is that another of his arguments? I don't wonder they're convincing--\"\nBut as quickly as it had come the sneer dropped, yielding to a wave of\npity, the vague impulse to silence and protect her. How could he have\ngiven way to the provocation of her weakness, when his business was to\ndefend her from it and lift her above it? He recalled his old dreams of\nsaving her from Van Degenism--it was not thus that he had imagined the\nrescue.\n\n\"Don't let's pay Peter the compliment of squabbling over him,\" he said,\nturning away to pour himself a cup of tea.\n\nWhen he had filled his cup he sat down beside Undine, with a smile. \"No\ndoubt he was joking--and thought you were; but if you really made him\nbelieve we might go with him you'd better drop him a line.\"\n\nUndine's brow still gloomed. \"You refuse, then?\"\n\n\"Refuse? I don't need to! Do you want to succeed to half the\nchorus-world of New York?\"\n\n\"They won't be on board with us, I suppose!\"\n\n\"The echoes of their conversation will. It's the only language Peter\nknows.\"\n\n\"He told me he longed for the influence of a good woman--\" She checked\nherself, reddening at Ralph's laugh.\n\n\"Well, tell him to apply again when he's been under it a month or two.\nMeanwhile we'll stick to the liners.\"\n\nRalph was beginning to learn that the only road to her reason lay\nthrough her vanity, and he fancied that if she could be made to see\nVan Degen as an object of ridicule she might give up the idea of the\nSorceress of her own accord. But her will hardened slowly under his\njoking opposition, and she became no less formidable as she grew more\ncalm. He was used to women who, in such cases, yielded as a matter of\ncourse to masculine judgments: if one pronounced a man \"not decent\"\nthe question was closed. But it was Undine's habit to ascribe all\ninterference with her plans to personal motives, and he could see that\nshe attributed his opposition to the furtive machinations of poor\nClare. It was odious to him to prolong the discussion, for the accent\nof recrimination was the one he most dreaded on her lips. But the moment\ncame when he had to take the brunt of it, averting his thoughts as best\nhe might from the glimpse it gave of a world of mean familiarities, of\nreprisals drawn from the vulgarest of vocabularies. Certain retorts sped\nthrough the air like the flight of household utensils, certain charges\nrang out like accusations of tampering with the groceries. He stiffened\nhimself against such comparisons, but they stuck in his imagination and\nleft him thankful when Undine's anger yielded to a burst of tears. He\nhad held his own and gained his point. The trip on the Sorceress was\ngiven up, and a note of withdrawal despatched to Van Degen; but at the\nsame time Ralph cabled his sister to ask if she could increase her loan.\nFor he had conquered only at the cost of a concession: Undine was to\nstay in Paris till October, and they were to sail on a fast steamer, in\na deck-suite, like the Harvey Shallums.\n\nUndine's ill-humour was soon dispelled by any new distraction, and she\ngave herself to the untroubled enjoyment of Paris. The Shallums were the\ncentre of a like-minded group, and in the hours the ladies could spare\nfrom their dress-makers the restaurants shook with their hilarity\nand the suburbs with the shriek of their motors. Van Degen, who had\npostponed his sailing, was a frequent sharer in these amusements; but\nRalph counted on New York influences to detach him from Undine's train.\nHe was learning to influence her through her social instincts where he\nhad once tried to appeal to other sensibilities.\n\nHis worst moment came when he went to see Clare Van Degen, who, on the\neve of departure, had begged him to come to her hotel. He found her less\nrestless and rattling than usual, with a look in her eyes that reminded\nhim of the days when she had haunted his thoughts. The visit passed off\nwithout vain returns to the past; but as he was leaving she surprised\nhim by saying: \"Don't let Peter make a goose of your wife.\"\n\nRalph reddened, but laughed.\n\n\"Oh, Undine's wonderfully able to defend herself, even against such\nseductions as Peter's.\"\n\nMrs. Van Degen looked down with a smile at the bracelets on her thin\nbrown wrist. \"His personal seductions--yes. But as an inventor of\namusements he's inexhaustible; and Undine likes to be amused.\"\n\nRalph made no reply but showed no annoyance. He simply took her hand and\nkissed it as he said good-bye; and she turned from him without audible\nfarewell.\n\nAs the day of departure approached. Undine's absorption in her dresses\nalmost precluded the thought of amusement. Early and late she was\ncloseted with fitters and packers--even the competent Celeste not being\ntrusted to handle the treasures now pouring in--and Ralph cursed his\nweakness in not restraining her, and then fled for solace to museums and\ngalleries.\n\nHe could not rouse in her any scruple about incurring fresh debts, yet\nhe knew she was no longer unaware of the value of money. She had\nlearned to bargain, pare down prices, evade fees, brow-beat the small\ntradespeople and wheedle concessions from the great--not, as Ralph\nperceived, from any effort to restrain her expenses, but only to prolong\nand intensify the pleasure of spending. Pained by the trait, he tried\nto laugh her out of it. He told her once that she had a miserly\nhand--showing her, in proof, that, for all their softness, the fingers\nwould not bend back, or the pink palm open. But she retorted a little\nsharply that it was no wonder, since she'd heard nothing talked of since\ntheir marriage but economy; and this left him without any answer. So\nthe purveyors continued to mount to their apartment, and Ralph, in the\ncourse of his frequent nights from it, found himself always dodging the\ncorners of black glazed boxes and swaying pyramids of pasteboard; always\nlifting his hat to sidling milliners' girls, or effacing himself before\nslender vendeuses floating by in a mist of opopanax. He felt incompetent\nto pronounce on the needs to which these visitors ministered; but the\nreappearance among them of the blond-bearded jeweller gave him ground\nfor fresh fears. Undine had assured him that she had given up the idea\nof having her ornaments reset, and there had been ample time for their\nreturn; but on his questioning her she explained that there had been\ndelays and \"bothers\" and put him in the wrong by asking ironically if he\nsupposed she was buying things \"for pleasure\" when she knew as well as\nhe that there wasn't any money to pay for them.\n\nBut his thoughts were not all dark. Undine's moods still infected him,\nand when she was happy he felt an answering lightness. Even when\nher amusements were too primitive to be shared he could enjoy their\nreflection in her face. Only, as he looked back, he was struck by the\nevanescence, the lack of substance, in their moments of sympathy, and\nby the permanent marks left by each breach between them. Yet he still\nfancied that some day the balance might be reversed, and that as she\nacquired a finer sense of values the depths in her would find a voice.\n\nSomething of this was in his mind when, the afternoon before their\ndeparture, he came home to help her with their last arrangements. She\nhad begged him, for the day, to leave her alone in their cramped salon,\ninto which belated bundles were still pouring; and it was nearly dark\nwhen he returned. The evening before she had seemed pale and nervous,\nand at the last moment had excused herself from dining with the Shallums\nat a suburban restaurant. It was so unlike her to miss any opportunity\nof the kind that Ralph had felt a little anxious. But with the arrival\nof the packers she was afoot and in command again, and he withdrew\nsubmissively, as Mr. Spragg, in the early Apex days, might have fled\nfrom the spring storm of \"house-cleaning.\"\n\nWhen he entered the sitting-room, he found it still in disorder. Every\nchair was hidden under scattered dresses, tissue-paper surged from the\nyawning trunks and, prone among her heaped-up finery. Undine lay with\nclosed eyes on the sofa.\n\nShe raised her head as he entered, and then turned listlessly away.\n\n\"My poor girl, what's the matter? Haven't they finished yet?\"\n\nInstead of answering she pressed her face into the cushion and began to\nsob. The violence of her weeping shook her hair down on her shoulders,\nand her hands, clenching the arm of the sofa, pressed it away from her\nas if any contact were insufferable.\n\nRalph bent over her in alarm. \"Why, what's wrong, dear? What's\nhappened?\"\n\nHer fatigue of the previous evening came back to him--a puzzled hunted\nlook in her eyes; and with the memory a vague wonder revived. He had\nfancied himself fairly disencumbered of the stock formulas about the\nhallowing effects of motherhood, and there were many reasons for not\nwelcoming the news he suspected she had to give; but the woman a man\nloves is always a special case, and everything was different that befell\nUndine. If this was what had befallen her it was wonderful and divine:\nfor the moment that was all he felt.\n\n\"Dear, tell me what's the matter,\" he pleaded.\n\nShe sobbed on unheedingly and he waited for her agitation to subside. He\nshrank from the phrases considered appropriate to the situation, but\nhe wanted to hold her close and give her the depth of his heart in long\nkiss.\n\nSuddenly she sat upright and turned a desperate face on him. \"Why\non earth are you staring at me like that? Anybody can see what's the\nmatter!\"\n\nHe winced at her tone, but managed to get one of her hands in his; and\nthey stayed thus in silence, eye to eye.\n\n\"Are you as sorry as all that?\" he began at length conscious of the\nflatness of his voice.\n\n\"Sorry--sorry? I'm--I'm--\" She snatched her hand away, and went on\nweeping.\n\n\"But, Undine--dearest--bye and bye you'll feel differently--I know you\nwill!\"\n\n\"Differently? Differently? When? In a year? It TAKES a year--a whole\nyear out of life! What do I care how I shall feel in a year?\"\n\nThe chill of her tone struck in. This was more than a revolt of the\nnerves: it was a settled, a reasoned resentment. Ralph found himself\ngroping for extenuations, evasions--anything to put a little warmth into\nher! \"Who knows? Perhaps, after all, it's a mistake.\"\n\nThere was no answering light in her face. She turned her head from him\nwearily.\n\n\"Don't you think, dear, you may be mistaken?\"\n\n\"Mistaken? How on earth can I be mistaken?\"\n\nEven in that moment of confusion he was struck by the cold competence of\nher tone, and wondered how she could be so sure.\n\n\"You mean you've asked--you've consulted--?\" The irony of it took him\nby the throat. They were the very words he might have spoken in some\nmiserable secret colloquy--the words he was speaking to his wife!\n\nShe repeated dully: \"I know I'm not mistaken.\"\n\nThere was another long silence. Undine lay still, her eyes shut,\ndrumming on the arm of the sofa with a restless hand. The other lay\ncold in Ralph's clasp, and through it there gradually stole to him the\nbenumbing influence of the thoughts she was thinking: the sense of\nthe approach of illness, anxiety, and expense, and of the general\nunnecessary disorganization of their lives.\n\n\"That's all you feel, then?\" he asked at length a little bitterly, as if\nto disguise from himself the hateful fact that he felt it too. He stood\nup and moved away. \"That's all?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Why, what else do you expect me to feel? I feel horribly ill, if that's\nwhat you want.\" He saw the sobs trembling up through her again.\n\n\"Poor dear--poor girl...I'm so sorry--so dreadfully sorry!\"\n\nThe senseless reiteration seemed to exasperate her. He knew it by the\nquiver that ran through her like the premonitory ripple on smooth water\nbefore the coming of the wind. She turned about on him and jumped to her\nfeet.\n\n\"Sorry--you're sorry? YOU'RE sorry? Why, what earthly difference will it\nmake to YOU?\" She drew back a few steps and lifted her slender arms from\nher sides. \"Look at me--see how I look--how I'm going to look! YOU\nwon't hate yourself more and more every morning when you get up and see\nyourself in the glass! YOUR life's going on just as usual! But what's\nmine going to be for months and months? And just as I'd been to all this\nbother--fagging myself to death about all these things--\" her tragic\ngesture swept the disordered room--\"just as I thought I was going home\nto enjoy myself, and look nice, and see people again, and have a little\npleasure after all our worries--\" She dropped back on the sofa with\nanother burst of tears. \"For all the good this rubbish will do me now! I\nloathe the very sight of it!\" she sobbed with her face in her hands.\n\n\n\nXIV\n\nIt was one of the distinctions of Mr. Claud Walsingham Popple that his\nstudio was never too much encumbered with the attributes of his art\nto permit the installing, in one of its cushioned corners, of an\nelaborately furnished tea-table flanked by the most varied seductions in\nsandwiches and pastry.\n\nMr. Popple, like all great men, had at first had his ups and downs;\nbut his reputation had been permanently established by the verdict of\na wealthy patron who, returning from an excursion into other fields\nof portraiture, had given it as the final fruit of his experience that\nPopple was the only man who could \"do pearls.\" To sitters for whom this\nwas of the first consequence it was another of the artist's merits\nthat he always subordinated art to elegance, in life as well as in his\nportraits. The \"messy\" element of production was no more visible in\nhis expensively screened and tapestried studio than its results were\nperceptible in his painting; and it was often said, in praise of his\nwork, that he was the only artist who kept his studio tidy enough for a\nlady to sit to him in a new dress.\n\nMr. Popple, in fact, held that the personality of the artist should at\nall times be dissembled behind that of the man. It was his opinion that\nthe essence of good-breeding lay in tossing off a picture as easily as\nyou lit a cigarette. Ralph Marvell had once said of him that when he\nbegan a portrait he always turned back his cuffs and said: \"Ladies\nand gentlemen, you can see there's absolutely nothing here,\" and Mrs.\nFairford supplemented the description by defining his painting as\n\"chafing-dish\" art. On a certain late afternoon of December, some four\nyears after Mr. Popple's first meeting with Miss Undine Spragg of Apex,\neven the symbolic chafing-dish was nowhere visible in his studio; the\nonly evidence of its recent activity being the full-length portrait of\nMrs. Ralph Marvell, who, from her lofty easel and her heavily garlanded\nframe, faced the doorway with the air of having been invited to\n\"receive\" for Mr. Popple.\n\nThe artist himself, becomingly clad in mouse-coloured velveteen, had\njust turned away from the picture to hover above the tea-cups; but his\nplace had been taken by the considerably broader bulk of Mr. Peter Van\nDegen, who, tightly moulded into a coat of the latest cut, stood before\nthe portrait in the attitude of a first arrival.\n\n\"Yes, it's good--it's damn good, Popp; you've hit the hair off\nripplingly; but the pearls ain't big enough,\" he pronounced.\n\nA slight laugh sounded from the raised dais behind the easel.\n\n\"Of course they're not! But it's not HIS fault, poor man; HE didn't give\nthem to me!\" As she spoke Mrs. Ralph Marvell rose from a monumental gilt\narm-chair of pseudo-Venetian design and swept her long draperies to Van\nDegen's side.\n\n\"He might, then--for the privilege of painting you!\" the latter\nrejoined, transferring his bulging stare from the counterfeit to the\noriginal. His eyes rested on Mrs. Marvell's in what seemed a quick\nexchange of understanding; then they passed on to a critical inspection\nof her person. She was dressed for the sitting in something faint and\nshining, above which the long curves of her neck looked dead white in\nthe cold light of the studio; and her hair, all a shadowless rosy gold,\nwas starred with a hard glitter of diamonds.\n\n\"The privilege of painting me? Mercy, _I_ have to pay for being painted!\nHe'll tell you he's giving me the picture--but what do you suppose this\ncost?\" She laid a finger-tip on her shimmering dress.\n\nVan Degen's eye rested on her with cold enjoyment. \"Does the price come\nhigher than the dress?\"\n\nShe ignored the allusion. \"Of course what they charge for is the cut--\"\n\n\"What they cut away? That's what they ought to charge for, ain't it,\nPopp?\"\n\nUndine took this with cool disdain, but Mr. Popple's sensibilities were\noffended.\n\n\"My dear Peter--really--the artist, you understand, sees all this as a\npure question of colour, of pattern; and it's a point of honour with the\nMAN to steel himself against the personal seduction.\"\n\nMr. Van Degen received this protest with a sound of almost vulgar\nderision, but Undine thrilled agreeably under the glance which her\nportrayer cast on her. She was flattered by Van Degen's notice, and\nthought his impertinence witty; but she glowed inwardly at Mr. Popple's\neloquence. After more than three years of social experience she still\nthought he \"spoke beautifully,\" like the hero of a novel, and she\nascribed to jealousy the lack of seriousness with which her husband's\nfriends regarded him. His conversation struck her as intellectual, and\nhis eagerness to have her share his thoughts was in flattering contrast\nto Ralph's growing tendency to keep his to himself. Popple's homage\nseemed the, subtlest proof of what Ralph could have made of her if he\nhad \"really understood\" her. It was but another step to ascribe all her\npast mistakes to the lack of such understanding; and the satisfaction\nderived from this thought had once impelled her to tell the artist that\nhe alone knew how to rouse her 'higher self.' He had assured her that\nthe memory of her words would thereafter hallow his life; and as he\nhinted that it had been stained by the darkest errors she was moved at\nthe thought of the purifying influence she exerted.\n\nThus it was that a man should talk to a true woman--but how few whom\nshe had known possessed the secret! Ralph, in the first months of their\nmarriage, had been eloquent too, had even gone the length of quoting\npoetry; but he disconcerted her by his baffling twists and strange\nallusions (she always scented ridicule in the unknown), and the poets he\nquoted were esoteric and abstruse. Mr. Popple's rhetoric was drawn from\nmore familiar sources, and abounded in favourite phrases and in moving\nreminiscences of the Fifth Reader. He was moreover as literary as he\nwas artistic; possessing an unequalled acquaintance with contemporary\nfiction, and dipping even into the lighter type of memoirs, in which the\nold acquaintances of history are served up in the disguise of \"A Royal\nSorceress\" or \"Passion in a Palace.\" The mastery with which Mr.\nPopple discussed the novel of the day, especially in relation to\nthe sensibilities of its hero and heroine, gave Undine a sense of\nintellectual activity which contrasted strikingly with Marvell's\nflippant estimate of such works. \"Passion,\" the artist implied, would\nhave been the dominant note of his life, had it not been held in check\nby a sentiment of exalted chivalry, and by the sense that a nature of\nsuch emotional intensity as his must always be \"ridden on the curb.\"\n\nVan Degen was helping himself from the tray of iced cocktails which\nstood near the tea-table, and Popple, turning to Undine, took up the\nthread of his discourse. But why, he asked, why allude before others to\nfeelings so few could understand? The average man--lucky devil!--(with\na compassionate glance at Van Degen's back) the average man knew nothing\nof the fierce conflict between the lower and higher natures; and even\nthe woman whose eyes had kindled it--how much did SHE guess of its\nviolence? Did she know--Popple recklessly asked--how often the artist\nwas forgotten in the man--how often the man would take the bit between\nhis teeth, were it not that the look in her eyes recalled some sacred\nmemory, some lesson learned perhaps beside his mother's knee? \"I say,\nPopp--was that where you learned to mix this drink? Because it does the\nold lady credit,\" Van Degen called out, smacking his lips; while the\nartist, dashing a nervous hand through his hair, muttered: \"Hang it,\nPeter--is NOTHING sacred to you?\"\n\nIt pleased Undine to feel herself capable of inspiring such emotions.\nShe would have been fatigued by the necessity of maintaining her own\ntalk on Popple's level, but she liked to listen to him, and especially\nto have others overhear what he said to her.\n\nHer feeling for Van Degen was different. There was more similarity of\ntastes between them, though his manner flattered her vanity less than\nPopple's. She felt the strength of Van Degen's contempt for everything\nhe did not understand or could not buy: that was the only kind of\n\"exclusiveness\" that impressed her. And he was still to her, as in\nher inexperienced days, the master of the mundane science she had once\nimagined that Ralph Marvell possessed. During the three years since her\nmarriage she had learned to make distinctions unknown to her girlish\ncategories. She had found out that she had given herself to the\nexclusive and the dowdy when the future belonged to the showy and the\npromiscuous; that she was in the case of those who have cast in\ntheir lot with a fallen cause, or--to use an analogy more within her\nrange--who have hired an opera box on the wrong night. It was all\nconfusing and exasperating. Apex ideals had been based on the myth of\n\"old families\" ruling New York from a throne of Revolutionary tradition,\nwith the new millionaires paying them feudal allegiance. But experience\nhad long since proved the delusiveness of the simile. Mrs. Marvell's\nclassification of the world into the visited and the unvisited was as\nobsolete as a mediaeval cosmogony. Some of those whom Washington Square\nleft unvisited were the centre of social systems far outside its\nken, and as indifferent to its opinions as the constellations to the\nreckonings of the astronomers; and all these systems joyously revolved\nabout their central sun of gold.\n\nThere were moments after Undine's return to New York when she was\ntempted to class her marriage with the hateful early mistakes from the\nmemories of which she had hoped it would free her. Since it was never\nher habit to accuse herself of such mistakes it was inevitable that she\nshould gradually come to lay the blame on Ralph. She found a poignant\npleasure, at this stage of her career, in the question: \"What does a\nyoung girl know of life?\" And the poignancy was deepened by the fact\nthat each of the friends to whom she put the question seemed convinced\nthat--had the privilege been his--he would have known how to spare her\nthe disenchantment it implied.\n\nThe conviction of having blundered was never more present to her than\nwhen, on this particular afternoon, the guests invited by Mr. Popple to\nview her portrait began to assemble before it.\n\nSome of the principal figures of Undine's group had rallied for\nthe occasion, and almost all were in exasperating enjoyment of\nthe privileges for which she pined. There was young Jim Driscoll,\nheir-apparent of the house, with his short stout mistrustful wife, who\nhated society, but went everywhere lest it might be thought she had been\nleft out; the \"beautiful Mrs. Beringer,\" a lovely aimless being, who\nkept (as Laura Fairford said) a home for stray opinions, and could\nnever quite tell them apart; little Dicky Bowles, whom every one invited\nbecause he was understood to \"say things\" if one didn't; the Harvey\nShallums, fresh from Paris, and dragging in their wake a bewildered\nnobleman vaguely designated as \"the Count,\" who offered cautious\nconversational openings, like an explorer trying beads on savages; and,\nbehind these more salient types, the usual filling in of those who are\nseen everywhere because they have learned to catch the social eye.\n\nSuch a company was one to flatter the artist as much his sitter, so\ncompletely did it represent that unamity of opinion which constitutes\nsocial strength. Not one the number was troubled by any personal theory\nof art: all they asked of a portrait was that the costume should be\nsufficiently \"life-like,\" and the face not too much so; and a long\nexperience in idealizing flesh and realizing dress-fabrics had enabled\nMr. Popple to meet both demands.\n\n\"Hang it,\" Peter Van Degen pronounced, standing before the easel in\nan attitude of inspired interpretation, \"the great thing in a man's\nportrait is to catch the likeness--we all know that; but with a woman's\nit's different--a woman's picture has got to be pleasing. Who wants\nit about if it isn't? Those big chaps who blow about what they call\nrealism--how do THEIR portraits look in a drawing-room? Do you suppose\nthey ever ask themselves that? THEY don't care--they're not going to\nlive with the things! And what do they know of drawing-rooms, anyhow?\nLots of them haven't even got a dress-suit. There's where old Popp has\nthe pull over 'em--HE knows how we live and what we want.\"\n\nThis was received by the artist with a deprecating murmur, and by his\npublic with warm expressions of approval.\n\n\"Happily in this case,\" Popple began (\"as in that of so many of my\nsitters,\" he hastily put in), \"there has been no need to idealize-nature\nherself has outdone the artist's dream.\"\n\nUndine, radiantly challenging comparison with her portrait, glanced\nup at it with a smile of conscious merit, which deepened as young Jim\nDriscoll declared:\n\n\"By Jove, Mamie, you must be done exactly like that for the new\nmusic-room.\"\n\nHis wife turned a cautious eye upon the picture.\n\n\"How big is it? For our house it would have to be a good deal bigger,\"\nshe objected; and Popple, fired by the thought of such a dimensional\nopportunity, rejoined that it would be the chance of all others to.\n\"work in\" a marble portico and a court-train: he had just done Mrs.\nLycurgus Ambler in a court-train and feathers, and as THAT was for\nBuffalo of course the pictures needn't clash.\n\n\"Well, it would have to be a good deal bigger than Mrs. Ambler's,\" Mrs.\nDriscoll insisted; and on Popple's suggestion that in that case he might\n\"work in\" Driscoll, in court-dress also--(\"You've been presented? Well,\nyou WILL be,--you'll HAVE to, if I do the picture--which will make a\nlovely memento\")--Van Degen turned aside to murmur to Undine: \"Pure\nbluff, you know--Jim couldn't pay for a photograph. Old Driscoll's high\nand dry since the Ararat investigation.\"\n\nShe threw him a puzzled glance, having no time, in her crowded\nexistence, to follow the perturbations of Wall Street save as they\naffected the hospitality of Fifth Avenue.\n\n\"You mean they've lost their money? Won't they give their fancy ball,\nthen?\"\n\nVan Degen shrugged. \"Nobody knows how it's coming out That queer chap\nElmer Moffatt threatens to give old Driscoll a fancy ball--says he's\ngoing to dress him in stripes! It seems he knows too much about the Apex\nstreet-railways.\"\n\nUndine paled a little. Though she had already tried on her costume for\nthe Driscoll ball her disappointment at Van Degen's announcement was\neffaced by the mention of Moffatt's name. She had not had the curiosity\nto follow the reports of the \"Ararat Trust Investigation,\" but once\nor twice lately, in the snatches of smoking-room talk, she had been\nsurprised by a vague allusion to Elmer Moffatt, as to an erratic\nfinancial influence, half ridiculed, yet already half redoubtable. Was\nit possible that the redoubtable element had prevailed? That the time\nhad come when Elmer Moffatt--the Elmer Moffatt of Apex!--could, even for\na moment, cause consternation in the Driscoll camp? He had always said\nhe \"saw things big\"; but no one had ever believed he was destined to\ncarry them out on the same scale. Yet apparently in those idle Apex\ndays, while he seemed to be \"loafing and fooling,\" as her father called\nit, he had really been sharpening his weapons of aggression; there had\nbeen something, after all, in the effect of loose-drifting power she had\nalways felt in him. Her heart beat faster, and she longed to question\nVan Degen; but she was afraid of betraying herself, and turned back\nto the group about the picture. Mrs. Driscoll was still presenting\nobjections in a tone of small mild obstinacy. \"Oh, it's a LIKENESS, of\ncourse--I can see that; but there's one thing I must say, Mr. Popple. It\nlooks like a last year's dress.\"\n\nThe attention of the ladies instantly rallied to the picture, and the\nartist paled at the challenge.\n\n\"It doesn't look like a last year's face, anyhow--that's what makes them\nall wild,\" Van Degen murmured. Undine gave him back a quick smile. She\nhad already forgotten about Moffatt. Any triumph in which she shared\nleft a glow in her veins, and the success of the picture obscured all\nother impressions. She saw herself throning in a central panel at the\nspring exhibition, with the crowd pushing about the picture, repeating\nher name; and she decided to stop on the way home and telephone her\npress-agent to do a paragraph about Popple's tea.\n\nBut in the hall, as she drew on her cloak, her thoughts reverted to the\nDriscoll fancy ball. What a blow if it were given up after she had taken\nso much trouble about her dress! She was to go as the Empress Josephine,\nafter the Prudhon portrait in the Louvre. The dress was already fitted\nand partly embroidered, and she foresaw the difficulty of persuading the\ndress-maker to take it back.\n\n\"Why so pale and sad, fair cousin? What's up?\" Van Degen asked, as they\nemerged from the lift in which they had descended alone from the studio.\n\n\"I don't know--I'm tired of posing. And it was so frightfully hot.\"\n\n\"Yes. Popple always keeps his place at low-neck temperature, as if the\nportraits might catch cold.\" Van Degen glanced at his watch. \"Where are\nyou off to?\"\n\n\"West End Avenue, of course--if I can find a cab to take me there.\"\n\nIt was not the least of Undine's grievances that she was still living\nin the house which represented Mr. Spragg's first real-estate venture in\nNew York. It had been understood, at the time of her marriage, that\nthe young couple were to be established within the sacred precincts of\nfashion; but on their return from the honeymoon the still untenanted\nhouse in West End Avenue had been placed at their disposal, and in view\nof Mr. Spragg's financial embarrassment even Undine had seen the folly\nof refusing it. That first winter, more-over, she had not regretted her\nexile: while she awaited her boy's birth she was glad to be out of sight\nof Fifth Avenue, and to take her hateful compulsory exercise where no\nfamiliar eye could fall on her. And the next year of course her father\nwould give them a better house.\n\nBut the next year rents had risen in the Fifth Avenue quarter, and\nmeanwhile little Paul Marvell, from his beautiful pink cradle, was\nalready interfering with his mother's plans. Ralph, alarmed by the\nfresh rush of expenses, sided with his father-in-law in urging Undine\nto resign herself to West End Avenue; and thus after three years she\nwas still submitting to the incessant pin-pricks inflicted by the\nincongruity between her social and geographical situation--the need\nof having to give a west side address to her tradesmen, and the deeper\nirritation of hearing her friends say: \"Do let me give you a lift home,\ndear--Oh, I'd forgotten! I'm afraid I haven't the time to go so far--\"\n\nIt was bad enough to have no motor of her own, to be avowedly dependent\non \"lifts,\" openly and unconcealably in quest of them, and perpetually\nplotting to provoke their offer (she did so hate to be seen in a cab!)\nbut to miss them, as often as not, because of the remoteness of her\ndestination, emphasized the hateful sense of being \"out of things.\"\n\nVan Degen looked out at the long snow-piled streets, down which the\nlamps were beginning to put their dreary yellow splashes.\n\n\"Of course you won't get a cab on a night like this. If you don't mind\nthe open car, you'd better jump in with me. I'll run you out to the High\nBridge and give you a breath of air before dinner.\"\n\nThe offer was tempting, for Undine's triumph in the studio had left her\ntired and nervous--she was beginning to learn that success may be as\nfatiguing as failure. Moreover, she was going to a big dinner that\nevening, and the fresh air would give her the eyes and complexion she\nneeded; but in the back of her mind there lingered the vague sense of\na forgotten engagement. As she tried to recall it she felt Van Degen\nraising the fur collar about her chin.\n\n\"Got anything you can put over your head? Will that lace thing do? Come\nalong, then.\" He pushed her through the swinging doors, and added with a\nlaugh, as they reached the street: \"You're not afraid of being seen with\nme, are you? It's all right at this hour--Ralph's still swinging on a\nstrap in the elevated.\"\n\nThe winter twilight was deliriously cold, and as they swept through\nCentral Park, and gathered impetus for their northward flight along the\ndarkening Boulevard, Undine felt the rush of physical joy that drowns\nscruples and silences memory. Her scruples, indeed, were not serious;\nbut Ralph disliked her being too much with Van Degen, and it was her way\nto get what she wanted with as little \"fuss\" as possible. Moreover, she\nknew it was a mistake to make herself too accessible to a man of Peter's\nsort: her impatience to enjoy was curbed by an instinct for holding\noff and biding her time that resembled the patient skill with which her\nfather had conducted the sale of his \"bad\" real estate in the Pure Water\nMove days. But now and then youth had its way--she could not always\nresist the present pleasure. And it was amusing, too, to be \"talked\nabout\" with Peter Van Degen, who was noted for not caring for \"nice\nwomen.\" She enjoyed the thought of triumphing over meretricious charms:\nit ennobled her in her own eyes to influence such a man for good.\n\nNevertheless, as the motor flew on through the icy twilight, her present\ncares flew with it. She could not shake off the thought of the useless\nfancy dress which symbolized the other crowding expenses she had\nnot dared confess to Ralph. Van Degen heard her sigh, and bent down,\nlowering the speed of the motor.\n\n\"What's the matter? Isn't everything all right?\"\n\nHis tone made her suddenly feel that she could confide in him, and\nthough she began by murmuring that it was nothing she did so with the\nconscious purpose of being persuaded to confess. And his extraordinary\n\"niceness\" seemed to justify her and to prove that she had been right in\ntrusting her instinct rather than in following the counsels of prudence.\nHeretofore, in their talks, she had never gone beyond the vaguest hint\nof material \"bothers\"--as to which dissimulation seemed vain while one\nlived in West End Avenue! But now that the avowal of a definite worry\nhad been wrung from her she felt the injustice of the view generally\ntaken of poor Peter. For he had been neither too enterprising nor too\ncautious (though people said of him that he \"didn't care to part\"); he\nhad just laughed away, in bluff brotherly fashion, the gnawing thought\nof the fancy dress, had assured her he'd give a ball himself rather\nthan miss seeing her wear it, and had added: \"Oh, hang waiting for the\nbill--won't a couple of thou make it all right?\" in a tone that showed\nwhat a small matter money was to any one who took the larger view of\nlife.\n\nThe whole incident passed off so quickly and easily that within a few\nminutes she had settled down--with a nod for his \"Everything jolly again\nnow?\"--to untroubled enjoyment of the hour. Peace of mind, she said to\nherself, was all she needed to make her happy--and that was just what\nRalph had never given her! At the thought his face seemed to rise before\nher, with the sharp lines of care between the eyes: it was almost like a\npart of his \"nagging\" that he should thrust himself in at such a moment!\nShe tried to shut her eyes to the face; but a moment later it was\nreplaced by another, a small odd likeness of itself; and with a cry of\ncompunction she started up from her furs.\n\n\"Mercy! It's the boy's birthday--I was to take him to his grandmother's.\nShe was to have a cake for him and Ralph was to come up town. I KNEW\nthere was something I'd forgotten!\"\n\n\n\nXV\n\nIn the Dagonet drawing-room the lamps had long been lit, and Mrs.\nFairford, after a last impatient turn, had put aside the curtains of\nworn damask to strain her eyes into the darkening square. She came\nback to the hearth, where Charles Bowen stood leaning between the prim\ncaryatides of the white marble chimney-piece.\n\n\"No sign of her. She's simply forgotten.\"\n\nBowen looked at his watch, and turned to compare it with the\nhigh-waisted Empire clock.\n\n\"Six o'clock. Why not telephone again? There must be some mistake.\nPerhaps she knew Ralph would be late.\"\n\nLaura laughed. \"I haven't noticed that she follows Ralph's movements\nso closely. When I telephoned just now the servant said she'd been out\nsince two. The nurse waited till half-past four, not liking to come\nwithout orders; and now it's too late for Paul to come.\"\n\nShe wandered away toward the farther end of the room, where,\nthrough half-open doors, a shining surface of mahogany reflected a\nflower-wreathed cake in which two candles dwindled.\n\n\"Put them out, please,\" she said to some one in the background; then she\nshut the doors and turned back to Bowen.\n\n\"It's all so unlucky--my grandfather giving up his drive, and mother\nbacking out of her hospital meeting, and having all the committee down\non her. And Henley: I'd even coaxed Henley away from his bridge! He\nescaped again just before you came. Undine promised she'd have the boy\nhere at four. It's not as if it had never happened before. She's always\nbreaking her engagements.\"\n\n\"She has so many that it's inevitable some should get broken.\"\n\n\"All if she'd only choose! Now that Ralph has had into business, and\nis kept in his office so late, it's cruel of her to drag him out every\nnight. He told us the other day they hadn't dined at home for a month.\nUndine doesn't seem to notice how hard he works.\"\n\nBowen gazed meditatively at the crumbling fire. \"No--why should she?\"\n\n\"Why SHOULD she? Really, Charles--!\"\n\n\"Why should she, when she knows nothing about it?\"\n\n\"She may know nothing about his business; but she must know it's her\nextravagance that's forced him into it.\" Mrs. Fairford looked at Bowen\nreproachfully. \"You talk as if you were on her side!\"\n\n\"Are there sides already? If so, I want to look down on them impartially\nfrom the heights of pure speculation. I want to get a general view of\nthe whole problem of American marriages.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford dropped into her arm-chair with a sigh. \"If that's what\nyou want you must make haste! Most of them don't last long enough to be\nclassified.\"\n\n\"I grant you it takes an active mind. But the weak point is so\nfrequently the same that after a time one knows where to look for it.\"\n\n\"What do you call the weak point?\"\n\nHe paused. \"The fact that the average American looks down on his wife.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford was up with a spring. \"If that's where paradox lands you!\"\n\nBowen mildly stood his ground. \"Well--doesn't he prove it? How much does\nhe let her share in the real business of life? How much does he rely on\nher judgment and help in the conduct of serious affairs? Take Ralph for\ninstance--you say his wife's extravagance forces him to work too hard;\nbut that's not what's wrong. It's normal for a man to work hard for a\nwoman--what's abnormal is his not caring to tell her anything about it.\"\n\n\"To tell Undine? She'd be bored to death if he did!\"\n\n\"Just so; she'd even feel aggrieved. But why? Because it's against the\ncustom of the country. And whose fault is that? The man's again--I don't\nmean Ralph I mean the genus he belongs to: homo sapiens, Americanus.\nWhy haven't we taught our women to take an interest in our work? Simply\nbecause we don't take enough interest in THEM.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford, sinking back into her chair, sat gazing at the\nvertiginous depths above which his thought seemed to dangle her.\n\n\"YOU don't? The American man doesn't--the most slaving, self-effacing,\nself-sacrificing--?\"\n\n\"Yes; and the most indifferent: there's the point. The 'slaving's' no\nargument against the indifference To slave for women is part of the old\nAmerican tradition; lots of people give their lives for dogmas they've\nceased to believe in. Then again, in this country the passion for making\nmoney has preceded the knowing how to spend it, and the American man\nlavishes his fortune on his wife because he doesn't know what else to do\nwith it.\"\n\n\"Then you call it a mere want of imagination for a man to spend his\nmoney on his wife?\"\n\n\"Not necessarily--but it's a want of imagination to fancy it's all\nhe owes her. Look about you and you'll see what I mean. Why does the\nEuropean woman interest herself so much more in what the men are doing?\nBecause she's so important to them that they make it worth her while!\nShe's not a parenthesis, as she is here--she's in the very middle of the\npicture. I'm not implying that Ralph isn't interested in his wife--he's\na passionate, a pathetic exception. But even he has to conform to an\nenvironment where all the romantic values are reversed. Where does the\nreal life of most American men lie? In some woman's drawing-room or in\ntheir offices? The answer's obvious, isn't it? The emotional centre of\ngravity's not the same in the two hemispheres. In the effete societies\nit's love, in our new one it's business. In America the real crime\npassionnel is a 'big steal'--there's more excitement in wrecking\nrailways than homes.\"\n\nBowen paused to light another cigarette, and then took up his theme.\n\"Isn't that the key to our easy divorces? If we cared for women in the\nold barbarous possessive way do you suppose we'd give them up as\nreadily as we do? The real paradox is the fact that the men who make,\nmaterially, the biggest sacrifices for their women, should do least for\nthem ideally and romantically. And what's the result--how do the women\navenge themselves? All my sympathy's with them, poor deluded dears, when\nI see their fallacious little attempt to trick out the leavings\ntossed them by the preoccupied male--the money and the motors and the\nclothes--and pretend to themselves and each other that THAT'S what\nreally constitutes life! Oh, I know what you're going to say--it's less\nand less of a pretense with them, I grant you; they're more and more\nsuccumbing to the force of the suggestion; but here and there I fancy\nthere's one who still sees through the humbug, and knows that money and\nmotors and clothes are simply the big bribe she's paid for keeping out\nof some man's way!\"\n\nMrs. Fairford presented an amazed silence to the rush of this tirade;\nbut when she rallied it was to murmur: \"And is Undine one of the\nexceptions?\"\n\nHer companion took the shot with a smile. \"No--she's a monstrously\nperfect result of the system: the completest proof of its triumph. It's\nRalph who's the victim and the exception.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor Ralph!\" Mrs. Fairford raised her head quickly. \"I hear him\nnow. I suppose,\" she added in an undertone, \"we can't give him your\nexplanation for his wife's having forgotten to come?\"\n\nBowen echoed her sigh, and then seemed to toss it from him with his\ncigarette-end; but he stood in silence while the door opened and Ralph\nMarvell entered.\n\n\"Well, Laura! Hallo, Charles--have you been celebrating too?\" Ralph\nturned to his sister. \"It's outrageous of me to be so late, and\nI daren't look my son in the face! But I stayed down town to make\nprovision for his future birthdays.\" He returned Mrs. Fairford's kiss.\n\"Don't tell me the party's over, and the guest of honour gone to bed?\"\n\nAs he stood before them, laughing and a little flushed, the strain of\nlong fatigue sounding through his gaiety and looking out of his anxious\neyes, Mrs. Fairford threw a glance at Bowen and then turned away to ring\nthe bell.\n\n\"Sit down, Ralph--you look tired. I'll give you some tea.\"\n\nHe dropped into an arm-chair. \"I did have rather a rush to get here--but\nhadn't I better join the revellers? Where are they?\"\n\nHe walked to the end of the room and threw open the dining-room doors.\n\"Hallo--where have they all gone to? What a jolly cake!\" He went up to\nit. \"Why, it's never even been cut!\"\n\nMrs. Fairford called after him: \"Come and have your tea first.\"\n\n\"No, no--tea afterward, thanks. Are they all upstairs with my\ngrandfather? I must make my peace with Undine--\" His sister put her arm\nthrough his, and drew him back to the fire.\n\n\"Undine didn't come.\"\n\n\"Didn't come? Who brought the boy, then?\"\n\n\"He didn't come either. That's why the cake's not cut.\"\n\nRalph frowned. \"What's the mystery? Is he ill, or what's happened?\"\n\n\"Nothing's happened--Paul's all right. Apparently Undine forgot. She\nnever went home for him, and the nurse waited till it was too late to\ncome.\"\n\nShe saw his eyes darken; but he merely gave a slight laugh and drew out\nhis cigarette case. \"Poor little Paul--poor chap!\" He moved toward the\nfire. \"Yes, please--some tea.\"\n\nHe dropped back into his chair with a look of weariness, as if some\nstrong stimulant had suddenly ceased to take effect on him; but before\nthe tea-table was brought back he had glanced at his watch and was on\nhis feet again.\n\n\"But this won't do. I must rush home and see the poor chap before\ndinner. And my mother--and my grandfather? I want to say a word to\nthem--I must make Paul's excuses!\"\n\n\"Grandfather's taking his nap. And mother had to rush out for a\npostponed committee meeting--she left as soon as we heard Paul wasn't\ncoming.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see.\" He sat down again. \"Yes, make the strong, please. I've had\na beastly fagging sort of day.\"\n\nHe leaned back with half-closed eyes, his untouched cup in his hand.\nBowen took leave, and Laura sat silent, watching her brother under\nlowered lids while she feigned to be busy with the kettle. Ralph\npresently emptied his cup and put it aside; then, sinking into his\nformer attitude, he clasped his hands behind his head and lay staring\napathetically into the fire. But suddenly he came to life and started\nup. A motor-horn had sounded outside, and there was a noise of wheels at\nthe door.\n\n\"There's Undine! I wonder what could have kept her.\" He jumped up and\nwalked to the door; but it was Clare Van Degen who came in. At sight of\nhim she gave a little murmur of pleasure. \"What luck to find you! No,\nnot luck--I came because I knew you'd be here. He never comes near me,\nLaura: I have to hunt him down to get a glimpse of him!\"\n\nSlender and shadowy in her long furs, she bent to kiss Mrs. Fairford and\nthen turned back to Ralph. \"Yes, I knew I'd catch you here. I knew\nit was the boy's birthday, and I've brought him a present: a vulgar\nexpensive Van Degen offering. I've not enough imagination left to find\nthe right thing, the thing it takes feeling and not money to buy. When I\nlook for a present nowadays I never say to the shopman: 'I want this or\nthat'--I simply say: 'Give me something that costs so much.'\"\n\nShe drew a parcel from her muff. \"Where's the victim of my vulgarity?\nLet me crush him under the weight of my gold.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford sighed out \"Clare--Clare!\" and Ralph smiled at his cousin.\n\n\"I'm sorry; but you'll have to depute me to present it. The birthday's\nover; you're too late.\"\n\nShe looked surprised. \"Why, I've just left Mamie Driscoll, and she\ntold me Undine was still at Popple's studio a few minutes ago: Popple's\ngiving a tea to show the picture.\"\n\n\"Popple's giving a tea?\" Ralph struck an attitude of mock consternation.\n\"Ah, in that case--! In Popple's society who wouldn't forget the flight\nof time?\"\n\nHe had recovered his usual easy tone, and Laura sat that Mrs. Van\nDegen's words had dispelled his preoccupation. He turned to his cousin.\n\"Will you trust me with your present for the boy?\"\n\nClare gave him the parcel. \"I'm sorry not to give it myself. I said what\nI did because I knew what you and Laura were thinking--but it's really\na battered old Dagonet bowl that came down to me from our revered\ngreat-grandmother.\"\n\n\"What--the heirloom you used to eat your porridge out of?\" Ralph\ndetained her hand to put a kiss on it. \"That's dear of you!\"\n\nShe threw him one of her strange glances. \"Why not say: 'That's like\nyou?' But you don't remember what I'm like.\" She turned away to glance\nat the clock. \"It's late, and I must be off. I'm going to a big dinner\nat the Chauncey Ellings'--but you must be going there too, Ralph? You'd\nbetter let me drive you home.\"\n\nIn the motor Ralph leaned back in silence, while the rug was drawn\nover their knees, and Clare restlessly fingered the row of gold-topped\nobjects in the rack at her elbow. It was restful to be swept through the\ncrowded streets in this smooth fashion, and Clare's presence at his side\ngave him a vague sense of ease.\n\nFor a long time now feminine nearness had come to mean to him, not\nthis relief from tension, but the ever-renewed dread of small daily\ndeceptions, evasions, subterfuges. The change had come gradually, marked\nby one disillusionment after another; but there had been one moment that\nformed the point beyond which there was no returning. It was the moment,\na month or two before his boy's birth, when, glancing over a batch of\nbelated Paris bills, he had come on one from the jeweller he had once\nfound in private conference with Undine. The bill was not large, but two\nof its items stood out sharply. \"Resetting pearl and diamond pendant.\nResetting sapphire and diamond ring.\" The pearl and diamond pendant was\nhis mother's wedding present; the ring was the one he had given Undine\non their engagement. That they were both family relics, kept unchanged\nthrough several generations, scarcely mattered to him at the time: he\nfelt only the stab of his wife's deception. She had assured him in Paris\nthat she had not had her jewels reset. He had noticed, soon after their\nreturn to New York, that she had left off her engagement-ring; but the\nothers were soon discarded also, and in answer to his question she had\ntold him that, in her ailing state, rings \"worried\" her. Now he saw she\nhad deceived him, and, forgetting everything else, he went to her, bill\nin hand. Her tears and distress filled him with immediate contrition.\nWas this a time to torment her about trifles? His anger seemed to\ncause her actual physical fear, and at the sight he abased himself in\nentreaties for forgiveness. When the scene ended she had pardoned him,\nand the reset ring was on her finger...\n\nSoon afterward, the birth of the boy seemed to wipe out these\nhumiliating memories; yet Marvell found in time that they were not\neffaced, but only momentarily crowded out of sight. In reality, the\nincident had a meaning out of proportion to its apparent seriousness,\nfor it put in his hand a clue to a new side of his wife's character. He\nno longer minded her having lied about the jeweller; what pained him was\nthat she had been unconscious of the wound she inflicted in destroying\nthe identity of the jewels. He saw that, even after their explanation,\nshe still supposed he was angry only because she had deceived him; and\nthe discovery that she was completely unconscious of states of feeling\non which so much of his inner life depended marked a new stage in their\nrelation. He was not thinking of all this as he sat beside Clare Van\nDegen; but it was part of the chronic disquietude which made him more\nalive to his cousin's sympathy, her shy unspoken understanding. After\nall, he and she were of the same blood and had the same traditions. She\nwas light and frivolous, without strength of will or depth of purpose;\nbut she had the frankness of her foibles, and she would never have lied\nto him or traded on his tenderness.\n\nClare's nervousness gradually subsided, and she lapsed into a low-voiced\nmood which seemed like an answer to his secret thought. But she did not\nsound the personal note, and they chatted quietly of commonplace things:\nof the dinner-dance at which they were presently to meet, of the costume\nshe had chosen for the Driscoll fancy-ball, the recurring rumours of old\nDriscoll's financial embarrassment, and the mysterious personality of\nElmer Moffatt, on whose movements Wall Street was beginning to fix a\nfascinated eye. When Ralph, the year after his marriage, had renounced\nhis profession to go into partnership with a firm of real-estate agents,\nhe had come in contact for the first time with the drama of \"business,\"\nand whenever he could turn his attention from his own tasks he found a\ncertain interest in watching the fierce interplay of its forces. In the\ndown-town world he had heard things of Moffatt that seemed to single him\nout from the common herd of money-makers: anecdotes of his coolness, his\nlazy good-temper, the humorous detachment he preserved in the heat of\nconflicting interests; and his figure was enlarged by the mystery that\nhung about it--the fact that no one seemed to know whence he came, or\nhow he had acquired the information which, for the moment, was making\nhim so formidable. \"I should like to see him,\" Ralph said; \"he must be a\ngood specimen of the one of the few picturesque types we've got.\"\n\n\"Yes--it might be amusing to fish him out; but the most picturesque\ntypes in Wall Street are generally the tamest in a drawing-room.\" Clare\nconsidered. \"But doesn't Undine know him? I seem to remember seeing them\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Undine and Moffatt? Then you KNOW him--you've' met him?\"\n\n\"Not actually met him--but he's been pointed out to me. It must have\nbeen some years ago. Yes--it was one night at the theatre, just after\nyou announced your engagement.\" He fancied her voice trembled slightly,\nas though she thought he might notice her way of dating her memories.\n\"You came into our box,\" she went on, \"and I asked you the name of the\nred-faced man who was sitting in the stall next to Undine. You didn't\nknow, but some one told us it was Moffatt.\"\n\nMarvell was more struck by her tone than by what she was saying.\n\"If Undine knows him it's odd she's never mentioned it,\" he answered\nindifferently.\n\nThe motor stopped at his door and Clare, as she held out her hand,\nturned a first full look on him.\n\n\"Why do you never come to see me? I miss you more than ever,\" she said.\n\nHe pressed her hand without answering, but after the motor had rolled\naway he stood for a while on the pavement, looking after it.\n\nWhen he entered the house the hall was still dark and the small\nover-furnished drawing-room empty. The parlour-maid told him that Mrs.\nMarvell had not yet come in, and he went upstairs to the nursery. But on\nthe threshold the nurse met him with the whispered request not to make\na noise, as it had been hard to quiet the boy after the afternoon's\ndisappointment, and she had just succeeded in putting him to sleep.\nRalph went down to his own room and threw himself in the old college\narm-chair in which, four years previously, he had sat the night out,\ndreaming of Undine. He had no study of his own, and he had crowded into\nhis narrow bed-room his prints and bookshelves, and the other relics of\nhis youth. As he sat among them now the memory of that other night swept\nover him--the night when he had heard the \"call\"! Fool as he had been\nnot to recognize its meaning then, he knew himself triply mocked in\nbeing, even now, at its mercy. The flame of love that had played\nabout his passion for his wife had died down to its embers; all the\ntransfiguring hopes and illusions were gone, but they had left an\nunquenchable ache for her nearness, her smile, her touch. His life\nhad come to be nothing but a long effort to win these mercies by one\nconcession after another: the sacrifice of his literary projects,\nthe exchange of his profession for an uncongenial business, and the\nincessant struggle to make enough money to satisfy her increasing\nexactions. That was where the \"call\" had led him... The clock struck\neight, but it was useless to begin to dress till Undine came in, and he\nstretched himself out in his chair, reached for a pipe and took up the\nevening paper. His passing annoyance had died out; he was usually too\ntired after his day's work for such feelings to keep their edge long.\nBut he was curious--disinterestedly curious--to know what pretext Undine\nwould invent for being so late, and what excuse she would have found for\nforgetting the little boy's birthday.\n\nHe read on till half-past eight; then he stood up and sauntered to the\nwindow. The avenue below it was deserted; not a carriage or motor turned\nthe corner around which he expected Undine to appear, and he looked idly\nin the opposite direction. There too the perspective was nearly empty,\nso empty that he singled out, a dozen blocks away, the blazing lamps\nof a large touring-car that was bearing furiously down the avenue from\nMorningside. As it drew nearer its speed slackened, and he saw it\nhug the curb and stop at his door. By the light of the street lamp he\nrecognized his wife as she sprang out and detected a familiar silhouette\nin her companion's fur-coated figure. Then the motor flew on and Undine\nran up the steps. Ralph went out on the landing. He saw her coming up\nquickly, as if to reach her room unperceived; but when she caught sight\nof him she stopped, her head thrown back and the light falling on her\nblown hair and glowing face.\n\n\"Well?\" she said, smiling up at him.\n\n\"They waited for you all the afternoon in Washington Square--the boy\nnever had his birthday,\" he answered.\n\nHer colour deepened, but she instantly rejoined: \"Why, what happened?\nWhy didn't the nurse take him?\"\n\n\"You said you were coming to fetch him, so she waited.\"\n\n\"But I telephoned--\"\n\nHe said to himself: \"Is THAT the lie?\" and answered: \"Where from?\"\n\n\"Why, the studio, of course--\" She flung her cloak open, as if to attest\nher veracity. \"The sitting lasted longer than usual--there was something\nabout the dress he couldn't get--\"\n\n\"But I thought he was giving a tea.\"\n\n\"He had tea afterward; he always does. And he asked some people in to\nsee my portrait. That detained me too. I didn't know they were coming,\nand when they turned up I couldn't rush away. It would have looked as\nif I didn't like the picture.\" She paused and they gave each other a\nsearching simultaneous glance. \"Who told you it was a tea?\" she asked.\n\n\"Clare Van Degen. I saw her at my mother's.\"\n\n\"So you weren't unconsoled after all--!\"\n\n\"The nurse didn't get any message. My people were awfully disappointed;\nand the poor boy has cried his eyes out.\"\n\n\"Dear me! What a fuss! But I might have known my message wouldn't be\ndelivered. Everything always happens to put me in the wrong with your\nfamily.\"\n\nWith a little air of injured pride she started to go to her room; but he\nput out a hand to detain her.\n\n\"You've just come from the studio?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is awfully late? I must go and dress. We're dining with the\nEllings, you know.\"\n\n\"I know... How did you come? In a cab?\"\n\nShe faced him limpidly. \"No; I couldn't find one that would bring me--so\nPeter gave me a lift, like an angel. I'm blown to bits. He had his open\ncar.\"\n\nHer colour was still high, and Ralph noticed that her lower lip twitched\na little. He had led her to the point they had reached solely to be able\nto say: \"If you're straight from the studio, how was it that I saw you\ncoming down from Morningside?\"\n\nUnless he asked her that there would be no point in his\ncross-questioning, and he would have sacrificed his pride without\na purpose. But suddenly, as they stood there face to face, almost\ntouching, she became something immeasurably alien and far off, and the\nquestion died on his lips.\n\n\"Is that all?\" she asked with a slight smile.\n\n\"Yes; you'd better go and dress,\" he said, and turned back to his room.\n\n\n\nXVI\n\nThe turnings of life seldom show a sign-post; or rather, though the\nsign is always there, it is usually placed some distance back, like the\nnotices that give warning of a bad hill or a level railway-crossing.\n\nRalph Marvell, pondering upon this, reflected that for him the sign had\nbeen set, more than three years earlier, in an Italian ilex-grove. That\nday his life had brimmed over--so he had put it at the time. He saw now\nthat it had brimmed over indeed: brimmed to the extent of leaving the\ncup empty, or at least of uncovering the dregs beneath the nectar. He\nknew now that he should never hereafter look at his wife's hand without\nremembering something he had read in it that day. Its surface-language\nhad been sweet enough, but under the rosy lines he had seen the warning\nletters.\n\nSince then he had been walking with a ghost: the miserable ghost of his\nillusion. Only he had somehow vivified, coloured, substantiated it, by\nthe force of his own great need--as a man might breathe a semblance of\nlife into a dear drowned body that he cannot give up for dead. All this\ncame to him with aching distinctness the morning after his talk with his\nwife on the stairs. He had accused himself, in midnight retrospect, of\nhaving failed to press home his conclusion because he dared not face\nthe truth. But he knew this was not the case. It was not the truth he\nfeared, it was another lie. If he had foreseen a chance of her saying:\n\"Yes, I was with Peter Van Degen, and for the reason you think,\" he\nwould have put it to the touch, stood up to the blow like a man; but\nhe knew she would never say that. She would go on eluding and doubling,\nwatching him as he watched her; and at that game she was sure to beat\nhim in the end.\n\nOn their way home from the Elling dinner this certainty had become so\ninsufferable that it nearly escaped him in the cry: \"You needn't watch\nme--I shall never again watch you!\" But he had held his peace, knowing\nshe would not understand. How little, indeed, she ever understood,\nhad been made clear to him when, the same night, he had followed her\nupstairs through the sleeping house. She had gone on ahead while he\nstayed below to lock doors and put out lights, and he had supposed her\nto be already in her room when he reached the upper landing; but she\nstood there waiting in the spot where he had waited for her a few hours\nearlier. She had shone her vividest at dinner, with revolving brilliancy\nthat collective approval always struck from her; and the glow of it\nstill hung on her as she paused there in the dimness, her shining cloak\ndropped from her white shoulders.\n\n\"Ralphie--\" she began, a soft hand on his arm. He stopped, and she\npulled him about so that their faces were close, and he saw her lips\ncurving for a kiss. Every line of her face sought him, from the sweep of\nthe narrowed eyelids to the dimples that played away from her smile. His\neye received the picture with distinctness; but for the first time it\ndid not pass into his veins. It was as if he had been struck with a\nsubtle blindness that permitted images to give their colour to the eye\nbut communicated nothing to the brain.\n\n\"Good-night,\" he said, as he passed on.\n\nWhen a man felt in that way about a woman he was surely in a position to\ndeal with his case impartially. This came to Ralph as the joyless solace\nof the morning. At last the bandage was off and he could see. And what\ndid he see? Only the uselessness of driving his wife to subterfuges that\nwere no longer necessary. Was Van Degen her lover? Probably not--the\nsuspicion died as it rose. She would not take more risks than she could\nhelp, and it was admiration, not love, that she wanted. She wanted\nto enjoy herself, and her conception of enjoyment was publicity,\npromiscuity--the band, the banners, the crowd, the close contact of\ncovetous impulses, and the sense of walking among them in cool security.\nAny personal entanglement might mean \"bother,\" and bother was the thing\nshe most abhorred. Probably, as the queer formula went, his \"honour\"\nwas safe: he could count on the letter of her fidelity. At moment the\nconviction meant no more to him than if he had been assured of the\nhonesty of the first strangers he met in the street. A stranger--that\nwas what she had always been to him. So malleable outwardly, she had\nremained insensible to the touch of the heart.\n\nThese thoughts accompanied him on his way to business the next\nmorning. Then, as the routine took him back, the feeling of strangeness\ndiminished. There he was again at his daily task--nothing tangible was\naltered. He was there for the same purpose as yesterday: to make money\nfor his wife and child. The woman he had turned from on the stairs a few\nhours earlier was still his wife and the mother of Paul Marvell. She was\nan inherent part of his life; the inner disruption had not resulted in\nany outward upheaval. And with the sense of inevitableness there came a\nsudden wave of pity. Poor Undine! She was what the gods had made her--a\ncreature of skin-deep reactions, a mote in the beam of pleasure. He\nhad no desire to \"preach down\" such heart as she had--he felt only a\nstronger wish to reach it, teach it, move it to something of the pity\nthat filled his own. They were fellow-victims in the noyade of marriage,\nbut if they ceased to struggle perhaps the drowning would be easier\nfor both...Meanwhile the first of the month was at hand, with its usual\nbatch of bills; and there was no time to think of any struggle less\npressing than that connected with paying them...\n\nUndine had been surprised, and a little disconcerted, at her husband's\nacceptance of the birthday incident. Since the resetting of her bridal\nornaments the relations between Washington Square and West End Avenue\nhad been more and more strained; and the silent disapproval of the\nMarvell ladies was more irritating to her than open recrimination. She\nknew how keenly Ralph must feel her last slight to his family, and she\nhad been frightened when she guessed that he had seen her returning with\nVan Degen. He must have been watching from the window, since, credulous\nas he always was, he evidently had a reason for not believing her when\nshe told him she had come from the studio. There was therefore something\nboth puzzling and disturbing in his silence; and she made up her mind\nthat it must be either explained or cajoled away.\n\nThese thoughts were with her as she dressed; but at the Ellings' they\nfled like ghosts before light and laughter. She had never been more open\nto the suggestions of immediate enjoyment. At last she had reached the\nenvied situation of the pretty woman with whom society must reckon, and\nif she had only had the means to live up to her opportunities she would\nhave been perfectly content with life, with herself and her husband. She\nstill thought Ralph \"sweet\" when she was not bored by his good advice or\nexasperated by his inability to pay her bills. The question of money\nwas what chiefly stood between them; and now that this was momentarily\ndisposed of by Van Degen's offer she looked at Ralph more kindly--she\neven felt a return of her first impersonal affection for him. Everybody\ncould see that Clare Van Degen was \"gone\" on him, and Undine always\nliked to know that what belonged to her was coveted by others. Her\nreassurance had been fortified by the news she had heard at the Elling\ndinner--the published fact of Harmon B. Driscoll's unexpected victory.\nThe Ararat investigation had been mysteriously stopped--quashed, in the\nlanguage of the law--and Elmer Moffatt \"turned down,\" as Van Degen (who\nsat next to her) expressed it.\n\n\"I don't believe we'll ever hear of that gentleman again,\" he said\ncontemptuously; and their eyes crossed gaily as she exclaimed: \"Then\nthey'll give the fancy ball after all?\"\n\n\"I should have given you one anyhow--shouldn't you have liked that as\nwell?\" \"Oh, you can give me one too!\" she returned; and he bent closer\nto say: \"By Jove, I will--and anything else you want.\"\n\nBut on the way home her fears revived. Ralph's indifference struck\nher as unnatural. He had not returned to the subject of Paul's\ndisappointment, had not even asked her to write a word of excuse to his\nmother. Van Degen's way of looking at her at dinner--he was incapable\nof graduating his glances--had made it plain that the favour she had\naccepted would necessitate her being more conspicuously in his company\n(though she was still resolved that it should be on just such terms as\nshe chose); and it would be extremely troublesome if, at this juncture,\nRalph should suddenly turn suspicious and secretive.\n\nUndine, hitherto, had found more benefits than drawbacks in her\nmarriage; but now the tie began to gall. It was hard to be criticized\nfor every grasp at opportunity by a man so avowedly unable to do the\nreaching for her! Ralph had gone into business to make more money for\nher; but it was plain that the \"more\" would never be much, and that he\nwould not achieve the quick rise to affluence which was man's natural\ntribute to woman's merits. Undine felt herself trapped, deceived; and it\nwas intolerable that the agent of her disillusionment should presume to\nbe the critic of her conduct. Her annoyance, however, died out with\nher fears. Ralph, the morning after the Elling dinner, went his way as\nusual, and after nerving herself for the explosion which did not come\nshe set down his indifference to the dulling effect of \"business.\" No\nwonder poor women whose husbands were always \"down-town\" had to look\nelsewhere for sympathy! Van Degen's cheque helped to calm her, and the\nweeks whirled on toward the Driscoll ball.\n\nThe ball was as brilliant as she had hoped, and her own part in it as\nthrilling as a page from one of the \"society novels\" with which she\nhad cheated the monotony of Apex days. She had no time for reading now:\nevery hour was packed with what she would have called life, and the\nintensity of her sensations culminated on that triumphant evening. What\ncould be more delightful than to feel that, while all the women envied\nher dress, the men did not so much as look at it? Their admiration was\nall for herself, and her beauty deepened under it as flowers take a\nwarmer colour in the rays of sunset. Only Van Degen's glance weighed\non her a little too heavily. Was it possible that he might become a\n\"bother\" less negligible than those he had relieved her of? Undine\nwas not greatly alarmed--she still had full faith in her powers of\nself-defense; but she disliked to feel the least crease in the smooth\nsurface of existence. She had always been what her parents called\n\"sensitive.\"\n\nAs the winter passed, material cares once more assailed her. In\nthe thrill of liberation produced by Van Degen's gift she had been\nimprudent--had launched into fresh expenses. Not that she accused\nherself of extravagance: she had done nothing not really necessary. The\ndrawing-room, for instance, cried out to be \"done over,\" and Popple, who\nwas an authority on decoration, had shown her, with a few strokes of his\npencil how easily it might be transformed into a French \"period\" room,\nall curves and cupids: just the setting for a pretty woman and his\nportrait of her. But Undine, still hopeful of leaving West End Avenue,\nhad heroically resisted the suggestion, and contented herself with the\nrenewal of the curtains and carpet, and the purchase of some fragile\ngilt chairs which, as she told Ralph, would be \"so much to the good\"\nwhen they moved--the explanation, as she made it, seemed an additional\nevidence of her thrift.\n\nPartly as a result of these exertions she had a \"nervous breakdown\"\ntoward the middle of the winter, and her physician having ordered\nmassage and a daily drive it became necessary to secure Mrs. Heeny's\nattendance and to engage a motor by the month. Other unforeseen\nexpenses--the bills, that, at such times, seem to run up without visible\nimpulsion--were added to by a severe illness of little Paul's: a long\ncostly illness, with three nurses and frequent consultations. During\nthese days Ralph's anxiety drove him to what seemed to Undine foolish\nexcesses of expenditure and when the boy began to get better the doctors\nadvised country air. Ralph at once hired a small house at Tuxedo and\nUndine of course accompanied her son to the country; but she spent only\nthe Sundays with him, running up to town during the week to be with\nher husband, as she explained. This necessitated the keeping up of two\nhouseholds, and even for so short a time the strain on Ralph's purse\nwas severe. So it came about that the bill for the fancy-dress was still\nunpaid, and Undine left to wonder distractedly what had become of\nVan Degen's money. That Van Degen seemed also to wonder was becoming\nunpleasantly apparent: his cheque had evidently not brought in the\nreturn he expected, and he put his grievance to her frankly one day when\nhe motored down to lunch at Tuxedo.\n\nThey were sitting, after luncheon, in the low-ceilinged drawing-room to\nwhich Undine had adapted her usual background of cushions, bric-a-brac\nand flowers--since one must make one's setting \"home-like,\" however\nlittle one's habits happened to correspond with that particular effect.\nUndine, conscious of the intimate charm of her mise-en-scene, and of\nthe recovered freshness and bloom which put her in harmony with it,\nhad never been more sure of her power to keep her friend in the desired\nstate of adoring submission. But Peter, as he grew more adoring, became\nless submissive; and there came a moment when she needed all her wits to\nsave the situation. It was easy enough to rebuff him, the easier as his\nphysical proximity always roused in her a vague instinct of resistance;\nbut it was hard so to temper the rebuff with promise that the game of\nsuspense should still delude him. He put it to her at last, standing\nsquarely before her, his batrachian sallowness unpleasantly flushed,\nand primitive man looking out of the eyes from which a frock-coated\ngentleman usually pined at her.\n\n\"Look here--the installment plan's all right; but ain't you a bit behind\neven on that?\" (She had brusquely eluded a nearer approach.) \"Anyhow,\nI think I'd rather let the interest accumulate for a while. This is\ngood-bye till I get back from Europe.\"\n\nThe announcement took her by surprise. \"Europe? Why, when are you\nsailing?\"\n\n\"On the first of April: good day for a fool to acknowledge his folly.\nI'm beaten, and I'm running away.\"\n\nShe sat looking down, her hand absently occupied with the twist of\npearls he had given her. In a flash she saw the peril of this departure.\nOnce off on the Sorceress, he was lost to her--the power of old\nassociations would prevail. Yet if she were as \"nice\" to him as he\nasked--\"nice\" enough to keep him--the end might not be much more to her\nadvantage. Hitherto she had let herself drift on the current of their\nadventure, but she now saw what port she had half-unconsciously been\ntrying for. If she had striven so hard to hold him, had \"played\" him\nwith such patience and such skill, it was for something more than her\npassing amusement and convenience: for a purpose the more tenaciously\ncherished that she had not dared name it to herself. In the light of\nthis discovery she saw the need of feigning complete indifference.\n\n\"Ah, you happy man! It's good-bye indeed, then,\" she threw back at him,\nlifting a plaintive smile to his frown.\n\n\"Oh, you'll turn up in Paris later, I suppose--to get your things for\nNewport.\"\n\n\"Paris? Newport? They're not on my map! When Ralph can get away we shall\ngo to the Adirondacks for the boy. I hope I shan't need Paris clothes\nthere! It doesn't matter, at any rate,\" she ended, laughing, \"because\nnobody I care about will see me.\"\n\nVan Degen echoed her laugh. \"Oh, come--that's rough on Ralph!\"\n\nShe looked down with a slight increase of colour. \"I oughtn't to have\nsaid it, ought I? But the fact is I'm unhappy--and a little hurt--\"\n\n\"Unhappy? Hurt?\" He was at her side again. \"Why, what's wrong?\"\n\nShe lifted her eyes with a grave look. \"I thought you'd be sorrier to\nleave me.\"\n\n\"Oh, it won't be for long--it needn't be, you know.\" He was perceptibly\nsoftening. \"It's damnable, the way you're tied down. Fancy rotting all\nsummer in the Adirondacks! Why do you stand it? You oughtn't to be bound\nfor life by a girl's mistake.\"\n\nThe lashes trembled slightly on her cheek. \"Aren't we all bound by our\nmistakes--we women? Don't let us talk of such things! Ralph would never\nlet me go abroad without him.\" She paused, and then, with a quick upward\nsweep of the lids: \"After all, it's better it should be good-bye--since\nI'm paying for another mistake in being so unhappy at your going.\"\n\n\"Another mistake? Why do you call it that?\"\n\n\"Because I've misunderstood you--or you me.\" She continued to smile at\nhim wistfully. \"And some things are best mended by a break.\"\n\nHe met her smile with a loud sigh--she could feel him in the meshes\nagain. \"IS it to be a break between us?\"\n\n\"Haven't you just said so? Anyhow, it might as well be, since we shan't\nbe in the same place again for months.\"\n\nThe frock-coated gentleman once more languished from his eyes: she\nthought she trembled on the edge of victory. \"Hang it,\" he broke out,\n\"you ought to have a change--you're looking awfully pulled down. Why\ncan't you coax your mother to run over to Paris with you? Ralph couldn't\nobject to that.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I don't believe she could afford it, even if I\ncould persuade her to leave father. You know father hasn't done very\nwell lately: I shouldn't like to ask him for the money.\"\n\n\"You're so confoundedly proud!\" He was edging nearer. \"It would all be\nso easy if you'd only be a little fond of me...\"\n\nShe froze to her sofa-end. \"We women can't repair our mistakes. Don't\nmake me more miserable by reminding me of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense! There's nothing cash won't do. Why won't you let me\nstraighten things out for you?\"\n\nHer colour rose again, and she looked him quickly and consciously in\nthe eye. It was time to play her last card. \"You seem to forget that I\nam--married,\" she said.\n\nVan Degen was silent--for a moment she thought he was swaying to her\nin the flush of surrender. But he remained doggedly seated, meeting her\nlook with an odd clearing of his heated gaze, as if a shrewd businessman\nhad suddenly replaced the pining gentleman at the window.\n\n\"Hang it--so am I!\" he rejoined; and Undine saw that in the last issue\nhe was still the stronger of the two.\n\n\n\nXVII\n\nNothing was bitterer to her than to confess to herself the failure of\nher power; but her last talk with Van Degen had taught her a lesson\nalmost worth the abasement. She saw the mistake she had made in taking\nmoney from him, and understood that if she drifted into repeating that\nmistake her future would be irretrievably compromised. What she wanted\nwas not a hand-to-mouth existence of precarious intrigue: to one with\nher gifts the privileges of life should come openly. Already in her\nshort experience she had seen enough of the women who sacrifice future\nsecurity for immediate success, and she meant to lay solid foundations\nbefore she began to build up the light super-structure of enjoyment.\n\nNevertheless it was galling to see Van Degen leave, and to know that for\nthe time he had broken away from her. Over a nature so insensible to the\nspells of memory, the visible and tangible would always prevail. If she\ncould have been with him again in Paris, where, in the shining spring\ndays, every sight and sound ministered to such influences, she was\nsure she could have regained her hold. And the sense of frustration was\nintensified by the fact that every one she knew was to be there: her\npotential rivals were crowding the east-bound steamers. New York was a\ndesert, and Ralph's seeming unconsciousness of the fact increased her\nresentment. She had had but one chance at Europe since her marriage, and\nthat had been wasted through her husband's unaccountable perversity. She\nknew now with what packed hours of Paris and London they had paid for\ntheir empty weeks in Italy.\n\nMeanwhile the long months of the New York spring stretched out before\nher in all their social vacancy to the measureless blank of a summer in\nthe Adirondacks. In her girlhood she had plumbed the dim depths of such\nsummers; but then she had been sustained by the hope of bringing some\ncapture to the surface. Now she knew better: there were no \"finds\" for\nher in that direction. The people she wanted would be at Newport or\nin Europe, and she was too resolutely bent on a definite object, too\nsternly animated by her father's business instinct, to turn aside in\nquest of casual distractions.\n\nThe chief difficulty in the way of her attaining any distant end had\nalways been her reluctance to plod through the intervening stretches\nof dulness and privation. She had begun to see this, but she could not\nalways master the weakness: never had she stood in greater need of\nMrs. Heeny's \"Go slow. Undine!\" Her imagination was incapable of long\nflights. She could not cheat her impatience with the mirage of far-off\nsatisfactions, and for the moment present and future seemed equally\nvoid. But her desire to go to Europe and to rejoin the little New York\nworld that was reforming itself in London and Paris was fortified by\nreasons which seemed urgent enough to justify an appeal to her father.\n\nShe went down to his office to plead her case, fearing Mrs. Spragg's\nintervention. For some time past Mr. Spragg had been rather continuously\noverworked, and the strain was beginning to tell on him. He had never\nquite regained, in New York, the financial security of his Apex days.\nSince he had changed his base of operations his affairs had followed\nan uncertain course, and Undine suspected that his breach with his old\npolitical ally, the Representative Rolliver who had seen him through the\nmuddiest reaches of the Pure Water Move, was not unconnected with his\nfailure to get a footing in Wall Street. But all this was vague and\nshadowy to her Even had \"business\" been less of a mystery, she was too\nmuch absorbed in her own affairs to project herself into her father's\ncase; and she thought she was sacrificing enough to delicacy of feeling\nin sparing him the \"bother\" of Mrs. Spragg's opposition. When she came\nto him with a grievance he always heard her out with the same mild\npatience; but the long habit of \"managing\" him had made her, in his own\nlanguage, \"discount\" this tolerance, and when she ceased to speak her\nheart throbbed with suspense as he leaned back, twirling an invisible\ntoothpick under his sallow moustache. Presently he raised a hand to\nstroke the limp beard in which the moustache was merged; then he groped\nfor the Masonic emblem that had lost itself in one of the folds of his\ndepleted waistcoat.\n\nHe seemed to fish his answer from the same rusty depths, for as his\nfingers closed about the trinket he said: \"Yes, the heated term IS\ntrying in New York. That's why the Fresh Air Fund pulled my last dollar\nout of me last week.\"\n\nUndine frowned: there was nothing more irritating, in these encounters\nwith her father, than his habit of opening the discussion with a joke.\n\n\"I wish you'd understand that I'm serious, father. I've never been\nstrong since the baby was born, and I need a change. But it's not only\nthat: there are other reasons for my wanting to go.\"\n\nMr. Spragg still held to his mild tone of banter. \"I never knew you\nshort on reasons, Undie. Trouble is you don't always know other people's\nwhen you see 'em.\"\n\nHis daughter's lips tightened. \"I know your reasons when I see them,\nfather: I've heard them often enough. But you can't know mine because I\nhaven't told you--not the real ones.\"\n\n\"Jehoshaphat! I thought they were all real as long as you had a use for\nthem.\"\n\nExperience had taught her that such protracted trifling usually\nconcealed an exceptional vigour of resistance, and the suspense\nstrengthened her determination.\n\n\"My reasons are all real enough,\" she answered; \"but there's one more\nserious than the others.\"\n\nMr. Spragg's brows began to jut. \"More bills?\"\n\n\"No.\" She stretched out her hand and began to finger the dusty objects\non his desk. \"I'm unhappy at home.\"\n\n\"Unhappy--!\" His start overturned the gorged waste-paper basket and shot\na shower of paper across the rug. He stooped to put the basket back;\nthen he turned his slow fagged eyes on his daughter. \"Why, he worships\nthe ground you walk on, Undie.\"\n\n\"That's not always a reason, for a woman--\" It was the answer she would\nhave given to Popple or Van Degen, but she saw in an instant the\nmistake of thinking it would impress her father. In the atmosphere\nof sentimental casuistry to which she had become accustomed, she had\nforgotten that Mr. Spragg's private rule of conduct was as simple as his\nbusiness morality was complicated.\n\nHe glowered at her under thrust-out brows. \"It isn't a reason, isn't it?\nI can seem to remember the time when you used to think it was equal to a\nwhole carload of whitewash.\"\n\nShe blushed a bright red, and her own brows were levelled at his above\nher stormy steel-grey eyes. The sense of her blunder made her angrier\nwith him, and more ruthless.\n\n\"I can't expect you to understand--you never HAVE, you or mother, when\nit came to my feelings. I suppose some people are born sensitive--I\ncan't imagine anybody'd CHOOSE to be so. Because I've been too proud to\ncomplain you've taken it for granted that I was perfectly happy. But my\nmarriage was a mistake from the beginning; and Ralph feels just as I do\nabout it. His people hate me, they've always hated me; and he looks at\neverything as they do. They've never forgiven me for his having had to\ngo into business--with their aristocratic ideas they look down on a man\nwho works for his living. Of course it's all right for YOU to do it,\nbecause you're not a Marvell or a Dagonet; but they think Ralph ought to\njust lie back and let you support the baby and me.\"\n\nThis time she had found the right note: she knew it by the tightening of\nher father's slack muscles and the sudden straightening of his back.\n\n\"By George, he pretty near does!\" he exclaimed bringing down his fist\non the desk. \"They haven't been taking it out of you about that, have\nthey?\" \"They don't fight fair enough to say so. They just egg him on\nto turn against me. They only consented to his marrying me because they\nthought you were so crazy about the match you'd give us everything, and\nhe'd have nothing to do but sit at home and write books.\"\n\nMr. Spragg emitted a derisive groan. \"From what I hear of the amount of\nbusiness he's doing I guess he could keep the Poet's Corner going right\nalong. I suppose the old man was right--he hasn't got it in him to make\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Of course not; he wasn't brought up to it, and in his heart of hearts\nhe's ashamed of having to do it. He told me it was killing a little more\nof him every day.\"\n\n\"Do they back him up in that kind of talk?\"\n\n\"They back him up in everything. Their ideas are all different from\nours. They look down on us--can't you see that? Can't you guess how they\ntreat me from the way they've acted to you and mother?\"\n\nHe met this with a puzzled stare. \"The way they've acted to me and\nmother? Why, we never so much as set eyes on them.\"\n\n\"That's just what I mean! I don't believe they've even called on mother\nthis year, have they? Last year they just left their cards without\nasking. And why do you suppose they never invite you to dine? In their\nset lots of people older than you and mother dine every night of the\nwinter--society's full of them. The Marvells are ashamed to have you\nmeet their friends: that's the reason. They're ashamed to have it known\nthat Ralph married an Apex girl, and that you and mother haven't always\nhad your own servants and carriages; and Ralph's ashamed of it too, now\nhe's got over being crazy about me. If he was free I believe he'd turn\nround to-morrow and marry that Ray girl his mother's saving up for him.\"\n\nMr. Spragg listened with a heavy brow and pushed-out lip. His daughter's\noutburst seemed at last to have roused him to a faint resentment. After\nshe had ceased to speak he remained silent, twisting an inky penhandle\nbetween his fingers; then he said: \"I guess mother and I can worry along\nwithout having Ralph's relatives drop in; but I'd like to make it clear\nto them that if you came from Apex your income came from there too. I\npresume they'd be sorry if Ralph was left to support you on HIS.\"\n\nShe saw that she had scored in the first part of the argument, but every\nwatchful nerve reminded her that the hardest stage was still ahead.\n\n\"Oh, they're willing enough he should take your money--that's only\nnatural, they think.\"\n\nA chuckle sounded deep down under Mr. Spragg's loose collar. \"There\nseems to be practical unanimity on that point,\" he observed. \"But I\ndon't see,\" he continued, jerking round his bushy brows on her, \"how\ngoing to Europe is going to help you out.\"\n\nUndine leaned close enough for her lowered voice to reach him. \"Can't\nyou understand that, knowing how they all feel about me--and how Ralph\nfeels--I'd give almost anything to get away?\"\n\nHer father looked at her compassionately. \"I guess most of us feel that\nonce in a way when we're youngy, Undine. Later on you'll see going away\nain't much use when you've got to turn round and come back.\"\n\nShe nodded at him with close-pressed lips, like a child in possession of\nsome solemn secret.\n\n\"That's just it--that's the reason I'm so wild to go; because it MIGHT\nmean I wouldn't ever have to come back.\"\n\n\"Not come back? What on earth are you talking about?\"\n\n\"It might mean that I could get free--begin over again...\"\n\nHe had pushed his seat back with a sudden jerk and cut her short by\nstriking his palm on the arm of the chair.\n\n\"For the Lord's sake. Undine--do you know what you're saying?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, I know.\" She gave him back a confident smile. \"If I can get\naway soon--go straight over to Paris...there's some one there who'd do\nanything... who COULD do anything...if I was free...\"\n\nMr. Spragg's hands continued to grasp his chair-arms. \"Good God, Undine\nMarvell--are you sitting there in your sane senses and talking to me of\nwhat you could do if you were FREE?\"\n\nTheir glances met in an interval of speechless communion; but Undine did\nnot shrink from her father's eyes and when she lowered her own it seemed\nto be only because there was nothing left for them to say.\n\n\"I know just what I could do if I were free. I could marry the right\nman,\" she answered boldly.\n\nHe met her with a murmur of helpless irony. \"The right man? The right\nman? Haven't you had enough of trying for him yet?\"\n\nAs he spoke the door behind them opened, and Mr. Spragg looked up\nabruptly.\n\nThe stenographer stood on the threshold, and above her shoulder Undine\nperceived the ingratiating grin of Elmer Moffatt.\n\n\"'A little farther lend thy guiding hand'--but I guess I can go the rest\nof the way alone,\" he said, insinuating himself through the doorway with\nan airy gesture of dismissal; then he turned to Mr. Spragg and Undine.\n\n\"I agree entirely with Mrs. Marvell--and I'm happy to have the\nopportunity of telling her so,\" he proclaimed, holding his hand out\ngallantly.\n\nUndine stood up with a laugh. \"It sounded like old times, I suppose--you\nthought father and I were quarrelling? But we never quarrel any more: he\nalways agrees with me.\" She smiled at Mr. Spragg and turned her shining\neyes on Moffatt. \"I wish that treaty had been signed a few years\nsooner!\" the latter rejoined in his usual tone of humorous familiarity.\n\nUndine had not met him since her marriage, and of late the adverse\nturn of his fortunes had carried him quite beyond her thoughts. But\nhis actual presence was always stimulating, and even through her\nself-absorption she was struck by his air of almost defiant prosperity.\nHe did not look like a man who has been beaten; or rather he looked like\na man who does not know when he is beaten; and his eye had the gleam\nof mocking confidence that had carried him unabashed through his lowest\nhours at Apex.\n\n\"I presume you're here to see me on business?\" Mr. Spragg enquired,\nrising from his chair with a glance that seemed to ask his daughter's\nsilence.\n\n\"Why, yes. Senator,\" rejoined Moffatt, who was given, in playful\nmoments, to the bestowal of titles high-sounding. \"At least I'm here to\nask you a little question that may lead to business.\"\n\nMr. Spragg crossed the office and held open the door. \"Step this way,\nplease,\" he said, guiding Moffatt out before him, though the latter hung\nback to exclaim: \"No family secrets, Mrs. Marvell--anybody can turn the\nfierce white light on ME!\"\n\nWith the closing of the door Undine's thoughts turned back to her own\npreoccupations. It had not struck her as incongruous that Moffatt should\nhave business dealings with her father: she was even a little surprised\nthat Mr. Spragg should still treat him so coldly. But she had no time to\ngive to such considerations. Her own difficulties were too importunately\npresent to her. She moved restlessly about the office, listening to\nthe rise and fall of the two voices on the other side of the partition\nwithout once wondering what they were discussing.\n\nWhat should she say to her father when he came back--what argument was\nmost likely to prevail with him? If he really had no money to give her\nshe was imprisoned fast--Van Degen was lost to her, and the old life\nmust go on interminably...In her nervous pacings she paused before the\nblotched looking-glass that hung in a corner of the office under a\nsteel engraving of Daniel Webster. Even that defective surface could not\ndisfigure her, and she drew fresh hope from the sight of her beauty.\nHer few weeks of ill-health had given her cheeks a subtler curve and\ndeepened the shadows beneath her eyes, and she was handsomer than before\nher marriage. No, Van Degen was not lost to her even! From narrowed lids\nto parted lips her face was swept by a smile like retracted sunlight.\nHe was not lost to her while she could smile like that! Besides, even if\nher father had no money, there were always mysterious ways of \"raising\"\nit--in the old Apex days he had often boasted of such feats. As the hope\nrose her eyes widened trustfully, and this time the smile that flowed\nup to them was as limpid as a child's. That was the was her father liked\nher to look at him...\n\nThe door opened, and she heard Mr. Spragg say behind her: \"No, sir, I\nwon't--that's final.\"\n\nHe came in alone, with a brooding face, and lowered himself heavily into\nhis chair. It was plain that the talk between the two men had had an\nabrupt ending. Undine looked at her father with a passing flicker of\ncuriosity. Certainly it was an odd coincidence that Moffatt should have\ncalled while she was there...\n\n\"What did he want?\" she asked, glancing back toward the door.\n\nMr. Spragg mumbled his invisible toothpick. \"Oh, just another of his\nwild-cat schemes--some real-estate deal he's in.\"\n\n\"Why did he come to YOU about it?\"\n\nHe looked away from her, fumbling among the letters on the desk. \"Guess\nhe'd tried everybody else first. He'd go and ring the devil's front-door\nbell if he thought he could get anything out of him.\"\n\n\"I suppose he did himself a lot of harm by testifying in the Ararat\ninvestigation?\"\n\n\"Yes, SIR--he's down and out this time.\"\n\nHe uttered the words with a certain satisfaction. His daughter did not\nanswer, and they sat silent, facing each other across the littered desk.\nUnder their brief about Elmer Moffatt currents of rapid intelligence\nseemed to be flowing between them. Suddenly Undine leaned over the desk,\nher eyes widening trustfully, and the limpid smile flowing up to them.\n\n\"Father, I did what you wanted that one time, anyhow--won't you listen\nto me and help me out now?\"\n\n\n\nXVIII\n\nUndine stood alone on the landing outside her father's office.\n\nOnly once before had she failed to gain her end with him--and there\nwas a peculiar irony in the fact that Moffatt's intrusion should have\nbrought before her the providential result of her previous failure. Not\nthat she confessed to any real resemblance between the two situations.\nIn the present case she knew well enough what she wanted, and how to\nget it. But the analogy had served her father's purpose, and Moffatt's\nunlucky entrance had visibly strengthened his resistance.\n\nThe worst of it was that the obstacles in the way were real enough. Mr.\nSpragg had not put her off with vague asseverations--somewhat against\nher will he had forced his proofs on her, showing her how much above\nhis promised allowance he had contributed in the last three years to\nthe support of her household. Since she could not accuse herself of\nextravagance--having still full faith in her gift of \"managing\"--she\ncould only conclude that it was impossible to live on what her father\nand Ralph could provide; and this seemed a practical reason for desiring\nher freedom. If she and Ralph parted he would of course return to his\nfamily, and Mr. Spragg would no longer be burdened with a helpless\nson-in-law. But even this argument did not move him. Undine, as soon as\nshe had risked Van Degen's name, found herself face to face with a code\nof domestic conduct as rigid as its exponent's business principles were\nelastic. Mr. Spragg did not regard divorce as intrinsically wrong or\neven inexpedient; and of its social disadvantages he had never even\nheard. Lots of women did it, as Undine said, and if their reasons were\nadequate they were justified. If Ralph Marvell had been a drunkard or\n\"unfaithful\" Mr. Spragg would have approved Undine's desire to divorce\nhim; but that it should be prompted by her inclination for another\nman--and a man with a wife of his own--was as shocking to him as it\nwould have been to the most uncompromising of the Dagonets and Marvells.\nSuch things happened, as Mr. Spragg knew, but they should not happen to\nany woman of his name while he had the power to prevent it; and Undine\nrecognized that for the moment he had that power.\n\nAs she emerged from the elevator she was surprised to see Moffatt in the\nvestibule. His presence was an irritating reminder of her failure, and\nshe walked past him with a rapid bow; but he overtook her.\n\n\"Mrs. Marvell--I've been waiting to say a word to you.\"\n\nIf it had been any one else she would have passed on; but Moffatt's\nvoice had always a detaining power. Even now that she knew him to be\ndefeated and negligible, the power asserted itself, and she paused to\nsay: \"I'm afraid I can't stop--I'm late for an engagement.\"\n\n\"I shan't make you much later; but if you'd rather have me call round at\nyour house--\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm so seldom in.\" She turned a wondering look on him. \"What is it\nyou wanted to say?\"\n\n\"Just two words. I've got an office in this building and the shortest\nway would be to come up there for a minute.\" As her look grew distant he\nadded: \"I think what I've got to say is worth the trip.\"\n\nHis face was serious, without underlying irony: the face he wore when he\nwanted to be trusted.\n\n\"Very well,\" she said, turning back.\n\nUndine, glancing at her watch as she came out of Moffatt's office, saw\nthat he had been true to his promise of not keeping her more than ten\nminutes. The fact was characteristic. Under all his incalculableness\nthere had always been a hard foundation of reliability: it seemed to be\na matter of choice with him whether he let one feel that solid bottom\nor not. And in specific matters the same quality showed itself in an\naccuracy of statement, a precision of conduct, that contrasted curiously\nwith his usual hyperbolic banter and his loose lounging manner. No one\ncould be more elusive yet no one could be firmer to the touch. Her\nface had cleared and she moved more lightly as she left the building.\nMoffatt's communication had not been completely clear to her, but she\nunderstood the outline of the plan he had laid before her, and was\nsatisfied with the bargain they had struck. He had begun by reminding\nher of her promise to introduce him to any friend of hers who might be\nuseful in the way of business. Over three years had passed since they\nhad made the pact, and Moffatt had kept loyally to his side of it. With\nthe lapse of time the whole matter had become less important to her,\nbut she wanted to prove her good faith, and when he reminded her of her\npromise she at once admitted it.\n\n\"Well, then--I want you to introduce me to your husband.\"\n\nUndine was surprised; but beneath her surprise she felt a quick sense of\nrelief. Ralph was easier to manage than so many of her friends--and\nit was a mark of his present indifference to acquiesce in anything she\nsuggested.\n\n\"My husband? Why, what can he do for you?\"\n\nMoffatt explained at once, in the fewest words, as his way was when it\ncame to business. He was interested in a big \"deal\" which involved the\npurchase of a piece of real estate held by a number of wrangling\nheirs. The real-estate broker with whom Ralph Marvell was associated\nrepresented these heirs, but Moffatt had his reasons for not approaching\nhim directly. And he didn't want to go to Marvell with a \"business\nproposition\"--it would be better to be thrown with him socially as if by\naccident. It was with that object that Moffatt had just appealed to Mr.\nSpragg, but Mr. Spragg, as usual, had \"turned him down,\" without even\nconsenting to look into the case.\n\n\"He'd rather have you miss a good thing than have it come to you through\nme. I don't know what on earth he thinks it's in my power to do to\nyou--or ever was, for that matter,\" he added. \"Anyhow,\" he went on to\nexplain, \"the power's all on your side now; and I'll show you how little\nthe doing will hurt you as soon as I can have a quiet chat with\nyour husband.\" He branched off again into technicalities, nebulous\nprojections of capital and interest, taxes and rents, from which she\nfinally extracted, and clung to, the central fact that if the \"deal\nwent through\" it would mean a commission of forty thousand dollars to\nMarvell's firm, of which something over a fourth would come to Ralph.\n\n\"By Jove, that's an amazing fellow!\" Ralph Marvell exclaimed, turning\nback into the drawing-room, a few evenings later, at the conclusion of\none of their little dinners. Undine looked up from her seat by the fire.\nShe had had the inspired thought of inviting Moffatt to meet Clare Van\nDegen, Mrs. Fairford and Charles Bowen. It had occurred to her that\nthe simplest way of explaining Moffatt was to tell Ralph that she had\nunexpectedly discovered an old Apex acquaintance in the protagonist of\nthe great Ararat Trust fight. Moffatt's defeat had not wholly\ndivested him of interest. As a factor in affairs he no longer inspired\napprehension, but as the man who had dared to defy Harmon B. Driscoll he\nwas a conspicuous and, to some minds, almost an heroic figure.\n\nUndine remembered that Clare and Mrs. Fairford had once expressed a wish\nto see this braver of the Olympians, and her suggestion that he should\nbe asked meet them gave Ralph evident pleasure. It was long since she\nhad made any conciliatory sign to his family.\n\nMoffatt's social gifts were hardly of a kind to please the two ladies:\nhe would have shone more brightly in Peter Van Degen's set than in\nhis wife's. But neither Clare nor Mrs. Fairford had expected a man\nof conventional cut, and Moffatt's loud easiness was obviously\nless disturbing to them than to their hostess. Undine felt only his\ncrudeness, and the tacit criticism passed on it by the mere presence of\nsuch men as her husband and Bowen; but Mrs. Fairford' seemed to enjoy\nprovoking him to fresh excesses of slang and hyperbole. Gradually she\ndrew him into talking of the Driscoll campaign, and he became recklessly\nexplicit. He seemed to have nothing to hold back: all the details of the\nprodigious exploit poured from him with Homeric volume. Then he broke\noff abruptly, thrusting his hands into his trouser-pockets and shaping\nhis red lips to a whistle which he checked as his glance met Undine's.\nTo conceal his embarrassment he leaned back in his chair, looked about\nthe table with complacency, and said \"I don't mind if I do\" to the\nservant who approached to re-fill his champagne glass.\n\nThe men sat long over their cigars; but after an interval Undine called\nCharles Bowen into the drawing-room to settle some question in dispute\nbetween Clare and Mrs. Fairford, and thus gave Moffatt a chance to be\nalone with her husband. Now that their guests had gone she was throbbing\nwith anxiety to know what had passed between the two; but when Ralph\nrejoined her in the drawing-room she continued to keep her eyes on the\nfire and twirl her fan listlessly.\n\n\"That's an amazing chap,\" Ralph repeated, looking down at her. \"Where\nwas it you ran across him--out at Apex?\"\n\nAs he leaned against the chimney-piece, lighting his cigarette, it\nstruck Undine that he looked less fagged and lifeless than usual, and\nshe felt more and more sure that something important had happened during\nthe moment of isolation she had contrived.\n\nShe opened and shut her fan reflectively. \"Yes--years ago; father had\nsome business with him and brought him home to dinner one day.\"\n\n\"And you've never seen him since?\"\n\nShe waited, as if trying to piece her recollections together. \"I suppose\nI must have; but all that seems so long ago,\" she said sighing. She had\nbeen given, of late, to such plaintive glances toward her happy girlhood\nbut Ralph seemed not to notice the allusion.\n\n\"Do you know,\" he exclaimed after a moment, \"I don't believe the\nfellow's beaten yet.\"\n\nShe looked up quickly. \"Don't you?\"\n\n\"No; and I could see that Bowen didn't either. He strikes me as the kind\nof man who develops slowly, needs a big field, and perhaps makes some\nbig mistakes, but gets where he wants to in the end. Jove, I wish I\ncould put him in a book! There's something epic about him--a kind of\nepic effrontery.\"\n\nUndine's pulses beat faster as she listened. Was it not what Moffatt had\nalways said of himself--that all he needed was time and elbow-room? How\nodd that Ralph, who seemed so dreamy and unobservant, should instantly\nhave reached the same conclusion! But what she wanted to know was the\npractical result of their meeting.\n\n\"What did you and he talk about when you were smoking?\"\n\n\"Oh, he got on the Driscoll fight again--gave us some extraordinary\ndetails. The man's a thundering brute, but he's full of observation and\nhumour. Then, after Bowen joined you, he told me about a new deal he's\ngone into--rather a promising scheme, but on the same Titanic scale.\nIt's just possible, by the way, that we may be able to do something for\nhim: part of the property he's after is held in our office.\" He paused,\nknowing Undine's indifference to business matters; but the face she\nturned to him was alive with interest.\n\n\"You mean you might sell the property to him?\"\n\n\"Well, if the thing comes off. There would be a big commission if we\ndid.\" He glanced down on her half ironically. \"You'd like that, wouldn't\nyou?\"\n\nShe answered with a shade of reproach: \"Why do you say that? I haven't\ncomplained.\"\n\n\"Oh, no; but I know I've been a disappointment as a money-maker.\"\n\nShe leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes as if in utter weariness\nand indifference, and in a moment she felt him bending over her. \"What's\nthe matter? Don't you feel well?\"\n\n\"I'm a little tired. It's nothing.\" She pulled her hand away and burst\ninto tears.\n\nRalph knelt down by her chair and put his arm about her. It was the\nfirst time he had touched her since the night of the boy's birthday, and\nthe sense of her softness woke a momentary warmth in his veins.\n\n\"What is it, dear? What is it?\"\n\nWithout turning her head she sobbed out: \"You seem to think I'm too\nselfish and odious--that I'm just pretending to be ill.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" he assured her, smoothing back her hair. But she continued\nto sob on in a gradual crescendo of despair, till the vehemence of her\nweeping began to frighten him, and he drew her to her feet and tried\nto persuade her to let herself be led upstairs. She yielded to his arm,\nsobbing in short exhausted gasps, and leaning her whole weight on him as\nhe guided her along the passage to her bedroom. On the lounge to which\nhe lowered her she lay white and still, tears trickling through her\nlashes and her handkerchief pressed against her lips. He recognized the\nsymptoms with a sinking heart: she was on the verge of a nervous attack\nsuch as she had had in the winter, and he foresaw with dismay the\ndisastrous train of consequences, the doctors' and nurses' bills, and\nall the attendant confusion and expense. If only Moffatt's project might\nbe realized--if for once he could feel a round sum in his pocket, and be\nfreed from the perpetual daily strain!\n\nThe next morning Undine, though calmer, was too weak to leave her bed,\nand her doctor prescribed rest and absence of worry--later, perhaps, a\nchange of scene. He explained to Ralph that nothing was so wearing to\na high-strung nature as monotony, and that if Mrs. Marvell were\ncontemplating a Newport season it was necessary that she should be\nfortified to meet it. In such cases he often recommended a dash to Paris\nor London, just to tone up the nervous system.\n\nUndine regained her strength slowly, and as the days dragged on the\nsuggestion of the European trip recurred with increasing frequency. But\nit came always from her medical adviser: she herself had grown strangely\npassive and indifferent. She continued to remain upstairs on her lounge,\nseeing no one but Mrs. Heeny, whose daily ministrations had once more\nbeen prescribed, and asking only that the noise of Paul's play should be\nkept from her. His scamperings overhead disturbed her sleep, and his\nbed was moved into the day nursery, above his father's room. The child's\nearly romping did not trouble Ralph, since he himself was always awake\nbefore daylight. The days were not long enough to hold his cares, and\nthey came and stood by him through the silent hours, when there was no\nother sound to drown their voices.\n\nRalph had not made a success of his business. The real-estate brokers\nwho had taken him into partnership had done so only with the hope of\nprofiting by his social connections; and in this respect the alliance\nhad been a failure. It was in such directions that he most lacked\nfacility, and so far he had been of use to his partners only as an\noffice-drudge. He was resigned to the continuance of such drudgery,\nthough all his powers cried out against it; but even for the routine of\nbusiness his aptitude was small, and he began to feel that he was not\nconsidered an addition to the firm. The difficulty of finding another\nopening made him fear a break; and his thoughts turned hopefully to\nElmer Moffatt's hint of a \"deal.\" The success of the negotiation might\nbring advantages beyond the immediate pecuniary profit; and that, at the\npresent juncture, was important enough in itself.\n\nMoffatt reappeared two days after the dinner, presenting himself in West\nEnd Avenue in the late afternoon with the explanation that the business\nin hand necessitated discretion, and that he preferred not to be seen in\nRalph's office. It was a question of negotiating with the utmost privacy\nfor the purchase of a small strip of land between two large plots\nalready acquired by purchasers cautiously designated by Moffatt as his\n\"parties.\" How far he \"stood in\" with the parties he left it to Ralph\nto conjecture; but it was plain that he had a large stake in the\ntransaction, and that it offered him his first chance of recovering\nhimself since Driscoll had \"thrown\" him. The owners of the coveted\nplot did not seem anxious to sell, and there were personal reasons for\nMoffatt's not approaching them through Ralph's partners, who were the\nregular agents of the estate: so that Ralph's acquaintance with the\nconditions, combined with his detachments from the case, marked him out\nas a useful intermediary.\n\nTheir first talk left Ralph with a dazzled sense of Moffatt's strength\nand keenness, but with a vague doubt as to the \"straightness\" of the\nproposed transaction. Ralph had never seen his way clearly in that dim\nunderworld of affairs where men of the Moffatt and Driscoll type moved\nlike shadowy destructive monsters beneath the darting small fry of the\nsurface. He knew that \"business\" has created its own special morality;\nand his musings on man's relation to his self imposed laws had shown him\nhow little human conduct is generally troubled about its own sanctions.\nHe had a vivid sense of the things a man of his kind didn't do; but his\ninability to get a mental grasp on large financial problems made it hard\nto apply to them so simple a measure as this inherited standard. He only\nknew, as Moffatt's plan developed, that it seemed all right while he\ntalked of it with its originator, but vaguely wrong when he thought it\nover afterward. It occurred to him to consult his grandfather; and if he\nrenounced the idea for the obvious reason that Mr. Dagonet's ignorance\nof business was as fathomless as his own, this was not his sole motive.\nFinally it occurred to him to put the case hypothetically to Mr.\nSpragg. As far as Ralph knew, his father-in-law's business record was\nunblemished; yet one felt in him an elasticity of adjustment not allowed\nfor in the Dagonet code.\n\nMr. Spragg listened thoughtfully to Ralph's statement of the case,\ngrowling out here and there a tentative correction, and turning his\ncigar between his lips as he seemed to turn the problem over in the\nloose grasp of his mind.\n\n\"Well, what's the trouble with it?\" he asked at length, stretching his\nbig square-toed shoes against the grate of his son-in-law's dining-room,\nwhere, in the after-dinner privacy of a family evening, Ralph had seized\nthe occasion to consult him.\n\n\"The trouble?\" Ralph considered. \"Why, that's just what I should like\nyou to explain to me.\"\n\nMr. Spragg threw back his head and stared at the garlanded French clock\non the chimney-piece. Mrs. Spragg was sitting upstairs in her daughter's\nbedroom, and the silence of the house seemed to hang about the two men\nlike a listening presence.\n\n\"Well, I dunno but what I agree with the doctor who said there warn't\nany diseases, but only sick people. Every case is different, I guess.\"\nMr. Spragg, munching his cigar, turned a ruminating glance on Ralph.\n\"Seems to me it all boils down to one thing. Was this fellow we're\nsupposing about under any obligation to the other party--the one he was\ntrying to buy the property from?\"\n\nRalph hesitated. \"Only the obligation recognized between decent men to\ndeal with each other decently.\" Mr. Spragg listened to this with the\nsuffering air of a teacher compelled to simplify upon his simplest\nquestions.\n\n\"Any personal obligation, I meant. Had the other fellow done him a good\nturn any time?\"\n\n\"No--I don't imagine them to have had any previous relations at all.\"\n\nHis father-in-law stared. \"Where's your trouble, then?\" He sat for a\nmoment frowning at the embers. \"Even when it's the other way round it\nain't always so easy to decide how far that kind of thing's binding...\nand they say shipwrecked fellows'll make a meal of friend as quick as\nthey would of a total stranger.\" He drew himself together with a shake\nof his shoulders and pulled back his feet from the grate. \"But I don't\nsee the conundrum in your case, I guess it's up to both parties to take\ncare of their own skins.\"\n\nHe rose from his chair and wandered upstairs to Undine.\n\nThat was the Wall Street code: it all \"boiled down\" to the personal\nobligation, to the salt eaten in the enemy's tent. Ralph's fancy\nwandered off on a long trail of speculation from which he was pulled\nback with a jerk by the need of immediate action. Moffatt's \"deal\"\ncould not wait: quick decisions were essential to effective action, and\nbrooding over ethical shades of difference might work more ill than\ngood in a world committed to swift adjustments. The arrival of several\nunforeseen bills confirmed this view, and once Ralph had adopted it he\nbegan to take a detached interest in the affair.\n\nIn Paris, in his younger days, he had once attended a lesson in acting\ngiven at the Conservatoire by one of the great lights of the theatre,\nand had seen an apparently uncomplicated role of the classic repertory,\nfamiliar to him through repeated performances, taken to pieces before\nhis eyes, dissolved into its component elements, and built up again with\na minuteness of elucidation and a range of reference that made him\nfeel as though he had been let into the secret of some age-long natural\nprocess. As he listened to Moffatt the remembrance of that lesson came\nback to him. At the outset the \"deal,\" and his own share in it, had\nseemed simple enough: he would have put on his hat and gone out on the\nspot in the full assurance of being able to transact the affair. But as\nMoffatt talked he began to feel as blank and blundering as the class of\ndramatic students before whom the great actor had analyzed his part. The\naffair was in fact difficult and complex, and Moffatt saw at once just\nwhere the difficulties lay and how the personal idiosyncrasies of \"the\nparties\" affected them. Such insight fascinated Ralph, and he strayed\noff into wondering why it did not qualify every financier to be a\nnovelist, and what intrinsic barrier divided the two arts.\n\nBoth men had strong incentives for hastening the affair; and within a\nfortnight after Moffatt's first advance Ralph was able to tell him that\nhis offer was accepted. Over and above his personal satisfaction he felt\nthe thrill of the agent whom some powerful negotiator has charged with\na delicate mission: he might have been an eager young Jesuit carrying\ncompromising papers to his superior. It had been stimulating to work\nwith Moffatt, and to study at close range the large powerful instrument\nof his intelligence.\n\nAs he came out of Moffatt's office at the conclusion of this visit\nRalph met Mr. Spragg descending from his eyrie. He stopped short with a\nbackward glance at Moffatt's door.\n\n\"Hallo--what were you doing in there with those cut-throats?\"\n\nRalph judged discretion to be essential. \"Oh, just a little business for\nthe firm.\"\n\nMr. Spragg said no more, but resorted to the soothing labial motion of\nrevolving his phantom toothpick.\n\n\"How's Undie getting along?\" he merely asked, as he and his son-in-law\ndescended together in the elevator.\n\n\"She doesn't seem to feel much stronger. The doctor wants her to run\nover to Europe for a few weeks. She thinks of joining her friends the\nShallums in Paris.\"\n\nMr. Spragg was again silent, but he left the building at Ralph's side,\nand the two walked along together toward Wall Street.\n\nPresently the older man asked: \"How did you get acquainted with\nMoffatt?\"\n\n\"Why, by chance--Undine ran across him somewhere and asked him to dine\nthe other night.\"\n\n\"Undine asked him to dine?\"\n\n\"Yes: she told me you used to know him out at Apex.\"\n\nMr. Spragg appeared to search his memory for confirmation of the fact.\n\"I believe he used to be round there at one time. I've never heard any\ngood of him yet.\" He paused at a crossing and looked probingly at his\nson-in-law. \"Is she terribly set on this trip to Europe?\"\n\nRalph smiled. \"You know how it is when she takes a fancy to do\nanything--\"\n\nMr. Spragg, by a slight lift of his brooding brows, seemed to convey a\ndeep if unspoken response.\n\n\"Well, I'd let her do it this time--I'd let her do it,\" he said as he\nturned down the steps of the Subway.\n\nRalph was surprised, for he had gathered from some frightened references\nof Mrs. Spragg's that Undine's parents had wind of her European plan and\nwere strongly opposed to it. He concluded that Mr. Spragg had long since\nmeasured the extent of profitable resistance, and knew just when it\nbecame vain to hold out against his daughter or advise others to do so.\n\nRalph, for his own part, had no inclination to resist. As he left\nMoffatt's office his inmost feeling was one of relief. He had reached\nthe point of recognizing that it was best for both that his wife should\ngo. When she returned perhaps their lives would readjust themselves--but\nfor the moment he longed for some kind of benumbing influence, something\nthat should give relief to the dull daily ache of feeling her so near\nand yet so inaccessible. Certainly there were more urgent uses for their\nbrilliant wind-fall: heavy arrears of household debts had to be met,\nand the summer would bring its own burden. But perhaps another stroke of\nluck might befall him: he was getting to have the drifting dependence\non \"luck\" of the man conscious of his inability to direct his life. And\nmeanwhile it seemed easier to let Undine have what she wanted.\n\nUndine, on the whole, behaved with discretion. She received the good\nnews languidly and showed no unseemly haste to profit by it. But it was\nas hard to hide the light in her eyes as to dissemble the fact that she\nhad not only thought out every detail of the trip in advance, but had\ndecided exactly how her husband and son were to be disposed of in her\nabsence. Her suggestion that Ralph should take Paul to his grandparents,\nand that the West End Avenue house should be let for the summer, was too\npractical not to be acted on; and Ralph found she had already put her\nhand on the Harry Lipscombs, who, after three years of neglect, were to\nbe dragged back to favour and made to feel, as the first step in their\nreinstatement, the necessity of hiring for the summer months a cool airy\nhouse on the West Side. On her return from Europe, Undine explained, she\nwould of course go straight to Ralph and the boy in the Adirondacks; and\nit seemed a foolish extravagance to let the house stand empty when the\nLipscombs were so eager to take it.\n\nAs the day of departure approached it became harder for her to temper\nher beams; but her pleasure showed itself so amiably that Ralph began\nto think she might, after all, miss the boy and himself more than she\nimagined. She was tenderly preoccupied with Paul's welfare, and, to\nprepare for his translation to his grandparents' she gave the household\nin Washington Square more of her time than she had accorded it since\nher marriage. She explained that she wanted Paul to grow used to his\nnew surroundings; and with that object she took him frequently to his\ngrandmother's, and won her way into old Mr. Dagonet's sympathies by her\ndevotion to the child and her pretty way of joining in his games.\n\nUndine was not consciously acting a part: this new phase was as natural\nto her as the other. In the joy of her gratified desires she wanted to\nmake everybody about her happy. If only everyone would do as she wished\nshe would never be unreasonable. She much preferred to see smiling faces\nabout her, and her dread of the reproachful and dissatisfied countenance\ngave the measure of what she would do to avoid it.\n\nThese thoughts were in her mind when, a day or two before sailing, she\ncame out of the Washington Square house with her boy. It was a late\nspring afternoon, and she and Paul had lingered on till long past the\nhour sacred to his grandfather's nap. Now, as she came out into the\nsquare she saw that, however well Mr. Dagonet had borne their protracted\nromp, it had left his playmate flushed and sleepy; and she lifted Paul\nin her arms to carry him to the nearest cab-stand.\n\nAs she raised herself she saw a thick-set figure approaching her across\nthe square; and a moment later she was shaking hands with Elmer Moffatt.\nIn the bright spring air he looked seasonably glossy and prosperous; and\nshe noticed that he wore a bunch of violets in his buttonhole. His small\nblack eyes twinkled with approval as they rested on her, and Undine\nreflected that, with Paul's arms about her neck, and his little flushed\nface against her own, she must present a not unpleasing image of young\nmotherhood.\n\n\"That the heir apparent?\" Moffatt asked; adding \"Happy to make your\nacquaintance, sir,\" as the boy, at Undine's bidding, held out a fist\nsticky with sugarplums.\n\n\"He's been spending the afternoon with his grandfather, and they played\nso hard that he's sleepy,\" she explained. Little Paul, at that stage\nin his career, had a peculiar grace of wide-gazing deep-lashed eyes and\narched cherubic lips, and Undine saw that Moffatt was not insensible\nto the picture she and her son composed. She did not dislike his\nadmiration, for she no longer felt any shrinking from him--she would\neven have been glad to thank him for the service he had done her husband\nif she had known how to allude to it without awkwardness. Moffatt seemed\nequally pleased at the meeting, and they looked at each other almost\nintimately over Paul's tumbled curls.\n\n\"He's a mighty fine fellow and no mistake--but isn't he rather an armful\nfor you?\" Moffatt asked, his eyes lingering with real kindliness on the\nchild's face.\n\n\"Oh, we haven't far to go. I'll pick up a cab at the corner.\"\n\n\"Well, let me carry him that far anyhow,\" said Moffatt.\n\nUndine was glad to be relieved of her burden, for she was unused to the\nchild's weight, and disliked to feel that her skirt was dragging on\nthe pavement. \"Go to the gentleman, Pauly--he'll carry you better than\nmother,\" she said.\n\nThe little boy's first movement was one of recoil from the ruddy\nsharp-eyed countenance that was so unlike his father's delicate face;\nbut he was an obedient child, and after a moment's hesitation he wound\nhis arms trustfully about the red gentleman's neck.\n\n\"That's a good fellow--sit tight and I'll give you a ride,\" Moffatt\ncried, hoisting the boy to his shoulder.\n\nPaul was not used to being perched at such a height, and his nature was\nhospitable to new impressions. \"Oh, I like it up here--you're higher\nthan father!\" he exclaimed; and Moffatt hugged him with a laugh.\n\n\"It must feel mighty good to come uptown to a fellow like you in the\nevenings,\" he said, addressing the child but looking at Undine, who also\nlaughed a little.\n\n\"Oh, they're a dreadful nuisance, you know; but Paul's a very good boy.\"\n\n\"I wonder if he knows what a friend I've been to him lately,\" Moffatt\nwent on, as they turned into Fifth Avenue.\n\nUndine smiled: she was glad he should have given her an opening. \"He\nshall be told as soon as he's old enough to thank you. I'm so glad you\ncame to Ralph about that business.\"\n\n\"Oh I gave him a leg up, and I guess he's given me one too. Queer the\nway things come round--he's fairly put me in the way of a fresh start.\"\n\nTheir eyes met in a silence which Undine was the first to break. \"It's\nbeen awfully nice of you to do what you've done--right along. And this\nlast thing has made a lot of difference to us.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm glad you feel that way. I never wanted to be anything but\n'nice,' as you call it.\" Moffatt paused a moment and then added: \"If\nyou're less scared of me than your father is I'd be glad to call round\nand see you once in a while.\"\n\nThe quick blood rushed to her cheeks. There was nothing challenging,\ndemanding in his tone--she guessed at once that if he made the request\nit was simply for the pleasure of being with her, and she liked the\nmagnanimity implied. Nevertheless she was not sorry to have to answer:\n\"Of course I'll always be glad to see you--only, as it happens, I'm just\nsailing for Europe.\"\n\n\"For Europe?\" The word brought Moffatt to a stand so abruptly that\nlittle Paul lurched on his shoulder.\n\n\"For Europe?\" he repeated. \"Why, I thought you said the other evening\nyou expected to stay on in town till July. Didn't you think of going to\nthe Adirondacks?\"\n\nFlattered by his evident disappointment, she became high and careless\nin her triumph. \"Oh, yes,--but that's all changed. Ralph and the boy are\ngoing, but I sail on Saturday to join some friends in Paris--and later I\nmay do some motoring in Switzerland an Italy.\"\n\nShe laughed a little in the mere enjoyment of putting her plans into\nwords and Moffatt laughed too, but with an edge of sarcasm.\n\n\"I see--I see: everything's changed, as you say, and your husband can\nblow you off to the trip. Well, I hope you'll have a first-class time.\"\n\nTheir glances crossed again, and something in his cool scrutiny impelled\nUndine to say, with a burst of candour: \"If I do, you know, I shall owe\nit all to you!\"\n\n\"Well, I always told you I meant to act white by you,\" he answered.\n\nThey walked on in silence, and presently he began again in his usual\njoking strain: \"See what one of the Apex girls has been up to?\"\n\nApex was too remote for her to understand the reference, and he went on:\n\"Why, Millard Binch's wife--Indiana Frusk that was. Didn't you see in\nthe papers that Indiana'd fixed it up with James J. Rolliver to marry\nher? They say it was easy enough squaring Millard Binch--you'd know it\nWOULD be--but it cost Roliver near a million to mislay Mrs. R. and the\nchildren. Well, Indiana's pulled it off, anyhow; she always WAS a bright\ngirl. But she never came up to you.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" she stammered with a laugh, astonished and agitated by his news.\nIndiana Frusk and Rolliver! It showed how easily the thing could be\ndone. If only her father had listened to her! If a girl like Indiana\nFrusk could gain her end so easily, what might not Undine have\naccomplished? She knew Moffatt was right in saying that Indiana had\nnever come up to her...She wondered how the marriage would strike Van\nDegen...\n\nShe signalled to a cab and they walked toward it without speaking.\nUndine was recalling with intensity that one of Indiana's shoulders was\nhigher than the other, and that people in Apex had thought her lucky to\ncatch Millard Binch, the druggist's clerk, when Undine herself had cast\nhim off after a lingering engagement. And now Indiana Frusk was to be\nMrs. James J. Rolliver!\n\nUndine got into the cab and bent forward to take little Paul.\n\nMoffatt lowered his charge with exaggerated care, and a \"Steady there,\nsteady,\" that made the child laugh; then, stooping over, he put a kiss\non Paul's lips before handing him over to his mother.\n\n\n\nXIX\n\n\"The Parisian Diamond Company--Anglo-American branch.\"\n\nCharles Bowen, seated, one rainy evening of the Paris season, in a\ncorner of the great Nouveau Luxe restaurant, was lazily trying to\nresolve his impressions of the scene into the phrases of a letter to his\nold friend Mrs. Henley Fairford.\n\nThe long habit of unwritten communion with this lady--in no way\nconditioned by the short rare letters they actually exchanged--usually\ncaused his notations, in absence, to fall into such terms when the\nsubject was of a kind to strike an answering flash from her. And who\nbut Mrs. Fairford would see, from his own precise angle, the fantastic\nimprobability, the layers on layers of unsubstantialness, on which the\nseemingly solid scene before him rested?\n\nThe dining-room of the Nouveau Luxe was at its fullest, and, having\ncontracted on the garden side through stress of weather, had even\noverflowed to the farther end of the long hall beyond; so that Bowen,\nfrom his corner, surveyed a seemingly endless perspective of plumed\nand jewelled heads, of shoulders bare or black-coated, encircling the\nclose-packed tables. He had come half an hour before the time he had\nnamed to his expected guest, so that he might have the undisturbed\namusement of watching the picture compose itself again before his eyes.\nDuring some forty years' perpetual exercise of his perceptions he\nhad never come across anything that gave them the special titillation\nproduced by the sight of the dinner-hour at the Nouveau Luxe: the same\nsense of putting his hand on human nature's passion for the factitious,\nits incorrigible habit of imitating the imitation.\n\nAs he sat watching the familiar faces swept toward him on the rising\ntide of arrival--for it was one of the joys of the scene that the type\nwas always the same even when the individual was not--he hailed with\nrenewed appreciation this costly expression of a social ideal. The\ndining-room at the Nouveau Luxe represented, on such a spring evening,\nwhat unbounded material power had devised for the delusion of its\nleisure: a phantom \"society,\" with all the rules, smirks, gestures of\nits model, but evoked out of promiscuity and incoherence while the other\nhad been the product of continuity and choice. And the instinct which\nhad driven a new class of world-compellers to bind themselves to slavish\nimitation of the superseded, and their prompt and reverent faith in\nthe reality of the sham they had created, seemed to Bowen the most\nsatisfying proof of human permanence.\n\nWith this thought in his mind he looked up to greet his guest. The Comte\nRaymond de Chelles, straight, slim and gravely smiling, came toward him\nwith frequent pauses of salutation at the crowded tables; saying, as he\nseated himself and turned his pleasant eyes on the scene: \"Il n'y a pas\n\u00c3\u00a0 dire, my dear Bowen, it's charming and sympathetic and original--we\nowe America a debt of gratitude for inventing it!\"\n\nBowen felt a last touch of satisfaction: they were the very words to\ncomplete his thought.\n\n\"My dear fellow, it's really you and your kind who are responsible. It's\nthe direct creation of feudalism, like all the great social upheavals!\"\n\nRaymond de Chelles stroked his handsome brown moustache. \"I should have\nsaid, on the contrary, that one enjoyed it for the contrast. It's such\na refreshing change from our institutions--which are, nevertheless, the\nnecessary foundations of society. But just as one may have an infinite\nadmiration for one's wife, and yet occasionally--\" he waved a light hand\ntoward the spectacle. \"This, in the social order, is the diversion,\nthe permitted diversion, that your original race has devised: a kind of\nsuperior Bohemia, where one may be respectable without being bored.\"\n\nBowen laughed. \"You've put it in a nutshell: the ideal of the American\nwoman is to be respectable without being bored; and from that point of\nview this world they've invented has more originality than I gave it\ncredit for.\"\n\nChelles thoughtfully unfolded his napkin. \"My impression's a superficial\none, of course--for as to what goes on underneath--!\" He looked across\nthe room. \"If I married I shouldn't care to have my wife come here too\noften.\"\n\nBowen laughed again. \"She'd be as safe as in a bank! Nothing ever goes\non! Nothing that ever happens here is real.\"\n\n\"Ah, quant \u00c3\u00a0 cela--\" the Frenchman murmured, inserting a fork into\nhis melon. Bowen looked at him with enjoyment--he was such a precious\nfoot-note to the page! The two men, accidentally thrown together some\nyears previously during a trip up the Nile, always met again with\npleasure when Bowen returned to France. Raymond de Chelles, who came of\na family of moderate fortune, lived for the greater part of the year\non his father's estates in Burgundy; but he came up every spring to the\nentresol of the old Marquis's hotel for a two months' study of human\nnature, applying to the pursuit the discriminating taste and transient\nardour that give the finest bloom to pleasure. Bowen liked him as a\ncompanion and admired him as a charming specimen of the Frenchman of his\nclass, embodying in his lean, fatigued and finished person that happy\nmean of simplicity and intelligence of which no other race has found the\nsecret. If Raymond de Chelles had been English he would have been a\nmere fox-hunting animal, with appetites but without tastes; but in his\nlighter Gallic clay the wholesome territorial savour, the inherited\npassion for sport and agriculture, were blent with an openness to finer\nsensations, a sense of the come-and-go of ideas, under which one felt\nthe tight hold of two or three inherited notions, religious, political,\nand domestic, in total contradiction to his surface attitude. That the\ninherited notions would in the end prevail, everything in his appearance\ndeclared from the distinguished slant of his nose to the narrow forehead\nunder his thinning hair; he was the kind of man who would inevitably\n\"revert\" when he married. But meanwhile the surface he presented to the\nplay of life was broad enough to take in the fantastic spectacle of the\nNouveau Luxe; and to see its gestures reflected in a Latin consciousness\nwas an endless entertainment to Bowen.\n\nThe tone of his guest's last words made him take them up. \"But is the\nlady you allude to more than a hypothesis? Surely you're not thinking of\ngetting married?\"\n\nChelles raised his eye-brows ironically. \"When hasn't one to think of\nit, in my situation? One hears of nothing else at home--one knows that,\nlike death, it has to come.\" His glance, which was still mustering the\nroom, came to a sudden pause and kindled.\n\n\"Who's the lady over there--fair-haired, in white--the one who's just\ncome in with the red-faced man? They seem to be with a party of your\ncompatriots.\"\n\nBowen followed his glance to a neighbouring table, where, at the moment,\nUndine Marvell was seating herself at Peter Van Degen's side, in the\ncompany of the Harvey Shallums, the beautiful Mrs. Beringer and a dozen\nother New York figures.\n\nShe was so placed that as she took her seat she recognized Bowen and\nsent him a smile across the tables. She was more simply dressed than\nusual, and the pink lights, warming her cheeks and striking gleams from\nher hair, gave her face a dewy freshness that was new to Bowen. He\nhad always thought her beauty too obvious, too bathed in the bright\npublicity of the American air; but to-night she seemed to have been\nbrushed by the wing of poetry, and its shadow lingered in her eyes.\n\nChelles' gaze made it evident that he had received the same impression.\n\n\"One is sometimes inclined to deny your compatriots actual beauty--to\ncharge them with producing the effect without having the features; but\nin this case--you say you know the lady?\"\n\n\"Yes: she's the wife of an old friend.\"\n\n\"The wife? She's married? There, again, it's so puzzling! Your\nyoung girls look so experienced, and your married women sometimes\nso--unmarried.\"\n\n\"Well, they often are--in these days of divorce!\"\n\nThe other's interest quickened. \"Your friend's divorced?\"\n\n\"Oh, no; heaven forbid! Mrs. Marvell hasn't been long married; and it\nwas a love-match of the good old kind.\"\n\n\"Ah--and the husband? Which is he?\"\n\n\"He's not here--he's in New York.\"\n\n\"Feverishly adding to a fortune already monstrous?\"\n\n\"No; not precisely monstrous. The Marvells are not well off,\" said\nBowen, amused by his friend's interrogations.\n\n\"And he allows an exquisite being like that to come to Paris without\nhim--and in company with the red-faced gentleman who seems so alive to\nhis advantages?\"\n\n\"We don't 'allow' our women this or that; I don't think we set much\nstore by the compulsory virtues.\"\n\nHis companion received this with amusement. \"If: you're as detached as\nthat, why does the obsolete institution of marriage survive with you?\"\n\n\"Oh, it still has its uses. One couldn't be divorced without it.\"\n\nChelles laughed again; but his straying eye still followed the same\ndirection, and Bowen noticed that the fact was not unremarked by the\nobject of his contemplation. Undine's party was one of the liveliest in\nthe room: the American laugh rose above the din of the orchestra as the\nAmerican toilets dominated the less daring effects at the other\ntables. Undine, on entering, had seemed to be in the same mood as her\ncompanions; but Bowen saw that, as she became conscious of his friend's\nobservation, she isolated herself in a kind of soft abstraction; and\nhe admired the adaptability which enabled her to draw from such\nsurroundings the contrasting graces of reserve.\n\nThey had greeted each other with all the outer signs of cordiality,\nbut Bowen fancied she would not care to have him speak to her. She was\nevidently dining with Van Degen, and Van Degen's proximity was the last\nfact she would wish to have transmitted to the critics in Washington\nSquare. Bowen was therefore surprised when, as he rose to leave the\nrestaurant, he heard himself hailed by Peter.\n\n\"Hallo--hold on! When did you come over? Mrs. Marvell's dying for the\nlast news about the old homestead.\"\n\nUndine's smile confirmed the appeal. She wanted to know how lately Bowen\nhad left New York, and pressed him to tell her when he had last seen her\nboy, how he was looking, and whether Ralph had been persuaded to go down\nto Clare's on Saturdays and get a little riding and tennis? And dear\nLaura--was she well too, and was Paul with her, or still with his\ngrandmother? They were all dreadfully bad correspondents, and so was\nshe. Undine laughingly admitted; and when Ralph had last written her\nthese questions had still been undecided.\n\nAs she smiled up at Bowen he saw her glance stray to the spot where his\ncompanion hovered; and when the diners rose to move toward the garden\nfor coffee she said, with a sweet note and a detaining smile: \"Do come\nwith us--I haven't half finished.\"\n\nVan Degen echoed the request, and Bowen, amused by Undine's arts, was\npresently introducing Chelles, and joining with him in the party's\ntransit to the terrace. The rain had ceased, and under the clear evening\nsky the restaurant garden opened green depths that skilfully hid its\nnarrow boundaries. Van Degen's company was large enough to surround\ntwo of the tables on the terrace, and Bowen noted the skill with which\nUndine, leaving him to Mrs. Shallum's care, contrived to draw Raymond de\nChelles to the other table. Still more noticeable was the effect of\nthis stratagem on Van Degen, who also found himself relegated to Mrs.\nShallum's group. Poor Peter's state was betrayed by the irascibility\nwhich wreaked itself on a jostling waiter, and found cause for loud\nremonstrance in the coldness of the coffee and the badness of the\ncigars; and Bowen, with something more than the curiosity of the\nlooker-on, wondered whether this were the real clue to Undine's conduct.\nHe had always smiled at Mrs. Fairford's fears for Ralph's domestic\npeace. He thought Undine too clear-headed to forfeit the advantages of\nher marriage; but it now struck him that she might have had a glimpse\nof larger opportunities. Bowen, at the thought, felt the pang of\nthe sociologist over the individual havoc wrought by every social\nreadjustment: it had so long been clear to him that poor Ralph was a\nsurvival, and destined, as such, to go down in any conflict with the\nrising forces.\n\n\n\nXX\n\nSome six weeks later. Undine Marvell stood at the window smiling down on\nher recovered Paris.\n\nHer hotel sitting-room had, as usual, been flowered, cushioned and\nlamp-shaded into a delusive semblance of stability; and she had really\nfelt, for the last few weeks, that the life she was leading there must\nbe going to last--it seemed so perfect an answer to all her wants!\n\nAs she looked out at the thronged street, on which the summer light lay\nlike a blush of pleasure, she felt herself naturally akin to all the\nbright and careless freedom of the scene. She had been away from\nParis for two days, and the spectacle before her seemed more rich and\nsuggestive after her brief absence from it. Her senses luxuriated in\nall its material details: the thronging motors, the brilliant shops, the\nnovelty and daring of the women's dresses, the piled-up colours of\nthe ambulant flower-carts, the appetizing expanse of the fruiterers'\nwindows, even the chromatic effects of the petits fours behind the\nplate-glass of the pastry-cooks: all the surface-sparkle and variety of\nthe inexhaustible streets of Paris.\n\nThe scene before her typified to Undine her first real taste of life.\nHow meagre and starved the past appeared in comparison with this\nabundant present! The noise, the crowd, the promiscuity beneath her eyes\nsymbolized the glare and movement of her life. Every moment of her days\nwas packed with excitement and exhilaration. Everything amused her: the\nlong hours of bargaining and debate with dress-makers and jewellers, the\ncrowded lunches at fashionable restaurants, the perfunctory dash through\na picture-show or the lingering visit to the last new milliner; the\nafternoon motor-rush to some leafy suburb, where tea and musics and\nsunset were hastily absorbed on a crowded terrace above the Seine; the\nwhirl home through the Bois to dress for dinner and start again on the\nround of evening diversions; the dinner at the Nouveau Luxe or the\nCaf\u00c3\u00a9 de Paris, and the little play at the Capucines or the Vari\u00c3\u00a9t\u00c3\u00a9s,\nfollowed, because the night was \"too lovely,\" and it was a shame to\nwaste it, by a breathless flight back to the Bois, with supper in one\nof its lamp-hung restaurants, or, if the weather forbade, a tumultuous\nprogress through the midnight haunts where \"ladies\" were not supposed\nto show themselves, and might consequently taste the thrill of being\noccasionally taken for their opposites.\n\nAs the varied vision unrolled itself, Undine contrasted it with the\npale monotony of her previous summers. The one she most resented was the\nfirst after her marriage, the European summer out of whose joys she had\nbeen cheated by her own ignorance and Ralph's perversity. They had been\nfree then, there had been no child to hamper their movements, their\nmoney anxieties had hardly begun, the face of life had been fresh\nand radiant, and she had been doomed to waste such opportunities on a\nsuccession of ill-smelling Italian towns. She still felt it to be her\ndeepest grievance against her husband; and now that, after four years of\npetty household worries, another chance of escape had come, he already\nwanted to drag her back to bondage!\n\nThis fit of retrospection had been provoked by two letters which had\ncome that morning. One was from Ralph, who began by reminding her that\nhe had not heard from her for weeks, and went on to point out, in his\nusual tone of good-humoured remonstrance, that since her departure the\ndrain on her letter of credit had been deep and constant. \"I wanted\nyou,\" he wrote, \"to get all the fun you could out of the money I made\nlast spring; but I didn't think you'd get through it quite so fast. Try\nto come home without leaving too many bills behind you. Your illness and\nPaul's cost more than I expected, and Lipscomb has had a bad knock in\nWall Street, and hasn't yet paid his first quarter...\"\n\nAlways the same monotonous refrain! Was it her fault that she and the\nboy had been ill? Or that Harry Lipscomb had been \"on the wrong side\" of\nWall Street? Ralph seemed to have money on the brain: his business life\nhad certainly deteriorated him. And, since he hadn't made a success of\nit after all, why shouldn't he turn back to literature and try to write\nhis novel? Undine, the previous winter, had been dazzled by the figures\nwhich a well-known magazine editor, whom she had met at dinner had named\nas within reach of the successful novelist. She perceived for the first\ntime that literature was becoming fashionable, and instantly decided\nthat it would be amusing and original if she and Ralph should owe their\nprosperity to his talent. She already saw herself, as the wife of a\ncelebrated author, wearing \"artistic\" dresses and doing the drawing-room\nover with Gothic tapestries and dim lights in altar candle-sticks. But\nwhen she suggested Ralph's taking up his novel he answered with a laugh\nthat his brains were sold to the firm--that when he came back at night\nthe tank was empty...And now he wanted her to sail for home in a week!\n\nThe other letter excited a deeper resentment. It was an appeal from\nLaura Fairford to return and look after Ralph. He was overworked and out\nof spirits, she wrote, and his mother and sister, reluctant as they\nwere to interfere, felt they ought to urge Undine to come back to him.\nDetails followed, unwelcome and officious. What right had Laura Fairford\nto preach to her of wifely obligations? No doubt Charles Bowen had sent\nhome a highly-coloured report--and there was really a certain irony in\nMrs. Fairford's criticizing her sister-in-law's conduct on information\nobtained from such a source! Undine turned from the window and threw\nherself down on her deeply cushioned sofa. She was feeling the pleasant\nfatigue consequent on her trip to the country, whither she and Mrs.\nShallum had gone with Raymond de Chelles to spend a night at the old\nMarquis's chateau. When her travelling companions, an hour earlier, had\nleft her at her door, she had half-promised to rejoin them for a late\ndinner in the Bois; and as she leaned back among the cushions disturbing\nthoughts were banished by the urgent necessity of deciding what dress\nshe should wear.\n\nThese bright weeks of the Parisian spring had given her a first real\nglimpse into the art of living. From the experts who had taught her to\nsubdue the curves of her figure and soften her bright free stare with\ndusky pencillings, to the skilled purveyors of countless forms of\npleasure--the theatres and restaurants, the green and blossoming\nsuburbs, the whole shining shifting spectacle of nights and days--every\nsight and sound and word had combined to charm her perceptions and\nrefine her taste. And her growing friendship with Raymond de Chelles had\nbeen the most potent of these influences.\n\nChelles, at once immensely \"taken,\" had not only shown his eagerness to\nshare in the helter-skelter motions of Undine's party, but had given her\nglimpses of another, still more brilliant existence, that life of the\ninaccessible \"Faubourg\" of which the first tantalizing hints had but\nlately reached her. Hitherto she had assumed that Paris existed for the\nstranger, that its native life was merely an obscure foundation for\nthe dazzling superstructure of hotels and restaurants in which her\ncompatriots disported themselves. But lately she had begun to hear\nabout other American women, the women who had married into the French\naristocracy, and who led, in the high-walled houses beyond the Seine\nwhich she had once thought so dull and dingy, a life that made her own\nseem as undistinguished as the social existence of the Mealey\nHouse. Perhaps what most exasperated her was the discovery, in this\nimpenetrable group, of the Miss Wincher who had poisoned her far-off\nsummer at Potash Springs. To recognize her old enemy in the Marquise de\nTrezac who so frequently figured in the Parisian chronicle was the more\nirritating to Undine because her intervening social experiences had\ncaused her to look back on Nettie Wincher as a frumpy girl who wouldn't\nhave \"had a show\" in New York.\n\nOnce more all the accepted values were reversed, and it turned out that\nMiss Wincher had been in possession of some key to success on which\nUndine had not yet put her hand. To know that others were indifferent to\nwhat she had thought important was to cheapen all present pleasure and\nturn the whole force of her desires in a new direction. What she wanted\nfor the moment was to linger on in Paris, prolonging her flirtation with\nChelles, and profiting by it to detach herself from her compatriots and\nenter doors closed to their approach. And Chelles himself attracted\nher: she thought him as \"sweet\" as she had once thought Ralph, whose\nfastidiousness and refinement were blent in him with a delightful\nforeign vivacity. His chief value, however, lay in his power of exciting\nVan Degen's jealousy. She knew enough of French customs to be aware that\nsuch devotion as Chelles' was not likely to have much practical bearing\non her future; but Peter had an alarming way of lapsing into security,\nand as a spur to his ardour she knew the value of other men's\nattentions.\n\nIt had become Undine's fixed purpose to bring Van Degen to a definite\nexpression of his intentions. The case of Indiana Frusk, whose brilliant\nmarriage the journals of two continents had recently chronicled with\nunprecedented richness of detail, had made less impression on him than\nshe hoped. He treated it as a comic episode without special bearing on\ntheir case, and once, when Undine cited Rolliver's expensive fight for\nfreedom as an instance of the power of love over the most invulnerable\nnatures, had answered carelessly: \"Oh, his first wife was a laundress, I\nbelieve.\"\n\nBut all about them couples were unpairing and pairing again with an ease\nand rapidity that encouraged Undine to bide her time. It was simply a\nquestion of making Van Degen want her enough, and of not being obliged\nto abandon the game before he wanted her as much as she meant he should.\nThis was precisely what would happen if she were compelled to leave\nParis now. Already the event had shown how right she had been to come\nabroad: the attention she attracted in Paris had reawakened Van Degen's\nfancy, and her hold over him was stronger than when they had parted\nin America. But the next step must be taken with coolness and\ncircumspection; and she must not throw away what she had gained by going\naway at a stage when he was surer of her than she of him. She was still\nintensely considering these questions when the door behind her opened\nand he came in.\n\nShe looked up with a frown and he gave a deprecating laugh. \"Didn't I\nknock? Don't look so savage! They told me downstairs you'd got back, and\nI just bolted in without thinking.\"\n\nHe had widened and purpled since their first encounter, five years\nearlier, but his features had not matured. His face was still the\nface of a covetous bullying boy, with a large appetite for primitive\nsatisfactions and a sturdy belief in his intrinsic right to them. It was\nall the more satisfying to Undine's vanity to see his look change at her\ntone from command to conciliation, and from conciliation to the entreaty\nof a capriciously-treated animal.\n\n\"What a ridiculous hour for a visit!\" she exclaimed, ignoring his\nexcuse. \"Well, if you disappear like that, without a word--\"\n\n\"I told my maid to telephone you I was going away.\"\n\n\"You couldn't make time to do it yourself, I suppose?\"\n\n\"We rushed off suddenly; I'd hardly time to get to the station.\"\n\n\"You rushed off where, may I ask?\" Van Degen still lowered down on her.\n\n\"Oh didn't I tell you? I've been down staying at Chelles' chateau in\nBurgundy.\" Her face lit up and she raised herself eagerly on her elbow.\n\n\"It's the most wonderful old house you ever saw: a real castle, with\ntowers, and water all round it, and a funny kind of bridge they pull up.\nChelles said he wanted me to see just how they lived at home, and I did;\nI saw everything: the tapestries that Louis Quinze gave them, and the\nfamily portraits, and the chapel, where their own priest says mass, and\nthey sit by themselves in a balcony with crowns all over it. The priest\nwas a lovely old man--he said he'd give anything to convert me. Do you\nknow, I think there's something very beautiful about the Roman Catholic\nreligion? I've often felt I might have been happier if I'd had some\nreligious influence in my life.\"\n\nShe sighed a little, and turned her head away. She flattered herself\nthat she had learned to strike the right note with Van Degen. At this\ncrucial stage he needed a taste of his own methods, a glimpse of the\nfact that there were women in the world who could get on without him.\n\nHe continued to gaze down at her sulkily. \"Were the old people there?\nYou never told me you knew his mother.\"\n\n\"I don't. They weren't there. But it didn't make a bit of difference,\nbecause Raymond sent down a cook from the Luxe.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lord,\" Van Degen groaned, dropping down on the end of the sofa.\n\"Was the cook got down to chaperon you?\"\n\nUndine laughed. \"You talk like Ralph! I had Bertha with me.\"\n\n\"BERTHA!\" His tone of contempt surprised her. She had supposed that Mrs.\nShallum's presence had made the visit perfectly correct.\n\n\"You went without knowing his parents, and without their inviting you?\nDon't you know what that sort of thing means out here? Chelles did it\nto brag about you at his club. He wants to compromise you--that's his\ngame!\"\n\n\"Do you suppose he does?\" A flicker of a smile crossed her lips. \"I'm\nso unconventional: when I like a man I never stop to think about such\nthings. But I ought to, of course--you're quite right.\" She looked at\nVan Degen thoughtfully. \"At any rate, he's not a married man.\"\n\nVan Degen had got to his feet again and was standing accusingly before\nher; but as she spoke the blood rose to his neck and ears. \"What\ndifference does that make?\"\n\n\"It might make a good deal. I see,\" she added, \"how careful I ought to\nbe about going round with you.\"\n\n\"With ME?\" His face fell at the retort; then he broke into a laugh. He\nadored Undine's \"smartness,\" which was of precisely the same quality\nas his own. \"Oh, that's another thing: you can always trust me to look\nafter you!\"\n\n\"With your reputation? Much obliged!\"\n\nVan Degen smiled. She knew he liked such allusions, and was pleased that\nshe thought him compromising.\n\n\"Oh, I'm as good as gold. You've made a new man of me!\"\n\n\"Have I?\" She considered him in silence for a moment. \"I wonder what\nyou've done to me but make a discontented woman of me--discontented with\neverything I had before I knew you?\"\n\nThe change of tone was thrilling to him. He forgot her mockery, forgot\nhis rival, and sat down at her side, almost in possession of her waist.\n\"Look here,\" he asked, \"where are we going to dine to-night?\"\n\nHis nearness was not agreeable to Undine, but she liked his free way,\nhis contempt for verbal preliminaries. Ralph's reserves and delicacies,\nhis perpetual desire that he and she should be attuned to the same key,\nhad always vaguely bored her; whereas in Van Degen's manner she felt a\nhint of the masterful way that had once subdued her in Elmer Moffatt.\nBut she drew back, releasing herself.\n\n\"To-night? I can't--I'm engaged.\"\n\n\"I know you are: engaged to ME! You promised last Sunday you'd dine with\nme out of town to-night.\"\n\n\"How can I remember what I promised last Sunday? Besides, after what\nyou've said, I see I oughtn't to.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by what I've said?\"\n\n\"Why, that I'm imprudent; that people are talking--\"\n\nHe stood up with an angry laugh. \"I suppose you're dining with Chelles.\nIs that it?\"\n\n\"Is that the way you cross-examine Clare?\"\n\n\"I don't care a hang what Clare does--I never have.\"\n\n\"That must--in some ways--be rather convenient for her!\"\n\n\"Glad you think so. ARE you dining with him?\"\n\nShe slowly turned the wedding-ring upon her finger. \"You know I'm NOT\nmarried to you--yet!\"\n\nHe took a random turn through the room; then he came back and planted\nhimself wrathfully before her. \"Can't you see the man's doing his best\nto make a fool of you?\"\n\nShe kept her amused gaze on him. \"Does it strike you that it's such an\nawfully easy thing to do?\"\n\nThe edges of his ears were purple. \"I sometimes think it's easier for\nthese damned little dancing-masters than for one of us.\"\n\nUndine was still smiling up at him; but suddenly her grew grave. \"What\ndoes it matter what I do or don't do, when Ralph has ordered me home\nnext week?\"\n\n\"Ordered you home?\" His face changed. \"Well, you're not going, are you?\"\n\n\"What's the use of saying such things?\" She gave a disenchanted laugh.\n\"I'm a poor man's wife, and can't do the things my friends do. It's not\nbecause Ralph loves me that he wants me back--it's simply because he\ncan't afford to let me stay!\"\n\nVan Degen's perturbation was increasing. \"But you mustn't go--it's\npreposterous! Why should a woman like you be sacrificed when a lot of\ndreary frumps have everything they want? Besides, you can't chuck me\nlike this! Why, we're all to motor down to Aix next week, and perhaps\ntake a dip into Italy--\"\n\n\"OH, ITALY--\" she murmured on a note of yearning.\n\nHe was closer now, and had her hands. \"You'd love that, wouldn't you?\nAs far as Venice, anyhow; and then in August there's Trouville--you've\nnever tried Trouville? There's an awfully jolly crowd there--and the\nmotoring's ripping in Normandy. If you say so I'll take a villa\nthere instead of going back to Newport. And I'll put the Sorceress in\ncommission, and you can make up parties and run off whenever you like,\nto Scotland or Norway--\" He hung above her. \"Don't dine with Chelles\nto-night! Come with me, and we'll talk things over; and next week we'll\nrun down to Trouville to choose the villa.\"\n\nUndine's heart was beating fast, but she felt within her a strange lucid\nforce of resistance. Because of that sense of security she left her\nhands in Van Degen's. So Mr. Spragg might have felt at the tensest hour\nof the Pure Water move. She leaned forward, holding her suitor off by\nthe pressure of her bent-back palms.\n\n\"Kiss me good-bye, Peter; I sail on Wednesday,\" she said.\n\nIt was the first time she had permitted him a kiss, and as his face\ndarkened down on her she felt a moment's recoil. But her physical\nreactions were never very acute: she always vaguely wondered why\npeople made \"such a fuss,\" were so violently for or against such\ndemonstrations. A cool spirit within her seemed to watch over and\nregulate her sensations, and leave her capable of measuring the\nintensity of those she provoked.\n\nShe turned to look at the clock. \"You must go now--I shall be hours late\nfor dinner.\"\n\n\"Go--after that?\" He held her fast. \"Kiss me again,\" he commanded.\n\nIt was wonderful how cool she felt--how easily she could slip out of his\ngrasp! Any man could be managed like a child if he were really in love\nwith one....\n\n\"Don't be a goose, Peter; do you suppose I'd have kissed you if--\"\n\n\"If what--what--what?\" he mimicked her ecstatically, not listening.\n\nShe saw that if she wished to make him hear her she must put more\ndistance between them, and she rose and moved across the room. From the\nfireplace she turned to add--\"if we hadn't been saying good-bye?\"\n\n\"Good-bye--now? What's the use of talking like that?\" He jumped up and\nfollowed her. \"Look here, Undine--I'll do anything on earth you want;\nonly don't talk of going! If you'll only stay I'll make it all as\nstraight and square as you please. I'll get Bertha Shallum to stop over\nwith you for the summer; I'll take a house at Trouville and make my wife\ncome out there. Hang it, she SHALL, if you say so! Only be a little good\nto me!\"\n\nStill she stood before him without speaking, aware that her implacable\nbrows and narrowed lips would hold him off as long as she chose.\n\n\"What's the matter. Undine? Why don't you answer? You know you can't go\nback to that deadly dry-rot!\"\n\nShe swept about on him with indignant eyes. \"I can't go on with my\npresent life either. It's hateful--as hateful as the other. If I don't\ngo home I've got to decide on something different.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'something different'?\" She was silent, and he\ninsisted: \"Are you really thinking of marrying Chelles?\"\n\nShe started as if he had surprised a secret. \"I'll never forgive you if\nyou speak of it--\"\n\n\"Good Lord! Good Lord!\" he groaned.\n\nShe remained motionless, with lowered lids, and he went up to her and\npulled her about so that she faced him. \"Undine, honour bright--do you\nthink he'll marry you?\"\n\nShe looked at him with a sudden hardness in her eyes. \"I really can't\ndiscuss such things with you.\"\n\n\"Oh, for the Lord's sake don't take that tone! I don't half know what\nI'm saying...but you mustn't throw yourself away a second time. I'll do\nanything you want--I swear I will!\"\n\nA knock on the door sent them apart, and a servant entered with a\ntelegram.\n\nUndine turned away to the window with the narrow blue slip. She was glad\nof the interruption: the sense of what she had at stake made her want to\npause a moment and to draw breath.\n\nThe message was a long cable signed with Laura Fairford's name. It told\nher that Ralph had been taken suddenly ill with pneumonia, that his\ncondition was serious and that the doctors advised his wife's immediate\nreturn.\n\nUndine had to read the words over two or three times to get them into\nher crowded mind; and even after she had done so she needed more time to\nsee their bearing on her own situation. If the message had concerned\nher boy her brain would have acted more quickly. She had never troubled\nherself over the possibility of Paul's falling ill in her absence, but\nshe understood now that if the cable had been about him she would have\nrushed to the earliest steamer. With Ralph it was different. Ralph was\nalways perfectly well--she could not picture him as being suddenly at\ndeath's door and in need of her. Probably his mother and sister had had\na panic: they were always full of sentimental terrors. The next moment\nan angry suspicion flashed across her: what if the cable were a device\nof the Marvell women to bring her back? Perhaps it had been sent\nwith Ralph's connivance! No doubt Bowen had written home about\nher--Washington Square had received some monstrous report of her\ndoings!... Yes, the cable was clearly an echo of Laura's letter--mother\nand daughter had cooked it up to spoil her pleasure. Once the thought\nhad occurred to her it struck root in her mind and began to throw out\ngiant branches. Van Degen followed her to the window, his face still\nflushed and working. \"What's the matter?\" he asked, as she continued to\nstare silently at the telegram.\n\nShe crumpled the strip of paper in her hand. If only she had been alone,\nhad had a chance to think out her answers!\n\n\"What on earth's the matter?\" he repeated.\n\n\"Oh, nothing--nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing? When you're as white as a sheet?\"\n\n\"Am I?\" She gave a slight laugh. \"It's only a cable from home.\"\n\n\"Ralph?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"No. Laura.\"\n\n\"What the devil is SHE cabling you about?\"\n\n\"She says Ralph wants me.\"\n\n\"Now--at once?\"\n\n\"At once.\"\n\nVan Degen laughed impatiently. \"Why don't he tell you so himself? What\nbusiness is it of Laura Fairford's?\"\n\nUndine's gesture implied a \"What indeed?\"\n\n\"Is that all she says?\"\n\nShe hesitated again. \"Yes--that's all.\" As she spoke she tossed the\ntelegram into the basket beneath the writing-table. \"As if I didn't HAVE\nto go anyhow?\" she exclaimed.\n\nWith an aching clearness of vision she saw what lay before her--the\nhurried preparations, the long tedious voyage on a steamer chosen at\nhaphazard, the arrival in the deadly July heat, and the relapse into all\nthe insufferable daily fag of nursery and kitchen--she saw it and her\nimagination recoiled.\n\nVan Degen's eyes still hung on her: she guessed that he was intensely\nengaged in trying to follow what was passing through her mind. Presently\nhe came up to her again, no longer perilous and importunate, but\nawkwardly tender, ridiculously moved by her distress.\n\n\"Undine, listen: won't you let me make it all right for you to stay?\"\n\nHer heart began to beat more quickly, and she let him come close,\nmeeting his eyes coldly but without anger.\n\n\"What do you call 'making it all right'? Paying my bills? Don't you see\nthat's what I hate, and will never let myself be dragged into again?\"\nShe laid her hand on his arm. \"The time has come when I must be\nsensible, Peter; that's why we must say good-bye.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me you're going back to Ralph?\"\n\nShe paused a moment; then she murmured between her lips: \"I shall never\ngo back to him.\"\n\n\"Then you DO mean to marry Chelles?\"\n\n\"I've told you we must say good-bye. I've got to look out for my\nfuture.\"\n\nHe stood before her, irresolute, tormented, his lazy mind and impatient\nsenses labouring with a problem beyond their power. \"Ain't I here to\nlook out for your future?\" he said at last.\n\n\"No one shall look out for it in the way you mean. I'd rather never see\nyou again--\"\n\nHe gave her a baffled stare. \"Oh, damn it--if that's the way you feel!\"\nHe turned and flung away toward the door.\n\nShe stood motionless where he left her, every nerve strung to the\nhighest pitch of watchfulness. As she stood there, the scene about her\nstamped itself on her brain with the sharpest precision. She was aware\nof the fading of the summer light outside, of the movements of her maid,\nwho was laying out her dinner-dress in the room beyond, and of the fact\nthat the tea-roses on her writing-table, shaken by Van Degen's tread,\nwere dropping their petals over Ralph's letter, and down on the\ncrumpled telegram which she could see through the trellised sides of the\nscrap-basket.\n\nIn another moment Van Degen would be gone. Worse yet, while he wavered\nin the doorway the Shallums and Chelles, after vainly awaiting her,\nmight dash back from the Bois and break in on them. These and other\nchances rose before her, urging her to action; but she held fast,\nimmovable, unwavering, a proud yet plaintive image of renunciation.\n\nVan Degen's hand was on the door. He half-opened it and then turned\nback.\n\n\"That's all you've got to say, then?\"\n\n\"That's all.\"\n\nHe jerked the door open and passed out. She saw him stop in the\nante-room to pick up his hat and stick, his heavy figure silhouetted\nagainst the glare of the wall-lights. A ray of the same light fell\non her where she stood in the unlit sitting-room, and her reflection\nbloomed out like a flower from the mirror that faced her. She looked\nat the image and waited. Van Degen put his hat on his head and slowly\nopened the door into the outer hall. Then he turned abruptly, his bulk\neclipsing her reflection as he plunged back into the room and came up to\nher.\n\n\"I'll do anything you say. Undine; I'll do anything in God's world to\nkeep you!\"\n\nShe turned her eyes from the mirror and let them rest on his face, which\nlooked as small and withered as an old man's, with a lower lip that\ntrembled queerly....\n\n\n\nXXI\n\nThe spring in New York proceeded through more than its usual extremes of\ntemperature to the threshold of a sultry June.\n\nRalph Marvell, wearily bent to his task, felt the fantastic humours of\nthe weather as only one more incoherence in the general chaos of his\ncase. It was strange enough, after four years of marriage, to find\nhimself again in his old brown room in Washington Square. It was\nhardly there that he had expected Pegasus to land him; and, like a man\nreturning to the scenes of his childhood, he found everything on a much\nsmaller scale than he had imagined. Had the Dagonet boundaries really\nnarrowed, or had the breach in the walls of his own life let in a wider\nvision?\n\nCertainly there had come to be other differences between his present and\nhis former self than that embodied in the presence of his little boy in\nthe next room. Paul, in fact, was now the chief link between Ralph and\nhis past. Concerning his son he still felt and thought, in a general\nway, in the terms of the Dagonet tradition; he still wanted to implant\nin Paul some of the reserves and discriminations which divided that\ntradition from the new spirit of limitless concession. But for himself\nit was different. Since his transaction with Moffatt he had had the\nsense of living under a new dispensation. He was not sure that it was\nany worse than the other; but then he was no longer very sure about\nanything. Perhaps this growing indifference was merely the reaction\nfrom a long nervous strain: that his mother and sister thought it so\nwas shown by the way in which they mutely watched and hovered. Their\ndiscretion was like the hushed tread about a sick-bed. They permitted\nthemselves no criticism of Undine; he was asked no awkward questions,\nsubjected to no ill-timed sympathy. They simply took him back, on his\nown terms, into the life he had left them to; and their silence had none\nof those subtle implications of disapproval which may be so much more\nwounding than speech.\n\nFor a while he received a weekly letter from Undine. Vague and\ndisappointing though they were, these missives helped him through the\ndays; but he looked forward to them rather as a pretext for replies than\nfor their actual contents. Undine was never at a loss for the spoken\nword: Ralph had often wondered at her verbal range and her fluent use of\nterms outside the current vocabulary. She had certainly not picked these\nup in books, since she never opened one: they seemed rather like some\nodd transmission of her preaching grandparent's oratory. But in her\nbrief and colourless letters she repeated the same bald statements\nin the same few terms. She was well, she had been \"round\" with Bertha\nShallum, she had dined with the Jim Driscolls or May Beringer or Dicky\nBowles, the weather was too lovely or too awful; such was the gist of\nher news. On the last page she hoped Paul was well and sent him a kiss;\nbut she never made a suggestion concerning his care or asked a question\nabout his pursuits. One could only infer that, knowing in what good\nhands he was, she judged such solicitude superfluous; and it was thus\nthat Ralph put the matter to his mother.\n\n\"Of course she's not worrying about the boy--why should she? She knows\nthat with you and Laura he's as happy as a king.\"\n\nTo which Mrs. Marvell would answer gravely: \"When you write, be sure\nto say I shan't put on his thinner flannels as long as this east wind\nlasts.\"\n\nAs for her husband's welfare. Undine's sole allusion to it consisted\nin the invariable expression of the hope that he was getting along all\nright: the phrase was always the same, and Ralph learned to know\njust how far down the third page to look for it. In a postscript she\nsometimes asked him to tell her mother about a new way of doing hair or\ncutting a skirt; and this was usually the most eloquent passage of the\nletter. What satisfaction he extracted from these communications he\nwould have found it hard to say; yet when they did not come he missed\nthem hardly less than if they had given him all he craved. Sometimes the\nmere act of holding the blue or mauve sheet and breathing its scent\nwas like holding his wife's hand and being enveloped in her fresh young\nfragrance: the sentimental disappointment vanished in the penetrating\nphysical sensation. In other moods it was enough to trace the letters\nof the first line and the last for the desert of perfunctory phrases\nbetween the two to vanish, leaving him only the vision of their\ninterlaced names, as of a mystic bond which her own hand had tied.\nOr else he saw her, closely, palpably before him, as she sat at her\nwriting-table, frowning and a little flushed, her bent nape showing the\nlight on her hair, her short lip pulled up by the effort of composition;\nand this picture had the violent reality of dream-images on the verge\nof waking. At other times, as he read her letter, he felt simply that at\nleast in the moment of writing it she had been with him. But in one of\nthe last she had said (to excuse a bad blot and an incoherent sentence):\n\"Everybody's talking to me at once, and I don't know what I'm writing.\"\nThat letter he had thrown into the fire....\n\nAfter the first few weeks, the letters came less and less regularly:\nat the end of two months they ceased. Ralph had got into the habit of\nwatching for them on the days when a foreign post was due, and as the\nweeks went by without a sign he began to invent excuses for leaving\nthe office earlier and hurrying back to Washington Square to search\nthe letter-box for a big tinted envelope with a straggling blotted\nsuperscription.\n\nUndine's departure had given him a momentary sense of liberation: at\nthat stage in their relations any change would have brought relief.\nBut now that she was gone he knew she could never really go. Though his\nfeeling for her had changed, it still ruled his life. If he saw her in\nher weakness he felt her in her power: the power of youth and physical\nradiance that clung to his disenchanted memories as the scent she used\nclung to her letters. Looking back at their four years of marriage he\nbegan to ask himself if he had done all he could to draw her half-formed\nspirit from its sleep. Had he not expected too much at first, and grown\ntoo indifferent in the sequel? After all, she was still in the toy age;\nand perhaps the very extravagance of his love had retarded her growth,\nhelped to imprison her in a little circle of frivolous illusions. But\nthe last months had made a man of him, and when she came back he would\nknow how to lift her to the height of his experience.\n\nSo he would reason, day by day, as he hastened back to Washington\nSquare; but when he opened the door, and his first glance at the hall\ntable showed him there was no letter there, his illusions shrivelled\ndown to their weak roots. She had not written: she did not mean to\nwrite. He and the boy were no longer a part of her life. When she\ncame back everything would be as it had been before, with the dreary\ndifference that she had tasted new pleasures and that their absence\nwould take the savour from all he had to give her. Then the coming of\nanother foreign mail would lift his hopes, and as he hurried home he\nwould imagine new reasons for expecting a letter....\n\nWeek after week he swung between the extremes of hope and dejection,\nand at last, when the strain had become unbearable, he cabled her. The\nanswer ran: \"Very well best love writing\"; but the promised letter never\ncame....\n\nHe went on steadily with his work: he even passed through a phase of\nexaggerated energy. But his baffled youth fought in him for air. Was\nthis to be the end? Was he to wear his life out in useless drudgery? The\nplain prose of it, of course, was that the economic situation remained\nunchanged by the sentimental catastrophe and that he must go on working\nfor his wife and child. But at any rate, as it was mainly for Paul that\nhe would henceforth work, it should be on his own terms and according to\nhis inherited notions of \"straightness.\" He would never again engage in\nany transaction resembling his compact with Moffatt. Even now he was not\nsure there had been anything crooked in that; but the fact of his\nhaving instinctively referred the point to Mr. Spragg rather than to his\ngrandfather implied a presumption against it.\n\nHis partners were quick to profit by his sudden spurt of energy, and\nhis work grew no lighter. He was not only the youngest and most recent\nmember of the firm, but the one who had so far added least to the volume\nof its business. His hours were the longest, his absences, as summer\napproached, the least frequent and the most grudgingly accorded. No\ndoubt his associates knew that he was pressed for money and could not\nrisk a break. They \"worked\" him, and he was aware of it, and submitted\nbecause he dared not lose his job. But the long hours of mechanical\ndrudgery were telling on his active body and undisciplined nerves. He\nhad begun too late to subject himself to the persistent mortification of\nspirit and flesh which is a condition of the average business life; and\nafter the long dull days in the office the evenings at his grandfather's\nwhist-table did not give him the counter-stimulus he needed.\n\nAlmost every one had gone out of town; but now and then Miss Ray came\nto dine, and Ralph, seated beneath the family portraits and opposite the\ndesiccated Harriet, who had already faded to the semblance of one of\nher own great-aunts, listened languidly to the kind of talk that the\noriginals might have exchanged about the same table when New York\ngentility centred in the Battery and the Bowling Green. Mr. Dagonet was\nalways pleasant to see and hear, but his sarcasms were growing faint\nand recondite: they had as little bearing on life as the humours of a\nRestoration comedy. As for Mrs. Marvell and Miss Ray, they seemed to the\nyoung man even more spectrally remote: hardly anything that mattered to\nhim existed for them, and their prejudices reminded him of sign-posts\nwarning off trespassers who have long since ceased to intrude.\n\nNow and then he dined at his club and went on to the theatre with some\nyoung men of his own age; but he left them afterward, half vexed with\nhimself for not being in the humour to prolong the adventure. There\nwere moments when he would have liked to affirm his freedom in however\ncommonplace a way: moments when the vulgarest way would have seemed\nthe most satisfying. But he always ended by walking home alone and\ntip-toeing upstairs through the sleeping house lest he should wake his\nboy....\n\nOn Saturday afternoons, when the business world was hurrying to the\ncountry for golf and tennis, he stayed in town and took Paul to see the\nSpraggs. Several times since his wife's departure he had tried to bring\nabout closer relations between his own family and Undine's; and the\nladies of Washington Square, in their eagerness to meet his wishes, had\nmade various friendly advances to Mrs. Spragg. But they were met by a\nmute resistance which made Ralph suspect that Undine's strictures on his\nfamily had taken root in her mother's brooding mind; and he gave up the\nstruggle to bring together what had been so effectually put asunder.\n\nIf he regretted his lack of success it was chiefly because he was so\nsorry for the Spraggs. Soon after Undine's marriage they had abandoned\ntheir polychrome suite at the Stentorian, and since then their\nperegrinations had carried them through half the hotels of the\nmetropolis. Undine, who had early discovered her mistake in thinking\nhotel life fashionable, had tried to persuade her parents to take a\nhouse of their own; but though they refrained from taxing her with\ninconsistency they did not act on her suggestion. Mrs. Spragg seemed\nto shrink from the thought of \"going back to house-keeping,\" and Ralph\nsuspected that she depended on the transit from hotel to hotel as the\none element of variety in her life. As for Mr. Spragg, it was impossible\nto imagine any one in whom the domestic sentiments were more completely\nunlocalized and disconnected from any fixed habits; and he was probably\naware of his changes of abode chiefly as they obliged him to ascend from\nthe Subway, or descend from the \"Elevated,\" a few blocks higher up or\nlower down.\n\nNeither husband nor wife complained to Ralph of their frequent\ndisplacements, or assigned to them any cause save the vague one of\n\"guessing they could do better\"; but Ralph noticed that the decreasing\nluxury of their life synchronized with Undine's growing demands for\nmoney. During the last few months they had transferred themselves to the\n\"Malibran,\" a tall narrow structure resembling a grain-elevator divided\ninto cells, where linoleum and lincrusta simulated the stucco and marble\nof the Stentorian, and fagged business men and their families consumed\nthe watery stews dispensed by \"coloured help\" in the grey twilight of a\nbasement dining-room.\n\nMrs. Spragg had no sitting-room, and Paul and his father had to be\nreceived in one of the long public parlours, between ladies seated at\nrickety desks in the throes of correspondence and groups of listlessly\nconversing residents and callers.\n\nThe Spraggs were intensely proud of their grandson, and Ralph perceived\nthat they would have liked to see Paul charging uproariously from group\nto group, and thrusting his bright curls and cherubic smile upon the\ngeneral attention. The fact that the boy preferred to stand between his\ngrandfather's knees and play with Mr. Spragg's Masonic emblem, or dangle\nhis legs from the arm of Mrs. Spragg's chair, seemed to his grandparents\nevidence of ill-health or undue repression, and he was subjected by Mrs.\nSpragg to searching enquiries as to how his food set, and whether he\ndidn't think his Popper was too strict with him. A more embarrassing\nproblem was raised by the \"surprise\" (in the shape of peanut candy or\nchocolate creams) which he was invited to hunt for in Gran'ma's pockets,\nand which Ralph had to confiscate on the way home lest the dietary rules\nof Washington Square should be too visibly infringed.\n\nSometimes Ralph found Mrs. Heeny, ruddy and jovial, seated in the\narm-chair opposite Mrs. Spragg, and regaling her with selections from a\nnew batch of clippings. During Undine's illness of the previous winter\nMrs. Heeny had become a familiar figure to Paul, who had learned to\nexpect almost as much from her bag as from his grandmother's pockets; so\nthat the intemperate Saturdays at the Malibran were usually followed by\nlanguid and abstemious Sundays in Washington Square. Mrs. Heeny, being\nunaware of this sequel to her bounties, formed the habit of appearing\nregularly on Saturdays, and while she chatted with his grandmother the\nlittle boy was encouraged to scatter the grimy carpet with face-creams\nand bunches of clippings in his thrilling quest for the sweets at the\nbottom of her bag.\n\n\"I declare, if he ain't in just as much of a hurry f'r everything as his\nmother!\" she exclaimed one day in her rich rolling voice; and stooping\nto pick up a long strip of newspaper which Paul had flung aside she\nadded, as she smoothed it out: \"I guess 'f he was a little mite older\nhe'd be better pleased with this 'n with the candy. It's the very thing\nI was trying to find for you the other day, Mrs. Spragg,\" she went on,\nholding the bit of paper at arm's length; and she began to read out,\nwith a loudness proportioned to the distance between her eyes and the\ntext:\n\n\"With two such sprinters as 'Pete' Van Degen and Dicky Bowles to set\nthe pace, it's no wonder the New York set in Paris has struck a livelier\ngait than ever this spring. It's a high-pressure season and no mistake,\nand no one lags behind less than the fascinating Mrs. Ralph Marvell,\nwho is to be seen daily and nightly in all the smartest restaurants and\nnaughtiest theatres, with so many devoted swains in attendance that the\nrival beauties of both worlds are said to be making catty comments. But\nthen Mrs. Marvell's gowns are almost as good as her looks--and how can\nyou expect the other women to stand for such a monopoly?\"\n\nTo escape the strain of these visits, Ralph once or twice tried the\nexperiment of leaving Paul with his grand-parents and calling for him in\nthe late afternoon; but one day, on re-entering the Malibran, he was\nmet by a small abashed figure clad in a kaleidoscopic tartan and a\ngreen velvet cap with a silver thistle. After this experience of the\n\"surprises\" of which Gran'ma was capable when she had a chance to take\nPaul shopping Ralph did not again venture to leave his son, and their\nsubsequent Saturdays were passed together in the sultry gloom of the\nMalibran. Conversation with the Spraggs was almost impossible. Ralph\ncould talk with his father-in-law in his office, but in the hotel\nparlour Mr. Spragg sat in a ruminating silence broken only by the\nemission of an occasional \"Well--well\" addressed to his grandson. As for\nMrs. Spragg, her son-in-law could not remember having had a sustained\nconversation with her since the distant day when he had first called at\nthe Stentorian, and had been \"entertained,\" in Undine's absence, by her\nastonished mother. The shock of that encounter had moved Mrs. Spragg to\neloquence; but Ralph's entrance into the family, without making him seem\nless of a stranger, appeared once for all to have relieved her of the\nobligation of finding something to say to him.\n\nThe one question she invariably asked: \"You heard from Undie?\" had been\nrelatively easy to answer while his wife's infrequent letters continued\nto arrive; but a Saturday came when he felt the blood rise to his\ntemples as, for the fourth consecutive week, he stammered out, under the\nsnapping eyes of Mrs. Heeny: \"No, not by this post either--I begin to\nthink I must have lost a letter\"; and it was then that Mr. Spragg,\nwho had sat silently looking up at the ceiling, cut short his wife's\nexclamation by an enquiry about real estate in the Bronx. After that,\nRalph noticed, Mrs. Spragg never again renewed her question; and he\nunderstood that his father-in-law had guessed his embarrassment and\nwished to spare it.\n\nRalph had never thought of looking for any delicacy of feeling under\nMr. Spragg's large lazy irony, and the incident drew the two men nearer\ntogether. Mrs. Spragg, for her part, was certainly not delicate; but\nshe was simple and without malice, and Ralph liked her for her silent\nacceptance of her diminished state. Sometimes, as he sat between the\nlonely primitive old couple, he wondered from what source Undine's\nvoracious ambitions had been drawn: all she cared for, and attached\nimportance to, was as remote from her parents' conception of life as her\nimpatient greed from their passive stoicism.\n\nOne hot afternoon toward the end of June Ralph suddenly wondered if\nClare Van Degen were still in town. She had dined in Washington Square\nsome ten days earlier, and he remembered her saying that she had sent\nthe children down to Long Island, but that she herself meant to stay on\nin town till the heat grew unbearable. She hated her big showy place on\nLong Island, she was tired of the spring trip to London and Paris, where\none met at every turn the faces one had grown sick of seeing all winter,\nand she declared that in the early summer New York was the only place in\nwhich one could escape from New Yorkers... She put the case amusingly,\nand it was like her to take up any attitude that went against the habits\nof her set; but she lived at the mercy of her moods, and one could never\ntell how long any one of them would rule her.\n\nAs he sat in his office, with the noise and glare of the endless\nafternoon rising up in hot waves from the street, there wandered into\nRalph's mind a vision of her shady drawing-room. All day it hung before\nhim like the mirage of a spring before a dusty traveller: he felt a\npositive thirst for her presence, for the sound of her voice, the wide\nspaces and luxurious silences surrounding her.\n\nIt was perhaps because, on that particular day, a spiral pain was\ntwisting around in the back of his head, and digging in a little deeper\nwith each twist, and because the figures on the balance sheet before him\nwere hopping about like black imps in an infernal forward-and-back, that\nthe picture hung there so persistently. It was a long time since he had\nwanted anything as much as, at that particular moment, he wanted to\nbe with Clare and hear her voice; and as soon as he had ground out the\nday's measure of work he rang up the Van Degen palace and learned that\nshe was still in town.\n\nThe lowered awnings of her inner drawing-room cast a luminous shadow on\nold cabinets and consoles, and on the pale flowers scattered here and\nthere in vases of bronze and porcelain. Clare's taste was as capricious\nas her moods, and the rest of the house was not in harmony with this\nroom. There was, in particular, another drawing-room, which she now\ndescribed as Peter's creation, but which Ralph knew to be partly hers: a\nheavily decorated apartment, where Popple's portrait of her throned over\na waste of gilt furniture. It was characteristic that to-day she had\nhad Ralph shown in by another way; and that, as she had spared him the\npolyphonic drawing-room, so she had skilfully adapted her own appearance\nto her soberer background. She sat near the window, reading, in a clear\ncool dress: and at his entrance she merely slipped a finger between the\npages and looked up at him.\n\nHer way of receiving him made him feel that restlessness and stridency\nwere as unlike her genuine self as the gilded drawing-room, and that\nthis quiet creature was the only real Clare, the Clare who had once been\nso nearly his, and who seemed to want him to know that she had never\nwholly been any one else's.\n\n\"Why didn't you let me know you were still in town?\" he asked, as he sat\ndown in the sofa-corner near her chair.\n\nHer dark smile deepened. \"I hoped you'd come and see.\"\n\n\"One never knows, with you.\"\n\nHe was looking about the room with a kind of confused pleasure in its\npale shadows and spots of dark rich colour. The old lacquer screen\nbehind Clare's head looked like a lustreless black pool with gold leaves\nfloating on it; and another piece, a little table at her elbow, had the\nbrown bloom and the pear-like curves of an old violin.\n\n\"I like to be here,\" Ralph said.\n\nShe did not make the mistake of asking: \"Then why do you never come?\"\nInstead, she turned away and drew an inner curtain across the window to\nshut out the sunlight which was beginning to slant in under the awning.\n\nThe mere fact of her not answering, and the final touch of well-being\nwhich her gesture gave, reminded him of other summer days they had spent\ntogether long rambling boy-and-girl days in the hot woods and fields,\nwhen they had never thought of talking to each other unless there was\nsomething they particularly wanted to say. His tired fancy strayed off\nfor a second to the thought of what it would have been like come back,\nat the end of the day, to such a sweet community of silence; but his\nmind was too crowded with importunate facts for any lasting view of\nvisionary distances. The thought faded, and he merely felt how restful\nit was to have her near...\n\n\"I'm glad you stayed in town: you must let me come again,\" he said.\n\n\"I suppose you can't always get away,\" she answered; and she began to\nlisten, with grave intelligent eyes, to his description of his tedious\ndays.\n\nWith her eyes on him he felt the exquisite relief of talking about\nhimself as he had not dared to talk to any one since his marriage.\nHe would not for the world have confessed his discouragement, his\nconsciousness of incapacity; to Undine and in Washington Square any\nhint of failure would have been taken as a criticism of what his wife\ndemanded of him. Only to Clare Van Degen could he cry out his present\ndespondency and his loathing of the interminable task ahead.\n\n\"A man doesn't know till he tries it how killing uncongenial work is,\nand how it destroys the power of doing what one's fit for, even if\nthere's time for both. But there's Paul to be looked out for, and I\ndaren't chuck my job--I'm in mortal terror of its chucking me...\"\n\nLittle by little he slipped into a detailed recital of all his lesser\nworries, the most recent of which was his experience with the Lipscombs,\nwho, after a two months' tenancy of the West End Avenue house, had\ndecamped without paying their rent.\n\nClare laughed contemptuously. \"Yes--I heard he'd come to grief and been\nsuspended from the Stock Exchange, and I see in the papers that his\nwife's retort has been to sue for a divorce.\"\n\nRalph knew that, like all their clan, his cousin regarded a divorce-suit\nas a vulgar and unnecessary way of taking the public into one's\nconfidence. His mind flashed back to the family feast in Washington\nSquare in celebration of his engagement. He recalled his grandfather's\nchance allusion to Mrs. Lipscomb, and Undine's answer, fluted out on her\nhighest note: \"Oh, I guess she'll get a divorce pretty soon. He's been a\ndisappointment to her.\"\n\nRalph could still hear the horrified murmur with which his mother had\nrebuked his laugh. For he had laughed--had thought Undine's speech fresh\nand natural! Now he felt the ironic rebound of her words. Heaven knew he\nhad been a disappointment to her; and what was there in her own feeling,\nor in her inherited prejudices, to prevent her seeking the same redress\nas Mabel Lipscomb? He wondered if the same thought were in his cousin's\nmind...\n\nThey began to talk of other things: books, pictures, plays; and one\nby one the closed doors opened and light was let into dusty shuttered\nplaces. Clare's mind was neither keen nor deep: Ralph, in the past, had\nsmiled at her rash ardours and vague intensities. But she had his own\nrange of allusions, and a great gift of momentary understanding; and\nhe had so long beaten his thoughts out against a blank wall of\nincomprehension that her sympathy seemed full of insight.\n\nShe began by a question about his writing, but the subject was\ndistasteful to him, and he turned the talk to a new book in which he had\nbeen interested. She knew enough of it to slip in the right word here\nand there; and thence they wandered on to kindred topics. Under the\nwarmth of her attention his torpid ideas awoke again, and his eyes\ntook their fill of pleasure as she leaned forward, her thin brown hands\nclasped on her knees and her eager face reflecting all his feelings.\n\nThere was a moment when the two currents of sensation were merged in\none, and he began to feel confusedly that he was young and she was kind,\nand that there was nothing he would like better than to go on sitting\nthere, not much caring what she said or how he answered, if only she\nwould let him look at her and give him one of her thin brown hands to\nhold. Then the corkscrew in the back of his head dug into him again with\na deeper thrust, and she seemed suddenly to recede to a great distance\nand be divided from him by a fog of pain. The fog lifted after a minute,\nbut it left him queerly remote from her, from the cool room with its\nscents and shadows, and from all the objects which, a moment before, had\nso sharply impinged upon his senses. It was as though he looked at it\nall through a rain-blurred pane, against which his hand would strike if\nhe held it out to her...\n\nThat impression passed also, and he found himself thinking how tired he\nwas and how little anything mattered. He recalled the unfinished piece\nof work on his desk, and for a moment had the odd illusion that it was\nthere before him...\n\nShe exclaimed: \"But are you going?\" and her exclamation made him aware\nthat he had left his seat and was standing in front of her... He fancied\nthere was some kind of appeal in her brown eyes; but she was so dim and\nfar off that he couldn't be sure of what she wanted, and the next moment\nhe found himself shaking hands with her, and heard her saying something\nkind and cold about its having been so nice to see him...\n\nHalf way up the stairs little Paul, shining and rosy from supper, lurked\nin ambush for his evening game. Ralph was fond of stooping down to let\nthe boy climb up his outstretched arms to his shoulders, but to-day, as\nhe did so, Paul's hug seemed to crush him in a vice, and the shout\nof welcome that accompanied it racked his ears like an explosion of\nsteam-whistles. The queer distance between himself and the rest of the\nworld was annihilated again: everything stared and glared and clutched\nhim. He tried to turn away his face from the child's hot kisses; and as\nhe did so he caught sight of a mauve envelope among the hats and sticks\non the hall table.\n\nInstantly he passed Paul over to his nurse, stammered out a word about\nbeing tired, and sprang up the long flights to his study. The pain\nin his head had stopped, but his hands trembled as he tore open the\nenvelope. Within it was a second letter bearing a French stamp and\naddressed to himself. It looked like a business communication and had\napparently been sent to Undine's hotel in Paris and forwarded to him by\nher hand. \"Another bill!\" he reflected grimly, as he threw it aside and\nfelt in the outer envelope for her letter. There was nothing there, and\nafter a first sharp pang of disappointment he picked up the enclosure\nand opened it.\n\nInside was a lithographed circular, headed \"Confidential\" and bearing\nthe Paris address of a firm of private detectives who undertook,\nin conditions of attested and inviolable discretion, to investigate\n\"delicate\" situations, look up doubtful antecedents, and furnish\nreliable evidence of misconduct--all on the most reasonable terms.\n\nFor a long time Ralph sat and stared at this document; then he began to\nlaugh and tossed it into the scrap-basket. After that, with a groan, he\ndropped his head against the edge of his writing table.\n\n\n\nXXII\n\nWhen he woke, the first thing he remembered was the fact of having\ncried.\n\nHe could not think how he had come to be such a fool. He hoped to heaven\nno one had seen him. He supposed he must have been worrying about the\nunfinished piece of work at the office: where was it, by the way, he\nwondered? Why--where he had left it the day before, of course! What a\nridiculous thing to worry about--but it seemed to follow him about like\na dog...\n\nHe said to himself that he must get up presently and go down to the\noffice. Presently--when he could open his eyes. Just now there was a\ndead weight on them; he tried one after another in vain. The effort set\nhim weakly trembling, and he wanted to cry again. Nonsense! He must get\nout of bed.\n\nHe stretched his arms out, trying to reach something to pull himself up\nby; but everything slipped away and evaded him. It was like trying\nto catch at bright short waves. Then suddenly his fingers clasped\nthemselves about something firm and warm. A hand: a hand that gave back\nhis pressure! The relief was inexpressible. He lay still and let the\nhand hold him, while mentally he went through the motions of getting\nup and beginning to dress. So indistinct were the boundaries between\nthought and action that he really felt himself moving about the room,\nin a queer disembodied way, as one treads the air in sleep. Then he felt\nthe bedclothes over him and the pillows under his head.\n\n\"I MUST get up,\" he said, and pulled at the hand.\n\nIt pressed him down again: down into a dim deep pool of sleep. He lay\nthere for a long time, in a silent blackness far below light and sound;\nthen he gradually floated to the surface with the buoyancy of a dead\nbody. But his body had never been more alive. Jagged strokes of pain\ntore through it, hands dragged at it with nails that bit like teeth.\nThey wound thongs about him, bound him, tied weights to him, tried to\npull him down with them; but still he floated, floated, danced on the\nfiery waves of pain, with barbed light pouring down on him from an\narrowy sky.\n\nCharmed intervals of rest, blue sailings on melodious seas, alternated\nwith the anguish. He became a leaf on the air, a feather on a current, a\nstraw on the tide, the spray of the wave spinning itself to sunshine as\nthe wave toppled over into gulfs of blue...\n\nHe woke on a stony beach, his legs and arms still lashed to his sides\nand the thongs cutting into him; but the fierce sky was hidden, and\nhidden by his own languid lids. He felt the ecstasy of decreasing pain,\nand courage came to him to open his eyes and look about him...\n\nThe beach was his own bed; the tempered light lay on familiar things,\nand some one was moving about in a shadowy way between bed and window.\nHe was thirsty and some one gave him a drink. His pillow burned, and\nsome one turned the cool side out. His brain was clear enough now for\nhim to understand that he was ill, and to want to talk about it; but his\ntongue hung in his throat like a clapper in a bell. He must wait till\nthe rope was pulled...\n\nSo time and life stole back on him, and his thoughts laboured weakly\nwith dim fears. Slowly he cleared a way through them, adjusted himself\nto his strange state, and found out that he was in his own room, in his\ngrandfather's house, that alternating with the white-capped faces about\nhim were those of his mother and sister, and that in a few days--if he\ntook his beef-tea and didn't fret--Paul would be brought up from Long\nIsland, whither, on account of the great heat, he had been carried off\nby Clare Van Degen.\n\nNo one named Undine to him, and he did not speak of her. But one day,\nas he lay in bed in the summer twilight, he had a vision of a moment,\na long way behind him--at the beginning of his illness, it must have\nbeen--when he had called out for her in his anguish, and some one had\nsaid: \"She's coming: she'll be here next week.\"\n\nCould it be that next week was not yet here? He supposed that illness\nrobbed one of all sense of time, and he lay still, as if in ambush,\nwatching his scattered memories come out one by one and join themselves\ntogether. If he watched long enough he was sure he should recognize one\nthat fitted into his picture of the day when he had asked for Undine.\nAnd at length a face came out of the twilight: a freckled face,\nbenevolently bent over him under a starched cap. He had not seen the\nface for a long time, but suddenly it took shape and fitted itself into\nthe picture...\n\nLaura Fairford sat near by, a book on her knee. At the sound of his\nvoice she looked up.\n\n\"What was the name of the first nurse?\"\n\n\"The first--?\"\n\n\"The one that went away.\"\n\n\"Oh--Miss Hicks, you mean?\"\n\n\"How long is it since she went?\"\n\n\"It must be three weeks. She had another case.\"\n\nHe thought this over carefully; then he spoke again. \"Call Undine.\"\n\nShe made no answer, and he repeated irritably: \"Why don't you call her?\nI want to speak to her.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford laid down her book and came to him.\n\n\"She's not here--just now.\"\n\nHe dealt with this also, laboriously. \"You mean she's out--she's not in\nthe house?\"\n\n\"I mean she hasn't come yet.\"\n\nAs she spoke Ralph felt a sudden strength and hardness in his brain and\nbody. Everything in him became as clear as noon.\n\n\"But it was before Miss Hicks left that you told me you'd sent for her,\nand that she'd be here the following week. And you say Miss Hicks has\nbeen gone three weeks.\"\n\nThis was what he had worked out in his head, and what he meant to say\nto his sister; but something seemed to snap shut in his throat, and he\nclosed his eyes without speaking.\n\nEven when Mr. Spragg came to see him he said nothing. They talked about\nhis illness, about the hot weather, about the rumours that Harmon B.\nDriscoll was again threatened with indictment; and then Mr. Spragg\npulled himself out of his chair and said: \"I presume you'll call round\nat the office before you leave the city.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes: as soon as I'm up,\" Ralph answered. They understood each\nother.\n\nClare had urged him to come down to Long Island and complete his\nconvalescence there, but he preferred to stay in Washington Square till\nhe should be strong enough for the journey to the Adirondacks, whither\nLaura had already preceded him with Paul. He did not want to see any\none but his mother and grandfather till his legs could carry him to Mr.\nSpragg's office. It was an oppressive day in mid-August, with a\nyellow mist of heat in the sky, when at last he entered the big\noffice-building. Swirls of dust lay on the mosaic floor, and a stale\nsmell of decayed fruit and salt air and steaming asphalt filled the\nplace like a fog. As he shot up in the elevator some one slapped him\non the back, and turning he saw Elmer Moffatt at his side, smooth and\nrubicund under a new straw hat.\n\nMoffatt was loudly glad to see him. \"I haven't laid eyes on you for\nmonths. At the old stand still?\"\n\n\"So am I,\" he added, as Ralph assented. \"Hope to see you there again\nsome day. Don't forget it's MY turn this time: glad if I can be any use\nto you. So long.\" Ralph's weak bones ached under his handshake.\n\n\"How's Mrs. Marvell?\" he turned back from his landing to call out; and\nRalph answered: \"Thanks; she's very well.\"\n\nMr. Spragg sat alone in his murky inner office, the fly-blown engraving\nof Daniel Webster above his head and the congested scrap-basket beneath\nhis feet. He looked fagged and sallow, like the day.\n\nRalph sat down on the other side of the desk. For a moment his throat\ncontracted as it had when he had tried to question his sister; then he\nasked: \"Where's Undine?\"\n\nMr. Spragg glanced at the calendar that hung from a hat-peg on the door.\nThen he released the Masonic emblem from his grasp, drew out his watch\nand consulted it critically.\n\n\"If the train's on time I presume she's somewhere between Chicago and\nOmaha round about now.\"\n\nRalph stared at him, wondering if the heat had gone to his head. \"I\ndon't understand.\"\n\n\"The Twentieth Century's generally considered the best route to Dakota,\"\nexplained Mr. Spragg, who pronounced the word ROWT.\n\n\"Do you mean to say Undine's in the United States?\"\n\nMr. Spragg's lower lip groped for the phantom tooth-pick. \"Why, let me\nsee: hasn't Dakota been a state a year or two now?\"\n\n\"Oh, God--\" Ralph cried, pushing his chair back violently and striding\nacross the narrow room.\n\nAs he turned, Mr. Spragg stood up and advanced a few steps. He had given\nup the quest for the tooth-pick, and his drawn-in lips were no more\nthan a narrow depression in his beard. He stood before Ralph, absently\nshaking the loose change in his trouser-pockets.\n\nRalph felt the same hardness and lucidity that had come to him when he\nhad heard his sister's answer.\n\n\"She's gone, you mean? Left me? With another man?\"\n\nMr. Spragg drew himself up with a kind of slouching majesty. \"My\ndaughter is not that style. I understand Undine thinks there have been\nmistakes on both sides. She considers the tie was formed too hastily. I\nbelieve desertion is the usual plea in such cases.\"\n\nRalph stared about him, hardly listening. He did not resent his\nfather-in-law's tone. In a dim way he guessed that Mr. Spragg was\nsuffering hardly less than himself. But nothing was clear to him save\nthe monstrous fact suddenly upheaved in his path. His wife had left him,\nand the plan for her evasion had been made and executed while he lay\nhelpless: she had seized the opportunity of his illness to keep him in\nignorance of her design. The humour of it suddenly struck him and he\nlaughed.\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me that Undine's divorcing ME?\"\n\n\"I presume that's her plan,\" Mr. Spragg admitted.\n\n\"For desertion?\" Ralph pursued, still laughing.\n\nHis father-in-law hesitated a moment; then he answered: \"You've always\ndone all you could for my daughter. There wasn't any other plea she\ncould think of. She presumed this would be the most agreeable to your\nfamily.\"\n\n\"It was good of her to think of that!\"\n\nMr. Spragg's only comment was a sigh.\n\n\"Does she imagine I won't fight it?\" Ralph broke out with sudden\npassion.\n\nHis father-in-law looked at him thoughtfully. \"I presume you realize it\nain't easy to change Undine, once she's set on a thing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not. But if she really means to apply for a divorce I can make\nit a little less easy for her to get.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" Mr. Spragg conceded. He turned back to his revolving chair,\nand seating himself in it began to drum on the desk with cigar-stained\nfingers.\n\n\"And by God, I will!\" Ralph thundered. Anger was the only emotion in him\nnow. He had been fooled, cheated, made a mock of; but the score was not\nsettled yet. He turned back and stood before Mr. Spragg.\n\n\"I suppose she's gone with Van Degen?\"\n\n\"My daughter's gone alone, sir. I saw her off at the station. I\nunderstood she was to join a lady friend.\"\n\nAt every point Ralph felt his hold slip off the surface of his\nfather-in-law's impervious fatalism.\n\n\"Does she suppose Van Degen's going to marry her?\"\n\n\"Undine didn't mention her future plans to me.\" After a moment Mr.\nSpragg appended: \"If she had, I should have declined to discuss them\nwith her.\" Ralph looked at him curiously, perceiving that he intended in\nthis negative way to imply his disapproval of his daughter's course.\n\n\"I shall fight it--I shall fight it!\" the young man cried again. \"You\nmay tell her I shall fight it to the end!\"\n\nMr. Spragg pressed the nib of his pen against the dust-coated inkstand.\n\"I suppose you would have to engage a lawyer. She'll know it that way,\"\nhe remarked.\n\n\"She'll know it--you may count on that!\"\n\nRalph had begun to laugh again. Suddenly he heard his own laugh and it\npulled him up. What was he laughing about? What was he talking about?\nThe thing was to act--to hold his tongue and act. There was no use\nuttering windy threats to this broken-spirited old man.\n\nA fury of action burned in Ralph, pouring light into his mind and\nstrength into his muscles. He caught up his hat and turned to the door.\n\nAs he opened it Mr. Spragg rose again and came forward with his slow\nshambling step. He laid his hand on Ralph's arm.\n\n\"I'd 'a' given anything--anything short of my girl herself--not to have\nthis happen to you, Ralph Marvell.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" said Ralph.\n\nThey looked at each other for a moment; then Mr. Spragg added: \"But\nit HAS happened, you know. Bear that in mind. Nothing you can do will\nchange it. Time and again, I've found that a good thing to remember.\"\n\n\n\nXXIII\n\nIn the Adirondacks Ralph Marvell sat day after day on the balcony of\nhis little house above the lake, staring at the great white\ncloud-reflections in the water and at the dark line of trees that closed\nthem in. Now and then he got into the canoe and paddled himself through\na winding chain of ponds to some lonely clearing in the forest; and\nthere he lay on his back in the pine-needles and watched the great\nclouds form and dissolve themselves above his head.\n\nAll his past life seemed to be symbolized by the building-up and\nbreaking-down of those fluctuating shapes, which incalculable\nwind-currents perpetually shifted and remodelled or swept from the\nzenith like a pinch of dust. His sister told him that he looked\nwell--better than he had in years; and there were moments when his\nlistlessness, his stony insensibility to the small pricks and frictions\nof daily life, might have passed for the serenity of recovered health.\n\nThere was no one with whom he could speak of Undine. His family had\nthrown over the whole subject a pall of silence which even Laura\nFairford shrank from raising. As for his mother, Ralph had seen at once\nthat the idea of talking over the situation was positively frightening\nto her. There was no provision for such emergencies in the moral order\nof Washington Square. The affair was a \"scandal,\" and it was not in\nthe Dagonet tradition to acknowledge the existence of scandals. Ralph\nrecalled a dim memory of his childhood, the tale of a misguided friend\nof his mother's who had left her husband for a more congenial companion,\nand who, years later, returning ill and friendless to New York, had\nappealed for sympathy to Mrs. Marvell. The latter had not refused to\ngive it; but she had put on her black cashmere and two veils when she\nwent to see her unhappy friend, and had never mentioned these errands of\nmercy to her husband.\n\nRalph suspected that the constraint shown by his mother and sister\nwas partly due to their having but a dim and confused view of what had\nhappened. In their vocabulary the word \"divorce\" was wrapped in such a\ndark veil of innuendo as no ladylike hand would care to lift. They had\nnot reached the point of differentiating divorces, but classed them\nindistinctively as disgraceful incidents, in which the woman was always\nto blame, but the man, though her innocent victim, was yet inevitably\ncontaminated. The time involved in the \"proceedings\" was viewed as a\npenitential season during which it behoved the family of the persons\nconcerned to behave as if they were dead; yet any open allusion to the\nreason for adopting such an attitude would have been regarded as the\nheight of indelicacy.\n\nMr. Dagonet's notion of the case was almost as remote from reality. All\nhe asked was that his grandson should \"thrash\" somebody, and he could\nnot be made to understand that the modern drama of divorce is sometimes\ncast without a Lovelace.\n\n\"You might as well tell me there was nobody but Adam in the garden when\nEve picked the apple. You say your wife was discontented? No woman ever\nknows she's discontented till some man tells her so. My God! I've seen\nsmash-ups before now; but I never yet saw a marriage dissolved like\na business partnership. Divorce without a lover? Why, it's--it's as\nunnatural as getting drunk on lemonade.\"\n\nAfter this first explosion Mr. Dagonet also became silent; and Ralph\nperceived that what annoyed him most was the fact of the \"scandal's\" not\nbeing one in any gentlemanly sense of the word. It was like some nasty\nbusiness mess, about which Mr. Dagonet couldn't pretend to have an\nopinion, since such things didn't happen to men of his kind. That such\na thing should have happened to his only grandson was probably the\nbitterest experience of his pleasantly uneventful life; and it added a\ntouch of irony to Ralph's unhappiness to know how little, in the whole\naffair, he was cutting the figure Mr. Dagonet expected him to cut.\n\nAt first he had chafed under the taciturnity surrounding him: had\npassionately longed to cry out his humiliation, his rebellion, his\ndespair. Then he began to feel the tonic effect of silence; and the next\nstage was reached when it became clear to him that there was nothing to\nsay. There were thoughts and thoughts: they bubbled up perpetually\nfrom the black springs of his hidden misery, they stole on him in the\ndarkness of night, they blotted out the light of day; but when it came\nto putting them into words and applying them to the external facts\nof the case, they seemed totally unrelated to it. One more white and\nsun-touched glory had gone from his sky; but there seemed no way of\nconnecting that with such practical issues as his being called on to\ndecide whether Paul was to be put in knickerbockers or trousers, and\nwhether he should go back to Washington Square for the winter or hire a\nsmall house for himself and his son.\n\nThe latter question was ultimately decided by his remaining under his\ngrandfather's roof. November found him back in the office again, in\nfairly good health, with an outer skin of indifference slowly forming\nover his lacerated soul. There had been a hard minute to live through\nwhen he came back to his old brown room in Washington Square. The walls\nand tables were covered with photographs of Undine: effigies of all\nshapes and sizes, expressing every possible sentiment dear to the\nphotographic tradition. Ralph had gathered them all up when he had\nmoved from West End Avenue after Undine's departure for Europe, and they\nthroned over his other possessions as her image had throned over his\nfuture the night he had sat in that very room and dreamed of soaring up\nwith her into the blue...\n\nIt was impossible to go on living with her photographs about him; and\none evening, going up to his room after dinner, he began to unhang them\nfrom the walls, and to gather them up from book-shelves and mantel-piece\nand tables. Then he looked about for some place in which to hide them.\nThere were drawers under his book-cases; but they were full of old\ndiscarded things, and even if he emptied the drawers, the photographs,\nin their heavy frames, were almost all too large to fit into them. He\nturned next to the top shelf of his cupboard; but here the nurse had\nstored Paul's old toys, his sand-pails, shovels and croquet-box. Every\ncorner was packed with the vain impedimenta of living, and the mere\nthought of clearing a space in the chaos was too great an effort.\n\nHe began to replace the pictures one by one; and the last was still in\nhis hand when he heard his sister's voice outside. He hurriedly put\nthe portrait back in its usual place on his writing-table, and Mrs.\nFairford, who had been dining in Washington Square, and had come up to\nbid him good night, flung her arms about him in a quick embrace and went\ndown to her carriage.\n\nThe next afternoon, when he came home from the office, he did not at\nfirst see any change in his room; but when he had lit his pipe and\nthrown himself into his arm-chair he noticed that the photograph of his\nwife's picture by Popple no longer faced him from the mantel-piece. He\nturned to his writing-table, but her image had vanished from there too;\nthen his eye, making the circuit of the walls, perceived that they also\nhad been stripped. Not a single photograph of Undine was left; yet\nso adroitly had the work of elimination been done, so ingeniously the\nremaining objects readjusted, that the change attracted no attention.\n\nRalph was angry, sore, ashamed. He felt as if Laura, whose hand he\ninstantly detected, had taken a cruel pleasure in her work, and for an\ninstant he hated her for it. Then a sense of relief stole over him. He\nwas glad he could look about him without meeting Undine's eyes, and he\nunderstood that what had been done to his room he must do to his memory\nand his imagination: he must so readjust his mind that, whichever way\nhe turned his thoughts, her face should no longer confront him. But\nthat was a task that Laura could not perform for him, a task to be\naccomplished only by the hard continuous tension of his will.\n\nWith the setting in of the mood of silence all desire to fight his\nwife's suit died out. The idea of touching publicly on anything that had\npassed between himself and Undine had become unthinkable. Insensibly he\nhad been subdued to the point of view about him, and the idea of calling\non the law to repair his shattered happiness struck him as even more\ngrotesque than it was degrading. Nevertheless, some contradictory\nimpulse of his divided spirit made him resent, on the part of his mother\nand sister, a too-ready acceptance of his attitude. There were moments\nwhen their tacit assumption that his wife was banished and forgotten\nirritated him like the hushed tread of sympathizers about the bed of an\ninvalid who will not admit that he suffers.\n\nHis irritation was aggravated by the discovery that Mrs. Marvell and\nLaura had already begun to treat Paul as if he were an orphan. One day,\ncoming unnoticed into the nursery, Ralph heard the boy ask when his\nmother was coming back; and Mrs. Fairford, who was with him, answered:\n\"She's not coming back, dearest; and you're not to speak of her to\nfather.\"\n\nRalph, when the boy was out of hearing, rebuked his sister for her\nanswer. \"I don't want you to talk of his mother as if she were dead. I\ndon't want you to forbid Paul to speak of her.\"\n\nLaura, though usually so yielding, defended herself. \"What's the use of\nencouraging him to speak of her when he's never to see her? The sooner\nhe forgets her the better.\"\n\nRalph pondered. \"Later--if she asks to see him--I shan't refuse.\"\n\nMrs. Fairford pressed her lips together to check the answer: \"She never\nwill!\"\n\nRalph heard it, nevertheless, and let it pass. Nothing gave him so\nprofound a sense of estrangement from his former life as the conviction\nthat his sister was probably right. He did not really believe that\nUndine would ever ask to see her boy; but if she did he was determined\nnot to refuse her request.\n\nTime wore on, the Christmas holidays came and went, and the winter\ncontinued to grind out the weary measure of its days. Toward the end\nof January Ralph received a registered letter, addressed to him at his\noffice, and bearing in the corner of the envelope the names of a firm of\nSioux Falls attorneys. He instantly divined that it contained the legal\nnotification of his wife's application for divorce, and as he wrote\nhis name in the postman's book he smiled grimly at the thought that\nthe stroke of his pen was doubtless signing her release. He opened the\nletter, found it to be what he had expected, and locked it away in his\ndesk without mentioning the matter to any one.\n\nHe supposed that with the putting away of this document he was thrusting\nthe whole subject out of sight; but not more than a fortnight later, as\nhe sat in the Subway on his way down-town, his eye was caught by his\nown name on the first page of the heavily head-lined paper which the\nunshaved occupant of the next seat held between grimy fists. The blood\nrushed to Ralph's forehead as he looked over the man's arm and read:\n\"Society Leader Gets Decree,\" and beneath it the subordinate clause:\n\"Says Husband Too Absorbed In Business To Make Home Happy.\" For weeks\nafterward, wherever he went, he felt that blush upon his forehead. For\nthe first time in his life the coarse fingering of public curiosity had\ntouched the secret places of his soul, and nothing that had gone before\nseemed as humiliating as this trivial comment on his tragedy. The\nparagraph continued on its way through the press, and whenever he took\nup a newspaper he seemed to come upon it, slightly modified, variously\ndeveloped, but always reverting with a kind of unctuous irony to his\nfinancial preoccupations and his wife's consequent loneliness. The\nphrase was even taken up by the paragraph writer, called forth excited\nletters from similarly situated victims, was commented on in humorous\neditorials and served as a text for pulpit denunciations of the growing\ncraze for wealth; and finally, at his dentist's, Ralph came across it\nin a Family Weekly, as one of the \"Heart problems\" propounded to\nsubscribers, with a Gramophone, a Straight-front Corset and a Vanity-box\namong the prizes offered for its solution.\n\n\n\nXXIV\n\n\"If you'd only had the sense to come straight to me, Undine Spragg!\nThere isn't a tip I couldn't have given you--not one!\"\n\nThis speech, in which a faintly contemptuous compassion for her friend's\ncase was blent with the frankest pride in her own, probably represented\nthe nearest approach to \"tact\" that Mrs. James J. Rolliver had yet\nacquired. Undine was impartial enough to note in it a distinct advance\non the youthful methods of Indiana Frusk; yet it required a good deal\nof self-control to take the words to herself with a smile, while they\nseemed to be laying a visible scarlet welt across the pale face she kept\nvaliantly turned to her friend. The fact that she must permit herself to\nbe pitied by Indiana Frusk gave her the uttermost measure of the depth\nto which her fortunes had fallen. This abasement was inflicted on her\nin the staring gold apartment of the Hotel Nouveau Luxe in which the\nRollivers had established themselves on their recent arrival in Paris.\nThe vast drawing-room, adorned only by two high-shouldered gilt baskets\nof orchids drooping on their wires, reminded Undine of the \"Looey suite\"\nin which the opening scenes of her own history had been enacted; and\nthe resemblance and the difference were emphasized by the fact that the\nimage of her past self was not inaccurately repeated in the triumphant\npresence of Indiana Rolliver.\n\n\"There isn't a tip I couldn't have given you--not one!\" Mrs.\nRolliver reproachfully repeated; and all Undine's superiorities and\ndiscriminations seemed to shrivel up in the crude blaze of the other's\nsolid achievement.\n\nThere was little comfort in noting, for one's private delectation,\nthat Indiana spoke of her husband as \"Mr. Rolliver,\" that she twanged a\npiercing R, that one of her shoulders was still higher than the other,\nand that her striking dress was totally unsuited to the hour, the\nplace and the occasion. She still did and was all that Undine had so\nsedulously learned not to be and to do; but to dwell on these obstacles\nto her success was but to be more deeply impressed by the fact that she\nhad nevertheless succeeded.\n\nNot much more than a year had elapsed since Undine Marvell, sitting\nin the drawing-room of another Parisian hotel, had heard the immense\norchestral murmur of Paris rise through the open windows like the\nascending movement of her own hopes. The immense murmur still sounded\non, deafening and implacable as some elemental force; and the discord in\nher fate no more disturbed it than the motor wheels rolling by under\nthe windows were disturbed by the particles of dust that they ground to\nfiner powder as they passed.\n\n\"I could have told you one thing right off,\" Mrs. Rolliver went on with\nher ringing energy. \"And that is, to get your divorce first thing. A\ndivorce is always a good thing to have: you never can tell when you may\nwant it. You ought to have attended to that before you even BEGAN with\nPeter Van Degen.\"\n\nUndine listened, irresistibly impressed. \"Did YOU?\" she asked; but Mrs.\nRolliver, at this, grew suddenly veiled and sibylline. She wound her\nbig bejewelled hand through her pearls--there were ropes and ropes of\nthem--and leaned back, modestly sinking her lids.\n\n\"I'm here, anyhow,\" she rejoined, with \"CIRCUMSPICE!\" in look and tone.\n\nUndine, obedient to the challenge, continued to gaze at the pearls.\nThey were real; there was no doubt about that. And so was Indiana's\nmarriage--if she kept out of certain states.\n\n\"Don't you see,\" Mrs. Rolliver continued, \"that having to leave him when\nyou did, and rush off to Dakota for six months, was--was giving him too\nmuch time to think; and giving it at the wrong time, too?\" \"Oh, I see.\nBut what could I do? I'm not an immoral woman.\"\n\n\"Of course not, dearest. You were merely thoughtless that's what I meant\nby saying you ought to have had your divorce ready.\"\n\nA flicker of self-esteem caused Undine to protest. \"It wouldn't have\nmade any difference. His wife would never have given him up.\"\n\n\"She's so crazy about him?\"\n\n\"No: she hates him so. And she hates me too, because she's in love with\nmy husband.\"\n\nIndiana bounced out of her lounging attitude and struck her hands\ntogether with a rattle of rings.\n\n\"In love with your husband? What's the matter, then? Why on earth didn't\nthe four of you fix it up together?\"\n\n\"You don't understand.\" (It was an undoubted relief to be able, at\nlast, to say that to Indiana!) \"Clare Van Degen thinks divorce wrong--or\nrather awfully vulgar.\"\n\n\"VULGAR?\" Indiana flamed. \"If that isn't just too much! A woman who's in\nlove with another woman's husband? What does she think refined, I'd like\nto know? Having a lover, I suppose--like the women in these nasty French\nplays? I've told Mr. Rolliver I won't go to the theatre with him again\nin Paris--it's too utterly low. And the swell society's just as bad:\nit's simply rotten. Thank goodness I was brought up in a place where\nthere's some sense of decency left!\" She looked compassionately at\nUndine. \"It was New York that demoralized you--and I don't blame you for\nit. Out at Apex you'd have acted different. You never NEVER would have\ngiven way to your feelings before you'd got your divorce.\"\n\nA slow blush rose to Undine's forehead.\n\n\"He seemed so unhappy--\" she murmured.\n\n\"Oh, I KNOW!\" said Indiana in a tone of cold competence. She gave Undine\nan impatient glance. \"What was the understanding between you, when you\nleft Europe last August to go out to Dakota?\"\n\n\"Peter was to go to Reno in the autumn--so that it wouldn't look too\nmuch as if we were acting together. I was to come to Chicago to see him\non his way out there.\"\n\n\"And he never came?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"And he stopped writing?\"\n\n\"Oh, he never writes.\"\n\nIndiana heaved a deep sigh of intelligence. \"There's one perfectly clear\nrule: never let out of your sight a man who doesn't write.\"\n\n\"I know. That's why I stayed with him--those few weeks last summer....\"\n\nIndiana sat thinking, her fine shallow eyes fixed unblinkingly on her\nfriend's embarrassed face.\n\n\"I suppose there isn't anybody else--?\"\n\n\"Anybody--?\"\n\n\"Well--now you've got your divorce: anybody else it would come in handy\nfor?\"\n\nThis was harder to bear than anything that had gone before: Undine could\nnot have borne it if she had not had a purpose. \"Mr. Van Degen owes it\nto me--\" she began with an air of wounded dignity.\n\n\"Yes, yes: I know. But that's just talk. If there IS anybody else--\"\n\n\"I can't imagine what you think of me, Indiana!\"\n\nIndiana, without appearing to resent this challenge, again lost herself\nin meditation.\n\n\"Well, I'll tell him he's just GOT to see you,\" she finally emerged from\nit to say.\n\nUndine gave a quick upward look: this was what she had been waiting\nfor ever since she had read, a few days earlier, in the columns of her\nmorning journal, that Mr. Peter Van Degen and Mr. and Mrs. James J.\nRolliver had been fellow-passengers on board the Semantic. But she did\nnot betray her expectations by as much as the tremor of an eye-lash. She\nknew her friend well enough to pour out to her the expected tribute of\nsurprise.\n\n\"Why, do you mean to say you know him, Indiana?\"\n\n\"Mercy, yes! He's round here all the time. He crossed on the steamer\nwith us, and Mr. Rolliver's taken a fancy to him,\" Indiana explained, in\nthe tone of the absorbed bride to whom her husband's preferences are the\nsole criterion.\n\nUndine turned a tear-suffused gaze on her. \"Oh, Indiana, if I could only\nsee him again I know it would be all right! He's awfully, awfully fond\nof me; but his family have influenced him against me--\"\n\n\"I know what THAT is!\" Mrs. Rolliver interjected.\n\n\"But perhaps,\" Undine continued, \"it would be better if I could meet\nhim first without his knowing beforehand--without your telling him ... I\nlove him too much to reproach him!\" she added nobly.\n\nIndiana pondered: it was clear that, though the nobility of the\nsentiment impressed her, she was disinclined to renounce the idea of\ntaking a more active part in her friend's rehabilitation. But Undine\nwent on: \"Of course you've found out by this time that he's just a big\nspoiled baby. Afterward--when I've seen him--if you'd talk to him; or it\nyou'd only just let him BE with you, and see how perfectly happy you and\nMr. Rolliver are!\"\n\nIndiana seized on this at once. \"You mean that what he wants is the\ninfluence of a home like ours? Yes, yes, I understand. I tell you what\nI'll do: I'll just ask him round to dine, and let you know the day,\nwithout telling him beforehand that you're coming.\"\n\n\"Oh, Indiana!\" Undine held her in a close embrace, and then drew away\nto say: \"I'm so glad I found you. You must go round with me everywhere.\nThere are lots of people here I want you to know.\"\n\nMrs. Rolliver's expression changed from vague sympathy to concentrated\ninterest. \"I suppose it's awfully gay here? Do you go round a great deal\nwith the American set?\"\n\nUndine hesitated for a fraction of a moment. \"There are a few of them\nwho are rather jolly. But I particularly want you to meet my friend the\nMarquis Roviano--he's from Rome; and a lovely Austrian woman, Baroness\nAdelschein.\"\n\nHer friend's face was brushed by a shade of distrust. \"I don't know as I\ncare much about meeting foreigners,\" she said indifferently.\n\nUndine smiled: it was agreeable at last to be able to give Indiana a\n\"point\" as valuable as any of hers on divorce.\n\n\"Oh, some of them are awfully attractive; and THEY'LL make you meet the\nAmericans.\"\n\nIndiana caught this on the bound: one began to see why she had got on in\nspite of everything.\n\n\"Of course I'd love to know your friends,\" she said, kissing Undine; who\nanswered, giving back the kiss:\n\n\"You know there's nothing on earth I wouldn't do for you.\"\n\nIndiana drew back to look at her with a comic grimace under which a\nshade of anxiety was visible. \"Well, that's a pretty large order. But\nthere's just one thing you CAN do, dearest: please to let Mr. Rolliver\nalone!\"\n\n\"Mr. Rolliver, my dear?\" Undine's laugh showed that she took this for\nunmixed comedy. \"That's a nice way to remind me that you're heaps and\nheaps better-looking than I am!\"\n\nIndiana gave her an acute glance. \"Millard Binch didn't think so--not\neven at the very end.\"\n\n\"Oh, poor Millard!\" The women's smiles mingled easily over the common\nreminiscence, and once again, on the threshold. Undine enfolded her\nfriend. In the light of the autumn afternoon she paused a moment at\nthe door of the Nouveau Luxe, and looked aimlessly forth at the brave\nspectacle in which she seemed no longer to have a stake.\n\nMany of her old friends had already returned to Paris: the Harvey\nShallums, May Beringer, Dicky Bowles and other westward-bound nomads\nlingering on for a glimpse of the autumn theatres and fashions before\nhurrying back to inaugurate the New York season. A year ago Undine would\nhave had no difficulty in introducing Indiana Rolliver to this group--a\ngroup above which her own aspirations already beat an impatient wing.\nNow her place in it had become too precarious for her to force an\nentrance for her protectress. Her New York friends were at no pains to\nconceal from her that in their opinion her divorce had been a blunder.\nTheir logic was that of Apex reversed. Since she had not been \"sure\" of\nVan Degen, why in the world, they asked, had she thrown away a position\nshe WAS sure of? Mrs. Harvey Shallum, in particular, had not scrupled\nto put the question squarely. \"Chelles was awfully taken--he would have\nintroduced you everywhere. I thought you were wild to know smart French\npeople; I thought Harvey and I weren't good enough for you any longer.\nAnd now you've done your best to spoil everything! Of course I feel for\nyou tremendously--that's the reason why I'm talking so frankly. You must\nbe horribly depressed. Come and dine to-night--or no, if you don't mind\nI'd rather you chose another evening. I'd forgotten that I'd asked the\nJim Driscolls, and it might be uncomfortable--for YOU....\"\n\nIn another world she was still welcome, at first perhaps even more so\nthan before: the world, namely, to which she had proposed to present\nIndiana Rolliver. Roviano, Madame Adelschein, and a few of the freer\nspirits of her old St. Moritz band, reappearing in Paris with the close\nof the watering-place season, had quickly discovered her and shown a\nkeen interest in her liberation. It appeared in some mysterious way to\nmake her more available for their purpose, and she found that, in\nthe character of the last American divorcee, she was even regarded as\neligible to the small and intimate inner circle of their loosely-knit\nassociation. At first she could not make out what had entitled her to\nthis privilege, and increasing enlightenment produced a revolt of the\nApex puritanism which, despite some odd accommodations and compliances,\nstill carried its head so high in her.\n\nUndine had been perfectly sincere in telling Indiana Rolliver that she\nwas not \"an Immoral woman.\" The pleasures for which her sex took such\nrisks had never attracted her, and she did not even crave the excitement\nof having it thought that they did. She wanted, passionately and\npersistently, two things which she believed should subsist together in\nany well-ordered life: amusement and respectability; and despite her\nsurface-sophistication her notion of amusement was hardly less innocent\nthan when she had hung on the plumber's fence with Indiana Frusk. It\ngave her, therefore, no satisfaction to find herself included among\nMadame Adelschein's intimates. It embarrassed her to feel that she was\nexpected to be \"queer\" and \"different,\" to respond to pass-words and\ntalk in innuendo, to associate with the equivocal and the subterranean\nand affect to despise the ingenuous daylight joys which really satisfied\nher soul. But the business shrewdness which was never quite dormant in\nher suggested that this was not the moment for such scruples. She must\nmake the best of what she could get and wait her chance of getting\nsomething better; and meanwhile the most practical use to which she\ncould put her shady friends was to flash their authentic nobility in the\ndazzled eyes of Mrs. Rolliver.\n\nWith this object in view she made haste, in a fashionable tea-room of\nthe rue de Rivoli, to group about Indiana the most titled members of the\nband; and the felicity of the occasion would have been unmarred had she\nnot suddenly caught sight of Raymond de Chelles sitting on the other\nside of the room.\n\nShe had not seen Chelles since her return to Paris. It had seemed\npreferable to leave their meeting to chance and the present chance\nmight have served as well as another but for the fact that among his\ncompanions were two or three of the most eminent ladies of the\nproud quarter beyond the Seine. It was what Undine, in moments of\ndiscouragement, characterized as \"her luck\" that one of these should\nbe the hated Miss Wincher of Potash Springs, who had now become the\nMarquise de Trezac. Undine knew that Chelles and his compatriots,\nhowever scandalized at her European companions, would be completely\nindifferent to Mrs. Rolliver's appearance; but one gesture of Madame de\nTrezac's eye-glass would wave Indiana to her place and thus brand the\nwhole party as \"wrong.\"\n\nAll this passed through Undine's mind in the very moment of her\nnoting the change of expression with which Chelles had signalled\nhis recognition. If their encounter could have occurred in happier\nconditions it might have had far-reaching results. As it was, the\ncrowded state of the tea-room, and the distance between their tables,\nsufficiently excused his restricting his greeting to an eager bow; and\nUndine went home heavy-hearted from this first attempt to reconstruct\nher past.\n\nHer spirits were not lightened by the developments of the next few\ndays. She kept herself well in the foreground of Indiana's life,\nand cultivated toward the rarely-visible Rolliver a manner in which\nimpersonal admiration for the statesman was tempered with the politest\nindifference to the man. Indiana seemed to do justice to her efforts and\nto be reassured by the result; but still there came no hint of a\nreward. For a time Undine restrained the question on her lips; but one\nafternoon, when she had inducted Indiana into the deepest mysteries\nof Parisian complexion-making, the importance of the service and the\nconfidential mood it engendered seemed to warrant a discreet allusion to\ntheir bargain.\n\nIndiana leaned back among her cushions with an embarrassed laugh.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, I've been meaning to tell you--it's off, I'm afraid. The\ndinner is, I mean. You see, Mr. Van Degen has seen you 'round with me,\nand the very minute I asked him to come and dine he guessed--\"\n\n\"He guessed--and he wouldn't?\"\n\n\"Well, no. He wouldn't. I hate to tell you.\"\n\n\"Oh--\" Undine threw off a vague laugh. \"Since you're intimate enough for\nhim to tell you THAT he must, have told you more--told you something to\njustify his behaviour. He couldn't--even Peter Van Degen couldn't--just\nsimply have said to you: 'I wont see her.'\"\n\nMrs. Rolliver hesitated, visibly troubled to the point of regretting her\nintervention.\n\n\"He DID say more?\" Undine insisted. \"He gave you a reason?\n\n\"He said you'd know.\"\n\n\"Oh how base--how base!\" Undine was trembling with one of her\nlittle-girl rages, the storms of destructive fury before which Mr. and\nMrs. Spragg had cowered when she was a charming golden-curled cherub.\nBut life had administered some of the discipline which her parents had\nspared her, and she pulled herself together with a gasp of pain. \"Of\ncourse he's been turned against me. His wife has the whole of New York\nbehind her, and I've no one; but I know it would be all right if I could\nonly see him.\"\n\nHer friend made no answer, and Undine pursued, with an irrepressible\noutbreak of her old vehemence: \"Indiana Rolliver, if you won't do it for\nme I'll go straight off to his hotel this very minute. I'll wait there\nin the hall till he sees me!\"\n\nIndiana lifted a protesting hand. \"Don't, Undine--not that!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well--I wouldn't, that's all.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't? Why wouldn't you? You must have a reason.\" Undine faced\nher with levelled brows. \"Without a reason you can't have changed so\nutterly since our last talk. You were positive enough then that I had a\nright to make him see me.\"\n\nSomewhat to her surprise, Indiana made no effort to elude the challenge.\n\"Yes, I did think so then. But I know now that it wouldn't do you the\nleast bit of good.\"\n\n\"Have they turned him so completely against me? I don't care if they\nhave! I know him--I can get him back.\"\n\n\"That's the trouble.\" Indiana shed on her a gaze of cold compassion.\n\"It's not that any one has turned him against you. It's worse than\nthat--\"\n\n\"What can be?\"\n\n\"You'll hate me if I tell you.\"\n\n\"Then you'd better make him tell me himself!\"\n\n\"I can't. I tried to. The trouble is that it was YOU--something you did,\nI mean. Something he found out about you--\"\n\nUndine, to restrain a spring of anger, had to clutch both arms of her\nchair. \"About me? How fearfully false! Why, I've never even LOOKED at\nanybody--!\"\n\n\"It's nothing of that kind.\" Indiana's mournful head-shake seemed to\ndeplore, in Undine, an unsuspected moral obtuseness. \"It's the way you\nacted to your own husband.\"\n\n\"I--my--to Ralph? HE reproaches me for that? Peter Van Degen does?\"\n\"Well, for one particular thing. He says that the very day you went off\nwith him last year you got a cable from New York telling you to come\nback at once to Mr. Marvell, who was desperately ill.\"\n\n\"How on earth did he know?\" The cry escaped Undine before she could\nrepress it.\n\n\"It's true, then?\" Indiana exclaimed. \"Oh, Undine--\"\n\nUndine sat speechless and motionless, the anger frozen to terror on her\nlips.\n\nMrs. Rolliver turned on her the reproachful gaze of the deceived\nbenefactress. \"I didn't believe it when he told me; I'd never have\nthought it of you. Before you'd even applied for your divorce!\"\n\nUndine made no attempt to deny the charge or to defend herself. For\na moment she was lost in the pursuit of an unseizable clue--the\nexplanation of this monstrous last perversity of fate. Suddenly she rose\nto her feet with a set face.\n\n\"The Marvells must have told him--the beasts!\" It relieved her to be\nable to cry it out.\n\n\"It was your husband's sister--what did you say her name was? When you\ndidn't answer her cable, she cabled Mr. Van Degen to find out where you\nwere and tell you to come straight back.\"\n\nUndine stared. \"He never did!\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Doesn't that show you the story's all trumped up?\"\n\nIndiana shook her head. \"He said nothing to you about it because he was\nwith you when you received the first cable, and you told him it was from\nyour sister-in-law, just worrying you as usual to go home; and when he\nasked if there was anything else in it you said there wasn't another\nthing.\"\n\nUndine, intently following her, caught at this with a spring. \"Then he\nknew it all along--he admits that? And it made no earthly difference to\nhim at the time?\" She turned almost victoriously on her friend. \"Did he\nhappen to explain THAT, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Indiana's longanimity grew almost solemn. \"It came over him\ngradually, he said. One day when he wasn't feeling very well he thought\nto himself: 'Would she act like that to ME if I was dying?' And after\nthat he never felt the same to you.\" Indiana lowered her empurpled\nlids. \"Men have their feelings too--even when they're carried away by\npassion.\" After a pause she added: \"I don't know as I can blame him.\nUndine. You see, you were his ideal.\"\n\n\n\nXXV\n\nUndine Marvell, for the next few months, tasted all the accumulated\nbitterness of failure. After January the drifting hordes of her\ncompatriots had scattered to the four quarters of the globe, leaving\nParis to resume, under its low grey sky, its compacter winter\npersonality. Noting, from her more and more deserted corner, each least\nsign of the social revival, Undine felt herself as stranded and baffled\nas after the ineffectual summers of her girlhood. She was not without\npossible alternatives; but the sense of what she had lost took the\nsavour from all that was left. She might have attached herself to some\nmigratory group winged for Italy or Egypt; but the prospect of travel\ndid not in itself appeal to her, and she was doubtful of its social\nbenefit. She lacked the adventurous curiosity which seeks its occasion\nin the unknown; and though she could work doggedly for a given object\nthe obstacles to be overcome had to be as distinct as the prize. Her one\ndesire was to get back an equivalent of the precise value she had lost\nin ceasing to be Ralph Marvell's wife. Her new visiting-card, bearing\nher Christian name in place of her husband's, was like the coin of a\ndebased currency testifying to her diminished trading capacity. Her\nrestricted means, her vacant days, all the minor irritations of her\nlife, were as nothing compared to this sense of a lost advantage. Even\nin the narrowed field of a Parisian winter she might have made herself\na place in some more or less extra-social world; but her experiments in\nthis line gave her no pleasure proportioned to the possible derogation.\nShe feared to be associated with \"the wrong people,\" and scented a shade\nof disrespect in every amicable advance. The more pressing attentions of\none or two men she had formerly known filled her with a glow of outraged\npride, and for the first time in her life she felt that even solitude\nmight be preferable to certain kinds of society. Since ill health was\nthe most plausible pretext for seclusion, it was almost a relief to find\nthat she was really growing \"nervous\" and sleeping badly. The doctor she\nsummoned advised her trying a small quiet place on the Riviera, not too\nnear the sea; and thither in the early days of December, she transported\nherself with her maid and an omnibus-load of luggage.\n\nThe place disconcerted her by being really small and quiet, and for\na few days she struggled against the desire for flight. She had never\nbefore known a world as colourless and negative as that of the large\nwhite hotel where everybody went to bed at nine, and donkey-rides over\nstony hills were the only alternative to slow drives along dusty roads.\nMany of the dwellers in this temple of repose found even these exercises\ntoo stimulating, and preferred to sit for hours under the palms in\nthe garden, playing Patience, embroidering, or reading odd volumes\nof Tauchnitz. Undine, driven by despair to an inspection of the hotel\nbook-shelves, discovered that scarcely any work they contained was\ncomplete; but this did not seem to trouble the readers, who continued to\nfeed their leisure with mutilated fiction, from which they occasionally\nraised their eyes to glance mistrustfully at the new arrival sweeping\nthe garden gravel with her frivolous draperies. The inmates of the\nhotel were of different nationalities, but their racial differences were\nlevelled by the stamp of a common mediocrity. All differences of\ntongue, of custom, of physiognomy, disappeared in this deep community of\ninsignificance, which was like some secret bond, with the manifold signs\nand pass-words of its ignorances and its imperceptions. It was not the\nheterogeneous mediocrity of the American summer hotel where the lack of\nany standard is the nearest approach to a tie, but an organized codified\ndulness, in conscious possession of its rights, and strong in the\nvoluntary ignorance of any others.\n\nIt took Undine a long time to accustom herself to such an atmosphere,\nand meanwhile she fretted, fumed and flaunted, or abandoned herself to\nlong periods of fruitless brooding. Sometimes a flame of anger shot up\nin her, dismally illuminating the path she had travelled and the blank\nwall to which it led. At other moments past and present were enveloped\nin a dull fog of rancour which distorted and faded even the image she\npresented to her morning mirror. There were days when every young face\nshe saw left in her a taste of poison. But when she compared herself\nwith the specimens of her sex who plied their languid industries under\nthe palms, or looked away as she passed them in hall or staircase,\nher spirits rose, and she rang for her maid and dressed herself in her\nnewest and vividest. These were unprofitable triumphs, however. She\nnever made one of her attacks on the organized disapproval of the\ncommunity without feeling she had lost ground by it; and the next day\nshe would lie in bed and send down capricious orders for food, which her\nmaid would presently remove untouched, with instructions to transmit her\ncomplaints to the landlord.\n\nSometimes the events of the past year, ceaselessly revolving through\nher brain, became no longer a subject for criticism or justification but\nsimply a series of pictures monotonously unrolled. Hour by hour, in such\nmoods, she re-lived the incidents of her flight with Peter Van Degen:\nthe part of her career that, since it had proved a failure, seemed least\nlike herself and most difficult to justify. She had gone away with him,\nand had lived with him for two months: she, Undine Marvell, to whom\nrespectability was the breath of life, to whom such follies had always\nbeen unintelligible and therefore inexcusable.--She had done this\nincredible thing, and she had done it from a motive that seemed, at\nthe time, as clear, as logical, as free from the distorting mists of\nsentimentality, as any of her father's financial enterprises. It\nhad been a bold move, but it had been as carefully calculated as the\nhappiest Wall Street \"stroke.\" She had gone away with Peter because,\nafter the decisive scene in which she had put her power to the test, to\nyield to him seemed the surest means of victory. Even to her practical\nintelligence it was clear that an immediate dash to Dakota might look\ntoo calculated; and she had preserved her self-respect by telling\nherself that she was really his wife, and in no way to blame if the law\ndelayed to ratify the bond. She was still persuaded of the justness of\nher reasoning; but she now saw that it had left certain risks out of\naccount. Her life with Van Degen had taught her many things. The two\nhad wandered from place to place, spending a great deal of money, always\nmore and more money; for the first time in her life she had been able\nto buy everything she wanted. For a while this had kept her amused and\nbusy; but presently she began to perceive that her companion's view\nof their relation was not the same as hers. She saw that he had always\nmeant it to be an unavowed tie, screened by Mrs. Shallum's companionship\nand Clare's careless tolerance; and that on those terms he would have\nbeen ready to shed on their adventure the brightest blaze of notoriety.\nBut since Undine had insisted on being carried off like a sentimental\nschool-girl he meant to shroud the affair in mystery, and was as zealous\nin concealing their relation as she was bent on proclaiming it. In the\n\"powerful\" novels which Popple was fond of lending her she had met\nwith increasing frequency the type of heroine who scorns to love\nclandestinely, and proclaims the sanctity of passion and the moral\nduty of obeying its call. Undine had been struck by these arguments as\njustifying and even ennobling her course, and had let Peter understand\nthat she had been actuated by the highest motives in openly associating\nher life with his; but he had opposed a placid insensibility to these\nallusions, and had persisted in treating her as though their journey\nwere the kind of escapade that a man of the world is bound to hide. She\nhad expected him to take her to all the showy places where couples like\nthemselves are relieved from a too sustained contemplation of nature\nby the distractions of the restaurant and the gaming-table; but he\nhad carried her from one obscure corner of Europe to another, shunning\nfashionable hotels and crowded watering-places, and displaying an\ningenuity in the discovery of the unvisited and the out-of-season that\ngave their journey an odd resemblance to her melancholy wedding-tour.\n\nShe had never for a moment ceased to remember that the Dakota\ndivorce-court was the objective point of this later honeymoon, and her\nallusions to the fact were as frequent as prudence permitted. Peter\nseemed in no way disturbed by them. He responded with expressions of\nincreasing tenderness, or the purchase of another piece of jewelry;\nand though Undine could not remember his ever voluntarily bringing the\nsubject of their marriage he did not shrink from her recurring mention\nof it. He seemed merely too steeped in present well-being to think\nof the future, and she ascribed this to the fact that his faculty of\nenjoyment could not project itself beyond the moment. Her business\nwas to make each of their days so agreeable that when the last came he\nshould be conscious of a void to be bridged over as rapidly as possible\nand when she thought this point had been reached she packed her trunks\nand started for Dakota.\n\nThe next picture to follow was that of the dull months in the western\ndivorce-town, where, to escape loneliness and avoid comment, she had\ncast in her lot with Mabel Lipscomb, who had lately arrived there on the\nsame errand.\n\nUndine, at the outset, had been sorry for the friend whose new venture\nseemed likely to result so much less brilliantly than her own;\nbut compassion had been replaced by irritation as Mabel's unpruned\nvulgarities, her enormous encroaching satisfaction with herself and\nher surroundings, began to pervade every corner of their provisional\nhousehold. Undine, during the first months of her exile, had been\nsustained by the fullest confidence in her future. When she had parted\nfrom Van Degen she had felt sure he meant to marry her, and the fact\nthat Mrs. Lipscomb was fortified by no similar hope made her easier to\nbear with. Undine was almost ashamed that the unwooed Mabel should be\nthe witness of her own felicity, and planned to send her off on a trip\nto Denver when Peter should announce his arrival; but the weeks passed,\nand Peter did not come. Mabel, on the whole, behaved well in this\ncontingency. Undine, in her first exultation, had confided all her\nhopes and plans to her friend, but Mabel took no undue advantage of the\nconfidence. She was even tactful in her loud fond clumsy way, with a\ntact that insistently boomed and buzzed about its victim's head. But one\nday she mentioned that she had asked to dinner a gentleman from Little\nRock who had come to Dakota with the same object as themselves, and\nwhose acquaintance she had made through her lawyer.\n\nThe gentleman from Little Rock came to dine, and within a week Undine\nunderstood that Mabel's future was assured. If Van Degen had been at\nhand Undine would have smiled with him at poor Mabel's infatuation and\nher suitor's crudeness. But Van Degen was not there. He made no sign, he\nsent no excuse; he simply continued to absent himself; and it was Undine\nwho, in due course, had to make way for Mrs. Lipscomb's caller, and sit\nupstairs with a novel while the drawing-room below was given up to the\nenacting of an actual love-story.\n\nEven then, even to the end, Undine had to admit that Mabel had behaved\n\"beautifully.\" But it is comparatively easy to behave beautifully when\none is getting what one wants, and when some one else, who has not\nalways been altogether kind, is not. The net result of Mrs. Lipscomb's\nmagnanimity was that when, on the day of parting, she drew Undine to\nher bosom with the hand on which her new engagement-ring blazed, Undine\nhated her as she hated everything else connected with her vain exile in\nthe wilderness.\n\n\n\nXXVI\n\nThe next phase in the unrolling vision was the episode of her return\nto New York. She had gone to the Malibran, to her parents--for it was\na moment in her career when she clung passionately to the conformities,\nand when the fact of being able to say: \"I'm here with my father and\nmother\" was worth paying for even in the discomfort of that grim abode.\nNevertheless, it was another thorn in her pride that her parents could\nnot--for the meanest of material reasons--transfer themselves at her\ncoming to one of the big Fifth Avenue hotels. When she had suggested it\nMr. Spragg had briefly replied that, owing to the heavy expenses of her\ndivorce suit, he couldn't for the moment afford anything better; and\nthis announcement cast a deeper gloom over the future.\n\nIt was not an occasion for being \"nervous,\" however; she had learned too\nmany hard facts in the last few months to think of having recourse\nto her youthful methods. And something told her that if she made the\nattempt it would be useless. Her father and mother seemed much older,\nseemed tired and defeated, like herself.\n\nParents and daughter bore their common failure in a common silence,\nbroken only by Mrs. Spragg's occasional tentative allusions to her\ngrandson. But her anecdotes of Paul left a deeper silence behind them.\nUndine did not want to talk of her boy. She could forget him when,\nas she put it, things were \"going her way,\" but in moments of\ndiscouragement the thought of him was an added bitterness, subtly\ndifferent from her other bitter thoughts, and harder to quiet. It had\nnot occurred to her to try to gain possession of the child. She was\nvaguely aware that the courts had given her his custody; but she had\nnever seriously thought of asserting this claim. Her parents' diminished\nmeans and her own uncertain future made her regard the care of Paul as\nan additional burden, and she quieted her scruples by thinking of him\nas \"better off\" with Ralph's family, and of herself as rather touchingly\ndisinterested in putting his welfare before her own. Poor Mrs. Spragg\nwas pining for him, but Undine rejected her artless suggestion that Mrs.\nHeeny should be sent to \"bring him round.\" \"I wouldn't ask them a favour\nfor the world--they're just waiting for a chance to be hateful to me,\"\nshe scornfully declared; but it pained her that her boy, should be\nso near, yet inaccessible, and for the first time she was visited\nby unwonted questionings as to her share in the misfortunes that had\nbefallen her. She had voluntarily stepped out of her social frame, and\nthe only person on whom she could with any satisfaction have laid\nthe blame was the person to whom her mind now turned with a belated\ntenderness. It was thus, in fact, that she thought of Ralph. His pride,\nhis reserve, all the secret expressions of his devotion, the tones of\nhis voice, his quiet manner, even his disconcerting irony: these seemed,\nin contrast to what she had since known, the qualities essential to her\nhappiness. She could console herself only by regarding it as part of her\nsad lot that poverty and the relentless animosity of his family, should\nhave put an end to so perfect a union: she gradually began to look on\nherself and Ralph as the victims of dark machinations, and when she\nmentioned him she spoke forgivingly, and implied that \"everything might\nhave been different\" if \"people\" had not \"come between\" them. She had\narrived in New York in midseason, and the dread of seeing familiar\nfaces kept her shut up in her room at the Malibran, reading novels and\nbrooding over possibilities of escape. She tried to avoid the daily\npapers, but they formed the staple diet of her parents, and now and then\nshe could not help taking one up and turning to the \"Society Column.\"\nIts perusal produced the impression that the season must be the gayest\nNew York had ever known. The Harmon B. Driscolls, young Jim and his\nwife, the Thurber Van Degens, the Chauncey Ellings, and all the other\nFifth Avenue potentates, seemed to have their doors perpetually open\nto a stream of feasters among whom the familiar presences of Grace\nBeringer, Bertha Shallum, Dicky Bowles and Claud Walsingham Popple\ncame and went with the irritating sameness of the figures in a\nstage-procession.\n\nAmong them also Peter Van Degen presently appeared. He had been on a\ntour around the world, and Undine could not look at a newspaper without\nseeing some allusion to his progress. After his return she noticed that\nhis name was usually coupled with his wife's: he and Clare seemed to\nbe celebrating his home-coming in a series of festivities, and Undine\nguessed that he had reasons for wishing to keep before the world the\nevidences of his conjugal accord.\n\nMrs. Heeny's clippings supplied her with such items as her own reading\nmissed; and one day the masseuse appeared with a long article from the\nleading journal of Little Rock, describing the brilliant nuptials of\nMabel Lipscomb--now Mrs. Homer Branney--and her departure for \"the\nCoast\" in the bridegroom's private car. This put the last touch to\nUndine's irritation, and the next morning she got up earlier than usual,\nput on her most effective dress, went for a quick walk around the Park,\nand told her father when she came in that she wanted him to take her to\nthe opera that evening.\n\nMr. Spragg stared and frowned. \"You mean you want me to go round and\nhire a box for you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\" Undine coloured at the infelicitous allusion: besides, she\nknew now that the smart people who were \"musical\" went in stalls.\n\n\"I only want two good seats. I don't see why I should stay shut up. I\nwant you to go with me,\" she added.\n\nHer father received the latter part of the request without comment: he\nseemed to have gone beyond surprise. But he appeared that evening at\ndinner in a creased and loosely fitting dress-suit which he had probably\nnot put on since the last time he had dined with his son-in-law, and he\nand Undine drove off together, leaving Mrs. Spragg to gaze after them\nwith the pale stare of Hecuba.\n\nTheir stalls were in the middle of the house, and around them swept\nthe great curve of boxes at which Undine had so often looked up in the\nremote Stentorian days. Then all had been one indistinguishable glitter,\nnow the scene was full of familiar details: the house was thronged with\npeople she knew, and every box seemed to contain a parcel of her\npast. At first she had shrunk from recognition; but gradually, as she\nperceived that no one noticed her, that she was merely part of the\ninvisible crowd out of range of the exploring opera glasses, she felt a\ndefiant desire to make herself seen. When the performance was over her\nfather wanted to leave the house by the door at which they had entered,\nbut she guided him toward the stockholders' entrance, and pressed her\nway among the furred and jewelled ladies waiting for their motors. \"Oh,\nit's the wrong door--never mind, we'll walk to the corner and get a\ncab,\" she exclaimed, speaking loudly enough to be overheard. Two or\nthree heads turned, and she met Dicky Bowles's glance, and returned his\nlaughing bow. The woman talking to him looked around, coloured slightly,\nand made a barely perceptible motion of her head. Just beyond her, Mrs.\nChauncey Elling, plumed and purple, stared, parted her lips, and\nturned to say something important to young Jim Driscoll, who looked\nup involuntarily and then squared his shoulders and gazed fixedly at\na distant point, as people do at a funeral. Behind them Undine caught\nsight of Clare Van Degen; she stood alone, and her face was pale and\nlistless. \"Shall I go up and speak to her?\" Undine wondered. Some\nintuition told her that, alone of all the women present, Clare might\nhave greeted her kindly; but she hung back, and Mrs. Harmon Driscoll\nsurged by on Popple's arm. Popple crimsoned, coughed, and signalled\ndespotically to Mrs. Driscoll's footman. Over his shoulder Undine\nreceived a bow from Charles Bowen, and behind Bowen she saw two or three\nother men she knew, and read in their faces surprise, curiosity, and the\nwish to show their pleasure at seeing her. But she grasped her father's\narm and drew him out among the entangled motors and vociferating\npolicemen.\n\nNeither she nor Mr. Spragg spoke a word on the way home; but when they\nreached the Malibran her father followed her up to her room. She had\ndropped her cloak and stood before the wardrobe mirror studying her\nreflection when he came up behind her and she saw that he was looking at\nit too.\n\n\"Where did that necklace come from?\"\n\nUndine's neck grew pink under the shining circlet. It was the first time\nsince her return to New York that she had put on a low dress and thus\nuncovered the string of pearls she always wore. She made no answer, and\nMr. Spragg continued: \"Did your husband give them to you?\"\n\n\"RALPH!\" She could not restrain a laugh.\n\n\"Who did, then?\"\n\nUndine remained silent. She really had not thought about the pearls,\nexcept in so far as she consciously enjoyed the pleasure of possessing\nthem; and her father, habitually so unobservant, had seemed the last\nperson likely to raise the awkward question of their origin.\n\n\"Why--\" she began, without knowing what she meant to say.\n\n\"I guess you better send 'em back to the party they belong to,\" Mr.\nSpragg continued, in a voice she did not know.\n\n\"They belong to me!\" she flamed up. He looked at her as if she had grown\nsuddenly small and insignificant. \"You better send 'em back to Peter Van\nDegen the first thing to-morrow morning,\" he said as he went out of the\nroom. As far as Undine could remember, it was the first time in her life\nthat he had ever ordered her to do anything; and when the door closed on\nhim she had the distinct sense that the question had closed with it, and\nthat she would have to obey. She took the pearls off and threw them from\nher angrily. The humiliation her father had inflicted on her was merged\nwith the humiliation to which she had subjected herself in going to the\nopera, and she had never before hated her life as she hated it then.\n\nAll night she lay sleepless, wondering miserably what to do; and out\nof her hatred of her life, and her hatred of Peter Van Degen, there\ngradually grew a loathing of Van Degen's pearls. How could she have\nkept them; how have continued to wear them about her neck! Only\nher absorption in other cares could have kept her from feeling the\nhumiliation of carrying about with her the price of her shame. Her\nnovel-reading had filled her mind with the vocabulary of outraged\nvirtue, and with pathetic allusions to woman's frailty, and while she\npitied herself she thought her father heroic. She was proud to think\nthat she had such a man to defend her, and rejoiced that it was in her\npower to express her scorn of Van Degen by sending back his jewels.\n\nBut her righteous ardour gradually cooled, and she was left once more\nto face the dreary problem of the future. Her evening at the opera had\nshown her the impossibility of remaining in New York. She had neither\nthe skill nor the power to fight the forces of indifference leagued\nagainst her: she must get away at once, and try to make a fresh start.\nBut, as usual, the lack of money hampered her. Mr. Spragg could no\nlonger afford to make her the allowance she had intermittently received\nfrom him during the first years of her marriage, and since she was now\nwithout child or household she could hardly make it a grievance that he\nhad reduced her income. But what he allowed her, even with the addition\nof her alimony, was absurdly insufficient. Not that she looked far\nahead; she had always felt herself predestined to ease and luxury, and\nthe possibility of a future adapted to her present budget did not occur\nto her. But she desperately wanted enough money to carry her without\nanxiety through the coming year.\n\nWhen her breakfast tray was brought in she sent it away untouched and\ncontinued to lie in her darkened room. She knew that when she got up she\nmust send back the pearls; but there was no longer any satisfaction\nin the thought, and she lay listlessly wondering how she could best\ntransmit them to Van Degen.\n\nAs she lay there she heard Mrs. Heeny's voice in the passage. Hitherto\nshe had avoided the masseuse, as she did every one else associated with\nher past. Mrs. Heeny had behaved with extreme discretion, refraining\nfrom all direct allusions to Undine's misadventure; but her silence\nwas obviously the criticism of a superior mind. Once again Undine had\ndisregarded her injunction to \"go slow,\" with results that justified the\nwarning. Mrs. Heeny's very reserve, however, now marked her as a safe\nadviser; and Undine sprang up and called her in. \"My sakes. Undine! You\nlook's if you'd been setting up all night with a remains!\" the masseuse\nexclaimed in her round rich tones.\n\nUndine, without answering, caught up the pearls and thrust them into\nMrs. Heeny's hands.\n\n\"Good land alive!\" The masseuse dropped into a chair and let the twist\nslip through her fat flexible fingers. \"Well, you got a fortune right\nround your neck whenever you wear them, Undine Spragg.\"\n\nUndine murmured something indistinguishable. \"I want you to take them--\"\nshe began.\n\n\"Take 'em? Where to?\"\n\n\"Why, to--\" She was checked by the wondering simplicity of Mrs. Heeny's\nstare. The masseuse must know where the pearls had come from, yet it had\nevidently not occurred to her that Mrs. Marvell was about to ask her to\nreturn them to their donor. In the light of Mrs. Heeny's unclouded gaze\nthe whole episode took on a different aspect, and Undine began to be\nvaguely astonished at her immediate submission to her father's will. The\npearls were hers, after all!\n\n\"To be re-strung?\" Mrs. Heeny placidly suggested. \"Why, you'd oughter\nto have it done right here before your eyes, with pearls that are worth\nwhat these are.\"\n\nAs Undine listened, a new thought shaped itself. She could not continue\nto wear the pearls: the idea had become intolerable. But for the first\ntime she saw what they might be converted into, and what they might\nrescue her from; and suddenly she brought out: \"Do you suppose I could\nget anything for them?\"\n\n\"Get anything? Why, what--\"\n\n\"Anything like what they're worth, I mean. They cost a lot of money:\nthey came from the biggest place in Paris.\" Under Mrs. Heeny's\nsimplifying eye it was comparatively easy to make these explanations. \"I\nwant you to try and sell them for me--I want you to do the best you can\nwith them. I can't do it myself--but you must swear you'll never tell a\nsoul,\" she pressed on breathlessly.\n\n\"Why, you poor child--it ain't the first time,\" said Mrs. Heeny, coiling\nthe pearls in her big palm. \"It's a pity too: they're such beauties. But\nyou'll get others,\" she added, as the necklace vanished into her bag.\n\nA few days later there appeared from the same receptacle a bundle of\nbanknotes considerable enough to quiet Undine's last scruples. She no\nlonger understood why she had hesitated. Why should she have thought it\nnecessary to give back the pearls to Van Degen? His obligation to her\nrepresented far more than the relatively small sum she had been able to\nrealize on the necklace. She hid the money in her dress, and when Mrs.\nHeeny had gone on to Mrs. Spragg's room she drew the packet out, and\ncounting the bills over, murmured to herself: \"Now I can get away!\"\n\nHer one thought was to return to Europe; but she did not want to go\nalone. The vision of her solitary figure adrift in the spring mob of\ntrans-Atlantic pleasure-seekers depressed and mortified her. She would\nbe sure to run across acquaintances, and they would infer that she was\nin quest of a new opportunity, a fresh start, and would suspect her of\ntrying to use them for the purpose. The thought was repugnant to her\nnewly awakened pride, and she decided that if she went to Europe her\nfather and mother must go with her. The project was a bold one, and when\nshe broached it she had to run the whole gamut of Mr. Spragg's irony. He\nwanted to know what she expected to do with him when she got him there;\nwhether she meant to introduce him to \"all those old Kings,\" how\nshe thought he and her mother would look in court dress, and how she\nsupposed he was going to get on without his New York paper. But Undine\nhad been aware of having what he himself would have called \"a pull\" over\nher father since, the day after their visit to the opera, he had taken\nher aside to ask: \"You sent back those pearls?\" and she had answered\ncoldly: \"Mrs. Heeny's taken them.\"\n\nAfter a moment of half-bewildered resistance her parents, perhaps\nsecretly flattered by this first expression of her need for them, had\nyielded to her entreaty, packed their trunks, and stoically set out for\nthe unknown. Neither Mr. Spragg nor his wife had ever before been out of\ntheir country; and Undine had not understood, till they stood beside\nher tongue-tied and helpless on the dock at Cherbourg, the task she\nhad undertaken in uprooting them. Mr. Spragg had never been physically\nactive, but on foreign shores he was seized by a strange restlessness,\nand a helpless dependence on his daughter. Mrs. Spragg's long habit of\napathy was overcome by her dread of being left alone when her husband\nand Undine went out, and she delayed and impeded their expeditions\nby insisting on accompanying them; so that, much as Undine disliked\nsightseeing, there seemed no alternative between \"going round\" with her\nparents and shutting herself up with them in the crowded hotels to which\nshe successively transported them.\n\nThe hotels were the only European institutions that really interested\nMr. Spragg. He considered them manifestly inferior to those at home;\nbut he was haunted by a statistical curiosity as to their size, their\nnumber, their cost and their capacity for housing and feeding the\nincalculable hordes of his countrymen. He went through galleries,\nchurches and museums in a stolid silence like his daughter's; but in the\nhotels he never ceased to enquire and investigate, questioning every one\nwho could speak English, comparing bills, collecting prospectuses\nand computing the cost of construction and the probable return on the\ninvestment. He regarded the non-existence of the cold-storage system as\none more proof of European inferiority, and no longer wondered, in\nthe absence of the room-to-room telephone, that foreigners hadn't yet\nmastered the first principles of time-saving.\n\nAfter a few weeks it became evident to both parents and daughter\nthat their unnatural association could not continue much longer. Mrs.\nSpragg's shrinking from everything new and unfamiliar had developed into\na kind of settled terror, and Mr. Spragg had begun to be depressed\nby the incredible number of the hotels and their simply incalculable\nhousing capacity.\n\n\"It ain't that they're any great shakes in themselves, any one of 'em;\nbut there's such a darned lot of 'em: they're as thick as mosquitoes,\nevery place you go.\" And he began to reckon up, on slips of paper, on\nthe backs of bills and the margins of old newspapers, the number of\ntravellers who could be simultaneously lodged, bathed and boarded on\nthe continent of Europe. \"Five hundred bedrooms--three hundred\nbathrooms--no; three hundred and fifty bathrooms, that one has: that\nmakes, supposing two-thirds of 'em double up--do you s'pose as many as\nthat do, Undie? That porter at Lucerne told me the Germans slept three\nin a room--well, call it eight hundred people; and three meals a day per\nhead; no, four meals, with that afternoon tea they take; and the last\nplace we were at--'way up on that mountain there--why, there were\nseventy-five hotels in that one spot alone, and all jam full--well, it\nbeats me to know where all the people come from...\"\n\nHe had gone on in this fashion for what seemed to his daughter an\nendless length of days; and then suddenly he had roused himself to say:\n\"See here, Undie, I got to go back and make the money to pay for all\nthis.\"\n\nThere had been no question on the part of any of the three of Undine's\nreturning with them; and after she had conveyed them to their steamer,\nand seen their vaguely relieved faces merged in the handkerchief-waving\nthrong along the taffrail, she had returned alone to Paris and made her\nunsuccessful attempt to enlist the aid of Indiana Rolliver.\n\n\n\nXXVII\n\nShe was still brooding over this last failure when one afternoon, as she\nloitered on the hotel terrace, she was approached by a young woman whom\nshe had seen sitting near the wheeled chair of an old lady wearing\na crumpled black bonnet under a funny fringed parasol with a jointed\nhandle.\n\nThe young woman, who was small, slight and brown, was dressed with a\ndisregard of the fashion which contrasted oddly with the mauve powder\non her face and the traces of artificial colour in her dark untidy hair.\nShe looked as if she might have several different personalities, and as\nif the one of the moment had been hanging up a long time in her wardrobe\nand been hurriedly taken down as probably good enough for the present\noccasion.\n\nWith her hands in her jacket pockets, and an agreeable smile on her\nboyish face, she strolled up to Undine and asked, in a pretty variety of\nParisian English, if she had the pleasure of speaking to Mrs. Marvell.\n\nOn Undine's assenting, the smile grew more alert and the lady continued:\n\"I think you know my friend Sacha Adelschein?\"\n\nNo question could have been less welcome to Undine. If there was one\npoint on which she was doggedly and puritanically resolved, it was that\nno extremes of social adversity should ever again draw her into the\ngroup of people among whom Madame Adelschein too conspicuously figured.\nSince her unsuccessful attempt to win over Indiana by introducing her\nto that group, Undine had been righteously resolved to remain aloof from\nit; and she was drawing herself up to her loftiest height of disapproval\nwhen the stranger, as if unconscious of it, went on: \"Sacha speaks of\nyou so often--she admires you so much.--I think you know also my cousin\nChelles,\" she added, looking into Undine's eyes. \"I am the Princess\nEstradina. I've come here with my mother for the air.\"\n\nThe murmur of negation died on Undine's lips. She found herself\ngrappling with a new social riddle, and such surprises were always\nstimulating. The name of the untidy-looking young woman she had been\nabout to repel was one of the most eminent in the impregnable quarter\nbeyond the Seine. No one figured more largely in the Parisian chronicle\nthan the Princess Estradina, and no name more impressively headed the\nlist at every marriage, funeral and philanthropic entertainment of\nthe Faubourg Saint Germain than that of her mother, the Duchesse\nde Dordogne, who must be no other than the old woman sitting in the\nBath-chair with the crumpled bonnet and the ridiculous sunshade.\n\nBut it was not the appearance of the two ladies that surprised Undine.\nShe knew that social gold does not always glitter, and that the lady she\nhad heard spoken of as Lili Estradina was notoriously careless of the\nconventions; but that she should boast of her intimacy with Madame\nAdelschein, and use it as a pretext for naming herself, overthrew all\nUndine's hierarchies.\n\n\"Yes--it's hideously dull here, and I'm dying of it. Do come over\nand speak to my mother. She's dying of it too; but don't tell her so,\nbecause she hasn't found it out. There were so many things our mothers\nnever found out,\" the Princess rambled on, with her half-mocking\nhalf-intimate smile; and in another moment Undine, thrilled at having\nMrs. Spragg thus coupled with a Duchess, found herself seated between\nmother and daughter, and responding by a radiant blush to the elder\nlady's amiable opening: \"You know my nephew Raymond--he's your great\nadmirer.\"\n\nHow had it happened, whither would it lead, how long could it last? The\nquestions raced through Undine's brain as she sat listening to her\nnew friends--they seemed already too friendly to be called\nacquaintances!--replying to their enquiries, and trying to think far\nenough ahead to guess what they would expect her to say, and what tone\nit would be well to take. She was used to such feats of mental agility,\nand it was instinctive with her to become, for the moment, the person\nshe thought her interlocutors expected her to be; but she had never\nhad quite so new a part to play at such short notice. She took her cue,\nhowever, from the fact that the Princess Estradina, in her mother's\npresence, made no farther allusion to her dear friend Sacha, and seemed\nsomehow, though she continued to chat on in the same easy strain, to\nlook differently and throw out different implications. All these shades\nof demeanour were immediately perceptible to Undine, who tried to adapt\nherself to them by combining in her manner a mixture of Apex dash and\nNew York dignity; and the result was so successful that when she rose to\ngo the Princess, with a hand on her arm, said almost wistfully: \"You're\nstaying on too? Then do take pity on us! We might go on some trips\ntogether; and in the evenings we could make a bridge.\"\n\nA new life began for Undine. The Princess, chained her mother's side,\nand frankly restive under her filial duty, clung to her new acquaintance\nwith a persistence too flattering to be analyzed. \"My dear, I was on\nthe brink of suicide when I saw your name in the visitors' list,\" she\nexplained; and Undine felt like answering that she had nearly reached\nthe same pass when the Princess's thin little hand had been held out\nto her. For the moment she was dizzy with the effect of that random\ngesture. Here she was, at the lowest ebb of her fortunes, miraculously\nrehabilitated, reinstated, and restored to the old victorious sense of\nher youth and her power! Her sole graces, her unaided personality, had\nworked the miracle; how should she not trust in them hereafter?\n\nAside from her feeling of concrete attainment. Undine was deeply\ninterested in her new friends. The Princess and her mother, in their\ndifferent ways, were different from any one else she had known. The\nPrincess, who might have been of any age between twenty and forty, had\na small triangular face with caressing impudent eyes, a smile like a\nsilent whistle and the gait of a baker's boy balancing his basket. She\nwore either baggy shabby clothes like a man's, or rich draperies that\nlooked as if they had been rained on; and she seemed equally at ease\nin either style of dress, and carelessly unconscious of both. She was\nextremely familiar and unblushingly inquisitive, but she never gave\nUndine the time to ask her any questions or the opportunity to venture\non any freedom with her. Nevertheless she did not scruple to talk of her\nsentimental experiences, and seemed surprised, and rather disappointed,\nthat Undine had so few to relate in return. She playfully accused her\nbeautiful new friend of being cachottiere, and at the sight of Undine's\nblush cried out: \"Ah, you funny Americans! Why do you all behave as if\nlove were a secret infirmity?\"\n\nThe old Duchess was even more impressive, because she fitted better into\nUndine's preconceived picture of the Faubourg Saint Germain, and was\nmore like the people with whom she pictured the former Nettie Wincher as\nliving in privileged intimacy. The Duchess was, indeed, more amiable\nand accessible than Undine's conception of a Duchess, and displayed a\ncuriosity as great as her daughter's, and much more puerile, concerning\nher new friend's history and habits. But through her mild prattle, and\nin spite of her limited perceptions. Undine felt in her the same clear\nimpenetrable barrier that she ran against occasionally in the Princess;\nand she was beginning to understand that this barrier represented a\nnumber of things about which she herself had yet to learn. She would\nnot have known this a few years earlier, nor would she have seen in the\nDuchess anything but the ruin of an ugly woman, dressed in clothes that\nMrs. Spragg wouldn't have touched. The Duchess certainly looked like a\nruin; but Undine now saw that she looked like the ruin of a castle.\n\nThe Princess, who was unofficially separated from her husband, had with\nher her two little girls. She seemed extremely attached to both--though\navowing for the younger a preference she frankly ascribed to the\ninteresting accident of its parentage--and she could not understand that\nUndine, as to whose domestic difficulties she minutely informed herself,\nshould have consented to leave her child to strangers. \"For, to\none's child every one but one's self is a stranger; and whatever\nyour egarements--\" she began, breaking off with a stare when Undine\ninterrupted her to explain that the courts had ascribed all the\nwrongs in the case to her husband. \"But then--but then--\" murmured the\nPrincess, turning away from the subject as if checked by too deep an\nabyss of difference.\n\nThe incident had embarrassed Undine, and though she tried to justify\nherself by allusions to her boy's dependence on his father's family,\nand to the duty of not standing in his way, she saw that she made no\nimpression. \"Whatever one's errors, one's child belongs to one,\" her\nhearer continued to repeat; and Undine, who was frequently scandalized\nby the Princess's conversation, now found herself in the odd position\nof having to set a watch upon her own in order not to scandalize the\nPrincess.\n\nEach day, nevertheless, strengthened her hold on her new friends. After\nher first flush of triumph she began indeed to suspect that she had been\na slight disappointment to the Princess, had not completely justified\nthe hopes raised by the doubtful honour of being one of Sacha\nAdelschein's intimates. Undine guessed that the Princess had expected to\nfind her more amusing, \"queerer,\" more startling in speech and conduct.\nThough by instinct she was none of these things, she was eager to go as\nfar as was expected; but she felt that her audacities were on lines\ntoo normal to be interesting, and that the Princess thought her rather\nschool-girlish and old-fashioned. Still, they had in common their youth,\ntheir boredom, their high spirits and their hunger for amusement; and\nUndine was making the most of these ties when one day, coming back from\na trip to Monte-Carlo with the Princess, she was brought up short by the\nsight of a lady--evidently a new arrival--who was seated in an attitude\nof respectful intimacy beside the old Duchess's chair. Undine, advancing\nunheard over the fine gravel of the garden path, recognized at a glance\nthe Marquise de Trezac's drooping nose and disdainful back, and at the\nsame moment heard her say: \"--And her husband?\"\n\n\"Her husband? But she's an American--she's divorced,\" the Duchess\nreplied, as if she were merely stating the same fact in two different\nways; and Undine stopped short with a pang of apprehension.\n\nThe Princess came up behind her. \"Who's the solemn person with Mamma?\nAh, that old bore of a Trezac!\" She dropped her long eye-glass with a\nlaugh. \"Well, she'll be useful--she'll stick to Mamma like a leech and\nwe shall get away oftener. Come, let's go and be charming to her.\"\n\nShe approached Madame de Trezac effusively, and after an interchange of\nexclamations Undine heard her say \"You know my friend Mrs. Marvell? No?\nHow odd! Where do you manage to hide yourself, chere Madame? Undine,\nhere's a compatriot who hasn't the pleasure--\"\n\n\"I'm such a hermit, dear Mrs. Marvell--the Princess shows me what I\nmiss,\" the Marquise de Trezac murmured, rising to give her hand\nto Undine, and speaking in a voice so different from that of the\nsupercilious Miss Wincher that only her facial angle and the droop of\nher nose linked her to the hated vision of Potash Springs.\n\nUndine felt herself dancing on a flood-tide of security. For the first\ntime the memory of Potash Springs became a thing to smile at, and with\nthe Princess's arm through hers she shone back triumphantly on Madame de\nTrezac, who seemed to have grown suddenly obsequious and insignificant,\nas though the waving of the Princess's wand had stripped her of all her\nfalse advantages.\n\nBut upstairs, in her own room. Undine's courage fell. Madame de Trezac\nhad been civil, effusive even, because for the moment she had been taken\noff her guard by finding Mrs. Marvell on terms of intimacy with the\nPrincess Estradina and her mother. But the force of facts would reassert\nitself. Far from continuing to see Undine through her French friends'\neyes she would probably invite them to view her compatriot through the\nsearching lens of her own ampler information. \"The old hypocrite--she'll\ntell them everything,\" Undine murmured, wincing at the recollection\nof the dentist's assistant from Deposit, and staring miserably at her\nreflection in the dressing-table mirror. Of what use were youth and\ngrace and good looks, if one drop of poison distilled from the envy of\na narrow-minded woman was enough to paralyze them? Of course Madame de\nTrezac knew and remembered, and, secure in her own impregnable position,\nwould never rest till she had driven out the intruder.\n\n\n\nXXVIII\n\n\"What do you say to Nice to-morrow, dearest?\" the Princess suggested\na few evenings later as she followed Undine upstairs after a languid\nevening at bridge with the Duchess and Madame de Trezac.\n\nHalf-way down the passage she stopped to open a door and, putting her\nfinger to her lip, signed to Undine to enter. In the taper-lit dimness\nstood two small white beds, each surmounted by a crucifix and a palm\nbranch, and each containing a small brown sleeping child with a mop of\nhair and a curiously finished little face. As the Princess stood gazing\non their innocent slumbers she seemed for a moment like a third little\ngirl scarcely bigger and browner than the others; and the smile with\nwhich she watched them was as clear as theirs. \"Ah, si seulement je\npouvais choisir leurs amants!\" she sighed as she turned away.\n\n\"--Nice to-morrow,\" she repeated, as she and Undine walked on to their\nrooms with linked arms. \"We may as well make hay while the Trezac\nshines. She bores Mamma frightfully, but Mamma won't admit it because\nthey belong to the same oeuvres. Shall it be the eleven train, dear?\nWe can lunch at the Royal and look in the shops--we may meet somebody\namusing. Anyhow, it's better than staying here!\"\n\nUndine was sure the trip to Nice would be delightful. Their previous\nexpeditions had shown her the Princess's faculty for organizing such\nadventures. At Monte-Carlo, a few days before, they had run across two\nor three amusing but unassorted people, and the Princess, having fused\nthem in a jolly lunch, had followed it up by a bout at baccarat,\nand, finally hunting down an eminent composer who had just arrived to\nrehearse a new production, had insisted on his asking the party to tea,\nand treating them to fragments of his opera.\n\nA few days earlier, Undine's hope of renewing such pleasures would have\nbeen clouded by the dread of leaving Madame de Trezac alone with the\nDuchess. But she had no longer any fear of Madame de Trezac. She had\ndiscovered that her old rival of Potash Springs was in actual dread\nof her disfavour, and nervously anxious to conciliate her, and the\ndiscovery gave her such a sense of the heights she had scaled, and the\nsecurity of her footing, that all her troubled past began to seem like\nthe result of some providential \"design,\" and vague impulses of piety\nstirred in her as she and the Princess whirled toward Nice through the\nblue and gold glitter of the morning.\n\nThey wandered about the lively streets, they gazed into the beguiling\nshops, the Princess tried on hats and Undine bought them, and they\nlunched at the Royal on all sorts of succulent dishes prepared under\nthe head-waiter's special supervision. But as they were savouring\ntheir \"double\" coffee and liqueurs, and Undine was wondering what her\ncompanion would devise for the afternoon, the Princess clapped her hands\ntogether and cried out: \"Dearest, I'd forgotten! I must desert you.\"\n\nShe explained that she'd promised the Duchess to look up a friend who\nwas ill--a poor wretch who'd been sent to Cimiez for her lungs--and that\nshe must rush off at once, and would be back as soon as possible--well,\nif not in an hour, then in two at latest. She was full of compunction,\nbut she knew Undine would forgive her, and find something amusing to\nfill up the time: she advised her to go back and buy the black hat with\nthe osprey, and try on the crepe de Chine they'd thought so smart: for\nany one as good-looking as herself the woman would probably alter it for\nnothing; and they could meet again at the Palace Tea-Rooms at four. She\nwhirled away in a cloud of explanations, and Undine, left alone, sat\ndown on the Promenade des Anglais. She did not believe a word the\nPrincess had said. She had seen in a flash why she was being left, and\nwhy the plan had not been divulged to her before-hand; and she\nquivered with resentment and humiliation. \"That's what she's wanted me\nfor...that's why she made up to me. She's trying it to-day, and after\nthis it'll happen regularly...she'll drag me over here every day or\ntwo...at least she thinks she will!\"\n\nA sincere disgust was Undine's uppermost sensation. She was as much\nashamed as Mrs. Spragg might have been at finding herself used to screen\na clandestine adventure.\n\n\"I'll let her see... I'll make her understand,\" she repeated angrily;\nand for a moment she was half-disposed to drive to the station and take\nthe first train back. But the sense of her precarious situation withheld\nher; and presently, with bitterness in her heart, she got up and began\nto stroll toward the shops.\n\nTo show that she was not a dupe, she arrived at the designated\nmeeting-place nearly an hour later than the time appointed; but when\nshe entered the Tea-Rooms the Princess was nowhere to be seen. The rooms\nwere crowded, and Undine was guided toward a small inner apartment\nwhere isolated couples were absorbing refreshments in an atmosphere of\nintimacy that made it seem incongruous to be alone. She glanced about\nfor a face she knew, but none was visible, and she was just giving up\nthe search when she beheld Elmer Moffatt shouldering his way through the\ncrowd.\n\nThe sight was so surprising that she sat gazing with unconscious fixity\nat the round black head and glossy reddish face which kept appearing and\ndisappearing through the intervening jungle of aigrettes. It was long\nsince she had either heard of Moffatt or thought about him, and now, in\nher loneliness and exasperation, she took comfort in the sight of his\nconfident capable face, and felt a longing to hear his voice and unbosom\nher woes to him. She had half risen to attract his attention when she\nsaw him turn back and make way for a companion, who was cautiously\nsteering her huge feathered hat between the tea-tables. The woman was\nof the vulgarest type; everything about her was cheap and gaudy. But\nMoffatt was obviously elated: he stood aside with a flourish to usher\nher in, and as he followed he shot out a pink shirt-cuff with\njewelled links, and gave his moustache a gallant twist. Undine felt an\nunreasoning irritation: she was vexed with him both for not being alone\nand for being so vulgarly accompanied. As the couple seated themselves\nshe caught Moffatt's glance and saw him redden to the edge of his white\nforehead; but he elaborately avoided her eye--he evidently wanted her to\nsee him do it--and proceeded to minister to his companion's wants with\nan air of experienced gallantry.\n\nThe incident, trifling as it was, filled up the measure of Undine's\nbitterness. She thought Moffatt pitiably ridiculous, and she hated him\nfor showing himself in such a light at that particular moment. Her mind\nturned back to her own grievance, and she was just saying to herself\nthat nothing on earth should prevent her letting the Princess know what\nshe thought of her, when the lady in question at last appeared. She came\nhurriedly forward and behind her Undine perceived the figure of a slight\nquietly dressed man, as to whom her immediate impression was that he\nmade every one else in the room look as common as Moffatt. An instant\nlater the colour had flown to her face and her hand was in Raymond de\nChelles, while the Princess, murmuring: \"Cimiez's such a long way off;\nbut you WILL forgive me?\" looked into her eyes with a smile that added:\n\"See how I pay for what I get!\"\n\nHer first glance showed Undine how glad Raymond de Chelles was to see\nher. Since their last meeting his admiration for her seemed not only to\nhave increased but to have acquired a different character. Undine, at\nan earlier stage in her career, might not have known exactly what the\ndifference signified; but it was as clear to her now as if the Princess\nhad said--what her beaming eyes seemed, in fact, to convey--\"I'm only\ntoo glad to do my cousin the same kind of turn you're doing me.\"\n\nBut Undine's increased experience, if it had made her more vigilant,\nhad also given her a clearer measure of her power. She saw at once\nthat Chelles, in seeking to meet her again, was not in quest of a mere\npassing adventure. He was evidently deeply drawn to her, and her present\nsituation, if it made it natural to regard her as more accessible, had\nnot altered the nature of his feeling. She saw and weighed all this in\nthe first five minutes during which, over tea and muffins, the Princess\ndescanted on her luck in happening to run across her cousin, and\nChelles, his enchanted eyes on Undine, expressed his sense of his good\nfortune. He was staying, it appeared, with friends at Beaulieu, and had\nrun over to Nice that afternoon by the merest chance: he added that,\nhaving just learned of his aunt's presence in the neighbourhood, he had\nalready planned to present his homage to her.\n\n\"Oh, don't come to us--we're too dull!\" the Princess exclaimed. \"Let us\nrun over occasionally and call on you: we're dying for a pretext, aren't\nwe?\" she added, smiling at Undine.\n\nThe latter smiled back vaguely, and looked across the room. Moffatt,\nlooking flushed and foolish, was just pushing back his chair. To carry\noff his embarrassment he put an additional touch of importance; and as\nhe swaggered out behind his companion, Undine said to herself, with a\nshiver: \"If he'd been alone they would have found me taking tea with\nhim.\"\n\nUndine, during the ensuing weeks, returned several times to Nice with\nthe Princess; but, to the latter's surprise, she absolutely refused\nto have Raymond de Chelles included in their luncheon-parties, or even\napprised in advance of their expeditions.\n\nThe Princess, always impatient of unnecessary dissimulation, had not\nattempted to keep up the feint of the interesting invalid at Cimiez. She\nconfessed to Undine that she was drawn to Nice by the presence there of\nthe person without whom, for the moment, she found life intolerable,\nand whom she could not well receive under the same roof with her little\ngirls and her mother. She appealed to Undine's sisterly heart to feel\nfor her in her difficulty, and implied that--as her conduct had already\nproved--she would always be ready to render her friend a like service.\nIt was at this point that Undine checked her by a decided word. \"I\nunderstand your position, and I'm very sorry for you, of course,\" she\nbegan (the Princess stared at the \"sorry\"). \"Your secret's perfectly\nsafe with me, and I'll do anything I can for you...but if I go to Nice\nwith you again you must promise not to ask your cousin to meet us.\"\n\nThe Princess's face expressed the most genuine astonishment. \"Oh, my\ndear, do forgive me if I've been stupid! He admires you so tremendously;\nand I thought--\"\n\n\"You'll do as I ask, please--won't you?\" Undine went on, ignoring the\ninterruption and looking straight at her under level brows; and the\nPrincess, with a shrug, merely murmured: \"What a pity! I fancied you\nliked him.\"\n\n\n\nXXIX\n\nThe early spring found Undine once more in Paris.\n\nShe had every reason to be satisfied with the result of the course she\nhad pursued since she had pronounced her ultimatum on the subject of\nRaymond de Chelles. She had continued to remain on the best of terms\nwith the Princess, to rise in the estimation of the old Duchess, and\nto measure the rapidity of her ascent in the upward gaze of Madame de\nTrezac; and she had given Chelles to understand that, if he wished to\nrenew their acquaintance, he must do so in the shelter of his venerable\naunt's protection.\n\nTo the Princess she was careful to make her attitude equally clear. \"I\nlike your cousin very much--he's delightful, and if I'm in Paris this\nspring I hope I shall see a great deal of him. But I know how easy it is\nfor a woman in my position to get talked about--and I have my little boy\nto consider.\"\n\nNevertheless, whenever Chelles came over from Beaulieu to spend a\nday with his aunt and cousin--an excursion he not infrequently\nrepeated--Undine was at no pains to conceal her pleasure. Nor was there\nanything calculated in her attitude. Chelles seemed to her more charming\nthan ever, and the warmth of his wooing was in flattering contrast to\nthe cool reserve of his manners. At last she felt herself alive and\nyoung again, and it became a joy to look in her glass and to try on her\nnew hats and dresses...\n\nThe only menace ahead was the usual one of the want of money. While she\nhad travelled with her parents she had been at relatively small expense,\nand since their return to America Mr. Spragg had sent her allowance\nregularly; yet almost all the money she had received for the pearls was\nalready gone, and she knew her Paris season would be far more expensive\nthan the quiet weeks on the Riviera.\n\nMeanwhile the sense of reviving popularity, and the charm of Chelles'\ndevotion, had almost effaced the ugly memories of failure, and\nrefurbished that image of herself in other minds which was her only\nnotion of self-seeing. Under the guidance of Madame de Trezac she had\nfound a prettily furnished apartment in a not too inaccessible quarter,\nand in its light bright drawing-room she sat one June afternoon\nlistening, with all the forbearance of which she was capable, to the\ncounsels of her newly-acquired guide.\n\n\"Everything but marriage--\" Madame de Trezac was repeating, her long\nhead slightly tilted, her features wearing the rapt look of an adept\nreciting a hallowed formula.\n\nRaymond de Chelles had not been mentioned by either of the ladies, and\nthe former Miss Wincher was merely imparting to her young friend one\nof the fundamental dogmas of her social creed; but Undine was conscious\nthat the air between them vibrated with an unspoken name. She made no\nimmediate answer, but her glance, passing by Madame de Trezac's\ndull countenance, sought her own reflection in the mirror behind her\nvisitor's chair. A beam of spring sunlight touched the living masses of\nher hair and made the face beneath as radiant as a girl's. Undine smiled\nfaintly at the promise her own eyes gave her, and then turned them back\nto her friend. \"What can such women know about anything?\" she thought\ncompassionately.\n\n\"There's everything against it,\" Madame de Trezac continued in a tone of\npatient exposition. She seemed to be doing her best to make the matter\nclear. \"In the first place, between people in society a religious\nmarriage is necessary; and, since the Church doesn't recognize divorce,\nthat's obviously out of the question. In France, a man of position who\ngoes through the form of civil marriage with a divorced woman is simply\nruining himself and her. They might much better--from her point of\nview as well as his--be 'friends,' as it's called over here: such\narrangements are understood and allowed for. But when a Frenchman\nmarries he wants to marry as his people always have. He knows there\nare traditions he can't fight against--and in his heart he's glad there\nare.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know: they've so much religious feeling. I admire that in them:\ntheir religion's so beautiful.\" Undine looked thoughtfully at her\nvisitor. \"I suppose even money--a great deal of money--wouldn't make the\nleast bit of difference?\"\n\n\"None whatever, except to make matters worse,\" Madame de Trezac\ndecisively rejoined. She returned Undine's look with something of Miss\nWincher's contemptuous authority. \"But,\" she added, softening to a\nsmile, \"between ourselves--I can say it, since we're neither of us\nchildren--a woman with tact, who's not in a position to remarry, will\nfind society extremely indulgent... provided, of course, she keeps up\nappearances...\"\n\nUndine turned to her with the frown of a startled Diana. \"We don't look\nat things that way out at Apex,\" she said coldly; and the blood rose in\nMadame de Trezac's sallow cheek.\n\n\"Oh, my dear, it's so refreshing to hear you talk like that! Personally,\nof course, I've never quite got used to the French view--\"\n\n\"I hope no American woman ever does,\" said Undine.\n\nShe had been in Paris for about two months when this conversation took\nplace, and in spite of her reviving self-confidence she was beginning to\nrecognize the strength of the forces opposed to her. It had taken a long\ntime to convince her that even money could not prevail against them;\nand, in the intervals of expressing her admiration for the Catholic\ncreed, she now had violent reactions of militant Protestantism, during\nwhich she talked of the tyranny of Rome and recalled school stories of\nimmoral Popes and persecuting Jesuits.\n\nMeanwhile her demeanour to Chelles was that of the incorruptible but\nfearless American woman, who cannot even conceive of love outside of\nmarriage, but is ready to give her devoted friendship to the man on\nwhom, in happier circumstances, she might have bestowed her hand. This\nattitude was provocative of many scenes, during which her suitor's\nunfailing powers of expression--his gift of looking and saying all\nthe desperate and devoted things a pretty woman likes to think she\ninspires--gave Undine the thrilling sense of breathing the very air of\nFrench fiction. But she was aware that too prolonged tension of these\ncords usually ends in their snapping, and that Chelles' patience was\nprobably in inverse ratio to his ardour.\n\nWhen Madame de Trezac had left her these thoughts remained in her mind.\nShe understood exactly what each of her new friends wanted of her. The\nPrincess, who was fond of her cousin, and had the French sense of family\nsolidarity, would have liked to see Chelles happy in what seemed to her\nthe only imaginable way. Madame de Trezac would have liked to do what\nshe could to second the Princess's efforts in this or any other\nline; and even the old Duchess--though piously desirous of seeing her\nfavourite nephew married--would have thought it not only natural but\ninevitable that, while awaiting that happy event, he should try to\ninduce an amiable young woman to mitigate the drawbacks of celibacy.\nMeanwhile, they might one and all weary of her if Chelles did; and\na persistent rejection of his suit would probably imperil her\nscarcely-gained footing among his friends. All this was clear to her,\nyet it did not shake her resolve. She was determined to give up Chelles\nunless he was willing to marry her; and the thought of her renunciation\nmoved her to a kind of wistful melancholy.\n\nIn this mood her mind reverted to a letter she had just received from\nher mother. Mrs. Spragg wrote more fully than usual, and the unwonted\nflow of her pen had been occasioned by an event for which she had long\nyearned. For months she had pined for a sight of her grandson, had tried\nto screw up her courage to write and ask permission to visit him, and,\nfinally breaking through her sedentary habits, had begun to haunt the\nneighbourhood of Washington Square, with the result that one afternoon\nshe had had the luck to meet the little boy coming out of the house with\nhis nurse. She had spoken to him, and he had remembered her and called\nher \"Granny\"; and the next day she had received a note from Mrs.\nFairford saying that Ralph would be glad to send Paul to see her. Mrs.\nSpragg enlarged on the delights of the visit and the growing beauty and\ncleverness of her grandson. She described to Undine exactly how Paul\nwas dressed, how he looked and what he said, and told her how he had\nexamined everything in the room, and, finally coming upon his mother's\nphotograph, had asked who the lady was; and, on being told, had wanted\nto know if she was a very long way off, and when Granny thought she\nwould come back.\n\nAs Undine re-read her mother's pages, she felt an unusual tightness\nin her throat and two tears rose to her eyes. It was dreadful that her\nlittle boy should be growing up far away from her, perhaps dressed in\nclothes she would have hated; and wicked and unnatural that when he saw\nher picture he should have to be told who she was. \"If I could only\nmeet some good man who would give me a home and be a father to him,\" she\nthought--and the tears overflowed and ran down.\n\nEven as they fell, the door was thrown open to admit Raymond de Chelles,\nand the consciousness of the moisture still glistening on her cheeks\nperhaps strengthened her resolve to resist him, and thus made her more\nimperiously to be desired. Certain it is that on that day her suitor\nfirst alluded to a possibility which Madame de Trezac had prudently\nrefrained from suggesting, there fell upon Undine's attentive ears the\nmagic phrase \"annulment of marriage.\"\n\nHer alert intelligence immediately set to work in this new direction;\nbut almost at the same moment she became aware of a subtle change\nof tone in the Princess and her mother, a change reflected in the\ncorresponding decline of Madame de Trezac's cordiality. Undine, since\nher arrival in Paris, had necessarily been less in the Princess's\ncompany, but when they met she had found her as friendly as ever. It was\nmanifestly not a failing of the Princess's to forget past favours, and\nthough increasingly absorbed by the demands of town life she treated her\nnew friend with the same affectionate frankness, and Undine was given\nfrequent opportunities to enlarge her Parisian acquaintance, not only in\nthe Princess's intimate circle but in the majestic drawing-rooms of\nthe Hotel de Dordogne. Now, however, there was a perceptible decline\nin these signs of hospitality, and Undine, on calling one day on\nthe Duchess, noticed that her appearance sent a visible flutter of\ndiscomfort through the circle about her hostess's chair. Two or three of\nthe ladies present looked away from the new-comer and at each other,\nand several of them seemed spontaneously to encircle without approaching\nher, while another--grey-haired, elderly and slightly frightened--with\nan \"Adieu, ma bonne tante\" to the Duchess, was hastily aided in her\nretreat down the long line of old gilded rooms.\n\nThe incident was too mute and rapid to have been noticeable had it not\nbeen followed by the Duchess's resuming her conversation with the ladies\nnearest her as though Undine had just gone out of the room instead of\nentering it. The sense of having been thus rendered invisible filled\nUndine with a vehement desire to make herself seen, and an equally\nstrong sense that all attempts to do so would be vain; and when, a few\nminutes later, she issued from the portals of the Hotel de Dordogne it\nwas with the fixed resolve not to enter them again till she had had an\nexplanation with the Princess.\n\nShe was spared the trouble of seeking one by the arrival, early the next\nmorning, of Madame de Trezac, who, entering almost with the breakfast\ntray, mysteriously asked to be allowed to communicate something of\nimportance.\n\n\"You'll understand, I know, the Princess's not coming herself--\" Madame\nde Trezac began, sitting up very straight on the edge of the arm-chair\nover which Undine's lace dressing-gown hung.\n\n\"If there's anything she wants to say to me, I don't,\" Undine answered,\nleaning back among her rosy pillows, and reflecting compassionately that\nthe face opposite her was just the colour of the caf\u00c3\u00a9 au lait she was\npouring out.\n\n\"There are things that are...that might seem too pointed...if one\nsaid them one's self,\" Madame de Trezac continued. \"Our dear Lili's\nso good-natured... she so hates to do anything unfriendly; but she\nnaturally thinks first of her mother...\"\n\n\"Her mother? What's the matter with her mother?\"\n\n\"I told her I knew you didn't understand. I was sure you'd take it in\ngood part...\"\n\nUndine raised herself on her elbow. \"What did Lili tell you to tell me?\"\n\n\"Oh, not to TELL you...simply to ask if, just for the present, you'd\nmind avoiding the Duchess's Thursdays ...calling on any other day, that\nis.\"\n\n\"Any other day? She's not at home on any other. Do you mean she doesn't\nwant me to call?\"\n\n\"Well--not while the Marquise de Chelles is in Paris. She's the\nDuchess's favourite niece--and of course they all hang together. That\nkind of family feeling is something you naturally don't--\"\n\nUndine had a sudden glimpse of hidden intricacies.\n\n\"That was Raymond de Chelles' mother I saw there yesterday? The one they\nhurried out when I came in?\"\n\n\"It seems she was very much upset. She somehow heard your name.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't she have heard my name? And why in the world should it\nupset her?\"\n\nMadame de Trezac heaved a hesitating sigh. \"Isn't it better to be frank?\nShe thinks she has reason to feel badly--they all do.\"\n\n\"To feel badly? Because her son wants to marry me?\"\n\n\"Of course they know that's impossible.\" Madame de Trezac smiled\ncompassionately. \"But they're afraid of your spoiling his other\nchances.\"\n\nUndine paused a moment before answering, \"It won't be impossible when my\nmarriage is annulled,\" she said.\n\nThe effect of this statement was less electrifying than she had hoped.\nHer visitor simply broke into a laugh. \"My dear child! Your marriage\nannulled? Who can have put such a mad idea into your head?\"\n\nUndine's gaze followed the pattern she was tracing with a lustrous nail\non her embroidered bedspread. \"Raymond himself,\" she let fall.\n\nThis time there was no mistaking the effect she produced. Madame de\nTrezac, with a murmured \"Oh,\" sat gazing before her as if she had\nlost the thread of her argument; and it was only after a considerable\ninterval that she recovered it sufficiently to exclaim: \"They'll never\nhear of it--absolutely never!\"\n\n\"But they can't prevent it, can they?\"\n\n\"They can prevent its being of any use to you.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Undine pensively assented.\n\nShe knew the tone she had taken was virtually a declaration of war; but\nshe was in a mood when the act of defiance, apart from its strategic\nvalue, was a satisfaction in itself. Moreover, if she could not gain\nher end without a fight it was better that the battle should be\nengaged while Raymond's ardour was at its height. To provoke immediate\nhostilities she sent for him the same afternoon, and related, quietly\nand without comment, the incident of her visit to the Duchess, and\nthe mission with which Madame de Trezac had been charged. In the\ncircumstances, she went on to explain, it was manifestly impossible\nthat she should continue to receive his visits; and she met his wrathful\ncomments on his relatives by the gently but firmly expressed resolve not\nto be the cause of any disagreement between himself and his family.\n\n\n\nXXX\n\nA few days after her decisive conversation with Raymond de Chelles,\nUndine, emerging from the doors of the Nouveau Luxe, where she had been\nto call on the newly-arrived Mrs. Homer Branney, once more found herself\nface to face with Elmer Moffatt.\n\nThis time there was no mistaking his eagerness to be recognized. He\nstopped short as they met, and she read such pleasure in his eyes that\nshe too stopped, holding out her hand.\n\n\"I'm glad you're going to speak to me,\" she said, and Moffatt reddened\nat the allusion.\n\n\"Well, I very nearly didn't. I didn't know you. You look about as old as\nyou did when I first landed at Apex--remember?\"\n\nHe turned back and began to walk at her side in the direction of the\nChamps Elysees.\n\n\"Say--this is all right!\" he exclaimed; and she saw that his glance had\nleft her and was ranging across the wide silvery square ahead of them to\nthe congregated domes and spires beyond the river.\n\n\"Do you like Paris?\" she asked, wondering what theatres he had been to.\n\n\"It beats everything.\" He seemed to be breathing in deeply the\nimpression of fountains, sculpture, leafy' avenues and long-drawn\narchitectural distances fading into the afternoon haze.\n\n\"I suppose you've been to that old church over there?\" he went on, his\ngold-topped stick pointing toward the towers of Notre Dame.\n\n\"Oh, of course; when I used to sightsee. Have you never been to Paris\nbefore?\"\n\n\"No, this is my first look-round. I came across in March.\"\n\n\"In March?\" she echoed inattentively. It never occurred to her that\nother people's lives went on when they were out of her range of vision,\nand she tried in vain to remember what she had last heard of Moffatt.\n\"Wasn't that a bad time to leave Wall Street?\"\n\n\"Well, so-so. Fact is, I was played out: needed a change.\" Nothing in\nhis robust mien confirmed the statement, and he did not seem inclined to\ndevelop it. \"I presume you're settled here now?\" he went on. \"I saw by\nthe papers--\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she interrupted; adding, after a moment: \"It was all a mistake\nfrom the first.\"\n\n\"Well, I never thought he was your form,\" said Moffatt.\n\nHis eyes had come back to her, and the look in them struck her as\nsomething she might use to her advantage; but the next moment he had\nglanced away with a furrowed brow, and she felt she had not wholly fixed\nhis attention.\n\n\"I live at the other end of Paris. Why not come back and have tea with\nme?\" she suggested, half moved by a desire to know more of his affairs,\nand half by the thought that a talk with him might help to shed some\nlight on hers.\n\nIn the open taxi-cab he seemed to recover his sense of well-being, and\nleaned back, his hands on the knob of his stick, with the air of a man\npleasantly aware of his privileges. \"This Paris is a thundering good\nplace,\" he repeated once or twice as they rolled on through the crush\nand glitter of the afternoon; and when they had descended at Undine's\ndoor, and he stood in her drawing-room, and looked out on the\nhorse-chestnut trees rounding their green domes under the balcony, his\nsatisfaction culminated in the comment: \"I guess this lays out West End\nAvenue!\"\n\nHis eyes met Undine's with their old twinkle, and their expression\nencouraged her to murmur: \"Of course there are times when I'm very\nlonely.\"\n\nShe sat down behind the tea-table, and he stood at a little distance,\nwatching her pull off her gloves with a queer comic twitch of his\nelastic mouth. \"Well, I guess it's only when you want to be,\" he said,\ngrasping a lyre-backed chair by its gilt cords, and sitting down astride\nof it, his light grey trousers stretching too tightly over his plump\nthighs. Undine was perfectly aware that he was a vulgar over-dressed\nman, with a red crease of fat above his collar and an impudent\nswaggering eye; yet she liked to see him there, and was conscious that\nhe stirred the fibres of a self she had forgotten but had not ceased to\nunderstand.\n\nShe had fancied her avowal of loneliness might call forth some\nsentimental phrase; but though Moffatt was clearly pleased to be\nwith her she saw that she was not the centre of his thoughts, and the\ndiscovery irritated her.\n\n\"I don't suppose YOU'VE known what it is to be lonely since you've been\nin Europe?\" she continued as she held out his tea-cup.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said jocosely, \"I don't always go round with a guide\"; and she\nrejoined on the same note: \"Then perhaps I shall see something of you.\"\n\n\"Why, there's nothing would suit me better; but the fact is, I'm\nprobably sailing next week.\"\n\n\"Oh, are you? I'm sorry.\" There was nothing feigned in her regret.\n\n\"Anything I can do for you across the pond?\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"There's something you can do for me right off.\"\n\nHe looked at her more attentively, as if his practised eve had passed\nthrough the surface of her beauty to what might be going on behind it.\n\"Do you want my blessing again?\" he asked with sudden irony.\n\nUndine opened her eyes with a trustful look. \"Yes--I do.\"\n\n\"Well--I'll be damned!\" said Moffatt gaily.\n\n\"You've always been so awfully nice,\" she began; and he leaned back,\ngrasping both sides of the chair-back, and shaking it a little with his\nlaugh.\n\nHe kept the same attitude while she proceeded to unfold her case,\nlistening to her with the air of sober concentration that his frivolous\nface took on at any serious demand on his attention. When she had ended\nhe kept the same look during an interval of silent pondering. \"Is it the\nfellow who was over at Nice with you that day?\"\n\nShe looked at him with surprise. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"Why, I liked his looks,\" said Moffatt simply. He got up and strolled\ntoward the window. On the way he stopped before a table covered with\nshowy trifles, and after looking at them for a moment singled out a dim\nold brown and golden book which Chelles had given her. He examined\nit lingeringly, as though it touched the spring of some choked-up\nsensibility for which he had no language. \"Say--\" he began: it was the\nusual prelude to his enthusiasms; but he laid the book down and turned\nback.\n\n\"Then you think if you had the cash you could fix it up all right with\nthe Pope?\"\n\nHer heart began to beat. She remembered that he had once put a job in\nRalph's way, and had let her understand that he had done it partly for\nher sake.\n\n\"Well,\" he continued, relapsing into hyperbole, \"I wish I could send the\nold gentleman my cheque to-morrow morning: but the fact is I'm high\nand dry.\" He looked at her with a sudden odd intensity. \"If I WASN'T, I\ndunno but what--\" The phrase was lost in his familiar whistle.\n\"That's an awfully fetching way you do your hair,\" he said. It was a\ndisappointment to Undine to hear that his affairs were not prospering,\nfor she knew that in his world \"pull\" and solvency were closely related,\nand that such support as she had hoped he might give her would be\ncontingent on his own situation. But she had again a fleeting sense of\nhis mysterious power of accomplishing things in the teeth of adversity;\nand she answered: \"What I want is your advice.\"\n\nHe turned away and wandered across the room, his hands in his pockets.\nOn her ornate writing desk he saw a photograph of Paul, bright-curled\nand sturdy-legged, in a manly reefer, and bent over it with a murmur of\napproval. \"Say--what a fellow! Got him with you?\"\n\nUndine coloured. \"No--\" she began; and seeing his look of surprise, she\nembarked on her usual explanation. \"I can't tell you how I miss him,\"\nshe ended, with a ring of truth that carried conviction to her own ears\nif not to Moffatt's.\n\n\"Why don't you get him back, then?\"\n\n\"Why, I--\"\n\nMoffatt had picked up the frame and was looking at the photograph more\nclosely. \"Pants!\" he chuckled. \"I declare!\"\n\nHe turned back to Undine. \"Who DOES he belong to, anyhow?\"\n\n\"Belong to?\"\n\n\"Who got him when you were divorced? Did you?\"\n\n\"Oh, I got everything,\" she said, her instinct of self-defense on the\nalert.\n\n\"So I thought.\" He stood before her, stoutly planted on his short legs,\nand speaking with an aggressive energy. \"Well, I know what I'd do if he\nwas mine.\"\n\n\"If he was yours?\"\n\n\"And you tried to get him away from me. Fight you to a finish! If it\ncost me down to my last dollar I would.\"\n\nThe conversation seemed to be wandering from the point, and she\nanswered, with a touch of impatience: \"It wouldn't cost you anything\nlike that. I haven't got a dollar to fight back with.\"\n\n\"Well, you ain't got to fight. Your decree gave him to you, didn't it?\nWhy don't you send right over and get him? That's what I'd do if I was\nyou.\"\n\nUndine looked up. \"But I'm awfully poor; I can't afford to have him\nhere.\"\n\n\"You couldn't, up to now; but now you're going to get married. You're\ngoing to be able to give him a home and a father's care--and the\nforeign languages. That's what I'd say if I was you...His father takes\nconsiderable stock in him, don't he?\"\n\nShe coloured, a denial on her lips; but she could not shape it. \"We're\nboth awfully fond of him, of course... His father'd never give him up!\"\n\n\"Just so.\" Moffatt's face had grown as sharp as glass. \"You've got the\nMarvells running. All you've got to do's to sit tight and wait for\ntheir cheque.\" He dropped back to his equestrian seat on the lyre-backed\nchair.\n\nUndine stood up and moved uneasily toward the window. She seemed to\nsee her little boy as though he were in the room with her; she did not\nunderstand how she could have lived so long without him...She stood for\na long time without speaking, feeling behind her the concentrated irony\nof Moffatt's gaze.\n\n\"You couldn't lend me the money--manage to borrow it for me, I mean?\"\nshe finally turned back to ask. He laughed. \"If I could manage to borrow\nany money at this particular minute--well, I'd have to lend every dollar\nof it to Elmer Moffatt, Esquire. I'm stone-broke, if you want to know.\nAnd wanted for an Investigation too. That's why I'm over here improving\nmy mind.\"\n\n\"Why, I thought you were going home next week?\"\n\nHe grinned. \"I am, because I've found out there's a party wants me to\nstay away worse than the courts want me back. Making the trip just for\nmy private satisfaction--there won't be any money in it, I'm afraid.\"\n\nLeaden disappointment descended on Undine. She had felt almost sure\nof Moffatt's helping her, and for an instant she wondered if some\nlong-smouldering jealousy had flamed up under its cold cinders. But\nanother look at his face denied her this solace; and his evident\nindifference was the last blow to her pride. The twinge it gave her\nprompted her to ask: \"Don't you ever mean to get married?\"\n\nMoffatt gave her a quick look. \"Why, I shouldn't wonder--one of these\ndays. Millionaires always collect something; but I've got to collect my\nmillions first.\"\n\nHe spoke coolly and half-humorously, and before he had ended she had\nlost all interest in his reply. He seemed aware of the fact, for he\nstood up and held out his hand. \"Well, so long, Mrs. Marvell. It's been\nuncommonly pleasant to see you; and you'd better think over what I've\nsaid.\"\n\nShe laid her hand sadly in his. \"You've never had a child,\" she replied.\n\n\n\nXXXI\n\nNearly two years had passed since Ralph Marvell, waking from his long\nsleep in the hot summer light of Washington Square, had found that the\nface of life was changed for him.\n\nIn the interval he had gradually adapted himself to the new order of\nthings; but the months of adaptation had been a time of such darkness\nand confusion that, from the vantage-ground of his recovered lucidity,\nhe could not yet distinguish the stages by which he had worked his way\nout; and even now his footing was not secure.\n\nHis first effort had been to readjust his values--to take an inventory\nof them, and reclassify them, so that one at least might be made to\nappear as important as those he had lost; otherwise there could be no\nreason why he should go on living. He applied himself doggedly to this\nattempt; but whenever he thought he had found a reason that his mind\ncould rest in, it gave way under him, and the old struggle for a\nfoothold began again. His two objects in life were his boy and his book.\nThe boy was incomparably the stronger argument, yet the less serviceable\nin filling the void. Ralph felt his son all the while, and all through\nhis other feelings; but he could not think about him actively and\ncontinuously, could not forever exercise his eager empty dissatisfied\nmind on the relatively simple problem of clothing, educating and amusing\na little boy of six. Yet Paul's existence was the all-sufficient reason\nfor his own; and he turned again, with a kind of cold fervour, to his\nabandoned literary dream. Material needs obliged him to go on with\nhis regular business; but, the day's work over, he was possessed of a\nleisure as bare and as blank as an unfurnished house, yet that was at\nleast his own to furnish as he pleased.\n\nMeanwhile he was beginning to show a presentable face to the world, and\nto be once more treated like a man in whose case no one is particularly\ninterested. His men friends ceased to say: \"Hallo, old chap, I never\nsaw you looking fitter!\" and elderly ladies no longer told him they were\nsure he kept too much to himself, and urged him to drop in any afternoon\nfor a quiet talk. People left him to his sorrow as a man is left to an\nincurable habit, an unfortunate tie: they ignored it, or looked over its\nhead if they happened to catch a glimpse of it at his elbow.\n\nThese glimpses were given to them more and more rarely. The smothered\nsprings of life were bubbling up in Ralph, and there were days when he\nwas glad to wake and see the sun in his window, and when he began to\nplan his book, and to fancy that the planning really interested him. He\ncould even maintain the delusion for several days--for intervals each\ntime appreciably longer--before it shrivelled up again in a scorching\nblast of disenchantment. The worst of it was that he could never tell\nwhen these hot gusts of anguish would overtake him. They came sometimes\njust when he felt most secure, when he was saying to himself: \"After\nall, things are really worth while--\" sometimes even when he was sitting\nwith Clare Van Degen, listening to her voice, watching her hands, and\nturning over in his mind the opening chapters of his book.\n\n\"You ought to write\"; they had one and all said it to him from the\nfirst; and he fancied he might have begun sooner if he had not\nbeen urged on by their watchful fondness. Everybody wanted him to\nwrite--everybody had decided that he ought to, that he would, that\nhe must be persuaded to; and the incessant imperceptible pressure of\nencouragement--the assumption of those about him that because it would\nbe good for him to write he must naturally be able to--acted on his\nrestive nerves as a stronger deterrent than disapproval.\n\nEven Clare had fallen into the same mistake; and one day, as he sat\ntalking with her on the verandah of Laura Fairford's house on the\nSound--where they now most frequently met--Ralph had half-impatiently\nrejoined: \"Oh, if you think it's literature I need--!\"\n\nInstantly he had seen her face change, and the speaking hands tremble on\nher knee. But she achieved the feat of not answering him, or turning\nher steady eyes from the dancing mid-summer water at the foot of Laura's\nlawn. Ralph leaned a little nearer, and for an instant his hand imagined\nthe flutter of hers. But instead of clasping it he drew back, and rising\nfrom his chair wandered away to the other end of the verandah...No, he\ndidn't feel as Clare felt. If he loved her--as he sometimes thought he\ndid--it was not in the same way. He had a great tenderness for her, he\nwas more nearly happy with her than with any one else; he liked to sit\nand talk with her, and watch her face and her hands, and he wished there\nwere some way--some different way--of letting her know it; but he could\nnot conceive that tenderness and desire could ever again be one for him:\nsuch a notion as that seemed part of the monstrous sentimental muddle on\nwhich his life had gone aground.\n\n\"I shall write--of course I shall write some day,\" he said, turning back\nto his seat. \"I've had a novel in the back of my head for years; and\nnow's the time to pull it out.\"\n\nHe hardly knew what he was saying; but before the end of the sentence he\nsaw that Clare had understood what he meant to convey, and henceforth he\nfelt committed to letting her talk to him as much as she pleased about\nhis book. He himself, in consequence, took to thinking about it more\nconsecutively; and just as his friends ceased to urge him to write, he\nsat down in earnest to begin.\n\nThe vision that had come to him had no likeness to any of his earlier\nimaginings. Two or three subjects had haunted him, pleading for\nexpression, during the first years of his marriage; but these now seemed\neither too lyrical or too tragic. He no longer saw life on the heroic\nscale: he wanted to do something in which men should look no bigger than\nthe insects they were. He contrived in the course of time to reduce one\nof his old subjects to these dimensions, and after nights of brooding he\nmade a dash at it, and wrote an opening chapter that struck him as\nnot too bad. In the exhilaration of this first attempt he spent some\npleasant evenings revising and polishing his work; and gradually a\nfeeling of authority and importance developed in him. In the morning,\nwhen he woke, instead of his habitual sense of lassitude, he felt an\neagerness to be up and doing, and a conviction that his individual task\nwas a necessary part of the world's machinery. He kept his secret with\nthe beginner's deadly fear of losing his hold on his half-real creations\nif he let in any outer light on them; but he went about with a more\nassured step, shrank less from meeting his friends, and even began to\ndine out again, and to laugh at some of the jokes he heard.\n\nLaura Fairford, to get Paul away from town, had gone early to the\ncountry; and Ralph, who went down to her every Saturday, usually found\nClare Van Degen there. Since his divorce he had never entered his\ncousin's pinnacled palace; and Clare had never asked him why he stayed\naway. This mutual silence had been their sole allusion to Van Degen's\nshare in the catastrophe, though Ralph had spoken frankly of its other\naspects. They talked, however, most often of impersonal subjects--books,\npictures, plays, or whatever the world that interested them was\ndoing--and she showed no desire to draw him back to his own affairs. She\nwas again staying late in town--to have a pretext, as he guessed, for\ncoming down on Sundays to the Fairfords'--and they often made the trip\ntogether in her motor; but he had not yet spoken to her of having begun\nhis book. One May evening, however, as they sat alone in the verandah,\nhe suddenly told her that he was writing. As he spoke his heart beat\nlike a boy's; but once the words were out they gave him a feeling of\nself-confidence, and he began to sketch his plan, and then to go into\nits details. Clare listened devoutly, her eyes burning on him through\nthe dusk like the stars deepening above the garden; and when she got up\nto go in he followed her with a new sense of reassurance.\n\nThe dinner that evening was unusually pleasant. Charles Bowen, just back\nfrom his usual spring travels, had come straight down to his friends\nfrom the steamer; and the fund of impressions he brought with him gave\nRalph a desire to be up and wandering. And why not--when the book was\ndone? He smiled across the table at Clare.\n\n\"Next summer you'll have to charter a yacht, and take us all off to\nthe Aegean. We can't have Charles condescending to us about the\nout-of-the-way places he's been seeing.\"\n\nWas it really he who was speaking, and his cousin who was sending\nhim back her dusky smile? Well--why not, again? The seasons renewed\nthemselves, and he too was putting out a new growth. \"My book--my\nbook--my book,\" kept repeating itself under all his thoughts, as\nUndine's name had once perpetually murmured there. That night as he went\nup to bed he said to himself that he was actually ceasing to think about\nhis wife...\n\nAs he passed Laura's door she called him in, and put her arms about him.\n\n\"You look so well, dear!\"\n\n\"But why shouldn't I?\" he answered gaily, as if ridiculing the fancy\nthat he had ever looked otherwise. Paul was sleeping behind the next\ndoor, and the sense of the boy's nearness gave him a warmer glow. His\nlittle world was rounding itself out again, and once more he felt safe\nand at peace in its circle.\n\nHis sister looked as if she had something more to say; but she merely\nkissed him good night, and he went up whistling to his room. The next\nmorning he was to take a walk with Clare, and while he lounged about the\ndrawing-room, waiting for her to come down, a servant came in with the\nSunday papers. Ralph picked one up, and was absently unfolding it when\nhis eye fell on his own name: a sight he had been spared since the last\nechoes of his divorce had subsided. His impulse was to fling the paper\ndown, to hurl it as far from him as he could; but a grim fascination\ntightened his hold and drew his eyes back to the hated head-line.\n\nNEW YORK BEAUTY WEDS FRENCH NOBLEMAN MRS. UNDINE MARVELL CONFIDENT POPE\nWILL ANNUL PREVIOUS MARRIAGE MRS. MARVELL TALKS ABOUT HER CASE\n\nThere it was before him in all its long-drawn horror--an \"interview\"--an\n\"interview\" of Undine's about her coming marriage! Ah, she talked about\nher case indeed! Her confidences filled the greater part of a column,\nand the only detail she seemed to have omitted was the name of her\nfuture husband, who was referred to by herself as \"my fianc\u00c3\u00a9\" and by\nthe interviewer as \"the Count\" or \"a prominent scion of the French\nnobility.\"\n\nRalph heard Laura's step behind him. He threw the paper aside and their\neyes met.\n\n\"Is this what you wanted to tell me last night?\"\n\n\"Last night?--Is it in the papers?\"\n\n\"Who told you? Bowen? What else has he heard?\"\n\n\"Oh, Ralph, what does it matter--what can it matter?\"\n\n\"Who's the man? Did he tell you that?\" Ralph insisted. He saw her\ngrowing agitation. \"Why can't you answer? Is it any one I know?\"\n\n\"He was told in Paris it was his friend Raymond de Chelles.\"\n\nRalph laughed, and his laugh sounded in his own ears like an echo of the\ndreary mirth with which he had filled Mr. Spragg's office the day he\nhad learned that Undine intended to divorce him. But now his wrath was\nseasoned with a wholesome irony. The fact of his wife's having reached\nanother stage in her ascent fell into its place as a part of the huge\nhuman buffoonery.\n\n\"Besides,\" Laura went on, \"it's all perfect nonsense, of course. How in\nthe world can she have her marriage annulled?\"\n\nRalph pondered: this put the matter in another light. \"With a great deal\nof money I suppose she might.\"\n\n\"Well, she certainly won't get that from Chelles. He's far from rich,\nCharles tells me.\" Laura waited, watching him, before she risked:\n\"That's what convinces me she wouldn't have him if she could.\"\n\nRalph shrugged. \"There may be other inducements. But she won't be able\nto manage it.\" He heard himself speaking quite collectedly. Had Undine\nat last lost her power of wounding him?\n\nClare came in, dressed for their walk, and under Laura's anxious eyes he\npicked up the newspaper and held it out with a careless: \"Look at this!\"\n\nHis cousin's glance flew down the column, and he saw the tremor of her\nlashes as she read. Then she lifted her head. \"But you'll be free!\" Her\nface was as vivid as a flower.\n\n\"Free? I'm free now, as far as that goes!\"\n\n\"Oh, but it will go so much farther when she has another name--when\nshe's a different person altogether! Then you'll really have Paul to\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Paul?\" Laura intervened with a nervous laugh. \"But there's never been\nthe least doubt about his having Paul!\"\n\nThey heard the boy's laughter on the lawn, and she went out to join him.\nRalph was still looking at his cousin.\n\n\"You're glad, then?\" came from him involuntarily; and she startled him\nby bursting into tears. He bent over and kissed her on the cheek.\n\n\n\nXXXII\n\nRalph, as the days passed, felt that Clare was right: if Undine married\nagain he would possess himself more completely, be more definitely rid\nof his past. And he did not doubt that she would gain her end: he knew\nher violent desires and her cold tenacity. If she had failed to\ncapture Van Degen it was probably because she lacked experience of\nthat particular type of man, of his huge immediate wants and feeble\nvacillating purposes; most of all, because she had not yet measured\nthe strength of the social considerations that restrained him. It was a\nmistake she was not likely to repeat, and her failure had probably been\na useful preliminary to success. It was a long time since Ralph had\nallowed himself to think of her, and as he did so the overwhelming fact\nof her beauty became present to him again, no longer as an element of\nhis being but as a power dispassionately estimated. He said to himself:\n\"Any man who can feel at all will feel it as I did\"; and the conviction\ngrew in him that Raymond de Chelles, of whom he had formed an idea\nthrough Bowen's talk, was not the man to give her up, even if she failed\nto obtain the release his religion exacted.\n\nMeanwhile Ralph was gradually beginning to feel himself freer and\nlighter. Undine's act, by cutting the last link between them, seemed to\nhave given him back to himself; and the mere fact that he could consider\nhis case in all its bearings, impartially and ironically, showed him the\ndistance he had travelled, the extent to which he had renewed himself.\nHe had been moved, too, by Clare's cry of joy at his release. Though\nthe nature of his feeling for her had not changed he was aware of a new\nquality in their friendship. When he went back to his book again his\nsense of power had lost its asperity, and the spectacle of life seemed\nless like a witless dangling of limp dolls. He was well on in his second\nchapter now.\n\nThis lightness of mood was still on him when, returning one afternoon to\nWashington Square, full of projects for a long evening's work, he found\nhis mother awaiting him with a strange face. He followed her into the\ndrawing-room, and she explained that there had been a telephone message\nshe didn't understand--something perfectly crazy about Paul--of course\nit was all a mistake...\n\nRalph's first thought was of an accident, and his heart contracted. \"Did\nLaura telephone?\"\n\n\"No, no; not Laura. It seemed to be a message from Mrs. Spragg:\nsomething about sending some one here to fetch him--a queer name like\nHeeny--to fetch him to a steamer on Saturday. I was to be sure to have\nhis things packed...but of course it's a misunderstanding...\" She gave\nan uncertain laugh, and looked up at Ralph as though entreating him to\nreturn the reassurance she had given him.\n\n\"Of course, of course,\" he echoed.\n\nHe made his mother repeat her statement; but the unforeseen always\nflurried her, and she was confused and inaccurate. She didn't actually\nknow who had telephoned: the voice hadn't sounded like Mrs. Spragg's...\nA woman's voice; yes--oh, not a lady's! And there was certainly\nsomething about a steamer...but he knew how the telephone bewildered\nher...and she was sure she was getting a little deaf. Hadn't he better\ncall up the Malibran? Of course it was all a mistake--but... well,\nperhaps he HAD better go there himself...\n\nAs he reached the front door a letter clinked in the box, and he saw\nhis name on an ordinary looking business envelope. He turned the\ndoor-handle, paused again, and stooped to take out the letter. It bore\nthe address of the firm of lawyers who had represented Undine in the\ndivorce proceedings and as he tore open the envelope Paul's name started\nout at him.\n\nMrs. Marvell had followed him into the hall, and her cry broke the\nsilence. \"Ralph--Ralph--is it anything she's done?\"\n\n\"Nothing--it's nothing.\" He stared at her. \"What's the day of the week?\"\n\n\"Wednesday. Why, what--?\" She suddenly seemed to understand. \"She's not\ngoing to take him away from us?\"\n\nRalph dropped into a chair, crumpling the letter in his hand. He had\nbeen in a dream, poor fool that he was--a dream about his child! He sat\ngazing at the type-written phrases that spun themselves out before\nhim. \"My client's circumstances now happily permitting... at last in\na position to offer her son a home...long separation...a mother's\nfeelings...every social and educational advantage\"...and then, at the\nend, the poisoned dart that struck him speechless: \"The courts having\nawarded her the sole custody...\"\n\nThe sole custody! But that meant that Paul was hers, hers only, hers\nfor always: that his father had no more claim on him than any casual\nstranger in the street! And he, Ralph Marvell, a sane man, young,\nable-bodied, in full possession of his wits, had assisted at the\nperpetration of this abominable wrong, had passively forfeited his right\nto the flesh of his body, the blood of his being! But it couldn't be--of\ncourse it couldn't be. The preposterousness of it proved that it wasn't\ntrue. There was a mistake somewhere; a mistake his own lawyer would\ninstantly rectify. If a hammer hadn't been drumming in his head he\ncould have recalled the terms of the decree--but for the moment all the\ndetails of the agonizing episode were lost in a blur of uncertainty.\n\nTo escape his mother's silent anguish of interrogation he stood up and\nsaid: \"I'll see Mr. Spragg--of course it's a mistake.\" But as he spoke\nhe retravelled the hateful months during the divorce proceedings,\nremembering his incomprehensible lassitude, his acquiescence in his\nfamily's determination to ignore the whole episode, and his gradual\nlapse into the same state of apathy. He recalled all the old family\ncatchwords, the full and elaborate vocabulary of evasion: \"delicacy,\"\n\"pride,\" \"personal dignity,\" \"preferring not to know about such things\";\nMrs. Marvell's: \"All I ask is that you won't mention the subject to\nyour grandfather,\" Mr. Dagonet's: \"Spare your mother, Ralph, whatever\nhappens,\" and even Laura's terrified: \"Of course, for Paul's sake, there\nmust be no scandal.\"\n\nFor Paul's sake! And it was because, for Paul's sake, there must be no\nscandal, that he, Paul's father, had tamely abstained from defending his\nrights and contesting his wife's charges, and had thus handed the child\nover to her keeping!\n\nAs his cab whirled him up Fifth Avenue, Ralph's whole body throbbed with\nrage against the influences that had reduced him to such weakness.\nThen, gradually, he saw that the weakness was innate in him. He had\nbeen eloquent enough, in his free youth, against the conventions of his\nclass; yet when the moment came to show his contempt for them they\nhad mysteriously mastered him, deflecting his course like some hidden\nhereditary failing. As he looked back it seemed as though even his great\ndisaster had been conventionalized and sentimentalized by this inherited\nattitude: that the thoughts he had thought about it were only those of\ngenerations of Dagonets, and that there had been nothing real and his\nown in his life but the foolish passion he had been trying so hard to\nthink out of existence.\n\nHalfway to the Malibran he changed his direction, and drove to the house\nof the lawyer he had consulted at the time of his divorce. The lawyer\nhad not yet come up town, and Ralph had a half hour of bitter meditation\nbefore the sound of a latch-key brought him to his feet. The visit did\nnot last long. His host, after an affable greeting, listened without\nsurprise to what he had to say, and when he had ended reminded him with\nsomewhat ironic precision that, at the time of the divorce, he had asked\nfor neither advice nor information--had simply declared that he wanted\nto \"turn his back on the whole business\" (Ralph recognized the phrase as\none of his grandfather's), and, on hearing that in that case he had only\nto abstain from action, and was in no need of legal services, had gone\naway without farther enquiries.\n\n\"You led me to infer you had your reasons--\" the slighted counsellor\nconcluded; and, in reply to Ralph's breathless question, he subjoined,\n\"Why, you see, the case is closed, and I don't exactly know on what\nground you can re-open it--unless, of course, you can bring evidence\nshowing that the irregularity of the mother's life is such...\"\n\n\"She's going to marry again,\" Ralph threw in.\n\n\"Indeed? Well, that in itself can hardly be described as irregular. In\nfact, in certain circumstances it might be construed as an advantage to\nthe child.\"\n\n\"Then I'm powerless?\"\n\n\"Why--unless there's an ulterior motive--through which pressure might be\nbrought to bear.\"\n\n\"You mean that the first thing to do is to find out what she's up to?\"\n\n\"Precisely. Of course, if it should prove to be a genuine case of\nmaternal feeling, I won't conceal from you that the outlook's bad. At\nmost, you could probably arrange to see your boy at stated intervals.\"\n\nTo see his boy at stated intervals! Ralph wondered how a sane man could\nsit there, looking responsible and efficient, and talk such rubbish...As\nhe got up to go the lawyer detained him to add: \"Of course there's no\nimmediate cause for alarm. It will take time to enforce the provision\nof the Dakota decree in New York, and till it's done your son can't\nbe taken from you. But there's sure to be a lot of nasty talk in the\npapers; and you're bound to lose in the end.\"\n\nRalph thanked him and left.\n\nHe sped northward to the Malibran, where he learned that Mr. and\nMrs. Spragg were at dinner. He sent his name down to the subterranean\nrestaurant, and Mr. Spragg presently appeared between the limp portieres\nof the \"Adam\" writing-room. He had grown older and heavier, as if\nillness instead of health had put more flesh on his bones, and there\nwere greyish tints in the hollows of his face.\n\n\"What's this about Paul?\" Ralph exclaimed. \"My mother's had a message we\ncan't make out.\"\n\nMr. Spragg sat down, with the effect of immersing his spinal column in\nthe depths of the arm-chair he selected. He crossed his legs, and swung\none foot to and fro in its high wrinkled boot with elastic sides.\n\n\"Didn't you get a letter?\" he asked.\n\n\"From my--from Undine's lawyers? Yes.\" Ralph held it out. \"It's queer\nreading. She hasn't hitherto been very keen to have Paul with her.\"\n\nMr. Spragg, adjusting his glasses, read the letter slowly, restored it\nto the envelope and gave it back. \"My daughter has intimated that she\nwishes these gentlemen to act for her. I haven't received any additional\ninstructions from her,\" he said, with none of the curtness of tone that\nhis stiff legal vocabulary implied.\n\n\"But the first communication I received was from you--at least from Mrs.\nSpragg.\"\n\nMr. Spragg drew his beard through his hand. \"The ladies are apt to be a\ntrifle hasty. I believe Mrs. Spragg had a letter yesterday instructing\nher to select a reliable escort for Paul; and I suppose she thought--\"\n\n\"Oh, this is all too preposterous!\" Ralph burst out, springing from\nhis seat. \"You don't for a moment imagine, do you--any of you--that\nI'm going to deliver up my son like a bale of goods in answer to any\ninstructions in God's world?--Oh, yes, I know--I let him go--I abandoned\nmy right to him...but I didn't know what I was doing...I was sick\nwith grief and misery. My people were awfully broken up over the whole\nbusiness, and I wanted to spare them. I wanted, above all, to spare my\nboy when he grew up. If I'd contested the case you know what the result\nwould have been. I let it go by default--I made no conditions all I\nwanted was to keep Paul, and never to let him hear a word against his\nmother!\"\n\nMr. Spragg received this passionate appeal in a silence that implied not\nso much disdain or indifference, as the total inability to deal verbally\nwith emotional crises. At length, he said, a slight unsteadiness in his\nusually calm tones: \"I presume at the time it was optional with you to\ndemand Paul's custody.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--it was optional,\" Ralph sneered.\n\nMr. Spragg looked at him compassionately. \"I'm sorry you didn't do it,\"\nhe said.\n\n\n\nXXXIII\n\nThe upshot of Ralph's visit was that Mr. Spragg, after considerable\ndeliberation, agreed, pending farther negotiations between the opposing\nlawyers, to undertake that no attempt should be made to remove Paul from\nhis father's custody. Nevertheless, he seemed to think it quite natural\nthat Undine, on the point of making a marriage which would put it in her\npower to give her child a suitable home, should assert her claim on him.\nIt was more disconcerting to Ralph to learn that Mrs. Spragg, for once\ndeparting from her attitude of passive impartiality, had eagerly abetted\nher daughter's move; he had somehow felt that Undine's desertion of the\nchild had established a kind of mute understanding between himself and\nhis mother-in-law.\n\n\"I thought Mrs. Spragg would know there's no earthly use trying to take\nPaul from me,\" he said with a desperate awkwardness of entreaty, and\nMr. Spragg startled him by replying: \"I presume his grandma thinks he'll\nbelong to her more if we keep him in the family.\"\n\nRalph, abruptly awakened from his dream of recovered peace, found\nhimself confronted on every side by. indifference or hostility: it was\nas though the June fields in which his boy was playing had suddenly\nopened to engulph him. Mrs. Marvell's fears and tremors were almost\nharder to bear than the Spraggs' antagonism; and for the next few days\nRalph wandered about miserably, dreading some fresh communication from\nUndine's lawyers, yet racked by the strain of hearing nothing more from\nthem. Mr. Spragg had agreed to cable his daughter asking her to await a\nletter before enforcing her demands; but on the fourth day after\nRalph's visit to the Malibran a telephone message summoned him to his\nfather-in-law's office.\n\nHalf an hour later their talk was over and he stood once more on the\nlanding outside Mr. Spragg's door. Undine's answer had come and Paul's\nfate was sealed. His mother refused to give him up, refused to await\nthe arrival of her lawyer's letter, and reiterated, in more peremptory\nlanguage, her demand that the child should be sent immediately to Paris\nin Mrs. Heeny's care.\n\nMr. Spragg, in face of Ralph's entreaties, remained pacific but remote.\nIt was evident that, though he had no wish to quarrel with Ralph, he saw\nno reason for resisting Undine. \"I guess she's got the law on her side,\"\nhe said; and in response to Ralph's passionate remonstrances he added\nfatalistically: \"I presume you'll have to leave the matter to my\ndaughter.\"\n\nRalph had gone to the office resolved to control his temper and keep\non the watch for any shred of information he might glean; but it soon\nbecame clear that Mr. Spragg knew as little as himself of Undine's\nprojects, or of the stage her plans had reached. All she had apparently\nvouchsafed her parent was the statement that she intended to re-marry,\nand the command to send Paul over; and Ralph reflected that his own\nbetrothal to her had probably been announced to Mr. Spragg in the same\ncurt fashion.\n\nThe thought brought back an overwhelming sense of the past. One by one\nthe details of that incredible moment revived, and he felt in his\nveins the glow of rapture with which he had first approached the dingy\nthreshold he was now leaving. There came back to him with peculiar\nvividness the memory of his rushing up to Mr. Spragg's office to consult\nhim about a necklace for Undine. Ralph recalled the incident because his\neager appeal for advice had been received by Mr. Spragg with the very\nphrase he had just used: \"I presume you'll have to leave the matter to\nmy daughter.\"\n\nRalph saw him slouching in his chair, swung sideways from the untidy\ndesk, his legs stretched out, his hands in his pockets, his jaws engaged\non the phantom tooth-pick; and, in a corner of the office, the figure of\na middle-sized red-faced young man who seemed to have been interrupted\nin the act of saying something disagreeable.\n\n\"Why, it must have been then that I first saw Moffatt,\" Ralph reflected;\nand the thought suggested the memory of other, subsequent meetings in\nthe same building, and of frequent ascents to Moffatt's office during\nthe ardent weeks of their mysterious and remunerative \"deal.\"\n\nRalph wondered if Moffatt's office were still in the Ararat; and on the\nway out he paused before the black tablet affixed to the wall of the\nvestibule and sought and found the name in its familiar place.\n\nThe next moment he was again absorbed in his own cares. Now that he had\nlearned the imminence of Paul's danger, and the futility of pleading for\ndelay, a thousand fantastic projects were contending in his head. To\nget the boy away--that seemed the first thing to do: to put him out of\nreach, and then invoke the law, get the case re-opened, and carry the\nfight from court to court till his rights should be recognized. It would\ncost a lot of money--well, the money would have to be found. The first\nstep was to secure the boy's temporary safety; after that, the question\nof ways and means would have to be considered...Had there ever been a\ntime, Ralph wondered, when that question hadn't been at the root of all\nthe others?\n\nHe had promised to let Clare Van Degen know the result of his visit, and\nhalf an hour later he was in her drawing-room. It was the first time he\nhad entered it since his divorce; but Van Degen was tarpon-fishing in\nCalifornia--and besides, he had to see Clare. His one relief was in\ntalking to her, in feverishly turning over with her every possibility of\ndelay and obstruction; and he marvelled at the intelligence and energy\nshe brought to the discussion of these questions. It was as if she had\nnever before felt strongly enough about anything to put her heart or her\nbrains into it; but now everything in her was at work for him.\n\nShe listened intently to what he told her; then she said: \"You tell me\nit will cost a great deal; but why take it to the courts at all? Why not\ngive the money to Undine instead of to your lawyers?\"\n\nRalph looked at her in surprise, and she continued: \"Why do you suppose\nshe's suddenly made up her mind she must have Paul?\"\n\n\"That's comprehensible enough to any one who knows her. She wants him\nbecause he'll give her the appearance of respectability. Having him with\nher will prove, as no mere assertions can, that all the rights are on\nher side and the 'wrongs' on mine.\"\n\nClare considered. \"Yes; that's the obvious answer. But shall I tell\nyou what I think, my dear? You and I are both completely out-of-date.\nI don't believe Undine cares a straw for 'the appearance of\nrespectability.' What she wants is the money for her annulment.\"\n\nRalph uttered an incredulous exclamation. \"But don't you see?\" she\nhurried on. \"It's her only hope--her last chance. She's much too clever\nto burden herself with the child merely to annoy you. What she wants is\nto make you buy him back from her.\" She stood up and came to him with\noutstretched hands. \"Perhaps I can be of use to you at last!\"\n\n\"You?\" He summoned up a haggard smile. \"As if you weren't\nalways--letting me load you with all my bothers!\"\n\n\"Oh, if only I've hit on the way out of this one! Then there wouldn't\nbe any others left!\" Her eyes followed him intently as he turned away\nto the window and stood staring down at the sultry prospect of Fifth\nAvenue. As he turned over her conjecture its probability became more\nand more apparent. It put into logical relation all the incoherencies\nof Undine's recent conduct, completed and defined her anew as if a sharp\nline had been drawn about her fading image.\n\n\"If it's that, I shall soon know,\" he said, turning back into the room.\nHis course had instantly become plain. He had only to resist and Undine\nwould have to show her hand. Simultaneously with this thought there\nsprang up in his mind the remembrance of the autumn afternoon in Paris\nwhen he had come home and found her, among her half-packed finery,\ndesperately bewailing her coming motherhood. Clare's touch was on his\narm. \"If I'm right--you WILL let me help?\"\n\nHe laid his hand on hers without speaking, and she went on:\n\n\"It will take a lot of money: all these law-suits do. Besides, she'd be\nashamed to sell him cheap. You must be ready to give her anything she\nwants. And I've got a lot saved up--money of my own, I mean...\"\n\n\"Your own?\" As he looked at her the rare blush rose under her brown\nskin.\n\n\"My very own. Why shouldn't you believe me? I've been hoarding up my\nscrap of an income for years, thinking that some day I'd find I couldn't\nstand this any longer...\" Her gesture embraced their sumptuous setting.\n\"But now I know I shall never budge. There are the children; and\nbesides, things are easier for me since--\" she paused, embarrassed.\n\n\"Yes, yes; I know.\" He felt like completing her phrase: \"Since my wife\nhas furnished you with the means of putting pressure on your husband--\"\nbut he simply repeated: \"I know.\"\n\n\"And you WILL let me help?\"\n\n\"Oh, we must get at the facts first.\" He caught her hands in his with\nsudden energy. \"As you say, when Paul's safe there won't be another\nbother left!\"\n\n\n\nXXXIV\n\nThe means of raising the requisite amount of money became, during the\nnext few weeks, the anxious theme of all Ralph's thoughts. His lawyers'\nenquiries soon brought the confirmation of Clare's surmise, and it\nbecame clear that--for reasons swathed in all the ingenuities of legal\nverbiage--Undine might, in return for a substantial consideration, be\nprevailed on to admit that it was for her son's advantage to remain with\nhis father.\n\nThe day this admission was communicated to Ralph his first impulse was\nto carry the news to his cousin. His mood was one of pure exaltation;\nhe seemed to be hugging his boy to him as he walked. Paul and he were to\nbelong to each other forever: no mysterious threat of separation could\never menace them again! He had the blissful sense of relief that the\nchild himself might have had on waking out of a frightened dream and\nfinding the jolly daylight in his room.\n\nClare at once renewed her entreaty to be allowed to aid in ransoming\nher little cousin, but Ralph tried to put her off by explaining that he\nmeant to \"look about.\"\n\n\"Look where? In the Dagonet coffers? Oh, Ralph, what's the use of\npretending? Tell me what you've got to give her.\" It was amazing how\nhis cousin suddenly dominated him. But as yet he couldn't go into the\ndetails of the bargain. That the reckoning between himself and Undine\nshould be settled in dollars and cents seemed the last bitterest satire\non his dreams: he felt himself miserably diminished by the smallness of\nwhat had filled his world.\n\nNevertheless, the looking about had to be done; and a day came when\nhe found himself once more at the door of Elmer Moffatt's office. His\nthoughts had been drawn back to Moffatt by the insistence with which\nthe latter's name had lately been put forward by the press in connection\nwith a revival of the Ararat investigation. Moffatt, it appeared, had\nbeen regarded as one of the most valuable witnesses for the State;\nhis return from Europe had been anxiously awaited, his unreadiness to\ntestify caustically criticized; then at last he had arrived, had gone on\nto Washington--and had apparently had nothing to tell.\n\nRalph was too deep in his own troubles to waste any wonder over this\nanticlimax; but the frequent appearance of Moffatt's name in the morning\npapers acted as an unconscious suggestion. Besides, to whom else could\nhe look for help? The sum his wife demanded could be acquired only by \"a\nquick turn,\" and the fact that Ralph had once rendered the same kind\nof service to Moffatt made it natural to appeal to him now. The market,\nmoreover, happened to be booming, and it seemed not unlikely that so\nexperienced a speculator might have a \"good thing\" up his sleeve.\n\nMoffatt's office had been transformed since Ralph's last visit.\nPaint, varnish and brass railings gave an air of opulence to the outer\nprecincts, and the inner room, with its mahogany bookcases containing\nmorocco-bound \"sets\" and its wide blue leather arm-chairs, lacked only\na palm or two to resemble the lounge of a fashionable hotel. Moffatt\nhimself, as he came forward, gave Ralph the impression of having been\ndone over by the same hand: he was smoother, broader, more supremely\ntailored, and his whole person exhaled the faintest whiff of an\nexpensive scent. He installed his visitor in one of the blue arm-chairs,\nand sitting opposite, an elbow on his impressive \"Washington\" desk,\nlistened attentively while Ralph made his request.\n\n\"You want to be put onto something good in a damned hurry?\" Moffatt\ntwisted his moustache between two plump square-tipped fingers with\na little black growth on their lower joints. \"I don't suppose,\" he\nremarked, \"there's a sane man between here and San Francisco who isn't\nconsumed by that yearning.\"\n\nHaving permitted himself this pleasantry he passed on to business.\n\"Yes--it's a first-rate time to buy: no doubt of that. But you say you\nwant to make a quick turn-over? Heard of a soft thing that won't wait,\nI presume? That's apt to be the way with soft things--all kinds of 'em.\nThere's always other fellows after them.\" Moffatt's smile was playful.\n\"Well, I'd go considerably out of my way to do you a good turn, because\nyou did me one when I needed it mighty bad. 'In youth you sheltered me.'\nYes, sir, that's the kind I am.\" He stood up, sauntered to the other\nside of the room, and took a small object from the top of the bookcase.\n\n\"Fond of these pink crystals?\" He held the oriental toy against the\nlight. \"Oh, I ain't a judge--but now and then I like to pick up a pretty\nthing.\" Ralph noticed that his eyes caressed it.\n\n\"Well--now let's talk. You say you've got to have the funds for\nyour--your investment within three weeks. That's quick work. And you\nwant a hundred thousand. Can you put up fifty?\"\n\nRalph had been prepared for the question, but when it came he felt a\nmoment's tremor. He knew he could count on half the amount from\nhis grandfather; could possibly ask Fairford for a small additional\nloan--but what of the rest? Well, there was Clare. He had always known\nthere would be no other way. And after all, the money was Clare's--it\nwas Dagonet money. At least she said it was. All the misery of his\npredicament was distilled into the short silence that preceded his\nanswer: \"Yes--I think so.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess I can double it for you.\" Moffatt spoke with an air of\nOlympian modesty. \"Anyhow, I'll try. Only don't tell the other girls!\"\n\nHe proceeded to develop his plan to ears which Ralph tried to make alert\nand attentive, but in which perpetually, through the intricate concert\nof facts and figures, there broke the shout of a small boy racing across\na suburban lawn. \"When I pick him up to-night he'll be mine for good!\"\nRalph thought as Moffatt summed up: \"There's the whole scheme in a\nnut-shell; but you'd better think it over. I don't want to let you in\nfor anything you ain't quite sure about.\" \"Oh, if you're sure--\" Ralph\nwas already calculating the time it would take to dash up to Clare Van\nDegen's on his way to catch the train for the Fairfords'.\n\nHis impatience made it hard to pay due regard to Moffatt's parting\ncivilities. \"Glad to have seen you,\" he heard the latter assuring him\nwith a final hand-grasp. \"Wish you'd dine with me some evening at my\nclub\"; and, as Ralph murmured a vague acceptance: \"How's that boy of\nyours, by the way?\" Moffatt continued. \"He was a stunning chap last time\nI saw him.--Excuse me if I've put my foot in it; but I understood you\nkept him with you...? Yes: that's what I thought.... Well, so long.\"\n\nClare's inner sitting-room was empty; but the servant, presently\nreturning, led Ralph into the gilded and tapestried wilderness where she\noccasionally chose to receive her visitors. There, under Popple's effigy\nof herself, she sat, small and alone, on a monumental sofa behind a\ntea-table laden with gold plate; while from his lofty frame, on the\nopposite wall Van Degen, portrayed by a \"powerful\" artist, cast on her\nthe satisfied eye of proprietorship.\n\nRalph, swept forward on the blast of his excitement, felt as in a dream\nthe frivolous perversity of her receiving him in such a setting instead\nof in their usual quiet corner; but there was no room in his mind for\nanything but the cry that broke from him: \"I believe I've done it!\"\n\nHe sat down and explained to her by what means, trying, as best he\ncould, to restate the particulars of Moffatt's deal; and her manifest\nignorance of business methods had the effect of making his vagueness\nappear less vague.\n\n\"Anyhow, he seems to be sure it's a safe thing. I understand he's in\nwith Rolliver now, and Rolliver practically controls Apex. This is some\nkind of a scheme to buy up all the works of public utility at Apex.\nThey're practically sure of their charter, and Moffatt tells me I can\ncount on doubling my investment within a few weeks. Of course I'll go\ninto the details if you like--\"\n\n\"Oh, no; you've made it all so clear to me!\" She really made him feel he\nhad. \"And besides, what on earth does it matter? The great thing is\nthat it's done.\" She lifted her sparkling eyes. \"And now--my share--you\nhaven't told me...\"\n\nHe explained that Mr. Dagonet, to whom he had already named the amount\ndemanded, had at once promised him twenty-five thousand dollars, to\nbe eventually deducted from his share of the estate. His mother had\nsomething put by that she insisted on contributing; and Henley Fairford,\nof his own accord, had come forward with ten thousand: it was awfully\ndecent of Henley...\n\n\"Even Henley!\" Clare sighed. \"Then I'm the only one left out?\"\n\nRalph felt the colour in his face. \"Well, you see, I shall need as much\nas fifty--\"\n\nHer hands flew together joyfully. \"But then you've got to let me help!\nOh, I'm so glad--so glad! I've twenty thousand waiting.\"\n\nHe looked about the room, checked anew by all its oppressive\nimplications. \"You're a darling...but I couldn't take it.\"\n\n\"I've told you it's mine, every penny of it!\"\n\n\"Yes; but supposing things went wrong?\"\n\n\"Nothing CAN--if you'll only take it...\"\n\n\"I may lose it--\"\n\n\"_I_ sha'n't, if I've given it to you!\" Her look followed his about the\nroom and then came back to him. \"Can't you imagine all it will make up\nfor?\"\n\nThe rapture of the cry caught him up with it. Ah, yes, he could imagine\nit all! He stooped his head above her hands. \"I accept,\" he said; and\nthey stood and looked at each other like radiant children.\n\nShe followed him to the door, and as he turned to leave he broke into a\nlaugh. \"It's queer, though, its happening in this room!\"\n\nShe was close beside him, her hand on the heavy tapestry curtaining\nthe door; and her glance shot past him to her husband's portrait. Ralph\ncaught the look, and a flood of old tendernesses and hates welled up in\nhim. He drew her under the portrait and kissed her vehemently.\n\n\n\nXXXV\n\nWithin forty-eight hours Ralph's money was in Moffatt's hands, and the\ninterval of suspense had begun.\n\nThe transaction over, he felt the deceptive buoyancy that follows on\nperiods of painful indecision. It seemed to him that now at last life\nhad freed him from all trammelling delusions, leaving him only the best\nthing in its gift--his boy.\n\nThe things he meant Paul to do and to be filled his fancy with happy\npictures. The child was growing more and more interesting--throwing out\ncountless tendrils of feeling and perception that delighted Ralph but\npreoccupied the watchful Laura.\n\n\"He's going to be exactly like you, Ralph--\" she paused and then risked\nit: \"For his own sake, I wish there were just a drop or two of Spragg in\nhim.\"\n\nRalph laughed, understanding her. \"Oh, the plodding citizen I've become\nwill keep him from taking after the lyric idiot who begot him. Paul and\nI, between us, are going to turn out something first-rate.\"\n\nHis book too was spreading and throwing out tendrils, and he worked\nat it in the white heat of energy which his factitious exhilaration\nproduced. For a few weeks everything he did and said seemed as easy and\nunconditioned as the actions in a dream.\n\nClare Van Degen, in the light of this mood, became again the comrade\nof his boyhood. He did not see her often, for she had gone down to the\ncountry with her children, but they communicated daily by letter or\ntelephone, and now and then she came over to the Fairfords' for a night.\nThere they renewed the long rambles of their youth, and once more the\nsummer fields and woods seemed full of magic presences. Clare was no\nmore intelligent, she followed him no farther in his flights; but some\nof the qualities that had become most precious to him were as native to\nher as its perfume to a flower. So, through the long June afternoons,\nthey ranged together over many themes; and if her answers sometimes\nmissed the mark it did not matter, because her silences never did.\n\nMeanwhile Ralph, from various sources, continued to pick up a good deal\nof more or less contradictory information about Elmer Moffatt. It seemed\nto be generally understood that Moffatt had come back from Europe with\nthe intention of testifying in the Ararat investigation, and that his\nformer patron, the great Harmon B. Driscoll, had managed to silence him;\nand it was implied that the price of this silence, which was set at\na considerable figure, had been turned to account in a series of\nspeculations likely to lift Moffatt to permanent eminence among the\nrulers of Wall Street. The stories as to his latest achievement, and\nthe theories as to the man himself, varied with the visual angle of\neach reporter: and whenever any attempt was made to focus his hard sharp\npersonality some guardian divinity seemed to throw a veil of mystery\nover him. His detractors, however, were the first to own that there\nwas \"something about him\"; it was felt that he had passed beyond the\nmeteoric stage, and the business world was unanimous in recognizing\nthat he had \"come to stay.\" A dawning sense of his stability was even\nbeginning to make itself felt in Fifth Avenue. It was said that he had\nbought a house in Seventy-second Street, then that he meant to build\nnear the Park; one or two people (always \"taken by a friend\") had been\nto his flat in the Pactolus, to see his Chinese porcelains and Persian\nrugs; now and then he had a few important men to dine at a Fifth Avenue\nrestaurant; his name began to appear in philanthropic reports and on\nmunicipal committees (there were even rumours of its having been put\nup at a well-known club); and the rector of a wealthy parish, who was\nraising funds for a chantry, was known to have met him at dinner and to\nhave stated afterward that \"the man was not wholly a materialist.\"\n\nAll these converging proofs of Moffatt's solidity strengthened Ralph's\nfaith in his venture. He remembered with what astuteness and authority\nMoffatt had conducted their real estate transaction--how far off and\nunreal it all seemed!--and awaited events with the passive faith of a\nsufferer in the hands of a skilful surgeon.\n\nThe days moved on toward the end of June, and each morning Ralph opened\nhis newspaper with a keener thrill of expectation. Any day now he might\nread of the granting of the Apex charter: Moffatt had assured him it\nwould \"go through\" before the close of the month. But the announcement\ndid not appear, and after what seemed to Ralph a decent lapse of time\nhe telephoned to ask for news. Moffatt was away, and when he came back a\nfew days later he answered Ralph's enquiries evasively, with an edge of\nirritation in his voice. The same day Ralph received a letter from his\nlawyer, who had been reminded by Mrs. Marvell's representatives that the\nlatest date agreed on for the execution of the financial agreement was\nthe end of the following week.\n\nRalph, alarmed, betook himself at once to the Ararat, and his first\nglimpse of Moffatt's round common face and fastidiously dressed person\ngave him an immediate sense of reassurance. He felt that under the\ncircle of baldness on top of that carefully brushed head lay the\nsolution of every monetary problem that could beset the soul of man.\nMoffatt's voice had recovered its usual cordial note, and the warmth of\nhis welcome dispelled Ralph's last apprehension.\n\n\"Why, yes, everything's going along first-rate. They thought they'd hung\nus up last week--but they haven't. There may be another week's delay;\nbut we ought to be opening a bottle of wine on it by the Fourth.\"\n\nAn office-boy came in with a name on a slip of paper, and Moffatt looked\nat his watch and held out a hearty hand. \"Glad you came. Of course I'll\nkeep you posted...No, this way...Look in again...\" and he steered Ralph\nout by another door.\n\nJuly came, and passed into its second week. Ralph's lawyer had obtained\na postponement from the other side, but Undine's representatives had\ngiven him to understand that the transaction must be closed before the\nfirst of August. Ralph telephoned once or twice to Moffatt, receiving\ngenially-worded assurances that everything was \"going their way\"; but he\nfelt a certain embarrassment in returning again to the office, and\nlet himself drift through the days in a state of hungry apprehension.\nFinally one afternoon Henley Fairford, coming back from town (which\nRalph had left in the morning to join his boy over Sunday), brought word\nthat the Apex consolidation scheme had failed to get its charter. It was\nuseless to attempt to reach Moffatt on Sunday, and Ralph wore on as he\ncould through the succeeding twenty-four hours. Clare Van Degen had come\ndown to stay with her youngest boy, and in the afternoon she and Ralph\ntook the two children for a sail. A light breeze brightened the waters\nof the Sound, and they ran down the shore before it and then tacked out\ntoward the sunset, coming back at last, under a failing breeze, as the\nsummer sky passed from blue to a translucid green and then into the\naccumulating greys of twilight.\n\nAs they left the landing and walked up behind the children across the\ndarkening lawn, a sense of security descended again on Ralph. He could\nnot believe that such a scene and such a mood could be the disguise of\nany impending evil, and all his doubts and anxieties fell away from him.\n\nThe next morning, he and Clare travelled up to town together, and at the\nstation he put her in the motor which was to take her to Long Island,\nand hastened down to Moffatt's office. When he arrived he was told that\nMoffatt was \"engaged,\" and he had to wait for nearly half an hour in\nthe outer office, where, to the steady click of the type-writer and\nthe spasmodic buzzing of the telephone, his thoughts again began their\nrestless circlings. Finally the inner door opened, and he found himself\nin the sanctuary. Moffatt was seated behind his desk, examining another\nlittle crystal vase somewhat like the one he had shown Ralph a few\nweeks earlier. As his visitor entered, he held it up against the light,\nrevealing on its dewy sides an incised design as frail as the shadow of\ngrass-blades on water.\n\n\"Ain't she a peach?\" He put the toy down and reached across the desk to\nshake hands. \"Well, well,\" he went on, leaning back in his chair, and\npushing out his lower lip in a half-comic pout, \"they've got us in the\nneck this time and no mistake. Seen this morning's Radiator? I don't\nknow how the thing leaked out--but the reformers somehow got a smell of\nthe scheme, and whenever they get swishing round something's bound to\nget spilt.\"\n\nHe talked gaily, genially, in his roundest tones and with his easiest\ngestures; never had he conveyed a completer sense of unhurried power;\nbut Ralph noticed for the first time the crow's-feet about his eyes, and\nthe sharpness of the contrast between the white of his forehead and the\nredness of the fold of neck above his collar.\n\n\"Do you mean to say it's not going through?\"\n\n\"Not this time, anyhow. We're high and dry.\"\n\nSomething seemed to snap in Ralph's head, and he sat down in the nearest\nchair. \"Has the common stock dropped a lot?\"\n\n\"Well, you've got to lean over to see it.\" Moffatt pressed his\nfinger-tips together and added thoughtfully: \"But it's THERE all right.\nWe're bound to get our charter in the end.\"\n\n\"What do you call the end?\"\n\n\"Oh, before the Day of Judgment, sure: next year, I guess.\"\n\n\"Next year?\" Ralph flushed. \"What earthly good will that do me?\"\n\n\"I don't say it's as pleasant as driving your best girl home by\nmoonlight. But that's how it is. And the stuff's safe enough any\nway--I've told you that right along.\"\n\n\"But you've told me all along I could count on a rise before August. You\nknew I had to have the money now.\"\n\n\"I knew you WANTED to have the money now; and so did I, and several of\nmy friends. I put you onto it because it was the only thing in sight\nlikely to give you the return you wanted.\"\n\n\"You ought at least to have warned me of the risk!\"\n\n\"Risk? I don't call it much of a risk to lie back in your chair and wait\nanother few months for fifty thousand to drop into your lap. I tell you\nthe thing's as safe as a bank.\"\n\n\"How do I know it is? You've misled me about it from the first.\"\n\nMoffatt's face grew dark red to the forehead: for the first time in\ntheir acquaintance Ralph saw him on the verge of anger. \"Well, if you\nget stuck so do I. I'm in it a good deal deeper than you. That's about\nthe best guarantee I can give; unless you won't take my word for that\neither.\" To control himself Moffatt spoke with extreme deliberation,\nseparating his syllables like a machine cutting something into even\nlengths.\n\nRalph listened through a cloud of confusion; but he saw the madness\nof offending Moffatt, and tried to take a more conciliatory tone. \"Of\ncourse I take your word for it. But I can't--I simply can't afford to\nlose...\"\n\n\"You ain't going to lose: I don't believe you'll even have to put up any\nmargin. It's THERE safe enough, I tell you...\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; I understand. I'm sure you wouldn't have advised me--\"\nRalph's tongue seemed swollen, and he had difficulty in bringing out the\nwords. \"Only, you see--I can't wait; it's not possible; and I want to\nknow if there isn't a way--\"\n\nMoffatt looked at him with a sort of resigned compassion, as a doctor\nlooks at a despairing mother who will not understand what he has tried\nto imply without uttering the word she dreads. Ralph understood the\nlook, but hurried on.\n\n\"You'll think I'm mad, or an ass, to talk like this; but the fact is, I\nmust have the money.\" He waited and drew a hard breath. \"I must have it:\nthat's all. Perhaps I'd better tell you--\"\n\nMoffatt, who had risen, as if assuming that the interview was over, sat\ndown again and turned an attentive look on him. \"Go ahead,\" he said,\nmore humanly than he had hitherto spoken.\n\n\"My boy...you spoke of him the other day... I'm awfully fond of him--\"\nRalph broke off, deterred by the impossibility of confiding his feeling\nfor Paul to this coarse-grained man with whom he hadn't a sentiment in\ncommon.\n\nMoffatt was still looking at him. \"I should say you would be! He's as\nsmart a little chap as I ever saw; and I guess he's the kind that gets\nbetter every day.\"\n\nRalph had collected himself, and went on with sudden resolution: \"Well,\nyou see--when my wife and I separated, I never dreamed she'd want the\nboy: the question never came up. If it had, of course--but she'd left\nhim with me when she went away two years before, and at the time of the\ndivorce I was a fool...I didn't take the proper steps...\"\n\n\"You mean she's got sole custody?\"\n\nRalph made a sign of assent, and Moffatt pondered. \"That's bad--bad.\"\n\n\"And now I understand she's going to marry again--and of course I can't\ngive up my son.\"\n\n\"She wants you to, eh?\"\n\nRalph again assented.\n\nMoffatt swung his chair about and leaned back in it, stretching out his\nplump legs and contemplating the tips of his varnished boots. He hummed\na low tune behind inscrutable lips.\n\n\"That's what you want the money for?\" he finally raised his head to ask.\n\nThe word came out of the depths of Ralph's anguish: \"Yes.\"\n\n\"And why you want it in such a hurry. I see.\" Moffatt reverted to the\nstudy of his boots. \"It's a lot of money.\"\n\n\"Yes. That's the difficulty. And I...she...\"\n\nRalph's tongue was again too thick for his mouth. \"I'm afraid she won't\nwait...or take less...\"\n\nMoffatt, abandoning the boots, was scrutinizing him through half-shut\nlids. \"No,\" he said slowly, \"I don't believe Undine Spragg'll take a\nsingle cent less.\"\n\nRalph felt himself whiten. Was it insolence or ignorance that had\nprompted Moffatt's speech? Nothing in his voice or face showed the\nsense of any shades of expression or of feeling: he seemed to apply\nto everything the measure of the same crude flippancy. But such\nconsiderations could not curb Ralph now. He said to himself \"Keep your\ntemper--keep your temper--\" and his anger suddenly boiled over.\n\n\"Look here, Moffatt,\" he said, getting to his feet, \"the fact that I've\nbeen divorced from Mrs. Marvell doesn't authorize any one to take that\ntone to me in speaking of her.\"\n\nMoffatt met the challenge with a calm stare under which there were\ndawning signs of surprise and interest. \"That so? Well, if that's the\ncase I presume I ought to feel the same way: I've been divorced from her\nmyself.\"\n\nFor an instant the words conveyed no meaning to Ralph; then they surged\nup into his brain and flung him forward with half-raised arm. But he\nfelt the grotesqueness of the gesture and his arm dropped back to his\nside. A series of unimportant and irrelevant things raced through his\nmind; then obscurity settled down on it. \"THIS man...THIS man...\" was\nthe one fiery point in his darkened consciousness.... \"What on earth are\nyou talking about?\" he brought out.\n\n\"Why, facts,\" said Moffatt, in a cool half-humorous voice. \"You didn't\nknow? I understood from Mrs. Marvell your folks had a prejudice against\ndivorce, so I suppose she kept quiet about that early episode. The truth\nis,\" he continued amicably, \"I wouldn't have alluded to it now if you\nhadn't taken rather a high tone with me about our little venture; but\nnow it's out I guess you may as well hear the whole story. It's mighty\nwholesome for a man to have a round now and then with a few facts. Shall\nI go on?\"\n\nRalph had stood listening without a sign, but as Moffatt ended he made a\nslight motion of acquiescence. He did not otherwise change his attitude,\nexcept to grasp with one hand the back of the chair that Moffatt pushed\ntoward him.\n\n\"Rather stand?...\" Moffatt himself dropped back into his seat and took\nthe pose of easy narrative. \"Well, it was this way. Undine Spragg and\nI were made one at Opake, Nebraska, just nine years ago last month. My!\nShe was a beauty then. Nothing much had happened to her before but being\nengaged for a year or two to a soft called Millard Binch; the same she\npassed on to Indiana Rolliver; and--well, I guess she liked the change.\nWe didn't have what you'd called a society wedding: no best man or\nbridesmaids or Voice that Breathed o'er Eden. Fact is, Pa and Ma didn't\nknow about it till it was over. But it was a marriage fast enough, as\nthey found out when they tried to undo it. Trouble was, they caught on\ntoo soon; we only had a fortnight. Then they hauled Undine back to Apex,\nand--well, I hadn't the cash or the pull to fight 'em. Uncle Abner was a\npretty big man out there then; and he had James J. Rolliver behind\nhim. I always know when I'm licked; and I was licked that time. So we\nunlooped the loop, and they fixed it up for me to make a trip to Alaska.\nLet me see--that was the year before they moved over to New York. Next\ntime I saw Undine I sat alongside of her at the theatre the day your\nengagement was announced.\"\n\nHe still kept to his half-humorous minor key, as though he were in the\nfirst stages of an after-dinner speech; but as he went on his bodily\npresence, which hitherto had seemed to Ralph the mere average garment of\nvulgarity, began to loom, huge and portentous as some monster released\nfrom a magician's bottle. His redness, his glossiness, his baldness, and\nthe carefully brushed ring of hair encircling it; the square line of his\nshoulders, the too careful fit of his clothes, the prominent lustre of\nhis scarf-pin, the growth of short black hair on his manicured hands,\neven the tiny cracks and crows'-feet beginning to show in the hard close\nsurface of his complexion: all these solid witnesses to his reality\nand his proximity pressed on Ralph with the mounting pang of physical\nnausea.\n\n\"THIS man...THIS man...\" he couldn't get beyond the thought: whichever\nway he turned his haggard thought, there was Moffatt bodily blocking the\nperspective...Ralph's eyes roamed toward the crystal toy that stood\non the desk beside Moffatt's hand. Faugh! That such a hand should have\ntouched it!\n\nSuddenly he heard himself speaking. \"Before my marriage--did you know\nthey hadn't told me?\"\n\n\"Why, I understood as much...\"\n\nRalph pushed on: \"You knew it the day I met you in Mr. Spragg's office?\"\n\nMoffatt considered a moment, as if the incident had escaped him. \"Did we\nmeet there?\" He seemed benevolently ready for enlightenment. But Ralph\nhad been assailed by another memory; he recalled that Moffatt had dined\none night in his house, that he and the man who now faced him had sat\nat the same table, their wife between them... He was seized with another\ndumb gust of fury; but it died out and left him face to face with the\nuselessness, the irrelevance of all the old attitudes of appropriation\nand defiance. He seemed to be stumbling about in his inherited\nprejudices like a modern man in mediaeval armour... Moffatt still sat at\nhis desk, unmoved and apparently uncomprehending. \"He doesn't even\nknow what I'm feeling,\" flashed through Ralph; and the whole archaic\nstructure of his rites and sanctions tumbled down about him.\n\nThrough the noise of the crash he heard Moffatt's voice going on without\nperceptible change of tone: \"About that other matter now...you can't\nfeel any meaner about it than I do, I can tell you that... but all we've\ngot to do is to sit tight...\"\n\nRalph turned from the voice, and found himself outside on the landing,\nand then in the street below.\n\n\n\nXXXVI\n\nHe stood at the corner of Wall Street, looking up and down its hot\nsummer perspective. He noticed the swirls of dust in the cracks of the\npavement, the rubbish in the gutters, the ceaseless stream of perspiring\nfaces that poured by under tilted hats.\n\nHe found himself, next, slipping northward between the glazed walls of\nthe Subway, another languid crowd in the seats about him and the nasal\nyelp of the stations ringing through the car like some repeated ritual\nwail. The blindness within him seemed to have intensified his physical\nperceptions, his sensitiveness to the heat, the noise, the smells of the\ndishevelled midsummer city; but combined with the acuter perception of\nthese offenses was a complete indifference to them, as though he were\nsome vivisected animal deprived of the power of discrimination.\n\nNow he had turned into Waverly Place, and was walking westward\ntoward Washington Square. At the corner he pulled himself up, saying\nhalf-aloud: \"The office--I ought to be at the office.\" He drew out his\nwatch and stared at it blankly. What the devil had he taken it out for?\nHe had to go through a laborious process of readjustment to find out\nwhat it had to say.... Twelve o'clock.... Should he turn back to the\noffice? It seemed easier to cross the square, go up the steps of the old\nhouse and slip his key into the door....\n\nThe house was empty. His mother, a few days previously, had departed\nwith Mr. Dagonet for their usual two months on the Maine coast, where\nRalph was to join them with his boy.... The blinds were all drawn down,\nand the freshness and silence of the marble-paved hall laid soothing\nhands on him.... He said to himself: \"I'll jump into a cab presently,\nand go and lunch at the club--\" He laid down his hat and stick and\nclimbed the carpetless stairs to his room. When he entered it he had\nthe shock of feeling himself in a strange place: it did not seem like\nanything he had ever seen before. Then, one by one, all the old stale\nusual things in it confronted him, and he longed with a sick intensity\nto be in a place that was really strange.\n\n\"How on earth can I go on living here?\" he wondered.\n\nA careless servant had left the outer shutters open, and the sun was\nbeating on the window-panes. Ralph pushed open the windows, shut the\nshutters, and wandered toward his arm-chair. Beads of perspiration stood\non his forehead: the temperature of the room reminded him of the heat\nunder the ilexes of the Sienese villa where he and Undine had sat\nthrough a long July afternoon. He saw her before him, leaning against\nthe tree-trunk in her white dress, limpid and inscrutable.... \"We\nwere made one at Opake, Nebraska....\" Had she been thinking of it that\nafternoon at Siena, he wondered? Did she ever think of it at all?... It\nwas she who had asked Moffatt to dine. She had said: \"Father brought\nhim home one day at Apex.... I don't remember ever having seen him\nsince\"--and the man she spoke of had had her in his arms ... and perhaps\nit was really all she remembered!\n\nShe had lied to him--lied to him from the first ... there hadn't been\na moment when she hadn't lied to him, deliberately, ingeniously and\ninventively. As he thought of it, there came to him, for the first time\nin months, that overwhelming sense of her physical nearness which had\nonce so haunted and tortured him. Her freshness, her fragrance, the\nluminous haze of her youth, filled the room with a mocking glory; and he\ndropped his head on his hands to shut it out....\n\nThe vision was swept away by another wave of hurrying thoughts. He felt\nit was intensely important that he should keep the thread of every one\nof them, that they all represented things to be said or done, or guarded\nagainst; and his mind, with the unwondering versatility and tireless\nhaste of the dreamer's brain, seemed to be pursuing them all\nsimultaneously. Then they became as unreal and meaningless as the red\nspecks dancing behind the lids against which he had pressed his fists\nclenched, and he had the feeling that if he opened his eyes they would\nvanish, and the familiar daylight look in on him....\n\nA knock disturbed him. The old parlour-maid who was always left in\ncharge of the house had come up to ask if he wasn't well, and if there\nwas anything she could do for him. He told her no ... he was perfectly\nwell ... or, rather, no, he wasn't ... he supposed it must be the heat;\nand he began to scold her for having forgotten to close the shutters.\n\nIt wasn't her fault, it appeared, but Eliza's: her tone implied that he\nknew what one had to expect of Eliza ... and wouldn't he go down to the\nnice cool shady dining-room, and let her make him an iced drink and a\nfew sandwiches?\n\n\"I've always told Mrs. Marvell I couldn't turn my back for a second\nbut what Eliza'd find a way to make trouble,\" the old woman continued,\nevidently glad of the chance to air a perennial grievance. \"It's not\nonly the things she FORGETS to do,\" she added significantly; and it\ndawned on Ralph that she was making an appeal to him, expecting him to\ntake sides with her in the chronic conflict between herself and Eliza.\nHe said to himself that perhaps she was right ... that perhaps there was\nsomething he ought to do ... that his mother was old, and didn't always\nsee things; and for a while his mind revolved this problem with feverish\nintensity....\n\n\"Then you'll come down, sir?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe door closed, and he heard her heavy heels along the passage.\n\n\"But the money--where's the money to come from?\" The question sprang out\nfrom some denser fold of the fog in his brain. The money--how on earth\nwas he to pay it back? How could he have wasted his time in thinking of\nanything else while that central difficulty existed?\n\n\"But I can't ... I can't ... it's gone ... and even if it weren't....\"\nHe dropped back in his chair and took his head between his hands. He had\nforgotten what he wanted the money for. He made a great effort to regain\nhold of the idea, but all the whirring, shuttling, flying had abruptly\nceased in his brain, and he sat with his eyes shut, staring straight\ninto darkness.... The clock struck, and he remembered that he had said\nhe would go down to the dining-room. \"If I don't she'll come up--\" He\nraised his head and sat listening for the sound of the old woman's step:\nit seemed to him perfectly intolerable that any one should cross the\nthreshold of the room again.\n\n\"Why can't they leave me alone?\" he groaned.... At length through the\nsilence of the empty house, he fancied he heard a door opening and\nclosing far below; and he said to himself: \"She's coming.\"\n\nHe got to his feet and went to the door. He didn't feel anything now\nexcept the insane dread of hearing the woman's steps come nearer. He\nbolted the door and stood looking about the room. For a moment he was\nconscious of seeing it in every detail with a distinctness he had never\nbefore known; then everything in it vanished but the single narrow panel\nof a drawer under one of the bookcases. He went up to the drawer, knelt\ndown and slipped his hand into it.\n\nAs he raised himself he listened again, and this time he distinctly\nheard the old servant's steps on the stairs. He passed his left hand\nover the side of his head, and down the curve of the skull behind the\near. He said to himself: \"My wife ... this will make it all right for\nher....\" and a last flash of irony twitched through him. Then he felt\nagain, more deliberately, for the spot he wanted, and put the muzzle of\nhis revolver against it.\n\n\n\nXXXVII\n\nIn a drawing-room hung with portraits of high-nosed personages in\nperukes and orders, a circle of ladies and gentlemen, looking not\nunlike every-day versions of the official figures above their heads, sat\nexamining with friendly interest a little boy in mourning.\n\nThe boy was slim, fair and shy, and his small black figure, islanded\nin the middle of the wide lustrous floor, looked curiously lonely\nand remote. This effect of remoteness seemed to strike his mother as\nsomething intentional, and almost naughty, for after having launched him\nfrom the door, and waited to judge of the impression he produced, she\ncame forward and, giving him a slight push, said impatiently: \"Paul! Why\ndon't you go and kiss your new granny?\"\n\nThe boy, without turning to her, or moving, sent his blue glance gravely\nabout the circle. \"Does she want me to?\" he asked, in a tone of evident\napprehension; and on his mother's answering: \"Of course, you silly!\" he\nadded earnestly: \"How many more do you think there'll be?\"\n\nUndine blushed to the ripples of her brilliant hair. \"I never knew such\na child! They've turned him into a perfect little savage!\"\n\nRaymond de Chelles advanced from behind his mother's chair.\n\n\"He won't be a savage long with me,\" he said, stooping down so that his\nfatigued finely-drawn face was close to Paul's. Their eyes met and\nthe boy smiled. \"Come along, old chap,\" Chelles continued in English,\ndrawing the little boy after him.\n\n\"Il est bien beau,\" the Marquise de Chelles observed, her eyes turning\nfrom Paul's grave face to her daughter-in-law's vivid countenance.\n\n\"Do be nice, darling! Say, 'bonjour, Madame,'\" Undine urged.\n\nAn odd mingling of emotions stirred in her while she stood watching Paul\nmake the round of the family group under her husband's guidance. It\nwas \"lovely\" to have the child back, and to find him, after their three\nyears' separation, grown into so endearing a figure: her first glimpse\nof him when, in Mrs. Heeny's arms, he had emerged that morning from the\nsteamer train, had shown what an acquisition he would be. If she had\nhad any lingering doubts on the point, the impression produced on her\nhusband would have dispelled them. Chelles had been instantly charmed,\nand Paul, in a shy confused way, was already responding to his advances.\nThe Count and Countess Raymond had returned but a few weeks before\nfrom their protracted wedding journey, and were staying--as they were\napparently to do whenever they came to Paris--with the old Marquis,\nRaymond's father, who had amicably proposed that little Paul Marvell\nshould also share the hospitality of the Hotel de Chelles. Undine, at\nfirst, was somewhat dismayed to find that she was expected to fit the\nboy and his nurse into a corner of her contracted entresol. But the\npossibility of a mother's not finding room for her son, however cramped\nher own quarters, seemed not to have occurred to her new relations, and\nthe preparing of her dressing-room and boudoir for Paul's occupancy was\ncarried on by the household with a zeal which obliged her to dissemble\nher lukewarmness.\n\nUndine had supposed that on her marriage one of the great suites of\nthe Hotel de Chelles would be emptied of its tenants and put at her\nhusband's disposal; but she had since learned that, even had such a plan\noccurred to her parents-in-law, considerations of economy would have\nhindered it. The old Marquis and his wife, who were content, when they\ncame up from Burgundy in the spring, with a modest set of rooms looking\nout on the court of their ancestral residence, expected their son and\nhis wife to fit themselves into the still smaller apartment which\nhad served as Raymond's bachelor lodging. The rest of the fine old\nmouldering house--the tall-windowed premier on the garden, and the whole\nof the floor above--had been let for years to old fashioned tenants\nwho would have been more surprised than their landlord had he suddenly\nproposed to dispossess them. Undine, at first, had regarded these\narrangements as merely provisional. She was persuaded that, under her\ninfluence, Raymond would soon convert his parents to more modern ideas,\nand meanwhile she was still in the flush of a completer well-being than\nshe had ever known, and disposed, for the moment, to make light of any\ninconveniences connected with it. The three months since her marriage\nhad been more nearly like what she had dreamed of than any of her\nprevious experiments in happiness. At last she had what she wanted, and\nfor the first time the glow of triumph was warmed by a deeper feeling.\nHer husband was really charming (it was odd how he reminded her of\nRalph!), and after her bitter two years of loneliness and humiliation it\nwas delicious to find herself once more adored and protected.\n\nThe very fact that Raymond was more jealous of her than Ralph had ever\nbeen--or at any rate less reluctant to show it--gave her a keener sense\nof recovered power. None of the men who had been in love with her before\nhad been so frankly possessive, or so eager for reciprocal assurances\nof constancy. She knew that Ralph had suffered deeply from her intimacy\nwith Van Degen, but he had betrayed his feeling only by a more studied\ndetachment; and Van Degen, from the first, had been contemptuously\nindifferent to what she did or felt when she was out of his sight. As to\nher earlier experiences, she had frankly forgotten them: her sentimental\nmemories went back no farther than the beginning of her New York career.\n\nRaymond seemed to attach more importance to love, in all its\nmanifestations, than was usual or convenient in a husband; and she\ngradually began to be aware that her domination over him involved a\ncorresponding loss of independence. Since their return to Paris she had\nfound that she was expected to give a circumstantial report of every\nhour she spent away from him. She had nothing to hide, and no designs\nagainst his peace of mind except those connected with her frequent and\ncostly sessions at the dress-makers'; but she had never before been\ncalled upon to account to any one for the use of her time, and after the\nfirst amused surprise at Raymond's always wanting to know where she had\nbeen and whom she had seen she began to be oppressed by so exacting a\ndevotion. Her parents, from her tenderest youth, had tacitly recognized\nher inalienable right to \"go round,\" and Ralph--though from motives\nwhich she divined to be different--had shown the same respect for her\nfreedom. It was therefore disconcerting to find that Raymond expected\nher to choose her friends, and even her acquaintances, in conformity not\nonly with his personal tastes but with a definite and complicated code\nof family prejudices and traditions; and she was especially surprised to\ndiscover that he viewed with disapproval her intimacy with the Princess\nEstradina.\n\n\"My cousin's extremely amusing, of course, but utterly mad and very mal\nentour\u00c3\u00a9e. Most of the people she has about her ought to be in prison or\nBedlam: especially that unspeakable Madame Adelschein, who's a candidate\nfor both. My aunt's an angel, but she's been weak enough to let Lili\nturn the Hotel de Dordogne into an annex of Montmartre. Of course you'll\nhave to show yourself there now and then: in these days families like\nours must hold together. But go to the reunions de famille rather than\nto Lili's intimate parties; go with me, or with my mother; don't let\nyourself be seen there alone. You're too young and good-looking to be\nmixed up with that crew. A woman's classed--or rather unclassed--by\nbeing known as one of Lili's set.\"\n\nAgreeable as it was to Undine that an appeal to her discretion should\nbe based on the ground of her youth and good-looks, she was dismayed\nto find herself cut off from the very circle she had meant them to\nestablish her in. Before she had become Raymond's wife there had been a\nmoment of sharp tension in her relations with the Princess Estradina and\nthe old Duchess. They had done their best to prevent her marrying their\ncousin, and had gone so far as openly to accuse her of being the cause\nof a breach between themselves and his parents. But Ralph Marvell's\ndeath had brought about a sudden change in her situation. She was now no\nlonger a divorced woman struggling to obtain ecclesiastical sanction\nfor her remarriage, but a widow whose conspicuous beauty and independent\nsituation made her the object of lawful aspirations. The first person to\nseize on this distinction and make the most of it was her old enemy the\nMarquise de Trezac. The latter, who had been loudly charged by the\nhouse of Chelles with furthering her beautiful compatriot's designs,\nhad instantly seen a chance of vindicating herself by taking the widowed\nMrs. Marvell under her wing and favouring the attentions of other\nsuitors. These were not lacking, and the expected result had followed.\nRaymond de Chelles, more than ever infatuated as attainment became less\ncertain, had claimed a definite promise from Undine, and his family,\ndiscouraged by his persistent bachelorhood, and their failure to fix his\nattention on any of the amiable maidens obviously designed to continue\nthe race, had ended by withdrawing their opposition and discovering in\nMrs. Marvell the moral and financial merits necessary to justify their\nchange of front.\n\n\"A good match? If she isn't, I should like to know what the Chelles call\none!\" Madame de Trezac went about indefatigably proclaiming. \"Related to\nthe best people in New York--well, by marriage, that is; and her husband\nleft much more money than was expected. It goes to the boy, of course;\nbut as the boy is with his mother she naturally enjoys the income. And\nher father's a rich man--much richer than is generally known; I mean\nwhat WE call rich in America, you understand!\"\n\nMadame de Trezac had lately discovered that the proper attitude for\nthe American married abroad was that of a militant patriotism; and she\nflaunted Undine Marvell in the face of the Faubourg like a particularly\nshowy specimen of her national banner. The success of the experiment\nemboldened her to throw off the most sacred observances of her past. She\ntook up Madame Adelschein, she entertained the James J. Rollivers,\nshe resuscitated Creole dishes, she patronized negro melodists, she\nabandoned her weekly teas for impromptu afternoon dances, and the prim\ndrawing-room in which dowagers had droned echoed with a cosmopolitan\nhubbub.\n\nEven when the period of tension was over, and Undine had been officially\nreceived into the family of her betrothed, Madame de Trezac did not\nat once surrender. She laughingly professed to have had enough of the\nproprieties, and declared herself bored by the social rites she had\nhitherto so piously performed. \"You'll always find a corner of home\nhere, dearest, when you get tired of their ceremonies and solemnities,\"\nshe said as she embraced the bride after the wedding breakfast; and\nUndine hoped that the devoted Nettie would in fact provide a refuge from\nthe extreme domesticity of her new state. But since her return to Paris,\nand her taking up her domicile in the Hotel de Chelles, she had found\nMadame de Trezac less and less disposed to abet her in any assertion of\nindependence.\n\n\"My dear, a woman must adopt her husband's nationality whether she wants\nto or not. It's the law, and it's the custom besides. If you wanted\nto amuse yourself with your Nouveau Luxe friends you oughtn't to have\nmarried Raymond--but of course I say that only in joke. As if any woman\nwould have hesitated who'd had your chance! Take my advice--keep out of\nLili's set just at first. Later ... well, perhaps Raymond won't be so\nparticular; but meanwhile you'd make a great mistake to go against his\npeople--\" and Madame de Trezac, with a \"Chere Madame,\" swept forward\nfrom her tea-table to receive the first of the returning dowagers.\n\nIt was about this time that Mrs. Heeny arrived with Paul; and for a\nwhile Undine was pleasantly absorbed in her boy. She kept Mrs. Heeny\nin Paris for a fortnight, and between her more pressing occupations it\namused her to listen to the masseuse's New York gossip and her comments\non the social organization of the old world. It was Mrs. Heeny's first\nvisit to Europe, and she confessed to Undine that she had always wanted\nto \"see something of the aristocracy\"--using the phrase as a naturalist\nmight, with no hint of personal pretensions. Mrs. Heeny's democratic\nease was combined with the strictest professional discretion, and it\nwould never have occurred to her to regard herself, or to wish others\nto regard her, as anything but a manipulator of muscles; but in that\ncharacter she felt herself entitled to admission to the highest circles.\n\n\"They certainly do things with style over here--but it's kinder\none-horse after New York, ain't it? Is this what they call their season?\nWhy, you dined home two nights last week. They ought to come over to New\nYork and see!\" And she poured into Undine's half-envious ear a list of\nthe entertainments which had illuminated the last weeks of the New York\nwinter. \"I suppose you'll begin to give parties as soon as ever you get\ninto a house of your own. You're not going to have one? Oh, well,\nthen you'll give a lot of big week-ends at your place down in the\nShatter-country--that's where the swells all go to in the summer time,\nain't it? But I dunno what your ma would say if she knew you were going\nto live on with HIS folks after you're done honey-mooning. Why, we read\nin the papers you were going to live in some grand hotel or other--oh,\nthey call their houses HOTELS, do they? That's funny: I suppose it's\nbecause they let out part of 'em. Well, you look handsomer than ever.\nUndine; I'll take THAT back to your mother, anyhow. And he's dead\nin love, I can see that; reminds me of the way--\" but she broke off\nsuddenly, as if something in Undine's look had silenced her.\n\nEven to herself. Undine did not like to call up the image of Ralph\nMarvell; and any mention of his name gave her a vague sense of distress.\nHis death had released her, had given her what she wanted; yet she could\nhonestly say to herself that she had not wanted him to die--at least\nnot to die like that.... People said at the time that it was the hot\nweather--his own family had said so: he had never quite got over his\nattack of pneumonia, and the sudden rise of temperature--one of the\nfierce \"heat-waves\" that devastate New York in summer--had probably\naffected his brain: the doctors said such cases were not uncommon....\nShe had worn black for a few weeks--not quite mourning, but something\ndecently regretful (the dress-makers were beginning to provide a special\ngarb for such cases); and even since her remarriage, and the lapse of\na year, she continued to wish that she could have got what she wanted\nwithout having had to pay that particular price for it.\n\nThis feeling was intensified by an incident--in itself far from\nunwelcome--which had occurred about three months after Ralph's death.\nHer lawyers had written to say that the sum of a hundred thousand\ndollars had been paid over to Marvell's estate by the Apex Consolidation\nCompany; and as Marvell had left a will bequeathing everything he\npossessed to his son, this unexpected windfall handsomely increased\nPaul's patrimony. Undine had never relinquished her claim on her child;\nshe had merely, by the advice of her lawyers, waived the assertion\nof her right for a few months after Marvell's death, with the express\nstipulation that her doing so was only a temporary concession to the\nfeelings of her husband's family; and she had held out against all\nattempts to induce her to surrender Paul permanently. Before her\nmarriage she had somewhat conspicuously adopted her husband's creed, and\nthe Dagonets, picturing Paul as the prey of the Jesuits, had made the\nmistake of appealing to the courts for his custody. This had confirmed\nUndine's resistance, and her determination to keep the child. The case\nhad been decided in her favour, and she had thereupon demanded, and\nobtained, an allowance of five thousand dollars, to be devoted to the\nbringing up and education of her son. This sum, added to what Mr. Spragg\nhad agreed to give her, made up an income which had appreciably bettered\nher position, and justified Madame de Trezac's discreet allusions to\nher wealth. Nevertheless, it was one of the facts about which she least\nliked to think when any chance allusion evoked Ralph's image. The\nmoney was hers, of course; she had a right to it, and she was an ardent\nbeliever in \"rights.\" But she wished she could have got it in some\nother way--she hated the thought of it as one more instance of the\nperverseness with which things she was entitled to always came to her as\nif they had been stolen.\n\nThe approach of summer, and the culmination of the Paris season, swept\naside such thoughts. The Countess Raymond de Chelles, contrasting\nher situation with that of Mrs. Undine Marvell, and the fulness and\nanimation of her new life with the vacant dissatisfied days which\nhad followed on her return from Dakota, forgot the smallness of her\napartment, the inconvenient proximity of Paul and his nurse, the\ninterminable round of visits with her mother-in-law, and the long\ndinners in the solemn hotels of all the family connection. The world was\nradiant, the lights were lit, the music playing; she was still young,\nand better-looking than ever, with a Countess's coronet, a famous\nchateau and a handsome and popular husband who adored her. And then\nsuddenly the lights went out and the music stopped when one day Raymond,\nputting his arm about her, said in his tenderest tones: \"And now, my\ndear, the world's had you long enough and it's my turn. What do you say\nto going down to Saint Desert?\"\n\n\n\nXXXVIII\n\nIn a window of the long gallery of the chateau de Saint Desert the\nnew Marquise de Chelles stood looking down the poplar avenue into the\nNovember rain. It had been raining heavily and persistently for a longer\ntime than she could remember. Day after day the hills beyond the park\nhad been curtained by motionless clouds, the gutters of the long steep\nroofs had gurgled with a perpetual overflow, the opaque surface of the\nmoat been peppered by a continuous pelting of big drops. The water lay\nin glassy stretches under the trees and along the sodden edges of the\ngarden-paths, it rose in a white mist from the fields beyond, it exuded\nin a chill moisture from the brick flooring of the passages and from\nthe walls of the rooms on the lower floor. Everything in the great empty\nhouse smelt of dampness: the stuffing of the chairs, the threadbare\nfolds of the faded curtains, the splendid tapestries, that were fading\ntoo, on the walls of the room in which Undine stood, and the wide bands\nof crape which her husband had insisted on her keeping on her black\ndresses till the last hour of her mourning for the old Marquis.\n\nThe summer had been more than usually inclement, and since her first\ncoming to the country Undine had lived through many periods of rainy\nweather; but none which had gone before had so completely epitomized, so\nsummed up in one vast monotonous blur, the image of her long months at\nSaint Desert.\n\nWhen, the year before, she had reluctantly suffered herself to be torn\nfrom the joys of Paris, she had been sustained by the belief that her\nexile would not be of long duration. Once Paris was out of sight, she\nhad even found a certain lazy charm in the long warm days at Saint\nDesert. Her parents-in-law had remained in town, and she enjoyed being\nalone with her husband, exploring and appraising the treasures of the\ngreat half abandoned house, and watching her boy scamper over the June\nmeadows or trot about the gardens on the poney his stepfather had given\nhim. Paul, after Mrs. Heeny's departure, had grown fretful and restive,\nand Undine had found it more and more difficult to fit his small\nexacting personality into her cramped rooms and crowded life. He\nirritated her by pining for his Aunt Laura, his Marvell granny, and\nold Mr. Dagonet's funny stories about gods and fairies; and his wistful\nallusions to his games with Clare's children sounded like a lesson he\nmight have been drilled in to make her feel how little he belonged to\nher. But once released from Paris, and blessed with rabbits, a poney\nand the freedom of the fields, he became again all that a charming\nchild should be, and for a time it amused her to share in his romps\nand rambles. Raymond seemed enchanted at the picture they made, and the\nquiet weeks of fresh air and outdoor activity gave her back a bloom that\nreflected itself in her tranquillized mood. She was the more resigned to\nthis interlude because she was so sure of its not lasting. Before they\nleft Paris a doctor had been found to say that Paul--who was certainly\nlooking pale and pulled-down--was in urgent need of sea air, and Undine\nhad nearly convinced her husband of the expediency of hiring a chalet at\nDeauville for July and August, when this plan, and with it every other\nprospect of escape, was dashed by the sudden death of the old Marquis.\n\nUndine, at first, had supposed that the resulting change could not\nbe other than favourable. She had been on too formal terms with her\nfather-in-law--a remote and ceremonious old gentleman to whom her own\npersonality was evidently an insoluble enigma--to feel more than the\nmerest conventional pang at his death; and it was certainly \"more fun\"\nto be a marchioness than a countess, and to know that one's husband\nwas the head of the house. Besides, now they would have the chateau to\nthemselves--or at least the old Marquise, when she came, would be there\nas a guest and not a ruler--and visions of smart house-parties and big\nshoots lit up the first weeks of Undine's enforced seclusion. Then, by\ndegrees, the inexorable conditions of French mourning closed in on\nher. Immediately after the long-drawn funeral observances the bereaved\nfamily--mother, daughters, sons and sons-in-law--came down to\nseclude themselves at Saint Desert; and Undine, through the slow hot\ncrape-smelling months, lived encircled by shrouded images of woe in\nwhich the only live points were the eyes constantly fixed on her least\nmovements. The hope of escaping to the seaside with Paul vanished in\nthe pained stare with which her mother-in-law received the suggestion.\nUndine learned the next day that it had cost the old Marquise a\nsleepless night, and might have had more distressing results had it not\nbeen explained as a harmless instance of transatlantic oddness. Raymond\nentreated his wife to atone for her involuntary legeret\u00c3\u00a9 by submitting\nwith a good grace to the usages of her adopted country; and he seemed to\nregard the remaining months of the summer as hardly long enough for this\nact of expiation. As Undine looked back on them, they appeared to have\nbeen composed of an interminable succession of identical days, in which\nattendance at early mass (in the coroneted gallery she had once so\nglowingly depicted to Van Degen) was followed by a great deal of\nconversational sitting about, a great deal of excellent eating, an\noccasional drive to the nearest town behind a pair of heavy draft\nhorses, and long evenings in a lamp-heated drawing-room with all the\nwindows shut, and the stout cure making an asthmatic fourth at the\nMarquise's card-table.\n\nStill, even these conditions were not permanent, and the discipline\nof the last years had trained Undine to wait and dissemble. The summer\nover, it was decided--after a protracted family conclave--that the state\nof the old Marquise's health made it advisable for her to spend the\nwinter with the married daughter who lived near Pau. The other members\nof the family returned to their respective estates, and Undine once more\nfound herself alone with her husband. But she knew by this time that\nthere was to be no thought of Paris that winter, or even the next\nspring. Worse still, she was presently to discover that Raymond's\naccession of rank brought with it no financial advantages.\n\nHaving but the vaguest notion of French testamentary law, she was\ndismayed to learn that the compulsory division of property made it\nimpossible for a father to benefit his eldest son at the expense of the\nothers. Raymond was therefore little richer than before, and with the\ndebts of honour of a troublesome younger brother to settle, and Saint\nDesert to keep up, his available income was actually reduced. He held\nout, indeed, the hope of eventual improvement, since the old Marquis had\nmanaged his estates with a lofty contempt for modern methods, and the\napplication of new principles of agriculture and forestry were certain\nto yield profitable results. But for a year or two, at any rate,\nthis very change of treatment would necessitate the owner's continual\nsupervision, and would not in the meanwhile produce any increase of\nincome.\n\nTo faire valoir the family acres had always, it appeared, been Raymond's\ndeepest-seated purpose, and all his frivolities dropped from him with\nthe prospect of putting his hand to the plough. He was not, indeed,\ninhuman enough to condemn his wife to perpetual exile. He meant, he\nassured her, that she should have her annual spring visit to Paris--but\nhe stared in dismay at her suggestion that they should take possession\nof the coveted premier of the Hotel de Chelles. He was gallant enough to\nexpress the wish that it were in his power to house her on such a\nscale; but he could not conceal his surprise that she had ever seriously\nexpected it. She was beginning to see that he felt her constitutional\ninability to understand anything about money as the deepest difference\nbetween them. It was a proficiency no one had ever expected her to\nacquire, and the lack of which she had even been encouraged to regard as\na grace and to use as a pretext. During the interval between her divorce\nand her remarriage she had learned what things cost, but not how to do\nwithout them; and money still seemed to her like some mysterious and\nuncertain stream which occasionally vanished underground but was sure\nto bubble up again at one's feet. Now, however, she found herself in a\nworld where it represented not the means of individual gratification but\nthe substance binding together whole groups of interests, and where the\nuses to which it might be put in twenty years were considered before\nthe reasons for spending it on the spot. At first she was sure she could\nlaugh Raymond out of his prudence or coax him round to her point of\nview. She did not understand how a man so romantically in love could be\nso unpersuadable on certain points. Hitherto she had had to contend\nwith personal moods, now she was arguing against a policy; and she was\ngradually to learn that it was as natural to Raymond de Chelles to adore\nher and resist her as it had been to Ralph Marvell to adore her and let\nher have her way. At first, indeed, he appealed to her good sense, using\narguments evidently drawn from accumulations of hereditary experience.\nBut his economic plea was as unintelligible to her as the silly problems\nabout pen-knives and apples in the \"Mental Arithmetic\" of her infancy;\nand when he struck a tenderer note and spoke of the duty of providing\nfor the son he hoped for, she put her arms about him to whisper: \"But\nthen I oughtn't to be worried...\"\n\nAfter that, she noticed, though he was as charming as ever, he behaved\nas if the case were closed. He had apparently decided that his arguments\nwere unintelligible to her, and under all his ardour she felt the\ndifference made by the discovery. It did not make him less kind, but it\nevidently made her less important; and she had the half-frightened sense\nthat the day she ceased to please him she would cease to exist for him.\nThat day was a long way off, of course, but the chill of it had brushed\nher face; and she was no longer heedless of such signs. She resolved to\ncultivate all the arts of patience and compliance, and habit might have\nhelped them to take root if they had not been nipped by a new cataclysm.\n\nIt was barely a week ago that her husband had been called to Paris to\nstraighten out a fresh tangle in the affairs of the troublesome brother\nwhose difficulties were apparently a part of the family tradition.\nRaymond's letters had been hurried, his telegrams brief and\ncontradictory, and now, as Undine stood watching for the brougham that\nwas to bring him from the station, she had the sense that with his\narrival all her vague fears would be confirmed. There would be more\nmoney to pay out, of course--since the funds that could not be found\nfor her just needs were apparently always forthcoming to settle Hubert's\nscandalous prodigalities--and that meant a longer perspective of\nsolitude at Saint Desert, and a fresh pretext for postponing the\nhospitalities that were to follow on their period of mourning. The\nbrougham--a vehicle as massive and lumbering as the pair that drew\nit--presently rolled into the court, and Raymond's sable figure (she\nhad never before seen a man travel in such black clothes) sprang up the\nsteps to the door. Whenever Undine saw him after an absence she had\na curious sense of his coming back from unknown distances and not\nbelonging to her or to any state of things she understood. Then habit\nreasserted itself, and she began to think of him again with a querulous\nfamiliarity. But she had learned to hide her feelings, and as he came in\nshe put up her face for a kiss.\n\n\"Yes--everything's settled--\" his embrace expressed the satisfaction of\nthe man returning from an accomplished task to the joys of his fireside.\n\n\"Settled?\" Her face kindled. \"Without your having to pay?\"\n\nHe looked at her with a shrug. \"Of course I've had to pay. Did you\nsuppose Hubert's creditors would be put off with vanilla eclairs?\"\n\n\"Oh, if THAT'S what you mean--if Hubert has only to wire you at any time\nto be sure of his affairs being settled--!\"\n\nShe saw his lips narrow and a line come out between his eyes. \"Wouldn't\nit be a happy thought to tell them to bring tea?\" he suggested.\n\n\"In the library, then. It's so cold here--and the tapestries smell so of\nrain.\"\n\nHe paused a moment to scrutinize the long walls, on which the fabulous\nblues and pinks of the great Boucher series looked as livid as withered\nroses. \"I suppose they ought to be taken down and aired,\" he said.\n\nShe thought: \"In THIS air--much good it would do them!\" But she had\nalready repented her outbreak about Hubert, and she followed her husband\ninto the library with the resolve not to let him see her annoyance.\nCompared with the long grey gallery the library, with its brown walls\nof books, looked warm and home-like, and Raymond seemed to feel the\ninfluence of the softer atmosphere. He turned to his wife and put his\narm about her.\n\n\"I know it's been a trial to you, dearest; but this is the last time I\nshall have to pull the poor boy out.\"\n\nIn spite of herself she laughed incredulously: Hubert's \"last times\"\nwere a household word.\n\nBut when tea had been brought, and they were alone over the fire,\nRaymond unfolded the amazing sequel. Hubert had found an heiress, Hubert\nwas to be married, and henceforth the business of paying his debts\n(which might be counted on to recur as inevitably as the changes of the\nseasons) would devolve on his American bride--the charming Miss Looty\nArlington, whom Raymond had remained over in Paris to meet.\n\n\"An American? He's marrying an American?\" Undine wavered between wrath\nand satisfaction. She felt a flash of resentment at any other intruder's\nventuring upon her territory--(\"Looty Arlington? Who is she? What a\nname!\")--but it was quickly superseded by the relief of knowing that\nhenceforth, as Raymond said, Hubert's debts would be some one else's\nbusiness. Then a third consideration prevailed. \"But if he's engaged to\na rich girl, why on earth do WE have to pull him out?\"\n\nHer husband explained that no other course was possible. Though General\nArlington was immensely wealthy, (\"her father's a general--a General\nManager, whatever that may be,\") he had exacted what he called \"a clean\nslate\" from his future son-in-law, and Hubert's creditors (the boy was\nsuch a donkey!) had in their possession certain papers that made it\npossible for them to press for immediate payment.\n\n\"Your compatriots' views on such matters are so rigid--and it's all to\ntheir credit--that the marriage would have fallen through at once if the\nleast hint of Hubert's mess had got out--and then we should have had him\non our hands for life.\"\n\nYes--from that point of view it was doubtless best to pay up; but Undine\nobscurely wished that their doing so had not incidentally helped an\nunknown compatriot to what the American papers were no doubt already\nannouncing as \"another brilliant foreign alliance.\"\n\n\"Where on earth did your brother pick up anybody respectable? Do you\nknow where her people come from? I suppose she's perfectly awful,\" she\nbroke out with a sudden escape of irritation.\n\n\"I believe Hubert made her acquaintance at a skating rink. They come\nfrom some new state--the general apologized for its not yet being on the\nmap, but seemed surprised I hadn't heard of it. He said it was already\nknown as one of 'the divorce states,' and the principal city had, in\nconsequence, a very agreeable society. La petite n'est vraiment pas trop\nmal.\"\n\n\"I daresay not! We're all good-looking. But she must be horribly\ncommon.\"\n\nRaymond seemed sincerely unable to formulate a judgment. \"My dear, you\nhave your own customs...\"\n\n\"Oh, I know we're all alike to you!\" It was one of her grievances\nthat he never attempted to discriminate between Americans. \"You see no\ndifference between me and a girl one gets engaged to at a skating rink!\"\n\nHe evaded the challenge by rejoining: \"Miss Arlington's burning to know\nyou. She says she's heard a great deal about you, and Hubert wants to\nbring her down next week. I think we'd better do what we can.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" But Undine was still absorbed in the economic aspect of the\ncase. \"If they're as rich as you say, I suppose Hubert means to pay you\nback by and bye?\"\n\n\"Naturally. It's all arranged. He's given me a paper.\" He drew her hands\ninto his. \"You see we've every reason to be kind to Miss Arlington.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'll be as kind as you like!\" She brightened at the prospect of\nrepayment. Yes, they would ask the girl down... She leaned a little\nnearer to her husband. \"But then after a while we shall be a good deal\nbetter off--especially, as you say, with no more of Hubert's debts to\nworry us.\" And leaning back far enough to give her upward smile, she\nrenewed her plea for the premier in the Hotel de Chelles: \"Because,\nreally, you know, as the head of the house you ought to--\"\n\n\"Ah, my dear, as the head of the house I've so many obligations; and one\nof them is not to miss a good stroke of business when it comes my way.\"\n\nHer hands slipped from his shoulders and she drew back. \"What do you\nmean by a good stroke of business?\n\n\"Why, an incredible piece of luck--it's what kept me on so long in\nParis. Miss Arlington's father was looking for an apartment for the\nyoung couple, and I've let him the premier for twelve years on the\nunderstanding that he puts electric light and heating into the whole\nhotel. It's a wonderful chance, for of course we all benefit by it as\nmuch as Hubert.\"\n\n\"A wonderful chance... benefit by it as much as Hubert!\" He seemed to be\nspeaking a strange language in which familiar-sounding syllables meant\nsomething totally unknown. Did he really think she was going to\ncoop herself up again in their cramped quarters while Hubert and his\nskating-rink bride luxuriated overhead in the coveted premier? All the\nresentments that had been accumulating in her during the long baffled\nmonths since her marriage broke into speech. \"It's extraordinary of you\nto do such a thing without consulting me!\"\n\n\"Without consulting you? But, my dear child, you've always professed the\nmost complete indifference to business matters--you've frequently begged\nme not to bore you with them. You may be sure I've acted on the best\nadvice; and my mother, whose head is as good as a man's, thinks I've\nmade a remarkably good arrangement.\"\n\n\"I daresay--but I'm not always thinking about money, as you are.\"\n\nAs she spoke she had an ominous sense of impending peril; but she was\ntoo angry to avoid even the risks she saw. To her surprise Raymond put\nhis arm about her with a smile. \"There are many reasons why I have to\nthink about money. One is that YOU don't; and another is that I must\nlook out for the future of our son.\"\n\nUndine flushed to the forehead. She had grown accustomed to such\nallusions and the thought of having a child no longer filled her with\nthe resentful terror she had felt before Paul's birth. She had been\ninsensibly influenced by a different point of view, perhaps also by a\ndifference in her own feeling; and the vision of herself as the mother\nof the future Marquis de Chelles was softened to happiness by the\nthought of giving Raymond a son. But all these lightly-rooted sentiments\nwent down in the rush of her resentment, and she freed herself with a\npetulant movement. \"Oh, my dear, you'd better leave it to your brother\nto perpetuate the race. There'll be more room for nurseries in their\napartment!\"\n\nShe waited a moment, quivering with the expectation of her husband's\nanswer; then, as none came except the silent darkening of his face, she\nwalked to the door and turned round to fling back: \"Of course you can do\nwhat you like with your own house, and make any arrangements that suit\nyour family, without consulting me; but you needn't think I'm ever\ngoing back to live in that stuffy little hole, with Hubert and his wife\nsplurging round on top of our heads!\"\n\n\"Ah--\" said Raymond de Chelles in a low voice.\n\n\n\nXXXIX\n\nUndine did not fulfil her threat. The month of May saw her back in the\nrooms she had declared she would never set foot in, and after her long\nsojourn among the echoing vistas of Saint Desert the exiguity of her\nParis quarters seemed like cosiness.\n\nIn the interval many things had happened. Hubert, permitted by his\nanxious relatives to anticipate the term of the family mourning, had\nbeen showily and expensively united to his heiress; the Hotel de Chelles\nhad been piped, heated and illuminated in accordance with the bride's\nrequirements; and the young couple, not content with these utilitarian\nchanges had moved doors, opened windows, torn down partitions, and\ngiven over the great trophied and pilastered dining-room to a decorative\npainter with a new theory of the human anatomy. Undine had silently\nassisted at this spectacle, and at the sight of the old Marquise's\nabject acquiescence; she had seen the Duchesse de Dordogne and the\nPrincesse Estradina go past her door to visit Hubert's premier and\nmarvel at the American bath-tubs and the Annamite bric-a-brac; and she\nhad been present, with her husband, at the banquet at which Hubert had\nrevealed to the astonished Faubourg the prehistoric episodes depicted on\nhis dining-room walls. She had accepted all these necessities with the\nstoicism which the last months had developed in her; for more and more,\nas the days passed, she felt herself in the grasp of circumstances\nstronger than any effort she could oppose to them. The very absence\nof external pressure, of any tactless assertion of authority on her\nhusband's part, intensified the sense of her helplessness. He simply\nleft it to her to infer that, important as she might be to him in\ncertain ways, there were others in which she did not weigh a feather.\n\nTheir outward relations had not changed since her outburst on the\nsubject of Hubert's marriage. That incident had left her half-ashamed,\nhalf-frightened at her behaviour, and she had tried to atone for it\nby the indirect arts that were her nearest approach to acknowledging\nherself in the wrong. Raymond met her advances with a good grace,\nand they lived through the rest of the winter on terms of apparent\nunderstanding. When the spring approached it was he who suggested that,\nsince his mother had consented to Hubert's marrying before the year of\nmourning was over, there was really no reason why they should not go up\nto Paris as usual; and she was surprised at the readiness with which he\nprepared to accompany her.\n\nA year earlier she would have regarded this as another proof of her\npower; but she now drew her inferences less quickly. Raymond was as\n\"lovely\" to her as ever; but more than once, during their months in the\ncountry, she had had a startled sense of not giving him all he expected\nof her. She had admired him, before their marriage, as a model of social\ndistinction; during the honeymoon he had been the most ardent of lovers;\nand with their settling down at Saint Desert she had prepared to resign\nherself to the society of a country gentleman absorbed in sport and\nagriculture. But Raymond, to her surprise, had again developed a\ndisturbing resemblance to his predecessor. During the long winter\nafternoons, after he had gone over his accounts with the bailiff, or\nwritten his business letters, he took to dabbling with a paint-box, or\npicking out new scores at the piano; after dinner, when they went to the\nlibrary, he seemed to expect to read aloud to her from the reviews and\npapers he was always receiving; and when he had discovered her inability\nto fix her attention he fell into the way of absorbing himself in one of\nthe old brown books with which the room was lined. At first he tried--as\nRalph had done--to tell her about what he was reading or what was\nhappening in the world; but her sense of inadequacy made her slip\naway to other subjects, and little by little their talk died down to\nmonosyllables. Was it possible that, in spite of his books, the evenings\nseemed as long to Raymond as to her, and that he had suggested going\nback to Paris because he was bored at Saint Desert? Bored as she was\nherself, she resented his not finding her company all-sufficient, and\nwas mortified by the discovery that there were regions of his life she\ncould not enter.\n\nBut once back in Paris she had less time for introspection, and Raymond\nless for books. They resumed their dispersed and busy life, and in spite\nof Hubert's ostentatious vicinity, of the perpetual lack of money, and\nof Paul's innocent encroachments on her freedom, Undine, once more in\nher element, ceased to brood upon her grievances. She enjoyed going\nabout with her husband, whose presence at her side was distinctly\nornamental. He seemed to have grown suddenly younger and more animated,\nand when she saw other women looking at him she remembered how\ndistinguished he was. It amused her to have him in her train, and\ndriving about with him to dinners and dances, waiting for him on\nflower-decked landings, or pushing at his side through blazing\ntheatre-lobbies, answered to her inmost ideal of domestic intimacy.\n\nHe seemed disposed to allow her more liberty than before, and it was\nonly now and then that he let drop a brief reminder of the conditions on\nwhich it was accorded. She was to keep certain people at a distance,\nshe was not to cheapen herself by being seen at vulgar restaurants\nand tea-rooms, she was to join with him in fulfilling certain family\nobligations (going to a good many dull dinners among the number); but in\nother respects she was free to fill her days as she pleased.\n\n\"Not that it leaves me much time,\" she admitted to Madame de Trezac;\n\"what with going to see his mother every day, and never missing one of\nhis sisters' jours, and showing myself at the Hotel de Dordogne whenever\nthe Duchess gives a pay-up party to the stuffy people Lili Estradina\nwon't be bothered with, there are days when I never lay eyes on Paul,\nand barely have time to be waved and manicured; but, apart from that,\nRaymond's really much nicer and less fussy than he was.\"\n\nUndine, as she grew older, had developed her mother's craving for a\nconfidante, and Madame de Trezac had succeeded in that capacity to Mabel\nLipscomb and Bertha Shallum.\n\n\"Less fussy?\" Madame de Trezac's long nose lengthened thoughtfully.\n\"H'm--are you sure that's a good sign?\"\n\nUndine stared and laughed. \"Oh, my dear, you're so quaint! Why, nobody's\njealous any more.\"\n\n\"No; that's the worst of it.\" Madame de Trezac pondered. \"It's a\nthousand pities you haven't got a son.\"\n\n\"Yes; I wish we had.\" Undine stood up, impatient to end the\nconversation. Since she had learned that her continued childlessness\nwas regarded by every one about her as not only unfortunate but somehow\nvaguely derogatory to her, she had genuinely begun to regret it; and any\nallusion to the subject disturbed her.\n\n\"Especially,\" Madame de Trezac continued, \"as Hubert's wife--\"\n\n\"Oh, if THAT'S all they want, it's a pity Raymond didn't marry Hubert's\nwife,\" Undine flung back; and on the stairs she murmured to herself:\n\"Nettie has been talking to my mother-in-law.\"\n\nBut this explanation did not quiet her, and that evening, as she and\nRaymond drove back together from a party, she felt a sudden impulse to\nspeak. Sitting close to him in the darkness of the carriage, it ought to\nhave been easy for her to find the needed word; but the barrier of his\nindifference hung between them, and street after street slipped by,\nand the spangled blackness of the river unrolled itself beneath their\nwheels, before she leaned over to touch his hand.\n\n\"What is it, my dear?\"\n\nShe had not yet found the word, and already his tone told her she was\ntoo late. A year ago, if she had slipped her hand in his, she would not\nhave had that answer.\n\n\"Your mother blames me for our not having a child. Everybody thinks it's\nmy fault.\"\n\nHe paused before answering, and she sat watching his shadowy profile\nagainst the passing lamps.\n\n\"My mother's ideas are old-fashioned; and I don't know that it's\nanybody's business but yours and mine.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"Here we are.\" The brougham was turning under the archway of the hotel,\nand the light of Hubert's tall windows fell across the dusky court.\nRaymond helped her out, and they mounted to their door by the stairs\nwhich Hubert had recarpeted in velvet, with a marble nymph lurking in\nthe azaleas on the landing.\n\nIn the antechamber Raymond paused to take her cloak from her shoulders,\nand his eyes rested on her with a faint smile of approval.\n\n\"You never looked better; your dress is extremely becoming. Good-night,\nmy dear,\" he said, kissing her hand as he turned away.\n\nUndine kept this incident to herself: her wounded pride made her shrink\nfrom confessing it even to Madame de Trezac. She was sure Raymond would\n\"come back\"; Ralph always had, to the last. During their remaining weeks\nin Paris she reassured herself with the thought that once they were back\nat Saint Desert she would easily regain her lost hold; and when Raymond\nsuggested their leaving Paris she acquiesced without a protest. But at\nSaint Desert she seemed no nearer to him than in Paris. He continued to\ntreat her with unvarying amiability, but he seemed wholly absorbed in\nthe management of the estate, in his books, his sketching and his music.\nHe had begun to interest himself in politics and had been urged to stand\nfor his department. This necessitated frequent displacements: trips to\nBeaune or Dijon and occasional absences in Paris. Undine, when he was\naway, was not left alone, for the dowager Marquise had established\nherself at Saint Desert for the summer, and relays of brothers\nand sisters-in-law, aunts, cousins and ecclesiastical friends and\nconnections succeeded each other under its capacious roof. Only Hubert\nand his wife were absent. They had taken a villa at Deauville, and in\nthe morning papers Undine followed the chronicle of Hubert's polo scores\nand of the Countess Hubert's racing toilets.\n\nThe days crawled on with a benumbing sameness. The old Marquise and the\nother ladies of the party sat on the terrace with their needle-work, the\ncure or one of the visiting uncles read aloud the Journal des Debats and\nprognosticated dark things of the Republic, Paul scoured the park and\ndespoiled the kitchen-garden with the other children of the family,\nthe inhabitants of the adjacent chateaux drove over to call, and\noccasionally the ponderous pair were harnessed to a landau as lumbering\nas the brougham, and the ladies of Saint Desert measured the dusty\nkilometres between themselves and their neighbours.\n\nIt was the first time that Undine had seriously paused to consider\nthe conditions of her new life, and as the days passed she began to\nunderstand that so they would continue to succeed each other till the\nend. Every one about her took it for granted that as long as she\nlived she would spend ten months of every year at Saint Desert and the\nremaining two in Paris. Of course, if health required it, she might go\nto les eaux with her husband; but the old Marquise was very doubtful\nas to the benefit of a course of waters, and her uncle the Duke and her\ncousin the Canon shared her view. In the case of young married women,\nespecially, the unwholesome excitement of the modern watering-place was\nmore than likely to do away with the possible benefit of the treatment.\nAs to travel--had not Raymond and his wife been to Egypt and Asia Minor\non their wedding-journey? Such reckless enterprise was unheard of in the\nannals of the house! Had they not spent days and days in the saddle, and\nslept in tents among the Arabs? (Who could tell, indeed, whether these\nimprudences were not the cause of the disappointment which it had\npleased heaven to inflict on the young couple?) No one in the family\nhad ever taken so long a wedding-journey. One bride had gone to\nEngland (even that was considered extreme), and another--the artistic\ndaughter--had spent a week in Venice; which certainly showed that they\nwere not behind the times, and had no old-fashioned prejudices. Since\nwedding-journeys were the fashion, they had taken them; but who had ever\nheard of travelling afterward?\n\nWhat could be the possible object of leaving one's family, one's habits,\none's friends? It was natural that the Americans, who had no homes, who\nwere born and died in hotels, should have contracted nomadic habits: but\nthe new Marquise de Chelles was no longer an American, and she had Saint\nDesert and the Hotel de Chelles to live in, as generations of ladies of\nher name had done before her. Thus Undine beheld her future laid out for\nher, not directly and in blunt words, but obliquely and affably, in the\nallusions, the assumptions, the insinuations of the amiable women among\nwhom her days were spent. Their interminable conversations were carried\non to the click of knitting-needles and the rise and fall of industrious\nfingers above embroidery-frames; and as Undine sat staring at the\nlustrous nails of her idle hands she felt that her inability to occupy\nthem was regarded as one of the chief causes of her restlessness. The\ninnumerable rooms of Saint Desert were furnished with the embroidered\nhangings and tapestry chairs produced by generations of diligent\nchatelaines, and the untiring needles of the old Marquise, her daughters\nand dependents were still steadily increasing the provision.\n\nIt struck Undine as curious that they should be willing to go on making\nchair-coverings and bed-curtains for a house that didn't really belong\nto them, and that she had a right to pull about and rearrange as she\nchose; but then that was only a part of their whole incomprehensible way\nof regarding themselves (in spite of their acute personal and parochial\nabsorptions) as minor members of a powerful and indivisible whole, the\nhuge voracious fetish they called The Family.\n\nNotwithstanding their very definite theories as to what Americans were\nand were not, they were evidently bewildered at finding no corresponding\nsense of solidarity in Undine; and little Paul's rootlessness, his lack\nof all local and linear ties, made them (for all the charm he exercised)\nregard him with something of the shyness of pious Christians toward\nan elfin child. But though mother and child gave them a sense of\ninsuperable strangeness, it plainly never occurred to them that both\nwould not be gradually subdued to the customs of Saint Desert. Dynasties\nhad fallen, institutions changed, manners and morals, alas, deplorably\ndeclined; but as far back as memory went, the ladies of the line of\nChelles had always sat at their needle-work on the terrace of Saint\nDesert, while the men of the house lamented the corruption of the\ngovernment and the cure ascribed the unhappy state of the country to the\ndecline of religious feeling and the rise in the cost of living. It was\ninevitable that, in the course of time, the new Marquise should come to\nunderstand the fundamental necessity of these things being as they were;\nand meanwhile the forbearance of her husband's family exercised itself,\nwith the smiling discretion of their race, through the long succession\nof uneventful days.\n\nOnce, in September, this routine was broken in upon by the unannounced\ndescent of a flock of motors bearing the Princess Estradina and a chosen\nband from one watering-place to another. Raymond was away at the time,\nbut family loyalty constrained the old Marquise to welcome her kinswoman\nand the latter's friends; and Undine once more found herself immersed in\nthe world from which her marriage had removed her.\n\nThe Princess, at first, seemed totally to have forgotten their former\nintimacy, and Undine was made to feel that in a life so variously\nagitated the episode could hardly have left a trace. But the night\nbefore her departure the incalculable Lili, with one of her sudden\nchanges of humour, drew her former friend into her bedroom and plunged\ninto an exchange of confidences. She naturally unfolded her own history\nfirst, and it was so packed with incident that the courtyard clock had\nstruck two before she turned her attention to Undine.\n\n\"My dear, you're handsomer than ever; only perhaps a shade too stout.\nDomestic bliss, I suppose? Take care! You need an emotion, a drama...\nYou Americans are really extraordinary. You appear to live on change and\nexcitement; and then suddenly a man comes along and claps a ring on your\nfinger, and you never look through it to see what's going on outside.\nAren't you ever the least bit bored? Why do I never see anything of you\nany more? I suppose it's the fault of my venerable aunt--she's never\nforgiven me for having a better time than her daughters. How can I help\nit if I don't look like the cure's umbrella? I daresay she owes you the\nsame grudge. But why do you let her coop you up here? It's a thousand\npities you haven't had a child. They'd all treat you differently if you\nhad.\"\n\nIt was the same perpetually reiterated condolence; and Undine flushed\nwith anger as she listened. Why indeed had she let herself be cooped up?\nShe could not have answered the Princess's question: she merely felt\nthe impossibility of breaking through the mysterious web of traditions,\nconventions, prohibitions that enclosed her in their impenetrable\nnet-work. But her vanity suggested the obvious pretext, and she murmured\nwith a laugh: \"I didn't know Raymond was going to be so jealous--\"\n\nThe Princess stared. \"Is it Raymond who keeps you shut up here? And what\nabout his trips to Dijon? And what do you suppose he does with himself\nwhen he runs up to Paris? Politics?\" She shrugged ironically. \"Politics\ndon't occupy a man after midnight. Raymond jealous of you? Ah, merci!\nMy dear, it's what I always say when people talk to me about fast\nAmericans: you're the only innocent women left in the world...\"\n\n\n\nXL\n\nAfter the Princess Estradina's departure, the days at Saint Desert\nsucceeded each other indistinguishably; and more and more, as they\npassed, Undine felt herself drawn into the slow strong current already\nfed by so many tributary lives. Some spell she could not have named\nseemed to emanate from the old house which had so long been the\ncustodian of an unbroken tradition: things had happened there in the\nsame way for so many generations that to try to alter them seemed as\nvain as to contend with the elements.\n\nWinter came and went, and once more the calendar marked the first days\nof spring; but though the horse-chestnuts of the Champs Elysees were\nbudding snow still lingered in the grass drives of Saint Desert and\nalong the ridges of the hills beyond the park. Sometimes, as Undine\nlooked out of the windows of the Boucher gallery, she felt as if her\neyes had never rested on any other scene. Even her occasional brief\ntrips to Paris left no lasting trace: the life of the vivid streets\nfaded to a shadow as soon as the black and white horizon of Saint Desert\nclosed in on her again.\n\nThough the afternoons were still cold she had lately taken to sitting in\nthe gallery. The smiling scenes on its walls and the tall screens which\nbroke its length made it more habitable than the drawing-rooms beyond;\nbut her chief reason for preferring it was the satisfaction she found in\nhaving fires lit in both the monumental chimneys that faced each other\ndown its long perspective. This satisfaction had its source in the old\nMarquise's disapproval. Never before in the history of Saint Desert\nhad the consumption of firewood exceeded a certain carefully-calculated\nmeasure; but since Undine had been in authority this allowance had been\ndoubled. If any one had told her, a year earlier, that one of the chief\ndistractions of her new life would be to invent ways of annoying her\nmother-in-law, she would have laughed at the idea of wasting her time on\nsuch trifles. But she found herself with a great deal of time to waste,\nand with a fierce desire to spend it in upsetting the immemorial customs\nof Saint Desert. Her husband had mastered her in essentials, but she\nhad discovered innumerable small ways of irritating and hurting him, and\none--and not the least effectual--was to do anything that went counter\nto his mother's prejudices. It was not that he always shared her views,\nor was a particularly subservient son; but it seemed to be one of his\nfundamental principles that a man should respect his mother's wishes,\nand see to it that his household respected them. All Frenchmen of\nhis class appeared to share this view, and to regard it as beyond\ndiscussion: it was based on something so much more Immutable than\npersonal feeling that one might even hate one's mother and yet insist\nthat her ideas as to the consumption of fire-wood should be regarded.\n\nThe old Marquise, during the cold weather, always sat in her bedroom;\nand there, between the tapestried four-poster and the fireplace, the\nfamily grouped itself around the ground-glass of her single carcel lamp.\nIn the evening, if there were visitors, a fire was lit in the library;\notherwise the family again sat about the Marquise's lamp till the\nfootman came in at ten with tisane and biscuits de Reims; after which\nevery one bade the dowager good night and scattered down the corridors\nto chill distances marked by tapers floating in cups of oil.\n\nSince Undine's coming the library fire had never been allowed to go\nout; and of late, after experimenting with the two drawing-rooms and the\nso-called \"study\" where Raymond kept his guns and saw the bailiff, she\nhad selected the gallery as the most suitable place for the new and\nunfamiliar ceremony of afternoon tea. Afternoon refreshments had never\nbefore been served at Saint Desert except when company was expected;\nwhen they had invariably consisted in a decanter of sweet port and a\nplate of small dry cakes--the kind that kept. That the complicated rites\nof the tea-urn, with its offering-up of perishable delicacies, should be\nenacted for the sole enjoyment of the family, was a thing so unheard of\nthat for a while Undine found sufficient amusement in elaborating the\nceremonial, and in making the ancestral plate groan under more varied\nviands; and when this palled she devised the plan of performing the\noffice in the gallery and lighting sacrificial fires in both chimneys.\n\nShe had said to Raymond, at first: \"It's ridiculous that your mother\nshould sit in her bedroom all day. She says she does it to save fires;\nbut if we have a fire downstairs why can't she let hers go out, and come\ndown? I don't see why I should spend my life in your mother's bedroom.\"\n\nRaymond made no answer, and the Marquise did, in fact, let her fire go\nout. But she did not come down--she simply continued to sit upstairs\nwithout a fire.\n\nAt first this also amused Undine; then the tacit criticism implied began\nto irritate her. She hoped Raymond would speak of his mother's attitude:\nshe had her answer ready if he did! But he made no comment, he took no\nnotice; her impulses of retaliation spent themselves against the blank\nsurface of his indifference. He was as amiable, as considerate as ever;\nas ready, within reason, to accede to her wishes and gratify her whims.\nOnce or twice, when she suggested running up to Paris to take Paul to\nthe dentist, or to look for a servant, he agreed to the necessity and\nwent up with her. But instead of going to an hotel they went to their\napartment, where carpets were up and curtains down, and a care-taker\nprepared primitive food at uncertain hours; and Undine's first glimpse\nof Hubert's illuminated windows deepened her rancour and her sense of\nhelplessness.\n\nAs Madame de Trezac had predicted, Raymond's vigilance gradually\nrelaxed, and during their excursions to the capital Undine came and went\nas she pleased. But her visits were too short to permit of her falling\nin with the social pace, and when she showed herself among her friends\nshe felt countrified and out-of-place, as if even her clothes had come\nfrom Saint Desert. Nevertheless her dresses were more than ever her\nchief preoccupation: in Paris she spent hours at the dressmaker's, and\nin the country the arrival of a box of new gowns was the chief event\nof the vacant days. But there was more bitterness than joy in the\nunpacking, and the dresses hung in her wardrobe like so many unfulfilled\npromises of pleasure, reminding her of the days at the Stentorian when\nshe had reviewed other finery with the same cheated eyes. In spite of\nthis, she multiplied her orders, writing up to the dress-makers for\npatterns, and to the milliners for boxes of hats which she tried on,\nand kept for days, without being able to make a choice. Now and then she\neven sent her maid up to Paris to bring back great assortments of veils,\ngloves, flowers and laces; and after periods of painful indecision she\nended by keeping the greater number, lest those she sent back should\nturn out to be the ones that were worn in Paris. She knew she was\nspending too much money, and she had lost her youthful faith in\nprovidential solutions; but she had always had the habit of going out to\nbuy something when she was bored, and never had she been in greater need\nof such solace.\n\nThe dulness of her life seemed to have passed into her blood: her\ncomplexion was less animated, her hair less shining. The change in her\nlooks alarmed her, and she scanned the fashion-papers for new scents\nand powders, and experimented in facial bandaging, electric massage and\nother processes of renovation. Odd atavisms woke in her, and she began\nto pore over patent medicine advertisements, to send stamped envelopes\nto beauty doctors and professors of physical development, and to brood\non the advantage of consulting faith-healers, mind-readers and their\nkindred adepts. She even wrote to her mother for the receipts of some of\nher grandfather's forgotten nostrums, and modified her daily life, and\nher hours of sleeping, eating and exercise, in accordance with each new\nexperiment.\n\nHer constitutional restlessness lapsed into an apathy like Mrs.\nSpragg's, and the least demand on her activity irritated her. But she\nwas beset by endless annoyances: bickerings with discontented maids, the\ndifficulty of finding a tutor for Paul, and the problem of keeping him\namused and occupied without having him too much on her hands. A great\nliking had sprung up between Raymond and the little boy, and during the\nsummer Paul was perpetually at his step-father's side in the stables and\nthe park. But with the coming of winter Raymond was oftener away, and\nPaul developed a persistent cold that kept him frequently indoors. The\nconfinement made him fretful and exacting, and the old Marquise ascribed\nthe change in his behaviour to the deplorable influence of his tutor, a\n\"laic\" recommended by one of Raymond's old professors. Raymond himself\nwould have preferred an abb\u00c3\u00a9: it was in the tradition of the house,\nand though Paul was not of the house it seemed fitting that he should\nconform to its ways. Moreover, when the married sisters came to stay\nthey objected to having their children exposed to the tutor's influence,\nand even implied that Paul's society might be contaminating. But Undine,\nthough she had so readily embraced her husband's faith, stubbornly\nresisted the suggestion that she should hand over her son to the Church.\nThe tutor therefore remained; but the friction caused by his presence\nwas so irritating to Undine that she began to consider the alternative\nof sending Paul to school. He was still small and tender for the\nexperiment; but she persuaded herself that what he needed was\n\"hardening,\" and having heard of a school where fashionable infancy\nwas subjected to this process, she entered into correspondence with the\nmaster. His first letter convinced her that his establishment was just\nthe place for Paul; but the second contained the price-list, and after\ncomparing it with the tutor's keep and salary she wrote to say that she\nfeared her little boy was too young to be sent away from home.\n\nHer husband, for some time past, had ceased to make any comment on her\nexpenditure. She knew he thought her too extravagant, and felt sure\nhe was minutely aware of what she spent; for Saint Desert projected on\neconomic details a light as different as might be from the haze that\nveiled them in West End Avenue. She therefore concluded that Raymond's\nsilence was intentional, and ascribed it to his having shortcomings of\nhis own to conceal. The Princess Estradina's pleasantry had reached its\nmark. Undine did not believe that her husband was seriously in love with\nanother woman--she could not conceive that any one could tire of her\nof whom she had not first tired--but she was humiliated by his\nindifference, and it was easier to ascribe it to the arts of a rival\nthan to any deficiency in herself. It exasperated her to think that he\nmight have consolations for the outward monotony of his life, and she\nresolved that when they returned to Paris he should see that she was not\nwithout similar opportunities.\n\nMarch, meanwhile, was verging on April, and still he did not speak of\nleaving. Undine had learned that he expected to have such decisions left\nto him, and she hid her impatience lest her showing it should incline\nhim to delay. But one day, as she sat at tea in the gallery, he came in\nin his riding-clothes and said: \"I've been over to the other side of the\nmountain. The February rains have weakened the dam of the Alette, and\nthe vineyards will be in danger if we don't rebuild at once.\"\n\nShe suppressed a yawn, thinking, as she did so, how dull he always\nlooked when he talked of agriculture. It made him seem years older, and\nshe reflected with a shiver that listening to him probably gave her the\nsame look.\n\nHe went on, as she handed him his tea: \"I'm sorry it should happen\njust now. I'm afraid I shall have to ask you to give up your spring in\nParis.\" \"Oh, no--no!\" she broke out. A throng of half-subdued grievances\nchoked in her: she wanted to burst into sobs like a child.\n\n\"I know it's a disappointment. But our expenses have been unusually\nheavy this year.\"\n\n\"It seems to me they always are. I don't see why we should give up Paris\nbecause you've got to make repairs to a dam. Isn't Hubert ever going to\npay back that money?\"\n\nHe looked at her with a mild surprise. \"But surely you understood at the\ntime that it won't be possible till his wife inherits?\"\n\n\"Till General Arlington dies, you mean? He doesn't look much older than\nyou!\"\n\n\"You may remember that I showed you Hubert's note. He has paid the\ninterest quite regularly.\"\n\n\"That's kind of him!\" She stood up, flaming with rebellion. \"You can do\nas you please; but I mean to go to Paris.\"\n\n\"My mother is not going. I didn't intend to open our apartment.\"\n\n\"I understand. But I shall open it--that's all!\"\n\nHe had risen too, and she saw his face whiten. \"I prefer that you\nshouldn't go without me.\"\n\n\"Then I shall go and stay at the Nouveau Luxe with my American friends.\"\n\n\"That never!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I consider it unsuitable.\"\n\n\"Your considering it so doesn't prove it.\"\n\nThey stood facing each other, quivering with an equal anger; then he\ncontrolled himself and said in a more conciliatory tone: \"You never seem\nto see that there are necessities--\"\n\n\"Oh, neither do you--that's the trouble. You can't keep me shut up here\nall my life, and interfere with everything I want to do, just by saying\nit's unsuitable.\"\n\n\"I've never interfered with your spending your money as you please.\"\n\nIt was her turn to stare, sincerely wondering. \"Mercy, I should hope\nnot, when you've always grudged me every penny of yours!\"\n\n\"You know it's not because I grudge it. I would gladly take you to Paris\nif I had the money.\"\n\n\"You can always find the money to spend on this place. Why don't you\nsell it if it's so fearfully expensive?\"\n\n\"Sell it? Sell Saint Desert?\"\n\nThe suggestion seemed to strike him as something monstrously, almost\nfiendishly significant: as if her random word had at last thrust\ninto his hand the clue to their whole unhappy difference. Without\nunderstanding this, she guessed it from the change in his face: it was\nas if a deadly solvent had suddenly decomposed its familiar lines.\n\n\"Well, why not?\" His horror spurred her on. \"You might sell some of the\nthings in it anyhow. In America we're not ashamed to sell what we can't\nafford to keep.\" Her eyes fell on the storied hangings at his back.\n\"Why, there's a fortune in this one room: you could get anything you\nchose for those tapestries. And you stand here and tell me you're a\npauper!\"\n\nHis glance followed hers to the tapestries, and then returned to her\nface. \"Ah, you don't understand,\" he said.\n\n\"I understand that you care for all this old stuff more than you do for\nme, and that you'd rather see me unhappy and miserable than touch one of\nyour great-grandfather's arm-chairs.\"\n\nThe colour came slowly back to his face, but it hardened into lines she\nhad never seen. He looked at her as though the place where she stood\nwere empty. \"You don't understand,\" he said again.\n\n\n\nXLI\n\nThe incident left Undine with the baffled feeling of not being able to\ncount on any of her old weapons of aggression. In all her struggles for\nauthority her sense of the rightfulness of her cause had been measured\nby her power of making people do as she pleased. Raymond's firmness\nshook her faith in her own claims, and a blind desire to wound and\ndestroy replaced her usual business-like intentness on gaining her\nend. But her ironies were as ineffectual as her arguments, and his\nimperviousness was the more exasperating because she divined that some\nof the things she said would have hurt him if any one else had said\nthem: it was the fact of their coming from her that made them innocuous.\nEven when, at the close of their talk, she had burst out: \"If you grudge\nme everything I care about we'd better separate,\" he had merely answered\nwith a shrug: \"It's one of the things we don't do--\" and the answer had\nbeen like the slamming of an iron door in her face.\n\nAn interval of silent brooding had resulted in a reaction of rebellion.\nShe dared not carry out her threat of joining her compatriots at the\nNouveau Luxe: she had too clear a memory of the results of her former\nrevolt. But neither could she submit to her present fate without\nattempting to make Raymond understand his selfish folly. She had failed\nto prove it by argument, but she had an inherited faith in the value of\npractical demonstration. If he could be made to see how easily he could\ngive her what she wanted perhaps he might come round to her view.\n\nWith this idea in mind, she had gone up to Paris for twenty-four hours,\non the pretext of finding a new nurse for Paul; and the steps then taken\nhad enabled her, on the first occasion, to set her plan in motion. The\noccasion was furnished by Raymond's next trip to Beaune. He went off\nearly one morning, leaving word that he should not be back till night;\nand on the afternoon of the same day she stood at her usual post in the\ngallery, scanning the long perspective of the poplar avenue.\n\nShe had not stood there long before a black speck at the end of the\navenue expanded into a motor that was presently throbbing at the\nentrance. Undine, at its approach, turned from the window, and as she\nmoved down the gallery her glance rested on the great tapestries, with\ntheir ineffable minglings of blue and rose, as complacently as though\nthey had been mirrors reflecting her own image.\n\nShe was still looking at them when the door opened and a servant ushered\nin a small swarthy man who, in spite of his conspicuously London-made\nclothes, had an odd exotic air, as if he had worn rings in his ears or\nleft a bale of spices at the door.\n\nHe bowed to Undine, cast a rapid eye up and down the room, and then,\nwith his back to the windows, stood intensely contemplating the wall\nthat faced them.\n\nUndine's heart was beating excitedly. She knew the old Marquise was\ntaking her afternoon nap in her room, yet each sound in the silent house\nseemed to be that of her heels on the stairs.\n\n\"Ah--\" said the visitor.\n\nHe had begun to pace slowly down the gallery, keeping his face to the\ntapestries, like an actor playing to the footlights.\n\n\"AH--\" he said again.\n\nTo ease the tension of her nerves Undine began: \"They were given by\nLouis the Fifteenth to the Marquis de Chelles who--\"\n\n\"Their history has been published,\" the visitor briefly interposed; and\nshe coloured at her blunder.\n\nThe swarthy stranger, fitting a pair of eye-glasses to a nose that was\nlike an instrument of precision, had begun a closer and more detailed\ninspection of the tapestries. He seemed totally unmindful of her\npresence, and his air of lofty indifference was beginning to make\nher wish she had not sent for him. His manner in Paris had been so\ndifferent!\n\nSuddenly he turned and took off the glasses, which sprang back into a\nfold of his clothing like retracted feelers.\n\n\"Yes.\" He stood and looked at her without seeing her. \"Very well. I have\nbrought down a gentleman.\"\n\n\"A gentleman--?\"\n\n\"The greatest American collector--he buys only the best. He will not be\nlong in Paris, and it was his only chance of coming down.\"\n\nUndine drew herself up. \"I don't understand--I never said the tapestries\nwere for sale.\"\n\n\"Precisely. But this gentleman buys only this that are not for sale.\"\n\nIt sounded dazzling and she wavered. \"I don't know--you were only to put\na price on them--\"\n\n\"Let me see him look at them first; then I'll put a price on them,\" he\nchuckled; and without waiting for her answer he went to the door and\nopened it. The gesture revealed the fur-coated back of a gentleman\nwho stood at the opposite end of the hall examining the bust of a\nseventeenth century field-marshal.\n\nThe dealer addressed the back respectfully. \"Mr. Moffatt!\"\n\nMoffatt, who appeared to be interested in the bust, glanced over his\nshoulder without moving. \"See here--\"\n\nHis glance took in Undine, widened to astonishment and passed into\napostrophe. \"Well, if this ain't the damnedest--!\" He came forward and\ntook her by both hands. \"Why, what on earth are you doing down here?\"\n\nShe laughed and blushed, in a tremor at the odd turn of the adventure.\n\"I live here. Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"Not a word--never thought of asking the party's name.\" He turned\njovially to the bowing dealer. \"Say--I told you those tapestries'd\nhave to be out and outers to make up for the trip; but now I see I was\nmistaken.\"\n\nUndine looked at him curiously. His physical appearance was unchanged:\nhe was as compact and ruddy as ever, with the same astute eyes under the\nsame guileless brow; but his self-confidence had become less aggressive,\nand she had never seen him so gallantly at ease.\n\n\"I didn't know you'd become a great collector.\"\n\n\"The greatest! Didn't he tell you so? I thought that was why I was\nallowed to come.\"\n\nShe hesitated. \"Of course, you know, the tapestries are not for sale--\"\n\n\"That so? I thought that was only his dodge to get me down. Well, I'm\nglad they ain't: it'll give us more time to talk.\"\n\nWatch in hand, the dealer intervened. \"If, nevertheless, you would first\ntake a glance. Our train--\"\n\n\"It ain't mine!\" Moffatt interrupted; \"at least not if there's a later\none.\"\n\nUndine's presence of mind had returned. \"Of course there is,\" she said\ngaily. She led the way back into the gallery, half hoping the dealer\nwould allege a pressing reason for departure. She was excited and\namused at Moffatt's unexpected appearance, but humiliated that he should\nsuspect her of being in financial straits. She never wanted to see\nMoffatt except when she was happy and triumphant.\n\nThe dealer had followed the other two into the gallery, and there was a\nmoment's pause while they all stood silently before the tapestries. \"By\nGeorge!\" Moffatt finally brought out.\n\n\"They're historical, you know: the King gave them to Raymond's\ngreat-great-grandfather. The other day when I was in Paris,\" Undine\nhurried on, \"I asked Mr. Fleischhauer to come down some time and tell\nus what they're worth ... and he seems to have misunderstood ... to have\nthought we meant to sell them.\" She addressed herself more pointedly to\nthe dealer. \"I'm sorry you've had the trip for nothing.\"\n\nMr. Fleischhauer inclined himself eloquently. \"It is not nothing to have\nseen such beauty.\"\n\nMoffatt gave him a humorous look. \"I'd hate to see Mr. Fleischhauer miss\nhis train--\"\n\n\"I shall not miss it: I miss nothing,\" said Mr. Fleischhauer. He bowed\nto Undine and backed toward the door.\n\n\"See here,\" Moffatt called to him as he reached the threshold, \"you let\nthe motor take you to the station, and charge up this trip to me.\"\n\nWhen the door closed he turned to Undine with a laugh. \"Well, this beats\nthe band. I thought of course you were living up in Paris.\"\n\nAgain she felt a twinge of embarrassment. \"Oh, French people--I mean my\nhusband's kind--always spend a part of the year on their estates.\"\n\n\"But not this part, do they? Why, everything's humming up there now.\nI was dining at the Nouveau Luxe last night with the Driscolls and\nShallums and Mrs. Rolliver, and all your old crowd were there whooping\nthings up.\"\n\nThe Driscolls and Shallums and Mrs. Rolliver! How carelessly he reeled\noff their names! One could see from his tone that he was one of them\nand wanted her to know it. And nothing could have given her a completer\nsense of his achievement--of the number of millions he must be worth.\nIt must have come about very recently, yet he was already at ease in his\nnew honours--he had the metropolitan tone. While she examined him with\nthese thoughts in her mind she was aware of his giving her as close a\nscrutiny. \"But I suppose you've got your own crowd now,\" he continued;\n\"you always WERE a lap ahead of me.\" He sent his glance down the lordly\nlength of the room. \"It's sorter funny to see you in this kind of place;\nbut you look it--you always DO look it!\"\n\nShe laughed. \"So do you--I was just thinking it!\" Their eyes met. \"I\nsuppose you must be awfully rich.\"\n\nHe laughed too, holding her eyes. \"Oh, out of sight! The Consolidation\nset me on my feet. I own pretty near the whole of Apex. I came down to\nbuy these tapestries for my private car.\"\n\nThe familiar accent of hyperbole exhilarated her. \"I don't suppose I\ncould stop you if you really wanted them!\"\n\n\"Nobody can stop me now if I want anything.\"\n\nThey were looking at each other with challenge and complicity in their\neyes. His voice, his look, all the loud confident vigorous things he\nembodied and expressed, set her blood beating with curiosity. \"I didn't\nknow you and Rolliver were friends,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh JIM--\" his accent verged on the protective. \"Old Jim's all right.\nHe's in Congress now. I've got to have somebody up in Washington.\" He\nhad thrust his hands in his pockets, and with his head thrown back and\nhis lips shaped to the familiar noiseless whistle, was looking slowly\nand discerningly about him.\n\nPresently his eyes reverted to her face. \"So this is what I helped you\nto get,\" he said. \"I've always meant to run over some day and take a\nlook. What is it they call you--a Marquise?\"\n\nShe paled a little, and then flushed again. \"What made you do it?\" she\nbroke out abruptly. \"I've often wondered.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"What--lend you a hand? Why, my business instinct, I\nsuppose. I saw you were in a tight place that time I ran across you in\nParis--and I hadn't any grudge against you. Fact is, I've never had\nthe time to nurse old scores, and if you neglect 'em they die off like\ngold-fish.\" He was still composedly regarding her. \"It's funny to think\nof your having settled down to this kind of life; I hope you've got what\nyou wanted. This is a great place you live in.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I see a little too much of it. We live here most of the year.\"\nShe had meant to give him the illusion of success, but some underlying\ncommunity of instinct drew the confession from her lips.\n\n\"That so? Why on earth don't you cut it and come up to Paris?\"\n\n\"Oh, Raymond's absorbed in the estates--and we haven't got the money.\nThis place eats it all up.\"\n\n\"Well, that sounds aristocratic; but ain't it rather out of date? When\nthe swells are hard-up nowadays they generally chip off an heirloom.\"\nHe wheeled round again to the tapestries. \"There are a good many Paris\nseasons hanging right here on this wall.\"\n\n\"Yes--I know.\" She tried to check herself, to summon up a glittering\nequivocation; but his face, his voice, the very words he used, were like\nso many hammer-strokes demolishing the unrealities that imprisoned her.\nHere was some one who spoke her language, who knew her meanings,\nwho understood instinctively all the deep-seated wants for which her\nacquired vocabulary had no terms; and as she talked she once more seemed\nto herself intelligent, eloquent and interesting.\n\n\"Of course it's frightfully lonely down here,\" she began; and through\nthe opening made by the admission the whole flood of her grievances\npoured forth. She tried to let him see that she had not sacrificed\nherself for nothing; she touched on the superiorities of her situation,\nshe gilded the circumstances of which she called herself the victim, and\nlet titles, offices and attributes shed their utmost lustre on her tale;\nbut what she had to boast of seemed small and tinkling compared with the\nevidences of his power.\n\n\"Well, it's a downright shame you don't go round more,\" he kept saying;\nand she felt ashamed of her tame acceptance of her fate.\n\nWhen she had told her story she asked for his; and for the first time\nshe listened to it with interest. He had what he wanted at last. The\nApex Consolidation scheme, after a long interval of suspense, had\nobtained its charter and shot out huge ramifications. Rolliver had\n\"stood in\" with him at the critical moment, and between them they had\n\"chucked out\" old Harmon B. Driscoll bag and baggage, and got the\nwhole town in their control. Absorbed in his theme, and forgetting her\ninability to follow him, Moffatt launched out on an epic recital of plot\nand counterplot, and she hung, a new Desdemona, on his conflict with\nthe new anthropophagi. It was of no consequence that the details and the\ntechnicalities escaped her: she knew their meaningless syllables stood\nfor success, and what that meant was as clear as day to her. Every Wall\nStreet term had its equivalent in the language of Fifth Avenue, and\nwhile he talked of building up railways she was building up palaces, and\npicturing all the multiple lives he would lead in them. To have things\nhad always seemed to her the first essential of existence, and as she\nlistened to him the vision of the things he could have unrolled itself\nbefore her like the long triumph of an Asiatic conqueror.\n\n\"And what are you going to do next?\" she asked, almost breathlessly,\nwhen he had ended.\n\n\"Oh, there's always a lot to do next. Business never goes to sleep.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I mean besides business.\"\n\n\"Why--everything I can, I guess.\" He leaned back in his chair with an\nair of placid power, as if he were so sure of getting what he wanted\nthat there was no longer any use in hurrying, huge as his vistas had\nbecome.\n\nShe continued to question him, and he began to talk of his growing\npassion for pictures and furniture, and of his desire to form a\ncollection which should be a great representative assemblage of\nunmatched specimens. As he spoke she saw his expression change, and his\neyes grow younger, almost boyish, with a concentrated look in them that\nreminded her of long-forgotten things.\n\n\"I mean to have the best, you know; not just to get ahead of the other\nfellows, but because I know it when I see it. I guess that's the only\ngood reason,\" he concluded; and he added, looking at her with a smile:\n\"It was what you were always after, wasn't it?\"\n\n\n\nXLII\n\nUndine had gained her point, and the entresol of the Hotel de Chelles\nreopened its doors for the season.\n\nHubert and his wife, in expectation of the birth of an heir, had\nwithdrawn to the sumptuous chateau which General Arlington had hired for\nthem near Compiegne, and Undine was at least spared the sight of their\nbright windows and animated stairway. But she had to take her share of\nthe felicitations which the whole far-reaching circle of friends and\nrelations distributed to every member of Hubert's family on the approach\nof the happy event. Nor was this the hardest of her trials. Raymond had\ndone what she asked--he had stood out against his mother's protests, set\naside considerations of prudence, and consented to go up to Paris for\ntwo months; but he had done so on the understanding that during their\nstay they should exercise the most unremitting economy. As dinner-giving\nput the heaviest strain on their budget, all hospitality was suspended;\nand when Undine attempted to invite a few friends informally she was\nwarned that she could not do so without causing the gravest offense to\nthe many others genealogically entitled to the same attention.\n\nRaymond's insistence on this rule was simply part of an elaborate and\ninveterate system of \"relations\" (the whole of French social life seemed\nto depend on the exact interpretation of that word), and Undine felt\nthe uselessness of struggling against such mysterious inhibitions. He\nreminded her, however, that their inability to receive would give them\nall the more opportunity for going out, and he showed himself more\nsocially disposed than in the past. But his concession did not result as\nshe had hoped. They were asked out as much as ever, but they were asked\nto big dinners, to impersonal crushes, to the kind of entertainment\nit is a slight to be omitted from but no compliment to be included in.\nNothing could have been more galling to Undine, and she frankly bewailed\nthe fact to Madame de Trezac.\n\n\"Of course it's what was sure to come of being mewed up for months and\nmonths in the country. We're out of everything, and the people who are\nhaving a good time are simply too busy to remember us. We're only asked\nto the things that are made up from visiting-lists.\"\n\nMadame de Trezac listened sympathetically, but did not suppress a candid\nanswer.\n\n\"It's not altogether that, my dear; Raymond's not a man his friends\nforget. It's rather more, if you'll excuse my saying so, the fact of\nyour being--you personally--in the wrong set.\"\n\n\"The wrong set? Why, I'm in HIS set--the one that thinks itself too good\nfor all the others. That's what you've always told me when I've said it\nbored me.\"\n\n\"Well, that's what I mean--\" Madame de Trezac took the plunge. \"It's not\na question of your being bored.\"\n\nUndine coloured; but she could take the hardest thrusts where her\npersonal interest was involved. \"You mean that I'M the bore, then?\"\n\n\"Well, you don't work hard enough--you don't keep up. It's not that they\ndon't admire you--your looks, I mean; they think you beautiful; they're\ndelighted to bring you out at their big dinners, with the Sevres and\nthe plate. But a woman has got to be something more than good-looking to\nhave a chance to be intimate with them: she's got to know what's being\nsaid about things. I watched you the other night at the Duchess's, and\nhalf the time you hadn't an idea what they were talking about. I haven't\nalways, either; but then I have to put up with the big dinners.\"\n\nUndine winced under the criticism; but she had never lacked insight into\nthe cause of her own failures, and she had already had premonitions\nof what Madame de Trezac so bluntly phrased. When Raymond ceased to\nbe interested in her conversation she had concluded it was the way of\nhusbands; but since then it had been slowly dawning on her that she\nproduced the same effect on others. Her entrances were always triumphs;\nbut they had no sequel. As soon as people began to talk they ceased to\nsee her. Any sense of insufficiency exasperated her, and she had vague\nthoughts of cultivating herself, and went so far as to spend a\nmorning in the Louvre and go to one or two lectures by a fashionable\nphilosopher. But though she returned from these expeditions charged with\nopinions, their expression did not excite the interest she had hoped.\nHer views, if abundant, were confused, and the more she said the more\nnebulous they seemed to grow. She was disconcerted, moreover, by finding\nthat everybody appeared to know about the things she thought she had\ndiscovered, and her comments clearly produced more bewilderment than\ninterest.\n\nRemembering the attention she had attracted on her first appearance in\nRaymond's world she concluded that she had \"gone off\" or grown dowdy,\nand instead of wasting more time in museums and lecture-halls she\nprolonged her hours at the dress-maker's and gave up the rest of the day\nto the scientific cultivation of her beauty.\n\n\"I suppose I've turned into a perfect frump down there in that\nwilderness,\" she lamented to Madame de Trezac, who replied inexorably:\n\"Oh, no, you're as handsome as ever; but people here don't go on looking\nat each other forever as they do in London.\"\n\nMeanwhile financial cares became more pressing. A dunning letter from\none of her tradesmen fell into Raymond's hands, and the talk it led to\nended in his making it clear to her that she must settle her personal\ndebts without his aid. All the \"scenes\" about money which had disturbed\nher past had ended in some mysterious solution of her difficulty.\nDisagreeable as they were, she had always, vulgarly speaking, found they\npaid; but now it was she who was expected to pay. Raymond took his\nstand without ill-temper or apology: he simply argued from inveterate\nprecedent. But it was impossible for Undine to understand a social\norganization which did not regard the indulging of woman as its first\npurpose, or to believe that any one taking another view was not moved by\navarice or malice; and the discussion ended in mutual acrimony.\n\nThe morning afterward, Raymond came into her room with a letter in his\nhand.\n\n\"Is this your doing?\" he asked. His look and voice expressed something\nshe had never known before: the disciplined anger of a man trained to\nkeep his emotions in fixed channels, but knowing how to fill them to the\nbrim.\n\nThe letter was from Mr. Fleischhauer, who begged to transmit to the\nMarquis de Chelles an offer for his Boucher tapestries from a client\nprepared to pay the large sum named on condition that it was accepted\nbefore his approaching departure for America.\n\n\"What does it mean?\" Raymond continued, as she did not speak.\n\n\"How should I know? It's a lot of money,\" she stammered, shaken out\nof her self-possession. She had not expected so prompt a sequel to\nthe dealer's visit, and she was vexed with him for writing to Raymond\nwithout consulting her. But she recognized Moffatt's high-handed way,\nand her fears faded in the great blaze of the sum he offered.\n\nHer husband was still looking at her. \"It was Fleischhauer who brought a\nman down to see the tapestries one day when I was away at Beaune?\"\n\nHe had known, then--everything was known at Saint Desert!\n\nShe wavered a moment and then gave him back his look.\n\n\"Yes--it was Fleischhauer; and I sent for him.\"\n\n\"You sent for him?\"\n\nHe spoke in a voice so veiled and repressed that he seemed to be\nconsciously saving it for some premeditated outbreak. Undine felt its\nmenace, but the thought of Moffatt sent a flame through her, and the\nwords he would have spoken seemed to fly to her lips.\n\n\"Why shouldn't I? Something had to be done. We can't go on as we are.\nI've tried my best to economize--I've scraped and scrimped, and gone\nwithout heaps of things I've always had. I've moped for months and\nmonths at Saint Desert, and given up sending Paul to school because it\nwas too expensive, and asking my friends to dine because we couldn't\nafford it. And you expect me to go on living like this for the rest of\nmy life, when all you've got to do is to hold out your hand and have two\nmillion francs drop into it!\"\n\nHer husband stood looking at her coldly and curiously, as though she\nwere some alien apparition his eyes had never before beheld.\n\n\"Ah, that's your answer--that's all you feel when you lay hands on\nthings that are sacred to us!\" He stopped a moment, and then let his\nvoice break out with the volume she had felt it to be gathering. \"And\nyou're all alike,\" he exclaimed, \"every one of you. You come among us\nfrom a country we don't know, and can't imagine, a country you care for\nso little that before you've been a day in ours you've forgotten the\nvery house you were born in--if it wasn't torn down before you knew it!\nYou come among us speaking our language and not knowing what we mean;\nwanting the things we want, and not knowing why we want them; aping our\nweaknesses, exaggerating our follies, ignoring or ridiculing all we care\nabout--you come from hotels as big as towns, and from towns as flimsy as\npaper, where the streets haven't had time to be named, and the buildings\nare demolished before they're dry, and the people are as proud of\nchanging as we are of holding to what we have--and we're fools enough\nto imagine that because you copy our ways and pick up our slang\nyou understand anything about the things that make life decent and\nhonourable for us!\"\n\nHe stopped again, his white face and drawn nostrils giving him so much\nthe look of an extremely distinguished actor in a fine part that, in\nspite of the vehemence of his emotion, his silence might have been the\ndeliberate pause for a replique. Undine kept him waiting long enough\nto give the effect of having lost her cue--then she brought out, with\na little soft stare of incredulity: \"Do you mean to say you're going to\nrefuse such an offer?\"\n\n\"Ah--!\" He turned back from the door, and picking up the letter that lay\non the table between them, tore it in pieces and tossed the pieces on\nthe floor. \"That's how I refuse it!\"\n\nThe violence of his tone and gesture made her feel as though the\nfluttering strips were so many lashes laid across her face, and a rage\nthat was half fear possessed her.\n\n\"How dare you speak to me like that? Nobody's ever dared to before. Is\ntalking to a woman in that way one of the things you call decent and\nhonourable? Now that I know what you feel about me I don't want to stay\nin your house another day. And I don't mean to--I mean to walk out of it\nthis very hour!\"\n\nFor a moment they stood face to face, the depths of their mutual\nincomprehension at last bared to each other's angry eyes; then Raymond,\nhis glance travelling past her, pointed to the fragments of paper on the\nfloor.\n\n\"If you're capable of that you're capable of anything!\" he said as he\nwent out of the room.\n\n\n\nXLIII\n\nShe watched him go in a kind of stupour, knowing that when they next met\nhe would be as courteous and self-possessed as if nothing had happened,\nbut that everything would nevertheless go on in the same way--in HIS\nway--and that there was no more hope of shaking his resolve or altering\nhis point of view than there would have been of transporting the\ndeep-rooted masonry of Saint Desert by means of the wheeled supports on\nwhich Apex architecture performed its easy transits.\n\nOne of her childish rages possessed her, sweeping away every feeling\nsave the primitive impulse to hurt and destroy; but search as she would\nshe could not find a crack in the strong armour of her husband's habits\nand prejudices. For a long time she continued to sit where he had left\nher, staring at the portraits on the walls as though they had joined\nhands to imprison her. Hitherto she had almost always felt herself a\nmatch for circumstances, but now the very dead were leagued to defeat\nher: people she had never seen and whose names she couldn't even\nremember seemed to be plotting and contriving against her under the\nescutcheoned grave-stones of Saint Desert.\n\nHer eyes turned to the old warm-toned furniture beneath the pictures,\nand to her own idle image in the mirror above the mantelpiece. Even in\nthat one small room there were enough things of price to buy a release\nfrom her most pressing cares; and the great house, in which the room was\na mere cell, and the other greater house in Burgundy, held treasures\nto deplete even such a purse as Moffatt's. She liked to see such things\nabout her--without any real sense of their meaning she felt them to be\nthe appropriate setting of a pretty woman, to embody something of the\nrareness and distinction she had always considered she possessed; and\nshe reflected that if she had still been Moffatt's wife he would have\ngiven her just such a setting, and the power to live in it as became\nher.\n\nThe thought sent her memory flying back to things she had turned it from\nfor years. For the first time since their far-off weeks together she let\nherself relive the brief adventure. She had been drawn to Elmer Moffatt\nfrom the first--from the day when Ben Frusk, Indiana's brother, had\nbrought him to a church picnic at Mulvey's Grove, and he had taken\ninstant possession of Undine, sitting in the big \"stage\" beside her\non the \"ride\" to the grove, supplanting Millard Binch (to whom she was\nstill, though intermittently and incompletely, engaged), swinging her\nbetween the trees, rowing her on the lake, catching and kissing her\nin \"forfeits,\" awarding her the first prize in the Beauty Show he\nhilariously organized and gallantly carried out, and finally (no one\nknew how) contriving to borrow a buggy and a fast colt from old Mulvey,\nand driving off with her at a two-forty gait while Millard and the\nothers took their dust in the crawling stage.\n\nNo one in Apex knew where young Moffatt had come from, and he offered\nno information on the subject. He simply appeared one day behind the\ncounter in Luckaback's Dollar Shoe-store, drifted thence to the office\nof Semple and Binch, the coal-merchants, reappeared as the stenographer\nof the Police Court, and finally edged his way into the power-house\nof the Apex Water-Works. He boarded with old Mrs. Flynn, down in North\nFifth Street, on the edge of the red-light slum, he never went to church\nor attended lectures, or showed any desire to improve or refine himself;\nbut he managed to get himself invited to all the picnics and lodge\nsociables, and at a supper of the Phi Upsilon Society, to which he had\ncontrived to affiliate himself, he made the best speech that had been\nheard there since young Jim Rolliver's first flights. The brothers\nof Undine's friends all pronounced him \"great,\" though he had fits of\nuncouthness that made the young women slower in admitting him to favour.\nBut at the Mulvey's Grove picnic he suddenly seemed to dominate them\nall, and Undine, as she drove away with him, tasted the public triumph\nwhich was necessary to her personal enjoyment.\n\nAfter that he became a leading figure in the youthful world of Apex,\nand no one was surprised when the Sons of Jonadab, (the local Temperance\nSociety) invited him to deliver their Fourth of July oration. The\nceremony took place, as usual, in the Baptist church, and Undine, all\nin white, with a red rose in her breast, sat just beneath the platform,\nwith Indiana jealously glaring at her from a less privileged seat, and\npoor Millard's long neck craning over the row of prominent citizens\nbehind the orator.\n\nElmer Moffatt had been magnificent, rolling out his alternating effects\nof humour and pathos, stirring his audience by moving references to the\nBlue and the Gray, convulsing them by a new version of Washington and\nthe Cherry Tree (in which the infant patriot was depicted as having\ncut down the tree to check the deleterious spread of cherry bounce),\ndazzling them by his erudite allusions and apt quotations (he confessed\nto Undine that he had sat up half the night over Bartlett), and winding\nup with a peroration that drew tears from the Grand Army pensioners in\nthe front row and caused the minister's wife to say that many a sermon\nfrom that platform had been less uplifting.\n\nAn ice-cream supper always followed the \"exercises,\" and as repairs\nwere being made in the church basement, which was the usual scene of the\nfestivity, the minister had offered the use of his house. The long table\nran through the doorway between parlour and study, and another was set\nin the passage outside, with one end under the stairs. The stair-rail\nwas wreathed in fire-weed and early golden-rod, and Temperance texts in\nsmilax decked the walls. When the first course had been despatched the\nyoung ladies, gallantly seconded by the younger of the \"Sons,\" helped to\nladle out and carry in the ice-cream, which stood in great pails on the\nlarder floor, and to replenish the jugs of lemonade and coffee. Elmer\nMoffatt was indefatigable in performing these services, and when the\nminister's wife pressed him to sit down and take a mouthful himself he\nmodestly declined the place reserved for him among the dignitaries of\nthe evening, and withdrew with a few chosen spirits to the dim table-end\nbeneath the stairs. Explosions of hilarity came from this corner with\nincreasing frequency, and now and then tumultuous rappings and howls of\n\"Song! Song!\" followed by adjurations to \"Cough it up\" and \"Let her go,\"\ndrowned the conversational efforts at the other table.\n\nAt length the noise subsided, and the group was ceasing to attract\nattention when, toward the end of the evening, the upper table, drooping\nunder the lengthy elucubrations of the minister and the President of the\nTemperance Society, called on the orator of the day for a few remarks.\nThere was an interval of scuffling and laughter beneath the stairs, and\nthen the minister's lifted hand enjoined silence and Elmer Moffatt got\nto his feet.\n\n\"Step out where the ladies can hear you better, Mr. Moffatt!\" the\nminister called. Moffatt did so, steadying himself against the table and\ntwisting his head about as if his collar had grown too tight. But if his\nbearing was vacillating his smile was unabashed, and there was no lack\nof confidence in the glance he threw at Undine Spragg as he began:\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen, if there's one thing I like better than another\nabout getting drunk--and I like most everything about it except the next\nmorning--it's the opportunity you've given me of doing it right here,\nin the presence of this Society, which, as I gather from its\nliterature, knows more about the subject than anybody else. Ladies and\nGentlemen\"--he straightened himself, and the table-cloth slid toward\nhim--\"ever since you honoured me with an invitation to address you from\nthe temperance platform I've been assiduously studying that literature;\nand I've gathered from your own evidence--what I'd strongly suspected\nbefore--that all your converted drunkards had a hell of a good time\nbefore you got at 'em, and that... and that a good many of 'em have gone\non having it since...\"\n\nAt this point he broke off, swept the audience with his confident smile,\nand then, collapsing, tried to sit down on a chair that didn't happen to\nbe there, and disappeared among his agitated supporters.\n\nThere was a night-mare moment during which Undine, through the doorway,\nsaw Ben Frusk and the others close about the fallen orator to the crash\nof crockery and tumbling chairs; then some one jumped up and shut the\nparlour door, and a long-necked Sunday school teacher, who had been\nnervously waiting his chance, and had almost given it up, rose from his\nfeet and recited High Tide at Gettysburg amid hysterical applause.\n\nThe scandal was considerable, but Moffatt, though he vanished from the\nsocial horizon, managed to keep his place in the power-house till he\nwent off for a week and turned up again without being able to give a\nsatisfactory reason for his absence. After that he drifted from one job\nto another, now extolled for his \"smartness\" and business capacity, now\ndismissed in disgrace as an irresponsible loafer. His head was always\nfull of immense nebulous schemes for the enlargement and development of\nany business he happened to be employed in. Sometimes his suggestions\ninterested his employers, but proved unpractical and inapplicable;\nsometimes he wore out their patience or was thought to be a dangerous\ndreamer. Whenever he found there was no hope of his ideas being adopted\nhe lost interest in his work, came late and left early, or disappeared\nfor two or three days at a time without troubling himself to account for\nhis absences. At last even those who had been cynical enough to smile\nover his disgrace at the temperance supper began to speak of him as a\nhopeless failure, and he lost the support of the feminine community\nwhen one Sunday morning, just as the Baptist and Methodist churches were\nreleasing their congregations, he walked up Eubaw Avenue with a young\nwoman less known to those sacred edifices than to the saloons of North\nFifth Street.\n\nUndine's estimate of people had always been based on their apparent\npower of getting what they wanted--provided it came under the category\nof things she understood wanting. Success was beauty and romance to her;\nyet it was at the moment when Elmer Moffatt's failure was most complete\nand flagrant that she suddenly felt the extent of his power. After the\nEubaw Avenue scandal he had been asked not to return to the surveyor's\noffice to which Ben Frusk had managed to get him admitted; and on the\nday of his dismissal he met Undine in Main Street, at the shopping hour,\nand, sauntering up cheerfully, invited her to take a walk with him. She\nwas about to refuse when she saw Millard Binch's mother looking at her\ndisapprovingly from the opposite street-corner.\n\n\"Oh, well, I will--\" she said; and they walked the length of Main Street\nand out to the immature park in which it ended. She was in a mood of\naimless discontent and unrest, tired of her engagement to Millard Binch,\ndisappointed with Moffatt, half-ashamed of being seen with him, and yet\nnot sorry to have it known that she was independent enough to choose her\ncompanions without regard to the Apex verdict.\n\n\"Well, I suppose you know I'm down and out,\" he began; and she responded\nvirtuously: \"You must have wanted to be, or you wouldn't have behaved\nthe way you did last Sunday.\"\n\n\"Oh, shucks!\" he sneered. \"What do I care, in a one-horse place like\nthis? If it hadn't been for you I'd have got a move on long ago.\"\n\nShe did not remember afterward what else he said: she recalled only the\nexpression of a great sweeping scorn of Apex, into which her own disdain\nof it was absorbed like a drop in the sea, and the affirmation of a\nsoaring self-confidence that seemed to lift her on wings. All her own\nattempts to get what she wanted had come to nothing; but she had always\nattributed her lack of success to the fact that she had had no one to\nsecond her. It was strange that Elmer Moffatt, a shiftless out-cast from\neven the small world she despised, should give her, in the very moment\nof his downfall, the sense of being able to succeed where she had\nfailed. It was a feeling she never had in his absence, but that his\nnearness always instantly revived; and he seemed nearer to her now than\nhe had ever been. They wandered on to the edge of the vague park, and\nsat down on a bench behind the empty band-stand.\n\n\"I went with that girl on purpose, and you know it,\" he broke out\nabruptly. \"It makes me too damned sick to see Millard Binch going round\nlooking as if he'd patented you.\"\n\n\"You've got no right--\" she interrupted; and suddenly she was in his\narms, and feeling that no one had ever kissed her before....\n\nThe week that followed was a big bright blur--the wildest vividest\nmoment of her life. And it was only eight days later that they were in\nthe train together, Apex and all her plans and promises behind them, and\na bigger and brighter blur ahead, into which they were plunging as the\n\"Limited\" plunged into the sunset....\n\nUndine stood up, looking about her with vague eyes, as if she had come\nback from a long distance. Elmer Moffatt was still in Paris--he was in\nreach, within telephone-call. She stood hesitating a moment; then she\nwent into her dressing-room, and turning over the pages of the telephone\nbook, looked out the number of the Nouveau Luxe....\n\n\n\nXLIV\n\nUndine had been right in supposing that her husband would expect\ntheir life to go on as before. There was no appreciable change in the\nsituation save that he was more often absent-finding abundant reasons,\nagricultural and political, for frequent trips to Saint Desert--and\nthat, when in Paris, he no longer showed any curiosity concerning\nher occupations and engagements. They lived as much apart is if\ntheir cramped domicile had been a palace; and when Undine--as she now\nfrequently did--joined the Shallums or Rollivers for a dinner at the\nNouveau Luxe, or a party at a petit theatre, she was not put to the\ntrouble of prevaricating.\n\nHer first impulse, after her scene with Raymond, had been to ring up\nIndiana Rolliver and invite herself to dine. It chanced that Indiana\n(who was now in full social progress, and had \"run over\" for a few weeks\nto get her dresses for Newport) had organized for the same evening a\nshowy cosmopolitan banquet in which she was enchanted to include the\nMarquise de Chelles; and Undine, as she had hoped, found Elmer Moffatt\nof the party. When she drove up to the Nouveau Luxe she had not fixed\non any plan of action; but once she had crossed its magic threshold her\nenergies revived like plants in water. At last she was in her native air\nagain, among associations she shared and conventions she understood;\nand all her self-confidence returned as the familiar accents uttered the\naccustomed things.\n\nSave for an occasional perfunctory call, she had hitherto made no effort\nto see her compatriots, and she noticed that Mrs. Jim Driscoll and\nBertha Shallum received her with a touch of constraint; but it vanished\nwhen they remarked the cordiality of Moffatt's greeting. Her seat was\nat his side, and her old sense of triumph returned as she perceived the\nimportance his notice conferred, not only in the eyes of her own party\nbut of the other diners. Moffatt was evidently a notable figure in all\nthe worlds represented about the crowded tables, and Undine saw that\nmany people who seemed personally unacquainted with him were recognizing\nand pointing him out. She was conscious of receiving a large share\nof the attention he attracted, and, bathed again in the bright air of\npublicity, she remembered the evening when Raymond de Chelles' first\nadmiring glance had given her the same sense of triumph.\n\nThis inopportune memory did not trouble her: she was almost grateful to\nRaymond for giving her the touch of superiority her compatriots clearly\nfelt in her. It was not merely her title and her \"situation,\" but the\nexperiences she had gained through them, that gave her this advantage\nover the loud vague company. She had learned things they did not guess:\nshades of conduct, turns of speech, tricks of attitude--and easy and\nfree and enviable as she thought them, she would not for the world have\nbeen back among them at the cost of knowing no more than they.\n\nMoffatt made no allusion to his visit to Saint Desert; but when the\nparty had re-grouped itself about coffee and liqueurs on the terrace, he\nbent over to ask confidentially: \"What about my tapestries?\"\n\nShe replied in the same tone: \"You oughtn't to have let Fleischhauer\nwrite that letter. My husband's furious.\"\n\nHe seemed honestly surprised. \"Why? Didn't I offer him enough?\"\n\n\"He's furious that any one should offer anything. I thought when he\nfound out what they were worth he might be tempted; but he'd rather see\nme starve than part with one of his grand-father's snuff-boxes.\"\n\n\"Well, he knows now what the tapestries are worth. I offered more than\nFleischhauer advised.\"\n\n\"Yes; but you were in too much of a hurry.\"\n\n\"I've got to be; I'm going back next week.\"\n\nShe felt her eyes cloud with disappointment. \"Oh, why do you? I hoped\nyou might stay on.\"\n\nThey looked at each other uncertainly a moment; then he dropped his\nvoice to say: \"Even if I did, I probably shouldn't see anything of you.\"\n\n\"Why not? Why won't you come and see me? I've always wanted to be\nfriends.\"\n\nHe came the next day and found in her drawing-room two ladies whom she\nintroduced as her sisters-in-law. The ladies lingered on for a long\ntime, sipping their tea stiffly and exchanging low-voiced remarks while\nUndine talked with Moffatt; and when they left, with small sidelong bows\nin his direction.\n\nUndine exclaimed: \"Now you see how they all watch me!\"\n\nShe began to go into the details of her married life, drawing on the\nexperiences of the first months for instances that scarcely applied to\nher present liberated state. She could thus, without great exaggeration,\npicture herself as entrapped into a bondage hardly conceivable to\nMoffatt, and she saw him redden with excitement as he listened. \"I call\nit darned low--darned low--\" he broke in at intervals.\n\n\"Of course I go round more now,\" she concluded. \"I mean to see my\nfriends--I don't care what he says.\"\n\n\"What CAN he say?\"\n\n\"Oh, he despises Americans--they all do.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess we can still sit up and take nourishment.\"\n\nThey laughed and slipped back to talking of earlier things. She urged\nhim to put off his sailing--there were so many things they might do\ntogether: sight-seeing and excursions--and she could perhaps show him\nsome of the private collections he hadn't seen, the ones it was hard to\nget admitted to. This instantly roused his attention, and after naming\none or two collections he had already seen she hit on one he had found\ninaccessible and was particularly anxious to visit. \"There's an Ingres\nthere that's one of the things I came over to have a look at; but I was\ntold there was no use trying.\"\n\n\"Oh, I can easily manage it: the Duke's Raymond's uncle.\" It gave her\na peculiar satisfaction to say it: she felt as though she were taking a\nsurreptitious revenge on her husband. \"But he's down in the country this\nweek,\" she continued, \"and no one--not even the family--is allowed to\nsee the pictures when he's away. Of course his Ingres are the finest in\nFrance.\"\n\nShe ran it off glibly, though a year ago she had never heard of the\npainter, and did not, even now, remember whether he was an Old Master or\none of the very new ones whose names one hadn't had time to learn.\n\nMoffatt put off sailing, saw the Duke's Ingres under her guidance,\nand accompanied her to various other private galleries inaccessible\nto strangers. She had lived in almost total ignorance of such\nopportunities, but now that she could use them to advantage she showed a\nsurprising quickness in picking up \"tips,\" ferreting out rare things and\ngetting a sight of hidden treasures. She even acquired as much of\nthe jargon as a pretty woman needs to produce the impression of being\nwell-informed; and Moffatt's sailing was more than once postponed.\n\nThey saw each other almost daily, for she continued to come and go as\nshe pleased, and Raymond showed neither surprise nor disapproval. When\nthey were asked to family dinners she usually excused herself at the\nlast moment on the plea of a headache and, calling up Indiana or Bertha\nShallum, improvised a little party at the Nouveau Luxe; and on other\noccasions she accepted such invitations as she chose, without mentioning\nto her husband where she was going.\n\nIn this world of lavish pleasures she lost what little prudence the\ndiscipline of Saint Desert had inculcated. She could never be with\npeople who had all the things she envied without being hypnotized into\nthe belief that she had only to put her hand out to obtain them, and all\nthe unassuaged rancours and hungers of her early days in West End Avenue\ncame back with increased acuity. She knew her wants so much better now,\nand was so much more worthy of the things she wanted!\n\nShe had given up hoping that her father might make another hit in Wall\nStreet. Mrs. Spragg's letters gave the impression that the days of big\nstrokes were over for her husband, that he had gone down in the conflict\nwith forces beyond his measure. If he had remained in Apex the tide of\nits new prosperity might have carried him to wealth; but New York's huge\nwaves of success had submerged instead of floating him, and Rolliver's\nenmity was a hand perpetually stretched out to strike him lower. At\nmost, Mr. Spragg's tenacity would keep him at the level he now held, and\nthough he and his wife had still further simplified their way of\nliving Undine understood that their self-denial would not increase\nher opportunities. She felt no compunction in continuing to accept an\nundiminished allowance: it was the hereditary habit of the parent animal\nto despoil himself for his progeny. But this conviction did not seem\nincompatible with a sentimental pity for her parents. Aside from all\ninterested motives, she wished for their own sakes that they were better\noff. Their personal requirements were pathetically limited, but renewed\nprosperity would at least have procured them the happiness of giving her\nwhat she wanted.\n\nMoffatt lingered on; but he began to speak more definitely of sailing,\nand Undine foresaw the day when, strong as her attraction was, stronger\ninfluences would snap it like a thread. She knew she interested and\namused him, and that it flattered his vanity to be seen with her, and to\nhear that rumour coupled their names; but he gave her, more than any\none she had ever known, the sense of being detached from his life, in\ncontrol of it, and able, without weakness or uncertainty, to choose\nwhich of its calls he should obey. If the call were that of business--of\nany of the great perilous affairs he handled like a snake-charmer\nspinning the deadly reptiles about his head--she knew she would drop\nfrom his life like a loosened leaf.\n\nThese anxieties sharpened the intensity of her enjoyment, and made\nthe contrast keener between her crowded sparkling hours and the vacant\nmonths at Saint Desert. Little as she understood of the qualities that\nmade Moffatt what he was, the results were of the kind most palpable to\nher. He used life exactly as she would have used it in his place. Some\nof his enjoyments were beyond her range, but even these appealed to her\nbecause of the money that was required to gratify them. When she took\nhim to see some inaccessible picture, or went with him to inspect the\ntreasures of a famous dealer, she saw that the things he looked at moved\nhim in a way she could not understand, and that the actual touching of\nrare textures--bronze or marble, or velvets flushed with the bloom of\nage--gave him sensations like those her own beauty had once roused in\nhim. But the next moment he was laughing over some commonplace joke,\nor absorbed in a long cipher cable handed to him as they re-entered the\nNouveau Luxe for tea, and his aesthetic emotions had been thrust back\ninto their own compartment of the great steel strong-box of his mind.\n\nHer new life went on without comment or interference from her husband,\nand she saw that he had accepted their altered relation, and intended\nmerely to keep up an external semblance of harmony. To that semblance\nshe knew he attached intense importance: it was an article of his\ncomplicated social creed that a man of his class should appear to live\non good terms with his wife. For different reasons it was scarcely\nless important to Undine: she had no wish to affront again the social\nreprobation that had so nearly wrecked her. But she could not keep up\nthe life she was leading without more money, a great deal more money;\nand the thought of contracting her expenditure was no longer tolerable.\n\nOne afternoon, several weeks later, she came in to find a tradesman's\nrepresentative waiting with a bill. There was a noisy scene in the\nanteroom before the man threateningly withdrew--a scene witnessed by the\nservants, and overheard by her mother-in-law, whom she found seated\nin the drawing-room when she entered. The old Marquise's visits to her\ndaughter-in-law were made at long intervals but with ritual regularity;\nshe called every other Friday at five, and Undine had forgotten that she\nwas due that day. This did not make for greater cordiality between them,\nand the altercation in the anteroom had been too loud for concealment.\nThe Marquise was on her feet when her daughter-in-law came in, and\ninstantly said with lowered eyes: \"It would perhaps be best for me to\ngo.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't care. You're welcome to tell Raymond you've heard me\ninsulted because I'm too poor to pay my bills--he knows it well enough\nalready!\" The words broke from Undine unguardedly, but once spoken they\nnourished her defiance.\n\n\"I'm sure my son has frequently recommended greater prudence--\" the\nMarquise murmured.\n\n\"Yes! It's a pity he didn't recommend it to your other son instead! All\nthe money I was entitled to has gone to pay Hubert's debts.\"\n\n\"Raymond has told me that there are certain things you fail to\nunderstand--I have no wish whatever to discuss them.\" The Marquise had\ngone toward the door; with her hand on it she paused to add: \"I shall\nsay nothing whatever of what has happened.\"\n\nHer icy magnanimity added the last touch to Undine's wrath. They knew\nher extremity, one and all, and it did not move them. At most, they\nwould join in concealing it like a blot on their honour. And the menace\ngrew and mounted, and not a hand was stretched to help her....\n\nHardly a half-hour earlier Moffatt, with whom she had been visiting a\n\"private view,\" had sent her home in his motor with the excuse that he\nmust hurry back to the Nouveau Luxe to meet his stenographer and sign a\nbatch of letters for the New York mail. It was therefore probable that\nhe was still at home--that she should find him if she hastened there\nat once. An overwhelming desire to cry out her wrath and wretchedness\nbrought her to her feet and sent her down to hail a passing cab. As it\nwhirled her through the bright streets powdered with amber sunlight her\nbrain throbbed with confused intentions. She did not think of Moffatt\nas a power she could use, but simply as some one who knew her and\nunderstood her grievance. It was essential to her at that moment to be\ntold that she was right and that every one opposed to her was wrong.\n\nAt the hotel she asked his number and was carried up in the lift. On the\nlanding she paused a moment, disconcerted--it had occurred to her that\nhe might not be alone. But she walked on quickly, found the number and\nknocked.... Moffatt opened the door, and she glanced beyond him and saw\nthat the big bright sitting-room was empty.\n\n\"Hullo!\" he exclaimed, surprised; and as he stood aside to let her enter\nshe saw him draw out his watch and glance at it surreptitiously. He was\nexpecting someone, or he had an engagement elsewhere--something claimed\nhim from which she was excluded. The thought flushed her with sudden\nresolution. She knew now what she had come for--to keep him from every\none else, to keep him for herself alone.\n\n\"Don't send me away!\" she said, and laid her hand on his beseechingly.\n\n\n\nXLV\n\nShe advanced into the room and slowly looked about her. The big vulgar\nwriting-table wreathed in bronze was heaped with letters and papers.\nAmong them stood a lapis bowl in a Renaissance mounting of enamel and\na vase of Phenician glass that was like a bit of rainbow caught in\ncobwebs. On a table against the window a little Greek marble lifted its\npure lines. On every side some rare and sensitive object seemed to be\nshrinking back from the false colours and crude contours of the hotel\nfurniture. There were no books in the room, but the florid console under\nthe mirror was stacked with old numbers of Town Talk and the New York\nRadiator. Undine recalled the dingy hall-room that Moffatt had lodged in\nat Mrs. Flynn's, over Hober's livery stable, and her heart beat at the\nsigns of his altered state. When her eyes came back to him their lids\nwere moist.\n\n\"Don't send me away,\" she repeated. He looked at her and smiled. \"What\nis it? What's the matter?\"\n\n\"I don't know--but I had to come. To-day, when you spoke again of\nsailing, I felt as if I couldn't stand it.\" She lifted her eyes and\nlooked in his profoundly.\n\nHe reddened a little under her gaze, but she could detect no softening\nor confusion in the shrewd steady glance he gave her back.\n\n\"Things going wrong again--is that the trouble?\" he merely asked with a\ncomforting inflexion.\n\n\"They always are wrong; it's all been an awful mistake. But I shouldn't\ncare if you were here and I could see you sometimes. You're so STRONG:\nthat's what I feel about you, Elmer. I was the only one to feel it that\ntime they all turned against you out at Apex.... Do you remember the\nafternoon I met you down on Main Street, and we walked out together to\nthe Park? I knew then that you were stronger than any of them....\"\n\nShe had never spoken more sincerely. For the moment all thought of\nself-interest was in abeyance, and she felt again, as she had felt\nthat day, the instinctive yearning of her nature to be one with his.\nSomething in her voice must have attested it, for she saw a change in\nhis face.\n\n\"You're not the beauty you were,\" he said irrelevantly; \"but you're a\nlot more fetching.\"\n\nThe oddly qualified praise made her laugh with mingled pleasure and\nannoyance.\n\n\"I suppose I must be dreadfully changed--\"\n\n\"You're all right!--But I've got to go back home,\" he broke off\nabruptly. \"I've put it off too long.\"\n\nShe paled and looked away, helpless in her sudden disappointment. \"I\nknew you'd say that.... And I shall just be left here....\" She sat down\non the sofa near which they had been standing, and two tears formed on\nher lashes and fell.\n\nMoffatt sat down beside her, and both were silent. She had never seen\nhim at a loss before. She made no attempt to draw nearer, or to use any\nof the arts of cajolery; but presently she said, without rising: \"I\nsaw you look at your watch when I came in. I suppose somebody else is\nwaiting for you.\"\n\n\"It don't matter.\"\n\n\"Some other woman?\"\n\n\"It don't matter.\"\n\n\"I've wondered so often--but of course I've got no right to ask.\" She\nstood up slowly, understanding that he meant to let her go.\n\n\"Just tell me one thing--did you never miss me?\"\n\n\"Oh, damnably!\" he brought out with sudden bitterness.\n\nShe came nearer, sinking her voice to a low whisper. \"It's the only time\nI ever really cared--all through!\"\n\nHe had risen too, and they stood intensely gazing at each other.\nMoffatt's face was fixed and grave, as she had seen it in hours she now\nfound herself rapidly reliving.\n\n\"I believe you DID,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh, Elmer--if I'd known--if I'd only known!\"\n\nHe made no answer, and she turned away, touching with an unconscious\nhand the edge of the lapis bowl among his papers.\n\n\"Elmer, if you're going away it can't do any harm to tell me--is there\nany one else?\"\n\nHe gave a laugh that seemed to shake him free. \"In that kind of way?\nLord, no! Too busy!\"\n\nShe came close again and laid a hand on his shoulder. \"Then why not--why\nshouldn't we--?\" She leaned her head back so that her gaze slanted up\nthrough her wet lashes. \"I can do as I please--my husband does. They\nthink so differently about marriage over here: it's just a business\ncontract. As long as a woman doesn't make a show of herself no one\ncares.\" She put her other hand up, so that she held him facing her.\n\"I've always felt, all through everything, that I belonged to you.\"\n\nMoffatt left her hands on his shoulders, but did not lift his own to\nclasp them. For a moment she thought she had mistaken him, and a leaden\nsense of shame descended on her. Then he asked: \"You say your husband\ngoes with other women?\"\n\nLili Estradina's taunt flashed through her and she seized on it. \"People\nhave told me so--his own relations have. I've never stooped to spy on\nhim....\"\n\n\"And the women in your set--I suppose it's taken for granted they all do\nthe same?\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n\"Everything fixed up for them, same as it is for the husbands, eh?\nNobody meddles or makes trouble if you know the ropes?\"\n\n\"No, nobody ... it's all quite easy....\" She stopped, her faint\nsmile checked, as his backward movement made her hands drop from his\nshoulders.\n\n\"And that's what you're proposing to me? That you and I should do like\nthe rest of 'em?\" His face had lost its comic roundness and grown harsh\nand dark, as it had when her father had taken her away from him at\nOpake. He turned on his heel, walked the length of the room and halted\nwith his back to her in the embrasure of the window. There he paused\na full minute, his hands in his pockets, staring out at the perpetual\ninterweaving of motors in the luminous setting of the square. Then he\nturned and spoke from where he stood.\n\n\"Look here. Undine, if I'm to have you again I don't want to have you\nthat way. That time out in Apex, when everybody in the place was against\nme, and I was down and out, you stood up to them and stuck by me.\nRemember that walk down Main Street? Don't I!--and the way the people\nglared and hurried by; and how you kept on alongside of me, talking and\nlaughing, and looking your Sunday best. When Abner Spragg came out to\nOpake after us and pulled you back I was pretty sore at your deserting;\nbut I came to see it was natural enough. You were only a spoilt girl,\nused to having everything you wanted; and I couldn't give you a thing\nthen, and the folks you'd been taught to believe in all told you I never\nwould. Well, I did look like a back number, and no blame to you for\nthinking so. I used to say it to myself over and over again, laying\nawake nights and totting up my mistakes ... and then there were days\nwhen the wind set another way, and I knew I'd pull it off yet, and\nI thought you might have held on....\" He stopped, his head a little\nlowered, his concentrated gaze on her flushed face. \"Well, anyhow,\" he\nbroke out, \"you were my wife once, and you were my wife first--and if\nyou want to come back you've got to come that way: not slink through the\nback way when there's no one watching, but walk in by the front door,\nwith your head up, and your Main Street look.\"\n\nSince the days when he had poured out to her his great fortune-building\nprojects she had never heard him make so long a speech; and her heart,\nas she listened, beat with a new joy and terror. It seemed to her that\nthe great moment of her life had come at last--the moment all her minor\nfailures and successes had been building up with blind indefatigable\nhands.\n\n\"Elmer--Elmer--\" she sobbed out.\n\nShe expected to find herself in his arms, shut in and shielded from all\nher troubles; but he stood his ground across the room, immovable.\n\n\"Is it yes?\"\n\nShe faltered the word after him: \"Yes--?\"\n\n\"Are you going to marry me?\"\n\nShe stared, bewildered. \"Why, Elmer--marry you? You forget!\"\n\n\"Forget what? That you don't want to give up what you've got?\"\n\n\"How can I? Such things are not done out here. Why, I'm a Catholic; and\nthe Catholic Church--\" She broke off, reading the end in his face. \"But\nlater, perhaps ... things might change. Oh, Elmer, if only you'd stay\nover here and let me see you sometimes!\"\n\n\"Yes--the way your friends see each other. We're differently made out in\nApex. When I want that sort of thing I go down to North Fifth Street for\nit.\"\n\nShe paled under the retort, but her heart beat high with it. What he\nasked was impossible--and she gloried in his asking it. Feeling her\npower, she tried to temporize. \"At least if you stayed we could be\nfriends--I shouldn't feel so terribly alone.\"\n\nHe laughed impatiently. \"Don't talk magazine stuff to me, Undine Spragg.\nI guess we want each other the same way. Only our ideas are different.\nYou've got all muddled, living out here among a lot of loafers who call\nit a career to run round after every petticoat. I've got my job out at\nhome, and I belong where my job is.\"\n\n\"Are you going to be tied to business all your life?\" Her smile was\nfaintly depreciatory.\n\n\"I guess business is tied to ME: Wall Street acts as if it couldn't get\nalong without me.\" He gave his shoulders a shake and moved a few steps\nnearer. \"See here, Undine--you're the one that don't understand. If I\nwas to sell out to-morrow, and spend the rest of my life reading art\nmagazines in a pink villa, I wouldn't do what you're asking me. And\nI've about as much idea of dropping business as you have of taking to\ndistrict nursing. There are things a man doesn't do. I understand\nwhy your husband won't sell those tapestries--till he's got to. His\nancestors are HIS business: Wall Street's mine.\"\n\nHe paused, and they silently faced each other. Undine made no attempt\nto approach him: she understood that if he yielded it would be only to\nrecover his advantage and deepen her feeling of defeat. She put out her\nhand and took up the sunshade she had dropped on entering. \"I suppose\nit's good-bye then,\" she said.\n\n\"You haven't got the nerve?\"\n\n\"The nerve for what?\"\n\n\"To come where you belong: with me.\"\n\nShe laughed a little and then sighed. She wished he would come nearer,\nor look at her differently: she felt, under his cool eye, no more\ncompelling than a woman of wax in a show-case.\n\n\"How could I get a divorce? With my religion--\"\n\n\"Why, you were born a Baptist, weren't you? That's where you used to\nattend church when I waited round the corner, Sunday mornings, with one\nof old Hober's buggies.\" They both laughed, and he went on: \"If you'll\ncome along home with me I'll see you get your divorce all right. Who\ncares what they do over here? You're an American, ain't you? What you\nwant is the home-made article.\"\n\nShe listened, discouraged yet fascinated by his sturdy inaccessibility\nto all her arguments and objections. He knew what he wanted, saw his\nroad before him, and acknowledged no obstacles. Her defense was drawn\nfrom reasons he did not understand, or based on difficulties that did\nnot exist for him; and gradually she felt herself yielding to the steady\npressure of his will. Yet the reasons he brushed away came back with\nredoubled tenacity whenever he paused long enough for her to picture the\nconsequences of what he exacted.\n\n\"You don't know--you don't understand--\" she kept repeating; but she\nknew that his ignorance was part of his terrible power, and that it was\nhopeless to try to make him feel the value of what he was asking her to\ngive up.\n\n\"See here, Undine,\" he said slowly, as if he measured her resistance\nthough he couldn't fathom it, \"I guess it had better be yes or no right\nhere. It ain't going to do either of us any good to drag this thing out.\nIf you want to come back to me, come--if you don't, we'll shake hands on\nit now. I'm due in Apex for a directors' meeting on the twentieth, and\nas it is I'll have to cable for a special to get me out there. No, no,\ndon't cry--it ain't that kind of a story ... but I'll have a deck suite\nfor you on the Semantic if you'll sail with me the day after to-morrow.\"\n\n\n\nXLVI\n\nIn the great high-ceilinged library of a private hotel overlooking one\nof the new quarters of Paris, Paul Marvell stood listlessly gazing out\ninto the twilight.\n\nThe trees were budding symmetrically along the avenue below; and Paul,\nlooking down, saw, between windows and tree-tops, a pair of tall iron\ngates with gilt ornaments, the marble curb of a semi-circular drive,\nand bands of spring flowers set in turf. He was now a big boy of nearly\nnine, who went to a fashionable private school, and he had come home\nthat day for the Easter holidays. He had not been back since Christmas,\nand it was the first time he had seen the new hotel which his\nstep-father had bought, and in which Mr. and Mrs. Moffatt had hastily\nestablished themselves, a few weeks earlier, on their return from a\nflying trip to America. They were always coming and going; during the\ntwo years since their marriage they had been perpetually dashing over to\nNew York and back, or rushing down to Rome or up to the Engadine: Paul\nnever knew where they were except when a telegram announced that they\nwere going somewhere else. He did not even know that there was any\nmethod of communication between mothers and sons less laconic than that\nof the electric wire; and once, when a boy at school asked him if his\nmother often wrote, he had answered in all sincerity: \"Oh yes--I got a\ntelegram last week.\"\n\nHe had been almost sure--as sure as he ever was of anything--that he\nshould find her at home when he arrived; but a message (for she hadn't\nhad time to telegraph) apprised him that she and Mr. Moffatt had run\ndown to Deauville to look at a house they thought of hiring for the\nsummer; they were taking an early train back, and would be at home for\ndinner--were in fact having a lot of people to dine.\n\nIt was just what he ought to have expected, and had been used to ever\nsince he could remember; and generally he didn't much mind, especially\nsince his mother had become Mrs. Moffatt, and the father he had been\nmost used to, and liked best, had abruptly disappeared from his life.\nBut the new hotel was big and strange, and his own room, in which there\nwas not a toy or a book, or one of his dear battered relics (none of\nthe new servants--they were always new--could find his things, or think\nwhere they had been put), seemed the loneliest spot in the whole house.\nHe had gone up there after his solitary luncheon, served in the immense\nmarble dining-room by a footman on the same scale, and had tried to\noccupy himself with pasting post-cards into his album; but the newness\nand sumptuousness of the room embarrassed him--the white fur rugs\nand brocade chairs seemed maliciously on the watch for smears and\nink-spots--and after a while he pushed the album aside and began to roam\nthrough the house.\n\nHe went to all the rooms in turn: his mother's first, the wonderful lacy\nbedroom, all pale silks and velvets, artful mirrors and veiled lamps,\nand the boudoir as big as a drawing-room, with pictures he would have\nliked to know about, and tables and cabinets holding things he was\nafraid to touch. Mr. Moffatt's rooms came next. They were soberer and\ndarker, but as big and splendid; and in the bedroom, on the brown\nwall, hung a single picture--the portrait of a boy in grey velvet--that\ninterested Paul most of all. The boy's hand rested on the head of a big\ndog, and he looked infinitely noble and charming, and yet (in spite of\nthe dog) so sad and lonely that he too might have come home that very\nday to a strange house in which none of his old things could be found.\n\nFrom these rooms Paul wandered downstairs again. The library attracted\nhim most: there were rows and rows of books, bound in dim browns and\ngolds, and old faded reds as rich as velvet: they all looked as if they\nmight have had stories in them as splendid as their bindings. But the\nbookcases were closed with gilt trellising, and when Paul reached up\nto open one, a servant told him that Mr. Moffatt's secretary kept them\nlocked because the books were too valuable to be taken down. This seemed\nto make the library as strange as the rest of the house, and he passed\non to the ballroom at the back. Through its closed doors he heard a\nsound of hammering, and when he tried the door-handle a servant passing\nwith a tray-full of glasses told him that \"they\" hadn't finished, and\nwouldn't let anybody in.\n\nThe mysterious pronoun somehow increased Paul's sense of isolation, and\nhe went on to the drawing-rooms, steering his way prudently between the\ngold arm-chairs and shining tables, and wondering whether the wigged and\ncorseleted heroes on the walls represented Mr. Moffatt's ancestors, and\nwhy, if they did, he looked so little like them. The dining-room beyond\nwas more amusing, because busy servants were already laying the long\ntable. It was too early for the florist, and the centre of the table\nwas empty, but down the sides were gold baskets heaped with pulpy summer\nfruits-figs, strawberries and big blushing nectarines. Between them\nstood crystal decanters with red and yellow wine, and little dishes full\nof sweets; and against the walls were sideboards with great pieces\nof gold and silver, ewers and urns and branching candelabra, which\nsprinkled the green marble walls with starlike reflections.\n\nAfter a while he grew tired of watching the coming and going of\nwhite-sleeved footmen, and of listening to the butler's vociferated\norders, and strayed back into the library. The habit of solitude had\ngiven him a passion for the printed page, and if he could have found\na book anywhere--any kind of a book--he would have forgotten the long\nhours and the empty house. But the tables in the library held only\nmassive unused inkstands and immense immaculate blotters; not a single\nvolume had slipped its golden prison.\n\nHis loneliness had grown overwhelming, and he suddenly thought of Mrs.\nHeeny's clippings. His mother, alarmed by an insidious gain in weight,\nhad brought the masseuse back from New York with her, and Mrs. Heeny,\nwith her old black bag and waterproof, was established in one of the\ngrand bedrooms lined with mirrors. She had been loud in her joy at\nseeing her little friend that morning, but four years had passed since\ntheir last parting, and her personality had grown remote to him. He saw\ntoo many people, and they too often disappeared and were replaced by\nothers: his scattered affections had ended by concentrating themselves\non the charming image of the gentleman he called his French father; and\nsince his French father had vanished no one else seemed to matter much\nto him.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" Mrs. Heeny had said, discerning the reluctance under his\ncivil greeting, \"I guess you're as strange here as I am, and we're both\npretty strange to each other. You just go and look round, and see what\na lovely home your Ma's got to live in; and when you get tired of that,\ncome up here to me and I'll give you a look at my clippings.\"\n\nThe word woke a train of dormant associations, and Paul saw himself\nseated on a dingy carpet, between two familiar taciturn old presences,\nwhile he rummaged in the depths of a bag stuffed with strips of\nnewspaper.\n\nHe found Mrs. Heeny sitting in a pink arm-chair, her bonnet perched on\na pink-shaded electric lamp and her numerous implements spread out on\nan immense pink toilet-table. Vague as his recollection of her was, she\ngave him at once a sense of reassurance that nothing else in the house\nconveyed, and after he had examined all her scissors and pastes and\nnail-polishers he turned to the bag, which stood on the carpet at her\nfeet as if she were waiting for a train.\n\n\"My, my!\" she said, \"do you want to get into that again? How you used to\nhunt in it for taffy, to be sure, when your Pa brought you up to Grandma\nSpragg's o' Saturdays! Well, I'm afraid there ain't any taffy in it now;\nbut there's piles and piles of lovely new clippings you ain't seen.\"\n\n\"My Papa?\" He paused, his hand among the strips of newspaper. \"My Papa\nnever saw my Grandma Spragg. He never went to America.\"\n\n\"Never went to America? Your Pa never--? Why, land alive!\" Mrs. Heeny\ngasped, a blush empurpling her large warm face. \"Why, Paul Marvell,\ndon't you remember your own father, you that bear his name?\" she\nexclaimed.\n\nThe boy blushed also, conscious that it must have been wrong to forget,\nand yet not seeing how he was to blame.\n\n\"That one died a long long time ago, didn't he? I was thinking of my\nFrench father,\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh, mercy,\" ejaculated Mrs. Heeny; and as if to cut the conversation\nshort she stooped over, creaking like a ship, and thrust her plump\nstrong hand into the bag.\n\n\"Here, now, just you look at these clippings--I guess you'll find a lot\nin them about your Ma.--Where do they come from? Why, out of the papers,\nof course,\" she added, in response to Paul's enquiry. \"You'd oughter\nstart a scrap-book yourself--you're plenty old enough. You could make\na beauty just about your Ma, with her picture pasted in the front--and\nanother about Mr. Moffatt and his collections. There's one I cut out the\nother day that says he's the greatest collector in America.\"\n\nPaul listened, fascinated. He had the feeling that Mrs. Heeny's\nclippings, aside from their great intrinsic interest, might furnish him\nthe clue to many things he didn't understand, and that nobody had ever\nhad time to explain to him. His mother's marriages, for instance: he was\nsure there was a great deal to find out about them. But she always said:\n\"I'll tell you all about it when I come back\"--and when she came back it\nwas invariably to rush off somewhere else. So he had remained without\na key to her transitions, and had had to take for granted numberless\nthings that seemed to have no parallel in the experience of the other\nboys he knew.\n\n\"Here--here it is,\" said Mrs. Heeny, adjusting the big tortoiseshell\nspectacles she had taken to wearing, and reading out in a slow chant\nthat seemed to Paul to come out of some lost remoteness of his infancy.\n\n\"'It is reported in London that the price paid by Mr. Elmer Moffatt for\nthe celebrated Grey Boy is the largest sum ever given for a Vandyck.\nSince Mr. Moffatt began to buy extensively it is estimated in art\ncircles that values have gone up at least seventy-five per cent.'\"\n\nBut the price of the Grey Boy did not interest Paul, and he said a\nlittle impatiently: \"I'd rather hear about my mother.\"\n\n\"To be sure you would! You wait now.\" Mrs. Heeny made another dive, and\nagain began to spread her clippings on her lap like cards on a big black\ntable.\n\n\"Here's one about her last portrait--no, here's a better one about\nher pearl necklace, the one Mr. Moffatt gave her last Christmas. 'The\nnecklace, which was formerly the property of an Austrian Archduchess, is\ncomposed of five hundred perfectly matched pearls that took thirty years\nto collect. It is estimated among dealers in precious stones that since\nMr. Moffatt began to buy the price of pearls has gone up over fifty per\ncent.'\"\n\nEven this did not fix Paul's attention. He wanted to hear about his\nmother and Mr. Moffatt, and not about their things; and he didn't quite\nknow how to frame his question. But Mrs. Heeny looked kindly at him and\nhe tried. \"Why is mother married to Mr. Moffatt now?\"\n\n\"Why, you must know that much, Paul.\" Mrs. Heeny again looked warm and\nworried. \"She's married to him because she got a divorce--that's why.\"\nAnd suddenly she had another inspiration. \"Didn't she ever send you\nover any of those splendid clippings that came out the time they were\nmarried? Why, I declare, that's a shame; but I must have some of 'em\nright here.\"\n\nShe dived again, shuffled, sorted, and pulled out a long discoloured\nstrip. \"I've carried this round with me ever since, and so many's wanted\nto read it, it's all torn.\" She smoothed out the paper and began:\n\n\"'Divorce and remarriage of Mrs. Undine Spragg-de Chelles. American\nMarquise renounces ancient French title to wed Railroad King. Quick work\nuntying and tying. Boy and girl romance renewed. \"'Reno, November 23d.\nThe Marquise de Chelles, of Paris, France, formerly Mrs. Undine Spragg\nMarvell, of Apex City and New York, got a decree of divorce at a special\nsession of the Court last night, and was remarried fifteen minutes\nlater to Mr. Elmer Moffatt, the billionaire Railroad King, who was the\nMarquise's first husband.\n\n\"'No case has ever been railroaded through the divorce courts of this\nState at a higher rate of speed: as Mr. Moffatt said last night, before\nhe and his bride jumped onto their east-bound special, every record has\nbeen broken. It was just six months ago yesterday that the present Mrs.\nMoffatt came to Reno to look for her divorce. Owing to a delayed train,\nher counsel was late yesterday in receiving some necessary papers, and\nit was feared the decision would have to be held over; but Judge Toomey,\nwho is a personal friend of Mr. Moffatt's, held a night session and\nrushed it through so that the happy couple could have the knot tied and\nboard their special in time for Mrs. Moffatt to spend Thanksgiving in\nNew York with her aged parents. The hearing began at seven ten p. m. and\nat eight o'clock the bridal couple were steaming out of the station.\n\n\"'At the trial Mrs. Spragg-de Chelles, who wore copper velvet and\nsables, gave evidence as to the brutality of her French husband, but she\nhad to talk fast as time pressed, and Judge Toomey wrote the entry at\ntop speed, and then jumped into a motor with the happy couple and\ndrove to the Justice of the Peace, where he acted as best man to the\nbridegroom. The latter is said to be one of the six wealthiest men\neast of the Rockies. His gifts to the bride are a necklace and tiara\nof pigeon-blood rubies belonging to Queen Marie Antoinette, a million\ndollar cheque and a house in New York. The happy pair will pass the\nhoneymoon in Mrs. Moffatt's new home, 5009 Fifth Avenue, which is an\nexact copy of the Pitti Palace, Florence. They plan to spend their\nsprings in France.'\"\n\nMrs. Heeny drew a long breath, folded the paper and took off her\nspectacles. \"There,\" she said, with a benignant smile and a tap on\nPaul's cheek, \"now you see how it all happened....\"\n\nPaul was not sure he did; but he made no answer. His mind was too full\nof troubled thoughts. In the dazzling description of his mother's latest\nnuptials one fact alone stood out for him--that she had said things that\nweren't true of his French father. Something he had half-guessed in her,\nand averted his frightened thoughts from, took his little heart in an\niron grasp. She said things that weren't true.... That was what he had\nalways feared to find out.... She had got up and said before a lot of\npeople things that were awfully false about his dear French father....\n\nThe sound of a motor turning in at the gates made Mrs. Heeny exclaim\n\"Here they are!\" and a moment later Paul heard his mother calling to\nhim. He got up reluctantly, and stood wavering till he felt Mrs. Heeny's\nastonished eye upon him. Then he heard Mr. Moffatt's jovial shout of\n\"Paul Marvell, ahoy there!\" and roused himself to run downstairs.\n\nAs he reached the landing he saw that the ballroom doors were open and\nall the lustres lit. His mother and Mr. Moffatt stood in the middle\nof the shining floor, looking up at the walls; and Paul's heart gave\na wondering bound, for there, set in great gilt panels, were the\ntapestries that had always hung in the gallery at Saint Desert.\n\n\"Well, Senator, it feels good to shake your fist again!\" his step-father\nsaid, taking him in a friendly grasp; and his mother, who looked\nhandsomer and taller and more splendidly dressed than ever, exclaimed:\n\"Mercy! how they've cut his hair!\" before she bent to kiss him.\n\n\"Oh, mother, mother!\" he burst out, feeling, between his mother's face\nand the others, hardly less familiar, on the walls, that he was really\nat home again, and not in a strange house.\n\n\"Gracious, how you squeeze!\" she protested, loosening his arms. \"But\nyou look splendidly--and how you've grown!\" She turned away from him and\nbegan to inspect the tapestries critically. \"Somehow they look smaller\nhere,\" she said with a tinge of disappointment.\n\nMr. Moffatt gave a slight laugh and walked slowly down the room, as if\nto study its effect. As he turned back his wife said: \"I didn't think\nyou'd ever get them.\" He laughed again, more complacently. \"Well, I\ndon't know as I ever should have, if General Arlington hadn't happened\nto bust up.\"\n\nThey both smiled, and Paul, seeing his mother's softened face, stole his\nhand in hers and began: \"Mother, I took a prize in composition--\"\n\n\"Did you? You must tell me about it to-morrow. No, I really must rush\noff now and dress--I haven't even placed the dinner-cards.\" She freed\nher hand, and as she turned to go Paul heard Mr. Moffatt say: \"Can't you\never give him a minute's time, Undine?\"\n\nShe made no answer, but sailed through the door with her head high, as\nshe did when anything annoyed her; and Paul and his step-father stood\nalone in the illuminated ball-room.\n\nMr. Moffatt smiled good-naturedly at the little boy and then turned back\nto the contemplation of the hangings.\n\n\"I guess you know where those come from, don't you?\" he asked in a tone\nof satisfaction.\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" Paul answered eagerly, with a hope he dared not utter that,\nsince the tapestries were there, his French father might be coming too.\n\n\"You're a smart boy to remember them. I don't suppose you ever thought\nyou'd see them here?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Paul, embarrassed.\n\n\"Well, I guess you wouldn't have if their owner hadn't been in a pretty\ntight place. It was like drawing teeth for him to let them go.\"\n\nPaul flushed up, and again the iron grasp was on his heart. He hadn't,\nhitherto, actually disliked Mr. Moffatt, who was always in a good\nhumour, and seemed less busy and absent-minded than his mother; but at\nthat instant he felt a rage of hate for him. He turned away and burst\ninto tears.\n\n\"Why, hullo, old chap--why, what's up?\" Mr. Moffatt was on his knees\nbeside the boy, and the arms embracing him were firm and friendly. But\nPaul, for the life of him, couldn't answer: he could only sob and sob as\nthe great surges of loneliness broke over him.\n\n\"Is it because your mother hadn't time for you? Well, she's like that,\nyou know; and you and I have got to lump it,\" Mr. Moffatt continued,\ngetting to his feet. He stood looking down at the boy with a queer\nsmile. \"If we two chaps stick together it won't be so bad--we can keep\neach other warm, don't you see? I like you first rate, you know; when\nyou're big enough I mean to put you in my business. And it looks as if\none of these days you'd be the richest boy in America....\"\n\nThe lamps were lit, the vases full of flowers, the foot-men assembled\non the landing and in the vestibule below, when Undine descended to the\ndrawing-room. As she passed the ballroom door she glanced in approvingly\nat the tapestries. They really looked better than she had been willing\nto admit: they made her ballroom the handsomest in Paris. But something\nhad put her out on the way up from Deauville, and the simplest way of\neasing her nerves had been to affect indifference to the tapestries.\nNow she had quite recovered her good humour, and as she glanced down\nthe list of guests she was awaiting she said to herself, with a sigh of\nsatisfaction, that she was glad she had put on her rubies.\n\nFor the first time since her marriage to Moffatt she was about to\nreceive in her house the people she most wished to see there. The\nbeginnings had been a little difficult; their first attempt in New York\nwas so unpromising that she feared they might not be able to live\ndown the sensational details of their reunion, and had insisted on\nher husband's taking her back to Paris. But her apprehensions were\nunfounded. It was only necessary to give people the time to pretend they\nhad forgotten; and already they were all pretending beautifully. The\nFrench world had of course held out longest; it had strongholds she\nmight never capture. But already seceders were beginning to show\nthemselves, and her dinner-list that evening was graced with the names\nof an authentic Duke and a not too-damaged Countess. In addition, of\ncourse, she had the Shallums, the Chauncey Ellings, May Beringer, Dicky\nBowles, Walsingham Popple, and the rest of the New York frequenters of\nthe Nouveau Luxe; she had even, at the last minute, had the amusement of\nadding Peter Van Degen to their number. In the evening there were to be\nSpanish dancing and Russian singing; and Dicky Bowles had promised her\na Grand Duke for her next dinner, if she could secure the new tenor who\nalways refused to sing in private houses.\n\nEven now, however, she was not always happy. She had everything she\nwanted, but she still felt, at times, that there were other things she\nmight want if she knew about them. And there had been moments lately\nwhen she had had to confess to herself that Moffatt did not fit into the\npicture. At first she had been dazzled by his success and subdued by his\nauthority. He had given her all she had ever wished for, and more\nthan she had ever dreamed of having: he had made up to her for all her\nfailures and blunders, and there were hours when she still felt his\ndominion and exulted in it. But there were others when she saw his\ndefects and was irritated by them: when his loudness and redness, his\nmisplaced joviality, his familiarity with the servants, his alternating\nswagger and ceremony with her friends, jarred on perceptions that had\ndeveloped in her unawares. Now and then she caught herself thinking\nthat his two predecessors--who were gradually becoming merged in her\nmemory--would have said this or that differently, behaved otherwise in\nsuch and such a case. And the comparison was almost always to Moffatt's\ndisadvantage.\n\nThis evening, however, she thought of him indulgently. She was pleased\nwith his clever stroke in capturing the Saint Desert tapestries, which\nGeneral Arlington's sudden bankruptcy, and a fresh gambling scandal of\nHubert's, had compelled their owner to part with. She knew that Raymond\nde Chelles had told the dealers he would sell his tapestries to anyone\nbut Mr. Elmer Moffatt, or a buyer acting for him; and it amused her to\nthink that, thanks to Elmer's astuteness, they were under her roof after\nall, and that Raymond and all his clan were by this time aware of it.\nThese facts disposed her favourably toward her husband, and deepened the\nsense of well-being with which--according to her invariable habit--she\nwalked up to the mirror above the mantelpiece and studied the image it\nreflected.\n\nShe was still lost in this pleasing contemplation when her husband\nentered, looking stouter and redder than ever, in evening clothes that\nwere a little too tight. His shirt front was as glossy as his baldness,\nand in his buttonhole he wore the red ribbon bestowed on him for waiving\nhis claim to a Velasquez that was wanted for the Louvre. He carried\na newspaper in his hand, and stood looking about the room with a\ncomplacent eye.\n\n\"Well, I guess this is all right,\" he said, and she answered briefly:\n\"Don't forget you're to take down Madame de Follerive; and for goodness'\nsake don't call her 'Countess.'\"\n\n\"Why, she is one, ain't she?\" he returned good-humouredly.\n\n\"I wish you'd put that newspaper away,\" she continued; his habit of\nleaving old newspapers about the drawing-room annoyed her.\n\n\"Oh, that reminds me--\" instead of obeying her he unfolded the paper.\n\"I brought it in to show you something. Jim Driscoll's been appointed\nAmbassador to England.\"\n\n\"Jim Driscoll--!\" She caught up the paper and stared at the paragraph\nhe pointed to. Jim Driscoll--that pitiful nonentity, with his stout\nmistrustful commonplace wife! It seemed extraordinary that the\ngovernment should have hunted up such insignificant people. And\nimmediately she had a great vague vision of the splendours they were\ngoing to--all the banquets and ceremonies and precedences....\n\n\"I shouldn't say she'd want to, with so few jewels--\" She dropped the\npaper and turned to her husband. \"If you had a spark of ambition, that's\nthe kind of thing you'd try for. You could have got it just as easily as\nnot!\"\n\nHe laughed and thrust his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes with the\ngesture she disliked. \"As it happens, it's about the one thing I\ncouldn't.\"\n\n\"You couldn't? Why not?\"\n\n\"Because you're divorced. They won't have divorced Ambassadresses.\"\n\n\"They won't? Why not, I'd like to know?\"\n\n\"Well, I guess the court ladies are afraid there'd be too many pretty\nwomen in the Embassies,\" he answered jocularly.\n\nShe burst into an angry laugh, and the blood flamed up into her face.\n\"I never heard of anything so insulting!\" she cried, as if the rule had\nbeen invented to humiliate her.\n\nThere was a noise of motors backing and advancing in the court, and she\nheard the first voices on the stairs. She turned to give herself a last\nlook in the glass, saw the blaze of her rubies, the glitter of her hair,\nand remembered the brilliant names on her list.\n\nBut under all the dazzle a tiny black cloud remained. She had learned\nthat there was something she could never get, something that neither\nbeauty nor influence nor millions could ever buy for her. She could\nnever be an Ambassador's wife; and as she advanced to welcome her first\nguests she said to herself that it was the one part she was really made\nfor.\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Custom of the Country, by Edith Wharton\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CUSTOM OF THE COUNTRY ***\n\n***** This file should be named 11052-8.txt or 11052-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/1\/0\/5\/11052\/\n\nProduced by Steve Harris and PG Distributed Proofreaders\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain\nfreely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To\nlearn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and\nhow your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\nFoundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state\nof Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue\nService. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number\nis 64-6221541. Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby Chief Executive\nand Director gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\nincluding including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\nare filed in directories based on their release date. If you want to\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just download\nby the etext year.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/etext06\n\n(Or \/etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92,\n91 or 90)\n\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\nfiled in a different way. The year of a release date is no longer part\nof the directory path. The path is based on the etext number (which is\nidentical to the filename). The path to the file is made up of single\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename. For\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/1\/0\/2\/3\/10234\n\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/2\/4\/6\/8\/24689\n\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/GUTINDEX.ALL\n\n\n","id":626,"split":"train"}
