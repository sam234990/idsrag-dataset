TEIGNMOUTH SHORE\n\n\n\nANTHONY TROLLOPE\n\nBorn London, April 24, 1815 Died London, December 6, 1882\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThere is the proper mood and the just environment for the reading as\nwell as for the writing of works of fiction, and there can be no better\nplace for the enjoying of a novel by Anthony Trollope than under a tree\nin Kensington Gardens of a summer day. Under a tree in the avenue that\nreaches down from the Round Pond to the Long Water. There, perhaps more\nthan anywhere else, lingers the early Victorian atmosphere. As we sit\nbeneath our tree, we see in the distance the dun, red-brick walls of\nKensington Palace, where one night Princess Victoria was awakened to\nhear that she was Queen; there in quaint, hideously ugly Victorian\nrooms are to be seen Victorian dolls and other playthings; the whole\nenvironment is early Victorian. Here to the mind's eye how easy it is to\nconjure up ghosts of men in baggy trousers and long flowing whiskers, of\nprim women in crinolines, in hats with long trailing feathers and\nwith ridiculous little parasols, or with Grecian-bends and\nchignons--church-parading to and fro beneath the trees or by the water's\nedge--perchance, even the fascinating Lady Crinoline and the elegant Mr.\nMacassar Jones, whose history has been written by Clerk Charley in the\npages we are introducing to the 'gentle reader'. As a poetaster of an\nearlier date has written:--\n\n  Where Kensington high o'er the neighbouring lands\n  'Midst green and sweets, a royal fabric, stands,\n  And sees each spring, luxuriant in her bowers,\n  A snow of blossoms, and a wild of flowers,\n  The dames of Britain oft in crowds repair\n  To gravel walks, and unpolluted air.\n  Here, while the town in damps and darkness lies,\n  They breathe in sunshine, and see azure skies;\n  Each walk, with robes of various dyes bespread,\n  Seems from afar a moving tulip bed,\n  Where rich brocades and glossy damasks glow,\n  And chintz, the rival of the showery bow.\n\nIndeed, the historian of social manners, when dealing with the Victorian\nperiod, will perforce have recourse to the early volumes of Punch and to\nthe novels of Thackeray, Dickens, and Trollope.\n\nThere are certain authors of whom personally we know little, but of\nwhose works we cannot ever know enough, such a one for example as\nShakespeare; others of whose lives we know much, but for whose works\nwe can have but scant affection: such is Doctor Johnson; others who are\nintimate friends in all their aspects, as Goldsmith and Charles Lamb;\nyet others, who do not quite come home to our bosoms, whose writings we\ncannot entirely approve, but for whom and for whose works we find a soft\nplace somewhere in our hearts, and such a one is Anthony Trollope. His\nnovels are not for every-day reading, any more than are those of Marryat\nand Borrow--to take two curious examples. There are times and moods and\nplaces in which it would be quite impossible to read _The Three Clerks_;\nothers in which this story is almost wholly delightful. With those who\nare fond of bed-reading Trollope should ever be a favourite, and it is\nno small compliment to say this, for small is the noble army of authors\nwho have given us books which can enchant in the witching hour between\nwaking and slumber. It is probable that all lovers of letters have their\nfavourite bed-books. Thackeray has charmingly told us of his. Of the few\nnovels that can really be enjoyed when the reader is settling down for\nslumber almost all have been set forth by writers who--consciously or\nunconsciously--have placed character before plot; Thackeray himself,\nMiss Austen, Borrow, Marryat, Sterne, Dickens, Goldsmith and--Trollope.\n\nBooks are very human in their way, as what else should they be, children\nof men and women as they are? Just as with human friends so with book\nfriends, first impressions are often misleading; good literary coin\nsometimes seems to ring untrue, but the untruth is in the ear of the\nreader, not of the writer. For instance, Trollope has many odd and\nirritating tricks which are apt to scare off those who lack perseverance\nand who fail to understand that there must be something admirable\nin that which was once much admired by the judicious. He shares with\nThackeray the sinful habit of pulling up his readers with a wrench by\nreminding them that what is set before them is after all mere fiction\nand that the characters in whose fates they are becoming interested\nare only marionettes. With Dickens and others he shares the custom, so\nirritating to us of to-day, of ticketing his personages with clumsy,\ndescriptive labels, such as, in _The Three Clerks_, Mr. Chaffanbrass,\nSir Gregory Hardlines, Sir Warwick West End, Mr. Neverbend, Mr. Whip\nVigil, Mr. Nogo and Mr. Gitemthruet. He must plead guilty, also, to some\nbad ways peculiarly his own, or which he made so by the thoroughness\nwith which he indulged in them. He moralizes in his own person in\ndeplorable manner: is not this terrible:--'Poor Katie!--dear, darling,\nbonnie Katie!--sweet, sweetest, dearest child! why, oh, why, has that\nmother of thine, that tender-hearted loving mother, put thee unguarded\nin the way of such perils as this? Has she not sworn to herself that\nover thee at least she would watch as a hen over her young, so that no\nunfortunate love should quench thy young spirit, or blanch thy cheek's\nbloom?' Is this not sufficient to make the gentlest reader swear to\nhimself?\n\nFortunately this and some other appalling passages occur after the story\nis in full swing and after the three Clerks and those with whom\nthey come into contact have proved themselves thoroughly interesting\ncompanions. Despite all his old-fashioned tricks Trollope does\nundoubtedly succeed in giving blood and life to most of his characters;\nthey are not as a rule people of any great eccentricity or of profound\nemotions; but ordinary, every-day folk, such as all of us have met,\nand loved or endured. Trollope fills very adequately a space between\nThackeray and Dickens, of whom the former deals for the most part with\nthe upper 'ten', the latter with the lower 'ten'; Trollope with the\nsuburban and country-town 'ten'; the three together giving us a very\ncomplete and detailed picture of the lives led by our grandmothers and\ngrandfathers, whose hearts were in the same place as our own, but whose\nmanners of speech, of behaviour and of dress have now entered into the\nvague region known as the 'days of yore'.\n\n_The Three Clerks_ is an excellent example of Trollope's handiwork. The\ndevelopment of the plot is sufficiently skilful to maintain the reader's\ninterest, and the major part of the characters is lifelike, always\nwell observed and sometimes depicted with singular skill and insight.\nTrollope himself liked the work well:--\n\n'The plot is not so good as that of _The Macdermots_; nor are any\ncharacters in the book equal to those of Mrs. Proudie and the Warden;\nbut the work has a more continued interest, and contains the first\nwell-described love-scene that I ever wrote. The passage in which Kate\nWoodward, thinking she will die, tries to take leave of the lad she\nloves, still brings tears to my eyes when I read it. I had not the heart\nto kill her. I never could do that. And I do not doubt that they are\nliving happily together to this day.\n\n'The lawyer Chaffanbrass made his first appearance in this novel, and I\ndo not think that I have cause to be ashamed of him. But this novel\nnow is chiefly noticeable to me from the fact that in it I introduced a\ncharacter under the name of Sir Gregory Hardlines, by which I intended\nto lean very heavily on that much loathed scheme of competitive\nexamination, of which at that time Sir Charles Trevelyan was the\ngreat apostle. Sir Gregory Hardlines was intended for Sir Charles\nTrevelyan--as any one at the time would know who had taken an interest\nin the Civil Service. 'We always call him Sir Gregory,' Lady Trevelyan\nsaid to me afterwards when I came to know her husband. I never learned\nto love competitive examination; but I became, and am, very fond of Sir\nCharles Trevelyan. Sir Stafford Northcote, who is now Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, was then leagued with his friend Sir Charles, and he too\nappears in _The Three Clerks_ under the feebly facetious name of Sir\nWarwick West End. But for all that _The Three Clerks_ was a good novel.'\n\nWhich excerpt from Trollope's _Autobiography_ serves to throw light\nnot only upon the novel in question, but also upon the character of its\nauthor.\n\nTrollope served honestly and efficiently for many a long year in the\nPost Office, achieving his entrance through a farce of an examination:--\n\n'The story of that examination', he says, 'is given accurately in the\nopening chapters of a novel written by me, called _The Three Clerks_.\nIf any reader of this memoir would refer to that chapter and see how\nCharley Tudor was supposed to have been admitted into the Internal\nNavigation Office, that reader will learn how Anthony Trollope was\nactually admitted into the Secretary's office of the General Post Office\nin 1834.'\n\nPoe's description of the manner in which he wrote _The Raven_ is\nincredible, being probably one of his solemn and sombre jokes; equally\nincredible is Trollope's confession of his humdrum, mechanical methods\nof work. Doubtless he believed he was telling the whole truth, but only\nhere and there in his _Autobiography_ does he permit to peep out touches\nof light, which complete the portrait of himself. It is impossible that\nfor the reader any character in fiction should live which has not been\nalive to its creator; so is it with Trollope, who, speaking of his\ncharacters, says,\n\n'I have wandered alone among the rooks and woods, crying at their grief,\nlaughing at their absurdities, and thoroughly enjoying their joy. I\nhave been impregnated with my own creations till it has been my only\nexcitement to sit with the pen in my hand, and drive my team before me\nat as quick a pace as I could make them travel.'\n\nThere is a plain matter-of-factness about Trollope's narratives which is\nconvincing, making it difficult for the reader to call himself back to\nfact and to remember that he has been wandering in a world of fiction.\nIn _The Three Clerks_, the young men who give the tale its title are all\nwell drawn. To accomplish this in the cases of Alaric and Charley Tudor\nwas easy enough for a skilled writer, but to breathe life into Harry\nNorman was difficult. At first he appears to be a lay-figure, a priggish\ndummy of an immaculate hero, a failure in portraiture; but toward the\nend of the book it is borne in on us that our dislike had been aroused\nby the lifelike nature of the painting, dislike toward a real man,\npriggish indeed in many ways, but with a very human strain of obstinacy\nand obdurateness, which few writers would have permitted to have entered\ninto the make-up of any of their heroes. Of the other men, Undy Scott\nmay be named as among the very best pieces of portraiture in Victorian\nfiction; touch after touch of detail is added to the picture with really\nadmirable skill, and Undy lives in the reader's memory as vividly as\nhe must have existed in the imagination of his creator. There are some\nstrong and curious passages in Chapter XLIV, in which the novelist\ncontrasts the lives and fates of Varney, Bill Sykes and Undy Scott; they\nstir the blood, proving uncontestibly that Undy Scott was as real to\nTrollope as he is to us: 'The figure of Undy swinging from a gibbet at\nthe broad end of Lombard Street would have an effect. Ah, my fingers\nitch to be at the rope.'\n\nTrollope possessed the rare and beautiful gift of painting the hearts\nand souls of young girls, and of this power he has given an admirable\nexample in Katie Woodward. It would be foolish and cruel to attempt to\nepitomize, or rather to draw in miniature, this portrait that Trollope\nhas drawn at full length; were it not for any other end, those that are\nfond of all that is graceful and charming in young womanhood should read\n_The Three Clerks_, so becoming the friend, nay, the lover of Katie. Her\nsisters are not so attractive, simply because nature did not make them\nso; a very fine, faithful woman, Gertrude; a dear thing, Linda. All\nthree worthy of their mother, she who, as we are told in a delicious\nphrase, 'though adverse to a fool' 'could sympathize with folly '.\n\nThese eight portraits are grouped in the foreground of this\n'conversation' piece, the background being filled with slighter but\nalways live figures.\n\nParticularly striking, as being somewhat unusual with Trollope, is the\ndepiction of the public-house, 'The Pig and Whistle', in Norfolk Street,\nthe landlady, Mrs. Davis, and the barmaid, Norah Geraghty. We can almost\nsmell the gin, the effluvia of stale beer, the bad tobacco, hear\nthe simpers and see the sidlings of Norah, feel sick with and at\nCharley:--he 'got up and took her hand; and as he did so, he saw that\nher nails were dirty. He put his arms round her waist and kissed her;\nand as he caressed her, his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum\nin her hair was none of the best ... and then he felt very sick'. But,\noh, why 'olfactory nerves'? Was it vulgar in early Victorian days to\ncall a nose a nose?\n\nHow far different would have been Dickens's treatment of such characters\nand such a scene; out of Mrs. Davis and Norah he would have extracted\nfun, and it would never have entered into his mind to have brought such\na man as Charley into contact with them in a manner that must hurt that\nyoung hero's susceptibilities. Thackeray would have followed a third\nway, judging by his treatment of the Fotheringay and Captain Costigan,\npartly humorous, partly satirical, partly serious.\n\nTrollope was not endowed with any spark of wit, his satire tends towards\nthe obvious, and his humour is mild, almost unconscious, as if he could\ndepict for us what of the humorous came under his observation without\nhimself seeing the fun in it. Where he sets forth with intent to be\nhumorous he sometimes attains almost to the tragic; there are few things\nso sad as a joke that misses fire or a jester without sense of humour.\n\nOf the genius of a writer of fiction there is scarce any other test so\nsure as this of the reality of his characters. Few are the authors that\nhave created for us figures of fiction that are more alive to us than\nthe historic shadows of the past, whose dead bones historians do not\nseem to be able to clothe with flesh and blood. Trollope hovers on the\nborder line between genius and great talent, or rather it would be more\nfair to say that with regard to him opinions may justly differ. For\nour own part we hold that his was not talent streaked with genius, but\nrather a jog-trot genius alloyed with mediocrity. He lacked the supreme\nunconsciousness of supreme genius, for of genius as of talent there are\ndegrees. There are characters in _The Three Clerks_ that live; those\nwho have read the tale must now and again when passing Norfolk Street,\nStrand, regret that it would be waste of time to turn down that rebuilt\nthoroughfare in search of 'The Pig and Whistle', which was 'one of these\nsmall tranquil shrines of Bacchus in which the god is worshipped with as\nconstant a devotion, though with less noisy demonstration of zeal than\nin his larger and more public temples'. Alas; lovers of Victorian\nLondon must lament that such shrines grow fewer day by day; the great\nthoroughfares know them no more; they hide nervously in old-world\ncorners, and in them you will meet old-world characters, who not seldom\nseem to have lost themselves on their way to the pages of Charles\nDickens.\n\nDespite the advent of electric tramways, Hampton would still be\nrecognized by the three clerks, 'the little village of Hampton, with its\nold-fashioned country inn, and its bright, quiet, grassy river.' Hampton\nis now as it then was, the 'well-loved resort of cockneydom'.\n\nSo let us alight from the tramcar at Hampton, and look about on the\noutskirts of the village for 'a small old-fashioned brick house,\nabutting on the road, but looking from its front windows on to a lawn\nand garden, which stretched down to the river'. Surbiton Cottage it is\ncalled. Let us peep in at that merry, happy family party; and laugh at\nCaptain Cuttwater, waking from his placid sleep, rubbing his eyes in\nwonderment, and asking, 'What the devil is all the row about?' But it is\nonly with our mind's eye that we can see Surbiton Cottage--a cottage\nin the air it is, but more substantial to some of us than many a real\njerry-built villa of red brick and stucco.\n\nOld-fashioned seem to us the folk who once dwelt there, old-fashioned in\nall save that their hearts were true and their outlook on life sane and\nclean; they live still, though their clothes be of a quaint fashion and\ntheir talk be of yesterday.\n\nWho knows but that they will live long after we who love them shall be\ndead and turned to dust?\n\nW.

CONCLUSION\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES\n\n\nAll the English world knows, or knows of, that branch of the Civil\nService which is popularly called the Weights and Measures. Every\ninhabitant of London, and every casual visitor there, has admired the\nhandsome edifice which generally goes by that name, and which stands so\nconspicuously confronting the Treasury Chambers. It must be owned that\nwe have but a slip-slop way of christening our public buildings. When a\nman tells us that he called on a friend at the Horse Guards, or looked\nin at the Navy Pay, or dropped a ticket at the Woods and Forests, we put\nup with the accustomed sounds, though they are in themselves, perhaps,\nindefensible. The 'Board of Commissioners for Regulating Weights and\nMeasures', and the 'Office of the Board of Commissioners for Regulating\nWeights and Measures', are very long phrases; and as, in the course of\nthis tale, frequent mention will be made of the public establishment in\nquestion, the reader's comfort will be best consulted by maintaining its\npopular though improper denomination.\n\nIt is generally admitted that the Weights and Measures is a\nwell-conducted public office; indeed, to such a degree of efficiency has\nit been brought by its present very excellent secretary, the two\nvery worthy assistant-secretaries, and especially by its late most\nrespectable chief clerk, that it may be said to stand quite alone as\na high model for all other public offices whatever. It is exactly\nantipodistic of the Circumlocution Office, and as such is always\nreferred to in the House of Commons by the gentleman representing the\nGovernment when any attack on the Civil Service, generally, is being\nmade.\n\nAnd when it is remembered how great are the interests entrusted to the\ncare of this board, and of these secretaries and of that chief clerk, it\nmust be admitted that nothing short of superlative excellence ought to\nsuffice the nation. All material intercourse between man and man must be\nregulated, either justly or unjustly, by weights and measures; and as we\nof all people depend most on such material intercourse, our weights and\nmeasures should to us be a source of never-ending concern. And then that\nquestion of the decimal coinage! is it not in these days of paramount\nimportance? Are we not disgraced by the twelve pennies in our\nshilling, by the four farthings in our penny? One of the worthy\nassistant-secretaries, the worthier probably of the two, has already\ngrown pale beneath the weight of this question. But he has sworn within\nhimself, with all the heroism of a Nelson, that he will either do or\ndie. He will destroy the shilling or the shilling shall destroy him.\nIn his more ardent moods he thinks that he hears the noise of battle\nbooming round him, and talks to his wife of Westminster Abbey or a\npeerage. Then what statistical work of the present age has shown half\nthe erudition contained in that essay lately published by the secretary\non _The Market Price of Coined Metals_? What other living man could have\ncompiled that chronological table which is appended to it, showing the\ncomparative value of the metallic currency for the last three hundred\nyears? Compile it indeed! What other secretary or assistant-secretary\nbelonging to any public office of the present day, could even read it\nand live? It completely silenced Mr. Muntz for a session, and even _The\nTimes_ was afraid to review it.\n\nSuch a state of official excellence has not, however, been obtained\nwithout its drawbacks, at any rate in the eyes of the unambitious tyros\nand unfledged novitiates of the establishment. It is a very fine thing\nto be pointed out by envying fathers as a promising clerk in the\nWeights and Measures, and to receive civil speeches from mammas with\nmarriageable daughters. But a clerk in the Weights and Measures is soon\nmade to understand that it is not for him to--\n\n  Sport with Amaryllis in the shade.\n\nIt behoves him that his life should be grave and his pursuits laborious,\nif he intends to live up to the tone of those around him. And as,\nsitting there at his early desk, his eyes already dim with figures, he\nsees a jaunty dandy saunter round the opposite corner to the Council\nOffice at eleven o'clock, he cannot but yearn after the pleasures of\nidleness.\n\n  Were it not better done, as others use?\n\nhe says or sighs. But then comes Phoebus in the guise of the chief\nclerk, and touches his trembling ears--\n\n  As he pronounces lastly on each deed,\n  Of so much fame, in Downing Street--expect the meed.\n\nAnd so the high tone of the office is maintained.\n\nSuch is the character of the Weights and Measures at this present period\nof which we are now treating. The exoteric crowd of the Civil Service,\nthat is, the great body of clerks attached to other offices, regard\ntheir brethren of the Weights as prigs and pedants, and look on them\nmuch as a master's favourite is apt to be regarded by other boys at\nschool. But this judgement is an unfair one. Prigs and pedants, and\nhypocrites too, there are among them, no doubt--but there are also among\nthem many stirred by an honourable ambition to do well for their country\nand themselves, and to two such men the reader is now requested to\npermit himself to be introduced.\n\nHenry Norman, the senior of the two, is the second son of a gentleman\nof small property in the north of England. He was educated at a public\nschool, and thence sent to Oxford; but before he had finished his\nfirst year at Brasenose his father was obliged to withdraw him from it,\nfinding himself unable to bear the expense of a university education for\nhis two sons. His elder son at Cambridge was extravagant; and as, at\nthe critical moment when decision became necessary, a nomination in\nthe Weights and Measures was placed at his disposal, old Mr. Norman\ncommitted the not uncommon injustice of preferring the interests of his\nelder but faulty son to those of the younger with whom no fault had been\nfound, and deprived his child of the chance of combining the glories and\nhappiness of a double first, a fellow, a college tutor, and a don.\n\nWhether Harry Norman gained or lost most by the change we need not now\nconsider, but at the age of nineteen he left Oxford and entered on his\nnew duties. It must not, however, be supposed that this was a step which\nhe took without difficulty and without pause. It is true that the grand\nmodern scheme for competitive examinations had not as yet been composed.\nHad this been done, and had it been carried out, how awful must have\nbeen the cramming necessary to get a lad into the Weights and Measures!\nBut, even as things were then, it was no easy matter for a young man to\nconvince the chief clerk that he had all the acquirements necessary for\nthe high position to which he aspired.\n\nIndeed, that chief clerk was insatiable, and generally succeeded in\nmaking every candidate conceive the very lowest opinion of himself and\nhis own capacities before the examination was over. Some, of course,\nwere sent away at once with ignominy, as evidently incapable. Many\nretired in the middle of it with a conviction that they must seek their\nfortunes at the bar, or in medical pursuits, or some other comparatively\neasy walk of life. Others were rejected on the fifth or sixth day as\nbeing deficient in conic sections, or ignorant of the exact principles\nof hydraulic pressure. And even those who were retained were so\nretained, as it were, by an act of grace. The Weights and Measures was,\nand indeed is, like heaven--no man can deserve it. No candidate can\nclaim as his right to be admitted to the fruition of the appointment\nwhich has been given to him. Henry Norman, however, was found, at the\nclose of his examination, to be the least undeserving of the young men\nthen under notice, and was duly installed in his clerkship.\n\nIt need hardly be explained, that to secure so high a level of\ninformation as that required at the Weights and Measures, a scale\nof salaries equally exalted has been found necessary. Young men\nconsequently enter at \u00c2\u00a3100 a year. We are speaking, of course, of that\nmore respectable branch of the establishment called the Secretary's\nDepartment. At none other of our public offices do men commence with\nmore than \u00c2\u00a390--except, of course, at those in which political confidence\nis required. Political confidence is indeed as expensive as hydraulic\npressure, though generally found to be less difficult of attainment.\n\nHenry Norman, therefore, entered on his labours under good auspices,\nhaving \u00c2\u00a310 per annum more for the business and pleasures of life in\nLondon than most of his young brethren of the Civil Service. Whether\nthis would have sufficed of itself to enable him to live up to that tone\nof society to which he had been accustomed cannot now be surmised, as\nvery shortly after his appointment an aunt died, from whom he inherited\nsome \u00c2\u00a3150 or \u00c2\u00a3200 a year. He was, therefore, placed above all want, and\nsoon became a shining light even in that bright gallery of spiritualized\nstars which formed the corps of clerks in the Secretary's Office at the\nWeights and Measures.\n\nYoung Norman was a good-looking lad when he entered the public service,\nand in a few years he grew up to be a handsome man. He was tall and thin\nand dark, muscular in his proportions, and athletic in his habits. From\nthe date of his first enjoyment of his aunt's legacy he had a wherry on\nthe Thames, and was soon known as a man whom it was hard for an amateur\nto beat. He had a racket in a racket-court at St. John's Wood Road,\nand as soon as fortune and merit increased his salary by another \u00c2\u00a3100\na year, he usually had a nag for the season. This, however, was not\nattained till he was able to count five years' service in the Weights\nand Measures. He was, as a boy, somewhat shy and reserved in his\nmanners, and as he became older he did not shake off the fault. He\nshowed it, however, rather among men than with women, and, indeed, in\nspite of his love of exercise, he preferred the society of ladies to\nany of the bachelor gaieties of his unmarried acquaintance. He was,\nnevertheless, frank and confident in those he trusted, and true in his\nfriendships, though, considering his age, too slow in making a friend.\nSuch was Henry Norman at the time at which our tale begins. What were\nthe faults in his character it must be the business of the tale to show.\n\nThe other young clerk in this office to whom we alluded is Alaric Tudor.\nHe is a year older than Henry Norman, though he began his official\ncareer a year later, and therefore at the age of twenty-one. How it\nhappened that he contrived to pass the scrutinizing instinct and deep\npowers of examination possessed by the chief clerk, was a great wonder\nto his friends, though apparently none at all to himself. He took the\nwhole proceeding very easily; while another youth alongside of him,\nwho for a year had been reading up for his promised nomination, was so\nawe-struck by the severity of the proceedings as to lose his powers of\nmemory and forget the very essence of the differential calculus.\n\nOf hydraulic pressure and the differential calculus young Tudor knew\nnothing, and pretended to know nothing. He told the chief clerk that\nhe was utterly ignorant of all such matters, that his only acquirements\nwere a tolerably correct knowledge of English, French, and German, with\na smattering of Latin and Greek, and such an intimacy with the ordinary\nrules of arithmetic and with the first books of Euclid, as he had been\nable to pick up while acting as a tutor, rather than a scholar, in a\nsmall German university.\n\nThe chief clerk raised his eyebrows and said he feared it would not\ndo. A clerk, however, was wanting. It was very clear that the young\ngentleman who had only showed that he had forgotten his conic sections\ncould not be supposed to have passed. The austerity of the last few\nyears had deterred more young men from coming forward than the extra \u00c2\u00a310\nhad induced to do so. One unfortunate, on the failure of all his hopes,\nhad thrown himself into the Thames from the neighbouring boat-stairs;\nand though he had been hooked out uninjured by the man who always\nattends there with two wooden legs, the effect on his parents' minds had\nbeen distressing. Shortly after this occurrence the chief clerk had been\ninvited to attend the Board, and the Chairman of the Commissioners, who,\non the occasion, was of course prompted by the Secretary, recommended\nMr. Hardlines to be a _leetle_ more lenient. In doing so the quantity of\nbutter which he poured over Mr. Hardlines' head and shoulders with the\nview of alleviating the misery which such a communication would be sure\nto inflict, was very great. But, nevertheless, Mr. Hardlines came out\nfrom the Board a crestfallen and unhappy man. 'The service,' he said,\n'would go to the dogs, and might do for anything he cared, and he did\nnot mind how soon. If the Board chose to make the Weights and Measures a\nhospital for idiots, it might do so. He had done what little lay in his\npower to make the office respectable; and now, because mammas complained\nwhen their cubs of sons were not allowed to come in there and rob\nthe public and destroy the office books, he was to be thwarted and\nreprimanded! He had been,' he said, 'eight-and-twenty years in office,\nand was still in his prime--but he should,' he thought, 'take advantage\nof the advice of his medical friends, and retire. He would never remain\nthere to see the Weights and Measures become a hospital for incurables!'\n\nIt was thus that Mr. Hardlines, the chief clerk, expressed himself.\nHe did not, however, send in a medical certificate, nor apply for a\npension; and the first apparent effect of the little lecture which he\nhad received from the Chairman, was the admission into the service\nof Alaric Tudor. Mr. Hardlines was soon forced to admit that the\nappointment was not a bad one, as before his second year was over, young\nTudor had produced a very smart paper on the merits--or demerits--of the\nstrike bushel.\n\nAlaric Tudor when he entered the office was by no means so handsome a\nyouth as Harry Norman; but yet there was that in his face which was more\nexpressive, and perhaps more attractive. He was a much slighter man,\nthough equally tall. He could boast no adventitious capillary graces,\nwhereas young Norman had a pair of black curling whiskers, which\nalmost surrounded his face, and had been the delight and wonder of the\nmaidservants in his mother's house, when he returned home for his first\nofficial holiday. Tudor wore no whiskers, and his light-brown hair was\nusually cut so short as to give him something of the appearance of a\nclean Puritan. But in manners he was no Puritan; nor yet in his mode of\nlife. He was fond of society, and at an early period of his age strove\nhard to shine in it. He was ambitious; and lived with the steady aim of\nmaking the most of such advantages as fate and fortune had put in his\nway. Tudor was perhaps not superior to Norman in point of intellect; but\nhe was infinitely his superior in having early acquired a knowledge how\nbest to use such intellect as he had.\n\nHis education had been very miscellaneous, and disturbed by many causes,\nbut yet not ineffective or deficient. His father had been an officer in\na cavalry regiment, with a fair fortune, which he had nearly squandered\nin early life. He had taken Alaric when little more than an infant, and\na daughter, his only other child, to reside in Brussels. Mrs. Tudor was\nthen dead, and the remainder of the household had consisted of a French\ngoverness, a _bonne_, and a man-cook. Here Alaric remained till he\nhad perfectly acquired the French pronunciation, and very nearly as\nperfectly forgotten the English. He was then sent to a private school\nin England, where he remained till he was sixteen, returning home to\nBrussels but once during those years, when he was invited to be present\nat his sister's marriage with a Belgian banker. At the age of sixteen he\nlost his father, who, on dying, did not leave behind him enough of the\nworld's wealth to pay for his own burial. His half-pay of course died\nwith him, and young Tudor was literally destitute.\n\nHis brother-in-law, the banker, paid for his half-year's schooling\nin England, and then removed him to a German academy, at which it was\nbargained that he should teach English without remuneration, and learn\nGerman without expense. Whether he taught much English may be doubtful,\nbut he did learn German thoroughly; and in that, as in most other\ntransactions of his early life, certainly got the best of the bargain\nwhich had been made for him.\n\nAt the age of twenty he was taken to the Brussels bank as a clerk; but\nhere he soon gave visible signs of disliking the drudgery which was\nexacted from him. Not that he disliked banking. He would gladly have\nbeen a partner with ever so small a share, and would have trusted to\nhimself to increase his stake. But there is a limit to the good nature\nof brothers-in-law, even in Belgium; and Alaric was quite aware that no\nsuch good luck as this could befall him, at any rate until he had gone\nthrough many years of servile labour. His sister also, though sisterly\nenough in her disposition to him, did not quite like having a brother\nemployed as a clerk in her husband's office. They therefore put their\nheads together, and, as the Tudors had good family connexions in\nEngland, a nomination in the Weights and Measures was procured.\n\nThe nomination was procured; but when it was ascertained how very short\na way this went towards the attainment of the desired object, and how\nmuch more difficult it was to obtain Mr. Hardlines' approval than the\nBoard's favour, young Tudor's friends despaired, and recommended him to\nabandon the idea, as, should he throw himself into the Thames, he might\nperhaps fall beyond the reach of the waterman's hook. Alaric himself,\nhowever, had no such fears. He could not bring himself to conceive that\nhe could fail in being fit for a clerkship in a public office, and the\nresult of his examination proved at any rate that he had been right to\ntry.\n\nThe close of his first year's life in London found him living in\nlodgings with Henry Norman. At that time Norman's income was nearly\nthree times as good as his own. To say that Tudor selected his companion\nbecause of his income would be to ascribe unjustly to him vile motives\nand a mean instinct. He had not done so. The two young men had been\nthrown together by circumstances. They worked at the same desk, liked\neach other's society, and each being alone in the world, thereby not\nunnaturally came together. But it may probably be said that had Norman\nbeen as poor as Tudor, Tudor might probably have shrunk from rowing in\nthe same boat with him.\n\nAs it was they lived together and were fast allies; not the less so\nthat they did not agree as to many of their avocations. Tudor, at his\nfriend's solicitation, had occasionally attempted to pull an oar from\nSearle's slip to Battersea bridge. But his failure in this line was so\ncomplete, and he had to encounter so much of Norman's raillery, which\nwas endurable, and of his instruction, which was unendurable, that he\nvery soon gave up the pursuit. He was not more successful with a racket;\nand keeping a horse was of course out of the question.\n\nThey had a bond of union in certain common friends whom they much loved,\nand with whom they much associated. At least these friends soon became\ncommon to them. The acquaintance originally belonged to Norman, and he\nhad first cemented his friendship with Tudor by introducing him at the\nhouse of Mrs. Woodward. Since he had done so, the one young man was\nthere nearly as much as the other.\n\nWho and what the Woodwards were shall be told in a subsequent chapter.\nAs they have to play as important a part in the tale about to be told as\nour two friends of the Weights and Measures, it would not be becoming to\nintroduce them at the end of this.\n\nAs regards Alaric Tudor it need only be further said, by way of preface,\nof him as of Harry Norman, that the faults of his character must be made\nto declare themselves in the course of our narrative.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nTHE INTERNAL NAVIGATION\n\n\nThe London world, visitors as well as residents, are well acquainted\nalso with Somerset House; and it is moreover tolerably well known that\nSomerset House is a nest of public offices, which are held to be of less\nfashionable repute than those situated in the neighbourhood of Downing\nStreet, but are not so decidedly plebeian as the Custom House, Excise,\nand Post Office.\n\nBut there is one branch of the Civil Service located in Somerset House,\nwhich has little else to redeem it from the lowest depths of official\nvulgarity than the ambiguous respectability of its material position.\nThis is the office of the Commissioners of Internal Navigation. The\nduties to be performed have reference to the preservation of canal\nbanks, the tolls to be levied at locks, and disputes with the Admiralty\nas to points connected with tidal rivers. The rooms are dull and dark,\nand saturated with the fog which rises from the river, and their only\nornament is here and there some dusty model of an improved barge.\nBargees not unfrequently scuffle with hobnailed shoes through the\npassages, and go in and out, leaving behind them a smell of tobacco, to\nwhich the denizens of the place are not unaccustomed.\n\nIndeed, the whole office is apparently infected with a leaven of\nbargedom. Not a few of the men are employed from time to time in the\nsomewhat lethargic work of inspecting the banks and towing-paths of the\ncanals which intersect the country. This they generally do seated on a\nload of hay, or perhaps of bricks, in one of those long, ugly, shapeless\nboats, which are to be seen congregating in the neighbourhood of\nBrentford. So seated, they are carried along at the rate of a mile and\na half an hour, and usually while away the time in gentle converse with\nthe man at the rudder, or in silent abstraction over a pipe.\n\nBut the dullness of such a life as this is fully atoned for by the\nexcitement of that which follows it in London. The men of the Internal\nNavigation are known to be fast, nay, almost furious in their pace of\nliving; not that they are extravagant in any great degree, a fault which\ntheir scale of salaries very generally forbids; but they are one and all\naddicted to Coal Holes and Cider Cellars; they dive at midnight hours\ninto Shades, and know all the back parlours of all the public-houses\nin the neighbourhood of the Strand. Here they leave messages for one\nanother, and call the girl at the bar by her Christian name. They are a\nset of men endowed with sallow complexions, and they wear loud clothing,\nand spend more money in gin-and-water than in gloves.\n\nThe establishment is not unusually denominated the 'Infernal\nNavigation', and the gentlemen employed are not altogether displeased at\nhaving it so called. The 'Infernal Navvies', indeed, rather glory in the\nname. The navvies of Somerset House are known all over London, and there\nare those who believe that their business has some connexion with the\nrivers or railroads of that bourne from whence no traveller returns.\nLooking, however, from their office windows into the Thames, one might\nbe tempted to imagine that the infernal navigation with which they\nare connected is not situated so far distant from the place of their\nlabours.\n\nThe spirit who guards the entrance into this elysium is by no means so\ndifficult to deal with as Mr. Hardlines. And it was well that it was\nso some few years since for young Charley Tudor, a cousin of our friend\nAlaric; for Charley Tudor could never have passed muster at the Weights\nand Measures. Charles Tudor, the third of the three clerks alluded to in\nour title-page, is the son of a clergyman, who has a moderate living on\nthe Welsh border, in Shropshire. Had he known to what sort of work he\nwas sending his son, he might probably have hesitated before he accepted\nfor him a situation in the Internal Navigation Office. He was, however,\ntoo happy in getting it to make many inquiries as to its nature. We none\nof us like to look a gift-horse in the mouth. Old Mr. Tudor knew that\na clerkship in the Civil Service meant, or should mean, a respectable\nmaintenance for life, and having many young Tudors to maintain himself,\nhe was only too glad to find one of them provided for.\n\nCharley Tudor was some few years younger than his cousin Alaric when he\ncame up to town, and Alaric had at that time some three or four years'\nexperience of London life. The examination at the Internal Navigation\nwas certainly not to be so much dreaded as that at the Weights and\nMeasures; but still there was an examination; and Charley, who had not\nbeen the most diligent of schoolboys, approached it with great dread\nafter a preparatory evening passed with the assistance of his cousin and\nMr. Norman.\n\nExactly at ten in the morning he walked into the lobby of his future\nworkshop, and found no one yet there but two aged seedy messengers. He\nwas shown into a waiting-room, and there he remained for a couple of\nhours, during which every clerk in the establishment came to have a look\nat him. At last he was ushered into the Secretary's room.\n\n'Ah!' said the Secretary, 'your name is Tudor, isn't it?'\n\nCharley confessed to the fact.\n\n'Yea,' said the Secretary, 'I have heard about you from Sir Gilbert de\nSalop.' Now Sir Gilbert de Salop was the great family friend of this\nbranch of the Tudors. But Charley, finding that no remark suggested\nitself to him at this moment concerning Sir Gilbert, merely said, 'Yes,\nsir.'\n\n'And you wish to serve the Queen?' said the Secretary.\n\nCharley, not quite knowing whether this was a joke or not, said that he\ndid.\n\n'Quite right--it is a very fair ambition,' continued the great official\nfunctionary--'quite right--but, mind you, Mr. Tudor, if you come to us\nyou must come to work. I hope you like hard work; you should do so, if\nyou intend to remain with us.'\n\nCharley said that he thought he did rather like hard work. Hereupon\na senior clerk standing by, though a man not given to much laughter,\nsmiled slightly, probably in pity at the unceasing labour to which the\nyouth was about to devote himself.\n\n'The Internal Navigation requires great steadiness, good natural\nabilities, considerable education, and--and--and no end of application.\nCome, Mr. Tudor, let us see what you can do.' And so saying, Mr.\nOldeschole, the Secretary, motioned him to sit down at an office table\nopposite to himself.\n\nCharley did as he was bid, and took from the hands of his future master\nan old, much-worn quill pen, with which the great man had been signing\nminutes.\n\n'Now,' said the great man, 'just copy the few first sentences of that\nleading article--either one will do,' and he pushed over to him a huge\nnewspaper.\n\nTo tell the truth, Charley did not know what a leading article was, and\nso he sat abashed, staring at the paper.\n\n'Why don't you write?' asked the Secretary.\n\n'Where shall I begin, sir?' stammered poor Charley, looking piteously\ninto the examiner's face.\n\n'God bless my soul! there; either of those leading articles,' and\nleaning over the table, the Secretary pointed to a particular spot.\n\nHereupon Charley began his task in a large, ugly, round hand, neither\nthat of a man nor of a boy, and set himself to copy the contents of\nthe paper. 'The name of Pacifico stinks in the nostril of the British\npublic. It is well known to all the world how sincerely we admire the\nvers_i_tility of Lord Palmerston's genius; how cordially we s_i_mpathize\nwith his patriotic energies. But the admiration which even a Palmerston\ninspires must have a bound, and our s_i_mpathy may be called on too far.\nWhen we find ourselves asked to pay--'. By this time Charley had half\ncovered the half-sheet of foolscap which had been put before him, and\nhere at the word 'pay' he unfortunately suffered a large blot of ink to\nfall on the paper.\n\n'That won't do, Mr. Tudor, that won't do--come, let us look,' and\nstretching over again, the Secretary took up the copy.\n\n'Oh dear! oh dear! this is very bad; versatility with an 'i!'--sympathy\nwith an 'i!' sympathize with an 'i!' Why, Mr. Tudor, you must be very\nfond of 'i's' down in Shropshire.'\n\nCharley looked sheepish, but of course said nothing.\n\n'And I never saw a viler hand in my life. Oh dear, oh dear, I must send\nyou back to Sir Gilbert. Look here, Snape, this will never do--never do\nfor the Internal Navigation, will it?'\n\nSnape, the attendant senior clerk, said, as indeed he could not help\nsaying, that the writing was very bad.\n\n'I never saw worse in my life,' said the Secretary. 'And now, Mr. Tudor,\nwhat do you know of arithmetic?'\n\nCharley said that he thought he knew arithmetic pretty well;--'at least\nsome of it,' he modestly added.\n\n'Some of it!' said the Secretary, slightly laughing. 'Well, I'll tell\nyou what--this won't do at all;' and he took the unfortunate manuscript\nbetween his thumb and forefinger. 'You had better go home and endeavour\nto write something a little better than this. Mind, if it is not\nvery much better it won't do. And look here; take care that you do it\nyourself. If you bring me the writing of any one else, I shall be sure\nto detect you. I have not any more time now; as to arithmetic, we'll\nexamine you in 'some of it' to-morrow.'\n\nSo Charley, with a faint heart, went back to his cousin's lodgings and\nwaited till the two friends had arrived from the Weights and Measures.\nThe men there made a point of staying up to five o'clock, as is the case\nwith all model officials, and it was therefore late before he could get\nhimself properly set to work. But when they did arrive, preparations\nfor calligraphy were made on a great scale; a volume of Gibbon was taken\ndown, new quill pens, large and small, and steel pens by various makers\nwere procured; cream-laid paper was provided, and ruled lines were put\nbeneath it. And when this was done, Charley was especially cautioned to\ncopy the spelling as well as the wording.\n\nHe worked thus for an hour before dinner, and then for three hours in\nthe evening, and produced a very legible copy of half a chapter of the\n'Decline and Fall.'\n\n'I didn't think they examined at all at the Navigation,' said Norman.\n\n'Well, I believe it's quite a new thing,' said Alaric Tudor. 'The\nschoolmaster must be abroad with a vengeance, if he has got as far as\nthat.'\n\nAnd then they carefully examined Charley's work, crossed his t's, dotted\nhis i's, saw that his spelling was right, and went to bed.\n\nAgain, punctually at ten o'clock, Charley presented himself at the\nInternal Navigation; and again saw the two seedy old messengers warming\nthemselves at the lobby fire. On this occasion he was kept three hours\nin the waiting-room, and some of the younger clerks ventured to come and\nspeak to him. At length Mr. Snape appeared, and desired the acolyte\nto follow him. Charley, supposing that he was again going to the awful\nSecretary, did so with a palpitating heart. But he was led in another\ndirection into a large room, carrying his manuscript neatly rolled in\nhis hand. Here Mr. Snape introduced him to five other occupants of the\nchamber; he, Mr. Snape himself, having a separate desk there, being, in\nofficial parlance, the head of the room. Charley was told to take a\nseat at a desk, and did so, still thinking that the dread hour of his\nexamination was soon to come. His examination, however, was begun and\nover. No one ever asked for his calligraphic manuscript, and as to his\narithmetic, it may be presumed that his assurance that he knew 'some of\nit,' was deemed to be adequate evidence of sufficient capacity. And in\nthis manner, Charley Tudor became one of the Infernal Navvies.\n\nHe was a gay-hearted, thoughtless, rollicking young lad, when he came up\nto town; and it may therefore be imagined that he easily fell into the\npeculiar ways and habits of the office. A short bargee's pilot-coat, and\na pipe of tobacco, were soon familiar to him; and he had not been six\nmonths in London before he had his house-of-call in a cross lane running\nbetween Essex Street and Norfolk Street. 'Mary, my dear, a screw of\nbird's-eye!' came quite habitually to his lips; and before his fist year\nwas out, he had volunteered a song at the Buckingham Shades.\n\nThe assurance made to him on his first visit to the office by Mr.\nSecretary Oldeschole, that the Internal Navigation was a place of\nherculean labours, had long before this time become matter to him of\ndelightful ridicule. He had found himself to be one of six young men,\nwho habitually spent about five hours a day together in the same room,\nand whose chief employment was to render the life of the wretched Mr.\nSnape as unendurable as possible. There were copies to be written,\nand entries to be made, and books to be indexed. But these things\nwere generally done by some extra hand, as to the necessity of whose\nattendance for such purpose Mr. Snape was forced to certify. But poor\nSnape knew that he had no alternative. He rule six unruly young navvies!\nThere was not one of them who did not well know how to make him tremble\nin his shoes.\n\nPoor Mr. Snape had selected for his own peculiar walk in life a\ncharacter for evangelical piety. Whether he was a hypocrite--as all the\nnavvies averred--or a man sincere as far as one so weak could accomplish\nsincerity, it is hardly necessary for us to inquire. He was not by\nnature an ill-natured man, but he had become by education harsh to\nthose below him, and timid and cringing with those above. In the\nformer category must by no means be included the six young men who were\nnominally under his guidance. They were all but acknowledged by him as\nhis superiors. Ignorant as they were, they could hardly be more so than\nhe. Useless as they were, they did as much for the public service as\nhe did. He sometimes complained of them; but it was only when their\nmisconduct had been so loud as to make it no longer possible that he\nshould not do so.\n\nMr. Snape being thus by character and predilection a religious man,\nand having on various occasions in olden days professed much horror\nat having his ears wounded by conversation which was either immoral or\nprofane, it had of course become the habitual practice of the navvies to\ngive continual utterance to every description of ribaldry and blasphemy\nfor his especial edification. Doubtless it may be concluded from the\nhabits of the men, that even without such provocation, their talk would\nhave exceeded the yea, yea, and nay, nay, to which young men should\nconfine themselves. But they especially concerted schemes of blasphemy\nand dialogues of iniquity for Mr. Snape's particular advantage; and\ncontinued daily this disinterested amusement, till at last an idea\ngot abroad among them that Mr. Snape liked it. Then they changed their\ntactics and canted through their noses in the manner which they imagined\nto be peculiar to methodist preachers. So on the whole, Mr. Snape had an\nuneasy life of it at the Internal Navigation.\n\nInto all these malpractices Charley Tudor plunged headlong. And how\nshould it have been otherwise? How can any youth of nineteen or twenty\ndo other than consort himself with the daily companions of his usual\navocations? Once and again, in one case among ten thousand, a lad may\nbe found formed of such stuff, that he receives neither the good nor the\nbad impulses of those around him. But such a one is a _lapsus naturae_.\nHe has been born without the proper attributes of youth, or at any rate,\nbrought up so as to have got rid of them.\n\nSuch, a one, at any rate, Charley Tudor was not. He was a little shocked\nat first by the language he heard; but that feeling soon wore off. His\nkind heart, also, in the first month of his novitiate, sympathized with\nthe daily miseries of Mr. Snape; but he also soon learnt to believe that\nMr. Snape was a counterfeit, and after the first half year could torture\nhim with as much gusto as any of his brethren. Alas! no evil tendency\ncommunicates itself among young men more quickly than cruelty. Those\ninfernal navvies were very cruel to Mr. Snape.\n\nAnd yet young Tudor was a lad of a kindly heart, of a free, honest, open\ndisposition, deficient in no proportion of mind necessary to make an\nestimable man. But he was easily malleable, and he took at once the full\nimpression of the stamp to which he was subjected. Had he gone into\nthe Weights and Measures, a hypothesis which of course presumes a total\nprostration of the intellects and energy of Mr. Hardlines, he would have\nworked without a groan from ten till five, and have become as good a\nmodel as the best of them. As it was, he can be hardly said to have\nworked at all, soon became _facile princeps_ in the list of habitual\nidlers, and was usually threatened once a quarter with dismissal, even\nfrom that abode of idleness, in which the very nature of true work was\nunknown.\n\nSome tidings of Charley's doings in London, and non-doings at the\nInternal Navigation, of course found their way to the Shropshire\nparsonage. His dissipation was not of a very costly kind; but \u00c2\u00a390 per\nannum will hardly suffice to afford an ample allowance of gin-and-water\nand bird's-eye tobacco, over and above the other wants of a man's life.\nBills arrived there requiring payment; and worse than this, letters also\ncame through Sir Gilbert de Salop from Mr. Oldeschole, the Secretary,\nsaying that young Tudor was disgracing the office, and lowering the\nhigh character of the Internal Navigation; and that he must be removed,\nunless he could be induced to alter his line of life, &c.\n\nUrgent austere letters came from the father, and fond heart-rending\nappeals from the mother. Charley's heart was rent. It was, at any rate,\na sign in him that he was not past hope of grace, that he never laughed\nat these monitions, that he never showed such letters to his companions,\nnever quizzed his 'governor's' lectures, or made merry over the grief of\nhis mother. But if it be hard for a young man to keep in the right\npath when he has not as yet strayed out of it, how much harder is it to\nreturn to it when he has long since lost the track! It was well for\nthe father to write austere letters, well for the mother to make tender\nappeals, but Charley could not rid himself of his companions, nor of his\ndebts, nor yet even of his habits. He could not get up in the morning\nand say that he would at once be as his cousin Alaric, or as his\ncousin's friend, Mr. Norman. It is not by our virtues or our vices that\nwe are judged, even by those who know us best; but by such credit for\nvirtues or for vices as we may have acquired. Now young Tudor's credit\nfor virtue was very slight, and he did not know how to extend it.\n\nAt last papa and mamma Tudor came up to town to make one last effort to\nsave their son; and also to save, on his behalf, the valuable official\nappointment which he held. He had now been three years in his office,\nand his salary had risen to \u00c2\u00a3110 per annum. \u00c2\u00a3110 per annum was worth\nsaving if it could be saved. The plan adopted by Mrs. Tudor was that of\nbeseeching their cousin Alaric to take Charley under his especial wing.\n\nWhen Charley first arrived in town, the fact of Alaric and Norman living\ntogether had given the former a good excuse for not offering to share\nhis lodgings with his cousin. Alaric, with the advantage in age of\nthree or four years--at that period of life the advantage lies in that\ndirection--with his acquired experience of London life, and also with\nall the wondrous \u00c3\u00a9clat of the Weights and Measures shining round him,\nhad perhaps been a little too unwilling to take by the hand a rustic\ncousin who was about to enter life under the questionable auspices of\nthe Internal Navigation. He had helped Charley to transcribe the chapter\nof Gibbon, and had, it must be owned, lent him from time to time a\nfew odd pounds in his direst necessities. But their course in life had\nhitherto been apart. Of Norman, Charley had seen less even than of his\ncousin.\n\nAnd now it became a difficult question with Alaric how he was to answer\nthe direct appeal made to him by Mrs. Tudor;--'Pray, pray let him live\nwith you, if it be only for a year, Alaric,' the mother had said, with\nthe tears running down her cheeks. 'You are so good, so discreet, so\nclever--you can save him.' Alaric promised, or was ready to promise,\nanything else, but hesitated as to the joint lodgings. 'How could he\nmanage it,' said he, 'living, as he was, with another man? He feared\nthat Mr. Norman would not accede to such an arrangement. As for himself,\nhe would do anything but leave his friend Norman.' To tell the truth,\nAlaric thought much, perhaps too much, of the respectability of those\nwith whom he consorted. He had already begun to indulge ambitious\nschemes, already had ideas stretching even beyond the limits of the\nWeights and Measures, and fully intended to make the very most of\nhimself.\n\nMrs. Tudor, in her deep grief, then betook herself to Mr. Norman, though\nwith that gentleman she had not even the slightest acquaintance. With\na sulking heart, with a consciousness of her unreasonableness, but with\nthe eloquence of maternal sorrow, she made her request. Mr. Norman heard\nher out with all the calm propriety of the Weights and Measures, begged\nto have a day to consider, and then acceded to the request.\n\n'I think we ought to do it,' said he to Alaric. The mother's tears\nhad touched his heart, and his sense of duty had prevailed. Alaric, of\ncourse, could now make no further objection, and thus Charley the Navvy\nbecame domesticated with his cousin Alaric and Harry Norman.\n\nThe first great question to be settled, and it is a very great question\nwith a young man, was that of latch-key or no latch-key. Mrs. Richards,\nthe landlady, when she made ready the third bedroom for the young\ngentleman, would, as was her wont in such matters, have put a latch-key\non the toilet-table as a matter of course, had she not had some little\nconversation with Mamma Tudor regarding her son. Mamma Tudor had\nimplored and coaxed, and probably bribed Mrs. Richards to do something\nmore than 'take her son in and do for him'; and Mrs. Richards, as her\nfirst compliance with these requests, had kept the latch-key in her own\npocket. So matters went on for a week; but when Mrs. Richards found that\nher maidservant was never woken by Mr. Charley's raps after midnight,\nand that she herself was obliged to descend in her dressing-gown, she\nchanged her mind, declared to herself that it was useless to attempt to\nkeep a grown gentleman in leading-strings, and put the key on the table\non the second Monday morning.\n\nAs none of the three men ever dined at home, Alaric and Norman having\nclubs which they frequented, and Charley eating his dinner at some\nneighbouring dining-house, it may be imagined that this change of\nresidence did our poor navvy but little good. It had, however, a\nsalutary effect on him, at any rate at first. He became shamed into a\nquieter and perhaps cleaner mode of dressing himself; he constrained\nhimself to sit down to breakfast with his monitors at half-past eight,\nand was at any rate so far regardful of Mrs. Richards as not to smoke\nin his bedroom, and to come home sober enough to walk upstairs without\nassistance every night for the first month.\n\nBut perhaps the most salutary effect made by this change on young Tudor\nwas this, that he was taken by his cousin one Sunday to the Woodwards.\nPoor Charley had had but small opportunity of learning what are the\npleasures of decent society. He had gone headlong among the infernal\nnavvies too quickly to allow of that slow and gradual formation of\ndecent alliances which is all in all to a young man entering life. A boy\nis turned loose into London, and desired to choose the good and eschew\nthe bad. Boy as he is, he might probably do so if the opportunity came\nin his way. But no such chance is afforded him. To eschew the bad is\ncertainly possible for him; but as to the good, he must wait till he\nbe chosen. This it is, that is too much for him. He cannot live without\nsociety, and so he falls.\n\nSociety, an ample allowance of society, this is the first requisite\nwhich a mother should seek in sending her son to live alone in London;\nballs, routs, picnics, parties; women, pretty, well-dressed, witty,\neasy-mannered; good pictures, elegant drawing rooms, well got-up books,\nMajolica and Dresden china--these are the truest guards to protect a\nyouth from dissipation and immorality.\n\n  These are the books, the arts, the academes\n  That show, contain, and nourish all the world,\n\nif only a youth could have them at his disposal. Some of these things,\nthough by no means all, Charley Tudor encountered at the Woodwards.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE WOODWARDS\n\n\nIt is very difficult nowadays to say where the suburbs of London come to\nan end, and where the country begins. The railways, instead of enabling\nLondoners to live in the country, have turned the country into a city.\nLondon will soon assume the shape of a great starfish. The old town,\nextending from Poplar to Hammersmith, will be the nucleus, and the\nvarious railway lines will be the projecting rays.\n\nThere are still, however, some few nooks within reach of the metropolis\nwhich have not been be-villaged and be-terraced out of all look of rural\ncharm, and the little village of Hampton, with its old-fashioned country\ninn, and its bright, quiet, grassy river, is one of them, in spite\nof the triple metropolitan waterworks on the one side, and the close\nvicinity on the other of Hampton Court, that well-loved resort of\ncockneydom.\n\nIt was here that the Woodwards lived. Just on the outskirts of the\nvillage, on the side of it farthest from town, they inhabited not a\nvilla, but a small old-fashioned brick house, abutting on to the road,\nbut looking from its front windows on to a lawn and garden, which\nstretched down to the river.\n\nThe grounds were not extensive, being included, house and all, in an\narea of an acre and a half: but the most had been made of it; it sloped\nprettily to the river, and was absolutely secluded from the road. Thus\nSurbiton Cottage, as it was called, though it had no pretension to the\ngrandeur of a country-house, was a desirable residence for a moderate\nfamily with a limited income.\n\nMrs. Woodward's family, for there was no Mr. Woodward in the case,\nconsisted of herself and three daughters. There was afterwards added\nto this an old gentleman, an uncle of Mrs. Woodward's, but he had\nnot arrived at the time at which we would wish first to introduce our\nreaders to Hampton.\n\nMrs. Woodward was the widow of a clergyman who had held a living in\nLondon, and had resided there. He had, however, died when two of his\nchildren were very young, and while the third was still a baby. From\nthat time Mrs. Woodward had lived at the cottage at Hampton, and had\nthere maintained a good repute, paying her way from month to month\nas widows with limited incomes should do, and devoting herself to the\namusements and education of her daughters.\n\nIt was not, probably, from any want of opportunity to cast them aside,\nthat Mrs. Woodward had remained true to her weeds; for at the time of\nher husband's death she was a young and a very pretty woman; and an\nincome of \u00c2\u00a3400 a year, though moderate enough for all the wants of a\ngentleman's family, would no doubt have added sufficiently to her charms\nto have procured her a second alliance, had she been so minded.\n\nTwelve years, however, had now elapsed since Mr. Woodward had been\ngathered to his fathers, and the neighbouring world of Hampton, who\nhad all of them declared over and over again that the young widow would\ncertainly marry again, were now becoming as unanimous in their expressed\nopinion that the old widow knew the value of her money too well to risk\nit in the keeping of the best he that ever wore boots.\n\nAt the date at which our story commences, she was a comely little woman,\npast forty, somewhat below the middle height, rather _embonpoint_, as\nwidows of forty should be, with pretty fat feet, and pretty fat hands;\nwearing just a _soup\u00c3\u00a7on_ of a widow's cap on her head, with her hair,\nnow slightly grey, parted in front, and brushed very smoothly, but not\ntoo carefully, in _bandeaux_ over her forehead.\n\nShe was a quick little body, full of good-humour, slightly given to\nrepartee, and perhaps rather too impatient of a fool. But though averse\nto a fool, she could sympathize with folly. A great poet has said that\nwomen are all rakes at heart; and there was something of the rake at\nheart about Mrs. Woodward. She never could be got to express adequate\nhorror at fast young men, and was apt to have her own sly little joke\nat women who prided themselves on being punctilious. She could, perhaps,\nthe more safely indulge in this, as scandal had never even whispered a\nword against herself.\n\nWith her daughters she lived on terms almost of equality. The two\nelder were now grown up; that is, they were respectively eighteen and\nseventeen years old. They were devotedly attached to their mother,\nlooked on her as the only perfect woman in existence, and would\nwillingly do nothing that could vex her; but they perhaps were not quite\nso systematically obedient to her as children should be to their only\nsurviving parent. Mrs. Woodward, however, found nothing amiss, and no\none else therefore could well have a right to complain.\n\nThey were both pretty--but Gertrude, the elder, was by far the more\nstrikingly so. They were, nevertheless, much alike; they both had rich\nbrown hair, which they, like their mother, wore simply parted over the\nforehead. They were both somewhat taller than her, and were nearly of\na height. But in appearance, as in disposition, Gertrude carried by far\nthe greater air of command. She was the handsomer of the two, and the\ncleverer. She could write French and nearly speak it, while her sister\ncould only read it. She could play difficult pieces from sight, which\nit took her sister a morning's pains to practise. She could fill in and\nfinish a drawing, while her sister was still struggling, and struggling\nin vain, with the first principles of the art.\n\nBut there was a softness about Linda, for such was the name of the\nsecond Miss Woodward, which in the eyes of many men made up both for the\nsuperior beauty and superior talent of Gertrude. Gertrude was, perhaps,\nhardly so soft as so young a girl should be. In her had been magnified\nthat spirit of gentle raillery which made so attractive a part of her\nmother's character. She enjoyed and emulated her mother's quick sharp\nsayings, but she hardly did so with her mother's grace, and sometimes\nattempted it with much more than her mother's severity. She also\ndetested fools; but in promulgating her opinion on this subject, she was\ntoo apt to declare who the fools were whom she detested.\n\nIt may be thought that under such circumstances there could be but\nlittle confidence between the sisters; but, nevertheless, in their early\ndays, they lived together as sisters should do. Gertrude, when she\nspoke of fools, never intended to include Linda in the number; and Linda\nappreciated too truly, and admired too thoroughly, her sister's beauty\nand talent to be jealous of either.\n\nOf the youngest girl, Katie, it is not necessary at present to say much.\nAt this time she was but thirteen years of age, and was a happy, pretty,\nromping child. She gave fair promise to be at any rate equal to her\nsisters in beauty, and in mind was quick and intelligent. Her great\ntaste was for boating, and the romance of her life consisted in laying\nout ideal pleasure-grounds, and building ideal castles in a little\nreedy island or ait which lay out in the Thames, a few perches from the\ndrawing-room windows.\n\nSuch was the family of the Woodwards. Harry Norman's father and Mr.\nWoodward had been first cousins, and hence it had been quite natural\nthat when Norman came up to reside in London he should be made welcome\nto Surbiton Cottage. He had so been made welcome, and had thus got into\na habit of spending his Saturday evenings and Sundays at the home of his\nrelatives. In summer he could row up in his own wherry, and land himself\nand carpet-bag direct on the Woodwards' lawn, and in the winter he came\ndown by the Hampton Court five p.m. train--and in each case he returned\non the Monday morning. Thus, as regards that portion of his time which\nwas most his own, he may be said almost to have lived at Surbiton\nCottage, and if on any Sunday he omitted to make his appearance, the\nomission was ascribed by the ladies of Hampton, in some half-serious\nsort of joke, to metropolitan allurements and temptations which he ought\nto have withstood.\n\nWhen Tudor and Norman came to live together, it was natural enough that\nTudor also should be taken down to Surbiton Cottage. Norman could not\nleave him on every Saturday without telling him much of his friends whom\nhe went to visit, and he could hardly say much of them without offering\nto introduce his companion to them. Tudor accordingly went there, and\nit soon came to pass that he also very frequently spent his Sundays at\nHampton.\n\nIt must be remembered that at this time, the time, that is, of Norman\nand Tudor's first entrance on their London life, the girls at Surbiton\nCottage were mere girls--that is, little more than children; they had\nnot, as it were, got their wings so as to be able to fly away when the\nprovocation to do so might come; they were, in short, Gertrude and Linda\nWoodward, and not the Miss Woodwards: their drawers came down below\ntheir frocks, instead of their frocks below their drawers; and in lieu\nof studying the French language, as is done by grown-up ladies, they did\nFrench lessons, as is the case with ladies who are not grown-up. Under\nthese circumstances there was no embarrassment as to what the young\npeople should call each other, and they soon became very intimate as\nHarry and Alaric, Gertrude and Linda.\n\nIt is not, however, to be conceived that Alaric Tudor at once took the\nsame footing in the house as Norman. This was far from being the case.\nIn the first place he never slept there, seeing that there was no bed\nfor him; and the most confidential intercourse in the household took\nplace as they sat cosy over the last embers of the drawing-room fire,\nchatting about everything and nothing, as girls always can do, after\nTudor had gone away to his bed at the inn, on the opposite side of the\nway. And then Tudor did not come on every Saturday, and at first did not\ndo so without express invitation; and although the girls soon habituated\nthemselves to the familiarity of their new friend's Christian name, it\nwas some time before Mrs. Woodward did so.\n\nTwo--three years soon flew by, and Linda and Gertrude became the Miss\nWoodwards; their frocks were prolonged, their drawers curtailed, and\nthe lessons abandoned. But still Alaric Tudor and Harry Norman came to\nHampton not less frequently than of yore, and the world resident on that\nportion of the left bank of the Thames found out that Harry Norman and\nGertrude Woodward were to be man and wife, and that Alaric Tudor and\nLinda Woodward were to go through the same ceremony. They found this\nout, or said that they had done so. But, as usual, the world was wrong;\nat least in part, for at the time of which we are speaking no word of\nlove-making had passed, at any rate, between the last-named couple.\n\nAnd what was Mrs. Woodward about all this time? Was she match-making or\nmatch-marring; or was she negligently omitting the duties of a mother\non so important an occasion? She was certainly neither match-making\nnor match-marring; but it was from no negligence that she was thus\nquiescent. She knew, or thought she knew, that the two young men were\nfit to be husbands to her daughters, and she felt that if the wish for\nsuch an alliance should spring up between either pair, there was no\nreason why she should interfere to prevent it. But she felt also that\nshe should not interfere to bring any such matter to pass. These young\npeople had by chance been thrown together. Should there be love-passages\namong them, as it was natural to suppose there might be, it would be\nwell. Should there be none such, it would be well also. She thoroughly\ntrusted her own children, and did not distrust her friends; and so as\nregards Mrs. Woodward the matter was allowed to rest.\n\nWe cannot say that on this matter we quite approve of her conduct,\nthough we cannot but admire the feeling which engendered it. Her\ndaughters were very young; though they had made such positive advances\nas have been above described towards the discretion of womanhood, they\nwere of the age when they would have been regarded as mere boys had they\nbelonged to the other sex. The assertion made by Clara Van Artevelde,\nthat women 'grow upon the sunny side of the wall,' is doubtless true;\nbut young ladies, gifted as they are with such advantages, may perhaps\nbe thought to require some counsel, some advice, in those first tender\nyears in which they so often have to make or mar their fortunes.\n\nNot that Mrs. Woodward gave them no advice; not but that she advised\nthem well and often--but she did so, perhaps, too much as an equal, too\nlittle as a parent.\n\nBut, be that as it may--and I trust my readers will not be inclined\nso early in our story to lean heavily on Mrs. Woodward, whom I at once\ndeclare to be my own chief favourite in the tale--but, be that as it\nmay, it so occurred that Gertrude, before she was nineteen, had listened\nto vows of love from Harry Norman, which she neither accepted nor\nrepudiated; and that Linda had, before she was eighteen, perhaps\nunfortunately, taught herself to think it probable that she might have\nto listen to vows of love from Alaric Tudor.\n\nThere had been no concealment between the young men as to their\nfeelings. Norman had told his friend scores of times that it was the\nfirst wish of his heart to marry Gertrude Woodward; and had told him,\nmoreover, what were his grounds for hope, and what his reasons for\ndespair.\n\n'She is as proud as a queen,' he had once said as he was rowing from\nHampton to Searle's Wharf, and lay on his oars as the falling tide\ncarried his boat softly past the green banks of Richmond--'she is as\nproud as a queen, and yet as timid as a fawn. She lets me tell her that\nI love her, but she will not say a word to me in reply; as for touching\nher in the way of a caress, I should as soon think of putting my arm\nround a goddess.'\n\n'And why not put your arms round a goddess?' said Alaric, who was\nperhaps a little bolder than his friend, and a little less romantic. To\nthis Harry answered nothing, but, laying his back to his work, swept\non past the gardens of Kew, and shot among the wooden dangers of Putney\nBridge.\n\n'I wish you could bring yourself to make up to Linda,' said he, resting\nagain from his labours; 'that would make the matter so much easier.'\n\n'Bring myself!' said Alaric; 'what you mean is, that you wish I could\nbring Linda to consent to be made up to.'\n\n'I don't think you would have much difficulty,' said Harry, finding it\nmuch easier to answer for Linda than for her sister; 'but perhaps you\ndon't admire her?'\n\n'I think her by far the prettier of the two,' said Alaric.\n\n'That's nonsense,' said Harry, getting rather red in the face, and\nfeeling rather angry.\n\n'Indeed I do; and so, I am convinced, would most men. You need not\nmurder me, man. You want me to make up to Linda, and surely it will be\nbetter that I should admire my own wife than yours.'\n\n'Oh! you may admire whom you like; but to say that she is prettier than\nGertrude--why, you know, it is nonsense.'\n\n'Very well, my dear fellow; then to oblige you, I'll fall in love with\nGertrude.'\n\n'I know you won't do that,' said Harry, 'for you are not so very fond of\neach other; but, joking apart, I do wish so you would make up to Linda.'\n\n'Well, I will when _my_ aunt leaves _me_ \u00c2\u00a3200 a year.'\n\nThere was no answering this; so the two men changed the conversation as\nthey walked up together from the boat wharf to the office of the Weights\nand Measures.\n\nIt was just at this time that fortune and old Mr. Tudor, of the\nShropshire parsonage, brought Charley Tudor to reside with our two\nheroes. For the first month, or six weeks, Charley was ruthlessly left\nby his companions to get through his Sundays as best he could. It is to\nbe hoped that he spent them in divine worship; but it may, we fear, be\nsurmised with more probability, that he paid his devotions at the\nshrine of some very inferior public-house deity in the neighbourhood of\nSomerset House. As a matter of course, both Norman and Tudor spoke much\nof their new companion to the ladies at Surbiton Cottage, and as by\ndegrees they reported somewhat favourably of his improved morals, Mrs.\nWoodward, with a woman's true kindness, begged that he might be brought\ndown to Hampton.\n\n'I am afraid you will find him very rough,' said his cousin Alaric.\n\n'At any rate you will not find him a fool,' said Norman, who was always\nthe more charitable of the two.\n\n'Thank God for that!' said Mrs. Woodward,' and if he will come next\nSaturday, let him by all means do so. Pray give my compliments to him,\nand tell him how glad I shall be to see him.'\n\nAnd thus was this wild wolf to be led into the sheep-cote; this infernal\nnavvy to be introduced among the angels of Surbiton Cottage. Mrs.\nWoodward thought that she had a taste for reclaiming reprobates, and was\ndetermined to try her hand on Charley Tudor.\n\nCharley went, and his debut was perfectly successful. We have hitherto\nonly looked on the worst side of his character; but bad as his\ncharacter was, it had a better side. He was good-natured in the extreme,\nkind-hearted and affectionate; and, though too apt to be noisy and\neven boisterous when much encouraged, was not without a certain innate\ngenuine modesty, which the knowledge of his own iniquities had rather\nincreased than blunted; and, as Norman had said of him, he was no fool.\nHis education had not been good, and he had done nothing by subsequent\nreading to make up for this deficiency; but he was well endowed with\nmother-wit, and owed none of his deficiencies to nature's churlishness.\n\nHe came, and was well received. The girls thought he would surely get\ndrunk before he left the table, and Mrs. Woodward feared the austere\nprecision of her parlour-maid might be offended by some unworthy\nfamiliarity; but no accident of either kind seemed to occur. He came to\nthe tea-table perfectly sober, and, as far as Mrs. Woodward could tell,\nwas unaware of the presence of the parlour-maiden.\n\nOn the Sunday morning, Charley went to church, just like a Christian.\nNow Mrs. Woodward certainly had expected that he would have spent those\ntwo hours in smoking and attacking the parlour-maid. He went to church,\nhowever, and seemed in no whit astray there; stood up when others stood\nup, and sat down when others sat down. After all, the infernal navvies,\nbad as they doubtless were, knew something of the recognized manners of\ncivilized life.\n\nThus Charley Tudor ingratiated himself at Surbiton Cottage, and when\nhe left, received a kind intimation from its mistress that she would\nbe glad to see him again. No day was fixed, and so Charley could not\naccompany his cousin and Harry Norman on the next Saturday; but it was\nnot long before he got another direct invitation, and so he also became\nintimate at Hampton. There could be no danger of any one falling in love\nwith him, for Katie was still a child.\n\nThings stood thus at Surbiton Cottage when Mrs. Woodward received a\nproposition from a relative of her own, which surprised them all not a\nlittle. This was from a certain Captain Cuttwater, who was a maternal\nuncle to Mrs. Woodward, and consisted of nothing less than an offer to\ncome and live with them for the remaining term of his natural life. Now\nMrs. Woodward's girls had seen very little of their grand-uncle, and\nwhat little they had seen had only taught them to laugh at him. When\nhis name was mentioned in the family conclave, he was always made the\nsubject of some little feminine joke; and Mrs. Woodward, though she\nalways took her uncle's part, did so in a manner that made them feel\nthat he was fair game for their quizzing.\n\nWhen the proposal was first enunciated to the girls, they one and all,\nfor Katie was one of the council, suggested that it should be declined\nwith many thanks.\n\n'He'll take us all for midshipmen,' said Linda, 'and stop our rations,\nand mast-head us whenever we displease him.'\n\n'I am sure he is a cross old hunks, though mamma says he's not,' said\nKatie, with all the impudence of spoilt fourteen.\n\n'He'll interfere with every one of our pursuits,' said Gertrude, more\nthoughtfully, 'and be sure to quarrel with the young men.'\n\nBut Mrs. Woodward, though she had consulted her daughters, had arguments\nof her own in favour of Captain Cuttwater's proposition, which she had\nnot yet made known to them. Good-humoured and happy as she always was,\nshe had her cares in the world. Her income was only \u00c2\u00a3400 a year,\nand that, now that the Income Tax had settled down on it, was barely\nsufficient for her modest wants. A moiety of this died with her, and the\nremainder would be but a poor support for her three daughters, if at the\ntime of her death it should so chance that she should leave them in\nwant of support. She had always regarded Captain Cuttwater as a probable\nsource of future aid. He was childless and unmarried, and had not,\nas far as she was aware, another relative in the world. It would,\ntherefore, under any circumstances, be bad policy to offend him. But the\nletter in which he had made his offer had been of a very peculiar kind.\nHe had begun by saying that he was to be turned out of his present berth\nby a d---- Whig Government on account of his age, he being as young a\nman as ever he had been; that it behoved him to look out for a place of\nresidence, in which he might live, and, if it should so please God, die\nalso. He then said that he expected to pay \u00c2\u00a3200 a year for his board\nand lodging, which he thought might as well go to his niece as to some\nshark, who would probably starve him. He also said that, poor as he was\nand always had been, he had contrived to scrape together a few hundred\npounds; that he was well aware that if he lived among strangers he\nshould be done out of every shilling of it; but that if his niece would\nreceive him, he hoped to be able to keep it together for the benefit of\nhis grand-nieces, &c.\n\nNow Mrs. Woodward knew her uncle to be an honest-minded man; she knew\nalso, that, in spite of his protestation as to being a very poor man, he\nhad saved money enough to make him of some consequence wherever he went;\nand she therefore conceived that she could not with prudence send him to\nseek a home among chance strangers. She explained as much of this to\nthe girls as she thought proper, and ended the matter by making them\nunderstand that Captain Cuttwater was to be received.\n\nOn the Saturday after this the three scions of the Civil Service were\nall at Surbiton Cottage, and it will show how far Charley had then made\ngood his ground, to state that the coming of the captain was debated in\nhis presence.\n\n'And when is the great man to be here?' said Norman.\n\n'At once, I believe,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'that is, perhaps, before the\nend of this week, and certainly before the end of next.'\n\n'And what is he like?' said Alaric.\n\n'Why, he has a tail hanging down behind, like a cat or a dog,' said\nKatie.\n\n'Hold your tongue, miss,' said Gertrude. 'As he is to come he must be\ntreated with respect; but it is a great bore. To me it will destroy all\nthe pleasures of life.'\n\n'Nonsense, Gertrude,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'it is almost wicked of you to\nsay so. Destroy all the pleasure of life to have an old gentleman live\nin the same house with you!--you ought to be more moderate, my dear, in\nwhat you say.'\n\n'That's all very well, mamma,' said Gertrude, 'but you know you don't\nlike him yourself.'\n\n'But is it true that Captain Cuttwater wears a pigtail?' asked Norman.\n\n'I don't care what he wears,' said Gertrude; 'he may wear three if he\nlikes.'\n\n'Oh! I wish he would,' said Katie, laughing; 'that would be so\ndelicious. Oh, Linda, fancy Captain Cuttwater with three pigtails!'\n\n\n'I am sorry to disappoint you, Katie,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'but your\nuncle does not wear even one; he once did, but he cut it off long\nsince.'\n\n'I am so sorry,' said Katie.\n\n'I suppose he'll want to dine early, and go to bed early?' said Linda.\n\n'His going to bed early would be a great blessing,' said Gertrude,\nmindful of their midnight conclaves on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\n'But his getting up early won't be a blessing at all,' said Linda, who\nhad a weakness on that subject.\n\n'Talking of bed, Harry, you'll have the worst of it,' said Katie, 'for\nthe captain is to have your room.'\n\n'Yes, indeed,' said Mrs. Woodward, sighing gently, 'we shall no longer\nhave a bed for you, Harry; that _is_ the worst of it.'\n\nHarry of course assured her that if that was the worst of it there was\nnothing very bad in it. He could have a bed at the inn as well as Alaric\nand Charley. The amount of that evil would only be half-a-crown a night.\n\nAnd thus the advent of Captain Cuttwater was discussed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nCAPTAIN CUTTWATER\n\n\nCaptain Cuttwater had not seen much service afloat; that is, he had not\nbeen personally concerned in many of those sea-engagements which in and\nabout the time of Nelson gave so great a halo of glory to the British\nLion; nor had it even been permitted to him to take a prominent part in\nsuch minor affairs as have since occurred; he had not the opportunity\nof distinguishing himself either at the battle of Navarino or the\nbombarding of Acre; and, unfortunately for his ambition, the period of\nhis retirement came before that great Baltic campaign, in which, had he\nbeen there, he would doubtless have distinguished himself as did so many\nothers. His earliest years were spent in cruising among the West Indies;\nhe then came home and spent some considerable portion of his life in\nidleness--if that time can be said to have been idly spent which he\ndevoted to torturing the Admiralty with applications, remonstrances,\nand appeals. Then he was rated as third lieutenant on the books of some\nworm-eaten old man-of-war at Portsmouth, and gave up his time to looking\nafter the stowage of anchors, and counting fathoms of rope. At last\nhe was again sent afloat as senior lieutenant in a ten-gun brig, and\ncruised for some time off the coast of Africa, hunting for slavers; and\nreturning after a while from this enterprising employment, he received a\nsort of amphibious appointment at Devonport. What his duties were here,\nthe author, being in all points a landsman, is unable to describe. Those\nwho were inclined to ridicule Captain Cuttwater declared that the most\nimportant of them consisted in seeing that the midshipmen in and about\nthe dockyard washed their faces, and put on clean linen not less often\nthan three times a week. According to his own account, he had many\nthings of a higher nature to attend to; and, indeed, hardly a ship sank\nor swam in Hamoaze except by his special permission, for a space of\ntwenty years, if his own view of his own career may be accepted as\ncorrect.\n\nHe had once declared to certain naval acquaintances, over his third\nglass of grog, that he regarded it as his birthright to be an Admiral;\nbut at the age of seventy-two he had not yet acquired his birthright,\nand the probability of his ever attaining it was becoming very small\nindeed. He was still bothering Lords and Secretaries of the Admiralty\nfor further promotion, when he was astounded by being informed by the\nPort-Admiral that he was to be made happy by half-pay and a pension. The\nAdmiral, in communicating the intelligence, had pretended to think that\nhe was giving the captain information which could not be otherwise than\ngrateful to him, but he was not the less aware that the old man would\nbe furious at being so treated. What, pension him! put him on\nhalf-pay--shelf him for life, while he was still anxiously expecting\nthat promotion, that call to higher duties which had so long been his\ndue, and which, now that his powers were matured, could hardly be longer\ndenied to him! And after all that he had done for his country--his\nungrateful, thankless, ignorant country--was he thus to be treated? Was\nhe to be turned adrift without any mark of honour, any special guerdon,\nany sign of his Sovereign's favour to testify as to his faithful\nservitude of sixty years' devotion? He, who had regarded it as his\nmerest right to be an Admiral, and had long indulged the hope of being\ngreeted in the streets of Devonport as Sir Bartholomew Cuttwater,\nK.C.B., was he to be thus thrown aside in his prime, with no other\nacknowledgement than the bare income to which he was entitled!\n\nIt is hardly too much to say, that no old officers who have lacked the\nmeans to distinguish themselves, retire from either of our military\nservices, free from the bitter disappointment and sour feelings of\nneglected worth, which Captain Cuttwater felt so keenly. A clergyman, or\na doctor, or a lawyer, feels himself no whit disgraced if he reaches\nthe end of his worldly labours without special note or honour. But to a\nsoldier or a sailor, such indifference to his merit is wormwood. It is\nthe bane of the professions. Nine men out of ten who go into it must\nlive discontented, and die disappointed.\n\nCaptain Cuttwater had no idea that he was an old man. He had lived for\nso many years among men of his own stamp, who had grown grey and bald,\nand rickety, and weak alongside of him, that he had no opportunity of\nseeing that he was more grey or more rickety than his neighbours. No\nchildren had become men and women at his feet; no new race had gone out\ninto the world and fought their battles under his notice. One set\nof midshipmen had succeeded to another, but his old comrades in the\nnews-rooms and lounging-places at Devonport had remained the same; and\nCaptain Cuttwater had never learnt to think that he was not doing, and\nwas not able to do good service for his country.\n\nThe very name of Captain Cuttwater was odious to every clerk at the\nAdmiralty. He, like all naval officers, hated the Admiralty, and\nthought, that of all Englishmen, those five who had been selected to sit\nthere in high places as joint lords were the most incapable. He pestered\nthem with continued and almost continuous applications on subjects of\nall sorts. He was always asking for increased allowances, advanced rank,\nmore assistance, less work, higher privileges, immunities which could\nnot be granted, and advantages to which he had no claim. He never\ntook answers, but made every request the subject of a prolonged\ncorrespondence; till at last some energetic Assistant-Secretary declared\nthat it should no longer be borne, and Captain Cuttwater was dismissed\nwith pension and half-pay. During his service he had contrived to save\nsome four or five thousand pounds, and now he was about to retire with\nan assured income adequate to all his wants. The public who had the\npaying of Captain Cuttwater may, perhaps, think that he was amply\nremunerated for what he had done; but the captain himself entertained a\nvery different opinion.\n\nSuch is the view which we are obliged to take of the professional side\nof Captain Cuttwater's character. But the professional side was by far\nthe worst. Counting fathoms of rope and looking after unruly midshipmen\non shore are not duties capable of bringing out in high relief the\nbetter traits of a main's character. Uncle Bat, as during the few\nlast years of his life he was always called at Surbiton Cottage, was a\ngentleman and a man of honour, in spite of anything that might be said\nto the contrary at the Admiralty. He was a man with a soft heart, though\nthe end of his nose was so large, so red, and so pimply; and rough as\nwas his usage to little midshipmen when his duty caused him to encounter\nthem in a body, he had befriended many a one singly with kind words and\nan open hand. The young rogues would unmercifully quiz Old Nosey, for so\nCaptain Cuttwater was generally called in Devonport, whenever they could\nsafely do so; but, nevertheless, in their young distresses they knew him\nfor their friend, and were not slow to come to him.\n\nIn person Captain Cuttwater was a tall, heavy man, on whose iron\nconstitution hogsheads of Hollands and water seemed to have had no very\npowerful effect. He was much given to profane oaths; but knowing that\nmanners required that he should refrain before ladies, and being unable\nto bring his tongue sufficiently under command to do so, he was in the\nhabit of 'craving the ladies' pardon' after every slip.\n\nAll that was really remarkable in Uncle Bat's appearance was included in\nhis nose. It had always been a generous, weighty, self-confident nose,\ninviting to itself more observation than any of its brother features\ndemanded. But in latter years it had spread itself out in soft, porous,\nred excrescences, to such an extent as to make it really deserving of\nconsiderable attention. No stranger ever passed Captain Cuttwater in\nthe streets of Devonport without asking who he was, or, at any rate,\nspecially noticing him.\n\nIt must, of course, be admitted that a too strongly pronounced\npartiality for alcoholic drink had produced these defects in Captain\nCuttwater's nasal organ; and yet he was a most staunch friend of\ntemperance. No man alive or dead had ever seen Captain Cuttwater the\nworse for liquor; at least so boasted the captain himself, and there\nwere none, at any rate in Devonport, to give him the lie. Woe betide the\nmidshipman whom he should see elated with too much wine; and even to the\ncommon sailor who should be tipsy at the wrong time, he would show\nno mercy. Most eloquent were the discourses which he preached against\ndrunkenness, and they always ended with a reference to his own sobriety.\nThe truth was, that drink would hardly make Captain Cuttwater drunk. It\nleft his brain untouched, but punished his nose.\n\nMrs. Woodward had seen her uncle but once since she had become a widow.\nHe had then come up to London to attack the Admiralty at close quarters,\nand had sojourned for three or four days at Surbiton Cottage. This was\nnow some ten years since, and the girls had forgotten even what he was\nlike. Great preparations were made for him. Though the summer had nearly\ncommenced, a large fire was kept burning in his bedroom--his bed was\nnewly hung with new curtains; two feather beds were piled on each\nother, and everything was done which five women could think desirable\nto relieve the ailings of suffering age. The fact, however, was that\nCaptain Cuttwater was accustomed to a small tent bedstead in a room\nwithout a carpet, that he usually slept on a single mattress, and that\nhe never had a fire in his bedroom, even in the depth of winter.\n\nTravelling from Devonport to London is now an easy matter; and Captain\nCuttwater, old as he was, found himself able to get through to Hampton\nin one day. Mrs. Woodward went to meet him at Hampton Court in a fly,\nand conveyed him to his new home, together with a carpet-bag, a cocked\nhat, a sword, and a very small portmanteau. When she inquired after the\nremainder of his luggage, he asked her what more lumber she supposed\nhe wanted. No more lumber at any rate made its appearance, then or\nafterwards; and the fly proceeded with an easy load to Surbiton Cottage.\n\nThere was great anxiety on the part of the girls when the wheels were\nheard to stop at the front door. Gertrude kept her place steadily\nstanding on the rug in the drawing-room; Linda ran to the door and\nthen back again; but Katie bolted out and ensconced herself behind the\nparlour-maid, who stood at the open door, looking eagerly forth to get\nthe first view of Uncle Bat.\n\n'So here you are, Bessie, as snug as ever,' said the captain, as he let\nhimself ponderously down from the fly. Katie had never before heard her\nmother called Bessie, and had never seen anything approaching in size or\ncolour to such a nose, consequently she ran away frightened.\n\n'That's Gertrude--is it?' said the captain.\n\n'Gertrude, uncle! Why Gertrude is a grown-up woman now. That's Katie,\nwhom you remember an infant.'\n\n'God bless my soul!' said the captain, as though he thought that\ngirls must grow twice quicker at Hampton than they did at Devonport or\nelsewhere, 'God bless my soul!'\n\nHe was then ushered into the drawing-room, and introduced in form to his\ngrand-nieces. 'This is Gertrude, uncle, and this Linda; there is just\nenough difference for you to know them apart. And this Katie. Come here,\nKatie, and kiss your uncle.'\n\nKatie came up, hesitated, looked horrified, but did manage to get her\nface somewhat close to the old man's without touching the tremendous\nnose, and then having gone through this peril she retreated again behind\nthe sofa.\n\n'Well; bless my stars, Bessie, you don't tell me those are your\nchildren?'\n\n'Indeed, uncle, I believe they are. It's a sad tale for me to tell, is\nit not?' said the blooming mother with a laugh.\n\n'Why, they'll be looking out for husbands next,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'Oh! they're doing that already, every day,' said Katie.\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Uncle Bat; 'I suppose so, I suppose so;--ha, ha,\nha!'\n\nGertrude turned away to the window, disgusted and angry, and made up her\nmind to hate Uncle Bat for ever afterwards. Linda made a little attempt\nto smile, and felt somewhat glad in her heart that her uncle was a man\nwho could indulge in a joke.\n\nHe was then taken upstairs to his bedroom, and here he greatly\nfrightened Katie, and much scandalized the parlour-maid by declaring,\nimmediately on his entering the room, that it was 'd----- hot, d---ation\nhot; craving your pardon, ladies!'\n\n'We thought, uncle, you'd like a fire,' began Mrs. Woodward, 'as----'\n\n'A fire in June, when I can hardly carry my coat on my back!'\n\n'It's the last day of May now,' said Katie timidly, from behind the\nbed-curtains.\n\nThis, however, did not satisfy the captain, and orders were forthwith\ngiven that the fire should be taken away, the curtains stripped off,\nthe feather beds removed, and everything reduced to pretty much the\nsame state in which it had usually been left for Harry Norman's\naccommodation. So much for all the feminine care which had been thrown\naway upon the consideration of Uncle Bat's infirmities.\n\n'God bless my soul!' said he, wiping his brow with a huge coloured\nhandkerchief as big as a mainsail, 'one night in such a furnace as that\nwould have brought on the gout.'\n\nHe had dined in town, and by the time that his chamber had been stripped\nof its appendages, he was nearly ready for bed. Before he did so, he was\nasked to take a glass of sherry.\n\n'Ah! sherry,' said he, taking up the bottle and putting it down again.\n'Sherry, ah! yes; very good wine, I am sure. You haven't a drop of rum\nin the house, have you?'\n\nMrs. Woodward declared with sorrow that she had not.\n\n'Or Hollands?' said Uncle Bat. But the ladies of Surbiton Cottage were\nunsupplied also with Hollands.\n\n'Gin?' suggested the captain, almost in despair.\n\nMrs. Woodward had no gin, but she could send out and get it; and the\nfirst evening of Captain Cuttwater's visit saw Mrs. Woodward's own\nparlour-maid standing at the bar of the Green Dragon, while two gills of\nspirits were being measured out for her.\n\n'Only for the respect she owed to Missus,' as she afterwards declared,\n'she never would have so demeaned herself for all the captains in the\nQueen's battalions.'\n\nThe captain, however, got his grog; and having enlarged somewhat\nvehemently while he drank it on the iniquities of those scoundrels\nat the Admiralty, took himself off to bed; and left his character and\npeculiarities to the tender mercies of his nieces.\n\nThe following day was Friday, and on the Saturday Norman and Tudor were\nto come down as a matter of course. During the long days, they usually\nmade their appearance after dinner; but they had now been specially\nrequested to appear in good orderly time, in honour of the captain.\nTheir advent had been of course spoken of, and Mrs. Woodward had\nexplained to Uncle Bat that her cousin Harry usually spent his Sundays\nat Hampton, and that he usually also brought with him a friend of his,\na Mr. Tudor. To all this, as a matter of course, Uncle Bat had as yet no\nobjection to make.\n\nThe young men came, and were introduced with due ceremony. Surbiton\nCottage, however, during dinnertime, was very unlike what it had been\nbefore, in the opinion of all the party there assembled. The girls\nfelt themselves called upon, they hardly knew why, to be somewhat less\nintimate in their manner with the young men than they customarily were;\nand Harry and Alaric, with quick instinct, reciprocated the feeling.\nMrs. Woodward, even, assumed involuntarily somewhat of a company air;\nand Uncle Bat, who sat at the bottom of the table, in the place usually\nassigned to Norman, was awkward in doing the honours of the house to\nguests who were in fact much more at home there than himself.\n\nAfter dinner the young people strolled out into the garden, and Katie,\nas was her wont, insisted on Harry Norman rowing her over to her damp\nparadise in the middle of the river. He attempted, vainly, to induce\nGertrude to accompany them. Gertrude was either coy with her lover,\nor indifferent; for very few were the occasions on which she could be\ninduced to gratify him with the rapture of a _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ encounter.\nSo that, in fact, Harry Norman's Sunday visits were generally moments\nof expected bliss of which the full fruition was but seldom attained. So\nwhile Katie went off to the island, Alaric and the two girls sat under\na spreading elm tree and watched the little boat as it shot across the\nwater. 'And what do you think of Uncle Bat?' said Gertrude.\n\n'Well, I am sure he's a good sort of fellow, and a very, gallant\nofficer, but--'\n\n'But what?' said Linda.\n\n'It's a thousand pities he should have ever been removed from Devonport,\nwhere I am sure he was both useful and ornamental.'\n\nBoth the girls laughed cheerily; and as the sound came across the water\nto Norman's ears, he repented himself of his good nature to Katie, and\ndetermined that her sojourn in the favourite island should, on this\noccasion, be very short.\n\n'But he is to pay mamma a great deal of money,' said Linda, 'and his\ncoming will be a great benefit to her in that way.'\n\n'There ought to be something to compensate for the bore,' said Gertrude.\n\n'We must only make the best of him,' said Alaric. 'For my part, I am\nrather fond of old gentlemen with long noses; but it seemed to me that\nhe was not quite so fond of us. I thought he looked rather shy at Harry\nand me.'\n\nBoth the girls protested against this, and declared that there could be\nnothing in it.\n\n'Well, now, I'll tell you what, Gertrude,' said Alaric, 'I am quite sure\nthat he looks on me, especially, as an interloper; and yet I'll bet you\na pair of gloves I am his favourite before a month is over.'\n\n'Oh, no; Linda is to be his favourite,' said Gertrude.\n\n'Indeed I am not,' said Linda. 'I liked him very well till he drank\nthree huge glasses of gin-and-water last night, but I never can fancy\nhim after that. You can't conceive, Alaric, what the drawing-room smelt\nlike. I suppose he'll do the same every evening.'\n\n'Well, what can you expect?' said Gertrude; 'if mamma will have an old\nsailor to live with her, of course he'll drink grog.'\n\nWhile this was going on in the garden, Mrs. Woodward sat dutifully\nwith her uncle while he sipped his obnoxious toddy, and answered his\nquestions about their two friends.\n\n'They were both in the Weights and Measures, by far the most respectable\npublic office in London,' as she told him, 'and both doing extremely\nwell there. They were, indeed, young men sure to distinguish themselves\nand get on in the world. Had this not been so, she might perhaps have\nhesitated to receive them so frequently, and on such intimate terms, at\nSurbiton Cottage.' This she said in a half-apologetic manner, and\nyet with a feeling of anger at herself that she should condescend to\napologize to any one as to her own conduct in her own house.\n\n'They are very nice young men, I am sure,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'Indeed they are,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'And very civil to the young ladies,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'They have known them since they were children, uncle; and of course\nthat makes them more intimate than young men generally are with young\nladies;' and again Mrs. Woodward was angry with herself for making any\nexcuses on the subject.\n\n'Are they well off?' asked the prudent captain.\n\n'Harry Norman is very well off; he has a private fortune. Both of them\nhave excellent situations.'\n\n'To my way of thinking that other chap is the better fellow. At any rate\nhe seems to have more gumption about him.'\n\n'Why, uncle, you don't mean to tell me that you think Harry Norman a\nfool?' said Mrs. Woodward. Harry Norman was Mrs. Woodward's special\nfriend, and she fondly indulged the hope of seeing him in time become\nthe husband of her elder and favourite daughter; if, indeed, she can be\nfairly said to have had a favourite child.\n\nCaptain Cuttwater poured out another glass of rum, and dropped the\nsubject.\n\nSoon afterwards the whole party came in from the lawn. Katie was all\ndraggled and wet, for she had persisted in making her way right across\nthe island to look out for a site for another palace. Norman was a\nlittle inclined to be sulky, for Katie had got the better of him; when\nshe had got out of the boat, he could not get her into it again; and as\nhe could not very well leave her in the island, he had been obliged to\nremain paddling about, while he heard the happy voices of Alaric and the\ntwo girls from the lawn. Alaric was in high good-humour, and entered the\nroom intent on his threatened purpose of seducing Captain Cuttwater's\naffections. The two girls were both blooming with happy glee, and\nGertrude was especially bright in spite of the somewhat sombre demeanour\nof her lover.\n\nTea was brought in, whereupon Captain Cuttwater, having taken a bit of\ntoast and crammed it into his saucer, fell fast asleep in an arm-chair.\n\n'You'll have very little opportunity to-night,' said Linda, almost in a\nwhisper.\n\n'Opportunity for what?' asked Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Hush,' said Gertrude, 'we'll tell you by and by, mamma. You'll wake\nUncle Bat if you talk now.'\n\n'I am so thirsty,' said Katie, bouncing into the room with dry shoes and\nstockings on. 'I am so thirsty. Oh, Linda, do give me some tea.'\n\n'Hush,' said Alaric, pointing to the captain, who was thoroughly\nenjoying himself, and uttering sonorous snores at regular fixed\nintervals.\n\n'Sit down, Katie, and don't make a noise,' said Mrs. Woodward, gently.\n\nKatie slunk into a chair, opened wide her large bright eyes, applied\nherself diligently to her tea-cup, and then, after taking breath, said,\nin a very audible whisper to her sister, 'Are not we to talk at all,\nLinda? That will be very dull, I think.'\n\n'Yes, my dear, you are to talk as much as you please, and as often as\nyou please, and as loud as you please; that is to say, if your mamma\nwill let you,' said Captain Cuttwater, without any apparent waking\neffort, and in a moment the snoring was going on again as regularly as\nbefore.\n\nKatie looked round, and again opened her eyes and laughed. Mrs. Woodward\nsaid, 'You are very good-natured, uncle.' The girls exchanged looks with\nAlaric, and Norman, who had not yet recovered his good-humour, went on\nsipping his tea.\n\nAs soon as the tea-things were gone, Uncle Bat yawned and shook himself,\nand asked if it was not nearly time to go to bed.\n\n'Whenever you like, Uncle Bat,' said Mrs. Woodward, who began to find\nthat she agreed with Gertrude, that early habits on the part of her\nuncle would be a family blessing. 'But perhaps you'll take something\nbefore you go?'\n\n'Well, I don't mind if I do take a thimbleful of rum-and-water.' So the\nodious spirit-bottle was again brought into the drawing-room.\n\n'Did you call at the Admiralty, sir, as you came through town?' said\nAlaric.\n\n'Call at the Admiralty, sir!' said the captain, turning sharply round\nat the questioner; 'what the deuce should I call at the Admiralty for?\ncraving the ladies' pardon.'\n\n'Well, indeed, I don't know,' said Alaric, not a bit abashed. 'But\nsailors always do call there, for the pleasure, I suppose, of kicking\ntheir heels in the lords' waiting-room.'\n\n'I have done with that game,' said Captain Cuttwater, now wide awake;\nand in his energy he poured half a glass more rum into his beaker. 'I've\ndone with that game, and I'll tell you what, Mr. Tudor, if I had a dozen\nsons to provide for to-morrow--'\n\n'Oh, I do so wish you had,' said Katie; 'it would be such fun. Fancy\nUncle Bat having twelve sons, Gertrude. What would you call them all,\nuncle?'\n\n'Why, I tell you what, Miss Katie, I wouldn't call one of them a sailor.\nI'd sooner make tailors of them.'\n\n'Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, gentleman, apothecary, ploughboy,\nthief,' said Katie. 'That would only be eight; what should the other\nfour be, uncle?'\n\n'You're quite right, Captain Cuttwater,' said Alaric, 'at least as far\nas the present moment goes; but the time is coming when things at the\nAdmiralty will be managed very differently.'\n\n'Then I'm d---- if that time can come too soon--craving the ladies'\npardon!' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'I don't know what you mean, Alaric,' said Harry Norman, who was just at\npresent somewhat disposed to contradict his friend, and not ill-inclined\nto contradict the captain also; 'as far as I can judge, the Admiralty is\nthe very last office the Government will think of touching.'\n\n'The Government!' shouted Captain Cuttwater; 'oh! if we are to wait for\nthe Government, the navy may go to the deuce, sir.'\n\n'It's the pressure from without that must do the work,' said Alaric.\n\n'Pressure from without!' said Norman, scornfully; 'I hate to hear such\ntrash.'\n\n'We'll see, young gentleman, we'll see,' said the captain; 'it may be\ntrash, and it may be right that five fellows who never did the Queen a\nday's service in their life, should get fifteen hundred or two thousand\na year, and have the power of robbing an old sailor like me of the\nreward due to me for sixty years' hard work. Reward! no; but the very\nwages that I have actually earned. Look at me now, d---- me, look at me!\nHere I am, Captain Cuttwater--with sixty years' service--and I've done\nmore perhaps for the Queen's navy than--than--'\n\n'It's too true, Captain Cuttwater,' said Alaric, speaking with a sort\nof mock earnestness which completely took in the captain, but stealing a\nglance at the same time at the two girls, who sat over their work at the\ndrawing-room table, 'it's too true; and there's no doubt the whole\nthing must be altered, and that soon. In the first place, we must have a\nsailor at the head of the navy.'\n\n'Yes,' said the captain, 'and one that knows something about it too.'\n\n'You'll never have a sailor sitting as first lord,' said Norman,\nauthoritatively; 'unless it be when some party man, high in rank, may\nhappen to have been in the navy as a boy.'\n\n'And why not?' said Captain Cuttwater quite angrily.\n\n'Because the first lord must sit in the Cabinet, and to do that he must\nbe a thorough politician.'\n\n'D---- politicians! craving the ladies' pardon,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'Amen!' said Alaric.\n\nUncle Bat, thinking that he had thoroughly carried his point, finished\nhis grog, took up his candlestick, and toddled off to bed.\n\n'Well, I think I have done something towards carrying my point,' said\nAlaric.\n\n'I didn't think you were half so cunning,' said Linda, laughing.\n\n'I cannot think how you can condescend to advocate opinions\ndiametrically opposed to your own convictions,' said Norman, somewhat\nhaughtily.\n\n'Fee, fo, fum!' said Alaric.\n\n'What is it all about?' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Alaric wants to do all he can to ingratiate himself with Uncle Bat,'\nsaid Gertrude; 'and I am sure he's going the right way to work.'\n\n'It's very good-natured on his part,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'I don't know what you are talking about,' said Katie, yawning, 'and I\nthink you are all very stupid; so I'll go to bed.'\n\nThe rest soon followed her. They did not sit up so late chatting over\nthe fire this evening, as was their wont on Saturdays, though none of\nthem knew what cause prevented it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBUSHEY PARK\n\n\nThe next day being Sunday, the whole party very properly went to church;\nbut during the sermon Captain Cuttwater very improperly went to sleep,\nand snored ponderously the whole time. Katie was so thoroughly shocked\nthat she did not know which way to look; Norman, who had recovered his\ngood-humour, and Alaric, could not refrain from smiling as they caught\nthe eyes of the two girls; and Mrs. Woodward made sundry little abortive\nefforts to wake her uncle with her foot. Altogether abortive they were\nnot, for the captain would open his eyes and gaze at her for a moment\nin the most good-natured, lack-lustre manner conceivable; but then, in a\nmoment, he would be again asleep and snoring, with all the regularity of\na kitchen-clock. This was at first very dreadful to the Woodwards; but\nafter a month or two they got used to it, and so apparently did the\npastor and the people of Hampton.\n\nAfter church there was a lunch of course; and then, according to their\nwont, they went out to walk. These Sunday walks in general were matters\nof some difficulty. The beautiful neighbourhood of Hampton Court, with\nits palace-gardens and lovely park, is so popular with Londoners that it\nis generally alive on that day with a thronged multitude of men, women,\nand children, and thus becomes not an eligible resort for lovers of\nprivacy. Captain Cuttwater, however, on this occasion, insisted on\nseeing the chestnuts and the crowd, and consequently, they all went into\nBushey Park.\n\nUncle Bat, who professed himself to be a philanthropist, and who was\nalso a bit of a democrat, declared himself delighted with what he saw.\nIt was a great thing for the London citizens to come down there with\ntheir wives and children, and eat their dinners in the open air under\nthe spreading trees; and both Harry and Alaric agreed with him. Mrs.\nWoodward, however, averred that it would be much better if they would\ngo to church first, and Gertrude and Linda were of opinion that the Park\nwas spoilt by the dirty bits of greasy paper which were left about on\nall sides. Katie thought it very hard that, as all the Londoners were\nallowed to eat their dinners in the Park, she might not have hers there\nalso. To which Captain Cuttwater rejoined that he should give them a\npicnic at Richmond before the summer was over.\n\nAll the world knows how such a party as that of our friends by degrees\nseparates itself into twos and threes, when sauntering about in shady\nwalks. It was seldom, indeed, that Norman could induce his Dulcinea to\nbe so complaisant in his favour; but either accident or kindness on her\npart favoured him on this occasion, and as Katie went on eliciting from\nUncle Bat fresh promises as to the picnic, Harry and Gertrude found\nthemselves together under one avenue of trees, while Alaric and Linda\nwere equally fortunate, or unfortunate, under another.\n\n'I did so wish to speak a few words to you, Gertrude,' said Norman; 'but\nit seems as though, now that this captain has come among us, all our old\nhabits and ways are to be upset.'\n\n'I don't see that _you_ need say that,' said she. 'We may, perhaps, be\nput out a little--that is, mamma and Linda and I; but I do not see that\nyou need suffer.'\n\n'Suffer--no, not suffer--and yet it is suffering.'\n\n'What is suffering?' said she.\n\n'Why, to be as we were last night--not able to speak to each other.'\n\n'Come, Harry, you should be a little reasonable,' said she, laughing.\n'If you did not talk last night whose fault was it?'\n\n'I suppose you will say it was my own. Perhaps it was. But I could not\nfeel comfortable while he was drinking gin-and-water--'\n\n'It was rum,' said Gertrude, rather gravely.\n\n'Well, rum-and-water in your mother's drawing-room, and cursing and\nswearing before you and Linda, as though he were in the cockpit of a\nman-of-war.'\n\n'Alaric you saw was able to make himself happy, and I am sure he is not\nmore indifferent to us than you are.'\n\n'Alaric seemed to me to be bent on making a fool of the old man; and, to\ntell the truth, I cannot approve of his doing so.'\n\n'It seems to me, Harry, that you do not approve of what any of us\nare doing,' said she; 'I fear we are all in your black books--Captain\nCuttwater, and mamma, and Alaric, and I, and all of us.'\n\n'Well now, Gertrude, do you mean to say you think it right that Katie\nshould sit by and hear a man talk as Captain Cuttwater talked last\nnight? Do you mean to say that the scene which passed, with the rum and\nthe curses, and the absurd ridicule which was thrown on your mother's\nuncle, was such as should take place in your mother's drawing-room?'\n\n'I mean to say, Harry, that my mother is the best and only judge of what\nshould, and what should not, take place there.'\n\nNorman felt himself somewhat silenced by this, and walked on for a\ntime without speaking. He was a little too apt to take upon himself the\ncharacter of Mentor; and, strange to say, he was aware of his own fault\nin this particular. Thus, though the temptation to preach was very\npowerful, he refrained himself for a while. His present desire was to\nsay soft things rather than sharp words; and though lecturing was at\nthis moment much easier to him than love-making, he bethought himself\nof his object, and controlled the spirit of morality which was strong\nwithin him.\n\n'But we were so happy before your uncle came,' he said, speaking with\nhis sweetest voice, and looking at the beautiful girl beside him with\nall the love he was able to throw into his handsome face.\n\n'And we are happy now that he has come--or at any rate ought to be,'\nsaid Gertrude, doing a little in the Mentor line herself, now that the\noccasion came in her way.\n\n'Ah! Gertrude, you know very well there is only one thing can make me\nhappy,' said Harry.\n\n'Why, you unreasonable man! just now you said you were perfectly happy\nbefore Captain Cuttwater came, I suppose the one thing now necessary is\nto send him away again.'\n\n'No, Gertrude, the thing necessary is to take you away.'\n\n'What! out of the contamination of poor old Uncle Bat's bottle of rum?\nBut, Harry, you see it would be cowardly in me to leave mamma and Linda\nto suffer the calamity alone.'\n\n'I wonder, Gertrude, whether, in your heart of hearts, you really care\na straw about me,' said Harry, who was now very sentimental and somewhat\nlachrymose.\n\n'You know we all care very much about you, and it is very wrong in\nyou to express such a doubt,' said Gertrude, with a duplicity that\nwas almost wicked; as if she did not fully understand that the kind of\n'caring' of which Norman spoke was of a very different nature from the\ngeneral 'caring' which she, on his behalf, shared with the rest of her\nfamily.\n\n'All of you--yes, but I am not speaking of all of you; I am speaking of\nyou, Gertrude--you in particular. Can you ever love me well enough to be\nmy wife?'\n\n'Well, there is no knowing what I may be able to do in three or four\nyears' time; but even that must depend very much on how you behave\nyourself in the mean time. If you get cross because Captain Cuttwater\nhas come here, and snub Alaric and Linda, as you did last night, and\nscold at mamma because she chooses to let her own uncle live in her own\nhouse, why, to tell you the truth, I don't think I ever shall.'\n\nAll persons who have a propensity to lecture others have a strong\nconstitutional dislike to being lectured themselves. Such was decidedly\nthe case with Harry Norman. In spite of his strong love, and his anxious\ndesire to make himself agreeable, his brow became somewhat darkened, and\nhis lips somewhat compressed. He would not probably have been annoyed\nhad he not been found fault with for snubbing his friend Tudor. Why\nshould Gertrude, his Gertrude, put herself forward to defend his friend?\nLet her say what she chose for her mother, or even for her profane,\ndram-drinking, vulgar old uncle, but it was too much that she should\ntake up the cudgels for Alaric Tudor.\n\n'Well,' said he, 'I was annoyed last night, and I must own it. It\ngrieved me to hear Alaric turning your uncle into ridicule, and that\nbefore your mother's face; and it grieved me to see you and Linda\nencourage him. In what Alaric said about the Admiralty he did not speak\ntruthfully.'\n\n'Do you mean to say that Alaric said what was false?'\n\n'Inasmuch as he was pretending to express his own opinion, he did say\nwhat was false.'\n\n'Then I must and will say that I never yet knew Alaric say a word that\nwas not true; and, which is more, I am quite sure that he would not\naccuse you of falsehood behind your back in a fit of jealousy.'\n\n'Jealousy!' said Norman, looking now as black as grim death itself.\n\n'Yes, it is jealousy. It so turned out that Alaric got on better last\nnight with Captain Cuttwater than you did, and that makes you jealous.'\n\n'Pish!' said Norman, somewhat relieved, but still sufficiently disgusted\nthat his lady-love should suppose that he could be otherwise than\nsupremely indifferent to the opinion of Captain Cuttwater.\n\nThe love-scene, however, was fatally interrupted; and the pair were not\nlong before they joined the captain, Mrs. Woodward, and Katie.\n\nAnd how fared it with the other pair under the other avenue of\nchestnuts?\n\nAlaric Tudor had certainly come out with no defined intention of making\nlove as Harry Norman had done; but with such a companion it was very\ndifficult for him to avoid it. Linda was much more open to attacks\nof this nature than her sister. Not that she was as a general rule\nwillingly and wilfully inclined to give more encouragement to lovers\nthan Gertrude; but she had less power of fence, less skill in protecting\nherself, and much less of that naughty self-esteem which makes some\nwomen fancy that all love-making to them is a liberty, and the want of\nwhich makes others feel that all love-making is to them a compliment.\n\nAlaric Tudor had no defined intention of making love; but he had a sort\nof suspicion that he might, if he pleased, do so successfully; and\nhe had no defined intention of letting it alone. He was a far-seeing,\nprudent man; for his age perhaps too prudent; but he was nevertheless\nfully susceptible of the pleasure of holding an affectionate, close\nintercourse with so sweet a girl as Linda Woodward; and though he knew\nthat marriage with a girl without a dowry would for him be a death-blow\nto all his high hopes, he could hardly resist the temptation of\nconjugating the verb to love. Had he been able to choose from the two\nsisters, he would probably have selected Gertrude in spite of what\nhe had said to Norman in the boat; but Gertrude was bespoken; and it\ntherefore seemed all but unnatural that there should not be some love\npassages between him and Linda.\n\nAh! Mrs. Woodward, my friend, my friend, was it well that thou shouldst\nleave that sweet unguarded rosebud of thine to such perils as these?\n\nThey, also, commenced their wooing by talking over Captain Cuttwater;\nbut they did not quarrel over him. Linda was quite content to be told\nby her friend what she ought to do, and how she ought to think about her\nuncle; and Alaric had a better way of laying down the law than Norman.\nHe could do so without offending his hearer's pride, and consequently\nwas generally better listened to than his friend, though his law was\nprobably not in effect so sound.\n\nBut they had soon done with Captain Cuttwater, and Alaric had to choose\nanother subject. Gertrude and Norman were at some distance from them,\nbut were in sight and somewhat in advance.\n\n'Look at Harry,' said Alaric; 'I know from the motion of his shoulder\nthat he is at this moment saying something very tender.'\n\n'It is ten times more likely that they are quarrelling,' said Linda.\n\n'Oh! the quarrels of lovers--we know all about that, don't we?'\n\n'You must not call them lovers, Alaric; mamma would not like it, nor\nindeed would Gertrude, I am sure.'\n\n'I would not for the world do anything that Mrs. Woodward would not\nlike; but between ourselves, Linda, are they not lovers?'\n\n'No; that is, not that I know of. I don't believe that they are a bit,'\nsaid Linda, blushing at her own fib.\n\n'And why should they not be? How indeed is it possible that they\nshould not be; that is--for I heartily beg Gertrude's pardon--how is it\npossible that Harry should not be in love with her?'\n\n'Indeed, Gertrude is very, very beautiful,' said Linda, with the\nfaintest possible sigh, occasioned by the remembrance of her own\ninferior charms.\n\n'Indeed she is, very, very beautiful,' repeated Alaric, speaking with\nan absent air as though his mind were fully engaged in thinking of the\nbeauty of which he spoke.\n\nIt was not in Linda's nature to be angry because her sister was admired,\nand because she was not. But yet there was something in Alaric's warm\ntone of admiration which gave her a feeling of unhappiness which she\nwould have been quite unable to define, even had she attempted it. She\nsaw her sister and Harry Norman before her, and she knew in her heart\nthat they were lovers, in spite of her little weak declaration to the\ncontrary. She saw how earnestly her sister was loved, and she in\nher kindly loving nature could not but envy her fancied happiness.\nEnvy--no--it certainly was not envy. She would not for worlds have\nrobbed her sister of her admirer; but it was so natural for her to feel\nthat it must be delicious to be admired!\n\nShe did not begrudge Gertrude Norman's superior beauty, nor his greater\nwealth; she knew that Gertrude was entitled to more, much more, than\nherself. But seeing that Norman was Gertrude's lover, was it not natural\nthat Alaric should be hers? And then, though Harry was the handsomer and\nthe richer, she liked Alaric so much the better of the two. But now that\nAlaric was alone with her, the only subject he could think to talk of\nwas Gertrude's beauty!\n\nIt must not be supposed that these thoughts in their plainly-developed\nform passed through Linda's mind. It was not that she thought all this,\nbut that she felt it. Such feelings are quite involuntary, whereas one's\nthoughts are more or less under command. Linda would not have allowed\nherself to think in this way for worlds; but she could not control her\nfeelings.\n\nThey walked on side by side, perfectly silent for a minute or two, and\nan ill-natured tear was gathering itself in the corner of Linda's eye:\nshe was afraid even to raise her hand to brush it away, for fear Alaric\nshould see her, and thus it went on gathering till it was like to fall.\n\n'How singular it is,' said Alaric--'how very singular, the way in which\nI find myself living with you all! such a perfect stranger as I am.'\n\n'A perfect stranger!' said Linda, who, having remembered Alaric since\nthe days of her short frocks and lessons, looked on him as a very old\nfriend indeed.\n\n'Yes, a perfect stranger, if you think of it. What do any of you know\nabout me? Your mother never saw my mother; your father knew nothing of\nmy father; there is no kindred blood common to us. Harry Norman, there,\nis your near cousin; but what am I that I should be thus allowed to\nlive with you, and walk with you, and have a common interest in all your\ndoings?'\n\n'Why, you are a dear friend of mamma's, are you not?'\n\n'A dear friend of mamma's! said he, 'well, indeed, I hope I am; for your\nmother is at any rate a dear friend to me. But, Linda, one cannot be so\nmuch without longing to be more. Look at Harry, how happy he is!'\n\n'But, Alaric, surely you would not interfere with Harry,' said Linda,\nwhose humble, innocent heart thought still of nothing but the merits of\nher sister; and then, remembering that it was necessary that she should\nadmit nothing on Gertrude's behalf, she entered her little protest\nagainst the assumption that her sister acknowledged Norman for her\nlover. 'That is, you would not do so, if there were anything in it.'\n\n'I interfere with Harry!' said Alaric, switching the heads off the bits\nof fern with the cane he carried. 'No, indeed. I have no wish at all to\ndo that. It is not that of which I was thinking. Harry is welcome to all\nhis happiness; that is, if Gertrude can be brought to make him happy.'\n\nLinda, made no answer now; but the tear came running down her face, and\nher eyes became dim, and her heart beat very quick, and she didn't quite\nremember where she was. Up to this moment no man had spoken a word of\nlove to Linda Woodward, and to some girls the first word is very trying.\n\n'Interfere with Harry!' Alaric repeated again, and renewed his attack on\nthe ferns. 'Well, Linda, what an opinion you must have of me!'\n\nLinda was past answering; she could not protest--nor would it have\nbeen expedient to do so--that her opinion of her companion was not\nunfavourable.\n\n'Gertrude is beautiful, very beautiful,' he continued, still beating\nabout the bush as modest lovers do, and should do; 'but she is not the\nonly beautiful girl in Surbiton Cottage, nor to my eyes is she the most\nso.'\n\nLinda was now quite beside herself. She knew that decorum required that\nshe should say something stiff and stately to repress such language, but\nif all her future character for propriety had depended on it, she\ncould not bring herself to say a word. She knew that Gertrude, when so\naddressed, would have maintained her dignity, and have concealed her\nsecret, even if she allowed herself to have a secret to conceal. She\nknew that it behoved her to be repellent and antagonistic to the first\nvows of a first lover. But, alas! she had no power of antagonism, no\nenergy for repulse left in her. Her knees seemed to be weak beneath her,\nand all she could do was to pluck to pieces the few flowers that she\ncarried at her waist.\n\nAlaric saw his advantage, but was too generous to push it closely; nor\nindeed did he choose to commit himself to all the assured intentions of\na positive declaration. He wished to raise an interest in Linda's heart,\nand having done so, to leave the matter to chance. Something, however,\nit was necessary that he should say. He walked a while by her in\nsilence, decapitating the ferns, and then coming close to her, he said--\n\n'Linda, dear Linda! you are not angry with me?' Linda, however, answered\nnothing. 'Linda, dearest Linda! speak one word to me.'\n\n'Don't!' said Linda through her tears. 'Pray don't, Alaric; pray don't.'\n\n'Well, Linda, I will not say another word to you now. Let us walk\ngently; we shall catch them up quite in time before they leave the\npark.'\n\nAnd so they sauntered on, exchanging no further words. Linda by degrees\nrecovered her calmness, and as she did so, she found herself to be, oh!\nso happy. She had never, never envied Gertrude her lover; but it was so\nsweet, so very sweet, to be able to share her sister's happiness.\nAnd Alaric, was he also happy? At the moment he doubtless enjoyed the\ntriumph of his success. But still he had a feeling of sad care at his\nheart. How was he to marry a girl without a shilling? Were all his high\nhopes, was all his soaring ambition, to be thrown over for a dream of\nlove?\n\nAh! Mrs. Woodward, my friend, my friend, thou who wouldst have fed thy\nyoung ones, like the pelican, with blood from thine own breast, had such\nfeeding been of avail; thou who art the kindest of mothers; has it been\nwell for thee to subject to such perils this poor weak young dove of\nthine?\n\nUncle Bat had become tired with his walk, and crawled home so slowly\nthat Alaric and Linda caught the party just as they reached the small\nwicket which leads out of the park on the side nearest to Hampton.\nNothing was said or thought of their absence, and they all entered the\nhouse together. Four of them, however, were conscious that that Sunday's\nwalk beneath the chestnuts of Bushey Park would long be remembered.\n\nNothing else occurred to make the day memorable. In the evening, after\ndinner, Mrs. Woodward and her daughters went to church, leaving her\nyounger guests to entertain the elder one. The elder one soon took the\nmatter in his own hand by going to sleep; and Harry and Alaric being\nthus at liberty, sauntered out down the river side. They both made a\nforced attempt at good-humour, each speaking cheerily to the other; but\nthere was no confidence between them as there had been on that morning\nwhen Harry rowed his friend up to London. Ah me! what had occurred\nbetween them to break the bonds of their mutual trust--to quench the\nardour of their firm friendship? But so it was between them now. It was\nfated that they never again should place full confidence in each other.\n\nThere was no such breach between the sisters, at least not as yet; but\neven between them there was no free and full interchange of their\nhopes and fears. Gertrude and Linda shared the same room, and were\naccustomed--as what girls are not?--to talk half through the night of\nall their wishes, thoughts, and feelings. And Gertrude was generally\nprone enough to talk of Harry Norman. Sometimes she would say she loved\nhim a little, just a little; at others she would declare that she loved\nhim not at all--that is, not as heroines love in novels, not as she\nthought she could love, and would do, should it ever be her lot to be\nwooed by such a lover as her young fancy pictured to her. Then she\nwould describe her beau id\u00c3\u00a9al, and the description certainly gave no\ncounterpart of Harry Norman. To tell the truth, however, Gertrude was as\nyet heart whole; and when she talked of love and Harry Norman, she did\nnot know what love was.\n\nOn this special Sunday evening she was disinclined to speak of him at\nall. Not that she loved him more than usual, but that she was beginning\nto think that she could not ever really love him at all. She had taught\nherself to think that he might probably be her husband, and had hitherto\nfelt no such repugnance to her destiny as caused her to shun the\nsubject. But now she was beginning to think of the matter seriously; and\nas she did so, she felt that life might have for her a lot more blessed\nthan that of sharing the world with her cousin Harry.\n\nWhen, therefore, Linda began to question her about her lover, and to\nmake little hints of her desire to tell what Alaric had said of her and\nNorman, Gertrude gave her no encouragement. She would speak of Captain\nCuttwater, of Katie's lessons, of the new dress they were to make for\ntheir mother, of Mr. Everscreech's long sermon, of anything in fact but\nof Harry Norman.\n\nNow this was very hard on poor Linda. Her heart was bursting within her\nto tell her sister that she also was beloved; but she could not do so\nwithout some little encouragement.\n\nIn all their conferences she took the cue of the conversation from her\nsister; and though she could have talked about Alaric by the hour, if\nGertrude would have consented to talk about Harry, she did not know how\nto start the subject of her own lover, while Gertrude was so cold\nand uncommunicative as to hers. She struggled very hard to obtain the\nprivilege for which she so anxiously longed; but in doing so she only\nmet with a sad and sore rebuff.\n\n'Gertrude,' at last said Linda, when Gertrude thought that the subject\nhad been put to rest at any rate for that night, 'don't you think mamma\nwould be pleased if she knew that you had engaged yourself to Harry\nNorman?'\n\n'No,' said Gertrude, evincing her strong mind by the tone in which she\nspoke; 'I do not. If mamma wished it, she would have told me; for she\nnever has any secrets. I should be as wrong to engage myself with Harry\nas you would be with Alaric. For though Harry has property of his own,\nwhile poor Alaric has none, he has a very insufficient income for a\nmarried man, and I have no fortune with which to help him. If nothing\nelse prevented it, I should consider it wicked in me to make myself a\nburden to a man while he is yet so young and comparatively so poor.'\n\nPrudent, sensible, high-minded, well-disciplined Gertrude! But had her\nheart really felt a spark of love for the man of whom she spoke, how\nmuch would prudent, sensible, high-minded considerations have weighed\nwith her? Alas! not a feather.\n\nHaving made her prudent, high-minded speech, she turned round and slept;\nand poor Linda also turned round and bedewed her pillow. She no longer\npanted to tell her sister of Alaric's love.\n\nOn the next morning the two young men returned to town, and the\ncustomary dullness of the week began.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nSIR GREGORY HARDLINES\n\n\nGreat changes had been going on at the Weights and Measures; or rather\nit might be more proper to say that great changes were now in progress.\nFrom that moment in which it had been hinted to Mr. Hardlines that he\nmust relax the rigour of his examinations, he had pondered deeply over\nthe matter. Hitherto he had confined his efforts to his own office, and,\nso far from feeling personally anxious for the amelioration of the Civil\nService generally, had derived no inconsiderable share of his happiness\nfrom the knowledge that there were such sinks of iniquity as the\nInternal Navigation. To be widely different from others was Mr.\nHardlines' glory. He was, perhaps, something of a Civil Service\nPharisee, and wore on his forehead a broad phylactery, stamped with\nthe mark of Crown property. He thanked God that he was not as those\npublicans at Somerset House, and took glory to himself in paying tithes\nof official cumin.\n\nBut now he was driven to a wider range. Those higher Pharisees who were\nabove him in his own pharisaical establishment, had interfered with the\nausterity of his worship. He could not turn against them there, on their\nown ground. He, of all men, could not be disobedient to official orders.\nBut if he could promote a movement beyond the walls of the Weights and\nMeasures; if he could make Pharisees of those benighted publicans in the\nStrand; if he could introduce conic sections into the Custom House, and\npolitical economy into the Post Office; if, by any effort of his, the\nForeign Office clerks could be forced to attend punctually at ten; and\nthat wretched saunterer, whom five days a week he saw lounging into the\nCouncil Office--if he could be made to mend his pace, what a wide field\nfor his ambition would Mr. Hardlines then have found!\n\nGreat ideas opened themselves to his mind as he walked to and from his\noffice daily. What if he could become the parent of a totally different\norder of things! What if the Civil Service, through his instrumentality,\nshould become the nucleus of the best intellectual diligence in\nthe country, instead of being a byword for sloth and ignorance! Mr.\nHardlines meditated deeply on this, and, as he did so, it became\nobserved on all sides that he was an altered man as regarded his\nsolicitude for the Weights and Measures. One or two lads crept in, by no\nmeans conspicuous for their attainments in abstract science; young men,\ntoo, were observed to leave not much after four o'clock, without calling\ndown on themselves Mr. Hardlines' usual sarcasm. Some said he was\ngrowing old, others that he was broken-hearted. But Mr. Hardlines was\nnot old, nor broken in heart or body. He was thinking of higher things\nthan the Weights and Measures, and at last he published a pamphlet.\n\nMr. Hardlines had many enemies, all in the Civil Service, one of the\nwarmest of whom was Mr. Oldeschole, of the Navigation, and at first they\nrejoiced greatly that Job's wish had been accomplished on their behalf,\nand that their enemy had written a book. They were down on Mr. Hardlines\nwith reviews, counter pamphlets, official statements, and indignant\ncontradiction; but Mr. Hardlines lived through this storm of missiles,\nand got his book to be f\u00c3\u00aated and made much of by some Government\npundits, who were very bigwigs indeed. And at last he was invited\nover to the building on the other side, to discuss the matter with\na President, a Secretary of State, a Lord Commissioner, two joint\nSecretaries, and three Chairmen.\n\nAnd then, for a period of six months, the light of Mr. Hardlines' face\nceased to shine on the children of the Weights and Measures, and they\nfelt, one and all, that the glory had in a certain measure departed from\ntheir house. Now and again Mr. Hardlines would look in, but he did\nso rather as an enemy than as a friend. There was always a gleam of\nantagonistic triumph in his eye, which showed that he had not forgotten\nthe day when he was called in question for his zeal. He was felt to be\nin opposition to his own Board, rather than in co-operation with it. The\nSecretary and the Assistant-Secretaries would say little caustic things\nabout him to the senior clerks, and seemed somewhat to begrudge him his\nnew honours. But for all this Mr. Hardlines cared little. The President\nand the Secretary of State, the joint Secretaries and the Chairmen, all\nallowed themselves to be led by him in this matter. His ambition was\nabout to be gratified. It was his destiny that he should remodel the\nCivil Service. What was it to him whether or no one insignificant office\nwould listen to his charming? Let the Secretary at the Weights and\nMeasures sneer as he would; he would make that hero of the metallic\ncurrency know that he, Mr. Hardlines, was his master.\n\nAt the end of six months his budding glory broke out into splendid,\nfull-blown, many-coloured flowers. He resigned his situation at the\nWeights and Measures, and was appointed Chief Commissioner of the Board\nof Civil Service Examination, with a salary of \u00c2\u00a32,000 a year; he was\nmade a K.C.B., and shone forth to the world as Sir Gregory Hardlines;\nand he received a present of \u00c2\u00a31,000, that happy _ne plus ultra_ of\nGovernmental liberality. Sir Gregory Hardlines was forced to acknowledge\nto himself that he was born to a great destiny.\n\nWhen Sir Gregory, as we must now call him, was first invited to give his\nattendance at another office, he found it expedient to take with him one\nof the young men from the Weights and Measures, and he selected Alaric\nTudor. Now this was surprising to many, for Tudor had been brought into\nthe office not quite in accordance with Sir Gregory's views. But during\nhis four years of service Alaric had contrived to smooth down any\nacerbity which had existed on this score; either the paper on the\nstrike-bushel, or his own general intelligence, or perhaps a certain\namount of flattery which he threw into his daily intercourse with the\nchief clerk, had been efficacious, and when Sir Gregory was called\nupon to select a man to take with him to his new temporary office, he\nselected Alaric Tudor.\n\nThe main effect which such selection had upon our story rises from\nthe circumstance that it led to an introduction between Tudor and the\nHonourable Undecimus Scott, and that this introduction brought about a\nclose alliance.\n\nWe will postpone for a short while such description of the character and\nposition of this gentleman as it may be indispensable to give, and will\nin this place merely say that the Honourable Undecimus Scott had been\nchosen to act as secretary to the temporary commission that was now\nmaking inquiry as to the proposed Civil Service examinations, and that\nin this capacity he was necessarily thrown into communication with\nTudor. He was a man who had known much of officialities, had filled\nmany situations, was acquainted with nearly all the secretaries,\nassistant-secretaries, and private secretaries in London, had been in\nParliament, and was still hand-and-glove with all young members who\nsupported Government. Tudor, therefore, thought it a privilege to know\nhim, and allowed himself to become, in a certain degree, subject to his\ninfluence.\n\nWhen it was declared to the world of Downing Street that Sir Gregory\nHardlines was to be a great man, to have an office of his own, and to\nreign over assistant-commissioners and subject secretaries, there was\ngreat commotion at the Weights and Measures; and when his letter\nof resignation was absolutely there, visible to the eyes of clerks,\nproperly docketed and duly minuted, routine business was, for a day,\nnearly suspended. Gentlemen walked in and out from each other's rooms,\nasking this momentous question--Who was to fill the chair which had so\nlong been honoured by the great Hardlines? Who was to be thought worthy\nto wear that divine mantle?\n\nBut even this was not the question of the greatest moment which at that\nperiod disturbed the peace of the office. It was well known that the\nchief clerk must be chosen from one of the three senior clerks, and that\nhe would be so chosen by the voice of the Commissioners. There were only\nthree men who were deeply interested in this question. But who would\nthen be the new senior clerk, and how would he be chosen? A strange\nrumour began to be afloat that the new scheme of competitive examination\nwas about to be tried in filling up this vacancy, occasioned by the\nwithdrawal of Sir Gregory Hardlines. From hour to hour the rumour gained\nground, and men's minds began to be much disturbed.\n\nIt was no wonder that men's minds should be disturbed. Competitive\nexaminations at eighteen, twenty, and twenty-two may be very well,\nand give an interesting stimulus to young men at college. But it is\na fearful thing for a married man with a family, who has long looked\nforward to rise to a certain income by the worth of his general conduct\nand by the value of his seniority--it is a fearful thing for such a one\nto learn that he has again to go through his school tricks, and fill up\nexamination papers, with all his juniors round him using their stoutest\nefforts to take his promised bread from out of his mouth. _Detur digno_\nis a maxim which will make men do their best to merit rewards; every man\ncan find courage within his heart to be worthy; but _detur digniori_ is\na fearful law for such a profession as the Civil Service. What worth\ncan make a man safe against the possible greater worth which will come\ntreading on his heels? The spirit of the age raises, from year to year,\nto a higher level the standard of education. The prodigy of 1857, who\nis now destroying all the hopes of the man who was well enough in 1855,\nwill be a dunce to the tyro of 1860.\n\nThere were three or four in the Weights and Measures who felt all this\nwith the keenest anxiety. The fact of their being there, and of their\nhaving passed the scrutiny of Mr. Hardlines, was proof enough that they\nwere men of high attainments; but then the question arose to them and\nothers whether they were men exactly of those attainments which were\n_now_ most required. Who is to say what shall constitute the merits of\nthe _dignior_? It may one day be conic sections, another Greek iambics,\nand a third German philosophy. Rumour began to say that foreign\nlanguages were now very desirable. The three excellent married gentlemen\nwho stood first in succession for the coveted promotion were great only\nin their vernacular.\n\nWithin a week from the secession of Sir Gregory, his immediate successor\nhad been chosen, and it had been officially declared that the vacant\nsituation in the senior class was to be thrown open as a prize for the\nbest man in the office. Here was a brilliant chance for young merit!\nThe place was worth \u00c2\u00a3600 a-year, and might be gained by any one who now\nreceived no more than \u00c2\u00a3100. Each person desirous of competing was to\nsend in his name to the Secretary, on or before that day fortnight; and\non that day month, the candidates were to present themselves before Sir\nGregory Hardlines and his board of Commissioners.\n\nAnd yet the joy of the office was by no means great. The senior of those\nwho might become competitors, was of course a miserable, disgusted man.\nHe went about fruitlessly endeavouring to instigate rebellion against\nSir Gregory, that very Sir Gregory whom he had for many years all but\nworshipped. Poor Jones was, to tell the truth, in a piteous case. He\ntold the Secretary flatly that he would not compete with a lot of\nboys fresh from school, and his friends began to think of removing his\nrazors. Nor were Brown and Robinson in much better plight. They both,\nit is true, hated Jones ruthlessly, and desired nothing better than\nan opportunity of supplanting him. They were, moreover, fast friends\nthemselves; but not the less on that account had Brown a mortal fear of\nRobinson, as also had Robinson a mortal fear of Brown.\n\nThen came the bachelors. First there was Uppinall, who, when he entered\nthe office, was supposed to know everything which a young man had ever\nknown. Those who looked most to dead knowledge were inclined to back him\nas first favourite. It had, however, been remarked, that his utility as\na clerk had not been equal to the profundity of his acquirements. Of all\nthe candidates he was the most self-confident.\n\nThe next to him was Mr. A. Minusex, a wondrous arithmetician. He was one\nwho could do as many sums without pen and paper as a learned pig; who\nwas so given to figures that he knew the number of stairs in every\nflight he had gone up and down in the metropolis; one who, whatever the\nsubject before him might be, never thought but always counted. Many who\nknew the peculiar propensities of Sir Gregory's earlier days thought\nthat Mr. Minusex was not an unlikely candidate.\n\nThe sixth in order was our friend Norman. The Secretary and the two\nAssistant-Secretaries, when they first put their heads together on the\nmatter, declared that he was the most useful man in the office.\n\nThere was a seventh, named Alphabet Precis. Mr. Precis' peculiar forte\nwas a singular happiness in official phraseology. Much that he wrote\nwould doubtless have been considered in the purlieus of Paternoster Row\nas ungrammatical, if not unintelligible; but according to the syntax of\nDowning Street, it was equal to Macaulay, and superior to Gibbon. He had\nfrequently said to his intimate friends, that in official writing,\nstyle was everything; and of his writing it certainly did form a very\nprominent part. He knew well, none perhaps so well, when to beg leave to\nlay before the Board--and when simply to submit to the Commissioners. He\nunderstood exactly to whom it behoved the secretary 'to have the honour\nof being a very humble servant,' and to whom the more simple 'I am,\nsir,' was a sufficiently civil declaration. These are qualifications\ngreat in official life, but were not quite so much esteemed at the time\nof which we are speaking as they had been some few years previously.\n\nThere was but one other named as likely to stand with any probability of\nsuccess, and he was Alaric Tudor. Among the very juniors of the office\nhe was regarded as the great star of the office. There was a dash about\nhim and a quick readiness for any work that came to hand in which,\nperhaps, he was not equalled by any of his compeers. Then, too, he was\nthe special friend of Sir Gregory.\n\nBut no one had yet heard Tudor say that he intended to compete with his\nseven seniors--none yet knew whether he would put himself forward as\nan adversary to his own especial friend, Norman. That Norman would be a\ncandidate had been prominently stated. For some few days not a word was\nspoken, even between the friends themselves, as to Tudor's intention.\n\nOn the Sunday they were as usual at Hampton, and then the subject was\nmooted by no less a person than Captain Cuttwater.\n\nSo you young gentlemen up in London are all going to be examined, are\nyou?' said he; 'what is it to be about? Who's to be first lieutenant of\nthe ship, is that it?'\n\n'Oh no,' said Alaric, 'nothing half so high as that. Boatswain's mate\nwould be nearer the mark.'\n\n'And who is to be the successful man?'\n\n'Oh, Harry Norman, here. He was far the first favourite in yesterday's\nbetting.'\n\nAnd how do you stand yourself?' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'Oh! I'm only an outsider,' said Alaric. 'They put my name down just to\nswell the number, but I shall be scratched before the running begins.'\n\n'Indeed he won't,' said Harry. 'He'll run and distance us all. There is\nno one who has a chance with him. Why, he is Sir Gregory's own pet.'\n\nThere was nothing more said on the subject at Surbiton Cottage. The\nladies seemed instinctively to perceive that it was a matter which they\nhad better leave alone. Not only were the two young men to be pitted\nagainst each other, but Gertrude and Linda were as divided in their\nwishes on the subject as the two candidates could be themselves.\n\nOn the following morning, however, Norman introduced the subject. 'I\nsuppose you were only jesting yesterday,' said he, 'when you told the\ncaptain that you were not going to be a candidate?'\n\n'Indeed I can hardly say that I was in jest or in earnest,' said Alaric.\n'I simply meant to decline to discuss the subject with Uncle Bat.'\n\n'But of course you do mean to stand?' said Harry. Alaric made no answer.\n\n'Perhaps you would rather decline to discuss the matter with me also?'\nsaid Harry.\n\n'Not at all; I would much prefer discussing it openly and honestly. My\nown impression is, that I had better leave it alone.'\n\n'And why so?' said Harry.\n\n'Why so?' repeated Alaric. 'Well, there are so many reasons. In the\nfirst place, there would be seven to one against me; and I must confess\nthat if I did stand I should not like to be beaten.'\n\n'The same argument might keep us all back,' said Norman.\n\n'That's true; but one man will be more sensitive, more cowardly, if you\nwill, than another; and then I think no one should stand who does not\nbelieve himself to have a fair chance. His doing so might probably mar\nhis future prospects. How can I put myself in competition with such men\nas Uppinall and Minuses?'\n\nHarry laughed slightly, for he knew it had been asked by many how\nsuch men as Uppinall and Minusex could think of putting themselves in\ncompetition with Alaric Tudor.\n\n'That is something like mock-modesty, is it not, Alaric?'\n\n'No, by heaven, it is not! I know well what those men are made of; and\nI know, or think I know, my own abilities. I will own that I rank myself\nas a human creature much higher than I rank them. But they have that\nwhich I have not, and that which they have is that which these examiners\nwill chiefly require.'\n\n'If you have no other reason,' said Norman, 'I would strongly advise you\nto send in your name.'\n\n'Well, Harry, I have another reason; and, though last, it is by no means\nthe least. You will be a candidate, and probably the successful one. To\ntell you the truth, I have no inclination to stand against you.'\n\nNorman turned very red, and then answered somewhat gravely: 'I would\nadvise you to lay aside that objection. I fairly tell you that I\nconsider your chance better than my own.'\n\n'And suppose it be so, which I am sure it is not--but suppose it be so,\nwhat then?'\n\n'Why, you will do right to take advantage of it.'\n\n'Yes, and so gain a step and lose a friend!' said Alaric. 'No; there can\nbe no heartburn to me in your being selected, for though I am older than\nyou, you are my senior in the office. But were I to be put over your\nhead, it would in the course of nature make a division between us;\nand if it were possible that you should forgive it, it would be quite\nimpossible that Gertrude should do so. I value your friendship and that\nof the Woodwards too highly to risk it.'\n\nNorman instantly fired up with true generous energy. 'I should be\nwretched,' said he, 'if I thought that such a consideration weighed\nwith you; I would rather withdraw myself than allow such a feeling to\ninterfere with your prospects. Indeed, after what you have said, I shall\nnot send in my own name unless you also send in yours.'\n\n'I shall only be creating fuel for a feud,' said Alaric. 'To put you out\nof the question, no promotion could compensate to me for what I should\nlose at Hampton.'\n\n'Nonsense, man; you would lose nothing. Faith, I don't know whether it\nis not I that should lose, if I were successful at your expense.'\n\n'How would Gertrude receive me?' said Alaric, pushing the matter further\nthan he perhaps should have done.\n\n'We won't mind Gertrude,' said Norman, with a little shade of black upon\nhis brow. 'You are an older man than I, and therefore promotion is to\nyou of more importance than to me. You are also a poorer man. I have\nsome means besides that drawn from my office, which, if I marry, I can\nsettle on my wife; you have none such. I should consider myself to be\nworse than wicked if I allowed any consideration of such a nature to\nstand in the way of your best interests. Believe me, Alaric, that though\nI shall, as others, be anxious for success myself, I should, in failing,\nbe much consoled by knowing that you had succeeded.' And as he finished\nspeaking he grasped his friend's hand warmly in token of the truth of\nhis assertion.\n\nAlaric brushed a tear from his eye, and ended by promising to be guided\nby his friend's advice. Harry Norman, as he walked into the office,\nfelt a glow of triumph as he reflected that he had done his duty by his\nfriend with true disinterested honesty. And Alaric, he also felt a glow\nof triumph as he reflected that, come what might, there would be now\nno necessity for him to break with Norman or with the Woodwards. Norman\nmust now always remember that it was at his own instigation that he,\nAlaric, had consented to be a candidate.\n\nAs regarded the real fact of the candidature, the prize was too great\nto allow of his throwing away such a chance. Alaric's present income was\n\u00c2\u00a3200; that which he hoped to gain was \u00c2\u00a3600!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMR. FIDUS NEVERBEND\n\nImmediately on entering the office, Tudor gave it to be understood that\nhe intended to give in his name as a candidate; but he had hardly done\nso when his attention was called off from the coming examinations by\nanother circumstance, which was ultimately of great importance to him.\nOne of the Assistant-Secretaries sent for him, and told him that his\nservices having been required by Sir Gregory Hardlines for a week or so,\nhe was at once to go over to that gentleman's office; and Alaric\ncould perceive that, as Sir Gregory's name was mentioned, the\nAssistant-Secretary smiled on him with no aspect of benign solicitude.\n\nHe went over accordingly, and found that Sir Gregory, having been\ndesired to select a man for a special service in the country, had named\nhim. He was to go down to Tavistock with another gentleman from the\nWoods and Forests, for the purpose of settling some disputed point as to\nthe boundaries and privileges of certain mines situated there on Crown\nproperty.\n\n'You know nothing about mining, I presume?' said Sir Gregory.\n\n'Nothing whatever,' said Alaric.\n\n'I thought not; that was one reason why I selected you. What is wanted\nis a man of sharp intelligence and plain common sense, and one also who\ncan write English; for it will fall to your lot to draw up the report on\nthe matter. Mr. Neverbend, who is to be your colleague, cannot put two\nwords together.'\n\n'Mr. Neverbend!' said Alaric.\n\n'Yes, Fidus Neverbend, of the Woods and Forests; a very excellent public\nservant, and one in whom the fullest confidence can be placed. But\nbetween you and me, he will never set the Thames on fire.'\n\n'Does he understand mining?' asked Alaric.\n\n'He understands Government properties, and will take care that the Crown\nbe not wronged; but, Tudor, the Government will look to you to get the\ntrue common-sense view of the case. I trust--I mean that I really do\ntrust, that you will not disgrace my choice.'\n\nAlaric of course promised that he would do his best, expressed the\ndeepest gratitude to his patron, and went off to put himself into\ncommunication with Mr. Neverbend at the Woods and Forests, having\nreceived an assurance that the examination in his own office should\nnot take place till after his return from Tavistock. He was not slow to\nperceive that if he could manage to come back with all the _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ of\na successful mission, the prestige of such a journey would go far to\nassist him on his coming trial.\n\nMr. Fidus Neverbend was an absolute dragon of honesty. His integrity was\nof such an all-pervading nature, that he bristled with it as a porcupine\ndoes with its quills. He had theories and axioms as to a man's conduct,\nand the conduct especially of a man in the Queen's Civil Service, up\nto which no man but himself could live. Consequently no one but himself\nappeared to himself to be true and just in all his dealings.\n\nA quarter of an hour spent over a newspaper was in his eyes a downright\nrobbery. If he saw a man so employed, he would divide out the total of\nsalary into hourly portions, and tell him to a fraction of how much he\nwas defrauding the public. If he ate a biscuit in the middle of the day,\nhe did so with his eyes firmly fixed on some document, and he had never\nbeen known to be absent from his office after ten or before four.\n\nWhen Sir Gregory Hardlines declared that Mr. Fidus Neverbend would\nnever set the Thames on fire, he meant to express his opinion that that\ngentleman was a fool; and that those persons who were responsible for\nsending Mr. Neverbend on the mission now about to be undertaken,\nwere little better than fools themselves for so sending him. But Mr.\nNeverbend was no fool. He was not a disciple of Sir Gregory's school.\nHe had never sat in that philosopher's porch, or listened to the high\ndoctrines prevalent at the Weights and Measures. He could not write with\nall Mr. Precis' conventional correctness, or dispose of any subject at\na moment's notice as would Mr. Uppinall; but, nevertheless, he was no\nfool. Sir Gregory, like many other wise men, thought that there were\nno swans but of his own hatching, and would ask, with all the pompous\nconceit of Pharisees in another age, whether good could come out of the\nWoods and Forests?\n\nSir Gregory, however, perfectly succeeded in his object of imbuing Tudor\nwith a very indifferent opinion of his new colleague's abilities. It was\nhis object that Tudor should altogether take the upper hand in the piece\nof work which was to be done between them, and that it should be clearly\nproved how very incapable the Woods and Forests were of doing their own\nbusiness.\n\nMr. Fidus Neverbend, however, whatever others in the outer world might\nthink of him, had a high character in his own office, and did not\nunder-estimate himself. He, when he was told that a young clerk\nnamed Tudor was to accompany him, conceived that he might look on his\ncompanion rather in the light of a temporary private secretary than an\nequal partner, and imagined that new glory was added to him by his being\nso treated. The two men therefore met each other with very different\nviews.\n\nBut though Mr. Neverbend was no fool, he was not an equal either in tact\nor ability to Alaric Tudor. Alaric had his interview with him, and was\nnot slow to perceive the sort of man with whom he had to act. Of course,\non this occasion, little more than grimaces and civility passed between\nthem; but Mr. Neverbend, even in his grimaces and civility, managed to\nshow that he regarded himself as decidedly No. 1 upon the occasion.\n\n'Well, Mr. Tudor,' said he, 'I think of starting on Tuesday. Tuesday\nwill not, I suppose, be inconvenient to you?'\n\n'Sir Gregory has already told me that we are expected to be at Tavistock\non Tuesday evening.'\n\n'Ah! I don't know about that,' said Neverbend; 'that may be all very\nwell for Sir Gregory, but I rather think I shall stay the night at\nPlymouth.'\n\n'It will be the same to me,' said Tudor; 'I haven't looked at the papers\nyet, so I can hardly say what may be necessary.'\n\n'No, no; of course not. As to the papers, I don't know that there is\nmuch with which you need trouble yourself. I believe I am pretty well up\nin the case. But, Mr. Tudor, there will be a good deal of writing to do\nwhen we are there.'\n\n'We are both used to that, I fancy,' said Tudor, 'so it won't kill us.'\n\n'No, of course not. I understand that there will be a good many people\nfor me to see, a great many conflicting interests for me to reconcile;\nand probably I may find myself obliged to go down two or three of these\nmines.'\n\n'Well, that will be good fun,' said Alaric.\n\nNeverbend drew himself up. The idea of having fun at the cost of\nGovernment was painful to him; however, he spared the stranger his\nreproaches, and merely remarked that the work he surmised would be\nheavy enough both for the man who went below ground, and for the one who\nremained above.\n\nThe only point settled between them was that of their starting by\nan early train on the Tuesday named; and then Alaric returned to Sir\nGregory's office, there to read through and digest an immense bulk of\npapers all bearing on the question at issue. There had, it appeared,\nbeen lately opened between the Tamar and the Tavy a new mine, which had\nbecome exceedingly prosperous--outrageously prosperous, as shareholders\nand directors of neighbouring mines taught themselves to believe. Some\nquestion had arisen as to the limits to which the happy possessors of\nthis new tin El Dorado were entitled to go; squabbles, of course, had\nbeen the result, and miners and masters had fought and bled, each side\nin defence of its own rights. As a portion of these mines were on Crown\nproperty it became necessary that the matter should be looked to, and as\nthe local inspector was accused of having been bribed and bought, and of\nbeing, in fact, an absolute official Judas, it became necessary to send\nsome one to inspect the inspector. Hence had come Alaric's mission. The\nname of the mine in question was Wheal Mary Jane, and Alaric had read\nthe denomination half a score of times before he learnt that there was\nno real female in the case.\n\nThe Sunday before he went was of course passed at Hampton, and there he\nreceived the full glory of his special appointment. He received glory,\nand Norman in an equal degree fell into the background. Mrs. Woodward\nstuck kindly to Harry, and endeavoured, in her gentle way, to quiz the\nprojected trip to Devonshire. But the other party was too strong, and\nher raillery failed to have the intended effect. Gertrude especially\nexpressed her opinion that it was a great thing for so young a man to\nhave been selected for such employment by such a person; and Linda,\nthough she said less, could not prevent her tell-tale face from saying\nmore. Katie predicted that Alaric would certainly marry Mary Jane Wheal,\nand bring her to Surbiton Cottage, and Captain Cuttwater offered to the\nhero introductions to all the old naval officers at Devonport.\n\n'By jingo! I should like to go with you,' said the captain.\n\n'I fear the pleasure would not repay the trouble,' said Alaric,\nlaughing.\n\n'Upon my word I think I'll do it,' said the captain. 'It would be of the\ngreatest possible service to you as an officer of the Crown. It would\ngive you so much weight there. I could make you known, you know----'\n\n'I could not hear of such a thing,' said Alaric, trembling at the idea\nwhich Uncle Bat had conjured up.\n\n'There is Admiral Starbod, and Captain Focassel, and old Hardaport, and\nSir Jib Boom--why, d----n me, they would all do anything for me--craving\nthe ladies' pardon.'\n\nAlaric, in his own defence, was obliged to declare that the rules of\nthe service especially required that he should hold no friendly\ncommunication with any one during the time that he was employed on this\nspecial service. Poor Captain Cuttwater, grieved to have his good nature\nchecked, was obliged to put up with this excuse, and consoled himself\nwith abusing the Government which could condescend to give so absurd an\norder.\n\nThis was on the Saturday. On the Sunday, going to church, the captain\nsuggested that Alaric might, at any rate, just call upon Sir Jib on the\nsly. 'It would be a great thing for you,' said Uncle Bat. 'I'll write\na note to-night, and you can take it with you. Sir Jib is a rising man,\nand you'll regret it for ever if you miss the opportunity.' Now Sir Jib\nBoom was between seventy and eighty, and he and Captain Cuttwater had\nmet each other nearly every day for the last twenty years, and had never\nmet without a squabble.\n\nAfter church they had their usual walk, and Linda's heart palpitated as\nshe thought that she might have to undergo another _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with\nher lover. But it palpitated in vain. It so turned out that Alaric\neither avoided, or, at any rate, did not use the privilege, and Linda\nreturned home with an undefined feeling of gentle disappointment. She\nhad fully made up her mind to be very staid, very discreet, and very\ncollected; to take a leaf out of her sister's book, and give him no\nencouragement whatever; she would not absolutely swear to him that she\ndid not now, and never could, return his passion; but she would point\nout how very imprudent any engagement between two young persons,\nsituated as they were, must be--how foolish it would be for them to\nbind themselves, for any number of years, to a marriage which must be\npostponed; she would tell Alaric all this, and make him understand that\nhe was not to regard himself as affianced to her; but she with a woman's\nfaith would nevertheless remain true to him. This was Linda's great\nresolve, and the strong hope, that in a very few weeks, Alaric would be\npromoted to a marrying income of \u00c2\u00a3600 per annum, made the prospect of\nthe task not so painful as it might otherwise have been. Fate, however,\nrobbed her of the pleasure, if it would have been a pleasure, of\nsacrificing her love to her duty; and 'dear Linda, dearest Linda,' was\nnot again whispered into her ear.\n\n'And what on earth is it that you are to do down in the mines?' asked\nMrs. Woodward as they sat together in the evening.\n\n'Nothing on the earth, Mrs. Woodward--it is to be all below the surface,\nforty fathom deep,' said Alaric.\n\n'Take care that you ever come up again,' said she.\n\n'They say the mine is exceedingly rich--perhaps I may be tempted to stay\ndown there.'\n\n'Then you'll be like the gloomy gnome, that lives in dark, cold mines,'\nsaid Katie.\n\n'Isn't it very dangerous, going down into those places?' asked Linda.\n\n'Men go down and come up again every day of their lives, and what other\nmen can do, I can, I suppose.'\n\n'That doesn't follow at all,' said Captain Cuttwater, 'What sort of a\nfigure would you make on a yard-arm, reefing a sail in a gale of wind?'\n\n'Pray do take care of yourself,' said Gertrude.\n\nNorman's brow grew black. 'I thought that it was settled that Mr.\nNeverbend was to go down, and that you were to stay above ground,' said\nhe.\n\n'So Mr. Neverbend settled it; but that arrangement may, perhaps, be\nunsettled again,' said Alaric, with a certain feeling of confidence in\nhis own strong will.\n\n'I don't at all doubt,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'that if we were to get a\nsly peep at you, we should find you both sitting comfortably at your inn\nall the time, and that neither of you will go a foot below the ground.'\n\n'Very likely. All I mean to say is, that if Neverbend goes down I'll go\ntoo.'\n\n'But mind, you gloomy gnome, mind you bring up a bit of gold for me,'\nsaid Katie.\n\nOn the Monday morning he started with the often-expressed good wishes of\nall the party, and with a note for Sir Jib Boom, which the captain made\nhim promise that he would deliver, and which Alaric fully determined to\nlose long before he got to Plymouth.\n\nThat evening he and Norman passed together. As soon as their office\nhours were over, they went into the London Exhibition, which was then\nopen; and there, walking up and down the long centre aisle, they talked\nwith something like mutual confidence of their future prospects. This\nwas a favourite resort with Norman, who had schooled himself to feel\nan interest in works of art. Alaric's mind was of a different cast;\nhe panted rather for the great than the beautiful; and was inclined\nto ridicule the growing taste of the day for torsos, Palissy ware, and\nAssyrian monsters.\n\nThere was then some mutual confidence between the two young men. Norman,\nwho was apt to examine himself and his own motives more strictly than\nAlaric ever did, had felt that something like suspicion as to his friend\nhad crept over him; and he had felt also that there was no ground for\nsuch suspicion. He had determined to throw it off, and to be again\ncordial with his companion. He had resolved so to do before his last\nvisit at Hampton; but it was at Hampton that the suspicion had been\nengendered, and there he found himself unable to be genial, kindly, and\ncontented. Surbiton Cottage was becoming to him anything but the abode\nof happiness that it had once been. A year ago he had been the hero of\nthe Hampton Sundays; he could not but now feel that Alaric had, as\nit were, supplanted him with his own friends. The arrival even of so\ninsignificant a person as Captain Cuttwater--and Captain Cuttwater was\nvery insignificant in Norman's mind--had done much to produce this state\nof things. He had been turned out of his bedroom at the cottage, and had\ntherefore lost those last, loving, lingering words, sometimes protracted\nto so late an hour, which had been customary after Alaric's departure\nto his inn--those last lingering words which had been so sweet because\ntheir sweetness had not been shared with his friend.\n\nHe could not be genial and happy at Surbiton Cottage; but he was by no\nmeans satisfied with himself that he should not have been so. When he\nfound that he had been surly with Alaric, he was much more angry with\nhimself than Alaric was with him. Alaric, indeed, was indifferent\nabout it. He had no wish to triumph over Harry, but he had an object to\npursue, and he was not the man to allow himself to be diverted from it\nby any one's caprice.\n\n'This trip is a great thing for you,' said Harry.\n\n'Well, I really don't know. Of course I could not decline it; but on\nthe whole I should be just as well pleased to have been spared. If I get\nthrough it well, why it will be well. But even that cannot help me at\nthis examination.'\n\n'I don't know that.'\n\n'Why--a week passed in the slush of a Cornish mine won't teach a man\nalgebra.'\n\n'It will give you _prestige_.'\n\n'Then you mean to say the examiners won't examine fairly; well, perhaps\nso. But what will be the effect on me if I fail? I know nothing of\nmines. I have a colleague with me of whom I can only learn that he\nis not weak enough to be led, or wise enough to lead; who is so\nself-opinionated that he thinks he is to do the whole work himself,\nand yet so jealous that he fears I shall take the very bread out of his\nmouth. What am I to do with such a man?'\n\n'You must manage him,' said Harry.\n\n'That is much easier said than done,' replied Alaric. 'I wish you had\nthe task instead of me.'\n\n'So do not I. Sir Gregory, when he chose you, knew what he was about.'\n\n'Upon my word, Harry, you are full of compliments to-day. I really ought\nto take my hat off.'\n\n'No, I am not; I am in no mood for compliments. I know very well what\nstuff you are made of. I know your superiority to myself. I know you\nwill be selected to go up over all our heads. I feel all this; and\nAlaric, you must not be surprised that, to a certain degree, it is\npainful to me to feel it. But, by God's help I will get over it; and if\nyou succeed it shall go hard with me, but I will teach myself to rejoice\nat it. Look at that fawn there,' said he, turning away his face to hide\nthe tear in his eye, 'did you ever see more perfect motion?'\n\nAlaric was touched; but there was more triumph than sympathy in his\nheart. It was sweet, much too sweet, to him to hear his superiority thus\nacknowledged. He was superior to the men who worked round him in his\noffice. He was made of a more plastic clay than they, and despite the\ninferiority of his education, he knew himself to be fit for higher work\nthan they could do. As the acknowledgement was made to him by the man\nwhom, of those around him, he certainly ranked second to himself, he\ncould not but feel that his heart's blood ran warm within him, he could\nnot but tread with an elastic step.\n\nBut it behoved him to answer Harry, and to answer him in other spirit\nthan this.\n\n'Oh, Harry,' said he, 'you have some plot to ruin me by my own conceit;\nto make me blow myself out and destroy myself, poor frog that I am, in\ntrying to loom as largely as that great cow, Fidus Neverbend. You know I\nam fully conscious how much inferior my education has been to yours.'\n\n'Education is nothing,' said Harry.\n\nEducation is nothing! Alaric triumphantly re-echoed the words in his\nheart--'Education is nothing--mind, mind is everything; mind and the\nwill.' So he expressed himself to his own inner self; but out loud he\nspoke much more courteously.\n\n'It is the innate modesty of your own heart, Harry, that makes you think\nso highly of me and so meanly of yourself. But the proof of what we each\ncan do is yet to be seen. Years alone can decide that. That your career\nwill be honourable and happy, of that I feel fully sure! I wish I were\nas confident of mine.'\n\n'But, Alaric,' said Norman, going on rather with the thread of his own\nthoughts, than answering or intending to answer what the other said, 'in\nfollowing up your high ambition--and I know you have a high ambition--do\nnot allow yourself to believe that the end justifies the means, because\nyou see that men around you act as though they believed so.'\n\n'Do I do so--do I seem to do so?' said Alaric, turning sharply round.\n\n'Don't be angry with me, Alaric; don't think that I want to preach; but\nsometimes I fancy, not that you do so, but that your mind is turning\nthat way; that in your eager desire for honourable success you won't\nscrutinize the steps you will have to take.'\n\n'That I would get to the top of the hill, in short, even though the\nhillside be miry. Well, I own I wish to get to the top of the hill.'\n\n'But not to defile yourself in doing so.'\n\n'When a man comes home from a successful chase, with his bag well\nstuffed with game, the women do not quarrel with him because there is\nmud on his gaiters.'\n\n'Alaric, that which is evil is evil. Lies are evil--'\n\n'And am I a liar?'\n\n'Heaven forbid that I should say so: heaven forbid that I should have to\nthink so! but it is by such doctrines as that that men become liars.'\n\n'What! by having muddy gaiters?'\n\n'By disregarding the means in looking to the end.'\n\n'And I will tell you how men become mere vegetables, by filling their\nminds with useless--needless scruples--by straining at gnats--'\n\n'Well, finish your quotation,' said Harry.\n\n'I have finished it; in speaking to you I would not for the world go\non, and seem to insinuate that you would swallow a camel. No insinuation\ncould be more base or unjust. But, nevertheless, I think you may be\ntoo over-scrupulous. What great man ever rose to greatness,' continued\nAlaric, after they had walked nearly the length of the building in\nsilence, 'who thought it necessary to pick his steps in the manner you\nhave described?'\n\n'Then I would not be great,' said Harry.\n\n'But, surely, God intends that there shall be great men on the earth?'\n\n'He certainly wishes that there should be good men,' said Harry.\n\n'And cannot a man be good and great?'\n\n'That is the problem for a man to solve. Do you try that. Good you\ncertainly can be, if you look to Him for assistance. Let that come\nfirst; and then the greatness, if that be possible.'\n\n'It is all a quibble about a word,' said Alaric. 'What is good? David\nwas a man after God's own heart, and a great man too, and yet he did\nthings which, were I to do, I should be too base to live. Look\nat Jacob--how did he achieve the tremendous rights of patriarchal\nprimogeniture? But, come, the policemen are trying to get rid of us;\nit is time for us to go,' and so they left the building, and passed the\nremainder of the evening in concord together--in concord so soon to be\ndissolved, and, ah! perhaps never to be renewed.\n\nOn the next morning Alaric and his new companion met each other at an\nearly hour at the Paddington station. Neverbend was rather fussy\nwith his dispatch-box, and a large official packet, which an office\nmessenger, dashing up in a cab, brought to him at the moment of his\ndeparture. Neverbend's enemies were wont to declare that a messenger, a\ncab, and a big packet always rushed up at the moment of his starting on\nany of his official trips. Then he had his ticket to get and his _Times_\nto buy, and he really had not leisure to do more than nod at Alaric\ntill he had folded his rug around him, tried that the cushion was soft\nenough, and completed his arrangements for the journey.\n\n'Well, Mr. Tudor,' at last he said, as soon as the train was in motion,\n'and how are you this morning--ready for work, I hope?'\n\n'Well, not exactly at this moment,' said Alaric. 'One has to get up so\nearly for these morning trains.'\n\n'Early, Mr. Tudor! my idea is that no hour should be considered either\nearly or late when the Crown requires our services.'\n\n'Just at present the Crown requires nothing else of us, I suppose, but\nthat we should go along at the rate of forty miles an hour.'\n\n'There is nothing like saving time,' said Neverbend. 'I know you have,\nas yet, had no experience in these sort of cases, so I have brought you\nthe papers which refer to a somewhat similar matter that occurred in the\nForest of Dean. I was sent down there, and that is the report which I\nthen wrote. I propose to take it for the model of that which we shall\nhave to draw up when we return from Tavistock;' and as he spoke he\nproduced a voluminous document, or treatise, in which he had contrived\nto render more obscure some matter that he had been sent to clear up, on\nthe Crown property in the Forest of Dean.\n\nNow Alaric had been told of this very report, and was aware that he\nwas going to Tavistock in order that the joint result of his and Mr.\nNeverbend's labours might be communicated to the Crown officers in\nintelligible language.\n\nThe monster report before him contained twenty-six pages of close folio\nwriting, and he felt that he really could not oblige Mr. Neverbend by\nreading it.\n\n'Forest of Dean! ah, that's coal, is it not?' said Alaric. 'Mary\nJane seems to be exclusively in the tin line. I fear there will be no\nanalogy.'\n\n'The cases are in many respects similar,' said Neverbend, 'and the\nmethod of treating them----'\n\n'Then I really cannot concur with you as to the propriety of my reading\nit. I should feel myself absolutely wrong to read a word of such a\nreport, for fear I might be prejudiced by your view of the case. It\nwould, in my mind, be positively dishonest in me to encourage any bias\nin my own feelings either on one side or the other.'\n\n'But really, Mr. Tudor----'\n\n'I need not say how much personal advantage it would be to me to have\nthe benefit of your experience, but my conscience tells me that I should\nnot do it--so I think I'll go to sleep.'\n\nMr. Neverbend did not know what to make of his companion; whether\nto admire the high tone of his official honesty, or to reprobate his\nidleness in refusing to make himself master of the report. While he was\nsettling the question in his own mind, Tudor went to sleep, and did\nnot wake till he was invited to partake of ten minutes' refreshment at\nSwindon.\n\n'I rather think,' said Mr. Neverbend, 'that I shall go on to Tavistock\nto-night.'\n\n'Oh! of course,' said Alaric. 'I never for a moment thought of stopping\nshort of it;' and, taking out a book, he showed himself disinclined for\nfurther conversation.\n\n'Of course, it's open to me to do as I please in such a matter,' said\nNeverbend, continuing his subject as soon as they reached the Bristol\nstation, 'but on the whole I rather think we had better go on to\nTavistock to-night.'\n\n'No, I will not stop at Plymouth,' he said, as he passed by Taunton; and\non reaching Exeter he declared that he had fully made up his mind on the\nsubject.\n\n'We'll get a chaise at Plymouth,' said Alaric.\n\n'I think there will be a public conveyance,' said Neverbend.\n\n'But a chaise will be the quickest,' said the one.\n\n'And much the dearest,' said the other.\n\n'That won't signify much to us,' said Alaric; 'we shan't pay the bill.'\n\n'It will signify a great deal to me,' said Neverbend, with a look of\nferocious honesty; and so they reached Plymouth.\n\nOn getting out of the railway carriage, Alaric at once hired a carriage\nwith a pair of horses; the luggage was strapped on, and Mr. Neverbend,\nbefore his time for expostulation had fairly come, found himself posting\ndown the road to Tavistock, followed at a respectful distance by two\ncoaches and an omnibus.\n\nThey were soon drinking tea together at the Bedford Hotel, and I beg to\nassure any travelling readers that they might have drunk tea in a much\nworse place. Mr. Neverbend, though he made a great struggle to protect\nhis dignity, and maintain the superiority of his higher rank, felt the\nground sinking from beneath his feet from hour to hour. He could not at\nall understand how it was, but even the servants at the hotel seemed to\npay more deference to Tudor than to him; and before the evening was\nover he absolutely found himself drinking port wine negus, because his\ncolleague had ordered it for him.\n\n'And now,' said Neverbend, who was tired with his long journey, 'I think\nI'll go to bed.'\n\n'Do,' said Alaric, who was not at all tired, 'and I'll go through this\ninfernal mass of papers. I have hardly looked at them yet. Now that I am\nin the neighbourhood I shall better understand the strange names.'\n\nSo Alaric went to work, and studied the dry subject that was before\nhim. It will luckily not be necessary for us to do so also. It will be\nsufficient for us to know that Wheal Mary Jane was at that moment\nthe richest of all the rich mines that had then been opened in that\ndistrict; that the, or its, or her shares (which is the proper way of\nspeaking of them I am shamefully ignorant) were at an enormous premium;\nthat these two Commissioners would have to see and talk to some scores\nof loud and angry men, deeply interested in their success or failure,\nand that that success or failure might probably in part depend on the\nview which these two Commissioners might take.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nTHE HON. UNDECIMUS SCOTT\n\n\nThe Hon. Undecimus Scott was the eleventh son of the Lord Gaberlunzie.\nLord Gaberlunzie was the representative of a very old and very noble\nrace, more conspicuous, however, at the present time for its age and\nnobility than for its wealth. The Hon. Undecimus, therefore, learnt,\non arriving at manhood, that he was heir only to the common lot of\nmortality, and that he had to earn his own bread. This, however, could\nnot have surprised him much, as nine of his brethren had previously\nfound themselves in the same condition.\n\nLord Gaberlunzie certainly was not one of those wealthy peers who are\nable to make two or three elder sons, and after that to establish any\nothers that may come with comfortable younger children's portions. The\nfamily was somewhat accustomed to the _res angusta domi_; but they were\nfully alive to the fact, that a noble brood, such as their own, ought\nalways to be able to achieve comfort and splendour in the world's broad\nfield, by due use of those privileges which spring from a noble name.\nCauldkail Castle, in Aberdeenshire, was the family residence; but few\nof the eleven young Scotts were ever to be found there after arriving at\nthat age at which they had been able to fly from the paternal hall.\n\nIt is a terrible task, that of having to provide for eleven sons. With\ntwo or three a man may hope, with some reasonable chance of seeing\nhis hope fulfilled, that things will go well with him, and that he may\ndescend to his grave without that worst of wretchedness, that gnawing\ngrief which comes from bad children. But who can hope that eleven sons\nwill all walk in the narrow path?\n\nHad Lord Gaberlunzie, however, been himself a patriarch, and ruled\nthe pastoral plains of Palestine, instead of the bleak mountains which\nsurround Cauldkail Castle, he could not have been more indifferent as to\nthe number of his sons. They flew away, each as his time came, with the\nearly confidence of young birds, and as seldom returned to disturb the\nfamily nest.\n\nThey were a cannie, comely, sensible brood. Their father and mother, if\nthey gave them nothing else, gave them strong bodies and sharp brains.\nThey were very like each other, though always with a difference. Red\nhair, bright as burnished gold; high, but not very high, cheek bones;\nand small, sharp, twinkling eyes, were the Gaberlunzie personal\ncharacteristics. There were three in the army, two in the navy, and one\nat a foreign embassy; one was at the diggings, another was chairman of\na railway company, and our own more particular friend, Undecimus,\nwas picking up crumbs about the world in a manner that satisfied the\npaternal mind that he was quite able to fly alone.\n\nThere is a privilege common to the sons of all noble lords, the full\nvalue of which the young Scotts learnt very early in life--that of\nmaking any woman with a tocher an honourable lady. 'Ye maun be a puir\nchiel, gin ye'll be worth less than ten thoosand pound in the market o'\nmarriage; and ten thoosand pound is a gawcey grand heritage!' Such had\nbeen the fatherly precept which Lord Gaberlunzie had striven to instil\ninto each of his noble sons; and it had not been thrown away upon them.\nOne after the other they had gone forth into the market-place alluded\nto, and had sold themselves with great ease and admirable discretion.\nThere had been but one Moses in the lot: the Hon. Gordon Hamilton Scott\nhad certainly brought home a bundle of shagreen spectacle cases in the\nguise of a widow with an exceedingly doubtful jointure; doubtful indeed\nat first, but very soon found to admit of no doubt whatever. He was the\none who, with true Scotch enterprise, was prosecuting his fortunes at\nthe Bendigo diggings, while his wife consoled herself at home with her\ntitle.\n\nUndecimus, with filial piety, had taken his father exactly at his word,\nand swapped himself for \u00c2\u00a310,000. He had, however, found himself imbued\nwith much too high an ambition to rest content with the income arising\nfrom his matrimonial speculation. He had first contrived to turn his\nreal \u00c2\u00a310,000 into a fabulous \u00c2\u00a350,000, and had got himself returned to\nParliament for the Tillietudlem district burghs on the credit of his\ngreat wealth; he then set himself studiously to work to make a second\nmarket by placing his vote at the disposal of the Government.\n\nNor had he failed of success in his attempt, though he had hitherto been\nable to acquire no high or permanent post. He had soon been appointed\nprivate secretary to the First Lord of the Stannaries, and he found that\nhis duty in this capacity required him to assist the Government whip in\nmaking and keeping houses. This occupation was congenial to his spirit,\nand he worked hard and well at it; but the greatest of men are open to\nthe tainting breath of suspicion, and the Honourable Undecimus Scott, or\nUndy Scott, as he was generally now called, did not escape. Ill-natured\npersons whispered that he was not on all occasions true to his party;\nand once when his master, the whip-in-chief, overborne with too much\nwork, had been tempted to put himself to bed comfortably in his own\nhouse, instead of on his usual uneasy couch behind the Speaker's chair,\nUndy had greatly failed. The leader of a party whose struggles for the\nreligion of his country had hitherto met but small success, saw at a\nglance the opportunity which fortune had placed in his way; he spied\nwith eagle eye the nakedness of that land of promise which is compressed\nin the district round the Treasury benches; the barren field before him\nwas all his own, and he put and carried his motion for closing the parks\non Sundays.\n\nHe became a hero; but Undy was all but undone. The highest hope of the\nSabbatarian had been to address an almost empty house for an hour and\na half on this his favourite subject. But the chance was too good to\nbe lost; he sacrificed his oratorical longings on the altar of party\npurpose, and limited his speech to a mere statement of his motion. Off\nflew on the wings of Hansom a youthful member, more trusty than the\ntrusted Undy, to the abode of the now couchant Treasury Argus. Morpheus\nhad claimed him all for his own. He was lying in true enjoyment, with\nhis tired limbs stretched between the unaccustomed sheets, and snoring\nwith free and sonorous nose, restrained by the contiguity of no\nSpeaker's elbow. But even in his deepest slumber the quick wheels of\nthe bounding cab struck upon the tympanum of his anxious ear. He roused\nhimself as does a noble watch-dog when the 'suspicious tread of theft'\napproaches. The hurry of the jaded horse, the sudden stop, the maddened\nfurious knock, all told a tale which his well-trained ear only knew too\nwell. He sat up for a moment, listening in his bed, stretched himself\nwith one involuntary yawn, and then stood upright on the floor. It\nshould not at any rate be boasted by any one that he had been found in\nbed.\n\nWith elastic step, three stairs at a time, up rushed that young and\neager member. It was well for the nerves of Mrs. Whip Vigil that the\ncalls of society still held her bound in some distant brilliant throng;\nfor no consideration would have stopped the patriotic energy of that\nsucking statesman. Mr. Vigil had already performed the most important\nact of a speedy toilet, when his door was opened, and as his young\nfriend appeared was already buttoning his first brace.\n\n'Pumpkin is up!' said the eager juvenile,' and we have only five men in\nthe house.'\n\n'And where the devil is Undy Scott?' said the Right Hon. Mr. Vigil.\n\n'The devil only knows,' said the other.\n\n'I deserve it for trusting him,' said the conscience-stricken but worthy\npublic servant. By this time he had on his neckcloth and boots; in his\neager haste to serve his country he had forgotten his stockings. 'I\ndeserve it for trusting him--and how many men have they?'\n\n'Forty-one when I left.'\n\n'Then they'll divide, of course?'\n\n'Of course they will,' said the promising young dove of the Treasury.\n\nAnd now Mr. Whip Vigil had buttoned on that well-made frock with which\nthe Parliamentary world is so conversant, and as he descended the\nstairs, arranged with pocket-comb his now grizzling locks. His\nwell-brushed hat stood ready to his touch below, and when he entered the\ncab he was apparently as well dressed a gentleman as when about three\nhours after noon he may be seen with slow and easy step entering the\nhalls of the Treasury chambers.\n\nBut ah! alas, he was all too late. He came but to see the ruin which\nUndy's defection had brought about. He might have taken his rest, and\nhad a quiet mind till the next morning's _Times_ revealed to him the\nfact of Mr. Pumpkin's grand success. When he arrived, the numbers\nwere being taken, and he, even he, Mr. Whip Vigil, he the great\narch-numberer, was excluded from the number of the counted. When the\ndoors were again open the Commons of England had decided by a majority\nof forty-one to seven that the parks of London should, one and all,\nbe closed on Sundays; and Mr. Pumpkin had achieved among his own set a\nweek's immortality.\n\n'We mustn't have this again, Vigil,' said a very great man the next\nmorning, with a good-humoured smile on his face, however, as he uttered\nthe reprimand. 'It will take us a whole night, and God knows how much\ntalking, to undo what those fools did yesterday.'\n\nMr. Vigil resolved to leave nothing again to the unassisted industry or\nhonesty of Undy Scott, and consequently that gentleman's claims on\nhis party did not stand so highly as they might have done but for this\naccident. Parliament was soon afterwards dissolved, and either through\nthe lukewarm support of his Government friends, or else in consequence\nof his great fortune having been found to be ambiguous, the independent\nelectors of the Tillietudlem burghs took it into their heads to unseat\nMr. Scott. Unseated for Tillietudlem, he had no means of putting himself\nforward elsewhere, and he had to repent, in the sackcloth and ashes of\nprivate life, the fault which had cost him the friendship of Mr. Vigil.\n\nHis life, however, was not strictly private. He had used the Honourable\nbefore his name, and the M.P. which for a time had followed after it,\nto acquire for himself a seat as director at a bank board. He was a\nVice-President of the Caledonian, English, Irish, and General European\nand American Fire and Life Assurance Society; such, at least, had been\nthe name of the joint-stock company in question when he joined it; but\nhe had obtained much credit by adding the word 'Oriental,' and inserting\nit after the allusion to Europe; he had tried hard to include the fourth\nquarter of the globe; but, as he explained to some of his friends, it\nwould have made the name too cumbrous for the advertisements. He was a\ndirector also of one or two minor railways, dabbled in mining\nshares, and, altogether, did a good deal of business in the private\nstock-jobbing line.\n\nIn spite of his former delinquencies, his political friends did not\naltogether throw him over. In the first place, the time might come when\nhe would be again useful, and then he had managed to acquire that air\nand tact which make one official man agreeable to another. He was always\ngood-humoured; when in earnest, there was a dash of drollery about him;\nin his most comic moods he ever had some serious purpose in view; he\nthoroughly understood the esoteric and exoteric bearings of modern\npolitics, and knew well that though he should be a model of purity\nbefore the public, it did not behove him to be very strait-laced with\nhis own party. He took everything in good part, was not over-talkative,\nover-pushing, or presumptuous; he felt no strong bias of his own; had at\nhis fingers' ends the cant phraseology of ministerial subordinates, and\nknew how to make himself useful. He knew also--a knowledge much more\ndifficult to acquire--how to live among men so as never to make himself\ndisagreeable.\n\nBut then he could not be trusted! True. But how many men in his walk of\nlife can be trusted? And those who can--at how terribly high a price\ndo they rate their own fidelity! How often must a minister be forced\nto confess to himself that he cannot afford to employ good faith! Undy\nScott, therefore, from time to time, received some ministerial bone,\nsome Civil Service scrap of victuals thrown to him from the Government\ntable, which, if it did not suffice to maintain him in all the comforts\nof a Treasury career, still preserved for him a connexion with the\nElysium of public life; gave him, as it were, a link by which he could\nhang on round the outer corners of the State's temple, and there watch\nwith advantage till the doors of Paradise should be re-opened to him. He\nwas no Lucifer, who, having wilfully rebelled against the high majesty\nof Heaven, was doomed to suffer for ever in unavailing, but still proud\nmisery, the penalties of his asserted independence; but a poor Peri, who\nhad made a lapse and thus forfeited, for a while, celestial joys, and\nwas now seeking for some welcome offering, striving to perform some\nuseful service, by which he might regain his lost glory.\n\nThe last of the good things thus tendered to him was not yet all\nconsumed. When Mr. Hardlines, now Sir Gregory, was summoned to assist\nat, or rather preside over, the deliberations of the committee which was\nto organize a system of examination for the Civil Service, the Hon. U.\nScott had been appointed secretary to that committee. This, to be sure,\nafforded but a fleeting moment of halcyon bliss; but a man like Mr.\nScott knew how to prolong such a moment to its uttermost stretch. The\ncommittee had ceased to sit, and the fruits of their labour were already\napparent in the establishment of a new public office, presided over by\nSir Gregory; but still the clever Undy continued to draw his salary.\n\nUndy was one of those men who, though married and the fathers of\nfamilies, are always seen and known '_en gar\u00c3\u00a7on_'. No one had a larger\ncircle of acquaintance than Undy Scott; no one, apparently, a smaller\ncircle than Mrs. Undy Scott. So small, indeed, was it, that its _locale_\nwas utterly unknown in the fashionable world. At the time of which we\nare now speaking Undy was the happy possessor of a bedroom in Waterloo\nPlace, and rejoiced in all the comforts of a first-rate club. But\nthe sacred spot, in which at few and happy intervals he received the\ncaresses of the wife of his bosom and the children of his loins, is\nunknown to the author.\n\nIn age, Mr. Scott, at the time of the Tavistock mining inquiry, was\nabout thirty-five. Having sat in Parliament for five years, he had\nnow been out for four, and was anxiously looking for the day when the\nuniversal scramble of a general election might give him another chance.\nIn person he was, as we have said, stalwart and comely, hirsute with\ncopious red locks, not only over his head, but under his chin and round\nhis mouth. He was well made, six feet high, neither fat nor thin, and he\nlooked like a gentleman. He was careful in his dress, but not so as to\nbetray the care that he took; he was imperturbable in temper, though\nrestless in spirit; and the one strong passion of his life was the\ndesire of a good income at the cost of the public.\n\nHe had an easy way of getting intimate with young men when it suited\nhim, and as easy a way of dropping them afterwards when that suited him.\nHe had no idea of wasting his time or opportunities in friendships. Not\nthat he was indifferent as to his companions, or did not appreciate the\npleasure of living with pleasant men; but that life was too short, and\nwith him the race too much up hill, to allow of his indulging in such\nluxuries. He looked on friendship as one of those costly delights with\nwhich none but the rich should presume to gratify themselves. He could\nnot afford to associate with his fellow-men on any other terms than\nthose of making capital of them. It was not for him to walk and talk and\neat and drink with a man because he liked him. How could the eleventh\nson of a needy Scotch peer, who had to maintain his rank and position by\nthe force of his own wit, how could such a one live, if he did not turn\nto some profit even the convivialities of existence?\n\nActing in accordance with his fixed and conscientious rule in this\nrespect, Undy Scott had struck up an acquaintance with Alaric Tudor. He\nsaw that Alaric was no ordinary clerk, that Sir Gregory was likely to\nhave the Civil Service under his thumb, and that Alaric was a great\nfavourite with the great man. It would but little have availed Undy\nto have striven to be intimate with Sir Gregory himself. The Knight\nCommander of the Bath would have been deaf to his blandishments; but it\nseemed probable that the ears of Alaric might be tickled.\n\nAnd thus Alaric and Undy Scott had become fast friends; that is, as\nfast as such friends generally are. Alaric was no more blind to his own\ninterest than was his new ally. But there was this difference between\nthem; Undy lived altogether in the utilitarian world which he had formed\naround himself, whereas Alaric lived in two worlds. When with Undy his\npursuits and motives were much such as those of Undy himself; but at\nSurbiton Cottage, and with Harry Norman, he was still susceptible of a\nhigher feeling. He had been very cool to poor Linda on his last visit\nto Hampton; but it was not that his heart was too hard for love. He had\nbegun to discern that Gertrude would never attach herself to Norman; and\nif Gertrude were free, why should she not be his?\n\nPoor Linda!\n\nScott had early heard--and of what official event did he not obtain\nearly intelligence?--that Neverbend was to go down to Tavistock about\nthe Mary Jane tin mine, and that a smart colleague was required for him.\nHe would fain, for reasons of his own, have been that smart colleague\nhimself; but that he knew was impossible. He and Neverbend were\nthe Alpha and Omega of official virtues and vices. But he took\nan opportunity of mentioning before Sir Gregory, in a passing\nunpremeditated way, how excellently adapted Tudor was for the work. It\nso turned out that his effort was successful, and that Tudor was sent.\n\nThe whole of their first day at Tavistock was passed by Neverbend\nand Alaric in hearing interminable statements from the various mining\ncombatants, and when at seven o'clock Alaric shut up for the evening\nhe was heartily sick of the job. The next morning before breakfast he\nsauntered out to air himself in front of the hotel, and who should come\nwhistling up the street, with a cigar in his mouth, but his new friend\nUndy Scott.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMR. MANYLODES\n\n\nAlaric Tudor was very much surprised. Had he seen Sir Gregory himself,\nor Captain Cuttwater, walking up the street of Tavistock, he could not\nhave been more startled. It first occurred to him that Scott must have\nbeen sent down as a third Commissioner to assist at the investigation;\nand he would have been right glad to have known that this was the case,\nfor he found that the management of Mr. Neverbend was no pastime. But he\nsoon learnt that such relief was not at hand for him.\n\n'Well, Tudor, my boy,' said he, 'and how do you like the clotted cream\nand the thick ankles of the stout Devonshire lasses?'\n\n'I have neither tasted the one, nor seen the other,' said Alaric. 'As\nyet I have encountered nothing but the not very civil tongues, and not\nvery clear brains of Cornish roughs.'\n\n'A Boeotian crew! but, nevertheless, they know on which side their bread\nis buttered--and in general it goes hard with them but they butter it on\nboth sides. And how does the faithful Neverbend conduct himself? Talk of\nBoeotians, if any man ever was born in a foggy air, it must have been my\nfriend Fidus.'\n\nAlaric merely shrugged his shoulders, and laughed slightly. 'But what on\nearth brings you down to Tavistock?' said he.\n\n'Oh! I am a denizen of the place, naturalized, and all but settled; have\nvast interests here, and a future constituency. Let the Russells look\nwell to themselves. The time is quickly coming when you will address\nme in the House with bitter sarcasm as the honourable but inconsistent\nmember for Tavistock; egad, who knows but you may have to say Right\nHonourable?'\n\n'Oh! I did not know the wind blew in that quarter,' said Alaric, not\nill-pleased at the suggestion that he also, on some future day, might\nhave a seat among the faithful Commons.\n\n'The wind blows from all quarters with me,' said Undy; 'but in the\nmeantime I am looking out for shares.'\n\n'Will you come in and breakfast?' asked the other.\n\n'What, with friend Fidus? no, thank'ee; I am not, by many degrees,\nhonest enough to suit his book. He would be down on some little public\npeccadillo of mine before I had swallowed my first egg. Besides, I would\nnot for worlds break the pleasure of your _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_.'\n\n'Will you come down after dinner?'\n\n'No; neither after dinner, nor before breakfast; not all the coffee, nor\nall the claret of the Bedford shall tempt me. Remember, my friend, you\nare paid for it; I am not.'\n\n'Well, then, good morning,' said Alaric. 'I must go in and face my fate,\nlike a Briton.'\n\nUndy went on for a few steps, and then returned, as though a sudden\nthought had struck him. 'But, Tudor, I have bowels of compassion within\nme, though no pluck. I am willing to rescue you from your misery, though\nI will not partake it. Come up to me this evening, and I will give you\na glass of brandy-punch. Your true miners never drink less generous\ntipple.'\n\n'How on earth am I to shake off this incubus of the Woods and Works?'\n\n'Shake him off? Why, make him drunk and put him to bed; or tell him at\nonce that the natural iniquity of your disposition makes it necessary\nthat you should spend a few hours of the day in the company of a sinner\nlike myself. Tell him that his virtue is too heavy for the digestive\norgans of your unpractised stomach. Tell him what you will, but come. I\nmyself am getting sick of those mining Vandals, though I am so used to\ndealing with them.'\n\nAlaric promised that he would come, and then went in to breakfast. Undy\nalso returned to his breakfast, well pleased with this first success in\nthe little scheme which at present occupied his mind. The innocent young\nCommissioner little dreamt that the Honourable Mr. Scott had come all\nthe way to Tavistock on purpose to ask him to drink brandy-punch at the\nBlue Dragon!\n\nAnother day went wearily and slowly on with Alaric and Mr. Neverbend.\nTedious, never-ending statements had to be taken down in writing;\nthe same things were repeated over and over again, and were as often\ncontradicted; men who might have said in five words all that they had to\nsay, would not be constrained to say it in less than five thousand, and\neach one seemed to think, or pretended to seem to think, that all the\nouter world and the Government were leagued together to defraud the\ninterest to which he himself was specially attached. But this was not\nthe worst of it. There were points which were as clear as daylight; but\nTudor could not declare them to be so, as by doing so he was sure to\nelicit a different opinion from Mr. Neverbend.\n\n'I am not quite so clear on that point, Mr. Tudor,' he would say.\n\nAlaric, till experience made him wise, would attempt to argue it.\n\n'That is all very well, but I am not quite so sure of it. We will\nreserve the point, if you please,' and so affairs went on darkly, no ray\nof light being permitted to shine in on the matter in dispute.\n\nIt was settled, however, before dinner, that they should both go down\nthe Wheal Mary Jane on the following day. Neverbend had done what he\ncould to keep this crowning honour of the inquiry altogether in his own\nhands, but he had found that in this respect Tudor was much too much for\nhim.\n\nImmediately after dinner Alaric announced that he was going to spend the\nevening with a friend.\n\n'A friend!' said Neverbend, somewhat startled; 'I did not know that you\nhad any friends in Tavistock.'\n\n'Not a great many; but it so happened that I did meet a man I know, this\nmorning, and promised to go to him in the evening. I hope you'll excuse\nmy leaving you?'\n\n'Oh! I don't mind for myself,' said Neverbend, 'though, when men are\ntogether, it's as well for them to keep together. But, Mr. Tudor----'\n\n'Well?' said Alaric, who felt growing within him a determination to put\ndown at once anything like interference with his private hours.\n\n'Perhaps I ought not to mention it,' said Neverbend, 'but I do hope\nyou'll not get among mining people. Only think what our position here\nis.'\n\n'What on earth do you mean?' said Alaric. 'Do you think I shall be\nbribed over by either side because I choose to drink a glass of wine\nwith a friend at another hotel?'\n\n'Bribed! No, I don't think you'll be bribed; but I think we should both\nkeep ourselves absolutely free from all chance of being talked to on\nthe subject, except before each other and before witnesses. I would\nnot drink brandy-and-water at the Blue Dragon, before this report be\nwritten, even if my brother were there.'\n\n'Well, Mr. Neverbend, I am not so much afraid of myself. But wherever\nthere are two men, there will be two opinions. So good night, if it so\nchance that you are in bed before my return.'\n\nSo Tudor went out, and Neverbend prepared himself to sit up for him. He\nwould sooner have remained up all night than have gone to bed before his\ncolleague came back.\n\nThree days Alaric Tudor had now passed with Mr. Neverbend, and not only\nthree days but three evenings also! A man may endure to be bored in the\ncourse of business through the day, but it becomes dreadful when the\ninfliction is extended to post-prandial hours. It does not often occur\nthat one is doomed to bear the same bore both by day and night; any\nchange gives some ease; but poor Alaric for three days had had no\nchange. He felt like a liberated convict as he stepped freely forth\ninto the sweet evening air, and made his way through the town to the\nopposition inn.\n\nHere he found Undy on the door-steps with a cigar in his mouth. 'Here\nI am, waiting for you,' said he. 'You are fagged to death, I know, and\nwe'll get a mouthful of fresh air before we go upstairs,'--and so saying\nhe put his arm through Alaric's, and they strolled off through the\nsuburbs of the town.\n\n'You don't smoke,' said Undy, with his cigar-case in his hand. 'Well--I\nbelieve you are right--cigars cost a great deal of money, and can't well\ndo a man any real good. God Almighty could never have intended us to\nmake chimneys of our mouths and noses. Does Fidus ever indulge in a\nweed?'\n\n'He never indulges in anything,' said Alaric.\n\n'Except honesty,' said the other, 'and in that he is a beastly glutton.\nHe gorges himself with it till all his faculties are overpowered and his\nmind becomes torpid. It's twice worse than drinking. I wonder whether\nhe'll do a bit of speculation before he goes back to town.'\n\n'Who, Neverbend?--he never speculates!'\n\n'Why not? Ah, my fine fellow, you don't know the world yet. Those sort\nof men, dull drones like Neverbend, are just the fellows who go the\ndeepest. I'll be bound he will not return without a few Mary Janes in\nhis pocket-book. He'll be a fool if he does, I know.'\n\n'Why, that's the very mine we are down here about.'\n\n'And that's the very reason why he'll purchase Mary Janes. He has an\nopportunity of knowing their value. Oh, let Neverbend alone. He is not\nso young as you are, my dear fellow.'\n\n'Young or old, I think you mistake his character.'\n\n'Why, Tudor, what would you think now if he not only bought for himself,\nbut was commissioned to buy by the very men who sent him down here?'\n\n'It would be hard to make me believe it.'\n\n'Ah! faith is a beautiful thing; what a pity that it never survives the\nthirtieth year;--except with women and fools.'\n\n'And have you no faith, Scott?'\n\n'Yes--much in myself--some little in Lord Palmerston, that is, in his\nluck; and a good deal in a bank-note. But I have none at all in Fidus\nNeverbend. What! have faith in a man merely because he tells me to have\nit! His method of obtaining it is far too easy.'\n\n'I trust neither his wit nor his judgement; but I don't believe him to\nbe a thief.'\n\n'Thief! I said nothing of thieves. He may, for aught I know, be just as\ngood as the rest of the world; all I say is, that I believe him to be no\nbetter. But come, we must go back to the inn; there is an ally of\nmine coming to me; a perfect specimen of a sharp Cornish mining\nstock-jobber--as vulgar a fellow as you ever met, and as shrewd. He won't\nstay very long, so you need not be afraid of him.'\n\nAlaric began to feel uneasy, and to think that there might by\npossibility be something in what Neverbend had said to him. He did not\nlike the idea of meeting a Cornish stock-jobber in a familiar way\nover his brandy-punch, while engaged, as he now was, on the part of\nGovernment; he felt that there might be impropriety in it, and he would\nhave been glad to get off if he could. But he felt ashamed to break his\nengagement, and thus followed Undy into the hotel.\n\n'Has Mr. Manylodes been here?' said Scott, as he walked upstairs.\n\n'He's in the bar now, sir,' said the waiter.\n\n'Beg him to come up, then. In the bar! why, that man must have a bar\nwithin himself--the alcohol he consumes every day would be a tidy sale\nfor a small public-house.'\n\nUp they went, and Mr. Manylodes was not long in following them. He was\na small man, more like an American in appearance than an Englishman.\nHe had on a common black hat, a black coat, black waistcoat, and black\ntrousers, thick boots, a coloured shirt, and very dirty hands. Though\nevery article he wore was good, and most of them such as gentlemen wear,\nno man alive could have mistaken him for a gentleman. No man, conversant\nwith the species to which he belonged, could have taken him for anything\nbut what he was. As he entered the room, a faint, sickly, second-hand\nsmell of alcohol pervaded the atmosphere.\n\n'Well, Manylodes,' said Scott, 'I'm glad to see you again. This is my\nfriend, Mr. Tudor.'\n\n'Your servant, sir,' said Manylodes, just touching his hat, without\nmoving it from his head. 'And how are you, Mr. Scott? I am glad to see\nyou again in these parts, sir.'\n\n'And how's trade? Come, Tudor, what will you drink? Manylodes, I know,\ntakes brandy; their sherry is vile, and their claret worse; maybe they\nmay have a fairish glass of port. And how is trade, Manylodes?'\n\n'We're all as brisk as bees at present. I never knew things sharper. If\nyou've brought a little money with you, now's your time. But I tell you\nthis, you'll find it sharp work for the eyesight.'\n\n'Quick's the word, I suppose.'\n\n'Lord love you! Quick! Why, a fellow must shave himself before he goes\nto bed if he wants to be up in time these days.'\n\n'I suppose so.'\n\n'Lord love you! why there was old Sam Weazle; never caught napping\nyet--why at Truro, last Monday, he bought up to 450 New Friendships, and\nbefore he was a-bed they weren't worth, not this bottle of brandy. Well,\nold Sam was just bit by those Cambourne lads.'\n\n'And how did that happen?'\n\n'Why, the New Friendships certainly was very good while they lasted;\njust for three months they was the thing certainly. Why, it came\nup, sir, as if there weren't no end of it, and just as clean as that\nhalf-crown--but I know'd there was an end coming.'\n\n'Water, I suppose,' said Undy, sipping his toddy.\n\n'Them clean takes, Mr. Scott, they never lasts. There was water, but\nthat weren't the worst. Old Weazle knew of that; he calculated he'd\nback the metal agin the water, and so he bought all up he could lay his\nfinger on. But the stuff was run out. Them Cambourne boys--what did they\ndo? Why, they let the water in on purpose. By Monday night old Weazle\nknew it all, and then you may say it was as good as a play.'\n\n'And how did you do in the matter?'\n\n'Oh, I sold. I did very well--bought at \u00c2\u00a37 2s. 3d. and sold at \u00c2\u00a36 19s.\n10 1\/2d., and got my seven per cent, for the four months. But, Lord love\nyou, them clean takes never lasts. I worn't going to hang on. Here's\nyour health, Mr. Scott. Yours, Mr.---, I didn't just catch the\ngen'leman's name;' and without waiting for further information on the\npoint, he finished his brandy-and-water.\n\n'So it's all up with the New Friendships, is it?' said Undy.\n\n'Up and down, Mr. Scott; every dog has his day; these Mary Janes will be\ngoing the same way some of them days. We're all mortal;' and with\nthis moral comparison between the uncertainty of human life and the\nvicissitudes of the shares in which he trafficked, Mr. Manylodes\nproceeded to put some more sugar and brandy into his tumbler.\n\n'True, true--we are all mortal--Manylodes and Mary Janes; old\nfriendships and New Friendships: while they last we must make the most\nwe can of them; buy them cheap and sell them dear; and above all things\nget a good percentage.'\n\n'That's the game, Mr. Scott; and I will say no man understands it better\nthan yourself--keep the ball a-running--that's your maxim. Are you going\nit deep in Mary Jane, Mr. Scott?'\n\n'Who? I! O no--she's a cut above me now, I fear. The shares are worth\nany money now, I suppose.'\n\n'Worth any money! I think they are, Mr. Scott, but I believe----' and\nthen bringing his chair close up to that of his aristocratic friend,\nresting his hands, one on Mr. Scott's knee, and the other on his elbow,\nand breathing brandy into his ear, he whispered to him words of great\nsignificance.\n\n'I'll leave you, Scott,' said Alaric, who did not enjoy the society of\nMr. Manylodes, and to whom the nature of the conversation was, in his\npresent position, extremely irksome; 'I must be back at the Bedford\nearly.'\n\n'Early--why early? surely our honest friend can get himself to bed\nwithout your interference. Come, you don't like the brandy toddy, nor\nI either. We'll see what sort of a hand they are at making a bowl of\nbishop.'\n\n'Not for me, Scott.'\n\n'Yes, for you, man; surely you are not tied to that fellow's\napron-strings,' he said, removing himself from the close contiguity of\nMr. Manylodes, and speaking under his voice; 'take my advice; if you\nonce let that man think you fear him, you'll never get the better of\nhim.'\n\nAlaric allowed himself to be persuaded and stayed.\n\n'I have just ten words of business to say to this fellow,' continued\nScott, 'and then we will be alone.'\n\nIt was a lovely autumn evening, early in September, and Alaric sat\nhimself at an open window, looking out from the back of the hotel on to\nthe Brentor, with its singular parish church, built on its highest apex,\nwhile Undy held deep council with his friend of the mines. But from time\nto time, some word of moment found its way to Alaric's ears, and made\nhim also unconsciously fix his mind on the _irritamenta malorum_, which\nare dug from the bowels of the earth in those western regions.\n\n'Minting money, sir; it's just minting money. There's been no chance\nlike it in my days. \u00c2\u00a34 12s. 6d. paid up; and they'll be at \u00c2\u00a325 in Truro\nbefore sun sets on Saturday, Lord love you, Mr. Scott, now's your\ntime. If, as I hear, they--' and then there was a very low whisper,\nand Alaric, who could not keep his eye altogether from Mr. Manylodes'\ncountenance, saw plainly that that worthy gentleman was talking of\nhimself; and in spite of his better instincts, a desire came over him\nto know more of what they were discussing, and he could not keep from\nthinking that shares bought at \u00c2\u00a34 12s. 6d., and realizing \u00c2\u00a325, must be\nvery nice property.\n\n'Well, I'll manage it,' said Scott, still in a sort of whisper, but\naudibly enough for Alaric to hear. 'Forty, you say? I'll take them at\n\u00c2\u00a35 1s. 1d.--very well;' and he took out his pocket-book and made a\nmemorandum. 'Come, Tudor, here's the bishop. We have done our business,\nso now we'll enjoy ourselves. What, Manylodes, are you off?'\n\n'Lord love you, Mr. Scott, I've a deal to do before I get to my downy;\nand I don't like those doctored tipples. Good night, Mr. Scott. I wishes\nyou good night, sir;' and making another slight reference to his hat,\nwhich had not been removed from his head during the whole interview, Mr.\nManylodes took himself off.\n\n'There, now, is a specimen of a species of the _genus homo_, class\nEnglishman, which is, I believe, known nowhere but in Cornwall.'\n\n'Cornwall and Devonshire, I suppose,' said Alaric.\n\n'No; he is out of his true element here. If you want to see him in all\nthe glory of his native county you should go west of Truro. From Truro\nto Hayle is the land of the Manylodes. And a singular species it is.\nBut, Tudor, you'll be surprised, I suppose, if I tell you that I have\nmade a purchase for you.'\n\n'A purchase for me!'\n\n'Yes; I could not very well consult you before that fellow, and yet as\nthe chance came in my way, I did not like to lose it. Come, the bishop\nain't so bad, is it, though it is doctored tipple?' and he refilled\nAlaric's glass.\n\n'But what have you purchased for me, Scott?'\n\n'Forty shares in the Mary Jane.'\n\n'Then you may undo the bargain again, for I don't want them, and shall\nnot take them.'\n\n'You need not be a bit uneasy, my dear fellow. I've bought them at\na little over \u00c2\u00a35, and they'll be saleable to-morrow at double the\nmoney--or at any rate to-morrow week. But what's your objection to\nthem?'\n\n'In the first place, I've got no money to buy shares.'\n\n'That's just the reason why you should buy them; having no money, you\ncan't but want some; and here's your way to make it. You can have no\ndifficulty in raising \u00c2\u00a3200.'\n\n'And in the next place, I should not think of buying mining shares, and\nmore especially these, while I am engaged as I now am.'\n\n'Fal de ral, de ral, de ral! That's all very fine, Mr. Commissioner;\nonly you mistake your man; you think you are talking to Mr. Neverbend.'\n\n'Well, Scott, I shan't have them.'\n\n'Just as you please, my dear fellow; there's no compulsion. Only mark\nthis; the ball is at your foot now, but it won't remain there. 'There is\na tide in the affairs of men'--you know the rest; and you know also that\n'tide and time wait for no man.' If you are contented with your two\nor three hundred a year in the Weights and Measures, God forbid that I\nshould tempt you to higher thoughts--only in that case I have mistaken\nmy man.'\n\n'I must be contented with it, if I can get nothing better,' said Tudor,\nweakly.\n\n'Exactly; you must be contented--or rather you must put up with it--if\nyou can get nothing better. That's the meaning of contentment all the\nworld over. You argue in a circle. You must be a mere clerk if you\ncannot do better than other mere clerks. But the fact of your having\nsuch an offer as that I now make you, is proof that you can do better\nthan others; proves, in fact, that you need not be a mere clerk, unless\nyou choose to remain so.'\n\n'Buying these shares might lose me all that I have got, and could not do\nmore than put a hundred pounds or so in my pocket.'\n\n'Gammon--'\n\n'Could I go back and tell Sir Gregory openly that I had bought them?'\n\n'Why, Tudor, you are the youngest fish I ever met, sent out to swim\nalone in this wicked world of ours. Who the deuce talks openly of his\nspeculations? Will Sir Gregory tell you what shares he buys? Is not\nevery member of the House, every man in the Government, every barrister,\nparson, and doctor, that can collect a hundred pounds, are not all of\nthem at the work? And do they talk openly of the matter? Does the bishop\nput it into his charge, or the parson into his sermon?'\n\n'But they would not be ashamed to tell their friends.'\n\n'Would not they? Oh! the Rev. Mr. Pickabit, of St. Judas Without, would\nnot be ashamed to tell his bishop! But the long and the short of the\nthing is this; most men circumstanced as you are have no chance of doing\nanything good till they are forty or fifty, and then their energies are\nworn out. You have had tact enough to push yourself up early, and yet it\nseems you have not pluck enough to take the goods the gods provide you.'\n\n'The gods!--you mean the devils rather,' said Alaric, who sat listening\nand drinking, almost unconsciously, his doctored tipple.\n\n'Call them what you will for me. Fortune has generally been esteemed\na goddess, but misfortune a very devil. But, Tudor, you don't know the\nworld. Here is a chance in your way. Of course that keg of brandy who\nwent out just now understands very well who you are. He wants to be\ncivil to me, and he thinks it wise to be civil to you also. He has a\nhat full of these shares, and he tells me that, knowing my weakness, and\npresuming that you have the same, he bought a few extra this morning,\nthinking we might like them. Now, I have no hesitation in saying there\nis not a single man whom the Government could send down here, from Sir\nGregory downwards, who could refuse the chance.'\n\n'I am quite sure that Neverbend----'\n\n'Oh! for Heaven's sake don't choke me with Neverbend; the fools are\nfools, and will be so; they are used for their folly. I speak of men\nwith brains. How do you think that such men as Hardlines, Vigil, and Mr.\nEstimate have got up in the world? Would they be where they are now, had\nthey been contented with their salaries?'\n\n'They had private fortunes.'\n\n'Very private they must have been--I never heard of them. No; what\nfortunes they have they made. Two of them are in Parliament, and the\nother has a Government situation of \u00c2\u00a32,000 a year, with little or\nnothing to do. But they began life early, and never lost a chance.'\n\n'It is quite clear that that blackguard who was here just now thinks\nthat he can influence my opinion by inducing me to have an interest in\nthe matter.'\n\n'He had no such idea--nor have I. Do you think I would persuade you to\nsuch villany? Do you think I do not know you too well? Of course the\npossession of these shares can have no possible effect on your report,\nand is not expected to have any. But when men like you and me become of\nany note in the world, others, such as Manylodes, like to know that we\nare embarked in the same speculation with themselves. Why are members\nof Parliament asked to be directors, and vice-governors, and presidents,\nand guardians, of all the joint-stock societies that are now set agoing?\nNot because of their capital, for they generally have none; not for\ntheir votes, because one vote can be but of little use in any emergency.\nIt is because the names of men of note are worth money. Men of note\nunderstand this, and enjoy the fat of the land accordingly. I want to\nsee you among the number.'\n\n'Twas thus the devil pleaded for the soul of Alaric Tudor; and, alas!\nhe did not plead in vain. Let him but have a fair hearing, and he seldom\ndoes. 'Tis in this way that the truth of that awful mystery, the fall of\nman, comes home to us; that we cannot hear the devil plead, and resist\nthe charm of his eloquence. To listen is to be lost. 'Lead us not into\ntemptation, but deliver us from evil!' Let that petition come forth from\na man's heart, a true and earnest prayer, and he will be so led that he\nshall not hear the charmer, let him charm ever so wisely.\n\n'Twas but a thin veil that the Hon. Undecimus Scott threw over the\nbait with which he fished for the honesty of Alaric Tudor, and yet\nit sufficed. One would say that a young man, fortified with such\naspirations as those which glowed in Alaric's breast, should have stood\na longer siege; should have been able to look with clearer eyesight on\nthe landmarks which divide honour from dishonour, integrity from fraud,\nand truth from falsehood. But he had never prayed to be delivered from\nevil. His desire had rather been that he might be led into temptation.\n\nHe had never so prayed--yet had he daily said his prayers at fitting\nintervals. On every returning Sunday had he gone through, with all the\nfitting forms, the ordinary worship of a Christian. Nor had he done this\nas a hypocrite. With due attention and a full belief he had weekly knelt\nat God's temple, and given, if not his mind, at least his heart, to\nthe service of his church. But the inner truth of the prayer which he\nrepeated so often had not come home to him. Alas! how many of us from\nweek to week call ourselves worms and dust and miserable sinners,\ndescribe ourselves as chaff for the winds, grass for the burning,\nstubble for the plough, as dirt and filth fit only to be trodden under\nfoot, and yet in all our doings before the world cannot bring home to\nourselves the conviction that we require other guidance than our own!\n\nAlaric Tudor had sighed for permission to go forth among worldlings and\nthere fight the world's battle. Power, station, rank, wealth, all the\ngood things which men earn by tact, diligence, and fortune combined, and\nwhich were so far from him at his outset in life, became daily more dear\nto his heart. And now his honourable friend twitted him with being a\nmere clerk! No, he was not, never had been, never would be such. Had he\nnot already, in five or six short years, distanced his competitors, and\nmade himself the favourite and friend of men infinitely above him in\nstation? Was he not now here in Tavistock on a mission which proved that\nhe was no mere clerk? Was not the fact of his drinking bishop in the\nfamiliar society of a lord's son, and an ex-M.P., a proof of it?\n\nIt would be calumny on him to say that he had allowed Scott to make him\ntipsy on this occasion. He was far from being tipsy; but yet the mixture\nwhich he had been drinking had told upon his brain.\n\n'But, Undy,' said he--he had never before called his honourable friend\nby his Christian name--'but, Undy, if I take these shares, where am I to\nget the money to pay for them?\n\n'The chances are you may part with them before you leave Tavistock. If\nso, you will not have to pay for them. You will only have to pocket the\ndifference.'\n\n'Or pay the loss.'\n\n'Or pay the loss. But there's no chance of that. I'll guarantee you\nagainst that.'\n\n'But I shan't like to sell them. I shan't choose to be trafficking\nin shares. Buying a few as an investment may, perhaps, be a different\nthing.'\n\n'Oh, Alaric, Alaric, to what a pass had your conscience come, when it\ncould be so silenced!'\n\n'Well, I suppose you can raise a couple of hundred--\u00c2\u00a3205 will cover the\nwhole thing, commission and all; but, mind, I don't advise you to keep\nthem long--I shall take two months' dividends, and then sell.'\n\n'Two hundred and five pounds,' said Tudor, to whom the sum seemed\nanything but trifling; 'and when must it be paid?'\n\n'Well, I can give Manylodes a cheque for the whole, dated this day\nweek. You'll be back in town before that. We must allow him \u00c2\u00a35 for the\naccommodation. I suppose you can pay the money in at my banker's by that\nday?'\n\nAlaric had some portion of the amount himself, and he knew that Norman\nhad money by him; he felt also a half-drunken conviction that if Norman\nfailed him, Captain Cuttwater would not let him want such a sum; and so\nhe said that he could, and the bargain was completed.\n\nAs he went downstairs whistling with an affected ease, and a gaiety\nwhich, he by no means felt, Undy Scott leant back in his chair,\nand began to speculate whether his new purchase was worth the\npurchase-money. 'He's a sharp fellow; certainly, in some things, and may\ndo well yet; but he's uncommonly green. That, however, will wear off.\nI should not be surprised if he told Neverbend the whole transaction\nbefore this time to-morrow.' And then Mr. Scott finished his cigar and\nwent to bed.\n\nWhen Alaric entered the sitting-room at the Bedford, he found Neverbend\nstill seated at a table covered with official books and huge bundles of\nofficial papers. An enormous report was open before him, from which he\nwas culling the latent sweets, and extracting them with a pencil. He\nglowered at Alaric with a severe suspicious eye, which seemed to accuse\nhim at once of the deed which he had done.\n\n'You are very late,' said Neverbend, 'but I have not been sorry to be\nalone. I believe I have been able to embody in a rough draft the various\npoints which we have hitherto discussed. I have just been five hours\nand a half at it;' and Fidus looked at his watch; 'five hours and forty\nminutes. To-morrow, perhaps, that is, if you are not going to your\nfriend again, you'll not object to make a fair copy----'\n\n'Copy!' shouted Alaric, in whose brain the open air had not diminished\nthe effect of the bishop, and who remembered, with all the energy of pot\nvalour, that he was not a mere clerk; 'copy--bother; I'm going to bed,\nold fellow; and I advise you to do the same.'\n\nAnd then, taking up a candlestick and stumbling somewhat awkwardly\nagainst a chair, Tudor went off to his room, waiting no further reply\nfrom his colleague.\n\nMr. Neverbend slowly put up his papers and followed him. 'He is\ndecidedly the worse for drink--decidedly so,' said he to himself, as he\npulled off his clothes. 'What a disgrace to the Woods and Works--what a\ndisgrace!'\n\nAnd he resolved in his mind that he would be very early at the pit's\nmouth. He would not be kept from his duty while a dissipated colleague\ncollected his senses by the aid of soda-water.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nWHEAL MARY JANE\n\n\nMr. Manylodes was, at any rate, right in this, that that beverage, which\nmen call bishop, is a doctored tipple; and Alaric Tudor, when he woke in\nthe morning, owned the truth. It had been arranged that certain denizens\nof the mine should meet the two Commissioners at the pit-mouth at eight\no'clock, and it had been settled at dinner-time that breakfast should\nbe on the table at seven, sharp. Half an hour's quick driving would take\nthem to the spot.\n\nAt seven Mr. Fidus Neverbend, who had never yet been known to be untrue\nto an appointment by the fraction of a second, was standing over the\nbreakfast-table alone. He was alone, but not on that account unhappy.\nHe could hardly disguise the pleasure with which he asked the waiter\nwhether Mr. Tudor was yet dressed, or the triumph which he felt when he\nheard that his colleague was not _quite ready_.\n\n'Bring the tea and the eggs at once,' said Neverbend, very briskly.\n\n'Won't you wait for Mr. Tudor?' asked the waiter, with an air of\nsurprise. Now the landlord, waiter, boots, and chambermaid, the\nchambermaid especially, had all, in Mr. Neverbend's estimation, paid\nTudor by far too much consideration; and he was determined to show that\nhe himself was first fiddle.\n\n'Wait! no; quite out of the question--bring the hot water\nimmediately--and tell the ostler to have the fly at the door at\nhalf-past seven exact.'\n\n'Yes, sir,' said the man, and disappeared.\n\nNeverbend waited five minutes, and then rang the bell impetuously. 'If\nyou don't bring me my tea immediately, I shall send for Mr. Boteldale.'\nNow Mr. Boteldale was the landlord.\n\n'Mr. Tudor will be down in ten minutes,' was the waiter's false reply;\nfor up to that moment poor Alaric had not yet succeeded in lifting his\nthrobbing head from his pillow. The boots was now with him administering\nsoda-water and brandy, and he was pondering in his sickened mind\nwhether, by a manful effort, he could rise and dress himself; or whether\nhe would not throw himself backwards on his coveted bed, and allow\nNeverbend the triumph of descending alone to the nether world.\n\nNeverbend nearly threw the loaf at the waiter's head. Wait ten minutes\nlonger! what right had that vile Devonshire napkin-twirler to make\nto him so base a proposition? 'Bring me my breakfast, sir,' shouted\nNeverbend, in a voice that made the unfortunate sinner jump out of the\nroom, as though he had been moved by a galvanic battery.\n\nIn five minutes, tea made with lukewarm water, and eggs that were not\nhalf boiled were brought to the impatient Commissioner. As a rule Mr.\nNeverbend, when travelling on the public service, made a practice of\nenjoying his meals. It was the only solace which he allowed himself; the\nonly distraction from the cares of office which he permitted either to\nhis body or his mind. But on this great occasion his country required\nthat he should forget his comforts; and he drank his tasteless tea, and\nate his uncooked eggs, threatening the waiter as he did so with sundry\npains and penalties, in the form of sixpences withheld.\n\n'Is the fly there?' said he, as he bolted a last morsel of cold roast\nbeef.\n\n'Coming, sir,' said the waiter, as he disappeared round a corner.\n\nIn the meantime Alaric sat lackadaisical on his bedside, all undressed,\nleaning his head upon his hand, and feeling that his struggle to dress\nhimself was all but useless. The sympathetic boots stood by with a cup\nof tea--well-drawn comfortable tea--in his hand, and a small bit of dry\ntoast lay near on an adjacent plate.\n\n'Try a bit o' toast, sir,' said boots.\n\n'Ugh!' ejaculated poor Alaric.\n\n'Have a leetle drop o' rum in the tea, sir, and it'll set you all to\nrights in two minutes.'\n\nThe proposal made Alaric very sick, and nearly completed the\ncatastrophe. 'Ugh!' he said.\n\n'There's the trap, sir, for Mr. Neverbend,' said the boots, whose ears\ncaught the well-known sound.\n\n'The devil it is!' said Alaric, who was now stirred up to instant\naction. 'Take my compliments to Mr. Neverbend, and tell him I'll thank\nhim to wait ten minutes.'\n\nBoots, descending with the message, found Mr. Neverbend ready coated\nand gloved, standing at the hotel door. The fly was there, and the lame\nostler holding the horse; but the provoking driver had gone back for his\ncoat.\n\n'Please, sir, Mr. Tudor says as how you're not to go just at present,\nbut to wait ten minutes till he be ready.'\n\nNeverbend looked at the man, but he would not trust himself to\nspeak. Wait ten minutes, and it now wanted five-and-twenty minutes to\neight!--no--not for all the Tudors that ever sat upon the throne of\nEngland.\n\nThere he stood with his watch in his hand as the returning Jehu hurried\nround from the stable yard. 'You are now seven minutes late,' said he,\n'and if you are not at the place by eight o'clock, I shall not give you\none farthing!'\n\n'All right,' said Jehu. 'We'll be at Mary Jane in less than no time;'\nand off they went, not at the quickest pace. But Neverbend's heart beat\nhigh with triumph, as he reflected that he had carried the point on\nwhich he had been so intent.\n\nAlaric, when he heard the wheels roll off, shook from him his lethargy.\nIt was not only that Neverbend would boast that he alone had gone\nthrough the perils of their subterranean duty, but that doubtless\nhe would explain in London how his colleague had been deterred from\nfollowing him. It was a grievous task, that of dressing himself, as\nyouthful sinners know but too well. Every now and then a qualm would\ncome over him, and make the work seem all but impossible. Boots,\nhowever, stuck to him like a man, poured cold water over his head,\nrenewed his tea-cup, comforted him with assurances of the bracing air,\nand put a paper full of sandwiches in his pocket.\n\n'For heaven's sake put them away,' said Alaric, to whom the very idea of\nfood was repulsive.\n\n'You'll want 'em, sir, afore you are half way to Mary Jane; and it a'n't\nno joke going down and up again. I know what's what, sir.'\n\nThe boots stuck to him like a man. He did not only get him sandwiches,\nbut he procured for him also Mr. Boteldale's own fast-trotting pony,\nand just as Neverbend was rolling up to the pit's mouth fifteen minutes\nafter his time, greatly resolving in his own mind to button his breeches\npocket firmly against the recreant driver, Alaric started on the chase\nafter him.\n\nMr. Neverbend had a presentiment that, sick as his friend might\nbe, nauseous as doubtless were the qualms arising from yesterday's\nintemperance, he would make an attempt to recover his lost ground. He\nof the Woods and Works had begun to recognize the energy of him of the\nWeights and Measures, and felt that there was in it a force that would\nnot easily be overcome, even by the fumes of bishop. But yet it would be\na great thing for the Woods and Works if he, Neverbend, could descend\nin this perilous journey to the deep bowels of the earth, leaving the\nWeights and Measures stranded in the upper air. This descent among the\nhidden riches of a lower world, this visit to the provocations of evils\nnot yet dug out from their durable confinement, was the keystone, as it\nwere, of the whole mission. Let Neverbend descend alone, alone inspect\nthe wonders of that dirty deep, and Tudor might then talk and write\nas he pleased. In such case all the world of the two public offices in\nQuestion, and of some others cognate to them, would adjudge that he,\nNeverbend, had made himself master of the situation.\n\nActuated by these correct calculations, Mr. Neverbend was rather fussy\nto begin an immediate descent when he found himself on the spot. Two\nnative gentlemen, who were to accompany the Commissioners, or the\nCommissioner, as appeared likely to be the case, were already there, as\nwere also the men who were to attend upon them.\n\nIt was an ugly uninviting place to look at, with but few visible signs\nof wealth. The earth, which had been burrowed out by these human rabbits\nin their search after tin, lay around in huge ungainly heaps;\nthe overground buildings of the establishment consisted of a few\nill-arranged sheds, already apparently in a state of decadence; dirt and\nslush, and pods of water confined by muddy dams, abounded on every side;\nmuddy men, with muddy carts and muddy horses, slowly crawled hither and\nthither, apparently with no object, and evidently indifferent as to whom\nthey might overset in their course. The inferior men seemed to show no\nrespect to those above them, and the superiors to exercise no authority\nover those below them. There was, a sullen equality among them all. On\nthe ground around was no vegetation; nothing green met the eye, some few\nstunted bushes appeared here and there, nearly smothered by heaped-up\nmud, but they had about them none of the attractiveness of foliage. The\nwhole scene, though consisting of earth alone, was unearthly, and looked\nas though the devil had walked over the place with hot hoofs, and then\nraked it with a huge rake.\n\n'I am afraid I am very late,' said Neverbend, getting out of his fly in\nall the haste he could muster, and looking at his watch the moment his\nfoot touched the ground, 'very late indeed, gentlemen; I really must\napologize, but it was the driver; I was punctual to the minute, I was\nindeed. But come, gentlemen, we won't lose another moment,' and Mr.\nNeverbend stepped out as though he were ready at an instant's notice to\nplunge head foremost down the deepest shaft in all that region of mines.\n\n'Oh, sir, there a'n't no cause of hurry whatsomever,' said one of the\nmining authorities; 'the day is long enough.'\n\n'Oh, but there is cause of hurry, Mr. Undershot,' said Neverbend angrily\n'great cause of hurry; we must do this work very thoroughly; and I\npositively have not time to get through all that I have before me.\n\n'But-a'n't the other gen'leman a-coming?' asked Mr. Undershot.\n\n'Surely Mr. Tooder isn't a going to cry off?' said the other. 'Why, he\nwas so hot about it yesterday.'\n\n'Mr. Tudor is not very well this morning,' said Mr. Neverbend. 'As his\ngoing down is not necessary for the inquiry, and is merely a matter of\ntaste on his part, he has not joined me this morning. Come, gentlemen,\nare we ready?'\n\nIt was then for the first time explained to Mr. Neverbend that he had to\ngo through a rather complicated adjustment of his toilet before he would\nbe considered fit to meet the infernal gods. He must, he was informed,\nenvelop himself from head to foot in miner's habiliments, if he wished\nto save every stitch he had on him from dirt and destruction. He must\nalso cover up his head with a linen cap, so constituted as to carry a\nlump of mud with a candle stuck in it, if he wished to save either his\nhead from filth or his feet from falling. Now Mr. Neverbend, like most\nclerks in public offices, was somewhat particular about his wardrobe; it\nbehoved him, as a gentleman frequenting the West End, to dress well, and\nit also behoved him to dress cheaply; he was, moreover, careful both as\nto his head and feet; he could not, therefore, reject the recommended\nprecautions, but yet the time!--the time thus lost might destroy all.\n\nHe hurried into the shed where his toilet was to be made, and suffered\nhimself to be prepared in the usual way. He took off his own great coat,\nand put on a muddy course linen jacket that covered the upper portion\nof his body completely; he then dragged on a pair of equally muddy\noveralls; and lastly submitted to a most uninviting cap, which came down\nover his ears, and nearly over his eyes, and on the brow of which a lump\nof mud was then affixed, bearing a short tallow candle.\n\nBut though dressed thus in miner's garb, Mr. Neverbend could not be said\nto look the part he filled. He was a stout, reddish-faced gentleman,\nwith round shoulders and huge whiskers, he was nearly bald, and wore\nspectacles, and in the costume in which he now appeared he did not seem\nto be at his ease. Indeed, all his air of command, all his personal\ndignity and dictatorial tone, left him as soon as he found himself\nmetamorphosed into a fat pseudo-miner. He was like a cock whose feathers\nhad been trailed through the mud, and who could no longer crow aloud,\nor claim the dunghill as his own. His appearance was somewhat that of\na dirty dissipated cook who, having been turned out of one of the clubs\nfor drunkenness, had been wandering about the streets all night. He\nbegan to wish that he was once more in the well-known neighbourhood of\nCharing Cross.\n\nThe adventure, however, must now be carried through. There was still\nenough of manhood in his heart to make him feel that he could not return\nto his colleague at Tavistock without visiting the wonders which he had\ncome so far to see. When he reached the head of the shaft, however,\nthe affair did appear to him to be more terrible than he had before\nconceived. He was invited to get into a rough square bucket, in which\nthere was just room for himself and another to stand; he was specially\ncautioned to keep his head straight, and his hands and elbows from\nprotruding, and then the windlass began to turn, and the upper world,\nthe sunlight, and all humanity receded from his view.\n\nThe world receded from his view, but hardly soon enough; for as the\nwindlass turned and the bucket descended, his last terrestrial glance,\nlooking out among the heaps of mud, descried Alaric Tudor galloping on\nMr. Boteldale's pony up to the very mouth of the mine.\n\n'_Facilis descensus Averni_.' The bucket went down easy enough, and all\ntoo quick. The manner in which it grounded itself on the first landing\ngrated discordantly on Mr. Neverbend's finer perceptibilities. But\nwhen he learnt, after the interchange of various hoarse and to him\nunintelligible bellowings, that he was to wait in that narrow damp lobby\nfor the coming of his fellow-Commissioner, the grating on his feelings\nwas even more discordant. He had not pluck enough left to grumble: but\nhe grunted his displeasure. He grunted, however, in vain; for in about\na quarter of an hour Alaric was close to him, shoulder to shoulder. He\nalso wore a white jacket, &c., with a nightcap of mud and candle on his\nhead; but somehow he looked as though he had worn them all his life.\nThe fast gallop, and the excitement of the masquerade, which for him\nhad charms the sterner Neverbend could not feel, had dissipated his\nsickness; and he was once more all himself.\n\n'So I've caught you at the first stage,' said he, good-humouredly; for\nthough he knew how badly he had been treated, he was much too wise to\nshow his knowledge. 'It shall go hard but I'll distance you before we\nhave done,' he said to himself. Poor Neverbend only grunted.\n\nAnd then they all went down a second stage in another bucket; and then a\nthird in a third bucket; and then the business commenced. As far as this\npoint passive courage alone had been required; to stand upright in a\nwooden tub and go down, and down, and down, was in itself easy enough,\nso long as the heart did not utterly faint. Mr. Neverbend's heart had\ngrown faintish, but still he had persevered, and now stood on a third\nlobby, listening with dull, unintelligent ears to eager questions asked,\nby his colleague, and to the rapid answers of their mining guides. Tudor\nwas absolutely at work with paper and pencil, taking down notes in that\nwretched Pandemonium.\n\n'There now, sir,' said the guide; 'no more of them ugly buckets, Mr.\nNeverbend; we can trust to our own arms and legs for the rest of it,\nand so saying, he pointed out to Mr. Neverbend's horror-stricken eyes\na perpendicular iron ladder fixed firmly against the upright side of a\nshaft, and leading--for aught Mr. Neverbend could see--direct to hell\nitself.\n\n'Down here, is it?' said Alaric peeping over.\n\n'I'll go first,' said the guide; and down he went, down, down, down,\ntill Neverbend looking over, could barely see the glimmer of his\ndisappearing head light. Was it absolutely intended that he should\ndisappear in the same way? Had he bound himself to go down that fiendish\nupright ladder? And were he to go down it, what then? Would it be\npossible that a man of his weight should ever come up again?\n\n'Shall it be you or I next?' said Alaric very civilly. Neverbend could\nonly pant and grunt, and Alaric, with a courteous nod, placed himself on\nthe ladder, and went down, down, down, till of him also nothing was left\nbut the faintest glimmer. Mr. Neverbend remained above with one of the\nmining authorities; one attendant miner also remained with them.\n\n'Now, Sir,' said the authority, 'if you are ready, the ladder is quite\nfree.'\n\nFree! What would not Neverbend have given to be free also himself! He\nlooked down the free ladder, and the very look made him sink. It\nseemed to him as though nothing but a spider could creep down that\nperpendicular abyss. And then a sound, slow, sharp, and continuous, as\nof drops falling through infinite space on to deep water, came upon his\near; and he saw that the sides of the abyss were covered with slime; and\nthe damp air made him cough, and the cap had got over his spectacles and\nnearly blinded him; and he was perspiring with a cold, clammy sweat.\n\n'Well, sir, shall we be going on?' said the authority. 'Mr. Tooder'll be\nat the foot of the next set before this.'\n\nMr. Neverbend wished that Mr. Tudor's journey might still be down, and\ndown, and down, till he reached the globe's centre, in which conflicting\nattractions might keep him for ever fixed. In his despair he essayed\nto put one foot upon the ladder, and then looked piteously up to the\nguide's face. Even in that dark, dingy atmosphere the light of the\nfarthing candle on his head revealed the agony of his heart. His\ncompanions, though they were miners, were still men. They saw his\nmisery, and relented.\n\n'Maybe thee be afeared?' said the working miner, 'and if so be thee\nbee'st, thee'd better bide.'\n\n'I am sure I should never come up again,' said Neverbend, with a voice\npleading for mercy, but with all the submission of one prepared to\nsuffer without resistance if mercy should not be forthcoming.\n\n'Thee bee'st for sartan too thick and weazy like for them stairs,' said\nthe miner.\n\n'I am, I am,' said Neverbend, turning on the man a look of the warmest\naffection, and shoving the horrid, heavy, encumbered cap from off his\nspectacles; 'yes, I am too fat.' How would he have answered, with what\naspect would he have annihilated the sinner, had such a man dared to\ncall him weazy up above, on _terra firma_, under the canopy of heaven?\n\nHis troubles, however, or at any rate his dangers, were brought to an\nend. As soon as it became plainly manifest that his zeal in the public\nservice would carry him no lower, and would hardly suffice to keep\nlife throbbing in his bosom much longer, even in his present level,\npreparations were made for his ascent. A bell was rung; hoarse voices\nwere again heard speaking and answering in sounds quite unintelligible\nto a Cockney's ears; chains rattled, the windlass whirled, and the huge\nbucket came tumbling down, nearly on their heads. Poor Neverbend was\nall but lifted into it. Where now was all the pride of the morn that\nhad seen him go forth the great dictator of the mines? Where was that\ntowering spirit with which he had ordered his tea and toast, and rebuked\nthe slowness of his charioteer? Where the ambition that had soared so\nhigh over the pet of the Weights and Measures? Alas, alas! how few of\nus there are who have within us the courage to be great in adversity.\n_'Aequam memento'_--&c., &c.!--if thou couldst but have thought of it, O\nNeverbend, who need'st must some day die.\n\nBut Neverbend did not think of it. How few of us do remember such\nlessons at those moments in which they ought to be of use to us! He was\nall but lifted into the tub, and then out of it, and then again into\nanother, till he reached the upper world, a sight piteous to behold.\nHis spectacles had gone from him, his cap covered his eyes, his lamp had\nreversed itself, and soft globules of grease had fallen on his nose, he\nwas bathed in perspiration, and was nevertheless chilled through to his\nvery bones, his whiskers were fringed with mud, and his black cravat\nhad been pulled from his neck and lost in some infernal struggle.\nNevertheless, the moment in which he seated himself on a hard stool in\nthat rough shed was perhaps the happiest in his life; some Christian\nbrought him beer; had it been nectar from the brewery of the gods, he\ncould not have drunk it with greater avidity.\n\nBy slow degrees he made such toilet as circumstances allowed, and then\nhad himself driven back to Tavistock, being no more willing to wait for\nTudor now than he had been in the early morning. But Jehu found him\nmuch more reasonable on his return; and as that respectable functionary\npocketed his half-crown, he fully understood the spirit in which it was\ngiven. Poor Neverbend had not now enough pluck left in him to combat the\nhostility of a post-boy.\n\nAlaric, who of course contrived to see all that was to be seen, and\nlearn all that was to be learnt, in the dark passages of the tin\nmine, was careful on his return to use his triumph with the greatest\nmoderation. His conscience was, alas, burdened with the guilty knowledge\nof Undy's shares. When he came to think of the transaction as he rode\nleisurely back to Tavistock, he knew how wrong he had been, and yet\nhe felt a kind of triumph at the spoil which he held; for he had heard\namong the miners that the shares of Mary Jane were already going up\nto some incredible standard of value. In this manner, so said he to\nhimself, had all the great minds of the present day made their money,\nand kept themselves afloat. 'Twas thus he tried to comfort himself; but\nnot as yet successfully.\n\nThere were no more squabbles between Mr. Neverbend and Mr. Tudor; each\nknew that of himself, which made him bear and forbear; and so the two\nCommissioners returned to town on good terms with each other, and Alaric\nwrote a report, which delighted the heart of Sir Gregory Hardlines,\nruined the opponents of the great tin mine, and sent the Mary Jane\nshares up, and up, and up, till speculating men thought that they could\nnot give too high a price to secure them.\n\nAlaric returned to town on Friday. It had been arranged that he, and\nCharley, and Norman, should all go down to Hampton on the Saturday; and\nthen, on the following week, the competitive examination was to take\nplace. But Alaric's first anxiety after his return was to procure\nthe \u00c2\u00a3206, which he had to pay for the shares which he held in his\npocket-book. He all but regretted, as he journeyed up to town, with the\nnow tame Fidus seated opposite to him, that he had not disposed of them\nat Tavistock even at half their present value, so that he might have\nsaved himself the necessity of being a borrower, and have wiped his\nhands of the whole affair.\n\nHe and Norman dined together at their club in Waterloo Place, the\nPythagorean, a much humbler establishment than that patronized by Scott,\nand one that was dignified by no politics. After dinner, as they sat\nover their pint of sherry, Alaric made his request.\n\n'Harry,' said he, suddenly, 'you are always full of money--I want you to\nlend me \u00c2\u00a3150.'\n\nNorman was much less quick in his mode of speaking than his friend, and\nat the present moment was inclined to be somewhat slower than usual.\nThis affair of the examination pressed upon his spirits, and made him\ndull and unhappy. During the whole of dinner he had said little or\nnothing, and had since been sitting listlessly gazing at vacancy, and\nbalancing himself on the hind-legs of his chair.\n\n'O yes--certainly,' said he; but he said it without the eagerness with\nwhich Alaric thought that he should have answered his request.\n\n'If it's inconvenient, or if you don't like it,' said Alaric, the blood\nmounting to his forehead, 'it does not signify. I can do without it.'\n\n'I can lend it you without any inconvenience,' said Harry. 'When do you\nwant it--not to-night, I suppose?'\n\n'No--not to-night--I should like to have it early to-morrow morning; but\nI see you don't like it, so I'll manage it some other way.'\n\n'I don't know what you mean by not liking it. I have not the slightest\nobjection to lending you any money I can spare. I don't think you'll\nfind any other of your friends who will like it better. You can have it\nby eleven o'clock to-morrow.'\n\nIntimate as the two men were, there had hitherto been very little\nborrowing or lending between them; and now Alaric felt as though he owed\nit to his intimacy with his friend to explain to him why he wanted so\nlarge a sum in so short a time. He felt, moreover, that he would not\nhimself be so much ashamed of what he had done if he could confess it to\nsome one else. He could then solace himself with the reflection that he\nhad done nothing secret. Norman, he supposed, would be displeased; but\nthen Norman's displeasure could not injure him, and with Norman there\nwould be no danger that the affair would go any further.\n\n'You must think it very strange,' said he, 'that I should want such a\nsum; but the truth is I have bought some shares.'\n\n'Railway shares?' said Norman, in a tone that certainly did not signify\napproval. He disliked speculation altogether, and had an old-fashioned\nidea that men who do speculate, should have money wherewith to do it.\n\n'No--not railway shares exactly.'\n\n'Canal?' suggested Norman.\n\n'No--not canal.'\n\n'Gas?'\n\n'Mines,' said Alaric, bringing out the dread truth at last.\n\nHarry Norman's brow grew very black. 'Not that mine that you've been\ndown about, I hope,' said he.\n\n'Yes--that very identical Mary Jane that I went down, and down about,'\nsaid Alaric, trying to joke on the subject. 'Don't look so very black,\nmy dear fellow. I know all that you have to say upon the matter. I did\nwhat was very foolish, I dare say; but the idea never occurred to me\ntill it was too late, that I might be suspected of making a false report\non the subject, because I had embarked a hundred pounds in it.'\n\n'Alaric, if it were known--'\n\n'Then it mustn't be known,' said Tudor. 'I am sorry for it; but, as I\ntold you, the idea didn't occur to me till it was too late. The shares\nare bought now, and must be paid for to-morrow. I shall sell them the\nmoment I can, and you shall have the money in three or four days.'\n\n'I don't care one straw about the money,' said Norman, now quick enough,\nbut still in great displeasure; 'I would give double the amount that you\nhad not done this.'\n\n'Don't be so suspicious, Harry,' said the other--'don't try to think the\nworst of your friend. By others, by Sir Gregory Hardlines, Neverbend,\nand such men, I might expect to be judged harshly in such a matter. But\nI have a right to expect that you will believe me. I tell you that I\ndid this inadvertently, and am sorry for it; surely that ought to be\nsufficient.'\n\nNorman said nothing more; but he felt that Tudor had done that which,\nif known, would disgrace him for ever. It might, however, very probably\nnever be known; and it might also be that Tudor would never act so\ndishonestly again. On the following morning the money was paid; and\nin the course of the next week the shares were resold, and the money\nrepaid, and Alaric Tudor, for the first time in his life, found himself\nto be the possessor of over three hundred pounds.\n\nSuch was the price which Scott, Manylodes, & Co., had found it worth\ntheir while to pay him for his good report on Mary Jane.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTHE THREE KINGS\n\n\nAnd now came the all-important week. On the Saturday the three young men\nwent down to Hampton. Charley had lately been leading a very mixed sort\nof life. One week he would consort mainly with the houri of the Norfolk\nStreet beer-shop, and the next he would be on his good behaviour, and\nlive as respectably as circumstances permitted him to do. His scope\nin this respect was not large. The greatest respectability which\nhis unassisted efforts could possibly achieve was to dine at a cheap\neating-house, and spend his evenings, at a cigar divan. He belonged to\nno club, and his circle of friends, except in the houri and navvy line,\nwas very limited. Who could expect that a young man from the Internal\nNavigation would sit for hours and hours alone in a dull London lodging,\nover his book and tea-cup? Who should expect that any young man will do\nso? And yet mothers, and aunts, and anxious friends, do expect it--very\nmuch in vain.\n\nDuring Alaric's absence at Tavistock, Norman had taken Charley by the\nhand and been with him a good deal. He had therefore spent an uncommonly\nrespectable week, and the Norfolk Street houri would have been _au\nd\u00c3\u00a9sespoir_, but that she had other Charleys to her bow. When he found\nhimself getting into a first-class carriage at the Waterloo-bridge\nstation with his two comrades, he began to appreciate the comfort of\ndecency, and almost wished that he also had been brought up among the\nstern morals and hard work of the Weights and Measures.\n\nNothing special occurred at Surbiton Cottage. It might have been evident\nto a watchful bystander that Alaric was growing in favour with all the\nparty, excepting Mrs. Woodward, and that, as he did so, Harry was more\nand more cherished by her.\n\nThis was specially shown in one little scene. Alaric had brought down\nwith him to Hampton the documents necessary to enable him to draw out\nhis report on Mary Jane. Indeed, it was all but necessary that he should\ndo so, as his coming examination would leave him but little time for\nother business during the week. On Saturday night he sat up at his inn\nover the papers, and on Sunday morning, when Mrs. Woodward and the girls\ncame down, ready bonneted, for church, he signified his intention of\nremaining at his work.\n\n'I certainly think he might have gone to church,' said Mrs. Woodward,\nwhen the hall-door closed behind the party, as they started to their\nplace of worship.\n\n'Oh! mamma, think how much he has to do,' said Gertrude.\n\n'Nonsense,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'it's all affectation, and he ought to\ngo to church. Government clerks are not worked so hard as all that; are\nthey, Harry?'\n\n'Alaric is certainly very busy, but I think he should go to church all\nthe same,' said Harry, who himself never omitted divine worship.\n\n'But surely this is a work of necessity?' said Linda.\n\n'Fiddle-de-de,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'I hate affectation, my dear. It's\nvery grand, I dare say, for a young man's services to be in such request\nthat he cannot find time to say his prayers. He'll find plenty of time\nfor gossiping by and by, I don't doubt.'\n\nLinda could say nothing further, for an unbidden tear moistened her\neyelid as she heard her mother speak so harshly of her lover. Gertrude,\nhowever, took up the cudgels for him, and so did Captain Cuttwater.\n\n'I think you are a little hard upon him, mamma,' said Gertrude,\n'particularly when you know that, as a rule, he always goes to church. I\nhave heard you say yourself what an excellent churchman he is.'\n\n'Young men change sometimes,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Upon my word, Bessie, I think you are very uncharitable this fine\nSunday morning,' said the captain. 'I wonder how you'll feel if we have\nthat chapter about the beam and the mote.'\n\nMrs. Woodward did not quite like being scolded by her uncle before her\ndaughters, but she said nothing further. Katie, however, looked daggers\nat the old man from out her big bright eyes. What right had any man,\nwere he ever so old, ever so much an uncle, to scold her mamma? Katie\nwas inclined to join her mother and take Harry Norman's side, for it was\nHarry Norman who owned the boat.\n\nThey were now at the church door, and they entered without saying\nanything further. Let us hope that charity, which surpasseth all other\nvirtues, guided their prayers while they were there, and filled their\nhearts. In the meantime Alaric, unconscious how he had been attacked and\nhow defended, worked hard at his Tavistock notes.\n\nMrs. Woodward was quite right in this, that the Commissioner of the\nMines, though he was unable to find time to go to church, did find time\nto saunter about with the girls before dinner. Was it to be expected\nthat he should not do so? for what other purpose was he there at\nHampton?\n\nThey were all very serious this Sunday afternoon, and Katie could make\nnothing of them. She and Charley, indeed, went off by themselves to a\ndesert island, or a place that would have been a desert island had the\nwater run round it, and there built stupendous palaces and laid out\nglorious gardens. Charley was the most good-natured of men, and could he\nhave only brought a boat with him, as Harry so often did, he would soon\nhave been first favourite with Katie.\n\n'It shan't be at all like Hampton Court,' said Katie, speaking of the\nnew abode which Charley was to build for her.\n\n'Not at all,' said Charley.\n\n'Nor yet Buckingham Palace.'\n\n'No,' said Charley, 'I think we'll have it Gothic.'\n\n'Gothic!' said Katie, looking up at him with all her eyes. 'Will Gothic\nbe most grand? What's Gothic?'\n\nCharley began to consider. 'Westminster Abbey,' said he at last.\n\n'Oh--but Charley, I don't want a church. Is the Alhambra Gothic?'\n\nCharley was not quite sure, but thought it probably was. They decided,\ntherefore, that the new palace should be built after the model of the\nAlhambra.\n\nThe afternoon was but dull and lugubrious to the remainder of the party.\nThe girls seemed to feel that there was something solemn about the\ncoming competition between two such dear friends, which prevented and\nshould prevent them all from being merry. Harry perfectly sympathized in\nthe feeling; and even Alaric, though depressed himself by no melancholy\nforebodings, was at any rate conscious that he should refrain from\nany apparent anticipation of a triumph. They all went to church in the\nevening; but even this amendment in Alaric's conduct hardly reconciled\nhim to Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'I suppose we shall all be very clever before long,' said she, after\ntea; 'but really I don't know that we shall be any the better for it.\nNow in this office of yours, by the end of next week, there will be\nthree or four men with broken hearts, and there will be one triumphant\njackanapes, so conceited and proud, that he'll never bring himself to\ndo another good ordinary day's work as long as he lives. Nothing will\npersuade me but that it is not only very bad, but very unjust also.'\n\n'The jackanapes must learn to put up with ordinary work,' said Alaric,\n'or he'll soon find himself reduced to his former insignificance.'\n\n'And the men with the broken hearts; they, I suppose, must put up with\ntheir wretchedness too,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'and their wives, also, and\nchildren, who have been looking forward for years to this vacancy as the\nperiod of their lives at which they are to begin to be comfortable. I\nhate such heartlessness. I hate the very name of Sir Gregory Hardlines.'\n\n'But, mamma, won't the general effect be to produce a much higher class\nof education among the men?' said Gertrude.\n\n'In the army and navy the best men get on the best,' said Linda.\n\n'Do they, by jingo!' said Uncle Bat. 'It's very little you know about\nthe navy, Miss Linda.'\n\n'Well, then, at any rate they ought,' said Linda.\n\n'I would have a competitive examination in every service,' said\nGertrude. 'It would make young men ambitious. They would not be so idle\nand empty as they now are, if they had to contend in this way for every\nstep upwards in the world.'\n\n'The world,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'will soon be like a fishpond,\nvery full of fish, but with very little food for them. Every one is\nscrambling for the others' prey, and they will end at last by eating one\nanother. If Harry gets this situation, will not that unfortunate Jones,\nwho for years has been waiting for it, always regard him as a robber?'\n\n'My maxim is this,' said Uncle Bat; 'if a youngster goes into any\nservice, say the navy, and does his duty by his country like a man, why,\nhe shouldn't be passed over. Now look at me; I was on the books of the\n_Catamaran_, one of the old seventy-fours, in '96; I did my duty then\nand always; was never in the black book or laid up sick; was always\nrough and ready for any work that came to hand; and when I went into the\n_Mudlark_ as lieutenant in year '9, little Bobby Howard had just joined\nthe old _Cat._ as a young middy. And where am I now? and where is Bobby\nHoward? Why, d----e, I'm on the shelf, craving the ladies' pardon; and\nhe's a Lord of the Admiralty, if you please, and a Member of Parliament.\nNow I say Cuttwater's as good a name as Howard for going to sea with any\nday; and if there'd been a competitive examination for Admiralty Lords\nfive years ago, Bobby Howard would never have been where he is now, and\nsomebody else who knows more about his profession than all the Howards\nput together, might perhaps have been in his place. And so, my lads,\nhere's to you, and I hope the best man will win.'\n\nWhether Uncle Bat agreed with his niece or with his grand-nieces was not\nvery apparent from the line of his argument; but they all laughed at his\neagerness, and nothing more was said that evening about the matter.\n\nAlaric, Harry, and Charley, of course returned to town on the following\nday. Breakfast on Monday morning at Surbiton Cottage was an early affair\nwhen the young men were there; so early, that Captain Cuttwater did not\nmake his appearance. Since his arrival at the cottage, Mrs. Woodward had\nfound an excuse for a later breakfast in the necessity of taking it with\nher uncle; so that the young people were generally left alone. Linda\nwas the family tea-maker, and was, therefore, earliest down; and Alaric\nbeing the first on this morning to leave the hotel, found her alone in\nthe dining-room.\n\nHe had never renewed the disclosure of his passion; but Linda had\nthought that whenever he shook hands with her since that memorable walk,\nshe had always felt a more than ordinary pressure. This she had been\ncareful not to return, but she had not the heart to rebuke it. Now, when\nhe bade her good morning, he certainly held her hand in his longer\nthan he need have done. He looked at her too, as though his looks meant\nsomething more than ordinary looking; at least so Linda thought; but\nyet he said nothing, and so Linda, slightly trembling, went on with the\nadjustment of her tea-tray.\n\n'It will be all over, Linda, when we meet again,' said Alaric. His mind\nshe found was intent on his examination, not on his love. But this was\nnatural, was as it should be. If--and she was certain in her heart that\nit would be so--if he should be successful, then he might speak of love\nwithout having to speak in the same breath of poverty as well. 'It will\nbe all over when we meet again,' he said.\n\n'I suppose it will,' said Linda.\n\n'I don't at all like it; it seems so unnatural having to contend against\none's friend. And yet one cannot help it; one cannot allow one's self to\ngo to the wall.'\n\n'I'm sure Harry doesn't mind it,' said Linda.\n\n'I'm sure I do,' said he. 'If I fail I shall be unhappy, and if I\nsucceed I shall be equally so. I shall set all the world against me. I\nknow what your mother meant when she talked of a jackanapes yesterday.\nIf I get the promotion I may wish good-bye to Surbiton Cottage.'\n\n'Oh, Alaric!'\n\n'Harry would forgive me; but Harry's friends would never do so.'\n\n'How can you say so? I am sure mamma has no such feeling, nor yet even\nGertrude; I mean that none of us have.'\n\n'It is very natural all of you should, for he is your cousin.'\n\n'You are just the same as our cousin. I am sure we think quite as much\nof you as of Harry. Even Gertrude said she hoped that you would get it.'\n\n'Dear Gertrude!'\n\n'Because, you know, Harry does not want it so much as you do. I am sure\nI wish you success with all my heart. Perhaps it's wicked to wish for\neither of you over the other; but you can't both get it at once, you\nknow.'\n\nAt this moment Katie came in, and soon afterwards Gertrude and the two\nother young men, and so nothing further was said on the subject.\n\nCharley parted with the competitors at the corner of Waterloo Bridge.\nHe turned into Somerset House, being there regarded on these Monday\nmornings as a prodigy of punctuality; and Alaric and Harry walked back\nalong the Strand, arm-in-arm, toward their own office.\n\n'Well, lads, I hope you'll both win,' said Charley. 'And whichever wins\nmost, why of course he'll stand an uncommon good dinner.'\n\n'Oh! that's of course,' said Alaric. 'We'll have it at the Trafalgar.'\n\nAnd so the two walked on together, arm-in-arm, to the Weights and\nMeasures.\n\nThe ceremony which was now about to take place at the Weights and\nMeasures was ordained to be the first of those examinations which,\nunder the auspices of Sir Gregory Hardlines, were destined to revivify,\nclarify, and render perfect the Civil Service of the country. It was a\ngreat triumph to Sir Gregory to see the darling object of his heart thus\ncommencing its existence in the very cradle in which he, as an infant\nHercules, had made his first exertions in the cause. It was to be his\nfuture fortune to superintend these intellectual contests, in a stately\noffice of his own, duly set apart and appointed for the purpose. But the\nthrone on which he was to sit had not yet been prepared for him, and he\nwas at present constrained to content himself with exercising his power,\nnow here and now there, according as his services might be required,\ncarrying the appurtenances of his royalty about with him.\n\nBut Sir Gregory was not a solitary monarch. In days long gone by there\nwere, as we all know, three kings at Cologne, and again three kings\nat Brentford. So also were there three kings at the Civil Service\nExamination Board. But of these three Sir Gregory was by far the\ngreatest king. He sat in the middle, had two thousand jewels to his\ncrown, whereas the others had only twelve hundred each, and his name\nran first in all the royal warrants. Nevertheless, Sir Gregory, could\nhe have had it so, would, like most other kings, have preferred an\nundivided sceptre.\n\nOf his co-mates on the throne the elder in rank was a west country\nbaronet, who, not content with fatting beeves and brewing beer like his\nsires, aspired to do something for his country. Sir Warwick Westend\nwas an excellent man, full of the best intentions, and not more than\ndecently anxious to get the good things of Government into his hand.\nHe was, perhaps, rather too much inclined to think that he could see\nfurther through a millstone than another, and had a way of looking as\nthough he were always making the attempt. He was a man born to grace, if\nnot his country, at any rate his county; and his conduct was uniformly\nsuch as to afford the liveliest satisfaction to his uncles, aunts, and\nrelations in general. If as a king he had a fault, it was this, that he\nallowed that other king, Sir Gregory, to carry him in his pocket.\n\nBut Sir Gregory could not at all get the third king into his pocket.\nThis gentleman was a worthy clergyman from Cambridge, one Mr. Jobbles by\nname. Mr. Jobbles had for many years been examining undergraduates for\nlittle goes and great goes, and had passed his life in putting posing\nquestions, in detecting ignorance by viva voce scrutiny, and eliciting\nlearning by printed papers. He, by a stupendous effort of his\nmathematical mind, had divided the adult British male world into classes\nand sub-classes, and could tell at a moment's notice how long it would\ntake him to examine them all. His soul panted for the work. Every man\nshould, he thought, be made to pass through some 'go.' The\ngreengrocer's boy should not carry out cabbages unless his fitness\nfor cabbage-carrying had been ascertained, and till it had also been\nascertained that no other boy, ambitious of the preferment, would carry\nthem better. Difficulty! There was no difficulty. Could not he, Jobbles,\nget through 5,000 viva voces in every five hours--that is, with due\nassistance? and would not 55,000 printed papers, containing 555,000\nquestions, be getting themselves answered at the same time, with more or\nless precision?\n\nSo now Mr. Jobbles was about to try his huge plan by a small\ncommencement.\n\nOn the present occasion the examination was actually to be carried on by\ntwo of the kings in person. Sir Gregory had declared that as so large a\nportion of his heart and affections was bound up with the gentlemen of\nthe Weights and Measures, he could not bring himself actually to ask\nquestions of them, and then to listen to or read their answers. Should\nany of his loved ones make some fatal _faux pas_, his tears, like those\nof the recording angel, would blot out the error. His eyes would refuse\nto see faults, if there should be faults, in those whom he himself had\nnurtured. Therefore, though he came with his colleagues to the Weights\nand Measures, he did not himself take part in the examination.\n\nAt eleven o'clock the Board-room was opened, and the candidates walked\nin and seated themselves. Fear of Sir Gregory, and other causes, had\nthinned the number. Poor Jones, who by right of seniority should have\nhad the prize, declined to put himself in competition with his juniors,\nand in lieu thereof sent up to the Lords of the Treasury an awful\nmemorial spread over fifteen folio pages--very uselessly. The Lords\nof the Treasury referred it to the three kings, whose secretary put a\nminute upon it. Sir Gregory signed the minute, and some gentleman at\nthe Treasury wrote a short letter to Mr. Jones, apprising that unhappy\ngentleman that my Lords had taken the matter into their fullest\nconsideration, and that nothing could be done to help him. Had Jones\nbeen consulted by any other disappointed Civil Service Werter as to the\nexpediency of complaining to the Treasury Lords, Jones would have told\nhim exactly what would be the result. The disappointed one, however,\nalways thinks that all the Treasury Lords will give all their ears to\nhim, though they are deafer than Icarus to the world beside.\n\nRobinson stood his ground like a man; but Brown found out, a day or\ntwo before the struggle came, that he could not bring himself to\nstand against his friend. Jones, he said, he knew was incompetent, but\nRobinson ought to get it; so he, for one, would not stand in Robinson's\nway.\n\nUppinall was there, as confident as a bantam cock; and so was Alphabet\nPrecis, who had declared to all his friends that if the pure well of\nofficial English undefiled was to count for anything, he ought to be\npretty safe. But poor Minusex was ill, and sent a certificate. He had\nso crammed himself with unknown quantities, that his mind--like a\ngourmand's stomach--had broken down under the effort, and he was now\nsobbing out algebraic positions under his counterpane.\n\nNorman and Alaric made up the five who still had health, strength, and\npluck to face the stern justice of the new kings; and they accordingly\ntook their seats on five chairs, equally distant, placing themselves in\ndue order of seniority.\n\nAnd then, first of all, Sir Gregory made a little speech, standing up at\nthe head of the Board-room table, with an attendant king on either hand,\nand the Secretary, and two Assistant-Secretaries, standing near him. Was\nnot this a proud moment for Sir Gregory?\n\n'It had now become his duty,' he said, 'to take his position in that\nroom, that well-known, well-loved room, under circumstances of which he\nhad little dreamt when he first entered it with awe-struck steps, in\nthe days of his early youth. But, nevertheless, even then ambition had\nwarmed him. That ambition had been to devote every energy of his mind,\nevery muscle of his body, every hour of his life, to the Civil Service\nof his country. It was not much, perhaps, that he had been able to do;\nhe could not boast of those acute powers of mind, of that gigantic grasp\nof intellect, of which they saw in those days so wonderful an example in\na high place.' Sir Gregory here gratefully alluded to that statesman who\nhad given him his present appointment. 'But still he had devoted all his\nmind, such as it was, and every hour of his life, to the service; and\nnow he had his reward. If he might be allowed to give advice to the\ngentlemen before him, gentlemen of whose admirable qualifications for\nthe Civil Service of the country he himself was so well aware, his\nadvice should be this--That they should look on none of their energies\nas applicable to private purposes, regard none of their hours as their\nown. They were devoted in a peculiar way to the Civil Service, and they\nshould feel that such was their lot in life. They should know that their\nintellects were a sacred pledge intrusted to them for the good of that\nservice, and should use them accordingly. This should be their highest\nambition. And what higher ambition,' asked Sir Gregory, 'could they\nhave? They all, alas! knew that the service had been disgraced in\nother quarters by idleness, incompetency, and, he feared he must\nsay, dishonesty; till incompetency and dishonesty had become, not the\nexception, but the rule. It was too notorious that the Civil Service was\nfilled by the family fools of the aristocracy and middle classes, and\nthat any family who had no fool to send, sent in lieu thereof some\ninvalid past hope. Thus the service had become a hospital for incurables\nand idiots. It was,' said Sir Gregory, 'for him and them to cure\nall that. He would not,' he said, 'at that moment, say anything with\nreference to salaries. It was, as they were all aware, a very difficult\nsubject, and did not seem to be necessarily connected with the few\nremarks which the present opportunity had seemed to him to call for.'\nHe then told them they were all his beloved children; that they were a\ncredit to the establishment; that he handed them over without a blush to\nhis excellent colleagues, Sir Warwick Westend and Mr. Jobbles, and that\nhe wished in his heart that each of them could be successful. And having\nso spoken, Sir Gregory went his way.\n\nIt was beautiful then to see how Mr. Jobbles swam down the long room\nand handed out his examination papers to the different candidates as he\npassed them. 'Twas a pity there should have been but five; the man did\nit so well, so quickly, with such a gusto! He should have been allowed\nto try his hand upon five hundred instead of five. His step was so rapid\nand his hand and arm moved so dexterously, that no conceivable number\nwould have been too many for him. But, even with five, he showed at once\nthat the right man was in the right place. Mr. Jobbles was created for\nthe conducting of examinations.\n\nAnd then the five candidates, who had hitherto been all ears, of a\nsudden became all eyes, and devoted themselves in a manner which would\nhave been delightful to Sir Gregory, to the papers before them. Sir\nWarwick, in the meantime, was seated in his chair, hard at work looking\nthrough his millstone.\n\nIt is a dreadful task that of answering examination papers--only to\nbe exceeded in dreadfulness by the horrors of Mr. Jobbles' viva voce\ntorments. A man has before him a string of questions, and he looks\npainfully down them, from question to question, searching for some\nallusion to that special knowledge which he has within him. He too often\nfinds that no such allusion is made. It appears that the Jobbles of the\noccasion has exactly known the blank spots of his mind and fitted them\nall. He has perhaps crammed himself with the winds and tides, and there\nis no more reference to those stormy subjects than if Luna were extinct;\nbut he has, unfortunately, been loose about his botany, and question\nafter question would appear to him to have been dictated by Sir Joseph\nPaxton or the head-gardener at Kew. And then to his own blank face and\npuzzled look is opposed the fast scribbling of some botanic candidate,\nfast as though reams of folio could hardly contain all the knowledge\nwhich he is able to pour forth.\n\nAnd so, with a mixture of fast-scribbling pens and blank faces, our five\nfriends went to work. The examination lasted for four days, and it\nwas arranged that on each of the four days each of the five candidates\nshould be called up to undergo a certain quantum of Mr. Jobbles' viva\nvoce. This part of his duty Mr. Jobbles performed with a mildness of\nmanner that was beyond all praise. A mother training her first-born to\nsay 'papa,' could not do so with a softer voice, or more affectionate\ndemeanour.\n\n'The planet Jupiter,' said he to Mr. Precis; 'I have no doubt you know\naccurately the computed distance of that planet from the sun, and also\nthat of our own planet. Could you tell me now, how would you calculate\nthe distance in inches, say from London Bridge to the nearest portion of\nJupiter's disc, at twelve o'clock on the first of April?' Mr. Jobbles,\nas he put his little question, smiled the sweetest of smiles, and spoke\nin a tone conciliating and gentle, as though he were asking Mr. Precis\nto dine with him and take part of a bottle of claret at half-past six.\n\nBut, nevertheless, Mr. Precis looked very blank.\n\n'I am not asking the distance, you know,' said Mr. Jobbles, smiling\nsweeter than ever; 'I am only asking how you would compute it.'\n\nBut still Mr. Precis looked exceedingly blank.\n\n'Never mind,' said Mr. Jobbles, with all the encouragement which his\nvoice could give, 'never mind. Now, suppose that _a_ be a milestone; _b_\na turnpike-gate--,' and so on.\n\nBut Mr. Jobbles, in spite of his smiles, so awed the hearts of some of\nhis candidates, that two of them retired at the end of the second day.\nPoor Robinson, thinking, and not without sufficient ground, that he\nhad not a ghost of a chance, determined to save himself from further\nannoyance; and then Norman, put utterly out of conceit with himself by\nwhat he deemed the insufficiency of his answers, did the same. He had\nbecome low in spirits, unhappy in temperament, and self-diffident to a\npainful degree. Alaric, to give him his due, did everything in his power\nto persuade him to see the task out to the last. But the assurance and\ncomposure of Alaric's manner did more than anything else to provoke and\nincrease Norman's discomfiture. He had been schooling himself to bear a\nbeating with a good grace, and he began to find that he could only bear\nit as a disgrace. On the morning of the third day, instead of taking\nhis place in the Board-room, he sent in a note to Mr. Jobbles, declaring\nthat he withdrew from the trial. Mr. Jobbles read the note, and\nsmiled with satisfaction as he put it into his pocket. It was an\nacknowledgement of his own unrivalled powers as an Examiner.\n\nMr. Precis, still trusting to his pure well, went on to the end, and at\nthe end declared that so ignorant was Mr. Jobbles of his duty that he\nhad given them no opportunity of showing what they could do in English\ncomposition. Why had he not put before them the papers in some memorable\nofficial case, and desired them to make an abstract; those, for\ninstance, on the much-vexed question of penny versus pound, as touching\nthe new standard for the decimal coinage? Mr. Jobbles an Examiner\nindeed! And so Mr. Precis bethought himself that he also, if\nunsuccessful, would go to the Lords of the Treasury.\n\nAnd Mr. Uppinall and Alaric Tudor also went on. Those who knew anything\nof the matter, when they saw how the running horses were reduced in\nnumber, and what horses were left on the course--when they observed also\nhow each steed came to the post on each succeeding morning, had no doubt\nwhatever of the result. So that when Alaric was declared on the Saturday\nmorning to have gained the prize, there was very little astonishment\neither felt or expressed at the Weights and Measures.\n\nAlaric's juniors wished him joy with some show of reality in their\nmanner; but the congratulations of his seniors, including the Secretary\nand Assistant-Secretaries, the new Chief Clerk and the men in the class\nto which he was now promoted, were very cold indeed. But to this he was\nindifferent. It was the nature of Tudor's disposition, that he never for\na moment rested satisfied with the round of the ladder on which he\nhad contrived to place himself. He had no sooner gained a step than he\nlooked upwards to see how the next step was to be achieved. His motto\nmight well have been 'Excelsior!' if only he could have taught himself\nto look to heights that were really high. When he found that the august\nSecretary received him on his promotion without much _empressement_, he\ncomforted himself by calculating how long it would be before he should\nfill that Secretary's chair--if indeed it should ever be worth his while\nto fill it.\n\nThe Secretary at the Weights and Measures had, after all, but a\ndull time of it, and was precluded by the routine of his office from\nparliamentary ambition and the joys of government. Alaric was already\nbeginning to think that this Weights and Measures should only be a\nstepping-stone to him; and that when Sir Gregory, with his stern dogma\nof devotion to the service, had been of sufficient use to him, he also\nmight with advantage be thrown over. In the meantime an income of \u00c2\u00a3600\na year brought with it to the young bachelor some very comfortable\ninfluence. But the warmest and the pleasantest of all the\ncongratulations which he received was from his dear friend Undy Scott.\n\n'Ah, my boy,' said Undy, pressing his hand, 'you'll soon be one of us.\nBy the by, I want to put you up for the Downing; you should leave that\nPythagorean: there's nothing to be got by it.'\n\nNow, the Downing was a political club, in which, however, politics\nhad latterly become a good deal mixed. But the Government of the day\ngenerally found there a liberal support, and recognized and acknowledged\nits claim to consideration.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nCONSOLATION\n\n\nOn the following Sunday neither Tudor nor Norman was at Hampton. They\nhad both felt that they could not comfortably meet each other there, and\neach had declined to go. They had promised to write; and now that the\nmatter was decided, how were they or either of them to keep the promise?\n\nIt may be thought that the bitterness of the moment was over with Norman\nas soon as he gave up; but such was not the case. Let him struggle as he\nwould with himself he could not rally, nor bring himself to feel happy\non what had occurred. He would have been better satisfied if Alaric\nwould have triumphed; but Alaric seemed to take it all as a matter of\ncourse, and never spoke of his own promotion unless he did so in answer\nto some remark of his companion; then he could speak easily enough;\notherwise he was willing to let the matter go by as one settled and\nat rest. He had consulted Norman about the purchase of a horse, but he\nhitherto had shown no other sign that he was a richer man than formerly.\n\nIt was a very bitter time for Norman. He could not divest his mind of\nthe subject. What was he to do? Where was he to go? How was he to get\naway, even for a time, from Alaric Tudor? And then, was he right in\nwishing to get away from him? Had he not told himself, over and over\nagain, that it behoved him as a man and a friend and a Christian to\nconquer the bitter feeling of envy which preyed on his spirits? Had he\nnot himself counselled Alaric to stand this examination? and had he\nnot promised that his doing so should make no difference in their\nfriendship? Had he not pledged himself to rejoice in the success of\nhis friend? and now was he to break his word both to that friend and to\nhimself?\n\nSchooling himself, or trying to school himself in this way, he made no\nattempt at escaping from his unhappiness. They passed the Wednesday,\nThursday, and Friday evenings together. It was now nearly the end of\nSeptember, and London was empty; that is, empty as regards those friends\nand acquaintances with whom Norman might have found some resource. On\nthe Saturday they left their office early; for all office routine had,\nduring this week, been broken through by the immense importance of the\nceremony which was going on; and then it became necessary to write to\nMrs. Woodward.\n\n'Will you write to Hampton or shall I?' said Alaric, as they walked\narm-in-arm under the windows of Whitehall.\n\n'Oh! you, of course,' said Norman; 'you have much to tell them; I have\nnothing.'\n\n'Just as you please,' said the other. 'That is, of course, I will if you\nlike it. But I think it would come better from you. You are nearer to\nthem than I am; and it will have less a look of triumph on my part, and\nless also of disappointment on yours, if you write. If you tell them\nthat you literally threw away your chance, you will only tell them the\ntruth.'\n\nNorman assented, but he said nothing further. What business had Alaric\nto utter such words as triumph and disappointment? He could not keep his\narm, on which Alaric was leaning, from spasmodically shrinking from the\ntouch. He had been beaten by a man, nay worse, had yielded to a man, who\nhad not the common honesty to refuse a bribe; and yet he was bound to\nlove this man. He could not help asking himself the question which he\nwould do. Would he love him or hate him?\n\nBut while he was so questioning himself, he got home, and had to\nsit down and write his letter--this he did at once, but not without\ndifficulty. It ran as follows:--\n\n'My dear Mrs. Woodward,--\n\n'I write a line to tell you of my discomfiture and Alaric's success.\nI gave up at the end of the second day. Of course I will tell you all\nabout it when we meet. No one seemed to doubt that Alaric would get it,\nas a matter of course. I shall be with you on next Saturday. Alaric\nsays he will not go down till the Saturday after, when I shall be at\nNormansgrove. My best love to the girls. Tell Katie I shan't drown\neither myself or the boat.\n\n'Yours ever affectionately,\n\n'H. N.\n\n'Saturday, September, 185-.\n\n'Pray write me a kind letter to comfort me.'\n\nMrs. Woodward did write him a very kind letter, and it did comfort him.\nAnd she wrote also, as she was bound to do, a letter of congratulation\nto Alaric. This letter, though it expressed in the usual terms the\nsatisfaction which one friend has in another's welfare, was not written\nin the same warm affectionate tone as that to Norman. Alaric perceived\ninstantly that it was not cordial. He loved Mrs. Woodward dearly, and\ngreatly desired her love and sympathy. But what then? He could not have\neverything. He determined, therefore, not to trouble his mind. If Mrs.\nWoodward did not sympathize with him, others of the family would do\nso; and success would ultimately bring her round. What woman ever yet\nrefused to sympathize with successful ambition?\n\nAlaric also received a letter from Captain Cuttwater, in which\nthat gallant veteran expressed his great joy at the result of the\nexamination--'Let the best man win all the world over,' said he,\n'whatever his name is. And they'll have to make the same rule at the\nAdmiralty too. The days of the Howards are gone by; that is, unless they\ncan prove themselves able seamen, which very few of them ever did yet.\nLet the best man win; that's what I say; and let every man get his fair\nshare of promotion.' Alaric did not despise the sympathy of Captain\nCuttwater. It might turn out that even Captain Cuttwater could be made\nof use.\n\nMrs. Woodward's letter to Harry was full of the tenderest affection.\nIt was a flattering, soothing, loving letter, such as no man ever could\nhave written. It was like oil poured into his wounds, and made him feel\nthat the world was not all harsh to him. He had determined not to go to\nHampton that Saturday; but Mrs. Woodward's letter almost made him rush\nthere at once that he might throw himself into her arms--into her arms,\nand at her daughter's feet. The time had now come to him when he wanted\nto be comforted by the knowledge that his love was returned. He resolved\nthat during his next visit he would formally propose to Gertrude.\n\nThe determination to do this, and a strong hope that he might do it\nsuccessfully, kept him up during the interval. On the following week\nhe was to go to his father's place to shoot, having obtained leave of\nabsence for a month; and he felt that he could still enjoy himself if\nhe could take with him the conviction that all was right at Surbiton\nCottage. Mrs. Woodward, in her letter, though she had spoken much of\nthe girls, had said nothing special about Gertrude. Nevertheless, Norman\ngathered from it that she intended that he should go thither to look for\ncomfort, and that he would find there the comfort that he required.\n\nAnd Mrs. Woodward had intended that such should be the effect of her\nletter. It was at present the dearest wish of her heart to see Norman\nand Gertrude married. That Norman had often declared his love to her\neldest daughter she knew very well, and she knew also that Gertrude\nhad never rejected him. Having perfect confidence in her child, she had\npurposely abstained from saying anything that could bias her opinion.\nShe had determined to leave the matter in the hands of the young people\nthemselves, judging that it might be best arranged as a true love-match\nbetween them, without interference from her; she had therefore said\nnothing to Gertrude on the subject.\n\nMrs. Woodward, however, discovered that she was in error, when it\nwas too late for her to retrieve her mistake; and, indeed, had she\ndiscovered it before that letter was written, what could she have done?\nShe could not have forbidden Harry to come to her house--she could not\nhave warned him not to throw himself at her daughter's feet. The cup was\nprepared for his lips, and it was necessary that he should drink of it.\nThere was nothing for which she could blame him; nothing for which she\ncould blame herself; nothing for which she did blame her daughter. It\nwas sorrowful, pitiful, to be lamented, wept for, aye, and groaned for;\nmany inward groans it cost her; but it was at any rate well that she\ncould attribute her sorrow to the spite of circumstances rather than to\nthe ill-conduct of those she loved.\n\nNor would it have been fair to blame Gertrude in the matter. While she\nwas yet a child, this friend of her mother's had been thrown with her,\nand when she was little more than a child, she found that this friend\nhad become a lover. She liked him, in one sense loved him, and was\naccustomed to regard him as one whom it would be almost wrong in her not\nto like and love. What wonder then that when he first spoke to her warm\nwords of adoration, she had not been able at once to know her own heart,\nand tell him that his hopes would be in vain?\n\nShe perceived by instinct, rather than by spoken words, that her mother\nwas favourable to this young lover, that if she accepted him she would\nplease her mother, that the course of true love might in their case run\nsmooth. What wonder then that she should have hesitated before she found\nit necessary to say that she could not, would not, be Harry Norman's\nwife?\n\nOn the Saturday morning, the morning of that night which was, as he\nhoped, to see him go to bed a happy lover, so happy in his love as to be\nable to forget his other sorrows, she was sitting alone with her mother.\nIt was natural that their conversation should turn to Alaric and Harry.\nAlaric, with his happy prospects, was soon dismissed; but Mrs. Woodward\ncontinued to sing the praises of him who, had she been potent with the\nmagi of the Civil Service, would now be the lion of the Weights and\nMeasures.\n\n'I must say I think it was weak of him to retire,' said Gertrude.\n'Alaric says in his letter to Uncle Bat, that had he persevered he would\nin all probability have been successful.'\n\n'I should rather say that it was generous,' said her mother.\n\n'Well, I don't know, mamma; that of course depends on his motives;\nbut wouldn't generosity of that sort between two young men in such a\nposition be absurd?'\n\n'You mean that such regard for his friend would be Quixotic.'\n\n'Yes, mamma.'\n\n'Perhaps it would. All true generosity, all noble feeling, is now called\nQuixotic. But surely, Gertrude, you and I should not quarrel with Harry\non that account.'\n\n'I think he got frightened, mamma, and had not nerve to go through with\nit.'\n\nMrs. Woodward looked vexed; but she made no immediate reply, and for\nsome time the mother and daughter went on working without further\nconversation. At last Gertrude said:--\n\n'I think every man is bound to do the best he can for himself--that is,\nhonestly; there is something spoony in one man allowing another to get\nbefore him, as long as he can manage to be first himself.'\n\nMrs. Woodward did not like the tone in which her daughter spoke. She\nfelt that it boded ill for Harry's welfare; and she tried, but tried in\nvain, to elicit from her daughter the expression of a kinder feeling.\n\n'Well, my dear, I must say I think you are hard on him. But, probably,\njust at present you have the spirit of contradiction in you. If I were\nto begin to abuse him, perhaps I should get you to praise him.'\n\n'Oh, mamma, I did not abuse him.'\n\n'Something like it, my dear, when you said he was spoony.'\n\n'Oh, mamma, I would not abuse him for worlds--I know how good he is,\nI know how you love him, but, but---' and Gertrude, though very little\ngiven to sobbing moods, burst into tears.\n\n'Come here, Gertrude; come here, my child,' said Mrs. Woodward, now\nmoved more for her daughter than for her favourite; 'what is it? what\nmakes you cry? I did not really mean that you abused poor Harry.'\n\nGertrude got up from her chair, knelt at her mother's feet, and hid her\nface in her mother's lap. 'Oh, mamma,' she said, with a half-smothered\nvoice, 'I know what you mean; I know what you wish; but--but--but, oh,\nmamma, you must not--must not, must not think of it any more.'\n\n'Then may God help him!' said Mrs. Woodward, gently caressing her\ndaughter, who was still sobbing with her face buried in her mother's\nlap. 'May God Almighty lighten the blow to him! But oh, Gertrude, I had\nhoped, I had so hoped----'\n\n'Oh, mamma, don't, pray don't,' and Gertrude sobbed as though she were\ngoing into hysterics.\n\n'No, my child, I will not say another word. Dear as he is to me, you are\nand must be ten times dearer. There, Gertrude, it is over now; over at\nleast between us. We know each other's hearts now. It is my fault that\nwe did not do so sooner.' They did understand each other at last, and\nthe mother made no further attempt to engage her daughter's love for the\nman she would have chosen as her daughter's husband.\n\nBut still the worst was to come, as Mrs. Woodward well knew--and as\nGertrude knew also; to come, too, on this very day. Mrs. Woodward, with\na woman's keen perception, felt assured that Harry Norman, when he\nfound himself at the Cottage, freed from the presence of the successful\ncandidate, surrounded by the affectionate faces of all her circle, would\nmelt at once and look to his love for consolation. She understood the\nfeelings of his heart as well as though she had read them in a book; and\nyet she could do nothing to save him from his fresh sorrows. The cup\nwas prepared for him, and it was necessary that he should drink it.\nShe could not tell him, could not tell even him, that her daughter had\nrejected him, when as yet he had made no offer.\n\nAnd so Harry Norman hurried down to his fate. When he reached the\nCottage, Mrs. Woodward and Linda and Katie were in the drawing-room.\n\n'Harry, my dear Harry,' said Mrs. Woodward, rushing to him, throwing\nher arms round him, and kissing him; 'we know it all, we understand it\nall--my fine, dear, good Harry.'\n\nHarry was melted in a moment, and in the softness of his mood kissed\nKatie too, and Linda also. Katie he had often kissed, but never Linda,\ncousins though they were. Linda merely laughed, but Norman blushed; for\nhe remembered that had it so chanced that Gertrude had been there, he\nwould not have dared to kiss her.\n\n'Oh, Harry,' said Katie, 'we are so sorry--that is, not sorry about\nAlaric, but sorry about you. Why were there not two prizes?'\n\n'It's all right as it is, Katie,' said he; 'we need none of us be sorry\nat all. Alaric is a clever fellow; everybody gave him credit for it\nbefore, and now he has proved that everybody is right.'\n\n'He is older than you, you know, and therefore he ought to be cleverer,'\nsaid Katie, trying to make things pleasant.\n\nAnd then they went out into the garden. But where was Gertrude all this\ntime? She had been in the drawing-room a moment before his arrival. They\nwalked out into the lawn, but nothing was said about her absence. Norman\ncould not bring himself to ask for her, and Mrs. Woodward could not\ntrust herself to talk of her.\n\n'Where is the captain?' said Harry.\n\n'He's at Hampton Court,' said Linda; 'he has found another navy captain\nthere, and he goes over every day to play backgammon.' As they were\nspeaking, however, the captain walked through the house on to the lawn.\n\n'Well, Norman, how are you, how are you? sorry you couldn't all win. But\nyou're a man of fortune, you know, so it doesn't signify.'\n\n'Not a great deal of fortune,' said Harry, looking sheepish.\n\n'Well, I only hope the best man got it. Now, at the Admiralty the worst\nman gets it always.'\n\n'The worst man didn't get it here,' said Harry.\n\n'No, no,' said Uncle Bat, 'I'm sure he did not; nor he won't long at the\nAdmiralty either, I can tell them that. But where's Gertrude?'\n\n'She's in her bedroom, dressing for dinner,' said Katie.\n\n'Hoity toity,' said Uncle Bat, 'she's going to make herself very grand\nto-day. That's all for you, Master Norman. Well, I suppose we may all\ngo in and get ready; but mind, I have got no sweetheart, and so I shan't\nmake myself grand at all;' and so they all went in to dress for dinner.\n\nWhen Norman came down, Gertrude was in the drawing-room alone. But he\nknew that they would be alone but for a minute, and that a minute would\nnot serve for his purpose. She said one soft gentle word of condolence\nto him, some little sentence that she had been studying to pronounce.\nAll her study was thrown away; for Norman, in his confusion, did not\nunderstand a word that she spoke. Her tone, however, was kind and\naffectionate; and she shook hands with him apparently with cordiality.\nHe, however, ventured no kiss with her. He did not even press her hand,\nwhen for a moment he held it within his own.\n\nDinner was soon over, and the autumn evening still admitted of their\ngoing out. Norman was not sorry to urge the fact that the ladies had\ndone so, as an excuse to Captain Cuttwater for not sitting with him\nover his wine. He heard their voices in the garden, and went out to\njoin them, prepared to ascertain his fate if fortune would give him an\nopportunity of doing so. He found the party to consist of Mrs. Woodward,\nLinda, and Katie; Gertrude was not there.\n\n'I think the evenings get warmer as the winter gets nearer,' said Harry.\n\n'Yes,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'but they are so dangerous. The night comes\non all at once, and then the air is so damp and cold.'\n\nAnd so they went on talking about the weather.\n\n'Your boat is up in London, I know, Harry,' said Katie, with a voice of\nreproach, but at the same time with a look of entreaty.\n\n'Yes, it's at Searle's,' said Norman.\n\n'But the punt is here,' said Katie.\n\n'Not this evening, Katie,' said he.\n\n'Katie, how can you be such a tease?' said Mrs. Woodward; 'you'll make\nHarry hate the island, and you too. I wonder you can be so selfish.'\n\nPoor Katie's eyes became suffused with tears.\n\n'My dear Katie, it's very bad of me, isn't it?' said Norman, 'and the\nfine weather so nearly over too; I ought to take you, oughtn't I? come,\nwe will go.'\n\n'No, we won't,' said Katie, taking his big hand in both her little\nones, 'indeed we won't. It was very wrong of me to bother you; and you\nwith--with--with so much to think of. Dear Harry, I don't want to go at\nall, indeed I don't,' and she turned away from the little path which led\nto the place where the punt was moored.\n\nThey sauntered on for a while together, and then Norman left them.\nHe said nothing, but merely stole away from the lawn towards the\ndrawing-room window. Mrs. Woodward well knew with what object he went,\nand would have spared him from his immediate sorrow by following him;\nbut she judged that it would be better both for him and for her daughter\nthat he should learn the truth.\n\nHe went in through the open drawing-room window, and found Gertrude\nalone. She was on the sofa with a book in her hand; and had he been able\nto watch her closely he would have seen that the book trembled as he\nentered the room. But he was unable to watch anything closely. His own\nheart beat so fast, his own confusion was so great, that he could hardly\nsee the girl whom he now hoped to gain as his wife. Had Alaric been\ncoming to his wooing, he would have had every faculty at his call. But\nthen Alaric could not have loved as Norman loved.\n\nAnd so we will leave them. In about half an hour, when the short\ntwilight was becoming dusk, Mrs. Woodward returned, and found Norman\nstanding alone on the hearthrug before the fireplace. Gertrude was away,\nand he was leaning against the mantelpiece, with his hands behind\nhis back, staring at vacancy; but oh! with such an aspect of dull,\nspeechless agony in his face.\n\nMrs. Woodward looked up at him, and would have burst into tears, had\nshe not remembered that they would not be long alone; she therefore\nrestrained herself, but gave one involuntary sigh; and then, taking off\nher bonnet, placed herself where she might sit without staring at him in\nhis sorrow.\n\nKatie came in next. 'Oh! Harry, it's so lucky we didn't start in the\npunt,' said she, 'for it's going to pour, and we never should have been\nback from the island in that slow thing.'\n\nNorman looked at her and tried to smile, but the attempt was a ghastly\nfailure. Katie, gazing up into his face, saw that he was unhappy, and\nslunk away, without further speech, to her distant chair. There, from\ntime to time, she would look up at him, and her little heart melted with\nruth to see the depth of his misery. 'Why, oh why,' thought she, 'should\nthat greedy Alaric have taken away the only prize?'\n\nAnd then Linda came running in with her bonnet ribbons all moist with\nthe big raindrops. 'You are a nice squire of dames,' said she, 'to leave\nus all out to get wet through by ourselves;' and then she also, looking\nup, saw that jesting was at present ill-timed, and so sat herself down\nquietly at the tea-table.\n\nBut Norman never moved. He saw them come in one after another. He saw\nthe pity expressed in Mrs. Woodward's face; he heard the light-hearted\nvoices of the two girls, and observed how, when they saw him, their\nlight-heartedness was abashed; but still he neither spoke nor moved. He\nhad been stricken with a fearful stroke, and for a while was powerless.\n\nCaptain Cuttwater, having shaken off his dining-room nap, came for his\ntea; and then, at last, Gertrude also, descending from her own chamber,\nglided quietly into the room. When she did so, Norman, with a struggle,\nroused himself, and took a chair next to Mrs. Woodward, and opposite to\nher eldest daughter.\n\nWho could describe the intense discomfiture of that tea-party, or paint\nin fitting colours the different misery of each one there assembled?\nEven Captain Cuttwater at once knew that something was wrong, and\nmunched his bread-and-butter and drank his tea in silence. Linda\nsurmised what had taken place; though she was surprised, she was left\nwithout any doubt. Poor Katie was still in the dark, but she also knew\nthat there was cause for sorrow, and crept more and more into her little\nself. Mrs. Woodward sat with averted face, and ever and anon she put\nher handkerchief to her eyes. Gertrude was very pale, and all but\nmotionless, but she had schooled herself, and managed to drink her tea\nwith more apparent indifference than any of the others. Norman sat as\nhe had before been standing, with that dreadful look of agony upon his\nbrow.\n\nImmediately after tea Mrs. Woodward got up and went to her\ndressing-room. Her dressing-room, though perhaps not improperly so\ncalled, was not an exclusive closet devoted to combs, petticoats, and\nsoap and water. It was a comfortable snug room, nicely furnished, with\nsofa and easy chairs, and often open to others besides her handmaidens.\nThither she betook herself, that she might weep unseen; but in about\ntwenty minutes her tears were disturbed by a gentle knock at the door.\n\nVery soon after she went, Gertrude also left the room, and then Katie\ncrept off.\n\n'I have got a headache to-night,' said Norman, after the remaining three\nhad sat silent for a minute or two; 'I think I'll go across and go to\nbed.'\n\n'A headache!' said Linda. 'Oh, I am so sorry that you have got to go to\nthat horrid inn.'\n\n'Oh! I shall do very well there,' said Norman, trying to smile.\n\n'Will you have my room?' said the captain good-naturedly; 'any sofa does\nfor me.'\n\nNorman assured them as well as he could that his present headache was of\nsuch a nature that a bed at the inn would be the best thing for him; and\nthen, shaking hands with them, he moved to the door.\n\n'Stop a moment, Harry,' said Linda, 'and let me tell mamma. She'll give\nyou something for your head.' He made a sign to her, however, to let him\npass, and then, creeping gently upstairs, he knocked at Mrs. Woodward's\ndoor.\n\n'Come in,' said Mrs. Woodward, and Harry Norman, with all his sorrows\nstill written on his face, stood before her.\n\n'Oh! Harry,' said she, 'come in; I am so glad that you have come to\nme. Oh! Harry, dear Harry, what shall I say to comfort you? What can I\nsay--what can I do?'\n\nNorman, forgetting his manhood, burst into tears, and throwing himself\non a sofa, buried his face on the arm and sobbed like a young girl. But\nthe tears of a man bring with them no comfort as do those of the softer\nsex. He was a strong tall man, and it was dreadful to see him thus\nconvulsed.\n\nMrs. Woodward stood by him, and put her hand caressingly on his\nshoulder. She saw he had striven to speak, and had found himself unable\nto do so. 'I know how it is,' said she, 'you need not tell me; I know\nit all. Would that she could have seen you with my eyes; would that she\ncould have judged you with my mind!'\n\n'Oh, Mrs. Woodward!'\n\n'To me, Harry, you should have been the dearest, the most welcome son.\nBut you are so still. No son could be dearer. Oh, that she could have\nseen you as I see you!'\n\n'There is no hope,' said he. He did not put it as a question; but Mrs.\nWoodward saw that it was intended that she should take it as such if she\npleased. What could she say to him? She knew that there was no hope.\nHad it been Linda, Linda might have been moulded to her will. But with\nGertrude there could now be no hope. What could she say? She knelt down\nand kissed his brow, and mingled her tears with his.\n\n'Oh, Harry--oh, Harry! my dearest, dearest son!'\n\n'Oh, Mrs. Woodward, I have loved her so truly.'\n\nWhat could Mrs. Woodward do but cry also? what but that, and throw such\nblame as she could upon her own shoulders? She was bound to defend her\ndaughter.\n\n'It has been my fault, Harry,' she said; 'it is I whom you must blame,\nnot poor Gertrude.'\n\n'I blame no one,' said he.\n\n'I know you do not; but it is I whom you should blame. I should have\nlearnt how her heart stood, and have prevented this--but I thought, I\nthought it would have been otherwise.'\n\nNorman looked up at her, and took her hand, and pressed it. 'I will go\nnow,' he said, 'and don't expect me here to-morrow. I could not come in.\nSay that I thought it best to go to town because I am unwell. Good-bye,\nMrs. Woodward; pray write to me. I can't come to the Cottage now for a\nwhile, but pray write to me: do not you forget me, Mrs. Woodward.'\n\nMrs. Woodward fell upon his breast and wept, and bade God bless him, and\ncalled him her son and her dearest friend, and sobbed till her heart was\nnigh to break. 'What,' she thought, 'what could her daughter wish for,\nwhen she repulsed from her feet such a suitor as Harry Norman?'\n\nHe then went quietly down the stairs, quietly out of the house, and\nhaving packed up his bag at the inn, started off through the pouring\nrain, and walked away through the dark stormy night, through the dirt\nand mud and wet, to his London lodgings; nor was he again seen at\nSurbiton Cottage for some months after this adventure.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nA COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANCE\n\n\nNorman's dark wet walk did him physically no harm, and morally some\ngood. He started on it in that frame of mind which induces a man to\nlook with indifference on all coming evils under the impression that the\nevils already come are too heavy to admit of any increase. But by the\ntime that he was thoroughly wet through, well splashed with mud, and\nconsiderably fatigued by his first five or six miles' walk, he began\nto reflect that life was not over with him, and that he must think of\nfuture things as well as those that were past.\n\nHe got home about two o'clock, and having knocked up his landlady, Mrs.\nRichards, betook himself to bed. Alaric had been in his room for the\nlast two hours, but of Charley and his latch-key Mrs. Richards knew\nnothing. She stated her belief, however, that two a.m. seldom saw that\nerratic gentleman in his bed.\n\nOn the following morning, Alaric, when he got his hot water, heard\nthat Norman returned during the night from Hampton, and he immediately\nguessed what had brought him back. He knew that nothing short of some\ngreat trouble would have induced Harry to leave the Cottage so abruptly,\nand that that trouble must have been of such a nature as to make his\nremaining with the Woodwards an aggravation of it. No such trouble could\nhave come on him but the one.\n\nAs Charley seldom made his appearance at the breakfast table on Sunday\nmornings, Alaric foresaw that he must undergo a _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ which\nwould not be agreeable to himself, and which must be much more\ndisagreeable to his companion; but for this there was no help. Harry\nhad, however, prepared himself for what he had to go through, and\nimmediately that the two were alone, he told his tale in a very few\nwords.\n\n'Alaric,' said he, 'I proposed to Gertrude last night, and she refused\nme.'\n\nAlaric Tudor was deeply grieved for his friend. There was something in\nthe rejected suitor's countenance--something in the tone of voice, which\nwould have touched any heart softer than stone; and Alaric's heart had\nnot as yet been so hardened by the world as to render him callous to the\nsight of such grief as this.\n\n'Take my word for it, Harry, she'll think better of it in a month or\ntwo,' he said.\n\n'Never--never; I am sure of it. Not only from her own manner, but from\nher mother's,' said Harry. And yet, during half his walk home, he had\nbeen trying to console himself with the reflection that most young\nladies reject their husbands once or twice before they accept them.\n\nThere is no offering a man comfort in such a sorrow as this; unless,\nindeed, he be one to whom the worship of Bacchus may be made a fitting\nsubstitute for that of the Paphian goddess.\n\nThere is a sort of disgrace often felt, if never acknowledged, which\nattaches itself to a man for having put himself into Norman's present\nposition, and this generally prevents him from confessing his defeat in\nsuch matters. The misfortune in question is one which doubtless occurs\nnot unfrequently to mankind; but as mankind generally bear their special\ndisappointments in silence, and as the vanity of women is generally\nexceeded by their good-nature, the secret, we believe, in most cases\nremains a secret.\n\n  Shall I, wasting in despair,\n  Die because a woman's fair?\n  If she be not fair for me,\n  What care I how fair she be?\n\nThis was the upshot of the consideration which Withers, the poet, gave\nto the matter, and Withers was doubtless right. 'Tis thus that rejected\nlovers should think, thus that they should demean themselves; but they\nseldom come to this philosophy till a few days have passed by, and\ntalking of their grievance does not assist them in doing so.\n\nWhen, therefore, Harry had declared what had happened to him, and had\ndeclared also that he had no further hope, he did not at first find\nhimself much the better for what he had confessed. He was lackadaisical\nand piteous, and Alaric, though he had endeavoured to be friendly, soon\nfound that he had no power of imparting any comfort. Early in the\nday they parted, and did not see each other again till the following\nmorning.\n\n'I was going down to Normansgrove on Thursday,' said Harry.\n\n'Yes, I know,' said Alaric.\n\n'I think I shall ask leave to go to-day. It can't make much difference,\nand the sooner I get away the better.'\n\nAnd so it was settled. Norman left town the same afternoon, and Alaric,\nwith his blushing honours thick upon him, was left alone.\n\nLondon was now very empty, and he was constrained to enjoy his glory\nvery much by himself. He had never associated much with the Minusexes\nand Uppinalls, nor yet with the Joneses and Robinsons of his own\noffice, and it could not be expected that there should be any specially\nconfidential intercourse between them just at the present moment. Undy\nwas of course out of town with the rest of the fashionable world, and\nAlaric, during the next week, was left very much on his own hands.\n\n'And so,' said he to himself, as he walked solitary along the lone paths\nof Rotten Row, and across the huge desert to the Marble Arch, 'and so\npoor Harry's hopes have been all in vain; he has lost his promotion,\nand now he has lost his bride--poor Harry!'--and then it occurred to him\nthat as he had acquired the promotion it might be his destiny to win\nthe bride also. He had never told himself that he loved Gertrude; he had\nlooked on her as Norman's own, and he, at any rate, was not the man to\nsigh in despair after anything that was out of his reach. But now,\nnow that Harry's chance was over, and that no bond of friendship could\ninterfere with such a passion, why should he not tell himself that he\nloved Gertrude? 'If, as Harry had himself said, there was no longer any\nhope for him, why,' said Alaric to himself, 'why should not I try my\nchance?' Of Linda, of 'dear, dearest Linda,' at this moment he thought\nvery little, or, perhaps, not at all. Of what Mrs. Woodward might say,\nof that he did think a good deal.\n\nThe week was melancholy and dull, and it passed very slowly at Hampton.\nOn the Sunday morning it became known to them all that Norman was\ngone, but the subject, by tacit consent, was allowed to pass all but\nunnoticed. Even Katie, even Uncle Bat, were aware that something had\noccurred which ought to prevent them from inquiring too particularly why\nHarry had started back to town in so sudden a manner; and so they said\nnothing. To Linda, Gertrude had told what had happened; and Linda,\nas she heard it, asked herself whether she was prepared to be equally\nobdurate with her lover. He had now the means of supporting a wife, and\nwhy should she be obdurate?\n\nNothing was said on the subject between Gertrude and her mother. What\nmore could Mrs. Woodward say? It would have been totally opposed to the\nwhole principle of her life to endeavour, by any means, to persuade\nher daughter to the match, or to have used her maternal influence\nin Norman's favour. And she was well aware that it would have been\nimpossible to do so successfully. Gertrude was not a girl to be talked\ninto a marriage by any parent, and certainly not by such a parent as her\nmother. There was, therefore, nothing further to be said about it.\n\nOn Saturday Alaric went down, but his arrival hardly made things more\npleasant. Mrs. Woodward could not bring herself to be cordial with him,\nand the girls were restrained by a certain feeling that it would not be\nright to show too much outward joy at Alaric's success. Linda said one\nlittle word of affectionate encouragement, but it produced no apparent\nreturn from Alaric. His immediate object was to recover Mrs. Woodward's\ngood graces; and he thought before he went that he had reason to hope\nthat he might do so.\n\nOf all the household, Captain Cuttwater was the most emphatic in his\ncongratulations. 'He had no doubt,' he said, 'that the best man had won.\nHe had always hoped that the best man might win. He had not had the same\nluck when he was young, but he was very glad to see such an excellent\nrule brought into the service. It would soon work great changes, he was\nquite sure, at the Board of Admiralty.'\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon Captain Cuttwater asked him into his own\nbedroom, and told him with a solemn, serious manner that he had a\ncommunication of importance to make to him. Alaric followed the captain\ninto the well-known room in which Norman used to sleep, wondering what\ncould be the nature of Uncle Bat's important communication. It might,\nprobably, be some tidings of Sir Jib Boom.\n\n'Mr. Alaric,' said the old man, as soon as they were both seated on\nopposite sides of a little Pembroke table that stood in the middle of\nthe room, 'I was heartily glad to hear of your success at the Weights\nand Measures; not that I ever doubted it if they made a fair sailing\nmatch of it.'\n\n'I am sure I am much obliged to you, Captain Cuttwater.'\n\n'That is as may be, by and by. But the fact is, I have taken a fancy to\nyou. I like fellows that know how to push themselves.'\n\nAlaric had nothing for it but to repeat again that he felt himself\ngrateful for Captain Cuttwater's good opinion.\n\n'Not that I have anything to say against Mr. Norman--a very nice young\nman, indeed, he is, very nice, though perhaps not quite so cheerful in\nhis manners as he might be.'\n\nAlaric began to take his friend's part, and declared what a very worthy\nfellow Harry was.\n\n'I am sure of it--I am sure of it,' said Uncle Bat; 'but everybody can't\nbe A 1; and a man can't make everybody his heir.'\n\nAlaric pricked up his ears. So after all Captain Cuttwater was right\nin calling his communication important. But what business had Captain\nCuttwater to talk of making new heirs?--had he not declared that the\nWoodwards were his heirs?\n\n'I have got a little money, Mr. Alaric,' he went on saying in a low\nmodest tone, very different from that he ordinarily used; 'I have got a\nlittle money--not much--and it will of course go to my niece here.'\n\n'Of course,' said Alaric.\n\n'That is to say--it will go to her children, which is all the same\nthing.'\n\n'Quite the same thing,' said Alaric.\n\n'But my idea is this: if a man has saved a few pounds himself, I think\nhe has a right to give it to those he loves best. Now I have no children\nof my own.'\n\nAlaric declared himself aware of the fact.\n\n'And I suppose I shan't have any now.'\n\n'Not if you don't marry,' said Alaric, who felt rather at a loss for a\nproper answer. He could not, however, have made a better one.\n\n'No; that's what I mean; but I don't think I shall marry. I am very well\ncontented here, and I like Surbiton Cottage amazingly.'\n\n'It's a charming place,' said Alaric.\n\n'No, I don't suppose I shall ever have any children of my own,'--and\nthen Uncle Bat sighed gently--'and so I have been considering whom I\nshould like to adopt.'\n\n'Quite right, Captain Cuttwater.'\n\n'Whom I should like to adopt. I should like to have one whom I could\ncall in a special manner my own. Now, Mr. Alaric, I have made up my\nmind, and who do you think it is?'\n\n'Oh! Captain Cuttwater, I couldn't guess on such a matter. I shouldn't\nlike to guess wrong.'\n\n'Perhaps not--no; that's right;--well then, I'll tell you; it's\nGertrude.'\n\nAlaric was well aware that it was Gertrude before her name had been\npronounced.\n\n'Yes, it's Gertrude; of course I couldn't go out of Bessie's family--of\ncourse it must be either Gertrude, or Linda, or Katie. Now Linda and\nKatie are very well, but they haven't half the gumption that Gertrude\nhas.'\n\n'No, they have not,' said Alaric.\n\n'I like gumption,' said Captain Cuttwater. 'You've a great deal of\ngumption--that's why I like you.'\n\nAlaric laughed, and muttered something.\n\n'Now I have been thinking of something;' and Uncle Bat looked strangely\nmysterious--'I wonder what you think of Gertrude?'\n\n'Who--I?' said Alaric.\n\n'I can see through a millstone as well as another,' said the captain;\n'and I used to think that Norman and Gertrude meant to hit it off\ntogether.'\n\nAlaric said nothing. He did not feel inclined to tell Norman's secret,\nand yet he could not belie Gertrude by contradicting the justice of\nCaptain Cuttwater's opinion.\n\n'I used to think so--but now I find there's nothing in it. I am sure\nGertrude wouldn't have him, and I think she's right. He hasn't gumption\nenough.'\n\n'Harry Norman is no fool.'\n\n'I dare say not,' said the captain; 'but take my word, she'll never have\nhim--Lord bless you, Norman knows that as well as I do.'\n\nAlaric knew it very well himself also; but he did not say so.\n\n'Now, the long and the short of it is this--why don't you make up to\nher? If you'll make up to her and carry the day, all I can say is, I\nwill do all I can to keep the pot a-boiling; and if you think it will\nhelp you, you may tell Gertrude that I say so.'\n\nThis was certainly an important communication, and one to which Alaric\nfound it very difficult to give any immediate answer. He said a great\ndeal about his affection for Mrs. Woodward, of his admiration for Miss\nWoodward, of his strong sense of Captain Cuttwater's kindness, and of\nhis own unworthiness; but he left the captain with an impression that\nhe was not prepared at the present moment to put himself forward as a\ncandidate for Gertrude's hand.\n\n'I don't know what the deuce he would have,' said the captain to\nhimself. 'She's as fine a girl as he's likely to find; and two or three\nthousand pounds isn't so easily got every day by a fellow that hasn't a\nshilling of his own.'\n\nWhen Alaric took his departure the next morning, he thought he\nperceived, from Mrs. Woodward's manner, that there was less than her\nusual cordiality in the tone in which she said that of course he would\nreturn at the end of the week.\n\n'I will if possible,' he said, 'and I need not say that I hope to do so;\nbut I fear I may be kept in town--at any rate I'll write.' When the end\nof the week came he wrote to say that unfortunately he was kept in town.\nHe thoroughly understood that people are most valued when they make\nthemselves scarce. He got in reply a note from Gertrude, saying that\nher mother begged that on the following Saturday he would come and bring\nCharley with him.\n\nOn his return to town, Alaric, by appointment, called on Sir Gregory.\nHe had not seen his patron yet since his great report on Wheal Mary Jane\nhad been sent in. That report had been written exclusively by himself,\nand poor Neverbend had been obliged to content himself with putting all\nhis voluminous notes into Tudor's hands. He afterwards obediently signed\nthe report, and received his reward for doing so. Alaric never divulged\nto official ears how Neverbend had halted in the course of his descent\nto the infernal gods.\n\n'I thoroughly congratulate you,' said Sir Gregory. 'You have justified\nmy choice, and done your duty with credit to yourself and benefit to the\npublic. I hope you may go on and prosper. As long as you remember that\nyour own interests should always be kept in subservience to those of\nthe public service, you will not fail to receive the praise which such\nconduct deserves.'\n\nAlaric thanked Sir Gregory for his good opinion, and as he did so, he\nthought of his new banker's account, and of the \u00c2\u00a3300 which was lying\nthere. After all, which of them was right, Sir Gregory Hardlines or Undy\nScott? Or was it that Sir Gregory's opinions were such as should control\nthe outward conduct, and Undy's those which should rule the inner man?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nVERY SAD\n\n\nNorman prolonged his visit to his father considerably beyond the month.\nAt first he applied for and received permission to stay away another\nfortnight, and at the end of that fortnight he sent up a medical\ncertificate in which the doctor alleged that he would be unable to\nattend to business for some considerable additional period. It was not\ntill after Christmas Day that he reappeared at the Weights and Measures.\n\nAlaric kept his appointment at Hampton, and took Charley with him. And\non the two following Saturdays he also went there, and on both occasions\nCharley accompanied him. During these visits, he devoted himself, as\nclosely as he could, to Mrs. Woodward. He talked to her of Norman, and\nof Norman's prospects in the office; he told her how he had intended to\nabstain from offering himself as a competitor, till he had, as it were,\nbeen forced by Norman to do so; he declared over and over again that\nNorman would have been victorious had he stood his ground to the end,\nand assured her that such was the general opinion through the whole\nestablishment. And this he did without talking much about himself, or\npraising himself in any way when he did so. His speech was wholly of his\nfriend, and of the sorrow that he felt that his friend should have been\ndisappointed in his hopes.\n\nAll this had its effects. Of Norman's rejected love they neither of them\nspoke. Each knew that the other must be aware of it, but the subject was\nfar too tender to be touched, at any rate as yet. And so matters went\non, and Alaric regained the footing of favour which he had for a while\nlost with the mistress of the house.\n\nBut there was one inmate of Surbiton Cottage who saw that though Alaric\nspent so much of his time with Mrs. Woodward, he found opportunity also\nfor other private conversation; and this was Linda. Why was it that in\nthe moments before they dressed for dinner Alaric was whispering with\nGertrude, and not with her? Why was it that Alaric had felt it necessary\nto stay from church that Sunday evening when Gertrude also had been\nprevented from going by a headache? He had remained, he said, in order\nthat Captain Cuttwater might have company; but Linda was not slow to\nlearn that Uncle Bat had been left to doze away the time by himself.\nWhy, on the following Monday, had Gertrude been down so early, and why\nhad Alaric been over from the inn full half an hour before his usual\ntime? Linda saw and knew all this, and was disgusted. But even then she\ndid not, could not think that Alaric could be untrue to her; that her\nown sister would rob her of her lover. It could not be that there should\nbe such baseness in human nature!\n\nPoor Linda!\n\nAnd yet, though she did not believe that such falseness could exist in\nthis world of hers at Surbiton Cottage, she could not restrain herself\nfrom complaining rather petulantly to her sister, as they were going to\nbed on that Sunday evening.\n\n'I hope your headache is better,' she said, in a tone of voice as near\nto irony as her soft nature could produce.\n\n'Yes, it is quite well now,' said Gertrude, disdaining to notice the\nirony.\n\n'I dare say Alaric had a headache too. I suppose one was about as bad as\nthe other.'\n\n'Linda,' said Gertrude, answering rather with dignity than with anger,\n'you ought to know by this time that it is not likely that I should\nplead false excuses. Alaric never said he had a headache.'\n\n'He said he stayed from church to be with Uncle Bat; but when we came\nback we found him with you.'\n\n'Uncle Bat went to sleep, and then he came into the drawing-room.'\n\nThe two girls said nothing more about it. Linda should have remembered\nthat she had never breathed a word to her sister of Alaric's passion for\nherself. Gertrude's solemn propriety had deterred her, just as she was\nabout to do so. How very little of that passion had Alaric breathed\nhimself! and yet, alas! enough to fill the fond girl's heart with dreams\nof love, which occupied all her waking, all her sleeping thoughts.\nOh! ye ruthless swains, from whose unhallowed lips fall words full of\npoisoned honey, do ye never think of the bitter agony of many months,\nof the dull misery of many years, of the cold monotony of an uncheered\nlife, which follow so often as the consequence of your short hour of\npastime?\n\nOn the Monday morning, as soon as Alaric and Charley had started for\ntown--it was the morning on which Linda had been provoked to find that\nboth Gertrude and Alaric had been up half an hour before they should\nhave been--Gertrude followed her mother to her dressing-room, and with\npalpitating heart closed the door behind her.\n\nLinda remained downstairs, putting away her tea and sugar, not in the\nbest of humours; but Katie, according to her wont, ran up after her\nmother.\n\n'Katie,' said Gertrude, as Katie bounced into the room, 'dearest Katie,\nI want to speak a word to mamma--alone. Will you mind going down just\nfor a few minutes?' and she put her arm round her sister, and kissed her\nwith almost unwonted tenderness.\n\n'Go, Katie, dear,' said Mrs. Woodward; and Katie, speechless, retired.\n\n'Gertrude has got something particular to tell mamma; something that\nI may not hear. I wonder what it is about,' said Katie to her second\nsister.\n\nLinda's heart sank within her. 'Could it be? No, it could not, could\nnot be, that the sweet voice which had whispered in her ears those\nwell-remembered words, could have again whispered the same into other\nears--that the very Gertrude who had warned her not to listen to such\nwords from such lips, should have listened to them herself, and have\nadopted them and made them her own! It could not, could not be!' and yet\nLinda's heart sank low within her.\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n'If you really love him,' said the mother, again caressing her eldest\ndaughter as she acknowledged her love, but hardly with such tenderness\nas when that daughter had repudiated that other love--'if you really\nlove him, dearest, of course I do not, of course I cannot, object.'\n\n'I do, mamma; I do.'\n\n'Well, then, Gertrude, so be it. I have not a word to say against your\nchoice. Had I not believed him to be an excellent young man, I should\nnot have allowed him to be here with you so much as he has been. We\ncannot all see with the same eyes, dearest, can we?'\n\n'No, mamma; but pray don't think I dislike poor Harry; and, oh! mamma,\npray don't set him against Alaric because of this----'\n\n'Set him against Alaric! No, Gertrude. I certainly shall not do that.\nBut whether I can reconcile Harry to it, that is another thing.'\n\n'At any rate he has no right to be angry at it,' said Gertrude, assuming\nher air of dignity.\n\n'Certainly not with you, Gertrude.'\n\n'No, nor with Alaric,' said she, almost with indignation.\n\n'That depends on what has passed between them. It is very hard to say\nhow men so situated regard each other.'\n\n'I know everything that has passed between them,' said Gertrude. 'I\nnever gave Harry any encouragement. As soon as I understood my own\nfeelings I endeavoured to make him understand them also.'\n\n'But, my dearest, no one is blaming you.'\n\n'But you are blaming Alaric.'\n\n'Indeed I am not, Gertrude.'\n\n'No man could have behaved more honourably to his friend,' said\nGertrude; 'no man more nobly; and if Harry does not feel it so, he has\nnot the good heart for which I always gave him credit.'\n\n'Poor fellow! his friendship for Alaric will be greatly tried.'\n\n'And, mamma, has not Alaric's friendship been tried? and has it not\nborne the trial nobly? Harry told him of--of--of his intentions; Harry\ntold him long, long, long ago----'\n\n'Ah me!--poor Harry!' sighed Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'But you think nothing of Alaric!'\n\n'Alaric is successful, my dear, and can----' Think sufficiently of\nhimself, Mrs. Woodward was going to say, but she stopped herself.\n\n'Harry told him all,' continued Gertrude, 'and Alaric--Alaric said\nnothing of his own feelings. Alaric never said a word to me that he\nmight not have said before his friend--till--till--You must own, mamma,\nthat no one can have behaved more nobly than Alaric has done.'\n\nMrs. Woodward, nevertheless, had her own sentiments on the matter, which\nwere not quite in unison with those of her daughter. But then she was\nnot in love with Alaric, and her daughter was. She thought that Alaric's\nlove was a passion that had but lately come to the birth, and that had\nhe been true to his friend--nobly true as Gertrude had described him--it\nwould never have been born at all, or at any rate not till Harry had had\na more prolonged chance of being successful with his suit. Mrs.\nWoodward understood human nature better than her daughter, or, at least,\nflattered herself that she did so, and she felt well assured that Alaric\nhad not been dying for love during the period of Harry's unsuccessful\ncourtship. He might, she thought, have waited a little longer before he\nchose for his wife the girl whom his friend had loved, seeing that he\nhad been made the confidant of that love.\n\nSuch were the feelings which Mrs. Woodward felt herself unable to\nrepress; but she could not refuse her consent to the marriage. After\nall, she had some slight twinge of conscience, some inward conviction\nthat she was prejudiced in Harry's favour, as her daughter was in\nAlaric's. Then she had lost all right to object to Alaric, by allowing\nhim to be so constantly at the Cottage; and then again, there was\nnothing to which in reason she could object. In point of immediate\nincome, Alaric was now the better match of the two. She kissed her\ndaughter, therefore, and promised that she would do her best to take\nAlaric to her heart as her son-in-law.\n\n'You will tell Uncle Bat, mamma?' said Gertrude.\n\n'O yes--certainly, my dear; of course he'll be told. But I suppose it\ndoes not make much matter, immediately?'\n\n'I think he should be told, mamma; I should not like him to think that\nhe was treated with anything like disrespect.'\n\n'Very well, my dear, I'll tell him,' said Mrs. Woodward, who was\nsomewhat surprised at her daughter's punctilious feelings about Uncle\nBat. However, it was all very proper; and she was glad to think that her\nchildren were inclined to treat their grand-uncle with respect, in spite\nof his long nose.\n\nAnd then Gertrude was preparing to leave the room, but her mother\nstopped her. 'Gertrude, dear,' said she.\n\n'Yes, mamma.'\n\n'Come here, dearest; shut the door. Gertrude, have you told Linda yet?'\n\n'No, mamma, not yet.'\n\nAs Mrs. Woodward asked the question, there was an indescribable look of\npainful emotion on her brow. It did not escape Gertrude's eye, and was\nnot to her perfectly unintelligible. She had conceived an idea--why, she\ndid not know--that these recent tidings of hers would not be altogether\nagreeable to her sister.\n\n'No, mamma, I have not told her; of course I told you first. But now I\nshall do so immediately.'\n\n'Let me tell her,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'will you, Gertrude?'\n\n'Oh! certainly, mamma, if you wish it.'\n\nThings were going wrong with Mrs. Woodward. She had perceived, with a\nmother's anxious eye, that her second daughter was not indifferent to\nAlaric Tudor. While she yet thought that Norman and Gertrude would have\nsuited each other, this had caused her no disquietude. She herself\nhad entertained none of those grand ideas to which Gertrude had given\nutterance with so much sententiousness, when she silenced Linda's tale\nof love before the telling of it had been commenced. Mrs. Woodward had\nalways felt sufficiently confident that Alaric would push himself in the\nworld, and she would have made no objection to him as a son-in-law had\nhe been contented to take the second instead of the first of her flock.\n\nShe had never spoken to Linda on the matter, and Linda had offered to\nher no confidence; but she felt all but sure that her second child would\nnot have entertained the affection which she had been unable altogether\nto conceal, had no lover's plea been poured into her ears. Mrs. Woodward\nquestioned her daughters but little, but she understood well the nature\nof each, and could nearly read their thoughts. Linda's thoughts it was\nnot difficult to read.\n\n'Linda, pet,' she said, as soon as she could get Linda into her room\nwithout absolutely sending for her, 'you have not yet heard Gertrude's\nnews?'\n\n'No,' said Linda, turning very pale, and feeling that her heart was like\nto burst.\n\n'I would let no one tell you but myself, Linda. Come here, dearest;\ndon't stand there away from me. Can you guess what it is?'\n\nLinda, for a moment, could not speak. 'No, mamma,' she said at last, 'I\ndon't know what it is.'\n\nMrs. Woodward twined her arm round her daughter's waist, as they sat on\nthe sofa close to each other. Linda tried to compose herself, but she\nfelt that she was trembling in her mother's arms. She would have given\nanything to be calm; anything to hide her secret. She little guessed\nthen how well her mother knew it. Her eyes were turned down, and she\nfound that she could not raise them to her mother's face.\n\n'No, mamma,' she said. 'I don't know--what is it?'\n\n'Gertrude is to be married, Linda. She is engaged.'\n\n'I thought she refused Harry,' said Linda, through whose mind a faint\nidea was passing of the cruelty of nature's arrangements, which gave all\nthe lovers to her sister.\n\n'Yes, dearest, she did; and now another has made an offer--she has\naccepted him.' Mrs. Woodward could hardly bring herself to speak out\nthat which she had to say, and yet she felt that she was only prolonging\nthe torture for which she was so anxious to find a remedy.\n\n'Has she?' said Linda, on whom the full certainty of her misery had now\nall but come.\n\n'She has accepted our dear Alaric.'\n\nOur dear Alaric! what words for Linda's ears! They did reach her ears,\nbut they did not dwell there--her soft gentle nature sank beneath the\nsound. Her mother, when she looked to her for a reply, found that she\nwas sinking through her arms. Linda had fainted.\n\nMrs. Woodward neither screamed, nor rang for assistance, nor emptied the\nwater-jug over her daughter, nor did anything else which would have\nthe effect of revealing to the whole household the fact that Linda had\nfainted. She had seen girls faint before, and was not frightened. But\nhow, when Linda recovered, was she to be comforted?\n\nMrs. Woodward laid her gently on the sofa, undid her dress, loosened her\nstays, and then sat by her chafing her hands, and moistening her lips\nand temples, till gradually the poor girl's eyes re-opened. The\nrecovery from a fainting fit, a real fainting fit I beg young ladies\nto understand, brings with it a most unpleasant sensation, and for\nsome minutes Linda's sorrow was quelled by her sufferings; but as\nshe recovered her strength she remembered where she was and what had\nhappened, and sobbing violently she burst into an hysterical storm of\ntears.\n\nHer most poignant feeling now was one of fear lest her mother should\nhave guessed her secret; and this Mrs. Woodward well understood. She\ncould do nothing towards comforting her child till there was perfect\nconfidence between them. It was easy to arrive at this with Linda, nor\nwould it afterwards be difficult to persuade her as to the course she\nought to take. The two girls were so essentially different; the one so\neager to stand alone and guide herself, the other so prone to lean on\nthe nearest support that came to her hand.\n\nIt was not long before Linda had told her mother everything. Either by\nwords, or tears, or little signs of mute confession, she made her mother\nunderstand, with all but exactness, what had passed between Alaric and\nherself, and quite exactly what had been the state of her own heart. She\nsobbed, and wept, and looked up to her mother for forgiveness as though\nshe had been guilty of a great sin; and when her mother caressed her\nwith all a mother's tenderness, and told her that she was absolved from\nall fault, free of all blame, she was to a certain degree comforted.\nWhatever might now happen, her mother would be on her side. But Mrs.\nWoodward, when she looked into the matter, found that it was she that\nshould have demanded pardon of her daughter, not her daughter of her!\nWhy had this tender lamb been allowed to wander out of the fold, while a\nwolf in sheep's clothing was invited into the pasture-ground?\n\nGertrude, with her talent, her beauty, and dignity of demeanour, had\nhitherto been, perhaps, the closest to the mother's heart--had been, if\nnot the most cherished, yet the most valued; Gertrude had been the apple\nof her eye. This should be altered now. If a mother's love could atone\nfor a mother's negligence, Mrs. Woodward would atone to her child for\nthis hour of misery! And Katie--her sweet bonny Katie--she, at least,\nshould be protected from the wolves. Those were the thoughts that passed\nthrough Mrs. Woodward's heart as she sat there caressing Linda. But how\nwere things to be managed now at the present moment? It was quite clear\nthat the wolf in sheep's clothing must be admitted into the pastoral\nfamily; either that, or the fairest lamb of the flock must be turned\nout altogether, to take upon herself lupine nature, and roam the woods a\nbeast of prey. As matters stood it behoved them to make such a sheep of\nAlaric as might be found practicable.\n\nAnd so Mrs. Woodward set to work to teach her daughter how best she\nmight conduct herself in her present state of wretchedness. She had to\nbear with her sister's success, to listen to her sister's joy, to enter\ninto all her future plans, to assist at her toilet, to prepare her\nwedding garments, to hear the congratulations of friends, and take a\nsister's share in a sister's triumph, and to do this without once\ngiving vent to a reproach. And she had worse than this to do; she had to\nencounter Alaric, and to wish him joy of his bride; she had to protect\nher female pride from the disgrace which a hopeless but acknowledged\nlove would throw on it; she had to live in the house with Alaric as\nthough he were her brother, and as though she had never thought to live\nwith him in any nearer tie. She would have to stand at the altar as her\nsister's bridesmaid, and see them married, and she would have to smile\nand be cheerful as she did so.\n\nThis was the lesson which Mrs. Woodward had now to teach her daughter;\nand she so taught it that Linda did all that circumstances and her\nmother required of her. Late on that afternoon she went to Gertrude,\nand, kissing her, wished her joy. At that moment Gertrude was the more\nembarrassed of the two.\n\n'Linda, dear Linda,' she said, embracing her sister convulsively.\n\n'I hope you will be happy, Gertrude, with all my heart,' said Linda; and\nso she relinquished her lover.\n\nWe talk about the weakness of women--and Linda Woodward was, in many a\nway, weak enough--but what man, what giant, has strength equal to this?\nIt was not that her love was feeble. Her heart was capable of truest\nlove, and she had loved Alaric truly. But she had that within her which\nenabled her to overcome herself, and put her own heart, and hopes, and\nhappiness--all but her maiden pride--into the background, when the hopes\nand happiness of another required it.\n\nShe still shared the same room with her sister; and those who know\nhow completely absorbed a girl is by her first acknowledged love, may\nimagine how many questions she had to answer, to how many propositions\nshe was called to assent, for how many schemes she had to vouchsafe a\nsister's interest, while her heart was telling her that she should have\nbeen the questioner, she should have been the proposer, that the schemes\nshould all have been her own.\n\nBut she bore it bravely. When Alaric first came down, which he did in\nthe middle of the week, she was, as she told her mother, too weak to\nstand in his presence. Her mother strongly advised her not to absent\nherself; so she sat gently by, while he kissed Mrs. Woodward and Katie.\nShe sat and trembled, for her turn she knew must come. It did come;\nAlaric, with an assurance which told more for his courage than for his\nheart, came up to her, and with a smiling face offered her his hand. She\nrose up and muttered some words which she had prepared for the occasion,\nand he, still holding her by the hand, stooped down and kissed her\ncheek. Mrs. Woodward looked on with an angry flush on her brow, and\nhated him for his cold-hearted propriety of demeanour.\n\nLinda went up to her mother's room, and, sitting on her mother's bed,\nsobbed herself into tranquillity.\n\nIt was very grievous to Mrs. Woodward to have to welcome Alaric to her\nhouse. For Alaric's own sake she would no longer have troubled herself\nto do so; but Gertrude was still her daughter, her dear child. Gertrude\nhad done nothing to disentitle her to a child's part, and a child's\nprotection; and even had she done so, Mrs. Woodward was not a woman to\nbe unforgiving to her child. For Gertrude's sake she had to make Alaric\nwelcome; she forced herself to smile on him and call him her son; to\nmake him more at home in her house even than Harry had ever been; to\ngive him privileges which he, wolf as he was, had so little deserved.\n\nBut Captain Cuttwater made up by the warmth of his congratulations for\nany involuntary coolness which Alaric might have detected in those of\nMrs. Woodward. It had become a strong wish of the old man's heart that\nhe might make Alaric, at any rate in part, his heir, without doing an\ninjustice to his niece or her family. He had soon seen and appreciated\nwhat he had called the 'gumption' both of Gertrude and Alaric. Had Harry\nmarried Gertrude, and Alaric Linda, he would have regarded either of\nthose matches with disfavour. But now he was quite satisfied--now he\ncould look on Alaric as his son and Gertrude as his daughter, and use\nhis money according to his fancy, without incurring the reproaches of\nhis conscience.\n\n'Quite right, my boy, 'he said to Alaric, slapping him on the back at\nthe same time with pretty nearly all his power--'quite right. Didn't I\nknow you were the winning horse?--didn't I tell you how it would be?\nDo you think I don't know what gumption means? If I had not had my\nown weather-eye open, aye, and d---- wide open, the most of my time,\nI shouldn't have two or three thousand pounds to give away now to any\nyoung fellow that I take a fancy to.'\n\nAlaric was, of course, all smiles and good humour, and Gertrude not less\nso. The day after he heard of the engagement Uncle Bat went to town,\nand, on his return, he gave Gertrude \u00c2\u00a3100 to buy her wedding-clothes,\nand half that sum to her mother, in order that the thing might go off,\nas he expressed himself, 'slip-slap, and no mistake.' To Linda he gave\nnothing, but promised her that he would not forget her when her time\ncame.\n\nAll this time Norman was at Normansgrove; but there were three of the\nparty who felt that it behoved them to let him know what was going on.\nMrs. Woodward wrote first, and on the following day both Gertrude and\nAlaric wrote to him, the former from Hampton, and the latter from his\noffice in London.\n\nAll these letters were much laboured, but, with all this labour, not one\nof them contained within it a grain of comfort. That from Mrs.\nWoodward came first and told the tale. Strange to say, though Harry had\nstudiously rejected from his mind all idea of hope as regarded Gertrude,\nnevertheless the first tidings of her betrothal with Alaric struck him\nas though he had still fancied himself a favoured lover. He felt as\nthough, in his absence, he had been robbed of a prize which was all his\nown, as though a chattel had been taken from him to which he had a full\nright; as though all the Hampton party, Mrs. Woodward included, were in\na conspiracy to defraud him the moment his back was turned.\n\nThe blow was so severe that it laid him prostrate at once. He could not\nsob away his sorrow on his mother's bosom; no one could teach him how to\nbear his grief with meek resignation. He had never spoken of his love\nto his friends at Normansgrove. They had all been witnesses to his\ndeep disappointment, but that had been attributed to his failure at\nhis office. He was not a man to seek for sympathy in the sorrows of his\nheart. He had told Alaric of his rejection, because he had already told\nhim of his love, but he had whispered no word of it to anyone besides.\nOn the day on which he received Mrs. Woodward's letter, he appeared at\ndinner ghastly pale, and evidently so ill as to be all but unable to sit\nat table; but he would say nothing to anybody; he sat brooding over his\ngrief till he was unable to sit any longer.\n\nAnd yet Mrs. Woodward had written with all her skill, with all her\nheart striving to pluck the sting away from the tidings which she had to\ncommunicate. She had felt, however, that she owed as much, at least, to\nher daughter as she did to him, and she failed to call Alaric perjured,\nfalse, dishonoured, unjust, disgraced, and treacherous. Nothing short of\nher doing so would have been deemed by Norman fitting mention of Tudor's\nsin; nothing else would have satisfied the fury of his wrath.\n\nOn the next morning he received Gertrude's letter and Alaric's. The\nlatter he never read--he opened it, saw that it began as usual, 'My dear\nHarry,' and then crammed it into his pocket. By return of post it\nwent back under a blank cover, addressed to Alaric at the Weights and\nMeasures. The days of duelling were gone by--unfortunately, as Norman\nnow thought, but nothing, he determined, should ever induce him again to\nhold friendly intercourse with the traitor. He abstained from making any\nsuch oath as to the Woodwards; but determined that his conduct in that\nrespect should be governed by the manner in which Alaric was received by\nthem.\n\nBut Gertrude's letter he read over and over again, and each time he\ndid so he indulged in a fresh burst of hatred against the man who had\ndeceived him. 'A dishonest villain!' he said to himself over and over\nagain; 'what right had I to suppose he would be true to me when I found\nthat he had been so false to others?'\n\n'Dearest Harry,' the letter began. Dearest Harry!--Why should she begin\nwith a lie? He was not dearest! 'You must not, must not, must not be\nangry with Alaric,' she went on to say, as soon as she had told her\ntale. Oh, must he not? Not be angry with Alaric! Not angry with the man\nwho had forgotten every law of honour, every principle of honesty, every\ntie of friendship! Not angry with the man whom he had trusted with the\nkey of his treasure, and who had then robbed him; who had stolen from\nhim all his contentment, all his joy, his very heart's blood; not angry\nwith him!\n\n'Our happiness will never be perfect unless you will consent to share\nit.' Thus simply, in the affection of her heart, had Gertrude concluded\nthe letter by which she intended to pour balm into the wounds of her\nrejected lover, and pave the way for the smoothing of such difficulties\nas might still lie in the way of her love.\n\n'Their happiness would not be perfect unless he would consent to share\nit.' Every word in the sentence was gall to him. It must have been\nwritten with the object of lacerating his wounds, and torturing his\nspirit; so at least said Norman to himself. He read the letter over and\nover again. At one time he resolved to keep it till he could thrust\nit back into her hand, and prove to her of what cruelty she had been\nguilty. Then he thought of sending it to Mrs. Woodward, and asking her\nhow, after that, could she think that he should ever again enter her\ndoors at Hampton. Finally he tore it into a thousand bits, and threw\nthem behind the fire.\n\n'Share their happiness!' and as he repeated the words he gave the last\ntear to the fragments of paper which he still held in his hand. Could\nhe at that moment as easily have torn to shreds all hope of earthly joys\nfor those two lovers, he would then have done it, and cast the ruins to\nthe flames.\n\nOh! what a lesson he might have learnt from Linda! And yet what were his\ninjuries to hers? He in fact had not been injured, at least not by him\nagainst whom the strength of his wrath most fiercely raged. The two men\nhad both admired Gertrude, but Norman had started on the race first.\nBefore Alaric had had time to know his own mind, he had learnt that\nNorman claimed the beauty as his own. He had acknowledged to himself\nthat Norman had a right to do so, and had scrupulously abstained from\ninterfering with him. Why should Norman, like a dog in the manger,\nbegrudge to his friend the fodder which he himself could not enjoy?\nTo him, at any rate, Alaric had in this been no traitor. 'Twas thus\nat least that Gertrude argued in her heart, and 'twas thus that Mrs.\nWoodward tried to argue also.\n\nBut who could excuse Alaric's falseness to Linda? And yet Linda had\nforgiven him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nNORMAN RETURNS TO TOWN\n\n\nHarry Norman made no answer to either of his three letters beyond that\nof sending Alaric's back unread; but this, without other reply, was\nsufficient to let them all guess, nearly with accuracy, what was\nthe state of his mind. Alaric told Gertrude how his missive had been\ntreated, and Gertrude, of course, told her mother.\n\nThere was very little of that joy at Surbiton Cottage which should\nhave been the forerunner of a wedding. None of the Woodward circle were\ncontent thus to lose their friend. And then their unhappiness on\nthis score was augmented by hearing that Harry had sent up a medical\ncertificate, instead of returning to his duties when his prolonged leave\nof absence was expired.\n\nTo Alaric this, at the moment, was a relief. He had dreaded the return\nof Norman to London. There were so many things to cause infinite pain\nto them both. All Norman's things, his books and clothes, his desks\nand papers and pictures, his whips and sticks, and all those sundry\nbelongings which even a bachelor collects around him--were strewing the\nrooms in which Alaric still lived. He had of course felt that it was\nimpossible that they should ever again reside together. Not only must\nthey quarrel, but all the men at their office must know that they had\nquarrelled. And yet some intercourse must be maintained between them;\nthey must daily meet in the rooms at the Weights and Measures; and it\nwould now in their altered position become necessary that in some things\nNorman should receive instructions from Alaric as his superior officer.\nBut if Alaric thought of this often, so did Norman; and before the last\nfortnight had expired, the thinking of it had made him so ill that his\nimmediate return to London was out of the question.\n\nMrs. Woodward's heart melted within her when she heard that Harry was\nreally ill. She had gone on waiting day after day for an answer to her\nletter, but no answer came. No answer came, but in lieu thereof she\nheard that Harry was laid up at Normansgrove. She heard it, and Gertrude\nheard it, and in spite of the coming wedding there was very little joy\nat Surbiton Cottage.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Woodward wrote again; and a man must have had a heart of\nstone not to be moved by such a letter. She had 'heard,' she said, 'that\nhe was ill, and the tidings had made her wretched--the more so inasmuch\nas he had sent no answer to her last letter. Was he very ill? was he\ndangerously ill? She hoped, she would fain hope, that his illness had\nnot arisen from any mental grief. If he did not reply to this, or get\nsome of his family to do so, there would be nothing for her but to go,\nherself, to Normansgrove. She could not remain quiet while she was left\nin such painful doubt about her dearest, well-loved Harry Norman.' How\nto speak of Gertrude, or how not to speak of her, Mrs. Woodward knew\nnot--at last she added: 'The three girls send their kindest love; they\nare all as wretchedly anxious as I am. I know you are too good to wish\nthat poor Gertrude should suffer, but, if you did, you might have your\nwish. The tidings of your illness, together with your silence, have\nrobbed her of all her happiness;' and it ended thus:--'Dearest Harry! do\nnot be cruel to us; our hearts are all with you.'\n\nThis was too much for Norman's sternness; and he relented, at least as\nfar as Mrs. Woodward was concerned. He wrote to say that though he was\nstill weak, he was not dangerously ill; and that he intended, if nothing\noccurred amiss, to be in town about the end of the year. He hoped\nhe might then see her to thank her for all her kindness. She would\nunderstand that he could not go down to Surbiton Cottage; but as she\nwould doubtless have some occasion for coming up to town, they might\nthus contrive to meet. He then sent his love to Linda and Katie, and\nended by saying that he had written to Charley Tudor to take lodgings\nfor him. Not the slightest allusion was made either to Gertrude or\nAlaric, except that which might seem to be conveyed in the intimation\nthat he could make no more visits to Hampton.\n\nThis letter was very cold. It just permitted Mrs. Woodward to know that\nNorman did not regard them all as strangers; and that was all. Linda\nsaid it was very sad; and Gertrude said, not to her mother but to\nAlaric, that it was heartless. Captain Cuttwater predicted that he would\nsoon come round, and be as sound as a roach again in six months' time.\nAlaric said nothing; but he went on with his wooing, and this he did\nso successfully, as to make Gertrude painfully alive to what would have\nbeen, in her eyes, the inferiority of her lot, had she unfortunately\nallowed herself to become the victim of Norman's love.\n\nAlaric went on with his wooing, and he also went on with his\nshare-buying. Undy Scott had returned to town for a week or two to\nwind up the affairs of his expiring secretaryship, and he made Alaric\nunderstand that a nice thing might yet be done in Mary Janes. Alaric\nhad been very foolish to sell so quickly; so at least said Undy. To this\nAlaric replied that he had bought the shares thoughtlessly, and had felt\na desire to get rid of them as quickly as he could. Those were scruples\nat which Undy laughed pleasantly, and Alaric soon laughed with him.\n\n'At any rate,' said Undy, 'your report is written, and off your hands\nnow: so you may do what you please in the matter, like a free man, with\na safe conscience.'\n\nAlaric supposed that he might.\n\n'I am as fond of the Civil Service as any man,' said Undy; 'just as fond\nof it as Sir Gregory himself. I have been in it, and may be in it again.\nIf I do, I shall do my duty. But I have no idea of having my hands tied.\nMy purse is my own, to do what I like with it. Whether I buy beef or\nmutton, or shares in Cornwall, is nothing to anyone. I give the Crown\nwhat it pays for, my five or six hours a day, and nothing more. When I\nwas appointed private secretary to the First Lord of the Stannaries, I\ntold my friend Whip Vigil that those were the terms on which I accepted\noffice; and Vigil agreed with me.' Alaric, pupil as he was to the great\nSir Gregory, declared that he also agreed with him. 'That is not Sir\nGregory's doctrine, but it's mine,' said Undy; 'and though it's my own,\nI think it by far the honester doctrine of the two.'\n\nAlaric did not sift the matter very deeply, nor did he ask Undy, or\nhimself either, whether in using the contents of his purse in the\npurchase of shares he would be justified in turning to his own purpose\nany information which he might obtain in his official career. Nor did\nhe again offer to put that broad test to himself which he had before\nproposed, and ask himself whether he would dare to talk of what he was\ndoing in the face of day, in his own office, before Sir Gregory,\nor before the Neverbends of the Service. He had already learnt the\nabsurdity of such tests. Did other men talk of such doings? Was it not\nnotorious that the world speculated, and that the world was generally\nsilent in the matter? Why should he attempt to be wiser than those\naround him? Was it not sufficient for him to be wise in his generation?\nWhat man had ever become great, who allowed himself to be impeded by\nsmall scruples? If the sportsman returned from the field laden with\ngame, who would scrutinize the mud on his gaiters? 'Excelsior!' said\nAlaric to himself with a proud ambition; and so he attempted to rise by\nthe purchase and sale of mining shares.\n\nWhen he was fairly engaged in the sport, his style of play so fascinated\nUndy that they embarked in a sort of partnership, _pro hoc vice_, good\nto the last during the ups and downs of Wheal Mary Jane. Mary Jane, no\ndoubt, would soon run dry, or else be drowned, as had happened to New\nFriendship. But in the meantime something might be done.\n\n'Of course you'll be consulted about those other papers,' said Undy. 'It\nmight be as well they should be kept back for a week or two.'\n\n'Well, I'll see,' said Alaric; and as he said it, he felt that his face\nwas tinged with a blush of shame. But what then? Who would look at the\ndirt on his gaiters, if he filled his bag with game?\n\nMrs. Woodward was no whit angered by the coldness of Norman's letter.\nShe wished that he could have brought himself to write in a different\nstyle, but she remembered his grief, and knew that as time should\nwork its cure upon it, he would come round and again be gentle and\naffectionate, at any rate with her.\n\nShe misdoubted Charley's judgement in the choice of lodgings, and\ntherefore she talked over the matter with Alaric. It was at last decided\nthat he, Alaric, should move instead of driving Norman away. His final\nmovement would soon take place; that movement which would rob him of\nthe freedom of lodginghood, and invest him with all the ponderous\nresponsibility and close restraint of a householder. He and Gertrude\nwere to be married in February, and after spending a cold honeymoon in\nParis and Brussels, were to begin their married life amidst the sharp\nwinds of a London March. But love, gratified love, will, we believe,\nkeep out even an English east wind. If so, it is certainly the only\nthing that will.\n\nCharley, therefore, wrote to Norman, telling him that he could remain in\nhis old home, and humbly asking permission to remain there with him.\nTo this request he received a kind rejoinder in the affirmative. Though\nCharley was related to Alaric, there had always apparently been a closer\nfriendship between him and Norman than between the two cousins; and now,\nin his fierce unbridled quarrel with Alaric, and in his present coolness\nwith the Woodwards, he seemed to turn to Charley with more than ordinary\naffection.\n\nNorman made his appearance at the office on the first Monday of the new\nyear. He had hitherto sat at the same desk with Alaric, each of them\noccupying one side of it; on his return he found himself opposite to a\nstranger. Alaric had, of course, been promoted to a room of his own.\n\nThe Weights and Measures had never been a noisy office; but now it\nbecame more silent than ever. Men there talked but little at any time,\nand now they seemed to cease from talking altogether. It was known\nto all that the Damon and Pythias of the establishment were Damon and\nPythias no longer; that war waged between them, and that if all accounts\nwere true, they were ready to fly each at the other's throat. Some\nattributed this to the competitive examination; others said it was love;\nothers declared that it was money, the root of evil; and one rash young\ngentleman stated his positive knowledge that it was all three. At any\nrate something dreadful was expected; and men sat anxious at their\ndesks, fearing the coming evil.\n\nOn the Monday the two men did not meet, nor on the Tuesday. On the\nnext morning, Alaric, having acknowledged to himself the necessity of\nbreaking the ice, walked into the room where Norman sat with three\nor four others. It was absolutely necessary that he should make some\narrangement with him as to a certain branch of office-work; and though\nit was competent for him, as the superior, to have sent for Norman as\nthe inferior, he thought it best to abstain from doing so, even though\nhe were thereby obliged to face his enemy, for the first time, in the\npresence of others.\n\n'Well, Mr. Embryo,' said he, speaking to the new junior, and standing\nwith his back to the fire in an easy way, as though there was nothing\nwrong under the sun, or at least nothing at the Weights and Measures,\n'well, Mr. Embryo, how do you get on with those calculations?'\n\n'Pretty well, I believe, sir; I think I begin to understand them now,'\nsaid the tyro, producing for Alaric's gratification five or six folio\nsheets covered with intricate masses of figures.\n\n'Ah! yes; that will do very well,' said Alaric, taking up one of the\nsheets, and looking at it with an assumed air of great interest. Though\nhe acted his part pretty well, his mind was very far removed from Mr.\nEmbryo's efforts.\n\nNorman sat at his desk, as black as a thunder-cloud, with his eyes\nturned intently at the paper before him; but so agitated that he could\nnot even pretend to write.\n\n'By the by, Norman,' said Alaric, 'when will it suit you to look through\nthose Scotch papers with me?'\n\n'My name, sir, is Mr. Norman,' said Harry, getting up and standing by\nhis chair with all the firmness of a Paladin of old.\n\n'With all my heart,' said Alaric. 'In speaking to you I can have but one\nwish, and that is to do so in any way that may best please you.'\n\n'Any instructions you may have to give I will attend to, as far as my\nduty goes,' said Norman.\n\nAnd then Alaric, pushing Mr. Embryo from his chair without much\nceremony, sat down opposite to his former friend, and said and did what\nhe had to say and do with an easy unaffected air, in which there was, at\nany rate, none of the usual superciliousness of a neophyte's authority.\nNorman was too agitated to speak reasonably, or to listen calmly, but\nAlaric knew that though he might not do so to-day, he would to-morrow,\nor if not to-morrow, then the next day; and so from day to day he\ncame into Norman's room and transacted his business. Mr. Embryo got\naccustomed to looking through the window at the Council Office for the\nten minutes that he remained there, and Norman also became reconciled to\nthe custom. And thus, though they never met in any other way, they daily\nhad a kind of intercourse with each other, which, at last, contrived to\nget itself arranged into a certain amount of civility on both sides.\n\nImmediately that Norman's arrival was heard of at Surbiton Cottage, Mrs.\nWoodward hastened up to town to see him. She wrote to him to say that\nshe would be at his lodgings at a certain hour, and begged him to come\nthither to her. Of course he did not refuse, and so they met. Mrs.\nWoodward had much doubted whether or no she would take Linda or Katie\nwith her, but at last she resolved to go alone. Harry, she thought,\nwould be more willing to speak freely to her, to open his heart to her,\nif there were nobody by but herself.\n\nTheir meeting was very touching, and characteristic of the two persons.\nMrs. Woodward was sad enough, but her sadness was accompanied by a\nstrength of affection that carried before it every obstacle. Norman was\nalso sad; but he was at first stern and cold, and would have remained\nso to the last, had not his manly anger been overpowered by her feminine\ntenderness.\n\nIt was singular, but not the less true, that at this period Norman\nappeared to have forgotten altogether that he had ever proposed to\nGertrude, and been rejected by her. All that he said and all that he\nthought was exactly what he might have said and thought had Alaric taken\nfrom him his affianced bride. No suitor had ever felt his suit to be\nmore hopeless than he had done; and yet he now regarded himself as one\nwhose high hopes of happy love had all been destroyed by the treachery\nof a friend and the fickleness of a woman.\n\nThis made the task of appeasing him very difficult to Mrs. Woodward.\nShe could not in plain language remind him that he had been plainly\nrejected; nor could she, on the other hand, permit her daughter to be\nbranded with a fault of which she had never been guilty.\n\nMrs. Woodward had wished, though she had hardly hoped, so to mollify\nNorman as to induce him to promise to be at the wedding; but she soon\nfound that this was out of the question. There was no mitigating his\nanger against Alaric.\n\n'Mrs. Woodward,' said he, standing very upright, and looking very stiff,\n'I will never again willingly put myself in any position where I must\nmeet him.'\n\n'Oh! Harry, don't say so--think of your close friendship, think of your\nlong friendship.'\n\n'Why did he not think of it?'\n\n'But, Harry--if not for his sake, if not for your own, at any rate do so\nfor ours; for my sake, for Katie's and Linda's, for Gertrude's sake.'\n\n'I had rather not speak of Gertrude, Mrs. Woodward.'\n\n'Ah! Harry, Gertrude has done you no injury; why should you thus turn\nyour heart against her? You should not blame her; if you have anyone to\nblame, it is me.'\n\n'No; you have been true to me.'\n\n'And has she been false? Oh! Harry, think how we have loved you! You\nshould be more just to us.'\n\n'Tush!' he said. 'I do not believe in justice; there is no justice\nleft. I would have given everything I had for him. I would have made any\nsacrifice. His happiness was as much my thought as my own. And now--and\nyet you talk to me of justice.'\n\n'And if he had injured you, Harry, would you not forgive him? Do you\nrepeat your prayers without thinking of them? Do you not wish to forgive\nthem that trespass against you?' Norman groaned inwardly in the spirit.\n'Do you not think of this when you kneel every night before your God?'\n\n'There are injuries which a man cannot forgive, is not expected to\nforgive.'\n\n'Are there, Harry? Oh! that is a dangerous doctrine. In that way every\nman might nurse his own wrath till anger would make devils of us all.\nOur Saviour has made no exceptions.'\n\n'In one sense, I do forgive him, Mrs. Woodward. I wish him no evil.\nBut it is impossible that I should call a man who has so injured me my\nfriend. I look upon him as disgraced for ever.'\n\nShe then endeavoured to persuade him to see Gertrude, or at any rate to\nsend his love to her. But in this also he was obdurate. 'It could,' he\nsaid, 'do no good.' He could not answer for himself that his feelings\nwould not betray him. A message would be of no use; if true, it would\nnot be gracious; if false, it had better be avoided. He was quite sure\nGertrude would be indifferent as to any message from him. The best thing\nfor them both would be that they should forget each other.\n\nHe promised, however, that he would go down to Hampton immediately after\nthe marriage, and he sent his kindest love to Linda and Katie. 'And,\ndear Mrs. Woodward,' said he, 'I know you think me very harsh, I know\nyou think me vindictive--but pray, pray believe that I understand all\nyour love, and acknowledge all your goodness. The time will, perhaps,\ncome when we shall be as happy together as we once were.'\n\nMrs. Woodward, trying to smile through her tears, could only say that\nshe would pray that that time might soon come; and so, bidding God bless\nhim, as a mother might bless her child, she left him and returned to\nHampton, not with a light heart.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nTHE FIRST WEDDING\n\n\nIn spite, however, of Norman and his anger, on a cold snowy morning in\nthe month of February, Gertrude stood at the altar in Hampton Church,\na happy trusting bride, and Linda stood smiling behind her, the lovely\nleader of the nuptial train. Nor were Linda's smiles false or forced,\nmuch less treacherous. She had taught herself to look on Alaric as her\nsister's husband, and though in doing so she had suffered, and did still\nsuffer, she now thought of her own lost lover in no other guise.\n\nA housemaid, not long since, who was known in the family in which she\nlived to be affianced to a neighbouring gardener, came weeping to her\nmistress.\n\n'Oh, ma'am!'\n\n'Why, Susan, what ails you?'\n\n'Oh, ma'am!'\n\n'Well, Susan--what is it?--why are you crying?'\n\n'Oh, ma'am--John!'\n\n'Well--what of John? I hope he is not misbehaving.'\n\n'Indeed, ma'am, he is then; the worst of misbehaviour; for he's gone and\ngot hisself married.' And poor Susan gave vent to a flood of tears.\n\nHer mistress tried to comfort her, and not in vain. She told her that\nprobably she might be better as she was; that John, seeing what he had\ndone, must be a false creature, who would undoubtedly have used her ill;\nand she ended her good counsel by trying to make Susan understand that\nthere were still as good fish in the sea as had ever yet been caught out\nof it.\n\n'And that's true too, ma'am,' said Susan, with her apron to her eyes.\n\n'Then you should not be downhearted, you know.'\n\n'Nor I han't down'arted, ma'am, for thank God I could love any man, but\nit's the looks on it, ma'am; it's that I mind.'\n\nHow many of us are there, women and men too, who think most of the\n'looks of it' under such circumstances; and who, were we as honest as\npoor Susan, ought to thank God, as she did, that we can love anyone;\nanyone, that is, of the other sex. We are not all of us susceptible of\nbeing torn to tatters by an unhappy passion; not even all those of us\nwho may be susceptible of a true and honest love. And it is well that it\nis so. It is one of God's mercies; and if we were as wise as Susan, we\nshould thank God for it.\n\nLinda was, perhaps, one of those. She was good, affectionate, tender,\nand true. But she was made of that stuff which can bend to the north\nwind. The world was not all over with her because a man had been untrue\nto her. She had had her grief, and had been told to meet it like a\nChristian; she had been obedient to the telling, and now felt the good\nresult. So when Gertrude was married she stood smiling behind her; and\nwhen her new brother-in-law kissed her in the vestry-room she smiled\nagain, and honestly wished them happiness.\n\nAnd Katie was there, very pretty and bonny, still childish, with her\nshort dress and long trousers, but looking as though she, too, would\nsoon feel the strength of her own wings, and be able to fly away from\nher mother's nest. Dear Katie! Her story has yet to be told. To her\nbelongs neither the soft easiness of her sister Linda nor the sterner\ndignity of Gertrude. But she has a character of her own, which contains,\nperhaps, higher qualities than those given to either of her sisters.\n\nAnd there were other bridesmaids there; how many it boots not now to\nsay. We must have the spaces round our altars greatly widened if\nthis passion for bevies of attendant nymphs be allowed to go on\nincreasing--and if crinolines increase also. If every bride is to have\ntwelve maidens, and each maiden to stand on no less than a twelve-yard\ncircle, what modest temple will ever suffice for a sacrifice to Hymen?\n\nAnd Mrs. Woodward was there, of course; as pretty to my thinking as\neither of her daughters, or any of the bridesmaids. She was very pretty\nand smiling and quiet. But when Gertrude said 'I will,' she was thinking\nof Harry Norman, and grieving that he was not there.\n\nAnd Captain Cuttwater was there, radiant in a new blue coat, made\nspecially for the occasion, and elastic with true joy. He had been very\ngenerous. He had given \u00c2\u00a31,000 to Alaric, and settled \u00c2\u00a3150 a year on\nGertrude, payable, of course, after his death. This, indeed, was the\nbulk of what he had to give, and Mrs. Woodward had seen with regret\nhis exuberant munificence to one of her children. But Gertrude was her\nchild, and of course she could not complain.\n\nAnd Charley was there, acting as best man. It was just the place and\njust the work for Charley. He forgot all his difficulties, all his\nduns, and also all his town delights. Without a sigh he left his lady in\nNorfolk Street to mix gin-sling for other admirers, and felt no regret\nthough four brother navvies were going to make a stunning night of it at\nthe 'Salon de Seville dansant,' at the bottom of Holborn Hill. However,\nhe had his hopes that he might be back in time for some of that fun.\n\nAnd Undy Scott was there. He and Alaric had fraternized so greatly\nof late that the latter had, as a matter of course, asked him to his\nwedding, and Mrs. Woodward had of course expressed her delight at\nreceiving Alaric's friend. Undy also was a pleasant fellow for a wedding\nparty; he was full of talk, fond of ladies, being no whit abashed in his\nattendance on them by the remembrance of his bosom's mistress, whom he\nhad left, let us hope, happy in her far domestic retirement. Undy Scott\nwas a good man at a wedding, and made himself specially agreeable on\nthis occasion.\n\nBut the great glory of the day was the presence of Sir Gregory\nHardlines. It was a high honour, considering all that rested on Sir\nGregory's shoulders, for so great a man to come all the way down to\nHampton to see a clerk in the Weights and Measures married.\n\n  Cum tot sustineas, et tanta negotia solus,\n\n--for we may call it 'solus,' Sir Warwick and Mr. Jobbles being sources\nof more plague than profit in carrying out your noble schemes--while so\nmany things are on your shoulders, Sir Gregory; while you are defending\nthe Civil Service by your pen, adorning it by your conduct, perfecting\nit by new rules, how could any man have had the face to ask you to a\nwedding?\n\nNevertheless Sir Gregory was there, and did not lose the excellent\nopportunity which a speech at the breakfast-table afforded him for\nexpressing his opinion on the Civil Service of his country.\n\nAnd so Gertrude Woodward became Gertrude Tudor, and she and Alaric were\nwhirled away by a post-chaise and post-boy, done out with white bows,\nto the Hampton Court station; from thence they whisked up to London, and\nthen down to Dover; and there we will leave them.\n\nThey were whisked away, having first duly gone through the amount of\nbadgering which the bride and bridegroom have to suffer at the wedding\nbreakfast-table. They drank their own health in champagne. Alaric made a\nspeech, in which he said he was quite unworthy of his present happiness,\nand Gertrude picked up all the bijoux, gold pencil-cases, and silver\ncream-jugs, which were thrown at her from all sides. All the men made\nspeeches, and all the women laughed, but the speech of the day was that\ncelebrated one made by Sir Gregory, in which he gave a sketch of Alaric\nTudor as the beau id\u00c3\u00a9al of a clerk in the Civil Service. 'His heart,'\nsaid he, energetically, 'is at the Weights and Measures;' but Gertrude\nlooked at him as though she did not believe a word of it.\n\nAnd so Alaric and Gertrude were whisked away, and the wedding guests\nwere left to look sheepish at each other, and take themselves off as\nbest they might. Sir Gregory, of course, had important public business\nwhich precluded him from having the gratification of prolonging his stay\nat Hampton. Charley got away in perfect time to enjoy whatever there\nmight be to be enjoyed at the dancing saloon of Seville, and Undy Scott\nreturned to his club.\n\nThen all was again quiet at Surbiton Cottage. Captain Cuttwater, who had\nperhaps drunk the bride's health once too often, went to sleep; Katie,\nhaving taken off her fine clothes, roamed about the house disconsolate,\nand Mrs. Woodward and Linda betook themselves to their needles.\n\nThe Tudors went to Brussels, and were made welcome by the Belgian\nbanker, whose counters he had deserted so much to his own benefit, and\nfrom thence to Paris, and, having been there long enough to buy a French\nbonnet and wonder at the enormity of French prices, they returned to\na small but comfortable house they had prepared for themselves in the\nneighbourhood of Westbourne Terrace.\n\nPrevious to this Norman had been once, and but once, at Hampton, and,\nwhen there, he had failed in being comfortable himself, or in making the\nWoodwards so; he could not revert to his old habits, or sit, or move,\nor walk, as though nothing special had happened since he had been last\nthere. He could not talk about Gertrude, and he could not help talking\nof her. By some closer packing among the ladies a room had now been\nprepared for him in the house; even this upset him, and brought to his\nmind all those unpleasant thoughts which he should have endeavoured to\navoid.\n\nHe did not repeat his visit before the Tudors returned; and then\nfor some time he was prevented from doing so by the movements of\nthe Woodwards themselves. Mrs. Woodward paid a visit to her married\ndaughter, and, when she returned, Linda did the same. And so for a while\nNorman was, as it were, divided from his old friends, whereas Tudor, as\na matter of course, was one of themselves.\n\nIt was only natural that Mrs. Woodward should forgive Alaric and receive\nhim to her bosom, now that he was her son-in-law. After all, such ties\nas these avail more than any predilections, more than any effort of\njudgement in the choice of the objects of our affections. We associate\nwith those with whom the tenor of life has thrown us, and from habit we\nlearn to love those with whom we are brought to associate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS. VAL AND MISS GOLIGHTLY\n\n\nThe first eighteen months of Gertrude's married life were not unhappy,\nthough, like all persons entering on the realities of the world,\nshe found much to disappoint her. At first her husband's society was\nsufficient for her; and to give him his due, he was not at first an\ninattentive husband. Then came the baby, bringing with him, as first\nbabies always should do, a sort of second honeymoon of love, and a\nrenewal of those services which women so delight to receive from their\nbosoms' lord.\n\nShe had of course made acquaintances since she had settled herself in\nLondon, and had, in her modest way, done her little part in adding to\nthe gaiety of the great metropolis. In this respect indeed Alaric's\ncommencement of life had somewhat frightened Mrs. Woodward, and the more\nprudent of his friends. Grand as his official promotion had been, his\nofficial income at the time of his marriage did not exceed \u00c2\u00a3600 a year,\nand though this was to be augmented occasionally till it reached \u00c2\u00a3800,\nyet even with this advantage it could hardly suffice for a man and his\nwife and a coming family to live in an expensive part of London, and\nenable him to 'see his friends' occasionally, as the act of feeding\none's acquaintance is now generally called.\n\nGertrude, like most English girls of her age, was at first so ignorant\nabout money that she hardly knew whether \u00c2\u00a3600 was or was not a\nsufficient income to justify their present mode of living; but she soon\nfound reason to suspect that her husband at any rate endeavoured to\nincrease it by other means. We say to suspect, because he never spoke to\nher on the subject; he never told her of Mary Janes and New Friendships;\nor hinted that he had extensive money dealings in connexion with Undy\nScott.\n\nBut it can be taken for granted that no husband can carry on such\ndealings long without some sort of cognizance on his wife's part as to\nwhat he is doing; a woman who is not trusted by her lord may choose\nto remain in apparent darkness, may abstain from questions, and may\nconsider it either her duty or her interest to assume an ignorance as\nto her husband's affairs; but the partner of one's bed and board, the\nminister who soothes one's headaches, and makes one's tea, and looks\nafter one's linen, can't but have the means of guessing the thoughts\nwhich occupy her companion's mind and occasionally darken his brow.\n\nMuch of Gertrude's society had consisted of that into which Alaric was\nthrown by his friendship with Undy Scott. There was a brother of Undy's\nliving in town, one Valentine Scott--a captain in a cavalry regiment,\nand whose wife was by no means of that delightfully retiring disposition\nevinced by Undy's better half. The Hon. Mrs. Valentine, or Mrs. Val\nScott as she was commonly called, was a very pushing woman, and pushed\nherself into a prominent place among Gertrude's friends. She had been\nthe widow of Jonathan Golightly, Esq., umquhile sheriff of the city of\nLondon, and stockbroker, and when she gave herself and her jointure\nup to Captain Val, she also brought with her, to enliven the house,\na daughter Clementina, the only remaining pledge of her love for the\nstockbroker.\n\nWhen Val Scott entered the world, his father's precepts as to the\npurposes of matrimony were deeply graven on his heart. He was the best\nlooking of the family, and, except Undy, the youngest. He had not Undy's\nsharpness, his talent for public matters, or his aptitude for the higher\nbranches of the Civil Service; but he had wit to wear his sash and\nepaulets with an easy grace, and to captivate the heart, person, and\nsome portion of the purse, of the Widow Golightly. The lady was ten\nyears older than the gentleman; but then she had a thousand a year, and,\nto make matters more pleasant, the beauteous Clementina had a fortune of\nher own.\n\nUnder these circumstances the marriage had been contracted without any\ndeceit, or attempt at deceit, by either party. Val wanted an income,\nand the sheriff's widow wanted the utmost amount of social consideration\nwhich her not very extensive means would purchase for her. On the whole,\nthe two parties to the transaction were contented with their bargain.\nMrs. Val, it is true, kept her income very much in her own hands; but\nstill she consented to pay Val's tailors' bills, and it is something for\na man to have bed and board found him for nothing. It is true, again,\nthe lady did not find that the noble blood of her husband gave her an\nimmediate right of entry into the best houses in London; but it did\nbring her into some sort of contact with some few people of rank and\nfame; and being a sensible woman, she had not been unreasonable in her\nexpectations.\n\nWhen she had got what she could from her husband in this particular,\nshe did not trouble him much further. He delighted in the Rag, and there\nspent the most of his time; happily, she delighted in what she called\nthe charms of society, and as society expanded itself before her, she\nwas also, we must suppose, happy. She soon perceived that more in her\nimmediate line was to be obtained from Undy than from her own member of\nthe Gaberlunzie family, and hence had sprung up her intimacy with Mrs.\nTudor.\n\nIt cannot be said that Gertrude was very fond of the Honourable Mrs.\nVal, nor even of her daughter, Clementina Golightly, who was more of\nher own age. These people had become her friends from the force of\ncircumstances, and not from predilection. To tell the truth, Mrs. Val,\nwho had in her day encountered, with much patience, a good deal of\nsnubbing, and who had had to be thankful when she was patronized, now\nfelt that her day for being a great lady had come, and that it behoved\nher to patronize others. She tried her hand upon Gertrude, and found the\npractice so congenial to her spirits, so pleasantly stimulating, so well\nadapted to afford a gratifying compensation for her former humility,\nthat she continued to give up a good deal of her time to No. 5, Albany\nRow, Westbourne Terrace, at which house the Tudors resided.\n\nThe young bride was not exactly the woman to submit quietly to patronage\nfrom any Mrs. Val, however honourable she might be; but for a while\nGertrude hardly knew what it meant; and at her first outset the natural\nmodesty of youth, and her inexperience in her new position, made her\nunwilling to take offence and unequal to rebellion. By degrees, however,\nthis feeling of humility wore off; she began to be aware of the assumed\nsuperiority of Mrs. Val's friendship, and by the time that their mutual\naffection was of a year's standing, Gertrude had determined, in a quiet\nway, without saying anything to anybody, to put herself on a footing of\nmore perfect equality with the Honourable Mrs. Val.\n\nClementina Golightly was, in the common parlance of a large portion of\nmankind, a 'doosed fine gal.' She stood five feet six, and stood very\nwell, on very good legs, but with rather large feet. She was as straight\nas a grenadier, and had it been her fate to carry a milk-pail, she\nwould have carried it to perfection. Instead of this, however, she was\npermitted to expend an equal amount of energy in every variation of\nwaltz and polka that the ingenuity of the dancing professors of the age\nhas been able to produce. Waltzes and polkas suited her admirably; for\nshe was gifted with excellent lungs and perfect powers of breathing, and\nshe had not much delight in prolonged conversation. Her fault, if she\nhad one, was a predilection for flirting; but she did her flirtations in\na silent sort of way, much as we may suppose the fishes do theirs, whose\namours we may presume to consist in swimming through their cool element\nin close contiguity with each other. 'A feast of reason and a flow of\nsoul' were not the charms by which Clementina Golightly essayed to keep\nher admirers spell-bound at her feet. To whirl rapidly round a room at\nthe rate of ten miles an hour, with her right hand outstretched in the\ngrasp of her partner's, and to know that she was tightly buoyed up, like\na horse by a bearing-rein, by his other hand behind her back, was for\nher sufficient. To do this, as she did do it, without ever crying for\nmercy, with no slackness of breath, and apparently without distress,\nmust have taken as much training as a horse gets for a race. But the\ntraining had in nowise injured her; and now, having gone through her\ngallops and run all her heats for three successive seasons, she was\nstill sound of wind and limb, and fit to run at any moment when called\nupon.\n\nWe have said nothing about the face of the beauteous Clementina, and\nindeed nothing can be said about it. There was no feature in it with\nwhich a man could have any right to find fault; that she was a 'doosed\nfine girl' was a fact generally admitted; but nevertheless you might\nlook at her for four hours consecutively on a Monday evening, and yet\non Tuesday you would not know her. She had hair which was brownish and\nsufficiently silky--and which she wore, as all other such girls do,\npropped out on each side of her face by thick round velvet pads,\nwhich, when the waltzing pace became exhilarating, occasionally showed\nthemselves, looking greasy. She had a pair of eyes set straight in her\nhead, faultless in form, and perfectly inexpressive. She had a nose\nequally straight, but perhaps a little too coarse in dimensions. She had\na mouth not over large, with two thin lips and small whitish teeth; and\nshe had a chin equal in contour to the rest of her face, but on which\nVenus had not deigned to set a dimple. Nature might have defied a French\npassport officer to give a description of her, by which even her own\nmother or a detective policeman might have recognized her.\n\nWhen to the above list of attractions it is added that Clementina\nGolightly had \u00c2\u00a320,000 of her own, and a reversionary interest in\nher mother's jointure, it may be imagined that she did not want for\ngood-winded cavaliers to bear her up behind, and whirl around with her\nwith outstretched hands.\n\n'I am not going to stay a moment, my dear,' said Mrs. Val, seating\nherself on Gertrude's sofa, having rushed up almost unannounced into the\ndrawing-room, followed by Clementina; 'indeed, Lady Howlaway is\nwaiting for me this moment; but I must settle with you about the June\nflower-show.'\n\n'Oh! thank you, Mrs. Scott, don't trouble yourself about me,' said\nGertrude; 'I don't think I shall go.'\n\n'Oh! nonsense, my dear; of course you'll go; it's the show of the year,\nand the Grand duke is to be there--baby is all right now, you know; I\nmust not hear of your not going.'\n\n'All the same--I fear I must decline,' said Gertrude; 'I think I shall\nbe at Hampton.'\n\n'Oh! nonsense, my dear; of course you must show yourself. People will\nsay all manner of things else. Clementina has promised to meet Victoire\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a1pes there and a party of French people, people of the very\nhighest ton. You'll be delighted, my dear.'\n\n'M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a1pes is the most delicious polkist you ever met,' said\nClementina. 'He has got a new back step that will quite amaze you.' As\nGertrude in her present condition was not much given to polkas, this\ntemptation did not have great effect.\n\n'Oh, you must come, of course, my dear--and pray let me recommend you to\ngo to Madame Bosconi for your bonnet; she has such darling little ducks,\nand as cheap as dirt. But I want you to arrange about the carriage;\nyou can do that with Mr. Tudor, and I can settle with you afterwards.\nCaptain Scott won't go, of course; but I have no doubt Undecimus and Mr.\nTudor will come later and bring us home; we can manage very well with\nthe one carriage.'\n\nIn spite of her thousand a year the Honourable Mrs. Val was not ashamed\nto look after the pounds, shillings, and pence. And so, having made her\narrangements, Mrs. Val took herself off, hurrying to appease the anger\nof Lady Howlaway, and followed by Clementina, who since her little\noutburst as to the new back step of M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a1pes had not taken much\npart in the conversation.\n\nFlower-shows are a great resource for the Mrs. Scotts of London life.\nThey are open to ladies who cannot quite penetrate the inner sancta of\nfashionable life, and yet they are frequented by those to whom those\nsancta are everyday household walks. There at least the Mrs. Scotts of\nthe outer world can show themselves in close contiguity, and on equal\nterms, with the Mrs. Scotts of the inner world. And then, who is to\nknow the difference? If also one is an Honourable Mrs. Scott, and can\ncontrive to appear as such in the next day's _Morning Post_, may not one\nfairly boast that the ends of society have been attained? Where is the\ncitadel? How is one to know when one has taken it?\n\nGertrude could not be quite so defiant with her friends as she would\nhave wished to have been, as they were borne with and encouraged by\nher husband. Of Undy's wife Alaric saw nothing and heard little, but\nit suited Undy to make use of his sister-in-law's house, and it suited\nAlaric to be intimate with Undy's sister-in-law. Moreover, had not\nClementina Golightly \u00c2\u00a320,000, and was she not a 'doosed fine girl?' This\nwas nothing to Alaric now, and might not be considered to be much to\nUndy. But that far-seeing, acute financier knew that there were other\nmeans of handling a lady's money than that of marrying her. He could not\nat present acquire a second fortune in that way; but he might perhaps\nacquire the management of this \u00c2\u00a320,000 if he could provide the lady\nwith a husband of the proper temperament. Undy Scott did not want\nto appropriate Miss Golightly's fortune, he only wanted to have the\nmanagement of it.\n\nLooking round among his acquaintance for a fitting _parti_ for the sweet\nClementina, his mind, after much consideration, settled upon Charley\nTudor. There were many young men much nearer and dearer to Undy than\nCharley, who might be equally desirous of so great a prize; but he could\nthink of none over whom he might probably exercise so direct a control.\nCharley was a handsome gay fellow, and waltzed _au ravir_; he might,\ntherefore, without difficulty, make his way with the fair Clementina.\nHe was distressingly poor, and would therefore certainly jump at an\nheiress--he was delightfully thoughtless and easy of leading, and\ntherefore the money, when in his hands, might probably be manageable. He\nwas also Alaric's cousin, and therefore acceptable.\n\nUndy did not exactly open his mind to Alaric Tudor in this matter.\nAlaric's education was going on rapidly; but his mind had not yet\nreceived with sufficient tenacity those principles of philosophy which\nwould enable him to look at this scheme in its proper light. He had\nalready learnt the great utility, one may almost say the necessity, of\nhaving a command of money; he was beginning also to perceive that money\nwas a thing not to be judged of by the ordinary rules which govern\na man's conduct. In other matters it behoves a gentleman to be open,\nabove-board, liberal, and true; good-natured, generous, confiding,\nself-denying, doing unto others as he would wish that others should do\nunto him; but in the acquirement and use of money--that is, its use\nwith the object of acquiring more, its use in the usurer's sense--his\npractice should be exactly the reverse; he should be close, secret,\nexacting, given to concealment, not over troubled by scruples;\nsuspicious, without sympathies, self-devoted, and always doing unto\nothers exactly that which he is on his guard to prevent others from\ndoing unto him--viz., making money by them. So much Alaric had learnt,\nand had been no inapt scholar. But he had not yet appreciated the full\nvalue of the latitude allowed by the genius of the present age to men\nwho deal successfully in money. He had, as we have seen, acknowledged\nto himself that a sportsman may return from the field with his legs and\nfeet a little muddy; but he did not yet know how deep a man may wallow\nin the mire, how thoroughly he may besmear himself from head to foot\nin the blackest, foulest mud, and yet be received an honoured guest by\nladies gay and noble lords, if only his bag be sufficiently full.\n\n  Rem..., quocunque modo rem!\n\nThe remainder of the passage was doubtless applicable to former times,\nbut now is hardly worth repeating.\n\nAs Alaric's stomach was not yet quite suited for strong food, Undy\nfitted this matter to his friend's still juvenile capacities. There\nwas an heiress, a 'doosed fine girl' as Undy insisted, laying peculiar\nstrength on the word of emphasis, with \u00c2\u00a320,000, and there was Charley\nTudor, a devilish decent fellow, without a rap. Why not bring them\ntogether? This would only be a mark of true friendship on the part of\nUndy; and on Alaric's part, it would be no more than one cousin would be\nbound to do for another. Looking at it in this light, Alaric saw nothing\nin the matter which could interfere with his quiet conscience.\n\n'I'll do what I can,' said Undy. 'Mrs. Val is inclined to have a way of\nher own in most things; but if anybody can lead her, I can. Charley\nmust take care that Val himself doesn't take his part, that's all. If he\ninterferes, it would be all up with us.'\n\nAnd thus Alaric, intent mainly on the interest of his cousin, and\nactuated perhaps a little by the feeling that a rich cousin would be\nmore serviceable than a poor one, set himself to work, in connexion with\nUndy Scott, to make prey of Clementina Golightly's \u00c2\u00a320,000.\n\nBut if Undy had no difficulty in securing the co-operation of Alaric\nin this matter, Alaric by no means found it equally easy to secure the\nco-operation of Charley. Charley Tudor had not yet learnt to look\nupon himself as a marketable animal, worth a certain sum of money, in\nconsequence of such property in good appearance, address, &c., as God\nhad been good enough to endow him withal.\n\nHe daily felt the depth and disagreeable results of his own poverty, and\nnot unfrequently, when specially short of the Queen's medium, sighed for\nsome of those thousands and tens of thousands with which men's mouths\nare so glibly full. He had often tried to calculate what would be his\nfeelings if some eccentric, good-natured old stranger should leave him,\nsay, five thousand a year; he had often walked about the street, with\nhis hands in his empty pockets, building delicious castles in the air,\nand doing the most munificent actions imaginable with his newly-acquired\nwealth, as all men in such circumstances do; relieving distress,\nrewarding virtue, and making handsome presents to all his friends,\nand especially to Mrs. Woodward. So far Charley was not guiltless of\ncoveting wealth; but he had never for a moment thought of realizing his\ndreams by means of his personal attractions. It had never occurred to\nhim that any girl having money could think it worth her while to marry\nhim. He, navvy as he was, with his infernal friends and pot-house love,\nwith his debts and idleness and low associations, with his saloons of\nSeville, his Elysium in Fleet Street, and his Paradise near the Surrey\nGardens, had hitherto thought little enough of his own attractions. No\nkind father had taught him that he was worth \u00c2\u00a310,000 in any market in\nthe world. When he had dreamt of money, he had never dreamt of it as\naccruing to him in return for any value or worth which he had inherent\nin himself. Even in his lighter moments he had no such conceit; and at\nthose periods, few and far between, in which he did think seriously\nof the world at large, this special method of escaping from his\ndifficulties--never once presented itself to his mind.\n\nWhen, therefore, Alaric first spoke to him of marrying \u00c2\u00a320,000 and\nClementina Golightly, his surprise was unbounded.\n\n'\u00c2\u00a320,000!' said Alaric, 'and a doosed fine girl, you know;' and he\nalso laid great stress on the latter part of the offer, knowing how\ninflammable was Charley's heart, and at the same time how little\nmercenary was his mind.\n\nBut Charley was not only surprised at the proposed arrangement, but\napparently also unwilling to enter into it. He argued that in the first\nplace no girl in her senses would accept him. To this Alaric replied\nthat as Clementina had not much sense to speak of, that objection might\nfall to the ground. Then Charley expressed an idea that Miss Golightly's\nfriends might probably object when they learnt what were the exact\npecuniary resources of the expectant husband; to which Alaric argued\nthat the circumstances of the case were very lucky, inasmuch as some of\nClementina's natural friends were already prepossessed in favour of such\nan arrangement.\n\nDriven thus from two of his strongholds, Charley, in the most modest\nof voices, in a voice one may say quite shamefaced and conscious of\nits master's weakness--suggested that he was not quite sure that at the\npresent moment he was very much in love with the lady in question.\n\nAlaric had married for love, and was not two years married, yet had his\neducation so far progressed in that short period as to enable him to\nlaugh at such an objection.\n\n'Then, my dear fellow, what the deuce do you mean to do with yourself?\nYou'll certainly go to the dogs.\n\nCharley had an idea that he certainly should; and also had an idea that\nMiss Clementina and her \u00c2\u00a320,000 might not improbably go in the same\ndirection, if he had anything to do with them.\n\n'And as for loving her,' continued Alaric, 'that's all my eye. Love is\na luxury which none but the rich or the poor can afford. We middle-class\npaupers, who are born with good coats on our backs, but empty purses,\ncan have nothing to do with it.'\n\n'But you married for love, Alaric?'\n\n'My marriage was not a very prudent one, and should not be taken as an\nexample. And then I did get some fortune with my wife; and what is more,\nI was not so fearfully in want of it as you are.'\n\nCharley acknowledged the truth of this, said that he would think of the\nmatrimonial project, and promised, at any rate, to call on Clementina\non an early occasion. He had already made her acquaintance, had already\ndanced with her, and certainly could not take upon himself to deny that\nshe was a 'doosed fine girl.'\n\nBut Charley had reasons of his own, reasons which he could not make\nknown to Alaric, for not thinking much of, or trusting much to, Miss\nGolightly's fortune. In the first place, he regarded marriage on such a\ngrand scale as that now suggested, as a ceremony which must take a long\ntime to adjust; the wooing of a lady with so many charms could not\nbe carried on as might be the wooing of a chambermaid or a farmer's\ndaughter. It must take months at least to conciliate the friends of so\nrich an heiress, and months at the end of them to prepare the wedding\ngala. But Charley could not wait for months; before one month was over\nhe would probably be laid up in some vile limbo, an unfortunate poor\nprisoner at the suit of an iron-hearted tailor.\n\nAt this very moment of Alaric's proposition, at this instant when\nhe found himself talking with so much coolness of the expedience or\ninexpedience of appropriating to his own purpose a slight trifle of\n\u00c2\u00a320,000, he was in dire strait as to money difficulties.\n\nHe had lately, that is, within the last twelve months, made acquaintance\nwith an interesting gentleman named Jabesh M'Ruen. Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen\nwas in the habit of relieving the distresses of such impoverished young\ngentlemen as Charley Tudor; and though he did this with every\nassurance of philanthropic regard, though in doing so he only made one\nstipulation, 'Pray be punctual, Mr. Tudor, now pray do be punctual,\nsir, and you may always count on me,' nevertheless, in spite of all\nhis goodness, Mr. M'Ruen's young friends seldom continued to hold their\nheads well up over the world's waters.\n\nOn the morning after this conversation with Alaric, Charley intended\nto call on his esteemed old friend. Many were the morning calls he did\nmake; many were the weary, useless, aimless walks which he took to that\nlittle street at the back of Mecklenburg Square, with the fond hope of\ngetting some relief from Mr. M'Ruen; and many also were the calls,\nthe return visits, as it were, which Mr. M'Ruen made at the Internal\nNavigation, and numerous were the whispers which he would there whisper\ninto the ears of the young clerk, Mr. Snape the while sitting by, with\na sweet unconscious look, as though he firmly believed Mr. M'Ruen to be\nCharley's maternal uncle.\n\nAnd then, too, Charley had other difficulties, which in his mind\npresented great obstacles to the Golightly scheme, though Alaric would\nhave thought little of them, and Undy nothing. What was he to do with\nhis Norfolk Street lady, his barmaid houri, his Norah Geraghty, to whom\nhe had sworn all manner of undying love, and for whom in some sort of\nfashion he really had an affection? And Norah was not a light-of-love\nwhom it was as easy to lay down as to pick up. Charley had sworn to love\nher, and she had sworn to love Charley; and to give her her due, she had\nkept her word to him. Though her life rendered necessary a sort of daily\nor rather nightly flirtation with various male comers--as indeed, for\nthe matter of that, did also the life of Miss Clementina Golightly--yet\nshe had in her way been true to her lover. She had been true to him,\nand Charley did not doubt her, and in a sort of low way respected her;\nthough it was but a dissipated and debauched respect. There had even\nbeen talk between them of marriage, and who can say what in his softer\nmoments, when his brain had been too weak or the toddy too strong,\nCharley may not have promised?\n\nAnd there was yet another objection to Miss Golightly; one even more\ndifficult of mention, one on which Charley felt himself more absolutely\nconstrained to silence than even either of the other two. He was\nsufficiently disinclined to speak to his cousin Alaric as to the merits\neither of Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen or of Miss Geraghty, but he could have been\neloquent on either rather than whisper a word as to the third person who\nstood between him and the \u00c2\u00a320,000.\n\nThe school in which Charley now lived, that of the infernal navvies,\nhad taught him to laugh at romance; but it had not been so successful in\nquelling the early feelings of his youth, in drying up the fountains of\npoetry within him, as had been the case with his cousin, in that\nother school in which he had been a scholar. Charley was a dissipated,\ndissolute rake, and in some sense had degraded himself; but he had still\nthis chance of safety on his side, that he himself reprobated his own\nsins. He dreamt of other things and a better life. He made visions to\nhimself of a sweet home, and a sweeter, sweetest, lovely wife; a love\nwhose hair should not be redolent of smoke, nor her hands reeking with\ngin, nor her services at the demand of every libertine who wanted a\nscrew of tobacco, or a glass of 'cold without.'\n\nHe had made such a vision to himself, and the angel with which he had\nfilled it was not a creature of his imagination. She who was to reign\nin this ethereal paradise, this happy home, far as the poles away\nfrom Norfolk Street, was a living being in the sublunar globe, present\nsometimes to Charley's eyes, and now so often present to his thoughts;\nand yet she was but a child, and as ignorant that she had ever touched a\nlover's heart by her childish charms as though she had been a baby.\n\nAfter all, even on Charley's part, it was but a vision. He never really\nthought that his young inamorata would or could be to him a real true\nheart's companion, returning his love with the double love of a woman,\nwatching his health, curing his vices, and making the sweet things\nof the world a living reality around him. This love of his was but\na vision, but not the less on that account did it interfere with his\ncousin Alaric's proposition, in reference to Miss Clementina Golightly.\n\nThat other love also, that squalid love of his, was in truth no\nvision--was a stern, palpable reality, very difficult to get rid of,\nand one which he often thought to himself would very probably swallow up\nthat other love, and drive his sweet dream far away into utter darkness\nand dim chaotic space.\n\nBut at any rate it was clear that there was no room in his heart for\nthe beauteous Clementina, 'doosed fine girl' as she undoubtedly was, and\nserviceable as the \u00c2\u00a320,000 most certainly would have been.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nA DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES.--MORNING\n\n\nOn the morning after this conversation with Alaric, Charley left his\nlodgings with a heavy heart, and wended his way towards Mecklenburg\nSquare. At the corner of Davies Street he got an omnibus, which for\nfourpence took him to one of the little alleys near Gray's Inn, and\nthere he got down, and threading the well-known locality, through\nBedford Place and across Theobald's Road, soon found himself at the door\nof his generous patron. Oh! how he hated the house; how he hated the\nblear-eyed, cross-grained, dirty, impudent fish-fag of an old woman who\nopened the door for him; how he hated Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen, to whom he now\ncame a supplicant for assistance, and how, above all, he hated himself\nfor being there.\n\nHe was shown into Mr. M'Ruen's little front parlour, where he had to\nwait for fifteen minutes, while his patron made such a breakfast as\ngenerally falls to the lot of such men. We can imagine the rancid\nbutter, the stale befingered bread, the ha'porth of sky-blue milk, the\ntea innocent of China's wrongs, and the soiled cloth. Mr. M'Ruen\nalways did keep Charley waiting fifteen minutes, and so he was no whit\nsurprised; the doing so was a part of the tremendous interest which the\nwretched old usurer received for his driblets of money.\n\nThere was not a bit of furniture in the room on which Charley had not\nspeculated till speculation could go no further; the old escritoire or\nsecr\u00c3\u00a9taire which Mr. M'Ruen always opened the moment he came into the\nroom; the rickety Pembroke table, covered with dirty papers which stood\nin the middle of it; the horsehair-bottomed chairs, on which Charley\ndeclined to sit down, unless he had on his thickest winter trousers, so\nperpendicular had become some atoms on the surface, which, when new, had\nno doubt been horizontal; the ornaments (!) on the chimney, broken bits\nof filthy crockery, full of wisps of paper, with a china duck without a\ntail, and a dog to correspond without a head; the pictures against\nthe wall, with their tarnished dingy frames and cracked glasses,\nrepresenting three of the Seasons; how the fourth had gone before its\ntime to its final bourne by an unhappy chance, Mr. M'Ruen had once\nexplained to Charley, while endeavouring to make his young customer\ntake the other three as a good value for \u00c2\u00a37 10s. in arranging a little\ntransaction, the total amount of which did not exceed \u00c2\u00a315.\n\nIn that instance, however, Charley, who had already dabbled somewhat\ndeeply in dressing-cases, utterly refused to trade in the articles\nproduced.\n\nCharley stood with his back to the dog and duck, facing Winter, with\nSpring on his right and Autumn on his left; it was well that Summer was\ngone, no summer could have shed light on that miserable chamber. He knew\nthat he would have to wait, and was not therefore impatient, and at\nthe end of fifteen minutes Mr. M'Ruen shuffled into the room in his\nslippers.\n\nHe was a little man, with thin grey hair, which stood upright from his\nnarrow head--what his age might have been it was impossible to guess; he\nwas wizened, and dry, and grey, but still active enough on his legs\nwhen he had exchanged his slippers for his shoes; and as keen in all his\nsenses as though years could never tell upon him.\n\nHe always wore round his neck a stiff-starched deep white handkerchief,\nnot fastened with a bow in front, the ends being tucked in so as to be\ninvisible. This cravat not only covered his throat but his chin also, so\nthat his head seemed to grow forth from it without the aid of any neck;\nand he had a trick of turning his face round within it, an inch or two\nto the right or to the left, in a manner which seemed to indicate that\nhis cranium was loose and might be removed at pleasure.\n\nHe shuffled into the room where Charley was standing with little\nshort quick steps, and putting out his hand, just touched that of his\ncustomer, by way of going through the usual process of greeting.\n\nSome short statement must be made of Charley's money dealings with Mr.\nM'Ruen up to this period. About two years back a tailor had an over-due\nbill of his for \u00c2\u00a320, of which he was unable to obtain payment, and being\nunwilling to go to law, or perhaps being himself in Mr. M'Ruen's\npower, he passed this bill to that worthy gentleman--what amount of\nconsideration he got for it, it matters not now to inquire; Mr. M'Ruen\nvery shortly afterwards presented himself at the Internal Navigation,\nand introduced himself to our hero. He did this with none of the\noverbearing harshness of the ordinary dun, or the short caustic decision\nof a creditor determined to resort to the utmost severity of the law.\nHe turned his head about and smiled, and just showed the end of the\nbill peeping out from among a parcel of others, begged Mr. Tudor to be\npunctual, he would only ask him to be punctual, and would in such case\ndo anything for him, and ended his visit by making an appointment to\nmeet Charley in the little street behind Mecklenburg Square.\nCharley kept his appointment, and came away from Mr. M'Ruen's with a\nwell-contented mind. He had, it is true, left \u00c2\u00a35 behind him, and had\nalso left the bill, still entire; but he had obtained a promise of\nunlimited assistance from the good-natured gentleman, and had also\nreceived instructions how he was to get a brother clerk to draw a bill,\nhow he was to accept it himself, and how his patron was to discount it\nfor him, paying him real gold out of the Bank of England in exchange for\nhis worthless signature.\n\nCharley stepped lighter on the ground as he left Mr. M'Ruen's house\non that eventful morning than he had done for many a day. There was\nsomething delightful in the feeling that he could make money of his name\nin this way, as great bankers do of theirs, by putting it at the bottom\nof a scrap of paper. He experienced a sort of pride too in having\nachieved so respectable a position in the race of ruin which he was\nrunning, as to have dealings with a bill-discounter. He felt that he was\nputting himself on a par with great men, and rising above the low level\nof the infernal navvies. Mr. M'Ruen had pulled the bill out of a heap\nof bills which he always carried in his huge pocket-book, and showed to\nCharley the name of an impoverished Irish peer on the back of it; and\nthe sight of that name had made Charley quite in love with rum.\nHe already felt that he was almost hand-and-glove with Lord\nMount-Coffeehouse; for it was a descendant of the nobleman so celebrated\nin song. 'Only be punctual, Mr. Tudor; only be punctual, and I will\ndo anything for you,' Mr. M'Ruen had said, as Charley left the house.\nCharley, however, never had been punctual, and yet his dealings with\nMr. M'Ruen had gone on from that day to this. What absolute money he had\never received into his hand he could not now have said, but it was very\nlittle, probably not amounting in all to \u00c2\u00a350. Yet he had already paid\nduring the two years more than double that sum to this sharp-clawed\nvulture, and still owed him the amounts of more bills than he could\nnumber. Indeed he had kept no account of these double-fanged little\ndocuments; he had signed them whenever told to do so, and had even been\nso preposterously foolish as to sign them in blank. All he knew was that\nat the beginning of every quarter Mr. M'Ruen got nearly the half of his\nlittle modicum of salary, and that towards the middle of it he usually\ncontrived to obtain an advance of some small, some very small sum, and\nthat when doing so he always put his hand to a fresh bit of paper.\n\nHe was beginning to be heartily sick of the bill-discounter. His\nintimacy with the lord had not yet commenced, nor had he experienced any\nof the delights which he had expected to accrue to him from the higher\ntone of extravagance in which he entered when he made Mr. M'Ruen's\nacquaintance. And then the horrid fatal waste of time which he incurred\nin pursuit of the few pounds which he occasionally obtained, filled even\nhis heart with a sort of despair. Morning after morning he would wait in\nthat hated room; and then day after day, at two o'clock, he would attend\nthe usurer's city haunt--and generally all in vain. The patience of Mr.\nSnape was giving way, and the discipline even of the Internal Navigation\nfelt itself outraged.\n\nAnd now Charley stood once more in that dingy little front parlour in\nwhich he had never yet seen a fire, and once more Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen\nshuffled into the room in his big cravat and dirty loose slippers.\n\n'How d'ye do, Mr. Tudor, how d'ye do? I hope you have brought a little\nof this with you;' and Jabesh opened out his left hand, and tapped the\npalm of it with the middle finger of his right, by way of showing that\nhe expected some money: not that he did expect any, cormorant that he\nwas; this was not the period of the quarter in which he ever got money\nfrom his customer.\n\n'Indeed I have not, Mr. M'Ruen; but I positively must get some.'\n\n'Oh--oh--oh--oh--Mr. Tudor--Mr. Tudor! How can we go on if you are\nso unpunctual? Now I would do anything for you if you would only be\npunctual.'\n\n'Oh! bother about that--you know your own game well enough.'\n\n'Be punctual, Mr. Tudor, only be punctual, and we shall be all\nright--and so you have not got any of this?' and Jabesh went through the\ntapping again.\n\n'Not a doit,' said Charley; 'but I shall be up the spout altogether if\nyou don't do something to help me.'\n\n'But you are so unpunctual, Mr. Tudor.'\n\n'Oh, d---- it; you'll make me sick if you say that again. What else do\nyou live by but that? But I positively must have some money from you\nto-day. If not I am done for.'\n\n'I don't think I can, Mr. Tudor; not to-day, Mr. Tudor--some other day,\nsay this day month; that is, if you'll be punctual.'\n\n'This day month! no, but this very day, Mr. M'Ruen--why, you got \u00c2\u00a318\nfrom me when I received my last salary, and I have not had a shilling\nback since.'\n\n'But you are so unpunctual, Mr. Tudor,' and Jabesh twisted his head\nbackwards and forwards within his cravat, rubbing his chin with the\ninterior starch.\n\n'Well, then, I'll tell you what it is,' said Charley, 'I'll be shot if\nyou get a shilling from me on the 1st of October, and you may sell me up\nas quick as you please. If I don't give a history of your business that\nwill surprise some people, my name isn't Tudor.'\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mr. M'Ruen, with a soft quiet laugh.\n\n'Well, really, Mr. Tudor, I would do more for you than any other young\nman that I know, if you were only a little more punctual. How much is it\nyou want now?'\n\n'\u00c2\u00a315--or \u00c2\u00a310--\u00c2\u00a310 will do.'\n\n'Ten pounds!' said Jabesh, as though Charley had asked for ten\nthousand--'ten pounds!--if two or three would do--'\n\n'But two or three won't do.'\n\n'And whose name will you bring?'\n\n'Whose name! why Scatterall's, to be sure.' Now Scatterall was one of\nthe navvies; and from him Mr. M'Ruen had not yet succeeded in extracting\none farthing, though he had his name on a volume of Charley's bills.\n\n'Scatterall--I don't like Mr. Scatterall,' said Jabesh; 'he is very\ndissipated, and the most unpunctual young man I ever met--you really\nmust get some one else, Mr. Tudor; you really must.'\n\n'Oh, that's nonsense--Scatterall is as good as anybody--I couldn't ask\nany of the other fellows--they are such a low set.'\n\n'But Mr. Scatterall is so unpunctual. There's your cousin, Mr. Alaric\nTudor.'\n\n'My cousin Alaric! Oh, nonsense! you don't suppose I'd ask him to do\nsuch a thing? You might as well tell me to go to my father.'\n\n'Or that other gentleman you live with; Mr. Norman. He is a most\npunctual gentleman. Bring me his name, and I'll let you have \u00c2\u00a310 or\n\u00c2\u00a38--I'll let you have \u00c2\u00a38 at once.'\n\n'I dare say you will, Mr. M'Ruen, or \u00c2\u00a380; and be only too happy to give\nit me. But you know that is out of the question. Now I won't wait any\nlonger; just give me an answer to this: if I come to you in the city\nwill you let me have some money to-day? If you won't, why I must go\nelsewhere--that's all.'\n\nThe interview ended by an appointment being made for another meeting to\ncome off at two p.m. that day, at the 'Banks of Jordan,' a public-house\nin Sweeting's Alley, as well known to Charley as the little front\nparlour of Mr. M'Ruen's house. 'Bring the bill-stamp with you, Mr.\nTudor,' said Jabesh, by way of a last parting word of counsel; 'and let\nMr. Scatterall sign it--that is, if it must be Mr. Scatterall; but I\nwish you would bring your cousin's name.'\n\n'Nonsense!'\n\n'Well, then, bring it signed--but I'll fill it; you young fellows\nunderstand nothing of filling in a bill properly.'\n\nAnd then taking his leave the infernal navvy hurried off, and reached\nhis office in Somerset House at a quarter past eleven o'clock. As he\nwalked along he bought the bit of stamped paper on which his friend\nScatterall was to write his name.\n\nWhen he reached the office he found that a great commotion was going on.\nMr. Snape was standing up at his desk, and the first word which greeted\nCharley's ears was an intimation from that gentleman that Mr. Oldeschole\nhad desired that Mr. Tudor, when he arrived, should be instructed to\nattend in the board-room.\n\n'Very well,' said Charley, in a tone of great indifference, 'with all my\nheart; I rather like seeing Oldeschole now and then. But he mustn't keep\nme long, for I have to meet my grandmother at Islington at two o'clock;'\nand Charley, having hung up his hat, prepared to walk off to the\nSecretary's room.\n\n'You'll be good enough to wait a few minutes, Mr. Tudor,' said Snape.\n'Another gentleman is with Mr. Oldeschole at present. You will be good\nenough to sit down and go on with the Kennett and Avon lock entries,\ntill Mr. Oldeschole is ready to see you.'\n\nCharley sat down at his desk opposite to his friend Scatterall. 'I hope,\nMr. Snape, you had a pleasant meeting at evening prayers yesterday,'\nsaid he, with a tone of extreme interest.\n\n'You had better mind the lock entries at present, Mr. Tudor; they are\ngreatly in arrear.'\n\n'And the evening meetings are docketed up as close as wax, I suppose.\nWhat the deuce is in the wind, Dick?' Mr. Scatterall's Christian name\nwas Richard. 'Where's Corkscrew?' Mr. Corkscrew was also a navvy, and\nwas one of those to whom Charley had specially alluded when he spoke of\nthe low set.\n\n'Oh, here's a regular go,' said Scatterall. 'It's all up with Corkscrew,\nI believe.'\n\n'Why, what's the cheese now?'\n\n'Oh! it's all about some pork chops, which Screwy had for supper last\nnight.' Screwy was a name of love which among his brother navvies was\ngiven to Mr. Corkscrew. 'Mr. Snape seems to think they did not agree\nwith him.'\n\n'Pork chops in July!' exclaimed Charley.\n\n'Poor Screwy forgot the time of year,' said another navvy; 'he ought to\nhave called it lamb and grass.'\n\nAnd then the story was told. On the preceding afternoon, Mr. Corkscrew\nhad been subjected to the dire temptation of a boating party to the\nEel-pie Island for the following day, and a dinner thereon. There were\nto be at the feast no less than four-and-twenty jolly souls, and it was\nintimated to Mr. Corkscrew that as no soul was esteemed to be more jolly\nthan his own, the party would be considered as very imperfect unless he\ncould join it. Asking for a day's leave Mr. Corkscrew knew to be out\nof the question; he had already taken too many without asking. He was\ntherefore driven to take another in the same way, and had to look about\nfor some excuse which might support him in his difficulty. An excuse it\nmust be, not only new, but very valid; one so strong that it could\nnot be overset; one so well avouched that it could not be doubted.\nAccordingly, after mature consideration, he sat down after leaving his\noffice, and wrote the following letter, before he started on an evening\ncruising expedition with some others of the party to prepare for the\nnext day's festivities.\n\n'Thursday morning,--July, 185-.\n\n'MY DEAR SIR,\n\n'I write from my bed where I am suffering a most tremendous\nindiggestion, last night I eat a stunning supper off pork chopps and\nnever remembered that pork chopps always does disagree with me, but I\nwas very indiscrete and am now teetotally unable to rise my throbing\nhead from off my pillar, I have took four blu pills and some salts and\nsena, plenty of that, and shall be the thing to-morrow morning no\ndoubt, just at present I feel just as if I had a mill stone inside my\nstomac--Pray be so kind as to make it all right with Mr. Oldeschole and\nbelieve me to remain,\n\n'Your faithful and obedient servant,\n\n'VERAX CORKSCREW.\n\n'Thomas Snape, Esq., &c.,\n\n'Internal Navigation Office, Somerset House.'\n\nHaving composed this letter of excuse, and not intending to return\nto his lodgings that evening, he had to make provision for its safely\nreaching the hands of Mr. Snape in due time on the following morning.\nThis he did, by giving it to the boy who came to clean the lodging-house\nboots, with sundry injunctions that if he did not deliver it at the\noffice by ten o'clock on the following morning, the sixpence accruing to\nhim would never be paid. Mr. Corkscrew, however, said nothing as to the\nletter not being delivered before ten the next morning, and as other\nbusiness took the boy along the Strand the same evening, he saw no\nreason why he should not then execute his commission. He accordingly did\nso, and duly delivered the letter into the hands of a servant girl, who\nwas cleaning the passages of the office.\n\nFortune on this occasion was blind to the merits of Mr. Corkscrew, and\nthrew him over most unmercifully. It so happened that Mr. Snape had\nbeen summoned to an evening conference with Mr. Oldeschole and the\nother pundits of the office, to discuss with them, or rather to hear\ndiscussed, some measure which they began to think it necessary to\nintroduce, for amending the discipline of the department.\n\n'We are getting a bad name, whether we deserve it or not,' said Mr.\nOldeschole. 'That fellow Hardlines has put us into his blue-book, and\nnow there's an article in the _Times_!'\n\nJust at this moment, a messenger brought in to Mr. Snape the unfortunate\nletter of which we have given a copy.\n\n'What's that?' said Mr. Oldeschole.\n\n'A note from Mr. Corkscrew, sir,' said Snape.\n\n'He's the worst of the whole lot,' said Mr. Oldeschole.\n\n'He is very bad,' said Snape; 'but I rather think that perhaps, sir, Mr.\nTudor is the worst of all.'\n\n'Well, I don't know,' said the Secretary, muttering _sotto voce_ to the\nUnder-Secretary, while Mr. Snape read the letter--'Tudor, at any rate,\nis a gentleman.'\n\nMr. Snape read the letter, and his face grew very long. There was a sort\nof sneaking civility about Corkscrew, not prevalent indeed at all\ntimes, but which chiefly showed itself when he and Mr. Snape were alone\ntogether, which somewhat endeared him to the elder clerk. He would have\nscreened the sinner had he had either the necessary presence of mind or\nthe necessary pluck. But he had neither. He did not know how to account\nfor the letter but by the truth, and he feared to conceal so flagrant a\nbreach of discipline at the moment of the present discussion.\n\nThings at any rate so turned out that Mr. Corkscrew's letter was read in\nfull conclave in the board-room of the office, just as he was describing\nthe excellence of his manoeuvre with great glee to four or five other\njolly souls at the 'Magpie and Stump.'\n\nAt first it was impossible to prevent a fit of laughter, in which even\nMr. Snape joined; but very shortly the laughter gave way to the serious\nconsiderations to which such an epistle was sure to give rise at such a\nmoment. What if Sir Gregory Hardlines should get hold of it and put it\ninto his blue-book! What if the _Times_ should print it and send it over\nthe whole world, accompanied by a few of its most venomous touches,\nto the eternal disgrace of the Internal Navigation, and probably utter\nannihilation of Mr. Oldeschole's official career! An example must be\nmade!\n\nYes, an example must be made. Messengers were sent off scouring the town\nfor Mr. Corkscrew, and about midnight he was found, still true to the\n'Magpie and Stump,' but hardly in condition to understand the misfortune\nwhich had befallen him. So much as this, however, did make itself\nmanifest to him, that he must by no means join his jolly-souled brethren\nat the Eel-pie Island, and that he must be at his office punctually at\nten o'clock the next morning if he had any intention of saving himself\nfrom dismissal. When Charley arrived at his office, Mr. Corkscrew was\nstill with the authorities, and Charley's turn was to come next.\n\nCharley was rather a favourite with Mr. Oldeschole, having been\nappointed by himself at the instance of Mr. Oldeschole's great friend,\nSir Gilbert de Salop; and he was, moreover, the best-looking of the\nwhole lot of navvies; but he was no favourite with Mr. Snape.\n\n'Poor Screwy--it will be all up with him,' said Charley. 'He might just\nas well have gone on with his party and had his fun out.'\n\n'It will, I imagine, be necessary to make more than one example, Mr.\nTudor,' said Mr. Snape, with a voice of utmost severity.\n\n'A-a-a-men,' said Charley. 'If everything else fails, I think I'll go\ninto the green line. You couldn't give me a helping hand, could you, Mr.\nSnape?' There was a rumour afloat in the office that Mr. Snape's wife\nheld some little interest in a small greengrocer's establishment.\n\n'Mr. Tudor to attend in the board-room, immediately,' said a fat\nmessenger, who opened the door wide with a start, and then stood with it\nin his hand while he delivered the message.\n\n'All right,' said Charley; 'I'll tumble up and be with them in ten\nseconds;' and then collecting together a large bundle of the arrears of\nthe Kennett and Avon lock entries, being just as much as he could carry,\nhe took the disordered papers and placed them on Mr. Snape's desk,\nexactly over the paper on which he was writing, and immediately under\nhis nose.\n\n'Mr. Tudor--Mr. Tudor!' said Snape.\n\n'As I am to tear myself away from you, Mr. Snape, it is better that I\nshould hand over these valuable documents to your safe keeping. There\nthey are, Mr. Snape; pray see that you have got them all;' and\nso saying, he left the room to attend to the high behests of Mr.\nOldeschole.\n\nAs he went along the passages he met Verax Corkscrew returning from his\ninterview. 'Well, Screwy,' said he, 'and how fares it with you? Pork\nchops are bad things in summer, ain't they?'\n\n'It's all U-P,' said Corkscrew, almost crying. 'I'm to go down to the\nbottom, and I'm to stay at the office till seven o'clock every day for\na month; and old Foolscap says he'll ship me the next time I'm absent\nhalf-an-hour without leave.'\n\n'Oh! is that all?' said Charley. 'If that's all you get for pork chops\nand senna, I'm all right. I shouldn't wonder if I did not get promoted;'\nand so he went in to his interview.\n\nWhat was the nature of the advice given him, what amount of caution he\nwas called on to endure, need not here be exactly specified. We all know\nwith how light a rod a father chastises the son he loves, let Solomon\nhave given what counsel he may to the contrary. Charley, in spite of his\nmanifold sins, was a favourite, and he came forth from the board-room an\nunscathed man. In fact, he had been promoted as he had surmised, seeing\nthat Corkscrew who had been his senior was now his junior. He came forth\nunscathed, and walking with an easy air into his room, put his hat on\nhis head and told his brother clerks that he should be there to-morrow\nmorning at ten, or at any rate soon after.\n\n'And where are you going now, Mr. Tudor?' said Snape.\n\n'To meet my grandmother at Islington, if you please, sir,' said Charley.\n'I have permission from Mr. Oldeschole to attend upon her for the rest\nof the day--perhaps you would like to ask him.' And so saying he went\noff to his appointment with Mr. M'Ruen at the 'Banks of Jordan.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES.--AFTERNOON\n\n\nThe 'Banks of Jordan' was a public-house in the city, which from its\nappearance did not seem to do a very thriving trade; but as it was\ncarried on from year to year in the same dull, monotonous, dead-alive\nsort of fashion, it must be surmised that some one found an interest in\nkeeping it open.\n\nCharley, when he entered the door punctually at two o'clock, saw that it\nwas as usual nearly deserted. One long, lanky, middle-aged man, seedy as\nto his outward vestments, and melancholy in countenance, sat at one of\nthe tables. But he was doing very little good for the establishment:\nhe had no refreshment of any kind before him, and was intent only on a\ndingy pocket-book in which he was making entries with a pencil.\n\nYou enter the 'Banks of Jordan' by two folding doors in a corner of a\nvery narrow alley behind the Exchange. As you go in, you observe on\nyour left a little glass partition, something like a large cage, inside\nwhich, in a bar, are four or five untempting-looking bottles; and also\ninside the cage, on a chair, is to be seen a quiet-looking female, who\nis invariably engaged in the manufacture of some white article of inward\nclothing. Anything less like the flashy-dressed bar-maidens of the\nwestern gin palaces it would be difficult to imagine. To this encaged\nsempstress no one ever speaks unless it be to give a rare order for a\nmutton chop or pint of stout. And even for this she hardly stays her\nsewing for a moment, but touches a small bell, and the ancient waiter,\nwho never shows himself but when called for, and who is the only other\ninhabitant of the place ever visible, receives the order from her\nthrough an open pane in the cage as quietly as she received it from her\ncustomer.\n\nThe floor of the single square room of the establishment is sanded, and\nthe tables are ranged round the walls, each table being fixed to the\nfloor, and placed within wooden partitions, by which the occupier is\nscreened from any inquiring eyes on either side.\n\nSuch was Mr. Jabesh M'Ruen's house-of-call in the city, and of many a\nmutton chop and many a pint of stout had Charley partaken there while\nwaiting for the man of money. To him it seemed to be inexcusable to sit\ndown in a public inn and call for nothing; he perceived, however,\nthat the large majority of the frequenters of the 'Banks of Jordan' so\nconducted themselves.\n\nHe was sufficiently accustomed to the place to know how to give his\norders without troubling that diligent barmaid, and had done so about\nten minutes when Jabesh, more punctual than usual, entered the place.\nThis Charley regarded as a promising sign of forthcoming cash. It very\nfrequently happened that he waited there an hour, and that after all\nJabesh would not come; and then the morning visit to Mecklenburg Square\nhad to be made again; and so poor Charley's time, or rather the time of\nhis poor office, was cut up, wasted, and destroyed.\n\n'A mutton chop!' said Mr. M'Ruen, looking at Charley's banquet. 'A very\nnice thing indeed in the middle of the day. I don't mind if I have one\nmyself,' and so Charley had to order another chop and more stout.\n\n'They have very nice sherry here, excellent sherry,' said M'Ruen. 'The\nbest, I think, in the city--that's why I come here.'\n\n'Upon my honour, Mr. M'Ruen, I shan't have money to pay for it until I\nget some from you,' said Charley, as he called for a pint of sherry.\n\n'Never mind, John, never mind the sherry to-day,' said M'Ruen. 'Mr.\nTudor is very kind, but I'll take beer;' and the little man gave a laugh\nand twisted his head, and ate his chop and drank his stout, as though\nhe found that both were very good indeed. When he had finished, Charley\npaid the bill and discovered that he was left with ninepence in his\npocket.\n\nAnd then he produced the bill stamp. 'Waiter,' said he, 'pen and ink,'\nand the waiter brought pen and ink.\n\n'Not to-day,' said Jabesh, wiping his mouth with the table-cloth. 'Not\nto-day, Mr. Tudor--I really haven't time to go into it to-day--and I\nhaven't brought the other bills with me; I quite forgot to bring the\nother bills with me, and I can do nothing without them,' and Mr. M'Ruen\ngot up to go.\n\nBut this was too much for Charley. He had often before bought bill\nstamps in vain, and in vain had paid for mutton chops and beer for Mr.\nM'Ruen's dinner; but he had never before, when doing so, been so hard\npushed for money as he was now. He was determined to make a great\nattempt to gain his object.\n\n'Nonsense,' said he, getting up and standing so as to prevent M'Ruen\nfrom leaving the box; 'that's d---- nonsense.'\n\n'Oh! don't swear,' said M'Ruen--'pray don't take God's name in vain; I\ndon't like it.'\n\n'I shall swear, and to some purpose too, if that's your game. Now look\nhere----'\n\n'Let me get up, and we'll talk of it as we go to the bank--you are so\nunpunctual, you know.'\n\n'D---- your punctuality.'\n\n'Oh! don't swear, Mr. Tudor.'\n\n'Look here--if you don't let me have this money to-day, by all that is\nholy I will never pay you a farthing again--not one farthing; I'll go\ninto the court, and you may get your money as you can.'\n\n'But, Mr. Tudor, let me get up, and we'll talk about it in the street,\nas we go along.'\n\n'There's the stamp,' said Charley. 'Fill it up, and then I'll go with\nyou to the bank.'\n\nM'Ruen took the bit of paper, and twisted it over and over again in his\nhand, considering the while whether he had yet squeezed out of the young\nman all that could be squeezed with safety, or whether by an additional\nturn, by giving him another small advancement, he might yet get\nsomething more. He knew that Tudor was in a very bad state, that he was\ntottering on the outside edge of the precipice; but he also knew that\nhe had friends. Would his friends when they came forward to assist their\nyoung Pickle out of the mire, would they pay such bills as these or\nwould they leave poor Jabesh to get his remedy at law? That was the\nquestion which Mr. M'Ruen had to ask and to answer. He was not one of\nthose noble vultures who fly at large game, and who are willing to run\nconsiderable risk in pursuit of their prey. Mr. M'Ruen avoided courts of\nlaw as much as he could, and preferred a small safe trade; one in which\nthe fall of a single customer could never be ruinous to him; in which\nhe need run no risk of being transported for forgery, incarcerated for\nperjury, or even, if possibly it might be avoided, gibbeted by some\nlawyer or judge for his malpractices.\n\n'But you are so unpunctual,' he said, having at last made up his mind\nthat he had made a very good thing of Charley, and that probably he\nmight go a _little_ further without much danger. 'I wish to oblige you,\nMr. Tudor; but pray do be punctual;' and so saying he slowly spread the\nlittle document before him, across which Scatterall had already scrawled\nhis name, and slowly began to write in the date. Slowly, with his head\nlow down over the table, and continually twisting it inside his cravat,\nhe filled up the paper, and then looking at it with the air of a\nconnoisseur in such matters, he gave it to Charley to sign.\n\n'But you haven't put in the amount,' said Charley.\n\nMr. M'Ruen twisted his head and laughed. He delighted in playing with\nhis game as a fisherman does with a salmon. 'Well--no--I haven't put in\nthe amount yet. Do you sign it, and I'll do that at once.'\n\n'I'll do it,' said Charley; 'I'll say \u00c2\u00a315, and you'll give me \u00c2\u00a310 on\nthat.'\n\n'No, no, no!' said Jabesh, covering the paper over with his hands; 'you\nyoung men know nothing of filling bills; just sign it, Mr. Tudor, and\nI'll do the rest.' And so Charley signed it, and then M'Ruen, again\ntaking the pen, wrote in 'fifteen pounds' as the recognized amount of\nthe value of the document. He also took out his pocket-book and filled\na cheque, but he was very careful that Charley should not see the amount\nthere written. 'And now,' said he, 'we will go to the bank.'\n\nAs they made their way to the house in Lombard Street which Mr. M'Ruen\nhonoured by his account, Charley insisted on knowing how much he was to\nhave for the bill. Jabesh suggested \u00c2\u00a33 10s.; Charley swore he would take\nnothing less than \u00c2\u00a38; but by the time they had arrived at the bank, it\nhad been settled that \u00c2\u00a35 was to be paid in cash, and that Charley was\nto have the three Seasons for the balance whenever he chose to send for\nthem. When Charley, as he did at first, positively refused to accede\nto these terms, Mr. M'Ruen tendered him back the bill, and reminded\nhim with a plaintive voice that he was so unpunctual, so extremely\nunpunctual.\n\nHaving reached the bank, which the money-lender insisted on Charley\nentering with him, Mr. M'Ruen gave the cheque across the counter, and\nwrote on the back of it the form in which he would take the money,\nwhereupon a note and five sovereigns were handed to him. The cheque\nwas for \u00c2\u00a315, and was payable to C. Tudor, Esq., so that proof might be\nforthcoming at a future time, if necessary, that he had given to his\ncustomer full value for the bill. Then in the outer hall of the bank,\nunseen by the clerks, he put, one after another, slowly and unwillingly,\nfour sovereigns into Charley's hand.\n\n'The other--where's the other?' said Charley.\n\nJabesh smiled sweetly and twisted his head.\n\n'Come, give me the other,' said Charley roughly.\n\n'Four is quite enough, quite enough for what you want; and remember my\ntime, Mr. Tudor; you should remember my time.'\n\n'Give me the other sovereign,' said Charley, taking hold of the front of\nhis coat.\n\n'Well, well, you shall have ten shillings; but I want the rest for a\npurpose.'\n\n'Give me the sovereign,' said Charley, 'or I'll drag you in before them\nall in the bank and expose you; give me the other sovereign, I say.'\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mr. M'Ruen; 'I thought you liked a joke, Mr.\nTudor. Well, here it is. And now do be punctual, pray do be punctual,\nand I'll do anything I can for you.'\n\nAnd then they parted, Charley going westward towards his own haunts, and\nM'Ruen following his daily pursuits in the city.\n\nCharley had engaged to pull up to Avis's at Putney with Harry Norman,\nto dine there, take a country walk, and row back in the cool of the\nevening; and he had promised to call at the Weights and Measures with\nthat object punctually at five.\n\n'You can get away in time for that, I suppose,' said Harry.\n\n'Well, I'll try and manage it,' said Charley, laughing.\n\nNothing could be kinder, nay, more affectionate, than Norman had been to\nhis fellow-lodger during the last year and a half. It seemed as though\nhe had transferred to Alaric's cousin all the friendship which he had\nonce felt for Alaric; and the deeper were Charley's sins of idleness and\nextravagance, the wider grew Norman's forgiveness, and the more sincere\nhis efforts to befriend him. As one result of this, Charley was already\ndeep in his debt. Not that Norman had lent him money, or even paid bills\nfor him; but the lodgings in which they lived had been taken by Norman,\nand when the end of the quarter came he punctually paid his landlady.\n\nCharley had once, a few weeks before the period of which we are now\nwriting, told Norman that he had no money to pay his long arrear, and\nthat he would leave the lodgings and shift for himself as best he could.\nHe had said the same thing to Mrs. Richards, the landlady, and had gone\nso far as to pack up all his clothes; but his back was no sooner turned\nthan Mrs. Richards, under Norman's orders, unpacked them all, and hid\naway the portmanteau. It was well for him that this was done. He had\nbespoken for himself a bedroom at the public-house in Norfolk Street,\nand had he once taken up his residence there he would have been ruined\nfor ever.\n\nHe was still living with Norman, and ever increasing his debt. In his\nmisery at this state of affairs, he had talked over with Harry all\nmanner of schemes for increasing his income, but he had never told him\na word about Mr. M'Ruen. Why his salary, which was now \u00c2\u00a3150 per annum,\nshould not be able to support him, Norman never asked. Charley the while\nwas very miserable, and the more miserable he was, the less he found\nhimself able to rescue himself from his dissipation. What moments of\nease he had were nearly all spent in Norfolk Street; and such being the\ncase how could he abstain from going there?\n\n'Well, Charley, and how do 'Crinoline and Macassar' go on?' said Norman,\nas they sauntered away together up the towing-path above Putney. Now\nthere were those who had found out that Charley Tudor, in spite of his\nwretched, idle, vagabond mode of life, was no fool; indeed, that there\nwas that talent within him which, if turned to good account, might\nperhaps redeem him from ruin and set him on his legs again; at least\nso thought some of his friends, among whom Mrs. Woodward was the most\nprominent. She insisted that if he would make use of his genius he\nmight employ his spare time to great profit by writing for magazines or\nperiodicals; and, inspirited by so flattering a proposition, Charley had\ngot himself introduced to the editor of a newly-projected publication.\nAt his instance he was to write a tale for approval, and 'Crinoline and\nMacassar' was the name selected for his first attempt.\n\nThe affair had been fully talked over at Hampton, and it had been\narranged that the young author should submit his story, when completed,\nto the friendly criticism of the party assembled at Surbiton Cottage,\nbefore he sent it to the editor. He had undertaken to have 'Crinoline\nand Macassar' ready for perusal on the next Saturday, and in spite of\nMr. M'Ruen and Norah Geraghty, he had really been at work.\n\n'Will it be finished by Saturday, Charley?' said Norman.\n\n'Yes--at least I hope so; but if that's not done, I have another all\ncomplete.'\n\n'Another! and what is that called?'\n\n'Oh, that's a very short one,' said Charley, modestly.\n\n'But, short as it is, it must have a name, I suppose. What's the name of\nthe short one?'\n\n'Why, the name is long enough; it's the longest part about it. The\neditor gave me the name, you know, and then I had to write the\nstory. It's to be called \"Sir Anthony Allan-a-dale and the Baron of\nBallyporeen.\"'\n\n'Oh! two rival knights in love with the same lady, of course,' and Harry\ngave a gentle sigh as he thought of his own still unhealed grief. 'The\nscene is laid in Ireland, I presume?'\n\n'No, not in Ireland; at least not exactly. I don't think the scene is\nlaid anywhere in particular; it's up in a mountain, near a castle. There\nisn't any lady in it--at least, not alive.'\n\n'Heavens, Charley! I hope you are not dealing with dead women.'\n\n'No--that is, I have to bring them to life again. I'll tell you how it\nis. In the first paragraph, Sir Anthony Allan-a-dale is lying dead, and\nthe Baron of Ballyporeen is standing over him with a bloody sword. You\nmust always begin with an incident now, and then hark back for your\nexplanation and description; that's what the editor says is the great\nsecret of the present day, and where we beat all the old fellows that\nwrote twenty years ago.'\n\n'Oh!--yes--I see. They used to begin at the beginning; that was very\nhumdrum.'\n\n'A devilish bore, you know, for a fellow who takes up a novel because\nhe's dull. Of course he wants his fun at once. If you begin with a long\nhistory of who's who and all that, why he won't read three pages; but if\nyou touch him up with a startling incident or two at the first go off,\nthen give him a chapter of horrors, then another of fun, then a little\nlove or a little slang, or something of that sort, why, you know, about\nthe end of the first volume, you may describe as much as you like, and\ntell everything about everybody's father and mother for just as many\npages as you want to fill. At least that's what the editor says.'\n\n'_Meleager ab ovo_ may be introduced with safety when you get as far as\nthat,' suggested Norman.\n\n'Yes, you may bring him in too, if you like,' said Charley, who was\nsomewhat oblivious of his classicalities. 'Well, Sir Anthony is lying\ndead and the Baron is standing over him, when out come Sir Anthony's\nretainers----'\n\n'Out--out of what?'\n\n'Out of the castle: that's all explained afterwards. Out come the\nretainers, and pitch into the Baron till they make mincemeat of him.'\n\n'They don't kill him, too?'\n\n'Don't they though? I rather think they do, and no mistake.'\n\n'And so both your heroes are dead in the first chapter.'\n\n'First chapter! why that's only the second paragraph. I'm only to be\nallowed ten paragraphs for each number, and I am expected to have an\nincident for every other paragraph for the first four days.'\n\n'That's twenty incidents.'\n\n'Yes--it's a great bother finding so many.--I'm obliged to make the\nretainers come by all manner of accidents; and I should never have\nfinished the job if I hadn't thought of setting the castle on fire. 'And\nnow forked tongues of liquid fire, and greedy lambent flames burst forth\nfrom every window of the devoted edifice. The devouring element----.'\nThat's the best passage in the whole affair.'\n\n'This is for the _Daily Delight_, isn't it?'\n\n'Yes, for the _Daily Delight_. It is to begin on the 1st of September\nwith the partridges. We expect a most tremendous sale. It will be the\nfirst halfpenny publication in the market, and as the retailers will get\nthem for sixpence a score--twenty-four to the score--they'll go off like\nwildfire.'\n\n'Well, Charley, and what do you do with the dead bodies of your two\nheroes?'\n\n'Of course I needn't tell you that it was not the Baron who killed Sir\nAnthony at all.'\n\n'Oh! wasn't it? O dear--that was a dreadful mistake on the part of the\nretainers.'\n\n'But as natural as life. You see these two grandees were next-door\nneighbours, and there had been a feud between the families for seven\ncenturies--a sort of Capulet and Montague affair. One Adelgitha, the\ndaughter of the Thane of Allan-a-dale--there were Thanes in those\ndays, you know--was betrothed to the eldest son of Sir Waldemar de\nBallyporeen. This gives me an opportunity of bringing in a succinct\nlittle account of the Conquest, which will be beneficial to the lower\nclasses. The editor peremptorily insists upon that kind of thing.'\n\n'_Omne tulit punctum_,' said Norman.\n\n'Yes, I dare say,' said Charley, who was now too intent on his own new\nprofession to attend much to his friend's quotation. 'Well, where was\nI?--Oh! the eldest son of Sir Waldemar went off with another lady and so\nthe feud began. There is a very pretty scene between Adelgitha and her\nlady's-maid.'\n\n'What, seven centuries before the story begins?'\n\n'Why not? The editor says that the unities are altogether thrown over\nnow, and that they are regular bosh--our game is to stick in a good bit\nwhenever we can get it--I got to be so fond of Adelgitha that I rather\nthink she's the heroine.'\n\n'But doesn't that take off the interest from your dead grandees?'\n\n'Not a bit; I take it chapter and chapter about. Well, you see, the\nretainers had no sooner made mincemeat of the Baron--a very elegant\nyoung man was the Baron, just returned from the Continent, where he had\nlearnt to throw aside all prejudices about family feuds and everything\nelse, and he had just come over in a friendly way, to say as much to Sir\nAnthony, when, as he crossed the drawbridge, he stumbled over the corpse\nof his ancient enemy--well, the retainers had no sooner made mincemeat\nof him, than they perceived that Sir Anthony was lying with an open\nbottle in his hand, and that he had taken poison.'\n\n'Having committed suicide?' asked Norman.\n\n'No, not at all. The editor says that we must always have a slap at some\nof the iniquities of the times. He gave me three or four to choose from;\nthere was the adulteration of food, and the want of education for the\npoor, and street music, and the miscellaneous sale of poisons.'\n\n'And so you chose poisons and killed the knight?'\n\n'Exactly; at least I didn't kill him, for he comes all right again after\na bit. He had gone out to get something to do him good after a hard\nnight, a Seidlitz powder, or something of that sort, and an apothecary's\napprentice had given him prussic acid in mistake.'\n\n'And how is it possible he should have come to life after taking prussic\nacid?'\n\n'Why, there I have a double rap at the trade. The prussic acid is so\nbad of its kind, that it only puts him into a kind of torpor for a week.\nThen we have the trial of the apothecary's boy; that is an excellent\nepisode, and gives me a grand hit at the absurdity of our criminal\ncode.'\n\n'Why, Charley, it seems to me that you are hitting at everything.'\n\n'Oh! ah! right and left, that's the game for us authors. The press is\nthe only _censor morum_ going now--and who so fit? Set a thief to catch\na thief, you know. Well, I have my hit at the criminal code, and then\nSir Anthony comes out of his torpor.'\n\n'But how did it come to pass that the Baron's sword was all bloody?'\n\n'Ah, there was the difficulty; I saw that at once. It was necessary to\nbring in something to be killed, you know. I thought of a stray tiger\nout of Wombwell's menagerie; but the editor says that we must not\ntrespass against the probabilities; so I have introduced a big dog. The\nBaron had come across a big dog, and seeing that the brute had a wooden\nlog tied to his throat, thought he must be mad, and so he killed him.'\n\n'And what's the end of it, Charley?'\n\n'Why, the end is rather melancholy. Sir Anthony reforms, leaves off\ndrinking, and takes to going to church everyday. He becomes a Puseyite,\nputs up a memorial window to the Baron, and reads the Tracts. At last\nhe goes over to the Pope, walks about in nasty dirty clothes all full\nof vermin, and gives over his estate to Cardinal Wiseman. Then there are\nthe retainers; they all come to grief, some one way and some another. I\ndo that for the sake of the Nemesis.'\n\n'I would not have condescended to notice them, I think,' said Norman.\n\n'Oh! I must; there must be a Nemesis. The editor specially insists on a\nNemesis.'\n\nThe conclusion of Charley's novel brought them back to the boat. Norman,\nwhen he started, had intended to employ the evening in giving good\ncounsel to his friend, and in endeavouring to arrange some scheme by\nwhich he might rescue the brand from the burning; but he had not the\nheart to be severe and sententious while Charley was full of his fun.\nIt was so much pleasanter to talk to him on the easy terms of equal\nfriendship than turn Mentor and preach a sermon.\n\n'Well, Charley,' said he, as they were walking up from the boat\nwharf--Norman to his club, and Charley towards his lodgings--from which\nroute, however, he meant to deviate as soon as ever he might be left\nalone--'well, Charley, I wish you success with all my heart; I wish you\ncould do something--I won't say to keep you out of mischief.'\n\n'I wish I could, Harry,' said Charley, thoroughly abashed; 'I wish I\ncould--indeed I wish I could--but it is so hard to go right when one has\nbegun to go wrong.'\n\n'It is hard; I know it is.'\n\n'But you never can know how hard, Harry, for you have never tried,' and\nthen they went on walking for a while in silence, side by side.\n\n'You don't know the sort of place that office of mine is,' continued\nCharley. 'You don't know the sort of fellows the men are. I hate the\nplace; I hate the men I live with. It is all so dirty, so disreputable,\nso false. I cannot conceive that any fellow put in there as young as I\nwas should ever do well afterwards.'\n\n'But at any rate you might try your best, Charley.'\n\n'Yes, I might do that still; and I know I don't; and where should I have\nbeen now, if it hadn't been for you?'\n\n'Never mind about that; I sometimes think we might have done more for\neach other if we had been more together. But remember the motto you\nsaid you'd choose, Charley--Excelsior! We can none of us mount the hill\nwithout hard labour. Remember that word, Charley--Excelsior! Remember it\nnow--now, to-night; remember how you dream of higher things, and begin\nto think of them in your waking moments also;' and so they parted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA DAY WITH ONE OF THE NAVVIES.--EVENING\n\n 'Excelsior!' said Charley to himself, as he walked on a few\nsteps towards his lodgings, having left Norman at the door of his club.\n'Remember it now--now, to-night.'\n\nYes--now is the time to remember it, if it is ever to be remembered\nto any advantage. He went on with stoic resolution to the end of the\nstreet, determined to press home and put the last touch to 'Crinoline\nand Macassar;' but as he went he thought of his interview with Mr.\nM'Ruen and of the five sovereigns still in his pocket, and altered his\ncourse.\n\nCharley had not been so resolute with the usurer, so determined to get\n\u00c2\u00a35 from him on this special day, without a special object in view. His\ncredit was at stake in a more than ordinary manner; he had about a week\nsince borrowed money from the woman who kept the public-house in Norfolk\nStreet, and having borrowed it for a week only, felt that this was a\ndebt of honour which it was incumbent on him to pay. Therefore, when he\nhad walked the length of one street on his road towards his lodgings, he\nretraced his steps and made his way back to his old haunts.\n\nThe house which he frequented was hardly more like a modern London\ngin-palace than was that other house in the city which Mr. M'Ruen\nhonoured with his custom. It was one of those small tranquil shrines\nof Bacchus in which the god is worshipped perhaps with as constant a\ndevotion, though with less noisy demonstrations of zeal than in his\nlarger and more public temples. None absolutely of the lower orders\nwere encouraged to come thither for oblivion. It had about it nothing\ninviting to the general eye. No gas illuminations proclaimed its\nmidnight grandeur. No huge folding doors, one set here and another\nthere, gave ingress and egress to a wretched crowd of poverty-stricken\nmidnight revellers. No reiterated assertions in gaudy letters, each a\nfoot long, as to the peculiar merits of the old tom or Hodge's cream of\nthe valley, seduced the thirsty traveller. The panelling over the window\nbore the simple announcement, in modest letters, of the name of the\nlandlady, Mrs. Davis; and the same name appeared with equal modesty on\nthe one gas lamp opposite the door.\n\nMrs. Davis was a widow, and her customers were chiefly people who knew\nher and frequented her house regularly. Lawyers' clerks, who were either\nunmarried, or whose married homes were perhaps not so comfortable as the\nwidow's front parlour; tradesmen, not of the best sort, glad to get away\nfrom the noise of their children; young men who had begun the cares of\nlife in ambiguous positions, just on the confines of respectability, and\nwho, finding themselves too weak in flesh to cling on to the round of\nthe ladder above them, were sinking from year to year to lower steps,\nand depths even below the level of Mrs. Davis's public-house. To these\nmight be added some few of a somewhat higher rank in life, though\nperhaps of a lower rank of respectability; young men who, like Charley\nTudor and his comrades, liked their ease and self-indulgence, and were\ntoo indifferent as to the class of companions against whom they might\nrub their shoulders while seeking it.\n\nThe 'Cat and Whistle,' for such was the name of Mrs. Davis's\nestablishment, had been a house of call for the young men of the\nInternal Navigation long before Charley's time. What first gave rise to\nthe connexion it is not now easy to say; but Charley had found it, and\nhad fostered it into a close alliance, which greatly exceeded any amount\nof intimacy which existed previously to his day.\n\nIt must not be presumed that he, in an ordinary way, took his place\namong the lawyers' clerks, and general run of customers in the front\nparlour; occasionally he condescended to preside there over the quiet\nrevels, to sing a song for the guests, which was sure to be applauded to\nthe echo, and to engage in a little skirmish of politics with a retired\nlamp-maker and a silversmith's foreman from the Strand, who always\ncalled him 'Sir,' and received what he said with the greatest respect;\nbut, as a rule, he quaffed his Falernian in a little secluded parlour\nbehind the bar, in which sat the widow Davis, auditing her accounts in\nthe morning, and giving out orders in the evening to Norah Geraghty, her\nbarmaid, and to an attendant sylph, who ministered to the front parlour,\ntaking in goes of gin and screws of tobacco, and bringing out the price\nthereof with praiseworthy punctuality.\n\nLatterly, indeed, Charley had utterly deserted the front parlour; for\nthere had come there a pestilent fellow, highly connected with the\nPress, as the lamp-maker declared, but employed as an assistant\nshorthand-writer somewhere about the Houses of Parliament, according to\nthe silversmith, who greatly interfered with our navvy's authority.\nHe would not at all allow that what Charley said was law, entertained\nfearfully democratic principles of his own, and was not at all the\ngentleman. So Charley drew himself up, declined to converse any further\non politics with a man who seemed to know more about them than himself,\nand confined himself exclusively to the inner room.\n\nOn arriving at this elysium, on the night in question, he found Mrs.\nDavis usefully engaged in darning a stocking, while Scatterall sat\nopposite with a cigar in his mouth, his hat over his nose, and a glass\nof gin and water before him.\n\n'I began to think you weren't coming,' said Scatterall, 'and I was\ngetting so deuced dull that I was positively thinking of going home.'\n\n'That's very civil of you, Mr. Scatterall,' said the widow.\n\n'Well, you've been sitting there for the last half-hour without saying\na word to me; and it is dull. Looking at a woman mending stockings is\ndull, ain't it, Charley?'\n\n'That depends,' said Charley, 'partly on whom the woman may be, and\npartly on whom the man may be. Where's Norah, Mrs. Davis?'\n\n'She's not very well to-night; she has got a headache; there ain't many\nof them here to-night, so she's lying down.'\n\n'A little seedy, I suppose,' said Scatterall.\n\nCharley felt rather angry with his friend for applying such an epithet\nto his lady-love; however, he did not resent it, but sitting down,\nlighted his pipe and sipped his gin and water.\n\nAnd so they sat for the next quarter of an hour, saying very little to\neach other. What was the nature of the attraction which induced two such\nmen as Charley Tudor and Dick Scatterall to give Mrs. Davis the benefit\nof their society, while she was mending her stockings, it might be\ndifficult to explain. They could have smoked in their own rooms as well,\nand have drunk gin and water there, if they had any real predilection\nfor that mixture. Mrs. Davis was neither young nor beautiful, nor more\nthan ordinarily witty. Charley, it is true, had an allurement to entice\nhim thither, but this could not be said of Scatterall, to whom the\nlovely Norah was never more than decently civil. Had they been desired,\nin their own paternal halls, to sit and see their mother's housekeeper\ndarn the family stockings, they would, probably, both of them have\nrebelled, even though the supply of tobacco and gin and water should be\ngratuitous and unlimited.\n\nIt must be presumed that the only charm of the pursuit was in its\nacknowledged impropriety. They both understood that there was something\nfast in frequenting Mrs. Davis's inner parlour, something slow in\nremaining at home; and so they both sat there, and Mrs. Davis went on\nwith her darning-needle, nothing abashed.\n\n'Well, I think I shall go,' said Scatterall, shaking off the last ash\nfrom the end of his third cigar.\n\n'Do,' said Charley; 'you should be careful, you know; late hours will\nhurt your complexion.'\n\n'It's so deuced dull,' said Scatterall.\n\n'Why don't you go into the parlour, and have a chat with the gentlemen?'\nsuggested Mrs. Davis; 'there's Mr. Peppermint there now, lecturing about\nthe war; upon my word he talks very well.'\n\n'He's so deuced low,' said Scatterall.\n\n'He's a bumptious noisy blackguard too,' said Charley; 'he doesn't know\nhow to speak to a gentleman, when he meets one.'\n\nScatterall gave a great yawn. 'I suppose you're not going, Charley?'\nsaid he.\n\n'Oh yes, I am,' said Charley, 'in about two hours.'\n\n'Two hours! well, good night, old fellow, for I'm off. Three cigars,\nMrs. Davis, and two goes of gin and water, the last cold.' Then, having\nmade this little commercial communication to the landlady, he gave\nanother yawn, and took himself away. Mrs. Davis opened her little book,\njotted down the items, and then, having folded up her stockings, and put\nthem into a basket, prepared herself for conversation.\n\nBut, though Mrs. Davis prepared herself for conversation, she did not\nimmediately commence it. Having something special to say, she probably\nthought that she might improve her opportunity of saying it by allowing\nCharley to begin. She got up and pottered about the room, went to a\ncupboard, and wiped a couple of glasses, and then out into the bar and\narranged the jugs and pots. This done, she returned to the little room,\nand again sat herself down in her chair.\n\n'Here's your five pounds, Mrs. Davis,' said Charley; 'I wish you knew\nthe trouble I have had to get it for you.'\n\nTo give Mrs. Davis her due, this was not the subject on which she was\nanxious to speak. She would have been at present well inclined that\nCharley should remain her debtor. 'Indeed, Mr. Tudor, I am very sorry\nyou should have taken any trouble on such a trifle. If you're short of\nmoney, it will do for me just as well in October.'\n\nCharley looked at the sovereigns, and bethought himself how very short\nof cash he was. Then he thought of the fight he had had to get them, in\norder that he might pay the money which he had felt so ashamed of having\nborrowed, and he determined to resist the temptation.\n\n'Did you ever know me flush of cash? You had better take them while you\ncan get them,' and as he pushed them across the table with his stick, he\nremembered that all he had left was ninepence.\n\n'I don't want the money at present, Mr. Tudor,' said the widow. 'We're\nsuch old friends that there ought not to be a word between us about such\na trifle--now don't leave yourself bare; take what you want and settle\nwith me at quarter-day.'\n\n'Well, I'll take a sovereign,' said he, 'for to tell you the truth, I\nhave only the ghost of a shilling in my pocket.' And so it was settled;\nMrs. Davis reluctantly pocketed four of Mr. M'Ruen's sovereigns, and\nCharley kept in his own possession the fifth, as to which he had had so\nhard a combat in the lobby of the bank.\n\nHe then sat silent for a while and smoked, and Mrs. Davis again waited\nfor him to begin the subject on which she wished to speak. 'And what's\nthe matter with Norah all this time?' he said at last.\n\n'What's the matter with her?' repeated Mrs. Davis. 'Well, I think you\nmight know what's the matter with her. You don't suppose she's made of\nstone, do you?'\n\nCharley saw that he was in for it. It was in vain that Norman's last\nword was still ringing in his ears. 'Excelsior!' What had he to do with\n'Excelsior?' What miserable reptile on God's earth was more prone to\ncrawl downwards than he had shown himself to be? And then again a vision\nfloated across his mind's eye of a young sweet angel face with large\nbright eyes, with soft delicate skin, and all the exquisite charms of\ngentle birth and gentle nurture. A single soft touch seemed to press\nhis arm, a touch that he had so often felt, and had never felt without\nacknowledging to himself that there was something in it almost divine.\nAll this passed rapidly through his mind, as he was preparing to answer\nMrs. Davis's question touching Norah Geraghty.\n\n'You don't think she's made of stone, do you?' said the widow, repeating\nher words.\n\n'Indeed I don't think she's made of anything but what's suitable to a\nvery nice young woman,' said Charley.\n\n'A nice young woman! Is that all you can say for her? I call her a very\nfine girl.' Miss Golightly's friends could not say anything more, even\nfor that young lady. 'I don't know where you'll pick up a handsomer, or\na better-conducted one either, for the matter of that.'\n\n'Indeed she is,' said Charley.\n\n'Oh! for the matter of that, no one knows it better than yourself, Mr.\nTudor; and she's as well able to keep a man's house over his head as\nsome others that take a deal of pride in themselves.'\n\n'I'm quite sure of it,' said Charley.\n\n'Well, the long and the short of it is this, Mr. Tudor.' And as she\nspoke the widow got a little red in the face: she had, as Charley\nthought, an unpleasant look of resolution about her--a roundness about\nher mouth, and a sort of fierceness in her eyes. 'The long and the short\nof it is this, Mr. Tudor, what do you mean to do about the girl?'\n\n'Do about her?' said Charley, almost bewildered in his misery.\n\n'Yes, do about her. Do you mean to make her your wife? That's plain\nEnglish. Because I'll tell you what: I'll not see her put upon any\nlonger. It must be one thing or the other; and that at once. And\nif you've a grain of honour in you, Mr. Tudor--and I think you are\nhonourable--you won't back from your word with the girl now.'\n\n'Back from my word?' said Charley.\n\n'Yes, back from your word,' said Mrs. Davis, the flood-gates of whose\neloquence were now fairly opened. 'I'm sure you're too much of the\ngentleman to deny your own words, and them repeated more than once in my\npresence--Cheroots--yes, are there none there, child?--Oh, they are in\nthe cupboard.' These last words were not part of her address to Charley,\nbut were given in reply to a requisition from the attendant nymph\noutside. 'You're too much of a gentleman to do that, I know. And so, as\nI'm her natural friend--and indeed she's my cousin, not that far off--I\nthink it's right that we should all understand one another.'\n\n'Oh, quite right,' said Charley.\n\n'You can't expect that she should go and sacrifice herself for you, you\nknow,' said Mrs. Davis, who now that she had begun hardly knew how to\nstop herself. 'A girl's time is her money. She's at her best now, and\na girl like her must make her hay while the sun shines. She can't go\non fal-lalling with you, and then nothing to come of it. You mustn't\nsuppose she's to lose her market that way.'\n\n'God knows I should be sorry to injure her, Mrs. Davis.'\n\n'I believe you would, because I take you for an honourable gentleman as\nwill be as good as your word. Now, there's Peppermint there.'\n\n'What! that fellow in the parlour?'\n\n'And an honourable gentleman he is. Not that I mean to compare him to\nyou, Mr. Tudor, nor yet doesn't Norah; not by no means. But there he is.\nWell, he comes with the most honourablest proposals, and will make her\nMrs. Peppermint to-morrow, if so be that she'll have it.'\n\n'You don't mean to say that there has been anything between them?' said\nCharley, who in spite of the intense desire which he had felt a few\nminutes since to get the lovely Norah altogether off his hands, now felt\nan acute pang of jealousy.' You don't mean to say that there has been\nanything between them?'\n\n'Nothing as you have any right to object to, Mr. Tudor. You may be sure\nI wouldn't allow of that, nor yet wouldn't Norah demean herself to it.'\n\n'Then how did she get talking to him?'\n\n'She didn't get talking to him. But he has eyes in his head, and you\ndon't suppose but what he can see with them. If a girl is in the public\nline, of course any man is free to speak to her. If you don't like it,\nit is for you to take her out of it. Not but what, for a girl that is in\nthe public line, Norah Geraghty keeps herself to herself as much as any\ngirl you ever set eyes on.'\n\n'What the d---- has she to do with this fellow then?'\n\n'Why, he's a widower, and has three young children; and he's looking\nout for a mother for them; and he thinks Norah will suit. There, now you\nhave the truth, and the whole truth.'\n\n'D---- his impudence!' said Charley.\n\n'Well, I don't see that there's any impudence. He has a house of his\nown and the means to keep it. Now I'll tell you what it is. Norah can't\nabide him--'\n\nCharley looked a little better satisfied when he heard this declaration.\n\n'Norah can't abide the sight of him; nor won't of any man as long as you\nare hanging after her. She's as true as steel, and proud you ought to\nbe of her.' Proud, thought Charley, as he again muttered to himself,\n'Excelsior!'--'But, Mr. Tudor, I won't see her put upon; that's the long\nand the short of it. If you like to take her, there she is. I don't say\nshe's just your equal as to breeding, though she's come of decent people\ntoo; but she's good as gold. She'll make a shilling go as far as any\nyoung woman I know; and if \u00c2\u00a3100 or \u00c2\u00a3150 are wanting for furniture or the\nlike of that, why, I've that regard for her, that that shan't stand in\nthe way. Now, Mr. Tudor, I've spoke honest; and if you're the gentleman\nas I takes you to be, you'll do the same.'\n\nTo do Mrs. Davis justice, it must be acknowledged that in her way she\nhad spoken honestly. Of course she knew that such a marriage would be\na dreadful misalliance for young Tudor; of course she knew that all his\nfriends would be heart-broken when they heard of it. But what had she\nto do with his friends? Her sympathies, her good wishes, were for her\nfriend. Had Norah fallen a victim to Charley's admiration, and then been\ncast off to eat the bitterest bread to which any human being is ever\ndoomed, what then would Charley's friends have cared for her? There\nwas a fair fight between them. If Norah Geraghty, as a reward for her\nprudence, could get a husband in a rank of life above her, instead of\nfalling into utter destruction as might so easily have been the case,\nwho could do other than praise her--praise her and her clever friend who\nhad so assisted her in her struggle?\n\n  Dolus an virtus--\n\nHad Mrs. Davis ever studied the classics she would have thus expressed\nherself.\n\nPoor Charley was altogether thrown on his beam-ends. He had altogether\nplayed Mrs. Davis's game in evincing jealousy at Mr. Peppermint's\nattentions. He knew this, and yet for the life of him he could not help\nbeing jealous. He wanted to get rid of Miss Geraghty, and yet he could\nnot endure that anyone else should lay claim to her favour. He was very\nweak. He knew how much depended on the way in which he might answer this\nwoman at the present moment; he knew that he ought now to make it plain\nto her, that however foolish he might have been, however false he might\nhave been, it was quite out of the question that he should marry her\nbarmaid. But he did not do so. He was worse than weak. It was not only\nthe disinclination to give pain, or even the dread of the storm that\nwould ensue, which deterred him; but an absurd dislike to think that\nMr. Peppermint should be graciously received there as the barmaid's\nacknowledged admirer.\n\n'Is she really ill now?' said he.\n\n'She's not so ill but what she shall make herself well enough to welcome\nyou, if you'll say the word that you ought to say. The most that ails\nher is fretting at the long delay.--Bolt the door, child, and go to bed;\nthere will be no one else here now. Go up, and tell Miss Geraghty to\ncome down; she hasn't got her clothes off yet, I know.'\n\nMrs. Davis was too good a general to press Charley for an absolute,\nimmediate, fixed answer to her question. She knew that she had already\ngained much, by talking thus of the proposed marriage, by setting it\nthus plainly before Charley, without rebuke or denial from him. He\nhad not objected to receiving a visit from Norah, on the implied\nunderstanding that she was to come down to him as his affianced bride.\nHe had not agreed to this in words; but silence gives consent, and\nMrs. Davis felt that should it ever hereafter become necessary to prove\nanything, what had passed would enable her to prove a good deal.\n\nCharley puffed at his cigar and sipped his gin and water. It was now\ntwelve o'clock, and he thoroughly wished himself at home and in bed. The\nlonger he thought of it the more impossible it appeared that he should\nget out of the house without the scene which he dreaded. The girl had\nbolted the door, put away her cups and mugs, and her step upstairs had\nstruck heavily on his ears. The house was not large or high, and he\nfancied that he heard mutterings on the landing-place. Indeed he did not\ndoubt but that Miss Geraghty had listened to most of the conversation\nwhich had taken place.\n\n'Excuse me a minute, Mr. Tudor,' said Mrs. Davis, who was now smiling\nand civil enough; 'I will go upstairs myself; the silly girl is\nshamefaced, and does not like to come down'; and up went Mrs. Davis to\nsee that her barmaid's curls and dress were nice and jaunty. It would\nnot do now, at this moment, for Norah to offend her lover by any\nuntidiness. Charley for a moment thought of the front door. The enemy\nhad allowed him an opportunity for retreating. He might slip out before\neither of the women came down, and then never more be heard of in\nNorfolk Street again. He had his hand in his waistcoat pocket, with the\nintent of leaving the sovereign on the table; but when the moment came\nhe felt ashamed of the pusillanimity of such an escape, and therefore\nstood, or rather sat his ground, with a courage worthy of a better\npurpose.\n\nDown the two women came, and Charley felt his heart beating against\nhis ribs. As the steps came nearer the door, he began to wish that Mr.\nPeppermint had been successful. The widow entered the room first, and at\nher heels the expectant beauty. We can hardly say that she was blushing;\nbut she did look rather shamefaced, and hung back a little at the door,\nas though she still had half a mind to think better of it, and go off to\nher bed.\n\n'Come in, you little fool,' said Mrs. Davis. 'You needn't be ashamed of\ncoming down to see him; you have done that often enough before now.'\n\nNorah simpered and sidled. 'Well, I'm sure now!' said she. 'Here's a\nstart, Mr. Tudor; to be brought downstairs at this time of night; and\nI'm sure I don't know what it's about'; and then she shook her curls,\nand twitched her dress, and made as though she were going to pass\nthrough the room to her accustomed place at the bar.\n\nNorah Geraghty was a fine girl. Putting her in comparison with Miss\nGolightly, we are inclined to say that she was the finer girl of the\ntwo; and that, barring position, money, and fashion, she was qualified\nto make the better wife. In point of education, that is, the effects\nof education, there was not perhaps much to choose between them. Norah\ncould make an excellent pudding, and was willing enough to exercise her\nindustry and art in doing so; Miss Golightly could copy music, but she\ndid not like the trouble; and could play a waltz badly. Neither of them\nhad ever read anything beyond a few novels. In this respect, as to the\namount of labour done, Miss Golightly had certainly far surpassed her\nrival competitor for Charley's affections.\n\nCharley got up and took her hand; and as he did so, he saw that her\nnails were dirty. He put his arms round her waist and kissed her; and as\nhe caressed her, his olfactory nerves perceived that the pomatum in her\nhair was none of the best. He thought of those young lustrous eyes that\nwould look up so wondrously into his face; he thought of the gentle\ntouch, which would send a thrill through all his nerves; and then he\nfelt very sick.\n\n'Well, upon my word, Mr. Tudor,' said Miss Geraghty, 'you're making very\nfree to-night.' She did not, however, refuse to sit down on his knee,\nthough while sitting there she struggled and tossed herself, and shook\nher long ringlets in Charley's face, till he wished her--safe at home in\nMr. Peppermint's nursery.\n\n'And is that what you brought me down for, Mrs. Davis?' said Norah.\n'Well, upon my word, I hope the door's locked; we shall have all the\nworld in here else.'\n\n'If you hadn't come down to him, he'd have come up to you,' said Mrs.\nDavis.\n\n'Would he though?' said Norah; 'I think he knows a trick worth two of\nthat;' and she looked as though she knew well how to defend herself, if\nany over-zeal on the part of her lover should ever induce him to violate\nthe sanctum of her feminine retirement.\n\nThere was no over-zeal now about Charley. He ought to have been happy\nenough, for he had his charmer in his arms; but he showed very little\nof the ecstatic joy of a favoured lover. There he sat with Norah in his\narms, and as we have said, Norah was a handsome girl; but he would much\nsooner have been copying the Kennett and Avon canal lock entries in Mr.\nSnape's room at the Internal Navigation.\n\n'Lawks, Mr. Tudor, you needn't hold me so tight,' said Norah.\n\n'He means to hold you tight enough now,' said Mrs. Davis. 'He's very\nangry because I mentioned another gentleman's name.'\n\n'Well, now you didn't?' said Norah, pretending to look very angry.\n\n'Well, I just did; and if you'd only seen him! You must be very careful\nwhat you say to that gentleman, or there'll be a row in the house.'\n\n'I!' said Norah. 'What I say to him! It's very little I have to say to\nthe man. But I shall tell him this; he'd better take himself somewhere\nelse, if he's going to make himself troublesome.'\n\nAll this time Charley had said nothing, but was sitting with his hat on\nhis head, and his cigar in his mouth. The latter appendage he had laid\ndown for a moment when he saluted Miss Geraghty; but he had resumed it,\nhaving at the moment no intention of repeating the compliment.\n\n'And so you were jealous, were you?' said she, turning round and looking\nat him. 'Well now, some people might have more respect for other people\nthan to mix up their names that way, with the names of any men that\nchoose to put themselves forward. What would you say if I was to talk to\nyou about Miss----'\n\nCharley stopped her mouth. It was not to be borne that she should be\nallowed to pronounce the name that was about to fall from her lips.\n\n'So you were jealous, were you?' said she, when she was again able to\nspeak. 'Well, my!'\n\n'Mrs. Davis told me flatly that you were going to marry the man,' said\nCharley; 'so what was I to think?'\n\n'It doesn't matter what you think now,' said Mrs. Davis; 'for you must\nbe off from this. Do you know what o'clock it is? Do you want the house\nto get a bad name? Come, you two understand each other now, so you may\nas well give over billing and cooing for this time. It's all settled\nnow, isn't it, Mr. Tudor?'\n\n'Oh yes, I suppose so,' said Charley.\n\n'Well, and what do you say, Norah?'\n\n'Oh, I'm sure I'm agreeable if he is. Ha! ha! ha! I only hope he won't\nthink me too forward--he! he! he!'\n\nAnd then with another kiss, and very few more words of any sort, Charley\ntook himself off.\n\n'I'll have nothing more to do with him,' said Norah, bursting into\ntears, as soon as the door was well bolted after Charley's exit. 'I'm\nonly losing myself with him. He don't mean anything, and I said he\ndidn't all along. He'd have pitched me to Old Scratch, while I was\nsitting there on his knee, if he'd have had his own way--so he would;'\nand poor Norah cried heartily, as she went to her work in her usual way\namong the bottles and taps.\n\n'Why, you fool you, what do you expect? You don't think he's to jump\ndown your throat, do you? You can but try it on; and then if it don't\ndo, why there's the other one to fall back on; only, if I had the\nchoice, I'd rather have young Tudor, too.'\n\n'So would I,' said Norah; 'I can't abide that other fellow.'\n\n'Well, there, that's how it is, you know--beggars can't be choosers. But\ncome, make us a drop of something hot; a little drop will do yourself\ngood; but it's better not to take it before him, unless when he presses\nyou.'\n\nSo the two ladies sat down to console themselves, as best they might,\nfor the reverses which trade and love so often bring with them.\n\nCharley walked off a miserable man. He was thoroughly ashamed of\nhimself, thoroughly acknowledged his own weakness; and yet as he went\nout from the 'Cat and Whistle,' he felt sure that he should return there\nagain to renew the degradation from which he had suffered this night.\nIndeed, what else could he do now? He had, as it were, solemnly plighted\nhis troth to the girl before a third person who had brought them\ntogether, with the acknowledged purpose of witnessing that ceremony. He\nhad, before Mrs. Davis, and before the girl herself, heard her spoken\nof as his wife, and had agreed to the understanding that such an\narrangement was a settled thing. What else had he to do now but to\nreturn and complete his part of the bargain? What else but that, and\nbe a wretched, miserable, degraded man for the rest of his days; lower,\nviler, more contemptible, infinitely lower, even than his brother\nclerics at the office, whom in his pride he had so much despised?\n\nHe walked from Norfolk Street into the Strand, and there the world was\nstill alive, though it was now nearly one o'clock. The debauched misery,\nthe wretched outdoor midnight revelry of the world was there, streaming\nin and out from gin-palaces, and bawling itself hoarse with horrid,\ndiscordant, screech-owl slang. But he went his way unheeding and\nuncontaminated. Now, now that it was useless, he was thinking of the\nbetter things of the world; nothing now seemed worth his grasp, nothing\nnow seemed pleasurable, nothing capable of giving joy, but what was\ndecent, good, reputable, cleanly, and polished. How he hated now that\nlower world with which he had for the last three years condescended to\npass so much of his time! how he hated himself for his own vileness! He\nthought of what Alaric was, of what Norman was, of what he himself might\nhave been--he that was praised by Mrs. Woodward for his talent, he that\nwas encouraged to place himself among the authors of the day! He thought\nof all this, and then he thought of what he was--the affianced husband\nof Norah Geraghty!\n\nHe went along the Strand, over the crossing under the statue of Charles\non horseback, and up Pall Mall East till he came to the opening into\nthe park under the Duke of York's column. The London night world was\nall alive as he made his way. From the Opera Colonnade shrill voices\nshrieked out at him as he passed, and drunken men coming down from\nthe night supper-houses in the Haymarket saluted him with affectionate\ncordiality. The hoarse waterman from the cabstand, whose voice had\nperished in the night air, croaked out at him the offer of a vehicle;\nand one of the night beggar-women who cling like burrs to those who roam\nthe street a these unhallowed hours still stuck to him, as she had done\never since he had entered the Strand.\n\n'Get away with you,' said Charley, turning at the wretched creature in\nhis fierce anger; 'get away, or I'll give you in charge.'\n\n'That you may never know what it is to be in misery yourself!' said the\nmiserable Irishwoman.\n\n'If you follow me a step farther I'll have you locked up,' said Charley.\n\n'Oh, then, it's you that have the hard heart,' said she; 'and it's you\nthat will suffer yet.'\n\nCharley looked round, threw her the odd halfpence which he had in his\npocket, and then turned down towards the column. The woman picked up her\nprize, and, with a speedy blessing, took herself off in search of other\nprey.\n\nHis way home would have taken him up Waterloo Place, but the space round\nthe column was now deserted and quiet, and sauntering there, without\nthinking of what he did, he paced up and down between the Clubs and\nthe steps leading into the park. There, walking to and fro slowly, he\nthought of his past career, of all the circumstances of his life since\nhis life had been left to his own control, and of the absence of all\nhope for the future.\n\nWhat was he to do? He was deeply, inextricably in debt. That wretch,\nM'Ruen, had his name on bills which it was impossible that he should\never pay. Tradesmen held other bills of his which were either now\nover-due, or would very shortly become so. He was threatened with\nnumerous writs, any one of which would suffice to put him into gaol.\nFrom his poor father, burdened as he was with other children, he knew\nthat he had no right to expect further assistance. He was in debt to\nNorman, his best, he would have said his only friend, had it not been\nthat in all his misery he could not help still thinking of Mrs. Woodward\nas his friend.\n\nAnd yet how could his venture to think longer of her, contaminated as he\nnow was with the horrid degradation of his acknowledged love at the 'Cat\nand Whistle!' No; he must think no more of the Woodwards; he must dream\nno more of those angel eyes which in his waking moments had so often\npeered at him out of heaven, teaching him to think of higher things,\ngiving him higher hopes than those which had come to him from the\nworking of his own unaided spirit. Ah! lessons taught in vain! vain\nhopes! lessons that had come all too late! hopes that had been cherished\nonly to be deceived! It was all over now! He had made his bed, and he\nmust lie on it; he had sown his seed, and he must reap his produce;\nthere was now no 'Excelsior' left for him within the bounds of human\nprobability.\n\nHe had promised to go to Hampton with Harry Norman on Saturday, and\nhe would go there for the last time. He would go there and tell Mrs.\nWoodward so much of the truth as he could bring himself to utter; he\nwould say farewell to that blest abode; he would take Linda's soft hand\nin his for the last time; for the last time he would hear the young,\nsilver-ringing, happy voice of his darling Katie; for the last time look\ninto her bright face; for the last time play with her as with a child of\nheaven--and then he would return to the 'Cat and Whistle.'\n\nAnd having made this resolve he went home to his lodgings. It was\nsingular that in all his misery the idea hardly once occurred to him of\nsetting himself right in the world by accepting his cousin's offer of\nMiss Golightly's hand and fortune.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nHAMPTON COURT BRIDGE\n\n\nBefore the following Saturday afternoon Charley's spirits had somewhat\nrecovered their natural tone. Not that he was in a happy frame of mind;\nthe united energies of Mr. M'Ruen and Mrs. Davis had been too powerful\nto allow of that; not that he had given over his projected plan of\nsaying a long farewell to Mrs. Woodward, or at any rate of telling her\nsomething of his position; he still felt that he could not continue to\nlive on terms of close intimacy both with her daughters and with Norah\nGeraghty. But the spirits of youth are ever buoyant, and the spirits of\nno one could be endowed, with more natural buoyancy than those of the\nyoung navvy. Charley, therefore, in spite of his misfortunes, was ready\nwith his manuscript when Saturday afternoon arrived, and, according to\nagreement, met Norman at the railway station.\n\nOnly one evening had intervened since the night in which he had ratified\nhis matrimonial engagement, and in spite of the delicate nature of his\nposition he had for that evening allowed Mr. Peppermint to exercise his\neloquence on the heart of the fair Norah without interruption. He the\nwhile had been engaged in completing the memoirs of 'Crinoline and\nMacassar.'\n\n'Well, Charley,' they asked, one and all, as soon as he reached the\nCottage, 'have you got the story? Have you brought the manuscript? Is it\nall finished and ready for that dreadful editor?'\n\nCharley produced a roll, and Linda and Katie instantly pounced upon it.\n\n'Oh! it begins with poetry,' said Linda.\n\n'I am so glad,' said Katie. 'Is there much poetry in it, Charley? I do\nso hope there is.'\n\n'Not a word of it,' said Charley; 'that which Linda sees is a song\nthat the heroine is singing, and it isn't supposed to be written by the\nauthor at all.'\n\n'I'm so sorry that there's no poetry,' said Katie. 'Can't you write\npoetry, Charley?'\n\n'At any rate there's lots of love in it,' said Linda, who was turning\nover the pages.\n\n'Is there?' said Katie. 'Well, that's next best; but they should go\ntogether. You should have put all your love into verse, Charley, and\nthen your prose would have done for the funny parts.'\n\n'Perhaps it's all fun,' said Mrs. Woodward. 'But come, girls, this\nis not fair; I won't let you look at the story till it's read in full\ncommittee.' And so saying, Mrs. Woodward took the papers from her\ndaughters, and tying them up, deposited them safe in custody. 'We'll\nhave it out when the tea-things are gone.'\n\nBut before the tea-things had come, an accident happened, which had been\nlike to dismiss 'Crinoline and Macassar' altogether from the minds of\nthe whole of the Woodward family. The young men had, as usual, dined in\ntown, and therefore they were all able to spend the long summer evening\nout of doors. Norman's boat was down at Hampton, and it was therefore\ndetermined that they should row down as far as Hampton Court Park\nand back. Charley and Norman were to row; and Mrs. Woodward agreed to\naccompany her daughters. Uncle Bat was left at home, to his nap and rum\nand water.\n\nNorman was so expert a Thames waterman, that he was quite able to manage\nthe boat without a steersman, and Charley was nearly his equal. But\nthere is some amusement in steering, and Katie was allowed to sit\nbetween the tiller-ropes.\n\n'I can steer very well, mamma: can't I, Harry? I always steer when we go\nto the island, and we run the boat straight into the little creek, only\njust broad enough to hold it.' Katie's visits to the island, however,\nwere not so frequent as they had heretofore been, for she was\napproaching to sixteen years of age, and wet feet and draggled\npetticoats had lost some of their charms. Mrs. Woodward, trusting more\nto the experience of her two knights than to the skill of the lady at\nthe helm, took her seat, and they went off merrily down the stream.\n\nAll the world knows that it is but a very little distance from Hampton\nChurch to Hampton Court Bridge, especially when one has the stream with\none. They were very soon near to the bridge, and as they approached it,\nthey had to pass a huge barge, that was lazily making its way down to\nBrentford.\n\n'There's lots of time for the big arch,' said Charley.\n\n'Pull away then,' said Harry.\n\nThey both pulled hard, and shot alongside and past the barge. But the\nstream was strong, and the great ugly mass of black timber moved behind\nthem quicker than it seemed to do.\n\n'It will be safer to take the one to the left,' said Harry.\n\n'Oh! there's lots of time,' said Charley.\n\n'No,' said Harry, 'do as I tell you and go to the left.--Pull your left\nhand a little, Katie.'\n\nCharley did as he was bid, and Katie intended to do the same; but\nunfortunately she pulled the wrong hand. They were now very near the\nbridge, and the barge was so close to them as to show that there might\nhave been danger in attempting to get through the same arch with her.\n\n'Your left hand, Katie, your left,' shouted Norman; 'your left string.'\nKatie was confused, and gave first a pull with her right, and then a\npull with her left, and then a strong pull with her right. The two men\nbacked water as hard as they could, but the effect of Katie's steering\nwas to drive the nose of the boat right into one of the wooden piers of\nthe bridge.\n\nThe barge went on its way, and luckily made its entry under the arch\nbefore the little craft had swung round into the stream before it; as\nit was, the boat, still clinging by its nose, came round with its stern\nagainst the side of the barge, and as the latter went on, the timbers of\nNorman's wherry cracked and crumpled in the rude encounter.\n\nThe ladies should all have kept their seats. Mrs. Woodward did do so.\nLinda jumped up, and being next to the barge, was pulled up into it by\none of the men. Katie stood bolt upright, with the tiller-ropes still in\nher hand, awe-struck at the misfortune she had caused; but while she was\nso standing, the stern of the boat was lifted nearly out of the water\nby the weight of the barge, and Katie was pitched, behind her mother's\nback, head foremost into the water.\n\nNorman, at the moment, was endeavouring to steady the boat, and shove\nit off from the barge, and had also lent a hand to assist Linda in her\nescape. Charley was on the other side, standing up and holding on by\nthe piers of the bridge, keeping his eyes on the ladies, so as to be of\nassistance to them when assistance might be needed.\n\nAnd now assistance was sorely needed, and luckily had not to be long\nwaited for. Charley, with a light and quick step, passed over the\nthwarts, and, disregarding Mrs. Woodward's scream, let himself down,\nover the gun-wale behind her seat into the water. Katie can hardly be\nsaid to have sunk at all. She had, at least, never been so much under\nthe water as to be out of sight. Her clothes kept up her light body; and\nwhen Charley got close to her, she had been carried up to the piers of\nthe bridge, and was panting with her head above water, and beating the\nstream with her little hands.\n\nShe was soon again in comparative safety. Charley had her by one arm as\nhe held on with the other to the boat, and kept himself afloat with his\nlegs. Mrs. Woodward leaned over and caught her daughter's clothes; while\nLinda, who had seen what had happened, stood shrieking on the barge, as\nit made its way on, heedless of the ruin it left behind.\n\nAnother boat soon came to their assistance from the shore, and Mrs.\nWoodward and Katie were got safely into it. Charley returned to\nthe battered wherry, and assisted Norman in extricating it from its\nposition; and a third boat went to Linda's rescue, who would otherwise\nhave found herself in rather an uncomfortable position the next morning\nat Brentford.\n\nThe hugging and kissing to which Katie was subjected when she was\ncarried up to the inn, near the boat-slip on the Surrey side of\nthe river, may be imagined; as may also the faces she made at the\nwineglassful of stiff brandy and water which she was desired to drink.\nShe was carried home in a fly, and by the time she arrived there, had so\ncompletely recovered her life and spirits as to put a vehement negative\non her mother's proposition that she should at once go to bed.\n\n'And not hear dear Charley's story?' said she, with tears in her eyes.\n'And, mamma, I can't and won't go to bed without seeing Charley. I\ndidn't say one word yet to thank him for jumping into the water after\nme.'\n\nIt was in vain that her mother told her that Charley's story would amuse\nher twice as much when she should read it printed; it was in vain that\nMrs. Woodward assured her that Charley should come up to her room door;\nand hear her thanks as he stood in the passage, with the door ajar.\nKatie was determined to hear the story read. It must be read, if read\nat all, that Saturday night, as it was to be sent to the editor in the\ncourse of the week; and reading 'Crinoline and Macassar' out loud on\na Sunday was not to be thought of at Surbiton Cottage. Katie was\ndetermined to hear the story read, and to sit very near the author too\nduring the reading; to sit near him, and to give him such praise as even\nin her young mind she felt that an author would like to hear. Charley\nhad pulled her out of the river, and no one, as far as her efforts could\nprevent it, should be allowed to throw cold water on him.\n\nNorman and Charley, wet as the latter was, contrived to bring the\nshattered boat back to Hampton. When they reached the lawn at Surbiton\nCottage they were both in high spirits. An accident, if it does no\nmaterial harm, is always an inspiriting thing, unless one feels that it\nhas been attributable to one's own fault. Neither of them could in this\ninstance attach any blame to himself, and each felt that he had done\nwhat in him lay to prevent the possible ill effect of the mischance. As\nfor the boat, Harry was too happy to think that none of his friends were\nhurt to care much about that.\n\nAs they walked across the lawn Mrs. Woodward ran out to them. 'My dear,\ndear Charley,' she said, 'what am I to say to thank you?' It was the\nfirst time Mrs. Woodward had ever called him by his Christian name. It\nhad hitherto made him in a certain degree unhappy that she never did so,\nand now the sound was very pleasant to him.\n\n'Oh, Mrs. Woodward,' said he, laughing, 'you mustn't touch me, for I'm\nall mud.'\n\n'My dear, dear Charley, what can I say to you? and dear Harry, I fear\nwe've spoilt your beautiful new boat.'\n\n'I fear we've spoilt Katie's beautiful new hat,' said Norman.\n\nMrs. Woodward had taken and pressed a hand of each of them, in spite of\nCharley's protestations about the mud.\n\n'Oh! you're in a dreadful state,' said she; 'you had better take\nsomething at once; you'll catch your death of cold.'\n\n'I'd better take myself off to the inn,' said Charley, 'and get some\nclean clothes; that's all I want. But how is Katie--and how is Linda?'\n\nAnd so, after a multitude of such inquiries on both sides, and of all\nmanner of affectionate greetings, Charley went off to make himself dry,\npreparatory to the reading of the manuscript.\n\nDuring his absence, Linda and Katie came down to the drawing-room. Linda\nwas full of fun as to her journey with the bargeman; but Katie was a\nlittle paler than usual, and somewhat more serious and quiet than she\nwas wont to be.\n\nNorman was the first in the drawing-room, and received the thanks of the\nladies for his prowess in assisting them; and Charley was not slow to\nfollow him, for he was never very long at his toilet. He came in with a\njaunty laughing air, as though nothing particular had happened, and as\nif he had not a care in the world. And yet while he had been dressing he\nhad been thinking almost more than ever of Norah Geraghty. O that she,\nand Mrs. Davis with her, and Jabesh M'Ruen with both of them, could be\nburied ten fathom deep out of his sight, and out of his mind!\n\nWhen he entered the room, Katie felt her heart beat so strongly that she\nhardly knew how to thank him for saving her life. A year ago she\nwould have got up and kissed him innocently; but a year makes a great\ndifference. She could not do that now, so she gave him her little hand,\nand held his till he came and sat down at his place at the table.\n\n'Oh, Charley, I don't know what to say to you,' said she; and he could\nsee and feel that her whole body was shaking with emotion.\n\n'Then I'll tell you what to say: 'Charley, here is your tea, and some\nbread, and some butter, and some jam, and some muffin,' for I'll tell\nyou what, my evening bath has made me as hungry as a hunter. I hope it\nhas done the same to you.'\n\nKatie, still holding his hand, looked up into his face, and he saw that\nher eyes were suffused with tears. She then left his side, and, running\nround the room, filled a plate with all the things he had asked for,\nand, bringing them to him, again took her place beside him. 'I wish I\nknew how to do more than that,' said she.\n\n'I suppose, Charley, you'll have to make an entry about that barge\non Monday morning, won't you?' said Linda. 'Mind you put in it how\nbeautiful I looked sailing through the arch.'\n\n 'Yes, and how very gallant the bargeman was,' said Norman.\n\n'Yes, and how much you enjoyed the idea of going down the river with\nhim, while, we came back to the Cottage,' said Charley. 'We'll put it\nall down at the Navigation, and old Snape shall make a special minute\nabout it.'\n\nKatie drank her tea in silence, and tried to eat, though without much\nsuccess. When chatting voices and jokes were to be heard at the Cottage,\nthe sound of her voice was usually the foremost; but now she sat demure\nand quiet. She was realizing the danger from which she had escaped, and,\nas is so often the case, was beginning to fear it now that it was over.\n\n'Ah, Katie, my bonny bird,' said her mother, seeing that she was not\nherself, and knowing that the excitement and overpowering feelings of\ngratitude were too much for her--come here; you should be in bed, my\nfoolish little puss, should you not?'\n\n'Indeed, she should,' said Uncle Bat, who was somewhat hard-hearted\nabout the affair of the accident, and had been cruel enough, after\nhearing an account of it, to declare that it was all Katie's fault.\n\n'Indeed, she should; and if she had gone to bed a little earlier in the\nevening it would have been all the better for Master Norman's boat.'\n\n'Oh! mamma, don't send me to bed,' said she, with tears in her eyes.\n'Pray don't send me to bed now; I'm quite well, only I can't talk\nbecause I'm thinking of what Charley did for me;' and so saying she got\nup, and, hiding her face on her mother's shoulder, burst into tears.\n\n'My dearest child,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'I'm afraid you'll make yourself\nill. We'll put off the reading, won't we, Charley? We have done enough\nfor one evening.'\n\n'Of course we will,' said he. 'Reading a stupid story will be very slow\nwork after all we've gone through to-day.'\n\n'No, no, no,' said Katie; 'it shan't be put off; there won't be any\nother time for hearing it. And, mamma it must be read; and I know it\nwon't be stupid. Oh; mamma, dear mamma, do let us hear it read; I'm\nquite well now.'\n\nMrs. Woodward found herself obliged to give way. She had not the heart\nto bid her daughter go away to bed, nor, had she done so, would it have\nbeen of any avail. Katie would only have lain and sobbed in her own\nroom, and very probably have gone into hysterics. The best thing for her\nwas to try to turn the current of her thoughts, and thus by degrees tame\ndown her excited feelings.\n\n'Well, darling, then we will have the story, if Charley will let us. Go\nand fetch it, dearest.' Katie raised herself from her mother's bosom,\nand, going across the room, fetched the roll of papers to Charley. As\nhe prepared to take it she took his hand in hers, and, bending her\nhead over it, tenderly kissed it. 'You mustn't think,' said she, 'that\nbecause I say nothing, I don't know what it is that you've done for me;\nbut I don't know how to say it.'\n\nCharley was at any rate as ignorant what he ought to say as Katie was.\nHe felt the pressure of her warm lips on his hand, and hardly knew\nwhere he was. He felt that he blushed and looked abashed, and dreaded,\nfearfully dreaded, lest Mrs. Woodward should surmise that he estimated\nat other than its intended worth, her daughter's show of affection for\nhim.\n\n'I shouldn't mind doing it every night,' said he, 'in such weather as\nthis. I think it rather good fun going into the water with my clothes\non.' Katie looked up at him through her tears, as though she would say\nthat she well understood what that meant.\n\nMrs. Woodward saw that if the story was to be read, the sooner they\nbegan it the better.\n\n'Come, Charley,' said she, 'now for the romance. Katie, come and sit\nby me.' But Katie had already taken her seat, a little behind Charley,\nquite in the shade, and she was not to be moved.\n\n'But I won't read it myself,' said Charley; 'you must read it, Mrs.\nWoodward.'\n\n'O yes, Mrs. Woodward, you are to read it,' said Norman.\n\n'O yes, do read it, manna,' said Linda.\n\nKatie said nothing, but she would have preferred that Charley should\nhave read it himself.\n\n'Well, if I can,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Snape says I write the worst hand in all Somerset House,' said Charley;\n'but still I think you'll be able to manage it.'\n\n'I hate that Mr. Snape,' said Katie, _sotto voce_. And then Mrs.\nWoodward unrolled the manuscript and began her task.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nCRINOLINE AND MACASSAR; OR, MY AUNT'S WILL\n\n\n'Well, Linda was right,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'it does begin with\npoetry.'\n\n'It's only a song,' said Charley, apologetically--'and after all there\nis only one verse of that'--and then Mrs. Woodward began\n\n\"CRINOLINE AND MACASSAR.\"\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen, that is the name of Mr. Charles Tudor's new\nnovel.'\n\n'Crinoline and Macassar!' said Uncle Bat. 'Are they intended for human\nbeings' names?'\n\n'They are the heroine and the hero, as I take it,' said Mrs. Woodward,\n'and I presume them to be human, unless they turn out to be celestial.'\n\n'I never heard such names in my life,' said the captain.\n\n'At any rate, uncle, they are as good as Sir Jib Boom and Captain\nHardaport,' said Katie, pertly.\n\n'We won't mind about that,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'I'm going to begin, and\nI beg I may not be interrupted.'\n\n\"CRINOLINE AND MACASSAR.\"\n\n\"The lovely Crinoline was sitting alone at a lattice window on a summer\nmorning, and as she sat she sang with melancholy cadence the first part\nof the now celebrated song which had then lately appeared, from the\ndistinguished pen of Sir G-- H--,\"\n\n'Who is Sir G-- H--, Charley?'\n\n'Oh, it wouldn't do for me to tell that,' said Charley. 'That must be\nleft to the tact and intelligence of my readers.'\n\n'Oh, very well,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'we will abstain from all\nimpertinent questions'--'from the distinguished pen of Sir G-- H--. The\nditty which she sang ran as follows:--\n\n  My heart's at my office, my heart is always there--\n  My heart's at my office, docketing with care;\n  Docketing the papers, and copying all day,\n  My heart's at my office, though I be far away.\n\n\"'Ah me!' said the Lady Crinoline--\"\n\n'What--is she a peer's daughter?' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'Not exactly,' said Charley, 'it's only a sort of semi-poetic way one\nhas of speaking of one's heroine.'\n\n\"'Ah me!' said the Lady Crinoline--'his heart! his heart!--I wonder\nwhether he has got a heart;' and then she sang again in low plaintive\nvoice the first line of the song, suiting the cadence to her own case:--\n\n  His heart is at his office, his heart is _always_ there.\n\n\"'It was evident that the Lady Crinoline did not repeat the words in the\nfeeling of their great author, who when he wrote them had intended to\nexcite to high deeds of exalted merit that portion of the British youth\nwhich is employed in the Civil Service of the country.\n\n\"Crinoline laid down her lute--it was in fact an accordion--and gazing\nlistlessly over the rails of the balcony, looked out at the green\nfoliage which adorned the enclosure of the square below.\n\n\"It was Tavistock Square. The winds of March and the showers of April\nhad been successful in producing the buds of May.\"\n\n'Ah, Charley, that's taken from the old song,' said Katie, 'only you've\nput buds instead of flowers.'\n\n'That's quite allowable,' said Mrs. Woodward--\"successful in producing\nthe buds of May. The sparrows chirped sweetly on the house-top, and the\ncoming summer gladdened the hearts of all--of all except poor Crinoline.\n\n\"'I wonder whether he has a heart, said she; 'and if he has, I wonder\nwhether it is at his office.'\n\n\"As she thus soliloquized, the door was opened by a youthful page, on\nwhose well-formed breast, buttons seemed to grow like mushrooms in the\nmeadows in August.\n\n\"'Mr. Macassar Jones,' said the page; and having so said, he discreetly\ndisappeared. He was in his line of life a valuable member of society.\nHe had brought from his last place a twelvemonth's character that\nwas creditable alike to his head and heart; he was now found to be a\ntrustworthy assistant in the household of the Lady Crinoline's mother,\nand was the delight of his aged parents, to whom he regularly remitted\nno inconsiderable portion of his wages. Let it always be remembered\nthat the life even of a page may be glorious. All honour to the true and\nbrave!\"\n\n'Goodness, Charley--how very moral you are!' said Linda.\n\n'Yes,' said he; 'that's indispensable. It's the intention of the _Daily\nDelight_ always to hold up a career of virtue to the lower orders as\nthe thing that pays. Honesty, high wages, and hot dinners. Those are our\nprinciples.'\n\n'You'll have a deal to do before you'll bring the lower orders to agree\nwith you,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'We have a deal to do,' said Charley, 'and we'll do it. The power of the\ncheap press is unbounded.'\n\n\"As the page closed the door, a light, low, melancholy step was heard\nto make its way across the drawing-room. Crinoline's heart had given one\nstart when she had heard the announcement of the well-known name. She\nhad once glanced with eager inquiring eye towards the door. But not in\nvain to her had an excellent mother taught the proprieties of elegant\nlife. Long before Macassar Jones was present in the chamber she had\nsnatched up the tambour-frame that lay beside her, and when he entered\nshe was zealously engaged on the fox's head that was to ornament the toe\nof a left-foot slipper. Who shall dare to say that those slippers were\nintended to grace the feet of Macassar Jones?\"\n\n'But I suppose they were,' said Katie.\n\n'You must wait and see,' said her mother; 'for my part I am not at all\nso sure of that.'\n\n'Oh, but I know they must be; for she's in love with him,' said Katie.\n\n\"'Oh, Mr. Macassar,' said the Lady Crinoline, when he had drawn nigh\nto her, 'and how are you to-day?' This mention of his Christian name\nbetrayed no undue familiarity, as the two families were intimate, and\nMacassar had four elder brothers. 'I am so sorry mamma is not at home;\nshe will regret not seeing you amazingly.'\n\n\"Macassar had his hat in his hand, and he stood a while gazing at the\nfox in the pattern. 'Won't you sit down?' said Crinoline.\n\n\"'Is it very dusty in the street to-day?' asked Crinoline; and as\nshe spoke she turned upon him a face wreathed in the sweetest smiles,\nradiant with elegant courtesy, and altogether expressive of extreme\ngentility, unsullied propriety, and a very high tone of female\neducation. 'Is it very dusty in the street to-day?'\n\n\"Charmed by the involuntary grace of her action, Macassar essayed to\nturn his head towards her as he replied; he could not turn it much, for\nhe wore an all-rounder; but still he was enabled by a side glance to see\nmore of that finished elegance than was perhaps good for his peace of\nmind.\n\n\"'Yes,' said he, 'it is dusty;--it certainly is dusty, rather;--but not\nvery--and then in most streets they've got the water-carts.'\n\n\"'Ah, I love those water-carts!' said Crinoline; 'the dust, you know, is\nso trying.'\n\n\"'To the complexion?' suggested Macassar, again looking round as best he\nmight over the bulwark of his collar.\n\n\"Crinoline laughed slightly; it was perhaps hardly more than a simper,\nand turning her lovely eyes from her work, she said, 'Well, to the\ncomplexion, if you will. What would you gentlemen say if we ladies were\nto be careless of our complexions?'\n\n\"Macassar merely sighed gently--perhaps he had no fitting answer;\nperhaps his heart was too full for him to answer. He sat with his eye\nfixed on his hat, which still dangled in his hand; but his mind's eye\nwas far away.\n\n\"'Is it in his office?' thought Crinoline to herself; 'or is it here? Is\nit anywhere?'\n\n\"'Have you learnt the song I sent you? said he at last, waking, as it\nwere, from a trance.\n\n\"'Not yet,' said she--'that is, not quite; that is, I could not sing it\nbefore strangers yet.'\n\n\"'Strangers!' said Macassar; and he looked at her again with an energy\nthat produced results not beneficial either to his neck or his collar.\n\n\"Crinoline was delighted at this expression of feeling. 'At any rate\nit is somewhere,' said she to herself; 'and it can hardly be all at his\noffice.'\n\n\"'Well, I will not say strangers,' she said out loud; 'it sounds--it\nsounds--I don't know how it sounds. But what I mean is, that as yet I've\nonly sung it before mamma!'\"\n\n'I declare I don't know which is the biggest fool of the two,' said\nUncle Bat, very rudely.' As for him, if I had him on the forecastle of a\nman-of-war for a day or two, I'd soon teach him to speak out.'\n\n'You forget, sir,' said Charley,' he's not a sailor, he's only in the\nCivil Service; we're all very bashful in the Civil Service.'\n\n'I think he is rather spooney, I must say,' said Katie; whereupon Mrs.\nWoodward went on reading.\n\n\"'It's a sweet thing, isn't it?' said Macassar.\n\n\"'Oh, very!' said Crinoline, with a rapturous expression which pervaded\nher whole head and shoulders as well as her face and bust--'very sweet,\nand so new.'\n\n\"'It quite comes home to me,' said Macassar, and he sighed deeply.\n\n\"'Then it is at his office,' said Crinoline to herself; and she sighed\nalso.\n\n\"They both sat silent for a while, looking into the square--Crinoline\nwas at one window, and Macassar at the other: 'I must go now,' said he:\n'I promised to be back at three.'\n\n\"'Back where?' said she.\n\n\"'At my office,' said he.\n\n\"Crinoline sighed. After all, it was at his office; it was too evident\nthat it was there, and nowhere else. Well, and why should it not be\nthere? why should not Macassar Jones be true to his duty and to his\ncountry? What had she to do with his heart? Why should she wish it\nelsewhere? 'Twas thus she tried to console herself, but in vain. Had\nshe had an office of her own it might perhaps have been different; but\nCrinoline was only a woman; and often she sighed over the degradation of\nher lot.\n\n\"'Good morning, Miss Crinoline,' said he.\n\n\"'Good morning, Mr. Macassar,' said she; 'mamma will so regret that she\nhas lost the pleasure of seeing you.'\n\n\"And then she rung the bell. Macassar went downstairs perhaps somewhat\nslower, with perhaps more of melancholy than when he entered. The page\nopened the hall-door with alacrity, and shut it behind him with a slam.\n\n\"All honour to the true and brave!\n\n\"Crinoline again took up the note of her sorrow, and with her lute in\nher hand, she warbled forth the line which stuck like a thorn in her\nsweet bosom:--\n\nHis heart is in his office--his heart IS ALWAYS _there_.\"\n\n'There,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'that's the end of the first chapter.'\n\n'Well, I like the page the best,' said Linda, 'because he seems to know\nwhat he is about.'\n\n'Oh, so does the lady,' said Charley; 'but it wouldn't at all do if\nwe made the hero and heroine go about their work like humdrum people.\nYou'll see that the Lady Crinoline knows very well what's what.'\n\n'Oh, Charley, pray don't tell us,' said Katie; 'I do so like Mr.\nMacassar, he is so spooney; pray go on, mamma.'\n\n'I'm ready,' said Mrs. Woodward, again taking up the manuscript.\n\n\"CHAPTER II\n\n\"The lovely Crinoline was the only daughter of fond parents; and though\nthey were not what might be called extremely wealthy, considering the\nvast incomes of some residents in the metropolis, and were not perhaps\nwont to mix in the highest circles of the Belgravian aristocracy, yet\nshe was enabled to dress in all the elegance of fashion, and contrived\nto see a good deal of that society which moves in the highly respectable\nneighbourhood of Russell Square and Gower Street.\n\n\"Her dresses were made at the distinguished establishment of Madame\nMantalini, in Hanover Square; at least she was in the habit of getting\none dress there every other season, and this was quite sufficient among\nher friends to give her a reputation for dealing in the proper quarter.\nOnce she had got a bonnet direct from Paris, which gave her ample\nopportunity of expressing a frequent opinion not favourable to the\nfabricators of a British article. She always took care that her shoes\nhad within them the name of a French cordonnier; and her gloves were\nmade to order in the Rue Du Bac, though usually bought and paid for in\nTottenham Court Road.\"\n\n'What a false creature!' said Linda.\n\n'False!' said Charley; 'and how is a girl to get along if she be not\nfalse? What girl could live for a moment before the world if she were to\ntell the whole truth about the get-up of her wardrobe--the patchings and\nmake-believes, the chipped ribbons and turned silks, the little bills\nhere, and the little bills there? How else is an allowance of \u00c2\u00a320 a year\nto be made compatible with an appearance of unlimited income? How else\nare young men to be taught to think that in an affair of dress money is\na matter of no moment whatsoever?'\n\n'Oh, Charley, Charley, don't be slanderous,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'I only repeat what the editor says to me--I know nothing about it\nmyself. Only we are requested 'to hold the mirror up to nature,'--and to\nart too, I believe. We are to set these things right, you know.'\n\n'We--who are we?' said Katie.\n\n'Why, the _Daily Delight_,' said Charley.\n\n'But I hope there's nothing false in patching and turning,' said Mrs.\nWoodward; 'for if there be, I'm the falsest woman alive.\n\n  To gar the auld claes look amaist as weel's the new\n\nis, I thought, one of the most legitimate objects of a woman's\ndiligence.'\n\n'It all depends on the spirit of the stitches,' said Charley the censor.\n\n'Well, I must say I don't like mending up old clothes a bit better than\nCharley does,' said Katie; 'but pray go on, mamma;' so Mrs. Woodward\ncontinued to read.\n\n\"On the day of Macassar's visit in Tavistock Square, Crinoline was\ndressed in a most elegant morning costume. It was a very light barege\nmuslin, extremely full; and which, as she had assured her friend, Miss\nManasseh, of Keppel Street, had been sent home from the establishment\nin Hanover Square only the day before. I am aware that Miss Manasseh\ninstantly propagated an ill-natured report that she had seen the\nidentical dress in a milliner's room up two pairs back in Store Street;\nbut then Miss Manasseh was known to be envious; and had moreover seen\ntwelve seasons out in those localities, whereas the fair Crinoline,\nyoung thing, had graced Tavistock Square only for two years; and her\nmother was ready to swear that she had never passed the nursery door\ntill she came there. The ground of the dress was a light pea-green,\nand the pattern was ivy wreaths entwined with pansies and tulips--each\nflounce showed a separate wreath--and there were nine flounces, the\nhighest of which fairy circles was about three inches below the smallest\nwaist that ever was tightly girded in steel and whalebone.\n\n\"Macassar had once declared, in a moment of ecstatic energy, that a\nsmall waist was the chiefest grace in woman. How often had the Lady\nCrinoline's maid, when in the extreme agony of her labour, put a\nmalediction on his name on account of this speech!\n\n\"It is unnecessary to speak of the drapery of the arms, which showed\nthe elaborate lace of the sleeve beneath, and sometimes also the pearly\nwhiteness of that rounded arm. This was a sight which would almost\ndrive Macassar to distraction. At such moments as that the hopes of\nthe patriotic poet for the good of the Civil Service were not strictly\nfulfilled in the heart of Macassar Jones. Oh, if the Lady Crinoline\ncould but have known!\n\n\"It is unnecessary also to describe the strange and hidden mechanism of\nthat mysterious petticoat which gave such full dimensions, such ample\nsweeping proportions to the _tout ensemble_ of the lady's appearance.\nIt is unnecessary, and would perhaps be improper, and as far as I am\nconcerned, is certainly impossible.\"\n\nHere Charley blushed, as Mrs. Woodward looked at him from over the top\nof the paper.\n\n\"Let it suffice to say that she could envelop a sofa without the\nslightest effort, throw her draperies a yard and a half from her on\neither side without any appearance of stretching, completely fill a\ncarriage; or, which was more frequently her fate, entangle herself all\nbut inextricably in a cab.\n\n\"A word, however, must be said of those little feet that peeped out now\nand again so beautifully from beneath the artistic constructions above\nalluded to-of the feet, or perhaps rather of the shoes. But yet, what\ncan be said of them successfully? That French name so correctly spelt,\nso elaborately accented, so beautifully finished in gold letters, which\nfrom their form, however, one would say that the _cordonnier_ must have\nimported from England, was only visible to those favoured knights who\nwere occasionally permitted to carry the shoes home in their pockets.\n\n\"But a word must be said about the hair dressed _\u00c3\u00a0 l'imperatrice_,\nredolent of the sweetest patchouli, disclosing all the glories of that\ningenuous, but perhaps too open brow. A word must be said; but,\nalas! how inefficacious to do justice to the ingenuity so wonderfully\ndisplayed! The hair of the Lady Crinoline was perhaps more lovely than\nabundant: to produce that glorious effect, that effect which has now\nsymbolized among English lasses the head-dress _\u00c3\u00a0 l'imperatrice_ as\nthe one idea of feminine beauty, every hair was called on to give its\nseparate aid. As is the case with so many of us who are anxious to put\nour best foot foremost, everything was abstracted from the rear in order\nto create a show in the front. Then to complete the garniture of\nthe head, to make all perfect, to leave no point of escape for the\nsusceptible admirer of modern beauty, some dorsal appendage was\nnecessary of mornings as well as in the more fully bedizened period of\nevening society.\n\n\"Everything about the sweet Crinoline was wont to be green. It is the\nsweetest and most innocent of colours; but, alas! a colour dangerous for\nthe heart's ease of youthful beauty. Hanging from the back of her head\nwere to be seen moss and fennel, and various grasses--rye grass and\ntimothy, trefoil and cinquefoil, vetches, and clover, and here and there\nyoung fern. A story was told, but doubtless false, as it was traced to\nthe mouth of Miss Manasseh, that once while Crinoline was reclining in\na paddock at Richmond, having escaped with the young Macassar from the\nheat of a neighbouring drawing-room, a cow had attempted to feed from\nher head.\"\n\n'Oh, Charley, a cow!' said Katie.\n\n'Well, but you see I don't give it as true,' said Charley.\n\n'I shall never get it done if Katie won't hold her tongue,' said Mrs.\nWoodward.\n\n\"But perhaps it was when at the seaside in September, at Broadstairs,\nHerne Bay, or Dover, Crinoline and her mamma invigorated themselves with\nthe sea-breezes of the ocean--perhaps it was there that she was enabled\nto assume that covering for her head in which her soul most delighted.\nIt was a Tom and Jerry hat turned up at the sides, with a short but\nknowing feather, velvet trimmings, and a steel buckle blinking brightly\nin the noonday sun. Had Macassar seen her in this he would have yielded\nhimself her captive at once, quarter or no quarter. It was the most\nmarked, and perhaps the most attractive peculiarity of the Lady\nCrinoline's face, that the end of her nose was a little turned up. This\ncharm, in unison with the upturned edges of her cruel-hearted hat, was\nfound by many men to be invincible.\n\n\"We all know how dreadful is the spectacle of a Saracen's head, as it\nappears, or did appear, painted on a huge board at the top of Snow\nHill. From that we are left to surmise with what tremendous audacity of\ncountenance, with what terror-striking preparations of the outward\nman, an Eastern army is led to battle. Can any men so fearfully bold in\nappearance ever turn their backs and fly? They look as though they could\ndestroy by the glance of their ferocious eyes. Who could withstand the\nhirsute horrors of those fiery faces?\n\n\"There is just such audacity, a courage of a similar description,\nperhaps we may say an equal invincibility, in the charms of those\nTom and Jerry hats when duly put on, over a face of the proper\ndescription--over such a face as that of the Lady Crinoline. They\ngive to the wearer an appearance of concentration of pluck. But as the\nEastern array does quail before the quiet valour of Europe, so, we may\nperhaps say, does the open, quick audacity of the Tom and Jerry tend to\nless powerful results than the modest enduring patience of the bonnet.\"\n\n'So ends the second chapter--bravo, Charley,' said Mrs. Woodward. 'In\nthe name of the British female public, I beg to thank you for your\nexertions.'\n\n'The editor said I was to write down turned-up hats,' said Charley. 'I\nrather like them myself.'\n\n'I hope my new slouch is not an audacious Saracen's head,' said Linda.\n\n'Or mine,' said Katie. 'But you may say what you like about them now;\nfor mine is drowned.'\n\n'Come, girls, there are four more chapters, I see. Let me finish it, and\nthen we can discuss it afterwards.'\n\n\"CHAPTER III\n\n\"Having thus described the Lady Crinoline----\"\n\n'You haven't described her at all,' said Linda; 'you haven't got beyond\nher clothes yet.'\n\n'There is nothing beyond them,' said Charley.\n\n'You haven't even described her face,' said Katie; 'you have only said\nthat she had a turned-up nose.'\n\n'There is nothing further that one can say about it,' said Charley.\n\n\"Having thus described the Lady Crinoline,' continued Mrs. Woodward, 'it\nnow becomes our duty, as impartial historians, to give some account of\nMr. Macassar Jones.\n\n\"We are not prepared to give the exact name of the artist by whom Mr.\nMacassar Jones was turned out to the world so perfectly dressed a man.\nWere we to do so, the signal service done to one establishment by such\nan advertisement would draw down on us the anger of the trade at\nlarge, and the tailors of London would be in league against the _Daily\nDelight_. It is sufficient to remark that the artist's offices are not\na hundred miles from Pall Mall. Nor need we expressly name the bootmaker\nto whom is confided the task of making those feet 'small by degrees and\nbeautifully less.' The process, we understand, has been painful, but the\neffect is no doubt remunerative.\n\n\"In three especial walks of dress has Macassar Jones been more than\nordinarily careful to create a sensation; and we believe we may assert\nthat he has been successful in all. We have already alluded to his feet.\nAscending from them, and ascending not far, we come to his coat. It is\nneedless to say that it is a frock; needless to say that it is a long\nfrock--long as those usually worn by younger infants, and apparently\nmade so for the same purpose. But look at the exquisitely small\nproportions of the collar; look at the grace of the long sleeves, the\nlength of back, the propriety, the innate respectability, the perfect\ndecorum--we had almost said the high moral worth--of the whole. Who\nwould not willingly sacrifice any individual existence that he might\nbecome the exponent of such a coat? Macassar Jones was proud to do so.\n\n\"But he had bestowed perhaps the greatest amount of personal attention\non his collar. It was a matter more within his own grasp than those\ngreat and important articles to which attention has been already drawn;\nbut one, nevertheless, on which he was able to expend the whole amount\nof his energy and genius. Some people may think that an all-rounder is\nan all-rounder, and that if one is careful to get an all-rounder one has\ndone all that is necessary. But so thought not Macassar Jones. Some\nmen wear collars of two plies of linen, some men of three; but Macassar\nJones wore collars of four plies. Some men--some sensual, self-indulgent\nmen--appear to think that the collar should be made for the neck; but\nMacassar Jones knew better. He, who never spared him self when the cause\nwas good, he knew that the neck had been made for the collar--it was at\nany rate evident that such was the case with his own. Little can be said\nof his head, except that it was small, narrow, and genteel; but his hat\nmight be spoken of, and perhaps with advantage. Of the loose but studied\ntie of his inch-wide cravat a paragraph might be made; but we would fain\nnot be tedious.\n\n\"We will only further remark that he always carried with him a wonderful\nrepresentation of himself, like to him to a miracle, only smaller in its\ndimensions, like as a duodecimo is to a folio--a babe, as it were, of\nhis own begetting--a little _alter ego_ in which he took much delight.\nIt was his umbrella. Look at the delicate finish of its lower extremity;\nlook at the long, narrow, and well-made coat in which it is enveloped\nfrom its neck downwards, without speck, or blemish, or wrinkle; look at\nthe little wooden head, nicely polished, with the effigy of a human face\non one side of it--little eyes it has, and a sort of nose; look closer\nat it, and you will perceive a mouth, not expressive indeed, but still\nit is there--a mouth and chin; and is it, or is it not, an attempt at a\npair of whiskers? It certainly has a moustache.\n\n\"Such were Mr. Macassar Jones and his umbrella. He was an excellent\nclerk, and did great credit to the important office to which he was\nattached--namely, that of the Episcopal Audit Board. He was much beloved\nby the other gentlemen who were closely connected with him in that\nestablishment; and may be said, for the first year or two of his\nservice, to have been, not exactly the life and soul, but, we may\nperhaps say with more propriety, the pervading genius of the room in\nwhich he sat.\n\n\"But, alas! at length a cloud came over his brow. At first it was but\na changing shadow; but it settled into a dark veil of sorrow which\nobscured all his virtues, and made the worthy senior of his room shake\nhis thin grey locks once and again. He shook them more in sorrow than in\nanger; for he knew that Macassar was in love, and he remembered the\ndays of his youth. Yes; Macassar was in love. He had seen the lovely\nCrinoline. To see was to admire; to admire was to love; to love--that\nis, to love her, to love Crinoline, the exalted, the sought-after, the\none so much in demand, as he had once expressed himself to one of\nhis bosom friends--to love her was to despair. He did despair; and\ndespairing sighed, and sighing was idle.\n\n\"But he was not all idle. The genius of the man had that within it\nwhich did not permit itself to evaporate in mere sighs. Sighs, with the\nhigh-minded, force themselves into the guise of poetry, and so it had\nbeen with him. He got leave of absence for a week, and shut himself\nup alone in his lodgings; for a week in his lodgings, during the long\nevenings of winter, did he remain unseen and unheard of. His landlady\nthought that he was in debt, and his friends whispered abroad that he\nhad caught scarlatina. But at the end of the seven days he came forth,\npale indeed, but with his countenance lighted up by ecstatic fire,\nand as he started for his office, he carefully folded and put into\nhis pocket the elegantly written poem on which he had been so intently\nengaged.\"\n\n'I'm so glad we are to have more poetry,' said Katie. 'Is it another\nsong?'\n\n'You'll see,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n\"Macassar had many bosom friends at his office, to all of whom, one by\none, he had confided the tale of his love. For a while he doubted to\nwhich of them he should confide the secret of his inspiration; but\ngenius will not hide its head under a bushel; and thus, before long, did\nMacassar's song become the common property of the Episcopal Audit Board.\nEven the Bishops sang it, so Macassar was assured by one of his brother\nclerks who was made of a coarser clay than his colleague--even the\nBishops sang it when they met in council together on their own peculiar\nbench.\n\n\"It would be useless to give the whole of it here; for it contained\nten verses. The last two were those which Macassar was wont to sing to\nhimself, as he wandered lonely under the elms of Kensington Gardens.\n\n  \"'Oh, how she walks,\n    And how she talks,\n  And sings like a bird serene;\n    But of this be sure\n    While the world shall endure,\n  The loveliest lady that'll ever be seen\n  Will still be the Lady Crinoline,\n  The lovely Lady Crinoline.\n\n  \"'With her hair done all _\u00c3\u00a0 l'imp\u00c3\u00a9ratrice_,\n    Sweetly done with the best of grease,\n  She looks like a Goddess or Queen,--\n    And so I declare,\n    And solemnly swear,\n  That the loveliest lady that ever was seen\n  Is still the Lady Crinoline,\n  The lovely Lady Crinoline.'\"\n\n'And so ends the third chapter,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\nBoth Katie and Linda were beginning to criticize, but Mrs. Woodward\nrepressed them sternly, and went on with\n\n\"CHAPTER IV\n\n\"'It was a lovely day towards the end of May that Macassar Jones,\npresenting himself before the desk of the senior clerk at one o'clock,\nbegged for permission to be absent for two hours. The request was\npreferred with meek and hesitating voice, and with downcast eyes.\n\n\"The senior clerk shook his grey locks sadly! sadly he shook his thin\ngrey locks, for he grieved at the sight which he saw. 'Twas sad to see\nthe energies of this young man thus sapped in his early youth by the\nall-absorbing strength of a hopeless passion. Crinoline was now, as it\nwere, a household word at the Episcopal Audit Board. The senior clerk\nbelieved her to be cruel, and as he knew for what object these two hours\nof idleness were requested, he shook his thin grey locks in sorrow.\n\n\"'I'll be back at three, sir, punctual,' said Macassar.\n\n\"'But, Mr. Jones, you are absent nearly every day for the same period.'\n\n\"'To-day shall be the last; to-day shall end it all,' said Macassar,\nwith a look of wretched desperation.\n\n\"'What--what would Sir Gregory say?' said the senior clerk.\n\n\"Macassar Jones sighed deeply. Nature had not made the senior clerk a\ncruel man; but yet this allusion _was_ cruel. The young Macassar\nhad drunk deeply of the waters that welled from the fountain of Sir\nGregory's philosophy. He had been proud to sit humbly at the feet of\nsuch a Gamaliel; and now it rent his young heart to be thus twitted with\nthe displeasure of the great master whom he so loved and so admired.\n\n\"'Well, go, Mr. Jones,' said the senior clerk, 'go, but as you go,\nresolve that to-morrow you will remain at your desk. Now go, and may\nprosperity attend you!'\n\n\"'All shall be decided to-day,' said Macassar, and as he spoke an\nunusual spark gleamed in his eye. He went, and as he went the senior\nclerk shook his thin grey hairs. He was a bachelor, and he distrusted\nthe charms of the sex.\n\n\"Macassar, returning to his desk, took up his hat and his umbrella, and\nwent forth. His indeed was a plight at which that old senior clerk might\nwell shake his thin grey hairs in sorrow, for Macassar was the victim of\nmysterious circumstances, which, from his youth upwards, had marked him\nout for a fate of no ordinary nature. The tale must now be told.\"\n\n'O dear!' said Linda; 'is it something horrid?'\n\n'I hope it is,' said Katie; 'perhaps he's already married to some old\nhag or witch.'\n\n'You don't say who his father and mother are; but I suppose he'll turn\nout to be somebody else's son,' said Linda.\n\n'He's a very nice young man for a small tea-party, at any rate,' said\nUncle Bat.\n\n\"The tale must now be told,\" continued Mrs. Woodward. \"In his early\nyears Macassar Jones had had a maiden aunt. This lady died--\"\n\n'Oh, mamma, if you read it in that way I shall certainly cry,' said\nKatie.\n\n'Well, my dear, if your heart is so susceptible you had better indulge\nit.' \"This lady died and left behind her----\"\n\n'What?' said Linda.\n\n'A diamond ring?' said Katie.\n\n'A sealed manuscript, which was found in a secret drawer?' suggested\nLinda.\n\n'Perhaps a baby,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n\"And left behind her a will----\"\n\n'Did she leave anything else?' asked Norman.\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen, if I am to be interrupted in this way, I really\nmust resign my task,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'we shall never get to bed.'\n\n'I won't say another word,' said Katie.\n\n\"In his early years Macassar had had a maiden aunt. This lady died and\nleft behind her a will, in which, with many expressions of the warmest\naffection and fullest confidence, she left \u00c2\u00a33,000 in the three per\ncents----\"\n\n'What are the three per cents?' said Katie.\n\n'The three per cents is a way in which people get some of their money\nto spend regularly, when they have got a large sum locked up somewhere,'\nsaid Linda.\n\n'Oh!' said Katie.\n\n'Will you hold your tongue, miss?' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n\"Left \u00c2\u00a33,000 in the three per cents to her nephew. But she left it on\nthese conditions, that he should be married before he was twenty-five,\nand that he should have a child lawfully born in the bonds of wedlock\nbefore he was twenty-six. And then the will went on to state that the\ninterest of the money should accumulate till Macassar had attained the\nlatter age; and that in the event of his having failed to comply with\nthe conditions and stipulations above named, the whole money, principal\nand interest, should be set aside, and by no means given up to the said\nMacassar, but applied to the uses, purposes, and convenience of that\nexcellent charitable institution, denominated the Princess Charlotte's\nLying-in Hospital.\n\n\"Now the nature of this will had been told in confidence by Macassar\nto some of his brother clerks, and was consequently well known at\nthe Episcopal Audit Board. It had given rise there to a spirit of\nspeculation against which the senior clerk had protested in vain. Bets\nwere made, some in favour of Macassar, and some in that of the hospital;\nbut of late the odds were going much against our hero. It was well known\nthat in three short months he would attain that disastrous age, which,\nif it found him a bachelor, would find him also denuded of his legacy.\nAnd then how short a margin remained for the second event! The odds\nwere daily rising against Macassar, and as he heard the bets offered and\ntaken at the surrounding desks, his heart quailed within him.\n\n\"And the lovely Crinoline, she also had heard of this eccentric will;\nshe and her mother. \u00c2\u00a33,000 with interest arising for some half score\nof years would make a settlement by no means despicable in Tavistock\nSquare, and would enable Macassar to maintain a house over which even\nCrinoline need not be ashamed to preside. But what if the legacy should\nbe lost! She also knew to a day what was the age of her swain; she knew\nhow close upon her was that day, which, if she passed it unwedded, would\nsee her resolved to be deaf for ever to the vows of Macassar. Still, if\nshe managed well, there might be time--at any rate for the marriage.\n\n\"But, alas! Macassar made no vows; none at least which the most\nattentive ear could consider to be audible. Crinoline's ear was\nattentive, but hitherto in vain. He would come there daily to Tavistock\nSquare; daily would that true and valiant page lay open the path to his\nmistress's feet; daily would Macassar sit there for a while and sigh.\nBut the envious hour would pass away, while the wished-for word was\nstill unsaid; and he would hurry back, and complete with figures, too\noften erroneous, the audit of some diocesan balance.\n\n\"'You must help him, my dear,' said Crinoline's mamma.\n\n\"'But he says nothing, mamma,' said Crinoline in tears.\n\n\"'You must encourage him to speak, my dear.'\n\n\"'I do encourage him; but by that time it is always three o'clock, and\nthen he has to go away.'\n\n\"'You should be quicker, my dear. You should encourage him more at once.\nNow try to-day; if you can't do anything to-day I really must get your\npapa to interfere.'\n\n\"Crinoline had ever been an obedient child, and now, as ever, she\ndetermined to obey. But it was a hard task for her. In three months he\nwould be twenty-five--in fifteen months twenty-six. She, however, would\ndo her best; and then, if her efforts were unavailing, she could only\ntrust to Providence and her papa.\n\n\"With sad and anxious heart did Macassar that day take up his new silk\nhat, take up also his darling umbrella, and descend the sombre steps\nof the Episcopal Audit Office. 'Seven to one on the Lying-in,' were the\nlast words which reached his ears as the door of his room closed behind\nhim. His was a dreadful position. What if that sweet girl, that angel\nwhom he so worshipped, what if she, melted by his tale of sorrow--that\nis, if he could prevail on himself to tell it--should take pity, and\nconsent to be hurried prematurely to the altar of Hymen; and then if,\nafter all, the legacy should be forfeited! Poverty for himself he could\nendure; at least he thought so; but poverty for her! could he bear that?\nWhat if he should live to see her deprived of that green headdress,\nrobbed of those copious draperies, reduced to English shoes, compelled\nto desert that shrine in Hanover Square, and all through him! His brain\nreeled round, his head swam, his temples throbbed, his knees knocked\nagainst each other, his blood stagnated, his heart collapsed, a cold\nclammy perspiration covered him from head to foot; he could hardly\nreach the courtyard, and there obtain the support of a pillar. Dreadful\nthoughts filled his mind; the Thames, the friendly Thames, was running\nclose to him; should he not put a speedy end to all his misery? Those\nhorrid words, that 'seven to one on the Lying-in,' still rang in his\nears; were the chances really seven to one against his getting his\nlegacy? 'Oh!' said he, 'my aunt, my aunt, my aunt, my aunt, my aunt!'\n\n\"But at last he roused the spirit of the man within him. 'Faint heart\nnever won fair lady,' seemed to be whispered to him from every stone in\nSomerset House. The cool air blowing through the passages revived him,\nand he walked forth through the wide portals, resolving that he would\nreturn a happy, thriving lover, or that he would return no more--that\nnight. What would he care for Sir Gregory, what for the thin locks of\nthe senior clerk, if Crinoline should reject him?\n\n\"It was his custom, as he walked towards Tavistock Square, to stop at a\nfriendly pastry-cook's in Covent Garden, and revive his spirits for the\ncoming interview with Banbury tarts and cherry-brandy. In the moments\nof his misery something about the pastry-cook's girl, something that\nreminded him of Crinoline, it was probably her nose, had tempted him\nto confide to her his love. He had told her everything; the kind young\ncreature pitied him, and as she ministered to his wants, was wont to ask\nsweetly as to his passion.\n\n\"'And how was the lovely Lady Crinoline yesterday?' asked she. He had\nentrusted to her a copy of his poem.\n\n\"'More beauteous than ever,' he said, but somewhat indistinctly, for his\nmouth was clogged with the Banbury tart.\n\n\"'And good-natured, I hope. Indeed, I don't know how she can resist,'\nsaid the girl; 'I'm sure you'll make it all right to-day, for I see\nyou've got your winning way with you.'\n\n\"Winning way, with seven to one against him! Macassar sighed, and spilt\nsome of his cherry-brandy over his shirt front. The kind-hearted girl\ncame and wiped it for him. 'I think I'll have another glass,' said he,\nwith a deep voice. He did take another glass--and also ate another tart.\n\n\"'He'll pop to-day as sure as eggs, now he's taken them two glasses of\npopping powder,' said the girl, as he went out of the shop. 'Well, it's\nastonishing to me what the men find to be afraid of.'\n\n\"And so Macassar hastened towards Tavistock Square, all too quickly;\nfor, as he made his way across Great Russell Street, he found that he\nwas very hot. He leant against the rail, and, taking off his hat\nand gloves, began to cool himself, and wipe away the dust with his\npocket-handkerchief. 'I wouldn't have minded the expense of a cab,' said\nhe to himself, 'only the chances are so much against me: seven to one!'\n\n\"But he had no time to lose. He had had but two precious hours at\nhis disposal, and thirty minutes were already gone. He hurried on to\nTavistock Square, and soon found that well-known door open before him.\n\n\"'The Lady Crinoline sits upstairs alone,' said the page, 'and is\na-thinking of you.' Then he added in a whisper, 'Do you go at her\nstraight, Mr. Macassar; slip-slap, and no mistake.'\n\n\"All honour to the true and brave!\n\n\"CHAPTER V\n\n\"As Macassar walked across the drawing-room, Crinoline failed to\nperceive his presence, although his boots did creak rather loudly.\nSuch at least must be presumed to have been the case, for she made\nno immediate sign of having noticed him. She was sitting at the open\nwindow, with her lute in hand, gazing into the vacancy of the square\nbelow; and as Macassar walked across the room, a deep sigh escaped from\nher bosom. The page closed the door, and at the same moment Crinoline\ntouched her lute, or rather pulled it at the top and bottom, and threw\none wild witch note to the wind. As she did so, a line of a song escaped\nfrom her lips with a low, melancholy, but still rapturous cadence--\n\n  'His heart is at his office, his heart is _always_ there.'\n\n\"'Oh, Mr. Macassar, is that you?' she exclaimed. She struggled to rise,\nbut, finding herself unequal to the effort, she sank back again on a\nchair, dropped her lute on a soft footstool, and then buried her face in\nher hands. It was dreadful for Macassar to witness such agony.\n\n\"'Is anything the matter?' said he.\n\n\"'The matter!' said she. 'Ah! ah!'\n\n\"'I hope you are not sick?' said he.\n\n\"'Sick!' said she. 'Well, I fear I am very sick.'\n\n\"'What is it?' said he. 'Perhaps only bilious,' he suggested.\n\n\"'Oh! oh! oh!' said she.\n\n\"'I see I'm in the way; and I think I had better go,' and so he prepared\nto depart. 'No! no! no!' said she, jumping up from her chair. 'Oh! Mr.\nMacassar, don't be so cruel. Do you wish to see me sink on the carpet\nbefore your feet?'\n\n\"Macassar denied the existence of any such wish; and said that he humbly\nbegged her pardon if he gave any offence.\n\n\"'Offence!' said she, smiling sweetly on him; sweetly, but yet sadly.\n'Offence! no--no offence. Indeed, I don't know how you could--but never\nmind--I am such a silly thing. One's feelings will sometimes get the\nbetter of one; don't you often find it so?'\n\n\"'O yes! quite so,' said Macassar. 'I think it's the heat.'\n\n\"'He's a downright noodle,' said Crinoline's mamma to her sister-in-law,\nwho lived with them. The two were standing behind a chink in the door,\nwhich separated the drawing-room from a chamber behind it.\n\n\"'Won't you sit down, Mr. Macassar?' Macassar sat down. 'Mamma will be\nso sorry to miss you again. She's calling somewhere in Grosvenor Square,\nI believe. She wanted me to go with her; but I could not bring myself to\ngo with her to-day. It's useless for the body to go out, when the heart\nstill remains at home. Don't you find it so?'\n\n\"'Oh, quite so,' said Macassar. The cherry-brandy had already evaporated\nbefore the blaze of all that beauty, and he was bethinking himself how\nhe might best take himself off. Let the hospital have the filthy lucre!\nHe would let the money go, and would show the world that he loved for\nthe sake of love alone! He looked at his watch, and found that it was\nalready past two.\n\n\"Crinoline, when she saw that watch, knew that something must be done\nat once. She appreciated more fully than her lover did the value of this\nworld's goods; and much as she doubtless sympathized with the wants of\nthe hospital in question, she felt that charity should begin at home. So\nshe fairly burst out into a flood of tears.\n\n\"Macassar was quite beside himself. He had seen her weep before, but\nnever with such frightful violence. She rushed up from her chair,\nand passing so close to him as nearly to upset him by the waft of her\npetticoats, threw herself on to an ottoman, and hiding her face on the\nstump in the middle of it, sobbed and screeched, till Macassar feared\nthat the buttons behind her dress would crack and fly off.\n\n\"'Oh! oh! oh!' sobbed Crinoline.\n\n\"'It must be the heat,' said Macassar, knocking down a flower-pot in his\nattempt to open the window a little wider. 'O dear, what have I done?'\nsaid he. 'I think I'd better go.'\n\n\"'Never mind the flower-pot,' said Crinoline, looking up through her\ntears. 'Oh! oh! oh! oh! me. Oh! my heart.'\n\n\"Macassar looked at his watch. He had only forty-five minutes left for\neverything. The expense of a cab would, to be sure, be nothing if he\nwere successful; but then, what chance was there of that?\n\n\"'Can I do anything for you in the Strand?' said he. 'I must be at my\noffice at three.'\n\n\"'In the Strand!' she screeched. 'What could he do for me in the Strand?\nHeartless--heartless--heartless! Well, go--go--go to your office, Mr.\nMacassar; your heart is there, I know. It is always there. Go--don't let\nme stand between you and your duties--between you and Sir Gregory. Oh!\nhow I hate that man! Go! why should I wish to prevent you? Of course I\nhave no such wish. To me it is quite indifferent; only, mamma will be\nso sorry to miss you. You don't know how mamma loves you. She loves you\nalmost as a son. But go--go; pray go!'\n\n\"And then Crinoline looked at him. Oh! how she looked at him! It was\nas though all the goddesses of heaven were inviting him to come and eat\nambrosia with them on a rosy-tinted cloud. All the goddesses, did we\nsay? No, but one goddess, the most beautiful of them all. His heart beat\nviolently against his ribs, and he felt that he was almost man enough\nfor anything. Instinctively his hand went again to his waistcoat pocket.\n\n\"'You shan't look at your watch so often,' said she, putting up her\ndelicate hand and stopping his. 'There, I'll look at it for you. It's\nonly just two, and you needn't go to your office for this hour;' and\nas she squeezed it back into his pocket, he felt her fingers pressing\nagainst his heart, and felt her hair--done all _\u00c3\u00a0 l'imp\u00c3\u00a9ratrice_--in\nsweet contact with his cheek. 'There, I shall hold it there,' said she,\n'so that you shan't look at it again.'\n\n\"'Will you stay till I bid you go?' said Crinoline.\n\n\"Macassar declared that he did not care a straw for the senior clerk, or\nfor Sir Gregory either. He would stay there for ever, he said.\n\n\"'What! for ever in mamma's drawing-room?' said Crinoline, opening wide\nher lovely eyes with surprise.\n\n\"'For ever near to you,' said Macassar.\n\n\"'Oh, Mr. Macassar,' said Crinoline, dropping her hand from his\nwaistcoat, and looking bashfully towards the ground, 'what can you\nmean?'\n\n\"Down went Macassar on his knees, and down went Crinoline into her\nchair. There was perhaps rather too much distance between them, but\nthat did not much matter now. There he was on both knees, with his hands\nclasped together as they were wont to be when he said his prayers, with\nhis umbrella beside him on one side, and his hat on the other, making\nhis declaration in full and unmistakable terms. A yard or two of floor,\nmore or less, between them, was neither here nor there. At first the\nbashful Crinoline could not bring herself to utter a distinct consent,\nand Macassar was very nearly up and away, in a returning fit of despair.\nBut her good-nature came to his aid; and as she quickly said, 'I will,\nI will, I will,' he returned to his posture in somewhat nearer quarters,\nand was transported into the seventh heaven by the bliss of kissing her\nhand.\n\n\"'Oh, Macassar!' said she.\n\n\"'Oh, Crinoline!' said he.\n\n\"'You must come and tell papa to-morrow,' said she.\n\n\"He readily promised to do so.\n\n\"'You had better come to breakfast; before he goes into the city,' said\nshe.\n\n\"And so the matter was arranged, and the lovely Lady Crinoline became\nthe affianced bride of the happy Macassar.\n\n\"It was past three when he left the house, but what did he care for\nthat? He was so mad with joy that he did not even know whither he was\ngoing. He went on straight ahead, and came to no check, till he found\nhimself waving his hat over his head in the New Road. He then began to\nconceive that his conduct must have been rather wild, for he was brought\nto a stand-still in a crossing by four or five cabmen, who were rival\ncandidates for his custom.\n\n\"'Somerset House, old brick!' he shouted out, as he jumped into a\nhansom, and as he did so he poked one of the other cabbies playfully in\nthe ribs with his umbrella.\n\n\"'Is mamma don't know as 'ow 'e's hout, I shouldn't vonder,' said the\ncabman--and away went Macassar, singing at the top of his voice as he\nsat in the cab--\n\n  'The loveliest lady that ever was seen\n  Is the lovely Lady Crinoline.'\n\n\"The cab passed through Covent Garden on its way. 'Stop at the\npastry-cook's at the corner,' said Macassar up through the little\ntrap-door. The cab drew up suddenly. 'She's mine, she's mine!' shouted\nMacassar, rushing into the shop, and disregarding in the ecstasy of the\nmoment the various customers who were quietly eating their ices. 'She's\nmine, she's mine!\n\n  With her hair done all _\u00c3\u00a1 l'imp\u00c3\u00a9ratrice_,\n  Sweetly done with the best of grease.\n\nAnd now for Somerset House.'\n\n\"Arrived at those ancient portals, he recklessly threw eighteenpence to\nthe cabman, and ran up the stone stairs which led to his office. As he\ndid so the clock, with iron tongue, tolled four. But what recked he\nwhat it tolled? He rushed into his room, where his colleagues were\nnow locking their desks, and waving abroad his hat and his umbrella,\nrepeated the chorus of his song. 'She's mine, she's mine--\n\n  The loveliest lady that ever was seen\n  Is the lovely Lady Crinoline;\n\nand she's mine, she's mine!'\n\n\"Exhausted nature could no more. He sank into a chair, and his brother\nclerks stood in a circle around him. Soon a spirit of triumph seemed to\nactuate them all; they joined hands in that friendly circle, and dancing\nwith joyful glee, took up with one voice the burden of the song--\n\n    'Oh how she walks,\n    And how she talks,\n  And sings like a bird serene,\n    But of this be sure,\n    While the world shall endure,\n  The loveliest lady that ever was seen\n    Is still the Lady Crinoline--\n    The lovely Lady Crinoline.'\n\n\"And that old senior clerk with the thin grey hair--was he angry at this\ngeneral ebullition of joy? O no! The just severity of his discipline was\nalways tempered with genial mercy. Not a word did he say of that broken\npromise, not a word of the unchecked diocesan balance, not a word of Sir\nGregory's anger. He shook his thin grey locks; but he shook them neither\nin sorrow nor in anger. 'God bless you, Macassar Jones,', said he, 'God\nbless you!'\n\n\"He too had once been young, had once loved, had once hoped and feared,\nand hoped again, and had once knelt at the feet of beauty. But alas! he\nhad knelt in vain.\n\n\"'May God be with you, Macassar Jones,' said he, as he walked out of the\noffice door with his coloured bandana pressed to his eyes. 'May God be\nwith you, and make your bed fruitful!'\n\n  \"'For the loveliest lady that ever was seen\n    Is the lovely Lady Crinoline,'\n\nshouted the junior clerks, still dancing in mad glee round the happy\nlover.\n\n\"We have said that they all joined in this kindly congratulation to\ntheir young friend. But no. There was one spirit there whom envy had\nsoured, one whom the happiness of another had made miserable, one whose\nheart beat in no unison with these jocund sounds. As Macassar's joy was\nat its height, in the proud moment of his triumph, a hated voice struck\nhis ears, and filled his soul with dismay once more.\n\n\"'There's two to one still on the Lying-in,' said this hateful Lucifer.\n\n\"And so Macassar was not all happy even yet, as he walked home to his\nlodgings.\n\n\"CHAPTER VI\n\n\"We have but one other scene to record, but one short scene, and then\nour tale will be told and our task will be done. And this last scene\nshall not, after the usual manner of novelists, be that of the wedding,\nbut rather one which in our eyes is of a much more enduring interest.\nCrinoline and Macassar were duly married in Bloomsbury Church. The\ndresses are said to have come from the house in Hanover Square.\nCrinoline behaved herself with perfect propriety, and Macassar went\nthrough his work like a man. When we have said that, we have said all\nthat need be said on that subject.\n\n\"But we must beg our readers to pass over the space of the next twelve\nmonths, and to be present with us in that front sitting-room of the\nelegant private lodgings, which the married couple now prudently\noccupied in Alfred Place. Lodgings! yes, they were only lodgings; for\nnot as yet did they know what might be the extent of their income.\n\n\"In this room during the whole of a long autumn day sat Macassar in a\nframe of mind not altogether to be envied. During the greater portion of\nit he was alone; but ever and anon some bustling woman would enter and\ndepart without even deigning to notice the questions which he asked. And\nthen after a while he found himself in company with a very respectable\ngentleman in black, who belonged to the medical profession. 'Is it\ncoming?' asked Macassar. 'Is it, is it coming?'\n\n\"'Well, we hope so--we hope so,' said the medical gentleman. 'If not\nto-day, it will be to-morrow. If I should happen to be absent, Mrs.\nGamp is all that you could desire. If not to-day, it will certainly be\nto-morrow,'--and so the medical gentleman went his way.\n\n\"Now the coming morrow would be Macassar's birthday. On that morrow he\nwould be twenty-six.\n\n\"All alone he sat there till the autumn sun gave way to the shades of\nevening. Some one brought him a mutton chop, but it was raw and he could\nnot eat; he went to the sideboard and prepared to make himself a glass\nof negus, but the water was all cold. His water at least was cold,\nthough Mrs. Gamp's was hot enough. It was a sad and mournful evening. He\nthought he would go out, for he found that he was not wanted; but a low\ndrizzling rain prevented him. Had he got wet he could not have changed\nhis clothes, for they were all in the wardrobe in his wife's room.\nAll alone he sat till the shades of evening were hidden by the veil of\nnight.\n\n\"But what sudden noise is that he hears within the house? Why do those\nheavy steps press so rapidly against the stairs? What feet are they\nwhich are so busy in the room above him? He opens the sitting-room door,\nbut he can see nothing. He has been left there without a candle. He\npeers up the stairs, but a faint glimmer of light shining through the\nkeyhole of his wife's door is all that meets his eye. 'Oh, my aunt! my\naunt!' he says as he leans against the banisters. 'My aunt, my aunt, my\naunt!'\n\n\"What a birthday will this be for him on the morrow! He already hears\nthe sound of the hospital bells as they ring with joy at the acquisition\nof their new wealth; he must dash from his lips, tear from his heart,\nbanish for ever from his eyes, that vision of a sweet little cottage at\nBrompton, with a charming dressing-room for himself, and gas laid on all\nover the house.\n\n\"'Lodgings! I hate, I detest lodgings!' he said to himself. 'Connubial\nbliss and furnished lodgings are not compatible. My aunt, my aunt, for\nwhat misery hast thou not to answer! Oh, Mrs. Gamp, could you be so\nobliging as to tell me what o'clock it is?' The last question was asked\nas Mrs. Gamp suddenly entered the room with a candle. Macassar's watch\nhad been required for the use of one of the servants.\n\n\"'It's just half-past heleven, this wery moment as is,' said Mrs. Gamp;\n'and the finest boy babby as my heyes, which has seen a many, has ever\nsat upon.'\n\n\"Up, up to the ceiling went the horsehair cushion of the lodging-house\nsofa--up went the footstool after it, and its four wooden legs in\nfalling made a terrible clatter on the mahogany loo-table. Macassar in\nhis joy got hold of Mrs. Gamp, and kissed her heartily, forgetful of the\nfumes of gin. 'Hurrah!' shouted he,' hurrah, hurrah, hurrah! Oh, Mrs.\nGamp, I feel so--so--so--I really don't know how I feel.'\n\n\"He danced round the room with noisy joy, till Mrs. Gamp made him\nunderstand how very unsuited were such riotous ebullitions to the weak\nstate of his lady-love upstairs. He then gave over, not the dancing but\nthe noise, and went on capering round the room with suppressed steps,\never and anon singing to himself in a whisper,\n\n  'The loveliest lady that ever was seen\n  Is still the Lady Crinoline.'\n\n\"A few minutes afterwards a knock at the door was heard, and the monthly\nnurse entered. She held something in her embrace; but he could not see\nwhat. He looked down pryingly into her arms, and at the first glance\nthought that it was his umbrella. But then he heard a little pipe, and\nhe knew that it was his child.\n\n\"We will not intrude further on the first interview between Macassar and\nhis heir.\"\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n'And so ends the romantic history of \"Crinoline and Macassar\",' said\nMrs. Woodward; 'and I am sure, Charley, we are all very much obliged to\nyou for the excellent moral lessons you have given us.'\n\n'I'm so delighted with it,' said Katie; 'I do so like that Macassar.'\n\n'So do I,' said Linda, yawning; 'and the old man with the thin grey\nhair.'\n\n'Come, girls, it's nearly one o'clock, and we'll go to bed,' said the\nmother. 'Uncle Bat has been asleep these two hours.'\n\nAnd so they went off to their respective chambers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nSURBITON COLLOQUIES\n\n\nAll further conversation in the drawing-room was forbidden for that\nnight. Mrs. Woodward would have willingly postponed the reading of\nCharley's story so as to enable Katie to go to bed after the accident,\nhad she been able to do so. But she was not able to do so without an\nexercise of a species of authority which was distasteful to her, and\nwhich was very seldom heard, seen, or felt within the limits of Surbiton\nCottage. It would moreover have been very ungracious to snub Charley's\nmanuscript, just when Charley had made himself such a hero; and she\nhad, therefore, been obliged to read it. But now that it was done, she\nhurried Katie off to bed, not without many admonitions.\n\n'Good night,' she said to Charley; 'and God bless you, and make you\nalways as happy as we are now. What a household we should have had\nto-night, had it not been for you!'\n\nCharley rubbed his eyes with his hand, and muttered something about\nthere not having been the slightest danger in the world.\n\n'And remember, Charley,' she said, paying no attention to his\nmutterings, 'we always liked you--liked you very much; but liking and\nloving are very different things. Now you are a dear, dear friend--one\nof the dearest.'\n\nIn answer to this, Charley was not even able to mutter; so he went his\nway to the inn, and lay awake half the night thinking how Katie had\nkissed his hand: during the other half he dreamt, first that Katie was\ndrowned, and then that Norah was his bride.\n\nLinda and Katie had been so hurried off, that they had only been just\nable to shake hands with Harry and Charley. There is, however, an old\nproverb, that though one man may lead a horse to water, a thousand\ncannot make him drink. It was easy to send Katie to bed, but very\ndifficult to prevent her talking when she was there.\n\n'Oh, Linda,' she said, 'what can I do for him?'\n\n'Do for him?' said Linda; 'I don't know that you can do anything for\nhim. I don't suppose he wants you to do anything.' Linda still looked\non her sister as a child; but Katie was beginning to put away childish\nthings.\n\n'Couldn't I make something for him, Linda--something for him to keep as\na present, you know? I would work so hard to get it done.'\n\n'Work a pair of slippers, as Crinoline did,' said Linda.\n\nKatie was brushing her hair at the moment, and then she sat still with\nthe brush in her hand, thinking. 'No,' said she, after a while, 'not a\npair of slippers--I shouldn't like a pair of slippers.'\n\n'Why not?' said Linda.\n\n'Oh--I don't know--but I shouldn't.' Katie had said that Crinoline was\nworking slippers for Macassar because she was in love with him; and\nhaving said so, she could not now work slippers for Charley. Poor Katie!\nshe was no longer a child when she thought thus.\n\n'Then make him a purse,' said Linda.\n\n'A purse is such a little thing.'\n\n'Then work him the cover for a sofa, like what mamma and I are doing for\nGertrude.'\n\n'But he hasn't got a house,' said Katie.\n\n'He'll have a house by the time you've done the sofa, and a wife to sit\non it too.'\n\n'Oh, Linda, you are so ill-natured.'\n\n'Why, child, what do you want me to say? If you were to give him one\nof those grand long tobacco pipes they have in the shop windows, that's\nwhat he'd like the best; or something of that sort. I don't think he\ncares much for girls' presents, such as purses and slippers.'\n\n'Doesn't he?' said Katie, mournfully.\n\n'No; not a bit. You know he's such a rake.'\n\n'Oh! Linda; I don't think he's so very bad, indeed I don't; and mamma\ndoesn't think so; and you know Harry said on Easter Sunday that he was\nmuch better than he used to be.'\n\n'I know Harry is very good-natured to him.'\n\n'And isn't Charley just as good-natured to Harry? I am quite sure he is.\nHarry has only to ask the least thing, and Charley always does it.\nDo you remember how Charley went up to town for him the Sunday before\nlast?'\n\n'And so he ought,' said Linda. 'He ought to do whatever Harry tells\nhim.'\n\n'Well, Linda, I don't know why he ought,' said Katie. 'They are not\nbrothers, you know, nor yet even cousins.'\n\n'But Harry is very--so very--so very superior, you know,' said Linda.\n\n'I don't know any such thing,' said Katie.\n\n'Oh! Katie, don't you know that Charley is such a rake?'\n\n'But rakes are just the people who don't do whatever they are told;\nso that's no reason. And I am quite sure that Charley is much the\ncleverer.'\n\n'And I am quite sure he is not--nor half so clever; nor nearly so well\neducated. Why, don't you know the navvies are the most ignorant young\nmen in London? Charley says so himself.'\n\n'That's his fun,' said Katie: 'besides, he always makes little of\nhimself. I am quite sure Harry could never have made all that about\nMacassar and Crinoline out of his own head.'\n\n'No! because he doesn't think of such nonsensical things. I declare,\nMiss Katie, I think you are in love with Master Charley.'\n\nKatie, who was still sitting at the dressing-table, blushed up to her\nforehead; and at the same time her eyes were suffused with tears. But\nthere was no one to see either of those tell-tale symptoms, for Linda\nwas in bed.\n\n'I know he saved my life,' said Katie, as soon as she could trust\nherself to speak without betraying her emotion--'I know he jumped into\nthe river after me, and very, very nearly drowned himself; and I don't\nthink any other man in the world would have done so much for me besides\nhim.'\n\n'Oh, Katie! Harry would in a moment.'\n\n'Not for me; perhaps he might for you--though I'm not quite sure that he\nwould.' It was thus that Katie took her revenge on her sister.\n\n'I'm quite sure he would for anybody, even for Sally.' Sally was an\nassistant in the back kitchen. 'But I don't mean to say, Katie, that you\nshouldn't feel grateful to Charley; of course you should.'\n\n'And so I do,' said Katie, now bursting out into tears, overdone by her\nemotion and fatigue; 'and so I do--and I do love him, and will love him,\nif he's ever so much a rake! But you know, Linda, that is very different\nfrom being in love; and it was very ill-natured of you to say so, very.'\n\nLinda was out of bed in a trice, and sitting with her arm round her\nsister's neck.\n\n'Why, you darling little foolish child, you! I was only quizzing,' said\nshe. 'Don't you know that I love Charley too?'\n\n'But you shouldn't quiz about such a thing as that. If you'd fallen into\nthe river, and Harry had pulled you out, then you'd know what I mean;\nbut I'm not at all sure that he could have done it.'\n\nKatie's perverse wickedness on this point was very nearly giving rise\nto another contest between the sisters. Linda's common sense, however,\nprevailed, and giving up the point of Harry's prowess, she succeeded at\nlast in getting Katie into bed. 'You know mamma will be so angry if she\nhears us,' said Linda, 'and I am sure you will be ill to-morrow.'\n\n'I don't care a bit about being ill to-tomorrow; and yet I do too,' she\nadded, after a pause, 'for it's Sunday. It would be so stupid not to be\nable to go out to-morrow.'\n\n'Well, then, try to go to sleep at once'--and Linda carefully tucked the\nclothes around her sister.\n\n'I think it shall be a purse,' said Katie.\n\n'A purse will certainly be the best; that is, if you don't like the\nslippers,' and Linda rolled herself up comfortably in the bed.\n\n'No--I don't like the slippers at all. It shall be a purse. I can\ndo that the quickest, you know. It's so stupid to give a thing when\neverything about it is forgotten, isn't it?'\n\n'Very stupid,' said Linda, nearly asleep.\n\n'And when it's worn out I can make another, can't I?'\n\n'H'm'm'm,' said Linda, quite asleep.\n\nAnd then Katie went asleep also, in her sister's arms.\n\nEarly in the morning--that is to say, not very early, perhaps between\nseven and eight--Mrs. Woodward came into their room, and having\ninspected her charges, desired that Katie should not get up for morning\nchurch, but lie in bed till the middle of the day.\n\n'Oh, mamma, it will be so stupid not going to church after tumbling into\nthe river; people will say that all my clothes are wet.'\n\n'People will about tell the truth as to some of them,' said Mrs.\nWoodward; 'but don't you mind about people, but lie still and go to\nsleep if you can. Linda, do you come and dress in my room.'\n\n'And is Charley to lie in bed too?' said Katie. 'He was in the river\nlonger than I was.'\n\n'It's too late to keep Charley in bed,' said Linda, 'for I see him\ncoming along the road now with a towel; he's been bathing.'\n\n'Oh, I do so wish I could go and bathe,' said Katie.\n\nPoor Katie was kept in bed till the afternoon. Charley and Harry,\nhowever, were allowed to come up to her bedroom door, and hear her\npronounce herself quite well.\n\n'How d'ye do, Mr. Macassar?' said she.\n\n'And how d'ye do, my Lady Crinoline?' said Harry. After that Katie never\ncalled Charley Mr. Macassar again.\n\nThey all went to church, and Katie was left to sleep or read, or think\nof the new purse that she was to make, as best she might.\n\nAnd then they dined, and then they walked out; but still without Katie.\nShe was to get up and dress while they were out, so as to receive\nthem in state in the drawing-room on their return. Four of them walked\ntogether; for Uncle Bat now usually took himself off to his friend at\nHampton Court on Sunday afternoon. Mrs. Woodward walked with Charley,\nand Harry and Linda paired together.\n\n'Now,' said Charley to himself, 'now would have been the time to have\ntold Mrs. Woodward everything, but for that accident of yesterday. Now\nI can tell her nothing; to do so now would be to demand her sympathy and\nto ask for assistance;' and so he determined to tell her nothing.\n\nBut the very cause which made Charley dumb on the subject of his own\ndistresses made Mrs. Woodward inquisitive about them. She knew that his\nlife was not like that of Harry--steady, sober, and discreet; but\nshe felt that she did not like him, or even love him the less on this\naccount. Nay, it was not clear to her that these failings of his did not\ngive him additional claims on her sympathies. What could she do for him?\nhow could she relieve him? how could she bring him back to the\nright way? She spoke to him of his London life, praised his talents,\nencouraged him to exertion, besought him to have some solicitude, and,\nabove all, some respect for himself. And then, with that delicacy which\nsuch a woman, and none but such a woman, can use in such a matter, she\nasked him whether he was still in debt.\n\nCharley, with shame we must own it, had on this subject been false to\nall his friends. He had been false to his father and his mother, and\nhad never owned to them the half of what he owed; he had been false to\nAlaric, and false to Harry; but now, now, at such a moment as this, he\nwould not allow himself to be false to Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'he was in debt--rather.'\n\nMrs. Woodward pressed him to say whether his debts were heavy--whether\nhe owed much.\n\n'It's no use thinking of it, Mrs. Woodward,' said he; 'not the least. I\nknow I ought not to come down here; and I don't think I will any more.'\n\n'Not come down here!' said Mrs. Woodward. 'Why not? There's very little\nexpense in that. I dare say you'd spend quite as much in London.'\n\n'Oh--of course--three times as much, perhaps; that is, if I had it--but\nI don't mean that.'\n\n'What do you mean?' said she.\n\nCharley walked on in silence, with melancholy look, very crestfallen,\nhis thumbs stuck into his waistcoat pockets.\n\n'Upon my word I don't know what you mean,' said Mrs. Woodward. 'I should\nhave thought coming to Hampton might perhaps--perhaps have kept you--I\ndon't exactly mean out of mischief.' That, however, in spite of her\ndenial, was exactly what Mrs. Woodward did mean.\n\n'So it does--but--' said Charley, now thoroughly ashamed of himself.\n\n'But what?' said she.\n\n'I am not fit to be here,' said Charley; and as he spoke his manly\nself-control all gave way, and big tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nMrs. Woodward, in her woman's heart, resolved, that if it might in any\nway be possible, she would make him fit, fit not only to be there, but\nto hold his head up with the best in any company in which he might find\nhimself.\n\nShe questioned him no further then. Her wish now was not to torment him\nfurther, but to comfort him. She determined that she would consult with\nHarry and with her uncle, and take counsel from them as to what steps\nmight be taken to save the brand from the burning. She talked to him as\na mother might have done, leaning on his arm, as she returned; leaning\non him as a woman never leans on a man whom she deems unfit for her\nsociety. All this Charley's heart and instinct fully understood, and he\nwas not ungrateful.\n\nBut yet he had but little to comfort him. He must return to town on\nMonday; return to Mr. Snape and the lock entries, to Mr. M'Ruen and\nthe three Seasons--to Mrs. Davis, Norah Geraghty, and that horrid Mr.\nPeppermint. He never once thought of Clementina Golightly, to whom at\nthat moment he was being married by the joint energies of Undy Scott and\nhis cousin Alaric.\n\nAnd what had Linda and Norman been doing all this time? Had they been\nplacing mutual confidence in each other? No; they had not come to that\nyet. Linda still remembered the pang with which she had first heard of\nGertrude's engagement, and Harry Norman had not yet been able to open\nhis seared heart to a second love.\n\nIn the course of the evening a letter was brought to Captain Cuttwater,\nwhich did not seem to raise his spirits.\n\n'Whom is your letter from, uncle?' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'From Alaric,' said he, gruffly, crumpling it up and putting it into his\npocket. And then he turned to his rum and water in a manner that showed\nhis determination to say nothing more on the matter.\n\nIn the morning Harry and Charley returned to town. Captain Cuttwater\nwent up with them; and all was again quiet at Surbiton Cottage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nMR. M'BUFFER ACCEPTS THE CHILTERN HUNDREDS\n\n\nIt was an anxious hour for the Honourable Undecimus Scott when he first\nlearnt that Mr. M'Buffer had accepted the Stewardship of the Chiltern\nHundreds. The Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds! Does it never occur\nto anyone how many persons are appointed to that valuable situation? Or\ndoes anyone ever reflect why a Member of Parliament, when he wishes\nto resign his post of honour, should not be simply gazetted in the\nnewspapers as having done so, instead of being named as the new Steward\nof the Chiltern Hundreds? No one ever does think of it; resigning and\nbecoming a steward are one and the same thing, with this difference,\nhowever, that one of the grand bulwarks of the British constitution is\nthus preserved.\n\nWell, Mr. M'Buffer, who, having been elected by the independent electors\nof the Tillietudlem burghs to serve them in Parliament, could not, in\naccordance with the laws of the constitution, have got himself out of\nthat honourable but difficult position by any scheme of his own, found\nhimself on a sudden a free man, the Queen having selected him to be her\nsteward for the district in question. We have no doubt but that the deed\nof appointment set forth that her Majesty had been moved to this step\nby the firm trust she had in the skill and fidelity of the said Mr.\nM'Buffer; but if so her Majesty's trust would seem to have been somewhat\nmisplaced, as Mr. M'Buffer, having been a managing director of a\nbankrupt swindle, from which he had contrived to pillage some thirty or\nforty thousand pounds, was now unable to show his face at Tillietudlem,\nor in the House of Commons; and in thus retreating from his membership\nhad no object but to save himself from the expulsion which he feared.\nIt was, however, a consolation for him to think that in what he had done\nthe bulwarks of the British constitution had been preserved.\n\nIt was an anxious moment for Undy. The existing Parliament had still\na year and a half, or possibly two years and a half, to run. He had\nalready been withdrawn from the public eye longer than he thought\nwas suitable to the success of his career. He particularly disliked\nobscurity for he had found that in his case obscurity had meant\ncomparative poverty. An obscure man, as he observed early in life, had\nnothing to sell. Now, Undy had once had something to sell, and a very\ngood market he had made of it. He was of course anxious that those\nhalcyon days should return. Fond of him as the electors of Tillietudlem\nno doubt were, devoted as they might be in a general way to his\ninterests still, still it was possible that they might forget him, if he\nremained too long away from their embraces. 'Out of sight out of mind'\nis a proverb which opens to us the worst side of human nature. But even\nat Tillietudlem nature's worst side might sometimes show itself.\n\nActuated by such feelings as these, Undy heard with joy the tidings of\nM'Buffer's stewardship, and determined to rush to the battle at once.\nBattle he knew there must be. To be brought in for the district of\nTillietudlem was a prize which had never yet fallen to any man's\nlot without a contest. Tillietudlem was no poor pocket borough to be\ndisposed of, this way or that way, according to the caprice or venal\ncall of some aristocrat. The men of Tillietudlem knew the value of their\nvotes, and would only give them according to their consciences. The way\nto win these consciences, to overcome the sensitive doubts of a free and\nindependent Tillietudlem elector, Undy knew to his cost.\n\nIt was almost a question, as he once told Alaric, whether all that he\ncould sell was worth all that he was compelled to buy. But having put\nhis neck to the collar in this line of life, he was not now going to\nwithdraw. Tillietudlem was once more vacant, and Undy determined to try\nit again, undaunted by former outlays. To make an outlay, however, at\nany rate, in electioneering matters, it is necessary that a man should\nhave in hand some ready cash; at the present moment Undy had very\nlittle, and therefore the news of Mr. M'Buffer's retirement to the\nGerman baths for his health was not heard with unalloyed delight.\n\nHe first went into the city, as men always do when they want money;\nthough in what portion of the city they find it, has never come to the\nauthor's knowledge. Charley Tudor, to be sure, did get \u00c2\u00a35 by going to\nthe 'Banks of Jordan;' but the supply likely to be derived from such\na fountain as that would hardly be sufficient for Undy's wants. Having\ndone what he could in the city, he came to Alaric, and prayed for the\nassistance of all his friend's energies in the matter. Alaric would not\nhave been, and was not unwilling to assist him to the extent of his own\nimmediate means; but his own immediate means were limited, and Undy's\ndesire for ready cash was almost unlimited.\n\nThere was a certain railway or proposed railway in Ireland, in which\nUndy had ventured very deeply, more so indeed than he had deemed it\nquite prudent to divulge to his friend; and in order to gain certain\nends he had induced Alaric to become a director of this line. The line\nin question was the Great West Cork, which was to run from Skibbereen to\nBantry, and the momentous question now hotly debated before the Railway\nBoard was on the moot point of a branch to Ballydehob. If Undy could\ncarry the West Cork and Ballydehob branch entire, he would make a pretty\nthing of it; but if, as there was too much reason to fear, his Irish\nfoes should prevail, and leave--as Undy had once said in an eloquent\nspeech at a very influential meeting of shareholders--and leave the\nunfortunate agricultural and commercial interest of Ballydehob steeped\nin Cimmerian darkness, the chances were that poor Undy would be well\nnigh ruined.\n\nSuch being the case, he had striven, not unsuccessfully, to draw Alaric\ninto the concern. Alaric had bought very cheaply a good many shares,\nwhich many people said were worth nothing, and had, by dint of Undy's\nmachinations, been chosen a director on the board. Undy himself\nmeanwhile lay by, hoping that fortune might restore him to Parliament,\nand haply put him on that committee which must finally adjudicate as to\nthe great question of the Ballydehob branch.\n\nSuch were the circumstances under which he came to Alaric with the\nview of raising such a sum of money as might enable him to overcome the\nscruples of the Tillietudlem electors, and place himself in the shoes\nlately vacated by Mr. M'Buffer.\n\nThey were sitting together after dinner when he commenced the subject.\nHe and Mrs. Val and Clementina had done the Tudors the honour of dining\nwith them; and the ladies had now gone up into the drawing-room, and\nwere busy talking over the Chiswick affair, which was to come off in\nthe next week, and after which Mrs. Val intended to give a small evening\nparty to the most _\u00c3\u00a9lite_ of her acquaintance.\n\n'We won't have all the world, my dear,' she had said to Gertrude, 'but\njust a few of our own set that are really nice. Clementina is dying to\ntry that new back step with M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe, so we won't crowd the room.'\nSuch were the immediate arrangements of the Tudor and Scott party.\n\n'So M'Buffer is off at last,' said Scott, as he seated himself and\nfilled his glass, after closing the dining-room door. 'He brought his\npigs to a bad market after all.'\n\n'He was an infernal rogue,' said Alaric.\n\n'Well, I suppose he was,' said Undy; 'and a fool into the bargain to be\nfound out.'\n\n'He was a downright swindler,' said Alaric.\n\n'After all,' said the other, not paying much attention to Alaric's\nindignation, 'he did not do so very badly. Why, M'Buffer has been at it\nnow for thirteen years. He began with nothing; he had neither blood nor\nmoney; and God knows he had no social merits to recommend him. He is\nas vulgar as a hog, as awkward as an elephant, and as ugly as an ape.\nI believe he never had a friend, and was known at his club to be the\ngreatest bore that ever came out of Scotland; and yet for thirteen\nyears he has lived on the fat of the land; for five years he has been\nin Parliament, his wife has gone about in her carriage, and every man in\nthe city has been willing to shake hands with him.'\n\n'And what has it all come to?' said Alaric, whom the question of\nM'Buffer's temporary prosperity made rather thoughtful.\n\n'Well, not so bad either; he has had his fling for thirteen years, and\nthat's something. Thirteen good years out of a man's life is more\nthan falls to the lot of every one. And then, I suppose, he has saved\nsomething.'\n\n'And he is spoken of everywhere as a monster for whom hanging is too\ngood.'\n\n'Pshaw! that won't hang him. Yesterday he was a god; to-day he is a\ndevil; to-morrow he'll be a man again; that's all.'\n\n'But you don't mean to tell me, Undy, that the consciousness of such\ncrimes as those which M'Buffer has committed must not make a man\nwretched in this world, and probably in the next also?'\n\n'Judge not, and ye shall not be judged,' said Undy, quoting Scripture as\nthe devil did before him; 'and as for consciousness of crime, I suppose\nM'Buffer has none at all. I have no doubt he thinks himself quite as\nhonest as the rest of the world. He firmly believes that all of us\nare playing the same game, and using the same means, and has no idea\nwhatever that dishonesty is objectionable.'\n\n'And you, what do you think about it yourself?'\n\n'I think the greatest rogues are they who talk most of their honesty;\nand, therefore, as I wish to be thought honest myself, I never talk of\nmy own.'\n\nThey both sat silent for a while, Undy bethinking himself what arguments\nwould be most efficacious towards inducing Alaric to strip himself of\nevery available shilling that he had; and Alaric debating in his own\nmind that great question which he so often debated, as to whether men,\nmen of the world, the great and best men whom he saw around him, really\nendeavoured to be honest, or endeavoured only to seem so. Honesty was\npreached to him on every side; but did he, in his intercourse with the\nworld, find men to be honest? Or did it behove him, a practical man like\nhim, a man so determined to battle with the world as he had determined,\ndid it behove such a one as he to be more honest than his neighbours?\n\nHe also encouraged himself by that mystic word, 'Excelsior!' To him it\nwas a watchword of battle, repeated morning, noon, and night. It was the\nprevailing idea of his life. 'Excelsior'! Yes; how great, how grand, how\nall-absorbing is the idea! But what if a man may be going down, down to\nTophet, and yet think the while that he is scaling the walls of heaven?\n\n'But you wish to think yourself honest,' he said, disturbing Undy\njust as that hero had determined on the way in which he would play his\npresent hand of cards.\n\n'I have not the slightest difficulty about that,' said Undy; 'and I dare\nsay you have none either. But as to M'Buffer, his going will be a great\nthing for us, if, as I don't doubt, I can get his seat.'\n\n'It will be a great thing for you,' said Alaric, who, as well as Undy,\nhad his Parliamentary ambition.\n\n'And for you too, my boy. We should carry the Ballydehob branch to a\ndead certainty; and even if we did not do that, we'd bring it so near it\nthat the expectation of it would send the shares up like mercury in fine\nweather. They are at \u00c2\u00a32 12s. 6d. now, and, if I am in the House next\nSession, they'll be up to \u00c2\u00a37 10s. before Easter; and what's more, my\ndear fellow, if we can't help ourselves in that way, they'll be worth\nnothing in a very few months.'\n\nAlaric looked rather blank; for he had invested deeply in this line, of\nwhich he was now a director, of a week's standing, or perhaps we should\nsay sitting. He had sold out all his golden hopes in the Wheal Mary\nJane for the sake of embarking his money and becoming a director in this\nIrish Railway, and in one other speculation nearer home, of which Undy\nhad a great opinion, viz.: the Limehouse Thames Bridge Company.\nSuch being the case, he did not like to hear the West Cork with the\nBallydehob branch spoken of so slightingly.\n\n'The fact is, a man can do anything if he is in the House, and he can\ndo nothing if he is not,' said Undy. 'You know our old Aberdeen saying,\n'You scratch me and I'll scratch you.' It is not only what a man may do\nhimself for himself, but it is what others will do for him when he is\nin a position to help them. Now, there are those fellows; I am\nhand-and-glove with all of them; but there is not one of them would\nlift a finger to help me as I am now; but let me get my seat again, and\nthey'll do for me just anything I ask them. Vigil moves the new writ\nto-night; I got a line from him asking me whether I was ready. There was\nno good to be got by waiting, so I told him to fire away.'\n\n'I suppose you'll go down at once?' said Alaric.\n\n'Well, that as may be--at least, yes; that's my intention. But there's\none thing needful--and that is the needful.'\n\n'Money?' suggested Alaric.\n\n'Yes, money--cash--rhino--tin--ready--or by what other name the goddess\nwould be pleased to have herself worshipped; money, sir; there's the\ndifficulty, now as ever. Even at Tillietudlem money will have its\nweight.'\n\n'Can't your father assist you?' said Alaric.\n\n'My father! I wonder how he'd look if he got a letter from me asking for\nmoney. You might as well expect a goose to feed her young with blood out\nof her own breast, like a pelican, as expect that a Scotch lord should\ngive money to his younger sons like an English duke. What would my\nfather get by my being member for Tillietudlem? No; I must look nearer\nhome than my father. What can you do for me?'\n\n'I?'\n\n'Yes, you,' said Undy; 'I am sure you don't mean to say you'll refuse to\nlend me a helping hand if you can. I must realize by the Ballydehobs, if\nI am once in the House; and then you'd have your money back at once.'\n\n'It is not that,' said Alaric; 'but I haven't got it.'\n\n'I am sure you could let me have a thousand or so,' said Undy. 'I think\na couple of thousand would carry it, and I could make out the other\nmyself.'\n\n'Every shilling I have,' said Alaric, 'is either in the Ballydehobs or\nin the Limehouse Bridge. Why don't you sell yourself?'\n\n'So I have,' said Undy; 'everything that I can without utter ruin. The\nBallydehobs are not saleable, as you know.'\n\n'What can I do for you, then?'\n\nUndy set himself again to think. 'I have no doubt I could get a thousand\non our joint names. That blackguard, M'Ruen, would do it.'\n\n'Who is M'Ruen?' asked Alaric.\n\n'A low blackguard of a discounting Jew Christian. He would do it;\nbut then, heaven knows what he would charge, and he'd make so many\ndifficulties that I shouldn't have the money for the next fortnight.'\n\n'I wouldn't have my name on a bill in such a man's hands on any\naccount,' said Alaric.\n\n'Well, I don't like it myself,' said Undy; 'but what the deuce am I\nto do? I might as well go to Tillietudlem without my head as without\nmoney.'\n\n'I thought you'd kept a lot of the Mary Janes,' said Alaric.\n\n'So I had, but they're gone now. I tell you I've managed \u00c2\u00a31,000 myself.\nIt would murder me now if the seat were to go into other hands. I'd get\nthe Committee on the Limehouse Bridge, and we should treble our money.\nVigil told me he would not refuse the Committee, though of course the\nGovernment won't consent to a grant if they can help it.'\n\n'Well, Undy, I can let you have \u00c2\u00a3250, and that is every shilling I have\nat my banker's.'\n\n'They would not let you overdraw a few hundreds?' suggested Undy.\n\n'I certainly shall not try them,' said Alaric.\n\n'You are so full of scruple, so green, so young,' said Undy, almost in\nan enthusiasm of remonstrance. 'What can be the harm of trying them?'\n\n'My credit.'\n\n'Fal lal. What's the meaning of credit? How are you to know whether you\nhave got any credit if you don't try? Come, I'll tell you how you can do\nit. Old Cuttwater would lend it you for the asking.'\n\nTo this proposition Alaric at first turned a deaf ear; but by degrees\nhe allowed Undy to talk him over. Undy showed him that if he lost the\nTillietudlem burghs on this occasion it would be useless for him\nto attempt to stand for them again. In such case, he would have no\nalternative at the next general election but to stand for the borough of\nStrathbogy in Aberdeenshire; whereas, if he could secure Tillietudlem\nas a seat for himself, all the Gaberlunzie interest in the borough\nof Strathbogy, which was supposed to be by no means small, should be\ntransferred to Alaric himself. Indeed, Sandie Scott, the eldest hope of\nthe Gaberlunzie family, would, in such case, himself propose Alaric\nto the electors. Ca'stalk Cottage, in which the Hon. Sandie lived, and\nwhich was on the outskirts of the Gaberlunzie property, was absolutely\nwithin the boundary of the borough.\n\nOvercome by these and other arguments, Alaric at last consented to ask\nfrom Captain Cuttwater the loan of \u00c2\u00a3700. That sum Undy had agreed to\naccept as a sufficient contribution to that desirable public object,\nthe re-seating himself for the Tillietudlem borough, and as Alaric on\nreflection thought that it would be uncomfortable to be left penniless\nhimself, and as it was just as likely that Uncle Bat would lend him\n\u00c2\u00a3700 as \u00c2\u00a3500, he determined to ask for a loan of the entire sum. He\naccordingly did so, and the letter, as we have seen, reached the captain\nwhile Harry and Charley were at Surbiton Cottage. The old gentleman was\nanything but pleased. In the first place he liked his money, though not\nwith any overweening affection; in the next place, he had done a great\ndeal for Alaric, and did not like being asked to do more; and lastly,\nhe feared that there must be some evil cause for the necessity of such a\nloan so soon after Alaric's marriage.\n\nAlaric in making his application had not done so actually without making\nany explanation on the subject. He wrote a long letter, worded very\ncleverly, which only served to mystify the captain, as Alaric had\nintended that it should do. Captain Cuttwater was most anxious that\nAlaric, whom he looked on as his adopted son, should rise in the world;\nhe would have been delighted to think that he might possibly live to\nsee him in Parliament; would probably have made considerable pecuniary\nsacrifice for such an object. With the design, therefore, of softening\nCaptain Cuttwater's heart, Alaric in his letter had spoken about\ngreat changes that were coming, of the necessity that there was of his\nstirring himself, of the great pecuniary results to be expected from a\nsmall present expenditure; and ended by declaring that the money was\nto be used in forwarding the election of his friend Scott for the\nTillietudlem district burghs.\n\nNow, the fact was, that Uncle Bat, though he cared a great deal for\nAlaric, did not care a rope's end for Undy Scott, and could enjoy his\nrum-punch just as keenly if Mr. Scott was in obscurity as he could\npossibly hope to do even if that gentleman should be promoted to be\na Lord of the Treasury. He was not at all pleased to think that his\nhard-earned moidores should run down the gullies of the Tillietudlem\nboroughs in the shape of muddy ale or vitriolic whisky; and yet this was\nthe first request that Alaric had ever made to him, and he did not like\nto refuse Alaric's first request. So he came up to town himself on the\nfollowing morning with Harry and Charley, determined to reconcile all\nthese difficulties by the light of his own wisdom.\n\nIn the evening he returned to Surbiton Cottage, having been into the\ncity, sold out stock for \u00c2\u00a3700, and handed over the money to Alaric\nTudor.\n\nOn the following morning Undy Scott set out for Scotland, properly\nfreighted, Mr. Whip Vigil having in due course moved for a new writ for\nthe Tillietudlem borough in the place of Mr. M'Buffer, who had accepted\nthe situation of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nCHISWICK GARDENS\n\n\nThe following Thursday was as fine as a Chiswick flower-show-day ought\nto be, and so very seldom is. The party who had agreed to congregate\nthere--the party, that is, whom we are to meet--was very select. Linda\nand Katie had come up to spend a few days with their sister. Mrs. Val,\nClementina, Gertrude, and Linda were to go in a carriage, for which\nAlaric was destined to pay, and which Mrs. Val had hired, having\nselected it regardless of expense, as one which, by its decent exterior\nand polished outward graces, conferred on its temporary occupiers an\nagreeable appearance of proprietorship. The two Miss Neverbends, sisters\nof Fidus, were also to be with them, and they with Katie followed\nhumbly, as became their station, in a cab, which was not only hired, but\nwhich very vulgarly told the fact to all the world.\n\nSlight as had been the intimacy between Fidus Neverbend and Alaric at\nTavistock, nevertheless a sort of friendship had since grown up between\nthem. Alaric had ascertained that Fidus might in a certain degree be\nuseful to him, that the good word of the Aristides of the Works and\nBuildings might be serviceable, and that, in short, Neverbend was worth\ncultivating. Neverbend, on the other hand, when he perceived that\nTudor was likely to become a Civil Service hero, a man to be named\nwith glowing eulogy at all the Government Boards in London, felt\nunconsciously a desire to pay him some of that reverence which a mortal\nalways feels for a god. And thus there was formed between them a sort of\nalliance, which included also the ladies of the family.\n\nNot that Mrs. Val, or even Mrs. A. Tudor, encountered Lactimel and\nUgolina Neverbend on equal terms. There is a distressing habitual\nhumility in many unmarried ladies of an uncertain age, which at the\nfirst blush tells the tale against them which they are so painfully\nanxious to leave untold. In order to maintain their places but yet\na little longer in that delicious world of love, sighs, and dancing\npartners, from which it must be so hard for a maiden, with all her\nyouthful tastes about her, to tear herself for ever away, they smile and\nsay pretty things, put up with the caprices of married women, and play\nsecond fiddle, though the doing so in no whit assists them in their\ntask. Nay, the doing so does but stamp them the more plainly with that\nhorrid name from which they would so fain escape. Their plea is for\nmercy--'Have pity on me, have pity on me; put up with me but for one\nother short twelve months; and then, if then I shall still have failed,\nI will be content to vanish from the world for ever.' When did such\nplea for pity from one woman ever find real entrance into the heart of\nanother?\n\nOn such terms, however, the Misses Neverbend were content to follow Mrs.\nVal to the Chiswick flower-show, and to feed on the crumbs which might\nchance to fall from the rich table of Miss Golightly; to partake of\nbroken meat in the shape of cast-off adorers, and regale themselves with\nlukewarm civility from the outsiders in the throng which followed that\nadorable heiress.\n\nAnd yet the Misses Neverbend were quite as estimable as the divine\nClementina, and had once been, perhaps, as attractive as she is now.\nThey had never waltzed, it is true, as Miss Golightly waltzes. It may\nbe doubted, indeed, whether any lady ever did. In the pursuit of that\namusement Ugolina was apt to be stiff and ungainly, and to turn herself,\nor allow herself to be turned, as though she were made of wood; she\nwas somewhat flat in her figure, looking as though she had been\nuncomfortably pressed into an unbecoming thinness of substance, and a\ncorresponding breadth of surface, and this conformation did not assist\nher in acquiring a graceful flowing style of motion. The elder sister,\nLactimel, was of a different form, but yet hardly more fit to shine\nin the mazes of the dance than her sister. She had her charms,\nnevertheless, which consisted of a somewhat stumpy dumpy comeliness. She\nwas altogether short in stature, and very short below the knee. She had\nfair hair and a fair skin, small bones and copious soft flesh. She had a\ntrick of sighing gently in the evolutions of the waltz, which young men\nattributed to her softness of heart, and old ladies to her shortness\nof breath. They both loved dancing dearly, and were content to enjoy\nit whenever the chance might be given to them by the aid of Miss\nGolightly's crumbs.\n\nThe two sisters were as unlike in their inward lights as in their\noutward appearance. Lactimel walked ever on the earth, but Ugolina never\ndeserted the clouds. Lactimel talked prose and professed to read it;\nUgolina read poetry and professed to write it. Lactimel was utilitarian.\n_Cui bono_?--though probably in less classic phrase--was the question\nshe asked as to everything. Ugolina was transcendental, and denied that\nthere could be real good in anything. Lactimel would have clothed and\nfed the hungry and naked, so that all mankind might be comfortable.\nUgolina would have brought mankind back to their original nakedness, and\nhave taught them to feed on the grasses of the field, so that the claims\nof the body, which so vitally oppose those of the mind, might remain\nunheeded and despised. They were both a little nebulous in their\ndoctrines, and apt to be somewhat unintelligible in their discourse,\nwhen indulged in the delights of unrestrained conversation. Lactimel had\na theory that every poor brother might eat of the fat and drink of\nthe sweet, might lie softly, and wear fine linen, if only some body\nor bodies could be induced to do their duties; and Ugolina was equally\nstrong in a belief that if the mind were properly looked to,\nall appreciation of human ill would cease. But they delighted in\ngeneralizing rather than in detailed propositions; and had not probably,\neven in their own minds, realized any exact idea as to the means by\nwhich the results they desired were to be brought about.\n\nThey toadied Mrs. Val--poor young women, how little should they be\nblamed for this fault, which came so naturally to them in their forlorn\nposition!--they toadied Mrs. Val, and therefore Mrs. Val bore with them;\nthey bored Gertrude, and Gertrude, for her husband's sake, bore with\nthem also; they were confidential with Clementina, and Clementina, of\ncourse, snubbed them. They called Clementina 'the sweetest creature.'\nLactimel declared that she was born to grace the position of a wife and\nmother, and Ugolina swore that her face was perfect poetry. Whereupon\nClementina laughed aloud, and elegantly made a grimace with her nose and\nmouth, as she turned the 'perfect poetry' to her mother. Such were\nthe ladies of the party who went to the Chiswick flower-show, and who\nafterwards were to figure at Mrs. Val's little evening 'the dansant,' at\nwhich nobody was to be admitted who was not nice.\n\nThey were met at the gate of the Gardens by a party of young men, of\nwhom Victoire Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe was foremost. Alaric and Charley were to come\ndown there when their office work was done. Undy was by this time on his\nroad to Tillietudlem; and Captain Val was playing billiards at his club.\nThe latter had given a promise that he would make his appearance--a\npromise, however, which no one expected, or wished him to keep.\n\nThe happy Victoire was dressed up to his eyes. That, perhaps, is not\nsaying much, for he was only a few feet high; but what he wanted in\nquantity he fully made up in quality. He was a well-made, shining,\njaunty little Frenchman, who seemed to be perfectly at ease with\nhimself and all the world. He had the smallest little pair of moustaches\nimaginable, the smallest little imperial, the smallest possible pair of\nboots, and the smallest possible pair of gloves. Nothing on earth could\nbe nicer, or sweeter, or finer, than he was. But he did not carry his\nfinery like a hog in armour, as an Englishman so often does when an\nEnglishman stoops to be fine. It sat as naturally on Victoire as though\nhe had been born in it. He jumped about in his best patent leather\nboots, apparently quite heedless whether he spoilt them or not; and\nwhen he picked up Miss Golightly's parasol from the gravel, he seemed to\nsuffer no anxiety about his gloves.\n\nHe handed out the ladies one after another, as though his life had been\npassed in handing out ladies, as, indeed, it probably had--in handing\nthem out and handing them in; and when Mrs. Val's 'private' carriage\npassed on, he was just as courteous to the Misses Neverbend and Katie in\ntheir cab, as he had been to the greater ladies who had descended from\nthe more ambitious vehicle. As Katie said afterwards to Linda, when she\nfound the free use of her voice in their own bedroom, 'he was a darling\nlittle duck of a man, only he smelt so strongly of tobacco.'\n\nBut when they were once in the garden, Victoire had no time for\nanyone but Mrs. Val and Clementina. He had done his duty by the Misses\nNeverbend and those other two insipid young English girls, and now he\nhad his own affairs to look after. He also knew that Miss Golightly had\n\u00c2\u00a320,000 of her own!\n\nHe was one of those butterfly beings who seem to have been created that\nthey may flutter about from flower to flower in the summer hours of such\ngala times as those now going on at Chiswick, just as other butterflies\ndo. What the butterflies were last winter, or what will become of them\nnext winter, no one but the naturalist thinks of inquiring. How they may\nfeed themselves on flower-juice, or on insects small enough to be their\nprey, is matter of no moment to the general world. It is sufficient that\nthey flit about in the sunbeams, and add bright glancing spangles to the\nbeauty of the summer day.\n\nAnd so it was with Victoire Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe. He did no work. He made no\nhoney. He appeared to no one in the more serious moments of life. He was\nthe reverse of Shylock; he would neither buy with you nor sell with you,\nbut he would eat with you and drink with you; as for praying, he did\nlittle of that either with or without company. He was clothed in purple\nand fine linen, as butterflies should be clothed, and fared sumptuously\neveryday; but whence came his gay colours, or why people fed him with\npate and champagne, nobody knew and nobody asked.\n\nLike most Frenchmen of his class, he never talked about himself. He\nunderstood life, and the art of pleasing, and the necessity that he\nshould please, too well to do so. All that his companions knew of him\nwas that he came from France, and that when the gloomy months came on in\nEngland, the months so unfitted for a French butterfly, he packed up his\nazure wings and sought some more genial climate, certain to return and\nbe seen again when the world of London became habitable.\n\nIf he had means of living no one knew it; if he was in debt no one ever\nheard of it; if he had a care in the world he concealed it. He abounded\nin acquaintances who were always glad to see him, and would have\nregarded it as quite de trop to have a friend. Nevertheless time was\nflying on with him as with others; and, butterfly as he was, the idea of\nMiss Golightly's \u00c2\u00a320,000 struck him with delightful amazement--500,000\nfrancs! 500,000 francs! and so he resolved to dance his very best, warm\nas the weather undoubtedly was at the present moment.\n\n'Ah, he was charmed to see madame and mademoiselle look so charmingly,'\nhe said, walking between mother and daughter, but paying apparently much\nthe greater share of attention to the elder lady. In this respect we\nEnglishmen might certainly learn much from the manners of our dear\nallies. We know well enough how to behave ourselves to our fair young\ncountrywomen; we can be civil enough to young women--nature teaches us\nthat; but it is so seldom that we are sufficiently complaisant to be\ncivil to old women. And yet that, after all, is the soul of gallantry.\nIt is to the sex that we profess to do homage. Our theory is, that\nfeminine weakness shall receive from man's strength humble and\nrespectful service. But where is the chivalry, where the gallantry,\nif we only do service in expectation of receiving such guerdon as rosy\ncheeks and laughing eyes can bestow?\n\nIt may be said that Victoire had an object in being civil to Mrs. Val.\nBut the truth is, all French Victoires are courteous to old ladies. An\nEnglishman may probably be as forward as a Frenchman in rushing into\na flaming building to save an old woman's life; but then it so rarely\nhappens that occasion offers itself for gallantry such as that. A man,\nhowever, may with ease be civil to a dozen old women in one day.\n\nAnd so they went on, walking through parterres and glass-houses, talking\nof theatres, balls, dinner-parties, picnics, concerts, operas, of ladies\nmarried and single, of single gentlemen who should be married, and of\nmarried gentlemen who should be single, of everything, indeed, except\nthe flowers, of which neither Victoire nor his companions took the\nslightest notice.\n\n'And madame really has a dance to-night in her own house?'\n\n'O yes,' said Mrs. Val; 'that is, just a few quadrilles and waltzes for\nClementina. I really hardly know whether the people will take the carpet\nup or no.' The people, consisting of the cook and housemaid--for the\npage had, of course, come with the carriage--were at this moment hard at\nwork wrenching up the nails, as Mrs. Val was very well aware.\n\n'It will be delightful, charming,' said Victoire.\n\n'Just a few people of our own set, you know,' said Mrs. Val: 'no crowd,\nor fuss, or anything of that sort; just a few people that we know are\nnice, in a quiet homely way.'\n\n'Ah, that is so pleasing,' said M. Victoire: 'that is just what I like;\nand is mademoiselle engaged for--?'\n\nNo. Mademoiselle was not engaged either for--or for--or for--&c., &c.,\n&c.; and then out came the little tablets, under the dome of a huge\ngreenhouse filled with the most costly exotics, and Clementina and her\nfellow-labourer in the cause of Terpsichore went to work to make their\narrangements for the evening.\n\nAnd the rest of the party followed them. Gertrude was accompanied by\nan Englishman just as idle and quite as useless as M. Victoire, of the\nbutterfly tribe also, but not so graceful, and without colour.\n\nAnd then came the Misses Neverbend walking together, and with them, one\non each side, two tall Frenchmen, whose faces had been remodelled in\nthat mould into which so large a proportion of Parisians of the present\nday force their heads, in order that they may come out with some look\nof the Emperor about them. Were there not some such machine as this in\noperation, it would be impossible that so many Frenchmen should appear\nwith elongated, angular, hard faces, all as like each other as though\nthey were brothers! The cut of the beard, the long prickly-ended,\nclotted moustache, which looks as though it were being continually\nrolled up in saliva, the sallow, half-bronzed, apparently unwashed\ncolour--these may all, perhaps, be assumed by any man after a certain\namount of labour and culture. But how it has come to pass that every\nParisian has been able to obtain for himself a pair of the Emperor's\nlong, hard, bony, cruel-looking cheeks, no Englishman has yet been able\nto guess. That having the power they should have the wish to wear this\nmask is almost equally remarkable. Can it be that a political phase,\nwhen stamped on a people with an iron hand of sufficient power of\npressure, will leave its impress on the outward body as well as on the\ninward soul? If so, a Frenchman may, perhaps, be thought to have gained\nin the apparent stubborn wilfulness of his countenance some recompense\nfor his compelled loss of all political wilfulness whatever.\n\nBe this as it may, the two Misses Neverbend walked on, each with a\nstubborn long-faced Frenchman at her side, looking altogether not ill\npleased at this instance of the excellence of French manners. After them\ncame Linda, talking to some acquaintance of her own, and then poor dear\nlittle Katie with another Frenchman, sterner, more stubborn-looking,\nmore long-faced, more like the pattern after whom he and they had been\nremodelled, than any of them.\n\nPoor little Katie! This was her first day in public. With many imploring\ncaresses, with many half-formed tears in her bright eyes, with many\nassurances of her perfect health, she had induced her mother to allow\nher to come to the flower-show; to allow her also to go to Mrs. Val's\ndance, at which there were to be none but such very nice people. Katie\nwas to commence her life, to open her ball with this flower-show. In\nher imagination it was all to be one long bright flower-show, in which,\nhowever, the sweet sorrowing of the sensitive plant would ever and anon\ninvite her to pity and tears. When she entered that narrow portal she\nentered the world, and there she found herself walking on the well-mown\ngrass with this huge, stern, bearded Frenchman by her side! As to\ntalking to him, that was quite out of the question. At the gate some\nslight ceremony of introduction had been gone through, which had\nconsisted in all the Frenchmen taking off their hats and bowing to the\ntwo married ladies, and in the Englishmen standing behind and poking\nthe gravel with their canes. But in this no special notice had of course\nbeen taken of Katie; and she had a kind of idea, whence derived she knew\nnot, that it would be improper for her to talk to this man, unless she\nwere actually and _bona fide_ introduced to him. And then, again, poor\nKatie was not very confident in her French, and then her companion was\nnot very intelligible in his English; so when the gentleman asked, 'Is\nit that mademoiselle lofe de fleurs?' poor little Katie felt herself\ntremble, and tried in vain to mutter something; and when, again essaying\nto do his duty, he suggested that 'all de beaut\u00c3\u00a9 of Londres did delight\nto valk itself at Chisveek,' she was equally dumb, merely turning on him\nher large eyes for one moment, to show that she knew that he addressed\nher. After that he walked on as silent as herself, still keeping close\nto her side; and other ladies, who had not the good fortune to have male\ncompanions, envied her happiness in being so attended.\n\nBut Alaric and Charley were coming, she knew; Alaric was her\nbrother-in-law now, and therefore she would be delighted to meet him;\nand Charley, dear Charley! she had not seen him since he went away that\nmorning, now four days since; and four days was a long time, considering\nthat he had saved her life. Her busy little fingers had been hard at\nwork the while, and now she had in her pocket the purse which she had\nbeen so eager to make, and which she was almost afraid to bestow.\n\n'Oh, Linda,' she had said, 'I don't think I will, after all; it is such\na little thing.'\n\n'Nonsense, child, you wouldn't give him a worked counterpane; little\nthings are best for presents.'\n\n'But it isn't good enough,' she said, looking at her handiwork in\ndespair. But, nevertheless, she persevered, working in the golden beads\nwith constant diligence, so that she might be able to give it to Charley\namong the Chiswick flowers. Oh! what a place it was in which to bestow a\npresent, with all the eyes of all the world upon her!\n\nAnd then this dance to which she was going! The thought of what she\nwould do there troubled her. Would anyone ask her to dance? Would\nCharley think of her when he had so many grown-up girls, girls quite\ngrown up, all around him? It would be very sad if at this London party\nit should be her fate to sit down the whole evening and see others\ndance. It would suffice for her, she thought, if she could stand up with\nLinda, but she had an idea that this would not be allowed at a London\nparty; and then Linda, perhaps, might not like it. Altogether she had\nmuch upon her mind, and was beginning to think that, perhaps, she might\nhave been happier to have stayed at home with her mamma. She had not\nquite recovered from the effect of her toss into the water, or the\nconsequent excitement, and a very little misery would upset her. And so\nshe walked on with her Napoleonic companion, from whom she did not know\nhow to free herself, through one glass-house after another, across lawns\nand along paths, attempting every now and then to get a word with Linda,\nand not at all so happy as she had hoped to have been.\n\nAt last Gertrude came to her rescue. They were all congregated for a\nwhile in one great flower-house, and Gertrude, finding herself near her\nsister, asked her how she liked it all.\n\n'Oh! it is very beautiful,' said Katie, 'only--'\n\n'Only what, dear?'\n\n'Would you let me come with you a little while! Look here'--and she\ncrept softly around to the other side of her sister, sidling with little\nsteps away from the Frenchman, at whom, however, she kept furtively\nlooking, as though she feared that he would detect her in the act. 'Look\nhere, Gertrude,' she said, twitching her sister's arm; 'that gentleman\nthere--you see him, don't you? he's a Frenchman, and I don't know how to\nget away from him.'\n\n'How to get away from him?' said Gertrude. 'That's M. Delabarbe de\nl'Empereur, a great friend of Mrs. Val's, and a very quiet sort of man,\nI believe; he won't eat you.'\n\n'No, he won't eat me, I know; but I can't look at anything, because he\nwill walk so close to me! Mayn't I come with you?'\n\nGertrude told her she might, and so Katie made good her escape,\nhiding herself from her enemy as well as she could behind her sister's\npetticoats. He, poor man, was perhaps as rejoiced at the arrangement as\nKatie herself; at any rate he made no attempt to regain his prey, but\nwent on by himself, looking as placidly stern as ever, till he was\nabsorbed by Mrs. Val's more immediate party, and then he devoted himself\nto her, while M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe settled with Clementina the properest\narrangement for the waltzes of the evening.\n\nKatie was beginning to be tranquilly happy, and was listening to the\nenthusiasm of Ugolina Neverbend, who declared that flowers were the\nfemale poet's fitting food--it may be doubted whether she had ever\ntried it--when her heart leaped within her on hearing a sharp, clear,\nwell-known voice, almost close behind her. It was Charley Tudor. After\nher silent promenade with M. Delabarbe de l'Empereur, Katie had been\nwell pleased to put up with the obscure but yet endurable volubility of\nUgolina; but now she felt almost as anxious to get quit of Ugolina as\nshe had before been to shake off the Frenchman.\n\n'Flowers are Nature's chef-d'oeuvre,' said Ugolina; 'they convey to me\nthe purest and most direct essence of that heavenly power of production\nwhich is the sweetest evidence which Jehovah gives us of His presence.'\n\n'Do they?' said Katie, looking over her shoulder to watch what Charley\nwas doing, and to see whether he was coming to notice her.\n\n'They are the bright stars of His immediate handiwork,' said Ugolina;\n'and if our dim eyes could read them aright, they would whisper to us\nthe secret of His love.'\n\n'Yes, I dare say they would,' said Katie, who felt, perhaps, a little\ndisappointed because Charley lingered a while shaking hands with Mrs.\nVal and Clementina Golightly.\n\nIt was, however, but for a moment. There was much shaking of hands to be\ndone, and a considerable taking off of hats to be gone through; and as\nAlaric and Charley encountered the head of the column first, it was only\nnatural that they should work their way through it gradually. Katie,\nhowever, never guessed--how could she?--that Charley had calculated that\nby reaching her last he would be able to remain with her.\n\nShe was still listening to Ugolina, who was mounting higher and higher\nup to heaven, when she found her hand in Charley's. Ugolina might now\nmount up, and get down again as best she could, for Katie could no\nlonger listen to her.\n\nAlaric had not seen her yet since her ducking. She had to listen to\nand to answer his congratulations, Charley standing by and making his\ncomments.\n\n'Charley says you took to the water quite naturally, and swam like a\nduck,' said Alaric.\n\n'Only she went in head foremost,' said Charley.\n\n'All bathers ought to do that,' said Alaric; 'and tell me, Katie, did\nyou feel comfortable when you were in the water?'\n\n'Indeed I don't recollect anything about it,' said she, 'only that I saw\nCharley coming to me, just when I was going to sink for the last time.'\n\n'Sink! Why, I'm told that you floated like a deal board.'\n\n'The big hat and the crinoline kept her up,' said Charley; 'she had no\nidea of sinking.'\n\n'Oh! Charley, you know I was under the water for a long time; and that\nif you had not come, just at that very moment, I should never have come\nup again.'\n\nAnd then Alaric went on, and Charley and Katie were left together.\n\nHow was she to give him the purse? It was burning a hole in her\npocket till she could do so; and yet how was she to get it out of her\npossession into his, and make her little speech, here in the public\ngarden? She could have done it easily enough at home in the drawing-room\nat Surbiton Cottage.\n\n'And how do you like the gardens?' asked Charley.\n\n'Oh! they are beautiful; but I have hardly been able to see anything\nyet. I have been going about with a great big Frenchman--there, that\nman there--he has such a queer name.'\n\n'Did his name prevent your seeing?'\n\n'No, not his name; I didn't know his name then.\n\nBut it seemed so odd to be walking about with such a man as that. But I\nwant to go back, and look at the black and yellow roses in that house,\nthere. Would you go with me? that is, if we may. I wonder whether we\nmay!'\n\nCharley was clearly of opinion that they might, and should, and would;\nand so away they sallied back to the roses, and Katie began to enjoy\nthe first instalment of the happiness which she had anticipated. In the\ntemple of the roses the crowd at first was great, and she could not get\nthe purse out of her pocket, nor make her speech; but after a while\nthe people passed on, and there was a lull before others filled their\nplaces, and Katie found herself opposite to a beautiful black rose, with\nno one close to her but Charley.\n\n'I have got something for you,' she said; and as she spoke she felt\nherself to be almost hot with blushing.\n\n'Something for me!' said Charley; and he also felt himself abashed, he\ndid not know why.\n\n'It's only a very little thing,' said Katie, feeling in her pocket, 'and\nI am almost ashamed to ask you to take it. But I made it all myself; no\none else put a stitch in it,' and so saying, and looking round to see\nthat she was not observed, she handed her gift to Charley.\n\n'Oh! Katie, dearest Katie,' said he, 'I am so much obliged to you--I'll\nkeep it till I die.'\n\n'I didn't know what to make that was better,' said she.\n\n'Nothing on earth could possibly be better,' said he.\n\n'A plate of bread and butter and a purse are a very poor return for\nsaving one's life,' said she, half laughing, half crying.\n\nHe looked at her with his eyes full of love; and as he looked, he swore\nwithin himself that come what might, he would never see Norah Geraghty\nagain, but would devote his life to an endeavour to make himself worthy\nof the angel that was now with him. Katie the while was looking up\nanxiously into his face. She was thinking of no other love than that\nwhich it became her to feel for the man who had saved her life. She was\nthinking of no other love; but her young heart was opening itself to a\nvery different feeling. She was sinking deep, deep in waters which were\nto go near to drown her warm heart; much nearer than those other waters\nwhich she fancied had all but closed for ever over her life.\n\nShe looked into his face and saw that he was pleased; and that, for\nthe present, was enough for her. She was at any rate happy now. So\nthey passed on through the roses, and then lost themselves among the\ngeraniums, and wondered at the gigantic rhododendrons, and beautiful\nazaleas, and so went on from house to house, and from flower-bed to\nflower-bed, Katie talking and Charley listening, till she began to\nwonder at her former supineness, and to say both to herself and out loud\nto her companion, how very, very, very glad she was that her mother had\nlet her come.\n\nPoor Katie!--dear, darling, bonny Katie!--sweet sweetest, dearest\nchild! why, oh why, has that mother of thine, that tender-hearted loving\nmother, put thee unguarded in the way of such peril as this? Has she not\nsworn to herself that over thee at least she would watch as a hen does\nover her young, so that no unfortunate love should quench thy young\nspirit, or blanch thy cheek's bloom? Has she not trembled at the thought\nof what would have befallen thee, had thy fate been such as Linda's?\nHas she not often--oh, how often!--on her knees thanked the Almighty God\nthat Linda's spirit was not as thine; that this evil had happened to\nthe lamb whose temper had been fitted by Him to endure it? And yet--here\nthou art--all unguarded, all unaided, left by thyself to drink of the\ncup of sweet poison, and none near to warn thee that the draught is\ndeadly.\n\nAlas!--'twould be useless to warn thee now. The false god has been\nplaced upon the altar, the temple all shining with gems and gold has\nbeen built around him, the incense-cup is already swinging; nothing will\nnow turn the idolater from her worship, nothing short of a miracle.\n\nOur Katie's childish days are now all gone. A woman's passion glows\nwithin her breast, though as yet she has not scanned it with a woman's\nintelligence. Her mother, listening to a child's entreaty, had suffered\nher darling to go forth for a child's amusement. It was doomed that the\nchild should return no more; but in lieu of her, a fair, heart-laden\nmaiden, whose every fondest thought must henceforth be of a stranger's\nwelfare and a stranger's fate.\n\nBut it must not be thought that Charley abused the friendship of Mrs.\nWoodward, and made love to Katie, as love is usually made--with warm\nwords, assurances of affection, with squeezing of the hand, with sighs,\nand all a lover's ordinary catalogue of resources. Though we have said\nthat he was a false god, yet he was hardly to be blamed for the temple,\nand gems, and gold, with which he was endowed; not more so, perhaps,\nthan the unconscious bud which is made so sacred on the banks of the\nEgyptian river. He loved too, perhaps as warmly, though not so fatally\nas Katie did; but he spoke no word of his love. He walked among\nthe flowers with her, laughing and listening to her in his usual\nlight-hearted, easy manner; every now and again his arm would thrill\nwith pleasure, as he felt on it the touch of her little fingers, and his\nheart would leap within him as he gazed on the speaking beauty of her\nface; but he was too honest-hearted to talk to the young girl, to Mrs.\nWoodward's child, of love. He talked to her as to a child--but she\nlistened to him and loved him as a woman.\n\nAnd so they rambled on till the hour appointed for quitting this Elysium\nhad arrived. Every now and again they had a glimpse of some one of\ntheir party, which had satisfied Katie that they were not lost. At first\nClementina was seen tracing with her parasol on the turf the plan of\na new dance. Then Ugolina passed by them describing the poetry of the\nmotion of the spheres in a full flow of impassioned eloquence to M.\nDelabarbe de l'Empereur: '_C'est toujours vrai; ce que mademoiselle dit\nest toujours vrai_,' was the Frenchman's answer, which they heard thrice\nrepeated. And then Lactimel and Captain Val were seen together, the\nlatter having disappointed the prophecies which had been made respecting\nhim. Lactimel had an idea that as the Scotts were great people, they\nwere all in Parliament, and she was endeavouring to persuade Captain Val\nthat something ought to be done for the poor.\n\n'Think,' said she, 'only think, Captain Scott, of all the money that\nthis _f\u00c3\u00aate_ must cost.'\n\n'A doosed sight,' said the captain, hardly articulating from under his\nthick, sandy-coloured moustache, which, growing downwards from his\nnose, looked like a heavy thatch put on to protect his mouth from the\ninclemency of the clouds above. 'A doosed sight,' said the captain.\n\n'Now suppose, Captain Scott, that all this money could be collected. The\ntickets, you know, and the dresses, and----'\n\n'I wish I knew how to do it,' said the captain.\n\nLactimel went on with her little scheme for expending the cost of the\nflower-show in bread and bacon for the poor Irish of Saffron Hill; but\nCharley and Katie heard no more, for the mild philosopher passed out of\nhearing and out of sight.\n\nAt last Katie got a poke in her back from a parasol, just as Charley had\nexpended half a crown, one of Mr. M'Ruen's last, in purchasing for her\none simple beautiful flower, to put into her hair that night.\n\n'You naughty puss!' said Gertrude, 'we have been looking for you all\nover the gardens. Mrs. Val and the Miss Neverbends have been waiting\nthis half-hour.' Katie looked terribly frightened. 'Come along, and\ndon't keep them waiting any longer. They are all in the passage. This\nwas your fault, Master Charley.'\n\n'O no, it was not,' said Katie; 'but we thought----'\n\n'Never mind thinking,' said Gertrude, 'but come along.' And so they\nhurried on, and were soon replaced in their respective vehicles, and\nthen went back to town.\n\n'Well, I do think the Chiswick Gardens is the nicest place in all the\nworld,' said Katie, leaning back in the cab, and meditating on her past\nenjoyment.\n\n'They are very pretty--very,' said Lactimel Neverbend. 'I only wish\nevery cottar had such a garden behind his cottage. I am sure we might\nmanage it, if we set about it in the right way.'\n\n'What! as big as Chiswick?' said Katie.\n\n'No; not so big,' said Lactimel; 'but quite as nicely kept.'\n\n'I think the pigs would get in,' said Katie.\n\n'It would be much easier, and more important too, to keep their minds\nnicely,' said Ugolina; and there the pigs could never get in.'\n\n'No; I suppose not,' said Katie.\n\n'I don't know that,' said Lactimel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nKATIE'S FIRST BALL\n\n\nIn spite of Mrs. Val's oft-repeated assurance that they would have\nnone but nice people, she had done her best to fill her rooms, and not\nunsuccessfully. She had, it is true, eschewed the Golightly party, who\nresided some north of Oxford Street, in the purlieus of Fitzroy Square,\nand some even to the east of Tottenham Court Road. She had eschewed the\nGolightlys, and confined herself to the Scott connexion; but so great\nhad been her success in life, that, even under these circumstances, she\nhad found herself able to fill her rooms respectably. If, indeed,\nthere was no absolute crowding, if some space was left in the front\ndrawing-room sufficient for the operations of dancers, she could still\nattribute this apparent want of fashionable popularity to the selections\nof the few nice people whom she had asked. The Hon. Mrs. Val was no\nordinary woman, and understood well how to make the most of the goods\nwith which the gods provided her.\n\nThe Miss Neverbends were to dine with the Tudors, and go with them\nto the dance in the evening, and their brother Fidus was to meet them\nthere. Charley was, of course, one of the party at dinner; and as there\nwas no other gentleman there, Alaric had an excellent opportunity,\nwhen the ladies went up to their toilets, to impress on his cousin the\nexpediency of his losing no time in securing to himself Miss Golightly's\ntwenty thousand pounds. The conversation, as will be seen, at last\nbecame rather animated.\n\n'Well, Charley, what do you think of the beautiful Clementina?' said\nAlaric, pushing over the bottle to his cousin, as soon as they found\nthemselves alone. 'A 'doosed' fine girl, as Captain Val says, isn't\nshe?'\n\n'A 'doosed' fine girl, of course,' said Charley, laughing. 'She has too\nmuch go in her for me, I'm afraid.'\n\n'Marriage and children will soon pull that down. She'd make an excellent\nwife for such a man as you; and to tell you the truth, Charley, if\nyou'll take my advice, you'll lose no time in making up to her. She has\ngot that d---- French fellow at her heels, and though I don't suppose\nshe cares one straw about him, it may be well to make sure.'\n\n'But you don't mean in earnest that you think that Miss Golightly would\nhave me?'\n\n'Indeed I do--you are just the man to get on with girls; and, as far as\nI can see, you are just the man that will never get on in any other way\nunder the sun.'\n\nCharley sighed as he thought of his many debts, his poor prospects, and\nhis passionate love. There seemed, indeed, to be little chance that he\never would get on at all in the ordinary sense of the word. 'I'm sure\nshe'd refuse me,' said he, still wishing to back out of the difficulty.\n'I'm sure she would--I've not got a penny in the world, you know.'\n\n'That's just the reason--she has got lots of money, and you have got\nnone.'\n\n'Just the reason why she should refuse me, you should say.'\n\n'Well--what if she does? There's no harm done. 'Faint heart never won\nfair lady.' You've everything to back you--Mrs. Val is led by Undy\nScott, and Undy is all on your side.'\n\n'But she has got guardians, hasn't she?'\n\n'Yes--her father's first cousin, old Sam Golightly. He is dying; or dead\nprobably by this time; only Mrs. Val won't have the news brought to her,\nbecause of this party. He had a fit of apoplexy yesterday. Then there's\nher father's brother-in-law, Figgs; he's bedridden. When old Golightly\nis off the hooks altogether, another will be chosen, and Undy talks of\nputting in my name as that of a family friend; so you'll have everything\nto assist you.'\n\nCharley looked very grave. He had not been in the habit of discussing\nsuch matters, but it seemed to him, that if Alaric was about to become\nin any legal manner the guardian of Miss Golightly's fortune, that that\nin itself was reason enough why he, Alaric, should not propose such a\nmatch as this. Needy men, to be sure, did often marry rich ladies, and\nthe world looked on and regarded it only as a matter of course; but\nsurely it would be the duty of a guardian to protect his ward from such\na fate, if it were in his power to do so.\n\nAlaric, who saw something of what was going on in his cousin's mind,\nessayed to remove the impression which was thus made. 'Besides, you\nknow, Clementina is no chicken. Her fortune is at her own disposal. All\nthe guardians on earth cannot prevent her marrying you if she makes up\nher mind to do so.'\n\nCharley gulped down his glass of wine, and then sat staring at the fire,\nsaying nothing further. It was true enough that he was very poor--true\nenough that Miss Golightly's fortune would set him on his legs, and make\na man of him--true enough, perhaps, that no other expedient of which he\ncould think would do so. But then there were so many arguments that were\n'strong against the deed.' In the first place, he thought it impossible\nthat he should be successful in such a suit, and then again it would\nhardly be honest to obtain such success, if it were possible; then,\nthirdly, he had no sort of affection whatsoever for Miss Golightly; and\nfourthly, lastly, and chiefly, he loved so dearly, tenderly, loved poor\nKatie Woodward.\n\nAs he thought of this, he felt horror-stricken with himself at allowing\nthe idea of his becoming a suitor to another to dwell for an instant on\nhis mind, and looking up with all the resolution which he was able to\nsummon, he said--'It's impossible, Alaric, quite impossible! I couldn't\ndo it.'\n\n'Then what do you mean to do?' said Alaric, who was angry at having his\nscheme thus thwarted; 'do you mean to be a beggar?--or if not, how do\nyou intend to get out of your difficulties?'\n\n'I trust not a beggar,' said Charley, sadly.\n\n'What other hope have you? what rational hope of setting yourself\nright?'\n\n'Perhaps I may do something by writing,' said Charley, very bashfully.\n\n'By writing! ha, ha, ha,' and Alaric laughed somewhat cruelly at the\npoor navvy--' do something by writing! what will you do by writing? will\nyou make \u00c2\u00a320,000--or 20,000 pence? Of all trades going, that, I should\nsay, is likely to be the poorest for a poor man--the poorest and the\nmost heart-breaking. What have you made already to encourage you?'\n\n'The editor says that 'Crinoline and Macassar' will come to \u00c2\u00a34 10s.'\n\n'And when will you get it?'\n\n'The editor says that the rule is to pay six months after the date of\npublication. The _Daily Delight_ is only a new thing, you know. The\neditor says that, if the sale comes up to his expectations, he will\nincrease the scale of pay.'\n\n'A prospect of \u00c2\u00a34 10s. for a fortnight's hard work! That's a bad\nlook-out, my boy; you had better take the heiress.'\n\n'It may be a bad look-out,' said Charley, whose spirit was raised by his\ncousin's sneers--'but at any rate it's honest. And I'll tell you what,\nAlaric, I'd sooner earn \u00c2\u00a350 by writing for the press, than get \u00c2\u00a31,000 in\nany other way you can think of. It may be a poor trade in one way; and\nauthors, I believe, are poor; but I am sure it has its consolations.'\n\n'Well, Charley, I hope with all my heart that you may find them. For my\nown part, seeing what a place the world is, seeing what are the general\naspirations of other men, seeing what, as it appears to me, the Creator\nhas intended for the goal of our labours, I look for advancement,\nprosperity, and such rank and station as I may be able to win for\nmyself. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and I do not mean to refuse\nsuch wages as may come in my way.'\n\n'Yes,' said Charley, who, now that his spirit was roused, determined to\nfight his battle manfully, 'yes, the labourer is worthy of his hire;\nbut were I to get Miss Golightly's fortune I should be taking the hire\nwithout labour.'\n\n'Bah!' said Alaric.\n\n'It would be dishonest in every way, for I do not love her, and should\nnot love her at the moment that I married her.'\n\n'Honesty!' said Alaric, still sneering; 'there is no sign of the\ndishonesty of the age so strong as the continual talk which one hears\nabout honesty!' It was quite manifest that Alaric had not sat at the\nfeet of Undy Scott without profiting by the lessons which he had heard.\n\n'With what face,' continued he, 'can you pretend to be more honest than\nyour neighbours?'\n\n'I know that it is wrong, and unmanly too, to hunt a girl down merely\nfor what she has got.'\n\n'There are a great many wrong and unmanly men about, then,' said Alaric.\n'Look through the Houses of Parliament, and see how many men there have\nmarried for money; aye, and made excellent husbands afterwards. I'll\ntell you what it is, Charley, it is all humbug in you to pretend to be\nbetter than others; you are not a bit better;--mind, I do not say you\nare worse. We have none of us too much of this honesty of which we are\nso fond of prating. Where was your honesty when you ordered the coat for\nwhich you know you cannot pay? or when you swore to the bootmaker that\nhe should have the amount of his little bill after next quarter-day,\nknowing in your heart at the time that he wouldn't get a farthing of it?\nIf you are so honest, why did you waste your money to-day in going to\nChiswick, instead of paying some portion of your debts? Honest! you are,\nI dare say, indifferently honest as the world goes, like the rest of\nus. But I think you might put the burden of Clementina's fortune on your\nconscience without feeling much the worse for it after what you have\nalready gone through.'\n\nCharley became very red in the face as he sat silent, listening to\nAlaric's address--nor did he speak at once at the first pause, so Alaric\nwent on. 'The truth, I take it, is, that at the present moment you have\nno personal fancy for this girl.'\n\n'No, I have not,' said Charley.\n\n'And you are so incredibly careless as to all prudential considerations\nas to prefer your immediate personal fancies to the future welfare\nof your whole life. I can say no more. If you will think well of my\nproposition, I will do all I can to assist you. I have no doubt you\nwould make a good husband to Miss Golightly, and that she would be very\nhappy with you. If you think otherwise there is an end of it; but pray\ndo not talk so much about your honesty--your tailor would arrest you\nto-morrow if he heard you.'\n\n'There are two kinds of honesty, I take it,' said Charley, speaking with\nsuppressed anger and sorrow visible in his face, 'that which the world\nsees and that which it does not see. For myself, I have nothing to say\nin my own defence. I have made my bed badly, and must lie on it as it\nis. I certainly will not mend it by marrying a girl that I can never\nlove. And as for you, Alaric, all who know you and love you watch your\ncareer with the greatest hope. We know your ambition, and all look to\nsee you rise in the world. But in rising, as you will do, you should\nremember this--that nothing that is wrong can become right because other\npeople do it.'\n\n'Well, Charley,' said the other, 'thank you for the lecture. I did not\ncertainly expect it from you; but it is not on that account the less\nwelcome. And now, suppose we go upstairs and dress for Mrs. Val;' and so\nthey went upstairs.\n\nKatie's heart beat high as she got out of the carriage--Mrs. Val's\nprivate carriage had been kept on for the occasion--and saw before and\nabove her on the stairs a crowd of muslin crushing its way on towards\nthe room prepared for dancing. Katie had never been to a ball before. We\nhope that the word ball may not bring down on us the adverse criticism\nof the _Morning Post_. It was probably not a ball in the strictly\nfashionable sense of the word, but it was so to Katie to all intents\nand purposes. Her dancing had hitherto been done either at children's\nparties, or as a sort of supplemental amusement to the evening\ntea-gatherings at Hampton or Hampton Court. She had never yet seen the\nmuse worshipped with the premeditated ceremony of banished carpets,\nchalked floors, and hired musicians. Her heart consequently beat high as\nshe made her way upstairs, linked arm-in-arm with Ugolina Neverbend.\n\n'Shall you dance much?' said Ugolina.\n\n'Oh, I hope so,' said Katie.\n\n'I shall not. It is an amusement of which I am peculiarly fond, and\nfor which my active habits suit me.' This was probably said with some\nallusion to her sister, who was apt to be short of breath. 'But in the\ndances of the present day conversation is impossible, and I look upon\nany pursuit as barbaric which stops the \"feast of reason and the flow of\nsoul.\"'\n\nKatie did not quite understand this, but she thought in her heart that\nshe would not at all mind giving up talking for the whole evening if she\ncould only get dancing enough. But on this matter her heart misgave\nher. To be sure, she was engaged to Charley for the first quadrille and\nsecond waltz; but there her engagements stopped, whereas Clementina, as\nshe was aware, had a whole book full of them. What if she should get no\nmore dancing when Charley's good nature should have been expended? She\nhad an idea that no one would care to dance with her when older partners\nwere to be had. Ah, Katie, you do not yet know the extent of your\nriches, or half the wealth of your own attractions!\n\nAnd then they all heard another little speech from Mrs. Val. 'She was\nreally quite ashamed--she really was--to see so many people; she could\nnot wish any of her guests away, that would be impossible--though\nperhaps one or two might be spared,' she said in a confidential whisper\nto Gertrude. Who the one or two might be it would be difficult to\ndecide, as she had made the same whisper to every one; 'but she really\nwas ashamed; there was almost a crowd, and she had quite intended that\nthe house should be nearly empty. The fact was, everybody asked had\ncome, and as she could not, of course, have counted on that, why, she\nhad got, you see, twice as many people as she had expected.' And then\nshe went on, and made the same speech to the next arrival.\n\nKatie, who wanted to begin the play at the beginning, kept her eye\nanxiously on Charley, who was still standing with Lactimel Neverbend\non his arm. 'Oh, now,' said she to herself, 'if he should forget me and\nbegin dancing with Miss Neverbend!' But then she remembered how he had\njumped into the water, and determined that, even with such provocation\nas that, she must not be angry with him.\n\nBut there was no danger of Charley's forgetting. 'Come,' said he, 'we\nmust not lose any more time, if we mean to dance the first set. Alaric\nwill be our _vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis_--he is going to dance with Miss Neverbend,' and\nso they stood up. Katie tightened her gloves, gave her dress a little\nshake, looked at her shoes, and then the work of the evening began.\n\n'I shouldn't have liked to have sat down for the first dance,' she said\nconfidentially to Charley, 'because it's my first ball.'\n\n'Sit down! I don't suppose you'll be let to sit down the whole evening.\nYou'll be crying out for mercy about three or four o'clock in the\nmorning.'\n\n'It's you to go on now,' said Katie, whose eyes were intent on the\nfigure, and who would not have gone wrong herself, or allowed her\npartner to do so, on any consideration. And so the dance went on right\nmerrily.\n\n'I've got to dance the first polka with Miss Golightly,' said Charley.\n\n'And the next with me,' said Katie.\n\n'You may be sure I shan't forget that.'\n\n'You lucky man to get Miss Golightly for a partner. I am told she is the\nmost beautiful dancer in the world.'\n\n'O no--Mademoiselle ---- is much better,' said Charley, naming the\nprincipal stage performer of the day. 'If one is to go the whole hog,\none had better do it thoroughly.'\n\nKatie did not quite understand then what he meant, and merely replied\nthat she would look at the performance. In this, however, she was\ndestined to be disappointed, for Charley had hardly left her before Miss\nGolightly brought up to her the identical M. Delabarbe de l'Empereur who\nhad so terribly put her out in the gardens. This was done so suddenly,\nthat Katie's presence of mind was quite insufficient to provide her\nwith any means of escape. The Frenchman bowed very low and said nothing.\nKatie made a little curtsy, and was equally silent. Then she felt her\nown arm gathered up and put within his, and she stood up to take her\nshare in the awful performance. She felt herself to be in such a nervous\nfright that she would willingly have been home again at Hampton if\nshe could; but as this was utterly impossible, she had only to bethink\nherself of her steps, and get through the work as best she might.\n\nAway went Charley and Clementina leading the throng; away went M.\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe and Linda; away went another Frenchman, clasping in his\narms the happy Ugolina. Away went Lactimel with a young Weights and\nMeasures--and then came Katie's turn. She pressed her lips together,\nshut her eyes, and felt the tall Frenchman's arms behind her back, and\nmade a start. 'Twas like plunging into cold water on the first bathing\nday of the season--'_ce n'est que le premier pas que coute._' When once\noff Katie did not find it so bad. The Frenchman danced well, and Katie\nherself was a wicked little adept. At home, at Surbiton, dancing with\nanother girl, she had with great triumph tired out the fingers both of\nher mother and sister, and forced them to own that it was impossible to\nput her down. M. de l'Empereur, therefore, had his work before him, and\nhe did it like a man--as long as he could.\n\nKatie, who had not yet assumed the airs or will of a grown-up young\nlady, thought that she was bound to go on as long as her grand partner\nchose to go with her. He, on the other hand, accustomed in his gallantry\nto obey all ladies' wishes, considered himself bound to leave it to\nher to stop when she pleased. And so they went on with apparently\ninterminable gyrations. Charley and the heiress had twice been in\nmotion, and had twice stopped, and still they were going on; Ugolina\nhad refreshed herself with many delicious observations, and Lactimel had\nthrice paused to advocate dancing for the million, and still they went\non; the circle was gradually left to themselves, and still they went\non; people stood round, some admiring and others pitying; and still they\nwent on. Katie, thinking of her steps and her business, did not perceive\nthat she and her partner were alone; and ever and anon, others of course\njoined in--and so they went on--and on--and on.\n\nM. Delabarbe de l'Empereur was a strong and active man, but he began to\nperceive that the lady was too much for him. He was already melting away\nwith his exertions, while his partner was as cool as a cucumber. She,\nwith her active young legs, her lightly filled veins, and small agile\nframe, could have gone on almost for ever; but M. de l'Empereur was more\nencumbered. Gallantry was at last beat by nature, his overtasked muscles\nwould do no more for him, and he was fain to stop, dropping his partner\ninto a chair, and throwing himself in a state of utter exhaustion\nagainst the wall.\n\nKatie was hardly out of breath as she received the congratulations of\nher friends; but at the moment she could not understand why they were\nquizzing her. In after times, however, she was often reproached with\nhaving danced a Frenchman to death in the evening, in revenge for his\nhaving bored her in the morning. It was observed that M. Delabarbe de\nl'Empereur danced no more that evening. Indeed, he very soon left the\nhouse.\n\nKatie had not been able to see Miss Golightly's performance, but it had\nbeen well worth seeing. She was certainly no ordinary performer, and if\nshe did not quite come up to the remarkable movements which one sees on\nthe stage under the name of dancing, the fault was neither in her will\nnor her ability, but only in her education. Charley also was peculiarly\nwell suited to give her 'ample verge and room enough' to show off all\nher perfections. Her most peculiar merit consisted, perhaps, in her\npower of stopping herself suddenly, while going on at the rate of a hunt\none way, and without any pause or apparent difficulty going just as fast\nthe other way. This was done by a jerk which must, one would be inclined\nto think, have dislocated all her bones and entirely upset her internal\narrangements. But no; it was done without injury, or any disagreeable\nresult either to her brain or elsewhere. We all know how a steamer is\nmanoeuvred when she has to change her course, how we stop her and ease\nher and back her; but Miss Golightly stopped and eased and backed all at\nonce, and that without collision with any other craft. It was truly very\nwonderful, and Katie ought to have looked at her.\n\nKatie soon found occasion to cast off her fear that her evening's\nhappiness would be destroyed by a dearth of partners. Her troubles began\nto be of an exactly opposite description. She had almost envied Miss\nGolightly her little book full of engagements, and now she found herself\ndreadfully bewildered by a book of her own. Some one had given her a\ncard and a pencil, and every moment she could get to herself was taken\nup in endeavouring to guard herself from perfidy on her own part. All\ndown the card, at intervals which were not very far apart, there were\ngreat C's, which stood for Charley, and her firmest feeling was that\nno earthly consideration should be allowed to interfere with those\nlandmarks. And then there were all manner of hieroglyphics--sometimes,\nunfortunately, illegible to Katie herself--French names and English\nnames mixed together in a manner most vexatious; and to make matters\nworse, she found that she had put down both Victoire Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe and Mr.\nJohnson of the Weights, by a great I, and she could not remember with\nwhom she was bound to dance the lancers, and to which she had promised\nthe last polka before supper. One thing, however, was quite fixed: when\nsupper should arrive she was to go downstairs with Charley.\n\n'What dreadful news, Linda!' said Charley; 'did you hear it?' Linda was\nstanding up with Mr. Neverbend for a sober quadrille, and Katie also was\nclose by with her partner. 'Dreadful news indeed!'\n\n'What is it?' said Linda.\n\n'A man can die but once, to be sure; but to be killed in such a manner\nas that, is certainly very sad.'\n\n'Killed! who has been killed?' said Neverbend.\n\n'Well, perhaps I shouldn't say killed. He only died in the cab as he\nwent home.'\n\n'Died in a cab! how dreadful!' said Neverbend. 'Who? who was it, Mr.\nTudor?'\n\n'Didn't you hear? How very odd! Why M. de l'Empereur, to be sure. I\nwonder what the coroner will bring it in.'\n\n'How can you talk such nonsense, Charley?' said Linda.\n\n'Very well, Master Charley,' said Katie. 'All that comes of being a\nwriter of romances. I suppose that's to be the next contribution to the\n_Daily Delight_.'\n\nNeverbend went off on his quadrille not at all pleased with the joke.\nIndeed, he was never pleased with a joke, and in this instance he\nventured to suggest to his partner that the idea of a gentleman expiring\nin a cab was much too horrid to be laughed at.\n\n'Oh, we never mind Charley Tudor,' said Linda; 'he always goes on in\nthat way. We all like him so much.'\n\nMr. Neverbend, who, though not very young, still had a susceptible heart\nwithin his bosom, had been much taken by Linda's charms. He already\nbegan to entertain an idea that as a Mrs. Neverbend would be a desirable\nadjunct to his establishment at some future period, he could not do\nbetter than offer himself and his worldly goods to the acceptance of\nMiss Woodward; he therefore said nothing further in disparagement of the\nfamily friend; but he resolved that no such alliance should ever induce\nhim to make Mr. Charles Tudor welcome at his house. But what could he\nhave expected? The Internal Navigation had ever been a low place, and\nhe was surprised that the Hon. Mrs. Val should have admitted one of the\nnavvies inside her drawing-room.\n\nAnd so the ball went on. Mr. Johnson came duly for the lancers, and M.\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe for the polka. Johnson was great at the lancers, knowing\nevery turn and vagary in that most intricate and exclusive of dances;\nand it need hardly be said that the polka with M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe was\nsuccessful. The last honour, however, was not without evil results, for\nit excited the envy of Ugolina, who, proud of her own performance,\nhad longed, but hitherto in vain, to be whirled round the room by that\nwondrously expert foreigner.\n\n'Well, my dear,' said Ugolina, with an air that plainly said that Katie\nwas to be treated as a child, 'I hope you have had dancing enough.'\n\n'Oh, indeed I have not,' said Katie, fully appreciating the purport and\ncause of her companion's remark; 'not near enough.'\n\n'Ah--but, my dear--you should remember,' said Ugolina; 'your mamma will\nbe displeased if you fatigue yourself.'\n\n'My mamma is never displeased because we amuse ourselves, and I am not a\nbit fatigued;' and so saying Katie walked off, and took refuge with her\nsister Gertrude. What business had any Ugolina Neverbend to interfere\nbetween her and her mamma?\n\nThen came the supper. There was a great rush to get downstairs, but\nCharley was so clever that even this did not put him out. Of course\nthere was no sitting down; which means that the bashful, retiring,\nand obedient guests were to stand on their legs; while those who were\nforward, and impudent, and disobedient, found seats for themselves\nwherever they could. Charley was certainly among the latter class, and\nhe did not rest therefore till he had got Katie into an old arm-chair in\none corner of the room, in such a position as to enable himself to eat\nhis own supper leaning against the chimney-piece.\n\n'I say, Johnson,' said he, 'do bring me some ham and chicken--it's for a\nlady--I'm wedged up here and can't get out--and, Johnson, some sherry.'\n\nThe good-natured young Weights obeyed, and brought the desired\nprovisions.\n\n'And Johnson--upon my word I'm sorry to be so troublesome--but one more\nplateful if you please--for another lady--a good deal, if you please,\nfor this lady, for she's very hungry; and some more sherry.'\n\nJohnson again obeyed--the Weights are always obedient--and Charley of\ncourse appropriated the second portion to his own purposes.\n\n'Oh, Charley, that was a fib--now wasn't it? You shouldn't have said it\nwas for a lady.'\n\n'But then I shouldn't have got it.'\n\n'Oh, but that's no reason; according to that everybody might tell a fib\nwhenever they wanted anything.'\n\n'Well, everybody does--everybody except you, Katie.'\n\n'O no,' said Katie--'no they don't--mamma, and Linda, and Gertrude never\ndo; nor Harry Norman, he never does, nor Alaric.'\n\n'No, Harry Norman never does,' said Charley, with something like\nvexation in his tone. He made no exception to Katie's list of\ntruth-tellers, but he was thinking within himself whether Alaric had a\njuster right to be in the catalogue than himself. 'Harry Norman never\ndoes, certainly. You must not compare me with them, Katie. They are\npatterns of excellence. I am all the other way, as everybody knows.' He\nwas half laughing as he spoke, but Katie's sharp ear knew that he was\nmore than half in earnest, and she felt she had pained him by what she\nhad said.\n\n'Oh, Charley, I didn't mean that; indeed I did not. I know that in all\nserious things you are as truthful as they are--and quite as good--that\nis, in many ways.' Poor Katie! she wanted to console him, she wanted to\nbe kind, and yet she could not be dishonest.\n\n'Quite as good! no, you know I am not.'\n\n'You are as good-hearted, if not better; and you will be as steady,\nwon't you, Charley? I am sure you will; and I know you are more clever,\nreally more clever than either of them.'\n\n'Oh! Katie.'\n\n'I am quite sure you are. I have always said so; don't be angry with me\nfor what I said.'\n\n'Angry with you! I couldn't be angry with you.'\n\n'I wouldn't, for the world, say anything to vex you. I like you better\nthan either of them, though Alaric is my brother-in-law. Of course I do;\nhow could I help it, when you saved my life?'\n\n'Saved your life! Pooh! I didn't save your life. Any boy could have done\nthe same, or any waterman about the place. When you fell in, the person\nwho was nearest you pulled you out, that was all.'\n\nThere was something almost approaching to ferocity in his voice as he\nsaid this; and yet when Katie timidly looked up she saw that he had\nturned his back to the room, and that his eyes were full of tears. He\nhad felt that he was loved by this child, but that he was loved from a\nfeeling of uncalled-for gratitude. He could not stop to analyse this,\nto separate the sweet from the bitter; but he knew that the latter\nprevailed. It is so little flattering to be loved when such love is the\noffspring of gratitude. And then when that gratitude is unnecessary,\nwhen it has been given in mistake for supposed favours, the acceptance\nof such love is little better than a cheat!\n\n'That was not all,' said Katie, very decidedly. 'It never shall be all\nin my mind. If you had not been with us I should now have been drowned,\nand cold, and dead; and mamma! where would she have been? Oh! Charley, I\nshall think myself so wicked if I have said anything to vex you.'\n\nCharley did not analyse his feelings, nor did Katie analyse hers. It\nwould have been impossible for her to do so. But could she have done it,\nand had she done it, she would have found that her gratitude was but the\nexcuse which she made to herself for a passionate love which she could\nnot have excused, even to herself, in any other way.\n\nHe said everything he could to reassure her and make her happy, and she\nsoon smiled and laughed again.\n\n'Now, that's what my editor would call a Nemesis,' said Charley.\n\n'Oh, that's a Nemesis, is it?'\n\n'Johnson was cheated into doing my work, and getting me my supper; and\nthen you scolded me, and took away my appetite, so that I couldn't eat\nit; that's a Nemesis. Johnson is avenged, only, unluckily, he doesn't\nknow it, and wickedness is punished.'\n\n'Well, mind you put it into the _Daily Delight_. But all the girls are\ngoing upstairs; pray let me get out,' and so Katie went upstairs again.\n\nIt was then past one. About two hours afterwards, Gertrude, looking for\nher sister that she might take her home, found her seated on a bench,\nwith her feet tucked under her dress. She was very much fatigued, and\nshe looked to be so; but there was still a bright laughing sparkle in\nher eye, which showed that her spirits were not even yet weary.\n\n'Well, Katie, have you had enough dancing?'\n\n'Nearly,' said Katie, yawning.\n\n'You look as if you couldn't stand.'\n\n'Yes, I am too tired to stand; but still I think I could dance a little\nmore, only--'\n\n'Only what?'\n\n'Whisper,' said Katie; and Gertrude put down her ear near to her\nsister's lips. 'Both my shoes are quite worn out, and my toes are all\nout on the floor.'\n\nIt was clearly time for them to go home, so away they all went.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nEXCELSIOR\n\n\nThe last words that Katie spoke as she walked down Mrs. Val's hall,\nleaning on Charley's arm, as he led her to the carriage, were these--\n\n'You will be steady, Charley, won't you? you will try to be steady,\nwon't you, dear Charley?' and as she spoke she almost imperceptibly\nsqueezed the arm on which she was leaning. Charley pressed her little\nhand as he parted from her, but he said nothing. What could he say, in\nthat moment of time, in answer to such a request? Had he made the reply\nwhich would have come most readily to his lips, it would have been this:\n'It is too late, Katie--too late for me to profit by a caution, even\nfrom you--no steadiness now will save me.' Katie, however, wanted no\nother answer than the warm pressure which she felt on her hand.\n\nAnd then, leaning back in the carriage, and shutting her eyes, she\ntried to think quietly over the events of the night. But it was, alas! a\ndream, and yet so like reality that she could not divest herself of the\nfeeling that the ball was still going on. She still seemed to see the\nlights and hear the music, to feel herself whirled round the room, and\nto see others whirling, whirling, whirling on every side of her. She\nthought over all the names on her card, and the little contests that\nhad taken place for her hand, and all Charley's jokes, and M. de\nl'Empereur's great disaster; and then as she remembered how long she had\ngone on twisting round with the poor unfortunate ill-used Frenchman, she\ninvoluntarily burst out into a fit of laughter.\n\n'Good gracious, Katie, what is the matter? I thought you were asleep,'\nsaid Gertrude.\n\n'So did I,' said Linda. 'What on earth can you be laughing at now?'\n\n'I was laughing at myself,' said Katie, still going on with her\nhalf-suppressed chuckle, 'and thinking what a fool I was to go on\ndancing so long with that M. de l'Empereur. Oh dear, Gertrude, I am so\ntired: shall we be home soon?' and then she burst out crying.\n\nThe excitement and fatigue of the day had been too much for her, and\nshe was now completely overcome. Ugolina Neverbend's advice, though not\nquite given in the kindest way, had in itself been good. Mrs. Woodward\nwould, in truth, have been unhappy could she have seen her child at this\nmoment. Katie made an attempt to laugh off her tears, but she failed,\nand her sobs then became hysterical, and she lay with her head on her\nmarried sister's shoulder, almost choking herself in her attempts to\nrepress them.\n\n'Dear Katie, don't sob so,' said Linda--'don't cry, pray don't cry, dear\nKatie.'\n\n'She had better let it have its way,' said Gertrude; 'she will be better\ndirectly, won't you, Katie?'\n\nIn a little time she was better, and then she burst out laughing again.\n'I wonder why the man went on when he was so tired. What a stupid man he\nmust be!'\n\nGertrude and Linda both laughed in order to comfort her and bring her\nround.\n\n'Do you know, I think it was because he didn't know how to say 'stop' in\nEnglish;' and then she burst out laughing again, and that led to another\nfit of hysterical tears.\n\nWhen they reached home Gertrude and Linda soon got her into bed. Linda\nwas to sleep with her, and she also was not very long in laying her head\non her pillow. But before she did so Katie was fast asleep, and twice in\nher sleep she cried out, 'Oh, Charley! Oh, Charley!' Then Linda guessed\nhow it was with her sister, and in the depths of her loving heart she\nsorrowed for the coming grief which she foresaw.\n\nWhen the morning came Katie was feverish, and had a headache. It was\nthought better that she should remain in town, and Alaric took Linda\ndown to Hampton. The next day Mrs. Woodward came up, and as the invalid\nwas better she took her home. But still she was an invalid. The doctor\ndeclared that she had never quite recovered from her fall into the\nriver, and prescribed quiet and cod-liver oil. All the truth about the\nChiswick f\u00c3\u00aate and the five hours' dancing, and the worn-out shoes, was\nnot told to him, or he might, perhaps, have acquitted the water-gods of\nthe injury. Nor was it all, perhaps, told to Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'I'm afraid she tired herself at the ball,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'I think she did a little,' said Linda.\n\n'Did she dance much?' said Mrs. Woodward, looking anxiously.\n\n'She did dance a good deal,' said Linda.\n\nMrs. Woodward was too wise to ask any further questions.\n\nAs it was a fine night Alaric had declared his intention of walking home\nfrom Mrs. Val's party, and he and Charley started together. They soon\nparted on their roads, but not before Alaric had had time to notice\nCharley's perverse stupidity as to Miss Golightly.\n\n'So you wouldn't take my advice about Clementina?' said he.\n\n'It was quite impossible, Alaric,' said Charley, in an apologetic voice.\n'I couldn't do it, and, what is more, I am sure I never shall.'\n\n'No, not now; you certainly can't do it now. If I am not very much\nmistaken, the chance is gone. I think you'll find she engaged herself to\nthat Frenchman to-night.'\n\n'Very likely,' said Charley.\n\n'Well--I did the best I could for you. Good night, old fellow.'\n\n'I'm sure I'm much obliged to you. Good night,' said Charley.\n\nAlaric's suggestion with reference to the heiress was quite correct: M.\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe had that night proposed, and been duly accepted. He was to\npresent himself to his loved one's honourable mother on the following\nmorning as her future son-in-law, comforted and supported in his task of\ndoing so by an assurance from the lady that if her mother would not\ngive her consent the marriage should go on all the same without it. How\ndelightful to have such a dancer for her lover! thought Clementina. That\nwas her 'Excelsior.'\n\nCharley walked home with a sad heart. He had that day given a pledge\nthat he would on the morrow go to the 'Cat and Whistle,' and visit his\nlady-love. Since the night when he sat there with Norah Geraghty on his\nknee, now nearly a fortnight since, he had spent but little of his\ntime there. He had, indeed, gone there once or twice with his friend\nScatterall, but had contrived to avoid any confidential intercourse\nwith either the landlady or the barmaid, alleging, as an excuse for his\nextra-ordinary absence, that his time was wholly occupied by the demands\nmade on it by the editor of the _Daily Delight_. Mrs. Davis, however,\nwas much too sharp, and so also we may say was Miss Geraghty, to be\ndeceived. They well knew that such a young man as Charley would go\nwherever his inclination led him. Till lately it had been all but\nimpossible to get him out of the little back parlour at the 'Cat and\nWhistle'; now it was nearly as difficult to get him into it. They both\nunderstood what this meant.\n\n'You'd better take up with Peppermint and have done with it,' said the\nwidow. 'What's the good of your shilly-shallying till you're as thin as\na whipping-post? If you don't mind what you're after he'll be off too.'\n\n'And the d---- go along with him,' said Miss Geraghty, who had still\nabout her a twang of the County Clare, from whence she came.\n\n'With all my heart,' said Mrs. Davis; 'I shall save my hundred pounds:\nbut if you'll be led by me you'll not throw Peppermint over till you're\nsure of the other; and, take my word for it, you're----'\n\n'I hate Peppermint.'\n\n'Nonsense; he's an honest good sort of man, and a deal more likely to\nkeep you out of want than the other.'\n\nHereupon Norah began to cry, and to wipe her beautiful eyes with the\nglass-cloth. Hers, indeed, was a cruel position. Her face was her\nfortune, and her fortune she knew was deteriorating from day to day. She\ncould not afford to lose the lover that she loved, and also the lover\nthat she did not love. Matrimony with her was extremely desirable, and\nshe was driven to confess that it might very probably be either now or\nnever. Much as she hated Peppermint, she was quite aware that she would\ntake him if she could not do better. But then, was it absolutely certain\nthat she must lose the lover that so completely suited her taste? Mrs.\nDavis said it was. Norah herself, confiding, as it is so natural that\nladies should do, a little too much in her own beauty, thought that she\ncouldn't but have a chance left. She also had her high aspirations; she\ndesired to rise in the world, to leave goes of gin and screws of tobacco\nbehind her, and to reach some position more worthy of the tastes of a\nwoman. 'Excelsior,' translated doubtless into excellent Irish, was\nher motto also. It would be so great a thing to be the wife of Charles\nTudor, Esq., of the Civil Service, and more especially as she dearly and\ntruly loved the same Charles Tudor in her heart of hearts.\n\nShe knew, however, that it was not for her to indulge in the luxury of\na heart, if circumstances absolutely forbade it. To eat and drink and\nclothe herself, and, if possible, to provide eating and drinking and\nclothes for her future years, this was the business of life, this was\nthe only real necessity. She had nothing to say in opposition to Mrs.\nDavis, and therefore she went on crying, and again wiped her eyes with\nthe glass-cloth.\n\nMrs. Davis, however, was no stern monitor, unindulgent to the weakness\nof human nature. When she saw how Norah took to heart her sad fate, she\nresolved to make one more effort in her favour. She consequently dressed\nherself very nicely, put on her best bonnet, and took the unprecedented\nstep of going off to the Internal Navigation, and calling on Charley in\nthe middle of his office.\n\nCharley was poking over the Kennett and Avon lock entries, with his\nusual official energy, when the office messenger came up and informed\nhim that a lady was waiting to see him.\n\n'A lady!' said Charley: 'what lady?' and he immediately began thinking\nof the Woodwards, whom he was to meet that afternoon at Chiswick.\n\n'I'm sure I can't say, sir: all that she said was that she was a lady,'\nanswered the messenger, falsely, for he well knew that the woman was\nMrs. Davis, of the 'Cat and Whistle.'\n\nNow the clerks at the Internal Navigation were badly off for a\nwaiting-room; and in no respect can the different ranks of different\npublic offices be more plainly seen than in the presence or absence of\nsuch little items of accommodation as this. At the Weights and\nMeasures there was an elegant little chamber, carpeted, furnished\nwith leathern-bottomed chairs, and a clock, supplied with cream-laid\nnote-paper, new pens, and the _Times_ newspaper, quite a little Elysium,\nin which to pass half an hour, while the Secretary, whom one had called\nto see, was completing his last calculation on the matter of the decimal\ncoinage. But there were no such comforts at the Internal Navigation.\nThere was, indeed, a little room at the top of the stairs, in which\nvisitors were requested to sit down; but even here two men were always\nat work--at work, or else at play.\n\nInto this room Mrs. Davis was shown, and there Charley found her. Long\nand intimately as the young navvy had been acquainted with the landlady\nof the 'Cat and Whistle,' he had never before seen her arrayed for the\nouter world. It may be doubted whether Sir John Falstaff would, at the\nfirst glance, have known even Dame Quickly in her bonnet, that is, if\nDame Quickly in those days had had a bonnet. At any rate Charley was at\nfault for a moment, and was shaking hands with the landlady before he\nquite recognized who she was.\n\nThe men in the room, however, had recognized her, and Charley well knew\nthat they had done so.\n\n'Mr. Tudor,' she began, not a bit abashed, 'I want to know what it is\nyou are a-going to do?'\n\nThough she was not abashed, Charley was, and very much so. However,\nhe contrived to get her out of the room, so that he might speak to her\nsomewhat more privately in the passage. The gentlemen at the Internal\nNavigation were well accustomed to this mode of colloquy, as their\ntradesmen not unfrequently called, with the view of having a little\nconversation, which could not conveniently be held in the public room.\n\n'And, Mr. Tudor, what are you a-going to do about that poor girl there?'\nsaid Mrs. Davis, as soon as she found herself in the passage, and saw\nthat Charley was comfortably settled with his back against the wall.\n\n'She may go to Hong-Kong for me.' That is what Charley should have said.\nBut he did not say it. He had neither the sternness of heart nor the\nmoral courage to enable him to do so. He was very anxious, it is true,\nto get altogether quit of Norah Geraghty; but his present immediate care\nwas confined to a desire of getting Mrs. Davis out of the office.\n\n'Do!' said Charley. 'Oh, I don't know; I'll come and settle something\nsome of these days; let me see when--say next Tuesday.'\n\n'Settle something,' said Mrs. Davis. 'If you are an honest man, as I\ntake you, there is only one thing to settle; when do you mean to marry\nher?'\n\n'Hush!' said Charley; for, as she was speaking, Mr. Snape came down\nthe passage leading from Mr. Oldeschole's room. 'Hush!' Mr. Snape as he\npassed walked very slowly, and looked curiously round into the widow's\nface. 'I'll be even with you, old fellow, for that,' said Charley to\nhimself; and it may be taken for granted that he kept his word before\nlong.\n\n'Oh! it is no good hushing any more,' said Mrs. Davis, hardly waiting\ntill Mr. Snape's erect ears were out of hearing. 'Hushing won't do no\ngood; there's that girl a-dying, and her grave'll be a-top of your head,\nMr. Tudor; mind I tell you that fairly; so now I want to know what it to\nyou're a-going to do.' And then Mrs. Davis lifted up the lid of a market\nbasket which hung on her left arm, took out her pocket-handkerchief, and\nbegan to wipe her eyes.\n\nUnfortunate Charley! An idea occurred to him that he might bolt and\nleave her. But then the chances were that she would make her way into\nhis very room, and tell her story there, out before them all. He well\nknew that this woman was capable of many things if her temper were\nfairly roused. And yet what could he say to her to induce her to go out\nfrom that building, and leave him alone to his lesser misfortunes?\n\n'She's a-dying, I tell you, Mr. Tudor,' continued the landlady, 'and if\nshe do die, be sure of this, I won't be slow to tell the truth about it.\nI'm the only friend she's got, and I'm not going to see her put upon.\nSo just tell me this in two words--what is it you're a-going to do?' And\nthen Mrs. Davis replaced her kerchief in the basket, stood boldly erect\nin the middle of the passage, waiting for Charley's answer.\n\nJust at this moment Mr. Snape again appeared in the passage, going\ntowards Mr. Oldeschole's room. The pernicious old man! He hated Charley\nTudor; and, to tell the truth, there was no love lost between them.\nCharley, afflicted and out of spirits as he was at the moment, could not\nresist the opportunity of being impertinent to his old foe: 'I'm afraid\nyou'll make yourself very tired, Mr. Snape, if you walk about so much,'\nsaid he. Mr. Snape merely looked at him, and then hard at Mrs. Davis,\nand passed on to Mr. Oldeschole's room.\n\n'Well, Mr. Tudor, will you be so good as to tell me what it is you're\ngoing to do about this poor girl?'\n\n'My goodness, Mrs. Davis, you know how I am situated--how can you expect\nme to give an answer to such a question in such a place as this? I'll\ncome to the 'Cat and Whistle' on Tuesday.'\n\n'Gammon!' said the eloquent lady. 'You know you means gammon.'\n\nCharley, perhaps, did mean gammon; but he protested that he had never\nbeen more truthfully in earnest in his life. Mr. Oldeschole's door\nopened, and Mrs. Davis perceiving it, whipped out her handkerchief\nin haste, and again began wiping her eyes, not without audible sobs.\n'Confound the woman!' said Charley to himself; 'what on earth shall I do\nwith her?'\n\nMr. Oldeschole's door opened, and out of it came Mr. Oldeschole, and Mr.\nSnape following him. What means the clerk had used to bring forth the\nSecretary need not now be inquired. Forth they both came, and passed\nalong the passage, brushing close by Charley and Mrs. Davis; Mr.\nOldeschole, when he saw that one of the clerks was talking to a woman\nwho apparently was crying, looked very intently on the ground, and\npassed by with a quick step; Mr. Snape looked as intently at the woman,\nand passed very slowly. Each acted according to his lights.\n\n'I don't mean gammon at all, Mrs. Davis--indeed, I don't--I'll be there\non Tuesday night certainly, if not sooner--I will indeed--I shall be in\na desperate scrape if they see me here talking to you any longer; there\nis a rule against women being in the office at all.'\n\n'And there's a rule against the clerks marrying, I suppose,' said Mrs.\nDavis.\n\nThe colloquy ended in Charley promising to spend the Saturday evening at\nthe 'Cat and Whistle,' with the view of then and there settling what\nhe meant to do about 'that there girl'; nothing short of such an\nundertaking on his part would induce Mrs. Davis to budge. Had she known\nher advantage she might have made even better terms. He would almost\nrather have given her a written promise to marry her barmaid, than have\nsuffered her to remain there till Mr. Oldeschole should return and see\nher there again. So Mrs. Davis, with her basket and pocket-handkerchief,\nwent her way about her marketing, and Charley, as he returned to his\nroom, gave the strictest injunctions to the messenger that not, on any\nground or excuse whatever, was any woman to be again allowed to see him\nat the office.\n\nWhen, therefore, on the fine summer morning, with the early daylight\nall bright around him, Charley walked home from Mrs. Val's party, he\nnaturally felt sad enough. He had one sixpence left in his pocket;\nhe was engaged to spend the evening of the following day with the\ndelightful Norah at the 'Cat and Whistle,' then and there to plight her\nhis troth, in whatever formal and most irretrievable manner Mrs. Davis\nmight choose to devise; and as he thought of these things he had ringing\nin his ears the last sounds of that angel voice, 'You will be steady,\nCharley, won't you? I know you will, dear Charley--won't you now?'\n\nSteady! Would not the best thing for him be to step down to Waterloo\nBridge and throw himself over? He still had money enough left to pay the\ntoll--though not enough to hire a pistol. And so he went home and got\ninto bed.\n\nOn that same day, the day that was to witness Charley's betrothal to\nMiss Geraghty, and that of M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe with Miss Golightly, Alaric\nTudor had an appointment with Sir Gregory Hardlines at the new office\nof the Civil Service Examination Board. Alaric had been invited to wait\nupon the great man, in terms which made him perfectly understand that\nthe communication to be made was one which would not be unpleasing or\nuncomplimentary to himself. Indeed, he pretty well guessed what was to\nbe said to him. Since his promotion at the Weights and Measures he had\ngone on rising in estimation as a man of value to the Civil Service at\nlarge. Nearly two years had now passed since that date, and in these\npages nothing has been said of his official career during the time. It\nhad, however, been everything that he or his friends could have wished\nit to be. He had so put himself forward as absolutely to have satisfied\nthe actual chief clerk of his office, and was even felt by some of the\nsecretaries to be treading very closely on their heels.\n\nAnd yet a great portion of his time had been spent, not at the Weights\nand Measures, but in giving some sort of special assistance to Sir\nGregory's Board. The authorities at the Weights and Measures did not\nmiss him; they would have been well content that he should have remained\nfor ever with Sir Gregory.\n\nHe had also become somewhat known to the official world, even beyond the\nconfines of the Weights and Measures, or the Examination Board. He had\nchanged his club, and now belonged to the Downing. He had there been\nintroduced by his friend Undy to many men, whom to know should be the\nvery breath in the nostrils of a rising official aspirant. Mr. Whip\nVigil, of the Treasury, had more than once taken him by the hand, and\neven the Chancellor of the Exchequer usually nodded to him whenever that\no'ertasked functionary found a moment to look in at the official club.\n\nThings had not been going quite smoothly at the Examination Board.\nTidings had got about that Mr. Jobbles was interfering with Sir Gregory,\nand that Sir Gregory didn't like it. To be sure, when this had been\nindiscreetly alluded to in the House by one of those gentlemen who\npass their leisure hours in looking out for raws in the hide of the\nGovernment carcass, some other gentleman, some gentleman from the\nTreasury bench, had been able to give a very satisfactory reply. For\nwhy, indeed, should any gentleman sit on the Treasury bench if he be\nnot able, when so questioned, to give very satisfactory replies? Giving\nsatisfactory replies to ill-natured questions is, one may say, the\nconstitutional work of such gentlemen, who have generally well learned\nhow to do so, and earned their present places by asking the selfsame\nquestions themselves, when seated as younger men in other parts of the\nHouse.\n\nBut though the answer given in this instance was so eminently\nsatisfactory as to draw down quite a chorus of triumphant acclamations\nfrom the official supporters of Government, nevertheless things had not\ngone on at the Board quite as smoothly as might have been desirable. Mr.\nJobbles was enthusiastically intent on examining the whole adult male\npopulation of Great Britain, and had gone so far as to hint that\nfemale competitors might, at some future time, be made subject to his\nall-measuring rule and compass. Sir Gregory, however, who, having passed\nhis early days in an office, may, perhaps, be supposed to have had\nsome slight prejudice remaining in favour of ancient customs, was not\ninclined to travel so quickly. Moreover, he preferred following his own\nlead, to taking any other lead whatever that Mr. Jobbles might point out\nas preferable.\n\nMr. Jobbles wanted to crush all patronage at a blow; any system of\npatronage would lamentably limit the number of candidates among whom his\nexamination papers would be distributed. He longed to behold, crowding\naround him, an attendance as copious as Mr. Spurgeon's, and to see every\nhead bowed over the posing questions which he should have dictated. No\nlegion could be too many for him. He longed to be at this great work;\nbut his energies were crushed by the opposition of his colleagues. Sir\nGregory thought--and Sir Warwick, though he hardly gave a firm support\nto Sir Gregory, would not lend his countenance to Mr. Jobbles--Sir\nGregory thought that enough would be done for the present, if they\nmerely provided that every one admitted into the Service should be\neducated in such a manner as to be fit for any profession or calling\nunder the sun; and that, with this slight proviso, the question of\npatronage might for the present remain untouched. 'Do you,' he would\nhave said to the great officers of Government, 'appoint whom you like.\nIn this respect remain quite unfettered. I, however, I am the St. Peter\nto whom are confided the keys of the Elysium. Do you send whatever\ncandidates you please: it is for me merely to say whether or not they\nshall enter.' But Mr. Jobbles would have gone much farther. He would\nhave had all mankind for candidates, and have selected from the whole\nmass those most worthy of the high reward. And so there was a split\nat the Examination Board, which was not to be healed even by the very\nsatisfactory reply given by the Treasury gentleman in the House of\nCommons.\n\nNeither Sir Gregory nor his rival were men likely to give way, and it\nsoon appeared manifest to the powers that be, that something must be\ndone. It therefore came to light that Mr. Jobbles had found that his\nclerical position was hardly compatible with a seat at a lay board, and\nhe retired to the more congenial duties of a comfortable prebendal stall\nat Westminster. 'So that by his close vicinity,' as was observed by a\nnewspaper that usually supported the Government, 'he might be able to be\nof material use, whenever his advice should be required by the Board of\nCommissioners.' Sir Gregory in the meantime was instructed to suggest\nthe name of another colleague; and, therefore, he sent for Alaric Tudor.\n\nAlaric, of course, knew well what had been going on at the Board. He had\nbeen Sir Gregory's confidential man all through; had worked out cases\nfor him, furnished him with arguments, backed his views, and had\nassisted him, whenever such a course had been necessary, in holding Mr.\nJobbles' head under the pump. Alaric knew well on which side his\nbread was buttered, and could see with a glance which star was in the\nascendant; he perfectly understood the points and merits of the winning\nhorse. He went in to win upon Sir Gregory, and he won. When Mr. Jobbles\nmade his last little speech at the Board, and retired to his house in\nthe Dean's yard, Alaric felt tolerably certain that he himself would be\ninvited to fill the vacant place.\n\nAnd he was so invited. 'That is \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year, at any rate,' said he\nto himself, as with many words of submissive gratitude he thanked his\npatron for the nomination. 'That is \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year. So far, so good.\nAnd now what must be the next step? Excelsior! It is very nice to be a\nCommissioner, and sit at a Board at Sir Gregory's right hand: much\nnicer than being a junior clerk at the Weights and Measures, like Harry\nNorman. But there are nicer things even than that; there are greater men\neven than Sir Gregory; richer figures than even \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year!'\n\nSo he went to his old office, wrote his resignation, and walked home\nmeditating to what next step above he should now aspire to rise.\n'Excelsior!' he still said to himself, 'Excelsior!'\n\nAt the same moment Charley was leaving the Internal Navigation, and as\nhe moved with unusual slowness down the steps, he bethought himself how\nhe might escape from the fangs of his Norah; how, if such might still\nbe possible, he might fit himself for the love of Katie Woodward.\nExcelsior! such also was the thought of his mind; but he did not dare to\nbring the word to utterance. It was destined that his thoughts should be\ninterrupted by no very friendly hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nOUTERMAN _v_ TUDOR\n\n\nCharley sat at his office on the Saturday afternoon, very meditative and\nunlike himself. What was he to do when his office hours were over? In\nthe first place he had not a shilling in the world to get his dinner.\nHis habit was to breakfast at home at his lodgings with Harry, and\nthen to dine, as best he might, at some tavern, if he had not the good\nfortune to be dining out. He had a little dinner bill at a house which\nhe frequented in the Strand; but the bill he knew had reached its\nculminating point. It would, he was aware, be necessary that it should\nbe decreased, not augmented, at the next commercial transaction which\nmight take place between him and the tavern-keeper.\n\nThis was not the first time by many in which he had been in a similar\nplight--but his resource in such case had been to tell the truth\ngallantly to his friend Mrs. Davis; and some sort of viands, not at all\nunprepossessing to him in his hunger, would always be forthcoming for\nhim at the 'Cat and Whistle.' This supply was now closed to him. Were\nhe, under his present circumstances, to seek for his dinner from the\nfair hands of Norah Geraghty, it would be tantamount to giving himself\nup as lost for ever.\n\nThis want of a dinner, however, was a small misfortune in comparison\nwith others which afflicted him. Should or should he not keep his\npromise to Mrs. Davis, and go to the 'Cat and Whistle' that evening?\nThat was the question which disturbed his equanimity, and hindered him\nfrom teasing Mr. Snape in his usual vivacious manner.\n\nAnd here let it not be said that Charley must be altogether despicable\nin being so weak; that he is not only a vulgar rake in his present\nhabits, but a fool also, and altogether spiritless, and of a low\ndisposition. Persons who may so argue of him, who so argue of those\nwhom they meet in the real living world, are ignorant of the twists and\nturns, and rapid changes in character which are brought about by outward\ncircumstances. Many a youth, abandoned by his friends to perdition on\naccount of his folly, might have yet prospered, had his character not\nbeen set down as gone, before, in truth, it was well formed. It is not\none calf only that should be killed for the returning prodigal. Oh,\nfathers, mothers, uncles, aunts, guardians, and elderly friends in\ngeneral, kill seven fatted calves if seven should unfortunately be\nnecessary!\n\nAnd then there was a third calamity. Charley had, at this moment, in his\npocket a certain document, which in civil but still somewhat peremptory\nlanguage invited him to meet a very celebrated learned pundit, being\nno less than one of Her Majesty's puisne judges, at some court in\nWestminster, to explain why he declined to pay to one Nathaniel\nOuterman, a tailor, the sum of &c., &c., &c.; and the document then\nwent on to say, that any hesitation on Charley's part to accept this\ninvitation would be regarded as great contempt shown to the said learned\npundit, and would be treated accordingly. Now Charley had not paid the\nslightest attention to this requisition from the judge. It would, he\nconceived, have been merely putting his head into the lion's mouth to do\nso. But yet he knew that such documents meant something; that the day of\ngrace was gone by, and that Mr. Nathaniel Outerman would very speedily\nhave him locked up.\n\nSo Charley sat meditative over his lock entries, and allowed even his\nproposed vengeance on Mr. Snape to be delayed.\n\n'I say, Charley,' said Scatterall, coming over and whispering to him,\n'you couldn't lend me half a crown, could you?'\n\nCharley said nothing, but looked on his brother navvy in a manner that\nmade any other kind of reply quite unnecessary.\n\n'I was afraid it was so,' said Scatterall, in a melancholy voice. And\nthen, as if by the brilliance of his thought he had suddenly recovered\nhis spirits, he made a little proposition.\n\n'I'll tell you what you might do, Charley. I put my watch up the spout\nlast week. It's a silver turnip, so I only got fifteen shillings;\nyours is a Cox and Savary, and it's gold. I'm sure you'd get \u00c2\u00a33 for it\neasily--perhaps \u00c2\u00a33 3s. Now, if you'll do that, and take my turnip\ndown, I'll let you have the turnip to wear, if you'll let me have ten\nshillings of the money. You see, you'd get clear--let me see how much.'\nAnd Scatterall went to work with a sheet of foolscap paper, endeavouring\nto make some estimate of what amount of ready cash Charley might have in\nhis pocket on completion of this delicate little arrangement.\n\n'You be d----,' said Charley.\n\n'You'll not do it, then?' said Dick.\n\nCharley merely repeated with a little more emphasis the speech which he\nhad just before made.\n\n'Oh, very well,' said Scatterall; 'there couldn't have been a fairer\nbargain; at least it was all on your side; for you would have had the\nwatch to wear, and nearly all the money too.'\n\nCharley still repeated the same little speech. This was uncivil; for it\nhad evidently been looked on by Scatterall as unsatisfactory.\n\n'Oh, very well,' said that gentleman, now in a state of mild anger--'only\nI saw that you had a fine new purse, and I thought you'd wish to\nhave something to put in it.'\n\nCharley again repeated his offensive mandate; but he did it in a spirit\nof bravado, in order to maintain his reputation. The allusion to the\npurse made him sadder than ever. He put his hand into his breast-pocket,\nand felt that it was near his heart: and then he fancied that he again\nheard her words--'You will be steady; won't you, dear Charley?'\n\nAt four o'clock, he was by no means in his usual hurry to go away, and\nhe sat there drawing patterns on his blotting-paper, and chopping up\na stick of sealing-wax with his penknife, in a very disconsolate way.\nScatterall went. Corkscrew went. Mr. Snape, having carefully brushed his\nhat and taken down from its accustomed peg the old cotton umbrella, also\ntook his departure; and the fourth navvy, who inhabited the same room,\nwent also. The iron-fingered hand of time struck a quarter past four\non the Somerset House clock, and still Charley Tudor lingered at his\noffice. The maid who came to sweep the room was thoroughly amazed, and\nknew that something must be wrong.\n\nJust as he was about to move, Mr. Oldeschole came bustling into\nthe room. 'Where is Corkscrew?' said he. 'Gone,' said Charley. 'And\nScatterall?' asked Oldeschole. 'Gone, sir,' said Charley. 'And Mr.\nSnape?' said the Secretary. 'Oh, he is gone, of course,' said Charley,\ntaking his revenge at last.\n\n'Then, Mr. Tudor, I must trouble you to copy these papers for me at\nonce. They are wanted immediately for Sir Gregory Hardlines.' It was\nquite clear that Mr. Oldeschole was very much in earnest about the job,\nand that he was rejoiced to find that he still had one clerk to aid him.\n\nCharley sat down and did the required work. On any other day he would\ngreatly have disliked such a summons, but now he did not care much about\nit. He made the copies, however, as quickly as he could, and then took\nthem in to Mr. Oldeschole.\n\nThe worthy Secretary rewarded him by a lecture; a lecture, however,\nwhich, as Charley well understood, was intended all in kindness. He told\nhim how Mr. Snape complained of him, how the office books told against\nhim, how the clerks talked, and all Somerset House made stories of\nhis grotesque iniquities. With penitential air Charley listened and\npromised. Mr. Oldeschole promised also that bygones should be bygones.\n'I wonder whether the old cock would lend me a five-pound note! I\ndare say he would,' said Charley to himself, as he left the office. He\nabstained, however, from asking for it.\n\nReturning to his room, he took his hat and went downstairs. As he was\nsauntering forth through the archway into the Strand, a man with a\ndecent coat but a very bad hat came up to him.\n\n'I'm afraid I must trouble you to go with me, Mr. Tudor,' said the man.\n\n'All right,' said Charley; 'Outerman, I suppose; isn't it?'\n\n'All right,' said the bailiff.\n\nAnd away the two walked together to a sponging-house in Cursitor Street.\n\nCharley had been arrested at the suit of Mr. Outerman, the tailor.\nHe perfectly understood the fact, and made no special objection to\nfollowing the bailiff. One case was at any rate off his mind; he could\nnot now, be his will to do so ever so good, keep his appointment with\nNorah Geraghty. Perhaps it was quite as well for him to be arrested\njust at this moment, as be left at liberty. It must have come sooner\nor later. So he walked on with the bailiff not without some feeling of\nconsolation.\n\nThe man had suggested to him a cab; but Charley had told him, without\nthe slightest _mauvaise honte_, that he had not about him the means of\npaying for a cab. The man again suggested that perhaps he had better\ngo home and get some money, as he would find it in Cursitor Street very\ndesirable to have some. To this Charley replied that neither had he any\nmoney at home.\n\n'That's blue,' said the man.\n\n'It is rather blue,' said Charley; and on they went very amicably\narm-in-arm.\n\nWe need not give any detailed description of Charley's prison-house. He\nwas luckily not detained there so long as to make it necessary that we\nshould become acquainted with his fellow-captives, or even have much\nintercourse with his jailers. He was taken to the sponging-house, and it\nwas there imparted to him that he had better send for two things--first\nof all for money, which was by far the more desirable of the two; and\nsecondly, for bail, which even if forthcoming was represented as being\nat best but a dubious advantage.\n\n'There's Mrs. Davis, she'd bail you, of course, and willing,' said the\nbailiff.\n\n'Mrs. Davis!' said Charley, surprised that the man should know aught of\nhis personal acquaintances.\n\n'Yes, Mrs. Davis of the 'Cat and Whistle.' She'd do it in course, along\nof Miss Geraghty.'\n\nCharley perceived with a shudder that his matrimonial arrangements were\nknown and talked of even in the distant world of Cursitor Street. He\ndeclined, however, the assistance of the landlady, which no doubt would\nhave been willingly forthcoming, and was divided between his three\nfriends, Alaric, Harry, and Mr. M'Ruen. Alaric was his cousin and his\nnatural resource in such a position, but he had lately rejected\nAlaric's advice, and now felt a disinclination to call upon him in\nhis difficulty. Harry he knew would assist him, would at once pay Mr.\nOuterman's bill, and relieve him from all immediate danger; but the\nsense of what he already owed to Norman made him unwilling to incur\nfurther obligations;--so he decided on sending for Mr. M'Ruen. In spite\nof his being so poorly supplied with immediate cash, it was surmised\nfrom his appearance, clothes, and known rank, that any little outlay\nmade in his behalf would be probably repaid, and he was therefore\nfurnished with a messenger on credit. This man was first to call at Mr.\nM'Ruen's with a note, and then to go to Charley's lodgings and get his\nbrushes, razors, &c., these being the first necessaries of life for\nwhich a man naturally looks when once overtaken by such a misfortune as\nthat with which Charley was now afflicted.\n\nIn the process of time the brushes and razors came, and so did Mr.\nM'Ruen.\n\n'This is very kind of you,' said Charley, in rather a doleful voice, for\nhe was already becoming tired of Cursitor Street.\n\nMr. M'Ruen twisted his head round inside his cravat, and put out three\nfingers by way of shaking hands with the prisoner.\n\n'You seem pretty comfortable here,' said M'Ruen. Charley dissented to\nthis, and said that he was extremely uncomfortable.\n\n'And what is it that I can do for you, Mr. Tudor?' said M'Ruen.\n\n'Do for me! Why, bail me, to be sure; they won't let me out unless\nsomebody bails me. You know I shan't run away.'\n\n'Bail you!' said M'Ruen.\n\n'Yes, bail me,' said Charley. 'You don't mean to say that you have any\nobjection?'\n\nMr. M'Ruen looked very sharply at his young client from head to foot. 'I\ndon't know about bail,' he said: 'it's very dangerous, very; why didn't\nyou send for Mr. Norman or your cousin?'\n\n'Because I didn't choose,' said Charley--'because I preferred sending to\nsome one I could pay for the trouble.'\n\n'Ha--ha--ha,' laughed M'Ruen; 'but that's just it--can you pay? You owe\nme a great deal of money, Mr. Tudor. You are so unpunctual, you know.'\n\n'There are two ways of telling that story,' said Charley; 'but come, I\ndon't want to quarrel with you about that now--you go bail for me now,\nand you'll find your advantage in it. You know that well enough.'\n\n'Ha--ha--ha,' laughed the good-humoured usurer; 'ha--ha--ha--well, upon\nmy word I don't know. You owe me a great deal of money, Mr. Tudor. Now,\nwhat o'clock is it by you, I wonder?'\n\nCharley took out his watch--the Cox and Savary, before alluded to--and\nsaid that it was past seven.\n\n'Aye; you've a very nice watch, I see. Come, Mr. Tudor, you owe me a\ngreat deal of money, and you are the most unpunctual young man I know;\nbut yet I don't like to see you distressed. I'll tell you what, now--do\nyou hand over your watch to me, just as a temporary loan--you can't want\nit here, you know; and I'll come down and bail you out to-morrow.'\n\nCharley declined dealing on these terms; and then Mr. M'Ruen at last\nwent away, leaving Charley to his fate, and lamenting quite pathetically\nthat he was such an unpunctual young man, so very unpunctual that it\nwas impossible to do anything to assist him. Charley, however, manfully\nresisted the second attack upon his devoted watch.\n\n'That's very blue, very blue indeed,' said the master of the house, as\nMr. M'Ruen took his departure--'ha'n't you got no huncles nor hants, nor\nnothin' of that sort?'\n\nCharley declared that he had lots of uncles and aunts, grandfathers and\ngrandmothers, and a perfect wealth of cousins, and that he would send\nfor some of the leading members of his family to-morrow. Satisfied with\nthis, the man supplied him with bread and cheese, gin and water, and\nplenty of tobacco; and, fortified with these comforts, Charley betook\nhimself at last very lugubriously, to a filthy, uninviting bed.\n\nHe had, we have seen, sent for his brushes, and hence came escape; but\nin a manner that he had little recked of, and of which, had he been\nasked, he would as little have approved. Mrs. Richards, his landlady,\nwas not slow in learning from the messenger how it came to pass that\nCharley wanted the articles of his toilet so suddenly demanded. 'Why,\nyou see, he's just been quodded,' said the boy.\n\nMrs. Richards was quite enough up to the world, and had dealt with\nyoung men long enough, to know what this meant; nor indeed was she\nmuch surprised. She had practical knowledge that Charley had no strong\npropensity to pay his debts, and she herself was not unaccustomed to\nanswer the emissaries of Mr. Outerman and other greedy tradesmen who\nwere similarly situated. To Mrs. Richards herself Charley was not in\ndebt, and she had therefore nothing to embitter her own feelings against\nhim. Indeed, she had all that fondness for him which a lodging-house\nkeeper generally has for a handsome, dissipated, easy-tempered young\nman; and when she heard that he had been 'quodded,' immediately made up\nher mind that steps must be taken for his release.\n\nBut what was she to do? Norman, who she was aware would 'unquod' him\nimmediately, if he were in the way, was down at Hampton, and was\nnot expected to be at his lodgings for two or three days. After some\ncogitation, Mrs. Richards resolved that there was nothing for it but to\ngo down to Hampton herself, and break the news to his friends. Charley\nwould not have been a bit obliged to her had he known it, but Mrs.\nRichards acted for the best. There was a train down to Hampton Court\nthat night, and a return train to bring her home again--so off she\nstarted.\n\nMrs. Woodward had on that same afternoon taken down Katie, who was still\nan invalid;--Norman had gone down with them, and was to remain there\nfor some few days--going up and down every morning and evening. Mrs.\nWoodward was sitting in the drawing-room; Linda and Katie were with her,\nthe latter lying in state on her sofa as invalid young ladies should\ndo; Captain Cuttwater was at Hampton Court, and Norman was on the water;\nwhen a fly from the railway made its way up to the door of the Cottage.\n\n'Mrs. Richards, ma'am,' said the demure parlour-maid, ushering in the\nlodging-house keeper, who in her church-going best made a very decent\nappearance.\n\n'Oh, Mrs. Richards, how are you?' said Mrs. Woodward, who knew the woman\nvery well--'pray sit down--are there any news from London?'\n\n'Oh, ma'am, such news--such bad news--Mister Charley--.' Up jumped Katie\nfrom her sofa and stood erect upon the floor. She stood there, with her\nmouth slightly open, with her eyes intently fixed on Mrs. Richards, with\nher little hands each firmly clenched, drawing her breath with hard,\nshort, palpitating efforts. There she stood, but said nothing.\n\n'Oh, Mrs. Richards--what is it?' said Mrs. Woodward; 'for Heaven's sake\nwhat is the matter?'\n\n'Oh, ma'am; he's been took,' said Mrs. Richards.\n\n'Took!' repeated Mrs. Woodward. 'Katie, dear Katie--sit down, my\nchild--sit down.'\n\n'Oh, mamma! oh, mamma!' said she, apparently unable to move, and\ncertainly all but unable to stand.\n\n'Tell us, Mrs. Richards, what is it--what has happened to Mr. Tudor?'\nand as she spoke Mrs. Woodward got up and passed her arm around her\nyounger daughter's waist--Linda also got up and joined the group.\n\n'Why, ma'am,' said Mrs. Richards, 'he's been took by the bailiffs, and\nnow he's in prison.'\n\nKatie did not faint. She never had fainted, and probably did not know\nthe way; but she clenched her hands still tighter, breathed harder than\nbefore, and repeated her appeal to her mother in a voice of agony. 'Oh,\nmamma! oh, mamma!'\n\nKatie had no very accurate conception of what an arrest for debt meant.\nShe knew that next to death imprisonment was the severest punishment\ninflicted on erring mortals, and she now heard that Charley was in\nprison. She did not stop to think whether it was for his life, or for\nsome more limited period. It was enough for her to know, that this\nterrible misfortune had come upon him, to him who, to her young fancy,\nwas so bright, so good, so clever, so excellent, upon him who had saved\nher life--upon him whom she so dearly loved.\n\n'Oh, mamma! oh, mamma!' she said, and then in agony she shut her eyes\nand shuddered violently.\n\nMrs. Woodward was greatly afflicted. She was indeed sorry to hear such\ntidings of Charley Tudor; but her grief was now deeper even than that.\nShe could not be longer blind to the sort of feeling which her child\nevinced for this young man; she could not think that these passionate\nbursts of overpowering sorrow were the result of mere childish\nfriendship; she could not but see that her Katie's bosom now held a\nwoman's heart, and that that heart was no longer her own.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Woodward reflected of what nature, of what sort, was this\nman whom she had allowed to associate with her darling, almost as a\nbrother does with his sister; whom she had warmed in her bosom till he\nhad found an opportunity of inflicting this deadly wound. With terrible\nbitterness she upbraided herself as she sat down and bade Mrs. Richards\ngo on with her tale. She knew that nothing which could now be said would\nadd to Katie's anguish.\n\nMrs. Richards' story was soon told. It simply amounted to this--that\n'Mister Charley,' as she always called him, had been arrested for debt\nat the suit of a tailor, and that she had learnt the circumstances from\nthe fact of the prisoner having sent for his brushes.\n\n'And so I thought the best thing was to come and tell Mr. Norman,' said\nMrs. Richards, concluding her speech.\n\nNothing could be done till Norman came in. Linda went out with Mrs.\nRichards to get some refreshment in the dining-room, and Mrs. Woodward\nsat with her arm round Katie's neck on the sofa, comforting her with\nkisses and little caressing touches, but saying nothing. Katie, still\nunconscious of her passion, gave way to spasmodic utterance of her own\ngrief.\n\n'Oh, mamma!' she said--' what can be done? What can we do? You will do\nsomething, mamma, won't you? Poor Charley! Dear Charley! Harry will do\nsomething--won't he? Won't Harry go to London, and do something?'\n\nMrs. Woodward did what she could to quiet her. Something should be done,\nshe said. They must wait till Harry came in, and then settle what was\nbest. Nothing could be done till Harry came in. 'You must be patient,\nKatie, or else you will make yourself really ill.'\n\nKatie became afraid that she would be sent off to bed on the score\nof her illness before Harry had come, and thus lose the advantage of\nhearing what was the step decided on. So she sat silent in the corner of\nher sofa feigning to be asleep, but pondering in her mind what sort\nof penalties were the penalties of imprisonment, how dreadful, how\nendurable, or how unendurable. Would they put chains on him? would they\nstarve him? would they cut off his beautiful brown hair?\n\nMrs. Woodward sat silent waiting for Harry's return. When first she had\nwatched Katie's extreme misery, and guessed the secret of her child's\nheart, she had felt something like hard, bitter anger against Charley.\nBut by degrees this feeling softened down. It was by no means natural to\nher, nor akin to her usual tenderness. After all, the fault hitherto was\nprobably more her own than his.\n\nMrs. Richards was sent back to town. She was thanked for the trouble she\nhad taken, and told that Mr. Norman would do in the matter all that was\nnecessary to be done. So she took her departure, and Linda returned to\nthe drawing-room.\n\nUnfortunately Captain Cuttwater came in first. They none of them\nmentioned Charley's misfortune to him. Charley was no favourite with\nUncle Bat, and his remarks would not have been of the most cheering\ntendency.\n\nAt last Norman came also. He came, as was his wont, through the\ndrawing-room window, and, throwing himself into a chair, began to tell\nthe girls how much they had lost by not joining him on the river.\n\n'Harry,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'step into the dining-room with me for a\nmoment.'\n\nHarry got up to follow her. Katie and Linda also instantly jumped from\ntheir seats to do the same. Mrs. Woodward looked round, and motioned\nto them to stay with their uncle. Linda obediently, though reluctantly,\nremained; but Katie's impulse was too strong for her. She gave\none imploring look at her mother, a look which Mrs. Woodward well\nunderstood, and then taking silence for consent, crept into the\ndining-room.\n\n'Harry,' said Mrs. Woodward, as soon as the dining-room door was closed,\n'Charley has been arrested;' and then she told him how Mrs. Richards\nhad been at the Cottage, and what was the nature of the tidings she had\nbrought.\n\nNorman was not much surprised, nor did he feign to be so. He took\nthe news so coolly that Katie almost hated him. 'Did she say who had\narrested him, or what was the amount?' he asked.\n\nMrs. Woodward replied that she knew no more than what she had already\ntold. Katie stood in the shade with her eyes fixed upon her cousin, but\nas yet she said nothing. How cruel, how stony-hearted must he be to hear\nsuch dreadful tidings and remain thus undisturbed! Had Charley heard\nthat Norman was arrested, he would have been half way to London by this\ntime. So, at least, thought Katie.\n\n'Something can be done for him, Harry, can there not? We must contrive\nto do something--eh, Harry?' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'I fear it is too late to do anything to-night,' said Harry, looking at\nhis watch. 'The last train is gone, and I could not possibly find him\nout before twelve.'\n\n'And to-morrow is Sunday,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Oh, Harry, pray do something!' said Katie, 'pray, pray, pray, do! Oh,\nHarry, think of Charley being in prison! Oh, Harry, he would do anything\nfor you!' and then she burst into tears, and caught hold of Harry's arm\nand the front of his coat to add force to her entreaty.\n\n'Katie,' said her mother, 'don't be so foolish. Harry will, of course,\ndo whatever is best.'\n\n'But, mamma, he says he will do nothing; why does he not go at once?'\n\n'I will go at once, dear Katie,' said he; 'I will go now directly. I\ndon't know whether we can set him free to-night, or even to-morrow, as\nto-morrow is Sunday; but it certainly shall be done on Monday, you may\nbe sure of that at any rate. Whatever can be done shall be done;' and,\nwithout further talk upon the subject, he took his hat and went his way.\n\n'May God Almighty bless him!' said Mrs. Woodward. 'How infinitely\ngreater are truth and honesty than any talent, however brilliant!' She\nspoke only to herself and no one even guessed what was the nature of the\ncomparison which she thus made.\n\nAs soon as Norman was gone, Katie went to bed: and in the morning she\nwas pronounced to be too unwell to get up. And, indeed, she was far from\nwell. During the night she only slept by short starts, and in her sleep\nshe was restless and uneasy; then, when she woke, she would burst out\ninto fits of tears, and lie sobbing hysterically till she slept again.\nIn the morning, Mrs. Woodward said something about Charley's misconduct,\nand this threw her into a wretched state of misery, from which nothing\nwould rouse her till her mother promised that the prodigal should not be\nthrown over and abandoned.\n\nPoor Mrs. Woodward was in a dreadful state of doubt as to what it now\nbehoved her to do. She felt that, however anxious she might be to assist\nCharley for his own sake, it was her bounden duty to separate him\nfrom her child. Whatever merits he might have--and in her eyes he had\nmany--at any rate he had not those which a mother would desire to see\nin the future husband of her daughter. He was profligate, extravagant,\ncareless, and idle; his prospects in life were in every respect bad;\nhe had no self-respect, no self-reliance, no moral strength. Was it not\nabsolutely necessary that she should put a stop to any love that might\nhave sprung up between such a man as this and her own young bright-eyed\ndarling?\n\nPut a stop to it! Yes, indeed, most expedient; nay, absolutely\nnecessary--if it were only possible. Now, when it was too late, she\nbegan to perceive that she had not known of what material her own child\nwas formed. At sixteen, Gertrude and Linda had in reality been little\nmore than children. In manner, Katie had been more childish even than\nthem, and yet--Mrs. Woodward, as she thought of these things, felt her\nheart faint within her.\n\nShe was resolved that, cost what it might, Charley must be banished\nfrom the Cottage. But at the first word of assumed displeasure that she\nuttered, Katie fell into such an agony of grief that her soft heart gave\nway, and she found herself obliged to promise that the sinner should be\nforgiven. Katie the while was entirely unconscious of the state of her\nown feelings. Had she thought that she loved him as women love, had\nany thought of such love and of him together even entered her mind, she\ncould not have talked of him as she now talked. Had he been her brother,\nshe could not have been less guarded in her protestations of affection,\nor more open in her appeals to her mother that he might be forgiven.\nSuch was her present state; but it was doomed that her eyes should soon\nbe opened, and that she should know her own sorrow.\n\nOn the Sunday afternoon, Norman returned to Hampton with the tidings\nthat Charley was once more a free man. The key of gold which he had\ntaken with him had been found potent enough to open all barriers, even\nthose with which the sanctity of Sunday had surrounded the prisoner. Mr.\nOuterman, and the bailiff, and the messenger, had all been paid their\nfull claims, and Charley, with his combs and brushes, had returned to\nthe more benign custody of Mrs. Richards.\n\n'And why didn't he come down with you?' said Katie to Norman, who had\ngone up to her bedroom to give her the good tidings.\n\nNorman looked at Mrs. Woodward, but made no reply.\n\n'He would probably prefer remaining in town at present,' said Mrs.\nWoodward. 'It will be more comfortable for him to do so.'\n\nAnd then Katie was left alone to meditate why Charley should be more\ncomfortable after his arrest in London than at Hampton; and after\na while she thought that she had surmised the truth. 'Poor Charley!\nperhaps he is ashamed. He need not be ashamed to come at any rate to\nme.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nEASY IS THE SLOPE OF HELL\n\n\nThe electors for the Tillietudlem district burghs, disgusted by the\nroguery of Mr. M'Buffer, and anxiously on the alert to replace him by a\nstrictly honest man, returned our friend Undy by a glorious majority.\nHe had no less than 312 votes, as opposed to 297, and though threatened\nwith the pains and penalties of a petition, he was not a little elated\nby his success. A petition with regard to the Tillietudlem burghs was\nalmost as much a matter of course as a contest; at any rate the threat\nof a petition was so. Undy, however, had lived through this before, and\ndid not fear but that he might do so again. Threatened folks live long;\nparliamentary petitions are very costly, and Undy's adversaries were, if\npossible, even in more need of money than himself.\n\nHe communicated his good fortune to his friend Alaric in the following\nletter:--\n\n'Bellenden Arms, Tillietudlem, July, 185-.\n\n'My DEAR DIRECTOR,\n\n'Here I am once more a constituent part of the legislative wisdom of the\nUnited Kingdom, thanks to the patriotic discretion of the pot-wallopers,\nburgage-tenants, and ten-pound freeholders of these loyal towns. The\nsituation is a proud one; I could only wish that it had been less\nexpensive. I am plucked as clean as ever was pigeon; and over and above\nthe loss of every feather I carried, old M'Cleury, my agent here, will\nhave a bill against me that will hardly be settled before the next\nelection. I do not complain, however; a man cannot have luxuries without\npaying for them; and this special luxury of serving one's country in\nParliament is one for which a man has so often to pay, without the\nsubsequent fruition of the thing paid for, that a successful candidate\nshould never grumble, however much he may have been mulcted. They\ntalk of a petition; but, thank God, there are still such things as\nrecognizances; and, moreover, to give M'Cleury his due, I do not think\nhe has left a hole open for them to work at. He is a thorough rascal,\nbut no man does better work.\n\n'I find there is already a slight rise in the West Corks. Keep your eye\nopen. If you find you can realize \u00c2\u00a34 4s. or even \u00c2\u00a34, sell, and let the\nWest of Cork and Ballydehob go straight to the devil. We should then\nbe able to do better with our money. But I doubt of such a sale with\nso large a stock as we hold. I got a letter yesterday from that Cork\nattorney, and I find that he is quite prepared to give way about the\nbranch. He wants his price, of course; and he must have it. When once we\nhave carried that point, then it will be plain sailing; our only regret\nthen will be that we didn't go further into it. The calls, of course,\nmust be met; I shall be able to do something in October, but shall not\nhave a shilling sooner--unless I sell, which I will not do under 80s.\n\n'I was delighted to hear of your promotion; not that you'll remain in\nthe shop long, but it gives you a better name and a better claim. Old\nGolightly was buried yesterday, as of course you have heard. Mrs. Val\nquite agrees with me that your name had better be put in as that of\nClem's trustee. She's going to marry that d---- Frenchman. What an\nunmitigated ass that cousin of yours must be! I can't say I admire her\ntaste; but nevertheless she is welcome for me. It would, however, be\nmost scandalous if we were to allow him to get possession of her money.\nHe would, as a matter of course, make ducks and drakes of it in no time.\nSpeculate probably in some Russian railway, or Polish mine, and lose\nevery shilling. You will of course see it tied up tight in the hands of\nthe trustees, and merely pay him, or if possible her, the interest of\nit. Now that I am once more in, I hope we shall be able to do something\nto protect the fortunes of married women.\n\n'You will be quite safe in laying out Clem's money, or a portion of it,\nin the West Corks. Indeed, I don't know how you could well do better\nwith it. You will find Figgs a mere shadow. I think we can pull through\nin this manner. If not we must get--to take our joint bill. He would\nsooner do that than have the works stopped. But then we should have to\npay a tremendous price for it.\n\n'So we were well out of the Mary Janes at last. The take last month was\nnext to nothing, and now she's full of water. Manylodes hung on till\njust the last, and yet got out on his feet after all. That fellow will\nmake a mint of money yet. What a pity that he should be such a rogue!\nIf he were honest, honest enough I mean to be trusted, he might do\nanything.\n\n'I shall leave this on Wednesday night, take the oaths on Thursday, and\nwill see you in the evening. M'Carthy Desmond will at once move that I\nbe put on the West Cork Committee, in place of Nogo, who won't act. My\nshares are all at present registered in Val's name. It will be well,\nhowever, to have them all transferred to you.\n\n'Yours ever,\n\n'U.S.\n\n'M'Cleury has pledged himself to put me in again without further\nexpense, if I have to stand before the next general election, in\nconsequence of taking place under Government. I earnestly hope his\nsincerity may be tried.'\n\nDuring the month of July, Alaric was busy enough. He had to do the work\nof his new office, to attend to his somewhat critical duties as director\nof the West Cork Railway, to look after the interests of Miss\nGolightly, whose marriage was to take place in August, and to watch the\nParliamentary career of his friend Undy, with whose pecuniary affairs he\nwas now bound up in a manner which he could not avoid feeling to be very\nperilous.\n\nJuly passed by, and was now over, and members were looking to be\nrelieved from their sultry labours, and to be allowed to seek air and\nexercise on the mountains. The Ballydehob branch line had received the\nsanction of Parliament through the means which the crafty Undy had\nso well understood how to use; but from some cause hitherto not\nsufficiently fathomed, the shares had continued to be depressed in value\nin spite of that desirable event. It was necessary, however, that calls\nshould be paid up to the amount of \u00c2\u00a35 a share, and as Undy and Alaric\nheld nearly a thousand shares between them, a large amount of money\nwas required. This, however, was made to be forthcoming from Miss\nGolightly's fortune.\n\nOn the first of August that interesting young lady was married to the\nman--shall we say of her heart or of her feet? The marriage went off\nvery nicely, but as we have already had one wedding, and as others\nmay perhaps be before us, we cannot spare much time or many pages to\ndescribe how Miss Golightly became Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe. The lady seemed\nwell pleased with everything that was done, and had even in secret\nbut one care in the world. There was to be a dance after she and her\nVictoire were gone, and she could not join in it!\n\nWe, however, are in the position, as regards Clementina, in which needy\ngentlemen not unfrequently place themselves with reference to rich\nheiresses. We have more concern with her money than herself. She was\nmarried, and M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe became the happy possessor of an income of\n\u00c2\u00a3800 a year. Everybody conceived him to behave well on the occasion.\nHe acknowledged that he had very little means of his own--about 4,000\nfrancs a year, from rents in Paris. He expressed himself willing to\nagree to any settlement, thinking, perhaps with wisdom, that he might in\nthis way best make sure of his wife's income, and was quite content\nwhen informed that he would receive his quarterly payments from so\nrespectable a source as one of Her Majesty's Commissioners for the\nregulation of the Civil Service. The Bank of France could not have\noffered better security.\n\nThus Alaric obtained full control of Miss Golightly's fortune: for\nFiggs, his co-trustee, was, as has been said, a shadow. He obtained the\nfull control of \u00c2\u00a320,000, and out of it he paid the calls due upon the\nWest Cork shares, held both by himself and Undy Scott. But he put a\nsalve upon his conscience, and among his private memoranda, appertaining\nto that lady's money affairs he made an entry, intelligible to any who\nmight read it, that he had so invested this money on her behalf. The\nentry was in itself a lie--a foolish, palpable lie--and yet he found in\nit something to quiet remorse and stupefy his conscience.\n\nUndy Scott had become tyrannical in his logic as soon as he had\npersuaded Alaric to make use of a portion of Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe's\nmarriage portion. 'You have taken part of the girl's money,' was Undy's\nargument; 'you have already converted to your own purposes so much of\nher fortune; it is absurd for you now to talk of conscience and honesty,\nof your high duties as a trustee, of the inviolable distinction between\nmeum and tuum. You have already shown that the distinction is not\ninviolable; let us have no more such nonsense; there are still\nleft \u00c2\u00a315,000 on which we can trade; open the till, and let us go on\nswimmingly with the business.'\n\nAlaric was not addressed absolutely in these words; he would not\nprobably have allowed the veil with which he still shrouded his\ndishonesty to be withdrawn with so rough a hand; but that which was said\nwas in effect the same. In September he left town for a few weeks and\nwent down to Scotland, still with Undy Scott. He had at first much\nliked this man's society, for Scott was gay, lively, clever, and a good\ncompanion at all points. But latterly he had become weary of him. He\nnow put up with him as men in business have to put up with partners whom\nthey may not like; or, perhaps, to speak the truth openly, he bore with\nhim as a rogue bears with his confederate, though he absolutely hates\nhis brother rogue on account of his very roguery. Alaric Tudor was now\na rogue; despite his high office, his grand ideas, his exalted ambition;\ndespite his talent, zeal, and well-directed official labours, he was a\nrogue; a thief, a villain who had stolen the money of the orphan, who\nhad undertaken a trust merely that he might break it; a robber, doubly\ndisgraced by being a robber with an education, a Bill Sykes without any\nof those excuses which a philanthropist cannot but make for wretches\nbrought up in infamy.\n\nAlas, alas! how is it that in these days such men become rogues? How is\nit that we see in such frightful instances the impotency of educated men\nto withstand the allurements of wealth? Men are not now more keen after\nthe pleasures which wealth can buy than were their forefathers. One\nwould rather say that they are less so. The rich labour now, and work\nwith an assiduity that often puts to shame the sweat in which the poor\nman earns his bread. The rich rogue, or the rogue that would be rich,\nis always a laborious man. He allows himself but little recreation, for\ndishonest labour admits of no cessation. His wheel is one which cannot\nrest without disclosing the nature of the works which move it. It is not\nfor pleasure that men\n\n  Put rancours in the vessel of their peace;\n\nnor yet primarily for ambition. Men do not wish to rise by treachery,\nor to become great through dishonesty. The object, the ultimate object,\nwhich a man sets before himself, is generally a good one. But he sets\nit up in so enviable a point of view, his imagination makes it so richly\ndesirable, by being gazed at it becomes so necessary to existence,\nthat its attainment is imperative. The object is good, but the means of\nattaining it--the path to the object--ah! there is the slip. Expediency\nis the dangerous wind by which so many of us have wrecked our little\nboats.\n\nAnd we do so more now than ever, because great ships, swimming in\ndeepest waters, have unluckily come safe to haven though wafted there\nby the same pernicious wind. Every great man, who gains a great end\nby dishonest means, does more to deteriorate his country and lower the\nstandard of his countrymen than legions of vulgar thieves, or nameless\nunaspiring rogues. Who has injured us so much in this way as he whose\nname still stands highest among modern politicians? Who has given so\ngreat a blow to political honesty, has done so much to banish from men's\nminds the idea of a life-ruling principle, as Sir Robert Peel?\n\nIt would shock many were we to attribute to him the roguery of the\nSadleirs and Camerons, of the Robsons and Redpaths of the present day;\nbut could we analyse causes and effects, we might perhaps do so with no\ninjustice. He has taught us as a great lesson, that a man who has before\nhim a mighty object may dispense with those old-fashioned rules of truth\nto his neighbours and honesty to his own principles, which should guide\nus in ordinary life. At what point ordinary life ends, at what\ncrisis objects may be considered great enough to justify the use of a\ndispensing power, that he has not taught us; that no Sir Robert Peel\ncan teach us; that must unfortunately be left to the judgement of the\nindividual. How prone we are, each of us, to look on our own object as\ngreat, how ready to make excuses for receiving such a lesson for\nour guide; how willing to think that we may be allowed to use this\ndispensing power ourselves--this experience teaches us in very plain\nlanguage.\n\nThrice in his political life did Sir Robert Peel change his\npolitical creed, and carry, or assist to carry, with more or less of\nself-gratulation, the measures of his adversaries. Thrice by doing so\nhe kept to himself that political power which he had fairly forfeited\nby previous opposition to the requirements of his country. Such an\napposition of circumstances is at any rate suspicious. But let us give\nhim credit for the expression of a true belief; of a belief at first\nthat the corn-laws should be maintained, and then of a belief that they\nshould not; let us, with a forced confidence in his personal honesty,\ndeclare so much of him; nevertheless, he should surely have felt, had he\nbeen politically as well as personally honest, that he was not the man\nto repeal them.\n\nBut it was necessary, his apologist will say, that the corn-laws should\nbe repealed; he saw the necessity, and yielded to it. It certainly was\nnecessary, very necessary, very unavoidable; absolutely necessary one\nmay say; a fact, which the united efforts of all the Peels of the day\ncould in nowise longer delay, having already delayed it to the utmost\nextent of their power. It was essential that the corn-laws should be\nrepealed; but by no means essential that this should be done by Sir\nRobert Peel.\n\nIt was a matter of indifference to us Englishmen who did the deed. But\nto Sir Robert Peel it was a matter of great moment that he should do\nit. He did it, and posterity will point at him as a politician without\npolicy, as a statesman without a principle, as a worshipper at the altar\nof expediency, to whom neither vows sworn to friends, nor declarations\nmade to his country, were in any way binding. Had Sir Robert Peel lived,\nand did the people now resolutely desire that the Church of England\nshould be abandoned, that Lords and Commons should bow the neck, that\nthe Crown should fall, who can believe that Sir Robert Peel would not\nbe ready to carry out their views? Readers, it may be that to you such\ndeeds as those are horrible even to be thought of or expressed; to me\nI own that they are so. So also to Sir Robert Peel was Catholic\nEmancipation horrible, so was Reform of Parliament, so was the Corn Law\nRepeal. They were horrible to him, horrible to be thought of, horrible\nto be expressed. But the people required these measures, and therefore\nhe carried them, arguing on their behalf with all the astuteness of a\npractised statesman.\n\nThat Sir Robert Peel should be a worshipper of expediency might be\nmatter of small moment to any but his biographer, were it not that we\nare so prone to copy the example of those whose names are ever in our\nmouths. It has now become the doctrine of a large class of politicians\nthat political honesty is unnecessary, slow, subversive of a man's\ninterests, and incompatible with quick onward movement. Such a doctrine\nin politics is to be deplored; but alas! who can confine it to politics?\nIt creeps with gradual, but still with sure and quick motion, into all\nthe doings of our daily life. How shall the man who has taught himself\nthat he may be false in the House of Commons, how shall he be true in\nthe Treasury chambers? or if false there, how true on the Exchange? and\nif false there, how shall he longer have any truth within him?\n\nAnd thus Alaric Tudor had become a rogue, and was obliged, as it were in\nhis own defence, to consort with a rogue. He went down to Scotland with\nUndy, leaving his wife and child at home, not because he could thus\nbest amuse his few leisure days, but because this new work of his,\nthis laborious trade of roguery, allowed him no leisure days. When can\nvillany have either days or hours of leisure?\n\nAmong other things to be done in the north, Alaric was to make\nacquaintance with the constituents of the little borough of Strathbogy,\nwhich it was his ambition to represent in the next Parliament.\nStrathbogy was on the confines of the Gaberlunzie property; and indeed\nthe lord's eldest son, who was the present member, lived almost within\nthe municipal boundary. Ca'stocks Cottage, as his residence was called,\nwas but a humble house for a peer's eldest son; but Mr. Scott was not\nashamed to live there, and there for a while he entertained his brother\nUndy and Alaric Tudor. Mr. Scott intended, when the present session was\nover, to retire from the labours of parliamentary life. It may be that\nhe thought that he had done enough for his country; it may be that the\nmen of Strathbogy thought that he had not done enough for them; it may\nbe that there was some family understanding between him and his brother.\nThis, however, was clear, that he did not intend to stand again himself,\nand that he professed himself ready to put forward Alaric Tudor as a\nworthy successor, and to give him the full benefit and weight of the\nGaberlunzie interest.\n\nBut not for nothing was Alaric to receive such important assistance.\n\n'There are but 312 electors altogether,' said Undy one morning as\nthey went out shooting, 'and out of these we can command a hundred and\ntwenty. It must be odd if you cannot get enough outsiders to turn them\ninto a majority. Indeed you may look on it as a certain seat. No man in\nEngland or Scotland could give you one more certain.'\n\nThis was not the first occasion on which Undy had spoken of all that he\nwas doing for his friend, and Alaric therefore, somewhat disgusted with\nthe subject, made no reply.\n\n'I never had things made so easy for me when I wasn't in,' continued\nUndy; 'nor have I ever found them so easy since. I don't suppose it will\ncost you above \u00c2\u00a3500, or at most \u00c2\u00a3600, altogether.'\n\n'Well, that will be a comfort,' said Alaric.\n\n'A comfort! why I should say it would. What with the election and\npetition together, Tillietudlem never cost me less than \u00c2\u00a32,000. It cost\nme just as much, too, when I was thrown out.'\n\n'That was a bore for you,' said Alaric.\n\n'Upon my word you take it rather coolly,' said Undy; 'another man would\nthank a fellow for putting such a nice thing in his way.'\n\n'If the obligation be so deep,' said Alaric, becoming very red in the\nface, 'I would rather not accept it. It is not too late for you to\ntake the cheaper seat to yourself, if you prefer it; and I will look\nelsewhere.'\n\n'Oh, of course; perhaps at Tillietudlem; but for Heaven's sake, my dear\nfellow, don't let us quarrel about it. You are perfectly welcome to\nwhatever assistance we can give you at Strathbogy. I only meant to say\nthat I hope it will be efficacious. And on the score of expense I'll\ntell you what we'll do--that is, if you think that fair; we'll put the\ncost of the two elections together, and share and share alike.'\n\n'Considering that the election will not take place for at least more\nthan twelve months, there will be time enough to settle that,' said\nAlaric.\n\n'Well, that's true, too,' said Undy; and then they went on, and for some\ntime separated on the mountain, complaining, when they met again, of\nthe game being scarce and the dogs wild, as men always do. But as they\nwalked home, Undy, who regretted the loss of good time, again began\nabout money matters.\n\n'How many of those bridge shares will you take?' said he. This was a\nprojected bridge from Poplar to Rotherhithe, which had been got up by\nsome city gentlemen, and as to which Undy Scott was, or pretended to be,\nvery sanguine.\n\n'None,' said Alaric. 'Unless I can get rid of those confounded West Cork\nand Ballydehobs, I can buy nothing more of anything.'\n\n'Believe me, my dear fellow, the Ballydehobs are no such confounded\nthings at all. If you are ever a rich man it will be through the\nBallydehobs. But what you say about the bridge shares is nonsense. You\nhave a large command of capital, and you cannot apply it better.'\n\nAlaric winced, and wished in his heart that Clementina Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe,\n_n\u00c3\u00a9e_ Golightly, with all her money, was buried deep in the bogs of\nBallydehob. Though he was a rogue, he could not yet bear his roguery\nwith comfort to himself. It sat, however, as easy on Undy as though he\nhad been to the manner born.\n\n'I have no capital now at my disposal,' said he; 'and I doubt whether I\nshould be doing right to lay out a ward's money in such a manner.'\n\nA slight smile came over Undy's gay unconcerned features; it was very\nslight, but nevertheless it was very eloquent and very offensive also.\nAlaric understood it well; it made him hate the owner of it, but it made\nhim hate himself still more.\n\n'It is as well to be hung for a sheep as for a lamb,' said Undy's smile;\n'and, moreover,' continued the smile, 'is it not ridiculous enough for\nyou, Alaric Tudor, rogue as you are, to profess to me, Undy Scott, rogue\nas I am, any solicitude as to your ward's welfare, seeing that you\nhave already taken to yourself, for your own dishonest purposes, a\nconsiderable slice of the fortune that has been trusted to your keeping?\nYou have done this, and yet you talk to me of not having capital at your\ndisposal! You have capital, and you will dispose of that capital for\nyour own purposes, as long as a shilling remains uninvested of your\nward's money. We are both rogues. God knows it, and you and I know it;\nbut I am not such a hypocritical rogue as to make mock boasts of my\nhonesty to my brother rogue.'\n\nThis was certainly a long speech to have been made by a smile which\ncrossed Mr. Scott's face but for a moment, but every word of it was\nthere expressed, and every word of it was there read. Alaric did not at\nall like being addressed so uncivilly. It seemed to tend but little to\nthat 'Excelsior' for which his soul panted; but what could he do? how\ncould he help himself? Was it not all true? could he contradict the\nsmile? Alas! it was true; it was useless for him now to attempt even\nto combat such smiles. 'Excelsior,' indeed! his future course might now\nprobably be called by some very different designation. Easy, very easy,\nis the slope of hell.\n\nBefore they had returned to Ca'stocks Cottage, Undy had succeeded in\npersuading his friend that the game must be played on--on and on, and\nout. If a man intends to make a fortune in the share-market he\nwill never do it by being bold one day and timid the next. No turf\nbetting-book can be made up safely except on consistent principles.\nHalf-measures are always ruinous. In matters of speculation one attempt\nis made safe by another. No man, it is true, can calculate accurately\nwhat may be the upshot of a single venture; but a sharp fellow may\ncalculate with a fair average of exactness what will be the aggregate\nupshot of many ventures. All mercantile fortunes have been made by the\nknowledge and understanding of this rule. If a man speculates but once\nand again, now and then, as it were, he must of course be a loser. He\nwill be playing a game which he does not understand, and playing it\nagainst men who do understand it. Men who so play always lose. But he\nwho speculates daily puts himself exactly in the reversed position. He\nplays a game which experience teaches him to play well, and he plays\ngenerally against men who have no such advantage. Of course he wins.\n\nAll these valuable lessons did Undy Scott teach to Alaric Tudor, and\nthe result was that Alaric agreed to order--for self and partner--a\nconsiderable number of shares in the Limehouse Bridge Company. Easy,\nvery easy, is the slope of hell.\n\nAnd then in the evening, on this evening and other evenings, on all\nevenings, they talked over the prospects of the West Cork and Ballydehob\nbranch, and of the Limehouse Bridge, which according to Undy's theory\nis destined to work quite a revolution in the East-end circles of the\nmetropolis. Undy had noble ideas about this bridge. The shares at the\npresent moment were greatly at a discount--so much the better, for they\ncould be bought at a cheaper rate; and they were sure to rise to some\nvery respectable figure as soon as Undy should have played out with\nreference to them the parliamentary game which he had in view.\n\nAnd so from morning to morning, and from night to night, they talked\nover their unholy trade till the price of shares and the sounds of sums\nof money entered into Alaric's soul. And this, perhaps, is one of the\ngreatest penalties to which men who embark in such trade are doomed,\nthat they can never shake off the remembrance of their calculations;\nthey can never drop the shop; they have no leisure, no ease; they can\nnever throw themselves with loose limbs and vacant mind at large upon\nthe world's green sward, and call children to come and play with them.\nAt the Weights and Measures Alaric's hours of business had been from ten\nto five. In Undy's office they continued from one noon till the next,\nincessantly; even in his dreams he was working in the share market.\n\nOn his return to town Alaric found a letter from Captain Cuttwater,\npressing very urgently for the repayment of his money. It had been lent\non the express understanding that it was to be repaid when Parliament\nbroke up. It was now the end of October, and Uncle Bat was becoming\nuneasy.\n\nAlaric, when he received the letter, crushed it in his hand, and cursed\nthe strictness of the man who had done so much for him. On the next day\nanother slice was taken from the fortune of Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe; and his\nmoney, with the interest, was remitted to Captain Cuttwater.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nMRS. WOODWARD'S REQUEST\n\n\nWe will now go back for a while to Hampton. The author, for one, does\nso with pleasure. Though those who dwell there be not angels, yet it is\nbetter to live with the Woodwards and Harry Norman, with Uncle Bat, or\neven with the unfortunate Charley, than with such as Alaric and Undy\nScott. The man who is ever looking after money is fitting company only\nfor the devils, of whom, indeed, he is already one.\n\nBut Charley cannot any longer be called one of the Cottage circle. It\nwas now the end of October, and since the day of his arrest, he had not\nyet been there. He had not been asked; nor would he go uninvited, as\nafter what had passed at Hampton Court Bridge he surely might have done.\n\nAnd consequently they were all unhappy. No one was more so than Charley.\nWhen the prospect of the happy evening with Norah had been so violently\ninterrupted by his arrest, he had, among his other messages, sent word\nto the 'Cat and Whistle,' excusing his absence by a statement of the\ntrue cause. From that day to this of which we are now speaking he had\nseen neither Mrs. Davis nor her fair prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nNor were they better contented at the Cottage. Mrs. Woodward was\nharassed by different feelings and different fears, which together made\nher very unhappy. Her Katie was still ill; not ill indeed so that she\nwas forced to keep her bed and receive daily visits from pernicious\ndoctors, but, nevertheless, so ill as to make a mother very anxious.\n\nShe had never been quite strong, quite herself, from the night of Mrs.\nVal's dance. The doctor who had attended her declared that her ducking\nin the river had given her cold: and that this, not having been duly\nchecked, still hung about her. Then she had been taken to a physician in\nLondon, who poked her on the back and tapped her on the breast, listened\nto her lungs through a wooden pipe--such was the account which Katie\ngave herself when she returned home--and prescribed rum and milk and\ncod-liver oil, declaring, with an authoritative nod, that there was no\norganic disease--as yet.\n\n'And what shall we do with her, doctor?' asked Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Go on with the rum and milk and cod-liver oil, you can't do better.'\n\n'And the cough, doctor?'\n\n'Why, if that doesn't go before the cold weather begins, you may as well\ntake her to Torquay for the winter.'\n\nOh! consumption, thou scourge of England's beauty! how many mothers,\ngasping with ill-suppressed fears, have listened to such words as\nthese--have listened and then hoped; listened again and hoped again with\nfainter hopes; have listened again, and then hoped no more!\n\nBut there was much on Mrs. Woodward's mind which she could not bring\nherself to tell to any doctor, but which still left in her breast an\nimpression that she was perhaps keeping back the true cause of Katie's\nillness. Charley had not been at Hampton since his arrest, and it was\nmanifest to all that Katie was therefore wretched.\n\n'But why do you not ask him, mamma?' she had urged when her mother\nsuggested that he stayed away because he did not like to show himself\nafter what had occurred. 'What will he think of us? he that saved my\nlife, mamma! Oh, mamma! you promised to forgive him. Do ask him. You\nknow he will come if you ask him.'\n\nMrs. Woodward could not explain to her--could not explain to any\none--why she did not invite him. Norman guessed it all, and Mrs.\nWoodward saw that he had done so; but still she could not talk to him\nof Katie's feelings, could not tell him that she feared her child was\nheart-laden with so sad a love. So Mrs. Woodward had no confidant in\nher sorrow, no counsel which she could seek to aid her own wavering\njudgement. It was prudent, she thought, that Katie and Charley should be\nkept apart. Prudent! was it not even imperative on her to save her child\nfrom such a fate? But then, when she saw the rosy cheek grow pale by\ndegrees, as she watched the plump little arms grow gradually thin and\nwan, as those high spirits fell, and that voice which had ever been so\nfrequent in the house and so clear,--when the sound of it became low and\nrare, then her heart would misgive her, and she would all but resolve\nto take the only step which she knew would bring a bright gleam on her\nchild's face, and give a happy tone to her darling's voice.\n\nDuring the earlier portion of these days, Katie had with eager constancy\nreiterated her request that Charley should be asked to Hampton; but of a\nsudden her prayers ceased. She spoke no more of Charley, asked no longer\nafter his coming, ceased even to inquire frequently of his welfare. But\nyet, when his name was mentioned, she would open wide her bright eyes,\nwould listen with all her ears, and show only too plainly to one who\nwatched her as a mother only can watch, what were the thoughts which\nfilled her heart.\n\n'Linda,' she had said one night, as they sat in their room, preparing\nthemselves for bed, 'Linda, why does not mamma invite Charley to come\ndown to Hampton?'\n\n'Oh! I don't know,' said Linda; who, however, if she did not know,\nwas not far wrong in the guess she made. 'I suppose she thinks he'd be\nashamed to show himself after having been in prison.'\n\n'Ashamed! Why should he be ashamed after so long? Didn't you hear Harry\nsay that the same thing often happens to young men? Is he never to come\nhere again? Dear Linda, I know you know; do tell me.'\n\n'Well, I'm sure I do not know, if that's not the reason.'\n\n'Oh! Linda, dear Linda, yes, you do,' said Katie, throwing herself\non her knees, resting her arms on her sister's lap, and looking up\nwistfully into her sister's face. Her long hair was streaming down her\nback; her white, naked feet peeped out from beneath her bedroom dress,\nand large tears glistened in her eyes. Who could have resisted the\nprayers of such a suppliant? Certainly not Linda, the soft-hearted\nLinda.\n\n'Do tell me,' continued Katie, 'do tell me--I am sure you know; and,\nLinda, if it is wrong to ask mamma about it, I'll never, never ask her\nagain. I know mamma is unhappy about it. If my asking is wrong, I'll not\nmake her unhappy any more in that way.'\n\nLinda, for a while, did not know what to answer. Her hesitating manner\nimmediately revealed to Katie that there was a secret, and that her\nsister could tell it if she would.\n\n'Oh! Linda, do tell me, do tell me, dear Linda; you ought to tell me for\nmamma's sake.'\n\nAt last, with much hesitation, Linda told her the whole tale.\n\n'Perhaps mamma thinks that you are too fond of Charley.'\n\nAn instant light flashed across Katie's heart--across her heart, and\nbrain, and senses. Not another word was necessary to explain to her the\nwhole mystery, to tell the whole tale, to reveal to her the secret of\nher own love, of her mother's fears, and of his assumed unwillingness.\nShe got up slowly from her knees, kissed her sister's cheek and neck,\nsmiled at her so sweetly, so sadly, and then sitting on her old seat,\nbegan playing with her long hair, and gazing at vacancy.\n\n'It is only what I guess, you know, Katie--you would make me tell you,\nbut I am sure there is nothing in it.'\n\n'Dear Linda,' said she, 'you are so good; I am so much obliged to you.'\n\nAfter that Katie spoke no further of Charley. But it was evident to them\nall, that though she said nothing, she had not ceased to think of him.\nNor did her cheek again become rosy, nor her arms round, nor her voice\nhappy. She got weaker than ever, and poor Mrs. Woodward was overcome\nwith sorrow.\n\nNor was this the only cause of grief at Surbiton Cottage. During\nthe last few weeks a bitter estrangement had taken place between the\nWoodwards and the Tudors, Alaric Tudor, that is, and Gertrude. Two\nyears had now passed since Norman had chosen to quarrel with Alaric,\nand during all that period the two had never spoken amicably together,\nthough they had met on business very frequently; on all such occasions\nAlaric had been unperturbed and indifferent, whereas Norman had been\ngloomy, and had carried a hostile brow and angry eye. At their period\nof life, two years generally does much to quiet feelings of ill-will and\npacify animosity; but Norman's feelings had by no means been quieted,\nnor his animosity pacified. He had loved Alaric with a close and manly\nlove; now he hated him with a close and, I fear I may say, a manly\nhatred. Alaric had, as he thought, answered his love by treachery; and\nthere was that in Norman's heart which would not allow him to forgive\none who had been a traitor to him. He had that kind of selfishness so\ncommon to us, but of which we are so unconscious, which will not allow\nus to pardon a sin against our own _amour propre_. Alaric might have\nbeen forgiven, though he had taken his friend's money, distanced him in\nhis office, though he had committed against him all offences which one\nfriend can commit against another, all but this. Norman had been proud\nof his love, and yet ashamed of it--proud of loving such a girl as\nGertrude, and ashamed of being known to be in love at all. He had\nconfided his love to Alaric, and Alaric had robbed him of his love, and\nwounded both his pride and his shame.\n\nNorman lacked the charity which should have been capable of forgiving\neven this. He now looked at all Alaric's doings through a different\nglass from that which he had used when Alaric had been dear to him.\nHe saw, or thought that he saw, that his successful rival was false,\nambitious, treacherous, and dishonest; he made no excuses for him, gave\nhim no credit for his industry, accorded no admiration to his talent.\nHe never spoke ill of Alaric Tudor, to others; but he fed his own heart\nwith speaking and thinking ill of him to himself.\n\nOf Gertrude he thought very differently. He had taught himself to\ndisconnect her from the treachery of her husband--or rather her memory;\nfor, from the day on which he had learnt that she was engaged to Alaric,\nhe had never seen her. He still loved the remembrance of her. In his\nsolitary walks with Mrs. Woodward he would still speak of her as he\nmight of one in some distant clime, for whose welfare he was deeply\ninterested. He had seen and caressed her baby at Hampton. She was still\ndear to him. Had Alaric been called to his long account, it would have\nbeen his dearest wish to have become at some future time the husband of\nhis widow.\n\nTo all these feelings on Norman's part Alaric was very indifferent; but\ntheir existence operated as a drawback on his wife's comfort, and, to a\ncertain degree, on his own. Mrs. Woodward would not banish Norman from\nthe Cottage, even for her daughter's sake, and it came by degrees to\nbe understood that the Tudors, man and wife, should not go there unless\nthey were aware that Norman was absent. Norman, on the other hand, did\nabsent himself when it was understood that Alaric and Gertrude were\ncoming; and thus the Woodwards kept up their intercourse with both.\n\nBut this was a bore. Alaric thought it most probable that Norman would\nmarry one of the younger sisters, and he knew that family quarrels are\nuncomfortable and injudicious. When therefore he became a Civil Service\nCommissioner, and was thus removed from business intercourse with\nNorman, he conceived that it would be wise to arrange a reconciliation.\nHe discussed the matter with Gertrude, and she, fully agreeing with him,\nundertook the task of making the proposal through her mother. This\nshe did with all the kindness and delicacy of a woman. She desired her\nmother to tell Harry how much she had valued his friendship, how greatly\nshe regretted the loss of it, how anxious her husband was to renew, if\npossible, their former terms of affection. Mrs. Woodward, by no means\nsanguine, undertook the commission. She undertook it, and utterly\nfailed; and when Gertrude, in her disappointment, spoke bitterly of\nNorman's bitterness, both mother and sister, both Mrs. Woodward and\nLinda, took Norman's part.\n\n'I wish it could be otherwise,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'I wish it for all\nour sakes; but he is a man not easily to be turned, and I cannot blame\nhim. He has suffered very much.'\n\nGertrude became very red. Her mother's words contained a reproach\nagainst herself, tacit and unintended indeed, but not the less keenly\nfelt.\n\n'I am not aware that Mr. Norman has any cause of just complaint,' she\nsaid, 'against any one, unless it be himself. For the sake of charity\nand old associations we have wished that all ideas of injury should be\nforgiven and forgotten. If he chooses still to indulge his rancour, he\nmust do so. I had taken him to be a better Christian.'\n\nMore words had sprung from these. Mrs. Woodward, who, in truth, loved\nNorman the better for the continuance of his sorrow, would not give\nup his part; and so the mother and child parted, and the two sisters\nparted, not quarrelling indeed, not absolutely with angry words, but in\na tone of mind towards each other widely differing from that of former\nyears. Mrs. Woodward had lost none of the love of the parent; but\nGertrude had forgotten somewhat of the reverence of the child.\n\nAll this had added much to the grief created by Katie's illness.\n\nAnd then of a sudden Katie became silent, as well as sad and ill--silent\nand sad, but so soft, so loving in her manner. Her gentle\nlittle caresses, the tender love ever lying in her eye, the constant\npressure of her thin small hand, would all but break her mother's heart.\nKatie would sit beside her on the sofa in the drawing-room for hours;\na book, taken up as an excuse, would be in her lap, and she would sit\nthere gazing listlessly into the vacant daylight till the evening would\ncome; and then, when the room was shaded and sombre, when the light of\nthe fire merely served to make the objects indistinct, she would lean\ngently and by degrees upon her mother's bosom, would coax her mother's\narm round her neck, and would thus creep as it were into her mother's\nheart of hearts. And then slow tears would trickle down her cheeks,\nvery slow, one by one, till they would fall as telltales on her mother's\nhand.\n\n'Katie, my darling Katie,' the mother would say.\n\n'I'm only tired, mamma,' would be her answer. 'Don't move, mamma; pray\ndon't move. I am so comfortable.'\n\nAnd then at night she would put herself to rest close circled in Linda's\narms. She would twist up her little feet, and lie so quiet there, that\nLinda would remain motionless that she might not disturb her Katie's\nsleep; but soon warm tears would be running on her bosom, and she would\nknow that Katie was still thinking of her love.\n\nLinda, among all her virtues, had not that of reticence, and her mother\nhad soon learnt from her what had been said that night in their bedroom\nabout Charley. But this violation of confidence, if it was a violation,\nwas hardly necessary to make Mrs. Woodward aware of what was passing\nin her daughter's bosom. When Katie ceased to ask that Charley might\nbe sent for, when she ceased to plead for his pardon and to praise his\nvirtues, Mrs. Woodward knew well the cause of her silence. It was not\nthat others suspected her love, but that she had learned to suspect it\nherself. It was not that she was ashamed of loving Charley, but that she\nfelt at once that such love would distress her mother's heart.\n\nAs she sat there that night fingering her silken hair, she had asked\nherself whether in truth this man was master of her heart; she had\nprobed her young bosom, which now, by a sudden growth, became quick with\na woman's impulse, and she had owned to herself that she did love him.\nHe was dearer to her, she found, than all in the world beside. Fondly as\nshe loved her sister, sweet to her as were her mother's caresses, their\nlove was not as precious to her as his might be. And then she remembered\nwhat he was, what was the manner of his life, what his character; how\ndifferent he was from Alaric or Harry Norman; she remembered this,\nand knew that her love was an unhappy passion. Herself she would\nhave sacrificed: prisoner as he had been, debtor as he was, drunkard,\npenniless, and a spendthrift, she would not have hesitated to take him\nfor her guide through life, and have done what a woman might to guide\nhim in return. But she would not sacrifice her mother. She saw now why\nCharley was not asked, and silently acquiesced in his banishment.\n\nShe was not yet quite seventeen. Not yet seventeen! the reader will say.\nShe was still such a child, and yet arguing to herself about spendthrift\ndebtors and self-sacrifice! All this bombast at sixteen and a half.\nNo, my ungentle reader, not all this bombast at sixteen and a half. The\nbombast is mine. It is my fault if I cannot put into fitting language\nthe thoughts which God put into her young heart. In her mind's\nsoliloquy, Charley's vices were probably all summed up in the one word,\nunsteady. 'Why is he so unsteady? Why does he like these wicked things?'\nAnd then as regarded Mrs. Woodward, she did but make a resolve that\nnot even for her love would she add to the unhappiness of that loving,\ntenderest mother. There was no bombast in Katie, either expressed or\nunexpressed.\n\nAfter much consideration on the matter, Mrs. Woodward determined that\nshe should ask Charley down to the Cottage. In the first place, she\nfelt bitterly her apparent ingratitude to him. When last they had been\ntogether, the day after Katie's escape at the bridge, when his tale had\njust been read, she had told him, with the warmth of somewhat more\nthan friendly affection, that henceforth they must be more than common\nfriends. She had promised him her love, she had almost promised him the\naffection and care of a mother; and now how was she keeping her promise?\nHe had fallen into misfortune, and she had immediately deserted him.\nOver and over again she said to herself that her first duty was to her\nown child; but even with this reflection, she could hardly reconcile\nherself to her neglect of him.\n\nAnd then, moreover, she felt that it was impossible that all their\nfriendship, all their mutual regard, should die away suddenly without\nany explanation. An attempt to bring about this would not cure Katie's\nlove. If this were done, would not Katie always think of Charley's\nwrong?\n\nAnd, lastly, it was quite clear that Katie had put a check on her own\nheart. A meeting now might be the reverse of dangerous. It would be well\nthat Katie should use herself to be with him now again; well, at any\nrate, that she should see him once before their proposed journey to\nTorquay; for, alas, the journey to Torquay was now insisted on by the\nLondon physician--insisted on, although he opined with a nod, somewhat\nless authoritative than his former nod, that the young lady was touched\nby no organic disease.\n\n'And then,' said Mrs. Woodward to herself, 'his heart is good, and\nI will speak openly to him.' And so Charley was again invited to the\ncottage. After some demurring between him and Norman, he accepted the\ninvitation.\n\nMrs. Val's dance had taken place in June, and it was now late in\nOctober. Four months had intervened, and during that period Charley had\nseen none of the Woodwards. He had over and over again tried to convince\nhimself that this was his own fault, and that he had no right to accuse\nMrs. Woodward of ingratitude. But he was hardly successful. He did feel,\nin spite of himself, that he had been dropped because of the disgrace\nattaching to his arrest; that Mrs. Woodward had put him aside as\nbeing too bad to associate with her and her daughters; and that it was\nintended that henceforth they should be strangers.\n\nHe still had Katie's purse, and he made a sort of resolve that as long\nas he kept that in his possession, as long as he had that near his\nheart, he would not go near Norah Geraghty. This resolution he had kept;\nbut though he did not go to the 'Cat and Whistle,' he frequented other\nplaces which were as discreditable, or more so. He paid many very\nfruitless visits to Mr. M'Ruen; contrived to run up a score with the\nproprietor of the dancing saloon in Holborn; and was as negligent as\never in the matter of the lock entries.\n\n'It is no use now,' he would say to himself, when some aspirations for\nhigher things came across his heart; 'it is too late now to go back.\nThose who once cared for me have thrown me over.' And then he would\nagain think of Waterloo Bridge, and the Monument, and of what might be\ndone for threepence or fourpence in a pistol gallery.\n\nAnd then at last came the invitation to Hampton. He was once more to\ntalk to Mrs. Woodward, and associate with Linda--to see Katie once more.\nWhen he had last left the house he had almost been as much at home\nas any one of the family; and now he was to return to it as a perfect\nstranger. As he travelled down with Norman by the railway, he could not\nhelp feeling that the journey was passing over too quickly. He was like\na prisoner going to his doom. As he crossed the bridge, and remembered\nhow Katie had looked when she lay struggling in the water, how he had\nbeen f\u00c3\u00aated and caressed after pulling her out, he made a bitter contrast\nbetween his present position and that which he then enjoyed. Were it not\nfor very shame, he would have found it in his heart to return to London.\n\nAnd then in a moment they were at the Cottage door. The road had never\nbeen so short. Norman, who had not fathomed Charley's feelings, was\nhappy and light-hearted--more so than was usual with him, for he was\nunaffectedly glad to witness Charley's return to Hampton. He rang\nsharply at the door, and when it was opened, walked with happy\nconfidence into the drawing-room. Charley was bound to follow him, and\nthere he found himself again in the presence of Mrs. Woodward and her\ndaughters. Katie would fain have absented herself, but Mrs. Woodward\nknew that the first meeting could take place in no more favourable\nmanner.\n\nMrs. Woodward bade him welcome with a collected voice, and assured,\nif not easy manner. She shook hands with him cordially, and said a few\nwords as to her pleasure of seeing him again. Then he next took Linda's\nhand, and she too made a little speech, more awkwardly than her mother,\nsaying something mal \u00c3\u00a0 propos about the very long time he had been away;\nand then she laughed with a little titter, trying to recover herself.\nAnd at last he came to Katie. There was no getting over it. She\nalso stretched out her now thin hand, and Charley, as he touched it,\nperceived how altered she was. Katie looked up into his face, and tried\nto speak, but she could not articulate a word. She looked into his face,\nand then at Mrs. Woodward, as though imploring her mother's aid to tell\nher how to act or what to say; and then finding her power of utterance\nimpeded by rising sobs, she dropped back again on her seat, and hid her\nface upon the arm of the sofa.\n\n'Our Katie is not so well as when you last saw her--is she, Charley?'\nsaid Mrs. Woodward. 'She is very weak just now; but thank God she has,\nwe believe, no dangerous symptoms about her. You have heard, perhaps,\nthat we are going to Torquay for the winter?'\n\nAnd so they went on talking. The ice was broken and the worst was\nover. They did not talk, it is true, as in former days; there was no\nconfidence between them now, and each of them felt that there was none;\nbut they nevertheless fell into a way of unembarrassed conversation, and\nwere all tolerably at their ease.\n\nAnd then they went to dinner, and Charley was called on to discuss\nAdmiralty matters with Uncle Bat; and then he and Norman sat after\ndinner a little longer than usual; and then they had a short walk,\nduring which Katie remained at home; but short as it was, it was quite\nlong enough, for it was very dull; and then there was tea; and then more\nconstrained conversation, in which Katie took no part whatever; and then\nMrs. Woodward and the girls took their candles, and Charley went over to\nthe inn on the other side of the road. Oh! how different was this from\nthe former evenings at Surbiton Cottage.\n\nCharley had made no plan for any special interview with Katie; had,\nindeed, not specially thought about it at all; but he could not but feel\nan intense desire to say one word to her in private, and learn whether\nall her solicitude for him was over. 'Dear Charley, you will be steady;\nwon't you?' Those had been her last words to him. Nothing could have\nbeen sweeter; although they brought before his mind the remembrance\nof his own unworthy career, they had been inexpressibly sweet, as\ntestifying the interest she felt in him. And was that all over now? Had\nit all been talked away by Mrs. Woodward's cautious wisdom, because he\nhad lain for one night in a sponging-house?\n\nBut the next day came, and as it passed, it appeared to him that no\nopportunity of speaking one word to her was to be allowed to him.\n\nShe did not, however, shun him. She was not up at breakfast, but she sat\nnext to him at lunch, and answered him when he spoke to her.\n\nIn the evening they again went out to walk, and then Charley found that\nLinda and Norman went one way, and that he was alone with Mrs. Woodward.\nIt was manifest to him that this arrangement had been made on purpose,\nand he felt that he was to undergo some private conversation, the nature\nof which he dreaded. He dreaded it very much; when he heard it, it made\nhim very wretched; but it was not the less full of womanly affection and\nregard for him.\n\n'I cannot let you go from us, Charley,' began Mrs. Woodward, 'without\ntelling you how deep a sorrow it has been to me to be so long without\nseeing you. I know you have thought me very ungrateful.'\n\n'Ungrateful, Mrs. Woodward! 'O no! I have done nothing to make gratitude\nnecessary.'\n\n'Yes, Charley, you have--you have done much, too much. You have saved my\nchild's life.'\n\n'O no, I did not,' said he; 'besides, I hate gratitude. I don't want any\none to be grateful to me. Gratitude is almost as offensive as pity. Of\ncourse I pulled Kate out of the water when she fell in; and I would have\ndone as much for your favourite cat.' He said this with something of\nbitterness in his tone; it was not much, for though he felt bitterly he\ndid not intend to show it; but Mrs. Woodward's ear did not fail to catch\nit.\n\n'Don't be angry with us, Charley; don't make us more unhappy than we\nalready are.'\n\n'Unhappy!' said he, as though he thought that all the unhappiness in the\nworld was at the present moment reserved for his own shoulders.\n\n'Yes, we are not so happy now as we were when you were last with us.\nPoor Katie is very ill.'\n\n'But you don't think there is any danger, Mrs. Woodward?'\n\nThere are many tones in which such a question may be asked--and is\nasked from day to day--all differing widely from each other, and\ngiving evidence of various shades of feeling in the speaker. Charley\ninvoluntarily put his whole heart into it. Mrs. Woodward could not but\nlove him for feeling for her child, though she would have given so much\nthat the two might have been indifferent to each other.\n\n'I do not know,' she said. 'We hope not. But I should not be sent with\nher to Torquay if she were not very ill. She is very ill, and it is\nabsolutely essential that nothing should be allowed to excite her\npainfully. I tell you this, Charley, to excuse our apparent unkindness\nin not having you here sooner.'\n\nCharley walked by her in silence. Why should his coming excite her more\nthan Norman's? What could there be painful to her in seeing him? Did\nthe fact of his having been arrested attach to his visit any peculiar\nprobability of excitement?\n\n'Do not suppose that we have not thought of you,' continued Mrs.\nWoodward.' We have all done so daily. Nay, I have done so myself all but\nhourly. Ah, Charley, you will never know how truly I love you.'\n\nCharley's heart was as soft as it was inflammable. He was utterly unable\nto resist such tenderness as Mrs. Woodward showed to him. He had made\na little resolution to be stiff and stern, to ask for no favour and to\nreceive none, not to palliate his own conduct, or to allow Mrs. Woodward\nto condemn it. He had felt that as the Woodwards had given him up, they\nhad no longer any right to criticize him. To them at least, one and\nall, to Mrs. Woodward and her daughters, his conduct had been _sans\nreproche_. They had no cause to upbraid him on their own account; and\nthey had now abandoned the right to do so on his own. With such assumed\nsternness he began his walk; but now it had all melted before the warmth\nof one tender word from a woman's mouth.\n\n'I know I am not worth thinking about,' said he.\n\n'Do not say so; pray do not say so. Do not think that we say so to\nourselves. I grieve for your faults. Charley; I know they are grievous\nand wicked; but I know how much there is of good in you. I know how\nclever you are, how excellent your heart is, how sweet your disposition.\nI trust, I trust in God, you may reform, and be the pride of your\nfriends. I trust that I yet may be proud of knowing you----'\n\n'No one will ever be proud of me,' said Charley.\n\n'We shall all be proud of you, if you will resolve to turn away from\nchildish things now that you are no longer a child--your faults are\nfaults which as yet may be so easily relinquished. But, oh, Charley----'\nand then Mrs. Woodward paused and looked wistfully into his face. She\nhad now come to the point at which she had to make her prayer to him.\nShe had resolved to tell him the cause of her fears, and to trust to his\nhonour to free her from them. Now was the moment for her to speak out;\nbut now that the moment was come, the words were wanting.\n\nShe looked wistfully into his face, but he did not even guess what was\nher meaning. He knew the secret of his own love; but he did not know\nthat Katie also had her secret. He had never dreamt that his faults,\namong all their ill effects, had paled her cheek, made wan her arm,\nsilenced her voice, and dimmed her eye. When he had heard Katie cough,\nhe had in nowise connected the hated sound with his own arrest. He had\nthought only of his own love.\n\n'Oh! Charley--I know I can trust you,' said Mrs. Woodward. 'I know you\nare gentle and good. You will be gentle and good to us, will you not?\nyou will not make us all wretched?'\n\nCharley declared that he would not willingly do anything to cause pain\nto any of them.\n\n'No--I am sure you will not. And therefore, Charley, you must not see\nKatie any more.'\n\nAt this time they had turned off the road into a shady lane, in which\nthe leaves of autumn were beginning to fall. A path led over a stile\naway from the lane into the fields, and Mrs. Woodward had turned towards\nit, as though intending to continue their walk in that direction. But\nwhen she had reached the stile, she had sat down upon the steps of it,\nand Charley had been listening to her, standing by, leaning on the top\nrail.\n\n'And therefore, Charley, you must not see Katie any more.' So much she\nsaid, and then she looked into his face with imploring eyes.\n\nIt was impossible that he should answer her at once. He had to realize\nso much that had hitherto not been expressed between them, before he\ncould fully understand what she meant; and then he was called on to give\nup so much that he now learnt for the first time was within his reach!\nBefore he could answer her he had to assure himself that Katie loved\nhim; he had to understand that her love for one so abandoned was\nregarded as fatal; and he had to reply to a mother's prayer that he\nwould remove himself from the reach of a passion which to him was worth\nall the world beside.\n\nHe turned his face away from her, but still stood leaning on the stile,\nwith his arms folded on it. She watched him for a while in silence, and\nat last she saw big tears drop from his face on to the dust of the path\non the farther side. There they came rolling down, large globules of\nsorrow. Nothing is so painful to a woman as a man in tears, and Mrs.\nWoodward's heart was wrung to its very core. Why was he not like Alaric\nor Norman, so that she might make him welcome to her daughter's heart?\n\nShe leant towards him and put her hand caressingly on his arm. 'It shall\nbe so, shall it not, Charley?'\n\n'Oh, of course, if you say so.'\n\n'I have your word, then? If I have your word, that will be a perfect\nbond. I have your word, have I not, Charley?'\n\n'What!--never see her in my life?' said he, turning almost fiercely on\nMrs. Woodward.\n\n'That, you know, is more than you can promise,' said she, very gently.\n'It is not to the letter of the promise that I would bind you, but to\nits spirit. You understand well what I mean; you know what I wish, and\nwhy I wish it. Say that you will obey my wish, and I will leave the mode\nof doing it to your own honour. Have I your promise?'\n\nHe shook her hand off his arm almost roughly, though unintentionally,\nand turning sharply round leant with his back against the stile. The\ntraces of tears were still on his cheeks, but he was no longer crying;\nthere was, however, a look on his face of heart-rending sorrow which\nMrs. Woodward could hardly endure.\n\n'I do understand you,' said he, 'and since you demand it, I will\npromise;' and then they walked home side by side, without interchanging\na single word.\n\nWhen they reached the house, Mrs. Woodward went to her room, and Charley\nfound himself alone with Katie.\n\n'I hope you find yourself better this evening,' said he.\n\n'Oh, I am quite well,' she answered, with her sweetest, kindest voice;\n'I am quite well, only sometimes I am a little weak.'\n\nHe walked up to the window as though to pass on to the lawn; but the\nseason was too far advanced for that, and the window was locked. He\nretraced his steps, therefore, and passing out of the drawing-room into\nthe hall, stood at the open front door till he heard Mrs. Woodward come\ndown. Then he followed her into the room.\n\n'Good-bye,' he said to her suddenly; 'I shall start by the early train\nto-morrow, and shall not see you.' She pressed his hand, but he in\nnowise returned the pressure. 'Good-bye, Linda; good-bye, Katie; good\nnight, Captain Cuttwater.' And so he went his way, as Adam did when he\nwas driven out of Paradise.\n\nEarly on the following morning, the cook, while engaged in her most\nmatutinal duties, was disturbed by a ring at the front door. She, and\nshe only of the household, was up, and as she had not completed her\ntoilet with much minuteness, she was rather embarrassed when, on opening\nthe door, she saw Mr. Charles Tudor.\n\n'I beg your pardon, cook, for troubling you so early; but I have left\nsomething in the drawing-room. I can find it myself;' and, so saying, he\nhurried into the room, so as to prevent the servant from following him.\n\nKatie had a well-worn, well-known little workbox, which, in years now\nlong past; had been given to her either by Alaric or Harry. Doubtless\nshe had now work-boxes grander both in appearance and size; but,\nnevertheless, whether from habit or from choice, her custom was, in her\ndaily needlework, to use this old friend. Often and often had Charley\nplayed with it many wicked pranks. Once, while Katie had as yet no\npretension to be grown up, he had put a snail into it, and had incurred\nher severe displeasure. He had stuffed it full of acorns, and been\nrewarded by being pelted with them round the lawn; and had filled it\nwith nuts, for which he had not found it so difficult to obtain pardon.\nHe knew every hole and corner in it! he was intimate with all her little\nfeminine nicknacks--her silver thimble, her scissors, her bit of wax,\nand the yard-measure, which twisted itself in and out of an ivory\ncottage--he knew them all, as well as though they were his own; and he\nknew also where the workbox stood.\n\nHe closed the door behind him, and then, with his quickest motion,\nraised the lid and put within the box, just under the bit of work on\nwhich she was employed, a light small paper parcel. It contained the\npurse which she had worked for him, and had given to him with such sweet\naffection at the Chiswick flower-show.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nHOW APOLLO SAVED THE NAVVY\n\n\nAbout the middle of November, the Woodwards went to Torquay, and\nremained there till the following May. Norman went with them to see them\nproperly settled in their new lodgings, and visited them at Christmas,\nand once again during their stay there. He then went down to fetch them\nhome, and when they all returned, informed Charley, with whom he was\nstill living, that he was engaged to Linda. It was arranged, he said,\nthat they were to be married in August.\n\nOn the whole, the journey to Torquay was considered to have been\nsuccessful. Katie's health had been the only object in going there, and\nthe main consideration while they remained. She returned, if not well,\nat any rate not worse. She had got through the winter, and her lungs\nwere still pronounced to be free from those dreadful signs of decay, the\nname of which has broken so many mothers' hearts, and sent dismay into\nthe breasts of so many fathers. During her sojourn at Torquay she had\ngrown much, and, as is often the case with those who grow quickly, she\nhad become weak and thin. People at Torquay are always weak and thin,\nand Mrs. Woodward had not, therefore, been greatly frightened at this.\nHer spirits, though by no means such as they had been in former days,\nhad improved, she had occupied herself more than she had done during the\nlast two months at Hampton, and had, at least so Mrs. Woodward fondly\nflattered herself, ceased to be always thinking of Charley Tudor. It was\nquite clear that she had firmly made up her mind to some certain line of\nconduct with reference to him; she never mentioned his name, nor was\nit mentioned in her hearing by either her mother or sister during\ntheir stay at Torquay. When Norman came down, she always found some\nopportunity of inquiring from him as to Charley's health and welfare;\nbut she did this in a manner which showed that she had succeeded in\nplacing her feelings wonderfully under control.\n\nOn that Monday morning, on which Charley had returned to town after his\nearly visit to her workbox, she had not failed to find the purse. Linda\nwas with her when she did so, but she had contrived so to conceal her\nemotion, that nothing was seen and nothing suspected. She felt at once\nthat it was intended that all intercourse should be broken off between\nthem. She knew instinctively that this was the effect of some precaution\non her mother's part, and with a sad bosom and a broken heart, she\nacquiesced in it. She said nothing, even to herself, of the truth and\nconstancy of her love; she made no mental resolution against any other\npassion; she did not even think whether or not she might ever be tempted\nto love another; but she felt a dumb aching numbness about her heart;\nand, looking round about her, she seemed to feel that all was dark and\ndismal.\n\nAnd so they sojourned through the winter at Torquay. The effort which\nKatie made was undoubtedly salutary to her. She took again to her work\nand her lessons--studies we should probably now call them--and before\nshe left Torquay, she had again learned how to smile; but not to laugh\nwith that gay ringing silver laughter, ringing, but yet not loud, which\nto Charley's ear had been as sweet as heavenly music. During this time\nUncle Bat remained at Hampton, keeping bachelor's house by himself.\n\nAnd then while they were at Torquay, Linda and Norman became engaged\nto each other. Their loves were honest, true, and happy; but not of a\nnature to give much scope to a novelist of a romantic turn. Linda knew\nshe was not Norman's first love, and requited Norman, of course, by\ntelling him something, not much, of Alaric's falseness to her. Norman\nmade but one ungenerous stipulation. It was this: that in marrying him\nLinda must give up all acquaintance with her brother-in-law. He would\nnever, he said, be the means of separating two sisters; she and Gertrude\nmight have such intercourse together as their circumstances might render\npossible; but it was quite out of the question that either he, Harry\nNorman, or his wife, should ever again associate with Alaric Tudor.\n\nIn such matters Linda had always been guided by others; so she sighed\nand promised, and the engagement was duly ratified by all the parties\nconcerned.\n\nWe must now return to Charley. When he got back to town, he felt that he\nhad lost his amulet; his charm had gone from him, and he had nothing now\nleft whereby to save himself from ruin and destruction. He was utterly\nflung over by the Woodwards; that now was to him an undoubted fact. When\nMrs. Woodward told him that he was never again to see Katie, that was,\nof course, tantamount to turning him out of the Cottage. It might be\nall very well to talk to him of affection and friendship; but it was\nmanifest that no further signs of either were to be shown to him. He had\nproved himself to be unworthy, and was no more to be considered as\none of the circle which made the drawing-room at Surbiton Cottage its\ncentre. He could not quite explain all this to Norman, as he could not\ntell him what had passed between him and Mrs. Woodward; but he said\nenough to make his friend know that he intended to go to Hampton no\nmore.\n\nIt would be wrong, perhaps, to describe Charley as being angry with Mrs.\nWoodward. He knew that she was only doing her duty by her child; he knew\nthat she was actuated by the purest and best of motives; he was not able\nto say a word against her even to himself; but, nevertheless, he desired\nto be revenged on her--not by injuring her, not by injuring Katie--but\nby injuring himself. He would make Mrs. Woodward feel what she had done,\nby rushing, himself, on his own ruin. He would return to the 'Cat and\nWhistle'--he would keep his promise and marry Norah Geraghty--he would\ngo utterly to destruction, and then Mrs. Woodward would know and feel\nwhat she had done in banishing him from her daughter's presence!\n\nHaving arrived at this magnanimous resolution after a fortnight's doubt\nand misery, he proceeded to put his purpose into execution. It was now\nsome considerable time since he had been at the 'Cat and Whistle;' he\nhad had no further visit from Mrs. Davis, but he had received one or\ntwo notes both from her and Norah, to which, as long as he had Katie's\npurse, he was resolute in not replying; messages also had reached him\nfrom the landlady through Dick Scatterall, in the last of which he was\nreminded that there was a trifle due at the bar, and another trifle for\nmoney lent.\n\nOne night, having lashed himself up to a fit state of wretched\ndesperation, he found himself at the well-known corner of the street\nleading out of the Strand. On his journey thither he had been trying to\nrealize to himself what it would be to be the husband of Norah Geraghty;\nwhat would be the joy of returning to a small house in some dingy suburb\nand finding her to receive him. Could he really love her when she would\nbe bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, the wife of his bosom and\nthe mother of his children? In such a case would he ever be able to\nforget that he had known Katie Woodward? Would those words of hers ever\nring in his ears, then as now--'You will be steady, dear Charley; won't\nyou?'\n\nThere are those who boast that a gentleman must always be a gentleman;\nthat a man, let him marry whom he will, raises or degrades his wife to\nthe level of his own condition, and that King Cophetua could share his\nthrone with a beggar-woman without sullying its splendour or diminishing\nits glory. How a king may fare in such a condition, the author, knowing\nlittle of kings, will not pretend to say; nor yet will he offer an\nopinion whether a lowly match be fatally injurious to a marquess,\nduke, or earl; but this he will be bold to affirm, that a man from\nthe ordinary ranks of the upper classes, who has had the nurture of a\ngentleman, prepares for himself a hell on earth in taking a wife from\nany rank much below his own--a hell on earth, and, alas! too often\nanother hell elsewhere also. He must either leave her or loathe her.\nShe may be endowed with all those moral virtues which should adorn all\nwomen, and which, thank God, are common to women in this country; but\nhe will have to endure habits, manners, and ideas, which the close\ncontiguity of married life will force upon his disgusted palate,\nand which must banish all love. Man by instinct desires in his wife\nsomething softer, sweeter, more refined than himself; and though in\nfailing to obtain this, the fault may be all his own, he will not on\nthat account the more easily reconcile himself to the want.\n\nCharley knew that he was preparing such misery for himself. As he went\nalong, determined to commit a moral suicide by allying himself to the\nbarmaid, he constrained himself to look with his mind's eye 'upon this\npicture and on that.'\n\nHe had felt of what nature was the sort of love with which Katie\nWoodward had inspired his heart; and he felt also what was that other\nsort of love to which the charms of Norah Geraghty had given birth.\n\nNorah was a fine girl, smart enough in her outward apparel, but apt\noccasionally to disclose uncomfortable secrets, if from any accident\nmore than her outward apparel might momentarily become visible. When\ndressed up for a Sunday excursion she had her attractions, and even on\nordinary evenings, a young man such as Charley, after imbibing two or\nthree glasses of spirits and water, and smoking two or three cigars,\nmight find her to be what some of her friends would have called 'very\ngood company.' As to her mind, had Charley been asked about it, he would\nprobably have said that he was ignorant whether she had any; but this\nhe did know, that she was sharp and quick, alert in counting change, and\ngifted with a peculiar power of detecting bad coin by the touch. Such\nwas Norah Geraghty, whom Charley was to marry.\n\nAnd then that other portrait was limned with equal accuracy before his\neyes. Katie, with all her juvenile spirit, was delightfully feminine;\nevery motion of hers was easy, and every form into which she could twist\nher young limbs was graceful. She had all the nice ideas and ways which\na girl acquires when she grows from childhood to woman's stature, under\nthe eye of a mother who is a lady. Katie could be untidy on occasions;\nbut her very untidiness was inviting. All her belongings were nice; she\nhad no hidden secrets, the chance revealing of which would disgrace her.\nShe might come in from her island palaces in a guise which would call\ndown some would-be-censorious exclamation from her mother; but all\nothers but her mother would declare that Katie in such moments was more\nlovely than ever. And Katie's beauty pleased more than the eye--it came\nhome to the mind and heart of those who saw her. It spoke at once to the\nintelligence, and required, for its full appreciation, an exercise of\nthe mental faculties, as well as animal senses. If the owner of that\noutward form were bad or vile, one would be inclined to say that Nature\nmust have lied when she endowed her with so fair an index. Such was\nKatie Woodward, whom Charley was not to marry.\n\nAs he turned down Norfolk Street, he thought of all this, as the\ngambler, sitting with his razor before him with which he intends to cut\nhis throat, may be supposed to think of the stakes which he has failed\nto win, and the fortune he has failed to make. Norah Geraghty was\nCharley's razor, and he plunged boldly into the 'Cat and Whistle,'\ndetermined to draw it at once across his weasand, and sever himself for\never from all that is valuable in the world.\n\nIt was now about eleven o'clock, at which hour the 'Cat and Whistle'\ngenerally does its most stirring trade. This Charley knew; but he also\nknew that the little back parlour, even if there should be an inmate\nin it at the time of his going in, would soon be made private for his\npurposes.\n\nWhen he went in, Mrs. Davis was standing behind the counter, dressed in\na cap of wonderful grandeur, and a red tabinet gown, which rustled among\nthe pots and jars, sticking out from her to a tremendous width, inflated\nby its own magnificence and a substratum of crinoline. Charley had never\nbefore seen her arrayed in such royal robes. Her accustomed maid was\nwaiting as usual on the guests, and another girl also was assisting; but\nNorah did not appear to Charley's first impatient glance.\n\nHe at once saw that something wonderful was going on. The front parlour\nwas quite full, and the ministering angel was going in and out quickly,\nwith more generous supplies of the gifts of Bacchus than were usual\nat the 'Cat and Whistle.' Gin and water was the ordinary tipple in the\nfront parlour; and any one of its denizens inclined to cut a dash above\nhis neighbours generally did so with a bottom of brandy. But now Mrs.\nDavis was mixing port-wine negus as fast as her hands could make it.\n\nAnd then there were standing round the counter four or five customers,\nfaces well known to Charley, all of whom seemed to be dressed with a\nsplendour second only to that of the landlady. One man had on an almost\nnew brown frock coat with a black velvet collar, and white trousers.\nTwo had blue swallow-tailed coats with brass buttons; and a fourth, a\ndashing young lawyer's clerk from Clement's Inn, was absolutely stirring\na mixture, which he called a mint julep, with a yellow kid glove\ndangling out of his hand.\n\nThey all stood back when Charley entered; they had been accustomed to\nmake way for him in former days, and though he had latterly ceased to\nrule at the 'Cat and Whistle' as he once did, they were too generous to\ntrample on fallen greatness. He gave his hand to Mrs. Davis across the\ncounter, and asked her in the most unconcerned voice which he could\nassume what was in the wind. She tittered and laughed, told him he\nhad come too late for the fun, and then retreated into the little back\nparlour, whither he followed her. She was at any rate in a good humour,\nand seemed quite inclined to forgive his rather uncivil treatment of her\nnotes and messages.\n\nIn the back parlour Charley found more people drinking, and among them\nthree ladies of Mrs. Davis's acquaintance. They were all very fine in\ntheir apparel, and very comfortable as to their immediate employment,\nfor each had before her a glass of hot tipple. One of them, a\nflorid-faced dame about fifty, Charley had seen before, and knew to\nbe the wife of a pork butcher and sausage maker in the neighbourhood.\nDirectly he entered the room, Mrs. Davis formally introduced him to them\nall. 'A very particular friend of mine, Mrs. Allchops; and of Norah's\ntoo, I can assure you,' said Mrs. Davis.\n\n'Ah, Mr. Tudor, and how be you? A sight of you is good for sore eyes,'\nsaid she of the sausages, rising with some difficulty from her chair,\nand grasping Charley's hand with all the pleasant cordiality of old\nfriendship.\n\n'The gen'leman seems to be a little too late for the fair,' said a\nsevere lodging-house keeper from Cecil Street.\n\n  'Them as wills not, when they may,\n   When they wills they shall have nay,'\n\nsaid a sarcastic rival barmaid from a neighbouring public, to whom all\nNorah's wrongs and all Mr. Tudor's false promises were fully known.\n\nCharley was not the fellow to allow himself to be put down, even by\nfeminine raillery; so he plucked up his spirit, sad as he was at heart,\nand replied to them all _en masse_.\n\n'Well, ladies, what's in the wind now? You seem to be very cosy here,\nall of you; suppose you allow me to join you.'\n\n'With a 'eart and a 'alf,' said Mrs. Allchops, squeezing her corpulence\nup to the end of the horsehair sofa, so as to make room for him between\nherself and the poetic barmaid. 'I'd sooner have a gentleman next to me\nnor a lady hany day of the week; so come and sit down, my birdie.'\n\nBut Charley, as he was about to accept the invitation of his friend Mrs.\nAllchops, caught Mrs. Davis's eye, and followed her out of the room into\nthe passage. 'Step up to the landing, Mr. Tudor,' said she; and Charley\nstepped up. 'Come in here, Mr. Tudor--you won't mind my bedroom for\nonce.' And Charley followed her in, not minding her bedroom.\n\n'Of course you know what has happened, Mr. Tudor?' said she.\n\n'Devil a bit,' said Charley.\n\n'Laws, now--don't you indeed? Well, that is odd.'\n\n'How the deuce should I know? Where's Norah?'\n\n'Why--she's at Gravesend.'\n\n'At Gravesend--you don't mean to say she's----'\n\n'I just do then; she's just gone and got herself spliced to Peppermint\nthis morning. They had the banns said these last three Sundays; and this\nmorning they was at St. Martin's at eight o'clock, and has been here\njunketing ever since, and now they're away to Gravesend.'\n\n'Gravesend!' said Charley, struck by the suddenness of his rescue, as\nthe gambler would have been had some stranger seized the razor at the\nmoment when it was lifted to his throat.\n\n'Yes, Gravesend,' said Mrs. Davis; 'and they'll come up home to his own\nhouse by the first boat to-morrow.'\n\n'So Norah's married!' said Charley, with a slight access of sentimental\nsoftness in his voice.\n\n'She's been and done it now, Mr. Tudor, and no mistake; and it's better\nso, ain't it? Why, Lord love you, she'd never have done for you, you\nknow; and she's the very article for such a man as Peppermint.'\n\nThere was something good-natured in this, and so Charley felt it. As\nlong as Mrs. Davis could do anything to assist her cousin's views, by\nendeavouring to seduce or persuade her favourite lover into a marriage,\nshe left no stone unturned, working on her cousin's behalf. But now,\nnow that all those hopes were over, now that Norah had consented to\nsacrifice love to prudence, why should Mrs. Davis quarrel with an old\nfriend any longer?--why should not things be made pleasant to him as to\nthe others?\n\n'And now, Mr. Tudor, come down, and drink a glass to their healths, and\nwish 'em both well, and don't mind what them women says to you. You're\nwell out of a mess; and now it's all over, I'm glad it is as it is.'\n\nCharley went down and took his glass and drank 'prosperity to the bride\nand bridegroom.' The sarcastic rival barmaid said little snappish things\nto him, offered him a bit of green ribbon, and told him that if he\n'minded hisself,' somebody might, perhaps, take him yet. But Charley was\nproof against this.\n\nHe sat there about half an hour, and then went his way, shaking hands\nwith all the ladies and bowing to the gentlemen. On the following day,\nas soon as he left his office, he called at the 'Cat and Whistle,' and\npaid his little bill there, and said his last farewell to Mrs. Davis. He\nnever visited the house again. Now that Norah was gone the attractions\nwere not powerful. Reader, you and I will at the same time say our\nfarewells to Mrs. Davis, to Mr. Peppermint also, and to his bride. If\nthou art an elegant reader, unaccustomed to the contamination of pipes\nand glasses, I owe thee an apology in that thou hast been caused to\nlinger a while among things so unsavoury. But if thou art one who of\nthine own will hast taken thine ease in thine inn, hast enjoyed the\nfreedom of a sanded parlour, hast known 'that ginger is hot in the\nmouth,' and made thyself light-hearted with a yard of clay, then thou\nwilt confess there are worse establishments than the 'Cat and Whistle,'\nless generous landladies than Mrs. Davis.\n\nWhen all this happened the Woodwards had not been long at Torquay. Mr.\nPeppermint was made a happy man before Christmas; and therefore Charley\nwas left to drift before the wind without the ballast of any lady's love\nto keep him in sailing trim. Poor fellow! he had had wealth on one side,\nbeauty and love on another, and on the third all those useful qualities\nwhich Miss Geraghty has been described as possessing. He had been thus\nsurrounded by feminine attractions, and had lost them all. Two of those,\nfrom whom he had to choose, had married others, and he was banished from\nthe presence of the third. Under such circumstances what could he do but\ndrift about the gulfs and straits of the London ocean without compass or\nrudder, and bruise his timbers against all the sunken rocks that might\ncome in his way?\n\nAnd then Norman told him of his coming marriage, and Charley was more\nsad than ever. And thus matters went on with him till the period at\nwhich our story will be resumed at the return of the Woodwards to\nHampton.\n\nIn the meantime another winter and another spring had passed over\nAlaric's head, and now the full tide of the London season found him\nstill rising, and receiving every day more of the world's homage. Sir\nGregory Hardlines had had every reason to praise his own judgement in\nselecting Mr. Tudor for the vacant seat among the Magi.\n\nFrom that moment all had gone smooth with Sir Gregory; there was no one\nto interfere with his hobby, or run counter to his opinion. Alaric\nwas all that was conciliatory and amiable in a colleague. He was not\nsubmissive and cringing; and had he been so, Sir Gregory, to do him\njustice, would have been disgusted; but neither was he self-opinionated\nnor obstinate like Mr. Jobbles. He insisted on introducing no crotchets\nof his own, and allowed Sir Gregory all the credit of the Commission.\n\nThis all went on delightfully for a while; but on one morning, early\nin May, Alaric somewhat disturbed the equanimity of his chief by\ncommunicating to him his intention of becoming a candidate for the\nrepresentation of the borough of Strathbogy, at the next general\nelection, which was to take place very shortly after the close of the\nsession. Sir Gregory was dumbfounded, and expressed himself as incapable\nof believing that Tudor really meant to throw up \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year on\nthe mere speculation of its being possible that he should get into\nParliament. Men in general, as Sir Gregory endeavoured to explain with\nmuch eloquence, go into Parliament for the sake of getting places of\n\u00c2\u00a31,200 a year. For what earthly reason should Alaric again be going to\nthe bottom of the ladder, seeing that he had already attained a rung of\nsuch very respectable altitude? Alaric said to himself, 'Excelsior!' To\nSir Gregory he suggested that it might be possible that he should get\ninto Parliament without giving up his seat at the Board. Earth and\nheaven, it might be hoped, would not come together, even though so great\na violence as this should be done to the time-honoured practices of\nthe Government. Sir Gregory suggested that it was contrary to the\nconstitution. Alaric replied that the constitution had been put upon to\nas great an extent before this, and had survived. Sir Gregory regarded\nit as all but impossible, and declared it to be quite unusual. Alaric\nrejoined that something of the same kind had been done at the Poor Law\nBoard. To this Sir Gregory replied, gently pluming his feathers with\nconscious greatness, that at the Poor Law Board the chief of the\nCommission was the Parliamentary officer. Alaric declared that he was\nperfectly willing to give way if Sir Gregory would go into the House\nhimself. To this Sir Gregory demurred; not feeling himself called on to\nchange the sphere of his utility. And so the matter was debated between\nthem, till at last Sir Gregory promised to consult his friend the\nChancellor of the Exchequer. The ice was thus broken, and Alaric was\nquite contented with the part which he had taken in the conversation.\n\nWith his own official prospects, in spite of the hazardous step which he\nnow meditated, he was quite contented. He had an idea that in the public\nservice of the Government, as well as in all other services, men who\nwere known to be worth their wages would find employment. He was worth\nhis wages. Men who could serve their country well, who could adapt\nthemselves to work, who were practical, easy in harness, able to drive\nand patient to be driven, were not, unfortunately, as plentiful as\nblackberries. He began to perceive that a really useful man could not\nbe found miscellaneously under every hat in Pall Mall. He knew his own\nvalue, and did not fear but that he should find a price for it in some\nof the world's markets. He would not, therefore, allow himself to be\ndeterred from further progress by any fear that in doing so he risked\nthe security of his daily bread; no, not though the risk extended to\nhis wife; she had taken him for better or worse; if the better came she\nshould share it; if the worse, why let her share that also, with such\nconsolation as his affection might be able to offer.\n\nThere was something noble in this courage, in this lack of prudence. It\nmay be a question whether men, in marrying, do not become too prudent.\nA single man may risk anything, says the world; but a man with a wife\nshould be sure of his means. Why so? A man and a woman are but two\nunits. A man and a woman with ten children are but twelve units. It is\nsad to see a man starving--sad to see a woman starving--very sad to see\nchildren starving. But how often does it come to pass that the man who\nwill work is seen begging his bread? we may almost say never--unless,\nindeed, he be a clergyman. Let the idle man be sure of his wife's bread\nbefore he marries her; but the working man, one would say, may generally\ntrust to God's goodness without fear.\n\nWith his official career Alaric was, as we have said, well contented;\nin his stock-jobbing line of business he also had had moments of great\nexaltation, and some moments of considerable depression. The West Corks\nhad vacillated. Both he and Undy had sold and bought and sold again;\nand on the whole their stake in that stupendous national line of\naccommodation was not so all-absorbing as it had once been. But if money\nhad been withdrawn from this, it had been invested elsewhere, and the\ngreat sum borrowed from Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe's fortune had been in no\npart replaced--one full moiety of it had been taken--may one not say\nstolen?--to enable Alaric and Undy to continue their speculations.\n\nThe undertaking to which they were now both wedded was the Limehouse\nand Rotherhithe Bridge. Of this Undy was chairman, and Alaric was a\ndirector, and at the present moment they looked for ample fortune, or\nwhat would nearly be ample ruin, to the decision of a committee of the\nHouse of Commons which was about to sit with the view of making inquiry\nas to the necessity of the bridge in question.\n\nMr. Nogo, the member for Mile End, was the parent of this committee. He\nasserted that the matter was one of such vital importance not only to\nthe whole metropolis, but to the country at large, that the Government\nwere bound in the first place to give a large subsidy towards building\nthe bridge, and afterwards to pay a heavy annual sum towards the amount\nwhich it would be necessary to raise by tolls. Mr. Whip Vigil, on the\nother hand, declared on the part of Government that the bridge was\nwholly unnecessary; that if it were built it ought to be pulled down\nagain; and that not a stiver could be given out of the public purse with\nsuch an object.\n\nOn this they joined issue. Mr. Nogo prayed for a committee, and Mr.\nVigil, having duly consulted his higher brethren in the Government,\nconceded this point. It may easily be conceived how high were now the\nhopes both of Undy Scott and Alaric Tudor. It was not at all necessary\nfor them that the bridge should ever be built; that, probably, was\nout of the question; that, very likely, neither of them regarded as a\npossibility. But if a committee of the House of Commons could be got to\nsay that it ought to be built, they might safely calculate on selling\nout at a large profit.\n\nBut who were to sit on the committee? That was now the all-momentous\nquestion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTHE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE\n\n\nThere is a sport prevalent among the downs in Hampshire to which, though\nnot of a high degree, much interest is attached. Men and boys, with\nsocial glee and happy boyish shouts, congregate together on a\nhill-side, at the mouth of a narrow hole, and proceed, with the aid of\na well-trained bull-dog, to draw a badger. If the badger be at all\ncommendable in his class this is by no means an easy thing to do. He is\na sturdy animal, and well fortified with sharp and practised teeth; his\nhide is of the toughest; his paws of the strongest, and his dead power\nof resistance so great as to give him more than an equal chance with the\nbull-dog. The delighted sportsmen stand round listening to the growls\nand snarls, the tearings, gnawings, and bloody struggles of the\ncombatants within.--'Well done, badger!--Well done, bull-dog!--Draw him,\nbulldog!--Bite him, badger!' Each has his friends, and the interest of\nthe moment is intense. The badger, it is true, has done no harm. He has\nbeen doing as it was appointed for him to do, poor badger, in that hole\nof his. But then, why were badgers created but to be drawn? Why, indeed,\nbut to be drawn, or not to be drawn, as the case may be? See! the\nbull-dog returns minus an ear, with an eye hanging loose, his nether\nlip torn off, and one paw bitten through and through. Limping, dejected,\nbeaten, glaring fearfully from his one remaining eye, the dog comes out;\nand the badger within rolls himself up with affected ease, hiding his\nbloody wounds from the public eye.\n\nSo it is that the sport is played in Hampshire; and so also at\nWestminster--with a difference, however. In Hampshire the two brutes\nretain ever their appointed natures. The badger is always a badger,\nand the bull-dog never other than a bull-dog. At Westminster there is\na juster reciprocity of position. The badger when drawn has to take his\nplace outside the hole, and fight again for the home of his love; while\nthe victorious bull-dog assumes a state of badgerdom, dons the skin of\nhis enemy, and, in his turn, submits to be baited.\n\nThe pursuit is certainly full of interest, but it is somewhat deficient\nin dignity.\n\nThe parliamentary committee, which was to sit with reference to the\nLimehouse and Rotherhithe Bridge, had been one of the effects of a\nbaiting-match such as that above described. In this contest the enemies\nof the proud occupier of the den on the mountain-side had not been\ncontented to attempt to expel him with a single bull-dog. A whole pack\nhad been let loose at his devoted throat. Bull-dogs had been at him, and\nterriers, mastiffs, blood-hounds, lurchers, and curs; but so accustomed\nwas he to the contest, so knowing in his fence, so ready with all the\nweapons given to him by nature, that, in spite of the numbers and venom\nof his enemies, he had contrived to hold his own. Some leading hounds\nhad fallen to rise no more; others had retreated, yelping to their\nkennels, to lie quiet for a while, till time might give them courage\nfor a new attack. The country round was filled with the noise of their\nplaints, and the yowling and howling of canine defeat. The grey old\nbadger meanwhile sat proud in his hole, with all his badger kin around\nhim, and laughed his well-known badger laugh at his disconsolate foes.\nSuch a brock had not for years been seen in the country-side; so cool,\nso resolute, so knowing in his badger ways, so impregnable in his badger\nhole, and so good-humoured withal. He could bite full sore with those\nold teeth of his, and yet he never condescended to show them. A badger\nindeed of whom the country might well be proud!\n\nBut in the scramble of the fight some little curs had been permitted to\nrun away with some little bones; and, in this way, Mr. Nogo, the member\nfor Mile End, had been allowed to carry his motion for a committee to\ninquire as to the expediency of the Government's advancing a quarter of\na million towards the completion of that momentous national undertaking,\nthe building of a bridge from Limehouse to Rotherhithe.\n\nVery much had been said about this bridge, till men living out of the\nlight of parliamentary life, nine hundred and ninety-nine men, that is,\nout of every thousand in the Queen's dominions, had begun to think\nthat it was the great want of the age. Men living in the light, the\nsupporters of the bridge as well as its enemies, knew very well that\nsuch an erection was quite unneeded, and would in all probability never\nbe made. But then the firm of Blocks, Piles, and Cofferdam, who held a\nvast quantity of the bridge shares, and who were to be the contractors\nfor building it, had an all-powerful influence in the borough of\nLimehouse. Where would Mr. Nogo be if he did not cultivate the\nfriendship of such men as Blocks, Piles, and Cofferdam?\n\nAnd so Mr. Nogo, and those who acted with Mr. Nogo--men, that is, who\nhad little jobs of their own to do, and in the doing of which Mr. Nogo\noccasionally assisted, Undy Scott, for instance, and such-like--these\nmen, I say, had talked much about the bridge; and gentlemen on the\nTreasury bench, who could have afforded to show up the folly of the\nscheme, and to put Mr. Nogo down at once, had he been alone, felt\nthemselves under the necessity of temporizing. As to giving a penny\nof the public money for such a purpose, that they knew was out of the\nquestion; that Mr. Nogo never expected; that they all knew Mr. Nogo\nnever expected. But as Mr. Nogo's numbers were so respectable, it was\nnecessary to oppose him in a respectable parliamentary steady manner.\nHe had fifteen with him! Had he been quite alone, Mr. Vigil would have\nsneered him off; had he had but four to back him, the old badger would\nhave laughed them out of face with a brace of grins. But fifteen--! Mr.\nWhip Vigil thought that the committee would be the most safe. So would\nthe outer world be brought to confess that the interests of Limehouse\nand Poplar, Rotherhithe and Deptford, had not been overlooked by a\ncareful Government.\n\nBut of whom was the committee to be made up? That was now the question\nwhich to Mr. Nogo, in his hour of temporary greatness, was truly\nmomentous. He of course was to be the chairman, and to him appertained\nthe duty of naming the other members; of naming them indeed--so much he\ncould undoubtedly do by the strength of his own privilege. But of what\nuse to name a string of men to whom Mr. Vigil would not consent? Mr.\nNogo, did he do so, would have to divide on every name, and be beaten\nat every division. There would be no triumph in that. No; Mr. Nogo fully\nunderstood that his triumph must be achieved--if he were destined to a\ntriumph--by an astute skill in his selection, not by an open choice\nof friends. He must obtain a balance on his side, but one in which the\nscale would lean so slightly to his side that Mr. Vigil's eyes might be\ndeceived. Those who knew Mr. Vigil best were inclined to surmise that\nsuch an arrangement was somewhat beyond Mr. Nogo's political capacity.\nThere is a proverb which goes to show that a certain little lively\nanimal may be shaved if he be caught napping; but then the difficulty of\nso catching him is extreme.\n\nMr. Nogo, at the head of the list, put Mr. Vigil himself. This, of\ncourse, was a necessity to him--would that he could have dispensed with\nit! Then he named sundry supporters of the Government, sundry members\nalso of the opposition; and he filled up the list with certain others\nwho could not be regarded as sure supporters of one side or the\nother, but with whom, for certain reasons, he thought he might in this\nparticular case be safe. Undy Scott was of course not among the number,\nas Mr. Nogo would only have damaged his cause by naming a man known to\nhave a pecuniary interest in the concern.\n\nThe member for Mile End was doubtless sharp, but Mr. Vigil was sharper.\nHis object was, in fact, merely to do his duty to the country by\npreventing a profuse and useless expenditure of money. His anxiety was\na perfectly honest one--to save the Exchequer namely. But the\ncircumstances of the case required that he should fight the battle\naccording to the tactics of the House, and he well understood how to do\nso.\n\nWhen the list was read he objected to two or three names--only to two or\nthree. They were not those of staunch enemies of the Government; nor did\nhe propose in their places the names of staunch supporters. He suggested\ncertain gentlemen who, from their acquaintance with bridges, tolls,\nrivers, &c., would, as he said, be probably of use. He, also, was sure\nof his men, and as he succeeded with two of them, he was also pretty\nsure of his committee.\n\nAnd then the committee met, and a lot of witnesses were in attendance.\nThe chairman opened his case, and proceeded to prove, by the evidence\nof sundry most respectable men connected with Limehouse, and with the\nportions of Surrey and Kent lying immediately opposite to it, that the\nmost intense desire for friendly and commercial intercourse was felt;\nbut that, though absolutely close to each other, the districts were so\ndivided by adverse circumstances, circumstances which were monstrous\nconsidering the advance of science in the nineteenth century, that\nthe dearest friends were constrained to perpetual banishment from each\nother; and that the men of Kent were utterly unable to do any trade at\nLimehouse, and the Limehousians equally unable to carry on traffic in\nSurrey.\n\nIt was wonderful that the narrow river should be so effective for\ninjury. One gentleman from Poplar proved that, having given his daughter\nin marriage to a man of Deptford two years since, he had not yet been\nable to see her since that day. Her house, by the crow's flight, was but\nseven furlongs from his own; but, as he kept no horse, he could not get\nto her residence without a four hours' walk, for which he felt himself\nto be too old. He was, however, able to visit his married daughter at\nReading, and be back to tea. The witness declared that his life was made\nmiserable by his being thus debarred from his child, and he wiped his\neyes with his pocket-handkerchief piteously, sitting there in front of\nthe committee. In answer to Mr. Vigil he admitted that there might be a\nferry, but stated that he did not know. Having had, from childhood, an\naversion to the water, he had not inquired. He was aware that some rash\npeople had gone through the Tunnel, but for himself he did not think the\nTunnel a safe mode of transit.\n\nAnother gentleman belonging to Rotherhithe, who was obliged to be almost\ndaily at Blackwall, maintained two horses for the express purpose of\ngoing backwards and forwards, round by London Bridge. They cost him\n\u00c2\u00a370 per annum each. Such a bridge as that now proposed, and which the\ngentleman declared that he regarded as an embryo monument of national\nglory, would save him \u00c2\u00a3140 per annum. He then proceeded to make a little\nspeech about the spirit of the age, and the influence of routine, which\nhe described as a gloomy gnome. But his oratory was cruelly cut short by\nMr. Vigil, who demanded of him whether he ever used the river steamers.\nThe witness shuddered fearfully as he assured the committee that he\nnever did, and referred to the _Cricket_, whose boilers burst in the\nyear 1842; besides, he had, he said, his things to carry with him.\n\nAnother witness told how unsafe was the transit of heavy goods by barge\nfrom one side of the river to another. He had had a cargo of marine\nstores which would go to sea before their time. The strong ebb of the\ntide, joined to the river current, had positively carried the barge\naway, and its course had not been stopped till it had drifted on shore\nat Purfleet. He acknowledged that something had transpired of the\nbargemen being drunk, but he had no knowledge himself that such had been\nthe case. No other cargoes of his own had been carried away, but he\nhad heard that such was often the case. He thought that the bridge\nwas imperatively demanded. Would the tolls pay? He felt sure that\nthey would. Why, then, should not the bridge be built as a commercial\nspeculation, without Government aid? He thought that in such cases a\nfostering Government was bound to come forward and show the way. He had\na few shares in the bridge himself. He had paid up \u00c2\u00a31 a share. They were\nnow worth 2s. 6d. each. They had been worth nothing before the committee\nhad been ordered to sit. He declined to give any opinion as to what the\nshares would be worth if the money were granted.\n\nLadies at Limehouse proved that if there were a bridge they could save\n30s. a year each, by buying their tea and sugar at Rotherhithe; and so\nsingular are the usages of trade, that the ladies of Rotherhithe would\nbenefit their husbands equally, and return the compliment, by consuming\nthe bread of Limehouse. The shores of Kent were pining for the beef of\nthe opposite bank, and only too anxious to give in return the surplus\nstock of their own poultry.\n\n'Let but a bridge be opened,' as was asserted by one animated vendor of\nrope, 'and Poplar would soon rival Pimlico. Perhaps that might not be\ndesirable in the eyes of men who lived in the purlieus of the Court,\nand who were desirous to build no new bridge, except that over\nthe ornamental water in St. James's Park.' Upon uttering which the\nrope-vendor looked at Mr. Vigil as though he expected him to sink at\nonce under the table.\n\nMr. Blocks, of the great firm of Blocks, Piles, and Cofferdam, then came\nforward. He declared that a large sum of money was necessary before\nthis great national undertaking could be begun in a spirit worthy of the\nnineteenth century. It was intended to commence the approaches on each\nside of the river a quarter of a mile from the first abutment of the\nbridge, in order to acquire the necessary altitude without a steep\nascent. He then described what a glorious bridge this bridge would\nbe; how it would eclipse all bridges that had ever been built; how the\nfleets of all nations would ride under it; how many hundred thousand\nsquare feet of wrought iron would be consumed in its construction; how\nmany tons of Portland stone in the abutments, parapets, and supporting\nwalls; how much timber would be buried twenty fathoms deep in the mud of\nthe river; how many miles of paving-stone would be laid down. Mr. Blocks\nwent on with his astonishing figures till the committee were bewildered,\nand even Mr. Vigil, though well used to calculations, could hardly raise\nhis mind to the dimensions of the proposed undertaking.\n\nThe engineer followed, and showed how easily this great work could be\naccomplished. There was no difficulty, literally none. The patronage of\nthe Crown was all that was required. The engineer was asked whether by\nthe word patronage he meant money, and after a little laughing and a few\ncounter questions, he admitted that, in his estimation, patronage and\nmoney did mean the same thing.\n\nSuch was the case made out by the promoters of the bridge, and the\nchairman and his party were very sanguine of success. They conceived\nthat Mr. Blocks' figures had completely cowed their antagonists.\n\nMr. Vigil then took his case in hand, and brought forward his witnesses.\nIt now appeared that the intercourse between the people living on each\nside of the river was immense, and ever on the increase. Limehouse, it\nwould seem, had nothing to do but to go to Deptford, and that Deptford\nconsumed all its time in returning the visit. Little children were sent\nacross continually on the most trifling errands, going and coming for\none halfpenny. An immense income was made by the owners of the ferry. No\ntwo adjacent streets in London had more to do with each other than had\nthe lanes of Rotherhithe and the lanes of Limehouse. Westminster and\nLambeth were further apart, and less connected by friendly intercourse.\nThe frequenters of the ferry were found to outnumber the passengers over\nWaterloo Bridge by ten to one.\n\nIndeed, so lamentable a proposition as this of building a bridge across\nthe river had never before been mooted by the public. Men conversant\nwith such matters gave it as their opinion that no amount of tolls that\ncould reasonably be expected would pay one per cent on the money which\nit was proposed to expend; that sum, however, they stated, would not\nmore than half cover the full cost of the bridge. Traffic would be\nprohibited by the heavy charges which would be necessary, and the\nprobability would be that the ferry would still continue to be the\nordinary mode of crossing the river.\n\nA gentleman, accustomed to use strong figures of speech, declared that\nif such a bridge were built, the wisest course would be to sow the\nsurface with grass, and let it out for grazing. This witness was taken\nspecially in hand by Mr. Nogo, and targed very tightly. Mr. Vigil had\ncontrived to prove, out of the mouths of inimical witnesses, the very\nreverse of that which they had been summoned thither to assert. The\nsecret of the ferry had been first brought to the light by the gentleman\nwho could not visit his daughter at Deptford, and so on. These triumphs\nhad evidently been very pleasant to Mr. Vigil, and Mr. Nogo thought that\nhe might judiciously take a leaf out of the Treasury book. Actuated\nby this ambition, he, with the assistance of his friend, the M'Carthy\nDesmond, put no less than 2,250 questions to the gentleman who suggested\nthe grazing, in order to induce him to say, that if there were a bridge,\nmen would probably walk over it. But they could not bring him to own to\na single passenger, unless they would abandon the tolls. The most that\nthey could get from him was, that perhaps an old woman, with more money\nthan wit, might go over it on a Sunday afternoon, if--which he did not\nbelieve--any old woman existed, _in that part of the world_, who had\nmore money than wit.\n\nThis witness was kept in the chair for three days, during which Mr.\nVigil was nearly driven wild by the loss of his valuable time. But he\ndid not complain. Nor would he have complained, though he might have\nabsented himself, had the witness been kept in the chair three\nweeks instead of three days. The expense of the committee, including\nwitnesses, shorthand-writers, and printing, was about \u00c2\u00a360 a day, but\nit never occurred to any one of the number to get up and declare with\nindignation, that such a waste of money and time on so palpably absurd a\nscheme was degrading, and to demand an immediate close of their labours.\nIt all went smoothly to the end, and Mr. Nogo walked off from his task\nwith the approving conscience of a patriotic legislator.\n\nAt the close the members met to prepare their report. It was then the\nfirst week in August, and they were naturally in a hurry to finish their\nwork. It was now their duty to decide on the merits of what they had\nheard, to form a judgement as to the veracity of the witnesses, and\ndeclare, on behalf of the country which they represented, whether or no\nthis bridge should be built at the expense of the nation.\n\nWith his decision each was ready enough; but not one of them dreamed of\nbeing influenced by anything which had been said before them. All the\nworld--that is, all that were in any way concerned in the matter--knew\nthat the witnesses for the bridge were anxious to have it built, and\nthat the witnesses against the bridge were anxious to prevent the\nbuilding. It would be the worst of ignorance, ignorance of the usage of\nthe world we live in, to suppose that any member of Parliament could\nbe influenced by such manoeuvres. Besides, was not the mind of each man\nfully known before the committee met?\n\nVarious propositions were made by the members among themselves, and\nvarious amendments moved. The balance of the different parties had been\nnearly preserved. A decided victory was not to be expected on either\nside. At last the resolution to which the committee came was this:\n'That this committee is not prepared, under existing circumstances, to\nrecommend a grant of public money for the purpose of erecting a bridge\nat Limehouse; but that the committee consider that the matter is still\nopen to consideration should further evidence be adduced.'\n\nMr. Vigil was perfectly satisfied. He did not wish to acerbate the\nmember for Mile End, and was quite willing to give him a lift towards\nkeeping his seat for the borough, if able to do so without cost to the\npublic exchequer. At Limehouse the report of the committee was declared\nby certain persons to be as good as a decision in their favour; it was\nonly postponing the matter for another session. But Mr. Vigil knew that\nhe had carried his point, and the world soon agreed with him. He at\nleast did his work successfully, and, considering the circumstances of\nhis position, he did it with credit to himself.\n\nA huge blue volume was then published, containing, among other things,\nall Mr. Nogo's 2,250 questions and their answers; and so the Limehouse\nand Rotherhithe bridge dropped into oblivion and was forgotten.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTO STAND, OR NOT TO STAND\n\n\nSir Gregory Hardlines had been somewhat startled by Alaric's\nannouncement of his parliamentary intentions. It not unnaturally\noccurred to that great man that should Mr. Tudor succeed at Strathbogy,\nand should he also succeed in being allowed to hold his office and seat\ntogether, he, Tudor, would very soon become first fiddle at the Civil\nService Examination Board. This was a view of the matter which was by\nno means agreeable to Sir Gregory. Not for this had he devoted his time,\nhis energy, and the best powers of his mind to the office of which he\nwas at present the chief; not for this had he taken by the hand a young\nclerk, and brought him forward, and pushed him up, and seated him in\nhigh places. To have kept Mr. Jobbles would have been better than this;\nhe, at any rate, would not have aspired to parliamentary honours.\n\nAnd when Sir Gregory came to look into it, he hardly knew whether those\nbugbears with which he had tried to frighten Tudor were good serviceable\nbugbears, such as would stand the strain of such a man's logic and\nreason. Was there really any reason why one of the commissioners\nshould not sit in Parliament? Would his doing so be subversive of the\nconstitution? Or would the ministers of the day object to an additional\ncertain vote? This last point of view was one in which it did not at all\ndelight Sir Gregory to look at the subject in question. He determined\nthat he would not speak on the matter to the Chancellor of the\nExchequer, or to any of the Government wigs who might be considered to\nbe bigger wigs than himself.\n\nAnd Alaric thought over the matter coolly also. He looked at it till the\nbugbears shrank into utter insignificance; till they became no more\nthan forms of shreds and patches put up to frighten birds out of\ncherry-orchards.\n\nWhy should the constitution be wounded by the presence of one more\ncommissioner in Parliament? Why should not he do his public duty and\nhold his seat at the same time, as was done by so many others? But\nhe would have to go out if the ministry went out. That was another\ndifficulty, another bugbear, more substantial perhaps than the others;\nbut he was prepared to meet even that. He was a poor man; his profession\nwas that of the Civil Service; his ambition was to sit in Parliament. He\nwould see whether he could not combine his poverty with his profession,\nand with his ambition also. Sir Gregory resolved in his fear that\nhe would not speak to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the matter;\nAlaric, on the other hand, in his audacity, resolved that he would do\nso.\n\nIt was thus that Sir Gregory regarded the matter. 'See all that I have\ndone for this man,' said he to himself; 'see how I have warmed him in\nmy bosom, how I have lifted him to fortune and renown, how I have heaped\nbenefits on his head! If gratitude in this world be possible, that man\nshould be grateful to me; if one man can ever have another's interest at\nheart, that man should have a heartfelt anxiety as to my interest. And\nyet how is it? I have placed him in the chair next to my own, and now he\nis desirous of sitting above me!'\n\n'Twas thus Sir Gregory communed with himself. But Alaric's soliloquy was\nvery different. A listener who could have overheard both would hardly\nhave thought that the same question was being discussed by the two. 'I\nhave got so high,' said Alaric, 'by my own labour, by my own skill and\ntact; and why should I stop here? I have left my earliest colleagues far\nbehind me; have distanced those who were my competitors in the walk of\nlife; why should I not still go on and distance others also? why stop\nwhen I am only second or third? It is very natural that Sir Gregory\nshould wish to keep me out of Parliament; I cannot in the least blame\nhim; let us all fight as best each may for himself. He does not wish a\nhigher career; I do. Sir Gregory will now do all that he can to impede\nmy views, because they are antagonistic to his own; very well; I must\nonly work the harder to overcome his objections.' There was no word in\nall this of gratitude; there was no thought in Alaric's mind that it\nbehoved him to be grateful to Sir Gregory. It was for his own sake,\nnot for his pupil's, that Sir Gregory had brought this pupil forward.\nGrateful, indeed! In public life when is there time for gratitude? Who\never thinks of other interest than his own?\n\nSuch was Alaric's theory of life. But not the less would he have\nexpected gratitude from those whom he might serve. Such also very\nprobably was Sir Gregory's theory when he thought of those who had\nhelped him, instead of those whom he himself had helped.\n\nAnd so they met, and discussed Alaric's little proposition.\n\n'Since I saw you yesterday,' said Sir Gregory, 'I have been thinking\nmuch of what you were saying to me of your wish to go into Parliament.'\n\n'I am very much obliged to you,' said Alaric.\n\n'I need hardly tell you, Tudor, how anxious I am to further your\nadvancement. I greatly value your ability and diligence, and have shown\nthat I am anxious to make them serviceable to the public.'\n\n'I am fully aware that I owe you a great deal, Sir Gregory.'\n\n'Oh, I don't mean that; that's nothing; I am not thinking of myself. I\nonly want you to understand that I am truly anxious to see you take that\nline in public matters which may make your services most valuable to\nthe public, and which may redound the most to your own advantage. I have\nthought of what you said to me with the most mature deliberation, and I\nam persuaded that I shall best do my duty to you, and to the service,\nby recommending you to abandon altogether your idea of going into\nParliament.'\n\nSir Gregory said this in his weightiest manner. He endeavoured to assume\nsome of that authority with which he had erst cowed the young Tudor at\nthe Weights and Measures, and as he finished his speech he assumed a\nprofound look which ought to have been very convincing.\n\nBut the time was gone by with Alaric when such tricks of legerdemain\nwere convincing to him. A grave brow, compressed lips, and fixed eyes,\nhad no longer much effect upon him. He had a point to gain, and he was\nthinking of that, and not of Sir Gregory's grimaces.\n\n'Then you will not see the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the subject?'\n\n'No,' said Sir Gregory; 'it would be useless for me to do so. I could\nnot advocate such a scheme, feeling certain that it would be injurious\nboth to yourself and to the service; and I would not desire to see the\nChancellor with the view of opposing your wishes.'\n\n'I am much obliged to you for that, at any rate,' said Alaric.\n\n'But I do hope that you will not carry your plan any farther. When I\ntell you, as I do with the utmost sincerity, that I feel certain that an\nattempt to seat yourself in Parliament can only lead to the ruin of\nyour prospects as a Civil servant--prospects which are brighter now than\nthose of any other young man in the service--I cannot but think that you\nmust hesitate before you take any step which will, in my opinion, render\nyour resignation necessary.'\n\n'I shall be sorry to resign, Sir Gregory, as I have such true pleasure\nin serving with you.'\n\n'And, I presume, a salary of \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year is not unacceptable?' said\nSir Gregory, with the very faintest of smiles.\n\n'By no means,' said Alaric; 'I am a poor man, depending altogether on my\nown exertions for an income. I cannot afford to throw away a chance.'\n\n'Then take my word for it, you should give up all idea of Parliament,'\nsaid Sir Gregory, who thought that he had carried his point.\n\n'But I call a seat in Parliament a chance,' said Alaric; 'the best\nchance that a man, circumstanced as I am, can possibly have. I have the\noffer of a seat, Sir Gregory, and I can't afford to throw it away.'\n\n'Then it is my duty to tell you, as the head of your office, that it\nwill be your duty to resign before you offer yourself as a candidate.'\n\n'That you mean is your present opinion, Sir Gregory?'\n\n'Yes, Mr. Tudor, that is my opinion--an opinion which I shall be forced\nto express to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if you persist in this\ninfatuation.'\n\nAlaric looked very grave, but not a whit angry. 'I am sorry for it, Sir\nGregory, very sorry; I had hoped to have had your countenance.'\n\n'I would give it you, Mr. Tudor, if I could consistently with my duty as\na public servant; but as I cannot, I am sure you will not ask for it.'\nHow Fidus Neverbend would have admired the chief commissioner could he\nhave seen and heard him at this moment! 'But,' he continued, relaxing\nfor a while the muscles of his face, 'I hope, I do hope, you will think\nbetter of this. What are you to gain? Come, Tudor, think of it that way.\nWhat are you to gain? You, with a wife and young family coming up about\nyour heels, what are you to gain by going into Parliament? That is\nwhat I ask you. What are you to gain?' It was delightful to see how\npleasantly practical Sir Gregory could become when he chose to dismount\nfrom his high horse.\n\n'It is considered a high position in this country, that of a member of\nParliament,' said Alaric. 'A man in gaining that is generally supposed\nto have gained something.'\n\n'True, quite true. It is a desirable position for a rich man, or a rich\nman's eldest son, or even for a poor man, if by getting into Parliament\nhe can put himself in the way of improving his income. But, my dear\nTudor, you are in none of these positions. Abandon the idea, my dear\nTudor--pray abandon it. If not for your own sake, at any rate do so for\nthat of your wife and child.'\n\nSir Gregory might as well have whistled. Not a word that he said had the\nslightest effect on Alaric. How was it possible that his words should\nhave any effect, seeing that Alaric was convinced that Sir Gregory was\npleading for his own advantage, and not for that of his listener? Alaric\ndid listen. He received all that Sir Gregory said with the most profound\nattention; schooled his face into a look of the most polite deference;\nand then, with his most cruel tone, informed Sir Gregory that his mind\nwas quite made up, and that he did intend to submit himself to the\nelectors of Strathbogy.\n\n'And as to what you say about my seat at the board, Sir Gregory, you\nmay probably be right. Perhaps it will be as well that I should see the\nChancellor of the Exchequer myself.'\n\n'\"Who will to Cupar maun to Cupar,\"' said Sir Gregory; 'I can only\nsay, Mr. Tudor, that I am very sorry for you, and very sorry for your\nwife--very sorry, very sorry indeed.'\n\n'And who will to Strathbogy maun to Strathbogy,' said Alaric, laughing;\n'there is certainly an air of truth about the proverb as applied to\nmyself just at present. But the fact is, whether for good or for bad, I\nmaun to Strathbogy. That is my present destiny. The fact that I have\na wife and a child does make the step a most momentous one. But, Sir\nGregory, I should never forgive myself were I to throw away such an\nopportunity.'\n\n'Then I have nothing more to say, Mr. Tudor.'\n\n'Of course I shall try to save my place,' continued Alaric.\n\n'I look upon that as quite impossible,' said Sir Gregory.\n\n'It can do me no harm at any rate to see the Chancellor of the\nExchequer. If he tells me that a seat in Parliament and a seat at\nthe board are incompatible, and that as one of the Civil Service\nCommissioners I am not free to stand for the borough, I will in that\ncase, Sir Gregory, put my resignation in your hands before I publish my\naddress.'\n\nAnd so they parted, each determined to do all that in him lay to thwart\nthe wishes of the other. Alaric was not in the least influenced by\nanything that Sir Gregory had said to him; he had made up his mind, and\nwas determined to be turned from it by no arguments that his colleague\ncould use; but nevertheless he could not but be meditative, as, walking\nhome across the Parks, he thought of his wife and child. It is true that\nhe had a second trade; he was a stock-jobber as well as a Civil Service\nCommissioner; but he already perceived how very difficult it was to\nrealize an income to which he could trust from that second precarious\npursuit. He had also lived in a style considerably beyond that which his\nofficial income would have enabled him to assume. He had on the whole,\nhe thought, done very well; but yet it would be a dreadful thing to have\nto trust to so precarious a livelihood. He had realized nothing; he had\nnot yet been able to pay back the money which he had so fraudulently\ntaken, and to acquit himself of a debt which now lay daily heavier and\nheavier on his soul. He felt that he must repay not only that but Undy's\nshare also, before he could again pass a happy day or a quiet night.\nThis plan of throwing up \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year would badly assist him in getting\nrid of this incubus.\n\nBut still that watchword of his goaded him on--'Excelsior!' he still\nsaid to himself; 'Excelsior!' If he halted now, now when the ball was at\nhis foot, he might never have another chance. Very early in life before\na beard was on his chin, before he could style himself a man according\nto the laws of his country, he had determined within himself that a seat\nin Parliament was the only fitting ambition for an Englishman. That was\nnow within his reach. Would he be such a dastard as to draw back his\nhand, and be deterred from taking it, by old women's tales of prudence,\nand the self-interested lectures of Sir Gregory Hardlines?\n\n'Excelsior!' There was not much that could be so styled in that debt of\nhis to M. and Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe. If he could only pay that off he felt\nthat he could brave the world without a fear. Come what come might he\nwould sell out and do so. The bridge committee was sitting, and his\nshares were already worth more than he had paid for them. Mr. Blocks had\njust given his evidence, and the commercial world was willing enough to\ninvest in the Limehouse bridge. He would sell out and put his conscience\nat rest.\n\nBut then to do so successfully, he must induce Undy to do so too; and\nthat he knew would not at present be an easy task. Who had ever been\nsuccessful in getting back money from Undy Scott? He had paid the last\nhalf-year's interest with most commendable punctuality, and was not that\na great deal from Undy Scott?\n\nBut what if this appropriation of another's money, what if this fraud\nshould be detected and exposed before he had succeeded in paying back\nthe \u00c2\u00a310,000. What if he should wake some morning and find himself in the\ngrip of some Newgate myrmidon? A terrible new law had just been passed\nfor the protection of trust property; a law in which he had not felt the\nslightest interest when he had first seen in the daily newspapers some\ntedious account of the passing of the various clauses, but which was now\nterrible to his innermost thoughts.\n\nHis walk across the Parks was not made happy by much self-triumph. In\nspite of his commissionership and coming parliamentary honours, his\nsolitary moments were seldom very happy. It was at his club, when living\nwith Undy and Undy's peers, that he was best able to throw off his\ncares and enjoy himself. But even then, high as he was mounted on his\nfast-trotting horse, black Care would sit behind him, ever mounted on\nthe same steed.\n\nAnd bitterly did poor Gertrude feel the misery of these evenings which\nher husband passed at his club; but she never reviled him or complained;\nshe never spoke of her sorrow even to her mother or sister. She did not\neven blame him in her own heart. She knew that he had other business\nthan that of his office, higher hopes than those attached to his board;\nand she taught herself to believe that his career required him to be\namong public men.\n\nHe had endeavoured to induce her to associate constantly with Mrs. Val,\nso that her evenings might not be passed alone; but Gertrude, after\ntrying Mrs. Val for a time, had quietly repudiated the closeness of this\nalliance. Mrs. Val had her ideas of 'Excelsior,' her ambition to rule,\nand these ideas and this ambition did not at all suit Gertrude's temper.\nNot even for her husband's sake could she bring herself to be patronized\nby Mrs. Val. They were still very dear friends, of course; but they did\nnot live in each other's arms as Alaric had intended they should do.\n\nHe returned home after his interview with Sir Gregory, and found his\nwife in the drawing-room with her child. He usually went down from his\noffice to his club, and she was therefore the more ready to welcome him\nfor having broken through his habit on the present occasion.\n\nShe left her infant sprawling on the floor, and came up to greet him\nwith a kiss.\n\n'Ger,'--said he, putting his arm round her and embracing her--'I have\ncome home to consult you on business;' and then he seated himself on the\nsofa, taking her with him, and still in his arms. There was but little\ndoubt that she would consent to anything which he could propose to her\nafter such a fashion, in such a guise as this; that he knew full well.\n\n'Well, love,' said she, 'and what is the business about? You know that I\nalways think that to be best which you think to be best.'\n\n'Yes, Ger; but this is a very important matter;' and then he looked\ngrave, but managed at the same time to look happy and contented. 'This\nis a matter of vital importance to you, and I will do nothing in it\nwithout your consent.'\n\n'What is best for you must be best for me,' said Gertrude, kissing his\nforehead.\n\nThen he explained to her what had passed between himself and Sir\nGregory, and what his own ideas were as regarded the borough of\nStrathbogy. 'Sir Gregory,' said he, 'is determined that I shall not\nremain at the board and sit in Parliament at the same time; but I do not\nsee why Sir Gregory is to have his own way in everything. If you are not\nafraid of the risk, I will make up my mind to stand it at all events,\nand to resign if the Minister makes it imperative. If, however, you\nfear the result, I will let the matter drop, and tell the Scotts to find\nanother candidate. I am anxious to go into Parliament, I confess; but I\nwill never do so at the expense of your peace of mind.'\n\nThe way in which he put upon her the whole weight of the decision was\nnot generous. Nor was the mode he adopted of inducing her to back his\nown wishes. If there were risk to her--and in truth there was fearful\nrisk--it was his duty to guard her from the chance, not hers to say\nwhether such danger should be encountered or no. The nature of her\nanswer may be easily surmised. She was generous, though he was not.\nShe would never retard his advance, or be felt as a millstone round his\nneck. She encouraged him with all her enthusiasm, and bade him throw\nprudence to the winds. If he rose, must she not rise also? Whatever step\nin life was good for him, must it not be good for her as well? And so\nthat matter was settled between them--pleasantly enough.\n\nHe endured a fortnight of considerable excitement, during which he and\nSir Gregory did not smile at each other, and then he saw the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer. That gentleman promised to speak to the Prime\nMinister, feeling himself unable to answer the question put to him,\ndefinitely out of his own head; and then another fortnight passed on.\nAt the end of that time the Chancellor of the Exchequer sent for Alaric,\nand they had a second interview.\n\n'Well, Mr. Tudor,' said the great man, 'this is a matter of very\nconsiderable importance, and one on which I am not even yet prepared to\ngive you a positive answer.'\n\nThis was very good news for Alaric. Sir Gregory had spoken of the matter\nas one on which there could be no possible doubt. He had asserted that\nthe British lion would no longer sleep peaceably in his lair, if such\na violence were put on the constitution as that meditated by the young\ncommissioner. It was quite clear that the Chancellor of the Exchequer,\nand the Prime Minister also, looked at it in a very different light.\nThey doubted, and Alaric was well aware that their doubt was as good as\ncertainty to him.\n\nThe truth was that the Prime Minister had said to the Chancellor of the\nExchequer, in a half-serious, half-jocular way, that he didn't see why\nhe should reject a vote when offered to him by a member of the Civil\nService. The man must of course do his work--and should it be found that\nhis office work and his seat in Parliament interfered with each other,\nwhy, he must take the consequences. And if--or--or--made a row about it\nin the House and complained, why in that case also Mr. Tudor must take\nthe consequences. And then, enough having been said on that matter, the\nconversation dropped.\n\n'I am not prepared to give a positive answer,' said the Chancellor of\nthe Exchequer, who of course did not choose to commit himself.\n\nAlaric assured the great man that he was not so unreasonable as to\nexpect a positive answer. Positive answers, as he well knew, were not\noften forthcoming among official men; official men, as he had already\nlearnt, prefer to do their business by answers which are not positive.\nHe himself had become adverse to positive answers since he had become\na commissioner, and was quite prepared to dispense with them in the\nparliamentary career which he hoped that he was now about to commence.\nThis much, however, was quite clear, that he might offer himself as a\ncandidate to the electors of Strathbogy without resigning; and that Sir\nGregory's hostile remonstrance on the subject, should he choose to make\none, would not be received as absolute law by the greater powers.\n\nAccordingly as Alaric was elated, Sir Gregory was depressed. He had\nrisen high, but now this young tyro whom he had fostered was about to\nclimb above his head. O the ingratitude of men!\n\nAlaric, however, showed no triumph. He was more submissive, more\ngracious than ever to his chief. It was only to himself that he muttered\n'Excelsior!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nWESTMINSTER HALL\n\n\nThe parliamentary committee pursued their animated inquiries respecting\nthe Limehouse bridge all through the sultry month of July. How Mr. Vigil\nmust have hated Mr. Nogo, and the M'Carthy Desmond! how sick he must\nhave been of that eternal witness who, with imperturbable effrontery,\nanswered the 2,250 questions put to him without admitting anything! To\nMr. Vigil it was all mere nonsense, sheer waste of time. Had he been\ncondemned to sit for eight days in close contiguity to the clappers of\na small mill, he would have learnt as much as he did from the witnesses\nbefore the committee. Nevertheless he went through it and did not lose\nhis temper. He smiled sweetly on Mr. Nogo every morning, and greeted\nthe titled Irishman with his easy familiar nod, as though the continued\nsitting of this very committee was of all things to him the most\ndesirable. Such is Mr. Vigil's peculiar tact, such his special talent;\nthese are the gifts--gifts by no means ordinary--which have made him\nRight Honourable, and recommended him to the confidence of successive\nbadgers.\n\nBut though the committee was uninteresting to Mr. Vigil, it was not\nso to the speculative inhabitants of Limehouse, or to the credulous\nshopkeepers of Rotherhithe. On the evening of the day on which Mr.\nBlocks was examined, the shares went up 20 per cent; and when his\nevidence was published _in extenso_ the next Saturday morning by the\n_Capel Court Share-buyer_, a periodical which served for Bible and\nPrayer-book, as well as a Compendium of the Whole Duty of Man, to Undy\nScott and his friends, a further rise in the price of this now valuable\nproperty was the immediate consequence.\n\nNow, then, was the time for Alaric to sell and get out of his\ndifficulties if ever he could do so. Shares which he bought for 30s.\nwere now worth nearly \u00c2\u00a32 10s. He was strongly of opinion that they would\nfall again, and that the final result of the committee would leave\nthem of a less value than their original purchase-money, and probably\naltogether valueless. He could not, however, act in the matter without\nconsulting Undy, so closely linked were they in the speculation; and\neven at the present price his own shares would not enable him to pay\nback the full amount of what he had taken.\n\nThe joint property of the two was, however, at its present market price,\nworth \u00c2\u00a312,000--\u00c2\u00a310,000 would make him a free man. He was perfectly\nwilling to let Undy have the full use of the difference in amount; nay,\nhe was ready enough to give it to him altogether, if by so doing he\ncould place the whole of his ward's money once more in safety. With the\npower of offering such a douceur to his friend's rapacity, he flattered\nhimself that he might have a chance of being successful. He was thus\nprepared to discuss the matter with his partner.\n\nIt so happened that at the same moment Undy was desirous of discussing\nthe same subject, their joint interest, namely, in the Limehouse bridge;\nthere was no difficulty therefore in their coming together. They met\nat the door of the committee-room when Mr. Nogo had just put his 999th\nquestion to the adverse witness; and as the summons to prayers prevented\nthe 1,000th being proceeded with at that moment, Undy and Alaric\nsauntered back along the passages, and then walking up and down the\nimmense space of Westminster Hall, said each to the other what he had to\nsay on the matter mooted between them.\n\nUndy was in great glee, and seemed to look on his fortune as already\nmade. They had at first confined their remarks to the special evidence\nof the witness who had last been in the chair; and Undy, with the\nvolubility which was common to him when he was in high spirits, had\nbeen denouncing him as an ass who was injuring his own cause by his over\nobstinacy.\n\n'Nothing that he can say,' said Undy, 'will tell upon the share-market.\nThe stock is rising from hour to hour; and Piles himself told me that\nhe knew from sure intelligence that the Chancellor of the Exchequer\nis prepared to give way, whatever Vigil may say to the contrary. Their\nfirm, Piles says, is buying every share they can lay their hands on.'\n\n'Then in God's name let them buy ours,' said Alaric.\n\n'Buy ours!' said Undy. 'You don't mean to tell me that you wish to sell\nnow? You don't mean to say that you want to back out, now that the game\nis all going our own way?'\n\n'Indeed I do, and I intend to do so; just listen to me, Undy----'\n\n'I tell you fairly, Tudor, I will not sell a share; what you may choose\nto do with your own I cannot say. But if you will be guided by me you\nwill keep every share you have got. Instead of selling we should both\nadd to our stock. I at any rate am resolved to do so.'\n\n'Listen to me, Undy,' said Alaric.\n\n'The truth is,' said Undy--who at the present moment preferred talking\nto listening--'the truth is, you do not understand buying and selling\nshares. We should both be ruined very quickly were I to allow myself to\nbe led by you; you are too timid, too much afraid of risking your money;\nyour speculative pluck hardly rises higher than the Three per cents, and\nnever soars above a first-class mortgage on land.'\n\n'I could be as sanguine as you are, and as bold,' said Alaric, 'were I\nventuring with my own money.'\n\n'In the name of goodness get that bugbear out of your head,' said Undy.\n'Whatever good it might have done you to think of that some time ago,\nit can do you no good now.' There was a bitter truth in this which made\nAlaric's heart sink low within his breast. 'Wherever the money came\nfrom, whose property it may have been or be, it has been used; and now\nyour only safety is in making the best use of it. A little daring, a\nlittle audacity--it is that which ruins men. When you sit down to play\nbrag, you must brag it out, or lose your money.'\n\n'But, my dear fellow, there is no question here of losing money. If we\nsell now we shall realize about \u00c2\u00a32,000.'\n\n'And will that, or the half of that, satisfy you? Is that your idea of\na good thing? Will that be sufficient to pay for the dozen of bad things\nwhich a fellow is always putting his foot into? It won't satisfy me. I\ncan tell you that, at any rate.'\n\nAlaric felt very desirous of keeping Undy in a good humour. He wished,\nif possible, to persuade him rather than to drive him; to coax him into\nrepaying this money, and not absolutely to demand the repayment. 'Come,'\nsaid he, 'what do you call a good thing yourself?'\n\n'I call cent per cent a good thing, and I'll not sell a share till they\ncome up to that.'\n\n'They'll never do that, Undy.'\n\n'That's your opinion. I think differently. And I'm sure you will own I\nhave had more experience of the share-market than you have. When I see\nsuch men as Blocks and Piles buying fast, I know very well which way the\nwind blows. A man may be fishing a long time, Tudor, in these waters,\nbefore he gets such a haul as this; but he must be a great fool to let\ngo his net when he does get it.'\n\nThey both then remained silent for a time, for each was doubtful how\nbest to put forward the view which he himself wished to urge. Their\nprojects were diametrically different, and yet neither could carry his\nown without the assistance of the other.\n\n'I tell you what I propose,' said Undy.\n\n'Wait a moment, Undy,' said Alaric; 'listen to me for one moment. I can\nhear nothing till you do so, and then I will hear anything.'\n\n'Well, what is it?'\n\nWe have each of us put something near to \u00c2\u00a35,000 into this venture.'\n\n'I have put more,' said Scott.\n\n'Very well. But we have each of us withdrawn a sum equal to that I have\nnamed from my ward's fortune for this purpose.'\n\n'I deny that,' said Undy. 'I have taken nothing from your ward's\nfortune. I have had no power to do so. You have done as you pleased with\nthat fortune. But I am ready to admit that I have borrowed \u00c2\u00a35,000--not\nfrom your ward, but from you.'\n\nAlaric was nearly beside himself; but he still felt that he should have\nno chance of carrying his point if he lost his temper.\n\n'That is ungenerous of you, Scott, to say the least of it; but we'll let\nthat pass. To enable me to lend you the \u00c2\u00a35,000, and to enable me to join\nyou in this speculation, \u00c2\u00a310,000 has been withdrawn from Clementina's\nfortune.'\n\n'I know nothing about that,' said Scott.\n\n'Know nothing about it!' said Alaric, looking at him with withering\nscorn. But Undy was not made of withering material, and did not care a\nstraw for his friend's scorn.\n\n'Nothing whatever,' said he.\n\n'Well, so be it,' said Alaric; 'but the fact is, the money has been\nwithdrawn.'\n\n'I don't doubt that in the least,' said Undy. 'I am not now going to\nargue whether the fault has been most mine or yours,' continued Alaric.\n\n'Well, that is kind of you,' said Undy, 'considering that you are the\ngirl's trustee, and that I have no more to do with it than that fellow\nin the wig there.'\n\n'I wish at any rate you would let me explain myself,' said Alaric, who\nfelt that his patience was fast going, and who could hardly resist the\ntemptation of seizing his companion by the throat, and punishing him on\nthe spot for his iniquity.\n\n'I don't prevent you, my dear fellow--only remember this: I will not\npermit you to assert, without contradicting you, that I am responsible\nfor Clem's fortune. Now, go on, and explain away as hard as you like.'\n\nAlaric, under these circumstances, found it not very easy to put what\nhe had to say into any words that his companion would admit. He fully\nintended at some future day to thrust Scott's innocence down his throat,\nand tell him that he was not only a thief, but a mean, lying, beggarly\nthief. But the present was not the time. Too much depended on his\ninducing Undy to act with him.\n\n'Ten thousand pounds has at any rate been taken.'\n\n'That I won't deny.'\n\n'And half that sum has been lent to you.'\n\n'I acknowledge a debt of \u00c2\u00a35,000.'\n\n'It is imperative that \u00c2\u00a310,000 should at once be repaid.'\n\n'I have no objection in life.'\n\n'I can sell my shares in the Limehouse bridge,' continued Alaric, 'for\n\u00c2\u00a36,000, and I am prepared to do so.'\n\n'The more fool you,' said Undy,' if you do it; especially as \u00c2\u00a36,000\nwon't pay \u00c2\u00a310,000, and as the same property, if overheld another month\nor two, in all probability will do so.'\n\n'I am ready to sacrifice that and more than that,' said Alaric. 'If you\nwill sell out \u00c2\u00a34,000, and let me at once have that amount, so as to make\nup the full sum I owe, I will make you a free present of the remainder\nof the debt. Come, Undy, you cannot but call that a good thing. You will\nhave pocketed two thousand pounds, according to the present market value\nof the shares, and that without the slightest risk.'\n\nUndy for a while seemed staggered by the offer. Whether it was Alaric's\nextreme simplicity in making it, or his own good luck in receiving\nit, or whether by any possible chance some all but dormant remnant of\nfeeling within his heart was touched, we will not pretend to say. But\nfor a while he walked on silent, as though wavering in his resolution,\nand looking as if he wished to be somewhat more civil, somewhat less of\nthe bully, than he had been.\n\nThere was no one else to whom Alaric could dare to open his heart on\nthis subject of his ward's fortune; there was none other but this ally\nof his to whom he could confide, whom he could consult. Unpromising,\ntherefore, though Undy was as a confederate, Alaric, when he thought he\nsaw this change in his manner, poured forth at once the full tide of his\nfeelings.\n\n'Undy,' said he, 'pray bear with me a while. The truth is, I cannot\nendure this misery any longer. I do not now want to blame anyone but\nmyself. The thing has been done, and it is useless now to talk of blame.\nThe thing has been done, and all that now remains for me is to undo it;\nto put this girl's money back again, and get this horrid weight from off\nmy breast.'\n\n'Upon my word, my dear fellow, I did not think that you took it in such\na light as that,' said Undy.\n\n'I am miserable about it,' said Alaric. 'It keeps me awake all night,\nand destroys all my energy during the day.'\n\n'Oh, that's all bile,' said Undy. 'You should give up fish for a few\ndays, and take a blue pill at night.'\n\n'Scott, this money must be paid back at once, or I shall lose my senses.\nFortune has so far favoured me as to enable me to put my hand at once on\nthe larger portion of it. You must let me have the remainder. In God's\nname say that you will do so.'\n\nUndy Scott unfortunately had not the power to do as he was asked.\nWhether he would have done so, had he had the power, may be doubtful. He\nwas somewhat gravelled for an answer to Alaric's earnest supplication,\nand therefore made none till the request was repeated.\n\n'In God's name let me have this money,' repeated Alaric. 'You will then\nhave made two thousand pounds by the transaction.'\n\n'My dear Tudor,' said he, 'your stomach is out of order, I can see it as\nwell as possible from the way you talk.'\n\nHere was an answer for a man to get to the most earnest appeal which he\ncould make! Here was comfort for a wretch suffering from fear, remorse,\nand shame, as Alaric was suffering. He had spoken of his feelings and\nhis heart, but these were regions quite out of Undy Scott's cognizance.\n'Take a blue pill,' said he, 'and you'll be as right as a trivet in a\ncouple of days.'\n\nWhat was Alaric to say? What could he say to a man who at such a crisis\ncould talk to him of blue pills? For a while he said nothing; but the\nform of his face changed, a darkness came over his brow which Scott\nhad never before seen there, the colour flew from his face, his eyes\nsparkled, and a strange appearance of resolute defiance showed itself\nround his mouth. Scott began to perceive that his medical advice would\nnot be taken in good part.\n\n'Scott,' said he, stopping short in his walk and taking hold of the\ncollar of his companion's coat, not loosely by the button, but with\na firm grip which Undy felt that it would be difficult to shake\noff--'Scott, you will find that I am not to be trifled with. You have\nmade a villain of me. I can see no way to escape from my ruin without\nyour aid; but by the living God, if I fall, you shall fall with me. Tell\nme now; will you let me have the sum I demand? If you do not, I will go\nto your brother's wife and tell her what has become of her daughter's\nmoney.'\n\n'You may go to the devil's wife if you like it,' said Undy, 'and tell\nher whatever you please.'\n\n'You refuse, then?' said Alaric, still keeping hold of Undy's coat.\n\n'Come, take your hand off,' said Undy. 'You will make me think your head\nis wrong as well as your stomach, if you go on like this. Take your hand\noff and listen to me. I will then explain to you why I cannot do what\nyou would have me. Take your hand away, I say; do you not see that\npeople are looking at us.'\n\nThey were now standing at the upper end of the hall--close under the\nsteps which lead to the Houses of Parliament; and, as Undy said, the\nplace was too public for a display of physical resentment. Alaric took\nhis hand away. 'Well,' said he, 'now tell me what is to hinder you from\nletting me have the money you owe me?'\n\n'Only this,' said Undy, 'that every share I have in the concern is made\nover by way of security to old M'Cleury, and he now holds them. Till I\nhave redeemed them, I have no power of selling.'\n\nAlaric, when he heard these words, could hardly prevent himself from\nfalling in the middle of the hall. All his hopes were then over; he had\nno chance of shaking this intolerable burden from his shoulders; he\nhad taken the woman's money, this money which had been entrusted to his\nhonour and safe-keeping, and thrown it into a bottomless gulf.\n\n'And now listen to me,' said Undy, looking at his watch. 'I must be in\nthe House in ten or fifteen minutes, for this bill about married women\nis on, and I am interested in it: listen to me now for five minutes. All\nthis that you have been saying is sheer nonsense.'\n\n'I think you'll find that it is not all nonsense,' said Alaric.\n\n'Oh, I am not in the least afraid of your doing anything rash. You'll be\ncautious enough I know when you come to be cool; especially if you\ntake a little physic. What I want to say is this--Clem's money is\nsafe enough. I tell you these bridge shares will go on rising till the\nbeginning of next session. Instead of selling, what we should do is to\nbuy up six or seven thousand pounds more.'\n\n'What, with Clementina's money?'\n\n'It's as well to be hung for a sheep as a lamb. Besides, your doing so\nis your only safety. My brother Val insists upon having 250 shares.'\n\n'Your brother Val!' said Alaric.\n\n'Yes, Val; and why shouldn't he? I would give them to him if I could,\nbut I can't. M'Cleury, as I tell you, has every share of mine in his\npossession.'\n\n'Your brother Val wants 250 shares! And does he expect me to give them\nto him?'\n\n'Well--I rather think he does. That is, not to give them, of course; you\ndon't suppose he wants you to make him a present of money. But he wants\nyou to accommodate him with the price of them. You can either do that,\nor let him have so many of your own; it will be as broad as it is long;\nand he'll give you his note of hand for the amount.'\n\nNow it was well known among the acquaintance of the Scott family, that\nthe note of hand of the Honourable Captain Val was not worth the paper\non which it was written.\n\nAlaric was so astonished at this monstrous request, coming as it did\nafter such a conversation, that he did not well know how to take it.\n\nWas Undy mad, or was he in joke? What man in his senses would think of\nlending six or seven hundred pounds to Val Scott! 'I suppose you are in\njest,' said he, somewhat bitterly.\n\n'I never was more in earnest in my life,' said Undy. 'I'll just explain\nhow the matter is; and as you are sharp enough, you'll see at once that\nyou had better oblige him. Val, you know, is always hard up; he can't\ntouch a shilling of that woman's money, and just at present he has none\nof his own. So he came to me this morning to raise the wind.'\n\n'And you are kind enough to pass him on to me.'\n\n'Listen a moment. I did not do anything of the kind. I never lend money\nto Val. It's a principle with me not to do so, and he knows it.'\n\n'Then just tell him that my principles in this respect are identical\nwith your own.'\n\n'That's all very well; and you may tell him so yourself, if you like\nit; but hear first of all what his arguments are. Of course I told him I\ncould do nothing for him. 'But,' said he, 'you can get Tudor to do it.'\nI told him, of course, that I could do nothing of the kind. 'Oh!' said\nVal, 'I know the game you are both playing. I know all about Clem's\nmoney.' Val, you know, never says much. He was playing pool at the\ntime, at the club; but he came back after his stroke, and whispered to\nme--'You and Tudor must let me have 250 of those shares, and then it'll\nbe all right.' Now Val, you know, is a most determined fellow.\n\nAlaric, when he heard this, looked up into his companion's face to see\nwhether he was talking to the Evil One himself. Oh, what a net of ruin\nwas closing round him!--how inextricable were the toils into which he\nhad fallen!\n\n'After all,' continued Undy,' what he asks is not much, and I really\nthink you should do it for him. He is quite willing to give you his\nassistance at Strathbogy, and he is entitled to some accommodation.'\n\n'Some accommodation!' repeated Alaric, almost lost in the consideration\nof his own misery.\n\n'Yes; I really think he is. And, Tudor, you may be sure of this, you\nknow; you will be quite safe with him. Val is the very soul of honour.\nDo this for him, and you'll hear no more about it. You may be quite sure\nhe'll ask for nothing further, and that he'll never say a word to annoy\nyou. He's devilish honourable is Val; no man can be more so; though,\nperhaps, you wouldn't think it.'\n\n'Devilish honourable!' said Alaric. 'Only he would like to have a\nbribe.'\n\n'A bribe!' said Scott. 'Come, my dear fellow, don't you make an ass of\nyourself. Val is like the rest of us; when money is going, he likes to\nhave a share of it. If you come to that, every man who is paid either\nfor talking or for not talking is bribed.'\n\n'I don't know that I ever heard of a much clearer case of a bribe than\nthis which you now demand for your brother.'\n\n'Bribe or no bribe,' said Undy, looking at his watch, 'I strongly advise\nyou to do for him what he asks; it will be better for all of us. And let\nme give you another piece of advice: never use hard words among friends.\nDo you remember the Mary Janes which Manylodes brought for you in his\npocket to the hotel at Tavistock?' Here Alaric turned as pale as a\nspectre. 'Don't talk of bribes, my dear fellow. We are all of us giving\nand taking bribes from our cradles to our graves; but men of the world\ngenerally call them by some prettier names. Now, if you are not desirous\nto throw your cards up altogether, get these shares for Val, and let him\nor me have them to-morrow morning.' And so saying Undy disappeared into\nthe House, through the side door out of the hall, which is appropriated\nto the use of honourable members.\n\nAnd then Alaric was left alone. He had never hitherto realized the true\nfacts of the position in which he had placed himself; but now he did so.\nHe was in the hands of these men, these miscreants, these devils; he was\ncompletely at their mercy, and he already felt that they were as devoid\nof mercy as they were of justice. A cold sweat broke out all over him,\nand he continued walking up and down the hall, ignorant as to where he\nwas and what he was doing, almost thoughtless, stunned, as it were, by\nhis misery and the conviction that he was a ruined man. He had remained\nthere an hour after Undy had left him, before he roused himself\nsufficiently to leave the hall and think of returning home. It was then\nseven o'clock, and he remembered that he had asked his cousin to dine\nwith him. He got into a cab, therefore, and desired to be driven home.\n\nWhat was he to do? On one point he instantly made up his mind. He would\nnot give one shilling to Captain Val; he would not advance another\nshilling to Undy; and he would at once sell out his own shares, and make\nsuch immediate restitution as might now be in his power. The mention\nof Manylodes and the mining shares had come home to him with frightful\nreality, and nearly stunned him. What right, indeed, had he to talk of\nbribes with scorn--he who so early in his own life had allowed himself\nto be bought? How could he condemn the itching palm of such a one as Val\nScott--he who had been so ready to open his own when he had been tempted\nby no want, by no poverty?\n\nHe would give nothing to Captain Val to bribe him to silence. He knew\nthat if he did so, he would be a slave for ever. The appetite of such a\nshark as that, when once he has tasted blood, is unappeasable. There is\nnothing so ruinous as buying the silence of a rogue who has a secret.\n\nWhat you buy you never possess; and the price that is once paid must\nbe repaid again and again, as often as the rogue may demand it. Any\nalternative must be better than this.\n\nAnd yet what other alternative was there? He did not doubt that Val,\nwhen disappointed of his prey, would reveal whatever he might know to\nhis wife, or to his stepson. Then there would be nothing for Alaric but\nconfession and ruin. And how could he believe what Undy Scott had told\nhim? Who else could have given information against him but Undy himself?\nWho else could have put up so heavily stupid a man as Captain Scott to\nmake such a demand? Was it not clear that his own colleague, his own\npartner, his own intimate associate, Undy Scott himself, was positively\nworking out his ruin? Where were now his high hopes, where now his seat\nin Parliament, his authority at the board, his proud name, his soaring\nambition, his constant watchword? 'Excelsior'--ah me--no! no longer\n'Excelsior'; but he thought of the cells of Newgate, of convict prisons,\nand then of his young wife and of his baby.\n\nHe made an effort to assume his ordinary demeanour, and partially\nsucceeded. He went at once up to his drawing-room, and there he found\nCharley and Gertrude waiting dinner for him; luckily he had no other\nguests.\n\n'Are you ill, Alaric?' said Gertrude, directly she saw him.\n\n'Ill! No,' said he; 'only fagged, dearest; fagged and worried, and\nbadgered and bored; but, thank God, not ill;' and he endeavoured to put\non his usual face, and speak in his usual tone. 'I have kept you waiting\nmost unmercifully for your dinner, Charley; but then I know you navvies\nalways lunch on mutton chops.'\n\n'Oh, I am not particularly in a hurry,' said Charley; 'but I deny the\nlunch. This has been a bad season for mutton chops in the neighbourhood\nof Somerset House; somehow they have not grown this year.'\n\nAlaric ran up to prepare for dinner, and his wife followed him.\n\n'Oh! Alaric,' said she, 'you are so pale: what is the matter? Do tell\nme,' and she put her arm through his, took hold of his hand, and looked\nup into his face.\n\n'The matter! Nothing is the matter--a man can't always be grinning;'\nand he gently shook her off, and walked through their bedroom to his\nown dressing-room. Having entered it he shut the door, and then, sitting\ndown, bowed his head upon a small table and buried it in his hands. All\nthe world seemed to go round and round with him; he was giddy, and he\nfelt that he could not stand.\n\nGertrude paused a moment in the bedroom to consider, and then followed\nhim. 'What is it you want?' said he, as soon as he heard the handle\nturn, 'do leave me alone for one moment. I am fagged with the heat, and\nI want one minute's rest.'\n\n'Oh, Alaric, I see you are ill,' said she. 'For God's sake do not send\nme from you,' and coming into the room she knelt down beside his chair.\n'I know you are suffering, Alaric; do let me do something for you.'\n\nHe longed to tell her everything. He panted to share his sorrows with\none other bosom; to have one near him to whom he could speak openly of\neverything, to have one counsellor in his trouble. In that moment he all\nbut resolved to disclose everything to her, but at last he found that he\ncould not do it. Charley was there waiting for his dinner; and were he\nnow to tell his secret to his wife, neither of them, neither he nor she,\nwould be able to act the host or hostess. If done at all, it could not\nat any rate be done at the present moment.\n\n'I am better now,' said he, giving a long and deep sigh; and then he\nthrew his arms round his wife and passionately embraced her. 'My own\nangel, my best, best love, how much too good or much too noble you are\nfor such a husband as I am!'\n\n'I wish I could be good enough for you,' she replied, as she began to\narrange his things for dressing. 'You are so tired, dearest; wash your\nhands and come down--don't trouble yourself to dress this evening;\nunless, indeed, you are going out again.'\n\n'Gertrude,' said he, 'if there be a soul on earth that has not in it a\nspark of what is good or generous, it is the soul of Undy Scott;' and so\nsaying he began the operations of his toilet.\n\nNow Gertrude had never liked Undy Scott; she had attributed to him\nwhatever faults her husband might have as a husband; and at the present\nmoment she was not inclined to fight for any of the Scott family.\n\n'He is a very worldly man, I think,' said she.\n\n'Worldly!--no--but hellish,' said Alaric; 'hellish, and damnable, and\nfiendish.'\n\n'Oh, Alaric, what has he done?'\n\n'Never mind; I cannot tell you; he has done nothing. It is not that he\nhas done anything, or can do anything to me--but his heart--but never\nmind--I wish--I wish I had never seen him.'\n\n'Alaric, if it be about money tell me the worst, and I'll bear it\nwithout a murmur. As long as you are well I care for nothing else--have\nyou given up your place?'\n\n'No, dearest, no; I can keep my place. It is nothing about that. I have\nlost no money; I have rather made money. It is the ingratitude of\nthat man which almost kills me. But come, dearest, we will go down to\nCharley. And Gertrude, mind this, be quite civil to Mrs. Val at present.\nWe will break from the whole set before long; but in the meantime I\nwould have you be very civil to Mrs. Val.'\n\nAnd so they went down to dinner, and Alaric, after taking a glass of\nwine, played his part almost as though he had no weight upon his soul.\nAfter dinner he drank freely, and as he drank his courage rose. 'Why\nshould I tell her?' he said to himself as he went to bed. 'The chances\nare that all will yet go well.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nMRS. VAL'S NEW CARRIAGE\n\n\nOn the next morning Alaric went to his office without speaking further\nas to the trouble on his mind, and endeavoured to comfort himself as\nbest he might as he walked down to his office. Then he had also to\ndecide whether it would better suit his purpose to sell out at once and\npay up every shilling that he could, or whether he would hold on, and\nhope that Undy's predictions would be fulfilled, and that the bridge\nshares would go on rising till they would sell for all that was required\nof him.\n\nUnfortunate man! what would he have given now to change his position for\nNorman's single clerkship, or even for Charley's comparative poverty!\n\nGertrude stayed within all day; but not all day in solitude. About\nfour in the afternoon the Hon. Mrs. Val called, and with her came her\ndaughter Clem, now Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe, and the two Misses Neverbend. M.\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe had since his marriage made himself very agreeable to his\nhonourable mother-in-law, so much so that he now occupied the place in\nher good graces which Undy had formerly filled, and which after Undy's\nreign had fallen to Alaric's lot. Mrs. Val liked to have about her\nsome confidential gentleman; and as she never thought of placing her\nconfidence in her husband, she was prone to select first one man and\nthen another as her taste and interest dictated. Immediately after their\nmarriage, Victoire and Clem had consented to join housekeeping with\ntheir parent. Nothing could be more pleasant than this; their income was\nunembarrassed, and Mrs. Val, for the first time in her life, was able\nto set up her carriage. Among the effects arising from this cause, the\nfemale Neverbends, who had lately been worshippers of Gertrude, veered\nround in their idolatry, and paid their vows before Mrs. Val's new\nyellow panels. In this new carriage now came the four ladies to pay\na morning visit to Mrs. Tudor. It was wonderful to see into how small\ndimensions the Misses Neverbend had contrived to pack, not themselves,\nbut their crinoline.\n\nAs has before been hinted, Gertrude did not love Mrs. Val; nor did she\nlove Clem the danseuse; nor did she specially love the Misses Neverbend.\nThey were all of a class essentially different from that in which she\nhad been brought up; and, moreover, Mrs. Val was not content to\nallow Gertrude into her set without ruling over her, or at any rate\npatronizing her. Gertrude had borne with them all for her husband's\nsake; and was contented to do so yet for a while longer, but she thought\nin her heart that she would be able to draw some consolation from her\nhusband's misfortune if it should be the means of freeing her from Mrs.\nVal.\n\n'Oh, my dear,' said Mrs. Val, throwing herself down into a sofa as\nthough she were exhausted--'what a dreadful journey it is to you up\nhere! How those poor horses will stand it this weather I don't know, but\nit nearly kills me; it does indeed.' The Tudors, as has been said, lived\nin one of the quiet streets of Westbournia, not exactly looking into\nHyde Park, but very near to it; Mrs. Val, on the other hand, lived\nin Ebury Street, Pimlico; her house was much inferior to that of the\nTudors; it was small, ill built, and afflicted with all the evils which\nbad drainage and bad ventilation can produce; but then it was reckoned\nto be within the precincts of Belgravia, and was only five minutes'\nwalk from Buckingham Palace. Mrs. Val, therefore, had fair ground for\ntwitting her dear friend with living so far away from the limits of\nfashion. 'You really must come down somewhat nearer to the world; indeed\nyou must, my dear,' said the Hon. Mrs. Val.\n\n'We are thinking of moving; but then we are talking of going to St.\nJohn's Wood, or Islington,' said Gertrude, wickedly.\n\n'Islington!' said the Honourable Mrs. Val, nearly fainting.\n\n'Is not Islington and St. Giles' the same place?' asked the innocent\nClem, with some malice, however, to counterbalance her innocence.\n\n'O no!' said Lactimel. 'St Giles' is where the poor wretched starving\nIrish dwell. Their utter misery in the middle of this rich metropolis is\na crying disgrace to the Prime Minister.' Poor Badger, how much he has\nto bear! 'Only think,' continued Lactimel, with a soft pathetic drawl,\n'they have none to feed them, none to clothe them, none to do for them!'\n\n'It is a great question,' said Ugolina, 'whether promiscuous charity is\na blessing or a curse. It is probably the greatest question of the age.\nI myself am inclined to think--'\n\n'But, ma,' said Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe, 'Mrs. Tudor doesn't really mean that\nshe is going to live at St. Giles', does she?'\n\n'I said Islington,' said Gertrude. 'We may go to St. Giles' next,\nperhaps.' Had she known all, how dreadful would such jokes have been to\nher!\n\nMrs. Val saw that she was being quizzed, and, not liking it, changed the\nconversation. 'Ugolina,' said she, 'might I trouble you to look out of\nthe front window? I hope those stupid men of mine are not letting the\nhorses stand still. They were so warm coming here, that they will be\nsure to catch cold.' The stupid men, however, were round the corner at\nthe public-house, and Ugolina could only report that as she did not see\nthem she supposed the horses were walking about.\n\n'And so,' said Mrs. Val, 'Mr. Tudor is thinking of resigning his place\nat the Civil Service Board, and standing for that borough of Lord\nGaberlunzie's, in Aberdeenshire?'\n\n'I really cannot say,' said Gertrude; 'but I believe he has some idea\nof going into Parliament. I rather believe he will continue to hold his\nplace.'\n\n'Oh, that I know to be impossible! I was told that by a gentleman who\nhas been much longer in the service than Mr. Tudor, and who understands\nall its bearings.' She here alluded to Fidus Neverbend.\n\n'I cannot say,' said Gertrude. 'I do not think Mr. Tudor has quite made\nup his mind yet.'\n\n'Well, my dear, I'll tell you fairly what I think about it. You know the\nregard I have for you and Mr. Tudor. He, too, is Clementina's trustee;\nthat is to say, her fortune is partly consigned to his care; so I cannot\nbut have a very great interest about him, and be very anxious that he\nshould do well. Now, my dear, I'll tell you fairly what I think, and\nwhat all the world is saying. He ought not to think of Parliament. He\nought not, indeed, my dear. I speak for your sake, and your child's. He\nis not a man of fortune, and he ought not to think of Parliament. He has\na very fine situation, and he really should be contented.'\n\nThis was intolerable to Gertrude. She felt that she must put Mrs. Val\ndown, and yet she hardly knew how to do it without being absolutely\nrude; whereas her husband had specially begged her to be civil to this\nwoman at present. 'Oh,' said she, with a slight smile, 'Mr. Tudor will\nbe able to take care of himself; you will find, I hope, that there is no\ncause for uneasiness.'\n\n'Well, I hope not, I am sure I hope not,' said Mrs. Val, looking very\ngrave. 'But I tell you fairly that the confidence which we all have in\nyour husband will be much shaken if he does anything rash. He should\nthink of this, you know. He has no private fortune to back him; we must\nremember that.'\n\nGertrude became very red in the face; but she would not trust herself to\nanswer Mrs. Val at the spur of the moment.\n\n'It makes such a difference, when one has got no private fortune,' said\nMadame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe, the heiress. 'Does it not, Lactimel?'\n\n'Oh, indeed it does,' said Lactimel. 'I wish every one had a private\nfortune; it would be so nice, wouldn't it?'\n\n'There would be very little poetry in the world if you were to banish\npoverty,' said Ugolina. 'Poverty may be called the parent of poetry.\nLook at Milton, how poor he was; and Homer, he begged his bread.'\n\n'But Lord Byron was not a beggar,' said Clem, contemptuously.\n\n'I do hope Mr. Tudor will think of what he is doing,' continued Mrs.\nVal. 'It is certainly most good-natured and most disinterested of\nmy dear father-in-law, Lord Gaberlunzie, to place his borough at Mr.\nTudor's disposal. It is just like him, dear good old nobleman. But, my\ndear, it will be a thousand pities if Mr. Tudor should be led on by his\nlordship's kindness to bring about his own ruin.'\n\nMrs. Val had once in her life seen his good-natured lordship. Soon after\nher marriage she had insisted on Captain Val taking her down to the\nfamily mansion. She stayed there one night, and then left it, and since\nthat had shown no further desire to visit Cauldkail Castle. She did not\nthe less delight to talk about her dear good father-in-law, the lord.\nWhy should she give his son Val board and lodging, but that she might be\nenabled to do so? She was not the woman to buy an article, and not make\nof it all the use of which it might be capable.\n\n'Pray do not concern yourself,' said Gertrude. 'I can assure you Mr.\nTudor will manage very well for himself--but should any misfortune\nhappen to him he will not, you may be certain, attribute it to Lord\nGaberlunzie.'\n\n'I am told that Sir Gregory is most opposed to it,' continued Mrs. Val.\n'I heard that from Mr. Neverbend, who is altogether in Sir Gregory's\nconfidence--did not you, my dears?' and she turned round to the sisters\nof Fidus for confirmation.\n\n'I heard my brother say that as Mr. Tudor's office is not parliamentary\nbut permanent, and as he has to attend from ten till four----'\n\n'Alaric has not to attend from ten till four,' said Gertrude, who\ncould not endure the idea that her husband should be ranked with common\nclerks, like Fidus Neverbend.\n\n'Oh, I didn't know,' said Lactimel, meekly. 'Perhaps Fidus only meant\nthat as it is one of those offices where the people have something to\ndo, the commissioners couldn't be in their offices and in Parliament at\nthe same time.'\n\n'I did understand,' said Ugolina, 'that Sir Gregory Hardlines had put\nhis veto upon it; but I must confess that it is a subject which I have\nnot sufficiently studied to enable me----'\n\n'It's \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year, isn't it?' asked the bride.\n\n'Twelve hundred pounds a year,' said her mother--'a very serious\nconsideration when there is no private fortune to back it, on either\nside. Now if it were Victoire----'\n\n'He couldn't sit in Parliament, ma, because he's an alien--only for that\nI shouldn't think of his doing anything else.'\n\n'Perhaps that may be altered before long,' said Lactimel, graciously.\n\n'If Jews are to be admitted,' said Ugolina, 'who certainly belong to\nan alien nation; a nation expressly set apart and separated from all\npeople--a peculiar nation distinct from all others, I for one cannot\ndiscern----'\n\nWhat Ugolina could or could not discern about the Jews was communicated\nperhaps to Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe or to Lactimel, but not to Gertrude or to\nMrs. Val; for the latter, taking Gertrude apart into a corner as it were\nof the sofa, began confidentially to repeat to her her fears about her\nhusband.\n\n'I see, my dear,' said she, 'that you don't like my speaking about it.'\n\n'Upon my word,' said Gertrude, 'I am very indifferent about it. But\nwould it not be better if you said what you have to say to my husband?'\n\n'I intend to do so. I intend to do that also. But I know that a wife\nought to have influence over her husband, and I believe that you have\ninfluence over yours.'\n\n'Not the least,' said Gertrude, who was determined to contradict Mrs.\nVal in everything.\n\n'I am sorry to hear it,' said Mrs. Val, who among all her excellent\nacquirements, did not possess that specially excellent one of\nunderstanding repartee. 'I am very sorry to hear it, and I shall\ncertainly speak to him the more seriously on that account. I think I\nhave some influence over him; at any rate I ought to have.'\n\n'I dare say you have,' said Gertrude; 'Alaric always says that no\nexperience is worth anything that is not obtained by years.'\n\nMrs. Val at least understood this, and continued her lecture with some\nadditional severity. 'Well, my dear, I am glad he has so much wisdom.\nBut what I was going to say is this: you know how much we have at stake\nwith Mr. Tudor--what a very large sum of Clementina's money lies in his\nhands. Now I really should not have consented to the arrangement had I\nthought it possible that Mr. Tudor would have given up his income\nwith the idea of going into Parliament. It wouldn't have been right or\nprudent of me to do so. I have the greatest opinion of your husband's\ntalents and judgement, or I should not of course have entrusted him\nwith the management of Clementina's fortune; but I really shall think it\nright to make some change if this project of his goes on.'\n\n'Why, what is it you suspect?' said Gertrude. 'Do you think that Mr.\nTudor intends to use your daughter's income if he loses a portion of his\nown? I never heard such a thing in my life.'\n\n'Hush! my dear--gently--I would not for worlds let Clementina hear a\nword of this; it might disturb her young happiness. She is so charmed\nwith her husband; her married life is so fortunate; Victoire is\nso--so--so everything that we all wish, that I would not for the world\nbreathe in her hearing a shadow of a suspicion.'\n\n'Good gracious! Mrs. Scott, what do you mean? Suspicion!--what\nsuspicion? Do you suspect my husband of robbing you?' Oh, Gertrude; poor\nGertrude! she was doomed to know it all before long.\n\n'Oh dear, no,' said Mrs. Val; 'nothing of the kind, I assure you. Of\ncourse we suspect nothing of the sort. But one does like to have one's\nmoney in safe hands. Of course Mr. Tudor wouldn't have been chosen as\ntrustee if he hadn't had a good income of his own; and look here, my\ndear,'--and Mrs. Val whispered very confidentially--'Mr. Tudor we all\nknow is greatly concerned in this bridge that the committee is sitting\nabout; and he and my brother-in-law, Undecimus, are always dealing in\nshares. Gentlemen do, I know; and therefore I don't say that there is\nanything against it. But considering all, I hope Mr. Tudor won't take it\nill if we propose to change our trustee.'\n\n'I am very certain he will not,' said Gertrude. 'It is a laborious\nbusiness, and he will be glad enough to be rid of it. When he was\nasked to accept it, he thought it would be ill-natured to refuse; I am\ncertain, however, he will be very glad to give up the work to any other\nperson who may be appointed. I will be sure to tell him this evening\nwhat you have said.'\n\n'You need not trouble yourself to do that,' said Mrs. Val. 'I shall see\nhim myself before long.'\n\n'It will be no trouble,' said Gertrude, very indignantly, for she was\nvery angry, and had, as she thought, great cause for anger. 'I shall\ncertainly think it my duty to do so after what has passed. Of course you\nwill now take steps to relieve him as soon as possible.'\n\n'You have taken me up a great deal too quick, my dear,' said Mrs. Val.\n'I did not intend----'\n\n'Oh--one can't be too quick on such a matter as this,' said Gertrude.\n'When confidence is once lost between two persons it is better that the\nconnexion which has grown out of confidence should be put an end to as\nsoon as possible.'\n\n'Lost confidence! I said nothing about lost confidence!'\n\n'Alaric will so understand it, I am quite sure; at any rate I will tell\nhim what you have said. Suspicion indeed! who has dared to suspect him\nof anything not honest or upright?'\n\nGertrude's eyes flashed with anger as she vindicated her absent lord.\nMrs. Val had been speaking with bated breath, so that no one had heard\nher but she to whom she was speaking; but Gertrude had been unable so to\nconfine her answers, and as she made her last reply Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe\nand the Misses Neverbend were all ears.\n\n'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Mrs. Val. 'Upon my word, my dear, it is amusing to\nhear you take it up. However, I assure you I meant nothing but what was\nkind and friendly. Come, Clementina, we have been sitting here a\nmost unconscionable time. Will you allow me, my dear, to ring for my\ncarriage?'\n\n'Mamma,' said Clem, 'have you asked Mrs. Tudor to our little dance?'\n\n'No, my dear; I have left that for you to do. It's your party, you\nknow--but I sincerely hope Mrs. Tudor will come.'\n\n'Oh yes,' said Clementina, the tongue of whose eloquence was now\nloosened. 'You must come, Mrs. Tudor; indeed you must. It will be so\ncharming; just a few nice people, you know, and nothing more.'\n\n'Thank you,' said Gertrude; 'but I never dance now.' She had inwardly\nresolved that nothing should ever induce her again to enter Mrs. Val's\nhouse.\n\n'Oh, but you must come,' said Clementina. 'It will be so charming. We\nonly mean to dance one kind of dance--that new thing they have just\nbrought over from Spain--the Contrabandista. It is a polka step, only\nvery quick, and you take every other turn by yourself; so you have to\ntake your partner up and let him go as quick as possible. You don't\nknow how charming it is, and it will be all the rage. We are to have the\nmusic out in the street, just as they have in Spain.'\n\n'It would be much too difficult for me,' said Gertrude.\n\n'It is difficult,' said the enthusiastic Clem; 'but Victoire gives us\nlessons in it everyday from twelve to two--doesn't he, Ugolina?'\n\n'I'm afraid I shouldn't have time to go to school,' said Gertrude.\n\n'Oh, it doesn't take much time--six or seven or eight lessons will do it\npretty well. I have almost learnt it already, and Ugolina is coming on\nvery fast. Lactimel is not quite so perfect. She has learnt the step,\nbut she cannot bring herself to let Victoire go quick enough. Do come,\nand bring Mr. Tudor with you.'\n\n'As he has not to attend from ten till four, he could come and take\nlessons too,' said Lactimel, who, now that she was no longer a hanger-on\nof Gertrude's, could afford to have her little revenge.\n\n'That would be delightful,' said Clem. 'Mr. Charles Tudor does come in\nsometimes at twelve o'clock, and I think he does it almost as well as\nVictoire.'\n\nGertrude, however, would go neither to the rehearsals nor to the\nfinished performance; and as Mrs. Val's men had by this time been\ninduced to leave the beershop, the whole party went away, leaving\nGertrude to her meditations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nTICKLISH STOCK\n\n\nAlaric returned from his office worn and almost as wretched as he had\nbeen on the day before. He had spent a miserable day. In the morning Sir\nGregory had asked him whether he had finally made up his mind to address\nthe electors of Strathbogy. 'No, not finally,' said Alaric, 'but I think\nI shall do so.'\n\n'Then I must tell you, Tudor,' said Sir Gregory, speaking more in sorrow\nthan in anger, 'that you will not have my countenance. I cannot but\nthink also that you are behaving with ingratitude.' Alaric prepared to\nmake some petulant answer, but Sir Gregory, in the meantime, left the\nroom.\n\nEvery one was falling away from him. He felt inclined to rush after Sir\nGregory, and promise to be guided in this matter solely by him, but his\npride prevented him: though he was no longer sanguine and confident as\nhe had been a week ago, still his ambition was high. 'Those who play\nbrag must brag it out, or they will lose their money.' This had been\nsaid by Undy; but it was not the less true on that account. Alaric felt\nthat he was playing brag, and that his only game was to brag it out.\n\nHe walked home slowly through the Parks. His office and house were so\ncircumstanced that, though they were some two miles distant, he could\nwalk from one to the other almost without taking his feet off the grass.\nThis had been the cause of great enjoyment to him; but now he sauntered\non with his hands behind his back, staring straight before him, with\nfixed eyes, going by his accustomed route, but never thinking for a\nmoment where he was. The time was gone when he could watch the gambols\nof children, smile at the courtships of nursery-maids, watch the changes\nin the dark foliage of the trees, and bend from his direct path hither\nand thither to catch the effects of distant buildings, and make for his\neye half-rural landscapes in the middle of the metropolis. No\nlandscapes had beauty for him now; the gambols even of his own baby were\nunattractive to him; leaves might bud forth and nourish and fall without\nhis notice. How went the share-market? that was the only question that\nhad an interest for him. The dallyings of Capel Court were the only\ncourtships that he now cared to watch.\n\nAnd with what a terribly eager eye had he now to watch them! If his\nshares went up quickly, at once, with an unprecedented success, he might\npossibly be saved. That was all. But if they did not--! Such was the\nphase of life under which at the present moment it behoved him to exist.\n\nAnd then, when he reached his home, how was he welcomed? With all the\nfond love which a loving wife can show; so much at least was his;\nbut before he had felt the sweetness of her caresses, before he had\nacknowledged how great was the treasure that he possessed, forth from\nher eager lips had come the whole tale of Mrs. Val's impertinence.\n\n'I will never see her again, Alaric! never; she talked of her daughter's\nmoney, and said something of suspicion!' Suspicion! Gertrude's eye again\nflashed fire with anger; and she all but stamped with her little foot\nupon the ground. Suspicion! suspect him, her husband, the choice of her\nheart, her Alaric, the human god whom she worshipped! suspect him of\nrobbery! her lord, her heart, her soul, the strong staff on which she\nleaned so securely, with such true feminine confidence! Suspect him of\ncommon vile dishonesty!--'You will never ask me to see her again--will\nyou, Alaric?'\n\nWhat was he to say to her? how was he to bear this? His heart yearned\nto tell her all; he longed for the luxury of having one bosom to whom\nhe could entrust his misery, his slight remaining hope. But how could he\nhimself, at one blow, by one word, destroy the high and polished shaft\non which she whom he loved had placed him? He could not do it. He would\nsuffer by himself; hope by himself, cease to hope by himself, and endure\nall, till either his sufferings or his hopes should be over.\n\nHe had to pretend that he was indignant at Mrs. Val's interference; he\nhad to counterfeit the feelings of outraged honour, which was so natural\nto Gertrude. This he failed to do well. Had he been truly honest--had\nthat woman's suspicion really done him injustice--he would have received\nhis wife's tidings with grave displeasure, and have simply resolved to\nacquit himself as soon as possible of the disagreeable trust which had\nbeen reposed in him. But such was not now his conduct. He contented\nhimself by calling Mrs. Val names, and pretended to laugh at her\ndispleasure.\n\n'But you will give up this trust, won't you?' said Gertrude.\n\n'I will think about it,' said he. 'Before I do anything I must consult\nold Figgs. Things of that kind can't be put out of their course by the\nspleen of an old woman like Mrs. Val.'\n\n'Oh, Alaric, I do so wish you had had nothing to do with these Scotts!'\n\n'So do I,' said he, bitterly; 'I hate them--but, Gertrude, don't talk\nabout them now; my head aches, and I am tired.'\n\nHe sat at home the whole evening; and though he was by no means gay, and\nhardly affectionate in his demeanour to her, yet she could not but feel\nthat some good effect had sprung from his recent dislike to the Scotts,\nsince it kept him at home with her. Lately he had generally spent his\nevenings at his club. She longed to speak to him of his future career,\nof his proposed seat in Parliament, of his office-work; but he gave her\nno encouragement to speak of such things, and, as he pleaded that he was\nill, she left him in quiet on the sofa.\n\nOn the next morning he again went to his office, and in the course of\nthe morning a note was brought to him from Undy. It ran as follows:--\n\n'MY DEAR TUDOR,\n\n'Is Val to have the shares? Let me have a line by the bearer.\n\n'Yours ever,\n\n'U. S.'\n\nTo this he replied by making an appointment to meet Undy before dinner\nat his own office.\n\nAt the time fixed Undy came, and was shown by the sole remaining\nmessenger into Alaric's private room. The two shook hands together in\ntheir accustomed way. Undy smiled good-humouredly, as he always did; and\nAlaric maintained his usual composed and uncommunicative look.\n\n'Well,' said Undy, sitting down, 'how about those shares?'\n\n'I am glad you have come,' said Alaric, 'because I want to speak to you\nwith some earnestness.'\n\n'I am quite in earnest myself,' said Undy; 'and so, by G--, is Val. I\nnever saw a fellow more in earnest--nor yet apparently more hard up. I\nhope you have the shares ready, or else a cheque for the amount.'\n\n'Look here, Undy; if my doing this were the only means of saving both\nyou and me from rotting in gaol, by the Creator that made me I would not\ndo it!'\n\n'I don't know that it will have much effect upon me, one way or the\nother,' said Undy, coolly; 'but it seems to me to be the only way that\ncan save yourself from some such fate. Shall I tell you what the clauses\nare of this new bill about trust property?'\n\n'I know the clauses well enough; I know my own position; and I know\nyours also.'\n\n'D---- your impudence!' said Undy; 'how do you dare to league me with\nyour villany? Have I been the girl's trustee? have I drawn, or could I\nhave drawn, a shilling of her money? I tell you, Tudor, you are in the\nwrong box. You have one way of escape, and one only. I don't want to\nruin you; I'll save you if I can; I think you have treated the girl in\na most shameful way, nevertheless I'll save you if I can; but mark this,\nif this money be not at once produced I cannot save you.'\n\nAlaric felt that he was covered with cold perspiration. His courage did\nnot fail him; he would willingly have taken Undy by the throat, could\nhis doing so have done himself or his cause any good; but he felt that\nhe was nearly overset by the cool deep villany of his companion.\n\n'I have treated the girl badly--very badly,' he said, after a pause;\n'whether or no you have done so too I leave to your own conscience, if\nyou have a conscience. I do not now mean to accuse you; but you may know\nthis for certain--my present anxiety is to restore to her that which I\nhave taken from her; and for no earthly consideration--not to save my\nown wife--will I increase the deficiency.'\n\n'Why, man, what nonsense you talk--as if I did not know all the time\nthat you have your pocket full of these shares.'\n\n'Whatever I have, I hold for her. If I could succeed in getting out of\nyour hands enough to make up the full sum that I owe her--'\n\n'You will succeed in getting nothing from me. When I borrowed \u00c2\u00a35,000\nfrom you, it was not understood that I was to be called upon for the\nmoney in three or four months' time.'\n\n'Now look here, Scott; you have threatened me with ruin and a prison,\nand I will not say but your threats may possibly prove true. It may be\nthat I am ruined; but, if I fall, you shall share my fall.'\n\n'That's false,' said Undy. 'I am free to hold my head before the world,\nwhich you are not. I have done nothing to bring me to shame.'\n\n'Nothing to bring you to shame, and yet you would now have me give you a\nfurther portion of this girl's money!'\n\n'Nothing! I care nothing about the girl's money. I have not touched it,\nnor do I want to touch it. I bring you a message from my brother; you\nhave ample means of your own to comply with his request.'\n\n'Then tell your brother,' said Alaric, now losing all control over\nhis temper--'tell your brother, if indeed he have any part in this\nvillany--tell your brother that if it were to save me from the gallows,\nhe should not have a shilling. I have done very badly in this matter; I\nhave acted shamefully, and I am ashamed, but----'\n\n'Oh, I want to hear none of your rhapsodies,' said Undy. 'If you will\nnot now do what I ask you, I may as well go, and you may take the\nconsequences;' and he lifted his hat as though preparing to take his\nleave.\n\n'But you shall hear me,' said Alaric, rising quickly from his seat, and\nstanding between Undy and the door. Undy very coolly walked to the bell\nand rang it. 'I have much to answer for,' continued Alaric, 'but I\nwould not have your sin on my soul, I would not be as black as you are,\nthough, by being so, I could save myself with certainty from all earthly\npunishment.'\n\nAs he finished, the messenger opened the door. 'Show Mr. Scott out,'\nsaid Alaric.\n\n'By, by,' said Undy. 'You will probably hear from Mrs. Val and her\ndaughter to-morrow,' and so saying he walked jauntily along the\npassage, and went jauntily to his dinner at his club. It was part of\nhis philosophy that nothing should disturb the even tenor of his way,\nor interfere with his animal comforts. He was at the present moment\nover head and ears in debt; he was playing a game which, in all human\nprobability, would end in his ruin; the ground was sinking beneath his\nfeet on every side; and yet he thoroughly enjoyed his dinner. Alaric\ncould not make such use of his philosophy. Undy Scott might be the worse\nman of the two, but he was the better philosopher.\n\nNot on the next day, or on the next, did Alaric hear from Mrs. Val, but\non the following Monday he got a note from her begging him to call in\nEbury Street. She underscored every line of it once or twice, and added,\nin a postscript, that he would, she was sure, at once acknowledge the\nNECESSITY of her request, as she wished to communicate with him on the\nsubject of her DAUGHTER'S FORTUNE.\n\nAlaric immediately sent an answer to her by a messenger. 'My dear Mrs.\nScott,' said he, 'I am very sorry that an engagement prevents my going\nto you this evening; but, as I judge by your letter, and by what I have\nheard from Gertrude, that you are anxious about this trust arrangement,\nI will call at ten to-morrow morning on my way to the office.'\n\nHaving written and dispatched this, he sat for an hour leaning with\nhis elbows on the table and his hands clasped, looking with apparent\nearnestness at the rows of books which stood inverted before him, trying\nto make up his mind as to what step he should now take.\n\nNot that he sat an hour undisturbed. Every five minutes some one would\ncome knocking at the door; the name of some aspirant to the Civil\nService would be brought to him, or the card of some influential\ngentleman desirous of having a little job perpetrated in favour of his\nown peculiarly interesting, but perhaps not very highly-educated, young\ncandidate. But on this morning Alaric would see no one; to every such\nintruder he sent a reply that he was too deeply engaged at the present\nmoment to see any one. After one he would be at liberty, &c., &c.\n\nAnd so he sat and looked at the books; but he could in nowise make up\nhis mind. He could in nowise bring himself even to try to make up his\nmind--that is, to make any true effort towards doing so. His thoughts\nwould run off from him, not into the happy outer world, but into a\nmultitude of noisy, unpleasant paths, all intimately connected with his\npresent misery, but none of which led him at all towards the conclusions\nat which he would fain arrive. He kept on reflecting what Sir Gregory\nwould think when he heard of it; what all those clerks would say at\nthe Weights and Measures, among whom he had held his head so high; what\nshouts there would be among the navvies and other low pariahs of the\nservice; how Harry Norman would exult--(but he did not yet know Harry\nNorman);--how the Woodwards would weep; how Gertrude--and then as he\nthought of that he bowed his head, for he could no longer endure the\nopen light of day. At one o'clock he was no nearer to any decision than\nhe had been when he reached his office.\n\nAt three he put himself into a cab, and was taken to the city. Oh, the\ncity, the weary city, where men go daily to look for money, but find\nnone; where every heart is eaten up by an accursed famishing after gold;\nwhere dark, gloomy banks come thick on each other, like the black,\nugly apertures to the realms below in a mining district, each of them\na separate little pit-mouth into hell. Alaric went into the city, and\nfound that the shares were still rising. That imperturbable witness was\nstill in the chair at the committee, and men said that he was disgusting\nthe members by the impregnable endurance of his hostility. A man who\ncould answer 2,250 questions without admitting anything must be a liar!\nSuch a one could convince no one! And so the shares went on rising,\nrising, and rising, and Messrs. Blocks, Piles, and Cofferdam were buying\nup every share; either doing that openly--or else selling on the sly.\n\nAlaric found that he could at once realize \u00c2\u00a37,600. Were he to do this,\nthere would be at any rate seven-eighths of his ward's fortune secure.\n\nMight he not, in such a case, calculate that even Mrs. Val's heart would\nbe softened, and that time would be allowed him to make up the small\nremainder? Oh, but in such case he must tell Mrs. Val; and could he\ncalculate on her forbearance? Might he not calculate with much more\ncertainty on her love of triumphing? Would he not be her slave if she\nhad the keeping of his secret? And why should he run so terrible a risk\nof destroying himself? Why should he confide in Mrs. Val, and deprive\nhimself of the power of ever holding up his head again, when, possibly,\nhe might still run out his course with full sails, and bring his vessel\ninto port, giving no knowledge to the world of the perilous state in\nwhich she had been thus ploughing the deep? He need not, at any rate,\ntell everything to Mrs. Val at his coming visit on the morrow.\n\nHe consulted his broker with his easiest air of common concern as to his\nmoney; and the broker gave him a dubious opinion. 'They may go a little\nhigher, sir; indeed I think they will. But they are ticklish stock,\nsir--uncommon ticklish. I should not like to hold many myself, sir.'\nAlaric knew that the man was right; they were ticklish stock: but\nnevertheless he made up his mind to hold on a little longer.\n\nHe then got into another cab and went back to his office; and as he went\nhe began to bethink himself to whom of all his friends he might apply\nfor such a loan as would enable him to make up this sum of money, if he\nsold his shares on the morrow. Captain Cuttwater was good for \u00c2\u00a31,000,\nbut he knew that he could not get more from him. It would be bad\nborrowing, he thought, from Sir Gregory. Intimate as he had been with\nthat great man, he knew nothing of his money concerns; but he had\nalways heard that Sir Gregory was a close man. Sir Warwick, his other\ncolleague, was in easy circumstances; but then he had never been\nintimate with Sir Warwick. Norman--ah, if he had known Norman now,\nNorman would have pulled him through; but hope in that quarter there\nwas, of course, none. Norman was gone, and Norman's place had been\nfilled by Undy Scott! What could be done with Undy Scott he had already\ntried. Fidus Neverbend! he had a little money saved; but Fidus was not\nthe man to do anything without security. He, he, Alaric Tudor, he, whose\ncredit had stood, did stand, so high, did not know where to borrow, how\nto raise a thousand pounds; and yet he felt that had he not wanted it so\nsorely, he could have gotten it easily.\n\nHe was in a bad state for work when he got back to the office on\nthat day. He was flurried, ill at ease, wretched, all but distracted;\nnevertheless he went rigidly to it, and remained there till late in the\nevening. He was a man generally blessed with excellent health; but now\nhe suddenly found himself ill, and all but unable to accomplish the\ntask which he had prescribed to himself. His head was heavy and his eyes\nweak, and he could not bring himself to think of the papers which lay\nbefore him.\n\nThen at last he went home, and had another sad and solitary walk across\nthe Parks, during which he vainly tried to rally himself again, and\ncollect his energies for the work which he had to do. It was in such\nemergencies as this that he knew that it most behoved a man to fall back\nupon what manliness there might be within him; now was the time for\nhim to be true to himself; he had often felt proud of his own energy of\npurpose; and now was the opportunity for him to use such energy, if his\npride in this respect had not been all in vain.\n\nSuch were the lessons with which he endeavoured to strengthen himself,\nbut it was in vain; he could not feel courageous--he could not feel\nhopeful--he could not do other than despair. When he got home, he again\nprostrated himself, again declared himself ill, again buried his face in\nhis hands, and answered the affection of his wife by saying that a man\ncould not always be cheerful, could not always laugh. Gertrude, though\nshe was very far indeed from guessing the truth, felt that something\nextraordinary was the matter, and knew that her husband's uneasiness was\nconnected with the Scotts.\n\nHe came down to dinner, and though he ate but little, he drank glass\nafter glass of sherry. He thus gave himself courage to go out in the\nevening and face the world at his club. He found Undy there as he\nexpected, but he had no conversation with him, though they did not\nabsolutely cut each other. Alaric fancied that men stared at him, and\nsat apart by himself, afraid to stand up among talking circles, or to\nput himself forward as it was his wont to do. He himself avoided other\nmen, and then felt that others were avoiding him. He took up one evening\npaper after another, pretending to read them, but hardly noticing a word\nthat came beneath his eye: at last, however, a name struck him which\nriveted his attention, and he read the following paragraph, which was\namong many others, containing information as to the coming elections.\n\n'STRATHBOGY.--We hear that Lord Gaberlunzie's eldest son will retire\nfrom this borough, and that his place will be filled by his brother,\nthe Honourable Captain Valentine Scott. The family have been so long\nconnected with Strathbogy by ties of friendship and near neighbourhood,\nand the mutual alliance has been so much to the taste of both parties,\nthat no severance need be anticipated.'\n\nAlaric's first emotion was one of anger at the whole Scott tribe, and\nhis first resolve was to go down to Strathbogy and beat that inanimate\nfool, Captain Val, on his own ground; but he was not long in reflecting\nthat, under his present circumstances, it would be madness in him to\nbring his name prominently forward in any quarrel with the Scott family.\nThis disappointment he might at any rate bear; it would be well for him\nif this were all. He put the paper down with an affected air of easy\ncomposure, and walked home through the glaring gas-lights, still trying\nto think--still trying, but in vain, to come to some definite resolve.\n\nAnd then on the following morning he went off to call on Mrs. Val. He\nhad as yet told Gertrude nothing. When she asked him what made him start\nso early, he merely replied that he had business to do on his road. As\nhe went, he had considerable doubt whether or no it would be better for\nhim to break his word to Mrs. Val, and not go near her at all. In such\nevent he might be sure that she would at once go to work and do her\nworst; but, nevertheless, he would gain a day, or probably two, and one\nor two days might do all that he required; whereas he could not see\nMrs. Val without giving her some explanation, which if false would\nbe discovered to be false, and if true would be self-condemnatory. He\nagain, however, failed to decide, and at last knocked at Mrs. Val's door\nmerely because he found himself there.\n\nHe was shown up into the drawing-room, and found, of course, Mrs. Val\nseated on a sofa; and he also found, which was not at all of course,\nCaptain Val, on a chair on one side of the table, and M. Victoire\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe on the other. Mrs. Val shook hands with him much in\nher usual way, but still with an air of importance in her face; the\nFrenchman was delighted to see M. Tudere, and the Honourable Val got up\nfrom his chair, said 'How do?' and then sat down again.\n\n'I requested you to call, Mr. Tudor,' said Mrs. Val, opening her tale\nin a most ceremonious manner, 'because we all think it necessary to know\nsomewhat more than has yet been told to us of the manner in which my\ndaughter's money has been invested.'\n\nCaptain Val wiped his moustache with the middle finger of his right\nhand, by way of saying that he quite assented to his wife's proposition;\nand Victoire remarked that 'Madame was a leetle anxious, just a leetle\nanxious; not that anything could be wrong with M. Tudere, but because\nshe was one excellent mamma.'\n\n'I thought you knew, Mrs. Scott,' said Alaric, 'that your daughter's\nmoney is in the funds.'\n\n'Then I may understand clearly that none of the amount so invested has\nbeen sold out or otherwise appropriated by you.' said Mrs. Val.\n\n'Will you allow me to inquire what has given rise to these questions\njust at the present moment?' asked Alaric.\n\n'Yes, certainly,' said Mrs. Val; 'rumours have reached my\nhusband--rumours which, I am happy to say, I do not believe--that my\ndaughter's money has been used for purposes of speculation.' Whereupon\nCaptain Val again wiped his upper lip, but did not find it necessary to\nspeak.\n\n'May I venture to ask Captain Scott from what source such rumours have\nreached him!'\n\n'Ah-ha-what source? d---- lies, very likely; d---- lies, I dare say; but\npeople do talk--eh--you know,' so much the eloquent embryo member for\nStrathbogy vouchsafed.\n\n 'And therefore, Mr. Tudor, you mustn't be surprised that we\nshould ask you this question.'\n\n'It is one simple, simple question,' said Victoire, 'and if M. Tudere\nwill say that it is all right, I, for myself, will be satisfied.' The\namiable Victoire, to tell the truth, was still quite satisfied to leave\nhis wife's income in Alaric's hands, and would not have been at all\nsatisfied to remove it to the hands of his respected step-papa-in-law,\nor even his admired mamma-in-law.\n\n'When I undertook this trust,' said Alaric, 'which I did with\nconsiderable hesitation, I certainly did not expect to be subjected\nto any such cross-examination as this. I consider such questions as\ninsults, and therefore I shall refuse to answer them. You, Mrs. Scott,\nhave of course a right to look after your daughter's interests, as\nhas M. Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe to look after those of his wife; but I will not\nacknowledge that Captain Scott has any such right whatsoever, nor can I\nthink that his conduct in this matter is disinterested;' and as he spoke\nhe looked at Captain Val, but he might just as well have looked at the\ndoor; Captain Val only wiped his moustache with his finger once\nmore. 'My answer to your inquiries, Mrs. Scott, is this--I shall not\ncondescend to go into any details as to Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe's fortune\nwith anyone but my co-trustee. I shall, however, on Saturday next,\nbe ready to give up my trust to any other person who may be legally\nappointed to receive it, and will then produce all the property that has\nbeen entrusted to my keeping:' and so saying, Alaric got up and took his\nhat as though to depart.\n\n'And do you mean to say, Mr. Tudor, that you will not answer my\nquestion?' said Mrs. Scott.\n\n'I mean to say, most positively, that I will answer no questions,' said\nAlaric.\n\n'Oh, confound, not do at all; d----,' said the captain. 'The girl's\nmoney all gone, and you won't answer questions!'\n\n'No!' shouted Alaric, walking across the room till he closely confronted\nthe captain. 'No--no--I will answer no questions that may be asked in\nyour hearing. But that your wife's presence protects you, I would kick\nyou down your own stairs before me.'\n\nCaptain Val retreated a step--he could retreat no more--and wiped his\nmoustache with both hands at once. Mrs. Val screamed. Victoire took hold\nof the back of a chair, as though he thought it well that he should\nbe armed in the general battle that was to ensue; and Alaric, without\nfurther speech, walked out of the room, and went away to his office.\n\n'So you have given up Strathbogy?' said Sir Gregory to him, in the\ncourse of the day.\n\n'I think I have,' said Alaric; 'considering all things, I believe it\nwill be the best for me to do so.'\n\n'Not a doubt of it,' said Sir Gregory--'not a doubt of it, my dear\nfellow;' and then Sir Gregory began to evince, by the cordiality of his\nofficial confidence, that he had fully taken Alaric back into his\ngood graces. It was nothing to him that Strathbogy had given up Alaric\ninstead of Alaric giving up Strathbogy. He was sufficiently pleased at\nknowing that the danger of his being supplanted by his own junior was\nover.\n\nAnd then Alaric again went into the weary city, again made inquiries\nabout his shares, and again returned to his office, and thence to his\nhome.\n\nBut on his return to his office, he found lying on his table a note in\nUndy's handwriting, but not signed, in which he was informed that things\nwould yet be well, if the required shares should be forthcoming on the\nfollowing day.\n\nHe crumpled the note tight in his hand, and was about to fling it among\nthe waste paper, but in a moment he thought better of it, and smoothing\nthe paper straight, he folded it, and laid it carefully on his desk.\n\nThat day, on his visit into the city, he had found that the\nbridge shares had fallen to less than the value of their original\npurchase-money; and that evening he told Gertrude everything. The author\ndoes not dare to describe the telling.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nTRIBULATION\n\n\nWe must now return for a short while to Surbiton Cottage. It was not so\ngay a place as it once had been; merry laughter was not so often heard\namong the shrubbery walks, nor was a boat to be seen so often glancing\nin and out between the lawn and the adjacent island. The Cottage had\nbecome a demure, staid abode, of which Captain Cuttwater was in general\nthe most vivacious inmate; and yet there was soon to be marrying, and\ngiving in marriage.\n\nLinda's wedding-day had twice been fixed. That first-named had been\npostponed in consequence of the serious illness of Norman's elder\nbrother. The life of that brother had been very different in its course\nfrom Harry's; it had been dissipated at college in riotous living, and\nhad since been stained with debauchery during the career of his early\nmanhood in London. The consequence had been that his health had been\nbroken down, and he was now tottering to an early grave.\n\nCuthbert Norman was found to be so ill when the day first named for\nLinda's marriage approached, that it had been thought absolutely\nnecessary to postpone the ceremony. What amount of consolation Mrs.\nWoodward might have received from the knowledge that her daughter, by\nthis young man's decease, would become Mrs. Norman of Normansgrove, we\nneed not inquire; but such consolation, if it existed at all, did not\ntend to dispel the feeling of sombre disappointment which such delay was\nsure to produce. The heir, however, rallied, and another day, early in\nAugust, was fixed.\n\nKatie, the while, was still an invalid; and, as such, puzzled all the\nexperience of that very experienced medical gentleman, who has the best\naristocratic practice in the neighbourhood of Hampton Court. He, and the\nLondon physician, agreed that her lungs were not affected; but yet she\nwould not get well. The colour would not come to her cheeks, the flesh\nwould not return to her arms, nor the spirit of olden days shine forth\nin her eyes. She did not keep her bed, or confine herself to her room,\nbut she went about the house with a slow, noiseless, gentle tread, so\nunlike the step of that Katie whom we once knew.\n\nBut that which was a mystery to the experienced medical gentleman, was\nno mystery to her mother. Mrs. Woodward well knew why her child was\nno longer rosy, plump, and _d\u00c3\u00a9bonnaire_. As she watched her Katie move\nabout so softly, as she saw her constant attempt to smile whenever her\nmother's eye was on her, that mother's heart almost gave way; she almost\nbrought herself to own that she would rather see her darling the wife\nof an idle, ruined spendthrift, than watch her thus drifting away to an\nearly grave. These days were by no means happy days for Mrs. Woodward.\n\nWhen that July day was fixed for Linda's marriage, certain invitations\nwere sent out to bid the family friends to the wedding. These calls were\nnot so numerous as they had been when Gertrude became a bride. No Sir\nGregory was to come down from town, no gallant speech-makers from London\nclubs were to be gathered there, to wake the echoes of the opposite\nshore with matrimonial wit. Mrs. Woodward could not bear that her\ndaughter should be married altogether, as it were, in the dark; but for\nmany considerations the guests were to be restricted in numbers, and the\nmirth was to be restrained and quiet.\n\nWhen the list was made out, Katie saw it, and saw that Charley's name\nwas not there.\n\n'Mamma,' she said, touching her mother's arm in her sweet winning way,\n'may not Charley come to Linda's wedding? You know how fond Harry is of\nhim: would not Harry wish that he should be here?'\n\nMrs. Woodward's eyes immediately filled with tears, and she looked at\nher daughter, not knowing how to answer her. She had never spoken to\nKatie of her love; no word had ever passed between them on the subject\nwhich was now always nearest to the hearts of them both. Mrs. Woodward\nhad much in her character, as a mother, that was excellent, nay, all but\nperfect; but she could not bring herself to question her own children\nas to the inward secrets of their bosoms. She knew not at once how to\nanswer Katie's question; and so she looked up at her with wistful eyes,\nladen with tears.\n\n'You may do so, mamma,' said Katie. Katie was already a braver woman\nthan her mother. 'I think Harry would like it, and poor Charley will\nfeel hurt at being left out; you may do it, mamma, if you like; it will\nnot do any harm.'\n\nMrs. Woodward quite understood the nature of the promise conveyed in her\ndaughter's assurance, and replied that Charley should be asked. He\nwas asked, and promised, of course, to come. But when the wedding was\npostponed, when the other guests were put off, he also was informed that\nhis attendance at Hampton was not immediately required; and so he still\nremained a stranger to the Cottage.\n\nAnd then after a while another day was named, the guests, and Charley\nwith them, were again invited, and Norman was again assured that he\nshould be made happy. But, alas! his hopes were again delusive. News\narrived at Surbiton Cottage which made it indispensable that the\nmarriage should be again postponed, news worse than any which had ever\nyet been received there, news which stunned them all, and made it\nclear to them that this year was no time for marrying. Alaric had been\narrested. Alaric, their own Gertrude's own husband, their son-in-law and\nbrother-in-law, the proud, the high, the successful, the towering man of\nthe world, Alaric had been arrested, and was to be tried for embezzling\nthe money of his ward.\n\nThese fatal tidings were brought to Hampton by Harry Norman himself; how\nthey were received we must now endeavour to tell.\n\nBut that it would be tedious we might describe the amazement with which\nthat news was received at the Weights and Measures. Though the great men\nat the Weights were jealous of Alaric, they were not the less proud of\nhim. They had watched him rise with a certain amount of displeasure, and\nyet they had no inconsiderable gratification in boasting that two of the\nMagi, the two working Magi of the Civil Service, had been produced by\ntheir own establishment. When therefore tidings reached them that Tudor\nhad been summoned in a friendly way to Bow Street, that he had there\npassed a whole morning, and that the inquiry had ended in his temporary\nsuspension from his official duties, and in his having to provide two\nbailsmen, each for \u00c2\u00a31,000, as security that he would on a certain day\nbe forthcoming to stand his trial at the Old Bailey for defrauding his\nward--when, I say, these tidings were carried from room to room at the\nWeights and Measures, the feelings of surprise were equalled by those of\nshame and disappointment.\n\nNo one knew who brought this news to the Weights and Measures. No one\never does know how such tidings fly; one of the junior clerks had heard\nit from a messenger, to whom it had been told downstairs; then another\nmessenger, who had been across to the Treasury Chambers with an\nimmediate report as to a projected change in the size of the authorized\nbutter-firkin, heard the same thing, and so the news by degrees was\nconfirmed.\n\nBut all this was not sufficient for Norman. As soon as the rumour\nreached him, he went off to Bow Street, and there learnt the actual\ntruth as it has been above stated. Alaric was then there, and the\nmagistrates had decided on requiring bail; he had, in fact, been\ncommitted.\n\nIt would be dreadful that the Woodwards should first hear all this from\nthe lips of a stranger, and this reflection induced Norman at once to go\nto Hampton; but it was dreadful, also, to find himself burdened with the\ntask of first telling such tidings. When he found himself knocking at\nthe Cottage door he was still doubtful how he might best go through the\nwork he had before him.\n\nHe found that he had a partial reprieve; but then it was so partial that\nit would have been much better for him to have had no such reprieve at\nall. Mrs. Woodward was at Sunbury with Linda, and no one was at home\nbut Katie. What was he to do? was he to tell Katie? or was he to\npretend that all was right, that no special business had brought him\nunexpectedly to Hampton?\n\n'Oh, Harry, Linda will be so unhappy,' said Katie as soon as she saw\nhim. 'They have gone to dine at Sunbury, and they won't be home till\nten or eleven. Uncle Bat dined early with me, and he has gone to Hampton\nCourt. Linda will be so unhappy. But, good gracious, Harry, is there\nanything the matter?'\n\n'Mrs. Woodward has not heard from Gertrude to-day, has she?'\n\n'No--not a word--Gertrude is not ill, is she? Oh, do tell me,' said\nKatie, who now knew that there was some misfortune to be told.\n\n'No; Gertrude is not ill.'\n\n'Is Alaric ill, then? Is there anything the matter with Alaric?'\n\n'He is not ill,' said Norman, 'but he is in some trouble. I came down as\nI thought your mother should be told.'\n\nSo much he said, but would say no more. In this he probably took the\nmost unwise course that was open to him. He might have held his tongue\naltogether, and let Katie believe that love alone had brought him down,\nas it had done so often before; or he might have told her all, feeling\nsure that all must be told her before long. But he did neither; he left\nher in suspense, and the consequence was that before her mother's return\nshe was very ill.\n\nIt was past eleven before the fly was heard in which Linda and her\nmother returned home. Katie had then gone upstairs, but not to bed. She\nhad seated herself in the arm-chair in her mother's dressing-room, and\nsitting there waited till she should be told by her mother what had\noccurred. When the sound of the wheels caught her ears, she came to\nthe door of the room and held it in her hand that she might learn what\npassed. She heard Linda's sudden and affectionate greeting; she heard\nMrs. Woodward's expression of gratified surprise; and then she heard\nalso Norman's solemn tone, by which, as was too clear, all joy, all\ngratification, was at once suppressed. Then she heard the dining-room\ndoor close, and she knew that he was telling his tale to Linda and her\nmother.\n\nO the misery of that next hour! For an hour they remained there talking,\nand Katie knew nothing of what they were talking; she knew only that\nNorman had brought unhappiness to them all. A dozen different ideas\npassed across her mind. First she thought that Alaric was dismissed,\nthen that he was dead; was it not possible that Harry had named Alaric's\nname to deceive her? might not this misfortune, whatever it was, be with\nCharley? might not he be dead? Oh! better so than the other. She knew,\nand said as much to herself over and over again; but she did not the\nless feel that his death must involve her own also.\n\nAt last the dining-room door opened, and she heard her mother's step on\nthe stairs. Her heart beat so that she could hardly support herself. She\ndid not get up, but sat quite quiet, waiting for the tidings which she\nknew that she should now hear. Her mother's face, when she entered\nthe room, nearly drove her to despair; Mrs. Woodward had been crying,\nbitterly, violently, convulsively crying; and when one has reached the\nage of forty, the traces of such tears are not easily effaced even from\na woman's cheek.\n\n'Mamma, mamma, what is it? pray, pray tell me; oh! mamma, what is it?'\nsaid Katie, jumping up and rushing into her mother's arms.\n\n'Oh! Katie,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'why are you not in bed? Oh! my\ndarling, I wish you were in bed; I do so wish you were in bed--my child,\nmy child!' and, seating herself in the nearest chair, Mrs. Woodward\nagain gave herself up to uncontrolled weeping.\n\nThen Linda came up with the copious tears still streaming down her face.\nShe made no effort to control them; at her age tears are the easiest\nresource in time of grief. Norman had kept her back a moment to whisper\none word of love, and she then followed her mother into the room.\n\nKatie was now kneeling at her mother's feet. 'Linda,' she said, with\nmore quietness than either of the others was able to assume, 'what has\nhappened? what makes mamma so unhappy? Has anything happened to Alaric?'\nBut Linda was in no state to tell anything.\n\n'Do tell me, mamma,' said Katie; 'do tell me all at once. Has\nanything--anything happened to--to Charley?'\n\n'Oh, it is worse than that, a thousand times worse than that!' said Mrs.\nWoodward, who, in the agony of her own grief, became for the instant\nungenerous.\n\nKatie's blood rushed back to her heart, and for a moment her own hand\nrelaxed the hold which she had on that of her mother. She had never\nspoken of her love; for her mother's sake she had been silent; for her\nmother's sake she had determined to suffer and be silent--now, and ever!\nWell; she would bear this also. It was but for a moment she relaxed her\nhold; and then again she tightened her fingers round her mother's hand,\nand held it in a firmer grasp. 'It is Alaric, then?' she said.\n\n'God forgive me,' said Mrs. Woodward, speaking through her sobs--'God\nforgive me! I am a brokenhearted woman, and say I know not what. My\nKatie, my darling, my best of darlings--will you forgive me?'\n\n'Oh, mamma,' said Katie, kissing her mother's hands, and her arms, and\nthe very hem of her garment, 'oh, mamma, do not speak so. But I wish I\nknew what this sorrow is, so that I might share it with you; may I not\nbe told, mamma? is it about Alaric?'\n\n'Yes, Katie. Alaric is in trouble.'\n\n'What trouble--is he ill?'\n\n'No--he is not ill. It is about money.'\n\n'Has he been arrested?' asked Katie, thinking of Charley's misfortune.\n'Could not Harry get him out? Harry is so good; he would do anything,\neven for Alaric, when he is in trouble.'\n\n'He will do everything for him that he can,' said Linda, through her\ntears.\n\n'He has not been arrested,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'he is still at home;\nbut he is in trouble about Miss Golightly's money--and--and he is to be\ntried.'\n\n'Tried,' said Katie; 'tried like a criminal!'\n\nKatie might well express herself as horrified. Yes, he had to be tried\nlike a criminal; tried as pickpockets, housebreakers, and shoplifters\nare tried, and for a somewhat similar offence; with this difference,\nhowever, that pickpockets, housebreakers, and shoplifters, are seldom\neducated men, and are in general led on to crime by want. He was to be\ntried for the offence of making away with some of Miss Golightly's money\nfor his own purposes. This was explained to Katie, with more or less\nperspicuity; and then Gertrude's mother and sisters lifted up their\nvoices together and wept.\n\nHe might, it is true, be acquitted; they would none of them believe\nhim to be guilty, though they all agreed that he had probably been\nimprudent; but then the public shame of the trial! the disgrace which\nmust follow such an accusation! What a downfall was here! 'Oh, Gertrude!\noh, Gertrude!' sobbed Mrs. Woodward; and indeed, at that time, it did\nnot fare well with Gertrude.\n\nIt was very late before Mrs. Woodward and her daughters went to bed that\nnight; and then Katie, though she did not specially complain, was\nvery ill. She had lately received more than one wound, which was still\nunhealed; and now this additional blow, though she apparently bore it\nbetter than the others, altogether upset her. When the morning came, she\ncomplained of headache, and it was many days after that before she left\nher bed.\n\nBut Mrs. Woodward was up early. Indeed, she could hardly be said to have\nbeen in bed at all; for though she had lain down for an hour or two,\nshe had not slept. Early in the morning she knocked at Harry's door, and\nbegged him to come out to her. He was not long in obeying her summons,\nand soon joined her in the little breakfast parlour.\n\n'Harry, said she, 'you must go and see Alaric.'\n\nHarry's brow grew black. On the previous evening he had spoken of Alaric\nwithout bitterness, nay, almost with affection; of Gertrude he had\nspoken with the truest brotherly love; he had assured Mrs. Woodward\nthat he would do all that was in his power for them; that he would spare\nneither his exertions nor his purse. He had a truer idea than she had of\nwhat might probably be the facts of the case, and was prepared, by all\nthe means at his disposal, to help his sister-in-law, if such aid would\nhelp her. But he had not thought of seeing Alaric.\n\n'I do not think it would do any good,' said he.\n\n'Yes, Harry, it will; it will do the greatest good; whom else can I\nget to see him? who else can find out and let us know what really is\nrequired of us, what we ought to do? I would do it myself, but I could\nnot understand it; and he would never trust us sufficiently to tell me\nall the truth.'\n\n'We will make Charley go to him. He will tell everything to Charley, if\nhe will to anyone.'\n\n'We cannot trust Charley; he is so thoughtless, so imprudent. Besides,\nHarry, I cannot tell everything to Charley as I can to you. If there be\nany deficiency in this woman's fortune, of course it must be made good;\nand in that case I must raise the money. I could not arrange all this\nwith Charley.'\n\n'There cannot, I think, be very much wanting,' said Norman, who had\nhardly yet realized the idea that Alaric had actually used his ward's\nmoney for his own purposes. 'He has probably made some bad investment,\nor trusted persons that he should not have trusted. My small property\nis in the funds, and I can get the amount at a moment's notice. I do not\nthink there will be any necessity to raise more money than that. At any\nrate, whatever happens, you must not touch your own income; think of\nKatie.'\n\n'But, Harry--dear, good, generous Harry--you are so good, so generous!\nBut, Harry, we need not talk of that now. You will see him, though,\nwon't you?'\n\n'It will do no good,' said Harry; 'we have no mutual trust in each\nother.'\n\n'Do not be unforgiving, Harry, now that he requires forgiveness.'\n\n'If he does require forgiveness, Mrs. Woodward, if it shall turn out\nthat he has been guilty, God knows that I will forgive him. I trust this\nmay not be the case; and it would be useless for me to thrust myself\nupon him now, when a few days may replace us again in our present\nrelations to each other.'\n\n'I don't understand you, Harry; why should there always be a quarrel\nbetween two brothers, between the husbands of two sisters? I know you\nmean to be kind, I know you are most kind, most generous; but why should\nyou be so stern?'\n\n'What I mean is this--if I find him in adversity, I shall be ready to\noffer him my hand; it will then be for him to say whether he will take\nit. But if the storm blow over, in such case I would rather that we\nshould remain as we are.'\n\nNorman talked of forgiveness, and accused himself of no want of charity\nin this respect. He had no idea that his own heart was still hard as the\nnether millstone against Alaric Tudor. But yet such was the truth. His\nmoney he could give; he could give also his time and mind, he could lend\nhis best abilities to rescue his former friend and his own former love\nfrom misfortune. He could do this, and he thought therefore that he was\nforgiving; but there was no forgiveness in such assistance. There was\ngenerosity in it, for he was ready to part with his money; there was\nkindness of heart, for he was anxious to do good to his fellow-creature;\nbut there were with these both pride and revenge. Alaric had out-topped\nhim in everything, and it was sweet to Norman's pride that his hand\nshould be the one to raise from his sudden fall the man who had soared\nso high above him. Alaric had injured him, and what revenge is so\nperfect as to repay gross injuries by great benefits? Is it not thus\nthat we heap coals of fire on our enemies' heads? Not that Norman\nindulged in thoughts such as these; not that he resolved thus to gratify\nhis pride, thus to indulge his revenge. He was unconscious of his own\nsin, but he was not the less a sinner.\n\n'No,' said he, 'I will not see him myself; it will do no good.'\n\nMrs. Woodward found that it was useless to try to bend him. That,\nindeed, she knew from a long experience. It was then settled that she\nshould go up to Gertrude that morning, travelling up to town together\nwith Norman, and that when she had learned from her daughter, or from\nAlaric--if Alaric would talk to her about his concerns--what was really\nthe truth of the matter, she should come to Norman's office, and tell\nhim what it would be necessary for him to do.\n\nAnd then the marriage was again put off. This, in itself, was a great\nmisery, as young ladies who have just been married, or who may now be\nabout to be married, will surely own. The words 'put off' are easily\nwritten, the necessity of such a 'put off' is easily arranged in the\npages of a novel; an enforced delay of a month or two in an affair which\nso many folk willingly delay for so many years, sounds like a slight\nthing; but, nevertheless, a matrimonial 'put off' is, under any\ncircumstances, a great grief. To have to counter-write those halcyon\nnotes which have given glad promise of the coming event; to pack up and\nput out of sight, and, if possible, out of mind, the now odious finery\nwith which the house has for the last weeks been strewed; to give the\nnecessary information to the pastry-cook, from whose counter the sad\ntidings will be disseminated through all the neighbourhood; to annul the\norders which have probably been given for rooms and horses for the happy\npair; to live, during the coming interval, a mark for Pity's unpitying\nfinger; to feel, and know, and hourly calculate, how many slips there\nmay be between the disappointed lip and the still distant cup; all these\nthings in themselves make up a great grief, which is hardly lightened by\nthe knowledge that they have been caused by a still greater grief.\n\nThese things had Linda now to do, and the poor girl had none to help her\nin the doing of them. A few hurried words were spoken on that morning\nbetween her and Norman, and for the second time she set to work to put\noff her wedding. Katie, the meantime, lay sick in bed, and Mrs. Woodward\nhad gone to London to learn the worst and to do the best in this dire\naffliction that had come upon them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nALARIC TUDOR TAKES A WALK\n\n\nThere is, undoubtedly, a propensity in human love to attach itself\nto excellence; but it has also, as undoubtedly, a propensity directly\nantagonistic to this, and which teaches it to put forth its strongest\nefforts in favour of inferiority. Watch any fair flock of children in\nwhich there may be one blighted bud, and you will see that that blighted\none is the mother's darling. What filial affection is ever so strong\nas that evinced by a child for a parent in misfortune? Even among the\nrough, sympathies of schoolboys, the cripple, the sickly one, or the\norphan without a home, will find the warmest friendship and a stretch\nof kindness. Love, that must bow and do reverence to superiority, can\nprotect and foster inferiority; and what is so sweet as to be able to\nprotect?\n\nGertrude's love for her husband had never been so strong as when\nshe learnt that that love must now stand in the place of all other\nsympathies, of all other tenderness. Alaric told her of his crime, and\nin his bitterness he owned that he was no longer worthy of her love.\nShe answered by opening her arms to him with more warmth than ever, and\nbidding him rest his weary head upon her breast. Had they not taken\neach other for better or for worse? had not their bargain been that they\nwould be happy together if such should be their lot, or sad together if\nGod should so will it?--and would she be the first to cry off from such\na bargain?\n\nIt seldom happens that a woman's love is quenched by a man's crime.\nWomen in this respect are more enduring than men; they have softer\nsympathies, and less acute, less selfish, appreciation of the misery of\nbeing joined to that which has been shamed. It was not many hours since\nGertrude had boasted to herself of the honour and honesty of her lord,\nand tossed her head with defiant scorn when a breath of suspicion had\nbeen muttered against his name. Then she heard from his own lips the\nwhole truth, learnt that that odious woman had only muttered what she\nsoon would have a right to speak out openly, knew that fame and honour,\nhigh position and pride of life, were all gone; and then in that bitter\nhour she felt that she had never loved him as she did then.\n\nHe had done wrong, he had sinned grievously; but no sooner did she\nacknowledge so much than she acknowledged also that a man may sin and\nyet not be all sinful; that glory may be tarnished, and yet not utterly\ndestroyed; that pride may get a fall, and yet live to rise again. He had\nsinned, and had repented; and now to her eyes he was again as pure as\nsnow. Others would now doubt him, that must needs be the case; but\nshe would never doubt him; no, not a whit the more in that he had once\nfallen. He should still be the cynosure of her eyes, the pride of her\nheart, the centre of her hopes. Marina said of her lord, when he came to\nher shattered in limb, from the hands of the torturer--\n\n  'I would not change\n  My exiled, mangled, persecuted husband,\n  Alive or dead, for prince or paladin,\n  In story or in fable, with a world\n  To back his suit.'\n\nGertrude spoke to herself in the same language. She would not have\nchanged her Alaric, branded with infamy as he now was, or soon would be,\nfor the proudest he that carried his head high among the proud ones of\nthe earth. Such is woman's love; such is the love of which a man's heart\nis never capable!\n\nAlaric's committal had taken place very much in the manner in which it\nwas told at the Weights and Measures. He had received a note from one of\nthe Bow Street magistrates, begging his attendance in the private room\nat the police-office. There he had passed nearly the whole of one day;\nand he was also obliged to pass nearly the whole of another in the same\noffice. On this second day the proceedings were not private, and he was\naccompanied by his own solicitor.\n\nIt would be needless to describe how a plain case was, as usual, made\nobscure by the lawyers, how Acts of Parliament were consulted, how the\nmagistrate doubted, how indignant Alaric's attorney became when it was\nsuggested that some insignificant piece of evidence should be admitted,\nwhich, whether admitted or rejected, could have no real bearing on\nthe case. In these respects this important examination was like other\nimportant examinations of the same kind, such as one sees in the\nnewspapers whenever a man above the ordinary felon's rank becomes\namenable to the outraged laws. It ended, however, in Alaric being\ncommitted, and giving bail to stand his trial in about a fortnight's\ntime; and in his being assured by his attorney that he would most\ncertainly be acquitted. That bit of paper on which he had made an entry\nthat certain shares bought by him had been bought on behalf of his ward,\nwould save him; so said the attorney: to which, however, Alaric answered\nnot much. Could any acutest lawyer, let him be made of never so fine an\nassortment of forensic indignation, now whitewash his name and set\nhim again right before the world? He, of course, communicated with Sir\nGregory, and agreed to be suspended from his commissionership till the\ntrial should be over. His two colleagues then became bail for him.\n\nSo much having been settled, he got into a cab with his attorney,\nand having dropped that gentleman on the road, he returned home. The\nexcitement of the examination and the necessity for action had sustained\nhim? but now--what was to sustain him now? How was he to get through\nthe intervening fortnight, banished as he was from his office, from his\nclub, and from all haunts of men? His attorney, who had other rogues to\nattend to besides him, made certain set appointments with him--and for\nthe rest, he might sit at home and console himself as best he might with\nhis own thoughts. 'Excelsior!' This was the pass to which 'Excelsior'\nhad brought _Sic itur ad astro!_--Alas, his road had taken him hitherto\nin quite a different direction.\n\nHe sent for Charley, and when Charley came he made Gertrude explain to\nhim what had happened. He had confessed his own fault once, to his\nown wife, and he could not bring himself to do it again. Charley\nwas thunderstruck at the greatness of the ruin, but he offered what\nassistance he could give. Anything that he could do, he would. Alaric\nhad sent for him for a purpose, and that purpose at any rate Charley\ncould fulfil. He went into the city to ascertain what was now the price\nof the Limehouse bridge shares, and returned with the news that they\nwere falling, falling, falling.\n\nNo one else called at Alaric's door that day. Mrs. Val, though she did\nnot come there, by no means allowed her horses to be idle; she went\nabout sedulously among her acquaintance, dropping tidings of her\ndaughter's losses. 'They will have enough left to live upon, thank\nGod,' said she; 'but did you ever hear of so barefaced, so iniquitous\na robbery? Well, I am not cruel; but my own opinion is that he should\ncertainly be hanged.'\n\nTo this Ugolina assented fully, adding, that she had been so shocked\nby the suddenness and horror of the news, as to have become perfectly\nincapacitated ever since for any high order of thought.\n\nLactimel, whose soft bosom could not endure the idea of putting an end\nto the life of a fellow-creature, suggested perpetual banishment to the\npenal colonies; perhaps Norfolk Island. 'And what will she do?' said\nLactimel.\n\n'Indeed I cannot guess,' said Ugolina; 'her education has been sadly\ndeficient.'\n\nNone but Charley called on Alaric that day, and he found himself shut up\nalone with his wife and child. His own house seemed to him a prison.\nHe did not dare to leave it; he did not dare to walk out and face the\npublic as long as daylight continued; he was ashamed to show himself,\nand so he sat alone in his dining-room thinking, thinking, thinking. Do\nwhat he would, he could not get those shares out of his mind; they had\nentered like iron into his soul, as poison into his blood; they might\nstill rise, they might yet become of vast value, might pay all his\ndebts, and enable him to begin again. And then this had been a committee\nday; he had had no means of knowing how things had gone there, of\nlearning the opinions of the members, of whispering to Mr. Piles, or\nhearing the law on the matter laid down by the heavy deep voice of the\ngreat Mr. Blocks. And so he went on thinking, thinking, thinking, but\never as though he had a clock-weight fixed to his heart and pulling at\nits strings. For, after all, what were the shares or the committee to\nhim? Let the shares rise to ever so fabulous a value, let the Chancellor\nof the Exchequer be ever so complaisant in giving away his money, what\navail would it be to him? what avail now? He must stand his trial for\nthe crime of which he had been guilty.\n\nWith the utmost patience Gertrude endeavoured to soothe him, and to\nbring his mind into some temper in which it could employ itself. She\nbrought him their baby, thinking that he would play with his child, but\nall that he said was--'My poor boy! I have ruined him already;' and\nthen turning away from the infant, he thrust his hands deep into his\ntrousers-pockets, and went on calculating about the shares.\n\nWhen the sun had well set, and the daylight had, at last, dwindled out,\nhe took up his hat and wandered out among the new streets and rows of\nhouses which lay between his own house and the Western Railway. He got\ninto a district in which he had never been before, and as he walked\nabout here, he thought of the fate of other such swindlers as\nhimself;--yes, though he did not speak the word, he pronounced it as\nplainly, and as often, in the utterance of his mind, as though it was\nbeing rung out to him from every steeple in London; he thought of the\nfate of such swindlers as himself; how one had been found dead in the\nstreets, poisoned by himself; how another, after facing the cleverest\nlawyers in the land, was now dying in a felon's prison; how a third had\nvainly endeavoured to fly from justice by aid of wigs, false whiskers,\npainted furrows, and other disguises. Should he try to escape also,\nand avoid the ignominy of a trial? He knew it would be in vain; he knew\nthat, at this moment, he was dogged at the distance of some thirty yards\nby an amiable policeman in mufti, placed to watch his motions by his two\nkind bailsmen, who preferred this small expense to the risk of losing a\nthousand pounds a-piece.\n\nAs he turned short round a corner, into the main road leading from the\nrailway station to Bayswater, he came close upon a man who was walking\nquickly in the opposite direction, and found himself face to face\nwith Undy Scott. How on earth should Undy Scott have come out there to\nBayswater, at that hour of the night, he, the constant denizen of clubs,\nthe well-known frequenter of Pall Mall, the member for the Tillietudlem\nburghs, whose every hour was occupied in the looking after things\npolitical, or things commercial? Who could have expected him in a back\nroad at Bayswater? There, however, he was, and Alaric, before he knew of\nhis presence, had almost stumbled against him.\n\n'Scott!' said Alaric, starting back.\n\n'Hallo, Tudor, what the deuce brings you here? but I suppose you'll ask\nme the same question?' said Undy.\n\nAlaric Tudor could not restrain himself. 'You scoundrel,' said he,\nseizing Undy by the collar; 'you utterly unmitigated scoundrel! You\npremeditated, wilful villain!' and he held Undy as though he intended to\nchoke him.\n\nBut Undy Scott was not a man to be thus roughly handled with impunity;\nand in completing the education which he had received, the use of his\nfists had not been overlooked. He let out with his right hand, and\nstruck Alaric twice with considerable force on the side of his jaw, so\nthat the teeth rattled in his mouth.\n\nBut Alaric, at the moment, hardly felt it. 'You have brought me and mine\nto ruin,' said he; 'you have done it purposely, like a fiend. But, low\nas I have fallen, I would not change places with you for all that the\nearth holds. I have been a villain; but such villany as yours--ugh--'\nand so saying, he flung his enemy from him, and Undy, tottering back,\nsaved himself against the wall.\n\nIn a continued personal contest between the two men, Undy would probably\nhave had the best of it, for he would certainly have been the cooler of\nthe two, and was also the more skilful in such warfare; but he felt in\na moment that he could gain nothing by thrashing Tudor, whereas he might\ndamage himself materially by having his name brought forward at the\npresent moment in connexion with that of his old friend.\n\n'You reprobate!' said he, preparing to pass on; 'it has been my\nmisfortune to know you, and one cannot touch pitch and not be defiled.\nBut, thank God, you'll come by your deserts now. If you will take my\nadvice you'll hang yourself;' and so they parted.\n\nThe amiable policeman in mufti remained at a convenient distance during\nthis little interview, having no special mission to keep the peace,\npending his present employment; but, as he passed by, he peered into\nUndy's face, and recognized the honourable member for the Tillietudlem\nburghs. A really sharp policeman knows every one of any note in London.\nIt might, perhaps, be useful that evidence should be given at the\nforthcoming trial of the little contest which we have described. If so,\nour friend in mufti was prepared to give it.\n\nOn the following morning, at about eleven, a cab drove up to the door,\nand Alaric, standing at the dining-room window, saw Mrs. Woodward get\nout of it.\n\n'There's your mother,' said Alaric to his wife. 'I will not see her--let\nher go up to the drawing-room.'\n\n'Oh! Alaric, will you not see mamma?'\n\n'How can I, with my face swollen as it is now? Besides, what would be\nthe good? What can I say to her? I know well enough what she has to say\nto me, without listening to it.'\n\n'Dear Alaric, mamma will say nothing to you that is not kind; do see\nher, for my sake, Alaric.'\n\nBut misery had not made him docile. He merely turned from her, and shook\nhis head impatiently. Gertrude then ran out to welcome her mother, who\nwas in the hall.\n\nAnd what a welcoming it was! 'Come upstairs, mamma, come into the\ndrawing-room,' said Gertrude, who would not stop even to kiss her mother\ntill they found themselves secured from the servants' eyes. She knew\nthat one word of tenderness would bring her to the ground.\n\n'Mamma, mamma!' she almost shrieked, and throwing herself into her\nmother's arms wept convulsively. Mrs. Woodward wanted no more words to\ntell her that Alaric had been guilty.\n\n'But, Gertrude, how much is it?' whispered the mother, as, after a few\nmoments of passionate grief, they sat holding each other's hands on the\nsofa. 'How much money is wanting? Can we not make it up? If it be all\npaid before the day of trial, will not that do? will not that prevent\nit?'\n\nGertrude could not say. She knew that \u00c2\u00a310,000 had been abstracted. Mrs.\nWoodward groaned as she heard the sum named. But then there were those\nshares, which had not long since been worth much more than half that\nsum, which must still be worth a large part of it.\n\n'But we must know, dearest, before Harry can do anything,' said Mrs.\nWoodward.\n\nGertrude blushed crimson when Harry Norman's name was mentioned. And had\nit come to that--that they must look to him for aid?\n\n'Can you not ask him, love?' said Mrs. Woodward. 'I saw him in the\ndining-room; go and ask him; when he knows that we are doing our best\nfor him, surely he will help us.'\n\nGertrude, with a heavy heart, went down on her message, and did not\nreturn for fifteen or twenty minutes. It may easily be conceived that\nNorman's name was not mentioned between her and her husband, but she\nmade him understand that an effort would be made for him if only the\ntruth could be ascertained.\n\n'It will be of no use,' said he.\n\n'Don't say so, Alaric; we cannot tell what may be of use. But at any\nrate it will be weight off your heart to know that this money has been\npaid. It is that which overpowers you now, and not your own misfortune.'\n\nAt last he suffered her to lead him, and she put down on paper such\nfigures as he dictated to her. It was, however, impossible to say what\nwas the actual deficiency; that must depend upon the present value\nof the shares; these he said he was prepared to give over to his own\nattorney, if it was thought that by so doing he should be taking the\nbest steps towards repairing the evil he had done; and then he began\ncalculating how much the shares might possibly be worth, and pointing\nout under what circumstances they should be sold, and under what again\nthey should be overheld till the market had improved. All this was worse\nthan Greek to Gertrude; but she collected what facts she could, and then\nreturned to her mother.\n\nAnd they discussed the matter with all the wit and all the volubility\nwhich women have on such occasions. Paper was brought forth, and\naccounts were made out between them, not such as would please the eyes\nof a Civil Service Examiner, but yet accurate in their way. How they\nworked and racked their brains, and strained their women's nerves in\nplanning how justice might be defeated, and the dishonesty of the loved\none covered from shame! Uncle Bat was ready with his share. He had\nreceived such explanation as Mrs. Woodward had been able to give, and\nthough when he first heard the news he had spoken severely of Alaric,\nstill his money should be forthcoming for the service of the family. He\ncould produce some fifteen hundred pounds; and would if needs be that\nhe should do so. Then Harry--but the pen fell from Gertrude's fingers as\nshe essayed to write down Harry Norman's contribution to the relief of\nher husband's misery.\n\n'Remember, Gertrude, love, in how short a time he will be your brother.'\n\n'But when will it be, mamma? Is it to be on Thursday, as we had planned?\nOf course, mamma, I cannot be there.'\n\nAnd then there was a break in their accounts, and Mrs. Woodward\nexplained to Gertrude that they had all thought it better to postpone\nLinda's marriage till after the trial; and this, of course was\nthe source of fresh grief. When men such as Alaric Tudor stoop to\ndishonesty, the penalties of detection are not confined to their own\nhearthstone. The higher are the branches of the tree and the wider, the\ngreater will be the extent of earth which its fall will disturb.\n\nGertrude's pen, however, again went to work. The shares were put down\nat \u00c2\u00a35,000. 'If they can only be sold for so much, I think we may\nmanage it,' said Mrs. Woodward; 'I am sure that Harry can get the\nremainder--indeed he said he could have more than that.'\n\n'And what will Linda do?'\n\n'Linda will never want it, love; and if she did, what of that? would she\nnot give all she has for you?'\n\nAnd then Mrs. Woodward went her way to Norman's office, without having\nspoken to Alaric. 'You will come again soon, mamma,' said Gertrude. Mrs.\nWoodward promised that she would.\n\n'And, mamma,' and she whispered close into her mother's ear, as she made\nher next request; 'and, mamma, you will be with me on that day?'\n\nWe need not follow Norman in his efforts to have her full fortune\nrestored to Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe. He was daily in connexion with Alaric's\nlawyer, and returned sometimes with hope and sometimes without it. Mrs.\nVal's lawyer would receive no overtures towards a withdrawal of the\ncharge, or even towards any mitigation in their proceedings, unless the\nagent coming forward on behalf of the lady's late trustee, did so with\nthe full sum of \u00c2\u00a320,000 in his hands.\n\nWe need not follow Charley, who was everyday with Alaric, and who was,\nunknown to Alaric, an agent between him and Norman. 'Well, Charley, what\nare they doing to-day?' was Alaric's constant question to him, even up\nto the very eve of his trial.\n\nIf any spirit ever walks it must be that of the stock-jobber, for how can\nsuch a one rest in its grave without knowing what shares are doing?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nTHE LAST BREAKFAST\n\n\nAnd that day was not long in coming; indeed, it came with terrible\nalacrity; much too quickly for Gertrude, much too quickly for Norman;\nand much too quickly for Alaric's lawyer. To Alaric only did the time\npass slowly, for he found himself utterly without employment.\n\nNorman and Uncle Bat between them had raised something about \u00c2\u00a36,000; but\nwhen the day came on which they were prepared to dispose of the shares,\nthe Limehouse bridge was found to be worth nothing. They were, as the\nbroker had said, ticklish stock; so ticklish that no one would have them\nat any price. When Undy, together with his agent from Tillietudlem,\nwent into the market about the same time to dispose of theirs, they were\nequally unsuccessful. How the agent looked and spoke and felt may\nbe imagined; for the agent had made large advances, and had no other\nsecurity; but Undy had borne such looks and speeches before, and merely\nsaid that it was very odd--extremely odd; he had been greatly deceived\nby Mr. Piles. Mr. Piles also said it was very odd; but he did not appear\nto be nearly so much annoyed as the agent from Tillietudlem; and it was\nwhispered that, queer as things now looked, Messrs. Blocks, Piles, and\nCofferdam, had not made a bad thing of the bridge.\n\nOverture after overture was made to the lawyer employed by Mrs. Val's\nparty. Norman first offered the \u00c2\u00a36,000 and the shares; then when the\nshares were utterly rejected by the share-buying world, he offered to\nmake himself personally responsible for the remainder of the debt, and\nto bind himself by bond to pay it within six months. At first these\npropositions were listened to, and Alaric's friends were led to believe\nthat the matter would be handled in such a way that the prosecution\nwould fall to the ground. But at last all composition was refused. The\nadverse attorney declared, first, that he was not able to accept any\nmoney payment short of the full amount with interest, and then he\naverred, that as criminal proceedings had been taken they could not now\nbe stayed. Whether or no Alaric's night attack had anything to do\nwith this, whether Undy had been the means of instigating this rigid\nadherence to justice, we are not prepared to say.\n\nThat day for which Gertrude had prayed her mother's assistance came\nall too soon. They had become at last aware that the trial must go on.\nCharley was with them on the last evening, and completed their despair\nby telling them that their attorney had resolved to make no further\nefforts at a compromise.\n\nPerhaps the most painful feeling to Gertrude through the whole of the\nlast fortnight had been the total prostration of her husband's energy,\nand almost of his intellect; he seemed to have lost the power of judging\nfor himself, and of thinking and deciding what conduct would be best for\nhim in his present condition. He who had been so energetic, so full of\nlife, so ready for all emergencies, so clever at devices, so able to\nmanage not only for himself but for his friends, he was, as it were,\nparalysed and unmanned. He sat from morning to night looking at the\nempty fire-grate, and hardly ventured to speak of the ordeal that he had\nto undergo.\n\nHis lawyer was to call for him on the morning of the trial, and Mrs.\nWoodward was to be at the house soon after he had left it. He had not\nyet seen her since the inquiry had commenced, and it was very plain that\nhe did not wish to do so. Mrs. Woodward was to be there and to remain\ntill his fate had been decided, and then-- Not a word had yet been said\nas to the chance of his not returning; but Mrs. Woodward was aware that\nhe would probably be unable to do so, and felt, that if such should be\nthe case, she could not leave her daughter alone.\n\nAnd so Alaric and his wife sat down to breakfast on that last morning.\nShe had brought their boy down; but as she perceived that the child's\npresence did not please his father, he had been sent back to the\nnursery, and they were alone. She poured out his tea for him, put bread\nupon his plate, and then sat down close beside him, endeavouring to\npersuade him to eat. She had never yet found fault with him, she had\nnever even ventured to give him counsel, but now she longed to entreat\nhim to collect himself and take a man's part in the coming trial. He\nsat in the seat prepared for him, but, instead of eating, he thrust his\nhands after his accustomed manner into his pockets and sat glowering at\nthe tea-cups.\n\n'Come, Alaric, won't you eat your breakfast?' said she.\n\n'No; breakfast! no-how can I eat now? how can you think that I could eat\nat such a time as this? Do you take yours; never mind me.'\n\n'But, dearest, you will be faint if you do not eat; think what you have\nto go through; remember how many eyes will be on you to-day.'\n\nHe shuddered violently as she spoke, and motioned to her with his hand\nnot to go on with what she was saying.\n\n'I know, I know,' said she passionately, 'dearest, dearest love--I know\nhow dreadful it is; would that I could bear it for you! would that I\ncould!'\n\nHe turned away his head, for a tear was in his eye. It was the first\nthat had come to his assistance since this sorrow had come upon him.\n\n'Don't turn from me, dearest Alaric; do not turn from me now at our\nlast moments. To me at least you are the same noble Alaric that you ever\nwere.'\n\n'Noble!' said he, with all the self-scorn which he so truly felt.\n\n'To me you are, now as ever; but, Alaric, I do so fear that you will\nwant strength, physical strength, you know, to go through all this. I\nwould have you bear yourself like a man before them all.'\n\n'It will be but little matter,' said he.\n\n'It will be matter. It will be matter to me. My darling, darling\nhusband, rouse yourself,' and she knelt before his knees and prayed to\nhim; 'for my sake do it; eat and drink that you may have the power of a\nman when all the world is looking at you. If God forgives us our sins,\nsurely we should so carry ourselves that men may not be ashamed to do\nso.'\n\nHe did not answer her, but he turned to the table and broke the bread,\nand put his lips to the cup. And then she gave him food as she would\ngive it to a child, and he with a child's obedience ate and drank what\nwas put before him. As he did so, every now and again a single tear\nforced itself beneath his eyelid and trickled down his face, and in some\ndegree Gertrude was comforted.\n\nHe had hardly finished his enforced breakfast when the cab and the\nlawyer came to the door. The learned gentleman had the good taste not to\ncome in, and so the servant told them that Mr. Gitemthruet was there.\n\n'Say that your master will be with him in a minute,' said Gertrude,\nquite coolly; and then the room door was again closed, and the husband\nand wife had now to say adieu.\n\nAlaric rose from his chair and made a faint attempt to smile. 'Well,\nGertrude,' said he, 'it has come at last.'\n\nShe rushed into his embrace, and throwing her arms around him, buried\nher face upon his breast. 'Alaric, Alaric, my husband! my love, my best,\nmy own, my only love!'\n\n'I cannot say much now, Gertrude, but I know how good you are; you will\ncome and see me, if they will let you, won't you?'\n\n'See you!' said she, starting back, but still holding him and looking\nup earnestly into his face. 'See you!' and then she poured out her love\nwith all the passion of a Ruth: '\"Whither thou goest, I will go; and\nwhere thou lodgest, I will lodge.... Where thou diest, will I die, and\nthere will I be buried; the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught\nbut death part thee and me.\" See you, Alaric; oh, it cannot be that they\nwill hinder the wife from being with her husband. But, Alaric,' she went\non, 'do not droop now, love--will you?'\n\n'I cannot brazen it out,' said he. 'I know too well what it is that I\nhave done.'\n\n'No, not that, Alaric; I would not have that. But remember, all is not\nover, whatever they may do. Ah, how little will really be over, whatever\nthey can do! You have repented, have you not, Alaric?'\n\n'I think so, I hope so,' said Alaric, with his eyes upon the ground.\n\n'You have repented, and are right before God; do not fear then what man\ncan do to you. I would not have you brazen, Alaric; but be manly, be\ncollected, be your own self, the man that I have loved, the man that I\ndo now love so well, better, better than ever;' and she threw herself\non him and kissed him and clung to him, and stroked his hair and put her\nhand upon his face, and then holding him from her, looked up to him as\nthough he were a hero whom she all but worshipped.\n\n'Gertrude, Gertrude--that I should have brought you to this!'\n\n'Never mind,' said she; 'we will win through it yet--we will yet be\nhappy together, far, far away from here--remember that--let that support\nyou through all. And now, Alaric, you will come up for one moment and\nkiss him before you go.'\n\n'The man will be impatient.'\n\n'Never mind; let him be impatient--you shall not go away without blessing\nyour boy; come up, Alaric.' And she took him by the hand and led him\nlike a child into the nursery.\n\n'Where is the nurse? bring him here--papa is going away-- Alley, boy,\ngive papa a big kiss.'\n\nAlaric, for the first time for the fortnight, took the little fellow\ninto his arms and kissed him. 'God bless you, my bairn,' said he,\n'and grant that all this may never be visited against you, here or\nhereafter!'\n\n'And now go,' said Gertrude, as they descended the stairs together, 'and\nmay God in His mercy watch over and protect you and give you back to me!\nAnd, Alaric, wherever you are I will be close to you, remember that. I\nwill be quite, quite close to you. Now, one kiss--oh, dearest, dearest\nAlaric--there--there--now go.' And so he went, and Gertrude shutting\nherself into her room threw herself on to the bed, and wept aloud.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nMR. CHAFFANBRASS\n\n\nWe must now follow Alaric to his trial. He was, of course, much too soon\nat court. All people always are, who are brought to the court perforce,\ncriminals for instance, and witnesses, and other such-like unfortunate\nwretches; whereas many of those who only go there to earn their bread\nare very often as much too late. He was to be tried at the Old Bailey.\nAs I have never seen the place, and as so many others have seen it, I\nwill not attempt to describe it. Here Mr. Gitemthruet was quite at\nhome; he hustled and jostled, elbowed and ordered, as though he were the\nsecond great man of the place, and the client whom he was to defend was\nthe first. In this latter opinion he was certainly right. Alaric was\nthe hero of the day, and people made way for him as though he had won a\nvictory in India, and was going to receive the freedom of the city in a\nbox. As he passed by, a gleam of light fell on him from a window, and\nat the instant three different artists had him photographed,\ndaguerreotyped, and bedevilled; four graphic members of the public press\ntook down the details of his hat, whiskers, coat, trousers, and boots;\nand the sub-editor of the _Daily Delight_ observed that 'there was a\nslight tremor in the first footstep which he took within the precincts\nof the prison, but in every other respect his demeanour was dignified\nand his presence manly; he had light-brown gloves, one of which was on\nhis left hand, but the other was allowed to swing from his fingers.\nThe court was extremely crowded, and some fair ladies appeared there to\ngrace its customarily ungracious walls. On the bench we observed Lord\nKilltime, Sir Gregory Hardlines, and Mr. Whip Vigil. Mr. Undecimus\nScott, who had been summoned as a witness by the prisoner, was also\naccommodated by the sheriffs with a seat.' Such was the opening\nparagraph of the seven columns which were devoted by the _Daily Delight_\nto the all-absorbing subject.\n\nBut Mr. Gitemthruet made his way through artists, reporters, and the\nagitated crowd with that happy air of command which can so easily be\nassumed by men at a moment's notice, when they feel themselves to be for\nthat moment of importance. 'Come this way, Mr. Tudor; follow me and\nwe will get on without any trouble; just follow me close,' said Mr.\nGitemthruet to his client, in a whisper which was audible to not a few.\nTudor, who was essaying, and not altogether unsuccessfully, to bear the\npublic gaze undismayed, did as he was bid, and followed Mr. Gitemthruet.\n\n'Now,' said the attorney, 'we'll sit here--Mr. Chaffanbrass will be\nclose to us, there; so that I can touch him up as we go along; of\ncourse, you know, you can make any suggestion, only you must do it\nthrough me. Here's his lordship; uncommon well he looks, don't he? You'd\nhardly believe him to be seventy-seven, but he's not a day less, if he\nisn't any more; and he has as much work in him yet as you or I, pretty\nnearly. If you want to insure a man's life, Mr. Tudor, put him on the\nbench; then he'll never die. We lawyers are not like bishops, who are\nalways for giving up, and going out on a pension.'\n\nBut Alaric was not at the moment inclined to meditate much on the long\nyears of judges. He was thinking, or perhaps trying to think, whether\nit would not be better for him to save this crowd that was now gathered\ntogether all further trouble, and plead guilty at once. He knew he was\nguilty, he could not understand that it was possible that any juryman\nshould have a doubt about it; he had taken the money that did not belong\nto him; that would be made quite clear; he had taken it, and had not\nrepaid it; there was the absolute _corpus delicti_ in court, in the\nshape of a deficiency of some thousands of pounds. What possible doubt\nwould there be in the breast of anyone as to his guilt? Why should he\nvex his own soul by making himself for a livelong day the gazing-stock\nfor the multitude? Why should he trouble all those wigged counsellors,\nwhen one word from him would set all at rest?\n\n'Mr. Gitemthruet, I think I'll plead guilty,' said he.\n\n'Plead what!' said Mr. Gitemthruet, turning round upon his client with a\nsharp, angry look. It was the first time that his attorney had shown any\nsign of disgust, displeasure, or even disapprobation since he had taken\nAlaric's matter in hand. 'Plead what! Ah, you're joking, I know; upon my\nsoul you gave me a start.'\n\nAlaric endeavoured to explain to him that he was not joking, nor in\na mood to joke; but that he really thought the least vexatious course\nwould be for him to plead guilty.\n\n'Then I tell you it would be the most vexatious proceeding ever I heard\nof in all my practice. But you are in my hands, Mr. Tudor, and you can't\ndo it. You have done me the honour to come to me, and now you must be\nruled by me. Plead guilty! Why, with such a case as you have got, you\nwould disgrace yourself for ever if you did so. Think of your friends,\nMr. Tudor, if you won't think of me or of yourself.'\n\nHis lawyer's eloquence converted him, and he resolved that he would run\nhis chance. During this time all manner of little legal preliminaries\nhad been going on; and now the court was ready for business; the jury\nwere in their box, the court-keeper cried silence, and Mr. Gitemthruet\nwas busy among his papers with frantic energy. But nothing was yet seen\nof the great Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n'I believe we may go on with the trial for breach of trust,' said the\njudge. 'I do not know why we are waiting.'\n\nThen up and spoke Mr. Younglad, who was Alaric's junior counsel. Mr.\nYounglad was a promising common-law barrister, now commencing his\ncareer, of whom his friends were beginning to hope that he might, if\nhe kept his shoulders well to the collar, at some distant period make a\nliving out of his profession. He was between forty and forty-five years\nof age, and had already overcome the natural diffidence of youth in\naddressing a learned bench and a crowded court.\n\n'My lud,' said Younglad, 'my learned friend, Mr. Chaffanbrass, who leads\nfor the prisoner, is not yet in court. Perhaps, my lud, on behalf of my\nclient, I may ask for a few moments' delay.'\n\n'And if Mr. Chaffanbrass has undertaken to lead for the prisoner, why\nis he not in court?' said the judge, looking as though he had uttered a\nposer which must altogether settle Mr. Younglad's business.\n\nBut Mr. Younglad had not been sitting, and walking and listening, let\nalone talking occasionally, in criminal courts, for the last twenty\nyears, to be settled so easily.\n\n'My lud, if your ludship will indulge me with five minutes' delay--we\nwill not ask more than five minutes--your ludship knows, no one better,\nthe very onerous duties--'\n\n'When I was at the bar I took no briefs to which I could not attend,'\nsaid the judge.\n\n'I am sure you did not, my lud; and my learned friend, should he ever\nsit in your ludship's seat, will be able to say as much for himself,\nwhen at some future time he may be--; but, my lud, Mr. Chaffanbrass is\nnow in court.' And as he spoke, Mr. Chaffanbrass, carrying in his hand a\nhuge old blue bag, which, as he entered, he took from his clerk's hands,\nand bearing on the top of his head a wig that apparently had not been\ndressed for the last ten years, made his way in among the barristers,\ncaring little on whose toes he trod, whose papers he upset, or whom he\nelbowed on his road. Mr. Chaffanbrass was the cock of this dunghill, and\nwell he knew how to make his crowing heard there.\n\n'And now, pray, let us lose no more time,' said the judge.\n\n'My lord, if time has been lost through me, I am very sorry; but if your\nlordship's horse had fallen down in the street as mine did just now----'\n\n'My horse never falls down in the street, Mr. Chaffanbrass.'\n\n'Some beasts, my lord, can always keep their legs under them, and others\ncan't; and men are pretty much in the same condition. I hope the former\nmay be the case with your lordship and your lordship's cob for many\nyears.' The judge, knowing of old that nothing could prevent Mr.\nChaffanbrass from having the last word, now held his peace, and the\ntrial began.\n\nThere are not now too many pages left to us for the completion of our\ntale; but, nevertheless, we must say a few words about Mr. Chaffanbrass.\nHe was one of an order of barristers by no means yet extinct, but of\nwhom it may be said that their peculiarities are somewhat less often\nseen than they were when Mr. Chaffanbrass was in his prime. He confined\nhis practice almost entirely to one class of work, the defence, namely,\nof culprits arraigned for heavy crimes, and in this he was, if not\nunrivalled, at least unequalled. Rivals he had, who, thick as the skins\nof such men may be presumed to be, not unfrequently writhed beneath\nthe lashes which his tongue could inflict. To such a perfection had he\ncarried his skill and power of fence, so certain was he in attack, so\ninvulnerable when attacked, that few men cared to come within the reach\nof his forensic flail. To the old stagers who were generally opposed to\nhim, the gentlemen who conducted prosecutions on the part of the Crown,\nand customarily spent their time and skill in trying to hang those\nmarauders on the public safety whom it was the special business of Mr.\nChaffanbrass to preserve unhung, to these he was, if not civil, at least\nforbearing; but when any barrister, who was comparatively a stranger\nto him, ventured to oppose him, there was no measure to his impudent\nsarcasm and offensive sneers.\n\nThose, however, who most dreaded Mr. Chaffanbrass, and who had most\noccasion to do so, were the witnesses. A rival lawyer could find a\nprotection on the bench when his powers of endurance were tried too\nfar; but a witness in a court of law has no protection. He comes there\nunfeed, without hope of guerdon, to give such assistance to the State\nin repressing crime and assisting justice as his knowledge in this\nparticular case may enable him to afford; and justice, in order to\nascertain whether his testimony be true, finds it necessary to subject\nhim to torture. One would naturally imagine that an undisturbed thread\nof clear evidence would be best obtained from a man whose position was\nmade easy and whose mind was not harassed; but this is not the fact: to\nturn a witness to good account, he must be badgered this way and that\ntill he is nearly mad; he must be made a laughingstock for the court;\nhis very truths must be turned into falsehoods, so that he may be\nfalsely shamed; he must be accused of all manner of villany, threatened\nwith all manner of punishment; he must be made to feel that he has\nno friend near him, that the world is all against him; he must be\nconfounded till he forget his right hand from his left, till his mind be\nturned into chaos, and his heart into water; and then let him give his\nevidence. What will fall from his lips when in this wretched collapse\nmust be of special value, for the best talents of practised forensic\nheroes are daily used to bring it about; and no member of the Humane\nSociety interferes to protect the wretch. Some sorts of torture are,\nas it were, tacitly allowed even among humane people. Eels are skinned\nalive, and witnesses are sacrificed, and no one's blood curdles at the\nsight, no soft heart is sickened at the cruelty.\n\nTo apply the thumbscrew, the boot, and the rack to the victim before him\nwas the work of Mr. Chaffanbrass's life. And it may be said of him that\nthe labour he delighted in physicked pain. He was as little averse to\nthis toil as the cat is to that of catching mice. And, indeed, he was\nnot unlike a cat in his method of proceeding; for he would, as it were,\nhold his prey for a while between his paws, and pat him with gentle taps\nbefore he tore him. He would ask a few civil little questions in his\nsoftest voice, glaring out of his wicked old eye as he did so at those\naround him, and then, when he had his mouse well in hand, out would come\nhis envenomed claw, and the wretched animal would feel the fatal wound\nin his tenderest part.\n\nMankind in general take pleasure in cruelty, though those who are\ncivilized abstain from it on principle. On the whole Mr. Chaffanbrass\nis popular at the Old Bailey. Men congregate to hear him turn a witness\ninside out, and chuckle with an inward pleasure at the success of his\ncruelty. This Mr. Chaffanbrass knows, and, like an actor who is kept up\nto his high mark by the necessity of maintaining his character, he never\nallows himself to grow dull over his work. Therefore Mr. Chaffanbrass\nbullies when it is quite unnecessary that he should bully; it is a\nlabour of love; and though he is now old, and stiff in his joints,\nthough ease would be dear to him, though like a gladiator satiated with\nblood, he would as regards himself be so pleased to sheathe his sword,\nyet he never spares himself. He never spares himself, and he never\nspares his victim.\n\nAs a lawyer, in the broad and high sense of the word, it may be presumed\nthat Mr. Chaffanbrass knows little or nothing. He has, indeed, no\noccasion for such knowledge. His business is to perplex a witness and\nbamboozle a jury, and in doing that he is generally successful. He\nseldom cares for carrying the judge with him: such tactics, indeed, as\nhis are not likely to tell upon a judge. That which he loves is, that\na judge should charge against him, and a jury give a verdict in his\nfavour. When he achieves that he feels that he has earned his money.\nLet others, the young lads and spooneys of his profession, undertake\nthe milk-and-water work of defending injured innocence; it is all but\nan insult to his practised ingenuity to invite his assistance to such\ntasteless business. Give him a case in which he has all the world\nagainst him; Justice with her sword raised high to strike; Truth with\nopen mouth and speaking eyes to tell the bloody tale; outraged humanity\nshrieking for punishment; a case from which Mercy herself, with averted\neyes, has loathing turned and bade her sterner sister do her work; give\nhim such a case as this, and then you will see Mr. Chaffanbrass in his\nglory. Let him, by the use of his high art, rescue from the gallows and\nturn loose upon the world the wretch whose hands are reeking with\nthe blood of father, mother, wife, and brother, and you may see Mr.\nChaffanbrass, elated with conscious worth, rub his happy hands with\ninfinite complacency. Then will his ambition be satisfied, and he will\nfeel that in the verdict of the jury he has received the honour due\nto his genius. He will have succeeded in turning black into white, in\nwashing the blackamoor, in dressing in the fair robe of innocence the\nfoulest, filthiest wretch of his day; and as he returns to his home, he\nwill be proudly conscious that he is no little man.\n\nIn person, however, Mr. Chaffanbrass is a little man, and a very dirty\nlittle man. He has all manner of nasty tricks about him, which make\nhim a disagreeable neighbour to barristers sitting near to him. He\nis profuse with snuff, and very generous with his handkerchief. He\nis always at work upon his teeth, which do not do much credit to his\nindustry. His wig is never at ease upon his head, but is poked about by\nhim, sometimes over one ear, sometimes over the other, now on the back\nof his head, and then on his nose; and it is impossible to say in which\nguise he looks most cruel, most sharp, and most intolerable. His linen\nis never clean, his hands never washed, and his clothes apparently never\nnew. He is about five feet six in height, and even with that stoops\ngreatly. His custom is to lean forward, resting with both hands on the\nsort of desk before him, and then to fix his small brown basilisk eye\non the victim in the box before him. In this position he will remain\nunmoved by the hour together, unless the elevation and fall of his\nthick eyebrows and the partial closing of his wicked eyes can be called\nmotion. But his tongue! that moves; there is the weapon which he knows\nhow to use!\n\nSuch is Mr. Chaffanbrass in public life; and those who only know him in\npublic life can hardly believe that at home he is one of the most easy,\ngood-tempered, amiable old gentlemen that ever was pooh-poohed by his\ngrown-up daughters, and occasionally told to keep himself quiet in a\ncorner. Such, however, is his private character. Not that he is a fool\nin his own house; Mr. Chaffanbrass can never be a fool; but he is so\nessentially good-natured, so devoid of any feeling of domestic tyranny,\nso placid in his domesticities, that he chooses to be ruled by his own\nchildren. But in his own way he is fond of hospitality; he delights in\na cosy glass of old port with an old friend in whose company he may be\nallowed to sit in his old coat and old slippers. He delights also in his\nbooks, in his daughters' music, and in three or four live pet dogs,\nand birds, and squirrels, whom morning and night he feeds with his\nown hands. He is charitable, too, and subscribes largely to hospitals\nfounded for the relief of the suffering poor.\n\nSuch was Mr. Chaffanbrass, who had been selected by the astute Mr.\nGitemthruet to act as leading counsel on behalf of Alaric. If any human\nwisdom could effect the escape of a client in such jeopardy, the\nwisdom of Mr. Chaffanbrass would be likely to do it; but, in truth, the\nevidence was so strong against him, that even this Newgate hero almost\nfeared the result.\n\nI will not try the patience of anyone by stating in detail all the\ncircumstances of the trial. In doing so I should only copy, or, at\nany rate, might copy, the proceedings at some of those modern _causes\nc\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8bres_ with which all those who love such subjects are familiar. And\nwhy should I force such matters on those who do not love them? The usual\nopening speech was made by the chief man on the prosecuting side, who,\nin the usual manner, declared 'that his only object was justice; that\nhis heart bled within him to see a man of such acknowledged public\nutility as Mr. Tudor in such a position; that he sincerely hoped that\nthe jury might find it possible to acquit him, but that--' And then went\ninto his 'but' with so much venom that it was clearly discernible\nto all, that in spite of his protestations, his heart was set upon a\nconviction.\n\nWhen he had finished, the witnesses for the prosecution were called--the\npoor wretches whose fate it was to be impaled alive that day by Mr.\nChaffanbrass. They gave their evidence, and in due course were impaled.\nMr. Chaffanbrass had never been greater. The day was hot, and he thrust\nhis wig back till it stuck rather on the top of his coat-collar than on\nhis head; his forehead seemed to come out like the head of a dog from\nhis kennel, and he grinned with his black teeth, and his savage eyes\ntwinkled, till the witnesses sank almost out of sight as they gazed at\nhim.\n\nAnd yet they had very little to prove, and nothing that he could\ndisprove. They had to speak merely to certain banking transactions, to\nsay that certain moneys had been so paid in and so drawn out, in stating\nwhich they had their office books to depend on. But not the less on this\naccount were they made victims. To one clerk it was suggested that\nhe might now and then, once in three months or so, make an error in\na figure; and, having acknowledged this, he was driven about until he\nadmitted that it was very possible that every entry he made in the bank\nbooks in the course of the year was false. 'And you, such as you,'\nsaid Mr. Chaffanbrass, 'do you dare to come forward to give evidence on\ncommercial affairs? Go down, sir, and hide your ignominy.' The wretch,\nconvinced that he was ruined for ever, slunk out of court, and was\nashamed to show himself at his place of business for the next three\ndays.\n\nThere were ten or twelve witnesses, all much of the same sort, who\nproved among them that this sum of twenty thousand pounds had been\nplaced at Alaric's disposal, and that now, alas! the twenty thousand\npounds were not forthcoming. It seemed to be a very simple case; and, to\nAlaric's own understanding, it seemed impossible that his counsel should\ndo anything for him. But as each impaled victim shrank with agonized\nterror from the torture, Mr. Gitemthruet would turn round to Alaric\nand assure him that they were going on well, quite as well as he had\nexpected. Mr. Chaffanbrass was really exerting himself; and when Mr.\nChaffanbrass did really exert himself he rarely failed.\n\nAnd so the long day faded itself away in the hot sweltering court,\nand his lordship, at about seven o'clock, declared his intention of\nadjourning. Of course a _cause c\u00c3\u00a9l\u00c3\u00a8bre_ such as this was not going to\ndecide itself in one day. Alaric's guilt was clear as daylight to all\nconcerned; but a man who had risen to be a Civil Service Commissioner,\nand to be entrusted with the guardianship of twenty thousand pounds, was\nnot to be treated like a butcher who had merely smothered his wife in an\nordinary way, or a housebreaker who had followed his professional career\nto its natural end; more than that was due to the rank and station\nof the man, and to the very respectable retaining fee with which\nMr. Gitemthruet had found himself enabled to secure the venom of Mr.\nChaffanbrass. So the jury retired to regale themselves _en masse_ at a\nneighbouring coffee-house; Alaric was again permitted to be at large on\nbail (the amiable policeman in mufti still attending him at a distance);\nand Mr. Chaffanbrass and his lordship retired to prepare themselves by\nrest for the morrow's labours.\n\nBut what was Alaric to do? He soon found himself under the guardianship\nof the constant Gitemthruet in a neighbouring tavern, and his cousin\nCharley was with him. Charley had been in court the whole day, except\nthat he had twice posted down to the West End in a cab to let Gertrude\nand Mrs. Woodward know how things were going on. He had posted down and\nposted back again, and, crowded as the court had been, he had\ncontrived to make his way in, using that air of authority to which\nthe strongest-minded policeman will always bow; till at last the very\npolicemen assisted him, as though he were in some way connected with the\ntrial.\n\nOn his last visit at Gertrude's house he had told her that it was very\nimprobable that the trial should be finished that day. She had then\nsaid nothing as to Alaric's return to his own house; it had indeed not\noccurred to her that he would be at liberty to do so: Charley at once\ncaught at this, and strongly recommended his cousin to remain where he\nwas. 'You will gain nothing by going home,' said he; 'Gertrude does\nnot expect you; Mrs. Woodward is there; and it will be better for all\nparties that you should remain.' Mr. Gitemthruet strongly backed his\nadvice, and Alaric, so counselled, resolved to remain where he was.\nCharley promised to stay with him, and the policeman in mufti, without\nmaking any promise at all, silently acquiesced in the arrangement.\nCharley made one more visit to the West, saw Norman at his lodgings, and\nMrs. Woodward and Gertrude in Albany Place, and then returned to make a\nnight of it with Alaric. We need hardly say that Charley made a night\nof it in a very different manner from that to which he and his brother\nnavvies were so well accustomed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nTHE OLD BAILEY\n\n\nThe next morning, at ten o'clock, the court was again crowded. The\njudge was again on his bench, prepared for patient endurance; and Lord\nKilltime and Sir Gregory Hardlines were alongside of him. The jury were\nagain in their box, ready with pen and paper to give their brightest\nattention--a brightness which will be dim enough before the long day be\nover; the counsel for the prosecution were rummaging among their papers;\nthe witnesses for the defence were sitting there among the attorneys,\nwith the exception of the Honourable Undecimus Scott, who was\naccommodated with a seat near the sheriff, and whose heart, to tell the\ntruth, was sinking somewhat low within his breast, in spite of the glass\nof brandy with which he had fortified himself. Alaric was again present\nunder the wings of Mr. Gitemthruet; and the great Mr. Chaffanbrass was\nin his place. He was leaning over a slip of paper which he held in\nhis hand, and with compressed lips was meditating his attack upon his\nenemies; on this occasion his wig was well over his eyes, and as he\npeered up from under it to the judge's face, he cocked his nose with an\nair of supercilious contempt for all those who were immediately around\nhim.\n\nIt was for him to begin the day's sport by making a speech, not so much\nin defence of his client as in accusation of the prosecutors. 'It had\nnever,' he said, 'been his fate, he might say his misfortune, to hear a\ncase against a man in a respectable position, opened by the Crown with\nsuch an amount of envenomed virulence.' He was then reminded that the\nprosecution was not carried on by the Crown. 'Then,' said he, 'we\nmay attribute this virulence to private malice; that it is not to be\nattributed to any fear that this English bride should lose her fortune,\nor that her French husband should be deprived of any portion of his\nspoil, I shall be able to prove to a certainty. Did I allow myself that\naudacity of denunciation which my learned friend has not considered\nincompatible with the dignity of his new silk gown? Could I permit\nmyself such latitude of invective as he has adopted?'--a slight laugh\nwas here heard in the court, and an involuntary smile played across the\njudge's face--'yes,' continued Mr. Chaffanbrass, 'I boldly aver that I\nhave never forgotten myself, and what is due to humanity, as my learned\nfriend did in his address to the jury. Gentlemen of the jury, you\nwill not confound the natural indignation which counsel must feel when\ndefending innocence from the false attacks, with the uncalled-for, the\nunprofessional acerbity which has now been used in promoting such an\naccusation as this. I may at times be angry, when I see mean falsehood\nbefore me in vain assuming the garb of truth--for with such juries as\nI meet here it generally is in vain--I may at times forget myself in\nanger; but, if we talk of venom, virulence, and eager hostility, I yield\nthe palm, without a contest, to my learned friend in the new silk gown.'\n\nHe then went on to dispose of the witnesses whom they had heard on the\nprevious day, and expressed a regret that an _expos\u00c3\u00a9_ should have been\nmade so disgraceful to the commercial establishments of this\ngreat commercial city. It only showed what was the effect on such\nestablishments of that undue parsimony which was now one of the crying\nevils of the times. Having thus shortly disposed of them, he came to\nwhat all men knew was the real interest of the day's doings. 'But,' said\nhe, 'the evidence in this case, to which your attention will be chiefly\ndirected, will be, not that for the accusation, but that for the\ndefence. It will be my business to show to you, not only that my client\nis guiltless, but to what temptations to be guilty he has been purposely\nand wickedly subjected. I shall put into that bar an honourable member\nof the House of Commons, who will make some revelations as to his\nown life, who will give us an insight into the ways and means of a\nlegislator, which will probably surprise us all, not excluding his\nlordship on the bench. He will be able to explain to us--and I trust I\nmay be able to induce him to do so, for it is possible that he may be a\nlittle coy--he will be able to explain to us why my client, who is in no\nway connected either with the Scotts, or the Golightlys, or the Figgs,\nor the Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pes, why he was made the lady's trustee; and he will\nalso, perhaps, tell us, after some slight, gentle persuasion, whether he\nhas himself handled, or attempted to handle, any of this lady's money.'\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass then went on to state that, as the forms of the court\nwould not give him the power of addressing the jury again, he must now\nexplain to them what he conceived to be the facts of the case. He then\nadmitted that his client, in his anxiety to do the best he could with\nthe fortune entrusted to him, had invested it badly. The present fate\nof these unfortunate bridge shares, as to which the commercial world\nhad lately held so many different opinions, proved that: but it had\nnevertheless been a _bona fide_ investment, made in conjunction with,\nand by the advice of, Mr. Scott, the lady's uncle, who thus, for his own\npurposes, got possession of money which was in truth confided to him for\nother purposes. His client, Mr. Chaffanbrass acknowledged, had behaved\nwith great indiscretion; but the moment he found that the investment\nwould be an injurious one to the lady whose welfare was in his hands, he\nat once resolved to make good the whole amount from his own pocket. That\nhe had done so, or, at any rate, would have done so, but for this trial,\nwould be proved to them. Nobler conduct than this it was impossible to\nimagine. Whereas, the lady's uncle, the honourable member of Parliament,\nthe gentleman who had made a stalking-horse of his, Mr. Chaffanbrass's,\nclient, refused to refund a penny of the spoil, and was now the\ninstigator of this most unjust proceeding.\n\nAs Mr. Chaffanbrass thus finished his oration, Undy Scott tried to smile\ncomplacently on those around him. But why did the big drops of\nsweat stand on his brow as his eye involuntarily caught those of Mr.\nChaffanbrass? Why did he shuffle his feet, and uneasily move his hands\nand feet hither and thither, as a man does when he tries in vain to be\nunconcerned? Why did he pull his gloves on and off, and throw himself\nback with that affected air which is so unusual to him? All the court\nwas looking at him, and every one knew that he was wretched. Wretched!\naye, indeed he was; for the assurance even of an Undy Scott, the\nhardened man of the clubs, the thrice elected and twice rejected of\nTillietudlem, fell prostrate before the well-known hot pincers of\nChaffanbrass, the torturer!\n\nThe first witness called was Henry Norman. Alaric looked up for a moment\nwith surprise, and then averted his eyes. Mr. Gitemthruet had concealed\nfrom him the fact that Norman was to be called. He merely proved\nthis, that having heard from Mrs. Woodward, who was the prisoner's\nmother-in-law, and would soon be his own mother-in-law, that a\ndeficiency had been alleged to exist in the fortune of Madame\nJaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe, he had, on the part of Mrs. Woodward, produced what he\nbelieved would cover this deficiency, and that when he had been informed\nthat more money was wanting, he had offered to give security that the\nwhole should be paid in six months. Of course, on him Mr. Chaffanbrass\nexercised none of his terrible skill, and as the lawyers on the other\nside declined to cross-examine him, he was soon able to leave the court.\nThis he did speedily, for he had no desire to witness Alaric's misery.\n\nAnd then the Honourable Undecimus Scott was put into the witness-box. It\nwas suggested, on his behalf, that he might give his evidence from the\nseat which he then occupied, but this Mr. Chaffanbrass would by no means\nallow. His intercourse with Mr. Scott, he said, must be of a nearer,\ncloser, and more confidential nature than such an arrangement as that\nwould admit. A witness, to his way of thinking, was never an efficient\nwitness till he had his arm on the rail of a witness-box. He must\ntrouble Mr. Scott to descend from the grandeur of his present position;\nhe might return to his seat after he had been examined--if he then\nshould have a mind to do so. Our friend Undy found that he had to obey,\nand he was soon confronted with Mr. Chaffanbrass in the humbler manner\nwhich that gentleman thought so desirable.\n\n'You are a member of the House of Commons, I believe, Mr. Scott?' began\nMr. Chaffanbrass.\n\nUndy acknowledged that he was so.\n\n'And you are the son of a peer, I believe?'\n\n'A Scotch peer,' said Undy.\n\n'Oh, a Scotch peer,' said Mr. Chaffanbrass, bringing his wig forward\nover his left eye in a manner that was almost irresistible--'a Scotch\npeer--a member of Parliament, and son of a Scotch peer; and you have\nbeen a member of the Government, I believe, Mr. Scott?'\n\nUndy confessed that he had been in office for a short time.\n\n'A member of Parliament, a son of a peer, and one of the Government of\nthis great and free country. You ought to be a proud and a happy man.\nYou are a man of fortune, too, I believe, Mr. Scott?'\n\n'That is a matter of opinion,' said Undy; 'different people have\ndifferent ideas. I don't know what you call fortune.'\n\n'Why I call \u00c2\u00a320,000 a fortune--this sum that the lady had who married\nthe Frenchman. Have you \u00c2\u00a320,000?'\n\n'I shall not answer that question.'\n\n'Have you \u00c2\u00a310,000? You surely must have as much as that, as I know you\nmarried a fortune yourself,--unless, indeed, a false-hearted trustee has\ngot hold of your money also. Come, have you got \u00c2\u00a310,000?'\n\n'I shall not answer you.'\n\n'Have you got any income at all? Now, I demand an answer to that on your\noath, sir.'\n\n'My lord, must I answer such questions?' said Undy.\n\n'Yes, sir; you must answer them, and many more like them,' said Mr.\nChaffanbrass. 'My lord, it is essential to my client that I should prove\nto the jury whether this witness is or is not a penniless adventurer; if\nhe be a respectable member of society, he can have no objection to let\nme know whether he has the means of living.'\n\n'Perhaps, Mr. Scott,' said the judge, 'you will not object to state\nwhether or no you possess any fixed income.'\n\n'Have you, or have you not, got an income on which you live?' demanded\nMr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n'I have an income,' said Undy, not, however, in a voice that betokened\nmuch self-confidence in the strength of his own answer.\n\n'You have an income, have you? And now, Mr. Scott, will you tell us what\nprofession you follow at this moment with the object of increasing your\nincome? I think we may surmise, by the tone of your voice, that your\nincome is not very abundant.'\n\n'I have no profession,' said Undy.\n\n'On your oath, you are in no profession?'\n\n'Not at present.'\n\n'On your oath, you are not a stock-jobber?'\n\nUndy hesitated for a moment.\n\n'By the virtue of your oath, sir, are you a stock-jobber, or are you\nnot?'\n\n'No, I am not. At least, I believe not.'\n\n'You believe not!' said Mr. Chaffanbrass--and it would be necessary to\nhear the tone in which this was said to understand the derision which\nwas implied. 'You believe you are not a stock-jobber! Are you, or\nare you not, constantly buying shares and selling shares--railway\nshares--bridge shares--mining shares--and such-like?'\n\n'I sometimes buy shares.'\n\n'And sometimes sell them?'\n\n'Yes--and sometimes sell them.'\n\nWhere Mr. Chaffanbrass had got his exact information, we cannot say;\nbut very exact information he had acquired respecting Undy's\nlittle transactions. He questioned him about the Mary Janes and Old\nFriendships, about the West Corks and the Ballydehob Branch, about\nsundry other railways and canals, and finally about the Limehouse\nbridge; and then again he asked his former question. 'And now,' said he,\n'will you tell the jury whether you are a stock-jobber or no?'\n\n'It is all a matter of opinion,' said Undy. 'Perhaps I may be, in your\nsense of the word.'\n\n'My sense of the word!' said Mr. Chaffanbrass. 'You are as much a\nstock-jobber, sir, as that man is a policeman, or his lordship is\na judge. And now, Mr. Scott, I am sorry that I must go back to your\nprivate affairs, respecting which you are so unwilling to speak. I fear\nI must trouble you to tell me this--How did you raise the money with\nwhich you bought that latter batch--the large lump of the bridge\nshares--of which we were speaking?'\n\n'I borrowed it from Mr. Tudor,' said Undy, who had prepared himself to\nanswer this question glibly.\n\n'You borrowed it from Mr. Alaric Tudor--that is, from the gentleman now\nupon his trial. You borrowed it, I believe, just at the time that he\nbecame the lady's trustee?'\n\n'Yes,' said Undy; 'I did so.'\n\n'You have not repaid him as yet?'\n\n'No--not yet,' said Undy.\n\n'I thought not. Can you at all say when Mr. Tudor may probably get his\nmoney?'\n\n'I am not at present prepared to name a day. When the money was lent it\nwas not intended that it should be repaid at an early day.'\n\n'Oh! Mr. Tudor did not want his money at an early day--didn't he? But,\nnevertheless, he has, I believe, asked for it since, and that very\npressingly?'\n\n'He has never asked for it,' said Undy.\n\n'Allow me to remind you, Mr. Scott, that I have the power of putting my\nclient into that witness-box, although he is on his trial; and, having\nso reminded you, let me again beg you to say whether he has not asked\nyou for repayment of this large sum of money very pressingly.'\n\n'No; he has never done so.'\n\n'By the value of your oath, sir--if it has any value--did not my\nclient beseech you to allow these shares to be sold while they were yet\nsaleable, in order that your niece's trust money might be replaced in\nthe English funds?'\n\n'He said something as to the expediency of selling them, and I differed\nfrom him.'\n\n'You thought it would be better for the lady's interest that they should\nremain unsold?'\n\n'I made no question of the lady's interest. I was not her trustee.'\n\n'But the shares were bought with the lady's money.'\n\n'What shares?' asked Undy.\n\n'What shares, sir? Those shares which you had professed to hold on the\nlady's behalf, and which afterwards you did not scruple to call your\nown. Those shares of yours--since you have the deliberate dishonesty\nso to call them--those shares of yours, were they not bought with the\nlady's money?'\n\n'They were bought with the money which I borrowed from Mr. Tudor.'\n\n'And where did Mr. Tudor get that money?'\n\n'That is a question you must ask himself,' said Undy.\n\n'It is a question, sir, that just at present I prefer to ask you. Now,\nsir, be good enough to tell the jury, whence Mr. Tudor got that money;\nor tell them, if you dare do so, that you do not know.'\n\nUndy for a minute remained silent, and Mr. Chaffanbrass remained silent\nalso. But if the fury of his tongue for a moment was at rest, that of\nhis eyes was as active as ever. He kept his gaze steadily fixed upon the\nwitness, and stood there with compressed lips, still resting on his two\nhands, as though he were quite satisfied thus to watch the prey that was\nin his power. For an instant he glanced up to the jury, and then allowed\nhis eyes to resettle on the face of the witness, as though he might have\nsaid, 'There, gentlemen, there he is--the son of a peer, a member of\nParliament; what do you think of him?'\n\nThe silence of that minute was horrible to Undy, and yet he could hardly\nbring himself to break it. The judge looked at him with eyes which\nseemed to read his inmost soul; the jury looked at him, condemning him\none and all; Alaric looked at him with fierce, glaring eyes of hatred,\nthe same eyes that had glared at him that night when he had been\ncollared in the street; the whole crowd looked at him derisively; but\nthe eyes of them all were as nothing to the eyes of Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n'I never saw him so great; I never did,' said Mr. Gitemthruet,\nwhispering to his client; and Alaric, even he, felt some consolation in\nthe terrible discomfiture of his enemy.\n\n'I don't know where he got it,' said Undy, at last breaking the terrible\nsilence, and wiping the perspiration from his brow.\n\n'Oh, you don't!' said Mr. Chaffanbrass, knocking his wig back, and\ncoming well out of his kennel. 'After waiting for a quarter of an\nhour or so, you are able to tell the jury at last that you don't know\nanything about it. He took the small trifle of change out of his pocket,\nI suppose?'\n\n'I don't know where he took it from.'\n\n'And you didn't ask?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'You got the money; that was all you know. But this was just at the\ntime that Mr. Tudor became the lady's trustee; I think you have admitted\nthat.'\n\n'It may have been about the time.'\n\n'Yes; it may have been about the time, as you justly observe, Mr. Scott.\nLuckily, you know, we have the dates of the two transactions. But it\nnever occurred to your innocent mind that the money which you got into\nyour hands was a part of the lady's fortune; that never occurred to your\ninnocent mind--eh, Mr. Scott?'\n\n'I don't know that my mind is a more innocent mind than your own,' said\nUndy.\n\n'I dare say not. Well, did the idea ever occur to your guilty mind?'\n\n'Perhaps my mind is not more guilty than your own, either.'\n\n'Then may God help me,' said Mr. Chaffanbrass, 'for I must be at a bad\npass. You told us just now, Mr. Scott, that some time since Mr. Tudor\nadvised you to sell these shares--what made him give you this advice?'\n\n'He meant, he said, to sell his own.'\n\n'And he pressed you to sell yours?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'He urged you to do so more than once?'\n\n'Yes; I believe he did.'\n\n'And now, Mr. Scott, can you explain to the jury why he was so\nsolicitous that you should dispose of your property?'\n\n'I do not know why he should have done so, unless he wanted back his\nmoney.'\n\n'Then he did ask for his own money?'\n\n'No; he never asked for it. But if I had sold the shares perhaps he\nmight have asked for it.'\n\n'Oh!' said Mr. Chaffanbrass; and as he uttered the monosyllable he\nlooked up at the jury, and gently shook his head, and gently shook his\nhands. Mr. Chaffanbrass was famous for these little silent addresses to\nthe jury-box.\n\nBut not even yet had he done with this suspicious loan. We cannot follow\nhim through the whole of his examination; for he kept our old friend\nunder the harrow for no less than seven hours. Though he himself made no\nfurther statement to the jury, he made it perfectly plain, by Undy's own\nextracted admissions, or by the hesitation of his denials, that he had\nknowingly received this money out of his niece's fortune, and that he\nhad refused to sell the shares bought with this money, when pressed to\ndo so by Tudor, in order that the trust-money might be again made up.\n\nThere were those who blamed Mr. Chaffanbrass for thus admitting that his\nclient had made away with his ward's money by lending it to Undy; but\nthat acute gentleman saw clearly that he could not contend against the\nfact of the property having been fraudulently used; but he saw that he\nmight induce the jury to attach so much guilt to Undy, that Tudor would,\nas it were, be whitened by the blackness of the other's villany. The\njudge, he well knew, would blow aside all this froth; but then the judge\ncould not find the verdict.\n\nTowards the end of the day, when Undy was thoroughly worn out--at which\ntime, however, Mr. Chaffanbrass was as brisk as ever, for nothing ever\nwore him out when he was pursuing his game--when the interest of those\nwho had been sweltering in the hot court all the day was observed to\nflag, Mr. Chaffanbrass began twisting round his finger a bit of paper,\nof which those who were best acquainted with his manner knew that he\nwould soon make use.\n\n'Mr. Scott,' said he, suddenly dropping the derisive sarcasm of his\nformer tone, and addressing him with all imaginable courtesy, 'could you\noblige me by telling me whose handwriting that is?' and he handed to him\nthe scrap of paper. Undy took it, and saw that the writing was his own;\nhis eyes were somewhat dim, and he can hardly be said to have read it.\nIt was a very short memorandum, and it ran as follows: 'All will yet be\nwell, if those shares be ready to-morrow morning.'\n\n'Well, Mr. Scott,' said the lawyer, 'do you recognize the handwriting?'\n\nUndy looked at it, and endeavoured to examine it closely, but he could\nnot; his eyes swam, and his head was giddy, and he felt sick. Could he\nhave satisfied himself that the writing was not clearly and manifestly\nhis own, he would have denied the document altogether; but he feared to\ndo this; the handwriting might be proved to be his own.\n\n'It is something like my own,' said he.\n\n'Something like your own, is it?' said Mr. Chaffanbrass, as though he\nwere much surprised. 'Like your own! Well, will you have the goodness to\nread it?'\n\nUndy turned it in his hand as though the proposed task were singularly\ndisagreeable to him. Why, thought he to himself, should he be thus\nbrowbeaten by a dirty old Newgate lawyer? Why not pluck up his courage,\nand, at any rate, show that he was a man? 'No,' said he, 'I will not\nread it.'\n\n'Then I will. Gentlemen of the jury, have the goodness to listen to me.'\nOf course there was a contest then between him and the lawyers on the\nother side whether the document might or might not be read; but equally\nof course the contest ended in the judge's decision that it should be\nread. And Mr. Chaffanbrass did read it in a voice audible to all men.\n'All will yet be well, if those shares be ready to-morrow morning.' We\nmay take it as admitted, I suppose, that this is in your handwriting,\nMr. Scott?'\n\n'It probably may be, though I will not say that it is.'\n\n'Do you not know, sir, with positive certainty that it is your writing?'\n\nTo this Undy made no direct answer. 'What is your opinion, Mr. Scott?'\nsaid the judge; 'you can probably give an opinion by which the jury\nwould be much guided.'\n\n'I think it is, my lord,' said Undy.\n\n'He thinks it is, said Mr. Chaffanbrass, addressing the jury. 'Well,\nfor once I agree with you. I think it is also--and how will you have the\ngoodness to explain it. To whom was it addressed?'\n\n'I cannot say.'\n\n'When was it written?'\n\n'I do not know.'\n\n'What does it mean?'\n\n'I cannot remember.'\n\n'Was it addressed to Mr. Tudor?'\n\n'I should think not.'\n\n'Now, Mr. Scott, have the goodness to look at the jury, and to speak a\nlittle louder. You are in the habit of addressing a larger audience than\nthis, and cannot, therefore, be shamefaced. You mean to tell the jury\nthat you think that that note was not intended by you for Mr. Tudor?'\n\n'I think not,' said Undy.\n\n'But you can't say who it was intended for?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'And by the virtue of your oath, you have told us all that you know\nabout it?' Undy remained silent, but Mr. Chaffanbrass did not press\nhim for an answer. 'You have a brother, named Valentine, I think.' Now\nCaptain Val had been summoned also, and was at this moment in court.\nMr. Chaffanbrass requested that he might be desired to leave it, and,\nconsequently, he was ordered out in charge of a policeman.\n\n'And now, Mr. Scott--was that note written by you to Mr. Tudor, with\nreference to certain shares, which you proposed that Mr. Tudor should\nplace in your brother's hands? Now, sir, I ask you, as a member of\nParliament, as a member of the Government, as the son of a peer, to give\na true answer to that question.' And then again Undy was silent;\nand again Mr. Chaffanbrass leant on the desk and glared at him. 'And\nremember, sir, member of Parliament and nobleman as you are, you shall\nbe indicted for perjury, if you are guilty of perjury.'\n\n'My lord,' said Undy, writhing in torment, 'am I to submit to this?'\n\n'Mr. Chaffanbrass,' said the judge, 'you should not threaten your\nwitness. Mr. Scott--surely you can answer the question.'\n\nMr. Chaffanbrass seemed not to have even heard what the judge said, so\nintently were his eyes fixed on poor Undy. 'Well, Mr. Scott,' he said at\nlast, very softly, 'is it convenient for you to answer me? Did that note\nrefer to a certain number of bridge shares, which you required Mr. Tudor\nto hand over to the stepfather of this lady?'\n\nUndy had no trust in his brother. He felt all but sure that, under\nthe fire of Mr. Chaffanbrass, he would confess everything. It would be\nterrible to own the truth, but it would be more terrible to be indicted\nfor perjury. So he sat silent.\n\n'My lord, perhaps you will ask him,' said Mr. Chaffanbrass.\n\n'Mr. Scott, you understand the question--why do you not answer it?'\nasked the judge. But Undy still remained silent.\n\n'You may go now,' said Mr. Chaffanbrass. 'Your eloquence is of the\nsilent sort; but, nevertheless, it is very impressive. You may go now,\nand sit on that bench again, if, after what has passed, the sheriff\nthinks proper to permit it.'\n\nUndy, however, did not try that officer's complaisance. He retired\nfrom the witness-box, and was not again seen during the trial in any\nconspicuous place in the court.\n\nIt was then past seven o'clock; but Mr. Chaffanbrass insisted on going\non with the examination of Captain Val. It did not last long. Captain\nVal, also, was in that disagreeable position, that he did not know what\nUndy had confessed, and what denied. So he, also, refused to answer\nthe questions of Mr. Chaffanbrass, saying that he might possibly damage\nhimself should he do so. This was enough for Mr. Chaffanbrass, and then\nhis work was done.\n\nAt eight o'clock the court again adjourned; again Charley posted\noff--for the third time that day--to let Gertrude know that, even\nas yet, all was not over; and again he and Alaric spent a melancholy\nevening at the neighbouring tavern; and then, again, on the third\nmorning, all were re-assembled at the Old Bailey.\n\nOr rather they were not all re-assembled. But few came now, and they\nwere those who were obliged to come. The crack piece of the trial, that\nportion to which, among the connoisseurs, the interest was attached,\nthat was all over. Mr. Chaffanbrass had done his work. Undy Scott,\nthe member of Parliament, had been gibbeted, and the rest was, in\ncomparison, stale, flat, and unprofitable. The judge and jury, however,\nwere there, so were the prosecuting counsel, so were Mr. Chaffanbrass\nand Mr. Younglad, and so was poor Alaric. The work of the day was\ncommenced by the judge's charge, and then Alaric, to his infinite\ndismay, found how all the sophistry and laboured arguments of his very\ntalented advocate were blown to the winds, and shown to be worthless.\n'Gentlemen,' said the judge to the jurors, after he had gone through\nall the evidence, and told them what was admissible, and what was\nnot--'gentlemen, I must especially remind you, that in coming to a\nverdict in the matter, no amount of guilt on the part of any other\nperson can render guiltless him whom you are now trying, or palliate his\nguilt if he be guilty. An endeavour has been made to affix a deep stigma\non one of the witnesses who has been examined before you; and to induce\nyou to feel, rather than to think, that Mr. Tudor is, at any rate,\ncomparatively innocent--innocent as compared with that gentleman. That\nis not the issue which you are called on to decide; not whether Mr.\nScott, for purposes of his own, led Mr. Tudor on to guilt, and then\nturned against him; but whether Mr. Tudor himself has, or has not, been\nguilty under this Act of Parliament that has been explained to you.\n\n'As regards the evidence of Mr. Scott, I am justified in telling you,\nthat if the prisoner's guilt depended in any way on that evidence, it\nwould be your duty to receive it with the most extreme caution, and\nto reject it altogether if not corroborated. That evidence was not\ntrustworthy, and in a great measure justified the treatment which the\nwitness encountered from the learned barrister who examined him. But Mr.\nScott was a witness for the defence, not for the prosecution. The case\nfor the prosecution in no way hangs on his evidence.\n\n'If it be your opinion that Mr. Tudor is guilty, and that he was\nunwarily enticed into guilt by Mr. Scott; that the whole arrangement of\nthis trust was brought about by Mr. Scott or others, to enable him or\nthem to make a cat's-paw of this new trustee, and thus use the lady's\nmoney for their own purposes, such an opinion on your part may justify\nyou in recommending the prisoner to the merciful consideration of the\nbench; but it cannot justify you in finding a verdict of not guilty.'\n\nAs Alaric heard this, and much more to the same effect, his hopes, which\ncertainly had been high during the examination of Undy Scott, again sank\nto zero, and left him in despair. He had almost begun to doubt the fact\nof his own guilt, so wondrously had his conduct been glossed over by\nMr. Chaffanbrass, so strikingly had any good attempt on his part been\nbrought to the light, so black had Scott been made to appear. Ideas\nfloated across his brain that he might go forth, not only free of the\nlaw, but whitewashed also in men's opinions, that he might again sit on\nhis throne at the Civil Service Board, again cry to himself 'Excelsior,'\nand indulge the old dreams of his ambition.\n\nBut, alas! the deliberate and well-poised wisdom of the judge seemed to\nshower down cold truth upon the jury from his very eyes. His words\nwere low in their tone, though very clear, impassive, delivered without\ngesticulation or artifice, such as that so powerfully used by Mr.\nChaffanbrass; but Alaric himself felt that it was impossible to doubt\nthe truth of such a man; impossible to suppose that any juryman should\ndo so. Ah me! why had he brought himself thus to quail beneath the gaze\nof an old man seated on a bench? with what object had he forced himself\nto bend his once proud neck? He had been before in courts such as this,\nand had mocked within his own spirit the paraphernalia of the horsehair\nwigs, the judges' faded finery, and the red cloth; he had laughed at\nthe musty, stale solemnity by which miscreants were awed, and policemen\nenchanted; now, these things told on himself heavily enough; he felt now\ntheir weight and import.\n\nAnd then the jury retired from the court to consider their verdict, and\nMr. Gitemthruet predicted that they would be hungry enough before they\nsat down to their next meal. 'His lordship was dead against us,' said\nMr. Gitemthruet; 'but that was a matter of course; we must look to the\njury, and the city juries are very fond of Mr. Chaffanbrass; I am not\nquite sure, however, that Mr. Chaffanbrass was right: I would not have\nadmitted so much myself; but then no one knows a city jury so well as\nMr. Chaffanbrass.'\n\nOther causes came on, and still the jury did not return to court. Mr.\nChaffanbrass seemed to have forgotten the very existence of Alaric\nTudor, and was deeply engaged in vindicating a city butcher from\nan imputation of having vended a dead ass by way of veal. All his\nindignation was now forgotten, and he was full of boisterous fun,\nfilling the court with peals of laughter. One o'clock came, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven, and still no verdict. At the latter hour, when\nthe court was about to be adjourned, the foreman came in, and assured\nthe judge that there was no probability that they could agree; eleven of\nthem thought one way, while the twelfth was opposed to them. 'You must\nreason with the gentleman,' said the judge. 'I have, my lord,' said the\nforeman, 'but it's all thrown away upon him.' 'Reason with him again,'\nsaid the judge, rising from his bench and preparing to go to his dinner.\n\nAnd then one of the great fundamental supports of the British\nconstitution was brought into play. Reason was thrown away upon this\ntough juryman, and, therefore, it was necessary to ascertain what effect\nstarvation might have upon him. A verdict, that is, a unanimous decision\nfrom these twelve men as to Alaric's guilt, was necessary; it might be\nthat three would think him innocent, and nine guilty, or that any other\ndivision of opinion might take place; but such divisions among a jury\nare opposed to the spirit of the British constitution. Twelve men must\nthink alike; or, if they will not, they must be made to do so. 'Reason\nwith him again,' said the judge, as he went to his own dinner. Had the\njudge bade them remind him how hungry he would soon be if he remained\nobstinate, his lordship would probably have expressed the thought which\nwas passing through his mind. 'There is one of us, my lord,' said the\nforeman, 'who will I know be very ill before long; he is already so bad\nthat he can't sit upright.'\n\nThere are many ludicrous points in our blessed constitution, but perhaps\nnothing so ludicrous as a juryman praying to a judge for mercy. He has\nbeen caught, shut up in a box, perhaps, for five or six days together,\nbadgered with half a dozen lawyers till he is nearly deaf with their\ncontinual talking, and then he is locked up until he shall die or find a\nverdict. Such at least is the intention of the constitution. The death,\nhowever, of three or four jurymen from starvation would not suit the\nhumanity of the present age, and therefore, when extremities are nigh\nat hand, the dying jurymen, with medical certificates, are allowed to\nbe carried off. It is devoutly to be wished that one juryman might be\nstarved to death while thus serving the constitution; the absurdity then\nwould cure itself, and a verdict of a majority would be taken.\n\nBut in Alaric's case, reason or hunger did prevail at the last moment,\nand as the judge was leaving the court, he was called back to\nreceive the verdict. Alaric, also, was brought back, still under Mr.\nGitemthruet's wing, and with him came Charley. A few officers of\nthe court were there, a jailer and a policeman or two, those whose\nattendance was absolutely necessary, but with these exceptions the place\nwas empty. Not long since men were crowding for seats, and the policemen\nwere hardly able to restrain the pressure of those who pushed forward;\nbut now there was no pushing; the dingy, dirty benches, a few inches of\nwhich had lately been so desirable, were not at all in request, and were\nanything but inviting in appearance; Alaric sat himself down on the\nvery spot which had lately been sacred to Mr. Chaffanbrass, and Mr.\nGitemthruet, seated above him, might also fancy himself a barrister.\nThere they sat for five minutes in perfect silence; the suspense of the\nmoment cowed even the attorney, and Charley, who sat on the other side\nof Alaric, was so affected that he could hardly have spoken had he\nwished to do so.\n\nAnd then the judge, who had been obliged to re-array himself before he\nreturned to the bench, again took his seat, and an officer of the court\ninquired of the foreman of the jury, in his usual official language,\nwhat their finding was.\n\n'Guilty on the third count,' said the foreman. 'Not guilty on the four\nothers. We beg, however, most strongly to recommend the prisoner to your\nlordship's merciful consideration, believing that he has been led into\nthis crime by one who has been much more guilty than himself.'\n\n'I knew Mr. Chaffanbrass was wrong,' said Mr. Gitemthruet. 'I knew he\nwas wrong when he acknowledged so much. God bless my soul! in a court of\nlaw one should never acknowledge anything! what's the use?'\n\nAnd then came the sentence. He was to be confined at the Penitentiary\nat Millbank for six months. 'The offence,' said the judge, 'of which\nyou have been found guilty, and of which you most certainly have been\nguilty, is one most prejudicial to the interests of the community. That\ntrust which the weaker of mankind should place in the stronger, that\nreliance which widows and orphans should feel in their nearest and\ndearest friends, would be destroyed, if such crimes as these were\nallowed to pass unpunished. But in your case there are circumstances\nwhich do doubtless palliate the crime of which you have been guilty; the\nmoney which you took will, I believe, be restored; the trust which you\nwere courted to undertake should not have been imposed on you; and in\nthe tale of villany which has been laid before us, you have by no\nmeans been the worst offender. I have, therefore, inflicted on you the\nslightest penalty which the law allows me. Mr. Tudor, I know what\nhas been your career, how great your services to your country, how\nunexceptionable your conduct as a public servant; I trust, I do trust, I\nmost earnestly, most hopefully trust, that your career of utility is not\nover. Your abilities are great, and you are blessed with the power\nof thinking; I do beseech you to consider, while you undergo that\nconfinement which you needs must suffer, how little any wealth is worth\nan uneasy conscience.'\n\nAnd so the trial was over. Alaric was taken off in custody; the\npoliceman in mufti was released from his attendance; and Charley, with a\nheavy heart, carried the news to Gertrude and Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'And as for me,' said Gertrude, when she had so far recovered from the\nfirst shock as to be able to talk to her mother--'as for me, I will have\nlodgings at Millbank.'\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nA PARTING INTERVIEW\n\n\nMrs. Woodward remained with her eldest daughter for two days after the\ntrial, and then she was forced to return to Hampton. She had earnestly\nentreated Gertrude to accompany her, with her child; but Mrs. Tudor was\ninflexible. She had, she said, very much to do; so much, that she could\nnot possibly leave London; the house and furniture were on her hands,\nand must be disposed of; their future plans must be arranged; and\nthen nothing, she said, should induce her to sleep out of sight of her\nhusband's prison, or to omit any opportunity of seeing him which the\nprison rules would allow her.\n\nMrs. Woodward would not have left one child in such extremity, had\nnot the state of another child made her presence at the Cottage\nindispensable. Katie's anxiety about the trial had of course been\nintense, so intense as to give her a false strength, and somewhat to\ndeceive Linda as to her real state. Tidings of course passed daily\nbetween London and the Cottage, but for three days they told nothing. On\nthe morning of the fourth day, however, Norman brought the heavy news,\nand Katie sank completely under it. When she first heard the result\nof the trial she swooned away, and remained for some time nearly\nunconscious. But returning consciousness brought with it no relief, and\nshe lay sobbing on her pillow, till she became so weak, that Linda in\nher fright wrote up to her mother begging her to return at once. Then,\nwretched as it made her to leave Gertrude in her trouble, Mrs. Woodward\ndid return.\n\nFor a fortnight after this there was an unhappy household at Surbiton\nCottage. Linda's marriage was put off till the period of Alaric's\nsentence should be over, and till something should be settled as to his\nand Gertrude's future career. It was now August, and they spoke of the\nevent as one which perhaps might occur in the course of the following\nspring. At this time, also, they were deprived for a while of the\ncomfort of Norman's visits by his enforced absence at Normansgrove.\nHarry's eldest brother was again ill, and at last the news of his death\nwas received at Hampton. Under other circumstances such tidings as those\nmight, to a certain extent, have brought their own consolation with\nthem. Harry would now be Mr. Norman of Normansgrove, and Linda would\nbecome Mrs. Norman of Normansgrove; Harry's mother had long been dead,\nand his father was an infirm old man, who would be too glad to give up\nto his son the full management of the estate, now that the eldest son\nwas a man to whom that estate could be trusted. All those circumstances\nhad, of course, been talked over between Harry and Linda, and it was\nunderstood that Harry was now to resign his situation at the Weights\nand Measures. But Alaric's condition, Gertrude's misery, and Katie's\nillness, threw all such matters into the background. Katie became no\nbetter; but then the doctors said that she did not become any worse, and\ngave it as their opinion that she ought to recover. She had youth, they\nsaid, on her side; and then her lungs were not affected. This was the\ngreat question which they were all asking of each other continually. The\npoor girl lived beneath a stethoscope, and bore all their pokings and\ntappings with exquisite patience. She herself believed that she was\ndying, and so she repeatedly told her mother. Mrs. Woodward could\nonly say that all was in God's hands, but that the physicians still\nencouraged them to hope the best.\n\nOne day Mrs. Woodward was sitting with a book in her usual place at the\nside of Katie's bed; she looked every now and again at her patient, and\nthought that she was slumbering; and at last she rose from her chair to\ncreep away, so sure was she that she might be spared for a moment. But\njust as she was silently rising, a thin, slight, pale hand crept out\nfrom beneath the clothes, and laid itself on her arm.\n\n'I thought you were asleep, love,' said she.\n\n'No, mamma, I was not asleep. I was thinking of something. Don't go\naway, mamma, just now. I want to ask you something.'\n\nMrs. Woodward again sat down, and taking her daughter's hand in her own,\ncaressed it.\n\n'I want to ask a favour of you, mamma,' said Katie.\n\n'A favour, my darling! what is it? you know I will do anything in my\npower that you ask me.'\n\n'Ah, mamma, I do not know whether you will do this.'\n\n'What is it, Katie? I will do anything that is for your good. I am sure\nyou know that, Katie.'\n\n'Mamma, I know I am going to die. Oh, mamma, don't say anything now,\ndon't cry now--dear, dear mamma; I don't say it to make you unhappy;\nbut you know when I am so ill I ought to think about it, ought I not,\nmamma?'\n\n'But, Katie, the doctor says that he thinks you are not so dangerously\nill; you should not, therefore, despond; it will increase your illness,\nand hinder your chance of getting well. That would be wrong, wouldn't\nit, love?'\n\n'Mamma, I feel that I shall never again be well, and therefore--' It was\nuseless telling Mrs. Woodward not to cry; what else could she do? 'Dear\nmamma, I am so sorry to make you unhappy, but you are my own mamma, and\ntherefore I must tell you. I can be happy still, mamma, if you will let\nme talk to you about it.'\n\n'You shall talk, dearest; I will hear what you say; but oh, Katie, I\ncannot bear to hear you talk of dying. I do not think you are dying. If\nI did think so, my child, my trust in your goodness is so strong that I\nshould tell you.'\n\n'You know, mamma, it might have been much worse; suppose I had been\ndrowned, when he, when Charley, you know, saved me;' and as she\nmentioned his name a tear for the first time ran down each cheek; 'how\nmuch worse that would have been! think, mamma, what it would be to be\ndrowned without a moment for one's prayers.'\n\n'It is quite right we should prepare ourselves for death. Whether we\nlive, or whether we die, we shall be better for doing that.'\n\nKatie still held her mother's hand in hers, and lay back against the\npillows which had been placed behind her back. 'And now, mamma,' she\nsaid at last, 'I am going to ask you this favour--I want to see Charley\nonce more.'\n\nMrs. Woodward was so much astonished at the request that at first she\nknew not what answer to make. 'To see Charley!' she said at last.\n\n'Yes, mamma; I want to see Charley once more; there need be no secrets\nbetween us now, mamma.'\n\n'There have never been any secrets between us,' said Mrs. Woodward,\nembracing her. 'You have never had any secrets from me?'\n\n'Not intentionally, mamma; I have never meant to keep anything secret\nfrom you. And I know you have known what I felt about Charley.'\n\n'I know that you have behaved like an angel, my child; I know your want\nof selfishness, your devotion to others, has been such as to shame me; I\nknow your conduct has been perfect: oh, my Katie, I have understood it,\nand I have so loved you, so admired you.'\n\nKatie smiled through her tears as she returned her mother's embrace.\n'Well, mamma,' she said, 'at any rate you know that I love him. Oh,\nmamma, I do love him so dearly. It is not now like Gertrude's love, or\nLinda's. I know that I can never be his wife. I did know before, that\nfor many reasons I ought not to wish to be so; but now I know I never,\nnever can be.'\n\nMrs. Woodward was past the power of speaking, and so Katie went on.\n\n'But I do not love him the less for that reason; I think I love him the\nmore. I never, never, could have loved anyone else, mamma; never, never;\nand that is one reason why I do not so much mind being ill now.'\n\nMrs. Woodward bowed forward, and hid her face in the counterpane, but\nshe still kept hold of her daughter's hand.\n\n'And, mamma,' she continued, 'as I do love him so dearly, I feel that\nI should try to do something for him. I ought to do so; and, mamma, I\ncould not be happy without seeing him. He is not just like a brother\nor a brother-in-law, such as Harry and Alaric; we are not bound to each\nother as relations are; but yet I feel that something does bind me to\nhim. I know he doesn't love me as I love him; but yet I think he loves\nme dearly; and if I speak to him now, mamma, now that I am--that I am so\nill, perhaps he will mind me. Mamma, it will be as though one came unto\nhim from the dead.'\n\nMrs. Woodward did not know how to refuse any request that Katie might\nnow make to her, and felt herself altogether unequal to the task of\nrefusing this request. For many reasons she would have done so, had\nshe been able; in the first place she did not think that all chance of\nKatie's recovery was gone; and then at the present moment she felt no\ninclination to draw closer to her any of the Tudor family. She could not\nbut feel that Alaric had been the means of disgracing and degrading one\nchild; and truly, deeply, warmly, as she sympathized with the other, she\ncould not bring herself to feel the same sympathy for the object of her\nlove. It was a sore day for her and hers, that on which the Tudors had\nfirst entered her house.\n\nNevertheless she assented to Katie's proposal, and undertook the task of\nasking Charley down to Hampton.\n\nSince Alaric's conviction Charley led a busy life; and as men who have\nreally something to do have seldom time to get into much mischief, he\nhad been peculiarly moral and respectable. It is not surprising that at\nsuch a moment Gertrude found that Alaric's newer friends fell off\nfrom him. Of course they did; nor is it a sign of ingratitude or\nheartlessness in the world that at such a period of great distress new\nfriends should fall off. New friends, like one's best coat and polished\npatent-leather dress boots, are only intended for holiday wear. At other\ntimes they are neither serviceable nor comfortable; they do not answer\nthe required purposes, and are ill adapted to give us the ease we seek.\nA new coat, however, has this advantage, that it will in time become old\nand comfortable; so much can by no means be predicted with certainty of\na new friend. Woe to those men who go through the world with none but\nnew coats on their backs, with no boots but those of polished leather,\nwith none but new friends to comfort them in adversity.\n\nBut not the less, when misfortune does come, are we inclined to grumble\nat finding ourselves deserted. Gertrude, though she certainly wished to\nsee no Mrs. Val and no Miss Neverbends, did feel lonely enough when\nher mother left her, and wretched enough. But she was not altogether\ndeserted. At this time Charley was true to her, and did for her all\nthose thousand nameless things which a woman cannot do for herself.\nHe came to her everyday after leaving his office, and on one excuse or\nanother remained with her till late every evening.\n\nHe was not a little surprised one morning on receiving Mrs. Woodward's\ninvitation to Hampton. Mrs. Woodward in writing had had some difficulty\nin wording her request. She hardly liked asking Charley to come because\nKatie was ill; nor did she like to ask him without mentioning Katie's\nillness. 'I need not explain to you,' she said in her note, 'that we are\nall in great distress; poor Katie is very ill, and you will understand\nwhat we must feel about Alaric and Gertrude. Harry is still at\nNormansgrove. We shall all be glad to see you, and Katie, who never\nforgets what you did for her, insists on my asking you at once. I am\nsure you will not refuse her, so I shall expect you to-morrow.' Charley\nwould not have refused her anything, and it need hardly be said that he\naccepted the invitation.\n\nMrs. Woodward was at a loss how to receive him, or what to say to him.\nThough Katie was so positive that her own illness would be fatal--a\nsymptom which might have confirmed those who watched her in their\nopinion that her disease was not consumption--her mother was by no means\nso desponding. She still thought it not impossible that her child might\nrecover, and so thinking could not but be adverse to any declaration on\nKatie's part of her own feelings. She had endeavoured to explain this\nto her daughter; but Katie was so carried away by her enthusiasm, was\nat the present moment so devoted, and, as it were, exalted above her\npresent life, that all that her mother said was thrown away upon her.\nMrs. Woodward might have refused her daughter's request, and have run\nthe risk of breaking her heart by the refusal; but now that the petition\nhad been granted, it was useless to endeavour to teach her to repress\nher feelings.\n\n'Charley,' said Mrs. Woodward, when he had been some little time in the\nhouse, 'our dear Katie wants to see you; she is very ill, you know.'\n\nCharley said he knew she was ill.\n\n'You remember our walk together, Charley.'\n\n'Yes,' said Charley, 'I remember it well. I made you a promise then, and\nI have kept it. I have now come here only because you have sent for me.'\nThis he said in the tone which a man uses when he feels himself to have\nbeen injured.\n\n'I know it, Charley; you have kept your promise; I knew you would, and\nI know you will. I have the fullest trust in you; and now you shall come\nand see her.'\n\nCharley was to return to town that night, and they had not therefore\nmuch time to lose; they went upstairs at once, and found Linda and\nUncle Bat in the patient's room. It was a lovely August evening, and the\nbedroom window opening upon the river was unclosed. Katie, as she sat\npropped up against the pillows, could look out upon the water and see\nthe reedy island, on which in happy former days she had so delighted to\nlet her imagination revel.\n\n'It is very good of you to come and see me, Charley,' said she, as he\nmade his way up to her bedside.\n\nHe took her wasted hand in his own and pressed it, and, as he did so, a\ntear forced itself into each corner of his eyes. She smiled as though to\ncheer him, and said that now she saw him she could be quite happy, only\nfor poor Alaric and Gertrude. She hoped she might live to see Alaric\nagain; but if not, Charley was to give him her best-best love.\n\n'Live to see him! of course you will,' said Uncle Bat.\n\n'What's to hinder you?' Uncle Bat, like the rest of them, tried to cheer\nher, and make her think that she might yet live.\n\nAfter a while Uncle Bat went out of the room, and Linda followed him.\nMrs. Woodward would fain have remained, but she perfectly understood\nthat it was part of the intended arrangement with Katie, that Charley\nshould be alone with her. 'I will come back in a quarter of an hour,'\nshe said, rising to follow the others. 'You must not let her talk too\nmuch, Charley: you see how weak she is.'\n\n'Mamma, when you come, knock at the door, will you?' said Katie. Mrs.\nWoodward, who found herself obliged to act in complete obedience to her\ndaughter, promised that she would; and then they were left alone.\n\n'Sit down, Charley,' said she; he was still standing by her bedside,\nand now at her bidding he sat in the chair which Captain Cuttwater\nhad occupied. 'Come here nearer to me,' said she; 'this is where mamma\nalways sits, and Linda when mamma is not here.' Charley did as he was\nbid, and, changing his seat, came and sat down close to her bed-head.\n\n'Charley, do you remember how you went into the water for me?' said she,\nagain smiling, and pulling her hand out and resting it on his arm which\nlay on the bed beside her.\n\n'Indeed I do, Katie--I remember the day very well.'\n\n'That was a very happy day in spite of the tumble, was it not, Charley?\nAnd do you remember the flower-show, and the dance at Mrs. Val's?'\n\nCharley did remember them all well. Ah me! how often had he thought of\nthem!\n\n'I think of those days so often--too often,' continued Katie. 'But, dear\nCharley, I cannot remember too often that you saved my life.'\n\nCharley once more tried to explain to her that there was nothing worthy\nof notice in his exploit of that day.\n\n'Well, Charley, I may think as I like, you know,' she said, with\nsomething of the obstinacy of old days. 'I think you did save my life,\nand all the people in the world won't make me think anything else; but,\nCharley, I have something now to tell you.'\n\nHe sat and listened. It seemed to him as though he were only there\nto listen; as though, were he to make his own voice audible, he would\nviolate the sanctity of the place. His thoughts were serious enough,\nbut he could not pitch his voice so as to suit the tone in which she\naddressed him.\n\n'We were always friends, were we not?' said she; 'we were always good\nfriends, Charley. Do you remember how you were to build a palace for me\nin the dear old island out there? You were always so kind, so good to\nme.'\n\nCharley said he remembered it all--they were happy days; the happiest\ndays, he said, that he had ever known.\n\n'And you used to love me, Charley?'\n\n'Used!' said he, 'do you think I do not love you now?'\n\n'I am sure you do. And, Charley, I love you also. That it is that I want\nto tell you. I love you so well that I cannot go away from this world\nin peace without wishing you farewell. Charley, if you love me, you will\nthink of me when I am gone; and then for my sake you will be steady.'\n\nHere were all her old words over again--'You will be steady, won't you,\nCharley? I know you will be steady, now.' How much must she have thought\nof him! How often must his career have caused her misery and pain! How\nladen must that innocent bosom have been with anxiety on his account!\nHe had promised her then that he would reform; but he had broken his\npromise. He now promised her again, but how could he hope that she would\nbelieve him?\n\n'You know how ill I am, don't you? You know that I am dying, Charley?'\n\nCharley of course declared that he still hoped that she would recover.\n\n'If I thought so,' said she, 'I should not say what I am now saying; but\nI feel that I may tell the truth. Dear Charley, dearest Charley, I love\nyou with all my heart--I do not know how it came so; I believe I have\nalways loved you since I first knew you; I used to think it was because\nyou saved my life; but I know it was not that. I was so glad it was you\nthat came to me in the water, and not Harry; so that I know I loved you\nbefore that.'\n\n'Dear Katie, you have not loved me, or thought of me, more than I have\nloved and thought of you.'\n\n'Ah, Charley,' she said, smiling in her sad sweet way--'I don't think\nyou know how a girl can love; you have so many things to think of, so\nmuch to amuse you up in London; you don't know what it is to think of\none person for days and days, and nights and nights together. That is\nthe way I have thought of you, I don't think there can be any harm,' she\ncontinued, 'in loving a person as I have loved you. Indeed, how could I\nhelp it? I did not love you on purpose. But I think I should be wrong\nto die without telling you. When I am dead, Charley, will you think of\nthis, and try--try to give up your bad ways? When I tell you that I love\nyou so dearly, and ask you on my deathbed, I think you will do this.'\n\nCharley went down on his knees, and bowing his head before her and\nbefore his God, he made the promise. He made it, and we may so far\nanticipate the approaching end of our story as to declare that the\npromise he then made was faithfully kept.\n\n'Katie, Katie, my own Katie, my own, own, own Katie--oh, Katie, you must\nnot die, you must not leave me! Oh, Katie, I have so dearly loved you!\nOh, Katie, I do so dearly love you! If you knew all, if you could know\nall, you would believe me.'\n\nAt this moment Mrs. Woodward knocked at the door, and Charley rose from\nhis knees. 'Not quite yet, mamma,' said Katie, as Mrs. Woodward opened\nthe door. 'Not quite yet; in five minutes, mamma, you may come.' Mrs.\nWoodward, not knowing how to refuse, again went away.\n\n'Charley, I never gave you anything but once, and you returned it to me,\ndid you not?'\n\n'Yes,' said he, 'the purse--I put it in your box, because----'\n\nAnd then he remembered that he could not say why he had returned it\nwithout breaking in a manner that confidence which Mrs. Woodward had put\nin him.\n\n'I understand it all. You must not think I am angry with you. I know how\ngood you were about it. But Charley, you may have it back now; here it\nis;' and putting her hand under the pillow, she took it out, carefully\nfolded up in new tissue paper. 'There, Charley, you must never part with\nit again as long as there are two threads of it together; but I know\nyou never will; and Charley, you must never talk of it to anybody but to\nyour wife; and you must tell her all about it.'\n\nHe took the purse, and put it to his lips, and then pressed it to his\nheart. 'No,' said he, 'I will never part with it again. I think I can\npromise that.' 'And now, dearest, good-bye,' said she; 'dearest, dearest\nCharley, good-bye; perhaps we shall know each other in heaven. Kiss me,\nCharley, before you go,' So he stooped down over her, and pressed his\nlips to hers.\n\nCharley, leaving the room, found Mrs. Woodward at the other end of the\npassage, standing at the door of her own dressing-room. 'You are to go\nto her now,' he said. 'Good-bye,' and without further speech to any of\nthem he hurried out of the house.\n\nNone but Mrs. Woodward had seen him; but she saw that the tears were\nstreaming down his cheeks as he passed her, and she expressed no\nsurprise that he had left the Cottage without going through the\nformality of making his adieux.\n\nAnd then he walked up to town, as Norman once had done after a parting\ninterview with her whom he had loved. It might be difficult to say which\nat the moment suffered the bitterest grief.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nMILLBANK\n\n\nThe immediate neighbourhood of Millbank Penitentiary is not one which we\nshould, for its own sake, choose for our residence, either on account of\nits natural beauty, or the excellence of its habitations. That it is\na salubrious locality must be presumed from the fact that it has been\nselected for the site of the institution in question; but salubrity,\nthough doubtless a great recommendation, would hardly reconcile us to\nthe extremely dull, and one might almost say, ugly aspect which this\ndistrict bears.\n\nTo this district, however, ugly as it is, we must ask our readers\nto accompany us, while we pay a short visit to poor Gertrude. It\nwas certainly a sad change from her comfortable nursery and elegant\ndrawing-room near Hyde Park. Gertrude had hitherto never lived in an\nugly house. Surbiton Cottage and Albany Place were the only two homes\nthat she remembered, and neither of them was such as to give her much\nfitting preparation for the melancholy shelter which she found at No. 5,\nParadise Row, Millbank.\n\nBut Gertrude did not think much of this when she changed her residence.\nEarly one morning, leaning on Charley's arm, she had trudged down across\nthe Park, through Westminster, and on to the close vicinity of the\nprison; and here they sought for and obtained such accommodation as she\nthought fitting to her present situation. Charley had begged her to get\ninto a cab, and when she refused that, had implored her to indulge in\nthe luxury of an omnibus; but Gertrude's mind was now set upon economy;\nshe would come back, she said, in an omnibus when the day would be\nhotter, and she would be alone, but she was very well able to walk the\ndistance once.\n\nShe procured, for seven shillings a week, a sitting-room and bedroom,\nfrom whence she could see the gloomy prison walls, and also a\ntruckle-bed for the young girl whom she was to bring with her as her\nmaid. This was a little Hampton maiden, whom she had brought from the\ncountry to act as fag and deputy to her grand nurse; but the grand nurse\nwas now gone, and the fag was promoted to the various offices of nurse,\nlady's-maid, and parlour servant. The rest of the household in Albany\nPlace had already dispersed with the discreet view of bettering their\nsituations.\n\nEverything in the house was given up to pay what Alaric owed.\nIndependently of his dreadful liability to Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe, he could\nnot have been said to be in debt; but still, like most other men who\nlive as he had done, when his career was thus brought to a sudden close,\nit was found that there were many people looking for money. There were\nlittle bills, as the owners said of them, which had been forgotten,\nof course, on account of their insignificance, but which being so very\nlittle might now be paid, equally of course, without any trouble. It is\nastonishing how easy it is to accumulate three or four hundred pounds'\nworth of little bills, when one lives before the world in a good house\nand in visible possession of a good income.\n\nAt the moment of Alaric's conviction, there was but a slender stock of\nmoney forthcoming for these little bills. The necessary expense of his\ntrial,--and it had been by no means trifling,--he had, of course, been\nobliged to pay. His salary had been suspended, and all the money that\nhe could lay his hands on had been given up towards making restitution\ntowards the dreadful sum of \u00c2\u00a320,000 that had been his ruin. The bills,\nhowever, did not come in till after his trial, and then there was but\nlittle left but the furniture.\n\nAs the new trustees employed on behalf of Madame Jaqu\u00c3\u00aatan\u00c3\u00a0pe and\nMr. Figgs were well aware that they had much more to expect from\nthe generosity of Tudor's friends than from any legal seizure of his\nproperty, they did not interfere in the disposal of the chairs and\ntables. But not on that account did Gertrude conceive herself entitled\nto make any use on her own behalf of such money as might come into her\nhands. The bills should be paid, and then every farthing that could be\ncollected should be given towards lessening the deficiency. Six thousand\npounds had already been made up by the joint efforts of Norman and\nCaptain Cuttwater. Undy Scott's acknowledgement for the other four\nthousand had been offered, but the new trustees declined to accept it as\nof any value whatsoever. They were equally incredulous as to the bridge\nshares, which from that day to this have never held up their heads, even\nto the modest height of half a crown a share.\n\nGertrude's efforts to make the most of everything had been unceasing.\nWhen her husband was sentenced, she had in her possession a new dress\nand some finery for her baby, which were not yet paid for; these she\ntook back with her own hand, offering to the milliners her own trinkets\nby way of compensation for their loss. When the day for removal came,\nshe took with her nothing that she imagined could be sold. She would\nhave left the grander part of her own wardrobe, if the auctioneers\nwould have undertaken to sell it. Some few things, books and trifling\nhousehold articles, which she thought were dear to Alaric, she packed\nup; and such were sent to Hampton. On the day of her departure she\ndressed herself in a plain dark gown, one that was almost mourning,\nand then, with her baby in her lap, and her young maid beside her, and\nCharley fronting her in the cab, she started for her new home.\n\nI had almost said that her pride had left her. Such an assertion would\nbe a gross libel on her. No; she was perhaps prouder than ever, as she\nleft her old home. There was a humility in her cheap dress, in her large\nstraw bonnet coming far over her face, in her dark gloves and little\nsimple collar; nay, there was a humility in her altered voice, and\nsomewhat chastened mien; but the spirit of the woman was wholly\nunbroken. She had even a pride in her very position, in her close and\ndear tie with the convicted prisoner. She was his for better and for\nworse; she would now show him what was her idea of the vow she had\nmade. To the men who came to ticket and number the furniture, to the\ntradesmen's messengers who called for money, to the various workmen with\nwhom the house was then invaded, she was humble enough; but had Mrs. Val\ncome across her with pity, or the Miss Neverbends with their sententious\ntwaddlings, she would have been prouder than ever. Fallen indeed!\nShe had had no fall; nor had he; he was still a man, with a greater\naggregate of good in him than falls to the average lot of mortals. Who\nwould dare to tell her that he had fallen? 'Twas thus that her pride was\nstill strong within her; and as it supported her through this misery,\nwho can blame her for it?\n\nShe was allowed into the prison twice a week; on Tuesdays and Fridays\nshe was permitted to spend one hour with her husband, and to take her\nchild with her. It is hardly necessary to say that she was punctual to\nthe appointed times. This, however, occupied but a short period, even\nof those looked-for days; and in spite of her pride, and her constant\nneedle, the weary six months went from her all too slowly.\n\nNor did they pass with swifter foot within the prison. Alaric was\nallowed the use of books and pens and paper, but even with these he\nfound a day in prison to be almost an unendurable eternity. This was the\nreal punishment of his guilt; it was not that he could not eat well,\nand lie soft, or enjoy the comforts which had always surrounded him;\nbut that the day would not pass away. The slowness of the lagging hours\nnearly drove him mad. He made a thousand resolutions as to reading,\nwriting, and employment for his mind. He attempted to learn whole pages\nby rote, and to fatigue himself to rest by exercise of his memory. But\nhis memory would not work; his mind would continue idle; he was impotent\nover his own faculties. Oh, if he could only sleep while these horrid\nweeks were passing over him!\n\nAll hope of regaining his situation had of course passed from him, all\nhope of employment in England. Emigration must now be his lot; and hers\nalso, and the lot of that young one that was already born to them, and\nof that other one who was, alas! now coming to the world, whose fate\nit would be first to see the light under the walls of its father's\nprison.--Yes, they must emigrate.--But there was nothing so very\nterrible in that. Alaric felt that even his utter poverty would be no\nmisfortune if only his captivity were over. Poverty!--how could any man\nbe poor who had liberty to roam the world?\n\nWe all of us acknowledge that the educated man who breaks the laws\nis justly liable to a heavier punishment than he who has been born\nin ignorance, and bred, as it were, in the lap of sin; but we hardly\nrealize how much greater is the punishment which, when he be punished,\nthe educated man is forced to undergo. Confinement to the man whose mind\nhas never been lifted above vacancy is simply remission from labour.\nConfinement, with labour, is simply the enforcement of that which has\nhitherto been his daily lot. But what must a prison be to him whose\nintellect has received the polish of the world's poetry, who has known\nwhat it is to feed more than the belly, to require other aliment than\nbread and meat?\n\nAnd then, what does the poor criminal lose? His all, it will be said;\nand the rich can lose no more. But this is not so. No man loses his\nall by any sentence which a human judge can inflict. No man so loses\nanything approaching to his all, however much he may have lost before.\nBut the one man has too often had no self-respect to risk; the other\nhas stood high in his own esteem, has held his head proudly before\nthe world, has aspired to walk in some way after the fashion of a god.\nAlaric had so aspired, and how must he have felt during those prison\ndays! Of what nature must his thoughts have been when they turned to\nGertrude and his child! His sin had indeed been heavy, and heavy was\nthe penalty which he suffered. When they had been thus living for about\nthree months, Gertrude's second child was born. Mrs. Woodward was with\nher at the time, and she had suffered but little except that for three\nweeks she was unable to see her husband; then, in the teeth of all\ncounsel, and in opposition to all medical warning, she could resist no\nlonger, and carried the newborn stranger to his father.\n\n'Poor little wretch!' said Alaric, as he stooped to kiss him.\n\n'Wretch!' said Gertrude, looking up to him with a smile upon her\nface--'he is no wretch. He is a sturdy little man, that shall yet live\nto make your heart dance with joy.'\n\nMrs. Woodward came often to see her. She did not stay, for there was\nno bed in which she could have slept; but the train put her down at\nVauxhall, and she had but to pass the bridge, and she was close to\nGertrude's lodgings. And now the six months had nearly gone by, when, by\nappointment, she brought Norman with her. At this time he had given\nup his clerkship at the Weights and Measures, and was about to go to\nNormansgrove for the remainder of the winter. Both Alaric and Norman had\nshown a great distaste to meet each other. But Harry's heart softened\ntowards Gertrude. Her conduct during her husband's troubles had been\nso excellent, that he could not but forgive her the injuries which he\nfancied he owed to her.\n\nEverything was now prepared for their departure. They were to sail\non the very day after Alaric's liberation, so as to save him from the\nmisery of meeting those who might know him. And now Harry came with Mrs.\nWoodward to bid farewell, probably for ever on this side the grave, to\nher whom he had once looked on as his own. How different were their lots\nnow! Harry was Mr. Norman of Normansgrove, immediately about to take his\nplace as the squire of his parish, to sit among brother magistrates, to\ndecide about roads and poachers, parish rates and other all-absorbing\ntopics, to be a rural magistrate, and fill a place among perhaps the\nmost fortunate of the world's inhabitants. Gertrude was the wife of a\nconvicted felon, who was about to come forth from his prison in utter\npoverty, a man who, in such a catalogue as the world makes of its\ninhabitants, would be ranked among the very lowest.\n\nAnd did Gertrude even now regret her choice? No, not for a moment! She\nstill felt certain in her heart of hearts that she had loved the one who\nwas the most worthy of a woman's love. We cannot, probably, all agree in\nher opinion; but we will agree in this, at least, that she was now right\nto hold such opinion. Had Normansgrove stretched from one boundary of\nthe county to the other, it would have weighed as nothing. Had Harry's\nvirtues been as bright as burnished gold--and indeed they had been\nbright--they would have weighed as nothing. A nobler stamp of manhood\nwas on her husband--so at least Gertrude felt;--and manhood is the one\nvirtue which in a woman's breast outweighs all others.\n\nThey had not met since the evening on which Gertrude had declared to him\nthat she never could love him; and Norman, as he got out of the cab with\nMrs. Woodward, at No. 5, Paradise Row, Millbank, felt his heart beat\nwithin him almost as strongly as he had done when he was about to\npropose to her. He followed Mrs. Woodward into the dingy little house,\nand immediately found himself in Gertrude's presence.\n\nI should exaggerate the fact were I to say that he would not have known\nher; but had he met her elsewhere, met her where he did not expect to\nmeet her, he would have looked at her more than once before he felt\nassured that he was looking at Gertrude Woodward. It was not that she\nhad grown pale, or worn, or haggard; though, indeed, her face had on it\nthat weighty look of endurance which care will always give; it was not\nthat she had lost her beauty, and become unattractive in his eyes; but\nthat the whole nature of her mien and form, the very trick of her gait\nwas changed. Her eye was as bright as ever, but it was steady, composed,\nand resolved; her lips were set and compressed, and there was no\nplayfulness round her mouth. Her hair was still smooth and bright, but\nit was more brushed off from her temples than it had been of yore, and\nwas partly covered by a bit of black lace, which we presume we must call\na cap; here and there, too, through it, Norman's quick eye detected\na few grey hairs. She was stouter too than she had been, or else she\nseemed to be so from the changes in her dress. Her step fell heavier\non the floor than it used to do, and her voice was quicker and more\ndecisive in its tones. When she spoke to her mother, she did so as\none sister might do to another; and, indeed, Mrs. Woodward seemed to\nexercise over her very little of the authority of a parent. The truth\nwas that Gertrude had altogether ceased to be a girl, had altogether\nbecome a woman. Linda, with whom Norman at once compared her, though but\none year younger, was still a child in comparison with her elder sister.\nHappy, happy Linda!\n\nGertrude had certainly proved herself to be an excellent wife; but\nperhaps she might have made herself more pleasing to others if she had\nnot so entirely thrown off from herself all traces of juvenility. Could\nshe, in this respect, have taken a lesson from her mother, she would\nhave been a wiser woman. We have said that she consorted with Mrs.\nWoodward as though they had been sisters; but one might have said that\nGertrude took on herself the manners of the elder sister. It is true\nthat she had hard duties to perform, a stern world to overcome, an\nuphill fight before her with poverty, distress, and almost, nay,\nabsolutely, with degradation. It was well for her and Alaric that she\ncould face it all with the true courage of an honest woman. But yet\nthose who had known her in her radiant early beauty could not but regret\nthat the young freshness of early years should all have been laid aside\nso soon.\n\n'Linda, at any rate, far exceeds her in beauty,' was Norman's first\nthought, as he stood for a moment to look at her--'and then Linda too is\nso much more feminine.' 'Twas thus that Harry Norman consoled himself in\nthe first moment of his first interview with Alaric's wife. And he was\nright in his thoughts. The world would now have called Linda the more\nlovely of the two, and certainly the more feminine in the ladylike\nsense of the word. If, however, devotion be feminine, and truth to one\nselected life's companion, if motherly care be so, and an indomitable\nsense of the duties due to one's own household, then Gertrude was not\ndeficient in feminine character.\n\n'You find me greatly altered, Harry, do you not?' said she, taking his\nhand frankly, and perceiving immediately the effect which she had made\nupon him. 'I am a steady old matron, am I not?--with a bairn on each\nside of me,' and she pointed to her baby in the cradle, and to her other\nboy sitting on his grandmother's knee.\n\nHarry said he did find her altered. It was her dress, he said, and the\ncap on her head.\n\n'Yes, Harry; and some care and trouble too. To you, you know, to a\nfriend such as you are, I must own that care and trouble do tell upon\none. Not, thank God, that I have more than I can bear; not that I have\nnot blessings for which I cannot but be too thankful.'\n\n'And so these are your boys, Gertrude?'\n\n'Yes,' said she, cheerfully; 'these are the little men, that in the good\ntimes coming will be managing vast kingdoms, and giving orders to this\nworn-out old island of yours. Alley, my boy, sing your new song\nabout the 'good and happy land.' But Alley, who had got hold of his\ngrandmother's watch, and was staring with all his eyes at the stranger,\ndid not seem much inclined to be musical at the present moment.\n\n'And this is Charley's godson,' continued Gertrude, taking up the baby.\n'Dear Charley! he has been such a comfort to me.'\n\n'I have heard all about you daily from him,' said Harry.\n\n'I know you have--and he is daily talking of you, Harry. And so he\nshould do; so we all should do. What a glorious change this is for him!\nis it not, Harry?'\n\nCharley by this time had torn himself away from Mr. Snape and the\nnavvies, and transferred the whole of his official zeal and energies to\nthe Weights and Measures. The manner and reason of this must, however,\nbe explained in a subsequent chapter.\n\n'Yes,' said Harry, 'he has certainly got into a better office.'\n\n'And he will do well there?'\n\n'I am sure he will. It was impossible he should do well at that other\nplace. No man could do so. He is quite an altered man now. The only\nfault I find with him is that he is so full of his heroes and heroines.'\n\n'So he is, Harry; he is always asking me what he is to do with some\nforlorn lady or gentleman, 'Oh, smother her!' I said the other day.\n'Well,' said he, with a melancholy gravity, 'I'll try it; but I fear it\nwon't answer.' Poor Charley! what a friend you have been to him, Harry!'\n\n'A friend!' said Mrs. Woodward, who was still true to her adoration of\nNorman. 'Indeed he has been a friend--a friend to us all. Who is there\nlike him?'\n\nGertrude could have found it in her heart to go back to the subject of\nold days, and tell her mother that there was somebody much better\neven than Harry Norman. But the present was hardly a time for such an\nassertion of her own peculiar opinion.\n\n'Yes, Harry,' she said, 'we have all much, too much, to thank you for. I\nhave to thank you on his account.'\n\n'Oh no,' said he, ungraciously; 'there is nothing to thank me for,--not\non his account. Your mother and Captain Cuttwater----' and then he\nstopped himself. What he meant was that he had sacrificed his little\nfortune--for at the time his elder brother had still been living--not to\nrescue, or in attempting to rescue, his old friend from misfortune--not,\nat least, because that man had been his friend; but because he was the\nhusband of Gertrude Woodward, and of Mrs. Woodward's daughter. Could he\nhave laid bare his heart, he would have declared that Alaric Tudor owed\nhim nothing; that he had never forgiven, never could forgive, the wrongs\nhe had received from him; but that he had forgiven Alaric's wife; and\nthat having done so in the tenderness of his heart, he had been ready to\ngive up all that he possessed for her protection. He would have spared\nGertrude what pain he could; but he would not lie, and speak of Alaric\nTudor with affection.\n\n'But there is, Harry; there is,' said Gertrude; 'much--too much\n--greatly too much. It is that now weighs me down more than anything.\nOh! Harry, how are we to pay to you all this money?'\n\n'It is with Mrs. Woodward,' said he coldly, 'and Captain Cuttwater, not\nwith me, that you should speak of that. Mr. Tudor owes me nothing.'\n\n'Oh, Harry, Harry,' said she, 'do not call him Mr. Tudor--pray, pray;\nnow that we are going--now that we shall never wound your sight again!\ndo not call him Mr. Tudor.\n\nHe has done wrong; I do not deny it; but which of us is there that has\nnot?'\n\n'It was not on that account,' said he; 'I could forgive all that.'\n\nGertrude understood him, and her cheeks and brow became tinged with red.\nIt was not from shame, nor yet wholly from a sense of anger, but mingled\nfeelings filled her heart; feelings which she could in nowise explain.\n'If you have forgiven him that'--she would have said, had she thought it\nright to speak out her mind--'if you have forgiven him that, then there\nis nothing left for further forgiveness.'\n\nGertrude had twice a better knowledge of the world than he had, twice a\nquicker perception of how things were going, and should be made to go.\nShe saw that it was useless to refer further to her husband. Norman had\ncome there at her request to say adieu to her; that she and he, who had\nbeen friends since she was a child, might see each other before they\nwere separated for ever by half a world, and that they might part in\nlove and charity. She would be his sister-in-law, he would be son to her\nmother, husband to her Linda; he had been, though he now denied it, her\nhusband's staunchest friend in his extremity; and it would have added\ngreatly to the bitterness of her departure had she been forced to go\nwithout speaking to him one kindly word. The opportunity was given to\nher, and she would not utterly mar its sweetness by insisting on his\ninjustice to her husband.\n\nThey all remained silent for a while, during which Gertrude fondled her\nbaby, and Norman produced before the elder boy some present that he had\nbrought for him.\n\n'Now, Alley,' said Mrs. Woodward, 'you're a made man; won't that do\nbeautifully to play with on board the big ship?'\n\n'And so, Harry, you have given up official life altogether,' said\nGertrude.\n\n'Yes,' said he--'the last day of the last year saw my finale at the\nWeights and Measures. I did not live long--officially--to enjoy my\npromotion. I almost wish myself back again.'\n\n'You'll go in on melting days, like the retired tallow-chandler,'\nsaid Gertrude; 'but, joking apart, I wish you joy on your freedom from\nthraldom; a government office in England is thraldom. If a man were to\ngive his work only, it would be well. All men who have to live by labour\nmust do that; but a man has to give himself as well as his work;\nto sacrifice his individuality; to become body and soul a part of a\nlumbering old machine.'\n\nThis hardly came well from Gertrude, seeing that Alaric at any rate had\nnever been required to sacrifice any of his individuality. But she was\ndetermined to hate all the antecedents of his life, as though those\nantecedents, and not the laxity of his own principles, had brought about\nhis ruin. She was prepared to live entirely for the future, and to look\nback on her London life as bad, tasteless, and demoralizing. England\nto her was no longer a glorious country; for England's laws had made a\nfelon of her husband. She would go to a new land, new hopes, new ideas,\nnew freedom, new work, new life, and new ambition. 'Excelsior!' there\nwas no longer an excelsior left for talent and perseverance in this\neffete country. She and hers would soon find room for their energies in\na younger land; and as she went she could not but pity those whom she\nleft behind. Her reasoning was hardly logical, but, perhaps, it was not\nunfortunate.\n\n'For myself,' said Norman, not quite following all this--'I always liked\nthe Civil Service, and now I leave it with a sort of regret. I am quite\nglad that Charley has my old desk; it will keep up a sort of tie between\nme and the place.'\n\n'What does Linda say about it, mamma?'\n\n'Linda and I are both of Harry's way of thinking,' said Mrs. Woodward,\n'because Normansgrove is such a distance.'\n\n'Distance!' repeated Gertrude, with something of sorrow, but more of\nscorn in her tone. 'Distance, mamma! why you can get to her between\nbreakfast and dinner. Think where Melbourne is, mamma!'\n\n'It has nearly broken my heart to think of it,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'And you will still have Linda, mamma, and our darling Katie, and Harry,\nand dear Charley. If the idea of distance should frighten anyone it is\nme. But nothing shall frighten me while I have my husband and children.\nHarry, you must not let mamma be too often alone when some other knight\nshall have come and taken away Katie.'\n\n'We will take her to Normansgrove for good and all, if she will let us,'\nsaid Harry.\n\nAnd now the time came for them to part. Harry was to say good-bye\nto her, and then to see her no more. Early on the following morning\nGertrude was to go to Hampton and see Katie for the last time; to see\nKatie for the last time, and the Cottage, and the shining river, and\nall the well-known objects among which she had passed her life. To Mrs.\nWoodward, to Linda, and Katie, all this was subject of inexpressible\nmelancholy; but with Gertrude every feeling of romance seemed to have\nbeen absorbed by the realities of life. She would, of course, go to\nKatie and give her a farewell embrace, since Katie was still too weak to\ncome to her; she would say farewell to Uncle Bat, to whom she and Alaric\nowed so much; she would doubtless shed a tear or two, and feel some\nemotion at parting, even from the inanimate associations of her youth;\nbut all this would now impress no lasting sorrow on her.\n\nShe was eager to be off, eager for her new career, eager that he should\nstand on a soil where he could once more face his fellow-creatures\nwithout shame. She panted to put thousands of leagues of ocean between\nhim and his disgrace.\n\nOn the following morning Gertrude was to go to Hampton for two hours,\nand then to return to Millbank, with her mother and sister, for whose\naccommodation a bed had been hired in the neighbourhood. On that evening\nAlaric would be released from his prison; and then before daybreak on\nthe following day they were to take their way to the far-off docks, and\nplace themselves on board the vessel which was to carry them to their\ndistant home.\n\n'God bless you, Gertrude,' said Norman, whose eyes were not dry.\n\n'God Almighty bless you, Harry, you and Linda--and make you happy. If\nLinda does not write constantly very constantly, you must do it for her.\nWe have delayed the happiness of your marriage, Harry--you must forgive\nus that, as well as all our other trespasses. I fear Linda will never\nforgive that.'\n\n'You won't find her unmerciful on that score,' said he. 'Dear Gertrude,\ngood-bye.'\n\nShe put up her face to him, and he kissed her, for the first time in his\nlife. 'He bade me give you his love,' said she, in her last whisper; 'I\nmust, you know, do his bidding.'\n\nNorman's heart palpitated so that he could hardly compose his voice for\nhis last answer; but even then he would not be untrue to his inexorable\nobstinacy; he could not send his love to a man he did not love. 'Tell\nhim,' said he, 'that he has my sincerest wishes for success wherever\nhe may be; and Gertrude, I need hardly say----' but he could get no\nfurther.\n\nAnd so they parted.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nTHE CRIMINAL POPULATION IS DISPOSED OF\n\n\nBefore we put Alaric on board the ship which is to take him away from\nthe land in which he might have run so exalted a career, we must say\none word as to the fate and fortunes of his old friend Undy Scott.\nThis gentleman has not been represented in our pages as an amiable or\nhigh-minded person. He has indeed been the bad spirit of the tale, the\nSiva of our mythology, the devil that has led our hero into temptation,\nthe incarnation of evil, which it is always necessary that the novelist\nshould have personified in one of his characters to enable him to\nbring about his misfortunes, his tragedies, and various requisite\ncatastrophes. Scott had his Varney and such-like; Dickens his Bill Sykes\nand such-like; all of whom are properly disposed of before the end of\nthose volumes in which are described their respective careers.\n\nI have ventured to introduce to my readers, as my devil, Mr. Undy Scott,\nM.P. for the Tillietudlem district burghs; and I also feel myself bound\nto dispose of him, though of him I regret I cannot make so decent an end\nas was done with Sir Richard Varney and Bill Sykes.\n\nHe deserves, however, as severe a fate as either of those heroes. With\nthe former we will not attempt to compare him, as the vices and devilry\nof the days of Queen Elizabeth are in no way similar to those in which\nwe indulge; but with Bill Sykes we may contrast him, as they flourished\nin the same era, and had their points of similitude, as well as their\npoints of difference.\n\nThey were both apparently born to prey on their own species; they both\nresolutely adhered to a fixed rule that they would in nowise earn their\nbread, and to a rule equally fixed that, though they would earn no\nbread, they would consume much. They were both of them blessed with\na total absence of sensibility and an utter disregard to the pain of\nothers, and had no other use for a heart than that of a machine for\nmaintaining the circulation of the blood. It is but little to say that\nneither of them ever acted on principle, on a knowledge, that is, of\nright and wrong, and a selection of the right; in their studies of the\nscience of evil they had progressed much further than this, and had\ntaught themselves to believe that that which other men called virtue\nwas, on its own account, to be regarded as mawkish, insipid, and useless\nfor such purposes as the acquisition of money or pleasure; whereas vice\nwas, on its own account, to be preferred, as offering the only road to\nthose things which they were desirous of possessing.\n\nSo far there was a great resemblance between Bill Sykes and Mr. Scott;\nbut then came the points of difference, which must give to the latter\na great pre-eminence in the eyes of that master whom they had both so\nworthily served. Bill could not boast the merit of selecting the course\nwhich he had run; he had served the Devil, having had, as it were, no\nchoice in the matter; he was born and bred and educated an evil-doer,\nand could hardly have deserted from the colours of his great Captain,\nwithout some spiritual interposition to enable him to do so. To Undy\na warmer reward must surely be due: he had been placed fairly on the\nworld's surface, with power to choose between good and bad, and had\ndeliberately taken the latter; to him had, at any rate, been explained\nthe theory of _meum_ and _tuum_, and he had resolved that he liked\n_tuum_ better than _meum_; he had learnt that there is a God ruling over\nus, and a Devil hankering after us, and had made up his mind that he\nwould belong to the latter. Bread and water would have come to him\nnaturally without any villany on his part, aye, and meat and milk,\nand wine and oil, the fat things of the world; but he elected to be a\nvillain; he liked to do the Devil's bidding.--Surely he was the better\nservant; surely he shall have the richer reward.\n\nAnd yet poor Bill Sykes, for whom here I would willingly say a word or\ntwo, could I, by so saying, mitigate the wrath against him, is always\nheld as the more detestable scoundrel. Lady, you now know them both. Is\nit not the fact, that, knowing him as you do, you could spend a pleasant\nhour enough with Mr. Scott, sitting next to him at dinner; whereas your\nblood would creep within you, your hair would stand on end, your voice\nwould stick in your throat, if you were suddenly told that Bill Sykes\nwas in your presence?\n\nPoor Bill! I have a sort of love for him, as he walks about wretched\nwith that dog of his, though I know that it is necessary to hang him.\nYes, Bill; I, your friend, cannot gainsay that, must acknowledge that.\nHard as the case may be, you must be hung; hung out of the way of\nfurther mischief; my spoons, my wife's throat, my children's brains,\ndemand that. You, Bill, and polecats, and such-like, must be squelched\nwhen we can come across you, seeing that you make yourself so\nuniversally disagreeable. It is your ordained nature to be disagreeable;\nyou plead silently. I know it; I admit the hardship of your case; but\nstill, my Bill, self-preservation is the first law of nature. You\nmust be hung. But, while hanging you, I admit that you are more sinned\nagainst than sinning. There is another, Bill, another, who will surely\ntake account of this in some way, though it is not for me to tell you\nhow.\n\nYes, I hang Bill Sykes with soft regret; but with what a savage joy,\nwith what exultation of heart, with what alacrity of eager soul, with\nwhat aptitude of mind to the deed, would I hang my friend, Undy Scott,\nthe member of Parliament for the Tillietudlem burghs, if I could but get\nat his throat for such a purpose! Hang him! aye, as high as Haman! In\nthis there would be no regret, no vacillation of purpose, no doubt as to\nthe propriety of the sacrifice, no feeling that I was so treating him,\nnot for his own desert, but for my advantage.\n\nWe hang men, I believe, with this object only, that we should deter\nothers from crime; but in hanging Bill we shall hardly deter his\nbrother. Bill Sykes must look to crime for his bread, seeing that he has\nbeen so educated, seeing that we have not yet taught him another trade.\n\nBut if I could hang Undy Scott, I think I should deter some others. The\nfigure of Undy swinging from a gibbet at the broad end of Lombard Street\nwould have an effect. Ah! my fingers itch to be at the rope.\n\nFate, however, and the laws are averse. To gibbet him, in one sense,\nwould have been my privilege, had I drunk deeper from that Castalian\nrill whose dark waters are tinged with the gall of poetic indignation;\nbut as in other sense I may not hang him, I will tell how he was driven\nfrom his club, and how he ceased to number himself among the legislators\nof his country.\n\nUndy Scott, among his other good qualities, possessed an enormous\nquantity of that which schoolboys in these days call 'cheek.' He was not\neasily browbeaten, and was generally prepared to browbeat others.\nMr. Chaffanbrass certainly did get the better of him; but then Mr.\nChaffanbrass was on his own dunghill. Could Undy Scott have had Mr.\nChaffanbrass down at the clubs, there would have been, perhaps, another\ntale to tell.\n\nGive me the cock that can crow in any yard; such cocks, however, we know\nare scarce. Undy Scott, as he left the Old Bailey, was aware that he had\ncut a sorry figure, and felt that he must immediately do something to\nput himself right again, at any rate before his portion of the world. He\nmust perform some exploit uncommonly cheeky in order to cover his late\ndiscomfiture. To get the better of Mr. Chaffanbrass at the Old Bailey\nhad been beyond him; but he might yet do something at the clubs to set\naside the unanimous verdict which had been given against him in the\ncity. Nay, he must do something, unless he was prepared to go to the\nwall utterly, and at once.\n\nGoing to the wall with Undy would mean absolute ruin; he lived but\non the cheekiness of his gait and habits; he had become member of\nParliament, Government official, railway director, and club aristocrat,\nmerely by dint of cheek. He had now received a great blow; he had\nstood before a crowd, and been annihilated by the better cheek of Mr.\nChaffanbrass, and, therefore, it behoved him at once to do something.\nWhen the perfume of the rose grows stale, the flower is at once thrown\naside, and carried off as foul refuse. It behoved Undy to see that his\nperfume was maintained in its purity, or he, too, would be carried off.\n\nThe club to which Undy more especially belonged was called the Downing;\nand of this Alaric was also a member, having been introduced into it by\nhis friend. Here had Alaric spent by far too many of the hours of his\nmarried life, and had become well known and popular. At the time of\nhis conviction, the summer was far advanced; it was then August;\nbut Parliament was still sitting, and there were sufficient club men\nremaining in London to create a daily gathering at the Downing.\n\nOn the day following that on which the verdict was found, Undy convened\na special committee of the club, in order that he might submit to it a\nproposition which he thought it indispensable should come from him; so,\nat least, he declared. The committee did assemble, and when Undy met it,\nhe saw among the faces before him not a few with whom he would willingly\nhave dispensed. However, he had come there to exercise his cheek; no\none there should cow him; the wig of Mr. Chaffanbrass was, at any rate,\nabsent.\n\nAnd so he submitted his proposition. I need not trouble my readers with\nthe neat little speech in which it was made. Undy was true to himself,\nand the speech was neat. The proposition was this: that as he had\nunfortunately been the means of introducing Mr. Alaric Tudor to the\nclub, he considered it to be his duty to suggest that the name of\nthat gentleman should be struck off the books. He then expressed his\nunmitigated disgust at the crime of which Tudor had been found guilty,\nuttered some nice little platitudes in the cause of virtue, and\nexpressed a hope 'that he might so far refer to a personal matter as\nto say that his father's family would take care that the lady, whose\nfortune had been the subject of the trial, should not lose one penny\nthrough the dishonesty of her trustee.'\n\nOh, Undy, as high as Haman, if I could! as high as Haman! and if not in\nLombard Street, then on that open ground where Waterloo Place bisects\nPall Mall, so that all the clubs might see thee!\n\n'He would advert,' he said, 'to one other matter, though, perhaps, his\ndoing so was unnecessary. It was probably known to them all that he had\nbeen a witness at the late trial; an iniquitous attempt had been made\nby the prisoner's counsel to connect his name with the prisoner's guilt.\nThey all too well knew the latitude allowed to lawyers in the criminal\ncourts, to pay much attention to this. Had he' (Undy Scott) 'in any way\ninfringed the laws of his country, he was there to answer for it. But he\nwould go further than this, and declare that if any member of that club\ndoubted his probity in the matter, he was perfectly willing to submit to\nsuch member documents which would,' &c., &c.\n\nHe finished his speech, and an awful silence reigned around him. No\nenthusiastic ardour welcomed the well-loved Undy back to his club, and\ncomforted him after the rough usage of the unpolished Chaffanbrass. No\nten or twenty combined voices expressed, by their clamorous negation of\nthe last-proposed process, that their Undy was above reproach. The eyes\naround looked into him with no friendly alacrity. Undy, Undy, more cheek\nstill, still more cheek, or you are surely lost.\n\n'If,' said he, in a well-assumed indignant tone of injured innocence,\n'there be any in the club who do suspect me of anything unbecoming a\ngentleman in this affair, I am willing to retire from it till the\nmatter shall have been investigated; but in such case I demand that the\ninvestigation be immediate.'\n\nOh, Undy, Undy, the supply of cheek is not bad; it is all but unlimited;\nbut yet it suffices thee not. 'Can there be positions in this modern\nWest End world of mine,' thought Undy to himself, 'in which cheek,\nunbounded cheek, will not suffice?' Oh, Undy, they are rare; but still\nthere are such, and this, unfortunately for thee, seemeth to be one of\nthem.\n\nAnd then got up a discreet old baronet, one who moveth not often in the\naffairs around him, but who, when he moveth, stirreth many waters; a man\nof broad acres, and a quiet, well-assured fame which has grown to him\nwithout his seeking it, as barnacles grow to the stout keel when it has\nbeen long a-swimming; him, of all men, would Undy have wished to see\nunconcerned with these matters.\n\nNot in many words, nor eloquent did Sir Thomas speak. 'He felt it his\nduty,' he said, 'to second the proposal made by Mr. Scott for removing\nMr. Tudor from amongst them. He had watched this trial with some care,\nand he pitied Mr. Tudor from the bottom of his heart. He would not have\nthought that he could have felt so strong a sympathy for a man convicted\nof dishonesty. But, Mr. Tudor had been convicted, and he must incur the\npenalties of his fault. One of these penalties must, undoubtedly, be his\nbanishment from this club. He therefore seconded Mr. Scott's proposal.'\n\nHe then stood silent for a moment, having finished that task; but yet he\ndid not sit down. Why, oh, why does he not sit down? why, O Undy,\ndoes he thus stand, looking at the surface of the table on which he is\nleaning?\n\n'And now,' he said, 'he had another proposition to make; and that was\nthat Mr. Undecimus Scott should also be expelled from the club,' and\nhaving so spoken, in a voice of unusual energy, he then sat down.\n\nAnd now, Undy, you may as well pack up, and be off, without further\nfuss, to Boulogne, Ostend, or some such idle Elysium, with such\nmoney-scrapings as you may be able to collect together. No importunity\nwill avail thee anything against the judges and jurymen who are now\ntrying thee. One word from that silent old baronet was worse to thee\nthan all that Mr. Chaffanbrass could say. Come! pack up; and begone.\n\nBut he was still a Member of Parliament. The Parliament, however, was\nabout to be dissolved, and, of course, it would be useless for him\nto stand again; he, like Mr. M'Buffer had had his spell of it, and he\nrecognized the necessity of vanishing. He at first thought that his life\nas a legislator might be allowed to come to a natural end, that he might\ndie as it were in his bed, without suffering the acute pain of applying\nfor the Chiltern Hundreds. In this, however, he found himself wrong.\nThe injured honour of all the Tillietudlemites rose against him with one\nindignant shout; and a rumour, a horrid rumour, of a severer fate met\nhis ears. He applied at once for the now coveted sinecure,--and was\nrefused. Her Majesty could not consent to entrust to him the duties of\nthe situation in question--; and in lieu thereof the House expelled him\nby its unanimous voice.\n\nAnd now, indeed, it was time for him to pack and begone. He was now\nliable to the vulgarest persecution from the vulgar herd; his very\ntailor and bootmaker would beleaguer him, and coarse unwashed bailiffs\ntake him by the collar. Yes, now indeed, it was time to be off.\n\nAnd off he was. He paid one fleeting visit to my Lord at Cauldkail\nCastle, collecting what little he might; another to his honourable wife,\nadding some slender increase to his little budget, and then he was off.\nWhither, it is needless to say--to Hamburg perhaps, or to Ems, or the\nricher tables of Homburg. How he flourished for a while with ambiguous\nsuccess; how he talked to the young English tourists of what he had done\nwhen in Parliament, especially for the rights of married women; how\nhe poked his 'Honourable' card in every one's way, and lugged Lord\nGaberlunzie into all conversations; how his face became pimply and his\nwardrobe seedy; and how at last his wretched life will ooze out from\nhim in some dark corner, like the filthy juice of a decayed fungus\nwhich makes hideous the hidden wall on which it bursts, all this is\nunnecessary more particularly to describe. He is probably still living,\nand those who desire his acquaintance will find him creeping round some\ngambling table, and trying to look as though he had in his pocket ample\nmeans to secure those hoards of money which men are so listlessly raking\nabout. From our view he has now vanished.\n\nIt was a bitter February morning, when two cabs stood packing themselves\nat No. 5, Paradise Row, Millbank. It was hardly yet six o'clock, and\nParadise Row was dark as Erebus; that solitary gas-light sticking out\nfrom the wall of the prison only made darkness visible; the tallow\ncandles which were brought in and out with every article that was\nstuffed under a seat, or into a corner, would get themselves blown out;\nand the sleet which was falling fast made the wicks wet, so that they\ncould with difficulty be relighted.\n\nBut at last the cabs were packed with luggage, and into one got Gertrude\nwith her husband, her baby, and her mother; and into the other Charley\nhanded Linda, then Alley, and lastly, the youthful maiden, who humbly\nbegged his pardon as she stepped up to the vehicle; and then, having\ngiven due directions to the driver, he not without difficulty squeezed\nhimself into the remaining space.\n\nSuch journeys as these are always made at a slow pace. Cabmen know very\nwell who must go fast, and who may go slow. Women with children going\non board an emigrant vessel at six o'clock on a February morning may be\ntaken very slowly. And very slowly Gertrude and her party were taken.\nTime had been--nay, it was but the other day--when Alaric's impatient\nsoul would have spurned at such a pace as this. But now he sat tranquil\nenough. His wife held one of his hands, and the other he pressed against\nhis eyes, as though shading them from the light. Light there was none,\nbut he had not yet learnt to face Mrs. Woodward even in the darkness.\n\nHe had come out of the prison on the day before, and had spent an\nevening with her. It is needless to say that no one had upbraided him,\nthat no one had hinted that his backslidings had caused all this present\nmisery, had brought them all to that wretched cabin, and would on the\nmorrow separate, perhaps for ever, a mother and a child who loved each\nother so dearly. No one spoke to him of this; perhaps no one thought of\nit; he, however, did so think of it that he could not hold his head up\nbefore them.\n\n'He was ill,' Gertrude said; 'his long confinement had prostrated him;\nbut the sea air would revive him in a day or two.' And then she made\nherself busy, and got the tea for them, and strove, not wholly in vain,'\nto drive dull care away!'\n\nBut slowly as the cabs went in spite of Charley's vocal execrations,\nthey did get to the docks in time. Who, indeed, was ever too late at\nthe docks? Who, that ever went there, had not to linger, linger, linger,\ntill every shred of patience was clean worn out? They got to the\ndocks in time, and got on board that fast-sailing, clipper-built,\nnever-beaten, always-healthy ship, the _Flash of Lightning_, 5,600 tons,\nA 1. Why, we have often wondered, are ships designated as A 1, seeing\nthat all ships are of that class? Where is the excellence, seeing that\nall share it? Of course the _Flash of Lightning_ was A 1. The author has\nfor years been looking out, and has not yet found a ship advertised as A\n2, or even as B 1. What is this catalogue of comparative excellence, of\nwhich there is but one visible number?\n\nThe world, we think, makes a great mistake on the subject of saying, or\nacting, farewell. The word or deed should partake of the suddenness\nof electricity; but we all drawl through it at a snail's pace. We are\nsupposed to tear ourselves from our friends; but tearing is a process\nwhich should be done quickly. What is so wretched as lingering over\na last kiss, giving the hand for the third time, saying over and over\nagain, 'Good-bye, John, God bless you; and mind you write!' Who has\nnot seen his dearest friends standing round the window of a railway\ncarriage, while the train would not start, and has not longed to say to\nthem, 'Stand not upon the order of your going, but go at once!' And\nof all such farewells, the ship's farewell is the longest and the most\ndreary. One sits on a damp bench, snuffing up the odour of oil and\nropes, cudgelling one's brains to think what further word of increased\ntenderness can be spoken. No tenderer word can be spoken. One returns\nagain and again to the weather, to coats and cloaks, perhaps even to\nsandwiches and the sherry flask. All effect is thus destroyed, and a\ntrespass is made even on the domain of feeling.\n\nI remember a line of poetry, learnt in my earliest youth, and which I\nbelieve to have emanated from a sentimental Frenchman, a man of genius,\nwith whom my parents were acquainted. It is as follows:--\n\n  Are you go?--Is you gone?--And I left?--Vera vell!\n\nNow the whole business of a farewell is contained in that line. When the\nmoment comes, let that be said; let that be said and felt, and then let\nthe dear ones depart.\n\nMrs. Woodward and Gertrude--God bless them!--had never studied the\nsubject. They knew no better than to sit in the nasty cabin, surrounded\nby boxes, stewards, porters, children, and abominations of every kind,\nholding each other's hands, and pressing damp handkerchiefs to their\neyes. The delay, the lingering, upset even Gertrude, and brought her for\na moment down to the usual level of leave-taking womanhood. Alaric, the\nmeanwhile, stood leaning over the taffrail with Charley, as mute as the\nfishes beneath him.\n\n'Write to us the moment you get there,' said Charley. How often had the\ninjunction been given! 'And now we had better get off--you'll be better\nwhen we are gone, Alaric,'--Charley had some sense of the truth about\nhim--'and, Alaric, take my word for it, I'll come and set the Melbourne\nWeights and Measures to rights before long--I'll come and weigh your\ngold for you.'\n\n'We had better be going now,' said Charley, looking down into the cabin;\n'they may let loose and be off any moment now.'\n\n'Oh, Charley, not yet, not yet,' said Linda, clinging to her sister.\n\n'You'll have to go down to the Nore, if you stay; that's all,' said\nCharley.\n\nAnd then again began the kissing and the crying. Yes, ye dear ones--it\nis hard to part--it is hard for the mother to see the child of her bosom\ntorn from her for ever; it is cruel that sisters should be severed: it\nis a harsh sentence for the world to give, that of such a separation as\nthis. These, O ye loving hearts, are the penalties of love! Those that\nare content to love must always be content to pay them.\n\n'Go, mamma, go,' said Gertrude; 'dearest, best, sweetest mother--my\nown, own mother; go, Linda, darling Linda. Give my kindest love to\nHarry--Charley, you and Harry will be good to mamma, I know you will.\nAnd mamma'--and then she whispered to her mother one last prayer in\nCharley's favour--'she may love him now, indeed she may.'\n\nAlaric came to them at the last moment--'Mrs. Woodward,' said he, 'say\nthat you forgive me.'\n\n'I do,' said she, embracing him--'God knows that I do;--but, Alaric,\nremember what a treasure you possess.'\n\nAnd so they parted. May God speed the wanderers!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nTHE FATE OF THE NAVVIES\n\n\nAnd now, having dispatched Alaric and his wife and bairns on their\nlong journey, we must go back for a while and tell how Charley had been\ntransformed from an impudent, idle young Navvy into a well-conducted,\nzealous young Weights.\n\nWhen Alaric was convicted, Charley had, as we all know, belonged to the\nInternal Navigation; when the six months' sentence had expired, Charley\nwas in full blow at the decorous office in Whitehall; and during the\nsame period Norman had resigned and taken on himself the new duties of a\ncountry squire. The change which had been made had affected others\nthan Charley. It had been produced by one of those far-stretching,\nworld-moving commotions which now and then occur, sometimes twice or\nthrice in a generation, and, perhaps, not again for half a century,\ncausing timid men to whisper in corners, and the brave and high-spirited\nto struggle with the struggling waves, so that when the storm subsides\nthey may be found floating on the surface. A moral earthquake had been\nendured by a portion of the Civil Service of the country.\n\nThe Internal Navigation had--No, my prognostic reader, it had not been\nreformed; no new blood had been infused into it; no attempt had been\nmade to produce a better discipline by the appointment of a younger\nsecretary; there had been no carting away of decayed wood in the shape\nof Mr. Snape, or gathering of rank weeds in the form of Mr. Corkscrew;\nnothing of the kind had been attempted. No--the disease had gone too far\neither for phlebotomy, purging, or cautery. The Internal Navigation had\nceased to exist! Its demise had been in this wise.--It may be remembered\nthat some time since Mr. Oldeschole had mentioned in the hearing of Mr.\nSnape that things were going wrong. Sir Gregory Hardlines had expressed\nan adverse opinion as to the Internal Navigation, and worse, ten times\nworse than that, there had been an article in the _Times_. Now, we all\nknow that if anything is ever done in any way towards improvement in\nthese days, the public press does it. And we all know, also, of what the\npublic press consists. Mr. Oldeschole knew this well, and even Mr.\nSnape had a glimmering idea of the truth. When he read that article,\nMr. Oldeschole felt that his days were numbered, and Mr. Snape, when he\nheard of it, began to calculate for the hundredth time to what\nhighest amount of pension he might be adjudged to be entitled by a\nliberal-minded Treasury minute.\n\nMr. Oldeschole began to set his house in order, hopelessly; for any such\neffort the time was gone by. It was too late for the office to be so\ndone by, and too late for Mr. Oldeschole to do it. He had no aptitude\nfor new styles and modern improvements; he could not understand Sir\nGregory's code of rules, and was dumbfounded by the Civil Service\nrequisitions that were made upon him from time to time. Then came\nfrequent calls for him to attend at Sir Gregory's office. There a new\nbroom had been brought in, in the place of our poor friend Alaric, a\nbroom which seemed determined to sweep all before it with an unmitigable\nenergy. Mr. Oldeschole found that he could not stand at all before this\nyoung Hercules, seeing that his special stall was considered to be the\nfoulest in the whole range of the Augean stables. He soon saw that\nthe river was to be turned in on him, and that he was to be officially\nobliterated in the flood.\n\nThe civility of those wonder-doing demigods--those Magi of the Civil\nService office--was most oppressive to him. When he got to the board, he\nwas always treated with a deference which he knew was but a prelude to\nbarbaric tortures. They would ask him to sit down in a beautiful new\nleathern arm-chair, as though he were really some great man, and then\nexamine him as they would a candidate for the Custom House, smiling\nalways, but looking at him as though they were determined to see through\nhim.\n\nThey asked him all manner of questions; but there was one question which\nthey put to him, day after day, for four days, that nearly drove him\nmad. It was always put by that horrid young lynx-eyed new commissioner,\nwho sat there with his hair brushed high from off his forehead,\npeering out of his capacious, excellently-washed shirt-collars, a\npersonification of conscious official zeal.\n\n'And now, Mr. Oldeschole, if you have had leisure to consider\nthe question more fully, perhaps you can define to us what is\nthe--hum--hm--the use--hm--hm--the exact use of the Internal Navigation\nOffice?'\n\nAnd then Sir Warwick would go on looking through his millstone as though\nnow he really had a hope of seeing something, and Sir Gregory would lean\nback in his chair, and rubbing his hands slowly over each other, like a\ngreat Akinetos as he was, wait leisurely for Mr. Oldeschole's answer, or\nrather for his no answer.\n\nWhat a question was this to ask of a man who had spent all his life in\nthe Internal Navigation Office! O reader! should it chance that thou art\na clergyman, imagine what it would be to thee, wert thou asked what is\nthe exact use of the Church of England; and that, too, by some stubborn\ncatechist whom thou wert bound to answer; or, if a lady, happy in a\nhusband and family, say, what would be thy feelings if demanded to\ndefine the exact use of matrimony? Use! Is it not all in all to thee?\n\nMr. Oldeschole felt a hearty inward conviction that his office had\nbeen of very great use. In the first place, had he not drawn from it\na thousand a year for the last five-and-twenty years? had it not given\nmaintenance and employment to many worthy men who might perhaps have\nfound it difficult to obtain maintenance elsewhere? had it not always\nbeen an office, a public office of note and reputation, with proper work\nassigned to it? The use of it--the exact use of it? Mr. Oldeschole at\nlast declared, with some indignation in his tone, that he had been there\nfor forty years and knew well that the office was very useful; but that\nhe would not undertake to define its exact use. 'Thank you, thank you,\nMr. Oldeschole--that will do, I think,' said the very spruce-looking new\ngentleman out of his shirt-collars.\n\nIn these days there was a kind of prescience at the Internal Navigation\nthat something special was going to be done with them. Mr. Oldeschole\nsaid nothing openly; but it may be presumed that he did whisper somewhat\nto those of the seniors around him in whom he most confided. And\nthen, his frequent visits to Whitehall were spoken of even by the most\nthoughtless of the navvies, and the threatenings of the coming storm\nrevealed themselves with more or less distinctness to every mind.\n\nAt last the thunder-cloud broke and the bolt fell. Mr. Oldeschole was\ninformed that the Lords of the Treasury had resolved on breaking up the\nestablishment and providing for the duties in another way. As the word\nduties passed Sir Gregory's lips a slight smile was seen to hover\nround the mouth of the new commissioner. Mr. Oldeschole would, he\nwas informed, receive an official notification to this effect on the\nfollowing morning; and on the following morning accordingly a dispatch\narrived, of great length, containing the resolution of my Lords, and\nputting an absolute extinguisher on the life of every navvy.\n\nHow Mr. Oldeschole, with tears streaming down his cheeks, communicated\nthe tidings to the elder brethren; and how the elder brethren, with\npalpitating hearts and quivering voices, repeated the tale to the\nlistening juniors, I cannot now describe. The boldest spirits were then\ncowed, the loudest miscreants were then silenced, there were but few\ngibes, but little jeering at the Internal Navigation on that day; though\nCharley, who had already other hopes, contrived to keep up his spirits.\nThe men stood about talking in clusters, and old animosities were at an\nend. The lamb sat down with the wolf, and Mr. Snape and Dick Scatterall\nbecame quite confidential.\n\n'I knew it was going to happen,' said Mr. Snape to him. 'Indeed, Mr.\nOldeschole has been consulting us about it for some time; but I must own\nI did not think it would be so sudden; I must own that.'\n\n'If you knew it was coming,' said Corkscrew, 'why didn't you tell a\nchap?'\n\n'I was not at liberty,' said Mr. Snape, looking very wise.\n\n'We shall all have liberty enough now,' said Scatterall; 'I wonder what\nthey'll do with us; eh, Charley?'\n\n'I believe they will send the worst of us to Spike Island or Dartmoor\nprison,' said Charley; 'but Mr. Snape, no doubt, has heard and can tell\nus.'\n\n'Oh, come, Charley! It don't do to chaff now,' said a young navvy, who\nwas especially down in the mouth. 'I wonder will they do anything for a\nfellow?'\n\n'I heard my uncle, in Parliament Street, say, that when a chap has\ngot any _infested_ interest in a thing, they can't turn him out,' said\nCorkscrew; 'and my uncle is a parliamentary agent.'\n\n'Can't they though!' said Scatterall. 'It seems to me that they mean\nto, at any rate; there wasn't a word about pensions or anything of that\nsort, was there, Mr. Snape?'\n\n'Not a word,' said Snape. 'But those who are entitled to pensions can't\nbe affected injuriously. As far as I can see they must give me my whole\nsalary. I don't think they can do less.'\n\n'You're all serene then, Mr. Snape,' said Charley; 'you're in the right\nbox. Looking at matters in that light, Mr. Snape, I think you ought to\nstand something handsome in the shape of lunch. Come, what do you say to\nchops and stout all round? Dick will go over and order it in a minute.'\n\n'I wish you wouldn't, Charley,' said the navvy who seemed to be most\naffected, and who, in his present humour, could not endure a joke,\nAs Mr. Snape did not seem to accede to Charley's views, the liberal\nproposition fell to the ground.\n\n'Care killed a cat,' said Scatterall. 'I shan't break my heart about it.\nI never liked the shop--did you, Charley?'\n\n'Well, I must say I think we have been very comfortable here, under\nMr. Snape,' said Charley. But if Mr. Snape is to go, why the office\ncertainly would be deuced dull without him.'\n\n'Charley!' said the broken-hearted young navvy, in a tone of reproach.\n\nSorrow, however, did not take away their appetite, and as Mr. Snape did\nnot see fitting occasion for providing a banquet, they clubbed together,\nand among them managed to get a spread of beefsteaks and porter.\nScatterall, as requested, went across the Strand to order it at the\ncookshop, while Corkscrew and Charley prepared the tables. 'And now\nmind it's the thing,' said Dick, who, with intimate familiarity, had\npenetrated into the eating-house kitchen; 'not dry, you know, or too\nmuch done; and lots of fat.'\n\nAnd then, as the generous viands renewed their strength, and as the\npotent stout warmed their blood, happier ideas came to them, and they\nbegan to hope that the world was not all over. 'Well, I shall try for\nthe Customs,' said the unhappy one, after a deep pull at the pewter. 'I\nshall try for the Customs; one does get such stunning feeds for tenpence\nat that place in Thames Street.' Poor youth! his ideas of earning his\nbread did not in their wildest flight spread beyond the public offices\nof the Civil Service.\n\nFor a few days longer they hung about the old office, doing nothing--how\ncould men so circumstanced do anything?--and waiting for their fate.\nAt last their fate was announced. Mr. Oldeschole retired with his full\nsalary. Secretaries and such-like always retire with full pay, as it\nis necessary that dignity should be supported. Mr. Snape and the\nother seniors were pensioned, with a careful respect to their years of\nservice; with which arrangement they all of them expressed themselves\nhighly indignant, and loudly threatened to bring the cruelty of their\ntreatment before Parliament, by the aid of sundry members, who were\nsupposed to be on the look out for such work; but as nothing further was\never heard of them, it may be presumed that the members in question\ndid not regard the case as one on which the Government of the day\nwas sufficiently vulnerable to make it worth their while to trouble\nthemselves. Of the younger clerks, two or three, including the unhappy\none, were drafted into other offices; some others received one or more\nyears' pay, and then tore themselves away from the fascinations of\nLondon life; among those was Mr. R. Scatterall, who, in after years,\nwill doubtless become a lawgiver in Hong-Kong; for to that colony has he\nbetaken himself. Some few others, more unfortunate than the rest, among\nwhom poor Screwy was the most conspicuous, were treated with a more\nabsolute rigour, and were sent upon the world portionless. Screwy\nhad been constant in his devotion to pork chops, and had persisted in\nspelling blue without the final 'e.' He was therefore, declared unworthy\nof any further public confidence whatever. He is now in his uncle's\noffice in Parliament Street; and it is to be hoped that his peculiar\ntalents may there be found useful.\n\nAnd so the Internal Navigation Office came to an end, and the dull,\ndingy rooms were vacant. Ruthless men shovelled off as waste paper\nall the lock entries of which Charley had once been so proud; and the\nponderous ledgers, which Mr. Snape had delighted to haul about, were\nsent away into Cimmerian darkness, and probably to utter destruction.\nAnd then the Internal Navigation was no more.\n\nAmong those who were drafted into other offices was Charley, whom\npropitious fate took to the Weights and Measures. But it must not be\nimagined that chance took him there. The Weights and Measures was an\nElysium, the door of which was never casually open.\n\nCharley at this time was a much-altered man; not that he had become a\ngood clerk at his old office--such a change one may say was impossible;\nthere were no good clerks at the Internal Navigation, and Charley had\nso long been among navvies the most knavish or navviest, that any such\ntransformation would have met with no credence--but out of his office he\nhad become a much-altered man. As Katie had said, it was as though\nsome one had come to him from the dead. He could not go back to his old\nhaunts, he could not return like a dog to his vomit, as long as he had\nthat purse so near his heart, as long as that voice sounded in his ear,\nwhile the memory of that kiss lingered in his heart.\n\nHe now told everything to Gertrude, all his debts, all his love, and\nall his despair. There is no relief for sorrow like the sympathy of a\nfriend, if one can only find it. But then the sympathy must be real;\nmock sympathy always tells the truth against itself, always fails to\ndeceive. He told everything to Gertrude, and by her counsel he told much\nto Norman. He could not speak to him, true friend as he was, of Katie\nand her love. There was that about the subject which made it too sacred\nfor man's ears, too full of tenderness to be spoken of without feminine\ntears. It was only in the little parlour at Paradise Row, when the\nevening had grown dark, and Gertrude was sitting with her baby in her\narms, that the boisterous young navvy could bring himself to speak of\nhis love.\n\nDuring these months Katie's health had greatly improved, and as she\nherself had gained in strength, she had gradually begun to think that\nit was yet possible for her to live. Little was now said by her about\nCharley, and not much was said of him in her hearing; but still she did\nlearn how he had changed his office, and with his office his mode of\nlife; she did hear of his literary efforts, and of his kindness to\nGertrude, and it would seem as though it were ordained that his moral\nlife and her physical life were to gain strength together.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nMR. NOGO'S LAST QUESTION\n\n\nBut at this time Charley was not idle. The fate of 'Crinoline and\nMacassar' has not yet been told; nor has that of the two rival\nchieftains, the 'Baron of Ballyporeen and Sir Anthony Allan-a-dale.'\nThese heart-rending tales appeared in due course, bit by bit, in the\npages of the _Daily Delight_. On every morning of the week, Sundays\nexcepted, a page and a half of Charley's narrative was given to the\nexpectant public; and though I am not prepared to say that the public\nreceived the offering with any violent acclamations of applause, that\nhis name became suddenly that of a great unknown, that literary cliques\ntalked about him to the exclusion of other topics, or that he rose\nfamous one morning as Byron did after the publication of the 'Corsair,'\nnevertheless something was said in his praise. The _Daily Delight_, on\nthe whole, was rather belittled by its grander brethren of the press;\nbut a word or two was said here and there to exempt Charley's\nfictions from the general pooh-poohing with which the remainder of the\npublication was treated.\n\nSuccess, such as this even, is dear to the mind of a young author,\nand Charley began to feel that he had done something. The editor was\nproportionably civil to him, and he was encouraged to commence a third\nhistoriette.\n\n'We have polished off poison and petticoats pretty well,' said the\neditor; 'what do you say to something political?'\n\nCharley had no objection in life.\n\n'This Divorce Bill, now--we could have half a dozen married couples\nall separating, getting rid of their ribs and buckling again,\nhelter-skelter, every man to somebody else's wife; and the parish parson\nrefusing to do the work; just to show the immorality of the thing.'\n\nCharley said he'd think about it.\n\n'Or the Danubian Principalities and the French Alliance--could you\nmanage now to lay your scene in Constantinople?'\n\nCharley doubted whether he could.\n\n'Or perhaps India is the thing? The Cawnpore massacre would work up into\nany lengths you pleased. You could get a file of the _Times_, you know,\nfor your facts.'\n\nBut while the editor was giving these various valuable hints as to\nthe author's future subjects, the author himself, with base mind, was\nthinking how much he should be paid for his past labours. At last he\nventured, in the mildest manner, to allude to the subject.\n\n'Payment!' said the editor.\n\nCharley said that he had understood that there was to be some fixed\nscale of pay; so much per sheet, or something of that sort.\n\n'Undoubtedly there will,' said the editor; 'and those who will have the\ncourage and perseverance to work through with us, till the publication\nhas obtained that wide popularity which it is sure to achieve, will\ndoubtless be paid,--be paid as no writers for any periodical in this\nmetropolis have ever yet been paid. But at present, Mr. Tudor, you\nreally must be aware that it is quite out of the question.'\n\nCharley had not the courage and perseverance to work through with\nthe _Daily Delight_ till it had achieved its promised popularity, and\nconsequently left its ranks like a dastard. He consulted both Gertrude\nand Norman on the subject, and on their advice set himself to work on\nhis own bottom. 'You may perhaps manage to fly alone,' said Gertrude;\n'but you will find it very difficult to fly if you tie the whole weight\nof the _Daily Delight_ under your wings.' So Charley prepared himself\nfor solitary soaring.\n\nWhile he was thus working, the time arrived at which Norman was to leave\nhis office, and it occurred to him that it might be possible that he\nshould bequeath his vacancy to Charley. He went himself to Sir Gregory,\nand explained, not only his own circumstances, and his former friendship\nwith Alaric Tudor, but also the relationship between Alaric and Charley.\nHe then learnt, in the strictest confidence of course, that the doom\nof the Internal Navigation had just been settled, and that it would be\nnecessary to place in other offices those young men who could in any way\nbe regarded as worth their salt, and, after considerable manoeuvring,\nhad it so arranged that the ne'er-do-well young navvy should recommence\nhis official life under better auspices.\n\nNor did Charley come in at the bottom of his office, but was allowed,\nby some inscrutable order of the great men who arranged those things,\nto take a position in the Weights and Measures equal in seniority and\nstanding to that which he had held at the Navigation, and much higher,\nof course, in pay. There is an old saying, which the unenlightened\ncredit, and which declares that that which is sauce for the goose is\nsauce also for the gander. Nothing put into a proverb since the days of\nSolomon was ever more untrue. That which is sauce for the goose is not\nsauce for the gander, and especially is not so in official life. Poor\nScrewy was the goose, and certainly got the sauce best suited to him\nwhen he was turned adrift out of the Civil Service. Charley was the\ngander, and fond as I am of him for his many excellent qualities, I am\nfain to own that justice might fairly have demanded that he should be\ncooked after the same receipt. But it suited certain potent personages\nto make a swan of him; and therefore, though it had long been an assured\nfact through the whole service that no man was ever known to enter\nthe Weights and Measures without the strictest examination, though the\ncharacter of aspirants for that high office was always subjected to a\nrigid scrutiny, though knowledge, accomplishments, industry, morality,\noutward decency, inward zeal, and all the cardinal virtues were\nabsolutely requisite, still Charley was admitted, without any\nexamination or scrutiny whatever, during the commotion consequent upon\nthe earthquake above described.\n\nCharley went to the Weights some time during the recess. In the process\nof the next session Mr. Nogo gave notice that he meant to ask the\nGovernment a question as to a gross act of injustice which had been\nperpetrated--so at least the matter had been represented to him--on the\nsuppression of the Internal Navigation Office.\n\nMr. Nogo did not at first find it very easy to get a fitting opportunity\nfor asking his question. He had to give notice, and inquiries had to\nbe made, and the responsible people were away, and various customary\naccidents happened, so that it was late in June before the question was\nput. Mr. Nogo, however, persevered ruthlessly, and after six months'\nlabour, did deliver himself of an indignant, and, as his friends\ndeclared to him, a very telling speech.\n\nIt was reported at the time by the opposition newspapers, and need not\ntherefore be given here. But the upshot was this: two men bearing\nequal character--Mr. Nogo would not say whether the characters of the\ngentlemen were good or bad; he would only say equal characters--sat in\nthe same room at this now defunct office; one was Mr. Corkscrew and the\nother Mr. Tudor. One had no friends in the Civil Service, but the other\nwas more fortunate. Mr. Corkscrew had been sent upon the world a ruined,\nblighted man, without any compensation, without any regard for his\ninterests, without any consideration for his past services or future\nprospects. They would be told that the Government had no further need of\nhis labours, and that they could not dare to saddle the country with a\npension for so young a man. But what had been done in the case of the\nother gentleman? Why, he had been put into a valuable situation, in the\nbest Government office in London, had been placed over the heads of a\ndozen others, who had been there before him, &c., &c., &c. And then Mr.\nNogo ended with so vehement an attack on Sir Gregory, and the Government\nas connected with him, that the dogs began to whet their teeth and\nprepare for a tug at the great badger.\n\nBut circumstances were mischancy with Mr. Nogo, and all he said\nredounded only to the credit of our friend Charley. His black\nundoubtedly was black; the merits of Charley and Mr. Corkscrew, as\npublic servants, had been about equal; but Mr. Whip Vigil turned the\nblack into white in three minutes.\n\nAs he got upon his legs, smiling after the manner of his great exemplar,\nhe held in his hand a small note and a newspaper. 'A comparison,' he\nsaid, 'had been instituted between the merits of two gentlemen formerly\nin the employment of the Crown, one of them had been selected for\nfurther employment, and the other rejected. The honourable member for\nMile End had, he regretted to say, instituted this comparison. They all\nknew what was the proverbial character of a comparison. It was, however,\nready made to his hands, and there was nothing left for him, Mr. Whip\nVigil, but to go on with it. This, however, he would do in as light a\nmanner as possible. It had been thought that the one gentleman would not\nsuit the public service, and that the other would do so. It was for him\nmerely to defend this opinion. He now held in his hand a letter written\nby the prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 of the honourable member for Limehouse; he would not\nread it--' (cries of 'Read, read!') 'no, he would not read it, but the\nhonourable member might if he would--and could. He himself was prepared\nto say that a gentleman who chose to express himself in such a style\nin his private notes--this note, however, was not private in the usual\nsense--could hardly be expected to command a proper supply of wholesome\nEnglish, such as the service of the Crown demanded!' Then Mr. Vigil\nhanded across to Mr. Nogo poor Screwy's unfortunate letter about the\npork chops. 'As to the other gentleman, whose name was now respectably\nknown in the lighter walks of literature, he would, if permitted,\nread the opinion expressed as to his style of language by a literary\npublication of the day; and then the House would see whether or no\nthe produce of the Civil Service field had not been properly winnowed;\nwhether the wheat had not been garnered, and the chaff neglected.' And\nthen the right honourable gentleman read some half-dozen lines, highly\neulogistic of Charley's first solitary flight.\n\nPoor Mr. Nogo remained in silence, feeling that his black had become\nwhite to all intents and purposes; and the big badger sat by and\ngrinned, not deigning to notice the dogs around him. Thus it may be seen\nthat that which is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander.\n\nEarly in the spring Norman was married; and then, as had been before\narranged, Charley once more went to Surbiton Cottage. The marriage was\na very quiet affair. The feeling of disgrace which had fallen upon them\nall since the days of Alaric's trial had by no means worn itself away.\nThere were none of them yet--no, not one of the Cottage circle, from\nUncle Bat down to the parlour-maid--who felt that they had a right to\nhold up their faces before the light of day as they had formerly done.\nThere was a cloud over their house, visible perhaps with more or less\ndistinctness to all eyes, but which to themselves appeared black as\nnight. That evil which Alaric had done to them was not to be undone in a\nfew moons. We are all of us responsible for our friends, fathers-in-law\nfor their sons-in-law, brothers for their sisters, husbands for their\nwives, parents for their children, and children even for their parents.\nWe cannot wipe off from us, as with a wet cloth, the stains left by the\nfault of those who are near to us. The ink-spot will cling. Oh! Alaric,\nAlaric, that thou, thou who knewest all this, that thou shouldest have\ndone this thing! They had forgiven his offence against them, but they\ncould not forget their own involuntary participation in his disgrace. It\nwas not for them now to shine forth to the world with fine gala doings,\nand gay gaudy colours, as they had done when Gertrude had been married.\n\nBut still there was happiness--quiet, staid happiness--at the Cottage.\nMrs. Woodward could not but be happy to see Linda married to Harry\nNorman, her own favourite, him whom she had selected in her heart\nfor her son-in-law from out of all the world. And now, too, she was\nbeginning to be conscious that Harry and Linda were better suited for\neach other than he and Gertrude would have been. What would have been\nLinda's fate, how unendurable, had she been Alaric's wife, when Alaric\nfell? How would she have borne such a fall? What could she have done,\npoor lamb, towards mending the broken thread or binding the bruised\nlimbs? What balm could she have poured into such wounds as those which\nfate had inflicted on Gertrude and her household? But at Normansgrove,\nwith a steady old housekeeper at her back, and her husband always by\nto give her courage, Linda would find the very place for which she was\nsuited.\n\nAnd then Mrs. Woodward had another source of joy, of liveliest joy, in\nKatie's mending looks. She was at the wedding, though hardly with her\nmother's approval.\n\nAs she got better her old spirit returned to her, and it became\ndifficult to refuse her anything. It was in vain that her mother talked\nof the cold church, and easterly winds, and the necessary lightness of\na bridesmaid's attire. Katie argued that the church was only two hundred\nyards off, that she never suffered from the cold, and that though\ndressed in light colours, as became a bridesmaid, she would, if allowed\nto go, wear over her white frock any amount of cloaks which her mother\nchose to impose on her. Of course she went, and we will not say how\nbeautiful she looked, when she clung to Linda in the vestry-room, and\nall her mother's wrappings fell in disorder from her shoulders.\n\nSo Linda was married and carried off to Normansgrove, and Katie remained\nwith her mother and Uncle Bat.\n\n'Mamma, we will never part--will we, mamma?' said she, as they comforted\neach other that evening after the Normans were gone, and when Charley\nalso had returned to London.\n\n'When you go, Katie, I think you must take me with you,' said her\nmother, smiling through her tears. 'But what will poor Uncle Bat do? I\nfear you can't take him also.'\n\n'I will never go from you, mamma.'\n\nHer mother knew what she meant. Charley had been there, Charley to whom\nshe had declared her love when lying, as she thought, on her bed of\ndeath--Charley had been there again, and had stood close to her, and\ntouched her hand, and looked--oh, how much handsomer he was than Harry,\nhow much brighter than Alaric!--he had touched her hand, and spoken\nto her one word of joy at her recovered health. But that had been all.\nThere was a sort of compact, Katie knew, that there should be no other\nTudor marriage. Charley was not now the scamp he had been, but still--it\nwas understood that her love was not to win its object.\n\n'I will never go from you, mamma.'\n\nBut Mrs. Woodward's heart was not hard as the nether millstone. She drew\nher daughter to her, and as she pressed her to her bosom, she whispered\ninto her ears that she now hoped they might all be happy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nCONCLUSION\n\n\nOur tale and toils have now drawn nigh to an end; our loves and our\nsorrows are over; and we are soon to part company with the three clerks\nand their three wives. Their three wives? Why, yes. It need hardly be\ntold in so many words to an habitual novel-reader that Charley did get\nhis bride at last.\n\nNevertheless, Katie kept her promise to Mrs. Woodward. What promise did\nshe ever make and not keep? She kept her promise, and did not go from\nher mother. She married Mr. Charles Tudor, of the Weights and Measures,\nthat distinguished master of modern fiction, as the _Literary Censor_\nvery civilly called him the other day; and Mr. Charles Tudor became\nmaster of Surbiton Cottage.\n\nReader! take one last leap with me, and presume that two years have\nflown from us since the end of the last chapter; or rather somewhat more\nthan two years, for we would have it high midsummer when we take our\nlast farewell of Surbiton Cottage.\n\nBut sundry changes had taken place at the Cottage, and of such a nature,\nthat were it not for the old name's sake, we should now find ourselves\nbound to call the place Surbiton Villa, or Surbiton Hall, or Surbiton\nHouse. It certainly had no longer any right to the title of a cottage;\nfor Charley, in anticipation of what Lucina might do for him, had added\non sundry rooms, a children's room on the ground floor, and a nursery\nabove, and a couple of additional bedrooms on the other side, so that\nthe house was now a comfortable abode for an increasing family.\n\nAt the time of which we are now speaking Lucina had not as yet done\nmuch; for, in truth, Charley had been married but little over twelve\nmonths; but there appeared every reason to believe that the goddess\nwould be propitious. There was already one little rocking shrine, up in\nthat cosy temple opening out of Katie's bedroom--we beg her pardon, we\nshould have said Mrs. Charles Tudor's bedroom--one precious tabernacle\nin which was laid a little man-deity, a young Charley, to whom was daily\npaid a multitude of very sincere devotions.\n\nHow precious are all the belongings of a first baby; how dear are the\ncradle, the lace-caps, the first coral, all the little duds which are\nmade with such punctilious care and anxious efforts of nicest needlework\nto encircle that small lump of pink humanity! What care is taken that\nall shall be in order! See that basket lined with crimson silk, prepared\nto hold his various garments, while the mother, jealous of her nurse,\ninsists on tying every string with her own fingers. And then how soon\nthe change comes; how different it is when there are ten of them, and\nthe tenth is allowed to inherit the well-worn wealth which the ninth, a\nyear ago, had received from the eighth. There is no crimson silk basket\nthen, I trow.\n\n'Jane, Jane, where are my boots?' 'Mary, I've lost my trousers!' Such\nsounds are heard, shouted through the house from powerful lungs.\n\n'Why, Charley,' says the mother, as her eldest hope rushes in to\nbreakfast with dishevelled hair and dirty hands, 'you've got no\nhandkerchief on your neck--what have you done with your handkerchief?'\n\n'No, mamma; it came off in the hay-loft, and I can't find it.'\n\n'Papa,' says the lady wife, turning to her lord, who is reading his\nnewspaper over his coffee--'papa, you really must speak to Charley; he\nwill not mind me. He was dressed quite nicely an hour ago, and do see\nwhat a figure he has made himself.'\n\n'Charley,' says papa, not quite relishing this disturbance in the midst\nof a very interesting badger-baiting--'Charley, my boy, if you don't\nmind your P's and Q's, you and I shall fall out; mind that;' and he\nagain goes on with his sport; and mamma goes on with her teapot, looking\nnot exactly like Patience on a monument.\n\nSuch are the joys which await you, Mr. Charles Tudor; but not to such\nhave you as yet arrived. As yet there is but the one little pink deity\nin the rocking shrine above; but one, at least, of your own. At the\nmoment of which we are now speaking there were visitors at Surbiton\nCottage, and the new nursery was brought into full use. Mr. and Mrs.\nNorman of Normansgrove were there with their two children and two maids,\nand grandmamma Woodward had her hands quite full in the family nursery\nline.\n\nIt was a beautiful summer evening, and the two young mothers were\nsitting with Mrs. Woodward and Uncle Bat in the drawing-room, waiting\nfor their lords' return from London. As usual, when they stayed late,\nthe two men were to dine at their club and come down to tea. The\nnursemaids were walking on the lawn before the window with their\ncharges, and the three ladies were busily employed with some\nfairly-written manuscript pages, which they were cutting carefully into\nshape, and arranging in particular form.\n\n'Now, mamma,' said Katie, 'if you laugh once while you are reading it,\nyou'll spoil it all.'\n\n'I'll do the best I can, my dear, but I'm sure I shall break down; you\nhave made it so very abusive,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Mamma, I think I'll take out that about official priggism--hadn't I\nbetter, Linda?'\n\n'Indeed, I think you had; I'm sure mamma would break down there,' said\nLinda. 'Mamma, I'm sure you would never get over the official priggism.'\n\n'I don't think I should, my dear,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'What is it you are all concocting?' said Captain Cuttwater; 'some\ninfernal mischief, I know, craving your pardons.'\n\n'If you tell, Uncle Bat, I'll never forgive you,' said Katie.\n\n'Oh, you may trust me; I never spoil sport, if I can't make any; but the\nfun ought to be very good, for you've been a mortal long time about it.'\n\nAnd then the two younger ladies again went on clipping and arranging\ntheir papers, while Mrs. Woodward renewed her protest that she would do\nher best as to reading their production. While they were thus employed\nthe postman's knock was heard, and a letter was brought in from the\nfar-away Australian exiles. The period at which these monthly missives\narrived were moments of intense anxiety, and the letter was seized upon\nwith eager avidity. It was from Gertrude to her mother, as all these\nletters were; but in such a production they had a joint property, and it\nwas hardly possible to say who first mastered its contents.\n\nIt will only be necessary here to give some extracts from the letter,\nwhich was by no means a short one. So much must be done in order that\nour readers may know something of the fate of those who perhaps may be\ncalled the hero and heroine of the tale. The author does not so call\nthem; he professes to do his work without any such appendages to his\nstory--heroism there may be, and he hopes there is--more or less of it\nthere should be in a true picture of most characters; but heroes and\nheroines, as so called, are not commonly met with in our daily walks of\nlife.\n\nBefore Gertrude's letter had been disposed of, Norman and Charley came\nin, and it was therefore discussed in full conclave. Alaric's path in\nthe land of his banishment had not been over roses. The upward struggle\nof men, who have fallen from a high place once gained, that second\nmounting of the ladder of life, seldom is an easy path. He, and with him\nGertrude and his children, had been called on to pay the full price of\nhis backsliding. His history had gone with him to the Antipodes; and,\nthough the knowledge of what he had done was not there so absolute a\nclog upon his efforts, so overpowering a burden, as it would have been\nin London, still it was a burden and a heavy one.\n\nIt had been well for Gertrude that she had prepared herself to give up\nall her luxuries by her six months' residence in that Millbank Paradise\nof luxuries: for some time she had little enough in the 'good and happy\nland,' to which she had taught herself and her children to look forward.\nThat land of promise had not flowed with milk and honey when first she\nput her foot upon its soil; its produce for her had been gall and bitter\nherbs for many a weary month after she first landed. But her heart had\nnever sunk within her. She had never forgotten that he, if he were to\nwork well, should have at least one cheerful companion by his side. She\nhad been true to him, then as ever. And yet it is so hard to be true to\nhigh principles in little things. The heroism of the Roman, who, for his\ncountry's sake, leapt his horse into a bottomless gulf, was as nothing\nto that of a woman who can keep her temper through poverty, and be\ncheerful in adversity.\n\nThrough poverty, scorn, and bad repute, under the privations of a hard\nlife, separated from so many that she had loved, and from everything\nthat she had liked, Gertrude had still been true to her ideas of her\nmarriage vow; true, also, to her pure and single love. She had entwined\nherself with him in sunny weather; and when the storm came she did her\nbest to shelter the battered stem to which she had trusted herself.\n\nBy degrees things mended with them; and in this letter, which is now\npassing from eager hand to hand in Katie's drawing-room, Gertrude spoke\nwith better hope of their future prospects.\n\n'Thank God, we are once more all well,' she said; 'and Alaric's spirits\nare higher than they were. He has, indeed, had much to try them. They\nthink, I believe, in England, that any kind of work here is sure to\ncommand a high price; of this I am quite sure, that in no employment in\nEngland are people so tasked as they are here. Alaric was four months in\nthese men's counting-house, and I am sure another four months would have\nseen him in his grave. Though I knew not then what other provision might\nbe made for us, I implored him, almost on my knees, to give up that.\nHe was expected to be there for ten, sometimes twelve, hours a day; and\nthey thought he should always be kept going like a steam-engine. You\nknow Alaric never was afraid of work; but that would have killed him.\nAnd what was it for? What did they give him for that--for all his\ntalent, all his experience, all his skill? And he did give them all. His\nsalary was two pounds ten a week! And then, when he told them of all he\nwas doing for them, they had the baseness to remind him of----. Dearest\nmother, is not the world hard? It was that that made me insist that he\nshould leave them.'\n\nAlaric's present path was by no means over roses. This certainly was a\nchange from those days on which he had sat, one of a mighty trio, at the\nCivil Service Examination Board, striking terror into candidates by\na scratch of his pen, and making happy the desponding heart by his\napproving nod. His ambition now was not to sit among the magnates of\nGreat Britain, and make his voice thunder through the columns of the\n_Times_; it ranged somewhat lower at this period, and was confined for\nthe present to a strong desire to see his wife and bairns sufficiently\nfed, and not left absolutely without clothing. He inquired little as to\nthe feeling of the electors of Strathbogy.\n\nAnd had he utterly forgotten the stirring motto of his early days? Did\nhe ever mutter 'Excelsior' to himself, as, with weary steps, he dragged\nhimself home from that hated counting-house? Ah! he had fatally mistaken\nthe meaning of the word which he had so often used. There had been the\nerror of his life. 'Excelsior!' When he took such a watchword for his\nuse, he should surely have taught himself the meaning of it.\n\nHe had now learnt that lesson in a school somewhat of the sternest; but,\nas time wore kindly over him, he did teach himself to accept the lesson\nwith humility. His spirit had been wellnigh broken as he was carried\nfrom that court-house in the Old Bailey to his prison on the river-side;\nand a broken spirit, like a broken goblet, can never again become whole.\nBut Nature was a kind mother to him, and did not permit him to be wholly\ncrushed. She still left within the plant the germ of life, which enabled\nit again to spring up and vivify, though sorely bruised by the heels\nof those who had ridden over it. He still repeated to himself the old\nwatchword, though now in humbler tone and more bated breath; and it may\nbe presumed that he had now a clearer meaning of its import.\n\n'But his present place,' continued Gertrude, 'is much--very much more\nsuited to him. He is corresponding clerk in the first bank here, and\nthough his pay is nearly double what it was at the other place, his\nhours of work are not so oppressive. He goes at nine and gets away at\nfive--that is, except on the arrival or dispatch of the English mails.'\nHere was a place of bliss for a man who had been a commissioner,\nattending at the office at such hours as best suited himself, and having\nclerks at his beck to do all that he listed. And yet, as Gertrude said,\nthis was a place of bliss to him. It was a heaven as compared with that\nother hell.\n\n'Alley is such a noble boy,' said Gertrude, becoming almost joyous as\nshe spoke of her own immediate cares. 'He is most like Katie, I think,\nof us all; and yet he is very like his papa. He goes to a day-school\nnow, with his books slung over his back in a bag. You never saw such\na proud little fellow as he is, and so manly. Charley is just like\nyou--oh! so like. It makes me so happy that he is. He did not talk so\nearly as Alley, but, nevertheless, he is more forward than the other\nchildren I see here. The little monkeys! they are neither of them the\nleast like me. But one can always see oneself, and it don't matter if\none does not.'\n\n'If ever there was a brick, Gertrude is one,' said Norman.\n\n'A brick!' said Charley--'why you might cut her to pieces, and build\nanother Kensington palace out of the slices. I believe she is a brick.'\n\n'I wonder whether I shall ever see her again?' said Mrs. Woodward, not\nwith dry eyes.\n\n'Oh yes, mamma,' said Katie. 'She shall come home to us some day, and we\nwill endeavour to reward her for it all.'\n\nDear Katie, who will not love you for such endeavour? But, indeed, the\nreward for heroism cometh not here.\n\nThere was much more in the letter, but enough has been given for our\npurpose. It will be seen that hope yet remained both for Alaric and his\nwife; and hope not without a reasonable base. Bad as he had been, it had\nnot been with him as with Undy Scott. The devil had not contrived to put\nhis whole claw upon him. He had not divested himself of human affections\nand celestial hopes. He had not reduced himself to the present level\nof a beast, with the disadvantages of a soul and of an eternity, as\nthe other man had done. He had not put himself beyond the pale of true\nbrotherhood with his fellow-men. We would have hanged Undy had the law\npermitted us; but now we will say farewell to the other, hoping that he\nmay yet achieve exaltation of another kind.\n\nAnd to thee, Gertrude--how shall we say farewell to thee, excluded as\nthou art from that dear home, where those who love thee so well are now\nso happy? Their only care remaining is now thy absence. Adversity has\ntried thee in its crucible, and thou art found to be of virgin gold,\nunalloyed; hadst thou still been lapped in prosperity, the true ring of\nthy sterling metal would never have been heard. Farewell to thee, and\nmay those young budding flowerets of thine break forth into golden fruit\nto gladden thy heart in coming days!\n\nThe reading of Gertrude's letter, and the consequent discussion,\nsomewhat put off the execution of the little scheme which had been\ndevised for that evening's amusement; but, nevertheless, it was still\nbroad daylight when Mrs. Woodward consigned the precious document to\nher desk; the drawing-room windows were still open, and the bairns were\nstill being fondled in the room. It was the first week in July, when\nthe night almost loses her dominion, and when those hours which she\ngenerally claims as her own, become the pleasantest of the day.\n\n'Oh, Charley,' said Katie, at last, 'we have great news for you, too.\nHere is another review on \"The World's Last Wonder.\"'\n\nNow 'The World's Last Wonder' was Charley's third novel; but he was\nstill sensitive enough on the subject of reviews to look with much\nanxiety for what was said of him. These notices were habitually sent\ndown to him at Hampton, and his custom was to make his wife or her\nmother read them, while he sat by in lordly ease in his arm-chair,\nreceiving homage when homage came to him, and criticizing the critics\nwhen they were uncivil.\n\n'Have you?' said Charley. 'What is it? Why did you not show it me\nbefore?'\n\n'Why, we were talking of dear Gertrude,' said Katie; 'and it is not so\npleasant but that it will keep. What paper do you think it is?'\n\n'What paper? how on earth can I tell?--show it me.'\n\n'No; but do guess, Charley; and then mamma will read it--pray guess\nnow.'\n\n'Oh, bother, I can't guess. _The Literary Censor_, I suppose--I know\nthey have turned against me.'\n\n'No, it's not that,' said Linda; 'guess again.'\n\n'_The Guardian Angel_,' said Charley.\n\n'No--that angel has not taken you under his wings as yet,' said Katie.\n\n'I know it's not the _Times_,' said Charley, 'for I have seen that.'\n\n'O no,' said Katie, seriously; 'if it was anything of that sort, we\nwould not keep you in suspense.'\n\n'Well, I'll be shot if I guess any more--there are such thousands of\nthem.'\n\n'But there is only one _Daily Delight_,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Nonsense!' said Charley. 'You don't mean to tell me that my dear old\nfriend and foster-father has fallen foul of me--my old teacher and\nmaster, if not spiritual pastor; well--well--well! The ingratitude of\nthe age! I gave him my two beautiful stories, the first-fruits of my\nvine, all for love; to think that he should now lay his treacherous axe\nto the root of the young tree--well, give it here.'\n\n'No--mamma will read it--we want Harry to hear it.'\n\n'O yes--let Mrs. Woodward read it,' said Harry. 'I trust it is severe.\nI know no man who wants a dragging over the coals more peremptorily than\nyou do.'\n\n'Thankee, sir. Well, grandmamma, go on; but if there be anything very\nbad, give me a little notice, for I am nervous.'\n\nAnd then Mrs. Woodward began to read, Linda sitting with Katie's baby in\nher arms, and Katie performing a similar office for her sister.\n\n\"'The World's Last Wonder,' by Charles Tudor, Esq.\"\n\n'He begins with a lie,' said Charley, 'for I never called myself\nEsquire.'\n\n'Oh, that was a mistake,' said Katie, forgetting herself.\n\n'Men of that kind shouldn't make such mistakes,' said Charley. 'When one\nfellow attempts to cut up another fellow, he ought to take special care\nthat he does it fairly.'\n\n\"By the author of 'Bathos.'\"\n\n'I didn't put that in,' said Charley, 'that was the publisher. I only\nput Charles Tudor.'\n\n'Don't be so touchy, Charley, and let me go on,' said Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Well, fire away--it's good fun to you, I dare say, as the fly said to\nthe spider.'\n\n'Well, Charley, at any rate we are not the spiders,' said Linda. Katie\nsaid nothing, but she could not help feeling that she must look rather\nspiderish.\n\n'Mr. Tudor has acquired some little reputation as a humorist, but as is\nso often the case with those who make us laugh, his very success will\nprove his ruin.'\n\n'Then upon my word the _Daily Delight_ is safe,' said Charley. 'It will\nnever be ruined in that way.'\n\n'There is an elaborate jocosity about him, a determined eternity of most\nindustrious fun, which gives us the idea of a boy who is being rewarded\nfor having duly learnt by rote his daily lesson out of Joe Miller.'\n\n'Now, I'll bet ten to one he has never read the book at all--well, never\nmind--go on.'\n\n\"'The World's Last Wonder' is the description of a woman who kept a\nsecret under certain temptations to reveal it, which, as Mr. Tudor\nsupposes, might have moved any daughter of Eve to break her faith.\"\n\n'I haven't supposed anything of the kind,' said Charley.\n\n'This secret, which we shall not disclose, as we would not wish to be\nthought less trustworthy than Mr. Tudor's wonderful woman--'\n\n'We shall find that he does disclose it, of course; that is the way with\nall of them.'\n\n--'Is presumed to permeate the whole three volumes.'\n\n'It is told at full length in the middle of the second,' said Charley.\n\n'And the effect upon the reader of course is, that he has ceased to\ninterest himself about it, long before it is disclosed to him!\n\n'The lady in question is engaged to be married to a gentleman, a\ncircumstance which in the pages of a novel is not calculated to attract\nmuch special attention. She is engaged to be married, but the gentleman\nwho has the honour of being her intended sposo----'\n\n'Intended sposo!' said Charley, expressing by his upturned lip a\nwithering amount of scorn--'how well I know the fellow's low attempts at\nwit! That's the editor himself--that's my literary papa. I know him as\nwell as though I had seen him at it.'\n\nKatie and Mrs. Woodward exchanged furtive glances, but neither of them\nmoved a muscle of her face.\n\n'But the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo,'\ncontinued Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'What the devil's a sposo?' said Uncle Bat, who was sitting in an\narm-chair with a handkerchief over his head.\n\n'Why, you're not a sposo, Uncle Bat,' said Linda; 'but Harry is, and so\nis Charley.'\n\n'Oh, I see,' said the captain; 'it's a bird with his wings clipped.'\n\n'But the gentleman who has the honour of being her intended sposo----'\nagain read Mrs. Woodward.\n\n'Now I'm sure I'm speaking by the card,' said Charley, 'when I say that\nthere is not another man in London who could have written that line, and\nwho would have used so detestable a word. I think I remember his using\nit in one of his lectures to me; indeed I'm sure I do. Sposo! I should\nlike to tweak his nose oh!'\n\n'Are you going to let me go on?' said Mrs. Woodward--'her intended\nsposo'--Charley gave a kick with his foot and satisfied himself with\nthat--'is determined to have nothing to say to her in the matrimonial\nline till she has revealed to him this secret which he thinks concerns\nhis own honour.'\n\n'There, I knew he'd tell it.'\n\n'He has not told it yet,' said Norman.\n\n'The lady, however, is obdurate, wonderfully so, of course, seeing that\nshe is the world's last wonder, and so the match is broken off. But\nthe secret is of such a nature that the lady's invincible objection to\nrevealing it is bound up with the fact of her being a promised bride.'\n\n'I wonder he didn't say sposa,' said Charley.\n\n'I never thought of that,' said Katie.\n\nMrs. Woodward and Linda looked at her, but Charley did not, and her\nblunder passed by unnoticed.\n\n'Now that she is free from her matrimonial bonds, she is free also to\ntell the secret; and indeed the welfare both of the gentleman and of the\nlady imperiously demands that it should be told. Should he marry her, he\nis destined to learn it after his marriage; should he not marry her, he\nmay hear it at any time. She sends for him and tells him, not the first\nof these facts, by doing which all difficulty would have at once been\nput an end to--'\n\n'It is quite clear he has never read the story, quite clear,' said\nCharley.\n\n'She tells him only the last, viz., that as they are now strangers he\nmay know the secret; but that when once known it will raise a barrier\nbetween them that no years, no penance, no sorrow on his part, no\ntenderness on hers, can ever break down. She then asks him--will he hear\nthe secret?'\n\n'She does not ask any such thing,' said Charley; 'the letter that\ncontains it has been already sent to him. She merely gives him an\nopportunity of returning it unopened.'\n\n'The gentleman, who is not without a grain of obstinacy in his own\ncomposition and many grains of curiosity, declares it to be impossible\nthat he can go to the altar in ignorance of facts which he is bound\nto know, and the lady, who seems to be of an affectionate disposition,\nfalls in tenderness at his feet. She is indeed in a very winning mood,\nand quite inclined to use every means allowable to a lady for retaining\nher lover; every means that is short of that specially feminine one of\ntelling her secret.\n\n'We will give an extract from this love scene, partly for the sake of\nits grotesque absurdity--'\n\nCharley kicked out another foot, as though he thought that the editor of\nthe _Daily Delight_ might perhaps be within reach.\n\n'--And partly because it gives a fair example of the manner in which\nMr. Tudor endeavours to be droll even in the midst of his most tender\npassages.\n\n'Leonora was at this time seated--'\n\n'Oh, skip the extract,' said Charley; 'I suppose there are three or four\npages of it?'\n\n'It goes down to where Leonora says that his fate and her own are in his\nhands.'\n\n'Yes, about three columns,' said Charley; 'that's an easy way of making\nan article--eh, Harry?'\n\n'_Aliter non fit, amice, liber_,' said the classical Norman.\n\n'Well, skip the extract, grandmamma.'\n\n'Now, did anyone ever before read such a mixture of the bombastic and\nthe burlesque? We are called upon to cry over every joke, and, for the\nlife of us, we cannot hold our sides when the catastrophes occur. It is\na salad in which the pungency of the vinegar has been wholly subdued\nby the oil, and the fatness of the oil destroyed by the tartness of the\nvinegar.'\n\n'His old simile,' said Charley; 'he was always talking about literary\nsalads.'\n\n'The gentleman, of course, gives way at the last minute,' continued Mrs.\nWoodward. 'The scene in which he sits with the unopened letter lying on\nhis table before him has some merit; but this probably arises from the\nfact that the letter is dumb, and the gentleman equally so.'\n\n'D----nation!' said Charley, whose patience could not stand such\nimpudence at this.\n\n'The gentleman, who, as we should have before said, is the eldest son of\na man of large reputed fortune----'\n\n'There--I knew he'd tell it.'\n\n'Oh, but he hasn't told it,' said Norman.\n\n'Doesn't the word 'reputed' tell it?'\n\n'--The eldest son of a man of large reputed fortune, does at last marry\nthe heroine; and then he discovers--But what he discovers, those who\nfeel any interest in the matter may learn from the book itself; we must\nprofess that we felt none.\n\n'We will not say there is nothing in the work indicative of talent.\nThe hero's valet, Jacob Brush, and the heroine's lady's-maid, Jacintha\nPintail, are both humorous and good in their way. Why it should be so,\nwe do not pretend to say; but it certainly does appear to us that Mr.\nTudor is more at home in the servants' hall than in the lady's boudoir.'\n\n'Abominable scoundrel!' said Charley.\n\n'But what we must chiefly notice,' continued the article, 'in the\nfurtherance of those views by which we profess that we are governed--'\n\n'Now, I know, we are to have something very grandiloquent and very\nfalse,' said Charley.\n\n'--Is this: that no moral purpose can be served by the volumes before\nus. The hero acts wrongly throughout, but nevertheless he is rewarded at\nlast. There is no Nemesis--'\n\n'No what?' said Charley, jumping up from his chair and looking over the\ntable.\n\n'No Nemesis,' said Mrs. Woodward, speaking with only half-sustained\nvoice, and covering with her arms the document which she had been\nreading.\n\nCharley looked sharply at his wife, then at Linda, then at Mrs.\nWoodward. Not one of them could keep her face. He made a snatch at the\npatched-up manuscript, and as he did so, Katie almost threw out of her\narms the baby she was holding.\n\n'Take him, Harry, take him,' said she, handing over the child to his\nfather. And then gliding quick as thought through the furniture of the\ndrawing-room, she darted out upon the lawn, to save herself from the\ncoming storm.\n\nCharley was quickly after her; but as he made his exit, one chair fell\nto the right of him, and another to the left. Mrs. Woodward followed\nthem, and so did Harry and Linda, each with a baby.\n\nAnd then Captain Cuttwater, waking from his placid nap, rubbed his eyes\nin wondering amazement.\n\n'What the devil is all the row about?' said he. But there was nobody to\nanswer him.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE CLERKS***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 7481-8.txt or 7481-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/7\/4\/8\/7481\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing\nthe number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array\nof equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\nplease visit: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\na copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":1044,"split":"train"}
